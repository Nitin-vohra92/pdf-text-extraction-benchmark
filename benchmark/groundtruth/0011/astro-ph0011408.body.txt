On the spin-up of neutron stars to millisecond pulsars in long-period binaries

Introduction

Ever since the detection of the first millisecond pulsar (Backer et al. 1982) it has been clear that a ms-pulsar is a neutron star (NS) which has been spun up by accretion in a close binary system (for a review see Bhattacharya & van den Heuvel 1991). Because the amount of mass needed to spin up a NS to ms periods is rather small, i.e. [formula] (Burderi et al. 1999) and the mass available from the donor is typically many times larger, i.e. typically of order [formula], it appeared as if there was no problem spinning up a NS to such short periods. Yet in recent years, evidence has accumulated which shows that NS are inefficient accretors. Thorsett & Chakrabarty (1999) noted that in all cases where the mass of a NS could be measured with precision it turned out to be in the very narrow interval [formula]. Even if one makes the extreme assumption that all NSs are born with exactly the same mass, this would imply that none of these NSs could have accreted more than [formula], despite the fact that some of these NSs have been spun up by accretion and the mass available from the donor star was probably much larger than [formula]. In another context, King & Ritter (1999) have presented further evidence that NSs can be very inefficient accretors. The main reason for this low accretion efficiency is the frequent disparity between the mass transfer rate provided by the donor star and the maximum rate at which the NS can accrete. The latter is approximately the Eddington rate [formula], whereas, depending on circumstances, the former can be larger by many orders of magnitude.

One of the obvious places in which NSs can be spun up to ms-pulsars are wide binaries in which a NS accretes from a giant. Tauris & Savonije (1999) have recently devoted a detailed study to this formation channel. One of their predictions is that, in principle, ms-pulsars should form in binaries with final orbital periods of up to P≃1000d, even when taking into account that the mass transfer rate in long-period systems ([formula]) exceeds the Eddington accretion rate. In addition, their calculations predict a correlation between the final orbital period and the mass of the ms-pulsar. Unfortunately, this cannot be tested at present. But their first prediction can. And here observations show, contrary to their prediction, that there are no ms-pulsars in wide binaries with a circular orbit and a period [formula] (see e.g. table 1 in Taam, King & Ritter 2000). In this context, Li & Wang (1998) have already noted that the accretion efficiency of the NS in such a binary is far lower than has been assumed by Tauris & Savonije (1999) if one takes into account the fact that in all these wide binaries the accretion disc around the NS is thermally unstable and accretion is transient (King et al. 1997). This is because a) during an outburst the mass flow rate through the disc is much larger than the mass transfer rate from the donor, which, in turn, is already super-Eddington if [formula], and b) because a NS cannot accrete in excess of the Eddington rate. In fact, Li & Wang (1998) found that if the duty cycle of the disc instability limit cycle is [formula] then in systems with a final orbital period [formula] the total mass accreted by the NS is [formula] few [formula], too little to spin up a NS to ms periods.

In this paper we elaborate on the idea of Li & Wang (1998) and derive explicit expressions for the duty cycle and the accretion efficiency of the NS in terms of the parameters of the binary system and the outburst cycle. Our calculations show that if the duration of the quiescent phase between two subsequent outbursts exceeds a few decades, the accretion efficiency becomes so small that in binaries with a final orbital period [formula], the NS cannot accrete enough mass to become a ms pulsar.

Basic model ingredients

The binary systems for which we wish to decribe the accretion processes are wide, long-period binaries with orbital periods of typically [formula] and in which a neutron star primary of mass M1 accretes from a giant secondary, of mass M2. The basic model ingredients we use can be summarized as follows:

Mass transfer

We assume that mass transfer from the secondary is thermally (and adiabatically) stable. In this case, the mass transfer rate can be computed from a simple analytical approximation (e.g. Ritter 1999). Following King et al. (1997) and using the same model parameters we can write for the mass transfer rate

[formula]

where [formula] is the orbital period in days, ζe the thermal equilibrium mass-radius exponent of the donor star, and ζR the mass-radius exponent of the donor's critical Roche radius. For (thermal) stability we require ζe  -  ζR  >  0 (e.g. Ritter 1988).

Disc irradiation

Accretion on to a compact star can result in significant external irradiation of the accretion disc by the central accretion source (e.g. van Paradijs 1996). Here we follow King & Ritter (1998) and assume that the effective temperature of the disc is kept above the hydrogen ionization temperature TH≃6500K by irradiation from the central accretion source out to a radius

[formula]

where [formula] is the central accretion rate, and, for a neutron star accretor, B1  =  3.9  ×  105 cgs (King & Ritter 1998). Furthermore, we shall assume that the neutron star cannot accrete in excess of the Eddington accretion rate [formula], i.e. that [formula]. This means that the maximum radius out to which the disc can be kept hot by irradiation, i.e. at Teff  >  TH, is

[formula]

Here [formula] and b1  =  B1 / 3.9  ×  105 cgs. At the same time our assumption that [formula] means that whenever the mass flow rate through the disc is [formula], the excess matter must be ejected from the disc.

The α-disc model

For describing the properties of the accretion disc around the neutron star we use the Shakura & Sunyaev (1973) α-disc model. Accordingly, if the vertical temperature stratification of the disc is dominated by viscous heating, the disc viscosity is (e.g. Frank, King & Raine 1992)

[formula]

where [formula] is the mass flow rate through the disc, R the disc radius, [formula], and [formula]. α is the viscosity parameter, here assumed to be constant with radius.

(4) holds only to the extent that the vertical temperature stratification in the disc is dominated by viscous heating, hence its dependence on [formula]. If, on the other hand, the disc is strongly heated by external irradiation, the vertical temperature profile becomes nearly isothermal at the irradiation temperature Tirr. Taking this into account in the α-viscosity ansatz we find (see also King 1998)

[formula]

Here R is the gas constant and μ the mean molecular weight.

The maximum suface density which a disc can reach in the cool state, i.e. before it becomes thermally unstable and must turn into the hot state, is conventionally denoted by ΣB. Taking ΣB from computations of Ludwig, Meyer-Hofmeister & Ritter (1995), the mass accumulated before an outburst sets in can be written as

[formula]

Here [formula], where Rd is the outer radius of those parts of the disc which are involved in the outburst, αc the α-parameter in the cool state, and F  <  1 is the filling factor defined by this equation. F takes into acount that a the onset of an outburst Σ  =  ΣB at only one point in the disc and that Σ  <  ΣB elsewhere.

Assumptions about the disc instability limit cycle

We shall assume that the disc instability limit cycle in these wide, long-period binary systems with a neutron star accretor can be described as follows:

Disc accretion in long-period neutron star binaries

Here we are mainly interested in systems which end their nuclear time scale-driven mass transfer at very long orbital periods, i.e. [formula]. With the analytical solution (Ritter 1999) one can show that the corresponding initial periods at which stable mass transfer must have started are typically [formula], (the precise value depending on whether mass transfer is conservative or not, cf. Taam et al. 2000). It has been shown by King et al. (1997) and Li & Wang (1999) that at such long periods the mass transfer rate provided by nuclear evolution of the donor is always too small for stable disc accretion, i.e. the systems in question are transient, going through a disc instability limit cycle.

In addition, the orbital period at which Rdisc  =  Rcrit (with Rdisc  >  Rcrit for longer periods) is

[formula]

where R1,R is the critical Roche radius of the primary. Thus, for practically all systems in question we also have [formula].

As we shall argue below, during most of an outburst the mass flow rate through the outer parts of the active disc is highly super-Eddington in the sense that [formula]. Therefore, at least initially, in these systems [formula] = const.

Now, if the viscosity at R  =  Rd does not depend on [formula], and Rd itself is constant, both the mass and the mass flow rate through the outer parts of the active disc decay exponentially on the viscous time scale

[formula]

at the outer radius of the active disc. If initially [formula], we have [formula] as long as [formula] and the disc is essentially emptied during the super-Eddington phase which lasts for a time

[formula]

This is the behaviour to be expected if the active part of the disc is dominated by irradiation, i.e. if νvisc is given by (5). If, on the other hand, viscous heating still dominates the vertical temperature structure, νvisc is given by (4). Using (4) in (8) we see that [formula], i.e. that the mass flow rate and the mass in the active part of the disc do not decay exponentially but rather as

[formula]

where

[formula]

is the time scale on which the disc mass decays initially. If, initially, [formula], the disc is essentially emptied during the super-Eddington phase which lasts in this case for the time

[formula]

where

[formula]

is the time scale on which the disc mass decreases once [formula] reaches [formula].

The duration of the quiescent phase is given by the time it takes to replenish the matter which has been lost (accreted/ejected) from the active part of the disc during the previous outburst. Because we have assumed that the active disc is fed at the rate [formula], irrespective of whether Rdisc is larger or smaller than Rd, the duration of quiescence is

[formula]

The total length of an outburst cycle is then

[formula]

and the duty cycle of the outbursts

[formula]

To decide the question of how much the neutron star can accrete, the quantity we need is the accretion efficiency η. Because the mass accreted over one cycle is [formula], whereas the mass transferred over the same time is [formula], we have

[formula]

Writing

[formula]

we obtain

[formula]

if the mass flow rate decays exponentially, i.e. if (5) is used, and

[formula]

if (4), i.e. (10) holds. In both cases, it is immediately seen that η is small if x  ≫  1, i.e. if during the initial phases of an outburst the mass flow rate is highly super-Eddington.

The mass flow rate through the outer disc

In order to get η, we need to know x, i.e. [formula]. Assuming again that [formula], [formula], and using (2), (5), (6) and (8) we find

[formula]

We note that [formula] as given in (21), and therefore also η, still depends on the orbital period. The dependence on P enters in a subtle way via the filling factor F which itself must be a function of [formula] and hence via (1) of P. Unfortunately, this dependence is not explicitly known and can only be determined from full time-dependent calculations of the disc evolution.

Replacing α- 4 / 5cF in (21) by means of (6), noting that

[formula]

we get rid of the poorly known quantities αc and F at the price of introducing tq. This yields

[formula]

Inserting typical values in (23), i.e [formula] we find x≃1.25tq(yr) at P = 20d and x≃10.6tq(yr) at P = 200d. This shows that if the quiescent time of these discs is long, i.e.   >   a few decades, the accretion efficiency becomes very small. Unfortunately, we do not have any direct observational information about tq. However the analogy with the properties of the outbursts in black hole soft X-ray transients (BHSXTs) (see e.g. King & Ritter 1998) suggests that the quiescent times are likely to be very long, i.e. longer than several decades. In the Discussion below we show that the absence of any observed outbursts from the progenitors of pulsars in wide circular binaries supports this conclusion. We note in passing that [formula] must not be too large if this picture is to be self-consistent: the assumption that νvisc is dominated by external irradiation, i.e. that we may use (5), requires that

[formula]

If instead of (5) we use (4), i.e. a viscosity where the disc temperature is self-consistently determined by viscous dissipation, we obtain:

[formula]

Inserting the same typical values as above in (25) we obtain x≃0.7tq(yr)10 / 7 at P = 20d and x≃15tq(yr)10 / 7 at P = 200d. From this it is seen that if only [formula]few yr, disc accretion becomes even more inefficient if the viscosity is due to viscous dissipation rather than external irradiation. We also note that even if (24) is violated initially, the disc's evolution will eventually be dominated by external heating because [formula] decreases with time.

Finally, in the case of irradiation-dominated viscosity (5) the duty cycle becomes

[formula]

Although at a first glance d does not seem to depend on P it nevertheless does: besides a weak dependence on P via ln x there is a significant one from the factor [formula]. On the one hand [formula] depends explicitly on P (cf (1)), on the other hand a more subtle dependence which we have mentioned already earlier enters via the filling factor F in (6). Nevertheless, if typical parameters are used in (26), i.e. αh≃0.2, [formula] and m1  =  1.4, we have d≃0.12  t- 1q(yr)  ·   ln x. Therefore, if tq≃ many decades, d  ≪  1.

Discussion and Conclusions

Li & Wang (1998) have shown that the accretion efficiency of neutron stars which accrete from a giant is very small and, in fact, becomes too small for spinning up the neutron star to millisecond spin periods in systems with a final orbital period [formula] if the duty cycle [formula]. Here we have worked out explicit expressions for d and the accretion efficiency η in terms of the binary parameters and the quiescent time tq of the outburst cycle in the framework of an irradiated α-disc model. Our calculations show that both, d and η are small if P  >  Pcrit and the mass flow rate at the onset of an outburst is highly super-Eddington. Whether or not d and η are really small enough to prevent neutron stars in systems with [formula] being spun up to ms-periods depends crucially on the duration of quiescence tq. If [formula] many decades, as some observations of BHSXTs suggest, then both η and d are very small indeed. Unfortunately, determining tq in the framework of our simple model is not possible. For this fully time-dependent calculations of the disc instability limit cycle would be needed.

However there is another way that we can get a lower limit on d. We know that pulsars in wide circular binaries must have descended from SXTs. Yet we do not know of a single transient with a period longer than 11.8d (GRO J1744-28), even though X-ray satellites would probably have detected an outburst from such a system anywhere in the Galaxy within the last ~  30 yr. This must mean that outbursts are rather infrequent, i.e. tq is long. We can make this more precise by defining the following quantities:

Let n be the frequency of X-ray outbursts from all systems in the Galaxy, NPSR,obs the currently known number of the pulsar binaries in question, NPSR the current number of the pulsar binaries in question in the Galaxy, τprog the lifetime of a progenitor system in the phase of nuclear time scale mass transfer, and τPSR the lifetime of the pulsar in the pulsar binaries in question. Here τprog and τPSR are suitable averages over the relevant population.

Now, the inventory of the binary pulsars in question is incomplete because of flux limitation, dispersion and beaming, whereas an X-ray outburst in one of the progenitor systems would probably be seen wherever in the Galaxy the outburst occurs. We correct for this incompletness by introducing a 'filling factor' f  <  1. In a stationary situation we then must have

[formula]

τPSR must be of the order of the spin-down time scale [formula], τprog, on the other hand, is of the order of the nuclear time scale t∞ defined in Ritter (1999, Eq. 14) which, for the systems in question, i.e. those which end their evolution with a long orbital period [formula], is of the order 108  ~  yr. With NPSR,obs = 2 (i.e. PSR B0820+02 and PSR J1803-2712), f  ≈  0.2 and from the fact that we have not seen a single outburst in the past 30  yr this yields the lower limit [formula]. We would also like to emphasize that we have adopted a very conservative value for f. The real value is likely to be smaller still and thus the estimate for tq even larger because already the canonical beaming factor for pulsars is of order 0.2.

Thus it is very likely that the lack of ms-pulsars in binaries with white dwarf companions and [formula] is entirely a consequence of dwarf nova-like disc instabilities in long-period binaries.

Finally, we note that spinning up a NS in a long-period binary faces yet another obstacle: during the long quiescent phases the NS acts as a propeller (Illarionov & Sunyaev 1975) and thereby is spun down, making the spin-up to ms spin periods even more difficult.
