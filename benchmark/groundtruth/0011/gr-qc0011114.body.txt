TESTS OF STRONG-FIELD GRAVITY AND GRAVITATIONAL RADIATION DAMPING IN BINARY-PULSAR SYSTEMS

Binary pulsars allow us to test the strong-field regime of gravity because neutron stars are compact objects: Their mass to radius ratio is of order Gm / Rc2  ~  0.2, as compared to ~  10- 6 for the Sun. The best way to illustrate the various tests available is to plot their constraints on a generic class of scalar-tensor theories,[\cite=nonpert] defined by the following action:

[formula]

where α0 and β0 are two constants characterizing the coupling of matter to the scalar field. The origin of Fig. 1 (α0  =  β0  =  0) corresponds to general relativity; the vertical axis (β0  =  0) to Brans-Dicke theory with a parameter 2ω  +  3  =  1 / α20; and the horizontal one (α0  =  0) to theories which are perturbatively equivalent to general relativity, i.e., strictly indistinguishable from it in the weak-field conditions of the solar system.

Lunar Laser Ranging experiments [\cite=etaLLR] and observations of Mercury perihelion shift exclude the region lying above the thin solid line of Fig. 1, while Very Long Baseline Interferometry [\cite=gammaVLBI] imposes the limit |α0|  <  1.4  ×  10- 2 materialized by a thin horizontal line. This figure confirms that solar-system experiments do not impose any constraint on β0 if α0 is small enough.

On the other hand, binary-pulsar data impose [\cite=nonpert] β0  >   - 4.5 even for a vanishingly small α0. In terms of the Eddington parameters βPPN and γPPN, which are both consistent with 1 in the solar system, this inequality reads (βPPN - 1)  /  (γPPN - 1)  <  1.1. This result comes mainly from the Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar,[\cite=1913] which excludes the region lying above the bold line labeled "1913+16".

The next strongest constraint is imposed by neutron star-white dwarf binaries like PSR 0655+64, which excludes the region outside the two solid lines of Fig. 1. Indeed, in scalar-tensor theories, such dissymmetrical systems emit strong dipolar gravitational waves ([formula]), generally inconsistent with the small observed value of their [formula] (rate of change of orbital period). The quadrupolar radiation ([formula]) predicted by general relativity is consistent with experimental data.

The binary pulsar [\cite=1534] PSR 1534+12 excludes the region lying to the left and top of the dashed line. This is a slightly weaker constraint than with the previous systems, but this test is nevertheless very important, because it does not depend on the radiative structure of the theory.

Scalar-tensor theories also predict a violation of the strong equivalence principle (SEP), which causes a gravitational analogue of the Stark effect on the orbit of dissymmetrical binaries.[\cite=Stark] [\cite=Wex00] The small observed eccentricities of such systems constrain the theories to lie between the two (approximate) dotted lines.

Similar analyses can also be performed to test local Lorentz invariance of gravity and conservation laws, and notably the "PPN" parameters [\cite=alpha1PSR] [\cite=Wex00] α1 and [\cite=alpha3] [\cite=Wex00] α3.
