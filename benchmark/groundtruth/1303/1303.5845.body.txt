This paper deduces estimates for the approximation numbers of positive integral operators acting on the space of square-integrable functions on compact two-point homogeneous spaces when the generating kernel satisfies a Hölder condition defined by the translation operator on the space. The procedure is new in the sense that the approximation process uses finite rank operators defined by generalized Jackson kernels, a tool that usually yields optimal approximation properties. The estimates are sharp in the sense that, the addition of a continuity assumption and an standard application of the factorization theorem for absolutely 2-summing operators leads to an estimate which is known to be not improvable.

Introduction

Let [formula] denote a compact two-point homogeneous space of dimension m. Such a space is both a Riemannian manifold and a compact symmetric space of rank 1 and belongs to one of the following categories: the unit spheres Sm, [formula], the real projective spaces [formula], [formula], the complex projective spaces [formula], [formula], the quaternionic projective spaces [formula], [formula] and Cayley's elliptic plane P16 of dimension 16. Basic information on homogeneous spaces can be found in [\cite=plat] [\cite=wang] and references quoted there. Additional information, including optimal cubature formulas and approximation of smooth functions on such spaces, are discussed in [\cite=brown] [\cite=kush].

For p = 1,2, we will deal with the Banach space [formula] of measurable complex functions on [formula] for which

[formula]

in which dx is the volume element on [formula].  The title of the paper refers to the estimation of approximation numbers of self-adjoint integral operators [formula] having the form

[formula]

with an L2-positive definite generating kernel K belonging to [formula]. We write [formula] to denote the unique square root of K and assume it is an integral operator of the same type as K, generated by a hermitian kernel [formula] which can be used to recover K in the following sense:

[formula]

A "positive integral operator" will mean an operator K satisfying all the requirements mentioned above. Continuity and positive definiteness of K in the usual sense lead to a positive integral operator K and, therefore, the setting we consider is reasonable. This implication is sketched in [\cite=ferr].

The n-th approximation number of K is the number

[formula]

in which Un stands for a bounded linear operator on [formula] of rank ρ(Un). In the L2 setting above, the approximation numbers of integral operators provide an interpretation for the singular values of the operator K. We mention [\cite=gohb] [\cite=piet] for further information on approximation numbers, including applications and relations to other important useful numbers in functional analysis and approximation theory. We observe that, modulus some modifications, the concept makes sense for bounded linear operators between Banach spaces ([\cite=piet]).

The intended target in this paper is to deduce sharp (but not necessarily optimal) estimates for the n-th approximation number of K when the generating kernel K satisfies a Hölder assumption defined by the translation operator on [formula]. Instead of using heavy machinery from functional analysis, we will make use of approximations with certain finite rank operators defined by generalized Jackson kernels. These kernels appear with considerable frequency in approximation problems involving spherical functions ([\cite=grein] [\cite=liz] [\cite=liz1] [\cite=nik] [\cite=nishi] [\cite=pawe] [\cite=plat]), saturation problems ([\cite=kawa]), discrepancy estimates ([\cite=andri] and references mentioned there), preconditioning of Toeplitz matrices ([\cite=chan] [\cite=chan1]), etc. Since the estimation of approximation numbers is done in a variety of settings in the literature, some of them even including two-point compact homogeneous spaces, we would like to emphasize that the two main differentials in this paper are: the use of a Hölder condition not considered before in the analysis of similar problems and the use of the generalized Jackson kernels and some of its properties in the deduction of the estimates.

In Section 2, we introduce the Hölder condition to be explored and construct a nontrivial example of a positive definite and continuous kernel satisfying the condition. In Section 3, we define the finite rank operators we intend to use to estimate the approximation numbers. In particular, we introduce the generalized Jackson kernels and the normalization needed. Section 4 contains all the technical arguments of the paper and culminates with a preliminary estimate for the approximation numbers of the square root of the integral operator that depend upon an integral involving the Jackson kernels. In Section 5, we deduce a sharp bound for the integral that appeared in Section 4 and obtain the main results in the paper. Section 6 contains an application, namely, the deduction of optimal decay rates for eigenvalues of the integral operator when we add a continuity assumption to the setting. In particular, we briefly describe a classical method from operator theory used to speed up decay rates.

The Hölder assumption

In this section, we will introduce the Hölder condition to be imposed on the generating kernel of K in order to estimate an(K). It depends upon the translation operator on [formula], which we introduce first.

Let |xy| denote the usual (geodesic) distance between two points x and y in [formula], normalized so that all geodesics on [formula] have the same length 2π. For f in [formula], the translation operator is given by the formula

[formula]

in which dσ(x') is the volume element of

[formula]

and σ(t) is the total volume of [formula]. As already observed in [\cite=plat1], the mapping [formula] is a bounded linear operator of norm 1. The other properties of St which are pertinent to this work can be found in [\cite=plat].

If β∈(0,2] and [formula], then a kernel K is said to be (B,β)- Hölder on [formula] when

[formula]

This Hölder assumption is intrinsic to the category of homogeneous spaces and was motivated by a discussion on Hölder spaces on the sphere Sm we encountered in [\cite=samko]. There, Hölder spaces determined by the Hölder condition introduced here are proved to include those determined by other common Hölder assumptions. The arguments in the proof of such assertion in the case of a usual Hölder condition involve the inequality

[formula]

which holds for several classes of functions, including the ones used here.

To close the section, we present a concrete example of a kernel satisfying the Hölder condition just introduced. In order to avoid additional material, we will elaborate on the example in the case [formula] only, but advise the reader that it can be done, modulus adjustments, in most of the cases covered by the setting adopted in the paper. A classical reference for the additional information used in this section is [\cite=mull]. The construction we present covers the case in which β∈(0,1] and m  ≥  2 tied so that m - β > 2. Consider the kernel K possessing an expansion in the form

[formula]

in which τm is the volume of Sm, N(m,n) is the dimension of the space of all spherical harmonics of degree n in m + 1 variables, Pmn is the Legendre polynomial of degree n associated with the integer m and ·   is the usual inner product of [formula]. The Legendre polynomials are normalized by

[formula]

This and the asymptotic behavior [formula], as n  →    ∞  , reveal that the series in the expansion above converges uniformly. Thus, the kernel K is, in fact, continuous and clearly positive definite. To proceed, first observe that, for x,x',y∈Sm,

[formula]

in which s is a number between y  ·  x' and y  ·  x. However, using well-known formulas for derivatives of the standard orthogonal polynomials (see either [\cite=zse] or formula (3.71) in [\cite=plat1]) it is easily seen that

[formula]

for some C1 = C1(m) > 0. Thus,

[formula]

for some C2 = C2(m,β) > 0. Finally, combining these findings with the equality

[formula]

leads to

[formula]

for some C3 > 0. Consequently,

[formula]

that is, K is (B,β)-Hölder with

[formula]

The auxiliary operator Un.

In order to estimate the approximation numbers of the operator K, it is necessary to choose a convenient operator Un as demanded by the formula ([\ref=appp]). We intend to use an operator Un based on the generalized Jackson kernel on [formula]. The kernel itself depends upon two positive integers l and μ  ≥  2 and is given by the formula

[formula]

the normalizing constant kν being chosen so that

[formula]

The weight α is defined by

[formula]

in which a and b are related to [formula] in the following way ([\cite=plat]):

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

In particular, both the kernel Dν and the function α depend upon the dimension m, but that will be not enforced in the notation.

To proceed, we introduce the function Φν given by

[formula]

Since Dν defines a trigonometric polynomial of degree ν in the variable t, then the range of Φν is a subspace of the space of all spherical polynomials of degree ν in the variable x. In other words, for fixed n, Φn acts on [formula] like an operator of rank at most the dimension of the space of all spherical polynomials of degree at most n on [formula]. Details and a proof for such property is the content of Lemma 2.3 of [\cite=plat].

Technical estimates

In this section, we intend to estimate [formula] employing [formula] for an appropriate choice of ν and additional assumptions on K. The why this will suffice for reaching estimates for [formula] and the eigenvalues of K, is explained at the end of Section 5.

As we shall see, one of the key arguments in our procedure is a convenient estimation of the quantity

[formula]

A crude one is given below.

Let K be an element of [formula] satisfying ([\ref=recup]). If [formula] and t∈(0,π), then

[formula]

Proof.   A simple calculation leads to the formula

[formula]

An adjustment yields

[formula]

while the recovery formula (1.1) provides the equality

[formula]

Finally, re-introducing the translation operator, we obtain

[formula]

The inequality in the statement of the lemma follows.

The next lemma justifies the appearance of Itx considered above.

Let K be a positive integral operator. If f belongs to [formula], then

[formula]

Proof.   Fix [formula] and [formula]. Formulas ([\ref=normalization]) and ([\ref=key]) imply that

[formula]

On the other hand, due to ([\ref=recup]) and ([\ref=shift]),

[formula]

so that the difference [formula] can be put into the form

[formula]

An application of Hölder's inequality yields |Dtx|  ≤  σ(t)- 1Itx.

Clearly, a critical point one needs to handle in order to be able to use the previous lemmas is to certify that Itx  <    ∞  , [formula], t∈(0,π). The addition of our Hölder condition not only guarantees that, but also provides an initial estimate for [formula].

Let K be a positive integral operator. If K is (B,β)-Hölder, then

[formula]

Proof.   If K is K is (B,β)-Hölder, we can use Lemma [\ref=lemaI] to write

[formula]

Thus,

[formula]

Including this estimate into the formula in Lemma [\ref=lemaII] we arrive at ([formula])

[formula]

Applying Hölder's inequality, we can estimate

[formula]

as follows:

[formula]

Integrating in x and interchanging the order of integration, we deduce that

[formula]

while a further estimate leads to

[formula]

Thus,

[formula]

and the inequality in the statement of the theorem follows.

It is now clear that an estimation for [formula] will depend upon estimates for the integral appearing in the previous theorem. We will provide a sharp one in the next section.

By using similar calculations, one can deduce versions of the previous two lemmas for the operator K itself. In that case, the recovery formula is no longer needed and the arguments simplify a little bit. However, the assumption [formula] is not enough for all the arguments to hold and similar results can only be reached with the stronger assumption [formula]. Details are left to the readers.

Estimates for the Jackson kernels and main results

This section begins with a convenient estimation for the integral appearing in Theorem [\ref=integ]. Since we do not have a reference where all the details appear, we will include our own proof. Similar calculations appeared in [\cite=liz] for the case in which [formula] is a sphere.

Let γ be a positive real number. If 2l > γ + m, then there exists a positive constant Cm,γ,l, depending on m, γ and l, so that

[formula]

Proof.   Fix μ  ≥  2. We begin with a lower bound for the normalizing constant kν. Using well-known inequalities involving the sine function one can see that

[formula]

The change of variable u = μt and the fact that μ  ≥  2 leads to

[formula]

An additional estimation implies that

[formula]

Going the other way around, let us write

[formula]

Basic estimation leads to

[formula]

The change of variables u = μt / 2 leads to

[formula]

The improper integral above can be estimated in two steps:

[formula]

and

[formula]

Thus,

[formula]

Since Dν = k- 1νDlμ, it is quite clear now that

[formula]

where the constant cm,γ,l is given by the formula

[formula]

The proof is complete.

The lemma below is the missing link needed in the proof of our main results.

If dmn denotes the dimension of the space of all spherical polynomials of dimension at most n in [formula] then there exists a positive integer q (depending on m) so that dmn  ≤  (qn)m, [formula].

Proof.   This follows from the asymptotic behavior [formula], as n  →    ∞  , which is explained in [\cite=brown] but also follows from formulas for dmn provided in [\cite=kush1].

Below, we write [formula].

Let K be a positive integral operator and consider the positive integer q described in the previous lemma. If K is (B,β)-Hölder and l is a fixed integer in the interval

[formula]

a() ≤ ,  n ∈ 1+l.

[formula]

Proof.   Let K and l be as in the statement of the lemma. Fix μ in the set [formula], write l(μ - 1): = n - 1, for some n, and pick the generalized Jackson kernel Dn - 1. Since 2l  ≥  2m > m + β / 2, Lemma [\ref=lemja] implies that

[formula]

for some positive constant Cm,β / 2,l. Recalling the proof of Theorem [\ref=integ], we now have that

[formula]

Our choice of l leads to an estimate of the form

[formula]

with Cm,β depending on m and β only. The rank of the operator [formula] being at most the dimension dmn - 1, we conclude that

[formula]

Finally, since the sequence of approximation numbers of an operator forms a decreasing sequence ([\cite=piet], the inequality in the statement of the lemma follows with [formula].

We now extend the previous lemma to all the integers n.

Let K be a positive integral operator and consider the positive integer q described in the previous lemma. If K is (B,β)-Hölder then there exists a constant C2 > 0 depending on m, β and B such that

[formula]

Proof.   Assume K is (B,β)-Hölder and consider an integer l fitting the description given in the previous lemma. If [formula], we can use the inequality provided by the lemma to deduce that

[formula]

Since j  ≤  l - 1  ≤  n, then

[formula]

that is,

[formula]

Consequently,

[formula]

It is now clear that there exists a constant C2 > 0, depending on m, β and B so that

[formula]

The proof is complete.

A well-known argument from advanced calculus justifies the corollary below.

Let K be a positive integral operator. If K is (B,β)-Hölder then there exists a constant C3 > 0 depending on m, β and B such that

[formula]

The setting we are working with provides relevant information about the spectrum of K: it is composed of at most countably many nonnegative eigenvalues [formula] repetitions being included in accordance with algebraic multiplicities (if K has finitely many positive eigenvalues we may complete the sequence with zeros). A similar ordering holds for the eigenvalues of [formula] and the following formula

[formula]

holds. In particular, the following decay holds true:

[formula]

The decay described above is classical when one uses a usual Hölder assumption on the generating kernel K. In many cases, the optimal decay for the eigenvalues includes an additional -1 summand in the exponent of n. As far as we know, such an optimal decay can only be reached with additional assumptions on K and the help of deeper results from functional analysis.

An application

In this section, just for the sake of completeness, we briefly explain how one needs to proceed in order to improve the decay described in Corollary [\ref=decay] to an optimal one, still keeping the setting we have adopted. The price to be paid is the addition of the following assumption: the range of [formula] is a subset of [formula], the set of all continuous functions on [formula] (this is certainly the case when K is continuous).

Let j be the inclusion map [formula] and I de identity map on [formula]. The operator j is absolutely 2-summing and we write π2(j) to denote its 2-summing norm. Invoking the factorization theorem for such operators ([\cite=piet]), one can show that each triple composition [formula] is a Hilbert-Schmidt operator with a controlled Hilbert-Schmidt norm:

[formula]

Since [formula], Lemma 2.7.3 in [\cite=piet] and Theorem [\ref=main] imply the double inequality

[formula]

that is,

[formula]

in which C2' is a positive constant depending upon β,m and B. Since the rule that assigns to every operator the sequence of its approximation numbers is an s-scale and [formula], then we can stretch the previous inequality as follows:

[formula]

Recalling Lemma [\ref=dime] and using the fact that the approximation numbers form a decreasing sequence once again, we deduce that

[formula]

The outcome is the existence of a positive constant C2'' so that

[formula]

In particular,

[formula]

that is,

[formula]
