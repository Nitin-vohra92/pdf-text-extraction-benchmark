A minimally tuned composite Higgs model from an extra dimension

Introduction

A satisfactory understanding of ElectroWeak Symmetry Breaking (EWSB) requires the existence of new physics at a scale, [formula], not far above the weak scale. We expect the new dynamics at [formula] to provide a solution to the hierarchy problem affecting the Higgs sector in the Standard Model (SM).

Constraints on generic new physics require [formula] to be at or above the TeV scale. Naturalness, on the other hand, demands low scale new physics. A completely natural theory would, for instance, require the presence of a new set of particles and interactions at a scale

[formula]

in order to cancel the quadratically divergent top quark contribution to the SM Higgs potential.

The two main frameworks in which the hierarchy problem is usually addressed are supersymmetry and compositeness. The supersymmetric way has been and still is a theorist's favorite. This rank is well deserved by the theoretical appeal of supersymmetry and its ability to make definite predictions due to its weakly coupled nature. Compositeness remains a much less studied alternative.

In the past decade a realistic framework has emerged [\cite=Contino:2003p378] [\cite=Agashe:2004ib] [\cite=Agashe:2005p372] [\cite=Contino:2006fd] [\cite=Panico:2005kd] [\cite=Barbieri:2007bh] [\cite=Contino:2010mr] in which the Higgs boson arises as a pseudo-Goldstone Boson (pGB) from the spontaneous breaking of a global symmetry G, of a new strongly interacting sector, to a subgroup H. These models have two crucial advantages over plain technicolor models. Firstly, the presence of a light Higgs boson allows the parametric separation between the G  →  H breaking scale f and the electroweak symmetry breaking scale v which is needed to alleviate the tension of technicolor models with electroweak precision tests [\cite=Barbieri:2012wia]. Secondly, the flavor problem of technicolor can be greatly improved by the implementation of partial compositeness [\cite=1991NuPhB.365..259K]. This implies that those degrees of freedom, whose elementary nature is well probed (the light quarks and leptons and the transverse polarizations of the gauge bosons), are external to the strongly interacting sector and they communicate with it only through linear couplings of the form

[formula]

where J is a global current of the strong sector which is gauged by the SM vector bosons Aμ and O is a fermionic operator (assumed to have a naive mass dimension 5 / 2) [\cite=KerenZur:2012td].

The couplings of the elementary fields to the strong sector break the global symmetry G explicitly and generate a potential for the Higgs which is calculable in specific models and whose general structure we will sketch following the discussion in Ref. [\cite=Panico:2012vr] closely. The largest contribution to the pGB potential comes typically from the interactions generating the top quark mass. The Yukawa for the top quark arises from the coupling of the elementary qL and tR to the strong sector according to the pattern sketched above in Eq. [\eqref=pc]

[formula]

where f is the sigma model decay constant and O stands for fermionic resonances of mass mψ in the low energy theory (their naive dimension is now 3 / 2). Dimensional analysis ensures the leading contribution to the top Yukawa to be

[formula]

where 1 < gψ  ~  mψ / f < 4π is the typical coupling among these fermionic resonances. The dimensionless parameters [formula] determine the degree of compositeness of the various SM fields ranging from 0 (elementary state) to 1 (composite state).

Deep insight into the structure of the Higgs potential is obtained by exploiting the symmetry properties of Eq. [\eqref=pctop]. As the strong sector obeys a global symmetry G the operators Oq and Ot can be classified according to their transformation properties under G. Furthermore when both interactions in Eq. [\eqref=pctop] and the SM gauge interactions are switched off, the action for the elementary fields is invariant under an independent SU(2)  ×  U(1) group, with charges corresponding to their SM quantum numbers. The couplings λL and λR break this large [formula] to the gauged SU(2)L  ×  U(1)Y vector subgroup. It is however possible to assign spurious transformation properties to the λs, promoting them to λ̂s, in order to make Eq. [\eqref=pctop] formally invariant under G

[formula]

α and I are irreducible SU(2)  ×  U(1) and G indices respectively.

When both the strong sector and the high energy fluctuations of the elementary modes are integrated out the resulting effective action will respect the spurious G symmetry. SU(2)  ×  U(1) invariance implies that, for instance, at leading order in λL only the combination [formula] will enter the Higgs potential. The same argument constrains the form of the λR contribution.

XL,R transform spuriously as reducible representations of G: [formula]. In order to build non-trivial (Higgs dependent) invariants that can contribute to the Higgs potential we introduce the Goldstone boson matrix U(h) transforming as [\cite=Callan:1969p1799]

[formula]

U(h) can be used to turn irreducible representations of G into reducible representations of H. Combining X with U according to their transformation properties we can construct non-linear G invariants, Ii(h / f), which depend non-trivially on the pGB h. The structure of the potential will thus be [\cite=Giudice:1024017]

[formula]

where f is the decay constant of the pGB, h is the physical Higgs field and

[formula]

i.e. each of the functions F is a sum of the non-trivial G invariants which can be constructed at a given order in ε and [formula]. Eq. [\eqref=potentialloops] allows us to determine how EWSB occurs. Generically we expect the one-loop, leading order F(1)1 contribution to be dominant. As the various F are expected to be O(1) functions of their argument, some degree of cancellation among the ci is necessary to obtain a small enough ratio ξ = (v / f)2 which is crucial for a realistic phenomenology. In the absence of other cancellations, this irreducible tuning of a composite Higgs model can be quantified by ξ itself.

The simplest realistic realization of the composite Higgs idea is represented by G = SO(5)  ×  U(1)X and H = SO(4)  ×  U(1)X. The coset space G / H contains a quadruplet of GB, three of which are eaten by the SM gauge bosons while the fourth is the physical Higgs boson. Since the Higgs is an angular variable on the compact coset manifold G / H  ~  S4, the G invariants are expected to be trigonometric functions of h / f.

For certain choices of the operators Oq,t, the leading contribution to the Higgs potential, F(1)1, contains a single invariant at O(ε2). This happens for instance in the simplest case in which both Oq and Ot transform as a [formula] of SO(5) where

[formula]

with [formula], and only a discrete set of values is available for ξ. In order to be able to tune ξ  ≪  1, it is necessary to suppress the coefficient of the leading order term in Eq. [\eqref=leadingorderterm] to be of the same order as the O(ε4) subleading contribution which will contribute with the new independent functions of h / f

[formula]

In other words we need c1  ≈  c2ε2 and the tuning is worsened to ξ  ×  ε2.

The simplest situation that avoids this peculiar behavior corresponds to the Oq being the [formula] dimensional (symmetric and traceless) representation of SO(5) and Ot being a singlet. This choice defines the MCHM14 [\cite=Pomarol:2012vn]. In the MCHM14, already F(1)1 contains two invariants and a viable EWSB can be achieved with the minimal amount of tuning.

To study the consequences of this model beyond simple dimensional analysis the calculability of the Higgs potential is a crucial property. A 4D realization of the MCHM14 has been obtained in Ref. [\cite=Pomarol:2012vn] using Weinberg's sum rules to ensure calculability. Collective breaking, used in Ref. [\cite=Panico:2012vr], led to the same result. In this paper, we follow the original approach of Ref. [\cite=Agashe:2004ib] studying a holographic realization of the MCHM14 where calculability is related to locality in an extra dimension. The only difference between our approach and the original holographic approach to composite Higgs models is the 5D metric, that we choose to be flat and not AdS5.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section [\ref=Sec:spurionanalysis], we clarify the role of symmetries and dimensional analysis in the structure of the Higgs potential of the MCHM14. We recall the general features of holographic composite Higgs models in Section [\ref=Sec:5Dmodel] and describe the setup leading to the MCHM14 in detail. In Section [\ref=Sec:results], we compute the Higgs potential and study the dependence of ξ and mh on the parameters of the 5D model. Here we study the spectrum of the fermionic resonances, their relations with the Higgs mass and the tuning of the holographic implementation. In Section [\ref=Sec:conclusion] we summarize and conclude, sketching some possible phenomenological implications of the model.

A composite Higgs with [formula] and [formula]: spurionic analysis

In this section we describe some features of the MCHM14 following from its symmetries. We begin by discussing the gauge/Goldstone sector and move on to the fermionic sector.

The Goldstone and gauge sector

The bosonic sector of the theory comprises the Goldstone bosons of the SO(5) / SO(4) coset and the gauge bosons of the SU(2)L  ×  U(1)Y SM gauge symmetry. The first appear through the matrix U(h) defined by

[formula]

where Tâ are the broken SO(5) / SO(4) generators (see Appendix [\ref=SO5generators] for their explicit expressions). Notice that U(h) is an orthogonal matrix transforming as in Eq. [\eqref=goldstones2]. Moreover, we can use U(h) to construct the 5-vector

[formula]

transforming linearly under SO(5), i.e. Σ(h)  →  g  Σ(h). In the unitary gauge this reduces to

[formula]

The gauging of the SM SU(2)L  ×  U(1)Y symmetry is introduced through the usual covariant derivative

[formula]

For fields with a nonvanishing X-charge the hypercharge is given by [formula]. In a derivative expansion the leading term in the Lagrangian of the pGB is thus

[formula]

such that mW  =  gf / 2 sin (〈h〉 / f). Furthermore, we expect the elementary gauge bosons to couple linearly to dimension 3 conserved currents of the strong sector, as discussed below Eq. [\eqref=pc]. Upon integrating out the heavy degrees of freedom of the composite sector these G-breaking interactions will generate an effective Lagrangian for the gauge bosons which can be used to derive the gauge contribution to the Higgs potential. The most general effective action for the SM gauge fields can be derived under the assumption that the full global symmetry of the strong sector G is gauged. At the quadratic level in momentum space, this SO(5)  ×  U(1)X invariant Lagrangian is given by

[formula]

where P(t)μν  =  ημν - pμpν / p2 is the transverse projector. We identify the SM gauge bosons among the SO(5)  ×  U(1)X ones according to

[formula]

Using these relations, the effective Lagrangian for the SM gauge fields becomes

[formula]

where the form factors are related to those in Eq. [\eqref=Leffgauge1] by

[formula]

The fermionic sector

We assume the existence of fermionic operators [formula] and [formula]. The subscript refers to the U(1)X charge. According to partial compositeness these operators couple to the elementary fermions through linear mixings as discussed in the Introduction

[formula]

To make contact with Eq. [\eqref=pctopinv], we define λ̂L  =  λLPL and analogously λ̂R  =  λRPR where λL and λR are numerical coefficients describing the mixing strength between the elementary states and the composite sector. Both PαL and Oq are taken to be 5  ×  5 matrices transforming as

[formula]

The index α refers to the elementary SU(2) factor discussed in the Introduction. Eq. [\eqref=pctopinvSO5] is formally invariant under a spurious symmetry group [formula] if one assumes

[formula]

The spurion PαL is given by

[formula]

with

[formula]

while PR = 1. The explicit expression for the matrix [formula] is thus

[formula]

Once the strong sector is integrated out the resulting effective Lagrangian for the light degrees of freedom has to respect the full spurionic symmetry which implies that qL and tR will only enter through the combinations ψq and [formula]. The relevant terms in the most general effective Lagrangian are thus

[formula]

where Πq0,Πt0,Πq1,Πq2,Mt1 are p2-dependent form factors that we will determine in the complete 5D theory in Section [\ref=Sec:5Dmodel] (the explicit form in 5D can be found in Appendix [\ref=App5Dfermions]). In terms of tL, bL and tR the Lagrangian in Eq. [\eqref=efflag14] becomes

[formula]

where the form factors are related by

[formula]

with [formula] and [formula]. Eq. [\eqref=efflag15] is sufficient to extract the top quark mass:

[formula]

Here the form factors are evaluated at p = 0 which neglects effects of order m2t / m2T where mT is the mass of the fermionic resonances in the strong sector. In the last equality we assumed the existence of a hierarchy Πq1,Πq2  ≪  Πq0. As we will explain below this assumption is guaranteed by partial compositeness.

The Higgs potential

As the couplings of the elementary fermions and gauge bosons break the global symmetry of the strong sector, integrating out their high energy modes at 1-loop or higher order will generate a nonvanishing potential for the Higgs boson. At 1-loop the calculation is the one of Coleman and Weinberg in Ref. [\cite=Coleman:1973jx].

The gauge contribution to the Higgs potential is obtained starting from Eq. [\eqref=Leffgauge1]. After rotation of the form factors to Euclidean space we obtain

[formula]

where p2E =  - p2 is the Euclidean momentum. The explicit expression of the form factors in a 5D model is obtained in Section [\ref=Generalities5D]. Similarly, the fermionic contribution to the Higgs potential follows from Eq. [\eqref=efflag15]

[formula]

where again all form factors are functions of the Euclidean momentum pE. The convergence of the integrals in Eq. [\eqref=CWgauge] and Eq. [\eqref=CWfermions] depends on the details of the model. In the holographic case the form factors turn out to be exponentially decreasing functions of pE, while the convergence is only power-like in discretized models.

To extract the structure of the Higgs potential we use again the relations Π1  ≪  Π0 and Πq1,Πq2  ≪  Πq0 that allow us to expand the logarithms and write the non-constant part of the potential as

[formula]

The coefficients α and β are given by The potential in Eq. [\eqref=higgspot] has a minimum for

[formula]

corresponding to a physical Higgs mass

[formula]

Assuming the gauge contribution to be subleading we can estimate the expected size of α and β using spurionic symmetries and dimensional analysis [\cite=Mrazek:2011iu]. The Lagrangian in Eq. [\eqref=pctopinvSO5] is formally invariant under the spurious symmetry group G described in the Introduction. As the composite sector and the high energy fluctuations of the SM fields are integrated out, the Higgs potential has to satisfy the spurionic symmetry G with its SO(5) subgroup being non-linearly realized. Since no non-trivial invariants can be build out of λRPR, this structure will not enter the potential. For λLPαL there are two possibilities

[formula]

[formula]

Both invariants can be generated at 1-loop order and are proportional to λ2L. The leading contribution to the potential will thus be of the form

[formula]

where a1, a2 are coefficients of order 1, and [formula] is the typical mass of the fermionic resonances cutting off the UV divergences in V(h). As a1 is naturally of the same order as a2, a given value of ξ requires a cancellation of order ξ among the parameters. The Higgs mass, on the other hand, is given by

[formula]

This implies that, to obtain the measured value of the Higgs mass in a natural way, we need εR  ≈  1 (in which case tR would be a fully composite state), a small gψ and |a2|  ~  O(1) or a suppressed quartic coupling [formula]. This second possibility will increase the tuning from ξ to ξ  ×  |a2| if it is obtained through cancellations between the two pieces in the expression of β in Eq. [\eqref=potentialcoefficients]. These considerations must be taken with a grain of salt. While the parametric behavior of mh as a function of the various parameters is a solid prediction, the overall normalization of Eq. [\eqref=higgsmass] is only an educated guess. In a specific model, numerical factors of order 1 can conspire to make |a2| somewhat larger or smaller than 1 in a completely natural way. In the former case the tuning needed to obtain a light Higgs boson would be enhanced while in the latter it would be reduced. We will show an effect of this kind in our specific example in Section [\ref=Sec:results].

The 5D construction

In order to make detailed predictions from our setup we need a framework where the Higgs potential is calculable. In this paper we follow the holographic approach where finiteness is ensured by locality in an extra dimension. We define our theory in a compact extra dimension [formula] with a flat metric

[formula]

and with L- 1 = O(). To compute the effective action for the light degrees of freedom we follow the holographic prescription as described in Ref. [\cite=Panico:2007fq].

One may question the use of the flat metric in our construction: extra dimensional models require warping in order to properly address the hierarchy problem. It is known however that it is possible to mimic the low energy behavior of a theory in warped space (AdS5 in particular) by a theory formulated in a flat extra dimension with suitable terms added to its action [\cite=Scrucca:2003cf] [\cite=Barbieri:678689] [\cite=Panico:2010ir]. This is enough to implement features like partial compositeness in flat space. In a warped theory these properties would follow automatically from the dual 4D interpretation.

In Appendix [\ref=App5D] we give all the formulas which are necessary to implement our model also on an AdS5 background.

Gauge degrees of freedom

The bulk theory obeys a gauged SO(5)  ×  U(1)X symmetry corresponding to the action

[formula]

The gauge symmetry is broken to SU(2)L  ×  U(1)Y in the UV (z = 0) and to SO(4)  ×  U(1)X in the IR (z = L) by the boundary conditions [\cite=Barbieri:678689]

[formula]

The z = 0 values of the 5D fields are used as interpolating fields (holographic fields) in the low energy theory.

The bulk gauge symmetry has to be gauge fixed. A useful gauge to adopt is the one in which A5 vanishes along the extra dimension. This is reached by a rotation of the gauge fields by the Wilson line

[formula]

where 'P' stands for path ordered exponential and Ta are the SO(5) generators. The issue with [formula] is that it does not reduce to an element of SO(4) on the IR boundary. This problem can be bypassed by enlarging the gauge group at z = L through the explicit introduction of Goldstone bosons. The IR boundary conditions in Eq. [\eqref=gaugeBC] are therefore redefined in terms of the rotated field

[formula]

where U is the matrix in Eq. [\eqref=GB] and

[formula]

This corresponds to an SO(5) gauge transformation by the matrix U. Thanks to the transformation properties of U the IR boundary conditions are now invariant under the full SO(5) group and Eq. [\eqref=holographicgauge] can be used to reach the A5 = 0 gauge. It is important to keep in mind that no new degree of freedom has been introduced in the theory. This is clear since the new scalars in U can be gauge fixed to zero by an appropriate gauge transformation on the IR boundary. The dependence of the IR action on U can be removed through a bulk gauge transformation [formula]. As the bulk action is SO(5) invariant, the effect is merely to move the dependence on U to the UV boundary conditions which become

[formula]

This rotation will affect all the fields in the theory according to their SO(5) representations and determine how the Higgs boson enters the theory.

Localized terms consistent with the reduced gauge symmetry can be added on both boundaries. For the gauge fields we add kinetic terms for the holographic sources

[formula]

Following Ref. [\cite=Panico:2007fq] we obtain the effective action for the holographic degrees of freedom. We solve the classical equations of motion for the bulk fields with the boundary conditions specified in Eq. [\eqref=gaugeBC] and we get

[formula]

The gauge fields can be split into their longitudinal and transverse parts Aμ = A(l)μ + A(t)μ. It is easy to show that the solution of the equation of motion for the longitudinal part is

[formula]

The A5 = 0 gauge is reached by rotating the UV boundary values of the gauge fields as in Eq. [\eqref=holographicgauge1]. The residual gauge freedom can be fixed by going to the Landau gauge B(l)μ = Wa  (l)μ = 0. Now the terms in Eq. [\eqref=Leffgauge] corresponding to the longitudinal part of the broken SO(5) / SO(4) gauge fields deliver the kinetic term for the Goldstone bosons

[formula]

Matching its normalization to Eq. [\eqref=sigmamodel] implies the relation

[formula]

From the remaining part of Eq. [\eqref=Leffgauge] one obtains the form factors appearing in Eq. [\eqref=gaugeFF]

[formula]

where ΠV(p) = p tan pL and Π̂V(p) =  - p cot pL. Using Eqs. ([\ref=gaugeFF]) and ([\ref=gaugeFF1]) we obtain for the gauge couplings

[formula]

which also imply g1  ≈  g', g2  ≈  g and therefore g1  =  g2tW with tW the tangent of the weak mixing angle. The first zero of Πab in Eq. [\eqref=Leffgauge1] corresponds to the W mass. In the limit g2  ≪  g5 this is given by

[formula]

The masses of the Kaluza-Klein resonances can be obtained from the zeros of the form factors. The first KK partner of the W has a mass, before EWSB, given by

[formula]

Also the Ŝ parameter is readily computed from Eq. [\eqref=Leffgauge1]

[formula]

One can interpret Ŝ as originating from the tree level exchange of the massive KK vectors

[formula]

Notice the factor of π2 mismatch between Eqs. [\eqref=shat] and [\eqref=shat2] when Eq. [\eqref=mKK] is used. This is due to the sum over the whole KK tower (M(n)KK  ~  nπ / L) since [formula].

Substituting the form factors in Eqs. ([\ref=gaugeFF]) and ([\ref=gaugeFF1]) into the potential of Eq. [\eqref=CWgauge] and assuming g2  ≪  g5, g1  ≪  gX and g5  ≈  gX we can perform the integral explicitly to get

[formula]

Notice that the gauge contribution to the potential gives a positive mass term for the Higgs and therefore does not break electroweak symmetry [\cite=Witten:1983ut] [\cite=1984NuPhB.234..173V].

Let us now discuss the role of the UV localized kinetic terms for the gauge fields in a flat extra dimension [\cite=Panico:2010ir]. As shown in Eq. [\eqref=gaugecoupling], in the absence of these contributions the kinetic terms of the gauge bosons would come only from the strong sector 1 / g2  ≈  1 / g25. In this case we would expect no difference between the electroweak bosons and the other vector resonances of the theory: this is exemplified by the value of Ŝ which is of order one without UV localized kinetic terms. Such a scenario is clearly not viable. The inclusion of large kinetic terms on the UV boundary is required to ensure that the SM W and Z are sufficiently weakly coupled to the strong sector. The parameter g / g5 can be understood as the degree of mixing between the elementary gauge fields and the composite resonances of the strong dynamics.

When the theory is formulated in AdS5 space the suppression of the mixing between the elementary and the composite sector is guaranteed by the curvature of the metric without the necessity to add localized kinetic terms (see Appendix [\ref=App5D]). The reason for this is the presence of a warping which makes a clear distinction between the UV localized (elementary) and IR localized (composite) states: the small overlap of their wave functions automatically ensures a suppression of their mixing.

Fermionic degrees of freedom

We introduce two bulk Dirac fermions in SO(5)  ×  U(1)X representations: [formula] and [formula]. We work in the massless b quark limit. To properly account for the b quark mass two further multiplets embedding a qL and a tR with X =  - 1 / 3 have to be introduced with appropriate boundary conditions. There is some degree of arbitrariness in the definition of the boundary conditions for the various fermionic components. Our choice is the following

[formula]

where we take the UV boundary values of the T3R  =   - 1 / 2 components of [formula] and of ψtR as holographic fields. Notice that the boundary conditions on the IR brane commute with the unbroken SO(4) symmetry. The two multiplets are assigned the bulk masses MΨt and MΨq respectively so that the bulk action is given by

[formula]

where the factor 1 / L has been introduced to ensure the dimensionality of the 5D fermions to be equivalent to the canonically normalized 4D fields. At this level the only zero modes are a left-handed SU(2)L doublet, qL, and a right-handed SU(2)L singlet, [formula], both coming from Ψq.

The IR boundary terms allowed by the unbroken SO(4)  ×  U(1)X symmetry at x = L are given by the sum of four different kinetic terms for the four SO(4) representations plus a mass mixing between the two SO(4) singlets:

[formula]

The parameter m11 has the dimension of a mass and controls the mixing between the right-handed component of the singlet inside Ψq and the left-handed component of Ψt. This mixing ensures that the holographic source for ψtR has a non vanishing overlap with the right-handed zero mode living in Ψq. This is crucial because the top Yukawa coupling arises from the kinetic term of Ψq after EWSB. The parameters ki are dimensionless and control the magnitude of the IR localized kinetic terms for the four different SO(4) representations. Notice that kt1 and the combination kq1 = kq4 = kq9 are SO(5) invariants. To simplify the discussion and without losing any qualitative effect we set kt1 = kq1 = 0. Non vanishing values for kq4 and kq9 are thus needed to break SO(5) on the IR boundary. Moreover a non vanishing difference kq4 - kq9 is required to break an SU(9 + 4) = SU(13) accidental global symmetry of the bulk theory under which the fields in the [formula] and those in the [formula] rotate as a single multiplet. In the absence of such a breaking the Πq1 form factor would vanish: the only contribution to α in Eq. [\eqref=higgspot] would then come from the gauge sector.

As discussed in the previous section for the gauge sector, realizing partial compositeness in a flat extra dimension requires the introduction of UV localized kinetic terms. We introduce the UV boundary action

[formula]

which contributes to the form factors in Eq. [\eqref=fffermions] as

[formula]

Assuming Zq  ≫  1 implies a hierarchy q0  ≫  Πq1,Πq2 which is the one invoked in Eq. [\eqref=topmass] and above Eq. [\eqref=higgspot]. All interactions of the elementary fields with the strong sector get suppressed by a factor Z- 1 / 2q,t which can be interpreted as the mixing [formula] between elementary and composite fields (see Introduction). In view of Eq. [\eqref=higgsmass], to obtain a composite top right (εR  ≈  1) we take Zt = 0.

The spectrum of fermionic resonances

In this paragraph we review how the spectrum of fermionic resonances is encoded in the holographic action for the boundary degrees of freedom. Using the holographic procedure one can obtain the effective Lagrangian in Fourier space for a fermionic bulk field Ψ

[formula]

The function Π(p) contains all the information about the masses of the physical states in the theory. If the source Ψ is not dynamical (Dirichlet BC in the UV), holography relates [formula] with the two-point function [formula] of the operator OΨ associated to Ψ in the dual 4D picture. This implies that the masses of the physical states are associated with the poles of [formula] (the poles in the two point functions of OΨ). If on the other hand the source Ψ is dynamical, it mixes with the bound states interpolated by OΨ and the masses of the physical states are given by the zeros of [formula]. In the following we will have to deal with cases where Ψ is a vector and Π a matrix. Here three possibilities occur. If all the sources in Ψ are non dynamical it is sufficient to consider the poles of any of the entries in [formula] as all the states with the same quantum numbers in the strong sector are mixed. If all the sources are instead dynamical one has to find the zeros of the various eigenvalues of [formula], that is the zeros of their determinant. Finally, in the intermediate situation in which only a subset of sources is dynamical, it is enough to find the zero eigenvalues of the sub-matrix corresponding to these fields.

For the model presented in this paper, the resonance spectrum before EWSB consists of various towers labeled by their SU(2)L  ×  U(1)Y quantum numbers:

a [formula] tower with masses given by the zeros of [formula];

a [formula] tower with masses given by the zeros of [formula];

a [formula] tower with masses given by the poles of [formula];

a [formula] tower under SO(4), decomposing as [formula] under SU(2)L  ×  U(1)Y with masses given by the poles of [formula].

After EWSB the physical states are organized according to their electric charge:

a charge 2/3 tower with masses given by the zeroes of

[formula]

where the first zero corresponds to the top quark mass;

a charge -1/3 tower with masses given by the zeros of [formula], where the massless pole corresponds to the bottom quark;

a charge 5/3 tower with masses given by the poles of [formula];

charge 8/3 and -4/3 towers with masses given by the poles of [formula].

All the form factors appearing in these expressions are given in Appendix [\ref=App5Dfermions].

Before closing this section it is important to discuss a crucial feature of holographic composite Higgs models, which pertains the relation between the two couplings gρ and gψ described in the Introduction. They can be defined schematically by their relation to the masses of bosonic and fermionic resonances of the theory: [formula] and [formula]. While these two couplings can be split in generic 4D constructions [\cite=Panico:1359049] [\cite=Redi:qi] [\cite=Redi:2012vq], in a 5D theory the Kaluza-Klein masses are all set by a single mass scale, L- 1. For the coupling among vectors, using Eq. [\eqref=mKK] for the mass of the first KK state and Eq. [\eqref=Eq:f], one gets

[formula]

The fermionic spectrum and thus the coupling gψ are more model dependent. Considering a 5D bulk fermion with MΨ = 0 whose right-handed component has ( + , - ) BC we find again

[formula]

Thus in general

[formula]

This has an important consequence in view of Eq. [\eqref=higgsmass] since gψ is now identified with gρ. Barring accidental cancellations in the quartic coupling of the Higgs and assuming the most favorable situation of a composite tR (εR  ~  1), gρ has to be small to accommodate the observed value of mh. This generates a tension with the value of the Ŝ parameter (see Eq. [\eqref=shat])

[formula]

We will come back to this issue in the next Section.

Numerical analysis

In this section we present a numerical analysis of the model focusing on the Higgs potential and on the fermionic spectrum. We begin by discussing the parametric behavior of the various observables we are interested in and later present our numerical procedure.

As we are mainly interested in the composite tR case we first describe the ideal situation in which Zq  ≫  1 and q0  ≈  Zq. The parameters of the 5D model can be related using the expressions for the weak coupling g, the W, top and Higgs masses. The Higgs potential has the following parametric behavior

[formula]

where Vg(h) is the gauge contribution given in Eq. [\eqref=gaugepotential]. pi is the set of dimensionless parameters MqL,  MtL,  m11L,  kt1,  kq1,  kq4,  kq9. If we can neglect Vg (that is if g5 is sufficiently large) the value of ξ can be determined as soon as the pi are fixed. In the limit g5  ≫  g the W mass is given by Eq. [\eqref=wmass]. The top mass can be read off Eq. [\eqref=topmass] and, in the large Zq limit, can be written as

[formula]

where Ft is a dimensionless function of the various pi. Our final input, the Higgs mass, follows from Eq. [\eqref=potentialpar]

[formula]

For a given set of pi it is then possible to fix g5, Zq and L to reproduce the three input values mW, mt and mh.

In order to include the effect of a non vanishing gauge potential and to allow for smaller values of Zq we scan randomly and uniformly over the parameters pi and over both g5 and Zq. For each point we evaluate ξ and compute the ratios mt / mW and mh / mW. We discard points which do not fall into the interval defined by

[formula]

The central value corresponds to the top quark mass renormalized at the scale [formula], [formula]. We choose the following range for the parameters pi

[formula]

To simplify the scan we fix kt1,  kq1 = 0 since these parameters are not expected to modify the qualitative picture as we explained in Section [\ref=sectionfermions]. We furthermore restrict m11 to positive values as it only enters through the combination |m11|2.

In order to conform to the general discussion at the end of Section [\ref=HiggsPotential] it is necessary to understand the typical size of the coefficient a2 defined in Eq. [\eqref=a1a2]. To do so we scan over the range defined by Eq. [\eqref=scanflat] and calculate a2 without imposing any additional requirement. This will give the correct normalization of Eq. [\eqref=a1a2] within our model. The results are shown in Fig. ([\ref=fig:a2prior]). We selected only points in which a2 is negative (the distribution is basically symmetric around 0). The distribution is quite broad but clearly peaks around [formula]. Thus, it is more appropriate to rewrite the NDA estimate of the Higgs mass in Eq. [\eqref=higgsmass] by factoring out the normalization of a2

[formula]

If the constraints that we impose on the parameter space to obtain the correct values for ξ and the top mass do not push a2 to the right tail of its distribution, it is clear that the tension of the model with the Ŝ parameter will be substantially relieved compared to the naive expectation.

Results

In the left panel of Fig. ([\ref=fig:distgrho]) we show the distribution of points passing the various cuts in Eq. [\eqref=passscan] as a function of gρ. The gray histogram includes all points for which mh < 400 GeV, while the red distribution requires mh to fall inside the interval [formula] GeV. As expected from the scaling of mh (see Eqs. ([\ref=higgsmass]) and([\ref=higgsmassprior])), gρ cannot be too large and its distribution is peaked between 3 and 4. In the right panel of Fig. ([\ref=fig:distgrho]) we show the distribution of the parameter [formula] as defined in Eq. [\eqref=higgsmassprior] and compare it with the one already shown in Fig. ([\ref=fig:a2prior]), taking into account the new normalization of |a2|. The scan thus selects values with a2  ~  1, that is in its natural range.

We estimate the tuning of the model as follows. Among all points in which the experimental inputs are reproduced, we pick those satisfying the experimental constraint from the EWPT. These points represent a fraction of the total, and this fraction is what we denote as the tuning of the model. This definition measures the size of the region in parameter space (according to the measure defined by Eq. [\eqref=scanflat]) which is left after the various experimental constraints are imposed. In this way we automatically take into account that unnatural conspiracies among parameters, which are needed to satisfy the experimental constraints, occur rarely [\cite=Strumia:2011by].

Our measure of the tuning differs from the one in Ref. [\cite=Panico:2012vr] where the more common definition in terms of the logarithmic derivative of m2Z with respect to the various parameters was used [\cite=Barbieri:1988p1552].

Requiring the points satisfying Eq. [\eqref=passscan] to be consistent with the LEP electroweak fit at 99% C.L., we remain with the fractions shown in Table [\ref=fracpoints]. In this subset, the value of ξ is always below 0.04, corresponding to f > 1.2 TeV. Notice that the fraction of points remaining (~  5%) is consistent with a measure of the tuning given just by ξ. This is the case because as discussed above we do not need any additional suppression in the Higgs quartic coupling in order to get a light Higgs mass and to cope with the constraints on the Ŝ parameter.

Before moving on we notice that by artificially adding an additional positive contribution to T̂ = 10- 3 the fraction of allowed points grows from 5% to roughly 18% (see the blue histogram in the left panel of Fig. ([\ref=fig:distgrho])). This contribution to T̂, corresponding to one tenth of the top contribution in the SM, is an optimistic estimate of the corrections coming from loops of heavy top partners.

Figure [\ref=fig:points] shows the distribution of points in the (ξ, gρ) plane. We included all points that can be made consistent with EWPT at the 99% C.L. with the assumption of an additional contribution ΔT̂ = 10- 3. Red and orange points have a spectrum which contains a charge 5/3 top partner which is lighter than 800 GeV. Any detailed study of the experimental status of these points is beyond the scope of this work, nevertheless we believe that they should be severely constrained by the available experimental searches [\cite=ATLAS-CONF-2012-130] [\cite=CMS-PAS-SUS-12-027]. The blue contours show the necessary suppression in [formula] according to the NDA estimate of the Higgs boson mass. Fig. ([\ref=fig:points]) is puzzling. If we believe the NDA formula mψ  ~  gρf we should expect a much heavier spectrum than what we find in Fig. [\ref=fig:points], as gρ = 4 and ξ = 0.1 give mψ = 3 TeV!

The solution of this puzzle is shown in Fig. ([\ref=fig:distmasses]). In the left panel we show the fermionic spectrum before EWSB of all points that reproduce the experimental inputs (thicker dots are for points also satisfying EWPT). A definite hierarchy [formula] emerges from the figure. In the right panel of the same figure we compare the mass distribution of the SO(4) representations [formula] (shaded red) and [formula] (shaded blue) before requiring EWPT. The red-dashed histogram shows the distribution of masses obtained from the NDA estimate mψ  ~  gψf. It is clear that, while the singlet matches reasonably well with the expectations, the other three SO(4) representations are much lighter.

To understand this behavior it is necessary to inspect how the top mass is obtained in terms of the model parameters. Using the approximation in Eq. [\eqref=topmass] and the form factors in Eqs. [\eqref=FFAdS], one finds that for large positive MΨq the top mass is exponentially suppressed, while for MΨq < 0

[formula]

Reproducing the correct mt / mW ratio thus fixes [formula]. Next, in the limit of large Zq and vanishing Zt,kq4, kq9, the KK masses of the [formula], [formula] and [formula] towers are all given by the zeros of MΨq  +  ωq cot ωqL while those of the [formula] tower are given by the zeros of MΨt  +  ωt cot ωtL. The approximate expression for the first KK mode mass can be written as

[formula]

We see that since MΨq should be large and negative to reproduce the correct top mass (see Eq. [\eqref=mtconstraint]) we expect the masses of the first resonances in the [formula], [formula], [formula] towers to be parametrically (exponentially) suppressed with respect to the mass of the first KK mode in the [formula] tower, whose corresponding bulk mass MΨt is unconstrained.

We now explain the smaller splittings giving [formula]. First of all, the splitting between the [formula] and the [formula] is proportional to the difference (kq4 - kq9). Expanding the relevant form factors around the point kq4 - kq9 = 0 explicitly shows that [formula] is positive when kq4 - kq9 is positive. Next we rewrite the Higgs potential in Eq. [\eqref=higgspot] separating the fermionic and gauge contributions to α and β:

[formula]

The coefficient αg is negative, βf is always negative in the region we consider, while αf can have both signs depending on k4 - k9. A viable electroweak symmetry breaking requires the coefficient of the s2h term to be negative. The Higgs mass input needs a small g5 which enhances the electroweak symmetry preserving gauge contribution. As the size of β is basically fixed by the top and Higgs mass measurements, EWSB typically requires an extra positive contribution to α (see the minus sign in Eq. [\eqref=higgspot1]), favoring k4  <  k9 and thus [formula].

The mass difference between the [formula] and the [formula] towers is due to the different UV boundary conditions for these fields. The zeros of q0 give the masses of the [formula] while the poles of Πq0 give the masses of the [formula]. It is clear that in the large Zq limit the masses will coincide. In particular, from the explicit form of q0 for kq9 = 0 (see Appendix [\ref=App5Dfermions]),

[formula]

it follows that the states in the [formula] are always heavier than those in the [formula]. A summary of the mass distributions of the fermionic resonances before (red) and after (blue) requiring the electroweak fit at 99% C.L. (with an additional positive contribution ΔT = 10- 3) is given in Figure [\ref=fig:masses]. We show the distributions for the different SO(4) representations [formula] (top left), [formula] (top right), [formula] (bottom left) and [formula] (bottom right).

Outlook and conclusions

The main challenge of composite Higgs models to naturally describe electroweak symmetry breaking are the constraints coming from precision electroweak physics. The tension of these theories with electroweak precision tests is the one of old fashioned Technicolor models and is due to the unavoidable existence of heavy spin-1 states mixing with the SM gauge bosons. This mixing corrects the Ŝ parameter by an amount

[formula]

requiring [formula]  TeV.

The masses of the spin-1 resonances mρ  ~  gρf are controlled by two parameters, their coupling gρ and the decay constant f determining the non-linear interactions of the composite Higgs. As we described in the text, pushing f to large values implies an upper bound on the tuning of the model of order [formula]. Before Higgs discovery, electroweak physics was pointing towards a strongly coupled theory, gρ  ~  4π, and [formula] was needed to regulate the infrared contributions of the composite Higgs to electroweak observables.

The measurement of the Higgs boson mass, mh  ≈  125 GeV, adds extra information to this picture. The generic expectation of the Higgs boson mass in composite Higgs models can be given in terms of the mass of the fermionic resonances which regulate the UV divergence of the Higgs potential:

[formula]

The parameter a2 is naturally expected to be of order 1. In order not to worsen the tuning of the model it is thus important to have light enough fermionic top partners.

In this paper we presented the 5D implementation of a specific class of composite Higgs models with a (pseudo-)Goldstone boson Higgs from the SO(5) / SO(4) coset. Our starting point is the observation, already present in Refs. [\cite=Pomarol:2012vn] [\cite=Panico:2012vr], that in order for ξ to be a good measure of fine tuning and not to underestimate it, the Higgs potential must be the sum of at least two independent periodic functions of the Higgs field h which are generated at the same order in the elementary-composite mixing expansion. This fact constrains the fermionic content of the model. The simplest way to satisfy this requirement is to couple the left-handed top quark to a symmetric representation of SO(5), a 14, and the right-handed top quark to an SO(5) singlet.

Models in 5D are expected to be more constrained and to face a more severe fine tuning problem with respect to more general composite Higgs models. The reason for this are Eqs. [\eqref=outlook:S] and [\eqref=outlook:higgsmass] and the fact that the masses of the fermionic and bosonic resonances are predicted to be parametrically the same, fixed by the size L of the extra dimension. This implies that, once mψ  ~  mρ is fixed to comply with the bound on Ŝ, an additional suppression of either ξ or a2 is needed to obtain the right Higgs mass.

We discussed these issues in our model finding that the NDA estimate in Eq. [\eqref=outlook:higgsmass] may be too pessimistic. In our model this occurs because of an additional, fortuitous, overall suppression of the estimate in Eq. [\eqref=outlook:higgsmass] by a factor ~  0.4  ÷  0.5. The existence of such a suppression implies a somewhat heavier spectrum of the top partners can be obtained without worsening the fine tuning. Our model is somewhat peculiar in this respect because the requirement of a heavy enough top implies that some of the SU(2)L representations, into which the [formula] decomposes, have to be anomalously light. The existence of light, exotic charged, top-partners is probably the most important prediction of the class of composite Higgs models we have been discussing. Their experimental search is to be considered one of the most important avenues to either verify or falsify the composite Higgs idea.

A thorough discussion of the phenomenology of the fermionic sector of our model is beyond the scope of the present work. We will briefly discuss the salient features. The QCD pair production of fermionic color triplets (the top partners) is sizable, ranging (including NLO effects) from 330 (570) fb for a 500 GeV top partner to 1.3 (3.3) fb for a 1 TeV one, at the LHC for 7 (8) TeV center of mass energy. The experimental signatures of the top partners depend strongly on their charge. The most interesting signals arise from the decay of the charge 5/3 (χ) and 8/3 (Υ) fermions. By charge conservation the decay chain of these exotic quarks will involve the emission of up to 3 (for the charge 8/3 top partner) same sign Ws resulting in a final state involving up to 6 W bosons (plus at least 2 b quarks). This results in a sizable fraction of same-sign di-lepton and tri-lepton events.

In our model, and in all constructions where the Higgs is a PGB from SO(5) / SO(4), the fermionic resonances fill degenerate SO(4) multiplets before EWSB and in the absence of elementary-composite mixing. In our model the lightest among these SO(4) representations is a [formula] which decomposes under SU(2)L  ×  U(1)Y as [formula]. This SO(4) multiplet contains, in particular, two charge 5/3 and a charge 8/3 quarks. A rough estimate of the current experimental bounds can be inferred from the analysis of Ref. [\cite=CMS-PAS-B2G-12-012] looking for same-sign di-leptons in a sample of 19.6 fb- 1 from the 8 TeV LHC run. In the analysis the SM is extended by the addition of a single charge 5/3 Dirac fermion decaying with unit brancing ratio into W+t. A 95% C.L. lower bound of 770 GeV is set on the mass of the fermion. The actual bound will be stronger in our model. Neglecting the other fermionic states in the 9 and the other SO(4) multiplets, we still have two charge 5/3 and one charge 8/3 quarks. The pair production of the charge 5/3 fermions will give rise to same-sign di-leptons with a branching ratio of 4.5% and to tri-leptons with a branching ratio of 3%. In the case of the charge 8/3 quark it is necessary to keep in mind that the decay Υ  →  χW+ cannot proceed through a on-shell W because Υ and χ are exactly degenerate at tree level as they do not mix with the elementary states. Their splitting is induced by electroweak effects at 1-loop and is of order 200 MeV [\cite=Cirelli:2005br]. To understand the signatures arising form Υ pair production one has to compare the following three-body decay channels: Υ  →  π+χ or Υ  →  νχ through an off-shell W boson and Υ  →  W+W+t through an off-shell χ. The two former decay widths are proportional to GFf2πΔM3 and GFΔM5 respectively, while the latter is proportional to M and thus expected to be dominant. This implies that the typical final state arising from Υ pair production will contain three opposite sign W boson pairs and two b quarks. This final state will decay to same-sign di-leptons 6% of the times and to tri-leptons 6.5% of the times. Even with this naive approach we expect more than a threefold increase in di-lepton signal rates with respect to those assumed in Ref. [\cite=CMS-PAS-B2G-12-012] and a correspondingly stronger bound on the mass of the fermions.

Since a generic feature of our model is the existence of an SO(4) multiplet of top partners, the 9, which is parametrically lighter than the others, the appropriate way to describe its phenomenology is along the lines of Ref. [\cite=DeSimone:2012ul]. We are aware of a group working in this direction [\cite=MatsedonskyiToAppear].

An orthogonal experimental avenue to follow in generic composite Higgs models is the search for bosonic vector resonances, that is excited W, Z bosons and excited gluons. For this we refer the reader to the existing literature [\cite=Giudice:1024017] [\cite=Falkowski:2011ua] [\cite=Bini:2011zb].

Finally, as in every composite Higgs model, the Higgs couplings to SM gauge bosons and fermions are modified. From this point of view our model is indistinguishable from other known composite Higgs models as the one described in [\cite=Agashe:2005p372]. Deviations from the SM are controlled by a single parameter, ξ. Bounds on ξ coming from Higgs coupling measurements are currently mild, requiring ξ < 0.3  ÷  0.4 [\cite=Falkowski:2013dza].

SO(5) generators

A basis for the generators in the fundamental representation of the SO(5) algebra is given by

[formula]

where [formula], while [formula] and a  =  1,2,3. The generators {TaR,L} and [formula] represent the [formula] and the SO(5) / SO(4) subspaces of SO(5) respectively.

5D implementation in AdS5 space

In this Appendix we describe the implementation of the MCHM14 in AdS5 space and illustrate some details about the flat space construction which were not discussed in the text. We consider a 5D space-time with metric

[formula]

where the coordinate z varies on the interval

[formula]

Gauge degrees of freedom

The Lagrangian for the gauge fields in terms of the general metric of Eq. [\eqref=geom1] is given by

[formula]

where L0 has the dimensions of length and is equal to L in flat space and to 1 / k in AdS5. We also add a UV localized term exactly as in Eq. [\eqref=gauge5D2]. To derive the effective Lagrangian in AdS5, we can follow the same procedure as discussed in Section [\ref=App5Dgauge]. The whole difference with respect to flat space is encoded in the two form factors ΠV and Π̂V which read in AdS5

[formula]

The Higgs decay constant in this case is given by

[formula]

where, in the last step, we assumed zIR  ≫  zUV. In the same limit the SM gauge couplings can be written as

[formula]

where we approximated [formula]. In the same limit the W boson mass is given by

[formula]

The KK mass scale (looking for instance at the W boson tower) is

[formula]

and the Ŝ parameter is

[formula]

Note that the inclusion of UV localized kinetic terms for the gauge fields is not strictly necessary to realize partial compositeness in AdS5 space. The value of g2 and g1 may be interpreted as the strength of the gauge coupling at the scale k [\cite=Agashe:2002fu]: when the localized kinetic terms vanish, the gauge fields are strongly coupled at that scale.

Fermionic degrees of freedom

Here we discuss various details about the fermionic sector of the model both in AdS5 and flat space. The expression of Ψq in terms of eigenstates of the SM quantum numbers is

[formula]

where the fields t(i), b(i), χ(i), ζ and Υ have charges 2 / 3, - 1 / 3, 5 / 3, - 4 / 3, 8 / 3 respectively and

[formula]

The total 5D action for the fermionic sector of the model is given by

[formula]

where

[formula]

L0 is a length we use to normalize the bulk action in order to have 5D fermions with the same mass dimension as 4D fermions. As in the case of the gauge action it is equal to L in flat space and to 1 / k in AdS5. gIR and gUV are the induced metrics on the IR and UV boundaries respectively. eMA is the fünfbein and eμa its projection on the 4D indices. It is given by δMA / a(z) for flat and AdS5 metric. Covariant derivatives in Sf5D include both gauge and spin connections. The latter cancel out in the equations of motion. In flat space we also add localized kinetic terms on the UV boundary, as in Eq. [\eqref=UVfermions], to properly implement partial compositeness.

The bulk equations of motion corresponding to Eq. [\eqref=5Dtotalaction] are

[formula]

These are supplemented by the following boundary conditions:

UV boundary conditions

[formula]

with Ψ0qL given by Eq. [\eqref=complete14] where all the fields but t1 = tL and b1 = bL are set to zero while [formula] is free to vary and

[formula]

with Ψ0tR = tR and [formula] free to vary.

IR boundary conditions

[formula]

where, without loss of generality, we have set kq1 = kt1 = 0.

The U transformation in the ΨqL UV boundary condition has been introduced to take the SO(5) transformation in Eq. [\eqref=holographicgauge1] into account, needed to rotate the Higgs (A5) away from the bulk and the IR boundary. The SM quantum numbers and the boundary conditions for all fermionic fields of the 5D model are summarized in Table [\ref=Table1].

Solving the bulk equations of motion [\eqref=eom1] with the boundary conditions above, integrating out the bulk fields and matching to the 4D effective action [\eqref=efflag14] gives the form factors as functions of the fermion bulk-to-boundary propagators [formula] and [formula], which are functions of the metric gμν. Defining ω2q,t = p2 - m2q,t in flat space and ωq  =  2 / (πzUV) and ωt  =  2 / (πzIR) in AdS5 the form factors can be written in the form The bulk-to-boundary propagators [formula] and [formula] are given by the following expressions:

Flat space (zIR = L)

[formula]

AdS5

[formula]

As the propagators appear only as functions of zUV in Eq. [\eqref=FFAdS], for clarity we have absorbed a factor of z5 / 2, originating from the G, inside ωq,t.

The electroweak fit

We use the following experimental determination of the Ŝ and T̂ parameters

[formula]

with the corresponding correlation matrix

[formula]

The resulting χ2 function is given by

[formula]

[formula]

The contributions to Ŝ and T̂ in our model are estimated by

[formula]

where Λ is the scale at which the logs are cut off. We fix Λ to be the mass of the first vector KK resonance. Ŝ and T̂ are defined to vanish for a SM Higgs boson with [formula].
