Introduction

In General Relativity (GR) stationary black holes, which are the endpoint of gravitational collapse, must be axisymmetric and are described by the Kerr-Newman metric[\cite=Hawking72b]. The prototypical alternative theory of gravity is Brans-Dicke theory with (Jordan frame) action

[formula]

In 1972 Hawking showed that stationary black holes in this theory must be the Kerr-Newman black holes of GR[\cite=Hawking72]. This result was generalized by Bekenstein to more general scalar-tensor theories, but with the additional assumption of spherical symmetry[\cite=Bekenstein96]. Hawking's result has recently been extended to general scalar-tensor theories with action

[formula]

without any extra assumption of symmetry apart from stationarity[\cite=PRL]. This proof is presented below.

The proof

To begin with, we require:

Asymptotic flatness: this requires V(φ0) = 0 and φ0  V'(φ0) = 2V(φ0), where φ0 is the value the Brans-Dicke scalar field approaches as r  →    +    ∞   (gravitational collapse occurs on scales much smaller than the Hubble scale H- 10, so asymptotic flatness is expected to be an adequate approximation physically).

Stationarity: the black hole is supposed to be the endpoint of collapse.

We map the theory to the Einstein conformal frame according to ĝμν  →  gμν  =  φ  ĝμν, φ  →  φ, with [formula] (for ω  ≠   - 3 / 2). The action becomes

[formula]

where U(φ) = V(φ) / φ2. The field equation for the scalar in vacuo in the Einstein frame is

[formula]

Since the conformal factor of the transformation depends only on the Brans-Dicke field φ, the Einstein frame symmetries are the same as in the Jordan frame. In particular, there exists a Killing vector ξμ which is timelike at infinity (stationarity). In the Einstein frame and in electrovacuum the theory is essentially GR with a minimally coupled scalar field. So, stationary, asymptotically flat black holes have to be axisymmetric and, hence, there should be a second Killing vector ζμ which is spacelike at infinity, provided that the stress-energy tensor for φ satisfies the weak energy condition[\cite=Hawking72b]. Consider, in vacuo, a 4-volume V bounded by the horizon H, two partial Cauchy hypersurfaces S1, S2, and a timelike 3-surface at infinity. Now multiply both sides of eq. ([\ref=scalar]) by U' and integrate over the 4-volume V, obtaining

[formula]

We can rewrite this equation as

[formula]

where nμ is the normal to the boundary and h is the determinant of the induced metric hμν on this boundary. Splitting the boundary into its constituent parts one has [formula],

[formula]

because of the spacetime symmetries, and [formula] if S2 is obtained by shifting each point of S1 along integral curves of ξμ, hence

[formula]

U'2  ≥  0, [formula] (which is orthogonal to both ξμ and ζμ) is spacelike or zero, and with U''(φ)  ≥  0 being a local stability condition, one concludes that it must be [formula] in V and U'(φ0) = 0. But for φ  =  const., to which we have reduced, the scalar-tensor theory reduces to GR and the black hole must be described by the Kerr metric.

Metric f(R) gravity, which has seen much recent attention[\cite=Sotiriou:2008rp] [\cite=review2], is a special Brans-Dicke theory with parameter ω = 0 and a non-trivial potential V for the Brans-Dicke field φ = f'(R). Palatini f(R) gravity, instead, corresponds to an ω =  - 3 / 2 Brans-Dicke theory (again, with a potential). The case ω =  - 3 / 2 was explicitly excluded in our discussion but ω =  - 3 / 2 Brans-Dicke theory reduces to GR in vacuo anyway.

Conclusions

The proof presented above extends immediately to electro-vacuum and to any form of conformal matter with trace of the energy-momentum tensor T = 0. It implies that asymptotically flat black holes that are the endpoint of collapse in scalar-tensor gravity are described by the Kerr-Newman metric. The assumption of asymptotic flatness is a limitation mathematically, but one expects on physical grounds that the effect of a Friedmann-Lematre-Robertson-Walker asymptotic structure on astrophysical collapse to be completely negligible (except for primordial black holes for which the collapse and the Hubble scales can be comparable[\cite=Jacobson:1999vr]).

There are certain exceptions to the proof, which include: (i) theories in which ω  →    ∞   somewhere outside or on the horizon; (ii) theories in which φ  →    ∞   or φ  →  0 somewhere outside or on the horizon; (iii) theories in which the stress-energy tensor of the Einstein-frame scalar violates the weak energy condition.

It is likely that the majority of these exceptional theories or solutions will be unphysical ( e.g., the gravitational coupling in scalar-tensor gravity is inversely proportional to φ) but interesting exceptions might exist. This issue will be addressed in future work.
