Generalization of Weak Amenability of group Algebras

Introduction

Suppose that X is a Banach A-bimodule. A derivation D:A  →  X is a linear map which satisfies D(ab) = a.D(b) + D(a).b for all a,b∈A.

The derivation δ is said to be inner if there exists x∈X such that δ(a) = δx(a) = a.x - x.a for all a∈A. The linear space of bounded derivations from A into X denoted by Z1(A,X) and the linear subspace of inner derivations denoted by N1(A,X). We consider the quotient space H1(A,X) = Z1(A,X) / N1(A,X), called the first Hochschild cohomology group of A with coefficients in X.

A Banach algebra A is amenable if every derivation from A into every dual Banach A-module is inner, equivalently if H1(A,X*) = {0} for every Banach A-module X, this definition was introduced by Johnson in [\cite=jo1]. One of the important things that Johnson proved is that the group algebra L1(G) is amenable if and only if G is amenable, where G is locally compact group.

A Banach algebra A is called weakly amenable if, H1(A,A*) = {0} (for more details see [\cite=Ba] and [\cite=gr]). Let A be Banach algebra and let φ and ψ be continuous homomorphisms on A. We consider the following module actions on A,

[formula]

We denote the above A-module by A(φ,ψ).

Let X be an A-module. A bounded linear mapping d:A  →  X is called a (φ,ψ)-derivation if

[formula]

A bounded linear mapping d:A  →  X is called a (φ,ψ)-inner derivation if there exists x∈X such that

[formula]

Throughout, unless otherwise stated, by a (φ,ψ)-derivation we means that a continuous (φ,ψ)-derivation. New notion of weak amenability of Banach algebras, (φ,ψ)-weak amenability, introduced in [\cite=go], where the authors determined the relations between weak amenability and (φ,ψ)-weak amenability of Banach algebras.

Let A be a Banach algebra and let φ and ψ be continuous homomorphisms on A. Then A is called (φ,ψ)-weakly amenable if H1(A,(A(φ,ψ))*) = {0}.

Let A and B be Banach algebras. Similarly to [\cite=go], we denote by Hom(A,B) the metric space of all bounded homomorphisms from A into B, with the metric derived from the usual linear operator norm [formula] on B(A,B) and denote Hom(A,A) by Hom(A), where B(A,B) is the set of all bounded linear operators from A into B.

Let A be a Banach algebra, X be a Banach A-module and let φ,ψ∈Hom(A). A derivation D:A  →  X is called approximately (φ,ψ)-inner if there exists a net (xα) in X such that, for all a∈A, D(a) =  lim αxα  ·  φ(a) - ψ(a)  ·  xα in norm. A Banach algebra A is approximately (φ,ψ)-weakly amenable if every derivation D:A  →  (A(φ,ψ))* is approximately (φ,ψ)-inner.

In this work we study (φ,ψ)-weak amenability of Banach algebras. In section 2, we prove when the group algebra L1(G) is a two-sided G-module then it is (φ,ψ)-amenable. Also we consider the measure algebra M(G), if M(G) is (φ,ψ)-weakly amenable, then G is discrete and amenable. In section 3, we investigate (φ,ψ)-weak amenability of Segal algebras and abstract Segal algebras. At first, we consider approximate (φ,ψ)-derivation from Segal algebra S1(G) into its dual, and after that we study commutative abstract Segal algebras.

(φ,ψ)-weak Amenability

In this section, by providing some new results in (φ,ψ)-weak amenability of Banach algebras, we study (φ,ψ)-weak amenability of group algebra L1(G) where φ,ψ∈Hom(L1(G)) and G is locally compact group.

Let A be a Banach algebra, B be a Banach A-bimodule, Φ:A  →  B be a multiplier with dense range, and d:A  →  (B(φ,ψ))* be a non-zero (φ,ψ)-derivation where φ,ψ∈Hom(A). Then [formula] is a non-zero (φ,ψ)-derivation.

For every x,y,z∈A we have

[formula]

Therefore D is a (φ,ψ)-derivation. If D = 0, then for every x,y∈A we have 〈D(x),y〉 = 0. Then [formula]. This means that d(A) = 0, and so d = 0.

Let A be a Banach algebra, B be a closed subalgebra, and I be an closed ideal of A such that [formula]. If A is (φ,ψ)-weakly amenable, where φ,ψ∈Hom(A) and φ(B),ψ(B)  ⊆  B, then B is (φ,ψ)-weakly amenable.

Let π:A  →  B be the natural projection from A onto B. Then π is a multiplier on B. Also, for every a,b∈A, there are x,y∈B such that a = x + I and b = y + I, then π(ab) = xy = xπ(b) = π(a)y.

Suppose that d:B  →  (B(φ,ψ))* is an arbitrary (φ,ψ)-derivation. From Proposition [\ref=2.1], [formula] is a (φ,ψ)-derivation. Since A is (φ,ψ)-weakly amenable, then there exists an element ξ∈A* such that

[formula]

Set η  =  ξ|B. Then

[formula]

for every x,y∈B (note that B is a closed subalgebra of A). Then d is a (φ,ψ)-inner derivation.

Let G be a nondiscrete locally compact group. Then [formula] is the direct sum decomposition of the measure algebra M(G) into its closed subalgebra of discrete measure Md(G) and its closed ideal of continuous measures Mc(G) (Theorem 19.20 of [\cite=he]).

Let M(G) be (φ,ψ)-weakly amenable, where φ,ψ∈Hom(M(G)), such that φ(Md(G)),ψ(Md(G))  ⊆  Md(G). Then Md(G) is (φ,ψ)-weakly amenable.

In [\cite=de], Dales, Ghahramani and Helemskii showed that M(G) is weakly amenable if and only if G is discrete if and only if there is no non-zero, continuous point derivation at a character of M(G).

Similarly, let φ∈Hom(M(G)), and is onto. If M(G) is (φ,φ)-weakly amenable and 0  ≠  ψ∈Δ(M(G)), then by Theorem 2.10 of [\cite=go], there are no non-zero point derivation at [formula]. This means that G is discrete and M(G) is weakly amenable. Converse of this statement is true, when φ and ψ are identity homomorphisms. This shows that the space of this new notion is wider then weak amenable Banach algebras.

Let X be a Banach space, a net (mα)  ⊂  X* called converges weak~ to m∈X* if [formula] and [formula], this notion introduced in [\cite=l1]. In particular case, if μ∈M(G), suppose that ν∈L∞(G)* is a norm preserving extension of μ. Then there exists a net (fγ)  ⊂  L1(G) with [formula], and [formula]. By passing to a suitable subnet we can write [formula], so we have fγ  →μ weak~. Let A be a Banach algebra, for operator φ, we say that φ satisfies in weak~ condition if for every net (mα)  ⊂  A* which converges weak~ to m∈A*, then [formula].

Let G be a locally compact group, and X be a M(G)-bimodule by module actions [formula] and [formula] where φ,ψ∈Hom(L1(G)), and [formula] are extensions of φ and ψ. Then every (φ,ψ)-derivation D:L1(G)  →  X* extends to a unique [formula]-derivation form M(G) into X*.

Let μ∈M(G), take a net (fγ)  ⊂  L1(G) such that fγ  →  μ weak~. Then the net (Dfγ) converges in w*-topology. Define [formula]. Thus [formula] is a bounded linear operator which extend D. For every x∈X, g1,g2∈L1(G) and μ∈M(G) we have

[formula]

Now, we show that [formula] is a [formula]-derivation. As above suppose that fγ  →  μ weak~, then by [\ref=11], we have

[formula]

for every η∈M(G),g∈L1(G), and x∈X (note that [formula] and L1(G).X = X). For uniqueness of [formula], let D' be other [formula]-derivation which extend D to M(G). Let fγ and μ be as above, then [formula].

Let G be a locally compact group. A Banach space X called G-module if the following statements hold

there is [formula] such that [formula] for every g∈G,x∈X;

for x∈X, the map G  →  X:g  ↦  g.x is continuous.

Similarly for right Banach G-modules, and two-sided Banach G-modules, where in the latter case we require the map G  ×  G  →  X:(g1,g2)  ↦  g1.x.g2 to be continuous. If X* is the dual of X then by following actions, X* is two-sided G-module:

[formula]

for every θ∈G,x∈X and f∈X*.

Weak amenability of L1(G) studied by Johnson in [\cite=jo2], and after he, Despi and Ghahramani in [\cite=de] (Theorem 1) gave different proof for weak amenability of L1(G). We use technique of proof in [\cite=de], and we have the following Theorem.

Let L1(G) be two-sided G-module, and φ,ψ∈Hom(L1(G)). Then L1(G) is (φ,ψ)-weak amenable.

Let D:L1(G)  →  L∞(G) be a (φ,ψ)-derivation. By Theorem [\ref=de], it suffices to show extending of D on M(G) is inner. For t∈G, by δt, we mean that the point mass at t. Then

[formula]

For every λ∈L∞(G), let Re(λ) denote the real part of λ, and let

[formula]

Take ξ  =   sup (S). Since L1(G) is two-sided G-module, then we have

[formula]

Now by [\ref=2.4] and [\ref=2.5], we have

[formula]

then

[formula]

for every x∈G. Similarly for imaginary part, there exists an element ζ∈L∞(G) such that

[formula]

for every x∈G. Therefore by taking ς  =  ξ + iζ we have

[formula]

for every x∈G. Let μ∈M(G), then there exists a net (μα) with each μα a linear combination of point masses such that μα  →  μ in strong topology (note that point masses are extreme point of M(G)). Also we can give this net such as net in proof of Theorem [\ref=de]. Then

[formula]

for every μ∈M(G). This means that L1(G) is (φ,ψ)-weak amenable.

Results For Segal Algebras

Let [formula] be a Banach algebra. Then [formula] is an abstract Segal algebra with respect to [formula] if:

(1) [formula] is a dense left ideal in A and [formula] is a Banach algebra with respect to [formula];

(2) There exists M > 0 such that [formula], for each [formula];

(3) There exists C > 0 such that [formula], for each [formula].

Let G be a locally compact group. A linear subspace S1(G) of L1(G) is said to be a Segal algebra, if it satisfies the following conditions:

(i) S1(G) is a dense in L1(G);

(ii) If f∈S1(G), then Lxf∈S1(G), i.e. S1(G) is left translation invariant;

(iii) S1(G) is a Banach space under some norm [formula] and [formula], for all f∈S1(G) and x∈G;

(iv) Map x  ↦  Lxf from G into S1(G) is continuous.

For more details about Segal algebras see [\cite=ri]. Dales and Pandey studied Weak amenability of special case of Segal algebras in [\cite=da1], and after they, Weak amenability of Segal algebras and Lebesgue-Fourier algebra of a locally compact group improved by Ghaharamani and Lau in [\cite=gh1].

Let G be an amenable group and let S1(G) be a symmetric Segal algebra with approximate identity (eα)α contained in center of L1(G). Give φ,ψ∈Hom(S1(G)) such that extensions of φ,ψ on L1(G) are continuous, and ψ is onto. Then every bounded (φ,ψ)-derivation from S1(G) into S1(G)* is approximately (φ,ψ)-inner.

Let (eα)α be an approximate identity of S1(G) contained in the center of L1(G), and let [formula] and [formula] be extensions of φ and ψ on L1(G).

For each α, define Dα:L1(G)  →  S1(G)* by [formula], for every f∈L1(G). At first we show that Dα is a bounded (φ,ψ)-derivation. Boundedness of Dα comes from that L1(G) acts continuously on S1(G) on the right, and so [formula] is continuous from L1(G) into S1(G)*. Similarly L1(G) acts continuously on S1(G) on the left, and so [formula], therefore Dα is continuous.

Now, we should show that Dα is a (φ,ψ)-derivation. Let f1,f2∈L1(G), then

[formula]

Therefore Dα is a (φ,ψ)-derivation. By Johnson Theorem there exists ξα in S1(G)* such that

[formula]

for every f∈L1(G), and we have

[formula]

for every f∈S1(G). Then

[formula]

If we take f = eα, since (eα) is in the center of L1(G), then D(eα) = 0. There for every f∈S1(G), we have

[formula]

and so proof is complete.

Let A be a commutative Banach algebra, and let [formula] be an abstract Segal algebra of A with approximate identity (eα). Suppose that [formula], with continuous extension [formula] on A. If A is [formula]-weakly amenable, then [formula] is (φ,φ)-weakly amenable.

Let [formula] be a continuous (φ,φ)-derivation. Similarly to proof of Theorem [\ref=1], define [formula] by [formula], for every f∈A. According to the proof of Theorem [\ref=1], Dα is a continuous (φ,φ)-derivation. Since A is [formula]-weakly amenable and commutative, therefore [formula] is a symmetric A-bimodule. These mean that Dα = 0, and this means that D = 0.
