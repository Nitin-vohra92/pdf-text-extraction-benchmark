Introduction

Throughout the paper the term "group" we always use in the meaning "finite group". We use symbols A  ≤  G and [formula] if A is a subgroup of G and A is a normal subgroup of G respectively. If Ω is a (finite) set, then by [formula] we denote the group of all permutations of Ω. We also denote [formula] by [formula]. Given H  ≤  G by [formula] we denote the kernel of H.

Assume that G acts on Ω. An element x∈Ω is called a G-regular point, if |xG|  =  |G|, i.e., if the stabilizer of x is trivial. We define the action of G on Ωk by If G acts faithfully and transitively on Ω, then the minimal k such that Ωk possesses a G-regular point is called the base size of G and is denoted by [formula]. For every natural m the number of G-regular orbits on Ωm is denoted by [formula] (this number equals 0 if [formula]). If H is a subgroup of G and G acts on the set Ω of right cosets of H by right multiplications, then G / HG acts faithfully and transitively on Ω. In this case we denote [formula] and [formula] by [formula] and [formula] respectively. We also say that [formula] is the base size of G with respect to H. Clearly, [formula] is the minimal k such that there exist elements [formula] with [formula]. Thus, the base size of G with respect to H is the minimal k such that there exist k conjugates of H with intersection equals HG.

We prove the following theorem in the paper.

The following results were obtained in this direction. In 1966 D.S.Passman proved (see [\cite=Pass]) that a p-solvable group possesses three Sylow p-subgroups whose intersection equals the p-radical of G. Later in 1996 V.I.Zenkov proved (see [\cite=Zen1]) that the same conclusion holds for arbitrary finite group G. In [\cite=Dolfi] S.Dolfi proved that in every π-solvable group G there exist three conjugate π-Hall subgroups whose intersection equals Oπ(G) (see also [\cite=VdovinIntersSolv]). Notice also that V.I.Zenkov in [\cite=Zen2] constructed an example of a group G possessing a solvable π-Hall subgroup H such that the intersection of five conjugates of H equals Oπ(G), while the intersection of every four conjugates of H is greater than Oπ(G). In [\cite=VdovinZenkov] the following statement is proven.

Moreover, at the beginning of the proof of Theorem 2 from [\cite=VdovinZenkov] the following statement is obtained.

If, for a group G and its subgroup H, the inequality [formula] holds, then [formula].

Thus by Theorems [\ref=IntersectSimple] and [\ref=Vdo-Zen-main], Lemma [\ref=BoundReg], and [\cite=VdovinZenkov] we immediately obtain

Notations and preliminary results

Throughout by π a set of primes is denoted, while by π' we denote its complement in the set of all primes. A subgroup H of G is called a π-Hall subgroup, if the order |H| is divisible by primes from π only, while its index |G:H| is divisible by primes from π' only. The set of all π-Hall subgroups of G is denoted by [formula]. A subgroup H of G is called a Hall subgroup, if its order |H| and the index |G:H| are coprime. A group G is called almost simple, if there exists a nonabelian simple group S such that [formula], where [formula] is the generalized Fitting subgroup of G. In other words, G is called almost simple, if there exists a simple group S such that [formula].

Let G be a finite group and A be its normal subgroup. If [formula], then [formula] and [formula].

Let A be an abelian subgroup of a finite group G. Then there exists x∈G such that [formula].

Combining known results (see [\cite=VdoRevUspehi]), we obtain the following

Let G be a simple group of Lie type over a field of characteristic p∈π and H be its solvable π-Hall subgroup. Then either H is included in a Borel subgroup of G, or one of the following holds:

G = SL3(2) or G = SL3(3) and H is the stabilizer of a line or of a plain in the natural 3-dimensional module, i.e., there exist two classes of conjugate π-Hall subgroups in this case.

G = SL4(2) or G = PSL4(3) and H is the stabilizer of a two-dimensional subspace of the natural 4-dimensional module.

G = SL5(2) or G = SL5(3) and H is the stabilizer of a chain of subspaces V0 < V1 < V2 < V3 = V whose codimensions are in the set {1,2} (i.e. two codimensions equal 2 and one codimension equals 1). There exist three classes of conjugate π-Hall subgroups in this case.

We recall some known technical results (see [\cite=BurLieSha]). If G acts transitively on the set Ω, then given x∈G by [formula] we denote the fixed point ratio of x, i.e. [formula], where [formula]. If G acts transitively and H is a point stabilizer, then the following formulae is known

[formula]

As it is noted in [\cite=LieSha], the base size can be bounded by using the following arguments. Assume that G acts faithfully and let Q(G,c) denote the probability that arbitrary chosen element of Ωc is not a G-regular point. Clearly, [formula] is the minimal c such that Q(G,c) < 1. In particular, if Q(G,c) < 1 then [formula]. Clearly, an element of Ωc is not a G-regular point if and only if it is stable under the action of an element x of prime order. Notice also that the probability for arbitrary chosen element of Ωc to be stable under x is not greater than [formula]. Denote by P the set of elements of G whose order is equal to a prime number. Let [formula] be representatives of the conjugacy classes of elements from P. Since G acts transitively, the formulae [\eqref=fpr] shows that [formula] does not depend on the choice of the representative of a conjugacy class. Thus the following chain of inequalities holds.

[formula]

In particular, we can use the upper bound for [formula] in order to bound (G,c) and so to bound Q(G,c). The following lemma is the main technical tool for this bound.

[\cite=BurLieSha] Let G be a transitive group of permutations on Ω and H be a point stabilizer. Assume that [formula] are representatives of distinct conjugacy classes such that the inequalities [formula] and [formula] hold for all [formula]. Then the inequality holds for every [formula].

Notice that for every subgroup H and every set [formula] not containing the identity element the bound [formula] holds.

Technical results

Our notations for groups of Lie type agree with that of [\cite=GorLySol]. In particular, for every simple group of Lie type S over a field of characteristic p we fix a simple algebraic group [formula] of adjoint type and a Steinberg map σ so that [formula]. Then [formula] is the group of inner-diagonal automorphisms of S (we denote the group of inner-diagonal automorphisms of S by Ŝ). We assume that a Borel [formula] and its maximal torus [formula] are chosen σ-invariant, and we denote [formula] and [formula] by B and T respectively. Recall that if [formula], then the definition field of S equals [formula], if [formula], then the definition field of S equals [formula], and the definition field of S equals [formula] in the remaining cases. For groups [formula] we also use the notations A-n(q),D-n(q),E-6(q) respectively. Notice also the known fact: [formula] (= 1, if [formula] is of adjoint type) and [formula] (= 1, if [formula] is of adjoint type).

Let G be a group of inner-diagonal automorphisms of a finite simple group of Lie type over a field of characteristic p (i.e. [formula] for some connected simple algebraic group [formula] of adjoint type over an algebraically closed field of characteristic p and a Steinberg map σ). Let [formula] be a Borel subgroup of G, where U is a maximal unipotent subgroup of G and T is a Cartan subgroup of G. We denote the subgroup of monomial matrices containing T by N so that N / T≃W is the Weyl group of G. Let w0∈W be the unique element that maps all positive roots into negatives, and n0 be its preimage in N. Then there exists x∈Un0 such that [formula]. In particular, there exist u,v∈Op'(G) such that [formula].

Consider [formula]. The Fitting subgroup [formula] equals Un0 since Z(Op'(G)) = 1. Otherwise, since Un0 is a normal nilpotent subgroup of [formula] we obtain that [formula]. If [formula], then there exists 1  ≠  z∈T centralizing Un0 and so lying in Z(Op'(G)) = 1, a contradiction. Hence [formula] and by Lemma [\ref=ZenkovAbelian] there exists x∈Un0 such that [formula].

Notice that [formula], so [formula]. Since [formula] we obtain

[formula]

whence the main statement of the lemma follows.

Now we prove "in particular", i.e., we show that there exist u,v∈Op'(G) such that [formula]. By construction, x∈Un0  ≤  Op'(G) and [formula]. The lemma is proven.

Let [formula] be a finite simple nontwisted group of Lie type over a field [formula] of characteristic p. A Cartan subgroup [formula] of S can be obtained as [formula] (see [\cite=GorLySol]), where Π is a set of fundamental roots of the root system of S. Then a field automorphism φ of S can be chosen so that for every r∈Π, [formula] the identity hr(λ)φ = hr(λp) holds. Moreover, a graph automorphism τ corresponding to the symmetry [formula] of the Dynkin diagram of S can be chosen so that for every r∈Π, [formula] the identity [formula] holds, where λ̄  =  λ, if all roots have the same length. Consider the subgroup A generated by so chosen field automorphism and graph automorphisms (there exist several graph automorphisms for the root system D4). It is well-known that [formula]. Moreover, A normalizes a Borel subgroup B containing the Cartan subgroup T. Since NŜ(B) = B we obtain that [formula].

Now assume that S is a finite simple twisted group of Lie type distinct from a Suzuki group or a Ree group, L is a nontwisted group of Lie type and ψ is an automorphism of L such that S = Op'(Lψ). Let [formula] be the symmetry of the Dynkin diagram of a fundamental set of roots Π of the root system of L using for construction of ψ. Then a Cartan subgroup [formula] of L̂ can be written as [formula], and a field automorphism φ of S can be chosen so that for every r∈Π, [formula] the equality [formula] holds. We set A = 〈φ〉, then [formula], and there exists a Borel subgroup B of Ŝ such that the equality [formula] holds.

In the introduced notations assume that, if S is not twisted, then the order q of the definition field [formula] of S is greater than 2. Moreover, if S = D4(q), assume also that q > 3. Assume also that S is neither a Suzuki group nor a Ree group. Then there exists [formula] such that CA(x) = 1. In particular [formula].

If S is not twisted and is distinct from D4(q), then we can take x = hr(λ), where r∈Π is such that [formula] and λ is a generating element of the multiplicative group of [formula]. If S is twisted distinct from [formula], then we can take [formula], where λ is a generating element of the multiplicative group of [formula] and [formula]. If [formula], then we can take [formula], where λ is a generating element of the multiplicative group of [formula] and [formula]. Finally, if S = D4(q) and q > 3, then there exist [formula] such that [formula] and λ1 generates [formula]. Choose fundamental roots r,s so that there exists a nontrivial symmetry of the Dynkin diagram, permuting the roots. Then we can take x = hr(λ1)hs(λ2).

Let G be an almost simple group, whose simple socle S is a group of Lie type, satisfying the conditions of Lemma [\ref=IntersectionOutBorel]. Let [formula] be a Borel subgroup of Ŝ and H = NG(B). Then there exist x,y,z∈S, such that [formula].

We use the notations introduced in Lemmas [\ref=IntersectionParabolicLeviCenter] and [\ref=IntersectionOutBorel], in particular [formula]. It is proven in Lemma [\ref=IntersectionParabolicLeviCenter] that there exists x∈Un0  ≤  S such that [formula]. In particular, [formula]. Therefore [formula] and [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=IntersectionOutBorel] there exists [formula] such that [formula]. Thus whence the lemma follows.

Let S be a simple exceptional group of Lie type over a field of characteristic [formula] and H be a solvable π-Hall subgroup of S. Then one of the followings hold.

There exists a maximal torus T of S such that H  ≤  N(S,T) and [formula].

[formula], [formula], |S|{2,7} = 56, H is a Frobenius group of order 56.

[formula], where ε∈{ + , - } is chosen so that [formula]; 2,3∈π, [formula], H  ≤  N(S,T), where T is a unique up to conjugation maximal torus such that N(S,T) contains a Sylow 2-subgroup of G and N(S,T) / T is a {2,3}-group. Here [formula], where [formula] and [formula].

If [formula] then by [\cite=OddHall] statement (1) of the Lemma holds.

If 2∈π and [formula], then by [\cite=Hall3'] (see also [\cite=VdoRevUspehi]) either statement (1) or statement (2) of the lemma holds.

Finally, if 2,3∈π, then S is neither a Suzuki group, nor a Ree group (since [formula]). By [\cite=VdoRevNumClasses] (see also [\cite=VdoRevUspehi]) we have [formula], H  ≤  N(S,T), where T is a unique up to conjugation maximal torus such that N(S,T) contains a Sylow 2-subgroup of S and either N(S,T) / T is a {2,3}-group, or N(S,T) / T is a Weyl group of the root system of S. Since for root systems E6,E7,E8,F4,G2 the Weyl groups are either {2,3}-groups, or unsolvable, we obtain that if S∈{Eε6(q),E7(q),E8(q)}, then H is unsolvable, whence statement (3) of the lemma.

Proof of the Main Theorem.

We proceed by considering distinct possible cases for the simple socle S of G and the structure of its π-Hall subgroup H. If S is either a Suzuki group or a Ree group, then by [\cite=BurLieSha] it follows that for every subgroup H of G the inequality [formula] holds. So we assume later that S is neither a Suzuki group, nor a Ree group.

S is a simple group of Lie type over a field of characteristic p∈π.

By Lemma [\ref=HallSubgrprop], [formula], so in this case for [formula] Lemma [\ref=SolvHallcharacteristic] holds. Assume first that [formula] lies in a Borel subgroup of Ŝ. If S is a nontwisted group of Lie type over a field of order two, then H is a 2-group. By [\cite=Zen1] the inequality [formula] holds. If S = D4(3), then H is a 3-group. By [\cite=Zen1] the inequality [formula] holds. Assume that S is not a nontwisted group of Lie type over a field of two elements, and [formula]. Then H  ≤  NG(U) = NG(B) and by Lemma [\ref=IntersectBorel] the inequality [formula] holds. If one of statements (1)-(3) of Lemma [\ref=SolvHallcharacteristic] is satisfied, then S is a classical group and calculations by using [\cite=GAP] show that in any case [formula] and [formula].

S is a simple exceptional group of Lie type over a field of characteristic [formula].

Asuume that S = E8(q). We use Lemma [\ref=BoundfprBase]. If x is a unipotent element, then [formula]. If x is a semisimple element from G = Ĝ, then by [\cite=Der2] it follows that the maximum of orders of centralizers of semisimple elements in E8(q) is not greater than whence |xG| > q112. Clealy, the inequality |xG| > q112 holds in case, when x is a field automorphism. So for c = 2 we obtain for every [formula]. Hence, [formula].

Assume that G = E7(q). We again use Lemma [\ref=BoundfprBase]. If x is a unipotent element, then [formula]. If x is a semisimple element from Ĝ, then by [\cite=Der2] it follows that the maximum of orders of centralizers of semisimple elements in E7(q) is not greater than whence |xG| > (1 / 2)q64. Clearly, the inequality |xG| > (1 / 2)q64 hols in case, when x is a field automorphism. So for c = 2 we obtain for every [formula]. Hence [formula].

Assume that G = Eε6(q). As above, we obtain that x is either a semisimple element from Ĝ, or does not lie in Ĝ. If x is a semisimple element, then by [\cite=Der1] it follows that the maximum of orders of of centralizers of semisimple elements in Eε6(q) is not greater than whence [formula]. Clearly, the inequality [formula] holds in case, when x is either a field, or a graph-field automorphism. If x is a graph automorphism, then So for c = 4 we obtain for every [formula]. Hence [formula].

Assume that G = F4(q). Again we may assume that x either is a semisimple element from G = Ĝ or does not lie in Ĝ. If x is a semisimple element, then by [\cite=Der1] it follows that the maximum of orders of centralizers of semisimple elements in F4(q) is not greater than whence |xG|  >  q16. Clearly, the inequality |xG|  >  q16 holds for every x not lying in G. So for c = 4 we obtain for every [formula]. So for [formula] the inequality [formula] holds. If q = 2, then in view of the condition [formula] we obtain that the order |H| is odd. By [\cite=OddHall] we obtain that either H is a Sylow 3-subgroup of G, or H is abelian. Hence the inequality [formula] holds: in the first case by [\cite=Zen1], and in the second case by Lemma [\ref=ZenkovAbelian].

Assume that G = G2(q). As above we may assume that x either is a semisimple element from G = Ĝ, or does not lie in Ĝ. If x is semisimple, then by [\cite=Der1] it follows that the maximum of orders of centralizers of semisimple elements in F4(q) is not greater than whence [formula]. Clearly, the inequality [formula] holds for every x not lying in G. So for c = 4 we obtain for every [formula]. Hence for [formula] the inequality [formula] holds. If q = 2, then by the condition [formula] we obtain that the order |H| is odd. By [\cite=OddHall] we obtain that either H is a Sylow 3-subgroup of G, or H is abelian. So the inequality [formula] holds: in the first case by [\cite=Zen1], and in the second case by Lemma [\ref=ZenkovAbelian].

If [formula], then by [\cite=Der1] it is easy to get the bound |xG| > q16. Using the bound we obtain that for [formula] the inequality [formula] holds. The Main Theorem is proven.

Notice that for the case p∈π we also prove the following
