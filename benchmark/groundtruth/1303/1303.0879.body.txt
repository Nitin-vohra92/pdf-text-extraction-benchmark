The generating functions of Lame equation in Weierstrass's form

Introduction

In 1837, Gabriel Lame introduced second ordinary differential equation which has four regular singular points in the method of separation of variables applied to the Laplace equation in elliptic coordinates[\cite=Lame1837]. Various authors has called this equation as 'Lame equation' or 'ellipsoidal harmonic equation'[\cite=Erde1955]. Lame function is applicable to diverse areas such as boundary value problems in ellipsoidal geometry, chaotic Hamiltonian systems, the theory of Bose-Einstein condensates, etc.

Lame equation is the special case of Heun's equation. In Ref.[\cite=Heun1889], Heun's equation is a second-order linear ordinary differential equation of the form

[formula]

As we compare ([\ref=eq:2]) with ([\ref=eq:50]), all coefficients on the above are correspondent to the following way.

[formula]

Associated Laguerre function, the special case of Hypergeometric function, arises from deriving the Laplace equation in the spherical coordinates system generally. Lame and Heun functions arise from deriving the Laplace equation in general Jacobi ellipsoidal or conical coordinates.[\cite=Kalnin2005] Also Heun polynomial arises in the separable coordinate systems on the n-sphere.[\cite=Kaln1990]

According to E. G. Kalnins and W. Miller Jr.(1990 [\cite=Kaln1990]) , "Lame and Heun functions have received relatively little attention, since they are rather intractable. Unfortunately the beautiful identities appearing have received little notice, probably because the methods of proof seemed obscure." A. Erdelyi also mentioned, "The connections between these integral equations and the question has not yet been dealt with whether the known integral equations exhaust all possible types of integral equations connected with Lame polynomials. In fact it is very plausible that they do not."(Erdelyi 1940)[\cite=Erde1940]

In Ref.[\cite=Chou2012g], I show power series expansion in closed forms of Lame function in Weierstrass's form and its representation of the form of integrals for the cases of infinite series and polynomial in which makes Bn term terminated. I show that a 2F1 function recurs in each of sub-integral forms of Lame function in Weierstrass's form: the first sub-integral form contains zero term of An's, the second one contains one term of An's, the third one contains two terms of An's, etc. And I show asymptotic expansions of Lame function for infinite series and the special case as ρ  ≈  0.

In this paper, I consider the generating function of Lame polynomial in Weierstrass's form in which makes Bn term terminated. Since the generating function of Lame polynomial is derived, we might be possible to construct orthogonal relations of Lame polynomial. In the physical point of view we might be possible to obtain the normalized constant for the wave function in modern physics, recursion relation and its expectation value of any physical quantities from the generating function of Lame polynomial. For the case of hydrogen-like atoms, the normalized wave function is derived from the generating function of associated Laguerre polynomial. And the expectation value of physical quantities such as position and momentum is constructed by applying the recursive relation of associated Laguerre polynomial.

There are three types of polynomials in three-term recurrence relation of a linear ordinary differential equation: (1) polynomial which makes Bn term terminated: An term is not terminated, (2) polynomial which makes An term terminated: Bn term is not terminated, (3) polynomial which makes An and Bn terms terminated at the same time. In general Lame polynomial (or Lame spectral polynomial) is defined as type 3 polynomial where An and Bn terms terminated. Lame polynomial comes from a Lame equation that has a fixed integer value of α, just as it has a fixed value of h. In three-term recurrence formula, polynomial of type 3 I categorize as complete polynomial. In future papers I will derive type 3 Lame polynomial. In this paper I construct the generating function for Lame polynomial of type 1: I treat the spectral parameter h as a free variable and α as a fixed value. In my next papers I will work on the generating functions for Lame polynomial of type 2.

The Lame equation in Weierstrass's form is

[formula]

where ρ, α and h are real parameters such that 0 < ρ < 1 and [formula]. If we take sn2(z,ρ) = ξ as independent variable, Lame equation becomes

[formula]

This is an equation of Fuchsian type with four regular singularities: ξ = 0,1,ρ- 2,  ∞  . In Ref.[\cite=Chou2012g], we obtain power series expansion and integral form of Lame function of the first type in Weierstrass's form by assume [formula]. Actually, there are three more types of Lame function in which are first one is [formula], second is [formula] and third is [formula][\cite=Wang1989]. We also have three term recurrence relation again. Then we obtain the analytic solution of all three cases by applying three term recurrence formula [\cite=chou2012b]: if the time is permitted, I will publish these three cases of Lame equation in Weierstrass's form.

Generating function of Lame polynomial which makes Bn term terminated in Weierstrass's form

Let's investigate the generating function of the first and second kind of Lame polynomial as Bn's term terminated at certain eigenvalue.

The generating function of Jacobi polynomial using hypergeometric functions is defined by

Summary

In my previous two papers: (1) I show the power series expansion in closed forms and integral form of Lame function in the algebraic form (infinite series and polynomial which makes Bn term terminated) and its asymptotic behaviors[\cite=Chou2012f]. (2) By applying three term recurrence formula [\cite=chou2012b], I construct the power series expansion and integral form of Lame function in the the Weierstrass�s form (infinite series and polynomial which makes Bn term terminated) and its asymptotic behaviors[\cite=Chou2012g]. In this paper I derive generating function of Lame polynomial which makes Bn term terminated in Weierstrass's form including all higher terms of An's. We can apply power series expansion in closed forms, integral form and generating function of Lame polynomial in many cases of modern physics[\cite=Brac2001] [\cite=Qian2003] [\cite=Maie2001] [\cite=Capu2000] [\cite=Kant2001] [\cite=Dobn1998] [\cite=Iach2000].

I construct the power series expansion in closed forms and analytic integral solution of linear ordinary differential equations that have three term recursion relations by using the three term recurrence formula[\cite=chou2012b]: such as Heun[\cite=chou2012c] [\cite=Chou2012d], Lame functions[\cite=Chou2012f] [\cite=Chou2012g], Grand Confluent Hypergeometric (GCH)[\cite=Chou2012i] [\cite=Chou2012j] and Mathieu[\cite=Chou2012e]. As we see all solutions of power series expansions in GCH, Mathieu, Heun and Lame functions by using the three-term recurrence formula [\cite=chou2012b], denominators and numerators in all Bn terms arise with Pochhammer symbol: the meaning of this is that the analytic solutions of any ordinary differential equations with three recursive coefficients can be described as Hypergoemetric function in a strict mathematical way.

We can express representations in closed form integrals in an easy way since we have power series expansions with Pochhammer symbols in numerators and denominators. We can transform any special functions, having three term recursive relation, into all other well-known special functions with two recursive coefficients because a 2F1 function recurs in each of sub-integral forms of them. It means all analytic solutions in the three-term recurrence can be described as Hypergoemetric function: understanding the connection between other special functions is important in the mathematical and physical points of views as we all know.

Since analytic integral form of ordinary differential equations with three recursive coefficients are derived from power series expansion in closed forms, we might be possible to construct generating function of all these polynomials. The generating function is really helpful in order to derive orthogonal relations, recursion relations and expectation values of any physical quantities as we all recognize; i.e. the normalized wave function of hydrogen-like atoms and expectation values of its physical quantities such as position and momentum.
