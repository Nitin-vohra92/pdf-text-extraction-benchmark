Inequalities for the polar derivative of a polynomial

Introduction and statement of results

Let P(z) be a polynomial of degree n, then

[formula]

Inequality [\eqref=e1] is an immediate consequence of S. Bernstein's Theorem on the derivative of a trigonometric polynomial (for reference, see [\cite=mm], [\cite=rs] or [\cite=asc]) and the result is best possible with equality holding for the polynomial P(z) = azn, a  ≠  0. If we restrict ourselves to the class of polynomials having no zero in |z| < 1, then inequality [\eqref=e1] can be replaced by

[formula]

Inequality [\eqref=e2] was conjectured by Erdös and later verified by Lax [\cite=el]. The result is sharp and equality holds for P(z) = azn + b, |a| = |b|. For the class polynomials having all zeros in |z|  ≤  1, it was proved by Turán [\cite=t] that

[formula]

The inequality [\eqref=e3] is best possible and become equality for polynomial P(z) = (z + 1)n. As an extension of [\eqref=e2] and [\eqref=e3] Malik [\cite=m] proved that if P(z)  ≠  0 in |z| < k where k  ≥  1, then

[formula]

where as if P(z) has all its zeros in |z|  ≤  k where k  ≤  1, then

[formula]

Let DαP(z) denotes the polar derivative of the polynomial P(z) of degree n with respect to the point α, then

[formula]

The polynomial DαP(z) is a polynomial of degree at most n - 1 and it generalizes the ordinary derivative in the sense that

[formula]

Now corresponding to a given nth degree polynomial P(z), we construct a sequence of polar derivatives

[formula]

The points [formula] [formula] may be equal or unequal complex numbers. The sth polar derivative [formula] of P(z) is a polynomial of degree at most n - s. For

[formula]

we have

[formula]

A. Aziz [\cite=a88] extended the inequality [\eqref=e2] to the sth polar derivative by proving if P(z) is a polynomial of degree n not vanishing in |z| < 1, then for |z|  ≥  1

[formula]

where |αj|  ≥  1, for [formula] The result is best possible and equality holds for the polynomial P(z) = (zn + 1) / 2.

As a refinement of inequality [\eqref=ae], Aziz and Wali Mohammad [\cite=aw] proved if P(z) is a polynomial of degree n not vanishing in |z| < 1, then for |z|  ≥  1

[formula]

where |αj|  ≥  1, for [formula] The result is best possible and equality holds for the polynomial P(z) = (zn + 1) / 2.

In this paper, we shall obtain several inequalities concerning the polar derivative of a polynomial and thereby obtain compact generalizations of inequalities [\eqref=ae] and [\eqref=awe].

We first prove following result from which certain interesting results follow as special cases.

If F(z) be a polynomial of degree n having all its zeros in the disk [formula] where k  ≤  1, and P(z) is a polynomial of degree n such that then for [formula] with [formula], [formula] and |z|  ≥  1,

[formula]

where

[formula]

If we choose F(z) = znM / kn, where [formula] in Theorem [\ref=t1], we get the following result.

If P(z) be a polynomial of degree n, then for [formula] with [formula], [formula] and |z|  ≥  1,

[formula]

where ns and Λs are given by [\eqref=te1'].

If [formula] then dividing both sides of [\eqref=ce1] by |α|s and letting |α|  →    ∞  , we obtain the following result.

If P(z) be a polynomial of degree n then for [formula] with [formula], and |z|  ≥  1,

[formula]

where ns is given by [\eqref=te1'].

Again, if we take [formula] then divide both sides of [\eqref=te1] by |α|s and letting |α|  →    ∞  , we obtain the following result.

If F(z) be a polynomial of degree n having all its zeros in the disk [formula] where k  ≤  1, and P(z) is a polynomial of degree n such that then for [formula] with [formula], and |z|  ≥  1,

[formula]

where ns is given by [\eqref=te1'].

If we choose P(z) = mzn / k, where m = Min|z| = k|F(z)|, in Theorem [\ref=t1] we get the following result.

If F(z) be a polynomial of degree n having all its zeros in the disk [formula] where k  ≤  1, then for [formula] with [formula], where [formula] and |z|  ≥  1,

[formula]

where ns and Λs are given by [\eqref=te1'].

Again, if we take [formula] then divide both sides of [\eqref=ce4] by |α|s and letting |α|  →    ∞  , we obtain the following result.

If F(z) be a polynomial of degree n having all its zeros in the disk [formula] where k  ≤  1, then for [formula] with [formula], and |z|  ≥  1,

[formula]

where ns is given by [\eqref=te1'].

For s  =  1, and α1  =  α in Theorem [\ref=t1] we get the following result:

If F(z) be a polynomial of degree n having all its zeros in the disk [formula] where k  ≤  1, and P(z) is a polynomial n such that then for [formula] with [formula], and |z|  ≥  1,

[formula]

If P(z) is a polynomial of degree n, which does not vanish in the disk |z| < k where k  ≤  1, then for [formula] with [formula] and |z|  ≥  1 then

[formula]

where ns and Λs are given by [\eqref=te1'].

We next prove the following refinement of Theorem [\ref=t2].

If P(z) is a polynomial of degree n and does not vanish in the disk |z| < k where k  ≤  1, then for [formula] with [formula] and |z|  ≥  1, we have

[formula]

where ns and Λs are given by [\eqref=te1'].

If we take [formula] then divide both sides of [\eqref=te1] by |α|s and letting |α|  →    ∞  , we obtain the following result.

If P(z) is a polynomial of degree n, which does not vanish in the disk |z| < k where k  ≤  1, then for [formula] with |β|  ≤  1 and |z|  ≥  1 then

[formula]

where ns is given by [\eqref=te1'].

For s = 1 in Corollary [\ref=c7], we get the following result.

If P(z) is a polynomial of degree n, which does not vanish in the disk |z| < k where k  ≤  1, then for [formula] with |α|  ≥  k,|β|  ≤  1 and |z|  ≥  1 then

[formula]

For β = 0, Theorem [\ref=t3] reduces to the following result.

If P(z) is a polynomial of degree n, which does not vanish in the disk |z| < k where k  ≤  1, then for [formula] with [formula] and |z|  ≥  1 then

[formula]

where ns is given by [\eqref=te1'].

If we take [formula] then divide both sides of [\eqref=te1] by |α|s and letting |α|  →    ∞  , we obtain the following result.

If P(z) is a polynomial of degree n, which does not vanish in the disk |z| < k where k  ≤  1, then for [formula] with [formula] and |z|  ≥  1 then

[formula]

If s = 1 and α1  =  α then inequality [\eqref=te3] reduces to the following result.

If P(z) is a polynomial of degree n, which does not vanish in the disk |z| < k where k  ≤  1, then for [formula] with |α|  ≥  k,|β|  ≤  1 and |z|  ≥  1 then

[formula]

Lemmas

For the proof of Theorems, we need the following Lemmas. The first Lemma follows by repeated application of Laguerre's theorem [\cite=al] or[\cite=marden].

If all the zeros of nth degree polynomial lie in circular region C and if none of the points [formula] lie in circular region C, then each of the polar derivatives

[formula]

has all its zeros in C.

The next Lemma is due to Aziz and Rather [\cite=ar98].

If P(z) is a polynomial of degree n, having all zeros in the closed disk |z|  ≤  k, k  ≤  1, then for every real or complex number α with |α|  ≥  k and |z| = 1, we have

[formula]

If [formula] is a polynomial of degree n having all its zeros in |z|  ≤  k, k  ≤  1 then

[formula]

The above lemma follows by taking μ = 1 in the result due to Aziz and Rather [\cite=ar04].

If P(z) be a polynomial of degree n having all zeros in the disk |z|  ≤  k where k  ≤  1, then for [formula] with [formula] (1  ≤  s < n), and |z| = 1

[formula]

where ns and Λs are defined in [\eqref=te1'].

The result is trivial if |αj| = k for at least one j where [formula] Therefore, we assume |αj| > k for all [formula] We shall prove Lemma by principle of mathematical induction. For t = 1 the result is follows by Lemma [\ref=l2]. We assume that the result is true for t = q, which means that for |z| = 1, we have

[formula]

and we will prove that the Lemma is true for t = q + 1 also. Since [formula] and |α1| > k, Dα1P(z) is a polynomial of degree n - 1. If this is not true, then

[formula]

which implies

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=l3], we have

[formula]

But this is the contradiction to the fact |α| > k. Hence, Dα1P(z) is a polynomial of degree n - 1 and by Lemma [\ref=l1], Dα1P(z) has all its zeros in |z|  ≤  k. By the similar argument as before, Dα2Dα1P(z) must be a polynomial of degree n - 2 for |α1| > k, |α2| > k and all its zeros in |z|  ≤  k. Continuing in this way, we conclude [formula] is a polynomial of degree n - q for all |αj| > k, [formula] and has all zeros in |z|  ≤  k. Applying Lemma [\ref=l2] to Pq(z), we get for |αq + 1| > k,

[formula]

Inequality [\eqref=l4pe2] in conjunction with [\eqref=l4pe1] gives for |z| = 1,

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] This shows that the result is true for s = q + 1 also. This completes the proof of Lemma [\ref=l4].

If P(z) be a polynomial of degree n, then for [formula] with [formula] (1  ≤  t < n), |β|  ≤  1 and |z|  ≥  1,

[formula]

where ns and Λs are defined in [\eqref=te1'] and [formula]

Let [formula] Therefore, for every λ with |λ| > 1, |P(z)| < |λMzn / kn| on |z| = k. By Rouche's theorem it follows that all the zeros of F(z) = P(z) + λMzn / kn lie in |z| < k. If [formula] then |knG(z / k2)| = |F(z)| for |z| = k and hence for any δ with |δ| > 1, the polynomial H(z) = knG(z / k2) + δF(z) has all its zeros in |z| < k. By applying Lemma [\ref=l4] to H(z), we have for [formula] with [formula] (1  ≤  t < n), Therefore, for any β with |β| < 1 and |z| = 1, we have Since |αj| > k, [formula] by Lemma [\ref=l1] the polynomial zsHs(z) has all its zeros in |z| < 1 and by Rouche's theorem, the polynomial

[formula]

has all its zeros in |z| < 1. Replacing H(z) by knG(z / k2) + δF(z), we conclude that the polynomial

[formula]

has all its zero in |z| < 1. This gives for |β| < 1, |αj|  ≥  k, where [formula] and |z|  ≥  1.

[formula]

If inequality [\eqref=le34] is not true, then there is a point z0 with |z0|  ≥  1 such that Since all the zeros of F(z) lie in |z| < k, proceeding similarly as in case of H(z), it follows that the polynomial [formula] has all its zeros in |z| < 1, and hence [formula] Now, choosing

[formula]

then δ is a well-defined real or complex number, with |δ| > 1 and T(z0) = 0, which contradicts the fact that T(z) has all zeros in |z| < 1. Thus, [\eqref=le34] holds. Now, replacing F(z) by P(z) + λMzn / kn and G(z) by [formula] in [\eqref=le34], we have for |z|  ≥  1,

[formula]

Choosing the argument of λ in the right hand side of [\eqref=le35] such that

[formula]

which is possible by Corollary [\ref=c1], then for |z|  ≥  1, we have

[formula]

Making |λ|  →  1 and using the continuity for |β| = 1 and |αj| = k, where [formula] in [\eqref=le36], we get the inequality [\eqref=le5].

Proof of Theorems

By hypothesis F(z) is a polynomial of degree n having all in zeros in the closed disk |z|  ≤  k and P(z) is a polynomial of degree n such that

[formula]

therefore, if F(z) has a zero of multiplicity s at z = keiθ0, then P(z) has a zero of multiplicity at least s at z = keiθ0. If P(z) / F(z) is a constant, then inequality [\eqref=t1e1] is obvious. We now assume that P(z) / F(z) is not a constant, so that by the maximum modulus principle, it follows that

[formula]

Suppose F(z) has m zeros on |z| = k where 0  ≤  m  <  n, so that we can write

[formula]

where F1(z) is a polynomial of degree m whose all zeros lie on |z| = k and F2(z) is a polynomial of degree exactly n - m having all its zeros in |z| < k. This implies with the help of inequality [\eqref=t1e1] that

[formula]

where P1(z) is a polynomial of degree at most n - m. Again, from inequality [\eqref=t1e1], we have

[formula]

where F2(z)  ≠  0    for    |z| = k. Therefore for every real or complex number λ with |λ| > 1, a direct application of Rouche's theorem shows that the zeros of the polynomial P1(z) - λF2(z) of degree n - m  ≥  1 lie in |z| < k hence the polynomial

[formula]

has all its zeros in |z|  ≤  k. Therefore for r > 1, all the zeros of G(rz) lie in |z|  ≤  k / r < k By applying Lemma [\ref=l4] to the polynomial G(rz), then for |z| = 1, we have Equivalently for |z| = 1, we have

[formula]

Therefore, we have for any β with |β| < 1 and |z| = 1,

[formula]

Since |αj| > k, [formula] by Rouche's theorem, the polynomial

[formula]

has all zeros in |z| < 1. This implies for |z|  ≥  1

[formula]

If it is true, then we have for some z0 with |z0|  ≥  k,

[formula]

Since [formula] we can choose

[formula]

λ is well-defined real or complex number with |λ| < 1 and with this choice of λ, and T(rz0) = 0 for |z0|  ≥  k. But this is a contradiction to the fact that T(rz)  ≠  0 for |z|  ≥  1. Thus [\eqref=t1p1] holds. Letting r  →  1, in [\eqref=t1p1], we get the desired result.

Let [formula] Since P(z) does not vanish in the disk |z| < k,    k  ≤  1, then the polynomial Q(z / k2) has all zeros in |z|  ≤  k. Applying Theorem [\ref=t1] to knQ(z / k2) and noting that |P(z)| = |knQ(z / k2)| for |z| = k, we have for all [formula] with |αj|  ≥  1, [formula] |β|  ≤  1, and |z|  ≥  1,

[formula]

Inequality [\eqref=t2e1] in conjunction with Lemma [\ref=l5] gives for all [formula] with |αj|  ≥  k, [formula] |β|  ≤  1, and |z|  ≥  1,

[formula]

which is equivalent to [\eqref=te2].

Let m = Min|z| = k|P(z)|. If P(z) has a zero on |z| = k, then m = 0 and result follows from Theorem [\ref=t2]. Therefore, We assume that P(z) has all its zeros in |z| > k where k  ≤  1 so that m  >  0. Now for every λ with |λ| < 1, it follows by Rouche's theorem that h(z) = P(z) - λm does not vanish in |z| < k. Let [formula] then, the polynomial g(z / k2) has all its zeros in |z|  ≤  k. As |kng(z / k2)| = |h(z)| for |z| = k, applying Theorem [\ref=t1] to kng(z / k2), we get for [formula] with |αj|  ≥  k, [formula] |β|  ≤  1 and |z|  ≥  1,

[formula]

Equivalently for |z|  ≥  1, we have

[formula]

Since Q(z / k2) has all its zeros in |z|  ≤  k and [formula] by Corollary [\ref=c4] applied to Q(z / k2), we have for |z|  ≥  1,

[formula]

Now, choosing the argument of λ on the right hand side of inequality [\eqref=t3e2] such that

[formula]

which is possible by inequality [\eqref=t3e3], we get for |z|  ≥  1,

[formula]

Letting λ  →  1, we have for |z|  ≥  1,

[formula]

Adding [\eqref=le5] and [\eqref=t3e4], we get for |z|  ≥  1

[formula]

which is equivalent to [\eqref=te3]. This completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=t3].
