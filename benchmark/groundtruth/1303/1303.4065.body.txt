Introduction

Let n, k, t, and λ be positive integers satisfying [formula]. A t-[formula]-design is a k-uniform hypergraph [formula] on n vertices with the following property: every t-set of vertices A  ⊂  X is contained in exactly λ edges F∈F. The special case λ = 1 is known as a Steiner system with parameters t, k, and n, named after Jakob Steiner who pondered the existence of such systems in 1853. Steiner systems, t-designs and other combinatorial designs turn out to be useful in a multitude of applications, e.g., in coding theory, storage systems design, and wireless communication. For a survey of the subject, the reader is referred to [\cite=handbook-of-combinatorial-designs].

A counting argument shows that a Steiner triple system -- that is, a 2-[formula]-design -- can only exist when [formula]. For every such n, this is achieved via constructions based on symmetric idempotent quasigroups. Geometric constructions over finite fields give rise to some further infinite families of Steiner systems with t = 2 and t = 3. For instance, for a prime power q and an integer [formula], affine geometries yield 2-[formula]-designs, projective geometries yield 2-[formula]-designs and spherical geometries yield 3-[formula]-designs.

For t = 4 and t = 5, only finitely many nontrivial constructions of Steiner systems are known; for [formula], no constructions are known at all.

Before stating our result, let us extend the definition of t-designs as follows. Let n, k, and t be positive integers satisfying [formula] and let Λ be a set of positive integers. A t-[formula]-design is a k-uniform hypergraph [formula] on n vertices with the following property: for every t-set of vertices A  ⊂  X, the number of edges F∈F that contain A belongs to Λ. Clearly, when [formula] is a singleton, a t-[formula]-design coincides with a t-[formula]-design as defined above.

Not able to construct Steiner systems for large t, Erds and Hanani [\cite=EH63] aimed for large partial Steiner systems; that is, t-[formula]-designs with as many edges as possible. Since a Steiner system has exactly [formula] edges, they conjectured the existence of partial Steiner systems with [formula] edges. This was first proved by R�dl [\cite=Rodl85] in 1985, with further refinements [\cite=Grable99] [\cite=Kim01] [\cite=KR98] of the [formula] term, as stated in the following theorem:

Let k and t be integers such that [formula] . Then there exists a partial Steiner system with parameters t, k, and n covering all but [formula] of the t-sets.

Theorem [\ref=thm:partial-steiner] can also be rephrased in terms of a covering rather than a packing; that is, it asserts the existence of a system with [formula] edges such that every t-set is covered at least once (see, e.g., [\cite=the-probabilistic-method]). Nevertheless, some t-sets might be covered multiple times (perhaps even [formula] times). It is therefore natural to ask for t-[formula]-designs, where r is as small as possible. The main aim of this short note is to show how to extend Theorem [\ref=thm:partial-steiner] to cover all t-sets at least once but at most twice.

Let k and t be integers such that [formula]. Then, for sufficiently large n, there exists a t-[formula]-design.

Our proof actually gives a stronger result: there exists a t-[formula]-design with [formula] edges.

Preliminaries

In this section we present results needed for the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:main].

Given a t-[formula]-design [formula], we define the leave hypergraph [formula] to be the t-uniform hypergraph whose edges are the t-sets A  ⊂  X not covered by any edge F∈F.

Following closely the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:partial-steiner] appearing in [\cite=Grable99], we recover an extended form of the theorem, which is a key ingredient in the proof of our main result.

Let k and t be integers such that [formula]. There exists a constant [formula] such that for sufficiently large n, there exists a partial Steiner system [formula] with parameters t, k, and n satisfying the following property:

For every [formula], every set X'  ⊂  X of size [formula] is contained in [formula] edges of the leave hypergraph.

We also make use of the following probabilistic tool.

Talagrand's inequality.

In its general form, Talagrand's inequality is an isoperimetric-type inequality for product probability spaces. We use the following formulation from [\cite=graph-colouring-and-the-probabilistic-method], suitable for showing that a random variable in a product space is unlikely to overshoot its expectation under two conditions:

Let [formula] be a non-trivial random variable, which is determined by n independent trials [formula]. Let c > 0 and suppose that the following properties hold:

(c-Lipschitz) changing the outcome of one trial can affect Z by at most c, and

(Certifiable) for any s, if Z  ≥  s then there is a set of at most s trials whose outcomes certify that Z  ≥  s.

Then [formula] for any [formula].

Proof of the main result

In this section we prove Theorem [\ref=thm:main].

Outline

The construction is done in two phases:

Apply Theorem [\ref=thm:partial-steiner-ext] to get a t-[formula]-design [formula] with property [formula] with respect to some 0 < ε < 1.

Build another t-[formula]-design [formula] that covers the uncovered t-sets LH.

Combining both designs, we get that every t-set is covered at least once but no more than twice; namely [formula] is a t-[formula]-design, as required.

We now describe how to build H'. For a set A  ⊂  X, denote by [formula] the family of possible continuations of A to a subset of X of cardinality k. Note that [formula] when [formula].

Consider the leave hypergraph [formula]. Our goal is to choose, for every uncovered t-set A∈LH, a k-set A'∈TA such that [formula] for every two distinct A,B∈LH. This ensures that the obtained hypergraph [formula] is indeed a t-[formula]-design.

To this aim, for every A∈LH we introduce intermediate lists RA  ⊆  SA  ⊆  TA that will help us control the cardinalities of pairwise intersections when choosing A'∈RA. First note that we surely cannot afford to consider continuations that fully contain some other B∈LH, so we restrict ourselves to the list

[formula]

Note that, by definition, the lists SA for different A are disjoint. Next, choose a much smaller sub-list RA  ⊆  SA by picking each C∈SA to RA independently at random with probability p = nt - k + ε / 2 (we can of course assume here and later that ε < 1  ≤  k - t, and thus 0 < p < 1). Finally, select A'∈RA that has no intersection of size at least t with any C∈RB for any other B∈LH. If there is such a choice for every A∈LH, we get [formula] for distinct A,B∈LH, as requested.

Details

We start by showing that the lists SA are large enough.

For every A∈LH we have [formula].

Fix A∈LH. Obviously [formula]. Since SA  ⊆  TA, it suffices to show that [formula].

Writing [formula] as the disjoint union [formula], where [formula], we have

[formula]

Note that for all [formula] and for all [formula], [formula] and thus [formula]. Moreover, [formula] by Property [formula]. Thus,

[formula]

establishing the claim.

Recall that the sub-list RA  ⊆  SA was obtained by picking each C∈SA to RA independently at random with probability p = nt - k + ε / 2. The next claim shows that RA typically contains many k-sets whose pairwise intersections are exactly A. This will be used in the proof of Claim [\ref=clm:one-good-set].

Almost surely (i.e., with probability tending to 1 as n tends to infinity), for every A∈LH, the family RA contains a subset QA  ⊆  RA of size [formula] such that [formula] for every two distinct C1,C2∈QA.

Fix A∈LH. Construct QA greedily as follows: start with [formula]; as long as [formula] and there exists [formula] such that [formula] for all C'∈QA, add C to QA. It suffices to show that this process continues [formula] steps.

If the process halts after [formula] steps, then every k-tuple of RA intersects one of the s previously chosen sets in some vertex outside A. This means that there exists a subset XA  ⊂  X of cardinality |XA| = knε / 3 (XA contains the union of these s previously picked sets) such that none of the edges C of SA satisfying [formula] is chosen into RA. For bounding the number of such edges in SA from bellow, we need to subtract from |SA| the number of edges C∈TA with [formula]. The latter can be bounded (from above) by [formula] (choose 1  ≤  i  ≤  k - t vertices from XA, other than A, to be in C, and then choose the remaining k - t - i vertices from [formula]). Since [formula], and since

[formula]

we obtain that the number of such edges in SA is at least [formula]. It thus follows that the probability of the latter event to happen for a given A is at most

[formula]

(choose XA first, and then require all edges of SA intersecting XA only at A to be absent from RA). The above estimate is clearly at most

[formula]

Taking the union bound over all ([formula]) choices of A establishes the claim.

The last step is to select a well-behaved set A'∈RA. The next claim shows this is indeed possible.

Almost surely for every A∈LH we can select A'∈RA such that [formula] for all [formula].

Fix A∈LH and fix all the random choices which determine the list RA such that it satisfies Claim [\ref=clm:many-disjoint-candidates]. Let QA  ⊆  RA be as provided by Claim [\ref=clm:many-disjoint-candidates] and let [formula] be the random family of all obstacle sets. Define the random variable Z to be the number of sets A'∈QA for which [formula] for some C∈R. Since SA is disjoint from [formula], we can view R as a random subset of S, with each element selected to R independently with probability p = nt - k + ε / 2. Thus Z is determined by [formula] independent trials. We wish to show that Z is not too large via Theorem [\ref=thm:talagrand-ineq]; for this, Z has to satisfy the two conditions therein.

If C∈S satisfies [formula] for some A'∈QA then [formula] must intersect [formula] (since [formula]). However, the [formula]-sets [formula] are pairwise disjoint (by the definition of QA) so each C cannot rule out more than k different sets A'∈QA. Thus Z is k-Lipschitz.

Assume that Z  ≥  s. Then, by definition, there exist distinct sets [formula] and (not necessarily distinct) sets [formula] such that [formula] for [formula]. These are at most s trials whose outcomes ensure that Z  ≥  s; i.e., Z is certifiable.

Let us now calculate [formula]. Fix A'∈QA and let ZA' be the indicator random variable of the event [formula]. The only set in LH fully contained in A' is A, so we can write [formula] as the disjoint union [formula], where [formula]. For any [formula] and [formula], the number of bad sets (i.e., sets that will trigger EA') in SB is

[formula]

since C contains B, [formula], together with [formula] elements from [formula] and the rest from [formula]. Each such bad set ends up in RB with probability p = nε / 2 + t - k, so the expected number of bad sets in RB is [formula]. By Property [formula] we have [formula] and thus the total expected number of bad sets in R is [formula]. By Markov's inequality we have

[formula]

Now, Z is a sum of [formula] random variables ZA' and thus

[formula]

Applying Theorem [\ref=thm:talagrand-ineq] with [formula] and [formula], we get that

[formula]

Taking the union bound over all [formula] choices of A∈LH establishes the claim.
