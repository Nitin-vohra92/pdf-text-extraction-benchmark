Base manifolds for Lagrangian fibrations on hyperkähler manifolds

Introduction

One of the most important and startling conjectures in the study of hyperkähler manifolds X says that the base space of any non-trivial fibration [formula] is the complex projective space [formula], where n  =   dim X / 2. We refer the reader to [\cite=GHJ] for a discussion of this conjecture. Any such fibration is automatically Lagrangian with respect to the holomorphic symplectic form by works of Matsushita; see [\cite=Matsus03] or Section [\ref=sect:prelim] for a summary of his results.

With the additional hypothesis that X be projective and that B be smooth, the conjecture is known to hold by work of Jun-Muk Hwang [\cite=Hwang]. In this short note, we remove Hwang's projectivity assumption on X, and prove the following result:

Our proof is a simple combination of fundamental results due to A. Fujiki [\cite=Fuj83], J.-M. Hwang [\cite=Hwang], D. Matsushita [\cite=Matsus03] [\cite=Matsus09], and Y.-T. Siu [\cite=SiuDeformationRigidityPn]: after noticing that the base manifold has to be projective, we pull back a very ample line bundle from B to X and use this line bundle to deform the given fibration to a sequence of projective ones. Then, we apply Hwang's theorem to these projective deformations and use global deformation rigidity of [formula] to conclude the desired result for the central fibre.

Preliminaries

We start by fixing our notation and by recalling definitions of the basic objects investigated in this note.

A compact Kähler manifold is called hyperkähler or irreducible holomorphic symplectic if it is simply-connected, and if [formula], where σ is everywhere non-degenerate. A fibration on X is a (proper) surjective holomorphic map [formula] with f*OX  =  OB from X to a complex space B with 0 <  dim B  <   dim X. In particular, the base B of a fibration is normal, and f has connected fibres. A Lagrangian fibration on X is a fibration [formula] such that every irreducible component of every fibre of f is a Lagrangian subvariety with respect to the holomorphic symplectic form σ.

To make this note more self-contained, we collect some known results concerning fibrations on hyperkähler manifolds, which we will use in the subsequent proof, in the following proposition.

As explained in [\cite=AmerikCampanaTori], using results of Varouchas [\cite=Va86] [\cite=Va89] and the fundamental results of Matsushita [\cite=Matsus99a] [\cite=Matsus01a] [\cite=Matsus00], one shows without any a priori assumption on the base of the fibration that B is a normal Kähler space. Then, [\cite=Matsus03] imply the claim.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm_main]

Let X be a hyperkähler manifold of dimension 2n, and let [formula] be a fibration onto a smooth complex space B.

Since B is projective by Proposition [\ref=prop:generalisedMatsushita], there exists a very ample line bundle on B. Let L denote its pullback under f. Furthermore, let [formula] be the (smooth) Kuranishi space of X; in particular, [formula] is a smooth family of hyperkähler manifolds. By [\cite=Matsus09] there exists a smooth hypersurface (SL,0) in (S,0), and a line bundle [formula] on the pullback [formula] of [formula] to SL such that the restriction of [formula] to the fibre over the reference point 0 is isomorphic to L. We denote the natural projection [formula] by p, and we note that both [formula] as well as p are smooth. As usual we will take a representative of the germ (SL,0) and shrink it if necessary (keeping the base point), usually without mentioning this explicitly.

By [\cite=Matsus09] the pushforward [formula] is a vector bundle, the canonical map [formula] is surjective, and thus gives rise to a morphism [formula] over SL that extends [formula] to the whole family [formula].

Let α be a Kähler class on X. Since L is not ample, its Chern class is not a multiple of α, hence h1,1(X)  ≥  2, implying the first claim. For the second claim, note that the dimension of the Kuranishi space S of X is dim H1(X,TX)  =  h1,1(X)  ≥  2, and that SL is a hyperplane in S.

So [formula] is a positive-dimensional smooth family of hyperkähler manifolds. Restricting the family [formula] to a general smooth embedded disk Δ  ⊂  SL through the origin, we obtain a commutative diagram

[formula]

where [formula] is a smooth family of hyperkähler manifolds with smooth total space, and [formula] is the scheme-theoretic image of the fibration induced by a sufficiently high tensor power of [formula]. Note that [formula] is a flat family with normal total space.

Since [formula] is normal, it is non-singular at general points of the central fibre. Since p is a smooth morphism, it follows from diagram [\eqref=restr_fibration] that [formula] is generically reduced. Let t be a coordinate on Δ. We note that π*t is not a zerodivisor in any of the local rings [formula] of points b∈π- 1(0). Consequently, as [formula] satisfies Serre's condition S2, the scheme [formula] does not have any embedded components, and is therefore reduced, cf. [\cite=Matsumura]. Hence, [formula], which is smooth by assumption.

Lemma [\ref=lem:reduced] implies that [formula] is flat with smooth central fibre, hence a smooth morphism. Moreover, [\cite=Fuj83] implies that there exists a dense subset T  ⊂  Δ such that Xt: = p- 1(t) is projective for all t∈T, see also [\cite=GHJ]. Therefore, by Hwang's theorem [\cite=Hwang] the fibre Bt: = π- 1(t) is isomorphic to [formula] for all t∈T. Hence, we find a sequence of points [formula] in T  ⊂  Δ such that [formula], and such that [formula]. Hence, global deformation rigidity of [formula], see [\cite=SiuDeformationRigidityPn] implies that the central fibre is likewise isomorphic to [formula]. This concludes the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm_main].
