Asymptotic analysis of solutions to a gauged O(3) sigma model

Introduction

In a recent paper [\cite=T1], G. Tarantello has considered the following Chern-Simons-Higgs (CSH) model:

[formula]

where Ω is a flat 2-torus, pj are distinct points of Ω, and δp stands for the Dirac measure concentrated at p. Each pj for 1  ≤  j  ≤  d is said to be a vortex point. Among other things, the following theorem was proved in [\cite=T1].

Theorem A. For given {pj} and [formula], there exists [formula] such that if ε∈(0,ε0), then there exists a unique topological solution [formula] for ([\ref=chseq]), i.e. a unique solution which satisfies [formula] a.e. in Ω as [formula].

The CSH model has been proposed more than twenty years ago in [\cite=HKP] and independently in [\cite=JW] to describe vortices in high temperature superconductivity. Actually, ([\ref=chseq]) was derived from the Euler-Lagrange equations of the CSH model via a vortex ansatz, see [\cite=HKP] [\cite=JW] [\cite=T2] [\cite=Y]. We also refer to [\cite=CK] [\cite=CKL] [\cite=LY1] [\cite=LY2] [\cite=NT] for more recent developments.

Here we are concerned with another nonlinear equation arising in the study of the gauged O(3) sigma model with the Chern-Simons term:

[formula]

where τ∈(0,  ∞  ) is a real parameter. We assume that [formula] for all 1  ≤  j  ≤  di and i = 1,2. Let

[formula]

be the set of vortex points in Ω. We define [formula] and [formula]. We also adopt the notations [formula] and [formula]. For the physical background of this model and other recent studies, we refer to [\cite=ChN] [\cite=C] [\cite=CHLL] [\cite=CN] and the references quoted therein.

One of the natural questions is whether Theorem A also holds for ([\ref=maineq]). In [\cite=T1], Tarantello proved that if [formula] is a topological solution, then [formula] is strictly stable solution. The uniqueness of the topological solutions was established as a consequence of this fact. In this paper, we study the uniqueness of stable solutions instead of topological solutions, because the definition of a topological solution depends on a sequence of solutions, not only the solution itself. Here u is called a stable solution of ([\ref=maineq]) if the linearized equation of ([\ref=maineq]) at u has nonnegative eigenvalues. In this paper, we prove the equivalence of stable solutions and topological solutions under certain assumptions. To state our result, we need the following conditions:

Then we have the following theorem.

Let [formula] be a sequence of solutions of ([\ref=maineq]) with ε > 0. (i) if [formula] a.e. in [formula] as [formula], then [formula] is a strictly stable solution for sufficiently small ε > 0. (ii) if (H1-2) hold and [formula] is a sequence of stable solutions, then [formula] a.e. in [formula] as [formula].

A nontopological entire solution of the CSH equation ([\ref=chseq]) is always unstable (see Appendix). Hence for a sequence of stable solutions [formula] of the CSH equation ([\ref=chseq]), we can prove that [formula] is a topological solution for small ε > 0. The proof is simpler than (ii) of Theorem [\ref=stable].

As a consequence of Theorem [\ref=stable], we also have the following result about the uniqueness of stable solutions of ([\ref=maineq]).

Let [formula] be a sequence of solutions of ([\ref=maineq]) with ε > 0. If (H1-2) hold, then there exists ε0: = ε0(Z,mj,i) > 0 such that there exists a unique stable solution of ([\ref=maineq]) for each ε∈(0,ε0).

We remark that the uniqueness of topological solutions of ([\ref=maineq]) always holds even without the assumptions (H1-2). Indeed, this result and (i) of Theorem [\ref=stable] can be proved by a suitable adaptation of the argument in [\cite=T1]. Roughly speaking, this is due to the fact that the behavior of a topological solution is the same no matter whether it is a solution of ([\ref=chseq]) or of ([\ref=maineq]). See either Proposition 4.8 in [\cite=T1] or Lemma [\ref=speedofconvergence] below.

However, there are dramatic differences between these two equations when stable solutions are considered. First of all, the asymptotic analysis is relatively easier for the CSH equation ([\ref=chseq]). By the maximum principle, any solution u of the CSH equation ([\ref=chseq]) is always negative, thus eu(1 - eu) is always positive. On the contrary, a solution u(x) of the equation ([\ref=maineq]) could tend to either +    ∞   or -    ∞   as x converges to a vortex point in case [formula] and [formula]. This fact readily implies that the nonlinear term fτ(u) must change sign in Ω and this is of course the cause of a lot of difficulties in the study of the asymptotic behavior of [formula] as [formula].

Secondly, any nontopological entire solution of the CSH equation ([\ref=chseq]) is always unstable. This might not be true for the equation ([\ref=maineq]). Indeed, it has been proved that any nontopological radially symmetric entire solution of ([\ref=maineq]) is unstable provided that either τ = 1 or mj,i∈[0,1] for all i, j. Hence if [formula] and mj,i > 1 for some i, j, then there might exist nontopological stable entire solutions for ([\ref=maineq]). Of course, this fact might complicate our analysis, because stable solutions might be bubbling even at a vortex point pj,i, where [formula] and mj,i > 1. Our condition (H2) partly reflects this fact. However, (H2) still allows the possibility that mj,k > 1 as far as the global condition Ni > Nk is satisfied, since in this case one can prove that stable solutions cannot blow up at pj,k. But it is still an interesting open problem to see whether those conditions are necessary or not and we will discuss it in another paper.

If any one of the Ni's is zero, then Theorem [\ref=stable]-[\ref=uniqueness] hold even without the assumptions (H1-2).

To understand the asymptotic behavior of solutions of ([\ref=maineq]) as [formula], we also ask whether or not there might exist a sequence of solutions [formula] for ([\ref=maineq]) such that

[formula]

where [formula] for any fixed r > 0. The following theorem tells us that the kind of blow-up behavior as introduced in ([\ref=asympimpossible]) cannot occur.

Let [formula] be a sequence of solutions of ([\ref=maineq]). Then, up to subsequences, one of the following holds true:

(a) [formula] uniformly on any compact subset of [formula];

(b) for any compact subset [formula], there exists νK > 0 such that

[formula]

(c) for any compact subset [formula], there exists νK > 0 such that

[formula]

Besides the application to our analysis, we believe that the above alternative could be useful in further studies of ([\ref=maineq]).

We also remark that it is important to use a suitable Pohozaev type identity for handling solutions with different asymptotic behavior. The following antiderivatives of fτ(u) are used to this purpose depending on the situations at hand: and

Moreover, we denote by G the Green's function on Ω which satisfies

[formula]

and by [formula] its regular part. We also define,

[formula]

and therefore we see that it holds

[formula]

The rest of this paper is devoted to the proof of the above theorems. In Section 2, we discuss some preliminary results. In Section 3, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of solutions of ([\ref=maineq]) as [formula]. In Section 4-6, we study the asymptotic behavior of stable solutions. The main purpose is to prove some identities involving data coming from different regions, one being a neighborhood of the vortex point and the other one its complement. The more subtle part is the asymptotic analysis of the bubbling behavior of stable solutions at vortex points. Finally, we prove Theorems [\ref=stable]-[\ref=uniqueness].

Preliminaries

We consider the following limiting problem for ([\ref=maineq]) when Z is empty,

[formula]

and we also define (recall [formula])

[formula]

By applying the method of moving planes as introduced in [\cite=GNN] and improved in [\cite=ChL] and [\cite=SY], we obtain the following lemma.

Let u be a solution of ([\ref=limitingproinr2]). Assume that there exists a constant [formula] such that

[formula]

If [formula], then u is radially symmetric about some point [formula].

The proof of Lemma [\ref=radiallysymm] is standard and we just provide a sketch for reader's convenience. First of all, we observe that [formula]. Next we define

[formula]

so that Δv = fτ(u) and by known elliptic estimates

[formula]

At this point we may define h = u + v and then observe that Δh = 0.

Step 1. Now we claim that h is constant in [formula]. If u  ≤  c or u  ≥  c in [formula] for some constant [formula] , then ([\ref=limofv]) implies that either h  ≤  c1( ln (|x| + 1) + 1) or h  ≥  c1( ln (|x| + 1) + 1) for some constant [formula]. Then, by Liouville's theorem, [formula]. Now we consider the case [formula]. Then, we also see that [formula] is bounded. By the mean value theorem, there exist constants [formula] such that

[formula]

for any [formula], [formula] and |α| = 2 (see Theorem 2.10 in [\cite=GT]). Then Dαh is a constant for |α| = 2 since Dαh is bounded and harmonic in [formula]. After a coordinates transformation, we can assume that either h(x) = a(x21 - x22) + b or h(x) = cx1 + dx2 + e for some constants [formula] where x = (x1,x2). Hence ([\ref=limofv]) implies that either

[formula]

or

[formula]

For a fixed δ∈(0,1) we can find a constant Cδ > 0 such that

[formula]

Therefore, by using ([\ref=uasym1]) and ([\ref=uasym2]), we see that [formula] unless h is constant which proves the claim. Then, as a consequence of ([\ref=limofv]), we see that

[formula]

Step 2. We claim that if β = 0 then [formula]. Suppose that there exists [formula] such that u(x0) < 0. Then there exists r > 0 such that

[formula]

Let us set [formula] on [formula]. Then we see that vδ  ≥  u on ∂Br(x0). Since u = o( ln |x|) as |x|  →    ∞   (which is of course a consequence of ([\ref=asymuatinf]) and β = 0), then there exists Rδ > 0 such that vδ > u on [formula]. We claim that vδ  ≥  u on [formula]. If not, there exists [formula] such that [formula]. Then by the maximum principle, we see that

[formula]

Thus, [formula] on [formula]. Since δ > 0 is arbitrary, we conclude that

[formula]

Now we see that ([\ref=lessat]) and ([\ref=outside]) together contradict ([\ref=defofbeta]) with β = 0. Therefore we have u  ≥  0 on [formula], and then, by using ([\ref=defofbeta]) together with β = 0, we conclude that [formula] on [formula].

Step 3. From now on, we consider the case [formula]. By using the strong maximum principle and ([\ref=asymuatinf]), we conclude that

[formula]

In view of ([\ref=forkelvintrasformation]), we can use the maximum principle to show that

[formula]

for large |x| and a suitable constant [formula]. By using ([\ref=fromit]), then [formula] implies that |β| > 2 and then we deduce the sharper estimate

[formula]

At this point, the method of moving planes to be used together with ([\ref=startclaim]) shows that u is radially symmetric. Since the proof is standard we skip it here and refer to [\cite=ChL] [\cite=GNN] for further details. Therefore, the proof of Lemma [\ref=radiallysymm] is completed.

Let u(r;s) be the solution of the following initial value problem

[formula]

where u' denotes [formula] and let us set

[formula]

It turns out that the solutions of ([\ref=limitingpro]) admit only three kinds of limiting conditions as r  →    ∞  :

[formula]

We will use the following lemma recently obtained in [\cite=CHLL].

Let u(r;s) be a solution of ([\ref=limitingpro]). Then, we have

(i) β(0) = 0. In this case, [formula] is the unique topological solution of ([\ref=limitingpro]);

(ii) β:( -   ∞  ,0)  →  (4,  ∞  ) is strictly increasing and bijective and

[formula]

In this case, u(r;s) is a nontopological solution of type I;

(iii) β:(0,  ∞  )  →  ( -   ∞  , - 4) is strictly increasing and bijective and

[formula]

In this case, u(r;s) is a nontopological solution of type II.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=BrezisMerletypealternatives]: the asymptotic behavior of solutions

One of the main steps in the proof of Theorem [\ref=BrezisMerletypealternatives] is to obtain a uniform bound for Toward this goal we have the following lemma.

Let [formula] be a sequence of solutions of ([\ref=maineq]). Then, there exists a constant M0∈(0,  ∞  ) such that

[formula]

We observe that, for any a∈(0,  ∞  ), it holds

[formula]

Then, multiplying both sides of the equation ([\ref=maineq]) by [formula] and integrating over Ω, we conclude that

[formula]

Let us fix a = 1. Then there exist some constants [formula] such that

[formula]

and

[formula]

We also see that there exists δε,1∈(1,2) such that

[formula]

and there exists a constant c0 > 0 such that

[formula]

Hence we also have

[formula]

Let ν be an exterior unit normal vector to [formula]. By using [formula] and ([\ref=uppnor]), we see that

[formula]

The same argument with minor changes shows that we can find constants δε,2∈(1,2) and c1 > 0 such that

[formula]

Moreover, there exist constants c2,c3 > 0 such that

[formula]

and

[formula]

The desired conclusion follows by using ([\ref=deltaepminus1]), ([\ref=deltaepplus1]), ([\ref=deltaepminus2]) and ([\ref=deltaepplus2]).

Let us recall the following form of the Harnack inequality which will be widely used in the sequel (see [\cite=BT] and [\cite=GT]).

Let [formula] be a smooth bounded domain and v satisfy:

[formula]

with f∈Lp(D), p > 1. For any subdomain D'  ⊂    ⊂  D, there exist two positive constants σ∈(0,1) and γ > 0, depending on D' only such that:

[formula]

[formula]

Moreover, we have the following lemmas.

Let [formula] be a sequence of solutions of ([\ref=maineq]). Let K be a compact subset such that [formula]. Then there exist constants a,b > 0 such that [formula] for any r > 0 and [formula].

By using the Green's representation formula for a solution [formula] of ([\ref=maineq]), we see that for [formula],

[formula]

Then,

[formula]

In view of Lemma [\ref=bddofintegration], we see that

[formula]

For fixed r > 0, we assume that [formula]. By the mean value theorem, there exists θ  =  θ(ε,y)∈(0,1) such that

[formula]

For any [formula], we have [formula] and [formula]. Thus, we see that

[formula]

At this point, Lemma [\ref=bddofintegration] implies that

[formula]

We also see that

[formula]

Therefore we conclude that

[formula]

and we readily obtain constants a,b > 0 such that for any r > 0, it holds

[formula]

Let K be a connected compact set such that [formula]. Suppose that there exists a sequence of solutions [formula] of ([\ref=maineq]) such that

[formula]

Then, we have [formula] as [formula].

Choose a sequence of points [formula] such that [formula]. Passing to a subsequence (still denoted by [formula]), we may assume that [formula]. We argue by contradiction. Suppose that there exists a positive constant cK > 0 and a sequence [formula] such that [formula] for small ε > 0. We will use the constant [formula] obtained in Lemma [\ref=bddofintegration]. If [formula] then, by using Lemma [\ref=propertyofentiresolution], we can choose s1 < 0 such that

[formula]

If [formula] then, by using Lemma [\ref=propertyofentiresolution], we can choose s1 > 0 such that

[formula]

We can also choose [formula] such that [formula] by the intermediate value theorem. Let [formula] for [formula] where K1 is a compact subset such that [formula]. Then [formula] satisfies

[formula]

By using Lemma [\ref=green], we see that [formula] is bounded in [formula]. Passing to a subsequence, we may assume that [formula] converges in [formula] to a function u* which is a solution of

[formula]

By using Lemma [\ref=green] and Lemma [\ref=radiallysymm], we conclude that u* is radially symmetric with respect to some point [formula] in [formula] and u* does not change sign. Hence Lemma [\ref=propertyofentiresolution] shows that

[formula]

which is the desired contradiction. Therefore, [formula].

As a corollary of Lemma [\ref=uniformestimates], we obtain the following proposition.

Let [formula] be a sequence of solutions of ([\ref=maineq]). Then, up to subsequences, one of the following holds true:

(a) [formula] uniformly on any compact subset of [formula];

(b) for any compact subset [formula], there exists νK > 0 such that

[formula]

(c) for any compact subset [formula], there exists νK > 0 such that

[formula]

In view of Lemma [\ref=uniformestimates], it suffices to show that (a) holds whenever both (b) and (c) fail to hold. Suppose that (b) and (c) do not hold. Then, we can take compact sets [formula] and sequences {x1,ε}  ⊂  K1, {x2,ε}  ⊂  K2 such that For any compact set [formula], taking a connected compact set [formula] such that and using the intermediate value theorem, we can obtain a sequence {xε}  ⊆   satisfying Hence, Lemma [\ref=uniformestimates] yields that [formula], which completes the proof.

The proof of Theorem [\ref=BrezisMerletypealternatives] completed. First of all, we assume that (b) in Proposition [\ref=alternatives] holds. In this case, we also suppose that there exists [formula] such that [formula] when i  ≠  j and [formula]. By using [formula] and the intermediate value theorem, we see that there exists [formula] such that [formula] as [formula]. Let [formula] be the limit point of [formula]. Passing to a subsequence, only one of the following two possibilities can be satisfied: either x0∉Z1 or x0∈Z1.

Case 1: x0∉Z1.

Let us fix a constant [formula]. Since [formula] and in particular [formula], then, in view of Lemma [\ref=uniformestimates], we see that [formula]. This is a contradiction since we are assuming that Proposition [\ref=alternatives] (b) holds.

Case 2: x0∈Z1.

For the sake of simplicity, we assume that x0 = 0∈Z1. Since we are assuming that Proposition [\ref=alternatives] (b) holds, then there exists γ > 0 such that [formula]. By the maximum principle, we see that [formula]. We claim that

[formula]

We argue by contradiction and suppose that [formula]. Hence, passing to a subsequence, we could assume that [formula] for some constant c > 0 and small ε > 0. Note that [formula] near x = 0 for some smooth function [formula] and 1  ≤  j  ≤  d1. Let [formula] for [formula]. Then [formula] satisfies

[formula]

We also observe that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Since [formula] and [formula], then for any p > 1 and R > 0, there exists a constant Cp,R > 0 such that [formula]. By using ([\ref=uppharnark]), ([\ref=lowharnk]), and Lemma [\ref=harnarkineq], we see that for large R > 0, there exist σ∈(0,1) and γ > 0, independent of ε > 0, such that

[formula]

Hence [formula] is bounded in [formula]. Passing to a subsequence, we may assume that [formula], [formula], and [formula] converges in [formula] to a function [formula] satisfying

[formula]

Then the function [formula] satisfies

[formula]

Since [formula], we have c0 > 0 and since [formula], we have [formula] by the strong maximum principle. This is of course a contradiction and ([\ref=limxee]) is proved.

At this point, let us fix a constant s2 < 0 such that [formula] (see ([\ref=defbetas]) and Lemma [\ref=bddofintegration]) and -  γ < s2 < 0. We can choose [formula] on a line segment joining [formula] to [formula] such that [formula] and [formula] by the intermediate value theorem. Let [formula] on [formula]. We note that [formula]. Then [formula] satisfies

[formula]

By using the fact that [formula] and [formula] together with Lemma [\ref=harnarkineq], then we see that for large R > 0 there exist σ∈(0,1) and γ > 0, independent of ε > 0, such that

[formula]

and [formula] is bounded in [formula]. Then [formula] converges in [formula] to a function u* satisfying

[formula]

By using Lemma [\ref=radiallysymm], we see that u* is radially symmetric about some point. Then, we see that [formula] from Lemma [\ref=propertyofentiresolution] which is once more a contradiction.

At this point, by using the above results, we see that [formula] for some constant c > 0, which shows that (b) in Theorem [\ref=BrezisMerletypealternatives] holds whenever (b) in Proposition [\ref=alternatives] holds. The proof of (c) in Theorem [\ref=BrezisMerletypealternatives] follows essentially by the same argument and we skip it here to avoid repetitions. [formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=stable]: stable solution ⇒   topological solution

In this section, we will prove one of the implications in the statement of Theorem [\ref=stable], that is, stable solution ⇒   topological solution whenever (H1-2) hold. Let [formula] be a sequence of stable solutions of ([\ref=maineq]). To prove Theorem [\ref=stable], we argue by contradiction and suppose that [formula] does not converge to 0 almost everywhere. Then either (b) or (c) of Theorem [\ref=BrezisMerletypealternatives] would occur. Since [formula], without loss of generality we can assume that [formula] has the profile (b) of Theorem [\ref=BrezisMerletypealternatives].

If [formula] has a bubble at some point in [formula], then there are two possibilities. One is that the limiting equation is the mean field equation and it is easy to see the solution is not stable. Another one is that the limiting equation is ([\ref=maineq]), but defined in the whole [formula], and after a suitable scaling, [formula] tends to a nontopological solution u such that lim |x|  →    ∞u(x) =  -   ∞  . Again, this is also unstable. The proof is not difficult. But for the sake of completeness, we put the proof in the Appendix. To the best of our knowledge, even for CSH ([\ref=chseq]), this result has not been written in the literature.

Therefore, from now on, we may assume that for any small r > 0, there exists cr > 0 such that

[formula]

Now we consider

[formula]

To derive a contradiction, we want to prove that for small ε > 0,

[formula]

To prove ([\ref=eigen]), we need to compute the integral over a small neighborhood of each pj,2∈Z2. Let us first show a simple fact about [formula].

[formula] satisfies

[formula]

Moreover, for any small r > 0, there exists Cr > 0 such that

[formula]

We note that [formula] satisfies the following equation

[formula]

We also see that

[formula]

By using ([\ref=oriassm]) and Lemma [\ref=harnarkineq], we readily obtain ([\ref=nablabdd1]).

Next, by using the Green's representation formula for a solution [formula] of ([\ref=eqforwe]), we see that for x∈Ω,

[formula]

By using Lemma [\ref=bddofintegration], we conclude that there exists a constant C > 0, independent of ε > 0 and r > 0, such that for [formula], it holds

[formula]

By using ([\ref=oriassm]) and Lemma [\ref=bddofintegration], we obtain ([\ref=nablabdd]) which concludes the proof of our lemma.

If [formula], then there exists a function w satisfying By using Lemma [\ref=bddofintegration], we also see that w satisfies

[formula]

If [formula], then for fixed [formula], and by using ([\ref=nablabdd]), we see that there exists a function g satisfying and

[formula]

Clearly ([\ref=inftyftn]) implies [formula].

Next we have the following property.

For any 1  ≤  j  ≤  d2,

[formula]

and

[formula]

where [formula].

For the sake of simplicity, we assume that pj,2 = 0. We consider the following two cases.

Case 1. [formula] We integrate ([\ref=eqforwe]) on Br(0) and take the limit as [formula] to conclude that Clearly Lemma [\ref=bddofintegration] implies that

At this point we consider the function [formula] which satisfies

[formula]

Multiplying ([\ref=eqforv]) by [formula] and integrating over Br(0), we conclude that

[formula]

Let us also consider the function [formula] which satisfies

[formula]

Multiplying ([\ref=eqforve]) by [formula] and integrating over Br(0), we have

[formula]

Hence, as [formula], we have By using ([\ref=pov]), we also see that which is ([\ref=poeqforftwotau]).

Case 2. [formula] We integrate ([\ref=eqforwe]) on Br(0) and take the limit as [formula] to conclude that

Let us consider the function [formula]. Then h satisfies

[formula]

Next we also define [formula] which satisfies

[formula]

Multiplying ([\ref=eqforvehe]) by [formula] and integrating over Br(0), we see that By using ([\ref=pov2]), we also conclude that which is ([\ref=poeqforftwotau1]).

Let [formula] which satisfies

[formula]

Moreover we have:

There exists a constant c > 0, independent of r > 0 and ε > 0, such that

[formula]

For the sake of simplicity, we assume that pj,2 = 0. By using the Green's representation formula for a solution [formula] of ([\ref=maineq]) (see ([\ref=greenrp])) and Lemma [\ref=bddofintegration], we see that for x∈Br(0), for some constants C, C' > 0, independent of r > 0 and ε > 0. The desired conclusion follows by the substitution [formula].

As mentioned above, we have to study the behavior of [formula] as [formula]. This is most delicate part of our proof. Here, the Pohozaev identity ([\ref=poeqforftwotau]) is used.

If τ = 1 or mj,2∈[0,1], then for any η > 0,

[formula]

Moreover, if [formula], then ([\ref=numberforlemma]) always holds without any further assumptions for τ and mj,2.

For the sake of simplicity, we assume that pj,2 = 0. We divide the proof of our lemma in two steps.

Step 1. We claim that for any η > 0, there exists cη > 0 such that for small ε > 0,

[formula]

We argue by contradiction and suppose that there exists η0 > 0 such that Since [formula] is locally bounded in [formula], we also see that

[formula]

Fix c∈( -   ∞  ,0) and [formula]. Since [formula], then ([\ref=supp]) implies that there exists [formula] such that [formula] where [formula] and

[formula]

In view of ([\ref=gradgrad]), we see that the function [formula] satisfies

[formula]

for some constant C1 > 0. Then [formula] is uniformly bounded in [formula] and there exists a function ūi such that [formula] in [formula] and

[formula]

By using Lemma [\ref=radiallysymm], we see that ūi is radially symmetric with respect to some point i in [formula] and ūi does not change sign. Hence Lemma [\ref=bddofintegration] and Lemma [\ref=propertyofentiresolution] together imply that there exists a large R > 0 such that [formula]. Then, which is a contradiction. Therefore ([\ref=prove]) holds as claimed.

Moreover, by using ([\ref=oriassm]), ([\ref=prove]) and the maximum principle, we obtain

[formula]

Step 2. To prove our lemma, we argue by contradiction and suppose that [formula] is uniformly bounded in [formula]. Then, since [formula] and by using ([\ref=gradgrad]) and ([\ref=uppboundd]), we see that there exists a function û such that [formula] in [formula] and

[formula]

for some constant C > 0. Let [formula]. Then we obtain

[formula]

In view of ([\ref=limitlimit]), we also see that we cannot have lim |x|  →    ∞û(x) > 0. Moreover, since [formula] and [formula], then we see that

[formula]

Indeed, if there exists a sequence [formula] such that,

[formula]

then since [formula], there exist small r0 > 0 and c0 > 0, independent of n, such that

[formula]

Then [formula] which proves ([\ref=eitheror]).

If lim |x|  →    ∞û(x) = 0, then ([\ref=oriassm]) and the maximum principle imply that there exist cτ > 0 and R0 > 0 such that

[formula]

which implies that

[formula]

In view of [formula], ([\ref=poeqforftwotau]) and ([\ref=eq1212]), we also see that, for any R∈(R0,  ∞  ), we have

[formula]

Since lim |x|  →    ∞û(x) = 0, we see that

[formula]

which shows that the right hand side of ([\ref=contrafrompo]) could be arbitrarily large, which is impossible. Hence the first case in ([\ref=eitheror]) cannot occur.

If lim |x|  →    ∞û(x) =  -   ∞  , then in view of ([\ref=oriassm]) and the maximum principle, there exists R0 > 0 such that

[formula]

By using Lemma [\ref=intfandcapf] and ([\ref=strictlylessinfty]), we see that Hence we conclude that and in particular that

[formula]

By using ([\ref=limitlimit]) and lim |x|  →    ∞û(x) =  -   ∞  , we see that [formula] and then

[formula]

At this point, the method of moving planes can be used together with ([\ref=lnx2]) to prove that û is radially symmetric (see [\cite=ChL] [\cite=GNN]). Moreover, ([\ref=lnx1]) and ([\ref=lnx2]) imply that

[formula]

If [formula], then ([\ref=rangeforbetainfty]) contradicts ([\ref=betajbddminusone]). Moreover, if τ = 1 or mj,2∈[0,1], then Theorem 3.4 in [\cite=CHLL] imply that û cannot be stable solution, which yields a contradiction and completes the proof of our lemma.

If

[formula]

then

[formula]

Moreover, mj,2  +  βj,2 = 0.

For the sake of simplicity, we assume that pj,2 = 0. We divide the proof of our lemma in the following steps.

Step 1. To prove ([\ref=anotherclaim]), we argue by contradiction and suppose that for some constant c∈( -   ∞  ,0), there exists [formula] such that [formula]. In view of ([\ref=oriassm]), ([\ref=gradgrad]) and ([\ref=as1]), we see that

[formula]

Moreover, by using ([\ref=gradgrad]), we see that the function [formula] satisfies for some constant C1 > 0. Then [formula] is uniformly bounded in [formula] and there exists a function ū such that [formula] in [formula] and By using Lemma [\ref=radiallysymm], we conclude that ū is a nontopological radially symmetric solution. Then Theorem 3.4 in [\cite=CHLL] shows that ū cannot be a stable solution which proves ([\ref=anotherclaim]).

Step 2. By using Lemma [\ref=intfandcapf] and ([\ref=anotherclaim]) we see that

[formula]

which implies To prove our lemma, we argue by contradiction and suppose that

[formula]

which implies

[formula]

If [formula], then ([\ref=betageminus1]) contradicts βj,2 >  - 1 in ([\ref=betajbddminusone]), and we obtain that mj,2  +  βj,2 = 0 in this case.

Therefore, from now on, we assume that

[formula]

Then ([\ref=as1]) and ([\ref=assuminlemma]) imply that for any r,η > 0,

[formula]

Step 3. We claim that for any r,η > 0,

[formula]

Let us choose [formula] such that

[formula]

We consider the function [formula]. Then [formula] satisfies Moreover,

[formula]

To prove the claim ([\ref=claimbounderycond2]), we argue by contradiction and consider the following two cases.

Case 1: Suppose that

[formula]

Then we see that, in view of ([\ref=claimbounderycond00]), we have [formula] and [formula].

Moreover, we see that

[formula]

In view of ([\ref=upb]), we see that for any [formula],

[formula]

By using ([\ref=anotherclaim]) and [formula], we also see that

[formula]

Let [formula] for [formula]. For small ε,δ > 0, [formula] satisfies By using ([\ref=upb2]), we see that

[formula]

In view of ([\ref=L0]), we also conclude that [formula] and for small ε > 0,

[formula]

By using ([\ref=forharnkeq]), ([\ref=forharnkeq2]), and Lemma [\ref=harnarkineq], we see that for any p > 1 and R > 0, there exist constants σ∈(0,1) and γ > 0, depending on R > 0 only such that

[formula]

which implies that [formula] is bounded in [formula]. Then there exists a functon w* such that [formula] in [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=bddofintegration], w* satisfies However we see that w* cannot be a stable solution, which yields the desired contradiction and rules out Case 1.

Case 2: Suppose that there exists c > 0 such that

[formula]

Then, in view of ([\ref=claimbounderycond00]), we see that [formula] and [formula]. By using ([\ref=upb]) and ([\ref=ha0]), we also conclude that

[formula]

By using ([\ref=anotherclaim]) and [formula], we also have

[formula]

Then ([\ref=L0']) implies that for small ε > 0,

[formula]

By using ([\ref=ha1]), ([\ref=ha2]), and Lemma [\ref=harnarkineq], we see that for any p > 1 and δ > 0, there exist constants σ∈(0,1) and γ > 0, depending only on δ > 0 such that which implies that [formula] is bounded in [formula]. Let

[formula]

In view of Lemma [\ref=bddofintegration], we see that there exists a function w* such that [formula] in [formula] and However, w* cannot be a stable solution, which yields once more a contradiction and concludes the proof of ([\ref=claimbounderycond2]) as claimed.

Step 4. For any d∈(0, - (mj,2  +  βj,2)), there exists [formula] such that

[formula]

Now we claim that

[formula]

By using ([\ref=anotherclaim]) and ([\ref=claimbounderycond2]), we see that [formula] and [formula]. Let us consider the function [formula] which satisfies

[formula]

We claim that for any δ > 0, there exists Cδ > 0 such that

[formula]

By using the Green's representation formula for a solution [formula] of ([\ref=maineq]) and Lemma [\ref=bddofintegration], we see that [formula], By the mean value theorem, there exists θ  =  θ(ε,y)∈(0,1) such that

[formula]

For any [formula], we have [formula] for i = 1,2. Then by using Lemma [\ref=bddofintegration] and ([\ref=forenqq]), we see that

[formula]

By using the fact that [formula] for i = 1,2 for any [formula] together with Lemma [\ref=bddofintegration] and ([\ref=forenqq]), we also have

[formula]

Moreover, by using ([\ref=anotherclaim]) and ([\ref=claimbounderycond2]), we see that

[formula]

At this point, ([\ref=difflessfi]) follows by using ([\ref=fofclaim1]), ([\ref=fofclaim2]), and ([\ref=fofclaim3]).

Now we fix [formula]. Then, in view of ([\ref=claimbounderycond2]), ([\ref=new]) and ([\ref=difflessfi]), we see that there exists a function h such that [formula] in [formula] and

[formula]

We also conclude that the function v(x) = h(x) + 2(mj,2 + d) ln |x| satisfies

[formula]

We consider the function [formula] which satisfies

[formula]

Let [formula]. Then, we see that

[formula]

Multiplying ([\ref=preeq]) by [formula] and integrating over [formula], we conclude that

[formula]

Hence ([\ref=claimbounderycond2]) and ([\ref=forfutu]) together imply

[formula]

and we complete the proof of our claim ([\ref=poeqnewclaim]). At this point, in view of ([\ref=anotherclaim]), ([\ref=new]) and ([\ref=poeqnew]), we see that which implies d + 2mj,2 = 2. Since d > 0 can be chosen arbitrarily, we obtain a contradiction which concludes the proof of mj,2  +  βj,2 = 0 under the assumption ([\ref=as1]).

It turns out that Lemma [\ref=minusinftyintheregion] and Lemma [\ref=mplusbetaeq0] yield the following result. Suppose that [formula] is uniformly bounded in any compact subset of [formula] and [formula] converges to w in [formula] as [formula], then 0  ≤  mj,2 < 1 for 1  ≤  j  ≤  d2, N1 > N2, and w satisfies

[formula]

During the preparation of our paper, we was informed by professors Choe and Han that they have proved a similar result, see [\cite=CH].

At this point, we are ready to prove one part of Theorem [\ref=stable].

Proof for Theorem [\ref=stable]: stable solution ⇒   topological solution

To prove our theorem, we consider the following cases.

Case 1. If τ = 1, then Lemma [\ref=minusinftyintheregion] and Lemma [\ref=mplusbetaeq0] together imply that for any r,η > 0,

[formula]

By using ([\ref=mplbetaeazero]) and Lemma [\ref=intfandcapf], we see that

[formula]

If [formula], then in view of ([\ref=inftyftn]) and ([\ref=mplbetaeazero]), we see that thus N1 = N2 which contradicts (H1).

On the other hand, if [formula], then in view of ([\ref=nextforeigenvalue]) and ([\ref=as3]), we see that which implies [formula] for small ε > 0. Then [formula] cannot be a stable solution of ([\ref=maineq]) which is once more a contradiction.

Case 2. If N2 > N1 then, in view of (H2), we have mj,2∈[0,1] for all 1  ≤  j  ≤  d2. Then by using Lemma [\ref=minusinftyintheregion] and Lemma [\ref=mplusbetaeq0] we obtain ([\ref=mplbetaeazero]). By using the same arguments as in Case 1, we can prove that [formula] cannot be stable solution of ([\ref=maineq]). We skip the details of this part to avoid repetitions.

Case 3. If N2 < N1, then we define the following set

[formula]

If J0  =  {1,...,d2}, then the desired conclusion will follow by the same argument adopted in Case 1. Therefore we suppose that J0  ≠  {1,...,d2} and define [formula]. By using Lemma [\ref=minusinftyintheregion], we see that [formula]. Then by ([\ref=inftyftn]), we have

[formula]

By using Lemma [\ref=mplusbetaeq0], we see that there exists j0∈J1 such that

[formula]

For the sake of simplicity, we assume that pj0,2 = 0. In view of Lemma [\ref=intfandcapf], we see that Since j0∈J1, the same argument adopted in the proof of Lemma [\ref=minusinftyintheregion] shows that there exists a function û such that [formula] in [formula] and Let

[formula]

Then we conclude that

[formula]

Moreover, by using ([\ref=oriassm]) and ([\ref=limlnminustwo]), then the similar argument adopted in Step 1 in the proof of Lemma [\ref=mplusbetaeq0] shows that there exist ν and R0 > 0 such that

[formula]

Let [formula]. Then [formula] satisfies

[formula]

Then ([\ref=hatbeta]), ([\ref=limlnminustwo]), ([\ref=strictlylessinftylater]) and ([\ref=eq]) together imply that there exists σ > 0 such that for large ρ > 0,

[formula]

We claim that there exists a constant C > 0 such that

[formula]

Indeed, since j0∈J1 and in view of ([\ref=prove]), we see that [formula] is uniformly bounded in [formula]. Then we have Then, by using ([\ref=strictlylessinftylater]) and the similar argument adopted in Step 3 in the proof of Lemma [\ref=mplusbetaeq0], we conclude that

[formula]

Moreover, by using the Green's representation formula for a solution [formula] of ([\ref=maineq]) and by arguing as in the proof of ([\ref=difflessfi]), we obtain ([\ref=difffinite]). In view of ([\ref=ineq]) and ([\ref=difffinite]) we can find a constant c > 0 such that

[formula]

Now we see that Moreover, the method of moving planes to be used together with ([\ref=limlnminustwo]) shows that û is radially symmetric (see [\cite=ChL] [\cite=GNN]). Now by using Theorem 3.4 in [\cite=CHLL] and  > 0, we see that û cannot be stable solution.

At this point, we complete the proof of one part of Theorem [\ref=stable]: stable solution ⇒   topological solution under the assumptions (H1-2). [formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=stable]: topological solution ⇒   strictly stable solution

In this section, we prove the other implication in the statement of Theorem [\ref=stable], that is, topological solution ⇒   strictly stable solution. We assume that [formula] is a sequence of topological solutions of ([\ref=maineq]) with a sequence ε > 0. Although we use arguments similar to those in [\cite=T1], we still need to carry out a subtle analysis to control the solution's sign changes.

Let [formula] be a sequence of topological solutions of ([\ref=maineq]) with ε > 0. Then, as [formula], we have

(i) [formula] in [formula] for any [formula] and faster than any power of ε;

(ii) [formula], weakly in the sense of measures in Ω.

Let [formula]. In view of Theorem [\ref=BrezisMerletypealternatives] we have [formula] uniformly on any compact subset of [formula] as [formula]. Then we see that for any small δ > 0,

[formula]

since [formula] for any [formula]. Moreover, we see that

[formula]

We have the following inequality,

[formula]

By using ([\ref=squareint]), ([\ref=uesq]), ([\ref=ele]), and the mean value theorem, we see that there exists a constant c > 0 such that

[formula]

for small ε > 0. In view of ([\ref=squareint]), ([\ref=nablauesq]), and the mean value theorem, we can find a constant C > 0 such that

[formula]

for small ε > 0. Let [formula] be such that φ = 0 in {x∈Ω | (x,Z)  ≤  δ }, φ = 1 in Ω2δ and [formula]. Since [formula] uniformly on any compact subset of [formula] as [formula], we note that there exists some constant Cδ > 0, independent of ε > 0, such that

[formula]

Next, by using ([\ref=l1]), ([\ref=version2gradbdd]) and ([\ref=explinear]), we conclude that

[formula]

for some constants cδ, Cδ > 0. By a suitable iteration of ([\ref=l1]), ([\ref=usingl1]), and the elliptic estimates, we deduce that (i) holds. In other words, for any small δ > 0 and any [formula], there exists a constant cδ,m,n > 0 such that

[formula]

Moreover, we see that [formula] satisfies

[formula]

For the sake of simplicity, we assume that pj,i = 0. Multiplying ([\ref=maineqq]) by [formula] and integrating over Br(0), we obtain the Pohozaev type identity where [formula]. By using ([\ref=conto0]), we have

[formula]

thus

[formula]

[formula]

for any small r > 0 which concludes the proof of our lemma.

For a solution [formula] of ([\ref=maineq]), let

[formula]

and [formula] be the corresponding first eigenfunction with [formula] in Ω and [formula],

[formula]

and

[formula]

We note that [formula] is bounded from below:

[formula]

To prove Theorem [\ref=stable], we argue by contradiction and suppose that, along a subsequence (still denoted in the same way), we have a sequence of topological solutions [formula] of ([\ref=maineq]) with a sequence ε > 0 such that

[formula]

In view of (i) of Lemma [\ref=speedofconvergence] and ([\ref=lesszero]), we have the following lemma.

There exists pj0,i0∈Z and r0 > 0 such that for any r∈(0,r0), there exists a constant ar > 0 such that

[formula]

Suppose that there exists a small r > 0 such that

[formula]

Then By using (i) of Lemma [\ref=speedofconvergence], we see that

[formula]

Next, by using ([\ref=lesszero]), ([\ref=notpeak]) and ([\ref=outside2]), we see that This is the desired contradiction which concludes the proof of our lemma.

Since fτ(u) =  - fτ- 1( - u) / τ3, we can assume without loss of generality that i0 = 2, pj0,i0 = 0, and [formula] in Lemma [\ref=forblowup]. We consider the scaled function

[formula]

Then [formula] satisfies

[formula]

Now we have the following lemma.

[formula], where u is a topological solution of

[formula]

We decompose

[formula]

Then [formula] satisfies

[formula]

By using Lemma [\ref=speedofconvergence], [formula] and the maximum principle, we conclude that there exists c > 0 such that for small ε > 0,

[formula]

In view of ([\ref=decomposehatu]) and ([\ref=zerolesslarger]), we have

[formula]

By using the Green's representation formula for a solution [formula] of ([\ref=maineq]) (see ([\ref=greenrp]) and ([\ref=gradgrad])), we see that there exists c0 > 0 such that

[formula]

We claim that [formula] is uniformly bounded in the C2,α topology. To prove our claim, we argue by contradiction and suppose that there exists R0 > 0 such that [formula]. Then ([\ref=gradgrad2]) implies that [formula] for any R  ≥  R0. Clearly Lemma [\ref=speedofconvergence] shows that, for any R  ≥  R0,

[formula]

Since the right hand side of ([\ref=large]) could be arbitrarily large, we obtain a contradiction which proves our claim.

Then we obtain a subsequence [formula] (still denoted in the same way) such that

[formula]

Let us define [formula]. In view of ([\ref=gradgrad2]), Lemma [\ref=bddofintegration] and Lemma [\ref=speedofconvergence], we see that u satisfies ([\ref=u]). Since [formula] and [formula], we see that u is a topological solution in [formula]. Moreover, by using a Pohozaev type identity (see Lemma [\ref=speedofconvergence]), we have

[formula]

Now we claim that a stronger convergence property holds, namely

[formula]

In view of ([\ref=convergencevep]), we have

[formula]

We also see that At this point Lemma [\ref=speedofconvergence], ([\ref=intr]), and the dominated convergence theorem together imply that

[formula]

By using ([\ref=u]), ([\ref=zerolesslarger]), ([\ref=gradgrad2]), ([\ref=est1]), and ([\ref=est3]), we obtain the desired conclusion.

At this point, we are ready to prove Theorem [\ref=stable].

Proof for Theorem [\ref=stable]: topological solution ⇒   strictly stable solution

In view of the strong convergence property as stated in Lemma [\ref=linfty], we can deduce information about the limiting problem of the linearized equation of ([\ref=maineq]) at [formula]. With this purpose, we define

[formula]

Then we have

[formula]

and [formula] for some constant C > 0. By using standard elliptic estimates, we see that [formula] is uniformly bounded in the [formula] topology. Hence, by passing to a subsequence (still denoted in the same way), we see that there exists [formula] such that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Since u has exponential decay at infinity, then [formula] has exponentially decay at infinity. Hence by Lemma [\ref=linfty], we see that for some δ0 > 0. Hence by using ([\ref=defpsie]), ([\ref=psieeq]), and Lemma [\ref=forblowup], we can prove that for large R > 0, which implies [formula] (see Lemma 4.15 in [\cite=T1] for further details). On the other side, by arguing as in Proposition 4.16 in [\cite=T1], we see that the problem ([\ref=psieq]) admits only the trivial solution and we obtain a contradiction. This observation concludes the proof of Theorem [\ref=stable]: topological solution ⇒   strictly stable solution. [formula]

Uniqueness of stable solution

In this section, we deduce Theorem [\ref=uniqueness] from Theorem [\ref=stable].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=uniqueness] The existence of stable solution can be proved by well known monotone iteration schemes and therefore we will skip it here. Hence, to prove Theorem [\ref=uniqueness], it suffices to prove the uniqueness property. We argue by contradiction and suppose that there exist two sequences of distinct stable solutions uε,1 and uε,2 of ([\ref=maineq]). From Theorem [\ref=stable], up to the extraction of subsequences, we have uε,i  →  0 uniformly in any compact subset of [formula] as [formula] for i = 1,2. Since uε,1 - uε,2 is not identically zero, we can define [formula] which satisfies

[formula]

where [formula] is some real number between uε,1 and uε,2. By using the proof of Lemma [\ref=forblowup], we see that there exist pj0,i0∈Z and r0 > 0 such that for any r∈(0,r0), there exists a constant ar > 0 such that

[formula]

Since fτ(u) =  - fτ- 1( - u) / τ3, we can assume without loss of generality that i0 = 2, pj0,i0 = 0, and [formula]. We consider the scaled function

[formula]

In view of Lemma [\ref=linfty], we obtain

[formula]

where ui is a topological solution of

[formula]

Moreover, we can apply the method of moving planes (see [\cite=GNN] [\cite=H]) to conclude that ui is radially symmetric about the origin. Since radially symmetric and topological solutions are unique (see [\cite=CHLL]), we conclude that u1 = u2 in [formula]. Let us set [formula]. We can find ψ̂ such that

[formula]

and By arguing as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=stable] (see Section 5), we see that [formula]. Then,

[formula]

Then Lemma [\ref=linfty] shows that the infimum of ([\ref=infweight]) is attained at some [formula] satisfying At this point Theorem 3.4 in [\cite=CHLL] shows that μ* < 0. However, by arguing as in Proposition 4.16 in [\cite=T1], we can show that [formula] which is the desired contradiction. Therefore there exists a unique stable solution of ([\ref=maineq]) for sufficiently small ε > 0. [formula]

Appendix

In this section, we discuss nontopological solutions of the following equation:

[formula]

As we mentioned in Section 4, we need to analyze a solution [formula] of ([\ref=maineq]), such that [formula] has a bubble at some point in [formula] and [formula] (after a suitable scaling) tends to a nontopological solution u of ([\ref=limitnontopological]). It is not difficult to check that it is enough to our purposes to consider the case [formula]. Concerning this problem, we have the following proposition.

Let u be a solution of ([\ref=limitnontopological]) and [formula]. Then u is unstable.

By using the maximum principle, we always have u < 0. Moreover, if u is radially symmetric, then Theorem 3.4 in [\cite=CHLL] shows that u is unstable. In particular, if ν = 0, then Lemma [\ref=radiallysymm] shows that u is a radially symmetric function. Thus, we only need to prove the instability of u in the case where ν > 0 and u is not radially symmetric. Let us set

[formula]

Then we see that

[formula]

Let [formula]. Since u < 0, we see that [formula] and [formula]. Moreover, by using the results in [\cite=ChL], we obtain the sharper estimate u(x) = ( - β + 2ν) ln |x| + C + O(|x|-  γ), uθ(x) = O(|x|- 1) as |x|  →    +    ∞   where C is a constant and γ is a positive constant. We also note that there exist a local maximum point and a local minimum point of u on each sphere of radius r since u is not radially symmetric. Thus ∂θu changes signs, which implies at least that the first eigenvalue of the linearized equation of ([\ref=maineq]) at u is negative. Therefore we see that u is unstable which was the desired conclusion.
