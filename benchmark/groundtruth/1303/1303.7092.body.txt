Pivotal Estimation in High-dimensional Regression via Linear Programming

CREST (ENSAE), 3 avenue Pierre Larousse, 92 245 Malakoff Cedex, France; ; .

Introduction

In this paper, we consider the linear regression model

[formula]

where xi are random vectors of explanatory variables in [formula], and [formula] is a random error. The aim is to estimate the vector [formula] from n independent, not necessarily identically distributed realizations (yi,xTi), [formula]. We are mainly interested in high-dimensional models where p can be much larger than n under the sparsity scenario where only few components β*k of β* are non-zero (β* is sparse).

The most studied techniques for high-dimensional regression under the sparsity scenario are the Lasso, the Dantzig selector, see, e.g., Candès and Tao (2007), Bickel, Ritov and Tsybakov (2009) (more references can be found in Bühlmann and van de Geer (2011) and Koltchinskii (2011)), and agregation by exponential weighting (see Dalalyan and Tsybakov (2008), Rigollet and Tsybakov (2011, 2012) and the references cited therein). Most of the literature on high-dimensional regression assumes that the random errors are Gaussian or subgaussian with known variance (or noise level). However, quite recently several methods have been proposed which are independent of the noise level (see, e.g., Städler, Bühlmann and van de Geer (2010), Antoniadis (2010), Belloni, Chernozhukov and Wang (2011a, 2011b), Gautier and Tsybakov (2011), Sun and Zhang (2011), Belloni, Chen, Chernozhukov, and Hansen (2012) and Dalalyan (2012)). Among these, the methods of Belloni, Chernozhukov and Wang (2011b), Belloni, Chen, Chernozhukov, and Hansen (2012), Gautier and Tsybakov (2011) allow to handle non-identically distributed errors ui and are pivotal, i.e., rely on very weak distributional assumptions. In Gautier and Tsybakov (2011), the regressors xi can be correlated with the errors ui, and an estimator is suggested that makes use of instrumental variables, called the STIV (Self-Tuned Instrumental Variables) estimator. In a particular instance, the STIV estimator can be applied in classical linear regression model where all regressors are uncorrelated with the errors. This yields a pivotal extension of the Dantzig selector based on conic programming. Gautier and Tsybakov (2011) also present a method to obtain finite sample confidence sets that are robust to non-Gaussian and heteroscedastic errors. Another important issue is to relax the assumptions on the model under which the validity of the Lasso type methods is proved, such as the restricted eigenvalue condition of Bickel, Ritov and Tsybakov (2009) and its various analogs. Belloni, Chernozhukov and Wang (2011b) obtain fast rates for prediction for the Square-root Lasso under a relaxed version of the restricted eigenvalue condition. In the context of known noise variance, Ye and Zhang (2011) introduce cone invertibility factors instead of restricted eigenvalues. For pivotal estimation, an approach based on the sensitivities and sparsity certificates is introduced in Gautier and Tsybakov (2011), see more details below. Finally, note that aggregation by exponential weighting (Dalalyan and Tsybakov (2008), Rigollet and Tsybakov (2011, 2012)) does not require any condition on the model but its numerical realization is based on MCMC algorithms in high dimension whose convergence rate is hard to assess theoretically.

In this paper, we introduce a new pivotal estimator, called the Self-tuned Dantzig estimator. It is defined as a linear program, so from the numerical point of view it is simpler than the previously known pivotal estimators based on conic programming. We obtain upper bounds on its estimation and prediction errors under weak assumptions on the model and on the distribution of the errors showing that it achieves the same rate as in the more restrictive situation of fixed design and i.i.d. Gaussian errors with known variance. The model assumptions are based on the sensitivity analysis from Gautier and Tsybakov (2011). Distributional assumptions allow for dependence between xi and ui. When xi's are independent from ui's, it is enough to assume, for example, that the errors ui are symmetric and have a finite second moment.

Notation

We set [formula], [formula], and we denote by [formula] the matrix of dimension n  ×  p with rows xTi, [formula]. We denote by [formula] the p  ×  p diagonal normalizing matrix with diagonal entries dkk > 0, [formula]. Typical examples are: [formula] or

[formula]

where xki is the kth component of xi. For a vector [formula], let [formula] be its support, i.e., the set of indices corresponding to its non-zero components βk. We denote by |J| the cardinality of a set [formula] and by Jc its complement: [formula]. The [formula] norm of a vector Δ is denoted by |Δ|p, 1  ≤  p  ≤    ∞  . For [formula] and a set of indices [formula], we consider [formula], where [formula] is the indicator function. For [formula], we set [formula], [formula].

The Estimator

We say that a pair [formula] satisfies the Self-tuned Dantzig- constraint if it belongs to the set

[formula]

for some r > 0 (specified below).

Finding the Self-Tuned Dantzig estimator is a linear program. The term cσ is included in the criterion to prevent from choosing σ arbitrarily large. The choice of the constant c will be discussed later.

Sensitivity Characteristics

The sensitivity characteristics are defined by the action of the matrix

[formula]

on the so-called cone of dominant coordinates

[formula]

for some γ > 0. It is straightforward that for δ∈C(γ)J,

[formula]

We now recall some definitions from Gautier and Tsybakov (2011). For q∈[1,   ∞ ], we define the [formula] sensitivity as the following random variable

[formula]

Given a subset [formula] and q∈[1,   ∞ ], we define the [formula]-J0- block sensitivity as

[formula]

By convention, we set [formula]. Also, recall that the restricted eigenvalue of Bickel, Ritov and Tsybakov (2009) is defined by

[formula]

and a closely related quantity is

[formula]

The next result establishes a relation between restricted eigenvalues and sensitivities. It follows directly from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and [\eqref=eq:technical].

[formula]

The following proposition gives a useful lower bound on the sensitivity. Proof. We have

[formula]

Note that the random variable κ(γ)1,0(s) depends only on the observed data. It is not difficult to see that it can be obtained by solving p linear programs. For more details and further results on the sensitivity characteristics, see Gautier and Tsybakov (2011).

Bounds on the estimation and prediction errors

In this section, we use the notation [formula]. Let 0 < α < 1 be a given constant. We choose the tuning parameter r in the definition of [formula] as follows:

[formula]

Proof. Set

[formula]

and define the event

[formula]

Then and the union bound yields

[formula]

We now use the following result on deviations of self-normalized sums due to Efron (1969).

If [formula] are independent symmetric random variables, then

[formula]

For each of the probabilities on the right-hand side of ([\ref=eq:union]), we apply Lemma [\ref=th:efron] with ηi = xkiui. This and the definition of r yield [formula]. Thus, the event G holds with probability at least 1 - α / 2. On the event G we have

[formula]

Inequality [\eqref=eq:Notobvious2] holds because (,) belongs to the set [formula] by definition. Notice that, on the event G, [formula] belongs to the set [formula]. On the other hand, (,) minimizes the criterion [formula] on the same set [formula]. Thus, on the event G,

[formula]

This implies, again on the event G,

[formula]

where β*k,k are the kth components of β*,. Similarly, ([\ref=eq:main]) implies that, on the event G,

[formula]

We now distinguish between the following two cases. Case 1: [formula]. In this case [\eqref=in0] implies

[formula]

Thus, Δ∈C(γ)J(β*) on the event G. By definition of κ(γ)1,J(β*),J(β*) and ([\ref=eq:lb3]),

[formula]

This and [\eqref=stop2b] yield

[formula]

Case 2: [formula]. Then, obviously, [formula]

Combining the two cases we obtain, on the event G,

[formula]

In this argument, c > 0 and γ > 0 were arbitrary. The value of c given in ([\ref=eq:cvalue0]) is the minimizer of the right-hand side of ([\ref=eq:ubDeltaJ]). Plugging it in ([\ref=eq:ubDeltaJ]) we find that, with probability at least 1 - α / 2

[formula]

where we have used [\eqref=in0]. Now, by ([\ref=eq:Qcond]), (β*)  ≤  Q* with probability at least 1 - α / 2. Thus, we get that ([\ref=eq:ub:estim]) holds with probability at least 1 - α. Next, using [\eqref=stop2b] we obtain that, on the same event of probability at least 1 - α,

[formula]

Combining this inequality with ([\ref=eq:ub:estim]) yields ([\ref=eq:ub:predict]). [formula]

Discussion of Theorem [\ref=l11].

In view of Lemma [\ref=lemma1], κ(γ)1,J(β*),J(β*)  ≥  (2 + γ)- 2κ(γ)RE,J(β*) / s. Also, it is easy to see from Proposition [\ref=p1] that κ(γ)1,0(s) is of the order 1 / s when Ψn is the identity matrix and p  ≫  s (this is preserved for Ψn that are small perturbations of the identity). Thus, the bounds ([\ref=eq:ub:estim]) and ([\ref=eq:ub:predict]) take the form

[formula]

for some constant C, and we recover the usual rates for the [formula] estimation and for the prediction error respectively, cf. Bickel, Ritov and Tsybakov (2009).

Theorem [\ref=l11] does not assume that xki's are independent from ui's. The only assumption is the symmetry of xkiui. However, if xki is independent from ui, then by conditioning on xki in the bound for [formula], it is enough to assume the symmetry of ui's. Furthermore, while we have chosen the symmetry since it makes the conditions of Theorem [\ref=l11] simple and transparent, it is not essential for our argument to be applied. The only point in the proof where we use the symmetry is the bound for the probability of deviations of self-normaized sums [formula]. This probability can be bounded in many other ways without the symmetry assumption, cf., e.g., Gautier and Tsybakov (2011). It is enough to have [formula] and a uniform over k control of the ratio

[formula]

for some δ > 0, cf. [\cite=JSW] or [\cite=BGHK2].

The quantity Q* is not present in the definition of the estimator and is needed only to assess the rate of convergence. It is not hard to find Q* in various situations. The simplest case is when [formula] and the random variables xki and ui are bounded uniformly in k,i by a constant L. Then we can take Q* = L4. If only xki are bounded uniformly in k by L, condition ([\ref=eq:Qcond]) holds when [formula] and then for Q* to be bounded it is enough to assume that ui's have a finite second moment. The same remark applies when [formula], with an advantage that in this case we guarantee that Q* is bounded under no assumption on xki.

The bounds in Theorem [\ref=l11] depend on γ > 0 that can be optimized. Indeed, the functions of γ on the right-hand sides of ([\ref=eq:ub:estim]) and ([\ref=eq:ub:predict]) are data-driven and can be minimized on a grid of values of γ. Thus, we obtain an optimal (random) value γ  =  , for which ([\ref=eq:ub:estim]) and ([\ref=eq:ub:predict]) remain valid, since these results hold for any γ > 0.
