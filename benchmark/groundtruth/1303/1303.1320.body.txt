Equidistribution of Hecke points on the supersingular module

Introduction

Let p be a prime number. We denote by [formula] the set of isomorphism classes of supersingular elliptic curves over [formula]. We denote by [formula] the supersingular module in characteristic p (i.e. S is the free abelian group spanned by the elements of E). Hecke operators act on S by

[formula]

where C runs through the subgroup schemes of Ei of rank m. This definition is extended by linearity to S and to [formula]. For an integer m  ≥  1 we put

[formula]

We have that [formula]. The the matrix [formula] is known as the Brandt matrix of order m.

For a given [formula], we put [formula]. We have that ([\cite=Gross], Proposition 2.7)

[formula]

leading to define deg Tm: = σ(m)p.

Let M be the set of probability measures on E. For every [formula], we denote by δEi∈M the Dirac measure supported on Ei. Let

[formula]

For any [formula], we put

[formula]

We have that ΘD is a probability measure on E and every element of M has this form. Hence, there is a natural action of the Hecke operators on M, given by TmΘD: = ΘTmD.

Each Ei has a finite number of automorphisms. We define

[formula]

The element [formula] is Eisenstein ([\cite=Gross], p. 139), i.e.

[formula]

We denote by Θ: = Θe. Equation [\eqref=Eis] implies that TmΘ  =  Θ for all m  ≥  1.

Let [formula] be the space of complex valued functions on E. For f∈C(E), we denote by ||f||  =   max i|f(Ei)| and

[formula]

For a positive integer m, we write m = pkmp with [formula]. In this note, we will prove the following result:

For all [formula], the sequence of measures {ΘTmEi}, where m runs through a set of positive integers such that mp grows to infinity, is equidistributed with respect to Θ. More precisely, for all ε > 0, there exists [formula] such that, for every f∈C(E), and for every sequence of integers m such that mp  →    ∞  , we have that

[formula]

We study the asymptotic frequence of the multiplicity of Ej inside TmEi. That is, we investigate the behavoir of the ratio Bi,j(m) /  deg (Tm) when m varies. We will prove Theorem [\ref=principalIntro] in the equivalent formulation:

For all ε > 0, there exists [formula] such that for every sequence of integers m such that mp  →    ∞  , we have that

[formula]

In particular,

[formula]

The proof of this assertion is found in section [\ref=dems].

The equality [formula] combined with equation [\eqref=principal] implies the mass formula of Deuring and Eichler:

[formula]

Theorem [\ref=principalIntro] can be deduced from Theorem [\ref=principalfino] as follows: remark [\ref=masa] implies that [formula] Take f∈C0(E). We have that

[formula]

Hence, inequality [\eqref=cuantitativo] implies Theorem [\ref=principalIntro].

Let h:E  →  E be a function. Then h defines an endomorphism of S and of [formula] by the rule

[formula]

We will also consider the action induced on M by h*ΘD: = Θh(D).

Let q  ≠  p be a prime number. Let h:E  →  E be a function such that [formula]. Then h*Θ  =  Θ. In other words, h can be identified with a permutation τ∈Sn by h(Ei) = Eτ(i) and we have that wi  =  wτ(i) for all [formula].

Proof: since Tqk is a polynomial in Tq, we also have that [formula]. Let f∈C(E). We have that

[formula]

where we have used Theorem [\ref=principalIntro] in [\eqref=pasouno] and [\eqref=pasodos] [formula]

The statement Theorem [\ref=principalIntro], using the Hecke invariant measure Θ, has been included to emphasize the analogy with the fact that Hecke orbits are equidistributed on the modular curve [formula] with respect to the hyperbolic measure, which is Hecke invariant (e.g. see [\cite=ClozelUllmo], Section 2).

Weight 2 Eisenstein series for Γ0(p)

The modular curve X0(p) has two cusps, represented by 0 and ∞  . We denote by Γ∞ (resp. Γ0) the stabilizer of ∞   (resp. 0). The associated weight 2 Eisenstein series are given by

[formula]

where [formula] and jη(z)  =  cz + d for [formula] .

The functions E∞ and E0 are weight 2 modular forms for Γ0(p) and they are Hecke eigenforms. The Fourier expansions at i  ∞   are ([\cite=Miyake], Theorem 7.2.12, p. 288)

[formula]

with the sequences an and bn given by:

if [formula] then [formula]

if k  ≥  1, then bpk  =  p + 1 - pk + 1 and apk  =  pk

if [formula] and k  ≥  1, then bpkm  =   - bpkbmapkm  =  apkam.

By taking an appropriate linear combination, we obtain a non cuspidal, holomorphic at i  ∞   modular form

[formula]

Since we have that

[formula]

this shows that f is holomorphic at Γ0(p)0 as well. Since

[formula]

and since f is holomorphic, non zero and non cuspidal, we have the decomposition

[formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=principalfino]

Recall that we write m = pkmp with [formula]. We have that B(pk) is a permutation matrix of order dividing 2 and that B(m) = B(pk)B(mp) ([\cite=Gross], Proposition 2.7). It follows that deg (Tm) =  deg (Tmp) and that we can define, for each [formula], an index [formula] such that Bi,l(pk) = δi(k),l. Furthermore, i(k) = i if k is even. We have that

[formula]

Hence, to prove Theorem [\ref=principalfino] we may assume [formula], which is what we will do in what follows.

Our method is based on the interpretation of the multiplicities Bi,j(m) as Fourier coefficients of a modular form.

For every 0  ≤  i,j  ≤  n, there exists a weight 2 modular form fi,j for Γ0(p) such that its q-expansion at ∞   is

[formula]

Proof: this fact is stated in [\cite=Gross], p.118. It is a particular case of [\cite=Eichler], Chapter II, Theorem 1 (D = p,H = 1,l = 0 in Eichler's notation). We remark that the theorem in loc. cit. states modularity of a theta series constructed from an order in a quaternion algebra. The fact that this theta series is the same as our fi,j is a consequence of [\cite=Gross], Proposition 2.3 [formula]

Using [\eqref=sumadirecta], we can decompose

[formula]

Comparing the q-expansions, we get [formula] We have that

[formula]

where

[formula]

The coefficient cm depends on (i,j), but we don't include this dependence in the notation in order to simplify it. Since [formula], we have that deg (Tm)  =  σ1(m) and

[formula]

Hence,

[formula]

Using Deligne's theorem ([\cite=Deligne], théorème 8.2, previously Ramanujan's conjecture), we have that

[formula]
