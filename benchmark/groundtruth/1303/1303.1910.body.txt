A tale of two surfaces

Introduction

The aim of this note is to point out a link between two surfaces which have appeared recently in the literature: the surface of cuboids ([\cite=ST], [\cite=vL]) and the surface (actually a family of surfaces) discovered by Schoen [\cite=S]. We will show that both surfaces give rise to a surface X with q = 4, whose canonical map is 2-to-1 onto a complete intersection of 4 quadrics [formula] with 48 nodes. In the first case (§ 2) X is a quotient [formula], where C and C' are genus 5 curves with a free action of [formula]. In the second case (§ 3), X is a double étale cover of the Schoen surface.

When the canonical map of a surface X of general type has degree > 1 onto a surface, that surface either has pg = 0 or is itself canonically embedded ([\cite=B], Th. 3.1). Our surfaces X provide one more example of the latter case, which is rather exceptional (see [\cite=CPT] for a list of the examples known so far).

The surface of cuboids and its deformations

In [formula], with coordinates (x,y;u,v,w), we consider the curve C given by

[formula]

where a,b,c are quadratic forms in x,y. We assume that the zeros {p'a,p''a;p'b,p''b;p'c,p''c} of a,b,c form a set [formula] of 6 distinct points. Then C is a smooth curve of genus 5, canonically embedded. It is preserved by the group [formula] which acts on [formula] by changing the signs of u,v,w. Let Γ  ⊂  Γ+ be the subgroup (isomorphic to [formula]) which changes an even number of signs. It acts freely on C, so the quotient curve B: = C / Γ has genus 2. The subring of Γ-invariant elements in [formula] is generated by x,y and z: = uvw, with the relation z2 = abc; thus B is the double cover of [formula] branched along Z.

Let JB2 be the group of 2-torsion line bundles on B (isomorphic to [formula]). The Γ-covering π:C  →  B corresponds to a subgroup [formula] of JB2, namely the kernel of π*:JB  →  JC. Since the divisor π*(p'a + p''a) is cut out on C by the canonical divisor u = 0, we have π*(p'a - p''a)  ~  0, and similarly for b and c; thus [formula]. This is a Lagrangian subgroup of JB2 for the Weil pairing [\cite=M2]; conversely, any Lagrangian subgroup of JB2 is of that form. Thus the curves C we are considering are exactly the [formula]-étale covers of a curve B of genus 2 associated to a Lagrangian subgroup of JB2. In particular they form a 3-dimensional family.

The group [formula] acts on B = C / Γ through the hyperelliptic involution, so C / Γ+ is isomorphic to [formula].

Let C,C' be two genus 5 curves of type (1), and let X be the quotient of C  ×  C' by the diagonal action of [formula].

1) X is a minimal surface of general type with q = 4, pg = 7, K2 = 32.

2) The involution iX of X defined by the action of [formula] has 48 fixed points. The canonical map [formula] factors through iX, and induces an isomorphism of X / iX onto a complete intersection of 4 quadrics in [formula] with 48 nodes.

Proof : The computation of the numerical invariants of X is straightforward.

Let us denote by (x',y';u',v',w') the coordinates on C', and by a',b',c' the corresponding quadratic forms. A basis of the space [formula] is given by the elements

[formula]

They satisfy the relations

[formula]

where A,B,C are quadratic forms satisfying [formula] and the analogous relations for B and C.

Let Σ be the surface defined by these 4 quadratic forms, and let φ:X  →  Σ be the induced map. We have [formula], so φ induces a map [formula] from X / iX  =  (C  ×  C') / Γ+ into Σ. We consider the commutative diagram

[formula]

where p:(C  ×  C') / Γ+  →  (C / Γ+)  ×  (C'  /  Γ+) is the quotient map by Γ+, and q the projection [formula]. The group [formula] acts on Σ by changing the signs of (U,V,W); then [formula] is an equivariant map of [formula]-coverings, hence an isomorphism.

It remains to show that iX has 48 fixed points. These fixed points are the images [formula] of the points of C  ×  C' fixed by one of the elements of [formula]. Such an element changes the sign of one of the coordinates [formula] or w, hence fixes the 64 points (m,m') of C  ×  C' with [formula]. This gives (3  ×  64) / 4 = 48 fixed points in X.

Let us take for C and C' the curve

[formula]

The set of zeros of a,b,c is {0,  ∞  ,  ±  1,  ±  i}, so the genus 2 curve B is given by z2 = x(x4 - 1).

We get for Σ the following equations :

[formula]

or, after the linear change of variables [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula]:

[formula]

These are the equations of the surface of cuboids, studied in [\cite=ST], [\cite=vL]. It encodes the relations in a cuboid (= rectangular box) between the sides [formula], the diagonals of the faces [formula], and the big diagonal [formula]. Thus the surface of cuboids belongs to a 6-dimensional family of intersection of 4 quadrics in [formula] with 48 nodes.

The surfaces X fit into a tower of [formula]-étale coverings :

[formula]

The abelian covering r is the pull back of a [formula]-étale covering of JB  ×  JB' :

[formula]

The abelian variety A is the Albanese variety of X, and α is the Albanese map. Since the quotient X / iX is regular, iX acts as ( - 1) on the space H0(X,Ω1X); therefore if we choose α so that it maps a fixed point of iX to 0, iX is induced by ( - 1A).

The Schoen surface

The Schoen surfaces S have been defined in [\cite=S], and studied in [\cite=CMR]. A Schoen surface S is contained in its Albanese variety A; it has the following properties:

a)  K2S = 16 , pg = 5 , q = 4  (hence χ(OS) = 2);

b) The canonical map [formula] factors through an involution iS with 40 fixed points, and induces an isomorphism of S / iS onto the complete intersection of a quadric and a quartic in [formula] with 40 nodes [\cite=CMR].

Since S / iS is a regular surface, iS acts as ( - 1) on the space H0(S,Ω1S). Therefore if we choose the Albanese embedding [formula] so that it maps a fixed point of iS to 0, iS is induced by the involution ( - 1A).

Let [formula] be a line bundle of order 2 on A; we denote by π:B  →  A the corresponding étale double cover, and put X: = π- 1(S). The restriction of [formula] to S, which we will still denote by [formula], is nontrivial (because the restriction map [formula] is an isomorphism), hence X is connected.

X is a minimal surface of general type with q = 4, pg = 7, K2X = 32.

Proof : The formulas K2X = 32 and χ(OX) = 4 are immediate; we must prove q(X) = 4, that is, [formula].

By construction [\cite=S] the Schoen surfaces fit into a flat family over the unit disk Δ:

[formula]

where:

[formula] is a smooth family of abelian varieties;

[formula] at a point z  ≠  0 of Δ, Sz is a Schoen surface, and [formula] is the Albanese embedding;

[formula] for a genus 2 curve C; S0 is the union of JC embedded diagonally in JC  ×  JC, and of C  ×  C  ⊂  JC  ×  JC (we choose an Abel-Jacobi embedding C  ⊂  JC). These two components intersect transversally along the diagonal C  ⊂  C  ×  C.

The line bundle [formula] extends to a line bundle L of order 2 on A. Let [formula] be the restriction of L to S0; we want to compute [formula]. We have an exact sequence

[formula]

The line bundle L0 on JC  ×  JC can be written [formula], where α and β are 2-torsion line bundles on JC, not both trivial; we use the same letters to denote their restriction to C. The cohomology exact sequence associated to ([\ref=ex]) gives

[formula]

The restriction map [formula] is surjective, so u is injective. If α and β are nontrivial, [formula] is zero, and the restriction map [formula] is injective, so [formula]. If, say, β is trivial, H1(JC,α) is zero and the map [formula] is bijective, hence [formula] again.

By semi-continuity this implies H1(Sz,Lz) = 0 for z general in Δ, or equivalently [formula], where [formula] is the étale double covering defined by L. But q is a topological invariant, so this holds for all z  ≠  0 in Δ, hence [formula].

The surface X has a natural action of [formula], given by the involution iX induced by ( - 1B) and the involution τ associated to the double covering X  →  S, which is induced by a translation of B. We want to determine how these involutions act on H0(X,KX). The decomposition of H0(X,KX) into eigenspaces for τ is

[formula]

By property b) above, iS acts trivially on H0(S,KS). It remains to study how it acts on [formula], or equivalently on [formula]. To define this action we choose the isomorphism [formula] over A such that u(0) = 1, and we consider the involutions [formula].

There exist line bundles [formula] of order 2 on A for which iS acts trivially on [formula]. In that case iX has 48 fixed points.

Proof : We will denote by A2 and Â2 the 2-torsion subgroups of A and its dual abelian variety Â, and similarly for B. The fixed point set of iS is [formula], and that of iX is [formula].

We apply the holomorphic Lefschetz formula to the automorphism iS of S and the iS-linearization [formula]:

[formula]

(At a point a of A2, [formula] is the multiplication by a scalar, which we still denote u(a).)

Let a∈A2. By [\cite=M1], property iv) p. 304, we have [formula], where [formula] is the canonical pairing. On the other hand, dualizing the exact sequence of [formula]-vector spaces

[formula]

and using the canonical pairings we get an exact sequence

[formula]

Thus u(a) = 1 if a∈π(B2), and u(a) =  - 1 otherwise. For i = 0 or 1, let fi be the number of points [formula] with [formula]. The right hand side of the Lefschetz formula is [formula].

We have [formula] (Proposition [\ref=q]), hence [formula]. Thus the left hand side is [formula]. Since f0 + f1 = 40 this gives fi∈{16,20,24}; the case f0 = 24 corresponds to H2(iS,u) = 1. Moreover the number of fixed points of iX is [formula]. Thus the Proposition will follow if we can find [formula] in Â2 with f0 = 24.

Put [formula]. Consider the homomorphism [formula] given by [formula]. For [formula], the weight of the element [formula] of [formula] (that is, the number of its nonzero coordinates) is f1, which belongs to {16,20,24}. Therefore j is injective; its image is a 8-dimensional vector subspace of [formula], that is, a linear code, such that the weight of any nonzero vector belongs to {16,20,24}. A simple linear algebra lemma ([\cite=Angers], lemma 1) shows that a code in [formula] of dimension ≥  7 contains elements of weight < 20; thus there exist elements [formula] in Â2 with f1 = 16, hence f0 = 24.

From now on we choose [formula] so that iS acts as trivially on [formula]. Thus iX acts trivially on H0(X,KX) and has 48 fixed points.

The canonical map [formula] factors through iX, and induces an isomorphism of X / iX onto a complete intersection of 4 quadrics in [formula] with 48 nodes.

Proof : Since iX acts as trivially on H0(X,KX), we have a commutative diagram

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] are the canonical maps, Σ and Ξ their images, p the projection corresponding to the injection H0(S,KS)  →  H0(X,KX), pΣ its restriction to Σ.

The map [formula] gives the quotient of X by the action of [formula]. Since τ acts non-trivially on H0(X,KX), [formula] identifies Σ with the quotient X / iX. Thus all the maps in the left hand square of the above diagram are double coverings, étale outside finitely many points. In particular, since K2X = 32, we have deg Σ = 16.

We choose bases [formula] and (u,v) of the ( + 1) and ( - 1)-eigenspaces in H0(X,KX) with respect to τ. The elements u2,uv,v2 of [formula] are invariant under τ and iX, therefore they are pull-back of iS-invariant forms in [formula]. Such a form comes from an element of H0(Ξ,OΞ(2)), hence from an element of [formula]. Thus we have

[formula]

where a,b,c are quadratic forms in [formula]. Moreover the irreducible quadric Q containing Ξ is defined by a quadratic form q(x) which vanishes on Σ.

Thus Σ is contained in the subvariety V of [formula] defined by these 4 quadratic forms. If V is a surface, it has degree 16 and therefore is equal to Σ. Thus it suffices to prove that the morphism [formula] induced by the projection p is not surjective.

Assume that [formula] is surjective; it has degree 2, and we have a cartesian diagram

[formula]

The variety V is irreducible: otherwise Σ is contained in one of its component, which maps birationally to Q, and pΣ has degree 1, a contradiction. Since [formula] is simply connected, pV is branched along a surface R  ⊂  Q. Since Ξ is an ample divisor in Q (cut out by a quartic equation), it meets R along a curve, and pΣ is branched along that curve, a contradiction.

It follows that Ξ = p(Σ) is defined by the equations q(x) = b(x)2 - a(x)c(x) = 0. The 40 nodes of Ξ break into two sets: the 16 points in [formula] defined by a(x) = b(x) = c(x) = q(x) = 0 are the images by pΣ of smooth points of Σ fixed by the involution induced by τ; pΣ is étale over the other 24 nodes of Ξ, giving rise to the 48 nodes of Σ.

The two families of surfaces X that we have constructed are different; in fact, a surface X1 of the first family is not even homeomorphic to a surface X2 of the second one. Indeed X1 admits an irrational genus 2 pencil X  →  B, and this is a topological property [\cite=C]. But for a general member X2 of the second family, the Albanese variety of the corresponding Schoen surface is simple [\cite=S], so its double cover [formula] is also simple; therefore X2 cannot have an irrational pencil of genus 2.

It follows that the corresponding surfaces Σ belong to two different connected components of the moduli space of complete intersections of 4 quadrics in [formula] with an even set of 48 nodes.
