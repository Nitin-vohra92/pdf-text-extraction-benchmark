Rank 2 ACM bundles on Complete intersection Calabi-Yau threefolds

Introduction

Curves and vector bundles on a general threefold [formula] have been considered as an important tool for the description of the geometry of X.

The existence of ACM bundles is linked to the existence of some arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay curves, via Serre corespondence between rank 2 bundles on threefolds and locally complete intersection subcanonical curves (see e.g. [\cite=har3] or [\cite=mad2]).

We will consider smooth Calabi-Yau threefolds, i.e. smooth 3-dimensional projective varieties with trivial canonical class. In particular, if [formula] is a complete intersection of hypersurfaces of degrees d1,...,dk then X is called a CICY threefold. By adjunction formula (see e.g. [\cite=ful]), we obtain the following CICY threefolds:

quintic threefold X5 in [formula],

complete intersection X8 of type (2,4) in [formula]

complete intersection X9 of type (3,3) in [formula]

complete intrersection X12 of type (2,2,3) in [formula],

complete intersection X16 of type (2,2,2,2) in [formula].

Chiantini and Madonna classify ACM rank 2 bundles on a general quintic threefolds [\cite=chi] and prove the existence of some of them. They use the tools of deformation theory from Kley [\cite=kle]. Rao and Kumar prove the existence of all ACM bundles from [\cite=chi], where some of the proofs involve computer calculations. They proved the existence of bundles using the Pfaffian matrix representation of the quintic threefold, so their result cannot be generalized to other CICY threefolds. A list of indecomposable ACM bundles on CICY threefolds is given in Madonna's paper [\cite=mad1], however we believe it is incorrect (see Theorem [\ref=theorem1]).

Recently Knutsen [\cite=knu] and Yu [\cite=yu] explored the existence of smooth isolated curves on CICY threefolds. Their results and the theory of elliptic and canonical curves (see e.g. Babbage [\cite=bab], Eisenbud [\cite=eis], Noether [\cite=noe], Fisher [\cite=fis]) will help us to prove the existence of indecomposable rank 2 bundles on general CICY threefolds.

For the existence of rank 4 indecomposable vector bundles on a quintic threefold see Madonna [\cite=mad3].

The main result of this paper is

Let [formula] (where [formula]) be a CICY threefold and let E be an indecomposable ACM rank 2 vector bundle on it. Then the normalization of E has one of the following Chern classes:

c1 =  - 2, c2 = 1,

c1 =  - 1, c2 = 2,

c1 = 0, 3  ≤  c2  ≤  4 + k,

c1 = 1, 4  ≤  c2  ≤  6 + 2k and c2 is even,

c1 = 2, c2  ≤  7 + 2k + r

c1 = 3, c2 = 8 + 2k + 2r

c1 = 4,

c2 = 30 if r = 5,

c2 = 44 if r = 8,

c2 = 48 if r = 9,

c2 = 62 if r = 12,

c2 = 80 if r = 16.

We prove the existence of E on a general Xr for c1 =  - 2, - 1 and 0, for all possible r and c2 listed above, except c1 = 0, c2 = 3 on X16. There also exists bundles for r = 8 with c1 = 1, c2 = 6 and c1 = 1, c2 = 10; for r = 9 with c1 = 1, c2 = 6 and c1 = 1, c2 = 10; for r = 12 with c1 = 1, c2 = 8 and c1 = 1,c2 = 12.

Section 2 includes definitions, notations, the Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch formula for rank 2 bundle on CICY threefolds and states the Serre corespondence. Our Theorem [\ref=izjave] in Section 3 explicitely relates minimal resolutions of arithmetically Gorenstein curves and the corresponding rank 2 bundles. This is a generalization of Faenzi, Chiantini result [\cite=chifae] for rank 2 bundles on surfaces. In Section 4 we classify bundles using case by case analysis. We obtain some intersesting properties of the corresponding curves and some minimal free resolutions which lead to the proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem1] in Section 5. We also prove the existence of an indecomposable bundle of higher rank on X8.

Generalities

We work over the field of complex numbers. A vector bundle on a projective scheme X is a locally free coherent sheaf on X. We denote by OX the structure sheaf of X and for any vector bundle E we write [formula].

Since Picard group of Xr is isomorphic to [formula] and second Chern class c2(E) is a multiple of the class of a line, we identify Chern classes c1(E), c2(E) and line bundles with integers. We write ci for ci(E). If E is a rank 2 vector bundle on Xr, we have

[formula]

[formula]

The Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch formula (GRR) for a rank 2 bundle E on a CICY threefold Xr is

[formula]

Let h denote the generator of the Picard group and let l be the class of a line. From the Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch formula (see e.g. page 431 in [\cite=har]) we get

[formula]

where ci = ci(E), di = ci(TX), and TX is the tangent sheaf of X. By the adjunction formula ([\cite=ful]) we have d1 = 0 and in case r = 5 we obtain d2 = 10h2, in the case r = 8 we obtain d2 = 7h2, in the case r = 9 we obtain d2 = 6h2, in the case r = 12 we obtain d2 = 5h2 and in the case r = 16 we obtain d2 = 4h2. We have h2 = r  ·  l and after identifying the Chern classes with integers we get [\eqref=gro].

Let IV be the saturated ideal of the closed subscheme V of [formula]. Then V is arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay (ACM) if

[formula]

It holds (see e.g. [\cite=mig]) that if dim V = r  ≥  1, then V is ACM if and only if (Mi)(V) = 0, for 1  ≤  i  ≤  r. Here (Mi)(V) is the deficiency module of V, defined as the i-th cohomology module of the ideal sheaf of V:

[formula]

A locally complete intersection projective variety [formula] is subcanonical if the canonical sheaf ωV is isomorphic to OV(k), for some integer k.

If [formula] is ACM and the last bundle in the minimal free resolution of IV is a line bundle, then we call V arithmetically Gorenstein (AG). Note that an ACM variety V is AG if and only if it is subcanonical. If there exists a variety X  ⊇  V such that the last bundle in the minimal free resolution of IV in X is a line bundle then we say that V is AG in X.

A sheaf E on a k-dimensional projective variety X is arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay (ACM) if hi(E(n)) = 0 for i = 1,...,k - 1 and for all [formula].

We say that a bundle E on X is normalized if the number

[formula]

is equal to zero. Clearly, the normalization of E is E( - b(E)).

The Serre correspondence between bundles and curves (see e.g. [\cite=har3] or [\cite=mad2]) is the following:

. Let X be a smooth 3-dimensional projective variety. A curve C  ⊂  X occurs as the zero-locus of a section of a rank 2 vector bundle E on X, if C is a local complete intersection and subcanonical. More precisely, for any fixed invertible sheaf L on X with [formula], there exists a bijection between the following set of data:

the set of triples (E,s,φ), where s∈H0(X,E) and [formula] is an isomorphism, modulo equivalence relation defined in [\cite=har3].

the set of pairs (C,E), where C is a locally complete intersection curve in X and [formula] and ωC are isomorphic.

A normalized bundle E has a section whose zero locus C is a curve and we have an exact sequence

[formula]

where IC is an ideal sheaf of C on X. The curve C is ACM if and only if E is ACM and C has degree c2(E). Moreover, if X is a Calabi-Yau threefold, the genus of C is [formula].

Minimal resolution of ACM curves on complete intersection threefolds

Let E be a vector bundle of rank 2 on a complete intersection threefold [formula] of type (d1,...,dk). Denote by Yi the complete intersection fourfold of type (d1,..,di - 1,di + 1,...,dk) which contains X and let aj be the degrees of minimal generators for E in Yi. By abuse of notation write E for the sheaf i*E, where [formula]. Clearly, for k = 1 take [formula]. From the Auslander-Buchsbaum formula we get a resolution

[formula]

where [formula] and F is an ACM bundle on Yi.

From now on we will assume that F splits. If Yi is [formula] (which is the case when X is a quintic threefold), then by Horrock's criterion F splits.

After dualising the exact sequence [\eqref=eq:1], we get

[formula]

Indeed, HomOYi(E,OYi) = 0 since the support of E is in X and Exti(F,OYi) = Exti(G,OYi) = 0, for i > 0 by [\cite=har] since F splits.

The same argument as in [\cite=rao2] for a quintic yields that even when Yi is not equal to [formula], we have an isomorphism [formula]. Indeed, applying the functor Hom(E,  ·  ) on the exact sequence

[formula]

we obtain

[formula]

where f is multiplication by the defining polynomial of X in Yi. As above we see that HomOYi(E,OYi) = HomOYi(E,OYi(di)) = 0. Since Ext1OYi(E,OYi) and Ext1OYi(E,OYi(di)) are both supported on X, we obtain an isomorphism

[formula]

Thus we see that resolutions [\eqref=eq:1] and [\eqref=eq:dual] twisted by c1 - di are equivalent resolutions for E. In the case of a quintic threefold Beauville [\cite=bea] showed the existence of a resolution of the following type

[formula]

A similar resolution for CICY threefolds will appear in the following theorem.

Assume that a complete intersection threefold X contains a subcanonical local complete intersection curve C, which is AG in at least one of the Yi. Then the ideal sheaf of C has a minimal resolution

[formula]

where

[formula]

Here [formula] and rj are the degrees of minimal generators of IC,Yi and 2b + 1 is the number of these generators. Assume also that c1(E) = c - di, where E is a normalized rank 2 ACM bundle on X, corresponding to the curve C. Then E has a minimal resolution

[formula]

where

[formula]

[formula]

From now on, we fix the fourfold Yi satisfying the assumptions of Theorem [\ref=izjave] and denote it by Y. We also denote the degree of the defining polynomial of X in Y by d instead of di. Observe that [\eqref=eq:res4] is of the following type

[formula]

By Eisenbud and Buchsbaum [\cite=buceis] every ideal sheaf of an AG curve in Y has a resolution of type [\eqref=eq:3]. From [\eqref=eq:3] we obtain two short exact sequences:

[formula]

[formula]

We also have the following exact sequences:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Let Q be the kernel of the surjective map P0  →  IC,X. Thus we have

[formula]

By the snake lemma applied to [\eqref=2] and [\eqref=6], Q fits into

[formula]

Next, apply [formula] to [\eqref=5]. Since [formula], the map P0  →  IC,X lifts to the map P0  →  E(d - c) and thus we can connect [\eqref=5] and [\eqref=6]. The mapping cone determines the surjectivity of [formula]. Thus [formula] is also surjective and we have

[formula]

where R denotes the kernel.

From the snake lemma applied to [\eqref=8] and [\eqref=3] twisted by d - c, we obtain

[formula]

Again apply the snake lemma to [\eqref=1] and [\eqref=9] to get

[formula]

which splits since [formula]. Thus we proved

[formula]

Observe, that twisting [\eqref=10] by c - d gives [\eqref=eq:res4]. It can be easily verified that the obtained resolution is minimal.

In [\cite=bis] some minimal resolution of ACM rank 2 bundles on cubic and quartic threefolds are determined. If we apply Theorem [\ref=izjave] on these cases we obtain the same resolutions except in the case of [\cite=bis], where X is a quartic threefold and the curve C corresponding to the bundle E with c1 = 2, c2 = 8 is of type (2,2,2). We have a minimal resolution

[formula]

and by Theorem [\ref=izjave] (c = 6, di = 4, c1 = c - di, rj = 2, for j = 1,...,3) we get

[formula]

However, in [\cite=bis] the obtained resolution of E is of the form

[formula]

where k∈{0,2,4}. It is then deduced that k = 0 implies E is 0-regular, so k  ≠  0. We believe this is incorrect, since E in this case is 1-regular. Theorem [\ref=izjave] immediately implies that the case k = 0 is the correct choice.

Classification and existence of ACM curves on CICY threefolds

By [\cite=mad2] a normalized rank 2 ACM bundle on a CICY threefold splits unless - 5 <  - c1(E) < 3. Recall from the Serre correspondence that if E is an indecomposable ACM rank 2 bundle, then the corresponding curve is ACM of degree c2(E) and genus c1(E)c2(E) / 2 + 1. In this section we will classify the indecomposable rank 2 ACM bundles on CICY threefolds.

Quintic threefold

In this subsection we write O for [formula]. For a quintic threefold X in [formula] the minimal resolution of a curve can be determined from the minimal resolution of the corresponding bundle:

Let E be a normalized indecomposable rank 2 vector bundle on X with a minimal resolution

[formula]

Then the corresponding curve has a minimal resolution

[formula]

The proof is similar to the proof of [\cite=chifae] so we omit it (note that c1(E) = c - 5, where c is the integer from Theorem [\ref=theorem1]). The classification of indecomposable ACM rank 2 bundles on a quintic can be found in [\cite=chi]. In particular, the lower bound for c2 is also given: 11  ≤  c2  ≤  14. Theorem [\ref=izjave2] allows us to determine geometric properties of the curves that correspond to these bundles. Many of these properties are already established in [\cite=chi] and [\cite=rao]. Here we only desribe the new ones.

Let E be a bundle with c1 = 2, c2 = 11. From GRR we have h0(E) = 4, h0(E(1)) = 18, h0(E(2)) = 52 and because a minimal resolution of E is of type [\eqref=quintica], we have a minimal resolution

[formula]

From Theorem [\ref=izjave2] the minimal resolution of the coresponding curve C is

[formula]

where the degree matrix (see [\cite=her]) of C is

[formula]

By [\cite=her] C is singular.

In the case of c1 even, the minimal resolution of E can be uniquely determined as above. When c1 is odd, the rank of the direct summands in a minimal resolution of E cannot be determined, similar to the problem in Remark [\ref=indija]. For example, without taking into account the geometry of the corresponding curve, an ACM bundle E with c1 =  - 1 and c2 = 2 has a minimal resolution

[formula]

Since the corresponding curve is a conic, Theorem [\ref=izjave] implies that j = 1.

In the sequel we collect minimal resolutions of all possible indecomposable normalized ACM bundles E of rank 2. By the above methods all these resolutions are uniquely determined, except for c1 = 3. We have:

c1 =  - 2, c2 = 1

[formula]

[formula]

c1 =  - 1, c2 = 2

[formula]

[formula]

c1 = 0, c2 = 3

[formula]

[formula]

c1 = 0, c2 = 4

[formula]

[formula]

c1 = 0, c2 = 5

[formula]

[formula]

c1 = 1, c2 = 4

[formula]

[formula]

c1 = 1, c2 = 6

[formula]

[formula]

c1 = 1, c2 = 8

[formula]

[formula]

c1 = 2, c2 = 11

[formula]

[formula]

c1 = 2, c2 = 12

[formula]

[formula]

c1 = 2, c2 = 13

[formula]

[formula]

c1 = 2, c2 = 14

[formula]

[formula]

c1 = 3, c2 = 20

[formula]

[formula]

where k is odd.

c1 = 4, c2 = 30

[formula]

[formula]

CICY of type (2,4)

Let X8 be a general CICY threefold of type (2,4). The only attempt of classification of indecomposable rank 2 bundles known to the autor can be found in [\cite=mad1].

c1 =  - 2

Bundle E has a section whose 0-locus C is a curve. From the exact sequence

[formula]

we obtain h3(E) = h0(E(2)) = 20, so χ(E) =  - 19. From GRR we have χ(E) =  - 20 + c2, so c2 = 1 and the corresponding curve is a line.

Since a line exists on X8 (see e.g. [\cite=knu]), then by Serre correspondence a bundle with c1 =  - 2 and c2 = 1 exists on X8. We easily see that the minimal resolution of E is not of type [\eqref=eq:pomembno] on either of the two fourfolds containing X8.

c1 =  - 1

As above we have an exact sequence

[formula]

and thus h3(E) = h0(E(1)) = 6. From GRR we have [formula], so c2 = 2. From the above sequence we compute h0(I(1)) = 23 - 20 = 3, so C is a plane conic.

This C has a minimal resolution

[formula]

where Y is a fourfold of degree 2 in [formula]. Theorem [\ref=izjave] gives a minimal resolution of E:

[formula]

c1 = 0

We start with an exact sequence

[formula]

From GRR we obtain h0(E(1)) = 12 - c2, thus we have c2 = 6 - h0(IC(1)), which gives four possibilities for c2: 3, 4, 5, 6. The only case when C is AG in one of the two fourfolds containing X8 is c2 = 4. In this case C is a space curve of type (2,2).

A minimal resolution of a curve C is

[formula]

where Y is a fourfold of degree 2 in [formula]. From Theorem [\ref=izjave] we get

[formula]

c1 = 1

We have

[formula]

Because h3(E) = h0(E( - 1)) = 0, then 1 + h0(IC(1)) = h0(E) = χ(E). From GRR follows c2 = 10 - 2h0(IC(1)). So we have four choices for c2, which are 4,6,8,10.

If c2 = 4 the corresponding curve is a plane quartic with a resolution

[formula]

where Y is a fourfold of degree 4 in [formula]. Theorem [\ref=izjave] yields

[formula]

If c2 = 6 the corresponding curve is a complete intersection of type (2,3) and has a resolution

[formula]

where Y is a fourfold of degree 2 in [formula] and by Theorem [\ref=izjave]

[formula]

If c2 = 8 the corresponding curve is a complete intersection of type (2,2,2) and has a resolution

[formula]

and as before

[formula]

where Y is a fourfold of degree 2 in [formula].

If c2 = 10 the corresponding curve is canonical of genus 6. We will show the existence of this bundle in the next section, which will also give us an indecomposable bundle of higher rank.

c1 = 2

As before we have

[formula]

Beacause h3(E) = h0(E( - 2)) = 0, then 1 + h0(IC(2)) = h0(E) = χ(E). With GRR we see c2 = 19 - h0(IC(2)). So we have c2  ≤  19.

If c2 = 16, then the corresponding ACM curve is a complete intersection of type (2,2,2,2). A minimal resolution of IC is

[formula]

where Y is a fourfold of degree 2 in [formula] and Theorem [\ref=izjave] gives

[formula]

c1 = 3

As above we have

[formula]

and thus h3(E( - 1)) = h0(E( - 2)) = 0. GRR implies c2 = 28.

c1 = 4 As above we have h3(E( - 1)) = 0 and therefore c2 = 44.

Using similar methods as in the case of CICY of type (2,4), we will obtain the remaining cases CICY threefolds of types (3,3), (2,2,3) and (2,2,2,2).

CICY of type (3,3)

Let X9 be a general CICY of type (3,3) and Y a fourfold of degree 3 in [formula].

c1 =  - 2

We have c2 = 1 and the corresponding curve is a line. The existence of a line on X9 was showed in [\cite=knu].

c1 =  - 1

We have c2 = 2 and the corresponding curve is a conic. The existence of a conic on X9 can also be found in [\cite=knu].

c1 = 0

We have 6 + h0(IC(1)) = 12 - c2. This gives four possible choices for c2, which are 3,4,5,6. The only case when C is AG in Y is c2 = 3. In this case the corresponding curve is a plane cubic. We have

[formula]

and

[formula]

c1 = 1

We have [formula] thus by GRR c2 = 10 - 2h0(I(1)). We get four options for c2: 4,6,8,10. The only case when C is AG in Y is c2 = 6. In this case the corresponding curve is a complete intersection of type (2,3). Suitable resolutions are

[formula]

[formula]

c1 = 2

Because h3(E) = h0(E( - 2)) = 0, we have 1 + h0(IC(2)) = h0(E) = χ(E). From GRR we get c2 = 20 - h0(IC(2)) and therefore c2  ≤  20.

c1 = 3 We have h3(E( - 1)) = h0(E( - 2)) = 0 and by GRR we obtain c2 = 30.

c1 = 4 We have h3(E( - 1)) = 0 and by GRR we obtain c2 = 48.

CICY of type (2,2,3) and (2,2,2,2)

Using the above methods concludes the classification of indecomposable rank 2 bundles listed in Theorem [\ref=theorem1]. For c1 =  - 2 and c1 =  - 1, Knutsen [\cite=knu] proved the existence of a line and a conic on X12 and X16. Resolutions of type [\eqref=eq:pomembno] can be writen for bundles with c1 = 0, c2 = 4 and c1 = 1, c2 = 8 on X12 and for c1 = 2, c2 = 16 on X16.

In the next section we will also need the following interesting example, when X is CICY of type (2,2,3) and E is a bundle with c1 = 0 and c2 = 4. In this case we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

where Y is a complete intersection of type (2,2) in [formula].

A smooth elliptic curve C of degree 5 exists on X12 by [\cite=knu]. C corresponds to an indecomposable rank 2 ACM bundle E with c1 = 0, c2 = 5 (C is a locally complete intersection since it is smooth and it is subcanonical since it has trivial canonical sheaf). C is non-degenerate in [formula] and has five quadrics for minimal generators (see [\eqref=g1d5]). Its minimal resolution in a fourfold Y of type (2,2) in [formula] is

[formula]

We can easily see that E is not of type [\eqref=eq:pomembno], despite C being AG in a fourfold of type (2,2) in [formula]. Thus the assumption c1(E) = c - di in Theorem [\ref=izjave] is neccesary (in this case c1(E) = 0, c = 4, di = 3).

A Similar result holds for a bundle corresponding to a smooth elliptic curve C of degree 6 on X16 (by [\cite=fis] C has nine quadrics for minimal generators).

Proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem1]

In the previous section we proved the part of the Theorem [\ref=theorem1] regarding classification. We found the bundles with c1 =  - 2 and c1 =  - 1. Bundles with c1 = 0 correspond to elliptic curves. Knutsen [\cite=knu] showed the existence of smooth elliptic curves on all Xr of degree d  ≥  3, except for d = 3 on X16. By Eisenbud [\cite=eis] smooth elliptic curves are ACM. Since they are smooth and subcanonical, the Serre correspondence gives the existence of ACM bundles with c1 = 0 for all c2 listed in Theorem [\ref=theorem1].

Bundles with c1 = 1 correspond to canonical curves. Knutsen showed the existence of smooth curves of degree 10 and genus 6 on X8 and X9 and smooth curves of degree 12 and genus 7 on X12. These curves are canonical and thus by the Noether-Enriques-Petri theorem they are ACM. Furthermore, following Noether [\cite=noe], Schreyer [\cite=sch] wrote the minimal resolutions of these curves in [formula]

[formula]

where g is the genus of C. It follows that the canonical curves are AG, thus they are subcanonical. The Serre corespondence then implies the existence of ACM bundles with c1 = 1, c2 = 12 on X12 and c1 = 1, c2 = 10 on X8 and X9.

In the sequel we will prove the existence of the remaining bundles from Theorem [\ref=theorem1].

In order to obtain the last three cases of bundles with c1 = 1 we restrict the exact sequence [\eqref=eq:pomembno] to X to obtain

[formula]

First we prove the existence of a bundle with c1 = 1 and c2 = 6 on X8. Recall the minimal resolution [\eqref=X8] of a bundle with c1 =  - 1 and c2 = 2 on X8. As in [\eqref=koneckonec] we get an exact sequence

[formula]

and from this we get a short exact sequence

[formula]

where F is a rank 2 bundle on X8 by the Auslander-Buchsbaum formula. From [\eqref=zadnje] also follows that F is indecomposable and normalized with c1(F) = 1 and c2(F) = 6. The bundle F exists on X8 since E exists.

Next we prove the existence of a bundle with c1 = 1 and c2 = 6 on X9. Consider the minimal resolution [\eqref=X9] of a bundle with c1 = 0 and c2 = 3 on X9. As above we get a short exact sequence

[formula]

where F is a normalized indecomposable rank 2 bundle with c1 = 1 and c2 = 6 on X9.

Finally the existence of a bundle with c1 = 1 and c2 = 8 on X12 will be obtained from the minimal resolution [\eqref=X12] of a bundle with c1 = 0 and c2 = 4 on X12. Again, we get a short exact sequence

[formula]

with F a normalized indecomposable rank 2 bundle with c1 = 1 and c2 = 8 on X12. This finishes the proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem1].

We conclude the paper by proving the existence of an indecomposable bundle of higher rank.

Canonical curves which correspond to bundles with c1 = 1, c2 = 10 on X8 have six minimal quadric generators (see e.g. [\cite=bab]) and thus the minimal resolution of the ideal sheaf IC is

[formula]

where Y is fourfold of degree 4 in [formula]. Theorem [\ref=izjave] gives a minimal resolution of a bundle E with c1 = 1 and c2 = 10:

[formula]

As above, we construct a short exact sequence

[formula]

It can be easily seen that F is either an indecomposable rank 4 vector bundle on X8 or a direct sum of a line bundle and an indecomposable rank 3 bundle.
