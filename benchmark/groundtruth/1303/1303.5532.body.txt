N6 property for third Veronese embeddings

Introduction

Let k be a field of characteristic 0. Let V be a finite dimensional vector space over k of dimension n + 1. The projective space [formula] has coordinate ring naturally isomorphic to [formula]. For each natural number d, the d-th Veronese embedding of [formula], which is naturally embedded into the projective space [formula] has coordinate ring [formula]. For each set of integers p,q,b, let Kdp,q(V,b) be the associated Koszul cohomology group defined as the homology of the 3 term complex

[formula]

Then Kdp,q(V,b) is the space of minimal p-th syzygies of degree p + q of the [formula] module [formula] We write [formula] for the functor on finite dimensional k-vector spaces that assigns to a vector space V the corresponding syzygy module Kdp,q(V,b).

[formula]

The conjecture is known for d  =  2 by the work of Josefiak-Pragacz-Weyman [\cite=JPW] and also known for dim V  =  2 and dim V  =  3 by the work of Green [\cite=G] and Birkenhake [\cite=B]. All other cases are open. Also, Ottaviani and Paoletti in [\cite=OP] showed that Kdp,2(V,0)  ≠  0 for p  =  3d  -  2, when dim V  ≥  3, d  ≥  3. In other words, the conjecture is sharp. Recently, Bruns, Conca, and Römer in [\cite=BCR] showed that Kdd + 1,q(V,0)  =  0 for q  ≥  2. In this paper we will prove the conjecture in the case d  =  3. Thus the main theorem of the paper is:

Theorem [\ref=main]. The third Veronese embeddings of projective spaces satisfy property N6.

To prove Theorem [\ref=main] we prove that vanishing results hold for certain rational homology groups of matching complexes (defined below), and then use [\cite=KRW] to translate between the zyzygy modules Kdp,q(V,b) and the homology groups of matching complexes.

The symmetric group SA acts on CdA by permuting the elements of A making the homology groups of CdA representations of SA. For each partition λ, we denote by Vł the irreducible representation of S|λ| corresponding to the partition λ, and Sł the Schur functor corresponding to the partition λ. For each vector space V, Sł(V) is an irreducible representation of [formula]. The relation between the syzygies of the Veronese embeddings and the homologies of matching complexes is given by the following theorem of Karaguezian, Reiner and Wachs.

[\cite=KRW] Let p,q be non-negative integers, let d be a positive integer and let b be a non-negative integer. Write N  =  (p + q)d  +  b. Consider a partition λ of N. Then the multiplicity of Sł in Kdp,q(b) coincides with the multiplicity of the irreducible SN representation Vł in H̃p - 1(CdN).

This correspondence makes Conjecture 1 equivalent to the following conjecture.

The only non-zero homology groups of Cdnd for n  =  1,...,3d  -  1 is H̃n - 2.

We will prove this conjecture for d  =  3 by computing the homology groups of C3n by induction. To compute the homology groups of the matching complexes inductively, the following equivariant long-exact sequence introduced by Raicu in [\cite=R] is useful. Let A be a finite set with |A|  ≥  2d. Let a∈A be an element of A. Let α be a d-element subset of A such that a∈α. Let [formula], and let [formula], [formula]. Then we have the following long-exact sequence of representations of SB.

[formula]

Morever, for each b, 0  ≤  b  ≤  d - 1, the [formula] module [formula] is a Cohen-Macaulay module in the coordinate ring of the projective space [formula]. The dual of the resolution of each of these modules is the resolution of another such module giving us the duality among the Koszul homology groups Kdp,q(V,b). For simplicity, since we deal with third Veronese embeddings, we will from now on assume that d  =  3. To compute the homology groups of the matching complexes C3n for n  ≤  10 we use the duality in the case dim V  =  2, and to compute the homology groups of the matching complexes C3n for n  ≥  14, we use the duality in the case dim V  =  3, so we will make them explicit here. In the case dim V = 2, the canonical module of [formula] as representation of [formula] is Sł(V) with λ  =  (5,5). From [\cite=W],

[formula]

and the correspondence in Theorem [\ref=trans], we have

The multiplicity of Vł with λ  =  (λ1,λ2) in the homology group H̃p - 1(C3N) coincides with the multiplicity of Vμ with μ  =  (5 - λ2,5 - λ1) in the homology group H̃1 - p(C310 - N).

Similarly, in the case dim V  =  3, the canonical module of [formula] as representation of [formula] is Sł(V) with λ  =  (9,9,9). From [\cite=W],

[formula]

and the correspondence in Theorem [\ref=trans], we have

The multiplicity of Vł with λ  =  (λ1,λ2,λ3) in the homology group H̃p - 1(C3N) coincides with the multiplicity of Vμ with μ  =  (9 - λ3,9 - λ2,9 - λ1) in the homology group H̃6 - p(C327 - N).

Finally, to determine the homology groups of the matching complex C3N, we apply the equivariant long exact sequence ([\ref=equiv]) to derive equalities and inequalities for the multiplicities of the possible irreducible representations in the unknown homology groups of C3N. This is carried out with the help of our Macaulay2 package MatchingComplex.m2 that we will explain in the appendix. We then use Maple to solve this system of equalities and inequalities.

The paper is organized as follows. In the second section, using the equivariant long exact sequence ([\ref=equiv]) and the duality in Proposition [\ref=duality2] we compute homology groups of matching complexes C3n for n  ≤  13. In the third section, using the results in the second section and the duality in Proposition [\ref=duality3] we derive all irreducible representations whose corresponding partitions have at most 3 rows in the homology groups of C3n for n  ≥  14. The systems of equalities and inequalities from exact sequences obtained by applying the equivariant long exact sequence ([\ref=equiv]) with |A|  =  20 and |A|  =  23 will not determine H̃4(C320) and H̃5(C323) uniquely. Thus we need to compute the dimensions of Kp,1(V,2) with p  =  5,6 and dim V  =  4. This is done by using Macaulay2 to compute the dimensions of the spaces of minimal p-th syzygies of degree p + 1 for p  =  6,7 of the module [formula] with dim V  =  4. We then state the results for the homology groups of C3n with 14  ≤  n  ≤  24 and finish the proof of our main theorem. The proof of Proposition [\ref=C23] illustrates the computation of the homology groups of the matching complexes C3n dealing with the most complicated matching complex C323 in the series. In the appendix we explain the ideas behind our package leading to the computation of the homology groups of the matching complexes.

Homology of matching complexes

In this section, using the equivariant long exact sequence ([\ref=equiv]) we compute the homology groups of the matching complexes C3n for n  ≤  13. In the following, we denote the partition λ with row lengths λ1  ≥  λ2  ≥  ...  ≥  λk  ≥  0 by the sequence (λ1,λ2,...,λk) and we use the same notation for the representation Vł. To simplify notation, we omit the subscript and superscript when we use the operators [formula] and [formula]. It is clear from the context and the equivariant long exact sequence what the induction and restriction are. From the definition of the matching complexes, it is not hard to see the following.

The only non-vanishing homology groups of C3n with n  =  4,5,6 are respectively

[formula]

Together with Proposition [\ref=duality2] we have

The only irreducible representations whose corresponding partitions have at most 2 rows in the homology groups of the matching complexes C3n, 7  ≤  n  ≤  10 are

[formula]

where (H̃iC3n)2 denote the subrepresentation of H̃iC3n consisting of all irreducible representations of H̃iC3n whose corresponding partitions have at most 2 rows.

The only non-vanishing homology group of C37 is

[formula]

Applying the equivariant long exact sequence ([\ref=equiv]) with |A|  =  7 we have exact sequences

[formula]

for i  ≠  0,1, and an exact sequence

[formula]

Therefore, H̃iC37  =  0 for i  ≠  0,1. To show that H̃0C37 is zero, note that H̃0C36 maps surjectively onto [formula]. Since H̃0C36  =  (4,2) and by Proposition [\ref=2row], H̃0C37 does not contain any irreducible representations whose corresponding partitions have at most 2 rows, it must be zero. Therefore, we know that [formula] as representation of S6 is equal to

[formula]

Moreover, by Proposition [\ref=2row], H̃1C37 does not contain any irreducible representations whose corresponding partitions have at most 2 rows, thus H̃1C37 must consist (5,1,1) and (3,3,1) as its restriction contains (5,1) and (3,3). But the restriction of [formula] is equal to [formula] so we have the desired conclusion.

The only non-vanishing homology group of C38 is

[formula]

Applying the equivariant long exact sequence ([\ref=equiv]) with |A|  =  8 we have exact sequences

[formula]

for i  ≠  1, and an exact sequence

[formula]

Therefore, H̃iC38  =  0 for i  ≠  1. To compute H̃1C38, note that from the exact sequence

[formula]

which consists of irreducible representations whose corresponding partitions have at most 3 rows, therefore H̃1C38 contains only irreducible representations whose corresponding partitions have at most 3 rows. Moreover, by Proposition [\ref=2row], the only irreducible representation whose corresponding partition has at most 2 rows in H̃1C38 is (5,3). Therefore, the restrictions of irreducible representations whose corresponding partitions have 3 rows in H̃1C38 is equal to

[formula]

It is easy to see that the set of irreducible representations whose corresponding partitions have 3 rows in H̃1C38 has to be equal to [formula].

The only non-vanishing homology group of C39 is

[formula]

Applying the equivariant long exact sequence ([\ref=equiv]) with |A|  =  9 we have exact sequences

[formula]

for i  ≠  1, and an exact sequence

[formula]

Therefore, H̃iC39  =  0 for i  ≠  1, and

[formula]

Moreover, by Proposition [\ref=2row], the only irreducible representation whose corresponding partition has at most 2 rows in H̃1C39 is (5,4). Therefore, the restrictions of irreducible representations whose corresponding partitions have 3 rows in H̃1C39 is equal to

[formula]

It is easy to see that the set of irreducible representations whose corresponding partitions have 3 rows in H̃1C39 has to be equal to [formula].

The only non-vanishing homology groups of C310 are

[formula]

Applying the equivariant long exact sequence ([\ref=equiv]) with |A|  =  10 we have exact sequences

[formula]

for i  ≠  1,2, and an exact sequence

[formula]

Therefore, H̃iC310  =  0 for i  ≠  1,2. Since H̃1C39 maps surjectively onto [formula], and by Proposition [\ref=2row], H̃1C310 contains the irreducible representation (5,5), [formula] maps surjectively onto the restrictions of the other irreducible representations of H̃1C310. Moreover, there is no irreducible representation of S10 whose restriction is a subrepresentation of [formula], thus H̃1C310  =  (5,5). Therefore, [formula] is equal to

[formula]

Moreover, since H̃1C310  =  (5,5), by Theorem [\ref=trans], K2,1(V,1)  =  Sł(V) with λ  =  (5,5). Since [formula] with dim V  =  3 is a Cohen-Macaulay module of codimension 7 with h-vector (3,6),

[formula]

By Theorem [\ref=trans], H̃2C310 does not contain any irreducible representations whose corresponding partitions have at most 3 rows, therefore it must contain irreducible representations (3,3,3,1), (5,3,1,1), (7,1,1,1) each with multiplicity 1. But the sum of the restrictions of these irreducible representations is equal to the restriction of H̃2C310 already, thus we have the desired conclusion.

The only non-vanishing homology group of C311 is

[formula]

Applying the equivariant long exact sequence ([\ref=equiv]) with |A|  =  11 we have exact sequences

[formula]

for i  ≠  1,2 and an exact sequence

[formula]

Therefore, H̃iC311  =  0 for i  ≠  1,2. To show that H̃1C311 is zero, note that H̃1C310, consists of partition (5,5) only, maps surjectively onto [formula], so H̃1C311  =  0. Thus

[formula]

Moreover, H̃2C311 does not contain any irreducible representations whose corresponding partitions have at most 2 rows, but [formula] contains (6,4) and (7,3), thus H̃2C311 must contain (6,4,1) and (7,3,1) each with multiplicity 1. The restrictions of the remaining irreducible representations is equal to

[formula]

To find a set of irreducible representations whose sum of the restrictions is A, we first induce A. We then eliminate all irreducible representations whose restrictions are not contained in A. After that, we have a set of partitions B. Then we write down the set of equations that make the restriction of B equal to A. Then we solve for the non-negative integer solutions of that system. For this problem, it is easy to see that we have a unique solution as in the statement of the proposition.

The only non-vanishing homology group of C312 is

[formula]

Applying the equivariant long exact sequence ([\ref=equiv]) with |A|  =  12 we have exact sequences

[formula]

for i  ≠  2 and an exact sequence

[formula]

Therefore, H̃iC312  =  0 for i  ≠  2 and

[formula]

Moreover, H̃2C312 does not contain any irreducible representations whose corresponding partitions have at most 2 rows, but [formula] contains (6,5) and (7,4), thus H̃2C312 must contain (6,5,1) and (7,4,1) each with multiplicity 1. Therefore, the sum of the restrictions of other irreducible representations in H̃2C312 is equal to

[formula]

Let B be the set containing all irreducible representations that appears in the induction of A whose restrictions are contained in A. Write down the equations that make the restriction of B equal to A. Then we solve for the non-negative integer solutions of that system. For this problem, it is easy to see that we have a unique solution as in the statement of the proposition.

The only non-vanishing homology groups of C313 are

[formula]

Applying the equivariant long exact sequence ([\ref=equiv]) with |A|  =  13 we have exact sequences

[formula]

for i  ≠  2,3 and an exact sequence

[formula]

Therefore, H̃iC313  =  0 for i  ≠  2,3. From the sequence, [formula] is contained in [formula] and contains [formula]. There is a unique solution as indicated in the proposition. Therefore,

[formula]

Moreover, [formula] does not contain any irreducible representations whose corresponding partitions have at most two rows, but its restriction contains (7,5), thus it must contain (7,5,1) with multiplicity 1. Therefore, the sum of the restrictions of the other irreducible representations in H̃2C313 is equal to

[formula]

It is easy to see that there is a unique solution as stated in the proposition.

Proof of the main theorem

In this section we determine the homology groups of the matching complexes C3n for 14  ≤  n  ≤  24 using the equivariant long exact sequence ([\ref=equiv]) and the duality as stated in Proposition [\ref=duality3]. Note that to determine the homology groups of C320 and C323 we need to compute the dimensions of Kp,0(V,2) for p  =  6,7. In the following, for a representation W of the symmetric group SN and a positive number k, we denote by Wk the direct sum of all irreducible representations of W whose corresponding partitions have at most r rows and let Wk  =  W  -  Wk.

The only homology groups of C3n for 14  ≤  n  ≤  24 containing irreducible representations whose corresponding partitions have at most 3 rows are H̃3C314, H̃3C315, H̃3C316, H̃4C317, H̃4C318, H̃4C319, H̃4C320, H̃5C321, H̃5C322 and H̃5C323. Moreover,

[formula]

This follows from the results of the homology of matching complexes C3n for n  ≤  13 in section [\ref=Sec1] and the duality in Proposition [\ref=duality3].

The only non-vanishing homology groups of C3n for 14  ≤  n  ≤  19 are H̃3C314, H̃3C315, H̃3C316, H̃4C316, H̃4C317, H̃4C318, H̃4C319, H̃5C319.

The computational proof is given in our Macaulay2 package MatchingComplex.m2.

The only non-vanishing homology groups of C320 are H̃5C320 and

[formula]

Applying the equivariant long exact sequence ([\ref=equiv]) with |A|  =  20 we have exact sequences

[formula]

for i  ≠  4,5 and an exact sequence

[formula]

Therefore, H̃iC320  =  0 for i  ≠  4,5. By Theorem [\ref=trans], K4,2(2)  =  0. To determine H̃4C320, note that by Proposition [\ref=Prop2.1] and Theorem [\ref=trans], K5,1(V,2) contains [formula] where λ  =  (8,8,4) and μ  =  (8,6,6). Moreover, using Macaulay2 to compute the dimensions of minimal linear syzygies of the module [formula] with dim V  =  4, we get dim K6,0(V,2)  =  14003. Since [formula] is a Cohen-Macaulay module of codimension 16 with h-vector (10,16,1),

[formula]

Since dim M  =  1991, [formula]. By Theorem [\ref=trans],

[formula]

Finally,

[formula]

This determines H̃5C320 as given in our package MatchingComplex.m2.

The only non-vanishing homology groups of C321 and C322 are H̃5C321, H̃5C322, H̃6C322.

The computational proof is given in our Macaulay2 package MatchingComplex.m2.

The only non-vanishing homology groups of C323 are H̃6C323 and

[formula]

Applying the equivariant long exact sequence ([\ref=equiv]) with |A|  =  23 we have exact sequences

[formula]

for i  ≠  5,6, and an exact sequence

[formula]

Therefore, H̃iC323  =  0 for i  ≠  5,6. Moreover, by Proposition [\ref=C20], [formula]. Therefore, we have an exact sequence

[formula]

By Proposition [\ref=Prop2.1], we know that

[formula]

Let Y be the direct sum of irreducible representations whose corresponding partitions have 4 rows in H̃5C323. Then from exact sequence ([\ref=Eq2]), we have

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

is a subrepresentation of Y. By Proposition [\ref=C20], [formula], thus [formula] maps surjectively onto [formula]. Let

[formula]

Then the exact sequence ([\ref=Eq1]) becomes

[formula]

where Z  =  H̃5C323  -  Y1  -  (9,8,6).

By Proposition [\ref=computation2], H̃6C322 contains only irreducible representations whose corresponding partitions have 8 rows while H̃5C322 contains only irreducible representations whose corresponding partitions have at most 6 rows. Thus we have

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] This exact sequence determines the irreducible representations of H̃6C323 whose corresponding partitions have 7 or 8 rows as given in our package MatchingComplex.m2. Let

[formula]

where (H̃6C323)6 is the direct sum of irreducible representations in H̃6C323 whose corresponding partitions have 7 and 8 rows described above. Then the exact sequence ([\ref=Eq3]) becomes

[formula]

Finally, using Macaulay2 to compute the dimensions of minimal linear syzygies of the module [formula] with dim V  =  4, we get dim K7,0(V,2)  =  5400. Moreover, H̃4C323  =  0, thus by Theorem [\ref=trans], K5,2(V,2)  =  0. Since [formula] is a Cohen-Macaulay module of codimension 16 with h-vector (10,16,1),

[formula]

Since the sum of dimensions of irreducible representations Sł(V) corresponding to partitions λ in [formula] is equal to 11520, the sum of dimensions of irreducible representations Sł(V) corresponding to partitions λ in Z is 14760  -  11520  =  3240. This fact and exact sequence ([\ref=Eq4]) determine H̃5C323 as stated in the proposition and H̃6C323 as given in our package MatchingComplex.m2.

The third Veronese embeddings of projective spaces satisfy property N6.

It remains to prove that the only non-zero homology groups of the matching complex C324 is H̃6C324. Applying the equivariant long exact sequence ([\ref=equiv]) with |A|  =  24 we have exact sequences

[formula]

for i  ≠  5,6, and an exact sequence

[formula]

Therefore, H̃iC324  =  0 for i  ≠  5,6 and H̃5C323 maps surjectively onto [formula]. Moreover, by the result of Ottaviani-Paoletti [\cite=OP], the third Veronese embedding of [formula] satisfies property N6. By Theorem [\ref=trans], H̃5C324 does not contain any irreducible representations whose corresponding partitions have at most 4 rows. By Proposition [\ref=C23], H̃5C323 contains only irreducible representations whose corresponding partitions have at most 4 rows, thus H̃5C324 is zero.

Appendix

In this appendix we explain the ideas behind our Macaulay2 package MatchingComplex.m2. To determine the homology groups of C3N inductively we use the equivariant long exact sequence ([\ref=equiv]) with |A|  =  N to determine two representations B and C of SN - 1 satisfying the following property. B is a subrepresentation of [formula] and C is a superrepresentation of [formula]. To determine H̃iC3N, we need to find a representation X of SN satifying the property that [formula] is a subrepresentation of C and a superrepresentation of B. The function findEquation in our package will first determine a list D of all possible partition λ of N such that [formula] is a subrepresentation of C. Let [formula] where xł  ≥  0 is the multiplicity of the partition λ∈D that we need to determine. Restricting X we have inequalities (obtained by calling findEquation B and findEquation C) expressing the fact that [formula] is a subrepresentation of C and a superrepresentation of B. We then use maple to solve for non-negative integer solutions of this system of inequalities.
