Introduction

The main goal of present article is to justify the application of the classical direct scattering Born approximation for the magnetic Schrödinger operator. The direct Born approximation is known as the most applicable approximate method in the numerous practical problems. It is also known that the inverse scattering Born approximation is well-defined and perfectly works (as the mathematical tool) in the case of linear and nonlinear Schrödinger operators and for all types of scattering data: full scattering, backscattering, fixed angle scattering and fixed energy scattering. For some scattering data it is possible to get the uniqueness and reconstruction procedure while for some data we are able to reconstruct singularities and jumps of unknowns even when there is no uniqueness. We mention here the results of Päivärinta and Somersalo [\cite=PSo], Nachman [\cite=N1], [\cite=N2], Sun and Uhlmann [\cite=SuU], Isakov and Sylvester [\cite=ISy], Päivärinta, Serov and Somersalo [\cite=PSeSo], Päivärinta and Serov [\cite=PSe1], [\cite=PSe3], [\cite=PSe4], Ola, Päivärinta and Serov [\cite=OPSe], Ruiz [\cite=Ru], Ruiz and Vargas [\cite=RuV], Päivärinta and Serov [\cite=PSe2], Reyes [\cite=Re], Serov [\cite=Se], Serov and Harju [\cite=SeH1], [\cite=SeH2], Serov and Sandhu [\cite=SeSa], Lechleiter [\cite=Le], Reyes and Ruiz [\cite=ReRu] and some others. The main point of all these results is the precise calculation of the first (quadratic) nonlinear term in the Born series. For the magnetic Schrödinger operator the direct scattering problem (i.e., existence of the scattering solutions) as well as the inverse scattering Born approximation are not familiar at all. The big interest to this problem is connected to the fact that the knowledge of the scattering amplitude with backscattering data allows us to obtain essential information about the unknowns.

We consider the magnetic Schrödinger operator

[formula]

in dimensions n = 2,3, where the coefficients [formula] and V(x) are assumed to be real-valued. We assume generally that [formula] and

[formula]

and

[formula]

where [formula]. Here Lpσ denotes usual weighted Lebesgue space and Sobolev space W1p,σ is understood so that f belongs to W1p,σ(Rn) if and only if f and [formula] belong to Lpσ(Rn). For the case p = 2 instead of the symbol W12,σ we use the symbol H1σ.

It is well-known that under these conditions for the coefficients of the magnetic Schrödinger operator the following Gå rding's inequality holds:

[formula]

where 0 < ν < 1,C > 0. This inequality allows us to define symmetric operator H by the method of quadratic forms. H has a self-adjoint Friedrichs extension with the domain (in general)

[formula]

In our particular case it is possible to prove that actually

[formula]

In the scattering theory the main role are played by the special solutions of the equation

[formula]

which are of the form

[formula]

where u0(x) = eik(x,θ) is incident wave with direction θ∈Sn - 1 and the scattered wave usc(x) satisfies the Sommerfeld radiation condition at the infinity, i.e.

[formula]

In this case the total field u satisfies the so-called Lippmann-Schwinger equation

[formula]

where [formula] and G+k is the kernel of integral operator ( - Δ - k2 - i0)- 1. Using the representation u = u0 + usc we rewrite this integral equation (1.5) only for scattered field usc as

[formula]

where ũ0 is equal to

[formula]

We use the following results of Agmon [\cite=Ag] (see Remark 2, Appendix A):

[formula]

where [formula] and H2-  δ(Rn) denotes the weighted Sobolev space. As a consequence we have (for fixed k) that

[formula]

and uniformly in |k|  ≥  1 we have that

[formula]

But since ( - Δ - k2 - i0)- 1 is the integral operator of convolution type we can conclude that for fixed k it maps continuously H- 1δ(Rn) to H1-  δ(Rn), where H- 1δ(Rn) denotes the dual of the Sobolev space H1-  δ(Rn).

We rewrite (1.6) as the integral equation

[formula]

where the integral operator Lk is defined as

[formula]

The main result of present article is Theorem 2.1 which provides the existence of the scattering solutions for the magnetic Schrödinger operator. This theorem is proved in Section 2. Based on the main result we justify in Section 3 the direct Born approximation for such operators.

Existence of the scattering solutions

We are preceding a proof of the main result by the following lemmas.

Suppose that conditions (1.2) and (1.3) are fulfilled. Then there is [formula] such that ũ0∈H1-  δ0(Rn) and the integral operator Lk maps H1-  δ0(Rn) into itself.

Conditions for p and δ from (1.2) and (1.3) imply that there is [formula] such that

[formula]

It is therefore true that under the conditions (1.2) and (1.3) functions V, [formula], [formula] and [formula] belong to L2δ0(Rn) with the same δ0. Since u0 is a bounded and smooth function we may conclude (using Agmon's result (1.8)) that ũ0 belongs to H1-  δ0(Rn). It can be mentioned here that we have no longer uniform estimates in k as in (1.8). In order to prove that Lk maps H1-  δ0(Rn) into itself we note that if f belongs to H1-  δ0(Rn) then [formula] belongs to usual Sobolev space H1(Rn). Using now Sobolev imbedding theorem we conclude that

[formula]

Then the conditions (1.2) and (1.3) and Hölder inequality allow us easily conclude that f and [formula] belong L2δ0(Rn). Since we have [formula] the function [formula] will belong to L2δ0(Rn) too. The final step is the application of Agmon's result (1.8).

We may prove a little bit more about this operator Lk.

Let us assume that [formula],

[formula]

where [formula], and

[formula]

and that [formula] and V have special behavior at the infinity such that

[formula]

where μ > 2 for n = 2,3. Then the operator Lk is compact in H1-  δ0(Rn) for some [formula].

Let us choose R > 0 large enough and represent [formula] and [formula] as

[formula]

where the supports of the functions V1, [formula] and [formula] are included in the ball BR  =  {x∈Rn:|x|  ≤  R}, but supports of the functions V2, [formula] and [formula] are included in the set {x∈Rn:|x|  ≥  R}. Without loss of generality we assume in addition that the functions V2, [formula] and [formula] are continuous and satisfy the conditions (2.3) for all |x|  ≥  R.

Conditions (2.1)-(2.2) and the previous considerations imply that

[formula]

for any function f∈H1-  δ0(Rn). But L2(BR) is compactly imbedded in H- 1(BR) and therefore in H- 1δ0(Rn) for [formula]. It remains to mention now that due to Agmon's result (1.8) operator ( - Δ - k2 - i0)- 1 maps continuously the space H- 1δ0(Rn) to the space H1-  δ0(Rn). Thus, part of the operator Lk that corresponds to [formula] and [formula] is compact in H1-  δ0(Rn) for [formula]. Since outside the ball BR these functions V2, [formula] and [formula] satisfy the conditions (2.3) we may firstly conclude using Sobolev imbedding theorem that for f∈H1-  δ0(Rn) we have

[formula]

for some δ0 if and only if μ > 2δ0 + 1. But under the conditions of Lemma 2.2 this criterion is satisfied if [formula] is chosen appropriately.

Since the conditions (2.3) are satisfied we can find two sequences [formula] and ψj(x) (vector-valued) [formula] such that

[formula]

[formula]

as j  →    ∞   for any δ' < μ. These approximation properties imply that

[formula]

[formula]

as j  →    ∞  , where Qj = |ψj|2  +  φj. Since we can choose [formula] and μ from condition (2.3) such that 2δ0  <  μ then (2.4) means that part of the operator Lk which corresponds to [formula] and [formula] is compact in H1-  δ0(Rn) too.

Under the same assumptions as in Lemma 2.2 for any fixed k > 0 and for any f∈H1-  δ0(Rn) with some [formula] the following asymptotical representation holds:

[formula]

[formula]

where [formula].

In view of (1.9) one must study the behavior for |x|  →    ∞   of the function

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the Hankel function of first kind and of order [formula]. In order to do that we take two cases, k|x - y| > 1 and k|x - y| < 1. For the first case we use the behavior of the Hankel function [formula] for large argument (see, for example, [\cite=L]), i.e.

[formula]

So that (k > 0 is fixed) we have that,

[formula]

Consider two subcases, |y|  ≤  |x|a and |y|  ≥  |x|a, where [formula] is a parameter. In the first case we have (since [formula])

[formula]

That is why we have for |y|  ≤  |x|a with [formula] that

[formula]

as |x|  →    +    ∞  . Substituting this asymptotic to the integral

[formula]

gives that

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

The conditions (2.1)-(2.3) allow us easily conclude that for any f∈H1-  δ0(Rn) the integrand [formula] belongs to L1(Rn). Hence, the last term in the latter sum is [formula] since [formula]. Denoting the second term in the latter sum (2.6) by I we may estimate it (using conditions (2.3)) as follows:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Since f∈H1-  δ0(Rn) the latter inequality implies

[formula]

Since [formula] then [formula] can be chosen here such that the last integral in (2.7) might be considered as the convolution of "weak singularities" and therefore we have

[formula]

The first case k|x - y| > 1 is thus completely investigated.

In order to consider the second case k|x - y| < 1 we use the behavior of the Hankel function [formula] for small argument (see [\cite=L])

[formula]

Let us consider first n = 3. Then using this asymptotic and taking into account that for fixed k > 0 and large |x| it can be assumed that [formula], one can estimate the integral

[formula]

as

[formula]

[formula]

for |x|  →    +    ∞  , if δ0 is chosen such that [formula]. In the same way we have that

[formula]

in the two dimensional case due to the behavior of the Hankel function H(1)0 for small argument. Combining (2.6), (2.8) and (2.9) we get (2.5).

The proof of the last lemma shows that the function Lkf(x) is continuous for all x such that |x|  ≥  R, where R is large enough.

These lemmas allow us to obtain the main result of this work.

Under the same assumptions as in Lemma 2.2 and for any k  ≠  0 the integral equation (1.6) has a unique scattering solution from the space H1-  δ0(Rn) for some [formula].

Since the operator Lk is compact in the space H1-  δ0(Rn) we can apply the Riesz theory in this Hilbert space. Based on this methodology we will prove that the homogeneous equation f - Lkf = 0 has only the trivial solution in the space H1-  δ0(Rn) (i.e. the operator I - Lk is injective). But this will imply that the operator is also surjective and the inverse (I - Lk)- 1 is bounded in H1-  δ0(Rn). This condition is equivalent to the claim that the equation (1.6) has a unique solution from the space H1-  δ0(Rn).

It is possible to check that any f∈H1-  δ0(Rn) which satisfies the homogeneous equation f - Lkf = 0 belongs to H2loc(Rn) and satisfies also the equation

[formula]

and Sommerfeld radiation condition (1.4). These facts imply that

[formula]

The divergence theorem then gives that

[formula]

where ν denotes the normal vector at the boundary of the ball BR. The radiation conditions (1.4) for the functions f and [formula] allow us to conclude that

[formula]

Now the assumption that the function f∈H1-  δ0(Rn) satisfies the homogeneous equation f - Lkf = 0 implies by the equation (2.5) that

[formula]

This behavior and the condition (2.3) imply that

[formula]

This fact and Lemma 2.3 (see (2.5)) allow us easily conclude that (it is enough to integrate in (2.5) with respect to x)

[formula]

Thus, we have actually (since the function f satisfies the homogeneous equation f - Lkf = 0) that

[formula]

The Sommerfeld radiation condition (1.4) implies also that

[formula]

Using these two facts we are going to prove that f = 0 a.e. In order to do so we first prove that [formula] for |x|  ≥  R0 with R0 large enough. Indeed, it suffices to prove that, for r  ≥  R0, the radial function

[formula]

is identically equal to zero for each eigenfunction φ of the Laplace operator ΔS on the unit sphere Sn - 1. The eigenfunctions satisfy the equations

[formula]

where μ2 are the eigenvalues of the Laplace operator ΔS (see, for example, [\cite=Sh]).

In view of the formula for the Laplacian Δ on Rn in polar coordinates

[formula]

it follows that F(r) satisfies the ordinary differential equation

[formula]

[formula]

where [formula]. Let us rewrite this linear equation in the form

[formula]

Since V and [formula] satisfy (2.3) then it is not difficult to check that function Φ(r) from the right-hand side of equation (2.13) for r  →    ∞   behaves as

[formula]

It is well-known (see, for example, [\cite=L]) that the homogeneous equation corresponding to (2.13) has two linearly independent solutions [formula], j = 1,2, where H(1)ν(z) and H(2)ν(z) are the Hankel functions of order [formula] and of the first and the second kind, respectively. In view of the asymptotic behavior of the Hankel functions (see [\cite=L]) it follows that the behavior of these two solutions is of the form

[formula]

where +   corresponds to j = 1 and -   corresponds to j = 2. Next, we use Green's function (see, for example, [\cite=St]) for the Bessel equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions on the interval

[formula]

u(r)=()(H(kr)H(kr)-H(kr)H(kr)),

[formula]

u(r)=()(H(2kr)H(kr)-H(kr)H(2kr)),

[formula]

F(r)=KrH(kr)+KrH(kr)+g(r,ξ)Φ(ξ,F) dξ,

[formula]

If the conditions (2.1)-(2.3) are satisfied then the magnetic Schrödinger operator H has no positive eigenvalues.

If λ is a positive eigenvalue of H then

[formula]

It means that this u belongs to the domain of the Friedrichs self-adjoint extension of H and therefore u∈W12(Rn). This fact allows us to conclude that this u satisfies the homogeneous equation

[formula]

with an integral operator from (1.9). Thus, since W12(Rn)  ⊂  H1-  δ(Rn) for [formula] (actually this imbedding holds for any δ > 0) we may apply to this u the same proof as in Theorem 2.1 and conclude that actually [formula].

Using Agmon's results (1.8) the operator Lk can be extended to the space L2-  δ(Rn) as a uniformly bounded operator with respect to k  ≥  1 such that

[formula]

where constant C depends only on the corresponding norms of V, [formula] and [formula]. Based on this fact one can show that if the corresponding norms of V, [formula] and [formula] are small enough then the operator norm of Lk as an operator from L2-  δ(Rn) to itself is strictly less than 1. In that case the formula (2.18) can be rewritten as

[formula]

Thus, the scattering solution u can be obtained as the series of iterations of u0 in the equation (1.5).

Scattering amplitude and direct backscattering Born approximation

In this section we will consider the direct backscattering Born approximation for the magnetic Schrödinger operator H with conditions (2.1)-(2.3). The motivation to this problem is connected to the fact that the knowledge of the scattering amplitude with the backscattering data gives essential information about the unknown function V and [formula].

Theorem 2.1 and Lemma 2.3 (see (2.5)) yield the following asymptotical representation for the scattering solutions u(x,k,θ) with fixed k > 0 as |x|  →    +    ∞  :

[formula]

where function A is called the scattering amplitude and defined by

[formula]

Substituting u = u0 + usc into the equation (3.1) gives that

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

The function AB is called the direct Born approximation. It can be checked (using integration by parts) that AB is actually equal to

[formula]

where F denotes usual n - dimensional Fourier transform as

[formula]

The particular case θ' =  - θ yields the direct backscattering Born approximation

[formula]

Formulae (3.2) and (3.3) show that in the frame of the Born approximation

[formula]

But we want to write more terms in the Born series. For this purpose we calculate term R in the scattering amplitude. Using the series (2.20) and integration by parts we have that

[formula]

[formula]

where the term R2 corresponds to the series [formula] and equals to

[formula]

[formula]

It will be shown that the term which correspond to R2 in the definition (3.1) might be neglected because of the smallness of the operator norm Lk in the space L2-  δ(Rn).

Since Lku0(y) is equal to

[formula]

then we obtain (after some simple calculations) the following representation:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

It can be mentioned here that this equality must be understood in the sense of tempered distributions.

Using the facts [formula] and [formula] we can calculate the terms Ij,j = 1,2,3,4, more precisely as

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Our next step is to neglect the term R2 in (3.5) and justify this neglect. Indeed, using (1.7) and Agmon's results (1.8) the L2-  δ-norm of Lku0 can be estimated as (uniformly in |k|  ≥  1)

[formula]

The conditions (2.1)-(2.3) show that the right hand-side of the latter inequality is finite. Thus, there is a constant c0 depending only on the L2δ-norms of functions [formula], [formula] and [formula] such that uniformly in |k|  ≥  1

[formula]

At the same time for any function f∈H1-  δ(Rn) with some [formula] we can easily obtain

[formula]

where p is the same as in the conditions (2.1)-(2.2). We can rewrite (3.8) in the form of operator norm

[formula]

where constant c1 depends only on the norms of functions [formula], [formula] and [formula] from (3.8). Hence, we may assume that these norms are chosen so small that c1 < 1. Now we extend the operator Lk as an operator from L2-  δ(Rn) to L2-  δ(Rn) with the same norm estimate as in (3.9). This fact together with estimate (3.7) imply that

[formula]

Hence, the left hand-side of (3.10) can be made as small as we want if c1 (and, in addition, c0) are chosen small enough. This fact and duality arguments show that

[formula]

The estimates (3.10) and (3.11) imply that one can have the term R2(k, - θ,θ) as small as desired uniformly in |k|  ≥  1 and θ∈Sn - 1 if the corresponding norms of functions [formula], [formula] and [formula] (or the constants c0 and c1) are chosen small enough. Thus, the term R2(k, - θ,θ) can be neglected in the Born approximation.

Summarizing our considerations (see (3.5)-(3.6) and (3.10)-(3.11)) we may now obtain the following direct backscattering Born approximation (more precise than (3.3)) for the magnetic Schrödinger operator

[formula]

This formula gives us very good approximation for the backscattering amplitude A. It is very important that for this approximation we need to have only the magnetic potential [formula] and electric potential V, but we do not need (as we can see the formula (3.1)) to have the scattering solutions u(x,k,θ) of the equation

[formula]

This direct approximation (3.12) will be effectively used for the inverse backscattering Born approximation. Namely, due to formulas (3.6) we will be able to calculate precisely the quadratic term in the Born series that corresponds to the inverse backscattering approximation and to estimate its smoothness. This smoothness result together with (3.12) will give us the solution of the inverse backscattering problem with respect to the reconstruction of the singularities and jumps of the unknowns. These problems will be investigated carefully in the futures publications.
