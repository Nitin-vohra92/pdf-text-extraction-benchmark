The algebraic fundamental group of a reductive group scheme over an arbitrary base scheme

Introduction

If G is a (connected) reductive algebraic group over a field k of characteristic 0 and T is a maximal k-torus of G, the algebraic fundamental group π1(G,T) of the pair (G,T) was defined by the first-named author [\cite=bor] and shown there to be independent (up to a canonical isomorphism) of the choice of T and useful in the study of the first Galois cohomology set of G. See Definition [\ref=g] [\ref=t] below for a generalization of the original definition of π1(G,T). Independently, and at about the same time, Merkurjev [\cite=Merkurjev] defined the algebraic fundamental group of G over an arbitrary field. Later, Colliot-Thélène [\cite=ct] defined the algebraic fundamental group π1(G) of G in terms of a flasque resolution of G, showed that his definition was independent (up to a canonical isomorphism) of the choice of the resolution, and established the existence of a canonical isomorphism π1(G)≃π1(G,T), see [\cite=ct]. Recall that a flasque resolution of G is a central extension

[formula]

where the derived group [formula] of H is simply connected, [formula] is a quasi-trivial k-torus, and F is a flasque k-torus, i.e., the group of cocharacters of F is an H1-trivial Galois module. It turns out that flasque resolutions of reductive group schemes exist over bases that are more general than spectra of fields, and the second-named author has used such resolutions to generalize Colliot-Thélène's definition of π1(G) to reductive group schemes G over any non-empty, reduced, connected, locally Noetherian and geometrically unibranch scheme. See [\cite=GA-flasque].

In the present paper we extend the definition of [\cite=GA-flasque] to reductive group schemes G over an arbitrary non-empty scheme. Since flasque resolutions are not available in this general setting (see [\cite=GA-flasque]), we shall use instead t-resolutions, which exist over any non-empty base scheme S. A t-resolution of G is a central extension

[formula]

where T is an S-torus and H is a reductive S-group scheme such that the derived group [formula] is simply connected. Since a flasque resolution is a particular type of t-resolution, the definition of π1(G) given here (Definition [\ref=def:pi_1]) does indeed extend the definition of the second-named author [\cite=GA-flasque]. Further, since the choice of a maximal S-torus of G (when one exists) canonically determines a t-resolution of G (see Lemma [\ref=c:t-special]), our Definition [\ref=def:pi_1] turns out to be a common generalization of the definitions of [\cite=bor] and of [\cite=ct] and [\cite=GA-flasque].

Once the general definition of π1(G) is in place, we proceed to study some of the basic properties of the resulting functor G  ↦  π1(G), culminating in a proof of its exactness (Theorem [\ref=thm:pi1-exact]). We give, in fact, two proofs of Theorem [\ref=thm:pi1-exact], the second of which makes use of the étale-local existence of maximal tori in reductive S-group schemes and generalizes [\cite=BKG]. In the final section of the paper we use t-resolutions to relate the (flat) abelian cohomology of G over S introduced in [\cite=ga2] to the cohomology of S-tori, thereby generalizing [\cite=GA-flasque].

Let G be a (connected) reductive group over the field of complex numbers [formula]. Here we comment on the interrelation between the algebraic fundamental group π1(G), the topological fundamental group [formula], and the étale fundamental group [formula]. By [\cite=bor] the algebraic fundamental group π1(G) is canonically isomorphic to the group

[formula]

It follows that if G is a reductive k-group G over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic zero, then the profinite completion of π1(G) is canonically isomorphic to the group

[formula]

where Homcont denotes the group of continuous homomorphisms and [formula] denotes the multiplicative group over k. See [\cite=BD] for details and for a generalization of the algebraic fundamental group π1(G) to arbitrary homogeneous spaces of connected linear algebraic groups.

Notation and terminology. Throughout this paper, S denotes a non-empty scheme. An S-torus is an S-group scheme which is fpqc-locally isomorphic to a group of the form [formula] for some integer n  ≥  0 [\cite=sga3]. An S-torus is affine, smooth and of finite presentation over S [\cite=sga3]. An S-group scheme G is called reductive (respectively, semisimple, simply connected) if it is affine and smooth over S and its geometric fibers are connected reductive (respectively, semisimple, simply connected) algebraic groups [\cite=sga3]. An S-torus is reductive, and any reductive S-group scheme is of finite presentation over S [\cite=sga3]. Now, if G is a reductive group scheme over S, [formula] will denote the radical of G, i.e., the identity component of the center Z(G) of G. Further, [formula] will denote the derived group of G. Thus [formula] is a normal semisimple subgroup scheme of G and [formula] is the largest quotient of G which is an S-torus. We shall write [formula] for the simply connected central cover of [formula] and [formula] for the fundamental group of [formula]. See [\cite=GA-flasque] for the existence and basic properties of [formula]. There exists a canonical homomorphism [formula] which factors as [formula]. In particular, [formula] and [formula].

If X is a (commutative) finitely generated twisted constant S-group scheme [\cite=sga3], then X is quasi-isotrivial, i.e., there exists a surjective étale morphism [formula] such that [formula] is constant. Further, the functors

[formula]

are mutually quasi-inverse anti-equivalences between the categories of finitely generated twisted constant S-group schemes and S-group schemes of finite type and of multiplicative type [\cite=sga3]. Further, M  →  M* and X  →  X* are exact functors (see [\cite=sga3] and use faithfully flat descent). If G is a reductive S-group scheme, its group of characters [formula] equals [formula] (see [\cite=sga3]). Now, if T is an S-torus, the functor [formula] is represented by a (free and finitely generated) twisted constant S-group scheme which is denoted by T* and called the group of cocharacters of   T (see [\cite=sga3]). There exists a canonical isomorphism of free and finitely generated twisted constant S-group schemes

[formula]

A sequence

[formula]

of reductive S-group schemes and S-homomorphisms is called exact if it is exact as a sequence of sheaves for the fppf topology on S. In this case the sequence [\eqref=e:exact] will be called an extension of G by T.

If G is a reductive S-group scheme, the identity homomorphism G  →  G will be denoted idG. Further, if T is an S-torus, the inversion automorphism T  →  T will be denoted [formula].

Definition of π1

Let G be a reductive S-group scheme. A t-resolution of G is a central extension

[formula]

where T is an S-torus and H is a reductive S-group scheme such that [formula] is simply connected.

Every reductive S-group scheme admits a t-resolution.

By [\cite=sga3], the product in G defines a faithfully flat homomorphism [formula] which induces a faithfully flat homomorphism [formula]. Let μ1  =   ker [null], which is a finite S-group scheme of multiplicative type contained in the center of [formula] (see [\cite=GA-flasque]). By [\cite=cnrd], there exist an S-torus T and a closed immersion [formula]. Let H be the pushout of [formula] and [formula], i.e., the cokernel of the central embedding

[formula]

Then H is a reductive S-group scheme, cf. [\cite=sga3], which fits into an exact sequence

[formula]

where T is central in H. Now, as in [\cite=ct] and [\cite=GA-flasque], there exists an embedding of [formula] into H which identifies [formula] with [formula]. Thus [formula] is simply connected, which completes the proof.

As in [\cite=ct] and [\cite=GA-flasque], a t-resolution

[formula]

induces a "fundamental diagram"

[formula]

where M = T / μ and [formula]. This diagram induces, in turn, a canonical isomorphism in the derived category

[formula]

(cf. [\cite=GA-flasque]) and a canonical exact sequence

[formula]

where μ is the fundamental group of [formula]. Since μ is finite, [\eqref=fund-diag-seq] shows that the induced homomorphism [formula] is injective. Set

[formula]

Thus there exists an exact sequence of (étale, finitely generated) twisted constant S-group schemes

[formula]

Set

[formula]

A t-resolution [formula] of a reductive S-group scheme G induces an exact sequence of finitely generated twisted constant S-group schemes

[formula]

The proof is similar to that of [\cite=ct], using [\eqref=fund-diag-seq].

Let G be a reductive S-group scheme and let be two t-resolutions of G. A morphism from [formula] to [formula], written [formula], is a commutative diagram

[formula]

where [formula] and φH are S-homomorphisms. Note that, if [formula] and [formula], then φH induces an S-homomorphism [formula].

We shall say that a t-resolution [formula] of G dominates another t-resolution [formula] of G if there exists a morphism [formula].

The following lemma is well-known.

A morphism of complexes f:P  →  Q in an abelian category is a quasi-isomorphism if and only its cone C(f) is acyclic (i.e., has trivial cohomology).

By [\cite=GM] there exists a short exact sequence of complexes

[formula]

where Cyl(f) is the cylinder of f. Further, the complex Cyl(f) is canonically isomorphic to Q in the derived category. Now the short exact sequence [\eqref=e:cyl-cone] induces a cohomology exact sequence

[formula]

from which the lemma is immediate.

Let g:C  →  D be a quasi-isomorphism of bounded complexes of split S-tori. Then the induced morphism of complexes of cocharacter S-group schemes g*:C*  →  D* is a quasi-isomorphism.

Since the assertion is local in the étale topology, we may and do assume that S is connected. The given quasi-isomorphism induces a quasi-isomorphism g*:D*  →  C* of bounded complexes of free and finitely generated constant S-group schemes. Thus, by [\eqref=char-cochar], it suffices to check that the functor [formula] on the category of bounded complexes of free and finitely generated constant S-group schemes preserves quasi-isomorphisms. We thank Joseph Bernstein for the following argument. By Lemma [\ref=l:quasi] a morphism f:P  →  Q of bounded complexes in the (abelian) category of finitely generated constant S-group schemes is a quasi-isomorphism if and only if its cone C(f) is acyclic. Now, if f:P  →  Q is a quasi-isomorphism and P and Q are bounded complexes of free and finitely generated constant S-group schemes, then C(f) is an acyclic complex of free and finitely generated constant S-group schemes. We see immediately that the dual complex

[formula]

is acyclic, whence [formula] is a quasi-isomorphism by Lemma [\ref=l:quasi].

Let G be a reductive S-group scheme and let [formula] be a t-resolution of G which dominates another t-resolution [formula] of G. Then a morphism of t-resolutions [formula] induces an isomorphism of finitely generated twisted constant S-group schemes [formula] which is independent of the choice of φ.

Let [formula] and [formula] be the given t-resolutions of G, as in Definition [\ref=def_morph-resol], and set [formula] and [formula]. Since the assertion is local in the étale topology, we may and do assume that the tori [formula] and [formula] are split and that S is connected. From [\eqref=fund-diag-seq] we see that the morphism of complexes of split tori (in degrees 0 and 1)

[formula]

is a quasi-isomorphism. Now by Lemma [\ref=lem:Bernstein],

[formula]

is an isomorphism. In order to show that this isomorphism does not depend on the choice of φ, assume that [formula] is another morphism of t-resolutions. It is clear from diagram [\eqref=e:morphism] that ψH differs from φH by some homomorphism [formula] which factors through [formula]. It follows that the induced homomorphisms [formula] differ by a homomorphism which factors through T*. Consequently, the induced homomorphisms

[formula]

coincide.

Let κ:G1  →  G2 be a homomorphism of reductive S-group schemes and let be t-resolutions of G1 and G2, respectively. Then there exists an exact commutative diagram

[formula]

where the middle row is a t-resolution of [formula].

We follow an idea of Kottwitz [\cite=kott]. Let [formula], where the morphism H1  →  G2 is the composition [formula]. Clearly, there are canonical morphisms [formula] and [formula]. Now, since H2  →  G2 is faithfully flat, so also is [formula]. Consequently the composition [formula] is faithfully flat as well. Let [formula] denote its kernel, i.e., [formula]. Then

[formula]

which is an S-torus. The existence of diagram [\eqref=diag:Kottwitz] is now clear. Further, since Ti is central in Hi (i = 1,2), [formula] is central in [formula]. The S-group scheme [formula] is affine and smooth over S and has connected reductive fibers, i.e., is a reductive S-group scheme. Further, the faithfully flat morphism [formula] induces a surjection [formula] with (central) kernel [formula]. Since [formula] is semisimple, the last map is in fact a central isogeny. Consequently, [formula] is a central isogeny as well, whence [formula] is simply connected. Thus the middle row of [\eqref=diag:Kottwitz] is indeed a t-resolution of G1.

Let [formula] and [formula] be two t-resolutions of a reductive S-group scheme G. Then there exists a t-resolution [formula] of [formula] which dominates both [formula] and [formula].

This is immediate from Proposition [\ref=prop:Kottwitz] (with G1 = G2 = G and κ  =  idG there).

Let [formula] and [formula] be two t-resolutions of a reductive S-group scheme G. Then there exists a canonical isomorphism of finitely generated twisted constant S-group schemes [formula].

By Corollary [\ref=cor:domination], there exists a t-resolution [formula] of [formula] and morphisms of resolutions [formula] and [formula]. Thus, Lemma [\ref=lem:induced-hom] gives a composite isomorphism [formula]. Let [formula] be another t-resolution of G which dominates both [formula] and [formula] and let [formula] be the corresponding composite isomorphism. There exists a t-resolution [formula] which dominates both [formula] and [formula]. Then [formula] dominates [formula] and [formula] and we obtain a composite isomorphism [formula]. We have a diagram of t-resolutions

[formula]

which may not commute. However, by Lemma [\ref=lem:induced-hom], this diagram induces a commutative diagram of twisted constant S-group schemes and their isomorphisms

[formula]

We conclude that

[formula]

from which we deduce the existence of a canonical isomorphism [formula].

Let G be a reductive S-group scheme. Using the preceding lemma, we shall henceforth identify the S-group schemes [formula] as [formula] ranges over the family of all t-resolutions of G. Their common value will be denoted by π1(G) and called the algebraic fundamental group of G. Thus

[formula]

for any t-resolution [formula] of G.

Note that, by [\eqref=t-r-p1], a t-resolution 1  →  T  →  H  →  G  →  1 of G induces an exact sequence

[formula]

Further, by Proposition [\ref=mu-p1-gtor], there exists a canonical exact sequence

[formula]

One can also define π1(G) using m-resolutions. By an m-resolution of G we mean a short exact sequence

[formula]

where H is a reductive S-group scheme such that [formula] is simply connected, and M is an S-group scheme of multiplicative type. Clearly, a t-resolution of G is in particular an m-resolution of G. It is very easy to see that any reductive S-group scheme G admits an m-resolution: we can take [formula], with the homomorphism H  →  G from the beginning of the proof of Proposition [\ref=ex-t-resol], and set [formula], which is a finite S-group scheme of multiplicative type.

Now let [formula] be an m-resolution of G and consider the induced homomorphism [formula]. We claim that there exists a complex of S-tori T  →  R which is isomorphic to [formula] in the derived category. Indeed, by [\cite=cnrd] there exists an embedding [formula] of M into an S-torus T. Denote by R the pushout of the homomorphisms [formula] and M  →  T. Then the complex of S-tori T  →  R is quasi-isomorphic to the complex [formula], as claimed.

Now we choose an m-resolution [formula] of G, a complex of S-tori T  →  R which is isomorphic to [formula] in the derived category, and set [formula].

Functoriality and exactness of π1

In this section we show that π1 is an exact covariant functor from the category of reductive S-group schemes to the category of finitely generated twisted constant S-group schemes.

Let κ:G1  →  G2 be a homomorphism of reductive S-group schemes. A t-resolution of κ, written [formula], is an exact commutative diagram

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] are t-resolutions of G1 and G2, respectively.

Thus, if G is a reductive S-group scheme and [formula] and [formula] are two t-resolutions of G, then a morphism from [formula] to [formula] (as in Definition [\ref=def_morph-resol]) is a t-resolution of idG:G  →  G.

A t-resolution [formula] of κ:G1  →  G2 induces a homomorphism of finitely generated twisted constant S-group schemes

[formula]

If G3 is a third reductive S-group scheme, λ:G2  →  G3 is an S-homomorphism and [formula] is a t-resolution of λ, then [formula] is a t-resolution of [formula] and

[formula]

Let κ:G1  →  G2 be a homomorphism of reductive S-group schemes and let [formula] be a t-resolution of G2. Then there exists a t-resolution [formula] of κ for a suitable choice of t-resolution [formula] of G1. In particular, every homomorphism of reductive S-group schemes admits a t-resolution.

Choose any t-resolution [formula] of G1 and apply Proposition [\ref=prop:Kottwitz] to κ, [formula] and [formula].

Let κ:G1  →  G2 be a homomorphism of reductive S-group schemes and let [formula] and [formula] be two t-resolutions of κ. A morphism from [formula] to [formula], written [formula], is a commutative diagram

[formula]

where the left-hand vertical arrow is a t-resolution of idG1 and the right-hand vertical arrow is a t-resolution of idG2. By a t-resolution dominating a t-resolution [formula] of κ we mean a t-resolution [formula] of κ admitting a morphism [formula].

If [formula] and [formula] are two t-resolutions of a morphism κ:G1  →  G2, then there exists a third t-resolution [formula] of κ which dominates both [formula] and [formula].

By Corollary [\ref=cor:domination], there exists a t-resolution [formula] of G2 which dominates both [formula] and [formula]. On the other hand, by Lemma [\ref=lem:resol-of-morph], there exists a t-resolution [formula] of κ for a suitable choice of t-resolution [formula] of G1. Now a second application of Corollary [\ref=cor:domination] yields a t-resolution [formula] of G1 which dominates [formula], [formula] and [formula]. Let [formula] be the corresponding morphism, which is a t-resolution of idG1. Then [formula] is a t-resolution of κ which dominates both [formula] and [formula].

Let [formula] be homomorphisms of reductive S-group schemes. Then

[formula]

Choose a t-resolution [formula] of G3. Applying Lemma [\ref=lem:resol-of-morph] first to λ and then to κ, we obtain t-resolutions [formula] of κ and λ, and the composition [formula] is a t-resolution of [formula]. Thus, by Remark [\ref=rem:123],

[formula]

as claimed.

Summarizing, for any non-empty scheme S, we have constructed a covariant functor π1 from the category of reductive S-group schemes to the category of finitely generated twisted constant S-group schemes. Now assume that S is admissible in the sense of [\cite=GA-flasque] (i.e., reduced, connected, locally Noetherian and geometrically unibranch), so that every reductive S-group scheme admits a flasque resolution [\cite=GA-flasque]. In this case the functor π1 defined here in terms of t-resolutions coincides with the functor π1 defined in [\cite=GA-flasque] in terms of flasque resolutions, because a flasque resolution is a particular case of a t-resolution. A basic example of a non-admissible scheme S to which the constructions of the present paper apply, but not those of [\cite=GA-flasque], is an algebraic curve over a field having an ordinary double point. See [\cite=GA-flasque].

The following result generalizes [\cite=BKG], [\cite=ct] and [\cite=GA-flasque].

Let 1  →  G1  →  G2  →  G3  →  1 be an exact sequence of reductive S-group schemes. Then the induced sequence of finitely generated twisted constant S-group schemes

[formula]

is exact.

The proof is similar to that of [\cite=GA-flasque] using the exact sequence [\eqref=mu-p1g-gtor]. Namely, one first proves the theorem when G1 is semisimple using the same arguments as in the proof of [\cite=GA-flasque] (those arguments rely on [\cite=GA-flasque], which is valid over any non-empty base scheme S). Secondly, one proves the theorem when G1 is an S-torus using the same arguments as in the proof of [\cite=GA-flasque] (which rely on [\cite=GA-flasque], which again holds over any non-empty base scheme S). Finally, the theorem is obtained by combining these two particular cases as in the proof of [\cite=GA-flasque].

We shall now present a second proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:pi1-exact] which relies on the étale-local existence of maximal tori in reductive S-group schemes. To this end, we shall first show that if G is a reductive S-group scheme which contains a maximal torus T, then T canonically determines a t-resolution of G.

Let G be a reductive S-group scheme having a maximal S-torus T, and set [formula], it is a maximal S-torus of [formula]. Then there exists a t-resolution of G

[formula]

such that [formula] is canonically isomorphic to T.

By [\cite=GA-flasque], the product in G and the canonical epimorphism [formula] induce a faithfully flat homomorphism [formula] whose (central) kernel μ1 embeds into [formula] via the canonical projection [formula]. In particular, we have a central extension

[formula]

Since [formula] by [\cite=sga3], we obtain an embedding [formula]. Let H be the pushout of [formula] and [formula], i.e., the cokernel of the central embedding

[formula]

Now let [formula] be the unit section of [formula] and set

[formula]

Composing j with the canonical isomorphism [formula], we obtain an S-morphism [formula] which induces an embedding [formula]. Further, let [formula] be the homomorphism which is induced by the projection

[formula]

Then we obtain a t-resolution of G

[formula]

which is canonically determined by T (cf. the proof of Proposition [\ref=ex-t-resol]). It remains to show that [formula] is canonically isomorphic to T. Let [formula] and [formula] be the unit sections of [formula] and [formula], respectively, and consider the homomorphism

[formula]

Composing this homomorphism with the canonical isomorphism [formula], we obtain a canonical embedding [formula]. The latter map induces a homomorphism [formula] which identifies [formula] with [formula]. Now consider the composite homomorphism

[formula]

Then [formula] is isomorphic to the cokernel of the central embedding

[formula]

Compare [\eqref=e:H-push]. Finally, the canonical embedding [formula] induces an embedding [formula] (see [\eqref=e:G-push] and [\eqref=e:Ht-push]) whose image is [formula] [\cite=sga3]. This completes the proof.

It is clear from the above proof that the homomorphism [formula] induced by the t-resolution [formula] of Lemma [\ref=c:t-special] is the canonical homomorphism [formula].

Let G be a reductive S-group scheme containing a maximal S-torus T. The algebraic fundamental group of the pair (G,T) is the S-group scheme [formula].

By Lemma [\ref=c:t-special] and Definition [\ref=def:pi_1] we have a canonical isomorphism

[formula]

Further, any morphism of pairs κ:(G1,T1)  →  (G2,T2) (in the obvious sense) induces an S-homomorphism κ*:π1(G1,T1)  →  π1(G2,T2). It can be shown that the following diagram commutes:

[formula]

This is immediate in the case where κ is a normal homomorphism, i.e. κ(G1) is normal in G2 (this is the only case needed in this paper). Indeed, in this case we have [formula] and therefore κ induces a morphism of t-resolutions [formula]. See the proof of Lemma [\ref=c:t-special].

The preceding considerations and Lemma [\ref=lem:can-isom] show that, if S is an admissible scheme in the sense of [\cite=GA-flasque], so that every reductive S-group scheme G admits a flasque resolution [formula], and G contains a maximal S-torus T, then there exists a canonical isomorphism [formula]. This fact generalizes [\cite=ct], which is the case [formula], where k is a field, of the present remark.

Let

[formula]

be an exact sequence of reductive S-group schemes with maximal tori. Then the sequence of étale, finitely generated twisted constant S-group schemes

[formula]

is exact.

The assertion of the lemma is local for the étale topology, so we may and do assume that T1, T2, and T3 are split. By [\cite=GA-flasque], there exists an exact commutative diagram of reductive S-group schemes

[formula]

which induces an exact commutative diagram of split S-tori

[formula]

where [formula] (i = 1,2,3). Now, as in [\cite=BKG], diagram [\eqref=e:d-T] induces an exact commutative diagram of constant S-group schemes with injective vertical arrows. An application of the snake lemma to the last diagram now yields the exact sequence

[formula]

which is the assertion of the lemma.

Let 1  →  G1  →  G2  →  G3  →  1 be an exact sequence of reductive S-group schemes. By [\cite=sga3], for any reductive S-group scheme G there exists an étale covering {Sα  →  S}α∈A such that each [formula] contains a split maximal Sα-torus Tα. Thus, since the assertion of the theorem is local for the étale topology, we may and do assume that G2 contains a split maximal S-torus T2. Let T1 = G1  ×  G2T2 and let T3 be the cokernel of T1  →  T2. Then Ti is a split maximal S-torus of Gi for i = 1,2,3 and we have an exact sequence of pairs

[formula]

Now the theorem follows from Lemma [\ref=lem:mt-exact], [\eqref=p1gt=p1g] and [\eqref=p1gt] [\eqref=p1g] [\eqref=morph].

Abelian cohomology and t-resolutions

Let [formula] (respectively, [formula]) be the small fppf (respectively, étale) site over S. If F1 and F2 are abelian sheaves on [formula] (regarded as complexes concentrated in degree 0), [formula] (respectively, [formula]) will denote the total tensor product (respectively, right derived Hom functor) of F1 and F2 in the derived category of the category of abelian sheaves on [formula].

Let G be a reductive group scheme over S. For any integer i  ≥   - 1, the i-th abelian (flat) cohomology group of G is by definition the hypercohomology group

[formula]

On the other hand, the i-th dual abelian cohomology group of [formula] is the group

[formula]

Here all the complexes of length 2 are in degrees ( - 1,0). See [\cite=GA-flasque] for basic properties of these cohomology groups and [\cite=bor] [\cite=ga2] [\cite=ga3] for (some of) their arithmetical applications.

The following result is an immediate consequence of [\eqref=q-iso].

Let G be a reductive S-group scheme and let 1  →  T  →  H  →  G  →  1 be a t-resolution of G. Then the given t-resolution defines isomorphisms [formula] and [formula], where [formula]. Further, there exist exact sequences

[formula]

and

[formula]

Let G be a reductive S-group scheme. Then, for every integer i  ≥   - 1, there exist isomorphisms

[formula]

and

[formula]

This follows from Proposition [\ref=prop-cohom] in the same way as [\cite=GA-flasque] follows from [\cite=GA-flasque].

Let 1  →  G1  →  G2  →  G3  →  1 be an exact sequence of reductive S-group schemes. Then there exist exact sequences of abelian groups

[formula]

and

[formula]

This follows from Corollary [\ref=cor-pi1] and Theorem [\ref=thm:pi1-exact].
