Normal forms for singular holomorphic Engel systems

Introduction

A germ of holomorphic Pfaff system of codimension k on [formula] is a subsheaf I of the cotangent sheaf [formula] of [formula] spanned by k germs of holomorphic differential 1-forms [formula] assumed generically linearly independent near 0. We will write [formula]. This system can be represented by the holomorphic k-form [formula] The singular set of I is the analytic subset given by

[formula]

Therefore [formula] is defined by k  ×  k determinants of an n  ×  k matrix. Therefore, each irreducible component has codimension at most k  +  1. We say that the singular set of I has expected codimension if it has a component of codimension k + 1.

Let [formula] be a germ of analytic subset in [formula] of codimension ≤  k, with zeros ideal [formula]. If [formula], then we denote by [formula] the Pfaff system spanned by [formula].

We say that [formula] is an integral variety of [formula] if and only if

[formula]

A Pfaff system I is integrable if and only if

[formula]

If I is integrable, by the classical Frobenius's Theorem, for all points or all points [formula] there exists an integral complex analytic manifold of codimension k passing through p. In [\cite=Malgrange] B. Malgrange obtained a Frobenius's Theorem for singular integrable systems with singular set of codimension ≥  3, showing the existence of integral varieties passing through the singular points of the system.

For a germ of Pfaff system I, we can define its derived flag [formula] by the relations I(0)  =  I and

[formula]

Then, the derived flag of a Pfaff system I is defined inductively by the exact sequence

[formula]

Since the codimension of each Pfaff system I(i) is generically constant then there will be an integer N such that I(N)  =  I(N + 1). This integer N is called the derived length of I. The Pfaff system I(N) is always integrable by definition since

[formula]

If I(N) = 0 we say that the system I is completely nonholonomic. See [\cite=BCGGG] for more details.

A contact system on [formula] is a completely nonholonomic system. The classical Darboux-Pfaff theorem gives a normal form for non-singular contact system. That is, if I is a non-singular contact system, then there exist a germ of coordinate system on [formula] such that

[formula]

In [\cite=C] D. Cerveau provided a singular version of the Pfaff-Darboux Theorem. More precisely, Let β be a germ of holomorphic 1-form in [formula]. We define the class of β to be the integer r for which

[formula]

In this work we are interested in completely nonholonomic system on [formula] of codimension 2 and derived length equal to 2.

We can see that a germ of Engel system in [formula] is a system of codimension 2 such that, for 0  ≤  i  ≤  2, the elements of its derived flag satisfy cod(I(i)) = 2 - i. In fact, I(0)  =  〈α,β〉, I(1)  =  〈β〉 and I(2) = 0. Thus, an Engel system has derived length equal to 2.

In the real non-singular case, these Pfaff systems were introduced by E. von Weber in 1898 and studied by several authors [\cite=Cartan][\cite=GKR][\cite=PR]. F. Engel [\cite=Engel] shows that a non-singular Engel system is locally isomorphic, at a generic point, to the canonical system

[formula]

That is, F. Engel provides a kind of Pfaff-Darboux type theorem for non-singular Pfaff systems of codimension 2 and derived length equal to 2. M. Zhitomirskii in [\cite=Z] obtained normal forms for real non-singular Engel along non generic points.

The canonical system appears naturally as a system called canonical contact system on the space [formula] of 2-jets of holomorphic maps of [formula], see [\cite=PR]. Nonsingular global holomorphic Engel systems have been studied by L. Sol� Conde and F. Presa in [\cite=PS].

We prove the following result for germs of holomorphic Engels system in [formula]

We note that the only place the dimension assumption is used in the proof is to guarantee that [formula]. Therefore, we obtain the following result which will be useful in application to Engel systems on four dimensional projective spaces.

Let I  =  〈α,β〉 be a Pfaff system of codimension 2 on [formula] satisfying the following conditions:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula] and [formula]

If [formula] and [formula], then there exist [formula] such that

[formula]

Normal forms allows us to prove the existence of integral submanifolds. An interesting consequence of Theorem [\ref=teo] is the existence of an integral analytic curve passing through the singular points of the system.

In fact, it follows from Theorem [\ref=teo] that the analytic curve {f1 = f3 = f4 = 0} is a solution of I  =  〈df4 - f3df1,df3 - f2df1〉.

Finally, we give Another application of Theorem [\ref=teo] for globally decomposable Engel system on four dimensional projective space.

It is well known that all codimension one integrable systems in [formula] have in its singular set an irreducible component of codimension two.

Let I be a codimension one integrable system on a Fano manifold such that [formula]. In [\cite=LPT] F. Loray, J. V. Pereira and F Touzet show that if the canonical class of I is numerically trivial then its singular set has a component of codimension two.

A similar situation appears in the study of singularities of Poisson structures on Fano manifolds motivated by Bondal's conjecture [\cite=Bondal] [\cite=Be]. A. Polishchuk in [\cite=Po] showed that the rank of a nondegenerate Poisson structure on a Fano variety of odd dimension drops along a subset of codimension two.

As an application of Theorem [\ref=teo] we prove that a globally decomposable Engel system on four dimensional projective space has a singular set with atypical codimension. In fact, the expected codimension of the singular set of a Pfaff system of codimension 2 should be 3. But, the following Theorem shows that the singular set of these systems has codimension ≤  2.

Proof of the Theorem [\ref=teo]

Since [formula] and [formula], we have that β has class 1. By Theorem [\ref=Pfaff-Cerveau], there exist f1,f3,f4∈O40 such that

[formula]

In particular, [formula]. Now, since [formula] we get

[formula]

This implies that there exist germs of holomorphic funtions [formula] and [formula] on [formula] such that

[formula]

Since the codimension of [formula] is bigger than 2, by Hartorgs' extension Theorem we have the identity

[formula]

on [formula] Now if either a  =  0 or b = 0, then [formula], a contradiction to Engel's conditions. Thus a  ≠  0 and b  ≠  0, and therefore

[formula]

and if we set [formula] then

[formula]

Thus,

[formula]

Now, we will prove that the map [formula] defined by f1,f2,f3,f4) is a biholomorphism outside [formula]. That is, we prove that

[formula]

never vanishes outside [formula]. Differentiating the identity

[formula]

we get

[formula]

Multiplying this identity by [formula] we obtain

[formula]

since [formula]. Thus

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

Using that α = adf1 + bdf3  +  λβ and β = df4 - f3df1 and substituting in [formula] we conclude that

[formula]

is nowhere vanishing outside [formula]

Application to Engel systems on projective spaces

A Pfaff system I of codimension k on a complex projective space [formula] is a locally decomposable section

[formula]

This means that for all [formula] there exists a neighborhood U of p and 1-forms [formula], such that [formula]

If [formula] is a generic linear immersion then [formula] is a section of a line bundle, and its divisor of zeros reflects the tangencies between I and [formula]. The degree of I is, by definition, the degree of such a tangency divisor. Set d: =  deg (I). Since [formula], one concludes that [formula].

We say that I is globally decomposable if [formula] for suitable [formula]

Besides, the Euler sequence implies that a section ω of [formula] can be thought of as a polynomial k-form on [formula] with homogeneous coefficients of degree d  +  1, which we will still denote by ω, satisfying

[formula]

where

[formula]

is the radial vector field. Thus the study of distributions of degree d on [formula] reduces to the study of locally decomposable homogeneous k-forms of degree d + 1 on [formula] satisfying the relation ([\ref=equirw]).

We will use the following Jouanolou's Lemma.

As an application of Theorem [\ref=teo] we prove that a globally decomposable Engel system on four dimensional projective space has a singular set with atypical codimension. In fact, the expected codimension of the singular set of a codimension 2 should be 3. But, the following Theorem shows that the singular set of these systems has codimension ≤  2.

Firstly we observe that on [formula] all holomorphic 1-forms [formula] satisfy [formula] In fact, [formula] is a 5-form on [formula].

Suppose that [formula] and [formula]. Then, it follows from Corollary [\ref=coro] that there exist homogeneous polynomials f1,f2,f3,f4 on [formula] such that

[formula]

In particular, we have that [formula] and [formula].

Since iRα = iRβ = 0, we conclude that k4f4 - k1f3f1 = k3f3 - k1f2f1 = 0, where ki  =   deg (fi), i = 1,3,4. These relations imply that

[formula]

This is a contradiction. On the other hand, suppose that [formula]. By lemma [\ref=Jouanolou] we have

[formula]

since iRβ = 0. Using this relation we have that

[formula]

We conclude that [formula] has a component of codimension two.
