Abstract

We construct non-standard interactions between exterior form gauge fields by gauging a particular global symmetry of the Einstein-Maxwell action for such fields. Furthermore we discuss generalizations of such interactions by adding couplings to gravitational Chern-Simons forms and to fields arising through dimensional reduction. The construction uses an appropriate tensor calculus.

Introduction

Exterior form gauge fields [formula] generalize naturally the electromagnetic gauge potential and are therefore interesting on general grounds in the context of gauge theories. In particular they play a substantial rôle in supergravity models and string theory. It is therefore natural to study consistent interactions of such gauge fields, both the interactions between themselves and their couplings to other fields.

In this paper we construct non-standard interactions of exterior form gauge fields. This is done in curved spacetime, i.e. the coupling to the gravitational field is included as well. Our starting point is the Einstein-Maxwell action for a p-form gauge field Ap and an (n - p - 1)-form gauge field An - p - 1 in n-dimensional spacetime (for arbitrary p and n). This action has a global symmetry which shifts Ap by the hodge dual of the field strength of An - p - 1, and An - p - 1 by the hodge dual of the field strength of Ap (with an appropriate sign factor, see below). We gauge this global symmetry, using an additional 1-form gauge field V = dxμVμ. This yields inevitably interactions which are non-polynomial in the Vμ. It would therefore be cumbersome to construct these interactions in a pedestrian way via the standard Noether procedure. Instead, we employ an appropriate tensor calculus which is analogous to the one introduced in [\cite=BD] in flat four-dimensional spacetime. By formulating this tensor calculus in the differential form language we simplify the construction considerably as compared to the formulation in terms of components used in [\cite=BD].

The resulting interactions can be generalized in several ways. We shall describe two such generalizations arising in gravitational theories: (a) additional couplings of p-form gauge fields to gravitational Chern-Simons forms; (b) couplings to additional vector gauge fields and scalar fields arising by standard Kaluza-Klein type dimensional reduction.

Our work is linked to recent progress in four-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories, and theories with exterior form gauge fields in general. To our knowledge, gauge theories of the type constructed here appeared for the first time in [\cite=CdWFKST]. There four-dimensional N = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories were constructed in which the central charge of the vector-tensor multiplet is gauged. This central charge is a global symmetry of the type described above and therefore the models found in [\cite=CdWFKST] contain interactions of the same non-standard type as those we shall obtain. Further four-dimensional N = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories of the same type were constructed in [\cite=VT]. The vector-tensor multiplet with gauged central charged is believed to arise in N = 2 heterotic string vacua [\cite=string]. Interactions of the type studied here may therefore be relevant in that context, among other things.

Independently of these developments related to the N = 2 vector-tensor multiplet, models of the type considered here, and generalizations thereof, were discovered in [\cite=HK] (along with further new interactions of exterior form gauge fields) within a systematic classification of possible consistent interaction vertices of exterior form gauge fields. Four-dimensional N = 1 supersymmetric versions of some of these models were constructed in [\cite=BT]. Our work thus adds to the list of new gauge theories in these references.

The Basic Model

The properly normalized Einstein-Maxwell action for Ap and An - p - 1 is

[formula]

Here we use the following conventions for a p-form ωp and its Hodge dual:

[formula]

where indices are raised with the inverse metric Gμν, and the curved Levi-Civita tensor is defined by (x1 labels the time coordinate) One should of course add the Einstein action to S0, which however we shall not write explicitly.

S0 has among others a global symmetry generated by

[formula]

The corresponding Noether current, written in dual notation as an (n - 1)-form, is

[formula]

We remark that the global symmetry Δ and its current J are non-trivial, see comments at the end of the paper.

We will now try to gauge this symmetry. To do this, we search for a modified generator Δ', such that Δ'Ap and Δ'An - p - 1 transform covariantly under gauge transformations

[formula]

where ε is an arbitrary scalar field and g a coupling constant of mass dimension - 1.

A reasonable ansatz is to replace the exterior derivative in [\eqref=DeA] with a covariant one. Let us therefore introduce a connection 1-form V with the standard transformation law

[formula]

and a covariant derivative

[formula]

where Δ' is the covariant version of [\eqref=DeA],

[formula]

These equations give the action of Δ' only implicitly because D involves Δ'. We now determine the covariant derivatives DAp and DAn - p - 1. Starting with the former, we have

[formula]

Using the identity

[formula]

which holds for any p-form ωp (where Vμ  =  GμνVν), this gives To solve for DAp, we have to invert the operator 1  +  g2ViV. With (ViV)2  =  VμVμ  ViV, it is easily verified that

[formula]

and we obtain

[formula]

Analogously, one finds

[formula]

Note that due to the appearance of E- 1 the covariant derivatives, and thus the gauge transformations, of Ap and An - p - 1 are non-polynomial in the connection Vμ and the coupling constant g.

As can be checked, DAp and DAn - p - 1 are indeed covariant, i.e. their gauge transformations do not involve derivatives of ε, and one has

[formula]

Now we can proceed to construct the gauge invariant action. To do this, we use the following fact: let X be a covariant volume form which transforms according to δεX  =  g  εDK, with K a covariant (n - 1)-form. Then X  +  g  VK transforms into a total derivative,

[formula]

In particular, thanks to [\eqref=deDA] this applies to

[formula]

with

[formula]

Adding a kinetic term for the connection V, the action thus reads

[formula]

with X and K as in [\eqref=X] and [\eqref=K]. By construction, δεS is a surface term, with the transformations as in [\eqref=deA], [\eqref=deV] and δεGμν  =  0. Furthermore, the action is invariant under the standard spacetime diffeomorphisms and the abelian gauge transformations of Ap and An - p - 1,

[formula]

since these fields enter the covariant derivatives [\eqref=DAp], [\eqref=DAn-p-1] only via their exterior derivatives.

Alternatively, one may consider a first order formulation. Introducing auxiliary fields βp and βn - p - 1, with the form degree as indicated, the action is given by

[formula]

while the gauge transformations read The equations of motion for the auxiliary fields are coupled in exactly the same way as the equations that determine the covariant derivatives of Ap and An - p - 1,

[formula]

and the solutions are thus

[formula]

The action [\eqref=action2] may also be used to derive a dual version of our model. To that end one solves the equations of motion for Ap and An - p - 1 through βp = dAp - 1 and βn - p - 1 = dAn - p - 2 and inserts the solution back into the action. The interaction vertex Vβpβn - p - 1 then turns into a Chern-Simons term.

Remark. If n = 1 + 4k and p = 2k, one may identify Ap with An - p - 1. For instance, in the case n = 5, p = 2 one then gets a 5-dimensional theory involving only one 2-form gauge field besides V and the gravitational field.

Generalizations

Coupling to Gravitational Chern-Simons Forms

We shall now discuss how the basic model introduced above can be generalized by including couplings of p-form gauge potentials to gravitational Chern-Simons forms.

We denote a gravitational Chern-Simons p-form by qp, where [formula], or p = n - 1 in n = 2k dimensional spacetime (the latter case corresponds to the Euler density in even dimensional spacetime). So, for instance, in 5-dimensional spacetime there is only one gravitational Chern-Simons form, q3, which satisfies dq3  =  RρσRσρ, where [formula] (explicitly one has [formula], where Γρσ  =  dxμΓμρσ). In 4-dimensional spacetime there are two independent gravitational Chern-Simons 3-forms, q3 and q'3, satisfying dq3  =  RρσRσρ and dq'3  =  εμνρσRμνRρσ respectively.

In a first order formulation, a gravitational Chern-Simons (p + 1)-form can be coupled to a p-form gauge potential through the following extension of the action [\eqref=action2],

[formula]

This action is invariant under the gauge transformations [\eqref=trafo1] and [\eqref=trafo2], and the following modification of the spacetime diffeomorphisms,

[formula]

where Lξ is the standard Lie derivative along the vector field ξμ (with [formula] etc.), and rp is the p-form whose exterior derivative is the non-covariant part of δξqp + 1,

[formula]

So for q3 as above, one gets r2  =  ∂μξνdΓνμ, for instance. As usual, the combination dAp + qp + 1 transforms covariantly under δξ, δξ(dAp + qp + 1) = Lξ(dAp + qp + 1), and therefore the action [\eqref=action22] is indeed invariant under δξ.

From the above formulae one easily infers the second order version of the action and the gauge transformations in presence of Chern-Simons couplings. It is simply obtained from [\eqref=deA] and [\eqref=S] by substituting dAp + qp + 1 for dAp everywhere. Note that this results in the presence of the gravitational Chern-Simons form qp + 1 both in δεAp and δεAn - p - 1.

Dimensional Reduction

We shall now perform a dimensional reduction from n to n - 1 dimensions. This gives rise to couplings to additional gauge fields and scalars. We shall discuss explicitly only the dimensional reduction of the basic model. The extension to more involved models, such as those with additional Chern-Simons couplings, is straightforward.

We denote the coordinates by

[formula]

and take all fields to be constant along the xn-direction. Then the metric decomposes in the usual manner,

[formula]

where W  =  dxaWa is a 1-form in n - 1 dimensions.

Upon dimensional reduction, Ap gives rise to a p-form Âp and a (p - 1)-form Âp - 1, while An - p - 1 decomposes into an (n - p - 1)-form Ân - p - 1 and an (n - p - 2)-form Ân - p - 2. The connection V introduces in addition to a 1-form V̂ a scalar field φ,

[formula]

In the following, one should keep in mind that the descendants Âp, Ân - p - 1 and V̂ all transform non-trivially under the abelian gauge transformation associated with W, while Âp - 1, Ân - p - 2 and φ are invariant, δλ originates from a general coordinate transformation in the nth direction.

When decomposing the dual of a p-form ωp, we make use of the relation where the Hodge star [formula] in n - 1 dimensions involves the reduced Levi-Civita tensor [formula] and indices are raised with gab.

There are now two ways of determining the covariant derivatives and gauge transformations of the Â-fields, which turn out to give the same results. One may either start from the first order formulation and solve the dimensionally reduced equations of motion for the auxiliary fields, or one may directly decompose the equations [\eqref=DAp] and [\eqref=DAn-p-1]. Let us follow the latter approach: we define a covariant derivative [formula] by the relations

[formula]

The decomposition of the left-hand sides is straightforward, and by comparison of the terms with and without dxn one derives the action of [formula] on the four gauge fields. Similarly to the gauge fields themselves, the descendants Âp and Ân - p - 1 transform non-covariantly under δλ. It is convenient to use δλ-invariant generalized field strengths instead, analogous to those appearing in Kaluza-Klein supergravity models (see e.g. [\cite=DNP]),

[formula]

Then also the connection V̂ appears always in a δλ-invariant combination, which we denote by

[formula]

Since the original n-dimensional fields do not appear anymore, we shall omit all hats in the following. Explicitly, one finds

[formula]

and

[formula]

where now

[formula]

The above expressions enter the gauge transformations δε of the forms Ap etc., which are found to read

[formula]

while those of the remaining fields are simply

[formula]

We observe that DAp - 1 and DAn - p - 2 contain terms which are accompanied by the scalar φ rather than the connection U. One may introduce "minimal" covariant derivatives D of Ap - 1 and An - p - 2 by substracting appropriate covariant terms from DAp - 1 and DAn - p - 2,

[formula]

This results in the following simpler expressions:

[formula]

where E is a function of the scalar fields only,

[formula]

Equations [\eqref=Dmin] can be inverted to express DAp - 1 and DAn - p - 2 in terms of the minimal covariant derivatives,

[formula]

Finally, we obtain the gauge invariant action in (n - 1)-dimensional spacetime by reduction of equation [\eqref=S]. Using the equations [\eqref=F], [\eqref=U] and [\eqref=DDmin], it can be written entirely in terms of δλ-invariant as well as δε-covariant expressions,

[formula]

As compared to [\eqref=S], the new feature of the action [\eqref=DRaction] is the coupling of φ, φ and W. Indeed, if we set these fields to zero, [\eqref=DRaction] reduces to an action of the form [\eqref=S] in n' = n - 1 dimensions, for two pairs of exterior form gauge fields with form degrees (p,n' - p - 1) and (p - 1,n' - p): one gets [\eqref=S] with X = X1 + X2 and K = K1 + K2, where the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the first and second pair respectively (Xi and Ki match their counterparts in [\eqref=X] and [\eqref=K] up to sign factors which can be removed by trivial field redefinitions A  →    ±  A). Clearly, one may iterate the dimensional reduction procedure to derive more involved models of the above type. Again, after setting to zero scalar and vector fields coming from Gμν and V, the resulting actions reduce to the form [\eqref=S] for more pairs of exterior form gauge fields.

Comments

To understand the structure of the models, it is useful to keep in mind that they are consistent deformations of the standard Einstein-Maxwell action for exterior form gauge fields, plus kinetic terms for the additional fields in the models obtained by dimensional reduction. The non-polynomial structure and the non-triviality of the interactions can be traced to the properties of the global symmetry [\eqref=DeA] that is gauged.

Namely, to first order in the coupling constant g, the deformed Einstein-Maxwell action [\eqref=S] reads [formula], where J is the Noether current [\eqref=current]. Hence, S1 is nothing but the standard Noether coupling of the gauge field V to the conserved current of the global symmetry [\eqref=DeA]. The corresponding first order deformation of the gauge symmetry involves the global symmetry [\eqref=DeA] itself: it is just δ1  =  gεΔ (i.e. [formula], [formula]. It can be readily checked that δ1S1 does not vanish, due to the fact that J is not invariant under εΔ. Rather, one has δ1S1  ≈    -  δ0S2, where ≈   denotes weak equality (= "on-shell equality"), i.e. equality up to terms that involve the left hand sides of the equations of motion. As a consequence, consistency of the interactions at second order makes it necessary to introduce second order deformations both of the action and of the gauge symmetry (this can be rigorously proved by BRST cohomological arguments along the lines of [\cite=BH]). This extends to all higher orders and leads to the non-polynomial structure of the interactions and gauge transformations.

In fact the situation is somewhat similar to the coupling of the gravitational field to matter in standard gravity. Indeed, viewed as a deformation using [formula], the first order deformation couples hμν to the energy momentum tensor Tμν in flat spacetime. Tμν is the Noether current of translations and not invariant under the generators of translations given by the spacetime derivatives. This leads to interactions that are non-polynomial in hμν and in the coupling constant [formula] which are compactly constructed by means of the familiar tensor calculus.

The non-standard coupling of the p-form gauge potentials to scalar fields present in the dimensionally reduced models can be understood analogously from the point of view of consistent deformations. If we specialize these models by setting W and φ to zero, the first order coupling of the scalar field φ is just [formula] (up to a factor), i.e. it couples φ to the topological density dAp - 1dAn - p - 2. Again, the latter is not invariant under δ1. This enforces further interaction terms of higher order, with higher powers of φ, and eventually non-polynomial interactions of φ. Analogous statements apply in presence of W and φ, where further interactions are present. One may disentangle the various couplings in these interactions by introducing further coupling constants g1 and g2 through the rescalings W  →  g1W, φ  →  g2φ.

Hence, though one might have suspected that the non-polynomial interactions of the scalar fields (and of W) in the above models are just an artefact of the dimensional reduction, such interactions are actually to be expected in gauge theories of the type studied here, whether or not the models can be obtained by dimensional reduction. In fact, the reader may check that non-polynomial interactions of scalar fields similar to those found here are present in all supersymmetric models constructed in [\cite=CdWFKST] [\cite=VT] [\cite=BT].

Finally we comment briefly on the non-triviality of the deformations constructed here. Deformations of actions and gauge transformations are called trivial if they can be removed by mere field redefinitions. The non-triviality of the deformations constructed here traces to the non-triviality of the global symmetry Δ and its current J (again, this can be shown by BRST cohomological arguments).

In general, the non-triviality of conserved currents is concisely formulated in the so-called characteristic cohomology (see e.g. [\cite=char]) related to the equations of motion. This cohomology is defined through the cocycle condition dωp  ≈  0 and the coboundary condition ωp  ≈  dωp - 1, where ωp and ωp - 1 are local forms constructed of the fields and their derivatives (of first or higher order) and ≈   denotes weak equality as described above. In our case J is indeed a non-trivial cocycle of the characteristic cohomology related to the Einstein-Maxwell equations: it is conserved, dJ  ≈  0, and non-trivial since there is no local (n - 2)-form ωn - 2 such that J  ≈  dωn - 2.

This implies already that Δ is non-trivial too, because a global symmetry is trivial (= weakly equal to a gauge transformation) if and only if the corresponding Noether current is trivial in the characteristic cohomology [\cite=BBH] (when global subtleties are absent or irrelevant). In fact, in our case the non-triviality of Δ traces also directly to the characteristic cohomology: [formula] and [formula] are non-trivial in that cohomology (cf. [\cite=HKS]) and thus ΔAp and ΔAn - p - 1 are not weakly equal to a gauge transformation.

Remark. The non-triviality of J, [formula] and [formula] in the characteristic cohomology does not contradict the fact that these quantities are exact (at least locally) when one evaluates them for a specific solution to the equations of motion. In fact, by the ordinary Poincaré lemma, they are locally exact for any specific solution to the equations of motion since they are weakly closed. The latter statement applies of course to every cocycle of the characteristic cohomology (except for the constant 0-forms), and thus in particular to every Noether current, whether or not it is trivial. The point is that a form ωp which is trivial in the characteristic cohomology is weakly equal to dωp - 1 with a definite ωp - 1, that involves the fields and their derivatives and does not depend upon which solution to the equations of motion one considers.
