Constraining the Selectron Mass in the Process e-  +  γ  →  01  +  ẽ-L / R  →  e-0101

Presented at XIII. Summer School of Theoretical Physics, Ustron

Introduction

The electron-photon collision mode of an e+e- linear collider [\cite=PLC] provides us with the possibility to produce single selectrons in association with the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), which is assumed to be the lightest neutralino 01. Thus selectrons can be produced with masses beyond the kinematical range for pair production at an e+e- linear collider. Also the production mechanism (electron exchange in the s-channel and selectron exchange in the t-channel) for associated selectron-neutralino production is simpler than that for selectron pair production in e+e- collisions. Assuming a common scalar mass m0 at the unification point the masses of the selectrons are related to the MSSM parameters tan β and M2, the SU(2) gaugino mass parameter, by renormalization group equations [\cite=Polchinski]. In the MSSM quite generally the right selectron ẽR is lighter than the left selectron ẽL. In extended SUSY models, however, ẽR could be heavier than ẽL [\cite=extsusy]. We study in this paper the process e-γ  →  01ẽ-L / R  →  e-0101 with polarized beams. Since the cross section and the forward-backward asymmetry of the decay electron depend sensitively on the selectron masses this process is suitable for testing the renormalization group relation between mẽR and mẽL.

Cross Section and Forward-Backward Asymmetry

The associated production of selectrons and the LSP proceeds via e- exchange in the s-channel and ẽL / R exchange in the t-channel. In the narrow width approximation the total cross section σL / Reγ for the combined process of ẽ-L / R01 production and the subsequent decay ẽ-L / R  →  e-01 factorizes into the production cross section σP and the leptonic branching ratio:

[formula]

The measured cross section σL / Ree in the e+e- cms is obtained by folding σL / Reγ with the energy spectrum P(y) of the Compton backscattered laser beam taking into account the mean helicity of the photon beam [\cite=Py]:

[formula]

[formula]

Ac is the circular photon asymmetry and y = Eγ / Ee is the ratio of the photon energy and the energy of the converted electron beam. The energy spectrum [formula] and the mean helicity [formula] of the high energy photon beam sensitively depend on the polarizations λL of the laser beam and λk of the converted electron beam. Beyond the cross section σee  =  σLee  +  σRee, we study the forward-backward asymmetry of the decay electrons:

[formula]

The forward direction is defined by the electron beam.

Apart from the kinematics the selectron masses enter the cross sections and the forward-backward asymmetries explicitly via the selectron propagator in the t-channel. Assuming a common scalar mass m0 at the unification point the masses of the selectrons are related to the MSSM parameters tan β and the gaugino mass parameter M2 by renormalization group equations [\cite=Polchinski]:

[formula]

[formula]

In the MSSM quite generally the right selectron ẽR is lighter than the left selectron ẽL. In extended SUSY models these relations are changed as a consequence of additional D-terms in the scalar potential and the right selectron may be heavier than the left selectron.

In chapter 3 we study the dependence of the cross section σee and the forward-backward asymmetry AFB on mẽR and mẽL. We shall see that this process is useful for testing the GUT-relations equs. (5), (6).

Numerical Results

We present numerical results for the MSSM parameters M2 = 152 GeV, M1 = 78.7 GeV, μ = 316 GeV and tan β = 3 for the cms-energy [formula] GeV. The LSP is gaugino-like with m01 = 71.9 GeV. For mẽR = 127 GeV and mẽL = 171 GeV this corresponds to one ECFA/DESY reference scenario for the linear collider [\cite=refscen1]. Fig. 1 shows the total cross section σee and the forward-backward asymmetry AFB for λk =  + 1 and λL =  - 1. This choice of λk and λL leads to a strongly marked high energetic peak in the energy spectrum P(y) [\cite=Py] and therefore to maximal cross sections. For the electron beam in the eγ collision we choose in fig. 1a,b the polarization Pe = 0.9. Then due to [formula] the cross section for ẽR is enhanced whereas that for ẽL is strongly suppressed so that σee is nearly independent of mẽL. The cross section for this polarization configuration (fig. 1a) allows to constrain mẽR up to 344 GeV. In a region around 200 GeV the dependence of σee on mẽR is rather weak. In this case AFB (fig. 1b) gives additional informations on the mass mẽR. For mẽR > 344 GeV the production of right selectrons becomes impossible and due to the suppression by the polarization factor [formula] the cross section is rather small: σee  =  σLee  ~  2.5 fb for mẽL = 100 GeV. Then AFB only depends on σLee and is independent of mẽR (see fig. 1b).

For figs. 1c and 1d we choose Pe =  - 0.9. Now the production and decay of left selectrons is no longer neglectible. Fig. 1c gives the cross sections for three different masses mẽR = 100 GeV, 127 GeV, 200 GeV. In all three cases it should be possible to constrain mẽL up to 170 GeV. For masses larger than 170 GeV the dependence of σee on mẽL is too weak so that one obtains only a lower limit on mẽL. For large values of mẽR the measurement of the asymmetry AFB (fig. 1d) could be helpful to extend this mass range to somewhat higher values.

If the renormalization group relations equs. (5), (6) are satisfied then mẽL is larger than mẽR, m2ẽL - m2ẽR  ~  0.56M22. This relation can be tested with the total cross sections in figure 1a and 1c up to mẽL = 170 GeV, complementary to the measurements at an e+e--collider. Fig. 1d shows that for higher masses of ẽR the asymmetry could allow a test of the renormalization group relations, equs. (5),(6).

Conclusion

With a suitable choice of beam polarizations it is possible to constrain mẽR up to 344 GeV and mẽL up to 170 GeV in the process e-γ  →  01ẽ-L / R  →  e-0101 from a measurement of the total cross sections. The forward-backward asymmetry AFB gives additional information on these masses. Especially one could measure masses mẽL > 170 GeV if mẽR is high enough. The cross sections and the forward-backward asymmetries allow to test the equations for the selectron masses complementary to an e+e--collider.
