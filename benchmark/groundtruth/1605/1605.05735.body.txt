A generalization of dual symmetry and reciprocity for symmetric algebras

Introduction

Semisimple modules are one of the most well-understood classes of modules. Hence slicing a module into semisimple ones is a natural way to study modules. Loewy structures provide a means of doing so. To establish Loewy structures several studies has been done [\cite=Benson] [\cite=Koshitani] [\cite=Waki]. A primary tool in these studies is the Landrock lemma [\cite=Landrock:J] [\cite=Landrock:B], which is stated below.

Let A be a finite dimensional algebra over a field F and [formula] the F-dual functor. The opposite algebra is denoted by [formula]. The term module refers to a finitely generated right module. Recall that A is a symmetric algebra if [formula] as (A,A)-bimodules. For other notations see Definition [\ref=dfn:soc-rad].

For a finite dimensional symmetric algebra A over a field F, let Pi and Pj be the projective covers of simple A-modules Si and Sj respectively. Then for an integer n  ≥  1 we have an F-linear isomorphism

[formula]

Under the same assumptions and notations of Theorem [\ref=thm:Landrock], we have an F-linear isomorphism

[formula]

Although these results are powerful as indicated in the beginning, they are not applicable to algebras other than finite dimensional symmetric ones. We generalize the above results to arbitrary finite dimensional algebras. To state our main theorem we let [formula] be the A-dual functor and [formula] the Nakayama functor.

For a finite dimensional algebra A over a field F, let Pi and Pj be the projective covers of simple A-modules Si and Sj respectively. Then for an integer n  ≥  1 we have F-linear isomorphisms

[formula]

This paper is organized as follows. In Section [\ref=sec:Proof_of_Main_Theorem] we introduce key tools to prove our main theorem, socle functors and capital functors, and prove Theorem [\ref=thm:main] assuming lemmas. We also derive Theorem [\ref=thm:Landrock] and Corollary [\ref=cor:Landrock] from our main theorem. Section [\ref=sec:Example] deals with a simple example to see how our main theorem looks in a concrete situation. Section [\ref=sec:Proofs_of_Lemmas] consists of proofs of the lemmas in Section [\ref=sec:Proof_of_Main_Theorem].

Proof of Main Theorem

We introduce basic terminology of this paper and state some useful lemmas first. Then a proof of the main theorem is given. The Landrock lemma is proved as a special case of the main theorem.

For a module V over an algebra, [formula] denotes the sum of minimal submodules of V and [formula] denotes the intersection of maximal submodules of V. For an integer n  ≥  0, the nth socle of V is defined inductively by [formula] and

[formula]

if n  >  0. For an integer n  ≥  0, the nth radical of V is also defined inductively by [formula] and

[formula]

if n  >  0. We then write

[formula]

and call it the nth socle layer of V for n  ≥  1. We also write

[formula]

and call it the nth radical layer of V for n  ≥  1.

For an integer n  ≥  0 and a module V over an algebra we write [formula] and call it the nth capital of V. Since any homomorphism maps the nth socle into the nth socle and the nth radical into the nth radical, [formula] and [formula] define endofunctors. We call these endofunctors the nth socle functor and the nth capital functor respectively.

The next simple lemma, which does not appear in the literature to the best of author's knowledge, is vital to prove the main theorem. The category of finitely generated right A-modules is denoted by [formula].

Let A be a finite dimensional algebra over a field. Then for any integer n  ≥  0 the nth capital functor and nth socle functor yield an adjoint pair of functors.

[formula]

For a sense of unity we adopt an alias

[formula]

Note that [formula] and [formula] define endofunctors as [formula] and [formula]. The following lemma can essentially be found in [\cite=Nagao-Tsushima].

Let A be a finite dimensional algebra over a field. For any integer n  ≥  1 we have a natural isomorphism

[formula]

We derive Theorem [\ref=thm:Landrock] and Corollary [\ref=cor:Landrock] from the main theorem in the following. The next characterization of symmetric algebras is well-known [\cite=Rickard].

A finite dimensional algebra over a field is symmetric if and only if [formula].

If a finite dimensional algebra over a field is symmetric then the Nakayama functor is naturally isomorphic to the identity functor.

Example

In this section, Theorem [\ref=thm:main] is illustrated by a simple example, a connected selfinjective Nakayama algebra. Let us describe this algebra and their modules first. See [\cite=Skowronski-Yamagata] for terminology.

Algebra and Modules

Let k and [formula] be natural numbers and F an algebraically closed field. The quiver defined by

[formula]

is denoted by Δk. The ideal of path algebra FΔk over the field F generated by the arrows of Δk is denoted by Rk. Set [formula]. This is a connected selfinjective Nakayama algebra [\cite=Skowronski-Yamagata]. The simple module corresponding to the vertex i is denoted by Si for [formula]. Since [formula] is a Nakayama algebra, the projective cover Pi of Si and the injective envelope Ii of Si are uniserial. The composition series, radical series, and socle series of those modules coincide. Those structures are described by its composition factors as below.

[formula]

The Nakayama functor thus acts as [formula] for [formula].

Reciprocity

The reciprocity [\eqref=eq:reciprocity] is then illustrated by the following.

Dual Symmetry

The radical layers of [formula] is obtained as follows. For [formula] we have

[formula]

The dual symmetry [\eqref=eq:dual_symmetry] is hence illustrated by the following.

[formula]

Proofs of Lemmas

We prove Lemma [\ref=lem:relation] in the following. Let us introduce a lemma to prove the lemma.

Let A be a finite dimensional algebra over a field. For any integer n  ≥  0 we have a natural isomorphism
