Introduction

A cover of a hypergraph is a set of vertices meeting every edge of the hypergraph. The vertex cover number τ(H) of a hypergraph H is the number of vertices in the smallest cover of H. A matching is a set of disjoint edges, and the matching number ν(H) of a hypergraph H is the maximum size of a matching consisting of edges of H. A hypergraph with ν(H) = 1 is called intersecting.

A hypergraph is r-uniform if every edge has r vertices. Any r-uniform hypergraph H satisfies the inequality τ(H)  ≤  rν(H), since the union of the edges of a maximum matching is a cover. This bound is sharp, as shown for ν = 1 by any r-uniform hypergraph consisting of the lines of some projective plane of order r  -  1 (denoted by Pr). To obtain an example for arbitrary ν, one can take the union of disjoint copies of Pr. Sharpness is also attained by other examples, such as the family of all subsets of size r in a ground set of size kr - 1 which has ν = k - 1 and τ = (k - 1)r.

A hypergraph is r-partite if its vertex set V can be partitioned into r sets [formula], called the sides of the hypergraph, so that every edge contains at most one vertex from each side. Ryser [\cite=hend] conjectured that the upper bound τ(H)  ≤  rν(H) can be improved if the hypergraph is r-partite:

For any r-partite r-uniform hypergraph we have

[formula]

When r = 2, Ryser's Conjecture is equivalent to König's Theorem. The only other known general case of the conjecture is r = 3, which was proved by Aharoni [\cite=ahro]. However, the conjecture is also known to be true for some special cases. In particular, it has been proven by Tuza [\cite=tuz_un] for r-partite intersecting hypergraphs when r  ≤  5, and by Franceti, Herke, McKay, and Wanless [\cite=Wanless2] for r  ≤  9, when one makes the further assumption that any two edges of the r-partite hypergraph intersect in exactly one vertex.

Besides trying to prove the conjecture, there has also been considerable effort in understanding which hypergraphs are extremal for Ryser's Conjecture, i.e. finding r-partite hypergraphs H with τ(H) = (r  -  1)ν(H). We call such an object an r-Ryser hypergraph (or, without specifying its uniformity, a Ryser hypergraph). Denoted by Tr, the truncated projective plane of uniformity r is obtained from Pr by the removal of a single vertex v and the lines containing v. The sides [formula] of Tr are the sets of vertices other than v on the lines containing v. It is known and not difficult to see that Tr is intersecting and its cover number is one less than its uniformity r. Except for finitely many sporadic examples, all minimal hypergraphs known to attain Ryser's bound are subhypergraphs of truncated projective planes. Consequently, aside from finitely many exceptions, the set of uniformities r for which Ryser's Conjecture is known to be tight is limited to those integers for which a projective plane of order r  -  1 exists.

Finite projective planes are only known to exist for orders that are prime powers, and it is a long-standing open problem to decide whether there exists a projective plane of any other order. A few non-existence results are known about projective planes, in particular it has been shown that finite projective planes of order 6 and 10 do not exist [\cite=bruck] [\cite=lam]. This implies that the first values of r, for which the truncated projective plane construction of uniformity r does not work are 7 and 11. Inspired by the lack of examples attaining Ryser's bound for these values, Aharoni, Barát and Wanless [\cite=Wanless] constructed 7-partite intersecting hypergraphs with cover number 6. This was also obtained independently by Abu-Khazneh and Pokrovskiy [\cite=AbuKhaznehPokrovskiy], who also constructed an 11-partite intersecting hypergraph with cover number 10. In [\cite=Wanless2] Franceti, Herke, McKay, and Wanless constructed a 13-partite intersecting hypergraph with cover number 12.

Results

Our main goal is to construct intersecting r-Ryser hypergraphs for an infinite sequence of uniformities r such that r  -  1 is not a prime power. We prove the following theorem.

Let T be an r-partite r-uniform intersecting hypergraph, and let S∈T be an edge such that S intersects every other edge in one vertex, τ(T - S) = r  -  1, and the only covers of T - S of size r  -  1 are sides. Then there exists an intersecting (r + 1)-Ryser hypergraph H.

We notice that for r  ≥  4, the truncated projective plane Tr together with an arbitrary hyperedge S∈Tr satisfy the conditions in Theorem [\ref=MainTheorem]. Then, since Tr is known to exist if r  -  1 = q is a prime power, the following is immediate.

For any prime power q, there exists an intersecting (q + 2)-Ryser hypergraph.

As mentioned, Tr is known to exist if and only if r  -  1 = q is a prime power. Using this, one can argue that there are infinitely many values of uniformities for which Corollary [\ref=cor:MainCorollary] gives a hypergraph that is tight for the bound in Ryser's Conjecture, but for which there can be no truncated projective plane construction (see Section [\ref=sec:conclusion]).

The construction that we use to prove Theorem [\ref=MainTheorem] is flexible enough to give not only one, but many non-isomorphic Ryser hypergraphs. This highlights the difficulty of Ryser's Conjecture, since a proof of it would eventually need to deal with all these extremal constructions. Define an intersecting r-Ryser hypergraph to be minimal if the deletion of any edge produces a hypergraph with cover number r - 2. We prove that there are many minimal intersecting r-Ryser hypergraphs.

For any δ > 0, there is an infinite sequence of integers r, for which there are exp (r0.5  -  δ) non-isomorphic minimal intersecting r-Ryser hypergraphs.

The notion of containment-maximal Ryser hypergraphs turns out to be more subtle, since these hypergraphs may be infinite. It is nevertheless possible to give a meaningful definition of the concept, and prove that there are exponentially many maximal intersecting r-Ryser hypergraphs. We postpone the precise statement of the relevant theorem to Section [\ref=sec:maximal].

New extremals from old

In this section, we prove Theorem [\ref=MainTheorem]. We define an {r  -  1,r}-uniform hypergraph to be a family of sets of size r  -  1 and r. Notice that in order to find an r-uniform hypergraph H with τ(H) = r  -  1, it suffices to find an {r  -  1,r}-uniform H' with τ(H') = r  -  1. Once we have such a hypergraph, we can construct an r-uniform hypergraph from H' by adding a separate new vertex to each edge of size r  -  1.

Let T be an r-partite r-uniform intersecting hypergraph with sides [formula]. Let [formula] be an edge of T, with si∈Vi, that satisfies the conditions in Theorem [\ref=MainTheorem]. Let [formula] be r edges of T with [formula] for each i, and also [formula] for all i,j. The edges [formula] do not have to be distinct -- one possibility is to take [formula].

We define an {r,r  +  1}-uniform, intersecting hypergraph [formula], which has cover number r.

The vertex set of [formula] consists of the vertex set of T together with r vertices [formula] in side Vr + 1.

For an edge E  ≠  S of T satisfying [formula], we define Ê  =  E + vi. That is, Ê is an (r + 1)-edge built from E by adding the vertex vi corresponding to the vertex of S which E contains. Notice that Ê is well-defined since S intersects any other edge of T in exactly one vertex.

Define

[formula]

We let [formula].

In other words [formula] has three parts: The first part consists of taking the (r + 1)-edges Ê for all E∈T other than S. The second part consists of the r-edges Fi. The third part consists of the r-edges created from [formula] by deleting the vertex at which they intersect S, and adding the corresponding vertex vi.

First we show that these hypergraphs are intersecting.

[formula] is intersecting.

The hypergraph induced by [formula] is intersecting since its restriction to the first r sides gives T - S, which is an intersecting hypergraph. Furthermore for any i and j, we have [formula] by assumption. Therefore the hypergraph induced by [formula] is intersecting.

It remains to show that edges in E1 intersect those in E3. That is, [formula] for any E  ≠  S and [formula]. Since T is intersecting, there is some vertex [formula]. If x  ≠  si, then [formula]. Otherwise [formula].

We show that the covers of the hypergraph [formula] have a very specific structure.

If C is a cover of [formula], then [formula] is a cover of T - S.

Let E be an arbitrary edge of T - S. We show that [formula] We know that [formula], since C is a cover of [formula]. Let y be a vertex in [formula]. If [formula], then y∈C' which implies [formula]. Otherwise y  =  vi for some i, which implies that [formula].

We now prove that [formula] has cover number r. This immediately implies Theorem [\ref=MainTheorem] (by taking H to be [formula] with a new vertex added to each of its r-edges).

The hypergraph [formula] is an (r + 1)-partite, {r,r + 1}-uniform, intersecting hypergraph with [formula].

It is immediate that [formula] is (r + 1)-partite and {r,r + 1}-uniform -- the r-edges E∈T - S just gained a vertex vi in Vr + 1 in order to become Ê, whereas the r-edges Fi had vertex si deleted in Vi, and vi added in Vr + 1. From Lemma [\ref=LemmaIntersecting], [formula] is intersecting.

It remains to prove that [formula] has cover number r. Suppose to the contrary that there is a cover C of [formula] with |C|  ≤  r  -  1. Now C' is a cover of T - S by Lemma [\ref=CoverMirror], and |C'|  ≤  |C|  ≤  r  -  1. By the assumption of Theorem [\ref=MainTheorem], the cover C' must be one of the sides Vi for some [formula]. Now the definition of C' implies that the cover C is either Vi or Vi - si + vi. In the first case, C does not cover the edge Fi - si + vi, while in the second case, C does not cover the edge Fi, both contradicting the assumption that C is a cover of [formula].

Many minimal examples

The goal of this section is to prove Theorem [\ref=counting]. Using the notation of Section [\ref=sec:newextremals], let [formula] be the hypergraph with edge set [formula]. First we prove a lemma which implies that it is sufficient to find many non-isomorphic hypergraphs [formula].

Let [formula] be edges of the truncated projective plane [formula] with [formula]. If there is a subhypergraph HF of [formula] with cover number τ(HF) = r which is isomorphic to a subhypergraph HG of [formula] with cover number τ(HG)  =  r, then [formula] is isomorphic to [formula].

We claim that [formula] is contained in HF. Indeed, if an edge Fi - si + vi was missing from HF, then the side Vi would be a cover of size r  -  1. Similarly, if Fi was missing, then Vi  -  si + vi would be a cover of size r  -  1. By the same argument, [formula] is contained in HG.

Let φ be an isomorphism from HF to HG. We claim that φ induces an isomorphism from [formula] to [formula]. Indeed, notice that in our construction the possible intersection sizes of edges in [formula] are 1,2,r  -  1, and r (since we are assuming r  ≥  4). There are only r pairs of hyperedges that have intersection of size r  -  1: the pairs Fi and Fi  -  si + vi. This implies that any isomorphism must map a pair of sets Fi and Fi - si + vi into some pair Gj,Gj - sj + vj (in some order), consequently the restriction of φ onto the vertex set of [formula] is an isomorphism between this hypergraph and [formula].

We will combine Lemma [\ref=Sisomorphism] with the following.

For any δ  >  0 and large enough integer r of the form q + 1, where q is a prime power, there are at least r0.5 - δ non-isomorphic hypergraphs [formula] for the different choices of edges [formula].

We give a lower bound on the number of non-isomorphic hypergraphs [formula] by showing that there are at least rΩ(r0.5 - δ) distinct degree sequences which can occur in such hypergraphs.

Let us choose t = ⌊r0.5 - δ⌋ positive integers [formula] such that t + 2  <  xi  ≤  r0.5 for all [formula] and let [formula]. We select appropriate edges [formula] of [formula] for our construction such that the degree sequence of the non-isolated vertices of V1 in [formula] is [formula]. This is possible since we can partition [formula] into t + 1 sets [formula] such that |Si|  =  xi, and as Fj, we select the line connecting sj to the ith vertex wi of [formula], where j∈Si. (Recall that for any two vertices in different sides of [formula] there is exactly one line passing through both of them.) We choose F1  ≠  S to be an arbitrary line passing through s1. Now the vertex degrees in V1 are as promised.

We observe that all degrees of [formula] are at most 2t + 4 in the other sides, since there are exactly t + 2 vertices with non-zero degree in the first side (and no pair of vertices is contained in two lines of [formula]). Therefore, the multiset of degrees of the hypergraph [formula] consists of [formula] and some multiset with elements from [formula]. Using the fact that each xi is more than t + 2, we obtain that each multiset [formula] with elements from [formula] corresponds to a different [formula].

The number of ways to choose the appropriate multiset is at least [formula].

We can now prove Theorem [\ref=counting].

For every large enough (compared to 1 / δ) prime power q = r - 2, there are at least [formula] different (q + 2)-uniform hypergraphs of the form [formula] by Lemma [\ref=CountingS]. Each of these hypergraphs is contained in the corresponding r-Ryser hypergraph [formula]. Each [formula] contains some minimal r-Ryser hypergraph [formula]. These r0.5 - δ minimal extremal hypergraphs [formula] are all non-isomorphic by Lemma [\ref=Sisomorphism], since otherwise we would obtain an isomorphism between some of the corresponding non-isomorphic hypergraphs of the form [formula].

Many maximal examples and the Ryser poset

Theorem [\ref=counting] proves that there are many minimal Ryser hypergraphs. We use the following lemma to show that there are also many non-isomorphic maximal intersecting Ryser hypergraphs. The lemma states that the hypergraphs [formula] are essentially maximal. We mean this in the sense that there are only "trivial" ways to add edges to them: any new edge must be a "twin copy" of some [formula], differing in one vertex only, either in side i or side r + 1.

Again, we use the truncated projective plane  for our construction in Theorem [\ref=MainTheorem]. Let us fix an arbitrary line [formula], and an appropriate selection of lines Fi  ≠  S with si∈Fi.

For r  ≥  5, let G be an intersecting (r  +  1)-partite hypergraph containing [formula] and [formula]. Then |E| = r + 1 and there is some i  ≤  r and vertex v such that either E = Fi + v (of type 1) or E = Fi - si + vi + v (of type 2).

Suppose the statement is false. Let G and E∈G provide a counterexample such that [formula] is as large as possible amongst all counterexamples.

[formula].

We know that τ(H) = r and G  ⊇  H is intersecting. Therefore, [formula] must be a cover of H.

First suppose that |E|  <  r + 1. Then E must be of size r and fully contained in V(H). Let Vj be the side in which E has no vertex. We will show that we can add a vertex of Vj to E such that we do not create an edge of type 1 or 2. Let i be an index such that [formula] is as large as possible. Let x be a vertex in [formula] which is not in Fi + vi. We will show that E + x is not of type 1 or 2. If [formula], then [formula] for all k, which implies E + x is not of type 1 or 2. If [formula], then since r  ≥  5, we have that [formula] for all k  ≠  i. As before, this implies that [formula] for all k  ≠  i, and so the only way E + x could be of type 1 or 2 is if E + x = Fi + x or E + x = Fi - si + vi + x. However, in either case we would obtain that E∈H contradicting the assumption of the lemma. Therefore, replacing E by E + x increases the size of the intersection [formula], contradicting its maximality.

From now on we assume that |E| = r + 1.

Suppose now that there is an index i such that [formula] and let [formula]. Since r  ≥  5, there must be at least 4 vertices [formula]. Let Ei = E - x + xi for [formula] to get four sets, each having one more vertex in V(H) than E has. We show that one of these edges Ei is neither in H nor has type 1 or 2. For such an edge, [formula] is an intersecting hypergraph and for Ei∈G' we have [formula] contradicting the maximality condition of the definition of E.

We check the required property of the Ei-s. Notice that the maximum intersection size between a pair of (r + 1)-edges of H is 2. Therefore, at most one of the edges [formula] is in H. Further, if for distinct j and k we had Ej = Fa + ya and Ek = Fb + yb for some [formula] and vertices ya and yb, then we would have [formula]. Since [formula] for distinct a and b, [formula] implies that Fa = Fb and hence E = Fa + x, contradicting our assumption that E is not of type 1. Similarly, if for distinct j and k we had Ej = Fa - sa + va + ya and Ek = Fb - sb + vb + yb, then we would have [formula]. Since [formula] for distinct a and b, [formula] implies that Fa = Fb and hence E = Fa - sa + va + x, contradicting our assumption that E is not of type 2. In summary, at most three of the edges [formula] do not satisfy the required property and hence one of them does provide the contradiction in the end of the previous paragraph.

Let vi be the vertex in [formula] and B = E - vi + si. The set B intersects every edge of [formula] as well as each of the sides [formula], i.e. B is a blocking set of Pr. Since B has size at most q + 2 = r + 1, it must contain a full line L of Pr.

Let pi be the vertex in [formula]. Notice that B has only one vertex in each side, with the exception of Vi, where B contains both si and pi (although it is possible that si = pi). Since B contains the line L we have either B = L + si or B = L + pi. From the definition of B, we obtain that E = L + vi or E = L - si + pi + vi holds.

Suppose that E = L + vi. If L = Fj for some j, then E is of type 1, and we are done. Otherwise let sj be [formula]. If j = i, then [formula], contradicting our assumption that E is not from [formula]. If j  ≠  i, then L is disjoint from the edge Fj - sj + vj∈H, contradicting G being intersecting.

Suppose that E = L - si + vi + pi. Since we are not in the previous case, we can assume that si  ≠  pi. If L = Fi, then E is of type 2, and we are done. Otherwise [formula] since [formula] and vi∉Fi, contradicting G being intersecting.

The Ryser poset

Extremal r-uniform hypergraphs for Ryser's Conjecture possess two properties for some integer ν: they have matching number at most ν and vertex cover number at least (r  -  1)ν. The first of these is a monotone decreasing property, while the second is monotone increasing. This suggests the definition of a poset structure on the family of extremal r-graphs. While a similar poset can be defined for arbitrary matching number ν, here we restrict ourselves for the intersecting case, as that is already complicated enough. The r-Ryser poset Rr contains all intersecting r-Ryser hypergraphs (up to isomorphism), that is, all r-partite, r-uniform hypergraphs which are intersecting and have vertex cover number r  -  1. The poset relation <   is given by the sub-hypergraph relation.

The 2-Ryser poset R2 is an infinite chain of stars with K2 as its minimal element. The poset R3 was determined in [\cite=HNS] (for arbitrary matching numbers). In the intersecting case, R3 has a unique minimal element: the 3-graph R obtained from [formula] by deleting one of its edges. Above R in the poset there is of course [formula], but as well the direct product of three infinite chains with R as their common minimal element. This is because one could add to R an arbitrary number of twin copies of each of its three degree-one vertices, without losing its extremality for the 3-uniform Ryser Conjecture.

To characterize r-Ryser hypergraphs, it is necessary to have a full understanding of the minimal and maximal elements of the Ryser poset. What a minimal element in some Ryser poset should be is quite clear: an r-Ryser hypergraph with the property that the deletion of any hyperedge reduces the vertex cover number. These were discussed in Section [\ref=sec:manyextremals]. Naturally, one would want to define the maximal elements of the Ryser poset as the hypergraphs with the property that the addition of any new hyperedge increases the matching number. With this definition however we would not have the very much desirable property that an intersecting r-Ryser hypergraph is always contained in a maximal one. Indeed, as we saw it above it is sometimes possible to add infinitely many "twin copies" of an edge to an r-Ryser hypergraph without ever reaching a maximal element.

This issue can be resolved by allowing countably infinite r-Ryser hypergraphs into the poset. When considering infinite hypergraphs however, a technical issue arises, since it is possible to have two non-isomorphic hypergraphs which are both subgraphs of each other. To circumvent this, we consider an equivalence relation ~   on all r-uniform countable hypergraphs where H  ~  H' if H is contained in H' and also H' is contained in H. Then equivalence classes of intersecting extremal hypergraphs form a poset under containment. Note that using the Sunflower Lemma it is not difficult to see that the Ryser poset has finitely many maximal elements. Combining Lemmas [\ref=CountingS] and [\ref=LemmaMaximal] we obtain the following.

For any δ  >  0, there is an infinite sequence of integers r, for which there are Ω( exp (r0.5  -  δ)) non-isomorphic maximal elements in the r-Ryser poset.

The maximal elements in Corollary [\ref=TheoremCountingMaximal] come from the hypergraphs [formula], adding infinitely many vertices to each partition, and then adding all the (infinitely many) copies of edges of the forms Fi + v, v∈Vr + 1, and Fi - si + vi + v, v∈Vi, for every [formula]. From Lemma [\ref=LemmaMaximal] we have that the resulting infinite hypergraphs are maximal since the only edges which can be added to them must be of the form Fi + v and Fi - si + vi + v, where v is a new vertex.

Concluding remarks

1. No truncated projective planes.

While it is only conjectured that projective planes, and hence truncated projective planes, do not exist for orders other than prime powers, one can show that for infinitely many of the uniformities r = p + 2 our constructions deals with, a truncated projective plane cannot exist. For this let us first note that there are infinitely many primes p of the form 8k + 5 by Dirichlet's Theorem. For such primes, by a well-known consequence of Fermat's Theorem on sums of two squares, p + 1  =  2(4k + 3) is not the sum two squares since its prime factorization must have a prime factor of the form 4m  +  3 with an odd exponent. Moreover p + 1 is congruent to 2 modulo 4, so by the Bruck-Ryser Theorem there exists no projective plane of order p + 1. Hence our constructions of uniformity p + 2 provide extremal hypergraphs, where truncated projective planes do not exist.

2. The Ryser poset.

Theorem [\ref=counting] and Corollary [\ref=TheoremCountingMaximal] show that the Ryser poset (containing all the intersecting r-Ryser hypergraphs) has many non-isomorphic maximal and minimal elements, giving further support for the difficulty of Ryser's Conjecture. A better understanding of the Ryser poset seems essential to approach Ryser's Conjecture in general. With Theorem [\ref=counting] and Corollary [\ref=TheoremCountingMaximal] we made the first steps in this direction. There are several other natural extremal problems that arise.

What is the smallest and largest number of edges in a minimal intersecting extremal r-Ryser hypergraph?

For the number of edges in a maximal r-Ryser hypergraph truncated projective planes and our construction provide examples with Θ(r2) edges.

It was observed in [\cite=Wanless] that if a projective plane of order r - 1 exists then one can construct quite sparse intersecting Ryser hypergraphs randomly. Kahn [\cite=kahn] proved that with high probability a randomly chosen 22r log r lines of [formula] cannot be covered with less than r points. This construction immediately implies a O(r log r) upper bond on the minimal size of an intersecting extremal r-Ryser hypergraph. It is an outstanding question of Mansour, Song, and Yuster [\cite=mans] whether there exists one with O(r) edges.

It would also be interesting to decide whether there exists maximal intersecting extremal r-Ryser hypergraphs with sub-quadratic number of edges.

The 2-Ryser poset R2 and the 3-Ryser poset R3 is well understood [\cite=HNS]. The first open case seems quite interesting.

Describe R4!

3. Asymptotic Ryser.

Since there is still no construction of r-partite r-uniform hypergraphs with τ(H) = r  -  1 for all r, it would be interesting to investigate hypergraphs with cover number close to r  -  1. Notice that from it is possible to construct for every r an r-partite intersecting hypergraph with τ(H) = r - o(r) by adding s  =  o(r) new vertices to each edge in [formula]. (The necessary prime r - s - 2 exists by the known estimates on gaps between consecutive primes.)

Any family of graphs satisfying τ(H) = r - o(r), which is different from the projective plane construction would already be interesting. We set the following problem to motivate further research.

For some fixed constant c and every r construct an r-uniform r-partite intersecting hypergraph with τ(H) = r - c.

4. Non-intersecting Ryser.

We constructed intersecting extremal hypergraphs for Ryser's Conjecture. It is easy to construct extremal hypergraphs with matching number equal to ν simply by taking ν vertex-disjoint copies of an intersecting extremal hypergraph. A natural question is whether all extremal hypergraphs for Ryser's Conjecture can be built in a similar fashion out of intersecting ones. For r = 3 we know that the answer is "yes" -- Haxell, Narins, and Szabó [\cite=HNS] showed that for any 3-partite hypergraph with H with τ(H) = 2ν(H) contains ν(H) vertex-disjoint intersecting hypergraphs with cover number 2. It would be interesting to know if this generalizes to higher uniformities.

For r  ≥  4, are there r-uniform, r-partite hypergraphs with τ(H) = (r  -  1)ν(H), which do not contain ν(H) vertex-disjoint, intersecting, r-uniform hypergraphs with cover number r  -  1?
