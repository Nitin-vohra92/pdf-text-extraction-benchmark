On the Approximation of Laplacian Eigenvalues in Graph Disaggregation

Introduction

A variety of real-world graphs, including web networks [\cite=MR2091634], social networks [\cite=MR2282139], and bioinformatics networks [\cite=Ji04agraph], exhibit a degree power law. Namely, the fraction of nodes of degree k, denoted by P(k), follows a power distribution of the form P(k)  ~  k-  γ, where γ is typically in the range 2 < γ < 3. Networks of this variety are often referred to as scale-free networks. The pairing of a few high-degree vertices with many low-degree vertices on large scale-free networks makes computations such as Laplacian matrix-vector products and solving linear and eigenvalue equations challenging. The computation of the minimal nontrivial eigenpair can become prohibitively expensive. This eigenpair has many important applications, such as diffusion mapping and graph partitioning [\cite=CPE:CPE4330060203] [\cite=Nadler05diffusionmaps] [\cite=urschel2015cascadic] [\cite=urschel2014spectral].

Breaking the few high degree nodes into multiple smaller degree nodes is a way to address this issue, especially when large-scale parallel computers are available. This technique, called graph disaggregation, was introduced by Kuhlemann and Vassilevski [\cite=Kuhlemann.V;Vassilevski.P2013a] [\cite=d2015compatible]. In this process, each of the high-degree vertices of the network is replaced by a graph, such as a cycle or a clique, where each incident edge of the original node now connects to a node of the cycle or clique (see Figure [\ref=fig:dis]).

Independently, Lee, Peng, and Spielman investigated the concept of graph disaggregation, referred to as vertex splitting, in the setting of combinatorial spectral sparsifiers  [\cite=lee2015sparsified]. They proved results for graphs disaggregated from complete graphs and expanders, and used the Schur complement of the disaggregated Laplacian with respect to the disaggregated vertices to approximate the original Laplacian. The basic motivating assumption in such constructions is that the spectral structure of the graph Laplacian induced by the disaggregated graph approximates the spectral structure of the original graph well.

In [\cite=Kuhlemann.V;Vassilevski.P2013a] [\cite=d2015compatible] Kuhlemann and Vassilevski took a numerical approach. We extend, expand upon, and prove precise and rigorous theoretical results regarding this technique. First, we look at the case of a single disaggregated vertex and establish bounds on the error in spectral approximation with respect to the Laplacians of the original and disaggregated graph, as well as results related to the Cheeger constant. We investigate a conjecture made in [\cite=Kuhlemann.V;Vassilevski.P2013a] and give strong theoretical evidence that it does not hold in general. Then, we treat the more general case of disaggregation of multiple vertices and prove analogous results. Finally, we construct an alternative disaggregation operator whose eigenvalues interlace with those of the original graph Laplacian, and, hence, provide excellent approximation to the spectrum of the latter. We then use this new disaggregation operator to construct a uniform preconditioner for the graph Laplacian of the original graph. We prove that the preconditioned graph Laplacian can be made arbitrarily close to the identity operator if we require that the weights of the internal disaggregated edges are sufficiently large.

Single Vertex Disaggregation

Consider a weighted, connected, undirected graph [formula], |V|  =  n. Let e  =  (i,j) denote an edge that connects vertices i and j, and 〈  ·  ,  ·  〉 and [formula] denote the standard [formula]-inner product and the corresponding induced norm. The associated weighted graph Laplacian [formula] is given by

[formula]

where we denote the (i,j)-th element of A by aij. Without loss of generality, let us disaggregate the last vertex [formula] of the graph [formula]. Then, the Laplacian can be written in the following block form

[formula]

where ann is the degree of [formula]. Here, we assume that the graph is simply connected and the associated Laplacian A has eigenvalues

[formula]

and corresponding eigenvectors

[formula]

The eigenpair [formula] has special significance, and therefore λ2(A) is referred to as the algebraic connectivity, denoted [formula], and [formula] is referred to as the Fiedler vector.

We can also write a given nontrivial eigenpair [formula], λ(A)  ≠  0, [formula], in block notation, namely

[formula]

We have the relations

[formula]

where n0  =  n - 1. Suppose that the vertex [formula] is disaggregated into d vertices, with an unspecified connected structure between the disaggregated elements. We will denote this graph by [formula]. This induces a disaggregated graph Laplacian [formula], N  =  n0  +  d, with eigenvalues [formula] and corresponding eigenvectors [formula]. We can write AD in block form

[formula]

We have the relations

[formula]

Let us introduce the prolongation operator [formula],

[formula]

The following result is immediate.

Let A and AD be the graph Laplacian of the original graph [formula] and the disaggregated and simply connected graph [formula], respectively. If P is defined as [\eqref=def:P], then we have

[formula]

We aim to show that the algebraic connectivity of AD is bounded away from the algebraic connectivity of the original graph A. To do so, suppose we have an eigenpair [formula] of the Laplacian of the original graph [formula]. We prolongate the eigenvector [formula] to the disaggregated graph [formula] and obtain an approximate eigenvector by the procedure

[formula]

This gives [formula].

We consider [formula] to be an approximation of [formula] on the non-trivial eigenspace of the disaggregated operator AD. We have the following relation between the eigenvalue λ of A and the Rayleigh quotient of [formula] with respect to AD.

Let [formula], [formula], be an eigenpair of the graph Laplacian A associated with a simply connected graph [formula], and [formula] be defined by [\eqref=def:hat-varphi]. We have

[formula]

We have

[formula]

and

[formula]

This completes the proof.

The following result quickly follows by applying Lemma [\ref=lem:rq-relation] to the Fielder vector.

Let [formula], [formula], be the Fiedler vector of the graph Laplacian A associated with a simply connected graph [formula]. Let AD be the graph Laplacian corresponding to the disaggregated and simply connected graph [formula] resulting from disaggregating one vertex into d > 1 vertices. We have

[formula]

Noting that [formula] is orthogonal to [formula], we have

[formula]

which completes the proof.

If the characteristic value of the disaggregated vertex is non-zero, then the algebraic connectivity of the disaggregated graph stays bounded away from that of the original graph, independent of the structure of An. Therefore, as the weight on the internal edges approaches infinity, the approximation stays bounded away.

In [\cite=Kuhlemann.V;Vassilevski.P2013a], the authors made the following conjecture.

Under certain conditions the Laplacian eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian of the disaggregated graph approximate the eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian of the original graph, provided that the weight on the internal edges of the disaggregation is chosen to be large enough.

Theorem [\ref=thm:algebraic-connectivity] directly implies that Conjecture [\ref=wrongconject] is false when the characteristic value of the disaggregated vertex is non-zero, which, for a random power law graph, occurs with probability one.

We also have the following result, providing an estimate of how close the approximation [formula] is to the invariant subspace with respect to AD.

Let A and AD be the original graph and disaggregated graph, [formula] be an eigenpair of the graph Laplacian A associated with a simply connected graph [formula], and [formula] be defined by [\eqref=def:hat-varphi]. We have

[formula]

We recall that

[formula]

and

[formula]

We also have

[formula]

giving

[formula]

In many applications, we are only concerned with minimal Laplacian eigenpairs. For minimal eigenvalues of scale-free graphs, we have λ  =  O(1) and φn  =  O(N- 1 / 2). In this way, often the largest source of error comes from the term [formula]. Heuristically, the error of this term is typically best controlled when d is relatively small and each new disaggregate is connected to roughly the same number of exterior vertices.

Next, we consider the eigenvalues of the normalized Laplacian. This gives us insight into how the Cheeger constant changes after disaggregating a vertex. Again, suppose we have an eigenpair [formula] of the normalized graph Laplacian D- 1A, where D is the degree matrix of [formula], namely [formula]. Again, we prolongate the eigenvector [formula] and obtain an approximate eigenvector of the disaggregated normalized graph Laplacian D- 1DAD, where DD is the degree matrix of [formula], in a similar fashion

[formula]

We may write DD in the following way

[formula]

where [formula] are the weights of the edges incident with vertex [formula] on the original graph (note [formula]) and dexi  =  aDi,i  -  ωi, [formula]. We may also rewrite the shift s as

[formula]

Let [formula] denote the total weights of a graph [formula], and let [formula] be the disaggregated local subgraph. Similarly, we consider [formula] as an approximation of the eigenvectors of the disaggregated normalized graph Laplacian. We have the following lemma.

Let [formula] be an eigenpair of the normalized graph Laplacian associated with a simply connected graph [formula] and [formula] be defined by [\eqref=def:phi]. We have

[formula]

and

[formula]

We have

[formula]

and

[formula]

Noting that [formula], [formula], and [formula], we obtain [\eqref=eqn:RQ_normalized]. Moreover, [\eqref=ine:nu_2] follows directly from [\eqref=eqn:RQ_normalized].

The Cheeger constant of a weighted graph is defined as follows [\cite=Friedland.S;Nabben.R2002a] [\cite=Chung.F1997a] where Due to the Cheeger inequality [\cite=Friedland.S;Nabben.R2002a] [\cite=Chung.F1997a], the Cheeger constant [formula] and ν2 are related as follows

[formula]

For the Cheeger constant of the original graph [formula] and the disaggregated and simply connected graph [formula], we have where α is defined by [\eqref=ine:nu_2]. If [formula], then [formula].

Based on [\eqref=ine:cheeger] and [\eqref=ine:nu_2], we have

[formula]

Basic algebra shows that [formula] if [formula].

Graph Disaggregation

We now move on to the more general case of multiple disaggregated vertices. Without loss of generality, for a graph Laplacian [formula], suppose we are disaggregating the first m vertices. This gives us the disaggregated Laplacian [formula]. Here, N is the number of vertices in the disaggregated graph, given by

[formula]

Note that we have m groups of vertices associated with the disaggregation, which we can also number consecutively

[formula]

Similar to the case of a single disaggregated vertex, we can establish a relationship between A and AD through a prolongation matrix [formula], given by

[formula]

Here, [formula], and

[formula]

Note that [formula]. We have the following lemma, which can be easily verified by simple algebraic calculation.

Let A and AD be the graph Laplacian of the original graph [formula] and the disaggregated and simply connected graph [formula], respectively. If P is defined as [\eqref=def:Prolongation], then we have

[formula]

If we look at the disaggregated graph Laplacian AD directly, we can obtain a similar bound on the algebraic connectivity as shown in Theorem [\ref=thm:algebraic-connectivity]. Let [formula] be an eigenpair of A. We can define an approximated eigenvector of AD by prolongating [formula] as follows

[formula]

It is easy to check that [formula]. Now we have the following lemma about the Rayleigh quotient of [formula] with respect to AD.

Let [formula] be an eigenpair of the graph Laplacian A associated with a simply connected graph [formula] and [formula] be defined by [\eqref=def:hat-varphi-multi]. We have

[formula]

Moreover, if for dmaxi  =   max idi, we have n  +  nd  -  mdmaxi  >  0, then [formula]

We note that

[formula]

Denoting [formula] by [formula], we have

[formula]

This completes the proof.

From the Rayleigh quotient and applying the above lemma to the Fielder vector, we have the following theorem concerning the algebraic connectivity.

Let [formula] be the Fiedler vector of the graph Laplacian A associated with a simply connected graph [formula] and AD be the graph Laplacian corresponding to the disaggregated and simply connected graph [formula]. Suppose we have disaggregated m vertices and each of those vertices are disaggregated into di > 1 vertices, [formula]. We have

[formula]

The proof is similar to the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:algebraic-connectivity] and uses Lemma [\ref=lem:rq-relation-multi].

It is possible to perform a more careful estimate, using the fact that disaggregating m vertices at once is equivalent to disaggregating m vertices one by one. Denote n0  =  n and ni  =  ni - 1  -  1  +  di, [formula]. Note that [formula], [formula] and N  =  nm. Recursively applying Theorem [\ref=thm:algebraic-connectivity], we have the following result.

Let [formula] be the Fiedler vector of the graph Laplacian A associated with a simply connected graph [formula] and AD be the graph Laplacian corresponding to the disaggregated and simply connected graph [formula], respectively. Suppose we disaggregated m vertices and each of those are disaggregated into di > 1 vertices, [formula]. We have

[formula]

Let [formula] be the resulting graph after disaggregating the i-th vertex in the graph [formula] and note that [formula]. We have The result follows immediately from applying Theorem [\ref=thm:algebraic-connectivity] on each pair of graphs [formula] and [formula].

A direct consequence of Theorem [\ref=thm:algebraic-connectivity-multi-1] is [formula].

Similarly, we also have the following result concerning the minimal eigenvalue of the normalized graph Laplacian after disaggregating several vertices. Denote [formula], and denote the graph after disaggregating vertex i by [formula]. Note that [formula]. The local subgraph corresponding to disaggregating vertex i is denoted by [formula].

Let ν2 be the second smallest eigenvalue of the normalized graph Laplacian associated with a simply connected graph [formula] and νD2 be the second smallest eigenvalue of the normalized graph Laplacian corresponding to the disaggregated and simply connected graph [formula]. Suppose we disaggregated m vertices and each of them are disaggregated into di > 1 vertices, [formula]. We have Consequently, we have νD2  =  αν2, where

[formula]

The result follows by applying Theorem [\ref=thm:eigenvalue_normalized] recursively.

Based on the estimates on the eigenvalues of normalized graph Laplacian, we can estimate the Cheeger constants as follows.

For the Cheeger constant of the original graph [formula] and the disaggregated and simply connected graph [formula], we have where α is defined by [\eqref=def:alpha]. If [formula], then [formula].

The proof is the same as the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:Cheeger_constant].

Preconditioning Using Disaggregated Graph

We aim to show eigenvalue interlacing between A and a new operator, which is obtained by scaling AD appropriately.

We can rescale P by introducing [formula], where

[formula]

is a diagonal scaling matrix, giving us [formula]. Based on the scaled prolongation, we are able to show the eigenvalues of diagonal scaled matrix

[formula]

interlaces with A. First, let us recall the interlacing theorem.

Let [formula] be such that STS  =  In  ×  n, n  <  N and let [formula] be symmetric, with eigenvalues λ1  ≤  λ2  ≤  ...  ≤  λn. Define A  =  STBS and let A have eigenvalues μ1  ≤  μ2  ≤  ...  ≤  μm. Then λi  ≤  μi  ≤  λn - m + i.

From here, we have the following.

Let A have eigenvalues λ1(A)  ≤  λ2(A)  ≤  ...  ≤  λn(A) and [formula] have eigenvalues [formula]. Then

[formula]

From the above Lemma, we have

[formula]

As [formula], by the Interlacing Theorem [\ref=thm:interlacing], the eigenvalues of A and [formula] interlace.

We now discuss how to use the disaggregated graph [formula] to solve the graph Laplacian on the original graph [formula]. Here, we will use [formula] as the auxiliary problem and design a preconditioner based on the Fictitious Space Lemma [\cite=Nepomnyaschikh.S1992] and auxiliary space framework [\cite=Xu.J1996]. Because A and [formula] are both symmetric positive semi-definite, we first state the refined version of the Fictitious Space Lemma proposed in [\cite=Dios.B;Brezzi.F;Marini.L;Xu.J;Zikatanov.L2014a].

Let [formula] and V be two Hilbert spaces and [formula] be a surjective map. Suppose that [formula] and A:V  ↦  V' are symmetric semi-definite operators. Moreover, suppose

[formula]

then for any symmetric positive definite operator [formula], we have that for [formula],

Applying the above theory to our disaggregation framework, we take A  =  A, [formula], and [formula]. Noting that the null space of [formula] is spanned by [formula], we have

[formula]

which verifies [\eqref=eqn:null-space]. Naturally, [formula] is surjective. Using a preconditioner [formula] of [formula], we can define a preconditioner for A. We give the following results concerning the quality of the preconditioner B.

Let A be the graph Laplacian corresponding to the graph [formula] and AD be the graph Laplacian corresponding to the disaggregated and simply connected graph [formula]. Let Ds be defined by [\eqref=def:D_s] and [formula] be defined by [\eqref=def:tildeA_D]. If

[formula]

and for any [formula], there exist a [formula] such that [formula] and

[formula]

Then for the preconditioner [formula], we have

We need to verify that conditions [\eqref=ine:upper-c1] and [\eqref=ine:lower-c0] hold for [formula]. For condition [\eqref=ine:lower-c0], we choose [formula] for any [formula], giving [formula] since [formula]. Note that

[formula]

which implies condition [\eqref=ine:lower-c0] holds with c0  =  1.

To show that condition [\eqref=ine:upper-c1] holds, we use the following result.

Let [formula] be a graph Laplacian corresponding to a connected graph with n vertices. For all [formula] and [formula] we have where [formula].

First, we note that for all [formula] the matrices Ai are invertible, because they all are irreducibly diagonally dominant M-matrices. We refer to Varga [\cite=2000VargaR-aa] for this classical result.

Next, observe that [formula], and hence, [formula]. Therefore, we have that

[formula]

As [formula], this completes the proof.

The result shown in Lemma [\ref=taylor] is also found in [\cite=Brannick.J;Chen.Y;Kraus.J;Zikatanov.L.2013a], but is included for completeness.

We now apply Lemma [\ref=taylor] to each disaggregated local subgraph [formula], [formula], with [formula], the restriction of [formula] on [formula]. For j∈Vka, we have,

[formula]

where Lk is the unweighted graph Laplacian of the local graph [formula] and Lk,j is defined in accordance with Lemma [\ref=taylor]: [formula], for j∈Vka. Setting [formula], j∈Vka, and denoting

[formula]

we are ready to present the following lemma related to the condition [\eqref=ine:upper-c1].

For each disaggregated local subgraph [formula], if, for an edge e'  =  (p,q)∈Eka, we assign a weight ωe' such that

[formula]

then we have

[formula]

where ε  >  0.

We denote [formula], and we have,

[formula]

Here, we have set [formula],

[formula]

and

[formula]

Next, we estimate I1 and I2 on the right-hand side. For e = (i,j)∈E1D, i∈V0 and j∈Vka, using [\eqref=eqn:taylor-dis-k], we have

[formula]

Then

[formula]

Next, using [\eqref=eqn:taylor-dis-k], for e  =  (i,j)∈E2D, i∈Vka and [formula] we have

[formula]

Then

[formula]

Therefore, we have

[formula]

Hence,

[formula]

Now, we use the definition of We' [\eqref=def:weight] and the estimates on I1 and I2 to obtain that

[formula]

Due to [\eqref=def:weight], we have that ωe'  ≥  We' and [\eqref=ine:upper-epsilon] follows. This completes the proof.

Lemma [\ref=lem:upper-c1] shows that the constant c1 can be made arbitrarily close to 1 if the weights on the internal edges of the disaggregation are chosen to be large enough. As an immediate consequence, we have the following theorem for the preconditioner B.

Under the assumptions of Corollary [\ref=coro:prec-B] and Lemma [\ref=lem:upper-c1], for the preconditioner [formula], we have

[formula]

The relation [\eqref=ine:prec-B-cond] follows from Corollary [\ref=coro:prec-B] since c0  =  1 in [\eqref=eqn:lower-c0] and c1  =  (1 + ε)1 / 2 in Lemma [\ref=lem:upper-c1].

Finally, since [formula], if we have a preconditioner BD for AD and define [formula], then it is easy to verify that [formula]. We have the following theorem showing that the preconditioned operator BA has a condition number comparable to the condition number of BDAD.

Under the assumptions of Corollary [\ref=coro:prec-B] and Lemma [\ref=lem:upper-c1] and let [formula], for the preconditioner [formula], we have

[formula]

[\eqref=ine:prec-B1-cond] follows from Theorem [\ref=thm:prec-B] and the fact that [formula].

Clearly, Theorems [\ref=ine:prec-B-cond] and [\ref=ine:prec-B1-cond] imply that, when the weights on the internal edges of the disaggregation are chosen to be large enough, preconditioners for disaggregated graph provide effective preconditioners for the original graph, which indirectly supports the technique suggested in [\cite=Kuhlemann.V;Vassilevski.P2013a].
