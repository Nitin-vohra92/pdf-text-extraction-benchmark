Packing graphs of bounded codegree

Ross J. Kang

Let G1 and G2 be graphs on n vertices. (All graphs are assumed to have neither loops nor multiple edges.) We say that G1 and G2 pack if there exist injective mappings of their vertex sets into [formula] so that their edge sets have disjoint images. Equivalently, G1 and G2 pack if G1 is a subgraph of the complement of G2. The maximum codegree [formula] of a graph G is the maximum over all vertex pairs of their common degree, i.e. [formula] if and only if G contains no copy of the complete bipartite graph K2,t. The maximum adjacent codegree [formula] of G is the maximum over all pairs of adjacent vertices of their common degree, i.e. [formula] if and only if G contains no copy of the complete tripartite graph K1,1,s. Clearly, [formula] always. We let Δ1 and Δ2 denote the maximum degrees of G1 and G2, respectively, and [formula] and [formula] the corresponding maximum (adjacent) codegrees. We provide sufficient conditions for G1 and G2 to pack in terms of Δ1, Δ2, [formula], [formula].

For integers t  ≥  2 and Δ2  ≥  1, we define

[formula]

Note α* is the larger solution to the equation (α - 1)2  -  γα = 0 and [formula].

Let G1 and G2 be graphs on n vertices with respective maximum degrees Δ1 and Δ2. Let [formula] be the maximum codegree of G1. Let t  ≥  2 be an integer and let α  >  α*  =  α*(t,Δ2) and 0  <  ε < 1 / 2 be reals. Then G1 and G2 pack if [formula] and n is larger than each of the following quantities:

[formula]

Let G1 and G2 be graphs on n vertices with respective maximum degrees Δ1 and Δ2. Let [formula] be the maximum codegree of G1 and [formula] the maximum adjacent codegree of G2. Let [formula] and t  ≥  2 be integers and let α  >  α*  =  α*(t,Δ2) be real. Then G1 and G2 pack if [formula], [formula], and n is larger than both of the following quantities:

[formula]

For better context, we compare Theorems [\ref=thm:blue] and [\ref=thm:bluered] to a line of work on graph packing that was initiated in the 1970s [\cite=BoEl78] [\cite=Cat74] [\cite=Cat76] [\cite=SaSp78]. The following is a central problem in the area.

Let G1 and G2 be graphs on n vertices with respective maximum degrees Δ1 and Δ2. Then G1 and G2 pack if (Δ1  +  1)(Δ2 + 1)  ≤  n + 1.

If true, the statement would be sharp and would significantly generalise a celebrated result of Hajnal and Szemerédi [\cite=HaSz70] on equitable colourings. Sauer and Spencer [\cite=SaSp78] showed that 2Δ1Δ2  <  n is a sufficient condition for G1 and G2 to pack, which is seen to be sharp when one of the graphs is a perfect matching. Thus far the Bollobás-Eldridge-Catlin (BEC) conjecture has been confirmed in the following special cases: Δ1  =  2 [\cite=AiBr93]; Δ1  =  3 and n sufficiently large [\cite=CSS03]; G1 bipartite and n sufficiently large [\cite=Csa07]; and G1 d-degenerate, Δ1  ≥  40d and Δ2  ≥  215 [\cite=BKN08]. Moreover, an approximate BEC condition, (Δ1  +  1)(Δ2 + 1)  ≤  3n / 5 + 1, is sufficient for G1 and G2 to pack, provided that Δ1,Δ2  ≥  300 [\cite=KKY08]. Theorem [\ref=thm:blue] implies the following.

Let G1,G2,Δ1,Δ2 and [formula] be as before. Let t  ≥  2 be an integer. Then G1 and G2 pack if Δ1Δ2  +  Δ1  ≤  n + 1 and [formula] and Δ1  >  17t  ·  Δ2.

Choose ε  =  (2t - 2) / (4t - 3) and α = 3 in Theorem [\ref=thm:blue]. Using that [formula], it follows that [formula]. So G1 and G2 pack.

The following results concerning the BEC-conjecture follow immediately.

Given an integer t  ≥  2, the BEC conjecture holds under the additional condition that the maximum codegree [formula] of G1 is less than t and Δ1  >  17t  ·  Δ2.

We were unable to avoid the linear dependence on Δ2 in the lower bound condition on Δ1. Although we have not seriously attempted to optimise the factor 17t above, Theorem [\ref=thm:bluered] improves on this factor under the additional assumption that [formula] is bounded, as exemplified by the following corollary.

Given an integer t  ≥  2, the BEC conjecture holds under the additional condition that the maximum codegree [formula] of G1 is less than t, G2 is triangle-free, and [formula].

Choose [formula] and s = 1 in Theorem [\ref=thm:bluered]. Using that [formula] and that [formula], it follows that [formula]. So G1 and G2 pack.

Structure of the paper

In the next section, we provide some notation and preliminary observations. In Section [\ref=sec:critical], we discuss the common features of a hypothetical critical counterexample to one of our theorems. In Section [\ref=sec:proofs], we prove Theorems [\ref=thm:blue] and [\ref=thm:bluered]. We conclude the paper with some remarks about the results, proofs and further possibilities.

Here we introduce some terminology which we use throughout. We often call G1 the blue graph and G2 the red graph. We treat the injective vertex mappings as labellings of the vertices from 1 to n. However, rather than saying, "the vertex in G1 (or G2) corresponding to the label i", we often only say, "vertex i", since this should never cause any confusion. Our proofs rely on accurately specifying the neighbourhood structure as viewed from a particular vertex. Let i∈[n]. The blue neighbourhood N1(i) of i is the set {j  |  ij∈E(G1)} and the blue degree deg 1(i) of i is |N1(i)|. The red neighbourhood N2(i) and red degree N2(i) are defined analogously. For j∈[n], a red-blue-link (or 2-1-link) from i to j is a vertex i' such that ii'∈E(G2) and i'j∈E(G1). The red-blue-neighbourhood N1(N2(i)) of i is the set [formula]. A blue-red-link (or 1-2-link) and the blue-red-neighbourhood N2(N1(i)) are defined analogously.

In search of a certificate that G1 and G2 pack, without loss of generality, we keep the vertex labelling of the blue graph G1 fixed, and permute only the labels in the red graph G2. This can be thought of as "moving" the red graph above a fixed ground set

[formula]

equals the union of the neighbourhood sets that occur in the upper bound.

The union of N2(u), A*(u) and N1(N2(u)) covers [formula], which by Claim [\ref=clm:links1] equals

[formula]

.

By the proof of (i),

[formula]

also is the union of A*(u), A*(v) and [formula].

The reason for working with N*1(u) and A*(u) rather than the simpler sets N1(u) and A(u) is the following. Under the requirement that the codegree [formula] of G1 is less than t, we can upper bound |N*1(u)| entirely in terms of Δ2. This is sharper than the trivial bound |N1(u)|  ≤  Δ1 because we work under conditions with Δ1 rather larger than Δ2. Similarly, since N*1(u)  ⊂  N1(u), we need to compensate for the loss of covered vertices by working with the slightly enlarged set A*(u), rather than A(u). The following claims use the condition [formula] (which is assumed by both theorems).

|N*1(u)|  ≤  (t - 1)  ·  Δ2.

Suppose [formula], then there is at least one x∈N2(u) such that [formula], which contradicts [formula].

The following claim (in combination with Corrádi's lemma) is useful for an upper bound on |B(u)| that is only linear in Δ2, provided that |A*(u)| is at least quadratic in Δ2. See Case [\ref=case:blue1] in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:blue].

For any b∈B(u), [formula].

For all b∈N1(N2(u)) it holds that [formula]. Indeed, otherwise there would exist a blue copy of K2,t in the graph induced by [formula]. Similarly, [formula] and [formula]. So for every b∈N1(N2(u)), at most t  ·  (Δ2  +  1) blue neighbours of b are in [formula]. So in particular, for every b∈B(u), at most t  ·  (Δ2  +  1) blue neighbours of b are in [formula].

Using Claim [\ref=clm:links2] and the fact that each blue neighbour of a fixed b∈B(u) has at most Δ2 red neighbours in A*(u), we see that every b∈B(u) has at least ⌈|A*(u)| / Δ2⌉ blue neighbours, and thus at least |A*(u)| / Δ2 - t(Δ2 + 1) blue neighbours in A*(u).

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:blue]

Suppose the theorem is false. Consider a critical counterexample, a pair of non-packable graphs (G1,G2), with G2 edge-minimal, satisfying the constraints of the theorem. We distinguish three cases, for each of which we derive an upper bound on n, given by one of the inequalities [\eqref=case1bound], [\eqref=case2bound] and [\eqref=case3bound]. At least one of these three inequalities should hold, so together they contradict the condition that [formula], thus proving the theorem.

There exists a vertex u∈[n] and there are labellings of G1 and G2 such that u is incident to the unique purple edge and |A*(u)|  ≥  αt  ·  Δ2(Δ2 + 1).

Case [\ref=case:blue1] does not hold and furthermore [formula] for some edge uv∈E(G2).

Neither of Cases [\ref=case:blue1] and [\ref=case:blue2] hold.

We now proceed with deriving upper bounds on n for each of these three cases.

Bound for Case [\ref=case:blue1].

Choose a vertex u∈[n] and labellings of G1 and G2 such that u is incident to the unique purple edge and |A*(u)|  ≥  αt  ·  Δ2(Δ2 + 1). See Figure [\ref=fig:blue1] for a depiction of the argumentation in this case. From now on, we write k: = |A*(u)| / Δ2 - t(Δ2 + 1). Our first tool is Claim [\ref=clm:kclaim], which yields that all b∈B(u) satisfy [formula]. Note that k  ≥  1, since α  >  1. Our second tool is Corrádi's lemma, or rather Corollary [\ref=CorCor], which we apply with X = A*(u) and N = |B(u)| and with size ≥  k subsets [formula] given by [formula], for all b∈B(u). Note that [formula] for all i  ≠  j, or else there would be a blue copy of K2,t.

In order to apply Corollary [\ref=CorCor], we need to check that its condition k2  >  (t - 1)  ·  |A*(u)| holds. For that, we write β: = |A*(u)| / (tΔ2(Δ2 + 1)), so that k = (β - 1)t(Δ2 + 1). Now

[formula]

which is positive if and only if (β - 1)2  -  γβ > 0, which holds true because β  ≥  α  >  α*. Thus, by Corollary [\ref=CorCor], we obtain

[formula]

The numerator and denominator of the right hand side are both positive, so we can bound and rearrange as follows:

[formula]

where the last step holds because β  ≥  α  >  α* and α* is the larger singular point of [formula], which is a decreasing function of β for all β  >  α*.

Evaluating [\eqref=kopjethee2] and Claim [\ref=clm:truncatedblueneighbourhood] in the upper bound of Claim [\ref=clm:UpperBoundsN][\ref=clm:UpperBoundsN2] yields

[formula]

Bound for Case [\ref=case:blue2].

Choose labellings of G1 and G2 such that there is a unique purple edge uv that satisfies [formula]. Note that the inequalities |A*(u)|  <  αt  ·  Δ2(Δ2 + 1) and |A*(v)|  <  αt  ·  Δ2(Δ2 + 1) are satisfied as well, as a direct consequence of the assumptions of Case [\ref=case:blue2].

We proceed with deriving a technical estimate on an intersection of neighbourhood sets. For each [formula] and [formula] we have x  ≠  y and therefore absence of blue copies of K2,t implies the inequality [formula]. So

[formula]

Furthermore, since [formula],

[formula]

See Figure [\ref=fig:blue2]. Finally, we evaluate this in Claim [\ref=clm:UpperBoundsN][\ref=clm:UpperBoundsN3] to find the following bound on n:

[formula]

In particular, this implies the slightly rougher bound

[formula]

Bound for Case [\ref=case:blue3].

Choose a pair of labellings of G1 and G2 that induces a unique purple edge uv. The assumptions of this case imply, in particular, that in the red graph the neighbourhoods of each pair of adjacent vertices overlap significantly: [formula] for each xy∈E(G2).

We will derive two consequences, namely the implication

[formula]

and the inequality

[formula]

We start with proving the statement [\eqref=firstconsequence], the first consequence. See Figure [\ref=fig:blue3first]. Suppose [formula] has a red neighbour x∈N2(u). Then ux and ax are edges of G2, so [formula] and [formula]. Combining this with the obvious fact that |N2(x)|  ≤  Δ2 yields that

[formula]

Let us define

[formula]

It follows from [\eqref=plasticzakje] that [formula], so

[formula]

and (crucially) since [formula], it follows that

[formula]

Next, suppose we would have that |A*(u)|  ≥  1 + |N2(u)|  +  |A*  *(u)|. Then there exists a vertex [formula]. By the definition of A*  *(u), this vertex satisfies [formula]. Furthermore, since a∈A*(u), we have that for all b∈B(u) there is a red-blue-link from a to b. In other words, [formula]. This implies that [formula], where the last inequality is a consequence of the facts that [formula] and G1 does not contain a copy of K2,t. In summary, we have shown the implication

[formula]

Combining [\eqref=astersteru] and [\eqref=protoimplicatie] yields our first desired main consequence [\eqref=firstconsequence].

We now prove inequality [\eqref=secondconsequence], the second consequence. See Figure [\ref=fig:blue3second]. First, the absence of blue copies of K2,t implies that for every x∈N2(u) we have [formula]. Therefore

[formula]

In other words, for at most Δ2  ·  (t - 1) vertices y∈N1(u) there is a red-blue-link from u to y. Recalling that there is a link from u to every vertex (possibly with the exception of v), it follows that there are at least h: = |N1(u)|  -  (t - 1)Δ2 - 1 vertices y∈N1(u) for which there is a blue-red-link (and no red-blue-link) from u to y. In other words, [formula]. It follows from the definition of blue-red-link that any [formula] is connected to at least one other vertex [formula] by a red edge. If m is even, this means that there exists a matching of [formula] consisting of red edges [formula]. Each of these edges has a large common red neighbourhood: for all [formula] it holds that [formula]. So

[formula]

If, on the other hand, m is odd, then the same (or actually an even better) bound holds, because there exists a near-matching of [formula] with red edges [formula] and a red 2-path consisting of edges ym - 2ym and ym - 1ym satisfying [formula].

Last, note that

[formula]

We are now ready to derive [\eqref=secondconsequence]:

[formula]

Since Δ2  ≥  0 and ε < 1 / 2, the function g(x) is nonincreasing on the whole of [formula]. Since h  ≤  m, it follows that g(m)  ≤  g(h). So

[formula]

as desired.

Finally, we evaluate [\eqref=firstconsequence] and [\eqref=secondconsequence] in the bounds on n given by Claim [\ref=clm:UpperBoundsN], parts [\ref=clm:UpperBoundsN1] and [\ref=clm:UpperBoundsN2], to obtain

[formula]

where we employed [\eqref=firstconsequence] and [\eqref=secondconsequence] only in the last line.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:bluered]

Suppose the theorem is false. Consider a critical counterexample, a pair of non-packable graphs (G1,G2) satisfying the constraints of the theorem, such that there is a near-packing with a unique purple edge uv. We distinguish two cases, Cases [\ref=case:bluered1] and [\ref=case:bluered2]. From the first we derive the inequality [\eqref=case1bound_SB] and from the second we obtain the inequality [\eqref=case2bound_SB]. Together they contradict the condition that [formula], thus proving the theorem.

|A*(u)|  ≥  αt  ·  Δ2(Δ2 + 1) or |A*(v)|  ≥  αt  ·  Δ2(Δ2 + 1).

Without loss of generality, we assume |A*(u)|  ≥  αt  ·  Δ2(Δ2 + 1). From here the proof is the same as for Case [\ref=case:blue1] in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:blue], leading to the same bound,

[formula]

Case [\ref=case:bluered1] does not hold.

From here we proceed almost exactly as for Case [\ref=case:blue2] in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:blue], the difference being that instead of the upper bound [formula] we use [formula], which holds due to the additional condition [formula]. (Compare with [\eqref=case2bound].) It follows that

[formula]

Concluding remarks

We wish to make the following remarks about Theorems [\ref=thm:blue] and [\ref=thm:bluered].

In Theorem [\ref=thm:blue], the bottleneck is the quantity [\eqref=eqn:blue2], which corresponds to the bound [\eqref=case2bound] of Case [\ref=case:blue2]. So improving in this case would improve the overall bound on n, albeit not by much.

The condition in Theorem [\ref=thm:bluered] that [formula] is equivalent to "[formula] for all xy∈E(G2)". With a little adaptation, we can replace this by the weaker but perhaps obscure condition that G2 has no subgraph G!2 such that [formula] for all xy∈E(G!2). Indeed, this property is invariant under edge removal, and so holds for an edge-minimal critical counterexample, which therefore has an edge uv with [formula], for which we can choose labellings such that uv is the unique purple edge. From here, one again proceeds exactly as in Case [\ref=case:blue2] of the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:blue].

Theorem [\ref=thm:bluered] yields a better bound than Theorem [\ref=thm:blue] only if Δ1 is much larger than Δ2 and s, t are both small.

By taking G2 to be a collection of (nearly) equal-sized cliques, Corollary [\ref=cor:blue0] implies that, if G is a K2,t-free graph of maximum degree Δ with [formula], then the equitable chromatic number of G is at most Δ. Note that this result cannot be obtained by the result of Hajnal and Szmerédi on equitable colourings [\cite=HaSz70].

The BEC conjecture notwithstanding, naturally one might wonder whether Theorem [\ref=thm:blue], or rather Corollary [\ref=cor:blue], could be improved according to a weaker form of the BEC condition, as was the case for d-degenerate G1 [\cite=BKN08]. In other words, it would be interesting to improve upon the Ω(Δ1Δ2) terms appearing in each of [\eqref=eqn:blue1]-[\eqref=eqn:blue4]. We leave this to further study, but point out the following constructions where G1 has low maximum codegree, which mark boundaries for this problem.

When n is even, there are non-packable pairs (G1,G2) of graphs where G1 is a perfect matching (so [formula]) and 2Δ1Δ2  =  n, cf. [\cite=KaKo07].

Bollobás, Kostochka and Nakprasit [\cite=BKN05] exhibited a family of non-packable pairs (G1,G2) of graphs where G1 is a forest (so [formula]) and Δ1 ln Δ2  ≥  cn for some c > 0.

If [formula], then the chromatic number of G satisfies χ(G)  =  O(Δ(G) /  ln Δ(G)) as Δ(G)  →    ∞  , and there are standard examples having arbitrarily large girth that show this bound to be sharp up to a constant factor, cf. [\cite=MoRe02]. Since the equitable chromatic number is at least the chromatic number, these examples moreover yield non-packable pairs (G1,G2) of graphs having [formula] for some c  >  0 and [formula].

Since the examples can also have the maximum adjacent codegree [formula] being zero, this last remark hints at another natural line to pursue, which could significantly extend both the result of Csaba [\cite=Csa07] and a result of Johansson [\cite=Joh96]. If Δ1 is large enough and G1 is triangle-free, is some condition of the form [formula] for some constant c > 0 sufficient for G1 and G2 to pack?
