Eigensystem Bootstrap Multiscale Analysis for the Anderson Model

Introduction

The eigensystem multiscale analysis is a new approach for proving localization for the Anderson model introduced by Elgart and Klein [\cite=EK]. The usual proofs of localization for random Schrödinger operators are based on the study of finite volume Green's functions [\cite=FS] [\cite=FMSS] [\cite=Dr] [\cite=DK] [\cite=Sp] [\cite=CH] [\cite=FK] [\cite=GKboot] [\cite=Kle] [\cite=BK] [\cite=GKber] [\cite=AM] [\cite=A] [\cite=ASFH] [\cite=AENSS]. In contrast to the usual strategy, the eigensystem multiscale analysis is based on finite volume eigensystems, not finite volume Green's functions. It treats all energies of the finite volume operator at the same time, establishing level spacing and localization of eigenfunctions in a fixed box with high probability. A new feature is the labeling of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions by the sites of the box.

In this paper we use a bootstrap argument as in [\cite=GKboot] to enhance the eigensystem multiscale analysis. It yields exponential localization of finite volume eigenfunctions in boxes of side L, with the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions labeled by the sites of the box, with probability higher than [formula], for any 0 < ξ < 1. The starting hypothesis for the eigensystem bootstrap multiscale analysis only requires the verification of polynomial decay of the finite volume eigenfunctions, at some sufficiently large scale, with some minimal probability independent of the scale. The advantage of the bootstrap multiscale analysis is that from the same starting hypothesis we get conclusions that are valid for any 0 < ξ < 1.

We consider the Anderson model in the following form.

The Anderson model is the random Schrödinger operator

[formula]

where ε > 0; Δ is the (centered) discrete Laplacian:

[formula]

Vω(x) = ωx for [formula], where [formula] is a family of independent identically distributed random variables, with a non-degenerate probability distribution μ with bounded support and Hölder continuous of order [formula]:

[formula]

with [formula] the concentration function of the measure μ and K a constant.

Given [formula], we let TΘ  =  χΘTχΘ be the restriction of the bounded operator T on [formula] to [formula]. If [formula], we identify [formula] with a subset of [formula] by extending functions on Φ to functions on Θ that are identically 0 on [formula]. We write φΦ  =  χΦφ if φ is a function on Θ. We let [formula] and [formula] for [formula].

For [formula] we set [formula], [formula], and [formula]. Given [formula], we let [formula] denote its diameter, and set [formula] for [formula].

We use boxes in [formula] centered at points in [formula]. The box in [formula] of side L > 0 centered at [formula] is given by

[formula]

We write ΛL to denote a box ΛL(x) for some [formula]. We have (L - 2)d < |ΛL|  ≤  (L + 1)d for [formula], where for a set [formula] we let [formula] denote its cardinality.

The following definitions are for a fixed discrete Schrödinger operator Hε. We omit ε from the notation (i.e., we write H for Hε, HΘ for Hε,Θ) when it does not lead to confusion. We always consider scales [formula], and, for τ∈(0,1), set

[formula]

For fixed q > 0, β,τ∈(0,1), we have the following definitions:

Let ΛL be a box, x∈ΛL, and [formula] with [formula]. Then:

Given [formula], φ is said to be [formula]-polynomially localized if

[formula]

Given [formula], φ is said to be [formula]-subexponentially localized if

[formula]

Given m > 0, φ is said to be (x,m)-localized if

[formula]

Let R > 0, and [formula] be a finite set such that all eigenvalues of HΘ are simple (i.e., |σ(HΘ)| = |Θ|). Then:

Θ is called R-polynomially level spacing for HΘ if |λ  -  λ'|  ≥  R- q for all λ,λ'∈σ(HΘ),λ  ≠  λ'.

Θ is called R-level spacing for HΘ if [formula] for all λ,λ'∈σ(HΘ),λ  ≠  λ'.

When Θ  =  ΛL, a box, and R = L, we will just say that ΛL is polynomially level spacing for HΛL, or ΛL is level spacing for HΛL.

Note that R-polynomially level spacing implies R-level spacing for sufficiently large R.

Given [formula], (φ,λ) is called an eigenpair for HΘ if [formula], [formula] with [formula], and HΘφ  =  λφ (i.e., λ is an eigenvalue for HΘ with a corresponding normalized eigenfunction φ). A collection {(φj,λj)}j∈J of eigenpairs for HΘ is called an eigensystem for HΘ if {φj}j∈J is an orthonormal basis for [formula]. We may rewrite the eigensystem as {(ψλ,λ)}λ∈σ(HΘ) if all eigenvalues of HΘ are simple.

Let ΛL be a box. Then:

Given [formula], ΛL will be called [formula]-polynomially localizing (PL) for H if the following holds:

ΛL is polynomially level spacing for HΛL.

There exists a [formula]-polynomially localized eigensystem for HΛL, that is, an eigensystem {(φx,λx)}x∈ΛL for HΛL such that φx is [formula]-polynomially localized for all x∈ΛL.

Given [formula], ΛL will be called [formula]-mix localizing (ML) for H if the following holds:

ΛL is polynomially level spacing for HΛL.

There exists an [formula]-localized eigensystem for HΛL, that is, an eigensystem {(φx,λx)}x∈ΛL for HΛL such that φx is [formula]-localized for all x∈ΛL.

Given [formula], ΛL will be called [formula]-subexponentially localizing (SEL) for H if the following holds:

ΛL is level spacing for HΛL.

There exists an [formula]-subexponentially localized eigensystem for HΛL, that is, an eigensystem {(φx,λx)}x∈ΛL for HΛL such that φx is [formula]-subexponentially localized for all x∈ΛL.

Given m > 0, ΛL will be called m-localizing (LOC) for H if the following holds:

ΛL is level spacing for HΛL.

There exists an m-localized eigensystem for HΛL.

It follows immediately from the definition that given [formula],

[formula]

for sufficiently large L. (We consider [formula].)

We now state the bootstrap multiscale analysis. We will use [formula], [formula], [formula], etc., to denote a finite constant depending on the parameters [formula]. Note that [formula] may denote different constants in different equations, and even in the same equation. We will omit the dependence on d and μ from the notation.

Given [formula] and 0 < ξ < 1, we introduce the following parameters:

We fix q,p,γ1 such that and note that

[formula]

We fix ζ,β,γ,τ such that and note that

We fix s such that

[formula]

and note that

[formula]

We also let

[formula]

In what follows, given [formula], we fix q,p,γ1 as in [\eqref=thetaqp], and then, given 0 < ξ < 1, we fix ζ,β,γ,τ as in [\eqref=zetabetagammatau]. We use Definitions [\ref=defallloc]-[\ref=deflocbox] with these fixed q,β,τ, which we omit from the dependence of the constants.

Let [formula] and ε0 > 0. There exists a finite scale L(ε0,θ) with the following property: Suppose for some ε∈(0,ε0], L0  ≥  L(ε0,θ), and [formula], we have

[formula]

Then, given 0 < ξ < 1, we can find a finite scale [formula] and [formula] such that

[formula]

The eigensystem bootstrap multiscale analysis, stated in Theorem [\ref=mainthm], follows from a repeated use of a bootstrap argument, as in [\cite=GKboot], making successive use of Propositions [\ref=propmsa1], [\ref=indumsa1one], [\ref=propmsa2], [\ref=propmsa3], [\ref=indumsa3two], and [\ref=propmsa4]. Propositions [\ref=propmsa1], [\ref=propmsa2], [\ref=propmsa3], and [\ref=propmsa4] are eigensystem multiscale analyses. But there is a difference in the procedure comparing with the Green's function bootstrap multiscale analysis of [\cite=GKboot]. Unlike the definitions of good boxes for the Green's function multiscale analyses, the definitions of good (i.e., localizing) boxes for the eigensystem multiscale analyses, given in Definition [\ref=deflocbox], require intermediate scales, namely [formula] and Lτ in Definition [\ref=defallloc]. For this reason we only have the direct implications given in Remark [\ref=rmk1]. Thus the bootstrap between the eigensystem multiscale analyses requires some extra intermediate steps, given in Propositions [\ref=indumsa1one] and [\ref=indumsa3two].

In Section [\ref=sectinit] we will prove that we can fulfill the hypotheses of Theorem [\ref=mainthm], obtaining the following theorem.

There exists ε0 > 0 such that, given 0 < ξ < 1, we can find a finite scale [formula] and [formula] such that for all 0 < ε  ≤  ε0 we have

[formula]

Theorem [\ref=maincor] yields all the usual forms of localization. To see this, we introduce some notation and definitions. We fix [formula], and set [formula].

A function [formula] is called a ν-generalized eigenfunction for Hε if ψ is a generalized eigenfunction (see [\eqref=pteig]) and [formula]. We let Vε(λ) denote the collection of ν-generalized eigenfunctions for Hε with generalized eigenvalue [formula].

Given [formula] and [formula], we set

[formula]

Theorem [\ref=maincor] yields the following theorem, from which one can derive Anderson localization (pure point spectrum with exponentially decaying eigenfunctions) dynamical localization, and more, as in [\cite=EK].

Let Hε,ω be an Anderson model. There exists ε0 > 0 such that, given ξ∈(0,1), we can find a scale L̂  =  L̂(ε0,ξ) and mξ = m(ξ,L̂) > 0, such that for all 0 < ε  ≤  ε0, L  ≥  L̂ with [formula], and [formula] there exists an event Yε,L,a with the following properties:

Yε,L,a depends only on the random variables {ωx}x∈Λ5L(a), and

[formula]

For all ω∈Yε,L,a and [formula] we have, with

[formula]

where

[formula]

In particular,

[formula]

Theorem [\ref=thmloc] is proved in the same way as [\cite=EK].

Preliminaries to the multiscale analysis

We consider a fixed discrete Schrödinger operator H =  - εΔ + V on [formula], where 0 < ε  ≤  ε0 for a fixed ε0 and V is a bounded potential.

Some basic facts and definitions

Let [formula]. We define the boundary, exterior boundary, and interior boundary of Φ relative to Θ, respectively, by

[formula]

We have

[formula]

[formula]

For [formula] we set

[formula]

Given a box [formula] we write ΛΘ,tL(x) for (ΛL(x))Θ,t.

For a box [formula], there exists a unique [formula] for each [formula] such that (,v)∈∂ΛLΘ. Given v∈Θ, we define [formula] as above if [formula], and set  = v otherwise. Note that [formula]. If [formula], we have

[formula]

To cover a box of side L by boxes of side [formula], we will use suitable covers as in [\cite=EK] (also see [\cite=GKber]).

Let ΛL  =  ΛL(x0), [formula] be a box in [formula], and let [formula]. A suitable [formula]-cover of ΛL is the collection of boxes

[formula]

where

[formula]

We call [formula] the suitable [formula]-cover of ΛL if [formula].

Note that [formula] if [formula]. For a suitable [formula]-cover [formula], we have (see [\cite=EK])

[formula]

Lemmas about eigenpairs

Given [formula] and an eigensystem {(φj,λj)}j∈J for HΘ. We have

[formula]

Given [formula], a function [formula] is called a generalized eigenfunction for HΘ with generalized eigenvalue [formula] if ψ is not identically zero and

[formula]

or, equivalently,

[formula]

If [formula], ψ is an eigenfunction for HΘ with eigenvalue λ. We do not require generalized eigenfunctions to be in [formula], we only require the pointwise equality in [\eqref=pteig]. If Θ is finite there is no difference between generalized eigenfunctions and eigenfunctions.

Let a box [formula], and suppose (φ,λ) is an eigenpair for HΛL. Then:

Given [formula], if φ is [formula]-polynomially localized for some x∈ΛΘ,L'L, we have

[formula]

Given [formula], if φ is [formula]-subexponentially localized for some x∈ΛΘ,L'L, we have

Given m > 0 and τ∈(0,1), if φ is (x,m) localized for some x∈ΛΘ,LτL, we have

We prove part (i), the proofs of (ii) and (iii) are similar. If x∈ΛΘ,L'L, we have [formula], thus it follows from [\cite=EK] that

[formula]

For the following lemmas in this and next subsections, we fix [formula] and 0 < ξ < 1 (so q,p,γ1,ζ,β,γ,τ,s are fixed). Also, when we consider [formula] to be a [formula] box, where [formula] stands for θ-PL, [formula]-ML, s-SEL or m-LOC, with [formula] and [formula], we let:

[formula]

where [formula]. We will omit the dependence on θ, ξ and Y from the notation.

We prove most of the lemmas only for [formula] being θ-PL. The proofs of other cases are similar.

Given [formula], let [formula] be a generalized eigenfunction for HΘ with generalized eigenvalue [formula]. Consider a [formula] box [formula] with a corresponding eigensystem [formula], and suppose for all [formula] we have

[formula]

Then the following holds for sufficiently large [formula]:

Let [formula]. Then:

If [formula] is θ-PL, we have

[formula]

If [formula] is s-SEL, we have

If [formula] is [formula]-ML, we have

If [formula] is m-LOC, we have

Let [formula]. Then:

If [formula] is [formula]-ML, we have

If [formula] is m-LOC, we have

Let [formula], we have (see [\eqref=eigsys])

[formula]

If [formula], we have [formula] by [\eqref=disteig]. Using [\eqref=pteig], we get

[formula]

It follows from [\cite=EK] that

[formula]

If [formula], we have [formula], so [\eqref=defploc] gives [formula]. It follows from [\eqref=vphipsi1] and [formula] that

[formula]

for some [formula]. Therefore

[formula]

for some [formula].

Let [formula]. If [formula], we have [formula], thus [\eqref=defploc] gives [formula], and hence

[formula]

for some [formula]. Combining [\eqref=sum1], [\eqref=sum2] and [\eqref=sum3], we conclude that

[formula]

for some [formula]. If [formula] we repeat the procedure to estimate |ψ(y1)|. Since we can suppose [formula] without loss of generality, the procedure must stop after finitely many times, and at that time we must have [\eqref=decayes1].

We prove part (ii) only for [formula] being [formula]-ML. The proof for [formula] being m-LOC is similar. Let [formula], then [formula] for [formula]. Thus for [formula] and [formula] we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

since for [formula], we have

[formula]

Combining [\eqref=vphipsi1] and [\eqref=vphipsi3str], we conclude that

[formula]

for some [formula], where we used [formula] and took

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

for some [formula], where

[formula]

If [formula] we have [formula], thus [\eqref=defloc] gives [formula]. Also, [\eqref=defloc] implies

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

so we get

[formula]

for some [formula], where we used [formula] and took

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

for some [formula], where

[formula]

Combining [\eqref=sum1], [\eqref=sum4str], and [\eqref=sum5str], we conclude that

[formula]

where [formula] is given in [\eqref=mst3]. If [formula] we repeat the procedure to estimate |ψ(y1)|. Since we can suppose [formula] without loss of generality, the procedure must stop after finitely many times, and at that time we must have

[formula]

If [formula], [\eqref=decayes2str] follows immediately from [\eqref=decayest2str].

Given a finite set [formula], let {(ψλ,λ)}λ∈σ(HΘ) be an eigensystem for HΘ.

Then the following holds for sufficiently large [formula]:

Let [formula], where [formula], be a [formula]-localizing box with a corresponding eigensystem [formula], and let Θ be L-polynomially level spacing for H if [formula] is θ-PL or [formula]-ML, L-level spacing for H if [formula] is s-SEL or m-LOC.

There exists an injection

[formula]

such that for all [formula]:

If [formula] is θ-PL, we have

[formula]

and, multiplying each φ(a)x by a suitable phase factor,

[formula]

If [formula] is s-SEL, we have

[formula]

and, multiplying each φ(a)x by a suitable phase factor,

[formula]

If [formula] is [formula]-ML, we have

[formula]

and, multiplying each φ(a)x by a suitable phase factor,

[formula]

If [formula] is m-LOC, we have

[formula]

and, multiplying each φ(a)x by a suitable phase factor,

[formula]

Set

[formula]

Then if λ∈σ{a}(HΘ), for all [formula] we have

[formula]

If [formula], for all [formula] we have

[formula]

and for all [formula],

[formula]

for some [formula]. Moreover, for all [formula],

[formula]

for some [formula].

Let [formula], where [formula] such that [formula] for all a∈G, be a collection of [formula] boxes with corresponding eigensystems [formula] and let Θ be L-polynomially level spacing for H if [formula] is θ-PL or [formula]-ML, L-level spacing for H if [formula] is s-SEL or m-LOC. Set

[formula]

For a,b∈G, a  ≠  b, if [formula] and [formula],

[formula]

As a consequence,

[formula]

If λ∈σG(HΘ), we have for all [formula], where [formula],

[formula]

If [formula], we have for all [formula],

[formula]

If |Θ|  ≤  (L + 1)d, we have

[formula]

Let [formula], where [formula], be a θ-polynomially localizing box with a corresponding eigensystem [formula]. It follows from Lemma [\ref=distdecayall] that there exists [formula] satisfying [\eqref=tildedist] for [formula]. [formula] is unique since Θ is L-polynomially level spacing for HΘ and [formula]. Moreover, we have [formula] if [formula], x  ≠  y, since

[formula]

[formula] is polynomially level spacing for [formula], and [formula]. [\eqref=diffun] follows from [\cite=EK].

If λ∈σ{a}(HΘ), we have [formula] for some [formula], thus [\eqref=psidec0] follows from [\eqref=diffun] as φ(a)x(y) = 0 for all [formula].

If [formula], for all [formula] we have

[formula]

since Θ is L-polynomially level spacing for HΘ, we have [\eqref=tildedist], and [formula]. Therefore [\eqref=psidec1] follows from Lemma [\ref=psidecayall](i). (Note that [\eqref=pdec01] follows from Lemma [\ref=psidecayall](ii).)

Now let [formula], where [formula] such that [formula] for all a∈G, be a collection of θ-polynomially localizing boxes with corresponding eigensystems [formula]. Let λ∈σ(HΘ), a,b∈G, a  ≠  b, [formula] and [formula]. Assume λ(a)x,λ(b)x∈EΘG(λ), then it follows from [\eqref=diffun] that

[formula]

thus

[formula]

On the other hand, [\eqref=defploc] gives

[formula]

Combining [\eqref=invarphi1] and [\eqref=invarphi2], we conclude that

[formula]

To prove [\eqref=sigmaab], let a,b∈G, a  ≠  b. Assume [formula], then

[formula]

thus it follows from [\eqref=difxy] that [formula].

Parts (ii)(b) and (ii)(c) follow immediately from parts (i)(b) and (i)(c) respectively. To prove part (ii)(d), we let PG be the orthogonal projection onto the span of {ψλ;λ∈σG(HΘ)}. [\eqref=psidec4] gives

[formula]

thus

[formula]

If |Θ|  ≤  (L + 1)d, we have

[formula]

since d + q < γ1(d + q) < θ - 2d, so it follows from [\cite=EK] that

[formula]

Using a similar argument and [\eqref=psidec3], we can prove |σG(HΘ)|  ≤  |ΘG|.

Buffered subsets

For boxes [formula] that are not [formula] for H, we will surround them with a buffer of [formula] boxes and study eigensystems for the augmented subset.

Let ΛL  =  ΛL(x0) and [formula]. Υ  ⊂  ΛL is called a [formula]-buffered subset of ΛL, where [formula] stands for θ-PL, s-SEL, [formula]-ML or m-LOC, if the following holds:

Υ is a connected set in [formula] of the form

[formula]

where [formula], [formula], and [formula] for [formula].

Υ is L-polynomially level spacing for H if [formula] is θ-PL or [formula]-ML, L-level spacing for H if [formula] is s-SEL or m-LOC.

There exists [formula] such that:

For all a∈GΥ we have [formula], [formula] is a [formula] box for H.

For all [formula] there exists ay∈GΥ such that [formula].

In this case we set

[formula]

([formula] and [formula] in the notation of Lemma [\ref=ideigsysall].)

Given a [formula]-buffered subset Υ of ΛL, let {(ψν,ν)}ν∈σ(HΥ) be an eigensystem for HΥ. Let G  =  GΥ and set

[formula]

where σG(HΥ) is as in [\eqref=defE]. Then the following holds for sufficiently large [formula]:

If ν∈σB(HΥ) we have for all [formula]:

[formula]

and

[formula]

Let ΛL be polynomially level spacing for H if [formula] is θ-PL or [formula]-ML, level spacing for H if [formula] is s-SEL or m-LOC, and let {(φλ,λ)}λ∈σ(HΛL) be an eigensystem for HΛL. There exists an injection

[formula]

such that for all ν∈σB(HΥ):

If [formula] is θ-PL, we have

[formula]

and, multiplying each ψν by a suitable phase factor,

[formula]

If [formula] is s-SEL, we have

[formula]

and, multiplying each ψν by a suitable phase factor,

[formula]

If [formula] is [formula]-ML, we have

[formula]

and, multiplying each ψν by a suitable phase factor,

[formula]

If [formula] is m-LOC, we have

[formula]

and, multiplying each ψν by a suitable phase factor,

[formula]

Part (i) follows immediately from Lemma [\ref=ideigsysall](ii)(c) and (ii)(d).

Let ΛL be polynomially level spacing, and let {(φλ,λ)}λ∈σ(HΛL) be an eigensystem for HΛL. It follows from [\cite=EK] that for ν∈σB(HΥ) we have

[formula]

where we used [formula] and [\eqref=psidec5]. The map in [\eqref=injectbad] is a well defined injection into σ(HΛL) since ΛL and Υ are L-polynomially level spacing for H, and [\eqref=diffun2] follows from [\eqref=distnu] and [\cite=EK].

To show [formula] for all ν∈σB(HΥ), we assume [formula] for some ν1∈σB(HΥ). Then there is a∈G and [formula] such that [formula]. On the other hand, λ(a)x∈EΥG(λ1) for some λ1∈σG(HΥ) by Lemma [\ref=ideigsysall](i)(a). We conclude from [\eqref=diffun] and [\eqref=diffun2] that

[formula]

a contradiction.

Given ΛL  =  ΛL(x0), [formula], let Υ be a [formula]-buffered subset of ΛL. Let G  =  GΥ and set

[formula]

The following holds for sufficiently large [formula]:

Let (ψ,λ) be an eigenpair for HΛL such that for all [formula],

[formula]

Then for all [formula]:

If [formula] is θ-PL, we have

[formula]

If [formula] is s-SEL, we have

If [formula] is [formula]-ML, we have

If [formula] is m-LOC, we have

Let ΛL be polynomially level spacing for H if [formula] is θ-PL or [formula]-ML, level spacing for H if [formula] is s-SEL or m-LOC. Let {(ψλ,λ)}λ∈σ(HΛL) be an eigensystem for HΛL, and set (recalling [\eqref=injectbad])

[formula]

Then the condition [\eqref=disteig2] is satisfied for all [formula], so for all [formula]

[formula]

for some [formula].

Let {(ϑν,ν)}ν∈σ(HΥ) be an eigensystem for HΥ. For ν∈σG(HΥ) we fix λ(aν)xν∈EΥG(ν), where aν∈G, [formula]. If ν∈σΛLG(HΥ), we choose λ(aν)xν∈EΛLG(ν), thus [formula]. If [formula] we have [formula].

Given y∈Υ, we have (see [\eqref=eigsys])

[formula]

Let (ψ,λ) be an eigenpair for HΛL satisfying [\eqref=disteig2]. If [formula], we have

[formula]

It follows from [\eqref=disteig2] and [\cite=EK] that

[formula]

If ν∈σB(HΥ), [\eqref=psidec5] gives

[formula]

If ν∈σΛLG(HΥ), it follows from [\eqref=diffun] and [\eqref=defploc], that

[formula]

Therefore (recalling [\eqref=ca1]),

[formula]

for some [formula].

If [formula], we have [formula], thus

[formula]

and hence there is [formula] such that [formula]. We suppose [formula], then [formula]. Therefore

[formula]

Thus it follows from [\eqref=diffun] and [\eqref=defploc] that

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

for some v3∈Υ.

Combining [\eqref=sum6], [\eqref=sum7] and [\eqref=sum8], we conclude that for all [formula],

[formula]

for some [formula]. If [formula] we repeat the procedure to estimate |ψ(v4)|. Since we can suppose [formula] without loss of generality, the procedure must stop after finitely many times, and at that time we must have [\eqref=psidec6].

Now let ΛL be polynomially level spacing. If [formula], it follows from Lemma [\ref=ideigsysall](i)(c) that [\eqref=distlambda] holds for all a∈G. If [formula], using the argument in [\eqref=distlambda2], with [\eqref=distnu] instead of [\eqref=tildedist], we get [formula] for all ν∈σB(HΥ). Therefore we have [\eqref=disteig2], which implies [\eqref=psidec6].

Probability estimates

The following lemma gives the probability estimates for polynomially level spacing and level spacing.

Let Hε,ω be the Anderson model. Let [formula] and L > 1. Then, for all ε  ≤  ε0,

[formula]

and

[formula]

where

[formula]

with [formula] if α = 1 and [formula] if [formula].

Lemma [\ref=lemlsp] follows from [\cite=EK] and its proof. (Also see [\cite=KlM].)

Bootstrap multiscale analysis

In this section, we fix [formula] and 0 < ξ < 1. (Note that Proposition [\ref=propmsa1] is independent of ξ.) We will omit the dependence on θ and ξ from the notation. We denote the complementary event of an event E by Ec.

The first multiscale analysis

Fix ε0 > 0, [formula], and [formula]. There exists a finite scale L(ε0,Y) with the following property: Suppose for some scale L0  ≥  L(ε0,Y), and 0 < ε  ≤  ε0 we have

[formula]

Then, setting Lk + 1 = YLk for [formula], there exists [formula] such that

[formula]

Proposition [\ref=propmsa1] follows from the following induction step for the multiscale analysis.

Fix ε0 > 0, [formula], and [formula]. Suppose for some scale [formula] and 0 < ε  ≤  ε0 we have

[formula]

Then, if [formula] is sufficiently large, for [formula] we have

[formula]

We fix 0 < ε  ≤  ε0 and suppose [\eqref=hypmsaind] for some scale [formula]. Let ΛL  =  ΛL(x0), where [formula], and let [formula] be the suitable [formula]-cover of ΛL. For [formula], let BN denote the event that there exist at most N disjoint boxes in [formula] that are not θ-PL for Hε,ω. Using [\eqref=hypmsaind], [\eqref=covernum] and the fact that events on disjoint boxes are independent, if N = 1 we have

[formula]

We now fix ω∈BN. There exists [formula], with |AN|  ≤  N and [formula] (i.e., [formula]) if a,b∈AN, a  ≠  b, such that for all [formula] with [formula] (i.e., [formula] for all b∈AN), [formula] is a [formula] box for Hε,ω ([formula] stands for θ-PL). In other words,

[formula]

To embed the box [formula] into [formula]-buffered subsets of ΛL, we consider graphs [formula], i = 1,2, both having [formula] as the set of vertices, with sets of edges given by

[formula]

Let {Φr}Rr = 1  =  {Φr(ω)}Rr = 1 denote the [formula]-connected components of AN (i.e., connected in the graph G2). Note that

[formula]

Set

[formula]

and note that [formula] is a collection of disjoint, [formula]-connected subsets of [formula], such that

[formula]

Moreover, [\eqref=imploc] gives

[formula]

For [formula], we define the exterior boundary of Ψ in the graph [formula] by

[formula]

It follows from [\eqref=imploc2] that [formula] is [formula] for Hε,ω for all [formula], [formula]. Set [formula], and set, for [formula],

[formula]

Each Υr, [formula], satisfies all the requirements to be a θ-PL-buffered subset of ΛL with [formula] (see Definition [\ref=defbufall]), except that we do not know if Υr is L-polynomially level spacing for Hε,ω. (Note that the sets {Υ(0)r}Rr = 1 are disjoint, but the sets {Υr}Rr = 1 are not necessarily disjoint.) Note also that

[formula]

and hence

[formula]

thus

[formula]

We can arrange for {Υr}Rr = 1 to be a collection of θ-PL-buffered subsets of ΛL as follows. It follows from Lemma [\ref=lemlsp] that for any Θ  ⊂  ΛL we have

[formula]

Given a [formula]-connected subset Φ of [formula], let Υ(Φ)  ⊂  ΛL be constructed from Φ as in [\eqref=conups]. Set

[formula]

Let F(r,a) = {Φ∈Fr;a∈Φ} for [formula], and note that each vertex in the graph [formula] has less than d(3d - 1 + 4d - 1)  ≤  d4d nearest neighbors , we have

[formula]

Let SN denote the event that the box ΛL and the subsets {Υ(Φ)}Φ∈FN are all L-polynomially level spacing for Hε,ω, using [\eqref=probls] and [\eqref=cFN], if N = 1 we have

[formula]

for sufficiently large L since p < (2α - 1)q - 3d.

Let [formula]. Combining [\eqref=probb] and [\eqref=probs], we conclude that if N = 1,

[formula]

To finish the proof we need to show that for all ω∈EN the box ΛL is θ-PL for Hε,ω.

We fix ω∈EN. Then we have [\eqref=imploc2], ΛL is polynomially level spacing for Hε,ω, and the subsets {Υr}Rr = 1 constructed in [\eqref=conups] are θ-PL-buffered subsets of ΛL for Hε,ω. It follows from [\eqref=coverprop] and Definition [\ref=defbufall](iii) that

[formula]

We omit ε and ω from the notation since they are now fixed. Let {(ψλ,λ)}λ∈σ(HΛL) be an eigensystem for HΛL. For a∈G, let [formula] be a θ-polynomially localized eigensystem for [formula]. For [formula], let [formula] be an eigensystem for HΥr, and set

[formula]

where [formula] is given in [\eqref=injectbad], which also gives [formula], but the argument actually shows [formula]. We also set

[formula]

We claim

[formula]

To do this, we assume [formula]. Since ΛL is polynomially level spacing for H, Lemma [\ref=ideigsysall](ii)(c) gives

[formula]

and Lemma [\ref=lembadall](ii) gives

[formula]

Using [\eqref=Lamdecom] and [formula], we conclude that

[formula]

for sufficiently large [formula], a contradiction. This establishes the claim.

We now index the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of HΛL by sites in ΛL using Hall's Marriage Theorem, which states a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a perfect matching in a bipartite graph. (See [\cite=EK] and [\cite=BDM].) We consider the bipartite graph [formula], where the edge set [formula] is defined as follows. For each λ∈σG(HΛL) we fix λ(aλ)xλ∈EΛLG(λ), and set (recall [\eqref=defUpsck] and [\eqref=lsharp])

[formula]

We define

[formula]

and let [formula].

N(x) was defined to ensure |ψλ(x)|  ≪  1 for [formula]. This can be seen as follows:

If x∈ΛL and [formula], we have [formula] with [formula], so, using [\eqref=defploc] and [\eqref=diffun],

[formula]

If [formula] and λ∈σΥr(HΛL), then [formula] for some ν(r)∈σB(HΥ), and, using [\eqref=psidec5] and [\eqref=diffun2], (Note φν(r)(x) = 0 if [formula].)

[formula]

Therefore for all x∈ΛL and [formula] we have

[formula]

Since |ΛL| = |σ(HΛL)|, to apply Hall's Marriage Theorem we only need to verify |Θ|  ≤  |N(Θ)|, where [formula] for Θ  ⊂  ΛL. For Θ  ⊂  ΛL, let QΘ be the orthogonal projection onto the span of {ψλ;λ∈N(Θ)}. If [formula], for all x∈Θ we have [\eqref=psidec7], thus

[formula]

for sufficiently large [formula] since [formula], so it follows from [\cite=EK] that

[formula]

Using Hall's Marriage Theorem, we conclude that there exists a bijection

[formula]

We set ψx  =  ψλx for all x∈ΛL.

To finish the proof we need to show that {(ψx,λx)}x∈ΛL is a θ-polynomially localized eigensystem for ΛL. We fix N = 1, x∈ΛL, take y∈ΛL, and consider several cases:

Suppose λx∈σG(ΛL). Then [formula] with aλx∈G, and λx∈σ{aλx}(HΛL). In view of [\eqref=Lamdecom] we consider two cases:

If [formula] for some a∈G and [formula], we must have [formula], so it follows from [\eqref=sigmaab] that [formula], and [\eqref=psidec1] gives

[formula]

If [formula], and [formula], we must have [formula], so it follows from [\eqref=sigmaab] that [formula], and clearly [formula] in view of [\eqref=sigmasigma]. Thus Lemma [\ref=lembadall](ii) gives

[formula]

Suppose [formula]. Then it follows from [\eqref=sigmaclaim] that we must have λx∈σΥ1(HΛL). If [formula] for some a∈G, and [formula], we must have [formula], and [\eqref=psidec1] gives [\eqref=psigood].

Now we fix x∈ΛL, and take y∈ΛL such that [formula]. Suppose |ψx(y)| > 0 without loss of generality. We estimate |ψx(y)| using either [\eqref=psigood] or [\eqref=psibad] repeatedly, as appropriate, stopping when we get too close to x so we are not in any case described above. (Note that this must happen since |ψx(y)| > 0.) We accumulate decay only when using [\eqref=psigood], and just use [formula] when using [\eqref=psibad], then recalling [formula], we get

[formula]

where n(Y) is the number of times we used [\eqref=psigood]. We have

[formula]

Thus, using [\eqref=sumdiam], we have

[formula]

for sufficiently large [formula] since [formula]. It follows from [\eqref=repeatdec],

[formula]

for sufficiently large [formula] since 2(θ - 2d - q) = θ + (θ - 4d - 2q) > θ.

We conclude that {(ψx,λx)}x∈ΛL is a θ-polynomially localized eigensystem for ΛL, so the box ΛL is θ-polynomially localizing for Hε,ω.

We assume [\eqref=initcon] and set Lk + 1 = YLk for [formula]. We set

[formula]

Then by Lemma [\ref=indumsa1], we have

[formula]

If Pk  ≤  L- pk for some [formula], we have

[formula]

for L0 sufficiently large. Therefore to finish the proof, we need to show that

[formula]

It follows from [\eqref=calpk] that for any 1  ≤  k < K0,

[formula]

so

[formula]

Therefore for 1  ≤  k < K0, we have

[formula]

Since 2(2Y)2dP0 < 1, [\eqref=ineqpk] cannot be satisfied for large k. We conclude that K0  <    ∞  .

The first intermediate step

Fix ε0 > 0. Suppose for some scale [formula] and 0 < ε  ≤  ε0 we have

[formula]

Then, if [formula] is sufficiently large, for [formula] we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

We follow the proof of Lemma [\ref=indumsa1]. For [formula], let BN, SN and EN as in the proof of Lemma [\ref=indumsa1]. Using [\eqref=hypmsaindone], [\eqref=covernum] and the fact that events on disjoint boxes are independent, if N = 1 we have,

[formula]

for all [formula] sufficiently large since [formula]. Also, using [\eqref=probls] and [\eqref=cFN], if N = 1 we have,

[formula]

for sufficiently large L, since p < (2α - 1)q - 3d. Combining [\eqref=probbone] and [\eqref=probsone], we conclude that

[formula]

To finish the proof we need to show that for all ω∈EN the box ΛL is [formula]-mix localizing for Hε,ω, where [formula] is given in [\eqref=mst000]. Following the proof of Lemma [\ref=indumsa1], we get [\eqref=sigmaclaim] and obtain an eigensystem {(ψx,λx)}x∈ΛL for HΛL using Hall's Marriage Theorem. To finish the proof we need to show that {(ψx,λx)}x∈ΛL is an [formula]-localized eigensystem for ΛL. We proceed as in the proof of Lemma [\ref=indumsa1]. We fix N = 1, x∈ΛL, and take y∈ΛL such that [formula], we have

[formula]

where [formula] is the number of times we used [\eqref=psigood]. Thus, using [\eqref=sumdiam], we have

[formula]

for sufficiently large [formula]. It follows from [\eqref=repeatdec],

[formula]

for sufficiently large [formula].

We conclude that {(ψx,λx)}x∈ΛL is an [formula]-localized eigensystem for ΛL, where [formula] is given in [\eqref=mst000], so the box ΛL is [formula]-mix localizing for Hε,ω.

The second multiscale analysis

Fix ε0 > 0. There exists a finite scale L(ε0) with the following property: Suppose for some scale L0  ≥  L(ε0), 0 < ε  ≤  ε0, and [formula] where 0 < κ  <  τ, we have

[formula]

Then, setting Lk + 1 = Lγ1k for [formula], we have

[formula]

Proposition [\ref=propmsa2] follows from the following induction step for the multiscale analysis.

Fix ε0 > 0. Suppose for some scale [formula], 0 < ε  ≤  ε0, and [formula], where 0 < κ  <  τ, we have

[formula]

Then, if [formula] is sufficiently large, for [formula] we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

We follow the proof of Lemma [\ref=indumsa1]. For [formula], let BN denote the event that there do not exist two disjoint boxes in [formula] that are not [formula]-mix localizing for Hε,ω. Using [\eqref=hypmsaind2], [\eqref=covernum] and the fact that events on disjoint boxes are independent, if N = 1 we have

[formula]

for all [formula] sufficiently large since [formula].

We now fix ω∈BN, and proceed as in the proof of Lemma [\ref=indumsa1] with [formula] being [formula]-ML. Then we have Υr, [formula] such that each Υr satisfies all the requirements to be an [formula]-ML-buffered subset of ΛL with [formula], except we do not know if Υr is L-polynomially level spacing for Hε,ω.

Given a [formula]-connected subset Φ of [formula], let Υ(Φ)  ⊂  ΛL be constructed from Φ as in [\eqref=conups] with [formula] being [formula]-ML. Let SN denote the event that the box ΛL and the subsets {Υ(Φ)}Φ∈FN are all L-polynomially level spacing for Hε,ω. Using [\eqref=probls] and [\eqref=cFN], if N = 1 we have

[formula]

for sufficiently large L, since p < (2α - 1)q - 3d.

Let [formula]. Combining [\eqref=probb2] and [\eqref=probs2], we conclude that if N = 1,

[formula]

To finish the proof we need to show that for all ω∈EN the box ΛL is [formula]-mix localizing for Hε,ω, where [formula] is given in [\eqref=bigMst].

We fix ω∈EN. Then we have [\eqref=imploc2], ΛL is polynomially level spacing for Hε,ω, and the subsets {Υr}Rr = 1 constructed in [\eqref=conups] are [formula]-ML-buffered subset of ΛL for Hε,ω. We proceed as in the proof of Lemma [\ref=indumsa1]. To claim [\eqref=sigmaclaim], we assume [formula]. Since ΛL is polynomially level spacing for H, Lemma [\ref=ideigsysall](ii)(c) gives

[formula]

and Lemma [\ref=lembadall](ii) gives

[formula]

Using [\eqref=Lamdecom], we conclude that (note [formula])

[formula]

a contradiction. This establishes the claim.

To index the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of HΛL by sites in ΛL, we define N(x) as in [\eqref=defN] and proceed as in the proof of Lemma [\ref=indumsa1]. We have:

If x∈ΛL and [formula], we have [formula] with [formula], so, using [\eqref=defloc] and [\eqref=diffunstr],

[formula]

If [formula] and λ∈σΥr(HΛL), then [formula] for some ν(r)∈σB(HΥr), and, using [\eqref=psidec5] and [\eqref=diffun2str], (Note φν(r)(x) = 0 if [formula].)

[formula]

Therefore for all x∈ΛL and [formula] we have

[formula]

If [formula], for all x∈Θ we have [\eqref=psidec7str], thus

[formula]

Following the proof of Lemma [\ref=indumsa1], we can apply Hall's Marriage Theorem to obtain an eigensystem {(ψx,λx)}x∈ΛL for HΛL.

To finish the proof we need to show that {(ψx,λx)}x∈ΛL is an [formula]-localized eigensystem for ΛL, where [formula] is given in [\eqref=bigMst]. We fix N = 1, x∈ΛL, take y∈ΛL, and consider several cases:

Suppose λx∈σG(ΛL). Then [formula] with aλx∈G, and λx∈σ{aλx}(HΛL). In view of [\eqref=Lamdecom] we consider two cases:

If [formula] for some a∈G and [formula], we must have [formula], so it follows from [\eqref=sigmaab] that [formula], and [\eqref=pdec01] gives

[formula]

If [formula], and [formula], we must have [formula], so it follows from [\eqref=sigmaab] that [formula], and clearly [formula] in view of [\eqref=sigmasigma]. Thus Lemma [\ref=lembadall](ii) gives

[formula]

Suppose [formula]. Then it follows from [\eqref=sigmaclaim] that we must have λx∈σΥ1(HΛL). If [formula] for some a∈G, and [formula], we must have [formula], and [\eqref=pdec01] gives [\eqref=psigoodstr].

Now we fix x∈ΛL, and take y∈ΛL such that [formula]. Suppose |ψx(y)| > 0 without loss of generality. We estimate |ψx(y)| using either [\eqref=psigoodstr] or [\eqref=psibadstr] repeatedly, as appropriate, stopping when we get too close to x so we are not in any case described above. (Note that this must happen since |ψx(y)| > 0.) We accumulate decay only when using [\eqref=psigoodstr], and just use [formula] when using [\eqref=psibadstr], then we get

[formula]

where we used [\eqref=sumdiam] and took

[formula]

for [formula] sufficiently large, where we used [\eqref=mst3] and [formula].

We conclude that {(ψx,λx)}x∈ΛL is an [formula]-localized eigensystem for ΛL, where [formula] is given in [\eqref=bigMst], so the box ΛL is [formula]-mix localizing for Hε,ω.

We assume [\eqref=initcon2] and set Lk + 1 = Lγ1k for [formula]. If L0 is sufficiently large it follows from Lemma [\ref=indumsa2] by an induction argument that

[formula]

where for [formula] we have

[formula]

Thus for all [formula], taking L0 sufficiently large we get

[formula]

finishing the proof of Proposition [\ref=propmsa2].

The third multiscale analysis

Fix ε0 > 0, [formula], and [formula]. There exists a finite scale L(ε0,Y) with the following property: Suppose for some scale L0  ≥  L(ε0,Y) and 0 < ε  ≤  ε0 we have

[formula]

Then, setting Lk + 1 = YLk for [formula], there exists [formula] such that

[formula]

Proposition [\ref=propmsa3] follows from the following induction step for the multiscale analysis.

Fix ε0 > 0, [formula], and [formula]. Suppose for some scale [formula] and 0 < ε  ≤  ε0 we have

[formula]

Then, if [formula] is sufficiently large, for [formula] we have

[formula]

We follow the proof of Lemma [\ref=indumsa1]. For [formula], let BN denote the event that there exist at most N disjoint boxes in [formula] that are not s-SEL for Hε,ω. Using [\eqref=hypmsaind3], [\eqref=covernum] and the fact that events on disjoint boxes are independent, if N = ⌊Ys⌋ we have

[formula]

We now fix ω∈BN, and proceed as in the proof of Lemma [\ref=indumsa1] with [formula] being s-SEL. Then we have Υr, [formula] such that each Υr satisfies all the requirements to be an s-SEL-buffered subset of ΛL with [formula], except we do not know if Υr is L-level spacing for Hε,ω.

It follows from Lemma [\ref=lemlsp] that for any Θ  ⊂  ΛL we have

[formula]

Given a [formula]-connected subset Φ of [formula], let Υ(Φ)  ⊂  ΛL be constructed from Φ as in [\eqref=conups] with [formula] being s-SEL. Let SN denote the event that the box ΛL and the subsets the subsets {Υ(Φ)}Φ∈FN are all L-level spacing for Hε,ω. Using [\eqref=problssub] and [\eqref=cFN], if N = ⌊Ys⌋ we have

[formula]

for sufficiently large L, since ζ  <  β.

Let [formula]. Combining [\eqref=probbsub] and [\eqref=probssub], we conclude that

[formula]

To finish the proof we need to show that for all ω∈EN the box ΛL is s-SEL for Hε,ω.

We fix ω∈EN. Then we have [\eqref=imploc2], ΛL is level spacing for Hε,ω, and the subsets {Υr}Rr = 1 constructed in [\eqref=conups] are s-SEL-buffered subsets of ΛL for Hε,ω. We proceed as in the proof of Lemma [\ref=indumsa1]. To claim [\eqref=sigmaclaim], we assume [formula]. Since ΛL is level spacing for H, Lemma [\ref=ideigsysall](ii)(c) gives

[formula]

and Lemma [\ref=lembadall](ii) gives

[formula]

Using [\eqref=Lamdecom], we conclude that (note c4  ≤  c2)

[formula]

a contradiction. This establishes the claim.

To index the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of HΛL by sites in ΛL, we define N(x) as in [\eqref=defN] proceed as in the proof of Lemma [\ref=indumsa1]. We have:

If x∈ΛL and [formula], we have [formula] with [formula], so, using [\eqref=defsloc] and [\eqref=diffunsub],

[formula]

If [formula] and λ∈σΥr(HΛL), then [formula] for some ν(r)∈σB(HΥr), and, using [\eqref=psidec5] and [\eqref=diffun2sub], (Note φν(r)(x) = 0 if [formula].)

[formula]

Therefore for all x∈ΛL and [formula] we have

[formula]

If [formula], for all x∈Θ we have [\eqref=psidec7sub], thus

[formula]

Following the proof of Lemma [\ref=indumsa1], we can apply Hall's Marriage Theorem to obtain an eigensystem {(ψx,λx)}x∈ΛL for HΛL.

To finish the proof we need to show that {(ψx,λx)}x∈ΛL is an s-subexponentially localized eigensystem for ΛL. We fix N = ⌊Ys⌋, x∈ΛL, take y∈ΛL, and consider several cases:

Suppose λx∈σG(ΛL). Then [formula] with aλx∈G, and λx∈σ{aλx}(HΛL). In view of [\eqref=Lamdecom] we consider two cases:

If [formula] for some a∈G and [formula], we must have [formula], so it follows from [\eqref=sigmaab] that [formula], and [\eqref=psidec1] gives

[formula]

If [formula] for some [formula], and [formula], we must have [formula], so it follows from [\eqref=sigmaab] that [formula], and clearly [formula] in view of [\eqref=sigmasigma]. Thus Lemma [\ref=lembadall](ii) gives

[formula]

Suppose [formula]. Then it follows from [\eqref=sigmaclaim] that we must have [formula] for some [formula]. In view of [\eqref=Lamdecom] we consider two cases:

If [formula] for some a∈G, and [formula], we must have [formula], and [\eqref=psidec1] gives [\eqref=psigoodsub].

If [formula] for some [formula], and [formula], we must have [formula]. Thus Lemma [\ref=lembadall](ii) gives [\eqref=psibadsub].

Now we fix x∈ΛL, and take y∈ΛL such that [formula]. Suppose |ψx(y)| > 0 without loss of generality. We estimate |ψx(y)| using either [\eqref=psigoodsub] or [\eqref=psibadsub] repeatedly, as appropriate, stopping when we get too close to x so we are not in any case described above. (Note that this must happen since |ψx(y)| > 0.) We accumulate decay only when we use [\eqref=psigoodsub], and just use [formula] when using [\eqref=psibadsub], recalling [formula], then we get

[formula]

where n(Y) is the number of times we used [\eqref=psigoodsub]. We have

[formula]

Thus, using [\eqref=sumdiam], we have

[formula]

for sufficiently large [formula] since [formula]. It follows from [\eqref=repeatdecsub],

[formula]

for sufficiently large [formula].

We conclude that {(ψx,λx)}x∈ΛL is an s-subexponentially localized eigensystem for ΛL, so the box ΛL is s-SEL for Hε,ω.

We assume [\eqref=initcon3] and set Lk + 1 = YLk for [formula]. We set

[formula]

Then by Lemma [\ref=indumsa3], we have

[formula]

If [formula] for some [formula], we have

[formula]

for L0 sufficiently large, since ζ < s. Therefore to finish the proof, we need to show that

[formula]

It follows from [\eqref=calpksub] that for any 1  ≤  k < K0,

[formula]

so

[formula]

For 1  ≤  k < K0, since [formula], we have

[formula]

Since ζ < s, [formula], [\eqref=ineqpksub] cannot be satisfied for large k. We conclude that K0  <    ∞  .

The second intermediate step

Fix ε0 > 0. Suppose for some scale [formula] and 0 < ε  ≤  ε0 we have

[formula]

Then, if [formula] is sufficiently large, for [formula] we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

We let BN, SN and EN as in the proof of Lemma [\ref=indumsa3]. We proceed as in the proof of Lemma [\ref=indumsa3]. Using [\eqref=hypmsaind3two], [\eqref=covernum] and the fact that events on disjoint boxes are independent, we have

[formula]

if [formula] and [formula] is sufficiently large. For this reason we take

[formula]

Also, using [\eqref=problssub] and [\eqref=cFN], we have,

[formula]

for sufficiently large L, since [formula] and ζ  <  β. Combining [\eqref=probbsubtwo] and [\eqref=probssubtwo], we conclude that

[formula]

To finish the proof we need to show that for all ω∈EN the box ΛL is m0-localizing for Hε,ω, where m0 is given in [\eqref=m000]. Following the proof of Lemma [\ref=indumsa3], we get [formula] and obtain an eigensystem {(ψx,λx)}x∈ΛL for HΛL. To finish the proof we need to show that {(ψx,λx)}x∈ΛL is an m0-localized eigensystem for ΛL. We proceed as in the proof of Lemma [\ref=indumsa3]. We fix x∈ΛL, and take y∈ΛL such that [formula], we have

[formula]

where [formula] is the number of times we used [\eqref=psigoodsub]. Thus, recalling [formula] and using [\eqref=sumdiam], we have

[formula]

for sufficiently large [formula] since [formula]. It follows from [\eqref=repeatdecsub],

[formula]

for sufficiently large [formula].

We conclude that {(ψx,λx)}x∈ΛL is an m0-localized eigensystem for ΛL, where m0 is given in [\eqref=m000], so the box ΛL is m0-localizing for Hε,ω.

The fourth multiscale analysis

Fix ε0 > 0. There exists a finite scale L(ε0) with the following property: Suppose for some scale L0  ≥  L(ε0), 0 < ε  ≤  ε0, and m0  ≥  L-  κ0, where 0 < κ  <  τ  -  γβ, we have

[formula]

Then, setting Lk + 1 = Lγk for [formula], we have

[formula]

Moreover, we have

[formula]

Fix ε0 > 0. Suppose for some scale [formula], 0 < ε  ≤  ε0, and [formula], where 0 < κ  <  τ  -  γβ, we have

[formula]

Then, if [formula] is sufficiently large, for [formula] we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

Lemma [\eqref=indumsa4] and Proposition [\eqref=propmsa4] follow from [\cite=EK], [\cite=EK], and [\cite=EK]. (Note that in [\cite=EK], they assume m  ≥  m- for a fixed m-. However, all the results still hold when [formula]. (See the Lemmas for [formula] being LOC in Sections [\ref=sectlem] and [\ref=sectbuff].))

The proof of the bootstrap multiscale analysis

To prove Theorem [\ref=mainthm], first we assume [\eqref=resmain], which is the same as [\eqref=initcon] with letting Y = 400, for some length scales. We apply Proposition [\ref=propmsa1], obtaining a sequence of length scales satisfying [\eqref=res1]. Therefore [\eqref=hypmsaindone] is satisfied for some length scales. Applying Proposition [\ref=indumsa1one], we get a length scale satisfying [\eqref=resone]. It follows that [\eqref=initcon2] is satisfied since [formula]. We apply Proposition [\ref=propmsa2], obtaining a sequence of length scales satisfying [\eqref=res2]. Therefore, In view of Remark [\ref=rmk1], [\eqref=initcon3] is satisfied with letting [formula]. We apply Proposition [\ref=propmsa3], obtaining a sequence of length scales satisfying [\eqref=res3]. Therefore [\eqref=hypmsaind3two] is satisfied for some length scales. Applying Proposition [\ref=indumsa3two], we get a length scale satisfying [\eqref=restwo]. It follows that [\eqref=initcon4] is satisfied since [formula]. We apply Proposition [\ref=propmsa4], getting [\eqref=res4], so [\eqref=resmain] holds.

The initial step for the bootstrap multiscale analysis

Theorem [\ref=maincor] is an immediate consequence of Theorem [\ref=mainthm] and Proposition [\ref=propinit].

Given [formula] and ε > 0, set

[formula]

Then

[formula]

In particular, given θ > 0 and P0 > 0, there exists a finite scale L(q,θ,P0) such that for all L  ≥  L(q,θ,P0) and [formula] we have

[formula]

Proposition [\ref=propinit] shows that the starting hypothesis for the bootstrap multiscale analysis of Theorem [\ref=mainthm] can be fulfilled .

To prove Proposition [\ref=propinit], we will use the following lemma given in [\cite=EK].

Let Hε =  - εΔ + V on [formula], where V is a bounded potential and ε > 0. Let [formula], and suppose there is η > 0 such that

[formula]

Then for [formula] the operator Hε,Θ has an eigensystem {(ψx,λx)}x∈Θ such that

[formula]

and for all y∈Θ we have

[formula]

Let ε > 0 and ΛL  =  ΛL(x0) for some [formula]. Let η = 4dε + L- q and suppose

[formula]

It follows from Lemma [\ref=leminit] that Hε,ΛL has an eigensystem {(ψx,λx)}x∈ΛL satisfying [\eqref=lambdadif] and [\eqref=initdec]. We conclude from [\eqref=lambdadif] that ΛL is polynomially level spacing for Hε. Moreover, using [\eqref=initdec] and [formula], for all y,x∈ΛL with [formula] we have

[formula]

with θε,L as in [\eqref=thetaprop]. Therefore ΛL(x) is θ-polynomially localizing.

We have

[formula]

which yields [\eqref=probploc1]. (We assumed [formula]; if not [\eqref=probploc1] holds trivially.)

If [formula], for sufficiently large L we have θε,L  ≥  θ, and

[formula]

since αq - 2d > 0.
