Distributed Hybridization Model for Quantum Critical Behavior in Magnetic Quasicrystals

Quasicrystals, which were discovered in 1984 by Shechtman et al. [\cite=Shechtman84], constitute a unique class of crystals. Because of the absence of translational symmetry, the Bloch theorem is not applicable. Theoretical investigations on electronic properties so far revealed, e.g., existence of a universal pseudogap from electronic structure calculations [\cite=Fujiwara91], and existence of confined states from model calculations [\cite=Kohmoto86] [\cite=tsunetsugu86] [\cite=Fujiwara88].

An interesting magnetic properties were found recently by Deguchi et al. in a Tsai-type quasicrystal with ytterbium atoms Au51Al34Yb15 [\cite=Deguchi12]. The susceptibility at [formula] K shows the Curie law with the effective magnetic moment μeff  ≈  3.9μB, indicating a major contribution from 4f13 configurations of Yb3 + ions. The susceptibility continues to increase down to T = 0.1 K in proportion to [formula] with γ  ≈  0.5, but no phase transition has been observed. The specific heat C also exhibits an anomalous T-dependence, C / T  ~    -   log T. Interestingly, no divergences of χ and C / T were observed in an approximant crystal Au51Al35Yb14, which consists of the same local structure but has periodicity. It strongly indicates that the lack of periodicity plays a key role in the observed "quantum critical" behaviors. Furthermore, robustness of the low-temperature properties against the external pressure confirms the distinction from the ordinary quantum critical phenomena due to magnetic long-range ordering. Motivated by these observations, correlation effects in quasiperiodic lattices were investigated theoretically [\cite=Watanabe13] [\cite=Takemori14] [\cite=Takemura15] [\cite=Shinzaki16].

The f-electron valence of Yb ions was determined by an X-ray absorption measurement [\cite=Watanuki12] [\cite=Matsukawa14]. It reported a mean valence of 2.61, meaning that magnetic Yb3 + ions having 4f13 configuration and nonmagnetic Yb2 + ions are mixed. The mixed-valence state is, in naive picture, incompatible with the magnetic anomaly. It invokes discussions in terms of valence fluctuations to connect the mixed-valence state with the anomalous magnetic properties[\cite=Watanabe16], although no direct evidence of valence fluctuations has been reported yet.

In this Letter, we address the contradictory magnetic and mixed-valence properties from another point of view, namely, the Kondo screening in quasicrystals without periodicity. Strictly speaking, there are no equivalent sites in a crystallographic sense. It means that environment of 4f electrons in Yb ions, e.g., the number of neighboring Au/Al atoms and distances to them, are different from site to site. This situation may be described by site-dependent local parameters, such as hybridization strength Vi between f and conduction electrons. In this perspective, a distribution of Vi (or V2i) is the key quantity that distinguishes quasicrystals from ordinary periodic materials as well as their approximants. We expect a continuous distribution in quasicrystals, while it consists of only a single or finite number of delta functions in periodic and approximant crystals. Figure [\ref=fig:hyb_prob] schematically represents various kinds of distributions of V2i.

If the spatial arrangement of Vi is neglected, electronic properties are determined essentially by the distribution function P(V2i) only. More specifically, V2i may be randomly distributed according to the probability distribution P(V2i). Such a model is known as the Kondo disorder model, which was discussed in the context of "quantum critical" behaviors observed in heavy-fermion alloys with considerable disorder [\cite=Bernal95] [\cite=Miranda96] [\cite=Miranda97]. The above circumstances suggest that the Kondo-disorder scenario is also applicable to the quasicrystals without disorder. In other words, if relevant electrons feel essentially local environments, which differ from site to site, in quasicrystals, quasiperiodicity cannot be distinguished from randomly distributed local environments. This scenario was recently proposed by Andrade et al.[\cite=Andrade15] They computed the site dependence of hybridization strength on a model quasiperiodic lattice [\cite=footnote-Andrade] and demonstrated correspondence with the Kondo disorder picture. Nevertheless, further numerical investigations are required to elucidate valence properties as well as explicit temperature variation of physical quantities of interest. This is the aim of this Letter.

We consider an Anderson lattice model with site-dependent hybridization. Using a hole picture, we represent 4f13 (4f14) configurations of Yb3 + (Yb2 +) ions as f1 (f0) state. The Hamiltonian reads

[formula]

where n̂fiα  =  f†iαfiα and the f states have N-fold degeneracy labeled by α [\cite=footnote-N6]. Considering the limit U =   ∞  , we restrict the local f states to f0 and f1 configurations.

As described above, the hybridization strength Vi is treated as a random variable distributed according to the probability P(V2i). We expect a continuous distribution for V2i in quasicrystals. For simplicity, we consider a uniform distribution of width 2δV2:

[formula]

In Eq. ([\ref=eq:H]), not only Vi but εfi could also be site dependent in quasiperiodic structures. However, since it is the quantity V2i / |εfi| that is essential in the Kondo physics, εfi may be fixed for the present purpose.

Let us first make a simple consideration on the consequences of the hybridization distribution. If we consider the f electron on each site independently, the site-dependence of V2i may be regarded as a site-dependence of the Kondo temperature TK,i. The continuous distribution of V2i is thus read as a distribution of TK,i. Suppose that the lowest value of TK,i is so small that the ground state is inaccessible practically, unscreened f moments exist in the whole temperature range, giving rise to the Curie-like divergent behavior of the low-temperature magnetic susceptibility. However, since local susceptibilities with different values of TK,i should be integrated, its T dependence is nontrivial. We shall derive explicit temperature dependence of the susceptibility by solving the model ([\ref=eq:H]) numerically.

We treat the random distribution of V2i with the coherent potential approximation (CPA) [\cite=Yonezawa73] [\cite=Elliott74] and the many-body effects with the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) [\cite=Georges96]. The CPA+DMFT scheme has been applied to a wide range of correlated models [\cite=Byczuk05] [\cite=Byczuk09]. Regarding the Kondo systems, evolution from the dilute Kondo systems to coherent heavy-fermion systems were discussed [\cite=Shiina95] [\cite=Mutou01] [\cite=Burdin07] [\cite=Grenzebach08] [\cite=Otsuki10]. Those calculations correspond to substitution of rare-earth atoms with nonmagnetic ions like lanthanum. In contrast, a distribution of hybridization we are considering here corresponds to disorder on conduction electrons. A similar situation was discussed by Miranda et al. [\cite=Miranda96] [\cite=Miranda97] in the context of the Kondo disorder.

A brief description on the CPA+DMFT scheme is presented in the following. In the CPA, we take a random average over spatial configurations of V2i for a given probability distribution P(V2i). Because of the average, the translational symmetry is recovered for conduction electrons. The Green function [formula] of conduction electrons is thus given by

[formula]

Here, ω is the fermionic Matsubara frequencies. The CPA self-energy ΣCPA(iω) is evaluated with the help of auxiliary impurity models [\cite=Georges96]. Since Vi is now site-dependent, the impurity models are defined for each site. The hybridization function is given by Δi(iω) = V2iG0(iω) with G0(iω) being the so-called cavity Green function defined by

[formula]

where [formula] means the momentum average. Together with εf and U =   ∞  , we solve the effective Anderson model and evaluate the local Green function Gfi(iω) of f electrons, which is site dependent. In our calculations, we use the hybridization-expansion solver[\cite=Werner06a] of the continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo method [\cite=Rubtsov05] [\cite=Gull11]. Gfi(iω) is then connected to [formula] by the self-consistency condition [formula]. Here, [formula] is the t-matrix averaged with respect to P(V2i)

[formula]

Combined with Eq. ([\ref=eq:G-cav]), we obtain the formula for ΣCPA:

[formula]

Eqs. ([\ref=eq:Gc])-([\ref=eq:sigma]) are solved by numerical iterations. The integral in Eq. ([\ref=eq:V-ave]) is evaluated using the trapezoidal rule with NV = 100 stripes. It means that we solve the impurity model (NV + 1) times in each iteration.

Details of our numerical calculations are given as follows. The density of states of conduction electrons is set as constant [formula] for |ε| < D for simplicity. We fix parameters εf =  - 0.5 and [formula] in the unit of D = 1. Remaining parameters are δV2 and T. The chemical potential μ is adjusted so that the average total electron number per site per orbital is fixed at n / N = 0.6. The conduction band turned out to be almost half filling, nc / N≃0.5, for parameters used in this paper. The Kondo temperature TK in the case with δV2 = 0 is estimated from the expression TK = D exp [  -  |εf|  /  (NV2ρ0)] as TK  ≈  0.19.

We show numerical results for the magnetic susceptibility. The bulk susceptibility is computed by averaging the local susceptibility χfi of f electrons with respect to P(V2i)

[formula]

Figure [\ref=fig:chi-1] shows T dependence of [formula] for several values of the width of the distribution, δV2. Here, we set the Curie constant of Yb3 + ions as unity. The data for δV2 = 0 corresponds to the ordinary Anderson lattice model, and it shows the crossover from the Curie law [formula] for [formula] to the renormalized paramagnetic Kondo state for T  ≪  TK. As δV2 increases, the low-temperature dependence changes from renormalized paramagnetic to divergent behavior. For [formula], [formula] exhibits a power-law-like behavior χ  ~  T-  γ with the exponent γ different from the Curie law: γ  ≈  0.42 and 0.60 for δV2 = 0.08 and 0.09, respectively.

Let us see why the nontrivial exponents appear in the bulk magnetic susceptibility [formula]. To this end, we show site-resolved susceptibilities χfi for δV2 = 0.09 in Fig. [\ref=fig:chi-site-resolved]. There are NV + 1 = 101 lines plotted from V2i = 0.01 to 0.19. At weakly hybridizing sites, χfi follows the Curie law 1 / T down to T = 10- 3, while as V2i increases, the Kondo behavior is recovered. Integrating these various curves turns out to yield the power-law-like behavior with the nontrivial exponent. As is clear from this explanation, the exponent γ is not universal since the apparent critical behavior is not due to a critical phenomena as in the 2nd-order phase transition. It is also obvious that the divergence is slower than the Curie law, namely, γ  ≤  1, and practically [formula] in the case with the flat distribution of P(V2i).

We present below detailed analysis of site-dependence of local quantities. In Fig. [\ref=fig:V_dep](a), χfi in Fig. [\ref=fig:chi-site-resolved] is replotted as a function of V2i for several values of T. A significant T dependence appears in the limited region with [formula], indicating that only a part of sites govern the low-temperature behavior of the bulk susceptibility [formula]. The f-electron number nfi is close to 1 (Yb3 +) at these sites as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:V_dep](b). On the other hand, strongly hybridizing sites with [formula] are mixed-valence with nfi  ≈  0.6 (Yb2.6 +). The f-electron valence of Yb ions is thus site dependent. A distribution ρ(nfi) of the valence may be evaluated from the data for nfi by the formula

[formula]

It turns out from Fig. [\ref=fig:histogram] that the distribution ρ(nfi) becomes considerably wider as T decreases, and interestingly, it is peaked at both edges. The spread distribution on the side of nfi = 1 indicates the existence of well-defined localized magnetic moments. However, since the number of those unscreened moments is an order of magnitude smaller than that of the mixed-valence sites on the other side of the distribution, the average f-electron number [formula] for the bulk inherits the mixed-valence feature as shown in the inset of Fig. [\ref=fig:histogram].

Here, we make a comment on the ground state of the present model. Although a power-law-like behavior of the magnetic susceptibility was observed, it should finally saturate at [formula]. The point is that the characteristic energy scale is so small that we cannot reach the ground state in practice. In fact, the Kondo temperature at the site with the smallest hybridization V min = 0.01 is estimated as TK,min  ≈  6  ×  10- 8, which is much lower than our lowest temperature T = 10- 3.

In summary, we clarified the magnetic and valence properties of Yb ions, assuming the site-dependent hybridization that is randomly and continuously distributed. When the distribution is wide enough, even though the most Yb ions are in the Kondo or mixed-valence regimes, there exist a small number of unscreened magnetic moments, which give the dominant contribution to the bulk susceptibility. Because of the continuous distribution of V2i as an intrinsic feature of quasicrystals, the averaged magnetic susceptibility exhibits a nontrivial temperature dependence having weaker power-law-like behavior than the Curie law. The present model therefore shows both the "quantum critical" behavior and the mixed-valence feature observed in the Yb quasicrystal. It is important to note that in our model any (quantum) phase transitions including critical valence fluctuations are unnecessary behind the observed peculiar magnetic properties with intermediate valence. Thus, the pressure effect of our scenario should be different from those based on quantum critical phenomena, since ours does not depend on the "distance" from a quantum critical point but on nature of the distribution of the hybridization strength.

In the present scenario, the existence of unscreened magnetic moments on the weakly hybridizing sites is essential. Experimentally, one can check validity of the scenario if a site-selective measurement could be done. Moreover, at fundamental level of describing a model for quasicrystals, it is important to evaluate whether the appearance of the weakly hybridizing sites are intrinsic in quasiperiodic structures. In particular, it is interesting if almost isolated sites appear where f-electron moments remain unscreened. In this way, since the quasiperiodicity could play a hidden role for the "quantum critical" behavior in Yb quasicrystals, further investigations on pressure effect and by means of local probes are highly desired.
