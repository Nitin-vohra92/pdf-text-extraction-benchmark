Introduction

In worst-case optimization problems one has two sets X,Y of admissible choices and a cost functional [formula]; the goal is to minimize F over X when the worst choice with respect to Y occurs. In other words, we consider the optimization problem

[formula]

where the cost functional F is defined by

[formula]

For a clear and extended presentation of worst-case optimization problems in structural mechanics we refer to [\cite=all14].

In the present paper we consider a worst-case shape optimization problem for elliptic PDEs with Dirichlet boundary conditions. More precisely, we fix a bounded domain [formula] and for every domain Ω  ⊂  D and f∈L2(D) we consider the state function u, solution of the PDE

[formula]

and a cost functional of the form

[formula]

where [formula] is a decreasing function in the second variable. If we assume that the right-hand side f may vary under an unknown small perturbation, we obtain the worst-case shape functional

[formula]

where δ > 0 is a fixed real number. In Theorem [\ref=excontr] we show that for small δ, there exists a solution to the shape optimization problem

[formula]

where we indicate by |  ·  | the Lebesgue measure in [formula].

Of particular interest is the case when [formula], when the cost functional F(Ω,f) becomes the Dirichlet energy

[formula]

and we denote by E the corresponding worst-case functional. We discuss this case in Section [\ref=sexis] since the specificity of the functional allows us to obtain the existence of an optimal domain by applying some classical results of [\cite=bdm93] for decreasing shape functionals. In Section [\ref=sradial] we consider the case f = constant or more generally f(x) = (|x|) with (r) decreasing; we show (see Theorem [\ref=trad]) that in this situation, if D is large enough, the solution of the worst-case shape optimization problem

[formula]

is actually a ball of measure m.

The last Section [\ref=snumer] contains some numerical computations on a particular example.

Capacity, quasi-open sets and capacitary measures

Here below we summarize the main tools that we use in the sequel; the interested reader can find a more detailed presentation of them in [\cite=bubu05].

Capacity and Sobolev functions. We define the capacity of a set [formula] as

[formula]

A classical result gives that the Sobolev functions are defined up to a set of zero capacity. In fact, we have that for every [formula] the set of Lebesgue points

[formula]

is such that [formula]. Thus, we can identify a Sobolev function with its equivalence class with respect to the relation u  ~  v, iff [formula].

Quasi-open sets and Sobolev spaces. We say that the set [formula] is quasi-open if for every ε > 0 there is an open set [formula] such that [formula] and [formula] is open. Given a quasi-open set [formula] we define the Sobolev space H10(Ω) as

[formula]

and we notice that this definition coincides with the usual one in the case when Ω is open. For every quasi-open set Ω, the Sobolev space H10(Ω) is a closed subspace of [formula] with respect to the Sobolev norm

[formula]

PDEs on quasi-open sets. For a quasi-open set [formula] and a function f∈L2(Ω) we say that u is a solution of the PDE

[formula]

if we have that u∈H10(Ω) and

[formula]

It is well-known that u∈H10(Ω) is a solution of [\eqref=pdeufo] if and only if it minimizes in H10(Ω) the functional

[formula]

In this framework the maximum principle states that if f > 0, then {u > 0}  =  Ω up to a set of zero capacity. Thus, we can identify any quasi-open set Ω of finite measure with the level set {wØ > 0} where wØ is the solution of

[formula]

In particular, we can endow the family of all quasi-open subsets of D with the metric

[formula]

Capacitary measures. We say that a positive measure μ is of a capacitary type if μ(E) = 0 for every set [formula] such that [formula]. Since every [formula] is defined up to a set of zero capacity, we have that the integral [formula] is well-defined (finite or infinite). We define the Sobolev space H1μ as

[formula]

Notice that if Ω is a quasi-open set, then H10(Ω) = H1μØ, where the capacitary measure μØ is defined as

[formula]

PDEs involving capacitary measures. For a capacitary measure μ and a function [formula] we say that u is a solution to the PDE

[formula]

if we have that u∈H1μ and

[formula]

As in the classical case we have that u is a solution of [\eqref=mupde] if and only if u minimizes in H1μ the functional

[formula]

Moreover we have the following maximum principle: If μ1  ≥  μ2 (which means that μ1(E)  ≥  μ2(E) for every quasi-open set E) and f1  ≤  f2, then u1  ≤  u2, where ui is the solution of

[formula]

The metric space of capacitary measures. Suppose that [formula] is an open set of finite measure. We denote by QO(D) the metric space of quasi-open subsets of D endowed with the metric [\eqref=metric]. Then the completion of QO(D) with respect to dγ is given by the set

[formula]

with the metric

[formula]

where wμ denotes the solution of

[formula]

it was proved in [\cite=dmmo87] that [formula] is a compact metric space.

Continuous functionals on [formula]. The resolvent operator is continuous with respect to the metric above, in fact if fn∈L2(D) is a sequence converging in L2(D) to f∞∈L2(D) and μn is a sequence of capacitary measures converging to [formula] in the dγ distance then the sequence of solutions un of the PDEs

[formula]

converges strongly in L2(D) to the solution of

[formula]

Thus, all the functionals of the form

[formula]

where [formula] is a given function, and u is the solution of

[formula]

are lower semi-continuous with respect to dγ, provided j(x,s) is continuous with respect to s and bounded from below as

[formula]

Existence of optimal sets. The following result was proved in [\cite=bdm93] and represents the main tool for proving existence of optimal domains.

Dirichlet energy of quasi-open sets and capacitary measures. Suppose that [formula] is a quasi-open set and f∈L2(D). For a quasi-open set of finite measure [formula] we define the Dirichlet energy of Ω with respect to f as

[formula]

where the functional J(Ω,u,f) is defined in [\eqref=dirfunct]. The minimizer u solves [\eqref=pdeufo]. Thus multiplying both sides of [\eqref=pdeufo] by u and integrating by parts, we get

[formula]

For a capacitary measure [formula] we have

[formula]

where J(μ,u,f) is the functional in [\eqref=jmu], and again by integration by parts we get

[formula]

Optimal domains for worst-case energy functionals

We consider a fixed bounded domain [formula] and a function f∈Lp(D), where p∈[2d  /  (d  +  2),  +     ∞ ] (p > 1 if d = 2). For every quasi-open set Ω  ⊂  D we define the worst-case shape functional

[formula]

where δ > 0 is a given number.

For every quasi open set [formula] of finite measure and f∈Lp(Ω), for p as above, we have

[formula]

The supremum in [\eqref=wcfunct] is attained for the function

[formula]

where p' is the conjugate exponent of p and u is the minimizer of the right hand side of [\eqref=wcfunct2].

We first show that the supremum in [\eqref=wcfunct] is attained. Let gn be a maximizing sequence in [\eqref=wcfunct]; since [formula] we may assume, up to extracting a subsequence, that gn converges weakly to some g in Lp(D). The solutions un of

[formula]

then converge, weakly in H10(Ω), to the solution u of

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

Since gn is a maximizing sequence, we get the claim.

The expression of Eδ,p is of sup -inf  type and to the functional J the sup -inf  switch can be applied (see for instance [\cite=cla77]). The supremum of J(Ω,u,f + g) with respect to g is easy to compute and is reached for

[formula]

where p' is the conjugate exponent of p; we have then

[formula]

Note that, when p =   ∞  , the functional Eδ,  ∞ reduces to

[formula]

and the analysis above still holds.

We will prove that the functional Eδ,p satisfies the hypotheses of Theorem [\ref=teobudm]. By using the inclusion of Sobolev spaces H10(Ω1)  ⊂  H10(Ω2) whenever Ω1  ⊂  Ω2 and the expression [\eqref=wcfunct2] we obtain that the mapping Ω  ↦  Eδ,p(Ω) is decreasing with respect to the set inclusion. Thus it is sufficient to prove that the shape functional Eδ,p is lower semicontinuous with respect to the γ-convergence. Suppose that Ωn is a sequence of quasi-open sets in D γ-converging to the quasi-open set [formula]. For every open set Ωn let gn∈Lp(D) be the function such that

[formula]

Up to a subsequence, we may suppose that gn converges weakly in Lp(D) to a function g∈Lp(D) which is such that [formula]. By the γ-convergence of Ωn we get that the solution un of the equation

[formula]

converges strongly in H10(D) to the solution of

[formula]

Thus, we have that

[formula]

which concludes the proof.

The radial case

In this section we consider the case of a right-hand side f of radial type; more precisely, we assume that f = f(|x|) and that the function r  ↦  f(r) is decreasing. We then consider the worst-case shape optimization problem [\eqref=wcshopt] where the cost functional Eδ,p is given, according to Proposition [\ref=infsup], by

[formula]

We also assume that the domain D is large enough to contain a ball of measure m. With the assumptions above we have the following result.

The worst case shape optimization problem [\eqref=wcshopt] is solved by the ball of measure m centered at the origin.

The proof is obtained by symmetrization. It is known that the rearrangement of Ω into the ball Ω* centered at the origin and u into a radial decreasing function u* gives a lower Dirichlet integral

[formula]

and the same Lp' norm

[formula]

while, due to the monotonicity assumption on f and the Riesz inequality (see [\cite=liebloss]), the linear term [formula] increases :

[formula]

Therefore, we obtain that the ball [formula] satisfies

[formula]

which concludes the proof.

Optimal domains for linear worst-case functionals

In this section we consider a more general form of the optimization problem of the previous sections, presented in the form of an optimal control problem, where the control variable is the domain Ω  ⊂  D in the bounded open set [formula].

The worst-case cost functional. For a quasi-open set [formula] we consider the state equation

[formula]

where f∈Lp(D) is a given fixed non-negative function and [formula] (p > 1, if d = 2). The cost functional is then

[formula]

where

[formula]

where [formula] (q > 1, if d = 2). Note that, when h = f we are in the situation of Section [\ref=sexis]. We assume that the right-hand side f may vary under an unknown perturbation, i.e. we consider the worst-case shape functional

[formula]

Let [formula] be a quasi-open set of finite measure, f∈Lp(Ω) and h∈Lq(Ω), where p and q are as above. Then

[formula]

where w is the solution of

[formula]

Let g∈Lp(Ω) be such that [formula] and u be the solution of

[formula]

Then after integrating by parts we have

[formula]

with an equality achieved for

[formula]

which concludes the proof.

The shape optimization problem. We now consider the shape optimization problem

[formula]

where m > 0 and Fδ,p(Ω) is the functional from [\eqref=mathcalFexpression]. We notice that Fδ,p is not necessarily decreasing and so, we cannot apply Theorem [\ref=teobudm] in order to obtain that an optimal domain exists.

Let Ωn be a minimizing sequence for [\eqref=wcsopmain]. By wn we denote the solution of

[formula]

We may assume that Ωn converges in the dγ distance to the capacitary measure [formula]. By the properties of the γ-convergence we have that wn converges strongly in L2(D) and weakly in H10(D) to the function wμ, solution of

[formula]

and so, setting

[formula]

we get

[formula]

We now consider the quasi-open set Ω  =  {wμ > 0}. By the pointwise almost everywhere convergence of wn to wμ we have that

[formula]

Thus, in order to prove that the set Ω is a solution of [\eqref=wcsopmain], it is sufficient to prove that Fδ,p(Ω)  ≤  Fδ,p(μ). We notice that by the maximum principle we have wμ  ≤  wØ, so that

[formula]

where in the last line we set [formula], being [formula] is the solution of

[formula]

and we used that by the maximum principle we have [formula] and that [formula] is bounded. Thus we have

[formula]

Our next step is to prove that the right-hand side of [\eqref=6875786] is negative for δ small enough. Let [formula] be a fixed quasi-open set with |Dm| = m and take δ small enough, depending on Dm, h, f, and p, to have Fδ,p(Dm) < 0; taking into account the definition of Fδ,p in [\eqref=mathcalFexpression] this is always possible. Thus for δ small enough, there is a constant  > 0 depending only on p, h, f and D such that

[formula]

In particular, we have Fδ,p(μ)  ≤    -   < 0. Then

[formula]

and we can estimate from below the norm of wμ as follows:

[formula]

Substituting in [\eqref=6875786] we get

[formula]

Since f is bounded from below we obtain that, choosing  > 0 small enough, depending on D, f, h, m and p, for δ  ≤   we have [formula], which proves the claim.

A numerical example

This section is devoted to some numerical simulations of optimal solutions for the worst-case functional. We focus on the worst-case functional Eδ,p given in ([\ref=wcfunct2]) for the case p = 2. In order to set a numerical algorithm for simulating the optimal shapes we work with the optimal control formulation, as in the previous section. Obtaining the Euler-Lagrange equation of the worst-case functional Eδ,2 it is elementary to check that the problem

[formula]

is equivalent to

[formula]

where

[formula]

and u the solution of the state equation

[formula]

Remark that both, the cost functional and the state equation, are now nonlinear. Of course, when δ = 0 we recover the original shape optimization problem for compliance. For the numerical simulations of optimal solutions we work with the generalized (relaxed) formulation of the problem (see [\cite=bdm91]), or more concretely with an approximation of it introduced in [\cite=bgrv14],

[formula]

where [formula] stands for the functional

[formula]

being u the solution of the PDE

[formula]

and B(Ω) the class of nonnegative Borel measurable functions on Ω. The constraint

[formula]

plays the role of the volume constraint in the original problem. In [\cite=bgrv14] it is shown that when α goes to zero this problem Γ-converges to the relaxed formulation of the problem given in [\cite=bdm91]. In general, if an optimal shape Ω exists, then there is an optimal potential V such that, a.e. x∈Ω,

[formula]

Our simulations are performed in FreeFEM++ using the Method of Moving Asymptotes as the optimizing routing (available in FreeFEM++ through the NLopt library). Method of Moving Asymptotes is a gradient based method widely used for Topology and Structural Optimization problems [\cite=svanberg]. The nonlinear state and adjoint equations are solved with a simple iterative algorithm in which the nonlinear term is updated with the state of the previous iteration. In our numerical examples we take D = (0,1)  ×  (0,1) and a regular mesh of 50  ×  50 elements. For the numerical practice it is advisable to constraint V to take vales on a bounded interval
