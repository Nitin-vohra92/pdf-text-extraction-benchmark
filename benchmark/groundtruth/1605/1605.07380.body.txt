Elasticity of a semiflexible filament with a discontinuous tension due to a cross-link or a molecular motor

Introduction

Over the past couple of decades, it has become clear that mechanics plays a very important role in the biological function of the cell, on a par with biochemistry [\cite=Discher_Cell2006] [\cite=Butcher_cancer_Nature2009] [\cite=Ingber_Mechanics_Development2010]. In order to unravel the physical basis of the complex mechanical behaviour of biological matter, a bottom-up strategy has proven very fruitful [\cite=bausch2006bottom]. In this approach, the basic functional modules of the cytoskeleton are reconstituted in vitro and analysed experimentally in tandem with theoretical modelling.

The basic structural elements of the cytoskeleton (microtubules, intermediate filaments, F-actin) are all semiflexible polymers with a behaviour intermediate between that of a random coil and a rigid rod [\cite=Terentjev_SM_review] [\cite=Broedersz_MacKintosh_RMP]. They form supramolecular assemblies (e.g. networks, bundles) through cross-linking [\cite=Bausch_Claessens_SM_review]. Cross-linking involves a host of different filament-binding proteins [\cite=Ayscough_ABPs] [\cite=Mandelkow_MAPs]. Active processes in the cell, such as the delivery of cargos, transport of organelles, mitotic dynamics, as well as muscle contraction are carried out by molecular motors using actin filaments or microtubules as tracks. The bottom-up approach to the study of molecular motors aims at analysing the transduction of metabolic energy into mechanical force and motion at the microscopic level using in vitro assays [\cite=Veigel_Schmidt_NR2011]. The advances in single-molecule manipulation are harnessed to study the simplest motor-filament complexes. In gliding assays, the motor (myosin, kinesin, or dynein) is attached to a glass surface and the translocation of the filament (F-actin or microtubule) is observed. In single motor assays, the filament is attached to the glass surface and the movement of the motor is monitored. In motor assays with beads, the motor is attached to a micron-sized refractile bead whose position is measured [\cite=Holzbaur_Goldman_2010].

In this paper, we investigate analytically the mechanical response of a semiflexible filament with a tension discontinuity. Our model system can be viewed as one of the simplest structural elements of the cytoskeleton beyond the isolated single-molecule level. We consider a semiflexible polymer, modelled as a wormlike chain, in the weakly bending approximation. The latter can be satisfied either by applying a strong tensile force which irons out large thermal undulations, or by having a filament with large persistence length compared to its contour length. A longitudinal Hookean spring whose one end is attached to a fixed substrate, has its other end on the filament thus exerting a force which causes the tension discontinuity. The position of one end of the filament is held fixed, whereas that of the other end fluctuates. Its average position yields the force-extension relations which are the main subject of our analysis. The spring may be viewed as representing a motor, according to the myosin cross-bridge model first introduced by Huxley in 1957 [\cite=Huxley_1957] and still in use [\cite=Guerin_Prost_Martin_Joanny]. Our results apply to passive motors or to very slowly stepping motors, slower than the relaxation time of the filament. The time scale can be tuned by adjusting the concentration of ATP molecules. We should point out, however, that our study of semiflexible filaments with tension discontinuity is also relevant to passive cross-linkers of large size or compliance. Many of the actin binding proteins fall in this category as they can have large spacer domains [\cite=Bausch_Claessens_SM_review]

Our paper is organised as follows. In Sec. II we introduce the model and show how the discontinuity along the filament contour arises. In Sec. III we discuss the method of Green functions which allows us to calculate correlation functions of the filament tangent vector and therefore the force-extension relation for different boundary conditions. Explicit results for the case of small spring force, large spring force, and large spring and external forces with a small difference between them are given in Sec. IV. In Sec. V we discuss the relation of our analysis to single motor experiments. We conclude in Sec. VI, and details of our calculations are given in the Appendices.

Model description

Our starting point is the wormlike chain model for a semiflexible filament of contour length L which is attached to a point or wall on one side and pulled by a constant force, [formula], on the other side. Its Hamiltonian is given by

[formula]

Here [formula] is the tangent vector at arclength s,0  ≤  s  ≤  L and κ denotes the bending stiffness. We will treat the above model in the weakly bending approximation [\cite=Marko_Siggia], assuming that the persistence length lp  =  κ / (kBT) is much larger than the length L of the filament.

In the Monge parametrization [\cite=PhysRevE.74.041803], the tangent of a semiflexible filament is given by [formula]. We assume that the filament is oriented along the x-direction, either due to the grafting on the left side and/or the pulling force [formula]. In the weakly bending limit the transverse components of the tangent vector a1(s) and a2(s) are small. We therefore approximate [formula] and [formula] where the dot denotes the derivative with respect to s. The Hamiltonan then reads

[formula]

Here, we are interested in the effects of a motor whose one end is grafted to a substrate while the other end is attached to the filament at arclength Lm. In the simplest model, the motor is just a spring of rest length L0. and spring constant km

[formula]

When the motor steps along the filament, its effective spring is compressed or extended beyond the rest length, resulting in a force, fm on the filament. Since the pulling force, fext, is fixed the presence of the motor will result in a compression or extension of the filament. In this paper, we compute the change in the force-extension relation of the filament due to the attached motor.

In the weakly bending approximation, we can represent the total Hamiltonian H = HWB + Hspring in the form of a filament with an arclength dependent tension:

[formula]

where f(s) is a piecewise constant function

[formula]

with fm = km(X0 - Lm + L0).

Actually the assumtion of a harmonic spring for the motor is not needed as long as we use the weakly bending approximation. Consider a general interaction potential instead V(R1). In the weakly bending approximation, we take

[formula]

to be small, and expand V around R1 = Lm

[formula]

resulting in the same effective Hamiltonian (Eq.[\ref=Hamiltonian]), but now for a general interaction potential.

We want to compute the end-to-end distance of the filament 〈R〉  =  〈x(L) - x(0)〉. To that end, we first calculate

[formula]

and similarly [formula], where the thermal average 〈...〉 is to be taken with the Hamiltonian of Eq.([\ref=Hamiltonian]).

Solution using Green function

Using integration by parts for the first term in Eq. ([\ref=Hamiltonian]) we find:

[formula]

where [formula] depends on the boundary conditions and is a constant and [formula] is a differential operator. The corresponding Green function obeys the differential equation

[formula]

For a piecewise constant force f(s) we can solve for the Green function in the two regions with constant force and then match the solutions at s = Lm (see appendix). For the explicit calculation, we have to specify boundary conditions at both ends of the filament. We consider two cases: the clamped-free filament, shown in the upper part and the hinged-hinged filament, shown in the lower part of Fig.[\ref=configurationofthesystem1].

Clamped-free filament

We require [formula] at the free end and ai(0) = 0 at the clamped end. For the Green function this implies

[formula]

The correlation function of the transverse components of the tangent vector can be obtained from the Green function as follows [\cite=hori2007stretching] [\cite=peskin1995introduction]:

[formula]

If no motor is attached, the force-extension relation reads [\cite=PhysRevE.74.041803]:

[formula]

The characteristic energy scale of the WLC is given by κ / L. Hence we have rescaled the externally applied pulling force with the bending force of the wormlike chain and introduced ext = fextL2  /  κ. We get a linear relation for small forces

[formula]

with rest length Lr = L - L2 / 2lp and stiffness [formula] [\cite=PhysRevE.74.041803].

Hinged-hinged filament

In this case we require [formula] and [formula] implying for the Green function

[formula]

Fo a compressive external force fext, the filament is free to rotate at the grafted end. This can be prevented by requiring that the pulling point has to have the same height as the grafting point: [formula]. The correlation function of the components of the tangent vector is then given by[\cite=hori2007stretching] [\cite=peskin1995introduction]:

[formula]

If no motor is attached to the filament, the force-extension is explicitly given by

[formula]

For small forces, the filament behaves like a spring

[formula]

with rest length Lr = L - L2 / (6lp) and a length dependent stiffness [formula]

Results

The explicit analytic solution for the Green function is given in the appendix. As a result we obtain analytic, albeit lengthy expressions for the force extension 〈R〉  =  〈R〉(fext). To better understand these results, we plot the force-extension relations for hinged-hinged boundary conditions in Fig. [\ref=force-extension1]. The effect of the motor force is more pronounced in the compressional regime, fext < 0, because the filament is softer in response to compressions as compared to extensions, fext > 0. The motor force can partially compensate the compression of the fiber by the external force, if its sign is opposite, i.e. it is pulling on the left part of the segment. Obviously, the left segment is then extended as compared to the case without motor (see Fig.[\ref=force-extension2], upper part), but also the right segment is extended (see Fig.[\ref=force-extension2], lower part), even though the tension in the right part does not depend on fm. The reason for this extension is the stronger alignment of the left end of the right part of the filament by the motor. The overall effect of a positive motor force is to substantially stiffen the filament in the compressional regime. The effects of course increase with increasing motor force. If the motor force is compressional the extension of the filament is correspondingly reduced as compared to the case without motor force.

In Fig. [\ref=force-extension3], we show the dependence of the filaments extension on the motor force, fm, for several values of external pulling force, fext. If no external force is applied 〈R〉  =  〈R〉(fm) looks qualitatively similar to 〈R〉  =  〈R〉(fext). The filament is most sensitive to the external pulling force in the range where the motor tends to compress the filament. The effects of the motor are seen best in the differential tensile stiffness of the filament, which can be computed from the force-extension relation according to

[formula]

In Fig. [\ref=diff_stiffness] we show the relative change in the differential stiffness of the filament caused by the spring. There is significant enhancement in stiffness when the spring force is extensile (dashed line), because the effective tension of the filament is increased. The stiffness is weakened for a compressive motor force (full lines). In both cases do we observe stronger effects in the regime where the external force is compressive, implying that a filament under compression is strongly sensitive to a motor which is either pushing or pulling.

Limit of small motor force fm

It is instructive to consider the limit of small motor force [formula]. For the clamped-free case, we find

[formula]

In this limit, the motor-filament system can be represented as a linear elastic element with an effective force constant k that depends on the external pulling force and the point of attachment of the motor. The explicit expression for the force constant is given in the Appendix, and a similar expression can be calculated for the hinged-hinged case. In Fig. [\ref=kconst], we show the force constant k of the motor as a function of the external force fext. The force constant decreases as we compress the filament and it increases as we increase the stretching force. This change of the motor force constant k is an essential feature of the elasticity of the semiflexible filament which is missing in studies using linear elasticity for the filament. In Fig. [\ref=LinearG], we compare the exact force-extension relation to the linearised one. As can be seen in the figure, the linear approximation works better for higher values of the external force fext.

In the limit of large external forces, [formula], and large filament length, min {L,Lm}  ≫  fext / (kBT), Eq. [\ref=small_fm] reduces to the following relation, irrespective of boundary conditions:

[formula]

Notice that this equation holds in the thermodynamic limit and it is scale invariant: if we multiply all lengths ([formula], Lm, L) by the same factor, it does not change. The effect of the motor force is subdominant, as it scales with ~  1 / f3 / 2ext compared to [formula] for the Marko-Siggia case, but it is noteworthy that it persists in the thermodynamic limit and is not just a finite-size effect.

In the limit of small external forces, fext  ≪  κ / L2, we obtain a linear response to both the motor and the external force, which in the case of clamped-free boundary conditions reads:

[formula]

Limit of large motor force fm

In the limit of large motor force, [formula], we expect the left part of the filament to display the asymptotic (Marko-Siggia) force extension for large fm and indeed it does:

[formula]

However the extension of the right part of the filament is not just given by the expression for a wormlike chain under tension fext but shows a correction of [formula]

[formula]

The strength of the effect depends on the external pulling force (see Fig. [\ref=LargeG]) and is strongest for weak pulling force. Explicit forms of [formula] and α(fext) are given in the Appendix.

In the limit of small external force, fext  ≪  κ / L2  ≪  fm and κ / L2m  ≪  fm, we obtain a linear force-extension relation:

[formula]

Limit of large force fext and fm =  - fext  +  ε

Next, we consider the limit of a large external pulling force, which is almost compensated by the motor in the left part of the filament. In other words, we put fm =  - fext  +  ε and consider the case with [formula] and [formula]. In this limit, the right part of the filament is asymptotically extended

[formula]

The total extension in this limit is given by

[formula]

The first term accounts for the reduction in length due to thermal fluctuations in the left part only and hence [formula]. The tension in the left part is just ε  ≪  1 which accounts for the last term. However the pulling force fext affects the orientation of the tangent at Lm and hence also the extension of the left part of the filament so the dominant term for strong pulling force is not just determined by the right part of the filament.

relation to single-motor experiments

Our results can be tested experimentally using optical tweezers. Beads attached to the two ends of the biomolecule which acts as track (e.g., F-actin) are trapped with optical tweezers. The motor (e.g., myosin-V) is attached with one end to a fixed bead and with the other end to the filament. Since the two end beads are free to rotate, this arrangement corresponds to the case of hinged-hinged boundary conditions. This experimental set-up has already been used in many single-molecule mechanical transducers [\cite=Veigel_Schmidt_NR2011]. The "three-bead" technique was pioneered by Finer et al. [\cite=Finer_1994]. The main idea is to measure the variance of the end-beads' position which is related to the stiffness of the actomyosin cross-bridge complex within linear elasticity [\cite=Veigel_Molloy_2001] [\cite=Veigel_1998]. Conformational changes in the motor induce changes in the effective stiffness of the bridge which is measured experimentally. In our model, the conformational change in myosin changes the motor force fm. This can be due to a change in the position of attachment of the myosin head on the actin filament, Lm, or a change in the effective spring constant, km, or both.

Our results have been obtained in the fixed force ensemble, where the tension on the filament is determined sharply and this results in a fluctuating extension, whose average we have calculated. The positions of the motor bead, which determines X0 in our model, and of the left filament end are held fixed. This can be done by using a very stiff optical trap. As shown by Gerland et al. in [\cite=Gerland_Bundschuh_Hwa], a polymer held between two optical traps is represented by the mixed ensemble, where both the tension and the extension fluctuate. This mixed ensemble interpolates between the fixed extension ensemble (corresponding to the limit of very stiff traps) and fixed force ensemble (corresponding to the limit of very soft traps). Therefore, our general results for hinged-hinged boundary conditions can be tested with a set up involving a very soft optical trap for the right end of the filament. We should point out, that the force-extension relation given by Eq. [\ref=large_f_thermodyn] holds in the thermodynamic limit and as such is ensemble independent (fixed force or fixed extension). In addition, the linear response results are ensemble independent.

In real systems, the spring will act not only in the longitudinal direction but also in the transverse direction. The effect of a transverse spring of zero rest length in the force-extension relation of a weakly bending wormlike chain has been calculated in [\cite=PB_SU_AZ_NJP]. For a spring of finite rest length which is almost parallel to the longitudinal direction of the filament, the transverse effect is of higher order and can be neglected. For a spring of zero rest length but with [formula], we can simply add the following contribution to the right-hand side of Eq. [\ref=large_f_thermodyn]:

[formula]

which holds in the strong stretching limit, f  ≫  κ / L2m. For a soft spring, kmL  ≪  fext, this contribution falls off as ~  f- 2ext, which is subdominant to the longitudinal contribution which falls off as ~  f- 3 / 2ext.

Conclusion-Outlook

We have analysed the force-extension of a wormlike chain whose one end is fixed, while the other end is pulled or pushed by an external force. In addition, the filament is attached to a spring which may represent a cross-link or a motor arrested at its stall force. Irrespective of boundary conditions, the effects of the spring are stronger in the compressive regime as compared to the stretching regime. Depending on the relative sign of the pulling force and the spring force, the latter can substantially stiffen or weaken the filament. When the motor force is small, its effects can be represented by an effective spring constant which strongly depends on the prestress of the fiber, i.e. the external force. When the motor force is large, it gives rise to the same [formula] dependence which is well known from the work of Marko and Siggia [\cite=Marko_Siggia].

The dependence of the force extension curve of the filament on motor force allows to deduce the latter from measurements of the force-extension relation. In fact the so-called three bead geometry has already been used to determine the stiffness of the actomyosin cross-bridge [\cite=Veigel_1998].

An interesting direction for future work is the study of two or more parallel-aligned filaments with non-local spring-like cross-linkers in the direction of alignment. The case of local cross-links has been investigated in [\cite=Alice1] [\cite=Alice2] [\cite=PB_SU_AZ_NJP]. A simplified model of two filaments with a non-local spring has been studied in [\cite=Liverpool_Marchetti_EPL2009].
