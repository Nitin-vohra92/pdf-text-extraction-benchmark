A note on the automorphism group of Schubert varieties

In this article we let [formula] with its usual [formula]-linear vector space structure. We denote by [formula]. We also consider a subset α  ⊆  [m] as an ordered tuple. That is [formula].

A flag of V is a sequence of nested subspaces

[formula]

A flag is called complete if

[formula]

The [formula] Grassmannian of V is the set of all subspaces of V whose dimension is [formula] that is:

[formula]

Now we consider Schubert varieties as special subsets of [formula].

Let

[formula]

Suppose A is a complete flag. The Schubert variety is a subset of [formula] defined as

[formula]

The conditions [formula] are known as the Schubert conditions. We have included the complete flag A in the notation for the Schubert variety ΩAα. For any two complete flags, A and B, the varieties ΩAα and ΩBα are isomorphic. However, the choice of flag determines the exact elements of the Schubert varieties.

Chow proved the following:

The permutations of [formula] which map lines to lines are those given by compositions of

W  ↦  W.M,M∈m(V).

W  ↦  θ(W) where θ is a field automorphism applied to each entry of each element of W.

and [formula] where [formula] is the orthogonal complement of W.

These permutations also act on [formula] when possible. This action is extended to the set of complete flags of V as follows.

Let M∈m(V), θ be a field automorphism and [formula] the dual space operation. Let [formula] We define:

The linear transformation M maps A to M(A) where [formula]

The field automorphism θ maps A to θ(A) where [formula]

The orthogonal space operator, [formula] maps the complete flag A to, [formula] where [formula]

Schubert Varieties

Some of the Schubert conditions [formula] may be redundant. Suppose α  ⊆  [m] has two consecutive elements, say αi - 1  =  αi - 1. Each W∈ΩAα satisfies [formula]. As dim Aαi  =  αi and dim Aαi - 1  =   dim Aαi - 1 the inequality [formula] implies [formula]. Therefore the condition [formula] is redundant. This motivates the following definition.

We define the essential part of α as

[formula]

That is, the essential part of α is the set of all elements of α which are the biggest element of some maximal consecutive subset of α. The indices of the essential elements of α are also important. We denote the ordered set of the indices as

[formula]

These sets allow for a ΩAα as we shall see now.

Let α  ⊆  [m]. Let [formula] be the essential subflag of A corresponding to α. Then

[formula]

We will prove that the conditions [formula] where i∈essindα imply [formula] for i∈[null]. From the definition of the essential part of α, for any αi∈α there exists an αis such that αi  =  αis - (is - i). The inequality [formula] implies [formula] This finishes the proof.

Laksov and Kleiman [\cite=KL72] proved the following.

[formula]

Now we have the following theorem.

Let α  ⊆  [m]. Let A and B be two complete flags. Then

[formula]

First we prove the only if direction. By hypothesis we asume Aαis  =  Bαis for is∈essindα. Suppose W∈ΩAα. From the definition of the essential subflag we have W∈ΩAα if and only if [formula] for each is∈essindα. As Aαis  =  Bαis this implies [formula] and we conclude W∈ΩBα. Thus ΩAα  ⊆  ΩBα. Exchanging the roles of A and B establishes equality.

Let s be the largest index such that Aαis  ≠  Bαis. Let aαis + 1, aαis + 2, [formula] [formula] be independent elements in [formula]. Define [formula]. From the definition of a Schubert variety the claim that

[formula]

follows easily. Without loss of generality we assume is is the largest essential index of α.

As is is the largest essential index, we may assume without loss of generality that dim W  =  is and W  ⊆  Aαis. As there exists [formula] we may take [formula] as the basis of our required [formula].

Now we aim find the automorphism group of ΩAα.

Suppose α  ⊆  [m]. Let [formula] be the essential subflag of A corresponding to α. Let [formula]. Suppose τ preserves the dimension of any linear subspace of V. Then τ∈Aut(Ωα) if and only if τ(Bi)  =  Bi.

The automorphism [formula] maps ΩAα to Ωτ(A)α. Theorem [\ref=thm:SchubertEqualityTheorem] implies ΩAα  =  Ωτ(A)α if and only if τ(Bi)  =  Bi.

Now we shall determine what happens when [formula] is a contravariant mapping. That is when dim τ(W)  =  m  -   dim W. In this case τ maps A to τ(A). Now we shall find the exact form of β when τ maps ΩAα to Ωτ(A)β.

Let [formula] be a contravariant mapping. Let τ(ΩAα) be the image of ΩAα. Then τ(ΩAα)  =  Ωτ(A)β where [formula]

For each j∈[m] let ij∈[null] be the index such that αij  ≤  j  <  αij + 1. Define [formula]. Let W∈ΩAα. Therefore [formula]. As τ is a contravariant functor, we have [formula]. This is equivalent to dim (τ(W)  +  τ(Aj))  ≤  m - ij. Therefore the intersection has dimension

[formula]

Let B  =  τ(A) and Bm - j  =  τ(Aj). The inequality

[formula]

holds. We seek to determine β such that τ(ΩAα)  =  ΩBβ. To this end we need to determine when dj' increases for j'∈[m].

First suppose im - j'  =  im - j' - 1. In this case as [formula] and [formula] we have that dj' + 1  =  dj' + 1.

In the case when im - j'  ≠  im - j' - 1 this means that im - j' - 1  =  im - j' - 1. In this case [formula] and [formula] we have that dj'  =  dj' + 1.

Therefore for all αi∈α we have that dm - αi - 1  =  dm - αi. Therefore for the conditions

[formula]

hold for τ(W)∈τ(ΩAα). The inequalities for m - j'∈α are reduntant. The inequalities for [formula] are the conditions which define Ωτ(A)β.

For a contravariant mapping [formula] we find when τ(ΩAα)  =  ΩAα.

Let [formula] be a contravariant mapping. Then τ(ΩAα)  =  ΩAα. if and only if [formula] and the essential subflag of A corresponding to α is equal to the essential subflag of τ(A).

It follows from Proposition [\ref=prop:KL], Theorem [\ref=thm:SchubertEqualityTheorem] and Lemma [\ref=lem:dualSchubertaction]

An automorhism of [formula] is an automorphism of ΩAα if and only if it fixes the essential subflag of A corresponding to α.
