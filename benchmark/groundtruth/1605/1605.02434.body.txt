Non-vanishing of automorphic L-functions of prime power level

Introduction

Central values of L-functions associated to different families is an important subject in analytic number theory with numerous applications. In this paper we consider the family H*2k(N) of primitive newforms of level N and weight 2k equipped with the Petersson inner product

[formula]

Here F0(N) is a fundamental domain of the action of the Hecke congruence subgroup Γ0(N) on the upper-half plane

[formula]

The main advantage of considering primitive forms f∈H*2k(N) is that the coefficients appearing in the Fourier expansion

[formula]

are multiplicative

[formula]

For each f∈H*2k(N) we associate an L-function

[formula]

such that the completed L-function

[formula]

satisfies the functional equation

[formula]

and can be analytically continued on the whole complex plane.

The point s = 1 / 2 is the symmetry point of functional equation [\eqref=eq:_functionalE]. For N large enough the harmonic proportion of non-vanishing is defined by

[formula]

Subscript h indicates that the average is taken with the weight

[formula]

Brumer's conjecture predicts that c = 1 / 2 as N  →    ∞  . This is still an open problem but there are some remarkable results towards its solution:

Duke [\cite=Duk]: c = A /  log 2N, N is prime, A is a positive constant;

Vanderkam [\cite=Van]: c = 1 / 48, N is prime;

Kowalski-Michel [\cite=KM]: c = 1 / 6, N is prime;

Iwaniec-Sarnak [\cite=IS]: c = 1 / 4, N is square-free and φ(N)  ~  N;

Rouymi [\cite=R2]: c[formula], N = pν, p is a fixed prime, ν  →    ∞  .

The value c = 1 / 4 is a natural barrier. Iwaniec and Sarnak [\cite=IS] showed that if inequality [\eqref=pn] holds for some c > 1 / 4 with an additional lower bound

[formula]

there are no Landau-Siegel zeros for Dirichlet L-functions of real primitive characters.

The aim of the present paper is to improve the results of Rouymi by proving a lower bound on the proportion of non-vanishing central values of L-function of level N = pν, ν  ≥  2 which corresponds to the one obtained by Iwaniec and Sarnak [\cite=IS] in case of square-free level. Our main result is the following.

Let N = pν, p is a fixed prime. For any ε > 0

[formula]

Let N = pν, ν  ≥  2 is fixed. For any ε > 0

[formula]

The proof is based on asymptotic evaluation of twisted moments

[formula]

[formula]

The previously known results for prime power level are due to Rouymi.

(lemmas 4 and 5 of [\cite=R2]) Let k  ≥  1, N = pν, p is prime, ν  ≥  3, (l,p) = 1. Then for all 1  ≤  l  ≤  N and ε > 0 we have

[formula]

[formula]

Using lemma [\ref=lem:R] and the technique of mollification Rouymi obtained a lower bound on the proportion of non-vanishing.

(theorem 1 of [\cite=R2]) Let k  ≥  1 and p be a fixed prime number. For all ε > 0, Ω < 1 / 4 there is a constant ν0  =  ν0(p,k,ε,Ω) such that for ν  ≥  ν0 and N = pν we have

[formula]

The parameter L: = NΩ is called the length of mollifier and Ω is called the logarithmic length of mollifier. As v  →    ∞   one can take Ω = 1 / 4 - ε in [\eqref=proportion] so that

[formula]

In his papers Rouymi didn't consider the opposite case: N = pν, ν is fixed and p  →    ∞   over primes. However, using lemma [\ref=tracebound], it is possible to obtain asymptotic formulas for [\eqref=m1rouymi] and [\eqref=m2rouymi] that are uniform in both parameters p and ν.

(theorem 2.2 of [\cite=R0], page 23) Let k  ≥  1, N = pν, ν  ≥  2, (p,mn) = 1. Then where

[formula]

This gives an extra factor [formula] in the error terms for the first and second moments. Therefore, one can take Ω < 1 / 4 - 1 / (4ν) for the second moment and Ω  <  1 / 4 - 1 / (2ν) for the first moment. This means that the length of mollifier is at most N1 / 4 - 1 / (2ν). As a consequence, theorem [\ref=Royumi_theorem] cannot be extended to the case N = p2. If ν > 2 we, for example, have

[formula]

To make the proportion of non-vanishing independent of p and prove [\eqref=secondcase], we obtain estimates on the error terms for the first and second moments when l > N. Then theorem [\ref=thm:main] is proved by extending the length of mollifier up to N for the first moment and up to N1 / 2 for the second moment. Therefore, any Ω < 1 / 2 is admissible.

Asymptotic formula for the second moment, which is the hardest part of our arguments, is derived in [\cite=BalFrol]. The proof is based on techniques developed by Kuznetsov and Bykovskii, see [\cite=Byk] [\cite=BF] [\cite=BF2] [\cite=Kuz]. Here we give a simplified version of the main theorem.

(theorem 1.1 of [\cite=BalFrol]) Let k  ≥  1, p be a prime, [formula], T: = 3 + |t|, N = pν and ν  ≥  2. If p|l then M2(l,0,it) = 0. For (l,p) = 1 we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

The second ingredient of our proof is the asymptotic evaluation of M1(l,0,it). The first moment over the full basis of cusp forms (or over the space of primitive forms of prime level and small weight) has been studied intensively in different aspects. See, for example, [\cite=Ak], [\cite=Bet], [\cite=Duk], [\cite=Ell], [\cite=JK], and [\cite=Kam]. In case of prime power level and weight 2 the best known error term for M1(l,0,it) with respect to parameters N, T and l is obtained in [\cite=Bet].

(particular case of theorem 1.1 of [\cite=Bet]) Let 2k = 2, [formula], T = 1 + |t|, N = pν, p is a prime such and ν  ≥  2. If p|l then M1(l,0,it) = 0. For (l,p) = 1 uniformly in N, l, T, p

[formula]

In sections [\ref=section4] and [\ref=section5] we prove an asymptotic formula for the first moment when k > 1. Our formula is uniform in all considered parameters and allows extending the logarithmic length of mollifier Ω up to 1 in both weight and level aspects.

Let 2k  ≥  4, [formula], T = 1 + |t|, N = pν, p is a prime and ν  ≥  2. If p|l then M1(l,0,it) = 0. For (l,p) = 1 uniformly in N, l, T, p and k where

Combining the last two estimates in one, we have This is consistent with the error term in theorem [\ref=thm:Bet] and this improves the results of [\cite=Ich], [\cite=R] and [\cite=R2]. For l = 1 the improvement is even more significant: we obtain the error term Ok,ε(N- k) instead of [formula] proved in [\cite=R].

Our method is different from the techniques applied in the prior literature. In particular, it is not based on the approximate functional equation. Instead we compute the explicit formula for the shifted first moment and then continue it analytically to the critical point. An advantage of such approach is a better understanding of the structure of error terms. The case N = p2 is particularly interesting since asymptotic formula has an additional error term coming from a pole of the Lerch zeta function. We study this case separately in section [\ref=section4].

The paper is organized as follows. In section [\ref=section2] we remind the reader of some background information. Section [\ref=section3] is devoted to studying a special function which appears as a part of an error term. Asymptotics of the first moment is computed in sections [\ref=section4] and [\ref=section5]. In the last section we prove the main theorem using the technique of mollification.

Background information

We follow the notations of [\cite=BalFrol] and let

The key tool of our computations is the Petersson trace formula.

(Petersson's trace formula) For m,n  ≥  1 we have

[formula]

where H2k(N) is a basis of the space of cusp forms of level N and weight 2k.

(remark 4 of [\cite=R]) Let N = pν with prime p and ν  ≥  2. Then

[formula]

The error term

Let [formula], [formula], [formula] with [formula] and T: = 1 + |t|. The main object of this section is the function

[formula]

with [formula]. This integral appears in the error term of the asymptotic formula for the first moment. We estimate I±(0,v,k,x) distinguishing two cases of large and small argument x.

The case of large x

For x > Te / k we have

[formula]

Since Δ / 2 > 1 / 2 - k, the contour in [\eqref=int:I] is located to the right of all singularities sj = 1 / 2 - k - j for [formula] The function under the integral is bounded by [formula]. Shifting the contour to the left, we have

[formula]

Thus Using the functional equation for the Gamma function and the inequality

[formula]

we obtain Therefore, To estimate the factorials we rewrite them in the following way Applying Stirling's formula [formula] one has

[formula]

Using the last two estimates we obtain This gives Since one has that for [formula]

[formula]

Applying Stirling's formula and [\eqref=estimate1] we have for [formula]

The case of small x

For x  ≤  Te / k we have

[formula]

[formula]

Moving the contour of integration in [\eqref=int:I] to [formula] we have Note that According to equation 8.332(3) of [\cite=GR] Therefore, Without loss of generality we assume that t > 1.

First, we estimate e-  πt / 2I+(0,v,k,x). Since we have

[formula]

Consider the first integral

[formula]

Let Since f'1(r),f'2(r) <  - 1 / 2 the second integral can be evaluated as follows

[formula]

Finally,

[formula]

Similarly to the previous case

[formula]

Estimating the first integral we have The second integral splits further into two parts Note that and

Therefore,

Asymptotic formula for the first moment: ν  ≥  3

Consider the twisted first moment of automorphic L-functions associated to primitive forms of weight 2k  ≥  4 and level N = pν with p prime and ν  ≥  3

[formula]

In this section we prove the following theorem

Let k  ≥  2, p be a prime, [formula] and T: = 1 + |t|. For N = pν, ν  ≥  3 we have

[formula]

Here

[formula]

Suppose that [formula], [formula], k  ≥  2, N = pν and ν  ≥  3. Then

[formula]

[formula]

Consider

[formula]

The condition (n,p) = 1 can be removed by splitting S(l,u,v;N) into two parts.

One has

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

Let (l,p) = 1, k  ≥  2, N = pν and ν  ≥  3. Then

[formula]

Using Petersson's trace formula [\eqref=eq:Petersson], we obtain

[formula]

Since (l,p) = 1, we have δ(l,np) = 0. Note that N / p  ≥  p2 because N = pν, ν  ≥  3. Thus, [formula] in the expressions for S2(l,u,v;N) and S2(l,u,v;N / p). Further, one has (l,p) = 1. Therefore, lemma [\ref=Royer] implies Kl(l,pn;q) = 0. The assertion follows.

Let k  ≥  2, N = pν and ν  ≥  3. Let [formula] and [formula]. Then

[formula]

where

[formula]

The series in [\eqref=eq:V] over n and q converge absolutely for [formula], [formula].

Equation [\eqref=eq:s11] follows from Petersson's trace formula [\eqref=eq:Petersson]. Estimating the Bessel function and the Kloosterman sum, we have

[formula]

Thus, the series over q in the second sum is convergent for 2λ - 1 / 2 > 1. Evaluating the sum over q we have Taking [formula] the series over n is absolutely convergent.

Lemma [\ref=lem:v] allows changing the order of summation

[formula]

[formula]

For [formula] let

[formula]

Note that

[formula]

The next step is to apply the Mellin-Barnes representation for the Bessel function.

For [formula], [formula]

[formula]

where [formula], [formula].

Using the properties of the Lerch zeta function we prove the functional equation and analytic continuation for g(s,v;q).

For [formula] and [formula] the function g(s,v;q) can be analytically continued on the whole complex plane as a function of complex variable s. Furthermore, for [formula] one has

[formula]

where [formula]

Consider

[formula]

Applying the functional equation for the Lerch zeta function we have

[formula]

Note that Therefore,

[formula]

Analogously,

[formula]

Now we can express VN(u,v,λ) in terms of the integrals I±(u,v,λ,x) studied in section [\ref=section3].

For [formula] and [formula] one has

[formula]

where [formula] and

[formula]

Moving the contour of integration in [\eqref=eq:vn] to [formula]

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=lem:g] we have

[formula]

Note that for - u + Δ / 2 < 0 the integral over s converges since If 1 / 2 - u - Δ / 2 > 1, then the series over n and q are convergent as well and, therefore, we can change the order of summation and integration. The assertion follows.

Finally, explicit formula [\eqref=theorem_nu3_statement] follows from lemmas [\ref=lemM1=S-S], [\ref=lemS=S1-S2], [\ref=lemS2=0], [\ref=lem:v] and [\ref=lemV=] by means of analytic continuation to [formula] We are left to prove estimate [\eqref=lemVestimate].

Let k  ≥  2, [formula] and T: = 1 + |t|. Let [formula]. Then

[formula]

Estimating [\eqref=eq:vnuv] one has We apply lemmas [\ref=lem:Ilargex] and [\ref=lem:Ismallx] to bound the last expression. For d0  ≥  1

[formula]

For d0 < 1

[formula]

Asymptotic formula for the first moment: ν = 2

Suppose that [formula], k  ≥  2 and N = p2 with p prime. Then

[formula]

where VN(0,v,k) can be estimated by [\eqref=lemVestimate].

Similarly to lemma [\ref=lemM1=S-S] we prove the following decomposition.

Suppose that [formula], [formula], k  ≥  2, N = p2. Then

[formula]

where S(l,u,v;N) is given by [\eqref=eq:s].

The sum S(l,u,v;p2) can be evaluated with the methods of the previous section. This gives

[formula]

where S1(l,u,v;p2) is defined by [\eqref=eq:s1]. The sum S(l,u,v;p) splits into two parts

[formula]

Here

[formula]

and S2(l,u,v;p) is given by [\eqref=eq:s2]. Note that if N = p we cannot use the property of vanishing of Kloosterman sums [\eqref=Royer] to evaluate S2(l,u,v;p).

For (l,p) = 1 we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

In the region of absolute convergence we can change the order of summations.

For [formula], [formula] we have

[formula]

[formula]

For [formula] let

[formula]

Using the definition of Kloosterman sums

[formula]

Since (b,qp) = 1 the function ζ(0,bp / q,s + v) has a pole only if q = 1 or q = p. Because (l,p) = 1 we have This gives

[formula]

Applying the Mellin-Barnes representation for the Bessel function we obtain

For [formula], [formula]

[formula]

where [formula]

For [formula], p|q and [formula] the function [formula] can be meromorphically continued on the whole complex plane as a function of complex variable s. Furthermore, for [formula] one has

[formula]

where the functions

[formula]

with [formula] satisfy

[formula]

Applying the functional equation for the Lerch zeta function we have

[formula]

Note that

[formula]

Consider the sum over a,b. Since [formula], there is t ( p) such that b = n + tq / p. Then [formula] implies [formula]. Further, Therefore, Condition [formula] implies that Consequently, The inequality [\eqref=fineq] can be proved as follows. If (q / p,p) = 1 then requirement (n* + sq / p,p) = 1 is not satisfied only for one s. Since (l,p) = 1 we conclude that and, therefore, If [formula] then condition (n* + sq / p,p) = 1 is equivalent to (n*,p) = 1. In this case

The following statement can be proved in the same manner as lemma [\ref=lemV=]

For [formula] and [formula] one has

[formula]

where I±(u,v,λ,x) and f±(n) are defined by [\eqref=Idef] and [\eqref=eq:fpm], respectively.

Let N = p2. Then

[formula]

[formula]

First, we make analytic continuation to [formula] The inequality [\eqref=fineq] allows estimating the series over n in [\eqref=eq:vtilde2] similarly to lemma [\ref=lem:estv]. This proves [\eqref=eqv3]. Equation [\eqref=eq:slp] follows from [\eqref=sumsp], [\eqref=sumsp1], [\eqref=sumsp2] and [\eqref=eqv3].

Mollification at the center of the critical strip

Using the technique of mollification and theorems [\ref=thm:main2], [\ref=thm:Bet], [\ref=thm:BF] we prove a lower bound on the proportion of non-vanishing L-functions at the critical point 1 / 2. Note that due to the uniformity of our results in t-aspect a positive proportion of non-vanishing L-values can also be established at any point on the critical line 1 / 2 + it such that |t| < N.

We choose the standard mollifier of the form

[formula]

where (xl) are real coefficients and L = NΩ is called the length of mollifier. Then

[formula]

and

[formula]

Theorems [\ref=thm:main2], [\ref=thm:Bet], [\ref=thm:BF] imply that any Ω < 1 is admissible for the first moment and Ω < 1 / 2 for the second moment. Therefore, the length of mollifier can be taken up to N1 / 2. Following [\cite=R2] we set

[formula]

where

[formula]

By Cauchy-Schwartz inequality (see [\cite=R2] for details)

[formula]

Taking Ω = 1 / 2 - ε as N  →    ∞   we prove theorem [\ref=thm:main].
