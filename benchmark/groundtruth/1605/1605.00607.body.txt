A spacetime estimate for hard spheres

Introduction

The problem of interest to us is that of deriving various nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) starting from the Newtonian gas of N hard spheres. Depending on the chosen scalings, the relevant PDE could be the Navier-Stokes equations, Boltzmann's equation, etc. The existence and uniqueness of solutions to nonlinear PDEs is generally an open problem, except in the presence of very special conservation principles or perturbative assumptions. Even when solutions are known, the analysis tends to be quite complicated, depending on the strength of available a priori estimates for a hypothetical solution. For this reason, we are naturally led to the problem of deriving analogous a priori bounds on the particle model.

The main focus of this work is Proposition [\ref=prop:s4-interaction], which is a virial-type spacetime estimate for hard spheres. Virial-type estimates are essentially classical in the billiards literature, and they play a prominent role in the derivation of Boltzmann's equation. [\cite=IP1989] The main difference with Proposition [\ref=prop:s4-interaction] is that the bound controls a quantity closely associated with the hard sphere BBGKY hierarchy, with no "smallness" conditions imposed on the initial data.

Section [\ref=sec:2] introduces the basic notation of this work, which mostly follows the presentation of [\cite=GSRT2014]. Section [\ref=sec:3] gives an elementary derivation of an identity due to Illner [\cite=I1989]. In Section [\ref=sec:4], we apply Illner's identity in a heuristic manner to derive the virial-type spacetime estimate; a rigorous proof may be found in [\cite=De2016].

Notation

Consider N hard spheres centered at positions [formula] with velocities [formula] for [formula]. The spheres are considered to have identical mass and radius, and are in all other ways physically indistinguishable. For convenience, we will assume without loss that all particles have unit diameter. The collection of all positions is a tuple XN, and the velocities are similarly denoted The classical phase-space coordinates of ith particle are given by zi  =  (xi,vi), and the phase-space coordinates of the whole gas are denoted We may also write [formula]. The following function will play a central role in our analysis: for [formula] and [formula], we define

[formula]

Finally we may introduce the N-particle phase space DN, which is defined by

[formula]

The choice of DN is motivated by requirement that the spheres be mutually disjoint at all times. The closure of DN in [formula] in the standard topology is denoted [formula], and we will also write [formula]. We will use the notation [formula] to refer to a typical point for the Lebesgue measure on DN. The notation [formula] will refer to a typical point for the induced surface measure arising from the natural embedding [formula].

Formally speaking, we wish to solve Newton's laws with a hard core interaction. This means if ZN(t0)  =  (XN(t0),VN(t0))∈DN then Hence the particles move freely between collisions. At each collision (that is, ZN(t0)∈∂DN), the particles are required to interact elastically, thereby conserving momentum, energy, and angular momentum. The set of possible interactions for two-body elastic collisions is easy to parametrize explicitly. Suppose that there exists i < j such that xj(t0)  =  xi(t0)  +  ω for some [formula]; and, further suppose that [formula] for any [formula] such that [formula]. Let us denote Then we have

Similarly for [formula] we will use the notation Z*N to refer to the image of the point ZN through the collision transformation. The map ZN  ↦  Z*N is a measurable involution.

In the above "definition," we have neglected to specify uniquely what happens when more than two particles collide at the same time. Multiple particle interactions occur with zero probability, though this statement requires justification which we will not discuss. The hard sphere flow at time t defines a measurable map For each [formula], the map ψtN preserves the Lebesgue measure on [formula]. Complete proofs of the existence of the hard sphere flow ψtN may be found in the literature. [\cite=Al1975] [\cite=GSRT2014]

Following Boltzmann's great insight, we realize that it is not very interesting to discuss any particular trajectory [formula], because it is physically infeasible (or impossible) to measure the positions and velocities of all the particles at a given instant. Therefore, the initial value problem for Newton's laws is not the correct problem for us to solve. The correct approach is to place a probability density fN(0,ZN) on the set of possible initial states ZN∈DN. The function fN(0,ZN) represents our uncertainty about the actual configuration of the particles. Since we have no physical means to distinguish between two particles in our model, the function fN(0,ZN) must be symmetric with respect to interchange of particle indices.

We will denote by SN the symmetric group on N letters. Any permutation σ∈SN acts on the phase-space coordinates [formula] as follows: Similarly, if fN(ZN) is any function on DN, then σ acts on fN by composition: [formula]. Let [formula] denote the set of probability measures on DN, and furthermore let [formula] denote the set of probability measures which are absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure on DN. Any element of [formula] may be represented uniquely ([formula]) by a non-negative function fN(ZN) such that [formula]. Finally let [formula] be the set of absolutely continuous measures on DN such that the associated function fN is invariant under the action of SN. Henceforth, when we write fN, we will always mean an element of [formula].

Let fN(0) be any element of [formula], which we regard as the initial state of the N particle gas. For any [formula] we will let fN(t) be the pushforward of fN(0) under the hard sphere flow ψtN; then, fN(t) is likewise an element of [formula]. Since ψtN preserves the Lebesgue measure on DN, we may write the following expression for fN(t):

[formula]

The functions fN(0) and fN(t) may be extended by zero so as to be defined on [formula].

It turns out that fN(t) still contains too much information to be a useful description of the state of the gas. Therefore, for any 1  ≤  s  ≤  N, we define the marginal f(s)N(t) by partial integration:

[formula]

The evolution of the marginals f(s)N(t) may be described explicitly via the so-called BBGKY hierarchy (Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon) [\cite=GSRT2014], though we will not be making any use of the BBGKY hierarchy in this work. The marginals f(s)N(t) are non-negative symmetric functions on [formula] with unit mass.

The spacetime estimate will control the trace of the marginals f(s)N(t) along a certain hypersurface, with at most polynomial growth in N for large values of N. This is slightly problematic because the trace of an L1 function is simply not defined; moreover, even if the data fN(0) is smooth, the function fN(t) typically develops singularities. Nevertheless, due to technical arguments which we will not discuss, it is possible to show that if fN(0) is smooth then the required traces of f(s)N(t) do, in fact, exist. See [\cite=CGP1997] [\cite=GSRT2014] [\cite=Si2014] [\cite=PS2015II] for more information on regularity issues for hard spheres. Our estimates do not depend on the choice of regularization, except insofar as the regularized marginals must be a sequence of symmetric non-negative functions which are indeed marginals in the sense of ([\ref=eq:s2-f-N-s]).

Illner's identity

Let us fix an initial point ZN∈DN in the microscopic phase-space, and consider the trajectory [formula]. Our analysis begins with a simple observation: with rN(t,ZN) as in ([\ref=eq:s2-r-N-def]), if we define

[formula]

then for any t0 such that ψt0NZN∈DN we have

[formula]

Indeed, we see that if [formula] and [formula] then Therefore, the difference rZN(t)  -  rZN(0) is simply equal to a sum along collisions of incremental jumps in rZN(t). It will turn out that all of these jumps have the same sign, and we can write the jumps explicitly to yield Illner's identity.

Let us compute the jump in rZN(t) across a collision taking place at time [formula]. We may assume that the interacting particles are simply those labelled i = 1,2, since collisions are binary and particles are indistinguishable. The position coordinates are continuous in time, so we write them x1,x2, with x2  =  x1  +  ω for some [formula]. The pre-collisional velocities will be denoted [formula] and the post-collisional velocities will be denoted [formula]. We have Due to energy conservation, so we may eliminate the explicit dependence on t0. Since x2  =  x1  +  ω, this gives us Due to momentum conservation, so we may eliminate the explicit dependence on the position coordinates. Hence This is the same as by the collisional change of variables from Section ([\ref=sec:2]). But v1,v2 are the velocities of the two particles coming into a collision, so we must have and therefore [formula]. Hence, Adding up all collisions along the trajectory we obtain Illner's identity: [\cite=I1989]

(Illner's identity) For [formula] and [formula] there holds

[formula]

where the sum [formula] is over all collisions along the trajectory [formula] for 0  ≤  τ  ≤  t.

We will require an auxiliary lemma of Illner & Pulvirenti which follows easily from Illner's identity. [\cite=IP1989] In order to state the lemma, we introduce a new function on DN,

[formula]

The proof is a computation, which we include for completeness.

For [formula] and all [formula], we have

[formula]

By time-reversibility we may assume t  ≥  0. The function IN(ψtNZN) is globally continuous in t for [formula]. With this in mind, it suffices to point out that the desired inequality is true for t = 0, and between collisions we have We conclude by Proposition [\ref=prop:s3-Illner].

The next lemma is technical, and again follows from Illner's identity.

For [formula], all t  ≥  0, and all λ  >  0, there holds

[formula]

Recall that [formula]. On the other hand, by ([\ref=eq:s2-r-N-def]), We can bound the first term on the last line using Lemma [\ref=lemma:s3-IP-1]. Hence, Replace ZN by ψtNZN on both sides and use the conservation of energy to conclude.

Combining Proposition [\ref=prop:s3-Illner] and Lemma [\ref=lemma:s3-IP-2], we obtain:

For [formula] and all λ > 0, we have

[formula]

where the sum [formula] is over all collisions along the trajectory [formula].

An averaging trick

The previous section was primarily concerned with the number of collisions which occur along a single trajectory [formula]. However, as has been explained in Section [\ref=sec:2], we are really interested in ensemble averages over many trajectories. This is due to the physical fact that we cannot say with any precision what the initial state ZN "really" is. We will prove the spacetime estimate by averaging both sides of ([\ref=eq:s3-IP-3]) with respect to the same measure fN(0,ZN)dZN and applying a change of variables on the left-hand side. The change of variables as presented here is not entirely rigorous, though we are confident that this approach can be converted into a rigorous proof. An alternative, completely rigorous, proof of the virial-type estimate has already been given. [\cite=De2016]

We will find it helpful to define an auxiliary function,

[formula]

Observe that [formula] if ZN∈∂DN represents a collision between particles i and j with xj  =  xi  +  ω. For any ZN∈DN let ĩN(ZN), N(ZN) be chosen such that [formula] for all i  ≠  j. This uniquely defines ĩN,N for [formula] and also for [formula]. Let us finally define

[formula]

so that WN(ZN) is always equal to the correct collision parameter [formula] globally along ∂DN.

The "proof" of the spacetime estimate is based on the following observation: the collision sum [formula] on the left-hand side of ([\ref=eq:s3-IP-3]) may be re-cast as an integral in time: Average both sides with respect to fN(0,ZN)dZN. The double integral on the right-hand side reduces (by Fubini) to an integral of "something" over ∂DN, due to the delta-function and the identity fN(t,ZN)  =  fN(0,ψ- tNZN). Unfortunately, making the change of variables precise requires a technical application of the divergence theorem and careful manipulation of delta functions. (The proof of [\cite=De2016] avoids any mention of delta functions.) Here we record the result of correct manipulations:

[formula]

where dσNdVN represents the surface measure on ∂DN.

To conclude, we bound the left hand side of ([\ref=eq:s4-identity]) using Corollary [\ref=cor:s3-IP-3], then reduce both sides using the symmetry of fN(t) and the definition of the marginals of fN(t). We have also simplified the right-hand side by optimal choice of the parameter λ  >  0.

For each [formula], let fN(0) be an initial probability density on DN, which we assume to be symmetric under particle interchange, and let fN(t,ZN)  =  fN(0,ψ- tNZN). Let f(s)N(t), 1  ≤  s  ≤  N, denote the s-marginal of fN(t). Further assume that fN(0) is smooth and compactly supported in the interior of DN. Then for all 2  ≤  s  ≤  N there holds

[formula]

where [formula] and Cd is a constant depending only on the dimension d.
