Right-Handed Neutrinos and T-Violating, P-Conserving Interactions

Introduction

The search for time-reversal violation (TV) has long been a subject of considerable experimental and theoretical interest. It is partially motivated by the need for CP-violation beyond that encoded in the Standard Model (SM) Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix to explain the cosmic baryon asymmetry[\cite=Sakharov:1967dj]. Assuming CPT is a good symmetry of nature, searches for TV provide a probe of this possible CP-violation. Experimentally, the parity (P)- and T-violating (PVTV) sector is being probed with great sensitivity through electric dipole moment (EDM) searches, with the three most stringent limits having been obtained for the 199Hg atom[\cite=Graner:2016ses], the electron (extracted from the ThO molecule)[\cite=Baron:2013eja], and the neutron[\cite=Afach:2015sja] [\cite=Baker:2006ts]. various experiments on electric dipole moments (EDMs) (see, e.g. [\cite=Baron:2013eja] [\cite=Griffith:2009zz] [\cite=Baker:2006ts]). On the other hand, the P-conserving and T-violating (PCTV) sector ( equivalent to C- and CP-violation assuming CPT) has received considerably less attention. Experimental efforts in the sector include measurement of anomalous η-decay channels such as η  →  2π0γ, 3π0γ, 3γ [\cite=Beringer:1900zz] and the D-coefficient in the β-decay of polarized neutrons [\cite=Mumm:2011nd] and 19Ne [\cite=Hallin:1984mr]. These processes are sensitive probes of new physics  because the Standard Model (SM) contributions are usually small [\cite=Dicus:1975cz] [\cite=Herczeg:1997se]. There is a SM final-state interaction that could mimic a non-zero D-coefficient in β-decay at order 10- 5 for neutron [\cite=Callan:1967zz] and 10- 4 for 19Ne [\cite=Hallin:1984mr] but the application of heavy baryon effective field theory allows a precise computation of this contribution (up to 1% accuracy in the case of neutron [\cite=Ando:2009jk]).

Theoretically, the effect of PCTV physics due to Beyond Standard Model (BSM) interactions can be studied in a model-independent way using effective field theory (EFT). In this approach, one has integrated out the BSM heavy degrees of freedom (DOFs). In this context, it was observed in Ref. [\cite=Conti:1992xn] that any EDM limits imply severe bounds on PCTV observables since a PCTV interaction in the presence of P-violating SM radiative corrections will induce an EDM. While special exceptions to this argument may occur [\cite=RamseyMusolf:1999nk] [\cite=Kurylov:2000ub], the question remains as to the prospective impact of, and motivation for, improved probes of flavor-conserving PCTV observables. Recently, the authors of Ref. [\cite=Ng:2011ui] addressed this question in the EFT context, studying the contribution of the left-right four fermion  (LR4F) operator to the D-coefficient of the neutron β-decay (defined below). They find that the neutron EDM sets an indirect bound on the D-coefficient that is three orders of magnitude more stringent than its direct experimental bound.

In this paper, we observe that there exists a set of dimension-six four-fermion operators involving right-handed neutrinos that (a) contribute to the D-coefficient and (b) are relatively unconstrained by EDM limits. Because the SM charge changing weak interaction involves purely left-handed leptons, this contribution to neutron decay does not interfere linearly with the SM contribution, resulting in a quadratic, rather than linear, dependence on the operator Wilson coefficients. Nonetheless, present limits on D probe the TeV mass scale. In addition, one may infer indirect limits from the scale of neutrino mass and naturalness considerations, though the latter are not airtight. We also show that while a subset of these operators generate hadronic EDMs, their effects are suppressed by loop factors as well as Λχ / v where Λχ  ~  1 GeV is the chiral symmetry breaking scale and v = 246 GeV is the Higgs vacuum expectation value (VEV), and therefore do not place a stringent indirect bound on the D-coefficient. With this observation, we conclude that if right-handed neutrinos exist in nature, then experimental probe of PCTV effects in β-decay provides a unique window on possible BSM TV interactions involving these degrees of freedom.

Our analysis leading to these conclusions is organized as follows. In Sec. [\ref=sec:vR] we introduce the relevant set of dimension-6 operators and discuss the experimental D-coefficient constraint on their Wilson coefficients. We then compare this constraint to those implied by hadronic EDMs and by neutrino mass and naturalness considerations. For comparison, we perform in Sec. [\ref=sec:novR] a similar analysis of other dimension-6 operators that do not involve right-handed neutrinos. We show that any attempt to evade current EDM constraints and yet keep the size of the D-coefficient experimentally accessible would involve fine tuning at the 10- 11 level. We conclude in Sec. [\ref=sec:conclusion].

Dimension-six operators with right-handed neutrinos

The PCTV observable of interest in β-decay involves a triple correlation of the spin of the decaying particle and the momenta of the outgoing leptons that enters the differential β-decay rate. In what follows, we focus on neutron, for which the experimental bound on the PCTV triple correlation is the most stringent. However, the discussion below can be easily generalized to other cases. The differential decay rate for a polarized neutron is given by:

[formula]

where [formula] is the unit polarization vector of the neutron; [formula] and [formula] are the electron and anti-neutrino momenta, respectively, with corresponding energies Ee(ν); GF is the Fermi constant; and [formula] is the first generation element of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix. The most stringent experimental limit on the D-coefficient is given by [formula] [\cite=Mumm:2011nd] which translates into an upper bound of |D| < 4  ×  10- 4 at 90% CL [\cite=Vos:2015eba].

Theoretically, a non-vanishing contribution can be generated by the interference of amplitudes involving a small set of dimension d = 6 effective operators. Considering only first generation SM fermions and requiring SM gauge invariance, one finds a limited set of such d = 6 TV operators (see Ref. [\cite=Grzadkowski:2010es] for a complete list of gauge-invariant d = 6 operators involving SM fields). As we discuss in Section [\ref=sec:dipole], EDM constraints imply severe bounds on the contribution of these operators to D. Extending the set of fields to include right-handed (RH) neutrinos, one finds an additional set of four-fermion operators that contribute to D at tree-level and that are relatively immune to EDM constraints:

[formula]

where Λ is the BSM mass scale. These operators are analogous to the semi-leptonic four-fermion operators of type (R)(R) and (R)(L) in Ref. [\cite=Grzadkowski:2010es].

It is straightforward to compute the contributions of Ô1 - 3 to the D-coefficient. The dominant affect is quadratic in the ci  /  Λ2, as the linear interference term is suppressed by the neutrino mass. Following Ref. [\cite=Jackson:1957zz], we obtain, to leading non-trivial order in {ci},

[formula]

where gS and gT are the nucleon scalar and tensor charge respectively.

Even though one pays a price in BSM sensitivity owing to a quadratic rather than linear dependence on the ci  /  Λ2, the gain achieved by avoiding EDM constraints is considerable (see Section [\ref=sec:dipole]). Taking the updated lattice calculation of gS = 0.95(12) and gT = 1.005(59) [\cite=Gupta:2016rli], we obtain:

[formula]

If we take {ci}  ~  c without distinguishing the real and imaginary part, then this inequality implies that existing D-coefficient studies probe BSM T-violating interactions with RH neutrinos with a sensitivity of [formula]. If we assume [formula] then the current bound implies [formula]TeV.

The operators Ô1 - 3 can induce hadronic EDMs at one-loop order, but their contributions also scale quadratically with the ci  /  Λ2. In particular, the combination of Ô1 and Ô2 may induce the CP-odd four-quark operator [\cite=Engel:2013lsa]

[formula]

via the one-loop graph of Fig. [\ref=fig:4q]. Contributions from loop momenta k  <  Λ vanish, as seen explicitly in dimensional regularization (DR), because it involves a quadratically-divergent integral with massless propagators and because it is infrared finite. Non-vanishing contributions result from [formula] that are associated with matching onto the a priori unknown ultraviolet complete theory that generates the non-vanishing ci. Estimating these matching contributions using a cut-off regulator [\cite=Erwin:2006uc] yields

[formula]

This four-quark operator will in turn induce a neutron EDM dn. In order to find the relation between C(1)quqd and the induced hadronic EDMs one needs to compute corresponding hadronic matrix elements. First-principle calculations of such matrix elements are challenging and presently only exist for simple systems such as ρ-meson (see, e.g. Ref. [\cite=Pitschmann:2012by] and references therein). The results of such calculations are generally consistent with the order-of-magnitude estimation based on naïve dimensional analysis (NDA) [\cite=Manohar:1983md] [\cite=Weinberg:1989dx], so here we shall also provide an NDA estimation of dn:

[formula]

This EDM is suppressed by 1 / (16π2)2 as well as Λχ / v. Given the current upper bound [formula] at 90% CL [\cite=Afach:2015sja] we see that the existing neutron EDM limits are probing [formula] which implies [formula]TeV if [formula].

At first glance, the constraint on new physics scale Λ set by the neutron EDM is slightly tighter than that by the D-coefficient. However, since both estimations made in Eq. [\eqref=eq:4fto4q] and [\eqref=eq:NDA] allow an error within an order of magnitude, one may reasonably conclude that the sensitivity of dn and the D-coefficient to the new physics scale Λ are comparable. Furthermore, hadronic and atomic EDMs depend only on c*1c2 and provide no direct constraint on the contribution from [formula] (j = 1,2) in Eq. ([\ref=eq:Dcoeff]).

Finally, we point out that Ô1 and Ô2 also receive naturalness  bounds from the scale of neutrino mass. Above the electroweak scale, the leading contribution to mν comes from a one-loop diagram with a quark Yukawa insertion, inducing the Yukawa interaction term H̃vR, as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:numass]. Again this contribution vanishes in DR so we estimate it using simple dimensional analysis. After electroweak symmetry breaking, one obtains

[formula]

where mq is the light quark mass and i = 1,2. Taking mν < 1 eV and mq  ≈  5 MeV we obtain [formula]. We stress that this bound is not airtight, as the result may vary considerably, depending on the specific symmetry of the underlying BSM scenario. Neutrino mass naturalness bounds also do not constrain the tensor interaction strength c3. Should a next generate D-coefficient measurement yield a non-vanishing result, the comparison with neutrino mass naturalness considerations would provide interesting input for model-building.

Operators without right-handed neutrinos

In contrast to the discussion of Section [\ref=sec:vR], we consider here d = 6 operators that contain only left-handed (LH) neutrino fields and show that any contributions to the D-coefficient are severely constrained by present EDM limits. In the four-fermion sector, the only operator that gives a tree-level D-coefficient scaling linearly with the BSM coupling strength has the form of ūRγμdRēLγμνL as discussed in Ref. [\cite=Ng:2011ui]. It is actually derived from a gauge-invariant dim-6 operator:

[formula]

Below the electroweak scale, exchange of the W-boson contained in the covariant derivative with the left-handed charged weak current leads to both the semi-leptonic four-fermion operator listed above as well as a four-quark operator of the form ūRγμdRLγμuL. Both operators share the same Wilson coefficient (up to Vud), which is tightly constrained by the the four-quark contribution to the neutron EDM.

The three remaining semi-leptonic four-fermion operators that contain T-odd components are the scalar and tensor operators of the type (R)(R) and (R)(L) [\cite=Grzadkowski:2010es] [\cite=Engel:2013lsa]:

[formula]

Similar to the operators in Eq. [\eqref=eq:Oi], they induce a D-coefficient that scales quadratically with ci  /  Λ2. However, Ôledq, Ô(1)lequ, Ô(3)lequ contribute linearly to hadronic and electron EDMs at the one-loop level in the presence of PV SM interactions. The resulting EDM constraints on the associated D-coefficient contributions are severe.

The remaining class of operators that give rise to the D-coefficient at tree-level are dipole-like operators. Unlike the operators in Eq. [\eqref=eq:4fermion], they induce both the D-coefficient and EDMs linearly so one may wonder whether EDM constraints may be avoided with an appropriate choice of Wilson coefficients at low energy. We will show, however, that this is not possible without fine-tuning at the level of many orders of magnitude. To simplify our discussion, let us concentrate on the dipole-like operators in the purely leptonic sector:

[formula]

The first-two operators are dipole-like while the third operator is included as well because it mixes with the first two via electroweak renormalization. Only ÔeW contributes to D, as it is the only one containing a W field. After electroweak symmetry-breaking, one finds

[formula]

Note the presence of the me / v suppression due to the existence of a derivative in the operator ÔeW. The current upper bound on the neutron D-coefficient implies [formula].

The same set of operators also induces an electron EDM, given by

[formula]

The current upper bound on de [\cite=Baron:2013eja] implies [formula].

At first glance, it seems that one could simply choose [formula] at low energy to avoid the EDM constraint. We want to argue that, however, this choice is highly unnatural because the operators in Eq. [\eqref=eq:op] mix under electroweak renormalization as

[formula]

where [formula]. Numerically, if we assume that the bound on the D-coefficient is marginally satisfied at μ = mW (i.e. [formula] and [formula]), then after the electroweak renormalization we find that [formula] at μ = 10 TeV. However, this number has to be fine-tuned to a precision level of [formula] in order to satisfy the EDM bound at low energy, and therefore it is obviously not natural. The dipole-like operators in the quark sector suffer from the same problem. We conclude that, in the absence of RH neutrinos, EDM constraints imply that the existence of an observable D-coefficient is highly unlikely.

Conclusion

If neutrinos are Dirac particles, implying the existence of light νR in nature, then present limits on the D coefficient indicate that the mass scale of any associated PCTV interactions may be quite significant: [formula] TeV, where c denotes a d = 6 operator Wilson coefficient. The corresponding reach associated with limits on the PCTV triple correlation in polarized 19Ne decay are somewhat weaker, but nevertheless quite interesting. The observation of a non-zero effect in a next generation experiment with either the neutron or nuclei is not precluded by constraints from EDM search null results. Resolving the tension between a non-zero PCTV correlation measurement and neutrino mass naturalness considerations would provide an interesting challenge for model building.
