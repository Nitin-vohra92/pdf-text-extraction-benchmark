Stable decompositions of certain representations of the finite general linear groups

Introduction

Let [formula] be an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero and [formula] a finite field of order q. Denote by Gn the finite general linear group [formula]. For r < n, we consider Gr as a subgroup of Gn in the standard way, and write [formula] for the permutation representation of Gn on the set Gn / Gr. In this paper, we show that the collection of multiplicities which occur in the irreducible decomposition of [formula] as a representation of Gn is independent of n for [formula]. We prove, in fact, a more precise theorem that describes how the irreducible decomposition is independent of n for [formula]. To state the theorem, we need to recall the parametrization of the irreducible representations of Gn over [formula].

The irreducible representations of Gn were found by Green [\cite=Green]. Let Cn be the set of cuspidal irreducible representations of Gn (up to isomorphism), and let [formula]. We set [formula] if ρ∈Cn. By a partition, we mean a non-increasing sequence of non-negative integers [formula] where only finitely many terms are non-zero. If [formula] is a partition, we set [formula]. Let P be the set of partitions. For any function [formula], let It is well-known (see, for example, [\cite=SZ] or [\cite=Zelevinsky]) that there is a natural parametrization of the isomorphism classes of irreducible representations of Gn by functions [formula] such that [formula]. We write [formula] for the irreducible representation of Gn parametrized by [formula].

Let ι∈C1 be the trivial representation of G1. Suppose [formula] is a function and [formula]. If n is an integer [formula], we define the function [formula] with [formula] by It is plain that for each function [formula] with [formula], there exists a unique function [formula] such that [formula] where [formula].

Suppose [formula] is a sequence where each Vn is a representation of Gn over [formula]. We say that the sequence {Vn} is multiplicity stable if there exists an integer [formula] such that in the irreducible decomposition the multiplicities [formula] do not depend on n for [formula]; in particular, for any [formula] such that [formula] is not defined, one has [formula] for every [formula]. We call the smallest such N the multiplicity stability degree of {Vn}.

Fix a non-negative integer m, and let [formula] for [formula]. The sequence {Vn} is multiplicity stable with multiplicity stability degree [formula].

Our motivation to consider the question of multiplicity stability for the sequence in the above theorem comes from representation stability theory, in which a similar phenomenon for representations of symmetric groups is studied in [\cite=CEF] and [\cite=CF]; see [\cite=Farb] for a survey. In particular, an analog of Theorem [\ref=main_theorem] for symmetric groups was proved by Hemmer [\cite=Hemmer] using Pieri's rule. Our proof of Theorem [\ref=main_theorem] uses a branching rule for the finite general linear groups due to Thoma [\cite=Thoma] and Zelevinsky [\cite=Zelevinsky].

In more detail, suppose [formula] is a sequence where each Vn is a representation of Gn over [formula] and each φn is a [formula]-linear map. We say that {Vn,φn} is a consistent sequence if, for every non-negative integer n and for every g∈Gn, the following diagram commutes: (where g acts on Vn + 1 by considering it as an element of Gn + 1). In analogy with [\cite=CF], we made the following definition in [\cite=GW].

A consistent sequence {Vn,φn} is representation stable if the following conditions are satisfied:

For all n sufficiently large, the map φn:Vn  →  Vn + 1 is injective.

For all n sufficiently large, the span of the Gn + 1-orbit of φn(Vn) is all of Vn + 1.

The sequence {Vn} is multiplicity stable.

Let [formula] be the category whose objects are the finite dimensional vector spaces over [formula] and whose morphisms are the pairs (f,K) where f is an injective linear map and K is a complementary subspace to the image of f. More precisely, a morphism X  →  Y in the category [formula] is the data of an injective linear map f:X  →  Y and a subspace K of Y such that Y is the internal direct sum of f(X) and K. The composition of morphisms is defined in the natural way: [formula]. Observe that every endomorphism in the category [formula] is an automorphism, and the group of automorphisms of [formula] as an object of [formula] is the group Gn.

A [formula]-module over a commutative ring R is, by definition, a functor from [formula] to the category of R-modules. We shall recall the notion of finite generation for [formula]-modules in Section [\ref=section_VIC]. It should be noted that [formula]-modules were first introduced and studied by Putman and Sam in [\cite=PS]; they proved, in particular, that finitely generated [formula]-modules over a noetherian ring has an inductive description named central stability (see [\cite=PS]). For a finitely generated [formula]-module V over [formula], our next result gives a description of the asymptotic behaviour of the sequence [formula] as representations of the groups Gn. A [formula]-module V over [formula] defines a consistent sequence {Vn,φn} where [formula] and φn is induced by the morphism (fn,Kn) where fn is the standard inclusion [formula] and Kn is the subspace of vectors in [formula] whose first n coordinates are 0.

Let V be a [formula]-module over [formula] and {Vn,φn} the consistent sequence obtained from V. Then V is finitely generated if and only if {Vn,φn} is representation stable and dim (Vn) <   ∞   for every n. Moreover, if V is finitely generated, then there exists a polynomial [formula] and an integer N such that dim (Vn)  =  P(qn) for all [formula].

As we shall explain in Section [\ref=section_VIC], Theorem [\ref=stability_for_VIC_modules] generalizes the main results of [\cite=GW]. However, the proof of Theorem [\ref=stability_for_VIC_modules] depends crucially on the key propositions in [\cite=GW] and also uses Theorem [\ref=main_theorem].

Branching rule for finite general linear groups

Branching rule

The branching rule of Thoma [\cite=Thoma] for the groups Gn gives a formula for the multiplicity of an irreducible representation of Gn - 1 in the restriction of an irreducible representation of Gn to Gn - 1. We shall use an equivalent combinatorial description of the multiplicity due to Zelevinsky [\cite=Zelevinsky].

First, we introduce some notations.

Suppose that [formula] and [formula] are partitions.

We write [formula] if or equivalently, if the Young diagram of μ can be obtained by adding at most one box to each row in the Young diagram of λ.

We write [formula] if or equivalently, if the Young diagram of λ can be obtained by removing at most one box from each row in the Young diagram of μ.

Obviously, one has [formula] if and only if [formula].

Suppose we have functions [formula] and [formula]. We write [formula] if [formula] for each ρ∈C. Similarly, we write [formula] if [formula] for each ρ∈C.

Recall that we write [formula] for the irreducible representation of Gn parametrized by a function [formula] such that [formula]. The following branching rule was proved by Zelevinsky [\cite=Zelevinsky]; it was also proved by Thoma [\cite=Thoma] in another form.

If [formula] is a function such that [formula], and [formula] is a function such that [formula], then the multiplicity of [formula] in the restriction of [formula] to Gn - 1 is equal to the number of functions [formula] such that [formula] and [formula].

We shall need the branching rule for restriction of an irreducible representation of Gn to Gn - m where [formula].

Suppose [formula] is a function such that [formula], and [formula] is a function such that [formula], where [formula]. By a zigzag path from [formula] to [formula], we mean two sequences of functions such that [formula] for every s, and one has:

[formula]

We define [formula] to be the set of all zigzag paths from [formula] to [formula].

The following theorem follows easily from Fact [\ref=branching_rule_for_1_step].

Suppose [formula] is a function such that [formula], and [formula] is a function such that [formula], where [formula]. Then the multiplicity of [formula] in the restriction of [formula] to Gn - m is equal to [formula].

We use induction on m. The base case m = 1 is precisely Fact [\ref=branching_rule_for_1_step].

Suppose m > 1. Let S be the set of all functions [formula] such that [formula]. By Fact [\ref=branching_rule_for_1_step], we have: Hence, by the induction hypothesis, the multiplicity of [formula] in [formula] is equal to:

Proof of Theorem [\ref=main_theorem]

We shall need the following simple observation.

Suppose we have a zigzag path as shown in [\eqref=zigzag_path]. Fix ρ∈C. If

[formula]

then for every [formula] and [formula].

To go from [formula] to [formula] along the zigzag path, we need to pass through r arrows of type [formula] and r - 1 arrows of type [formula]. To go from [formula] to [formula] along the zigzag path, we need to pass through s arrows of type [formula] and s arrows of type [formula].

We keep track of how the Young diagram of [formula] changes as we move along the zigzag path. When we move along an arrow of type [formula], the number of boxes in a row of the Young diagram will not decrease and will increase by at most 1. When we move along an arrow of type [formula], the number of boxes in a row of the Young diagram will not increase and will decrease by at most 1. The inequalities follow.

We now prove Theorem [\ref=main_theorem].

Fix a non-negative integer m and set [formula] for each [formula]. Observe that: where ιn - m denotes the trivial representation of Gn - m. Let [formula] be the function defined by Then by [\cite=Zelevinsky] one has [formula].

Suppose [formula] is a function such that [formula]. Then one has:

[formula]

Let [formula] be the function such that [formula], and write [formula] as [formula]. Suppose that [formula] is an irreducible component of Vn. Then there exists a zigzag path from [formula] to [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lemma_inequalities], one has [formula] and [formula], so [formula]. Therefore, the function [formula] is well-defined. It suffices to prove that:

[formula]

{

To this end, define a map For any function [formula], define the function [formula] by [formula] and [formula] if ρ  ≠  ι. Note that [formula] and [formula]. Moreover, for any functions [formula] and [formula], if [formula] or [formula], then [formula] or [formula], respectively. Fix [formula] and define the map

[formula]

We claim that the map h is bijective. The injectivity of h is clear from the injectivity of [formula]. To see the surjectivity of h, note that the image of [formula] is the set of all partitions [formula] such that [formula]. Suppose we have a zigzag path Let us write [formula] and [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lemma_inequalities], we have: Since [formula] and [formula], it follows that: Hence, the zigzag path [formula] is in the image of h. The map h is thus bijective and we have proven [\eqref=equation_stability_of_multiplicities]. This completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=main_theorem].

Representation stability for VIC-modules

Notations

For any finite group G and representation π of G, we write πG for the quotient space of G-coinvariants of π.

Let n be any non-negative integer. For any non-negative integers m and r such that n = m + r, let Hm,r be the subgroup of Gn consisting of all matrices of the form:

[formula]

and 1m is the identity element of Gm and g22∈Gr. Let Lm,r be the subgroup of Hm,r consisting of all matrices g of the form [\eqref=matrix_g] such that g12 = 0.

For any non-negative integer m, we define a [formula]-module P(m) by that is, P(m) is the composition of the functor [formula] followed by the free [formula]-module functor.

Generalities

We recall some basic definitions on [formula]-modules.

A homomorphism F:U  →  V of [formula]-modules is a natural transformation from the functor U to the functor V. If U and V are [formula]-modules such that U(X) is a [formula]-submodule of V(X) for every object X of [formula], and the collection of inclusion maps [formula] defines a homomorphism U  →  V of [formula]-modules, then we say that U is a [formula]-submodule of V. A [formula]-module V is said to be generated by a subset [formula] if the only [formula]-submodule of V containing S is V; we say that V is finitely generated if it is generated by a finite subset S.

It is plain (see, for example, [\cite=GL-Noetherian]) that a [formula]-module V is finitely generated if and only if there exists a surjective homomorphism It is also easy to see that one has:

Let V be a [formula]-module and let {Vn,φn} be the consistent sequence obtained from V. Then V is finitely generated if and only if {Vn,φn} satisfies condition (RS2) and dim (Vn) <   ∞   for every n.

See [\cite=GL-Noetherian].

Let us mention that it was also shown in [\cite=PS] that if V is finitely generated, then {Vn,φn} satisfies condition (RS2).

Weak stability and weight boundedness

Suppose {Vn,φn} is a consistent sequence of representations of Gn.

For any non-negative integers n, m and r such that n = m + r, the map φn:Vn  →  Vn + 1 descends to a map

[formula]

We say that {Vn,φn} is:

weakly stable if for each [formula], there exists [formula] such that for each [formula], the map φm,r of ([\ref=map_on_coinvariants]) is bijective.

weight bounded if there exists a non-negative integer a such that for every [formula] and every irreducible subrepresentation [formula] of Vn, one has [formula].

The following key proposition is proved in [\cite=GW].

Let {Vn,φn} be a consistent sequence of representations of Gn. Suppose that {Vn,φn} is weakly stable and weight bounded. Then:

{Vn,φn} satisfies conditions (RS1) and (RS3).

If dim (Vn) <   ∞   for every [formula], then there exists a polynomial [formula] and an integer N such that dim (Vn)  =  P(qn) for all [formula].

(i) See [\cite=GW].

(ii) Immediate from condition (RS3) and [\cite=GW].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=stability_for_VIC_modules]

. We now prove Theorem [\ref=stability_for_VIC_modules].

Let V be a finitely generated [formula]-module and {Vn,φn} the consistent sequence obtained from V. By Proposition [\ref=fg_iff_RS2] and Proposition [\ref=RS1_and_RS3], it suffices to prove that {Vn,φn} is weakly stable and weight bounded. We need the following lemma.

For any non-negative integer m, the [formula]-module P(m) is weakly stable.

Write {P(m)n,φn} for the consistent sequence obtained from P(m).

Fix a non-negative integer [formula] and set [formula]. We shall prove that for [formula], the map is surjective. This would imply that [formula] is bijective for all r sufficiently large.

Observe that for [formula], the group Gn acts transitively on [formula] and Lm,n - m is the stabilizer of the pair (f,K) where f is the standard inclusion [formula] and K is the subspace of vectors in [formula] whose first m coordinates are 0. Hence, it suffices to prove that for [formula], the map induced by the standard inclusion [formula] is surjective. We shall prove the stronger statement that for [formula], the map is surjective. Thus, suppose that [formula] and choose any x∈Gn + 1. We need to show that for some [formula] and g'∈Lm,n + 1 - m, the only nonzero entry in the last row or last column of gxg' is the entry in position (n + 1,n + 1) and it is equal to 1.

First, we may choose [formula] and g'1∈Lm,n + 1 - m such that the entries of g1xg'1 in positions (i,j) are 0 if [formula] and [formula], or if [formula] and [formula]. Indeed, we may first perform row operations on the last r + 1 rows of x to change the entries in positions (i,j) to 0 for [formula] and [formula]; then, we may perform column operations on the last n + 1 - m columns to change the entries in positions (i,j) to 0 for [formula] and [formula]. Let x1  =  g1xg'1.

Next, since x1 has rank [formula], there exists [formula] such that the entry of x1 in position (i,j) is nonzero. By first interchanging row i with row n + 1, and then interchanging column j with column n + 1, we obtain a matrix whose entry in position (n + 1,n + 1) is nonzero. It is now easy to see that for some [formula] and g'2∈Lm,n + 1 - m, the matrix g2x1g'2 lies in Gn.

We can now prove that the consistent sequence {Vn,φn} is weakly stable. Since V is finitely generated, there is a surjective homomorphism P  →  V where P is a [formula]-module of the form [formula] for some [formula]. Let {Pn,φn} be the consistent sequence obtained from P. By Lemma [\ref=P_weakly_stable], {Pn,φn} is weakly stable. Fix [formula]. Then for all r sufficently large, the top horizontal map in the following commuting diagram is bijective: Since the two vertical maps in the above diagram are surjective, it follows that the bottom horizontal map is surjective for all r sufficiently large, and hence bijective for all r sufficiently large.

Since V is a quotient of [formula], to see that {Vn,φn} is weight bounded, it suffices to show that P(m) is weight bounded for each [formula]. As we noted in the proof of Lemma [\ref=P_weakly_stable], for each [formula], the Gn representation [formula] is isomorphic to the permutation representation of Gn on Gn / Lm,n - m. But Lm,n - m is conjugate to Gn - m in Gn. Therefore, the permutation representation of Gn on Gn / Lm,n - m is isomorphic to the permutation representation of Gn on Gn / Gn - m. We deduce from Theorem [\ref=main_theorem] that the consistent sequence obtained from P(m) is weight bounded. This completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=stability_for_VIC_modules].

Remarks

We end with some remarks on the connection of this paper to other works.

(i) It is a difficult result [\cite=PS] of Putman and Sam that any finitely generated [formula]-module over a noetherian ring is noetherian. An easier proof for finitely generated [formula]-modules over a field of characteristic zero is given in [\cite=GL-Noetherian]. It was shown in [\cite=GL-Noetherian] and [\cite=PS] that condition (RS1) is also a simple consequence of the noetherian property.

(ii) Let [formula] be the category whose objects are the finite dimensional vector spaces over [formula] and whose morphisms are the injective linear maps. In [\cite=GW], the authors proved a representation stability theorem for finitely generated [formula]-modules over [formula]. This result can also be deduced from Theorem [\ref=stability_for_VIC_modules]: there is a forgetful functor from the category [formula] to the category [formula], and the pullback of any finitely generated [formula]-module is a finitely generated [formula]-module; see [\cite=PS]. The proof of [\cite=GW], however, does not require the use of the branching rule (Fact [\ref=branching_rule_for_1_step]) for the finite general linear groups.

(iii) We should mention that the categories [formula] and [formula] are analogues of the category [formula] of finite sets and injective maps. [formula]-modules were introduced and studied by Church, Ellenberg and Farb in [\cite=CEF]. One of the main results of their paper is a representation stability theorem for finitely generated [formula]-modules over a field of characteristic zero. The proof of Proposition [\ref=RS1_and_RS3](i) (given in [\cite=GW]) is an adaptation of their arguments for consistent sequences of representations of the symmetric groups to our situation of consistent sequences for representations of the finite general linear groups.
