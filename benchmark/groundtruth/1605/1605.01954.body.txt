Observation estimate for kinetic transport equation by diffusion approximation

, Kim Dang Phung

Introduction

This article is devoted to the question of unique continuation for linear kinetic transport equation with a scattering operator in the diffusive limit. Let Ω be a bounded open subset of [formula], d> 1, with boundary ∂Ω of class C2. Consider in [formula] the transport equation in the v direction with a scattering operator S and absorbing boundary condition

[formula]

where [formula] is a small parameter and [formula] is a scattering opacity satisfying [formula]. Here, [formula] and [formula] where [formula] is the unit outward normal field at x∈∂Ω.

Two standard examples of scattering operators S are the following:

The neutron scattering operator:

The Fokker-Planck scattering operator:

Let ω be a nonempty open subset of Ω. Suppose we observe the solution f at time T > 0 and on ω, i.e. [formula] is known. A classical inverse problem consists to recover at least one solution, and in particular its initial data, which fits the observation on [formula]. Our problem of unique continuation is: With how many initial data, the corresponding solution achieves the given observation [formula]. Here ε is a small parameter and it is natural to focus on the limit solution. This is the diffusion approximation saying that the solution f converges to a solution of a parabolic equation when ε tends to 0 (see [\cite=B],[\cite=DL],[\cite=LK],[\cite=BR],[\cite=BGPS],[\cite=BSS],[\cite=BBGS]). In this framework, two remarks are in order:

For our scattering operator, there holds For the operator of neutron transport, one uses a standard energy method by multiplying both sides of the first line of ([\ref=1.1]) by f and integrating over [formula]. For the Fokker-Planck scattering operator, one combines the standard energy method as above and Poincaré inequality

In the sense of distributions in Ω, for any t  ≥  0, the average of f solves the following parabolic equation

[formula]

Indeed, multiply by [formula] the equation [formula] and take the average over [formula], using [formula], [formula] and [formula], one obtains for any t  ≥  0 and any [formula]Moreover, we prove that the boundary condition on 〈f〉 is small in some adequate norm with respect to ε. In the sequel, any estimates will be explicit with respect to ε.

Backward uniqueness for parabolic equation has a long history (see [\cite=DJP],[\cite=V]). Lions and Malgrange [\cite=LM] used the method of Carleman estimates. Later, Bardos and Tartar [\cite=BT] gave some improvements by using the log convexity method of Agmon and Nirenberg. More recently, motivated by control theory and inverse problems (see [\cite=I],[\cite=P]), Carleman estimates became an important tool to achieve an observability inequality (see [\cite=FI],[\cite=FZ],[\cite=FG],[\cite=LRL],[\cite=LeRR],[\cite=LRR]). In [\cite=PW], the desired observability inequality is deduced from the observation estimate at one point in time which is obtained by studying the frequency function in the spirit of log convexity method. In particular, one can quantify the following unique continuation property (see [\cite=EFV],[\cite=PWa]): If [formula] with [formula] and [formula] on ω, then [formula].

Our main result below involves the regularity of the nonzero initial data f0 measured in term of two quantities. Let p > 2,Observe in particular that [formula] is the most natural evaluation of the frequency of the velocity average of the initial data.

Suppose that [formula] and [formula] with Mp + F <  +   ∞   for some p > 2. Then the unique solution f of ([\ref=1.1]) satisfies for any T > 0 with [formula] and [formula] where c only depends on [formula].

By a direct application of our main result, we have:

Let [formula] and [formula] with Mp + F <  +   ∞   for some p > 2. Suppose that f0  ≥  0. Then there is [formula] depending on [formula] such that if [formula] on [formula] for some ε  ≤  ε0, then [formula].

This paper is organized as follows: The proof of the main result is given in the next section. It requires two important results: an approximation diffusion convergence of the average of f; an observation estimate at one point in time for the diffusion equation with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition. In Section 3, we prove the approximation theorem stated in Section 2. In Section 4, a direct proof of the observation inequality at one point in time for parabolic equations is proposed. Finally, in an appendix, we prove a backward estimate for the diffusion equation and a trace estimate for the kinetic transport equation.

Proof of main Theorem [\ref=theorem1.1]

The main task in the proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem1.1] consists on the two following propositions. Below we denote by [formula] any solution of the diffusion equation

[formula]

with [formula] and [formula].

There are C > 0 and [formula] such that any solution[formula] of ([\ref=2.1]) satisfies Here C and μ only depend on [formula].

As an immediate application, combining with the following backward estimate for diffusion equation

[formula]

we have:

For any nonzero [formula] solution of ([\ref=2.1]), one has where C only depends on [formula].

Assume [formula] for some p > 2 and consider [formula] solution of ([\ref=2.1]) with initial data [formula], then for any T > 0 and any [formula], the solution f of ([\ref=1.1]) satisfies where [formula] and C > 0 only depends on [formula].

The proof of Proposition [\ref=proposition2.1] and Proposition [\ref=proposition2.3] is given in section 4 and section 3 respectively.

In one hand, since [formula], we have by Corollary [\ref=corollary2.2]On the other hand, by regularizing effect, we haveTherefore, the two above facts yield where in the last line we used Proposition [\ref=proposition2.3]. This completes the proof.

Estimates for diffusion approximation

Below we give precise error estimates for the diffusion approximation.

Let [formula] such that [formula]. Assume [formula] for some p > 2 and consider [formula] solution of ([\ref=2.1]) with initial data [formula], then for any T > 0, the solution f of ([\ref=1.1]) satisfieswhere [formula] and C > 0 only depends on [formula] and [formula].

In the literature, there are at least two ways to get diffusion approximation estimates:

- Use a Hilbert expansion: The solution f of the transport problem can be formally written as f = f0  +  εf1  +  ε2f2 + ... and we substitute this expansion into the governing equations in order to prove existence of f0,f1,f2,.... Next we set [formula] and check that it solves a transport problem for which energy method can be used. This way requires well-prepared initial data that is f0  =  〈f0〉 to avoid initial layers.

- Use moment method: The zeroth and first moments of f are respectively 〈f〉 and 〈vf〉. First, we check that f - 〈f〉 is small in some adequate norm with respect to ε. Next by computing the zeroth and first moments of the equation solved by f (as it was done in the introduction), we derive that 〈f〉 solves a parabolic problem for which energy method can be used. This way and a new ε uniform estimate on the trace (see Proposition [\ref=proposition3.2] below) give Theorem [\ref=theorem3.1]. Notice that since only the average of f, is involved, the proof requires no analysis of the initial layer near t = 0.

If [formula] for some p > 2, then the solution f of ([\ref=1.1]) satisfies where [formula] and C > 0 only depends on [formula].

Proposition [\ref=proposition3.2] is proved in Appendix. The proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem3.1] starts as follows. Let wε  =  〈f〉 - u where u solves By ([\ref=1.2]) and a density argument, wε solves for any t  ≥  0 and any [formula]

[formula]

with boundary condition wε  =  〈f〉 on [formula] and initial data [formula]. We choose By integrations by parts, the identity ([\ref=3.1]) becomes:

[formula]

First, the contribution of the boundary data is estimate: One has, by a classical trace theorem where the constant C1 depends on [formula].

Secondly, the contribution of the term is estimated: By integration by parts and using [formula] on ∂Ω, one has which implies with some constant C1 > 0 depending on [formula].

Thirdly, the contribution of the term [formula] is estimated: From the identitiesand we see thatCombining the three above contributions with ([\ref=3.2]), one obtainsIntegrating the above over [formula], we observe with [formula] and wε  =  〈f〉 - u that Next, we use the trace estimate in Proposition [\ref=proposition3.2], and to get that This completes the proof.

Observation estimates for diffusion equation

In this section, we establish an observation estimate at one point in time for parabolic equations (see Theorem [\ref=theorem4.1] below). Such estimate is an interpolation inequality. Hölder type inequalities of such form already appear in [\cite=LR] for elliptic operators by Carleman inequalities. It applies to the observability for the heat equation in manifold and to the sum of eigenfunctions estimate of Lebeau-Robbiano. On the other hand, for parabolic operators, Escauriaza, Fernandez and Vessella proved such interpolation estimate far from the boundary by some adequate Carleman estimates [\cite=EFV]. Here our approach is completely new and uses properties of the heat kernel with a parametrix of order 0.

Let Ω be a bounded open set in [formula], n  ≥  1, either convex or C2 and connected. Let ω be a nonempty open subset of Ω, and T > 0. Let A be a n  ×  n symmetric positive-definite matrix with [formula] coefficients such that [formula]. There are c > 0 and [formula] such that any solution to satisfies Moreover, when A is time-independent, then [formula] where C and μ only depend on [formula].

Clearly, Proposition [\ref=proposition2.1] is a direct application of Theorem [\ref=theorem4.1]. The proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem4.1] uses covering argument and propagation of interpolation inequalities along a chain of balls (also called propagation of smallness): First we extend [formula] to a C2 function on [formula] denoted AT. Next, for each [formula] there are a neighborhood of x0 and a function [formula] on which the following four properties hold:

[formula] for some [formula] depending on [formula] ;

[formula] is C2 ;

[formula] ;

[formula] .

Here [formula] denotes the Hessian matrix and [formula] is the geodesic distance connecting x to x0. The proof of the above properties for [formula] is a consequence of Gauss's lemma for C2 metrics (see [\cite=IM]).

Now we are able to define the ball of center x0 and radius R as [formula]. We will choose x0∈Ω in order that one of the two following assumptions hold: (i) [formula] for any [formula]; (ii) [formula] and [formula] on [formula] for any [formula] where R0 > 0. Here ν is the unit outward normal vector to [formula].

The case [formula] deals with the propagation in the interior domain by a chain of balls strictly included in Ω. The analysis near the boundary ∂Ω requires the assumptions of [formula].

However when [formula] is a convex domain or a star-shaped domain with respect to x0∈Ω, we only need to propagate the estimate in the interior domain.

If further A = In, then [formula] and it is well defined for any x∈Ω. From [\cite=PW] such observation at one point in time implies the observability for the heat equation which from [\cite=AEWZ] is equivalent to the sum of eigenfunctions estimate of Lebeau-Robbiano type. Eventually a careful evaluation of the constants gives the following estimates (whose proof is omitted).

Suppose that [formula] is a convex domain or a star-shaped domain with respect to x0∈Ω such that [formula] for some r > 0. Then for any [formula], T > 0, [formula], μ  ≥  1, [formula], one hasandwhere C > 0 is a constant only depending on [formula]. Here [formula] denotes the eigenbasis of the Laplace operator with Dirichlet boundary condition.

In the next subsection, we state some preliminary lemmas and corollaries. In subsection 4.2, we prove Theorem [\ref=theorem4.1]. Subsection 4.3 is devoted to the proof of the preliminary results.

Preliminary results

In this subsection we present some lemmas and corollaries which will be used for the proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem4.1].

The following lemma allows to solve differential inequalities and makes appear the Hölder type of inequality in Theorem [\ref=theorem4.1].

Let T > 0, λ > 0 and [formula]. Consider two positive functions [formula] such that where C0,C1  ≥  0. Then for any 0  ≤  t1 < t2 < t3  ≤  T, one has where

Under the assumptions of Lemma 1, for any λ > 0 and [formula] such that [formula], one has where [formula], [formula] if C0 > 0 and [formula] if C0 = 0.

Proof .- Apply Lemma [\ref=lemma4.3] with t3 = T, [formula], [formula], with [formula]. Here when C0 > 0 And when C0 = 0

The following lemma establishes the differential inequalities associated to parabolic equations in any open set [formula]:

For any [formula], [formula], one hasand for some C only depending on [formula]

Let R > 0 be sufficiently small and [formula] with [formula]. Introduce for [formula], [formula],and whenever [formula]. Then, the following two properties hold:

Proof .- Apply Lemma [\ref=lemma4.5] with [formula] and It remains to bound [formula], [formula] and [formula]. First, one get Next, [formula] and imply where in the last equality we used [formula]. Finally, we haveOne conclude by choosing R > 0 sufficiently small in order the constant C0 in Corollary [\ref=corollary4.6] satisfies 0 < C0 < 1.

Remark .- When A is time-independent, then C1 = 0 in Corollary [\ref=corollary4.6].

The following lemma will be used to deal with the delocalized terms.

Let [formula] and 0 < ε  <  ρ / 2. There are constants c1,c2,c3 > 0 only depending on [formula] such that for any T - θ  ≤  t  ≤  T, one has where

The interested reader may wish here to compare this lemma with [\cite=EFV].

Proof of Theorem 4.1

Let λ > 0 and [formula] be such that [formula]. By Corollary [\ref=corollary4.4] with [formula], [formula] given in Corollary [\ref=corollary4.6], and knowing that [formula] from Corollary [\ref=corollary4.6], one can deduce the following interpolation inequality with [formula] and 0 < C0 < 1,that is From the definition of F1, Since [formula] for [formula] with [formula], one has when [formula] By Lemma [\ref=lemma4.7] with ρ = R - 2ε,Similarly, from the definition of F2, and then, when [formula] By Lemma [\ref=lemma4.7] with ρ = R - 2ε,where c > 1 is a constant only dependent on [formula]. We conclude that for any [formula]Therefore there is [formula] such that for any [formula] which impliesNow, we split [formula] into two parts: For any 0 < r < R / 2 such that [formula], Consequently, we haveNow, choose [formula] in order that [formula] (knowing that [formula] for [formula] and C0 < 1). Therefore there is K > 1 such that for any [formula] But by Lemma [\ref=lemma4.7] with ρ = R - 2ε, since [formula], As a consequence, for any [formula] one obtainOn the other hand, for any [formula], one has [formula]. And for any [formula], there holds [formula]. Finally, there is K > 1 such that for any λ > 0,Next, choose λ > 0 such that [formula] that is in order thatRecall that by Lemma [\ref=lemma4.7] with ρ = R - 2ε, Finally, we obtain for some positive constant K only depending on [formula]. By an adequate covering of Ω by balls BR - 4ε where x0 and R are chosen such that [formula] on [formula] and by a propagation of smallness based on the previous estimate, we get the desired observation inequality at one point in time for parabolic equations.

Proof of Lemma [\ref=lemma4.3]

We shall distinguish two cases: [formula]; [formula]. For t1  ≤  t  ≤  t2, we integrate [formula] over [formula] to get Then we solve [formula] with and integrate it over [formula] to obtain For t2  ≤  t  ≤  t3, we integrate [formula] over [formula] to get Then we solve [formula] with and integrate it over [formula] to obtain Finally, combining the case t1  ≤  t  ≤  t2 and the case t2  ≤  t  ≤  t3, we have withwhich is the desired estimate.

Proof of Lemma [\ref=lemma4.5]

The aim of this section is to prove the differential inequalities for parabolic equations stated in Lemma [\ref=lemma4.5]. For any [formula], a weak solution of [formula] with [formula], we apply the following formula with different functions φ: φ = zeξ, φ  =  ∂tzeξ and [formula]. Here ν is the unit outward normal vector to ∂ϑ and [formula] is a sufficiently smooth function which will be chosen later. When φ = zeξ, we have and When φ  =  ∂tzeξ, we havewhich impliesWe compute [formula] by taking [formula]: One has with standard summation notations and [formula] But by one integration by partsThe homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition on z implies [formula] on ∂ϑ. Therefore, one deducesNow, we are able to compute [formula]: One hasNotice that by Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, the contribution of the fourth and fifth terms of the above becomes Therefore, one conclude that

Proof of Lemma [\ref=lemma4.7]

Let 0 < ε  <  ρ / 2 and [formula] be such that 0  ≤  φ  ≤  1, φ = 1 on [formula]. We multiply the equation [formula] by [formula] where h > 0 and integrate over [formula]. We get by one integration by parts But, [formula]. Therefore, by Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, it follows that Thus, with the fact that [formula], one get for some constant CA > 0 Then we have, which givesLet T / 2 < T - δh  ≤  t  ≤  T, it yields Choose that is [formula] in order that [formula]. Therefore, we getwhere in the last line we used δh < max[formula]. Now, choose h such that both δh < max[formula] and With such choice, one hasand moreover,for any T / 2 < T - δh  ≤  t  ≤  T. Such h exists by choosing Clearly, δh < T / 2 and δh  ≤  1. We conclude that for any T / 2  ≤  T - θ  ≤  t  ≤  T with This completes the proof.

Remark .- When A is time-independent, then CA = 4max[formula].

Appendix

This appendix is devoted to the proof of Proposition [\ref=proposition3.2] and of inequality ([\ref=2.2]).

Trace estimate for f (proof of Proposition [\ref=proposition3.2])

Denote [formula]. First, multiplying both sides of the first line of ([\ref=1.1]) by [formula] and integrating over [formula], one has the following a priori estimate for any η  ≥  2Secondly, one uses Hölder inequality to get ButHence, as soon as p > 2, one get the desired estimate where [formula] and C > 0 only depends on [formula].

Backward estimate for diffusion equations (proof of ( [\ref=2.2]))

Classical energy identities for our parabolic equation are: where [formula] solves [formula] in Ω. Now, one can easily check with [formula] and [formula] that By solving such differential inequalities, one obtain which implies One conclude that
