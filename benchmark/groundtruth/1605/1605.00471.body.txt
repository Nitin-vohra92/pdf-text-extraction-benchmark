Introduction

The main object of our work is the so-called edge ideal I(G) of a (non-empty) finite simple graph G. It is defined by considering the polynomial ring R over a given field whose indeterminates are the vertices of G, and then taking the (squarefree monomial) ideal generated by the products xy such that {x,y} is an edge of G. This algebraic-combinatorial construction dates back to 1990: it appears for the first time in a paper by Villarreal [\cite=V90]. The corresponding theory was developed in 1994 by Simis, Vasconcelos and Villarreal [\cite=SVV], and, in the following years, by many other authors: an extensive overview of the results achieved can be found in [\cite=MV11]. The present paper deals with two algebraic invariants of I(G): the big height, denoted by bight  I(G), which is the maximum height of the minimal primes of I(G), and the arithmetical rank, denoted by ara  I(G), which is the minimum number of elements of R that generate an ideal whose radical is I(G) (we will say that these elements generate I(G) up to radical). As a consequence of Krull's Principal Ideal Theorem, the big height always provides a lower bound for the arithmetical rank. In our case, more precisely we have:

[formula]

where ht   and pd   denote the height and the projective dimension, respectively. These inequalities are strict, in general. In [\cite=BM2] we showed that, if G is a graph whose cycles are pairwise vertex-disjoint, then the difference between ara  I(G) and bight  I(G) is not greater than the number of cycles of G. This upper bound turns out to be sharp. In Theorem [\ref=thm_main] we will extend this result to all graphs whose cycles are pairwise edge-disjoint, i.e., have at most one vertex in common. These are known in the literature as cactus graphs. Our approach is inductive on the number of edges, exploits the main result in [\cite=M13b], and its proof is entirely independent of the one in [\cite=BM2]. We note that our Theorem [\ref=thm_main] gives a further generalization of the theorem by Kimura and Terai [\cite=KT13], according to which the arithmetical rank and the big height are equal for acyclic graphs (the so-called forests), and which, in turn, is a generalization of the main result in [\cite=B].

If in ([\ref=0]) equality holds everywhere, the ideal I(G) is called a set-theoretic complete intersection; in this case, the ideal is Cohen-Macaulay. On the other hand, there are many classes of edge ideals for which the converse is also true. Some of them are characterized by certain algebraic properties of I(G), such as, e.g., having height two [\cite=K] or having height equal to half the number of vertices [\cite=BM], whereas other results refer to the combinatorial features of G (see the bipartite graphs studied in [\cite=HH05] and in [\cite=EV97], which also belong to the aforementioned class). Here we will show that the edge ideal of a Cohen-Macaulay graph that is chordal or has no cycles of length 4 and 5 (Corollary [\ref=cor_chordal]), or contains exactly one cycle (Theorem [\ref=thm_1cycle]), is a set-theoretic complete intersection; our proofs are based on the combinatorial characterizations provided in [\cite=CCR15], [\cite=HHZ05] and [\cite=HMT15].

Another special case that is worth considering is the one where pd  R / I(G) = ara  I(G). This equality has been established for certain unmixed bipartite graphs [\cite=Ku09], for the graphs formed by one cycle or by two cycles having one vertex in common [\cite=BKMY12], for those formed by some cycles and lines having a common vertex [\cite=KM12], or those whose edge ideals are subject to certain algebraic constraints (see, e.g., [\cite=EOT10] and [\cite=KRT]).

A stronger condition is the equality between the arithmetical rank and the big height, which has been proven for acyclic graphs [\cite=KT13], for graphs formed by a single cycle and some terminal edges attached to some of its vertices (multiwhisker graphs on a cycle, see [\cite=M13b] or [\cite=M13c]), and for graphs in which every vertex belongs to a terminal edge (fully whiskered graphs, (see [\cite=M13a] or [\cite=M13c]). Further examples in this direction arise from our Corollary [\ref=cor_3] (graphs in which every cycle has length divisible by 3 and has all but two consecutive vertices of degree 2) and Proposition [\ref=prop_bubble] (graphs obtained by attaching, to each vertex of a given graph, a single edge or a cycle whose length is not congruent to 1 modulo 3). Both results, which could be considered as interesting for themselves, provide examples of set-theoretic complete intersections.

All the results proven in this paper hold on any field.

Preliminaries

We first introduce some graph-theoretical terminology and notation.

All graphs considered in this paper are simple, i.e., without multiple edges or loops. For a graph G, V(G) and E(G) will denote the set of vertices and the set of edges of G, respectively. Given two vertices x and y of G, we will say that x is a neighbour of y if the vertices x,y form an edge. By abuse of notation, this edge will be denoted by xy, with the same symbol used for the corresponding monomial of I(G). The vertex x will be called terminal if it has exactly one neighbour y; in this case the edge xy will be called terminal. For the remaining basic terminology about graphs we refer to [\cite=Ha].

A graph will always be identified with the set of its edges. In particular, if G and H are graphs, the union of G and H (denoted [formula]) will be the graph with vertex set [formula] and edge set [formula]. The graphs G and H will be called disjoint if so are their sets of edges. We will say that H is a subgraph of G if V(H)  ⊂  V(G) and E(H)  ⊂  E(G). In this case, [formula].

Let G be a graph. A subset C of its vertex set is called a vertex cover if all edges of G have a vertex in C. A vertex cover of G is called minimal if it does not properly contain any vertex cover of G. A minimal vertex cover of G is called maximum if it has maximum cardinality among the minimal vertex covers of G. The empty set is the maximum minimal vertex cover of any graph with no edges.

It is well known that the minimal vertex covers of G are the sets of generators of the minimal primes of I(G). Hence bight  I(G) is the cardinality of the maximum minimal vertex covers of G.

Let G be a graph, and H a subgraph of G. If C is a minimal vertex cover of G, we will say that the (possibly empty) set [formula] is the vertex cover induced by C on H.

Let G be a graph and x be one of its vertices. Let C be a minimal vertex cover of G such that x∉C. Then a neighbour y of x will be called redundant (in C) if all neighbours of y other than x belong to C.

Let C be a minimal vertex cover of G such that x∉C. Then there is a redundant neighbour y of x in C if and only if [formula] is a minimal vertex cover of [formula].

Let G be a graph and let G1 be a subgraph of G such that the vertex sets of G1 and [formula] have exactly one element x in common. Let C be a maximum minimal vertex cover of G. Let C1 be a maximum minimal vertex cover of G1, and suppose that x∈C1 for all choices of C1. Let D1 be the vertex cover induced by C on G1. Then |D1|  ≤  |C1|. If x∈C, equality holds.

If D1 is a minimal vertex cover of G1, the inequality is true. If it is not minimal, then minimality must be violated at x, and in particular x∈D1. Hence all neighbours of x in G1 belong to D1. But then [formula] is a minimal vertex cover of G1 (not containing x), so that, by assumption, [formula], i.e., |D1|  ≤  |C1|, as claimed. Now suppose that x∈C. If D2 is the vertex cover induced by C on [formula], then [formula], and D2 does not contain any vertex of G1 other than x. Note that [formula] is also a minimal vertex cover of G. Since C is maximum, we must have |D1|  ≥  |C1|, which provides the required equality.

Let G1 and G2 be graphs whose vertex sets have exactly one element x in common. Let C1 and C2 be maximum minimal vertex covers of G1 and G2, respectively. Suppose that Then [formula] is a maximum minimal vertex cover of [formula]. Moreover, in case (i), x belongs to all maximum minimal vertex covers of [formula]. In cases (ii) and (iii), C1 and C2 are disjoint.

Case (i) is Lemma 3.4 in [\cite=BM2]. Case (ii) is clear. Let us consider case (iii). Note that [formula] is a vertex cover of [formula]. It is minimal because minimality could only be violated at some neighbour y of x in C2, but this is not the case, because, by assumption, not all neighbours of y in G2 other than x belong to C2. By Lemma [\ref=lem_max] the vertex cover induced by any maximum minimal vertex cover C' of G on G1 has at most |C1| elements. The remaining elements of C' form a minimal vertex cover of a subgraph of G2, hence they cannot be more than |C2|. This implies that C is maximum.

On cactus graphs

In this section we present our main result. Its proof will be performed by induction on the number of edges, after splitting the given cactus graph in (full) subgraphs having exactly one vertex in common.

A cactus graph is a graph in which any two cycles have at most one vertex in common.

Let G be a connected graph and x be one of its vertices. We call a branch of G at x any maximal connected subgraph H of G such that x is one of its vertices and either

In case (i) and (ii) H will be called a 1-branch or a 2-branch, respectively.

Let G be a cactus graph, and let x be one of its vertices. Let H1 and H2 be distinct branches of G at x. Then [formula]. Moreover, if G is connected, it is the union of the branches of G at x.

Suppose for a contradiction that some vertex w of G, distinct from x, belongs to V(H1) and V(H2). Let [formula]. Then H is a connected subgraph of G having x as one of its vertices. Moreover, in each of H1 and H2 there is a path connecting x to w. Let [formula] and [formula] be the vertices of these paths, which we suppose simple, i.e., without self-intersections. Moreover, set

[formula]

First assume that s = t = 1. If H1 and H2 are both 1-branches at x, then y1 = z1 is the only neighbour of x in H. Thus the vertex x has degree 1 in H, against the maximality of H1 and H2.

Otherwise, if say H1 is a 2-branch at x, and x lies on the cycle Γ1 of H1, then there is a path from x to w whose second vertex is the neighbour y'1  ≠  y1 of x on Γ1: it is formed by xy'1 and a path connecting y'1 to w in [formula]. If y'1 is a vertex of H2, then it is a neighbour of x other than z1, so that H2 is a 2-branch. In this case H contains the cycle Γ1 and in H the vertex x has degree 2, which violates the maximality of H1 and H2. Thus y'1 is not a vertex of H2, so that (up to changing the name of y'1 to y1) we have s > 1. We thus may assume that s > 1 or t > 1, in which case the vertices [formula] form a cycle Γ in H. In order to produce the final contradiction it suffices to prove that in H the vertex x has degree 2, because this, once again, implies a violation of maximality. So suppose that in H the vertex x has degree greater than 2, i.e., it has a neighbour u other than y1 and z1. Then, up to a change of indices, we may assume that u is a vertex of H1. Thus H1 is a 2-branch and u lies on the cycle Γ1. Now, since Γ1 and Γ have the vertices u and x in common, they must coincide. But then u is a neighbour of x in Γ, i.e., u∈{y1,z1}, against our assumption. This completes the proof of the first part of the claim.

Now suppose that G is connected and let uv be an edge of G. We show that it belongs to some branch of G at x. This is clear if x = u. So assume that x  ≠  u. Then there is a simple path [formula], in which x  ≠  z1. If xz1 is contained in some cycle, then uv belongs to a 2-branch of G at x, which is the maximal connected subgraph of G that contains this cycle and in which x has degree 2. Otherwise it belongs to a 1-branch of G at x, namely the maximal connected subgraph of G that contains xz1 and in which x has degree 1.

Let G be a cactus graph and let n be the number of its cycles. Then ara  I(G)  ≤  bight  I(G) + n.

The claim is trivial if G consists of one single edge. So assume that |E(G)|  ≥  2 and the claim is true for cactus graphs having a smaller number of edges. Since the arithmetical rank, the big height and the number of cycles are additive on connected components, we may assume that G is connected. As remarked at the beginning of the proof of Theorem 4.8 in [\cite=BM2], we may assume that all vertices lying on a cycle of G have degree greater than 2: in view of Lemma 3.1 in [\cite=BM2], each time a cycle of a graph is opened at a vertex of degree 2, the arithmetical rank of the edge ideal does not decrease, whereas its big height increases at most by one, so that the required upper bound remains unchanged. Moreover, if all vertices of G belong to some terminal edge, then the claim is true, since in [\cite=M13b] (see Corollary 1 and Remark 3), it was proven that in this case ara  I(G) = bight  I(G) (G is a fully whiskered graph). So suppose that G has a vertex x that does not belong to any terminal edge. Let G2 be one of the branches of G at x, and let [formula]. Then, by assumption, G1 is not empty, G2 is not a single edge and, by Lemma [\ref=lem_branch], G1 and G2 have only the vertex x in common. If G2 is a 1-branch, let y1 be the only neighbour of x in G2, if G2 is a 2-branch, let y1 and y2 be the neighbours of x in G2. Let C1 and C2 be maximum minimal vertex covers of G1 and G2, respectively, and, for i = 1,2, let bi  =  |Ci|, and let ni be the number of cycles in Gi, so that n = n1 + n2. Let b be the cardinality of any maximum minimal vertex cover of G. We distinguish several cases.

Case 1 First suppose that x∈C1 for all choices of C1.

Case 1.1 If x∈C2 for all choices of C2, then, by Lemma [\ref=lem_covers] (i), [formula] is a maximum minimal vertex cover of G and thus b = b1 + b2 - 1. If G2 is a 1-branch, set [formula], otherwise set [formula]. Let C'1 be a maximum minimal vertex cover of G'1, and set b'1  =  |C'1|. Moreover, if G2 is a 1-branch, let [formula] (which has n2 cycles), otherwise set [formula] (which has n2 - 1 cycles), so that, in both cases, G is the disjoint union of G'1 and [formula]. Let [formula] be a maximum minimal vertex cover of [formula], and set [formula]. Note that [formula] is not empty.

First suppose that G2 is a 1-branch. Then, in view of Lemma 3.2 in [\cite=BM2], b'1 = b1. If [formula], then [formula] is a minimal vertex cover of G2 (not maximum because [formula]), otherwise so is [formula]. Hence, in any case, [formula] Induction applies to G'1 and [formula]. Thus

[formula]

[formula]

as was to be proved.

Now suppose that G2 is a 2-branch. Let D1 be the vertex cover induced by C'1 on G1. If x∈C'1, then none of y1 and y2 belongs to C'1, so that C'1 = D1. Hence, by Lemma [\ref=lem_max], we have |C'1|  =  |C1|, i.e., b'1 = b1. In this case C1, that is always a minimal vertex cover of G'1, is also maximum. So assume that it is not maximum. Then x∉C'1, and we must have [formula], with |D1|  ≥  b1 - 1. Note that D1 is a minimal vertex cover of G1, but, since x∉D1, it is not maximum. Thus |D1|  =  b1 - 1, so that in this case b'1  =  b1 + 1. In any case b'1  ≤  b1 + 1.

If [formula], then [formula] is a minimal vertex cover of G2 (not maximum because [formula]), otherwise so is [formula]. Hence, in any case, [formula] Induction applies to G'1 and [formula]. Thus

[formula]

as was to be proved.

Case 1.2 Now suppose that, for some choice of C2, x∉C2, whence y1∈C2 if G2 is a 1-branch, and y1,y2∈C2 if G2 is a 2-branch.

a) First assume that for one of these choices, there are no redundant neighbours of x in C2. In this case, by Lemma [\ref=lem_covers] (iii), [formula] is a maximum minimal vertex cover of G. Since |C| = b1 + b2, the claim follows by induction applied to G1 and G2.

b) Now assume that for all choices of C2 such that x∉C2, x has some redundant neighbour in C2. We first show that, in this case,

[formula]

Let C be a maximum minimal vertex cover of G. If x∈C, according to Lemma [\ref=lem_max], the cover C1 induced on G1 has exactly b1 elements. Let D2 be the cover induced by C on [formula]. Then [formula], where the union is disjoint, and, if yi∈D2, then yi is a non-redundant neighbour of x in D2. If all available yi belong to D2, then D2 is a minimal vertex cover of G2, not maximum by assumption. Hence |D2|  ≤  b2 - 1. Otherwise [formula] is a minimal vertex cover of G2, whence again |D2|  ≤  b2 - 1. Thus |C|  ≤  b1 + b2 - 1. Now suppose that x∉C. Then the cover D1 induced on G1 has at most b1 - 1 elements, whereas the cover D2 induced on G2 (equivalently, on [formula]), has at most b2 elements. Thus, [formula], where the union is disjoint, and once again, b = |C|  =  |D1|  +  |D2|  ≤  b1 + b2 - 1. This completes the proof of ([\ref=bb1b2]).

Next suppose that G2 is a 1-branch. If [formula], then [formula] is a minimal vertex cover of G2, otherwise so is [formula], but it cannot be maximum, because in it y1 is a non-redundant neighbour of x. Hence [formula].

Now suppose that G2 is a 2-branch. If [formula] or [formula], then [formula] is a minimal vertex cover of G2, otherwise so is [formula], but it cannot be maximum, because in it y1 and y2 are both non-redundant neighbours of x. Hence we always have [formula].

If, for some choice of C2, y1 is the only redundant neighbour of x in C2 (which is certainly true if G2 is a 1-branch), then a maximum minimal vertex cover of G is [formula], of cardinality b = b1 + b2 - 1. Since the bound on b'1 is unchanged, the claim thus follows as in ([\ref=1]) and ([\ref=2]), by induction on G'1 and [formula].

Finally assume that G2 is a 2-branch and, for all choices of C2 such that x∉C2, both y1 and y2 are redundant neighbours of x. Now, recall that b'1  ≤  b1 + 1. Moreover,

[formula] is a minimal vertex cover of G2 if one of y1 and y2 does not belong to [formula];

[formula] is a minimal vertex cover of G2, but not maximum, if y1 and y2 both belong to [formula].

In any case, [formula]. Hence, if b = b1 + b2 - 1, the claim follows as above by induction on G'1 and [formula].

So assume that b < b1 + b2 - 1. Note that a minimal vertex cover of G can be obtained by taking [formula]. Thus b = b1 + b2 - 2. We also have that no minimal vertex cover of [formula] has cardinality b2 - 1: if there were such a cover [formula], then [formula] would be a minimal vertex cover of G of cardinality b1 + b2 - 1, against our present assumption. Hence [formula]. Thus induction on G'1 and [formula] yields

[formula]

Case 2 Suppose that, for some choice of C1, x∉C1. If x∉C2 for some choice of C2, then, by Lemma [\ref=lem_covers] (ii), [formula] is a maximum minimal vertex cover of G, so that b = b1 + b2, and the claim easily follows by induction on G1 and G2. So assume that x∈C2 for all choices of C2.

Perform the following construction, starting at K = G2.

Add to G2 all branches H of G at x such that x belongs to every maximum minimal vertex cover of H (then, by Lemma [\ref=lem_covers] (i), the same is true for all maximum minimal vertex covers of the resulting graph K);

continue adding branches of G at x as long as x belongs to every maximum minimal cover of the initial graph K;

add the remaining branches of G at x, and call K the resulting graph.

Note that, by assumption, no branch of G at x is a single edge. Each time a branch is added in step 1, induction applies to K and H as to G1 and G2 in Case 1.1. Note that each branch added after step 1 has a maximum minimal vertex cover to which x does not belong. Each time step 2 is performed, induction applies as in Case 1.2, with K and H playing the roles of G1 and G2 respectively. Each time step 3 is performed on the graph K, induction applies to K and H as at the beginning of Case 2. Finally observe that, in view of Lemma [\ref=lem_branch], the algorithm always ends with K = G.

Some special cases

The examples presented in the final section of [\cite=BM2] show that the bound given in Theorem [\ref=thm_main] is sharp, in general. Equality holds, in particular, for acyclic graphs, which was shown for the first time in [\cite=KT13]. On the other hand, it is also true that in many cases our bound can be improved. We give some classes of cactus graphs of this kind.

The next result is a consequence of our main theorem.

Let G be a cactus graph and let n be the number of its cycles. Suppose that k cycles are of length divisible by 3, and each of them has all but two consecutive vertices of degree 2. Then

[formula]

We proceed by induction on k. If k = 0, then the claim follows directly from Theorem [\ref=thm_main]. So assume that [formula] and the claim is true for all cactus graphs fulfilling the assumption with k replaced by k - 1. Let Γ be a cycle of G of length s divisible by 3. Call [formula] its consecutive vertices and suppose that the first s - 2 have degree 2. Then let G' be the graph obtained from G by adding a new vertex y and replacing the edge xsx1 with xsy. This operation opens the cycle Γ, but leaves the other cycles of G unchanged. Then G' has n - 1 cycles, k - 1 of which fulfil the assumption. Thus induction applies to G', whence

[formula]

Note that G can be recovered from G' by identifying x1 and y. This implies that ara  I(G)  ≤  ara  I(G'). Thus it suffices to prove that bight  I(G')  ≤  bight  I(G). Let C' be a maximum minimal vertex cover of G'. We show that G has a minimal vertex cover C such that |C'|  ≤  |C|. Consider the subgraph induced by G' (and G) on the set [formula], and the cover D induced on it by C'; by assumption D is a vertex cover of the path on the vertices [formula], minimal if and only if s = 3 and x1∉C', or s  ≥  6 and [formula]. If s  ≥  6, a maximum minimal vertex cover of this path is the set D1 formed by x2,x4 and the following vertices of W (if any such exist) having index congruent to 1 or 2 modulo 3; we can also take D2, the set formed by x1,x3 and the following vertices of W (if any such exist) having index congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 3. In both cases we pick 2 vertices and 2 out of 3 from the s - 6 vertices [formula], hence the total number of vertices is [formula], which is the big height of the edge ideal of the path on s - 2 vertices if s is divisible by 3 (see, e.g., Corollary 3.0.3 in [\cite=M13c]). If s = 3, we set [formula]. If D is minimal, |D|  ≤  |D1|  =  |D2|. Now set [formula]. Since y is a terminal vertex of G', exactly one of y and xs belongs to E. Hence E = {xs} or E = {xs - 1,y} or E = {xs - 1,xs}. In the first case (which is the only possible if D is not minimal), the minimality of C' is not violated when x1 and y are identified, so that we can take C = C'. In the second case, we can take [formula] (after replacing y with x1). In the third case we can take [formula] if xs is not a redundant neighbour of y in C'. Otherwise, in C' we can replace xs with y, which takes us back to the second case. We thus always have |C'|  ≤  |C|, as desired.

The next propositions are applications of results contained in other papers.

In [\cite=M13b] the second author considers the following construction. Given a graph G on n vertices [formula], one introduces n new vertices [formula] and sets [formula]; G' is called the whisker graph on G, and is a special type of fully whiskered graph. The edge xiyi is called the whisker at xi. In the same paper (Proposition 2 and Remark 3) it is shown that ara  I(G') = ht  I(G') = n, so that I(G') is a set-theoretic complete intersection. We now generalize this result.

We consider n cycles/edges [formula] on pairwise disjoint vertex sets, such that, for all [formula], [formula]. We will say that Hi is attached to the vertex xi. We then set [formula]. This is, indeed, a natural generalization of the whisker graph G' on G.

Please note that the graphs referred to by the next proposition are not always cactus graphs.

Let G be a graph and [formula] be the graph obtained by attaching a cycle or a whisker to each of its vertices. Suppose that m is the number of these cycles whose length is congruent to 1 modulo 3. Then

[formula]

In particular, if m = 0, then [formula]. Moreover, if every attached cycle has length 3 or 5, then [formula] is a set-theoretic complete intersection.

We will refer to the notation introduced above. For all [formula], let yi be a neighbour of xi in Hi. Then [formula] is the whisker graph on G. We know that ara  I(G') = ht  I(G') = n. Let S0 be a set of n polynomials of R such that the radical of the ideal J0 = (S0) is I(G'). Then, in particular, [formula], for all [formula].

For all [formula] let ai  =  ara  I(Hi) and bi  =  bight  I(Hi). We know from [\cite=M13c], Corollary 3.0.5, that ai = bi + 1 if Hi is a cycle of length congruent to 1 modulo 3, otherwise ai = bi (= 1 if Hi is a whisker). In both cases, according to [\cite=BKMY12], Section 2, we can complete the monomial xiyi to a set of ai polynomials that generate an ideal Ji whose radical is I(Hi); let Si be the set of additional ai - 1 polynomials. Let [formula]. Then J has the same radical as the ideal generated by [formula], which admits a set of [formula] generators. But the radical of J is [formula]. Thus [formula].

On the other hand, if C' is a maximum minimal vertex cover of G', then |C'| = n and, for all [formula], exactly one of xi and yi belongs to C'. This vertex can be completed to a maximum minimal vertex cover Ci of Hi (by adding bi - 1 vertices). Then [formula] is a minimal vertex cover of [formula], so that [formula]. Finally, assume that [formula] are the cycles whose lengths are congruent to 1 modulo 3. We then have

[formula]

which shows the first part of the claim. Now, if each Hi is a whisker or a cycle of length 3 or 5, then m = 0 and, according to [\cite=KMY10], Corollary 2.6, [formula], so that [formula].

Recall that a graph G is called Cohen-Macaulay if so is its edge ideal on every field. In this case, the ideal I(G) is pure. Moreover, G is always Cohen-Macaulay if I(G) is a set-theoretic complete intersection. It is natural to ask if the converse is true. In the sequel, we will give several results which provide supporting evidence for a positive answer, especially in the case of cactus graphs.

Recall that a vertex of a graph G is called simplicial if its neighbours are pairwise adjacent in G. A maximal complete subgraph of G is called a simplex if it contains at least one simplicial vertex of G.

Let G be a chordal graph or a graph that does not have, among its subgraphs, any cycle of length 4 or 5. Then the following conditions are equivalent:

I(G) is pure,

G is Cohen-Macaulay,

every vertex of G belongs to exactly one simplex of G,

I(G) is a set-theoretic complete intersection.

The implications (d) ⇒   (b) ⇒   (a) are well-known. If (c) is true, then, with the terminology used in [\cite=M13b], G is a so-called fully clique-whiskered graph, and (d) follows by Proposition 2 in [\cite=M13b]. Finally, implication (a) ⇒   (c) follows from the Theorem in [\cite=HHZ05] if G is chordal and from Corollary 2.8 in [\cite=HMT15] if G has no cycles of length 4 and 5.

The case of unicyclic graphs

In this section we prove that the edge ideal of a Cohen-Macaulay graph having exactly one cycle is a set-theoretic complete intersection. We will use the following combinatorial classification of these graphs, which is due to Castrillón, Cruz and Reyes (see Theorem 6.10 and Corollary 6.11 in [\cite=CCR15]).

A connected graph G containing exactly one cycle Γ is Cohen-Macaulay if and only if it satisfies one of the following conditions:

G = Γ and has length 3 or 5;

G is a whisker graph;

Γ has length 3, has some vertex of degree 2, and the subgraph induced on [formula] is a disjoint union of whisker trees and single edges;

Γ has length 5, has no adjacent vertices of degree greater than 2, and the subgraph induced on [formula] is a disjoint union of whisker trees and single edges;

Γ has length 4, has two adjacent vertices of degree 2, and [formula], where H1 and H2 are non-empty graphs attached to the remaining two vertices, such that [formula] is a whisker tree.

We recall that the set-theoretic complete intersection property is true in case 1) by [\cite=BKMY12], Corollary 1. In case 2) it follows from [\cite=M13b], Proposition 3 and Remark 3. In case 3) it is a consequence of Corollary [\ref=cor_3]. The proof for the remaining two cases will be performed in several steps.

We need to recall two technical facts about the sets of polynomials that generate a monomial ideal up to radical:

Fact (i) is the main idea behind a famous result by Schmitt and Vogel (see the Lemma in [\cite=SV79]). Fact (ii) is part of the proof of Proposition 3 in [\cite=M13b], which is based on the construction presented in the proof of Theorem 1 in [\cite=K09].

Let Γ5 be the cycle on the consecutive vertices x1,x2,x3,x4,x5. The graph G' considered in the second of the following two lemmas is the one presented in part 4) of Theorem [\ref=thm_CM]. The graph G considered in the first lemma is a special case of it. In particular, I(G) and I(G') are pure.

For some nonnegative integers r,s, let [formula] and [formula] be paths of length 2 attached to the vertices x1 and x3 of Γ5, respectively, and let G be the union of Γ5, [formula] and [formula]. Then ara  I(G) = ht  I(G) = r + s + 3. In particular, I(G) is a set-theoretic complete intersection.

For all [formula] let x1,ai,bi be the consecutive vertices of Hi, and for all [formula], let x3,ci,di be the consecutive vertices of Ki. A maximum minimal vertex cover of G is [formula]. We show that I(G) can be generated up to radical by r + s + 3 elements. We first present some special cases.

From Proposition 1 (c) in [\cite=BKMY12] we know that

[formula]

which proves the claim for r = s = 0. Now suppose that r  ≥  1, and, for all [formula], set hi = x1ai + 1 + aibi. Note that, by (i), for [formula], the monomials x1ai, and for [formula], the monomials aibi belong to [formula]. Hence, from (i) it follows that

[formula]

which shows the claim for s = 0. Finally, suppose that s  ≥  1 and for all [formula], set ki = x3ci + 1 + cidi. Then set

[formula]

and consider the ideal [formula]. From (i) one deduces that for all [formula], the monomials x3ci, cidi and the monomial x3x4 belong to [formula]. Moreover,

[formula]

which, together with [formula], and, in view of (i), yields [formula]. Thus [formula], which, similarly, implies that [formula]. It then easily follows from (i) that

[formula]

which completes the proof of the claim.

Let G be the graph in Lemma [\ref=lem_5cycle].

Let G' be the graph obtained from G by attaching some graphs Li to x1 and/or some graphs Mi to x3 where, for all i, the subgraph [formula] induced by Li on [formula] and the subgraph [formula] induced by Mi on [formula] are whisker trees. Then I(G') is a set-theoretic complete intersection.

Fix an index i and set L = Li. Since [formula] is connected acyclic and is not reduced to a single edge, x1 has in [formula] only one neighbour e = ei, which has some neighbour f  ≠  x1 that is not a terminal vertex. Let H be the path formed by x1,e,f. By Lemma [\ref=lem_5cycle], [formula] is a set-theoretic complete intersection. We show that this property also holds for [formula], i.e., it is preserved when the edge ef is completed to [formula]. As was observed in the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem_5cycle], a maximum minimal vertex cover of [formula] is [formula], which induces on H the cover {x1,f}. On the other hand, a maximum minimal vertex cover of [formula] is the set [formula] of all its non-terminal vertices (among which is f). Then [formula] is a minimal vertex cover of [formula]. Since [formula], [formula]. We know that [formula] is a set-theoretic complete intersection. First assume that e is not a terminal vertex of [formula]. Then, in view of (ii), there exist [formula] such that [formula] On the other hand there are [formula] such that [formula]. Since [formula], it follows that

[formula]

which proves the claim in this case. Repeat the above construction for all graphs L = Li such that ei is not a terminal vertex of [formula] (say, for all [formula]) and for all graphs Mi in which the only neighbour gi of x3 is not a terminal vertex of [formula] (say, for all [formula]). This will produce a graph G1 with a maximum minimal vertex cover containing

[formula]

We obtain a new maximum minimal vertex cover C1 if we replace

[formula]

Now suppose that e is a terminal vertex of [formula] (i.e., ef is the whisker attached to f). In [formula] replace each non-terminal neighbour of f (i.e., each neighbour of f other than e) with the endpoint of the whisker attached to it. This yields a new maximum minimal vertex cover of [formula]: note that, since [formula] is acyclic, no two neighbours of f are adjacent, so that minimality is preserved. Then add the vertex e: in this way we obtain a minimal vertex cover D of L, which is maximum by Lemma 3.2 in [\cite=BM2]. Then the disjoint union [formula] is a minimal vertex cover of [formula]. Now, since L is a tree, I(L) is generated up to radical by |D| elements. Thus [formula] is generated up to radical by |C1|  +  |D| elements, which completes the proof of the set-theoretic complete intersection property for [formula]. An iteration of the previous construction yields the claim for G'.

Let Γ4 be the cycle on the consecutive vertices x1,x2,x3,x4. The graph G in the following lemma is the one described in case 5) of Theorem [\ref=thm_CM].

For i = 1,2 let Hi be a non-empty tree attached to the vertex xi of Γ4 and suppose that [formula] is a whisker tree. Let [formula]. Then I(G) is a set-theoretic complete intersection.

First of all note that, in view of (i), the set S0  =  {x1x2,x1x4 + x2x3,x3x4 + x1y1 + x2y2} generates the edge ideal of [formula] up to radical. Set [formula].

Fix an index i. Then Hi is either a single edge xiyi or a whisker tree. In the latter case xi has in Hi some non-terminal neighbour yi (since in a whisker graph no vertex is adjacent to more than one terminal vertex). If Hi is a single edge, then Ci  =  {xi} is a minimal vertex cover of Hi. Otherwise a (maximum) minimal vertex cover Ci of Hi consists of all non-terminal vertices of Hi. Note that in this case xi is not a terminal vertex in Hi: otherwise it would be the whisker at yi in Hi, but then yi would not have any whisker in H, where xi is not a terminal vertex. Thus xiyi is not a terminal vertex of Hi.

In any case, the set [formula] is a minimal vertex cover of G. Now, in view of (ii), there is a set Si of |Ci| - 1 polynomials such that [formula] (this is trivially true if Hi is a single edge, with [formula]). In view of (i), we thus have that [formula], where |S0|  +  |S1|  +  |S2|  =  |C1|  +  |C2| + 1, which proves the claim.

We have thus completed the proof of the announced result.

Let G be a Cohen-Macaulay graph with exactly one cycle. Then I(G) is a set-theoretic complete intersection.

Final Remarks

The assumptions of Corollary [\ref=cor_chordal] could suggest that the presence of minimal cycles of length 4 or 5 may in general provide an obstruction to the set-theoretic complete intersection property in the Cohen-Macaulay case, in the same way in which it sometimes prevents to improve the bound given in Theorem [\ref=thm_main] (which, in fact, is what occurs in the example presented at the end of [\cite=BM2]). Also the next result, while strongly enforcing the idea that Cohen-Macaulayness is "close" to set-theoretic complete intersection, clearly hints at this kind of obstruction.

Let G be a connected graph, which is not a single edge nor a cycle of length 7, and has no minimal cycles of length less than 6. Then the following conditions are equivalent:

I(G) is pure,

G is a whisker graph,

G is Cohen-Macaulay,

I(G) is a set-theoretic complete intersection.

The equivalence (a) ⇔   (b) is Corollary 5 in [\cite=FHN93]. Moreover, (b) ⇒   (d) follows from [\cite=M13b] Proposition 3. The implications (d) ⇒   (c) and (c) ⇒   (a) are well known.
