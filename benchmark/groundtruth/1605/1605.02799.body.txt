Klein tunneling and magnetoresistance of p-n junctions in Weyl semimetals

A theory of low temperature resistance and magnetoresistance (MR) of p-n junctions in conventional semiconductors was developed long ago [\cite=keldysh] [\cite=Haering] [\cite=Aronov]. The junction conductance is determined by tunneling processes of electrons between the conduction and valence bands in the presence of the built-in electric field of the junction. In this case the MR is positive, and becomes exponentially large at strong magnetic fields B. Two- and one-dimensional p-n junctions in semiconductors with a gapless Dirac spectrum [formula] (v is the velocity of electrons) can be realized in graphene [\cite=Cheianov] [\cite=Levitov] [\cite=Fogler], armchair carbon nanotubes [\cite=Anton] [\cite=WeiChen] and on the surface of topological insulators [\cite=ShouchengZhang]. The main difference with conventional semiconductors is that in the gapless case the junction conductance is dominated by Klein tunneling; electrons near normal incidence are transmitted through the junction without backscattering. As a result, at B = 0 the conductance of a graphene p-n junction is proportional to the square root of the built-in electric field E of the junction, [formula]. Here W is the width of the junction and [formula] is the characteristic length determined by the built-in electric field E. In a finite magnetic field perpendicular to the graphene sheet the MR of the junction is positive [\cite=Levitov] and becomes exponentially large at large B.

Recently a new class of three-dimensional materials (Weyl semimetals) was discovered [\cite=TurnerVishwanath] [\cite=BurkovBalents] [\cite=HalaszBalents] [\cite=BurkovHookBalents] [\cite=VafekVishwanath] [\cite=Qiang_Li_Kharzeev] [\cite=JunXiong_Ong] [\cite=Jun_Xiong] [\cite=Hasan] [\cite=Xiaojun_Yang] [\cite=Cai-ZhenLi] [\cite=ChenZangEnzeZhangYanwenLiu] [\cite=Drezden], in which dynamics of low energy electrons in valley i may be described by a gapless Dirac Hamiltonian

[formula]

Here χi  =    ±  1 is the valley chirality, [formula] are the Pauli matrices, [formula] is the momentum measured from the Weyl node, Δi is the energy offset of the Weyl node from the chemical potential in an undoped crystal, and [formula] is the potential energy. Due to the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem [\cite=NielsonNyninomiya] the number of the Weyl nodes, g, in the Brillouin zone must be even, and the number of opposite chirality nodes should be equal. The stability of the Weyl nodes is related to the fact that the flux of Berry curvature through a closed surface surrounding the node is quantized. Since the time reversal symmetry requires the Berry curvature to be an odd function of momentum and inversion symmetry requires it to be even, Weyl nodes can only exist in crystals with either broken inversion or time reversal symmetry. In the former case the minimal number of Weyl nodes is four, while in the latter case it is two. An interesting property of Weyl fermions is the existence of chiral (zeroth) Landau levels in a magnetic field. This feature is related to the chiral anomaly [\cite=Adler] [\cite=Jackiw] [\cite=NielsonNyninomiya] and leads to a strong anisotropic MR [\cite=NielsonNyninomiya] [\cite=SonSpivak] [\cite=SpivakAnton] in these materials. In this paper we study the conductance and magnetoconductance of a p-n junction in a Weyl semimetal. We show that the interplay between the chiral anomaly and and Klein tunneling results in negative MR of the junction.

The specific geometry of the junction is shown in the inset of Fig. [\ref=fig:electricpotential]. Doping in the p- and n- regions creates a built-in electrostatic potential U(z). Similar to graphene p-n junctions [\cite=Cheianov] the probability of Klein tunneling in valley i is determined by the value of the built-in electric field Ei at the crossing points, zi, where the electrochemical potential crosses the Weyl node, i.e. U(zi)  +  Δi = 0, see Fig. [\ref=fig:electricpotential]. Therefore we start by expressing the conductance in terms of the electric fields Ei at the crossing points and then evaluate these fields by solving the corresponding nonlinear screening problem.

Conductance at zero magnetic field. Let us consider transmission of an electron at the Fermi level across the junction. For an electron in valley i with momentum parallel to the junction plane, [formula], the transmission coefficient may be determined by solving an one-dimensional Dirac equation,

[formula]

Here the complex wavenumber [formula] parameterizes the conserved momentum parallel to the junction plane. We will assume that the dimensionless coupling constant [formula] is small. In this case, in the region relevant for Klein tunneling, which is of order [formula] near the crossing points, the potential can be approximated by U(z) + Δi =  - eEi(z - zi). In such case the transmission coefficient is well known

[formula]

This result may be understood from a semiclassical consideration. For a given [formula] the value of the z-component of the electron momentum is dictated by energy conservation, [formula], which yields the stopping points [formula]. The transmission coefficient is determined by the imaginary part of the action of the tunneling trajectory accumulated in the classically forbidden region between the stopping points, [formula]. This coincides with the exact result, Eq. ([\ref=eq:T_p]), according to which only electrons with small parallel momenta, [formula], have an appreciable transmission probability.

Substituting Eq. ([\ref=eq:T_p]) into the Landauer formula and summing over valleys and [formula], we obtain the conductance of the junction

[formula]

where S is the area of the junction.

Magnetoconductance. Next we consider the magnetic field dependence of the junction conductance G(B) at zero temperature for a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the junction. In the vicinity of the crossing points the electron Hamiltonian has the form [formula]. Using the Landau gauge for the vector potential, [formula], we look for the energy eigenstates in the form ψT = eikyy(u(x,z),v(x,z)). The spinor amplitudes u and v satisfy the Dirac equation

[formula]

with [formula] being the magnetic length and x0 = kyl2B. The solutions have the form [formula], where φn(x) are wavefunctions of the n-th Landau level. The amplitudes ũ and ṽ obey the differential equation

[formula]

Note that in addition to "conventional" Landau levels there is one chiral, n = 0, Landau level (in this case ũn - 1 = 0). Since Eq. ([\ref=eq:tildehamiltonian]) coincides with Eq. ([\ref=eq:Dirac_1D]) for a quantized value of the parallel momentum, [formula], the transmission coefficient for the n-th Landau level may be obtained by substituting [formula] in Eq. ([\ref=eq:T_p]).

[formula]

Substituting Eq. ([\ref=eq:T_B]) into the Landauer formula, summing over the Landau levels and accounting for their degeneracy, S / (2πl2B), we get the magnetic field dependence of the conductance

[formula]

which is plotted in Fig. [\ref=fig:magnetozerotemp]. As expected, at B  →  0 the above expression reproduces the zero field result, Eq. ([\ref=eq:conductancezerofield]).

It follows from Eq. ([\ref=eq:conductancenonzerofield]) that G(B) is a monotonically increasing function of the magnetic field. Note that the magnetoconductance is a linear function of the magnetic field, δG(B) = G(B) - G(0)  ~  B, at both weak (lB  ≫  lE) and strong (lE  ≫  lB) fields. The positive magnetoconductance (or negative MR) is a signature of the chiral anomaly in Weyl materials [\cite=NielsonNyninomiya] [\cite=SonSpivak] [\cite=SpivakAnton]. At strong fields, lB  ≪  lE, the conductance is determined entirely by the electrons in the chiral (n = 0) Landau levels, which move between the p- and n- regions without backscattering. In this case the positive magnetoconductance is due to the linear in B growth of Landau level degeneracy.

The results ([\ref=eq:conductancezerofield]) and ([\ref=eq:conductancenonzerofield]) assume absence of scattering and inter-valley electric or magnetic breakdown, and hold provided the magnetic and the built-in electric fields are not too strong, ΔK  ≫  l- 1E,l- 1B (here ΔK is the momentum difference between the Weyl nodes). The electric fields Ei must be determined by solving a nonlinear screening problem inside the junction.

Evaluation of the built-in electric field. For simplicity, below we assume that the offsets in the electron-like and hole-like valleys are equal in magnitude, Δi  =    ±  Δ. The corresponding density of states has the form ν(ε) = g(ε2  +  Δ2) / π23v3, and the number density of electrons depends on the electrostatic potential as [formula]. The electrostatic potential U(z) obeys the following Poisson equation,

[formula]

where [formula] is the dopant density, which we model as [formula] with Θ(x) being the step function.

Before presenting an analytic solution of Eq. ([\ref=eq:Poisson]) let us begin with a qualitative discussion of its essential features. Deep inside the doping regions, |z|  ≫  d, the electrostatic potential approaches constant values   ±  εF determined by the dopant density n0. In the middle of the junction |U(z)|  ≪  Δ, and the screening is linear, with the intrinsic screening length [formula]. At [formula] screening becomes nonlinear. Since the creation of the p-n junction requires |U(z)|  >  Δ one should distinguish between the following two cases: i) moderate doping, [formula], and ii) strong doping, εF  ≫  Δ. In either case we assume that the junction width d exceeds the screening length in the doping region, [formula]. The magnitude E* of the electric field at the crossing points in these regimes may be estimated as follows.

i) For moderate doping, [formula], the crossing points are located within the screening length κ- 1 from the boundary of the doping regions, and the electric field at the crossing points may be estimated as E*  ~  εFκ / |e|. Here we assume that Fermi energies in different valleys are of the same order εF. Using Eq. ([\ref=eq:conductancezerofield]) the conductance can be estimated as

[formula]

Note that the conductance turns out to be independent of the junction width d.

ii) For strong doping, εF  ≫  Δ, near the boundary with the doping region, d - |z|  ≪  κ- 1,d, the last term in Eq. ([\ref=eq:Poisson]) may be neglected and the solution (on the doping-free side) acquires a simple form,

[formula]

Since inside the doping region |U(z)|  ~  εF and the screening length is [formula] continuity of the potential and electric field at |z| = d yields [formula], and [formula]. Thus the locations of the crossing points, |U(z*)| = Δ, may be estimated as [formula], and the electric field in them as, [formula]. This results the following estimate for the junction conductance,

[formula]

Note that at strong doping the conductance becomes independent of the doping level εF.

Let us now turn to the quantitative treatment of the nonlinear screening problem. The first integral of the Poisson equation ([\ref=eq:Poisson]) can be cast in the following dimensionless form, where Ũ = U / εF, δ  =  Δ  /  εF, [formula] and [formula] are, respectively, the dimensionless electrostatic potential, energy offset, coordinate, and electric field at the center of the junction. Finally, Ũζ denotes the first derivative of Ũ with respect to ζ and εF is related to the dopant density by n0 = 4α(1 + 3δ2)  kFε2F / (3π2e2).

The solution of Eqs. ([\ref=eq:first_integral_U_a]) inside the doping region ζ  >  ζd is given by

[formula]

The solution of Eq. ([\ref=eq:first_integral_U_b]) in the doping-free region is given by

[formula]

where sn(u,k) is the Jacobi elliptic function [\cite=Erdelyi], and the parameters a± and k are given by

[formula]

The integration constants ζ0 and Ẽc in Eqs. ([\ref=eq:sol_U_a]) and ([\ref=eq:sol_U_b]) are determined from the following equations, which express the continuity of the potential Ũ and its derivative at the boundary of the doping region (ζ  =  ζd), Here the abbreviations sd,cd and dd stand for

[formula]

The dimensionless electric field at the center of the junction, Ẽc can be found by solving the above equations numerically. For the dimensionless electric field Ẽ* at the crossing points, Ũ(ζ*) =   ±  δ, using Eq. ([\ref=eq:first_integral_U_b]) we get

[formula]

At strong doping determination of the potential inside the undoped region can be further simplified. In this case both Ẽc and δ are small, and by Eq. ([\ref=eq:a_pm_def]) so are a±. Then the matching conditions can be satisfied only if the function sn(ia+ζ,k) in Eq. ([\ref=eq:sol_U_b]) has a pole near the boundary with the doping region, ζ  ≈  ζd. Since in real space the location of the pole is offset from ±  d by a distance of order of the screening length in the doping region, then to accuracy [formula] we can determine Ẽc from the condition that sn(ia+ζ,k) in Eq. ([\ref=eq:sol_U_b]) must have a pole at ζ  =  ζd.

The Jacobi elliptic function sn(w,k) has a series of simple poles at [formula] with residues ( - 1)m / k. Here m, n are integers, and [formula], is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind. Near the poles the dimensionless potential Ũ in Eq. ([\ref=eq:sol_U_b]) has the form, Ũ(ζ)  ≈  ( - 1)m + 1 / (ζ + iζmn / a+). Since Ũ must be real for real ζ the pole at ζ  =  ζd corresponds to m = n = 0. This gives the condition that determines the dimensionless electric field Ẽc at the center of the junction,

[formula]

The right hand side of this condition is real for all values of Ẽc. For Ẽc  <  3δ2 this is obvious since in this regime 0 < k < 1 and a+ is real, see Eq. ([\ref=eq:a_pm_def]). For Ẽc  >  3δ2 the location of the pole remains real although the parameters a± and k become complex. To see this we express Ẽc in terms of a parameter θ in the form

[formula]

Here θ is real and positive for Ẽc < 3δ2, and becomes purely imaginary, θ  →  iϑ,0 < ϑ  <  π / 2, for 3δ2  <  Ẽc. The parameters a±, and k in Eq. ([\ref=eq:a_pm_def]) may be expressed in terms of θ as [formula] and k = e-  θ. Using the identity [formula], see formula 13.8 (12) of Ref. [\cite=Erdelyi], we can rewrite Eq. ([\ref=eq:pole_k]) in the form

[formula]

that is explicitly real for all values of the electric field Ẽc. The electric field Ẽ* at the crossing points may be obtained using Eqs. ([\ref=eq:E_crossingpoint]) and ([\ref=eq:E_c_theta]).

In the limiting case of d  ≫  1 / κ (strong intrinsic screening) Ẽc  ≪  3δ2 we have θ  ≫  1 and Eq. ([\ref=eq:pole]) simplifies to [formula] The characteristic length lE* at the crossing points can be found from Eq. ([\ref=eq:E_crossingpoint])

[formula]

In the opposite limit of d  ≪  1 / κ (weak intrinsic screening) we have θ  =  iϑ  →  iπ / 2, and Eq. ([\ref=eq:pole]) yields Ẽc  ≈  2K2( - i) / ζ2d = 3πK2( - i) / αd2. The characteristic length lE* corresponding to the electric field at the crossing points is given by

[formula]

The junction conductance ([\ref=eq:conductancezerofield]) in these limiting cases is expressed in the form,

[formula]

As expected, at strong doping it is independent independent of the doping level εF.

We note that in aforementioned cases the assumption that the potential U(z) changes linearly with z in the interval of order lE near the crossing points is satisfied as long as the dimensionless coupling constant is small, α  ≪  1.

It is important to note that the MR of the junction can be significant even in the interval of magnetic fields where it can be treated semiclassically in the regions of the junction. Therefore one can neglect the magnetic field dependence of the density of states in these regions. Finally we note that the value of Ec is unaffected by the magnetic field in all cases considered above.

We would like to discuss differences between the above negative MR in p-n junctions and recently observed negative MR of bulk Weyl semimetals. In bulk Weyl semimetals at εF  ≫  B electrons can be described semiclassically. In the latter case the magnitude of the negative MR is quadratic in B [\cite=SonSpivak] [\cite=SpivakAnton]. It exists only in a situation where the inter-valley relaxation time is much longer than the intra-valley one and only in certain interval of angles between the external electric and magnetic fields, and only in some (usually small) interval of angles between the external electric and magnetic fields. In contrast, the negative MR of p-n junction is governed by the parameter lE / lB and is independent of the relaxation times. Both at small and large magnetic fields its magnitude is linear in B.

Another way to distinguish the contribution of p-n junction to the total negative MR of the device is to study it as a function of the bias voltage V on the junction: the value of G(V,B) should exhibit characteristic asymmetry with respect to a change V  →   - V for diodes.
