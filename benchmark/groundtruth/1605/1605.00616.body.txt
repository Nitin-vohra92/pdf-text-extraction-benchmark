Introduction

Earth-like planets have been detected in the HZs [\citep=Kasting1993] [\citep=Selsis2007a] [\citep=Kopparapu2013] of early type M-dwarfs [\citep=Quintana2014]. Here we address the potential habitability of planets orbiting even less massive objects: ultracool dwarfs (UCDs), which encompass brown dwarfs (BDs) and late type M-dwarfs. The first gas giant was detected around a BD by [\cite=Han2013].Very recently, [\citet=Gillon2016] discovered 3 Earth-sized planets close to an object of mass [formula] (just above the theoretical limit of [formula] between brown dwarfs and M-dwarfs, [\citealt=ChabrierBaraffe1997]). The planets in this system have insolations between 4.25 and 0.02 times Earth's. The third planet may be in the HZ. The atmospheres of these planets could be probed with facilities such as the HST and JWST, which makes them all the more interesting to study.

BDs (i.e., objects of mass [formula]) do not fuse hydrogen in their cores. They contract and become fainter in time. Their HZs therefore move inward in concert with their decreasing luminosities [\citep=Andreeshchev2004] [\citep=Bolmont2011]. Nonetheless, for BDs more massive than [formula] a planet on a fixed or slowly-evolving orbit can stay in the HZ for Gyr timescales [\citep=Bolmont2011]. In this study we consider UCDs of mass up to [formula]. A UCD of mass [formula] is actually a late-type M-dwarf. As for a BD, its luminosity also decreases with time but its mass is high enough so that it starts the fusion of Hydrogen in its core. From that moment on, the HZ stops shrinking, allowing close-in planets to stay more than 10 Gyr in the HZ. However, any planet that enters the HZ has spent time in a region that is too hot for liquid water. A planet experiencing a runaway greenhouse around a Sun-like star is expected to lose considerable amounts of water (one Earth ocean in less than one Gyr). This is due to H2O photolysis by FUV photons and the thermal escape of Hydrogen due to XUV heating of the upper atmosphere. This is the current scenario to explain the water depletion in the atmosphere of Venus and its high enrichment in deuterium [\citep=Solomon1991]. Could planets in the HZs of UCDs, like Venus, have lost all of their water during this early hot phase?

[\citet=BarnesHeller2013] found that planets entering the BD habitable zone are completely dried out by the hot early phase. They concluded that BDs are unlikely candidates for habitable planets. Here we present a study of water loss using more recent estimates for the X-ray luminosity of very low mass stars and confronting results obtained with energy-limited escape with 1D radiation-hydrodynamic mass-loss simulations. We find that - even in a standard case scenario for water retention - planets with an initial Earth-like water reservoir ([formula] kg) could still have water upon reaching the HZ. Once these planets enter the HZ, the water can condense onto the surface [\citep=Matsui1986] [\citep=Zahnle1988]. Observation of these objects, such as the TRAPPIST-1 planets, would probably lift this uncertainty.

Orbital evolution of planets in the ultracool dwarf habitable zone

The UCD habitable zone is located very close-in, at just a few percent of an AU [\citep=Bolmont2011]. Tidal evolution is therefore important. Due to UCDs' atmospheres low degree of ionization [\citep=Mohanty2002] and the high densities, magnetic breaking is inefficient and cannot counteract spin-up due to contraction. UCDs' corotation radii - where the mean motion matches the UCD spin rate - move inward.

Figure [\ref=aM004_Mp1_eo001] shows the evolution of the HZ boundaries for two UCDs: one of mass [formula] and one of mass [formula]. The time at which a planet reaches the HZ depends on its tidal orbital evolution as well as the cooling rate of the UCD. The tidal evolution of a planet around a UCD is mainly controlled by its initial semi-major axis with respect to the corotation radius (in red and orange full lines in Figure [\ref=aM004_Mp1_eo001]). A planet initially interior to the corotation radius migrates inwards due to the tide raised in the UCD and eventually falls on the UCD. A planet initially outside corotation migrates outward [\citep=Bolmont2011]. There does exist a narrow region in which the moving corotation radius catches up to inward-migrating planets and reverses the direction of migration. The planet's probability of survival is smaller the farther away it is from the corotation radius, which is illustrated by the colored gradient area in Figure [\ref=aM004_Mp1_eo001].

Surviving planets cross the shrinking HZ at different times depending on their orbital distance. Close-in planets tend to stay longer in the HZ because the UCDs' luminosity evolution slows as it cools [\citep=ChabrierBaraffe1997]. [\citet=Bolmont2011] showed that for UCDs of mass higher than [formula], planets can spend up to several Gyr in the HZ. Although their earlier tidal histories vary, planets are on basically fixed orbits as they traverse the UCD habitable zone. We computed the mass loss taking into account the orbital tidal evolution, but we found that it has no effect on the result. For the rest of this study we therefore consider the case of planets on fixed orbits. We consider planets at 0.01 AU. This value of semi-major axis is the average of the closest orbit which survives the evolution. For a fixed initial rotation period of the UCD, planets around low mass UCDs could survive at smaller initial orbital radius, than around high mass UCDs. We choose this value to be able to see the trends when the mass of the UCD is increased.

Modeling water loss

Energy limited escape: an efficient process of water loss

In order to place the strongest possible constraints, we calculate water loss via energy-limited escape [\citep=Lammer2003]. The mechanism requires two types of spectral radiation: FUV (100-200 nm) to photo-dissociate water molecules and XUV (0.1-100 nm) to heat up the exosphere. This heating causes atmospheric escape when the thermal velocity of atoms exceeds the escape velocity. Non-thermal loss induced by stellar winds can in theory contribute significantly to the total atmospheric loss, either by the quiescent wind or by the coronal ejections associated with flares [\citep=Lammer2007] [\citep=Khodachenko2007]. For earlier type UCDs, this might be an issue, however we here consider UCDs of spectral type later than M8 type, for which there is no indication of winds that could enhance the atmospheric loss.

Energy-limited escape considers that the energy of incident radiation with λ  <  100 nm is converted into the gravitational energy of the lost atoms. We use the prescription of [\citet=Selsis2007] linking the XUV flux FXUV(at d = 1 AU) to the mass loss rate [formula]:

[formula]

where Rp is the planet's radius, Mp its mass and a its semi-major axis. ε is the fraction of the incoming energy that is transferred into gravitational energy through the mass loss. This efficiency is not to be confused with the heating efficiency, which is the fraction of the incoming energy that is deposited in the form of heat, as only a fraction of the heat drives the hydrodynamic outflow (some being for instance conducted downward). This fraction has been estimated at about 0.1 by [\citet=Yelle2004] and more recently at 0.1 or less in the limit of extreme loss by [\citet=OwenWu2013]. Here we use ε  =  0.1 to place an upper limit on the mass loss rate.The left term of Equation [\ref=eqmassloss], FXUVπR2p / (a / 1AU)2, corresponds to the fraction of the XUV flux intercepted by the planet.

Thus the mass loss rate is given by:

[formula]

Taking into account that the planet might undergo orbital migration or the evolution of the XUV flux the mass lost by the planet at a time t is of:

[formula]

Venus probably lost its water reservoir by this mechanism. Radar observations of the Magellan satellite and ground-based observations showed that the last traces of water on Venus date back at least 1 billion years [\citep=Solomon1991]. Although the Sun was fainter, this corresponds to the critical flux for energy-limited escape to occur [\citep=Kasting1988]. As UCDs are less bright than the Sun, we expect their XUV flux to be lower than the Sun's.

One could argue that the XUV cross section radius of the planet is bigger than the planet's radius and is probably similar the Hill radius [\citep=Erkaev2007]. This assumption would mean that the water mass loss would be higher than what we propose to calculate here. In a hydrodynamic outflow the effect of the Roche Lobe is to weaken the effect of gravity compared to the pressure force, its role is felt through the gradient of the potential. For transonic outflow the distance of the sonic point from the surface of the planet depends on the gradient of the potential, with shallow gradients (i.e. closer to the Hill radius) pushing the sonic point closer to the planet increases the mass loss. We tested our hypothesis of taking the real radius of the planet with a hydrodynamical code [\citep=OwenAlvarez2016]. We find that, for the small rocky planets we consider here, this does not overestimate the mass loss as much as the work of [\citet=Erkaev2007] would imply (taking the Roche radius), as the effect is of the order of a few percent.

The joined escape of Hydrogen and Oxygen

The computed mass loss [formula] is linked to a mass flux FM given by: [formula]. We consider here a mass loss, independently of the proportion of Hydrogen and Oxygen atoms lost. Losing just Hydrogen atoms and losing Hydrogen and Oxygen atoms does not have the same consequence for water loss. For example, if only Hydrogen atoms are lost, losing an ocean means that the planet loses the mass of Hydrogen contained in one Earth Ocean (9 times lower that the mass of water in one Earth Ocean). This would change the proportion of H/O thus preventing an eventual recombination of water [\citep=Gillmann2009]. In contrast, if the planet loses Hydrogen and Oxygen in stoichiometric proportion, losing an ocean means that the planet is losing the mass of water contained in one Earth Ocean. This is the more favorable case for water retention because it necessitates a higher energy to lose one ocean.

In the following, we show that it possible to estimate the proportion of escaping Hydrogen and Oxygen atoms. The mass loss flux FM (kg.s- 1.m- 2) can be expressed in terms of the particle fluxes (atoms.s- 1.m- 2):

[formula]

The ratio of the escape fluxes of Hydrogen and Oxygen in such an hydrodynamic outflow can be calculated following [\citet=Hunten1987]:

[formula]

where [formula] the mass of one Hydrogen atom, [formula] the mass of one Oxygen atom and [formula] is called the crossover mass and is defined by:

[formula]

where T is the temperature in the exosphere, g is the gravity and b is a collision parameter between Oxygen and Hydrogen. In the Oxygen and Hydrogen mixture, we consider [formula], [formula], which corresponds to the proportion of dissociated water. This leads to [formula].

When [formula], only Hydrogen atoms are escaping and [formula]. When [formula], Hydrogen atoms drag along some Oxygen atoms and:

[formula]

With Equations [\ref=equ:mc], [\ref=escape2] and [\ref=escape3], we can compute the mass flux of Hydrogen atoms:

[formula]

In order to calculate the flux of Hydrogen atoms, we need an estimation of the XUV luminosity of the star considered, as well as an estimation of the temperature T.

Physical inputs

We first assume that protoplanetary disks around UCDs dissipate after 1 Myr [\citep=Pascucci2009]; this is our "time zero". We consider that when the planet is embedded in the disk it is protected and does not experience water loss.

We assume that at time zero planets have non-negligible water content. Planets are thought to acquire water during and after accretion via impacts of volatile-rich objects condensed at larger orbital radii. If planets form in-situ in the HZs of UCDs then it may be difficult to retain water because of the rapid formation timescale and very high impact speeds [\citep=Lissauer2007] [\citep=Raymond2007]. However, if these planets or some of their constituent planetary embryos migrated inward from wider orbital distances then they are likely to have significant water contents [\citep=Raymond2008] [\citep=Ogihara2009]. Although the origin of hot super-Earths is debated [\citep=Raymond2008] [\citep=Raymond2014], several known close-in planets are consistent with having large volatile reservoirs [\citep=Rogers2010] [\citep=Berta2012]. We therefore consider it plausible for Earth-like planets to form in the UCD habitable zone with a water content comparable to Earth's surface reservoir. Water can also be trapped in the mantle of the planet during the formation process and perhaps released in the atmosphere at later times through volcanic activity.

A key input into our model is the stellar flux at high energies. There are no observations of the EUV flux of UCDs. We assume here that the loss rate of water is not limited by the photo-dissociation of water. This assumes that FUV radiation is sufficient to dissociate all water molecules and produce Hydrogen at a rate higher than its escape rate into space. X-ray observations with Chandra/ACIS-I2 exist for objects from M8 to L5 [\citep=Berger2010] [\citep=Williams2014] for the range 0.1-10 keV (0.1-12.4 nm). This only represents a small portion of the XUV range considered in Equations [\ref=eqmassloss1] and [\ref=eqmassloss2]. For solar-type stars the flux in the whole XUV range is 2 to 5 times higher than in the X-ray range [\citep=Ribas2005]. We thus multiply the value corresponding to the X-ray range by 5 and consider it can be used as a proxy for the whole XUV range. Observations of objects of spectral types M0 to M7 show that the X-ray luminosity scales as 10- 3 the bolometric luminosity Lbol [\citep=Pizzolato2003]. More recent observations from [\citet=Berger2010] and [\citet=Williams2014] show that the K luminosity of L dwarfs seems to scale as 10- 5  ×   Lbol. Some of these observations are actually non-detections, so the X-ray luminosity of objects like 2M0523-14 (L2-L3), 2M0036+18 (L3-L4) and 2M1507-16 (L5) must be even lower than 10- 5  ×   Lbol. There is no indication of whether the X-ray luminosity varies in time.

We consider two limiting cases for our water loss calculation. In the first we adopt a value of 10- 5  ×   Lbol as an upper limit for the XUV luminosity of UCDs. As the bolometric luminosity changes with time, we consider that the X-ray luminosity does as well. In the second case we assume that the X-ray luminosity does not vary with the bolometric luminosity but rather remains constant. We adopt the value of 1025.4 erg.s[formula] W from [\citet=Williams2014]. This value corresponds to a X-ray detection (0.1-10 keV) of the object 2MASS13054019-2541059 AB of spectral type L2. For each case we then use Equation [\ref=eqmassloss2] to calculate the water loss of a planet of [formula], [formula] and [formula].

We compared the XUV flux received by the planets of Figure [\ref=aM004_Mp1_eo001] to the one Earth receives. Before reaching the HZ, they are at least a few times higher than Earth's incoming XUV flux.

Water loss of planets in the UCD habitable zone

In Section [\ref=stoichio], we give estimates of the ratio of Hydrogen atoms and Oxygen atoms loss. In Section [\ref=ener_lim_esc], we give the results obtained by the method exposed in Section [\ref=method], then in Section [\ref=hydrocode] we compare them with 1D radiation-hydrodynamic mass-loss simulations [\citep=OwenAlvarez2016].

Results on the stoichiometry of H and O loss

We assume ε  =  0.1 as introduced in Section [\ref=method], we also assume that the XUV luminosity is here [formula] erg/s and the planet is at a = 0.01 ~ AU. This is our baseline case. Using these values and Equation [\ref=eqmassloss1], we calculate the mass loss flux FM  =  F0:

[formula]

Using 1D radiation-hydrodynamic mass-loss simulations [\citep=OwenAlvarez2016], we find that the temperature T of the wind is of the order of 3000 K, which is much lower than what is calculated for hot Jupiters [\citep=Lammer2003] [\citep=Erkaev2007] [\citep=MurrayClay2009].

Using Equation [\ref=escape4] and the estimation of T, we can compute the flux of Hydrogen atoms FH as a function of the XUV luminosity LXUV compared to our baseline case luminosity L0. Figure [\ref=FH_vs_FtotonF0] shows the behavior of the mass loss of the atmosphere in unit of Earth Ocean equivalent content of Hydrogen (EOH) with respect to the ratio LXUV / L0. This behavior is plotted for two cases: a stoichiometric mixture of Hydrogen and Oxygen atoms ([formula]) and a mixture slightly depleted in Hydrogen ([formula]). We can see that the mass loss is a monotonous function of the total XUV luminosity, and for both cases it saturates much below our baseline case. For a stoichiometric mixture, at a ratio LXUV / L0  ~  0.08, the Oxygen atoms start to be dragged along therefore consuming energy. For a mixture depleted in Hydrogen, Oxygen atoms start to be dragged along for lower incoming XUV luminosity LXUV / L0  ~  0.04.

Here however, for LXUV = L0, we find that one Oxygen atom is lost for about 3.7 Hydrogen atoms: [formula]. To conclude, for a X-ray luminosity of 1025.4 erg/s, there is no stoichiometric loss of Hydrogen and Oxygen. However, the situation is not as catastrophic as it would be if only Hydrogen escaped. In the following, we give the Hydrogen lost by the planet. We assume that [formula] is constant and the Hydrogen mass loss is given by:

[formula]

where m is obtained with Equation [\ref=eqmassloss2] and is given in unit of the mass of Hydrogen in one Earth Ocean (EOH, which corresponds to [formula] kg). Hydrogen is the limiting element for the recombination of water, so that the remaining content of Hydrogen in EOH actually represents the ocean portion we can expect to precipitate once in the HZ.

Results with energy limited escape

Figure [\ref=maps_massloss_Mp1_Ms_alum5] shows the evolution of the Hydrogen loss from an Earth-mass planet orbiting a [formula] BD as a function of both time and orbital radius (assumed to remain constant). We assumed here stoichiometric loss of Hydrogen and Oxygen atoms, i.e., rF  =  0.5. Let us consider that the planet has an initial water content comparable to Earth's surface water ([formula] kg, corresponding to a Hydrogen quantity of [formula] kg) and is located at 0.01 AU from a 1 ~ Myr-old BD. Figure [\ref=maps_massloss_Mp1_Ms_alum5] shows that it would lose 0.55 ~ EOH in ~  60 Myr (vertical red dashed line). Thus, there would be sufficient water for 45% of an Earth Ocean to precipitate when the planet reaches in the HZ. As the bolometric luminosity decreases with time, the mass loss is more efficient for young ages. This planet could therefore be considered a potentially habitable planet, assuming an appropriate atmospheric composition and structure.

Figure [\ref=massloss_Mp_alum5cst_Mbd_legend] shows the water loss for planets of [formula], [formula] and [formula] orbiting UCDs of different masses at 0.01 AU. The figure shows how much water was lost by the time each planet reached the HZ. This time is ~  3 Myr for a BD of [formula] and ~  300 Myr for a dwarf of [formula]. The calculations were done for both cases: LX / Lbol = 10- 5 (red symbols) and LX  =  1025.4 erg/s (blue symbols) and for two assumptions about the escape of Hydrogen and Oxygen atoms: a) [formula] (stoichiometric loss) and b) [formula], which is what is calculated for the baseline case (see Section [\ref=method]).

Assuming LX  =  1025.4 erg/s, we find that planets orbiting more massive UCDs lose more water. This is mainly because of the much longer time spent by those planets interior to the HZ. For LX / Lbol = 10- 5, planets lose even more water than for LX  =  1025.4 erg/s because their hosts were more luminous at earlier age.

We also find that lower-mass planets lose their water at a higher rate than higher-mass ones: for an Earth-like composition [\citep=Fortney2007], the quantity [formula]density) decreases when Mp increases, so Equation [\ref=eqmassloss1] tells us that less water is lost for more massive planets. In other words, the increase of gravitational energy is not compensated by the higher cross section.

Figure [\ref=massloss_Mp_alum5cst_Mbd_legend]a) provides a best case scenario for water retention (rF  =  0.5). This calculation assumes LX / Lbol = 10- 5 and an initial water surface water budget of one Earth Ocean for all planets. We find that [formula] planets orbiting BDs of mass lower than [formula] reach the HZ with a non-negligible water content. For planets more massive than [formula], this limit can be pushed to [formula]. However, assuming LX  =  1025.4 erg/s allows to push this limit for the range of planetary mass considered here to [formula].

Figure [\ref=massloss_Mp_alum5cst_Mbd_legend]b) represents a more likely scenario than a). In this scenario, the escape is not quite strong enough to drag along every Oxygen atoms: around an atom of Oxygen is lost with every 3.7 atoms of Hydrogen (rF  =  0.27). It shows us that assuming LX / Lbol = 10- 5 and an initial Earth's ocean content, [formula] planets orbiting BDs of mass lower than [formula] reach the HZ with a non-negligible water content. For planets more massive than [formula], this limit can be pushed to [formula]. However, assuming LX  =  1025.4 erg/s allows to push this limit for the range of planetary mass considered here to [formula].

The ratio of loss of Oxygen atoms with respect to Hydrogen atoms was calculated for LX  =  1025.4 erg/s and the results displayed in Figure [\ref=massloss_Mp_alum5cst_Mbd_legend]b) do not take into account that as time passes the atmosphere is getting depleted in Hydrogen atoms. This has several consequences. First, as Figure [\ref=FH_vs_FtotonF0] shows, the escape rate is lower when the atmosphere is depleted in Hydrogen. So, our results in Figure [\ref=massloss_Mp_alum5cst_Mbd_legend]b) for LX  =  1025.4 erg/s (blue circles, squares and triangles) actually overestimate the mass loss. The results should be somewhere between what was calculated for rF  =  0.5 and for rF  =  0.27. Second, for LX / Lbol = 10- 5, LXUV is initially larger than L0, so the ratio of loss of Hydrogen and Oxygen atoms is initially closer to stoichiometry (see Figure [\ref=FH_vs_FtotonF0]) than what was calculated for LX  =  1025.4 erg/s. Furthermore, as was discussed in the first point, the escape rate also decreases due to the depletion in Hydrogen atoms. Consequently, for LX / Lbol = 10- 5, the results obtained with an energy limited escape calculation are again overestimated. And the mass loss should be somewhere in between what was calculated for [formula] and for [formula].

At larger orbital radius less water is lost, for two reasons. First, as the planet is farther from the UCD, the mass loss rate is lower (see Equation [\ref=eqmassloss1]). Second, a more distant planet reaches the HZ earlier in the UCD's evolution (see Figure [\ref=maps_massloss_Mp1_Ms_alum5]). For planets around BDs, this means that the planet will stay less time in the HZ. However, for a M-dwarf of [formula], the HZ does not continue to shrink indefinitely (see Figure [\ref=aM004_Mp1_eo001]). In this case, the mass of the dwarf is high enough that late in its evolution, its core reaches a high enough temperature to initiate Hydrogen fusion. [\citet=Bolmont2011] therefore showed that such a planet would remain in the HZ up to 10 Gyr. For example, a planet at a semi-major axis of 0.019 AU around a [formula] dwarf, would enter the HZ at an age of 55 Myr, with 0.43 ~ EOH if LX / Lbol = 10- 5 and 0.95 ~ EOH if LX  =  1025.4 erg/s. These objects are therefore interesting targets for astrobiology.

As the maximum of the water loss occurs around an UCD of [formula], we can also estimate the minimum semi-major for which planets can still have a fraction of their initial Earth Ocean. For LX / Lbol = 10- 5, we find that planets farther away than 0.017 AU can retain a fraction of their initial water reservoir whatever their mass ([formula]) and whatever the assumption made on the ratio of the molecules escape ([formula]). For LX  =  1025.4 erg/s, we find that planets farther away than 0.0103 AU can retain a fraction of their initial water reservoir whatever their mass ([formula]) and whatever the assumption made on the ratio of the molecules escape ([formula]).

Results with a hydrodynamical code

In order to guide our calculations, we perform a set of 1D radiation-hydrodynamic mass-loss simulations based on the calculations of [\citet=OwenAlvarez2016]. The simulations are similar in setup to those described by [\citet=OwenAlvarez2016], where we perform 1D spherically symmetric simulations using a modified version of the zeus code [\citep=Stone1992] [\citep=Hayes2006], along a streamline connecting the star and planet. We include tidal gravity, but neglect the effects of the Coriolis force as it is a small while the outflow remains sub-sonic [\citep=MurrayClay2009] [\citep=OwenJackson2012]. In order to get a sense of the reliability of our simple calculations, we consider only the case of the [formula], [formula] planet at an orbital separation of 0.01 ~ AU. The radial grid is non-uniform and consists of 192 cells, the flow is evolved for 40 sound crossing times such that a steady state is achieved (which is checked by making sure the pseudo-Bernoulli potential and mass-flux are constant). We explicitly note that these simulations do not include line cooling from Oxygen that maybe important in these flows, and as such these calculations should be considered as a guide with which to compare the standard energy-limited calculations. Line cooling from Oxygen would necessarily reduce the temperature and mass-loss rate. We can use the simulations to calculate the efficiency (ε) parameter along with the corresponding mass loss. Figure [\ref=efficacity_vs_flux] shows the variation of ε with the incoming XUV flux, we note that the tidal gravity places a negligible role in changing the mass-loss rates with stellar mass. At high fluxes the efficiency drops off due to the increased radiative cooling that can occur as the flows get more vigorous and dense. The drop off at low fluxes is simply caused by the fact that the heating rate is not strong enough to launch a powerful wind. At high fluxes the temperature peaks at a radii [formula], indicating some of the XUV photons are absorbed far from the planet, increasing its effective absorbing area, but at low fluxes the temperature peaks close to [formula]. Figure [\ref=efficacity_vs_flux] shows that for a X-ray luminosity of LX  =  1025.4 erg/s (corresponding to a flux in XUV of [formula] erg/s/cm2), we slightly overestimated ε by a factor of [formula].

Figure [\ref=massloss_Mp_alum5cst_Mbd_legend] shows that the results obtained with a simple energy-limited escape calculation are of the same order of magnitude as with those obtained with an explicit hydrodynamic model (crosses in Figure [\ref=massloss_Mp_alum5cst_Mbd_legend]). However, Figure [\ref=massloss_Mp_alum5cst_Mbd_legend] also shows that our model overestimates mass loss by a factor of ~  1.17 (for LX  =  1025.4 erg/s, in agreement with Figure [\ref=efficacity_vs_flux]) to ~  2 (for LX  /  Lbol = 10- 5).

When we assume a stoichiometric loss of Hydrogen and Oxygen atoms (rF  =  0.5), we find that only the [formula] planet orbiting the UCD of [formula] loses more than one EOH (for LX / Lbol = 10- 5, see Figure [\ref=massloss_Mp_alum5cst_Mbd_legend]a), red cross). For a BD of mass [formula], the planet only loses about 0.30 ~ EOH, which means that about 70% of an Earth Ocean could precipitate when reaching the HZ.

When we assume that [formula], we find that planets around BDs of mass inferior to [formula] can retain a fraction of their initial water reservoir. For a BD of mass [formula], the planet now loses about 0.50 ~ EOH, which means that about 50% of an Earth Ocean could precipitate when reaching the HZ. We remind here that due to the depletion of Hydrogen in the atmosphere, the more probable water loss would between what we obtain for [formula] and for [formula]. We thus expect this planet to have between 50% and 70% of its initial water reservoir when reaching the HZ.

Consequently, the conclusions remain the same as in Section [\ref=ener_lim_esc]: close-in planets orbiting at 0.01 AU around a BD of mass [formula] are the good candidates for the search of habitable candidates: they lose less than an Earth Ocean before reaching the HZ, they can stay in the HZ a non-negligible time and they are easily detectable and characterizable. If the planets are located farther away, the best candidates would orbit UCDs of [formula].

Implication for the TRAPPIST-1 planets

The three planets of the TRAPPIST-1 system [\citep=Gillon2016] are Earth-size planets, and thus probably rocky [\citep=WeissMarcy2014] [\citep=Rogers2015]. They orbit a M8-type dwarf of [formula]. TRAPPIST-1b is located at ab  =  0.01111 AU, TRAPPIST-1c at ac  =  0.01522 AU. The orbit of TRAPPIST-1d is poorly constrained, however it is farther away than ad  =  0.022 AU. The irradiation of the planets are respectively: 4.25 [formula], 2.26 [formula] and 0.02-[formula], where [formula] is the insolation received by the Earth. Therefore TRAPPIST-1d could be in the HZ. The age of the system has been estimated to be more than 500 Myr. The structural evolution grids we use for a dwarf of [formula] [\citep=ChabrierBaraffe1997] show that the luminosity and radius of TRAPPIST-1 correspond to a body of ~  400 ~ Myr, which is lower than the estimated age of the system, but nonetheless of the same order of magnitude. This is consistent with the fact that evolution models seem to under-estimate the luminosity of low-mass objects [\citep=Chabrier2007].

Figure [\ref=massloss_TRAPPIST_alum5_254ergs_eps01_X5_tinit_1d6_times155and1] shows the mass loss of the TRAPPIST planets as a function of time, as calculated in the energy limited escape scenario. The colored regions delimit the water loss calculated with [formula] and [formula] and thus delimit the regions where the value of the expected Hydrogen loss should be. We assumed that the semi-major axes of the planets remain constant throughout the evolution.

Tables [\ref=waterlost1] and [\ref=waterlost2] summarize the results for different ages of the dwarf: the age [formula] Myr at which TRAPPIST-1d enters the HZ, the age of the dwarf as estimated with the evolution grids, the estimated lower limit of the age of the dwarf of [\citet=Gillon2016] and an age of 1000 Myr. Assuming LX / Lbol = 10- 5, we find that the two inner planets of the system are completely desiccated at the possible ages of the dwarf (400 and 500 Myr). Assuming that TRAPPIST-1d stops losing its water when it reaches the HZ, it should still have between 63 and 78% of its initial Earth Ocean. However, even if we assume that the planet continues losing its water in the HZ, it would still have more than 20% of its initial Earth Ocean at the estimated ages of the dwarf. Assuming LX  =  1025.4 erg/s, the situation is much more favorable. The two inner planets could have retained a small fraction of their potential initial Earth Ocean at the possible ages of the dwarf. The observation with transit spectroscopy of the atmospheres of the two inner planets with facilities such as the JWST would therefore allow us to constrain the XUV luminosity of the dwarf. Assuming LX  =  1025.4 erg/s, we find that TRAPPIST-1d is very likely to have a non-negligible water content. Indeed, if we consider that it stops losing its water when it reaches the HZ, it should still have more than 98% of an initial Earth Ocean. If we assume that it continues losing its water in the HZ, it would still have more than 70% of its initial Earth Ocean at the estimated ages of the dwarf. Even if the star is 1 Gyr old, it would still have a minimum of 30% of its initial Earth Ocean. Note here, that the mass loss calculated with the hydrodynamical code would give us results between 1.17 and 2 times lower than what is given here. The estimations of Tables [\ref=waterlost1] and [\ref=waterlost2] are therefore an underestimation of the expected water reservoir.

The orbit of TRAPPIST-1d is not well constrained, but there is a high probability that it is in the HZ. This calculation shows that there is a non-negligible probability that this planet was able to retain a high fraction of an eventual water reservoir of one Earth Ocean, which makes it a very interesting astrobiology target. Assuming [formula], we can calculate the maximum amount of Dioxygen O2 left on the planet. For LX  =  1025.4 erg/s, the pressure of O2 is respectively PO2 = 3,27,34 and 69 bar at [formula], 400 ~ Myr, 500 ~ Myr and 1000 ~ Myr. For LX / Lbol = 10- 5, the pressure of O2 left on the planet is respectively PO2 = 36,79,84 and 97 bar at [formula], 400 ~ Myr, 500 ~ Myr and 871 ~ Myr, i.e. when all Hydrogen escaped. [\citet=Belu2013] showed that the atmosphere of the planets of TRAPPIST-1 could be characterizable with facilities like JWST. The observation of these planets could therefore bring us informations on water delivery during the formation processes and their capacity to retain water.

Why this result likely overestimates water loss

In this section, we show that the thought process we performed in the previous section, both following the standard way of computing mass loss [\citep=BarnesHeller2013] and using simple radiation-hydrodynamics calculations [\citep=OwenAlvarez2016] may actually be overestimating the mass loss.

The time of the disk dispersal we consider here might be too short for such low mass objects. The evolution of disks around UCDs is not well constrained, however it is reasonable to assume they dissipate between 1 Myr and 10 Myr [\citep=Pascucci2009] [\citep=Liu2015] [\citep=Downes2015]. Disks around UCDs could very well dissipate at an age of 10 Myr. As young UCDs are brighter than old UCDs, a later dissipation of the disk would mean that a planet is exposed less time and to a weaker XUV radiation, meaning that the planet would lose less water than what was calculated in this work.

For example, using the energy limited escape calculation and assuming a stoichiometric loss of Hydrogen and Oxygen atoms, a planet orbiting a [formula] BD at 0.01 AU would only lose 25% of its initial Earth Ocean by the time it reaches the HZ if the disk dissipates at 10 Myr (instead of 55% if the disk dissipates at 1 Myr, see Figure [\ref=massloss_Mp_alum5cst_Mbd_legend], for LX / Lbol  <  10- 5). And a planet orbiting a [formula] BD at 0.01 AU would lose only 77% of its initial Earth Ocean if the disk dissipates at 10 Myr (instead of being totally desiccated if the disk dissipates at 1 Myr). Under this assumption of a longer lived protoplanetary disk, this planet could therefore have surface liquid water when in the HZ.

UCDs might be too cold to emit the FUV radiations needed to photo-dissociate water molecules. This would mean that the water loss would be less efficient. Recent observations of 11 M-dwarfs by [\citet=France2016] showed that the estimated energy flux in the Lyman-alpha band is equal to the flux in the XUV range. Using this constraint, we can estimate the quantity of Hydrogen produced by photodissociation. Figure [\ref=Hloss_Hphoto_sma001_Mp_alum5_254ergs_Mbd_eps01_X5_tinit_1d6_EOH_rf_027] shows the quantity of Hydrogen lost according to our calculations of Section [\ref=ener_lim_esc] and the quantity of Hydrogen available.

If all the incoming FUV photons do photolyse H2O molecules with a 100% efficiency (εα  =  1) and all the resulting Hydrogen atoms remain available for the escape process then photolysis does not appear to be limiting the loss process. The production rate of Hydrogen atoms exceeds by a factor of ~  4 the computed thermal loss assuming an Hydrogen and Oxygen mixture and rF  =  0.27. In reality, however, only a fraction of the incoming FUV actually results in the loss of an Hydrogen atom. Part of the incoming photons are absorbed by other compounds (in particular Hydrogen in the Lyman alpha line) or backscattered to space. Then, products of H2O photolysis (mainly OH and H) recombine through various chemical pathways. If the efficiency εα is less than about 20% then the loss rate becomes photolysis-limited. Although efficiency calculations would require detailed FUV radiative transfer and photochemical schemes, we can safely argue that efficiencies much lower than 20% can be expected.

It is important to stress that the loss is likely to be photolysis-limited, which would allow us to calculate upper limits of the loss without the need of complex thermal and non-thermal escape models. At this point the FUV flux, which is the key input for H2O photolysis, is only estimated based on the XUV/FUV ratio measured on earlier-type stars. Measuring the FUV of UCDs could allow us to put strong constraints on the water erosion on their planets.

The XUV flux considered here might be much higher than what is really emitted by UCDs. Indeed, all Chandra observations of X-ray emissions of low mass objects [\citep=Berger2010] [\citep=Williams2014] are actually non-detection for the UCD range. New estimations from [\citet=Osten2015] show that found upper limits for the X-ray luminosity for the object Luhman 16AB (WISE J104915.57-531906.1, L7.5 and T0.5 spectral types) are lower than what we used in this study: LX  <  1023 erg/s or LX / Lbol  <  10- 5.7. Besides, [\citet=Mohanty2002] show that in BDs' cool atmospheres the degree of ionization is very low so it is very possible that the mechanisms needed to emit X-rays are not efficient enough to produce the fluxes considered in this work. In which case, the computed mass loss would be lower than what we calculated here.

We consider that the planets have an initial content of one Earth's ocean, but it might be more. Both on the observational and theoretical side, it has been shown that planets could even have a large portion of their bulk made out of water [\citep=Kuchner2003] [\citep=Leger2004]. For example, [\citet=Kaltenegger2013] have identified Kepler-62e and 62f to be possible ocean planets. Furthermore, as discussed in [\citet=Marty2012], a large part of water can be trapped in the mantle to be released by geological events during the evolution of the planet, allowing a replenishment of the surface water content.

[\citet=Johnson2013] showed using molecular-kinetic simulations that the mass loss saturates for high incoming energy, which could mean that in our case the mass loss would be smaller than what we calculated. However, their results should be applied to our specific problem in order to be sure.

Conclusions

Unlike [\citet=BarnesHeller2013], we find that planets in the HZs of UCDs should in most cases be able to retain their water. The main differences between [\citet=BarnesHeller2013] and our work are the following. First, they used for the XUV radiation an observed upper limit for early-type M-dwarfs [\citep=Pizzolato2003] for which the XUV luminosity scales as 10- 3 times the bolometric luminosity. We used here more recent estimates of X-ray emission of later-type dwarfs, which show that UCDs emit much less X-rays than earlier-type M-dwarfs [\citep=Berger2010] [\citep=Williams2014] [\citep=Osten2015]. Second, in addition to the standard method used in [\citet=BarnesHeller2013], we also tested the robustness of our results obtained with an energy-limited escape model with those obtained with 1D radiation-hydrodynamic mass-loss simulations [\citep=OwenAlvarez2016]. We found a good agreement between the two methods. This allowed us to have a better estimate of the fraction of the incoming energy that is transferred into gravitational energy through the mass loss (ε). Thanks to this estimation of ε, we found that a standard energy-limited escape model gives actually an overestimate of the water loss (by a factor 1.17 to 2). Third, [\citet=BarnesHeller2013] used a larger XUV cross-section for the planets. However, using our hydrodynamical model, we found that for such small planets the XUV cross-section is very similar to the radius of the planet and only causes a difference of a few percents in the quantity of water lost. Fourth, they considered a loss of only Hydrogen atoms, while in this work we estimated the ratio of the escape fluxes of both Hydrogen and Oxygen atoms. We found that in the configuration considered here, Oxygen atoms are dragged away by the escaping Hydrogen atoms, which is more favorable for water retention.

Considering a very unfavorable scenario for water retention - complete dissociation of water molecules and energy limited escape - and assuming that the X-ray luminosity of the UCD scales as 10- 5 its bolometric luminosity, we find that planets orbiting at 0.01 AU around BDs of mass lower than [formula] can retain an initial Hydrogen reservoir (here equal to the Hydrogen reservoir in one Earth Ocean) when interior to the HZ. When reaching the HZ, the remaining Hydrogen can recombine with Oxygen to form water molecules that can then condense. Using a hydrodynamical model, this limit is pushed to [formula]. Assuming a constant X-ray luminosity of 1025.4 erg/s, we find that for both models, planets around all BDs could retain a non-negligible fraction of their initial water reservoir. Even a planet at 0.01 AU around M-dwarf of [formula] could retain a small fraction of its initial water reservoir.

[\citet=Bolmont2011] showed that the more massive the BD, the longer a close-in planet spends in the HZ. This work therefore shows that, at worst, there is still a sweet spot for potential life around BDs: planets orbiting BDs of masses between [formula] and [formula] could have surface liquid water AND have it for a long time ([formula], according to [\citealt=Bolmont2011]). Of course, if one of the mechanisms considered here does not take place, or if the real XUV flux of BDs is lower than the upper value we considered, as we discussed in the previous Section [\ref=whynot], the sweet spot for life could widen towards the massive BDs. The low-mass BDs will always suffer from the fact that they cool down very fast and that at best, planets spend a few 100 Myr in the HZ. Even though this could be enough time for life to appear, its potential detectability would be a rare event. The high mass BDs are interesting targets but in this scenario, planets at 0.01 AU could have a rather small water reservoir when entering the HZ. However planets farther away (>  0.017 ~ AU for Earth-size planets around a [formula]) could have a non-negligible water reservoir when entering the HZ.

We considered here close-in planets. Due to the planets proximity to the star, they are likely to be tidally locked when reaching the HZ. As was shown in [\citet=Yang2013], due to the presence of clouds at the substellar point of tidally-locked planets, planets could host surface liquid water at distances closer than the usual HZ inner edge. Consequently, according to [\citet=Bolmont2011], planets closer than 0.01 AU might be even better targets (they would stay in the HZ for a longer time). However, these planets being slightly closer, they are expected to lose more water than what was calculated for 0.01 AU. For example, an energy-limited escape calculation for a planet with an initial semi-major axis of 0.007 AU around a [formula] BD would give a water loss of about 70% of Earth's ocean (see Figure [\ref=maps_massloss_Mp1_Ms_alum5], assuming rF  =  0.5). The more reliable 1D radiation-hydrodynamic simulations would therefore calculate a loss of about 0.35 ~ EOH, which means that the planet could retain a non-negligible fraction of its initial water content and have liquid water when in the HZ. Furthermore, as the inner edge of the HZ is closer to the BD for these tidally-locked planets [\citep=Yang2013], it also means that they reach the HZ earlier, so that they would probably lose even less water.

We only consider here quiescent energetic emissions. However BDs could emit energetic flares for a significant fraction of their lifetime in the Hα emission line and in the U-band [\citep=Schmidt2014a] [\citep=Schmidt2014b]. This would also endanger the survival of a water reservoir. [\citet=Gizis2013] showed that these flares can be as frequent as 1-2 times a month (e.g., the L1 dwarf W1906+40). W1906+40 experienced a white flare during [formula] hours, which released an energy of 1031 erg (in a band 400-900 nm). Let us consider here that the flare released in the XUV range 20% of the energy it released in the 400-900 nm band [\citep=Kretzschmar2011]. This flare would then correspond to an energy ~  20 times what we considered for the quiescent emission in the case of the constant XUV emission. Using the energy limited escape formula, we find that if such a flare happened during 2 hours every months (as could be the case for W1906+40), a [formula] planet at 0.01 AU would lose an Earth's ocean in ~  1 Gyr (assuming stoichiometric loss of Hydrogen and Oxygen atoms). Taking flares into account would then reduce slightly the lifetime of the water reservoir: instead of entering the HZ with 0.85 ~ EOH, the [formula] planet at 0.01 AU ([formula], LX  =  1025.4 erg/s, blue squares on Figure [\ref=massloss_Mp_alum5cst_Mbd_legend]a), would enter with 0.79 ~ EOH. Taking into account the flares therefore do not change significantly the results.

Of course, water retention is not synonymous with habitability. Given that BD's HZs are very close-in, HZ planets feel strong tidal forces. This may affect their ability to host surface liquid water. For example, a lone planet would likely be in synchronous rotation. One can imagine that all liquid water might condense onto the night side (cold trap). However, this can be avoided if the atmosphere is dense enough to efficient redistribute heat [\citep=Leconte2013]. In multiple-planet systems, a HZ planet's eccentricity can be excited and lead to significant tidal heating [\citep=Barnes2009] [\citep=Barnes2010] [\citep=Bolmont2013] [\citep=Bolmont2014sf2a]. In some cases tidal heating could trigger a runaway greenhouse state [\citep=BarnesHeller2013]. In other situations, such as in the outer parts of the HZ or even exterior to the HZ, tidal heating may be beneficial by providing an additional source of heating and perhaps even by helping to drive plate tectonics [\citep=Barnes2009].

Despite the lack of knowledge about escape mechanisms, in particular about the way Hydrogen and Oxygen conjointly escape (or not), we find that there are possibilities that planets around UCDs might arrive in the HZ with an important water reservoir. As shown in Section [\ref=whynot], there might be even more possibilities if the loss of Hydrogen is photolysis-limited, which would happen if the efficiency of this process is below 20%. We also find that the two inner planets of the system TRAPPIST-1 [\citep=Gillon2016] might be desiccated (the presence of water would actually bring us informations about the dwarf's XUV luminosity) but that the third planet might still have an important water reservoir. Furthermore, planets in the HZs of BDs may be easy to detect in transit due to their large transit depths and short orbital periods [\citep=Belu2013] [\citep=Triaud2013]. Given their large abundance in the Solar neighborhood (~  1300 have been detected as of today according to ), such planets may be among the best nearby targets for atmospheric characterization with the JWST.
