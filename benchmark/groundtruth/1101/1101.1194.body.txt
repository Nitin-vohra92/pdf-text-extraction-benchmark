An analogue of the Baire Category Theorem

Introduction

Let [formula] be an expansion of an ordered field (K, < , + ,  ·  ). We say [formula] is definably complete if every bounded subset of K definable in [formula] has a supremum in K. Such structures were first studied by Miller in [\cite=ivp]. The main result of this paper is the following definable analogue of the Baire Category Theorem.

Theorem A is a positive answer to a conjecture of Fornasiero and Servi raised in [\cite=fornasiero] [\cite=fs]. By their work, Theorem A implies that definable versions of many standard facts from real analysis hold in [formula]. Among these are a definable analogue of the Kuratowski-Ulam Theorem, a restricted version of Sard's Theorem and several results in the model theoretic study of Pfaffian functions (see [\cite=fs] [\cite=fs2] [\cite=fs3] for details).

A short remark about the proof of Theorem A is in order. A definably complete structure does not need to be complete in the topological sense. For this reason the strategy of the classical proof of the Baire Category Theorem to define a sequence of real numbers by recursion is not viable in our setting, as such a sequence might not converge. However, by [\cite=fornasiero] (see Fact 3 below) it is enough to consider a definable complete [formula] that defines a closed and discrete set which is mapped by a definable function onto a dense subset of K. In such a situation techniques are available that are based on the idea of definable approximation schemes first used by the author in [\cite=discrete]. These ideas allow us to replace the use of recursion in the classical proof by an explicit definition of an appropriate sequence.

Notation

In the rest of the paper [formula] will always be a fixed definably complete expansion of an ordered field K. When we say a set is definable in [formula], we always mean definable with parameters from [formula]. We will use a,b,c for elements of K. The letters d,e will always denote elements of a discrete set D. Given a subset X of Kn  ×  Km and a∈Kn, we denote the set {b:(a,b)∈X} by Xa. We write [formula] for the topological closure of X in the usual order topology.

Facts about definably complete fields

In this section we recall several facts about definably complete expansions of ordered fields. For more details and background, see [\cite=ivp]. Let [formula] be a definably complete expansion of an ordered field.

Let Y  ⊆  K be a non-empty closed set definable in [formula]. Then Y contains a minimum and a maximum iff Y is bounded.

Let Y  ⊆  K2 be definable in [formula] such that Ya is closed and bounded and [formula] for every a,b∈K with a < b. Then [formula].

We say that [formula] is definably Baire if it satisfies the conclusion of Theorem A. The proof of Theorem A uses the following result of Fornasiero as a starting point.

If [formula] is not definably Baire, then there exists an unbounded, closed and discrete set D  ⊆  K≥  0 and a function f:D  →  K such that f is definable in [formula] and f(D) is dense in K.

The strategy for the proof of Theorem A is to establish the following statement: A definably complete expansion of an order field that defines an unbounded, closed and discrete set which is mapped by a definable function onto a dense set, is definably Baire. Note that there are many instances where we already know Theorem A holds. Since [formula] is a Baire space, every expansion of the real field is definably Baire. Moreover, any o-minimal expansion of an ordered field is definably Baire. For more examples in this direction and related results for expansions of ordered groups, see Dolich, Miller and Steinhorn [\cite=dms].

Proof of Theorem A

Let [formula] be a definably complete expansion of an ordered field (K, < , + ,  ·  ). Towards a contradiction, we assume that there is an increasing family (Yt)t∈K> 0 of definable nowhere dense sets such that [formula]. Set [formula]. Define [formula]. Then Xt is dense in K. By replacing Yt by its topological closure, we can assume that Xt is open. By Fact [\ref=forn] there is also an unbounded, closed and discrete set D  ⊆  K≥  0 definable in [formula] and a map f:D  →  K definable in [formula] such that the image of D under f is dense in K. Since D is cofinal in K> 0,

[formula]

Let [formula] be the function that maps c to the largest [formula] such that c∈Xd. Note that β is unbounded. Further let γ:K  →  [0,1] map c∈K to the supremum of the set of elements b in (0,1) such that [formula]. Since Xβ(c) is open, γ(c) > 0. We will write Ic for the open interval [formula]. We will use the following properties of β and γ.

Let c∈K. Then

[formula]

Let c∈K. Define Sc  ⊆  D as the set

[formula]

Moreover, let Sβc  ⊆  D be

[formula]

The elements of the set Sc can be interpreted as the set of best approximations of c from the right. Compare this to the approximation arguments used in [\cite=discrete]. Note that Sc is always unbounded, because it does not contain a maximum. The set Sβc is always non-empty for every c∈K, since it contains the minimum of Sc. But a priori there is no reason why Sβc should be unbounded. In fact, it might even be finite for some c∈K. The advantage of Sβc over Sc is that the composition [formula] is strictly increasing on Sβc.

Let δ:K  →  D be the function that maps c to the largest d∈Sβc such that for all e1,e2∈Sβc with e1 < e2  ≤  d

[formula]

Define Jc  ⊆  K by

[formula]

The function δ is well-defined.

Let c∈K. Towards a contradiction, suppose that δ(c) is not defined. Then Sβc is unbounded by Fact [\ref=unbounded] and for all e1,e2∈Sβc with e1 < e2

[formula]

Then for every e∈Sβc the set

[formula]

contains f(e), and hence is non-empty and closed. By Fact [\ref=closedunion] and Lemma [\ref=lemma4]

[formula]

Since Sβc is unbounded and [formula] is strictly increasing on Sβc, the set {β(f(e)):e∈Sβc} does not contain a maximum. Thus by Fact [\ref=unbounded] it is unbounded. Hence it is cofinal in D and

[formula]

This is a contradiction, since [formula] is empty.

Let c∈K. Then Jc is a non-empty open interval.

Let d1∈D be the largest element of [formula] such that

[formula]

is a non-empty open interval. Such an element exists, since Sβc is non-empty and Ia is a non-empty open interval for every a∈K. Towards a contradiction, suppose that d1  <  δ(c). Let d2∈D be the smallest element in [formula] larger than d1. Since d2  ≤  δ(c), f(d2)∈If(e) for all e∈Sβc with e < d2. Hence

[formula]

is a non-empty open interval. This is a contradiction to the maximality of d1. Hence d1  =  δ(c).

Note that for every c∈K

[formula]

In order to find a counter-example to the statement [formula], we will amalgamate sets of the form [formula]. For this purpose we introduce the following notion of an extension.

For c1,c2∈K, we say that c2 extends c1 if δ(c1)  <  δ(c2) and

[formula]

In the following we will construct an unbounded definable subset E0 of D such that for all d,e∈E0 with d < e, f(e) extends f(d). Given such a set E0, we will be able create a contradiction as in the proof of Lemma [\ref=welldef] (see proof of Theorem A below). With that goal in mind, we start by establishing several properties of extensions. First note that being an extension is transitive. If c3 extends c2 and c2 extends c1, then c3 extends c1.

Let c1,c2∈K be such that c2 extends c1. Then

Jc2  ⊆  Jc1, and

β(f(δ(c2)))  >  β(f(δ(c1))).

(i) Since c2 extends c1, [formula]. Hence Jc2  ⊆  Jc1. (ii) Since c2 extends c1, δ(c1)∈Sβc2. Since [formula] is strictly increasing on Sβc2, β(f(δ(c2)))  >  β(f(δ(c1))).

Let c∈K and d∈D. If the set

[formula]

is non-empty, then it contains a maximum.

Suppose L is non-empty. Then the set

[formula]

is bounded and non-empty. Thus it contains a maximum, say e3. By the definition, the image of e3 under f is the maximum of L.

Let c∈K. Then there exists d∈D such that f(d) extends c.

By Lemma [\ref=nonemptyopen], the set

[formula]

is a non-empty open interval. We will construct d,d1∈D such that f(d1)∈A, f(d) extends c and d1 is the smallest element in Sβf(d) larger than δ(c). Because f(d1)∈A, d1 witnesses that δ(f(d)) > δ(c).

Since f(D) is dense in K, we can define d1∈D as the smallest element in D such that f(d1)∈A and β(f(d1))  >  β(f(δ(c)). Since c < f(d1) < f(δ(c)) and δ(c)∈Sc, we have d1  >  δ(c). We now choose d. By Lemma [\ref=maxleft], the set

[formula]

has a maximum, say f(d2) for some d2∈D. By density of f(D), we can choose d∈D such that [formula].

Since c < f(d) < f(δ(c)),

[formula]

It is only left to establish that δ(f(d)) > δ(c). Since f(d1)∈A, it is enough to show that d1 is the smallest element in Sβf(d) larger than δ(c). By the choice of d, we have that for all e∈D with e < d1

[formula]

Hence d1∈Sf(d). Let e∈D be such that δ(c) < e  <  d1. We will show that e∉Sβf(d). This then directly implies that d1∈Sβf(d) and that d1 is the smallest such element larger than δ(c). By minimality of d1 either f(e)∉A or β(f(e))  ≤  β(f(δ(c)). In both cases we have to check that e∉Sβf(d). If β(f(e))  ≤  β(f(δ(c)), then e∉Sβf(d) because δ(c)∈Sβf(d) and [formula] is strictly increasing on Sβf(d). Now consider the case that f(e)∉A. Since A is an interval and [formula], either f(e) < f(d1) or f(e)  ≥  f(δ(c)). If f(e)  ≥  f(δ(c)), then e∉Sβf(d) because δ(c)∈Sβf(d). If f(e)  <  f(d1), then f(e) < f(d) by [\eqref=eq1]. Hence e∉Sβf(d). Hence d1 is the smallest element in Sβf(d) larger than δ(c).

Define E as the set of e∈D such that there is no d∈D with d < e and

[formula]

The set E is defined in a way to make sure that if e∈E, d∈D and f(d) extends f(e), then e < d.

Let c∈K. The set {e∈E:f(e)c} is unbounded.

Let d1∈D be the smallest element in D such that f(d1) extends c. It is easy to see that d1∈E. Towards a contradiction, suppose there exists e∈E such that e is the largest element in E such that f(e) extends c. By Proposition [\ref=onestep], let d∈D be the smallest element of D such that f(d) extends f(e). Because e∈E, d > e. Since f(e) extends c, so does f(d). Moreover, since e∈E and d is the smallest element in D such that f(d) extends f(e), d is in E as well. This contradicts the maximality of e. Hence the set {e∈E:f(e)c} is unbounded.

Let d1,d2,d3∈D be such that d2∈E and d1 < d2 < d3. If f(d3) extends f(d1) and f(d3) extends f(d2), then f(d2) extends f(d1).

Towards a contradiction, suppose that δ(f(d2))  ≤  δ((f(d1)). Since f(d3) extends both f(d1) and f(d2),

[formula]

This contradicts d2∈E. Hence δ(f(d2))  >  δ(f(d1)) and

[formula]

Let d0 be the smallest element in E. Define E0  ⊆  E as the set of elements d of E satisfying the following two properties:

either f(d) extends f(d0) or d = d0,

if there are e1,e2∈E such that d0  ≤  e1  <  d, f(d) extends f(e1) and e2 is the smallest element in E larger than e1 such that f(e2) extends f(e1), then either d = e2 or f(d) extends f(e2).

The set E0 is definable in [formula], since both E and the property of being an extension are definable in [formula].

Let d∈E0. If e is the smallest element in E larger than d such that f(e) extends f(d), then e∈E0.

Since f(e) extends f(d), f(e) extends f(d0). Let e1,e2∈E be such that d0  ≤  e1 < e, f(e) extends f(e1) and e2 is the smallest element in E larger than e1 such that f(e2) extends f(e1). If e1 = d, we get e2 = e by minimality of e. If e1  <  d, then f(d) extends f(e1) by Lemma [\ref=preextends]. Since d∈E0, either d = e2 or f(d) extends f(e2). Thus f(e) extends f(e2). Hence we can reduce to the case that e1  >  d. Since f(e) extends both f(d) and f(e1), f(e1) extends f(d) by Lemma [\ref=preextends]. But then e1 = e by the minimality of e. Hence e∈E0.

Let d,e∈E0. If d < e, then f(e) extends f(d).

Consider the set

[formula]

It is enough to show that Z is unbounded. Since d0∈Z by definition of E0, Z is non-empty. For a contradiction, suppose d1∈D is the largest element in Z. Let d2 be the smallest element in E such that f(d2) extends f(d1). By Lemma [\ref=preextends2], d2∈E0. For every e∈E0 with e  >  d1, either e = d2 or f(e) extends f(d2) by definition of E0. Hence d2∈Z. This contradicts the maximality of d1.

We will show that

[formula]

This contradicts the assumption that the family (Yd)d∈D witnesses that [formula] is not definably Baire, and hence establishes Theorem A. By Proposition [\ref=extends2] and Lemma [\ref=remark1], we have for all d1,d2∈E0 with d1 < d2

[formula]

By Fact [\ref=closedunion],

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=extends] and [\ref=preextends2], the set E0 has no maximum and hence is unbounded by Fact [\ref=unbounded]. Hence {β(f(δ(f(d)))):d∈E0} is unbounded as well by Proposition [\ref=extends2] and Lemma [\ref=remark1]. Thus the set [formula] is equal to [formula] and in particular non-empty.
