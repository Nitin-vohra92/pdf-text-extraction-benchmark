Restriction maps in equivariant K K-theory.

Introduction

Let G be a compact Lie group and let X be a finite G-CW-complex. For any closed subgroup H  ≤  G, we have a restriction functor in equivariant K-theory:

[formula]

As an application of the generalized Atiyah-Segal completion theorem of [\cite=MR935523], McClure proved the following.

Combining with Jackowski's result [\cite=MR0448377], one obtains the following.

We extend these to bivariant K-theory as follows.

Let G be a compact Lie group and A and B be G-C*-algebras. Suppose that K KHn(A,B) is a finitely generated R(G)-module for every H  ≤  G closed and [formula].

Then, if K KF*(A,B)  =  0 for all F  ≤  G finite cyclic, then K KG*(A,B)  =  0.

Suppose, in addition, that K KFn(A,B) is a finitely generated group for all F  ≤  G finite and [formula]. Then, if x∈K KG(A,B) restricts to zero in K KH(A,B) for all H  ≤  G finite, then x  =  0.

See [\cite=MR2083579] for a dual result for restriction maps in K-homology of spaces with actions of discrete groups.

Theorem [\ref=thm_KK] is in stark contrast to the results of Heath Emerson, where he showed that even for circle actions, noncommutative algebras can behave very differently from commutative ones. [\cite=2010arXiv1004.2970E]

In fact, we prove the following. This is done mainly for clarity, but as an added bonus, we see that Theorem [\ref=thm_KK] holds for equivariant E-theory as well.

Let G be a compact Lie group and let [formula] be an RO(G)-gradable module theory over [formula]. Suppose that [formula] is a finitely generated R(G)-module for every H  ≤  G closed and [formula]. Let X be a finite based G-CW-complex.

Then, if [formula] for all F  ≤  G finite cyclic, then [formula].

Suppose, in addition, that [formula] is a finitely generated group for all F  ≤  G finite and [formula]. Then, if [formula] restricts to zero in [formula] for all H  ≤  G finite, then x  =  0.

The proof follows [\cite=MR862427] very closely. In Section [\ref=sec_RO(G)], we show that Theorem [\ref=thm_L] implies Theorem [\ref=thm_KK]. In Section [\ref=sec_Completion], we extend the generalized Atiyah-Segal completion theorem of [\cite=MR935523], supplying the missing ingredient needed to finish the proof in Section [\ref=sec_Proof_of_main_thm].

RO(G)-graded cohomology theories

Let G be a compact Lie group. A based G-space is a G-space with a G-fixed base point. In the rest of the paper, we assume that all G-spaces are G-CW-complexes and all cohomology theories are equivariant and reduced cohomology theories.

For a finite-dimensional representation V of G, we write SV for the one-point compactification of V, considered a based G-space with base point the point at infinity.

RO(G;U)-gradable theories

We fix a complete universe U. (cf. [\cite=MR1413302]).

An RO(G)-graded cohomology theory is an RO(G;U)-graded cohomology theory in the sense of [\cite=MR1413302]. A [formula]-graded cohomology theory is an RO(G;UG)-graded cohomology theory (any trivial universe would work). We say that a [formula]-graded cohomology theory is RO(G)-gradable if it is the [formula]-graded part of an RO(G)-graded theory.

Let [formula] be a [formula]-graded cohomology theory. For a closed subgroup H  ≤  G and a based H-CW-complex X, we define

[formula]

Then [formula] is a [formula]-graded cohomology theory on based H-spaces. If X is actually a based G-CW-complex, then we have a natural G-equivariant identification

[formula]

and the collapse map G / H  →    *   gives rise to a natural transformation

[formula]

called the restriction map.

Bivariant K-theory

The following is the main example we have in mind. First note that [formula] is an RO(G)-graded commutative ring theory with [formula] and [formula].

Let G be a compact Lie group and let A and B be G-C*-algebras. For a finite based G-CW-complex X and finite-dimensional real representation V of G, we define

[formula]

Then the following holds.

[formula] defines an RO(G)-graded cohomology theory on the category of finite based G-CW-complexes.

[formula] extends to an RO(G)-graded cohomology theory on the category of based G-CW-complexes.

[formula] is a module theory over [formula].

(i) See [\cite=MR918241]. (ii) By Adams' representation theorem [\cite=MR1413302], [formula] is represented by an Ω-G-prespectrum, hence extends to an RO(G)-graded cohomology theory on the category of G-CW-complexes. See [\cite=MR1193150]. (iii) The module structure

[formula]

is given by the Kasparov product

[formula]

It is well-known that for H  ≤  G,

[formula]

and the restriction map is induced by G / H+  →  S0. Hence we obtain the following corollary.

Suppose that Theorem [\ref=thm_L] holds. Then Theorem [\ref=thm_KK] holds.

Atiyah-Segal Completion

First we abstract the main finiteness condition from Theorem [\ref=thm_L].

Let R be a unital commutative ring and let [formula] be a [formula]-graded cohomology theory with values in R-modules. We say that [formula] is finite over R if [formula] is a finitely generated R-module for every finite based G-CW-complex X and [formula].

Clearly, this is equivalent to asking that [formula] is a finitely generated R-module for H  ≤  G.

Let G be a compact Lie group and let R be a unital commutative ring. Let [formula] be a [formula]-graded cohomology theory with values in R-modules. Suppose that R is Noetherian and [formula] is finite over R. Then for any family I of ideals in R, the following defines a [formula]-graded cohomology theory with values in pro-R-modules:

[formula]

where Y  ⊆  X runs over the finite based G-CW-subcomplexes of X and J runs over the finite products of ideals in I.

Note that in this lemma, it is enough to have [formula] to be a cohomology theory on finite based G-CW-complexes (only finite wedges are considered in the additivity axiom).

Exactness follows from the Artin-Rees lemma. See the proof of [\cite=MR935524].

Bott Periodicity

Let V be a complex G-representation. By Bott periodicity [\cite=MR0228000], [formula] is a free [formula]-module generated by the Bott element [formula]. The Euler class of V is defined to be [formula], where e:S0  →  SV is the obvious map.

Let [formula] be an RO(G)-graded module theory over [formula]. Then for any complex representation V, multiplication by the Bott element [formula] gives an isomorphism

[formula]

If V  ⊆  W are complex representations and i:SV  →  SW is the inclusion, then the following diagram commutes

[formula]

Let [formula] denote the inverse Bott element: it has the property that

[formula]

Then multiplication by λ- 1V gives the inverse map

[formula]

The second statement is shown for [formula] in [\cite=MR935523]. The general case follows by functoriality.

Completion

A class of subgroups of G closed under subconjugacy is called a family. A family C of subgroups of G determines a class, again denoted C, of ideals of R(G) by the kernels of the restriction maps:

[formula]

hence a topology on any R(G)-module.

The following is a straightforward generalization of [\cite=MR935523].

Let G be a compact Lie group and let [formula] be an RO(G)-gradable module theory over [formula], which is finite over R(G).

Let C be a family of subgroups of G. For any based G-CW-complex X, if [formula] for all H∈C, then [formula]

By [\cite=MR0248277], [formula] is Noetherian. Hence, by Lemma [\ref=lem_cohomology], [formula] is a cohomology theory.

Now the proof of [\cite=MR935523] carries over ad verbatum, once we extend Bott periodicity to [formula] as in Lemma [\ref=lem_Bott].

Let EC denote the classifying space of C. For any finite based G-CW-complex X, the projection map EC+  →  S0 gives completion

[formula]

where Y runs over finite based subcomplexes of EC+.

The inverse system [formula] satisfies the Mittag-Leffler condition and [formula] is C-complete for any finite based subcomplex Y  ⊂  EC+ (cf. [\cite=MR935523]).

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm_L]

F-spaces

Let F be a family of subgroups of G. We say that a based G-CW-complex X is an F-space if all the isotropy groups, except at the base point, are in F. The following lemma says that in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm_L], we may assume that X is an F-space, for any F containing all finite cyclic subgroups of G.

Let G be a compact Lie group and let [formula] be an RO(G)-gradable module theory over [formula], which is finite over R(G).

Let F be a family containing all finite cyclic subgroups of G. Then for any finite based G-CW-complex X, the top horizontal map in the commutative diagram

[formula]

is injective. Here Y runs over the finite based subcomplexes of EF+, the horizontal maps are induced by the projections [formula] and the vertical maps are restrictions.

The F-topology on [formula] is Hausdorff by [\cite=MR862427]. Hence, the claim follows from Corollary [\ref=cor_AS].

Let C denote the family of finite cyclic subgroups of G.

By assumption, [formula] for all F∈C. Let Y be a finite based G-CW-complex, which is a C-space. Then the zero skeleton Y0 and the skeletal quotients Yn / Yn - 1 are finite wedges of G-spaces of the form [formula] with F∈C. It follows that [formula]. Hence by Lemma [\ref=lem_F-space], [formula].

Induction

We write OG for the category whose objects are orbit spaces G / H, where H  ≤  G is a closed subgroup, and whose morphisms are homotopy classes of G-maps.

Recall that a compact Lie group is said to cyclic if it has a topological generator (an element whose powers are dense) and hyperelementary if it is an extension of a cyclic group by a finite p-group.

We write H for the class of hyperelementary subgroups of G and let OH denote the full subcategory of OG of orbits G / H with H subconjugate to a subgroup in H.

Let G be a compact Lie group and let [formula] be an RO(G)-gradable module theory over [formula]. Then, for any based G-CW-complex, the restriction maps induce an isomorphism

[formula]

Follows from Propositions 2.1 and 2.2 of [\cite=MR862427].

For any abelian group M, let [formula] denote its adic completion lim nM / nM.

Let F denote the family of finite subgroups of G.

By Lemma [\ref=lem_ind], we may assume that G is a hyperelementary group and by Lemma [\ref=lem_F-space], we may assume that X an F-space.

Let G be a hyperelementary group and X an F-space. Then the restriction map

[formula]

is an isomorphism by [\cite=MR862427]. By [\cite=MR862427], the adic topologies on [formula] and [formula] are Hausdorff. This completes the proof.
