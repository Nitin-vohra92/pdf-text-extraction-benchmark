Nullification of knots and links

Introduction and basic concepts

Historically, knots and links had been a subject of study almost only in the realm of pure mathematics. That has dramatically changed since the discovery of knots and links formed in circular DNA a few decades ago. It turned out that the topology of the circular DNA plays a very important role in the properties of the DNA. Various geometric and topological complexity measures of DNA knots that are believed to be biologically relevant, such as the knot types, the 3D writhe, the average crossing numbers, the average radius of gyration, have been studied. In this paper, we are interested in another geometric/topological measure of knots and links called the nullification number, which is also believed to be biologically relevant [\cite=BuMa] [\cite=GrBrVaSiSh]. Intuitively, this number measures how easily a knotted circular DNA can unknot itself through recombination of its DNA strands. It turns out that there are several different ways to define such a number. These different definitions lead to different nullification numbers that are related. Our aim is to explore the mathematical properties of the nullification numbers. In this section, we will outline a brief introduction to basic knot theory concepts. In Section 2, we will give precise definitions for three different nullification numbers. In Section 3, we will study the nullification numbers for a well known class of knots called the class of Montesinos knots and links. In Section 4, we explore the relationships among the three nullification numbers, as well as their relationships with other knot invariants. In particular, we give examples to show that the three nullification numbers defined here are indeed different. In Section 5, we study a special class of links, namely the links whose general nullification number equals one. There we show that such links exist in abundance. In fact, the number of such links with crossing number less than or equal to n grows exponentially with respect to n.

Let K be a tame link, that is, K is a collection of several piece-wise smooth simple closed curves in [formula]. In the particular case that K contains only one component, it is called a knot instead. However through out this paper a link always includes the special case that it may be a knot, unless otherwise stated. A link is oriented if each component of the link has an orientation. Intuitively, if one can continuously deform a tame link K1 to another tame link K2 (in [formula]), then K1 and K2 are considered equivalent links in the topological sense. The corresponding continuous deformation is called an ambient isotopy, and K1, K2 are said to be ambient isotopic to each other. The set of all (tame) links that are ambient isotopic to each other is called a link type. For a fixed link (type) K, a link diagram of K is a projection of a member K∈K onto a plane. Such a projection p: K  ⊂  R3  →  D  ⊂  R2 is regular if the set of points {x∈D:|p- 1(x)| > 1} is finite and there is no x in D for which |p- 1(x)| > 2. In other words, in the diagram no more than two arcs of D cross at any point in the projection and there are only finitely many points where the arcs cross each other. A point where two arcs of D cross each other is called a crossing point, or just a crossing of D. The number of crossings in D not only depends on the link type K, it also depends on the geometrical shape of the member K representing K and the projection direction chosen. The minimum number of crossings in all regular projections of all members of K is called the crossing number of the link type K and is denoted by Cr(K). For any member K of K, we also write Cr(K) = Cr(K). Of course, by this definition, if K1 and K2 are of the same link type, then we have Cr(K1) = Cr(K2). However, it may be the case that for a member K of K, none of the regular projections of K has crossing number Cr(K). A diagram D of a link K∈K is minimum if the number of crossings in the diagram equals Cr(K). We will often call D a minimum projection diagram. A link diagram is alternating if one encounters over-passes and under-passes alternatingly when traveling along the link projection. A diagram D is said to be reducible if there exists a crossing point in D such that removing this crossing point makes the remaining diagram two disconnected parts. D is reduced if it is not reducible. A link is alternating if it has a reduced alternating diagram. A famous result derived from the Jones polynomial is that the crossing number of an alternating link K equals the number of crossings in any of its reduced alternating diagram since each diagram is minimum. For example the diagram of the knot K1 in Figure [\ref=composite] is minimum.

A link K is called a composite link if a member of it can be obtained by cutting open two nontrivial links K1 and K2 and reconnecting the strings as shown in Figure [\ref=composite]. The resulting link is written as K = K1  #  K2 and K1, K2 are called the connected sum components of K. Of course a link can have more than two connected sum components. A link K that is not a composite link is called a prime link.

In the case of alternating links, any two minimum projection diagrams D and D' of the same alternating link K are flype equivalent, that is, D can be changed to D' through a finite sequence of flypes [\cite=MT1] [\cite=MT2] (see Figure [\ref=flype]).

Let c be a crossing in an alternating diagram D. The flyping circuit of c is defined as the unique decomposition of D into crossings [formula], m  ≥  1 and tangle diagrams [formula], r  ≥  0 joined together as shown in Figure [\ref=flypingcircuit] such that (i) c = ci for some i and (ii) the Ti are minimum with respect to the pattern.

Definitions of Nullification Numbers

Let D be a regular diagram of an oriented link K. A crossing in D is said to be smoothed if the strands of D at the crossing are cut and re-connected as shown in Figure [\ref=smooth]. If every crossing in D is smoothed, the result will be a collection of disjoint (topological) circles without self intersections. These are called the Seifert circles of D. Of course the set of Seifert circles of D represents a trivial link diagram. However, it is not necessary to smooth every crossing of D to make it a trivial link diagram. For example, if a diagram has only one crossing, or only two crossing with only one component, then the diagram is already a trivial link diagram. So the minimum number of crossings needed to be smoothed in order to turn D into a trivial link diagram is strictly less than the number of crossings in D. This minimum number is called the nullification number of the diagram D, which we will write as nD. Notice that nD is not a link invariant since different diagrams (of the same link) may have different nullification numbers. In order to define a number that is a link invariant, we would have to consider the set of all diagrams of a link. Depending on how we choose to smooth the crossings in the process, we may then get different versions of nullification numbers. This approach is in a way similar to the how different versions of unknotting numbers are defined in [\cite=DES].

Let K be an oriented link and D be a (regular) diagram of K. Choose some crossings in D and smooth them. This results in a new diagram [formula] which is most likely of a different link type other than K. Suppose we are allowed to deform [formula] (without changing its link type, of course) to a new diagram D1. We can then again choose some crossings in D1 to smooth and repeat this process. With proper choices of the new diagrams and the crossings to be smoothed, it is easy to see that this process can always terminate into a trivial link diagram. The minimum number of crossings required to be smoothed in order to make any diagram D of K into a trivial link diagram by the above procedure is then defined as the general nullification number of K, or just the nullification number of K. We will denote it by n(K).

On the other hand, if in the above nullification procedure, we require that the diagrams used at each step be minimum diagrams (of their corresponding link types), then the minimum number of crossings required to be smoothed in order to make any minimum diagram D of K into a trivial link diagram is defined as the restricted nullification number of K, which we will denote by nr(K).

In the case that D is a minimum diagram of K, we have already defined the nullification number nD for the diagram D, namely the minimum number of smoothing moves needed to change D into a trivial link diagram. If we take the minimum of nD over all minimum diagrams of K, then we obtain a third nullification number of K, which we will call the diagram nullification number of K and will denoted it by nd(K).

By the above definitions, clearly we have

[formula]

We shall see later that these definitions of nullification numbers are indeed all different. Of the three nullification numbers, the diagram nullification number nd(K) has been studied in [\cite=C] [\cite=S]. Specifically, in [\cite=S] it is shown that for an alternating link K, the diagram nullification number nd(K) can be computed from any reduced alternating diagram D of K using the following formula:

[formula]

where s(D) is the number of Seifert circles in D. This allows us to express the genus g(K) of an alternating link K in terms of the number of Seifert circles and the nullification number by

[formula]

where ν is the number of components of K. On the other hand, the diagram nullification number nd for alternating links is closely related to the HOMFLY polynomial by the following lemma. This provides an expression of nd without having to make reference to a particular diagram.

Let K be an alternating non-split link, then nD(K) = βz, where βz is the maximum degree of the variable z in the HOMFLY polynomial [formula] of K.

The result of Lemma [\ref=nDrelationtopoly] is given in [\cite=S]. In the following we give a short proof of the lemma, since a proof was not given in [\cite=S]. For more and detailed information regarding HOMFLY polynomial and other facts in knot theory, please refer to a standard text in knot theory such as [\cite=Crom].

For any link K with diagram D we have the inequality βz  ≤  Cr(D) - s(D) + 1. The Conway polynomial [formula] of K is related to [formula] by the equation [formula]. It follows that the maximum degree αz of z in [formula] is at most βz. Since K is alternating, αz = 2g(K) + μ - 1, where g(K) is the genus of K and μ is the number of components of K. Using the Seifert algorithm on a reduced alternating diagram of K we get

[formula]

Now it follows that

[formula]

Thus βz  =  αz = Cr(D) - s(D) + 1 = nD(K).

In general, if D is a diagram of some non-alternating link, then we have nD  ≤  Cr(D) - s(D) + 1, but the precise determination of nD (hence nd(K)) is far more difficult. In the following we propose a different inequality concerning nD using the concept of parallel and anti-parallel crossings. A flyping circuit is said to be nontrivial if it either contains more than one crossing or more than one tangle. Otherwise it is called a trivial flyping circuit. If a crossing is part of a nontrivial flyping circuit then the crossing belongs to a unique flyping circuit [\cite=calvo]. If there is more than one crossing in a flyping circuit of an oriented link diagram, then the crossings in the flyping circuit are called parallel or anti-parallel as shown in Figure [\ref=parandntipar].

Note that we can assign the notion of parallel or anti-parallel even to a single crossing as long as the flyping circuit has at least two tangles. For trivial flyping circuits that consist of a single crossing and a single tangle there is no obvious way of assigning a notion of parallel or anti-parallel to it. A nontrivial flyping circuit has the special property that all the crossings in it can be eliminated by nullifying (i.e. smoothing) a single crossing if the crossings are anti-parallel, while all crossings in it have to be smoothed (in order to eliminate them with nullifying moves within the circuit) when the crossings are parallel. Let P1, P2, ..., Pm be the nontrivial flyping circuits with parallel crossings and let |Pi| be the number of crossings in Pi. Let A be number of nontrivial flyping circuits with anti-parallel crossings and S be the total number of crossings in all trivial flyping circuits. We conjecture that for any link diagram D

[formula]

where c  ≤  1 is an additional constant depending on the link type of D. For alternating diagrams, we expect an almost equality in ([\ref=ineqfornD]), while for non-alternating diagrams ([\ref=ineqfornD]) may still be a large overestimate. Figure [\ref=mathknot11a263] shows the case of a minimum diagram for the knot 11a263. There are four visible nontrivial flyping circuits (three of which have 3 crossings and one with two crossings) and all crossings in the circuits are parallel and each crossing belong to one such circuit. It follows that A = S = 0 and [formula]. Thus ([\ref=ineqfornD]) becomes an equality with the choice of c = 1 since nD = 8. This example shows that it is necessary for us to have the constant c term in general.

Diagram Nullification Numbers of 4-plats and Montesinos Links

In this section we discuss the nullification number nD of 4-plats and Montesinos links. The goal is to show that the inequality in ([\ref=ineqfornD]) holds for these links.

A 4-plat is a link with up to two components that admits a minimum alternating diagram as shown in Figure [\ref=4plat] where a grey box marked by ci indicates a row of ci horizontal half-twists. Such a link is completely defined by such a vector [formula] of positive integer entries. Obviously, two vectors of the form [formula] and [formula] define the same link. However, it is much less obvious that two such vectors define different 4-plats if they are not reversal of each other. For a detailed discussion on the classification of 4-plats see [\cite=BZ] [\cite=Crom]. In a standard 4-plat diagram there is an obvious way to assign the notion of parallel or anti-parallel to a single crossing, based on if both strings move in the same right-left direction.

A similar schema based on a vector [formula] is used to classify rational tangles. A tangle T is part of a link diagram that consists of a disk that contains two properly embedded arcs. For a typical rational tangle diagram see Figure [\ref=tanglediagram] where the rectangular box contains either horizontal or vertical half-twists. A horizontal (vertical) rectangle labeled ai contains |ai| horizontal (vertical) half-twists and horizontal and vertical rectangles occur in an alternating fashion. All rational tangles end with an horizontal twists on the right. The ai's are either all positive or all negative, with the only exception that an may equal to zero. For a classification and precise definition of such tangles see [\cite=BZ] [\cite=Crom]. We assign the notion of parallel or anti-parallel to a single crossing, based on if both strings move in the same right-left direction for a horizontal crossing and based on if both strings move in the same up-down direction for a vertical crossing.

Each rational tangle [formula] defines a rational number β  /  α using the continued fraction expansion:

[formula]

Rational tangles are the basic building blocks of a large family of links called Montesinos links. A Montesinos link admits a diagram that consists of rational tangles Ti strung together as shown in Figure [\ref=montesionsLink] together with a horizontal number of |e| half-twists (as indicated by the rectangle in the figure). Such a diagram is called a Montesinos diagram. We say that a Montesinos diagram is of type I if the orientations between the two arcs connecting any two adjacent tangles in the diagram are parallel. In this case the orientations between the two arcs connecting any two other adjacent tangles in the diagram must be parallel as well. We say that diagram is of type II otherwise.

Let [formula] be the rational number whose continued fraction expansion is the vector that defines the rational tangle Ti. We will sometimes write [formula] as [formula]. It is known that a Montesinos link admits a Montesinos diagram satisfying the following additional condition: [formula] for each i (hence the continued fraction of [formula] is of the form [formula], where ai,j > 0). See [\cite=BZ] for an explanation of this and the classification of Montesinos links in general. For a Montesinos link K, let DK be a Montesinos diagram of K that satisfies this condition and let Pi be the set of indices i such that ai,j consists of parallel crossings and Ai be the set of indices i such that ai,j consists of anti-parallel crossings. We have the following theorem.

Let K be a Montesinos link with Montesinos diagram [formula], where [formula]. Then the number of Seifert circles in [formula] is given by the following formula

[formula]

where c = 2 if e = 0 and all tangles end with anti-parallel vertical twists, and c = 0 otherwise.

Consider one of the tangle diagrams [formula]. If the crossings corresponding to ai,j have parallel orientation, then the crossings correspond to ai,j - 1 and ai,j + 1 must have anti-parallel orientation. This can be seen as follows: Assume that ai,j represents |ai,j| vertical twists with a parallel orientation, see Figure [\ref=tangleconfiguration]. Assume further that both strings are oriented upwards. Then we have two strands entering the tangle marked by the dashed oval in Figure [\ref=tangleconfiguration] from below. Therefore the other two strands of that tangle must have an exiting orientation. This implies that the half-twists at ai,j - 1 and ai,j + 1 must be anti-parallel. A similar argument holds if ai,j represents horizontal twists with a parallel orientation.

Moreover, there is a Seifert circle that uses the boxes of all three entries ai,j - 1, ai,j and ai,j + 1 as shown in the Figure [\ref=tangleconfiguration]. This implies that the dashed arcs at the top left and bottom left of the tangle marked by the dashed oval in Figure [\ref=tangleconfiguration] must belong to the same Seifert circle. It is easy to see that these properties are the same if ai,j consists of horizontal twists.

Note that after nullification the two arcs in the tangle Ti are changed to a set of disjoint Seifert circles and two disjoint arcs connecting two of the four endpoints of the tangle. The Seifert circles generated be nullification can be grouped into three different categories. The first group consists of the small Seifert circles, namely those generated by two consecutive half-twists that are anti-parallel. Clearly, if |ai,j| > 1 and the corresponding crossings are anti-parallel, then there are |ai,j| - 1 such small circles. The second group consists of the medium sized Seifert circles, namely the Seifert circles that are not small but are contained within one of tangles Ti. The two Seifert circles shown in Figure [\ref=tangleconfiguration] are medium sized ones since they are contained in a tangle and involve parallel crossings. The third group consists of the rest of the Seifert circles. These are Seifert circles that involve more than one tangle and are called large Seifert circles. Figure [\ref=tangleconfiguration] also shows that for each ai,j that is parallel, one of the two arcs after nullification belongs to a medium Seifert circle and the other belongs to a large Seifert circle. The only exception occurs when ai,j consists of parallel half twists and is the last nonzero entry of the tangle, that is j = ni. In this case both arcs belong to large Seifert circles.

We have thus shown the following:

(i) There are [formula] small Seifert circles.

(ii) There are [formula] medium Seifert circles where p is the number of tangles Ti where ai,ni consists of parallel half twists.

If [formula] is of type I, then each ai,ni consists of anti-parallel twists and p = 0. Furthermore, e consists of parallel twists as well and it is easy to see that there are exactly two large Seifert circles. (One passes through all the tangles at the bottom and the other weaves through all tangles in a more complex path). This proves the first case of the theorem.

Now assume that [formula] is of type II. If a tangle Ti ends with parallel (anti-parallel) vertical twists then after nullification the arc with one end at the NW corner will connect to the SW corner (NE) corner. If we assume that e = 0 then we can see that after nullification there will be exactly p of the large Seifert circles when p is nonzero and exactly 2 if p = 0. If e  ≠  0 then there will be an additional |e| - 1 small circles and the number of large Seifert circles changes by minus one if p = 0 and increases by plus one if p  ≠  0. This proves the second case of the theorem.

Let K be the Montesinos link represented by the diagram [formula], where [formula] and e is an integer. Then we have

[formula]

where c = 2 if e = 0 and all tangles end with anti-parallel vertical twists, and c = 0 otherwise. Moreover if [formula] is alternating, then we have equality.

It suffices to prove the statement of equality for an alternating Montesinos link. In this case the Corollary follows from Theorem [\ref=T2] and the relationship nD(K) = Cr(D) - s(D) + 1 for any alternating reduced diagram D of the alternating K.

Since a 4-plat is a Montesinos link that contains only one rational tangle, we have the following. (Note that a 4-plat is also obtained if there are two rational tangles in the Montesinos link. However this is not important in this context, see [\cite=BZ].)

Let K be the 4-plat defined by the vector [formula], P be the set of indices i such that ai consists of parallel crossings and A be the set of indices i such that ai consists of anti-parallel crossings. Then

[formula]

Consider the 4-plat as the Montesinos link given by [formula], where [formula] and e = an. If an - 1 is zero then K is just an (e,2) torus link and the statement is true. If an - 1 is not zero then we apply Corollary [\ref=C1]. If [formula] is of type I then e is parallel and in the formula of Corollary [\ref=C1] we count e as parallel and |e| - 1 = |an| - 1 in the formula of the Corollary. If [formula] is of type II then e is anti-parallel and will be counted as the + 1 in Formula in Corollary [\ref=C1].

The Nullification Numbers and other Link Invariants

In this section we explore further the relationships among the three nullification numbers n(K), nr(K) and nd(K), as well as their relationships with some other link invariants.

The case of alternating links.

First let us consider the alternating links. We have the following theorem.

If K is an alternating link then we have nd(K) = nr(K).

Since we already have nr(K)  ≤  nd(K), it suffices to show that nr(K)  ≥  nd(K). Let cr(K) = n. Assume that nr(K) is obtained by smoothing crossings c1, c2,..., cm first in a reduced alternating diagram D of K. This results in a diagram D1 with n - m crossings that is still alternating. Assume further that nr(K) is obtained by deforming D1 to a minimum diagram D2 and some crossings in it are then smoothed. D2 is necessarily alternating since D1 is alternating and D2 share the same knot type with D1. On the other hand, D1 can be changed to a reduced alternating diagram [formula] by performing all possible reduction moves as shown in Figure [\ref=RMonereduction]. [formula] is also minimum since it is reduced and is alternating. Thus it is flype equivalent to the diagram D2. Note that for each crossing reduction move as shown in Figure [\ref=RMonereduction], one crossing is removed and the number of Seifert circles is reduced by one at the same time. Thus [formula]. Therefore no reduction in the number of nullification steps can be gained by moving to the diagram D2. Since D2 is still alternating, moving to other minimum diagrams after smoothing some crossings in it will not result in a nullification number reduction either by the same argument.

On the other hand, even for alternating links, the difference between n(K) and nr(K) can be as large as one wants.

For any given positive integer m, there exists an alternating knot K such that n(K) - nr(K) = n(K) - nd(K) > m.

As shown in Figure [\ref=nullification4Plat], the 4-plats of the vector form ( - k, - 2, - 1,2,k) all have general nullification number one, where k is any positive integer.

Notice that ( - k, - 2, - 1,2,k) can be isotoped to (1,k - 1,3,1,k) as shown in Figure [\ref=4platexample], which is alternating. Thus we have an alternating knot K with general nullification number one. For the minimum diagram of K given in Figure [\ref=4platexample] we have, by Corollary [\ref=4plats] or equation [\ref=solaeq], nr(K) = nd(K) = (2k + 4) - 5 + 1 = 2k. So the difference between the diagram nullification number and the general nullification number is > m if k > (m + 1) / 2.

The case of non-alternating links.

In order to show that nr(K) and nd(K) are indeed different in general, we need to demonstrate the existence of knots/links K such that nr(K) < nd(K). Because of Theorem [\ref=alterNull], such examples can only be found in non-alternating knots and links. Worse, there are no known methods or easy approaches in finding such examples. This subsection is thus devoted to the construction of one single such example.

First, let us observe that the knot 820 has the following special property. The left of Figure [\ref=820isotopy] shows that nd(820) = nr(820) = nd(820) = 1. However, after applying a simply isotopy as shown on the right side of Figure [\ref=820isotopy], the new diagram can no longer be nullified by smoothing only one crossing. One has to smooth two crossings.

Now we would like to construct an example using this observation. We construct a three component link L by adding two simple closed curves to N as shown in Figure [\ref=speciallink] (drawn by thickened lines). The diagram DL of Figure [\ref=speciallink] can be shown to be adequate hence is minimum [\cite=Crom]. Assign the orientations to the components as shown in Figure [\ref=speciallink].

It is easy to see that nullifying the two adjacent crossings marked in Figure [\ref=speciallink] allows the new components to be removed by an ambient isotopy. The resulting diagram is N which can be further isotoped to M. Thus by the definition of nr we have nr(L)  ≤  3.

Lacking a more elegant method, we took a programmatic approach for the confirmation that nD(L) > 3. First, we observe that the diagram of Figure [\ref=speciallink] is the only minimum diagram of L up to trivial isotopies. This follows from the fact that if we remove either one of the new components we obtain an alternating and hence minimum diagram that admits no flypes. Thus any diagram of such a two component link has to look like the one shown. The two additional components are "parallel" and therefore the only change we can make is to exchange them. This however does not change the diagram. We then implemented the nullification procedure which yielded all knot/link diagrams obtained by all possible combinations of 3 or less crossing smoothing steps on DL. Using a Gauss code modification program and the Mathematica© KnotTheory package's Jones polynomial computation we were able to verify that none of these resulted in a knot/link with the polynomial of a trivial knot/link. Since nd(L)  ≤  4 by our construction of L, we have shown that nd(L) = 4. Thus we have shown an example of a three component link L with nr(L)  ≤  3 and nd(L) = 4.

The genus, unknotting number and the signature vs n(K).

There is a simple inequality between the nullification number and the unknotting number:

Let K be any knot then n(K)  ≤  2u(K), where u denotes the unknotting number of a knot.

Proof: It suffices to show that a strand passage can be realized by two nullification moves. This is shown in Figure [\ref=strandpassage].

The next theorem shows that an inequality as given in Lemma [\ref=unknot] does not exist the other way around, that is the unknotting number can not be bound from above by a multiple of the general nullification number.

For any given positive integer m, (1) there exists an alternating knot K such that g(K) - n(K) > m where g(K) is the genus of K and (2) there exists a link K such that u(K) - n(K) > m. In other words, the general nullification number does not impose a general upper bound on the genus and the unknotting number of a link.

Notice that the genus of the knot K in Figure [\ref=4platexample] is k. Thus if k > m + 1, then g(K) - n(K) = k - 1 > m. For the second part of the theorem, consider the torus link T(3n,3) (n is an arbitrary positive integer) as shown in Figure [\ref=toruslink], in which two of the three components are oriented in parallel (say clockwise) and the third component is oriented in the other direction (say counterclockwise). By nullifying any one of the crossings between two components with opposite orientations in Figure [\ref=toruslink] we obtain the unlink. Thus n(T(3n,3)) = 1. On the other hand, by the Bennequin Conjecture [\cite=Ben] [\cite=Wei], the unknotting number of T(3n,3) is 3n and the result of the second part of the theorem follows.

The signature σ(K) of a link K is defined as the signature of the matrix M + MT where M is the Seifert matrix obtained from any regular diagram of K. The definition and computation of a Seifert matrix is beyond the scope of this paper and we refer the reader to any standard text in knot theory such as [\cite=BZ] [\cite=Crom].

For any oriented link K we have n(K)  ≥  |σ(K)|.

We use an approach similar to the one used in the proof of Theorem 6.8.2 in [\cite=Crom] (where the relationship between the signature and the unknotting number is investigated). We will need the following lemma [\ref=sigmaseries] from [\cite=Jones]. A σ-series of an n  ×  n matrix of rank r is a sequence of submatrices Δi such that (i) Δi is an i  ×  i matrix; (ii) Δi is obtained from Δi + 1 by removing a single row and a single column; and (iii) no two consecutive matrices Δi and Δi + 1 are singular when i < r.

[\cite=Jones] Let A be a symmetric n  ×  n matrix with a σ-series as described above. Put Δi = 1. Then the signature of A is given by

[formula]

where  sgn() is the sign function.

Let D+, D- and D0 be three link diagrams that are identical except at one crossing as shown in Figure [\ref=skeinrelation] and let L+, L- and L0 be their corresponding link types, we claim that

[formula]

To prove this, let F+, F- and F0 be the projection surfaces constructed from D+, D- and D0, respectively. Let M+, M- and M0 be the Seifert matrices constructed from these surfaces. If F0 is disconnected then L+ and L- are isotopic links equivalent to a connected sum L1  #  L2 for some links L1 and L2. Therefore in this case [formula] and σ(L+) - σ(L0) = σ(L-) - σ(L0) = 0.

If F0 is connected then F+ and F- are obtained from F0 by adding a twisted rectangle at the crossing that is switched or eliminated. Therefore the Seifert matrices M+ and M- have one additional column and row added to the Seifert matrix M0 as shown below for M+ where b is an additional loop that passed through the added rectangle and back through the rest of the surface F0 and [formula] is a basis for H1(F0).

We write A* = M* + MT* where *  =  + , -  or 0. The matrices A* may not be singular, however they are non-singular if the corresponding L* is a knot. In either case we can use Lemma [\ref=sigmaseries] to obtain that:

[formula]

where *  =  +  or -   and from this it follows that δ  =    ±  1 or 0.

This result implies that in any nullification sequence of K, the smoothing of a crossing can only change the signature by at most one. Since the signature of the trivial link is zero and n(K) is the minimum number of smoothing moves needed to change K to a trivial link, it follows that |σ(K)|  ≤  n(K).

Let K be any knot then |σ(K)|  ≤  n(K)  ≤  2u(K). In particular if |σ(K)|  =  2u(K), then |σ(K)| = n(K) = 2u(K).

Note that the above Corollary is quite powerful if one wants to determine the actual general nullification number for small knots in the knot table. In [\cite=EMS] the general nullification number of all but two knots of up to 9 crossings is determined. The following corollary is an immediate consequence of Theorem [\ref=signature] and the fact that all knots have even signatures [\cite=M].

If K is a knot and n(K) = 1, then σ(K) = 0.

In [\cite=Hon] the signature of an oriented alternating link K is related to the writhe via the concept of nullification writhe. Let D be a reduced alternating diagram of K and in this diagram we have a nullification sequence of crossings c1, c2, ... , ck, where k = nD = nd(K), then the nullification writhe introduced in [\cite=C] is defined as the sum of the signs of the crossings c1, c2, ... , ck and is denoted by Wr(nD). We have:

[\cite=Hon] For an alternating oriented link σ(K) + Wr(nD) = 0.

The example of the 4-plat given in Figures [\ref=nullification4Plat] and [\ref=4platexample] (with k = 3) represents the knot 1022. This knot has σ(1022) = 0 (In fact we can see that a nullification sequence for the diagram in Figure [\ref=4platexample] has a nullification sequence of three positive and three negative crossings.) On the other hand we see that the inequality in Theorem [\ref=signature] is strict since n(1022) = 1. Note that the signature of a 4-plat can be computed by the following explicit formula.

[\cite=Sto3] Let K be a 4-plat knot then

[formula]

where the vector (a1,a2,...,a2g) is a continued fraction expansion of K using only even integers. (Such a continued fraction expansion is called an even continued fraction expansion.)

In fact, the length of the even continued fraction expansion is 2g where g is the genus of K [\cite=Crom]. We also have the following two corollaries:

If D is a reduced alternating diagram of an alternating oriented link K such that all crossings in a nullification sequence of D have the same sign, i.e., |Wr(nD)| = nD, then nd(K) = n(K).

We have |σ(K)| = |Wr(nD)| = nD = nd(K)  ≥  n(K)  ≥  |σ(K)|. Thus the equality holds.

For any even positive integer k the number of knots K with Cr(K) crossings and |n(K)|  ≥  k grows exponentially with [formula].

Let us assume for simplicity that m = Cr(K) is odd and consider the 4-plats K with a vector form (a1,a2,...,a2g) such that ai is even and aiai + 1 < 0 for all i. Then σ(K) = 2g. The crossing number Cr(K) is given by [\cite=Crom]

[formula]

If m = Cr(K) is sufficiently large then we can generate such a vector by partitioning the positive integer m + 2g - 1 into 2g even integers bi where bi  ≥  2. Here we set ai = ( - 1)i + 1  ·  bi. This is equivalent to partitioning the integer m - 2g - 1 into 2g even integers ci where ci  ≥  0 which in turn is equivalent to the number of partitions of the integer (m - 1) / 2 - g into 2g integers di where di  ≥  0. A standard result in number theory about the number of partitions then implies the result.

Nullification Number One Links

In this section we explore the special family of links whose general nullification number is one. The first question is about the number of such links. In the following we will give a partial answer to this question. Let [formula] be the standard vector form of a rational link K corresponding to the rational number [formula]. Consider the rational link [formula] defined by the vector [formula], where [formula]. Let [formula] be the fraction for [formula], then we can get [formula] by using a method from [\cite=Sieb]. Furthermore, when K is a knot, [formula] is also a knot and has general nullification number 1.

Two fractions [formula] and [formula] represent the same knot iff [formula] or [formula]. If ε1  =  ε2 then this yields [formula] or [formula]. So [formula] or [formula]. This implies that different fractions [formula] result in different 4-plats [formula] (up to mirror images).

Thus we have shown that for each rational knot K, there exists a rational knot [formula] (unique up to mirror image) with nullification number one. Furthermore, [formula]. Since the number of rational knots grows exponentially, we have shown the following theorem.

The number of knots K with n(K) = 1 and Cr(K)  ≤  n grows exponentially in terms of n.

We would like to point out that the rational knots considered above do not contain all nullification number one rational knots. We give two additional example of 4-plat knot families with nullification number one. In the two examples we do not follow the usual vector notation for rational knots such as in [\cite=BZ]. Instead we adopt the sign assignment convention as shown in Figure [\ref=convention] for the crossings that are in the boxes in Figures [\ref=family1] and [\ref=family2]. Here the crossings have two ends marked as on the bottom and the other two ends as on the top and therefore the crossings in Figure [\ref=convention] can not be rotated by 90 degrees.

Note that the actual sign convention as shown in in Figure [\ref=convention] does not matter as long as the the crossings in the two boxes with the same label have opposite handedness. These three families of rational knots have one interesting property in common, namely that they are all ribbon knots (to be defined next). In fact it was conjectured in [\cite=Cass] that these were the only rational ribbon knots. This conjecture was recently proven in [\cite=Lisca].

Let K be a link in S3, and b:I  ×  I  →  S3 be an imbedding such that [formula]. Let [formula]. If Kb is a link with an orientation compatible with K then Kb is called a banding of K, or is obtained from K by band surgery (along b). It turns out that nullification and banding are equivalent operations. See Figure [\ref=nullBandEquiv].

A knot K is a ribbon knot if it is a knot obtained from a trivial (m + 1)-component link by band surgery along m bands for some m. The minimum of such number m is called the ribbon-fusion number of K and is denoted by rf(K). (This concept was introduced by Kanenobu [\cite=kanBand].) If a knot can be nullified in one step then it yields the trivial 2-component link. So a knot has nullification number one if and only if it is a 1-fusion ribbon knot. Using this, one can easily find all nullification number one knots. This can be done by quickly referencing all ribbon presentations of ribbon knots with 10 or fewer crossings (such as in [\cite=Kawa]). All such diagrams either explicitly have the necessary crossing, or will have one after applying a Reidemeister move of type II as shown in Figure [\ref=ribbonNull]. Furthermore, the fact that 1-fusion ribbon knots have nullification number one, together with the following theorem due to Tanaka [\cite=tanBrid], implies that the nullification number and the bridge number of a knot are unrelated in general.

[\cite=tanBrid] For any pair (p,q) of positive integers with 1  ≤  p  ≤  q, there exists a family of infinitely many composite ribbon knots Ki such that 2(p + q) + 1  ≤  b(Ki)  ≤  2(p + q + 1) and rf(Ki) = p, where b(Ki) denotes the bridge number of the knot Ki.

In particular if we let (p,q) = (1,q) then we get an infinite family of 1-fusion ribbon knots (nullification number one knots) with arbitrarily large bridge number.

For higher fusion numbers it is not a priori clear whether nullification number is equal to the fusion number. Fusion number m relies on the separation of a ribbon knot into (m + 1) trivial components, but nullification does not have such a restriction. So for a given ribbon knot K, it is only obvious that n(K)  ≤  rf(K).

Let us end our paper with a few open questions.

1. For a knot or link L, how big the difference between nr(L) and nd(L) can be? Can we find a class of knots/links such that nd(L) - nr(L) is unbounded over all L from this family?

2. If [formula] is a diagram obtained from an alternating (reduced) diagram D by one crossing change (so [formula] is no longer alternating and it may even be the trivial knot/link), how much smaller is [formula] compared to nD? For alternating knots with unknotting number one, [formula] is simply zero hence this difference can be as large as one wants. However, is there a way to relate this problem with the unknotting numbers in general?

3. By nullifying one crossing in a diagram D (not necessarily minimum) of a knot/link K, we obtain a new knot/link. How many different knots/links can be obtained this way? In particular, is this number bounded above by Cr(K)?
