Introduction

A graph G is perfect if for every induced subgraph H of G, the clique number of H (denoted by ω(H)) is equal to the chromatic number of H. We define a perfect coloring of a graph G as a proper coloring of G such that every connected induced subgraph H of G uses exactly ω(H) many colors. A graph is said to be perfectly colorable if it admits a perfect coloring. A necessary and sufficient condition for a graph to be perfectly colorable is derived below.

Perfectly Colorable Graphs

All graphs mentioned here are simple. We follow [\cite=west2001introduction] for definitions. A graph is paw-free if it does not contain a paw (see Figure [\ref=fig:paw]) as an induced subgraph. We use the following characterization of perfect paw-free graphs to prove our result.

G is a perfect paw-free graph if and only if each component of G is bipartite or complete multipartite.

A graph is perfectly colorable if and only if it is perfect paw-free.

It is clear that unless a graph is perfect, it is not perfectly colorable. Further, if a graph has a paw as an induced subgraph then it is not perfectly colorable. This is because in any proper coloring of a paw (see Figure [\ref=fig:paw]), either the induced path Pacd or Pbcd uses 3 colors. But the clique number is 2 for both the paths.

Conversely, let G be perfect paw-free. Then by Theorem [\ref=th:pawfree], each component of G is either bipartite or complete multipartite. In both these cases any minimal proper colouring is perfect and hence the result follows.

Since recognition and coloring of bipartite and complete multipartite graphs can be done in linear time, perfectly colorable graphs can be recognized and colored in linear time.
