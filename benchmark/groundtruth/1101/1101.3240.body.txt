Introduction

The present acceleration of the universe expansion has been well established through numerous and complementary cosmological observations [\cite=Riess]. A component which is responsible for this accelerated expansion usually dubbed "dark energy" (DE). However, the nature of DE is still unknown, and people have proposed some candidates to describe it (for review see [\cite=Padmanabhan] [\cite=Copeland] and references therein).

One of the important questions in cosmology concerns the thermodynamical behavior of the accelerated expanding universe driven by DE. It was shown that the Einstein equation can be derived from the first law of thermodynamics by assuming the proportionality of entropy and the horizon area [\cite=Hawking] [\cite=Bardeen] [\cite=Jacobson]. In the cosmological context, attempts to disclose the connection between Einstein gravity and thermodynamics were carried out. It was shown that the differential form of the Friedmann equation in the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe can be written in the form of the first law of thermodynamics on the apparent horizon [\cite=Cai05]. Further studies on the equivalence between the first law of thermodynamics and Friedmann equation has been investigated in various gravity theories like Gauss-Bonnet, Lovelock and braneworld scenarios [\cite=Cai05] [\cite=Akbar] [\cite=Sheykhi2].

Besides examining the validity of the thermodynamical interpretation of gravity by expressing the gravitational field equations into the first law of thermodynamics in different spacetimes, it is also of great interest to investigate the validity of the generalized second law (GSL) of thermodynamics in the accelerating universe driven by DE. The GSL of thermodynamics is as important as the first law, governing the development of the nature [\cite=Davies] [\cite=Gong] [\cite=Izquierdo2] [\cite=Izquierdo] [\cite=Zhau] [\cite=Sheykhi3] [\cite=Jamil] [\cite=Wang2] [\cite=Karami2] [\cite=Karami3].

Here our aim is to investigate the validity of the GSL of gravitational thermodynamics for the interacting DE model with DM in a non-flat FRW universe enclosed by the dynamical apparent horizon and the cosmological event horizon. Note that in the literature, people usually have studied the validity of the GSL for a specific model of DE with special kind of interaction term. But we would like to extend it to any DE model with general interaction term. This paper is organized as follows. In section [\ref=II], we study the DE model in a non-flat FRW universe which is in interaction with the DM. In section [\ref=III], we investigate the validity of the GSL of gravitational thermodynamics for the universe enclosed by the apparent horizon and the event horizon which is in thermal equilibrium with the Hawking radiation of the horizon. Also we give an example for the case of the cosmological event horizon. In section [\ref=IV] we investigate the effect of interaction term between DE and DM on the GSL. Section [\ref=V] is devoted to conclusions.

Interacting DE and DM in FRW cosmology

The first Friedmann equation in FRW cosmology takes the form

[formula]

where we take G = 1 and k = 0,1, - 1 represent a flat, closed and open FRW universe, respectively. Also ρΛ and ρm are the energy density of DE and DM, respectively.

From ([\ref=eqfr]), we can write

[formula]

where we have used the following definitions

[formula]

Since we consider the interaction between DE and DM, ρΛ and ρm do not conserve separately. Hence the energy conservation equations for DE and DM are

[formula]

[formula]

where Q stands for the interaction term. For Q > 0, there is an energy transfer from the DE to DM. The choice of the interaction between both components was to get a scaling solution to the coincidence problem such that the universe approaches a stationary stage in which the ratio of DE and DM becomes a constant [\cite=Huang]. The dynamics of interacting DE models with different Q-classes have been studied in ample detail by [\cite=Amendola]. Here we continue our study without considering a specific form for the interaction term.

Taking the time derivative in both sides of Eq. ([\ref=eqfr]), and using Eqs. ([\ref=eq10]), ([\ref=eqomega]), ([\ref=eqpol]) and ([\ref=eqCDM]), one can get the equation of state (EoS) parameter of DE as

[formula]

For the DE dominated universe, i.e. ΩΛ  →  1, the above equation yields

[formula]

which shows that for the phantom, ωΛ <  - 1, and quintessence, ωΛ >  - 1, dominated universe, we need to have [formula] and [formula], respectively. Note that for the de Sitter universe, i.e. [formula], we have ωΛ =  - 1 which behaves like the cosmological constant.

The deceleration parameter is given by

[formula]

Replacing the term [formula] from ([\ref=wlambda]) into ([\ref=q1]) yields

[formula]

GSL with corrected entropy-area relation

Here, we study the validity of the GSL of gravitational thermodynamics. According to the GSL, entropy of matter and fluids inside the horizon plus the entropy of the horizon do not decrease with time [\cite=Wang2]. Here like [\cite=Sheykhi3], we assume that the temperature of both dark components are equal, due to their mutual interaction. Note that Lima and Alcaniz [\cite=Lima] using a very naive estimate obtained the present value of the DE temperature as T0DE  ~  10- 6  ~  K. Also Zhou et al. [\cite=Zhou] estimated the DM temperature as T0DM  ~  10- 7  ~  K for the present time. Since the temperature of the DE at the present time differs from that of the DM, the systems must interact for some length of time before they can attain thermal equilibrium. Although in this case the local equilibrium hypothesis may no longer hold [\cite=Zhou] [\cite=Das], Karami and Ghaffari [\cite=Karami1] showed that the contribution of the heat flow between the DE and the DM in the GSL in non-equilibrium thermodynamics is very small, O(10- 7). Therefore the equilibrium thermodynamics is still preserved. We also limit ourselves to the assumption that the thermal system including the DE and DM bounded by the horizon remain in equilibrium so that the temperature of the system must be uniform and the same as the temperature of its boundary. This requires that the temperature T of the both DE and DM inside the horizon should be in equilibrium with the Hawking temperature Th associated with the horizon, so we have T  =  Th. This expression holds in the local equilibrium hypothesis. If the temperature of the system differs much from that of the horizon, there will be spontaneous heat flow between the horizon and the fluid and the local equilibrium hypothesis will no longer hold [\cite=Zhou] [\cite=Das] [\cite=Karami1]. This is also at variance with the FRW geometry. In general, when we consider the thermal equilibrium state of the universe, the temperature of the universe is associated with the horizon.

The entropy of the universe including the DE and DM inside the horizon can be related to its energy and pressure in the horizon by Gibb's equation [\cite=Izquierdo]

[formula]

where V = 4πR3h / 3 is the volume containing the DE and DM with the radius of the horizon Rh and T = Th = 1 / (2πRh) is the Hawking temperature of the horizon. Also

[formula]

[formula]

Taking the derivative in both sides of ([\ref=eqSLT1]) with respect to cosmic time t, and using Eqs. ([\ref=eqfr]), ([\ref=eq10]), ([\ref=eqomega]), ([\ref=eqpol]), ([\ref=eqCDM]), ([\ref=eqEde]) and ([\ref=eqEcdm]), we obtain the evolution of the entropy in the universe containing the DE and DM as

[formula]

Also in addition to the entropy in the universe, there is a geometric entropy on the horizon Sh  =  πR2h [\cite=Izquierdo]. The evolution of this horizon entropy is obtained as

[formula]

Finally, the GSL due to different contributions of the DE, DM and horizon is obtained as

[formula]

where Stot = S + Sh is the total entropy. Note that in Stot we ignored the contribution of baryonic matter (BM) (Ω0BM  ~  0.04) in comparison with the DM and DE (Ω0DM  +  Ω0DE  ~  0.96). Because according to the recent measurements of the supermassive black hole mass function, the present entropy of BM S0BM = (2.7  ±  2.1)  ×  1080 is five to seven orders of magnitude smaller than the DM S0DM = 6  ×  1086  ±  1 [\cite=Egan].

In the next sections, we investigate the validity of the GSL given by Eq. ([\ref=Stot2]) for the dynamical apparent and cosmological event horizons.

The dynamical apparent horizon

The dynamical apparent horizon in the FRW universe is given by [\cite=Cai09]

[formula]

For k  =  0, the apparent horizon is same as the Hubble horizon.

Recently Cai et al. [\cite=Cai09] proofed that the apparent horizon of the FRW universe with any spatial curvature has indeed an associated Hawking temperature TA  =  1 / 2πRA. Cai et al. [\cite=Cai09] also showed that the Hawking temperature can be measured by an observer with the Kodoma vector inside the apparent horizon.

If we take the derivative in both sides of ([\ref=ah]) with respect to cosmic time t, then we obtain

[formula]

Using Eqs. ([\ref=ah]) and ([\ref=ahdot]) one can get

[formula]

Substituting Eqs. ([\ref=ah]), ([\ref=ahdot]) and ([\ref=ahahdot]) in ([\ref=S2]) and ([\ref=Sh]) reduce to

[formula]

[formula]

Equation ([\ref=Sah]) shows that for [formula], the contribution of entropy of the universe inside the dynamical apparent horizon in the GSL is negative, i.e. [formula]. For the late-time or the DE dominated universe where ΩΛ  →  1 and RA = H- 1, the entropy of the universe will be a non-increasing function of time in the quintessence regime with - 1 < ωΛ <  - 1 / 3.

Equation ([\ref=SAah]) clears that for [formula], the contribution of the dynamical apparent horizon in the GSL is positive, i.e. [formula]. For the DE dominated universe, the entropy of the dynamical apparent horizon will be an increasing function of time in the quintessence regime with ωΛ >  - 1.

Finally, using Eqs. ([\ref=Sah]) and ([\ref=SAah]), the GSL due to different contributions of the DE, DM and apparent horizon can be obtained as

[formula]

Equation ([\ref=Stotah]) presents that the GSL for the universe containing the interacting DE with DM enclosed by the dynamical apparent horizon is always satisfied throughout the history of the universe for any spatial curvature and it is independent of the EoS parameter of the interacting DE model.

The cosmological event horizon

For the cosmological event horizon defined as

[formula]

one can obtain

[formula]

For a de Sitter space-time where H is a constant, Eqs. ([\ref=eh]) and ([\ref=ehdot]) show that the cosmological event horizon radius is H- 1 and [formula]. Therefore, in a spatially flat de Sitter universe, the event horizon and the apparent horizon, given by Eq. ([\ref=ah]), of the universe coincide with each other and there is only one cosmological horizon [\cite=Gong]. For the de Sitter universe, from Eq. ([\ref=wlambda]) we have ωΛ =  - 1 / ΩΛ hence Eq. ([\ref=Stot2]) shows that [formula], which corresponds to a reversible adiabatic expansion.

Substituting Eq. ([\ref=ehdot]) into ([\ref=S2]) yields the entropy of the universe inside the cosmological event horizon as

[formula]

Equation ([\ref=Seh]) clears that for [formula], the contribution of the cosmological event horizon in the GSL is positive, i.e. [formula]. For the late-time universe, the entropy of the universe will be an increasing function of time in the phantom regime with ωΛ <  - 1.

Following [\cite=Sadjadi], for the quintessence and phantom universe, [formula] and [formula], respectively. Therefore, form Eq. ([\ref=Sh]) one can conclude that for the quintessence universe [formula] and for the phantom universe [formula].

Substituting Eq. ([\ref=ehdot]) into ([\ref=Stot2]) yields

[formula]

which shows that the GSL is satisfied, i.e. [formula], when

[formula]

The above constraint on the EoS parameter of the interacting DE model presents that for the late-time universe in the quintessence and phantom regime, we have [formula] and [formula], respectively.

Substituting Eq. ([\ref=ehdot]) into ([\ref=Stoteh2]) yields ωΛ  ≤  f(HRE) where

[formula]

In Fig. [\ref=f], the solid line shows f(HRE) versus HRE for the DE dominated universe where ΩΛ  →  1 and the dotted line presents f(HRE) =  - 1 / 3. Note that for a universe enclosed by the event horizon, we have always ωΛ <  - 1 / 3. Figure [\ref=f] clears that for f(HRE) < ωΛ <  - 1 / 3 the GSL is not satisfied on the cosmological event horizon and it remains valid only for ωΛ  ≤  f(HRE).

Therefore, for the non-flat FRW universe containing the interacting DE with DM enclosed by the cosmological event horizon, the GSL is satisfied for the special range of the EoS parameter of the DE model. Contrary to the case of the apparent horizon, the validity of the GSL for the cosmological event horizon depends on the EoS parameter of the interacting DE model.

A pole-like type phantom universe enclosed by the event horizon

Here we give an example to study the GSL in the case of the cosmological event horizon. Following [\cite=Sadjadi], we consider a phantom DE model of the universe describing by a pole-like type scale factor as

[formula]

then one can get

[formula]

also

[formula]

The cosmological event horizon can be obtained as

[formula]

also

[formula]

Equations ([\ref=hdot]) and ([\ref=redotexa]) confirm that the model ([\ref=aexa]) is correspondence to a phantom dominated universe.

The EoS and deceleration parameters of the model ([\ref=aexa]) are obtained by the help of Eqs. ([\ref=wlambda]) and ([\ref=q1]), respectively, as

[formula]

[formula]

Equation ([\ref=wlambdaexa]) shows that for the late-time universe, we have [formula] which is the EoS parameter of phantom DE.

From Eqs. ([\ref=Sh]), ([\ref=Seh]), ([\ref=H]), ([\ref=reexa]), ([\ref=redotexa]) and ([\ref=wlambdaexa]), the entropy of the event horizon and the entropy of the universe inside the event horizon can be obtained as

[formula]

[formula]

Equation ([\ref=Seexa]) shows that the entropy of the event horizon for the model ([\ref=aexa]) has a negative contribution in the GSL throughout the history of the universe. Equation ([\ref=Sexa]) clears that the entropy of the universe has a positive contribution in the GSL only when Ωk  ≤  1 / n. Finally for the model ([\ref=aexa]), the GSL yields

[formula]

which clears that for the positive spatial curvature, compatible with the present observations [\cite=Bennett], the GSL breaks down.

The effect of interaction term between DE and DM on the GSL

In our previous analysis, the interaction term between DE and DM is not appeared explicitly in the GSL. To see how the DE-DM interaction influences the GSL, we need to incorporate a specific form of the DE model in our analysis. To do this we consider the holographic DE (HDE) model which is motivated from the holographic principle [\cite=Hooft]. Following [\cite=Huang], the HDE density in a closed universe is given by

[formula]

where c is a positive constant and MP is the reduced Planck Mass M- 2P = 8π. Recent observational data, which have been used to constrain the HDE model, show that for the non-flat universe c = 0.815+ 0.179- 0.139 [\cite=Li5]. Also L is the IR cut-off defined as

[formula]

where [formula]. Note that RE is the radial size of the event horizon measured in the r direction and L is the radius of the event horizon measured on the sphere of the horizon [\cite=Huang]. For the flat universe L = RE. For a specific form of the interaction term between DE and DM as Q = 3b2H(ρΛ  +  ρm) with b2 the coupling constant [\cite=Kim06], the EoS parameter for the interacting HDE with DM in a non-flat FRW universe is obtained as [\cite=Lin]

[formula]

where [formula]. Therefore the coupling constant b2 due to interaction is appeared explicitly in the EoS parameter of the HDE. For the dynamical apparent horizon, Eq. ([\ref=Stotah]) shows that the GSL is always satisfied throughout the history of the universere regardless of the specific form of DE model and interaction term Q. But for the cosmological event horizon, the story is different. The GSL for the interacting HDE with DM in a non-flat universe enclosed by the event horizon measured from the sphere of the horizon L is obtained from Eq. ([\ref=Stot2]) as

[formula]

where the necessary expressions for L and [formula] are given by Eqs. (15) and (16) in [\cite=Huang], respectively, as

[formula]

[formula]

Substituting Eqs. ([\ref=omegaeffh]), ([\ref=L]) and ([\ref=Ldot]) in ([\ref=Stot2L]) yields

[formula]

which is same as the result given by Eq. (1.6) in [\cite=Karami2]. Equation ([\ref=dStot3L]) shows that the coupling constant b2 of the interaction term Q does affect the GSL on the radius of the event horizon L. For instance, for cos y = 0.99, ΩΛ = 0.73, Ωk = 0.01 and c = 1 given by [\cite=Setare] for the present time, we get

[formula]

which shows that only for b2  ≥  0.264 then [formula] and the GSL is satisfied.

Conclusions

Here the GSL of gravitational thermodynamics for the interacting DE with DM in a non-flat FRW universe is investigated. Some experimental data have implied that our universe is not a perfectly flat universe and it possess a small positive curvature [\cite=Bennett]. Although it is believed that our universe is flat, a contribution to the Friedmann equation from spatial curvature is still possible if the number of e-foldings is not very large [\cite=Huang]. The boundary of the universe is assumed to be enveloped by the dynamical apparent horizon and the cosmological event horizon. We assumed that the universe to be in thermal equilibrium with the Hawking temperature on the horizon. We found that for the dynamical apparent horizon, the GSL is respected throughout the history of the universe for any spatial curvature and it is independent of the EoS parameter of the interacting DE model. But for the cosmological event horizon, the GSL is satisfied for the special range of the EoS parameter of the model.

The above results show that the dynamical apparent horizon in comparison with the cosmological event horizon, is a good boundary for studying cosmology, since on the apparent horizon there is the well known correspondence between the first law of thermodynamics and the Einstein equation [\cite=Gong5]. In the other words, the Friedmann equations describe local properties of spacetimes and the apparent horizon is determined locally, while the cosmological event horizon, Eq. ([\ref=eh]), is determined by global properties of spacetimes [\cite=Cai05]. Besides in the dynamic spacetime, the horizon thermodynamics is not as simple as that of the static spacetime. The event horizon and apparent horizon are in general different surfaces. The definition of thermodynamical quantities on the cosmological event horizon in the nonstatic universe are probably ill-defined [\cite=Wang2].
