We derive two new retarded solutions in the teleparallel theory equivalent to general relativity (TEGR). One of these solutions gives a divergent energy. Therefore, we used the regularized expression of the gravitational energy-momentum tensor, which is a coordinate dependent. A detailed analysis of the loss of the mass of Bondi space-time is carried out using the flux of the gravitational energy-momentum.

The linearized theory has been developed extensively, however, it seems doubtful if its results can be fully trusted [\cite=SN]. The non-linearity of the gravitational field is the most characteristic properties and some of the crucial properties of the field show themselves only through the non-linear terms. Additionally, it is never clear whether solutions derived from the linearization corresponds to exact solutions [\cite=SN]. In spite that we have a good deal about exact plane and cylindrical wave solutions, it is doughtily whether such solutions display the characteristics of physically significant waves [\cite=BBM]. Einstein's General relativity (GR) theory is a complete one however, it may not give sensible solutions for situations too far removed from what is physically reasonable. The most simplest field due to a finite source which can be obtained from GR is the spherically symmetric solution, however, Birkhoff's theorem shows that such solution must be static. For this reason, one cannot be truly speak about spherically symmetric waves and thus any description of radiation from a finite system must necessary involve three coordinate significantly. This makes the mathematical calculations more complicated and thus we have to make use of methods of approximation.

Two well established formulas of gravitational energy are the ADM (Arnowitt-Deser-Misner) energy that corresponds to the total energy [\cite=ADM] and the Bondi energy [\cite=BBM] which describes the mass of radiating systems in asymptotic flat space-times. The loss of energy of the total mass of a source that radiates gravitational waves is main feature of the Bondi energy [\cite=BBM], i.e.,

[formula]

where c0 is the news function. Eq. (1) shows that Bondi energy is related to the loss of the total mass of a source that radiates gravitational waves. The loss of the total mass is given in terms of the minus news function squared which means that the mass of the source can decrease.

Teleparallel theories are interesting for several reasons: first of all, general relativity (GR) can be viewed as a particular theory of teleparallelism and, thus, teleparallelism could be considered at the very least as a different point of view that can lead to the same results [\cite=TM]. Second, in this framework, one can define an energy-momentum tensor for the gravitational field that is a true tensor under all general coordinate transformations. This is the reason why teleparallelism was reconsidered by Mø ller when he was studying the problem of defining an energy-momentum tensor for the gravitational field [\cite=M2]. The idea was taken over by Pellegrini and Plebaski that constructed the general Lagrangian for these theories [\cite=PP]. The third reason why these theories are interesting is that they can be seen as gauge theories of the translation group (not the full Poincar�e group) and, thus, they give an alternative interpretation of GR [\cite=Hw] [\cite=NHC] [\cite=AGP] [\cite=HS]. Therefore, we consider the tetrad theory of gravitation in this work.

It is the aim of the present work to study the variation of the gravitational energy and the corresponding total flux of energy at spacelike infinity within the framework of TEGR. To do so we derive the solution given by Bondi [\cite=BBM] in the framework of TEGR and then compute the total mass using the energy-momentum tensor. Also we compute the loss of mass using the flux of the gravitational energy-momentum tensor [\cite=MDTC]. In § 2, we briefly review the TEGR theory for gravitational field and its derivation of the field equations. A summary of the derivation of energy and total fluxes of the gravitational energy-momentum are also given in § 2. In § 3, we study the most general tetrad field which contains 16 unknown functions. Two new solutions are also given in § 3. Then, we calculate the total mass of these solutions using the regularized expression in § 4. Using the flux of the gravitational energy-momentum we also calculate the loss of mass in § 4. Final section is devoted for the main results.

In a space-time with absolute parallelism the parallel vector fields eaμ define the nonsymmetric affine connection

[formula]

where eaμ, ν  =  ∂νeaμ. The curvature tensor defined by Γλμν, given by Eq. (2), is identically vanishing. The metric tensor gμν is defined by

[formula]

with ηab = ( - 1, + 1, + 1, + 1) is the metric of Minkowski space-time.

The Lagrangian density for the gravitational field in the TEGR, in the presence of matter fields, is given by [\cite=MDTC]

[formula]

where e = det(eaμ). The tensor Σabc is defined by

[formula]

Tabc and Ta are the torsion tensor and the basic vector field defined by

[formula]

The quadratic combination ΣabcTabc is proportional to the scalar curvature R(e), except for a total divergence term [\cite=MDTC]. Lm represents the Lagrangian density for matter fields.

The gravitational field equations described by G are the following

[formula]

where

[formula]

It is possible to prove by explicit calculations that the left hand side of the symmetric field equations (7) is exactly given by [\cite=MDTC]

[formula]

Multiplication of Eq. (7) by the appropriate inverse tetrad fields yields it to have the form [\cite=MDTC] [\cite=MVR]

[formula]

By restricting the space-time index λ to assume only spatial values then Eq. (8) takes the form [\cite=MDTC]

[formula]

Note that the last two indices of Σabc and Tabc are anti-symmetric. Taking the divergence of Eq. (9) with respect to j yields

[formula]

The Hamiltonian formulation of TEGR is obtained by establishing the phase space variables. The Lagrangian density does not contain the time derivative of the tetrad component ea0. Therefore, this quantity will arise as a Lagrange multiplier [\cite=Dp]. The momentum canonically conjugated to eai is given by [formula]. The Hamiltonian formulation is obtained by rewriting the Lagrangian density in the form [formula], in terms of eai,Πai and the Lagrange multipliers. The Legendre transformation can be successfully carried out and the final form of the Hamiltonian density has the form [\cite=MR]

[formula]

plus a surface term. Here αik and βk are Lagrange multipliers that are identified as

[formula]

where Ca, Γik and Γk are first class constraints.

The constraint Ca is written as Ca =  - ∂iΠai + ha, where ha is an intricate expression of the field variables. The integral form of the constraint equation Ca = 0 motivates the definition of the gravitational energy-momentum Pa four-vector [\cite=MDTC]

[formula]

where V is an arbitrary volume of the three-dimensional space. In the configuration space we have

[formula]

By integrating Eq. (10) on a volume V of the three-dimensional space we get [\cite=MDTC]

[formula]

where

[formula]

is the a component of the gravitational energy-momentum flux and

[formula]

is the a component of the matter energy-momentum flux. S represent the spatial boundary of the volume V. Therefore the loss of the gravitational energy P(0) = E is governed by the equation

[formula]

Maluf and Faria have shown that φg0 played a major role to the Bondi's radiating space-time, since it yields the well known expression for the gravitational energy loss, while φm0 is related to the Vaidya's space-time [\cite=MF].

In this section we are going to use the most general tetrad field which contains 16 unknown functions. Let us write it in the coordinate (t, r, θ, φ) by

[formula]

where Ai, Bi, Fi, Hi, [formula] are unknown functions of r, θ, φ and t. Applying Eq. (19) to the field equations (7) we obtained a very lengthy and tedious system of partial differential equations. We are going to write a special solutions to these system. First solution: The 16 unknown functions in this solution have the form

[formula]

The functions β, γ, V and U appear in Eq. (20) have the following asymptotic behavior up to [formula]

[formula]

where the time t is defined as t = u + r which is the retarded time. The quantities l(u,θ) and l1(u,θ) are defined as

[formula]

with M(u,θ), c(u,θ) and d(u,θ) are the mass aspect, the news function and the dipole aspect respectively. Solution given by Eq. (20) with Eqs. (21) and (22) satisfies the field equations (7) up to [formula]. The metric associated with solution given by Eq. (20) has the form

[formula]

which is the Bondi space-time [\cite=MDTC]. Second solution: The 16 unknown functions in this case have the form

[formula]

The functions β, γ, V,  U,  W and δ appear in Eq. (24) have the following asymptotic behavior up to [formula]

[formula]

The quantities l(u,θ) and l1(u,θ) are defined in Eq. (22) and l2(u,θ) has the form

[formula]

The metric associated with solution given by Eq. (24) has the form

[formula]

which is the Bondi space-time [\cite=Zh]. Solutions (20) and (24) satisfy the field equations (7) up to [formula].

Calculate the energy associated with solution (20) by calculating the torsion tensor and basic vector, we get finally up to [formula]

[formula]

which depends on the radial coordinate. Therefore, in this case we are going to use the regularized expression for the gravitational energy-momentum [\cite=MDTC].

For a space-time in which the physical quantities, i.e., M(u,θ) etc. equal to zero, it is usual to consider a set of tetrad fields such that the torsion Tλμν = 0 in any coordinate system. However, in general an arbitrary set of tetrad fields do not satisfy Tλμν = 0. It might be argued, therefore, that the expression for the gravitational energy-momentum (13) is restricted to particular class of tetrad fields, namely, to the class of frames such that Tλμν = 0. If Eaμ represents the space-time of the tetrad field in which the physical quantities equal zero [\cite=MVR]. To explain this, let us calculate the space-time in which the physical quantities equal zero for the tetrad field of Eq. (19) using (20) which is given by

[formula]

Expression (29) yields the following non-vanishing torsion components:

[formula]

We will denote Taμν(E) = ∂μEaν  -  ∂νEaμ and Πaj(E) as the expression of Πaj constructed out of the tetrad Eaμ. The regularized form of the gravitational energy-momentum Pa is defined by [\cite=MVR] [\cite=MR]

[formula]

The reference space-time is determined by tetrad fields Eaμ, obtained from eaμ by requiring the vanishing of the physical parameters like mass, angular-momentum, etc. Eq. (31) can have the form [\cite=MR] [\cite=MVR]

[formula]

where the surface S is established at spacelike infinity. Eq. (32) transforms as a vector under the global SO(3,1) group [\cite=MDTC].

Let us use Eq. (32) to calculate the gravitational energy of Eq. (20). We need to calculate the quantity

[formula]

Evaluate the above equation we find

[formula]

The expression of Π(0)1(E) is obtained by just making M(u,θ) = 0, in Eq. (33), it is given by

[formula]

Using Eqs. (33) and (34) in Eq. (32) we finally get the gravitational energy of the tetrad field of Eq. (19) using solution given by Eq. (20) in the form

[formula]

which is the Bondi energy [\cite=BBM].

The flux of the gravitational energy which is determined by putting a = (0) in Eq. (16) and by making j = 1, i.e., by integrating over a surface S of constant radius r, and requiring r    →      ∞  . Eq. (16) in such case has the form

[formula]

Applying Eq (36) to the tetrad field (19) using Eq. (20), we finally get

[formula]

which is the value of the loss of the gravitational mass of the Bondi space-time [\cite=BBM]. In that case Eq. (1) is satisfied for solution given by Eq. (20).

Using the regularized form of the energy given by Eq. (32) to calculate the gravitational energy of Eq (24), we finally get

[formula]

The expression of Π(0)1(E) is obtained by just making M(u,θ) = 0, in Eq. (38), it is given by

[formula]

Thus the gravitational energy of Eq. (24) is given by

[formula]

which is the Bondi energy [\cite=BBM].

Repeat the same calculations done for the first solution we finally, get the flux of the gravitational energy of the second solution in the form

[formula]

which is the value of the loss of mass of the Bondi space-time [\cite=BBM] [\cite=Zh]. The flux given by Eq. (41) will coincide with that of Eq. (37) when the function d(u,θ) = 0 which means that the function δ appears in solution (24) must vanish.

The main results of the present paper are the following: [formula] We have obtained two new special solutions which satisfy the field equations (7). These solutions reproduce the Bondi space-time [\cite=BBM] [\cite=MDTC] [\cite=Zh]. [formula] We have calculated the energy associated with the first solution and found that it is depends on the radial coordinate. This is due to the fact if the physical quantities, i.e., M(u,θ) set equal zero we show that the components of the torsion tensor did not vanishing as it should be! Therefore, we have used the regularized expression to recalculate the energy associated with the two solutions. We have shown that the formula of energy associated with these solutions are coincide with that given by Bondi [\cite=BBM]. [formula] We have used the flux of the energy-momentum of gravitational and matter fields [\cite=MF]. The flux of matter field has no effect since the solutions are vacuum ones to the field equations. The non-vanishing value of the flux of the gravitational energy-momentum indicates the emission of the gravitational waves. [formula] Maluf and Faria [\cite=MF] have applied the flux of the gravitational energy-momentum to a tetrad which is different from that we have obtained here. Our results are in coincident with what obtained before [\cite=MF]. [formula] Zhang [\cite=Zh] have discussed within the Reimannian geometry the properties of the metric (27). Here we have discussed the gravitational radiation of this metric within the teleparallel geometry by using the flux of the gravitational energy-momentum. Also we have shown that our results are in coincident with that obtained before [\cite=Zh]. [formula] A further work that can be done for the solutions obtained in this work is to study their spatial momentum and angular-momentum. This will be our future work.

Here in this appendix we write the explicitly the calculations used in Eq. (28) and in Eq. (38). For Eq. (28), the non-vanishing components of torsion are

and the non-vanishing components of the basic vector are

[formula]

where

[formula]

For Eq. (38) the non-vanishing components of the torsion tensor are
