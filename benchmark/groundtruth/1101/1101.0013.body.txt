A Harnack inequality for fractional Laplace equations with lower order terms

Introduction

This note is devoted to a Harnack inequality of Laplace equations without imposing sign condition on the coefficient of zero order terms.

The fractional Laplacians ( - Δ)σ, 0 < σ < 1, which are the infinitesimal generators in stable Lévy stable processes, are given by the Fourier transform F as follows: for [formula], n  ≥  2,

[formula]

Caffarelli and Silvestre [\cite=CS2] introduced fractional extension [formula] of v(x,0) = u(x) satisfying

[formula]

where c- 1σ = 2- 1(4π)2σΓ(2 - 2σ). Then the factional Laplacians are realized by the Dirichlet-Neumann map of v

[formula]

Let [formula] be the ball centered at origin with radius r. Our main result is

Let [formula] be nonnegative in [formula] and [formula]. Suppose that u(x) satisfies

[formula]

where a(x),b(x)∈L∞(B1). Then

[formula]

where C > 0 depends only on [formula].

To prove it, we establish a Harnack inequality for the equivalent problem as follow.

Let [formula], [formula] and ∂'QR = BR  ×  {0}. Define

[formula]

Let U∈H(t1 - 2σ,Q1) be nonnegative solution [formula] of

[formula]

Suppose a,b∈L∞(B1). Then

[formula]

where C > 0 depends only on n,σ and [formula].

The main feature is that we do not assume the sign condition of a(x). Previously, in the case [formula], Bass and Levin [\cite=Bas02] establish the Harnack inequality for nonnegative functions of a class of symmetric stable processes that are harmonic with respect to these processes, see also [\cite=ChenSong98] by Chen and Song. The analytic method was given by Caffarelli and Silvestre [\cite=CS2], by employing the fractional extension of fractional harmonic functions.

We here establish the Harnack inequality as in Theorem [\ref=thm3.1] by the Moser iteration. The proof bases on the properties of the weighted Sobolev space developed by Fabes, Kenig and Serapioni [\cite=FKS] and the John-Nirenberg inequality in A2 weighted BMO space obtained by Muchenhoupt and Wheeden [\cite=MW].

If [formula], the result is due to Han and Li [\cite=HL]. After we complete our manuscript, we observe that Theorem [\ref=thm3.1], the Harnack inequality for [formula], has been shown recently by Cabre and Sire [\cite=CS10] through making even extension and using the result of Fabes, Kenig and Serapioni [\cite=FKS]. But our proof has independent interest.

On the other hand, since the fractional Laplacian is a nonlocal operator, the condition u  ≥  0 in [formula] cannot be relaxed to u  ≥  0 in B1. In fact, we need all information in the complement of B1. For example, see an counterexample of the case [formula] in [\cite=K] by Kassmann. By the Dirichlet-Neumann map, we transform ([\ref=1.1]) to the local problem in [formula], which grantees the identity ([\ref=eqn-csi]). The nonnegative assumption of u implies that its fractional extension v is nonnegative in the half space [formula]. Thus, v  ≥  0 in all of cubes QR,R > 0. Therefore, we can obtain the desired Harnack inequality by studying the local version ([\ref=eqn-ep]).

The paper is organized as follows. In Section [\ref=s2], we demonstrate some properties in the weighted Sobolev spaces. The proofs of Theorem [\ref=thm1], [\ref=thm3.1] are given in Section [\ref=s3].

Preliminaries

In this section, we shall present some important weighted inequalities.

Denote [formula], ∂'QR = BR  ×  {0} and [formula]. We use capital letters like X = (x,t),Y = (y,s) to represent points in [formula].

Let us recall the definition of A2 class.

Let ω(X) be a nonnegative measurable function in [formula]. We say ω being of the class A2 if there exists a constant Cω such that for any ball [formula]

[formula]

where |  ·  | is the Lebesgue measure.

Let [formula] and ω(X)∈A2. Then there exist constants C and δ > 0 depending only n and [formula] such that for any [formula]

[formula]

where [formula].

The proof of this Lemma is similar to that of Theorem 1.2 in [\cite=FKS]. The following inequality is the only thing we need to show.

[formula]

where ωn is the area of the sphere [formula].

Extend f to be zero outside QR. Let X∈QR, then ([\ref=2.2]) follows from

[formula]

Since [formula], [formula] makes sense. Let [formula], the south half sphere. For t > 0, note that

[formula]

We integrate the above over ξ ranging on the south half sphere. This gives

[formula]

Identity ([\ref=2.3]) follows from coordinate changing.

Next we quote the following weighted Poincaré inequality which can be found in [\cite=FKS].

Let f∈C1(QR), then any [formula], we have

[formula]

where [formula].

Finally, we prove the following trace embedding result.

Let [formula] and α∈( - 1,1). Then there exists a positive constant δ depending only on α such that

[formula]

for any ε > 0.

For any 1 < p <   ∞  , we have

[formula]

Next, we claim for 0 < α < 1 and any λ >  - 1

[formula]

In fact, by the Hölder inequality

[formula]

Multiplying the above by [formula] and integrating over QR, we obtain

[formula]

so ([\ref=2.6]) follows.

We are going to prove ([\ref=2.4]). Let [formula]. It follows from ([\ref=2.5]) and the Hölder inequality that

[formula]

where we used ([\ref=2.6]) for [formula] and λ =  - α >  - 1 in the last inequality. Therefore, we complete the proof.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm1]

In this section, we will prove the main results by making use of the Moser's iteration.

For p∈(0,  ∞  ) denote

[formula]

Let U(X)∈H(t1 - 2σ,Q1) be a weak solution of

[formula]

Then

[formula]

where U+  =   max {0,U}, and C > 0 depends only on [formula].

Let k,m > 0 be some constants. Set [formula] and

[formula]

Consider the test function

[formula]

for some β  ≥  0 and some nonnegative function [formula]. Clearly, [formula] in {U < 0} and {U  ≥  m}. A direct calculation yields

[formula]

Multiplying ([\ref=3.1]) by φ and integrating by parts, we have

[formula]

where we used the Cauchy inequality and the fact [formula]. Choosing [formula] if b is not identically zero. Otherwise choose an arbitrary k > 0 and eventually let k  →  0. Then we see that [formula]. Hence ([\ref=3.2]) gives

[formula]

Set [formula]. Then

[formula]

Therefore, we have

[formula]

or

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=prop2.3],

[formula]

for some δ > 1 depending on n,σ. It follows that

[formula]

By the Sobolev inequality, see Lemma [\ref=prop2.2], we obtain

[formula]

where [formula]. For any 0 < r < R  ≤  1, consider an [formula] with η = 1 in Qr and [formula]. Thus we have

[formula]

or, by the definition of W,

[formula]

Noting that [formula], we get

[formula]

provided the integral in the right hand side is bounded. By letting m  →    ∞  , we conclude that

[formula]

where C > 0 is a constant depending only [formula]. As in standard Moser iterating procedure, we then arrive at

[formula]

or

[formula]

Recalling the definition of k, we complete the proof.

The next lemma is so called weak Harnack inequality.

Let U(X)∈H(t1 - 2σ,Q1) be a nonnegative weak solution of

[formula]

Then for some p > 0 and any 0 < θ  <  τ < 1 we have

[formula]

where C > 0 depends only on [formula].

Set [formula], for some positive k to be determined and [formula]. Let Φ be any nonnegative function in H(t1 - 2σ,Q1) with compact support in [formula]. Multiplying both sides of first inequality of ([\ref=3.4]) by [formula] and integrating by parts, we obtain

[formula]

Note that [formula] and [formula]. Therefore, we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

Choose [formula] if b is not identical zero. Otherwise, choose an arbitrary k > 0 and eventually let it tend to zero. Note that [formula]. Therefore Proposition [\ref=lem3.1] implies that for any τ∈(θ,1) and any p > 0

[formula]

or,

[formula]

where C > 0 depends only on n,σ,p,θ,τ.

The next key point is to show that there exists some p0 > 0 such that

[formula]

where C > 0 depends only on n,σ,τ. We are going to show that for any τ < 1

[formula]

where [formula]. The idea is as usual. ([\ref=3.5]) will follows from John-Nirenberg type lemma (see [\cite=MW]) if [formula].

We first derive an equation for W. Multiplying both sides of first inequality of ([\ref=3.4]) by [formula] and integrating by parts, we obtain

[formula]

where

[formula]

Replace Φ by Φ2. It follows from the Cauchy inequality and the Sobolev inequality that

[formula]

where C > 0 depends only on n,σ. Then for any Q2r(Y)  ⊂  Q1, [formula], choose Φ with

[formula]

We have

[formula]

Hence the Poincaré inequality, Lemma [\ref=prop2.2], implies

[formula]

For other Y∈Q1, one can verify the above similarly. Therefore, we conclude that W∈BMO(t1 - 2σ,Q1).

The proof follows from Proposition 3.1 and 3.2.

Since u  ≥  0 in [formula] be a solution of ([\ref=1.1]), there exists a nonnegative function [formula] satisfying

[formula]

and U(x,0) = u(x). It follows from ([\ref=eqn-DNm]) that

[formula]

where we used u∈C2(B1). Hence Theorem [\ref=thm1] immediately follows from Theorem [\ref=thm3.1].

Let 0 < σ < 1 and [formula], n > 2σ. Suppose that [formula], [formula] satisfies

[formula]

Then for δ > 0, there exists C(n,σ,δ) > 0 such that

[formula]

By rescaling, we can prove it from Theorem [\ref=thm1]. See another proof in [\cite=CS10].
