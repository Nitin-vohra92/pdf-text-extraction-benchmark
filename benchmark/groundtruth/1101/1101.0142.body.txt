Asymptotic Improvements of Lower Boundsfor the Least Common Multiplesof Arithmetic Progressions

Introduction

The search for effective bounds on the least common multiples of arithmetic progressions began with the work of Hanson [\cite=Ha] and Nair [\cite=Na], who respectively found upper and lower bounds for [formula]. Decades later, Bateman, Kalb, and Stenger [\cite=BKS] and Farhi [\cite=BF1] respectively obtained asymptotics and nontrivial lower bounds for the least common multiples of general arithmetic progressions. The bounds of Farhi [\cite=BF1] were then successively improved by Hong and Feng [\cite=8], Hong and Yang [\cite=HY], Hong and the second author [\cite=Ko], and Tan and Hong [\cite=Hong]. Farhi and the first author [\cite=FK] also obtained some related results regarding [formula], which have recently been generalized to general arithmetic progressions by Hong and Qian [\cite=HQ].

In this article, we study finite arithmetic progressions {uk: = u0 + kr}nk = 0 with u0,r  ≥  1 integers satisfying (u0,r) = 1. Throughout, we let n  ≥  0 be a nonnegative integer and define

[formula]

to be the least common multiple of the sequence [formula].

We derive new lower bounds on Ln which improve upon those obtained previously when either u0 or n is large. After introducing relevant notation and preliminary results in Section [\ref=sec2], we develop and prove our bounds in Section [\ref=sec3]. Then, in Section [\ref=sec4], we show that our best bound is sharp up to a factor of n + 1 for u0 properly chosen and r prime. We study asymptotics for large n in Section [\ref=sec5], showing that our best bound is nearly sharp as n  →    ∞   when r is prime. We conclude in Section [\ref=sec6].

As we discuss in Section [\ref=sec6], our approach extends the methods of Hong and Feng [\cite=8] and the subsequent work ([\cite=HY] [\cite=Ko] [\cite=Hong]), pushing these methods nearly to their limits. The asymptotic estimates we obtain in Section [\ref=rem*] suggest that still better bounds may be possible, but these bounds will likely require new techniques.

Preliminaries

Following Hong and Feng [\cite=8] and the subsequent work, we denote, for each integer 0  ≤  k  ≤  n,

[formula]

From the latter definition, we have that Ln = Ln,0.

We now note two preliminary lemmata which we will use in the sequel. First, we state the following lemma which first appeared in [\cite=BF1] and has been reproven in several sources.

For any integer n  ≥  1, Cn,0|Ln.

From Lemma [\ref=L1], we see immediately that, for all k with 0  ≤  k  ≤  n,

[formula]

for an integer An,k  ≥  1.

Now, we introduce an intuitive lemma regarding the highest power of an integer dividing a factorial.

If s  ≥  0 and m  ≥  0 are positive integers, then sa|m! for some integer

[formula]

The proof of Lemma [\ref=factorialdivide] is a simple generalization of the well-known form of Lemma [\ref=factorialdivide] in the case that s is prime. Since Lemma [\ref=factorialdivide] does not appear to be easily accessible in the literature, we include its proof in Appendix [\ref=app1].

The Basic Bound

Given u0, r, and n as above, and letting k be an integer with 0  ≤  k  ≤  n, we have that

[formula]

where the product runs over primes p dividing r.

We begin by noting that

[formula]

We recall that Ln,k  =  Cn,kAn,k, where

[formula]

and An,k is an integer. We notice that any prime p dividing r does not divide [formula]. Therefore, since Ln,k is an integer, any power of p dividing (n - k)! must also divide An,k. By Lemma [\ref=factorialdivide], we know that (n - k)! is divisible by pap, with

[formula]

Hence, we have

[formula]

It then follows that

[formula]

We note that the term

[formula]

which arises in the product term of [\eqref=basiceq] is the quotient of an exponential by a polynomial. In particular, it grows quickly and is at least 1 as long as n - k  ≥  p - 1.

Additionally, we note a second bound which follows by an argument similar to that used to prove Theorem [\ref=basicbound].

Given u0, r, and n as above and letting k be an integer with 0  ≤  k  ≤  n, we have that

[formula]

The bounds of Theorems [\ref=basicbound] and [\ref=basicbound'] agree when r is prime. Also, we may rearrange the terms on the right-hand side of [\eqref=basiceq'] to obtain the following equivalent form of the bound [\eqref=basiceq'] of Theorem [\ref=basicbound'].

Given u0, r, and n as above and letting k be an integer with 0  ≤  k  ≤  n, we have that

[formula]

We now determine the value of k which yields the best bound in Corollary [\ref=niceboundcor]. It is clear that increasing k in [\eqref=nicebound] increases the right-hand term of [\eqref=nicebound] by a factor of

[formula]

Since this factor is decreasing in k, the optimal bound [\eqref=nicebound] is achieved when

[formula]

Remarks

The best previous bound on Ln is given by the following result of Tan and Hong [\cite=Hong].

Let [formula] by given integers. Then for any integers α  ≥  a and [formula] and [formula], we have that [formula].

Note that for n  ≥  r2(r + 1) the bound of Theorem [\ref=oldthm] is maximized when a  =  r and [formula] and [formula], yielding

[formula]

which is asymptotically weaker than our bound as n  →    ∞  .

The proof of Theorem [\ref=oldthm] comes from bounding An,k below by

[formula]

in the case that

[formula]

and then bounding Cn,k below by u0(r + 1)n. We improve upon Theorem [\ref=oldthm] in several ways. First, our lower bound on An,k is much better, provided that n is sufficiently large. Second, we pick the exact value of k which optimizes our lower bound. Lastly, we keep Cn,k in its native form, rather than replacing it by a smaller value; this improvement is particularly helpful when u0 is large.

Bounds for Large u0

When u0 is large, we have k* = 0 and therefore get the best bound from Corollary [\ref=niceboundcor] by setting k = 0 in [\eqref=nicebound]. This indicates that the following corollary of Theorem [\ref=nicebound] is sharpest for large u0.

Given u0, r, and n as above, we have that

[formula]

Remarks

If u0 is divisible by the part of [formula] relatively prime to r, then An,0 is just the largest divisor of n! divisible only by primes dividing r. In particular, if r is also prime, then the bound given in [\eqref=niceboundubig] is sharp up to the error in Lemma [\ref=factorialdivide]. On the other hand, it is the case that for p prime, the largest a so that pa|n! is at most n / (p - 1). Therefore, for appropriately chosen u0, and r prime, the bound [\eqref=niceboundubig] of Corollary [\ref=corubig] is sharp to within a factor of n + 1.

Asymptotics for Large n

We will now determine the asymptotics of the lower bound [\eqref=nicebound] of Corollary [\ref=niceboundcor] when n is large relative to u0 and r. We notice that for n large and k near its optimal value, k*, the multiplicative change in [\eqref=nicebound] as k is increased or decreased by 1 is close to 1. Furthermore, if the binomial coefficient in [\eqref=nicebound] is interpolated using the Gamma function, this will hold even for fractional values of k. Hence, we will still get the optimal bound asymptotically if we use [\eqref=nicebound] with any k within O(1) of k*.

Now, we set

[formula]

noting that * is with O(1) of k* for all n. We set

[formula]

hence if we take k = * in [\eqref=nicebound], the ratio of the terms in the binomial coefficient will equal β + 1. For ease of notation, we also denote

[formula]

so that the binomial coefficient in [\eqref=nicebound] with k = * is

[formula]

By Stirling's formula, [\eqref=stirmeplease] is asymptotic to

[formula]

It follows that our lower bound is asymptotic to

[formula]

The exponential part of [\eqref=asbound] is

[formula]

True Asymptotics

If we fix u0 and r, it is actually possible to derive an asymptotic formula for log (Ln). This is acheived by noting that

[formula]

where Λ(d) is the Von Mangoldt function. By definition, Λ(d) is zero unless d is a power of a prime. Furthermore, for d a power of a prime, d|Ln if and only if d|uk for some k (0  ≤  k  ≤  n). Therefore we have that

[formula]

Next, we observe that if n is sufficiently large, Ln will be divisible by all of the finitely many positive integers less than u0 and congruent to u0 modulo r. If this holds, the d in [\eqref=step1] will be exactly the d dividing some positive integer U  ≤  un with [formula]. Clearly the smallest positive integer congruent to u0 modulo r and divisible by d is [formula], where [formula] is the smallest positive representative of the conjugacy class of [formula] modulo r. Hence, we may break up the sum in [\eqref=step1] to obtain

[formula]

We recall that the inner sum in [\eqref=step2] is asymptotic to [formula], where φ is the Euler totient function (see [\cite=IK]). Therefore, we have that

[formula]

If we assume that r is prime, [\eqref=step3] reduces to

[formula]

where Hr - 1 denotes the (r - 1)-st harmonic number.

Remarks

We note that our proven asymptotic for log (Ln) has linear term

[formula]

where γ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant. The asymptotic lower bound [\eqref=asbound] we prove has exponential term [\eqref=exppart] with logarithm

[formula]

as we have [formula]. Thus, we see that our bound [\eqref=nicebound] of Corollary [\ref=niceboundcor] is within a multiplicative factor of approximately eγn of being asymptotically sharp.

Conclusion

Determining lower bounds on Ln is clearly equivalent to the problem of finding lower bounds for An,k. We have so far obtained these bounds by noting that, although Ln,k is always an integer, Cn,k need not be integral. In essence, this is the same strategy which has been applied in the work of Hong and Feng [\cite=8], Hong and Yang [\cite=HY], Hong and the second author [\cite=Ko], and Tan and Hong [\cite=Hong]. Unfortunately, in this article, we have apparently pushed these techniques nearly to their limits. It is relatively easy to show that Cn,k does not have in its denominator any prime factors which do not also divide r. Furthermore, we have accounted almost exactly for the contributions of these primes to the denominator of Cn,k. Hence, further progress towards bounding Ln should come from new techniques for bounding An,k.

Fortunately, there is hope that better bounds on An,k can be obtained. The proof that Cn,k divides Ln,k considers the potential common divisors of the elements [formula]. On the other hand, unless uk is chosen very carefully, not all of these common divisors actually appear. In particular, for An,k to have no factors prime to r, it will need to be the case that the part of n - k - m prime to r divides [formula] for each m. For each such divisibility condition which fails, we gain extra factors for An,k. Furthermore, we know that such factors must exist since (as was shown in Section [\ref=rem*]), for large n and prime r, our bound fails by a factor of roughly eγn.

Proof of Lemma [\ref=factorialdivide]

We notice that [formula] of the integers [formula] are divisible by s. More generally [formula] of these integers are divisible by si. Each such term provides us with a new factor of s dividing m!. Hence, if [formula], then sa|m!.

We now show that this a is at least [formula]. First, it follows easily by induction upon m that [formula], where d is the sum of the digits in the base-s representation of m. Thus, we need only show that

[formula]

To prove [\eqref=foo!], we first fix the value of d. We note that the smallest value of m that attains this value of d occurs when all of the base-s digits of m are s - 1, except for the leading digit, which is, say, [formula] ([formula]). We then have that [formula] and [formula] for some w and [formula] such that [formula]. We need to show that

[formula]

Canceling the additive terms of w on each side, all that is left to prove is that

[formula]

But [\eqref=laststepinlem] follows from the concavity of the logarithm function, since equality holds in [\eqref=laststepinlem] for [formula] and for [formula].
