LWFA as a Preinjector for XFEL Driver Linac

Introduction

LWFA is one of the cadidates for the future accelerator[\cite=1] [\cite=2]. On the high energy frontier, people want to use LWFA technique to construct compact linear collider; On the high quality beam frontier, the researchers try to use LWFA as FEL driver. There are many kinds of conventional electron guns, such as high voltage DC electron gun, microwave electron gun. Plasma based electron gun is a new kind of electron gun. Free electron laser is the full coherent light source and needs high brightness electron injector. Low emittance and high peak current are the aim we pursue. The conventional gun has the limit. Up to now, the best achieved normalized emittance of the photoinjector is 1mmmrad with the bunch charge of 1nC. If we need more bright electron bunch, we may use the new mechanism to produce the high quality electron beam.

Laser plasma based accelerator is a key research highlight in the field of new concept accelerator[\cite=3] [\cite=4] [\cite=5]. In the past, there are some proposals[\cite=6] [\cite=7] [\cite=8] [\cite=9] to use LWFA as the FEL driver linac directly. But it is difficult to get the stable high energy electron beam with the present LWFA experiment. So, LWFA may be the potential electron linac preinjector. This new kind of electron gun has the advantages of the ultrashort bunch length, the ultra-low emittance, and the high peak current quasi-monoenergetic electron beam. It is unnecessary to use the bunch compressor to get the high peak current beam with our proposed electron preinjector.

Laser wakefield accelerator

Laser wakefield accelerator ( LWFA )[\cite=2] [\cite=3] [\cite=4] [\cite=5] had a great breakthrough during the past 4-5 years. With the discovery of the bubble mechanism, the 1 GeV or so quasi-monoenergetic electron beam is obtained in the LWFA experiments[\cite=3] [\cite=4] [\cite=5]. The energy spread is still several percent and can not used as the FEL driver. But this produced beam can be used as the high brighness electron injector due to their low normalized emittance, ultrashort bunch length, and high peak current. In this case, we just need tens of MeV high quality electron bunch to be used as the preinjector of the driver linac.

Application for next generation light source-Free Electron Laser

In[\cite=6], we propose a new mechanism LWFA to produce femtosecond electron bunch with the bunch length of 2fs, and the peak current of 750A. this kind of electron bunch can be used to produce ultrashort Terahertz coherent radiation. The peak current is also high enough to drive soft X-ray free electron laser, if we boost the beam energy to 1GeV or so.

In this paper, as an example, we give the 2D PIC simulation[\cite=10] example result of one LWFA experiment design with the peak current in the range of 15 - 20kA. The used code is Vorpal[\cite=10], Vorpal is an object-oriented PIC code developed by Tech-X Corporation. The typical laser paremeters are the wavelength of 800 nm, the pulse length of 1.6μm, the beam waist of 2.2μm and the peak intensity of [formula]. The typical plasma parameters are the plasma density of [formula]. Table 1 gives the main parameters.

Under these parameters, we can get the electron beam with the energy of 37MeV, the bunch charge of   ~  40pC, the bunch length of   ~  1fs, the normalized emittance of 1.2mmmrad, and the rms energy spread of 3.9%. Figure 1 shows the output 2D density distribution of the produced electron beam.

We analyze the phase space of the bunched beam in the bubble. Figure 2 shows the output beam phase space.

Figure 3 shows the current profile, the peak current can reach 15 - 20kA.

Then, we use this injector to set up soft x-ray free electron laser experiment. We add the booster linac after the lwfa injector to boost the beam energy to the energy of 1 GeV. The linac can choose SLAC 2856MHz S-band accelerating structure or Spring-8 5712MHz accelerating structure. Due to the high peak current and femtosecond bunch length, we don't use the bunch compressor to obtain the high peak current bunch to drive XFEL process. We use the typical beam parameters: the energy of 1GeV, the normalized emittance of 1.2mmmrad, the energy spread of 0.1%, and the peak current of 15 - 20kA.

We use M.Xie's fitting formula[\cite=11] to estimate the SASE mode FEL output. Using the mature undulator parameters: the period of 3cm, and the gap of 1cm. The typical output parameters are the wavelength of 12.5nm, the peak output laser power of 90GW, the saturation length of 8m, and the gain length of 0.33m. The analytically estimated peak power is bigger than the simulated peak power (~  40GW) by GENESIS. The main parameters are summaried in Table 2.

Using GENESIS[\cite=12] to do time independent and dependent simulation, the typical output peak power is shown as

the simulation shows the output peak power is about 40GW which is smaller than the analytically estimated value , and the saturation length is about 8m. Figure 6 shows the output laser spectrum.

Discussion

In order to use LWFA as the electron injector, we have to solve some issues, such as the stability problem, the timing problem, etc. As we know, the conventional electron injector is more stable than LWFA. As the output electron bunch is in the order of femtosecond, the timing jitter will also be in this order. Therefore, the timing jitter problem maybe not a serious problem for our case.
