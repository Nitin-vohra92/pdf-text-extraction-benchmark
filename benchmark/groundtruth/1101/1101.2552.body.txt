A note on approximate subgroups of [formula] and uniformly nonamenable groups

Introduction

Throughout this paper [formula] is a real number. We begin by recalling, very briefly, the notions of K-approximate group and of control. For a more leisurely introduction we refer the reader to our paper [\cite=bgt-long].

Suppose that A is a finite set in some group which is symmetric in the sense that the identity lies in A and a- 1∈A whenever a∈A. Then we say that A is a K-approximate group if there is some symmetric set X, [formula], such that A2  ⊆  AX. If B is some other set then we say that A is K-controlled by B if [formula] and if there is some set X, [formula], such that [formula].

If P is some property that a group may have, such as being linear, nilpotent or solvable, then by a P K-approximate group we mean an approximate group A for which the group 〈A〉 generated by A has property P.

Modulo a little fairly standard multiplicative combinatorics, the following result was proved by Hrushovski [\cite=hrush].

Suppose that [formula] is a K-approximate group. Then A is OK,n(1)-controlled by B, a solvable KO(1)-approximate group.

By combining this with the main result of [\cite=bg-solv] one immediately obtains the following extension.

Suppose that [formula] is a K-approximate group. Then A is OK,n(1)-controlled by B, a nilpotent KO(1)-approximate group.

Hrushovski's result was proven using model theory and so did not lead to an explicit form for the OK,n(1) term in Theorem [\ref=mainthm], even in principle. A different proof of this result was established by the authors in [\cite=bgt-long], and this gave a stronger result in the sense that the OK,n(1) term was shown to vary polynomially in K. We obtained a bound of the form CnKC'n where C'n could have been computed if desired (and would take the form exp (nO(1))), but Cn could not as a consequence of our dependence on ultrafilters to prove quantitative algebraic geometry estimates in [\cite=bgt-long]. A more explicit approach to these estimates is taken in the paper of Pyber and Szabo [\cite=pyber-szabo] who, subsequent to our work in [\cite=bgt-long], obtain a result (Theorem 10 of their paper) which is in principle explicit.

Our aim here is to show how Theorem [\ref=mainthm] follows quickly from various results in the literature, the most substantial of these being the so-called uniform Tits alternative of the first author. The argument is largely distinct from both of the previous two proofs of Theorem [\ref=mainthm]. It gives a term OK,n(1) of the form exp (KO(m(n) log K)), where m(n) is the constant appearing in the uniform Tits alternative (see Proposition [\ref=uniform-tits] below). This is effective in principle. However, computing an explicit bound for m(n) would not only involve chasing constants in [\cite=breuillard-uniformtits], but would also require the effective version of § 2 of [\cite=breuillard-gap] proven in [\cite=breuillard-effective]. The exponential nature of OK,n(1) with respect to K stems from the bound in Proposition [\ref=sanders-cs], which is a consequence of a recent result of Sanders [\cite=sanders] and Croot-Sisask [\cite=croot-sisask].

Finally, we note that the proof of Theorem [\ref=mainthm] above generalizes easily to uniformly nonamenable groups. Say that a group G is κ-uniformly nonamenable if whenever X is a finite subset of G which generates a non-amenable subgroup, then [formula] for every finite subset A in G and some κ > 0. The uniform Tits alternative implies that [formula] is κd-uniformly non-amenable, for some κd > 0. Similarly it can be shown (see Koubi [\cite=koubi]) that δ-hyperbolic groups are uniformly nonamenable, and it is known that their amenable subgroups are infinite cyclic-by-bounded. In this setting we obtain the following result.

Let G be a κ-uniformly nonamenable group. Suppose that A  ⊆  G is a K-approximate group. Then A is exp (KO( log K / κ))-controlled by B, an amenable KO(1)-approximate group.

Although Theorem [\ref=mainthm2] applies to δ-hyperbolic groups, and thus says that any approximate subgroup is controlled by an approximate subgroup of a cyclic subgroup, it is likely that our bound can be improved a lot for these groups in the spirit of Safin's bound [\cite=safin] in the free group case (he obtained a bound of the form Oε(K2 + ε)).

Six lemmas

In this section we assemble the tools from the literature that we require to prove Theorem [\ref=mainthm]. The title of the section is hardly accurate, since some of these results are quite substantial.

Let [formula] be an integer. Then there is an integer m  =  m(n) with the following property: if [formula] is a finite symmetric set then either the group 〈A〉 generated by A is virtually solvable, or else Am contains two elements generating a free subgroup of [formula].

This is the "Uniform Tits Alternative" of the first author [\cite=breuillard-uniformtits].

The following result is a straightforward consequence of a lemma of Sanders [\cite=sanders]. For very closely related results, see [\cite=croot-sisask] and [\cite=schoen].

Suppose that A is a K-approximate group. Then for any ε  >  0 and [formula] there are sets A'  ⊆  A5, B  ⊆  A4 with [formula], |B|  ≫  K,m,ε|A| and [formula].

Let k  =  k(ε,K) be an integer to be specified later. It is shown in Sanders [\cite=sanders] that there is a symmetric set B containing the identity such that [formula] and Bkm  ⊆  A4. We have the nesting

[formula]

Note that [formula]. Supposing that

[formula]

it follows from the pigeonhole principle that there is some j, [formula] such that, setting A': = ABjm, we have

[formula]

These sets A' and B then satisfy the requirements of the proposition.

Suppose that A is a subset of some group G and that X is a further subset of G containing the identity and two elements generating a nonabelian free group. Then [formula].

This is basically the observation, originally due to von Neumann, made whilst proving that every group containing a non-abelian free subgroup F2 is not amenable using Følner's criterion; see for example the notes of the third author [\cite=tao-amenable-blog] or the remarks on page 4 of [\cite=breuillard-uniformtits].

Suppose that [formula] is virtually solvable. Then there is a solvable subgroup [formula] such that   =  On(1).

This result of Mal'cev-Platonov is proved in [\cite=bgt-long].

Let [formula], and suppose that A is a K-approximate solvable subgroup of [formula]. Then A is KOn(1)-controlled by a KO(1)-approximate nilpotent subgroup.

This is essentially the main result of [\cite=bg-solv]. There is one difference, in that here we obtain a KO(1)-approximate group rather than a KOn(1)-approximate group. However, this stronger statement follows easily from the weaker one and the additive-combinatorial lemma below.

Finally, we require a standard additive combinatorics lemma.

Let 0  <  δ  <  1, [formula] and [formula] be parameters. Suppose that A is a K-approximate group of some ambient group G, and that [formula] is a subgroup with the property that Ak intersects some coset Hx in a set of size δ|A|. Then [formula] is a 2K3-approximate group which 2K2k + 4  /  δ-controls A.

According to [\cite=bg-compact], [formula] is a 2K3-approximate group and [formula]. Moreover [formula]. An appeal to Ruzsa's covering lemma ends the proof.

Proof of the main theorem

This is a very short task given the ingredients we assembled in the previous section. Let [formula] be a K-approximate group. By Proposition [\ref=sanders-cs], applied with ε  =  0.1 (say) and with m  =  m(n) the quantity appearing in Proposition [\ref=uniform-tits], there are sets A'  ⊆  A5, B  ⊆  A4 with [formula] and |B|  ≫  n,K|A| such that [formula]. By Proposition [\ref=f2-na], Bm cannot contain two elements generating a nonabelian free group. By the uniform Tits alternative, B must generate a virtually solvable group G. By Proposition [\ref=malcev-platanov], this G contains a solvable subgroup H with   =  On(1), and so by the pigeonhole principle there is some x such that [formula]. This implies that

[formula]

At this point we may apply Lemma [\ref=standard-add-comb] to conclude that [formula] is a 2K3-approximate solvable group which OK,n(1)-controls A. Finally, an application of Proposition [\ref=solv-to-nil] completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=mainthm].

We leave the proof of Theorem [\ref=mainthm2], which proceeds along almost identical lines but does not require Proposition [\ref=malcev-platanov] or Proposition [\ref=solv-to-nil], to the reader.
