On stationary solutions to reaction-diffusion equations with nonlocal term

Introduction

Consider the following parabolic-elliptic system, motivated by some astrophysical models of self-gravitating particles (cf. [\cite=CSR]) and derived by statistical mechanics approach (cf. [\cite=BS-K]),

[formula]

where n = n(x,t) is a nonnegative density of the particles inducing the gravitational potential φ  =  φ(x,t), the pressure term P depending on nθ- d / 2 and any positive (otherwise irrelevant for stationary problem) coefficient N. Note that total mass of the system is conserved, i.e., [formula]. The system can be reduced to one nonlocal equation of reaction-diffusion type if we plug φ  =    -  Δ- 1n into the first equation.

Stationary solutions can be derived by multiplication of the first eqution in ([\ref=par]) by θH + φ (where H'(z) = P'(z) / z) and integration to yield

[formula]

For radially symmetric Ω, e.g. a unit ball of radius one B(0,1) looking for radial solutions in the form of integrated densities [formula] we are reduced to the following singular boundary value problem (cf. for R = Id [\cite=BDEMN], [\cite=BN])

[formula]

for the given mass parameter m > 0 and σd being the measure of the unit sphere in [formula] θ = 1 and R(z) = 1 / H'(z). Indeed, differentiating H(n) = c - φ and using radial symmetry yields the claim.

Next integrating the above equation twice and using the boundary conditions we can reduce the above problem to looking for fixed points of the following operator

[formula]

where a symmetric function G is given by

Main results

Now, we are ready to formulate the main result of this paper.

Assume that the function R is globally Lipschitz continuous with constant L and R(0) = 0. Then, for sufficiently small positive mass parameter m there exists at least one solution to (). Moreover, if R = Id then the function Q(r)r2 - d is non-decreasing.

Proof. Next note that if R is locally Lipschitz continuous then in the weighted sup norm |Q|α  =   sup r∈(0,1)|Q(r)rα| for α  ≤  0 the estimates hold

[formula]

for some constants A1,A2 depending on the Lipschitz constant of R (call it L) and the dimension of the space [formula] To be more specific 2A1σd(d - 2) = L and 2A2σd(d - 2) = L(d + 4). Moreover, similarly one can get the estimates

[formula]

where the constants are defined as: 2A3σd(d - 2) = L + 1 and 2A4σd(d - 2) = L(d + 4) + 1. Thus T is a contraction on some ball B(0,ρ) in the following subspace of C1 - C1d  =  {Q∈C1:|Q|2 - d  <    ∞  ,|Q'|3 - d  <    ∞  } with the weighted sup norm

[formula]

provided that

[formula]

yielding the existence of a fixed point for T and thus a solution to (). Note that if m is sufficiently small then one can find ρ∈(ρ1m,ρ2m) satisfying ([\ref=sma]) for some suitably chosen ρ1m,ρ2m.

To prove another part of the claim for R = Id we use the property of invariance of the cone [formula] under the action of the operator T provided mass is sufficiently small (m < 2σd).
