Subgaussian Rates of Convergence of Means in Directed First Passage Percolation

Introduction

The question of the order of the fluctuations (i.e. the standard deviation) for the passage time over a distance n in first passage percolation (FPP) has attracted considerable interest. FPP is believed to be one of a family of models in which these fluctuations are of order n1 / 3 in two dimensions, with a Tracy-Widom distributional limit under corresponding scaling. In three dimensions the conjectured order is nχ with χ near 1/4. Little is known rigorously in this regard, however, and even physicists do not agree on the behavior of the exponent χ as the dimension becomes large. For directed last passage percolation in two dimensions with geometrically distributed passage times, the n1 / 3 scale and the Tracy-Widom distributional limit were proved in [\cite=Jo01], but the "exact solution" methods used there do not seem conducive to use with more general passage time distributions. (A more probabilitistic proof for geometrically distributed passage times is in [\cite=CG06].) For longest increasing subsequences, which can be transformed into an FPP-like problem, analogous results were established in [\cite=BDJ99]. For first passage percolation, fluctuations are known to be subgaussian, but barely--Benjamini, Kalai and Schramm [\cite=BKS03] showed that for Bernoulli-distributed passage times, the fluctuations are O((n /  log n)1 / 2), and Benaïm and Rossignol [\cite=BR08] proved exponential bounds, on the scale (n /  log n)1 / 2, for the fluctuations under more general passage time distributions, improving Kesten's exponential bounds [\cite=Ke93] which are on scale n1 / 2.

Here by an exponential bound on scale cn we mean that, letting a0n be the passage time from the origin to (n,0,...,0), one has P(|a0n  -  Ea0n|  >  tcn) decaying exponentially in t, uniformly in n.

Besides deviations from the mean, it is of interest to understand deviations from the asymptotic value nμ, where μ is the time constant. This means that, letting a0n be the passage time from the origin to (n,0,...,0), we need bounds for Ea0n  -  nμ. Subadditivity of Ea0n ensures that this difference is nonnegative. The best known bound, in [\cite=Al93], is of order n1 / 2 log n, obtained with the help of Kesten's scale-n1 / 2 exponential bounds on fluctuations. In [\cite=Al97], analogous results are established for a wider class of models, and the proofs there show that for FPP in two or three dimensions, if one has an exponential bound on some scale cn, then

[formula]

For the proven scale cn  =  (n /  log n)1 / 2 from [\cite=BR08], though, this approach obviously does not lead to a subgaussian (i.e. o(n1 / 2)) bound on Ea0n  -  nμ. Our aim here is to establish such a subgaussian bound by other methods, showing that in the directed case, for a reasonably wide class of passage time distributions, we have

[formula]

To formalize things, we write sites of [formula] as (n,x) with [formula]. Let [formula] be the even sublattice of [formula]:

[formula]

Sites (n,x) and (n + 1,y) in [formula] are adjacent if the Euclidean distance |y - x|2 = 1. A bond 〈(n,x),(n + 1,y)〉 is a pair of adjacent sites, and [formula] denotes the set of all bonds in [formula]. We assign i.i.d. nonnegative passage times [formula] to the bonds in [formula], with distribution ν. A (directed lattice) path from (n,x) to (n + m,y) in [formula] is a sequence of sites [formula] in which consecutive sites are adjacent, or it may be viewed as the corresponding sequence of bonds; which one should be clear from the context. The passage time for a path γ is

[formula]

For sites (n,x),(n + m,y) in [formula], we then define

[formula]

and for n even,

[formula]

A geodesic is a path which achieves this minimum; the geodesic is a.s. unique when ωb has a continuous distribution. The time constant μ  =  μ(ν,d) is

[formula]

the existence of the first limit (taken through even n) being a consequence of subadditivity and the second being a consequence of Kingman's subadditive ergodic theorem [\cite=Ki68].

In order to use the exponential bound of [\cite=BR08], we need to assume that ν is a nearly gamma distribution, as defined in [\cite=BR08]. To state the definition, let F and Φ be the d.f.'s of ν and the standard normal distribution, respectively. Assume ν has a density f, and let φ be the density of the standard normal. Define I  =  {t  ≥  0:f(t) > 0} and on I define the function

[formula]

The distribution ν is said to be nearly gamma if I is an interval, f restricted to I is continuous, and for some positive A,

[formula]

For a standard normal variable ξ, F- 1(Φ(ξ)) has distribution ν, and the nearly gamma property ensures that the map [formula] is nice enough that a log Sobolev inequality for ξ translates into useful information about ν; see [\cite=BR08]. Most common continuous distributions are nearly gamma--a sufficient condition for the property, from [\cite=BR08], is as follows. Let a < b be the (possibly infinite) endpoints of I. Suppose that for some α >  - 1,

[formula]

and either (i) b <   ∞   and for some β >  - 1,

[formula]

or (ii) b =   ∞   and

[formula]

Then ν is nearly gamma.

We can now state our main result.

Suppose ν is nearly gamma and [formula] for some t > 0. Then for even n,

[formula]

This bound is likely not sharp--an exponential bound on the expected scale n1 / 3 would lead to [\eqref=cnbound] with cn = n1 / 3, for example.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=main]

We consider paths {(i,x(i)):0  ≤  i  ≤  kn} from (0,0) to (kn,0), for some block length n to be specified and k  ≥  1. In general we take n sufficiently large, and then take k large, depending on n; we tacitly take n to be even, throughout. The simple skeleton of such a path is {(jn,x(jn)):0  ≤  j  ≤  k}. The number of possible simple skeletons is at most (2n)dk, so if we have a probability associated to each skeleton which is bounded by some quantity e- rnk, then in order for the corresponding bound (2n)dke- rnk on the sum to be small, we should have rn at least of order log n. This principle, in a different context, underlies the log n factor which appears in [\eqref=cnbound]. In [\eqref=rate2] we essentially want to replace this log n with log  log n. Since (2n)dk is unacceptably large for this, it requires entropy reduction--the replacement of a sum over all simple skeletons with the sum over a small subclass which can be shown to approximate the full class of simple skeletons appropriately. This entropy reduction is the main theme of our proof.

Our main technical tool is the following. It is proved in [\cite=BR08] for undirected FPP, but the proof for the directed case is the same. The result there carries the additional hypothesis that t  ≤  m, but that is readily removed--the proof is in Section [\ref=S:lemmas].

Suppose ν is nearly gamma and [formula] for some t > 0. Then there exist C1,C2 > 0 such that for all m  ≥  2 and [formula] with |x|1  ≤  m,

[formula]

If the exponential bound [\eqref=expbound] could be improved to some scale cm  ≪  (m /  log m)1 / 2, then the rate on the right side of [\eqref=rate2] could improved to O(cn log  log n), with the proof virtually unchanged.

Let [formula]. A routine extension of Theorem [\ref=BR] to sums of passage times is as follows. We postpone the proof to Section [\ref=S:lemmas].

Let ν,C1,C2 be as in Theorem [\ref=BR], let nmax  ≥  1 and let [formula] with tj - sj  ≤  nmax for all j  ≤  r. For each j  ≤  r let (sj,y(j))∈Hsj and (tj,z(j))∈Htj, and let Tj  =  T((sj,y(j)),(tj,z(j))). Then for C3 = C2 / (C1 + 1), for a > 0,

[formula]

For [formula] define the excess mean s(m,x) by

[formula]

Nonnegativity of s follows from [\eqref=mudef], symmetry and subadditivity:

[formula]

and clearly s(n,  ·  ) is invariant under reflections across axes and under permutations of coordinates. Let

[formula]

For our designated block length n, for [formula] with [formula], we say the transverse increment x is excessive if s(n,x)  >  n1 / 2θ(n), and unexcessive otherwise. Note the dependence on n is suppressed in this terminology. From [\cite=Al93] we know that there exists C0 such that

[formula]

from which it follows readily that provided n is large, all x with |x|  ≤  n1 / 2 log n are unexcessive. (As with Theorem [\ref=BR], [\eqref=sbound] is stated in [\cite=Al93] for undirected FPP, but the proof for the directed case is the same.) Let

[formula]

and let x* be an unexcessive site with |x*| = hn and x*1  =  |x*|∞. We wish to coarse-grain on scale un  =  2⌊hn / 2φ(n)⌋; note un is an even integer. A coarse-grained (or CG) point is a point of form (jn,x(jn)) with j  ≥  0 and [formula]. A coarse-grained (or CG) skeleton is a simple skeleton {(jn,x(jn)):0  ≤  j  ≤  k} consisting entirely of CG points.

By a CG path we mean a path from (0,0) to (kn,0) for which the simple skeleton is a CG skeleton. We proceed as follows. Given the geodesic Γ from (0,0) to (kn,0), we would like to reroute Γ into a CG path Γ̃ by changing it only within distance n1  ≤  6dn / φ(n) of each hyperplane Hjn, and in such a way that with high probability the passage times of Γ and Γ̃ are close. (Here n1 is an even integer to be specified, cf. Lemma [\ref=cutpaste].) Once this is done, we would hope to achieve entropy reduction by effectively considering only CG paths. What we actually do is slightly different--Γ̃ is not necessarily a true CG path but rather a sequence of segments each (with certain exceptions) having CG points as endpoints, with one segment not required to connect to the next one. But the effect is the same.

To this end, given a site w = (jn  ±  n1,y(jn  ±  n1))∈Hjn  ±  n1, let z(jn) be the site in [formula] closest to y(jn  ±  n1) in [formula] norm (breaking ties by some arbitrary rule), and let πjn(w)  =  (jn,z(jn)), which may be viewed as the projection into Hjn of the CG approximation to w within the hyperplane Hjn  ±  n1. Given the geodesic Γ  =  {(i,x(i))} from (0,0) to (kn,0), define points

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

We say a sidestep occurs in block j if either

[formula]

Let

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

and let

[formula]

Define the tuples

[formula]

and define the CG-approximate skeleton of Γ to be

[formula]

Note Eside(Γ) is a function of SCG(Γ). Let C denote the class of all possible CG-approximate skeletons of paths from (0,0) to (kn,0), and for [formula] let CB denote the class of all CG-approximate skeletons in C with E = B. SCG(Γ) is thus a sequence of tuples of sites; in each tuple the first and last sites will be used as the endpoints of a path which approximates one of the k segments of Γ.

For a CG-approximate skeleton in CB, if [formula] are specified and j∈B, then there are at most (2hnu- 1n + 1)2d  ≤  (3φ(n))2d possible values of Rj; if j∉B there are at most (2n)4d. It follows that the number of CG-approximate skeletons satisfies

[formula]

Note that the factor φ(n) in place of n in [\eqref=CB] represents the entropy reduction discussed above. For each j∉E let gj(Γ) be the path from ej - 1' to fj', via ej - 1 and fj, obtained from Γ by replacing the segment of Γ from dj - 1 to ej - 1 with the geodesic from ej - 1' to ej - 1, and replacing the segment of Γ from fj to dj with the geodesic from fj to fj'. For j∈E let gj(Γ) be the segment of Γ from dj - 1 to dj. Then define the collection of paths

[formula]

Note that for j∉E, gj(Γ) has CG points as endpoints. We define the passage time in the natural way:

[formula]

Let [formula]. Taking k sufficiently large (depending on n), we have

[formula]

where the first inequality follows from the definition of μ. We will show that the first two probabilities on the right side are small, and then, since the third probability cannot also be small, we will see that we must have

[formula]

which in turn leads easily to [\eqref=rate2]. For the second probability on the right side of [\eqref=twocases] we have

[formula]

Given [formula] and {Rj}∈CB, for some vj - 1',wj',pj - 1,vj - 1,wj,pj we can express {Rj} as

[formula]

Then let IB({Rj}) be the set of all tuple collections {(pj - 1,vj - 1,wj,pj):j∉B} compatible with {Rj} and having the following properties:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Here by "compatible with {Rj}" we mean that the choice of {Rj} specifies values pi for certain i (specifically, for i = j and i = j - 1 for each j∈B); the tuple collections in IB({Rj}) must use these same values pi. Note that pj - 1,vj - 1,wj,pj are possible values of the variables dj - 1,ej - 1,fj,dj, respectively, and

[formula]

Then let

[formula]

Then

[formula]

It may be noted that we have modified Γ into Γ̃ so that we need only sum over CG-approximate skeletons, rather than over all simple skeletons, and we thereby achieved entropy reduction, but now in [\eqref=skeldecomp2], the number of terms in the sum effectively increases the entropy back to its original level. However we have the advantage that all the path lengths involved in [\eqref=skeldecomp2] are at most n1, not n as in the simple skeleton, so Lemma [\ref=sums] will give a better bound, which will be sufficient to overcome the additional entropy.

To bound the first probability on the right side of [\eqref=skeldecomp2], we have

[formula]

To bound the first probability on the right side of [\eqref=leftend], we need an upper bound for ET(π(j - 1)n(vj - 1),vj - 1), supplied by the next lemma. We postpone the proof to Section [\ref=S:lemmas].

Provided n is sufficiently large, there exists an even integer n1  ≤  6dn / φ(n) such that for every v∈Hn1 we have

[formula]

It follows from Lemmas [\ref=sums] (with nmax = n1) and [\ref=cutpaste] that provided n is large,

[formula]

and the same bound holds for the second probability in [\eqref=leftend], so [\eqref=leftend] yields

[formula]

This bound also holds for the last probability in [\eqref=skeldecomp2], which with [\eqref=size] and [\eqref=skeldecomp2] shows that

[formula]

Then from [\eqref=CB] and [\eqref=skeldecomp], provided n is large,

[formula]

We turn now to the first probability on the right side of [\eqref=twocases]. Here we use the non-coarse-grained analogs of the Rj, given by

[formula]

and define the augmented skeleton of Γ to be

[formula]

Note that Eside(Γ) and Eex(Γ) are functions of Saug(Γ). Let C+aug denote the class of all augmented skeletons for which |E|  ≥  bnk. For a given {Vj,1  ≤  j  ≤  k}∈C+aug, for some [formula] and pj,vj,wj we can write {Vj,1  ≤  j  ≤  k}∈C+aug as

[formula]

and we then define

[formula]

where we take p0 = 0. (Note this definition is consistent with [\eqref=timedef].) For j∈Eside, a sidestep occurs either from pj - 1 to vj - 1 or from wj to pj. In the former case, writing vj - 1 as ((j - 1)n + n1,y) for some [formula], let bj  =  (jn,y). From the definitions of "sidestep" and hn we have using [\eqref=sbound] that

[formula]

so assuming n is large,

[formula]

and hence

[formula]

The last bound holds similarly if the sidestep instead occurs from wj to pj, so

[formula]

Therefore by Lemma [\ref=sums] (with nmax = n) and [\eqref=slowlyvar], provided n is large,

[formula]

Now we consider the third probability on the right side of [\eqref=twocases]. From [\eqref=twocases], [\eqref=diffspeed] and [\eqref=skeldecomp3] we have

[formula]

From here we proceed by contradiction. Suppose that

[formula]

Then for the probability on the right of [\eqref=skeldecomp4] we have from Lemma [\ref=sums] (with nmax = n) that

[formula]

and then using [\eqref=CB] and [\eqref=skeldecomp4],

[formula]

which is clearly false. Therefore the inequality in [\eqref=hypoth] must fail for some x, and then

[formula]

provided n is sufficiently large, which completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=main]. Note that [\eqref=skeldecomp5] shows the purpose of entropy reduction--if φ(n) were replaced by n, we would have to have log n in place of log  log n in the definition of ψ(n).

Proofs of Lemmas and Theorem [\ref=BR]

As mentioned in the introduction, the theorem is proved in [\cite=BR08] under the additional hypothesis that t  ≤  m, so we assume t > m. Let μ1 = E(ωb), let γ(m,x) be a (nonrandom) path from (0,0) to (m,x) and write T(m,x) for T((0,0),(m,x)). Let m1,m2 satisfy

[formula]

We can always choose C1,C2 so that C1e- C2t  ≥  1 for all t  ≤  m2, so we may assume t > m2. If m  ≥  m1, then since t > m we have

[formula]

while if m  <  m1 then [\eqref=mu1bound] follows from t > m2. Either way, since T(m,x)  ≥  0 and ET(m,x)  ≤  mμ1, we then have

[formula]

Further, by [\eqref=mu1bound],

[formula]

so, letting I denote the rate function of the variable ωb  -  Eωb,

[formula]

Since I is convex, there exists C4 > 0 such that I(x)  ≥  2C4x for all x  ≥  1 / 2, and we have

[formula]

so by [\eqref=LD],

[formula]

which completes the proof.

We have

[formula]

By Theorem [\ref=BR], for each j, letting rj  =  tj - sj, for [formula],

[formula]

Letting [formula], since rj  ≤  nmax we obtain [formula] and then by [\eqref=markovbound],

[formula]

The same bound holds for [formula].

For the proof of Lemma [\ref=cutpaste] we need the following. We say (m,x) is slow if

[formula]

and fast otherwise. A path [formula] is clean if every increment (t - s,x(t) - x(s)) with 0  ≤  s  <  t  ≤  m is fast.

Given a path γ  =  {(m,x(m))} from (0,0) to (n,x*), let

[formula]

The climbing skeleton of γ is C(γ)  =  {(τj,x(τj)):1  ≤  j  ≤  φ(n)}. A climbing segment of γ is a segment of γ from (τj - 1,x(τj - 1)) to (τj,x(τj)) for some j. A climbing segment is short if τj  -  τj - 1  ≤  2n / φ(n), and long otherwise. (Note n / φ(n) is the average length of the climbing segments in γ.) Since the total length of γ is n, there can be at most φ(n) / 2 long climbing segments in γ, so there are at least φ(n) / 2 short ones.

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

If no short climbing segment of γ is clean, then for each j∈Js(γ) there exist αj(γ) < βj(γ) in
