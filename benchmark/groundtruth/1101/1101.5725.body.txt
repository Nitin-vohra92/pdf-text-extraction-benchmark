Function spectra and continuous G-spectra

Introduction

In this paper, all of our spectra are symmetric spectra of simplicial sets and we use G to denote a profinite group. Also, as in [\cite=joint], we let [formula] be the category of discrete G-spectra. Thus, if [formula], then, in particular, X is a symmetric spectrum with a G-action and the symmetric sequence {Xi}i  ≥  0 of simplicial G-sets has the property that, for each j  ≥  0, the action map on j-simplices,

[formula]

is continuous, when the set (Xi)j is regarded as a discrete space.

As in [\cite=joint], let

[formula]

be a cofiltered diagram in [formula]; thus, {Xα}α is a pro-discrete G-spectrum. Following [\cite=joint], we refer to the diagram {Xα}α as a continuous G-spectrum and the G-homotopy fixed point spectrum of the spectrum [formula] is defined by

[formula]

Now let Z be any spectrum with trivial G-action and let [formula] be the function spectrum. We can write the spectrum Z as

[formula]

a homotopy colimit of a directed system of finite spectra Zβ, and hence,

[formula]

where DZβ is the Spanier-Whitehead dual of Zβ. We regard each DZβ as having trivial G-action, so that each [formula], with the diagonal G-action, is a discrete G-spectrum. Thus, the diagram [formula] is a continuous G-spectrum and hence, it is natural to make the following definition.

If {Xα}α is a continuous G-spectrum and Z is a spectrum with trivial G-action, then we define

[formula]

where the second equality follows immediately from Definition ([\ref=hfps]).

Now suppose that G has finite vcd (that is, "finite virtual cohomological dimension"): this assumption means exactly that there is a natural number m and an open subgroup U of G such that Hsc(U;M)  =  0, whenever s > m, for all discrete U-modules M. Here, Hsc(U;M) is the continuous cohomology of the profinite group U, with coefficients in M.

The above assumption of finite vcd, combined with [\cite=cts] and the fact that each DZβ is a finite spectrum, justifies the first equivalence in the following:

[formula]

The above string of equivalences and the discussion that precedes it prove the following result.

In the case when G is finite, Theorem [\ref=maintool] is well-known. Also, there is a quick and interesting application of this result to chromatic homotopy theory. To see this, we need to pause to introduce the main actors, along with some notation.

Let n  ≥  1, let p be a fixed prime, and let En be the Lubin-Tate spectrum with

[formula]

where [formula] is the ring of Witt vectors of the field [formula], each ui has degree zero, and the degree of u is - 2. Also, set

[formula]

the extended Morava stabilizer group; Gn is a profinite group of finite vcd. Finally, let K(n) be the nth Morava K-theory spectrum, LK(n)(S0) the K(n)-local sphere, and

[formula]

a tower of generalized Moore spectra, each of which is finite, such that there is an equivalence [formula] where E(n) is the Johnson-Wilson spectrum (see [\cite=HoveyCech]).

We recall that in [\cite=DH], for any closed subgroup K of Gn, Devinatz and Hopkins construct a commutative S-algebra EdhKn that behaves like a K-homotopy fixed point spectrum. (We note that instead of the notation EdhKn, [\cite=DH] uses "EhKn." However, we reserve the notation EhKn for the homotopy fixed point spectrum of En that is formed with respect to the continuous action of K on En (as in [\cite=cts]).) Following [\cite=cts], we use this construction of Devinatz and Hopkins to define

[formula]

where the colimit is over all open normal subgroups of Gn; since each EdhNn is a (Gn / N)-spectrum, Fn is a discrete Gn-spectrum and [formula] is a continuous Gn-spectrum. Then there is the equivalence

[formula]

thanks to [\cite=DH] and [\cite=joint].

Now we are ready to return to Theorem [\ref=maintool]: if G  =  Gn, {Xα}α is set equal to [formula], and [formula], then this result - together with Definition [\ref=defone] - makes precise and justifies the assertion

[formula]

which occurs in [\cite=Rognes]. More generally, if Z is any spectrum with trivial Gn-action, there is the equivalence

[formula]

where the left-hand side in this equivalence,

[formula]

is equivalent to the K(n)-local Spanier-Whitehead dual of the K(n)-local spectrum LK(n)(Z). Thus, the functional dual in the K(n)-local category is given by Gn-homotopy fixed points.

In addition to the above conclusions, Theorem [\ref=maintool] is also useful for further developing the theory of homotopy fixed points in at least two other ways: it plays a role in obtaining Theorem [\ref=iterated], which is a result about iterated homotopy fixed points for a certain type of profinite Galois extension; and, for K any closed subgroup of Gn and Z any spectrum, we show in Theorem [\ref=secondmain] that the strongly convergent Adams-type spectral sequence with abutment [formula], constructed by Devinatz and Hopkins in [\cite=DH], is actually a descent spectral sequence for the homotopy fixed point spectrum F(Z,En)hK. To keep this Introduction from being unnecessarily redundant, we defer a fuller exposition of these two applications to Sections [\ref=sectiontwo] and [\ref=sectionthree].

Iterated homotopy fixed points for profinite Galois extensions

Our first extended application of the tools developed in the Introduction is to the theory of profinite Galois extensions; for background on these extensions, we refer the reader to [\cite=joint] and [\cite=Rognes].

We begin by establishing some notation. As in [\cite=joint], suppose that Lk( - ), Bousfield localization with respect to the spectrum k, satisfies the equivalence

[formula]

where M is a finite spectrum and T is smashing. Also, suppose that A is a cofibrant commutative symmetric ring spectrum that is k-local. Finally, given a profinite group H, let ( - )hkH denote the right derived functor of the fixed points ( - )H, with respect to the k-local model structure on discrete H-spectra (see [\cite=joint]): given a discrete H-spectrum Y,

[formula]

where Y  →  YfkH is a natural trivial cofibration, with YfkH fibrant, in the k-local model structure on discrete H-spectra (henceforth, we will say that YfkH is a "k-locally fibrant discrete H-spectrum").

As in [\cite=joint], we let E be a consistent profaithful k-local profinite G-Galois extension of A of finite vcd and we recall that by [\cite=joint], E is a discrete G-spectrum. Also, we let K be any closed normal subgroup of G. By [\cite=joint], (EfkG)K is k-locally fibrant as a discrete (G / K)-spectrum, and hence, since the (G / K)-equivariant map

[formula]

is a k-local equivalence between k-locally fibrant discrete (G / K)-spectra, the induced map λG / K, which has the form

[formula]

is a k-local equivalence. By [\cite=joint], the source EhkG and target ((EfkG)K)hkG / K of λG / K are k-local spectra. Therefore,

[formula]

is a weak equivalence of spectra.

Notice that there is a zigzag of k-local equivalences

[formula]

of discrete K-spectra. Then taking the K-fixed points of zigzag ([\ref=prezigzag]) gives the zigzag

[formula]

where the second map is a weak equivalence of spectra, since it is the K-fixed points of a k-local equivalence between k-locally fibrant discrete K-spectra, and the first map is a k-local equivalence, due to the combination of the last conclusion (about the second map) and the end of [\cite=joint].

In the k-local model structure on discrete (G / K)-spectra, the weak equivalences are those morphisms that are k-local equivalences, and hence, though [formula] and (EfkK)K do not necessarily carry (pertinent, nontrivial) (G / K)-actions, zigzag ([\ref=zigzag]) makes it reasonable - in the k-local setting - to identify the discrete (G / K)-spectrum (EfkG)K with EhkK, so that equivalence ([\ref=pregalois]) can be interpreted as the equivalence

[formula]

Equivalence ([\ref=galois]) says that given a sufficiently nice profinite Galois extension E, the iterated k-local homotopy fixed point spectrum (EhkK)hkG / K can be formed, and it behaves in a natural way, in that it is equivalent to EhkG and thereby mimics the fixed point identity

[formula]

Though equivalence ([\ref=galois]) is a step forward in the theory of profinite Galois extensions, we would like to have such a result about iterated homotopy fixed points that avoids the k-local setting that is used in ([\ref=galois]). This is not an easy thing to achieve: as explained in detail in [\cite=iterated] and [\cite=joint], there are subtleties with (non-local) iterated homotopy fixed points that, in general, make even forming the iterated homotopy fixed point spectrum a difficult task. However, with E as above, we are able to show that LM(E) is the homotopy limit of a continuous G-spectrum, so that one can form (LM(E))hK, and this last spectrum is the homotopy limit of a continuous (G / K)-spectrum, so that one can form the iterated homotopy fixed point spectrum [formula]. Additionally, we obtain the following result.

The above theorem shows that, as desired, a sufficiently nice profinite Galois extension does indeed satisfy a non-local version of equivalence ([\ref=galois]), when the quotient group G / K has finite vcd. The proof of Theorem [\ref=iterated] and the justification for the two conclusions that immediately precede it are placed at the end of this paper, in Section [\ref=extension].

In the following two examples, we describe some situations in which the cohomological conditions on G and G / K in Theorem [\ref=iterated] are satisfied.

A comparison of spectral sequences

In this section, we give another application of Theorem [\ref=maintool]. We will be referring to En, Gn, the tower {Mi}i, and Fn, as defined in the Introduction. We note that given a spectrum X, we always use [formula] to refer to the graded abelian group of maps in the stable homotopy category from sphere spectra to X.

Now, let K be any closed subgroup of Gn. In the Introduction, we mentioned that the commutative S-algebra EdhKn behaves like a K-homotopy fixed point spectrum. As an example of this behavior, by [\cite=DH], for any spectrum Z with trivial K-action, where [formula] (as in equivalence ([\ref=hocolim]); recall that each Zβ is a finite spectrum), there is a strongly convergent [formula]-local En-Adams spectral sequence

[formula]

where

[formula]

with K acting trivially on each Mi and DZβ. We note that, since Gn is a compact p-adic analytic group, it follows that K is also, by [\cite=dixon], and hence, since each abelian group [formula] is a finite discrete [formula]-module, [formula] is a finite abelian group, by [\cite=Symonds].

By [\cite=DH] (see [\cite=cts] for an explicit proof), there is an equivalence

[formula]

for each i. Thus,

[formula]

where [formula] is a continuous K-spectrum, and, since

[formula]

by [\cite=joint], where

[formula]

we have

[formula]

where F(Z,En)hK is defined as in Definition [\ref=defone] and the last isomorphism above is due to Theorem [\ref=maintool] and the fact that K has finite vcd (since Gn has finite vcd). The observations in the preceding sentence suggest that spectral sequence ([\ref=s.s.]) ought to be isomorphic to a descent spectral sequence that has the form the following theorem shows that this suggestion is, in fact, correct.

Our first step is to show that the descent spectral sequence exists. Given a profinite group H and a discrete abelian group A, we let [formula] denote the abelian group of continuous functions H  →  A. Then

[formula]

for all s  >  0, all m  ≥  0, and all [formula] (this follows from [\cite=DH], since the "Gn" that is in [\cite=DH] can be changed to any profinite group, without affecting the validity of the argument), and therefore, by [\cite=joint], there is a homotopy spectral sequence that has the form

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the continuous cohomology of continuous cochains, with coefficients in the profinite [formula]-module πt(F(Z,En)). By [\cite=DH], there is an isomorphism

[formula]

so that the above homotopy spectral sequence is the desired descent spectral sequence.

Spectral sequence ([\ref=strongss]) is the inverse limit [formula] of [formula]-local En-Adams spectral sequences [formula] that have the form Similarly, spectral sequence ([\ref=dss]) is the inverse limit [formula] of descent spectral sequences [formula] that have the form

[formula]

where the abutment of spectral sequence [formula] is identified by using the equivalence F(Z,EhKn)≃F(Z,En)hK. By [\cite=joint], for each β and i, there is an isomorphism

[formula]

of spectral sequences from the E2-terms onward, completing the proof of the theorem.

The proof of Theorem [\ref=iterated]

In this section, we use the notation that was established in Section [\ref=sectiontwo].

Since M is a finite spectrum, [\cite=Bousfieldlocal] implies that, for any spectrum Y,

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the [formula]-colocalization of the sphere spectrum S0. Then, as in the Introduction, by writing

[formula]

where the right-hand side is a homotopy colimit of a directed system {Wβ}β of finite spectra, we obtain that

[formula]

Now let G be any profinite group (we are not assuming that G has finite vcd), let X be a discrete G-spectrum, and give [formula] and each DWβ trivial G-action. Then [formula] is a continuous G-spectrum and

[formula]

These conclusions motivate the following definition.

If G is any profinite group and X is a discrete G-spectrum, then it is natural to identify LM(X) with [formula], and hence, we define

[formula]

so that, by Definition [\ref=defone],

[formula]

We are now ready to prove Theorem [\ref=iterated]: we suppose that E is a consistent profaithful k-local profinite G-Galois extension of A that has finite vcd. Recall that E is a discrete G-spectrum, so that by Definition [\ref=deftwo], for any closed subgroup H of G,

[formula]

Since G has finite vcd, K does too, and hence, Theorem [\ref=maintool] implies that

[formula]

For the next step in our argument, we make a few recollections from [\cite=joint]. Given any profinite group P, let

[formula]

Then [formula] is a coaugmented comonad on the category of spectra and we let [formula] be the associated cosimplicial spectrum (obtained through the comonadic cobar construction), which, in codegree k, satisfies the isomorphism

[formula]

By [\cite=joint],

[formula]

By [\cite=joint], E is T-local, and hence, by [\cite=joint], the cosimplicial spectrum [formula] is T-local in each codegree. Thus, the homotopy limit [formula] is T-local, implying that EhK is also T-local, so that

[formula]

By [\cite=joint], there is an equivalence

[formula]

where E  →  EfG is a trivial cofibration, with EfG fibrant, in the model category [formula]. Therefore, putting ([\ref=uselater]) and ([\ref=moreuselater]) together yields

[formula]

Notice that

[formula]

By the proof of [\cite=joint], (EfG)U≃EhU. The argument above that showed that EhK is T-local also shows that each EhU, and hence, each (EfG)U, is T-local. Since T is smashing, the filtered colimit [formula] is T-local, implying that (EfG)K is too. We conclude that

[formula]

and we note that (EfG)K is a discrete (G / K)-spectrum. Therefore, thanks to ([\ref=lastlabel]), we identify (LM(E))hK with LM((EfG)K), and hence,

[formula]

Thus, by Definition [\ref=deftwo], we have

[formula]

Now suppose that G / K has finite vcd. Then the proof of Theorem [\ref=iterated] is completed by the equivalences

[formula]

where the first equivalence is due to Theorem [\ref=maintool], the second equivalence follows from [\cite=joint], and the third equivalence comes from another application of Theorem [\ref=maintool].
