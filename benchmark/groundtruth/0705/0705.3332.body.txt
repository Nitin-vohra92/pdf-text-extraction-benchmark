High Resolution Spectroscopy of 12~  ΛB by Electroproduction

Hypernuclei, long-lived baryonic systems with strangeness ≠  0, provide us with a variety of nuclear phenomena. For example, a Λ hyperon (baryon with strangeness [formula] and mean lifetime τ  ~  10- 10 s) can be placed deep inside the nucleus as an impurity providing a sensitive probe of the nuclear interior. The Λ couples weakly to nuclear core states and the VNΛ residual interaction removes the degeneracy of the multiplets. In the case of a Λ in an s orbit, the resulting doublet is split by the spin-dependent components of the interaction. The doublet spacings range from a few up to several hundred keV. Since very limited information can be obtained from elementary hyperon-nucleon scattering, hypernuclei are unique laboratories for studying the ΛN interaction.

In the past, hypernuclear spectroscopy has been carried out with limited resolution by means of hadronic reactions, such as the strangeness-exchange AZ(K-,π-)AΛZ and associated-production AZ(π+,K+)AΛZ reactions. More recently, γ-ray spectroscopy has been used to measure hypernuclear transition energies. Here, the few-keV energy resolution has allowed precise level assignments and the measurement of doublet spacings [\cite=hashtam] but the method is limited to the bound region below particle emission thresholds and to bound levels reached following particle emission.

The experimental knowledge can be enhanced using electroproduction of strangeness that is characterized by a large 3-momentum transfer to the hypernucleus ([formula] 250 MeV/c), a large angular momentum transfer ΔJ, and strong spin-flip terms, even at zero kaon production angle. Moreover, the K+Λ pair production occurs on a proton in contrast to a neutron in (K-,π-) or (π+,K+) reactions making possible the study of different hypernuclei and charge-dependent effects from a comparison of mirror hypernuclei.

The E94-107 experiment in Hall A at Jefferson Lab [\cite=proposal] (JLab) started a systematic study of high-resolution hypernuclear spectroscopy on p-shell targets, specifically 9Be, 12C, and 16O. The results on 12C are presented in this paper.

12C targets have been extensively used in hypernuclear studies with the (K-,π-), (π+,K+) and [formula] reactions that are dominated by non-spin-flip contributions. In the early experiments, only two peaks, attributed to the Λ in s or p orbits coupled to the 11C ground state, were evident [\cite=hashtam]. The first evidence of structure between the main peaks came from (π+,K+) studies with the SKS spectrometer at KEK (E140a, E336, and E369) [\cite=hashtam], with the best resolution of 1.45 MeV in KEK E369 [\cite=KEK369]. Recently, in the stopped K- experiment of the FINUDA collaboration [\cite=FINUDA], further evidence for structure in this region has been observed. The first electroproduction experiment [\cite=Miyoshi] performed on a 12C target at JLab in Hall C had limited statistics but proved that the electroproduction process can be used to study hypernuclear spectra with sub-MeV energy resolution and measured cross sections.

Hall A at JLab is well suited to perform (e,e'K+) experiments. Scattered electrons can be detected in the High Resolution Spectrometer (HRS) electron arm while coincident kaons are detected in the HRS hadron arm [\cite=nimhalla]. The disadvantage of smaller electromagnetic cross sections is partially compensated for by the high current, high duty cycle, and high energy resolution capabilities of the beam at Jefferson Lab. In the present experiment, a 100 mg/cm2 12C target was used with an electron beam current of 100 μA.

The strong inverse dependence of the cross section on Q2, squared virtual photon 4-momentum transfer, calls for measurements at low Q2. To maximize the cross section, the electron scattering angle must be minimized, subject to avoiding the increasing background from processes at very forward electron angles. To minimize the momentum transferred to the hypernucleus, and maximize the cross section, a detection angle θK for the K+ must be chosen near the virtual photon direction. The high beam energy results in a relatively high momentum for the kaon, as required to keep a reasonable survival fraction in the spectrometer (25 m flight path). So, kinematics were set to particle detection at [formula] for both electrons and kaons, incident beam energy of 3.77 GeV, scattered electron momentum of 1.56 GeV/c, and kaon momentum of 1.96 GeV/c.

In order to allow experiments at forward angles smaller than the HRS's minimum angle (12.5[formula]), a superconducting septum magnet was added to each HRS. Particles at scattering angles of [formula] are deflected by the septum magnets into the HRS. This new spectrometer configuration (Septum + HRS) provides a general purpose device that extends the HRS features to small scattering angles while preserving the spectrometer optical performance [\cite=septum]. The energy resolution depends on the momentum resolution of the HRS spectrometers, on the straggling and energy loss in the target, and on the beam energy spread. A momentum resolution of the system (HRS's + septum magnets) of Δp  /  p  =  10- 4 (FWHM) and a beam energy spread as small as 6  ×  10- 5 (FWHM) are necessary to be able to achieve an excitation-energy resolution of about 500 keV. With a dedicated effort the Accelerator staff were able to address the beam quality requirements and to set up new devices for continuous beam energy spread monitoring.

The high background level demands a very efficient PID system with unambiguous kaon identification. The standard PID system in the hadron arm is composed of two aerogel threshold Cherenkov counters [\cite=lagamba] [\cite=nimhalla] (n1  =  1.015, n2  =  1.055). Charged pions (protons) with momenta around 2 GeV/c are above (below) the Cherenkov light emission threshold. Kaons emit Cherenkov light only in the n2  =  1.055 detector. Hence, a combination of the signals from the two counters should distinguish among the three species of hadrons. However, due to inefficiencies and delta-ray production, the identification of kaons has contamination from pions and protons. This has driven the design, construction, and installation of a Ring Imaging CHerenkov (RICH) detector, conceptually identical to the ALICE HMPID design [\cite=AliceRichTDR], in the hadron HRS detector package. It uses a proximity focusing geometry, a CsI photocathode, and a 15 mm thick liquid perfluorohexane radiator. A detailed description of the layout and the performance of the RICH detector is given in [\cite=rich2004] [\cite=pylosfg] [\cite=pylosfc]. In the electron arm, the Gas Cherenkov counters give pion rejection ratios up to 103. The remaining backgound (due to knock-on electrons) is reduced by a further 2 orders of magnitude by the lead glass pre-shower and shower counters, giving a total pion rejection ratio of 105.

The essential role of the RICH in identifying kaons is shown in Fig. [\ref=ctkaon], where the unfilled, without RICH, should be compared to the filled spectrum, with RICH. All contributions from pions and protons completely vanish with the RICH.

In Fig. [\ref=carbon1], the excitation energy spectrum of 12~  ΛB is shown for the full range of energy acceptance. The filled histogram shows the low level of [formula] random coincidence background. Figure [\ref=carbon2] shows the six-fold differential cross section expressed in nb/(sr2 GeV MeV). The background has been evaluated by fitting the data obtained for random coincidences in a large timing window. No residual background in the negative range of Ex is present after subtraction. The origin of the excitation energy scale has been set to the peak value of the ground-state (g.s.) level (the uncertainty of the absolute scale being about 0.5 MeV).

The first step in fitting the data was to use a peak search algorithm [\cite=peaksearch] to identify six regions with an excess of counts above background at the 90% confidence level. When fitted with Gaussian functions, individual peaks show non-gaussian contributions, mainly in the tails due to the radiative effects. Voigt functions [\cite=voigt], convolutions of gaussian with Lorentzian functions, are often used in spectroscopy to better fit the data. The main idea in fitting the data is to minimize the number of assumptions. Since each peak might contain a more complex (unresolved) structure, each Voigt function allows the width, location and height to vary independently. The best fit is thus determined by minimizing χ2/n.d.f. with respect to the positions, widths, and amplitudes of 6 Voigt functions and parameters of the quasi-free region modeled by a quadratic form. The results of the parameters obtained in the fit with χ2/n.d.f.=1.16, together with the statistical significance of the assigned levels (in terms of [formula]) and cross sections, as obtained after a radiative unfolding procedure, are given in Table [\ref=table].

The narrowest width of 670  ±  150 keV has been measured for the peak at Ex = 10.93 MeV, indicating that the experimental excitation energy resolution is at least compatible with this value.

On the other hand, the width for the g.s. peak, around Ex  =  0.0 MeV, is 1150  ±  180 keV, wider than 670 keV, although, within errors, not in sharp statistical disagreement.

Such a larger width might suggest a more complex structure underlying the g.s. peak. The possibility of an unresolved doublet has been explored by fitting with two Voigt functions, constraining their widths to be the same as the peak at Ex = 10.93 MeV. The result is that the separation between the two Voigt shapes is about 650 keV, larger than the 140 keV predicted by the theory. However, with the present sample of data, there is not enough statistical significance to favor such a result over a simple statistical fluctuation of the widths. This situation could be clarified either with a larger sample of data or by an improvement in the experimental resolution.

Due to the very low level of background, states with an sΛ coupled to excited 11B core states are clearly observed between the g.s. and the level at 10.93 MeV with signal to noise ratios (SNR) larger than 5. The positions of these levels can be determined with uncertainties less than 150 keV. Cross sections are determined at the level of 15-20%.

In Fig. [\ref=carbon2], the measured electroproduction cross sections for hypernuclear states are also compared with a model (dashed line), which shows very good overall agreement with the data without any normalization factor. The theoretical cross sections were obtained in the framework of the Distorted Wave Impulse Approximation (DWIA) [\cite=modMS] using the Saclay-Lyon (SLA) model [\cite=SLA] for the elementary p(e,e'K+)Λ reaction. Shell-model wave functions for 11B and 12~  ΛB were obtained using fitted p-shell interactions and a parametrization of the ΛN interaction that fits the precise γ-ray spectra of 7ΛLi [\cite=modJM]. The results are compared with experiment in Table [\ref=table].

The large g.s. peak and another strong peak at ~   10.93 MeV correspond to the substitution of a p-shell proton by a Λ in s and p states, respectively, coupled dominantly to the 3 / 2- g.s. of 11B. Two peaks at Ex  =  2.65 MeV and Ex  =  5.92 MeV are also evident. Theoretically (see Table [\ref=table]), they should be due to the 1- member of the 0-,  1- doublet based on the 1 / 2- state of 11B at Ex = 2.125 MeV and to the 1-,  2- doublet based on the 3 / 2- level of 11B at Ex  =  5.020 MeV, with the dominant contribution coming from the 2- state. The raising of the doublet energies relative to the unperturbed core energies is mainly due to the [formula] component of the effective ΛN interaction [\cite=millhyp00]. The energies and cross sections for the three sΛ peaks are well reproduced by the theoretical predictions for the five sΛ states.

Because the Λ spin-orbit interaction is weak, the calculation predicts essentially degenerate 2+ and 3+ states from 11B[formula] coupling. Table [\ref=table] shows that these two states dominate in the main peak observed close to 11 MeV. There is clearly strength on either side of this peak, accounted for in the fit by peaks at 9.54 MeV (though at the limit of statistical significance) and at 12.36 MeV. The theoretical pΛ strength based on the ground and first-excited states of 11B accounts for 98% of the observed strength. There are six known positive-parity states between 9 and 12 MeV in 11B [\cite=ajzenberg] to which an sΛ can couple to form 2+ or 3+ hypernuclear states. Based on existing (e,e'p) data, these states are expected to be only weakly excited and an admixture with the nearby pΛ states is required for them to be excited as strongly as observed in the present data. From their shell-model structure, the 9.88 MeV 3 / 2+ and 11.60 MeV 5 / 2+ states of 11B should be the most important but a full 1hω shell-model calculation is needed to investigate this problem.

In summary, a high-quality, background-free 12~  ΛB hypernuclear spectrum with unprecedented energy resolution (~  670 keV) has been obtained. The new experimental devices have proven to be very effective. In particular, septum magnets had no adverse affect on the HRS optics and the RICH played an essential role in the unambiguous identification of kaons.

The measured cross section for the g.s. doublet is in very good agreement with the value of 4.68 nb/sr2/GeV predicted using the SLA model. The sΛ part of the spectrum is well reproduced by the theory and a very good agreement is also obtained for the other levels. For the first time a measurable strength with good energy resolution has been observed in the core-excited part of the spectrum. This is helped by the fact that the spin-spin interaction enhances these states with respect to the weak-coupling limit. The distribution of strength within several MeV on either side of the strong pΛ peak should stimulate theoretical work to better understand the pΛ region.
