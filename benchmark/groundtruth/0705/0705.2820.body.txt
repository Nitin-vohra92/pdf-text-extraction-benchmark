Entropy Oriented Trading: A Trading Strategy Based on the Second Law of Thermodynamics

Definition of the Strategy

An Entropy Oriented Trading strategy has n target types of asset [formula]. It has constant weights for the assets ([formula]), where the weights are positive and the sum of them is one. The price and the held amount of the ith asset are written as pi and hi respectively. The value of the ith asset is

[formula]

The total value of assets is

[formula]

The prices pi change according to time. On a point of time, a strategy can trade assets Ai and Aj. It can change the held amounts (hi,hj) to (hi',hj') only if the total asset is not changed. We define the traded amount of value Qij  =  pihi'  -  pihi and express the trade condition

[formula]

Multiple trades may occur at the same time. In that case, the sum [formula] is the value of the bought amount of the asset Ai. The value of Qi is negative if asset Ai is sold.

An Entropy Oriented Trading strategy tries to keep the distribution of asset equal to the weights, so in equilibrium, the equation ([\ref=state]) hold:

[formula]

When the price change is slow enough (or the strategy trades frequently enough), the equation ([\ref=state]) holds. Otherwise, Ti  =  Ui  /  wi can be different from T. In this case, the strategy trades to make all Ti's equal.

We can assume that when Ti  >  Tj, an Entropy Oriented Trading strategy does not trade selling Aj and buying Ai. This means

[formula]

A trade involving Ai and Aj is reversible only if Ti  =  Tj.

Analysis of the Strategy

To analyse this strategy with thermodynamics, we have to choose the state variables and the equation of state. The state variables are pi,hi,Ti and the equation of state is

[formula]

and we take the internal energy as Ui  =  wiTi. Note that the T-based trading restriction ([\ref=second]) is analogous to the second law of thermodynamics.

We first analyse the case in which the equation ([\ref=state]) always holds and then analyse the more general case. In both cases, we assume that we can consider a transformation of system as a continuous sequence of infinitesimal transformations.

On Reversible Transformations

When the equation ([\ref=state]) always holds, Ti  =  Tj holds for any i and j, so that all trades are reversible. The equation of state becomes

[formula]

Taking the differential of ([\ref=eos_reversible]), we have

[formula]

The amount [formula] is the change of Ui due to the trades occurring at the given point of time, whereas the amount [formula] is the change of the value of Ui due to the price change.

Integrating this from the state C to the state D yields:

[formula]

Now we take the summation for i. For simplicity, we introduce weighted geometric average of prices [formula]. Since the trade condition ([\ref=trade]) states [formula], we can omit the term [formula] and get

[formula]

stating that the rate of investment is equal to the price change rate.

We take an arbitary equilibrium state O and define the entropy Si(C) as

[formula]

where the integral is taken along a reversible transformation. We also define the total entropy [formula] Note that the total entropy S is constant in reversible transformations.

On Irreversible Transformations

In irreversible transformations, the amount Ti can be different for different i because of delay of trades. Taking the differential of the equation of state ([\ref=eos]) yields [formula]. Dividing this by T and taking the integral from a state C to another state D, we get

[formula]

We assume that the states C and D are in equilibrium so that for any i Ti(C)  =  T(C) and Ti(D)  =  T(D). We take summation for i and see

[formula]

The trading restriction ([\ref=second]) means Qij / Ti  +  Qji / Tj  ≥  0. From this we can obtain ΔS  =  S(D)  -  S(C)  ≥  0. Especially, when a irreversible trade occurs between Ai and Aj, the entropy increases by Qij  /  Ti  +  Qji  /  Tj  >  0.

The equation ([\ref=fin]) states that the return of investment is the product of the rate of price change and exp (ΔS), which is equal to or more than one:
