Prüfer's Ideal Numbers as Gelfand's maximal Ideals

Prolegomena

Let us start from an elementary polynomial identity. Let {pj} be an arbitrary sequence of natural numbers and z be a complex variable. It is easily seen that for each [formula]

[formula]

[formula]

In particular, if the sequence pj is constant, i.e. pj = p for all j, the identity will be transformed to the form showing that each non-negative integer n < pk can be uniquely represented by the sum

[formula]

where the digits νr(n) satisfy the following condition: 0  ≤  νr(n) < p.

If we set pj = j then [formula] and the identity has the form

[formula]

which shows that each non-negative integer n < k! admits the unique factorial representation

[formula]

where the digits νr(n) satisfy the condition 0  ≤  νr(n)  ≤  r.

Trying to give a general meaning to formulae of the type ([\ref=p-adic]) and ([\ref=factorial]) with an infinite number of digits caused H. Prüfer [\cite=Pruefer] to create a new theory of ideal numbers. J. von Neumann [\cite=Neumann] further developed this theory which was later completed in the theory of adeles ([\cite=Gelf-and]).

The representation ([\ref=p-adic]) of ideal numbers with the prime p as the radix and an infinite number of digits (invented by K. Hensel [\cite=Hensel]) gave rise to the p-adic analysis (for references see e.g. [\cite=Robert]).

The factorial representation ([\ref=factorial]) with an infinite number of digits lays at the foundation of the polyadic analysis. M. D. Van Dantzig [\cite=VanDantzig] and later E. Novoselov [\cite=Nov-66] gave an essential contribution to this area. The most significant results were summarized by E. Novoselov in his book [\cite=Nov-82].

By a polyadic number E. Novoselov means a finite integral adele. Such a number can be viewed as a limit of an integer sequence which converges p-adically for every prime p. The Novoselov's theory includes the polyadic topology, arithmetics, the basic analytic functions, measure theory and integration in the polyadic domain.

J.-L. Mauclaire well adapted and completed this theory in a number of papers [\cite=Mauclaire-81] [\cite=Mauclaire-85] [\cite=Mauclaire-86] [\cite=Mauclaire-88].

The most important property of the polyadic topological ring [formula] with the divisibility topology [formula] is to be a compact Hausdorff space. As is well known, there is no translation-invariant σ-additive measure on [formula]. But such a measure (Haar measure) exists on the compact additive group of the polyadic ring [formula] including [formula] as dense subset. So, the compactification of the ring [formula] is the key idea of the Novoselov theory. His method for the investigation of the distribution problems of arithmetic functions has been studied by several papers and books, such as  [\cite=Knopfmacher] [\cite=Krizhyus] [\cite=Schwarz] [\cite=Kubota] [\cite=Sugita].

Of course, various ways of compactification are possible. They lead us to different (a priori) completions of [formula].

Z. Krizhyus [\cite=Krizhyus] deals with the compactification based on periodicity, which seems very natural. Indeed, on the one hand, the sum (or the product) of m- and n-periodic functions on [formula] has each common multiple of m and n as period. On the other hand, if a function f is m- and n-periodic simultaneously then any common divisor of m and n is also a period of f. As divisibility is a main notion of arithmetics, the algebra [formula] of all periodic function on [formula] must play an important role in number theory.

In fact, there are many known works (cf. [\cite=DeBruijn] [\cite=Delsarte] [\cite=Knopfmacher] [\cite=Daboussi] [\cite=Schwarz] [\cite=Kubota] [\cite=Sugita]) concerned with the almost periodic functions which are elements of closures [formula] with respect to various norms. In [\cite=Krizhyus] the uniform completion A of the algebra [formula] is considered. By the theory of commutative Banach algebras presented, e. g., in [\cite=Gelfand], A is isometrically isomorphic to the algebra of all continuous functions on the Gelfand A-compactification [formula] of [formula].

The plan of this article is as follows. In the sections 1-3 we introduce the basic concepts and notations used in the paper. Then, in the section 4 we define the ring operations in [formula]. Further, in the section 5 we define a cluster topology in the ring [formula] and we prove that it is identical with the Gelfand topology [formula]. Next, in the sections 6-7 the polyadic topological ring [formula] is described. This exposition differs from Novoselov's one merely in non-essential technical details. The contents of the section 8 can be regarded as a presentation of some "bridge" between the topological rings [formula] and [formula]. At last, in the section 9 we state the identity of these topological rings.

Preliminaries

Weak topologies in the dual space

Let B0 be a dense subspace of a Banach space B. For any ψ∈B*, u∈B0 and R > 0 we define a neighborhood UR(u;ψ) of the element ψ:

[formula]

These neighborhoods form a subbase of some topology in B* called B0-topology. If B0 = B then it is called the *  -weak topology in B*.

All topologies induced by different B0-topologies on a bounded subset [formula] coincide.

Let us check that a topology [formula] induced on [formula] by an arbitrary B0-topology coincides with the topology [formula] induced on this set by the *  -weak topology of the space B*. Since it is obvious (from the definition of the B0-topology) that   ⊆  , it is necessary to show that   ⊆  . It will suffice to prove that for each functional [formula] an arbitrary element UR(u;ψ) of the [formula]-subbase is wider than some element Ur(v;ψ) from the [formula]-subbase. Let the norms of functionals from [formula] be bounded by N. Let us choose an element v of the set B0 (dense in B) and a positive number r such that the following inequalities

[formula]

hold. Under this condition Ur(v;ψ)  ⊆  UR(u;ψ). Indeed, for any functional φ from Ur(v;ψ) we have

[formula]

i. e. every functional φ from Ur(v;ψ) belongs to UR(u;ψ).

Topological ring

A subset U of a commutative ring R is called symmetric if with each element a∈U it contains its opposite ( - a). In order to define in R a Hausdorff topology compatible with the algebraic structure of R, it is convenient to set a base of neighborhoods of zero that is a class [formula] of symmetric subsets complying with the following conditions:

The zero of the ring R is a unique common element of all neighborhoods.

An intersection of two arbitrary neighborhoods of zero includes some neighborhood of zero.

For each neighborhood of zero V it is possible to find a neighborhood of zero U such that   {u1 + u2:u1,u2∈U}  ⊆  V.

For each neighborhood of zero V and arbitrary element a∈R it is possible to show a neighborhood U such that {au:u∈U}  ⊆  V.

For an arbitrary neighborhood of zero V it is possible to specify a neighborhood of zero U such that   {u1u2:u1,u2∈U}  ⊆  V.

The translations Ua  =  {a + u:u∈U} of neighborhoods of zero form a base [formula] of neighborhoods of an arbitrary point a:

[formula]

An empty set and any subset S  ⊆  R including some neighborhood Ua of each its point a are announced as open in the topology of the ring R. Obviously, by this definition, a union of open sets and an intersection of two open sets are open.

The interior Woa of a neighborhood Wa consists of points U having a neighborhood of zero V such that Vu  ⊆  Wa.

The interior Woa is not empty, because it contains the point a.

The set Woa is the largest open part of Wa.

Let u∈Woa and let V be a neighborhood of zero for which Vu  ⊆  Wa. Let U be a neighborhood of zero found according to ([\ref=U+U]). Let us check that Uu  ⊆  Woa and thus establish that Woa is open.

The neighborhood Uv of an arbitrary point v∈Uu consists of points u + u1 + u2 where u1, u2 belong to the neighborhood U. By virtue of ([\ref=U+U]), u1 + u2∈V, so that Uv  ⊆  Vu  ⊆  Wa. Hence, the arbitrary point v of the neighborhood Uu belongs to Woa, as was to be checked.

Let now S be a nonempty open subset of a neighborhood Wa. Each point u belongs to S together with some neighborhood Vu. All the more, u belongs to Wa together with Vu, i. e. u∈Woa.

Let topologies [formula] and [formula] in R be defined by two bases of neighborhoods [formula] and [formula], respectively. The topology [formula] is weaker than the topology [formula] if and only if each neighborhood [formula] includes some neighborhood [formula].

Let [formula] be weaker than [formula], i. e. every [formula]-open set is [formula]-open. The interior Uo of the neighborhood U contains the zero of the ring R and it is [formula]-open. A fortiori it is [formula]-open, so that zero is included into it with some [formula]-neighborhood V. Thus, V  ⊆  Uo  ⊆  U.

Conversely, each point s of the [formula]-open set S belongs to it with a neighborhood Us which is a translation of a neighborhood of zero U. The neighborhood U contains some neighborhood [formula]. Since the above translation keeps the inclusion of sets Vs  ⊆  Us  ⊆  S, the point s of S belongs to S with a [formula]-neighborhood Vs. Hence this set is [formula]-open.

Almost periodic functions on [formula]

Algebra A of almost periodic functions

Denote by [formula] the class of all complex-valued periodic functions u on [formula]. This is a commutative algebra with the unit e, termwise operations and a complex conjugation u  ↦  u *  as involution. The class [formula] consisting of all p-periodic complex-valued functions on [formula] is a finite-dimensional subalgebra in [formula]. Let p and q be arbitrary positive integers. Any q-periodic function is also a pq-periodic one. Hence [formula] can be considered as an inductive limit of the increasing sequence of algebras

[formula]

A periodic function u on [formula] takes only a finite number of values, hence one can define on [formula] a uniform norm [formula] having the following properties: [formula]. By completion of [formula] we get the Banach algebra A of almost periodic functions on [formula].

Subalgebra of p-periodic functions

Denote by [formula] a residuum under division [formula] by [formula] defined by the equality [formula]   (0  ≤  n - mp < p). We define a raster Rp(m) as the set of level m of the function [formula]:

The indicators epm (0  ≤  m < p) of the rasters Rp(m) have the following properties:

epmepn  =  δmnepm;

[formula];

[formula] for any u from [formula];

the functions epm form a base in [formula].

(1) The product of indicators is the indicator of the intersection, but the sets of different levels do not intersect, therefore if m  ≠  n then epmepn = 0. Moreover by definition any indicator coincides with its square.

(2) The rasters Rp(m) (as sets of all different levels) split [formula] into components. But in case of partition, the indicator e of a union is equal to the sum of the component indicators epm.

(3) On the raster Rp(m) the product (u - u(m)e)  epm is equal to zero because of the first factor, on its completion it is equal to zero because of the second one. Therefore uepm = u(m)epm and hence, in view of equality (2),

[formula]

(4) The condition epm(k) = 1 is equivalent to

[formula]

The latter equality means that (k + p)∈Rp(m). Thus, epm(k + p) = 1, and the p-periodicity of the indicator epm is established. Let us check the independence of the elements epm whose completeness was proved in the previous item. Multiplying both parts of the equality [formula] by epn we get, in view of the item (1), the equality αnepn = 0 which is possible only if αn = 0.

The subalgebra [formula] separates the points of the set

[formula]

Let 0  ≤  m < p, then epm(k) = 1 for k = m, therefore epm(k) = 0 for all other values k∈K.

Characters of the Banach algebra A

General information

We call by character any non-zero multiplicative linear functional [formula] . Such a functional is always bounded and its norm is equal to 1. Denote the set of all characters by [formula]. A non-trivial ideal of the algebra A is called maximal if it is not a subset of any other non-trivial ideal. The kernel of a character is a maximal ideal and conversely: any maximal ideal is the kernel of a unique character.

For each element u∈A we define a function [formula] by the formula û(ψ) = ψ(u). The topology [formula] induced on [formula] by the *  -weak topology of the dual A* is called Gelfand topology. It is the weakest topology for which all functions û are continuous. Since the subalgebra [formula] is dense in A and [formula] is a subset of the unit sphere by virtue of Proposition [\ref=subbasis], it is possible to define the topology [formula] by such a subbase of neighborhoods of points [formula]:

[formula]

Owing to classical inferences of the general Gelfand theory, the topological space [formula] is a compact Hausdorff one and the transform G:u  ↦  û is an isometry of the algebra A onto the algebra of all continuous complex-valued functions [formula] with a uniform norm.

In view of the density of [formula] in the Banach algebra A both algebras have the same dual and the same set of characters. Thus it is sufficient to describe only the characters of the algebra [formula].

Restriction of character on the subalgebra [formula]

For all [formula] we define a functional k by the equality k(u) = u(k). Its linearity and multiplicativity are obvious, while its non-triviality follows from the equality ωk(e) = e(k) = 1.

Denote by ψp the restriction [formula] of a character ψ on the subalgebra [formula]. As the following proposition shows, the set of non-zero restrictions ψp consists only of the functionals k.

For each [formula] and [formula] either the restriction ψp is trivial or there is a unique non-negative number k = (p;ψ) < p such that ψp  =  k.

For a character ψ with a non-zero restriction ψp there is an element u in the subalgebra [formula] such that [formula]. Dividing by ψ(u) both members of the equality ψ(u) = ψ(eu) = ψ(e)ψ(u) we conclude that ψ(e) = 1. Further, it follows from the item (1) of Proposition [\ref=indicators] that ψ2(epk) = ψ(epk), i .e. for each value of the index k either ψ(epk) = 0, or ψ(epk) = 1. We find by calculating the value of ψ on each side of the equality (2) from Proposition [\ref=indicators] that [formula]. This is only possible if exactly one of the addends differs from zero. So, for the considered character ψ the set {k:0  ≤  k < p} contains a unique k such that the equality ψ(epm) = δkm holds for any m. Let us compute the value of the functional ψ on an arbitrary function [formula] using the equality (3) from Proposition [\ref=indicators]:

[formula]

Assume now that ψ  =  r where 0  ≤  r < p. Then u(k) = u(r) for every p-periodic function u. In particular, for [formula] we have r = u(r) = u(k) = k.

Let us underline an important property of the function [formula].

If the restrictions of a character ψ to the subalgebras [formula] and [formula] are non-trivial, then

[formula]

where [formula] is the greatest common divisor of m and n.

Set [formula]. As the function [formula] belongs to both [formula] and [formula], we have

[formula]

[formula]

as was to be proved.

The ring of characters

Convolutions and reflection in [formula]

Denote by [formula] the algebra consisting of all periodic (with respect to both arguments) functions [formula] such that w(x,y) = w(y,x). If a function w is p-periodic with respect to x, it will be p-periodic with respect to y as well (and conversely). Indeed, w(x,y + p) = w(y + p,x) = w(y,x) = w(x,y). Let us agree to denote the value φ(u) of a functional φ∈A* by φxu(x). Thus, the variable x twice repeated in this expression is umbral i. e. the letter x can be replaced by any other one. Fixing the value of one of the arguments one can consider the function w as some element of [formula].

Define the direct product [formula] of two functionals φ and ψ by the equality [formula].

This is a linear functional on the algebra [formula].

The direct product is commutative.

Let w be an arbitrary p-periodic function taken from the algebra [formula]. Twice applying the equality (3) from Proposition [\ref=indicators], one can represent this function as

[formula]

Let us apply the linear functionals [formula] and [formula] to both sides of this equality:

[formula]

[formula]

By changing the index names in the second equality and using the symmetry of the function w, we find that

[formula]

Hence, [formula].

We shall define operators s and p from [formula] into [formula] and an operator n from [formula] into [formula]. For any [formula] we set

[formula]

It is clear that these operators are multiplicative:

[formula]

We call the functionals [formula] and, respectively, [formula] a plus- and a dot-convolutions of φ and ψ. The functional [formula] is called a reflection of φ.

Ring properties of the operations in [formula]

Both convolutions in the previous definition are commutative and associative.

The commutativity of operations is an obvious corollary from Proposition [\ref=commut]. The associativity of the dot-convolution follows from the equalities

[formula]

and from the associativity of the multiplication in [formula]. The associativity of the plus-convolution can be established quite similarly .

The functionals θ  =  0 and ε  =  1 are neutral elements of the operations [formula] and [formula] respectively.

[formula]

i. e. θ and ε -- are neutral elements of the corresponding convolutions.

The direct product of characters of the algebra [formula] is a character of the algebra [formula].

For any two functions u and v from the algebra [formula], in view of the multiplicativity of the functionals φ and ψ, we have

[formula]

The multiplicativity of the functional [formula] is thus proved.

The set [formula] of all characters of the algebra [formula] is closed under the binary operations [formula] and [formula], and under the unary operation [formula] of the reflection.

If φ and ψ are elements of [formula] then, by the multiplicativity of the operator s and according to Proposition [\ref=mult], we have

[formula]

Analogously, by the multiplicativity of the operator p, we have

[formula]

The multiplicativity of the functionals [formula] and [formula], and the closeness of [formula] under both convolutions is thus proved. Since the operator n is also multiplicative, for any character φ we obtain

[formula]

Consequently, the functional [formula] is a character.

The set [formula] of all  characters of the algebra [formula] is a commutative ring with the operation of addition [formula], multiplication [formula], zero θ and the unit element ε.

Taking into account Propositions [\ref=associate], [\ref=neutral], [\ref=stable] it remains to prove the existence of an opposite for any character χ and to verify the distributivity

[formula]

Let us show that the additive convolution of a character χ with another character [formula] results in an additively neutral character θ. Indeed, for an arbitrary periodic function u we have

[formula]

Let p be the period of the function u. As it follows from Proposition [\ref=delta], there exists an integer kp  =  (p;χ) such that for the arbitrary element v from [formula] the value of the functional χ is v(kp). Hence

[formula]

Thus, [formula]. Let us verify the distributivity for an arbitrary function [formula] . Applying first the left-hand side of the equality [\eqref=distr] to u:

[formula]

and then its right-hand side:

[formula]

we see that the relation [\eqref=distr] holds.

In what follows, the binary operation [formula] will be written as [formula].

Topological ring [formula].

Cluster topology in the ring [formula].

Let p be an arbitrary positive integer.

We shall say that elements φ and ψ of the ring of characters are p-equivalent if the functionals φ and ψ coincide on the subalgebra [formula]. Denote by Vp(ψ) the p-equivalence class containing the character ψ. These classes will be called clusters.

The character ψ is the unique element which belongs to all clusters Vn(ψ).

Let φ∈Vn(ψ) for all positive integers n. Let us show that φ  =  ψ. Since each function u from [formula] is periodic, it belongs to a subalgebra [formula]. But as [formula], we have φ(u) = ψ(u). As p is an arbitrary function, the functionals φ and ψ coincide on the whole algebra [formula].

For any character ψ and positive integers m and n we have [formula]. where [formula] is the least common multiple of m and n.

It is obvious that every m-periodic function u is also [formula]-periodic. Therefore the coincidence of the functionals φ and ψ on the subalgebra [formula] implies their coincidence on the subalgebra [formula]. In other words, [formula]. Analogously, [formula].

Propositions [\ref=separate] and [\ref=basis] mean that the system of clusters Vn(ψ) can be considered as a base of neighborhoods of the point [formula] which defines a Hausdorff topology on [formula].

A topology defined by the base of neighborhoods Vn(ψ) in the ring [formula] will be called a cluster topology.

In the following we will denote the clusters Vn(θ) by Vn.

Any cluster Vn is a symmetric subset of [formula].

We have to show that if φ belongs to Vn then [formula] belongs to Vn as well. The cluster Vn consists of the elements of the ring [formula] which act as the zero element on n-periodic functions: φ(u) = θ(u) = u(0). Hence for these functions we have [formula] and [formula].

Each cluster Vn is a subgroup in the additive group of the ring [formula].

In view of Proposition  [\ref=symmetry], it is sufficient to show that the cluster Vn is closed under additive convolution. Let φ and ψ be elements of Vn. For any n-periodic function u we have

[formula]

so that [formula].

The cluster Vn is an ideal of the ring [formula].

Let φ be an arbitrary character, and let ψ be an element of the cluster Vn. For each n-periodic function u we have

[formula]

so [formula] is an element of Vn.

Vn(ψ) is a ψ-translation of the cluster Vn.

Recall that the ψ-translation (Vn)ψ of the subset [formula] is defined by the equality [formula]. Hence φ∈(Vn)ψ if and only if [formula]. Since Vn is symmetric, without loss of generality we can consider 0  ≤  (n;ψ)  ≤  (n;φ)  ≤  n - 1. The fact that φ belongs to the set (Vn)ψ is equivalent to the fact that for any function u from [formula]

[formula]

Since the subalgebra [formula] separates the points [formula], the values (n;φ) and (n;ψ) coincide, which is equivalent to the coincidence of the characters φ and ψ on the subalgebra [formula], i.e., to the condition φ∈Vn(ψ).

The cluster topology is compatible with the ring structure of [formula].

As noted in Proposition  [\ref=translations], the base of neighborhoods of an arbitrary point ψ from the ring [formula] consists of the zero neighborhoods translations which, by Proposition  [\ref=symmetry], are symmetric subsets of the ring [formula]. It remains to prove that the clusters Vn satisfy the following conditions from Section [\ref=base]:

The zero of the ring [formula] is the unique element which belongs to all Vn.

The intersection [formula] includes some neighborhood of zero.

For each neighborhood Vn there exists a neighborhood Vm such that [formula].

For each neighborhood Vn and for any [formula] one can find a neighborhood Vm such that [formula].

For any neighborhood Vn there exists a neighborhood Vm such that [formula].

It follows from Proposition [\ref=separate] that the character θ is the only element belonging to all clusters Vn, while Proposition [\ref=basis] implies the condition  (2): [formula]. Next, in view of Proposition [\ref=add], Vn is a subgroup in the additive group of the ring [formula], therefore the condition (3) is satisfied, for instance, if m = n. Finally, (4) and (5), for m = n, follow from the fact that, in view of Proposition [\ref=ideal], Vn is an ideal of the commutative ring [formula].

Cluster topology as the Gelfand topology.

Let us correlate the cluster topology and the Gelfand topology [formula] which, according to [\eqref=neighborhood], can be determined by the subbase of the neighborhoods of the points [formula]:

[formula]

The cluster Vn(ψ) can be represented in the form

[formula]

where R is an arbitrary number from the interval (0;1), and the functions enj are indicators of the rasters Rn(j) considered in Proposition [\ref=indicators].

First we show that Vn(ψ) belongs to every neighborhood U R(enj;ψ) for any positive R. Since enj are elements of the subalgebra [formula], where the functionals from Vn(ψ) coincide, then for any φ∈Vn(ψ) we have

[formula]

Thus, the right-hand side of the equality [\eqref=representation] incudes the left-hand one. Now we prove the converse inclusion. Suppose that character φ belongs to all the neighborhoods U R(enj;ψ). According to Proposition [\ref=delta], its contraction to the subalgebra [formula] has the form φ(u) = u((n;φ)), where 0  ≤  (n;φ)  ≤  n - 1. Consequently,

[formula]

Since ψ belongs to every neighborhood U R(enj;ψ), then ψ(enj) = δj(n;ψ). Thus, for all 0  ≤  j  ≤  n - 1 the following inequalities hold:

[formula]

which mean that for any j the integer δj(n;φ)  -  δj(n;ψ) can only be zero. It follows that (n;φ) = (n;ψ), and therefore

[formula]

on all u from [formula] and character φ belongs to the cluster Vn(ψ).

The Gelfand topology [formula] in the ring of characters [formula] coincides with the cluster topology and thus is consistent with the ring structure of [formula].

In the Gelfand topology [formula], finite intersections of the type [formula] form a basis of neighborhoods of the point ψ, where uj are arbitrary periodic functions on [formula], and Rj are arbitrary positive numbers. The equality [\eqref=representation] shows that each cluster Vn(ψ) belongs to the base of neighborhoods of the point ψ. Consequently, the cluster topology is weaker than the topology [formula]. Conversely, let p be the common period of the functions uj which form the neighborhood U of the element ψ. For φ from the cluster Vp we have

[formula]

for all values of the index j, so that Vp  ⊆  U, and the topology [formula] is weaker than the cluster topology.

Introduction into polyadic analysis

Ring [formula] of polyadic numbers

Let [formula] be the commutative ring of all sequences [formula] with pointwise operations of addition and multiplication induced from [formula].

A constant α coincides with the result of its shift S defined by the equality (Sα)n  =  αn + 1. Associating to every integer m the constant of the same value, we can consider the ring [formula] as a subring of all constants from the ring [formula]. Without risk of confusion, we shall use the same notation for constants and their values.

As usually, a statement is said to be true for almost all positive integers n if it is false only for a finite number of [formula].

Let us introduce a congruence relation in the ring of sequences [formula].

We shall write [formula] for sequences α and β if for each positive integer n the congruences [formula] hold for almost all [formula].

In particular, this definition implies that any two sequences with a finite number of different elements are congruent, and a sequence is congruent with the null constant if for each positive integer n almost all its elements are divisible by n. This is is an obvious analogue of the fact that zero is divisible by any positive integer. Thus a sequence congruent with the null constant will be called a 0-sequence. It is easy to see that 0-sequences form an ideal [formula] of the ring [formula] stable under the shift S which makes it possible to apply the shift operation S to elements of the quotient-ring [formula]. In addition, the elements [formula] of the form αp [formula] can be divided by p: if almost all components of the sequence αp are divisible by an arbitrary preassigned np, then almost all components of the sequence α are divisible by an arbitrary preassigned n.

By polyadic number we will call any constant from the commutative ring [formula], i. e. any class [formula] of congruent sequences α such that [formula]. We will say that the sequence α∈ represents the polyadic number α.

Polyadic numbers form a ring denoted by [formula]. The ring [formula] can be considered as a module over the ring [formula] if we define the product m of a positive integer m by an arbitrary [formula] from [formula] as a class of all sequences congruent to sequences of the form mα (α∈).

By associating each positive integer m with the element Z(m) of the ring [formula] containing the constant sequence with the value m, we obtain the canonical embedding [formula].

This embedding whose image will be denoted by [formula] is a strict homomorphism of the rings.

We will say that an element Z(m) of the ring [formula] is an integer polyadic number with the value m.

If a sequence β = nα [formula] represents a polyadic number [formula], then the sequence α represents a polyadic number as well.

Since n(α - Sα) = β - Sβ is the 0-sequence and since in [formula] the division by [formula] is admissible, then α - Sα is the 0- sequence.

Topological ring [formula]

.

Let us associate each positive integer n with the principal ideal [formula] of the ring [formula] defined by the following equality

[formula]

The zero of the ring [formula] is the unique element belonging to all ideals [formula].

Let the class [formula] be common to all [formula], and let p be an arbitrary positive integer. Then, in particular, [formula]. All components of a sequence β  =  αp from the class [formula] are divisible by p. Hence almost all components of any sequence from the class [formula] are divisible by any arbitrary positive integer p, and thus [formula] is zero of the ring [formula].

If a positive integer p divides a positive integer n then [formula].

Let [formula], i. e.  = n, where [formula] is an element of the ring [formula], and let n = pd. All elements of the sequence γ = nβ = p(dβ) from the class [formula] are divisible by p. Therefore, almost all elements of any sequence from the class [formula] are divisible by p, and [formula].

For arbitrary positive integers m and n the following equality [formula] holds, where [formula] is the least common multiple of the numbers m and n.

As m and n divide [formula], the inclusion [formula] follows from Proposition [\ref=inclusion].

Let us verify the converse inclusion. Let [formula], then  = m, and  = n, where [formula], [formula] are elements of the ring [formula]. Denote by [formula] the greatest common divisor of the numbers m and n. The following equalities hold:

[formula]

If the elements [formula] and [formula] are represented by sequences α and β respectively, then [formula]. In view of Proposition [\ref=division], [formula], so that the difference αkp - βkq is divisible by pq for almost all k. As [formula], for almost all k there are numbers α'k and β'k such that αk  =  α'kq, and βk  =  β'kp. Arbitrarily extending the functions k  ↦  α'k and k  ↦  β'k to the sequences α' and β', we obtain (taking into account equalities [\eqref=lor]) the representations of the class [formula] by the sequences [formula] and [formula]

We shall introduce a Hausdorff topology in the ring of polyadic numbers making it a topological ring.

The ideals [formula] form a (countable) base of zero neighborhoods, defining in the ring [formula] a Hausdorff topology [formula] compatible with its algebraic structure.

A base of zero neighborhoods is defined in Section [\ref=base]. Condition (1) holds by virtue of the Proposition [\ref=zero]. Condition (2) is provided by Proposition [\ref=lor]. The remaining conditions hold because [formula] are ideals: here one and the same set [formula] can be used for both sets U and V.

Compactness of the ring [formula]

Grids. Finite partitions of the space [formula]

We call by a grid [formula] with a width [formula] and a center [formula] any [formula]-translation of the ideal [formula], i. e. each subset of the ring [formula] having the form [formula].

For each point [formula] the grids [formula] form a base of its neighborhoods. Let us note some elementary properties of grids.

If [formula], then [formula].

Let   =    +  , where [formula]. Let us prove the inclusion [formula]. If   =    +  , where [formula] is an element of the ideal [formula] then   =   + (  -  ), where the element   -   also belongs to [formula]. Therefore, [formula]. The inverse inclusion can be proved analogously.

Each grid [formula] is open. In particular, the ideals [formula] are open in the topology [formula].

By Proposition [\ref=exchange], the grid [formula] is a neighborhood [formula] for any point [formula] of this grid.

If [formula] belongs to both grids [formula] and [formula], then  [formula].

In view of Proposition  [\ref=exchange], we should prove that

[formula]

i. e. that [formula] are translations of the ideal [formula], and the intersections [formula] coincide. The latter statement immediately follows from Proposition [\ref=NOK].

Thus, two arbitrary grids either do not intersect or their intersection is a grid as well.

If [formula] then the grid [formula] for any positive integer q is absorbed by the grid [formula]. Otherwise, the intersection of these grids is empty.

Let [formula]. Since [formula], then by Proposition [\ref=intersection],   [formula], therefore [formula].

Now let [formula] and let [formula] be an element belonging to both grids. Then we have [formula] and [formula]. Consequently, [formula], i. e. [formula], which contradicts our supposition of the existence of the element [formula].

The subring of integer polyadic numbers [formula] is dense in the topological ring [formula].

Let us verify that each grid [formula] contains some element from the ring [formula]. Let the polyadic number [formula] be represented by a sequence of integers α. Then there exists m such that [formula] for all k  ≥  m. By the transitivity of the congruence, [formula] for all k  ≥  m. Let [formula] be an integer polyadic number represented by a constant sequence ζ with the value ζk  =  αm. For k  ≥  m,

[formula]

hence   -   belongs to the grid [formula], which means that the integer polyadic number [formula] belongs to the grid [formula].

In the ring [formula] the theorem of the division with a remainder holds.

For a given [formula] each polyadic number [formula] can be uniquely represented in the form  = n() + (), where [formula], and () is an integer polyadic number with the value 0  ≤  r()  ≤  n - 1.

Let us prove the existence of this representation. In view of Proposition [\ref=dense], the grid [formula] contains an element   =  Z(m). Let m = kn + r, where 0  ≤  r  ≤  n - 1. Then we have

[formula]

On the other hand, the fact that the element [formula] belongs to the grid [formula] implies   =   + n, where [formula]. Comparing these two representations of the element [formula], we conclude that  = n  +  , where   =  Z(k) - , and   =  Z(r). Now let us prove the uniqueness. Suppose that  = n  +  Z(r), and  = n' + Z(r'), where 0  ≤  r  ≤  r'  ≤  n - 1. Subtracting term by term one representation of the polyadic number [formula] from the other, we see that Z(r' - r) = n(  -  '), i. e. non-negative constant sequence with the value r' - r < n and some integer sequence n(γk  -  γk') represent the same polyadic number. This is only possible when both sequences are 0-sequences.

The integer non-negative number r() defined in Proposition [\ref=ostatok] will be called a remainder of the division of a polyadic number [formula] by a positive integer n and denoted by

[formula]

For each positive integer N one can split the ring [formula] into N disjoint grids with width N:

[formula]

According to Proposition [\ref=ostatok], an arbitrary polyadic number [formula] can be represented in the form   =    +  Z(r), where the number [formula] belongs to the ideal [formula] and 0  ≤  r < N. In other words, [formula] belongs to [formula]. Since this representation is unique, the grids corresponding to different values of r do not intersect.

For any positive integer n and 0  ≤  k < n!, the grid [formula] split into disjoint grids with the width (n + 1)!:

[formula]

Let us set N = (n + 1)! in the equality [\eqref=partition]:

[formula]

Compare the intersections of the grid [formula] with the left- and right-hand sides of this new equality:

[formula]

Here again the right-hand side is a sum of disjoint components. Setting p = n!, q = n + 1,   =  Z(k),   =  Z(r) in Proposition [\ref=alternative], we conclude that these components are nonempty only when [formula], and in this case they coincide with the grids [formula]. It is easy to see that all numbers r from the interval 0  ≤  r < (n + 1)! form a progression r = k + n!  ·  m, where  0  ≤  m  ≤  n.

Each grid [formula] is closed. In particular, the ideals [formula] are closed in the topology [formula].

According to the equality [\eqref=partition], the number [formula] has to belong to some grid [formula]. Hence, in view of Proposition [\ref=exchange], [formula]. Let us show that the grid [formula] is closed. By Proposition [\ref=open], the grids [formula] are open, and in view of the equality [\eqref=partition], the grid [formula] is the complement of the (open) sum of the grids [formula] where r  ≠  k. Therefore, the (coinciding) grids [formula] and [formula] are closed.

Convergence. Hausdorff compact space [formula]

Convergence in the topological ring [formula] is defined in the standard way.

A sequence of polyadic numbers (n) converges to the limit [formula], if each neighborhood of zero [formula] contains almost all differences (n)  -  .

It is clear, that the ideal [formula] has to contain almost all differences  [formula]. The converse is also true which follows from the proposition stated below.

A sequence of polyadic numbers (n) converges in [formula] if and only if (n)  -  (n + 1)  →  .

Let (n)  -  (n + 1)  →  . Let us represent each polyadic number (n) by an arbitrary integer sequence α(n). By the definition of polyadic numbers, for any n one can find i(n) such that

[formula]

Without loss of generality we can consider the sequence i(n) as strictly increasing so that i(n)  ≥  n. Let us show that the sequence αn  =  α(n)i(n) represents some polyadic number [formula]. For an arbitrary positive integer p we verify that the difference α(n)i(n)  -  α(n + 1)i(n + 1) is divisible by p for almost all n. The condition (n)  -  (n + 1)  →   implies the existence of n(p)  ≥  p such that for n  ≥  n(p) the differences (n)  -  (n + 1) belong to the neighborhood of zero [formula], i. e. for k  ≥  j(n) all remainders α(n)k  -  α(n + 1)k are divisible by p. Now let k(n) =  sup {i(n),i(n + 1),j(n)} and represent the difference αn  -  αn + 1  =  α(n)i(n)  -  α(n + 1)i(n + 1) in the form

[formula]

For n  ≥  n(p)  ≥  p the second summand is divisible by p, while the first and the last ones are divisible by n! and (n + 1)!, respectively. Thus they both are divisible by p. Therefore, the above sequence αn indeed represents some polyadic number [formula], and for k  ≥  n  ≥  n(p) all differences αn  -  αk are divisible by p. Let us now verify that (n)  →  , i. e. for each n  ≥  n(p) and k  ≥  i(n), where the sequence i(n)  ≥  n is defined by the condition [\eqref=i(n)], the difference α(n)k  -  αk is divisible by p. To this end, we write it in the form

[formula]

As has just been noted, the first summand is divisible by p and in view of [\eqref=i(n)], the second one is divisible by n!. By virtue of the inequality n  ≥  n(p)  ≥  p, the second summand is also divisible by p.

The ring [formula] is a Hausdorff compact space.

In Proposition [\ref=Felix] the separability of the topology [formula] was proved. Suppose that [formula] is not a compact. Suppose that the open sets [formula] form a covering [formula] where a finite subcovering cannot be found. Then among the two grids of the partition

[formula]

one can find a grid [formula], which either cannot be covered with any finite sum of sets [formula], - otherwise, the whole space [formula] would have a finite covering of elements of the set [formula]. By Proposition [\ref=alternative], the grid [formula] can be split into 3 disjoint grids

[formula]

where at least one grid [formula] cannot be covered with a finite sum of sets [formula] and so on. In this way we obtain a sequence of grids

[formula]

which cannot be covered with a finite number of elements from the set [formula]. Since [formula], the difference Z(rk + 1) - Z(rk) belongs to the neighborhood of zero [formula]. By Proposition [\ref=criterium], the sequence of integer polyadic numbers Z(rk) converges in [formula] to some [formula]. Let [formula] is an element of the covering [formula], containing the point [formula]. Then [formula] belongs to the open set [formula] together with its neighborhood [formula]. Let m be such that [formula] for k  ≥  m. For k =  max {m,n} the number k! is divisible by n, so [formula] and [formula]. As [formula], according to Proposition [\ref=exchange], [formula], and the following inclusion holds: [formula], which contradicts our assumption.

Stabilizers

The notion of stabilizer is an interpretation of the polyadic numbers which allows one to relate the polyadic topological ring to the topological ring of characters.

Basic definitions

We shall say that the sequence  [formula]  stabilizes a function [formula] at the final value [formula] if for almost all n the equality u(αn) = v holds.

A sequence [formula] is said to be a stabilizer if it stabilizes each function [formula].

It follows from these definitions that for each periodic function u one can choose an integer n such that the final value [formula] will be u(n). A "uniformity" condition restricts the class of stabilizers.

A stabilizer α is absolute if there exists an integer n such that for all u belonging to [formula] the following condition holds:

[formula]

For any absolute stabilizer α there is a unique integer n which satisfies the condition [formula] (uniformly with respect to u from [formula]).

Let α be an absolute stabilizer, and let p be an arbitrary positive integer. Let [formula]. By definition, there exists an integer n such that the final value [formula] is equal to u(n). If there is another number n' which has the same property, then [formula] and the remainder n' - n is divisible by any positive integer p.

The above proposition allows us to introduce a function [formula] which is well-defined on the set of all absolute stabilizers α by the equality [formula].

The integer (α) will be called the value of an absolute stabilizer α.

To prove that the mapping [formula] is surjective it is sufficient to consider the constant sequence with the appropriate value.

Absolute stabilizers with zero value will be called zero stabilizers.

Thus, a zero stabilizer α can be described as a sequence of integers which stabilizes each function u from [formula] at the value u(0). Weakening this condition by exchanging the algebra [formula] for its finite-dimensional subalgebra [formula], we come to the concept of a prezero stabilizer.

A stabilizer α is said to be a p-prezero stabilizer if [formula] for any p-periodic function u.

Stabilizers and polyadic numbers

Let us describe the concepts given in the previous section in terms of polyadic numbers.

A sequence α is a stabilizer if and only if it represents a polyadic number.

Let α be a stabilizer. Then for any periodic function u we have u(αk + 1) = u(αk) for almost all k. In particular, for an arbitrary positive integer p we have

[formula]

for almost all k, i. e. [formula] for almost all k, and the sequence α represents a polyadic number. Conversely, let [formula]. Choosing an arbitrary function [formula], let us verify that the sequence α stabilizes u. Denote α'k  =  αk + 1  -  αk. As the sequence α represents a polyadic number, α' is a 0-sequence, and beginning from k = n the equalities α'k = pqk hold. Since u is a p-periodic function, we have for N  ≥  n

[formula]

Consequently, α is a stabilizer.

The class of zero stabilizers coincides with the class of 0-sequences representing the zero element [formula] of the commutative ring [formula].

Let α be a zero stabilizer. Then for any periodic function u almost all numbers u(αk) are equal to u(0). In particular, for any p the relation

[formula]

holds for almost all positive integers k. Therefore, [formula], since [formula] for almost all k. Conversely, let [formula], i. e. almost all elements of the sequence α are divisible by any preassigned positive integer. For an arbitrary p-periodic function u, let us verify that the final value of u exists and is equal to u(0). Indeed, for k  ≥  n(p) the equalities αk = pqk hold and in view of p-periodicity, u(αk) = u(pqk) = u(0).

Using the notion of a zero stabilizer, it is easy to describe the class of absolute stabilizers.

A sequence is an absolute stabilizer if and only if it represents an integer polyadic number.

Let α be an absolute stabilizer. Let us introduce a constant sequence αc with the value (α), and define the sequence αo as the remainder α  -  αc. Let us verify that αo is a zero stabilizer. For an arbitrary function [formula], we define the periodic function v by the equality v(  ·  ) = u(    ·      -  (α)). Since α is an absolute stabilizer with the value (α), the sequence αo stabilizes u at the final value u(0):

[formula]

Thus αo is a zero stabilizer, and by Proposition [\ref=criter_0], it is a 0-sequence, which implies that α is an integer polyadic number with the value (α).

Conversely, suppose that α represents an integer polyadic number with the value m, i. e. αk = m + αok, where αo is a 0-sequence and (by Proposition [\ref=criter_0]) a zero stabilizer as well. Let us verify that α is an absolute stabilizer with the value m. For an arbitrary function u from [formula], we define the function v by the equality v(  ·  ) = u(    ·   + m). As αo is a zero stabilizer, the sequence α stabilizes the function u at the final value [formula].

A sequence is a p-prezero stabilizer if and only if it represents an element of the ideal [formula].

Let α be a p-prezero stabilizer. By Proposition [\ref=criter], it represents a polyadic number [formula]. Let us show that [formula] belongs to the ideal [formula]. Indeed, by the definition of a p-prezero stabilizer, for almost all k we have

[formula]

hence almost all elements of the sequence have the form αk = p  βk, where β is some sequence of integers. According to Proposition [\ref=division], the sequence β represents a polyadic number [formula]. Therefore, α represents the polyadic number  = p  , belonging to the ideal [formula]. Conversely, suppose that a sequence α represents a polyadic number [formula] which belongs to the ideal [formula], i. e., for almost all k elements of the sequence have the form αk = p  βk, where β is some sequence of integers. By Proposition [\ref=criter], the sequence α is a stabilizer. Let us verify that this stabilizer is p-prezero. In view of p-periodicity, for [formula] the equalities u(αk) = u(p  βk) = u(0) hold for almost all k.

Isomorphism of the rings [formula] and [formula]

Algebraic isomorphism of the rings [formula] and [formula]

Let S be a functional ring of all stabilizers with pointwise operations induced from [formula]. Let us associate each stabilizer α from S with the functional [formula] defined by the equality

[formula]

For any stabilizer α the functional πα is a character.

Let e be the unit of the algebra [formula], i. e. e is a constant function on [formula] with the value 1. Since for any stabilizer α the composition [formula] is a constant sequence with the value 1, then [formula] and the functional πα is nonzero. For [formula] and any function [formula] we have

[formula]

which proves the homogeneity of the functional πα. Using the distributive properties of the composition [formula] and [formula], it is easy to verify its additivity

[formula]

and multiplicativity

[formula]

Thus, we have all the properties of characters.

The above proposition allows us to introduce a mapping π acting from the ring S into the ring [formula] by the rule π:α  ↦  πα.

The mapping π is a homomorphism of the ring S into the ring [formula], whose kernel ker π is the ideal [formula] of zero stabilizers.

First we prove that the mapping π is additive. It is sufficient to verify that the values of the functionals π(α  +  β) and [formula] are equal for any periodic function u. Let p be the period of the function u. Let us quote the equality [\eqref=oops] which holds for any function w, p-periodic with respect to both its arguments:

[formula]

For w(x,y) = u(x + y) this equality has the form

[formula]

Using this form, the composition [formula] can be rewritten as follows:

[formula]

Passing to final values, we have, on one hand,

[formula]

On the other hand, since φxψyu(x)v(y) = φ(u)ψ(v) for arbitrary characters φ, ψ and functions u, v from [formula], we have

[formula]

The additivity of the mapping π is thus proved. To prove its multiplicativity it is sufficient to verify that for any periodic function u the values of the functionals π(αβ) and [formula] coincide. For w(x,y) = u(xy) the equality [\eqref=again] can be transformed to the form

[formula]

then the multiplicativity of the mapping π can be proved in the same way as its additivity.

Thus we have ascertained that π is a homomorphism of the ring of stabilizers S into the ring of characters [formula]. Belonging to the kernel ker π for a stabilizer α is equivalent to the fact that πα is the neutral element θ of the additive group of the ring [formula], i. e., to the fact that πα(u) = u(0) for any function u from [formula]. Since [formula], then

[formula]

where [formula] is the ideal of zero stabilizers.

The homomorphic image of S is the ring [formula].

Let ψ be an arbitrary character. As noted in Section [\ref=almost], the algebra [formula] is the inductive limit of the increasing (with respect to inclusion) sequence of subalgebras [formula]. As [formula] does not contain the zero functional, for almost all n the contractions [formula] are nontrivial and beginning from n = n(ψ), we can define a sequence αn  =  (n!;ψ) which we extend as zero for smaller values of n. According to Proposition [\ref=WOW!], we have

[formula]

Let u be an arbitrary function from [formula] and let p be its period. We set q large enough to satisfy the inequality N = qp  ≥  n(ψ). It follows from [\eqref=stab] that for n  ≥  N the relation

[formula]

holds where, as usual, the "empty" sum is said to be zero. As N! is the period of the function u, for n  ≥  N we have

[formula]

Thus, the sequence α constructed above stabilizes any function u to the final value [formula]. In other words, πα  =  ψ.

Taking into account Proposition [\ref=homomorphism], we obtain

The quotient mapping [formula] acts as an isomorphism of the rings [formula] and [formula].

Isomorphism of the topological rings [formula] and [formula]

The following proposition shows that [formula] is not only an isomorphism of the rings [formula] and [formula], but an homeomorphism of the topological spaces [formula] and [formula] as well, since here the zero neighborhoods of the ring [formula] passe to the zero neighborhoods of the ring [formula].

For each positive integer p the cluster Vp is the image of the ideal [formula] under the isomorphism [formula].

As stated in Proposition [\ref=prezero], the sequence α represents an element of the ideal [formula] if and only if it is p-prezero stabilizer. Hence, the proposition will be proved if we show that the homomorphism π surjectively maps the set of p-prezero stabilizers onto the cluster Vp.

Let a stabilizer α be p-prezero. Then for an arbitrary function u from [formula]   [formula]. Thus πα∈Vp.

Conversely, let us suppose that a character belongs to the cluster Vp, i. e., the functional ψ has the value v(0) for any p-periodic function v. Then the stabilizer α constructed in the proof of Proposition [\ref=image] is p-prezero: [formula].

The following main result of this paper is an immediate consequence of Proposition [\ref=image] (Corollary) and Proposition [\ref=homeomorphism]:

The ring [formula] is algebraically and topologically isomorphic to the ring [formula].

This means that we can identify the polyadic topological ring [formula] of Prüfer, Van Dantzig and Novoselov with the topological ring of characters of the algebra [formula] consisting of all periodic functions on [formula].
