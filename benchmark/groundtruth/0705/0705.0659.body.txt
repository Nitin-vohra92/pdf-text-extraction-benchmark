Linear systems on a class of anticanonical rational threefolds

Introduction

Let X be the blow-up of the three dimensional projective space along r general points lying on a smooth elliptic quartic curve B. The aim of this paper is to provide an explicit algorithm for determining the dimension of H0(X,L) for any [formula]. This dimension depends of course on the degree and multiplicities of the general divisor of [formula] corresponding to L. In this paper we show that in fact this number is completely determined by the values of the intersections li  ·  L and C  ·  L, where the li's are the strict transforms of lines through pair of the r points and C is the strict transform of B.

This work is an attempt to generalize the results of [\cite=bh1] to the three dimensional case by extending the techniques used in [\cite=DL8]. Recently, in [\cite=CT] and [\cite=CEPG], an higher dimensional analog of the same problem is studied under the more restrictive hypothesis that all the points lie on a rational normal curve of [formula]. It turns out that this assumption implies the finite generation of the Cox ring of the blow-up variety, while in the case analyzed by the present paper this statement is false.

The paper is organized as follows: in section [\ref=notation] we fix the necessary notation while section [\ref=prel] focuses on preliminary results regarding the intersection theory of the varieties which are needed throughout the paper. The main algorithm is explained in section [\ref=algorithm], here we show how starting from the linear system L, associated to [formula], one can find a fixed-component free linear system L' of the same dimension of L. Then we proceed to define three different types of systems, listed in conclusion [\ref=concl_3_types], which cover the range of all the possibilities. The dimension of a linear system in each one of these classes is given explicitly in theorems [\ref=t=0], [\ref=2m] [\ref=m^r] and [\ref=t>0] [\ref=a].

Notation

The aim of this section is to provide the necessary notation for linear systems defined on blow-ups of [formula] and [formula] and a quadric. In what follows the ground field is assumed to be algebraically closed of characteristic 0.

The definition of X We start with a smooth quadric [formula] and a general B∈| - KQ|, i.e. B is an elliptic curve of degree 4. On this curve we choose [formula] points in general position and [formula] is a zero-dimensional subscheme with mi non-negative integers and associated ideal sheaf IZ. With abuse of notation we denote by

[formula]

both the sheaf [formula] and its associated linear system.

The expected dimension of such a linear system L is [formula], where

[formula]

is the virtual dimension.

Let [formula] be the blow-up map of [formula] along [formula], then we will denote by H the pull-back of a plane and by Ei the exceptional divisor corresponding to pi. In this way the linear system [formula] will correspond to the complete linear system

[formula]

defined on X. As before we will use the same notation for the linear system and its associated invertible sheaf. We will say that a system, on [formula] or on X, is standard if

[formula]

while we we call it almost standard if it becomes standard after reordering its multiplicities. The strict transform of B will be denoted by C.

The blow-up of Q We have the following commutative diagram

[formula]

where πQ is the blow-up map of Q at the pi's and [formula] is the exceptional divisor on Qr corresponding to pi. We will use the notation

[formula]

where ah1 + bh2  =  π*Q  ~  O(a,b) to denote both the linear system and its corresponding invertible sheaf. We will say that such a linear system is in standard form if

[formula]

and it is standard if there exists a base of [formula] such that the system is standard when written in that base.

A proof of the following proposition,which will be used several times in this paper, can be easily obtained by readapting the arguments of [\cite=bh1] to the blow-up of a quadric along points on a smooth anticanonical divisor.

Let D be an effective divisor of Qr, and let C∈| - KQr| be a smooth curve, then [formula] if and only if D  ·  C  ≤  0.

The definition of YI Consider the strict transform li of the line [formula] and denote by l1 the strict transform of the line through p2 and p3. Given a subset [formula], define

[formula]

to be the blow-up of X along all the li,i∈I and denote by Fi, the exceptional divisor corresponding to li.

When there is no ambiguity about r, we will use YI instead of YrI.

By abuse of notation, we will use H, resp. Ei, on YI, to denote the pull-back of H, resp. Ei; and we let C, resp. [formula] to denote the corresponding strict transforms. With

[formula]

where with d,mi,ti  ≥  0, we will denote the complete linear system and its corresponding invertible sheaf.

The definition of I Our last object will be the blow-up of YI along C defined as

[formula]

The exceptional divisor over C will be denoted by F and as before, by abuse of notation, we will denote the pull-back of resp. H, Ei and Fj with the same letters and the same for the strict transform of [formula]. With

[formula]

where d,mi,ti,t  ≥  0, we will denote the complete linear system and its corresponding invertible sheaf.

In all the above notation, if [formula], then we will write mk in stead of [formula].

Preliminaries

In this section we deal with the varieties X,YI and I just defined and we will work out their Chern classes and the intersection product of cycles on them.

A Cremona transformation of type (3,3)

To any four non-collinear points of [formula] we can associate a (3,3) birational map corresponding to the linear system L3(3;24). After a linear change of coordinates this map can be described by:

[formula]

This birational map induces a quasi-isomorphism [formula] of the blowing-up of two [formula]'s along four points. As a consequence, the induced map [formula] is an isomorphism which is described by the following:

The action of transformation ([\ref=cubic]) on [formula] is given by:

[formula]

where [formula].

Note that the points [formula] are still in general position φ(C), therefore the action of φ on a linear system [formula] results in a linear system [formula] and the same is true for the corresponding systems on X.

Observe that even if dim φ*(L)  =   dim L, in general the virtual dimensions of the two systems may be different (see e.g. [\cite=lu]).

Euler characteristic and Chern classes of the fundamental varieties

Let D be a divisor on a smooth rational threefold. According to the Riemann-Roch formula, the Euler characteristic of OX(D) is

[formula]

where c2(X) is the second Chern class of X and KX is the canonical class of X.

The threefolds we are going to work on will be [formula], X, YI and I. Hence we need to know KX, c2(X) and for these varieties.

Let π:  →  X be the blow-up of a smooth algebraic threefold X along a smooth, connected subscheme V  ⊂  X of dimension a  ≤  1 and let E be the exceptional divisor, then:

[formula]

where [formula] is the class of the curve V in X.

Using the fact that [formula] and [formula], we can deduce the following:

Let [formula] be a subset of cardinality a and denote by ε a number which is equal to 1 if 1∈I and 0 otherwise. The first two Chern classes of X,YI and I are:

[formula]

c2  =  6H2.

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula].

The first Chern class of all these varieties is easily determined by means of Proposition [\ref=c's_p1] and the same is true for c2(X).

To obtain c2(YI), we will assume for simplicity that [formula]. In this case, we can consider πI as the composition [formula], where πi:YIi  →  YIi - 1 the blow-up map of li and YI1  =  X. Since the class of l2 in the Chow ring of X is given by

[formula]

then, by applying Proposition [\ref=c's_p1], we obtain the following:

[formula]

Now observe that [formula] in X so that on YI we have:

[formula]

Repeating this argument for all [formula], and using the fact that [formula] for all i  ≠  j (because the curves li and lj do not intersect), we obtain that

[formula]

which gives the desired result.

For determining c2(I) we need to know the class of C in YI, which is given by:

[formula]

From Proposition [\ref=c's_p1] and [formula] (because li and C do not intersect) we deduce:

[formula]

which gives the desired result.

Intersection products

The aim of this section is to provide explicit formulas for the intersection of divisors on X, YI and I. In particular, given any three divisors on one of these varieties, we are interested in evaluating their intersection number. Since this number and that of the intersection of their pull-backs are the same, we need only to work out the calculations for divisors in [formula].

The following proposition will be needed in what follows.

Let X be a smooth irreducible threefold and S  ⊂  X a smooth irreducible surface, then c1(X)|S  =  c1(S)  +  S|S.

The non-vanishing intersection products of any three divisors (or their pull-backs) on X,YI and I are given below:

H3  =  E3i  =  1

[formula]

[formula]

HF2  =   - 4

[formula]

F3  =  2(r - 8)

We begin by observing that the following intersections ( i  ≠  j ):

[formula]

are numerically equivalent to 0 and the same is true for Ei  ~  F1 if i  ≠  2,3 and Ei  ~  Fj if i,j  ≠  1 and i  ≠  j. So, any intersection product of three divisors containing one of the above monomials must vanish.

Since H2 is the pull-back of the class of a line of [formula], it has non-zero intersection only with H and this intersection is clearly equal to 1. A general W∈|H| is the blow-up of a plane along #  I  +  4 points (because a general H of X intersects every li in one point and C in 4 points). On W, let h be the class of a line, ei the exceptional curve coming from the intersection point with li, and c1,c2,c3,c4 those coming from the intersection points with C. Then HF2i  =  e2i  =   - 1 and HF2  =  (c1  +  c2 + c3 + c4)2  =   - 4.

Observe that, on X, one has that - E2i is the class of a line of Ei, hence the same is true when we consider the pull-back of this class to I. This implies that E2i has non-zero intersection only with Ei and this intersection is 1.

If Ei and Fj intersect, it is easy to see that this intersection is a ( - 1)-curve on Fj, hence we obtain that EiF2j  =   - 1 and in the same way we have that EiF2  =   - 1.

On Fi, which is a ruled rational surface, let h denote the class of a section and f the class of a fiber. Then [formula], and it follows from Proposition [\ref=E|_E] that

[formula]

So, [formula], which implies that F3i  =  ( - h - f)2  =  2.

Similarly, on F, which is an elliptic ruled surface, let h denote the class of a section and f the (numerical equivalence) class of a fiber. Then [formula], and from Proposition [\ref=E|_E] we obtain that

[formula]

So, [formula], which implies that F3  =  ( - h - (r - 8)f)2  =  2(r - 8).

Cohomology of an invertible sheaf and its pull-back

The aim of this section is to recall a criterion for comparing the cohomology of line bundles on a smooth projective variety M together with the cohomology of line bundles on its blow-up [formula] along a smooth subscheme V  ⊂  M. To this purpose consider the blow-up map π:  →  M of V  ⊂  M, then we have the following:

For any positive integer i we have that [formula], which in turn implies:

[formula]

for any [formula].

The vanishing of the higher direct images of [formula] depends on the fact that, for p∈M, the fiber Fp: = π- 1(p) is either a point or [formula], where r is the codimension of V in M. From the projection formula [\cite=RH] we obtain:

[formula]

which implies that Riπ*π*L  =  0 for any i  >  0. The vanishing of the higher direct image of π*L and the isomorphism [formula] imply that [formula].

In the course of this paper, lemma [\ref=H^i_inv_sheaf] will be frequently used without referring to it. For example, the proof of the vanishing of [formula] on X will immediately give the vanishing of [formula] on YI.

The algorithm

In this section we provide an algorithm for reducing any linear system L to one of four types of standard systems, for which we can determine its dimension explicitely. To obtain the speciality of L it is then sufficient to compare [formula] and dim (L).

Reducing to a standard class

Given a linear system L we describe an algorithm for finding a new linear system L' which is in standard form and such that dim L  =   dim L'.

Input: [formula].

Sort the vector [formula] in decreasing order.

While ( 2d  <  m1 + m2 + m3 + m4 d  >  m1 )

k: = 2d - m1 - m2 - m3 - m4.

d: = d + k mi: =  max (mi + k,0) ( [formula] )

Sort the vector [formula] in decreasing order.

Output: [formula].

Observe that if d  <  m1 the system is empty. In this case the algorithm exit immediately from the main cycle and returns us a list which corresponds to an empty system.

The condition 2d  <  m1 + m2 + m3 + m4 has to be satisfied in order to decrease the degree of the system by means of a Cremona transformation. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, applying the Cremona transformation does not change the dimension of the linear system.

Finally, observe that if mi  <  0 then - miEi is in the base locus of L so that

[formula]

and this justifies our redefinition of mi.

After applying this algorithm, you either obtain that dim (L) =  - 1 or dim L  =   dim (L') where L' is a standard class with d  ≥  m1  ≥  0.

Three types of standard classes

In what follows the symbol LX will always denote a non-empty standard linear system of the form [formula]. Associated to this system we will consider also its restriction to Qr which will be denoted by LQ and is of the form [formula]. Observe that also this system is standard. We will use the symbol L to denote any one of LX or LQ. With this notation we have that:

[formula]

where C∈| - KQr| is the strict transform of the smooth quartic curve through the pi's.

Step 1: Splitting up according to t

Since LQ is standard and LQ  ·  KQr  ≥  1, the result follows from Proposition [\ref=har] (because the blown up points are general on C).

Note that r can not be smaller than 8 because in this case, since LX is standard, we would have that either c  ≥  1 or the system is of the form LX(2m;m8). This implies that b is well defined.

We proceed by observing that since LQ is standard and LQ  ·  KQr  ≥  0 then, by Proposition [\ref=har] we have that [formula]. Removing C from the system we obtain:

[formula]

where L1Q is still standard and L1Q  ·  KQr  =  LQ  ·  KQr  -  (r - 8). We repeat this procedure until the intersection of C with the residual system LtQ is positive or t  =  mr.

If b  =  r, then, taking t as in the statement of the claim, LtQ  ·  KQr  <  0 and Lt - 1  ·  KQr  ≥  0, which implies that [formula].

If b  <  r, then mrC is contained in the base locus of LQ. Consider now the decomposition LQ  =  mrC  +  LmrQ and let r': =  max {i | mi  -  mr  >  0}, then the class of LmrQ is the pull-back of a class on Qr' so that we can repeat the above arguments.

In case b = r', proceeding as before, we obtain that, for

[formula]

the divisor tC is contained in the base locus of LQ.

Since b  ≥  9 exists, after applying these arguments a sufficient number of times, our procedure comes to an end and we obtain that tC is contained in the base locus of LQ for the claimed value of t.

Note that we haven't proved that t = m in case (2), but the above arguments will still work to obtain that m9C is contained in the base locus of LQ. Since the residue class is then LQ(2m',2m';m'8), with m' = m  -  m9, the fact that t  =  m follows from [\cite=bh1].

Step 2 : Reducing to the case t  ≤  mr

In case (1) there is nothing to be done since t = 0.

In case (2), since the system is standard, we have that m  ≥  mi for any i. The fact that mC belongs to the base locus of LX implies that

[formula]

so it is sufficient to determine the dimension of the last system.

In case (3) we have that t  ≤  mr if and only if b = r. On the other hand, if b  <  r then mb + 1  <  t  ≤  mb and, since tC is contained in the base locus of LX we have:

[formula]

As before we need just to determine the dimension of the last linear system.

Step 3: Reducing to the case d  ≥  m1  +  t

The previous part allows us to limit our study to the case:

[formula]

In what follows we will adopt the notation:

[formula]

Assume that d  <  m1 + t, then r  ≥  10, the divisor M∈LX(3;3,1r - 1) is a cone contained in the base locus of LX and tr  >  0.

Since we reduced to consider the case t  ≤  mr, the positivity of tr follows immediately from the hypothesis. Observe that t must be positive and that LX can not be of the form [formula]. As noticed before this implies that r  ≥  9. Observe that the equality does not hold, since we in this case [formula] and

[formula]

where the first two terms in parentheses are non-positive and the third is negative because LX is in standard form. This implies that r is at least 10.

The linear system of [formula] given by L3(3;3,19) contains a unique divisor which is a cone over a plane cubic. Since

[formula]

we have that C is contained in the base locus of this system by Proposition [\ref=har]. This implies that dim LX(3;3,1r - 1)  =  0 if r  ≥  10 and the unique element M is the strict transform of the cone with vertex p1 and base curve B.

Let [formula] be a general element of the system that we are considering. Observe that any line l through p1 and q∈B has an intersection multiplicity with D at least

[formula]

This means that the strict transform of l is contained in the base locus of clX and this implies that M is contained in the base locus of LX.

Assume that d  <  m1 + t, then the system L'X: = LX  -  LX(3;3,1r - 1) is almost standard or empty.

In order to see that L'X is almost standard, it is sufficient to check that the multiplicities [formula] are non negative and that 2d  -  6 is bigger or equal to the sum of the biggest four multiplicities. Observe that if the inequality

[formula]

holds, then m1 - 3 belongs to the set of biggest four multiplicities and this gives the thesis. Assume that m1  -  3  <  m5 - 1 then we would have m1 - 1  ≤  m5  ≤  m1. The fact that LX is standard together with claim [\ref=cone_in_bs] imply that

[formula]

By substituting the two possible values for m5 we obtain a contradiction.

Summarizing the two claims we see that if d  <  m1  +  t then, either clX is empty or it is one of the following:

LX(3;3,1r) with r  ≥  10 and dim LX  =  0;

M  +  L'X where LX' is almost standard and dim LX  =   dim L'X.

In case (i) we know the dimension of LX. For case (ii), after reordering the multiplicities of LX' we obtain a new system L''X which is standard. To determine the dimension of L''X we repeat the procedure starting from Step 1 of section [\ref=step_1].

Conclusion

Using the above Steps, we see that we are reduced to determing the dimension of LX in the following cases:

C  ·  LX  ≥  1, i.e. t = 0.

LX  =  LX(2m;mr) with r  ≥  8, i.e. t  =  m.

1 + mr(8 - r)  ≤  C  ·  LX  ≤  0 and d  ≥  m1  +  t where [formula] and [formula],

Determining the dimension of L for case (1)

We begin by defining I to be set of indices i such that ti > 0. Observe that if I is non-empty then, since LX is standard, it must be one of these two types:

[formula]

The following theorem shows that h1(X,LX) is a function of the numbers

[formula]

where the li's are the strict transforms of lines indexed by I. This fact has already been proved in [\cite=DL8] for the case r  ≤  8. We will however make the proofs in this paper self-contained.

Without loss of generality, we may assume that mr > 0. This means our linear system LX satisfies the following conditions:

2d  ≥  m1  +  m2  +  m3  +  m4

[formula]

t1: =  max {0,m2  +  m3 - d} and ti: =  max {0,m1  +  mi  -  d} for [formula]

[formula]

Consider the blow-up πI:YI  →  X along the li, with i∈I and let LY be the complete linear system [formula] (and its corresponding invertible sheaf) on YI. Since, for all i∈I, the curve tili belongs to the base locus of LX, we have that dim LX  =   dim LY.

Now, using lemma's [\ref=c1] [\ref=c2] and [\ref=int_Y_I], an easy but tedious calculation shows that

[formula]

So, in order to prove theorem [\ref=t=0], it is sufficient to show that for i  ≥  1

[formula]

Denote by Sr: = LY(2;1r) and consider the exact sequence associated to a smooth ∈Sr

[formula]

Now, since [formula] does not intersect the exceptional divisor Fi of li, we see that [formula] is standard. It then follows from condition (4) and [\cite=bh1] that for i  ≥  1

[formula]

In order to obtain ([\ref=eq_h^i]), we obviously need the vanishing of the higher cohomology groups of [formula]. We begin by distinguishing two cases according to the values of r.

If r  ≤  3 then hi(Y,LY)  =  0 for all i  ≥  1.

Observe that as long as r  ≥  4, the system LY  -  Sr satisfies conditions (1)-(4) unless one of the following occurs:

d  >  m1 and mr  =  1

d  =  m1 and mr  >  1

d = m1 and mr = 1

Recall that s is defined to be the maximum of I and observe that if d  =  m1 then s = r.

So, if s  <  r, the system LY  -  Sr satisfies conditions (1)-(4), unless mr = 1. However, in this case, we can consider it as a linear system on Yr'I, where r': =  max {i | m'i > 0}. If we can prove the vanishing of the cohomology groups of LY  -  Sr on Yr'I, then, because of lemma [\ref=H^i_inv_sheaf], this implies the vanishing of the cohomology groups on YI. Note that, r'  ≥  s.

Moreover, if r = s, then case (a) cannot occur, because this would imply that m1  +  mr  -  d  =  m1  +  1  -  d  ≤  0, which contradicts tr  >  0.

In any case, if d'  >  m'1, then we can consider an exact sequence like before (using Sr' in stead of Sr if mr  =  1), and, using arguments as before, we can reduce to proving the vanishing of the higher cohomology groups of LY  -  2Sr (or LY  -  Sr  -  Sr' if mr = 1). Obviously, this procedure can be repeated untill we are reduced to proving the vanishing of the higher cohomology groups for a class [formula] satisfying conditions (1)-(4), and with either r  ≤  3 or r  =  s  ≥  4 and d  =  m1. Note that ti and I occurring in LY are in fact the same as the original ones.

We thus end the proof with the following:

Assume that [formula] satisfies conditions (1)-(4) with s = r  ≥  4, then hi(Y,LY  -  Sr)  =  0 for all i  ≥  0.

This can be regarded as the "toric case" by putting the three points p1,p2,p3 in (1:0:0:0),(0:1:0:0),(0:0:1:0) and observing that X and YI are toric varieties. The evaluation of the dimension of LX can be worked out by counting the monomials with multiplicities mi at these points. In the same way the cohomology groups of LX and LY can be found by purely combinatorial methods and in particular we have that hi(Y,LY)  =  0 for all i  ≥  1.

By hypothesis we have that ti  =  mi for [formula]. Now let ai: = mi  -  1 for [formula] so that

[formula]

with [formula] and denote this class by Ar.

We will now prove by induction on b that for any i  ≥  0

[formula]

for all b  ≥  1 and [formula].

An easy calculation, using lemma's [\ref=c1] [\ref=c2] and [\ref=int_Y_I], shows that X(Ab) = 0. Moreover, h0(Ab)  =  0 because the degree a1 - 1 is less than the biggest multiplicity a1. In this way it is enough to prove the vanishing of the first and second cohomology group.

If a1  =  0, then A1 is the system |  -  H| so that h1(A1)  =  h2(A1)  =  0 (see e.g. [\cite=RH]).

Now assume b = 1 and a1  >  0, so that A1  =  LX(a1 - 1;a1). Note that, because b = 1, we do not blow up lines, so we work on X1. Let W∈W  =  LX(1;1) and consider the exact sequence

[formula]

Since A1  -  W  =  LX(a1 - 2;a1 - 1), our induction hypothesis implies that hi(A1  -  W) = 0 for i = 0,1,2. On the other hand, because [formula], one easily checks that [formula] for all i  ≥  0.

Next, assume that b  >  1 and that the statement is true for b'  ≤  b - 1. On YbI, with [formula], consider the exact sequence

[formula]

Recall that, since [formula], the restriction of Ab - 1 to Fb is given by:

[formula]

A standard argument shows that hi(Fb,O( - 1,0))  =  0 for all i  ≥  0 and this, together with the vanishing of hi(Ab - 1)  =  0 ( by induction ) implies that hi(Ab - 1  -  Fb) = 0 for i  ≥  0. But

[formula]

Again we will use induction, now on ab, so we assume that the statement is true for all a'b  ≤  ab - 1. Let [formula] and consider the exact sequences

[formula]

and

[formula]

Since [formula], we have that [formula] for i  ≥  0. So, because of our induction hypothesis, the cohomology of the first exact sequence implies hi(A'b  -  OEb) = 0 for [formula]. On the other hand [formula], and one easily checks that [formula] for i  ≥  0. So, from the cohomology of the second exact sequence and the fact that A'b  -  Eb  -  Fb  =  Ab we conclude that hi(Ab) = 0 for i  ≥  0.

Determining the dimension of L for case (2)

As seen before, the dimension of [formula] is equal to the dimension of LX(2m;mr) and this number is evaluated in the following.

The virtual dimension of the system L3(2m;m8) is equal to m only if r = 8. This means that for bigger values of r the system is special.

The statement is trivial for m = 0, so assume m to be positive. Because of [\cite=DLB], we know that the base locus of the linear system L3(2m;m8) on X8, is mC. This implies that dim L3(2m;m8)  =   dim L3(2m;mr) for all r  ≥  8 (because all the pi's lie on C). And according to [\cite=DL8], we then obtain the statement.

Let us just note that the techniques used throughout this paper can yield an alternative prove of theorem [\ref=2m] [\ref=m^r]. More precisely, we can consider the blowing up [formula] of X along C, and the linear system Y: = Y(2m;mr;m) on [formula]. Using induction on m and cohomology of the exact sequence

[formula]

with ∈Sr: = Y(2;1r;1), one can obtain that dim (Y)  =  m. And, since obviously dim L3(2m;mr)  =   dim Y, this proves the theorem.

Determining the dimension of L for case (3)

We recall that ti: =  max {0,m1  +  mi  -  d}, for [formula] is equal to the opposite of the intersection of the strict transform of li with LX ( if this intersection is negative ). The same is true for t1: =  max {0,m2  +  m3 - d}, where the line is l1 through p2 and p3. Finally, the number [formula] can be described as

[formula]

The next theorem shows that the speciality of L only comes from lines li for which ti > 0 and from the curve C.

Note that, since LX is standard and C  ·  L  ≤  0 we have that r is at least 9. From the assumptions, it follows that 0  <  t  ≤  mr. Define I to be the set of i such that ti is positive and consider the system Y defined on I of the form:

[formula]

Since [formula] belongs to the base locus of LX, we have that dim L  =   dim Y. The linear system Y thus satisfies the following conditions

2d  ≥  m1  +  m2  +  m3  +  m4

[formula]

t1: =  max {0,m2  +  m3 - d} and ti: =  max {0,m1  +  mi  -  d} for [formula]

[formula], 0  <  t  ≤  mr

d  ≥  m1  +  t.

On the other hand, using lemma's [\ref=c1] [\ref=c2] and [\ref=int_Y_I], an easy but tedious calculation shows that

[formula]

So, in order to prove theorem [\ref=t>0] [\ref=a], it is sufficient to show that for any i  ≥  1

[formula]

Denote by Sr: = LY(2;1r;{0}i∈I;1) and consider a general element ∈Sr from which we have the exact sequence

[formula]

By abuse of notation, let C also denote the anticanonical curve on   ⊂  I, then [formula]. So, since [formula] and Fi are disjoint, we have that the restriction of Y to [formula] is:

[formula]

Observe that this system is standard because d  ≥  m1 + t and mr  ≥  t. On the other hand, condition (4) implies that [formula]. So it follows from [\cite=bh1] that [formula] for any i  ≥  1.

In order to obtain [\eqref=h^i_3a], we obviously need the vanishing of the higher cohomology groups of Y  -  Sr, which is of the form:

[formula]

First, let us check when [formula] satisfies conditions (1)-(5). Observe that conditions (1), (3) and (5) are always satisfied.

(2) is satisfied unless mr = 1 and in this case t  =  1.

(4) Since

[formula]

we obtain 0  <  t'  ≤  m'r unless t = 1.

In this way we see that t > 1, then the system satisfy all the conditions. This means that, if t'  ≥  1, we can consider an exact sequence as above, and, using arguments as before, we can reduce to proving the vanishing of the higher cohomology groups of Y  -  2Sr. Obviously, this procedure can be repeated t times, or thus untill we are left with proving the vanishing of the higher cohomology groups of

[formula]

Since t = 0, we only need to prove the vanishing of the higher cohomology groups on YI of the class [formula], which we will denote as LY. Now, since

[formula]

we have that the class LY satisfies the conditions of theorem [\ref=t=0] and we conclude that hi(LY) = 0 for i  ≥  1. As mentioned before, this is enough to prove the theorem.
