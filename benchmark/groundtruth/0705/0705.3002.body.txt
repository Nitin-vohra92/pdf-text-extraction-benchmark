Integral group ring of the McLaughlin simple group

Introduction, conjectures and main results

Let [formula] be the normalized unit group of the integral group ring [formula] of a finite group G. A long-standing conjecture of H. Zassenhaus (ZC) says that every torsion unit [formula] is conjugate within the rational group algebra [formula] to an element in G (see [\cite=Zassenhaus]).

For finite simple groups the main tool for the investigation of the Zassenhaus conjecture is the Luthar-Passi method, introduced in [\cite=Luthar-Passi] to solve it for A5. Later M. Hertweck in [\cite=Hertweck1] extended the Luthar-Passi method and applied it for the investigation of the Zassenhaus conjecture for PSL(2,pn). The Luthar-Passi method proved to be useful for groups containing non-trivial normal subgroups as well. For some recent results we refer to [\cite=Bovdi-Hofert-Kimmerle] [\cite=Bovdi-Konovalov] [\cite=Hertweck2] [\cite=Hertweck1] [\cite=Hertweck3] [\cite=Hofert-Kimmerle]. Also, some related properties and some weakened variations of the Zassenhaus conjecture can be found in [\cite=Artamonov-Bovdi] [\cite=Luthar-Trama] and [\cite=Bleher-Kimmerle] [\cite=Kimmerle].

First of all, we need to introduce some notation. By #  (G) we denote the set of all primes dividing the order of G. The Gruenberg-Kegel graph (or the prime graph) of G is the graph π(G) with vertices labeled by the primes in #  (G) and with an edge from p to q if there is an element of order pq in the group G. In [\cite=Kimmerle] W. Kimmerle proposed the following weakened variation of the Zassenhaus conjecture:

(KC)   If G is a finite group then [formula].

In particular, in the same paper W. Kimmerle verified that (KC) holds for finite Frobenius and solvable groups. We remark that with respect to the so-called p-version of the Zassenhaus conjecture the investigation of Frobenius groups was completed by M. Hertweck and the first author in [\cite=Bovdi-Hertweck]. In [\cite=Bovdi-Jespers-Konovalov] [\cite=Bovdi-Konovalov] [\cite=Bovdi-Konovalov-M24] [\cite=Bovdi-Konovalov-M23] [\cite=Bovdi-Konovalov-Linton] [\cite=Bovdi-Konovalov-Siciliano] (KC) was confirmed for the Mathieu simple groups M11, M12, M22, M23, M24 and the sporadic Janko simple groups J1, J2 and J3.

Here we continue these investigations for the McLaughlin simple group [formula]. Although using the Luthar-Passi method we cannot prove the rational conjugacy for torsion units of [formula], our main result gives a lot of information on partial augmentations of these units. In particular, we confirm the Kimmerle's conjecture for this group.

Let [formula]. It is well known (see [\cite=GAP]) that |G| = 27  ·  36  ·  53  ·  7  ·  11 and exp(G) = 23  ·  32  ·  5  ·  7  ·  11. Let

[formula]

be the collection of all conjugacy classes of [formula], where the first index denotes the order of the elements of this conjugacy class and C1  =  {1}. Suppose [formula] has finite order k. Denote by [formula] the partial augmentation of u with respect to Cnt. From the Berman-Higman Theorem (see [\cite=Berman] and [\cite=Sandling], Ch.5, p.102) one knows that ν1  =  α1 = 0 and

[formula]

Hence, for any character χ of G, we get that [formula], where hnt is a representative of the conjugacy class Cnt.

Our main result is the following

Let G denote the McLaughlin simple group [formula]. Let u be a torsion unit of [formula] of order |u|. Denote by [formula] the tuple

[formula]

of partial augmentations of u in [formula]. The following properties hold.

There is no elements of orders 21, 22, 33, 35, 55, 77 in [formula]. Equivalently, if [formula], then |u| coincides with the order of some element g∈G.

If |u| = 2, then u is rationally conjugate to some g∈G.

If |u| = 3, then all components of [formula] are zero except possibly ν3a and ν3b, and the pair (ν3a,ν3b) is one of

[formula]

If |u| = 5, then all components of [formula] are zero except possibly ν5a and ν5b, and the pair (ν5a,ν5b) is one of

[formula]

If |u| = 7, then all components of [formula] are zero except possibly ν7a and ν7b, and the pair (ν7a,ν7b) is one of

[formula]

If |u| = 11, then all components of [formula] are zero except possibly ν11a and ν11b, and the pair (ν11a,ν11b) is one of

[formula]

As an immediate consequence of part (i) of the Theorem we obtain

If [formula] then [formula].

Preliminaries

The following result is a reformulation of the Zassenhaus conjecture in terms of vanishing of partial augmentations of torsion units.

(see [\cite=Luthar-Passi] and Theorem 2.5 in [\cite=Marciniak-Ritter-Sehgal-Weiss]) Let [formula] be of order k. Then u is conjugate in [formula] to an element g∈G if and only if for each d dividing k there is precisely one conjugacy class C with partial augmentation εC(ud)  ≠  0.

The next result now yield that several partial augmentations are zero.

(see [\cite=Hertweck2], Proposition 3.1; [\cite=Hertweck1], Proposition 2.2) Let G be a finite group and let u be a torsion unit in [formula]. If x is an element of G whose p-part, for some prime p, has order strictly greater than the order of the p-part of u, then εx(u) = 0.

The key restriction on partial augmentations is given by the following result that is the cornerstone of the Luthar-Passi method.

(see [\cite=Luthar-Passi] [\cite=Hertweck1]) Let either p = 0 or p a prime divisor of |G|. Suppose that [formula] has finite order k and assume k and p are coprime in case p  ≠  0. If z is a complex primitive k-th root of unity and χ is either a classical character or a p-Brauer character of G, then for every integer l the number

[formula]

is a non-negative integer.

Note that if p = 0, we will use the notation μl(u,χ,  *  ) for μl(u,χ,0).

Finally, we shall use the well-known bound for orders of torsion units.

(see [\cite=Cohn-Livingstone]) The order of a torsion element [formula] is a divisor of the exponent of G.

Proof of the Theorem

Throughout this section we denote [formula] by G. The character table of G, as well as the p-Brauer character tables, which will be denoted by [formula] where p∈{2,3,5,7,11}, can be found using the computational algebra system GAP [\cite=GAP], which derives these data from [\cite=AFG] [\cite=ABC]. For the characters and conjugacy classes we will use throughout the paper the same notation, indexation inclusive, as used in the GAP Character Table Library.

First of all we will investigate units of orders 2, 3, 5, 7 and 11, since the group G possesses elements of these orders. After this, by Proposition [\ref=P:2], the order of each torsion unit divides the exponent of G, so to prove the Kimmerle's conjecture, it remains to consider units of orders 21, 22, 33, 35, 55 and 77. We prove that no units of all these orders do appear in [formula].

Now we consider each case separately.

[formula] Let u be an involution. Using Proposition [\ref=P:4] we obtain that all partial augmentations except one are zero. Thus by Proposition [\ref=P:5] the proof of part (ii) of Theorem [\ref=T:1] is done.

[formula] Let u be a unit of order 3. By ([\ref=E:1]) and Proposition [\ref=P:4] we get ν3a  +  ν3b = 1. Put t1  =  5ν3a  -  4ν3b. By ([\ref=E:2]) we obtain the system of inequalities

[formula]

from which t1∈{ - 22, - 19, - 16, - 13, - 10, - 7, - 4, - 1,2,5,8,11}. Now for each possible value of t1 consider the system of linear equations

[formula]

Since [formula], this system always has the unique solution. First we select only integer solutions, and then using the condition that all μi(u,χj, * ) are non-negative integers, we obtain only four pairs (ν3a,ν3b) listed in part (iii) of Theorem [\ref=T:1].

[formula] Let u be a unit of order 5. By ([\ref=E:1]) and Proposition [\ref=P:4] we get ν5a  +  ν5b = 1. Put t1  =  3ν5a  -  2ν5b. By ([\ref=E:2]) we obtain the system of inequalities

[formula]

so t1∈{ - 22, - 17, - 12, - 7, - 2,3}. Using the same arguments as in the previous case, we obtain only six pairs (ν5a,ν5b) listed in part (iv) of Theorem [\ref=T:1].

[formula] Let u be a unit of order 7. By ([\ref=E:1]) and Proposition [\ref=P:4] we get ν7a  +  ν7b = 1. Put t1  =  4ν7a  -  3ν7b. Using [formula] and [formula], by ([\ref=E:2]) we have

[formula]

It follows that we have only 174 pairs (ν7a,ν7b), given in part (v) of Theorem [\ref=T:1]. Note that using our implementation of the Luthar-Passi method, which we intended to make available in the GAP package LAGUNA [\cite=LAGUNA], we checked that it is not possible to further reduce the number of solutions, and the same remark also applies for the remaining part of the paper.

[formula] Let u be a unit of order 11. By ([\ref=E:1]) and Proposition [\ref=P:4] we have ν11a  +  ν11b = 1. Using [formula], by ([\ref=E:2]) we obtain the system of inequalities

[formula]

that has only that twenty pairs (ν11a,ν11b) listed in part (vi) of the Theorem [\ref=T:1].

[formula] Let u be a unit of order 21. By ([\ref=E:1]) and Proposition [\ref=P:4] we have

[formula]

Put t1  =  5ν3a  -  4ν3b  -  ν7a  -  ν7b, t2  =  5ν3a  +  2ν3b and t3 = 3ν7a  -  4ν7b. Since |u7| = 3, for any character χ of G we need to consider four cases, defined by part (iii) of the Theorem. Now we consider each case separately:

Case 1. Let χ(u7)  =  χ(3a). Using ([\ref=E:2]), we obtain the system of inequalities

[formula]

which has no integral solution.

Case 2. Let χ(u7)  =  χ(3b). Again, using ([\ref=E:2]), we obtain the system of inequalities

[formula]

This yields t1∈{ - 4,3}, t2∈{ - 5,2,9} and t3∈{7 + 21k| - 200  ≤  k  ≤  399}, but none of possible combinations of ti's gives us any solution.

Case 3. Let χ(u7)  =   - 2χ(3a) + 3χ(3b). Then using ([\ref=E:2]), we obtain the system

[formula]

from which t1 =  - 1, t2∈{ - 4,3,10} and t3∈{7 + 21k| - 196  ≤  k  ≤  391}, and again we have no solution for every combination of ti's.

Case 4. Let χ(u7)  =    -  χ(3a) + 2χ(3b). Using ([\ref=E:2]), we obtain the system

[formula]

so t1 = 1, t2∈{ - 1,6,13} and t3∈{14 + 21k| - 191  ≤  k  ≤  381}, that also gives us no solutions.

[formula] Let u be a unit of order 22. By ([\ref=E:1]) and Proposition [\ref=P:4] we have

[formula]

Now by ([\ref=E:2]) we obtain the system of inequalities

[formula]

which has no integral solution.

[formula] Let u be a unit of order 33. By ([\ref=E:1]) and Proposition [\ref=P:4] we have

[formula]

Put t1  =  5ν3a  -  4ν3b, t2  =  5ν3a  +  2ν3b and t3 = 32ν3a  -  4ν3b  -  6ν11a  +  5ν11b. Since |u11| = 3, for any character χ of G we need to consider four cases, defined by part (iii) of the Theorem.

Case 1. Let χ(u11)  =  χ(3a). Then by ([\ref=E:2]) we obtain the system of inequalities

[formula]

that has no integral solution.

Case 2. Let χ(u11)  =  χ(3b). Now ([\ref=E:2]) gives us the system

[formula]

which also has no integral solution.

Case 3. Let χ(u11)  =   - 2χ(3a) + 3χ(3b). By ([\ref=E:2]) we obtain that

[formula]

It follows that t1 = 0, t2 = 7 and t3∈{12 + 33k| - 30  ≤  k  ≤  11}, and we have no solutions again.

Case 4. Let χ(u11)  =    -  χ(3a) + 2χ(3b). By ([\ref=E:2]) we obtain the system

[formula]

which has no integral solution.

[formula] Let u be a unit of order 35. By ([\ref=E:1]) and Proposition [\ref=P:4] we have

[formula]

Put t1  =  3ν5a  -  2ν5b  -  ν7a  -  ν7b, t2  =  6ν5a  +  ν5b and t3  =  6ν5a  +  ν5b  +  3ν7a  -  4ν7b. Since |u7| = 5, for any character χ of G we need to consider six cases, defined by part (iv) of the Theorem.

Case 1. Let χ(u7)  =  χ(5a). By ([\ref=E:2]) we obtain the system

[formula]

which has no integral solutions.

Case 2. Let χ(u7)  =  χ(5b). Now the non-compatible inequalities are

[formula]

Case 3. Let χ(u7)  =   - 2χ(5a) + 3χ(5b). By ([\ref=E:2]) we obtain the system

[formula]

which has no integral solution.

Case 4. Let χ(u7)  =   - 3χ(5a) + 4χ(5b). By ([\ref=E:2]) we obtain the system

[formula]

so t1 = 4, t2∈{0,35} and t3∈{21 + 35k| - 58  ≤  k  ≤  228}, and we have no solutions again.

Case 5. Let χ(u7)  =   - 4χ(5a) + 5χ(5b). Using ([\ref=E:2]), we obtain

[formula]

Then t1 = 1, t2∈{ - 5,30} and t3∈{16 + 35k| - 58  ≤  k  ≤  228}, and we have no solutions as before.

Case 6. Let χ(u7)  =    -  χ(5a) + 2χ(5b). By ([\ref=E:2]) we have incompatible inequalities

[formula]

[formula] Let u be a unit of order 55. By ([\ref=E:1]) and Proposition [\ref=P:4] we have

[formula]

Put t1  =  3ν5a  -  2ν5b, t2  =  6ν5a  +  ν5b and t3  =  4ν5a  -  ν5b  +  6ν11a  -  5ν11b. Since |u11| = 5, for any character χ of G we need to consider six cases, defined by part (iv) of the Theorem.

Case 1. Let χ(u11)  =  χ(5a). Then by ([\ref=E:2]) we obtain incompatible inequalities

[formula]

Case 2. Let χ(u11)  =  χ(5b). Using ([\ref=E:2]) we obtain the system

[formula]

so t1 =  - 2, t2∈{1,12,23} and t3∈{ - 1 + 55k| - 4  ≤  k  ≤  17}, and in every case we have no integer solution.

Case 3. Let χ(u11)  =   - 2χ(5a) + 3χ(5b). By ([\ref=E:2]) we obtain that

[formula]

From this follows that t1 =  - 1, t2∈{2,13,24} and t3∈{11 + 55k| - 4  ≤  k  ≤  16}, and for every combination of ti's we have no solution.

Case 4. Let χ(u11)  =   - 3χ(5a) + 4χ(5b). By ([\ref=E:2]) we obtain the system

[formula]

which has no integral solution.

Case 5. Let χ(u11)  =   - 4χ(5a) + 5χ(5b). By ([\ref=E:2]) we have that

[formula]

so t1 = 0, t2∈{3,14,25} and t3∈{1 + 55k| - 4  ≤  k  ≤  16}, and again we have no solutions in every combination of ti's.

Case 6. Let χ(u11)  =    -  χ(5a) + 2χ(5b). Using ([\ref=E:2]) we obtain the system

[formula]

which has no integral solution.

[formula] Let u be a unit of order 77. By ([\ref=E:1]) and Proposition [\ref=P:4] we have

[formula]

Then using ([\ref=E:2]) we obtain the non-compatible system of inequalities
