Strong Stein Neighborhood Bases

introduction

A domain [formula] is called a domain of holomorphy if there exists a holomorphic function on Ω that cannot be "extended" past any boundary point. Any domain in [formula] is a domain of holomorphy. However, Hartogs in 1906 discovered that not every domain in [formula] for n  ≥  2 is a domain of holomorphy. This fundamental discovery led to the characterization of domains of holomorphy called the Levi problem. The Levi problem was first solved by Oka in 1930's for n = 2 and by Bremermann, Norguet, and Oka in 1950's for n  ≥  3. The solution of the Levi problem revealed a very interesting fact about domains of holomorphy: domains of holomorphy are precisely the so-called pseudoconvex domains and hence can be exhausted by pseudoconvex subdomains. That is, one can "approximate" a domain of holomorphy (or a pseudoconvex domain) from inside by pseudoconvex domains. Therefore, it is natural to ask whether it is possible to approximate such domains from outside. We refer the reader to [\cite=Ho] [\cite=Kr] [\cite=Ra] for precise definitions and basic facts about domains of holomorphy and pseudoconvex domains.

A compact set [formula] is said to have a Stein neighborhood basis if for any domain V containing K there exists a pseudoconvex domain ΩV such that K  ⊂  ΩV  ⊂  V. It is worth noting that the closure of the Hartogs triangle, [formula], does not have a Stein neighborhood basis. However, the Hartogs triangle is not smooth. In 1977, Diederich and Fornæss([\cite=DF77a]) found a smooth bounded pseudoconvex domain, the so-called worm domain, whose closure does not have a Stein neighborhood basis, thus answering in the negative a question of Behnke and Thullen([\cite=BehThullen]). Subsequently, the question of when a Stein neighborhood basis exists has been studied by Bedford and Fornæss [\cite=BF78], Diederich and Fornæss [\cite=DF77a] [\cite=DF77b], Sibony [\cite=Sib87] [\cite=Sib91], Stensønes [\cite=Sten], et al.

The existence of a special kind of a Stein neighborhood basis is known to be connected to global regularity of the [formula]-Neumann problem [\cite=St01], approximation properties for holomorphic functions [\cite=Cir] [\cite=FN], and uniform algebras [\cite=Ros61].

In this paper we will concentrate on smooth domains and "smooth" means C∞-smooth. However, the reader will notice that some of the results are still true for domains with C3-smooth boundary. We are interested in the following stronger notion of Stein neighborhood bases for smooth domains, as it is fairly general and has many applications. We say the closure [formula] of a smooth bounded pseudoconvex domain Ω has a strong Stein neighborhood basis if Ω has a defining function ρ (see the Section [\ref=sec2] for a definition) and there exists ε0 > 0 such that [formula] is pseudoconvex for 0  ≤  ε  ≤  ε0. In Theorem [\ref=MainThm] we give several characterizations for the closure to have a strong Stein neighborhood basis. The precise statement of Theroem [\ref=MainThm] requires some technical definitions, and so is postponed to Section [\ref=sec2-1]. We note that all smooth bounded pseudoconvex domains whose closure known to have a Stein neighborhood basis satisfy this condition. Whether it is equivalent to having a Stein neighborhood basis for the closure of a smooth bounded pseudoconvex domain is still open.

The existence of strong Stein neighborhood bases implies the so-called uniform H-convexity. A compact set [formula] is said to be uniformly H-convex if there exists a positive sequence {εj} that converges to 0, c > 1, and a sequence of pseudoconvex domains Ωj such that K  ⊂  Ωj and [formula] for [formula]. irka([\cite=Cir]) showed that uniform H-convexity implies a "Mergelyan-like" approximation property for holomorphic functions. There are three conditions that are known to imply the existence of a (strong) Stein neighborhood basis for the closure of a smooth bounded pseudoconvex domain in [formula] having a holomorphic vector field in a neighborhood of the weakly pseudoconvex points that is transversal to the boundary [\cite=FN], property [formula] [\cite=Sib87] [\cite=Sib91], and for domains in [formula] having a defining function that is plurisubharmonic on the boundary [\cite=FH] [\cite=FH2].

The following example shows that having a Stein neighborhood basis for the closure of a domain is not a invariant under biholomorphism in general.

Let [formula] be the Hartogs triangle, and [formula] be the bidisc in [formula]. Let F:Ω1  →  Ω2 be a biholomorphism defined as follows: F(z,w) = (z / w,w). One can check that [formula]. Therefore, although [formula] has a Stein neighborhood basis, [formula] does not.

It is still open whether having a Stein neighborhood basis for the closure of a smooth bounded pseudoconvex domain is invariant under biholomorphisms in general. However, an easy corollary to our main result (Theorem [\ref=MainThm]), is that having a strong Stein neighborhood basis is invariant under biholomorphisms that extend up to the boundary. More precisely,

Let Ω1 and Ω2 be two smooth bounded pseudoconvex domains in [formula]. Assume that there exist a proper holomorphic map F:Ω1  →  Ω2 that extend smoothly to [formula] and [formula] has a strong Stein neighborhood basis. Then [formula] has a strong Stein neighborhood basis.

At this point we would like to mention two open questions: Is the assumption of smooth extendibility of the biholomorphism in the Corollary above needed, or is it automatic? Does having a Stein neighborhood basis for the closure of a smooth bounded pseudoconvex domain imply the existence of a strong Stein neighborhood basis for the closure of the domain?

This paper is organized as follows: in Section [\ref=sec2] we set the notation and give basic definitions. In Section [\ref=sec2-1] we state the main theorem, Theorem [\ref=MainThm], and give an application to a potential theoretic property the so-called property [formula] (see Corollary [\ref=P-tilde]). In Section [\ref=sec3] we give the proof of Corollary [\ref=Invariance] and Theorem [\ref=MainThm]. In Section [\ref=sec4] we give the proof of Corollary [\ref=P-tilde].

We would like to take this opportunity to thank David Barrett, Harold Boas, Mehmet elik, John Erik Fornæss, Daniel Jupiter, Berit Stensønes, and my advisor Emil Straube for reading the early manuscripts, valuable comments, and stimulating discussions.

Notation and Definitions

Let Ω be a smooth bounded pseudoconvex domain in [formula] and r be a defining function for Ω. That is, r is a smooth function defined in a neighborhood U of [formula] such that it is negative on Ω, positive on [formula], zero on the boundary bΩ of Ω, and the gradient [formula] of r does not vanish on bΩ. We define the complex Hessian of r at z as follows:

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] are vectors in [formula] We would like to note that we identify [formula] with the (1,0) tangent bundle of [formula]. Namely, [formula] is identified with [formula] We will denote [formula] by Lr(z;A), and [formula] by [formula] where [formula] Let [formula] be the unit outward normal vector of bΩ at z. We denote the directional derivative in the direction [formula] at the point z by [formula] To simplify the notation and ease the calculation we will use the following notation:

[formula]

for a (type (1,0)) vector [formula] and [formula] It is a standard fact that a smooth bounded domain Ω is pseudoconvex if and only if Lr(z;W)  ≥  0 for z∈bΩ and W(r)(z) = 0 where r is a defining function for Ω. One can check that this condition is independent of the defining function r. When we refer to finite or infinite type of a point in bΩ, we mean type in the sense of D'Angelo [\cite=D]. Let Ω∞ denote the set of infinite type points of bΩ and

[formula]

ΓΩ is, in some sense, the unit sphere of the weakly pseudoconvex directions on the infinite type points. For a fixed vector [formula] and z∈bΩ we will denote

[formula]

where r is a defining function for Ω and [formula] Notice that Cr(z;A) is the directional derivative of the complex Hessian Lr(z;A) in the (real) normal direction at z for a fixed vector A. Cr alone does not guarantee that the level sets outside the domain will be pseudoconvex because it measures how the complex Hessian changes as one moves out of the domain for only fixed vectors. On the other hand, Er(z;A) gives a sufficient condition for the existence of a Stein neighborhood basis (see Theorem [\ref=MainThm]) because it takes into account how the complex tangent vectors change as one moves out of the domain. This change can be measured by Dr(z;A). We note that Dr(z;A) plays a very crucial role in the vector field approach of Boas and Straube for the global regularity of the [formula]-Neumann problem [\cite=BS91] [\cite=BS93] [\cite=BS]. This might suggest that there are deeper relations between the global regularity of the [formula]-Neumann problem and the existence of a Stein neighborhood basis for the closure.

Statement of the Main Theorem

The following is our main theorem. It gives several characterizations of having a strong Stein neighborhood basis for the closure of a smooth bounded pseudoconvex domain. It will be used in the proof of Corollary [\ref=Invariance].

Let Ω be a smooth bounded pseudoconvex domain in [formula] The following conditions are equivalent:

there exist a neighborhood U of [formula], a defining function ρ for Ω in U, and c > 0 such that [formula] for [formula] and W(ρ)(z) = 0,

there exists a defining function ρ for Ω and ε0 > 0 such that [formula] is pseudoconvex for 0  ≤  ε  ≤  ε0. That is, [formula] has a strong Stein neighborhood basis

there exists a defining function ρ for Ω such that

[formula]

there exist [formula] and a defining function r for Ω such that:

[formula]

for (z,W)∈ΓΩ.

Now we will give the definition of a potential theoretic condition: property [formula]. The following definition is from [\cite=McN].

Let Ω be a bounded domain in [formula]. Then Ω satisfies property [formula] if there exists a sequence of plurisubharmonic functions [formula] such that

|W(φj)(z)|2  ≤  Lφj(z;W) for [formula] and [formula],

[formula] for z∈bΩ and [formula].

We note that if Ω is a C3-smooth bounded pseudoconvex domain that satisfies property [formula] then for any defining function r there exists [formula] such that [\eqref=eqP_0] is satisfied [\cite=Sah06]. Property [formula] is related to another potential theoretic property called property (P). The difference is that instead of i) in the above definition, property (P) requires the sequence {φj} to be uniformly bounded on [formula]. By exponentiating and scaling one can easily show that property (P) implies property [formula]. However, it is still open whether the converse is true. Although these properties were introduced for studying compactness of the [formula]-Neumann problem ([\cite=Cat] [\cite=McN]) they naturally appear in the study of Stein neighborhood bases. We note that Harrington([\cite=Har06]) showed that property (P) implies existence of a Stein neighborhood basis for the closure when the domain is C1-smooth bounded and pseudoconvex.

As a result of our method we get a characterization of property [formula] in terms of existence of strong Stein neighborhood bases in some sense.

Let Ω be a smooth bounded pseudoconvex domain in [formula] Then Ω satisfies property [formula] if and only if for every M > 0 there exists a defining function ρ such that Eρ(z;W) > M for (z,W)∈ΓΩ.

An immediate implication of the above corollary is that property [formula] can be localized onto weakly pseudoconvex directions on infinite type points. We note that the localization of property [formula] has been obtained by elik([\cite=Celik]) in his thesis before.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=MainThm] and Corollary [\ref=Invariance]

The following Lemmas will be useful in the proof of Theorem [\ref=MainThm].

Let Ω be a smooth bounded pseudoconvex domain in [formula] Assume that Ω has a defining function r such that Er(z;W)  ≥  0 for (z,W)∈ΓΩ. Then there exists a defining function ρ for Ω such that Eρ(z;W) > 0 for (z,W)∈ΓΩ.

Without loss of generality we may assume that [formula] is contained in the ball centered at the origin and of radius τ  =  diam(Ω). Let us define ρ(z) = r(z)eh(z) where

[formula]

and [formula] Now we would like to calculate Eρ in terms of r. We note that [formula] and Nρ = e- hNr on bΩ. One can check that

[formula]

We note that

[formula]

because W is a fixed vector and

[formula]

We note that the second term in the first equality consists of a summation of dot product of vectors. Using [\eqref=forC_r] one can calculate that

[formula]

If we put the above calculations together we get

[formula]

So we only need to show that

[formula]

Let us denote [formula] by 〈W,z〉. Then one can calculate that

[formula]

Therefore, if we use the inequality [formula], the assumption that [formula] is contained in the ball centered at the origin and of radius τ, and the fact that [formula] we get

[formula]

Again since [formula] is contained in the ball centered at the origin and it is of radius τ we have

[formula]

This completes the proof of Lemma [\ref=geq0].

Let Ω be a smooth bounded pseudoconvex domain in [formula] and K be a compact subset of bΩ. Assume that z is of finite type for every z∈K and [formula] is given. Then for every j > 0 there exists [formula] such that |hj - h|  ≤  1 / j uniformly on [formula] and [formula] for z∈K and [formula]

Using Proposition 3 in [\cite=Sib87a] we can construct a smooth finite type pseudoconvex subdomain D such that [formula] Similar construction is used in [\cite=Bell86]. Catlin([\cite=Cat]) showed that finite type domains satisfy property (P). So D satisfies property (P). That is, there is a sequence of functions [formula] such that 1 / 2  ≤  fj  ≤  3 / 4 on [formula] and [formula] for z∈bD and [formula]. Let j denote a smooth extension of fj's to [formula] such that 0  ≤  j  ≤  1 on [formula]. We finish the proof by choosing [formula] for sufficiently large k.

We note that i)⇒   ii) is trivial and using [\eqref=E_rho] iii) ⇒   iv) is easy to see. To prove ii) implies iii) let us assume that Ω has a defining function ρ and there exists ε0 > 0 such that [formula] is pseudoconvex for 0  ≤  ε  ≤  ε0. Now we would like to differentiate Lρ(z;W) in the outward normal direction for (z,W)∈ΓΩ. If we apply [formula] to Lρ(z;W) for any smooth vector field W of type (1,0) such that W(ρ) = 0 on a neighborhood of Ω∞ and (p,W(p))∈ΓΩ (calculations are similar to the ones in the proof of Lemma [\ref=geq0]) we get So ii) implies that the right hand side of the above equality is nonnegative. Therefore, Eρ(p;W(p))  ≥  0 for (p,W(p))∈ΓΩ.

Let us prove that iv)⇒   i): We divide the proof into two parts. In the first part, we will produce a defining function whose sublevel sets are pseudoconvex (from Ω's side) outside of Ω in a neighborhood of the set of infinite type points. In the second part, using property (P), we will modify this defining function away from infinite type points to get a strong Stein neighborhood basis for the closure.

Analysis on Infinite Type Points. Using Lemma [\ref=geq0] we can assume that Ω has a defining function r and there exists a function [formula] such that

[formula]

for (z,W)∈ΓΩ. We extend h to [formula] as a smooth function and call the extension h. We scale h, if necessary, so that there is a neighborhood of [formula] on which the conditions of the theorem are still satisfied. We define ρ(z) = r(z)eh(z). We will show that there exists a neighborhood V of Ω∞, the set of infinite type points in bΩ, such that [formula] is nonvanishing on V, and the complex Hessian of ρ is nonnegative on vectors complex tangential to the level sets of ρ in [formula] Since Ω is bounded and [formula] is continuous and strictly positive on bΩ, the first part of the above argument follows immediately. It suffices to argue near a boundary point q because Ω is bounded.

Let [formula], and [formula] be a complex tangential vector to the level set of ρ at z. Namely,

[formula]

Now we will calculate the complex Hessian of ρ at z in the direction W. So first we differentiate ρ with respect to zj to get

[formula]

and if we differentiate ([\ref=eqnlevistep]) with respect to k we get

[formula]

Using ([\ref=eqnlevistep2]) in the last equality we get

[formula]

We would like to show that there exists a neighborhood V of infinite type points Ω∞ such that

[formula]

for [formula] and [formula] such that W(ρ)(z) = 0.

Claim: To prove ([\ref=eqf]) it is sufficient to prove that for any p∈Ω∞ we have

[formula]

for any smooth vector field W of type (1,0) such that W(ρ) = 0 on a neighborhood of Ω∞ and (p,W(p))∈ΓΩ.

Proof of Claim: Let us fix q∈Ω∞. Using translation and rotation we can move q to the origin such that the yn-axis is the outward normal direction at 0. There exists a neighborhood [formula] of 0 on which [formula] does not vanish. If [formula] is a complex tangential vector to the level set of ρ at [formula] (i.e. W(ρ)(z) = 0) then

[formula]

We introduce an auxiliary real valued function g as [formula] where [formula] and [formula] with wn given by ([\ref=eqnw_n]). We choose an open neighborhood U of 0 such that [formula] Let [formula] Notice that [formula] is compact and it is enough to show that for every [formula] there exists a neighborhood Up of [formula] in [formula] such that [formula] for [formula] and [formula] Due to the continuity of the complex Hessian this is true for strongly pseudoconvex directions. However, ([\ref=eqn5]) implies that this is also true for weakly pseudoconvex directions. So the proof of the claim is complete.

Let us differentiate f(z,W(z)) with respect to r(z) at p∈Ω∞. Using ([\ref=eqf]) we get:

[formula]

Since W is a weakly pseudoconvex direction we only need to compute the complex normal component of [formula] at p to estimate the third term of the above expression. Hence, we need to compute [formula] which represents the following: first we differentiate W by [formula] at p then apply the result to r and evaluate at p. Now we use the same calculations used to derive [\eqref=forC_r] and differentiate the left hand side of W(r)(z) + r(z)W(h)(z) = 0 to get

[formula]

Thus we have:

[formula]

If Y = τNr  +  ξ where ξ is the complex tangential component of Y then

[formula]

Then using the above observation with ([\ref=grad=1]) we conclude that the third term in ([\ref=eqbazuki]) is equal to

[formula]

Hence by [\eqref=E_rho] we have Eρ(p;W) > 0 for (p,W(p))∈ΓΩ.

Modification Away From Infinite Type Points. In the first part of the proof we showed that there exist a defining function ρ for Ω such that Eρ(z;W) > 0 for (z,W)∈ΓΩ. That is, there is a neighborhood V of Ω∞ such that the level sets of ρ are strongly pseudoconvex (from Ω's side) in [formula]. Now we will modify ρ away from infinite type points to get a smooth defining function r that will satisfy i). Let ρλ(z) = eλρ(z) - 1. One can show that

[formula]

Then we can choose open sets V1,V2,V3, and λ > 1 so that [formula] and Eρλ(z;W) > 0 for [formula] and W(ρ)(z) = 0. Let χ be a smooth increasing convex function on the real line so that [formula] for t  ≤  0 and χ(t) > 0 for t > 0. Let us choose A =  sup {2 + χ'(t):0  ≤  t  ≤  2}. Using Lemma [\ref=LocalP] we can choose a sequence of functions [formula] such that:

- 6 ln A < φj <  -  ln A on [formula]

- 6 ln A  <  φj <  - 5 ln A on [formula]

- 6 ln A < φj <  - 3 ln A on [formula]

- 2 ln A < φj <  -  ln A on [formula] and

[formula] for [formula] and [formula].

Let hj = eφj - 1 / 2. Then one can check that Lhj(z;W) > A|W(hj)(z)|2 + j for [formula] and [formula]. Let us choose [formula] and [formula] Then [formula] in a neighborhood of [formula]. One can calculate that

[formula]

Let r(z) = ρλ(z)eψj(z). As in [\eqref=E_rho] one can calculate that

[formula]

Since r(z) = ρλ(z) in a neighborhood of [formula] we only need to show that

[formula]

for [formula] and W(r)(z) = 0. Let us choose

[formula]

We note that χa and φj's are chosen so that χa'  ≥  0 and Eρλ(z;W) > 0 for [formula] and W(ρ)(z) = 0. Eρλ can be negative outside V in some directions but there exists b > 0 such that χa'(hj(z)) > b for [formula] and [formula]. So the right hand side of ([\ref=eqGlue]) is finite and, since A =  sup {2 + χ'(t):0  ≤  t  ≤  2}, one can choose j so that [\eqref=eqglue] is satisfied. Hence we showed that Er(z;W) > 0 for z∈bΩ and W(r)(z) = 0. Similar argument used in the proof of ii)⇒  iii) shows that there exists a neighborhood U of [formula] and c > 0 such that [formula] for [formula] and W(r)(z) = 0.

Now we will give the proof of Corollary [\ref=Invariance].

Let n1(p) denote the unit outward normal of Ω1 at a boundary point p∈bΩ1. Furthermore, let q = F(p) and n2 = F(n1). We note that n2 is transversal to bΩ2 at q and i) in Theorem [\ref=MainThm] implies that there exist a defining function ρ2 for Ω2 and c2 > 0 such that for

[formula]

for q∈bΩ2 and W(ρ2) = 0 in a neighborhood of [formula]. Namely,

[formula]

for (q,W(q))∈ΓΩ2. Let ρ1(z) = ρ2(F(z)) and extend F smoothly to some neighborhood of [formula]. So ρ1 is a defining function for Ω1. Since F is proper it transforms the complex Hessian of ρ2 to the complex Hessian of ρ1. More precisely, let JF denote the complex Jacobian of F. That is,

[formula]

Then one can show that Lρ1(z;W(z)) = Lρ2(F(z),JFW(F(z))) for [formula] and W(ρ1)(z) = 0 if an only if JFW(ρ2)(F(z)) = 0. Let us fix a smooth vector field [formula] of type (1,0) that is complex tangential to level sets of ρ1 on [formula] and denote [formula]. Since F is holomorphic and extends to the boundary ([\ref=ineq1]) implies that

[formula]

for [formula]. So we have Eρ1(z;A)  ≥  0 for (z,A)∈ΓΩ1. Therefore, Theorem [\ref=MainThm] implies that [formula] has a strong Stein neighborhood basis.

Proof of Corollary [\ref=P-tilde]

Let Ω be a smooth bounded pseudoconvex domain in [formula] Assume that for every M > 0 there exist a neighborhood U of bΩ and ψ∈C∞(U) such that |W(ψ)(z)|2  ≤  Lψ(z;W) and [formula] for z∈U and [formula] Then Ω satisfies property [formula].

One can check that Lh(z;W)  ≥  |W(h)(z)|2 if and only if - e- h is plurisubharmonic at z in the direction W. Without loss of generality we may assume that ψ  ≤   - 1 on U. Let A =  -  sup z∈bΩe-  ψ(z). Since [formula] is compact we can use a theorem of Demailly [\cite=De87] to choose Green's functions [formula] so that [formula] on [formula]. Then [formula] is a continuous plurisubharmonic function that can be extended to a neighborhood of [formula]. Using convolution with an approximate identity we may choose a function [formula] that is plurisubharmonic on Ω and arbitrarily close to F uniformly on [formula]. Let f(z) =  -  log ( - F(z)) and [formula]. Since [formula] is plurisubharmonic we have [formula] for [formula] and [formula]. Now we need to show that the complex Hessian of [formula] is large enough on bΩ. Since on a sufficiently small band close to bΩ we have [formula] one can show that

[formula]

where [formula]. Since [formula] on bΩ we have Lf(z;W)  ≥  Lψ(z;W) - |W(ψ)(z)|2 on bΩ. But we could have chosen ψ so that Lψ(z;W)  ≥  2|W(ψ)(z)|2 which would imply that [formula] on bΩ. We can choose [formula] sufficiently close to f so that [formula] for z∈bΩ and [formula]. Hence, Ω satisfies property [formula].

Using the proof of Theorem [\ref=MainThm] one can easily prove that if Ω satisfies property [formula] then for every M > 0 there exists a defining function ρ such that Eρ(z;W) > M for (z;W)∈ΓΩ. To prove the other direction let us assume that for M > 0 there exists a defining function ρ such that Eρ(z;W) > M for (z,W)∈ΓΩ. Let us define ρλ(z) = eλρ(z) - 1 and fix a defining function r for Ω. Then by ([\ref=eqGlue1]) we can choose a large enough λ > 1 so that [formula] for z∈bΩ and W(ρ)(z) = 0. Then there exist [formula] such that ρλ(z) = r(z)eh(z). By [\eqref=E_rho] the condition Eρλ(z;W) > M implies that

[formula]

for z∈bΩ and [formula] Let h̃(z) = h(z) / 2 and

[formula]

Since we can choose M as large as we wish for every [formula] there exist a neighborhood U of bΩ and h̃∈C∞(U) such that [formula] for z∈U and [formula]. Then Lemma [\ref=LocalGlobal] implies that Ω satisfies property [formula].
