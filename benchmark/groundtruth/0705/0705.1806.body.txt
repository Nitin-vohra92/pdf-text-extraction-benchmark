A transversal in a rooted tree is any set of nodes that meets every path from the root to a leaf. We let c(T,k) denote the number of transversals of size k in a rooted tree T. If T has n nodes and n  ≥  2, then

and

[formula]

The n - 2 upper bounds in ([\ref=sandwich]) are attained simultaneously if and only if T has precisely one leaf; the n - 2 lower bounds in ([\ref=sandwich]) are attained simultaneously if and only if T has precisely n - 1 leaves, in which case the root has n - 1 children. How high can these lower bounds be raised if an upper bound smaller than n - 1 is imposed on the number of children of every node of T? This is the question we are going to answer. Its creative interpretation has appeared in [\cite=F03].

Harary and Schwenk [\cite=HS] call a tree (an unrooted one) where removal of all vertices of degree one produces a path a caterpillar. Abusing this usage a little, we will call a caterpillar any rooted tree where removal of all leaves produces a rooted tree with precisely one leaf. By a full caterpillar of degree d, we will mean a caterpillar where each internal node, except possibly the lowest one, has precisely d children.

Let n and d be positive integers such that d < n; let T be any rooted tree on n nodes where each internal node has at most d children and let [formula] be the full caterpillar of degree d on n nodes. Then [formula] for all [formula].

In the special case where d = 2, inequalities [formula] with (essentially) [formula] were proved in [\cite=F06] by an argument different from the argument given below.

Given rooted trees T,T' on n nodes, we will write [formula] to mean that c(T,k)  ≥  c(T',k) for all [formula] and that that c(T,k) > c(T',k) for at least one of these values of k. With this notation, a refinement of Theorem [\ref=main] can be stated as follows.

Let n and d be positive integers such that d < n and let [formula] be the full caterpillar of degree d on n nodes. If T is a rooted tree on n nodes such that each internal node of T has at most d children, then [formula] or else [formula].

Our proof of Theorem [\ref=main2] relies on two ways of altering a rooted tree T so that the resulting tree succeeds T in the partial order [formula]. We shall describe these alterations in terms of the parent function of a rooted tree that assigns to each node z of the tree its parent p(z) -- except when z is the root, in which case p(z) is undefined.

Let T be a rooted tree defined by parent function p. Let x and y be nodes of T such that x is not the root and y is a proper ancestor of p(x). Let T' be the rooted tree defined by parent function p' such that

[formula]

Then [formula].

Proof. If z is a leaf of T, then z is a leaf of T' and every node on the path from the root to z in T' lies on the path from the root to z in T. It follows that every transversal in T' is a transversal in T, and so c(T,k)  ≥  c(T',k) for all k. To see that c(T,k) > c(T',k) for at least one k, consider the set that consists of p(x) and all leaves of T that are not descendants of p(x): this set is a transversal in T but not in T'.

Let T be a rooted tree defined by parent function p. Let x and y be nodes of T such that x is not the root, x is not a leaf, and y is a leaf which is a proper descendant of a sibling of x. Let T' be the rooted tree defined by parent function p' such that

[formula]

Then [formula].

Proof. Given any set S' of nodes in T', define

[formula]

If S' is a transversal in T', then f(S') is a transversal in T and |f(S')| = |S'|. If f(S1) = f(S2) and S1  ≠  S2, then at least one of S1,S2 avoids the path from the root to x, and so it is not a transversal in T'. It follows that c(T,k)  ≥  c(T',k) for all k. To see that c(T,k) > c(T',k) for at least one k, consider the set that consists of p(y) and all leaves of T that are not descendants of p(y): this set S is a transversal in T, but there is no transversal S' in T' such that f(S') = S.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=main2]. Consider any rooted tree T on n nodes such that each internal node of T has at most d children. Assuming that there is no rooted tree T' on n nodes such that each internal node of T' has at most d children and such that [formula], we shall prove that T is the full caterpillar of degree d. Lemma [\ref=shed] guarantees that no two internal nodes of T are siblings, which means that T is a caterpillar; in turn, Lemma [\ref=lift] guarantees that each internal node of T, except possibly the lowest one, has precisely d children.

Imposing an upper bound on the number of children of every node is a way of staying clear of the tree that attains simultaneously the n - 2 lower bounds in ([\ref=sandwich]), one where all children of the root are leaves. Another way to stay clear of this tree is to impose an upper bound on the number of leaves. There is a corresponding analogue of Theorem [\ref=main2] and this analogue also follows directly from our two lemmas.

Let n and m be positive integers such that m < n and let [formula] be the caterpillar on n nodes, where the root has m children and every node other than the root has at most one child. If T is a rooted tree with n nodes and at most m leaves, then [formula] or else [formula].

Proof. Consider any rooted tree T with n nodes and at most m leaves. Assuming that there is no rooted tree T' with n nodes and at most m leaves such that [formula], we shall prove that [formula]. Lemma [\ref=shed] guarantees that no two internal nodes of T are siblings, which means that T is a caterpillar; in turn, Lemma [\ref=lift] guarantees that no internal node of T other than the root has two or more children. qed
