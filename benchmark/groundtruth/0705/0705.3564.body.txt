New results of intersection numbers on moduli spaces of curves

Introduction

Let [formula] denote the Deligne-Mumford moduli stack of stable curves of genus g with n marked points. Let ψi be the first Chern class of the line bundle whose fiber over each pointed stable curve is the cotangent line at the i-th marked point. Let λi be the i-th Chern class of the Hodge bundle [formula], whose fiber over each pointed stable curves is H0(C,ωC).

We also have the κ classes originally defined by Mumford [\cite=Mu], Morita [\cite=Mo] and Miller [\cite=Mi]. A more natural variation was later given by Arbarello-Cornalba [\cite=ArCo]. It is known that the κ and ψ classes generate the tautological cohomology ring of the moduli spaces, and most of the known cohomology classes are tautological.

The following intersection numbers

[formula]

are called the higher Weil-Petersson volumes [\cite=KMZ]. These are important invariants of moduli spaces of curves.

In 1990, Witten [\cite=Wi] made the remarkable conjecture that the generating function of intersection numbers of ψ classes on moduli spaces are governed by KdV hierarchy. Witten's conjecture (first proved by Kontsevich [\cite=Ko]) is among the deepest known properties of moduli spaces of curves and motivated a surge of subsequent developments.

The intersection theory of tautological classes on the moduli space of curves is a very important subject and has close connections to string theory, quantum gravity and many branches of mathematics.

The n-point functions for intersection numbers

We call the following generating function

[formula]

the n-point function.

Consider the following "normalized" n-point function

[formula]

Starting from 1-point function [formula], we can obtain any n-point function recursively by the following theorem.

[\cite=LX3] For [formula],

[formula]

where Pr and Δ are homogeneous symmetric polynomials defined by

[formula]

where [formula], [formula] and Gg(xI) denotes the degree 3g + |I| - 3 homogeneous component of the normalized |I|-point function [formula], where kj∈I.

Thus we have an elementary and more efficient algorithm to calculate all intersection numbers of ψ classes other than the celebrated Witten-Kontsevich theorem.

Since [formula], Pr(x,y) = 0 for r > 0 and

[formula]

we recover Dijkgraaf's 2-point function and Zagier's 3-point function obtained more than ten years ago.

There is another slightly different formula of the n-point functions. When n = 3, this has also been obtained by Zagier.

[\cite=LX3] For [formula],

[formula]

where Pr and Δ are the same polynomials as defined in Theorem 2.

Okounkov [\cite=Ok] obtained an analytic expression of the n-point functions using n-dimensional error-function-type integrals. Brézin and Hikami [\cite=BH] use correlation functions of GUE ensemble to find explicit formulae of n-point functions.

Recursion formulae of higher Weil-Petersson volumes

We have discovered a general recursion formula of higher Weil-Petersson volumes [\cite=LX5], which is a vast generalization of the Mirzakhani recursion formula [\cite=LX4].

First we fix notations as in [\cite=KMZ].

Consider the semigroup N∞ of sequences [formula] where mi are nonnegative integers and mi = 0 for sufficiently large i.

Let [formula], [formula], and [formula] be a family of independent formal variables.

[formula]

[formula]

Let [formula], we denote a formal monomial of κ classes by

[formula]

[\cite=LX5] Let [formula] and dj  ≥  0.

[formula]

These tautological constants [formula] can be determined recursively from the following formula

[formula]

namely

[formula]

with the initial value [formula].

The proof of the above theorem is to use Witten-Kontsevich theorem, a combinatorial formula in [\cite=KMZ] expressing κ classes by ψ classes and the following elementary but crucial lemma [\cite=LX5].

Let [formula] and [formula] be two functions defined on [formula], where [formula] is the set of nonnegative integers. Let [formula] and [formula] be real numbers depending only on [formula] that satisfy [formula] and

[formula]

Then the following two identities are equivalent.

[formula]

When [formula], Theorem 4 recovers Mirzakhani's recursion formula of Weil-Petersson volumes for moduli spaces of bordered Riemann surfaces [\cite=Mir] [\cite=Mir2] [\cite=MS] [\cite=Saf].

Theorem 4 also provides an effective algorithm to compute higher Weil-Petersson volumes recursively.

In fact we can use the main formula in [\cite=KMZ] to generalize almost all pure ψ intersections to identities of higher Weil-Petersson volumes which share similar structures as Theorem 4. For example, the identities in the following theorem are generalizations of the string and dilaton equations.

[\cite=LX5] For [formula] and [formula],

[formula]

and

[formula]

Note that Theorem 6 generalizes the results in [\cite=DN].

New identities of intersection numbers

The next two theorems follow from a detailed study of coefficients of the n-point functions in Theorem 2.

[\cite=LX3] We have

Let k > 2g, [formula] and [formula].

[formula]

Let [formula] and [formula].

[formula]

[\cite=LX2] [\cite=LX3] We have

Let k > 2g, [formula] and [formula].

[formula]

Let [formula] and [formula].

[formula]

In fact, it's easy to see that Theorems 7 and 8 imply each other through the following proposition.

[\cite=LX3] Let [formula] and [formula].

[formula]

Since [formula] for k > 2g, [formula], by Mumford's formula [\cite=Mu] of the Chern character of Hodge bundles, it's not difficult to see that Theorem 8 implies the following theorem.

[\cite=LX2] [\cite=LX3] Let k be an even number and k  ≥  2g, [formula], [formula].

[formula]

Note that when k = 2g, the above theorem is equivalent to the following Hodge integral identity [\cite=GP] (also known as Faber's intersection number conjecture [\cite=Fab])

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula].

The above λgλg - 1 integral follows from degree 0 Virasoro constraints for [formula] announced by Givental [\cite=Giv]. However it is very desirable to have a direct proof of identity (1) when k = 2g, possibly using our explicit formulae of the n-point functions (see also [\cite=GJV]).

As pointed out in the last section, we can generalize all of the above new recursion formulae of ψ classes to identities of higher Weil-Petersson volumes. For example, we may generalize Proposition 9 and Theorem 10 to the following

[\cite=LX5] Let [formula], [formula].

[formula]

[\cite=LX5] Let [formula], M  ≥  2g be an even number and [formula].

[formula]

We also found the following conjectural identity experimentally, which is amazing if compared with Theorems 8 and 10.

[\cite=LX2] Let [formula], [formula], [formula].

[formula]

Since [formula], it's easy to see that the above identity is equivalent to the following identity of Hodge integrals.

Let [formula], [formula], [formula].

[formula]

Virasoro constraints and KdV hierarchy

From Theorem 4, we found new Virasoro constraints and KdV hierarchy for generating functions of higher Weil-Petersson volumes which vastly generalize the Witten conjecture and the results of Mulase and Safnuk [\cite=MS].

Let [formula] and [formula], we introduce the following generating function

[formula]

where [formula].

We introduce the following family of differential operators for k  ≥   - 1,

[formula]

where [formula] are defined by

[formula]

[\cite=LX5] [\cite=MS] We have Vk exp (G) = 0 for k  ≥   - 1 and the operators Vk satisfy the Virasoro relations

[formula]

The Witten-Kontsevich theorem states that the generating function for ψ class intersections

[formula]

is a τ-function for the KdV hierarchy.

Since Virasoro constraints uniquely determine the generating functions [formula] and [formula], we have the following theorem.

[formula]

where pk are polynomials in [formula] given by

[formula]

In particular, for any fixed values of [formula], [formula] is a τ-function for the KdV hierarchy.

Theorem 16 also generalized results in [\cite=MZ].

Denominators of intersection numbers

Let denom(r) denotes the denominator of a rational number r in reduced form (coprime numerator and denominator, positive denominator). We define

[formula]

and for g  ≥  2,

[formula]

where lcm denotes least common multiple.

Since denominators of intersection numbers on [formula] all come from orbifold quotient singularities, the divisibility properties of Dg,n and Dg should reflect overall behavior of singularities.

We have the following properties of Dg,n and Dg.

[\cite=LX1] We have Dg,n|Dg,n + 1, Dg,n|Dg and Dg = Dg,3g - 3.

[\cite=LX1] For 1 < g'  ≤  g, the order of any automorphism group of a Riemann surface of genus g' divides Dg,3.

The following corollary of Theorem 18 is a conjecture raised by Itzykson and Zuber [\cite=IZ] in 1992.

For 1 < g'  ≤  g, the order of any automorphism group of an algebraic curve of genus g' divides Dg.

The proof of Theorem 18 needs the following two lemmas (see [\cite=LX1]).

If p  ≤  g + 1 is a prime number, then ord(p,Dg,3)  ≥  2.

[\cite=Ha] Let X be a Riemann Surface of genus [formula], then for any prime number p,

[formula]

We have also obtained conjectural exact values of Dg for all g in [\cite=LX2].
