On Asymptotic Proximity of Distributions

Abstract. We consider some general facts concerning convergence

[formula]

where Pn and Qn are probability measures in a complete separable metric space. The main point is that the sequences {Pn} and {Qn} are not assumed to be tight. We compare different possible definitions of the above convergence, and establish some general properties.

Introduction and results

Background and Motivation

Usually, a limit theorem of Probability Theory is a theorem that concerns convergence of a sequence of distributions Pn to a distribution P. However, there is a number of works where the traditional setup is modified, and the object of study is two sequences of distributions, {Pn}  and {Qn}. The goal in this case consists in establishing conditions for convergence

[formula]

in a proper sense. In particular problems, Pn and Qn are, as a rule, the distributions of the r.v.'s fn(X1,...,Xn) and fn(Y1,...,Yn), where fn(  ·  ) is a function, and X1,X2,... and Y1,Y2,... are two sequences of r.v.'s. The aim here is rather to show that different random arguments X1,...,Xn may generate close distributions of fn(X1,...,Xn), than to prove that the distribution of fn(X1,...,Xn) is close to some fixed distribution (which, above else, may be not true).

Consider, for example, a quadratic form [formula], where An is a n  ×  n-matrix and [formula] is a vector with i.i.d. coordinates. In this case, the limiting distribution, if any, depends on the matrices An. For instance, with a proper normalization, the form X1X2 + X2X3 + ... + Xn - 1Xn is asymptotically normal (if E{X2i}  <    ∞  ), while the form (X1 + ... + Xn)2 has the χ21 limiting distribution. Nevertheless, one can state the following unified limit theorem.

Denote by PnF the distribution of [formula] in the case when each Xi has a distribution F. Then, under rather mild conditions,

[formula]

for any two distributions F and G with the same first two moments (see, [\cite=rotar1], [\cite=gotze1] for detail, and references therein). A class F such that ([\ref=i1+]) is true for any F,G∈F is called an invariance class ([\cite=rotar1]).

Let us come back to ([\ref=i1]). Clearly, such a framework is more general than the traditional one. First, as was mentioned, the distributions Pn and Qn themselves do not have to converge. Secondly, the sequences {Pn} and {Qn} are not assumed to be tight, and the convergence in ([\ref=i1]) covers situations when a part of the probability distributions or the whole distributions "move away to infinity" while the distributions Pn and Qn are approaching each other.

To our knowledge, the scheme above was first systematically used in Loéve [\cite=loeve], who considered sums of dependent r.v.'s. The same approach is applied in some non-classical limit theorems for sums of r.v.'s; that is, theorems not involving the condition of asymptotic negligibility of separate terms (see, e.g., monograph [\cite=zolotarev] by Zolotarev, survey [\cite=rotar1] by Rotar, and references in [\cite=zolotarev] and [\cite=rotar1]; Liptser and Shiryaev [\cite=liptser], and Davydov and Rotar [\cite=davydovrotar] on a non-classical invariance principle.)

Non-linear functions fn have been also considered in the above framework. In particular, it concerns polynomials, polylinear forms of r.v.'s, and quasi-polynomial functions; see, e.g., Rotar [\cite=rotar1] and [\cite=rotar2] for limit theorems, Götze and Tikhomirov [\cite=gotze1], and Mossel, O'Donnel and Oleszkiewicz [\cite=mossel] for the accuracy of the corresponding invariance principle. Other interesting schemes different from those above were explored in D'Aristotile, Diaconis, and Freedman [\cite=daristotile] and in Chatterjee [\cite=chatterjee1].

The present paper addresses general facts on convergence ([\ref=i1]). A corresponding theory was built in Dudley [\cite=dudley0], [\cite=dudley], [\cite=dudley1] and D'Aristotile, Diaconis, and Freedman [\cite=daristotile]. The paper [\cite=daristotile] concerns some possible definitions of convergence ([\ref=i1]) in terms of uniformities, and establishes connections between these definitions (see also below). The theory in [\cite=dudley0]-[\cite=dudley1] (which is used in part in [\cite=daristotile] also) is mainly based on a metric approach. We complement and, to a certain extent, develop the theory from [\cite=daristotile] and [\cite=dudley1], paying more attention to a functional approach. Throughout this paper, we repeatedly refer to and cite results from [\cite=daristotile]-[\cite=dudley1].

First, consider three definitions of convergence ([\ref=i1]) explored in [\cite=daristotile] (or, in the terminology of [\cite=daristotile], "merging").

for all bounded continuous functions f.

In [\cite=daristotile], it was shown that D3 ⇒   D2 ⇒   D1, and D1, D2, D3 are equivalent iff the space on which measures are defined, is compact. As one can derive from [\cite=daristotile], and as follows from results below, once we consider particular sequences {Pn} and {Qn}, the above definitions are equivalent if one of the sequences is tight.

In the general setup, when the above sequences {Pn} and {Qn} are not assumed to be tight, Definition D2 (and hence D3 also) looks too strong. As an example, consider that from [\cite=daristotile]. Let us deal with distributions on the real line, and let Pn be concentrated at the point n, and Qn - at the point [formula]. Clearly, ([\ref=i2]) is not true for, say, f(x) =  sin (x2). On the other hand, it would have been unnatural, if a definition had not covered such a trivial case of asymptotic proximity of distributions. (Clearly, in this case, π(Pn,Qn)  →  0. To make the example simpler, one may consider [formula]. Certainly, the example above concerns the Euclidean metric in [formula]. For other metrics, points n and [formula] may be not close. Below, we cover the general case of a complete separable metric space.)

To fix the situation, one can consider ([\ref=i2]) for functions only from the class of all bounded continuous functions vanishing at infinity, but such an approach would be too restrictive. In this case, the definition would not cover situations where parts of the distributions move away to infinity, continuing to approach each other (or, in the terminology from [\cite=daristotile], "merge"). On the other hand, in accordance with the same definition, the distributions Pn and Qn concentrated, for example, at points n and 2n, would be viewed as merging, which also does not look reasonable.

In this paper, we suggest to define weak convergence as that with respect to all bounded uniformly continuous functions. (This type of convergence was not considered in [\cite=daristotile] and [\cite=dudley1].) We justify this definition proving that such a convergence is equivalent to convergence in the Lévy-Prokhorov metric that satisfies some natural, in our opinion, requirements. In the counterpart of Definition D3, we require the uniform continuity of T.

We establish also some facts concerning weak convergence uniform on certain classes of functions f (or linear functionals on the space of distributions); see Section [\ref=sec.uniform] for detail. Proofs turn out to be, though not very difficult, but not absolutely trivial since the absence of tightness requires additional constructions. The point is that in the generalized setup, we cannot choose just one compact, not depending on n, on which all measures will be "almost concentrated".

On the other hand, as will follow from results below, if one of the sequences, Pn or Qn, is tight, the definition of weak convergence suggested is equivalent to the classical definition, and we deal with the classical framework.

We would like to thank P.J.Fitzsimmons and F.D.Lesley for useful discussions.

Main Results

Weak convergence and the Lévy-Prokhorov metric

Let [formula] be a complete separable metric space, and B be the corresponding Borel σ-algebra.

The symbols  P and Q, with or without indices, will denote probability distributions on B. All functions f below, perhaps with indices, are continuous functions [formula].

We denote by C the class of all bounded and continuous functions on [formula], and by [formula] - the class of all bounded and uniformly continuous functions.

For two sequences of probability measures (distributions), {Pn} and {Qn}, we say that Pn - Qn  →  0              weakly with respect to (w.r.t.) a class of functions K if [formula] for all f∈K.

If we do not mention a particular class K, the term weak convergence (or more precisely, merging) will concern that w.r.t. [formula]. When it cannot cause misunderstanding, we will use the term "convergence" in the situation of merging also.

In the space of probability distributions on B, we define - in a usual way - the Lévy-Prokhorov metric

[formula]

(One can restrict himself to only one inequality, not switching P and Q; see Dudley [\cite=dudley].)

Our main result is

The difference

[formula]

if and only if

[formula]

The choice of the Lévy-Prokhorov metric as a "good" metric that justifies the definition of weak convergence above, is connected, first of all, with the fact that the analog of the Skorokhod representation theorem ([\cite=skorohod], see also, e.g., [\cite=dudley1]) holds in the case of merging measures. More precisely, the following is true.

Let, the symbols X and Y, perhaps with indices, denote random variables defined on a probability space (Ω,A,P), and assuming values in [formula] (that is, these variables are A  →  B measurable.) The symbol PX stands for the distribution of X.

Below, two metrics r1(x,y) and r2(x,y) in a space are said to be uniformly equivalent, if for any two sequences {xn} and {yn}, the relations r1(xn,yn)  →  0 and r2(xn,yn)  →  0 are equivalent.

The first two (and main) assertions of the next theorem are stated and proved in Dudley [\cite=dudley]; see also the second edition [\cite=dudley1]. For the completeness of the picture, we present all facts regarding the metric π in one theorem.

Metric π is the only metric, to within uniform equivalence, that satisfies the following conditions.

If [formula], then π(PXn,  PYn)  →  0.

If π(Pn,  Qn)  →  0, then there exist a probability space and random elements Xn,Yn on this space such that PXn = Pn, Qn = PYn, and [formula].

If π(Pn,  Qn)  →  0, then [formula] for any uniformly continuous function f.

If Qn = Q, then the convergence π(Pn,  Q)  →  0 is equivalent to weak convergence with respect to all bounded continuous functions.[formula]

Remarks.

We have already mentioned above an example showing that convergence ([\ref=i2]) for all f∈C does not possess Property A. In other words, there exist r.v.'s Xn and Yn such that [formula], while [formula]weakly with respect to C. If [formula] has bounded but non-compact sets, a similar example may be constructed even for continuous functions equal to zero out of a closed bounded set.

Indeed, let Or(x) = {y:ρ(x,y)  ≤  r}. Consider the case where for some x0, the ball O = O1(x0) is not compact. Then there exists a sequence {xn}  ⊂  O which does not contain a converging subsequence. Furthermore, there exists a numerical sequence δn  →  0, such that the balls Oδn(xn) are disjoint, and each contains only one element from {xn}, that is, the center xn. We define

[formula]

The function f is, first, bounded, and secondly, due to the choice of {xn}, f is continuous. On the other hand, one may set [formula] and [formula], where yn is a point from the boundary of Oδn(xn). Clearly, ρ(Xn,Yn) = δn  →  0, while [formula] and [formula].

As was mentioned in the introduction, if one of the sequences, say {Qn}, is tight, and ([\ref=new4]) is true, then the other sequence, {Pn}, is also tight. In this case, relation ([\ref=i2]) is true for all f∈C, and we deal with the classical scheme. If [formula] is a space in which any closed bounded set is compact, this fact is easy to prove directly. In the general case, it is easier to appeal to Theorem [\ref=th1] and Prokhorov's theorem on relative compactness w.r.t. functions from C ([\cite=prokhorov]).

More precisely, assume that ([\ref=new4]) holds and {Qn}  is tight. Then, by Prokhorov's theorem, {Qn} is relatively compact with respect to weak convergence for functions from C. Let a subsequence Qnk weakly converges to some Q w.r.t. C, and hence π(Qnk,Q)  →  0. By virtue of Theorem [\ref=th1], π(Pnk,Qnk)  →  0, and consequently, π(Pnk,Q)  →  0. So, Pnk converges to the same Q w.r.t. to C, and

[formula]

Thus, any subsequence of {Pn} contains a subsubsequence convergent w.r.t. C. Hence, again by Prokhorov's theorem, {Pn} is tight.

Moreover, in this case Pn - Qn  →  0 w.r.t. C. Indeed, otherwise we could select convergent subsequences Pnk and Qnk and a bounded and continuous f such that [formula], which would have contradicted ([\ref=new5]

Let us return to Definition D3 from Section [\ref=sec.background]. To make it suitable to the setup of this paper, one should consider functions T on the space of probability measures on B, uniformly continuous with respect to the the Lévy-Prokhorov metric (or, which is the same, w.r.t. the weak convergence regarding [formula]). So modified Definition D3 will be equivalent to convergences ([\ref=new4])-([\ref=new3]).

Lipschitz functions

For f∈C, we set

[formula]

and [formula].

In Dudley [\cite=dudley1], it was shown that in the traditional setup, for the weak convergence Pn  →  P w.r.t. the whole class C, it suffices to have the convergence w.r.t. CBL. A similar property is true for the generalized setup of merging probability measures. Namely, let {Pn} and {Qn} be two fixed sequences of probability measures.

The weak convergence Pn - Qn  →  0 with respect to CBL implies the weak convergence with respect to [formula].

Next, we consider classes of functions on which weak convergence is uniform.

Uniform convergence

In Dudley [\cite=dudley1], it was shown that in the traditional setup, weak convergence is uniform on any class of functions f with uniformly bounded norms [formula] and [formula]. More precisely, consider the metric

[formula]

In [\cite=dudley1], it was proved that the weak convergence Pn  →  P w. r. t. C, is equivalent to the convergence β(Pn,P)  →  0.

We establish a similar property in the generalized setup and for arbitrary classes of functions with a fixed order of their moduli of continuity.

For [formula], we define its modulus of continuity

[formula]

Let ω(h) be a fixed non-decreasing function on [formula], such that ω(h)  →  0 as h  →  0. Set

[formula]

(Usually, h = O(ω(h)), and one can write just ωf(h) = O(ω(h)). However, there are situations when ω(h) even equals zero for sufficiently small h's; for example, if [formula] with the usual metric.)

The next proposition, having its intrinsic value, plays an essential role in proving Theorem [\ref=th1].

Let

[formula]

for all f∈Cω, and let

[formula]

Then

[formula]

Clearly, instead of the above class Fω, one may consider a class of uniformly bounded (not necessarily by one) functions f such that ωf(h)  ≤  k1ω(h) + k2h, where k1,  k2 are fixed constants. (Such a formal generalization follows from ([\ref=new03]) just by replacing ω(h) by k1ω(h) + k2h.)

If ([\ref=new02]) is true for all f∈CBL, then

[formula]

for any class F of uniformly bounded functions with uniformly bounded Lipschitz constants.

If ([\ref=new02]) is true for all [formula], then ([\ref=new04]) is true for any class F of uniformly bounded and uniformly equicontinuous functions.

To derive the above corollaries from Theorem [\ref=th4], one should set [formula]. (In the literature, there is no unity in definitions of equicontinuity: some authors define it pointwise; in other definitions, the word "uniformly" is redundant. When talking about uniform equicontinuity, we mean that the function ωF(h) is bounded and vanishing at the origin.)

Proofs

Proofs of Theorems [\ref=th1] and [\ref=th3] essentially use Corollary [\ref=cor1] Theorem [\ref=th4] and Theorem [\ref=th2]. We start with a proof of the latter theorem - the main assertions of this theorem, A and B, are known ([\cite=dudley1]), and the rest of the proof is short. The proof of Theorem [\ref=th4] is relegated to the last Section [\ref=sec.sup].

Proofs of Theorems [\ref=th1] - [\ref=th3]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=th2]

To justify Property C, consider the r.v.'s Xn,Yn defined in Property B. We have |f(Xn) - f(Yn)|  ≤  ωf(ρ(Xn,Yn)). Consequently, [formula], and it suffices to appeal to Property A.

Property D is obvious. Now, let r1(  ·  ,  ·  ) and r2(  ·  ,  ·  )  be two metrics with Properties A-B. If r1(Pn,Q  n)  →  0, then there exist Xn,  Yn for which ρ(Xn,Yn)  →  0, and hence by Property A, r2(Pn,Q  n)  →  0. [formula]

For proving Theorems [\ref=th1] and [\ref=th3], we need

Two lemmas

If π(Pn,Q  n)  →  0, then

[formula]

for any class F of uniformly bounded and uniformly equicontinuous functions.

Proof. By Theorem [\ref=th2], there exist Xn,Yn such that PXn = Pn, Qn = PYn, and [formula].  By conditions of the lemma, [formula], and ω(h): =  sup f∈Fωf(h)  →  0 as h  →  0. For any ε > 0,

[formula]

Hence,

[formula]

(Dudley [\cite=dudley1]). Suppose ([\ref=new05]) is true for [formula]. Then π(Pn,Q  n)  →  0.

Proof. In [\cite=dudley1], the proof of this fact is based on the relation [formula], which is proved separately. For the completeness of the picture, we give a direct proof (which, in essence, is very close to the reasoning in [\cite=dudley1]).

For a closed set K, and an ε > 0, set

[formula]

(Here, Kε is the ε-neighborhood of K.)

Since [formula], the family {IεK(x):K is closed[formula]. Clearly, if ([\ref=new05]) holds for F  =  F1, then it holds for F  =  Fε for any ε > 0. Therefore,

[formula]

for any ε > 0 as n  →    ∞  .

On the other hand,

[formula]

From ([\ref=new06]) and ([\ref=new2]), it follows that for sufficiently large n,

[formula]

which implies that π(Pn,Qn)  ≤  ε. Since ε is arbitrary small, this means that π(Pn,Qn)  →  0. [formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=th1]

The implication π(Pn,Qn)  →  0 ⇒   [formula] for any [formula], immediately follows from Lemma [\ref=lemma2].

Assume [formula] for any [formula]. Then, the same is true for all f∈CBL.

Hence, by Corollary [\ref=cor1] from Theorem [\ref=th4], relation ([\ref=new05]) holds for F  =  F1 (defined in Lemma [\ref=lemma2+]). This implies the convergence π(Pn,Q  n)  →  0 by virtue of Lemma [\ref=lemma2+]. [formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=th3]

Let [formula] for any f∈CBL.

As was proved in Section [\ref=sec.proof1] above, π(Pn,Q  n)  →  0. By virtue of Theorem [\ref=th1], this implies that [formula] for all [formula]. [formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=th4]

Three more lemmas

For any two functions f and g,

[formula]

provided that the l.-h.sides are finite.

Proof is straightforward and very close to that in [\cite=dudley1] dealing with Lipschitz functions. [formula]

Next, for a function f(x), a set K, and a number t > 0, we define the function

[formula]

Let f be a bounded uniformly continuous function. Then

[formula]

and for any h  ≥  0,

[formula]

Proof. Bound ([\ref=l31]) is obvious. Next, note that for any x  and y,

[formula]

(Indeed, for any z∈K,

[formula]

which implies that ρ(x,K)  ≤  ρ(x,y) + ρ(y,K). We can also switch x and y.)

Thus, for qt(x): = 1 - ρ(x,K) / t, we have

[formula]

Together with ([\ref=new071]), this implies ([\ref=l32]). [formula]

Note that, in particular, from Lemma [\ref=lemma3] it follows that if f is uniformly continuous, so does f(t)K.

Let the signed measure Ψn = Pn - Qn.

Suppose

[formula]

for any [formula]. Let F be a class of uniformly bounded and uniformly equicontinuous functions. Set

[formula]

Then for any compact K, and t > 0,

[formula]

Proof. By the Arzelà-Ascoli theorem, for any ε > 0, there is a finite family {f1,...,fd}  ⊂  F such that for any f∈F, there exists s = s(f)∈{1,...,d}, for which

[formula]

On the other hand, for any z∈K, and x∈Kt,

[formula]

Hence, for x∈Kt,

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

Since

[formula]

and ε is arbitrary small, this implies ([\ref=p0]). [formula]

We turn to

A direct proof of Theorem [\ref=th4]

Consider a fixed function ω(h), and the class F  =  Fω from the statement of Theorem [\ref=th4]. Assume that there exist a sequence {f1,f2,...    }  ⊂  F, a sequence {mk}, and a δ > 0, such that [formula] for all k = 1,2,...    . Without loss of generality we can identify {mk} with [formula], and write just

[formula]

We may also assume that for all k's,

[formula]

Now, let t and ε  ≤  t be two fixed positive numbers to be chosen later. Let n1 = 1, and K1 be a compact such that

[formula]

(Here the measure |Ψ|(dx) is the variation of Ψ(dx), and [formula] is the complement of K.)

Let n2  ≥  n1 + 1 be a number such that for all n  ≥  n2

[formula]

and

[formula]

Inequality ([\ref=p5]) is true for sufficiently large n because f(ε / 3)1,K1 is uniformly continuous due to Lemma [\ref=lemma3], and ([\ref=p6]) holds for large n by virtue of ([\ref=p0]). Note also that in ([\ref=p6]) we deal with the supremum over a class of functions, while ([\ref=p5]) concerns only one fixed function.

Next, we consider a compact K2 such that K2  ⊃  K1, and

[formula]

Let us set 1 = f1, and

[formula]

By virtue of ([\ref=p6]),

[formula]

Also,

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=lemma3],

[formula]

Now, we set L1 = K1, and [formula]. Let

[formula]

By construction,

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=lemma3],

[formula]

Now, since the sets Lε / 31 and Lε / 32 are disjoint, in ([\ref=p61]), either g1(x) or (ε / 3)2,L2(x)      equals zero. So, we can also write that g2(x) =  max {g1(x),    (ε / 3)2,L2(x)}. Then, from Lemma [\ref=lemma5], Lemma [\ref=lemma3], ([\ref=p163]), and ([\ref=p611]), it follows that

[formula]

In view of ([\ref=p163]), bound ([\ref=p612]) is true for both functions, g1 and g2.

Thus, both functions, g1 and g2, are bounded and uniformly continuous (since ε,t > 0 are fixed).

Next, we choose n3  ≥  n2 + 1 such that for all n  ≥  n3,

[formula]

and

[formula]

Let K3 be a compact such that K3  ⊃  K2, and

[formula]

We define a function

[formula]

which has properties similar to those of 2, and we define the set

[formula]

The sets Lε / 31, Lε / 32, and Lε / 33 are mutually disjoint. We set

[formula]

and again note that in ([\ref=p62]), either g2(x) or (ε / 3)2,L3(x)   equals zero. Similarly to what we did above, we conclude that ([\ref=p612]) is true for g3 also. So, g3(x) is fixed, uniformly continuous, and g3(x) = 0 for [formula].

Continuing the recurrence procedure in the same fashion, we come to the following objects.

and

gm(x) = 0 for [formula], and

Let

[formula]

Clearly, 0  ≤  g(x)  ≤  1, and

[formula]

Since the numbers ε and t are fixed, the function g∈Cω. We show that, nevertheless, one can choose ε and t such that [formula].

To make exposition simpler, we replace the sequence {nm} by [formula], write Ψn instead of Ψnm, and remove [formula] from [formula]'s. All of this cannot cause misunderstanding.

By virtue of ([\ref=n2]),

[formula]

For [formula], we write

[formula]

Now,

[formula]

By construction, J1n = 0. For the second integral, we have

[formula]

in view of ([\ref=n0]).

By construction, g(x) = gn - 1(x) for x∈Kε / 3n - 1. So,

[formula]

by virtue of ([\ref=n22]).

In view of ([\ref=n11]) and ([\ref=n12]),

[formula]

Thus,

[formula]

To evaluate Jn3, first note that if [formula], then x∈Kεn - 1, and hence

[formula]

Now, let us observe that if [formula] and x∉Lε / 3n, then g(x) = 0. So,

[formula]

On the other hand, [formula], and g(x)  ≤  fn(x) on [formula]. Thus, for the function g, we have the bound similar to ([\ref=n7]), and

[formula]

Combining the bounds above, we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

because we choose ε  ≤  t. Without loss of generality we can take t < 1. Let ε = t2. Then

[formula]

Clearly, one can choose t for which [formula] for all n. [formula]
