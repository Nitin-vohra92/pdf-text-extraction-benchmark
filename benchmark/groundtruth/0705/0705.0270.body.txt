Roughness induced boundary slip in microchannel flows

In microfluidic systems the surface to volume ratio is large causing boundary effects to be significantly more important than in macroscopic devices. Since even on atomic or molecular scales a perfectly smooth surface is an idealized model, the shape of the boundary is an important property. Additionally, it is of technological interest to design surfaces with well defined structures and properties [\cite=stroock-etal-02] [\cite=joseph-etal-06]. A commonly investigated surface property is the apparent slip originating for example from the surface wettability, electrostatic interactions, impurities, or surface structuring [\cite=neto-etal-05]. Navier characterized hydrodynamic slip by postulating that the fluid velocity v(x) at the boundary (x = 0) is proportional to the shear rate [formula] and the slip length β [\cite=navier-23]. For macroscopic systems the simple no-slip boundary condition (β = 0) is a valid assumption. However, if the height of surface variations is not small compared to typical length scales of the system, the position of the boundary is not clearly defined and experiments might detect slip due to not accurately determined wall positions. The influence of roughness on the slip length β has been investigated by numerous authors. Roughness leads to higher drag forces and thus to no slip on macroscopic scales, as shown by Richardson [\cite=richardson-73] and Jansons [\cite=jansons-87]. This was experimentally demonstrated by McHale and Newton [\cite=mchale-newton-04]. Jabbarzadeh et al. performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of Couette flow between sinusoidal walls and found that slip appears for roughness amplitudes smaller than the molecular length scale [\cite=jabbarzadeh-etal-00]. Also, roughness can cause pockets to be filled with vapor or gas nano bubbles leading to apparent slip [\cite=du-goubaidoulline-johansmann-04] [\cite=joseph-etal-06]. Recently, Sbragaglia et al. applied the lattice Boltzmann (LB) method to simulate fluids in the vicinity of microstructured hydrophobic surfaces [\cite=sbragaglia-06] and Varnik et al. [\cite=varnik-dorner-raabe-06] have shown that even in small geometries rough channel surfaces can cause flow to become turbulent. A common setup to measure slip is to utilize a modified atomic force microscope (AFM) to oscillate a colloidal sphere in the vicinity of a boundary [\cite=bib:vinogradova-95] [\cite=bonaccurso-03] [\cite=vinogradova-yakubov-06]. Vinogradova and Yakubov demonstrated that assuming a wrong position of the surface during measurements can lead to substantial errors in the determined slip lengths [\cite=vinogradova-yakubov-06]. They showed that measurements can be interpreted by assuming a modified sphere radius instead of Navier's slip condition, so that the position of a no slip wall would be between peaks and valleys of the rough surface. In this paper we follow this idea. We answer the question at which distinct position the "effective boundary" has to be placed and study the influence of a wrongly determined wall position numerically.

Panzer et al. gave an analytical equation for β for small cosine-shaped surface variations [\cite=panzer-liu-einzel-92]. It is applicable to two infinite planes separated by a distance 2d being much larger than the highest peaks h max. Surface variations are determined by peaks of height h max, valleys at h min and given by h(z) = h max / 2 + h max / 2 cos (qz). Here, q is the wave number and the corresponding slip length is found to be

[formula]

Higher order terms cannot easily be calculated analytically and are neglected. Thus, Eq. [\ref=eq:panzer] is valid only for k = qh max / 2  ≪  1. However, for realistic surfaces, k can become substantially larger than 1 causing the theoretical approach to fail. Here, only numerical simulations can be applied to describe arbitrary boundaries.

We use a 3D LB model as presented in [\cite=succi-01] [\cite=bib:jens-harvey-chin-venturoli-coveney:2005] [\cite=harting-kunert-herrmann-06] to simulate pressure driven flow between two infinite rough walls. Previously, we applied the method to study flows of simple fluids and complex mixtures containing surfactant in hydrophobic microchannels [\cite=harting-kunert-herrmann-06] [\cite=bib:jens-kunert:2007a]. Here, we only shortly describe our method and refer to the literature for details. The lattice Boltzmann equation, [formula], with [formula], describes the time evolution of the single-particle distribution [formula], indicating the amount of quasi particles with velocity [formula], at site [formula] on a 3D lattice of coordination number b = 19, at time-step t. We choose the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook collision operator [formula], with mean collision time τ and equilibrium distribution ηeqi [\cite=harting-kunert-herrmann-06] [\cite=succi-01]. Simulation lattices are 256 lattice units long in flow direction and the planes are separated by 62 sites. Periodic boundary conditions are imposed in the remaining direction allowing us to keep the resolution as low as 16 lattice units. A pressure gradient is obtained as described in [\cite=harting-kunert-herrmann-06]. An effective boundary position can be found by fitting the parabolic flow profile

[formula]

via the distance 2d = 2deff. β is set to 0 here and viscosity μ as well as pressure gradient [formula] are given by the simulation. To obtain an average value for deff, a sufficient number of individual profiles at different positions z are taken into account. Alternatively, the mass flow [formula] can be computed to obtain 2deff. Both methods are equivalent and produce identical results. The so found deff gives the position of the effective boundary and the effective height heff of the rough surface is then defined by d - deff (see Fig. [\ref=fig:hydrodynamicwall]). As rough model surfaces we choose a randomly generated roughness and three periodic ones for which the average height or average roughness Ra is given by h max / 2. Cosine-shaped boundaries are given by h(x) = h max / 2 + h max / 2 cos (qx), squares have a height of h max and are separated by h max lattice sites. Triangular structures are 2h max wide and have a height of h max (see Fig. [\ref=fig:profile]). Randomly generated surface structures are created by choosing for every lattice position of the boundary the height h(x) as a random integer number between 0 and h max. For determining heff we average over five surfaces generated with different sequences of uniformly distributed random numbers. All wall types are geometrically similar, i.e., the effective height heff scales linearly with h max.

In Fig. [\ref=fig:sinus01] the effective height heff obtained from our simulations is plotted versus Ra for cosine shaped surfaces with [formula] (symbols). Lines are given by the analytical solution of Eq. [\ref=eq:panzer]. For k < 1 the simulated data agrees within 2.5% with Panzer's prediction. However, for k = 1 a substantial deviation between numerical and analytical solutions can be observed because Eq. [\ref=eq:panzer] is valid for small k only. The inset of Fig. [\ref=fig:sinus01] depicts the ratio of β / h max according to the theory of Panzer. In the case of large k > 1, the theory is not able to correctly reproduce the increase of β with increasing h max anymore. Instead, β / h max becomes smaller again due to missing higher order contributions in Eq. [\ref=eq:panzer]. Our simulations do not suffer from such limitations allowing us to study arbitrarily complex surface geometries.

In Fig. [\ref=fig:random01]a heff is plotted versus Ra for different types of roughness. By performing a linear fit to the data as given by the lines we find for the uniformly distributed roughness that the position of the effective wall is at c = 1.84 times the average height of the roughness Ra = h max / 2 or at 92% of the maximum height h max. For squares and triangular structures we find constants of proportionality of c = 1.90 and c = 1.69 indicating that the shape of the surface variations indeed affects the position of the effective boundary. However, the effect of the shape is small compared the effect of the height of the variations. All surface structures are geometrically similar causing the linear dependence between heff and Ra = h max / 2. When converting our 3D random roughness into a purely 2D structure, the difference in the measured constant of proportionality c is in the range of the error of the fit algorithm. This is a surprising result since in three dimensions the flow can pass sidewise a roughness element. The measured heff is found to be independent of the flow velocity over more than three decades and does not depend on the pressure either, i.e., heff is independent of the Reynolds number.

In reality high pikes on a smooth surface may occur, so that the average roughness Ra is much smaller than the maximum height h max. To observe such cases we simulate a triangle geometry with additional void space a between the roughness elements. As maximum height h max we choose 5 and 10 lattice sites. In similarity to Fig. [\ref=fig:random01] we plot the effective surface height heff over the average roughness Ra in Fig. [\ref=fig:random02]. In this case the average roughness is smaller than the half of h max, i.e., [formula]. The values of h max = 5 are scaled by a factor of 2 to fit them with the values of h max = 10. Due to the geometrical similarity of the surface structure this scaling is possible. For comparison with Fig. [\ref=fig:random01]a the linear fit with slope c = 1.69 is plotted. In Fig. [\ref=fig:random01]b we see that the maximum height has the strongest influence on the effective height heff and not the distance a. For small Ra created by a large additional distance a, heff converges to zero corresponding to a flat surface. For small a the data converges to the triangle geometry as given in Fig. [\ref=fig:random01]a. For a medium a  ≈  2h max the effective wall is still in the range of 75% of the maximum height h max. This is an important result, since it demonstrates that the distance between heff and h min can be much larger than Ra and that in such cases heff > 6  ·  Ra can be obtained. On the other hand, for large a this results in heff < 0.7  ·  h max. Therefore, in the case of large a  ≈  2h max, the effective wall heff cannot be approximated by the maximum height h max nor by the average roughness Ra.

We obtained AFM data of a gold coated glass surface with a maximum peak to valley distance of 64nm. The sample size is 1μm2 represented by 512  ×  512 data points. A lattice constant of the LB simulation can be scaled to 1.9nm by setting the relaxation time τ to 1.15 and by mapping the speed of sound and the viscosity to the values for water ([formula], [formula]). heff can then be measured as in previous paragraphs of this paper by loading the AFM data onto our simulation lattice. For the simulations presented in this paragraph, the channel width is set to 128 lattice units. The simulated effective height of the gold surface is depicted by the square at Ra=21nm in Fig. [\ref=fig:zweifl]. Data points at Ra = 4 and 8 are obtained by downscaling the original data set. We find that the distribution of surface heights follows a Gaussian distribution and use this distribution to generate an artificial random surface with identical height distribution. In contrast to the AFM data, our data points are fully uncorrelated, while the gold surface shows distinct structural properties as can be observed in the background images of Fig. [\ref=fig:zweifl]. For artificial surfaces, the average roughness Ra can be scaled by scaling the width of the distribution of random numbers allowing us to determine heff for Ra up to 40nm. As shown by the dotted line, the measured heff linearly depends on Ra with a constant of proportionality of c = 1.43. The data obtained from the gold coated surface follows the same linear dependence demonstrating that the actual shape of a surface does not influence the effective surface position, but only the distribution of heights needs to be known.

The most important question to be answered by our simulations is the effect of a wrongly assumed position of a surface on experimental measurements. As mentioned in the introduction many groups use an approaching method to measure the slip length β. Here, a colloidal sphere at the tip of a cantilever immersed in a fluid is oscillated in the vicinity of a surface, or the two cylinders of a surface force apparatus (SFA) are brought close to each other. The distance between the surfaces can become very small - even down to contact. To study the influence of the roughness on an apparent slip effect, we assume the surface to be placed at h max as it is commonly done in experiments [\cite=bonaccurso-03]. Then, we measure the slip length β by fitting Eq. [\ref=eq:profil02]. The wrong position of the surface causes a substantial error in the detected slip as can be inferred from Fig. [\ref=fig:random02]. Here, β is given versus Ra for randomly generated boundaries with the heights of the surface obstacles following the Gaussian distribution given by the AFM data of the gold surface. For small Ra (and thus large separation of the plates) β is in the range of h max - heff and can be neglected in most practical cases. However, the detected slip diverges if Ra becomes large and grows to 80nm for Ra = 55nm. Here, a large Ra is equivalent to the channel width becoming very small - an effect also common in typical surface approaching experiments or microchannel flows. For curved surfaces, as they are utilized in surface force apparatuses or AFM based slip measurements, the detected β can be even larger due to higher order components of the flow field. This might explain experiments reporting large slip lengths of β  ≈  100nm [\cite=lauga-brenner-stone-05] [\cite=neto-etal-05].

In conclusion we performed LB simulations of pressure driven flow between two rough plates. By varying the roughness we found that there exists an imaginary effective plane where the no slip boundary condition is valid. We compared our results to analytic calculations of Panzer et al. and found good agreement in the case of small variations (k < 1). Large and more realistic perturbations (k > 1) can only be covered by simulations as presented in this paper. By simulating flow of water along a gold coated surface and a randomly generated one with identical height distribution, we demonstrated that the position of the effective plane is independent of the actual boundary structure and that only the distribution of heights is relevant. We showed that apparent slip due to errornous assumptions of the surface structure can become very large if the distance between the boundaries is small - as it is typical in dynamic microfluidic experiments. Our simulations can be of practical importance for experimental measurements of boundary slip induced for example by electrostatic interactions, surface wettability or impurities. Due to the precise measurements needed, ignoring the influence of surface roughness leads to substantial errors in the determined slip. A simulation of the flow along a surface generated from AFM data allows to determine how an experimentally detected slip might have to be corrected in order to take the surface structure into account.
