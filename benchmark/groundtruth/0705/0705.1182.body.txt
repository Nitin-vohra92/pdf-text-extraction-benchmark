Pure states on free group C*-algebras

NOTATION: For any set R with two or more elements, let FR denote the free group on R with generators {ur:r∈R} and let C*r(FR) denote the reduced group C*-algebra. We won't distinguish between the elements of FR and the corresponding unitary operators in C*r(FR). In what follows, r0 will be a fixed element of R, u will denote the generator ur0 and Fu will denote the subgroup of FR generated by u. We view C*r(FS) as the C*-subalgebra of C*r(FR) generated by the unitaries {us:s∈S} and C*r(Fu) as the C*-subalgebra generated by u. Let Pu (resp. PS) denote the unique trace preserving conditional expectation from C*r(FR) onto C*r(Fu) (respectively C*r(FS)). Recall that C*r(Fu) is *-isomorphic to the *-algebra of continuous complex valued functions on the unit circle, with u going into the function θ(z) = z. Let f0 denote the (unique!) pure state of C*r(Fu) that satisfies f0(u) = 1 and let [formula].

If R is uncountable, then C*r(FR) is inseparable. For Card[formula], the algebra C*r(FR) is discussed in [\cite=pop], where it is shown that C*r(FR) is inseparable, but that every abelian subalgebra is separable. Powers [\cite=pow] showed that for Card(R) = 2,C*r(FR) is simple and has unique trace. Powers' method extends to general R. For general free products of groups, simplicity and uniqueness of trace follow by results of Avitzour [\cite=av]. In [\cite=a] and [\cite=al] the methods of [\cite=ao] were used to extend the simplicity and uniqueness of trace results to a host of other group C*-algebras where free sets lurked in the underlying groups. In [\cite=arch] Rob Archbold also obtained related results.

If S  ⊂  R, Card (S) > 1 and α is a *-automorphism of C*r(FS), then α has an extension to a *-automorphism of C*r(FR).

Check that if [formula] is defined on the *-algebra A generated by C*r(FS) and the generators in [formula] by applying α to elements of C*r(FS) and leaving the other generators alone, then [formula] is a *  -automorphism of A. Every element of C*r(FR) is representable in the form of an element of l2(FR), and the [formula] of such an element is simply the coefficient of the identity. Since the [formula] is unique on C*r(FS) by [\cite=a] (see also [\cite=av]), α preserves the [formula]. Thus it is easy to verify that [formula] preserves the [formula] on A. Again by density of A in l2(FR), for any a∈A and any ε > 0 there exists b∈A such that ||b||2 = 1 and ||ab||2 > ||a|| - ε. So [formula] by invariance of the [formula], and hence [formula] ||ab||2 > ||a|| - ε. Since a similar inequality holds for α- 1, we see that [formula] extend by continuity to an automorphism of C*r(FR).

The state f is the unique state extension of f0 to C*r(FR), and f is a pure state of C*r(FR). Moreover [formula] is pure for any subset S of R that contains r0.

Let g be a state of C*r(FR) such that g(u) = 1. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality applies to show that g((1 - u)a) = g(a(1 - u)) = 0 for any a∈C*r(FR). By induction, g(un) = g(u- n) = 1 for every natural number n. Fix [formula]. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality again, as above, g(unsu- n) = g(s) for every natural number n. Taking ξ to be the canonical trace vector in l2(FR), [formula], where H0 is the closed linear span of all vectors of form wξ with w a reduced word in FR with a non-zero power of u on the left, and H1 is the closed linear span of those wξ with w not ending in a non-zero power of u on the left. Then unH1  ⊂  H0 for any non-zero integer n and sH0  ⊂  H1. By [\cite=choi] (see also [\cite=av])

[formula]

By linearity and continuity of g, this implies that [formula] and hence that g = f. An easy convexity argument shows that f is a pure state.

The conclusion of the last sentence of the Lemma follows immediately from the conclusion of the first sentence.

Let {Gr}r∈R be a set of nontrivial countable groups and for non-empty S  ⊂  R, let GS be the free product ( * r∈SGr). Given a nonempty countable subset S0 of R, if g is a pure state on C*r(GR) there is a countable subset S of R containing S0 such that g|C*r(GS) is a pure state of C*r(GS). Moreover C*r(GS) is separable and also simple if |Gs| > 2 for some s∈S.

Assume without loss of generality that R is uncountable. For any non-empty countable S  ⊂  R, C*r(GS) is separable, and by [\cite=av] simple if |Gs| > 2 for some s∈S. If (πg,Hg,ξg) is the GNS representation of C*r(GR) corresponding to g, sequences of sets

[formula]

with each Si countably infinite, closed separable linear subspaces

[formula]

and, for each i  ≥  2, a countable dense subset Xi of the unit sphere of Hi such that

[formula]

are constructed inductively so that

[formula]

for i  ≥  1. Let S1 be a non-empty countable subset of R containing S0. For the inductive step, given Si and Hi, let Hi + 1 be the closed linear span of πg(C*r(GSi))Hi, which is separable, and let Xi + 1 be a countable dense subset of the unit sphere of Hi + 1 containing Xi. By Kadison's transitivity theorem there is a countable set Ui + 1 of unitaries in C*r(GR) such that for ξ,η∈Xi + 1, πg(u)ξ  =  η for some u∈Ui + 1. Since each such u is a norm-limit of a sequence of finite linear combinations of elements of GR, there is a countable subset S'i + 1 of R such that Ui + 1  ⊂  C*r(GS'i + 1). Let [formula]. Now let

[formula]

Then S and X are countable, H is separable, πg(C*r(GS))H  ⊆  H and X is dense in the unit sphere of H. If ξ,η∈X, then πg(v)ξ  =  η for some unitary v∈C*r(GS). It follows that for any ε  >  0 and unit vectors ξ,η∈H, [formula] for some unitary w∈C*r(GS), which implies that πg(C*r(GS))|H acts irreducibly on H. Since g|C*r(GS) is the state of C*r(GS) corresponding to ξg, g|C*r(GS) is pure.

If R is countable, the conclusion is immediate from [\cite=kos]. Assume that R is uncountable. Let g be a pure state of C*r(FR). We shall show that g is *-automorphism equivalent to f. By Proposition 0.3 there is a countably infinite subset S  ⊂  R such that r0∈S and [formula] is pure. We have already noted that C*r(FS) is simple, and it is obviously separable, so by [\cite=kos] choose a *-automorphism γ0 of C*r(FS) such that g|C*r(FS)  =  γ*0(f|C*r(FS)). By Lemma 0.1, extend γ0 to a *-automorphism γ of C*r(FR). We must show that γ*(f) = g. Lemma 0.2 shows that f|C*r(FS) has unique state extension to C*r(FR). Since γ is a *-automorphism extending γ0, the same uniqueness of state extension must follow for γ*(f|C*r(FS)) = g|C*r(FS). Thus γ*(f) = g.

The next result is in contrast to Corollary 0.9 of [\cite=cn3].

By Theorem 0.4 it suffices to prove this for f. Choose an excising sequence {an} for f0 in C*r(Fu), as defined in [\cite=excising]. Let p  =   lim an in C*r(FR)*  *. By Lemma 0.2, p is a minimal projection there. By [\cite=excising], {an} will excise f and {1 - an} will be an approximate unit for {a∈C*r(FR):f(a*a + aa*) = 0}, so [formula] is strictly positive there.

1. By Theorem 0.4, any pure state of C*r(FS) is *-automorphism equivalent to f|C*r(FS), and thus has the unique extension property since Lemma 0.2 shows that f|C*r(FS) has that property.

2. If there were another conditional expectation Q:C*r(FR)  →  C*r(FS) distinct from PS, then the duals Q* and P*S would have to be different on some element of C*r(FS)*, hence on some state of C*r(FS), hence on some pure state of C*r(FS) by the Krein Milman Theorem [\cite=kr]. This is impossible by part 1 of this theorem.

Concluding Remarks. 1. A very similar proof to that of Proposition 3 shows the related result that if B is a separable C*-subalgebra of an inseparable C*-algebra A, then if g is a pure state of A, there is a separable C*-subalgebra C of A such that B  ⊆  C and g|C is pure. An analogous induction argument shows moreover that if A is simple, then a simple C with these properties can be found.

2. The proof of Theorem 0.4 and the preceding lemmas generalize in an obvious way to the general free product groups GR  =    *  r∈RGr considered in Proposition 0.3, provided that one of the constituent groups Gr0 is abelian with an element of infinite order. Thus any two pure states of C*r(GR) are *-automorphism equivalent. The corresponding generalizations of Theorems 0.5 and 0.6 to these free product groups then follow, with Gr0 taking the place of Fu.
