New experimental findings have been continuously brought by inelastic neutron scattering in cuprate superconductors. In recent years the spin excitation at higher energies than the resonance energy has been intensively discussed[\cite=Levi].

For optimally doped La2SrCuO4 the spectral intensity in [formula]-Ï‰ space has been established experimentally[\cite=LSCO]. In the following we give a phenomenological description of this completely established spectrum on the basis of the itinerant-localized duality model[\cite=MN].

In the study of cuprate superconductors the duality model is effective to understand pseudogap" and spin-charge separation" anomalies[\cite=MN] in the normal phase. Especially the pseudogap" phenomena are understood as a spectral-weight transfer[\cite=MN] [\cite=NM1] [\cite=NM2] [\cite=Narikiyo] [\cite=NM3] from itinerant to localized degrees of freedom. Such a spectral weight transfer is missed in the standard spin-fluctuation theory[\cite=Moriya] where the magnetically ordered phase is metallic. Since the ordered phase is the Mott insulator in the case of cuprates, the itinerant spectral weight representing the metallic component should vanish approaching the Mott transition and the spectral weight transfer from low-energy itinerant to high-energy localized spectral weights is inevitable.

Above mentioned localized part representing the sloppy spin wave[\cite=Narikiyo] [\cite=NM3] is the spin excitation at higher energies than the resonance energy[\cite=Levi] [\cite=LSCO]. This localized part is converted to the spin-wave spectrum in the Mott insulator.

The itinerant-localized crossover[\cite=NM1] [\cite=NM2] [\cite=NM4] resulting from the spectral weight transfer is observed experimentally[\cite=phase-diagram]. The pseudogap at lowest temperature or lowest energy should be ascribed to the superconducting fluctuations[\cite=phase-diagram].
