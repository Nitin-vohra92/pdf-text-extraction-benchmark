The log-normal distribution from Non-Gibrat's law in the middle scale region of profits

PACS code : 89.65.Gh

Introduction

Log-normal distributions are frequently observed not only in natural phenomena but also in social phenomena. For representative example, the probability density function P(x) of personal income or firm size x is considered to obey the log-normal distribution [\cite=Gibrat]-[\cite=Badger]

[formula]

in the middle scale region. Here x̄ is a mean value and σ2 is a variance.

The simplest model which describes the log-normal distribution is the pure multiplicative stochastic process defined by

[formula]

where R(t) is a positive random variable. By applying this process iteratively, we obtain

[formula]

The logarithm of this equation is

[formula]

If log x(0) is negligible compare to log x(t) in the limit t  →    ∞   and

log R(i) [formula] are independent probability variables, log x(t) follows the normal distribution in the limit. As a result, this model derives the stationary log-normal distribution PLN(x).

Eq. ([\ref=MSP]) means that the distribution of the growth rate does not depend on x(t). This is known as Gibrat's law [\cite=Gibrat] that the conditional probability density function of the growth rate Q(R|x1) is independent of the initial value x1:

[formula]

Here x1 and x2 are two successive incomes, assets, sales, profits, the numbers of employees and so forth. The growth rate R is defined as R = x2 / x1 and Q(R|x1) as

[formula]

by using the probability density function P(x1) and the joint probability density function P1R(x1,R).

As far as firm sizes in the middle scale region, however, it is reported that the growth rate distributions do not follow the Gibrat's law ([\ref=Gibrat]) (see Refs. [\cite=Stanley1]-[\cite=Aoyama] for instance). The pure multiplicative stochastic process model ([\ref=MSP]) cannot be applied for explaining the log-normal distribution in the middle scale region. Instead, we have shown that the log-normal distribution can be derived by using no model such as the pure multiplicative stochastic process [\cite=Ishikawa2007]. In the derivation, two laws are employed which are observed in profits data of Japanese firms. One is the law of detailed balance which is observed in a stable economy [\cite=FSAKA]. The other is a Non-Gibrat's law which describes a statistical dependence in the growth rate of the past value [\cite=Ishikawa2007].

In Ref. [\cite=Ishikawa2007], we kinematically derived the static log-normal distribution under the detailed balance, and analyzed empirical data in a single term 2003-2004 to confirm the derivation. In this study, we show data analyses not only in 2003-2004 but also in 2004-2005 and 2003-2005 to confirm the derivation more firmly. After that, we dynamically derive the log-normal distribution by replacing the detailed balance with the detailed quasi-balance proposed in Ref. [\cite=Ishikawa1]. By this procedure, the log-normal distribution is described as quasi-static.

Static log-normal distribution under the detailed balance

In this section, we briefly review the study in Ref. [\cite=Ishikawa2007]. After that, we empirically confirm the analytic result by added data analyses. We employ profits data of Japanese firms in 2003, 2004 and 2005 which are available on the database "CD Eyes 50" published in 2005 and 2006 by TOKYO SHOKO RESEARCH, LTD. [\cite=TSR].

Figure [\ref=logProfit0304DB] shows the joint probability density function P12(x1,x2) of all firms in the database, the profits of which in 2003 (x1)-2004 (x2) exceeded 0, x1 > 0 and x2  >  0. The number of the firms is "227,132". Similarly, figures [\ref=logProfit0405DB]-[\ref=logProfit0305DB] show the joint probability density functions of the profits in 2004 (x1)-2005 (x2) and 2003 (x1)-2005 (x2), and the number of the firms is "232,497" and "197,867", respectively. From Figs. [\ref=logProfit0304DB]-[\ref=logProfit0305DB], we approximately confirm the detailed balance which is time-reversal symmetry (x1  ↔  x2) of P12(x1,x2) [\cite=FSAKA]:

[formula]

Figure [\ref=DistributionData] shows probability density functions of profits in 2003-2005. The distributions are almost stable and following power-law is observed in the large scale region

[formula]

where x0 is a certain threshold. This power-law is called Pareto's law [\cite=Pareto] and the exponent μ is named Pareto index. Notice that Pareto's law does not hold below the threshold x0. The purpose of this section is to exhibit the distribution in the middle scale region under the detailed balance ([\ref=Detailed_balance]).

In order to identify a statistical dependence in the growth rate of the past value, we examine the probability density faction of the profits growth rate in 2003-2004 firstly. In the database, we divide the range of x1 into logarithmically equal bins as x1∈4  ×  [101  +  0.2(n  -  1),101  +  0.2n] thousand yen with [formula]. Figure [\ref=ProfitGrowthRate0304] shows the probability density functions for r  =   log 10R in the case of [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula]. The number of the firms in Fig. [\ref=ProfitGrowthRate0304] is "22,005", "89,507", "85,020" and "24,203", respectively.

From Fig. [\ref=ProfitGrowthRate0304], we approximate log 10q(r|x1) by linear functions of r:

[formula]

Here q(r|x1) is the probability density function for r, which is related to that for R by Q(R|x1)  =   log 10q(r|x1)  -  r  -   log 10( ln 10). These approximations ([\ref=approximation1])-([\ref=approximation2]) are expressed as tent-shaped exponential forms as follows

[formula]

where d(x1) = 10c(x1)  /  ln 10. Furthermore, figure [\ref=ProfitGrowthRate0304] shows that the dependence of c(x1) on x1 is negligible for [formula] . We assess the validity of these approximations against the results.

Figure [\ref=eGibrat0304] represents the dependence of t±(x1) on the lower bound of each bin x1  =  4  ×  101 + 0.2(n - 1). For [formula], t±(x1) hardly responds to x1. This means that Gibrat's law ([\ref=Gibrat]) holds only in the large scale region of profits (x  >  x0). In contrast, t+(x1) linearly increases and t-(x1) linearly decreases symmetrically with log 10x1 for [formula] . From Fig. [\ref=eGibrat0304], the slops are described as [\cite=Ishikawa3]

[formula]

The parameters are estimated as follows: α  ~  0 for x1  >  x0, α  ~  0.14 for x min  <  x1  <  x0, x0  =  4  ×  101 + 0.2(17 - 1)  ~  63,000 thousand yen and x min  =  4  ×  101 + 0.2(9 - 1)  ~  1,600 thousand yen. Notice that approximations ([\ref=approximation1])-([\ref=approximation2]) uniquely fix the expression of t±(x1) under the detailed balance [\cite=Ishikawa2007]. This derivation is included in the proof in the next section. We call Eqs.([\ref=tent-shaped1])-([\ref=t0]) Non-Gibrat's law.

For [formula], the dependence of d(x1) on x1 is negligible. In this case, the Non-Gibrat's law determines the probability density function of profits as follows

[formula]

where t+(x0)  -  t-(x0)  ~  μ [\cite=Ishikawa0]. This is the power-law in the large scale region (x1  >  x0) and the log-normal distribution in the middle scale region (x min  <  x1  <  x0). The relations between parameters σ, x̄ in Eq. ([\ref=LN]) and α, μ, x0 are given by

[formula]

Figure [\ref=Distribution0304-03] shows that the distribution ([\ref=HandM]) fits with the empirical data consistently. Notice that the distribution cannot fit with the empirical data, if α is different from the value estimated in Fig. [\ref=eGibrat0304] (α  =  0.10 or α  =  0.20 for instance).

These empirical data analyses are not restricted in the single term 2003-2004. Figures [\ref=ProfitGrowthRate0405]-[\ref=Distribution0405-04] show similar empirical data analyses in 2004-2005. The number of the firms in Fig. [\ref=ProfitGrowthRate0405] is "20,669", "89,064", "88,651" and "26,887", respectively. Furthermore, empirical data analyses in 2003-2005 are shown in Figs. [\ref=ProfitGrowthRate0305]-[\ref=Distribution0305-03]. The number of the firms in Fig. [\ref=ProfitGrowthRate0305] is "18,101", "76,050", "75,451" and "22,456", respectively. In Figs. [\ref=eGibrat0405], [\ref=eGibrat0305], the parameters α, x0 and x min in 2004-2005 or 2003-2005 are estimated to be same values in 2003-2004. The distribution ([\ref=HandM]) in 2004-2005 or 2003-2005 also fits with the empirical data consistently (Figs. [\ref=Distribution0405-04], [\ref=Distribution0305-03]).

Quasi-static log-normal distribution under the detailed quasi-balance

In the previous section, the log-normal distribution in the middle scale region is exhibited by the Non-Gibrat's law under the detailed balance. The resultant profits distribution is empirically confirmed in data analyses of Japanese firms in 2003-2004, 2004-2005 and 2003-2005. The profits distribution ([\ref=HandM]) is static, because the derivation is based on the detailed balance ([\ref=Detailed_balance]) which is static time-reversal symmetry (Fig. [\ref=logProfit0304DB]-[\ref=logProfit0305DB]).

On the other hand, we have derived Pareto's law with annually varying Pareto index under the detailed quasi-balance [\cite=Ishikawa1]:

[formula]

It is assumed that, in the quasi-static system, the joint probability density function has "a ~ x1θ  ↔  x2" symmetry where θ is a slope of a regression line:

[formula]

The detailed balance ([\ref=Detailed_balance]) has the special symmetry θ  =  a  =  1. Because the detailed quasi-balance ([\ref=Detailed_quasi-balance]) is imposed on the system, θ is related to a as follows:

[formula]

Here 10Γ is a sufficient large value compared to the upper bound in which θ and a are estimated.

In Ref. [\cite=Ishikawa1], these results have been empirically confirmed by employing data on the assessed value of land [\cite=Kaizoji]-[\cite=Web] in 1983-2005. In the derivation, we have used the Gibrat's law ([\ref=Gibrat]) valid only in the large scale region without linear approximations ([\ref=approximation1])-([\ref=approximation2]). The purpose of this section is to show that the approximations uniquely fix a Non-Gibrat's law under the detailed quasi-balance. After that, we identify the quasi-static distribution not only in the large scale region but also in the middle scale region.

By using the relation P12(x1,x2)dx1dx2  =  P1R(x1,R)dx1dR under the change of variables (x1,x2) ↔  (x1,R), these two joint probability density functions are related to each other

[formula]

where we use a modified growth rate R = x2 / (a ~ x1θ) . From this relation, the detailed quasi-balance ([\ref=Detailed_quasi-balance]) is rewritten as

[formula]

Substituting P1R(x1,R) for Q(R|x1) defined in Eq. ([\ref=define]), the detailed quasi-balance is reduced to be

[formula]

In the quasi-static system, we also assume that Q(R|x1) follows the tent-shaped exponential forms ([\ref=tent-shaped1])-([\ref=tent-shaped2]). Under the approximations, the detailed quasi-balance is expressed as

[formula]

for R > 1. Here we use the notation P̃(x) = P(x)d(x). By expanding Eq.([\ref=Detailed_quasi-balance_2]) around R = 1, the following differential equation is obtained:

[formula]

where x denotes x1. The same equation is obtained for R < 1. The solution is expressed as

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] .

In order to make the solution ([\ref=solution]) around R = 1 satisfy Eq. ([\ref=Detailed_quasi-balance_2]), the following equation must be valid for all R:

[formula]

The derivative of this equation with respect to x is

[formula]

By expanding Eq. ([\ref=derivative]) around R = 1, the following differential equations are obtained:

[formula]

The solutions are given by

[formula]

In order to make these solutions satisfy Eq. ([\ref=DE2]), the coefficients C- 2 and C+ 1 must be 0 . As a result, t±(x) under the detailed quasi-balance is uniquely fixed as

[formula]

This is the same expression under the detailed balance.

By using the Non-Gibrat's law ([\ref=t]), probability density functions P1(x1), P2(x2) are uniquely reduced to be

[formula]

with

[formula]

in the large or middle scale region where the dependence of d(x1) on x1 is negligible.

Here we consider two log-normal distributions in the middle scale region:

[formula]

By comparing Eqs. ([\ref=HandM1])-([\ref=HandM2]) to ([\ref=LN1])-([\ref=LN2]), we identify

[formula]

Consequently, the relation between σ1, σ2 and θ is expressed as

[formula]

This is the equation which quasi-static log-normal distributions satisfy.

Conclusion

In this study, by employing profits data of Japanese firms, we have exhibited the static log-normal distribution of profits in the middle scale region from a Non-Gibrat's law under the detailed balance. In the derivation, we have adopted two approximations observed in the database. One is that the probability density function of the profits growth rate is described as a tent-shaped exponential function. The other is that the value of the origin of the growth rate distribution divided into bins is constant. These approximations are confirmed in 2003-2004, 2004-2005 and 2003-2005. The resultant profits distribution fits with the empirical data consistently. This guarantees the validity of the approximations.

This static discussion has been applied to a quasi-static system. We have derived a quasi-static log-normal distribution in the middle scale region from a Non-Gibrat's law under the detailed quasi-balance. In the derivation, we have also assumed two approximations confirmed in the database. Even in the quasi-static system, the approximations uniquely fix the Non-Gibrat's law to be the same expression under the detailed balance. The resultant distribution is power-law with varying Pareto index in the large scale region and the quasi-static log-normal distribution in the middle scale region. Notice that not only the change of Pareto index μ but also the change of the variance of the log-normal distribution σ depends on a parameter of the detailed quasi-balance θ. In other words, μ and σ are related to each other. This phenomenon is suggested in Ref. [\cite=Souma].

First issue in the future is to confirm this quasi-static derivation by data analyses. For this aim, long-term economic data must be investigated in the middle scale region where dynamical transitions are observed. We believe that the analytic results in this study are confirmed in such a database, if two approximations assumed in this paper are applicable.
