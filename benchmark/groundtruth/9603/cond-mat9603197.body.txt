Let us consider an example which allows us to discuss simultaneously the vortices in superconductors and Fermi superfluids, and magnetic vortices and skyrmions in ferromagnets. This is quantized vortex line with continuous structure, 3 types of such vortices have been experimentally investigated in superfluid 3He-A [\cite=AphDiag]. Such vortices can arise in a wide class of systems, where superfluid (superconducting) correlations are accompanied by spontaneous orbital or spin momentum. The system is characterized by fractional number [formula] which shows the nominal value of the angular momentum per particle. For 3He-A the momentum is [formula] per Cooper pair, ie [formula], while for QHE [formula], where ν is the filling factor and N is the number of particles [\cite=Read]. Due fermionic degrees of freedom the dynamical angular momentum can deviate from its nominal value [formula], where [formula] is the direction of spontaneous momentum. This is the so called angular momentum paradox. In 3He-A [formula], where C0 = p3F / 3π2 and V the volume [\cite=Exotic]. The difference between particle density ρ = N / V and C0 comes from the particle-hole asymmetry near the Fermi-surface: in systems with weak interaction it is small but in strongly correlated systems it can be large.

Continuous vortex. We consider the following [formula]-texture without singularity

[formula]

where r,z,φ are cylindrical coordinates and η(0) is 0 or π. The [formula]-vector in this texture covers the area s = 4π( cos η(  ∞  ) -  cos η(0)) on unit sphere   ·   = 1. We are interested in the textures with s = 2πn, where n is integer. If n  ≠  0 there is a circulation of superfluid velocity [formula] around the texture at infinity: [formula], as follows from the Mermin-Ho relation [\cite=Mermin-Ho] (m is the bare mass of the fermion). So the texture represents the continuous vortex with circulation [formula]. In 3He-A these are Mermin-Ho (n = 1) and Anderson-Toulouse (n = 2) vortices.

There are three nondissipative forces acting on the vortex [\cite=KopninVolovik], which correspond to three velocities involved: the velocity [formula] of the vortex; superfluid velocity [formula] far outside the vortex; and the velocity [formula] of the heat bath (in superconductors and ferromagnets this is the velocity of the crystal, in superfluids it is the velocity of the normal component).

Magnus force [formula] is the force between the vortex and the superfluid vacuum.

Iordanskii force [formula] arises due to the Aharonov-Bohm effect experienced by the quasiparticles [\cite=Sonin1975], where ρn is the density of the normal component of the system.

Spectral-flow force comes from the spectral flow of fermions through the gap nodes. As distinct from the most of superfluid/superconductor systems, where the gap nodes appear only in the core of singular vortices, in 3He-A the point gap nodes exist everywhere in the bulk liquid. Due to nodes the effect of axial anomaly takes place, resulting in the transfer of the linear momentum from coherent degrees of freedom (texture) through the nodes to the heat bath. The momentum flow occurs with the rate [\cite=Exotic]:

[formula]

Here [formula] simulates the vector-potential, which acts on quasiparticles in vicinity of gap nodes. Integration of Eq.(2) over the cross-section of the moving vortex[\cite=HydrodynamicAction] gives an anomalous spectral-flow force:

[formula]

Here C0 is the same parameter as in the angular momentum paradox. The balance of the three forces together with friction force [formula] governs the low-frequency dynamics of continuous vortex.

Singular vortices. The singular vortex in s-wave superconductor or in p-wave 3He-B can be obtained from the continuous one in the following way. Let us take an equal mixture of two states with [formula] and [formula], then the net momentum in bulk superfluid/superconductor is zero and the gap nodes cancel each other. Now, if in each state there is a continuous vortex with the same [formula], this corresponds to the vortex in the mixture with winding number n. The core of this vortex is the region where the two states do not cancel each other, because they have opposite s, and where the gap nodes survive. By shrinking this region to the coherence length size one obtains the singular vortex. This procedure just reflects the core structure of the 3He-B vortex [\cite=SalomaaVolovik1987].

Since the quantity [formula] remains the same in this procedure, one may conclude that all three nondissipative forces remain intact even for singular vortex. The situation is however more complicated. The anomaly equation (2) assumes the continuous approximation, which is valid if the discreteness of the fermionic levels in the core [\cite=Caroli] is neglected. The condition for this is ω0τ  ≪  1, where ω0 is the interlevel distance and τ is the life-time [\cite=KopninVolovik]. This is the so called "hydrodynamical" regime. So, for vortices in dirty superconductors, which like the continuous vortices in 3He-A are in the hydrodynamical regime, the spectral flow is so strong that it nearly cancels the Magnus force. This means that the Hall conductivity, which is proportional to ρ - C0, is nonzero only due to small particle-hole asymmetry [\cite=KopninVolovik] [\cite=vanOtterlo]. Possibly the same approximate particle-hole symmetry [\cite=MakhlinVolovik] leads to cancellation of Magnus force observed in Josephson junction arrays [\cite=vanZant1995].

If ω0τ is not small the spectral flow of fermions in the core is suppressed, the force [formula] is modified and finally disappears in the opposite "collisionless" limit ω0τ  ≫  1. The parameter ω0τ is a strong function of the temperature T, this leads to the T-dependence of the spectral-flow force[\cite=KopninVolovik], which reproduces the experimental T-dependence of the nondissipative force acting on the vortex in 3He-B [\cite=Bevan1995]. The microscopic derivation of this temperature dependence has been done many years ago using the Green's function formalism [\cite=KopninCoAuthors].

Magnetic vortices and skyrmions in ferromagnets. Interest to these defects is renewed because they can represent a new type of elementary excitations in QHE (see eg [\cite=Stone] [\cite=ReadSachdev]). This can be either the cylindrical domain in the easy axis ferromagnet or 2π vortex in the easy plane ferromagnet. Such defects can be obtained from the continuous vortex in Eq.(1) by cancellation of the superfluid/superconductor long-range order. If superfluidity is absent, one has ρn  =  ρ and the superfluid velocity drops out from the total nondissipative force: [formula] or

[formula]

Thus the nondissipative force on the magnetic vortex (s = 2π) and on the skyrmion (s = 4π), is completely determined by the angular momentum density L and by the area s covered by the magnetization on unit sphere. This is in agreement with the analysis in [\cite=SoninNikiforov] [\cite=FerroWessZumino] [\cite=Stone] [\cite=Kuratsuji]. However due to the anomalies in the fermionic system, the effective L is the dynamical one, [formula]. One may expect that this corresponds to the "hydrodynamical" regime, while in "collisionless" regime the nominal value of the angular momentum [formula] is to be restored.
