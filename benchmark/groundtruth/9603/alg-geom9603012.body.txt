Vanishing theorems for ample vector bundles

Introduction

Since the seminal paper published by P.A. Griffiths in 1969 [\cite=gr], a whole series of vanishing theorems have been established for the Dolbeault cohomology of ample vector bundles on smooth projective varieties, mainly due to the efforts of J. Le Potier, M. Schneider, A. Sommese, J-P. Demailly, L. Ein and R. Lazarsfeld, the author, and more recently W. Nahm [\cite=de1] [\cite=el] [\cite=lp1] [\cite=m1] [\cite=m2] [\cite=na] [\cite=sch] [\cite=so].

This abundance of results and variants lead to a little confusion, in contrast with the case of ample line bundles for which the celebrated Kodaira-Akizuki-Nakano vanishing theorem [\cite=an] is the only general statement.

In this paper, we prove a vanishing theorem for the Dolbeault cohomology of a product of symmetric and skew-symmetric powers of an ample vector bundle, twisted by a suitable power of its determinant line bundle. This line bundle being ample, our theorem can be seen as an effective version, in that particular case, of the asymptotic vanishing theorem of Serre. It includes as special cases most of the above mentionned results.

Theorem A. Let E be a holomorphic vector bundle of rank e, and L a line bundle on a smooth projective complex variety X of dimension n. Suppose that E is ample and L nef, or that E is nef and L ample. Then, for any sequences of integers [formula] and [formula],

[formula]

as soon as [formula].

The vanishing theorem of Griffiths, more precisely the version of this theorem given by M. Schneider, that is Theorem 2.4 in [\cite=sch], corresponds to p = n, m = 0, l = 1. The extension of it due to J-P. Demailly, Theorem 0.2 in [\cite=de1], corresponds to p = n and m = 0, as will be made clear by Theorem A'.

The vanishing theorem of Le Potier, Proposition 2.3 in [\cite=lp1], corresponds to p = n, l = 0 and m = 1. It was generalized by L. Ein and R. Lazarsfeld : Proposition 1.7 of [\cite=el], at least when the vector bundles involved are identical, corresponds to p = n, l = 0 and m arbitrary.

For several ample bundles, say [formula], Theorem A can easily be extended in the following way : the Dolbeault cohomology groups of a product of associated bundles, each of the form appearing in Theorem A, holds under the condition that p + q be greater than n plus the sum of the contributions of each term of the product. This does not follow from the trick used in [\cite=el] to deduce Propposition 1.7 from Le Potier's theorem, but it is a straightforward exercise to modify our proof of Theorem A so as to handle the case of several vector bundles.

Theorem A was proven in [\cite=m2] for p close to n. The methods used in that paper were adapted from [\cite=de1] and much more complicated than those we will use here. The main idea was to work on flag manifolds and compute suitable Dolbeault cohomology groups of well-chosen line bundles - unfortunately, there is no general method to do that and the argument was quite involved. Here, we restrict to relative products of projective bundles. On a projective space, the Dolbeault cohomology of a multiple of the hyperplane bundle is given by a special case of Bott's theorem. Actually, this fortunate fact is a consequence of the irreducibility, as a homogeneous bundle, of the vector bundle of regular differential forms of a given degree on a projective space. On a grassmannian, these bundles of forms are no longer irreducible, but remain completely reducible - on a more general flag manifold this property definitely disappears.

Let us mention that our proof of Theorem A works mutatis mutandis in the case where E or L, instead of being supposed ample, is only k-ample in the sense of Sommese : one then simply has to add k to the numerical vanishing condition of the theorem to get a correct statement. Theorem A therefore also extends Proposition 1.14 of [\cite=so].

Let us now state our main result in a slightly different form. Recall that if V is some finite dimensional complex vector space, the dimension of which we denote by v, the irreducible polynomial representations of the reductive algebraic group Gl(V) are in correspondance with partitions of length at most v, that is, non-increasing sequences of non-negative integers [formula]. The λi are the parts of λ, while its length l(λ) is the number of positive parts. We denote the irreducible Gl(V)-module corresponding to the partition λ by SλV, and call it the Schur power of V of exponent λ. As special cases, one of course recovers symmetric and skew-symmetric powers :

[formula]

where this last expression contains exactly q ones. In particular, [formula], and one has for each integer m the factorization formula

[formula]

One usually represents a partition λ by its Ferrers diagram D(λ), which is a collection of left-justified rows of decreasing lengths from top to bottom, these lengths being given by the parts of λ. If we flip this diagram over its main diagonal, we get the Ferrers diagram of the conjugate partition λ*. The parts of this partition are simply the lengths of the columns of the Ferrers diagram of λ. We then associate to each integer l, with 0  ≤  l  ≤  v - 1, the integer

[formula]

Since a complex vector bundle E of rank e on X has [formula] for structure group, to each partition λ of length at most e coresponds an associated vector bundle SλE. Theorem A can then be restated in the following way :

Theorem A'. Let E be a vector bundle of rank e, and L a line bundle, on a smooth projective complex variety X of dimension n. Suppose that E is ample and L nef, or that E is nef and L ample. Then, for each partition λ of length at most e, and each integer l between 0 and e - 1,

[formula]

Of course, ql(e,λ) is an decreasing function of l. For each Schur power of E, Theorem A' therefore determines a sufficient power of the determinant line bundle of E, to ensure the vanishing of the corresponding Dolbeault cohomology in a given degree.

The equivalence between Theorem A and Theorem A' is an easy consequence of Pieri's rules for the tensor product of a given Schur power by some symmetric or skew-symmetric power. On the one hand, if λ is a partition and l an integer, we let ja  =  λ*a, 1  ≤  a  ≤  m, if λ*a > l, and kb  =  λb - m if b  ≤  l. Then SλE is a component of [formula], and Theorem A thus implies Theorem A'. On the other hand, suppose that SμE is a component of [formula]. Its first part is then at most equal to m. Therefore, if SλE is a component of [formula], one has λj  ≤  l if j > m, so that

[formula]

Theorem A' thus implies Theorem A.

Two consequences of Theorem A-A' should be of particular interest. First note that ql(e,λ) = 0 for l  ≥  l(λ). This implies the following partial answer to the problem raised in [\cite=de1] by J-P. Demailly :

Corollary B. Under the same hypotheses, for each partition λ of length at most e,

[formula]

In particular, for symmetric powers,

[formula]

while for tensor powers,

[formula]

Because of the factorization formula, one may always suppose that l(λ) < e in the fist part of this statement. Corollary B therefore improves and makes more precise Theorem 0.3 of [\cite=de1]. Moreover, its second part extends Griffiths' vanishing theorem to the whole range of the Dolbeault cohomology. Its last part follows from the existence of a decomposition

[formula]

where the size |λ| of the partition λ is defined as the sum of its parts (the multiplicity mλ can be shown to be the degree of the representation of the symmetric group, usually called a Specht module, defined by λ).

It was suggested in [\cite=de2] that the exponent l(λ) + n - p of det E in Corollary B could possibly be replaced by l(λ) +  min (n - p,n - q), and that this exponent could be the optimal one. This was suggested by the observation that if the Borel-Le Potier spectral sequence degenerates at the E2 level, then the exponent e - 1 +  min (n - p,n - q) of det E is sufficient to get a vanishing theorem in degree p + q > n. Unfortunately, it was shown in [\cite=m1] that this degeneracy does not occur in general. Worse, the Borel-Le Potier spectral sequence can be non-degenerate at an arbitrary high level. We see no way to recover the lost symmetry between p and q.

Corollary C. Under the same hypotheses, for each partition λ of length at most e,

[formula]

where [formula]. In particular,

[formula]

Sommese conjectured in [\cite=so] that, under the preceding positivity hypotheses,

[formula]

the case where p = n being Le Potier's theorem. This conjecture was independantly disproved in 1988 by J-P. Demailly [\cite=de1] and M. Schneider, who gave counterexamples already for p = n - 1. Nevertheless, Corollary C shows that Sommese's conjecture becomes correct after a twist by det E to the power n - p.

Apart from a few very special cases, we have no idea about the optimality of our vanishing theorems. Actually, it is a difficult problem to obtain interesting examples of non-vanishing cohomology groups. To our knowledge, the only case that has been investigated in detail is that of grassmannians [\cite=so] [\cite=m2], on which Bott's theorem allow to compute the Dolbeault cohomology of homogeneous bundles in terms of diagrams and the so-called hook lengths, which play an important role in the representation theory of symmetric groups.

In a final section, we propose an application of Theorem A-A' to the geometry of degeneracy loci. Let [formula] be a morphism between vector bundles over an n-dimensional smooth projective variety X, where E and F have ranks e and f, and L is a line bundle. Denote by Dk(φ) its k-th degeneracy locus. Under a strong positivity assumption, we then show that if Dk(φ) has the expected dimension ρ = n - (e - k)(f - k), the restriction morphism

[formula]

is an isomorphism for q < ρ, and is injective for q = ρ. A similar result holds when F = E and φ is symmetric or skew-symmetric. In particular, Dk(φ) is connected, if X is, as soon as ρ is positive.

Proof of Theorem A

On the Borel-Le Potier spectral sequence

Let again E be a complex vector bundle of rank e, F another vector bundle, on a smooth compact complex variety X of dimension n. Let [formula] be the variety of hyperplanes of E, let π be its projection onto X. We denote as usual by OE(1) the universal quotient line bundle on Y, and by OE(k) its k-th power, [formula].

To compute the Dolbeault cohomology of [formula] on Y, we use the fact that the bundle ΩpY of regular p-forms on Y may be filtered according to their degree t on X, that is, by the subbundles

[formula]

The corresponding quotient are the vector bundles

[formula]

where ΩmY / X denotes the vector bundle of relative differential forms of degree m - so that its restriction to each fiber of π is the bundle of m-forms on that fiber.

This implies, for each integer p, the existence of a spectral sequence, which we call after [\cite=de1] the Borel-Le Potier spectral sequence [\cite=lps1]. Its E1-term is given by

[formula]

The Borel-Le Potier spectral sequence converges to the Dolbeault cohomology groups [formula], that is, there is a naturally defined filtration of that complex vector space, with associated graded quotient

[formula]

Let us compute the E1-terms of the Borel-Le Potier spectral sequence. We will denote by (k|l), k  ≥  0, l > 0, the partition of length l, whose first part is equal to k + 1, while its other non zero parts are equal to one : its Ferrers diagram is a hook. The corresponding bundle S(k|l)E associated to E is the kernel of the natural contraction map

[formula]

In particular, S(k|1)E = Sk - 1E, [formula], [formula]. We keep the same notation when k < 0 or l > e, in which case S(k|l)E = 0 (except for k =  - 1 and l = 0).

Lemma D. Suppose that k > 0. Then

[formula]

Proof. We use a Leray spectral sequence to compute the cohomology group

[formula]

Let T denote the tautological hyperplane bundle, of rank e - 1 on Y. The bundle of relative one-forms is [formula], so that its wedge powers [formula]. Such a bundle is homogenous and irreducible, and its cohomology is therefore given by Bott's theorem ([\cite=dem], see also [\cite=lp2]) :

[formula]

The Leray spectral sequence then degenerates at E2, and the lemma follows.  [formula]

More generally, let Yh be the relative product over X, of h copies of Y, and denote the corresponding product of powers of exponents [formula] of the universal quotient line bundle by [formula]. The Dolbeault cohomology of this line bundle, twisted by the pull-back of F, is again computed by a Borel-Le Potier spectral sequence, whose E1 term is given by the following straightforward generalization of lemma D :

Lemma D'. Suppose that [formula]. Then

[formula]

Such a cohomology group can be non zero only if pi  <   min (e,ki) for all i  ≤  h, hence

[formula]

The induction

We now proceed by induction on r = n - p. For simplicity, we divide it in two steps. Here, E is a vector bundle of rank e, and L a line bundle on X. Moreover, we make the positivity hypothesis that E is nef and L ample, or that E is ample and L nef.

First step. Let us prove that for any r  ≥  0, Theorem A for n - p < r implies Theorem A for n - p = r and l = 0 - that is, Corollary C for n - p = r. A collection of integers [formula] being given, with jk  ≤  e for all k, let us consider the Borel-Le Potier spectral sequence that computes the Dolbeault cohomology of [formula] on Ym. If [formula], our previous lemma implies that

[formula]

which is the cohomology group we want to show to be zero. Moreover, for each positive integer u, [formula], while [formula] is given by the direct sum

[formula]

To show that such a group vanishes, we observe that for each k, S(uk|jk - uk)E is a direct factor of [formula], so that it suffices to prove that

[formula]

vanishes. But at most u of the above symmetric powers can have positive exponents, so that we have enough copies of det E to apply our induction hypothesis in degree n - r + u. We obtain

[formula]

We then consider, for u > 0, the following morphisms of our spectral sequence :

[formula]

The left hand side is zero because [formula] is zero, and the right hand side vanishes, as we have just seen, as soon as [formula]. Hence an isomorphism

[formula]

But this last term is a graded piece of some filtration of

[formula]

Since our positivity assumption on E and L, and the fact that [formula] are all positive, implies that the line bundle [formula] is ample, this Dolbeault cohomology group vanishes, by the Kodaira-Akizuki-Nakano vanishing theorem, as soon as p0 + s >  dim Ym, that is, [formula]. This is precisely what we wanted to prove.

Second step. We now show that Theorem A follows for n - p = r and l arbitrary. We fix two collections of integers [formula] and [formula], and consider the Borel-Le Potier spectral sequence that computes the Dolbeault cohomology of

[formula]

on Yl. If p1 = n - r + l(e - 1) =  dim Yl - r, we have, again by the previous lemma,

[formula]

and this is the group we want to show to be zero. Moreover, for each positive integer v, we have [formula], while [formula] is the direct sum

[formula]

But now, for each i, S(ki + vi|e - vi)E is a direct factor of [formula], and at least l - v of these wedge powers are copies of det E. We therefore have enough copies of the determinant line bundle to use our induction hypothesis in degree n - r + v, and we obtain

[formula]

Then we consider, for v > 0, the following morphisms of our spectral sequence :

[formula]

The left hand side is zero, because [formula] is zero, and the right hand side vanishes, as we have just seen, for [formula]. Hence an isomorphism

[formula]

But this last term is a graded piece of some filtration of

[formula]

Since π*E is nef and [formula] is ample on Yl, our first step implies the vanishing of the previous cohomology group for [formula]. Theorem A is proved.

An application to degeneracy loci

It was suggested in [\cite=lay] that vanishing theorems could provide interesting information on the geometry of degeneracy loci. We shall illustrate this idea in that section. It mainly consists in making use of a resolution of the ideal sheaf of a given degeneracy locus. Then we apply vanishing theorems to the different vector bundles involved in this resolution, so as to get some control of the cohomology of that ideal. This allows for example to prove the connectedness of such a degeneracy loci, although under a rather strong positivity hypotheses, and to go a little further.

The simplest case is that of a morphism [formula] between vector bundles of ranks e and f, on a smooth projective variety X of dimension n. The k-th degeneracy locus

[formula]

has a natural scheme structure, given in a trivialisation by the vanishing of minors of order k + 1. We make the assumption that Dk(φ) has the expected codimension, namely (e - k)(f - k). Its ideal sheaf I then has Lascoux's complex [formula] for minimal free resolution [\cite=las], where

[formula]

The notation λ(k) in that expression means the following : if l is the rank of λ, that is the side of the largest square contained in its diagram, then the partition λ(k) is obtained by adjoining k parts equal to l to λ. To get a nonzero Schur power, we therefore need that λ1 + k  ≤  f and λ*1 + k  ≤  e. We will write λ = (l,μ,ν) if μ and ν are the partitions defined by μi  =  λi - l, 1  ≤  i  ≤  l, and νj  =  λj + l.

Theorem E. Let [formula] be a morphism between vector bundles on a smooth projective variety X of dimension n, where E has rank e, F has rank f, and L is a line bundle. Let k <  min (e,f) be a positive integer. We make the following assumptions :

E is ample and F is nef, or E is nef and F ample,

[formula],

Dk(φ) has the expected dimension ρ = n - (e - k)(f - k).

Then the natural restriction map [formula] is an isomorphism for 0  ≤  q < ρ, and is still injective for q = ρ.

If A and B are line bundles, we mean by A  ≥  B that [formula] is nef.

Remark. If X is connected, Dk(φ) is connected as soon as ρ > 0 : this was proved in [\cite=fl] for L = OX and E  →  F ample, without any of our extra hypotheses. But to our knowledge, the equality h0,q(Dk(φ)) = h0,q(X) for q < ρ is new. Note that there is in general no Barth-Lefschetz type isomorphism theorem for degeneracy loci (think for example to the Segre embedding of [formula]), although the map

[formula]

is always surjective for q  ≤  ρ [\cite=fl].

Proof. Let again I be the ideal sheaf of Dk(φ). Our statement is equivalent to the vanishing of Hq(X,I) for q  ≤  ρ, so that it is enough to verify that

[formula]

Now, by Serre duality, this is equivalent to the vanishing

[formula]

for q  ≤  ρ and each non-empty partition λ. But if λ has rank l, then |λ(k)|  ≥  kl and [formula]. Theorem A', and the remarks following Theorem A, therefore imply that

[formula]

for p > ql(λ(k)) = l(e - k - l) - |ν| + l(f - k - l) - |μ|, with the notations of the previous picture. But for p = n - q - |λ| + 1, this condition is equivalent to

[formula]

and the rightmost term of that inequality is non negative.  [formula]

The preceeding approach is also suited to the case of a morphism [formula] which is supposed to be symmetric or skew-symmetric. The expected dimension of the degeneracy locus Dk(φ) is [formula] in the symmetric case, and [formula] in the skew-symmetric case. When this dimension is correct, the minimal resolution [formula] of the ideal sheaf of Dk(φ) has been computed in [\cite=jpw] : if φ is symmetric,

[formula]

where l has to be even, while if φ is skew-symmetric and k is even,

[formula]

With the very same proof, Theorem E extends in the following way :

Theorem F. Let [formula] be a symmetric or skew-symmetric morphism on a smooth projective variety X of dimension n, where E has rank e and L is a line bundle. Let k < e be a positive integer, with k even if φ is skew-symmetric. We make the following assumptions :

E is ample, or simply nef if L is ample,

[formula],

Dk(φ) has the expected dimension [formula] if φ is symmetric, and [formula] if φ is skew-symmetric.

Then the natural restriction map [formula] is an isomorphism for 0  ≤  q < ρ, and is injective for q = ρ.

Corollary G. Under the same hypotheses, Dk(φ) is connected as soon as ρ > 0.

This connectedness was established in [\cite=tu], without our extra hypotheses, in the skew-symmetric case, and in the symmetric case but only when the rank e is even. Again we obtain extra information when the dimension of Dk(φ) is greater than one.

It would be interesting to know whether the conclusions of Theorems E and F hold true for a morphism [formula] under the only assumption that [formula] is ample for the former, and [formula] with [formula] or [formula] ample for the latter, at least when the degeneracy locus has the expected dimension. We hope that suitable vanishing theorems will lead to this improvement of Fulton, Lazarsfeld and Tu's results.
