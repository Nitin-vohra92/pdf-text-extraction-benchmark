Decoupling or nondecoupling: is that the Rb question?

Introduction

The high precision experiments on electroweak observables have yielded spectacular confirmations of the Standard Model, including in the structure of radiative corrections. In particular, the experiments performed on the Z resonance at LEP have probed the couplings of the Z to leptons and quarks. Here, LEP has found significant deviations from the SM predictions on the observed ratios Rb  =  Γb  /  Γhad and Rc  =  Γc  /  Γhad [\cite=reviews] [\cite=Lan95]. The former presents a 3.7σ deviation from the SM value (RSMb  =  0.2156 for a mass of the top mt = 174 GeV), if Rc is used as a free parameter to fit the data. Conversely, one finds Rb  =  0.2205  ±  0.0017, that is 3σ away from the SM prediction, if Rc is fixed at its SM value. This discrepancy might be the first window into Physics beyond the SM. Since Rb exhibits at present a bigger deviation, we shall concentrate on it. There are several features that make this decay special: 1) since the bottom is the isospin parter of a 'heavy' quark, and scalar-fermion couplings are typically proportional to fermion masses, new scalars might give here relevant contributions; 2) the hierarchical structure of the CKM matrix indicates that any heavier family might couple mostly to the b and t quark; 3) the Z  →  b decay is well known for the nondecoupling loop contributions that it gets from the top quark [\cite=topsquared]. It turns out that, if one ignored these contributions (in a blatantly unphysical fashion), the result would be Rb(mt  =  0)  =  0.220 [\cite=Wel95], in accordance with experiment!

Recently, there have been many models proposed to solve these discrepancies, highlighting the first two points. Some solutions have been sought within well motivated theories like Extended Technicolour [\cite=ETC], although the solutions are quite contrived, and Supersymmmetry [\cite=SUSY] [\cite=Sim96]. In the later, the modifications arise through radiative corrections , but the relevant parameter space almost disappears in light of the recent "LEP 1.5" run [\cite=Sim96] [\cite=Ell95].

There has also been a large number of phenomenological proposals. In general, we can write the tree level coupling of Z with a fermion f as

[formula]

with

[formula]

in the absence of isospin mixing. This has prompted phenomenological solutions of both problems where one allows for tree level mixings of the b and/or c quarks with new quarks of the same charge and different weak isospin [\cite=Bha95] [\cite=Ma95] [\cite=Cha96]. Another possibility arises with the introduction of a new "hadrophilic" [formula] that mixes with the Z [\cite=Hol94] [\cite=Chi96] [\cite=Alt96]. For a given choice of parameters, this also allows for an explanation of the excess of dijet events observed at CDF. We note that, in some of the models above one should also worry about the implications on the oblique radiative corrections.

In this article we stress that the third feature mentioned above might be the key to the puzzle. Namely, that the disagreement found in Rb might be signaling us the existence of New Physics through its nondecoupling effects. The top quark, recently discovered by CDF [\cite=topCDF] and D0 [\cite=topD0], exhibits nondecoupling effect in both ρ and Rb. When the experimental data of the later is confronted with the SM values, one finds that the radiative corrections (RC) push the SM in the wrong direction, worsening the problem proportionally to m2t [\cite=topsquared].

Here, we will investigate whether this discrepancy might be explained using the same nondecoupling mechanism that is at work in the SM but with the opposite sign. We do so in the context of models with a fourth family of right or left handed, singlet or doublet quarks. The mirror quark model stands out as a leading candidate, since a mirror [formula] with fixed mixing angle would indeed produce a nondecoupling effect with the correct sign. However, if one requires that there be no tree level b - [formula] mixing, a conspiracy of the mixing angles cancels this effect. In the next section we will briefly discuss nondecoupling effects. We then turn to the addition of mirror quarks to the SM and investigate its consequences. We finish by presenting our conclusions.

Decoupling and nondecoupling

As is well known, the decoupling theorem states that the physical effects of a heavy particle are suppressed at low energies by the inverse powers of the heavy mass scale, if all the other parameters are held fixed [\cite=App75]. An exception to this theorem occurs naturally in gauge theories with spontaneous symmetry breaking. Here, the fermions and scalars often get mass through their Yukawa couplings with Higgs fields. When these Higgs fields get (fixed) vacuum expectation values, we can only increase the mass of those particles increasing the respective Yukawa coupling. These large Yukawa couplings may entail a violation of the decoupling theorem whenever they compensate the heavy mass suppression arising from the propagator [\cite=nondecoupling]. In the SM the leading RC to the Zb vertex come, in the Feynman Gauge, from diagrams involving top quarks and charged would-be-Goldstone bosons. These couple very strongly to the fermionic line, for they are proportional to the Yukawa coupling of the top yt. However, this fact is not sufficient to get a nondecoupling contribution.

In a very elegant article, Liu and Ng [\cite=Liu95] have stressed that nondecoupling corrections to the Zb vertex only occur if the fermion present in the loop transforms chirally under SU(2)  ×  U(1), and if its mass is large compared to that of the exchanged boson. It has become standard to parameterize both the top and New Physics' impact on the bottom vertex by [\cite=Liu95] [\cite=Erl95]

[formula]

These changes are small if one has small tree-level mixing angles or loop correction. A recent fit to the electroweak observables yields [\cite=Erl95]

[formula]

with a large correlation between these parameters. To first order, the change in Rb will then be proportional to gbLδgbL  +  gbRδgbR. Thereby, a positive δgbL change will reduce Rb, worsening the problem one already has without such contributions. A similar situation occurs for a negative δgbR change.

We follow Liu and Ng, and take an interaction of the form yFLφ-FR + h.c. , where φ is the would-be-Goldstone boson , FR an ordinary or new right handed quark whose left handed partner, FL, may transform differently under SU(2). Obviously, neglecting mb, one only changes the left handed coupling. In the mF  ≫  MZ limit, we find

[formula]

where [formula] (which lies between 0 and - 1), confirming the results of ref. [\cite=Liu95]. In the case of the top quark (T3(tR) = 0 and T3(tL) = 1 / 2) one finds the well known m2t dependence [\cite=topsquared],

[formula]

The fact that this change is positive shows that the nondecoupling one loop contribution due to the top reduces Rb, worsening the problem considerably, and leading to the final 3.7σ deviation from experiment.

In the case of a new vector-like top' (singlet or doublet), T3(FR) = T3(FL) and the induced RC are subleading with respect to the SM one,

[formula]

However, a very interesting situation occurs in the presence of mirror fermions. In that case, the isospin quantum numbers of the [formula] are [formula] and [formula], generating a contribution of the form

[formula]

which is nondecoupling like the top, but appears naturally with the opposite sign. Notice that, as in the case of the SM, the γb vertex is protected from non decoupling contributions by the Ward identities, as can be checked explicitly performing the substitutions g / 2cw(T3 - 2s2wQ)  →  eQ and T3  →  0. These (far too) simple considerations would lead one to believe that the addition to the SM of a fourth family of mirror fermions, in which [formula] mixes with t, might entail a simple and natural phenomenological solution of the Rb puzzle. We shall prove in the next section that this is not so and explain how that arises as a consequence of the requirement that there be no tree level b - [formula] mixing.

The decoupling of mirror fermions

In this section we present the main features of a model with an extra fourth mirror family. We will concentrate only on the quark sector. The extra leptons (present only in order to cancel the anomaly) are assumed to decouple completely from the SM ones. We will follow the notation of Lavoura and Silva [\cite=Lav93a] [\cite=Lav93b] and parameterize the mixing of singlet and doublet quarks with mixing matrices VL and VR in terms of which the charged boson interactions become

[formula]

where, i (j) runs over the number of charge 2/3 (-1/3) quarks, and γR,L  =  (1  ±  γ5) / 2. Notice that the matrix VR will exist whenever the right handed quarks belong to nontrivial multiplets, since the gauge bosons couple with fermions through the weak isospin. In general, these matrices are not unitary but are part of larger unitary matrices [\cite=Lav93a]. The neutral current interaction in the presence of mixing becomes,

[formula]

where the hermitian mixing matrices D and U represent projection operators and are given by (α = L,R)

[formula]

It is easy to see that the effective weak isospin of djL is then given by the jj component of -  DL / 2, and similarly for the others. Thus, in Z  →  b, one is probing

[formula]

Comparing Eqs. ([\ref=eq:limits]) and ([\ref=eq:extra]) we see that the tree level mixing of the b with a [formula], which can be either singlet or (lower component of) doublet in either the left or right hand, will always deepen the problem. Therefore, one must impose DLbb = 1 and DRbb = 0. Of course, by looking at Eq. ([\ref=eq:nomixing]) one can easily understand this result and see what isospin assignments must exist in order to circumvent it [\cite=Cha96].

In what follows we will take a fourth family of mirror quarks, assuming that the hierarchical structure of the CKM matrix is preserved, so that the mixing of the new [formula] will occur predominantly with t. Due to the absence of b mixing, the matrices have a very simple form [\cite=Lav93b]

[formula]

Here, the angles θ1 and θ3 are those mixing the left and right handed Q = 2 / 3 quarks when one goes from the weak basis into the mass basis, through

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

where the vectorlike doublet mass term Mq, that is built with the left handed third family doublet and the right handed fourth family doublet, must be zero since we require that b and [formula] do not mix. This constraint equation will be crucial in deriving the decoupling properties. Also, since Δ is the mass term of the upper component of the doublet containing bL, the would-be-Goldstone boson couples bL to the physical quarks, proportionally to it.

In the mb≃0 limit, the Lagrangian describing the interaction with the charged would-be-Goldstone bosons becomes

[formula]

where

[formula]

If there is no [formula] mixing, s1  =  0  =  c3, VL = 1, and UR = 0 recovering the SM result. Notice the proportionality to Δ, as we had anticipated.

The total leading contribution to δgbL, including also the top, is

[formula]

where the repeated indices i,j are summed from t to [formula], and the functions which appear are defined in ref. [\cite=Den91]. In deriving this result we have used the trivial fact that URX  =  0. This generalizes the results in refs. [\cite=Liu95] [\cite=Den91], for this case in which there is isospin mixing. For [formula] the ρ3,4 contributions are subleading and the nondecoupling C0 term yields

[formula]

As expected, the final expression is proportional to Δ2. Fixing mt = 175 GeV would leave three parameters, were it not for the constraint [formula], imposed by Eq. ([\ref=eq:vectormass]). Thus δgbL is a function of only two parameters, for example, the mixing angles s1 and c3. The SM result, cf. Eq. ([\ref=eq:mt2]), is correctly reproduced in the limit s1 = 0 = c3.

Let us look at the impact of Eq. ([\ref=eq:vectormass]) more closely. It clearly implies that θ1 and θ3 must lie in adjacent quadrants. Using only this fact, one can show that the coefficient within the squared brackets is always larger than - 1. In addition, it can only exceed 0 marginally, achieving around +  0.125 when c1 is close to one and c3 is close to 0.85. This is easily understood. In fact, taking [formula] to infinity kills the logarithm, leaving the first term. This will be positive when c21  >  c23  >  s23. For fixed mixing angles, the overall result would then exhibit nondecoupling with the correct (negative) sign, solving the Rb puzzle. Unfortunately, Eq. ([\ref=eq:vectormass]) does more than fix the relative signs. It also implies a relation between the parameters, which we may choose to write as

[formula]

For fixed c1, this ends up changing the sign of the decoupling, as we increase [formula]. The limit of c1  ≥  c3  →  1 must be taken carefully and we obtain the SM result!

Another interesting limit arises for [formula]. In this case Eq. ([\ref=eq:vectormass]) implies s3 =  - c1 and c3 = s1, and we recover again the SM result. In fact, any such mixing is allowed, as we can see by looking back at Eq. ([\ref=eq:changebasis]). For this case, the mass matrix was already diagonal and proportional to unity in the weak basis.

Expressing everything in terms of [formula] and c1, one can show that Eq. ([\ref=eq:deltagbL]) may, at best, reproduce the SM . This occurs whenever c1 = 1, and also for any case with [formula]. With hindsight, this is a simple consequence of the fact that the b vertex picks up those particles that couple primarily to it, while [formula], whose decoupling one would wish to use, couples primarily to [formula]. It is tempting to conjecture that such a situation will occur in any model where this trick is attempted. Prudence advises that one should wait before any strong claim is made [\cite=Bar96].

Three possibilities to evade this conclusion come immediately to mind. One may take the [formula] as the quark produced at the Tevatron and have a lighter t [\cite=Muk91] [\cite=Hou95]. This reduces the m2t prefactor ameliorating the problem. Other possibilities arise taking [formula]. Either t is produced at the Tevatron and [formula] is lighter than 175 GeV, or the [formula] is the one produced at the Tevatron and t is heavier than 175 GeV. These options already have strong experimental constraints from direct searches, and we shall not discuss them further except to point out other nondecoupling properties that must be faced.

In fact, one must also worry about the nondecoupling effects present in the oblique radiative corrections [\cite=oblique] [\cite=Pes90]. We adopt the S and T parameterization of Peskin and Takeuchi, for which the last reported constraints are within 1σ of the SM, but tending towards negative values [\cite=Lan95]. Any violation of the custodial symmetry through mass splittings among particles inside a multiplet will have an impact on T. In turn, the S parameter is sensitive to the chiral breaking. Their expressions for extensions of the SM with the addition of an arbitrary number of vectorlike or mirror fermions are given in ref. [\cite=Lav93b]. For the simple case in which [formula], one finds

[formula]

where the first term is the SM contribution and the second has the same functional dependence but with mb substituted by [formula]. This illustrates in a simple way that [formula] cannot be much larger than [formula] for T grows with the difference of the squared masses. On the other hand, a fourth family of degenerate fermions yields an additional 2 / (3π) contribution to S and is allowed at the 95% level [\cite=Lan95]. In strict model building, one might introduce particles in higher multiplets [\cite=Dug91] to reduce S, but that lies outside the scope of this article.

Conclusions

Prompted by the Rb puzzle, we have analyzed the decoupling properties of an extra [formula] quark that runs in the dominant Z  →  b vertex correction. This is done in the context of a model with extra left or right handed, singlet or doublet quarks. It is well known that a sequential family produces effects that go in the wrong direction. Vectorlike effects are subdominant.

We point out that a mirror [formula] with fixed mixing angle would exhibit nondecoupling with the correct sign, apparently solving the problem. However, when one imposes the absence of tree level b - [formula] mixing (that would take Rb in the wrong direction), the mixing angles conspire to destroy those nondecoupling effects.

It remains to be seen whether complete models may be built with such nondecoupling New Physics effects. That would be a very elegant solution to the Rb puzzle. It would be similar to the situation that occurred when one knew that the top quark had to exist due to its nondecoupling effects in ρ, prior to its discovery by CDF [\cite=topCDF] and D0 [\cite=topD0]. Our study of the decoupling properties of the mirror [formula] shows the importance of the mixing angles in extracting such conclusions, and selecting viable models.

Final Note: After this work was completed we received a comprehensive independent analysis by Bamert, Burgess, Cline, London, and Nardi [\cite=Bam96]. Their analysis includes this model as a particular case and we agree with their results. Here we have chosen to concentrate on the nondecoupling properties from the start and, hence, include the crucial constraint Eq. ([\ref=eq:vectormass]) at the end. Since this constraint is common to a large class of models, they have used it directly in the initial Lagrangian. This corresponds to noting that the ib components of [formula] are proportional to Mq, so that, if one uses Eq. ([\ref=eq:vectormass]) directly on the Lagrangian of Eq. ([\ref=eq:X]) one reproduces their Eq. (48) [\cite=equality].
