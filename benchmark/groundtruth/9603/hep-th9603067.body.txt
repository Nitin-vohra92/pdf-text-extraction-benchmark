Some remarks on 't Hooft's S-matrix for black holes N.Itzhaki Raymond and Beverly Sackler Faculty of Exact Sciences School of Physics and Astronomy Tel Aviv University, Ramat Aviv, 69978, Israel

1. Introduction

A central question in the understanding of black holes is how the gravitational interaction influence the final state of Hawking radiation. Usually, when R  ≪  1 (R is the Riemann curvature) the gravitational effect is small. Hawking concluded therefore that strong gravitational effects take place only near the singularity (where R  ≈  1), far behind the horizon, so the radiation is not affected by it [\cite=haw]. [formula], thus as long as M  ≫  1 the gravitational interaction is only via adiabatic change of the mass of the black hole.

't Hooft, however, pointed out that even for M  ≫  1 strong gravitational interactions occur near the horizon due to the strong red-shift effect and that these interactions are important for the final state of the radiation. Moreover, he was able to suggest an S-matrix for the black hole formation and evaporation process [\cite=th2] based on the classical gravitational shock wave! [\cite=th1] In this note we present objections to the construction of the S-matrix. It is important to emphasize that these objections are not to 't Hooft's S-matrix ansatz or to the claim that the gravitational interactions near the horizon play an important role in the black hole puzzle but only to the specific derivation of the S-matrix. First let us briefly summarize 't Hooft's construction of the S-matrix (the full details are in refs.[\cite=th2] [\cite=th1] [\cite=th4] [\cite=th3]).

2. The S-matrix

The gravitational field of a massless particle in Minkowski space is described by the line element

[formula]

where 2 = x2 + y2. The massless particle moves in the v direction with constant u0 and momentum p [\cite=sex].

There are two effects of such a shock wave on null geodesics :

1-A discontinuity δv at u = u0. The condition on δv is

[formula]

The solution of this equation is

[formula]

where C is an arbitrary constant. For Schwarzchild black hole one get

[formula]

where k is a numerical constant which depends on the black hole mass. The additional term δv is due to the curvature so in the limit of small θ the solution of eq.(4) reduces to the solution of eq.(2) with a well-defined value of C.

2-A refraction in the direction of the null geodesic. The refraction is defined by

[formula]

where [formula] for u < u0 and [formula] for u > u0 (we have assumed x = 0 without loss of generality).

Clearly, when p is small δv is small also, when we describe the interaction in Kruskal coordinates. Let us see what the interaction looks like in Schwarzchild coordinates. Kruskal coordinate and Schwarzchild coordinate are related by [formula] and ρ2 = uv. Where ρ is the invariant distance from the horizon where the outgoing particle crosses the shock wave of the ingoing particle. Suppose that the Schwarzchild energy of the ingoing particle is E then

[formula]

so up to a log (M) factor we get from eq.(3),

[formula]

The interaction, Eq.(7), is strong if the state of the outgoing particle is orthogonal to the state that the outgoing particle would have had in the absence of the ingoing particle. Then the information is completely emitted. This means that

[formula]

where the energy of the outgoing particle is ω. From eq.(7) we find that the information is completely emitted if

[formula]

More generally, one can specify the particles that produced the black hole

[formula]

One can also specify the particles the black hole decay to

[formula]

According to the S-matrix ansatz to a good approximation (large transverse distances) the properties of the black hole are completely determined by the S-matrix

[formula]

Suppose now that we add a single light incoming particle with momentum δpin and angular coordinates Ω''. The in-state is now

[formula]

The effect of the shock wave on the outgoing particles is

[formula]

where f is the Green-function determined by eq.(4). Up to an overall phase only one S-matrix agrees with eq.(14)

[formula]

Clearly, this leads to ultra violet divergences because of the ln (2) in eq.(3). There should be , therefore, a transverse cut-off, resulting from the full Hilbert space yet to be found. As a result the horizon entropy should be finite. But for large transverse distances eq.(15) is supposed to be a good approximation to the ultimate theory of black hole formation and evaporation.

3. Difficulties with the S-matrix

We have two independent objections to the suggested S-matrix. These objections do not rest on assumptions on the Planck scale physics but only on conventional physics. Nevertheless, they lead to important modification of the S-matrix even for large transverse distances.

1. There is a hidden assumption in eq.(14). The hidden assumption is that |  out〉' is a state containing outgoing particles only. In other words the possibility that the outgoing particle is dragged back into the horizon by the ingoing particle (δv > v) is not taken into account. If this happens, then the interaction between the in-state and the out-state is certainly not described by eq.(15). In order to avoid this possibility we must impose that δv < v, which from eq.(7) means that (up to a log (M) factor)

[formula]

This limitation can be understood (up to the log (M) factor) in the following way: when a particle with energy E is thrown into a black hole a new horizon is formed at R = 2M + 2E and the invariant distance from R = 2M + 2E to R = 2M in the original background metric is [formula]. Eqs.(9, 16) implies therefore that the interaction region, meaning the region where the discontinuity effect is strong enough so the information is fully emitted with Hawking radiation but it is not too strong so the outgoing particle is not dragged into the horizon, is

[formula]

The fact that the interaction region is bounded from below is disturbing and was already discussed in [\cite=th3] where it was argued that one is required to consider only those outgoing particles that emerge later than the time interval Δt = 4M ln (M), and that all other particles are completely determined by earlier events. Δt is the time it takes for the ingoing particles to reach ρ  =  1 from ρ = M . This means that the interaction region is bounded from below by the Planck scale. If this were the case then one could not argue against it, since eq.(15) is based on semi-classical arguments which are probably incorrect at the Planck scale any way. But we find (eq.(16)) that the interaction region is bounded from below not by ≈  1 but by [formula]. This means that the validity of eq.(15) requires that the semi-classical approximation is incorrect for scales much larger then 1! This is crucial since the usual arguments for information loss rest on the assumption that the semi-classical approximation is correct for scales much larger then 1.

2. Due to the refraction effect there is another case in which |  out〉' does not contain only outgoing particles: The effect of the refraction is to bend the trajectory of the outgoing particle. If this happens close enough to the horizon then the trajectory of a light signal which moved in the radial direction before it crosses the shock wave is such that it almost reaches R = 3M before it falls back to the black hole. As shown in the appendix only for

[formula]

the particle will not fall back into the horizon.

Since M >  it is obvious that at the interaction region most of the particles (recall that for Hawking radiation [formula]) that are outgoing particles in the absence of the ingoing particle will fall back to the horizon in the presence of the ingoing particle. Also, part of the Hawking photons which were supposed to fall back to the horizon in the absence of the ingoing particle (large angular momenta) will be outgoing particles in the presence of the ingoing particle. Another way to illustrate this point is by using eq.(14) directly. From eqs.(14, 6) and [formula] we find that the difference in the phases of two points Ω1,Ω2 due to the shock wave of an ingoing particle at Ω0 is

[formula]

when [formula] for i = 1,2. Consider Hawking photon in the S-wave state. After it crosses the shock wave his state is a superposition of angular momenta. From eq.(19) we find that the uncertainty in the angular momenta is

[formula]

The centrifugal barrier effect is such that only photons with

[formula]

can cross it. From eqs.(20, 21) we see that if the collision occurs at the interaction region ρ2  ≈  EM part of the S-wave photons will be reflected back by the centrifugal barrier. Furthermore, part of the photons which high angular momenta before they cross the shock wave (but not to high, l of the order of Δl) will not be reflected by the centrifugal barrier due to the shock wave.

4. Summary

The suggested S-matrix (eq.(15)) considers the shock wave effects near the horizon without taking into account the centrifugal barrier. Although the centrifugal barrier has nothing to do with Planckian physics we find that it plays an important role for the ultimate S-matrix of black hole, so, eq.(15) is not a good approximation to the ultimate S-matrix of black hole even at large transverse distances. Furthermore, even without taking into account the effect of the centrifugal barrier on the S-matrix we find that the validity of the suggested S-matrix leads to violation of the semi-classical approximation at large scales compared to the Planck scale. We suspect that any mechanism which supposed to emit the information with Hawking radiation must necessarily violate the semi-classical approximation at large scale.

Appendix

Consider the region near the black hole horizon. In that region the geometry just outside the event horizon is described by the Rindler metric:

[formula]

In terms of Schwarzchild coordinates it is given by

[formula]

Where ρ is the invariant distance from the horizon and t is Schwarzchild time. The Minkowski and Schwarzchild coordinates are related by

[formula]

[formula]

Suppose that an outgoing light particle crosses the shock wave of the ingoing particle at the coordinates

[formula]

and that the ingoing particle coordinates is

[formula]

The transverse distance between the in and outgoing particles is [formula]. Before the collision the outgoing particle's direction was radial [formula]. From eq.(5) we find that after the collision with the shock wave the trajectory is such that

[formula]

Let us find the condition for the particle to fall back into the horizon. In that case the photon will reach the point

[formula]

where Z2 - T2  =  ρ20. We consider null geodesic so (xμ1 - xμ2)2 = 0 thus

[formula]

Since, [formula] and Y < M we get from eq.(27)

[formula]

Finally from eq.(6) we get eq.(17).
