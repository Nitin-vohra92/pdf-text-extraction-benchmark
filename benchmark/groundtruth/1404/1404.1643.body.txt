Introduction

A line spread, or just spread of the projective space [formula] is a partition of the points of [formula] into q2 + 1 lines. It is well known that there is a translation plane of order q2 associated with every line spread of [formula], and that the planes associated to two spreads are isomorphic if and only if the two spreads are equivalent under the group [formula] of automorphisms of [formula]. If q is prime then every translation plane of order q2 arises from a spread of [formula] and this property has been used to completely enumerate the translation planes of orders q2 = 25 [\cite=MR1149895] and q2 = 49 [\cite=MR1468940] [\cite=MR1313377] by computing line spreads of [formula] and [formula] respectively. In this note, we describe an enumeration of the line spreads of [formula], and hence a certain class of translation planes of order 64, and we describe various properties of these planes.

In general, a spread of d-spaces is a partition of [formula] into disjoint copies of [formula] and any spread of d-spaces yields a translation plane of order qd. As 64  =  82  =  43  =  26, this means that a translation plane of order 64 may also arise from a partition of [formula] into copies of [formula] or a partition of [formula] into copies of [formula]. Therefore our search is not a complete enumeration of the translation planes of order 64, but merely those with kernel containing [formula], which are likely to be a tiny fraction of the total number.

Let Γ be the line intersection graph of [formula]; this is the graph with the 4745 lines of [formula] as its vertices, where collinear lines are adjacent. Then a partial spread of [formula] is an independent set of Γ and the maximum size independent sets of Γ are precisely the spreads of [formula]. Thus the enumeration of spreads is equivalent to classifying the maximum independent sets in a particular graph, and as such can be tackled with the computational tools and techniques of graph theory.

Of course, we are only interested in computing the spreads up to equivalence under [formula], the automorphism group of [formula], and here care must be taken with the direct translation into a graph problem. This is because the automorphism group of Γ is not equal to [formula], but rather it is twice as large. This happens because Aut(Γ) also contains permutations of the lines determined by dualities of [formula] (automorphisms that exchange points and hyperplanes). Thus two inequivalent spreads of [formula] may in fact be equivalent under Aut(Γ). Thus, an equivalence class of maximum independent sets of Γ can correspond to either 1 or 2 equivalence classes of spreads of [formula].

Therefore we divide the process into the following two stages: The first stage is to use reasonably standard graph-theoretical techniques for computing one representative of each equivalence class of maximum independent sets of Γ under Aut(Γ), and the second stage is to determine the representatives of equivalence classes of spreads under [formula].

The results, detailed in Section [\ref=results], are that Γ has exactly 1706 equivalence classes of independent sets, of which 578 give a single equivalence class of spreads and 1128 give two equivalence classes of spreads, for a grand total of 578  +  2  ×  1128  =  2834 equivalence classes of spreads of [formula].

Computational Details

There are a number of standard techniques that take as input a graph Γ and produce one representative of each equivalence class of independent sets of all sizes under Aut(Γ). In general, these proceed by augmenting smaller independent sets vertex-by-vertex and using either an explicit isomorphism check, or the implicit isomorphism checking used by orderly algorithms, to avoid constructing equivalent independent sets.

In this situation however, we are only interested in the maximum size independents sets, and so a branch of the search should be terminated as soon as it can be detected that the independent set currently under consideration has no completions of the desired size. However, a more serious problem is that an independent set can be constructed in this fashion by adding the vertices in any order, and there can be vast numbers of inequivalent orderings of the vertices, just as there are vast numbers of inequivalent partial spreads.

To overcome these problems, we use the special structure of both the graph and the maximum independent sets that we are seeking. As [formula] has 585 points and there are 73 lines through each point, the edge set of Γ consists of 585 edge-disjoint cliques of size 73, with each clique corresponding to all the lines through a particular point. Each pair of cliques meets in a unique vertex of Γ, namely the line connecting the corresponding pair of points. As Aut(Γ) is transitive, we can freely choose any one line, say [formula], to be excluded from the spread. This determines nine cliques, one for each point of [formula], that each contribute a single vertex (other than [formula]) to the spread. We use the term starter or starter based at [formula] to denote an independent set of size 9 consisting of one vertex from each of these cliques.

The computation of the inequivalent starters was independently performed twice, first by an orderly algorithm of the type described in , and secondly by a GAP program using the command SmallestImageSet that, given a group and a k-set of points, computes the lexicographically least equivalent k-set. This initial computation resulted in a collection of 1460 starters. The correctness of this part of the computation can be verified theoretically. Given a line [formula] containing 9 points p1, p2, [formula], p9, we can exactly count the total number of starters based at [formula]: there are 72 choices for the line through p1, then (72 - 8) choices for the line through p2, then 72 - (2  ×  8) choices for the line through p3, and so on. The number 72  -  (k  ×  8) of choices for the line through pk + 1 arises simply by counting the number of lines (other than [formula]) joining pk + 1 to a point on one of the k previously chosen lines. No line through pk + 1 other than [formula] can meet two of the previously chosen lines, or else all three lines would lie in a plane with [formula] and hence meet, and so these choices are distinct. Thus counting the total number of pairs [formula] where S is a starter based at [formula], we get

[formula]

where S ranges over each of the 1460 inequivalent starters, G  =  Aut(Γ), GS is the stabiliser of S and t(S) is the number of lines transversal to S (that is, meeting every line of S). As the computed values for the 1460 starters satisfy this equation, we are confident that the collection of starters is correct and complete.

The second stage of the computation is to process each starter individually, determining the spreads that arise from that particular starter.

The final stage of the computation is to determine whether the independent set represents one or two equivalence classes of spreads under [formula], which is a subgroup of index 2 inside G  =  Aut(Γ). Let g denote an arbitrary element of [formula], and suppose that S is a maximum independent set in Γ. If

[formula]

then S and Sg are inequivalent under [formula], and so correspond to two non-isomorphic spreads, while if

[formula]

then S and Sg are equivalent under [formula], and yield a single spread.

Results

There are 1706 pairwise inequivalent spreads of Γ under the group Aut(Γ) which yield a total of 2834 pairwise inequivalent spreads under [formula]. The spectrum of automorphism group sizes is listed in Table [\ref=tab:autgroups].

The data, namely the list of spread sets may be downloaded from the wRecall that a spread of [formula] can be viewed as a collection of 2-dimensional subspaces of [formula] that intersect only in the zero vector. Let [formula] and [formula] be two such subspaces. The 2-dimensional subspaces meeting these only in the zero vector all have the form [formula], where A is a non-singular 2  ×  2 matrix and vectors are given as row-vectors. Under the action of [formula], any spread is equivalent to one containing W∞ and W0, which therefore has the form

[formula]

where each Ai is a 2  ×  2 matrix. The set of 64 matrices [formula] is called a spread set and provides a compact description of any spread (up to equivalence). The condition that the subspaces WAi and WAj are disjoint can readily be seen to be equivalent to the condition that Ai  -  Aj is non-singular. If S is a spread with spread set {Ai}, then the set {ATi} obtained by transposing all the matrices is another spread set, and so corresponds to another spread that we denote ST. While S and ST are equivalent under Aut(Γ) they may not be equivalent under [formula].

A complete list of the spread sets is available either on or from the first author's website at . Each spread set occupies one line of 256 characters consisting of the 64 2  ×  2 matrices written row-by-row. Each character is in the range [formula] and corresponds to an element of [formula] where 0 represents 0, and j  >  0 represents xj - 1 where x is a primitive element of [formula] satisfying x3 + x + 1 = 0. One file contains the 1706 spread sets pairwise inequivalent under Aut(Γ) and a second contains the 2834 spread sets pairwise inequivalent under [formula].

Rank

The rank, over [formula], of the incidence matrix of a projective plane of order pm is a useful invariant of the plane (usually studied in conjunction with other properties of the [formula]-linear code generated by the incidence matrix of plane) called the p-rank of the plane. A famous conjecture of Hamada [\cite=MR0332515] asserts that the Desarguesian plane [formula], which has p-rank

[formula]

has the lowest rank among all projective planes of the same order. When p = 2, m = 6 this gives a rank of 730 and as shown in Table [\ref=tab:2rank], this is the lowest rank among this collection of translation planes by a considerable margin. Hamada originally made a broader conjecture -- applicable to a larger class of designs -- that has been shown to be false in general, but restricted to projective planes, the conjecture remains firmly open and seems well supported by the (admittedly limited) evidence available.

It is interesting to note that more than 96% of the planes have 2-rank equal to 1138, but it is not clear whether this has any particular significance.
