On distance two in Cayley graphs of Coxeter groups

Introduction

The distance between two vertices in a connected graph is defined as the smallest number m such that the vertices are connected by a path consisting of m edges. Two vertices are said to be 2-adjacent if the distance between them is equal to 2. A clique in a graph is a subset of the vertex set, where any two distinct vertices are adjacent (connected by an edge). We say that a subset in the vertex set is a 2-clique if any two distinct elements of this subset are 2-adjacent vertices.

The main object of this paper is the Cayley graph C(W,S) of a Coxeter system (W,S).

If S consists of n mutually commuting involutions then the Cayley graph is the n-dimensional hypercube graph. It is well-known that this graph contains precisely two types of maximal 2-cliques (maximal cliques of the corresponding half-cube graph). Every maximal 2-clique of the first type consists of the n vertices adjacent to a given vertex and maximal 2-cliques of the second type are formed by four elements.

We show that the Cayley graph of any Coxeter system contains at most three types of maximal 2-cliques (Theorem [\ref=theorem1]). The first type is Sw, w∈W (our Cayley graph is left). Maximal 2-cliques of the second type correspond to triples of mutually non-adjacent nodes in the associated Coxeter diagram and contain precisely four elements. The third type is related to unlabeled edges of the Coxeter diagram, i.e. pairs s,s'∈S such that the order of ss' is 3. Every maximal 2-clique of this type consists of three elements.

In Section 5, we consider the half of Cayley graph (a generalization of the half-cube graph). Using Theorem [\ref=theorem1], we show that every automorphism of this graph can be uniquely extended to an automorphism of the Cayley graph if |S|  ≥  5.

Coxeter systems and associated Cayley graphs

Let W be a group generated by a finite set S. Suppose that every element of S is an involution. For distinct s,s'∈S we denote by m(s,s') the order of the element ss'. Then m(s,s') = m(s',s) and the condition m(s,s') = 2 is equivalent to the commuting of s and s'.

From this moment we suppose that (W,S) is a Coxeter system. This means that the group W has the following presentation

[formula]

where [formula] is the set of all pairs (s,s') such that m(s,s') is finite. Our Coxeter system is completely defined by the associated Coxeter diagram whose nodes are the elements of S. The nodes corresponding to s and s' are connected by an edge only in the case when m(s,s')  ≥  3 (the involutions s and s' are non-commuting). If m(s,s')  ≥  4 then the edge connecting s and s' is labeled by the number m(s,s'). All spherical and affine Coxeter systems are known, see [\cite=BB] or [\cite=Davis] for the corresponding irreducible diagrams.

The Cayley graph C(W,S) is the graph whose vertex set is W and w,v∈W are adjacent vertices if v = sw for a certain s∈S (since S consists of involutions, the adjacency relation is symmetric). In contrast to [\cite=Davis], our Cayley graph is left. In the right Cayley graph, w,v∈W are adjacent if v = ws for a certain s∈S. The mapping w  →  w- 1 is an isomorphism between these graphs.

The Cayley graph of the dihedral group 2(n) is the (2n)-cycle. See [\cite=BB] for the Cayley graphs of 3 and 3.

For every w∈W the right multiplication

[formula]

is an automorphism of the Cayley graph. If the diagram of our Coxeter system does not contain adjacent edges labeled by ∞   then the automorphism group of the Cayley graph is the semidirect product of W and the automorphism group of the diagram [\cite=BB].

The length l(w) of an element w∈W is the smallest number m such that w has an expression

[formula]

This is the distance between 1 and w in the Cayley graph. The distance d(w,v) between w,v∈W is equal to

[formula]

In what follows we will say that [\eqref=eq-express] is a reduced expression if m = l(w).

If u and u' are adjacent to w then u = sw and u' = s'w for some s,s'∈S. Since d(s,s') = 2, the elements u and u' are not adjacent. Therefore, every maximal clique of the Cayley graph is a pair of adjacent vertices.

We will use the following well-known properties of Coxeter systems, see [\cite=BB] [\cite=Davis].

For every reduced expression [\eqref=eq-express] and every s∈S satisfying l(sw)  ≤  m there exists [formula] such that

[formula]

(the symbol [formula] means that the corresponding term is omitted).

For every w∈W there is a subset Sw  ⊂  S such that every reduced expression of w is formed by all elements of Sw.

The group W cannot be spanned by a proper subset of S.

Maximal 2-cliques

First we present three examples of 2-cliques in the Cayley graph C(W,S).

Our main result is the following.

Every maximal 2-clique of the Cayley graph C(W,S) is one of the 2-cliques described above.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem1]

If [formula] is 2-adjacent to three distinct s,s',s''∈S then s,s',s'' are mutually commuting and u = ss's''.

Since u is 2-adjacent to s,s',s'' and [formula], there are three reduced expressions

[formula]

where s1,s2,s'1,s'2,s''1,s''2∈S. Proposition [\ref=prop-b1] guarantees that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Thus we have the following possibilities for the first and second expressions:

u = s''s's = s''ss',

u = s''s's = ss''s',

u = s's''s = s''ss',

u = s's''s = ss''s'.

Case (1). The involutions s,s' are commuting and the third expression is

[formula]

Then s''s's = u = s'ss'' and s's''s's = ss''. We apply the exchange condition to w = s''s's and get the following three possibilities:

s's = ss'',

s''s = ss'',

s''s' = ss''.

The first and the third contradict to Proposition [\ref=prop-b2]. Thus s and s'' are commuting. Similarly, the equality s''s's = u = ss's'' shows that ss''s's = s's''. Using the above arguments, we establish that s' and s'' are commuting.

Case (2). The equality s''s's = ss''s' implies that s's = s''ss''s'. As in the previous case, we show that s and s' are commuting. Then the third expression is [\eqref=eq1] which implies that ss''s' = u = ss's'' and s',s'' are commuting. The equality

[formula]

guarantees that s and s'' are commuting.

Case (3). We have s's''s = s''ss' and s''s's''s = ss'. As above, this means that s,s' are commuting and the third expression is [\eqref=eq1]. Then s's''s = u = s'ss'' and s,s'' are commuting. The equality

[formula]

shows that s' and s'' are commuting.

Case (4). Since s's''s = ss''s', we have

[formula]

By the above arguments, this guarantees that s'' is commuting with both s and s'. Then

[formula]

which implies that s and s' are commuting.

Lemma [\ref=lemma1] shows that for any three mutually commuting s,s',s''∈S the 2-clique formed by s,s',s'' and ss's'' is maximal. Therefore, every 2-clique of the second type is maximal.

If [formula] is 2-adjacent to s,s'∈S then one of the following possibilities is realized:

m(s,s') = 3 and u = ss's = s'ss',

s,s' are commuting and u = s''s's for a certain s''∈S.

Since u is 2-adjacent to s,s' and [formula], there are two reduced expressions

[formula]

where s1,s2,s'1,s'2∈S. By Proposition [\ref=prop-b1],

[formula]

If |Su| = 2 then Su  =  {s,s'} and

[formula]

which implies that m(s,s') = 3, i.e. the first possibility is realized.

If |Su| = 3 then Su  =  {s,s',s''} and, as in the proof of Lemma [\ref=lemma1], we have the following possibilities for the above expressions:

u = s''s's = s''ss',

u = s''s's = ss''s',

u = s's''s = s''ss',

u = s's''s = ss''s'.

Each of these equalities gives the second possibility. Indeed, the case (1) is trivial and for the cases (2) - (4) this follows from Remark [\ref=rem-proof].

By Lemma [\ref=lemma2], for any s,s'∈S satisfying m(s,s') = 3 the 2-clique formed by s,s' and ss's = s'ss' is maximal. Thus every 2-clique of the third type is maximal.

Now we prove Theorem [\ref=theorem1]. Let C be a maximal 2-clique of the Cayley graph. For any u,u'∈C there exist w∈W and s,s'∈S such that u = sw and u' = s'w. The maximal 2-clique Cw- 1 contains s and s'. Thus we can suppose that C contains at least two distinct elements of S.

So, let s and s' be elements of S belonging to C. Suppose that C  ≠  S, i.e. there is [formula]. We have the following possibilities:

there is a third element s''∈S contained in C,

C contains precisely two elements of S.

In the first case, Lemma [\ref=lemma1] implies that s,s',s'' are mutually commuting and

[formula]

In the second case, Lemma [\ref=lemma2] gives the following possibilities:

[formula]

or s,s' are commuting and u = s''s's for a certain s''∈S. The latter means that the maximal 2-clique Cs's contains s,s',s'', i.e.

[formula]

Then C is a 2-clique of the first type or the second type.

The half of Cayley graph

The group W can be presented as the disjoint union of the following subsets

[formula]

Using the exchange condition we establish the following:

the distance between any two elements of Wi, i∈{1,2} is even,

the distance between every element of W1 and every element of W2 is odd,

Also, note that W2 is a subgroup of W.

Consider the graph Γi, i∈{1,2} whose vertex set is Wi and two elements of Wi are adjacent vertices if the distance between them (in the Cayley graph) is equal to 2. The right multiplication Rw preserves both Wi if w∈W2. If w∈W1 then Rw transfers W1 to W2 and conversely, i.e. Rw induces an isomorphism between Γ1 and Γ2.

Every 2-clique of the Cayley graph is contained in W1 or W2 and every maximal clique of Γi, i∈{1,2} is a maximal 2-clique of C(W,S) contained in Wi.

If |S|  ≥  5 then every isomorphism between Γi and Γj i,j∈{1,2} can be uniquely extended to an automorphism of the Cayley graph.

We consider the case when i = j = 1. Let f:W1  →  W1 be an automorphism of Γ1. Then f preserves the family of maximal cliques of Γ1. Every maximal clique of Γ1 is a maximal 2-clique of C(W,S) contained in W1. By Theorem [\ref=theorem1], there are precisely three types of such subsets. They contain |S| vertices, 4 vertices and 3 vertices, respectively. The condition |S|  ≥  5 guarantees that f preserves the types of maximal cliques.

If w∈W2 then Sw is a maximal clique of Γ1 and f(Sw) = Sw' for a certain w'∈W2. We set f(w): = w' and get a bijective transformation of W.

If w,v∈W are adjacent vertices of the Cayley graph then one of these vertices belongs to W1 and the other is an element of W2. Suppose that v∈W1 and w∈W2. Then v∈Sw and f(v)∈f(Sw) = Sf(w) which implies that f(v) and f(w) are adjacent vertices of the Cayley graph. The apply the same arguments to f- 1 and establish that f is an automorphism of the Cayley graph.

The uniqueness of such extension follows from the fact that w is the unique vertex of the Cayley graph adjacent to all vertices from Sw (Remark [\ref=rem1]).

Suppose that |S|  ≥  5. Let f be a bijective transformation of W preserving the distance 2 in both directions, i.e.

[formula]

for all w,v∈W. Then there are two automorphisms f1 and f2 of the Cayley graph such that the restriction of f to Wi, i∈{1,2} coincides with the restriction of fi to Wi .

It is not difficult to show that f preserves both Wi or transfers W1 to W2 and conversely. Corollary [\ref=cor1] gives the claim.
