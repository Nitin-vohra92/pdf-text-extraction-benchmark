Dark matter relic density in Gauss-Bonnet braneworld cosmology

Introduction

Precision astrophysical and cosmological measurements have now established that a significant fraction of the matter content in the universe is composed of non-baryonic Dark Matter (DM) [\cite=Hooper]. The data favour cold (non-relativistic) dark matter (CDM) and give the present density as (68% C.L.) [\cite=Lahav:2014vza]

[formula]

where ΩDM is the dark matter density as a fraction of the total mass-energy budget and h  =  0.678  ±  0.008 is defined by the present value of the Hubble constant H0  =  100  h km/s/Mpc. The most popular theoretical CDM candidates are WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles) with mass mχ  ~  O(10  -  1000) GeV. One viable WIMP candidate is the neutralino, the lightest supersymmetric particle in supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model (SM) in which R-parity is conserved.

The origin of the DM can be explained by the thermal relic scenario [\cite=KandT]: at early times, frequent interactions keep the DM particles in equilibrium with the background cosmic bath. As the universe expands and cools, the Boltzmann suppressed interaction rate drops below the expansion rate and the DM particles fall out of equilibrium. At this point - known as particle freeze-out - both annihilation and creation processes cease and the number density redshifts with expansion; the surviving 'relic' particles constitute the dark matter density we observe today.

Due to the Boltzmann suppression factor in the equilibrium number density, the present dark matter abundance depends sensitively on the timing of freeze-out: the longer a species remains in thermal contact with the background bath, the lower its density at freeze-out. In the standard cosmological model of cold DM with a non-zero cosmological constant (denoted the ΛCDM model), particle freeze-out occurs during the radiation dominated era when the expansion rate [formula] (where [formula] GeV is the Planck mass). In this scenario, a DM candidate with a weak scale interaction cross section, [formula], freezes out with an abundance that matches the presently observed value [\eqref=eq:dm_abun] - this is known as the 'WIMP miracle' and strongly motivates thermal WIMP dark matter models.

Despite the observational success of ΛCDM, current datasets leave the physics of the universe prior to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) (t  ~  200 s) relatively unconstrained. If the universe experiences a non-standard expansion law at early times, and in particular during the era of DM decoupling, particle freeze-out may be accelerated (or delayed) and the relic abundance enhanced (or suppressed) [\cite=DBarrow1982501] [\cite=PhysRevD.81.123522] [\cite=Pallis:2009ed] [\cite=Salati2003121] [\cite=Arbey200846] [\cite=Gelmini:2013awa] [\cite=Iminniyaz:2013cla] [\cite=Meehan:2014zsa] (see also [\cite=Gelmini:2009yh]).

An interesting class of alternative cosmological models that address this pre-BBN era is provided by the braneworld scenario in which the observable universe is a 3(+1) dimensional surface (the 'brane') embedded in a five dimensional bulk spacetime. Standard Model particles are confined to the surface of the brane whilst gravity propagates in the higher dimensional bulk [\cite=Langlois:2002bb] [\cite=Maartens:2010ar]. This class of models is motivated by (super)string theory and M-theory which require additional spacetime dimensions for internal consistency.

In the widely studied Randall-Sundrum type II (RSII) model [\cite=Randall:1999vf], General Relativity (GR) is recovered on the surface of a 3(+1) Minkowski brane located at the ultraviolet boundary of a five dimensional anti-de Sitter bulk. The warped geometry of the bulk spacetime ensures the fifth dimension is only accessible in the ultraviolet regime and that ΛCDM is reproduced in the low energy limit. Relic DM abundances in a RSII braneworld model have been investigated for both the case of symmetric DM [\cite=PhysRevD.70.083531] [\cite=PhysRevD.71.063535] [\cite=PhysRevD.73.063518] [\cite=PhysRevD.79.115023] [\cite=AbouElDahab:2006wb] [\cite=Meehan:2014zsa], in which the DM particles are Majorana fermions, that is the particles χ and antiparticles [formula] are identical, χ  =  , and the case of asymmetric DM [\cite=Meehan:2014zsa] in which the particles and antiparticles are distinct, χ  ≠  . In both cases the enhanced early time expansion rate boosts the final relic abundance.

In this article we consider an extension of the RSII model which incorporates a Gauss-Bonnet (GB) higher order curvature term in the bulk action integral, thus modifying the braneworld dynamics at high energies. The relic density of DM in the Gauss-Bonnet braneworld scenario has been studied by [\cite=PhysRevD.79.103528] for the case of symmetric DM. The GB braneworld effect is treated approximately through the use of a simple multiplicatively modified Hubble expansion which can be interpreted as a multiplicatively modified annihilation cross section in the Boltzmann rate equation and allows the development of an approximate analytic expression for the asymptotic relic abundance. They found that the expansion rate was reduced in the GB model, delaying particle freeze-out and leading to a suppressed relic abundance. This is in direct contrast to the behaviour observed in the RSII braneworld model. This finding, however, is based upon a highly contrived situation in which the Gauss-Bonnet expansion era evolves directly into a standard General Relativity expansion era, rather than passing through a Randall-Sundrum expansion era as is the general case. This collapse of the RS era requires equating the mass scale mα of the GB modification and the mass scale mσ of the brane tension. However, if the GB contribution is to be considered as the lowest order correction from string theory to the RS action, we would expect mα  >  mσ. It is therefore important to investigate the effect upon the relic abundance of choosing more realistic values for the ratio [formula] of these two mass scales.

In the present paper we revisit the calculation of the relic abundance of DM in the GB scenario and study the effects of breaking the assumption Rm = 1 made by [\cite=PhysRevD.79.103528], replacing it by more realistic values. We also extend the investigation to consider both symmetric and asymmetric DM species and discuss the implications for DM detection experiments and DM particle models.

In the next section we introduce the action integral for the braneworld bulk which includes the Gauss-Bonnet higher curvature term and discuss the modified Friedmann equation in this model. Then, in section [\ref=sec:sdm], we calculate the DM relic abundance in the Gauss-Bonnet braneworld scenario before deriving constraints on the GB model parameters using the observed relic density. This is repeated for the case of asymmetric DM in section [\ref=sec:adm] and, finally, in section [\ref=sec:con] we summarize our results.

Gauss-Bonnet Braneworlds

The Randall-Sundrum braneworld model derived from the five dimensional Einstein-Hilbert action can be considered as a low energy effective model of some higher order field theory such as string theory or M-theory. Since our interest in the model lies in the high energy regime where additional quantum corrections in the bulk action may contribute to the braneworld dynamics, we include the leading order correction from heterotic string theory, known as the Gauss-Bonnet term LGB [\cite=Gross198741], which is given by

[formula]

Inclusion of higher order curvature terms generally leads to fourth order equations of motion. However, in five dimensions, the GB combination of invariants constructed from the Riemann tensor Rabcd is of particular significance since it is the unique combination that leads to second order gravitational field equations in the bulk metric which are symmetric, divergenceless and ghost free [\cite=Clifton:2011jh].

Inclusion of the Gauss-Bonnet term modifies the Randall-Sundrum action so that the action integral for the GB braneworld model, taken over the five dimensional bulk spacetime M, is

[formula]

where g is the determinant of the bulk metric gab, R is the five dimensional Ricci scalar and Λ5( < 0) is the bulk cosmological constant. We have parameterized the GB contribution through the coupling α which, if this contribution is to be considered as the lowest order correction from string theory to the Randall-Sundrum action, must satisfy [\cite=PhysRevD.70.083525] [\cite=Tsujikawa2004a] α|R2|  ≪  |R|. Consequently, [formula] where [formula] is the bulk curvature scale [formula]. Introducing the associated energy scale [formula] then we require

[formula]

The matter fields, which are localized on the brane surface ∂M, are included via

[formula]

where h is the determinant of the induced metric hμν on the brane surface, Lm is the matter field Lagrangian and σ( > 0) is the brane tension. Varying the total action Stot  =  SM  +  Sm (+ boundary terms) with respect to the metric field and solving the resulting field equations yields the modified Friedmann equation for the GB braneworld scenario [\cite=0264-9381-19-18-304] [\cite=PhysRevD.67.024030]

[formula]

where ρ is the energy density of matter fields on the brane and [formula].

The modified Friedmann equation [\eqref=eq:gb_hub] clearly predicts non-standard behaviour for the expansion of the universe. However, in the low energy limit, equation [\eqref=eq:gb_hub] reduces to the standard expansion law for a flat universe

[formula]

provided we identify [\cite=Neupane:2001]

[formula]

Additionally, requiring that the four dimensional cosmological constant Λ4 vanish gives

[formula]

which is equivalent to the familiar Randall-Sundrum tuning in the limit α  →  0.

As shown in [\cite=PhysRevD.67.103510], it is possible to solve equation [\eqref=eq:gb_hub] to get an explicit expression for the Hubble factor H;

[formula]

where χ is related to the energy density ρ via

[formula]

and the two mass scales mα and mσ, which correspond to the GB correction and the brane tension respectively, are given by

[formula]

Substituting in the constraints [\eqref=eq:tune1] and [\eqref=eq:tune2], mα and mσ can be written in terms of the two remaining free parameters μ and β as

[formula]

Since the Gauss-Bonnet term is a high energy correction to the regular Randall-Sundrum action, we expect β  ≪  1. This motivates us to introduce the quantity

[formula]

which measures the ratio of the two mass scales and depends only on β. The two mass scales are equal for β  =  0.1509 but, as we expect β  ≪  1, the general situation will be Rm  >  1.

Before choosing specific values of β, we first discuss the evolution of the modified expansion rate in the generalized Gauss-Bonnet scenario. By expanding [\eqref=eq:gb_hub] in the high, intermediate, and low energy limits, we see that the Hubble factor evolves through three distinct expansion regimes, characterized by the mass scales mα and mσ [\cite=PhysRevD.70.083525] [\cite=PhysRevD.79.103528]:

The GB regime: ρ  ≫  m4α

[formula]

The RS regime: m4α  ≫  ρ  ≫  m4σ

[formula]

The standard regime: m4σ  ≫  ρ

[formula]

At early times, during the Gauss-Bonnet regime, the expansion rate of the universe H  ~  ρ1 / 3 falls more slowly than the standard expansion law H  ~  ρ1 / 2. Later, the universe evolves into a Randall-Sundrum type era with an enhanced expansion H  ~  ρ, before finally reducing to the standard expansion law in the low energy limit (see figure [\ref=fig:GB_hub_betam15_mum44]). The duration of the Randall-Sundrum regime is determined by the magnitude of [formula]: when Rm is small, the RS era is short and the expansion rate passes quickly from the Gauss-Bonnet era to the standard era; when Rm is large, the duration of the Randall-Sundrum era is extended. Using the expression for Rm (equation [\eqref=eq:rmdef]) we see that these two cases correspond to [formula] and β  →  0, respectively.

The investigation by [\cite=PhysRevD.79.103528] chose to collapse the Randall-Sundrum era by equating mα  =  mσ, setting β  =  0.1509. In this case, the early time expansion rate is always slower than (or equal to) the standard expansion rate. The slower expansion rate delays dark matter particle freeze-out and suppresses the relic abundance. This is obviously a contrived scenario considering the Gauss-Bonnet term is a high energy correction to the Randall-Sundrum action and we expect mα  >  mσ, corresponding to β  ≪  1. In the next section we will show that the unnatural choice of β  =  0.1509 and the conclusions drawn in [\cite=PhysRevD.79.103528] misrepresent the typical behaviour of the relic density in the Gauss-Bonnet braneworld model and that, in fact, the dark matter abundance tends to be enhanced rather than suppressed when realistic values of β are used.

It is convenient for the derivation of approximate solutions for the dark matter relic density (see next section) to express the modified expansion rates in the early universe (equations [\eqref=eq:gb_reg] and [\eqref=eq:rs_hub]) in terms of the standard expansion rate HGR. Since the energy density of the universe during the era of dark matter decoupling is dominated by radiation with ρr  =  π2g*(T)T4 / 30, where g*(T) is the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, equations [\eqref=eq:gb_reg] and [\eqref=eq:rs_hub] can be written as

[formula]

where x  =  mχ / T is a dimensionless variable and xGBt and xRSt are given by

[formula]

The quantity xRSt effectively denotes the transition point between the Randall-Sundrum expansion era and the standard expansion era. In order to preserve the successful predictions of BBN, the standard expansion law HGR must be restored prior to T  =  1 MeV. Thus we require [formula], which, using [\eqref=eq:xtrs], gives the conservative bound

[formula]

Furthermore, if we assume that particle freeze-out occurs at [formula], we can derive an upper limit on the relevant range of μ. Again, using equation [\eqref=eq:xtrs], we find [formula] GeV and [formula] GeV for mχ  =  100 GeV and mχ  =  10 GeV respectively. For larger values of μ the standard expansion rate is restored prior to particle freeze-out and particle decoupling is unaffected.

Symmetric Dark Matter

We begin this section by reviewing the relic abundance calculation for a symmetric dark matter species χ( = ) initially in equilibrium with the background cosmic bath. The dark matter number density nχ evolves according to the relativistic Boltzmann equation

[formula]

where 〈σv〉 is the thermally averaged annihilation cross section and [formula] is the equilibrium number density. Here, we assume that annihilations are dominated by s-wave processes for which the annihilation cross section is a constant, i.e. 〈σv〉  =  σ0.

It is convenient to rewrite the Boltzmann equation [\eqref=eq:boltsym] in terms of x  =  mχ / T and the comoving number density Y = nχ / s, where s is the entropy density given by s  =  2π2g*(T)T4 / 45. We then have

[formula]

where [formula], gχ  =  2 is the number of internal degrees of freedom of the dark matter species χ and

[formula]

is a temperature dependent factor related to the change in the number of degrees of freedom. The present dark matter density, ΩDMh2, is obtained from the asymptotic solution (x  →    ∞  ) of equation [\eqref=eq:bolt]

[formula]

where Y∞ = Y(x  →    ∞  ) is the present comoving density.

In general, the Boltzmann equation cannot be solved analytically and equation [\eqref=eq:bolt] must be integrated numerically. However, an approximate solution can be found by exploiting the exponential decay of [formula]: as outlined in [\cite=PhysRevD.33.1585] [\cite=KandT], the creation term ([formula]) in equation [\eqref=eq:bolt] can be neglected following particle decoupling (i.e. for x  >  xf) and the resulting expression can be integrated directly once the expansion rate and annihilation cross section have been specified. Taking H  =  HGR and 〈σv〉  =   constant, we get the well-known approximate solution for the asymptotic comoving density in the standard cosmological scenario

[formula]

where [formula] and xGRf is the freeze-out point in the standard scenario that can be estimated using [\cite=PhysRevD.33.1585] [\cite=KandT]

[formula]

with a≃0.145  gχ / g* and c  ≈  0.6 a numerical constant (see [\cite=KandT] for more details).

In the Gauss-Bonnet braneworld scenario, the universe first passes through a Gauss-Bonnet and then a Randall-Sundrum type expansion era before relaxing to the standard expansion law (see previous section). We therefore need to find equivalent expressions to [\eqref=eq:yinfst] for when dark matter decoupling occurs during each of these non-standard regimes.

Taking H  =  HGB (equation [\eqref=eq:gb_hub]), we find that if decoupling occurs during a Gauss-Bonnet type expansion regime [\cite=PhysRevD.79.103528],

[formula]

where

[formula]

and the freeze-out point is

[formula]

Similarly, if decoupling occurs during the Randall-Sundrum era [\cite=PhysRevD.70.083531]

[formula]

which we note is independent of the freeze-out point xf (provided xRSt  ≫  xf).

Comparing equations [\eqref=eq:ysym] and [\eqref=eq:yinfrs] with [\eqref=eq:yinfst], we see that the asymptotic comoving density can be either suppressed or enhanced depending on the relative magnitude of μ and β and the timing of particle decoupling. More specifically, if decoupling occurs during the Gauss-Bonnet era, the comoving density may be either enhanced or suppressed, otherwise, if decoupling occurs during the Randall-Sundrum era, the comoving density is always enhanced.

To determine which parameter combinations lead to suppression, and which lead to enhancement (with respect to the standard cosmology result) we can equate equations [\eqref=eq:ysym] and [\eqref=eq:yinfrs] with [\eqref=eq:yinfst]. Rearranging for μ2, we find that the relic abundance is enhanced for the interval

[formula]

and suppressed for

[formula]

For [formula], the standard expansion rate is restored prior to particle decoupling and the predicted value of ΩDMh2 reduces to the canonical result.

In figure [\ref=fig:musq_omega_varbeta] we plot the predicted relic abundance ΩDMh2 in the general Gauss-Bonnet scenario as a function of μ2 for varying β. Immediately we see that ΩDMh2 (much like the expansion rate H) can be split up into three distinct regions: for small μ2 (and large β), the relic density increases with increasing μ2 (and decreasing β), reaching a maximum that is approximately given by

[formula]

In this region, decoupling occurs during the Gauss-Bonnet expansion era and the relic density can be estimated using [\eqref=eq:ysym]. Next, for [formula], the relic density decreases with increasing μ2 and is relatively independent of β. Here, decoupling occurs during the Randall-Sundrum era and each curve approaches the Randall-Sundrum result [\cite=PhysRevD.70.083531]. Finally, when [formula], each curve reduces to the standard cosmology result. Hence, for the purpose of estimating the relic density, three approximate regimes can be identified:

[formula]

within which equations [\eqref=eq:ysym], [\eqref=eq:yinfrs] and [\eqref=eq:yinfst] for Y∞ would be appropriately used.

As expected, figure [\ref=fig:musq_omega_varbeta] shows that the dark matter relic abundance may be either enhanced or suppressed by up to two or more orders of magnitude, depending on the values of μ2 and β. We must stress, however, that as the value of β is reduced, the predicted relic density tends towards the Randall-Sundrum result, and is therefore enhanced. Also, since [formula] GeV2 is bounded from below by BBN constraints, suppression is only possible if [formula], corresponding to the condition [formula]. Furthermore, it is only for the particular case considered in [\cite=PhysRevD.79.103528], that is β  =  0.1509 (Rm  =  1) (blue curve), that ΩDMh2 is exclusively suppressed. For more reasonable values of β (and Rm) the relic density is typically enhanced.

We can invert these results to find the annihilation cross section required to produce the observed relic density ΩDMh2  =  0.1187. In figure [\ref=fig:musq_sigma_cont_varbeta] we plot this cross section as a function of μ2 for varying β. The cross section, which is inversely proportional to ΩDMh2, exhibits similar behaviour to the relic density curves presented in figure [\ref=fig:musq_omega_varbeta] in that the three regimes - Gauss-Bonnet, Randall-Sundrum and standard - are immediately apparent.

The required cross section in each regime can be estimated by rearranging the approximate expressions [\eqref=eq:ysym], [\eqref=eq:yinfrs] and [\eqref=eq:yinfst] and substituting in the observed relic density ΩDMh2. Thus, if decoupling occurs deep in the Gauss-Bonnet era, the required annihilation cross section is given by

[formula]

Similarly, if decoupling occurs during the Randall-Sundrum era,

[formula]

which is relatively independent of β. For [formula], the transition point xRSt precedes the freeze-out point and we recover the canonical result 〈σv〉≃〈σv〉GR≃2.03  ×  10- 26 cm3s- 1 and 〈σv〉≃〈σv〉GR≃2.21  ×  10- 26 cm3s- 1 for mχ  =  100 GeV and mχ = 10 GeV respectively.

The results in figure [\ref=fig:musq_sigma_cont_varbeta] should be compared with the latest constraints derived from the Fermi-LAT gamma ray data [\cite=Fermi]. For example, the bounds for the χ  →  b and χ  →  μ+μ- annihilation channels for a dark matter particle with mass mχ  =  100 GeV are [formula] cm3s- 1 and [formula] cm3s- 1 respectively. For the mχ  =  10 GeV case the bounds are more stringent with [formula] cm3s- 1 and [formula] cm3s- 1 for the respective channels. The Fermi-LAT constraints therefore exclude a portion of the Gauss-Bonnet parameter space. For the small values of β that correspond to realistic values Rm  >  1, larger values of μ2 are favoured. We must keep in mind however, that these constraints only apply if the dark matter particle annihilates primarily through one of the channels mentioned.

Asymmetric Dark Matter

Asymmetric dark matter models treat the dark matter particle χ and antiparticle [formula] as distinct and with unequal number densities, similar to the asymmetry that exists in the baryonic sector. In fact, these models typically assume [\cite=Kumar] [\cite=Graesser:2011wi] either a primordial asymmetry in one sector that is transferred to the other sector, or that both asymmetries are generated by the same physical process such as the decay of a heavy particle. Connecting the two asymmetries also explains the proximity of the dark and baryonic densities, ΩDM  /  Ωb  ~  5, suggesting the dark matter mass is in the range mχ  ~  5  -  15 GeV [\cite=PhysRevD.79.115016].

When the particle χ and antiparticle [formula] are distinct, the Boltzmann equation [\eqref=eq:boltsym] is generalized to the coupled system where [formula] and [formula] are the equilibrium number densities of the χ and [formula] components respectively. We assume that self annihilations are forbidden, and that only interactions of the type χ  →  XX̄ (where the X's are Standard Model particles) can change the dark matter particle number. We can then write

[formula]

where C is a strictly positive constant that characterizes the asymmetry between the particles and antiparticles. Here, we are not concerned with the mechanism that generates the asymmetry, only that one has been created well before particle freeze-out.

Rewriting the Boltzmann equations in terms of the comoving density Y, and using equation [\eqref=eq:Cdef], the system [\eqref=eq:nchiasym] becomes

[formula]

where, since the dark matter particles and antiparticles are non-relativistic at decoupling,

[formula]

Solving the system [\eqref=eq:dYasym] in the asymptotic limit, the total dark matter density, ΩDMh2, is the sum of the χ and [formula] components,

[formula]

Following similar arguments to those for the symmetric case, we can find an approximate solution to the system [\eqref=eq:dYasym] for the asymptotic density of the [formula] component (see [\cite=Iminniyaz:2011yp] for details)

[formula]

where we use Y∞(sym) to denote the corresponding asymptotic solution for symmetric dark matter. As we saw in the previous section, Y∞(sym) depends on the timing of freeze-out and is given by, respectively, equations [\eqref=eq:yinfst], [\eqref=eq:ysym] and [\eqref=eq:yinfrs] for the three regimes [\eqref=eq:gb_freeze]-[\eqref=eq:st_freeze]. From equations [\eqref=eq:ychibarapp] and [\eqref=eq:Cdef], we readily obtain

[formula]

As discussed in [\cite=Iminniyaz:2011yp] [\cite=Meehan:2014zsa], the contribution from the minority and majority components to the total dark matter density depends sensitively on the ratio C / Y∞(sym). When C / Y∞(sym)  ≫  1, the density of the [formula] component is exponentially suppressed, [formula], and the density of the χ component approaches the asymmetry C, [formula]. Conversely, when C / Y∞(sym)  ≪  1, the factor C drops out of the expressions [\eqref=eq:ychibarapp] and [\eqref=eq:ychiapp] and each component behaves like symmetric dark matter, i.e. [formula]. We designate each of these regimes as being strongly and weakly asymmetric respectively, with the relic density in each case behaving like

[formula]

To determine which parameter values correspond to each regime, we use the results derived in the previous section for symmetric dark matter. There we saw that the relic density was enhanced for the interval [\eqref=eq:enhint],

[formula]

and suppressed for the interval [\eqref=eq:supint]

[formula]

Therefore, for a fixed value of the asymmetry C, these two cases would drive the dark matter species towards the weakly or strongly asymmetric regimes respectively.

Again, we can invert the expressions for the asymptotic comoving densities [\eqref=eq:ychibarapp] and [\eqref=eq:ychiapp] and, using [\eqref=eq:dmtot], find the annihilation cross section required to produce the observed relic density. Then, depending on the timing of freeze-out (see equations [\eqref=eq:gb_freeze]-[\eqref=eq:st_freeze]), the cross section and asymmetry are related via

[formula]

where ω  =  ΩDMh2 / (2.75  ×  108mχ) and a = 1.167  ×  10- 173- 1.

The numerical results for the required annihilation cross section are plotted in figures [\ref=fig:sig_C_cont_varbeta100] and [\ref=fig:sig_C_cont_varbeta10] (solid curves) for mχ  =  100 GeV and mχ  =  10 GeV respectively. The different curves within each panel correspond to different values of μ2 and we have reduced the magnitude of β in the successive panels. In each figure we plot the standard cosmology result (black) for reference.

Initially the curves are vertical and the relic density is determined solely by the annihilation cross section. In this region the ratio C / Y∞(sym) is small and each component behaves like symmetric dark matter. As both the annihilation cross section and the asymmetry increase we transition into a regime which is strongly asymmetric where the curves are horizontal. Here the density of the minority component is exponentially suppressed and the relic abundance is fixed by the asymmetry C. This general behaviour is exhibited regardless of the values of μ2 or β, however, the magnitude of the annihilation cross section which separates the weakly and strongly asymmetric regions depends significantly on the combination of μ2 and β (see [\eqref=eq:sigma_asym]).

Since the vertical section of each curve corresponds to the weakly asymmetric regime, the position of the vertical asymptotes can be deduced simply from figure [\ref=fig:musq_sigma_cont_varbeta] (with allowance for the additional factor of ~  2 due to the χ and [formula] contributions). When the annihilation cross section is enhanced in figure [\ref=fig:musq_sigma_cont_varbeta], the curves in figures [\ref=fig:sig_C_cont_varbeta100] and [\ref=fig:sig_C_cont_varbeta10] will be shifted to the right of the standard cosmology result. Similarly, when the symmetric cross section is suppressed, the asymmetric curves will be shifted towards the left. Thus the symmetric cross section determines the vertical asymptote of the required asymmetric cross section.

Consequently, just like the symmetric case, the required annihilation cross section is reduced for all values of μ2 when β  =  0.1509 (panel 1), getting smaller with decreasing μ2. Then, as the magnitude of β is decreased (in successive panels), the curves are shifted towards larger cross sections. There is a limit however, to how much each curve is shifted for a fixed value of μ2. For example, in figure [\ref=fig:sig_C_cont_varbeta100], the μ2  =  10- 38 GeV2 case (solid blue) is shifted to higher cross sections when β is reduced from β  =  0.1509 to β  =  10- 5 (i.e. going from panel 1 to panel 2). But, as the value of β is reduced further in the successive panels, the curve does not move. A similar thing happens for the μ2  =  10- 44 GeV2 case (solid red) once [formula] (panels 3 and 4). We understand this by noting that once the value of β has dropped below the threshold given in [\eqref=eq:rs_freeze], the behaviour of each curve is given by the Randall-Sundrum result (see [\eqref=eq:sigma_asym]), and is therefore independent of β.

The increased annihilation cross section of the asymmetric dark matter species in the Gauss-Bonnet braneworld scenario gives rise to an interesting prospect, first pointed out in [\cite=Gelmini:2013awa]: if the cross section is large enough, it is possible that the annihilation rate and in turn the indirect detection signal of asymmetric dark matter could be enhanced with respect to the symmetric signal in the standard scenario, despite the suppressed abundance of the minority dark matter component. This behaviour, which is contrary to the usual expectation, is possible in both the quintessence and scalar-tensor scenarios [\cite=Gelmini:2013awa], as well as the Randall-Sundrum braneworld model [\cite=Meehan:2014zsa]. Since we have shown that the required annihilation cross section in the GB braneworld model is increased by up to several orders of magnitude, we would expect similar behviour here also.

Using the formalism developed in [\cite=Meehan:2014zsa], we indicate in figures [\ref=fig:sig_C_cont_varbeta100] and [\ref=fig:sig_C_cont_varbeta10] the regions in the (〈σv〉,C) plane that produce an amplified asymmetric dark matter detection signal (dot-dashed blue curve). To compare our results with experiment, we also show the region excluded by the latest Fermi-LAT data [\cite=Fermi] (dot-dashed purple and magenta curves). Combining the two, the allowed region of parameter space that produces an amplified detection signal is given by

[formula]

where 〈σv〉GR is the required annihilation cross section for symmetric dark matter in the standard cosmological scenario (see section [\ref=sec:sdm]) and γ is a damping factor that arises from the asymmetry between the particles χ and antiparticles [formula], given by (see [\cite=Meehan:2014zsa])

[formula]

Figures [\ref=fig:sig_C_cont_varbeta100] and [\ref=fig:sig_C_cont_varbeta10] show that it is possible to produce an amplified asymmetric detection signal in the Gauss-Bonnet braneworld model, however, the allowed region decreases as the dark matter particle mass drops from mχ  =  100 GeV to mχ  =  10 GeV due to the more stringent Fermi-LAT constraints.

Conclusions

Relic abundance calculations provide an important test of non-standard cosmological scenarios in the early pre-BBN universe (see [\cite=Gelmini:2009yh] for further discussion). In this article we have revisited the relic abundance investigation in the Gauss-Bonnet braneworld scenario in which a Gauss-Bonnet curvature invariant is added to the Randall-Sundrum braneworld action. A previous investigation by [\cite=PhysRevD.79.103528] found that the dark matter density is suppressed in the GB braneworld model, however, this conclusion is based on a highly contrived assumption that collapses the Randall-Sundrum expansion era, leading to a slower early time expansion law. We find that when this assumption is relaxed, the early time expansion rate can be either faster or slower than the standard expansion law, depending on the model parameters. In turn, the dark matter relic abundance is either enhanced or suppressed by up to several orders of magnitude with respect to the standard cosmology result, respectively. Importantly, when realistic parameter values are chosen, the early time expansion rate is typically faster than the standard expansion law during the era of dark matter decoupling and the resulting relic abundance is enhanced. Moreover, in the limit [formula] (corresponding to Rm  ≫  1) the usual Randall-Sundrum type behaviour is recovered [\cite=PhysRevD.70.083531] [\cite=PhysRevD.79.115023].

We have also investigated the GB braneworld effect on asymmetric dark matter species and found that the enhanced annihilation cross section required to provide the observed relic density is capable of producing an amplified annihilation signal with respect to the symmetric signal in the standard cosmological scenario. This effect, which is contrary to the usual expectation, has also been demonstrated in quintessence, scalar-tensor [\cite=Gelmini:2013awa] and Randall-Sundrum braneworld models [\cite=Meehan:2014zsa].

The implications of the latest Fermi-LAT constraints on the dark matter annihilation cross section have been considered for both the symmetric and asymmetric models. For small β, corresponding to realistic values for the mass ratio Rm, larger values of μ2 are favoured, suggesting that the Gauss-Bonnet braneworld expansion rate has reduced to the standard expansion law before dark matter decoupling.

The present investigation is timely because the weak scale cross section relevant to generic relic abundance calculations should be accessible to the next generation of direct and indirect detection experiments [\cite=Bauer:2013ihz]. Therefore, additional constraints and/or an unexpected signal from these experiments could point to new physics in the era prior to BBN.

Our investigation also has implications for dark matter particle models and scans of supersymmetric parameter space. If the early time expansion rate is in fact slower than the standard scenario, particles which are typically overproduced in the standard cosmology and thus ruled out by relic density constraints, may be rescued in the GB scenario.
