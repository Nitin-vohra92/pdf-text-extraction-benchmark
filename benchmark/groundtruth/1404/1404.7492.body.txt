Cosmological Model with Nonminimal Derivative Coupling of Scalar Fields in Five Dimensions

Introduction

Extra dimensions have a special role in physics. At first, its existence was proposed to solve some theoretical problem concerning unification of all physical interactions. Kaluza and Klein proposed one dimensional extra dimension when developed a theory which unified gravity and electromagnetism [\cite=Overduin:1998pn]. The string theory, as a good candidate of unification theory, requires 26 (for bosonic string) and 10 dimensions (for superstring) of spacetime in order to be consistent. The idea of brane which exists in string theory then adopted by physicist to propose the braneworld gravity. The five dimensional braneworld gravity suggests that our four dimensional spacetime in constant time can be viewed as a 3D subspace called 3-brane embedded in five dimensional space called bulk. The matter field is constrained on the brane and the gravitational field can move freely in the bulk [\cite=maartens]. The braneworld model has been studied by Lisa Randall and Raman Sundrum to explain the hierarchy problem between Planck scale and electrowake scale [\cite=RSI] [\cite=RSII]. Gravity on the brane is described by the modified Einstein equation developed by Shiromizu, Maeda, and Sasaki (SMS) [\cite=SMS]. This equation derived from the Einstein equation in the bulk using the Gauss-Codacci equation and Israel's junction condition of the brane. Different from the standard Einstein equation, this equation contains two additional terms related to quadratic term of energy-momentum tensor and the effects of the bulk geometry on the brane. Cosmological application of this equation has been studied extensively, for a review see [\cite=Brax:2003fv] [\cite=Langlois:2002bb]. Modification of the SMS equation with Lorentz invariance violation and its applications in cosmology has been studied in [\cite=arianto1] [\cite=arianto] [\cite=arianto2] [\cite=zen].

Another kind of extradimensional theory of gravity is the universal extra dimension (UED). This model proposes that the matter field is not confined on the brane but can move freely in the bulk [\cite=UED]. This model does not solve the hierarchy problem but provide a very good candidate for the cold dark matter (CDM) and solve the proton stability problem naturally [\cite=Hsieh:2006qe] [\cite=Appelquist:2001mj]. The cosmological aspect of this theory has been studied in [\cite=Bringmann:2003sz] [\cite=Bringmann:2004xt].

In this paper, we study the cosmological aspect of the five dimensional extra dimension (5D UED) model, where the source of dynamics is given by a nonminimal derivative coupling (NMDC) of scalar field and the curvature tensor. The NMDC was introduced by Amendola in [\cite=amendola]. This model has been studied in the context of inflation and late time acceleration [\cite=Capozziello:1999xt] [\cite=capozziello2] [\cite=granda]. The exact cosmological solution of NMDC in four dimensional spacetime has been studied in [\cite=sushkov].

Here, we investigate how the NMDC terms influence the evolution of the four dimensional spacetime and the extra dimension. We consider the NMDC as the quantity that cause the acceleration of the four dimensional spacetime and make the extradimension shrink to a small size. As the results, we see that a solution where the four dimensional spacetime expands with acceleration and the extra dimension shrinks in time can arise naturally in our model.

We organize this paper as follow. After this brief introduction, we setup the basic equations of the model. We give the geometrical quantities of the ansatz metric and setup the Einstein equation based on the Lagrangian of this model in the Section 2. Then, we solve the Einstein equation for a special cases of pure free scalar field and a general case of pure free scalar with pure NMDC. Next, we perform dynamical analysis to determine stability of our model in Section 4. Finally, we give the conclusions in the last section.

Model Setup

Lets start from the action

[formula]

Here, the nonminimal derivative coupling is given in the two last terms of the action.

Taking a variation of this action with respect to the metric, we obtain the Einstein equations in five dimensional spaces as

[formula]

where

[formula]

is the variation of the terms that depend on scalar field φ with respect to metric gAB.

Variation of the action with respect to the scalar field gives us the scalar field equation of motion as

[formula]

The metric for five dimensional universal extradimensions (5D UED) model is [\cite=Bringmann:2003sz],

[formula]

where a = a(t) is the scale factor for three dimensional (3D) common space and b = b(t) is the scale factor for the extra dimension. Here, we choose different scale factors a and b for the the 3D and extra dimension space for simplicity and we choose a flat metric for the 3D space to include recent observational results that our universe is flat [\cite=spergel:2006hy].

From the metric, we get some geometrical quantities i.e the Ricci tensors

[formula]

Ricci scalar,

[formula]

and Einstein tensors

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] are Hubble parameter for three dimensional and extra spaces. The overdot notation defined as derivative with respect to time t.

Field Equation and Its Solution

Now, we are ready to solve the Einsteins equations ([\ref=eq:einstein]). First of all, we make two assumptions concerning the scalar field φ and scale factors a(t) and b(t). First, we consider the scalar that depends on time only, φ  =  φ(t). Second, we impose the condition that the two scale factors related as b = aγ for γ constant, as taken in [\cite=Arianto2011]. This relation gives us [formula].

Substituting geometrical quantities in the last section into eq.([\ref=eq:einstein]) and applying the two assumptions, we get

[formula]

where

[formula]

are constants. The scalar field equation of motion reads,

[formula]

where,

[formula]

are constants.

We see that the field equations contain the third derivative of the scalar field and the second derivative of the Hubble parameter. We can simplify the field equations by choosing a specific condition for ξ and η parameters as follows

[formula]

So we have α2  =  β4  =  ε2  =  0. We can also combine eqs. ([\ref=eq:einstein11]) and ([\ref=eq:einstein55]) as

[formula]

where

[formula]

As a special case, we solve the field equation for ξ = 0. For this case, the field equations reads

[formula]

From eqs. ([\ref=eq:einstein00sec1]) and ([\ref=eq:geraksec1]) we get

[formula]

where [formula], a0, and t0 are constants. Here, for a static extradimension (γ = 0), we have a  =  a0t1 / 3, which is the standard cosmological solution with stiff matter.

Now we are going to study a general case of ξ  ≠  0. For this case, eq. ([\ref=eq:einstein00]) gives

[formula]

or, equivalently

[formula]

Thus, we have two conditions for H and [formula] as follow

[formula]

Solving eqs. ([\ref=eq:einstein1155]) and ([\ref=eq:gerak]) for [formula] and substituting the value of [formula] from ([\ref=eq:phi0]), we get

[formula]

First, lets check the power law solution, [formula], for a constant p. The last equation gives us

[formula]

One can verify that there is no γ value that make p constant for every t. Thus there is no power law solution that valid for all t. The solution of eq. ([\ref=eq:Hdot]) is the de Sitter solution eHt where

[formula]

This result also gives a constraint for ξ and γ i.e. [formula].

Now, we are going to investigate two special cases of large and small Hubble parameter. For a large Hubble parameter, eq. ([\ref=eq:Hdot]); after substituting the value of α1, ε's and λ's; gives us

[formula]

where the solution is

[formula]

with [formula].

Suppose that the Hubble parameter decreases. For ξ > 0 and [formula], we found that [formula] if γ  <   - 5, - 3 < γ <  - 2 (with [formula]), or - 2  ≤  γ <  - 1.42. Then, after the Hubble parameter reach a small value, eq. ([\ref=eq:Hdot]) reduces to

[formula]

The solution for the scale factor is

[formula]

which is equivalent with the case of pure free scalar.

Finally, we are going to study a very special case of our theory where the scalar field is linear in t. For this case, we have [formula] constant. The field equations can be written as

[formula]

From eq. ([\ref=eq:linear00]) we get constant H2, then eq. ([\ref=eq:lineargerak]) gives

[formula]

which is equivalent to eq. ([\ref=eq:deSitter]). Substituting this result to eq. ([\ref=eq:linear00]), we have

[formula]

Requiring φ to be a real field, we have γ <  - 2 or γ >  - 1 for ξ  >  0 and - 2 < γ <  - 1 for ξ  <  0.

Stability Analysis

In this section, we study the stability of dynamical system of this model. Introducing three new variables,

[formula]

the field equations ([\ref=eq:einstein00]) to ([\ref=eq:einstein1155]) dan be written as

[formula]

where the prime denotes the first derivative with respect to N.

The last two equation are an autonomous phase system of the form [formula] where  = (x,y). The critical points 0 of the system comes from the solutions of (0)  =  0. The stability of the critical points are determined by the eigenvalues μi of the matrix M whose components are [formula]. A critical point is called stable (unstable) if [formula] ([formula]) for all i, otherwise it called a saddle point [\cite=Copeland:2006wr].

The first critical point of eqs. ([\ref=eq:x]) and ([\ref=eq:y]) is P  =  (0,0). The M matrix does not have any eigenvalue at P, because the function [formula] are discontinuous at P. Thus, the point P is a saddle point. The second critical point is Q  =  (x1,y1), where

[formula]

and [formula]. This point corresponds to the de Sitter solution, [formula], as in eq. ([\ref=eq:Hdot]). Recalling the value of ε's and λ's from ([\ref=eq:epsilon]) and ([\ref=eq:lambda]), we have

[formula]

Hence, in order to have real (x1,y1), we require

[formula]

Next, we will consider the stability of the Q point by choosing a particular value of γ. For example, we take γ =  - 2, and the component of M matrix are

[formula]

The eigenvalues of the M are determined by the characteristic equation

[formula]

where A1 = 1, [formula] and C1  =  fxgy  -  fygx. The characteristic equation will give us two negative real roots if and only if D1  =  B21  -  4A1C1 > 0, B1  >  0, and C1 > 0. For γ =  - 2, D1 and B1 are positive definite, and C1 will be positive for 1.108  <  ξ < 1.79. For instant, if we choose ξ = 1.6, we have μ1  =   - 0.056 and μ2  =   - 15.94. Hence the point Q is stable.

Conclusion

We have studied the nonminimal derivative coupling of scalar field and curvature tensor in five dimensional universal extra dimension model. Here, we choose 2ξ  +  η = 0 condition to remove higher order derivatives of the scalar field. For a model with only free kinetic term of scalar field, we find the scalar field evolves with velocity proportional to t- 1 and the scale factor evolves as [formula]. Here, we see that a constant extra dimension (γ  =  0) will give us a solution of [formula] which is equal to the standard cosmological solution with stiff matter.

In the general case of pure free scalar field with NMDC, the Hubble parameter evolves as given by ([\ref=eq:Hdot]), from which we get the de Sitter solution with the value of cosmological constant given by [formula]. This solution is equivalent to the case of linear scalar field. We can also choose the γ and ξ parameters, so that the Hubble parameter decreases. In the limit of large Hubble parameter, the scale factor evolves as given in ([\ref=eq:Hbesar]) while in the limit of a small Hubble parameter, the scale factor is equivalent to that of the pure free scalar case. Thus for a static extra dimension (γ = 0) our results are exactly the same as the results of four dimensional case [\cite=sushkov]. But, according to our stability analysis, the case of static extra dimension have no stable point. In order to have a real stable critical point, we require negative γ as in eq. ([\ref=eq:gamma]). It means that the extra dimension, if it exists, have to be shrunk by the expansion of the four dimensional spacetime. The stable critical point of our model corresponds to de Sitter solution.
