This research is partially carried out in the IPM-Isfahan Branch and in part supported by a grant from IPM (No. 92050217).

Introduction

For a given r  ≥  2, an r-uniform Berge-cycle of length n, denoted by Crn, is an r-uniform hypergraph with the core sequence [formula] as the vertices, and distinct edges [formula] such that ei contains vi,vi + 1, where addition is in modulo n. A Berge-cycle of length n in a hypergraph with n vertices is called a Hamiltonian Berge-cycle.

For an r-uniform hypergraph H, the Ramsey number Rk(H) is the minimum integer n such that in every k-edge coloring of Krn there exists a monochromatic copy of H. The existence of such a positive integer is guaranteed by Ramsey's classical result in [\cite=Ramsey]. Recently, the Ramsey numbers of various variations of cycles in uniform hypergraphs have been studied, e.g. see [\cite=hax1] [\cite=hax2] [\cite=OS]. In this regard, Gyárfás et al. proposed the following conjecture for Berge-cycles:

Assume that r  ≥  2 is fixed and n is sufficiently large. Then every (r - 1)-edge coloring of Krn contains a monochromatic Hamiltonian Berge-cycle.

Conjecture [\ref=GLSS] states that for a given r  ≥  2 we have Rr - 1(Crn) = n when n is sufficiently large. The case r = 2 is trivial. The case r = 3 was proved in [\cite=gyarf1]. Recently, Maherani and the author gave a proof for the case r = 4; see [\cite=MO]. To see more results on Conjecture [\ref=GLSS], we refer the reader to [\cite=gyarf1] [\cite=gyarf2] [\cite=GSS] and references therein. In this paper, we show that Conjecture [\ref=GLSS] holds for all r  ≥  5. Together with the above results, this gives a positive answer to Conjecture [\ref=GLSS]. The main result is the following theorem:

Suppose that r  ≥  5 and [formula]. Then in every (r - 1)-edge coloring of Krn there is a monochromatic Hamiltonian Berge-cycle.

The proof

Assume that H is an r-uniform hypergraph. The shadow graph Γ(H) is a graph with vertex set V(H), where two vertices are adjacent if they are covered by at least one edge of H. Consider an (r - 1)-edge coloring of H = Krn with colors [formula] and assume that G = Γ(H). For each edge e = xy of G, we assign a list L(e) of colors of all edges of H containing x and y. The color i∈L(e) is good for an edge e∈E(G) if at least r - 1 edges (of H) of color i contain all vertices of e. We consider a new multi-coloring L* for the edges of G. For each edge e∈E(G), assume that L*(e)  ⊆  L(e) is the set of all good colors for e. Through this note, for each real number x, by ⌊x⌋ we mean the largest integer not greater than x and for each natural number m, assume that [formula]. We will use the following lemma in the proof of Theorem [\ref=main_result]. We will use the following lemma in the proof of Theorem [\ref=main_result].

[\cite=Bondy] Let G be a simple graph and let u and v be nonadjacent vertices in G such that dG(u) + dG(v)  ≥  n. Then G is Hamiltonian if and only if G + uv is Hamiltonian.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=main_result]: Suppose to the contrary that there is no monochromatic Hamiltonian Berge-cycle in a given (r - 1)-edge coloring c of H = Krn with colors [formula]. For each 1  ≤  i  ≤  r - 1, let Wi be the set of all edges e of G = Γ(H) for which i∉L*(e). Using Lemma 2.1 in [\cite=MO], we may assume that the spanning subgraph of G with edge set [formula] is not Hamiltonian. Now consider Si  ⊆  Wi with minimum cardinality such that the spanning subgraph induced by [formula] in G is not Hamiltonian. Assume that Gi and Gci are the spanning subgraphs of G induced by Si and [formula], respectively. For any two non-adjacent vertices x and y of Gci the graph Gci + xy is Hamiltonian and so by Lemma [\ref=H1] we have dGci(x) + dGci(y)  ≤  n - 1. Therefore, for any two adjacent vertices x and y of Gi we have dGi(x) + dGi(y)  ≥  n - 1. For each color 1  ≤  i  ≤  r - 1, assume that Ti and Ri are the sets of all isolated vertices and all vertices with degree at least (n - 1) / 2 of Gi, respectively. Also, assume that [formula]. Clearly for each 1  ≤  i  ≤  r - 1, Qi is an independent set in Gi and [formula]. One can easily see that |Ri|  ≥  |Ti| for each i. Assume to the contrary that for some i we have |Ri| < |Ti|. Let [formula], [formula] and [formula]. Clearly

[formula]

is a Hamiltonian cycle in Gci, a contradiction. By the same argument we have [formula].

For each vertex x∈V(G) and any 1  ≤  i  ≤  r - 1 assume that

[formula]

and di(x) is the number of edges of color i containing x in H. For any [formula] set [formula] and [formula]. We say that a set of vertices S  ⊆  V(G) avoids the set of colors W  ⊆  [r  -  1] if for each i∈W there is a vertex x∈S with [formula] or an edge e = xy for x,y∈S with i∉L*(e). An argument similar to the proof of Claim 2.3 of Theorem 2.2 in [\cite=MO] (set t = 2 and follow the proof) yields the following result:

If there is a subset S  ⊆  V(G) that avoids a set of colors containing at least |S| + 1 colors [formula], then by claim [\ref=losses] there is a subset S'  ⊆  V(G) containing at most r - 1 - |S| vertices that avoids [formula]. Now clearly [formula] avoids

[formula]

.

Let S = {yi}fi = 1  ⊆  V(G) be the largest subset of vertices with |S|  ≤  r - 1 that avoids a set containing |S| colors. Note that it is possible to have [formula]. Without any loss of generality, we may assume that S avoids

[formula]

, which is impossible.

Case 2. [formula] for some f + 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  r - 1 and i  ≠  j. Without any loss of generality, assume that [formula] and let [formula]. If [formula], then r - 2,r - 1∉L*(xy) for any [formula] and so [formula] avoids a set containing at least |S| + 2 colors [formula], which is impossible. Therefore, [formula], [formula] and dGr - 1(x) = dGr - 2(x) = (n - 1) / 2. First let f  ≥  1. Let w = x if yf  ≠  x and [formula], otherwise. Clearly r - 2∉L*(wyf) or r - 1∉L*(wyf) and so [formula] avoids a set containing at least |S| + 1 colors, which is impossible by the maximality of S. Therefore, we may assume that f = 0. Since dGr - 1(x) = dGr - 2(x) = (n - 1) / 2, dGr - 1(x) + dGr - 1(y)  ≥  n - 1 for each y∈NGr - 1(x) (also, dGr - 2(x) + dGr - 2(y)  ≥  n - 1 for each y∈NGr - 2(x)) we have NGi(x)  ⊆  Ri for i = r - 2,r - 1. Hence |Rr - 1|,|Rr - 2|  ≥  (n + 1) / 2, [formula] and [formula]. Therefore, for each 1  ≤  i  ≤  r - 3, [formula] or [formula] and with the same argument we conclude that [formula] for each 1  ≤  i  ≤  r - 1. Since f = 0, we have [formula] for any 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  r - 1 and so [formula], which is impossible.

We choose distinct vertices x and {yi}r - 1i = 1 with desired properties mentioned in Claim [\ref=claime1] and maximum f. In the sequel, for simplicity we denote UI(x) and [formula] (for I  ⊆  [r  -  1]) by UI and [formula], respectively. Since f is maximum, it is easy to see that [formula] for any f + 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  r - 1 and i  ≠  j. Without loss of generality assume that,

[formula]

Let [formula]. In the rest of our proof we define a Hamiltonian graph Γ with V(Γ) = V(H), in such a way that every Hamiltonian cycle C of Γ can be extended to a monochromatic Hamiltonian Berge-cycle of H. For this, we consider the following cases:

Case 1. f = r - 2. Consider a graph Γ with vertex set V(Γ) = V(H) and edge set [formula], where Ei's are defined as follows:

[formula]. For each uv∈E1, set [formula] and F1  =  {euv|uv∈E1}.

[formula].

For every [formula], apart from at most [formula] choices of [formula] the edges [formula] of H are of color r - 1. Thus [formula]. Also, for each 1  ≤  i  ≤  r - 2 we have dΓ(yi) = n - (r - 2). One can easily see that Dirac's condition implies that the graph Γ is Hamiltonian; see [\cite=Bondy].

Now we show that every Hamiltonian cycle in Γ can be extended to a monochromatic Hamiltonian Berge-cycle in H. Suppose that [formula] are the vertices of a Hamiltonian cycle C in Γ. For each [formula], we define an edge fi∈E(H) of color r - 1 in the same order their subscripts appear so that {vi,vi + 1}  ⊆  fi and [formula] make a Hamiltonian Berge-cycle with the core sequence [formula]. Set fi = evivi + 1∈F1 for vivi + 1∈E1. Now let vivi + 1∈E2. Set [formula] of color r - 1, where [formula] and fi  ≠  fj for every j < i. Such an edge exists since at least [formula] edges of color r - 1 contain [formula], and {vi,vi + 1} has been used in at most 2(r - 3) + 1 edges fj's for j < i.

Case 2. f  ≤  r - 3. Now let

[formula]

Clearly, there are at most [formula] edges in M of color i for each f + 1  ≤  i  ≤  r - 1. On the other hand, at most [formula] edges in M are of color i for every 1  ≤  i  ≤  f. Therefore,

[formula]

Now let [formula]. Then

[formula]

where [formula]. Therefore, f(s)  ≤  0 where

[formula]

Clearly f(x) is an increasing function, since its derivative is positive for every x. Since s  ≥  (r - f - 2)(r - 1), [formula] and [formula], we have

[formula]

[formula]

a contradiction. Hence [formula].

Assume that [formula] for every f + 2  ≤  i  ≤  r - 1 and [formula]. Clearly l  ≤  r - 2. Let U be the set of all vertices [formula], for which the edge [formula] is of color f + 1. It is easy to see that [formula]. Let U be partitioned into [formula], where [formula], [formula] and [formula] for every 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  r - 2 where i,j  ≠  f + 1. Consider a graph Γ with vertex set V(Γ) = V(H) and edge set [formula], where Ei's are defined as follows:

Let [formula]. For each uv∈E1, set [formula] and F1  =  {euv|uv∈E1}.

Let E2  =  {yiv|v∈Ai,1  ≤  i  ≤  r - 1} and for each yiv∈E2, set [formula]. Also, let F2  =  {eyiv|yiv∈E2}.

Let Γ1 be the graph with vertex set V(Γ) and edge set [formula]. For each 1  ≤  i  ≤  l assume that [formula] and set ti = 0 if dΓ1(ui) > 2r and ti = 2r + 1 - dΓ1(ui), otherwise. Now we show that there are [formula] distinct edges [formula] (where 1  ≤  i  ≤  l and 1  ≤  j  ≤  ti) of color f + 1 with ui∈eij such that for each 1  ≤  i  ≤  l there exist ti distinct vertices [formula]. For this, set r11 = 0, [formula] and [formula] and follow the following step for [formula].

Step i: For each 1  ≤  j  ≤  ti, since [formula], there is an edge eij∉Eij of color f + 1 which contains ui and a vertex [formula]. Now set ri(j + 1) = rij + 1, [formula] and [formula] and continue the above procedure. We apply the above procedure ti times to find the edges eij and the vertices vij for 1  ≤  j  ≤  ti with desired properties. Finally let r(i + 1)1 = riti + 1, [formula] and E(i + 1)1 = Ei(ti + 1) and go to Step i + 1.

Clearly [formula] contains [formula] distinct edges eij with desired properties. Now set [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula].

Assume that [formula] and [formula], where Γ2 is the graph with vertex set V(Γ) and edge set [formula]. For each 1  ≤  i  ≤  r if dΓ2(wi) > 2r, then set t'i = 0. Otherwise, set t'i = 2r + 1 - dΓ2(wi). Also, set [formula]. An argument similar to one used in the definition of E3 shows that there are [formula] distinct edges [formula] (where 1  ≤  i  ≤  r and 1  ≤  j  ≤  t'i) of color f + 1 with wi∈e'ij such that for each 1  ≤  i  ≤  r there exist t'i distinct vertices [formula]. Now, set [formula], E'i  =  {wiv'ij|1  ≤  j  ≤  t'i}, F'i  =  {e'ij|1  ≤  j  ≤  t'i}, [formula] and [formula].

[formula].

Assume that [formula] are degrees of the vertices of Γ. We show that d1 > 2r and dn - i  ≥  n - i for each [formula]. Therefore, Chvátal's condition implies the existence of a Hamiltonian cycle in Γ. Clearly, dΓ(x)  ≥  n - 4r3. Let Di be the set of all edges of color i containing the vertices of [formula] for each i  ≠  f + 1,r - 1 and let

[formula]

Clearly [formula] and so [formula]. For every [formula], apart from at most r - 2 choices of [formula], we have uv∈E1. So dΓ(u) > n - 2r, where [formula]. On the other hand, [formula] and so di > n - 2r for [formula]. Because of [formula], we have di > n - 2r for [formula]. On the other hand, for every [formula] (also, [formula] for each f + 2  ≤  i  ≤  r - 2), apart from at most [formula] choices of [formula] we have uv∈E1 and so [formula]. Hence [formula] for i  ≥  ⌊(n + 3) / 2⌋. Since yiv∈E(Γ) for each v∈Ai, we have dΓ(yr - 1) > n / 2 and dΓ(yi) > 2r for each 1  ≤  i  ≤  r - 1 and i  ≠  f + 1. Hence di > n / 2 for i  ≥  ⌊(n + 1) / 2⌋. Moreover, for every [formula], we have dΓ(ui)  ≥  dΓ1(ui) + ti > 2r.

Now let [formula] with [formula], where Γ2 is the graph with vertex set V(Γ) and edge set [formula] and [formula]. We show that dΓ(wr + 1)  ≥  dΓ2(wr + 1) > 2r and so by the definition of E4 we conclude that

[formula]

For [formula], consider

[formula]

For every 1  ≤  i  ≤  m, suppose that ni is the number of edges of color f + 1 in Ni. Clearly dΓ2(wi)  ≥  ni. Among all mk edges in [formula] there are at most [formula] edges of color i for i  ≠  f + 1,r - 1 and (r - 2)k edges of color r - 1. Hence [formula] If dΓ2(wr + 1)  ≤  2r, then [formula]. Therefore

[formula]

which is impossible since [formula]. Thus dΓ(wr + 1)  ≥  dΓ2(wr + 1) > 2r and consequently dΓ(wi) > 2r for r + 1  ≤  i  ≤  m. On the other hand, according to the definition of Γ, we have dΓ(wi)  ≥  dΓ2(wi) + t'i > 2r for each 1  ≤  i  ≤  r and so min {dΓ(wi)|1  ≤  i  ≤  m} > 2r.

Based on the previous discussions, d1 > 2r and dn - i  ≥  n - i for each [formula]. Now, Chvátal's condition implies the existence of a Hamiltonian cycle in Γ.

We show that every Hamiltonian cycle in Γ can be extended to a monochromatic Hamiltonian Berge-cycle of color f + 1 in H. Suppose that [formula] are the vertices of a Hamiltonian cycle C in Γ. Now for each [formula], we define an edge fi∈E(H) of color f + 1 in the same order their subscripts appear so that {vi,vi + 1}  ⊆  fi and [formula] make a Hamiltonian Berge-cycle with the core sequence [formula]. First, let 1  ≤  i  ≤  n - 2. If vivi + 1∈Ej for some j∈{1,2}, set fi = evivi + 1∈Fj. Set fi = ekj∈F3 for {vi,vi + 1}  =  {uk,vkj} and ukvkj∈E3 where [formula] and 1  ≤  j  ≤  tk. Also, set fi = e'kj∈F4 for {vi,vi + 1}  =  {wk,v'kj} and wkv'kj∈E4 where [formula] and 1  ≤  j  ≤  t'k. Now let i = n - 1. Since {vn - 1,x} has been used in at most one of the edges fi's, where 1  ≤  i  ≤  n - 2 (only possibly in fn - 2) and f + 1∈L*(vn - 1x), then we can choose an appropriate edge fn - 1 of color f + 1 where fn - 1  ≠  fi for each 1  ≤  i  ≤  n - 2. Similarly, for i = n, since {x,v1} has been used in at most one of the edges fi's, where 1  ≤  i  ≤  n - 1 (only possibly in f1) and f + 1∈L*(xv1), then we can choose an appropriate edge fn of color f + 1.
