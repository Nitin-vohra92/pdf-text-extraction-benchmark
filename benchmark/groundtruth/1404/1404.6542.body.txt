Groups of components of Néron models of Jacobians and Brauer groups

Introduction

Let K be a non-archimedean local field. Thus K is a complete discrete valuation field with finite residue field k. Let [formula] be the maximal unramified extension of K. Let X be a proper, smooth, and geometrically connected curve over K, and [formula] be the corresponding curve over [formula]. Let δ and δ' denote, respectively, the index and the period of X, and let [formula] and [formula] denote the corresponding quantities associated to [formula]. Let A be the Jacobian variety of X over K, [formula] the k-group scheme of connected components of the Néron model of A, and [formula] the corresponding Tamagawa number of A at K. Consider the Brauer-Grothendieck group [formula]. Let [formula] denote the image of [formula], and [formula] denote the kernel of [formula]. In this paper, we prove

There exists an exact sequence

[formula]

where [formula].

It follows that

[formula] is a finite group of order [formula].

Corollary [\ref=mc] has an interesting application. To explain this, consider a global field K. Thus K is either a finite extension of [formula] i.e. a number field, or is finitely generated and of transcendence degree 1 over a finite field k i.e. a function field. In the number field case, let U denote a nonempty open subscheme of [formula], and in the function field case, let U denote a nonempty open subscheme of the unique, smooth, complete, and irreducible curve V over k whose function field is K. Consider a regular, connected scheme X of dimension 2 with a proper morphism π:X  →  U such that its generic fiber [formula] is a smooth and geometrically connected curve over K. Let S be the set of primes of K not corresponding to a point of U, and [formula] be the separable algebraic closure of K. Note that S contains all archimedean primes of K in the number field case, and that it may be empty in the function field case. For each prime [formula], let Kv denote the completion of K at v, and let [formula]. Let δ and δ' be, respectively the index and period of X while δv and δv' be the corresponding quantities associated to Xv. It is known that δv  ≠  1 for only finitely many primes v, and that either δv  =  δv' or δv = 2δv' [\cite=licht:duality]. Let [formula] denote the Brauer group of X and define [formula] by the exactness of the sequence

[formula]

Now let A / K be the Jacobian variety of X over K, and denote by [formula] the Shafarevich-Tate group of A / K. Generalizing the work of Artin [\cite=tate:BSD] and Milne [\cite=milne:brauer], Gonzalez-Aviles has shown [\cite=gonzalez:brauer] that

Suppose that the integers δv' are pairwise co-prime and that [formula] contains no nonzero infinitely divisible elements. Then there is an exact sequence

[formula]

in which T0, T1, T2 and T3 are finite groups of orders

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

Here d' is the number of primes v for which δv = 2δv'. In particular, if one of [formula] or [formula] is finite, then so is the other, and their orders are related by

[formula]

Now let [formula] be the maximal unramified extension of Kv, and [formula] be the fiber over [formula], with index [formula] and period [formula]. Let [formula] be the image of the map [formula], and [formula] be the kernel of the map [formula]. Let [formula] the Tamagawa number of A at v. Note that Theorem [\ref=main] applies to Xv. Combining Corollary [\ref=mc] with Theorem [\ref=gon], we obtain

Suppose that the integers δv' are pairwise co-prime, and [formula] is finite. Then

[formula]

where M is a rational number given by

[formula]

Of course, the left-hand term in the above formula appears in the statement of the well-known Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture.

The hypothesis that the integers δv' are pairwise coprime in Theorem [\ref=gon] can be dropped when K is a function field, and [formula]. More precisely, assume that the curve V / k introduced above is also geometrically connected, and consider X to be a smooth, proper, and geometrically connected surface endowed with a proper and flat morphism f:X  →  V whose generic fiber is [formula]. In this case, it is shown in [\cite=llr2] that if, for some prime l, the l-part of the group [formula] or of the group [formula] is finite, then

[formula]

and [formula] is a square. It follows that, in this case, we get

[formula]

where the rational number N is given by

[formula]

Preliminaries

Component Groups, Tamagawa numbers

Let K be a complete, discretely valued field with finite residue field k. Let A / K be an abelian variety over K, and let A be the Néron model [\cite=blr] of A / K over [formula]. The closed fiber Ak of A is a k-group scheme, not necessarily connected. Let A0k be the connected component of Ak containing the identity. Over [formula], there is an exact sequence of group schemes

[formula]

where the quotient [formula] is a finite, étale group scheme over k. Equivalently, [formula] is a finite abelian group with a continuous action of [formula] on it. The group scheme [formula] is called the component group of A. The group of rational points [formula], called the arithmetic component group of A, counts the number of connected components of Ak which are geometrically connected and [formula] is called the Tamagawa number of A / K. Now let [formula] be the maximal unramified extension of K. The inclusion [formula] induces a map [formula], whose kernel corresponds to the unramified subgroup of H1(K,A). The map may also be given as [formula] where, [formula] denotes the Weil-Châtelet group of A over K. We denote this kernel by [formula] and call it the group of Tamagawa torsors of A over K [\cite=biswas].

There exists a canonical isomorphism of finite abelian groups

[formula]

The inflation-restriction sequence

[formula]

identifies the set of Tamagawa torsors with the injective image of the group [formula] in H1(K,A). There is an isomorphism [\cite=milne:duality] [formula] and the latter group is finite, since [formula] is finite.

Suppose that A / K is a Jacobian variety. Then there exists a canonical perfect pairing of finite abelian groups

[formula]

In particular, [formula] has order [formula].

This follows from Theorem [\ref=tt], the fact that A is a self-dual abelian variety, and the perfectness of the pairing [\cite=mcc] induced by Grothendieck's pairing [\cite=mcc].

Thus, for any Jacobian variety A / K, there is an isomorphism

[formula]

of finite, abelian groups.

Since [formula] is finite, its Herbrand quotient is 1 which implies that [formula]. Thus, for any abelian variety A / K (and not just Jacobians), it follows from Theorem [\ref=tt] that [formula].

Picard Groups, Jacobian Varieties, and Brauer Groups

Let X be a smooth, projective, geometrically connected curve defined over any field K. Let [formula] be a separable closure of K, and let [formula]. Let [formula] be the group of divisors of [formula] i.e. the free abelian group generated by the points of [formula]. Note that [formula], where [formula]. There is a natural summation map [formula] whose image is [formula], where δ is the index of X. Equivalently, δ is the least positive degree of a divisor in [formula]. Let [formula] be the Picard scheme of X so that [formula]. It follows that [formula]. The Picard scheme is a smooth group scheme over K whose identity component [formula] is called the Jacobian variety of X. There is an exact sequence of GK-modules

[formula]

where deg is the degree map on [formula]. Taking GK-invariants of [\ref=e0], we obtain the exact sequence

[formula]

where δ' is the period of X. Equivalently, δ' is the least positive degree of a divisor class in [formula]. The image of the map [formula] is denoted by [formula]. Furthermore, it is known that [formula]. Let [formula] be the Brauer-Grothendieck group of X. By Lemma 2.2 in [\cite=milne:brauer], there is an exact sequence

[formula]

The zero on the right-hand end follows from [\cite=milne:duality].

The Main Theorem

In this section, we prove

Let X be a proper, smooth, geometrically connected curve over a non-archimedean local field K having finite residue field k, with index δ and period δ'. Let [formula] be the corresponding curve over [formula], with index [formula] and period [formula]. Let [formula] denote the image of [formula], and [formula] denote the kernel of the map [formula]. Let A be the Jacobian variety of X over K. Then there exists an exact sequence

[formula]

where [formula] is the component group of A, and [formula].

The short exact sequence

[formula]

over K and [formula] gives rise, respectively, to the exact rows of the commutative diagram

[formula]

The colums in the diagram are induced by the inclusion [formula]. The image of the map [formula] is, by definition, [formula] while that of [formula] is [formula]. Thus we have the diagram

[formula]

Since [formula] divides δ', the leftmost vertical map is surjective. The kernel of this map is [formula] where [formula] . The middle vertical map has kernel [formula] by Theorem [\ref=tt]. The kernel of the rightmost vertical map is [formula]. Snake Lemma then gives an exact sequence

[formula]

We now describe the right-most term in the exact sequence [\ref=e1]. Consider the commutative diagram

[formula]

where the top and bottom row are obtained by applying [\ref=pb] to X and [formula] respectively. Since [formula] [\cite=serre:localfields], the above diagram reduces to

[formula]

Snake Lemma then yields the exact sequence

[formula]

which yields the isomorphism

[formula]

The exact sequence [\ref=e1] can now be given as

[formula]

Dualizing this sequence, we obtain

[formula]

Here [formula] denotes the Pontryagin dual of M. By [\ref=ttdual], [formula]. On the other hand, the homomorphism [formula] has order d and generates [formula], so that [formula]. Thus [\ref=e3] can be given as

[formula]

The following corollary is immediate

The quotient group [formula] is finite of order [formula].

By [\cite=thelene:skoro](which applies to any proper, smooth, geometrically integral variety and not just a curve), the quotient group [formula] is finite. The order, however, does not seem to be recorded in the literature.

Suppose that [formula] (this happens, for example, if X has a K-rational point). Then there exists a canonical perfect pairing of finite abelian groups

[formula]

[formula] implies that d = 1. The exact sequence [\ref=e2] shows that, in this case, there exists a canonical isomorphism

[formula]

The pairing of the statement is then induced by the pairing of Corollary [\ref=ttorder].

Theorem [\ref=mt] shows that [formula] can be expressed as the product of [formula] and [formula]. On the other hand, Theorem 1.17 in [\cite=bl] expresses [formula] as the product of a term [formula] and [formula] (Note that the notations for δ and [formula] are different in [\cite=bl]). Both [formula] and [formula] are certain subgroups of the group of Weil divisors on X with support in the special fiber Xk. Letting g be the genus of X, we have that q = 1 if δ divides g - 1, and q = 2 otherwise. As D. Lorenzini explained to us, by [\cite=licht:duality], δ / q = δ' so that [formula]. The commutative diagram in the proof of [\cite=licht:duality] then implies that since [formula], we have [formula]. Thus we have [formula]. It follows that [formula]. Furthermore, comparing Cor [\ref=cor2] with Cor 1.12 in [\cite=bl] yields the isomorphism

[formula]

when d = 1.

The surjective map [formula] in Theorem [\ref=mt] can be made explicit. Consider the commutative diagram

[formula]

Here α1 is an isomorphism via the canonical perfect pairing of finite abelian groups [formula] [\cite=mcc] which in turn is induced by Grothendieck's pairing [formula] [\cite=mcc]. The map α3 is an isomorphism as explained in the proof of Theorem [\ref=mt] above. Finally, the horizontal map α2 is induced by the injective map [formula] in the exact sequence [\ref=e2]. Note that Δ is induced by the connecting homomorphism of the long exact sequence induced by the exact sequence [formula] over [formula]. If [formula], then the composition [formula] is the homomorphism σ:1  ↦  〈x,Δ(1)〉. Since [formula] is generated by [formula], σ = mα for some 0 < m  ≤  d  -  1. Then α3(σ) = m, and we let β(x) = m. On the other hand, the injective map [formula] in Theorem [\ref=mt] is induced by [formula]. As shown in the proof of Theorem [\ref=mt] above, the map [formula] is the restriction of the map H1(K,A)  →  H1(K,P) to [formula], and the latter map is induced by the surjective map A  →  P. Finally, the isomorphism [formula] is induced by the map [formula] as in [\ref=pb]. The map ψ is described explicitly in [\cite=milne:brauer].
