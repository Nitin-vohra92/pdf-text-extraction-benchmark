Relativistic dynamics compels a thermalized Fermi gas to a unique intrinsic parity eigenstate

Introduction

Dirac invented his relativistic equation in order to explain the quantum properties of the electron (spin 1 / 2) in the relativistic framework: the equation had to (a) display the formula E2p = p2 + m2 as the eigenenergy of a particle in free motion (with [formula]); (b) be covariant under a Lorentz transformation that links the particle dynamical properties between two inertial frames. Dirac found that the sound equation had to be expressed, necessarily, in terms of 4  ×  4 matrices. Its more familiar form is [formula], with the Hamiltonian being linear in the momentum [formula],

[formula]

and the 4  ×  4 matrices [formula] and [formula], have to satisfy forcefully the relations

[formula]

with [formula] for the unit matrix (in Dirac's book [\cite=dirac], instead of [formula] we find a 4  ×  4 matrix [formula] multiplying the 4  ×  4 direct product of Pauli matrices [formula]). An usual approach consists in the introduction of the chiral representation, where the components of the matrix vector, [formula] and [formula], are respectively in contravariant and covariant forms, in the same fashion that one has [formula] and [formula] [\cite=cottingham]. The state vector solution to the Dirac equation can be written as the sum,

[formula]

of left and right chiral spinors and [formula], [formula]. From Dirac equation plus Eq. ([\ref=hamdirac]) and ([\ref=state1] one constructs two coupled differential equations for the spinors [formula] and [formula],

[formula]

whose Lagrangian is [\cite=cottingham] (omitting the explicit dependence on x),

[formula]

Interestingly, the Dirac equation allows a different insight when written in terms of direct (or Kronecker) products of Pauli matrices. So, daring to interpret quantum mechanics as a special kind of information theory for particles and fields [\cite=nota2] [\cite=iwo], in the language of quantum information we may say that the relativistic equation of a spin-1/2 fermion has as solution a state of two qubits (two degrees of freedom) carried by a massive particle whose dynamical evolution in space is represented by a continuous variables that may be the position or the linear momentum [\cite=salomon] [\cite=salomon2]. Hereon we will choose the linear momentum representation (as a c-number) instead of using the position operator [formula], since we are not introducing a position dependent potential in the Hamiltonian. One can appreciate that fact by writing the matrices [formula] and [formula] in terms of tensor products of Pauli matrices

[formula]

where the upperscripts 1 and 2 refer to qubits 1 and 2, respectively. Thus we write the Dirac Hamiltonian ([\ref=hamdirac]) in terms of the direct product of two-qubit operators, [formula], and the two solutions to Dirac equation are

[formula]

where s = 0 and 1 stand respectively for negative and positive energy solutions, [formula], with [formula]. The state [formula] is a spinor representing the spatial motion of the free fermion ([formula] in the momentum representation) coupled to its spin, which describes a structureless magnetic dipole moment. For qubit 1 the kets, [formula] and | - 〉1, are identified as the intrinsic parity eigenstates of the fermion. The states are orthogonal, [formula]. For the inner product we get [formula], with the normalization factor

[formula]

and we also assume that the local probability distribution for the momenta is normalized, [formula]. Thus the spinors and 4  ×  4 matrices stand for the the direct product of the intrinsic degrees of freedom of a massive spin-1/2 fermion, parametrized by the linear momentum [formula], on free motion in space. Since [formula], one has [formula] that leads to Einstein's dispersion relation p2 + m2 = E2p. As so, the state ([\ref=sol1]) has no definite intrinsic parity, qubit 1 is in a superposition of both eigenstates.

The total parity operator P̂ acts on the Kronecker product [formula] as [formula]; indeed it is the product of two operators, the intrinsic parity P̂int (having two eigenvalues, [formula]) and the spatial parity P̂sp ([formula]). Thus, [formula] applies on [formula], Eq. ([\ref=sol1] ), and it follows that P̂- 1  =  P̂. Regarding the spatial parity operator the +   (-  ) sign stands for axial (polar) vectors. Complementarily, the γ-matrices are [formula], [formula] , i = 1,2,3, and [formula].

Correlation between the intrinsic degrees of freedom

There is an asymmetry between the two terms within the brackets in the solution ([\ref=sol1]): the first one represents the limit for the non-relativistic state of a spin 1 / 2 free fermion, namely, the solution to the Schrödinger equation, while the second term is responsible for the relativistic effect (containing the helicity operator [formula]). Due to the correlation between the parity and helicity qubits, a hypothetical measurement that results in qubit [formula] would reduces the Dirac solution to the non-relativistic Schrödinger equation while if the result of the measurement is qubit [formula] the solution is reduced to the purely relativistic term. However, there is no hint that the nature selects one of the two components under any kind of measurement. Nevertheless, as we are going to see below, for an ensemble of fermions in contact with a thermal reservoir, one intrinsic parity eigenstate will be selected naturally as an effect of cooling.

The helicity eigenvalue equation [formula] has orthogonal eigenstates

[formula]

([formula], [formula]) where the angles θ and φ determine the direction of p̂ (on a spherical surface of radius 1 the tips of the versors p̂ and -  p̂ are localized by the angles [formula] and [formula]) and the kets [formula], [formula] stand for [formula] and [formula]. So, the spinor [formula] can be written as the superposition

[formula]

(we omit the subscript 2) where [formula] is the density distribution of the linear momentum. The spinor ([\ref=h]) correlates the linear momentum (a c-number) to the helicity eigenstates, however, for simplicity, we are going to assume that the linear momentum is not correlated to the helicity, therefore

[formula]

where a mixing angle, [formula], and a relative phase, [formula]
