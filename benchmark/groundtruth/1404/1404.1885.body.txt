Signatures of Coherent Electronic Quasiparticles in the Paramagnetic Mott Insulator.

The concept of electronic quasiparticles is one of the most basic paradigms in the description of the dense interacting electron system found in any metallic atomic crystal. In terms of quasiparticles even superficially very strongly interacting systems may be described through elementary excitations that are in direct correspondence with those of a non-interacting electron gas. This allows for a relatively simple description of thermodynamic and transport properties, as well as the inclusion of interactions between quasiparticles and phonons which is the basis of the standard theory of superconductivity as a condensate of paired quasiparticles.

The basic theory of quasiparticles is well understood within the framework of quantum many particle physics[\cite=NegeleOrland] where the distribution of single electron excitations at (crystal) momentum [formula] and energy ω ([formula]) are described by the spectral function [formula]. The object that captures the effects of interactions is the self energy [formula] in terms of which the spectral function can be expressed as [formula]. Here [formula] is the bare band energy of the system and μ is the chemical potential and we have assumed a single band which is isolated from any other effects than those of intraband electron-electron interactions. In a Fermi liquid the quasiparticles are objects that close to the Fermi energy, at energy [formula] solves [formula]. These are characterized by a lifetime [formula], quasiparticle weight [formula], and effective mass. The quasiparticle weight [formula] quantifies how much of the spectral weight at momentum [formula] is carried by the Landau quasiparticle and will be manifest as the characteristic discontinuity at T = 0 in the occupation number [formula] which defines the Fermi surface.

For an interacting electron system it can be understood in perturbation theory how the quasiparticles are a consequence of phase space constraints for scattering which gives a vanishing ImΣ(ω = 0) = 0 and a correspondingly divergent lifetime of quasiparticles at the Fermi energy.[\cite=NegeleOrland]

In contrast a Mott insulator is a system that from the band structure considerations would be a metal but which has been driven insulating by electron-electron interactions.[\cite=Mott] The defining feature of the insulator is exactly that there are no low energy electronic quasiparticles, instead there is a gap in the spectral function around the Fermi energy. In its cleanest form (without broken translational symmetry) the Mott insulator is a non-Fermi liquid in the sense that the self energy diverges at small ω, and electronic quasiparticles are thus always unexpected. Quasiparticles, if found, would be of fundamental importance and might also provide a setting for theories of more exotic states in strongly correlated systems.

In this paper we study the Mott insulator in infinite dimensions within dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) [\cite=George_review] [\cite=DMFT1] [\cite=DMFT2] [\cite=DMFT] [\cite=DMFT3], for the standard case of the single band paramagnetic Hubbard model with a semi-circular density of states. Although this is a much studied[\cite=IPT] [\cite=ED] [\cite=Local_moment] [\cite=NRG] [\cite=strong_coupling] [\cite=Nishimoto] [\cite=DMRG_Garcia] [\cite=Karski_DMRG] [\cite=Dist-ED] [\cite=Lu] and by now perhaps the archetypical model of a Mott insulator (and Mott transition), we a found evidence that a basic feature of the spectral function may be missing in most earlier studies; namely that it may contain well defined electronic quasiparticles at the gap edge. We have used a stochastic non-perturbative method, "distributional exact diagonalization" (Dist-ED)[\cite=Dist-ED] which can give exceptionally high resolution of the self energy over the full band width. The method in brief consists of calculating the self energy of the DMFT (Anderson) impurity problem as a sample average over representative but stochastically generated finite size impurity models that are solved by exact diagonalization. In standard fashion a finite shift η  >  0 away from the real axis is used in order to generate a continuous function from a finite set of poles, but due to the natural parallelization of the present method, millions or even billions of poles can be generated which allows for the use of very small η. Quasiparticles are found only at η  ≤  0.001 (in units of half bare band width) and for not too large U, suggesting that both of these aspects, non-perturbative and high resolution, are crucial to the result. In order to see this feature it is thus necessary to be able solve the DMFT equations non-perturbatively and very close to the real axis which is difficult with other methods at the high energies related to the Mott gap.

The main result of the paper, as shown in Figure [\ref=delta001_delta01], is the sharp peaks in the local density of states and the imaginary part of the self energy for small η = 0.001 at the inner edge of the Hubbard bands, a feature that is not found for larger η = 0.1. In Figure [\ref=sigma_dosU4] it is shown that this edge peak derives from an actual quasiparticle solution ω - ReΣ  -  ε = 0, for a narrow window of ω values and a range of bare band-energies ε. The corresponding energy resolved spectral function, [formula], shows narrow dispersing bands (Fig. [\ref=dispersion]) together with the broad incoherent weight. An important conclusion, as demonstrated in Figures [\ref=sigma_of_delta] and [\ref=DMFT_iteration], is that the quasiparticle solutions are only observed if the DMFT self consistency cycle is performed very close to the real axis, and in Figure [\ref=delta01_DMRG] that the small and large η solutions are qualitatively different. This difference can be linked to a small energy scale (see Figure [\ref=e_scale]) of separation between spectral weight, A(ω), and scattering, ImΣ(ω), which is a non-perturbative outcome from exact diagonalization. This energy scale is diminished at large U such that the known strong coupling form[\cite=strong_coupling] (Fig. [\ref=various_U]) of the Hubbard bands is asymptotically reached. Comparing to calculations using a continuous time quantum Monte Carlo (CT-QMC) impurity solver[\cite=triqs] (Fig. [\ref=QMC_compare]) on imaginary frequencies show that the small η solutions are in agreement within statistical error with the QMC calculations.

Similar sharp peaks as found in our study have been reported before in various forms but are difficult to distinguish from peaks due to finite resolution of poles. In the metallic phase, there is quite strong evidence that such gap edge peaks do appear.[\cite=Karski_DMRG] [\cite=Lu] Also, in the antiferromagnetic case such features have been observed, where they might (at least physically) be understood in terms of coupling to low energy magnon modes.[\cite=Sangiovanni] One study, by Nishimoto et al.[\cite=Nishimoto] using dynamical density-matrix renormalization group (D-DMRG)[\cite=DDMRG] finds additional peak structure even in the insulting paramagnetic phase, although the details of the self-energy is not explored. As our study is limited to small system sizes with number of levels ns  =  3, 5, or 7, the qualitatively similar results in the D-DMRG study with ns  ~  O(200) is reassuring. Nevertheless, other more recent studies do not find quasiparticles in the Mott insulating state and it seems fair to say that this is still an open question.[\cite=Karski_DMRG] [\cite=Lu] [\cite=Ganahl]

Model and method

The model studied is the single band Hubbard model with on-site interaction quantified by U but treated in infinite dimensions where it can be exactly mapped to a quantum impurity with a momentum independent self energy.[\cite=George_review] We additionally assume that there is no broken symmetry such that there is no magnetic or charge order.

At half-filling, μ = U / 2, and using a semi-circular bare density of states [formula] (|ε|  ≤  1) of bandwidth 2, the local interacting Greens function (for one spin species) is [formula], which can be integrated to the form

[formula]

with Δ[G] = (1 / 4)G. Here Σ[G] is the self energy of the corresponding Anderson impurity specified by interaction U and chemical potential μ on the impurity site, and hybridization between impurity and continuum Δ[G]. The challenging task is to solve for the self energy, or equivalently, the interacting Green's function of the impurity model.

The standard diagrammatic perturbation theory would involve the impurity-bath Greens function [formula] as propagators with four point vertex U and two-point vertex μ. (As discussed shortly the inclusion of μ in the interaction rather than the propagator is in principle a matter of convenience.) We will not do perturbation theory but nevertheless use G0 (rather than Δ) to describe the impurity. Assuming Δ is particle-hole symmetric and with a clean gap we can write

[formula]

with a0 = (1 - dωΔ|ω = 0)- 1. Here g0 is gapped such that Img0(ω + i0+) = 0 for |ω| < εgap and has integrated weight [formula].

The choice of including the chemical potential in the interaction rather than in the non-interacting Greens function (G'0 = 1 / (z + μ  -  Δ)) is convenient (and standard for this problem) because it makes G0 particle-hole symmetric. Within the present approximation the convention is also valuable because it isolates a substantial part of the spectral weight in a single pole at ω = 0 that may be represented exactly by a finite system, and it also separates the pole from the continuum with a gap of finite width.

As was suggested in Ref. [\cite=Dist-ED] and presently specialized to the gapped Anderson model we propose to make an approximate calculation of the self energy in the following way: 1) Generate a large number N of finite-size Anderson models (see Fig. [\ref=example]) indexed by ν = 1,...,N with ns orbitals (ns odd) that correspond to a finite impurity-bath Greens function

[formula]

For i < ns / 2 the pole locations bνi are picked using g0 as a probability distribution function, such that

[formula]

and aνi is a random positive number. Particle-hole symmetry is enforced by taking bνi =  - bνns - i and aνi = aνns - i for i > ns / 2, and normalization by taking [formula]. The construction ensures that

[formula]

2) Identify parameters of the Anderson Hamiltonian

[formula]

where [formula] is the number operator at the bath site i > 0 or impurity site i = 0 with spin [formula] and ni is summed over spin. Hopping between impurity and bath site i is given by Vνi and the bath level energy by ενi. The non-interacting part of the hamiltonian corresponds to the equivalent form of the Greens function

[formula]

which allows for an exact mapping of parameters {aνi,bνi}  →  {Vνi,ενi}, through the location Gν0(ω)|ω  =  εi = 0 and derivative Vνi = ( - dωGν0|εi)- 1 / 2 of roots on the real axis. 3) Calculate, using exact diagonalization, the interacting Greens function Gν and the corresponding self energy

[formula]

To be very confident of the accuracy we have calculated Gν as an explicit sum over all poles that correspond to single particle excitations from the ground states,

[formula]

A block diagonal form in particle number n, spin S and Sz in which the degenerate ground states are known to be in sectors n = ns, S = 1 / 2 and [formula] is used. The self energy Σν(ω) is then calculated by inverting the Greens function away from the real axis at ω + iη. The latter with the exception of the pole at ω = 0 that we calculate explicitly as [formula]. (Removing numerically the corresponding contribution in the inverted Greens function.) At this point the self-energy can also be readily evaluated at any point z away from the real axis for comparison with QMC results on Matsubara frequencies. 4) Calculate the self energy as

[formula]

with the pole at ω = 0 given explicitly by [formula]. As emphasized in Ref. [\cite=Dist-ED] it is not appropriate to calculate the self energy as Σ' - μ  =  〈Gν0〉- 1  -  〈Gν〉- 1, because the mean of the Greens functions do not satisfy a Dyson equation. The latter implies that roots of G0 are also roots of G which will not be satisfied for the means.

The calculation of the self energy is the crux of the DMFT iteration, where Σ(ω) is then used to calculate a new impurity-bath Green's function G0(ω). The pole strength at ω = 0 is given exactly by [formula], making it convenient (but not crucial for the results) to keep track of this explicitly. Importantly, the broadening η is built into the cycle, as the starting point of the next iteration is based on an assumed real frequency Greens function which is actually calculated from a self energy evaluated a finite distance from the real axis. Thus, even if at each iteration the dependence on η may be quite weak, the difference will be iteratively enhanced such that the self consistent solutions for small and large η turn out radically different.

Results and discussion

We have done calculations using ns  =  3,5, and 7 for U ranging from close to Uc1  ≈  2.5 to very large, and η ranging from 0.1 down to 10- 5. We have focused primarily on U = 4, well into the insulating region of the phase diagram, using ns  =  5 and η = 0.001 which are the results discussed and shown in the figures unless stated otherwise. Calculations have been done on a compute cluster using up to 300 kernels, sampling up to N = 107 5-level systems which corresponds to a self energy built up of 109 poles. This large number of stochastically distributed poles allows for η as small as 10- 4 without significant noise. We have used a discretization Δω = 0.001, but since the mapping Σ(ω)  ⇔  G0(ω) is point for point this does not introduce any additional approximation (unless there is structure on an even smaller scale) even if η  <  Δω. The only consequence is that in the latter case we need to have a very large number of samples N in order to capture the proper N  →    ∞   value of Σ. To initialize the calculations we use an arbitrary insulating self energy such as the expression for an isolated site, Σ(z)  ~  1 / z.

The main result of these calculations (Fig. [\ref=delta001_delta01]) that the self consistent solutions for the self energy and corresponding spectral function has a narrow peak structure at the inner edge of the Hubbard bands. The peak corresponds to an actual narrow band of coherent quasiparticles solving ω  -  ε  +  μ - ReΣ(ω) = 0 for a range of ω values and that are clearly distinguished from the incoherent weight contributing to the main part of the Hubbard bands. At U = 4 we find a quasiparticle weight [formula]. The quasiparticle weight does not appear to be strongly U dependent, instead the quasiparticles are defined over a decreasing fraction of the bare band width with increasing U leading to a gradual disappearance of the peak. Eventually, for large U, there is no quasiparticle solution, but only a remnant peak. There is also weaker more strongly damped (non-quasiparticle) secondary peaks that follow from the coupled oscillations of G(ω) and Σ(ω) built into the DMFT solution.

A surprising property of the calculations is that solutions are very sensitive to the pole broadening η, with solutions converged at η = 0.1 have a featureless self energy and spectral weight with no evidence of the quasiparticles that are found at smaller η. Operationally we find that this qualitative difference comes form the fact that the self energy and local Greens function are coupled self consistently which may enhance slight differences. As exemplified in Figure [\ref=DMFT_iteration], starting a calculation with η = 0.001 from a converged solution at η = 0.1 there is at each DMFT iteration only a slight enhancement at the inner edge of band but that eventually develops into the full quasiparticle peak.

Comparing to D-DMRG results by Karski et al.[\cite=Karski_DMRG] we find that the large η featureless solutions are in good, semi-quantitative, agreement. The lack of quantitative agreement may be due to the additional step of analytic continuation from finite η to real frequency for the D-DMRG results. In contrast, as discussed before, other D-DMRG results by Nishimoto et al. do find a peak structure close to Uc1.

At a more basic level we find that we can identify an energy scale that must be resolved in order to find the quasiparticle solution. The quasiparticles that give a peak in A(ω) are caused by a sharp oscillation in the ReΣ which by analyticity precedes (in |ω|) a peak in ImΣ. This implies that the self-consistent solution must have an offset [formula] between the two peaks (see inset of Fig. [\ref=e_scale]). This is exactly the outcome of the calculation of the self energy, there is a small U-dependent offset [formula] between the inner edge of spectral weight (the spectral gap) and the onset of scattering. We observe from solving finite systems, that there is such an offset, poles in Σν (identified as zeroes in Gν) are always at higher energies than multiples of the bare pole locations of Gν0, an effect which seems genuinely non-perturbative. (In perturbation theory we would expect poles in Σν at integer multiples of the poles in the bare greens function Gν0.) The crux of the matter is of course whether this offset survives the limit ns  →    ∞  . As shown in Figure [\ref=e_scale] the energy scale is diminished with ns, although at the smallest U studied we actually find very little difference between ns  =  3, 5, and 7.

To put this in context, for the metallic solution (not studied here) there is an energy scale related to the width of the central peak in A(ω) which is actually the Kondo scale, TK, of the Anderson impurity.[\cite=NRG] [\cite=George_review] The energy scale identified here for the insulator is also related to the width of a (gapped) quasiparticle peak but whether the two energy scales are related in some way remains to be explored. For the metal, TK vanishes at the metal-insulator transition Uc  ≈  3, whereas the energy scale [formula] appears to vanish only asymptotically for large U.

Quantum Monte Carlo calculations for quantum impurities are in principle numerically exact in the limit of large simulation time.[\cite=QMC] [\cite=CTQMC] Nevertheless, there is at least two major drawbacks of the method which for the Mott insulator studied here makes the method less relevant. First, it works at finite temperature β- 1 = kBT > 0, such that when the gap scale is small there will be appreciable deviations from the T = 0 results.

Secondly, and more dramatic, because it is an imaginary time formalism it gives information about the Greens function or self energy on corresponding imaginary (Matsubara) frequencies [formula]. To get real frequency information requires an analytic continuation, but with statistical noise for finite simulation times it is not feasible to study structure at high energies on the fine scale discussed in this paper. Nevertheless, a direct comparison on the Matsubara frequencies of the Dist-ED results (available for any complex frequency) should provide a useful and rigorous test. We have used the TRIQS code [\cite=triqs] and the hybridization expansion routine within continuous time quantum Monte Carlo (CT-QMC).[\cite=CTQMC] Within the limits set by reasonably achievable noise levels, [formula], of the CT-QMC we find that the Dist-ED results are in very good agreement with the QMC for all parameter values, which is remarkable given how different the solutions appear over real frequencies (Fig. [\ref=delta01_DMRG]). Only for the large η = 0.1 solution (featureless on the real axis) does there appear to be a statistically relevant deviation from the QMC data, which may be related to the slightly wider tails of the spectra in this case. Clearly, the gap edge quasiparticles are consistent with QMC on the imaginary axis, but the latter is too insensitive to the details of real frequency structure to provide a very stringent test.

To conclude, we have found evidence that the Mott insulting state of the Hubbard model in infinite dimensions with a semicircular density of states has well defined gapped electronic quasiparticles even in the paramagnetic phase. We have used the method of distributional exact diagonalization[\cite=Dist-ED] in which the impurity self energy of the DMFT impurity model is calculating as a sample average of the exact self energy of a representative distribution of impurities models with ns levels. Our results suggest that it is crucial to have a very good resolution at each iteration of the DMFT cycle to resolve a small non-perturbatively generated energy scale. We speculate that the quantitative details of the results presented here will depend on the system size ns, and our results for ns = 5 may exaggerate the peak structure, but that the qualitative features are genuine. This is supported by comparison to quantum Monte Carlo results, the lack of any evident signature of finite size structure in our calculations, as well as the earlier findings of a similar peak feature in an independent study.[\cite=Nishimoto] Nevertheless, it is desirable to study larger system sizes within the present method to do a systematic finite size analysis. We hope that our results will also motivate the development of methods that can achieve similarly high resolution at high energies to investigate this issue further.

Appendix: Perturbative motivation at large U

Here we demonstrate that the Dist-ED formalism applied to the Mott insulator may be motivated as a perturbation expansion in the small parameter b0 = 1 - a0, where a0 is the weight of the ω = 0 pole of the impurity-bath Greens function. To 0'th and 1'st order in b0, the method is exact to all orders in the standard perturbation expansion in U.

Consider an arbitrary n'th order diagram in the expansion of the self-energy that contains k = 2n - 1 legs given by [formula], where the calculation consists of evaluating Matsubara sums of products of G0(iωn) (or correspondingly real or imaginary frequency integrals.) Suppressing summations we can write a diagram schematically as Un(G0)k = Un(a0 + b0)k and expand in powers of b0 (keeping in mind the underlying structure of summations that implies that the factors are not equivalent). We now want to study what approximation is made by calculating Σ as the sample average [formula] where Σν is the exact self energy of the finite size impurity problem. For simplicity we will consider the minimal 3-level system with impurity-bath Green's function [formula], where the pole locations bν are distributed according to [formula] such that [formula].

The (a0)k(b0)0 term of the expansion corresponds to evaluating all the Green's function in terms of the z = 0 pole contribution. In the large U limit a0  →  1 and b  →  0 this corresponds to the Hubbard I approximation of an isolated site which is exact in this limit and which is obviously exactly represented by a finite system. To next order (a0)k - 1(b0)1 we will use the second order diagram [formula] ([formula]) for demonstration purpose but the proof would be analogous for an arbitrary self energy diagram. Thus evaluating terms proportional to (a0)2b0 we find

where we have used the fact that bν are distributed according to - Img0, which (using particle-hole symmetry) implies [formula]. The demonstrated calculation clearly holds for any diagram implying that the Dist-Ed formalism is exact to 1'st order in b0. Nevertheless, for large U the self energy has pole strength α  ~  U2,[\cite=strong_coupling] giving b0  ~  1 / U2, such that regarded as expansion in 1 / U the formalism is in fact only exact to order 1 / U2, with higher order terms to all orders included systematically but approximately through the sample averaged exact diagonalization.

Going beyond first order, to order (b0)2, the representation in terms of finite systems will not be exact. It is clear, as expected, that larger finite systems will give better approximations. In fact, for a flat distribution (Img0(ω) = const. in some interval) we expect that a representation in terms of five (or more) level systems will be exact even to order (b0)2 because the calculation will give an unbiased sampling of two energies in the support of g0. The details of this however remain to be studied in greater depth.

The separation of the impurity-bath Greens function G0 in a pole at ω = 0 with a large fraction of the spectral weight and a gapped continuum is special to the insulator and not valid for the metallic solution. It is thus less clear-cut how to best sample the continuous Greens function in terms of finite systems. Although the Dist-ED method has been used successfully also for the metallic problem[\cite=Dist-ED] the original work used a rather ad-hoc method of discarding samples that overrepresented the low-energy spectral weight. How to best formulate the method for problems with continuous low-energy weight is still under investigation.
