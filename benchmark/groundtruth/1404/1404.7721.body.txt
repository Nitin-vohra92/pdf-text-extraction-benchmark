A characterization of BMOα-martingale spaces by fractional Carleson measures

Introduction

In Harmonic Analysis, the space of functions of bounded mean oscillation, or BMO-space, naturally arises as the class of functions whose deviation from their means over cubes is bounded. We recall that a locally integrable function f on [formula] is in [formula]-space if [formula] where [formula] is the Lebesgue measure of the cube Q in [formula], fQ denotes the average(or mean value) of f on Q, and the supremum is taken over all cubes Q in [formula]. It is a good substitution of the L∞ space, as a dual space of Hardy space H1, also in the interpolation theory. Also, Carleson measures are among the most important tools in Harmonic Analysis. A positive measure μ on [formula] is called a Carleson measure if [formula], where l(Q) denotes the side length of the cube Q. Fefferman and Stein found that the BMO-space has a natural and deep relationship with Carleson measures, see [\cite=Fefferman] [\cite=Grafakos]. In [\cite=Wu], the authors studied the relationship between the function in Morry space and a general kind Carleson measure. This general kind Carleson measure is defined as follows. For 0 < p < 1, a positive measure μ on [formula] is called a bounded p-Carleson measure if [formula]. In this paper we will study an analogue characterization in martingale spaces.

Let (Ω,F,P) be a complete probability space. For 1  ≤  p <   ∞   the usual Lp-space of strong p-integrable scalar-valued functions on (Ω,F,P) will be denoted by Lp(Ω) or simply by Lp. Let [formula] be an increasing sequence of sub-σ-fields of F such that [formula] We call a sequence [formula] in L1 to be a martingale if [formula] for every n  ≥  0. Let dnf = fn - fn - 1 with the convention that f-1 = 0. [formula] is the martingale difference sequence of f. To avoid unnecessary convergence problem on infinite series we will assume that all martingales considered in the sequel are finite, unless explicitly stated otherwise. We will adopt the convention that a martingale [formula] will be identified with its final value f∞ whenever the latter exists. And, if f∈L1 we will denote again by f the associated martingale [formula] with [formula] We refer the reader to [\cite=Liu] [\cite=Long] [\cite=Weisz] for more information on martingale theory.

The main object of this paper is the BMOα-martingale space given in the following.

Let 0  ≤  α  ≤  1, [formula] be an increasing sequence of σ-algebras in a probability space (Ω,F,P), [formula] an L2-martingale relative to [formula]. We say that f belongs to BMOα, if The norm in the space BMOα is [formula]

Note that BMO0-martingale space is just the BMO-martingale space.

In fact, if we replace the condition in Definition [\ref=def_of_BMO_alpha] by for any 1  ≤  p  <    ∞   and martingales f∈Lp-martingale space, the space is equivalent with the space defined in Definition [\ref=def_of_BMO_alpha].

Also, we can use another definition of BMOα-space which is equivalent with Definition [\ref=def_of_BMO_alpha], and we can find it in [\cite=Liu] [\cite=Long] as in the following.

Let I(n) be the set of all Fn-atoms, n  ≥  0. Denote where the sum is taken over all I(n)∈I(n).

Let 0  ≤  α  ≤  1, [formula] be an increasing sequence of σ-algebras in a probability space (Ω,F,P), [formula] an L2-martingale relative to [formula]. We say that f belongs to BMOα, if The norm in the space BMOα-martingale space is [formula]

The classical notion of the general Carleson measure in Harmonic Analysis has the following martingale analogue.

Let μ be a nonnegative measure on [formula], where [formula] is equipped with the counting measure dm. μ is called a bounded α-Carleson measure(0  ≤  α < 1) if

[formula]

where the supremum runs over all stopping times τ and τ̂ denotes the "tent" over τ:

[formula]

When α = 0, the α-Carleson measure is just the Carleson measure in martingale theory. In [\cite=Jiao], the author studied the relationship between the Carleson measure and vector-valued BMO-martingale space. And for the scalar-valued case, see [\cite=Long]. In this paper, we will characterize martingales in BMOα-martingale space in terms of α-Carleson measures. In fact, we have the following.

The following statements are equivalent:

f∈BMOα;

the measure [formula] is a bounded α-Carleson measure, i.e.

Related with Carleson measures, there is a famous Carleson's inequality in Harmonic Analysis which was first proved by Carleson.

For any Carleson measure μ and every μ-measurable function f on [formula] we have for all 0 < p <   ∞  , where [formula].

We can get a Carleson's inequality related with BMOα-martingales. Unlike the inequality related with BMO-martingales, we can get it only for 1 < p <   ∞  .

Let [formula] with μk's being nonnegative random variables, be a bounded α-Carleson measure(0 < α < 1), and 1 < p <   ∞  . Then for all adapted processes f = (fn)n  ≥  0, we have

[formula]

where Mf is the maximal function of f = (fn)n  ≥  0. Conversely, if the above inequality, [\eqref=carleson_ine], holds for some 1 < p <   ∞  , with [formula] replaced by a constant Cp, then μ is a bounded α-Carleson measure and [formula]

The paper is organized as follows. In Section [\ref=Section:Extension], we give the proofs of Theorem [\ref=Thm:carleson_chara] and [\ref=Thm:carleson_inequality]. In Section [\ref=Section:App], we get the boundedness of the uniformly bounded martingale transform operator, the square function and the maximal operator on BMOα-martingale spaces easily by using Theorem [\ref=Thm:carleson_chara].

Throughout this paper, the letter C will denote a positive constant which may change from one instance to another.

Proofs of the main theorems

In this section, we will give the proof of Theorem [\ref=Thm:carleson_chara]. In order to do this, we need the following lemma.

Let [formula] be an L2-martingale. Then where the supremum is taken over all stopping times τ.

Assume that [formula] and τ is any stopping time. Then

[formula]

Conversely, let [formula]. For any n  ≥  1 and A∈Fn, define Then,

[formula]

This proves that [formula] We complete the proof of the lemma.

With Lemma [\ref=Lem:BMO_a_L2] above, we can give the proof of Theorem [\ref=Thm:carleson_chara] as follows.

(I)  ⇒  (II). Assume that f∈BMOα. For any 1  ≤  n  ≤  m and A∈Fn, we have

[formula]

This means We define Then, since Ω∈Fτ always, we get

[formula]

By taking supremum over all stopping times, we know that the measure [formula] is a bounded α-Carleson measure.

(II)  ⇒  (I). Let us consider the new σ-fields [formula] and the corresponding martingale [formula] generated by f - fτ. Then by Doob's stopping time theorem,

[formula]

By Burkholder-Gundy's inequality, we get

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

Hence, by Lemma [\ref=Lem:BMO_a_L2] and ([\ref=est_inte_f_tau]) we obtain

[formula]

By the proof above, we know that [formula].

In the following, we will give the proof of Theorem [\ref=Thm:carleson_inequality].

First, assume that μ is a bounded α-Carleson measure, f = (fn)n  ≥  0 is adapted. For any λ > 0, define the stopping time τ  =   inf {n:|fn| > λ}. Then we have Hence,

[formula]

Thus we proved the inequality [\eqref=carleson_ine]. Reversely, we assume that [\eqref=carleson_ine] holds for some 1 < p <   ∞   with a constant Cp. For any stopping time τ, let fn(ω) = χ{τ  ≤  n}(ω), for any ω∈Ω, n  ≥  0. Then Mf(ω) = χ{τ  <    ∞  }(ω), and

[formula]

This means that [formula]. We complete the proof.

In particular, if [formula] with f = (fn)n  ≥  0 is a martingale, then, combined with Theorem [\ref=Thm:carleson_chara], we have that f∈BMOα, if and only if

[formula]

for all adapted f = (fn)n  ≥  0 and some 1 < p <   ∞  .

Applications

In this section, we will give some applications of our main theorem. In order to adapt our result to the applications we need the following remark.

Theorem [\ref=Thm:carleson_chara] can also be stated in a Hilbert-valued setting. If f takes value in a Hilbert space [formula] and the absolute values in the statements are replaced by the norm in [formula], then the result holds also.

For more information about the vector-valued martingales, we refer the reader to [\cite=Liu] [\cite=Martinez] [\cite=Torrea] [\cite=MarTorrea].

The boundedness of martingale transform on BMOα-martingale spaces

Let [formula] be a uniformly bounded Fn-predictable sequence. Then the martingale transform given by

[formula]

is bounded on BMOα-martingale spaces.

For any f∈BMOα, by Theorem [\ref=Thm:carleson_chara], we have that for any stopping time τ,

[formula]

Since [formula] is uniformly bounded, then for any stopping time τ,

[formula]

Then by Theorem [\ref=Thm:carleson_chara], we get Tf∈BMOα and [formula].

The boundedness of square function on BMOα-martingale spaces

The square function [formula] is bounded on BMOα-martingale spaces.

Let us consider the [formula]-valued martingale transform:

[formula]

with [formula] for any k  ≥  1. It maps a [formula]-valued martingale into an [formula]-valued martingale. So, for any f∈BMOα, by Theorem [\ref=Thm:carleson_chara],

[formula]

Therefore, by Remark [\ref=Remark:vector_charac], we have [formula] and [formula] Since, for any n  ≥  1,

[formula]

we have, for any A∈Fn,

[formula]

Whence, [formula].

The boundedness of maximal function on BMOα-martingale spaces

The maximal function [formula] is bounded on BMOα-martingale spaces.

The proof of Theorem [\ref=Thm:maximal] is similar to the proof of the boundedness of maximal function on BMO-martingale spaces with small variations as in [\cite=Long].

UMD Banach lattice

In [\cite=Burkholder_1981], Burkholder considered the UMD spaces as in the following.

A Banach space [formula] is said to be a UMD space if for all [formula]-valued martingales [formula] and all sequences [formula] with εn  =    ±  1,

[formula]

where 1 < p <   ∞   and the constant Cp > 0 is independent of k.

It is known that the existence of one p0 satisfying the inequality is enough to assure the existence of the rest of p, 1 < p <   ∞  . In this section, we concentrate on the Banach lattice. Let [formula] be a Banach lattice. Without loss of generality we assume that [formula] is a Banach lattice of measurable functions on measure space (Ω,dP). We refer the reader to [\cite=LindenTza] for more information on Banach lattices.

The following lemma is well known; see [\cite=Bourgain] [\cite=Rubio_de_F].

Let [formula] be a Banach lattice. The following statements are equivalent:

[formula] is a UMD space;

there exist 1 < p <   ∞   and a constant C > 0 such that

[formula]

for any [formula]-valued martingale f, where [formula].

By Theorem 3.4 in [\cite=Jiao] and our characterization theorem of BMOα-martingales in Theorem [\ref=Thm:carleson_chara], we can get a characterization of UMD Banach lattice in the following theorem.

Let [formula] be a Banach lattice. The following statements are equivalent:

[formula] is a UMD space;

there exists a constant C > 0 such that

[formula]

for any [formula]-valued martingale f.

(I)  ⇒  (II). For any stopping time τ, we consider the new [formula]-valued martingale   =  ω-  ατ(f - fτ) with respect to σ-fields [formula] Since [formula] is a UMD space, [formula] by Lemma [\ref=Lem:UMD_square]. Then

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

Conversely,

[formula]

And, since [formula], we have

[formula]

So

[formula]

Combining ([\ref=equ_UMD1]) and ([\ref=equ_UMD2]), we get

[formula]

Hence, by Lemma [\ref=Lem:BMO_a_L2], we obtain the desired inequalities.

(II)  ⇒  (I).
