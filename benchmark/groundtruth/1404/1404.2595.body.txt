The peculiar extinction law of SN2014J measured with The Hubble Space Telescope

Introduction

The study of the cosmological expansion history using Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), of which SN 2014J is the closest in several decades [\citep=2014ApJ...784L..12G] has revolutionized our picture of the Universe. The discovery of the accelerating Universe [\citep=1998AJ....116.1009R] [\citep=1999ApJ...517..565P] has lead to one of the biggest scientific challenges of our time: probing the nature of dark energy through more accurate measurements of cosmological distances and the growth of structure in the universe. SNe Ia remain among the best tools to measure distances and as the sample grows both in numbers and redshift range, special attention is required in addressing systematic effects. One important source of uncertainty is the effect of dimming by dust. In spite of considerable effort, it remains unclear why the color-brightness relation for SNe Ia from cosmological fits is significantly different from e.g. dimming by interstellar dust with an average [formula]. In the most recent compilation by [\citet=2014arXiv1401.4064B], 740 low and high-z SNe Ia were used to build a Hubble diagram using the SALT2 lightcurve fitter [\citep=2007AA...466...11G]. Their analysis yields β = 3.101  ±  0.075, which corresponds to [formula], although the assumed color law in SALT2 differs from the standard Milky-Way type extinction law [\citep=1989ApJ...345..245C].

Several cases of [formula] has been found in studies of color excesses of local, well-measured, SNe Ia [\citep=2006AJ....131.1639K] [\citep=2006MNRAS.369.1880E] [\citep=2008MNRAS.384..107E] [\citep=2008A&A...487...19N] [\citep=2010AJ....139..120F]. A low value of [formula] corresponds to steeper wavelength dependence of the extinction, especially for shorter wavelengths. In general terms, this reflects the distribution of dust grain sizes where a low [formula] implies that the light encounters mainly small dust grains. [\citet=2005ApJ...635L..33W] and [\citet=2008ApJ...686L.103G] suggest an alternative explanation that non-standard reddening of SNe Ia could originate from multiple scattering of light, e.g., due to a dusty circumstellar medium, a scenario that has been inferred for a few SNe Ia [\citep=2007Sci...317..924P] [\citep=2009ApJ...693..207B] [\citep=2012Sci...337..942D].

A tell-tale signature of reddening through multiple scattering is a power-law dependence for reddening [\citep=2008ApJ...686L.103G], possibly also accompanied by a perturbation of the lightcurve shapes [\citep=2011ApJ...735...20A] and IR emission from heated dust regions [\citep=2013MNRAS.431L..43J].

SN 2014J in the nearby galaxy M 82 offers a unique opportunity to study the reddening of a spectroscopically normal (G14; Marion et al. in prep., 2014) SN Ia, over an unusually wide wavelength range. Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations allow us to perform a unique study of color excess in the optical and near-UV, where the difference between the extinction models is the largest. Our data-set is complemented by U observations from the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) and J from the Mount Abu Observatory.

Observations and data

HST/WFC3

We obtained observations (Program DD-13621; PI Goobar) of SN 2014J with HST in the four UV broadband filters F218W, F225W, F275W and F336W for seven epochs using a total of 7 HST orbits during Cycle 21. In addition to this we also obtained optical broad, medium and narrow band photometry in filters F467M, F631N and F845M for visits (1,3) and optical broad-band photometry using F438W, F555W and F814W for the remaining five visits. All observations were obtained with the Wide-Field Camera-3 (WFC3) using the UVIS aperture UVIS2-C512C-SUB.

The data were reduced using the standard reduction pipeline and calibrated through CALWF3 as integrated into the HST archive. The flat-fielded images were corrected for charge transfer inefficiencies at the pixel level and photometry was carried out on the individual images following the guideline from the WFC3 Data Handbook. The individual flat-fielded images were multiplied with the correcting pixel area map following Sec. 7 of the WFC3 Data Handbook. The SN flux could be measured on all images using an aperture with radius 0.2  ''. Host contamination is negligible at the SN position and the statistical uncertainties were estimated assuming Poisson noise of the signal together with the readout noise. The resulting photometry is presented in Tab. [\ref=tb:phot].

Optical and near-IR data

The U data were obtained with the NOT (Program 48-004; PI Amanullah). The data were reduced with standard IRAF routines, using the QUBA pipeline [\citep=2011MNRAS.416.3138V]. The magnitudes are measured with a PSF-fitting technique (using daophot) and calibrated to the Landolt system.

NIR observations in the Mauna Kea Observatory J filters were carried out with the Mount Abu 1.2 m Infrared telescope. Aperture photometry of the sky-subtracted frames was done using IRAF. The nearby star 2MASS J09553494+6938552, which registers simultaneously with SN 2014J in the same field, was used for calibration. Results were cross-checked with other 2MASS stars in the field and found to agree within 5 %. We adopt this as a systematic uncertainty on the NIR photometry.

All lightcurves are presented in Table 1 and Fig. [\ref=fig:lc] where we also show a fitted model to the V-band using SNooPy [\citep=2011AJ....141...19B].

Color excess

Intrinsic SN Ia colors

In order to study the reddening of SN 2014J, the colors for a pristine, unreddened, SN Ia must be known. Further, we need a color template that includes both the wavelengths and epochs covered by the observations presented in this work.

As described in G14, the early spectral evolution of SN 2014J and SN 2011fe in the nearby spiral galaxy M 101 is remarkably similar. The only difference being that SN 2014J shows overall higher photospheric velocities. SN 2011fe has been observed over a broad wavelength range from the UV [\citep=2012ApJ...753...22B] [\citep=2014MNRAS.439.1959M], through the optical [\citep=2013A&A...554A..27P], to the near-IR [\citep=2012ApJ...754...19M] [\citep=2013ApJ...766...72H]. The similarity to SN 2014J together with the low Galactic and host galaxy reddening, E(  -  )MW  =  0.011  ±  0.002 and E(  -  )host  =  0.014  ±  0.002 mag [\citep=2013A&A...549A..62P], makes SN 2011fe the best template we can derive of the unreddened spectral energy distribution (SED) of SN 2014J.

We use the spectral series from [\citet=2014MNRAS.439.1959M] and [\citet=2013A&A...554A..27P], corrected for Galactic extinction using [\citet=1999PASP..111...63F] with [formula], to compute synthetic colors between in the WFC3 and NOT bands in which SN 2014J was observed. The effective HST filters were obtained from synphot/stsdas, while we used modified versions of the public effective NOT filters. We further use the SN 2011fe lightcurves from [\citet=2012ApJ...754...19M] as an unreddened NIR template of SN 2014J. All lightcurves are shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:lc] (dashed curves) where they have been shifted to overlap with the corresponding SN 2014J photometry at maximum. Smoothed splines are fitted using SNooPy to each individual band to create a pristine lightcurve template.

As seen in Fig. [\ref=fig:lc], the NIR lightcurves of SN 2011fe provide an excellent description of the corresponding bands of SN 2014J, while this is not the case for the bluer bands. At these wavelengths SN 2011fe appears to both rise and fall faster than SN 2014J, and the difference between the two objects increases with shorter wavelengths. As will be argued in Sec. [\ref=sec:law] this is partially an effect that stems from the fact that broadband observations of SN 2014J are effectively probing longer wavelengths than the corresponding data of SN 2011fe due to the significant extinction. Taking this effect into account leads to the dotted lines for the reddened SED of SN 2011fe in Fig. [\ref=fig:lc].

The spectral series will also be used in the analysis to calculate the expected extinction in each passband for a given extinction law. The [\citet=2014MNRAS.439.1959M] dataset extend out to [formula]m until phase + 9. Since this does not cover the entire phase-range of our study we extended this spectral series using the template from [\citet=2007ApJ...663.1187H] [\citet=2013ApJ...766...72H] for phases past + 9.

In order to compare SN 2014J with SN 2011fe, we also need an estimate of the uncertainty within which we would expect the broadband colors of two SNe Ia to agree in the absence of extinction. [\citet=2010AJ....139..120F] studied the intrinsic optical and near-IR colors of SNe Ia close to lightcurve maximum, and found dispersions in the range 0.06-0.14 mag, after correcting for lightcurve shape. We conservatively adopt a dispersion of 0.15 mag (the worst case above) for all colors that only include the optical and NIR bands.

Further, [\citet=2010ApJ...721.1627M] presented an extensive study of the UV-  V dispersion based on observations of 12 SNe Ia with the Swift satellite. For their low-extinction (E(  -  ) < 0.2) sample they derive dispersions of 0.1 and 0.25 mag between - 12 and + 12 days relative B-band maximum for the uvw1  -  v and uvw2  -  v colors respectively. We adopt a dispersion of 0.35 mag for the colors that involve F218W and F225W and 0.25 mag for F275W. For the [formula] dispersion we adopt the same value as the optical range, i.e., 0.15 mag. Since UV observations of SNe Ia are scarce it is difficult to fully assess the differences among supernovae at the shortest wavelengths considered here. [\citet=2013ApJ...769L...1F] argued that although SN 2011by was a spectral "twin" to SN 2011fe in the optical, it exhibited a different behavior in the near-UV. We have therefore checked how our estimate of the color excess of SN 2014J would differ under the assumption that it is a better match to SN 2011by instead of SN 2011fe. The offsets at lightcurve maximum are [formula] mag and [formula] mag, i.e., compatible with our estimate of the intrinsic color scatter.

Color excesses of SN 2014J

In this work we study the color excesses, E(V - X), of all photometric bands with respect to the V-band. For each photometric observation in Table [\ref=tb:phot] we also list the corresponding V magnitude. If the SN was observed in both bands within 12 hours we use the observed V for the corresponding epoch, but when this was not the case we use the fitted V-band SNooPy model shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:lc] to calculate the color.

For each epoch we also present the calculated Galactic reddening correction. Unlike G14, we use the Galactic extinction towards M 82 from [\citet=2009ApJS..183...67D]. They argue that the estimates from the dust maps of [\citet=1998ApJ...500..525S] are contaminated by M 82 itself, and derived E(B - V)MW = 0.06 from the study of neighboring patches.

We also calculate the corresponding color of SN 2011fe, shown in the last column of Table [\ref=tb:phot], from the lightcurves described above. The color excess, [formula], between the V-band and some other band X, at an epoch n, can then be obtained under the assumption that the two SNe had nearly identical color evolution. Since the differences in K-corrections are negligible for the two very nearby SNe, the color excess is calculated as the difference between the [formula] color, corrected for Galactic extinction, and the corresponding color of SN 2011fe, i.e.

[formula]

The first term on the right hand side, the extinction corrected color of SN 2014J, is plotted in Fig. [\ref=fig:color] together with the best fit colors derived from the reddened SED, as described in the next section. In Fig. [\ref=fig:extinctionlaw], [formula] is plotted using data around maximum light.

Fitting extinction laws

An extinction law, ξ(λ;), where [formula] are free parameters, can be fitted by minimizing

[formula]

Here [formula] is the measured color excess as described above and AVn  -  AXn, the corresponding model color excess,

[formula]

can be calculated from the filter transmission, TX(λ), and the SED of SN 2011fe, [formula], of the given epoch n.

The uncertainties, σ2VnXn, include the measurement errors shown in Table [\ref=tb:phot] but is dominated by the adopted intrinsic SN Ia color uncertainties. If a V-band measurement is included in constructing two different colors for a given epoch, then the contribution from the V uncertainty is treated as fully correlated.

In this work we ignore both calibration uncertainties (except for NIR) and systematic errors due to e.g. Galactic extinction correction. The reason being that these will be correlated between epochs and are negligible in comparison to the intrinsic color uncertainty, that we also assume to be fully correlated. This will put equal weights to all colors, independently of the number of data points obtained in each band.

We further assume that the different colors are uncorrelated in our final analysis. We have tried inducing different correlations between the colors, but this had a minor impact on the conclusions from the fits.

We have fitted three different extinction laws: a MW-like extinction law as parametrized by [\citet=1999PASP..111...63F], the SALT2 law in the version used in [\citet=2014arXiv1401.4064B], and a power-law parametrization, Aλ / Av  =  (λ  /  λV)p, shown to be a good approximation for multiple scattering scenarios [\citep=2008ApJ...686L.103G]. Each law was fitted using three different epoch ranges:

[formula]

, and the full epoch range of the HST observations,

[formula]

1.37(0.03) 1.4(0.1) 1.1 1.85(0.11) - 2.1(0.1) 1.1 1.06(0.04) 5.3

[formula]

1.29(0.02) 1.3(0.1) 3.3 1.77(0.10) - 2.1(0.1) 2.3 1.00(0.01) 5.2

Conclusions

We present results from fitting three extinction laws to observations of SN 2014J in 16 photometric bands spanning the wavelength range 0.2-2  μm between phases - 5 and + 35 days with respect to B-maximum. We find a remarkably consistent picture with reddening law fits only involving two free parameters. Once reddening is accounted for, the similarity between the multi-color lightcurves of SN 2014J and SN 2011fe is striking.

We measure an overall steep extinction law with a total-to-selective extinction value [formula] at maximum of [formula] for a MW-like extinction law. We also note that fitted extinction laws are consistent when fitted separately around maximum and using the full phase-range.

Although the fits slightly disfavor the empirically derived SALT2 color law for SN Ia, in comparison to a MW-like extinction law as parametrized by FTZ with a low [formula], conclusions should be drawn cautiously. SALT2 has not been specifically trained for the near-UV region considered here. Also, there is no prediction for the near-IR. Intriguingly, power-law extinction proposed by [\citet=2008ApJ...686L.103G] as a model for multiple scattering of light provides a good description of the reddening of SN 2014J.

Increasing this sample is crucial to understand the possible diversity in reddening of SNe Ia used to measure the expansion history of the Universe.
