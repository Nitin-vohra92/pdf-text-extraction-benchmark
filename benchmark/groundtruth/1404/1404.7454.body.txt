Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund Strong Law of Large Numbers for Pairwise i.i.d. Random Variables

Keywords: strong law of large numbers, pairwise independent random variables, identically distributed random variables.

Let {Xn}∞n = 1 be a sequence of independent identically distributed random variables. There are two famous theorems on the strong law of large numbers for such a sequence: The Kolmogorov theorem and the Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund theorem (see e.g. Loève [\cite=Loeve77]). Let [formula]. By Kolmogorov's theorem, there exists a constant b such that Sn / n  →  b a.s. if and only if E|X1|  <    ∞  ; if the latter condition is satisfied then b  =  EX1.

Now we state the Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund theorem:

The aim of this work is to show that Theorem [\ref=P101] remains true if we replace the independence condition by the condition of pairwise independence of random variables [formula]

Etemadi [\cite=Etem81] proved the Kolmogorov theorem under the pairwise independence assumption instead of the independence condition. Sawyer [\cite=Sawyer66] showed that if 0  <  p  <  1 then the condition E|X1|p  <    ∞   implies Sn / n1 / p  →  0 a.s. without any independence condition. Petrov [\cite=Petr96] proved that if 0  <  p  <  2 then relation [\eqref=e11] (with b = 0 or EX1 according as p  <  1 or [formula]) implies that E|X1|p  <    ∞   assuming pairwise independence.

In the present work we shall prove that if 1  <  p  <  2 then the condition E|X1|p  <    ∞   implies (Sn - ESn) / n1 / p  →  0 a.s. under the pairwise independence assumption. There are a number of papers that contain results on the strong law of large numbers for sequences of pairwise independent identically distributed random variables. See Choi and Sung [\cite=ChoiSung85], Li [\cite=Li88], Martikainen [\cite=Mart95], Sung [\cite=Sung97] [\cite=Sung14] (recent work [\cite=Sung14] contains more detailed review). However, results in these papers do not generalize Theorem [\ref=P101] to sequences of pairwise independent random variables.

The aim of this paper is to prove the following result:

Let {Xn}∞n = 1 be a sequence of pairwise independent identically distributed random variables. If E|X1|p  <    ∞   where 1  <  p  <  2, then

[formula]

If we combine Etemadi's, Sawyer's, and Petrov's results mentioned in the previous section with Theorem [\ref=T1], we get a generalization of the Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund theorem (Theorem [\ref=P101]):

Let {Xn}∞n = 1 be a sequence of pairwise independent identically distributed random variables. If 0  <  p  <  2 then the relation E|X1|p  <    ∞   is equivalent to relation [\eqref=e11].

To prove our main result we need the following lemmas.

Let {Xn}∞n = 1 be a sequence of identically distributed random variables. If E|X1|p  <    ∞   where 1  <  p  <  2, then

[formula]

Let [formula], [formula]. Note that condition E|X1|p  <    ∞   is equivalent to the relation

[formula]

Thus, we have

Therefore, by Borel-Cantelli lemma,

[formula]

Moreover

[formula]

By [\eqref=e204] the right-hand side of [\eqref=e205] converges to zero almost sure and relation [\eqref=e201] follows.

Let {Xn}∞n = 1 be a sequence of identically distributed random variables. If E|X1|p  <    ∞   where 1  <  p  <  2, then

[formula]

Note that for any non-negative random variable ξ and a  >  0,

Hence

[formula]

Using [\eqref=e202], we get

[formula]

From obvious equality

[formula]

it follows that

which, in conjunction with [\eqref=e208] and [\eqref=e209], proves [\eqref=e206].

Let {Xn}∞n = 1 be a sequence of identically distributed random variables. If E|X1|p  <    ∞   where 1  <  p  <  2, then

[formula]

Note that for any non-negative random variable ξ and a  >  0,

Hence, using [\eqref=e210], for some positive constants C and C1, we obtain

[formula]

and [\eqref=e212] follows.

Without loss of generality it can be assumed that EX1 = 0. Let

The application of Lemma [\ref=Lem202] yields to [\eqref=e321].

Now we note that to conclude the proof of the theorem, it is sufficiently to show that

[formula]

Step 3. Let us prove that

[formula]

Using Lemma [\ref=Lem203], by Chebyshev's inequality, for any ε > 0, we obtain

[formula]

Thus, by Borel-Cantelli lemma, we have that relation [\eqref=e324] is proved.

Step 4. Let us prove that

[formula]

Using Lemma [\ref=Lem203], by Chebyshev's inequality, for any ε > 0, we obtain

Step 5. We shall prove that

[formula]

For [formula] and k such that [formula] we have

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

The application of Lemmas [\ref=Lem201] and [\ref=Lem202] and relations [\eqref=e324] and [\eqref=e328] yields to [\eqref=e332].

Step 6. We shall prove that

[formula]

For [formula] and k such that [formula] we have

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

The application of Lemmas [\ref=Lem201] and [\ref=Lem202] and relation [\eqref=e324] yields to [\eqref=e335].

Step 7. We shall prove that

[formula]

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

The application of Lemmas [\ref=Lem201] and [\ref=Lem202] and relations [\eqref=e324], [\eqref=e332] and [\eqref=e335] yields to [\eqref=e338]. Relation [\eqref=e338] implies [\eqref=e323]. Relations [\eqref=e319], [\eqref=e321] and [\eqref=e323] imply [\eqref=e1001]. Theorem [\ref=T1] is proved.
