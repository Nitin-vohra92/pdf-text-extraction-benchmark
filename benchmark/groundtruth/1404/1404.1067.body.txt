Weak extremals in the symmetrized bidisc

Preliminaries

Introduction

Over 15 years ago N. Young and J. Agler in a sequence of papers (see for example [\cite=You] and references contained there) devised a new approach to the spectral Nevanlinna-Pick problem. The crucial role was played by the special domain, the so-called symmetrized bidisc. It is a bounded subdomain of [formula] denoted by [formula] and given by the formula

[formula]

The main idea of Agler and Young was to show that if xj are cyclic, [formula], then the 2  ×  2 spectral Nevanlinna-Pick problem has a solution if and only if there exists a solution to a proper Pick problem in [formula].

There is a natural link between the spectral Nevanlinna-Pick problem and so-called weak m-extremal mappings defined in our previous paper [\cite=Kos-Zwo_2014] (we shall give a definition in the second section), see Remark [\ref=uzupelnic]. In principle, the notion of a weak m-extremal mappings is similar to the notion of an m-extremal mapping introduced in recent papers of J. Agler, Z. Lykova and N. Young. The main difference, beyond a strong connection of weak m-extremal mappings with the SNP problem, lies in the fact that in some sense weak m-extremal mappings always do exist (see Subsection [\ref=weak] for details). This is not the case for m-extremal mappings - a priori we have no guarantee that considered objects exist.

There is a correspondence between weak m-extremals in the symmetrized bidisc and m-extremals classical Cartan domain of the first type (recall here that we have shown in [\cite=Kos-Zwo_2014] that the weak m-extremals and m-extremals coincide in a class of domains containing for example the Cartan domains), i.e. the unit ball in the space of 2  ×  2 complex matrices equipped with the operator norm which we shall denote in the sequel by RI. This turns out to be very useful as the Cartan domain has a very nice geometry - it is balanced, homogenous. In particular, Schur's algorithm may be applied to this domain.

Using this correspondence we shall show in Theorem [\ref=thrational] that weak m-extremal mappings in the symmetrized bidisc are rational and [formula]-inner (for the definition see Subsection [\ref=additional]) extending the result obtained in [\cite=Kos-Zwo_2014]. This result applied to m-extremals solves a conjecture posed in [\cite=Agl-Lyk-You_2013]. Moreover, our method allows us to estimate the degree of weak m-extremals.

Here and throughout the paper [formula] denotes the unit disc in the complex plane. O(D,G) is the space of holomorphic mappings between a domain D and a set G. We shall shortly write O(D) for [formula]. Moreover, O(,G) denotes the space of holomorphic mappings in a neighborhood of [formula] with values in G. For a matrix a let aτ be a matrix obtained after a permutation of columns of a. The transposition of a is denoted by at. ∂sD stands for the Shilov boundary of a bounded domain of [formula]. Finally f*(ζ) is the non-tangential limit (provided that it exists) of a bounded holomorphic function f at a point [formula].

Weak m-extremal mappings

Let D be a domain in [formula]. Take pairwise distinct points [formula] and [formula], m  ≥  2. Following [\cite=Agl-Lyk-You_2013] we say that the interpolation data

[formula]

is extremally solvable if there is an analytic disc h in D such that h(λj) = zj for [formula] and there is no f∈O(,D) such that f(λj) = zj, [formula]

We shall say that an analytic disc [formula] is a weak m-extremal with respect to pairwise distinct points λj in [formula], [formula], if the interpolation data λj  ↦  h(λj) is extremally solvable. Naturally, an analytic disc is called to be a weak m-extremal (or shortly a weak extremal) if it is a weak m-extremal with respect to some pairwise distinct points [formula].

In [\cite=Agl-Lyk-You_2013] the authors introduced a stronger notion of m-extremal mappings: an analytic disc [formula] is called m-extremal (or shortly extremal) if for any pairwise distinct points λj in [formula], [formula], it is a weak m-extremal with respect to λj. As mentioned in [\cite=Kos-Zwo_2014], m-extremals in this sense usually do not exist (for example there are no m-extremals in an annulus in the complex plane). This fact justifies the desire of introducing a weaker definition of m-extremal mappings.

On the other hand weak m-extremals are more natural due to the following self-evident observation: the interpolation data λj  ↦  zj, [formula] is extremally solvable if and only if there is a weak m-extremal h in D with respect to λj such that h(λj) = zj.

SNP problem and weak m-extremals

The following simple result shows that weak m-extremals are naturally connected with the spectral Nevanlinna-Pick problem:

Let [formula] be pairwise distinct points in the unit disc and let [formula] be distinct. Then the following conditions are equivalent:

the Pick problem λj  ↦  (sj,pj) for the symmetrized bidisc is solvable;

there is 0 < t  ≤  1 and a weak m-extremal mapping h with respect to [formula] such that h(tλj) = (sj,pj).

If [formula] solves the problem tλj  ↦  (sj,pj), [formula], for some t  ≤  1, then λ  ↦  f(tλ) solves λj  ↦  (sj,pj), [formula], [formula] so (ii) easily implies (i).

To show that (i) implies (ii) define t as a infimum of all s  ≤  1 such that the problem sλj  ↦  (sj,pj), [formula], has a solution. Clearly t > 0, a standard argument implies that tλj  ↦  (sj,pj), [formula], [formula], is solvable and the fact that it extremally solvable follows immediately from the minimality of t.

Proposition [\ref=propt] remains true for more general domains (for example if [formula] is replaced with a bounded hyperconvex domain). It particular, it holds for the classical Cartan domains.

The symmetrized bidisc may be also given as an image of the classical Cartan domain of the first type [formula] under the mapping

[formula]

(see Lemma [\ref=lem1] for details).

The natural way to study the sprectrall Nevanlinna-Pick problem is to investigate the class of weak m-extremals in the symmetrized bidisc. We do it here showing, in particular, the following result which answers the question posed in [\cite=Agl-Lyk-You_2013]:

Any weak m-extremal in the symmetrized polydisc is rational and [formula]-inner.

Basic ideas and tools

In this section we recall and introduce basic tools that will be used in the sequel. Some ideas are derived from our recent paper [\cite=Kos-Zwo_2014]. We recall them for the convenience of the Reader.

Symmetrized bidisc vs. bidisc

Recall that [formula] may be given as the image of the bidisc [formula] under the mapping

[formula]

Moreover, [formula] is a proper holomorphic mapping and [formula] is its locus set (Σ is sometimes called the royal variety of [formula]). This, in particular, means that

[formula]

is a double branched holomorphic covering.

Thus, any analytic disc in [formula] omitting Σ may be lifted to an analytic disc in [formula]. Therefore, in principle, it is definitely easier to deal with weak m-extremals omitting the royal variety Σ.

The group of automorphims of the symmetrized bidisc is generated by the mappings

[formula]

where m is a Möbius function and

[formula]

where [formula] (see [\cite=Jar-Pfl_2004]).

Recall also that the Shilov boundary of [formula] is equal to [formula].

Symmetrized bidisc vs. classical Cartan domain

Let us define

[formula]

Note that [formula].

Any analytic disc in the symmetrized bidisc may be lifted to an analytic disc in I. This gives the following result which is crucial for our considerations (see [\cite=Agl] and [\cite=Kos-Zwo_2014]):

Let [formula] be an analytic disc. Then there is [formula] such that [formula]. Moreover, either

f is up to an automorphism of [formula] of the form (0,f2), or

φ is an analytic disc in RII.

It is self evident that if [formula] is a weak m-extremal and φ is an analytic disc in RII (respectively in RI) such that [formula], then φ is m-extremal in RII (resp. in RI). Moreover, (0,f2) is m-extremal in the symmetrized bidisc if and only if f2 is a Blaschke product of degree at most m - 1. Therefore, the problem of describing weak m-extremals in the symmetrized bidisc may be reduced to study of m-extremals in the classical Cartan domain of the second type. Here we may apply Schur's algorithm which reduces a problem of investigation of m-extremals to describing 2-extremals i.e. complex geodesics. Formulas for complex geodesics in RII were found in [\cite=Aba]. For the convenience of the Reader we sketch the idea how to get them. Thanks to the transitivity of [formula] it suffices to find formulas for a complex geodesic passing through 0 and an arbitrary point a∈RII. Moreover, up to a composition with a linear automorphism we may assume that [formula], where 0  ≤  a2  ≤  a1 < 1. Then it is clear that any geodesic passing through 0 and a is of the form [formula], where [formula] fixes the origin and Z(a1) = a2. Therefore, Schur's algorithm gives the following:

Let [formula] be an m-extremal. Then there is k  ≤  m - 1, there are [formula] and there is [formula] such that

[formula]

The group of automorphisms of RI is generated by the mappings

[formula]

where b∈RI, and by

[formula]

where U and V are unitary. Note that Φb(0) = b and Φb(b) = 0. It is clear that that any automorphism of RI is a rational mapping.

An automorphism of [formula] of the form [\eqref=autg] induces the automorphism Φa of the form [\eqref=autgg], were a is scalar, and an automorphism [\eqref=autgl] induces the automorphism x  ↦  UxUt, where U = I, [formula].

The Shilov boundary of [formula] may be expressed in terms of the Shilov boundary of RII as well. Recall here that ∂sRII consists of symmetric unitary matrices. Then, one may check that

[formula]

We shall use the facts presented above several times. We shall also need the following simple

Suppose that the mapping φ appearing in Lemma [\ref=lem1] is symmetric and φτ is symmetric too, i.e. [formula]. Then a: = (φ1  +  φ2) and b: = (φ1  -  φ2), are holomorphic selfmappings of [formula] such that p(a,b)  =  φ. In particular, if f is a weak m-extremal than at least one of functions a and b is a Blaschke product of degree at most m - 1.

In [\cite=Kos-Zwo_2014] we have shown that in RI and RII the class of weak m-extremal mappings coincide with the class of m-extremal mappings.

Let [formula] be an analytic disc. Lifting it to I we get an analytic disc ψ such that [formula]. There are Blaschke products (finite or infinite) or unimodular constants B1 and B2 such that ψ12  =  B1h12 and ψ21  =  B2h21, where holomorphic functions h12 and h21 do not vanish on [formula].

Put [formula], where the branch of the square root is arbitrarily chosen. Then [formula] lands in I and [formula].

If additionally ψ lies in RI, then ψ̃ lies in RI too.

It follows from Schur's algorithm that (weak) m-extremals in RI and RII are proper. Using this, Remark [\ref=uzupelnic1] and properness of the mapping [formula] (see e.g. [\cite=Abo-Whi-You_2007] and [\cite=Edi-Kos-Zwo_2013], [\cite=Kos-Zwo_2013] for some information about the geometry of [formula]), where [formula] is the tetrablock and Π(x)  =  (x11,x22, det x), [formula], we get an analogous result for weak m-extremals in the symmetrized bidisc (see also [\cite=Kos-Zwo_2014], Remark 15):

Any weak m-extremal mapping in [formula] is proper. In particular, if [formula] is a weak m-extremal in the symmetrized bidisc such that [formula], where [formula], then |φ*12|  =  |φ*21| almost everywhere on [formula].

Remark [\ref=uzupelnic1] has also the following consequence:

Let [formula] be an analytic disc and let [formula] be such that [formula] and ψ11  =  B1h, ψ22  =  B2h for some Blaschke products (or unimodular constants) B1, B2 and a holomorphic function h. Then [formula] is an analytic disc in II such that [formula] and |ψ̃22|  ≤  |ψ̃11|.

If the problem

[formula]

has a solution, then there is a solution of the form λ  ↦  ψ(tλ), where ψ is a weak m-extremal for tλj and (sj,pj) and 0 < t  ≤  1 is properly chosen. Therefore we believe that study of weak m-extremals is important.

Moreover, thanks to Remark [\ref=uzupelnic2] we may always find a solution φ of [\eqref=finn] such that

[formula]

Other tools and definitions

Since automorphisms of considered domains are rational it is natural to use the notion of a Nash function. Let us recall its definition.

Let Ω be a subdomain of [formula]. We say that a holomorphic function f on Ω is a Nash function if there is a non-zero complex polynomial [formula] such that P(x,f(x)) = 0 for x∈Ω. Similarly, a holomorphic mapping f is called a Nash mapping if its every component is a Nash function. We shall need the following, classical result (see [\cite=Two]):

The set of Nash functions on a domain Ω in [formula] is a subring of the ring of holomorphic functions on Ω.

Finally, let us recall that an analytic disc [formula] is said to be [formula]-inner if [formula], for almost all [formula].

Proof

Let [formula] be a weak m-extremal. If, up to a composition with an automorphism of the symmetrized bidisc, f is of form f = (0,f2), then f2 is a Blaschke product of degree m - 1. Otherwise, by Lemma [\ref=lem1], there is an m extremal ψ in RII such that [formula]. It follows from Lemma [\ref=main] that [formula], [formula], for some k  ≤  m - 1, [formula], and a holomorphic mappings [formula]. Our aim is to show that

Z is a Blaschke product of degree ad most m - 1.

We start the proof of this fact with the following technical result:

Let [formula] Then φ:λ  ↦  p(λ,h(λ)), is not a weak m-extremal in [formula] for any m.

By Rouché's theorem the mappings λ  ↦  λ and λ  ↦  h(λ) have one common zero in [formula]. Therefore, composing φ with an automorphism of the symmetrized bidisc and a Möbius function we may assume that h(λ) = λg(λ), where [formula]. We may additionally assume that g is not a Nash function.

We may write

[formula]

[formula], where [formula] [formula]. Note that [formula] (otherwise [formula], whence [formula]) and therefore the mapping

[formula]

is an m-extremal in RI.

For [formula], let [formula] denote the automorphism of RI given by the formula [\eqref=autgg] with [formula]. Let us compute formula for it

[formula]

x = (xij)∈RI. Note that

[formula]

[formula], x∈RI.

Writing

[formula]

we see that

[formula]

either is m - 1 extremal in RI or it lies in ∂RI. Moreover, the mapping

[formula]

lies in ∂RI, thanks to the relation [\eqref=jedn] and the fact that [formula] lies in ∂RII. Let us consider two cases

1) Assume first that ψ is an analytic disc in RI. Then [formula]. Let Φa denote the automorphism of RI given by [\eqref=autgg] with [formula]. Let us write formula for it:

[formula]

x = (xij)∈RI. Note that

[formula]

where [formula], is m - 1 extremal and

[formula]

lies in the boundary of RI. This, in particular, means that χ2 is a unimodular constant (put λ = 0), say [formula], whence [formula]. Let us denote χ  =  χ3. This gives

[formula]

Therefore, making use of [\eqref=gl0] and [\eqref=gl] we get:

[formula]

This equality provide us with a contradiction (χ is not a Nash function, as g is not).

2) Now assume that ψ is an analytic disc in ∂RI. Since ψ̃ lies in ∂RI as well we easily find that |ψ2| = |ψ3| on [formula]. This means that ψ3  =  ωψ2 for some unimodular ω.

Applying a singular value decomposition theorem we see that there is a unitary matrix U = (uij) and an analytic disc [formula] such that

[formula]

In other words

[formula]

Thus λu221  +  λf(λ)u222  =  ωu211  +  ωf(λ)u212, [formula]. Since f is not Nash we immediately get a contradiction.

Seeking a contradiction suppose the contrary i.e. Z is not a Blaschke product. Take pairwise distinct [formula] in the unit disc such that f is a weak m-extremal with respect to [formula]. Then Z is not m-extremal for data λj  ↦  Z(λj), [formula], therefore there is a holomorphic function [formula] such that Z1(λj) = Z(λj), [formula] Modifying it we may additionally assume that Z1 is not a Nash function.

Define

[formula]

Since [formula] and f coincide for λj, [formula], we find that [formula] is a weak m-extremal in [formula]. In particular, |(φ1)11| = |(φ1)22| on [formula] by Proposition [\ref=prop]. Take a function h non-vanishing on [formula] and Blaschke products or unimodular constants b1, b2 such that (φ1)11  =  b1h and (φ1)22  =  b2h. Let b = b1b2. Note that the mapping

[formula]

maps [formula] into RII (otherwise φ2 would be, up to an automorphism of RII of the form [formula] which contradicts the fact that φ2 is not Nash) and it is m-extremal in RII, as [formula], extending past [formula].

Therefore there is l  ≤  m - 1 and there are [formula] automorphisms of RII and a holomorphic mapping [formula] such that

[formula]

Note that T extends holomorphically past [formula] and that it is not a Nash function.

Properties [\eqref=phi2] and [\eqref=phi2a] are crucial in the sequel. Let us define

[formula]

Directly from [\eqref=phi2] we get

[formula]

and

[formula]

Since T is not Nash we find that ψ22(λ,ν)  =  b(λ)ψ11(λ,ν) and ψ12(λ,ν)  =  ψ21(λ,ν), for [formula].

Thus:

[formula]

for any [formula].

If λ and ν lie in [formula], then the left side of [\eqref=11] lies in the Shilov boundary of RII. Therefore [formula] is a unitary matrix for any [formula]. Thus the following equations are satisfied for [formula]:

[formula]

Fix [formula] and let [formula] denote any square root of b(λ0). It follows from equations [\eqref=e1] and [\eqref=e2] that

[formula]

and

[formula]

for any [formula]. Thus there are Blaschke products or unimodular constants B1 and B2 such that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Putting it to [\eqref=11] we get

[formula]

for [formula]. Clearly the matrix in the left side of [formula] lies in the topological boundary of RII for any [formula], as [formula], so its operator norm is equal to 1. On the other hand for any ν in the unit disc the norm of the matrix in the right side of [\eqref=12] is equal to max (|B1(ν)|,|B2(ν)|). In particular, it is less then 1 if ν lies in [formula] provided that both B1 and B2 are not unimodular constants.

Therefore at least one of Bi is constant. Putting [formula] and [formula] and differentiating the equalities [\eqref=eq11] and [\eqref=eq12] we easily get that the equality b(λ0)α21(λ0,ν)  =  α22(λ0,ν) holds for any [formula]. Therefore we have shown that

[formula]

Note that if αj vanishes identically for some j = 1,2, then ψ11(λ,ν) and ψ12(λ,ν) will not be depended on ν which is impossible. Therefore we easily infer that there is a Blaschke product or unimodular constant [formula] such that b = 2.

Define [formula] [formula]. Note that [formula] is a weak m-extremal in [formula] (it is equal to [formula]). Moreover, for any [formula] the point φ3(λ) does not lie in the Shilov boundary of RI as φ2(λ) does not (this follows from the fact that [formula]) and φ3 is not Nash.

Using properties of φ3 we shall construct an m-extremal mapping in [formula] of the form [formula], where φ is an analytic disc in RI extending past [formula] such that φ and φτ are symmetric, [formula] does not touch the Shilov boundary of [formula], φ is not Nash and

either λ  ↦  π(φ(λ)τ) is a weak m-extremal in [formula] omitting Σ, or

φ is a 2-extremal in RI passing through the origin.

To get such a mapping observe that we may assume that (φ1)11 does not vanish on [formula] (otherwise we may include its zeros to [formula]).

If [formula] is a unimodular constant, we just take φ  =  φ3.

Otherwise, let [formula] be zeros of [formula] counted with the multiplicity.

If l = 1, then we may of course assume that b(λ) = λ, [formula]. Composing φτ3 with automorphism Φa of RI of the form [\eqref=autgg] with a scalar a (recall that such an automorphism induces an automorphism of [formula]) we may assume additionally that (φ1)12(0) = 0. Then we have two possibilities:

[formula] is an analytic disc in RI and then [formula] [formula], satisfies (i), or

[formula] lands in the topological boundary of RI and then φ3 is 2-extremal, so φ  =  φ3 satisfies (ii).

Note that the case when l > 1 may be reduced to these two possibilities as well. Let Φλj denote an automorphisms of RI such that Φλj(0)  =  λj and Φλj(λj) = 0, [formula] Since every Φλj induces an automorphism of [formula] (see [\eqref=11]) we see that applying l-times the procedure described above we will obtain in this way a weak m-extremal in [formula] satisfying (i) or (ii).

Note that the situation (i) is impossible. Actually, otherwise one may lift φ to an m-extremal in the bidisc, call it (a1,a2). Losing no generality we may assume that a1 is a Blaschke product of degree at most m. Then [formula] is relatively compact in [formula], which implies that the equation a1 = a2 has one solution in [formula]; a contradiction.

If (ii) holds then [formula] is of the form

[formula]

is a weak m-extremal in [formula] (actually it is m - l-extremal) such that φ and φτ are symmetric. Simply computations (remember about the symmetry of φτ) lead to a formula [formula], [formula]. Using Lemma [\ref=lembegin] one can derive a contradiction.

Rationality of weak m-extremals is a consequence of Lemma [\ref=ms]. The fact that they are inner follows immediately from the description of the Shilov boundaries of the symmetrized bidisc and the classical Cartan domains.

Note that we are able to estimate the degree of any weak m-extremal in the symmetrized bidisc. To do it more precisely one may repeat the argument used in the proof of Lemma [\ref=ms] and show that for any weak m-extremal f in [formula] there are k  ≤  m - 1, pairwise distinct points [formula] in [formula], automorphisms [formula] of RI and a Blaschke product b of degree m - k such that

[formula]

where [formula] [formula], [formula] Note that it is easier to estimate the degree if m-extremal mappings in [formula].

Observe that estimating the degree of a weak m-extremal in [formula] is simple if it omits the royal variety of [formula]:

Let [formula] be a weak m-extremal in [formula] omitting Σ. Then we may lift it of an m-extremal in [formula], i.e. there is a1 - a Blaschke product of degree at most m - 1 and a function [formula] such that f = p(a1,a2). Note that a2 is a Blaschke product of degree at most m - 1. Otherwise one can find a function [formula] such that b is not Nash. Then p(a1,b) is a weak m-extremal in [formula] intersecting Σ (Rouché's theorem). This gives a contradiction, as we have shown that all weak m-extremals in [formula] intersecting Σ are rational.

Let [formula] be a weak m-extremal mapping. Then f2 is a Blaschke product.

There is an analytic disc in RII such that [formula]. It follows from Lemma [\ref=ms] that det φ(λ) is a unimodular constant for any [formula].

Question. Recall the following question stated in [\cite=Kos-Zwo_2014]: are weak m-extremals in the symmetrized bidisc m-extremals? If the answer is positive, the next question is very natural: are extremals in the symmetrized bidisc complex geodesics? For a definition of a complex geodesic see [\cite=Kos-Zwo_2014]. Note that it follows from the results obtained in the paper that for any m there is k such that a weak m-extremal in [formula] is a k-complex geodesic (see Corollary [\ref=cor] and Remark [\ref=deg]).
