Introduction and main results

The class [formula] of classical (strictly) stable distributions (see [\cite=Zolotarev1986]) is uniquely characterized by the following property: [formula] if and only if for any c1,c2 > 0 there exists c3 > 0 such that

[formula]

where [formula] is obtained from measure [formula] by scaling y = cx (equivalently, μc(( -   ∞  ,y]): = μ(( -   ∞  ,y / c])) and the binary operator "*  " denotes the classical convolution. Similarly, the class [formula] of free (strictly) stable distributions (see [\cite=BPB1999] [\cite=Pata_1995]) is characterized by the scaling property [\eqref=def_stable] with the classical convolution "*  " replaced by the free convolution "[formula]". The similarities end at this stage, and in all other respects these two families of distributions seem to be quite different. For example, the main tool for working with a classical stable distribution is its characteristic function, while free stable distributions are described by their Cauchy transform. Another difference is that classical stable distributions have explicit formulas for the Mellin transform and their densities have explicit series expansions (see Sections 2.4, 2.5 and Theorem 2.6.3 in [\cite=Zolotarev1986]), whereas the density of the free stable distributions enjoys a representation as an inverse function of a rather simple explicit function (Propositions A.1.2-A.1.4 in [\cite=BPB1999]) (a result which does not have an analogue in the case of classical stable distributions).

At the same time, several results in the recent papers by Demni [\cite=D2011] and Haagerup and Möller [\cite=HM2013] have offered glimpses of possible deeper similarities and connections between the [formula] and [formula] distributions. Demni [\cite=D2011] has investigated the appearance of the Kanter random variable both in classical and free stable distributions, while the Mellin transform of the positive free stable distributions which was computed by Haagerup and Möller in [\cite=HM2013] bears close resemblance to the Mellin transform of the classical stable distributions, see [\cite=Zolotarev1986].

Our main goal in this paper is to investigate analytical properties of free stable distributions, and to demonstrate their close connections with the classical stable distributions. First, let us introduce notations and definitions and present a new parameterization of free stable distributions. It is known that (up to a scaling parameter) any strictly stable distribution is uniquely characterized by two parameters α and ρ belonging to the set of admissible parameters

[formula]

The characteristic function of a distribution [formula] is given by

[formula]

Similarly, free stable distributions can be characterized by two parameters α and [formula], belonging to the set

[formula]

A free stable distribution [formula] is characterized by the Voiculescu transform

[formula]

where [formula]. In the above formula and everywhere else in this paper we use the principal branch of the logarithm ln (z) and the power function zα  =   exp (α ln (z)). The Voiculescu transform is connected to the measure να, via the Cauchy transform

[formula]

by requiring Gα,(z) to be the inverse function of z  ↦  1 / z + φα,(1 / z). The parameterization (α,) which is used to define the Voiculescu transform via [\eqref=def_phi_Voiculescu] goes back to the seminal work of Bercovici, Pata and Biane [\cite=BPB1999]. In order to present our formulas in a more compact way and to highlight close connections with the classical stable distributions, we have to introduce a new parameterization for the class of free stable distributions. Instead of using the pair (α,)∈B we will use parameters

[formula]

Note that the map (α,)  ↦  (α,ρ) is a bijection between the set B and the set of admissible parameters A. Using this new parameterization (α,ρ)∈A we see that the Voiculescu transform of a distribution [formula] is given by a single expression

[formula]

whereas the original parameterization [\eqref=def_phi_Voiculescu] requires different formulas for α∈(0,1) and α∈(1,2].

For (α,ρ)∈A we will denote by Xα,ρ (Yα,ρ) an [formula]-valued random variable having distribution [formula] (respectively, [formula]).

Now we are ready to present our results, and the proofs are provided in the next section.

Assume that (α,ρ)∈A. Then for s∈( - 1,α)

[formula]

The expression for the Mellin transform of Xα,ρ in [\eqref=eq_Mellin_1] is remarkably similar to the corresponding result for the classical stable distributions (see [\cite=Zolotarev1986]):

[formula]

Taking the limit s  →  0 in [\eqref=eq_Mellin_1] we obtain the following

Assume that (α,ρ)∈A. Then [formula].

The above result clearly demonstrates the benefit of our new parameterization for the free stable distributions: The parameter ρ (unlike [formula]) has a very natural interpretation as the positivity parameter [formula], which is consistent with its definition for the classical stable random variables Yα,ρ.

As we will see later, Theorem [\ref=thm_Mellin] implies that the free stable distribution να,ρ is absolutely continuous, with a smooth density ψα,ρ(x) (a fact that was first established in [\cite=BPB1999]). The following duality result was first established in [\cite=BPB1999], and in this paper we give a new derivation of this result as a simple corollary of Theorem [\ref=thm_Mellin]. We would like to emphasize that the same duality relation also holds for the densities of classical stable distributions.

Assume that [formula] and (α,ρ)∈A. Then for x > 0

[formula]

The above duality law can also be written in terms of random variables. If ξ is a random variable such that [formula], we will denote by [formula] the cutoff of ξ, which is a positive random variable with distribution given by

[formula]

for all Borel sets A  ⊆  (0,  ∞  ). It is easy to see from [formula] that the identity [\eqref=duality_identity1] is equivalent to

[formula]

Theorem [\ref=thm_Mellin] also gives the following distributional identity between stable and free stable distributions.

Let Z be a Gamma(2) random variable (that is, a positive random variable with the density pZ(x) = xe- x, x > 0). For (α,ρ)∈A we have

[formula]

where the random variables Xα,ρ and Z are assumed to be independent.

Assume that (α,ρi)∈A, i = 1,2. Then

[formula]

where all random variables are assumed to be independent.

The next theorem is our second main result, where we establish a convergent series representation for ψα,ρ(x).

Assume that α∈(0,1) and ρ∈[0,1] and denote [formula]. Then

[formula]

The corresponding series expansions for ψα,ρ(x) when α∈(1,2] and ρ∈[1  -  α -  1,α -  1] can be obtained using [\eqref=duality_identity1], [\eqref=series_x_greater_than_A] and [\eqref=series_x_smaller_than_A], and the expressions for x < 0 follow from ψα,ρ(x) = ψα,1 - ρ( - x).

The series expansions [\eqref=series_x_greater_than_A] and [\eqref=series_x_smaller_than_A] have direct analogues in the case of classical stable distribution. The following result is given in [\cite=Zolotarev1986]: Let pα,ρ(x) denote the density of the random variable Yα,ρ, then for α∈(0,1) and ρ∈[0,1]

[formula]

and at the same time pα,ρ has the asymptotic expansion

[formula]

When x < 0 we have pα,ρ(x) = pα,1 - ρ(x). In the case α > 1 the situation is reversed: the series [\eqref=series_x_classical_2] gives a convergent series representation while [\eqref=series_x_classical_1] provides a complete asymptotic series for pα,ρ(x) as x  →    +    ∞  .

Our third main result is the series expansion for the characteristic function of the free stable distribution, defined as

[formula]

Assume that (α,ρ)∈A. Then for z > 0

[formula]

Note that for [formula] the value of [formula] is the conjugate of [formula], thus the series representation for [formula] when z < 0 follows at once from [\eqref=f_alpha_rho_series]. Formula [\eqref=f_alpha_rho_series] is a direct analogue of the corresponding series for the characteristic function of the classical stable distribution

[formula]

which can be easily obtained from [\eqref=def_g_alpha_rho].

Proofs

We denote the upper-half plane [formula] and similarly for the lower half-plane [formula]. For [formula] lying on the vertical line [formula] we define

[formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm_Mellin]: Our first goal is to establish identity [\eqref=eq_Mellin_1] for s∈( - 1,0). Assume that (α,ρ)∈A. Let γα,ρ  ⊂  - be the the curve given in polar coordinates

[formula]

where

[formula]

As explained in Lemma A1.1 in [\cite=BPB1999], γα,ρ is a closed simple curve lying in the lower half-plane. We consider this curve as the boundary of a Jordan domain Ωα,ρ. As was shown in Lemma A1.1 in [\cite=BPB1999], the function Gα,ρ(z) is a one-to-one conformal transformation from [formula] onto Ωα,ρ, which extends continuously to the boundary. Thus Gα,ρ gives a homeomorphism of [formula] with [formula]. Let us define

[formula]

One can check that 1 / z*  +  φα,ρ(1 / z*) = 0. This shows that Gα,ρ(z) (being the inverse of 1 / z + φα,ρ(1 / z)) maps the positive real line (0,  ∞  ) onto the curve

[formula]

Since Gα,ρ(0) = z* and Gα,ρ( +   ∞  ) = 0, the curve γ+ is traversed in the direction from z* to 0.

The fact that Gα,ρ(z) is the inverse of 1 / z + φα,ρ(1 / z) implies

[formula]

We know that Gα,ρ(x)  →  0 as x  →    ∞  , and formula [\eqref=eqn_w_x] shows that

[formula]

At the same time, since the function 1 / z + φα,ρ(1 / z) is analytic and has a non-vanishing derivative at z = z*, its inverse function Gα,ρ(z) is analytic in the neighborhood of zero. By the inversion formula for the Cauchy transform we have

[formula]

therefore for s∈( - 1,0)

[formula]

The above integral exists for all s∈( - 1,0) due to [\eqref=eq_asymptotics_G] and the fact that Gα,ρ(x) is analytic in the neighborhood of x = 0. The main step of the proof is to make a change of variables w = Gα,ρ(x) in the above integral. From [\eqref=eqn_w_x] we find

[formula]

Using the above result and the fact that Gα,ρ((0,  ∞  )) = γ+, we rewrite the integral in [\eqref=formula_Ms_integral] as follows:

[formula]

Note that both integrals in the right-hand side of [\eqref=computing_M_s_eq1] are finite for s∈( - 1,0). Let us compute the first integral in the right-hand side of [\eqref=computing_M_s_eq1]: we make a substitution w = uz* and obtain

[formula]

where L: = γ+ / z* (L is the curve γ+ rotated by the angle πρ). It is clear that L connects points 0 and 1 (in the direction 1  ↦  0) and [formula] (except for the endpoints). The function w  ↦  f(w) = (1 - wα)sw- s - 1 extends to [formula] analytically, and therefore we can deform the contour of integration L into an interval

[formula]

φ(z)= -eφ(-ez) = φ(z)

[formula]

E = ,  -1<s<1.

[formula]

E=Γ(2+(1-)s).

E = E ×,

[formula]

f(t) × = E = E=f(t) ×.

= sin(π (α-1) n) Γ(-1+(1-α)n) =O(n (x)),     n→ +∞,
