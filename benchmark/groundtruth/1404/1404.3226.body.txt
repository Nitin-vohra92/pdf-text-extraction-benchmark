Large time behavior for a nonlocal diffusion equation with absorption and bounded initial data: the subcritical case

Introduction

In this paper we continue our study of the large time behavior of the solution to the nonlocal diffusion equation with absorption

[formula]

where p > 1, [formula] and bounded and

[formula]

with [formula], radially symmetric, J  ≥  0 with [formula].

Our assumption on the initial datum is that [formula] and

[formula]

These kind of nonlocal diffusions appear in several applications such as population dynamics, disease propagation, image enhancement, etc (see, for instance, [\cite=BCh1] [\cite=BCh2] [\cite=BFRW] [\cite=BZ] [\cite=CF] [\cite=F] [\cite=GO] [\cite=Z].

When the kernel J in the nonlocal operator [\eqref=nonlocal-operator] satisfies the hypotheses in this paper, the long time behavior of the solutions is closely related to that of the corresponding problem for the heat operator with a diffusivity related to the kernel J (see, for instance, [\cite=ChChR] [\cite=GMQ] [\cite=IR1] [\cite=PR] [\cite=TW1] [\cite=TW2]).

In [\cite=PR] the authors started the study of [\eqref=problem] when [formula], in the supercritical case p > 1 + 2 / N. Then, in [\cite=TW1] [\cite=TW2] we studied this problem under assumption [\eqref=assumption-alpha].

The main question we address is what is the interplay between the parameters p, α and the dimension N in the large time behavior of the solution.

In [\cite=TW1] [\cite=TW2] the critical and supercritical cases were studied. This is, we assumed that, either [formula] and p  ≥  1 + 2 / N (completing the results of [\cite=PR] by considering the critical case), or 0 < α < N and p  ≥  1 + 2 / α. Also some intermediate asymptotics for u0 involving logarithms where considered in [\cite=TW2], always in the supercritical case.

In the present paper we complete our study by considering the subcritical case 1 < p < 1 + 2 / α that was left open in the previous articles.

The critical value pc = 1 + 2 / α is the one that makes diffusion and absorption of the "same size". It is interesting to observe that this critical value depends on the size of the initial condition at infinity.

In the supercritical case, diffusion wins and the reaction component disappears in the long run. In the critical case, both diffusion and reaction remain in the time asymptotics (see [\cite=PR] [\cite=TW1] [\cite=TW2]).

In the present paper we show that, in the subcritical case, only reaction remains in the large time behavior and the solution behaves as that of the equation

[formula]

This is

[formula]

for every k > 0.

It is interesting to observe that the final profile is independent of the initial datum u0 as long as it is bounded and satisfies [\eqref=assumption-alpha]. In the critical and supercritical cases, both the constant A and the exponent α in [\eqref=assumption-alpha] intervene in the time asymptotics.

Our result is similar to the one obtained by Gmira and Veron in [\cite=GMVE] for the heat equation with absorption. As in [\cite=GMVE], we get this behavior for any nonnegative and bounded initial datum u0 such that

[formula]

thus allowing a more general behavior of u0 at infinity than the one in [\eqref=assumption-alpha].

In this paper we follow the ideas of [\cite=GMVE] where the authors constructed subsolutions of separated variables with the right asymptotic behavior. These subsolutions involve the positive eigenfunctions hR of the laplacian in the balls BR, normalized so that the [formula].

The authors make use of the scaling invariance of the laplacian so that hR(x) = h1(x / R) and the principal eigenvalue λR = R- 2λ1.

One of the main differences when dealing with problem [\eqref=problem] is the lack of any scaling invariance of the problem. Nevertheless, a parabolic scaling leads -in the limit of the scaling parameter going to infinity- to the heat equation with diffusivity [formula]. And this fact explains, in a way, the interplay between the time asymptotics of the nonlocal diffusion equation and that of the heat equation with diffusivity A(J), as was made clear in [\cite=TW2].

This scaling property was also the basis for the understanding of the behavior as |x|  →    ∞   of the solution to

[formula]

with Ω an open bounded set, studied in [\cite=CEQW].

One of the main contributions of the present paper is a thorough study of the positive eigenfunction HR to the nonlocal operator L in the ball BR with Dirichlet boundary conditions HR = 0 in [formula], normalized so that [formula].

This study was initiated in [\cite=GMRO] where the existence of a principal eigenvalue ΛR associated to a positive eigenfunction was proved. Moreover, in [\cite=GMRO] the authors proved that, asymptotically the principal eigenvalue behaves as that of the laplacian with diffusivity A(J). This is,

[formula]

In [\cite=GMRO] the authors also studied the associated eigenfunction in the L2 setting and they proved that, after rescaling to the unit ball with an L2 normalization, one gets convergence in L2 to the positive eigenfunction of the laplacian in the unit ball with Dirichlet boundary conditions and unit L2  -   norm.

In the present paper, due to the application to the study of the asymptotics of [\eqref=problem] we have in mind, we are interested in a different normalization and convergence. Namely, we normalize so that the L∞  -   norm is preserved and prove uniform convergence in the unit ball.

In order to get this kind of compactness, the arguments in [\cite=GMRO] cannot be applied. Instead, we get uniform bounds for the derivatives of the rescaled eigenfunctions [formula], on smaller balls Br with 0 < r < 1, by using an integral representation formula for HR and a precise decay in terms of R of HR in a neighborhood of the boundary of BR. To this end, we construct an upper barrier. This barrier also allows to get uniform smallness of the rescaled eigenfunctions and their limits in a neighborhood of ∂B1 that gives, in particular, uniform convergence in the whole ball. The uniform limit is then identified as being h1, the positive eigenfunction of the laplacian in the unit ball with Dirichlet boundary conditions and unit L∞  -   norm.

We believe that the results concerning the eigenfunctions HR are of independent interest.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we state the results of [\cite=GMRO] on the principal eigenvalue of the operator L with Dirichlet boundary conditions set in the ball BR. Then, in Section 3 we perform our study of the eigenfunctions associated to the principal eigenvalues in the L∞ setting. In Section 4 we construct a subsolution to [\eqref=problem] by following the ideas of [\cite=GMVE] for the heat equation. Due to the lack of any regularizing effect of the nonlocal operator, we need to prove that inf BRu(  ·  ,t) > 0 for every R > 0, t > 0 (Lemma [\ref=lema-inf-loc]). Finally, in Section 5 we prove our main result, namely that [\eqref=main-result] is satisfied.

Definitions and Preliminary Results

In this section we discuss notation and basic definitions. Moreover we state some previous results on the first eigenvalue of the nonlocal problem with Dirichlet boundary conditions in a ball.

Let R > 0 and define the ball of radius R as

[formula]

We denote by λR the first eigenvalue of the laplacian in BR. That is, λR verifies that there is a solution to the following problem,

[formula]

We know that λR is simple. Let us call hR the associated eigenfunction satisfying

[formula]

It is well known that, due to the scaling of the laplacian there holds that, λR = R- 2λ1.

We now consider the nonlocal eigenvalue problem,

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] is radially symmetric and J  ≥  0 with [formula].

It was proved in [\cite=GMRO] that such an eigenvalue exists, it is simple and moreover,

[formula]

with

[formula]

This is,

[formula]

Consequently, the first eigenvalue ΛR for the nonlocal problem [\eqref=NLeigen] behaves asymptotically as the first eigenvalue λR of the laplacian [\eqref=Lapleigen], as R tends to infinity.

Moreover, in [\cite=GMRO] the authors proved that ΛR is given variationally as

[formula]

Some results on the eigenfunctions

In this section we study the eigenfunctions of the nonlocal problem in the ball BR.

The eigenfunction problem was studied in [\cite=GMRO] in the L2 setting. This is, in [\cite=GMRO] the authors consider the family of eigenfunctions normalized as to have the L2(BR) - norm equal to 1 and prove that, when properly rescaled, they converge to the unique positive eigenfunction of the laplacian in the unit ball with L2(B1) - norm equal to 1.

In the present paper we are interested in the family HR of positive eigenfunctions normalized so that the L∞(BR) - norm is 1. We prove that, when properly rescaled, they converge to the unique positive eigenfunction of the laplacian in the unit ball with the same normalization. The convergence is uniform in the unit ball.

In order to get our result, we cannot use the compactness argument of [\cite=GMRO] that holds only in Lp for p <   ∞  . Instead, we use Arzelà-Ascoli. To this end, we get uniform estimates of the derivatives of the rescaled eigenfunctions on compact subsets of the unit ball. The argument is delicate and uses a precise decay, in terms of R, of HR in a neighborhood of the boundary of BR. This decay is obtained by comparison with a supersolution that we construct to this end. In this way we obtain uniform convergence on compact subsets of the unit ball.

The supersolution also allows us to prove that the rescaled eigenfunctions [formula] are smaller than any positive constant in a neighborhood of ∂B1 if R is large. This, in turn, gives that the convergence is uniform in the unit ball to a function that is continuous in the closure and vanishes on the boundary. This limit function is therefore h1.

In this way, we get our main result in this section. Namely,

Let L the operator in [\eqref=nonlocal-operator]. Let [formula], [formula] , HR = 0 in [formula], be the unique solution to

[formula]

obtained in [\cite=GMRO], with the normalization [formula] for x∈BR.

Let [formula] for x∈B1 and [formula] the positive eigenfunction of the laplacian in the unit ball such that [formula]. Then,

[formula]

For the proof of this theorem we need a couple of lemmas.

In order to prove that H is a weak solution to the equation, we let φ∈C∞0(B1) and,

[formula]

Since [formula] strongly in L2(B1) and R2ΛR  →  A(J)λ1, by taking limit as n tends to infinity we obtain,

[formula]

that is, H satisfies the equation [formula].

Our next result is the construction of a barrier for HR.

Assume [formula]. By using Taylor's expansion and the symmetry of J we get for x∈BR,

[formula]

Then,

[formula]

if R is large.

Here we have used that there exists a positive constant c such that,

[formula]

Finally, since λ1A(J)R- 2  =  ΛR + o(1), we get for R large enough,

[formula]

since 0  ≤  HR  ≤  1.

Recall that h1 is radially symmetric, radially decreasing, smooth with h1(0) = 1. Let η such that h1(x) = η(|x|).

Now we use the supersolution constructed in Lemma [\ref=barrier] in order to bound HR. There holds,

In Lemma [\ref=barrier] we found a constant C > 0 and R0 > 0 such that, for any [formula], R  ≥  R0, the function

[formula]

satisfies

[formula]

In order to be able to apply the comparison principle we need to show that, for some constant C0, there holds that

[formula]

And, in fact [\eqref=bound-w] holds if [formula].

Finally, by applying the Comparison Principle, the lemma is proved.

From this lemma we get the following corollary that will be used to bound the derivatives of [formula].

There exists a constant K > 0 such that

[formula]

Let R  ≤  |x| < R + 1. Then, if [formula], there holds that R - 1  ≤  |y| < R. Therefore,

[formula]

for a certain constant K > 0 and,

[formula]

In order to prove our main result in this section, we will use an integral representation formula for HR. To this end, let us recall some results on the fundamental solution to the operator ∂t  -  L.

In [\cite=ChChR] the authors found that the fundamental solution of the nonlocal operator ∂t  -  L in the whole space, is

[formula]

where δ is the Dirac mass at the origin in [formula] and ω is a smooth function.

Then, in [\cite=TW2] pointwise and integral estimates for w and its derivatives where obtained. In particular,

[formula]

and,

[formula]

We can now prove our main result in this section.

The proof follows from the Arzelá-Ascoli Theorem.

In order to get uniform estimates of the derivatives of [formula] let us observe that the first eigenfunction of [\eqref=NLeigen] is the unique bounded solution of the following non-homogeneous equation defined in the whole [formula],

[formula]

As the solution of [\eqref=problemx1] is defined in the whole space, it can be expressed in terms of the fundamental solution F = F(x,t) by means of the variation of constants formula. Thus, for t  ≥  0 we have

[formula]

For x∈BR, there holds that XBcR(x) = 0. Thus, we can rewrite [\eqref=ecH] for x∈BR as,

[formula]

Observe that we are free to select the parameter t in expression [\eqref=ecH1].

Let us now rescale the identity [\eqref=ecH1]. We have,

[formula]

In order to bound the derivatives of (i), (ii) and (iii) we will choose the value t = R2. First, let us estimate the derivative of (i). By [\eqref=estim2], since 0  ≤  HR  ≤  1, it follows that

[formula]

Similarly, since ΛR  ≤  CR- 2,

[formula]

Now, by using the pointwise estimate [\eqref=estim1], Corollary [\ref=coro-HR1] and the fact that supp (J * HR) = BR + 1 we can bound the derivative of (iii) as

[formula]

Assume now, |x|  ≤  r with 0 < r < 1. Then, if |y| > R we get that |Rx - y|  ≥  R(1 - r) and then,

[formula]

Thus, since (1 - e- R2)(1 - ΛR)  ≥  α0 > 0 for R  ≥  R0, we conclude that for every 0 < r < 1 there exists C > 0 such that,

[formula]

if R  ≥  R0.

We can apply Arzelà- Ascoli on every ball Br with 0 < r < 1 to get, for every sequence Rn  →    ∞   a subsequence [formula] uniformly convergent in Br. Then, a diagonal argument gives a subsequence uniformly convergent on every compact subset of B1 to a function H. By the previous lemmas, we know that H is a solution to

[formula]

Moreover, 0  ≤  H  ≤  1. Let us see that [formula] with H = 0 on ∂B1. In fact, we show that the subsequence [formula] converging to H uniformly on compact subsets of B1 is actually uniformly convergent in B1. In fact, we use Lemma [\ref=lema-barrera-HR] to get for ε > 0,

[formula]

if 1 - |x| < δ0 and R  ≥  R0.

On the other hand, for every x∈B1, by taking limit as k  →    ∞   we find that,

[formula]

if 1 - |x| < δ0.

Observe that, in particular, [formula] with H = 0 on ∂B1.

Then,

[formula]

On the other hand, due to the uniform convergence of [formula] to H in [formula],

[formula]

So that, the convergence is uniform in B1, [formula] with H = 0 on ∂B1. So that, H = h1 is independent of the subsequence and the theorem is proved.

Back to the evolutionary problem. Construction of a Barrier.

In this section we construct a barrier for the nonlocal problem which is similar to the one constructed in [\cite=GMVE] for the laplacian. This barrier is a function of separated variables involving the eigenfunctions HR studied in Section [\ref=sect-HR].

In order to be able to further analyze our solution u, we state a result that is needed because of the lack of a regularizing effect of the nonlocal diffusion equation.

We recall some results that can be found, for instance, in [\cite=TW1]. First, u∈L∞ and bounded by [formula]. Moreover, [formula] since [formula] is a solution to the equation and a comparison principle for bounded solutions holds (see, for instance [\cite=LW]).

Moreover, u(x,t) > 0 for every [formula], t > 0. In fact, let [formula]. Then, since [formula],

[formula]

Thus,

[formula]

so that, if u(x,t) = 0 for some [formula], t > 0 there holds,

[formula]

We deduce that u(y,s) = 0 in B1(x)  ×  (0,t) and, since [formula] is connected, a continuation argument gives that u = 0 in [formula]. But, by [\eqref=ineq-u],

[formula]

and [formula].

Therefore, u(x,t) > 0 in [formula].

Let us now prove [\eqref=eq-inf-loc]. In not, there exists a sequence {xn}  ⊂  BR such that [formula]. Without loss of generality we may assume that [formula]. Going back to [\eqref=ineq-u] and using that J * u(  ·  ,s) is a continuous function in [formula] we get

[formula]

We deduce that u = 0 in B1(x̄)  ×  (0,t), a contradiction.

Now, we construct the barrier.

We set w(x,t) = ψR(t)HR(x). Then, for x∈BR,

[formula]

Since ψR satisfies [\eqref=eq1], 0  ≤  HR  ≤  1 and [formula] we deduce that,

[formula]

As w(x,0) = ψR(0)HR(x)  ≤  u0(x) and w(x,t) = 0 in BcR  ×  (0,  ∞  ), we deduce by the comparison principle for sub- and super-solutions on bounded sets that,

[formula]

The function ψ can be computed explicitly (see [\cite=GMVE]). In fact, if c > 0,

[formula]

The following technical lemma was proved in [\cite=GMVE]. This result will be used later on in Section [\ref=sect-main] in order to obtain the region where we can identify the asymptotic behavior of u.

In [\cite=GMVE] the function φ was assumed continuous. But it is easy to see that this assumption is not needed.

Now, we prove a key lemma. Once again the goal is to establish a lower bound for u(  ·  ,t) by constructing an appropriate auxiliary function φ(R). This function will be used as an initial condition for the function ψR from Lemma [\ref=lema2.3] in the proof of Theorem [\ref=teo].

Suppose [formula] is such that

[formula]

and let u be the bounded solution to [\eqref=problem]. Then, for any t > 0 the following equivalent properties hold:

[formula].

[formula].

There exists a positive, non-increasing, real-valued function φ such that

[formula]

and,

[formula]

By [\eqref=ineq-u], for every t > 0,

[formula]

Thus, (i) holds.

Let us see that (i) ⇒   (ii).

If not, there exist Rn  →    ∞   and a constant C > 0 such that

[formula]

This in turn implies that there exists xn∈BRn such that

[formula]

If there exist R0 > 0 and a subsequence Rnk such that {xnk}  ⊂  BR0 we would have, by [\eqref=eq-Rn] and Lemma [\ref=lema-inf-loc],

[formula]

which is a contradiction. Therefore, |xn|  →    ∞   as n  →    ∞  . But then, since xn∈BRn, by (i),

[formula]

which again is a contradiction. So, (ii) holds.

(ii) ⇒   (iii). We define for R > 0

[formula]

where HR is the positive eigenfunction of [\eqref=NLeigen] with [formula]. As u(x,t) / HR  ≥  u(x,t) in BR, there holds that φ(R) is positive.

From [\eqref=eccc] we have in BR, and, as 0  ≤  HR(x)  ≤  1,

[formula]

by (ii). So that, (iii) holds.

(iii) ⇒   (ii). In fact, by Theorem [\ref=teo-HR] we know that

[formula]

Since h1(x)  ≥  β > 0 in B1 / 2, there holds that

[formula]

if R  ≥  R0.

This is,

[formula]

if R  ≥  R0. Hence,

[formula]

if R  ≥  R0.

Multiplying by [formula], taking infimum over BR / 2 and letting R  →    ∞   gives (ii).

(ii) trivially implies (i).

Observe that the function φ(R) depends on t > 0.

Main result

In this section we prove our main result. This is, we obtain the large time behavior of u in the subcritical case 1 < p < 1 + 2 / α.

Suppose [formula] satisfies [\eqref=cond-alpha]. Let u(x,t) be the bounded solution of [\eqref=problem]. Then,

[formula]

uniformly on the sets

[formula]

where k is an arbitrary constant.

From Proposition [\ref=prop.phi], by considering u(x,t) for t  ≥  t0 > 0 we deduce that there is no loss of generality in assuming that there exists a nondecreasing function [formula] satisfying [\eqref=cond.phi] such that,

[formula]

From Lemma [\ref=lema2.3] we have that u(x,t)  ≥  HR(x)ψR(t) in [formula], where ψR is the solution of

[formula]

By [\eqref=comport] the principal eigenvalue of [\eqref=NLeigen] we can written in the form

[formula]

where λ1 is the principal eigenvalue of [\eqref=Lapleigen] and CR  →  A(J) as R  →    ∞   with A(J) given by [\eqref=ccte]. By using [\eqref=lamm] and [\eqref=soll] we have

[formula]

By using the Taylor expansion for e- CRλ1(p - 1)tR- 2 at the origin we get,

[formula]

Now, as lim R  →    ∞R2φp - 1(R) =   ∞   we deduce from Lemma [\ref=lema2.2] that there exists a nondecreasing function t  ↦  R(t) such that

[formula]

Replacing R by R(t) in [\eqref=ec1] and using [\eqref=ec2] yields

[formula]

If we consider x such that [formula] for some constant k, we have

[formula]

Since [formula] is a supersolution for t > 0, and u is bounded there holds that,

[formula]

Now, let us prove that

[formula]

uniformly on [formula] for all k > 0. In fact, from the uniform convergence on B1 obtained in Theorem [\ref=teo-HR], for every ε > 0 there exists t1 > 0 such that,

[formula]

On the other hand, if [formula] and we put x = R(t)y, we get that

[formula]

and consequently, if [formula]

[formula]

From the continuity of h1 it follows that,

[formula]

Hence, from [\eqref=eet1] and [\eqref=eet2] we obtain that,

Since h1(0) = 1, [\eqref=ek] follows.

Taking limit as t  →    ∞   in [\eqref=eq2] and using [\eqref=ek] we obtain that

[formula]

uniformly on [formula] and the proof is finished.
