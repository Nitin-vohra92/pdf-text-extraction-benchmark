Hermite expansions of C0-groups and cosine functions

Introduction

Representations of functions through expansions of orthogonal polynomials such as Legendre, Hermite or Laguerre are well known in the classical analysis. They allow to approximate functions by series of orthogonal polynomials on different types of convergence: a pointwise way, uniformly in certain sets, or in Lebesgue norm. Two classical monographs where we can find this kind of results are [\cite=Lebedev] and [\cite=Szego]. In this paper we are concentrated on Hermite expansions.

For all [formula] classical Hermite polynomials are defined by Rodrigues' formula

[formula]

We mention an interesting theorem which may be found in [\cite=Lebedev] and whose original statement was given in [\cite=Uspensky]. Although this result holds for functions which are more general that stated in the next theorem (see, for example [\cite=Lebedev] and [\cite=Szego]) the following version is sufficient for our purposes.

Let [formula] be a differentiable function such that [formula]. Then the series [formula] where

[formula]

converges pointwise to f(t) for [formula].

For [formula], we consider the exponential function eλ where eλ(t): = eλt for [formula]. Observe that the function eλ is expressed in a Hermite expansion by

[formula]

for [formula], see [\cite=Lebedev].

Now let [formula] with a > 0 for [formula] This function also satisfies the hypothesis of Theorem [\ref=ExpEsc], and we write

[formula]

Different aspects of Hermite expansions have been studied in the literature: for example, the asymptotic behavior of coefficients in [\cite=Boyd]; expansions of analytic functions in [\cite=Rusev]; and estimations of coefficients and integrals related with Hermite expansions in [\cite=Muckenhoupt1].

Other approximation results involve Hermite functions defined by

[formula]

These functions form an orthonormal basis of the Hilbert space [formula] Moreover, let f be in [formula] [formula] and [formula] for [formula]. Then [formula] as n  →    ∞  , with

[formula]

see [\cite=Askey].

Also these Hermite series allow to approximate temperated distributions. Let S be the Schwartz class and S' the space of temperated distribution on [formula]. Then the equality

[formula]

holds in the weak sense, see for example [\cite=Reed]. Moreover, Hermite expansions of Dirac distribution and the distribution principal value of [formula] may be found in [\cite=AMS] and [\cite=CMO]. Hermite expansions of products of temperated distributions are considered in detail in [\cite=CMO].

In other hand, a C0-group [formula] is a one parameter (strongly continuous) family of linear and bounded operators on a Banach space X, which satisfies the exponential law, i.e., T(t + s) = T(t)T(s) for all [formula] and T(0) = I. The (densely defined) operator A given by

[formula]

when the limit exists (x∈D(A)), is called the infinitesimal generator of C0-group; moreover, for [formula],

[formula]

see more details in monographs [\cite=ABHN] [\cite=Nagel]. This family of operators is interpreted as [formula] since it is the solution of the abstract Cauchy problem of first order. Likewise, it seems natural to consider identity ([\ref=expo]) in the vector-valued version, and we have that

[formula]

for x∈D(A), Theorem [\ref=loc] (ii), where T(g)(z) is a holomorphic C0-semigroup of angle [formula] whose generator is A2. It would be nice to obtain the larger domain (might be the domain of fractional powers of - A, D(( - A)α), with 0 < α < 1) where the Hermite expansion converges.

We also consider the second order abstract Cauchy problem, whose solutions may be expressed in terms of cosine functions. A cosine function [formula] is a one-parameter (strongly continuous) family of linear and bounded operators on a Banach space X, which satisfies C(t + s) + C(t - s) = 2C(t)C(s) for [formula] and C(0) = I. The (densely defined) operator A given by

[formula]

for x∈D(A), is the generator of the cosine function; moreover, for [formula],

[formula]

see other details in [\cite=ABHN]. In Theorem [\ref=loc2] (ii), we show that

[formula]

for x∈D(A); in this case A also generates a holomorphic C0-semigroup of angle [formula], [formula]. Note that this Hermite expansion extends the formula ([\ref=coseno]).

In the literature, there exist many different approximations of C0-semigroups, as Euler, Yosida, Dunford-Segal or subdiagonal Padé approximations, see [\cite=Gomilko] and references in [\cite=Abadias]. However there are not some many approximations of C0-groups and cosine functions: stable rational approximations for exponential function are considered to treat hyperbolic problems, i.e., C0-groups in [\cite=BT] and cosine functions in [\cite=jara]. In [\cite=Ba], the author approximates the solution of fractional Cauchy problem of order α  ≥  1 and gives the rate of convergence; the case of cosine functions is included for α = 2.

The paper is organized as follows. In the second section, we consider the functions [formula] (for [formula]) which have a key role in Theorem [\ref=ExpEsc]. They satisfy interesting properties, similar to Hermite polynomials (Proposition [\ref=propHerm]). We estimate their p-norm in Theorem [\ref=main2] and obtain Hermite expansions for Dirichlet and Fejér kernels in Proposition [\ref=kernel]. We also consider Hermite expansions in Lebesgue space [formula] for 1  ≤  p <   ∞  . Finally, we give a vector-valued version of Theorem [\ref=ExpEsc] on an abstract Banach space X.

Main theorems of this paper appear in the third and forth sections. In Theorem [\ref=loc] and Theorem [\ref=loc2], we express C0-groups and cosine functions though Hermite expansions. In Theorem [\ref=rate1] and Theorem [\ref=rate2], we give the rate of the Hermite expansions to the C0-group and cosine function respectively, which depends on the regularity of the initial data. We compare with the Laguerre expansions obtained for the case of C0-semigroups in [\cite=Abadias]. Two consequences of these Hermite expansions for C0-groups and cosine functions are the Hermite expansions for Féjer operators (Corollary [\ref=corola] and Theorem [\ref=rate2] (iv)) and series representations for subordinated holomorphic semigroups (Theorem [\ref=loc] (iii) and [\ref=loc2](iii)).

Although, cosine functions and C0-semigroups differ really (see for example [\cite=Bobrowski]), the nature of C0-groups and cosine functions are quite similar. In the case of Hermite expansions, analogous results hold (compare Theorem [\ref=loc] and [\ref=loc2]) and both approaches are compatible, see Remark [\ref=conn] and subsection [\ref=sub].

In the last section, we present some examples of C0-groups and cosine functions and their Hermite expansions: shift and multiplication groups, cosine functions on sequence spaces, and matrix approach to cosine functions and C0-groups. We also give some comments and open questions to motivate forthcoming papers in this topic.

Notation. Given 1  ≤  p  <    ∞  , let [formula] be the set of Lebesgue p-integrable functions, that is, f is a measurable function and

[formula]

for p = 2, remind that [formula] is a Hilbert space with 〈    ,    〉 the usual inner product, and [formula] the set of essential bounded Lebesgue functions with the norm [formula] We call [formula] the set of continuous functions defined in ( -   ∞  ,  ∞  ) such that [formula] with the norm [formula]

Hermite functions and Hermite expansions on Banach spaces

Hermite polynomials are solutions of second order differential equation

[formula]

Furthermore, they satisfy the following condition of orthogonality:

[formula]

where δn,m is the Kronecker delta. These polynomials satisfy the following properties:

[formula]

[formula]

for [formula].

From here on out, Muckenhoupt estimates for Hn and Hn, which are well known in the classical theory of orthogonal polynomials, will be used several times: there exist constants γ > 0 and C > 0 (independent of n and t) such that

[formula]

where N = 2n + 1 for all n  ≥  0, see [\cite=Muckenhoupt]. Therefore, given [formula] and [formula] such that t2  ≤  2(2n0 + 1), there exists C > 0 (independent of n0 and t) such that

[formula]

where we have applied the first inequality of Muckenhoupt estimates [\eqref=mucken].

Now we consider briefly the following functions. The Dirichlet kernel [formula] is defined by

[formula]

and the Fejér kernel [formula] by

[formula]

Note that [formula] and [formula] for [formula] see more details in [\cite=Katnelson]. Observe that Dirichlet and Fejér kernels satisfy the conditions of Theorem [\ref=ExpEsc] and we obtain their Hermite expansions.

Fixed [formula], we have that:

[formula]

As dt(s) =  - d- t(s) for [formula], we have that c2n(d(  ·  )(s)) = 0 for n  ≥  0 and

[formula]

for n  ≥  1, and [formula]. Using similar ideas, we show that c2n - 1(f(  ·  )(s)) = 0 for n  ≥  1,

[formula]

for [formula] and n  ≥  1.

For [formula], we denote by hn the family of functions defined by

[formula]

Note that

[formula]

with [formula]. As the Hermite polynomials, these functions satisfy recurrence relations and differential equations. We collect some of them in the following proposition which we will use later. We apply formulae [\eqref=pro4] and [\eqref=ecdif] to show parts (i) and (ii). The complete proof is left to the reader.

The family of functions {hn}n  ≥  0 satisfies:

2(n + 1)hn + 1(t) = 2thn(t) - hn - 1(t), for [formula] and n  ≥  1.

hn''(t) + 2thn'(t) + 2(n + 1)hn(t) = 0, for [formula] and n  ≥  0.

[formula] for n,k  ≥  0.

Take 1  ≤  p <   ∞  .

The set of functions [formula] and

[formula]

For n  ≥  1,

[formula]

where Z(Hn) is the set of zeros of Hn.

(i) Note that |hn| is an even function by [\eqref=pro1]. Then we divide the integral in two parts to apply the Muckenhoupt estimates [\eqref=mucken]. For N = 2n + 1, and t2  ≤  2N, we have that

[formula]

On the other hand, we have that

[formula]

and we obtain the inequality for 1  ≤  p <   ∞  .

For n  ≥  1, note that

[formula]

where we have applied Proposition [\ref=propHerm] (iii) to get the second inequality. To show the first equality, due to [formula], we obtain that

[formula]

where we have used Proposition [\ref=propHerm] (iii) and (i) to get the result.

Now we consider the expansions of certain functions Hermite polynomials in spaces [formula]. This result will be used to prove that the span{hn    |n   ≥   0} is dense for all 1  ≤  p <   ∞  . Observe the set [formula] is dense in [formula] ([\cite=Szego]) and in [formula] ([\cite=Szego]).

Take 1  ≤  p  <    ∞  .

Let [formula], and ηλ(t): = e- t2eλt for [formula]. Then we have that

[formula]

The set span{hn    |n   ≥   0} is dense in [formula]

(i) By ([\ref=expo]), we get that [formula] pointwise for [formula]. This convergence is in [formula] since

[formula]

where we have applied Theorem [\ref=main2] (i) and Stirling's formula.

(ii) Using the part (i), it is enough to see that span[formula] is dense in [formula] to get the result. To do this, we apply the Hahn-Banach Theorem. Let [formula] with [formula] such that

[formula]

By Hölder inequality, [formula] and then [formula] for all [formula] where

[formula]

is the classical Fourier transform. Since the Fourier transform is injective in [formula], we conclude that f = 0.

To show the main theorem of this section, Theorem [\ref=expvect], we adapt the proof given in [\cite=Lebedev] in the scalar case to the vector-valued setting. Note that this proof is based in a technical lemma which also has to be reproved to the vector-valued case [\cite=Lebedev]. We give the statement of this new lemma and we avoid its proof which runs parallel to the original one.

Let (X,||  ||) be a Banach space and [formula] a continuous function such that [formula] Then

[formula]

We need to remind the differentiability of vector-valued functions to give a vector-valued version of classical Theorem [\ref=ExpEsc]. Let [formula] be a vector-valued function, we say that f is differentiable at t if exists

[formula]

on (X,||  ||). In this case, f is continuous at t, see more details, for example in [\cite=ABHN].

Let X be a Banach space and [formula] a differentiable function such that the integral [formula] is finite, then the series [formula] with

[formula]

converges pointwise to f(t) for [formula]

By the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality, we get that cn(f)∈X,

[formula]

where we have applied that {Hn}n  ≥  0 is a orthonormal basis in [formula] and f satisfies the hypothesis.

Let Sm(f) be the sum of the first m + 1 terms of the series,

[formula]

where

[formula]

Note that Km(t,y) = Km(y,t), [formula] and

[formula]

see these properties in [\cite=Lebedev].

Now, we write

[formula]

where

[formula]

Observe that as function of y, φ(t,  ·  ) is continuous in [formula] for any [formula],

[formula]

since φ(t,  ·  ) is bounded in any neighborhood of y = t, and for sufficiently large b > t,

[formula]

is finite by hypothesis. Similarly we estimate the integral for the interval ( -   ∞  ,b). Then we apply twice the Lemma [\ref=lematec] to the function φ(t,  ·  ) to get that

[formula]

Finally, the following expressions remain bounded when m  →    ∞  :

[formula]

using [\cite=Lebedev] and Stirling's formula. We conclude that [formula] for [formula].

Hermite expansions for C0-groups

In this section, we approximate C0-groups by their Hermite expansions. A different approach, using stable rational approximations, is posed in [\cite=BT]. The rate of convergence depends on the smoothness of initial data in both cases, compare [\cite=BT] and Theorem [\ref=rate1] (ii). We also give a new serie representation for holomorphic semigroups (Theorem [\ref=loc] (iii)) and the Hermite expansion for Féjer operators (Corollary [\ref=corola]), both families of operators are subordinated to the initial C0-group.

First of all, we give some basic results from C0-group theory. Given (A,D(A)) a closed operator on a Banach space X, the resolvent operator λ  →  (λ - A)- 1 is analytic in the resolvent set, and

[formula]

see [\cite=Nagel]. It is known that A generates a C0-group, [formula], if and only if ±  A generates a C0-semigroup. Every C0-group is exponentially bound, i.e., there exist M,ω  ≥  0 such that [formula] for all [formula] For α > 0 and [formula] the fractional powers of the resolvent operator is defined by see [\cite=Komatsu]. Note that the operator (A2,D(A2)) generates a holomorphic C0-semigroup of angle [formula],

[formula]

for x∈X, see [\cite=ABHN]. We say that a C0-group is uniformly bounded if [formula] for all [formula] For further details see, for example, monographies [\cite=ABHN] [\cite=Nagel].

Let [formula] be a C0-group on a Banach space X with infinitesimal generator (A,D(A)).

For [formula], we get that

[formula]

In the case that [formula], we have that

[formula]

.

For x∈D(A), the following equality holds:

[formula]

In the case that [formula], we have that

[formula]

for x∈X.

(i) For [formula], we obtain

[formula]

for x∈X, where we have integrated by parts. Then the result is obtained. In the case that [formula], we apply Remark [\ref=remark] to get the bound.

(ii) Note that [formula] for x∈X, the function [formula] is differentiable at every point and [formula], for [formula] and x∈D(A). Then, we apply Theorem [\ref=expvect] to get

[formula]

as m  →    ∞  , for all [formula].

(iii) By the part (i) and Stirling's formula, we have that

[formula]

for x∈X and [formula]. Then we define the analytic family of operators

[formula]

Note that for x∈D(A2), we have that

[formula]

Since A2 generates a holomorphic C0-semigroup of angle [formula] and [formula] then we have that F(t) = T(g)(t) for [formula] by the uniqueness of the solution of the first order abstract Cauchy problem, see for example [\cite=ABHN]. Applying the principle of analytic continuation we conclude that F(z)x = T(g)(z)x for x∈X and [formula].

As we have commented, it is important to know the rate of approximation of truncated Hermite expansion to the C0-group. This theory has a key role in many areas of maths, as in PDE's, harmonic analysis or numerical analysis. Before to calculate the order of convergence in Theorem [\ref=rate1], we prove the following technical lemma.

Let [formula] be a uniformly bounded C0-group in a Banach space X with infinitesimal generator (A,D(A)) and p a positive integer number. Then

[formula]

for x∈D(Ap), n  ≥  p and C a positive constant.

We define by [formula] for x∈X, see Theorem [\ref=loc] (i). For x∈D(Ap), we apply Proposition [\ref=propHerm] (iii) and integrate by parts to get that

[formula]

where we have used that [formula] for [formula] By Theorem [\ref=main2] (i) for p = 1, we conclude that

[formula]

for x∈D(Ap).

We define the m-th partial sum of the Hermite expansion,

[formula]

for m  ≥  0, and we are interested to estimate the rate of convergence of the m-th partial sum [formula] to the C0-group [formula].

Let [formula] be a uniformly bounded C0-group on a Banach space X with infinitesimal generator (A,D(A)). Then for each [formula] there is a [formula] such that for m  ≥  m0 and 2  ≤  p  ≤  m + 1,

[formula]

Moreover, the convergence is locally uniformly in t.

Fix [formula]. By inequalities ([\ref=mucken2]) and [\eqref=lemaeq], there is a [formula] such that for m  ≥  m0,

[formula]

for x∈D(Ap). The locally uniformly convergence is clear, since if [formula] is compact it is sufficient to take the maximum of all m0 ( a finite number of m0 due to the compactness of K) for which the pointwise convergence is satisfied.

.

Finally, let [formula] be a uniformly bounded C0-group on a Banach space X and we consider the family of operators

[formula]

for x∈X and N  ≥  1 (functions dt and ft are considered in Section 1). The uni-parametric family [formula] is a Fejér family and is studied in detail in [\cite=Fasangova]. In the case that X is a UMD Banach space then there exists lim N  →    +    ∞DTN(t)x for x∈X and defined bounded operators, called [formula] a Dirichlet family, see [\cite=Fasangova].

Let X be a Banach space and [formula] a uniformly bounded C0-group on X. For x∈X and [formula], we have that

[formula]

We use Proposition [\ref=kernel] to express the Féjer kernel in its Hermite expansion. We need to commute the integral and the serie. Note that the vector-valued coefficients of the expansion ([\ref=fejer2]) are bounded by [formula] where c2n(f(  ·  )) is the coefficient of Hermite expansion of Féjer kernel given in Proposition [\ref=kernel]. Then

[formula]

where we have applied that

[formula]

see [\cite=Gradshteyn]. Then we have that

[formula]

where we have used Muckenhoupt estimates [\eqref=mucken2] and Stirling's formula. Therefore the serie is absolutely convergent and we obtain the result.

Hermite expansions for cosine functions

In this section we consider operator families related to the second order Cauchy problem, the cosine and sine functions. We obtain their Hermite expansions (Theorem [\ref=loc2] (ii)) and a new representation serie for subordinated holomorphic semigroup (Theorem [\ref=loc2] (iii)). We present that Hermite expansions for C0-group and Hermite expansions for cosine functions are consistent, see Remark [\ref=conn]. We also give the rate of convergence of the truncated Hermite expansion to the cosine function, Theorem [\ref=rate2] (iii).

Let X be a Banach space and [formula] a cosine function, see definition in the Introduction or [\cite=ABHN]. All cosine functions are even, exponentially bounded, [formula] with M  ≥  1 and w  ≥  0, and

[formula]

where A is the generator of [formula] The Euler approximation for cosine functions (for C0-semigroups, see for example [\cite=ABHN] and [\cite=Gomilko]),

[formula]

is a consequence of the Post-Widder inversion formula for the Laplace transform (see for example [\cite=ABHN]). Other different approach is followed in [\cite=jara] where stable rational schemes are used to approximate cosine functions.

Observe that A generates a holomorphic C0-semigroup of angle [formula],

[formula]

for x∈X, see for example [\cite=ABHN]. There are other operators associated to the second order Cauchy problem. The sine function [formula] associated with C is defined by

[formula]

Observe that S is an odd function; see more details in [\cite=ABHN].

Let [formula] be a cosine function on a Banach space X with infinitesimal generator (A,D(A)).

For [formula], we get that

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

In the case that [formula], we have that

[formula]

For x∈D(A), the following Hermite expansions hold: and

In the case that [formula], the following series representation holds:

[formula]

for x∈X.

(i) Since h2n + 1 is an odd function and h2n is even, first identities are shown for [formula]. On the other hand,

[formula]

for x∈X, and

[formula]

(ii) Note that [formula] for x∈X; the function [formula] is twice differentiable at every point and [formula] for x∈D(A), see [\cite=ABHN]. Then we apply Theorem [\ref=expvect] and we have that

[formula]

as m  →    ∞  , for all [formula] . By the fundamental theorem of calculus, [formula] is also differentiable at every point, and the rest is a simple check.

(iii) The proof runs parallel to the proof of Theorem [\ref=loc](iii).

Following the same type of arguments as in the previous section, we give the order of convergence of truncated Hermite expansions [formula] where

[formula]

and

[formula]

for [formula] x∈X and m  ≥  0, to the cosine and sine functions, [formula] and [formula] respectively. We also give the Hermite expansion of subordinated Féjer families, [formula], where

[formula]

see [\cite=Fasangova].

Let [formula] be a uniformly bounded cosine funtion on a Banach space X with infinitesimal generator (A,D(A)).

Let p be a positive integer. Then for x∈D(Ap) and n  ≥  p, we get

[formula]

with C a positive constant.

Let p be a integer greater or equal than zero. Then for x∈D(Ap + 1) and n  ≥  p, we get

[formula]

with C a positive constant.

Then for each [formula] there is a [formula] such that for m  ≥  m0, and 1  ≤  p  ≤  m + 1, we have that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Moreover, the convergence is locally uniformly in t.

For x∈X and [formula], the following equality holds:

[formula]

(i) We write [formula] for x∈X, see Theorem [\ref=loc2] (i). We apply Proposition [\ref=propHerm] (iii) and integrate by parts to obtain

[formula]

By Theorem [\ref=main2] (i), we get the following inequality

[formula]

for x∈D(Ap).

(ii) Note that integrating by parts, and using Proposition [\ref=propHerm] (iii) and above part (i), the inequality

[formula]

holds for x∈D(Ap + 1).

(iii) Following the same steps as in Theorem [\ref=rate1] and using part (i), we take [formula] and [formula] such that for all m  ≥  m0 with 1  ≤  p  ≤  m + 1,

[formula]

for x∈D(Ap).

Similarly using part (ii), we take [formula] and [formula] such that for all m  ≥  m0 with 1  ≤  p  ≤  m + 1,

[formula]

for x∈D(Ap + 1).

In both cases, the locally uniformly convergence in t is shown as in Theorem [\ref=rate1].

(iv) The proof of this part is similar to the proof of Corollary [\ref=corola].

Examples, remarks and final comments

In this last section we present some concrete examples of C0-groups and cosine functions and we apply our results to give their vector-valued Hermite expansions. We also comment some connections with well-known (scalar) Hermite expansions for temperated distributions. Finally we point out some open questions and interesting problems associated to other families of operators.

Shift group and cosine function

Let [formula] with 1  ≤  p <   ∞  . The shift group (or translation group) in [formula], [formula] defined by

[formula]

is an isometry C0-group (we denote by [formula] the usual Dirac delta distribution concentrated at t). The infinitesimal generator A is the usual derivation operator, [formula] Furthermore,

[formula]

where gz is the Gaussian kernel, [formula] for [formula] and [formula] By Theorem [\ref=loc] (ii), we obtain the formula

[formula]

where [formula] is the Sobolev space defined by [formula].

The distribution principal value of [formula] is a temperated distribution whose is expanded in terms of Hermite polynomials, see for example [\cite=AMS], [\cite=CMO]. In general, given [formula], a uniformly bounded C0-group in a UMD space X, the Hilbert transform HT associated to T is defined by

[formula]

see [\cite=Mo]. If we consider the shift group on [formula] with X a UMD Banach space and p∈(1,  ∞  ), T(t)f(: = f(  ·   - t), then

[formula]

is the classical Hilbert transform. Relations between Dirichlet and Féjer families and the Hilbert transform HT are studied in [\cite=Fasangova]. It would be interested to obtain the Hermite expansion of the bounded operator HT.

Now we define also in [formula], the isometry cosine function [formula] by

[formula]

The generator is [formula] and is clear that

[formula]

where [formula] is the Sobolev space defined by [formula].

Multiplication groups and cosine functions

Let (Ω,Σ,μ) be a σ-finite measure space, 1  ≤  p <   ∞   and the Lebesgue Banach space Lp(Ω). We consider the unitary C0-group [formula] in Lp(Ω) defined by

[formula]

where [formula] is a Lebesgue measurable function. The infinitesimal generator is A = iq, D(A) = {f∈Lp(Ω)    |    qf∈Lp(Ω)}. These multiplication groups are treated deeply in [\cite=Nagel]. Some known examples are the Fourier Transform of the Gaussian and Poisson semigroups, q(s) =  - s2 and q(s) =  - |s|; recently some interesting examples for [formula] and [formula] have been studied in [\cite=Campos].

Note that

[formula]

By Theorem [\ref=loc] (ii), we obtain that

[formula]

For [formula], we get the formula ([\ref=expo]).

Now we suppose that [formula] is a Lebesgue measurable function. We consider the cosine function [formula] in Lp(Ω) defined by

[formula]

whose generator is A = m, D(A) = {f∈Lp(Ω)    |    mf∈Lp(Ω)}. Note that

[formula]

where he have used [\cite=Badii]. By Theorem [\ref=loc2] (ii), we have that

[formula]

for [formula] and s∈Ω; in the particular case m(s) =  - a, (with a > 0) we obtain the formula ([\ref=coseno]).

Cosine functions on sequence spaces

Let [formula] be spaces of all complex sequence [formula] convergent to 0 equipped with the usual norm [formula] for X = c0; and ||x||p  <    ∞   where [formula] for [formula] with 1  ≤  p  <    ∞  .

For each [formula] let en be the element of X such that (en)k  =  δn,k the Kronecker delta. Every x∈X can be represented as the series [formula] The family of linear operators [formula] given by

[formula]

is a strongly continuous cosine family of contractions on X, generated by (A,D(A)) where

[formula]

and D(A) = {x∈X  |  (k2xk)∞k = 1∈X}. For X = c0, this example has been studied in [\cite=Bobrowski] in an approximation process.

Note that [formula] and

[formula]

In this case, for 1  ≤  p  <    ∞  , we have that

[formula]

Note that Theorem [\ref=loc2] (i) doesn't provide the optimal bound in this case. Then by Theorem 4.1 (ii), we get

[formula]

which is a vector-valued version of the identity ([\ref=coseno]).

Matrix approach to cosine functions and C0-groups

([\cite=ABHN]) Let A be an operator on a Banach space X. Then the following assertions are equivalent,

A generates a cosine function [formula] on X.

There exists a Banach space V such that [formula] and such that the operator B, given by with D(B): = D(A)  ×  V, generates a C0-group [formula] on V  ×  X with the norm [formula]. In this case where [formula] for x∈X and [formula].

Applying Theorem 3.1 (ii), we expand C0-group [formula] through Hermite polynomials: for (x,y)∈D(B)

[formula]

where [formula] for n  ≥  0. Note that and where we have used that

[formula]

Then for [formula] In other hand, we apply Theorem [\ref=loc2](ii) to get that

[formula]

for (x,y)∈D(B) and [formula].

In the case that we consider the Banach space X  ×  X with the norm [formula], the operator A generates a cosine function if and only if (A,D(A)) generates a once integrated semigroup S on X  ×  X, where D(A) = D(A)  ×  X, see [\cite=ABHN] and [\cite=ABHN]. Hermite expansions for n-times integrated groups have not considered in the literature and seems to be natural to develop this theory. In [\cite=jara], stable rational approximations for exponential functions are considered to approximate n-times integrated semigroups (and then cosine functions) for smooth initial data. Both approaches might be compared in a forthcoming paper.
