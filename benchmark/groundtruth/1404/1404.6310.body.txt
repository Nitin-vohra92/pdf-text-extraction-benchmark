Introduction

The Topological Complexity (TC) of a space X is, in practical terms, the smallest number of local domains in each of which there is a continuous motion planning algorithm. This number turns out to be a homotopy invariant and is denoted by TC(X), see [\cite=farber]. Recall that the space of configurations of k labeled points in X is given by

[formula]

This space turns out to be of crucial importance in algebraic topology and of course in many of its applications in fields such as robotics. This latter connection arises by noticing that a path in [formula] is essentially a set of k non-colliding paths in [formula].

A related concept is that of the orbit configuration space of a G-space X, which is defined as

[formula]

where Gx = {gx:g∈G} is the orbit x. For instance, the space [formula], where O(n) is the linear orthogonal group, is the subspace of [formula] consisting of configurations whose components are vectors of different lengths. Note that F1(X,k), where 1 is the trivial group, is just the space of configurations of k labeled points in X.

We will construct explicit motion planners on [formula] that realize the value of its TC when k is odd, and when k is even this number of motion planners is just one unit off the actual value of its TC. Before embarking into the construction of these planners we will provide a lower bound for their TC by constructing a retract of [formula] that realizes the value of TC of [formula] when n is odd, as well as the TC of some orbit configuration spaces.

The values of TC and the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category (cat) of [formula], had already been computed ([\cite=fy], [\cite=fg], [\cite=roth]), and for n,k  ≥  2 are given by

[formula]

and

[formula]

The conditions n,k  ≥  2 guarantee the space [formula] is a non-contractible, connected space. The contribution of this paper is two-fold, on one hand we show that no sophisticated machinery is needed to compute cat nor TC when n is odd; and on the other we find explicit motion planning algorithms for [formula] with 2k - 1 local rules, solving a problem posed in [\cite=farber]. Previous motion planning algorithms described in [\cite=farber2] consisted of k2 - k + 1 local rules.

Retracts for Configuration Spaces

In this section we will show that there exist retracts given by products of spheres sitting in the configuration spaces that we will consider. This will allow us to obtain lower bounds for cat and TC.

If G is a subgroup of O(m + 1), then there are retractions

[formula]

and

[formula]

To see these let

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

[formula]

where N(y)  =  y / |y|. Similarly, let us define

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

[formula]

These maps satisfy [formula], for i = 1,2. By definition βi lands in the respective product of spheres. One only needs to show that the map

[formula]

does land in [formula]. The case of α1 is analogous. It is easy to see that each coordinate of this map is non-zero. If [formula] for some A∈G  ⊆  O(m + 1) and p  ≥  1, then [formula]. Now, if any two vectors u and v satisfy |u| = |u + v|, then |v|  ≤  2|u|. Thus, if we take [formula] and [formula], then

[formula]

So [formula]. On the other hand,

[formula]

a contradiction. Therefore the vector [formula] does live in the configuration space [formula].

The arguments in the proof of the previous result can be used to show that there is also a retraction

[formula]

where Qr is a subset of fixed points with r elements. This follows from the homeomorphism induced between configuration spaces by a homeomorphism between [formula] and [formula], where [formula] is a subset of r fixed points of norm less than one (note that each component of the map α2 is a vector of norm greater than or equal to 1). The space [formula] is related to the collision free motion planning problem in the presence of multiple moving obstacles, see [\cite=fgy].

Suppose that Qr is a set of r points in [formula], then

[formula]

[formula]

Suppose that G is a finite subgroup of O(2m + 1) acting freely on [formula], then

[formula]

[formula]

Notice that there are fibrations of the form

[formula]

and

[formula]

where g is the order of G. An inductive argument shows that the space [formula] is (m - 1)-connected and homotopy equivalent to a finite CW-complex of dimension at most mk. Similarly, the space [formula] is (m - 1)-connected and homotopy equivalent to a CW complex of dimension at most m(k - 1) when r = 0, and of dimension at most mk when r > 0. To get a lower bound for cat and TC of these spaces we just need to apply Proposition [\ref=retraction], recall the fact that if X is dominated by Y then TC(X)  ≤  TC(Y), and also make use of the known values TC((S2m)k) = 2k + 1 and cat((Sm)k)  =  k + 1. For the upper bounds we can apply the following two properties: TC(X)  ≤  2cat(X) - 1; and if X is a q-connected finite CW-complex then [formula].

The value of [formula] and [formula] had already been computed in [\cite=fgy], and more recently for any Euclidean space in [\cite=gg].

Partitions on Configuration Spaces

Throughout this section we will be working with the space [formula], and we will keep k fixed. A vector of positive integers [formula] such that [formula] will be called a partition of k, and we will call the number |A|  =  l the number of levels of A. We will consider the (reverse) lexicographic order on [formula], that is: (b1,b2)  ≤  (c1,c2) if b2 < c2, or if b2 = c2 and b1  ≤  c1.

Now, if [formula] then there is a unique permutation σ∈Σk such that [formula]. This permutation will be denoted by σx, and if σx = 1 we will say that x is (lexicographically) ordered.

Let [formula] be the projection of the second factor. If [formula] is (lexicographically) ordered, then there are positive integers [formula] such that

[formula]

These of course define a partition [formula] of k. This partition will be denoted by Ax. Note that this partition tells us how the configuration x is sitting in [formula] with respect to the y-axis. In this context, |A| = l is the number of lines parallel to the x-axis on which the configuration x sits.

Given a partition [formula] of k and [formula], we will say that x is an A-configuration if Aσx(x)  =  A.

Given an A-configuration [formula], we will say that x has |A| levels and that xi and xj are on the same level if π2(xi) = π2(xj).

Given a partition A of k and a permutation σ∈Σk, we let

[formula]

We also define

[formula]

This latter is precisely the subspace of all A-configurations. Note that the subspaces FA,σ are disjoint, and that

[formula]

Suppose that [formula] is a limit point of FA,1, then |Ax|  ≤  |A|. The equality holds if and only if, Ax  =  A.

Suppose that |A| = l. Note that any element of a sequence of (lexicographically) ordered A-configurations converging to x defines a set of increasing real numbers [formula] which are determined by the map π2. Moreover, this latter set of real numbers depends continuously on the sequence converging to x. The position of the levels of x is determined by the limit of these real numbers, and since some of these may collapse into a single real number in the limit, it follows that |Ax|  ≤  |A|.

For the second part, it suffices to show that if |Ax|  =  |A| then Ax  =  A. This can be seen by noticing that the condition |Ax|  =  |A| tells us that the levels determined by the sequence do not collapse resulting in a smaller number of levels when converging to x, and hence x must be an A-configuration.

Note that since the subspaces FA,σ and FA,μ are homeomorphic for any two permutations σ,μ, it follows that the latter result holds for any FA,σ.

Suppose that [formula] is a limit point of FA,σ  ×  FB,μ. Then |Ax|  +  |Ay|  ≤  |A|  +  |B|, and the equality holds if and only if Ax  =  A and By  =  B.

The result follows from the following observation: if a,b,c,d are postive real numbers such that a  ≥  c, b  ≥  d, then a + b  ≥  c + d, and the equality holds if and only if a = c and b  =  d.

Recall that a space X is called ENR (Euclidean Neighborhood Retract) if it is homeomorphic to a subspace X' of some [formula] such that X' is a retract of an open neighborhood [formula]. Here we recall a definition of TC from [\cite=farber], Proposition 4.12.

Suppose that X is an ENR. The topological complexity of X is the smallest integer r such that there exists a section s:X  ×  X  →  XI of the double-evaluation map ε:XI  →  X  ×  X and a splitting [formula] such that:

[formula] when i  ≠  j,

the restriction of s to each Fi is continuous, and

each Fi is a locally compact subspace of X  ×  X.

Given i∈{2,...,2k}, we let

[formula]

Note that these Fi are disjoint and they cover [formula].

When k = 3, the first two Fi are given as follows

[formula]

Each FA,σ, FA and Fi are locally compact, locally contractible, and hence ENR.

If [formula] is a partition of k, then there is a homeomorphism

[formula]

where [formula]. This homeomorphism is obtained by projecting each level onto the x-axis, and by projecting each level onto the y-axis. Therefore FA,1 is homeomorphic to an open set of [formula], and thus each FA,σ, FA, and Fi are locally compact, and locally contractible. Finally, a subspace of [formula] is an ENR if and only if, it is locally compact and locally contractible [\cite=dold].

If V = FA,σ  ×  FB,μ  ⊂  Fi and [formula], then (x,y)∈Fj for some j < i.

Note that if x is a limit point of FA,σ and |Ax| = |A|, then x∈FA,σ. Now apply Corollary [\ref=limit_point].

Suppose that U and V are disjoint subspaces of [formula] such that [formula] and [formula] are empty. If f is a function from [formula] to [formula] such that f restricted to both U and V is continuous, then f is continuous on [formula].

These latter two results are crucial since they tell us that if we are able to find a planner on Fi then it will be continuous on Fi as long as it is continuous on each FA1,σ1  ×  FA2,σ2  ⊂  Fi.

Motion Planners

The following result will be a basic ingredient needed to construct motion planners and its proof will be omitted since it is straightforward.

Let [formula] be the projection of the first factor, and define [formula] by [formula]. The map p is continuous, and so is its restriction to [formula].

We will define a planner si on Fi by means of planners sA,σ,B,μ on each FA,σ  ×  FB,μ  ⊂  Fi, where i = |A| + |B|. Without loss of generality we will provide a recipe only for FA,1  ×  FB,1  ⊂  Fi:

Take a pair of configurations (x,y)∈FA,1  ×  FB,1  ⊂  Fi.

Each level of the A-configuration x will be connected by means of straight lines to a set of points on a line which is parallel to the y-axis and whose x-coordinate is given by p(x,y) + 1. More precisely, if [formula] and we let [formula], then

[formula] will be mapped onto the line X = p(x,y) + 1 by means of straight lines, x1 will go to the point on the line at height h1  -  |x1  -  xa1|, x2 will go to the point on the line at height h1  -  |x2 - xa1|, and so on.

For the next level, send xa1 + j to the point on the line X = p(x,y) + 1 at height

[formula]

for 1  ≤  j  ≤  a2.

Proceed as in (b) with each level of x.

This set of paths define a path Qx in [formula] connecting the configuration x to a configuration sitting on the line X = p(x,y) + 1.

We proceed with y the same way we did with x to obtain a path Qy except that in this case we use the line X = p(x,y) + 2 to avoid possible collisions in the following step.

Let α(x,y) be the path that connects by means of straight lines (following the order of both x and y) the configuration Qx(1) to the configuration Qy(1).

The motion planner is determined by the path from x to y given by Qx  ·  α(x,y)  ·  Q- 1y (concatenation of paths).

The following picture illustrates the construction of the path Qx when A = (3,2,1,2).

[formula]

The collection (Fi,si), 2  ≤  i  ≤  2k, forms a set of motion planning algorithms for [formula].

Higher dimensions and higher TC

For simplicity and convenience we will denote the coordinates of [formula] by [formula]. We can extend the ideas of partitions and levels to this scenario: given a configuration [formula], each level will be a hyperplane perpendicular to the zn-axis containing a number of elements of x, and this number of elements is a component of the partition determined by x. Now, given [formula], we define

[formula]

where π1 is the projection of the first factor, see Lemma [\ref=distance]. Then the elements on a level of x are connected to a configuration on the line Lx,y which is parallel to the zn-axis and intersects the z1-axis at p(x,y) + 1. The recipe spelled out for [formula] works for [formula], the only difference is that we will consider the lexicographic order on each level to assign to each point a point on the line Lx,y (this is implicit in step (2)(b) for [formula]).

The concept of higher topological complexity was developed in [\cite=bgrt]. The basic idea is that in this case the motion planning involves a set of (n - 2) prescribed intermediate stages that the system (robot) has to reach. This turns out to be an invariant and it is denoted by TCn. The case n = 2 is just that of TC. The arguments applied in the proof of Theorem [\ref=tc-inequalities] can be used in this context since the analogous ideas for TCn are available in [\cite=bgrt]. This allows us to obtain

[formula]

and if G is a finite subgroup of O(2m + 1) acting freely on [formula], then

[formula]

The value of [formula] was obtained in [\cite=gg]; their arguments, however, are way more elaborate.

It is also worth mentioning that the motion planning algorithms described in this paper can also be extended to the case of higher topological complexity. It is not hard to see what modifications are needed, and the details are left to the interested reader.

As we pinpointed in the introduction, the contribution of this paper resides more in the construction of the motion planners. This construction may be of more practical importance than just knowing the value of TC.

LS-category

The LS-category of [formula] has been computed in [\cite=roth] and it is equal to k when n  ≥  2. We will construct a categorical cover that realizes this value. Consider the sets

[formula]

where [formula] and notice that they are ENR by Lemma [\ref=enr]. Now we use the following result from [\cite=dold].

If W is a subspace of X and both are ENR, then there is an open neighborhood W  ⊂  U  ⊂  X and a retraction r:U  →  W such that the natural inclusion j:U  →  X is homotopic to [formula], where i is the natural inclusion map of W into X.

The subspaces Wi, 1  ≤  i  ≤  k, can be enlarged to define a categorical covering for [formula].

Note that each Wi is contractible in [formula] by using the ideas from steps (1) and (2) in the defintion of the motion planners and by connecting the resulting configurations on the corresponding line (see step (2)(a)) to a fixed configuration in [formula]. A straightforward application of the previous result allows us to enlarge each subspace Wi to an open subset [formula] so that Ui is contractible in [formula]. The fact that k is the smallest possible size of a categorical covering is a consequence of Proposition [\ref=retraction]. Therefore the subsets [formula] define a categorical cover of [formula].
