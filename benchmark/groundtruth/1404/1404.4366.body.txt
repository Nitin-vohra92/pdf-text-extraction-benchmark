Comment on "Kinetic theory for a mobile impurity in a degenerate Tonks-Girardeau gas"

In a recent paper [\cite=Lancaster] Gamayun, Lychkovskiy, and Cheianov studied the dynamics of a mobile impurity weakly coupled to a one-dimensional Tonks-Girardeau gas of strongly interacting bosons. Employing the Boltzmann equation approach, they arrived at the following conclusions: (i) a light impurity, being accelerated by a constant force, F, does not exhibit Bloch oscillations, which were predicted and studied in Refs. [\cite=Gang_Kam] [\cite=Schec1]; (ii) a heavy impurity does undergo Bloch oscillations, accompanied by a drift with the velocity [formula].

In this comment we argue that the result (i) is an artifact of the classical Boltzmann approximation. The latter misses the formation of the (quasi) bound-state between the impurity and a hole. Its dispersion relation Eb(P,ρ) is a smooth periodic function of momentum P with the period 2kF = 2πρ, where ρ is a density of the host gas. Being accelerated by a small force, such a bound-state exhibits Bloch oscillations superimposed with the drift velocity vD  =  μF. The mobility μ may be expressed exactly [\cite=Schec1] in terms of Eb(P,ρ). Result (ii), while not valid at exponentially small forces, indeed reflects an interesting intermediate-force behavior.

The origin of Bloch oscillations is most transparent for a weakly interacting Bose gas, described by the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation. Its solution reveals that a repulsive impurity binds to a dark soliton - a region of depleted host gas. The resulting composite object (the "depleton") has a periodic dispersion curve and thus exhibits Bloch oscillations, if a sufficiently small force is applied to the impurity. In a strongly interacting Bose gas the GP approach is not applicable, but the bound-state formation still takes place. To illustrate this phenomenon, one may represent the Tonks-Girardeau gas of N hard-core bosons by free fermions created by [formula], weakly coupled to a quantum impurity with the coordinate xi through the density-density interaction (:

[formula]

where mh is the mass of host particles, mi is the impurity mass and 0 < γ  ≪  1 is a dimensionless coupling constant.

Consider a state of the system with total momentum P > 0. If [formula], the low energy states are those where most of the momentum is carried by the impurity. Indeed, the impurity kinetic energy P2 / (2mi) is less than that of soft particle-hole excitations above the Fermi sea ~  vFP. In the opposite limit P > P0 the low energy states are those where hole excitations carry a significant fraction of the entire momentum P. The many-body ground state adiabatically connects between these two limits, signaling strong impurity-hole hybridization at P > P0. Indeed, consider a subspace of the full many-body space, which contains a single hole excitation with momentum 0 < k < 2kF in addition to the impurity with momentum P - k (this restriction is justified in the limit γ  ≪  1). The basis vectors of this subspace are

[formula]

The corresponding Schrödinger equation [formula] takes the form of the two-particle problem with the attractive delta-interaction (formally the attraction arises from anti-commuting the fermionic operators in the last term in Eq. ([\ref=eq:H])),

[formula]

where Eh(k) = vFk - k2 / (2mh) is the hole kinetic energy (we measure E relative to NEF / 3 + γρ2 / mh). This problem admits a unique bound-state solution, whose energy E = Eb(P) is found from the integral equation

[formula]

Its solution represents a non-perturbative correction to the bare impurity dispersion and is completely missed in the Boltzmann equation treatment. We plot Eb(P), along with the continuum of the scattering states, in Fig. [\ref=fig:fig1] for the case of light, η = mi / mh < 1, and heavy, η  >  1 impurity. The gap Δ between the bound-state and the continuum is found to be Δ / EF  ~  γ2η / (1 - η) for η  <  1 - γ  /  π2 and P0  ≤  P, while Δ / EF  ~   exp {  -  π2(η - 1) / ηγ} for η > 1 + γ  /  π2. For an almost equal mass case |1 - η| < γ  /  π2, one finds Δ / EF  ~  γ. We also note that for η = 1, integrability of Eq. ([\ref=eq:H]) allows access to the exact many-body ground state energy [\cite=Lamacraft] [formula]. Remarkably, as one may verify from Eq. ([\ref=eq:integral]), Eb(P  ~  kF) + γρ2 / mh = E0(P  ~  kF) for [formula], justifying our Hilbert space truncation.

The hard gap between the bound-state and the continuum is an artifact of restricting the particle in Eq. ([\ref=eq:psi]) to be created right at the Fermi momentum kF. Allowing for slight deviation [formula], introduces interaction of the bound-state with low energy, ~  vFp, excitations. It is known [\cite=Kam_Glazman] [\cite=Glazman] [\cite=Lamacraft] that such interaction transforms the bound-state into the quasi bound-state with the power-law (instead of the pole) correlation function. These low energy excitations are responsible for radiation losses and thus for linear mobility μ. They do not, however, destroy the quasi bound-state and associated Bloch oscillations at small applied force.

The Bloch oscillations are destroyed if a large enough force [formula] is applied to the impurity. The physics of this process is that of the Landau-Zener transition between the bound-state and the continuum at [formula]. One may thus estimate the crossover force as [formula], where [formula]. This leads to the following estimate for the maximal force, preserving (nearly) adiabatic bound-state dynamics

[formula]

while for |1 - η| < γ  /  π2, one finds [formula]. For [formula] both light and heavy impurities exhibit Bloch oscillations along with the drift [\cite=Schec1], whose velocity scales linearly with the force vD  =  μF.

In Refs. [\cite=Lamacraft] [\cite=Schec2] it was shown that for a heavy impurity away from the Tonks-Girardeau limit, there exists a phase transition at a critical value of the impurity mass: for mi < Mc the ground-state is a smooth function of momentum, while for mi > Mc the ground-state exhibits a cusp singularity at momenta P = (1 + 2n)kF for integer n (in the Tonks-Girardeau limit Mc  →    ∞  ). In the latter case the impurity "overshoots" the intersection points at P = (1 + 2n)kF and has to emit phonons to reach the ground state. This leads to an enhanced dissipation [\cite=Schec2] and thus to super-linear drift velocity

[formula]

where α  ≈  2K - 1 for γ  ≪  1 and K is the Luttinger parameter of the host.

Notice that in the Tonks-Girardeau limit the validity of the vD  =  μF response for η > 1 is limited to an exponentially small force ([\ref=eq:F_max]). This scale originates from the exponentially narrow region of momenta, where the bound-state exhibits the avoided crossing behavior, Fig. [\ref=fig:fig1](b). For [formula] the impurity overshoots the avoided crossing and follows the "wrong" parabola before emitting phonons and returning to the ground state. Thus, for [formula] one may apply Eq. ([\ref=eq:power]) with K = 1 - appropriate for the Tonks gas. This leads to [formula], in full agreement with Ref. [\cite=Lancaster]. An important extension of Ref. [\cite=Lancaster] is that the super-linear drift ([\ref=eq:power]) is to be expected for moderately heavy impurities mh < mi < Mc in an intermediate range of forces where the linear mobility vD  =  μF is inapplicable.
