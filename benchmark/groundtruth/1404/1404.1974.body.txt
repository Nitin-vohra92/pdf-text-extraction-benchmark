Abstract

We study the commutant of the vertex operator algebra L2(4,0) in the cyclic permutation orbifold model [formula] with τ = (1  2  3  4). It is shown that the commutant is isomorphic to a [formula]-orbifold model of a tensor product of two lattice type vertex operator algebras of rank one.

Introduction

Let [formula], 〈α,α〉  =  2 be a root lattice of type A1. It is well-known that the vertex operator algebra VA1 associated to the lattice A1 is isomorphic to a simple affine vertex operator algebra L2(1,0) of type [formula] with level 1. For an integer k  ≥  2, the cyclic sums of the weight one vectors in VA1 in the tensor product [formula] of k copies of VA1 generate a vertex operator subalgebra isomorphic to L2(k,0). The commutant M of L2(k,0) in [formula] has been studied well (see for example [\cite=JiangLin], [\cite=LamSakuma], [\cite=LamYamada]). Among other things the classification of irreducible modules for M and the rationality of M were established in [\cite=JiangLin].

Let τ be a cyclic permutation on the tensor components of [formula] of length k. Then τ is an automorphism of the vertex operator algebra [formula] and every element of L2(k,0) is fixed by τ. Thus τ induces an automorphism of M. Our main concern is the orbifold model Mτ of M by τ, that is, the set of fixed points of τ in M, which is the commutant of L2(k,0) in the orbifold model [formula].

The vertex operator algebra L2(k,0) contains a subalgebra T isomorphic to a vertex operator algebra associated to a rank one lattice generated by a square norm 2k element, which corresponds to a Cartan subalgebra of [formula]. The commutant of T in [formula] is a lattice type vertex operator algebra [formula]. On the other hand the commutant [formula] of T in L2(k,0) is called a parafermion vertex operator algebra of type [formula]. The parafermion vertex operator algebra [formula] has been studied both in mathematics and in physics from various points of view (see for example [\cite=ArakawaLamYamada], [\cite=DongLamYamada09], [\cite=DongLamWangYamada10], [\cite=DongLepowsky93]). We note that [formula] and [formula]. In fact, M is the commutant of [formula] in [formula].

If k  =  2, then M is isomorphic to the simple Virasoro vertex operator algebra [formula] of central charge [formula]. In this case τ acts trivially on M and Mτ coincides with M. The first nontrivial case, that is, the orbifold model Mτ for the case k = 3 was studied in [\cite=DongLamTanabeYamadaYokoyama]. It was shown that Mτ is a W3-algebra of central charge [formula]. Furthermore, the classification of irreducible modules for Mτ was obtained and their properties were discussed in detail. Those results were used for the study of the vertex operator algebra [formula] in [\cite=TanabeYamada].

In this paper we consider the orbifold model Mτ for the case k = 4. The study of Mτ should lead to a better understanding of the structure of [formula], for [formula] is contained in [formula].

Let [formula] be an orthogonal sum of three copies of [formula], where 〈α,α〉  =  2. The main idea is the use of an automorphism ρ of the vertex operator algebra VL studied in [\cite=DongLamYamada01], which maps VN onto V+L. Here N is a sublattice of L isomorphic to the sublattice [formula] of A41. It was shown in [\cite=DongLamYamada01] that [formula]; the commutant of [formula] in V+L, where γ  =  (α,α,α)∈L.

The cyclic permutation τ on the tensor components of [formula] is a lift of an isometry of the underlying lattice A41. We denote the isometry of A41 by the same symbol τ. The sublattice [formula] of A41 is invariant under τ. Hence we can discuss an isometry [formula] of N corresponding to the isometry τ of [formula] by the isomorphism [formula]. We extend [formula] to an isometry of L and consider its lift to an automorphism of the vertex operator algebra VL. We denote the automorphism by the same symbol [formula]. Let [formula] be the conjugate of [formula] by ρ so that [formula]. It turns out that [formula] can be expressed as [formula], where γ1 and γ2 are elements of L of square norm 12 and 4, respectively and G is a group of automorphisms of [formula] isomorphic to [formula].

It is known that the vertex operator algebra M is generated by the set of conformal vectors ωα of central charge [formula] associated to the positive roots α of type A3 (see [\cite=JiangLin], [\cite=LamSakuma]). However, it is difficult to describe the properties of the orbifold model Mτ in terms of those generators of M. By the result in this paper we can discuss [formula] instead of Mτ, which seems to be easy to treat.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we review basic materials of vertex operator algebras such as conformal vectors and the commutant of a vertex operator subalgebra. In Section 3 we discuss two kinds of automorphisms of a vertex operator algebra VL associated to a positive definite even lattice L, one is a lift of the - 1-isometry of the lattice L and the other is an exponential of the operator h(0) for [formula]. We also recall three automorphisms of a rank one lattice type vertex operator algebra [formula] studied in [\cite=DongLamYamada99], [\cite=DongLamYamada01] for 〈α,α〉  =  2. In Section 4 we introduce the commutant M of L2(4,0) in [formula] and its orbifold model Mτ by τ. Finally, in Section 5 we prove that Mτ is isomorphic to a [formula]-orbifold model of a tensor product of two rank one lattice type vertex operator algebras.

The automorphism ρ of the vertex operator algebra VL plays a key role in our argument. The use of ρ was suggested by Ching Hung Lam. The authors are grateful to him for the important advice.

Preliminaries

In this section we review some basic notions and notations for vertex operator algebras (see [\cite=MatsuoNagatomo99], [\cite=Kac98], [\cite=LepowskyLi04]). Let [formula] be a vertex operator algebra with the vacuum vector [formula] and the Virasoro vector ω. We denote ω by ωV also. The n-th product of u,v∈V will be written as u(n)v for [formula]. We often regard u(n) as a [formula]-linear endomorphism of V. Two vectors u and v in V are said to be mutually commutative if u(n)v = 0 for all [formula]. The eigenspace Vn for L0  =  ωV(1) of eigenvalue [formula] is finite dimensional. A vector in Vn is said to be of weight n.

A vertex operator subalgebra of V is a vertex subalgebra U equipped with a Virasoro vector ωU. When ωV  =  ωU, U is said to be full. For a pair of a vertex operator algebra V and its subalgebra U, the subspace

[formula]

becomes a vertex operator algebra with Virasoro vector [formula]. We call it the commutant of U in V. Actually, it is known that

[formula]

(see [\cite=FrenkelZhu92]). Hence the commutant of U in V depends only on the Virasoro vector of U.

A vector e∈V2 is called a conformal vector if Len = e(n + 1), [formula] give a representation for the Virasoro algebra on V of certain central charge. The Virasoro vector of a vertex operator subalgebra U of V is a conformal vector of V. Let e be a conformal vector in V. For any vertex operator subalgebra U with ωU = e, the commutant [formula] does not depend on U by [\eqref=conf101]. In such a case we may write [formula].

Let V be a vertex operator algebra and e1,e2 mutually commutative conformal vectors in V. Then [formula].

Let U be a vertex subalgebra generated by e1 and e2. Since e1 and e2 are mutually commutative, e1 + e2 is the Virasoro vector of U. Thus we have

[formula]

An automorphism of a vertex operator algebra V is a linear isomorphism of V preserving all n-th product, and fixing the vacuum vector [formula] and the Virasoro vector ωV. For a group G consisting of automorphisms of V, the subset

[formula]

is a full vertex operator subalgebra of V, which is called the orbifold model of V by G. When G = 〈τ〉 is a cyclic group, we denote VG by Vτ simply.

Let V be a vertex operator algebra and G an automorphism group of V. Let U a vertex operator subalgebra of V and assume that g(ωU) = ωU for any g∈G. Then the restriction g' of g∈G to [formula] gives rise to an automorphism of [formula]. In fact, for the automorphism group H = {g'|g∈G} of [formula], we have

[formula]

Lattice type vertex operator algebras and their automorphisms

In this section we discuss certain automorphisms of lattice type vertex operator algebras. Let VL be the vertex operator algebra constructed in [\cite=FLM] for a positive definite even lattice (L,〈  ,  〉) of rank d. As a vector space VL is isomorphic to a tensor product of the symmetric algebra [formula] and the twisted group algebra [formula] of L, where [formula]. In this paper we only consider the case where [formula] for any α∈L or L is an orthogonal sum of rank one lattices. In such a case the central extension L̂ of L studied in [\cite=FLM] splits and [formula] is canonically isomorphic to the ordinary group algebra [formula]. Thus we take [formula] in place of [formula] here. A standard basis of [formula] is denoted by {eα|α∈L} with multiplication eαeβ  =  eα  +  β. The vacuum vector of VL is [formula], and the Virasoro vector is given by where [formula] is an orthonormal basis of [formula]. Every eigenvalue for L0  =  ωVL(1) on VL is a nonnegative integer and the eigenspace (VL)n with eigenvalue n is finite dimensional.

For simplicity, we regard the sets L, [formula] and {eα|α∈L} as subsets of VL, respectively, under the identification

[formula]

for α∈L and [formula]. Then we have [formula] and

[formula]

In fact, the weight of eα is [formula] for α∈L.

We will need two kinds of automorphisms of VL. One is an involution θL given by a lift of the - 1-isometry of the lattice L. We have for β∈L. The set (VL)θL of fixed points of θL is also denoted by V+L. The other is an inner automorphism [formula] for [formula]. We have for β∈L. In particular, for [formula] and 0  ≠  α∈L. Since Ih1Ih2  =  Ih1 + h2 for [formula], the automorphism Ih is of finite order if and only if [formula] for some [formula]. By the definition of θL and Ih, we see that for any [formula]. Therefore,

[formula]

That is, IhθL is conjugate to θL in [formula].

Let [formula] be a rank one lattice with 〈α,α〉 = 2, which is the root lattice of type A1. In [\cite=DongLamYamada99], three involutions θ1, θ2 and σ of [formula] are considered. The involutions θ1 and θ2 are expressed as and σ is a unique extension of the involution of the Lie algebra [formula] given by

[formula]

where Eα  =  eα  +  e-  α and Fα  =  eα  -  e-  α. As automorphisms of [formula], we have

[formula]

Orbifold model Mτ

In this section we introduce an orbifold model Mτ. We use the notation XN to denote the root lattice of type XN. We also write XiN for an orthogonal sum of i copies of the root lattice XN.

For simplicity, we write L(k,0) for the simple affine vertex operator algebra L2(k,0) associated to [formula] of positive integer level k. It is well-known that L(1,0) is isomorphic to the lattice type vertex operator algebra VA1 associated to the root lattice of type A1. Thus we have natural isomorphisms

[formula]

of vertex operator algebras. Let τ be a cyclic permutation on [formula] defined by for ai∈L(1,0). In fact, τ is a lift of an isometry

[formula]

of the lattice

[formula]

with 〈αi,αj〉 = 2δi,j.

Set and consider a sublattice [formula] of A41. We note that [formula] and [formula] are mutually orthogonal and that [formula] modulo [formula]. Hence [formula] and as [formula]-modules. It follows that

Since τ leaves [formula] invariant, τ induces an automorphism of the vertex operator algebra [formula], which will be also denoted by τ. This automorphism is a lift of the restriction of the isometry τ [\eqref=eq:tau-A_1^4] of A41 to its sublattice [formula]:

[formula]

Since [formula] is contained in (VA41)τ, it follows from [\eqref=orbcoset] that

We next take two vectors in  (VA41)τ1. Then the set {E,H,F} generates a vertex operator subalgebra U of (VA41)τ isomorphic to L(4,0). We consider the commutant

We note that U contains [formula] as a vertex operator subalgebra. The commutant has been studied in [\cite=ArakawaLamYamada], [\cite=DongLamYamada09] and [\cite=DongLamWangYamada10]. The Virasoro vector of K0 is [formula]. Since ωK0 and [formula] are mutually commutative conformal vectors and since [formula], we see that

[formula]

by Proposition [\ref=prop102]. Since U is contained in (VA41)τ, we have

[formula]

Main results

In this section we show that Mτ is isomorphic to a [formula]-orbifold model of a tensor product of two lattice type vertex operator algebras of rank one. Following [\cite=DongLamYamada01], we study an isomorphism between the vertex operator algebras [formula] and V+A31. We remark that another isomorphism was considered in [\cite=DongLamYamada99] (see [\cite=DongLamYamada01]).

Throughout this section, let be an orthogonal sum of three copies of [formula], where 〈α,α〉  =  2. Set so that [formula] and 〈α(i),α(j)〉  =  2δi,j. The vertex operator algebra VL is isomorphic to the tensor product [formula] of three copies of [formula]. Hence the involution σ of [formula] defined in [\eqref=sigmainvolution] induces naturally an involution [formula] of VL. Let

[formula]

be a composite of [formula] and the inner automorphism [formula] of VL with respect to [formula] (see [\cite=DongLamYamada01]). We note that [formula]. By the definition of ρ, we have

Set

Then [formula] forms the set of simple roots of type A3. We consider the sublattice of L. It is known that [formula] is isomorphic to the sublattice [formula] of the lattice A41 [\eqref=eq:A_1^4] discussed in Section 4 by the correspondence

[formula]

This isomorphism between the lattices N and [formula] induces an isomorphism between the vertex operator algebras VN and [formula]. Thus we can think of the vertex operator subalgebras M and K0 of [formula] discussed in Section 4 as vertex operator subalgebras of VN.

We need the following facts in [\cite=DongLamYamada01].

(1) ρ(VN) = V+L.

(2) [formula].

(3) [formula].

The assertions (1) and (2) follow from [\cite=DongLamYamada01]. Then the assertion (3) follows from [\eqref=eqn1020].

Under the isomorphism [\eqref=equiv101] between N and [formula], the isometry τ [\eqref=eq:tau-sqrt2-A3] of the lattice [formula] corresponds to an isometry of the lattice N. This isometry of N is the restriction of an isometry [formula] of the lattice L of order 4 given by The isometry [formula] of L lifts to an automorphism of the vertex operator algebra VL of order 4, which is also denoted by [formula].

Actually, is a composite of t13 and [formula], where t13 denotes the transposition of the first component and the third one of the tensor product [formula]. By direct calculations, we have

Now we consider the conjugate τ' of [formula] by ρ [\eqref=eq:rho].

As automorphisms of VL, we have

[formula]

Using [\eqref=conj101], we can calculate as follows.

[formula]

Recall that γ  =  α(1)  +  α(2)  +  α(3). We set and consider [formula]. Since γ1, γ2 and γ are mutually orthogonal, we have [formula]. One can easily see that

[formula]

Hence we have a coset decomposition Since [formula], we have Therefore,

[formula]

(1) The eigenvalues for τ' on [formula] are ±  1.

(2) The eigenvalues for τ' on [formula] are [formula].

(3) [formula].

Recall that we regard L as a subset of VL. Under the canonical identification between VL and [formula], we have

[formula]

respectively. Then by Lemma [\ref=lemma002], we have Since [formula] is generated by the set {γ1,γ2,e±  γ1,Eγ2,Fγ2} consisting of eigenvectors for τ' whose eigenvalues are [formula], we have the assertion (1).

We note that [formula] is an irreducible [formula]-module and so it is generated by a nonzero vector [formula]. Since

[formula]

we have [formula]. Hence by (1), the assertion (2) holds.

The assertion (3) follows from (1), (2) and [\eqref=eq202].

Here we note that 〈γ1,γ1〉 = 12 and 〈γ2,γ2〉 = 4. Let Then by [\eqref=eq201] and [\eqref=eq2012], the restriction of τ' to [formula] coincides with the automorphism g. Hence [\eqref=eq:Comm-VA_1^3-V_gamma] and Lemma [\ref=lemma003] imply the following proposition.

Let L and τ' be as above. Then

Let M and τ be as in Section 4. Then we see that

[formula]

by the definition of τ', Theorem [\ref=theorem001] and Proposition [\ref=prop104], where

Let G  =  〈g,θ'〉 be a subgroup of [formula] generated by g and θ'. We note that

Let [formula] and τ a cyclic permutation of VA41 of length 4 as in Section 4. Let G be as above. Then Mτ is isomorphic to the orbifold model [formula].

Let By [\eqref=conj102], we have

[formula]

Let [formula] and [formula]. Then [formula] and the following corollary holds.

The vertex operator algebra Mτ is isomorphic to the orbifold model [formula].
