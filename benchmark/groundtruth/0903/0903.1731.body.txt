The XMM Cluster Survey: Galaxy Morphologies and the Color-Magnitude Relation in XMMXCS J2215.9 - 1738 at

Introduction

The galaxy populations of clusters are dominated by galaxies of early morphological type, ellipticals and S0s, which form a tight color-magnitude relation (CMR) or 'red sequence'. For decades, this relation was interpreted as evidence that the stars in early type galaxies in clusters are uniformly old, being formed at redshift zf  >  2, with the slope of the relation being primarily due to a mass-metallicity relation [\citep=Larson_1974] [\citep=Tinsley_1978] [\citep=Gallazzi_2006]. The alternative interpretation of the CMR as being predominantly an age sequence was conclusively ruled out by observations of clusters at [formula], which showed that the slope of the CMR evolves little with redshift [\citep=KodamaArimoto_1997].

A number of studies of clusters conducted with the Hubble Space Telescope have shown that the CMR of elliptical galaxies remains well established at progressively higher redshifts [\citep=Ellis_1997] [\citep=Stanford_1998] [\citep=vanDokkum_2000], at least up to [formula] [\citep=vanDokkumLynx_2001] [\citep=Blakeslee_2003] [\citep=MeiLynx_2006]. The only study to date of the CMR in a cluster at z = 1.4 is consistent with this picture [\citep=Lidman_2008]. Measurements of the intrinsic scatter about the CMR can be used to constrain the ages of the constituent stellar populations of cluster early type galaxies, and indicate that major epoch of star formation in clusters was completed at z  >  2 [\citep=Bower_1992] [\citep=Blakeslee_2003] [\citep=Mei_2009]. Studies of the fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies up to high redshift similarly indicate that the bulk of stellar populations in elliptical galaxies were formed at z  >  2 [\citep=vanDokkumStanford_2003] [\citep=Holden_2005] [\citep=Jorgensen_2006] [\citep=vanDokkumVanDerMarel_2007].

These observations are consistent with a simple formation scenario for elliptical galaxies, in which they formed the bulk of their stellar mass in a single event at high redshift, and evolved passively thereafter. However, the latest semi-analytic models of galaxy formation, constructed within the hierarchical formation paradigm, are also able to successfully reproduce the old ages of stellar populations in elliptical galaxies [\citep=DeLucia_2006] [\citep=Menci_2008].

Recent observations over a wide range in redshift in both clusters and the field have revealed that star formation appears to be completed earlier in higher mass galaxies than in low mass galaxies, a phenomenon dubbed 'downsizing' [\citep=Cowie_1996]. In color-magnitude diagrams of high redshift clusters, this effect manifests itself as a deficit of faint galaxies on the red sequence in comparison to clusters observed at lower redshift [\citep=DeLucia_2004] [\citep=DeLuciaCMR_2007] [\citep=Stott_2007], and may have an environmental dependence in the sense that the faint end of the CMR is populated at earlier times in denser regions, such as in the cluster cores, compared to low density regions such as groups [\citep=Tanaka_2005] [\citep=Tanaka_2008] [\citep=Gilbank_2008].

This could be explained qualitatively by a scenario in which the faint end of the red sequence is being built up by the transformation of star forming, spiral galaxies into passively evolving S0s as redshift increases. Up to z  ~  1, studies of magnitude-limited samples of cluster galaxies have revealed that the elliptical galaxy fraction within clusters is found to remain roughly constant, while the fraction of S0 galaxies decreases, with a corresponding increase in the fraction of spiral and irregular galaxies [\citep=Dressler_1997] [\citep=Smith_2005] [\citep=Postman_2005]. When considering stellar mass-limited samples, it has been found that the fraction of massive, early type galaxies as a whole remains roughly constant, at least up to z  ≈  0.8 [\citep=Holden_2006] [\citep=Holden_2007] [\citep=vanDerWel_2007]. This suggests that the much stronger evolution seen in magnitude-limited samples is dominated by fainter, lower mass (sub-M* in the galaxy stellar mass function) galaxies. It should be noted that at the current time the evidence for downsizing within the centers of rich clusters is still somewhat contentious ([\citealt=Andreon_2008]; ).

In this paper, we present a study of the galaxy morphologies and color-magnitude relation in XMMXCS J2215.9 - 1738 at z = 1.46 [\citep=Stanford_2006] [\citep=Hilton_2007], the most distant X-ray selected galaxy cluster currently known. To date, only five other spectroscopically confirmed clusters are known at z  >  1.3, XMMU J2235.3 - 2557 at z = 1.39, discovered serendipitously with XMM-Newton [\citep=Mullis_2005]; three clusters at z = 1.33 - 1.41 from the IRAC Shallow Cluster Survey [\citep=Eisenhardt_2008] [\citep=Stanford_2005]; and the z = 1.335 cluster J003550 - 431224, discovered by the Spitzer Adaptation of the Red-sequence Cluster Survey [\citep=Wilson_2008].

J2215.9 - 1738 was discovered as part of the ongoing optical follow up campaign to the XMM Cluster Survey [\citep=Romer_2001], which has the primary aim of constraining the cosmological parameters through measuring the evolution of the cluster mass function with redshift. Predictions for the expected cosmological constraints that are expected to be achieved by the full survey can be found in [\citet=Sahlen_2008]. J2215.9 - 1738 has X-ray luminosity LX  =  4.39+ 0.46- 0.37  ×  1044 ergs s- 1, temperature T  =  7.4+ 1.6- 1.1 keV [\citep=Stanford_2006], and velocity dispersion σv  =  580  ±  140 km s- 1 [\citep=Hilton_2007]. There is mild evidence that the cluster velocity distribution is bimodal, which, if confirmed by further spectroscopic observations, would indicate that the cluster is undergoing a merger close to the line of sight [\citep=Hilton_2007].http://www.xcs-home.org

The structure of this paper is as follows. We begin by describing the observations and data reduction in  [\ref=s_observationsDataReduction]. In  [\ref=s_analysis], we describe our photometric measurements, morphological classification, and photometric redshift selection of the cluster members. We present the morphological fractions, fits to the color-magnitude relation, and inferred ages for the stellar populations of the early type galaxies in  [\ref=s_results]. Finally, we discuss our findings in comparison with previous work in  [\ref=s_discussion].

We assume a concordance cosmology of Ωm = 0.3, ΩΛ = 0.7, and H0 = 70 km s- 1 Mpc- 1 throughout, where ΩΛ is the energy density associated with a cosmological constant.

Observations and data reduction

For our study of the galaxy populations of J2215.9-  1738, we use a combination of optical data in the i775 and z850 bands obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for Surveys [\citep=Ford_2003], and near infrared data in the J and Ks bands taken using the Multi-Object Infrared Camera and Spectrograph [\citep=Ichikawa_2006] on the 8.2 m Subaru telescope at the summit of Mauna Kea, Hawaii. As shown in Fig. [\ref=f_passbandsPlot], at the cluster redshift of z = 1.46 the optical data lies blueward of the 4000 Å break, and therefore near infrared data are essential to provide a color which is able to separate the cluster red sequence from bluer, star forming galaxies. The z850 - J color at the cluster redshift of z = 1.46 roughly corresponds to rest frame U - V, while z850 - Ks is roughly equivalent to rest frame U - z.

Fig. [\ref=f_RGBImage] presents a color-composite (z850, J, Ks) image of the cluster. It is apparent from Fig. [\ref=f_RGBImage] that J2215.9 - 1738 lacks an obvious Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG), in contrast with the only other similarly high redshift X-ray selected cluster currently known, XMMU J2235.3 - 2557 at z = 1.39 [\citep=Lidman_2008]. Similarly, the galaxy distribution is much less compact in J2215.9 - 1738 than in J2235.3 - 2557.

We now describe the observations and data reduction performed for each instrument in turn.

Hubble Space Telescope

J2215.9 - 1738 was observed using the ACS Wide Field Channel (WFC) as part of a program designed to place constraints on the dark energy through observations of high redshift Type Ia supernovae. Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained from the data archive at the Space Telescope Institute. STScI is operated by the association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc. under the NASA contract NAS 5-26555. The observations are associated with program 10496. The field of view of the ACS WFC is approximately [formula], and the pixel scale of the detectors is [formula] per pixel. A detailed description of the ACS observations is presented in [\citet=Dawson_2008]. A total of 3320 sec of exposure was obtained in i775 across 12 frames. In z850, 16935 sec of exposure was obtained in 64 frames. In both cases, the final stacked images were created using the MULTIDRIZZLE PyRAF task. http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/ ... ... pyraf/stsci_python

Subaru

J2215.9-  1738 was observed with MOIRCS in photometric conditions on UT 2007 August 08. The observations were carried out in service mode. The field of view of MOIRCS is [formula], which is imaged at a resolution of [formula] per pixel on to a pair of 2048  ×  2048 HAWAII-2 detector arrays. Unfortunately, one of the detector arrays was inoperable at the time our observations were carried out. Our observations were designed to place the target cluster at the center of the second, working detector array. We performed imaging in the J and Ks bands, using a 9-point circular dither pattern of radius 25[formula] to ensure good sky subtraction. We obtained a total of 1485 sec of integration in J, for an individual frame time of 165 seconds at each dither position. In the Ks band, the total integration time was 1242 sec, achieved by co-adding 3  ×  46 sec exposures at each dither position. The observations were obtained at airmass ≈  1.3. The seeing was excellent, at [formula] in both J and Ks.

The data were reduced using the MCSRED package for the IRAF environment in the standard manner: the individual dither frames were flat fielded, sky subtracted, corrected for distortion caused by the optical design of MOIRCS, and registered to a common pixel coordinate system. The final science images were created from the 3σ-clipped mean of the dither frames.IRAF is distributed by the National Optical Astronomy Observatories, which are operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation.

Analysis

Photometry

As most of our ACS data were obtained before UT 2006 July 04, we adopted AB photometric zeropoints in the i775 and z850 ACS bands of 25.678 and 24.867 respectively. After this date, the ACS photometric zeropoints changed due to a change in the temperature of CCDs: frames obtained after this change occurred were adjusted to match the above zeropoints. During the MOIRCS observations, we obtained imaging of several photometric standards from the UKIRT faint standards list. The zeropoints we determined in the J and Ks bands are 26.435±  0.007 and 25.900±  0.010 on the Vega system respectively. For the near infrared data we adopt conversions to the AB magnitude system [\citep=Oke_1974] of J(AB)  =  J(Vega) + 0.943 and Ks(AB)  =  Ks(Vega)  +  1.86 [\citep=TokunagaVacca_2005]. All magnitudes quoted throughout the rest of this paper are on the AB system, unless stated otherwise.see http://www.stsci.edu/hst/acs/analysis/zeropoints

To measure accurate colors for the galaxies in J2215.9-  1738, we need to perform measurements through a consistent set of photometric apertures. We used the SEXTRACTOR package [\citep=BertinArnouts_1996] in dual image mode to achieve this, where objects are detected and apertures are defined using the first image, while photometry is performed on the second image. We chose to use the MOIRCS Ks image as the detection image. As the ACS and MOIRCS imaging data have different angular and pixel resolution, some additional processing was required prior to performing the photometry.

Firstly, we trimmed the ACS and MOIRCS images to cover a common area of dimensions [formula], centered on the cluster X-ray position. This area encloses the overlapping ACS coverage from the individual dither frames, rejecting higher noise regions at the edges covered by fewer ACS pointings. We then scaled the MOIRCS images from their native pixel scale of 0.117[formula] per pixel to the ACS pixel scale of 0.05[formula] per pixel, interpolating using a 3rd order spline polynomial. The MOIRCS images were then registered to the ACS images to pixel accuracy. Finally, the ACS images were matched to the 0.5[formula] angular resolution of the MOIRCS images by convolution with a Gaussian filter with σ  =  4.0 pixels.

To estimate the photometric errors in each band, we constructed RMS images for use as weight images by SEXTRACTOR. For the MOIRCS images, we used the RMS images produced by the MCSRED data reduction package - these are simply the standard deviation at each pixel derived from the 9 individual dither frames. For the ACS images, the RMS images were constructed from the drizzled science images and the exposure time maps output by the MULTIDRIZZLE task, taking into account the photon statistics and the detector read noise. The drizzling process used to make the final ACS science images correlates the pixel-to-pixel noise, which, if ignored, would lead to underestimated photometric errors. We corrected for this effect following the methodology outlined in the Appendix of [\citet=Casertano_2000].

The effect of the interpolation operations on the photometry from the MOIRCS images was tested by cross matching catalogs constructed at the native MOIRCS pixel scale, with catalogs made from the images resampled to match the ACS pixel scale. Objects were matched between each catalog within a 0.5[formula] radius and the [formula] aperture magnitudes were compared. We found that the median magnitude difference between the two catalogs was ≈  0.001 for J,Ks  <  24. We decided to treat the scatter between the catalogs as an additional source of uncertainty: we fitted an exponential model to the scatter as a function of magnitude, applied this model to the J,Ks aperture magnitudes in the catalog constructed at the ACS pixel resolution, and added the results in quadrature to the photometric errors output by SEXTRACTOR. The increase in the J and Ks aperture magnitude uncertainties resulting from this procedure is small,   <  0.04 mag. at J,Ks  <  24.

To classify objects as stars and galaxies, we constructed a second set of catalogs in the manner described above, with the exception that the ACS images were not matched to the 0.5[formula] resolution of the MOIRCS images, and instead were read into SEXTRACTOR at their native [formula] angular resolution. We used the neural-network based star-galaxy classification provided by SEXTRACTOR (CLASS_STAR) to determine the object types. We classify all objects with CLASS_STAR< 0.9 as measured in the z850 image as galaxies; all other objects are assumed to be stars. We chose to carry out the classification in the z850 band, because the z850 image is significantly deeper than the i775 image, reaching an approximate 5σ limiting magnitude of ≈  26.0 for galaxies, compared to ≈  25.1 for the i775 image (estimated from the photometric uncertainties).

We corrected the photometry for the effect of Galactic extinction using the dust maps and software of . In all that follows, SEXTRACTOR MAG_AUTO magnitudes were adopted as measurements of total galaxy magnitudes, and colors were measured in 1.0[formula] diameter circular apertures, equal to twice the seeing of the MOIRCS images. This is comparable to the typical diameter of the cluster member galaxies.

Note that we do not attempt to correct the photometry of objects blended as a consequence of performing the object detection in the Ks-band. Only a small number of such objects are seen, perhaps due to the galaxy distribution in J2215.9 - 1738 being less compact than other similarly high redshift clusters, as noted in  [\ref=s_observationsDataReduction] above. As shown in  [\ref=s_resultsMorphologies], this has a negligible effect on our results.

Morphologies

Morphological classification was performed on all 201 galaxies with magnitudes brighter than z850  ≤  24, by visual inspection of the z850-band imaging data. This is [formula] magnitudes brighter than the approximate 5σ magnitude limit of the z850-band image. Due to the high redshift of J2215.9 - 1738, the morphological classification was carried out in the rest frame U-band, rather than the traditional B-band [\citep=Postman_2005]. Furthermore, the typical diameter of the cluster member galaxies in the ACS imaging is <  20 pixels, making detailed morphological classification on the traditional Hubble system difficult. For these reasons, we chose to place the galaxies into four broad morphological bins: elliptical (E; corresponding to E1-  E9 on the traditional Hubble system), lenticular (S0), spiral (Sp; Sa-  Sd, SBa-  SBd on the traditional Hubble system) or irregular (Irr).

The classification was carried out on the complete sample by a team of five classifiers (CAC, MH, BH, SAS, JPS). Each galaxy in the sample was examined by means of a 150 pixel on a side postage stamp image, centered on the galaxy in question. No further information on the galaxy to be classified (e.g., position, redshift, color or magnitude) was provided during the classification process, in order to ensure that the classification was determined strictly on the evidence of the imaging data alone, guarding against potential biases. The same training set of galaxy images, constructed from the [\citet=Postman_2005] study of galaxy morphologies in 0.8  <  z  <  1.3 clusters, was provided to each classifier.

We found there was generally good agreement on the morphological classification of the individual galaxies among the five classifiers: majority agreement (i.e. >  50% of the votes cast by the classifiers were for a particular morphology) was reached for 85% of the sample. Agreement by >  2 / 3 of the classifiers was reached for 67% of the sample. We estimated the RMS scatter between the morphological fractions determined by each classifier and adopted this as our estimate of the morphological classification error, used in  [\ref=s_resultsMorphologies] below. For the elliptical galaxy fraction, we measure a scatter of σfE  =  0.11; for the S0 galaxy fraction, we obtain σfS0  =  0.05; and for the late type galaxy fraction (Sp+Irr), we obtain σfSp + Irr  =  0.11. The uncertainty in the early type galaxy fraction (E+S0) is σfE + S0  =  0.11. These uncertainties are comparable in size to those obtained by [\citet=Postman_2005].

Note that in this study we have not taken into account the potential impact of surface brightness dimming, the effect of which can impair the ability to distinguish between, e.g. ellipticals/S0s, and S0/Sa galaxies. [\citet=Postman_2005] conducted simulations in order to quantify the size of this effect in their ACS study of the morphology-density relation in z  ~  1 clusters, and found that the effect of surface brightness dimming was successfully mitigated by their chosen exposure times (typically ≈  12000 sec in z850). We therefore expect that the impact of surface brightness dimming on our results is alleviated to some extent by our long exposure time, ≈  40% longer than the typical exposure time used by [\citealt=Postman_2005], and by the broad morphological bins we have adopted.

Photometric redshifts

Secure spectroscopic redshifts have been obtained for a total of 58 galaxies within the [formula] field covered by the ACS and MOIRCS observations. The majority of these redshifts come from observations of J2215.9 - 1738 using the DEep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph [\citep=Faber_2003] on the 10m Keck II telescope, and the Focal Reducer and Low Dispersion Spectrograph [\citep=Appenzeller_1998] on the 8m Very Large Telescope (VLT), and are described in [\citet=Hilton_2007]. Observations through a further three DEIMOS slit masks have been obtained subsequent to this work; one being observed in September 2007, and two in September 2008. Details of the 2007 and 2008 Keck observations will be presented in S. A. Stanford et al. (2009, in preparation). Of the 58 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts, 24 are cluster members, and so we chose to use the available four band (i775, z850, J, Ks) photometry to determine cluster membership using photometric redshifts, for all galaxies in the Ks-selected catalog described in  [\ref=s_analysisPhotometry] above.

We used the spectral template fitting code EAZY to estimate photometric redshifts. EAZY has been designed to be especially useful in cases where spectroscopic redshifts are only available for a biased subset of galaxies. This is the case for our dataset, as color, magnitude criteria were used to preferentially select likely cluster members as spectroscopic targets. Furthermore, the limited size of our spectroscopic subsample makes the use of 'training set'-type techniques inappropriate, such as, e.g. neural-network based redshift estimates [\citep=Collister_2004], or iterative correction of empirical spectral templates [\citep=Feldmann_2006]. We used the default set of five spectral templates included with EAZY, which is constructed by applying the non-negative matrix factorization technique of [\citet=Blanton_2007] to a set of 3,000 stellar population models from the PEGASE library [\citep=Fioc_1997], and a catalog of synthetic galaxy photometry derived from the semi-analytic simulation of [\citet=DeLucia_2007]. We chose to use the option within EAZY to fit a linear combination of all of the templates to our galaxy catalog, over a redshift range of 0  <  z  <  4, using the [formula] aperture magnitudes as the input photometry. Finally, we chose to use the K - magnitude based Bayesian redshift prior included with EAZY, which is derived from the synthetic, semi-analytic model galaxy photometry used to define the template set, and adopted the maximum likelihood redshift estimate after the application of this prior as the redshift estimate zp for each galaxy.

We checked the accuracy of the photometric redshift estimates produced by EAZY by comparison with the spectroscopic subsample. Given the wavelength coverage of our available photometric bands, we would not expect to obtain reliable photometric redshifts for galaxies with redshifts below z  <  1, as photometric redshift techniques rely on identifying strong spectral breaks in order to assign redshift estimates, and the i775-band only drops below 4000 Å in the rest frame at [formula]. We therefore performed the check on the photometric redshift accuracy on the 36 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts zs  >  1. We found that the typical scatter σδz in the photometric redshift residuals δz  =  (zs  -  zp)  /  (1  +  zs) was σδz  =  0.039, where σδz was estimated using a biweight scale estimator [\citep=Beers_1990], which is robust to outliers. The photometric redshifts appear to be almost unbiased in this redshift range, as the median δz  =   + 0.015; however, a small number of objects have overestimated photometric redshifts, as can be seen from the negative tail of the distribution shown in Fig. [\ref=f_zpzsHistogram].

A cut of |zp  -  zc|  <  2  ×  σδz(1 + zc) was used to define cluster membership, where zc is the cluster redshift of z = 1.46 - i.e. galaxies with 1.27  <  zp  <  1.65 were considered to be members of the cluster. We used the spectroscopic subsample to assess the amount of contamination from galaxies with spurious photometric redshifts (i.e. with zs  <  1.27, zs  >  1.65); contamination from interlopers, defined as galaxies with velocities outside of the range ±  3σv around the cluster redshift, where σv is the line of sight velocity dispersion measured in [\citet=Hilton_2007] (i.e. zs  >  1.46 + 0.015 or zs  <  1.46 - 0.015, but 1.27  <  zs  <  1.65); and missing spectroscopically identified members (i.e. with zp  <  1.27, zp  >  1.65 and 1.445  <  zs  <  1.475).

Initially, using only the cut in zp to define membership, a total of 13 galaxies (22% of the spectroscopic subsample) were identified as having spurious photometric redshifts, all with zs  <  1. However, galaxies with unreliable photometric redshift estimates have flat or multi-modal posterior redshift probability distributions, and can be easily identified by their pΔz value [\citep=Benitez_2000], which is the fraction of the integrated probability that lies within ±  Δz of the photometric redshift estimate zp (in the case of EAZY, Δz = 0.2). Galaxies with lower pΔz values have broader redshift probability distributions, and correspondingly less reliable photometric redshift estimates. Applying a cut of pΔz  >  0.9 reduces the number of spurious photometric redshifts in the spectroscopic subsample to two galaxies (3.4% of the spectroscopic subsample). We therefore chose to use this cut in pΔz in all that follows. A more conservative cut of pΔz  >  0.95 reduces the number of galaxies with spurious photometric redshifts to just a single galaxy, but this comes at the cost of a smaller sample size and increased error bars on the derived color-magnitude relation parameters (see  [\ref=s_resultsCMRs]).

The number of spectroscopically confirmed non cluster members contaminating the photometrically selected sample was found to be three (10.3% of the sample). However, four spectroscopically confirmed cluster members were missed by the photometric redshift selection (16.7% of the sample of 24 confirmed cluster members). Using a broader cut in zp than we have applied naturally reduces the fraction of missed spectroscopic members, but at the cost of significantly increasing the contamination from spectroscopically confirmed interlopers. We show in  [\ref=s_resultsMorphologies] and  [\ref=s_resultsCMRs] that our measurements are robust to reasonable changes of the parameters governing the photometric redshift selection.

We further refined our photometric membership selection by excluding from the sample all galaxies with Ks-band magnitudes brighter than the BCG, i.e. Ks  <  20.57. Although J2215.9 - 1738 lacks an obvious BCG, it possesses several candidates that are of similar brightness [\citep=Collins_2009], and this additional cut helps by removing seven bright, blue (z850 - J  <  1.0), lower redshift galaxies from the sample. These objects are probably at z  ≈  1.3, as indicated from their photometric redshifts, and one of these objects is a known interloper with spectroscopic redshift zs = 1.301. Finally, we removed from the sample all known interlopers with spectroscopic redshifts, and added back in the four spectroscopically confirmed members missed by the photometric redshift selection.

The final sample of photometrically selected members within the ACS/MOIRCS imaging area contains 64 galaxies. The colors, magnitudes, spectroscopic and photometric redshifts, and morphologies of the sample are recorded in Table [\ref=t_galaxyPhotometry].

Results

Morphologies

Fig. [\ref=f_morphologies] shows postage stamp images of all the galaxies with morphological classifications (i.e., all galaxies with z850  ≤  24), located within 0.75 Mpc of the cluster X-ray position, and selected as cluster members using the photometric criteria described in  [\ref=s_photoZs] above. In addition to the z850-band data from which the morphology of each object was determined, we also show a corresponding postage stamp taken from the Ks-band image that was used to perform the object detection (see  [\ref=s_analysisPhotometry]). Only four objects in this sample were found to be blended in the Ks-selected catalog - these are IDs 824, 610, 696 and 1047, and are noted with a pair of morphologies in Fig. [\ref=f_morphologies] and Table. [\ref=t_galaxyPhotometry].

Within a radius of 0.5 Mpc of the cluster X-ray position, there are a total of 39 galaxies with morphological classifications. The fraction of elliptical galaxies in this subsample is fE  =  0.54  ±  0.17; the fraction of lenticular galaxies is fS0  =  0.08  ±  0.07; and the fraction of late type galaxies is fSp + Irr  =  0.38  ±  0.15. The combined fraction of early type galaxies is fE + S0  =  0.62  ±  0.17.

In calculating the errors on the morphological fractions quoted above, we add in quadrature the classification error (see  [\ref=s_analysisMorphologies] above), the Poisson uncertainty, and the uncertainty in cluster membership due to the photometric redshift selection. To account for this latter effect, we perform 1000 Monte-Carlo simulations in which the photometric redshift of every galaxy is replaced by a random variate drawn from its photometric redshift probability distribution, as output by EAZY, and apply the algorithm described in  [\ref=s_photoZs] to select cluster members. We find that the dominant source of error is the classification error; the photometric redshift selection increases the size of the uncertainties by at most ≈   4% for a given morphological bin.

To further check that the results are robust to the choice of parameters used to define the photometric redshift selection, we also calculated the morphological fractions for different photometric redshift cuts. For a more conservative choice of pΔz  >  0.95, we obtain consistent results of fE  =  0.56  ±  0.17; fS0  =  0.06  ±  0.07; and fSp + Irr  =  0.38  ±  0.16, for a sample of 34 galaxies within a radius of 0.5 Mpc. Similarly, for a more stringent photometric redshift cut of 1.36  <  zp  <  1.56 with pΔz  >  0.9, we obtain fE  =  0.55  ±  0.18; fS0  =  0.06  ±  0.07; and fSp + Irr  =  0.39  ±  0.16, for a sample of 31 galaxies within the same selection radius. Considering only the 19 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts located within 0.5 Mpc of the cluster X-ray position, we obtain results consistent with those above, although with larger uncertainties. For this sample we find fE  =  0.58  ±  0.21; fS0  =  0.05  ±  0.07; and fSp + Irr  =  0.37  ±  0.18.

Given the large uncertainties, we are unable to examine the variation of the morphological fraction with radius. For example, extending the radius within which the morphological fractions are calculated to 0.75 Mpc does not change our results, as it only increases the sample size by a further three galaxies.

The object identified as the Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG) in J2215.9 - 1738, ID 688, has a clear S0 morphology as seen in Fig. [\ref=f_morphologies]. It is the brightest cluster member in the Ks-band (although there are in fact several other candidates of similar brightness), and has a spectrum consistent with a Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) template [\citep=Hilton_2007]. However, it lies ≈  300 kpc away from the cluster X-ray position. Although this would be unusual for clusters at low redshift, we note that the two brightest members of the z = 1.10 cluster RDCS J0910 + 5422 also have S0 morphologies, and furthermore, are located at clustercentric distances >  300 kpc [\citep=MeiRDCS_2006]. Therefore it is possible that J2215.9 - 1738 is not untypical of clusters at this epoch in this regard, given the small number of objects currently known at z  >  1. A comparison of the stellar masses of BCGs in a sample of z > 1 clusters, including J2215.9 - 1738, with the latest semi-analytic models of galaxy formation is presented in [\citet=Collins_2009].

Color-magnitude diagrams

We present the z850 - J and z850 - Ks color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) with fitted color-magnitude relations ( [\ref=s_resultsCMRs], below) in Fig. [\ref=f_zJCMD] and Fig. [\ref=f_zKCMD] respectively. Panel (a) of each figure shows all galaxies in the combined ACS/MOIRCS imaging area; panel (b) shows only members selected according to the photometric criteria described in  [\ref=s_photoZs] above. In each of these plots we show the approximate 5σ limiting magnitude for galaxies as a blue vertical dashed line (estimated from the size of the photometric errors); the corresponding 5σ-limit in color as a diagonal dashed blue line; and the approximate limit of the morphological classification caused by the z850  <  24 limit (see  [\ref=s_analysisMorphologies] above) as a diagonal dashed green line.

Along the top axis of each plot, we show the magnitude relative to the expected characteristic magnitude (M*; labelled as J* or K*s appropriately for each band in the plots) of the galaxy luminosity function at z = 1.46. The value of M* was estimated by passively evolving the value of K* found for clusters at z = 0.9 by [\citet=DePropris_1999] to z = 1.46, transformed to the passbands used in this paper. The evolution correction was performed by adopting a [\citet=BruzualCharlot_2003] single burst of star formation model, beginning at redshift zf = 3, decaying exponentially with characteristic time scale τ  =  0.1 Gyr, with solar metallicity, and [\citet=Salpeter_1955] Initial Mass Function (IMF). This model acceptably reproduces the observed evolution of K* over the redshift range 0.1  <  z  <  0.9 for the data in [\citet=DePropris_1999].

It is immediately apparent from Figs. [\ref=f_zJCMD] and [\ref=f_zKCMD] that the bright end of the color-magnitude relation in J2215.9 - 1738 is unpopulated: the brightest galaxies have Ks  ≈  20.6, approximately as bright as the expected value of M*. In contrast, the only other z > 1.3 X-ray selected cluster currently known, XMMU J2235.3 - 2557 at z = 1.39, has four spectroscopically confirmed members with Ks magnitudes in the range 18.9  <  Ks(AB)  <  20.6, within a 0.2 Mpc radius of the cluster center [\citep=Lidman_2008]. This corresponds to a difference in absolute magnitude of ~  1.5 mag between the BCGs [\citep=Collins_2009], neglecting the correction for passive evolution, as the difference in lookback time between the two clusters is only 0.2 Gyr.

Given the small number of systems observed to date at such high redshifts, it is unclear which of these objects is more typical of the general cluster population at this epoch. We note that the brightest galaxies in the compact cluster associated with the z = 1.51 galaxy GDDS-12-5859 have similar K-band magnitudes to the brightest members of J2215.9 - 1738 [\citep=McCarthy_2007]. However, further spectroscopic observations of this object are required to confirm its nature as a gravitationally bound system at z = 1.5.

Inspection of Figs. [\ref=f_zJCMD] and [\ref=f_zKCMD] shows that limiting the CMR fitting to a purely morphologically selected sample of E+S0 galaxies would restrict the total magnitude range in comparison to the magnitude limit of the complete sample. We therefore chose to perform the analysis on two samples - a morphologically selected sample of E+S0 galaxies (hereafter referred to as the 'morphologically selected sample'), and a sample defined without this restriction, spanning a larger magnitude range (hereafter referred to as the 'photometrically selected sample'). In both cases, we only include galaxies that pass the photometric membership selection criteria described in  [\ref=s_photoZs] above, to reduce the contamination from non-cluster member galaxies significantly. For the photometrically selected sample, we applied an additional color cut of 0.8  <  z850 - J  <  1.6, 1.5  <  z850 - Ks  <  3.0 as appropriate for the CMR being fitted, in order to avoid biasing the fits by the inclusion of a handful of faint galaxies much bluer than the red sequence.

An additional benefit of performing the analysis on a sample not selected on the basis of morphology is to examine the sensitivity of the results to the morphological classification. Systematic misclassification of some galaxies, for example face-on S0s as ellipticals, or flattened late type galaxies as S0s, would increase the apparent scatter about the CMR and result in the inference of younger galaxy ages [\citep=Mei_2009].

Color-magnitude relations

The color-magnitude relations were fitted to the color-magnitude data for each sample, defined in  [\ref=s_resultsCMDs] above, using a robust biweight linear least squares method. We estimated the errors on the fits in a Monte-Carlo fashion: we generated 1,000 realizations of the data, replacing the color of each galaxy with a random variate, assuming that the color errors have a Gaussian distribution, and fitted the CMR for each of these simulated datasets. The 1σ errors in the slope and intercept of the measured CMR were taken to be the standard deviations of the slopes and intercepts measured for the 1,000 simulated datasets.

For the morphologically selected sample of early type (E+S0) galaxies, we obtained the following relations:

[formula]

[formula]

For the photometrically selected sample, we obtained similar results:

[formula]

[formula]

Both the slopes and intercepts measured for the morphologically and photometrically selected samples agree at better than < 2σ for both the fits to the z850 - J and z850 - Ks CMRs, with the agreement being slightly better between the two samples in z850 - J. The uncertainties on the CMR slopes and intercepts are relatively large, due to the large scatter about the CMRs that can be seen in Figs. [\ref=f_zJCMD] and [\ref=f_zKCMD].

As Figs. [\ref=f_zJCMD] and [\ref=f_zKCMD] show, there are only ten spectroscopically confirmed members with early type morphologies located within 0.5 Mpc of the cluster X-ray position with J  <  22.5. We found that fitting the CMR for this purely spectroscopically selected sample gave significantly worse constraints on the CMR than the samples supplemented with photometric redshifts; for example, the slope of the z850 - J CMR is found to be - 0.262  ±  0.127. This is driven by one object (ID 526), which has a clear elliptical morphology (see Fig. [\ref=f_morphologies]), but is significantly bluer than the other spectroscopically selected early type galaxies. For this reason, we do not consider the purely spectroscopically selected galaxy sample further in this paper.

The observed scatter about the CMR was measured using a biweight scale estimate of the color residuals, with the error being estimated from 1,000 bootstrap samples. The intrinsic scatter σint in the CMR was estimated by subtracting in quadrature the RMS of the color errors of the galaxy sample to which the CMR was fitted. For the morphologically selected sample of early type (E+S0) galaxies, we measured σint(z850 - J)  =  0.123  ±  0.049, and σint(z850 - Ks)  =  0.173  ±  0.052. For the photometrically selected sample, we found σint(z850 - J)  =  0.118  ±  0.034, and σint(z850 - Ks)  =  0.237  ±  0.037. The measurements of intrinsic scatter are therefore in excellent agreement, at better than <  1σ, between the morphologically and photometrically selected samples. This suggests that systematic morphological classification errors of the type described in  [\ref=s_resultsCMDs] are not a problem at the level of precision achieveable with our galaxy sample.

We examined the dependence of our results on the photometric redshift selection in a number of ways. Adopting a conservative cut of pΔz  >  0.95, we found no significant differences with the results reported above: the differences between the CMR slope and intercept values in each band and for each sample are significant at the <  2σ level. Restricting the photometric redshift selection to only galaxies with zp = 1.46  ±  0.1, with pΔz  >  0.9, we find likewise. In all cases the measurements of intrinsic scatter are robust to the changes in the CMR fit parameters; we find that the differences across all samples and in all bands are significant at the < 1σ level.

As a final check on the robustness of the results to the photometric redshift selection, we performed 500 Monte-Carlo simulations in which, in addition to the photometry of each object in the catalog being randomized appropriately according to the size of the photometric errors, the photometric redshifts were also re-estimated using EAZY, and the algorithm used to select cluster members described in  [\ref=s_photoZs] was applied. For each of these simulations, the CMR fit parameters and scatter measurements were performed in the manner described above. Again, we found no significant differences from the above results, with the mean slope and intercept of the Monte-Carlo simulations being within < 2σ of the results for both the photometrically and morphologically selected samples in both z850 - J and z850 - Ks, and the internal scatter measurements being in agreement across all samples at better than the < 1σ level.

Table [\ref=t_fitResults] presents a summary of the measured fit parameters for the z850 - J and z850 - Ks CMRs, for both the morphologically and photometrically selected samples.

Inferred ages

The intrinsic scatter about the CMR can be used to estimate the major epoch of star formation for early type galaxies, given the assumption of a particular stellar population model and that the CMR is predominantly a sequence in metallicity and not age [\citep=Bower_1992]. This latter assumption was proven to be sound by observations of the CMR in distant clusters [\citep=KodamaArimoto_1997]. In actual fact, recent observations have shown that the CMR is primarily a sequence in stellar mass, in that the brightest galaxies tend to be more massive, metal rich and older than the galaxies at the faint end of the CMR, with the scatter in the CMR at the faint end being primarily due to differences in age [\citep=Gallazzi_2006].

We modelled the CMR scatter in the manner described by [\citet=Bower_1992]. We assumed as our baseline galaxy model a composite stellar population (CSP) of solar metallicity, with [\citet=Salpeter_1955] Initial Mass Function (IMF), formed in a single burst of star formation, decaying exponentially with characteristic time scale τ  =  0.1 Gyr. To check the dependence of our results on the stellar models, we used CSPs derived from [\citet=BruzualCharlot_2003], and [\citet=Maraston_2005]. One major difference between these two families of models is that the treatment of thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) stars is different, with the M05 models being shown to infer younger ages for galaxies in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (UDF) in comparison to the BC03 models [\citep=Maraston_2006].

We estimate the expected CMR scatter in the following way for each combination of CSP model and photometric bands. We assume that galaxies are born in a single burst of star formation at a time tbirth between the epoch of recombination and time tend, where the value of tend is varied in steps between zero and the epoch at which the cluster is observed (i.e., up to a maximum of tz  ≈  4.3 Gyr in our adopted cosmology). For each value of tend, we construct a sample of 10,000 simulated galaxies with ages assigned randomly from a uniform distribution with range 0  <  tbirth  <  tend, and estimate the scatter in the color distributions using a biweight scale estimate. The value of tend corresponding to the observed intrinsic CMR scatter is then used to infer estimates of the minimum and mean luminosity weighted galaxy age assuming a particular CSP.

Fig. [\ref=f_scatterFits] shows the expected intrinsic scatter σint around the CMR for the BC03 (red) and M05 (blue) models as a function of minimum age (dashed lines) or mean luminosity weighted age (solid lines) for the morphologically selected sample. Adopting the BC03 model, the measured intrinsic scatter around the z850 - J CMR indicates that the minimum age of the stellar populations of the red sequence galaxies in J2215.9 - 1738 is >  1.3  ±  0.8 Gyr (corresponding to a minimum redshift of formation of zf  >  2.1+ 0.7- 0.5). The corresponding mean luminosity weighted age is [formula] Gyr (i.e., [formula]). The ages inferred from the M05 model are younger; the minimum age being >  0.7  ±  1.6 Gyr (zf  >  1.8+ 1.4- 0.6), and the mean luminosity weighted age being [formula] Gyr ([formula]). However, the difference between the results for the two different models is not statistically significant.

In z850 - Ks, the minimum age is >  1.6  ±  0.3 Gyr (zf  >  2.4+ 0.3- 0.3), and the mean luminosity weighted age is [formula] Gyr ([formula]), assuming the BC03 model. This is in excellent agreement with the age inferred from the scatter about the z850 - J CMR, though of course the colors are not completely independent. For the M05 model, we again find lower ages: the minimum age is >  0.5  ±  1.2 Gyr (zf  >  1.7+ 0.8- 0.5), and the mean luminosity weighted age is [formula] Gyr ([formula]).

It is interesting to note that the measured scatter about the z850 - Ks CMR is near the limit of the allowed scatter in the M05 model (see Fig. [\ref=f_scatterFits]), although the uncertainty in the measurement is large. In fact, in the case of the photometrically selected sample, the measured scatter is larger than the maximum scatter expected in the M05 model. This could be a consequence of the greater weight given to TP-AGB stars in the M05 models relative to the BC03 models, which begins to have a significant effect at the I-band and redder wavelengths [\citep=Maraston_2005]. The observed Ks-band samples the rest frame z-band at the redshift of the cluster.

As the measurements of the intrinsic scatter in z850 - J and z850 - Ks are consistent between the morphologically and photometrically selected samples (see  [\ref=s_resultsCMRs] above), the inferred ages derived from the photometrically selected sample are consistent with those quoted above; however, the uncertainties are typically ≈  30 - 50% smaller due to the increased sample size. We provide a summary of these results in Table [\ref=t_ages].

Dwarf-giant ratio

Some studies of clusters at high redshift have revealed a deficit in the number of faint red sequence galaxies in comparison to observations of clusters at low redshift [\citep=DeLucia_2004] [\citep=DeLuciaCMR_2007] [\citep=Stott_2007]. This has been attributed to 'downsizing', where star formation is observed to have terminated at earlier epochs in more massive galaxies [\citep=Cowie_1996]. In the case of J2215.9 - 1738, Figs. [\ref=f_zJCMD] and [\ref=f_zKCMD] show an apparent paucity of galaxies on the red sequence at faint magnitudes (J  >  23.5), which may be indicative of this phenomenon.

We quantify this deficit using the Dwarf-to-Giant Ratio (DGR). Following [\citet=DeLuciaCMR_2007], we define giants as galaxies with absolute V-band magnitudes brighter than MV(Vega)  =   - 20, and dwarfs as galaxies fainter than this limit, but brighter than MV  =  (Vega)  =   - 18.2. These limits correspond to values at z = 0 after correction for the effect of passive evolution. In performing the passive evolution correction, we adopt the same [\citet=BruzualCharlot_2003] simple stellar population model as used by [\citet=DeLuciaCMR_2007], with solar metallicity, [\citet=Chabrier_2003] IMF, and formation redshift zf  =  3. The dividing magnitude between dwarfs and giants is equivalent to J(AB)  ≈  22.7 in the observed frame of J2215.9 - 1738 after this correction is applied, and the corresponding faint magnitude limit is J(AB)  ≈  24.5 (see  [\ref=s_discussionU-VScatter] below for details of the adopted conversion between V and J magnitudes). Thus, the faint magnitude limit is ≈  0.1 mag. fainter than the 5σ limiting magnitude of our observations, and so the limits that we obtain on the DGR may be slightly underestimated in comparison to [\citet=DeLuciaCMR_2007].

We estimated the DGR using the sample of photometrically selected cluster members defined in  [\ref=s_photoZs] and listed in Table [\ref=t_galaxyPhotometry]. Following [\citet=DeLuciaCMR_2007], using all of the members within r  <  0.5R200 (R200  ≈  0.6 Mpc for J2215.9 - 1738; [\citealt=Hilton_2007]), we find that the DGR = 0.50  ±  0.21. In estimating the DGR of galaxies on the red sequence, we only consider the z850 - J CMR, as unlike the z850 - Ks CMR, it is well suited to comparison with other studies at low redshift. Applying a color cut of [formula] mag. around the fit to the z850 - J CMR derived from the morphologically selected sample, we find that the red sequence DGR  =  0.32  ±  0.18. The uncertainties are estimated assuming Poissonian errors, added in quadrature to the uncertainty due to the photometric redshift selection, calculated using the full EAZY photometric redshift probability distribution for each galaxy by the same technique described in  [\ref=s_resultsMorphologies] above. The uncertainty due to the photometric redshift selection typically increases the size of the error bars on the DGR measurements by ≈  12%.

We checked the sensitivity of these results to the parameters governing the photometric redshift selection. Restricting the membership selection to galaxies with pΔz > 0.95 or 1.36  <  zp  <  1.56 does not affect these results significantly, the DGR measurements in each case being well within < 1σ of the above results.

Extending the selection radius to r  <  0.75 Mpc does not change these results significantly: we estimate that the DGR = 0.65  ±  0.22 if all the photometrically selected members are included; if we include only those members within ±  0.3 mag. of the red sequence, then we find that the DGR = 0.46  ±  0.20.

Discussion

Morphologies

The morphological fractions we find for J2215.9 - 1738 are in good agreement with studies of clusters at z  ~  1, some ~  1.5 Gyr later than the epoch at which our target cluster is observed.

[\citet=Smith_2005] studied the morphology-density relation in a sample of six clusters at z  ~  1. Assuming that J* + 1 is roughly equivalent to the magnitude limit of M*V + 1 adopted by [\citet=Smith_2005], as at the redshift of J2215.9 - 1738 the J-band samples the rest frame V-band, then the depth of our study is sufficient to make a comparison, as all the galaxies in our sample brighter than this limit have morphological classifications (see Fig. [\ref=f_zJCMD]). As [\citet=Smith_2005] quote their results in bins of local galaxy surface density Σ, we need to estimate the median local galaxy surface density for our sample in order to compare results. Following [\citet=Smith_2005], we calculate Σ for each galaxy by counting the 10 nearest neighbors with J  <  J* + 1, and dividing by the rectangular area enclosed. We find the median local galaxy surface density within a radius of 0.5 Mpc of the cluster X-ray position is [formula] Mpc- 2. In their second highest density bin with Σ  >  100 Mpc- 2, [\citet=Smith_2005] find fE + S0  =  0.6  ±  0.1, in good agreement with the results of our study.

A study of the morphology-density relation at z  ~  1 was also conducted by the ACS Guaranteed Time Observations (GTO) team [\citep=Postman_2005], who quote morphological fractions within R200 for the individual objects that make up their sample. The magnitude limit of the [\citet=Postman_2005] study is z850  ≤  24, as adopted in this work. For J2215.9 - 1738, the R200 radius is ≈  0.6 Mpc [\citep=Hilton_2007], i.e. approximately the same as the 0.5 Mpc radius in which we have calculated the morphological fractions. The mean morphological fractions within R200 for the [\citet=Postman_2005] sample (±   the standard error on the mean) are fE  =  0.38  ±  0.03; fS0  =  0.16  ±  0.04; fSp + Irr  =  0.48  ±  0.07; and fE + S0  =  0.55  ±  0.07. The results we obtain for J2215.9 - 1738 are in agreement at the <  1σ level for all morphological bins. A larger cluster sample would be needed to search for possible evolutionary effects between z  ~  1.5 and z  ~  1.

Inferred ages

The mean redshift we find for the major epoch of star formation in the early type galaxies in J2215.9 - 1738 of zf  ≈  3 - 5 (see  [\ref=s_discussionScatter]) is similar to that found for elliptical galaxies in other high redshift clusters. [\citet=MeiLynx_2006] found a mean formation redshift of zf  ≈  4 for the elliptical galaxies within 0.5 Mpc radius of the centers of the two Lynx clusters at z = 1.26, from modelling the CMR scatter using single burst BC03 models, in good agreement with our result. Similarly, [\citet=Lidman_2008] conducted a study of the J - Ks CMR in the only other z > 1.3 X-ray selected cluster currently known, XMMU J2235.3 - 2557, finding zf  ≈  4 for galaxies, selected using a color cut, within 0.2 Mpc of the cluster center.

For well studied clusters at lower redshift, slightly smaller formation redshifts have been measured from the scatter about the CMR: [\citet=Blakeslee_2003] estimated zf  ≈  2.7 from the i775 - z850 E+S0 CMR of RDCS J1252.9 - 2927 at z = 1.24, a result also found by [\citet=Lidman_2004] from the J - Ks CMR; [\citet=MeiRDCS_2006] found zf  ≈  3 from the CMR of elliptical galaxies in RDCS J0910 + 5422 at z = 1.10; and [\citet=Blakeslee_2006] estimate that the elliptical galaxies in the z = 0.83 clusters MS 1054 - 03 and RX J0152.7 - 1357 completed their major epoch of star formation at zf  >  2.2. All of these studies used BC03 stellar population synthesis models in arriving at their results.

Evolution of the color-magnitude relation

To compare our measurements of color-magnitude relation parameters with other studies at lower redshift, we derived linear conversions between observed colors and magnitudes and U - V, V (Vega) in the rest frame of the Coma cluster, using τ = 0.1 Gyr [\citet=BruzualCharlot_2003] models of several metallicities ([formula], [formula], [formula], [formula]), with a range of ages (corresponding to 2  <  zf  <  7, as appropriate for the early type population,  [\ref=s_discussionScatter] above). The method used is the same as that described in Appendix II of [\citet=Mei_2009], except that we convert magnitudes to V apparent (Vega) at the distance of the Coma cluster. The following transformations were used:

[formula]

[formula]

Note that in the following discussion, we only consider the z850 - J CMR of J2215.9 - 1738, as the z850 - Ks CMR (roughly equivalent to rest frame U - z) is a poor match to other studies in the literature. As the CMR fitting parameters for J2215.9 - 1738 derived from the morphologically and photometrically selected samples are consistent, we only quote transformed quantities corresponding to the morphologically selected sample below.

Fig. [\ref=f_U-VScatterEvolution] shows the evolution of the intrinsic scatter σint(U - V)z = 0.02 about the CMR, as traced by studies of several clusters at different redshifts. Some of the studies shown in this plot measured σint through passbands roughly equivalent to U - V at their respective redshifts, and so the correction to (U - V)z = 0.02 using the models is small. These are the [\citet=Bower_1992] study of the Coma cluster; the work by [\citet=Ellis_1997] at z  ≈  0.54; and the two z = 0.83 clusters observed by [\citet=Blakeslee_2006].

At z > 1, the ACS Guaranteed Time Observations (GTO) team measured σint in i775 - z850, which is more closely matched to rest frame U - B, and so the transformation of these results to (U - V)z = 0.02 is larger and more uncertain. Both the [\citet=Blakeslee_2003] study of RDCS J1252.9 - 2927 at z = 1.24, and the [\citet=MeiLynx_2006] study of the Lynx clusters at z = 1.26, show similar values of σint to those measured at z = 0.54 by [\citet=Ellis_1997], and z = 0.83 by [\citet=Blakeslee_2006], although the uncertainties are large.

The general trend in Fig. [\ref=f_U-VScatterEvolution] is of increasing scatter about the CMR as redshift increases, as expected if the stellar populations were formed at much higher redshifts than observed and have evolved passively thereafter. The intrinsic scatter about the red sequence observed in J2215.9 - 1738 at z = 1.46 is (U - V)z = 0.02  =  0.144  ±  0.059, more than three times as large as that observed in the Coma cluster [\citep=Bower_1992] [\citep=Eisenhardt_2007], some ~  9 Gyr earlier, and one and a half times that observed in MS 1054 - 03 and RX J0152.7 - 1357 at z = 0.83, ~  2.2 Gyr earlier.

Fig. [\ref=f_U-VSlopeEvolution] shows values of the absolute (U - V)z = 0.02 CMR slope for the same comparison sample of clusters from the literature. In contrast to the measurements of intrinsic scatter about the CMR, we see no evidence for evolution in the slope over the last ~  9 Gyr. For J2215.9 - 1738, the value of the CMR slope is - 0.057  ±  0.072, after conversion to (U - V)z = 0.02. This agrees with the slope measured for the Coma cluster [\citep=Bower_1992] [\citep=Eisenhardt_2007] at better than the < 1σ level, though the uncertainty is large. The lack of evolution of the CMR slope is consistent with the CMR remaining as primarily a sequence in metallicity up to the highest redshifts so far observed.

To compare the evolution of the CMR intercept, we used the CMR of Coma as measured by [\citet=Bower_1992] to calibrate the CMR as a metallicity sequence, and transformed the CMRs of J2215.9 - 1738 and the literature comparison sample, such that the intercept was evaluated at the V-band magnitude corresponding to solar metallicity. The metallicity calibration of the CMR of Coma was performed by calculating V-band (Vega) magnitudes corresponding to the U - V colors of τ  =  0.1 Gyr BC03 models of several metallicities, assuming the slope and intercept of the Coma CMR as measured by [\citet=Bower_1992], and formation redshift zf = 2 [\citep=Bower_1992]. Under these assumptions, solar metallicity in the Coma CMR corresponds to V(Vega)  =  13.27. We calculated the corresponding V-band magnitudes and transformed CMR intercepts for the other clusters in the comparison sample assuming passive evolution of this model. Errors in the transformed values were estimated using a Monte-Carlo method, taking into account the uncertainties in the measured CMRs, and the color and magnitude transformations to U - Vz = 0.02, V (Vega).

Fig. [\ref=f_U-VSolarMetallicityEvolution] shows the results of this exercise, with the expected passive evolution track of the baseline stellar population model overplotted, for several different formation redshifts. The CMR intercept evaluated at solar metallicity for J2215.9 - 1738 is consistent with zf = 3, which is slightly lower than the formation redshift inferred from the intrinsic scatter ( [\ref=s_discussionScatter], above), but in good agreement given the large uncertainties. This is consistent with the literature comparison sample: there is some scatter, which could indicate a range of star formation histories for the galaxy population in different clusters, but the uncertainties are large. Photometric calibration uncertainties may also contribute to the scatter; see, for example, the discussion in the [\citet=MeiLynx_2006] study of the Lynx clusters at z = 1.26.

We show the effect of changing the stellar population model from BC03 to M05 on the expected passive evolution of the colors of solar metallicity galaxies in Fig. [\ref=f_U-VSolarMetallicityEvolutionMaraston]. Lower formation redshifts are expected if this family of models is assumed, with some of the literature comparison sample being expected to have formed most of their stars at z  <  2. In the case of J2215.9 - 1738, Fig. [\ref=f_U-VSolarMetallicityEvolutionMaraston] implies zf  ≈  2. Again, this is in good agreement with the age derived from the intrinsic scatter about the CMR for the M05 models.

Dwarf-giant ratio

The Dwarf-to-Giant Ratio measured for J2215.9 - 1738 appears to be significantly lower than has been measured in clusters at lower redshifts. [\citet=DeLuciaCMR_2007] quote a red sequence luminous-to-faint ratio within r  <  0.5R200 for the Coma cluster equivalent to a DGR of 3.13  ±  0.59, nearly ten times the value of the red sequence DGR in J2215.9 - 1738 (0.32  ±  0.18). Although the DGR we measure is likely to be slightly underestimated, given that our magnitude limit is ≈  0.1 mag brighter than the faint magnitude limit adopted by [\citet=DeLuciaCMR_2007], it seems very unlikely that this would be enough to account for the deficit of faint red sequence galaxies relative to Coma.

Several studies at lower redshift have parametrized the evolution of the red sequence DGR with redshift. Recently, [\citet=GilbankBalogh_2008] compiled several measurements of the DGR in clusters at z < 1, including studies by ; [\citet=Gilbank_2008] [\citet=Hansen_2007] [\citet=DeLuciaCMR_2007]; and [\citet=Stott_2007], transformed on to a common system defined by [\citet=DeLuciaCMR_2007], as we have adopted in performing our estimate of the DGR (described in  [\ref=s_resultsDGR] above). [\citet=GilbankBalogh_2008] found that the evolution of the DGR with redshift of their composite sample is [formula]. At the redshift of J2215.9 - 1738, the expected DGR  =  0.68  ±  0.36 from this relation, in good agreement with our estimate of the DGR.

We conclude that J2215.9 - 1738 appears to show a significant deficit of faint red sequence galaxies compared to clusters in the local universe, and that the measured DGR is of similar magnitude to that expected from extrapolation of the DGR-redshift relation measured at z  <  1. However, it is known that the cluster-to-cluster scatter of the DGR is considerable [\citep=DeLuciaCMR_2007], and study of a larger sample of clusters, ideally with large numbers of spectroscopically confirmed members, at similar redshift to J2215.9 - 1738 is required in order to confirm whether or not this holds for the general population at this epoch.

Conclusions

We have conducted a study of the morphological fractions and color-magnitude relation in the galaxy cluster XMMXCS J2215.9 - 1738 at z = 1.46. This is the first such study of an X-ray selected cluster at [formula]. We found:

The brightest members of J2215.9 - 1738 have Ks magnitudes corresponding to the expected value of ~  M* in the galaxy luminosity function. This is significantly fainter than the brightest galaxies in the only other z > 1.3 X-ray selected cluster studied to date, XMMU J2235.3 - 2557 at z = 1.39 [\citep=Lidman_2008].

The morphological fractions are fE  =  0.54  ±  0.17, fS0  =  0.08  ±  0.07, fSp + Irr  =  0.38  ±  0.15, similar to other clusters at z  ~  1. Thus, the dominant component of the galaxy population observed in clusters at low redshift was already in place ~  4.5 Gyr after the Big Bang.

After transformation from z850 - J to (U - V)z = 0.02, the slope of the color-magnitude relation is consistent with that of the Coma cluster, implying little evolution over the last ~  9 Gyr, though the measurement uncertainty is large. In contrast, the intrinsic scatter about the color-magnitude relation is more than three times the value measured in the Coma cluster, after conversion from z850 - J to (U - V)z = 0.02.

From comparison with stellar population models, the intrinsic scatter about the color-magnitude relation implies mean luminosity weighted ages for the stellar populations of the early type galaxies in J2215.9 - 1738 of ≈  3 Gyr, corresponding to the main epoch of star formation in these galaxies coming to an end at zf  ≈  3 - 5. Comparison of the intercept of the color-magnitude relation with passive evolution of the same stellar population models, calibrated relative to the Coma cluster, yields consistent results.

J2215.9 - 1738 shows evidence of the 'downsizing' phenomenon: the red sequence Dwarf-to-Giant ratio for the cluster is 0.32  ±  0.18 within a radius of 0.5R200, although this is likely to be underestimated slightly in comparison to other studies due to the depth of our photometry. This is consistent with extrapolation of the redshift evolution of the DGR measured from cluster samples at z  <  1 within the large uncertainties.
