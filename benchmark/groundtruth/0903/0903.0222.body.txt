Lifts of Time Dependent Complex Hamiltonian Mechanical Systems

Introduction

Lifting theory was introduced by Bowman in 1970 [\cite=bowman]. It is well known that it permits to extend the differentiable structures. Therefore it has an important role in differential geometry. Really, in before studies, extensions of any real, complex manifold and complex product manifold were defined and the higher order vertical, complete and horizontal lifts of functions, vector fields and 1-forms on any manifold to its extension spaces were studied in [\cite=tekkoyun1] [\cite=tekkoyun2] [\cite=tekkoyun4] [\cite=tekkoyun5] and there in.

Modern differential geometry provides a fundamental framework for studying Hamiltonian mechanics. In recent years, it is possible to find many studies about differential geometric methods in mechanics [\cite=carinena] [\cite=mcrampin] [\cite=deleon1] [\cite=deleon2] and there in. We know that the dynamics of Hamiltonian formalisms is characterized by a suitable vector field defined on cotangent bundles which are phase-spaces of momentum of a given configuration manifold. [formula] is a regular Hamiltonian function then there is a unique vector field ZH on cotangent bundle [formula] such that dynamical equations

[formula]

where Φ is the symplectic form and H stands for Hamiltonian function. The paths of the Hamiltonian vector field ZH are the solutions of the Hamiltonian equations shown by

[formula]

where qi and (qi,pi),1  ≤  i  ≤  m, are coordinates of Q and T*Q. The triple, either (T*Q,Φ,ZH) or (T*Q,Φ,H), is called Hamiltonian system on the cotangent bundle T*Q with symplectic form Φ. Time dependent complex analogous of Hamiltonian equations given in ([\ref=1.2]) is the equations

[formula]

which is introduced in [\cite=tekkoyun3].

The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we recall the k-th order extension kN of a 2m+1-dimensional product manifold N and the higher order vertical, complete of functions, vector fields and 1-forms on N to kN. Also, we will give the higher order vertical and complete lifts of complex tensor field of type (1,1) on N to kN and extended contact manifolds structured in [\cite=tekkoyun5]. In sections 3 and 4 we introduce the higher order vertical and complete lifts of time dependent complex Hamiltonian equations and discuss geometric results about Hamiltonian formalisms on higher order mechanical systems.

The manifolds, tensor fields, and geometric objects we consider in this paper, are assumed to be differentiable of class C∞   (i.e., smooth) and the sum is taken over repeated indices. Unless otherwise stated it will be accepted 0  ≤  r  ≤  k,1  ≤  i  ≤  m. Also, v and c will denote the vertical and complete lifts of geometric structures on either k - 1M to kM or k - 1N to kN. Dots mean derivation with respect to time. The symbol [formula] called combination is the binomial coefficient [formula]

Preliminaries

In this section, we will summarize the studies given in [\cite=tekkoyun5], i.e., we recall k-th order extension of a complex product manifold and higher order vertical and complete lifts of differential elements on complex product manifold to its extension spaces. Also we present the manifolds named to be extended contact manifolds.

Extended Complex Product Manifolds

We say to be extended complex product manifold to the k-th order extension [formula] of 2m+1- dimensional product manifold [formula] where kM extended complex manifold. Let [formula] be a coordinate system on a neighborhood kV of any point p of kN. Therefore, by [formula] and [formula] we define natural bases over coordinate system of tangent space Tp(kN) and cotangent space [formula] of kN, respectively.

Let f be a complex function defined on N and [formula] be coordinates of N. Therefore, 1- form defined by equality

[formula]

is differential of f. Let χ(N) set of vector fields and [formula] the set of dual vector fields on N. In this case, any elements Z and ω of χ(N) and [formula] are respectively determined by

[formula]

and

[formula]

such that [formula]

Higher Order Lifts of Geometrical Structures

In this section, we recall extensions of some definitions and properties about the higher order vertical and complete of geometrical elements defined on 2m+1- dimensional product manifold N to its extension kN. The vertical lift of function f to kN is called the function fvk defined by equality

[formula]

such that a natural projection τk - 1N:kN  →  k - 1N . The complete lift of function f to kN is said to be the function fck defined by equality

[formula]

Let fcr be r -th order complete lift of a function [formula] to rN.

The vertical  and complete lifts of vector field Z on N to kN are the vector field Zvk on kN defined by equality

[formula]

Given by ([\ref=2.2]) the vector field Z defined on N. Then, vertical  and complete lifts of Z to kN are

[formula]

The vertical  and complete lifts of 1-form ω on N to kN are the 1-form ωvk on kN defined by equality

Denote by ([\ref=2.3]) the 1-form ω defined on N. Then vertical  and complete lifts of order k to kN of ω are

[formula]

The vertical lift of a tensor field of type (1,1) φ to kN is the structure φvk on kN given by

[formula]

The complete lift of a tensor field of type (1,1) φ to kN is the structure φck on kN given by

[formula]

Let [formula] be k-th extension of 2m+1- dimensional product manifold [formula] i.e., let kN be extended complex product manifold. A triple (φck,ξck,ηvk)(or (φck,ξck,ηck)), is called an extended contact structure on kN such that φvk,φck are tensors of type (1,1), ξck is a vector field and ηvk,ηck are differential 1-forms on kN defined by

[formula]

An extended manifold kN endowed with a contact structure (φck,ξck,ηvk)(or (φck,ξck,ηck)) is said to be an extended contact manifold. It is well-known that if k = 0, the manifold N = M  ×  R with contact structure (φ,ξ,η) is named contact manifold. By means of ([\ref=7.1]), the higher order vertical and complete lifts of a tensor field of type (1,1) on a contact manifold N obey the following generic properties for all [formula] and [formula]or (φck)) = m(k + 1).

Higher Order Vertical Lifts of Time Dependent Hamiltonians

In this section, we introduce higher order vertical lifts of time dependent Hamiltonian equations for classical mechanics structured on contact manifold. Let kN be k-th order extension of contact manifold N fixed with extended coordinates [formula]. Then we define vector fields [formula] and dual covector fields [formula] being bases of tangent space Tp(kN) and cotangent space [formula] of kN. [formula] and [formula] are respectively k-th order complete and vertical lifts of contact structure [formula] being the dual of   φ and Liouville form λ on N. If Φvk =  - dλvk is k-th order vertical lift of closed 2-form Φ =  - dλ, then we say that Φvk is a closed 2-form on kM.

A time -dependent vector field on an extended Kaehlerian manifold kM is a C∞   map [formula] such that Zvk(t,p)∈Tp(kM). All the results obtained on extended Kaehlerian manifold kM hold for time dependent vector fields. Hence, we set Φvkt,s(p) to be the integral curve of Zvkt trough time t = s, i.e.,

[formula]

and

[formula]

where Zvkt is the vector field on kM given by Zvkt(p) = Zvk(t,p). In fact, φvkt,s is the (time -dependent) local 1-parameter group generated by Zvkt.

Let [formula] be a function on kN. For each [formula] we define [formula] by Hvkt(p) = Hvk(t,p). By time dependent Hamiltonian vector field we call the vector field ZvkHt on kM with energy Hvkt given by the isomorphism

[formula]

where for simplicity, we set Zvkt = ZvkHvkt. Consider a mapping [formula] by Zvk(t,p) = Zvkt(p)∈Tp(kM), [formula] p∈kM. Then there is a vector field ZvkHvk on extended contact manifold kN given by [formula] i.e.,

[formula]

Proposition 1: Let kM be extended Kaehlerian manifold with closed 2-form Φvk. The k-th order vertical lift of Hamiltonian vector field Zt on Kaehlerian manifold M endowed with closed 2-form Φ is given by

[formula]

Proof: Let kM be extended Kaehlerian manifold with closed 2-form Φvk. Consider that Zvkt is the k-th order vertical lift of Hamiltonian vector field Zt associated Hamiltonian energy Ht. Also, Zvkt is Hamiltonian vector field Zvkt associated Hamiltonian energy Hvktand given by

[formula]

For the closed 2-form Φvk on kM, we find

[formula]

Taking into consideration the isomorphism given in ([\ref=8.3]), we calculate by

[formula]

On the other hand, the differential of Hamiltonian energy Hvkt on kM we give by

[formula]

From equality ([\ref=8.3]), the k-th order vertical lift of Hamiltonian vector field on Kaehlerian manifold M fixed with closed 2-form Φ we find as

[formula]

Thus, proof is complete. [formula]

Suppose that the curve

[formula]

be an integral curve of Hamiltonian vector field ZvkH,with ε > 0, i.e.,

[formula]

In the local coordinates we have

[formula]

So, we obtain

[formula]

Now, from [formula] then we infer the following equations

[formula]

that is called k-th order vertical lift of time dependent complex Hamiltonian equations on contact manifold N.

In ([\ref=8.14]), if k=0, we get the equations

[formula]

or

[formula]

which is time dependent complex Hamiltonian equations on contact manifold N determined in ([\ref=1.3]) and introduced in [\cite=tekkoyun3].

Higher Order Complete Lifts of Time Dependent Hamiltonians

In this section, we bring in higher order complete lifts of time dependent complex Hamiltonian equations for classical mechanics structured on contact manifold. Let kN be k-th order extension of contact manifold N and endowed with extended coordinates [formula]. Then by [formula] and [formula] we determine vector fields and dual covector fields being bases of tangent space Tp(kN) and cotangent space [formula] of kN, respectively. We define by [formula] and [formula] the k-th order complete lifts of contact structure [formula] being the dual of   φ and Liouville form λ on M, respectively. If Φck =  - dλck is k-th order vertical lift of closed 2-form Φ =  - dλ, then we say that Φck is a closed 2-form on extended Kaehlerian manifold kM. A time -dependent vector field on an extended Kaehlerian manifold kM is a C∞   map Zck:kN  →  T(kM) such that Zck(t,p)∈Tp(kM). All the results obtained on extended Kaehlerian manifold kM hold for time dependent vector fields. Hence, we set Φckt,s(p) to be the integral curve of Zckt trough time t = s, i.e.,

[formula]

and

[formula]

where Zckt is the vector field on kM given by Zckt(p) = Zck(t,p). In fact, φckt,s is the (time -dependent ) local 1-parameter group generated by Zckt.

Let [formula] be a function on kN. For each [formula] we define [formula] by Hckt(p) = Hck(t,p). By time dependent Hamiltonian vector field we say to be the vector field ZckHt on kM with energy Hckt given by the isomorphism

[formula]

where for simplicity, we set Zckt = ZckHckt. Define a mapping Zck:kN  →  T(kM) by Zck(t,p) = Zckt(p)∈Tp(kM), [formula] p∈kM. Then there is a vector field ZckHck on extended contact manifold kN given by [formula] i.e.,

[formula]

Proposition 2: Let kM be extended Kaehlerian manifold with closed 2-form Φck. The k-th order complete lift of Hamiltonian vector field Zt on Kaehlerian manifold M fixed with closed 2-form Φ is given by

[formula]

Proof: Let kM be extended Kaehlerian manifold with closed Kaehlerian form Φck. Consider that Zckt be the k-th order complete lift of Hamiltonian vector field Zt associated Hamiltonian energy Ht and given by

[formula]

For the closed Kaehlerian form Φck on kM, we obtain

[formula]

Using by the isomorphism given in ([\ref=9.3]), we find

[formula]

On the other hand, the differential of Hamiltonian energy Hcktwe define by

[formula]

By means of equality ([\ref=9.3]), the Hamiltonian vector field Zckton extended Kaehlerian manifold kM is calculated as follows:

[formula]

Hence, proof finishes. [formula]

Assume that the curve

[formula]

be an integral curve of Hamiltonian vector field ZckH,with ε > 0, i.e.,

[formula]

In the local coordinates it holds

[formula]

Therefore we have

[formula]

Now, from [formula] then the equations obtained by

[formula]

are k-th order complete lift of time dependent complex Hamiltonian equations on contact manifold N.

In ([\ref=9.14]), if k=0, we have the equations

[formula]

or

[formula]

which is time dependent complex Hamiltonian equations on contact manifold N given in ([\ref=1.3]) and obtained in [\cite=tekkoyun3].

Corollary: By means of the equations found the above, we conclude that the Hamiltonian formalisms in generalized classical mechanics and field theory can be intrinsically characterized on the extended contact manifolds kN, and the geometric approach of complex Hamiltonian systems is that the solutions of time dependent vector fields Zvkt and Zckt on extended Kaehlerian manifolds kM are paths time dependent complex Hamiltonian equations obtained ([\ref=8.14]) and ([\ref=9.14]) on extended contact manifolds kN, respectively. Hence, by means of the lifting theory, it is shown that Hamiltonian formalism may be generalized to extended contact manifolds kN.
