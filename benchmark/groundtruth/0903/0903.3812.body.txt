Introduction

We consider only finite, non-oriented graphs without loops and multiple edges. The vertex set and the edge set of a graph G will be denoted by V(G) and E(G), respectively. A graph G is said to be an empty graph if [formula]. We call a p-clique of a graph G a set of p pairwise adjacent vertices. The largest integer p such that the graph G contains a p-clique is denoted by [formula]. A set of vertices of a graph is said to be independent if every two of them are not adjacent. We shall also use the following notations:

[formula] is the complement of G;

α(G) is the vertex independence number of G, i.e., [formula];

χ(G) is the chromatic number of G;

[formula];

Kn is the complete graph on n vertices;

Cn is the simple cycle on n vertices;

[formula].

The graph G is a (p,q)-graph if [formula] and α(G) < q. The Ramsey number R(p,q) is the smallest natural n such that every graph G with |V(G)|  ≥  n is not a (p,q)-graph. An exposition of the results on the Ramsey numbers is given in [\cite=Rad06]. We shall need Table [\ref=t:1.1] of the known Ramsey numbers R(p,3) (see [\cite=Rad06]).

Let G1 and G2 be two graphs without common vertices. We denote by G1 + G2 the graph G for which [formula] and [formula] where E' = {,x∈V(G1),y∈V(G2)}. A graph G is separable if G = G1 + G2, where [formula], i = 1,2.

Let [formula] be a set of graphs. We say that G0∈M is a minimal graph in M if |V(G0)| =  min {|V(G)|:G∈M}.

Let [formula] be positive integers. The symbol [formula] means that in every r-coloring

[formula]

of the vertices of G for some [formula] there exists a monochromatic ai-clique Q of color i, that is Q  ⊆  Vi.

Define

[formula]

It is clear that [formula] implies [formula]. Folkman proved in [\cite=Folkman] that there exists a graph G such that [formula] and [formula]. Therefore,

[formula]

The numbers [formula] are called vertex Folkman numbers. If [formula] are positive integers, r  ≥  2 and ai = 1 then it is easy to see that

[formula]

Hence, for ai = 1

[formula]

Thus, it is enough to consider just such numbers [formula] for which ai  ≥  2. In this paper we consider the Folkman numbers [formula]. Set

[formula]

By [\eqref=1.1]

[formula]

It is clear that

[formula]

Since [formula] and [formula] we have

[formula]

According to [\eqref=1.4] it is enough to consider just such numbers Fv(2r;r - k + 1) for which k  ≥   - 1. In this paper we shall prove the following results.

Let r and k be integers such that - 1  ≤  k  ≤  5 and r  ≥  k + 2. Then

Fv(2r;r - k + 1)  ≥  r + 2k + 3;

Fv(2r;r - k + 1) = r + 2k + 3 if k∈{0,2,3,4,5} and r  ≥  2k + 2 or k∈{ - 1,1} and r  ≥  2k + 3.

Let r  ≥  8 be a natural number. Then

Fv(2r;r - 5)  ≥  r + 14 and Fv(2r;r - 5) = r + 14 if and only if r  ≥  13;

Fv(2r;r - 6)  ≥  r + 16 if r  ≥  9 and Fv(2r;r - 6) = r + 16 if r  ≥  15;

Fv(2r;r - 7)  ≥  r + 17, r  ≥  10 and Fv(2r;r - 7) = r + 17 if and only if r  ≥  16;

Fv(2r;r - 8)  ≥  r + 18, r  ≥  11 and Fv(2r;r - 8) = r + 18 if and only if r  ≥  17;

Fv(2r;r - 9)  ≥  r + 20, r  ≥  12 and Fv(2r;r - 9) = r + 20 if r  ≥  19.

Let r  ≥  13 be a natural number. Then

Fv(2r;r - 10)  ≥  r + 21 and Fv(2r;r - 10) = r + 21 if R(10,3) > 41 and r  ≥  20;

If R(10,3)  ≤  41 we have Fv(2r;r - 10)  ≥  r + 22 and Fv(2r;r - 10) = r + 22 if r  ≥  21.

Let r and k be natural numbers such that r  ≥  k + 2 and k  ≥  12. Then

Fv(2r;r - k + 1)  ≥  r + k + 11;

If k = 12 and r  ≥  22 then Fv(2r;r - 11) = r + 23.

By [\eqref=1.2] the number Fv(2r;r - k + 1) exists if and only if r  ≥  k + 2. Thus, the inequality r  ≥  k + 2 in the statements of these Theorems is necessary.

The case k = 0 of Theorem [\ref=th:1.1] was proved by Dirac in [\cite=Dirac]. It was also proved in [\cite=Dirac] that the graph Kr - 2 + C5, r  ≥  2 is the only minimal graph in Hv(2r;r + 1). The cases k = 1 and k = 2 of Theorem [\ref=th:1.1] were proved in [\cite=Nen83]. It was also proved in [\cite=Nen83] that Kr - 5 + C5 + C5, r  ≥  5 is the only minimal graph in Hv(2r;r) (see also [\cite=Nen03]). The case k = 3 was proved in [\cite=Nen81a]. We gave new proofs of the cases k = 2 and k = 3 of Theorem [\ref=th:1.1] in [\cite=NenAnn].

The method we use here does not allow us to compute the numbers Fr(2r;r - k + 1) when r < 2k + 2 and 1  ≤  k  ≤  5. We know only the following numbers of this kind:

[formula]

We know about number F4(25;4) only that 12  ≤  Fv(25;4)  ≤  16 (see [\cite=NenAnn]).

If k  ≥  2 then there is more than one minimal graph in Hv(2r;r - 1). For example, if r  ≥  8 the graph Kr - 8 + C5 + C5 + C5 is also minimal in Hv(2r;r - 1) besides the minimal graph from the proof of Theorem [\ref=th:1.1].

Luczak et al. [\cite=LucRucUrb] proved the inequality

[formula]

They also proved that [\eqref=1.5] is strict when k is very large (see [\cite=LucRucUrb]). It can be easily seen from Theorem [\ref=th:1.1] and Theorem [\ref=th:1.2] (a) that k = 6 is the smallest value of k for which the inequality [\eqref=1.5] is strict.

Auxiliary Results

The following lemmas are used to prove the main results.

Let q  ≥  4 be an integer and G be a minimal graph (see Definition [\ref=d:1.1]) in Hv(2r;q - 1). Then

[formula]

Let A  ⊆  V(G) be an independent set of vertices of G such that |A| = α(G). Consider the graph G' = K1 + (G - A). By [\eqref=1.3], χ(G)  ≥  r + 1. Since A is an independent vertex set it follows that χ(G - A)  ≥  r and χ(G')  ≥  r + 1. By [\eqref=1.3], [formula]. Since [formula] we have [formula]. Hence, G'∈Hv(2r;q) and

[formula]

Lemma [\ref=l:2.1] follows from this inequality because |V(G)| = Fv(2r;q - 1).

Let q and r be integers such that 4  ≤  q < r + 3. Then

Fv(2r;q - 1)  ≥  Fv(2r,q) + 1;

If Fv(2r;q) + 1  ≥  R(q - 1,3) then the inequality (a) is strict.

Let G be a minimal graph in Hv(2r;q - 1). By [\eqref=1.3], χ(G)  ≥  r + 1. Since [formula] and q < r + 3 we have

[formula]

Thus, α(G)  ≥  2 and inequality (a) follows from Lemma [\ref=l:2.1].

Let Fv(2r;q) + 1  ≥  R(q - 1,3). Then we see from (a) that

[formula]

Since [formula], this inequality implies α(G)  ≥  3. From Lemma [\ref=l:2.1] we obtain

[formula]

The Corollary [\ref=cor:2.1] is proved.

A graph G is said to be k-chromatic if χ(G) = k. A graph G is defined to be vertex-critical chromatic if χ(G - v) < χ(G) for all v∈V(G).

Let q  ≥  3 be an integer and let G be a minimal graph in Hv(2r;q). Then

G is a vertex-critical (r + 1)-chromatic graph;

If q < r + 3 then [formula].

Proof of (a). By [\eqref=1.3], χ(G)  ≥  r + 1. Assume that (a) is wrong. Then there exists v∈V(G) such that χ(G - v)  ≥  r + 1. Thus, according to [\eqref=1.3], G - v∈Hv(2r;q). This contradicts the minimality of G in Hv(2r;q).

Proof of (b). Assume that (b) is wrong. Then, since [formula] we have [formula]. Thus, G∈Hv(2r;q - 1). Hence [formula] and, by [\eqref=1.2], q  ≥  4. So,

[formula]

Since q < r + 3 this contradicts Corollary [\ref=cor:2.1] (a).

The following obvious equalities

[formula]

are used to prove the following Lemma [\ref=l:2.3].

Let [formula]. Then it easily follows from [\eqref=2.1] and [\eqref=2.2] that

[formula]

Let m and k be positive integers such that m  ≥  k + 3 and 2m - 1 < R(m - k,3). Let

[formula]

Then

[formula]

It follows from r  ≥  m - 1 and m  ≥  k + 3 that r - k + 1  ≥  3. Thus, by [\eqref=1.2], the number Fv(2r;r - k + 1) exists.

We need to prove that

[formula]

It follows from 0 < 2m - 1 < R(m - k,3) that there exists a graph P such that |V(P)| = 2m - 1, [formula] and α(G) < 3. Define

[formula]

Since |V(P)| = 2m - 1 and α(P) < 3 we have χ(P)  ≥  m. From [\eqref=2.1] we see that χ(P(r))  ≥  r + 1. The inequality [formula] together with [\eqref=2.2] implies that [formula]. Hence, by [\eqref=1.3], P(r)∈Hv(2r;r - k + 1) and

[formula]

Lemma [\ref=2.3] is proved.

It is clear from the proof of Lemma [\ref=l:2.3] that the following theorem is true:

Let m and k be positive integers such that

[formula]

Then Fv(2r;r - k + 1)  ≤  r + m if r  ≥  m - 1.

Some Properties of the Minimal Graphs in M(x,y)

Let x and y be integers. Define

[formula]

In this section we shall prove some properties of the minimal graphs in M(x,y) (see Definition [\ref=d:1.1]). These properties will be need for the proofs of Theorem [\ref=th:4.1] and Theorem [\ref=th:4.2] in the Section [\ref=s:4]. If x < 0 then the empty graph belongs to M(x,y) and hence it is the only minimal graph in M(x,y). That is why we shall assume x  ≥  0.

The aim of this section is to prove the following result:

Let [formula], x  ≥  0 and let G0 be a minimal graph in M(x,y). If G0 is a nonseparable graph then:

|V(G0)| = 4f(G0) - 2x - 1;

4f(G0) - 2x - 1 < R(f(G0) - x + 1,3) where R(p,3) is the Ramsey number.

An important result of Gallai that we shall need later is:

Let G be a vertex-critical chromatic graph and χ(G)  ≥  2. Then, if |V(G)| < 2χ(G) - 1, the graph G is separable in the sense that G = G1 + G2, where [formula], i = 1,2.

In the original statement of Theorem [\ref=th:3.2] the graph G is edge-critical (and not vertex-critical) chromatic. Since each vertex-critical chromatic graph G contains an edge-critical chromatic subgraph H such that χ(H) = χ(G) and V(H) = V(G) the above statement of Theorem [\ref=th:3.2] is equivalent to the original one.

In the proof of Theorem [\ref=th:3.1] we shall use the following two Lemmas.

Let [formula], x  ≥  0 and G0 be a minimal graph in M(x,y). Let [formula] be an independent vertex set of G0 and G'0 = G0 - A. Then

χ(G'0) = χ(G0) - 1;

[formula];

|V(G0)| = χ(G0) + 2f(G0) - x - 1.

Proof of (a). Since A is an independent vertex set we have χ(G'0) = χ(G0) - 1 or χ(G'0) = χ(G0). Assume that (a) is wrong. Then χ(G'0) = χ(G0). Let χ(G'0) = χ(G0) = m and

[formula]

where Vi are independent sets of G0. Note that [formula]. Thus, after adding new edges

[formula]

Let [formula], x  ≥  0 and let G0 be minimal graph in M(x,y). Then

G0 is a [formula]-graph;

|V(G0)|  ≤  2χ(G0) - 1;

|V(G0)|  ≥  4f(G0) - 2x - 1.

Proof of (a). We need to prove that α(G0) < 3. Assume the opposite and let {u,v,w} be an independent vertex set of G0. Consider the subgraph G'0 = G0  -  {u,v,w}. By Lemma [\ref=l:3.1], we have χ(G'0) = χ(G0) - 1 and f(G'0) = f(G0) - 1. Since f(G'0) < y and |V(G'0)| < |V(G0)|, it follows from the minimality of G0 that

[formula]

As |V(G0)| = |V(G'0)| + 3 it follows that |V(G0)|  ≥  χ(G0) + 2f(G0) - x. This contradicts G0∈M(x,y).

Proof of (b). By (a), α(G0) < 3. Thus, we have |V(G0)|  ≤  2χ(G0) and we need to prove that |V(G0)|  ≠  2χ(G0). Assume the opposite, i.e., |V(G0)| = 2χ(G0) and let v∈V(G0). Consider the subgraph G'0  =  G0 - v. By Lemma [\ref=l:3.1] (a), χ(G'0) = χ(G0) - 1. Since α(G'0) < 3 it follows that |V(G'0)|  ≤  2χ(G'0) - 2 which is a contradiction.

Proof of (c). From (b) and Lemma [\ref=l:3.1] (c) we obtain

[formula]

By this inequality and Lemma [\ref=l:3.1] (c) we see that

[formula]

Proof of (a). According to Lemma [\ref=l:3.1] (a) G0 is a vertex-critical chromatic graph. Since G0 is nonseparable, it follows from Lemma [\ref=l:3.2] (b) and Theorem [\ref=th:3.2] that

[formula]

By [\eqref=3.2] and Lemma [\ref=l:3.1] (c) we obtain

[formula]

Proof of (b). According to Lemma [\ref=l:3.2] (a) we have

[formula]

From this inequality and [\eqref=3.3] it follows (b).

Theorem [\ref=th:3.1] is proved.

A Lower Bound for |V(G)| when f(G)  ≤  13

In this section our goal is to prove the following two theorems.

Let G be a graph such that f(G)  ≤  11. Then

|V(G)|  ≥  χ(G) + 2f(G) if f(G)  ≤  6;

|V(G)|  ≥  χ(G) + 2f(G) - 1 if f(G) = 7 or f(G) = 8;

|V(G)|  ≥  χ(G) + 16 if f(G) = 9;

|V(G)|  ≥  χ(G) + 2f(G) - 3 if f(G) = 10 or f(G) = 11.

Let G be a graph such that f(G)  ≤  13. Then

|V(G)|  ≥  χ(G) + 2f(G) - 4;

If f(G) = 12 and R(10,3)  ≤  41 then the inequality (a) is strict.

If f(G)  ≥  7 then the inequality (a) of Theorem [\ref=th:4.1] is not true. For example if G is a minimal graph in Hv(2r;r - 5) we have from Lemma [\ref=l:2.2] that χ(G) = r + 1, [formula] and f(G) = 7. By Theorem [\ref=th:1.2] we see that

[formula]

In the same way we also see that the conditions for f(G) in the statements (b), (c) and (d) of Theorem [\ref=th:4.1] are necessary.

If f(G)  ≤  6 the inequality (a) of Theorem [\ref=th:4.1] is exact. Indeed, if G is a minimal graph in Hv(2r;r - k + 1) where - 1  ≤  k  ≤  5, by Lemma [\ref=l:2.2] we have χ(G) = r + 1, [formula] and f(G) = k + 1  ≤  6. When r is large enough we have according to Theorem [\ref=1.1]

[formula]

In the same way (using Theorem [\ref=th:1.2]) we see that the inequalities (b), (c) and (d) are exact.

If f(G) = 13 the inequality (a) of Theorem [\ref=th:4.2] is exact by Theorem [\ref=th:1.4] (b). If f(G) = 12 and R(10,3)  ≥  42 this inequality is exact according to Theorem [\ref=th:1.3] (a).

We shall use the following two lemmas in the proof of Theorem [\ref=th:4.1] and Theorem [\ref=th:4.2].

Let [formula]. Then every minimal graph in M(0,y) is nonseparable.

Assume the opposite and let G0 be a minimal graph in M(0,y) such that G0 = G1 + G2, where [formula], i = 1,2. Since |V(Gi)| < |V(G0)| we have Gi∉M(0,y). Since f(Gi)  ≤  f(G)  ≤  y it follows that

[formula]

Summing these two inequalities we obtain, by [\eqref=2.1] and [\eqref=2.3], that

[formula]

a contradiction.

[formula] if y  ≤  6.

Assume the opposite, i.e., [formula] for some y  ≤  6. Let G0 be minimal in M(0,y). Then f(G0)  ≤  6. According to Lemma [\ref=l:4.1] G0 is nonseparable. Thus, by Theorem [\ref=3.1] (b) (x = 0) we have

[formula]

for f(G0)  ≤  6 which is a contradiction (see Table [\ref=t:1.1]).

Let G be a graph such that

[formula]

Then |V(G)|  ≥  27.

Since G∈M(0,f(G)) we have [formula]. Let G0 be a minimal graph in M(0,f(G)). By Corollary [\ref=cor:4.1], f(G0)  ≥  7. Thus, it follows from Lemma [\ref=l:3.2] (c) that V(G)|  ≥  |V(G0)|  ≥  27.

Let [formula] where x  ≥  0 and y  ≤  13. Then every minimal graph in M(x,y) is nonseparable.

Assume the opposite and let G0 be a minimal graph in M(x,y) such that G0 = G1 + G2, [formula], i = 1,2. Let f(G1)  ≤  f(G2). Then f(G1)  ≤  6 because f(G1) + f(G2) = f(G0)  ≤  13. By Corollary [\ref=cor:4.1] we obtain that

[formula]

Since G2∉M(x,y) and f(G2)  ≤  y we have that

[formula]

Summing the inequalities [\eqref=4.1] and [\eqref=4.2] we obtain by [\eqref=2.1] and [\eqref=2.3] that

[formula]

which is a contradiction.

Statement (a) follows immediately from Corollary [\ref=cor:4.1].

Proof of (b). Assume the opposite. Then [formula]. Let G0 be a minimal graph in M(1,8). It is easy to see that

[formula]

Thus, by Corollary [\ref=cor:4.1], we have f(G0)  ≥  7, i.e., f(G0) = 7 or f(G0) = 8. According to Lemma [\ref=l:4.2] G0 is nonseparable. Thus, from Theorem [\ref=th:3.1] (x = 1), it follows that

[formula]

where f(G0) = 7 or f(G0) = 8, which is a contradiction.

The proofs of statements (c) and (d) are completely similar to that of statement (b).

Theorem [\ref=th:4.1] is proved.

Proof of (a). Assume the opposite. Then [formula]. Let G0 be a minimal graph in M(4,13). It is clear that

[formula]

Thus, it follows from Theorem [\ref=4.1] that f(G0)  ≥  12. Hence f(G0) = 12 or f(G0) = 13. By Lemma [\ref=l:4.2], G0 is nonseparable. Thus, Theorem [\ref=th:3.1] (b) (x = 4) implies

[formula]

where f(G0) = 12 or f(G0) = 13 which is a contradiction.

Proof of (b). Assume the opposite. Then [formula]. Let G0 be a minimal graph in M(3,12). From Theorem [\ref=th:4.1] it follows that f(G0) = 12. Since G0, by Lemma [\ref=l:4.2], is nonseparable it follows from Theorem [\ref=th:3.1] (b) that

[formula]

where f(G0) = 12 which is a contradiction, by our assumption R(10,3)  ≤  41.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=th:1.1] and Theorem [\ref=th:1.2]

Proof of (a). Let G be a minimal in Hv(2r;r - k + 1). By Lemma [\ref=l:2.2] χ(G) = r + 1, [formula] and f(G) = k + 1. Since k  ≤  5 we have f(G)  ≤  6. Thus, from Theorem [\ref=th:4.1] (a) it follows that

[formula]

Proof of (b). We shall consider the following three cases.

Case 1. k =  - 1. In this case (b) follows from [\eqref=1.4].

Case 2. k∈{0,2,3,4,5}. By Table [\ref=t:1.1] in this case the following inequality

[formula]

holds. Thus, by Lemma [\ref=l:2.3] we obtain Fv(2r;r - k + 1) = r + 2k + 3 if r  ≥  2k + 2.

Case 3. k = 1. We need to prove that Fv(2r;r)  ≤  r + 5 if r  ≥  5. Define

[formula]

By [\eqref=2.1] and [\eqref=2.2] we have χ(P(r)) = r + 1 and [formula]. Thus, from [\eqref=1.3] it follows that P(r)∈Hv(2r;r). Hence

[formula]

and Theorem [\ref=th:1.1] is proved.

Proof of (a). Let G be a minimal graph in Hv(2r;r - 5). Then, by Lemma [\ref=l:2.2], χ(G) = r + 1, [formula] and f(G) = 7. Thus, from Theorem [\ref=th:4.1] (b) it follows

[formula]

Applying Lemma [\ref=l:2.3] (k = 6, m = 14) we obtain

[formula]

Let 8  ≤  r  ≤  12. From Table [\ref=t:1.1] we see that R(r - 5,3)  ≤  r + 14. By Theorem [\ref=th:1.1] (k = 5) we have Fv(2r;r - 4)  ≥  r + 13 and thus Fv(2r;r - 4) + 1  ≥  R(r - 5,3). According to Corollary [\ref=cor:2.1] (b) (q = r - 4), Fv(2r;r - 5)  ≥  r + 15.

Proof of (b). Let G be a minimal graph in Hv(2r;r - 6). By Lemma [\ref=l:2.2], χ(G) = r + 1 and f(G) = 8. From Theorem [\ref=th:4.1] (b) it follows that

[formula]

Thus, Lemma [\ref=l:2.3] (k = 7, m = 16) implies Fv(2r;r - 6) = r + 16 if r  ≥  15.

Proof of (c). Let G be a minimal graph in Hv(2r;r - 7). By Lemma [\ref=l:2.2], χ(G) = r + 1 and f(G) = 9. Thus, from Theorem [\ref=th:4.1] (c) it follows that Fv(2r;r - 7)  ≥  r + 17, r  ≥  10. From this inequality and Lemma [\ref=l:2.3] (k = 8, m = 17) we see that Fv(2r;r - 7) = r + 17 if r  ≥  16.

Let 10  ≤  r  ≤  15. By Table [\ref=t:1.1] we have that R(r - 7,3) < r + 17. Since, by (b), Fv(2r;r - 6) + 1  ≥  r + 17 we have Fv(2r;r - 6) + 1 > R(r - 7,3). From Corollary [\ref=cor:2.1] (b), the inequality Fv(2r;r - 7)  ≥  r + 18 holds.

Proof of (d). If G be a minimal graph in Hv(2r;r - 8) then, by Lemma [\ref=l:2.2], χ(G) = r + 1 and f(G) = 10. From Theorem [\ref=th:4.1] (d) it follows that

[formula]

Applying Lemma [\ref=l:2.3] (k = 9, m = 18) we obtain Fv(2r;r - 8) = r + 18 if r  ≥  17.

Let [formula]. In this case we have R(r - 8,3)  ≤  r + 18. By (c), Fv(2r;r - 7)  ≥  r + 17. Thus, Fv(2r;r - 7) + 1  ≥  R(r - 8,3) and, by Corollary [\ref=cor:2.1] (b), Fv(2r;r - 8)  ≥  r + 19.

Proof of (e). Let G be a minimal graph in Hv(2r;r - 9). According to Lemma [\ref=l:2.2] we have χ(G) = r + 1 and f(G) = 11. By Theorem [\ref=th:4.1] (d) we obtain

[formula]

This inequality and Lemma [\ref=l:2.3] (k = 10, m = 20) imply that Fv(2r;r - 9) = r + 20 if r  ≥  19.

Theorem [\ref=th:1.2] is proved.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=th:1.3] and Theorem [\ref=th:1.4]

Let G be a minimal graph in Hv(2r;r - 10). According to Lemma [\ref=l:2.2] we have χ(G) = r + 1 and f(G) = 12. Thus, by Theorem [\ref=th:4.2] (a) it follows that

[formula]

Let R(10,3) > 41. Then, by Lemma [\ref=l:2.3] (k = 11, m = 21) it follows that

[formula]

Let R(10,3)  ≤  41. From Theorem [\ref=th:4.2] (b) we obtain |V(G)| = Fv(2r;r - 10)  ≥  r + 22. Applying Lemma [\ref=l:2.3] (k = 11, m = 22) we deduce that Fv(2r;r - 10) = r + 22 if r  ≥  21 because 43 < R(11,3) (see [\cite=Rad06]).

Proof of (a). The proof is by induction on k with induction base k = 12. Let G be a minimal graph in Hv(2r;r - 11). Then, by Theorem [\ref=l:4.2] (a) we obtain

[formula]

We are done with the base k = 12. Let k  ≥  13 and

[formula]

Then, by Corollary [\ref=cor:2.1] (a) it follows that

[formula]

Proof of (b). From [\eqref=6.1] and Lemma [\ref=l:2.3] (k = 12, m = 23) we deduce that Fv(2r;r - 11) = r + 23 if r  ≥  22 because R(11,3) > 45 (see [\cite=Rad06]).

Theorem [\ref=th:1.4] is proved.

Lower Bounds for Arbitrary Vertex Folkman numbers

Let [formula] be positive integers. Define

[formula]

It is easy to see that [formula] and [formula]. Therefore

[formula]

By [\eqref=1.1]. the Folkman number [formula] exists only when [formula]. It was proved in [\cite=LucRucUrb] that

[formula]

The exact values of all numbers [formula] for which [formula] are known. A detailed exposition of these results was given in [\cite=Nen02]. We must add the equality Fv(2,2,3;4) = 14 obtained in [\cite=ColRad06]. We do not know any exact values of [formula] in the case when [formula].

In this section we shall use the following result [\cite=Nen01]

[formula]

Let G be a minimal graph in [formula]. Then, be [\eqref=7.2] and [\eqref=1.3] it follows that G∈Hv(2m - 1;q). Thus we have |V(G)|  ≥  Fv(2m - 1;q). So, we obtain

[formula]

where m is defined by the equality [\eqref=7.1]. From [\eqref=7.3], Theorem [\ref=th:1.1], Theorem [\ref=th:1.2], Theorem [\ref=th:1.3] and Theorem [\ref=th:1.4] we easily get the following theorem:

Let [formula] be integers, ai  ≥  2, [formula] and [formula]. Let k be an integer such that

[formula]

Then the following inequalities hold:

[formula]

According to [\eqref=1.1] the inequality [\eqref=7.4] in the statement of Theorem [\ref=th:7.1] is necessary.

Since all inequalities are proved in the same way, we shall prove the last one only. By Theorem [\ref=th:1.4] we have

[formula]

As [formula], it follows from [\eqref=7.4] that m - 1  ≥  k + 2. Thus, the inequality [\eqref=7.5] is true for r = m - 1, i.e.,

[formula]

We obtain from [\eqref=7.6] and [\eqref=7.3] that

[formula]

Dudek and Rödl [\cite=Dudek08-4] proved that

[formula]

where [formula] and c is a constant depending only on r.

Lower Bounds for Edge Folkman Numbers

Let [formula] be integers, ai  ≥  2. The symbol [formula] denotes that in every r-coloring of the edge set E(G) there exists a monochromatic ai-clique of color i for some [formula]. Define

[formula]

It is clear that from [formula] it follows [formula]. There exists a graph [formula] and [formula]. In the case r = 2 this was proved in [\cite=Folkman] and the general case in [\cite=Nes76]. Thus, we have

[formula]

The numbers [formula] are called edge Folkman numbers.

From definition of Ramsey number [formula] it follows that

[formula]

Thus, we consider only numbers [formula], where k  ≥   - 1. An exposition of the known edge Folkman numbers is given in [\cite=KolNen]. We must add the new upper bounds for the number Fe(3,3;4) obtained in [\cite=Dudek08-5] and [\cite=Lu].

In this section we shall use the following result obtained by S. Lin [\cite=Lin]

[formula]

From [\eqref=8.2] and [\eqref=1.3] we see that

[formula]

where [formula]. Thus, we have

[formula]

From [\eqref=8.3], Theorem [\ref=th:1.1], Theorem [\ref=th:1.2], Theorem [\ref=th:1.3] and Theorem [\ref=th:1.4] it easily follows the following statement.

Let [formula] be integers, ai  ≥  2, [formula]. Let

[formula]

where k  ≥   - 1 is integer and [formula]. Then

[formula]

According to [\eqref=8.1] the inequality

[formula]

in the statement of Theorem [\ref=th:8.1] is necessary.

In the particular cases k = 0 and k = 1 Theorem [\ref=th:8.1] was proved by S. Lin [\cite=Lin]. Lin [\cite=Lin] also proved that when k = 0 the respective inequality in Theorem [\ref=th:8.1] is exact and the conjecture was raised that if k = 1 the first inequality in Theorem [\ref=th:8.1] is strict. This Lin's hypothesis was disproved in [\cite=Nen80], where the equality Fe(3,3,3;16) = 21 was established. The particular cases k = 2 and k = 3 of Theorem [\ref=th:8.1] were proved in [\cite=Nen81b] and [\cite=Nen81a], respectively. In [\cite=Nen81b] and [\cite=Nen81a] it was also proved that if k = 2 and k = 3 then respective inequalities of Theorem [\ref=th:8.1] are exact. The other inequalities are new. We do not know whether these inequalities are exact.
