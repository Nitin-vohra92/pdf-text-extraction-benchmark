Long-time asymptotics for fully nonlinear homogeneous parabolic equations

Introduction and main results

The connection between the scaling invariance of the mathematical expressions for certain physical laws and the asymptotic behavior of physical phenomena is of fundamental importance to the study of mechanics. In this work, we have in mind the study of self-similar solutions of diffusion equations and their relationship to the long-time behavior of solutions to the Cauchy problem. A classical example is the heat equation

[formula]

which is invariant with respect to any scaling [formula], with σ  >  0. It is well-known that a solution u(x,t) of equation [\eqref=eq:heatequation] with nonnegative and integrable initial data will converge in a certain sense to a multiple of the Gaussian kernel Precisely, the rescaled solutions [formula] will converge locally uniformly to CΦ(x,t), where the constant C is given by The Gaussian kernel Φ satisfies the relation and for this reason Φ is called a self-similar solution of [\eqref=eq:heatequation].

Another important example of a diffusion equation is the generalized porous medium equation

[formula]

where Ψ is an increasing function of u. The study of self-similar solutions of [\eqref=eq:porous-medium-equation] and the long-time asymptotics of solutions to the Cauchy problem is well-developed, particularly in the case that Ψ(u)  =  um for m > 1. It originated with the celebrated work of Barenblatt, Zel'dovich, and Kompaneets, and was later developed Friedman, Kamin, Vázquez, and others (see Vázquez [\cite=Vazquez:Book] for a well-written introduction to the subject as well as a comprehensive list of references).

While the literature on self-similar solutions and asymptotics of diffusion equations is vast, relatively little is known in the case of the fully nonlinear parabolic equation

[formula]

Here F is a positively homogeneous, uniformly elliptic operator. Important examples of [\eqref=eq:fully-nonlinear-parabolic] include the parabolic Bellman and parabolic Isaacs equations, which arise in the theory of stochastic optimal control and stochastic differential games, respectively. In the article, we show that equation [\eqref=eq:fully-nonlinear-parabolic] possesses a unique positive and negative self-similar solution, and that these self-similar solutions characterize the long-time asymptotic behavior of solutions of the Cauchy problem with initial data which does not change sign.

Assume that F satisfies [\eqref=eq:Felliptic] and [\eqref=eq:Fhomogeneous], below. Then there exist unique constants α+  =  α+(F) > 0 and α-  =  α-(F)  >  0, for which the uniformly parabolic equation [\eqref=eq:fully-nonlinear-parabolic] possesses solutions Φ+  >  0 and Φ-  <  0, satisfying the relations for all σ  >  0, and such that for some constants C,a > 0, Moreover, the solutions Φ+ and Φ- are unique up to multiplication by a positive constant.

We call the numbers α+ and α- the positive and negative anomalous exponents of the operator F, respectively. In contrast to the case of a linear parabolic equation, α±  ≠  n / 2 and α+  ≠  α-, in general. We will see in Section [\ref=sec:existence] that they are the principal half-eigenvalues of an elliptic operator in [formula]. The functions Φ+(  ·  ,1) and Φ-(  ·  ,1) are the corresponding principal half-eigenfunctions.

Our second main result characterizes the long-time behavior of solutions of equation [\eqref=eq:fully-nonlinear-parabolic] with initial data which does not change sign and exhibits sufficient decay at infinity.

Let the hypotheses of Theorem [\ref=thm:existence-self-similar-solutions] be in force, and consider a viscosity solution [formula] of the uniformly parabolic equation [\eqref=eq:fully-nonlinear-parabolic] such that |u(x,0)|  ≤  C0 exp ( - B|x|2) for some constants B,C0 > 0. If u(  ·  ,0)  ≥  0 and [formula], then there exists a constant C*  >  0 such that the rescaled solutions given by converge locally uniformly in [formula] as σ  →    ∞   to the function C*Φ+. Likewise, if u(  ·  ,0)  ≤  0, [formula], then there exists a constant C*  >  0 such that the functions converge locally uniformly to C*Φ- as σ  →    ∞  .

The Barenblatt equation of elasto-plastic filtration

[formula]

where 0  <  γ  <  1, is a particular example of a fully nonlinear parabolic equation of the form [\eqref=eq:fully-nonlinear-parabolic]. It arises in filtration theory as a model for an elastic fluid flowing through an irreversibly deformable elasto-plastic porous medium (see Barenblatt, Entov, and Ryzhik [\cite=Barenblatt:Book:1990]). Kamin, Peletier and Vázquez [\cite=Kamin:1991] proved Theorems [\ref=thm:existence-self-similar-solutions] and [\ref=thm:convergence-self-similar-solutions] for equation [\eqref=eq:Barenblatt], using different methods from those employed in this paper. Their argument makes use of the rotational invariance of the equation to reduce the problem to an ODE. The authors then employ a shooting argument in the phase plane to demonstrate the existence of self-similar solutions of equation [\eqref=eq:Barenblatt]. Their proof of the asymptotic convergence of rescaled solutions of the Cauchy problem to a multiple of the self-similar solution relies on a careful analysis of the self-similar solution at infinity. These estimates also rely on ODE theory in a crucial way, and in particular some clever applications of l'Hôpital's rule.

Our proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:convergence-self-similar-solutions] employs the "four-step method" of Kamin and Vázquez [\cite=Kamin:1988] in a new setting. The idea is to squeeze the rescaled functions uσ between two multiples of the self-similar solution Φ±, and to show that the gap between them must vanish asymptotically. Similar to [\cite=Kamin:1991], the primary difficulty in carrying out this analysis is controlling the behavior of the solutions as t- 1 / 2|x|  →    ∞  . This is overcome by the construction of a special comparison function.

Self-similar solutions of equation [\eqref=eq:Barenblatt] have also been considered by Caffarelli and Stefanelli [\cite=Caffarelli:2008], and the dependence of the anomalous exponents on the parameter γ has been examined by Goldenfeld, Martin, Oono, and Liu [\cite=Goldenfeld:1990] as well as Aronson and Vázquez [\cite=Aronson:1995]. We also wish to mention the interesting work of Hulshof and Vázquez [\cite=Hulshof:1996], who studied the long-time asymptotic behavior of viscosity solutions of an equation similar to [\eqref=eq:Barenblatt], but with Δ(um) replacing both instances of Δu.

As we were completing a final revision of this paper for publication, we became aware of a new preprint by Meneses and Quaas [\cite=Quaas:preprint] in which the existence assertions of Theorem [\ref=thm:existence-self-similar-solutions] are also obtained.

In Section [\ref=sec:notation] we state our hypotheses and recall the definition of a viscosity solution. Section [\ref=sec:existence] contains the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:existence-self-similar-solutions], and in Section [\ref=sec:asymptotics] we prove Theorem [\ref=thm:convergence-self-similar-solutions].

Notation and Hypotheses

Throughout this paper, we denote (0,  ∞  ) by [formula]. The set of n-by-n real symmetric matrices is [formula]. For [formula] and 0  <  λ  ≤  Λ, define the operators where [formula] is the set of positive definite matrices with eigenvalues contained in the interval

[formula]

Existence of self-similar solutions

In this section we prove Theorem [\ref=thm:existence-self-similar-solutions]. To motivate our approach, suppose that there exists a solution Φ  >  0 of equation [\eqref=eq:fully-nonlinear-parabolic] and an exponent α  >  0 which satisfy the relation

[formula]

For t = 1 this reads

[formula]

Formally differentiate [\eqref=eq:motivation-existence] with respect to σ at σ = 1 to discover that

[formula]

Inserting [\eqref=eq:motivation-existence-1] into the PDE [\eqref=eq:fully-nonlinear-parabolic] and rearranging, we derive the equation Defining φ(y): = Φ(y,1), we see that the pair (α,φ) is a solution of the elliptic eigenvalue problem

[formula]

To prove Theorem [\ref=thm:existence-self-similar-solutions], we will reverse the calculation above. Studying the elliptic eigenvalue problem [\eqref=eq:elliptic-eigenvalue-Rn], we will show that there exists α  >  0 and φ  >  0 which satisfy [\eqref=eq:elliptic-eigenvalue-Rn] and such that φ decays at a suitable rate as |y|  →    ∞  . We will then define Φ by and check that Φ is a solution of [\eqref=eq:fully-nonlinear-parabolic] which also satisfies [\eqref=eq:self-similarity-relation].

Another way to derive [\eqref=eq:elliptic-eigenvalue-Rn] is to consider the continuous rescaling of [\eqref=eq:fully-nonlinear-parabolic] given by the change of variables and then to look for a stationary solution φ(y,s)  =  φ(y). Thus the appearance of [\eqref=eq:elliptic-eigenvalue-Rn] in our context is similar to the emergence of the so-called Fokker-Planck equation in the study of self-similar solutions of the porous medium equation (see Vázquez [\cite=Vazquez:Book]). An elliptic equation similar to [\eqref=eq:elliptic-eigenvalue-Rn] also arises in the study of the self-similar solutions of the semilinear parabolic equation See the work of Peletier, Terman, and Weissler [\cite=Peletier:1986] and Haraux and Weissler [\cite=Haraux:1982].

The theory of principal eigenvalues of fully nonlinear operators goes back to the work of Lions [\cite=Lions:1983d], who used stochastic methods to study the Bellman equation in a bounded domain. Recently, several authors, including Birindelli and Demengel [\cite=Birindelli:2006] [\cite=Birindelli:2007], Ishii and Yoshimura [\cite=Ishii:preprint], and Quaas and Sirakov [\cite=Quaas:2008] have studied the principal eigenvalues of more general fully nonlinear operators in bounded domains (see also [\cite=Armstrong:2009]). Our methods in this section are similar to those in these works, although extra complications arise from the unboundedness of [formula]. The special form of [\eqref=eq:elliptic-eigenvalue-Rn], particularly the gradient term, provides us with enough compactness to overcome these obstacles.

Let [formula], r > 0, and assume that [formula] satifies

[formula]

and u(y)  ≤  Ce- a|y|p for some constants C,a > 0 and p > 1. Then there exists a constant R = R(α,Λ) > 0 such that r  ≥  R implies that u  ≤  0.

Set R: = 2(α  +  Λ + 1). A routine calculation verifies that the function φ(y): =  exp ( - |y|) satisfies

[formula]

Suppose on the contrary that there exists |y0|  >  r such that u(y0)  >  0. Let Then η  >  0, ηφ  ≥  u in [formula], and owing to the faster decay rate of u, there exists |y1|  >  r such that ηφ(y1)  =  u(y1). In particular, the map Recalling that u is a viscosity solution of [\eqref=eq:SDMP], we see that a contradiction to [\eqref=eq:SDMP-1].

The next lemma is an analogue of [\cite=Armstrong:2009], adapted to our setting. The result goes back to observations due by Berestycki, Nirenberg and Varadhan [\cite=Berestycki:1994], and earlier versions have been developed by Quaas and Sirakov [\cite=Quaas:2008], and Ishii and Yoshimura [\cite=Ishii:preprint] to study the principal half-eigenvalues of fully nonlinear elliptic operators in bounded domains. It is an important comparison tool which is essential to our analysis in this section.

Assume that [formula], f  ≥  0, and [formula] satisfy Suppose also that v > 0 and u(y)  ≤  C exp ( - a|y|p) for some p > 1 and every [formula]. Then either u  ≤  v in [formula], or [formula] for some constant t  >  1.

Let R  =  R(α,Λ) be as in Lemma [\ref=lem:SDMP]. For s  ≥  1, define ws: = u  -  sv. Then

[formula]

For any s  ≥  1 so large that ws  <  0 on R, Lemma [\ref=lem:SDMP] implies that ws  ≤  0 on [formula]. Hopf's lemma then implies that ws  <  0 in [formula]. Define Then t  ≥  1 and wt  ≤  0. If t  =  1, then u  ≤  v in [formula], and we have nothing left to show. Suppose that t  >  1. We claim that [formula]. If not, then by Hopf's lemma, wt  <  0. Select δ  >  0 so small that t  -  δ  >  1 and wt - δ  <  0 on R. Then wt - δ  <  0 on [formula], as we argued above. This contradicts the definition of t, completing the proof.

Suppose that [formula] and [formula] satisfy Suppose also that v > 0 and u(y)  ≤  C exp ( - a|y|p) for some p > 1 and every [formula]. Then either u  ≤  0 in [formula], or [formula] for some constant t  >  0.

Suppose that u(y0)  >  0 for some [formula]. Using the homogeneity of F and by multiplying u by a large positive constant, if necessary, we may assume that u(y0)  >  v(y0). According to Lemma [\ref=lem:parabolic-HCP], there exists t  >  0 such that [formula].

In our analysis, an important role with be played by the functions [formula], which we define by

For a = 1 / 4Λ, the function φa satisfies

[formula]

Likewise, for a = 1 / 4λ, the function φa satisfies

[formula]

For any a > 0, the Hessian of φa is given by and has eigenvalues (4a2|y|2  -  2a)φa(y) with multiplicity 1 and - 2aφa(y) with multiplicity n - 1. Hence Therefore, for each a > 0,

[formula]

and

[formula]

In particular, for every a  ≤  (4Λ)- 1, we have

[formula]

For a = (4Λ)- 1 we carefully check that

[formula]

Similar calculations demonstrate that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Thus for any a  ≥  (4λ)- 1, we have

[formula]

Finally, for a  =  (4λ)- 1, we calculate

[formula]

For the rest of this section, we let b denote the special constant From [\eqref=eq:pucci-bound-alpha-1] and [\eqref=eq:pucci-bound-alpha-2], we see that φb satisfies

[formula]

Define a norm [formula] on [formula] by and let X denote the Banach space Notice that convergence in X implies uniform convergence in [formula]. Define the set Notice that C is a convex subset of X.

For each v∈X such that v  ≥  0, there exists a unique solution u∈X of the equation

[formula]

Moreover, u∈C.

We will first demonstrate existence. For each R > 0, let uR be the unique solution of the Dirichlet problem Set [formula]. According to [\eqref=eq:pucci-bound-alpha-b], the function ψ: = Kφb is a supersolution of By the maximum principle, 0  ≤  uR  ≤  ψ  =  K exp ( - b|y|2) for every R > 0. Using local Cα estimates for uniformly elliptic equations (c.f. [\cite=Winter:2009]), we deduce that for each fixed R0  >  0, Extend uR to be zero outside [formula], and extract a subsequence Rj  →    ∞   such that for some function [formula]. Evidently 0  ≤  u  ≤  ψ, and thus u∈C. From the stability properties of viscosity solutions under uniform convergence, it follows that u is a solution of equation [\eqref=eq:unique-solution-allspace]. Uniqueness follows from Corollary [\ref=cor:parabolic-HCP]. Indeed, if u1,u2∈C are solutions of [\eqref=eq:unique-solution-allspace], then the function w: = u1 - u2 satisfies Comparing w with φ2b and using Corollary [\ref=cor:parabolic-HCP], we deduce that w  ≤  0 in [formula].

We denote by X+ the set Let A:X+  →  X+ be the solution operator of [\eqref=eq:unique-solution-allspace]. That is, A(v): = u, where u is the unique solution of [\eqref=eq:unique-solution-allspace]. Then [formula]. It will be convenient to use the notation Define the constant

[formula]

We call α+(F) the positive anomalous exponent of F. When there is no ambiguity, we will drop the dependence on F and write α+  =  α+(F). From Corollary [\ref=cor:parabolic-HCP] and Hopf's Lemma, it is clear that the anomalous exponent satisfies From Lemma [\ref=lem:rugged-calculations] we see that

[formula]

Moreover, if λ  ≠  Λ, then all of the inequalities in [\eqref=eq:pucci-alpha-bounds] are strict. If F and G are two uniformly elliptic, positively homogeneous operators such that F  ≤  G, then Thus from [\eqref=eq:pucci-alpha-bounds] we deduce that for every operator F satisfying [\eqref=eq:Felliptic] and [\eqref=eq:Fhomogeneous],

[formula]

We will show that α+ is an eigenvalue of the operator A, using the Leray-Schauder alternative. For the convenience of the reader, we first state this result. A proof can be found in [\cite=Granas:Book].

If Y and Z are Banach spaces, we say a (possibly nonlinear) map A:Y  →  Z is compact if, for each bounded subset B  ⊆  Y, the closure of the set {A(x):x∈B} is compact in Z.

Suppose Y is a Banach space, and C  ⊆  Y is a convex subset of Y such that 0∈C. Assume that A:C  →  C is a (possibly nonlinear) function which is compact and continuous. Then at least one of the following holds:

the set {x∈C  :  x  =  μA(x)0  <  μ  <  1} is unbounded in Y,

or

there exists x∈C for which x  =  A(x).

In order to apply Theorem [\ref=thm:leray-schauder-alt] in our setting, we must verify that the nonlinear operator A is continuous and compact.

The operator A is continuous and compact with respect to [formula].

Let {vk}k  ≥  1  ⊆  X such that [formula]. Set uk: = A(vk). Let ε  >  0 be given, and fix a large constant R > 0 to be selected below. As in the proof of Proposition [\ref=prop:unique-solution-allspace], from [\eqref=eq:pucci-bound-alpha-1] and [\eqref=eq:pucci-bound-alpha-2] we see that the function φ: = Mφb satisfies for [formula] and every k  ≥  1. It follows that uk  ≤  ψ for every k  ≥  1. Using local Cα estimates, we have Therefore, we may select a subsequence, which we also denote by k, such that Now take [formula]. Then for any y  ≥  R and k,l  ≥  1, It follows that A diagonalizing procedure now produces a subsequence of {uk} which is Cauchy in X. Therefore, A is compact.

To see that A is continuous, suppose in addition that the sequence vk converges strongly in X to a function v∈X. In particular, vk  →  v uniformly in [formula]. We can find u∈X and a subsequence ukj such that ukj  →  u in X, and hence uniformly in [formula]. By the stability properties of viscosity solutions with respect to uniform convergence, it follows that u = A(v). By uniqueness, the full sequence uk converges to u.

There exists a unique φ+∈X such that φ+(0)  =  1 and

[formula]

Moreover, [formula], and [formula] if F is concave or convex.

Select w∈C such that [formula]. We claim that for any ε  >  0,

[formula]

Indeed, for such α  ≥  0 and u∈C, we have Since [formula], if α  >  0 then [formula]. We see from definition [\eqref=eq:def-of-alpha-plus] that in this case α  ≤  α+. Obviously if α  =  0, then [formula]. Our claim [\eqref=eq:existence-claim] is confirmed.

We may now apply Theorem [\ref=thm:leray-schauder-alt] to deduce that for each ε  >  0, the set is unbounded in X. Select [formula] such that [formula]. Let [formula] such that Evidently, [formula]. Normalize by setting [formula], and notice that by the homogeneity of A, the function [formula] satisfies By the compactness of A, we may select φ+∈X, a number 0  ≤  α*  ≤  α+, and a subsequence εj  →  0, such that Since A is continuous, it follows that φ+  =  α*A(φ+). Thus φ+∈C. Clearly [formula], and thus α*  >  0. By Hopf's Lemma, φ+  >  0 in [formula].

We will now argue that α*  =  α+, and that φ+ is unique up to multiplication by a positive constant. Suppose that α  ≥  α* and [formula] are such that Then

[formula]

According to Corollary [\ref=cor:parabolic-HCP], we have [formula] for some t  >  1. This implies that α*  =  α. Recalling [\eqref=eq:def-of-alpha-plus], we see that α*  ≥  α+. Recalling that by construction α*  ≤  α+, we deduce that α*  =  α+. Moreover, we have shown that φ+ is unique up to multiplication by a positive constant.

The last statement in the proposition follows from the standard regularity theory for uniformly elliptic equations (c.f. [\cite=Caffarelli:Book] [\cite=Trudinger:1988]).

Define

[formula]

Assuming that Φ+ and φ+ are smooth, and using [\eqref=eq:eigenvalue-allspace], we easily verify that Φ+ is a solution of [\eqref=eq:fully-nonlinear-parabolic]. If Φ+ and φ+ are not smooth, our calculation can be made rigorous in the viscosity sense by the use of smooth test functions. The uniqueness of α+ and Φ+ is established by performing this computation in reverse and appealing to Proposition [\ref=prop:principal-eigenfunction-allspace]. All of the corresponding assertions regarding α- and Φ- now follow from Remark [\ref=rem:its-all-the-same].

We conclude this section with an estimate of our self-similar solution Φ+ from above and below, and an example.

For each 0  <  a  <  (4Λ)- 1, there exists a constant C > 0 such that

[formula]

Likewise, for each a  >  (4λ)- 1, there exists a constant C > 0 such that

[formula]

By construction, since φ+∈C we have that the estimate [\eqref=eq:bounded-by-gaussian-above] holds for a1  =  (8Λ)- 1. We will therefore only show [\eqref=eq:bounded-by-gaussian-below], as a similar argument obtains [\eqref=eq:bounded-by-gaussian-above] for all a1  <  (4Λ)- 1. For a  >  (4λ)- 1, by [\eqref=eq:Pucci-bound-alpha-2] we have that provided that we take r > 0 so large that Also take r > R, where [formula] is the constant in Lemma [\ref=lem:SDMP]. Let C be so large that φa  ≤  Cφ+ on Br. Then the function w: = φa  -  Cφ+ satisfies and w  ≤  0 on ∂Br. According to Lemma [\ref=lem:SDMP], the function w  ≤  0 in [formula]. That is, φa  ≤  Cφ+ in [formula].

For each 0  <  a1  <  (4Λ)- 1  ≤  (4λ)- 1  <  a2, there exists a constant C > 1 such that

[formula]

for all [formula].

Consider the case that F is convex. Then F is a supremum of a collection of linear operators Lk with constant coefficients, and each of which satisfy [\eqref=eq:Felliptic] and [\eqref=eq:Fhomogeneous]. Since α+(Lk)  =  α-(Lk)  =  n / 2 for every k, we deduce that We claim that these inequalities are strict unless F is linear. Suppose that α+(F)  =  n / 2. Let φ and φk be the functions obtained in Proposition [\ref=prop:principal-eigenfunction-allspace] for F and Lk, respectively. Notice that According to Corollary [\ref=cor:parabolic-HCP], [formula] for every k. That is, the fundamental solutions of the constant-coefficient linear parabolic operators Lk are equal. This implies that Lk = L for every k (see Friedman [\cite=Friedman:Book:1964]). Hence F = L.

In the case that F(M) depends only on the eigenvalues of M, we immediately deduce that φ+ and hence Φ+(  ·  ,t) are radial functions. This follows from the invariance of the equation under an orthogonal change of variables, and Corollary [\ref=cor:parabolic-HCP]. In particular, the self-similar solutions corresponding to the operators P+ and P- are radial.

Asymptotic convergence to self-similar solutions

In this section, we present the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:convergence-self-similar-solutions]. Owing to Remark [\ref=rem:its-all-the-same], we need only prove the first statement. For ease of notation, we write α  =  α+(F) and Φ  =  Φ+. Fix a solution u = u(x,t) of the equation

[formula]

subject to the initial condition

[formula]

We require the initial data g to be continuous, not identically zero, and to satisfy the condition for some constants B,C0 > 0. For σ  >  0, we denote For each σ  >  0, the function uσ is a solution of [\eqref=eq:PDE].

We intend to show that as the parameter σ  →    ∞  , the rescaled solutions uσ converge locally uniformly in [formula] to a positive multiple of Φ(x,t). Recall that Φ is invariant under Tσ:

[formula]

The proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:convergence-self-similar-solutions] will consist of a series of lemmas. As a preliminary step, we show that u is bounded between positive multiples of Φ, possibly shifted in time.

For each [formula] there exists a constant C  >  0, depending only on C0 and τ, such that

[formula]

If [formula], then according to Corollary [\ref=cor:bound-above-and-below], provided we choose c(τ)  >  0 small enough. Thus CΦ(x,τ)  ≥  g(x) for C: = C0  /  c(τ) and [formula]. The maximum principle implies that CΦ(x,t + τ)  ≥  u(x,t) for all [formula].

For each t0,τ  >  0, there exists C  >  0, depending only on B, C0, t0, and τ, such that

[formula]

By the strong maximum principle, u(x,τ)  >  0 on [formula]. Let C > 0 be so large that Applying the maximum principle, we have Φ(x,t0)  ≤  Cu(x,t0  +  τ) for all [formula], and [\eqref=eq:bound-below-initial] follows from another application of the maximum principle.

For τ  =  1 / (2λB), we use [\eqref=eq:Phi-invariant] to rewrite the inequality [\eqref=eq:bound-above-initial] in terms of uσ as

[formula]

Recalling [\eqref=eq:Phi-bound-above-and-below], we see that for some constant C(t)  >  0 depending only on a lower bound for t > 0, in addition to B and C0, we have the estimate

[formula]

According to [\eqref=eq:u-sigma-bounded-above] and local Hölder estimates for solutions of uniformly parabolic equations (see Wang [\cite=Wang:1992a]), we obtain for some 0  <  γ  <  1 and any compact parabolic domain [formula]. Therefore, for every sequence σk  →    ∞  , we may select a function [formula] and a subsequence, also denoted by σk, such that uσk  →  U locally uniformly in [formula]. By the stability of viscosity solutions with respect to uniform convergence, each such rescaled limit U is a solution of equation [\eqref=eq:PDE].

Let S denote the set of such sequential limits {U} of the family {uσ}σ  ≥  1. We will prove Theorem [\ref=thm:convergence-self-similar-solutions] by showing that S is a singleton set consisting only of a positive multiple of Φ.

There exists a positive constants C > 0 such that for all U∈S,

[formula]

From [\eqref=eq:u-sigma-bounded-above-by-Phi], we see that for each U∈S and [formula], For the other direction, fix t0,τ  >  0. According to [\eqref=eq:bound-below-initial], for each t  >  0 the inequality

[formula]

holds for all [formula] and all sufficiently large σ  ≥  1. Rewrite [\eqref=eq:convergence-squeeze-1] as Take the lim-inf of the right side as σ  →    ∞   to see that Φ(x,t)  ≤  CU(x,t) for any U∈S.

Notice that Lemma [\ref=lem:convergence-squeeze] and local Hölder estimates imply that

[formula]

for every compact subset [formula].

Define the constant

[formula]

In light of Lemma [\ref=lem:convergence-squeeze], 0  <  C*  <    ∞  . We will eventually show that [formula]. There are two basic steps in the proof. First, we will show that U  ≤  C*Φ for every U∈S. Second, we show that if [formula] for some U∈S, then we can find another function V∈S and a small number δ  >  0 such that V  ≤  (C*  -  δ)Φ, in contradiction to the definition [\eqref=eq:Cstar] of C*. Most of the subtlety in the proofs of these statements arise from difficulties in managing the "tails" of Φ. These obstructions are removed by the construction of a special subsolution, which we use as a comparison function.

For each [formula], there exists r,η > 0 and a subsolution w  =  w(y,s) of the differential inequality

[formula]

satisfying the initial conditions and such that for each R > 0 there exists a time S > 0 such that

Select a constant a  >  (4λ)- 1 and set φ(y): = φa(y)  =  e- a|y|2. Recall from [\eqref=eq:Pucci-bound-alpha] that Let β: = 1 + 2aΛn and r1: = 2(β  +  Λ + 1), and define a function [formula]. Recalling [\eqref=eq:SDMP-1] and that the minimum of supersolutions is a supersolution in the viscosity sense, we see that and Now define (y,s): = e-  βsφ(y) and (y,s): =   -  e- (β + 1)sψ(y). Then and where [formula] on r1 and [formula] on [formula]. Set Then (y,s)  ≥  δ(β + 1)e- (β + 1)s - r1 for all y∈r1 and s  ≥  0. Therefore, the function w: =   +  δ satisfies [\eqref=eq:special-subsolution].

We now investigate the set of (y,s) for which w  >  0. For every |y|  >  r1, From this expression, we observe that w(y,s)  >  0 whenever s  >  a|y|2  -  |y|  +   log δ and |y| > r1. Finally, select r > 0 large enough that r  ≥  r1 and [formula] whenever s  ≥  r. This choice of r ensures that Taking η: = δ / 2, the proof is complete.

There exist r,η  >  0 such that for any R > 0 and any subsolution u of satisfying initial conditions there exists T > 1 such that

Let r, η, and w be as in Lemma [\ref=lem:special-subsolution] for [formula]. Define Then v is a supersolution of the equation such that In particular, v  ≥  u at time t = 1 and thus v  ≥  u in [formula] by the maximum principle. According to the conclusion of Lemma [\ref=lem:special-subsolution], for each R  >  0 there exists S  >  0 such that Hence the conclusion is obtained for T  =   exp (S).

For any U∈S,

[formula]

Let r,η be as in Corollary [\ref=cor:magic] and fix a small number ε  >  0. Recalling [\eqref=eq:u-sigma-bounded-above], we may choose constants C1,a > 0 such that Set m: =  min |x|  ≤  rΦ(x,1) and select r1  ≥  r such that According to the definition [\eqref=eq:Cstar] of C*, we may select σ1  ≥  1 such that Define w: = uσ1  -  (C*  +  2ε)Φ. Then w is a subsolution of the parabolic equation and at time t = 1 the function w satisfies According to Corollary [\ref=cor:magic], for each R > 0 there exists a time T = T(R) > 1 such that This reads Thus for any σ  >  σ1,

[formula]

provided that [formula] and σt  /  σ1  ≥  T(R). In particular, for each [formula], there exists σ2  >  σ1 large enough that It follows that for any U∈S, The conclusion is obtained by sending ε  →  0.

To complete the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:convergence-self-similar-solutions], we will need elementary properties of S contained in the following two lemmas.

If U∈S, then TσU∈S for any σ  >  0.

Select a sequence σj  →    ∞   such that uσj  →  U locally uniformly in [formula]. It is easy to check that for σ̃j: = σσj, the sequence uσ̃j  →  TσU locally uniformly in [formula].

The set S is closed in the topology of local uniform convergence.

Let Uj∈S such that Uj  →  U locally uniformly in [formula]. Fix a compact subset [formula] of [formula], and select σj  →    ∞   such that It is clear that uσj converges to U as j  →    ∞  , uniformly on [formula]. Now a diagonalization argument produces a sequence σ̃j  →    ∞   for which the functions uσ̃j converge to U locally uniformly in [formula], as j  →    ∞  .

Suppose that U∈S and C > 0 are such that U  ≤  CΦ. Then either [formula] or there exists δ  >  0 and V∈S such that V  ≤  (C - δ)Φ.

Suppose that U∈S and C > 0 are such that U  ≤  CΦ, but [formula] in [formula]. By the strong maximum principle, U(x,t)  <  CΦ(x,t) for every [formula]. Let r,η  >  0 be as in Lemma [\ref=lem:special-subsolution], and choose ε  >  0 so small that Let m: =  min |x|  ≤  rΦ(x,1). Select δ  >  0 small enough that Denote by w the function which is a subsolution of the equation Moreover, and According to Corollary [\ref=cor:magic], for any R > 0 there exists T(R) > 1 such that It follows that for each [formula] there exists σ'  >  1 large enough that According to Lemma [\ref=lem:limitset-invariant], Tσ(U)∈S. Recalling [\eqref=eq:limitset-estimate], we may select [formula] such that up to a subsequence, TσU  →  V locally uniformly in [formula]. It is clear that According to Lemma [\ref=lem:limitset-closed], V∈S.

According to Lemmas [\ref=lem:Cstar-upperbound] and [\ref=lem:Cstar-lowerbound] and the definition [\eqref=eq:Cstar] of the constant C*, the function C*Φ is the only element of S. The proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:convergence-self-similar-solutions] is complete.

Let us repeat a remark made in [\cite=Kamin:1991]. If we express the constant C* obtained in Theorem [\ref=thm:convergence-self-similar-solutions] as a function of the initial data, [formula], we see immediately that a nonnegative solution u of [\eqref=eq:fully-nonlinear-parabolic] has the property that [formula] is constant. We thereby deduce a conservation law for our fully nonlinear equation, generalizing the conservation of mass in the case of a linear operator. It would be interesting to discover more information about [formula] in the general nonlinear case. What is this conserved quantity?
