Introduction

Recent remarkable results of Bourgain, Katz and Tao [\cite=BKT] on the sum-product problem in finite fields have stimulated a series of studies of finite field analogues of classical combinatorial and discrete geometry problems, see [\cite=BouGar] [\cite=CHIKR] [\cite=Dvir] [\cite=Gar] [\cite=HaIo] [\cite=HIKR] [\cite=HaIoSo] [\cite=IosKoh] [\cite=IosRud] [\cite=IoShXi] [\cite=IosSen] [\cite=KatzShen] [\cite=Shen] [\cite=Vinh1] [\cite=Vinh2] [\cite=Vinh3] [\cite=Vinh4] and references therein.

Here we extend the scope of such problems and consider the question about the largest cardinality of a set of points in the n-dimensional space over a finite field such that every triples of distinct points of this set defines an acute angle triangle. We note that a similar question in the Euclidean space Rn dates back to P. Erd os and has been studied by several authors, see [\cite=AckBen-Zw].

Certainly the notion of an acute triangle (or angle) is not immediately obvious in vector spaces over finite fields. Here we use the "rational" interpretation of trigonometry invented by Wildberger [\cite=Wild] to extend this notion to finite fields.

To motivate our definition, we note that in the triangle defined by three distinct vectors [formula], the vertex at [formula] has an acute angle if and only if

[formula]

where [formula] is the Euclidean norm of [formula].

We now identify positive elements of a finite field I Fq of q elements with quadratic residues in I Fq and say that in the triangle defined by three distinct vectors

[formula]

that the vertex at [formula] has an acute angle if any only if

[formula]

is a quadratic residue in I Fq.

Since in the field of even characteristic we always have [formula], this definition makes sense only if q is odd.

We also remark that

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the inner product of [formula]. Thus, if q is odd then [formula] if an only if [formula], which correspond to the orthogonality at [formula] and thus to the Pythagoras theorem.

Let N(n,q) be the largest possible cardinality of a set Z  ⊆  I Fq such that all triples of distinct points [formula] define acute angle triangles.

We remark that [\cite=HaIo] immediately implies that

[formula]

where the implied constant depends only on n. In general, we do not know how to improve this bound. However for n = 2 we obtain a stronger estimate.

For a sufficiently large odd q,

[formula]

Additive Character Sums

Let Ψ be the set of all additive characters of I Fq and let Ψ*  ⊂  Ψ be the set of all nonprincipal characters, see [\cite=IwKow] for basic properties of additive characters. In particular, we also recall the identity

[formula]

see [\cite=IwKow].

For an additive character ψ∈Ψ and α∈I Fq, we define the Gauss sum

[formula]

where χ is the quadratic character in I Fq (which exists since q is odd), and recall that

[formula]

for ψ∈Ψ* and α∈I F*q, see [\cite=IwKow].

Finally, given a set Z  ⊆  I Fnq, we define the triple character sum

[formula]

Although we use our result on Sψ(Z) only in the case of n = 2, here we present it in full generality as it may have some other applications.

For any ψ∈Ψ* and a set Z  ⊆  I Fnq, we have

[formula]

We have

[formula]

Hence, recalling [\eqref=eq:D_expand], we derive

[formula]

Note that since [formula], we can replace - 2 with 2. By the Cauchy inequality

[formula]

Finally, changing the order of summation, and replacing [formula] with [formula], we obtain

[formula]

By the orthogonality property of additive characters [\eqref=eq:ident], we see that the inner sum vanishes if and only if

[formula]

in which case it equals qn. Now renaming the variables [formula], we conclude the proof.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:_Main]

Assume that for set Z  ⊆  I F2q all triples of distinct vectors [formula] define acute angle triangles. Fix an arbitrary quadratic non-residue α∈I Fq. Then we see that the equation

[formula]

has at most

[formula]

solutions (which come only from the triples [formula] with [formula], that is, when [formula] or [formula]).

On the other hand, from the orthogonality property of characters [\eqref=eq:ident], we obtain

[formula]

The term corresponding to the principal character ψ  =  ψ0 is equal to [formula]. Thus, recalling [\eqref=eq:Gauss], we obtain

[formula]

where

[formula]

Now, by the Cauchy inequality

[formula]

Thus using Lemma [\ref=lem:_S_sum] and then exteding the summation to all ψ∈Ψ, we deduce

[formula]

Changing the order of summation and using [\eqref=eq:ident] again, we obtain

[formula]

where W is the number of solutions to the system of equations

[formula]

in [formula], which is the same as the number of solutions to the equation

[formula]

in [formula]. Clearly, when [formula] and one component of [formula] are fixed, we obtain a nontrivial quadratic equation over I Fq for the other component of [formula]. Therefore

[formula]

Substituting in [\eqref=eq:R_and_W], we obtain

[formula]

In turn, inserting this estimate in [\eqref=eq:T_prelim] yields

[formula]

If #  Z  <  2q4 / 3 then there is nothing to proof. Otherwise,

[formula]

thus, by [\eqref=eq:T_asymp] we obtain

[formula]

which contradicts to [\eqref=eq:T_upper], provided that q is large enough.

Remarks

Unfortunately the method of this paper, although works for any n, leads to a bound which is that same as [\eqref=eq:N_gen] for n = 3 and is even weaker than [\eqref=eq:N_gen] for n  ≥  4.

Furthermore, using the bound

[formula]

(which is immediate from Lemma [\ref=lem:_S_sum]) in the argument of the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:_Main] one can recover the bound [\eqref=eq:N_gen], but it does not seem to give anything stronger that this.

An alternative way to estimating N(n,q) is via bounds of quadratic character sums

[formula]

Using the same approach (via Cauchy inequality and extending summation over [formula] to the full space I Fnq) as in the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:_S_sum], we obtain

[formula]

It is natural to conjecture that the inner sums admits a square root estimate and thus is O(qn / 2) unless [formula] is a permutation of [formula]. One can derive that N(n,q)  =  O(qn / 2) from such a hypothetical bound. Unfortunately the highest form of the polynomial

[formula]

is singular, so known analogues of the Deligne bound for multivariate character sums, see [\cite=Katz] [\cite=Per], do not apply.

We recall that in I Rn, the largest number of vectors such that each three of them define an acute angle triangle is bounded by a function of n, see [\cite=AckBen-Zw]. Although our bounds seem to be much higher that the true order of magnitude of N(n,q), we observe that lim sup p  →    ∞N(n,p)  =    ∞  . Indeed, by the result of Graham and Ringrose [\cite=GrRi], there is an absolute constant C  >  0 such that for infinitely many primes p all nonnegative integers z  ≤  C log p log  log  log p are quadratic residues modulo p. Thus, for each such p and an appropriate constant c, for the set Z  ⊆  I Fp formed by vectors with conponents in the interval

[formula]

1 ≤ Δ(, , ) ≤ C log p log log log p

[formula]

lim sup > 0.
