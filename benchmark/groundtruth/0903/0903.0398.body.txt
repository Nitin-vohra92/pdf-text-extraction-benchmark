On the Dynkin index of a principal [formula]-subalgebra

Introduction

The ground field [formula] is algebraically closed and of characteristic zero. Let [formula] be a simple Lie algebra over [formula]. The goal of this note is to prove a closed formula for the Dynkin index of a principal [formula]-subalgebra of [formula], see Theorem [\ref=thm:main]. The key step in the proof uses the "strange formula" of Freudenthal-de Vries. As an application, we (1) compute the Dynkin index any simple [formula]-module regarded as [formula]-module and (2) obtain an identity connecting the exponents of [formula] and the dual Coxeter numbers of both [formula] and [formula], see Section [\ref=sect:appl].

The Dynkin index of representations and subalgebras

Let [formula] be a simple finite-dimensional Lie algebra of rank n. Let [formula] be a Cartan subalgebra, and Δ the set of roots of [formula] in [formula]. Choose a set of positive roots Δ+ in Δ. Let Π be the set of simple roots and θ the highest root in Δ+. As usual, [formula]. The [formula]-span of all roots is a ([formula]-)subspace of [formula], denoted [formula]. Choose a non-degenerate invariant symmetric bilinear form [formula] on [formula] as follows. The restriction of [formula] to [formula] is non-degenerate, hence it induces the isomorphism of [formula] and [formula] and a non-degenerate bilinear form on [formula]. We require that [formula], i.e., [formula] of any long root β in Δ.

It is not hard to verify that, for the simple Lie algebra [formula], the normalised bilinear form is given by [formula], [formula]. Therefore, a more explicit expression for the Dynkin index of a representation [formula] is

[formula]

Conversely, the index of a simple subalgebra can be expressed via indices of representations. Namely,

[formula]

The denominator in the right hand side represents the index of the adjoint representation of [formula], and the numerator represents the index of the [formula]-module [formula].

The following properties easily follow from the definition: Multiplicativity: If [formula] are simple Lie algebras, then [formula]. Additivity:  [formula]. It is therefore sufficient to determine the indices for the irreducible representations.

Let [formula] be a simple finite-dimensional [formula]-module with highest weight λ. Then

[formula]

Although it is not obvious from the definition, the Dynkin index of a representation is an integer. This was proved by E.B. Dynkin [\cite=dy] using lengthy classification results. Later, he gave a better proof that is based on a topological interpretation of the index. A short algebraic proof is given in [\cite=on].

1)  Let [formula] be the simple [formula]-module of dimension d + 1. Then [formula].

2)  Recall that θ is the highset root in Δ+. By Theorem [\ref=thm:d-1952],

[formula]

Note that the value [formula] does not depend on the normalisation of the bilinear form. The integer [formula] is customary called the dual Coxeter number of [formula], and we denote it by [formula]. Thus, [formula]. In the simply-laced case, [formula]--the usual Coxeter number. For the other simple Lie algebras, we have [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula].

Andreev, Vinberg, and Elashvili applied the Dynkin index of representations to some invariant-theoretic problem [\cite=AVE]. To this end, they adjusted the index so that it does not depend on the choice of a bilinear form on [formula].

It follows that [formula]  and

[formula]

The "strange formula"

Let [formula] be the Killing form on [formula], i.e., [formula], [formula]. The induced bilinear form on [formula] (and [formula]) is denoted by 〈 , 〉. It is the so-called canonical bilinear form on [formula]. The canonical bilinear form is characterised by the following property:

[formula]

The "strange formula" of Freudenthal-de Vries (see [\cite=FdV]) is

[formula]

Using our normalisation of [formula], the "strange formula" reads

[formula]

Indeed, it is well known that [formula] (see e.g. [\cite=Cas]). Therefore, the transition factor between two forms 〈 , 〉 and [formula] (considered as forms on [formula]) equals [formula]. Using the transition factor, we can also rewrite Eq. [\eqref=eq:canon-2] in terms of [formula] :

[formula]

The index of a principal [formula]-subalgebra

If [formula] is nilpotent, then the exists a subalgebra [formula] such that [formula] and [formula] (Morozov, Jacobson). If e is a principal nilpotent element, then the corresponding [formula]-subalgebra is also called principal. (See [\cite=dy] and [\cite=ko59] for properties of principal [formula]-subalgebras.) Let [formula] be a principal [formula]-subalgebra of [formula]. In this section, we obtain a uniform expression for [formula].

Recall that Δ has at most two root lengths. Let θs denote the short dominant root in Δ+. (Hence θ  =  θs if and only if Δ is simply-laced.) Set [formula]. Along with [formula], we also consider the Langlands dual algebra [formula], which is determined by the dual root system [formula]. Since the Weyl groups of [formula] and [formula] are isomorphic, we have [formula]. However, the dual Coxeter numbers can be different (cf. [formula] and [formula]).

The half-sum of positive roots for [formula] is

[formula]

It is well-known (and easily verified) that [formula] for any γ∈Δ+. (This equality does not depend on the normalisation of a bilinear form.) It follows that [formula].

For a simple Lie algebra [formula] with the corresponding root system Δ, we have

[formula]

The equality in [\eqref=eq:ht2] is essentially equivalent to the "strange formula".

Applying Eq. [\eqref=eq:norm-2] to [formula], we obtain

[formula]

For [formula], the strange formula says that [formula]. Although the normalised bilinear forms [formula] and [formula] are proportional upon restriction to [formula], they are not equal in general. Indeed, the square of the length of a long root in [formula] with respect to [formula] equals 2r. Hence the transition factor is r and

[formula]

Then the assertion follows from [\eqref=eq:hot2] and [\eqref=eq:ro-check].

[formula].

Combining Eq. [\eqref=eq:ind-subalg], Example [\ref=ex:1](2), and Definition [\ref=def:ave] yields the following formula for the index of a simple subalgebra [formula] in [formula]:

[formula]

We use this formula with [formula]. Let h be the semisimple element of a principal [formula]-triple. Without loss of generality, we may assume that h is dominant. Then α(h) = 2 for any α∈Π. Put h̃ = h / 2. Then [formula] for any γ∈Δ and [formula] has the eigenvalues - 1,  0,  1 in [formula]. Hence

[formula]

Since [formula], the theorem follows from Proposition [\ref=prop:ht2] and Eq. [\eqref=eq:ind-s-g].

Below, we tabulate the values of index for all simple Lie algebras.

Note that the index of a principal [formula] is preserved under the unfolding procedure [formula] applied to multiply laced Dynkin diagram. Namely, [formula], where the four pairs [formula] are: [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula]. This is, of course, explained by the multiplicativity of the index of subalgebras and the fact that [formula].

Some applications

(A)  Let [formula] be an irreducible representation. Our first observation is that using Theorems [\ref=thm:d-1952] and [\ref=thm:main] we can immediately compute the Dynkin index of [formula] as [formula]-module:

[formula]

Furthermore, we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

where notation [formula] means that μ is a weight of [formula], and the sum runs over all weights according to their multiplicities. Since [formula], we finally obtain

[formula]

This can be compared with the formula of Freudenthal-de Vries (see [\cite=FdV]):

[formula]

One can verify that Eq. [\eqref=eq:vee-kvadrat] and [\eqref=eq:rho-kvadrat] agree in the simply-laced case, where ρ is proportional to [formula].

(B)  Let [formula] be the exponents of [formula]. Regarding [formula] as [formula]-module, one has [formula] [\cite=ko59]. Then using Example [\ref=ex:1](1), Eq. [\eqref=eq:ind-s-g], [\eqref=eq:D-AVE], and the additivity of the index of representations, we obtain the identity
