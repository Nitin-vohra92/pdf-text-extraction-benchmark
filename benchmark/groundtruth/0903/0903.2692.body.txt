Random Walks on Dicyclic Group

Introduction

In this paper I work out the rate of convergence of a non-symmetric random walk on the dicyclic group ([formula]) and that of its symmetric analogue on the same group. The analysis is via group representation techniques from Diaconis (1988) and closely follows the analysis of random walk on cyclic group in Chapter 3C of Diaconis. I find that while the mixing times (the time for the random walk to get "random") for the non-symmetric and the symmetric random walks on [formula] are both on the order of n2, the symmetric random walk will take approximately twice as long to get "random" as the non-symmetric walk.

[formula] and its Irreducible Representations

For integer n  ≥  1 the dicyclic group (of order 4n), [formula], has the presentation

[formula]

More concretely, [formula] is composed of 4n elements: [formula], [formula]. The multiplications are as follows (all additions in exponents are modulo 2n):

(ak)(am)  =  ak + m

(ak)(amx)  =  ak + mx

(akx)(am)  =  ak - mx

(akx)(amx)  =  ak - m + n

[formula] is the celebrity among all [formula]'s and is known as the quaternion group.

It's clear that [formula] is an Abelian subgroup of [formula] of index 2. Therefore, each irreducible representation of [formula] has dimension less than or equal to 2 (Corollary to Theorem 9 in Serre (1977)).

When n is odd, the 1-D irreducible representations of [formula] are:

ψ0(a) = 1,ψ0(x) = 1

ψ1(a) = 1,ψ1(x) =  - 1

ψ2(a) =  - 1,ψ2(x) = i

ψ3(a) =  - 1,ψ3(x) =  - i

When n is even, the 1-D irreducible representations of [formula] become:

ψ0(a) = 1,ψ0(x) = 1

ψ1(a) = 1,ψ1(x) =  - 1

ψ2(a) =  - 1,ψ2(x) = 1

ψ3(a) =  - 1,ψ3(x) =  - 1

One can work out 1-D representation ψ using the identity ψ(axa) = ψ(x), and thus ψ(a) =   ±  1. If n is even, this means ψ(x2)  =  ψ(an)  =  1, thus ψ(x)  =    ±  1 as well. When n is odd, we can have ψ(an)  =   - 1, so ψ(x) can be ±  i. This explains the difference in 1-D representations when n is even or odd.

The 2-D irreducible representations of [formula] are:

[formula]

where 1  ≤  r  ≤  n - 1 and ω  =  eπi / n. One can easily check that these representations are all distinct and irreducible (by checking their characters), and that indeed we have ρr(xax- 1)  =  ρr(a- 1), ρr(x2) = ρr(an), and ρr(a2n) = ρr(1).

Clearly, all [formula] are unitary representations (conjugate transposes being their inverses). They are all of the possible irreducible representations of [formula], because 4  +  4(n - 1)  =  4n, which is the order of [formula].

An Asymmetric Random Walk on [formula]

In this and next section, we will assume that n is odd.

Let Q(a)  =  Q(x)  =  1 / 2 (Q(s)  =  0 for other [formula]), and consider the non-symmetric random walk generated on [formula] by Q: the probability of going from s to t is Q(ts- 1), [formula]. Clearly, the uniform distribution on [formula], U(s) = 1 / 4n, [formula], is a stationary distribution of random walk Q. In fact, it is the only one, as Q is irreducible and aperiodic: Q being irreducible is clear; aperiodicity of Q follows from identities a2n = 1 and an + 1xax  =  1, and the following lemma:

If n is odd, the greatest common divisor of 2n and n + 4 is 1.

Suppose integer k  ≥  1 divides both 2n and n + 4.

If k divides n, then this together with k dividing n + 4 implies that k divides 4 as well, i.e.  k  =  1,2, or 4; since n is odd, this means that k = 1.

If k does not divide n, then k dividing 2n implies that 2 divides k; but this together with k dividing n + 4 implies that 2 divides n; thus we can't have k not dividing n.

We are interested in how "well mixed" (or "random") the random walk Q is after k steps, i.e. the total variation distance to the uniform distribution U(s)  =  1 / 4n, [formula]:

[formula]

where Q* k is the k-th convolution of Q with itself: Q* 1 = Q, and [formula] for [formula] and k  ≥  2.

Upper Bound

Our upper bound on the distance to stationarity (Equation [\ref=tv]) comes from Lemma 1 of Diaconis (1988), Chapter 3B:

For any probability measure P on a finite group G,

[formula]

where U(s)  =  1 / |G|, the summation is over all non-trivial unitary (* here refers to conjugate transpose) irreducible representations of G, dρ is the degree of the representation ρ, and [formula] is the Fourier transform of P at the representation ρ.

Specializing to [formula] and P = Q* k, we get that

[formula]

where ψi and ρr are listed in the previous section.

For ψi, we find that (ψ1)k((ψ1)k)*  =  0 and (ψ2)k((ψ2)k)*  =  (ψ3)k((ψ3)k)*  =  2- k.

For odd r such that 1  ≤  r  ≤  n - 1, we have

[formula]

As a result,

[formula]

holds for r odd, 1  ≤  r  ≤  n - 1.

For even r, we use the diagonalization (recall that ω  =  eπi / n)

[formula]

so that

[formula]

and therefore, for r even, 1  ≤  r  ≤  n - 1,

[formula]

Plug these into ([\ref=upperbound]), we have:

[formula]

We need to bound the second term on the right hand side. First notice that

[formula]

We then can use cos (x)  ≤  e- x2 / 2, for x∈[0,π  /  2], (see Appendix for derivations of this and other cosine inequalities used in the paper) to get, for k  ≥  2:

[formula]

Therefore, our upper bound is, for odd n and k  ≥  2,

[formula]

Lower Bound

One can easily show that for any two probability measures P1 and P2 on a finite set X,

[formula]

where [formula], and likewise for P2(f).

For any finite group G, the uniform distribution on G, U(s)  =  1 / |G|, enjoys the property that Û(ρ)  =  0 for any non-trivial irreducible representation ρ of G (Exercise 3 of Chapter 2B in Diaconis (1988)).

Let [formula] for [formula], where 1  ≤  r  ≤  n - 1 and ρr is as in Equation [\ref=2drep], we check that f(s) is a real number and that |f(s)|  ≤  1, for all [formula]; and [formula]. Therefore, we have

[formula]

Using the diagolization in Equation [\ref=diag1], we have for even r such that 1  ≤  r  ≤  n - 1, We can let r = n - 1, and get for n  ≥  7, by the inequality e- x2 / 2 - x4 / 12 - 17x5 / 120  ≤   cos (x) for 0  ≤  x  ≤  1 / 2.

We summarize the results of this section in the following theorem:

Fix the probability measure Q on [formula] such that Q(a) = Q(x) = 1 / 2.

For any odd n  ≥  1 and any k  ≥  2, we have

[formula]

For any odd n  ≥  7 and any k  ≥  1, we have

[formula]

A Symmetric Random Walk on [formula]

We now consider the symmetrization of the previous random walk: let Q be such that Q(a) = Q(a2n - 1) = Q(x) = Q(anx) = 1 / 4 (Q(s)  =  0 for other [formula]); and Q(ts- 1) is still the probability of going from s to t, [formula]. As before, we assume that n is odd. Clearly, the uniform distribution U(s) = 1 / 4n, [formula], is still the unique stationary distribution of this new random walk Q. And as before, we are interested in bounding Equation [\ref=tv].

Upper Bound

We first note that Inequality [\ref=upperbound] still holds for our new Q.

Now, we have (ψ1)k((ψ1)k)* = 0, and (ψ2)k((ψ2)k)*  =  (ψ3)k((ψ3)k)*  =  1 / 4k.

For 1  ≤  r  ≤  n - 1,

Thus, for odd r, 1  ≤  r  ≤  n - 1,

For even r, 1  ≤  r  ≤  n - 1, we have the diagonalization

[formula]

Thus, for even r, 1  ≤  r  ≤  n - 1,

Inequality [\ref=upperbound] therefore translates to

[formula]

The second term in the right hand side is easily bounded:

[formula]

And for the third term,

[formula]

where we used the inequality (1 +  cos x) / 2  ≤  e- x2 / 4 for all x∈[0,π].

Collecting the terms together, we have,

Lower Bound

Inequality [\ref=lowerbound] is valid for our new Q as well. Using the diagonalization in ([\ref=diag2]) for ρn - 1 (assuming that n > 1), Inequality [\ref=lowerbound] implies that

[formula]

for n  ≥  7; in the last time we used the inequality e- x2 / 4 - x4 / 96 - x5 / 400  ≤  ( cos x + 1) / 2 for x∈[0,1  /  2].

Therefore, we arrive at

Fix the probability measure Q on [formula] such that Q(a) = Q(a2n - 1) = Q(x) = Q(anx) = 1 / 4.

For any odd n  ≥  1 and any k  ≥  1, we have

[formula]

.

For any odd n  ≥  7 and any k  ≥  1, we have

[formula]

Comparing the bounds in Theorem [\ref=thm:nonsym] to that in Theorem [\ref=thm:sym], we conclude that the mixing time for the non-symmetric random walk is approximately half of the mixing time of the symmetric random walk. It would be interesting to give a "purely" probabilistic proof of this phenomenon.

Some Inqualities on Cosine

For x∈[0,π  /  2], cos x  ≤  e- x2 / 2.

We will show that for x∈[0,π  /  2], log ( cos x)  ≤   - x2 / 2. Clearly this is true when x = 0. And we have because [formula] for x∈[0,π  /  2].

For x∈[0,π], (1 +  cos x) / 2  ≤  e- x2 / 4.

We will show that for x∈[0,π], log ((1 +  cos x) / 2)  ≤   - x2 / 4. Clearly it holds for x  =  0. And we have because for x∈[0,π].

For x∈[0,1  /  2], e- x2 / 2 - x4 / 12 - 17x5 / 120  ≤   cos (x).

Taylor expansion of log ( cos x) around 0 gives for any 0  <  x  ≤  1 / 2: where 0  <  x'  <  x and

[formula]

is the fifth derivative of log ( cos x). Clearly, |f(x')|  ≤  |f(1 / 2)|  ≤  17; thus

For x∈[0,1  /  2], e- x2 / 4 - x4 / 96 - x5 / 400  ≤  ( cos x + 1) / 2.

Taylor expansion of log (( cos x + 1) / 2) around 0 gives for any 0  <  x  ≤  1 / 2: where 0  <  x'  <  x and

[formula]

is the fifth derivative of log (( cos x + 1) / 2).

Since the derivative of f,

[formula]

for all 0  ≤  z  ≤  1 / 2, we conclude that f(z) < 0 and |f(x')|  ≤  |f(1 / 2)|  ≤  0.3.

Therefore,
