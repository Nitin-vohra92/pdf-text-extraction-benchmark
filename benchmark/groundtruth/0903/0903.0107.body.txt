Introduction

Let [formula] be n points on the (d - 1)-dimensional sphere Sd - 1. We assume that n, d, and the points themselves depend on an implicit parameter, so that d  →    ∞  , n  →    ∞  . Consider the normalised projections [formula] of the points onto a random direction U on the sphere.

Fix [formula], and denote

[formula]

This is a point process, i.e. a random locally finite integer-valued Borel measure on [formula]. The (homogeneous) Poisson process with intensity λ (λ  >  0) is a point process η such that

[formula]

for any Borel set [formula]. The reader may find further properties of Poisson point processes in the book of Reiss [\cite=R].

That is, the random variables [formula] behave locally as independent samples from the Gaussian distribution.

Proof of Theorem

The proof is based on the following elementary (and well-known) lemma, sometimes referred to as Archimedes' theorem. The lemma follows from the fact (discovered by Archimedes for d  =  3) that the projection of the uniform measure on Sd - 1 onto a (d - 2)-dimensional subspace is the uniform measure on the unit ball of this subspace.

Let [formula] be pairwise distinct points on the sphere Sd - 1, k  ≤  d - 2. The projections [formula] of yj on a random direction have joint density

[formula]

where Mjj'  =  〈yj,yj'〉.

Let [formula], and fix [formula]. Denote by NI the number of points of ξa in I, NI  =  ξa(I). Let us show that NI converges in distribution to the Poisson law.

Step 1: First, let us assume that

[formula]

Then proceed as follows:

[formula]

Denote [formula], and let Mss'  =  〈xjs,xjs'〉. According to Lemma [\ref=lemma], the joint density of [formula] is equal to

[formula]

Now, according to ([\ref=eq:str]), [formula], where the o(1) term tends to zero entry-wise and hence also in norm (recall that k is fixed). Thus

[formula]

where the o(1) term is uniform in h. Recalling that d  →    ∞   (whereas k is fixed), we see that

[formula]

uniformly on compact subsets of [formula]. Therefore

[formula]

where γ  =  N(0,1) is the standard Gaussian measure. The set I is bounded and fixed, whereas n  →    ∞  , hence

[formula]

Returning to ([\ref=eq:1]), we deduce:

[formula]

That is, the factorial moments of NI tend to those of the Poisson distribution [formula]. The Poisson distribution has (better than) exponential tails, thus NI converges in distribution to [formula].

Step 2: Now let us relax the assumption ([\ref=eq:str]). First, ([\ref=eq:0'']) implies that one can choose ε  →  0 so that

[formula]

Let

[formula]

[formula].

By Lemma [\ref=lemma], the joint density of [formula] is given by

[formula]

where

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

and p(h)  =  O(1)  (1  -  |〈x,x'〉|)- 1 / 2. Thus

[formula]

Also,

[formula]

According to the lemma and ([\ref=eq:0''+]), [formula], where

[formula]

Repeating the argument of Step 1, we see that the conditional distribution of NI given [formula] (the negation of A) tends to [formula]. Thus the same is true for NI itself.

Some remarks

. Diaconis and Freedman [\cite=DF] have proved the following: if, for any ε  >  0,

[formula]

then the empirical distribution

[formula]

converges (weakly, in distribution) to the standard Gaussian law. Our result can be seen as a local version of this statement.

. The conditions ([\ref=eq:df.1])-([\ref=eq:df.2]) are not sufficient for the conclusion of our theorem, as one can see from the following example:

[formula]

(where [formula] is the standard basis in [formula], and 0  <  δ  <  1 is an arbitrary constant.)

. The assumption that xj∈Sd - 1 in our theorem can be relaxed. For example, the Diaconis-Freedman assumption ([\ref=eq:df.1]) is sufficient for a  ≠  0.

. For any δ  >  0, one can construct a δ-net on Sd - 1 for which the assumption ([\ref=eq:0'']) is satisfied. Indeed, if the distribution of the points in the net is sufficiently regular,

[formula]

as d  →    ∞  .

. The theorem and the proof can be easily extended to random projections onto an r dimensional subspace, where r is any number (fixed, or slowly growing with d).

. One may ask whether it is possible to reduce the randomness in the conclusion of the theorem, and still have (at least, weak) convergence to the Poisson process. For example, one may project the point xj onto a random Bernoulli direction [formula]. Even for the points ([\ref=eq:cube]), the limit will not be Poisson, since all the projections will be integer multiples of [formula]. Instead, one can consider a random perturbed Bernoulli direction: [formula]. Is it true that the projections of the points ([\ref=eq:cube]) are asymptotically Poisson for a 'generic' perturbation ε? Is there a natural arithmetic condition on ε that ensures that the projections are asymptotically Poisson?

. It may also be interesting to consider projections of points {xj} for which the condition ([\ref=eq:0'']) is violated. Which point processes can appear in the limit, as n,d  →    ∞  ?
