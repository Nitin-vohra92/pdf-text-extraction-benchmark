Q

A spectral gap property for subgroups of finite covolume in Lie groups

Introduction

Let G a locally compact group. Recall that a unitary representation (π,H) of G almost has invariant vectors if, for every compact subset Q of G and every ε > 0, there exists a unit vector ξ∈H such that sup x∈Q||π(x)ξ  -  ξ||  <  ε. If this holds, we also say that the trivial representation 1G is weakly contained in π and write [formula]

Let H be a closed subgroup of G for which there exists a G-invariant regular Borel measure μ on G / H (see [\cite=BHV] for a criterion of the existence of such a measure). Denote by λG / H the unitary representation of G given by left translation on the Hilbert space L2(G / H,μ) of the square integrable measurable functions on the homogeneous space G / H. If μ is finite, we say that H has finite covolume in G. In this case, the space [formula] of the constant functions on G / H is contained in L2(G / H,μ) and is G-invariant as well as its orthogonal complement

[formula]

In case μ is infinite, we set L20(G / H,μ) = L2(G / H,μ).

Denote by λ0G / H the restriction of λG / H to L20(G / H,μ) (in case μ is infinite, λ0G / H  =  λG / H). We say that λG / H (or L2(G / H,μ)) has a spectral gap if λ0G / H has no almost invariant vectors. In the terminology of [\cite=Margulis], H is called weakly cocompact.

By a Lie group we mean a locally compact group G whose connected component of the identity G0 is open in G and is a real Lie group. We prove the following result which has been conjectured in [\cite=Margulis].

Let G be a Lie group and H a closed subgroup with finite covolume in G. Then the unitary representation λG / H on L2(G / H) has a spectral gap.

It is a standard fact that L2(G / H) has a spectral gap when H is cocompact in G (see [\cite=Margulis]). When G is a semisimple Lie group, Theorem [\ref=Theo1] is an easy consequence of Lemma 3 in [\cite=Bekka]. Our proof is by reduction to these two cases. The crucial tool for this reduction is Proposition (1.11) from Chapter III in [\cite=Margulis] (see Proposition [\ref=Margulis] below). From Theorem [\ref=Theo1] and again from this proposition, we obtain the following corollary.

Let G be a second countable Lie group, H a closed subgroup with finite covolume in G and σ a unitary representation of H. Let π  =  IndGHσ be the representation of G induced from σ. If 1H is not weakly contained in σ, then 1G is not weakly contained in π.

Observe that, by continuity of induction, the converse result is also true: if [formula] then [formula]

From the previous corollary we deduce a spectral gap result for some subgroups of G with infinite covolume.

Recall that a subgroup H of a topological group G is called co-amenable in G if there is a G-invariant mean on the space Cb(G / H) of bounded continuous functions on G / H. When G is locally compact, this is equivalent to [formula]; this property has been extensively studied by Eymard [\cite=Eymard] for which he refers to as the amenability of the homogeneous space G / H. Observe that a normal subgroup H in G is co-amenable in G if and only if the quotient group G / H is amenable.

Let G be a second countable Lie group and H a closed subgroup with finite covolume in G. Let L be a closed subgroup of H. Assume that L is not co-amenable in H. Then λG / L has a spectral gap.

Corollary [\ref=Cor2] is a direct consequence of Corollary [\ref=Cor1], since the representation λG / L on L2(H / L) is equivalent to the induced representation IndGHλH / L.

Here is a reformulation of the previous corollary. Let G be a Lie group and H a closed subgroup with finite covolume in G. If a subgroup L of H is co-amenable in G, then L is co-amenable in H. Observe that the converse (if L is co-amenable in H, then L is co-amenable in G) is true for any topological group G and any closed subgroup H which is co-amenable in G (see [\cite=Eymard]).

Using methods from [\cite=Leuz] (see also [\cite=Brooks2]), we obtain the following consequence for the spectral geometry of infinite coverings of locally symmetric Riemannian spaces of finite volume. Recall that a lattice in the locally compact group G is a discrete subgroup of G with finite covolume.

Let G be a semisimple Lie group with finite centre and maximal compact subgroup K and let Γ be a torsion-free lattice G. Let [formula] be a covering of the locally symmetric space [formula]. Assume that the fundamental group of [formula] is not co-amenable in Γ.

We have [formula] for the Cheeger constant [formula] of [formula]

We have [formula] where [formula] is the bottom of the L2 -spectrum of the Laplace- Beltrami operator on [formula]

There is in general no uniform bound for [formula] or [formula] for all coverings [formula]. However, it was shown in [\cite=Leuz] that, when G has Kazhdan's Property (T), such a bound exists for every locally symmetric space [formula]. Observe also that if, in the previous corollary, the fundamental group of [formula] is co-amenable in Γ and has infinite covolume, then [formula] as shown in [\cite=Brooks1].

Proofs of Theorem [\ref=Theo1] and Corollary [\ref=Cor3]

The following result of Margulis (Proposition (1.11) in Chapter III of [\cite=Margulis]) wil be crucial.

([\cite=Margulis]) Let G be a second countable locally compact group, H a closed subgroup of G, and σ a unitary representation of H. Assume that λG / H has a spectral gap and that 1H is not weakly contained in σ. Then 1G is not weakly contained in IndGHσ.

In order to reduce the proof of Theorem [\ref=Theo1] to the semisimple case, we will use several times the following proposition.

Let G a separable locally compact group and H1 and H2 be closed subgroups of G with H1  ⊂  H2 and such that G / H2 and H2 / H1 have G-invariant and H2-invariant regular Borel measures, respectively. Assume that the H2-representation λH2 / H1 on L2(H2 / H1) and that the G-representation λG / H2 on L2(G / H2) have both spectral gaps. Then the G-representation λG / H1 on L2(G / H1) has a spectral gap.

Recall that, for any closed subgroup H of G, the representation λG / H is equivalent to the representation IndGH1H induced by the identity representation 1H of H. Hence, we have, by transitivity of induction,

[formula]

We have to consider three cases:

[formula] First case: H1 has finite covolume in G, that is, H1 has finite covolume in H2 and H2 has finite covolume in G. Then

[formula]

By assumption, λ0H2 / H1 and λ0G / H2 do not weakly contain 1H2 and 1G, respectively. It follows from Proposition [\ref=Margulis] that IndGH2λ0H2 / H1 does not weakly contain 1G. Hence, λ0G / H1 does not weakly contain 1G.

[formula] Second case: H1 has finite covolume in H2 and H2 has infinite covolume in G. Then

[formula]

By assumption, λ0H2 / H1 and λG / H2 do not weakly contain 1H2 and 1G. As above, using Proposition [\ref=Margulis], we see that λG / H1 does not weakly contain 1G.

[formula] Third case: H1 has infinite covolume in H2. By assumption, λH2 / H1 does not weakly contain 1H2. By Proposition [\ref=Margulis] again, it follows that λG / H1  =  IndGH2λH2 / H1 does not weakly contain 1G. [formula]

For the reduction of the proof of Theorem [\ref=Theo1] to the case where G is second countable, we will need the following lemma.

Let G be a locally compact group and H a closed subgroup with finite covolume. The homogeneous space G / H is σ-compact.

Let μ be the G-invariant regular probability measure on the Borel subsets of G / H. Choose an increasing sequence of compact subsets Kn of G / H with lim nμ(Kn) = 1. The set [formula] has μ-measure 1 and is therefore dense in G / H. Let U be a compact neighbourhood of e in G. Then UK = G / H and [formula] is σ-compact.[formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=Theo1]

Through several steps the proof will be reduced to the case where H is a lattice in G and where G is a connected semisimple Lie group with trivial centre and without compact factors.

[formula] First step: we can assume that G is σ-compact and hence second-countable. Indeed, let p:G  →  G / H be the canonical projection. Since every compact subset of G / H is the image under p of some compact subset of G (see [\cite=BHV]), it follows from Lemma [\ref=Pro2] that there exists a σ-compact subset K of G such that p(K) = G / H. Let L be the subgroup of G generated by [formula] for a neighbourhood U of e in G. Then L is a σ-compact open subgroup of G. We show that [formula] has a finite covolume in L and that λG / H has a spectral gap if [formula] has a spectral gap.

Since LH is open in G, the homogeneous space [formula] can be identified as L-space with LH / H. Therefore [formula] has finite covolume in L. On other hand, the restriction of λG / H to L is equivalent to the L-representation [formula], since LH / H = p(L) = G / H. Hence, if [formula] has a spectral gap, then λG / H has a spectral gap.

[formula] Second step: we can assume that G is connected. Indeed, let G0 be the connected component of the identity of G. We show that [formula] has a finite covolume in G0 and that λG / H has a spectral gap if [formula] has a spectral gap.

The subgroup G0H is open in G and has finite covolume in G as it contains H. It follows that G0H has finite index in G since G / G0H is discrete. Hence λG / G0H has a spectral gap.

On the other hand, since G0H is closed in G, the homogeneous space [formula] can be identified as a G0-space with G0H / H. Therefore [formula] has finite covolume in G0. The restriction of λG0H / H to G0 is equivalent to the G0-representation [formula].

Suppose now that [formula] has a spectral gap. Then the G0H-representation λG0H / H has a spectral spectral, since [formula] as G0-representations. An application of Proposition [\ref=Pro1] with H1 = H and H2 = G0H shows that λG / H has a spectral gap. Hence, we can assume that G is connected.

[formula] Third step: we can assume that H is a lattice in G. Indeed, let H0 be the connected component of the identity of H and let NG(H0) be the normalizer of H0 in G. Observe that NG(H0) contains H. By [\cite=Wang2], NG(H0) is cocompact in G. Hence, λG / NG(H0) has a spectral gap. It follows from the previous proposition that λG / H has a spectral gap if λNG(H0) / H has a spectral gap.

On the other hand, since H0 is a normal subgroup of H, we have

[formula]

as NG(H0)-representations. Hence, λNG(H0) / H has a spectral gap if and only if [formula] has a spectral gap, where [formula] and [formula]

The second step applied to the Lie group [formula] shows that [formula] has a spectral gap if [formula] has a spectral gap. Observe that [formula] is a lattice in the connected Lie group [formula] since [formula] is discrete and since H has finite covolume in NG(H0).

This shows that we can assume that H is a lattice in the connected Lie group G.

[formula] Fourth step: we can assume that G is a connected semisimple Lie group with no compact factors. Indeed, let G = SR be a Levi decomposition of G, with R the solvable radical of G and S a semisimple subgroup. Let C be the maximal compact normal subgroup of S. It is proved in [\cite=Wang] that HCR is closed in G and that HCR / H is compact. Hence, by the previous proposition, λG / H has a spectral gap if λG / HCR has a spectral gap.

The quotient [formula] is a connected semisimple Lie group with no compact factors. Moreover, [formula] is a lattice in [formula] since [formula] is discrete and since HCR has finite covolume in G. Observe that λG / HCR is equivalent to [formula] as G-representation.

[formula] Fifth step: we can assume that G has trivial centre. Indeed, let Z be the centre of G. It is known that ZH is discrete (and hence closed) in G (see [\cite=Raghunathan]). Hence, ZH / H is finite and λZH / H has a spectal gap.

By the previous proposition, λG / H has a spectral gap if λG / ZH has a spectral gap. Now, [formula] is a connected semisimple Lie group with no compact factors and with trivial centre, [formula] is a lattice in [formula] and λG / ZH is equivalent to [formula].

[formula] Sixth step: by the previous steps, we can assume that H is a lattice in a connected semisimple Lie group G with no compact factors and with trivial centre. In this case, the claim was proved in Lemma 3 of [\cite=Bekka]. This completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=Theo1].[formula]

Proof of Corollary [\ref=Cor3]

The proof is identical with the proof of Theorems 3 and 4 in [\cite=Leuz]; we give a brief outline of the arguments. Let Λ be the fundamental group of [formula]. First, it suffices to prove Claims (i) and (ii) for G / Γ instead of [formula] (see Section 4 in [\cite=Leuz]). So we assume that [formula]

Equip G with a right invariant Riemannian metric and G / Λ with the induced Riemannian metric. Observe that G / Λ has infinite volume, since Λ is of infinite index in Γ. Claim (ii) is a consequence of (i), by Cheeger's inequality [formula] Recall that the Cheeger constant h(G / Λ) of G / Λ is the infimum over all numbers A(∂Ω) / V(Ω), where Ω is an open submanifold of G / Λ with compact closure and smooth boundary ∂Ω, and where V(Ω) and A(∂Ω) are the Lebesgue measures of Ω and ∂Ω.

To prove Claim (i), we proceed exactly as in [\cite=Leuz]. By Corollary [\ref=Cor2], there exists a compact neighbourhood H of the identity in G and a constant ε > 0 such that

[formula]

Let Ω be an open submanifold of G / Λ with compact closure and smooth boundary ∂Ω. By [\cite=Leuz], we can find an open subset [formula] of G / Λ compact closure and smooth boundary such that, for all h∈H,

[formula]

where the constant C > 0 only depends on H. Here, |h| denotes the distance dG(e,g) of h to the group unit and, for a subset S of G / Λ, Ur(S) is the tubular neighbourhood

[formula]

By Inequality ( * ), applied the characteristic function [formula] of [formula], there exists h∈H such that

[formula]

where

[formula]

One checks that X  ⊂  U|h|(∂Ω). It follows from Inequalities ( * ) and ( *  * ) that [formula] Hence, [formula] [formula]
