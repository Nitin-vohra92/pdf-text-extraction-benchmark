Quantization of non-Abelian Berry phase for time reversal invariant systems

Quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect [\cite=MNZ03] [\cite=Sin04] [\cite=KMGA04] [\cite=WKSJ04] has attracted much renewed interest in topological order in condensed matter physics, providing us with a fundamental question about its relationship with time reversal (T) symmetry. For systems with broken T symmetry such as quantum Hall effect, the quantized Hall conductance is given by the TKNN integer [\cite=TKNN82], which is known to be the first Chern number [\cite=TKNN82] [\cite=Koh85] associated with the Berry phase [\cite=Ber84] induced in the Brillouin zone [\cite=Sim83]. It reflects the nontriviality of the U(1) Berry phase along loops in the two dimensional Brillouin zone. Namely, it is the sum of winding numbers around vortices which are obstructions of the gauge-fixing of the wave functions.

On the other hand, for T invariant systems such as QSH systems, the first Chern number is always vanishing. This does not necessarily mean that T invariant insulators are topologically trivial. Recent findings are that the idea of the topological order is also crucial to the classification of T invariant insulating states. The Z2 number proposed by Kane and Mele [\cite=KanMel05a] [\cite=KanMel05b] for QSH effect [\cite=KanMel05a] [\cite=KanMel05b] [\cite=BerZha06] reveals that QSH phase is indeed a kind of topological insulator with T invariance. More generically, the Z2 number is a topological number specifying T invariant systems with T2 =  - 1, where T denotes the time reversal transformation as well.

Some aspects of the Z2 number in two dimensions (2D) have become clear and its extension to 3D has been achieved [\cite=XuMoo06] [\cite=Roy06] [\cite=SWSH06] [\cite=FuKan06] [\cite=FuKan07] [\cite=FKM07] [\cite=MooBal07] [\cite=Roy06b] [\cite=FukHat07] [\cite=LeeRyu08] [\cite=Mur07] [\cite=TFK08]. Recent success in experimental observation of evidence of the topological insulating states in HgTe [\cite=KWBetal07] and in Bi1 - xSbx [\cite=HsiQia08] [\cite=HsiXia09] [\cite=NisTas09] urges us to clarify the topological meaning of the Z2 number. Towards this direction, it seems that topological properties in higher dimensional parameter space play a crucial role [\cite=ASSS88] [\cite=QHZ08] [\cite=FFH08].

Another example of topological number for T invariant systems is the quantized Berry phase proposed by Hatsugai [\cite=Hat06]. While symmetry-broken phases are characterized by local order parameters, those without symmetry-breaking, which occur especially in low dimensions, can be classified by topological order parameters. The quantized Berry phase can serve as a local topological order parameter of gapped quantum liquids. The quantized Berry phase in [\cite=Ber84], and the use of it as a local topological order parameter [\cite=Hat06] was proposed only for T invariant systems with T2 = 1. Since it vanishes identically for T2 =  - 1 systems, the generalization of the idea to the latter case is an intriguing problem both in its own right and with a view to clarifying the topological meaning of the Z2 number.

In this paper, we propose a quantized non-Abelian Berry phase for T invariant systems with T2 =  - 1. This can be achieved by the use of the Chern-Simons five-form, which shares several important features with the Chern-Simons one-form for the conventional Berry phase. We show that it is indeed quantized into two values, and discuss the close relationship with the nonperturbative anomalies in field theories of Weyl fermions [\cite=Witten82].

We first discuss a simpler case with T  =  K, i.e., T2 = 1, where K denotes the operator of taking complex conjugate. Let H(x) be a time reversal invariant Hamiltonian, TH(x)T- 1 = H(x), where x denotes a set of parameters {xi}. In this case, Berry's gauge potential for the n multiplet ψ(x) is defined as [formula], where dx  =  dxi∂xi is the exterior derivative with respect to xi. Time reversal invariance ensures that Tψ(x) describes the same eigenstates of H(x), and hence, Berry's gauge potential for these T-transformed wave functions is given by A*. It has been shown [\cite=Hat06] that Berry phase, which is the integral of the gauge potential over a circle S1 in the space spanned by x, where [formula] is the Chern-Simons one-form, is quantized such that Ω1 = 0 or 1 / 2 (in units of 2π). This can be proved by means of the following two properties: (i) ω1 is gauge-dependent and its integral Ω1 can be defined only mod 1. In particular, since Tψ and ψ denote the same eigenstates, the difference between them is just a gauge transformation, provided that ψ is normalized. (ii) ω1 is imaginary in the following sense: ω1(A*) =  - ω1(A), which can be easily seen by noting that A is anti-Hermitian and hence, A* =  - AT. These two properties lead to the relationship Ω1 =  - Ω1 mod 1, implying that Ω1 is quantized such that Ω1 = 0, 1 / 2 mod 1 [\cite=Hat06].

Now, we would like to show that similar techniques apply to the case T2 =  - 1, and therefore, the Z2 invariant could be understood as a consequence of a quantized Berry phase. In this case, Berry's gauge potential is sp(n)-valued, as will be discussed below, and therefore, Chern-Simons one-form is identically zero. This is true for non-Abelian gauge potential belonging to semi-simple Lie algebras. In other words, the fundamental group of a gauge group G mentioned above is trivial, π1(G)=0. Therefore, the conventional Berry phase ([\ref=QuaPha1]) plays no role in the case T2 =  - 1. To circumvent the difficulty, one can utilize higher forms for the present case. Here, the property of the Chern-Simons (2n - 1)-form ([formula]) plays an important role. This tells that the Chern-Simons five-form, is also imaginary and hence, a natural candidate giving a quantized non-Abelian Berry phase. As to the gauge dependence property (i) of the five-form, we have [\cite=Zumino83] where Ag denotes the gauge transform of A, Ag = g- 1Ag + g- 1dg, Vg is a one-form defined by [formula], and α4 is a four-form defined by Here, F is the field strength 2-form defined by F = dA + A2.

These generic formulas are helpful to define a Berry phase and to show it to be quantized. Let H(x) be a time reversal invariant Hamiltonian TH(x)T- 1 = H(x), where T = iσ2K and we assume that x stands for a set of five parameters xi ([formula]), since the codimension of eigenvalue degeneracies is five [\cite=ASSS88]. Let Ψ(x) be a Kramers multiplet with 2n degenerate states Berry's gauge potential is defined by [formula], as usual. Note that the T transformation yields TΨ(x) = Ψ(x)J with [formula], where τa is the Pauli matrix operating on the space of the Kramers doublet. Then, one finds that the gauge potential A belongs to sp(n) algebra because of the relation This equation also tells that the representation of A is pseudo-real.

Since the codimension of the eigenvalue degeneracies is five, we can choose in general four dimensional sphere S4 on which there are no such dengeneracies except for the Kramers degeneracy. Inside S4, there could be a level-crossing of several Kramers doublets, which yield an Sp(n) monopole. Consequently, the gauge potential may not be well-defined globally on S4; it can only be defined on several patches: For simplicity, we assume that two hemispheres D4± with [formula] are needed, and on D4± the gauge potential is given by A±, respectively. On the overlap region D[formula]D4-, they are related each other as where h(x) denotes a transition function satisfying which, as well as the fact that h is unitary by definition, tells that h is an element of Sp(n). The universality class is specified by the winding number of h over S3, since π3(Sp(n))=Z. This winding number is nothing but the second Chern number discussed in [\cite=ASSS88]. Here, the difference of the Chern-Simons three-form ω3(A+) - ω3(A-) is relevant to the integer winding number, but each three-form never gives a quantized Berry phase.

A natural integral domain for the Berry phase may be a compact manifold with dimension equal to its codimension minus one. In the previous case with T2 = 1, the codimension of eigenvalue degeneracies is two and the Berry phase is defined over S1 as described in Eq. ([\ref=QuaPha1]), whereas in the present case, the codimension is five and integral domain may be typically S4. Therefore, the use of the five-form for a quantized Berry phase requires another degree of freedom. This feature is analogous with the non-Abelian anomalies: These anomalies appear in four-dimensional gauge theories of Weyl fermions, but their topological meaning can be revealed in five dimensions, where one extra dimension is a parameter of the gauge transformation which defines a gauge-orbit space [\cite=AlvGin84].

According to the techniques in the non-Abelian anomalies, we next introduce a one-parameter family of gauge transformations g(x,θ), where the parameter θ serves as an extra dimension. Then, provided g(x,2π) = g(x,0), we can regard the gauge transformation g as being defined on a five dimensional space S4  ×  S1. The gauge-transformed potential is denoted as A = g- 1Ag + g- 1dg, where we have extended the exterior derivative dx to d  =  dx  +  dθ. The transition function between A±, which corresponds to the gauge transform of A±, respectively, is given by [formula]. Now let us define a Berry phase which is expected to serve as a topological order for the T invariant systems with T2 =  - 1; The expression of the first term is quite formal: When one calculates this integral, one must divide S4 into the patches D4± and use well-defined gauge potential A± there, respectively. The additional second term is integrated over the boundary ∂D4+  ×  S1  =  S3  ×  S1. Therefore, this term may be interpreted as a boundary term which is necessary for the phase to be quantized. We will show in several steps that the phase Ω5 is quantized for T invariant systems in the similar manner as Ω1, and therefore, can be regarded as a non-Abelian version of Eq. ([\ref=QuaPha1]).

Firstly, it should be noted that Ω5 vanishes if g is kept strictly Sp(n)-valued [\cite=footnote]. This is not surprising, because the Chern-Simons five-form has intimate relationship with the gauge anomalies, and it is well-known that the latter vanish for pseudo-real gauge potentials. However, this never means that the present gauge potential is topologically trivial: The SU(2) anomaly [\cite=Wit83a] [\cite=Wit83b], or more generically, non-perturbative anomalies [\cite=EliNai84] cannot be described by local fields like Eq. ([\ref=QuaPha5]), but by the use of the following techniques of embedding, their topologically distinct sectors can be revealed only by local gauge fields. To be concrete, the gauge transformation g∈ Sp(n) is embedded in SU(2n + 1), and the gauge potential A is likewise [\cite=Wit83a] [\cite=Wit83b] [\cite=EliNai84]. Note here that the symmetry of the transition function h plays an important role in the classification of the universality class, so we impose the boundary condition that h̃∈ Sp(n) on S3  ×  S1 when embedding g into SU(2n + 1). This does not necessarily mean that g∈ Sp(n) on the boundary: We assume that g is factorized on the boundary S3  ×  S1 such that where h0∈ Sp(n) and g0∈ SU(2n + 1). Then, if g0 is commutative with generic Sp(n) elements, we have indeed h̃∈ Sp(n). Such g0 is given by g0 = eiθλ / 2 [\cite=footnote2], where λ∈ su(2n + 1) is The space denoted as 2n in the above is the space of Sp(n). The normalization of λ should be chosen such that h̃(x,2π) = h̃(x,0) [\cite=footnote2]. Although the symmetry group Sp(n) of the transition function is thus kept unchanged, the gauge potential itself is nontrivial even on S3  ×  S1, since it has a nonzero θ component Aθ through g- 1dθg∈ su(2n + 1).

Secondly, by making use of Eq. ([\ref=GauDep]), it turns out that Eq. ([\ref=QuaPha5]) can be written as where n(5)g is a winding number of g over S4  ×  S1 [\cite=footnote3], and the four-form α̃4 is defined by Here, the first line is the definition of [formula]. In the second line, [formula], and t.d. [formula] with some three-form β3 denotes the total divergence (exact form) which gives no contribution to Eq. ([\ref=RewQuaPha5]). The second line can be derived from a more basic decomposition formula, Eq. ([\ref=TilAlp4]) tells that α̃4 depends on the gauge potential A only through α4(Vh,A-) as well as t.d. terms, both of which vanish by the integration in Eq. ([\ref=RewQuaPha5]) [\cite=footnote4]. Therefore, we dare to suppress the irrelevant A-dependence of [formula], referring to it as [formula] for simplicity. It should be stressed that [formula] can be nonzero if and only if g depends on λ∈ su(2n + 1).

The expression ([\ref=RewQuaPha5]) is helpful to show that Ω5 is indeed topological. To see this, we note that under the variation of h or g, we have where [formula]. It should be noted that there are no terms such as Vg; g appears only through h̃∈ Sp(n). Therefore, every form V as well as the variation Δ in the above equation is strictly sp(n)-valued, and hence, it vanishes identically. The other term denoted by t.d. also vanishes due to the integration, of course. We thus conclude that δΩ5 = 0. This implies that Ω5 cannot change continuously. In Eq. ([\ref=FacG]), we have made a specific embedding of Sp(n) into SU(2n + 1), but the observation here tells that as far as one imposes the boundary condition on g such that h̃∈ Sp(n) on S3  ×  S1, one can expect that Ω5 is quantized for any other embeddings.

Finally, we show that Ω5 is indeed quantized under the present embedding such that Ω5 = 0 or 1/2 mod 1. To this end, note the following relations where the last term [formula] depends only on h̃j∈ Sp(n), and therefore, it vanishes. Applying Eq. ([\ref=TilAlp4Dec]) to Eq. ([\ref=TilAlp4]) with the assumption ([\ref=FacG]), we have Here, we have used the fact that the second term in the r.h.s. of the first line vanishes, since both h0 and g- 10hg0∈ Sp(n). It thus turns out that Ω5 is given by where n(3)h is the winding number of the transition function h over S3. This equation tells that Ω5 is quantized Ω5 = 0,1 / 2 mod 1, where mod 1 comes from n(5)g, i.e., the winding number of g which is introduced artificially as a probe of specifying the topological sector of Berry's gauge potential defined on S4. It also claims the similarities between Ω1 and Ω5: The former (the latter) is basically given by half the first (second) Chern number.

In summary, we have defined a quantized non-Abelian Berry phase for time reversal invariant systems with T2 =  - 1 by the use of the Chern-Simons five-form. Although we have concentrated on global aspects of the quantized non-Abelian Berry phase, we would like to stress here that it can also serve as a local topological order parameter. Namely, for T invariant models in any dimensions, we can compute a quantized non-Abelian Berry phase as a local order parameter by adding some suitable local perturbations [\cite=Hat06].

There still remains several important issues to be clarified. In particular, the direct relationship between Z2 number defined in 2D Brillouin zone (T2) [\cite=KanMel05a] [\cite=FuKan06] and the quantized Berry phase defined in a five dimensional parameter space (S4  ×  S1) is not yet very clear. This is mainly due to the fact that the former is inevitably calculated through the Fourier transformation which breaks time reversal symmetry in the sense that Kramers multiplet belong to opposite momentum sectors, whereas the existence of the Kramers degeneracy in the whole parameter space plays a vital role in the present formulation of the quantized Berry phase. We believe that if time reversal symmetry is broken, Sp(n) monopole would split into 2n U(1) monopoles with opposite charges, which can be detected by the Z2 number in the Brillouin zone. However, the present formulation does not directly cover the theory of the Z2 number.
