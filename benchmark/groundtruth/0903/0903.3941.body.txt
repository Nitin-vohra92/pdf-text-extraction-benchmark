Introduction

Low-mass particles neutral under the Standard Model are nearly unconstrained by existing searches. We consider low-energy collider signatures of a new O(0.1-10 GeV)-mass "dark" sector with gauge group GD and light matter charged under it. The discovery of a dark sector that extends the structure of known low-energy gauge interactions would open a new frontier for particle physics and provide a second laboratory for fundamental questions including gauge unification and supersymmetry breaking.

If GD contains an Abelian subgroup U(1)D, high-scale physics generically induces kinetic mixing between the dark U(1)D and hypercharge, as sketched in Figure [\ref=fig:twoSectors]; this mixing mediates direct production of dark-sector matter in high-luminosity scattering experiments. The decay of the dark-sector matter can lead to spectacular events with high lepton and hadron multiplicities, lepton pair masses reconstructing resonances in the dark sector, and possibly displaced vertices. In optimistic scenarios, thousands of these events could be sitting undiscovered in data collected by BaBar, BELLE, CLEO-c and KLOE. Reconstructing new resonances in these events would reveal the dynamics of the dark sector.

Evidence for a low-mass dark sector is emerging from a surprising source: accumulating hints from terrestrial and satellite dark matter experiments indicate that dark matter is not an afterthought of the Standard Model's hierarchy problem, but instead has rich dynamics of its own. The local electron/positron excesses reported by HEAT [\cite=Barwick:1997ig], PAMELA [\cite=Adriani:2008zr] [\cite=Adriani:2008zq], PPB-BETS [\cite=Torii:2008xu], ATIC [\cite=2008zzr], and others [\cite=Aguilar:2007yf] [\cite=Grimani:2002yz] are suggestive of weak-scale dark matter interacting with a new light boson, for which the U(1)D is a natural candidate if its mass is O(GeV). Dark-sector interactions can also generate the mass splittings among dark-matter states suggested by other experiments [\cite=ArkaniHamed:2008qn] [\cite=Schuster:2009]. Dark matter scattering inelastically into an excited state split by O(100 keV) can simultaneously explain the annual modulation signal reported by DAMA/NaI [\cite=Bernabei:2005hj] and DAMA/LIBRA [\cite=Bernabei:2008yi] and the null results of other direct-detection experiments [\cite=TuckerSmith:2001hy] [\cite=Chang:2008gd]. Likewise, the INTEGRAL 511 keV excess at the galactic center appears consistent with the excitation of dark matter states, but requires a slightly larger splitting of O(MeV) [\cite=Strong:2005zx] [\cite=Finkbeiner:2007kk].

The electron/positron excesses and the splittings suggested by the DAMA and INTEGRAL signals independently motivate an O(GeV)-mass dark sector. If any of these anomalies are signals of dark matter, the new dynamics required to explain them can be discovered at e+e- colliders. Among the anomalies, DAMA's signal offers the most precise predictions for e+e- collider physics: the scattering rate is sensitive to the strength of kinetic mixing between the Standard Model and the dark sector, and gives reason to expect an observable direct production cross-section for the dark sector.

Outline

In the remainder of this introduction, we further develop the motivation for a kinetically mixed light dark sector, and briefly describe the resulting events in low-energy e+e- collisions. In Section [\ref=sec:mixingIntro], we discuss the kinetic mixing that couples the Standard Model to the dark sector. In Section [\ref=sec:dmIntro], we summarize the evidence that dark matter, with a mass of 100 GeV to 1 TeV, may interact with a low-mass dark sector. In particular, we introduce two frameworks for inelastic dark matter that motivate the Higgsed and confined dark sectors considered here. Though the dark matter in each model is heavy, in either case the generation of inelastic splittings requires light matter in the dark sector that can be produced at e+e- colliders. We describe the general structure of dark-sector production events in Section [\ref=sec:eventsIntro].

We then work our way into the dark sector, and back out. Two production modes are of interest, and their cross-sections are nearly independent of the detailed structure of the dark sector. We present the production cross-sections for general parameters in Section [\ref=subsec:production], and for the parameter ranges motivated by the inelastic dark matter models in Section [\ref=sec:DAMANormalization]. In Section [\ref=sec:generalSector], we discuss the decay modes of metastable states, and the shapes of events expected within either Higgsed or confined dark sectors.

Section [\ref=sec:searches] contains a brief discussion of search regions and strategies, which synthesizes the experimental consequences of the results of Section [\ref=sec:generalSector]. Section [\ref=sec:searches] is self-contained, and readers who are not interested in the detailed decay phenomenology of different dark-sector models can skip Section [\ref=sec:generalSector], and only read this section. We conclude in Section [\ref=sec:conclusion].

Appendix [\ref=app:Contraints] reviews the existing constraints on a new U(1)D gauge boson with mass O(GeV) kinetically mixing with hypercharge. All numerical results are presented both for arbitrarily chosen fixed couplings, and for couplings normalized to the DAMA/LIBRA inelastic dark matter scattering cross-section using the prescription in Section [\ref=sec:DAMANormalization] and Appendix [\ref=app:iDMreview].

The B-factory phenomenology of pure U(1) dark sectors has been discussed in [\cite=Batell:2009yf], which notes a multi-lepton final state from a "Higgs'-strahlung" process, and the phenomenology of MeV-scale dark-matter models in which γ + e+e- or γ  +   final states dominate has been considered in [\cite=Borodatchenkova:2005ct]. The discussion of Section 3 is similar in spirit to the hadron collider phenomenology for Hidden Valleys [\cite=Strassler:2006im] [\cite=Strassler:2006qa] [\cite=Han:2007ae] [\cite=Strassler:2008bv] and the Higgsed dark-sector models discussed in [\cite=ArkaniHamed:2008qn] [\cite=ArkaniHamed:2008qp] [\cite=Baumgart:2009tn] (see also [\cite=Hambye:2008bq]). Other work that discusses new physics beyond the Standard Model leading to rare Υ decays at low-energy e+e- colliders (albeit with very low-multiplicity or even no leptons in the final state), such as Υ  →  γ  +  , Υ  →  , or Υ  →  γH (where H is a light Higgs boson), includes [\cite=Gunion:2005rw] [\cite=McElrath:2005bp] [\cite=Dermisek:2006py] [\cite=Galloway:2008yh].

U(1) Mixing with Dark Sectors

Any new Abelian gauge group U(1)D has a gauge-invariant kinetic mixing term with Standard Model hypercharge [\cite=Holdom:1986eq] [\cite=Dienes:1996zr],

[formula]

Several high-scale mechanisms, summarized below, generate εY  ~  10- 6 - 10- 2 (we note that from string theory the range for εY can be even larger [\cite=Abel:2008ai]). Therefore, the setup illustrated in Figure [\ref=fig:darkSector] is generic if there is any new gauge group containing a U(1)D factor.

The operator [\eqref=eq:mixing] is not generated at the Planck scale if U(1)Y is embedded in a Grand Unified Theory (GUT), because it is not SU(5) gauge-invariant. However, Planck-suppressed gauge-invariant operators involving GUT-breaking Higgses generate mixing

[formula]

when these Higgses obtain vacuum expectation values, where the power p depends on the representation content of the Higgses. For example, p = 1 for the operator [formula], where Φ is an SU(5) adjoint Higgs, and F5 and FD are the SU(5) and dark sector field strengths, respectively.

Kinetic mixing is also generated by heavy split multiplets charged under both U(1)D and SU(5). Integrating out these multiplets generates loop-level mixing proportional to the logarithm of mass ratios within the multiplet:

[formula]

The mass splittings can themselves be generated by either tree- or loop-level effects, leading to εY suppressed by one or two loop factors.

At low energies, the kinetic mixing can be removed by a field redefinition of AY,μ, inducing ε-suppressed couplings of the A' to electromagnetically charged states,

[formula]

where [formula] and θW is the Weinberg weak mixing angle. Therefore, a light U(1)D gauge boson can and naturally does open a path into and back out of any dark sector.

Dark Matter Motivation for a Light Sector

Searches for a GeV-mass dark sector are particularly motivated by recent evidence for electroweak-mass dark matter with non-trivial structure. The consistency of several independent observations of distinct phenomena with the same qualitative framework is striking. Moreover, if any one of these observations is found to have a non-dark-matter origin, a low-mass dark sector is still strongly motivated by the other data.

Satellite observations and terrestrial experiments provide two kinds of evidence for a low-mass dark sector:

Positron and/or electron flux measurements by PAMELA [\cite=Adriani:2008zr] [\cite=Adriani:2008zq], PPB-BETS [\cite=Torii:2008xu] and ATIC [\cite=2008zzr] point to an unknown local source of high-energy (100 GeV-TeV) electrons and positrons. If their source is dark matter annihilation or decay, synchrotron radiation from these electrons and positrons could also explain the WMAP haze near the galactic center [\cite=Finkbeiner:2003im]. Two features of these experiments are suggestive of light states coupled to dark matter:

The excess of electrons and positrons, without a visible anti-proton excess [\cite=Adriani:2008zq], suggests dominantly leptonic decay or annihilation channels. One way to assure this is if the dark matter decays or annihilates into O(GeV) particles that are kinematically forbidden from decaying to baryons [\cite=ArkaniHamed:2008qn].

If the excesses are produced by dark matter annihilation, the annihilation cross-section required to explain the signal is 10-1000 times larger than the thermal freeze-out cross-section. This can be explained by Sommerfeld enhancement of the annihilation cross-section through an O(GeV) mass force mediator at low velocities [\cite=ArkaniHamed:2008qn].

As we will discuss below, non-Abelian gauge interactions Higgsed or confined at the GeV scale can generate small mass splittings among states charged under them. Two observations suggest that dark matter may have such splittings:

The INTEGRAL telescope [\cite=Strong:2005zx] has reported a 511 keV photon signal near the galactic center, indicating a new source of ~   1-10 MeV electrons and positrons. This excess could be explained by annihilation of light O(1-10 MeV) dark matter [\cite=Boehm:2003bt], or by O(100 GeV-1 TeV) dark matter with O(MeV) excited states [\cite=Finkbeiner:2007kk]. In the latter case, dark matter excited by scattering decays back to the ground state by emitting a soft e+e- pair.

The DAMA/NaI [\cite=Bernabei:2005hj] and DAMA/LIBRA [\cite=Bernabei:2008yi] experiments have reported an annual modulation signal over nearly eleven years of operation. Modulation is expected because the Earth's velocity with respect to the dark matter halo varies as the Earth moves around the sun, and the phase of the observed modulation is consistent with this origin. A simple hypothesis that explains the spectrum and magnitude of the signal, and reconciles it with the null results of other experiments, is that dark matter-nucleus scattering is dominated by an inelastic process,

[formula]

in which the dark matter χ scatters off a nucleus N into an excited state χ* with mass splitting δ  ≈  100 keV [\cite=TuckerSmith:2001hy].

Among these hints of new dark matter interactions, the inelastic dark matter (iDM) interpretation [\cite=TuckerSmith:2001hy] of the DAMA/LIBRA signal deserves particular attention, because it is sensitive to the strength of coupling between the dark sector and the Standard Model. While the other data discussed above is consistent with extremely small kinetic mixing ε, the rate of scattering at DAMA/LIBRA fixes ε within a factor of few for fixed model parameters and A' mass, in a typical range [formula]. Therefore, the spectrum and rate of the signal reported by DAMA/LIBRA can be translated into predictions for the couplings of light states observable at e+e- colliders, as we will discuss below and in Section [\ref=sec:DAMANormalization].

We summarize here how iDM reconciles the DAMA/LIBRA signal with null results from other searches. Inelastic scattering can only occur when the center-of-mass kinetic energy of the dark-matter-nucleus system exceeds the splitting δ. This implies that for a given target nucleus mass mN and recoil energy ER, the minimum lab-frame velocity of dark matter required for inelastic scattering is

[formula]

where μ is the dark-matter-nucleus reduced mass. This energy threshold enhances the sensitivity of the DAMA/LIBRA experiment over other direct detection experiments in three ways:

Dark matter with velocity below [formula] does not scatter. This minimum velocity increases for small mN, thereby enhancing scattering off heavy nuclei such as Iodine used in DAMA/LIBRA relative to scattering off Silicon and Germanium at CDMS [\cite=Ahmed:2008eu].

Dark matter direct searches obtain the tightest bounds on elastically scattering dark matter from low-energy nuclear recoils. If dark matter scatters inelastically, low-energy recoils require higher dark matter velocity, and are suppressed -- see equation ([\ref=eq:betaMinInel]).

The fraction of the halo velocity profile that exceeds [formula] is exponentially sensitive to changes in the Earth's velocity, leading to an O(1) annual modulation of the scattering rate, in contrast to the ≃2 - 3% modulation typical of elastic scattering, which arises from the simple linear dependence of the dark matter flux on the Earth's velocity.

In this paper, we will consider dark-sector gauge groups Higgsed or confined at the GeV scale, both of which can generate O(100 keV) splittings among O(100 GeV-TeV) dark matter states, with a kinetically mixed U(1)D mediating inelastic scattering off nuclei [\cite=ArkaniHamed:2008qn] [\cite=Schuster:2009]. If the dark gauge group GD contains a Higgsed non-Abelian factor, radiative effects can split all components of matter charged under GD, with splittings

[formula]

where ΔmWD is a splitting of dark-sector gauge boson masses [\cite=ArkaniHamed:2008qn]. For example, ΔmWD  ~  mWD  ~  1 GeV and αD  ~  10- 4 gives δ  ~  100 keV.

If instead a non-Abelian factor of GD confines at a scale ΛD, a heavy-flavor meson can be cosmologically long-lived and thus a dark matter candidate [\cite=Schuster:2009]. A particularly interesting limit for inelastic dark matter is when one dark quark is heavy (mQD  ≈  mDM  ≈  (100 - 1)  ≫  ΛD), and the other light ([formula]). A cosmologically long-lived QD forms uncolored hadrons after confinement, of which the lightest, a spin-0 QDD meson, is a viable dark matter candidate. The spin-1 excited QDD meson is split by hyperfine interactions, which give

[formula]

where NC is the number of colors of GD. For example, mDM  ~  1 TeV, NC = 3, and ΛD  ~  500 MeV gives δ  ~  100 keV.

For both Higgsed and confined scenarios, the U(1)D described above in Section [\ref=sec:mixingIntro] can mediate inelastic scattering of dark matter off Standard Model nuclei, with elastic scattering naturally suppressed. These mechanisms can also generate a splitting of O(MeV) to explain the INTEGRAL excess [\cite=Finkbeiner:2007kk].

Remarkably, though the mechanisms for generating the splitting from Higgsed and confined dark sectors are quite different, both are suggestive of dark sectors with multiple new states at O(GeV) -- precisely the range accessible in a variety of low energy e+e- machines. In the Higgsed case, these states include gauge and Higgs bosons. In the confined case, these states include glueballs, light-flavor mesons, and baryons. Therefore, if either scenario is correct, experiments such as BaBar, BELLE, CLEO-c, and KLOE may be capable of discovering the kinds of spectacular events that we consider here.

We will see that the combination αDε2 / m4A', where αD = g2D / 4π, determines the DAMA/ LIBRA modulation rate. Therefore, we can use the observed modulation signal to estimate αDε2 as a function of mA', which in turn determines the expected production cross-section for U(1)D-charged matter at e+e- colliders. We discuss this estimate in Section [\ref=sec:DAMANormalization]. The expected cross-sections are O(fb) for mA'  ~   GeV. For heavier A', larger mixing parameters are required to reproduce the DAMA/LIBRA scattering rate; the resulting expected production cross-sections scale as ~  m4A'. Therefore, very large cross-sections are expected for a few-GeV A', while a dark sector with sub-GeV A' mass may evade detection in existing data.

Striking Events at B-factories

Existing B-factory datasets, containing over 1.4 ab- 1 of data altogether, are ideally suited to search for a dark U(1)D in the ~   100 MeV - 10 GeV mass range, and for any dark sectors they connect to. There are two leading production processes: an A' with mass beneath 10 GeV can be produced on-shell in association with a photon (the radiative return process). The A' initiates a cascade of dark sector decays if kinematically allowed; otherwise it decays to Standard Model fermions or hadrons. In addition, any light charged states within the dark sector can be produced through an off-shell A' carrying the full center-of-mass energy of the e+e- collision. The signatures of these processes are quite spectacular because decays or parton showers within the dark sector generate high particle multiplicities.

We focus on two cases, motivated by the dark matter models discussed in Section [\ref=sec:dmIntro]: a Higgsed dark sector containing only the non-Abelian gauge bosons and Higgses, and a confined sector with one light flavor.

In a Higgsed dark sector, the fate of the initially produced dark states is determined by spectroscopy: they decay to lower-mass states within the dark sector if such decays are kinematically accessible and allowed by symmetry. These cascades eventually produce light states that can only decay to Standard Model final states. Gauge boson decays are suppressed by two powers of the mixing parameter ε, and can be prompt or displaced. Higgs decays can be suppressed by ε4, depending on kinematics, in which case they leave the detectors before decaying to visible matter. Typical events in a Higgsed dark sector can produce between 4 and 12 Standard Model particles, with leptons being a significant fraction and easiest to observe. Caricatures of these events, with and without a recoiling photon, are shown in Figure [\ref=fig:higgsedCartoon]. The decay phenomenology is similar in hadron colliders [\cite=Strassler:2008bv] [\cite=Baumgart:2009tn], and the pure Higgsed Abelian case for B-factories has been discussed in [\cite=Batell:2009yf], though the dominant production modes and kinematics considered here are quite different.

If the non-Abelian factor of GD is confined, then the physical picture is very similar to the hidden valley models discussed in [\cite=Strassler:2006im] [\cite=Strassler:2006qa] [\cite=Han:2007ae]. U(1)D mixing mediates production of a light quark-antiquark pair in the dark sector. These states shower and hadronize, producing few dark-sector mesons with a roughly spherical distribution if the ratio [formula] is O(1), and collimated jets if this ratio is large. Unlike the Higgsed scenario, the multiplicity of mesons in a typical final state is determined by the ratio of the production energy to ΛD, not by spectroscopy. Different scenarios are caricatured in Figure [\ref=fig:confinedCartoon]. These sectors contain light mesons that can only decay to Standard Model final states. A single event can contain a combination of prompt and displaced decays, and states that escape the detector. In particular, dark pions that cannot decay within the dark sector are very long-lived because Standard Model matter is neutral under U(1)D. This is quite different from the decays of hidden-valley pions, mediated by a Z' under which Standard Model matter and hidden-valley matter are both charged. Even when all states decay promptly, the reconstructed energy may still be less than the collider energy if some of the many tracks in these events are not reconstructed. Higgsed and confined-sector decays are discussed more carefully in Section [\ref=sec:generalSector].

These considerations motivate searching for dark-sector events in several channels at e+e- colliders, as discussed in Section [\ref=sec:searches]. We will argue that six qualitatively different searches cover a wide range of possible phenomenology:

[formula] (exclusive), reconstructing Ecm (also [formula])

[formula] (exclusive), with displaced dilepton vertices (also [formula])

[formula] (inclusive), reconstructing Ecm (also + γ)

[formula] (inclusive), with displaced dilepton vertices (also + γ)

Very high track multiplicity, with many tracks consistent with leptons

γ + nothing

The combined results of searches in these regions can discover or exclude kinetically mixed dark sectors over a wide range of mass scales and couplings, including much of the parameter region motivated by inelastic dark matter.

Production Modes and Cross-Sections at e+e- Colliders

In this section, we discuss the production of dark-sector particles at e+e- colliders, with particular focus on the B-factories, BaBar and BELLE. The BaBar experiment at the SLAC National Accelerator Center collided e+e- pairs, obtaining 430 fb- 1 of integrated luminosity on the Υ(4S) resonance, at a center-of-mass energy of 10.58 GeV. The Belle experiment at the KEK laboratory in Japan obtained an integrated luminosity of 725 fb- 1 on the Υ(4S). The two experiments also acquired ~   270 fb- 1 on the Υ(3S) and Υ(2S) resonances, and at nearby energies. The ~  1.4 ab- 1 of data available to the two B-factories make these experiments ideally suited for searching for the O(GeV) dark sectors suggested by direct detection and astrophysical data.

Over a large range of parameters, the cross-sections for the production of dark-sector particles scale as

[formula]

where Ecm is the center-of-mass energy of the collider, [formula], and gD is the A' gauge coupling constant. The search sensitivity of a given e+e- machine above mass threshold scales as the ratio of integrated luminosity over squared center-of-mass energy, Lint  /  E2cm. LEPI (Ecm≃91 GeV and Lint  ~   0.5 fb- 1) and LEPII (Ecm≃ 189-209 GeV and Lint  ~   2.6 fb- 1) are much less sensitive to direct production of low-mass dark sectors than the B-factories. As we will review below, however, searches for rare decays of the Z-boson can probe some of the relevant parameter space.

Compared to B-factories, lower-energy colliders such as DAΦNE, which runs at Ecm≃mΦ≃1.02 GeV, require much lower integrated luminosity to reach similar sensitivities to sub-GeV dark sectors. For example, the ~   2.5 fb- 1 of data collected by KLOE at DAΦNE should make this experiment competitive with any B-factory searches for sub-GeV mass dark sectors, though ~  1 / 3 as many dark-sector events would be expected at DAΦNE than at BELLE. Importantly, the signatures of confined dark sector models can be quite different at Ecm  ~  10 GeV compared to Ecm  ~  1 GeV. Since there is less showering of dark sector states for lower Ecm, events at KLOE may be easier to reconstruct than B-factory events. We will nevertheless concentrate on the B-factory phenomenology in this work, with the understanding that at least part of the discussion is qualitatively unchanged for several other e+e- colliders.

In Section [\ref=subsec:production], we quantitatively discuss the production modes and cross-sections for general low-mass dark sectors coupled to the Standard Model sector via kinetic mixing. In Section [\ref=sec:DAMANormalization], we will assume that stable matter in the dark sector explains the direct detection signal reported by DAMA/LIBRA, within the framework of inelastic dark matter. Under this assumption, we will estimate the expected production rates at B-factories from the direct detection rate reported at DAMA/LIBRA. Theoretically reasonable parameter ranges permit cross-sections large enough to produce hundreds to tens of thousands of events at the B-factories.

Production Processes for Low-Mass Dark Sectors

At e+e- colliders, there are two important dark-sector production modes. For definiteness, we focus here on the production of a pair of dark fermions, but the production cross-section for a pair of dark gauge bosons in a Higgsed dark sector, which occurs through mass mixing of the A' with non-Abelian gauge bosons, is similar.

We first consider the direct production of a pair XX̄ of dark-sector fields through an off-shell A', shown in Figure [\ref=fig:diagrams](a). The cross-section for this off-shell production process is

[formula]

Here, Nc is the number of colors in the dark sector gauge group GD, Nf is the number of dark sector particles Xi coupling to A' with charges qi, and the other variables were defined in equation ([\ref=eqn:cross_section_scaling]). This cross-section is non-zero even for mA' much larger than Ecm, as long as mX  <  Ecm / 2.

The second production mode, shown in Figure [\ref=fig:diagrams](b), is that of an on-shell A' and a photon, with differential cross-section

[formula]

where θ is the angle between the beam line and the photon momentum. This has singularities as the photon becomes collinear with the initial-state electron or positron. The singularity is cut off by the electron mass, but if we demand that the photon be detected in the electromagnetic calorimeter in the range cos θ min  <   cos θ  <   cos θ max, the cross-section is

[formula]

where

[formula]

is an enhancement from the t-channel singularity (the numerical estimate is obtained from the BaBar calorimeter range in the center-of-mass frame, [formula] [\cite=Harrison:1998yr]), and we assume m2A'  ≪  E2cm in equation ([\ref=eq:onshellXsection]). The on-shell process ([\ref=eq:onshellXsection]) is enhanced by [formula] relative to the off-shell mode ([\ref=eq:off-shell]).

For mA'  ~  1 GeV, αD  =  α, and ε = 10- 3, the relevant cross-sections are O(fb) at the B-factories. With a total integrated luminosity of ~  1.4 ab- 1, this corresponds to several hundred to a few thousand dark-sector production events! In Figure [\ref=fig:BfactoryCrossSection], we show the inclusive cross-sections at the B-factories for off-shell and on-shell production of dark-sector particles as a function of either αDε2 or ε2 and mA'. Figure [\ref=fig:DaphneCrossSection] shows a similar plot for DAΦNE.

Figures [\ref=fig:BfactoryCrossSection] and [\ref=fig:DaphneCrossSection] also show constraints on the couplings of a new U(1)D mixing with hypercharge. Shown in shaded regions are constraints derived from the muon anomalous magnetic dipole moment aμ as in [\cite=Pospelov:2008zw]. The measured value of aμ is larger than the theoretically predicted value, based on e+e- annihilation to hadrons, by (302  ±  88)  ×  10- 11 [\cite=Passera:2008hj] [\cite=Bennett:2006fi], and the constraints shown assume that the contribution from loops of the A' to aμ is smaller than (302 + 5  ×  88)  ×  10- 11. This constraint is discussed in more detail in Appendix [\ref=app:Contraints].

Since any mixing between U(1)D and U(1)Y induces a coupling between Z-bosons and matter in the dark sector, decays Z  →  XX̄ are possible. Depending on the decay modes of X, which we will discuss in detail in Section [\ref=sec:generalSector], a variety of signatures are possible. For example, if the X's decay invisibly or outside the detector, the constraint is not better than the uncertainty on the width of the Z, which is about 0.1%. More exotic Z decays into multi-leptons are possible, but require dedicated searches. The best constraints on rare Z decay branching ratios are no better than the 10- 6 - 10- 5 level [\cite=Amsler:2008zzb], and even dedicated searches may not reach this level for complicated final states. In Figures [\ref=fig:BfactoryCrossSection] and [\ref=fig:DaphneCrossSection], we show (green dotted lines) the value of αDε2 corresponding to a branching ratio of Z  →  XX̄ as small as 10- 5. The potential reach of rare Z-decay searches are discussed in more detail in Appendix [\ref=app:Contraints].

Finally, we mention two collider constraints on the production cross-section which are only relevant for certain decay modes. The first one is from the CLEO collaboration which searched for decays 'Υ(1S)  →  γ + nothing' [\cite=Balest:1994ch]. This is relevant for the case when the X's are long-lived and decay outside the detector. As we will see in Sections [\ref=sec:generalSector] and [\ref=sec:searches], this is a very important search mode. Using an integrated luminosity of 48 pb- 1 of data, CLEO found no peak in the photon energy in the range 1-4.7 GeV [\cite=Balest:1994ch]. The resulting limit can be interpreted as excluding cross-sections as low as 200-500 fb, depending on the A' mass, though [\cite=Balest:1994ch] assumes a different photon angular distribution than would result from dark-sector production.

The second collider constraint comes from a search for Υ(3S)  →  γA'  →  γμ+μ- by the BaBar collaboration [\cite=Aubert:2009cp], which is only relevant if A' decays to dark-sector particles are kinematically forbidden, in which case it decays to Standard Model states. In 30 fb- 1 of data containing ~  122  ×  106 Υ(3S) events, a 90% C.L. upper limit of roughly 4  ×  10- 6 on the γμ+μ- branching fraction was found for mA' of a few hundred MeV. This search would also be sensitive to about 500 γμ+μ- events through A' / γ production. In this mass range, Br(A'  →  μ+μ-)  ≈  0.3 - 0.5 [\cite=Amsler:2008zzb]. These results exclude production of about 1000 γA' events, corresponding to a cross-section of about 30 fb. For A' masses of a few GeV, but below the τ threshold, the limits exclude 250 γμ+μ- events, but Br(A'  →  μμ)  ≈  0.2 - 0.25 so that a similar cross-section limit is obtained. We note that even if the A' is the lightest state of the dark sector, any other kinematically accessible states are pair-produced with a comparable rate through an off-shell A', which produces a signal in the multi-lepton channel (see Section [\ref=sec:generalSector]), which has much lower QED backgrounds. Lower cross-sections can thus be probed by considering different final states.

In summary, the potential search mode for rare Z decays and the aμ constraint do not exclude parameter regions in which thousands of events could be seen. Collider searches for 'γ  +  ' and γ  +  μ+μ- final states have probed some of this parameter space, but are quite model-dependent. More general final states could easily have been missed by existing searches, even if they occur with large cross-sections.

Before discussing the decay of X's in Section [\ref=sec:generalSector], we use the hypothesis that an O(100 GeV) stable particle charged under GD explains the direct detection signal reported by DAMA/LIBRA. We use this to estimate the dark sector couplings αDε2 and resulting production cross-sections of low-mass dark sector states at B-factories.

Inelastic Dark Matter and Inclusive Cross-Sections

Inelastic dark matter (iDM) can reconcile the annual modulation signal reported by the DAMA/LIBRA collaboration with the null results of other experiments [\cite=TuckerSmith:2001hy] [\cite=Chang:2008gd]. In proposals to generate the iDM splitting from new non-Abelian gauge interactions in a ~   GeV-mass dark sector, it is also natural to assume that scattering is mediated by a U(1)D gauge boson A' that mixes kinetically with the photon, with mass mA' of O(100 MeV - 10 GeV) [\cite=ArkaniHamed:2008qn]. In such models, the signal rate and spectrum reported by DAMA/LIBRA constrain the couplings of the A' to the Standard Model electromagnetic current. This allows us to estimate the inclusive cross-section for production of dark states at B-factories for a given iDM model.

At energies beneath mA', the dark matter interacts with charged matter through an effective coupling

[formula]

where [formula] is a current composed of dark sector fields, and e and gD are the photon and A' coupling strengths, respectively. The combination [formula] (αD  =  g2D / 4π) controls the scattering rate of dark matter in direct detection experiments (see Appendix [\ref=app:iDMreview]), while αDε2 determines the inclusive production cross-section at B-factories. Consequently, the production cross-section can be estimated as a function of mA'.

We will consider two classes of iDM theories -- one where the dark matter is directly charged under the U(1)D [\cite=ArkaniHamed:2008qn], and one where the dark matter is a neutral composite meson, built out of charged spin-1/2 constituents, one of which is light (~  GeV) and the other heavy (mDM  ~  100 - 1000 GeV) [\cite=Schuster:2009]. Higgsed dark sectors are an example of the first class of theories, in which the breaking of the dark gauge group generates mass splittings for the dark matter gauge eigenstates. The resulting mass eigenstates couple off-diagonally to the A', leading to inelastic scattering. The low-energy scattering matrix elements are

[formula]

where we have neglected higher order spin-dependent terms. Confined dark sectors are an example of the second class of theories, in which hyperfine interactions among the constituents split the ground state meson into a pseudo-scalar and vector [\cite=Schuster:2009]. If the [formula] coupling breaks parity, then the leading scattering operators mediate inelastic hyperfine transitions (dipole scattering) with matrix elements

[formula]

where εμ is the polarization of the outgoing χV and q = p - p' is the momentum transfer. The natural magnitude of the dipole moment [formula] GeV- 1 is the size Λ- 1D of the composite dark matter (ΛD is of order the confining scale of the dark gauge group). Relative to the charged scattering matrix element [\eqref=eq:VectorScalar], this scattering is suppressed by a q-dependent form factor.

For either current, the cross-section to scatter off of a nuclear target of mass mN and charge Z with recoil energy ER is,

[formula]

where [formula], v is the dark matter-nucleus relative velocity, and F(ER) is a nuclear form factor. As discussed in Appendix [\ref=app:iDMreview], we compute the scattering rate from equations ([\ref=eq:VectorScalar]) and ([\ref=eq:Dipole]), fit the reported DAMA/LIBRA rate, and thereby obtain an estimate for the couplings αDε2 as a function of mA'.

From equation ([\ref=eq:dSdER]), we see that the dipole scattering cross-section is a function of the momentum-dependent form factor [formula]. To estimate the coupling αDε2 for a given mA', we must thus choose a value for ΛD. ΛD can in principle be determined by fitting δ to the DAMA/LIBRA data, since δ is proportional to Λ2D  /  mDM. However, the constant of proportionality is model-dependent. Following [\cite=Schuster:2009], we introduce a scale Λ̃D, such that

[formula]

In general,

[formula]

where the first case corresponds to a heavy meson of a SU(Nc) confining at ΛD, and the second case corresponds to a meson in a weak-coupling coulomb regime with coupling α'. Λ̃D  /  ΛD is naturally a small number in either case. We absorb the uncertainty in both ΛD and [formula] in a single proportionality factor

[formula]

which is naturally small (  ~  0.01 - 1). The dark matter scattering rate is now exactly fixed by the inelastic splitting δ and [formula], allowing the determination of αDε2 from the DAMA/LIBRA scattering rate as a function of mA'. For the charged scattering [\eqref=eq:VectorScalar], there is no analogous unknown parameter, and we can solve for αDε2 directly from [\eqref=eq:dSdER].

Figure [\ref=fig:DAMANormCoupling] shows the DAMA/LIBRA-normalized couplings as a function of mA' for charged and dipole scattering, and for different dark matter masses. In Figure [\ref=fig:CompositeCrossSections], we show the B-factory cross-sections using dark sector couplings normalized for dipole scattering. In Figure [\ref=fig:ChargedCrossSections], we show cross-sections normalized using charged scattering. For mA'  ≥  100 MeV, B factory cross-sections are expected to easily exceed ~  1 fb for composite iDM theories. For theories where the iDM scattering is charged-current dominated, ~  1 fb cross-section can occur for mA'  ≥  1 GeV. In general, the estimated cross-sections scale as m4A'.

We note that the e+ and/or e- data from, for example, PAMELA, ATIC, and PPB-BETS cannot be used in the same way as the DAMA data to predict the cross-sections at low-energy e+e- colliders. The reason is that the e+ and/or e- data does not directly constrain the A' coupling with the electromagnetic current. Since the dark matter annihilates into on-shell A's that decay with a lifetime that is largely unconstrained by the data, the mixing parameter ε is also unconstrained. However, indirect constraints on the dark matter annihilation cross-section from, for example, γ-ray observations [\cite=Kamionkowski:2008gj] [\cite=Essig:2009jx] and CMB measurements [\cite=Galli:2009zc] constrain the maximum allowable Sommerfeld enhancement, and currently disfavor very low A' masses (~   100 MeV or less).

Decays of Dark-Sector States into Standard Model Particles

In this lengthy section, we discuss the decays of dark-sector states produced at e+e- colliders. Readers interested in the experimental consequences of these decays can skip to Section [\ref=sec:searches], which is self-contained.

The kinetic mixing that allows dark-sector states to be produced at e+e- colliders also allows them to decay back into Standard Model states, mainly leptons and light hadrons. To demonstrate the range of phenomenology possible in both Higgsed and confined dark sectors, we have considered several kinematic limits that exhibit different properties. We will also briefly consider the impact of Higgs mixing on decays. We organize our discussion around the following questions:

What are the metastable states of the dark sector that can only decay through processes that involve kinetic mixing?

What are the decay widths of these metastable states?

What are the multiplicities and kinematic properties of these metastable states?

We consider Higgsed dark sectors in Section [\ref=subsec:higgsedDS] and confined dark sectors in Section [\ref=subsec:confinedDS]. In both cases, decays of spin-1 states through A' mixing, suppressed by ε2, are generically prompt, while other species can have displaced 3-body decays or invisible decays suppressed by ε4. Therefore, different dark-sector spectra can give rise to very different phenomenology, with all dark-sector states decaying promptly into the standard model, all states so long-lived that they escape the detector, or a combination of prompt, displaced, and/or invisible decays. Light fermions in the dark sector lead to events with more invisible decay products, as we discuss in Section [\ref=subsec:fermions].

Through most of this discussion we consider only the decays generated by the A' / γ kinetic mixing, but other interactions between the Standard Model and dark sector, involving either Standard Model Higgs bosons or new heavy fields coupled to both sectors, are also possible. Though these have no observable effect on direct production, they can dominate over the kinetic-mixing-induced decay modes that scale as ε4. These interactions could be discovered through the observation of displaced decays that are not induced by kinetic mixing -- specifically, a two-fermion decay of spin-0 states (Section [\ref=subsubsec:higgsedDSadditionalCouplings]) and any decay of the lightest dark-sector fermion (Section [\ref=subsec:fermions]).

Events from a Higgsed Dark Sector

We assume that the dark sector gauge group GD has been completely Higgsed, giving mass to all dark-sector gauge bosons. We also assume that all custodial symmetries have been broken, so that couplings Wi  Wj  Wk, Wi  Wj  hk and Wi  hi  hj are generated between all Higgs and gauge bosons. The custodial symmetry breaking ensures that the A' mediates inelastic transitions between the dark matter and its excited states, which is needed to explain the DAMA/LIBRA and INTEGRAL signals [\cite=ArkaniHamed:2008qn] [\cite=Baumgart:2009tn]. As all mass eigenstates are mixed, we will not distinguish between the Abelian gauge boson A' and non-Abelian gauge bosons, but refer to all as WD.

The high-energy collider phenomenology of these models has been discussed in [\cite=Baumgart:2009tn], and many of the same features control low-energy collider signatures as well. The special case of a pure U(1) dark sector was recently discussed in [\cite=Batell:2009yf]. In Section [\ref=subsubsec:higgsedmeta], we determine the metastable states and their decays mediated through kinetic mixing. We discuss the final-state multiplicities in Section [\ref=subsubsec:HiggsedEventShapes]. In Section [\ref=subsubsec:higgsedDSadditionalCouplings], we comment on other interactions that induce faster decays than those mediated by kinetic mixing.

Metastable States and their Decays through Kinetic Mixing

We begin with a somewhat careful discussion of the metastable states -- those that can only decay through kinetic mixing to Standard Model states, or equivalently those whose lifetimes vanish in the ε  →  0 limit. States that can decay to final states within the dark sector are not considered metastable, and these decays are typically prompt. The Standard Model states produced in the decay of metastable states include mainly leptons and pions. We denote the mass of the lightest dark-sector gauge boson by mWD,, and the mass of the lightest Higgs by mhD,. Any Higgs heavier than 2mWD, can decay to two gauge bosons, and any WD heavier than 2mhD, can decay to two Higgses. Therefore, if mhD,  >  2mWD,, only WD's are metastable; if mWD,  >  2mhD,, then only Higgses are metastable. More than one dark gauge or Higgs boson may be metastable in each case, but they will decay similarly. If [formula], then the dark sector contains at least one metastable Higgs, and at least one metastable gauge boson.

The importance of this characterization is that the gauge and Higgs bosons have very different lifetimes: gauge bosons typically decay promptly, while Higgs decays give rise to displaced decays or escape the detector before decaying. A typical dark-sector production event will eventually decay to a collection of metastable states, consisting either of only Higgs bosons, only gauge bosons, or a combination of both. This leads to a variety of scenarios with very different decay phenomenology, summarized in Figure [\ref=fig:higgsedDecayStory]. In the following, we justify the decay properties claimed in that figure.

If WD's are metastable, they can decay to Standard Model leptons and pions through kinetic mixing. By assumption, all gauge bosons have some mixing angle θ with U(1)D, giving rise to a decay width

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the mass of a lepton or a hadron. Here Neff counts the number of available decay products: Neff  =  1 for [formula] when only WD  →  e+e- decays are possible, and 2 + R(mWD) for [formula], where R is defined to be the energy dependent ratio σ(e+e-  →  ) / σ(e+e-  →  μ+μ-) [\cite=Amsler:2008zzb].

The decay length of WD in its rest frame is given by

[formula]

and is thus prompt for θ  ~  O(1). The combination αDε2 can also be normalized to its DAMA/LIBRA expected value. In this case,

[formula]

where mDM is the mass of the dark matter (see Section [\ref=sec:DAMANormalization]). We see that prompt decays are also generic. However, due the strong dependence of cτ on 1 / m4A', displaced vertices are also possible for mA'  ~  O(100 MeV).

If Higgses are metastable, they can decay to Standard Model leptons and hadrons through one or two off-shell WD's (heavier Higgses can have 3-body decays to a lighter Higgs and [formula]). If mhD  >  mWD,, one final-state WD can be on-shell, and the lifetime is

[formula]

where we have assumed mWi = mWj for simplicity. This has the same form as the h  →  ZZ* partial width in the Standard Model. The function f3(x), [formula], is a 3-body phase space integral that can be found e.g. on page 30 in [\cite=Gunion:1989we]. The decay length in the rest frame of hD is shown in Figure [\ref=fig:higgsedDecayLifetimes] for αD  =  α and for both ε  =  10- 5 and 10- 8. From the figure, we see that hD decays can be prompt, displaced or invisible, depending on the parameters. Similarly diverse decay scenarios are also shown in Figure [\ref=fig:higgsedDecayLifetimesDAMA], where we plot the hD decay length after normalizing αDε2 to its DAMA/LIBRA expected value.

If mhD,  <  mWD,, then the lightest Higgs can only decay through two off-shell gauge bosons, which is dominated by a four-fermion final state, and is parametrically given by

[formula]

A 2-body decay to two Standard Model fermions through a one-loop diagram mediated by WD's is parametrically of the same size. Because of the strong ε4 suppression, such a light Higgs is expected to escape the detector, even for large αD. Note that in this case all but the very lightest Higgs have three-body decays to either a lighter gauge boson or a lighter Higgs, so that it is not hard to construct dark sectors in which prompt, displaced, and invisible decays all occur.

Event Shapes in a Higgsed Dark Sector

Specific choices for the structure of a Higgsed dark sector can dramatically change the typical decay chains within the sector. It is typical for dark-sector production to result in a high-multiplicity and lepton-rich final state. Here, we discuss two examples.

A four-lepton final state is expected from production of a pair of metastable WD bosons that decay directly to Standard Model fermions (Figure [\ref=fig:feynHiggsed](a)). The lepton kinematics depends on the WD masses: if [formula], then the observed leptons will lie in two approximately collinear pairs.

It is also possible to produce heavier gauge bosons that decay into a lighter W'D and hD of the dark sector, as in Figure [\ref=fig:feynHiggsed](b). One limit in which this is guaranteed is a dark sector with the structure of a charge-breaking Standard Model, with SU(2)D  ×  U(1)D' Higgsed to U(1)D at mWD and with charge (U(1)D) being broken at a lower mass scale mA'. Such models have an approximate global custodial symmetry U(1) that suppresses the charged WD's mixing with the A', so that the heavy WD bosons are produced far more efficiently than the lighter A' [\cite=Baumgart:2009tn]. In this case, a large number of leptons (and possibly pions) are expected. Likewise, it is possible to produce dark Higgs bosons directly (a special case is the "Higgs'-strahlung" discussed in [\cite=Batell:2009yf]).

Decay Modes from Additional Mixing Interactions

Additional couplings between the Standard Model and dark sector are possible, but they involve massive Standard Model-charged states and so are irrelevant to dark-sector production. They can, however, compete with the ε4-suppressed decays of any light Higgs bosons in the dark sector. For example, the mixed Higgs quartic

[formula]

leads to Higgs decay through mixing with the Standard Model Higgs. If the theory is supersymmetric at high energies, λε  ~  εggD is generated by D-term mixing [\cite=Baumgart:2009tn] [\cite=Katz:2009qq] [\cite=Cheung:2009qd]. More generally, loops of link fields charged under GD and SU(2)L  ×  U(1)Y and loops of ordinary Standard Model matter will generate a quartic Higgs mixing through their Yukawa interactions with both Higgses. A rough upper bound on the mixing,

[formula]

can be obtained by demanding that mhD receives at most O(1) corrections from this quartic term. If the U(1)D symmetry-breaking is generated by ([\ref=eq:higgsquartic]), then this limit is saturated.

When hD gets a vacuum expectation value, the quartic coupling ([\ref=eq:higgsquartic]) generates mixing between hD and hSM with angle

[formula]

where the latter limit corresponds to saturation of the bound [\eqref=eq:naturalness]. This mixing leads to a decay width

[formula]

where the final expression is again obtained by saturating [\eqref=eq:naturalness]. Assuming saturation, the decay length of hD in its rest frame is given by

[formula]

where yτ≃0.01 is the τ Yukawa coupling. This decay can thus lead to observable decays with O(cm) displacements if hD is above the τ threshold, and saturates the naturalness bound. It dominates over the three-body decay ([\ref=eq:threebody]) if [formula]. Below the τ threshold, however, it is unlikely to produce observable decays.

Events from a Confined Dark Sector

In this section, we discuss the events obtained with confined dark sectors. We begin in Section [\ref=subsec:CDSspectroscopy] with a review of the spectroscopy in confined dark sectors containing one or multiple light flavors, and discuss the shape of production events. As for the Higgsed case, the events can usefully be characterized by discussing the metastable states, i.e. those states that do not decay to other dark-sector particles. For multiple light flavors, these metastable states are either the dark-sector pions (Section [\ref=sec:twoFlavor]) or the A' (Section [\ref=sec:lightAPrimeCase]), depending on which is lighter. For a single flavor, the metastable states are either the A' (also Section [\ref=sec:lightAPrimeCase]), or the tower of mesons lighter than 2mη'D, where mη'D is the mass of the lightest meson (Section [\ref=sec:oneFlavorTower]). Likewise, the lightest baryon ΔD is exactly stable and a tower of baryons lighter than mΔD  +  mη'D can be metastable.

Preliminaries: Spectroscopy and Event Shapes

We begin by reviewing the spectra of mesons and baryons in a one-flavor model. A model with only one light flavor has no light pion; instead, the lightest meson is expected to be a pseudoscalar meson (JPC  =  0-  +), which we will call η'D in analogy with the Standard Model η'. The second-lightest meson, again named by analogy with the Standard Model, is the ωD (1-  -). Excited states and higher-spin mesons are also expected, but their spectrum is not known precisely. We will only ever be interested in the tower of mesons with mass less than 2mη'D. Mesons above this threshold can decay strongly to lighter mesons, and are quite broad. The one-flavor dark sector also contains a tower of baryons, beginning from the spin-Nc/2 ΔD, where Nc is the number of colors of the confining gauge group. For small Nc, these have comparable mass to the tower of light mesons. We expect that any metastable glueball states will mix with the mesons, and decay through this mixing.

In a model with Nf  >  1 light flavors, confinement breaks an approximate SU(Nf)L  ×  SU(Nf)R  ×  U(1) flavor symmetry to a diagonal subgroup SU(Nf)d  ×  U(1). There are then N2f - 1 light pions. All other mesons and (for Nc > 2) all baryons are parametrically heavier than the pions, and are produced much more rarely; therefore, we will focus on the pions.

The final-state kinematics and multiplicities can be estimated from those in the Standard Model by analogy with `e+e-  →   hadrons' processes and a simple rescaling of the QCD to dark-sector confining scale, or inferred from parametrizations such as the quark production rule [\cite=Xie:1988wi]. These properties depend dominantly on the ratio of the confining scale to the energy [formula] going into the confined sector ([formula] for e+e-  →   or e+e-  →  , while [formula] for the radiative return process). We will parametrize this by [formula]. Thus, for example, from low-energy SPEAR data we see that jet structure is not observable for RE  ≈  4 (3.6 GeV collisions), but is observable by RE  ≈  8 [\cite=Schwitters:1975dm].

Likewise, dark-hadron multiplicities can be estimated from QCD track multiplicities in e+e- collisions; what is measured is the charged-track multiplicities [formula], not the total hadron multiplicity, but studies of the total energy of reconstructed tracks suggest that approximately half of produced hadrons are charged [\cite=Schwitters:1975dm]. Doubling observed track multiplicities from e.g. [\cite=Abe:1996vs] [\cite=Chliapnikov:1992dk], we see that over the range of interest, hadron multiplicities range between [formula] 10 at 7.6 GeV (RE  ≈  8) to ≈  40 at 90 GeV (RE  ≈  100).

At low RE in a one-flavor model in which η'D is the lightest state, we expect [formula], so that the production of non-relativistic hadrons dominates, while the production of a much lower multiplicity of hadrons is exponentially suppressed (see e.g. [\cite=JeanMarie:1976un] for experimental evidence of this effect in QCD events with very few pions). It is difficult to make more quantitative statements in this region of parameter space based on either direct extrapolation from QCD or parametrized models. The QCD extrapolation would suggest hadron multiplicities larger than Ecm / mη'D, which are consistent in theories with light pions but unphysical if the η'D is the lightest state. Parametrizations such as the quark production rule [\cite=Xie:1988wi] can in principle be modified for the one-flavor scenario, but they deviate from experimental data precisely at small RE.

Dark Sectors with Metastable Pions

In a model with two or more flavors and a heavy A', the lightest dark-sector states are pions. Since they are then kinematically forbidden to decay into any other dark-sector states, they are metastable.

Kinetic mixing does not generate the most general decays allowed for the dark pion in an effective field theory. In particular, the helicity-suppressed decay of a "v-pion", [formula], which dominates in Hidden Valley models with a Z' that couples directly to both dark-sector and Standard Model matter, is not generated by kinetic mixing. This can be most readily seen before performing the field redefinitions that diagonalize the gauge field kinetic terms. Instead, let us treat the kinetic mixing as an insertion

[formula]

By Lorentz invariance, the pion current must have the form

[formula]

which vanishes when dotted into the kinetic mixing tensor. In other words, kinetic mixing only mixes the transverse modes of the two gauge bosons, to which the pion does not couple. The vanishing of this decay mode is obscured when the couplings are diagonalized. The A' couples to the photon current, JEM, but this vector-like current vanishes when contracted with pμ. The A' also couples to the chiral current, JZ, but this contribution is precisely canceled by the Z's coupling to the dark photon current, JA', so this also does not mediate decays.

Instead, the pion can only decay through the anomaly diagram, but with one or both A' off-shell. The resulting decay width scales as

[formula]

where p = 1 for three-body decays and p = 2 for four-body decays, and the pion decay constant fπD can be estimated by scaling the pion decay constant in the standard model, fπD = fπmη'D / mη'SM. These decay lifetimes are identical to those of the η'D in a one-flavor model, and the rest frame displacements are shown in Figure [\ref=fig:etaDecay]. If mA'  <  mπD  <  2mA', a three-body decay can give rise to displaced vertices, but this mass condition is not generic. When mA' > mπD, the four-body mode is suppressed by ε4, leading to very large displacements:

[formula]

A loop decay to two leptons is also possible, but comparable in rate to the four-body decay (in fact, it receives chiral suppression [formula] relative to the four-body decay). Therefore, in this region of parameter space the pion escapes the detector without decaying, and is invisible.

Assuming that dark-sector interactions break the dark flavor symmetries, a heavier pion that cannot decay to two lighter pions may still decay via an off-shell A' into a lighter pion and Standard Model leptons/hadrons. This decay is suppressed by αDε2, and so is typically prompt or displaced.

Dark Sectors with a Metastable Light A'

In this section, we discuss the case when the A' is the lightest state in the dark sector. We consider both a one-flavor and a multi-flavor model. In both cases, final states consisting of prompt Standard Model leptons and hadrons are likely.

A particularly simple example is the one-flavor model, in which the A' is significantly lighter than the dark mesons and the physical dark Higgs boson associated with U(1)D breaking, hD. Under this assumption, the [formula] production is important, but off-shell production of dark-sector particles gives rise to high-multiplicity final states consisting of leptons and/or Standard Model hadrons that may yield more sensitive limits.

For light A', all dark mesons and hD can decay promptly to several A''s. For example, the ηD' decays through the chiral anomaly to 2A'. We show the η'D decay length in its rest-frame in Figure [\ref=fig:etaDecay] for two different values of ε, and in Figure [\ref=fig:etaDecayB] for the case that αDε2 is normalized to its DAMA/LIBRA expected value. Heavier dark mesons may decay to two or more A''s, or to an A' and a lighter dark meson. Baryon number is an accidental low-energy symmetry of the dark sector, so we will assume that the ΔD is exactly stable, and all other dark baryons decay to it and one or more A''s.

Therefore, all dark-sector final states eventually decay to a collection of A''s and stable ΔD-baryons. The A' usually decays promptly through kinetic mixing (cf. equations ([\ref=eq:WDdecay]) and ([\ref=eq:WDdecaylength])):

[formula]

We expect to produce final states with at least one to two A' per dark hadron. These decays can easily generate high lepton multiplicities, even when relatively few dark hadrons are produced.

In one-flavor models at high multiplicities, production of dark baryons is unavoidable and leads to invisible products which escape the detector. For low-multiplicity final states, when [formula], the efficiency for producing individual exclusive final states, such as those that do not contain any baryons, are reasonably high.

Similar comments apply for multi-flavor models, in which the pions are significantly heavier than the A'. In this case, some pions may be stabilized by unbroken dark-sector flavor symmetries, or by an unbroken discrete subgroup of U(1)D if their charges are non-integer multiples of the dark Higgs charge. Kinetic mixing does not change the stability of these pions, and they will escape the detector. Pions that are not stabilized, however, can decay to 2A' through the chiral anomaly, and these A''s are observable through their prompt decays to Standard Model matter.

Dark Sectors with Towers of Metastable Mesons and Baryons

We now consider the one-flavor model with a heavy A'. If the A' is heavy, then the tower of mesons lighter than 2mη'D becomes metastable, i.e. they have no available decays within the dark sector. These decays are therefore suppressed by at least ε2, and can often be displaced or even invisible. Likewise, all baryons lighter than mΔD  +  mη'D are metastable for heavy A'.

The discussion of dark pion decays in Section [\ref=sec:twoFlavor] applies to the η'D as well. In particular, decays must proceed through two A' gauge bosons, and if both are off-shell they are suppressed by ε4. Therefore, they can easily be invisible. The decay of η'D through one or two off-shell A''s is included in Figures [\ref=fig:etaDecay] and [\ref=fig:etaDecayB].

The decays of the heavier mesons are generically much easier to see. The ωD vector meson generically mixes with the A', with a mixing angle that can be estimated from their masses,

[formula]

This leads to a decay width that is suppressed by ε2, and up to an unknown O(1) coefficient is given by

[formula]

The total ωD width depends only mildly on mωD. In Figure [\ref=fig:phiDecay], we show cτ for ωD for two different values of ε, while in Figure [\ref=fig:phiDecayDAMA], we normalize αDε2 to its DAMA/LIBRA expected value.

Exotic and excited mesons can have more spectacular decays. Spin-1 mesons are expected to decay into Standard Model pairs, just like the ωD, while spin-0 and spin-2 mesons can have 3-body decays into Standard Model states (through an off-shell A') and a lighter meson, as shown in Figure [\ref=fig:threebodyDecay]. These have a typical lifetime, estimated by dimensional analysis, given by

[formula]

which can easily be displaced. This is shown in Figure [\ref=fig:threebodyDecay] for two different values of ε, and in Figure [\ref=fig:threebodyDecayDAMA] for a case in which αDε2 has been normalized to its DAMA/LIBRA expected value.

Note that, unlike the decay of the η'D into Standard Model states, where the 3-body region of phase space required a tuning of independent masses mη'D and mA', the condition mη'D  /  ωD  <  mXD < 2mηD' is satisfied naturally for a tower of exotic mesons XD. Similar decays are expected for excited baryons.

To summarize: although significant missing energy from both baryons and η'D's is generically expected, typical events in such a sector also have a combination of prompt and displaced decays.

Dark Sectors with Uncolored Fermions

We have focused on Higgsed and confined sectors with no light fermions. However, the presence of a light fermion changes the phenomenology of either a Higgsed or a confined dark sector dramatically. Some or all of the bosons that are produced can decay to two dark-sector fermions, instead of decaying to Standard Model fermions through kinetic mixing. The dark-sector fermions are singlets under any confining gauge group (in the confined case, the dark-sector gauge group may have a subgroup which does not confine). The lightest dark-sector fermion does not have any decay modes induced by kinetic mixing, but can decay through new mixing operators of the form

[formula]

where hpD is a collection of dark-sector Higgses with the same quantum numbers as a dark-sector fermion LD, L is a Standard Model fermion, and hSM is a Standard Model Higgs. The decay lifetime of the dark fermions is quite model-dependent, but they will typically be long-lived. In this case, any dark-sector bosons that can decay to a pair of light dark-sector fermions may well be invisible. The only way to find such invisible sectors is by observing their recoil against other particles in the final state (in the context of B-factories, a photon).

In dark sectors with more than one light fermion, this situation is ameliorated. The second-lightest fermion f2 may have decays, through either Higgs quartic or gauge boson kinetic mixing,

[formula]

where the A' may be on- or off-shell. This decay is especially important when the decay f2  →  3f1 is kinematically not allowed. These fermions generically have longer decay lifetimes than their bosonic counterparts by the ratio of three-body to two-body phase space, ~  1 / 16π2. Such decays are much harder to find than the bosonic analogues because they contain missing energy, and the [formula] invariant mass need not reconstruct a resonance. Instead, the dilepton invariant mass distribution may have an endpoint. Moreover, if a sector contains both metastable fermions and metastable bosons, the bosonic decay products may reconstruct resonances.

Searches at low-energy e+e- colliders

Experiments at high-intensity e+e- colliders at low energies, such as the B-factories BaBar and BELLE, can open a direct window into the physics of a low-mass dark sector by observing production of dark-sector particles and their decays back into the Standard Model. Though striking, these final states are quite different from those of interest for precision measurements of the Standard Model, and could have gone unnoticed in existing B-factory datasets. A common feature of the dark-sector production processes is a high multiplicity of leptons, pairs of which reconstruct resonances. However, the precise multiplicity and energy of these leptons, and the presence of displaced vertices or missing energy, depend on the detailed structure of the dark sector.

This variety makes inclusive searches desirable, but the primary concern is maintaining acceptance for a large fraction of signal events while removing Standard Model backgrounds. To this end, we identify several search strategies, with exclusive search requirements for events with large physics backgrounds and inclusive treatments for more striking signal events. Our discussion is mostly qualitative; a quantitative study is beyond the scope of this paper. Our focus is on BaBar and BELLE, which represent the current high-intensity frontier, but similar analyses with data from KLOE, CLEO-c, the upcoming BES-III [\cite=Asner:2008nq], and elsewhere could be more sensitive, depending on the nature of the dark sector.

We identify six regions of interest, where different search strategies are required:

[formula] (exclusive), reconstructing Ecm (also [formula])

[formula] (exclusive), with displaced dilepton vertices (also [formula])

[formula] (inclusive), reconstructing Ecm (also + γ)

[formula] (inclusive), with displaced dilepton vertices (also + γ)

Very high track multiplicity, with many tracks consistent with leptons

γ + nothing

Before discussing each of these searches in turn, we list three prominent physics backgrounds that contribute to the channels with four or more leptons:

QED processes, [formula], which can reconstruct the full beam energy.

Two photons, emitted from the initial-state electron and positron, can combine to produce e+e-, μ+μ-, or π+π- pairs. The electron and positron are usually, but not always, lost along the beam pipe. A 4-lepton event is obtained if the initial state pair is observed, or if an additional γ* produces two more leptons. The latter kind of event can be rejected by requiring reconstruction of the full beam energy.

Sequential leptonic B decays produce events with up to four leptons, plus additional tracks; some energy is carried by neutrinos so these events do not reconstruct the full beam energy.

[formula] exclusive, reconstructing Ecm (with or without γ):

Four-lepton final states (μ+μ- μ+μ-, μ+μ-e+e-, and e+e-e+e-) that reconstruct the full beam energy can be produced by the simplest decay chains in Higgsed sectors (Figure [\ref=fig:feynHiggsed](a)), or by confined sectors with [formula]. These processes also produce τ and hadronic final states, but these are harder to search for, whereas muons have the lowest backgrounds. Requiring the reconstruction of the full beam energy Ecm removes the physics backgrounds 2) and 3) mentioned above, but also makes these searches insensitive to production modes that include stable or long-lived final states, such as baryons or metastable Higgs bosons. Pairs of leptons should reconstruct very narrow (resolution-limited) resonances, which can be used as a very useful discriminator between signal and background. The two lepton pairs need not reconstruct the same mass, but it is likely that they will reconstruct indistinguishable masses in an O(1) fraction of events. Similarly, [formula] final states can be produced by simple Higgsed-sector decays, or by confined sectors with [formula] and mA'  <  Ecm. In this case, in addition to pairwise mass reconstruction as in the pure [formula] case, the four leptons should now also reconstruct a (potentially broader) A' resonance.

[formula] exclusive with displaced vertices (with or without γ):

The requirement of displaced vertices allows significant reduction of Standard Model backgrounds 1) and 2), without demanding that the observed products reconstruct the full beam energy Ecm. In an exclusive four-lepton final state, background 3) is also negligible. Dropping the Ecm requirement is quite important -- in scenarios with displaced vertices, it is also generic to have missing energy coming from long-lived particles decaying outside the detector, or exactly stable baryons. For example, a confined sector with one light flavor can have displaced ωD decays, and long-lived invisible η'D decays. Similarly, the beam-energy requirement can be relaxed in a [formula] search and replaced by a displaced vertex cut. In this case, a four-lepton reconstructed mass peak is no longer expected as some of the A' mass can go into invisible decays. Pairs of same-flavor leptons should still reconstruct narrow resonances.

[formula] exclusive (with Ecm or displaced vertices, with or without γ):

More complex Higgsed-sector decay chains such as Figure [\ref=fig:feynHiggsed](a), where the Higgs decays within the detector, or confined-sector decays with larger ratio Ecm  /  ΛD can generate moderate track multiplicities. We stress that, though the leptonic final states are most distinctive, especially at higher masses the dark resonances will decay to τ and hadronic states as well. Therefore, it is essential not to veto on non-leptonic tracks, and to tag leptons as loosely as possible to suppress backgrounds. It may also be interesting to specifically search for events with τ+τ- or π+π- pairs. Therefore, a more inclusive approach is warranted, i.e. requiring 5 or 6 leptons to reduce background, plus additional tracks. As in the [formula] searches, two complementary cuts are useful for discriminating from background: either full reconstruction of Ecm or displaced vertices.

High Track Multiplicities

A confined dark sector with mη'D  ~  mη'QCD produces a high multiplicity ~  10 - 20 dark hadrons, of which a significant fraction decay visibly within the detector. The resulting dark-sector parton shower can lead to somewhat collimated jets of decay products. A large fraction (between  4/5 and 1/3 depending on meson mass) of dark mesons go into e or μ pairs, and this can be used to assist in distinguishing these final states from backgrounds. There is no source of analogous events from a Higgsed dark sector without a confined group.

γ + nothing:

A further interesting region of parameter space is when all the produced dark-sector states decay outside the detector, in which case all dark-sector products are invisible. This occurs, for example, if all states in the dark sector can decay to a long-lived pion or dark Higgs. In this case, the 'γ + nothing' mode is the only effective search at low-energy e+e- colliders (see also [\cite=Borodatchenkova:2005ct]). These events can be detected by observing a peak in the photon energy spectrum at [formula].

The searches mentioned above are complementary to the dilepton resonance searches ([formula]) that have recently been discussed in [\cite=Borodatchenkova:2005ct] [\cite=Pospelov:2008zw] [\cite=Aubert:2009cp]. However, the [formula] decay is significant only when the A' is the lightest state in the dark sector. Even if the A' is the lightest state of the dark sector, any other kinematically accessible states are pair-produced with a comparable rate through an off-shell A', which produces a signal in the multi-lepton channel, which has much lower QED backgrounds. The multi-lepton searches considered here overlap with the 4- and 6-lepton searches discussed in [\cite=Batell:2009yf] in the context of Abelian dark sectors, but we emphasize that much higher multiplicities are easily obtained in more general non-Abelian dark sectors.

Conclusions

Evidence for a low-mass dark sector may be hidden in unexamined e+e- collider data. If the new sector contains a U(1)D factor, then moderately large kinetic mixing ε  ~  10- 3 is not only generated by generic mechanisms, but suggested by a variety of experiments and observations that look for dark matter. States of a new sector with couplings in this range can be efficiently produced in e+e- colliders, and may decay spectacularly, so that potential discoveries are within the reach of searches in existing data from low-energy e+e- collider experiments such as BaBar, BELLE, CLEO-c, and KLOE.

The evidence for a "dark sector" from terrestrial and satellite searches for dark matter is indirect, but strikingly consistent. The large local electron/positron excesses reported by HEAT, PAMELA, PPB-BETS, and ATIC suggest interactions of O(TeV)-mass dark matter with a new boson with mass O(1 GeV). Simultaneously, two experiments suggest multiple dark matter states with small mass splittings: the INTEGRAL 511 keV-line and DAMA/LIBRA modulation signal are consistent with 1 - 10 MeV and ~  100 keV splittings among dark matter states, respectively. New forces, Higgsed or confined at O(GeV), can give rise to these splittings. Any subset of these results suggests a departure from the standard minimal WIMP paradigm, but dark matter data will provide at best an indirect probe of such structure.

If the DAMA/LIBRA modulation signal comes from inelastic scattering mediated by kinetic mixing, then it is the first quantitative probe of kinetic mixing between the Standard Model and the dark sector, and can be used to estimate the production rate of new dark-sector particles. If the mass of the new U(1)D gauge boson is mA'≃ 1 GeV, cross-sections ≃ 0.1 fb are expected in a Higgsed dark sector with αD≃α. This estimate leads to 50-100 events expected in the stored datasets from BaBar and BELLE. The e+e- production cross-section normalized to DAMA/LIBRA scales as m4A', so much larger cross-sections (O(pb)) are possible for a heavier A', while higher-luminosity experiments are required to observe dark sectors with lower mA'  ~  100's of MeV. Cross-sections up to 100 fb are possible even for a 1 GeV A', if the DAMA/LIBRA scattering is suppressed by a form factor, as expected in confined models.

Though spectacular, the signatures of dark-sector production at e+e- colliders would still have been missed by existing searches. The precise final states depend on the spectroscopy of the dark sector -- general regions of parameter space allow a combination of prompt and displaced decays, and states that escape the detector invisibly before decaying. All decay modes are expected to produce lepton-rich final states. Moderate multiplicities (4-10) of leptons and very high multiplicities are both possible, and require different search strategies. Some of these lepton pairs are expected to reconstruct very narrow resonances, which in principle can be combined to reconstruct the spectrum of the dark sector. Dark sectors with very long-lived final states may only be visible in a 'γ  +  ' search. Further work to optimize the strategies proposed here and study their efficiencies is an important task.

The small production cross-sections for [formula] MeV pose a particular challenge. Novel experiments are called for to explore this region. Two features of the low-mass region are noteworthy. Lower-energy O(100) colliders may reach higher luminosities than can be attained at GeV-energy colliders. Moreover, not far below the cross-section reach of B-factories, at ε  ~  10- 6, the expected decay lengths of spin-1 states in the dark sector become O(1 m), so that very different techniques, such as beam-dump experiments, may be the most fruitful way to isolate dark-sector production events.

Dark matter experiments suggest new low-energy gauge interactions beyond the Standard Model. If a dark sector exists, it dramatically reshapes our understanding of the structure of nature. Searches in existing collider data offer a simple but powerful probe of this new dynamics and should be pursued.

Constraints on Kinetic-mixing between hypercharge and a new U(1)D

In this appendix, we review the most important existing constraints on the kinetic mixing between Standard Model hypercharge and U(1)D.

For low-mass (MeV-GeV) dark photons A', there are a variety of constraints on the kinetic mixing that are summarized in [\cite=Pospelov:2008zw] (for a discussion of searches for even lower mass dark photons see [\cite=Ahlers:2007qf] [\cite=Ahlers:2008qc]). Constraints from Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis disfavor [formula](few MeV) [\cite=Serpico:2004nm]. For [formula] MeV, the strongest constraints come from the A' contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron, aA'e, while for mA' above 10 MeV, but less than a few GeV, the tightest constraints come from the A'-contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, aA'μ. For mA'  ~  O(100 MeV - 300 MeV), constraints from certain rare decays of mesons, such as K+  →  π+A', are in some cases competitive with the constraint on aA'μ, but depend sensitively on the decay modes of the A' -- see [\cite=Pospelov:2008zw] for a more detailed discussion. Above a few GeV, kinetic mixing is only very weakly constrained. However, since kinetic mixing also induces a coupling between the Z and dark-sector matter, a potential probe could come from searches for rare Z-decays.

Since we are interested in the mass range mA'  ~   10 MeV - 20 GeV, we focus on the constraint on aA'μ and the potential probe coming from rare Z-decays.

Anomalous Lepton Magnetic Moments:

Let us first discuss the contribution from the A' to the anomalous magnetic moment of a lepton, [formula]. This was calculated in [\cite=Pospelov:2008zw], and is given by

[formula]

For aA'e, this can be converted to a constraint of [formula] [\cite=Pospelov:2008zw], which is important for [formula] MeV. A constraint on aA'μ is more ambiguous, since the theoretical prediction for the muon anomalous magnetic moment within the Standard Model, aμ, involves a hadronic contribution which must be estimated from experiments, which do not all agree. Using data from e+e- annihilation to hadrons, the theoretical value of aμ is smaller than the measured value by (302  ±  88)  ×  10- 11, a 3.4σ deficit [\cite=Passera:2008hj] [\cite=Bennett:2006fi]. However, estimates involving data from τ's [\cite=Davier:2002dy] or from preliminary BaBar results on the precision measurement of the e+e-  →  π+π-(γ) cross-section with the ISR method [\cite=Davier08] do not point to a significant discrepancy. Since the A' contribution to aμ is positive, a conservative constraints on the ε - mA' parameter space is obtained by taking the estimate from e+e- annihilation to hadrons. In particular, for the constraints shown in Section [\ref=sec:production], we follow [\cite=Pospelov:2008zw] and require aA'μ  <  (302 + 5σ)  ×  10- 11  =  7.4  ×  10- 9. For mA'  ≫  mμ, equation ([\ref=eq:muon]) reduces to [formula], and the constraint on aA'μ thus becomes very weak for mA' larger than a few GeV.

Exotic Z-Decays:

For mA' larger than mμ, searches for exotic Z-decays among the 2  ×  107 Z-bosons recorded by the experiments at LEPI could potentially probe kinetic mixings more sensitively than aμ. Let us discuss this in more detail. The coupling induced between the Z and dark-sector fermions is given by

[formula]

where Nf is the number of dark-sector particles coupling to A' with gauge coupling gD, and sin θW is the Standard Model weak-mixing angle. In this expression, the A' coupling to the electromagnetic current has been normalized as L  ⊃  εgDA'μJμEM, see equation ([\ref=eq:mixing]). The Z-decay width to dark-sector fermions is thus

[formula]

where Nc is the number of colors of the dark-sector gauge group.

Since the total width of the Z has been measured to be 2.4952  ±  0.0023 GeV [\cite=Amsler:2008zzb], the branching ratio of Z  →  X̄X is given by

[formula]

where we assumed mX  ≪  mZ. Depending on the decay modes of X, which we discussed in detail in Section [\ref=sec:generalSector], a variety of signatures are possible. For example, if the X's decay invisibly or outside the detector, the constraint is not better than the uncertainty on the width of the Z, which is about 0.1%. More exotic Z decays into multi-leptons are possible, but require dedicated searches. The best constraints on rare Z decay branching ratios are no better than the 10- 6 - 10- 5 level [\cite=Amsler:2008zzb], and even dedicated searches may not reach this level for complicated final states. Equation ([\ref=eq:Zdecay]) shows that for typical parameters that give O(fb) cross-sections at B-factories, the branching ratio Z  →  X̄X is about three orders of magnitude smaller than what could be probed at LEPI even with a dedicated search. For the multi-lepton final states we consider in this paper, the B-factories will thus be a far more sensitive probe of the ε - mA' parameter space than LEPI, at least for mA' less than a few 10's of GeV.

DAMA/LIBRA Normalization of Couplings

Inelastic dark matter offers a simple explanation that reconciles the annual modulation signal reported by DAMA/LIBRA with the null results of other experiments, and is reviewed in [\cite=TuckerSmith:2001hy] [\cite=Chang:2008gd]. Below, we summarize our procedure for normalizing αDε2 assuming that DAMA/LIBRA is explained by an iDM mechanism. We will normalize αDε2 for two iDM scenarios: one in which the inelastic channel proceeds through charged-current scattering as in [\cite=TuckerSmith:2001hy], and one where the inelastic channel is through a hyperfine transition as in [\cite=Schuster:2009].

For charged-current scenarios, the inelastic cross-section to scatter off of a nucleus of mass mN and charge Z recoiling with energy ER is

[formula]

where α is the fine structure constant, v is the dark matter nucleus relative velocity, and mA' is the A' mass. F(ER) is the Helm nuclear form factor [\cite=Helm:1956zz], and it accounts for the loss of coherence scattering off of the entire nucleus at large recoil. We use,

[formula]

where s = 1 fm, [formula], r = 1.2A1 / 3 fm, and [formula].

For hyperfine transition scattering [\cite=Schuster:2009], the inelastic cross-section is

[formula]

where [formula] is the A' electric dipole of the dark matter. To fix the relation between ΛD and the hyperfine splitting δ in this case, we introduce a scale Λ̃D such that

[formula]

As discussed in Section [\ref=sec:DAMANormalization], Λ̃D  /  ΛD is naturally a small number. We will therefore normalize αDε2 as a function of mA' for different choices of the small dimensionless coefficient,

[formula]

Following [\cite=Lewin:1995rx], the differential scattering rate per unit detector mass is,

[formula]

where ρ = 0.3 GeV/cm3 is the local density of dark matter, and f(v) is the dark matter velocity and velocity distribution function in the lab frame. Introducing a [formula] to naively cut off the velocity profile above the galactic escape velocity [formula] km/s, we use a simple velocity distribution function,

[formula]

where v0  ≈  220 km/s, and ve is the earth's speed in the galactic frame. We use the numerical values reported in [\cite=Lewin:1995rx] for [formula]. For the annual modulation rate, we use

[formula]

To normalize the combination αDε2, we fit to the reported DAMA/LIBRA signal, using the combined 0.82 ton-yr exposure[\cite=Bernabei:2005hj]. We do this by minimizing a χ2 function using the 12 half-keVee bins and reported error bars between 2 - 8 keVee with 10 = 12 - 2 independent degrees of freedom. The lower and upper ranges of αDε2 are taken by scanning over the region with χ2  ≤  16, and typically differ by a factor of ~  10. Our estimate is obtained by taking the geometric mean of the lower and upper values of αDε2.
