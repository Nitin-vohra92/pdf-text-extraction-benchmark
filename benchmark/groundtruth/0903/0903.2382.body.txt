Infinite words without palindrome

Notations

For a finite word [formula], the reversal of w is the word [formula]. This notation is extended to sets by setting F~  =  {w̃|w∈F} for any set F of finite words. A word w is a palindrome if w̃  =  w. A set F of finite words is closed under reversal if F~  =  F.

For an infinite word x, we denote respectively by [formula] and [formula], the set of factors of x and the set of factors of x which are palindrome.

An infinite word is uniformly recurrent if each of its factors occurs infinitely many times with bounded gap. Equivalently, x is uniformly recurrent if for any integer m, there is an integer n such that any factor of x of length n contains all factors of x of length m.

If x uniformly recurrent and if [formula] is infinite, the set of factors of x is closed under reversal, that is [formula]. In the following examples, we show that the converse does not hold.

Over a 4-letter alphabet

Let A be the alphabet A  =  {0,1,2,3}. Define by induction the sequence [formula] of words over A by x0  =  01 and xn + 1  =  xn23n. The first values are x1  =  012310, x2  =  01231023013210 and x3  =  012310230132102301231032013210. We denote by x the limit of the sequence [formula].

We claim that the word x has the following properties

x is uniformly recurrent,

[formula] is closed under reversal : [formula],

[formula] is finite : [formula].

It can be easily shown by induction on n that there is a sequence [formula] of words from {23,32} such that Since each factor of x is factor of xn for n large enough, the word x is uniformly recurrent. If w is a factor of xn, then w̃ is a factor of xn + 1. This shows that [formula]. The word x belongs to ((01 + 10)(23 + 32))ω. Therefore, it has no factor of the form aa of aba for a,b∈A. This shows that [formula].

Over a 2-letter alphabet

Define the morphism h from A* to {0,1}* as follows Note the image of each letter is a palindrome and h(w̃)  =  h(w)~. Let y be the infinite word h(x). The beginning of y is the following. We claim that y has the following properties

y is uniformly recurrent,

[formula] is closed under reversal : [formula],

[formula] is finite.

Since y is the image by a morphism of uniformly recurrent word, it is also uniformly recurrent. Since h(w̃) is the mirror image of h(w) for each word w, equality [formula] holds. Each word w from [formula] is a factor of a word of the form h(aub) where u belongs to [formula] and a,b∈A. Since [formula] is finite, [formula] is also finite.

Define by induction the sequence [formula] of words over {0,1} by z0  =  01 and zn + 1  =  zn01n. The first values are z1  =  010110, z2  =  01011001011010 and z3  =  010110010110100101011010011010. We denote by z the limit of the sequence [formula]. Note that z is also equal to g(x) where the morphism g is given by g(0)  =  g(2)  =  0 and g(1)  =  g(3)  =  1. We claim that the word z has the following properties

z is uniformly recurrent,

[formula] is closed under reversal : [formula],

[formula] is finite.

The first two properties are proved as for x. We claim that each word w in [formula] satisfies |w|  ≤  12. Note that it suffices to prove that [formula] contains no word of length 13 or 14. We prove by induction on n that no palindrome of length 13 or 14 occurs in zn. An inspection proves that no palindrome of length 13 or 14 occurs in either z3  =  z2012 or in 201z2. For n  ≥  3, the word zn can be factorized zn  =  z2tn2 and the word zn + 1 is equal to z2tn201z2t̃n2. Since z2 is of length 14 a palindrome of length 13 or 14 which occurs in zn + 1 occurs either in zn or in 201z2. The result follows from the induction hypothesis.

Links with paperfolding

We point out a few links between the words we have introduced and the so-called folding word. For a finite word [formula] over {0,1}, denote by ŵ the word [formula] where   =  1 and   =  0.

Define by induction the sequence [formula] of words over {0,1} by t0  =  0 and tn + 1  =  tn0n. We denote by t the limit of the sequence [formula]. The set of factors of t is not closed under reversal. Indeed, the word 01000 is a factor of t whereas 00010 is not. The word y is equal to f(t) where the morphism f is given by f(0)  =  01 and f(1)  =  10.
