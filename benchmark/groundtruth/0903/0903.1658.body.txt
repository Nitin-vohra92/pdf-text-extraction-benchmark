Interstellar Dust Models and Evolutionary Implications

Introduction

[\citet=Trumpler_1930] and [\citet=Lindblad_1935] recognized that reddening of distant stars was produced by submicron particles present in interstellar space, but over 70 years later we continue to work to determine the composition, shape, and size distribution of interstellar dust. Despite substantial advances in our understanding of interstellar physics, the problem is far too difficult for an ab initio approach. We do not know enough about physical conditions in stellar outflows (where some grains are formed) and the interstellar medium (where grains undergo modification), and our understanding of the physical and chemical processes occuring on grain surfaces and within grains is very limited. We cannot predict with any confidence how grain materials will evolve over hundreds of Myr in the interstellar medium (ISM). We need to use what physics we know, but observations must guide us.

Almost all of the observational information concerning interstellar dust arises from interaction of electromagnetic radiation with dust: scattering, absorption, and emission. The first "detection" of interstellar dust was through extinction of starlight: [\citet=Herschel_1785] remarked on the absence of stars in certain portions of the Milky Way ("An Opening in the Heavens"), although he did not understand its cause. Over a century later, [\citet=Barnard_1907] noted that the neighborhood of ρ Oph was an example of "an apparently absorbing medium". We now study scattering, absorption, and emission of radiation by interstellar dust at wavelengths ranging from Å (X-rays) to cm (microwaves).

Observational Constraints

Extinction

The wavelength-dependent extinction of starlight - the so-called "extinction curve" - remains the principal source of information about interstellar dust. Interstellar extinction has been studied on many sightlines at wavelengths between about 2μm and 0.1μm. On sightlines with sufficient column density, it is possible to study the extinction at wavelengths as long as [formula]m. An average extinction curve is shown in Figure [\ref=fig:extcurv].

The extinction curve contains spectral features that constrain the composition of the dust. The strongest feature by far is a broad "bump" peaking near 2175Å. The strength of this feature requires that it be produced by a substance composed of high-abundance elements, such as C, Mg, Si, or Fe [\citep=Draine_1989a]. The position of the feature, and its width, are strongly suggestive of π  →  π* excitations in aromatic carbon, such as graphite or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Some authors [\citep=Draine+Li_2007] think that the feature is produced by the large population of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that is required to explain a number of infrared emission features.

The extinction curve in Fig. [\ref=fig:extcurv] shows a conspicuous feature near 10μm that can be confidently attributed to Si-O stretching modes in amorphous silicates; a companion feature at 18μm is attributed to O-Si-O bending modes. The absence of fine structure in the profile indicates that the silicate material is amorphous - [\citet=Kemper+Vriend+Tielens_2005] place an upper limit of 2% on the crystalline fraction.

There is a weak absorption feature at 3.4μm that is attributed to the C-H stretch in hydrocarbon material. The nature of the hydrocarbon material is controversial: from the profile shape and strength, [\citet=Pendleton+Allamandola_2002] estimate that the carbonaceous material is ~  85% aromatic and ~  15% aliphatic, whereas [\citet=Dartois+MunozCaro+Deboffle+dHendecourt_2004] conclude that at most 15% of the carbon is aromatic.

Finally, we note that the extinction curve in Fig. [\ref=fig:extcurv] actually contains ~  200 weak but detected spectral features - the "diffuse interstellar bands", or DIBs. 86 years after the first DIBs were reported by [\citet=Heger_1922], it is embarassing to have to admit that not a single one has yet been identified.

The extinction curve shows a smooth rise from the near IR to the vacuum UV. A broad range of grain sizes is required to reproduce this: the rapid rise in extinction shortward of 1500Å requires very large numbers of grains with radii a  <  0.02  μm, but the extinction in the visible requires that most of the grain mass be in grains with sizes 0.05μm  <  a  <  0.3μm. The overall strength of the extinction per H nucleon requires that the grains providing the bulk of the extinction be based on high-abundance elements such as C, O, Mg, Si, and Fe.

Extinction curves vary from one sightline to another. Figure [\ref=fig:extcurv] shows an average extinction curve, but grain models must be able to account for the observed sightline-to-sightline variations in the wavelength-dependence of extinction.

Other Evidence

In addition to the wavelength-dependent extinction, a modern dust model must also be consistent with a wide range of other observations of electromagnetic radiation absorbed, scattered, or radiated by dust: [formula] Polarization of starlight by interstellar grains. [formula] Scattering of starlight by grains (reflection nebulae, diffuse galactic light). [formula] Small-angle scattering of X-rays by interstellar grains. [formula] Infrared and submm emission from interstellar grains heated by starlight. [formula] Polarization of the infrared and submm emission from dust. [formula] Microwave emission from dust. In addition to the above, we can study the interstellar grains that are entering the heliosphere today [\citep=Landgraf+Baggaley+Grun+etal_2000] [\citep=Kruger+Landgraf+Altobelli+Grun_2007], and we can analyze presolar grains trapped 4.5 Gyr ago in primitive meteorites and comets.

Our estimates of the total interstellar abundances of elements such as C, Mg, Si, and Fe, plus direct measurement of gas-phase abundances using absorption lines, tell us how much of each element appears to be locked up in solid grains. Gas-phase abundances of species such as Si, Ca, and Ti are observed to vary from one sightline to another, which implies that depletion from the gas must be able to occur relatively rapidly; a successful grain model must provide enough surface area for depletion of Si+, Ca+, and Ti+ to take place rapidly.

The observed sightline-to-sightline variations of gas-phase D/H is best understood if D is actually depleting onto dust grains [\citep=Draine_2004a] [\citep=Draine_2006b] and evidence for this is now strong [\citep=Prochaska+Tripp+Howk_2005] [\citep=Linsky+Draine+Moos+etal_2006] [\citep=Lallement+Hebrard+Welsh_2008]. A dust model must contain a component capable of trapping a substantial fraction of the D present in the ISM. The PAHs may be able to accomplish this [\citep=Draine_2006b].

In general, dust grains play a crucial role in interstellar chemistry, and a successful dust model should eventually be able to "predict" the rate for formation of interstellar H2 via reactions on grain surfaces. Photoelectrons emitted by interstellar grains make a major contribution to heating of interstellar gas, and a successful grain model must be in quantitative agreement with heating rates inferred from observations of interstellar gas.

A Model Using Amorphous Silicate and Carbonaceous Grains

Current modeling techniques do not allow us to "invert" the observational constraints to arrive at a grain model. Constrained by elemental abundances, all sensible grain models consist predominantly of carbonaceous and amorphous silicate material, but there are various candidates for the carbonaceous material. For example, [\citet=Zubko+Dwek+Arendt_2004] consider models involving varying amounts of PAHs, graphite, 3 different types (AC, BE, ACH2) of amorphous carbon, and an organic refractory material with composition C25H25O5N.

Here we will focus on one particular model, in which the carbonaceous material in ultrasmall particles is assumed to have the optical and thermal properties of PAHs, while the larger carbonaceous grains are assigned the optical properties of graphite. If polarization is not of interest, the particles may be approximated as spheres. For these materials, [\citet=Weingartner+Draine_2001a] found size distributions that reproduce the extinction in various regions of the Milky Way, and in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. For current estimates of solar and interstellar abundances, the WD01 size distributions use somewhat more C, Mg, and Si than is nominally available, but one should keep in mind that (a) there are modeling uncertainties (e.g., the grains are certainly not solid spheres), (b) the actual interstellar abundances of C, Mg, Si, and Fe are uncertain, (c) gas-phase abundances of C have recently been revised downward [\citep=Sofia+Parvathi_2009], increasing the amount of carbon inferred to be in dust: it now appears that only [formula] of the C is in the gas, and 2/3 is in the dust.

The PAH-graphite-amorphous silicate model satisfactorily reproduces interstellar extinction (see WD01), but it can also be tested in other ways. A dust grain illuminated by starlight will absorb energy, which will be reradiated in the infrared. The infrared emission spectrum will depend upon both the temperature of the grain and its infrared opacity.

Large [formula] grains in the local starlight background will be heated to a more-or-less steady temperature of 15-20K. However, very small grains (1) absorb photons much less frequently, and (2) have very small heat capacities, so that one absorbed photon can raise the grain to a high temperature, followed by very rapid cooling. Because of this, one cannot speak of an average temperature for very small grains - instead, one must determine the temperature distribution function (dP / dT), where dP is the probability of finding the grain in the temperature interval

[formula]

Polarization of Starlight and Polarized IR-Submm Emission

WD01 showed that a model based on amorphous silicate and carbonaceous grains, including PAHs, could reproduce observations of extinction in the Milky Way, LMC, and SMC, and DL07 showed that these same dust models could reproduce observations of infrared emission.

In addition to interstellar extinction, a dust model should be able to reproduce observations of polarization of starlight by aligned dust grains. The infrared emission from aligned dust grains will be polarized, and microwave and submillimeter polarimetry has advanced to the point where it is beginning to be possible to measure the polarized emission from the diffuse ISM. For computational convenience, the WD01 and DL07 models assumed spherical grains, and therefore couldn't say anything about polarization.

Early modeling of starlight polarization at optical wavelengths approximated the grains by infinite cylinders [\citep=Greenberg+Hong_1974], but improved numerical methods and faster computers allowed [\citet=Kim+Martin_1995] to model the grains as spheroids. Advances in polarimetric techniques at submm to cm wavelengths now allow detection of polarized emission from the diffuse ISM [\citep=Page+Hinshaw+Komatsu+etal_2007] and theorists should now make predictions for the degree of polarization that is expected for different dust models.

In addition to reproducing the wavelength-dependent extinction, a dust model must first reproduce the polarization of starlight as a function of wavelength. All dust models must have aligned, nonspherical grains containing amorphous silicates, because the interstellar silicate feature is known to produce polarization in extinction [\citep=Smith+Wright+Aitken+etal_2000]. If carbonaceous material is present in a separate grain population, at this time there is no evidence that such grains are aligned. Absence of polarization in the 3.4μm C-H stretch feature suggests that the carbonaceous particles (at least those responsible for the 3.4[formula] feature) may not be aligned [\citep=Chiar+Adamson+Kerr+etal_2005].

Using models based on carbonaceous grains (including PAHs) and amorphous silicate grains with various assumptions about (1) the shapes of the grains and (2) whether or not the carbonaceous grains are aligned, [\citet=Draine+Fraisse_2009] are able to find size distributions and alignment functions (degree of alignment as a function of grain size) that are consistent with observations of interstellar extinction and starlight polarization. Figure [\ref=fig:FIRpol](left) shows the infrared emission from their models when the dust is heated by the local interstellar radiation field. The models are all in good agreement with the far-infrared emission per H observed by DIRBE [\citep=Dwek+Arendt+Fixsen+etal_1997] [\citep=Arendt+Odegard+Weiland+etal_1998].

Fig. [\ref=fig:FIRpol](right) shows that the different models predict quite different degrees of polarization, and with different dependences on wavelength. This is good news - it means that upcoming multiwavelength measurements of linear polarization by Planck should be able to reject some (or perhaps all!) of these models.

Where Do Interstellar Grains Come From?

The evolution of interstellar dust involves a complex interplay of many poorly-understood processes, in an arena - the ISM - that we also have a very incomplete picture of. Ab initio approaches to the evolution of interstellar dust are therefore premature.

Under these circumstances, the best approach to understanding the evolution of interstellar dust is to first determine what kind of dust is present in the ISM today. We can then try to construct an evolutionary scenario that is consistent with the grains that are observed to be present today.

To summarize: Observations of interstellar gas-phase abundances ("depletions"), extinction, polarization, and emission by interstellar dust, and models that are able to reproduce those observations, tell us that:

The abundant elements Mg, Si, Fe reside primarily in dust.

Perhaps 2/3 of C is in dust.

The Si is predominantly in amorphous silicate material. Based on available abundances, the composition is likely to be (approximately) Mg1.1Fe0.9SiO4.

There is a substantial population of PAHs that contains ~  10-20% of the interstellar C in the Milky Way; ~  4-5% of the total grain mass is contributed by PAHs in the Milky Way and other star-forming galaxies with ~  solar metallicity [\citep=Draine+Dale+Bendo+etal_2007].

Whatever the processes of interstellar grain evolution, they must be able to account for the above facts.

Mass Budget for the Milky Way ISM

Figure [\ref=fig:massflow] illustrates the overall flow of mass into and out of the ISM. The mass of interstellar gas in the Milky Way is [formula], divided approximately equally between atomic and molecular gas. Gas is being converted into stars at a rate of [formula]. If there were no source of gas, the ISM would be consumed on a relatively short timescale [formula] yr. However, there is return of material to the ISM from stars via various kinds of stellar outflows (stellar winds, planetary nebulae, novae, supernovae) and, in addition, there is evidence for infall of low metallicity gas. The rates are uncertain, particularly for infall, but it appears (see Figure [\ref=fig:massflow]) that the net rate at which the ISM is losing mass is [formula]/yr, so that the characteristic decay time is of order [formula] yr, which seems a plausible number for a galaxy that has been making stars in the disk at a more-or-less steady rate over the last ~  9 Gyr [\citep=Rocha-Pinto+Scalo+Maciel+Flynn_2000].

Production of Stardust

Some of the stellar outflows returning matter to the ISM are dusty. Outflows from cool oxygen-rich red giants contain silicate grains, and the outflows from cool carbon stars contain solid carbonaceous grains, in some cases with SiC as one of the carbon-bearing materials. The ejecta that form planetary nebulae are generally dusty. Some novae produce dust, but the net contribution from novae appears to be small.

At least some stardust comes from supernovae: supernova-produced dust grains have been identified in meteorites, and the internal extinction and IR emission from some young supernova remnants is evidence for dust formation. Supernovae have even been described as "dust factories" [\citep=Sugerman+Ercolano+Barlow+etal_2006]. However, the average mass of dust per SN does not appear to be large: the Type II SN 1987a produced [formula] of dust [\citep=Ercolano+Barlow+Sugerman_2007]. The current record-holder for dust production is the Type II SN 2003gd, which produced [formula] of dust [\citep=Sugerman+Ercolano+Barlow+etal_2006]. There is as yet no evidence of dust formation in Type Ia SNe. While only a very small number of SNe have as yet been studied, it appears that SNe produce, on average, [formula] of dust, containing [formula] of the condensible elements. It should also be kept in mind that the dust that has been detected in these supernovae is moving at high speeds (~  103  km  ~  s- 1), and is expected to undergo erosion by sputtering and possible destruction in grain-grain collisions when it is eventually decelerated to the low velocities of the quiescent ISM. While dust production unquestionably occurs, "dust factory" may be a misnomer.

An accurate inventory of the different sources of stardust is not available, but provisional estimates are offered in Table 1. The overall gas return rates from the different stellar sources in Table 1 can be estimated reasonably reliably, given our knowledge of the IMF [\citep=Kroupa_2001]: (1) stars with initial masses above [formula] become supernovae, leaving behind either neutron stars or black holes. (2) Initial masses between [formula] and [formula] leave behind white dwarfs of varying masses. (3) Stars with initial masses below [formula] do not evolve on the timescales of interest.

We do not have a good understanding of either the stellar wind phenomenon itself, or the formation of dust in some stellar winds, so the estimates of dust injection are less reliable. The estimates for planetary nebulae and winds from cool stars assume that the dust mass is 0.5% of the gas mass, which corresponds to efficient condensation of the condensible elements. According to the estimates in Table 1, stardust is entering the ISM at a rate [formula]/yr.

Stardust Lifetimes

Newly-made stardust moves away from its stellar source and begins a journey through the ISM. If nothing else happens, the grain will eventually find itself in a parcel of gas collapsing to form a new star. If this were the only process that removed grains from the ISM, the grain lifetime τd would be the lifetime of material against star formation: [formula] yr.

The ISM is a violent neighborhood, agitated by fast stellar winds and supernova explosions. A grain that is overrun by a fast shock is subject to sputtering by the shocked gas. Sputtering in shock waves has been studied by a number of authors. [\citet=Draine+Salpeter_1979b] found that [formula] silicate grains had > 50% of the grain material returned to the gas in radiative shocks with shock speeds vs  >  200  km  s- 1.

We can estimate the global effects of SNe by a very simple argument. A supernova blastwave with initial energy E0 = 1051erg in gas with density nH  ≈  1  cm- 3 is Sedov-like until the shock speed drops to ~  200  km  s- 1. During the Sedov phase,

[formula]

and therefore the mass of gas shocked at shock speeds >  200  kms- 1 is

[formula]

Thus one supernova can "clean" [formula] of ISM of dust. If E0 = 1051erg is a representative value for the kinetic energy of a SN, and the SN rate in the Milky Way disk is [formula], then the probability per unit time of an interstellar grain being overtaken by a vs  >  200  km  s- 1 shock is

[formula]

There are other destructive processes as well, particularly grain-grain collisions in slower shock waves. Detailed studies [\citep=Barlow+Silk_1977] [\citep=Draine+Salpeter_1979b] [\citep=Dwek+Scalo_1980] [\citep=Jones+Tielens+Hollenbach+McKee_1994] that try to take into account the complications of a multiphase ISM find solid matter lifetimes [formula]yr, consistent with the simple estimate above.

To restate this: for a randomly-selected Si atom in a grain, the probability per unit time that it will be returned to the gas is [formula]. In steady state, stardust injection = stardust removal, and we can estimate the mass of stardust that should be present in the ISM.

[formula]

from which we estimate [formula]. However, the total mass of refractory interstellar dust is [formula]. Thus we conclude that

[formula]

Stardust accounts for only [formula] of the total mass of interstellar dust.

Another way to approach the problem is to estimate the gas-phase abundance of Si. Let [formula] be the fraction of Si entering the ISM from stellar sources (stellar winds, planetary nebulae, supernovae...) that is in solid form. Because supernovae appear to condense [formula] of their condensibles into grains [\citep=Ercolano+Barlow+Sugerman_2007] and the winds from many stars (e.g., O stars) appear to be dustless, we may estimate [formula]. The fraction of interstellar Si that is in stardust will be

[formula]

But in fact interstellar Si is almost always found to be strongly depleted, with f(Si)  ≈  0.9 in dust. Therefore, we reach the same conclusion as before: most of the Si in interstellar grains is not in stardust - it must have been added to the grains in the ISM.

This is not a new result - [\citet=Draine+Salpeter_1979b] reached the conclusion that grain destruction was rapid and that regrowth of dust in the ISM was required to explain the observed depletions. The numbers basically haven't changed appreciably since then; the argument has been reiterated a number of times [\citep=Dwek+Scalo_1980] [\citep=Draine_1990] [\citep=Weingartner+Draine_1999] [\citep=Draine_2006c]. Nevertheless, some authors continued to hold the view that the solids in the ISM were primarily formed in stars.

For example, a number of papers have argued that the low abundance of crystalline silicate material in the ISM requires that crystalline stardust material must be amorphized by cosmic ray damage in the ISM [\citep=Bringa+Kucheyev+Loeffler+etal_2007]. However, the low abundance of crystalline silicates in the ISM can be easily understood: (1) grain destruction reduces the abundance of stardust in the ISM, and (2) the silicate material grown in the ISM is amorphous.

Isotopically anomalous silicates found in interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) are presumably stardust. Techniques have recently been developed for study of stardust silicates in meteorites [\citep=Nguyen+Zinner_2004b] [\citep=Keller+Messenger_2008]. Recent studies of stardust silicates identified in this way find that it is ~  80% amorphous, and ~  20% crystalline material (L. P. Keller 2008, talk given at this conference). If this 4:1 amorphous:crystalline ratio applies to the overall production of silicate stardust, then the observed upper limit of ~  2% on the crystalline fraction in the ISM [\citep=Kemper+Vriend+Tielens_2005] implies an upper limit of 2%  ×  (4 + 1) = 10% on the fraction of interstellar silicate material contributed by silicate stardust. This is in agreement with our estimate in eq. ([\ref=eq:f(Si)]). The low crystalline fraction in interstellar silicates does not require that some of the crystalline material be amorphized - the expected destruction processes in the ISM suffice to keep the crystalline fraction below the current upper limit.

Growth of Solid Material in the ISM

If most interstellar solid matter is not stardust, it follows that

The growth of grain material takes place on the surfaces of already-present grains - a process also referred to as "depletion" of condensible elements from the gas. We know that this process takes place, because we observe sightline-to-sightline variations in the gas phase abundances of the "depletable" species.

The depletion process has three stages:

An atom or ion of the element must collide with a preexisting grain surface.

The atom must become bound to the grain material in a way that allows it to be retained in the presence of fluxes of ultraviolet radiation and reactive species such as atomic H and O.

The resulting grain material(s) will undergo heavy UV irradiation - whatever survives (or is produced by) UV photolysis will be what is present in the ISM today. Cosmic ray irradiation also occurs, but is of secondary importance.

Step 1 is just a matter of kinetics: The rate for a given ion to hit a grain will be determined by the total geometric area provided by the grains - the surface area will be dominated by the smallest grains - and by the random velocities of atoms and ions and the (possibly large) velocities of grains relative to the gas. In diffuse regions (where UV radiation is present) the ion-grain collision rate will be affected strongly by the charge state of the grains. Collisions between positively charged grains and ions such as Si+ will be suppressed, but part of the grain population will be neutral, and the smaller PAHs are expected to have an appreciable fraction that are negative, with which ions will have enhanced collision rates.

Let Σd,21  ·  10- 21cm2  /  H  =   dust geometric cross section per H nucleon. From modeling the UV extinction, we know that [formula]. Let va be the velocity of an atom relative to the grains. The timescale τacc for this atom to collide with a grain surface is

[formula]

This time is relatively short. In the case of ions, the accretion rate will be modified by Coulomb repulsion (by positive grains) or attraction (by negative grains). [\citet=Weingartner+Draine_1999] discussed the kinetics of accretion of ions (Ti+ was used as an example) onto grains in diffuse interstellar clouds, with attention to the charge distribution of the PAHs. They found that the very large surface area of PAHs resulted in a depletion rate

[formula]

The fact that this is a factor 50 smaller than eq. (8) can be attributed to two factors. First, the total surface area in small particles is considerably larger than 10- 21cm2  /  H. Second, carbonaceous grains smaller than 10- 6  cm and silicate grains smaller than [formula]cm were negatively charged, with Coulomb focussing increasing the collision rates by large factors. Evidently depletion and grain growth can take place on time scales ~  2  ×  105yr in ordinary HI clouds, with [formula].

We conclude that the low gas-phase abundances of elements such as Si and Ti can be understood based on rapid rates of depletion from the gas phase for the conditions found in ordinary HI clouds - the "cold neutral medium". The bulk of interstellar grain material is the result of accretion from the gas in the cold ISM.

What Materials Form? Why Do Some Elements Not Deplete?

Thermal Desorption

In typical diffuse clouds, some elements (e.g., Ca, Al, Si, Fe) are heavily "depleted" from the gas, while others (e.g., S, Cu, Zn) show much less of a tendency to deplete [\citep=Jenkins_2004]. To try to understand how this selectivity can occur, let's examine the steps in the depletion process.

Grains with radii [formula]m remain very cold in the diffuse ISM, with temperatures [formula]K. At these temperatures, almost any atom or ion impinging with a kinetic energy [formula]eV is expected to have a high probability for "sticking" to the surface at least temporarily (where "temporarily" means long compared to the characteristic vibrational period ~  10- 12s), with the exception of the inert gases such as He and Ne. Normal physisorption via van der Waals forces will bind species such as S, Cu, and Zn to grain surfaces with binding energies [formula] - 0.2eV. Thermal desorption will take place with a probability per unit time ~  ν0 exp ( - B / kT), with ν0  ≈  1012s- 1. For B = 0.05  eV and a grain temperature T = 20K, the lifetime against thermal desorption would be [formula]s, whereas if B = 0.10  eV, the lifetime becomes [formula]yr. Therefore if an atom is to remain on the grain surface long enough to matter, it must have a binding energy B > 0.1  eV. Unfortunately, the binding energies of the atoms of interest (C, Mg, Si, Fe) to surfaces of interest (amorphous silicate or carbonaceous materials) are not known, but it is plausible to imagine that those elements that do deplete are held to the grains surface by binding energies B  >  0.1  eV.

Hydrogenation

We must now estimate some other rates. Consider one "surface site" on a grain, where some species X is adsorbed. The area of this surface site will be A  ≈  10- 15cm2. This surface site is being bombarded by H atoms at a rate

[formula]

The impinging H atoms might form chemical bonds with the adsorbate X; whether they will do so is not known (for some X there may be an energy barrier in the "reaction coordinate" necessary to produce XH, preventing reaction at low energies) but it does seem possible that incident H might result in hydrogenation of some physisorbed atoms, such as S. The resulting molecule might be ejected from the grain surface, or might remain there.

In H I clouds, O atoms are the third most abundant species in the gas (after H and He), and will collide with a surface site at a rate

[formula]

Photodesorption or Photolysis by UV Radiation

Dust grains in diffuse clouds are exposed to diffuse starlight, including ultraviolet radiation from hot stars. The starlight intensity is such that, for example, a C atom in the gas (with ionization energy 11.26 eV) will be photoionized at a rate [formula]. Species on grain surfaces will in general have allowed transitions to excited states with E  <  13.6 ~ eV, and these transitions will also be excited by the starlight background, and we may assume a characteristic rate for UV excitation

[formula]

What happens when the adsorbed species (which might be an atom X, a hydride XH, an oxide XO, a hydroxide XOH, ...) absorbs a UV photon and makes a transition to an electronically excited state? The answer is: it depends. Some materials (e.g., stainless steel or quartz) can undergo heavy ultraviolet irradiation without being affected. Other materials (e.g., polyethylene) are chemically altered by UV irradiation. Some physisorbed or chemisorbed species will undergo photoexcitation to an electronic excited state that may actually be repulsive with respect to the surface, resulting in ejection in a time ~  10- 13  s after being photoexcited. Laboratory studies of H2O and mixed ices irradiated by UV radiation [\citep=Westley+Baragiola+Johnson+Baratta_1995b] [\citep=Oberg+Linnartz+Visser+vanDishoeck_2009] [\citep=Oberg+vanDishoeck+Linnartz_2009] show that the surface erodes at a rate consistent with ejection of molecules from the surface monolayer with a high yield per photoexcitation in the surface monolayer.

Comparison of eq. (10-12) shows that a species X residing on a grain surface will have a good chance of encountering an impinging H atom before anything interesting happens, but will be very unlikely to encounter any other impinging species (e.g, C, O, Si) before undergoing photoexcitation. The adsorbed species will undergo [formula] photoexcitations before a monolayer of material (other than adsorbed H) can be deposited on top of it.

Because photoexcitation happens so frequently, the only materials that can form by accretion in the diffuse ISM are those that are not destroyed or altered by ultraviolet irradiation - this is what selects for amorphous silicate material and carbonaceous material as the two condensates. There may be other materials present, of course - e.g., Fe oxides, or even metallic Fe - but observations of interstellar dust appear to be consistent with amorphous silicates containing most of the condensed material that is not carbonaceous.

Ultraviolet irradiation may also explain how it is possible for the ISM to be able to grow two distinct grain materials - carbonaceous material and amorphous silicate material - out of a single gas mixture. One can imagine the following scenario: Suppose the grain population already has some amorphous silicate material exposed to the interstellar gas. When Mg, Si, Fe, and O atoms and ions arrive at the grain surface, they are able to grow additional amorphous silicate, adding one atom at a time. It may actually help to have ultraviolet radiation present, as the electronic excitations may allow chemical bonds to be rearranged to form amorphous silicate material as new O, Mg, Si, Fe atoms are added to the surface layer.

On the other hand, what happens when a C atom, for example, lands on the amorphous silicate surface? One can imagine that the C atom physisorbed on the amorphous silicate surface might undergo photoexcitation to an excited state that is repulsive, ejecting it from the surface. Or perhaps the C would become hydrogenated or oxidized, with the resulting CH or CO undergoing photodesorption from the surface. Such processes could keep the amorphous silicate carbon-free.

Similar processes may occur on exposed carbonaceous surfaces: impinging C atoms could grow new carbonaceous material, whereas impinging Mg, Si, Fe, etc. could be removed by some combination of reaction with impinging H or O, and photoexcitation by UV.

In this scenario, we can imagine the carbonaceous material and amorphous silicate material being in separate grains, or perhaps even as separate regions of a single grain. In the latter case, one would expect that when grain-grain collisions cause grains to shatter, the fragmentation would preferentially occur along interfaces between the two materials, leading to "pure" fragments.

Perhaps, then, the interstellar grain population actually is dominated by two distinct grain types: amorphous silicate grains and some form of carbonaceous material.

Growth of Dust at High z: the example of J114816+525150

Observations of quasars and luminous galaxies at high redshift have detected large masses of dust in a number of systems [\citep=Wang+Carilli+Wagg+etal_2008]. The prime example is the galaxy associated with the z = 6.42 QSO SDSS J114816+525150 (hereafter J1148+5251), with estimated dust mass Mdust ranging from [formula] [\citep=Dwek+Galliano+Jones_2007a] to [formula] [\citep=Bertoldi+Carilli+Cox+etal_2003]. Molecular gas appears to account for a large fraction of the [formula] dynamical mass [\citep=Walter+Carilli+Bertoldi+etal_2004]. With [formula], and [formula], this system has a dust/gas mass ratio Mdust / Mgas  >  0.004 - comparable to or exceeding the Milky Way value ~  0.005.

The time available for stellar evolution prior to z = 6.42 is limited: if star formation began at z = 10, the oldest stars are only 400 Myr old at z = 6.42, and only massive stars will have been able to evolve - low-mass stars have insufficient time to evolve to the asymptotic giant branch which dominates production of stardust in the Milky Way. This has led a number of authors to propose that supernovae are responsible for the dust in high-z galaxies [\citep=Maiolino+Schneider+Oliva+etal_2004] [\citep=Sugerman+Ercolano+Barlow+etal_2006] [\citep=Bianchi+Schneider_2007]. [\citet=Dwek+Galliano+Jones_2007a] discuss the dust in J1148+5251 and conclude that supernovae would have to produce [formula] of dust per supernova to explain the observations, but note that this is considerably in excess of what has been observed in SN ejecta.

J1148+5251 contains a large mass of molecular gas, detected in CO [formula], [formula], and [formula] [\citep=Bertoldi+Cox+Neri+etal_2003] [\citep=Walter+Carilli+Bertoldi+etal_2004]. The CO that is observed, and the H2 that must accompany the CO, is not supernova-produced: even if those molecules do form in the ejecta, they are efficiently destroyed by the reverse shock when the high-velocity ejecta are decelerated.

Instead, the H2 must be formed by the same mechanism that dominates H2 formation in the Milky Way: catalysis on grain surfaces. Given that the massive stars present in these galaxies will destroy H2 molecules - primarily through photodissociation - each H nucleon in the gas must, on average, have collided with grain surfaces many times in the age of this galaxy. Metal atoms and ions move only a few times more slowly than H, and will also collide with grain surfaces many times; if they stick, they will form new grain material. As discussed above, this is the process that dominates grain formation in the Milky Way, and there is no reason not to expect it to formation of grain material in J1148+5251.

Supernovae are of course required to produce the metals that compose the grains, and to provide some supernova-condensed "stardust" to provide "seed" surface area on which to grow more material in the ISM, but the bulk of the dust mass in high-z galaxies appears likely to be the result of grain growth competing successfully with grain destruction in the ISM.

Summary

The principal points of this paper are as follows:

The principal observational constraints on models for the interstellar grain population are summarized. The observed wavelength dependence of extinction (Fig. 1) and polarization of starlight, together with elemental abundances (total and observed in the gas) continue to provide the strongest constraints on what interstellar dust can be. Additional information is provided by infrared emission features at 3.3, 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.3, 12.0μm that are identified as coming from PAHs following single-photon heating.

A grain model consisting of a population of amorphous silicate spheres and a population of carbonaceous grains, including PAHs, can reproduce the observed wavelength-dependent extinction by dust. This model also successfully reproduces the observed infrared emission from interstellar dust (Figs. 2, 3).

If the amorphous silicate grains and carbonaceous grains are given spheroidal shapes, the observed polarization of starlight can also be reproduced.

The infrared emission spectra calculated for these spheroidal grain models (Fig. 4) are consistent with the observed infrared emission from high-latitude regions in the Milky Way. The models predict different degrees of polarization as a function of wavelength - observations with Planck will test these predictions.

The evolution of interstellar grains in the Milky Way is discussed. Grain destruction in the ISM is such that [formula]10% of the interstellar dust mass consists of "stardust" from stellar sources, including supernovae. The bulk of interstellar dust has been grown in the ISM.

The amorphous silicate and carbonaceous materials present in interstellar grains are the product of grain growth in the presence of strong ultraviolet radiation, that will photoexcite and possibly photodesorb species from the grain surface. The ultraviolet radiation may be key to maintaining separate populations of silicate and carbonaceous grains even though most grain growth occurs out of an average-composition ISM.

Dust in high-redshift systems such as J1148+5251 must be predominantly the result of grain growth in interstellar clouds. A small amount of dust from supernovae is sufficient to initiate grain growth in the ISM.
