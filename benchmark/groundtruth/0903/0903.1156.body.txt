On the solvability of systems of bilinear equations in finite fields

Introduction

In [\cite=s1], Sárközy proved that if A, B, C, D are "large" subsets of [formula], more precisely, |A||B||C||D|  ≫  p3, then the equation

[formula]

can be solved with a∈A, b∈B, c∈C and d∈D. Gyarmati and Sárközy [\cite=s2] generalized the results on the solvability of equation ([\ref=e1]) to finite fields. They also study the solvability of other (higher degree) algebraic equations with solutions restricted to "large" subsets of [formula], where [formula] denote the finite field of q elements. Using exponential sums, Hart and Iosevich [\cite=hart-iosevich] studied similar problem for any bilinear equation over [formula]. They showed that for any two sets [formula], with

[formula]

for some absolute constant C  >  0, the equation

[formula]

is solvable for any [formula]. Although the proof is given only in the case of the dot product, it goes through without any essential changes if the dot product [formula] is replaced by any non-degenerate bilinear form [formula]. Using bounds of multiplicative character sums, Shparlinski [\cite=igor] extended the class of sets which satisfy this property.

In this paper, we will use methods from graph theory to study the system of bilinear equations in finite fields. More precisely, we consider the following system

[formula]

over [formula], with variables from arbitrary sets [formula], [formula]. Our first result is the following.

Given k sets [formula] and let B(  ·  ,  ·  ) be a non-degenerate bilinear form in [formula]. Consider the system L of [formula] bilinear equations

[formula]

Suppose that each variable appears in at most t  ≤  k  -  1 equations and

[formula]

Then for any [formula], the above system has

[formula]

solutions.

The study of systems of bilinear equations in vector spaces over finite fields in the context of Theorem [\ref=general] in the case t = k - 1 can be found in Chapter 2 of D. Hart's dissertation [\cite=hart-thesis]. Theorem [\ref=general] is a quantitative improvement over the result given there.

The serious difficulties arise when the number of equations that each variable involves is sufficiently large with respect to the ambient dimension. More precisely, Theorem [\ref=general] is only non-trivial in the range d  ≥  2t. Even in the case of each variable appears in at most two equations, Theorem [\ref=general] is non non-trivial for d  ≥  4. The purpose of the following theorem is to fill in this gap. We show that the system of two bilinear equations and three variables in large restricted subsets of [formula] is always solvable for d  ≥  2.

Given three sets [formula] and let B(  ·  ,  ·  ) be a non-degenerate bilinear form in [formula]. Consider the system of two equations

[formula]

Suppose that

[formula]

then for any [formula], the above system has

[formula]

solutions.

The solvability of the system of three bilinear equations and three variables in large restricted subsets of [formula], however, is harder to determine. We will instead show that the system is solvable for a positive proportion of all triples [formula]. More precisely, we have the following theorem.

Given three sets [formula] and let B(  ·  ,  ·  ) be a non-degenerate bilinear form in [formula]. Consider the system of equations

[formula]

Suppose that

[formula]

then the above system is solvable for [formula]  triples [formula].

It is conceivable that we can chop off the term [formula] in the above theorem, or even better, the system is solvable for (1  -  o(1))q3 triples [formula]. We show that it is indeed the case when the ambient space has the dimension d  ≥  3.

Given three sets [formula] and let B(  ·  ,  ·  ) be a non-degenerate bilinear form in [formula]. Consider the system of equations

[formula]

Suppose that

[formula]

then the above system is solvable for (1  -  o(1))q3 triples [formula].

Note that there is a series of papers dealing with similar results in the sovability of systems of quadratic forms, for example, see [\cite=covert] [\cite=hart2] [\cite=hart3] [\cite=vinh1] [\cite=vinh2] [\cite=vinh3] [\cite=vinh4].

Bilinear equations in finite fields

Let B(  ·  ,  ·  ) be a nondegenerate bilinear form in [formula] and [formula]. For any [formula] and a subset [formula], denote [formula] be the set of all vectors [formula] such that [formula], and let [formula]. The following key estimate says that the cardinalities of [formula]'s are close to |V|  /  q when |V| is large.

For every subset V of [formula] then

[formula]

For any set X, let X(  ·  ) denote the characteristic function of X. Let χ be any non-trivial additive character of [formula]. We have

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

where R1 is taken over s  =  s' and R2 is taken over s  ≠  s'. We compute each term.

[formula]

where the last line follows from the orthogonality in [formula]. Now we compute R2.

[formula]

where the second line follows from the orthogonality in [formula]. The lemma follows immediately from ([\ref=h1]), ([\ref=h2]) and ([\ref=h3]).

The following result ([\cite=hart-iosevich]) is an easy corollary of Lemma [\ref=key].

([\cite=hart-iosevich]) Let B(  ·  ,  ·  ) be a nondegenerate bilinear form in [formula] and [formula]. For any two subsets [formula], denote Nλ(V,U) be the set of pairs [formula] such that [formula]. Then we have

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=key], we have

[formula]

By the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality,

[formula]

Theorem [\ref=12] has several applications in additive combinatorics (see [\cite=hart]). We present here another application of this theorem to Waring's problem (mod p). Let p be a prime and k a positive integer. The smallest s such that the congruence

[formula]

is solvable for all numbers a is called Waring's number (mod p), denote γ(k,p) (see [\cite=cipra] for a historical background and recent results on this problem). Let γ*(k,p) denote the smallest s such that the congruence ([\ref=w]) is solvable for all a  ≠  0. It is clear that γ(k,p)  ≤  γ*(k,p) + 1. Take A be the set of all k-power in [formula], and let [formula]. From Theorem [\ref=12], the congruence ([\ref=w]) with s = d is solvable for all a  ≠  0 if [formula]. It follows that γ*(k,p)  ≤  d whenever γ*(k,p). This essentially matches with the classical bound of Weil in [\cite=weil].

General systems of bilinear equations

Now we give a proof of Theorem [\ref=general]. The proof is very similar to that of [\cite=pseudo]. Consider a random one-to-one mapping of the set of variables of L into the sets [formula]. Let M(L) denote the event that all equations in L are satisfied under this mapping. We say that the mapping is an embedding of L in such a case. It suffices to prove that

[formula]

We prove ([\ref=5]) by induction on l, the number of equations in L. The base case l  =  0 is trivial. Suppose that the theorem holds for all systems of less than l equations. Let [formula], [formula], [formula], be an equation of L. Let [formula] be the subsystems obtained from L by removing all equations that contain [formula], [formula], [formula], respectively. And let [formula] be the subsystem obtained from L by removing the equation [formula]. We have

[formula]

Let l1 be the number of equations in [formula]. Since ([\ref=5]) holds for [formula] and [formula], we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

Therefore, we have

[formula]

For an embedding f1 of [formula] into [formula], let [formula], [formula] and [formula] be the number of extensions of f1 to an embedding of [formula] and [formula] into [formula], respectively. Note that an extension [formula] of f1 to an embedding of [formula] and an extension [formula] of f1 to an embedding of [formula] give us a unique extension of f1 to an embedding of [formula]. Hence,

[formula]

Averaging over all possible extensions of f1 to a mapping from [formula] into [formula], we have Taking expectation over all embedding f1, the LHS becomes

[formula]

So we get

[formula]

Now, let f be a random one-to-one mapping of the set of variables of L into the sets [formula]. Let f1 be a fixed embedding of [formula]. Let A'2 and A'1 be the set of all possible images of [formula] and [formula] over all possible extensions of f1 to embeddings of [formula] and [formula] into [formula], respectively. From Theorem [\ref=12], the number of possible pairs [formula] with [formula] and [formula] such that [formula] is bounded by

[formula]

Thus, we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

Averaging over all possible embeddings f1, we get

[formula]

where the second lines follows from ([\ref=v4]) and ([\ref=11]). By Jensen's inequality, we have

[formula]

which is negligible to the first term as

[formula]

Thus, we have

[formula]

This completes the proof of the theorem.

The system of two equations and three variables

We will prove Theorem [\ref=23] in this section. Our proof relies on Lemma [\ref=key] above. For any [formula] and a subset [formula], denote [formula] be the set of all vectors [formula] such that [formula], and let [formula]. The number of solutions of the system ([\ref=23s]) is

[formula]

From Lemma [\ref=key], we have

[formula]

Thus, by the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality, we have

[formula]

This implies that

[formula]

From Theorem [\ref=12], we have

[formula]

Putting ([\ref=v1]), ([\ref=v2]) and ([\ref=v3]) together, it follows that

[formula]

completing the proof of the theorem.

The system of three equations and three variables

The case d  =  2 (Proof of Theorem [\ref=332])

Let [formula], [formula] and [formula] then

[formula]

For any [formula], it follows from Theorem [\ref=23] that

[formula]

By the pigeon-hole principle, there exists [formula] such that

[formula]

Let [formula]. Let

[formula]

then |B1||C1|  ≫  δ2q2. We assume that |C1|  ≥  |B1|, then |C1|  ≥  δq. It suffices to show that there are at least δq values of λ such that

[formula]

For a fix [formula], we want to solve the following system

[formula]

under the constraint [formula]. Suppose that [formula] for some [formula]. Let [formula], [formula] and [formula], the system ([\ref=t1]) becomes

[formula]

This implies that κ(a2b1  -  a1b2)c2  =  λ2b1  -  λa1. Thus the system has at most one solution if a2b1  -  a1b2  ≠  0. If a2b1  =  a1b2, the system is solvable only if λ  =  λ2b1  /  a1. Besides, from the first equation, (κa22  +  a21)b2  =  λ1a2 and (κa22  +  a21)b1  =  λ1a1. It follows that the system ([\ref=t1]) has at most one solution if

[formula]

Since |C*|  ≤  q, |B1|  ≥  δ2q  ≫  1. Thus, we can choose [formula] satisfying ([\ref=t2]). The system ([\ref=t1]) has at most one solution for each λ. So there exists at least |C1|  ≥  δq values of λ such that the system ([\ref=t1]) is solvable. This completes the proof of the theorem.

The case d  ≥  3 (Proof of Theorem [\ref=333])

Let [formula], [formula] and [formula]. For any [formula], it follows from Theorem [\ref=23] that

[formula]

By the pigeon-hole principle, there exists [formula] such that

[formula]

For any [formula], set [formula]. Let

[formula]

then |B1||C1|  ≫  qd. Theorem [\ref=333] follows immediately from the following lemma.

For any [formula] and [formula], suppose that [formula], [formula]. If d  ≥  3 and |E||F|  ≫  qd, then

[formula]

The proof is similar to that of [\cite=hart]. Define the incidence function

[formula]

The Fourier transform of a complex-valued function f on [formula] with respect to a non-trivial additive character χ on [formula] is given by

[formula]

and the Fourier inversion formula takes the form

[formula]

Using exponential sums, Hart, Iosevich, Koh, and Rudnev ([\cite=hart]) showed that

[formula]

where

[formula]

Since [formula], [formula] and [formula] for any [formula]. Therefore,

[formula]

By the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality, we have

[formula]

This implies that

[formula]

This follows that if |E||F|  ≫  qd then |Π(E,F)|  =  q(1  -  o(1)), completing the proof of the lemma.
