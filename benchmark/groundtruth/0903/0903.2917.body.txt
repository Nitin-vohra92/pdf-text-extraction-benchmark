The Corona Factorization property, Stability, and the Cuntz semigroup of a C*-algebra

Introduction

The Corona Factorization Property was defined and studied by Kucerovsky and Ng in [\cite=KN] building on work by Elliott and Kucerovsky, [\cite=EK], in which purely large s were studied. Both concepts relate to the theory of extensions and in particular to the important question on when extensions are automatically absorbing.

A C*-algebra satisfies the Corona Factorization Property if every full projection in the multiplier algebra of its stabilization is properly infinite (and hence equivalent to the unit). The existence of non-properly infinite full projections in the multiplier algebra of a stable C*-algebra was noted (implicitly) in [\cite=Ro2], and more explicitly in [\cite=Ro4], in connection with the construction of non-stable C*-algebra s that become stable when being tensored with a matrix algebra. The existence of finite full projections in the multiplier algebra of a stable C*-algebra was also essential in the construction in [\cite=Ro3] of a simple C*-algebra with a finite and an infinite projection. In the language of Kucerovsky and Ng it is shown in [\cite=Ro3] that the C*-algebra [formula] does not have the Corona Factorization Property.

Zhang proved a (partial) converse of these results, that a simple C*-algebra of real rank zero with the Corona Factorization Property is either stably finite or purely infinite.

It thus appears that failure to have the Corona Factorization Property is an "infinite dimensional" property, and conversely that all C*-algebra s with "finite dimensional behavior" should have the Corona Factorization Property. (By finite and infinite dimensinality we are, of course, not referring to the vector space dimension of the C*-algebra, but rather to its non-commutative dimension--perhaps best defined through Kirchberg and Winter's notion of decomposition rank.) Pimsner, Popa, and Voiculescu studied in [\cite=PPV] extensions of [formula], where X is a finite-dimensional compact metric space, and developed an [formula] theory. It follows in particular from their work that [formula] has the Corona Factorization Property when X has finite dimension. The assumption that X is finite dimensional is crucial.

Using Kirchberg and Winter notion of decomposition rank, [\cite=KW], mentioned above, Kucerovsky and Ng, [\cite=KN2], studied extensions of type I C*-algebras with finite decomposition.

In this paper we show that a σ-unital C*-algebra (simple or not) satisfies the Corona Factorization Property if, and only if, its Cuntz semigroup satisfies a very weak comparison property that we call the Corona Factorization Property for semigroups (also considered in [\cite=OPR]). We also introduce stronger notions of comparison for ordered abelian semigroups, some of which are verified for the Cuntz semigroup of a unital C*-algebra with finite decomposition rank, and so the Corona Factorization Property also holds for these algebras.

This parallels the property that the authors introduced and examined in the article [\cite=OPR]. There it was shown, using entirely different techniques than those employed here, that a σ-unital C*-algebra of real rank zero has the Corona Factorization Property if and only if its monoid V(A) of Murray-von Neumann equivalence classes of projections in the stabilization of a C*-algebra A has the Corona Factorization Property (for monoids).

In outline the paper is as follows. In Section [\ref=sec:semigroups], we define and consider various comparability properties for ordered abelian semigroups, including n-comparison and ω-comparison (and their weak counterparts), and the Corona Factorization Property for semigroups. These properties can be viewed as weakened forms of the almost unperforation property for semigroups (considered in [\cite=Ro1]). In fact, an ordered abelian semigroup has the 0-comparison property if and only if it is almost unperforated. It follows from a result of Toms and Winter, [\cite=TW], that the Cuntz semigroup of any unital simple C*-algebra with decomposition rank n has the n-comparison property (and hence also ω-comparison and the Corona Factorization Property). It was this result by Toms and Winter that led us to consider n-comparison.

In Section [\ref=sec:CFP] we establish (using the above mentioned result of Toms and Winter) that the Cuntz semigroup of (non-simple) unital C*-algebra s with finite decomposition rank has the weak n-comparison property, and hence also the Corona Factorization property. After the first version of this paper was posted Leonel Robert proved that the Cuntz semigroup of any C*-algebra with nuclear dimension at most n (respectively, ω) has n-comparison (respectively, ω-comparison), [\cite=Robert].

In Section [\ref=sec:stable] we consider an intrinsic property (that we call property (S)) of a C*-algebra defined in terms of Cuntz' comparison theory for C*-algebra s, and we show that it is equivalent to the absence of unital quotients and bounded 2-quasitraces. It is further shown that property (S) is equivalent to stability of a C*-algebra if its Cuntz semigroup has the ω-comparison property, thus generalizing a result from [\cite=HRW].

In Section [\ref=sec:CFP_Cuntz] we prove our main result, that a σ-unital C*-algebra has the Corona Factorization Property if and only if its Cuntz semigroup satisfies the comparability condition called the Corona Factorization Property (for semigroups), and that every ideal in a σ-unital C*-algebra has the Corona Factorization Property if and only if its Cuntz semigroup satisfies the strong Corona Factorization Property (for semigroups).

Comparability in ordered abelian semigroups

In this section we shall discuss a number of comparability properties of ordered abelian semigroups.

Consider an ordered abelian semigroup (W, + ,  ≤  ) that we here and in what is to follow tacitly shall assume to be positive, i.e., x  ≤  x + z for all x,z∈W. We do not assume that the order is the algebraic one, given by x  ≤  y if and only if y  =  x + z for some z in W.

A state on W normalized at x∈W is an additive order preserving map from W into [formula] that maps x to 1. The set of all states normalized at x is denoted by S(W,x). Given two elements x,y∈W, one writes [formula] if there exists [formula] such that x  ≤  ny.

The result below has appeared already in several versions in the literature, perhaps first as the extension result of Goodearl and Handelman in [\cite=GH:Extending]. We wish to emphasize the following formulation that will be essential for our paper.

Let (W, + ,  ≤  ) be an ordered abelian semigroup, and let x,y∈W. Then the following statements are equivalent:

There exists [formula] such that (k + 1)x  ≤  ky.

There exists [formula] such that (k + 1)x  ≤  ky for every k  ≥  k0.

[formula] and f(x) < f(y) for every f∈S(W,y).

If S(W,y) is empty, then statement (iii) above reduces to the statement [formula].

(iii) ⇒   (i). Assume first that y is an order unit for W and that (iii) holds. Use compactness of S(W,y) to find natural numbers m  >  m' such that f(mx)  <  f(m'y) for all f∈S(W,y). By the results of Goodearl and Handelman in [\cite=GH:Extending] there exist a natural number n and an element z in W such that nmx  +  z  ≤  nm'y  +  z. From this inequality we get rnmx  +  z  ≤  rnm'y  +  z for all natural numbers r. Now, z  ≤  py for some natural number p (because y was assumed to be an order unit). This gives us rnmx  ≤  (rnm' + p)y for all natural numbers r. Choose r large enough so that rnm  >  rnm' + p and put k = rnm' + p. Then (k + 1)x  ≤  rnmx  ≤  ky.

If y is not an order unit, then consider the order ideal W' in W generated by y (i.e., W' consists of all elements w such that [formula]). Then y is an order unit in W' and x belongs to W'. Moreover, every state in S(W,y) restricts to a state in S(W',y); and every state in S(W',y) extends to a state in S(W,y) by letting it attain the value ∞   in [formula]. In this way we can reduce the general case to the case dealt with above where y is an order unit.

(ii) ⇒   (iii). This is contained in the proof of [\cite=Ro1], but here it comes again: First, if (k + 1)x  ≤  ky, then x  ≤  ky, so [formula]. Second, (k + 1)x  ≤  ky implies that f(x)  ≤  k(k + 1)- 1  <  1  =  f(y) for every f∈S(W,y).

(i) ⇒   (ii). Suppose (m + 1)x  ≤  my for some positive integer m. Put k0  =  (m + 1)m. For each k  ≥  k0 write k  =  (m + 1)r  +  s, where r and s are non-negative integers with s  ≤  m. Note that necessarily r  ≥  m. Therefore

[formula]

Let us briefly remind the reader about the ordered Cuntz semigroup(s) W(A) and [formula] associated to a C*-algebra A introduced by Cuntz in [\cite=Cun]. The (uncompleted) Cuntz semigroup W(A) arises as M∞(A)+  /     ≈  , where M∞(A)+ denote the positive elements in the disjoint union [formula], and where ≈   is Cuntz equivalence: For a∈Mn(A)+ and b∈Mm(A)+ write [formula] if x*kbxk  →  a for some sequence {xk} in Mm,n(A), and write a  ≈  b if [formula] and [formula]. Equip W(A) with addition arising from direct sum [formula], and with the order induced by [formula]. Let 〈a〉∈W(A) denote the equivalence class containing a.

In [\cite=CEI], Coward, Elliott, and Ivanescu introduced a modified version of the Cuntz semigroup, [formula]. They use suitable equivalence classes of countably generated Hilbert modules (which, in the case of stable rank one, amount to isomorphism) to obtain an ordered abelian semigroup, which in certain good situations can be viewed as the completion of W(A), see [\cite=ABP], and which turns out to be order-isomorphic to [formula]. Unlike the functor A  ↦  W(A), the new Cuntz semigroup functor [formula] is continuous; and [formula] is closed under suprema of increasing sequences.

Coward, Elliott, and Ivanescu also formalize the notion of compact containment in the Cuntz semigroup to arbitrary ordered abelian semigroups W that admit suprema of increasing sequences as follows: Given two elements x,y in W, x is compactly contained in y, sometimes colloquially referred to as x is way below y, and denoted by x  ≪  y, if whenever {yn} is an increasing sequence with supremum greater than or equal to y, eventually x  ≤  yn.

A proto-example of compact containment in the Cuntz semigroup is 〈(a - ε)+〉  ≪  〈a〉 that holds in [formula] for all C*-algebra s A, for all positive elements [formula], and for all ε > 0.

The Cuntz semigroup [formula] is complete and in fact belongs to the category Cu, defined in [\cite=CEI], which is the appropriate frame in which to study this object. For our purposes the weaker notion of completeness will suffice.

Identifying A and matrix algebras over A as hereditary subalgebras of [formula] we can regard W(A) as being a subsemigroup of [formula]. Each positive element a in A or in a matrix algebra over A defines a class 〈a〉 in [formula].

Given a,b∈A+ write [formula] to denote the n-fold direct sum [formula]. Clearly, [formula] in [formula]. Write [formula] if 〈a〉  <  s〈b〉. About this relation we have the lemma below, which is similar to [\cite=Ro:UHFII].

Let a and b be positive elements in a C*-algebra A and suppose that [formula]. Then, for each ε  >  0 there exists δ  >  0 such that [formula].

For c∈A+ note that [formula].

There exists a positive integer k such that (k + 1)〈a〉  ≤  k〈b〉. Hence [formula]. Let ε > 0. It then follows from [\cite=Ro:UHFII] that there exists δ > 0 such that

[formula]

This shows that [formula].

Let us note some properties that can be deduced from [\cite=Ro:UHFII] and Lemma [\ref=ep-delta]. If [formula], then

x  ≤  y if and only if x0  ≤  y for every [formula] with x0  ≪  x;

if x  ≤  y and if [formula] is such that x0  ≪  x, then there is [formula] with y0  ≪  y and x0  ≤  y0;

if x  <  sy and if [formula] is such that x0  ≪  x, then there is [formula] with y0  ≪  y and x0  <  sy0.

Our first comparability property, given in Definition [\ref=def:n-comp] below, is prompted by a result of Toms and Winter, [\cite=TW]. Recall that if τ is a positive trace (or a 2-quasitrace) in A, then one can associate to it a dimension function [formula] given by

[formula]

where a is a positive element in [formula] and [formula] is the usual extension of τ to [formula]. The trace property ensures that dτ is well-defined. We can also view dτ as being a function on the positive elements in [formula]. We shall not distinguish between the two situations.

Let A be a simple, separable, and unital C*-algebra of decomposition rank n  <    ∞  . Let [formula] be positive elements in A such that dτ(a)  <  dτ(dj) for [formula] and for all tracial states τ on A (where dτ is the dimension function on A associated with the trace τ). It follows that

[formula]

in the Cuntz semigroup [formula].

Note that W has the 0-comparison property if and only if W is almost unperforated, cf. Remark [\ref=rem:almunp]. Note also, that if W has the n-comparison property for some n, then it has the m-comparison property for all m  ≥  n.

With Definition [\ref=def:n-comp] at hand we can rephrase the proposition of Toms and Winter above as follows:

Let A be a simple, separable and unital C*-algebra with decomposition rank n  <    ∞  . Then W(A) and [formula] have the n-comparison property.

By Lemma [\ref=n-comp:W-Cu] below it suffices to show this for W(A).

Let [formula] be such that x < syj for every [formula]. Upon replacing A by a matrix algebra over A (which does not change the decomposition rank) we may assume that there are positive elements [formula] in A such that x  =  〈a〉 and yj  =  〈dj〉.

We know from Proposition [\ref=stable_comparison] that f(x) < f(yj) for every dimension function f on A normalized at yj. As A is simple and unital, every such f is a multiple of a dimension function which is normalized at the unit: 〈1A〉. It follows that dτ(a)  <  dτ(dj) for every tracial state τ on A (because dτ then is a dimension function on A normalized at 1A) Thus, by [\cite=TW] (which in fact is Proposition [\ref=prop:tw]), we get that [formula], which in turn implies that [formula], as desired.

As mentioned in the introduction, Leonel Robert improved this result after the first version of this paper was made public, see [\cite=Robert].

Let A be a C*-algebra, and suppose that W(A) has the n-comparison property. Then [formula] has the n-comparison property.

Let [formula] in [formula] be given satisfying x  <  syj for all j. As x is the supremum of an increasing sequence of elements {xk} from W(A) each satisfying xk  ≪  x it suffices to show that [formula] for every x'∈W(A) with x'  ≪  x. Each yj is likewise the supremum of an increasing sequence {y(k)j} of elements from W(A). Use property (c) above to conclude that there is a natural number k such that x'  <  sy(k)j holds for all j. As the inclusion mapping [formula] is an order embedding, the inequality x'  <  sy(k)j also holds in W(A). It follows that [formula] as desired.

We proceed to define a comparison property which is weaker than the n-comparison property for all n.

It is clear that if W has the n-comparison property for some n, then W also has the ω-comparison property.

We shall now (re-)define two even weaker comparison properties for an ordered abelian semigroup, the strong Corona Factorization Property and the Corona Factorization Property. These were also defined (slightly differently) in our paper, [\cite=OPR], written in parallel with this paper. In [\cite=OPR] we were interested in the case of the (discrete) algebraically ordered semigroup, V(A), of Murray-von Neumman equivalence classes of projections. In the present case of the Cuntz semigroup, one has to take into consideration its continuous aspect where the definition below is more appropriate (and it extends the definition given in [\cite=OPR], see Remark [\ref=rem:int]). We shall sometimes refer to the definitions of the Corona Factorization Property in [\cite=OPR] as the discrete versions and the ones given below as the continuous verions.

Fullness, as defined below, was also considered in [\cite=OPR], and again we must extend this definition so that it applies to complete ordered (positive) semigroups.

Every order unit in W is full, but the reverse is not always true. The constant sequence {xn}, with xn  =  x for all n, is full if and only if x is full.

Suppose that A is a C*-algebra and that {an} is a sequence of positive elements in A. Then {〈an〉} is full in [formula] if and only if [formula] and {an} is full in A (in the sense of {an} not being contained in a proper closed two-sided ideal in A).

It is clear that any semigroup that satisfies the strong Corona Factorization Property also satisfies the Corona Factorization Property. It was shown in [\cite=OPR] that a conical refinement monoid satisfies the strong Corona Factorization Property if and only if every ideal of the monoid satisfies the Corona Factorization Property. It is not clear if this remains true without assuming the refinement property, but we shall show (implicit in Theorem [\ref=sCFP-C*-alg]) that this also holds for semigroups arising as the Cuntz semigroup of a σ-unital C*-algebra. We shall also see, as in the case of C*-algebra s with real rank zero, that the Corona Factorization Property defined for semigroups matches the corresponding property for the C*-algebra s (see Section 5).

If W is an algebraically ordered semigroup, then the definitions given above for the (strong) Corona Factorization Property agree with the corresponding ones in [\cite=OPR]. The connection between the two notions is discussed in the remark below.

Any complete abelian ordered semigroup, which satisfies the ω-comparison property, also satisfies the Corona Factorization Property.

Let W be a complete abelian ordered semigroup with the ω-comparison property. Let {xn} be a full sequence in W, let {yn} be another sequence in W, let x'∈W, and let m be a positive integer such that x'  ≪  x1 and xn  ≤  myn for all n. For each integer n  ≥  0 put

[formula]

Then

[formula]

whence x1  <  szn for all n. It follows that [formula] for some n, which entails that [formula].

We shall finally consider the following notion of n-comparison that only involves full elements of the semigroup. (This shall be appropriate for studying the Corona Factorization Property for non-simple C*-algebra s of finite decomposition rank.)

The weak n- and the weak ω-comparison properties only makes sense for semigroups that contain a full element (if they don't, then they automatically possess this property). It is clear that if W satisfies the weak n-comparison property for some n, then it satisfies the weak m-comparison property for all m  ≥  n and it satisfies the weak ω-comparison property.

We show below that if W(A) has the weak n-comparison property then so does [formula]. A new definition and a lemma is required for the proof.

We say that an element d in a C*-algebra A is strictly full if (d - ε)+ is full for some ε  >  0, and hence for all sufficiently small ε  >  0. Note that any full projection automatically is strictly full. The lemma below characterizes C*-algebra s whose primitive ideal space is compact (or, equivalently, C*-algebra s that do not contain proper dense algebraic ideals):

Let A be a C*-algebra such that [formula] contains a strictly full positive element. Then every full positive element in A is strictly full.

View A as a full hereditary sub-C*-algebra of its stabilization [formula]. Let a be a strictly full positive element in [formula] and choose δ > 0 such that (a - δ)+ is full in [formula]. Let d be an arbitrary full positive element in A. For each ε > 0 consider the closed two-sided ideal [formula] of [formula] generated by (d - ε)+. The closure of [formula] is a closed two-sided ideal in [formula] which contains d and hence is equal to [formula]. Consequently, [formula] is a dense (algebraic) ideal in [formula], which therefore contains the Pedersen ideal of [formula], which again contains (a - δ)+. It follows that (a - δ)+ belongs to [formula] for some ε > 0, whence [formula], which again implies that (d - ε)+ is full (in [formula] and hence in A).

If A is as above, if [formula] is a full element, and if {xk} is an increasing sequence in [formula] with x  =   sup kxk, then xk is full for all sufficiently large k. Indeed, there is a (necessarily strictly full) positive element a in [formula] such that x  =  〈a〉. Find ε  >  0 such that (a - ε)+ is (strictly) full. It follows that x'  =  〈(a - ε)+〉 is full. As x'  ≪  x we have x'  ≤  yk for all large enough k, and an element is full if it dominates a full element.

Let A be a C*-algebra, and assume that [formula] contains a strictly full element and that W(A) has the weak n-comparison property. Then [formula] has the weak n-comparison property.

We proceed exactly as in the proof of Lemma [\ref=n-comp:W-Cu], but now have that the yj's in that proof are full in [formula]. It follows from Lemma [\ref=lem_full] above (and the remarks below it) that the y(k)j's (from the proof of Lemma [\ref=n-comp:W-Cu]) are full (in [formula] and therefore also in W(A)) for all large enough k. We therefore obtain the desired conclusion as in the proof of Lemma [\ref=n-comp:W-Cu].

Any complete abelian ordered semigroup, which satisfies the weak ω-comparison property and which contains a full element that is compactly contained in another (full) element, also satisfies the Corona Factorization Property.

Let W be a complete abelian ordered semigroup with the weak ω-comparison property. By assumption there are elements v  ≪  w in W such that v is full.

Let {xk} be a full sequence in W, let {yk} be another sequence in W, let x'∈W, and let m be a positive integer such that x'  ≪  x and xk  ≤  myk for all k. By the definition of a full sequence (applied to v  ≪  w) we have that [formula] for all large enough k. Hence [formula] for all large enough k, whence yk is full whenever k is large enough. Upon removing the first finitely many elements from the sequences {xk} and {yk} we can assume that all yk are full.

Let now [formula] be as in the proof of Proposition [\ref=omega-CFP] above. Then [formula] are full and x1  <  szj for all j. It follows that

[formula]

for some n, whence W has the Corona Factorization Property.

In conclusion, we have defined the following comparability properties of a complete ordered abelian semigroup, listed in decreasing strength: 0-comparison (which is the same as being almost unperforated), 1-comparison, 2-comparison, [formula], ω-comparison, the strong Corona Factorization Property, and the Corona Factorization Property for semigroups. Moreover, we have defined weak n- and the weak ω-comparison properties. We show below that the comparison properties above are in fact strictly decreasing in strength. An example a complete abelian ordered semigroup that has the strong Corona Factorization Property but not the ω-comparison property is constructed in [\cite=BoRo]. (That the strong Corona Factorization Property is strictly stronger than the Corona Factorization Property was already noted in [\cite=OPR].)

The Corona Factorization Property for C*-algebra s with finite decomposition rank

We have already mentioned the result, [\cite=TW], of Toms and Winter which implies that the Cuntz semigroup of a simple unital separable C*-algebra has n-comparison property. We wish to extend this result to the non-simple case, and state for this purpose a lemma whose proof actually is contained in the proof of [\cite=TW] (follow that proof from Equation (10) to its end) and therefore is omitted.

Let A be a separable C*-algebra with finite decomposition rank n. Suppose that [formula] and α > 0 satisfy

[formula]

where dτ is the dimension function associated to τ as in [\eqref=eq:d_tau]. Then [formula].

Let A be a separable, unital C*-algebra with decomposition rank n  <    ∞  . Then W(A) and [formula] have the weak n-comparison property.

By Lemma [\ref=wn-comp:W-Cu] it suffices to prove the proposition for W(A).

Let [formula] with yi full and x < syi be given for every i. Then, by Proposition [\ref=stable_comparison], there exists k such that (k + 1)x  ≤  kyi for all i.

As [formula] are full, there is a natural number N such that 〈1A〉  ≤  Nyi for all i. Choose 0 < α' < (k + 1)- 1 and let α  =  α' / N. Let now f∈S(W(A),〈1A〉). We then have that 1  ≤  Nf(yi) for all i, whence α < f(yi) / (k + 1). Therefore:

[formula]

for all i.

In particular, dτ(x)  <  dτ(yi)  -  α for all i and for every tracial state τ on A

Finite decomposition rank passes to matrices, so upon replacing A with a matrix algebra over A, we can suppose that there exist positive elements a and [formula] in A, with di full, such that x = 〈a〉 and yi  =  〈di〉 for all i. Then dτ(a)  <  dτ(di)  -  α for all i and for all tracial states τ on A. Lemma [\ref=TW_nonsimple] then implies that [formula], which again implies that [formula] as desired.

Combining Proposition  [\ref=weak_CFP] and Proposition [\ref=lema_princ] we get:

Let A be a separable, unital C*-algebra with finite decomposition rank. Then [formula] has the Corona Factorization Property.

Stability of C*-algebras

We show in this section that a C*-algebra whose Cuntz semigroup has the ω-comparison property is stable if and only if it has no unital quotient and no bounded 2-quasitrace. We introduce a property (S) of a C*-algebra that we show is equivalent to having no non-zero unital quotients and no bounded 2-quasitraces.

It was shown in [\cite=HR] that a separable C*-algebra A is stable if and only if to every a∈F(A) there exists b∈A+ such that [formula] and [formula]. (The set F(A) consists of all positive elements a in A for which a  =  ae for some positive element e in A (that can be taken to be a contraction).) We shall here consider a weaker version of this condition, where we replace the relation [formula] with the relation [formula] considered in Section [\ref=sec:semigroups].

It follows immediately from the definition, the results from [\cite=HR] quoted above, and from Remark [\ref=rem:almunp], that if A is a separable C*-algebra for which [formula] is almost unperforated, then A has property (S) if and only if A is stable. It is easy to see that every stable C*-algebra has property (S).

Let A be a separable C*-algebra with property (S). Then A has no non-zero unital quotients.

Let I be an ideal of A such that A / I is unital. Let e + I be the unit of A / I, with e∈A+. Upon replacing e with g(e), where [formula] is a continuous function which vanishes on, say

[formula]

Let A be a separable C*-algebra with property (S). Then given any a∈F(A) there exists b∈F(A) such that

[formula]

If, moreover, [formula] is assumed to contain a strictly full positive element, then b above can be chosen to be strictly full in A.

Let a∈F(A), and choose d in A+ with da = ad = a. Let [formula] be a continuous function which is zero on

[formula]

e ∈ F(A),   ea=ae=a,   a (e-1/2),   e=1.

[formula]

(e+f)(a+b) = ea+fb = a+b.

[formula]

Let A be a separable C*-algebra with property (S). Then for every a∈F(A) there is a sequence [formula] of elements in F(A) such that the elements [formula] are pairwise orthogonal, [formula] belongs to F(A) for all n, and such that [formula].

If, moreover, [formula] is assumed to contain a strictly full positive element, then [formula] above can be chosen to be strictly full in A.

The existence of b0 such that [formula], [formula], and a + b0 belongs to F(A) follows from Lemma [\ref=lem01]. Suppose that n  ≥  0 and that [formula] have been found such that [formula] are pairwise orthogonal, [formula], and [formula] belongs to F(A). Then, by Lemma [\ref=lem01], there is bn + 1 in F(A) which is orthogonal to the sum [formula] (and hence to each of the summands), such that [formula] (and hence [formula]) and such that [formula] belongs to F(A).

Finally, use Lemma [\ref=lem01] to see that each of the positive elements bj above can be chosen to be strictly full if [formula] contains a strictly full positive element.

We will now give an algebraic characterization of property (S) for a C*-algebra. The characterization is very similar to, but sharpens, [\cite=HRW]. The reader is referred to [\cite=BH] for the definition and properties of 2-quasitraces. Let us just here remind the reader than any 2-quasitrace on an exact C*-algebra is a trace, and that the shortcoming of a quasitrace (compared with a trace) is that it only is assumed to be additive on commuting elements.

Let A be a separable C*-algebra. Then A has property (S) if and only if A has no non-zero bounded lower semi-continuous 2-quasitrace and no non-zero unital quotient.

The "if" part is contained in the proof of [\cite=HRW].

To prove the "only if" part, suppose that A has property (S). By Lemma [\ref=lema00], A has no non-zero unital quotients. Suppose, to reach a contradiction, that τ is a non-zero bounded 2-quasitrace on A, and let dτ be the associated lower semicontinuous dimension function on W(A) (cf., Equation [\eqref=eq:d_tau]). Since τ is non-zero there is a positive element a in A such that dτ(a) > 0, and since dτ is lower semicontinuous, dτ((a - ε)+)  >  0 for some ε > 0. We can now use Lemma [\ref=rema_ortho] to find a sequence [formula] of pairwise orthogonal elements in F(A) such that [formula]. By Proposition [\ref=stable_comparison] we have [formula], and in particular

[formula]

On the other hand, one has [formula] for all c in A+, and so the inequality above is in contradiction with the assumed boundedness of τ.

It is well-known that stability is not a stable property (see [\cite=Ro2]). Property (S), however, is a stable property, as easily follows from Proposition [\ref=prop1] above:

Let A be a separable C*-algebra. Then the following conditions are equivalent:

A has property (S).

Mn(A) has property (S) for some natural number n.

Mn(A) has property (S) for all natural numbers n.

By Proposition [\ref=prop1] it suffices to check that each of the two properties: having a non-zero unital quotient, and having a non-zero bounded 2-quasitrace, passes to matrix algebras and back again. This is trivial for the first. It is a theorem (see [\cite=BH]) that 2-quasitraces extend to all matrix algebras (and vice versa).

The result, [\cite=HRW], that we have used extensively in the proof of Proposition [\ref=prop1] above, actually says that a separable C*-algebra with almost unperforated Cuntz semigroup is stable if and only if it has no non-zero unital quotient and no non-zero bounded 2-quasitrace. Reminding the reader that almost unperforation is the same as the "0-comparison" property, we can extend [\cite=HRW] as follows:

Let A be a separable C*-algebra such that [formula] satisfies the ω-comparison property (cf. Definition [\ref=def:wcomp]). Let B be a hereditary sub-C*-algebra of [formula]. Then the following conditions are equivalent:

B is stable

B has no non-zero unital quotient and no non-zero bounded 2-quasitrace.

B has property (S).

Conditions (ii) and (iii) are equivalent for all separable C*-algebra s by Proposition [\ref=prop1], and (i) clearly implies (ii) (again for all C*-algebra s) (see eg. [\cite=HR]).

(iii) ⇒   (i). By [\cite=HR] it is enough to show that for every a∈B+ and every ε > 0 there exists b∈B+ such that [formula] and [formula]. (Indeed, if such an element b exists, then (a - 2ε)+  =  x*bx for some x∈B; whence [formula], and [formula].)

Since (a - ε / 2)+ belongs to F(B) we can apply Lemma [\ref=rema_ortho] to get a sequence of positive elements [formula] in F(B) such that [formula] and for which [formula] are mutually orthogonal. The corresponding elements

[formula]

in [formula] satisfy x'  ≪  x and x  <  syj for all j. By the assumption that [formula] satisfies the ω-comparison property there is a natural number n such that [formula]. Thus, [formula] (relatively to [formula] and therefore also relatively to the hereditary sub-C*-algebra B of [formula]) and [formula] as desired.

We have the following analog of Proposition [\ref=prop2], where the assumption on the comparison property of the Cuntz semigroup is weakened, but where we instead have to assume the existence of a full projection:

Let A be a separable C*-algebra such that [formula] satisfies the weak ω-comparison property and such that [formula] contains a full projection. Let B be a full hereditary sub-C*-algebra of [formula]. Then the following conditions are equivalent:

B is stable

B has no non-zero unital quotient and no non-zero bounded 2-quasitrace.

B has property (S).

Proceeding as in the proof of Proposition [\ref=prop2], we only need to prove (iii) ⇒   (i); and to prove that (i) holds it suffices to show that for every a∈B+ and every ε > 0 there exists b∈B+ such that [formula] and [formula].

Since [formula] contains a full projection (which automatically is strictly full), it follows from Lemma [\ref=lem_full] that all full positive elements in [formula] are strictly full. As B is separable, it contains a full (positive) element, which is then full in [formula] and hence is strictly full in [formula] and therefore also strictly full in B. Apply Lemma [\ref=rema_ortho] to get full positive elements [formula] in F(B) such that [formula] and such that [formula] are mutually orthogonal. Proceed as in the proof of Proposition [\ref=prop2] (where it suffices to have the weak ω-comparison property because the elements yj  =  〈bj〉 are full in [formula]) to obtain the desired element b.

We end this section by describing when separable C*-algebra s with finite decomposition rank are stable (under the assumption that their stabilization contains a full projection):

Let A be a separable C*-algebra with finite decomposition rank, and assume that [formula] contains a full projection. Then the following conditions are equivalent:

A is stable.

A has no non-zero unital quotients and no non-zero bounded positive traces.

A has property (S).

Let p be a full projection in [formula] and put [formula]. Then B has the same decomposition rank as A, say n; and B is unital. It follows from Proposition [\ref=lema_princ] that [formula] has weak n-comparison and therefore also the weak ω-comparison property. As A is (isomorphic to) a full hereditary sub-C*-algebra of [formula] the result now follows from Proposition [\ref=propw2]. (In (ii) we have used that any 2-quasitrace on a nuclear C*-algebra is a trace.)

The Corona Factorization Property and the Cuntz semigroup

Recall that a C*-algebra A is said to have the Corona Factorization Property if every full projection in the multiplier algebra of [formula] is properly infinite. It was observed by Kucerovsky and Ng in [\cite=KN] that the Corona Factorization Property is equivalent to a statement regarding stability of full hereditary sub-C*-algebra s of the stabilized C*-algebra. Our aim here is to characterize the Corona Factorization Property for C*-algebras in terms of the comparison property of the Cuntz semigroup of the same name introduced in Section [\ref=sec:semigroups]. We shall need several lemmas before we can arrive at the main results of this section.

Let A be a σ-unital C*-algebra and suppose that {ek} is an increasing approximate unit for A consisting of positive contractions. Then:

For every positive a in A and for every ε > 0 one has [formula] for all large enough k.

{〈ek〉} is a full sequence in [formula].

(i). We have [formula] for k large enough, whence [formula].

(ii). The sequence {〈ek〉} is clearly increasing. The fullness property of this sequence follows from (i), from the fact that [formula] is an approximate unit for Mn(A) and that [formula] is dense in [formula].

Recall from Section [\ref=sec:stable] the definition of the set F(A) of compactly supported elements in a C*-algebra A. Suppose that A is σ-unital. Then, to any strictly positive element c in A one can associate the set

[formula]

cf. [\cite=HR], where [formula] is the continous function that vanishes on

[formula]

such that [formula]. To see that the sequence {(an  -  δn)+}∞n = 1 is full in A, let I be the closed two-sided ideal generated by this sequence. Since [formula] whenever 1  ≤  j  <  n, we see that (aj - 1 / n)+ belongs to I whenever n  >  j. It follows that aj belongs to I for all j, whence I = A, because the sequence {an} was assumed to be full.)

Next we choose δ'n > 0 such that [formula] for all n. Let gn:[0,1]  →  [0,1] be the continuous function given by gn(0) = 0, gn(t) = 1 for t  ≥  δ'n, and gn is linear on
