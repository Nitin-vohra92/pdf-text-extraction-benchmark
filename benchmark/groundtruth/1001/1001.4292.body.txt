On the uniqueness of almost-Kähler structures

Introduction

Given a Riemannian four manifold (M,g) an orthogonal almost-Kähler structure is an orthogonal almost complex structure J such that g(J  ·  ,  ·  ) is a closed two form. It seems to be quite difficult to determine, in general, the obstructions on the metric g to the existence of such a structure. While integrability results are available for Einstein, anti-self-dual metrics [\cite=arm], familiar examples such as the Kodaira-Thurston manifold support (see e.g. [\cite=surv]) a full circle of almost-Kähler structures on the same orientation.

In this note we explore the uniqueness question of almost Kähler structures orthogonal with respect to a Kähler metric and compatible with the positive orientation. The proof of Theorem [\ref=main] is build around the observation that the angle function between the structures J and [formula] is isoparametric in the sense of Cartan. The conclusion follows by investigation of the eigenvalue structure of the second fundamental form of its level sets.

In particular we obtain the following, that answers a question posed in [\cite=surv].

Both spaces are equipped with Kähler Einstein metrics of negative scalar curvature. In the case of [formula], an orthogonal almost-Kähler structure is either compatible with the negative orientation, where integrability follows from [\cite=arm] since the metric is self-dual, or with the positive orientation, where the same conclusion is obtained by Theorem [\ref=main]. For [formula] which admits a Kähler structure on either orientation it suffices to apply Theorem [\ref=main] twice.

Almost Kähler structures on Kähler surfaces

Let (M,g,J) be a Kähler surface, positively oriented by J and admitting a positive orthogonal almost-Kähler structure [formula]. Recall that the bundle Λ+M of self-dual forms on M splits as

[formula]

where λ2JM = {α∈Λ2M:α(J  ·  ,J  ·  ) =  - α}. The Kähler form [formula] of [formula] is self-dual hence

[formula]

along [\eqref=split1], where ωJ = g(J  ·  ,  ·  ) is the Kähler form of J and Ψ belongs to λ2JM.The angle map [formula] is explicitly given by [formula].

Since [formula] is a closed form in Λ+M it is in particular harmonic, thus Δx = 0 because the splitting [\eqref=split1] is parallel w.r.t the Levi-Civita connection of g and hence preserved by the Laplace operator. At this stage it is straightforward to treat the compact case.

Since M is compact, x must be constant hence Ψ either vanishes or it has constant, non-zero norm. As it is well known, the latter case forces [formula].

Let now D be the open set where Ψ is non zero, to be assumed not empty in what follows. After re-normalisation of Ψ we can write [formula] where I is a local gauge for J and x2 + y2 = 1. That is I is an orthogonal almost complex structure such that IJ + JI = 0. We obtain a local gauge [formula] for [formula] given by

[formula]

where K = IJ. Let [formula] denote the Levi-Civita connection of g.

Because J is Kähler we have [formula] for some local 1-form b on M such that db = ρJ, where [formula] is the Ricci form of (g,J). Here the Riemann curvature tensor is defined by [formula] for all X,Y in TM and Ric is the Ricci contraction.

The local connection 1-forms [formula] and [formula] of the gauge [formula] are determined from the almost Kähler condition on [formula], that is [formula], by

[formula]

The action of [formula] on 1-forms on M is defined by [formula]. Without loss of generality we write x =  cos θ,y =  sin θ for some local function θ on M.

Let us record first the following inversion formulae

[formula]

(i) We compute after using [\eqref=inv]. Therefore [formula] and [formula] from the almost Kähler condition. (ii) As in (i), we differentiate in [\eqref=gauge-new] to find after using [\eqref=inv] and x2 + y2 = 1. The claim is proved by comparison with [\eqref=lcf]. (iii) Because (g,J) is Kähler the positive Weyl tensor is given by

[formula]

with respect to the decomposition [\eqref=split1]. In particular, [formula], making that the conformal scalar curvature [formula] of [formula] is given by [formula]. The well known (see [\cite=surv]) relation [formula] combined with [\eqref=lcf] and (i) yields the claim.

In particular, Theorem [\ref=main] folllows immediately when [formula]. Therefore, we assume from now on that the metric g is Einstein, that is [formula] and re-normalise the scalar curvature to [formula]. We may assume, w.l.og. that sin θ > 0 so that |θ|  =   sin θ by Lemma [\ref=prel], (iii). The unit vector field [formula] is then totally geodesic henceforth normal to the co-dimension one Riemannian foliation induced by V  =   ker dθ.

Let S in S2V be given by [formula] for all V,W in V. It describes the second fundamental form of the distribution V. The unit vector field [formula] in V has dual one form ξ1 subject to

[formula]

since ξ1 = b by (i) in Lemma [\ref=prel].

(i) We have [formula] for an arbitrary local orthonormal frame in V since the angle function is harmonic. Since

[formula]

we have [formula], and its now easy to conclude. (ii) Because x is harmonic, we have Δ(dx) = 0 and hence [formula] by the Bochner formula. Taking the scalar product with dx we get further

[formula]

By [\eqref=comp] we have |dx|  =   sin 2θ = 1 - x2. Using again that x is harmonic we obtain [formula] thus [formula]. After expressing dx in terms of ξ, which is of unit length, we get [formula] and the claim follows. (iii) By [\eqref=str-1] we have dξ1 =  - ωJ hence [formula] for all X,Y in TM. Taking [formula] we get [formula]. Therefore

[formula]

However, by means of [\eqref=gauge-new] and the definition of [formula] we get [formula] while [\eqref=inv] yields [formula] and the claim follows.

[formula] Proof of Theorem [\ref=main]: On the orthogonal complement V0 of ξ1 in V we must have [formula] by (ii) and (iii) in Lemma [\ref=l3]. Since S is symmetric and preserves V0 it follows that cos 2θ = 0 which is contradictory to having D non-empty.
