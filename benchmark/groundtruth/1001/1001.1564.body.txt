Modified Jordan-Brans-Dicke theory with scalar current and the Eddington-Robertson γ-parameter

Jordan-Brans-Dicke [\cite=Jordan1955] [\cite=BD1962] theory is a theory of gravitation in which the gravitational constant G is replaced with the inverse of a dynamical scalar field φ. It can be demonstrated by straightforward derivation that this scalar field is effectively sourced by the curvature of space-time (see, e.g., [\cite=Weinberg1972]). There is, however, no scalar current: in the Lagrangian formulation, the variation of matter fields with respect to the scalar field is assumed to be zero.

Jordan-Brans-Dicke theory runs into severe observational constraints within the solar system. Notably, the theory predicts that the value of the post-Newtonian γ-parameter, first introduced by Eddington [\cite=Eddington] and Robertson [\cite=Robertson1938] and also Schiff [\cite=Schiff1960a], and effectively measuring the amount of spatial curvature produced by unit rest mass, will deviate from the standard general relativistic value of 1. Instead, its value will be γ = (ω + 1) / (ω + 2) [\cite=Weinberg1972], where ω is the dimensionless coupling constant of the dynamical field. Constraints established by precision measurements of the Cassini spacecraft [\cite=BT2003] require the uncomfortably large value of |ω| > 4  ×  104.

Nonetheless, there is no a priori reason to exclude the possibility of a scalar current. A phenomenological matter Lagrangian could be constructed such that it depends explicitly on G = φ- 1. The variation of such a Lagrangian with respect to φ would be non-zero, introducing a scalar current into the field equations. To demonstrate this, we write the scalar theory Lagrangian as follows:

[formula]

where R is the Ricci-scalar constructed from the metric gμν, g is the metric determinant, Λ is the cosmological constant, φ is a scalar field, f is an arbitrary function, and O.F. stands for terms that represent other fields, which, we assume, depend only on φ, not on its derivatives. We set c = 1, use the ( + , - , - , - ) metric signature, and define the Ricci tensor as Rμν  =  ∂αΓαμν  -  ∂νΓαμα  +  ΓαμνΓβαβ  -  ΓαμβΓβαν, where the Γ are the usual Christoffel-symbols.

The field equations of the theory are the Euler-Lagrange equations corresponding to ([\ref=eq:L]):

[formula]

where [formula] is the covariant derivative with respect to xμ. These equations can be recast in the form,

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula]. The existence of a non-zero variation of matter fields with respect to φ represents a significant generalization of the archetypal scalar field theory of Jordan, Brans and Dicke.

Equation ([\ref=eq:EFE]) can be rewritten using covariant derivatives, yielding

[formula]

Spelled out, the field equations now take the following form:

[formula]

where v = ∂f / ∂φ and w = ∂f / ∂(gμν∂μφ∂νφ). Taking the trace of ([\ref=eq:EFE1]), we obtain

[formula]

allowing us to rewrite ([\ref=eq:EFE1]) and ([\ref=eq:EQG1]) as

[formula]

For Jordan-Brans-Dicke theory, f(φ,gμν∂μφ∂νφ) =  - ω∂μφ∂μφ  /  φ, hence v =  - f / φ and w =  - ω  /  φ. Therefore, the equations read

[formula]

which, apart from the presence of J, are the equations of Jordan-Brans-Dicke theory in the standard form. To the first post-Newtonian order, terms quadratic in derivatives vanish; the second derivative in ([\ref=eq:EFE2]) can, in turn, be eliminated by a suitable gauge choice (for a thorough derivation, see Appendix A of [\cite=Deng2009]). In the post-Newtonian metric [\cite=Will1993], T≃T00 and the γ-parameter can be read off as the ratio of the ii and 00 components of ([\ref=eq:EFE2]). In the absence of a cosmological term, Λ = 0, we get

[formula]

If the scalar current vanishes (J = 0), we get back the usual post-Newtonian result for Jordan-Brans-Dicke theory:

[formula]

This result is frequently cited as a reason for rejecting Jordan-Brans-Dicke theory within the solar system, as precision measurements by the Cassini spacecraft yielding γ - 1 = (2.1  ±  2.3)  ×  10- 5, for instance, are consistent with the theory only if [formula] [\cite=BT2003].

However, if a scalar current is present, the situation changes. Specifically, we can choose a scalar current in the form

[formula]

which is equivalent to

[formula]

This choice can be made, in part, because J is not a conserved quantity, just as T is not conserved. In this case, equations ([\ref=eq:EFE2]) and ([\ref=eq:EQG2]) read

[formula]

Considering the trace of the bracketed term in Eq. ([\ref=eq:EFE3]), if

[formula]

the general relativistic result that is also consistent with solar system data,

[formula]

is easily satisfied.

The result ([\ref=eq:BDgamma]) has been used as an argument against theories that, within the solar system, yield the same solution as Jordan-Brans-Dicke theory to the first post-Newtonian order. We mention in particular our scalar-tensor-vector (STVG) modified gravity theory (MOG) [\cite=Moffat2006a] [\cite=Moffat2007e], which, according to an extensive analysis by Deng, et al. [\cite=Deng2009], shows the same behavior in the solar system as Jordan-Brans-Dicke theory. This problem is avoided by a suitable choice of J yielding ([\ref=eq:GRgamma]), as demonstrated above.

Nonetheless, we note that in the case of J  ≠  0, the theory is no longer a metric theory: material particles carry a scalar charge and no longer move along geodesics. To determine the equations of motion for a test particle, we use a test particle Lagrangian in the form

[formula]

where q is the scalar charge associated with a particle of mass m, moving with four-velocity uμ = dxμ / dτ and τ is the proper time along the particle's world line. Integration of ([\ref=eq:WEPcond]) over a three-volume encompassing a test particle gives

[formula]

and [formula] at the present epoch (GN is Newton's constant of gravitation.) The equation of motion obtained by varying ([\ref=eq:TPL]) contains an extra term when compared to the standard geodesic equation of motion:

[formula]

Given ([\ref=eq:q]), we obtain

[formula]

We observe that m cancels out in the equation of motion, hence the theory satisfies the weak equivalence principle.

Finally, we note that equation ([\ref=eq:EQG3]) can be rewritten in the familiar form

[formula]

with [formula] and μ given by

[formula]

This last term can be interpreted as the mass μ of the scalar field φ. Using Λ≃1.2  ×  10- 52 m- 2, we obtain the mass of an ultralight scalar field, [formula] kg.
