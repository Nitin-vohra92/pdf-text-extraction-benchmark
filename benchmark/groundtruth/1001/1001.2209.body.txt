Introduction

Let Vn be the n-dimensional vector space over the binary field [formula], i.e.,

[formula]

For [formula] and [formula], the Hamming distance [formula] between [formula] and [formula] is the number of coordinates in which they differ, i.e.,

[formula]

The Hamming weight [formula] of a vector [formula] is the number of nonzero coordinates in [formula]. Obviously,

[formula]

An n-cube (or n-dimensional hypercube) is a graph with the vertex set Vn and the edge set

[formula]

A coloring of Vn with L colors is a map Γ from the vertex set Vn to [formula]. We say that the vertex [formula] is colored with the color [formula]. A d-distance (resp. An exactly d-distance) coloring of Vn is to color the vertices of Vn such that any two vertices with Hamming distance at most d (resp. exactly d) have different colors. Note that for a coloring of Vn with L colors

[formula]

it is a d-distance coloring of Vn if and only if for any two distinct vertices [formula],

[formula]

it is an exactly d-distance coloring of Vn if and only if for any two distinct vertices [formula],

[formula]

Denote χ'd(n) (resp. χd(n)) as the minimum number of colors of a d-distance (resp. an exactly d-distance) coloring of Vn.

These two hypercube coloring problems originally arose in the study of the scalability of optical networks (see [\cite=pav]). In [\cite=eno]-[\cite=fran], [\cite=jm1]-[\cite=lmt], [\cite=ngo1]-[\cite=wan], [\cite=zhs] and [\cite=zi], some bounds on χ'd(n) and χd(n) are given and some exact values are determined.

The d-distance coloring and exactly d-distance coloring of Vn are equivalent to certain partitions of Vn, which are related to codes in coding theory. A nonempty subset C of Vn is called a binary code of length n. Any word in C is called a codeword of C. The minimum distance d(C) is defined as the minimum distance between two distinct codewords of C. A binary code C of length n and minimum distance d is called a binary (n,d) code. A binary code C of length n and minimum distance at least d is called a binary (n,  ≥  d) code. For fixed length n and minimum distance d, let A(n,d) denote the maximum size of a binary (n,d) code. A binary code C is called a binary

[formula]

linear code C. It is also well known in coding theory that the minimum distance d(C) of a linear code C is equal to the minimum Hamming weight of nonzero codewords. A binary

[formula]

linear code. For fixed length n and minimum distance d, let k(n,d) denote the maximum dimension of a binary

[formula]

2 =|V| = |B| ≤ L· Q(n,).

[formula]

linear code C, the cosets of C form an (n,2n - k,d + 1)-partition of Vn. Hence, if there exists a binary

[formula]

linear code, then by ([\ref=ab1]), χ'd(n)  =  2n - k(n,d + 1). In this way, a number of exact values of χ'd(n) are determined.

Our main results in this paper are given by the following theorems.

For any odd integer r  ≥  3, we have

[formula]

For any even number d, we have

[formula]

where ⌈x⌉ is the smallest integer not less than x.

If d is even and n  ≥  2d, then

[formula]

Theorem [\ref=theorem1] could not be obtained by using the above argument of binary linear codes. We prove Theorem [\ref=theorem1] in Section 2 by using the argument of [formula]-linear codes. In Section 3, we prove Theorems [\ref=theorem2] and [\ref=theorem3] by using the argument of linear forbidden distance codes. In order to prove Theorems [\ref=theorem2] and [\ref=theorem3], some properties of linear forbidden distance codes are given. Furthermore, we derive the following inequality on χd(n) and χ'd(n).

[formula]

Kim, Du and Pardalos [\cite=kim] showed that χd(n)  =  2 for odd d and

[formula]

It is not hard to check that Bound ([\ref=aa3]) improves on Bound ([\ref=aa4]). Note that Bound ([\ref=bou]) depends on k(n,d) and is not explicit. Tables of lower and upper bounds on k(n,d) for small n are available in [\cite=brou] and [\cite=brouw]. Using Theorem [\ref=theorem3] and presently best known lower bounds on k(n,d) listed in [\cite=brou] and [\cite=brouw], we can obtain upper bounds on χd(n) for small n, which improve on Bound ([\ref=aa3]). For example, if n = 13,d = 4, Bound ([\ref=aa3]) gives χ4(13)  ≤  28, while Bound ([\ref=bou]) gives χ4(13)  ≤  27; if n = 14,d = 4, Bound ([\ref=aa3]) gives χ4(14)  ≤  29, while Bound ([\ref=bou]) gives χ4(13)  ≤  27; if n = 28,d = 6, Bound ([\ref=aa3]) gives χ6(28)  ≤  217, while Bound ([\ref=bou]) gives χ6(28)  ≤  211.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem1]

In this section, we prove Theorem [\ref=theorem1] by using the argument of [formula]-linear codes. Actually, Ngo et al. [\cite=ngo2] observed that [formula]-linear codes may be used to study this hypercube coloring problem. Unfortunately, they [\cite=ngo2] said that the construction of [formula]-linear codes is quite involved, and gave no results in this direction.

In order to establish our results, we first review some basic definitions, notations and results for [formula]-linear codes. A detailed treatment of [formula]-linear codes can be found in [\cite=hamm] and [\cite=wanz].

Let [formula] be the ring of integers modulo 4, and let [formula] be the set of n-tuples over [formula]. A nonempty subset C of [formula] is called a [formula]-code. An additive subgroup C of [formula] is called a [formula]-linear code. Any [formula]-linear code is permutation equivalent to a [formula]-linear code with a generator matrix of the form

[formula]

where A and C are matrices with entries from {0,1} and B is a [formula]-matrix. Then C is called a [formula]-linear code of type 4k12k2, and the size of C is |C| = 4k12k2.

The Lee weights of [formula] are defined by

[formula]

The Lee weight [formula] of [formula] is defined to be the rational sum of the Lee weights of its components, i.e.,

[formula]

The Lee distance [formula] between two tuples [formula] is defined by

[formula]

For a [formula]-code C, the minimum Lee distance dL(C) of C is defined as the minimum Lee distance between two distinct codewords of C. It is well known that for a [formula]-linear code C, the minimum Lee distance dL(C) is equal to the minimum Lee weight wL(C) of the nonzero codewords of C.

The Gray map φ is a map from [formula] to [formula] defined as follows:

[formula]

Clearly, φ is a bijection from [formula] to [formula]. The Gray map φ can be extended in an obvious way to a map from [formula] to [formula] as follows:

[formula]

Note that we still use φ to denote this extended map. It is easy to see that φ is still a bijection from [formula] to [formula]. The following result about the Gray map can be found in [\cite=hamm] and [\cite=wanz].

The Gray map φ is a distance-preserving map from [formula] to [formula], i.e., [formula] for all [formula], and φ is also a weight-preserving map from [formula] to [formula], i.e., [formula] for all [formula].

Let C be a [formula]-code of length n. The binary image of C is defined as

[formula]

Clearly, C is a binary code of length 2n and size |C| = |C|. It follows from Lemma [\ref=lemma1] that the minimum Hamming distance of C is equal to the minimum Lee distance of C, i.e., d(C)  =  dL(C). Note that the binary image of a [formula]-linear code may not be a binary linear code. Some well-known nonlinear binary codes such as the Nordstrom-Robinson, Kerdock, Preparata, Goethals, and Delsarte-Goethals codes contain more codewords than any known binary linear codes with the same length and minimum distance. For example, the Preparata code contains twice as many codewords as the extended 2-error-correcting BCH code of the same length. Hammons et al. [\cite=hamm] showed that these codes can be very simply constructed as the binary image of certain [formula]-linear codes under the Gray map.

In the following we use [formula]-linear codes to construct (n,L,d)-partitions of Vn.

If there exists a [formula]-linear code of length n, type 4k12k2 and minimum Lee distance dL  ≥  3, then there exist a (2n,22n - 2k1 - k2,dL)-partition of V2n and a (2n - 1,22n - 1 - 2k1 - k2,dL - 1)-partition of V2n - 1.

Let C be a [formula]-linear code of length n, type 4k12k2 and minimum Lee distance dL  ≥  3. Recall that the size |C| = 4k12k2 and dL is equal to the minimum Lee weight of C. Note that C is an additive subgroup of [formula]. The number of cosets of C is given by

[formula]

Denote these cosets as

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula]. Note that every Bi is a [formula]-code of length n, size 4k12k2 and minimum Lee distance dL. Furthermore, {Bi}Ni = 1 forms a partition of [formula]. Denote the binary image of Bi under the Gray map φ as

[formula]

Recall that φ is a bijection from [formula] to [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lemma1], we know that Bi is a binary code of length 2n, size 4k12k2 and minimum Hamming distance dL. Furthermore, {Bi}Ni = 1 forms a partition of [formula]. Hence, {Bi}Ni = 1 forms a (2n,N,dL)-partition of V2n.

Next, we further construct a (2n - 1,N / 2,dL - 1)-partition of V2n - 1. Consider the cosets of C with respect to the additive group [formula], i.e., [formula]. We say that two cosets Bi and Bj are equivalent if there exists [formula] such that

[formula]

Hence, the equivalence class containing the coset Bi is given as

[formula]

The four cosets in the equivalence class [formula] are distinct since dL  ≥  3. Let N1 = N / 4. Note that there are N1 equivalence classes in total, and these N1 equivalence classes form a partition of the coset set [formula]. Denote these N1 equivalence classes as

[formula]

Next we consider the binary images of four cosets in an equivalence class. Hammons et al. [\cite=hamm] observed that for [formula] and [formula]

[formula]

where α is a map from [formula] to [formula] defined by

[formula]

[formula] is defined as [formula] and [formula] is defined as

[formula]

If [formula], then

[formula]

and

[formula]

Hence, if α(xn) = 0,

[formula]

if α(xn) = 1,

[formula]

If [formula], then

[formula]

and

[formula]

Hence,

[formula]

If [formula], then

[formula]

and

[formula]

Hence, if α(xn) = 0,

[formula]

if α(xn) = 1,

[formula]

Therefore, for the four cosets in an equivalence class [formula], the binary images are given by

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

For a nonempty subset B of V2n, denote by B* the set obtained by deleting the last coordinate of each word in B. Since Bi, Bi,1, Bi,2, Bi,3 are binary codes of length 2n, size 4k12k2 and minimum Hamming distance dL, then B*i, B*i,1, B*i,2, B*i,3 are binary codes of length 2n - 1, size 4k12k2 and minimum Hamming distance at least dL - 1. Furthermore, by the expressions of Bi, Bi,1, Bi,2, Bi,3, we have

[formula]

Applying the above procedure to every equivalence class of

[formula]

we know that

[formula]

Since

[formula]

then

[formula]

form a (2n - 1,N / 2,dL - 1)-partition of V2n - 1.

Now we prove Theorem [\ref=theorem1] by using Theorem [\ref=theorem4].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem1]: For odd r  ≥  3, Hammons et al. [\cite=hamm] constructed a [formula]-linear code P(r) of length 2r, type 42r - r - 1 and minimum Lee distance 6. The binary image [formula] is a nonlinear binary code of length 2r + 1, size 22r + 1 - 2r - 2 and minimum Hamming distance 6. This binary code is also called the Preparata code in [\cite=hamm]. By Theorem [\ref=theorem4], there exist a (2r + 1,22r + 2,6)-partition of V2r + 1 and a (2r + 1 - 1,22r + 1,5)-partition of V2r + 1 - 1 for odd r  ≥  3. Since a d-distance coloring of Vn with L colors is equivalent to an (n,L,d + 1)-partition of Vn, we have for odd r  ≥  3,

[formula]

Furthermore, the Preparata code is an optimal binary code, i.e., A(2r + 1,6) = 22r + 1 - 2r - 2 for odd r  ≥  3. It follows from ([\ref=ab1]) that

[formula]

Since A(n,d) = A(n + 1,d + 1) for odd d (see [\cite=ms]), we have A(2r + 1 - 1,5) = A(2r + 1,6) = 22r + 1 - 2r - 2 for odd r  ≥  3. Using ([\ref=ab1]) again, we obtain

[formula]

Theorem [\ref=theorem1] follows from combining ([\ref=bb1]) with ([\ref=bb2]) and ([\ref=bb3]). [formula]

By generalizing the above argument, if there exists a [formula]-linear code of length n, type 4k12k2 and minimum Lee distance dL  ≥  2t + 1, we can construct a (2n - t,N / 2t,dL - t)-partition of V2n - t. The proof of this fact is more tedious and omitted here. In this way, we can construct a (dL - t - 1)-distance coloring of V2n - t with N / 2t colors. In some cases, this method yields good distance colorings of hypercubes with less colors.

Proofs of Theorems [\ref=theorem2] and [\ref=theorem3] and Proposition [\ref=prop]

In this section, we prove Theorems [\ref=theorem2] and [\ref=theorem3] and Proposition [\ref=prop] by using the argument of linear forbidden distance codes. Some properties of linear forbidden distance codes are given.

A binary

[formula]

linear forbidden distance code if C is also an [formula] forbidden distance code, that is, [formula] for any nonzero codeword of C. Given n and d, denote by [formula] the maximum dimension of a binary

[formula]

linear forbidden distance code C, the cosets of C form an [formula]-partition of Vn. Recall that an exactly d-distance coloring of Vn with L colors is equivalent to an [formula]-partition of Vn. Hence, we have the following results.

If there exists a binary

[formula]

Below we derive some bounds on [formula]. Using these bounds and Lemma [\ref=lemma3], we prove Theorems [\ref=theorem2] and [\ref=theorem3]. For a binary matrix H of size m  ×  n, we can define a linear code

[formula]

The dimension of C, dim(C) = n - r(H)  ≥  n - m, where r(H) is the rank of H. It is not hard to see that C is a binary [formula] forbidden distance code if and only if the sum of any d columns of H is not the zero vector, i.e., any column of H is not equal to the sum of any other d - 1 columns of H. Similar to the Varshamov-Gilbert bound (see [\cite=ms]) for linear codes in coding theory, we have the following lower bound on [formula].

[formula]

where ⌈y⌉ is the smallest integer greater than or equal to y.

We shall show that if

[formula]

then there exists a binary matrix H of size m  ×  n such that any column of H is not equal to the sum of any other d - 1 columns of H. We choose the first column [formula], [formula], the n-th column [formula] of H from Vm step by step. In general, we can choose [formula] to be any vector of Vm, and choose [formula] to be any vector of Vm that is not the sum of any d - 1 distinct vectors of [formula], [formula], [formula]. Now, there are at most [formula] such sum vectors. It follows from ([\ref=ca5]) that for [formula],

[formula]

Hence, in this way we can choose the first column [formula], [formula], the n-th column [formula] of H. The binary linear code C defined by ([\ref=ca3]) is a binary

[formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem2]: Theorem [\ref=theorem2] follows from ([\ref=ca2]) and ([\ref=ca4]). [formula]

We see from Lemma [\ref=lemma3] that [formula] can be used to give an upper bound on χd(n). We next give some properties of [formula]. Using these properties we prove Theorem [\ref=theorem3].

[formula]

It follows from Lemma [\ref=lemma4] that

[formula]

On the other hand, let C be a binary

[formula]

[formula]

In particular,

[formula]

Let C1 be a binary

[formula]

linear forbidden distance code. Denote

[formula]

It is easy to check that C is a binary

[formula]

It follows from ([\ref=kk3]) that [formula] for even d. Enomoto et al. [\cite=eno] proved that [formula] for even d. This shows that Bound ([\ref=kk3]) is tight for some cases.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem3]: It follows from ([\ref=kk3]) that, if d is even and n  ≥  2d,

[formula]

Theorem [\ref=theorem3] follows from ([\ref=ca2]) and ([\ref=kk4]). [formula]

Now we prove Proposition [\ref=prop] by using the following lemma.

If there exist an (n1,L1,d + 1)-partition of Vn1 and an [formula]-partition of Vn2, then there exists an [formula]-partition of Vn1 + n2.

Suppose that the L1 subsets {Bi}L1i = 1 of Vn1 form an (n1,L1,d + 1)-partition of Vn1, and the L2 subsets {Ej}L2j = 1 of Vn2 form an [formula]-partition of Vn2. Then, by the definitions of an (n1,L1,d + 1)-partition of Vn1 and an [formula]-partition of Vn2, Bi is a binary (n1,  ≥  (d + 1)) code and Ej is a binary [formula] forbidden distance code. It is easy to see that

[formula]

is an [formula] forbidden distance code. Hence, the L1L2 subsets Bi  ×  Ej, 1  ≤  i  ≤  L1, 1  ≤  j  ≤  L2, of Vn1 + n2 form an [formula]-partition of Vn1 + n2.

Proof of Proposition [\ref=prop]: Note that a d-distance coloring of Vn with L colors is equivalent to an (n,L,d + 1)-partition of Vn, and an exactly d-distance coloring of Vn with L colors is equivalent to an [formula]-partition of Vn. Lemma [\ref=lemma5] tells us that for a d-distance coloring of Vn1 with L1  =  χ'd(n1) colors and an exactly d-distance coloring of Vn2 with L2  =  χd(n2) colors, we can construct an exactly d-distance coloring of Vn1 + n2 with L1L2 colors. Hence, we have

[formula]
