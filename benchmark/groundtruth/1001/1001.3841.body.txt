SEARCH FOR A POSSIBLE SPONTANEOUS EMISSION OF MUONS FROM HEAVY NUCLEI

Introduction

In the late 80's, some theoretical work was dedicated to investigate possible exotic types of nuclear radioactivity, consisting in the emission of light particles such as pions or muons from heavy nuclei [\cite=ion1] [\cite=ion2].

Muons or pions could be emitted by nuclei through the decays[\cite=ion2]:

where, for reasons of energy and momentum conservation, the number of fragments n is ≥  2. The nuclei (A1,Z1), ~ (A2,Z2),...,(An,Zn) would yield a sequence of β- decays leading finally to stable nuclei with a balanced neutron-proton ratio.

In ref. 2 some nuclear charge thresholds for different possible spontaneous particle emission were listed:

(i) ~ μ± (prompt muon) for Z  ≥  72

(ii) ~ π± (prompt pion →   delayed muon) for Z  ≥  76

(iii) ~ 2μ± (prompt muon pairs) for Z  ≥  91

(iv) ~ 2π± (prompt pion pairs →   delayed muon pairs) for Z  ≥  100

Natural lead is mainly composed by three nuclides: 206Pb (24.1%), 207Pb (22.1%) and 208Pb (52.4%). They are stable nuclides, but the channels (i) and (ii) are energetically allowed.

In the hypothesis of the decays ([\ref=eq:1]) and ([\ref=eq:2]), the fission fragments would remain nearly at rest; most of the available energy would be used to produce the μ (or π) and the kinetic energies of μ and νμ (or π). The total kinetic energy Qμ in a decay in 2 fragments with close values of A1 and A2 (symmetric fission) is ~  30 MeV for negative muons and ~  20 MeV for positive muons. Considering that the associated muon neutrino takes away a sizable fraction of this energy, the spectrum of emitted muons could be like in a β decay, with an average energy of 10  ÷  15 MeV.

The spontaneous or neutron induced fission of Pb has never been observed. A search for a Pb muonic decay can be made as a byproduct of the OPERA experiment[\cite=opera], aimed to confirm neutrino oscillations in the parameter region indicated by some atmospheric neutrino experiments [\cite=soudan]-[\cite=superk]. In the following, we discuss the experimental set-up, a Monte Carlo (MC) simulation and the reachable limits.

Experimental set-up

We propose to perform an experimental search for muonic radioactivity from lead nuclei in the low background conditions offered by the Gran Sasso underground Laboratory (LNGS). The low cosmic muon flux and the low natural radioactivity of the rock in the experimental halls of the LNGS provide unique conditions, allowing a potential discovery, or, at least, to establish a good upper limit for this exotic decay process. A detailed description of the different background sources is given in ref. 7.

The OPERA base element ("brick") is composed of 56 lead sheets (1 mm thick) interleaved with 2 nuclear emulsion sheets (43 μm thick) on both sides of a 200 μm thick plastic base. The area of each sheet is 10.3  ×  12.8 cm2. The OPERA bricks (each containing a mass of 8.23 kg of Pb) could allow an experimental search for muon emission from lead, with exposures of several months. Their analyses with the fast automated optical microscopes[\cite=microscopi] would establish the local background contributions and validate the analysis procedures.

As the background rejection/reduction (see ref. 7) is a crucial point for this search, the detectors are surrounded on all sides by a shield, making a closed box structure. The shield is composed of an inner layer 5 cm thick of very pure copper followed by 15 cm of very low activity lead. The third layer of the shield is a 3 cm thick polyethylene, in order to absorb neutrons. The set-up is located in the emulsion storage room, in hall B of the Gran Sasso Laboratory. The radon reduction is obtained with a ventilation system with fresh air forced circulation.

Monte Carlo simulation

A MC simulation program was implemented to estimate the occurrence of different event topologies. The simulation is based on the GEANT [\cite=geant] package applied to the OPERA lead/emulsion set-up. The simulation reproduces one complete OPERA brick, where muons of different energies (see the first column of Table [\ref=tab:mu]) originate in random positions in the lead sheets. The initial muon directions are isotropically generated. We assumed different definitions for a candidate event, requiring that the muon crosses at least: (i) 2 emulsion films, (ii) 4 emulsion film (and thus also a lead plate) and (iii) 6 emulsion films (and thus also 2 lead plates). We also requested the detection of the decay positron or electron in at least (iv) 2, (v) 4 or (vi) 6 emulsion layers, together with the muon detection.

For each topology, the values quoted in Table [\ref=tab:mu] were obtained as averages over all possible muon emission directions. These estimates may be considered as geometrical efficiencies εg. The percentages of events listed in Table [\ref=tab:mu] were computed for samples of 1500 MC events with fixed energies.

In Fig. [\ref=fig:mu] are shown two simulated muon emission events from the lead inside an OPERA brick, assuming an initial kinetic energy of 15 MeV, and the production of a μ+ (left) and a μ- (right).

Estimates of global detection efficiencies

The geometrical εg have to be multiplied by the μ± and e± reconstruction efficiencies to obtain the total efficiency. With the OPERA tracking procedure [\cite=saverio], the mean detection efficiency for each "microtrack" in one emulsion film is ≃95%. The instrumental limit of 0.8 rad on the incident direction introduces an event selection of ~  30%. The "base track" (obtained from 2 microtracks separated by the plastic base) reconstruction efficiency is ≃90% ~ (95%  ×  95%). The top-bottom linking efficiency, mainly due to the multiple scattering in the plastic base, ranges from the ~  50% for 5 MeV particles to ~  99% for particles with energies ≥  20 MeV. The base track linking efficiency is ~  6% for the whole range of initial muon energies.

The detection efficiency εtot for a muon crossing at least n emulsion films is the product of the percentage of events with these topological requirements εg (col. 6 of Table [\ref=tab:mu]), the 30% given by the angular limit, n times the 95% efficiency for the microtracks, n / 2 the top-bottom linking efficiency and the linking efficiency between the base tracks. Table [\ref=tab:eff] shows the % efficiencies εg and εtot computed requiring at least 2 emulsion films crossed by the muon (col. 2-3) and 4 emulsion films crossed by the muon (col. 4-5). The values refer to the present OPERA tracking [\cite=saverio].

As the expected halflifes t1 / 2 are much larger than any reasonable exposure time T, the expected sensitivities are estimated from

[formula]

where δN  =  2.3 is the number of events corresponding to a 90% C.L. limit assuming no candidates, N0 is the initial number of nuclei, and εtot is the experimental efficiency. Using one OPERA brick for one year exposure and a global detection efficiency of ~  10%, a sensitivity of ~  7  ·  1023 yr (90% C.L.) could be reached.

Conclusions and perspectives

A test search for spontaneous emission of muons from Pb nuclei, using some OPERA lead/emulsion bricks, was described. We are in the process of making a complete simulation of the detector including its response and the track reconstruction efficiencies. We have shown that stringent limits for spontaneous muon radioactivity may be reached: t1 / 2  ≥  7  ·  1023 years.
