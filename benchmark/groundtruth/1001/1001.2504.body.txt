Presentation for parabolic subgroups of [formula].

Introduction

Let G be a finite group and [formula] be the set of generators of G. The set X is called a local generating system of depth k, if

[formula]

Local generating systems play important role in representation theory (see [\cite=okunkov]) and in classification of finite simple groups (see [\cite=phan]).

A big class of locally presented groups is provided by Coxeter systems (see [\cite=tits]). We define two-dimensional Coxeter systems as generalizations of the usual Coxeter systems. For a set X we denote by [formula] the set of k-subsets of X. A two-dimensional Coxeter system is a triple (X,f,g), where [formula] and [formula] are arbitrary functions. We will consider f as a function on X2 invariant under swapping the arguments and g as a function on X3 invariant under the action of Σ3. To every two-dimensional Coxeter system (X,f,g) we associate a finitely presented group [formula] with the set of generators X and defining relations

[formula]

Observe that the relations x21 = x22 = x23 = 3 and (x1x2x3)k = e imply that (xσ(1)xσ(2)xσ(3))k = e for any σ∈Σ3, and therefore there is no ambiguity in the description of [formula].

Recall that a stabilizer of any flag [formula] in [formula] is called a parabolic subgroup of [formula]. The main result of the paper is that every parabolic subgroup of [formula] has a presentation described by a two-dimensional Coxeter system, moreover, this presentation is local of depth 3. In fact, we shall prove this result for a large class of subgroups of [formula], which includes among others parabolic subgroups. It should be noted that in the case of the trivial flag [formula] we will recover the well-known Steinberg-Curtis presentation of [formula]. In the case of a maximal flag the corresponding parabolic group is isomorphic to the group of unipotent matrices over [formula] and our presentation coincides with the one obtained in [\cite=biss].

During the preparation of the paper the computations were performed with computer algebra system Magma[\cite=magma].

Two-dimensional Coxeter systems

Every Coxeter system (X,S) corresponds to a complete graph with integer labels on edges, which is called a Coxeter diagram. The vertices of the Coxeter diagram are the elements of X and the label of the edge (xy) is f(x,y). Similarly, we associate to every two-dimensional Coxeter system (X,f,g) a complete two-dimensional simplicial complex C(X,f,g) with labeled edges and facets. We shall refer to C(X,f,g) as a Coxeter diagram of (X,f,g). The vertices of C(X,f,g) are the elements of X, the edge (xy) will have the label f(x,y) and the facet (xyz) will have the label g(x,y,z).

To make these diagrams human comprehensible we shall use the following conventions: [formula] or [formula]     stands for     [formula]     [formula]   [formula]   [formula]   [formula]   [formula]   [formula]   [formula] stands for [formula].

For every n, we define a two-dimensional Coxeter system A2,n with the set [formula]. The function f is defined as follows

[formula]

[formula]

and f(z,t) is 2 for all other pairs of elements in X. The function g is given by

[formula]

[formula]

and g(z,t,v) = 0 for any other triple of elements in X. The corresponding diagrams for small values of n have the form:

[formula]

For a subset S of X, we denote by A2,n(S) the two-dimensional Coxeter system obtained from A2,n by restriction of f and g on S. We will identify the groups A2,n(S) with certain subgroups of [formula].

Parabolic subgroups and their intersections

Let λ be a decomposition of n. We denote by Pλ the standard parabolic subgroup of [formula] corresponding to λ. The group Pλ has the form:

[formula]

where l is the length of λ. We denote by Pλ|μ the intersection [formula]. Observe that Pλ|λ is the standard Levi subgroup of [formula] corresponding to λ. Note that these subgroups (over an arbitrary field) have appeared in the PhD thesis [\cite=woodcock] of D. Woodcock. The groups Pλ|μ are the main subject of this paper.

Let us describe recursive formulas for the orders of the groups Pλ|μ. We shall always assume that λ has l non-zero parts, and μ has m non-zero parts.

Suppose that μm  ≤  λl. Then

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula].

Every element of Pλ|μ can be written as a block matrix

[formula]

where [formula], [formula] and [formula]. Moreover, only the last λl  -  μm columns of C are non-zero. On the other hand, for any given [formula], [formula], [formula] such that only the last λl  -  μm columns of C are non-zero, the matrix

[formula]

is invertible and thus an element of Pλ|μ. Therefore there is a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of Pλ|μ and the elements of the Cartesian product

[formula]

Suppose μm  ≥  2. We shall denote by μ' the decomposition

[formula]

of n.

Suppose 1 < μm  <  λl. Then [formula].

Applying Proposition [\ref=order] two times we get

[formula]

Applying Proposition [\ref=order] one more time and using well-known formulas for the orders of general linear groups we obtain

[formula]

Suppose λl = 1. Then the index of Pλ|μ' in Pλ,μ is 2μm - 1.

Since λl = 1  ≤  μm we can apply Proposition [\ref=order] with the roles of λ and μ swapped. We get

[formula]

Generators and relations

For every decomposition [formula] of n + 1 we define the subset of stopovers

[formula]

As it is always assumed that [formula] we have [formula]. Now for every pair (λ,μ) of decompositions of n + 1 we define a subset Sλ|μ of [formula] by

[formula]

Let λ and μ be decompositions of n + 1. The groups Pλ|μ and [formula] are isomorhic.

The rest of this section is devoted to proving Theorem [\ref=main]. The strategy of the proof is the usual one: for every λ and μ we define a homomorphism

[formula]

then we show that φλ,μ is surjective and deduce from the comparison of orders that φλ,μ are isomorphisms.

Define [formula] by

[formula]

where Ei,j denotes the elementary matrix with 1 at i-th row and j-th column.

The map φ can be extended to a homomorphism of groups [formula].

We have to check that all relations imposed by the two-dimensional Coxeter system A2,n on the generators of [formula] hold for the elements φ(xj), φ(yj) of [formula]. First, we observe that if |j - k|  ≥  2 then φ(xj) and φ(yj) commute with φ(xk) and φ(yk), as required. Now all other non-trivial relations involve only the elements xj, xj + 1, xj + 2, yj, yj + 1, yj + 2 for some j. It is clear from the structure of the matrices φ(xj), φ(yj) that it is enough to check validity of the relations only for the matrices φ(x1), φ(x2), φ(x3), φ(y1), φ(y2), φ(y3). This can be done either by direct hand computation or with the help of any computer system, for example, Magma.

Before we proceed, let us remark that if a subgroup H of [formula] contains In + 1  +  Ei,j and In + 1  +  Ej,k with i < j < k (or i > j > k), then I + Ei,k∈H. In fact,

[formula]

Therefore if [formula] then [formula] and if [formula] then [formula]. We define φλ,μ to be the restriction of φ on [formula].

The image of φλ,μ coincides with Pλ|μ.

First we show that φ(Sλ|μ) is a subset of Pλ|μ. This will imply that the image of φλ,μ is a subgroup of Pλ|μ. Recall that [formula]. Since Ptμ contains all lower-triangular matrices and φ(xj) are lower-triangular it follows that φ(xj)∈Ptμ for all j. Taking into account the symmetry between x's and y's and between λ and μ it is enough to show that φ(xj) is an element of Pλ for all xj∈Sλ|μ. From the picture

[formula]

it follows immediately that φ(xj)∈Pλ if and only if [formula], which is equivalent to xj∈Sλ|μ.

To prove that φλ,μ is surjective on Pλ|μ we proceed by induction on n. For n = 0 there is nothing to prove. Suppose n  ≥  1. Without loss of generality we can assume that μm  ≤  λl. Then every element of Pλ|μ can be written as a block matrix

[formula]

where [formula], [formula], [formula], and C is such that only the last λl  -  μm columns of C are non-zero. By the remark above the matrix [formula] can be written as a product of matrices φ(xj) and φ(yj) with [formula], and therefore [formula] lies in the image of φλ,μ. Thus it is enough to show that for [formula] and [formula] the matrix

[formula]

lies in the image of φλ,μ if only the first n + 1 - λl columns of C are zero. Multiplying the matrix above by φ(xj), [formula], from the right hand side, we can annihilate all elements of C. Therefore, it remains to show that

[formula]

lies in the image of φλ,μ. This follows from the induction hypothesis.

To show that the order of the group [formula] does not exceed the order of Pλ|μ we proceed as follows. We know from Corollary [\ref=order1] and Corollary [\ref=order2] that

[formula]

where [formula]. Moreover, it is clear that

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula]. Taking into account that [formula] these relations provide enough information to compute the order of Pλ|μ for any given pair of decompositions λ and μ.

Now it is clear that the groups [formula] and [formula] are isomorphic, and that for λl  =  μm = 1 the groups [formula] and [formula] are isomorphic as well. To get the required inequality for the orders it now suffices to show that

[formula]

To prove these relations we shall give a description of coset representatives of [formula] in [formula] for 1 < μm  ≤  λl and of [formula] in [formula] for λl = 1.

Suppose 1 < μm  ≤  λl. Denote the group [formula] by H. Then the cosets of H in [formula] are given by the set

[formula]

Note that the number of elements in this set is less then or equal to

[formula]

It suffices to show that the given set of cosets is closed under the action of generators z∈S(λ,μ). Suppose j  ≤  k - 2, then

[formula]

since xj, yj commute with xs and ys as soon as |j - s|  ≥  2. If yk - 1∈S(λ|μ) then [formula] is the coset of the allowed form.

Suppose k  ≤  n and k  ≤  j  ≤  n. Then if εj = 0 we have

[formula]

If εj = 1 then we get

[formula]

Now we consider the action of xk - 1 on [formula]. We prove by induction on k starting with k = n that

[formula]

For k = n we have

[formula]

Suppose k  ≤  n - 1 and εk = 0. Then, since xk - 1 commutes with all ys, s  ≥  k and all xs, s  ≥  k + 1 we get

[formula]

Suppose that εk = 1. Then we get

[formula]

Now by the induction hypothesis we have

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

and we can use the computation for the action of yk on [formula].

If j = k then we get

[formula]

and this is a coset of allowed form. Suppose now that k + 1  ≤  j  ≤  n. If εj - 1 = 0 then we get

[formula]

which is also a coset of allowed form. Now assume that εj - 1 = 1. Then we have

[formula]

From the previous computation we already know that

[formula]

Therefore by switching xj and yj - 1 we get

[formula]

Using the relation yj - 1xj - 1yj - 1  =  xj - 1yj - 1xj - 1 we finally get

[formula]

This completes the proof of the proposition.

Suppose λl = 1. Denote the group [formula] by H. Then the cosets of H in [formula] are given by the set

[formula]

Note that the number of elements in this set is less then 2μm - 1.

It is enough to show that the given set of cosets is closed under the action of generators z∈S(λ,μ). We denote the products [formula] by wm,k. Let us fix a sequence [formula] and denote the product [formula] by v. We start by computing Hwn,kv  ·  xi. If i < k then vxi = xiv and wn,kxi = xiwn,k. Therefore Hwn,kvxi  =  Hwn,kv.

Suppose i  ≥  k and [formula]. Then vxi = xiv. We claim that Hwn,kxi = Hwn,kyi + 1. Then we will get that yi + 1v is of allowed form since yi does not occur in v and therefore yi + 1 can be brought in the suitable place.

To show that Hwn,kxi = Hwn,kyi + 1 we write wn,k as a product wn,iwi - 1,k. Since wi - 1,kxi = xiwi - 1,k and yi + 1wi - 1,k  =  wi - 1,kyi + 1 it is enough to show that Hwn,ixi  =  Hwn,iyi + 1. Note that i < n as λl = 1 and therefore [formula]. Now we have

[formula]

Since xi and yi commute with wn,i + 2, and xi commutes with yi + 1 we get

[formula]

as claimed.

Now consider the case i = jt for some 1  ≤  t  ≤  s. Let i  ≥  m  ≥  k be such that [formula] but [formula]. Then we can write v as a product v'(wm,i)- 1v''. We denote (wm,i)- 1 by [formula]. Note that v' commutes with [formula]. Therefore we get

[formula]

We claim that [formula]. This will imply that Hwn,kv  ·  xi  =  Hwn,kv.

First we consider the case i = m. In this case n  ≥  m + 1 since [formula]. We have

[formula]

Now suppose that i > m. Then we have [formula], where [formula] if i = m + 1. Therefore

[formula]

Now we consider the action of y's on the given set of cosets. Suppose i  ≤  k - 2 then yi commutes with both wn,k and v, and therefore Hwn,kv  ·  yi  =  Hwn,kv. Note that yk - 1 commutes with v as neither yk nor yk - 2 occur in v. Therefore Hwn,kv  ·  yk - 1  =  Hwn,kyk - 1v  =  Hwn,k - 1v.

Suppose now that k  ≤  i  ≤  n. If i + 1 is not an element of [formula] then we can bring yi inside v to the appropriate place and there is nothing to prove. If i + 1 = jt for some t we consider two cases: i = jt - 1 and [formula].

If [formula] we can write v as a product v'yi + 1v'', where v' commutes with yi + 1 and yi, and where v'' commutes with yi. Therefore

[formula]

Now we have wn,k  =  wn,i - 1wi - 2,k and yi + 1yi commutes with wi - 2,k. We claim that

[formula]

Then by backward substitution we will get that Hwn,kv  ·  yi  =  Hwn,kv in this case. We have

[formula]

Assume now that jt - 1 = i. We can write v as a product v'yiyi + 1v'', where v'' commutes with yi. Then Hwn,kvyi  =  Hwn,kv'yiyi + 1yiv''. Now replace yiyi + 1yi by yi + 1yiyi + 1yiyi + 1. As v' commutes with yi + 1yi and since Hwn,kyi + 1yi  =  Hwn,kyi + 1 we get

[formula]
