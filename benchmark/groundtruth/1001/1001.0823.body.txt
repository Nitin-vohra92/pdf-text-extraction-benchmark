Connectivity of complexes of separating curves

{In memory of Fritz Grünewald (1949-2010)

Statements of the results

Let S be a connected oriented surface of genus g with finite first Betti number 2g + n (i.e., a closed surface with n punctures) and make the customary assumption that S has negative Euler characteristic: if g = 0, then n  ≥  3 and if g = 1, then n  ≥  1. We recall that the curve complex C(S) of S is the simplicial complex whose vertex set consists of the isotopy classes of embedded (unoriented) circles in S which do not bound in S a disk or a cylinder. A finite set of vertices spans a simplex precisely when its elements can be represented by embedded circles that are pairwise disjoint. Thus, a closed 1-dimensional submanifold A of S with k + 1 connected components such that every connected component of its complement has negative Euler characteristic defines a k-simplex σA of C(S) and every simplex of C(S) is thus obtained.

This complex has proven to be quite useful in the study of the mapping class group of S. For the purposes of studying the Torelli group of S a subcomplex [formula] of C(S) can render a similar service. It is defined as the full subcomplex of C(S) spanned by the separating vertices of C(S), where a vertex is called separating if a representative embedded circle separates S into two components. Our main result for the case when S is closed is:

If n  ≤  1, then the simplicial complex [formula] is (g - 3)-connected.

Previous work on this topic that we are aware of concerns the case n = 0. Farb and Ivanov announced in 2005 [\cite=fi] that [formula] is connected for g  ≥  3. Putman gave in [\cite=putman:cn] another proof of this and showed that [formula] is simply connected for g  ≥  4 (op. cit., Thm. 1.11). In that paper he also mentions that Hatcher and Vogtmann have proved that [formula] is [formula]-connected for all g (unpublished).

Presumably the connectivity bound in Theorem [\ref=thm:Ag] is the best possible for every positive genus. In a paper with Van der Kallen [\cite=kl] we showed that the quotient of [formula] by the action of the Torelli group of S has the homotopy type of a bouquet of (g - 2)-spheres.

Before we state a version for the case n  ≥  2, we point out a consequence that pertains to the moduli space of curves. Consider the Teichmüller space T(S) of S on which acts the mapping class group Γ(S), so that the orbit space may be identified with the moduli space Mg of curves of that genus. The Harvey bordification of T(S), here denoted by T(S)+  ⊃  T(S), is a (noncompact) manifold with boundary with corners to which the action of Γ(S) naturally extends. This action is proper and the orbit space [formula] is a compactification of Mg that can also be obtained from the Deligne-Mumford compactification [formula] as a 'real oriented blowup' of its boundary [formula]. The walls of T(S)+ define a closed covering of the boundary ∂T(S)+ and any nonempty corner closure is an intersection of walls. As is well-known, the curve complex C(S) can be identified with the nerve of this covering of ∂T(S)+. Since the corner closures are contractible, Weil's nerve theorem implies that ∂T(S)+ has the same homotopy type as C(S).

Let Δg,0  ⊂  Δg denote the irreducible component of the Deligne-Mumford boundary whose generic point parameterizes irreducible curves with one singular point. We may understand [formula] as the moduli space of stable genus g curves with compact Jacobian and Δcg: = Δg  -  Δg,0 as the locus in Mcg that parameterizes the singular ones among them.

Let cg  →  Mcg be a (not necessarily finite) cover defined by a torsion free subgroup Γ  ⊂  Γ(S) (this means every Dehn twist along a separating curve in S has a positive power lying in Γ) and denote by cg  ⊂  cg the preimage of Δcg. Then the pair (cg,cg) is (g - 2)-connected, and [formula] for k  ≤  g - 2.

Let [formula] be obtained from T(S)+ by removing the walls that correspond to the nonseparating vertices of C(S). Then [formula] is the preimage of Mcg in T(S)+. The same reasoning as above shows that [formula] is homotopy equivalent to [formula] and so [formula] is (g - 3)-connected. It follows that we can construct a relative CW complex [formula] obtained from [formula] by attaching cells of dimension ≥  g - 1 in a Γ(S)-equivariant manner as to ensure that Z is contractible and no nontrivial element of Γ(S) fixes a cell. Then Γ acts freely on Z (as it does on the contractible space [formula]) and so there is a Γ-equivariant homotopy equivalence [formula] relative to [formula]. It follows that we also have a homotopy equivalence [formula] relative to cg and we conclude that (cg,cg) is (g - 2)-connected. If we take Γ  ⊂  Γ(S) (beyond being torsion free) normal and of finite index in Γ(S), with finite quotient G, then [formula] for k  ≤  g - 2.

A similar statement holds for the universal curve Mg,1.

When n > 1, we need to come to terms with the fact that the separability notion has no good heriditary properties: if T is a closed surface, A  ⊂  T a compact 1-dimensional submanifold representing a simplex of C(T) and S a connected component of T - A, then a vertex of C(S) may split S, but not T. This happens precisely when the vertex in question separates two boundary components of ∂S that lie on the same connected component of T - S. So the basic object should be, what Andy Putman calls in [\cite=putman:cp], a partitioned surface: a closed surface minus a finite set, for which the removed set comes with a partition. This leads to the following definition.

Let N be the set of points of S at infinity (the cusps) and let P be a partition of N. We call a vertex of C(S) separating relative to P if a representative embedded circle α  ⊂  S has the property that S - α has two connected components each of which meets N in a union of parts of P. We denote by C(S,P) the full subcomplex of C(S) spanned by such vertices.

So [formula] and we have equality when P is discrete or N is empty.

We shall prove Theorem [\ref=thm:Ag] with induction simultaneously with

Suppose g > 0 and n = |N| > 1. Let P be a partition of N. Then C(S,P) is (g - 2)-connected.

I am indebted to Allen Hatcher for pointing out that the stronger version of Theorem [\ref=thm:Agn] that I stated in a previous version was incorrect. Yet it may be that some such statement might hold. For instance, if r(P) denotes the number of nonempty parts of P and s(P) the number of parts with at least two elements, is it true that C(S,P) is (g + r(P) + s(P) - 4)-connected when g > 0 (as I claimed in the earlier version)? In case g = 0, C(S,P) is a complex of dimension r(P) + s(P) - 4. Is this (r(P) + s(P) - 5)-connected? In other words, is this complex spherical?

Proofs

Before we start off, we mention the following elementary fact that we will frequently use.

Let Xi be a di-connected space (di =  - 1 means [formula]), where [formula]. Then the iterated join [formula] is [formula]-connected.

So here n  ≤  1. We must show that [formula] is (g - 3)-connected. For g < 2, there is nothing to show and so we may assume that g  ≥  2. A theorem of Harer [\cite=harer] asserts that C(S) is (2g - 3)-connected. So it is certainly (g - 3)-connected. Let Ck be the subcomplex of C(S) that is the union of [formula] and the k-skeleton of C(S). So [formula] and Ck  =  C(S) for k large. Notice that a finite set of vertices of C(S) spans a simplex of Ck if and only if no more than k + 1 of these are nonseparating. Hence a minimal simplex of Ck  -  Ck - 1 is represented by a compact 1-dimensional submanifold A  ⊂  S with k + 1 connected components, each of which is nonseparating. We prove that the link of such a simplex in Ck is a (g - 3)-connected subcomplex of Ck - 1. This property implies that |C(S)| is obtained from [formula] by attaching cells of dimension > g - 3 and since C(S) is (g - 3)-connected, it then follows that [formula] is. Let {Si}i∈I be the set of connected components of S - A. Notice that if gi is the genus of Si, then gi < g. An Euler characteristic argument shows that

[formula]

We denote by Ni the set of connected components of A that bound Si. The boundary components of the connected components of S - Si define a partition Pi of Ni. Since the connected components of A are nonseparating, |Ni|  ≥  2. By our induction hypothesis C(Si,Pi) is then (gi - 2)-connected. The link of the k-simplex σA defined by A in Ck lies in Ck - 1 and can be identified with the (|I| + 1)-fold join

[formula]

Since ∂σA is a combinatorial (k - 1)-sphere, it is (k - 2)-connected and so by Lemma [\ref=lemma:join] the link in question has connectivity at least

[formula]

The proof of Ag,n begins with a discussion. We now assume that g > 0 and n  ≥  2 and denote by [formula] the closed genus g surface obtained from S by adding its cusps.

Let x∈N. The goal is to compare C(S',P') with C(S,P). There is in general no forgetful map C(S,P)  →  C(S',P') because there will be vertices of C(S,P) that do not give vertices of C(S',P'). Let us first identify this set of vertices.

Denote by Σx  ⊂  N - {x} is the set of y∈N - {x} for which {x,y} is a union of parts of P. In other words, if Px denotes the part of P that contains x, then Σx is empty if Px has more than 2 elements, equals Px  -  {x} if Px is a 2-element set, and equals the set of [formula] for which Py is a singleton, in case Px  =  {x}. Then the set of vertices of C(S,P) that have no image in C(S',P') is precisely the set of vertices α of [formula] that for some y∈Σx bound a disk neighborhood of {x,y} in [formula] (so this set is empty if Σx is). Such a disk neighborhood can be thought of as a regular neighborhood of an arc in [formula] connecting the two added cusps; this may help to explain why we have chosen to denote this set of vertices by arc(S,P)(x). Denote by C(S,P)x the full subcomplex of C(S,P) spanned by the vertices not in arc(S,P)(x).

Observe that arc(S,P)(x) is empty (so that C(S,P)x  =  C(S,P)) is Σx is.

The link in C(S,P) of every vertex of arc(S,P)(x) is a subcomplex of C(S,P)x that projects isomorphically onto C(S',P').

A vertex of arc(S,P)(x) defines a y∈Σx and (up to isotopy) a closed disk D in [formula] that is a neighborhood of {x,y}. We may identify the link in question with [formula] and the latter clearly maps isomorphically onto C(S',P').

Denote by P̃ the refinement of P which coincides with P on N - Px and partitions Px further into {x} and Px  -  {x}. So P̃' = P'. It is clear that C(S,P) is a subcomplex of C(S,P̃). Notice that [formula] (we have arc(S,P)(x) = arc(S,P̃)(x) unless |Px| = 2) and [formula].

The simplicial map f:C(S,P̃)x  →  C(S',P') is a homotopy equivalence.

Let us first observe the following. The map f is equivariant for the actions of mapping class group Γ(S) (acting via Γ(S') on C(S',P')). The kernel of Γ(S)  →  Γ(S') may be identified with the fundamental group π1(S',x), so that the latter permutes the simplices of C(S,P̃)x that lie over any given simplex of C(S',P').

Let σ be a k-simplex of C(S',P'). It is enough to prove that the preimage of |σ| is contractible. Let σ be given by the compact one-dimensional submanifold A of S' with k + 1 connected components. This submanifold is unique up to isotopy in S'. If our representative A happens to avoid x, then it also defines a k-simplex of C(S,P̃)x. If a component α of A passes through x, then we may define a (k + 1)-simplex in C(S,P̃)x by replacing α by the boundary of a thin regular neighborhood of α in S'. If we allow A to vary in its S'-isotopy class, then we thus produce all the simplices of C(S,P̃)x that map onto σ.

In order to describe the fiber of |f| over the relative interior of |σ|, we choose a universal cover S̃'  →  S' of S'. Its total space is homeomorphic to an open disk. The preimage Ã of a A in S̃' is a closed one dimensional submanifold of which any connected component connects two boundary points of S̃'. (A clearer picture is perhaps obtained if we choose a hyperbolic structure on S' for which the points of N' are cusps and each component of A is a closed geodesic, for then S̃' is a copy of the upper half plane and each component of Ã is a complete geodesic in S̃'.) The fundamental group of a connected component of S' - A maps injectively to the fundamental group of S'. This implies that each connected component of S̃' - Ã is simply connected and hence is contractible (in terms of hyperbolic geometry: it is a hyperbolic polygon with all its vertices--infinite in number--improper). So the closures of the connected components of S̃' - Ã define a Leray covering of S̃'. If we denote its nerve by Kσ, then the geometric realization |Kσ| has the homotopy type of S̃', hence is contractible. In other words, Kσ is a tree. It is not hard to see that |Kσ| can be identified with the fiber of |f| over the relative interior of |σ|.

The situation over all of |σ| is not much different: if τ  ≤  σ is obtained by omitting a number of connected components of A, then the associated partition of S̃' becomes coarser and we have an obvious simplicial map Kσ  →  Kτ of trees. The simplicial scheme over σ that we thus obtain is has still a contractible geometric realization. But this simplicial scheme is also the part of the barycentric subdivision of C(S,P̃) that lies over σ.

The complex [formula] is canonically homotopy equivalent to the join [formula] (where arc(S,P)(x) is discrete).

The set of vertices of [formula] not in C(S,P̃)x is arc(S,P)(x). The link of any such vertex is contained in C(S,P̃)x and by Lemma [\ref=lemma:link] that link projects isomorphically onto C(S',P'). In view of Lemma [\ref=lemma:htp] this implies that the inclusion of this link in C(S,P̃)x is also a homotopy equivalence. Hence the natural inclusion [formula] is a homotopy equivalence. The corollary follows.

From now on we assume that Ag holds and that Ah,k holds for all (h,k) smaller than (g,n) for the lexicographic ordering. Our goal is to prove Ag,n.

The pair [formula] is (g - 1)-connected.

If Px  =  {x}, then P̃  =  P and there is nothing to show. We therefore assume that Px has more than one element. Denote by Ck the subcomplex of [formula] that is the union of C(S,P) and the k-skeleton of [formula]. So C- 1  =  C(S,P) and [formula] for k large. A finite set of vertices of [formula] spans a simplex of Ck if and only if no more than k + 1 of these separate x from Px  -  {x}. So a minimal simplex of Ck  -  Ck - 1 is represented by a compact 1-dimensional submanifold A  ⊂  S with k + 1 connected components, each of which separates x from Px  -  {x} (the graph that is associated to A is then a string with k + 2 nodes). We prove that the link of such a simplex in Ck - 1 is (g - 2)-connected if g > 0. This will suffice.

We enumerate the connected components of A as [formula] and the connected components of S - A as [formula] such that αi is a boundary component of Si and Si + 1 and so that S0 resp. Sk + 1 is punctured by x resp.  Px  -  {x}. So if we put [formula], then the set of cusps of Si is naturally indexed by a subset N̂i of N̂ and these subsets partition N̂. Observe that |N̂i|  ≥  2 for every i. Denote by Pi the partition of [formula] that is simply the restriction of P and denote by P̂i the partition of N̂i that is on [formula] equal to Pi and has the remainder (i.e., [formula]) as a single part. So this new part is [formula] for i = 0, {i - 1,i} for 0 < i < k + 1 and [formula] for i = k + 1.

The reason for introducing these partitions is that we can now observe that the link of the k-simplex σA defined by A in Ck lies in Ck - 1 and can be identified with the iterated join

[formula]

It is then enough to show that this join is (g - 2)-connected for g > 0. Since ∂σA is a (k - 1)-sphere, it is (k - 2)-connected. The connectivity of a factor C(Si,P̂i) with gi > 0 is at least gi - 2. So by Lemma [\ref=lemma:join] the connectivity of the above join is at least [formula].

We must show that C(S,P) is (g - 2)-connected. In view of Lemma [\ref=lemma:connect] is suffices to show that [formula] has that property.

If [formula], then n > 2 and so our induction hypothesis implies that C(S',P') is (g - 2)-connected by Ag,n - 1. It follows from Corollary [\ref=cor:connect] that [formula] is homotopy equivalent to C(S',P') and hence is (g - 2)-connected.

If [formula], then we may have n = 2. At least we know that C(S',P') is (g - 3)-connected (invoke Ag if n = 2). But since [formula] is homotopy equivalent to [formula] (by Corollary [\ref=cor:connect]), it is (g - 2)-connected.
