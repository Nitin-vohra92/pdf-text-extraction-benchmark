A novel method for determining the phase-response curves of neurons based on minimizing spike-time prediction error

Introduction

The phase response curve (PRC) is a property of oscillators that defines how the phase of the next cycle is shifted by an incoming perturbation at a particular phase. In the case of regular firing neurons, the PRC describes how the timing of the next spike is shifted. The PRC is of interest for several reasons. First, by using the PRC a prediction can be made about the synchronizing properties of synoptically coupled neurons. Nonnegative PRCs (i.e., type-I PRCs or monophasic PRCs) do not allow for synchronization via excitatory connections while PRCs with a negative part (i.e., type-II PRCs or biphasic PRCs) allow for synchronization in networks with excitatory coupling and small conduction delays [\cite=hansel1995]. Second, the PRC type indicates which bifurcation type leads to the transition from non-spiking to spiking behavior [\cite=izhikevich2007]. Moreover, the PRC type correlates with the type of excitability of a neuron [\cite=hodgkin1952] [\cite=marella2008]. As such, the PRC is an important characterizing feature of regularly firing neurons.

The PRC can be easily understood when projecting the higher-dimensional dynamics of a model of a neuron to a one-dimensional system, i.e., when a neuron is seen as an oscillator, with its state determined by the phase φ. The unperturbed state of the neuron is then described as [formula], with [formula] and T the average inter-spike interval. With the introduction of noise [formula] of small amplitude α, the state of the neuron is described as

[formula]

where [formula] is the PRC. By using a shorthand notation φ  =  φ(t) we can describe the spike times of the regularly firing neuron as

[formula]

Thus, the firing times of the neuron is determined by the period ω, the noise signal and the PRC Z(φ).

The PRC of a neuron is usually estimated from experimental data by the direct method in which small, brief current-pulses are injected at different phases and the phase shifts of the next spike are recorded. By following the definition of the PRC, the phase of the perturbation is plotted on the x-axis and the resultant shift in normalized spike time (phase) on the y-axis. In practice, neuron spike times display a large amount of jitter and therefore it is necessary to measure the spike time shifts in hundreds of inter-spike intervals at random phases to span all phases and to obtain a reliable readout.

An alternative method was proposed by Izhikevich [\cite=izhikevich2007], where continuous current fluctuation was injected instead of brief pulses. Subsequently, by summing the effects of the injected fluctuations between two spikes as predicted by a a candidate PRC, the time of the next spike is estimated. The summed difference between the observed and predicted spike times is then used as an error signal to optimize the PRC. In practice this method does not converge within a reasonable number of optimization rounds (e.g., 5000 iterations with a basic simplex optimization algorithm). The inability to converge is likely caused by (i) the loss of temporal information when the errors are summed, and (ii) the fact that many candidate PRCs can have the same error value. We thus developed an extension of this method which does not sum over these two dimensions and instead uses an array of error signals that preserve the phase information to optimize the PRCs.

Our novel method, the STEP (Standardized Error Prediction) method, allows for an reliable estimation of the PRC with relatively few spikes and at high noise levels. The STEP method is a numerical method based on the assumption that the effects of small perturbations on the PRCs are independent and treating them independently preserves temporal information.

Methods

Experimental procedure

We consider a neuron that is brought to regular firing by a constant current injection (step current Is). When stabilized, the considered neuron fires with a period of [formula], where T is the average interspike interval. A continuous fluction is imposed on top of Is and the combined signal is defined as x(t) (the total current injected into the neuron). In the STEP method, the PRC is approximated by a truncated Fourier series [formula] where z(φ) is a candidate PRC of which [formula] and [formula] are subject to optimization. The optimization is guided by the distance between predicted spike times i to the real spike times si. We implicitly normalize the duration of the fluctuating signal between subsequent spikes by equating this interval to

[formula]

Model neuron and experimental data

We use three data sets to test our method. The first data set contains noise-free model data in which a single compartmental model neuron (see below) is perturbed at different phases. This set contains 128 perturbations evenly spaced over

[formula]

Results

To calibrate the data, we injected short pulses at different phases and directly recorded the phase shift. Afterwards, we ran the STEP method on the perturbation data and found that the resulting PRC matches well with the directly determined PRC (Figure [\ref=fig:calibrated]). The slight mismatch at the end of the period in type-I data and middle of the type-II data is due to the short expansion (3rd order) of the Fourier series. Longer expansion tend to provide a better fit but are prone to over-fitting (not shown).

Having established that STEP method works well with simple perturbation, we tested our method on the more realistic case in which a continuous fluctuation signal perturbs the neuron. The PRCs for the four different noise levels Figure [\ref=fig:noise] (bottom left) and indicate that at all noise levels the PRC correctly displays type-II characteristics (a substantial negative part).

An important feature of any method to estimate the PRC is its sensitivity to the number of spikes because large numbers of spikes are hard to obtain experimentally. For this reason, we tested our method with 50, 100 and 500 spikes (Figure [\ref=fig:noise], right). We observe that the STEP algorithm provides a fair estimation with a minimum of 100 spikes. This number of required spikes is much lower than most other methods, for instance the STA method [\cite=ermentrout2007] is shown to work with 7000 spikes, Galan's method [\cite=galan2005] with 480 spikes and the WSTA method [\cite=ota2009] with 'a few hundred' spikes.

Finally, we tested our method on experimental data obtained from mouse layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in the visual cortex. Unfortunately, the PRC types for such neurons are not known as there is experimental evidence that Layer 2/3 neurons can possess both types of PRC [\cite=stiefel2009]. To give an indication that our method works well with experimental data we used a strategy outlined in [\cite=galan2005] in which we compare the PRC produced with all spike data to two PRCs produced with only half of all spiking data. If all the resulting PRCs resemble each other, the PRCs are unlikely to contain under- or over-fitting artifacts and can therefore be considered representative for the provided data. Figure [\ref=fig:experimental] shows these results.

We may state that the STEP method is a reliable method to estimate the PRC from experimental data. The advantages of the STEP method are the low number of required spikes and the robustness at higher noise levels.
