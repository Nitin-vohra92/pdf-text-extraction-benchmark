Bound on distributed entanglement

Introduction

Quantum entanglement plays a crucial role in various kinds of quantum information tasks such as quantum teleportation, dense coding, and quantum cryptography [\cite=tele] [\cite=qkd1] [\cite=qkd2]. Whereas shared entanglement between different parties is generally consumed as a resource in the tasks of quantum informational processing, generating entangled states is usually expensive in practice. Furthermore, due to the fragile nature of quantum entanglement, entanglement in quantum states (and thus its non-classical ability for quantum information tasks) may be gradually destroyed under the interaction with the environment, which is known as the decoherence. On this account, it must be an important and necessary task to provide an efficient way to create or distribute entanglement between desired parties, and hence it is surely meaningful to quantify the possible amount of entanglement distributed under given restricted conditions.

As a generalization of the entanglement swapping [\cite=ZZHE] [\cite=ZHWZ] [\cite=BVK], the distribution of entanglement through quantum networks was characterized in qubit systems by using the concurrence [\cite=ww] as a measure of bipartite entanglement: If we have two states ρAB and ρCD in two-qubit systems AB and CD respectively, the possible entanglement, which can be remotely distributed on the system AC by arbitrary measurement on the system BD and classical communication, was shown to be always bounded above by the product of two amounts of entanglement for ρAB and ρCD [\cite=gs]. Later, this bound was generalized to arbitrary qudit systems by using the G-concurrence [\cite=g] as another bipartite entanglement measure.

However, for a bipartite pure state in a [formula] quantum system, the G-concurrence is defined as the dth root of the determinant of its reduced density matrix with a proper normalization. Although the G-concurrence has several good properties such as computability and multiplicativity [\cite=g], it can only detect genuine d-dimensional entanglement (that is, a bipartite pure state has a non-zero value of G-concurrence if and only if its reduced density matrix has full rank), and thus it has zero value for a lot of entangled states in two-qudit systems whose reduced density matrices are not of full rank. In other words, the G-concurrence cannot even give us a separability criterion, which is one of requirements necessary for entanglement measures.

Another well-known quantification of bipartite entanglement is the negativity [\cite=VidalW], which is based on the positive partial transposition (PPT) criterion [\cite=Peres] [\cite=Horodeckis1]. The PPT condition is known to provide us with a separability criterion in the two-qubit system, and also a necessary and sufficient condition for nondistillability in [formula] quantum systems [\cite=Horodecki1] [\cite=DCLB]. However, in higher-dimensional quantum systems rather than [formula] and [formula] systems, there exist mixed entangled states with PPT, the so-called PPT bound entangled states [\cite=Horodecki1] [\cite=Horodeckis2], that is, there exist entangled states whose negativity values are not positive.

In order to overcome the lack of separability criterion for mixed states, the negativity can be modified by means of the convex-roof extension, which takes the minimal average of negativity values over all possible pure-state decompositions. This modified negativity for mixed states is called the convex-roof extended negativity (CREN) [\cite=LCOK], and it gives a perfect discrimination between PPT bound entangled states and separable states in any bipartite quantum system.

Here, we provide a new bound for remotely-distributed entanglement (RDE) using CREN and its dual quantity, the negativity of assistance (NoA) [\cite=kds]. Given a pair of pure states [formula] and [formula] in two bipartite systems AB and CD respectively, we first show that the possible RDE on the system AC by joint measurement on the system BD is not less than the product of two amounts of CREN for [formula] and [formula] in two-qubit and two-qutrit systems. For [formula] quantum systems (d  ≥  4), we provide some sufficient conditions of [formula] and [formula], for which the result in lower-dimensional systems can be generalized.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section [\ref=Subsec:_definition], we recall the definition of negativity, CREN, and NoA. In Section [\ref=Subsec:_lbound], we derive an analytic lower bound of possible RDE for arbitrary dimensional quantum systems. In Section [\ref=Subsec:_qubits_and_qutrits], we establish the inequality for the lower bound of the possible RDE in low-dimensional quantum systems with respect to CREN and NoA. In Section [\ref=Subsec:_qudits], we provide some sufficient conditions, for which the result in low-dimensional systems can be generalized into arbitrary dimensional systems, and we summarize our results in Section [\ref=Sec:_Conclusions].

Convex-roof Extended Negativity and Negativity of Assistance

In this section, we recall the definitions of CREN and NoA for bipartite quantum states. We also provide an analytic lower bound of the distributed entanglement of ρAC, which can be remotely prepared from two bipartite states [formula] and [formula] by a joint measurement in the system BD.

Definitions

For a bipartite state ρAB in a [formula] quantum system, its negativity N(ρAB) is defined as

[formula]

where [formula] is the trace norm, d=min {dA,dB}, and ρTBAB is the partial transposition of ρAB [\cite=VidalW]. For the case when ρAB is a pure state [formula] with the following Schmidt decomposition,

[formula]

(without loss of generality, we may assume that the Schmidt basis is taken to be the standard basis), its negativity can also be expressed in terms of its Schmidt coefficients, that is,

[formula]

In order to compensate for the lack of separability criterion in the negativity, CREN for a mixed state ρAB is defined as

[formula]

where the minimum is taken over all possible pure state decompositions of [formula].

In addition to separability criterion, CREN is known to be a good entanglement measure in bipartite quantum systems with the property of entanglement monotone: CREN does not increase under local operations and classical communication [\cite=LCOK]. Furthermore, as in the definition of entanglement of formation [\cite=bdsw], CREN can also be considered as the amount of entanglement needed to prepare the state ρAB quantified by the negativity, that is, the concept of formation.

As a dual quantity to CREN, NoA is defined as

[formula]

where the maximum is taken over all possible pure-state decompositions of ρAB [\cite=kds].

For the case when ρAB is a pure state, its CREN as well as its NoA coincide with the original negativity, that is,

[formula]

for any pure state [formula].

We note that NoA in Eq. ([\ref=NoA]) is mathematically dual to CREN in Eq. ([\ref=CREN]) because one of them is the minimal average of entanglement over all possible pure-state decompositions whereas the other is defined as the maximal one. Moreover, if we introduce a reference system C for a purification of ρAB, it can be easily shown that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of all possible pure-state decompositions of ρAB and the set of all possible rank-one measurements on the system C. In other words, Na(ρAB) is the maximal entanglement that can be distributed between the systems A and B with the assistance of the environment C, whereas Nc(ρAB) is the minimal amount of entanglement needed to prepare ρAB. Thus, NoA can also be considered as the quantity physically dual to CREN; the possible distribution versus the concept of formation.

Analytic Lower Bound of the Distributed Entanglement

Let us consider two-qudit pure states [formula] and [formula] in two bipartite quantum systems AB and CD respectively, and let

[formula]

be a maximally entangled state in [formula] quantum systems where ω  =   exp (2πi / d) is the dth root of unity. (Throughout this paper, all indices are considered to be integers modulo d.) The set [formula] forms an orthonormal basis for the [formula] quantum system, and we furthermore have

[formula]

for each [formula]. Thus it follows that

[formula]

Assume that the system BD is measured in the basis S and the measurement outcome is [formula] for some k and l. Then the resulting state in the system AC is the normalized vector of

[formula]

where rk,l is the probability of the measurement outcome, that is, [formula].

Because we have [formula] for any unnormalized state [formula] with [formula], the average negativity that can be distributed on the system AC from the state [formula] in Eq. ([\ref=abcd]) by the joint measurement on the system BD with respect to the basis S is

[formula]

Thus, from Eq. ([\ref=ave]) together with the definition of NoA in Eq. ([\ref=NoA]), we have

[formula]

where [formula], which is an analytic lower bound of the possible RDE onto the system AC.

Remark that, for arbitrary pair of pure bipartite states, the bound in ([\ref=eq:_bound]) also holds since local unitary operations preserve the inequality, and that the bound is a tight one since it is straightforward to check that the inequality is saturated when both [formula] and [formula] are maximally entangled states.

Bound on Possible Remotely-Distributed Entanglement

In this section, using the analytic lower bound in ([\ref=eq:_bound]), we show that the possible RDE on the system AC by joint measurement on system BD is not less than the product of two amounts of entanglement for [formula] and [formula] for several cases, by employing CREN and NoA.

Low-dimensional systems: Qubits and Qutrits

We first consider the case that d = 2. Then we have [formula] and [formula]. In this case, the right-hand side of the inequality ([\ref=eq:_bound]) becomes

[formula]

and we have

[formula]

We now take account of the case that d = 3. Then we have [formula] and [formula]. As in the case that d = 2, the right-hand side of the inequality ([\ref=eq:_bound]) becomes

[formula]

which is equal to [formula]. Therefore, we are ready to have the following theorem.

General Quantum Systems

While there is a simple equality between the right-hand side of the inequality ([\ref=eq:_bound]) and [formula] in low-dimensional quantum systems, it can be easily checked that such a direct equality does not hold for general case of higher-dimensional systems when [formula]. Here, we provide two sufficient conditions for general states of [formula] and [formula] to have the same relation as in the inequality ([\ref=eq:dbound]).

One simple sufficient condition is that [formula] or [formula] is a d-dimensional maximally entangled state. Suppose [formula] is a maximally entangled state, that is,

[formula]

Because [formula], it can be easily checked that the right-hand side of the inequality ([\ref=eq:_bound]) becomes

[formula]

Hence, in this case, we can readily obtain the same inequality as in ([\ref=eq:dbound]).

Now, let us consider another sufficient condition that the states [formula] and [formula] have the same Schmidt coefficients, that is, pj  =  qj for each [formula].

First assume that d  ≥  3 is odd. Then there exist a positive integer n such that d = 2n + 1. Let us define a set S as

[formula]

and, for each [formula], its subset Pl as

[formula]

where all indices are integers modulo d as mentioned before. It is then straightforward to check that the subsets Pl and Pl' do not intersect with each other if l  ≠  l', and [formula]. In other words, Pl's form a partition of the set S.

Now, for each [formula], let

[formula]

which is the sum of all elements in Pl. Then the right-hand side of the inequality ([\ref=eq:_bound]) becomes

[formula]

Furthermore, we obtain

[formula]

By letting [formula] and [formula], we have the following equalities

[formula]

which is clearly nonnegative. Hence, it follows that

[formula]

We now assume that d is even such that d = 2m for some positive integer m. Similarly, for each [formula], let us define the subset Ql of the set S in Eq. ([\ref=S]) as

[formula]

and the subset Qm as

[formula]

Then it is also straightforward to check that [formula] is the empty set for l  ≠  l' and [formula]. Let us define

[formula]

for each [formula], and

[formula]

which are the sums of all elements in Ql for [formula] and Qm, respectively.

Now, the right-hand side of the inequality ([\ref=eq:_bound]) becomes

[formula]

Moreover, we have

[formula]

By letting [formula] and [formula], we obtain which is clearly nonnegative as well. Therefore, it follows that

[formula]

Now, we are ready to have the following theorem.

Due to the continuity of the inequality ([\ref=eq:_dbound]) with respect to the Schmidt coefficients of [formula] and [formula], we note here that Theorem [\ref=Thm:_dbound] also holds if [formula] and [formula] have similar Schmidt coefficients to each other, or one of them is nearly maximally entangled.

Summary

We have provided the bound for RDE using CREN and NoA. For a pair of pure states [formula] and [formula] in quantum systems AB and CD respectively, we have shown that the possible RDE on AC by joint measurement of BD, [formula], is bounded below by the product of two amounts of entanglement in terms of CREN or the negativity, [formula], for the case of low-dimensional quantum systems. We have also presented some sufficient conditions of the states [formula] and [formula], for which the result of low-dimensional systems can be generalized into higher-dimensional quantum systems. Our result also provides an operational interpretation of NoA as the capacity of possible RDE.
