On a Generalization of the Frobenius Number

The linear diophantine problem of Frobenius has long been a celebrated problem in number theory. Most simply put, the problem is to find the Frobenius Number of k positive relatively prime integers [formula], i.e., the greatest integer M for which there is no way to express M as the non-negative integral linear combination of the given ai.

A generalization, which has drawn interest both from classical study of the Frobenius Problem ([\cite=Alf]) and from the perspective of partition functions and integer points in polytopes (as in Beck and Robins [\cite=1]), is to ask for the greatest integer M which can be expressed in exactly j different ways. We make this precise with the following definitions:

A representation of M by a k-tuple [formula] of non-negative, relatively prime integers is a solution [formula] to the equation [formula].

We define the j-Frobenius Number of a k-tuple [formula] of relatively prime positive integers to be the greatest integer M with exactly j representations of M by [formula] if such a positive integer exists and zero otherwise. We refer to this quantity as [formula].

Finally we define [formula] exactly as we defined [formula], except that we consider only positive representations [formula].

Note that the 0-Frobenius of [formula] is the classical Frobenius Number. The purpose of this paper is to show the following generalization of a result of Brauer and Shockley [\cite=2] on the classical Frobenius Number.

If [formula] and j  ≥  0, then either

[formula]

or [formula]

If [formula] is nonzero, there exist integers [formula] such that

[formula]

Let [formula]. By the definition of fj, we can write [formula] with [formula] for [formula]. Since

[formula]

we obtain at least j positive representations of fj  +  a1. As fj is the largest number with exactly j positive representations, there must be at least j + 1 distinct ways to represent fj  +  a1. Specifically, we have [formula] with [formula] for all [formula]. Subtract a1 from both sides of these j + 1 equations to obtain [formula]. Evidently, there exists some [formula] for which [formula] because fj cannot have j + 1 positive representations. Therefore, [formula]

If [formula], then

[formula]

Let ai = da'i for [formula] and [formula]. Assuming N > 0, we know by Lemma [\ref=lemma] that

[formula]

with xi > 0. Let [formula]. We want to show that [formula] and will do this in three steps. Step 1: First, we know that N' does not have j + 1 or more positive representations by [formula]. If N' could be so represented, then for 1  ≤  l  ≤  j + 1 we would have

[formula]

Multiplying this equation by d immediately produces too many representations of N and thus a contradiction. Step 2: Next, we know that

[formula]

for 1  ≤  l  ≤  j and xi > 0, so

[formula]

Since d|N and d|ai for i  ≥  2, we must have [formula] for [formula]. In addition, [formula] so we must have [formula] for [formula]. So

[formula]

hence N' has at least j distinct positive representations. But we have already shown that N' cannot have j + 1 or more positive representations, thus N' has exactly j positive representations. Step 3: Finally we will show that N' is the largest number with exactly j positive representations by [formula]. Consider any n > N'. Since dn > dN' = N, we know that dn can be represented as a linear combination of [formula] in exactly X ways with [formula]. Thus, for 1  ≤  l  ≤  X and [formula] we have

[formula]

and as in Step 2,

[formula]

If X > j then we certainly do not have exactly j representations, so assume X < j. Assume now that we can write [formula] where [formula] for any such [formula]. By multiplying by d we get a new representation for dn, which is a contradiction because dn is represented in exactly [formula] ways. Therefore N' is the greatest number with exactly j positive representations and so

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

Having established our results about [formula], we show that we can translate these results to results about the j-Frobenius Numbers.

Either [formula] or,

[formula]

For ease, write fj for [formula], gj for [formula], and [formula]. Any representation [formula] of M gives a representation [formula] of M + K. Moreover, adding or subtracting K preserves the distinctness of representations because it adjusts every coefficient yi by 1. Therefore if M has j representations, M + K has at least j positive representations. Likewise, every positive representation of M + K gives a representation of M. Thus fj = 0 if and only if gj = 0. Assume now that fj and gj are both nonzero. Suppose that fj  <  gj  +  K. By definition, we can find exactly j representations [formula] for gj and gj has exactly j representations if and only if gj  +  K has exactly j positive representations [formula]. However, by assumption gj  +  K > fj and gj + K has exactly j positive representations. This contradicts the definition of fj, hence fj  ≥  gj  +  K. Suppose that fj  >  gj  +  K. By definition, we can find exactly j positive representations [formula] for fj. The same argument as above shows that fj  -  K has exactly j representations in contradiction to the definition of gj. Thus fj  ≤  gj  +  K.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=bigresult]: Combine Theorem [\ref=theorem] with Lemma [\ref=lemma2].

Let a1,a2 be coprime positive integers and let m be a positive integer. Suppose that gj  =  gj(a1,a2,ma1a2)  ≠  0. Then

gj  =  (j + 1)a1a2  -  a1 - a2 for j < m + 1

gm + 1  =  0 and

gm + 2  =  (m + 2)a1a2 - a1 - a2.

Theorem [\ref=bigresult] tells us that if gj(1,1,m)  ≠  0 then

[formula]

Following Beck and Robins in [\cite=1], we can use the values of the restricted partition function p1,1,m(k) to determine gj(1,1,m). Furthermore we can determine the relevant values with the Taylor series [formula]. Now recall that for k < m, p1,1,m(k)  =  p1,1(k)  =  k + 1 but p1,1,m(m)  =  m + 2 and for all k > m, p1,1,m(k) > m + 2. Note that no number is represented m + 1 times. Thus gm + 1(1,1,m)  =  0, gj(1,1,m)  =  j - 1 for j < m and gm + 2(1,1,m)  =  m.

Remark. It is a consequence of the asymptotic in Nathanson [\cite=3] that for a given tuple, there may be many j for which gj = 0, so the ordering [formula] may not hold. In the process of discovering these equalities, we noted the somewhat stranger occurrence of tuples where 0 < gj + 1  <  gj.

Take for instance, the 3-tuple (3, 5, 8). The order [formula] holds until g14 = 52 and g15 = 51. As should also be the case, the 3-tuple increased by a factor of d = 2 creates the new "dependent" 3-tuple (3, 10, 16), which fails to hold order in the same position with g14 = 107 and g15 = 105. A few independent examples are as follows:

g17(2,5,7)  =  43 and g18(2,5,7)  =  42,

g38(2,5,17) = 103 and g39(2,5,17) = 102,

g35(4,7,19) = 181 and g36(4,7,19) = 180, and

g38(9,11,20) = 376 and g39(9,11,20) = 369.

We do not as of yet know a lower bound on j for the above to occur. Indeed, in every case we have computed, if g0,g1 > 0 then g1 > g0, but to date neither a proof or a counterexample has presented itself.
