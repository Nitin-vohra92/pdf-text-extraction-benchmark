Orbits for products of maps

Introduction

A fundamental topological invariant of a dynamical system - here thought of as a continuous map T:X  →  X of a compact metric space - is its orbit-counting data. Analytic properties of functions capturing this data have been widely exploited in dynamics. Recently the authors [\cite=MR2486259] studied functorial properties of orbit-counting functions, relating disjoint unions, Cartesian products, and iterates of maps to corresponding operations on the orbit-counting functions. Here we focus on some analytic questions in the same spirit, a simple example being this: What is the relationship between the analytic properties of the dynamical zeta functions ζT1, ζT2 and ζT1  ×  T2? Similar questions arise for the orbit Dirichlet series introduced in [\cite=emsw], where analytic properties are directly related by Tauberian theorems to the usual orbit-growth function πT.

In order to highlight the underlying combinatorial questions, we take a cavalier attitude to maps in the following sense. For any sequence [formula] of non-negative integers, there is (manifestly) a map on [formula] with an closed orbits of length n for each [formula]; via a compactification there is a continuous map on a compact metric space with the same property; finally, via a beautiful theorem of Windsor [\cite=MR2422026], there is a C∞ diffeomorphism of the two-torus with the same property. Thus all our remarks below may be seen as being about abstract combinatorial maps or about (unspecified) smooth examples. In the former setting, the paradigmatic examples are those for which the sequence a is arithmetically simple, the prototype being a map with exactly one orbit of each length, with the natural analytic tool being the orbit Dirichlet series. In the latter setting, the paradigmatic example might be an Axiom A diffeomorphism of the torus, with the natural tool being the dynamical zeta function. Thus two examples of the arguments below are the following. Firstly, if T has one orbit of each length, then the orbit Dirichlet series [formula] is the Riemann zeta function, and a calculation shows that [formula], with abscissa of convergence at 2 and a meromorphic extension to the plane; more surprising is the fact that for the Cartesian cube we find that [formula] has abscissa of convergence at 3, a meromorphic extension to [formula], and a natural boundary at [formula]. This is a striking instance of a naturally-occurring Dirichlet series with a natural boundary. Secondly, if T1 and T2 are maps with rational dynamical zeta functions, what relates the discs of convergence of ζT1 and ζT2 to that of ζT1  ×  T2?

Products and Iterates

Let T (or [formula]) be maps. A closed orbit τ of length |τ| is a set of the form [formula] with cardinality |τ|; write [formula] for the number of closed orbits of length n under T. We always assume that [formula] for all [formula].

The number of points of period n (that is, the number of points fixed by the iterate Tn) is [formula]. The dynamical zeta function associated to T is the function

[formula]

with radius of convergence [formula] (which may be zero), and the orbit Dirichlet series associated to T is

[formula]

convergent on a (possibly empty) half-plane [formula], where [formula] is the abscissa of convergence. Analytic properties of ζT and [formula] may be used in several ways, the most immediate being that asymptotics for

[formula]

may be found via Tauberian theorems. The usual Möbius relation between the sequences [formula] and [formula] means that

[formula]

and, viewed via the Euler transform, the same relation means that

[formula]

Clearly [formula] for all [formula], and as pointed out in [\cite=MR2486259], it follows that

[formula]

(this may be seen using [\eqref=andtheycamefromeverywhere] or by pure thought). The arithmetic properties of the operation [\eqref=shecamefromprovidence] are rather subtle.

Turning now to iterates of a single map (rather than products of pairs of maps), write D(n) for the set of prime divisors of [formula], and for a prime decomposition [formula] and a subset J  ⊂  D(n), write [formula] for the restricted product [formula]. The basic formula for orbit-counting under iteration is found in [\cite=MR2486259]: if [formula] and [formula], then

[formula]

In this expression J depends on n, so it involves a splitting into cases depending on the set of primes dividing n. The corresponding formula for fixed points is once again trivial: [formula] for all [formula].

The quadratic map [formula] on the interval

[formula]

In pursuit of the behaviour of the abscissa of convergence for products, Ramanujan's formula [\cite=45.1250.01] for the Dirichlet series with coefficients σa(n)σb(n) may be used together with [\eqref=shecamefromprovidence] to give the following (the detailed calculation is in the first author's thesis [\cite=pakapongpun]).

Let T1 be map with na orbits of length n and let T2 be a map with nb orbits of length n, so that [formula] and [formula]. Then

[formula]

Thus [formula] in this case. Perron's theorem applies to show that

[formula]

Let T1 be the full shift on a symbols, and T2 the full shift on b symbols, so that ζT1(z) = 1 / (1 - az) and ζT2(z) = 1 / (1 - bz). Clearly in this case ζT1  ×  T2(z) = 1 / (1 - abz), so ϱ(ζT1  ×  T2) = ϱ(ζT1)ϱ(ζT2).

Our first result is that the phenomena in Example [\ref=shepackedherhopesanddreams] holds for rational zeta functions. Recall that a linear recurrence sequence is said to be non-degenerate if among the non-trivial ratios of zeros of the characteristic polynomial no unit roots are found (see [\cite=MR1990179]), and we say that a rational zeta function ζT is non-degenerate if the linear recurrence sequence satisfied by the sequence [formula] is non-degenerate.

If ζT1 and ζT2 are non-degenerate rational functions, then ϱ(ζTk1) = ϱ(ζT1)k, and ϱ(ζT1  ×  T2) = ϱ(ζT1)ϱ(ζT2).

The first assertion is immediate: if ζT1 is rational, then by [\cite=MR0271401] there are algebraic numbers [formula] and [formula] with

[formula]

giving the statement at once.

The second statement is more delicate. If

[formula]

for j = 1,2 then

[formula]

Thus ϱ(ζT1  ×  T2) is the reciprocal of

[formula]

and we claim that the reciprocal of [\eqref=justasherfathercameacrossthesea] is equal to

[formula]

That is, the exponential growth due to the poles of the zeta function dominates the growth due to the zeros. In simple cases like Example [\ref=shepackedherhopesanddreams] this is obvious, but in general account needs to be taken of possible cancellation among terms of equal modulus in [\eqref=sheheardaboutaplacepeopleweresmiling].

If ζT is a non-degenerate zeta function with [\eqref=sheheardaboutaplacepeopleweresmiling], then

[formula]

If max {|αi|,|βj|} < 1 then [formula] as n  →    ∞  , so [formula] for all large n, and therefore the function is degenerate (see [\cite=MR1990179]). It follows that [formula]. If max {|αi|} = 1, then [formula] since [formula] for all [formula] and we are done. Assume therefore that max {|αi|} > 1, and for the purposes of a contradiction assume that

[formula]

and choose ε > 0 so that

[formula]

By [\cite=MR0271401] the numbers αi and βj are algebraic numbers (indeed, are reciprocals of algebraic integers), so that the estimates of Evertse [\cite=MR766298] or van der Poorten and Schlickewei [\cite=MR1119694] may be applied to see that there is an N(T,ε) with

[formula]

for [formula]. Then, by [\eqref=theyspokeabouttheredmansways],

[formula]

which would make [formula] negative for large n, an impossibility.

This completes the proof, since Lemma [\ref=andhowtheylovedtheland] shows that ϱ(ζTj) =  max {|β(j)i|} for j = 1,2 and that ϱ(ζT1  ×  T2) is the product.

The next two examples show that the relationships found in Theorem [\ref=likearefugee] do not hold in general.

Let [formula] be the set of primes written in order, and let [formula], [formula] be the primes of even and of odd index respectively. Let Tj be a map with

[formula]

for j = 1,2, where A1 = 2 and A2 = 3. Then [formula], and so

[formula]

as k  →    ∞   for each j = 1,2. On the other hand, a simple induction argument shows that

[formula]

for distinct [formula], so Aj is in fact the upper limit in [\eqref=tothegreatdivide], and ϱ(ζTj) = 1 / Aj for j = 1,2. Turning to the product, let n = n1n2, where

[formula]

with qi,j∈Pj and ai,j > 0. Then

[formula]

and straightforward estimates show that

[formula]

Thus, for this example, ϱ(ζT1  ×  T2) < ϱ(ζT1)ϱ(ζT2).

The map T1 from Example [\ref=downinthecrowdedbars] has 2n orbits of length n if n∈P1, and none otherwise, and we have seen in [\eqref=tothegreatdivide] that [formula]. On the other hand, [formula], so [formula] also.

Example [\ref=wheretheoldworldshadowshang] has [formula]; some simple estimates show that this discrepancy cannot be any larger.

[formula]

Let σj  =  σ(Tj) for j = 1,2. Then, for any ε > 0, [formula] and so

[formula]

for j = 1,2 by [\eqref=andtheycamefromeverywhere]. Thus

[formula]

and therefore [formula] by [\eqref=andtheycamefromeverywhere] again.

Higher products

Even in the simplest of situations, higher products have quite subtle combinatorial and analytic properties, and for simplicity we restrict attention to the case of a map with a single orbit of each length. Similar methods will apply to maps for which the sequence [formula] is multiplicative.

Let T be a map with [formula] for [formula]. Then [formula] is equal to

[formula]

where there are m terms in the Cartesian product.

We have [formula] and fixed points for iterates simply multiply for Cartesian products so, for a prime p and [formula], by [\eqref=andtheycamefromeverywhere],

[formula]

Clearly [formula] is multiplicative, so this proves the proposition.

Proposition [\ref=seekingaplacetostand] allows the orbit Dirichlet series for higher powers to be computed (in the case [formula], with trivial changes for [formula] polynomial). To this end, assume that [formula], let [formula], write

[formula]

and define θ by

[formula]

Then

[formula]

where [formula], and m - r - 1 = b, so by rearranging

[formula]

with [formula]. Thus [formula] is given by

[formula]

where Mp(s) is (in principle) explicitly computable, and so

[formula]

By Perron's theorem [\cite=perron] we deduce that if [formula], then

[formula]

where [formula] is an explicit constant. Thus, for example, πT(N)  ~  N and [formula], while

[formula]

where

[formula]

Example [\ref=heavyintheair] with a = b = 0 gives

[formula]

and the calculation above gives

[formula]

The Euler product [formula] is suggestive, but deceptively so. Under the Hecke correspondence, the modular form with Fourier series [formula] has associated Dirichlet series

[formula]

However, there is no real connection because the choice of parameters needed violates the (known) Weil bounds that [formula] where 1 - c(p)x + p2k - 1x2  =  (1 - r1x)(1 - r2x). (Equivalently, the seeming relationship with an L-function of an elliptic curve is meaningless because the choice of parameters violates the Hasse bounds).

Natural boundaries

Natural boundaries for Dirichlet series arise in several contexts. Esterman's theorem [\cite=estermann] gives a large class of Euler products of the form

[formula]

with natural boundaries. The example below is more closely related to the work of Grunewald, du Sautoy and Woodward [\cite=MR1878998], [\cite=MR2371185] on zeta functions for subgroup growth, where products of 'ghost' polynomials are used to exhibit natural boundaries for products of the form

[formula]

Natural boundaries also arise for dynamical zeta functions in several natural dynamical settings, including certain random maps [\cite=MR1925634] and automorphisms of certain solenoids [\cite=MR2180241].

We exhibit a natural boundary for a specific case, but the appearance of a natural boundary for triple (and higher) products of systems with polynomial orbit growth is a widespread phenomena.

If [formula], then [formula] has abscissa of convergence at 3, a meromorphic extension to [formula], and a natural boundary at [formula].

By [\eqref=oraplacetohide] we know that

[formula]

where f(p- s,p) = (1 + (2p + 2)p- s + p1 - 2s). The term [formula] converges for [formula], so the abscissa of convergence is determined by the term ζ(s - 2).

To show that [formula] is a natural boundary, we show that each point s with [formula] is a limit of a sequence (sn) of zeros of [formula] with [formula]. Solving the quadratic f(x,p) = 0 for x gives the solutions

[formula]

and the zero α+p = p- s has solutions

[formula]

for [formula]. Notice that [formula] for all p, [formula] as p  →    ∞  , and by the binomial theorem [formula] for large primes p. It follows that [formula] and [formula] as p  →    ∞  . Thus given any s with [formula] we may choose a sequence (snk,pk) with the properties that

[formula];

snk,pk  →  s as k  →    ∞  ;

[formula] for all [formula].

This shows that [formula] is a natural boundary.

It remains to show that there is a meromorphic extension to the half-plane [formula], and here we follow the methods of [\cite=MR2371185]. Using the lexicographic ordering on [formula] to eliminate terms in ascending powers of x and then y, there is a unique decomposition

[formula]

with [formula], where f(x,y) = 1 + 2x + 2xy + yx2. This may be constructed using factors of the shape (1 - xayb)e to eliminate a term - exayb (e > 0) and factors of the shape (1 - x2ay2b)e(1 - xayb)- e to eliminate a term exayb (e > 0), obtaining an approximation valid to larger and larger powers of x by induction. Thus, for example, we find that

[formula]

By construction, if

[formula]

then if c(m,n) and e(m,n) are non-zero we must have [formula]. Thus for each M and [formula] the product

[formula]

converges absolutely, allowing [formula] to be defined there by

[formula]

Letting M  →    ∞   gives a meromorphic extension to [formula].
