An inhomogeneous stochastic rate process for evolution from states in an information geometric neighbourhood of uniform fitness

Introduction

Consider a population with an inhomogeneous property distribution faced with a sudden environmental change at t = 0 and let N(t) represent the declining population of more unfit individuals. In our example the distribution of unfitness a will lie in the range

[formula]

) and so conversely P0(a) is the inverse Laplace transform of the population (monotonic) decay solution [formula] See Feller [\cite=Feller] for more discussion of the existence and uniqueness properties of the correspondence between probability densities and their Laplace transforms. We see from ([\ref=Prate]) that when the unfitness a exceeds its mean Et(a) then the population density of that cohort declines and conversely the densities of cohorts with a < Et(a) tend to grow. The Shannon entropy at time t is

[formula]

which reduces to

[formula]

By using [formula] the decay rate is then

[formula]

This shows how the variance controls the entropy change during quite general inhomogeneous population processes, as we saw in [\cite=stochrateproc].

Karev gave the particular solutions for the cases of initial densities that were Poisson, gamma or uniform. In [\cite=stochrateproc] we studied the case of a bivariate gamma density for an epidemic situation. Here we shall study a family of log-gamma densities that determine a neighbourhood of the uniform distribution [\cite=InfoGeom], so recovering the solution of Karev for the uniform distribution as a special case (ν  =  τ = 1). The log-gamma family contains also close approximations to Gaussians of arbitrarily small variance truncated to

Evolution of inhomogeneity from an initial log-gamma probability density

We studied in [\cite=InfoGeom] the smooth family of log-gamma distributions and their information geometry. This family has probability density function

[formula]

for random variable a∈[0,1] and parameters ν,τ > 0. The mean and variance, Figure [\ref=LogGamMVar], are given by

[formula]

The locus in this family of those with central mean [formula] satisfies

[formula]

and some are shown in Figure [\ref=LGF] The uniform density is the special case with τ  =  ν = 1 and this can be seen in Figure [\ref=sections], with sections through the surface of Figure [\ref=LGF]. The log-gamma family yields a smooth Riemannian 2-manifold with coordinates [formula] and metric tensor given by

[formula]

In fact, this manifold is an isometric diffeomorph of the 2-manifold of gamma densities, with random variable x =  -  log a via natural coordinates (ν,τ) (cf. [\cite=AN]) for which τ = 1 corresponds to the subfamily of exponential densities. Through this smooth diffeomorphism we can therefore represent the manifold of log-gamma densities as a natural affine immersion (cf. [\cite=InfoGeom]) of [formula] in [formula]

[formula]

This is illustrated in Figure [\ref=SphNhd] which shows also a spherical neighbourhood in [formula] centred on the point at the uniform density, ν = 1 = τ; the other two points are for the two cases (ν = 0.1,τ = 0.289) and (ν = 2.75,τ = 2.24) which represent densities also having mean value [formula] and used in the sequel as initial unfitness distributions, cf. Figures [\ref=EtaDec],[\ref=L0Dec],[\ref=VtaDec].

The log-gamma entropy ([\ref=Sdef]) is given by

[formula]

Figure [\ref=LogGamEntSurfCont] shows the graph as a surface and as a contour plot with gradient vector field indicated; the main curvature occurs near the origin.

The Laplace transform integral ([\ref=L0]) for the log-gamma density with general (ν,τ) seems intractable so we used a series development up to sixth order for the term e- at, bearing in mind that a∈[0,1]. Thus, up to sixth order in t  ≥  0 we obtain a good approximation to L0(t), accurate to about 0.1% up to t = 1. The corresponding expressions for L0(t), Pt(a), Et(a), σ2t(a) and hence N(t) are known but somewhat cumbersome to present here so we present some graphics for illustration. The decline of the mean Et(a) as the density Pt(a) develops from three initial log-gamma densities P0(a) with central mean, [formula] is shown in Figure [\ref=EtaDec]. The more rapid decline occurs for the initial density with τ = 0.289 and the slower decline occurs for the case having τ  =  2.24 with the uniform case τ  =  ν = 1 in between, cf. also Figure [\ref=SphNhd]. The corresponding decline of N(t) / N(0) = L0(t) is shown in Figure [\ref=L0Dec] and the variance is shown in Figure [\ref=VtaDec].

We do have an analytic solution for the special 1-parameter family of log-gamma densities with τ = 1 (the log-exponential' densities), from ([\ref=L0]) and ([\ref=Pt]):

[formula]

where Γ(ν,t) is the incomplete gamma function. Et(a,ν,1), declines for all choices of parameter ν in the initial density, which includes of course also the uniform density. Further analytic solutions arise for other initial log-gamma densities with positive integer τ (the log-Pearson Type III' distributions) cf. Figure [\ref=sections], as generalized hypergeomentric functions; for example,

[formula]

Discussion

These new results show how evolution of an inhomogeneous rate process reacts to perturbations of the uniform density using the smooth two parameter (ν,τ) family of log-gamma probability density functions [\cite=InfoGeom] to represent unfitness measured by parameter a∈[0,1]. We have illustrated the evolution from three initial states having central mean [formula] but different variances (cf. Figures [\ref=sections] and [\ref=SphNhd]):

The graphs of these three starting log-gamma densities in the left hand sides of Figures [\ref=EtaDec],[\ref=L0Dec],[\ref=VtaDec] show widely differing shapes; the higher variance arises from peaks at the extremities of unfitness and the lower variance case has a symmetric bell-like curve about the mean. The evolution of features from the initial uniform density from Karev [\cite=Karev03] is--cf. equation ([\ref=Pt]) above,

[formula]

To this we add our analytic results ([\ref=Ptnu]), ([\ref=Etnu]) for the initial log-gamma cases with τ = 1, which agrees with ([\ref=K0]) at ν = 1 and the generalized hypergeometric solutions ([\ref=t2]), ([\ref=t3]) along with corresponding versions for integer τ > 3. Our series approximation agrees with the analytic results for the early development. Figure [\ref=EtaDec] shows that in each of our cases the evolution of mean unfitness Et(a) does indeed follow the expected equation ([\ref=Vta]), which expresses Fisher's law of natural selection [\cite=Fisher]. Also, in Figure [\ref=VtaDec] the very slow early evolution of its variance σ2t(a) reflects the corresponding lack of curvature in the mean. In fact, though the decline of the mean fitness does change with the variation in starting conditions, the net population evolution N(t) in Figure [\ref=L0Dec] seems surprisingly stable under quite considerable alterations in the shape and variance of the initial density of inhomogeneity in fitness. The rate process evidently has a strong smoothing effect when we begin from a central mean, even though the variances differ widely.

We can however obtain considerable changes in the evolution if we depart from an initial central mean. We illustrate this using our analytic solutions to allow evolution over longer periods. For example, the initial log-gamma density for τ = 1, equations ([\ref=Ptnu]),([\ref=Etnu]),([\ref=Ntnu]), gives the examples shown in Figure [\ref=NTau1Dec]. Here we see the effect of ν which acts as a location parameter for the initial density. Figure [\ref=Ptnu1] shows the evolution of the initial case with ν = 10 into the probability densities Pt(a,10,1) from ([\ref=Ptnu]).

Also, the initial unimodular log-gamma probability densities for τ = 7, Pt(a,ν,7), give this generalized hypergeometric solution

[formula]

and again ν serves as a location parameter. Figure [\ref=NTau7Dec] illustrates cases for ν = 3, 10, 50 as well as that for an initial uniform density.

Our approach has considered the determinate rate process for the evolution of individual types with an inhomogeneous fitness distribution; Baake and Georgii [\cite=Baake] consider the multi-dimensional systems of many types. Their mutation and differential reproduction processes yield n-dimensional systems of differential equations which they analyse using variational methods.
