Can the excess in the FeXXVI Lyγ line from the Galactic Center provide evidence for 17 keV sterile neutrinos?

Introduction

Several astrophysical observations, such as the indications of central cores in low-mass galaxies, the low number of satellites observed around the Milky Way, and the near constant cores of the least luminous satellites, have revived interest in sterile neutrinos as a warm dark matter candidate. Electroweak singlet right-handed (sterile) neutrinos with masses in the few keV range naturally arise in many extensions of the Standard Model and could be produced in the early universe through the Dodelson-Widrow mechanism involving (non-resonant) oscillations with active neutrino species [\cite=Dodelson_1994]. The experimentally established phenomenon of neutrino oscillations requires neutrinos to have non-zero mass, and sterile neutrinos (or right-handed neutrinos) are a natural warm dark matter candidate.

Direct constraints on masses and mixing angles are obtained both from the Lyman alpha forest power spectrum and X-ray observations of the radiative decay channel, the latter providing a photon with energy E=[formula], where [formula] is the sterile neutrino mass. Most recently, X-ray observations of the local dwarf Wilman 1 have shown marginal evidence for a 5 keV sterile neutrino [\cite=Loewenstein_2009]. The inferred mixing angle lies in a narrow range for which neutrino oscillations can produce all of the dark matter and for which sterile neutrino emission from cooling neutron stars can explain pulsar kicks.

In fact if sterile neutrinos provide a significant fraction (although not necessarily all, see [\cite=Palazzo_2007],) of the dark matter, the Galactic Center provides an even more attractive environment to search for radiative decay signals. If the sterile neutrino mass is indeed around 17 keV, we expect a X-ray line near 8.5 keV. The diffuse X-ray emission from the Galactic Center using the X-ray imaging spectrometer on Suzaku was analyzed by [\cite=Koyama_2007], who detect the 8.7 keV line corresponding the FeXXVI Lyγ. We have reanalysed the data on hydrogen-like iron line strengths and find that there is an unexpected excess in the 8.7 keV line from the Galactic center in the Suzaku data. We demonstrate that this excess cannot be explained by means of standard ionization and recombination processes. We propose an explanation of the excess in the 8.7 keV line in terms of 17.4 keV neutrino decays.

The excess in the 8.7 keV line from the Galactic center and its origin

X-ray emission from the Galactic center has been observed for almost 30 years. A component of the diffuse emission is thermal and is produced by a high temperature plasma in the inner 20 parsecs of the Galactic Center (~   8 keV). The most pronounced features in the emission lines are Fe I Kα at 6.4 keV, and the K-shell lines 6.7 and 6.9 keV from the helium-like (FeXXV Kα) and hydrogen-like (FeXXVI Lyα) ions of iron, respectively. An analysis of the ratio of the 6.7 keV to 6.9 keV lines is an interesting test of plasma components (see, e.g. [\cite=Dogiel_2009], [\cite=Prokhorov_2009]). For the first time, the FeXXVI Lyγ at 8.7 keV was detected by the Suzaku X-ray mission [\cite=Koyama_2007]. The observed line intensities by Suzaku are listed in Table 2 of [\cite=Koyama_2007]. For convenience, we list below the most important lines (for our analysis) taken from the paper by [\cite=Koyama_2007]. The measured intensities of the lines of the hydrogen-like iron ions are: [formula] ph/(cm2 s), [formula] ph/(cm2 s), and [formula] ph/(cm2 s). The errors are at 90% confidence level [\cite=Koyama_2007].

The measured ratio of the FeXXVI Lyβ to FeXXVI Lyα iron lines equals ≈  0.138  ±  0.059 and is in agreement with the theoretical value of ≈  0.14 in the gas temperature range between 5 and 15 keV (see line list [\cite=linelist]; for a review, see [\cite=Mewe_1981]).

We note that the measured intensity of the FeXXVI Lyγ = 1.77+ 0.62- 0.56  ×  10- 5 ph/(cm2 s) iron line has an significant excess above the value derived from the theoretical model [\cite=linelist] and the measured intensity [formula] of the FeXXVI Lyα iron line. The ratio of the the FeXXVI Lyγ to FeXXVI Lyα iron lines equaled 0.038 in the gas temperature range between 5 and 15 keV is from the theoretical model (see, [\cite=linelist]). Therefore the expected value of the intensity in the FeXXVI Lyγ line is [formula] ph/(cm2 s) and is much smaller than the measured intensity by Suzaku. Therefore, the excess of the intensity in the 8.7 keV line equals [formula] ph/(cm2 s).

To demonstrate that this excess cannot be explained by ionization and recombination processes, we calculate the ratio of the fully stripped (FeXXVII) ionic fraction to the hydrogen-like iron ionic fraction using the ratio of the intensities of the FeXXVI Lyγ to Lyα lines as a function of temperature T.

The ratio rγα of the FeXXVI Lyγ to FeXXVI Lyα iron line intensities is given by

[formula]

where Eγ and Eα are the impact excitation rate coefficients, and Rγ and Rα are the rate coefficients for the contribution from recombination to the Lyγ and Lyα spectral lines, respectively. Excitation and recombination rate coefficients are taken from [\cite=Mewe_1981].

From Eq. ([\ref=r]) the ratio of the fully stripped (FeXXVII) ionic fraction to the hydrogen-like iron ionic fraction is

[formula]

Note that we do not use the assumption of collisional ionization equilibrium.

For the best fit value of the intensity ratio of the Lyγ to Lyα iron lines ([formula]) found by [\cite=Koyama_2007], we find that the ratio of the fully stripped (FeXXVII) ion fraction to the hydrogen-like iron ion fraction lies in the range ( - 40, - 20) when the electron temperature is in the range (5 keV, 15 keV). Since the ratio of the fully stripped (FeXXVII) to hydrogen-like (FeXXVI) ion fractions should not be negative, we conclude that the excess cannot be explained by ionization and recombination processes. A more physically acceptable explanation of the excess is that of sterile neutrino decays, under the assumption that sterile neutrinos constitute a significant fraction of dark matter. In the next section, we calculate the mixing angle using our inferred value of the intensity excess in the 8.7 keV line.

Radiative decays of sterile neutrinos

The sterile neutrino possesses a radiative decay channel decaying to an active neutrino and a photon with energy [formula]. Since the excess in the 8.7 keV line corresponds to a sterile neutrino mass of 17.4 keV, in this section we estimate the mixing angle sin 2(2θ) and decay rate for such a sterile neutrino.

Using the excess in the 8.7 keV line intensity equal to [formula] and the definition of the energy flux [formula], we find that the value of the energy flux excess in the 8.7 keV line equals [formula].

Decays of sterile neutrinos in the dark matter halo of the Milky Way are a promising way to explain the excess in the 8.7 keV line. The amount dark matter within the field of view of the Suzaku observation (see Fig. 1 of [\cite=Koyama_2007]) is only a minute fraction of the total mass of the dark matter halo of the Milky Way. We consider the model of the Milky Way dark halo presented in [\cite=Klypin_2002] and used to derive constraints on the sterile neutrino parameters by [\cite=Boyarsky_2006]. The Milky Way halo density is described by the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile

[formula]

where the dark matter halo parameters of preferred models obtained in [\cite=Klypin_2002] correspond to [formula], [formula] kpc and numerical constant [formula] (see [\cite=Boyarsky_2006]). A mass within the field of view of [formula] is derived from this model.

The decay flux into a solid angle Ω (within the field of view) is given by (see, e. g. [\cite=Boyarsky_2008])

[formula]

where [formula] kpc is the distance to the Galactic center. The decay rate Γ is given by (e.g. [\cite=Boyarsky_2008] and references therein)

[formula]

To estimate the value of the mixing angle, we use the inferred value of [formula] and the value of the energy flux excess. Then, from Eqs. (4), (5) the value of the mixing angle is given by

[formula]

Using Eq. (5) we derive the following constraint on the decay rate:

[formula]

Note that the derived values of the mixing angle of [formula] and decay rate of [formula] lie in the allowed region for a dark matter sterile neutrino with a mass of 17-18 keV (see [\cite=den_Herder_2009]). Such a neutrino is capable of accounting for a substantial fraction, if not all, of the dark matter.

An additional contribution of comparable strength comes in a point-like source if a cusp of dark matter develops around the centar black hole. The dark matter cusp mass is constrained observationally by stellar orbit measurements and is taken to be [formula] within the central 0.001 pc. This is comparable to the mass of the central black hole. Such a cusp is naturally produced via adiabatic contraction of dark matter around the black hole within its sphere of influence, about 3 pc for the Milky Way black hole [\cite=Gondolo_1999], [\cite=Zhao_2005]. Typically about as much mass is captured in the spike as is in the central black hole and with a density profile of [formula] or even steeper. Dynamical histories of merging complicate this picture. In particular, binary black hole mergers, had they occurred, would destroy such a spike (see [\cite=Ullio_2001], [\cite=Merritt_2002], [\cite=Bertone_2005]).

However an alternative and more conservative scenario is cusp regeneration. This cannot occur directly in the dark matter because its relaxation time is extremely long. However, this is not the case for the central stars, and once a cusp forms in the stars, scattering of dark matter particles off of stars can redistribute the dark matter in phase space on a time scale of order the relatively short star-star relaxation time [\cite=Merritt_2004], resulting in a [formula] density cusp in the central parsec of the dark matter [\cite=Merritt_2007].

Sterile neutrinos would form such a dark matter cusp, although the spike density is limited by phase space considerations for non-degenerate neutrinos (see, [\cite=Tremaine_1979]). Using the values of the velocity dispersion for the Milky Way of 100 km/s [\cite=Merritt_2001] and a sterile neutrino mass of 17.4 keV, we find a limit on the density [formula]. This would guarantee a point-like source if there is indeed a cusp.

Conclusions

We have found that there is an excess in the intensity in the 8.7 keV line observed from the Galactic center over the theoretical value expected for the intensity in the FeXXVI Lyγ line. This intensity excess equals [formula] ph/(cm2 s), where the errors are at the 90% confidence level. We show that this excess cannot be explained by means of standard ionization and recombination processes, since the ratio of the fully stripped (FeXXVII) to FeXXVI ion fractions becomes (unphysically) negative in the temperature range of (5 keV, 15 keV), when the observed ratio of FeXXVI Lyγ to FeXXVI Lyα iron lines is applied.

We suggest that a physically acceptable explanation of the intensity excess in the 8.7 keV line is due to decays of sterile neutrinos that that are in a halo of dark matter around the Milky Way. The dark matter density profile we adopt is obtained by numerical simulations [\cite=Klypin_2002]. The dark matter mass from the Milky Way dark matter halo within the field of view of the Suzaku observation is small compared with the total mass of the dark halo [formula], however it suffices [formula] to produce a significant flux [formula] ph/(cm2 s) via decays of sterile neutrinos.

Nearby low surface brightness dwarf galaxies have a central dark matter density as high as [formula] and are consistent with a common mass scale of [formula] [\cite=Strigari_2008] and even a universal dark matter profile with a limiting central dark matter surface density of log(r0ρ0)  =  2.15  ±  0.2, in units of [formula] [\cite=Walker_2009]. The corresponding density is well within the phase space constraints for 17 keV sterile neutrinos.

One explanation of the common mass scale is that dark matter haloes do not exist at lower masses. Warm dark matter particles have large enough free streaming lengths to erase all density fluctuations that might have formed lower mass halos if the mass of the warm dark matter particle is approximately 5 keV for a minimum halo mass of [formula]. In the present case, the mass of such sterile neutrinos is [formula] keV. The minimum halo mass scale is approximately [formula]. Note that the actual dwarf masses could extend to lower values than evaluated at the 300 pc scale by [\cite=Strigari_2008].

We estimated the mixing angle of [formula] from the excess in the intensity and the decay rate is found to be decay rate: [formula] These values lie in the allowed region of the mixing angle and decay rate parameter space for a dark matter sterile neutrino with a mass of 17-18 keV (see [\cite=den_Herder_2009]). Sterile neutrinos in this region of mass, decay rate and mixing angle parameter space can contribute significantly to dark matter. Such neutrinos would be virtually indistinguishable from cold dark matter except in the lowest mass dwarf galaxies where cores would be formed. High resolution x-ray observations should reveal a point-like line source of comparable strength to the Suzaku line excess if a cusp is present around the central black hole.
