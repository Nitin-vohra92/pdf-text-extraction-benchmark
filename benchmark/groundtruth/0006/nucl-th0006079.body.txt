ABSTRACT: Employing hamiltonians defined by two-body embedded Gaussian orthogonal ensemble of random matrices(EGOE(2)) plus a mean-field producing one-body part, strength functions (for states defined by the one-body part) are constructed for various values of the strength of the chaos generating two-body part. Numerical calculations for six and seven fermion systems clearly demonstrate Breit-Wigner to Gaussian transition, in the chaotic domain, in strength functions as found earlier in nuclear shell model and Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model calculations.

Strength functions (also called local density of states (LDOS) in literature) of simple modes are basic ingredients of many particle systems such as atomic nuclei [\cite=Bo-69]. In the last few years, with developments in quantum chaos [\cite=Gu-98], nature of strength functions for finite isolated interacting many particle systems are being investigated using a variety of models: (i) Zelevinsky et al using nuclear shell model [\cite=Ze-96]; (ii) Wang et al using the three-orbital Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model [\cite=Wa-98]; (iii) Borgonovi et al using a symmetrized coupled two-rotor model [\cite=Bo-98]; (iv) Benet et al using a chaotic model of two coupled quartic oscillators [\cite=Se-00]. Results from the shell model and Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model studies clearly showed that strength functions exhibit, for interacting particle systems, Breit-Wigner to Gaussian transition. Moreover it is seen that the transition takes place much after the onset of chaos in energy levels (i.e. much after level fluctuations start following GOE). In order to establish that this transition is generic to interacting particle systems, we carried out one plus two-body embedded Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (EGOE(1+2)) calculations and the results are reported in this short communication (see also [\cite=Fl-97] [\cite=Ko-00]).

Given a compound state φk, the probability of its decay into stationary states ψE (generated by H) is given by [formula]. Then the strength function Fk(E) is,

[formula]

The standard form [\cite=Bo-69], normally employed in many applications in nuclear physics, for strength functions is the Breit-Wigner (BW) form characterized by a spreading width Γk,

[formula]

where [formula]. Starting with H = h(1)  +  λV(2) (a one plus two-body interaction as in the shell model) with h(1) defining the φk states, it is easily seen that the assumptions that give Fk:BW(E) will break down when the mixing is strong. Thus it is expected that the form of Fk(E) will be different from BW for large λ. In order to find the form of strength functions in large λ limit, it is useful to think of φk as a compound state generated by the action of a transition operator O on a state ψEk (for example ground state),

[formula]

The numerator in the expression for Fk(E) in (3) is nothing but the bivariate strength density generated by the operator O [\cite=Fr-88] and then it is easy to recognize that Fk(E) is the conditional density of this bivariate strength density. It is known [\cite=Fr-88] that EGOE(k), the embedded GOE of k-body interactions (see Ref. [\cite=Br-81] for the definition of EGOE(k)), in general gives bivariate Gaussian strength densities. Therefore, for EGOE(2), which models a generic two-body hamiltonian, the strength functions take Gaussian form (conditional density of a bivariate Gaussian is a Gaussian). However, for generic interacting particle systems, it is more appropriate to consider one plus two-body EGOE(1+2) hamiltonians {H} = h(1)  +  λ{V(2)} where h(1) is the one-body mean-field producing part and {V(2)} is the chaos generating two-body part; note that {V(2)} is GOE in two-particle space with unit matrix elements variance and λ is the interaction strength. Starting with EGOE(1+2) it is to be expected that for sufficiently large values of λ, EGOE(2) description should be valid and therefore (3) gives the shape of the strength function to be Gaussian for large λ; this result is indeed seen in numerical calculations. Now the important questions are: (i) how Fk(E) changes as λ is varied and (ii) from which value of λ strength functions take Gaussian form.

For further understanding of the nature of Fk(E), we performed EGOE(1+2) calculations in 924 dimensional space generated by six fermions (m = 6) in twelve single particle states (N = 12) and similarly in the 3432 dimensional N = 14 and m = 7 space. The single particle energies employed are εi = i + (1 / i), [formula] as in [\cite=Fl-96]. For various values of λ in h(1) + λ{V(2)}, strength functions are constructed by choosing the φk states to be the mean-field h(1) states defined by the distribution of m particles in the N single particle states; their energies Ek are [formula]. In the calculations E and Ek are zero centered for each member and scaled by the spectrum (E's) width σ; Êk  =  (Ek  -  ε) / σ and Ê  =  (E - ε) / σ. For each member |CEk|2 are summed over the basis states [formula] in the energy window Êk  ±  Δ and then ensemble averaged FÊk(Ê) vs Ê is constructed as a histogram; the value of Δ is chosen to be 0.025 for λ  ≤  0.1 and beyond this Δ = 0.1. Results for Êk = 0 are shown for λ  =   0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.5 in Fig. 1; in the plots [formula]. From the figures it is clearly seen that there is BW to Gaussian transition in Fk(E). A measure for this transition is,

[formula]

In (4) Ei are defined by the center of each bin in the histogram representing F(λ)k(E) and ED corresponds to Gaussian with Edgeworth corrections; the ED incorporates [\cite=Ke-69] skewness (γ1) and excess (γ2) corrections. Strength function F(λ)k(E) is BW for R = 0 and Gaussian (or ED) for R = 1. The value of the interpolating parameter λ  =  λFk for onset of the transition from BW to Gaussian is taken to be R(λFk) = 0.7. For λ  =   0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5 the values of R are 0.13, 0.06, 0.21, 0.7, 0.9, 1.03 for the six particle example. For the seven particle example the corresponding numbers are 0.15, 0.02, 0.45, 0.75, 0.93, 1.03 respectively. Thus, with the measure R in (4), λFk  ≈  0.2 for both the 6 and 7 particle cases.

In Fig. 2 shown are EGOE(1+2) results for various values of λ for the nearest neighbour spacing dustribution and [formula], 0  ≤  L  ≤  40 statistic. The λFk deduced from the results in Fig. 1 should be compared with λ  =  λc  ~  0.08 and 0.06, derived via Fig. 2, for six and seven particle examples repectively for onset of chaos in level fluctuations. The λc numbers are consistant with (Nm2)- 1 variation as expected from the theory given in [\cite=Ja-97]. It should be noted that in the (2s,1d)m = 12,JπT = 0+0 shell model example considered in [\cite=Ze-96], λc  ~  0.3 and λFk  ~  0.6. Thus the BW form for Fk(E), which begins some what before λ approches λc (for λ <  < λc the strength functions are delta functions with perturbative corrections), extends much into the chaotic domain (defined by λ  >  λc) and the transition to Gaussian shape takes place in the second layer defined by λFk (λFk >  > λc). As the λFk in our two examples did not show much variation with (N,m), it appears that λFk will have weak dependence on m unlike λc. Perhaps for sufficiently large m, the transition to Gaussian form takes place in the thermalization regime discussed by Flambaum and Izrailev [\cite=Fl-97] (see also [\cite=Ho-95]). It should be remarked that EGOE(2) gives Gaussian form for state densities for sufficiently large m and its extension to partial state densities (which are sums of strength functions) is indeed the basis of statistical nuclear spectrocopy [\cite=Fr-88] [\cite=Fr-82].

In conclusion, the results of the present EGOE(1+2) study (Figs. 1,2) and the earlier shell model [\cite=Ze-96] and Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model [\cite=Wa-98] analysis establish firmly the Breit-Wigner to Gaussian transition for strength functions, in the chaotic domain, in interacting particle systems such as atomic nuclei.
