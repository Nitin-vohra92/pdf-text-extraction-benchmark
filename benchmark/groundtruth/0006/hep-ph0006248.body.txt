On Geometric Engineering of Supersymmetric Gauge Theories

High Energy Physics Laboratory, Faculty of sciences , Rabat , Morocco

Introduction

Over the few past years we have learned how many non trivial supersymmetric QFT are obtained from singular limits of type II strings, M-theory and F-theory compactifications by using the geometric engineering method introduced [\cite=KKV] and developped by Kazt, Mayr and Vafa in [\cite=KMV], see also [\cite={BFS}] [\cite={BFaS}] [\cite={BS}]. The basic tools of this tricky method are toric geometry of ADE singularities of the K3 surface and local mirror symmetry. In this method, the complex and Kahler deformation parameters of the singularities are related to physical parameters in the low energy limit of string compactifications. The most familiar example is type IIA string on K3 near ADE singularities, which believed to be dual to heterotic string on T4. In this case the low energy limit is described by supersymmetric theories in six dimensions with ADE gauge groups. The moduli space of gauge invariant vacua of these models is just the moduli space of K3, which may be viewed as the moduli space of wrapped D2 branes on two cycles of K3. In this communication we focus our attention on the study of type II superstrings compactification on ADE hypersurface singularities. In particular we study the embedding of 4D supersymmetric QFT in type IIA string compactification on Calabi Yau threefolds near the ADE singularities. We also discuss the geometric engineering of the interesting case of N = 1 supersymmetric gauge theories, obtained from F-theory on singular elliptic Calabi Yau manifolds [\cite=BS].

Toric geometry and Calabi Yau singularities

Here we review briefly some basic facts about toric geometry useful for the study of superstring compactifications [\cite=LV]. Roughly speaking, toric geometry concerns n complex dimensional manifolds which can be represented by a polytope Δ of the n dimensional Zn hypercubic lattice of Rn. Instead of using direct complex analysis methods for complex manifolds, it is interesting to apply technics of toric geometry. Toric geometry is a valuabe tool for the discussion of geometric properties of Calabi Yau manifolds which are important in the context of string compatifications and Calabi Yau fiber bundles involved in F-theory - heterotic strings duality. Simple example of toric varieties are given by weighted projective spaces (WCPn). These spaces can be defined as

[formula]

with the C *  action

[formula]

The leading CP1 example parametrized by {(x1,x2) / (x1,x2) = (λx1,λx2),λ∈C * } is just the complex line which is know to be isomorphism to the real two sphere S2  ≈  SU(2) / U(1). A less trivial example is given by WCP2(2,3,1). In this case, the equivalence relation (2.2) becomes

[formula]

This relation can be encoded in triangle in R2, with the following three vertices vx1 = ( - 1,0), vx2 = (0, - 1) and vx3 = (2,3) in Z2, such that

[formula]

where the coefficients of vxi are the powers of λ in eq (2.3). More general d-dimensional toric manifolds are generalizations of these weighted projective spaces which are defined as

[formula]

where the U set and the C* action are given by:

[formula]

[formula]

The toric manifold (2.5) extend the complex projective spaces WCPn in the sense that instead of removing the origin, one removes the set U and takes the quotient by the C* actions. D-dimensional toric manifolds VdΔ have many remarkable properties one of them is that they may be encoded in toric diagram Δ of k = d + r vertices vi embedded in the Zd lattice such that

[formula]

In these eqs (2.8), the qai's are the Mori vectors defining the intersection matrix of divisors of toric manifolds VdΔ. Note in passing that toric geometry is intimately related to 2d N = 2 supersymmetric sigma models. In the case where the target space is VdΔ , then the charges qai are interpreted as the charges of the matter fields (xi), and eqs (2.8) is linked to the D- flatness eqs of 2d N = 2 gauge theory describing the flat direction as shown here below

[formula]

In this eqs Ra's are the Fayet Iliopoulos (FI) coupling parameters which describe Kahler parameters of toric manifolds. Note also that the first chern class of these spaces is proportional to [formula] [\cite=HV]. For [formula], the VdΔ become Calabi Yau manifolds. This means physically that the N = 2 supersymmetric theories flow to N = 2 SCFT [\cite={HV}] [\cite={HIV}]. Another important tool of toric geometry is mirror symmetry. The latter is a symmetry which transforms into each other Kahler and complex structres of complex d- dimensional Calabi Yau manifolds M and W. A mirror pair has Hodge numbers satisfying the mirror relations.

[formula]

this means that the complex moduli space of M is identical to the Kahler moduli space of W and vice versa. Mirror symmetry plays a central role in the study of type II superstring compatifications and in the determination of the moduli space of vacua. This transformation can be viewed as a generalization of T-duality in type II strings compactification on Calabi Yau manifold [\cite=LV]. It would be interesting to note that the mirror symmetry has played a crucial role in the developement in superstrings and QFT dualities and in the obtention of exact results. For example, l'absence of type IIA dilaton in the vector multiplet, has been exploited to derive exact solution in the Coulomb branch of N = 2 QFT in four dimensions by using mirror symmetry.

ADE hypersurfaces

Toric varieties may have singularites, which are very important in the understanding the non perturbative solutions of gauge theories. Some of these singularities, which have toric realizations, are given by the so called ADE singularites:

[formula]

These equations describe complex surfaces embedded in C3 with coordinates x,y,z. Each of them has a singularity at x = y = z = 0. ADE singularities may be resolved either by deforming the complex structure or the Kahler one to obtain a smooth manifold. Kahler deformation consists to blow up the singular point by intersecting 2-spheres ranged according to the Dynkin diagram of ADE Lie algebras. The intersection matrices of the blowing up 2-spheres C2 , of the resolution of the ADE singularities, are given by the Mori vectors qai (eq ( 2.4-5)) , which up to sign, coincides with the Cartan matrices Kij of the ADE Lie algebras. This nice connection between singularities and Lie algebras plays an important role in the geometric engineering of the N = 2 supersymmetric quantum field theory in four dimensions obtained from type II strings compatification on local Calabi Yau threefolds [\cite=KMV], and in the geometric engineering of N = 1 models from F-theory compactification on elliptic Calabi Yau manifolds [\cite=BS].

Geometric engineering of N = 2 QFT in four dimensions

Geomeetric engineering of 4D N = 2 supersymmetric quantum field theories is a geometrical method allowing to get the relevent moduli from type IIA string compactification on local Calabi Yau threefold M3 with ADE singularites. In this method M3 is realized as a local K3 ( ALE space) fibered over a base which may be thought of as a 2-sphere or a collection of intersecting 2-spheres. The gauge fields of the QFT is obtained from D2 branes wrapped on the 2 cycles of the singularities of the fiber K3 and the matters are given by non trivial geometry on the base of M3. The physical parameters of the field theory are related to the moduli space of both the fiber (F) and the base (B) of M3. The gauge coupling g is proportional to the inverse of the square root of the volume of the base V(B), i.e

[formula]

Before giving the main steps in getting 4DN = 2 from IIA string on M3. Let us begin by describing type IIA compactification on local K3 with ADE singularities.

N = 2 in six dimensions

Type IIA on K3 near ADE singularities give a 6D N = 2 supersymmetric gauge theory with ADE gauge symmetries. To fix the ideas suppose for simplicity that K3 has a su(2) singularity. The local geometry of this background is described by the complex equation:

[formula]

Type IIA on K3 with su(2) singularity gives a N = 2 SU(2) gauge theory in six dimensions. In this case D2-branes wrapping around the blow down 2-sphere give two W±μ massless vector particles depending of the two possible orientations for the wrapping. The W±μ gauge fields are charged under the U(1) gauge boson Zμ0 obtained by decomposing the type IIA superstring 3-form in terms of the harmonic forms of the vanishing 2-sphere . Then near an A1 singularity of K3, we get three massless vector particles W±μ and Zμ0 which altogether form an SU(2) adjoint. We thus obtain a N = 2 SU(2) gauge theory in 6 dimensions. More genererally, if the single vanishing 2-sphere is replaced by a collection of intersectiong 2-sphere according to the ADE Dynkin Diagrams, one get a 6D N = 2 sypersymmetric gauge theory with ADE gauge groups.

N = 2 in four dimensions

To obtain QFT's in four dimensions, one has to consider a further compactification on a one complex dimensional base of M3. If the (B) is a single 2-sphere, then one gets a N = 2 pure SU(2) Yang -Mills in 4 dimensions. To incorporate matter, we consider non trivial geometry on the base of M3. If we have a 2 dimensional locus with SU(n) singularity and another locus with SU(m) singularity and they meet to a point, the mixed wrapped 2-cycles will now lead to (n,m) N = 2 bi-fundamental matter of the SU(n)  ×  SU(m) gauge symmetry in four dimensions. Geometrically, this means that the base geometry of M3 is given by two intersecting P1 2-spheres whose volumes V1 and V2 define the gauge coupling constant g1 and g2 of the SU(n) and SU(m) symmetries respectively. Note that we can also engineer the adjoint matter. Moreover if we choose the base (B) as a collection of intersecting 2-spheres according to affine Dynkin diagrams, then one engineers N = 2 superconformal field theories in four dimensions. Geometric engineering of 4D N = 2 QFT is really a tricky method to study 4D N = 2 QFT embedded in type IIA superstring theory. In this method, 4DN = 2 QFT's are represented by quiver diagrams where for each SU gauge group factor we consider a node, and for each pair of groups with bi-fundamental matter, we connect the corresponding nodes with a line. These diagrams have a similar representation as the ADE Dynkin diagrams of ordinary and affine simply laced Lie algebras. The developments obtained over the few last years are nicely described in this approach. In this regards, it is worthwhile to mention the three following due to this construction : (i) The derivation of exact solutions of Coulomb branch of 4D N = 2 QFT which are obtained by help of local mirror symmetry. (ii) The classification of 4D N = 2 superconformal theories in terms of affine ADE diagrams. This analysis is also valid in the non simply laced cases [\cite=BFaS] (iii) The gauge coupling space of these superconformal field theories is linked to the moduli of flat connections on the torus. These moduli is interseting in the study of the duality bettween heterotic string on elliptically fibered compact manifolds and F-theory, and in geometric construction of N = 1 vacua .

Conclusion and Discussion

We conclude this communication by discussing the geometric construction of N = 1 Yang - Mills in four dimensions. These models may be obtained in terms of F-theory on elliptic Calabi You fourfold. The latter is realized as elliptically fibered K3, with affine ADE singularities, fiber over a complex base space. If we choose the base a P2, or two complex dimensional toric spaces Fn , this gives N = 1 Yang Mills in four dimensions with ADE gauge symmetries. Morevover we can also engineer N = 1 models with non simply laced gauge symmetries by using the analysis of [\cite=BS]. This analysis is based on toric realization of folding method of ADE Lie algebras. In that our work we have distinguich two possible toric realizations depending on the action of the folding on the elliptic curve of the fiber K3. In this work we have studied the geometric engineering of supersymmetric gauge theories obtained as a low energy limit of type II strings on Calabi Yau manifolds with ADE singularities in the fiber K3. It turns out that ADE singularities of K3 lead to appearance of corresponding gauge group in physics. Moreover these singularities have toric realizations, which are related to Kahler Calabi Yau construction from 2D N = 2 sigma models. Thus it is natural to think about another type of singularities and their gauge theories corresponding, such as hyperkahler singularities which are linked to 2d N = 4 sigma models approach [\cite={BH}] [\cite={BSa}]. These singularities maight be used to derive new physics, not described by a conventional gauge theory.
