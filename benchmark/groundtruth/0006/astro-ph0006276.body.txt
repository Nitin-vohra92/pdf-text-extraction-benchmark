Abstract

The widely cited formula [formula] for the multipole number of the first Doppler peak is not even a crude approximation in the case of greatest current interest, in which the cosmic mass density is less than the vacuum energy density. For instance, with ΩM fixed at 0.3, the position of any Doppler peak varies as Ω- 1.580 near Ω0 = 1.

The precise measurement1 of the multipole number [formula] at the first 'Doppler' peak has provided an invaluable constraint on cosmological parameters. In a 1994 numerical calculation, Kamionkowski, Spergel and Sugiyama2 presented a formula giving [formula] as a function essentially of the curvature alone:

[formula]

where [formula], in which ΩM and ΩΛ are the present ratios of the cosmic mass density and the vacuum energy (associated, e. g., with a cosmological constant) to the critical density. This calculation was done before supernova studies3 indicated the likely presence of a relatively large cosmological constant, and therefore assumed that ΩΛ = 0. They also explained the Ω-  1 / 20 behavior by noting that [formula] is approximately inversely proportional to the angle subtended at the earth by the horizon at the time of last scattering, which was known4 to be proportional to Ω1 / 20 for ΩΛ = 0. The same Ω0-dependence was derived on the same grounds by Frampton et al.,5 explicitly for the case ΩΛ = 0.

Unfortunately, despite the fact that it was derived only for the case ΩΛ = 0, Eq. (1) continues to be quoted1,6,7,8,9 as if it were generally applicable also when ΩΛ is appreciable. As far as I know, this formula has not been used by observational groups in analysis of their data, but in view of the great current interest in these matters, it seems worth warning that in fact, Eq. (1) is not valid for parameters in the range suggested by supernova observations, for which ΩΛ  >  ΩM. Although it is true that when Ω0 is near unity, [formula] depends less sensitively on other parameters than on Ω0, the dependence of [formula] on Ω0 bears no resemblence whatever to Eq. (1), except for the case ΩΛ  ≪  1. Instead, we shall see that the dependence of [formula] on Ω0 near Ω0 = 1 with ΩM fixed at values less than 0.4 is much stronger than given by Eq. (1) (for instance, [formula] for ΩM = 0.3), and it depends sensitively on ΩM.

To calculate the full dependence of [formula] on Ω0, ΩM, Ωbaryon, Ωradiation, etc. is a complicated task, requiring the consideration of the evolution of the acoustic velocity and of the ratio of radiation and matter energies, and the consideration of Doppler shifts as well as temperature fluctuations. We can avoid all these complications by considering the dependence of [formula] on Ω0 when only ΩΛ is allowed to vary, with ΩM and all other parameters held fixed. If it were really true (as Eq. (1) says) that [formula] depends only on Ω0, then this would be all we need to calculate the full Ω0-dependence.

The advantage of letting only ΩΛ vary is that the vacuum energy density is negligible compared with the densities of matter and radiation at and before the redshift zL≃1100 of last scattering, so the only effect of variations in ΩΛ on the multipole number [formula] of the nth Doppler peak is to change the paths followed by light rays since the time of last scattering. The angle subtended at the earth by any feature of the cosmic microwave background of proper length d is

[formula]

where dA is the angular diameter distance of the surface of last scattering:10

[formula]

and Ωk is a measure of curvature

[formula]

It follows that the ΩΛ-dependence of [formula] is given by

[formula]

Furthermore, although the relation between the present Hubble constant H0 and the proper scales of phenomena at the time of last scattering depends on ΩM and Ωradiation, it does not depend on ΩΛ. (For instance, if we neglect radiation, then the acoustic horizon at the redshift of last scattering is [formula].) Therefore, with ΩM fixed, the dependence of [formula] on ΩΛ is given by

[formula]

with Ωk given in terms of ΩΛ by Eq. (4). (The lower limit on the integral has here been set equal to zero because zL >  > 1.) Of course, all the detailed physics of the acoustic oscillations responsible for the Doppler peaks is contained in the constant of proportionality; all we need to know here is that it does not involve ΩΛ.

Now let us consider the variation of the quantity (6) as we make small changes in Ω0 near Ω0 = 1 with ΩM fixed. An elementary calculation gives

[formula]

where

[formula]

with

[formula]

The table below gives values of these integrals, and of the resulting exponent ν in Eq. (7).

The only approximation made in deriving these results is that the universe becomes transparent suddenly at a redshift zL  ≫  1, and has been dominated since then by non-relativistic matter and vacuum energy. Also, we are neglecting the effect of changing gravitational potentials at redshifts z  ≪  zL, which introduce an additional Λ- dependence11 that is quite small at the wavelengths of the Doppler peaks. Otherwise, these results are exact.

The behavior [formula] near Ω0 = 1 for ΩM fixed at unity is close to the behaviour [formula] near Ω0 = 1 found2,5 for ΩΛ fixed at zero, confirming that [formula] is approximately a function of Ω0 alone for ΩΛ = 0 and ΩM near unity. The fact that ν depends strongly on ΩM for smaller values of ΩM shows that for observationally favored parameters [formula] is not approximately a function of Ω0 alone. Indeed, there is no physical reason why [formula] should be even approximately a function of Ω0 alone. For fixed values of ΩM less than 0.4 the [formula] fall off with increasing Ω0 much more rapidly than would be expected from Eq. (1), so the measurement of the positions of the Doppler peaks provides a more stringent constraint on Ω0 than would be the case if Eq. (1) were correct.
