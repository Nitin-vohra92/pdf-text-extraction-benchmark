Introduction

The experimental search for dibaryons continues since over 20 years (for recent reviews see [\cite=troy] [\cite=tat1]). The dibaryons considered couple usually to two nucleons and reflect their symmetry. Therefore, such dibaryons have estimated decay widths from several MeV up to a few hundreds MeV. However, their production cross sections in reactions involving nucleons and pions are small and the spectra are dominated by a large background. This has lead to contradictory results and the dibaryons decaying directly into two nucleons are not unequivocally established.

We consider a new class of dibaryons - supernarrow dibaryons (SNDs), the decay of which into two nucleons is forbidden by the Pauli exclusion principle [\cite=mul] [\cite=fil1] [\cite=fil2] [\cite=ger]. Such dibaryons with masses M < 2mN + mπ, where mN(mπ) is the nucleon (pion) mass, can decay into two nucleons, by emitting a third particle, normally a photon. The decay widths of these dibaryons are predicted to be ≤  1 keV [\cite=fil2].

In the framework of the MIT bag model, Mulders et al. [\cite=mul] calculated the masses of different dibaryons, in particular, NN-decoupled dibaryons. These dibaryons D(T = 0;JP = 0-,1-,2-;M = 2.11 GeV) and D(1;1-;2.2 GeV) correspond to the states 13PJ and 31P1 forbidden in the NN channel. However, the masses of these dibaryon exceed the pion production threshold. Therefore, these dibaryons can decay into the πNN channel and their decay widths are larger than 1 MeV.

Using the chiral soliton model, Kopeliovich [\cite=kop] predicted that the masses of D(T = 1,JP = 1+) and D(0,2+) NN-decoupled dibaryons exceeded the two nucleon mass by 60 and 90 MeV, respectively. These values are lower than the pion production threshold.

In the framework of the canonically quantized biskyrmion model Krupovnickas al. [\cite=riska] obtained an indication of the existence of one dibaryon with J=T=0 and two dibaryons with J=T=1 with masses smaller than 2mN + mπ.

All these results are model calculations of very limited predictive power and provide just a motivation to look for SNDs. In the following we summerize the experimental attempts to look for such dibaryons so far.

In ref. [\cite=khr] dibaryons with exotic quantum numbers were searched for in the process pp  →  ppγγ. The experiment was performed with a proton beam from the JINR phasotron at an energy of about 216 MeV. The energy spectrum of the photons emitted at [formula] was measured and showed two peaks. This behavior of the photon energy spectrum was interpreted as a signature of an exotic dibaryon resonance with a mass of about 1956 MeV and possible isospin T = 2. However, the results of ref. [\cite=str] make the possibility of a production of dibaryons with T = 2 in this reaction questionable. So, additional careful studies of the reaction pp  →  ppγγ are needed to more correctly understand the nature of the observed state.

An analysis of the Uppsala proton-proton bremsstrahlung data [\cite=cal] looking for the presence of a dibaryon in the mass range from 1900 to 1960 MeV gave only upper limits of 10 and 3 nb for the dibaryon production cross section at proton beam energies of 200 and 310 MeV, respectively. This result agrees with the expected values of the cross section obtained at the conditions of this experiment in the framework of the model of dibaryon production and decay suggested in ref. [\cite=prc] and does not contradict the data of ref. [\cite=khr].

In our previous studies [\cite=izv] [\cite=ksf] [\cite=yad] [\cite=prc] we investigated the reaction pd  →  pX in order to search for SNDs. In this process SNDs can be produced only if the nucleons in the deuteron overlap sufficiently, such that a six-quark state with deuteron quantum numbers can be formed. Then, an interaction of a meson or another particle with this state can change its quantum numbers so that a metastable state is formed. The experiment was carried out at the proton beam of the Linear Accelerator of INR using the two-arm spectrometer TAMS. As was shown in ref. [\cite=yad] [\cite=prc], the nucleons and the deuteron from the decay of SND into γNN and γd have to be emitted into a narrow angular cone with respect to the direction of the dibaryon. If a dibaryon decays mainly into two nucleons, then the expected angular cone of the emitted nucleons is about [formula]. Therefore, a detection of the scattered proton in coincidence with the proton (or the deuteron) from the decay of particle X at correlated angles allowed to suppress effectively the contribution of the background processes and to increase the relative contribution of a possible SND production. As a result, two narrow peaks in missing mass spectra have been observed at M = 1905 and 1924 MeV with widths equal to the experimental resolution (~  3MeV) and with 4.8 and 4.9 standard deviations (SD), respectively. The analysis of the angular distributions of the charged particles (p or d) from the decay of particle X showed that the peak found at 1905 MeV most likely corresponds to a SND with isotopic spin equal to 1. In ref. [\cite=prc] arguments were presented that the resonance at M = 1924 MeV could be SND, too.

Experiment

In this paper we present a new study of the pd  →  pX reaction at the Linear Accelerator of INR with 305 MeV proton beam using the spectrometer TAMS where the proton and deuteron from the decays X  →  pX1 and X  →  dX2 are measured in coincidence with the scattered proton.

In the experiment, CD2 and 12C were used as targets. The scattered proton was detected in the left arm of the spectrometer TAMS at the angle [formula]. The second charged particle (either p or d) was detected in the right arm by three telescopes located at [formula], [formula], and [formula].

A trigger was generated by four-fold coincidences of the two ΔE detector signals of the left arm combined with those of any telescope of the right arm. The events contained information about time-of-flights and full energies of two particles detected in coincidence in the left and right arms of the spectrometer. The energy resolution was 4 MeV (7 MeV) for the left (right) arm. A time-of-flight resolution better than 0.5 ns was achieved. Each valid event including two time-of-flights and two energies were stored event by event and then analyzed off line.

An off-line identification of different particles was performed by means of their energies E and time-of-flights t. In this way, protons and other charged particles were identified via characteristic loci observed in two dimensional diagrams of time-of-flight versus energy. As an example such an experimental E - t distribution for the right arm detector at [formula] is displayed in Fig. 1. This figure shows the band of proton events, presenting the dependence of the proton time-of-flight on its energy, and a spot corresponding to the deuteron from the elastic pd scattering.

Several software cuts have been applied to the mass spectra. The energy of the scattered proton was limited by an interval of 50 < E2 < 150 MeV, that corresponded to the interval of measured dibaryon masses 1980 > MpX1  (MdX2)  >  1860 MeV/c2. In order to suppress the background from the reaction p  12C  →  dY, where Y stands for the unobserved particles, in MdX2 spectra, we omitted events with a deuteron energy higher than the energy of the elastically scattered deuteron in the pd  →  pd reaction at the given angles. For the MpX1 spectra the energy interval for the proton from the SND decay was determined by the kinematics of the decay of X into the γNN channel. This interval was equal to 50 < Ep < 100 MeV. Such a cut allows to suppress essentially the contribution from the reaction pd  →  ppn. The main contribution to this reaction at the energy under consideration is given by one-nucleon pole diagrams when one of the nucleons is a spectator. These diagrams give the maximum contribution when the kinetic energy of the spectator nucleon approaches zero.

Missing mass spectra of MpX1 and MdX2 were determined with the expression

[formula]

with the additional condition that the proton from the X  →  pX1 and the deuteron from the X  →  dX2 decay were detected in the right arm detector of the TAMS spectrometer. In this expression mp(d) is the proton (deuteron) mass, Eti and Etf are the total energies and pi and pf are the momenta of the incident and scattered protons, respectively.

The missing mass MdX2 spectrum of the reaction pd  →  pdX2 for the angle [formula] (Fig. 2) has a peak at the deuteron mass. This peak corresponds to the elastic pd scattering. A measurement of this reaction at different angles of the right and left arms was used to calibrate the spectrometer. The over all mass resolution of the spectrometer was ~  5 MeV, the angular resolution [formula].

Results and Discussions

We first consider the pd  →  pX  →  ppX1 reaction. Figs. 3a-3c depict the experimental missing mass MpX1 spectra obtained with the CD2 and 12C targets, where (3a), (3b), and (3c) correspond to a detection of the second proton in the right arm detector at [formula], [formula], and [formula], respectively. The background in these spectra are interpolated by polynomials. Three peaks at MpX1 = 1904  ±  2, 1926±  2, and 1942±  2 MeV are clearly visible in these spectra. The first two of them confirm the values of the dibaryon mass obtained by us earlier [\cite=izv] [\cite=ksf] [\cite=yad] [\cite=prc], whereas the resonance at 1942 MeV is a new one. This additional resonance is due to the different kinematical coverage of the new experiment. In this experiment we could decrease the detection threshold of the scattered proton down to 50 MeV giving us a broader acceptance in the missing mass.

The experimental missing mass spectra, obtained with the carbon target, are rather smooth. This smoothness is caused by both, an essential increase of the contribution of background reactions in the interaction of the proton with the carbon and the Fermi motion of the nucleons in the nucleus. The latter increases essentially the angular cone of the emitted nucleons. In consequence, it is not possible to see peaks of SNDs on the carbon target. As the experiment with the carbon target resulted in the rather smooth spectra, all structures, appearing in the experiment with the CD2 target, have to be attributed to an interaction of the proton with the deuteron.

The experimental spectra in Figs. 3a-3c are compared with the prediction of the theoretical model of SNDs D(T = 1,JP = 1±) production constructed in the one meson exchange approach [\cite=prc] and normalized to the values of peaks in Fig. 3a. Our calculation for the isovector SND D(T = 1,JP = 1±) with the mass M=1904 MeV showed that the contributions of such a dibaryon to the spectra at angles [formula], [formula], and [formula] must relate as 1:0.92:0.42. For the isoscalar SND D(0,0±) one obtains 1:0.95:0.67. The biggest contribution of the SND with M = 1926 MeV is expected at [formula]. However, the angles [formula] were not investigated in this work. The calculation of the ratio of the contributions to the missing mass spectra at the angles [formula], [formula], and [formula] gave 1:0.85:0.34 for T = 1 and 1:0.71:0.46 for T = 0.

Nucleons from the decay of the SND with M = 1942 MeV have a wider angular distribution due to the the higher mass and consequently the higher transverse momenta in the decay X  →  pX1 according to the calculations with a maximum in the region of [formula]. In the region of the angles under consideration here, the contributions of the D(1,1±) are expected to behave as 1:0.6:0.2. For the SND D(0,0±) we have 1:0.78:0.55.

All these predictions for the SNDs are in agreement with our experimental data within the errors. However, the analysis of the reaction pd  →  ppX1 only in the considered angular range does not allow to determine an isotopic spin of the SNDs.

If the observed states are NN-coupled dibaryons decaying mainly into two nucleons then the expected angular cone size of emitted nucleons must be more than [formula]. Therefore, their contributions to the missing mass spectra in Fig. 3a-3c would be nearly constant and would not exceed a few events, even assuming that the dibaryon production cross section is equal to that of elastic pd scattering (~  40μb/sr). Hence, the peaks found most likely correspond to SNDs.

The missing mass MdX2 spectrum of the reaction pd  →  pX  →  pdX2, for the sum of angles [formula] and [formula] is shown in Fig. 4. As seen from this figure, the reaction pd  →  pdX2 gives a very small contribution to the production of the dibaryons under study.

On the other hand, it is expected [\cite=yad] [\cite=prc] that isoscalar SNDs contribute mainly in the γd and isovector SNDs in the γNN channels. As the main contribution of the indicated dibaryons is observed in pX1 channel, it is possible to suppose that X1  →  γn and all found states are isovector SNDs. A more precise conclusion about the value of the isotopic spin of the observed SNDs could be obtained by the study of the reaction pd  →  npX1. The experiment on the SND photoproduction in the process [formula] with polarized photons could separate the D(T = 1,JP = 1+,S = 1) and D(1,1-,0) states [\cite=alek] where S is the spin of the SND.

The sum of missing mass spectra of the reaction pd  →  ppX1 over angles [formula] and [formula], where the contribution of the SNDs is maximum, is presented in Fig. 5a. This spectrum was fitted by a polynomial for the background plus Gaussians for the peaks. The number of standard deviations (SD) is then determined from this spectrum as

[formula]

where Neff is the number of events above the background curve and Nback is the number of events below this curve. Taking nine points for each peak, we have 6.0, 7.0, and 6.3 SD for the resonances at 1904, 1926, and 1942 MeV, respectively. The widths of these resonances are equal to the experimental resolution of ~  5 MeV.

An additional information about the nature of the observed states has been obtained by studying the missing mass MX1 spectra of the reaction pd  →  ppX1. If the state found is a dibaryon decaying mainly into two nucleons then X1 is a neutron and the mass MX1 is equal to the neutron mass mn. If the value of MX1, obtained from the experiment, differs essentially from mn then X1  →  γn and we have the additional indication that the observed dibaryon is SND.

The simulation of the missing MX1 mass spectra for the reaction pd  →  ppX1 has been performed assuming that the SND decayed as SND  →  γd(31S0)  →  γpn through the two-nucleon singlet state 31S0 [\cite=fil2] [\cite=prc]. Such a decay is characterized in the rest frame by a narrow peak near the maximum photon energy in the probability distribution of the dibaryon decay over an emitted photon energy. As a result of this simulation, in the missing MX1 spectra three narrow peaks at MX1  =  965, 987, and 1003 MeV have been predicted. These peaks correspond to the isovector SNDs with the masses 1904, 1926, and 1942 MeV, respectively. The result of this simulation without the influence of the detector resolution is shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 6a shows the MX1 mass spectrum when the proton from the SND decay SND  →  γpn is emitted into the whole allowed angular region. The acceptance of the detectors cuts into the widths of these peaks. The missing MX1 mass spectra, taking into account the acceptance of the detectors at the angles 34[formula] and 36[formula], is presented in Fig. 6b. The experimental resolutions widen these peaks to 6 - 8 MeV.

Fig. 5b depicts the sum of the missing mass MX1 spectra for the angles [formula] and [formula]. As is seen from this figure, besides the peak at the neutron mass, which is caused by the process pd  →  ppn, peaks are observed at 966  ±  2, 986  ±  2, and 1003  ±  2 MeV. Hence, for all states under study, we have X1  →  γn in support of the assumption that the dibaryons found are SNDs.

It should be noted that the peak at MX1 = 1003  ±  2 MeV corresponds to the resonance found in ref. [\cite=tat2] and was attributed to an exotic baryon state N* below the πN threshold. In that work, the authors found altogether three such states with masses 1004, 1044, and 1094 MeV. This is not in contradiction to our interpretation, since in principle SND could decay according to X  →  pN*. The possibility of the production of NN*-coupled dibaryons was considered in [\cite=tat1].

If the exotic baryon states decay into N*  →  γN then they would contribute to the Compton scattering on the nucleon. However, the analysis [\cite=lvov] of the existing experimental data on this process excludes N* as intermediate states in the Compton scattering on the nucleon.

In ref. [\cite=kob] it was assumed that these states belong to totally antisymmetric [formula]-plet of the spin-flavor SU(6)FS group. Such a N* can transit into a nucleon only if two quarks from the N* participate in the interaction [\cite=feyn]. Then the simplest decay of N* with the masses 1004 and 1044 MeV would be N*  →  γγN. This conjecture could be checked, in particular, by studying the reactions γp  →  γX or γp  →  πX at a photon energy close to 800 MeV.

Taking into account the mentioned connection between the SNDs and the resonancelike states X1, it is possible to assume that the peaks, observed in [\cite=tat2] at 1004 and 1044 MeV, are not exotic baryons, but they are the resonancelike states X1  →  γn caused by the existence and decay of the SNDs with the masses 1942 and 1982 MeV, respectively. Such X1 would be not real resonances and cannot give contribution to the Compton scattering on the nucleon.

Conclusions

The result of the study of the reaction pd  →  ppX1 is that three narrow peaks at 1904, 1926, and 1942 MeV have been observed in the missing mass MpX1 spectra. The analysis of the angular distributions of the protons from the decay of the pX1 states and the data of the reaction pd  →  pX  →  pdX2 showed that the peaks found can be explained as a manifestation of the isovector SNDs, the decay of which into two nucleons is forbidden by the Pauli exclusion principle. The observation of the peaks in the missing mass MX1 spectra at 966, 985, and 1003 MeV is an additional confirmation that the dibaryons found are the SNDs.
