On the bisymmetric nonnegative inverse eigenvalue problem

Introduction

The Nonnegative Inverse Eigenvalue Problem was started when Kolmokorov [\cite=Kol] asked the following question in 1937: When is a given complex number an eigenvalue of some nonnegative matrix? Later, in 1949, Suleimanova [\cite=sul] extended this question to the problem of determining necessary and sufficient conditions for a list of n complex numbers to be the eigenvalues of an n  ×  n nonnegative matrix which nowadays is called the Nonnegative Inverse Eigenvalues Problem(NIEP). The set of n complex numbers is said to be realizable if there is an n  ×  n nonnegative matrix having these complex numbers as its eigenvalues. In particular, if we consider the list of n real numbers then the problem is called the Real Nonnegative Inverse Eigenvalue Problem (RNIEP). Sufficient conditions for the RNIEP have been studied by Suleimanova [\cite=sul], H. Perfect [\cite=per], P.G. Ciarlet [\cite=ciarlet], Kellogg [\cite=Kel], A. Brobia [\cite=borobia], Salzmann [\cite=salz], G.W. Soules [\cite=soules], G.Wuwen [\cite=wuwen], R.L. Soto and O.Rojo [\cite=soto] [\cite=soto2]. In this section, we collect several important sufficient conditions for the NIEP.

(Suleimanova [\cite=sul], 1949)

If [formula] are real numbers such that [formula] then [formula] is realizable.

(Kellog [\cite=Kel], 1971)

If [formula] are real numbers and [formula], and if

[formula]   for all k∈K,

[formula] then [formula]

(Borobia [\cite=borobia], 1995)

If [formula] are real numbers and there is a partition [formula] of [formula] such that

[formula]

satisfies the Kellogg's condition, then [formula] is realizable.

In [\cite=fdl], M. Fiedler showed that the sufficient conditions of Theorem [\ref=suleimanova] and Theorem [\ref=kellogg] are also the sufficient conditions for the existence of symmetric nonnegative matrices with the prescribed eigenvalues. The problem of finding the necessary and sufficient conditions on the list of n complex numbers to be a spectrum of a symmetric nonnegative matrix is called the Symmetric Nonnegative Inverse Eigenvalue Problem (SNIEP). In [\cite=nizar], N. Radwan improved the sufficient condition of Theorem [\ref=borobia] to the sufficient condition for the SNIEP. Other sufficient conditions of the SNIEP were also studied in [\cite=soto3] [\cite=soto4] [\cite=loewy] [\cite=mcdonald] [\cite=laffey]. The relations among sufficient conditions for the RNIEP (and also for the SNIEP) were collected and discussed in [\cite=carlos]. Later on, the sufficient conditions for the NIEP were studied in certain specific classes of matrices, for example, for normal matrices, the problem was studied by N. Radwan [\cite=nizar], and for symmetric circulant matrices and symmetric centrosymmetric matrices (equivalent to bisymmetric matrices), the problem were investigated in [\cite=rojo]. Most recently, in [\cite=julio], A.I. Julio and R.L.Soto presented some sufficient conditions for the persymmetric and bisymmetric NIEP. Moreover, they showed that the sufficient condition in Theorem [\ref=suleimanova] is also the sufficient condition for the bisymmetric nonnegative inverse eigenvalue problem (BNIEP).

Recall that a bisymmetric matrix is a square matrix that is symmetric with respect to both the diagonal line from the upper-left to the lower-right and is also symmetric to the diagonal line from the lower-left to the upper-right. Any bisymmetric matrix is a symmetric and persymmetric matrix. Moreover, A squre matrix is a bisymmetric matrix if and only if it is a symmetric centrosymmetric matrix. Thus, a square matrix A is a bisymmetric matrix if and only if AT = A and JAJ = A, where J is the reverse identity matrix, i.e., [formula] Many results on symmetric centrosymmetric (bisymmetric) matrices were discussed by P. Butler and A. Cantoni in [\cite=can]. Here, we collect some of these results.

(Cantoni and Butler [\cite=can], 1976)

Let Q be an n  ×  n bisymmetric matrix.

(1) If n is an even number then Q is of the form [formula], where A and C are [formula] matrices A = AT and CT = JCJ.

(2) If n = 2m + 1 is an odd number then Q is of the form [formula], where x is an m  ×  1 matrix, A and C are m  ×  m matrices, A = AT and CT = JCJ.

(Cantoni and Butler [\cite=can], 1976)

Let Q be an n  ×  n bisymmetric matrix.

(1) If n is an even number and Q is of the form [formula] then Q orthogonally similar to the matrix [formula].

(2) If n = 2m + 1 is an odd number and Q is of the form [formula] then Q orthogonally similar to the matrix [formula].

Some sufficient conditions for the BNIEP are recently studied by Julio and Soto [\cite=julio]. The origin of these sufficient conditions for the BNIEP in [\cite=julio] comes from the rank-r perturbation results due to Rado and introduced by Perfect. In [\cite=soto2], Soto and Rojo reapplied the results of Perfect into the sufficient conditions of NIEP. Moreover, in [\cite=soto4] these sufficient conditions were used to be sufficient conditions for the SNIEP. Some related theorems about sufficient conditions of BNIEP are collected below:

(Rado [\cite=rado], 1955)

Let A be an n  ×  n arbitrary matrix with eigenvalues [formula] and, for some r  ≤  n, let [formula]. Let X be an n  ×  r matrix with rank r such that its columns [formula] satisfy [formula]. Let C be an r  ×  n arbitrary matrix. Then A + XC has eigenvalues [formula], where [formula] are eigenvalues of the matrix Ω + CX.

(Soto [\cite=soto4], 2007)

Let A be an n  ×  n symmetric matrix with eigenvalues [formula] and, for some r  ≤  n, let [formula] be an orthonormal set of eigenvectors of A spanning the invariant subspace associated with [formula]. Let X be the n  ×  r matrix with the ith column xi, let [formula], and let C be any r  ×  r symmetric matrix. Then the symmetric matrix A + XCXT has eigenvalues [formula], where [formula] are eigenvalues of the matrix Ω + C.

(Soto [\cite=soto4], 2007)

Let [formula] be real numbers and, for some t  ≤  n, let [formula] be real numbers satisfying [formula] If there exist

(1) a partition [formula] of [formula], in which for each j, [formula] λjpj}, λjk  ≥  λj(k + 1), λj1  ≥  0 , and λ11  =  λ1, such that for each [formula], the set Γj  =  {ωj,λj2, [formula] is realizable by a nonnegative symmetric matrix, and

(2) a t  ×  t nonnegative symmetric matrix with all eigenvalues as [formula], λt1 and diagonal entries as [formula] then [formula] is realizable by nonnegative symmetric matrix.

The next two results are the sufficient conditions for the BNEIP given by Julio and Soto in [\cite=julio].

(A.I Julio and Soto [\cite=julio], 2015)

Let [formula] be a list of real numbers with [formula] and [formula]. Suppose there exists a partition of Λ,

[formula],  for even ρ0, with

[formula],   λ01  =  λ1,

[formula],   [formula], where some of the lists Λk can be empty, such that the following conditions are satisfied:

(1) For each [formula], there exists a symmetric matrix with all eigenvalues as [formula], 0  ≤  ωk  ≤  λ1.

(2) There exists a bisymmetric nonnegative matrix of order p0, with all eigenvalues [formula] and diagonal entries [formula]. Then [formula] is realizable by an n  ×  n nonnegative bisymmetric matrix.

(A.I Julio and Soto [\cite=julio], 2015) Let [formula] be a list of real numbers with [formula] and [formula]. Suppose there exists a partition of Λ,

[formula],  for odd ρ0, with

[formula],   λ01  =  λ1,

[formula],   [formula], where some of the lists Λk can be empty, such that the following conditions are satisfied:

(1) For each [formula], there exists a symmetric matrix with all eigenvalues as [formula], 0  ≤  ωk  ≤  λ1, and there exists a bisymmetric nonnegative matrix with all eigenvalues as [formula], where [formula]

(2) There exists a p0  ×  p0 bisymmetric nonnegative matrix of order p0, with all eigenvalues [formula] and diagonal entries ω1,ω2, [formula] [formula]. Then [formula] is realizable by an n  ×  n nonnegative bisymmetric matrix.

In this article, we give some sufficient conditions for the BNIEP and also obtain some related results. In Section 2, We first start with the necessary and sufficient conditions for BNIEP in the case n  ≤  4 and then we show that SNIEP and BNIEP are different when n  =  6. In Section 3, we provide the sufficient conditions for the BNIEP based on the sufficient conditions of the NIEP and the SNIEP. Also, some results about the BNIEP due to Julio and Soto [\cite=julio] are included and proven again with a different method. In Section 4, we extend the results of Section 3 to the results on the bisymmetric positive matrices. Then we provide the sufficient conditions for the BNEIP with the prescribed diagonal entries in the last section.

The BNIEP for Matrices Having Small Sizes

Let [formula] be real numbers. The well-known necessary conditions for an existence of an n  ×  n nonnegative matrix with all eigenvalues as [formula] are [formula] and λ1  ≥  |λn|. Moreover, if n  ≤  4 then these necessary conditions are also sufficient conditions for the RNIEP. In 1997 Wuwen [\cite=wuwen] showed that the RNIEP and the SNIEP are equivalent for any list of n  ≤  4 real numbers. In fact, the fact that the RNIEP and the SNIEP are different was proven by Johnson et al. in [\cite=johnson]. In this section we will show that, for n  ≤  4, those necessary conditions for the RNIEP are also sufficient conditions for an existence of an n  ×  n nonnegative bisymmetric matrix with all eigenvalues as [formula]. Also, we show that the SNIEP is different from the BNIEP when n = 6. We start this section by the following lemmas.

Let Q be an n ×   n nonnegative bisymmetric matrix with the Perron root λ0.

(a) If n is even and Q is of the form [formula] then λ0 is the Perron root of A + JC.

(b) If n = 2m + 1 is odd and Q is of the form [formula] then λ0 is the Perron root of [formula].

Since Q is a nonnegative matrix with the Perron root λ0, λ0 is also an eigenvalue of Q.

(a) Let [formula] be an eigenvector of Q corresponding to λ0. Then Qv = λ0v implies

[formula]

So,

Av1 + JCJv2 = λ0v1 and Cv1 + JAJv2 = λ0v2. Then

[formula]

This shows that λ0 is an eigenvalue of A + JC. Since all eigenvalues of A + JC are eigenvalues of Q and λ0 is the Perron root of Q, λ0 is also the Perron root of A + JC.

(b) Let [formula] be an eigenvector of Q corresponding to λ0. By the argument as in part (a), we can show that λ0 is the Perron root of [formula] with a corresponding eigenvector [formula]

Let Q be an n  ×  n nonnegative bisymmetric matrix. If v is an eigenvector corresponding to an eigenvalue λ of Q then so is Jv. Moreover, if λ0 is the Perron root of Q then there is a nonnegative eigenvector v0 such that Jv0 = v0.

Let v be an eigenvector of Q corresponding to the Perron root λ. So, Qv = λv. Since JQJ = Q, JQ = QJ, and hence QJv = JQv = λJv. This shows that Jv is also an eigenvector of Q corresponding to λ. Now, let [formula] be a nonnegative eigenvector corresponding to λ0 where λ0 is the Perron root of Q. If n is even number, by Theorem [\ref=canthm1], Q is of the form [formula], and thus we have [formula]. It follows that

[formula]

So,

[formula]

This shows that [formula] is a nonnegative eigenvector corresponding to λ0 as desire.

On the other hand, if n = 2m + 1 is an odd number and [formula] is a nonnegative eigenvector corresponding to the Perron root λ0 then we can also show that the nonnegative vector [formula] is an eigenvector corresponding to λ0.

Let A be an m  ×  m nonnegative bisymmetric matrix with eigenvalues [formula] and let u1 be a unit nonnegative eigenvector corresponding to α1 such that Ju1 = u1; let B be an n  ×  n nonnegative bisymmetric matrix with eigenvalues [formula] and let v1 be a unit nonnegative eigenvector corresponding to β1 such that Jv1 = v1. If γ1,γ2,γ3 are all eigenvalues of the matrix

[formula]

where ρ, ξ  ≥   0, then the matrix

[formula]

is a nonnegative bisymmetric matrix with all eigenvalues as

[formula]

Let [formula] be an orthonormal system of eigenvectors of A. Similarly, let v1, v2, [formula], vn form an orthonormal system of eigenvectors of B and [formula] form an orthonormal system of eigenvectors of Ĉ. It's easy to see that [formula] are m+2n linearly independent eigenvectors of C corresponding to eigenvalues αi,βj,γk for [formula] and k = 1,2,3, respectively.

We see that C is a nonnegative matrix since A and B are nonnegative symmetric matrices with Perron roots α1 and β1, respectively, u1 and v1 are nonnegative vectors and ρ,ξ  ≥  0. Moreover, C is bisymmetric because A and B are bisymmetric matrices and Ju1 = u1,Jv1 = v1.

Note that Lemma [\ref=lep] is a special case of Theorem [\ref=julio2]. However, we need this lemma in order to construct our desired bisymmetric nonnegative matrix. In Lemma [\ref=lep], we see that the eigenvalues γ1, γ2 and γ3 of Ĉ depend on ρ and ξ. If [formula] and ξ  =   - b, where a, b are real numbers such that α1  -  β1 ≥   a ≥  b and a + b  ≤  0, then α1  -  (a + b), β1 + a and β1 + b are all eigenvalues of Ĉ. Then we have the following result.

Let A and B be nonnegative bisymmetric matrices as in Lemma [\ref=lep] with α1  ≥  β1. If a, b are real numbers such that α1  -  β1  ≥  a  ≥  b and a + b  ≤  0 then there is a nonnegative bisymmetric matrix with all eigenvalues as α1  -  (a + b),β1 + a, β1 + b, α2 , α3, [formula], αm , β2, β3, [formula], βn, β2, β3, [formula], βn.

Let A and B be square matrices and B is of the form [formula]. We know that the eigenvalues of matrix [formula] are all the eigenvalues of the matrix [formula]. We use this fact and Lemma [\ref=lep] to construct a nonnegative bisymmetric matrix with all eigenvalues [formula], where n  ≤  4, λ1  ≥  |λn| and [formula].

Let [formula] be real numbers. If n  ≤  4 then the necessary conditions λ1  ≥  |λn| and [formula] are also the sufficient conditions for an existence of nonnegative bisymmetric matrix with all eigenvalues as [formula]

First, we consider when n = 2. In this case, we have λ1  ≥  λ2 and λ1  +  λ2  ≥  0. Then the matrix [formula] is a nonnegative bisymmetric matrix with eigenvalues λ1 and λ2.

Next, suppose that n = 3. In this case, we have λ1  +  λ3  ≥  0. If λ2  ≥  0, then the matrix [formula] will be a desired nonnegative bisymmetric matrix. If λ2  <  0, then using Corollary [\ref=cor1] with [formula], [formula], a = λ2 and b = λ3, we can construct the desired matrix Q as

[formula]

Finally, we consider the case n = 4. In this case, we have λ1  +  λ4  ≥  0. If λ2  +  λ3  ≥  0 then the matrix [formula] is a nonnegative matrix with eigenvalues λ2,λ3 and the matrix [formula] is a nonnegative matrix with eigenvalues λ1,λ4. Then the nonnegative bisymmetric matrix

[formula]

is the desired matrix. If λ2  +  λ3  <  0 then using Corollary [\ref=cor1] with

[formula] , [formula], a = λ2 and b = λ3,

we can construct the desired matrix Q as

[formula]

where [formula] is a unit eigenvector of A corresponding to eigenvalue λ1  +  λ2  +  λ3.

By Theorem [\ref=small], the BNIEP and the SNIEP are equivalent for n  ≤  4. Next, we show that there is no 6  ×  6 bisymmetric nonnegative matrix with the eigenvalues as 6,6, - 2, - 3, - 3, - 4 while the symmetric nonnegative matrix

[formula]

has them as its eigenvalues, that is, the BNIEP and the SNIEP are different for n = 6.

For n = 6, the BNIEP and the SNIEP are different.

It suffices to show that there is no 6  ×  6 bisymmetric nonnegative matrix with eigenvalues as 6,6, - 2, - 3, - 3, - 4. Suppose Q is a 6  ×  6 nonnegative bisymmetric matrix with these eigenvalues. Then Q must be a reducible matrix by Perron-Frobenius Theorem. Therefore there is a permutation matrix P such that

[formula]

where A1,A2 are 3  ×  3 nonnegative symmetric matrices with the set of all eigenvalues as {6, - 3, - 3} and {6, - 2, - 4}, respectively. Since the matrix [formula] is the only 3  ×  3 nonnegative symmetric matrix which has eigenvalues 6, - 3, - 3, A1 must be this matrix. Let [formula] where α,β,γ  ≥  0. Then we have

[formula]

Since 6, - 2, - 4 are all eigenvalues of A2, α,β and γ can not be identical. If one of α,β and γ is 0, then 0 is an eigenvlues of A2, which is impossible. Therefore α,β and γ are positive numbers. Now, we consider in two cases.

Case 1: α,β and γ are all distinct positive numbers. In this case, at least two numbers of α,β and γ must be distinct from 3. WLOG, let α  ≠  3,β  ≠  3 and α  ≠  β.

Since each of value α and β appears twice in the matrix S, α and β must be on the secondary main diagonal line of the matrix Q. But α and β are in the forth column of S. This is impossible because any two entries from the same column of S cannot be permuted by the permutation matrix P to two entries lying in the different columns of Q .

Case 2: Two of the numbers α,β and γ are same positive numbers and different from another one. Without loss of generality, let α  =  β and α  ≠  γ.

If α  ≠  3 then α appears four times in the matrix S. Then α and β must be on the different columns of Q. This is impossible by the similar reasoning as in case 1.

Finally, if α  =  β = 3 and γ  ≠  3, then the characteristic polynomial of A2 is x3 - (γ2 + 18)x - 18γ which can not be equal to (x - 6)(x + 2)(x + 4) for any positive number γ.

This shows that there is no 6  ×  6 bisymmetric nonnegative matrix with eigenvalues as 6,6, - 2, - 3, - 3, - 4.

Sufficient Conditions for the BNIEP

In this section, we will find sufficient conditions for the existence of a nonnegative bisymmetric matrix and a positive bisymmetric matrix with prescribed eigenvalues. We begin this section by considering the sufficient condition of Theorem [\ref=suleimanova] in which it was improved to the bisymmetric case by A. Julio and Soto [\cite=julio]. However, we give another proof using Lemma [\ref=lep].

(Julio and Soto, Theorem 4.3 in[\cite=julio])

Let [formula] be real numbers. If [formula] then there is an (n + 1)  ×  (n + 1) nonnegative bisymmetric matrix with all eigenvalues as [formula]

We will prove this theorem by induction on n. If n = 0, the assertion is clear. If n = 1,2 and 3, the assertions follow from Theorem [\ref=small].

Let n  ≥  4 and suppose that the assertion is true for all smaller systems of numbers such that satisfy our assumption. If λ0 = 0 then λi  =  0, for all i = 0,1,2,...,n, and the zero matrix of size (n + 1)  ×  (n + 1) is the required matrix. Now suppose λ0  >  0. Clearly, the system λ0  +  λ1  +  λ2,λ3,λ4,...,λn satisfies the assumption. By the induction hypothesis, there is a nonnegative bisymmetric matrix A with eigenvalues λ0  +  λ1  +  λ2,λ3,λ4,...,λn. It's easy to check that the matrix A and B = (0), a = λ1 and b = λ2 satisfy the condition in Corollary [\ref=cor1]. Therefore, there is a nonnegative bisymmetric matrix Q with all eigenvalues as λ0,λ1,...,λn.

Now, we consider the sufficient condition in theorem [\ref=borobia]. In section 2, we proved that there is no 6  ×  6 bisymmetric nonnegative matrix with eigenvalues 6,6, - 2, - 3, - 3, - 4 even though this list of numbers satisfies the condition of Theorem [\ref=borobia]. This implies that the sufficient condition of Theorem [\ref=borobia] can not be improved to the bisymmetric case. However, if the size of each patition Λk of Λ in Theorem [\ref=borobia] is odd for all [formula] then we show that with this additional assumption together with the assumption in Theorem [\ref=borobia], there is a nonnegative bisymmetric matrix with the prescribed eigenvalues. We start with the following lemma.

Let Q1 and Q2 be nonnegative bisymmetric matrices with all eigenvalues [formula] and [formula] If α0  ≥  β0 and m or n is odd, then for any ε  ≥  0, there is a nonnegative bisymmetric matrix with all eigenvalues as [formula]

Suppose m is odd and n is even. Then [formula] and [formula] where A,C are [formula] ×   [formula] matrices, D,E are [formula] matrices, and A = AT,D = DT,CT = JCJ,ET = JEJ. Now, let [formula] be all eigenvalues of the matrix A + JC and [formula] be all eigenvalues of the matrix [formula] By Theorem 2.1 and Theorem 2.2 in [\cite=fdl], we have the matrix

[formula]

where [formula], and u0 and [formula] are nonnegative unit eigenvectors corresponding to α0, β0, respectively, has all eigenvalues as α0  +  ε, β0  -  ε, α11, α12, [formula],[formula], β12, [formula], [formula], and this matrix is similar to the matrix [formula] Finally, let the matrix

[formula]

[formula]

and [formula] Then the matrix

[formula]

is the desired matrix. In the other cases, we can construct our nonnegative bisymmetric matrices in a similar way as we constructed above.

Let [formula] be real numbers. If there exists a partition [formula] of [formula], with M  ≤  S, |Λj| is odd for [formula] and Tk  =   [formula], with [formula] satisfying

(1) [formula], for all k∈K, and

(2) [formula] where [formula], then there is a nonnegative bisymmetric matrix with all eigenvalues as λ0,λ1,...,λn.

We prove by induction on M. If M = 0 and S  ≥  1, the result follows from Theorem [\ref=impsul].

If M = 1,S = 1 and 1 ∉K, then λ1  +  T1  ≥  0 implies λ0  +  T1  ≥  0. Thus by Theorem [\ref=impsul], there is a nonnegative bisymmetric Q with all eigenvalues as [formula] and [formula], where A and C are [formula] matrices, A = AT,JCJ = CT. Then the matrix [formula] would be our nonnegative bisymmetric matrix.

If M = 1,S = 1 and 1 ∈K, by condition (1) of the assumption, it implies that λ0  +  T1  ≥  0, and hence this case similar to the previous case.

If M = 1,S > 1 and 1 ∉K, by (2), it implies that [formula]. Then by Theorem [\ref=impsul], there is a nonnegative bisymmetric Q1 with all eigenvalues obtained from all numbers in [formula]. Since λ1  +  T1  ≥  0 and |Λ1| is odd, by Theorem [\ref=impsul] again, there is a nonnegative bisymmetric [formula] with the eigenvalues obtained from {λ1},Λ1. Thus, the matrix [formula] is our desired matrix.

If M = 1,S > 1 and 1 ∈K, then by (2), [formula] By Theorem [\ref=impsul], there is a nonnegative bisymmetric matrix Q1 with all eigenvalues obtained from all the numbers in [formula] Since - T1 + T1 = 0, by Theorem [\ref=impsul] again, there is a nonnegative bisymmetric matrix Q2 with all eigenvalues obtained from all numbers in {  - T1} and Λ1. If λ0  +  T1  ≥   - (λ1 + T1), then applying Lemma [\ref=lf3] with ε  =   - (λ1 + T1), (or ε  =  λ0 + T1), we get the desired matrix.

Now, let M  ≥  2 and suppose the assertion is true for all system of λ's satisfying the assumption of the assertion with the length less than M. If there is j such that 1  ≤  j  ≤  M and λj + Tj  ≥  0, by Theorem [\ref=impsul], there is a nonnegative bisymmetric matrix [formula] with eigenvalues obtained from all numbers in {λj} and Λj. Note that the system

[formula]

satisfies (1) and (2). By the induction hypothesis, there is a nonnegative bisymmetric matrix Q with all eigenvalues obtained from all numbers in

[formula]

Therefore the matrix [formula] solve the problem.

Let λi + Ti  <  0, for all [formula] Then it's easy to check that the system [formula] satisfies the assumptions (1) and (2). Therefore, by the induction hypothesis, there is a nonnegative bisymmetric matrix Q1 with all eigenvalues obtained from all numbers in [formula] and λ0  +  λ1 + T1  ≥  λ2. Since - T1 + T1 = 0, by Theorem [\ref=impsul] again, there is a nonnegative bisymmetric matrix Q2 with all eigenvalues obtained from all numbers in {  - T1} and Λ1. If λ0  +  T1  ≥   - (λ1 + T1), then we apply Lemma [\ref=lf3] with ε  =   - (λ1 + T1), (or ε  =  λ0 + T1). Then we solve the problem.

Let [formula] be real numbers. If there exists a partition [formula] of [formula] where |Λj| is odd for [formula] and [formula], [formula] satisfying

(1) [formula]    , for all k∈K,

(2) [formula] where [formula], then there is a nonnegative bisymmetric matrix with all eigenvalues as [formula]

We prove by induction on M.

If M = 0 or 1 then the assertion is clear because there is no partition Λ of negative numbers.

If M = 2 then Λ1={λ3,λ4,ldots,λn}. If 1∉K then λ1  +  T1  ≥  0 implies λ0  +  T1  ≥  0. Similarly, if 1∈K then λ0  +  T1  ≥  0 by condition (1). Thus [formula] By Theorem [\ref=impsul], there is a nonnegative bisymmetric matrix Q with all eigenvalues [formula] So, the matrix

[formula]

is our desired matrix.

Now, let M  ≥  3 and suppose the assertion is true for all system of λ's satisfying the assumption of the assertion with the length less than M. The proof of this step is similar to the one of Theorem [\ref=impboro], so we omit the proof.

Let [formula] be real numbers. If there exists a partition [formula] of [formula], with M  >  S, |Λj| is odd for [formula] and [formula], [formula] satisfying

(1) [formula], for all k∈K, and

(2) [formula] where [formula], then there is a nonnegative bisymmetric matrix with all eigenvalues as [formula]

If M - S is even then we reduce the system by omitting [formula] The new system satisfies the condition in Theorem [\ref=impboro]. Then there is a nonnegative bisymmetric matrix Q with all eigenvalues obtained from all numbers in [formula], [formula] Since [formula], we have the matrix

[formula]

is our solution.

If M - S is odd then we reduce the system by omitting [formula] The new system satisfies the condition in Theorem [\ref=impboro2]. Then there is a nonnegative bisymmetric matrix Q with all eigenvalues obtained from all numbers in [formula] λS + 1}, [formula] Since [formula], we have the matrix

[formula]

is our solution. This completes the proof.

Let [formula] be real numbers. If there exists a partition [formula] of [formula] with |Λj| is odd for [formula] and [formula], [formula] satisfying

(1) [formula], for all k∈K, and

(2) [formula] where [formula], then there is a nonnegative bisymmetric matrix with all eigenvalues as [formula]

The theorem follows immediately from Theorem [\ref=impboro] and Theorem [\ref=impboro3] .

The statement of the next theorem is adapted from Theorem [\ref=soto4] and it is a variance of Theorem [\ref=julio1] and Theorem [\ref=julio2]. The sufficient condition in the next theorem and the sufficient condition in Theorem [\ref=julio1] and Theorem [\ref=julio2] are very similar but they are different in terms of the requirements of the nonnegative matrices in condition (1) and (2).

Let [formula] be real numbers and let [formula] be nonnegative numbers, where S  ≤  n and [formula] Suppose that

(1) there is a partition [formula] of [formula], in which there is a Λi of odd size at most one set, [formula], λjk  ≥  λj(k + 1), λj1  ≥  0 , and λ11  =  λ1, such that for each [formula], the set [formula] is realizable by a nonnegative bisymmetric matrix with the Perron root ωj, and

(2) there is an S  ×  S nonnegative symmetric matrix B with all eigenvalues as [formula] and diagonal entries [formula] Then [formula] is realizable by nonnegative bisymmetric matrix.

First, we consider in the case that Λj is of even size for all [formula]. Let for each j, Γj is realizable by a nonnegative bisymmetric matrix Qj of size even. By Theorem [\ref=canthm1], we can write [formula] , where Aj and Cj are [formula] matrices, Aj = ATj and CTj = JCjJ. Then

[formula]

is a nonnegative bisymmetric matrix with all eigenvalues obtained from all numbers in Γj, for [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=canlemma2], for each [formula] we can find the unit nonngative eigenvector of Qj corresponding to ωj in the form [formula]. Then

[formula]

form an orthonormal set of eigenvectors of [formula] corresponding to [formula], respectively. Obviously, the [formula] matrix [formula] is a nonnegative matrix with JX = X, where J is the [formula] reverse identity matrix, and X = XΩ, where Ω is diag [formula]. Therefore  + X(B - Ω)XT is a nonnegative matrix with eigenvalues [formula] by Theorem [\ref=sotos]. Moreover,  + X(B - Ω)XT is a bisymmetric matrix because [formula] is a bisymmetric and JX = X.

If there is a p such that 0  ≤  p  ≤  S, |Λp| is odd number and Γp is realizable by nonnegative bisymmetric matrix Qp then we set Qp in the center of the matrix [formula] in ([formula]) and the construction follows from the previous case.

We construct a bisymmetric nonnegative matrix with eigenvalues 9,2, - 1, - 2, - 3, - 4. We take the partion Λ1  =  { - 2, - 3, - 4} and Λ2  =  { - 1} of { - 1, - 2, - 3, - 4}. Then it satisfies the condition in the Theorem [\ref=boro4]. In fact, by Theorem [\ref=impsul], the set {9, - 2, - 3, - 4} is realizable by the nonnegative bisymmetric matrix

[formula]

Also, the set {2, - 1} is realizable by the nonnegative bisymmetric matrix [formula]. Then the matrix

[formula]

is our desired matrix.

We construct a bisymmetric nonnegative matrix with eigenvalues 9,5,1,1, - 4, - 4, - 8. Note that this list is not satisfy the condition in Theorem [\ref=boro4]. However, it satisfies condition in Theorem [\ref=imsoto3] with partition Λ1  =  {9, - 8} and Λ2  =  {5,1,1, - 4, - 4}. In fact, the set Γ1  =  {8, - 8} and Γ2  =  {6,1,1, - 4, - 4} are realizable by the nonnegative bisymmetric matrix

[formula]

respectively( see [\cite=soto2] for the construction of A2). Then

[formula]

Now, we find the nonnegative symmetric matrix with eigenvalues 9,5 and with diagonal entries 8,6. Then the matrix [formula] is required.

Therefore

[formula]

is our desired matrix.

Sufficient Conditions for the Bisymmetric Positive Eigenvalue Problem

In Theorem 3.2 of [\cite=fdl], Fiedler showed that, if A is a nonnegative symmetric matrix with all eigenvalues as [formula] and ε  >  0 is given then there is a positive symmetric matrix B with all eigenvalues as [formula] Moreover, in the proof of that theorem, we can find the positive symmetric matrix R such that B = A + R. Therefore, we can modify Theorem 3.2 of [\cite=fdl] to the following result.

(Fiedler, [\cite=fdl], 1974) If A is a nonnegative symmetric matrix with all eigenvalues as [formula] and ε  >  0 is given then there is a positive symmetric matrix R such that A + R has all eigenvalues as [formula]

Next, we improve Theorem [\ref=fdl3] to bisymmetric case.

If Q is a nonnegative bisymmetric matrix with all eigenvalues as [formula] and ε  >  0 then there is a positive bisymmetric matrix [formula] with all eigenvalues as [formula]

Let Q be a nonnegative bisymmetric matrix with all eigenvalues as λ0,λ1, [formula] λn.

Case 1: Suppose n is odd. Then we can write [formula] , where A and C are [formula] matrices, A = AT and CT = JCJ. By Theorem [\ref=canthm2] and Lemma [\ref=canlemma1], all eigenvalues of Q are obtained from the eigenvalues of A + JC and A - JC, and λ0 is an eigenvalue of A + JC. If [formula] are all eigenvalues of A + JC, by Theorem [\ref=fdl3], there is a positive symmetric matrix R such that A + JC + R has all eigenvalues as [formula] So, the matrix

[formula]

is the one we are looking for.

Case 2: Suppose n is even. Then we can write [formula] , where A and C are [formula] matrices, A = AT and CT = JCJ. By Theorem [\ref=canthm2] and Lemma [\ref=canlemma1], all eigenvalues of Q obtained from eigenvalues of [formula] and A - JC and λ0 is an eigenvalue of [formula] If [formula] are all eigenvalues of [formula], by Theorem [\ref=fdl3], there is a positive symmetric [formula], where R1 is an [formula] positive symmetric matrix, and the matrix [formula] has all eigenvalues as [formula] So, the matrix

[formula]

is our desired one.

If Q is a nonnegative bisymmetric matrix with all eigenvalues as [formula] and ε  >  0 then there is positive bisymmetric matrix P such that Q + P has all eigenvalues as [formula]

This result follows from the construction in the proof of Theorem [\ref=pbs].

Let [formula] be real numbers. If there exists a partition [formula] of [formula] with |Λj| is odd for [formula] and [formula], [formula] satisfying

(1) [formula],     for all k∈K, and

(2) [formula] where [formula], then there is a positive bisymmetric matrix with all eigenvalues as λ0,λ1,...,λn.

Let

[formula]

Then the system [formula] satisfies the condition in Theorem [\ref=boro4] . Thus there is an (n + 1)  ×  (n + 1) nonnegative bisymmetric matrix Q with all eigenvalues as [formula] By applying Theorem [\ref=pbs], the proof is complete.

The BNIEP with the Prescribe Diagonal Entries

Note that the condition (2) in Theorem [\ref=julio1] and Theorem [\ref=julio2] requires an existence of a nonnegative bisymmetric matrix with the prescribed eigenvalues and with the prescribed diagonal entries. So in this section we provide a sufficient condition for the BNIEP with the given diagonal entries. We begin this section by proving the following lemma.

Let α0  ≥  α1  ≥  α2 be real numbers and a0,a1 be nonnegative real numbers. Then there is a 3  ×  3 nonnegative bisymmetric matrix with all eignenvalues as α0,α1,α2 and a1,a0,a1 are in the main diagonal entries if and only if there is a j∈{1,2} such that

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

(⇐) It's easy to check that the matrix

[formula]

where [formula], is a 3  ×  3 nonnegative bisymmetric matrix with all eigenvalues as α0,α1,α2.

(⇒  ) Let [formula] have all eigenvalues as α0,α1,α2. Since the sum of all eigenvalues is equal to the trace of the matrix, we have α0  +  α1  +  α2  =  a0 + 2a1. Moreover, by Theorem [\ref=canthm2], Q is orthogonally similar to the matrix

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=canlemma1], α0 is an eigenvalue of [formula] Then a1  -  ξ must be α1 or α2.

Case I: a1  -  ξ  =  α1. Then a1  -  α1  =  ξ  ≥  0 and it implies that a1  ≥  α1 and 2a1  ≥  α1  +  α2. Since the matrix [formula] has eigenvalues α0,α2, its characteristic polynomial x2 - (a0 + a1  +  ξ)x + a0a1 + a0ξ - 2ρ2=x2 - (a0 + 2a1  -  α1)x + 2a0a1 - a0α1 - 2ρ2 is equal to x2 - (α0  +  α2) + α0α2. So,

0 ≤   2ρ2  =  2a0a1 - a0α1  -  α0α2

= (α0  +  α1  +  α2 - a0)a0 - a0α1  -  α0α2

=  α0a0  +  α1a0  +  α2a0 - a20 - a0α1  -  α0α2

=  α0a0  +  α2a0 - a20  -  α0α2

= (α0 - a0)(a0  -  α2).

Since 2a1  ≥  α1  +  α2 and a0 + 2a1  =  α0  +  α1  +  α2, we have α0 - a0  ≥  0. This implies that a0  ≥  α2. This shows that j = 1 satisfies our conditions.

Case II: a1  -  ξ  =  α2. By the similar argument, we have j = 2 satisfies our conditions.

The next two theorems are the main results in this section.

If [formula] are real numbers and [formula] are nonnegative real numbers such that they satisfies all of these conditions;

(1) For each [formula] there is jk∈{2k - 1,2k} such that ak  ≥  λjk and

[formula]

(2) 2ak  ≥  λ2k - 1  +  λ2k, for each [formula], and

(3) [formula] then there is a nonnegative bisymmetric matrix with all eigenvalues as [formula] and with the diagonal entries as [formula]

We prove this theorem by induction on m. If m = 1 then we have [formula]. Moreover, 2a1  ≥  λ1  +  λ2 and λ0  +  λ1  +  λ2 = a0 + 2a1. So, all conditions in lemma [\ref=bidia1] hold.

Next, let m  ≥  2 and suppose the assertion is true for all systems such that M  <  m. Define

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

and           [formula]       [formula]

Now, we show that [formula] satisfy all conditions of the assumption.

(i) For [formula] set [formula]. Obviously, [formula] Moreover,

[formula]

and

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

(ii) For [formula] we have

[formula]

(iii) Obviously, [formula]

Then, by the induction hypothesis, there is a nonnegative bisymmetric matrix A with all eigenvalues as [formula] and its diagonal entries are [formula] [formula] [formula] [formula] [formula]

Now, we show that [formula]. If λj2  =  λ3 then a2  ≥  λ3 and λ0  +  λ1  +  λ2  +  λ3  ≥  2a1 + 2a2. So, λ0  +  λ1  +  λ2 - 2a1  -  λ3  ≥  2a2 - 2λ3  ≥  0. If λj2  =  λ4 then a2  ≥  λ4 and λ0  +  λ1  +  λ2  +  λ4  ≥  2a1 + 2a2. So, λ0  +  λ1  +  λ2 - 2a1  -  λ3  ≥  2a2  -  λ3  -  λ4  ≥  0, by the condition (2).

Finally, let

[formula]

where [formula]. Then it is easy to see that [formula] has all eigenvalues as λ0,λ1,λ2. By Lemma [\ref=lep], show that the matrix

[formula]

where u is a unit eigenvector of A corresponding to [formula] in which Ju = u, has all eigenvalues as [formula]. The sequence of diagonal entries can be permuted by some permutation matrix. This completes the proof.

If [formula] and [formula] and a0 are nonnegative real numbers satisfy all of these conditions;

(1) ai  ≥  λ2i - 1 for [formula],

(2) [formula] ai, for [formula], and

(3) [formula], then there is a nonnegative bisymmetric matrix with all eigenvalues [formula] and with the diagonal entries as am,am - 1, [formula] a0, a0, a1, [formula] am.

We prove the theorem by induction on m. If m = 1 then it is easy to check that the matrix

[formula]

where [formula] is our solution. The induction step is similar to the one in the Theorem [\ref=bidiagonalodd].
