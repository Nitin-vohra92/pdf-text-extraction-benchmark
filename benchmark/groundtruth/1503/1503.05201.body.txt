Introduction

The Epoch of Reionization (EoR) marks a major phase change in the ionization state of the Universe. While the intergalactic medium (IGM) is predominantly composed of neutral Hydrogen () at the beginning of this epoch, it is completely ionized by the end, as a result of ionizing photons produced by both stars and quasars. However, the progress of reionization has been hard to pin down since it depends on a number of parameters including the initial mass function (IMF) of reionization sources, their star formation rates (SFR), their stellar metallicity and age, the escape fraction of ionizing photons produced by each source and the clumping of the intergalactic medium (IGM), to name a few. A further complication is introduced by supernova feedback and (to a lesser extent) the ultraviolet background (UVB) built up during reionization in suppressing the gas content (and hence star formation) in low-mass galaxies which are the main sources of ionizing photons [\citep=barkana-loeb2001] [\citep=ciardi-ferrara2005] [\citep=maio2011] [\citep=sobacchi2013] [\citep=wyithe2013] [\citep=dayal2015].

Lyman Alpha (Lyα) photons are a powerful tool in understanding the ionization state of the IGM given their high optical depth (τ) to [\citep=madau-rees2000]

[formula]

where h is the Hubble parameter, Ωb and Ωm represent the cosmic baryon and matter density, respectively, (1 + δH) is the hydrogen over-density and χHI is the fraction of neutral hydrogen. As seen from this equation, even a neutral hydrogen fraction as low as 10- 5 can lead to a significant attenuation of Lyα  photons at high-z , making them extremely sensitive probes of in the IGM. As a result, a class of high-z  galaxies called Lyman Alpha Emitters (LAEs), detected by means of their Lyα  line (at 1216 Å  in the rest frame), have become popular probes of reionization, with statistically significant samples available in the reionization epoch, at z≃5.7 and 6.6 [\citep=malhotra2005] [\citep=taniguchi2005] [\citep=shimasaku2006] [\citep=hu2010] [\citep=kashikawa2006] [\citep=ouchi2010] [\citep=kashikawa2011]. Indeed, a number of theoretical papers have used semi-analytic [\citep=dijkstra2007] [\citep=dayal2008] [\citep=samui2009] or numerical [\citep=mcquinn2007] [\citep=iliev2008] [\citep=dayal2011] [\citep=forero2011] [\citep=duval2014] [\citep=hutter2014] models to reproduce the observed number counts of LAEs (the Lyα  luminosity function; LF) at various redshifts in the reionization epoch. However interpreting a change in the Lyα  LF is rendered challenging by the fact that the observed Lyα  luminosity depends on: (a) the fraction of ionizing photons (1-fesc ) produced by a galaxy that are able to ionize the interstellar resulting in the Lyα  recombination line, with the rest (fesc ) escaping to ionize the IGM, (b) the fraction of the intrinsic Lyα  photons that can emerge out of the galactic environment unattenuated by dust (fα) and and (c) the fraction of these emergent Lyα  photons that are transmitted (Tα) through the IGM (depending on 〈χHI〉) and reach the observer.

Given these uncertainties, we require an alternative measurement to constrain the ionization state using LAEs. One such strong measure is provided by the two-point angular correlation function (ACF) of LAEs that describes their spatial clustering. Indeed, [\citet=mcquinn2007] have shown that the spatial clustering can hardly be attributed to anything other than the large scale (~   Mpc scale) ionization regions created during reionization. This result is similar to that obtained by [\citet=jensen2014] who find that upcoming large-field LAE surveys should be able to detect the clustering boost for sufficiently high global IGM neutral fractions (20% at z = 6.5), although [\citet=jensen2013] point out that a sample of several thousand objects is needed to obtain a significant clustering signal. Furthermore, [\citet=zheng2010] have shown that Lyα  radiative transfer modifies the ratio of observed and intrinsic Lyα  luminosities depending on the density and velocity structure of the environment, i.e. LOS (transverse) density fluctuations are suppressed (enhanced), leading to a change in the amplitude of the two-point correlation function compared to the case without the environmental selection effect. However, while [\citet=behrens2013] have confirmed a correlation between the observed Lyα  luminosity and the underlying density and velocity field, they do not find a significant deformation of the two-point correlation function by post-processing hydrodynamical simulations with a Lyα  radiative transfer code.

A second probe is presented by the fraction of Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) that show Lyα  emission: given that the physical properties of LBGs do not evolve in the 150 Myrs between z≃6 and 7, a sudden change in the fraction of LBGs showing Lyα  emission could be attributed to reionization [\citep=stark2010] [\citep=stark2011] [\citep=fontana2010] [\citep=pentericci2011] [\citep=caruana2014] [\citep=faisst2014] [\citep=schenker2014] [\citep=tilvi2014]. However, this interpretation is complicated by caveats including the redshift dependence of the relative effects of dust on Lyα  and ultraviolet (UV) continuum photons [\citep=dayal2012] and the fact that simple cuts in EW and UV luminosity may lead to uncertainties in the LAE number densities [\citep=dijkstra2012].

Coupling a cosmological SPH simulation snapshot at z≃6.6 with a radiative transfer (RT) code (pCRASH) and a dust model, [\citet=hutter2014] have shown that the effects of fesc , fα and Tα are degenerate on the LAE visibility: reproducing the observed Lyα  LFs can not differentiate between a Universe which is either completely ionized or half neutral (〈χHI〉≃0.5 - 10- 4), or has an fesc  ranging between 5-50%, or has dust that it either clumped or homogeneously distributed in the interstellar medium (ISM) with fα / fc = 0.6 - 1.8; here fc represents the fraction of UV photons that emerge out of the ISM unattenuated by dust. In this work, we extend our calculations to use the two-point LAE ACF to narrow down the 3-dimensional parameter space of 〈χHI〉, fesc  and fα / fc. Further, we study the time evolution of both the Lyα  and UV luminosities to show the fraction of time during the past 100 Myrs prior to z = 6.6 that a galaxy is visible as a LBG or as a LBG with Lyα emission, both considering the intrinsic and observed (dust and IGM-attenuated) luminosities. In principle, the ratio of these fractions could be measured by relating the number of observed LBGs with Lyα emission to the number of observed LBGs at z = 6.6 - 7.3.

The cosmological model corresponds to the ΛCDM Universe with dark matter (DM), dark energy and baryonic density parameter values of (ΩΛ, Ωm, Ωb) = (0.73, 0.27, 0.047), a Hubble constant H0  =  100h  =  70kms -  1Mpc -  1, and a normalisation σ8 = 0.82, consistent with the results from WMAP5 [\citep=komatsu2009].

The model

In this section we briefly describe our physical model for high-redshift LAEs that couples cosmological SPH simulations run using GADGET-2 with a RT code (pCRASH, [\citet=partl2011]) and a dust model, and interested readers are referred to [\citet=hutter2014] for a detailed description.

The hydrodynamical simulation analysed in this work was carried out with the TreePM-SPH code GADGET-2 and has a box size of 80h- 1 comoving Mpc (cMpc) and contains 10243 DM particles, and initially the same number of gas particles; the mass of a DM and gas particle is [formula] and [formula], respectively. The simulation includes all the standard processes of star formation and its associated metal production and feedback using the prescription of [\citet=springel-hernquist2003b], assuming a Salpeter [\citep=salpeter1955] initial mass function (IMF) between [formula]. Bound structures of more than 20 total (Dark Matter, gas and star) particles are recognised as galaxies using the Amiga Halo Finder [\citep=knollmann2009]. Of all these galaxies, we only use "resolved" galaxies that are complete in the halo mass function in all our calculations - these consist of at least 160 (10) gas (star) particles and have a halo mass [formula]. Assuming each star particle to have formed in a burst, we calculate its spectra, and rest-frame intrinsic Lyα  (Lintα) and UV continuum (Lintλ,c; 1505Å) luminosities depending on the stellar mass, age and metallicity using the population synthesis code STARBURST99 [\citep=leitherer1999]. For each galaxy, the dust mass and its corresponding UV attenuation are calculated using the dust model described in [\citet=dayal2011]. The observed UV specific luminosity is then calculated as Lobsλ,c = fc  ×  Lintλ,c where fc is the fraction of UV photons that emerge out of the ISM unattenuated by dust which is fixed by matching to the observed evolving UV LF at z≃6 - 8; galaxies with an absolute UV magnitude [formula] are then identified as LBGs. The observed Lyα  luminosity (Lobsα) is then calculated as Lobsα  =  fαTαLintα where fα and Tα account for dust attenuation in the ISM and by in the IGM, respectively. Galaxies with Lobsα  ≥  1042 erg s- 1 and EW  =  Lobsα / Lobsλ,c  ≥  20 Å  are identified as LAEs.

Given that both Lintα and 〈χHI〉 depend on the fraction of ionizing photons that can escape out of the ISM (fesc ), we use five values of fesc =0.05,0.25,0.5,0.75,0.95 to post-process the z≃6.6 snapshot of the hydrodynamical simulation with the 3D radiative transfer (pCRASH). To explore the full range of 〈χHI〉 (that determines Tα) we run pCRASH starting from a completely neutral to a completely ionized state and obtain ionization fields for different values of the mean fraction of neutral hydrogen 〈χHI〉; for each galaxy we assume the initial line profile to be Gaussian and compute the average Lyα  transmissions along 48 different lines of sight (LOS). For each combination of fesc and 〈χHI〉 the transmission Tα is then fixed and the only free parameter that can be adjusted to match Lyα  luminosities to observations is the relative escape fraction of Lyα  and UV photons from the ISM, p = fα / fc.

From the Lyα  LFs we find the following trends: the amplitude of the LAE Lyα  LF decreases with increasing fesc due to a decrease in Lintα. However, this decline can be compensated by an increase in either fα / fc or Tα (in an increasingly ionized IGM). Comparing our model Lyα  LFs to observations [\citep=kashikawa2011] we found that allowing for clumped dust ([formula]), the observations can be reproduced for [formula], [formula] and fα / fc = 0.6 - 1.8 within a 1σ error.

Constraints from LAE clustering

Given the sensitivity of Lyα  photons to , the ionization field should be imprinted in the spatial distribution of the LAEs which can be quantified by the two point correlation functions (ACF). In this section, we use the ACF of theoretical LAEs for each of these best-fit combinations (that match the Lyα  LF to within a 1-σ error as summarised in Table [\ref=table_bestfit]) to narrow the joint constraints on 〈χHI〉, fesc  and fα / fc. We start by describing our procedure for obtaining LAE ACFs, which depends both on the depth along the LOS [\citep=peebles1980] since all galaxies are projected to a plane perpendicular to the LOS, as well as the chosen field of view (FoV), which should be comparable to that observed [\citep=kashikawa2006]. Indeed, while the measured ACF should be independent of the FoV if large enough areas are sampled, the restricted observational FoV leads to an ACF that is not independent of sample variance. To get an estimate of the average ACF and its variance, we generate 36 mock catalogues (12 along each of x,y,z directions) for over-lapping volumes comparable to that observed by [\citet=kashikawa2006], corresponding to a redshift distance [formula] at [formula] and a field of view (FoV) of [formula]Mpc2. Using the Landy-Szalay estimator we compute the ACF in each mock survey region denoted by wi(r) with respect to the mean LAE number density [formula] of the complete simulation box and estimate the mean value of w(r) as well as its variance from our mock catalogues as

[formula]

We start by calculating the LBG ACF (over the entire box) to get an estimate of the underlying galaxy population. As seen from Fig. [\ref=fig_LAEclustering], LBGs are almost homogeneously distributed and the ACF is consistent with essentially no clustering on scales [formula] Mpc. On the other hand, the LAE ACF is affected both by ISM dust, as well as the large scale topology of reionization. It might be expected that in the early stages of reionization, only those galaxies that are clustered and hence capable of building large regions would be visible as LAEs (leading to a large amplitude of the ACF), with the amplitude of the ACF decreasing as reionization progresses and faint objects are able to transmit enough flux through the IGM to be visible as LAEs. Indeed, as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig_LAEclustering], LAEs exhibit precisely this behaviour. For a given fesc value (we remind the reader this corresponds to a fixed Lintα), as the IGM becomes more ionized (going down the vertical columns in the Fig. [\ref=fig_LAEclustering]), smaller galaxies are able to transmit more of their flux through the IGM, requiring lowering fα / fc values to fit the Lyα  LF. While for a half neutral IGM (panel a), only strongly clustered galaxies are visible as LAEs (w(r)≃4.5) at scales of ≃2h- 1Mpc, Tα increases for a completely ionized IGM at the same scale, leading to a more homogeneous LAE distribution resulting in a lower amplitude of the ACF (panel m; w(r)≃1.5).

At a given value of 〈χHI〉, Lintα decreases with increasing fesc (horizontal rows in the same figure) which must be compensated by an increase in fα / fc. However, this compensation results in very similar ACFs at a given 〈χHI〉  value. Our results therefore show that the ACF is driven by the reionization topology (as determined by 〈χHI〉), with fesc and the local fα / fc having a marginal effect (a factor of about 1.5) on its amplitude.

We then calculate the χ2 errors between our simulated ACFs and observations, and find that observations constrain [formula] for fesc  =  0.05, 0.5 and [formula] for fesc  =  0.25 (to within a 3σ error). Further, while the fα / fc ratio is compatible with homogeneously distributed dust for fesc = 0.05, the decrease in Lintα requires clumped dust (fα / fc  ≥  0.7) for fesc = 0.25 and 0.5.

To highlight the importance of the spatial clustering of LAEs, we show the (1 - 5)σ constraints allowed by matching the Lyα  LFs to observations in Fig. [\ref=fig_LAE_chi]. As seen, these encompass a region such that 〈χHI〉≃10- 4 - 0.5, fesc = 0.05 - 0.5 and fα / fc = 0.6 - 1.8. However, building ACFs for each of these allowed combinations, we find that theory and observations yield much tighter constraints of 〈χHI〉≃0.01 - 10- 4, fesc = 0.05 - 0.5 and fα / fc = 0.6 - 1.2 to within a 3σ error.

Finally, our results show that it is the reionization topology (as parameterised by 〈χHI〉) that drives the ACF, supporting the results obtained by [\citet=mcquinn2007], [\citet=jensen2013] and [\citet=jensen2014]. Although [\citet=jensen2014] have assumed a simple scaling down of the Lα  luminosity of all galaxies by a fixed amount due to galaxy evolution, they also find that galaxies are more likely to be observed as LAEs if they reside in ionized regions for [formula]. We note that the number of galaxies we identify as LAEs is similar to within 10% for the different fesc, 〈χHI〉 and fα / fc combinations, demonstrating that the enhanced LAE clustering in our model can be attributed to an increasing neutral IGM.

We note that the average number of LAEs in our mock catalogues ([formula]) exceeds the number of identified objects in [\citet=kashikawa2006]. In order to compare to a complete sample we have considered all galaxies with [formula]erg s- 1 and [formula]Å  as LAEs. Since this luminosity cut may include fainter galaxies than observed, the obtained ACFs represent a lower limit, as the clustering increases for higher luminosity cuts [\citep=jensen2014]. According to [\citet=jensen2013] our galaxy sample size of [formula] is sufficient to distinguish a half-ionized from an ionized IGM, but does not provide the necessary sample size of [formula] to distinguish 〈χHI〉 = 0.25 from 〈χHI〉 = 1. However, we have modelled the luminosity of each galaxy according to its stellar population obtained from the hydrodynamical simulation. This makes our results more sensitive to the ionization state of the IGM than [\citet=jensen2013]; their clustering signal was reduced by the random scatter they added to the imposed fixed mass-to-light ratio. Hence, in agreement with [\citet=mcquinn2007] we find our sample size sufficient to distinguish 〈χHI〉 = 0.25 from 〈χHI〉 = 10- 4.

The relation between LAEs and LBGs

In this section we show how simulated z≃6.6 galaxies build up their stellar mass (M*), and the time evolution of their UV and Lyα  luminosities, and Lyα  equivalent widths (EW). We then present the fraction of time during the last 100 Myrs prior to z = 6.6 for which galaxies of different UV magnitudes are visible as LBGs or as LBGs with detectable Lyα  emission, both considering intrinsic and observed luminosities for each combination of fesc, 〈χHI〉  and fα / fc that reproduces the Lyα  LF and LAE ACF within 1σ and 3σ respectively. In order to consider a time span independent of resolution effects we have chosen a period of time of 100 Myrs as an interval. We discuss the limiting case, i.e. considering the total lifetime of each galaxy in our simulation as the corresponding period of time, in the Appendix [\ref=a1].

Time evolution of stellar mass, Lyα and UV luminosities

We use the ages of each star particle to trace the growth of M*, and the metallicity and time dependent values of the intrinsic UV and Lyα  luminosities (Lintλ,c and Lintα, respectively) and the intrinsic Lyα  EW (=  Lintα / Lintλ,c) for galaxies in three bins of [formula]. We assume that all ionizing photons emitted within galaxies are absorbed in the ISM and produce Lyα  radiation, i.e. fesc = 0, to investigate the most extreme case.

As seen from the upper three panels of Fig. [\ref=fig_hist_sources], both Lintλ,c and Lintα (averaged over the galaxies in the given M* bin) rise as galaxies steadily build up in (stellar) mass, albeit with a large scatter reflecting the assembly history of different galaxies. As expected for normal star forming galaxies, the average intrinsic Lyα  EW for all the three M* bins considered here has a value between 30 - 300Å  (lower 3 panels of the same figure) that is larger than the minimum value of 20Å  used to identify LAEs. Indeed, we find that once a galaxy exceeds a critical mass of roughly [formula], it can produce enough luminosity to intrinsically be a LAE (LBG), it has also met the LBG criterion.

As for observed luminosities, we remind the reader that we compute Lobsα using the fraction of UV photons that escape out of the galaxy (fc); Lobsα is computed assuming homogeneously distributed dust (fα / fc = 0.68) and an IGM transmission value of Tα  =  0.45 [\citep=hutter2014]. As expected, including the effects of dust and the IGM reduces both the Lyα  and UV luminosities, as shown in the middle panels of the same figure so that the critical M* at which a galaxy has the minimum luminosity to be a LAE (LBG) increases to [formula], although in most cases the observed EW is still larger than the minimum required value of 20Å  (bottom most panels).

As expected from our discussion above, the time a galaxy spends as a LBG or LAE increases with increasing M*. However, in our model a galaxy becomes a LBG before it also turns into a LAE because of the more stringent (luminosity + EW) constraints imposed on identifying a galaxy as a LAE, as expected from the critical M* values quoted above. To quantify, while galaxies with stellar masses of [formula] are visible as LBGs for roughly the last 80 Myrs, they do not meet the selection criterion to be visible as LAEs: although their intrinsic EW are larger than the minimum value of 20 Å required by observations (bottom panel of same figure), Lintα does not meet the required Lyα  luminosity of 1042 erg s- 1. Galaxies with [formula] are massive enough to sustain star formation and maintain Lintλ,c and Lintα values above the required limits. Again, the lifetime spent as a LAE is driven by Lintα, with the intrinsic EW always exceeding 20 Å (bottom panel of Fig. [\ref=fig_hist_sources]).

When considering observed luminosities, the time a galaxy is visible as a LBG decreases; the decrease is more pronounced for LAEs that are additionally affected by IGM transmission. From panels (d)-(f) of Fig. [\ref=fig_hist_sources], we see that in addition to galaxies with [formula], galaxies with [formula] are also no longer visible as LAEs as a result of the Lyα  luminosity dropping below visible limits.

The fraction of time spent as LBG and as LBG with Lyα  emission

We now calculate the fraction of time during the last 100 Myrs prior to z = 6.6 that galaxies in different UV magnitude bins spend as a LBG (fLBG) and as a LBG with Lyα  emission (fLBGα, i.e. as a LAE), and discuss the resulting fractions (fLBGα and fLBG) for galaxies of varying UV magnitudes MUV  =   - 18 to - 25 in more detail. We start with intrinsic UV luminosities as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig_bestfit_fractions_MUV_int]: firstly, as galaxies become more massive, they are able to sustain large rates of star formation, leading to MUV values that scale with M*. Secondly, we find that both fLBG and fLBGα increase with an increase in the UV magnitude (or M*), as explained in Sec. [\ref=subsec_Lya_UV] above: fLBG increases from 65% to 100% as M* increases from [formula]. As a result of the stricter luminosity and EW criterion imposed to identify galaxies as LAEs, fLBGα < fLBG and declines more rapidly than fLBG towards fainter UV luminosities, decreasing from 100% to 10-30% as M* decreases from [formula]. Further, the decrease in Lintα with increasing fesc  results in a (linear) decrease in fLAE as shown from panels (a)-(c) of the same figure: while fLAE is comparable for fesc = 0.05,0.25, it decreases by about 0.15 for fesc = 0.5, where half of the ionizing photons do not contribute to the Lyα  luminosity thereby reducing the fraction of time it shows Lyα  emission.

We then calculate fLBG and fLBGα including the effects of dust and IGM attenuation for each of the best-fit parameter combinations that match both the observed Lyα  LF and ACF as shown in Sec. [\ref=sec_LAE_clustering]. We use the fc value for each galaxy according to its final dust mass at [formula], the Lyα  transmission Tα of each galaxy was obtained from the ionization field and the ratio of the escape fractions of Lyα  and UV continuum photons (fα / fc) was set according to Table [\ref=table_bestfit]. As can be seen from Fig. [\ref=fig_bestfit_fractions_MUV] (since fLBGα is nearly identical for all best fit cases, we show only one best fit case) the additional attenuation by dust in the ISM and neutral hydrogen in the IGM leads to a rise of the mean stellar mass in each MUV bin, as well as to lower values for fLBGα (compared to the intrinsic case) but not for fLBG. Nevertheless, we find the same trends as when considering intrinsic luminosities: fLBG always exceeds fLBGα, and fLBG and fLBGα decrease towards fainter UV luminosities with fLBGα declining more rapidly. However the relative difference between fLBG and fLBGα is larger and the decline of fLBGα is more rapid: while fLBG decreases from 100% to 65% as MUV increases from -23.5 to -18.5, fLBGα drops from 100% to essentially 0 for the same magnitude range. The stronger decline in fLBGα is not only due to the additional dust- and IGM attenuation of the Lyα  luminosities, but also due to the additional selection criterion in Lyα  equivalent width which becomes more important towards UV fainter galaxies.

We also find that the decrease in fesc is compensated by the increase in fα / fc, leading to very similar fLBG,α ratios for all the models; note that the IGM is almost ionized in most cases, leading to similar Tα values. This clearly shows that 〈χHI〉, fesc and fα / fc compensate each other [\citep=hutter2014], as a result of which fLBGα only depends on the combination of the parameters but not on their individual values.

Thus in our model, the most luminous (massive) LBGs most often show Lyα  emission, irrespective of whether intrinsic or observed luminosities are considered.

Discussion & Conclusions

We couple a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation (GADGET-2) with a dust model and a radiative transfer code (pCRASH) to model high-z LAEs. Starting from a neutral IGM, we run pCRASH until the IGM is completely ionized, for fesc values ranging from 0.05 to 0.95. In [\citet=hutter2014], we showed that comparing model results to Lyα  LF observations simultaneously constrains the escape fraction of ionizing photons fesc, the mean amount of neutral hydrogen 〈χHI〉  and the ratio of the escape fractions of Lyα  photons and UV continuum photons fα / fc to 〈χHI〉≃10- 4 - 0.5, fesc = 0.05 - 0.5 and fα / fc = 0.6 - 1.8. In this paper, we calculate the ACFs for these different combinations and find that comparing these to observations significantly narrows the allowed 3D parameter space (within a 3σ error) to 〈χHI〉≃0.01 - 10- 4, fesc = 0.05 - 0.5 and fα / fc = 0.6 - 1.2. While the effects of these three parameters are degenerate on the Lyα  LFs, the ACF is most sensitive to large-scale ionization topologies and reionization leaves clearly distinguishable ACF imprints (boosting up the strength of the ACF) that can not be compensated by varying fesc or fα / fc. Further, the ACF allows us to constrain [formula], independent of the other two parameters, and we also constrain [formula] and [formula].

We then analyse the average time evolution of UV and Lyα  luminosities of simulated galaxies at z≃6.6 in three bins of [formula], finding the following: as soon as a galaxy exceeds a critical stellar mass of [formula], its intrinsic Lyα  (UV) luminosity is large enough for it to be identified as a LAE (LBG). Including the effects of dust and IGM attenuation naturally results in an increase in this critical mass to 109.5 and [formula] for LAEs and LBGs respectively.

Considering the fraction of time during the last 100 Myrs (prior to z = 6.6) a galaxy spends as a LBG with Lyα  emission (fLBGα) or as a LBG (fLBG), we find that the former is always smaller due to the more stringent luminosity and EW constraints imposed on identifying galaxies as LAEs. We find that both the intrinsic and dust-attenuated fraction fLBGα and fLBG rise with increasing UV luminosity (and hence M*): intrinsically, fLBG (fLBGα) increases from 65% to 100% (10-30% to 100%) as M* increases from [formula]. As expected, including the effects of dust and IGM transmission reduces the values for fLBGα such that fLBGα decreases from 100% to essentially 0 as M* decreases from [formula]. Finally, we find that the fraction fLBGα of all our models that reproduce the observed Lyα  LF and LAE ACFs are independent of the chosen set of parameters: a larger fα / fc compensates a decrease in Tα, or an increase in fesc. As a result, fLBGα only depends on the combination of these 3 parameters but not on their individual values. Thus, it is most often the most luminous LBGs that are visible in the Lyα .

Finally, we summarise the major caveats involved in this study. Firstly, given the cosmological volumes probed by the simulation, we are unable to resolve Lyman Limit systems (LLS) which could lead to a further decrease in the transmission Tα along lines of sight (LOS) intercepted by such systems [\citep=bolton_haehnelt2013]. However, whether LLS are preferentially located in clustered regions, leading to an increasing suppression of Tα for massive galaxies remains an open question.

Secondly, as a natural consequence of simulating cosmological volumes we are unable to resolve the ISM of individual galaxies, for which reason we assume a Gaussian profile (with a width set by the rotation velocity of the galaxy) for the Lyα line that emerges out of any galaxy which is probably an unrealistic scenario [\citep=verhamme2008]. We note that our constraint on the ionization state of the IGM is model dependent, since the IGM Lyα  transmission is sensitive to the the assumed line profile [\citep=jensen2013].

Thirdly, we assume dust attenuation and IGM transmission to be equal to the values at [formula] in order to calculate both fLBGα and fLBG. While the dust mass (and hence attenuation) would be expected to be lower at earlier times, tracing this buildup would require tracking the dust growth in the progenitors of our simulated galaxies. This is beyond the scope of our present paper and we defer to this analysis to a work that is in preparation. Fourthly, fLBGα would be expected to decrease with increasing z as a result of an increase in 〈χHI〉  (leading to a decrease in Tα). However, properly accounting for the latter effect requires modelling the entire history of reionization.

While we have explored the full range of possible values for fesc, its mass and z-dependence remain poorly understood, which is also one of the main caveats involved in modelling the time-evolution of reionization. An increase in fesc with decreasing mass [\citep=ferrara2013] would suppress the visibility of low-mass objects, and strongly impact the reionization fields we generate, emphasising the strong clustering of high-mass halos [\citep=kaiser1984] [\citep=bardeen1986] [\citep=mo_white1996], whilst depressing the LF at the faint end. Bringing these values into agreement with observations would then require an fα / fc ratio that decreases with increasing mass. With its observations of the ionization topology, instruments such as LoFAR will be invaluable in answering some of these outstanding questions.

Finally, we calculate the fraction of LBGs that would be identified as LAEs, XLAE. Imposing a LAE selection criterion of [formula]erg s- 1 and [formula]Å  we find that it is the faintest LBGs that do not show Lyα emission [\citep=dayal2012], while all LBGs brighter than MUV  ~   - 20 are identified as LAEs at [formula] (see Fig. [\ref=fig_MUV_fracLAE]). Even if the Lyα selection criterion is made more stringent, i.e. EW > 55Å, XLAE does not show the behaviour observed by [\citet=stark2010], increasing instead of decreasing with UV magnitude. This mis-match is probably due to a combination of the following effects: firstly, the Lyα IGM transmission (Tα) is subject to a large variance along different lines of sight (LOS) [\citep=hutter2014] due to the patchy nature of reionization; while we use Tα values averaged over 48 LOS, using values along a specific LOS would lead to an over- or underestimate of Tα. Secondly, as mentioned before, it is possible that the inclusion of LLS could decrease Tα of massive galaxies, leading to lower Lyα  EW values respectively. Thirdly, the results by [\citet=stark2010] are based on a post-reionization sample of galaxies (4.5 < z < 6.0), while our simulation samples the end of reionization era. The evolution of the UV (and Lyα ) LFs of LAEs and LBGs suggest that the emitted observable Lyα  radiation varies with cosmic epoch, depending predominantly on the evolution of dust and gas at z < 6 and on the IGM neutral hydrogen fraction at z > 6. Thus, the probe of LBGs with/without Lyα emission in [\citet=stark2010] (dusty, ionized IGM) may differ to the LBG and LAE population at the end of reionization (less dusty, partly neutral IGM). Indeed, a remarkable high fraction of strong LAEs among 6.0 < z < 6.5 luminous LBGs (- 21.75 < MUV <  - 20.25) [\citep=curtislake2012] indicates that most LBGs are also identified as LAEs, which is in agreement with our findings. However, their sample suffers from low statistics, which will be overcome by upcoming Subaru/HST/UltraVISTA data. Finally, as an observational caveat, [\citet=verhamme2012] have shown that detailed Lyα radiative transfer calculations of simulated galaxies suggest stronger inclination effects for Lyα photons than for UV continuum photons, introducing biases in the selection function of narrow-band LAE surveys that could lead to a significant fraction of LBGs galaxies being missed as LAEs. We aim at investigating these effects in detail in future works and shedding light on the tantalising connection between LBGs visible/invisible as LAEs.

The fraction of lifetime spent as LBG with and without Lyα emission

We also show results for the limiting case where the age is the time since the onset of star formation, showing how the fractions of lifetime change when the time span is increased. We take the total age of a galaxy as the time between the formation of the first star and z = 6.6, and calculate the corresponding fractions of lifetime that galaxies in different MUV bins spend as a LBG and as a LBG with Lyα  emission (fLBG and fLBGα, respectively). As described in Section [\ref=subsec_duty_cycle], we compute the fractions of lifetime for our best fit models (see Table [\ref=table_bestfit]) and show the fractions for the fesc = 0.5, [formula] and fα / fc best fit case in Fig. [\ref=fig_bestfit_fractions_MUV_total]. We note that the fractions fLBGα of all other best fit cases are nearly identical to the shown one. Compared to the fractions derived for a time span of 100 Myrs, the fractions of the total lifetime decrease for all UV luminosities. Galaxies that have been identified as LBGs or LBGs with Lyα emission within 100 Myrs prior to z = 6.6 have been fainter at earlier times where they have not met the selection criteria. The decrease in fLBG and fLBGα illustrates the growth of stellar mass in galaxies with time and the existence of a critical stellar mass above which a galaxy produces enough luminosity to be identified as a LBG or as a LBG with Lyα emission. However, we like to note that the point in time when the first star forms depends on the resolution of the simulation, making our fractions of lifetime resolution-dependent but showing their trends as the time span is increased.
