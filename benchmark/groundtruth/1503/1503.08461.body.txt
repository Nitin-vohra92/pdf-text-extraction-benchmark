Noncompact Groups of Inner Type and Factorization

{2000 Mathematics Subject Classifications: 22E67}

Introduction

Given a semisimple Lie algebra [formula] over [formula], write [formula] for the complexification [formula] of [formula] and let G denote the simply connected complex Lie group with Lie algebra [formula]. Let M denote the connected subgroup of G with Lie algebra [formula]. This paper concerns the decomposition of M induced from a Birkhoff decomposition of G. More specifically, fix a triangular decomposition [formula] (which is compatible with [formula] in a sense described below). With [formula], [formula], and W = NG(H) / H, we obtain a Birkhoff decomposition of G

[formula]

and we are interested in the induced decomposition of M

[formula]

The case where [formula] is of compact type is well-known. Assume that the triangular decomposition is compatible with [formula] in the sense that [formula] is maximal abelian in [formula]. In this event each component ΣUw is connected and diffeomorphic to a product of an affine space with the compact torus [formula]. A reinterpretation of (Bott-Samelson or Soibelman or) Lu coordinates on Schubert cells in U / T (see [\cite=Lu] and chapter 5 of [\cite=CP]) leads to an explicit real-algebraic parameterization of the affine factor by a product of affine planes via a map which depends on a reduced decomposition of w into a product of simple reflections. One of several remarkable features of this parameterization is that for the open dense component ΣU1, the restriction of Haar measure on U factors as a product of explicit measures on each of planar factors together with the Haar measure on T. There is one complex parameter ζτ for each positive root τ, which we call "root subgroup coordinates," and an element t∈T determining g∈ΣU1. When all the roots have the same length, in terms of these parameters, the restriction of Haar measure on U to ΣU1 is given by

[formula]

up to a multiplicative constant.

In this paper, we are mainly interested in the case [formula], a non-compact Lie algebra which is in duality with [formula], in the sense of symmetric space theory. Riemannian symmetric spaces come in dual pairs, one of compact type and one of noncompact type. Given such a pair, there is a diagram of finite dimensional groups

[formula]

where U is the universal covering of the identity component of the isometry group of the compact type symmetric space X≃U / K, G is the complexification of U, and G0  ⊂  G is the isometry group for the dual noncompact symmetric space X0 = G0 / K. The fundamental example is the data determined by the Riemann sphere and the Poincaré disk. For this pair, the diagram ([\ref=fdgroupdiagram]) becomes

[formula]

Throughout this paper we assume that the Cartan involution Θ fixing K in G0 is inner; this is equivalent to a number of other conditions: We also assume that the triangular decomposition of [formula] is Θ-stable.

With these assumptions, we show that the Birkhoff component ΣG0w (when nonempty) is connected and diffeomorphic to a product of a contractible bounded complex domain with the torus T. We then introduce "root subgroup coordinates," which depends on a reduced decomposition of w into a product of simple reflections. A key difference between this non-compact inner case and the compact case is that in the non-compact case roots are of two types: compact and non-compact. Correspondingly, the domain of the parameterization must be altered from a product of affine planes to a product of planes and disks. As in the compact case, for the open dense component ΣG01, Haar measure for G0 is equivalent to a product of explicit measures on the planar and disk factors together with Haar measure for T. There is one complex parameter ζτ for each positive root τ and an element t∈T determining g∈ΣG01. When τ is of compact type, ζτ is unrestricted in [formula], while when τ of non-compact type ζτ is restricted to the unit disk in [formula]. Assuming all roots are of the same length, in terms of these parameters, the restriction of Haar measure to ΣG01 is given by

[formula]

up to a multiplicative constant, where the plus (resp. minus) sign is assigned to ±  |ζτ|2 if τ is of compact (reps. non-compact) type.

Plan of the Paper

Section [\ref=background] establishes the notation used throughout the paper, consolidating the data used to define Birkhoff factorization and root subgroup factorization into one place in the paper for ease of reference. Section [\ref=factorization_section] concerns Birkhoff decomposition for the groups U and G0 and root subgroup coordinates for the contractible factors of ΣUw and ΣG0w. The compact case is relatively well-understood, thanks in large part to Lu (see especially [\cite=Lu]). We review and reinterpret this work, with emphasis on the algorithm for root subgroup factorization (which depends on an ordering of non-inverted roots), and then extend it to define root subgroup coordinates for the affine factor of ΣG0w. The algebra of factorization in the noncompact inner case largely reduces to the compact case, because of the existence of a "block (or coarse) triangular decomposition." However, there is one part of the argument in the non-compact case which is not algebraic: this is in showing that everything in a component ΣG0w has a root subgroup factorization. The paper concludes in Section [\ref=Haarmeasuresection] with the computation of the explicit formula ([\ref=noncompact_Haar_formula]) for the restriction of Haar measure on G0 to ΣG01 in terms of root subgroup coordinates.

Notation and Background

Let [formula] be a simple Lie algebra over [formula] and write [formula] for the complexification [formula] of [formula]. Let G be the simply connected complex Lie group with Lie algebra [formula] and let M denote the connected real subgroup of G with Lie algebra [formula]. In this section, we will establish notation for studying factorization of elements of M relative to a Birkhoff decomposition of G. We are mainly interested in the case [formula], a simple noncompact Lie algebra over [formula], which is equipped with a Cartan involution Θ of inner type.

Data determined by the choice of a Cartan involution

The choice of a Cartan involution Θ on [formula] determines a maximal compact Lie subalgebra [formula] of [formula]. Let σ denote the canonical complex conjugation on [formula] fixing [formula]. If we extend Θ to [formula] in a complex linear fashion then the composition [formula] is a complex conjugation on [formula] fixing a compact real form [formula] of [formula]. The extended involution Θ on [formula] stabilizes [formula] and fixes [formula] inside of [formula]. Thus, [formula]. The assumption that [formula] is of inner type is equivalent to the condition that

[formula]

We write [formula] for the decomposition of [formula] into the eigenspaces of Θ on [formula]. Then [formula] where multiplication by i denotes the canonical complex structure on [formula], and this is the decomposition of [formula] into the eigenspaces of the extension of Θ restricted to [formula].

Let U and K denote the connected subgroups of G having Lie algebras [formula] and [formula]. Then we obtain a diagram of Lie algebras and corresponding connected Lie groups.

[formula]

We will also use Θ to denote the corresponding holomorphic involution of G, and its restrictions to G0 and U, which fixe K in G0 and U, respectively.

Data determined by the choice of a Θ-stable Cartan subalgebra and a Weyl chamber in the Inner Case

Fix a Cartan subalgebra [formula]. Because of our rank assumption ([\ref=rank_condition]), [formula] is a Θ-stable Cartan subalgebra of [formula] and every Θ-stable Cartan subalgebra of [formula] is of this form. In addition, [formula] is a Θ-stable Cartan subalgebra of [formula], and its centralizer [formula] in [formula] is a Θ-stable Cartan subalgebra of [formula]. We write [formula], where [formula], for the eigenspace decomposition of [formula] under Θ and let [formula], [formula], and [formula], respectively.

We will use W: = NU(T) / T as a model for the Weyl group of [formula]. The choice of a Weyl chamber C in [formula] determines a choice of positive roots for the action of [formula] on [formula]. Let [formula] denote the sum of the root spaces indexed by positive roots and [formula] denote the sum of the root spaces indexed by negative roots. In this way, the choice of a Θ-stable Cartan subalgebra [formula] of [formula] and a Weyl chamber C determines a triangular decomposition

[formula]

Set [formula]. Then B+  =  HN+ and B-  =  N-H are a pair of opposite Borel subgroups of G.

A consequence of the stability of [formula] under σ and τ is the fact that [formula] and [formula].

In this paper, a special role is played by the rank 1 example of

[formula]

with Cartan involution given by

[formula]

The complexification is [formula] and the associated compact real form is [formula]. The involution fixing [formula] is X  ↦   - X* (opposite conjugate transpose). The effect of this involution is to negate the off-diagonal entries. In this case, the maximal compact subalgebra fixed by the involution is the one dimensional subalgebra [formula] of diagonal matrices in [formula]. This subalgebra, which is abelian and hence also a Cartan subalgebra, then determines the standard triangular decomposition

[formula]

Root Data

Let θ denote the highest root and normalize the Killing form so that (for the dual form) 〈θ,θ〉 = 2. For each root α let [formula] denote the associated coroot (satisfying α(hα) = 2). The inner type assumption, together with the Θ-stability of [formula], implies that each root space [formula] is contained in either [formula] or in [formula] and thus the roots can be sorted into two types. A root α is of compact type if the root space [formula] is a subset of [formula] and of noncompact type otherwise, i.e., when [formula]. The following is elementary.

Suppose γ is a positive root, and consider the root homomorphism [formula] with ιγ(diag(1, - 1)) = hγ and which carries the standard triangular decomposition of [formula] ([\ref=std_tri_decomp_sl(2] [\ref=C)]) into the triangular decomposition [formula]. Then

[formula];

when γ is of compact type, [formula];

when γ is of noncompact type, [formula].

We denote the corresponding group homomorphism by the same symbol. Note that if γ is of noncompact type, then ιγ induces an embedding of the rank one diagram ([\ref=rankonegroupdiagram]) into the group diagram ([\ref=fdgroupdiagram]). For each simple positive root γ, we use the group homomorphism to set

[formula]

and obtain a specific representative for the associated simple reflection rγ∈W = NU(T) / T corresponding to γ. (We will adhere to the convention of using boldface letters to denote representatives of Weyl group elements).

Birkhoff and Root Subgroup Factorization

By definition, the Birkhoff decomposition of G relative to the triangular decomposition [formula] is

[formula]

If we fix a representative [formula] for w∈W, then each g∈ΣGw can be factored uniquely as

[formula]

This defines functions [formula], m:ΣGw  →  T, a:ΣGw  →  A, and u:ΣGw  →  U. For fixed m0∈T, the subset {g∈ΣGw:m(g) = m0} is a stratum (topologically an affine space). It is therefore sensible and appropriate to refer to ΣGw as the "isotypic component of the Birkhoff decomposition of G corresponding to w∈W." However we may occasionally lapse into referring to ΣGw as the "Birkhoff stratum corresponding to w." We are interested in describing the induced decomposition of G0  ⊂  G.

We say that the elements of ΣG1 have a triangular factorization since then ([\ref=birkhoff2]) reduces to

[formula]

and l(g)∈N-. The factor d(g) can be explicitly computed in terms of root data by the formula

[formula]

where σj(g) = φΛj(πΛj(g)vΛj) is the fundamental matrix coefficient for the highest weight vector corresponding to Λj.

Factorization in the Compact Case

Although we are interested in the case where [formula] is a non-compact simple Lie algebra of inner type, we record here the corresponding results when [formula] is a compact simple Lie algebra for comparison. We will write U for the group M inside of G. Given w∈W, define

[formula]

Fix a representative [formula] for w. For g∈ΣGw the unique factorization ([\ref=birkhoff2]) induces a bijective correspondence

[formula]

For fixed m0∈T, the set {g∈ΣUw:m(g) = m0} is a stratum, and we will refer to ΣUw as the "isotypic component of the Birkhoff decomposition for U corresponding to w∈W." The quotient of ΣUw by T is the usual Birkhoff stratum for the flag space U / T = G / B+ corresponding to w.

We now briefly recall Lu's approach to root subgroup factorization from [\cite=Lu]. This involves the Bruhat decomposition [formula]. A translation of Lu's results over to the Birkhoff decomposition will be given below.

For [formula], we define a function [formula] by

[formula]

Fix w'∈W. Choose a minimal factorization [formula], where each rj is a reflection and write γj for the corresponding simple positive root. Then the map

[formula]

is a bijection.

[formula]

The algorithm for choosing a factorization for w' is the following: choose (a simple positive root) γ1 such that w'  ·  γ1 < 0, determining r1; choose γ2 such that w'r1  ·  γ2 < 0, determining r2; choose γ3 such that w'r1r2  ·  γ3 < 0, determining r3; and so on. The positive roots flipped to negative roots are τj = r1..rj - 1  ·  γj, for j = 1,..,l(w').

A choice of factorization w' = rl(w')..r1 determines a non-repeating sequence of adjacent Weyl chambers

[formula]

where wj': = rj..r1 and the step from (wj - 1')- 1C to (wj')- 1C is implemented by the reflection (wj - 1')- 1rjwj - 1' associated to τj. In particular the wall between (wj - 1')- 1C and (wj')- 1C is fixed by (wj - 1')- 1rjwj - 1'. Conversely, given a sequence of length l(w') of adjacent chambers [formula] from C1 = C to Cl(w') = (w')- 1C then there is a corresponding minimal factorization.

A basic example of a factorization of the longest element of the Weyl group for [formula] is the lexicographic factorization

[formula]

Here λi denotes the functional which selects the ith diagonal entry, the simple positive roots are αi  =  λi  -  λi + 1, and the sequence of roots τ is given by

[formula]

The Bruhat and Birkhoff decompositions (in this finite dimensional context) are related by translation by the unique longest Weyl group element w0, i.e.,

[formula]

where w = w0w'. Since we can choose representatives for w, w0, and w' in U, the same relationship holds on the induced decompositions of U. In terms of this translation, the following lemma describes how to select the sequence of simple positive roots intrinsically in terms of w (without reference to w0 and w').

Fix w∈W.

Choose a sequence of simple positive roots γj in the following way: (1) choose γ1 such that w  ·  γ1 > 0; (2) choose γ2 such that wr1  ·  γ2 > 0; (3) choose γ3 such that wr1r2  ·  γ3 > 0, and so on, where rj is the simple reflection corresponding to γj. Let τj = r1..rj - 1  ·  γj. Then the τj are the positive roots which are mapped to positive roots by w.

This choice of positive roots determines a non-repeating sequence of adjacent Weyl chambers

[formula]

If wj' = rj..r1 then the step from wj - 1'w- 1C to wj'w- 1C is implemented by the reflection rj. Conversely, given a sequence (Cj) of length n = l(w0) - l(w) consisting of adjacent chambers from C1 = w- 1C to Cn =  - C which is minimal, there is a corresponding minimal factorization of w' = w- 10w.

As we noted above, this is equivalent to the more standard procedure of setting w' = w- 10w and choosing a reduced factorization w' = rn..r1 where n = l(w0) - l(w) = l(w').

Fix w∈W(K) and a representative [formula] for w, then determine positive simple roots [formula] with associated simple reflections [formula], and positive roots [formula] as in Lemma [\ref=weylfactorization]. Set [formula] and [formula] for each [formula].

Each g∈ΣUw has a unique factorization of the form

[formula]

for some t∈T and some [formula].

The map

[formula]

is a diffeomorphism.

If [formula] has the factorization in part (a) then the factor a(g) from ([\ref=birkhoff2]) has the product form

[formula]

where [formula] is the function from ([\ref=uofzeta]).

This is a translation of Lu's results. We will essentially reproduce the proof in the next subsection.

Factorization in the Noncompact Inner Case

Now we return to the case where [formula] is a noncompact Lie algebra over [formula] of inner type. Then each root space for [formula] on [formula] is contained either in [formula] or in [formula]. This yields a vector space decomposition

[formula]

where [formula] is spanned by root vectors corresponding to compact type positive roots, and [formula] is spanned by root vectors corresponding to noncompact type positive roots; moreover, [formula] is an abelian ideal of [formula]. Likewise, [formula]. Note that

[formula]

as vector spaces. The sum [formula] is the parabolic subalgebra of [formula] corresponding to the set of simple positive roots of compact type. We denote the corresponding parabolic subgroup of G by [formula].

We refer to the decomposition

[formula]

as a block triangular decomposition of [formula]. For G, the corresponding group-level "block Birkhoff decomposition" is well-known. We will use W(K) = NK(T) / T as a model for the Weyl group of [formula]. Then there is a faithful embedding

[formula]

The components of the "block Birkhoff decomposition" are then indexed by the elements of the quotient W / W(K).

[formula]

and the natural map

[formula]

is a diffeomorphism.

This follows from standard facts about Birkhoff stratification for a generalized flag space; see, for example, the Appendix to [\cite=Pi1].

[formula]

Each g∈G0 has a unique "block triangular factorization"

[formula]

The set D(G0,K) = {lp:g = lpgkup∈G0} is a contractible bounded complex domain in N-p.

Each g∈G0 has a factorization of the form

[formula]

where lp and up are the same factors occurring in part (a), [formula] is a representative for some w∈W(K), ma∈TA, [formula], and uk∈N+k.

Furthermore,

[formula]

For each w∈W(K), if a representative [formula] for w is fixed then the factorization in part (c) is unique and defines functions lp:ΣG0w  →  D(G0,K), [formula], m:ΣG0w  →  T, and induces a diffeomorphism

[formula]

given by g  ↦  (lp(g),lk(g),m(g)).

There is a natural map G0 / K  →  G / P and by Lemma [\ref=first_lemma], G / P is a union of N-p-orbits indexed by w∈W / W(K). The top stratum corresponds to w = 1 in W / W(K) and is parameterized by N-p. Theorem 5 of [\cite=Pi0] shows that this image is contained in the top stratum. This can also be deduced from Lemma 7.9 on page 388 of [\cite=H]. Parts (a) and (b) of the theorem now follow from this observation. This also implies that ΣG0w is empty unless w∈W(K) (since W(K) is the 1 in W / W(K)). Hence part (d) follows from this observation as well.

Part (c) is a consequence of the triangular factorization for [formula] (this is the sense in which triangular factorization for the noncompact inner case reduces to the compact case).

Because of the uniqueness of the factorization in (c), the map in (e) is 1-1. It remains to show the map is onto. Suppose that we are given (lp,lk,t) in the codomain of the map. By definition, there exists g0∈G0 such that g0 = lpgkup. Given k∈K,

[formula]

because K normalizes N+p. Since K acts transitively on the flag space [formula], we can choose k such that gk' has triangular factorization of the form [formula]. We can always multiply on the right by a t' to obtain the desired t without affecting the other factors. This shows the map is onto.

[formula]

The map [formula] given by g  →  gk is a homotopy equivalence.

For each w∈W(K) the map

[formula]

induced by part (c) of Theorem [\ref=first_theorem] is a homotopy equivalence.

We now turn to root subgroup factorization. In the compact case, a special role was played by the function [formula] defined by

[formula]

where [formula]. By composing copies of this function with root homomorphisms, interleaving the compositions into a minimal sequence of simple reflections factoring w, and multiplying out the results we were able to parameterize ΣUw. To accommodate the new situation where the simple reflections may be associated to noncompact type roots, and to parameterize [formula], we define a function [formula] by

[formula]

where [formula].

Fix w∈W(K) and a representative [formula] for w, then determine positive simple roots [formula] with associated simple reflections [formula], and positive roots [formula] as in Lemma [\ref=weylfactorization]. Set [formula] and [formula] for each [formula].

Each g∈ΣG0w has a unique factorization

[formula]

for some t∈T and [formula], where if τj is a noncompact type root, then |ζj| < 1 and g(ζj) = q(ζj) from ([\ref=factor_minus]), and if τj is a compact type root, then ζj is unrestricted in [formula] and g(ζj) = k(ζj) as in ([\ref=factor_plus]).

If g∈ΣG0w has the factorization in part (a) then the factor a(g) of g from part (c) of Theorem [\ref=first_theorem] has the product form

[formula]

where [formula] if τj is a noncompact type root and [formula] if τj is a compact type root.

We must show that the map

[formula]

where g is defined as in part (a), is a diffeomorphism. Here it is understood that if the jth root is of noncompact type, then g(ζj) = q(ζj) and |ζj| < 1, and if the jth root is of compact type, then g(ζj) = k(ζj) and ζj is unrestricted in [formula].

We first calculate the triangular decomposition for

[formula]

by induction on n. In the process we will prove part (b), which will be used in the proof of part (a). First note that since τj = (wj - 1')- 1  ·  γj and ιτj preserves triangular factorizations,

[formula]

is a triangular factorization (the plus/minus case is used for the compact/noncompact root case, respectively). In what follows, we will simply write [formula] for [formula] since the appropriate sign can be inferred from the type of the corresponding root τj.

Suppose that n = 2. Then

[formula]

where ±  j occurs according to whether τj is a compact/noncompact type root, respectively. The key point is that

[formula]

Insert this calculation into ([\ref=n=2case1]). We then see that g(2) has a triangular factorization g(2) = l(2)a(2)u(2), where

[formula]

and

[formula]

Note that with l-factor, the sign difference between the calculations in the compact and noncompact case is only present in the corresponding type of [formula].

To apply induction, we assume that g(n - 1) has a triangular factorization g(n - 1) = l(n - 1)a(n - 1)u(n - 1) with

[formula]

for some [formula], and

[formula]

We have established this for n - 1 = 1,2. For n  ≥  3

[formula]

where [formula]. Now we factor [formula] as [formula], relative to the decomposition

[formula]

and let

[formula]

Then g(n) has triangular decomposition

[formula]

by ([\ref=prod_form_of_a]).

Now suppose that we multiply this triangular decomposition on the left by [formula] (as in part (a)). Because the τj, j = 1,..,n, are the positive roots which are mapped to positive roots by w, it follows that l(n) will be conjugated by [formula] into another element in N-. It follows that g, as defined in part (a), is in ΣG0w.

Now we want to draw some conclusions. First note that the inductive calculation of the triangular decomposition implies part (b) of the Theorem. We can also see that the map ([\ref=openmap]), which has domain a product of disks and affine planes, is 1-1 and open. Because ΣG0w is connected (by Corollary [\ref=topology]), to conclude that the map ([\ref=openmap]) is a diffeomorphism, it suffices to show that the map ([\ref=openmap]) has a closed image in ΣG0w. Suppose that (gk)∞k = 1 is a sequence of elements in the image of ([\ref=openmap]) (these are elements that have root subgroup factorizations), and suppose this sequence converges to g'∈ΣG0w. We must show that g' has a root subgroup factorization. For each k, consider the unique triangular factorization

[formula]

Since g'∈ΣG0w with triangular factorization [formula], [formula], we know that ak  →  a' as k  →    ∞  , and hence the sequence (ak)∞k = 1 is bounded in A.

We now will show that the formula in part (b) for the a-component, applied to each gk (together with a pivotal fact about roots for Hermitian symmetric spaces), implies that the associated sequence of parameters in the domain must remain bounded as k  →    ∞  . This formula can be written as

[formula]

where the αi, 1  ≤  i  ≤  r, are the simple positive roots, for a root γ we write [formula], and the ±   is positive if and only if the corresponding root is of compact type. What we can a priori conclude from this formula is that for each [formula],

[formula]

remains bounded as k  →    ∞  . If all of the signs are the same, then we can conclude that the sequence ζ(k)τj remains bounded (in the plane for a compact type root, and in the disk for a noncompact type root) as k  →    ∞  ; however, if there are mixed signs, then there could be terms going to zero and terms going to infinity which perfectly balance, and we cannot draw any conclusion.

For simplicity we now assume [formula] is simple (otherwise we work with its unique simple components). The basic fact about roots of an irreducible Hermitian symmetric space is that there is exactly one simple root, say φ  =  αr, such that each positive root can be written either as

[formula]

In the first case α is of compact type, and in the second case α is of non-compact type. This follows from Lemma 3 of [\cite=Wolf] (Remark: this fact is the key to Wolf's proof of Cartan's classification of Hermitian symmetric spaces; of course one could also use the classification of such spaces to deduce this as well). For i = r in the preceding paragraph, all of the signs in the product [\ref=keyprod] are negative, and all the τj which are of noncompact type occur in this product. Thus for all of the τj which are of noncompact type, the sequence ζ(k)τj will be bounded in the disk as k  →    ∞  . Once this is established, we can consider i < r and draw the same conclusion for τj of compact type.

We can therefore find a subsequence of the sequence of parameters which converges to an element of the domain (the plane for a compact type root, the disk for a noncompact type root). The sequence gk will then converge to the group element corresponding to this limiting parameter by continuity. This limit must be g', and hence we obtain a root subgroup factorization for g'. This completes the proof.

Haar Measure in Root Subgroup Coordinates

In closing we mention one striking feature of root subgroup factorization, the fact that Haar measure is a product in these coordinates. The analogue of this in the compact case is due to Lu in [\cite=Lu], where she obtains product formulas for Kostant's harmonic forms on [formula], one of which is the invariant volume on [formula]. The argument here is more direct.

With w = 1 and notation as in Theorem [\ref=root_factorization_g0] we obtain a parametrization of the open dense subset [formula] by a product of copies of complex planes and disks, together with the torus T. In terms of the complex parameters (ζj) and [formula] for

[formula]

where g(ζj) = k(ζj) when τj is of compact type (resp. g(ζj) = q(ζj) when τj is of noncompact type), then Haar measure for [formula] is (up to a constant)

[formula]

where [formula] according to whether τj is of compact/noncompact type, and where [formula] denotes Haar measure for [formula].

(a) This formula for Haar measure can alternatively be written as

[formula]

where we choose the plus sign for compact roots, the negative sign for noncompact roots, ζτ is understood to be bounded by one when τ is noncompact, and ζτ  =  ζj when τ  =  τj.

(b) When [formula] is simply laced, δ(hτ) is the height of the positive root τ. Thus in the simply laced case,

[formula]

Denote the triangular decomposition for [formula] by

[formula]

Recall that g is uniquely determined by [formula] and [formula]. The following formula should be attributed to Harish-Chandra:

Up to a normalization

[formula]

where (by slight abuse of notation) it is understood that we are restricting Haar measure for [formula] to the intersection of [formula] with the image of [formula].

This is equivalent to proving the coordinate expression

[formula]

for the invariant measure on the quotient [formula]. The value of the density of [formula] with respect to [formula] at l(g) can be computed as follows. Identify the tangent space to [formula] at l(g) with [formula] by left translation. The derivative at [formula] of left translation by [formula] is then identified with a linear map from [formula] (viewed as the tangent space to [formula] at 1) to [formula] (viewed as the tangent space at l(g)). The reciprocal of the determinant of this map is the value of the density at l(g).

Given [formula], the curve ε  ↦   exp εX represents the corresponding tangent vector at [formula]. Let ε  ↦  g0(ε) denote a lift of this curve to [formula], i.e., l(g0(ε)) =  exp εX. We can arrange for this lift to have m(g0(ε)) = 1 for ε small. Then

[formula]

represents the image of ε  ↦   exp (εX) under left translation by g through these identifications. Let g0(ε) = l(ε)a(ε)u(ε) denote the triangular factorization of g0(ε). Then

[formula]

so the derivative of ([\ref=t_vector]) at ε = 0 is the linear map

[formula]

where (  ·  )- denotes the projection to [formula] along the triangular decomposition [formula]. We claim that the matrix representing ([\ref=derivative_map]) in terms of the basis of negative roots is triangular. Indeed, if [formula] is homogeneous of a given height then [formula] where X'(g) is a sum of terms of strictly greater height than that of X because u(g)∈N+ and thus [formula] is unipotent. Therefore, [formula] where again X''(g) is a sum of terms of height strictly greater than [formula] since a(g)∈A. Thus, the determinant of ([\ref=derivative_map]) as a real linear transformation is a(g) raised to twice the sum of the negative roots, i.e., [formula]. Taking the reciprocal gives the desired formula for the density.

In the ζ coordinates

[formula]

where a sign is positive if and only if the corresponding root is of compact type.

With the same conventions as in Remark [\ref=haarremark], the formula in Lemma [\ref=nillemma] can be alternatively written as

[formula]

In a similar way

[formula]

Together with Lemma [\ref=haarlemma], these formulas immediately imply Theorem [\ref=haartheorem] (as formulated in Remark [\ref=haarremark]).

The basic idea of the proof of Lemma [\ref=nillemma] is the following. If we write [formula], then there is a triangular relationship between the ζ variables and the x variables which is implicit in the proof of Theorem [\ref=root_factorization_g0]. To carefully prove this, we need to go back through the induction argument in that proof. This involves an algebraic lemma and a more technical statement.

For [formula],

[formula]

Recall wn - 1 = rn - 1..r1. Since τn = w- 1n - 1  ·  γn, and Inv(wn - 1) = {τk:k < n}, the lemma is equivalent to

[formula]

or

[formula]

The left hand side is δ applied to a simple coroot, hence it equals one. This completes the proof.

Suppose that [formula]. As in the statement and proof of Theorem [\ref=root_factorization_g0] (with w = 1), let g(n) = iτn(g(ζn))..iτ1(g(ζ1)). Then [formula] and the expression for Haar measure of this nilpotent group, in the ζ coordinates, is given by

[formula]

up to a normalization, where a sign is positive if and only if the corresponding root is of compact type.

If n = 2, then by ([\ref=2ndcase1]),

[formula]

Together with Lemma [\ref=alglemma], this completes the proof for n = 1,2.

Now suppose n > 2 and the result holds for n - 1. We need to revisit how we obtained l(g(n)), beginning after line ([\ref=induction1]) in the induction step for the proof of Theorem [\ref=root_factorization_g0]. Recall that

[formula]

where [formula], and [formula]. The first term will be the first factor in the ultimate expression for l(g(n)). The conjugation by a(ζn)hτn will affect volume, and we will consider this below. The last term does not affect l(g(n)). Consider the product of the other terms, which we rewrite as

[formula]

by inserting the identity. Since conjugation by [formula] is a group isomorphism from the lower triangular nilpotent group

[formula]

to the upper triangular nilpotent group [formula] (where [formula] lives) the Haar measure for the first is pushed to the Haar measure for the second. We now consider the decomposition

[formula]

and we write u = (u)1(u)2 for the corresponding factorization of elements [formula].

The key fact is that, if we set u0  =   exp (  ±  neγn), then the map

[formula]

preserves the invariant volume. To see this, trivialize the tangent bundle for the nilpotent group [formula] using left translation, and fix u. Then derivative for the map ([\ref=volume_preserving_map]) at u is identified with the linear transformation

[formula]

given by

[formula]

Now,

[formula]

because the factor map (  ·  )1 is equivariant for left multiplication by the first factor group [formula] and invariant for right multiplication by the second factor group [formula]. Consequently, ([\ref=derivative_of_volume_preserving_map]) becomes

[formula]

where (  ·  )1 now denotes the infinitesimal projection to [formula] in [formula]. Since [formula], this is clearly the compression of a unipotent map on [formula]. Hence, its determinant is 1 at each point u.

Note that

[formula]

because exp (  ±  neγn) is in the second factor of the nilpotent group decomposition. We finally have

[formula]

where

[formula]

When we conjugate by the factor [formula], we are multiplying the coefficient of fτj by a factor [formula]. Using the induction step, this implies that the Haar measure in the statement of the Lemma is of the form

[formula]

Applying Lemma [\ref=alglemma] to the first product completes the proof.
