Some singular minimizers in low dimensions in the calculus of variations

Introduction

In this paper we consider minimizers of functionals of the form

[formula]

where [formula] is a map from [formula] to [formula] and F is a smooth, uniformly convex function on Mm  ×  n with bounded second derivatives. By a minimizer we understand a map [formula] for which the integral above increases after we perform any smooth deformation of [formula], with compact support in B1. If F satisfies these conditions then minimizers are unique subject to their own boundary condition. Moreover [formula] is a minimizer if and only if it solves the Euler-Lagrange system

[formula]

in the sense of distributions.

The regularity of minimizers of [\eqref=Functional] is a well-studied problem. Morrey [\cite=Mo] showed that in dimension n  =  2 all minimizers are smooth. This is also true in the scalar case m  =  1 by the classical results of De Giorgi and Nash [\cite=DG1],[\cite=Na]. In the scalar case, the regularity is obtained by differentiating equation [\eqref=MinimizerEquation] and treating the problem as a linear equation with bounded measurable coefficients. An example of De Giorgi [\cite=DG2] shows that these techniques cannot be extended to the case m  ≥  2. Another example due to Giusti and Miranda [\cite=GM2] shows that elliptic systems do not have regularity even when the coefficients depend only on [formula]. On the other hand it is known that minimizers of [\eqref=Functional] are smooth away from a closed singular set of Hausdorff n - p dimensional measure zero for some p  >  2, see [\cite=GM1], [\cite=GG]. (In fact, if F is uniformly quasi-convex then minimizers are smooth away from a closed set of Lebesgue measure zero, see Evans [\cite=E2]). However, the singular set may be non-empty. We will discuss some interesting examples below.

The main result of this paper is a counterexample to the regularity of minimizers of [\eqref=Functional] when n  =  3 and m  =  2, which are the optimal dimensions in light of the previous results. The existence of such minimizing maps from [formula] to [formula] or from [formula] to [formula] is stated as an open problem in the book of Giaquinta (see [\cite=Gi], p. 61).

The first example of a singular minimizer of [\eqref=Functional] is due to Neas [\cite=Ne]. He considered the homogeneous degree one map

[formula]

from [formula] to [formula] for n large, and constructed explicitly a smooth uniformly convex F on Mn2  ×  n for which [formula] minimizes [\eqref=Functional]. Later Hao, Leonardi and Neas [\cite=HLN] improved the dimension to n  =  5 using

[formula]

The values of [\eqref=SYExample] are symmetric and traceless, and thus lie in a n(n + 1) / 2  -  1 dimensional subspace of Mn  ×  n. verák and Yan [\cite=SY1] showed that the map [\eqref=SYExample] is a counterexample for n = 3,  m = 5. Their approach is to construct a quadratic null Lagrangian L which respects the symmetries of [formula], such that [formula] on [formula] for some smooth, uniformly convex F on M5  ×  3. The Euler-Lagrange system [formula] then holds automatically. In [\cite=SY2] they use the same technique to construct a non-Lipschitz minimizer with n  =  4,  m = 3 coming from the Hopf fibration. To our knowledge, these are the lowest-dimensional examples to date.

Our strategy is different and it is based on constructing a homogenous of degree one minimizer in the scalar case for an integrand which is convex but has "flat pieces".

An interesting problem about the regularity of minimizers occurs in the scalar case when considering in [\eqref=Functional] convex integrands [formula] for which the uniform convexity of F fails on some compact set S. Assume for simplicity that F is smooth outside the degeneracy set S, and also that F satisfies the usual quadratic growth at infinity. One key question is whether or not the gradient [formula] localizes as we focus closer and closer to a point x0∈B1. In [\cite=DS] it was proved that, in dimension n = 2, the sets [formula] decrease uniformly as ε  →  0 either to a point outside S, or to a connected subset of S. In Theorem [\ref=ScalarExample] below we show that this "continuity property" of [formula] does not hold in dimension n = 3 when the set S is the union of two disconnected convex sets. We remark that, as in the p-Laplace equation, it is relatively standard (see [\cite=E1] [\cite=CF]) to obtain the continuity of [formula] outside the convex hull Sc of S.

Let w be the homogeneous degree one function

[formula]

and let u0 be the function on [formula] obtained by revolving w around the x1 axis,

[formula]

We show that u0 solves a degenerate elliptic equation that is uniformly elliptic away from the cone

[formula]

For any δ  >  0 there exists a convex function [formula] which is linear on two bounded convex sets containing [formula], uniformly convex and smooth away from these two convex sets, such that u0 is a minimizer of the functional

[formula]

We use u0 and G0 to construct a singular minimizing map from [formula] to [formula]. Rescaling u0 we obtain a function u1 that solves an equation that is uniformly elliptic away from a thin cone around the x1 axis, and switching the x1 and x3 axes we get an analogous function u2. Then [formula] is a minimizing map for

[formula]

which is a convex function defined on [formula]. Notice that the Euler-Lagrange system [formula] is de-coupled, and F0 fails to be uniformly convex or smooth in certain regions. However, a key observation is that F0 separates quadratically from its tangent planes when restricted to the image of [formula]. We obtain our example by making a small perturbation of F0.

More specifically, let

[formula]

and let

[formula]

Our main theorem is:

The map [\eqref=MainExample] is a minimizer of

[formula]

for some smooth, uniformly convex [formula].

The paper is organized as follows. In Section [\ref=MainProof] we state a convex extension lemma and the key proposition, which asserts the existence of a suitable smooth small perturbation of G0. We then use them to prove Theorem [\ref=main]. In Section [\ref=Constructions] we prove the key proposition. This section contains most of the technical details. In Section [\ref=Appendix] we prove the extension lemma and some technical inequalities needed for the key proposition. Finally, at the end of Section [\ref=Appendix] we outline how to prove Theorem [\ref=ScalarExample].

Key Proposition and Proof of Theorem [\ref=main]

In this section we state the extension lemma and the key proposition. We then use them to prove Theorem [\ref=main].

The function F0 defined in the Introduction is not uniformly convex in M2  ×  3, but it separates quadratically from its tangent planes on the image of D which, by the one-homogeneity of [formula], is the two dimensional surface [formula]. The quadratic separation holds on this surface since G1 is uniformly convex in the region where G2 is flat and vice versa. We would like to find a uniformly convex extension of F0 with the same tangent planes on [formula].

Extension Lemma

The extension lemma gives a simple criterion for deciding when the tangent planes on a smooth surface can be extended to a global smooth, uniformly convex function. Let Σ be a smooth compact, embedded surface in [formula] of any dimension.

Let G be a smooth function and [formula] a smooth vector field on Σ such that

[formula]

for any x,  y∈Σ and some γ  >  0. Then there exists a global smooth function F such that F  =  G and [formula] on Σ, and D2F  ≥  γI.

The idea of the proof is to first make a local extension by adding a large multiple of the square of distance from Σ. We then make an extension to all of [formula] by taking the supremum of tangent paraboloids to the local extension. Finally we mollify and glue the local and global extensions. We postpone the proof to the appendix, Section [\ref=Appendix]. We also record an obvious corollary.

Let G be a smooth function on an open subset O of [formula]. We define the separation function SG on O  ×  O by

[formula]

Assume that G is a smooth function in a neighborhood of Σ such that SG(x,y)  ≥  γ|y - x|2 for any x,  y∈Σ and some γ  >  0. Then there exists a global smooth, uniformly convex function F such that F  =  G and [formula] on Σ.

Key Proposition

In this section we state the key proposition. We first give the setup for the statement. Recall that [formula]. Let

[formula]

We describe Γ as a collection of four congruent curves. The part of Γ in the region {p2  ≥  |p1|} can be written as a graph

[formula]

for p1∈[ -  1,1], where φ is even, uniformly convex, tangent to p21 = p22 at ±  1, and separates from these lines like [formula]. We will give a more precise description of φ in Section [\ref=Constructions].

The other pieces of Γ can be written

[formula]

for pi∈[ -  1,1], representing the left, bottom and right pieces of Γ (see figure [\ref=Gammapic]).

Recall that [formula]. Then

[formula]

is the surface obtained by revolving Γ around the p1 axis. Let ΩR  ⊂  Ω be the surface obtained by revolving Γ1 around the p1 axis.

In the statement below, δ and γ are small positive constants depending on φ.

For any ε  >  0 there exists a smooth function G defined in a neighborhood of Ω such that

[formula]

and

If [formula] then SG(p,q)  ≥  γ|p - q|2 for all q∈Ω,

SG(p,q)  ≥    -  ε|p - q|2 otherwise for p,  q∈Ω.

We delay the proof of this proposition to Section [\ref=Constructions], and use it now to prove Theorem [\ref=main].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=main]

Recall that

[formula]

and let

[formula]

Then by Proposition [\ref=KeyProposition] we have [formula]. Let

[formula]

Since D2u1 has rank 2 away from the cone

[formula]

and similarly D2u2 has rank 2 away from

[formula]

it is easy to see that Σ is a smooth embedded surface in [formula].

Let

[formula]

Note that Ω1 is just ΩR squeezed by a factor of 1 / 2 in the p1 direction. Let νi be the outer normals to Ωi. Since ui are homogeneous degree one we have [formula] on [formula]. Furthermore, the preimage x∈S2 of any point in Σ satisfies either |x1|  ≤  |x3| or vice versa. It follows from these observations that if (p1,p2)∈Σ then either

[formula]

with β such that φ'(β) = 1 / 2, β  <  1 - δ (see figure [\ref=GradMap]). Assume p1 belongs to the set above.

Finally, let

[formula]

By rescaling Proposition [\ref=KeyProposition] we have for (p1,p2),  (q1,q2)∈Σ that

[formula]

Let ω0∈S2 be a preimage of p1 under [formula]. Then [formula] and [formula] for any ω∈S2, so

[formula]

giving quadratic separation. By Corollary [\ref=ExtensionCorollary] there is a smooth uniformly convex function F on [formula] so that F  =  F0 and [formula] on Σ, hence [formula] satisfies the Euler-Lagrange system [formula] in [formula]. Now it is straightforward to check that [formula] is a weak solution of the system in the whole B1. Indeed

[formula]

follows by integrating first by parts in [formula] and then letting ε  →  0.

Constructions

In this section we prove the key step, Proposition [\ref=KeyProposition]. Since [formula] is the surface obtained by revolving Γ around the p1 axis, we can reduce to a one-dimensional problem on Γ and then revolve the resulting picture around the p1 axis. Since all of our constructions will be on [formula] in this section we use coordinates (x,y) rather than (p1,p2).

Setup

Define H to be an even function in x and y which has the form

[formula]

and is defined in a neighborhood of every point on [formula], for some smooth functions f and h on

[formula]

Inequalities for φ

We now record some useful properties of Γ. For proofs see Section [\ref=Appendix]. The first estimate gives an expansion for φ near x  =   - 1.

The function φ is even, uniformly convex, and tangent to y = |x| at x  =    ±  1. Furthermore, φ'' is decreasing near x  =   - 1 and we have the expansion

[formula]

The second estimate says that the vertical reflection of φ over its tangent y  =   - x lies above and separates from Γ2 (see figure [\ref=SideSepPic]). It follows easily from the uniform convexity of φ.

The function a(x)  =   - 2x - φ is uniformly concave, tangent to Γ2 at x  =   - 1, and lies strictly above Γ2 for x  >   - 1.

Euler-Lagrange Equation

Let

[formula]

The condition that u0 solves the Euler-Lagrange equation [formula] is equivalent to

[formula]

Indeed, since G is linear near the surfaces obtained by revolving Γ2 and Γ4, we just need to verify the Euler-Lagrange equation where [formula] is on the surface ΩR obtained by revolving Γ1. By passing a derivative the Euler-Lagrange equation [formula] is equivalent to

[formula]

Let ΩR have outer normal ν and second fundamental form II. Since u0 is homogeneous degree one we have [formula] on S2. Let T be a frame tangent to S2 at x, and differentiate to obtain [formula] In coordinates tangent to ΩR at p  =  (p1,φ(p1),0) one computes

[formula]

and the Euler-Lagrange formula follows.

For a fast way to compute D2G in tangential coordinates, differentiate the equation G(p1,φ(p1),0)  =  f(p1):

[formula]

The other eigenvalue comes from the rotational symmetry of G around the p1 axis.

If we do the computation in [formula] we have n - 1 rotational principal curvatures and derivatives, giving the Euler-Lagrange equation [formula].

Convexity Conditions

Since most of our analysis is near a cusp, it is convenient to shift the picture by the vector (1, - 1) so that φ,  f are defined on

[formula]

L(x,y) = f(x) + f'(x)(x-x) + h(x) .

[formula]

S(p,q) = f(x) - L(x,φ(x)).

[formula]

s(x,x) = .

[formula]

lim s(x,x)= 12.

[formula]

. Using equation [\eqref=TangentPlane] we compute the formula for the intersection line:

[formula]

If condition [\eqref=FirstConvexityCondition] holds at x  =  0, it means that the origin lies below the intersection line, thus SH(p,q)  ≥  0 for all q∈Γ2 provided that the slope of the intersection line above is larger than - 1:

[formula]

For a nonnegative function [formula] define

[formula]

With this definition the slope condition above can be written as

[formula]

Near x  =  0 one computes [formula]. Thus, if f''(x)  =  Cx1 - α near x  =  0 then [\eqref=SecondConvexityCondition] holds. However, away from a small neighborhood of 0, condition [\eqref=SecondConvexityCondition] will not hold in our construction. We will use formula [\eqref=TangentPlane] more carefully, combined with Proposition [\ref=LeftSideSeparation], to deal with these cases.

Conditions [\eqref=FirstConvexityCondition] and [\eqref=SecondConvexityCondition] are independent of the linear part of f. Thus, when checking convexity conditions we only need to use the properties of f''.

Preliminary Construction

As a stepping stone to proving Proposition [\ref=KeyProposition] we construct first a C1,α function H0 near Γ, that is globally convex. We will use this construction to prove Theorem [\ref=ScalarExample] in Section [\ref=Appendix]. The function H∈C∞ is obtained by perturbing H0. Below we define

[formula]

Recall in the constructions below that we have shifted the picture by (1, - 1).

For any α∈(0,1) there exist a function H0 near Γ such that

H0 is a linear function depending only on x on Γ2, and similarly on Γ4.

H0 is pointwise C1,1 - α on the cusps of Γ and smooth otherwise,

[formula] away from the cone {x21  =  x22 + x23},

SH0(p,q)  ≥  0 for all p,  q∈Γ,

If p  =  (x,φ(x)) then SH0(p,q)  ≥  η(x)|p - q|2 for all q∈Γ, where η is some continuous function on

[formula]

We will define f0 by f0(0)  =  f0'(0)  =  0 and prescribe f0'', and then let H0 be the function determined by f0 through the Euler-Lagrange relation [\eqref=EulerLagrange]. It is easy to check that condition [\eqref=FirstConvexityCondition] holds if we take f0''  =  φ''. However, we want h0  =  f0'' / (2φ'') to go to zero at the endpoints so that H0 is linear on Γ2 and Γ4.

Motivated by the above and Remarks [\ref=LocalComputationFirstCondition] and [\ref=LocalComputationSecondCondition], define

[formula]

(See figure [\ref=f0pic]). Assume δ is tiny so that φ'' is well approximated by its expansion [\eqref=phiexpansion]. Let H0 be the function as in [\eqref=Hdef] determined by f0 through the Euler-Lagrange relation [\eqref=EulerLagrange].

The first three items are clear by construction so we check the convexity conditions. By symmetry we only need to consider [formula].

If p∈Γ2 the positive separation is a consequence of H0  ≥  0. This follows from the definition of H0 on [formula]. Also, by symmetry, the linear function on Γ4 intersects the linear function on Γ2 on the vertical line {x = 1}, and since Γ4  ⊂  {x > 1} we obtain H0  ≥  0 on Γ4 as well.

We now consider the situation when p∈Γ1 and distinguish two cases depending whether [formula] or [formula].

Let p  =  (x0,φ(x0)).

First Case: Assume first that q  =  (x,φ(x))∈Γ1. By symmetry of f0'' around x  =  1 we may assume x  <  x0.

If x0∈[0,δ] then by formula [\eqref=TS1] and Remark [\ref=LocalComputationFirstCondition] we have

[formula]

If x0∈[δ,2  -  δ] we have f0''  =  φ'', so one computes

[formula]

If x  ≥  δ then this is clearly controlled below by [formula], and if x  <  δ then we have

[formula]

which is controlled below by

[formula]

Finally, if x0  ≥  2 - δ then since f0'' / φ'' is decreasing on

[formula]

S(p,q) ≥ f"(t)(x-t) dt ≥ min{f"(x),min(φ")}(x-x).

[formula]

, we have using expansion [\eqref=phiexpansion] that

[formula]

If q∈Γ3 then quadratic separation holds as well since

[formula]

Second Case: By symmetry we may assume q∈Γ2. If x0  ≤  δ we compute

[formula]

By Remark [formula], inequality [\eqref=SecondConvexityCondition] holds strictly.

Now assume x0∈[δ,1]. Define

[formula]

Using the tangent plane formula [\eqref=TangentPlane] we compute

[formula]

by the computations in the first case. Furthermore, since f0''  ≤  φ'', the graph of g lies above the function

[formula]

defined in Proposition [\ref=LeftSideSeparation] (see figure [\ref=SideSepKeyPic]). Since a(x) lies strictly above Γ2 for x  >  0 and ∂yH0(x0,φ(x0))  =  1 / 2, we have strictly positive separation on Γ2.

Finally, for x0∈[1,2], the intersection of the tangent planes at p and at p̃  =  (2 - x0,φ(2 - x0)) is the line x  =  1 since f0'' is symmetric around x  =  1. By the previous computations, the tangent plane at p̃ is negative on Γ2. Thus, the tangent plane at p is negative on Γ2, completing the proof.

Proof of Key Proposition

We can slightly modify the construction of H0 from the previous section to make it smooth, at the expense of giving up a little convexity near the cusps of Γ. Below δ,  γ  >  0 are small constants depending only on φ. Let [formula].

For any ε  >  0 there exists a smooth function H defined on a neighborhood of Γ such that

H is linear (depending only on x) in a neighborhood of Γ2, respectively Γ4,

[formula],

[formula] for x∈[δ,2  -  δ], and Hy  ≥  0 on Γ1,

If p  =  (x,φ(x)) with x∈[δ,2  -  δ] then SH(p,q)  ≥  γ|p - q|2 for all q∈Γ,

SH(p,q)  ≥    -  ε|p - q|2 otherwise for p,  q∈Γ.

Note that the key Proposition [\ref=KeyProposition] follows easily from Proposition [\ref=HConstruction] by defining G as above.

Let [formula] in the construction of f0'' from the previous section and let ε  ≪  δ. Let f'' be a smoothing of f0'' defined by cutting it off smoothly to zero between ε and 2ε, gluing it smoothly to itself between δ and δ  +  ε, and making it symmetric over x  =  1 (see figure [\ref=fpic]). Let H be the function in [\eqref=Hdef] determined by f through the Euler-Lagrange relation [\eqref=EulerLagrange].

The first three conclusions are clear by construction so we just need to check the convexity conclusions. Most of them will follow by continuity.

If p∈Γ2 we have positive separation since H  ≥  0, so assume p  =  (x0,φ(x0)).

If x0∈[δ,2  -  δ] then the conclusion holds by continuity from the arguments in the proof of Proposition [\ref=H0Construction] after taking ε small.

Next we may assume by symmetry that x0∈[0,δ].

Case 1: Assume that x0  ≥  10ε.

If q  =  (x,φ(x)) with x  >  x0 then the positive separation follows again by continuity. If x  <  x0 one computes

[formula]

so condition [\eqref=FirstConvexityCondition] holds and we have positive separation on Γ1.

Since the cutoff is between ε and 2ε and f'' is increasing for x  <  δ we compute

[formula]

and by Remark [\ref=LocalComputationSecondCondition] the condition [\eqref=SecondConvexityCondition] holds for x0  <  δ. We thus have positive separation on Γ2 and Γ3.

Finally, for q∈Γ4 positive separation follows again by continuity.

This establishes positive separation everywhere for x0∈[10ε,2  -  10ε].

Case 2: Assume x0  ≤  10ε.

The tangent plane at p is of order ε on Γ, so we have positive separation when q∈Γ4.

Using that f'' is increasing and φ'' decreasing near 0, we obtain positive separation if q  =  (x,φ(x)) with x∈[x0,δ]. The same holds for x > δ by continuity.

If q  =  (x,φ(x)) for x  <  x0 we compute

[formula]

since sφ''(x0,x)  ≤  sφ''(x0,0)  ≤  1. This gives the desired estimate on Γ1.

Next we bound SH(p,q) with q∈Γ2. For this we estimate the location of the intersection line lp of the tangent plane at p with 0. By [\eqref=IntersectionLine], lp passes through

[formula]

We first claim that this point lies above the line y  =   - x. Indeed, since f'' is increasing in

[formula]

φ(x) + x ≥ (φ"(x) + O(1))x > φ"(x)x.

[formula]

y=l(x) = -x + φ'(x)(x-x).

[formula]

ξ + ξ = 1 + O().

[formula]

The proof shows in fact that SH(p,q) is only negative for p,  q very close to the same cusp.

Appendix

Convex Extension Lemma

Let [formula] be the tangential component and [formula] be the normal component, and let [formula] be the gradient of G on Σ. Note that condition [\ref=QuadSepCondition] implies [formula]. For x∈Σ let Tx,  Nx be the tangent and normal subspaces to Σ at x. Let dΣ(y) be the distance from y to Σ and let

[formula]

Finally, for [formula] let y(x) be the closest point in Σ to x. It is well-known that y and d2Σ are well-defined and smooth in a neighborhood of Σ, and for x∈Σ, Dxy(x) is the projection to Tx and D2(d2Σ / 2)(x) is the projection to Nx. (For proofs, see for example [\cite=AS]).

Step 1: We claim that the function

[formula]

with A large lifts quadratically from its tangent planes in Σσ for σ sufficiently small. We first compute for x∈Σ that

[formula]

giving that F  =  G on Σ and [formula] on Σ.

Now, for ε small and ν∈Nx we have y(x  +  εν)  =  x and dΣ(x + εν)  =  ε, so Fνν(x)  =  A. In addition, if x∈Σ and x  +  εz∈Σ for some unit vector z then by hypothesis we have

[formula]

Taking ε to zero we see that Fττ(x)  >  2γ for any tangential unit vector τ.

Take any unit vector e and write [formula] for some unit τ∈TxΣ and ν∈NxΣ. Since D2(d2Σ / 2) is the projection matrix onto Nx at x∈Σ, we have

[formula]

for some C independent of A. We conclude that [formula] on Σ for A sufficiently large, and in particular, [formula] on a neighborhood Σ2ρ of Σ.

Finally, we show that the tangent planes to F in Σσ separate quadratically for σ small. Let x,  z∈Σσ. We divide into two cases.

If |z - x|  <  ρ then x and z can be connected by a line segment contained in Σ2ρ, so it is clear that

[formula]

If on the other hand |z - x|  >  ρ, we use that

[formula]

Replacing y(z) by z and y(x) by x changes these quantities by at most Cσ, and since and |z - x|  >  ρ we have that

[formula]

for all x,  z∈Σσ for σ small.

Step 2: From now on denote the open set Σσ by N. Let Nε denote {x∈N:Bε(x)  ⊂  N}. Finally, let ρε denote the standard mollifier ε- nρ(x / ε) where ρ is supported in B1, nonnegative, smooth and has unit mass.

We define a global uniformly convex function that agrees with F on N. Let

[formula]

Then H0 is a uniformly convex function on [formula] with [formula] and furthermore by construction we have that H0  =  F on N.

To finish we glue H0 to a mollification. Fix δ so that Σ  ⊂  N2δ. Let

[formula]

for some ε small. In Nδ we have

[formula]

Finally, since [formula] we have [formula]

Let η be a smooth cutoff function which is 1 on N2δ and 0 outside of Nδ. Then let

[formula]

We compute

[formula]

Then H is smooth, H  =  F on N2δ and taking ε small we have D2H  >  γI, completing the construction.

Expansion of φ

The symmetries of φ follow from the symmetries of w.

The curve Γ1 is parametrized by [formula] for θ∈[π  /  4,  3π  /  4]. Let ν be the upward normal to Γ1. Since w is homogeneous degree one we have [formula]. Differentiating we get the the curvature [formula] where [formula] are the values of w on S1. Thus, φ is uniformly convex and its second derivatives blow up near x  =    ±  1. To quantify this we compute

[formula]

Expanding around [formula] (which gets mapped to the left cusp on Γ1) we get

[formula]

Differentiating implicitly one computes

[formula]

and that φ'' is decreasing near - 1.

Theorem [\ref=ScalarExample]

In [\cite=DS] the authors show that if u is a scalar minimizer to a convex functional [formula] on [formula] and F is uniformly convex in a neighborhood of [formula] then [formula] cannot jump arbitrarily fast across the strip. In particular, [formula] localizes to {p1  <  1} or {p1  >   - 1} for some γ small. In this final section we use the preliminary construction H0 from section [\ref=Constructions] to indicate why this result is not true in three or higher dimensions.

Make a global extension of H0 by taking

[formula]

The resulting extension is smooth near any non-cusp point of Γ. It is uniformly convex near each point on [formula] with the modulus of convexity decaying towards the cusps. Furthermore, 0 is flat in a neighborhood of every point on [formula]. Finally, if p is a cusp of Γ then it is straightforward to check that 0 is pointwise C1,1 - α at p, i.e. S0(p,x)  <  C|x - p|2 - α for all x near p. By iterating a mollification and gluing procedure similar to those used in the proof of lemma [\ref=ExtensionLemma] near the cusps we can get a global convex extension [formula] that is smooth away from the cusps, uniformly convex on [formula] away from the cusps, flat on convex sets containing Γ2 and Γ4, and C1,1 - α at the cusps.

In dimension n the Euler-Lagrange equation allows us to take f0''(x)  =  xn - 2 - α near the cusp, which gives [formula] an extra derivative for each dimension.

Let G0 be the function on [formula] obtained by revolving [formula] around the p1 axis (see figure [\ref=G0Pics]). By construction u0 solves the Euler-Lagrange equation [formula] away from the cone C0  =  {|x1|  =  r} where [formula]. Thus, it is not immediate that u0 minimizes [formula]. However, we claim u0 is a minimizer. To show this we must establish

[formula]

for any ψ∈C∞0(B1). The contribution from integrating in Bε and a thin cone {(1 - ε)r  <  |x1|  <  (1 + ε)r} is small. Integrating by parts in the remaining region with boundary S, we get a boundary term of the form [formula] where ν is the outer normal. The cones {|x1|  =  (1  ±  ε)r} are ε close, and the outward normals on these cones are ε close to flipping direction, so by the continuity of [formula] the contribution from this term is also small. Taking ε to zero we get the desired result.
