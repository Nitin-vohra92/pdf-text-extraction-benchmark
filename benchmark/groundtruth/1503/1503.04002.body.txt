Face-subgroups of permutation polytopes

The Conjecture

A permutation polytope P(G) is the convex hull, in [formula], of a subgroup G of the group Sn of n  ×  n permutation matrices. This is a convex geometric invariant of a permutation representation, and it yields various numerical invariants like dimension, volume, diameter, f-vector, etc. Permutation polytopes and their faces were studied in [\cite=BHNP07].

Let [formula] be a partition of the ground set. We define the stabilizer of this partition as

[formula]

[formula] is a face of P(G).

In [\cite=BHNP07] we formulated the following conjecture.

Let G  ≤  Sn. Suppose H  ≤  G is a subgroup such that [formula] is a face. Then there is a partition [formula] so that [formula].

As evidence for the conjecture, we observed that it holds for G  =  Sn as well as for cyclic G. Later, Jessica Nowack and Daniel Heinrich verified the conjecture for the dihedral groups Dn, compare [\cite=dihedralPermutationPolytopes].

Subsequent efforts to better understand the inequality description of permutation polytopes, even of abelian groups, can lead one to believe that there is hardly anything one could say about general permutation polytopes [\cite=cyclicPermutationPolytopesFPSAC].

The Proof

For i∈[n] we denote the orbit under G by G.i, and the stabilizer of i by Gi.

Let [formula] be the vertex-barycenter of [formula]. Then A has entries

[formula]

In particular, A only depends on the orbit structure of G.

The ij-entry of [formula] counts g∈G with g(j) = i. This number is either zero or equal to |Gi|. Now use |G| = |Gi|  ·  |G.i|.

Conjecture [\ref=conj] is true.

Let H  ≤  G be a subgroup such that [formula] is a face. Let [formula] be the partition of
