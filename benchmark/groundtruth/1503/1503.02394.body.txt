Keywords: Generalized trigonometric functions; Complete elliptic integrals; Arithmetic-geometric mean; Salamin-Brent's algorithm; p-Laplacian

Introduction

A generalization of the trigonometric sine function, denoted by sin px, is well-known. The function sin px, 1 < p <   ∞  , is defined as the inverse function of

[formula]

so that it is increasing in

[formula]

, where

[formula]

Clearly, sin 2x  =   sin x and π2  =  π. We can find a number of studies of sin px and πp in [\cite=DoR] [\cite=LE] [\cite=Li] and the references given there. For important applications to half-linear differential equations, or one-dimensional p-Laplace equations, we refer the reader to e.g. [\cite=DEM] [\cite=E] [\cite=N].

It is natural to try to relate the generalized trigonometric function to the complete elliptic integrals. Following [\cite=T3], we define the complete p-elliptic integrals of the first kind

[formula]

and of the second kind

[formula]

Moreover, we prepare auxiliary integrals

[formula]

where [formula] for x∈[0,πp  /  2]. Using Ip and Jp, we can write Kp(k) = Ip(1,k') and Ep(k) = Jp(1,k'), where [formula]. The complete p-elliptic integrals have similar properties to the complete elliptic integrals. We have complied some of them in the next section.

In the case p = 2, all the objects above coincide with the classical ones. As far as the complete elliptic integrals are concerned, the following fact is well-known (see [\cite=AAR] [\cite=BB3] for more details): Let a  ≥  b > 0, and assume that {an} and {bn} are sequences satisfying a0 = a, b0 = b and Both the sequences converge to the same limit as n  →    ∞  , denoted by M2(a,b), the Arithmetic-Geometric Mean of a and b. It is surprising that

[formula]

so that we can obtain the celebrated Gauss formula

[formula]

Combining [\eqref=eq:K_2] with [formula] and the Legendre relation (i.e. [\eqref=eq:p-legendre] with p = 2), Salamin [\cite=Sa] and Brent [\cite=Br] independently proved the following famous formula of π:

[formula]

We emphasize that [\eqref=eq:formula_pi] is known as a fundamental formula to Salamin-Brent's algorithm, or Gauss-Legendre's algorithm, for computing the value of π.

We are interested in finding a formula as [\eqref=eq:formula_pi] of πp for p  ≠  2. Recently, the author [\cite=T3] dealt with the case p = 3. We take sequences

[formula]

As in the case p = 2, both the sequences converge to the same limit M3(a,b) as n  →    ∞  . The important point is that

[formula]

and hence

[formula]

Then, by [\eqref=eq:K_3] with [formula] and [\eqref=eq:p-legendre] of Lemma [\ref=lem:p-legendre] with p = 3, we obtain

[formula]

In the present paper, we will give the following result of πp for p = 4.

Let a  ≥  b > 0, and assume that {an} and {bn} are sequences satisfying a0 = a, b0 = b and

[formula]

Then, both the sequences converge to the same limit M4(a,b) as n  →    ∞  , and π4 can be represented as

[formula]

where a0 = a = 1 and [formula].

To show Theorem [\ref=thm:main], it is crucial to prove

[formula]

which yields

[formula]

(cf. [\eqref=eq:K_2] and [\eqref=eq:K_3]).

(i) The complete p-elliptic integrals can be written as

[formula]

where F(a,b;c;x) denotes the Gaussian hypergeometric functions (for the proof, see [\cite=T3]). In fact, these are included in the generalized complete elliptic integrals of Borwein [\cite=BB3]. However, our argument needs neither knowledge of hypergeometric functions nor the elliptic function theory, by virtue of our forms [\eqref=eq:K_p(k)] and [\eqref=eq:E_p(k)] with generalized trigonometric functions.

(ii) It would be desirable to establish a formula of πp for any p  ≠  2,  3,  4 but we have not been able to do this. Our ultimate goal of this study is to generalize the strategy of Salamin and Brent, based on the Legendre relation and the Gauss formula, to the case p  ≠  2.

(iii) Since [formula], we have a new formula of π as follows:

[formula]

where {an}, {bn} are the sequences [\eqref=eq:sequence].

Formula of πp for p = 4

In this section, we will apply the complete p-elliptic integrals for p = 4 to compute π4, and prove Theorem [\ref=thm:main].

In [\cite=T3], we have proved the following Lemmas [\ref=lem:p-differential]-[\ref=lem:p-legendre] on Kp(k) and Ep(k) for any p∈(1,  ∞  ) and k∈(0,1). In the case p = 2, these are all basic facts for the complete elliptic integrals. For the proofs and other properties, we refer the reader to [\cite=T3].

As is traditional, we will use the notation [formula] and Ep'(k): = Ep(k').

[formula]

Kp(k) and Kp'(k) satisfy

[formula]

that is

[formula]

Moreover Ep(k) and Ep'(k) - Kp'(k) satisfy

[formula]

that is

[formula]

[formula]

In what follows, we consider only the case p = 4.

Let 0  ≤  k < 1 and [formula]. Then

[formula],

[formula],

[formula],

[formula].

First we will prove (ii), which is equivalent to

[formula]

We have known from Lemma [\ref=lem:p-hypergeometric] that K4(k') satisfies

[formula]

To show [\eqref=eq:RCT] we will verify that the function of right-hand side of [\eqref=eq:RCT] also satisfies [\eqref=eq:hRCT]. Now we let

[formula]

Applying Lemma [\ref=lem:p-differential] we have

[formula]

where [formula]. Thus, differentiating both sides of

[formula]

gives

[formula]

Here, by Lemma [\ref=lem:p-differential]

[formula]

Applying this and [\eqref=eq:dif] to [\eqref=eq:difdif], we see that the right-hand side of [\eqref=eq:difdif] is equal to 3k3f(k). This shows that f(k) also satisfies [\eqref=eq:hRCT] as K4(k') does.

The equation [\eqref=eq:hRCT] has a regular singular point at k = 1 and the roots of the associated indicial equation are both 0. Thus, it follows from the theory of ordinary differential equations that the functions K4(k') and f(k), which agree at k = 1, must be equal. This concludes the assertion of (ii).

Next we will show (i), (iv) and (iii) in this order.

(i) In (ii), setting

[formula]

we get [formula] and

[formula]

Then (ii) is equivalent to

[formula]

Replacing [formula] by k, we obtain (i).

(iv) Let [formula] be the number above, then

[formula]

It follows from (ii) that [formula]. Differentiating both sides in k, we have

[formula]

Applying

[formula]

and (ii), we see that the right-hand side is written as

[formula]

Thus we have

[formula]

Multiplying this by [formula], we obtain (iv).

(iii) It is obvious that (iv) can be written in [formula], that is,

[formula]

From (i) we have (iii). The proof is complete.

In fact, Proposition [\ref=prop:KE] (ii) is equivalent to the following identity by Ramanujan (see [\cite=Be]). The proof of (ii) above makes no use of identities of hypergeometric functions and gives a new and elementary proof of Ramanujan's identity.

We will write I4(a,b) and J4(a,b) simplicity I(a,b) and J(a,b) respectively when no confusion can arise.

The next lemma is decisive to show [\eqref=eq:K_4].

For a  ≥  b > 0,

[formula]

From Proposition [\ref=prop:KE] (ii) (with k replaced by k') we get

[formula]

This proves the lemma.

Let a  ≥  b > 0. Consider the sequences {an} and {bn} satisfying a0 = a,b0 = b and [\eqref=eq:sequence], i.e.

[formula]

It is easy to see that an  ≥  bn for any n, {an} is decreasing and {bn} is increasing. Hence each sequence converges to a limit as n  →    ∞  . Moreover, since

[formula]

these limits are same. We will denote by M4(a,b) the common limit for a and b.

Lemma [\ref=lem:I] implies that {a2nI(an,bn)} is a constant sequence:

[formula]

Letting n  →    ∞   in [\eqref=eq:constant] we have

For a  ≥  b > 0

[formula]

Therefore, [\eqref=eq:K_4] immediately follows from setting a = 1 and b = k'.

The sequence [\eqref=eq:sequence] and the identity [\eqref=eq:K_4] are similar to those in [\cite=BBG1]. However, our approach with Ip(a,b) helps to prove [\eqref=eq:K_4] in an elementary way without the elliptic function theory.

Let In: = I(an,bn), Jn: = J(an,bn), then

For a  ≥  b > 0

[formula]

Set [formula]. We see at once that

[formula]

Now, letting k = κn in Proposition [\ref=prop:KE] (iv), we have

[formula]

It is easily seen that κn' = bn / an and [formula]. Thus

[formula]

Multiplying this by an and using [formula] we obtain

[formula]

From [\eqref=eq:in] we accomplished the proof.

Let a  ≥  b > 0, then

[formula]

where [formula].

We denote I(a,b) and J(a,b) briefly by I and J respectively. Lemma [\ref=lem:I] gives a2nIn = a2I for any n. By Lemma [\ref=lem:IJ] and [formula], we obtain

[formula]

Multiplying this by 2n and summing both sizes from n = 0 to n = m - 1, we obtain

[formula]

On the other hand, since a2I = a2mIm, we have

[formula]

By [\eqref=eq:cubic] we get

[formula]

which means lim m  →    ∞2m(Jm - a2a2mI) = 0. Therefore, as m  →    ∞   in [\eqref=eq:J-aI] the proposition follows.

Now we are in a position to show Theorem [\ref=thm:main].

Let [formula] in Lemma [\ref=lem:p-legendre], then

[formula]

Letting a = 1 and [formula] in Proposition [\ref=prop:EK] we get

[formula]

where [formula]. Substituting this to [\eqref=eq:K], we have

[formula]

Finally, applying Proposition [\ref=prop:KM] with a = 1 and [formula] to this, we obtain

[formula]

This leads the result.
