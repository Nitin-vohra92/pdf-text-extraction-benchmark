Playing with positive feedback: external pressure-triggering of a star-forming disc galaxy

Introduction

The remarkable universality of the Schmidt-Kennicutt star formation law, ranging from global fits to star-forming galaxies in the nearby Universe [\citep=1998ApJ...498..541K], local fits to star-forming complexes within galaxies [\citep=Kennicutt+07], and to star-forming galaxies to z  ~  2, [\citep=Genzel+10] inspires considerable confidence in the theory of gravitational instability-driven star formation in galactic disks. There are exceptions, most notably in molecular complexes with anomalously low star formation rates [\citep=Rathborne+14], but simple and plausible additions to the usual density threshold criterion for star formation, most notably by incorporating turbulence, may go far towards resolving these issues, as demonstrated both theoretically (for a review see [\citealp=2011IAUS..270..179K]) and phenomenologically in well resolved examples such as NGC 253 [\citep=Leroy+15].

In the high redshift Universe, the accumulation of recent data on remarkably high star formation rates poses a fascinating challenge, [\citep=Drouart+14] [\citep=Piconcelli+15] [\citep=Rodighiero+15]. Is it simply a question of turning up the gas fraction or is a new mechanism at work for inducing more efficient star formation?

In this Letter, we reinforce the case for the latter, more radical view by simulating the evolution of a fully self-consistent, gas-rich star-forming disk galaxy that is subject to the overpressuring influence of a vigorous outburst from its central Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Star formation is a complex interplay between gas supply, multiphase interstellar medium (ISM), cloud collapse, and gas ejection from the disk. We will consider two cases, corresponding to gas-poor (gas fraction 10%) and gas-rich (gas fraction 50%) systems at z  ~  2.

The case for inducing star formation via AGN activity has been made analytically [\citep=] [\citep=Silk+Rees1998] [\citep=Silk+Norman2009] and in simulations [\citep=Gaibler+2012] [\citep=Ishibashi+Fabian2012] [\citep=Wagner+2012] [\citep=Zubovas+2013] with varying degrees of astrophysical reality. Simulations demonstrate that whether the AGN activity is jet or wind-induced is irrelevant: after a few kpc, both inputs are indistinguishable. Hitherto, however, star formation in the multiphase ISM has not been followed in adequate detail because of the lack of numerical resolution.

For the first time, we study the effects of pressurization of the disc by performing simulations in which we fully include self-gravity of the multiphase ISM and thereby trace the evolution of the star formation rate (SFR) as well as that of the gas content of the system.

Simulation Set-up

To study the efffect of an external pressure on a galaxy, we have performed a four isolated disc galaxy simulations with two different initial gas fractions of 10% (hereafter, gasLow) and 50% (hereafter, gasHigh). We allow the galaxies, of one-tenth the total mass of the Milky Way, to initially adiabatically relax to an equilibrium configuration (with a reasonable disc thickness) over the rotation time of the disc at its half-mass radius. After this first relaxation phase, we turn on the external pressure, gas cooling, star formation, and also feedback from supernovae (SNe), as will be described below.

In the initial conditions, the dark matter (DM) particles are sampled with an NFW [\citep=NFW97] density profile and a concentration parameter of c = 10 using the method introduced by [\citet=Springel+Hernquist2005]. For the DM particles, the virial velocity is set to be v200  =  70  km  s- 1, which corresponds to a virial radius of R200  ≈  96  kpc and a virial mass of [formula]. We use 106 DM particles with a mass resolution of [formula] to sample the DM halo. These stellar disk and bulge were initially sampled with [formula] particles of which [formula] were used to sample the bulge. The stellar particles are distributed in an exponential disc with a scale length of 3.44  kpc and scale height 0.2  kpc, and a spherical, non rotating bulge with a Hernquist ([\citeyear=Hernquist1990]) profile of scale radius 0.2  kpc.

The simulations are run with the ramses adaptive mesh refinement code [\citep=Teyssier2002]. The box size is 655  kpc with a coarse level of 7, and a maximum level of 14 corresponding to a maximum resolution of Δx = 40  pc. The refinement is triggered with a quasi-Lagrangian criterion: if the gas mass within a cell is larger than [formula] or if more than 8 dark matter particles are within the cell a new refinement level is triggered.

After relaxation, the origin of time was reset to zero and the base simulations were run further in time with an enhanced and uniform pressure outside the disc (pressure simulations) for another ≈  0.42  Gyr. This pressure enhancement is applied instantaneously at t = 0 for a value of 3P max (hereafter pa3) outside the sphere of radius r1  =  12  kpc. P max is the maximum radially averaged pressure in the disk at t = 0 (reached in the central few cells), with P max≃9.8  ×  10- 13  Pa for the gasLow simulation set and ≃4.7  ×  10- 12  Pa for the gasHigh simulation set.

Sub-grid models for cooling [\citet=Sutherland+Dopita1993] and star formation, as well as SN feedback, were used in the simulations. Gas is turned into star particles in dense cold regions of gas density ngas  >  n0  =  14  H  cm- 3 by drawing a probability from the Schmidt law [formula] to form a star with a stellar mass of [formula] [\citep=Rasera+Teyssier2006]. The gas pressure and density are evolved using the Euler equations, with an equation of state for a mono-atomic gas with γ = 5 / 3. In order to prevent catastrophic and artificial collapse of the self-gravitating gas, we use a polytropic equation of state T = T0(ngas / n0)κ - 1 to artificially enhance the gas temperature in high gas density regions (ngas > n0). Here κ = 2 is the polytropic index, and T0 = 270  K, chosen to resolve the Jeans length with minimum 4 cells [\citep=Dubois&Teyssier2008]. We account for the mass and energy release from type II SNe. The energy injection, which is purely thermal, corresponds to [formula], where [formula] is the mass fraction of stars going into SNe. We also return an amount ηSN  m* back into the gas for each SN explosion which occurs 10  Myr after the birth of the star particle. To avoid excessive cooling of the gas due to our inability to capture the different phases of the SN bubble expansion, we used the delayed cooling approach introduced by [\citet=Teyssier+2013].

Results

Disc fragmentation

The application of external pressure at t = 0 leads to fragmentation of the gaseous galaxy discs, i.e. accelerated clump formation. This can be seen in Fig. [\ref=fig:MapGasLow] for the gasLow  and in Fig. [\ref=fig:MapGasHigh] for the gasHigh simulations. However, the gasHigh case shows more gas between clumps in the enhanced pressure run, as well as more gas ejection from the disk.

Since the star formation recipe depends on the local gas density, we expect an enhanced star formation when more clumps are formed (gas gets more concentrated), assuming that the clumps have sufficient mass. Therefore, if external pressure leads to increased fragmentation and hence increased clump formation, we expect the star formation to be positively enhanced when external pressure is applied on the galaxy. We first consider the fragmentation by counting the high-density clumps. To find the clumps, we run the clump finder described in [\citet=Bleuler+Teyssier2014], which identifies all peaks and their highest saddle points above a given threshold (ngas  >  20  H  cm- 3). A clump is recognized as an individual one when the peak-to-saddle ratio is above 1.5, otherwise the peak is merged with the neighbor with which it shares the highest saddle point.

The top panel of Fig. [\ref=fig:CF-SFR] shows the number of clumps as a function of time. One can see that generally more clumps are formed when external pressure is applied. In the gasLow simulations, the number of clumps starts rising soon after this pressure is applied. In the absence of external pressure, the number of clumps is unity (the disc as a whole corresponds to a clump). This value is only reached at late times (after 300 Myr) once the gas has sufficiently collapsed to reach the clump gas density threshold.

On the other hand, in the gasHigh simulations, clump formation sets in at earlier times, even without any forcing by external pressure. This different behavior is related to differences in the [\cite=Toomre64] Q parameter in the galaxies of the two simulations, such that the gaseous disc is stable in the gasLow case (〈Q〉  =  3.29  >  1 measured at t = 0), but unstable in the gasHigh case (〈Q〉  =  0.72  <  1). This demonstrates that the fragmentation of the disc can be driven by the forcing of an external pressure, even though the disc is initially Toomre stable. For the gasHigh simulations, the rise in number of clumps is, however, much faster when external pressure is applied. At later times, the number of clumps flattens after ~   100 Myr where for the no pressure simulation the number of clumps keeps rising with time.

Mass Flow Rate

The star formation rate is sensitive to both the mass flux and to the clump mass distribution. We measure the gas mass flux through a sphere of radius 16 kpc as

[formula]

where i denotes the index of a cell within a shell of surface S and volume V. In all simulations with enhanced pressure, an incoming pressure-driven mass inflow is created at the beginning of the simulation and is followed by a short mass outflow (seen in the edge-on view of the galaxies in Figs. [\ref=fig:MapGasLow] and [\ref=fig:MapGasHigh]), after which it oscillates around zero for the remaining of the simulation (top panels of Fig. [\ref=fig:MassOutflow]). This is to be expected, as the pressure wave coming into the galaxy carries momentum causing the galaxy to expel more gas when compared with the non-pressurized case where the mass flow rate is close to zero.

The bottom panels of Fig. [\ref=fig:MassOutflow] shows that the cumulative mass flow remains negative for the gasLow pressurized simulations, indicating a greater mass inflow than outflow for these simulations, while the cumulative mass flow is close to zero for the non-pressurized simulations. Given that the SFR enhancement is larger (factor ~   10) than the net gas change (factor ~   2), we argue that the measured mass inflow does not have a major influence on SFR enhancement measured in the pressurized simulation of gasLow. For the gasHigh simulations, the difference in the cumulative mass flow is even smaller, showing that the two galaxies have the same amount of gas to form stars.

Star formation history

We have seen that an increased pressure enhancement leads to an increased number of clumps. Since the star formation is proportional to the local density and since the gas density threshold of clump detection was set to be above that for star formation, one expects a similar behavior for the SFR.

The SFR of the different runs, shown in the bottom panel of Fig. [\ref=fig:CF-SFR] for the gasLow (left) and gasHigh (right) simulations, resemble the time evolution of the number of clumps previously shown in the top panel of Fig. [\ref=fig:CF-SFR]. In particular, for the gasLow galaxies, while star formation sets in very late at a modest rate in the simulation without external pressure, the SFR rises almost immediately and gradually in the simulation when pressure is initially applied. For the gasHigh galaxies, the SFR rises gradually starting at early times when no pressure is enforced on the galaxy, and later accelerates, similarly to the clump behavior. In contrast, when external pressure is initially applied to the gasHigh galaxy, the SFR rises significantly faster at early times, reaching a plateau after ~  80 Myr, maintaining this rate for the remainder of the simulation.

Conclusions

We show that a toy model for AGN-induced overpressurization leads to enhanced star formation in disk galaxies. The effects are dramatic at early times, regardless of the initial gas fraction of the galaxy, although the high gas fraction galaxy, which is Toomre unstable, experiences a very early rapid burst of star formation, followed by more moderate SFR that remains above the SFR in the non-pressurized case. However, even in the Toomre stable low gas fraction galaxy, external pressure can enforce fragmentation and star formation, albeit on a longer time scale.

One reason for the increased star formation in pressurized galaxies is early pressure-driven mass inflow from the halo and outer disc, on a 10 Myr time-scale (Fig. [\ref=fig:MassOutflow]), especially on the low gas fraction galaxy. This gas inflow feeds cloud/clump growth in the inner parts of the galaxy (Fig. [\ref=fig:CF-SFR]) and eventually leads to enhanced star formation. The infall effects are more dramatic for the high gas fraction galaxy, where the disc is more unstable. (Fig. [\ref=fig:MapGasHigh]). We have confirmed this with a detailed analysis of the Toomre parameter and clump properties, which we defer to a more future study.

One expects that gas-rich star-forming galaxies should have gravitationally-driven star formation rates of the order of [formula], simply by scaling the gas surface density, and maintaining a similar efficiency. Indeed, observations at z  ~  2 confirm this trend. The more exotic cases of very high ([formula]) star formation rates are more typically found at higher redshift and almost invariably have associated luminous AGN. While any connection is speculative, and indeed the very direction of possible causality is vigorously debated, our simple tests of the effects of AGN-induced pressure, due to wind-driven or jet-initiated bow shocks that overpressurize the entire inner gaseous disk, suggest that strongly enhanced star formation rates are readily achievable.

Similar SFR enhancements are found from increased pressure in the initial stages of ram pressure harassment, although gas loss dominates the long term behavior [\citep=1999ApJ...516..619F] [\citep=1999MNRAS.308..947A] [\citep=2014MNRAS.438..444B]. Here, however, the gas is retained, and the star formation rate enhancement is far more pronounced.
