Problems around polynomials - the good, the bad and the ugly

Problems

I. Around Maxwell's conjecture. In Section 133 of [\cite=Maxwell], J. C. Maxwell formulated the following claim, but provided it will an incomplete proof (see details in [\cite=GNSh]).

For any system of N isolated fixed point charges in [formula], the number of points of equilibrium (assumed finite) of the created electrostatic field

[formula]

is at most (N - 1)2. Here ξi is a charge placed at [formula] and [formula] is a variable vector.

Some very crude estimate on the maximal number of points of equilibrium is obtained in [\cite=GNSh] using Khovanskii's fewnomial theory, see [\cite=Kh]. Conjecture [\ref=conj:Maxw] is not even settled for 3 positive point charges in which case all points of equilibrium lie in the plane spanned by these charges. (Some special cases of 3 charges are settled in the recent literature, see [\cite=Ki],[\cite=Pe],[\cite=Wa].)

Observe that for charges of different signs in [formula] the set of points of equilibrium might be a space curve. The simplest example of that kind is a 4-tuple of charges placed at the vertices of a square in the z-plane with coordinates (  ±  1,  ±  1,0). If one places the unit positive charges at (1,1,0) and ( - 1, - 1,0) and the unit negative charges at 2 remaining corners, then the set of points of equilibrium coincides with the z-axis. The following naive-looking question is not settled either.

For any set of charges of the same sign in [formula], the set of its points of equilibrium is finite.

The next claim is a very special one-dimensional case of a rather general Conjecture 1.7. of [\cite=GNSh] which generalizes the above Conjecture [\ref=conj:Maxw] in many ways.

Let [formula] be a collection of points in [formula], [formula] be arbitrary real charges and α  ≥  1 / 2. Then the rational univariate function

[formula]

has at most N local maxima on the whole real line.

Observe that also this conjecture is not settled in the simplest case N = 3, α = 1 and all unit charges. The author has an overwhelming numerical evidence supporting the latter conjecture but no proof.

II. On real zeros of exponential sums. Consider the space of linear ordinary homogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients of order k, i.e.

[formula]

where [formula] are arbitrary complex numbers. The next statement easily follows from the standard facts about the asymptotic zero distribution of exponential sums, see e.g., [\cite=La].

Every non-trivial solution of [\eqref=eq:triv] has finitely many (probably none) real zeros if and only if any two distinct characteristic roots of [\eqref=eq:triv] have distinct real parts.

Denote by Ωk the set of all [\eqref=eq:triv] satisfying the conditions of Lemma [\ref=lm:simple]. (It is an open dense subset of [formula] with coordinates [formula].)

Does there exist an upper bound for the number of real roots valid for all non-trivial solutions of all equations [\eqref=eq:triv] in Ωk?

The latter problem is open already for k = 3. Observe that there exists a highly non-trivial and apparently far from being sharp upper bound for the number of integer zeros of exponential polynomials obtained in [\cite=Sch].

III. On isolated zeros of non-negative polynomials and sums of squares.

Find the maximal possible number [formula] of isolated zeros for real non-negative polynomials of degree 2k in l variables.

Find the maximal possible number [formula] of isolated zeros for real non-negative polynomials of degree 2k in l variables which are representable as the sums of squares of real polynomials of degree at most k.

A trivial observation is that [formula] In the special case l = 2 both problems were considered in an intruguing paper [\cite=CLR] where it was proven that [formula] and [formula]. The latter inequality is obtained with the help of Petrovskii-Oleinik's inequality, see [\cite=OlPe].

For any number of variables, [formula].

On the other hand, it seems difficult to determine the coefficient of kl of the leading asymptotic term for [formula] when l is fixed and k  →    ∞  . For example, I doubt that [formula] grows asymptotically as 3k2  /  2, when k  →    ∞  .

IV. Hermite-Biehler problem. The well-known Hermite-Biehler theorem claims that a univariate monic polynomial s of degree k has all roots in the open upper half-plane if and only if s = p + iq. Here p and q are real polynomials of degree k and k - 1 respectively with all real, simple and interlacing roots, and q has a negative leading coefficient.

Given a pair of real polynomials (p,q), give restrictions on the location of the roots of p + iq in terms of the location of the roots of p and q.

An example of such results can be found in [\cite=KST]. Closely related important questions are: (i) restrictions on the location of (complex) roots of the Wronskian W(p,q); (ii) description of the real univalent disks for the real rational function [formula].

V. Mesh-related questions. By the mesh of a polynomial p(x) with all real simple zeros we mean the minimal distance between its consecutive roots.

A difference operator [formula] with constant coefficients preserves the set of real-rooted polynomials of degree at most m whose mesh is at least 1 if and only if the polynomial T((x)m) is real-rooted and has mesh at least one. Here [formula] is the m-th Pochhammer polynomial.

There is an alternative formulation of Conjecture [\ref=pr:finitedegreeDif] which is maybe more attractive. Let [formula] be the forward difference operator, and consider the following product on the space of polynomials of degree at most d:

[formula]

Conjecture [\ref=pr:finitedegreeDif] is equivalent to

If p and q are real-rooted polynomials of degree at most d and of mesh ≥  1, then so is [formula].

VI. Topology of the space of polynomials. The famous Descartes' rule of signs claims that the number of positive roots of a real univariate polynomial does not exceed the number of sign changes in its sequence of coefficients. For simplicity let us only consider polynomials with all non-vanishing coefficients. An arbitrary ordered sequence [formula] of ±  -signs is called a sign pattern. Given a sign pattern [formula] as above, we call by its Descartes' pair [formula] the pair of non-negative integers counting sign changes and sign preservations of [formula]. The Descartes' pair of [formula] gives the upper bounds on the number of positive and negative roots of any polynomial of degree d whose signs of coefficients are given by [formula]. (Observe that, for any [formula], [formula].) To any polynomial q(x) with the sign pattern [formula] we associate the pair (posq,negq) giving the numbers of its positive and negative roots (counted multiplicities). Obviously (posq,negq) satisfies the standard restrictions

[formula]

We call pairs (pos,neg) satisfying [\eqref=stand] for [formula]. It turns out that not for every pattern [formula] all its admissible pairs (pos,neg) are realizable by polynomials with the sign pattern [formula].

For a given sign pattern [formula] which admissible pairs (pos,neg) are realizable by polynomials whose signs of coefficients are given by [formula]?

The first non-realizable combination of a sign pattern and a pair (pos,neg) occurs in degree 4, see [\cite=Gr]. Namely, (up to the standard [formula]-action on the set of all sign patterns) the only non-realizable combination is [formula] with the pair (2,0). Based on our computer-aided results up to degree 10, we can formulate the following claim.

For an arbitrary sign pattern [formula], the only type of pairs (pos,neg) which can be non-realizable has either pos or neg vanishing. In other words, for any sign pattern [formula], each pair (pos,neg) satisfying [\eqref=stand] with positive pos and neg is realizable.

VII. Tropical geometry.

Let [formula] be a polynomial with positive coefficients, and consider the related (weighted) tropical polynomial

[formula]

Then the number of real zeros of f(z) does not exceed the number of points in the tropical variety defined by ftrop, i.e. the number of corners of the continuous piecewise-linear function [formula].

Let [formula] be a polynomial with positive coefficients. Consider the differences

[formula]

where a- 1  =  an + 1  =  0. Let [formula] be the sequence of indices such that ki is positive, and let v(f) be the number of changes in the sequence [formula]. Then the number of real zeros of f(z) does not exceed v(f).

] Let [formula] be a polynomial with positive coefficients. Consider the differences

[formula]

where a- 1  =  an + 1  =  0. Let [formula] be the sequence of indices such that cki is non-negative, and let v(f) be the number of changes in the sequence [formula]. Then the number of real zeros of f(z) does not exceed v(f).

Observe that for polynomials with all positive coeffficients, their real roots are negative.

VIII. Polynomial-like functions,.

Consider a smooth function f with n distinct real zeros [formula] in some interval [formula]. Then, by Rolle's theorem, f' has at least (n - 1) zeros, f'' has at least (n - 2) zeros, ... , f(n - 1) has at least one zero in the open interval (x(0)1,x(0)n). We are interested in smooth functions f with n real simple zeros in I such that for all [formula] the ith derivative f(i) has exactly n - i real simple zeros in I denoted by x(i)1 < x(i)2 < ... < x(i)n - i. Note, in particular, that f(n) is non-vanishing in I.

A smooth function f defined in an interval I is called polynomial-like of degree n if f(n) does not vanish in I. A polynomial-like function of degree n in I with n simple real zeros is called real-rooted.

By Rolle's theorem, n is the maximal possible number of real zeros in I for a polynomial-like function of degree n. An obvious example of a real-rooted polynomial-like function of degree n on [formula] is a usual real polynomial of degree n with all real and distinct zeros. Observe also that if a polynomial-like function f of degree n is real-rooted in I, then for all i < n, its derivatives f(i) are also real-rooted of degree n - i in the same interval. In the above notation the following system of inequalities holds:

[formula]

We call [\eqref=eq:1] the system of standard Rolle's restrictions. (It is worth mentioning that the standard Rolle's restrictions define the well-known Gelfand-Tsetlin polytope, see e.g., [\cite=deLoMcAl].)

With any real-rooted polynomial-like function f of degree n, one can associate its configuration Af of [formula] zeros {x(i)l} of f(i), for [formula] and 1  ≤  l  ≤  n - i, by taking first all x(0)l, then all x(1)l, etc.

What additional restrictions besides [\eqref=eq:1] exist on configurations Af  =  {x(i)l} coming from real-rooted polynomial-like functions of a given degree n? Or, more ambitiously, given a configuration [formula] of [formula] real numbers satisfying standard Rolle's restrictions, is it possible to determine if there exists a real-rooted polynomial-like f of degree n such that Af  =  A?

In the simplest non-trivial case n = 3, Problem [\ref=pr:ug] was solved in [\cite=ShShadd], but the general case is widely open.

Substituting each zero of p by the symbol 0, each zero of p' by 1, ... , the unique zero of p(n - 1) by (n - 1) respectively, we get a symbolic sequence of p of length [formula] with n occurrences of 0, (n - 1) occurrences of 1,..., one occurrence of (n - 1). Standard Rolle's restrictions result in the condition that between any two consecutive occurrences of the symbol i in such a sequence, one has exactly one occurrence of the symbol i + 1.

For example, there are only two possible symbolic sequences 012010 and 010210, for n = 3. For n = 4, there are 12 such sequences 0123012010, 0120312010, 0120132010, 0102312010, 0102132010, 0123010210, 0120310210, 0120130210, 0120103210, 0123010210, 0102130210, 0102103210. A patient reader will find that for n = 5, there are 286 such sequences.

If we denote by [formula] the number of all possible symbolic sequences of length n, then it is possible to calculate this number explicitly. It turns out to be equal to

[formula]

What symbolic sequences can occur for strictly real-rooted polynomials of degree n?

IX. Around "Hawaiian" conjecture. A simple observation that if a real polynomial p(x) has all real and simple zeros then the function [formula] is (locally) strictly monotone was apparently known to Gauss. We can reformulate the above observation in the form of the classical Laguerre inequality:

If p(x) has only simple real zeros then the polynomial P1(x) = (p'(x))2 - p(x)p''(x) is strictly positive.

Refinement of this observation constitutes the "Hawaiian" conjecture saying that for any real polynomial p(x) with simple real zeros (and arbitrary complex-conjugate pairs of zeros),

[formula]

Here [formula] (resp. [formula]) stands for the number of real (resp. non-real) zeros of a polynomial q(x) with real coefficients.

"Hawaiian" conjecture was settled in [\cite=Tya] by elementary but tedious calculations. Observe that polynomial P1(x) = (p'(x))2 - p(x)p''(x) appears not only as the numerator of [formula] but also in a different situation discovered by J. Jensen, [\cite=Je] around 1910. Namely, consider the function

[formula]

Φp(x,y) is a real-analytic nonnegative function in (x,y) whose zeros correspond to the zeros of p(z) = p(x + iy). Assuming that deg p(x) = k and expanding Φp(x,y) in the variable y, one gets

[formula]

where

[formula]

{In particular, P0(x) = p2(x) and P1(x) = (p'(x))2 - p(x)p''(x).) The following explicit formula

[formula]

is valid. Here [formula] and the summation is taken over all 2i-tuples (with repetitions in case of multiple zeros). The latter formula immediately implies the following criterion of real-rootedness known to J. Jensen.

A polynomial p(x) of degree k has simple real zeros if and only if the polynomials Pi(x) are strictly positive for all [formula].

Somewhat later G. Polya studying a number of unpublished notes left after Jensen's untimely death in 1912 discovered a different criterion of real-rootedness,

A polynomial p(x) of degree k has real simpe zeros if and only if the polynomials

[formula]

are strictly positive for all [formula].

Propositions [\ref=cr1]-[\ref=cr2] combined with the original "Hawaiian" conjecture motivate our questions of the number of real zeros for the families {Pi(x)} and {Gi(x)} presented below. They are based on extensive experiments with real polynomials of degree up to 6.

For any real polynomial p(x) of degree k with simple real zeros,

[formula]

i.e. "Hawaiian" conjecture holds for G1(x) as well.

For any real polynomial p(x) of degree k with simple real zeros,

[formula]

Additionally, we claim

For any real polynomial p(x) of even degree,

[formula]

The latter inequality is trivially satisfied for odd degree polynomials.

For any degree k polynomial p(x) with real coefficients,

[formula]
