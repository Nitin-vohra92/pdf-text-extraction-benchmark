Volume and Hilbert function of [formula]-divisors

Introduction

Let X be a proper, normal algebraic variety of dimension n over a field K and D an [formula]-divisor on X. The Hilbert function of D is the function

[formula]

defined for all [formula]. If D is an ample Cartier divisor then H(X,D) agrees with the usual Hilbert polynomial whenever m  ≫  1 is an integer, but in general H(X,D) is not a polynomial, not even if D is a [formula]-divisor and [formula]. The simplest numerical invariant associated to the Hilbert function is the volume of D, defined as

[formula]

If E is an effective [formula]-divisor, then

[formula]

holds for every m > 0, hence

[formula]

Furthermore, if equality holds in ( * ) for every m  ≫  1 then equality holds in ( *  * ). The aim of this note is to prove the converse for big divisors, that is, when [formula]. Although the volume does not determine the Hilbert function, we prove that

[formula]

As a byproduct of the proof we also obtain a characterization of such divisors E in terms of the negative part Nσ(D) of the Zariski-Nakayama-decomposition (also called σ-decomposition) and of the divisorial part of the augmented base locus [formula]; see [\cite=nakayama04], [\eqref=defnegativepart] and [\eqref=aug.bs.defn] for definitions.

Another interesting consequence is that the answer depends only on the [formula]-linear equivalence class of D. This is obvious for [formula]-linear equivalence, but it can easily happen that [formula] yet h0(X,mD)  ≠  h0(X,mD') for every m > 0; see ([\ref=Hf.lineq.exmp]). In fact, the only relationship between H(X,D) and H(X,D') that we know of is [formula].

Our main results are the following.

Special cases of these theorems were first conjectured in connection with the numerical stability criteria for familes of canonical models of varieties of general type [\cite=k-modbook]. In trying to prove these, we gradually realized that the above results hold and the general setting led to shorter proofs.

The theorems are proved in Section [\ref=mainresultsec] but the necessary technical background results involving [formula]-divisors, the Zariski-Nakayama-decomposition and of the augmented base locus on singular varieties are left to Sections [\ref=weildivsec] through [\ref=s:bdp]. Much of the relevant literature works with smooth projective varieties over [formula] but many of these proofs apply in more general settings. We went through them and we state clearly which parts work for normal varieties in any characteristic. We also establish several results that show how to reduce similar types of questions to smooth and projective varieties. These should be useful in similar contexts.

Proofs of the Theorems

Let X be a normal proper variety over an algebraically closed field and D a big [formula]-divisor. Suppose that D = P + N with [formula] and N effective. Then N  ≤  Nσ(D).

The proof is a modification of [\cite=fl13z].

By Corollary [\ref=cor:makingcartier], we may find a projective birational model X' and [formula]-Cartier [formula]-divisors D' and P' on X' such that for any positive real m the pushforward of OX'(mD') and OX'(mP') are respectively OX(mD) and OX(mP), and the difference D' - P' is effective. Note that D' and P' still satisfy the hypotheses of the theorem. If we prove the statement on X', we can conclude the statement on X by pushing forward and applying Lemma [\ref=lem:stricttransformgamma]. So without loss of generality we may assume that P and D, and hence N, are [formula]-Cartier [formula]-divisors and that X is projective.

If π:Y  →  X is a generically finite proper morphism from a normal projective variety Y, then

[formula]

by Lemma [\ref=lem:nspush].ii). Furthermore

[formula]

by Theorem [\ref=volprop].ii), the homogeneity of [formula], and [\cite=kur06] (the proof there does not use the assumption that the characteristic is zero). Therefore after passing to a nonsingular alteration (cf. [\cite=dejong96]), it is enough to consider the case when X is nonsingular and projective.

By assumption the volume of P does not change if we add a small multiple of N. Thus by [\cite=cutkosky13] (see also [\cite=bfj09] and [\cite=lm09]),

[formula]

where 〈Pn - 1〉 is the positive intersection product defined in [\cite=cutkosky13], inspired by [\cite=bfj09] and classical work of Matsusaka ([\cite=Matsusaka72]; see also [\cite=matsusaka75])

As in the proof of [\cite=bfj09], it follows that for any ample [formula]-Cartier [formula]-divisor A on X and any small ε  >  0, we have

[formula]

(Otherwise from [formula] we get [formula] for any component Ni of N, i.e. [formula] is numerically equivalent to an effective [formula]-divisor that does not contain Ni in its support. Using [\cite=bfj09], we see that [formula], but the LHS is only zero when N = 0.)

In particular, Lemma [\ref=lem:negsections2] shows that Nσ(P  -  εA  +  N)  =  Nσ(P  -  εA)  +  N. Letting ε tend to 0 and using continuity of σ as in Lemma [\ref=lem:sigmaproperties].iv), we see that Nσ(D)  =  Nσ(P)  +  N.

We reduce our main theorems to the case where the base field is algebraically closed.

Proof of Theorem A

By Remark [\ref=rmk:closedperfect] we may work over an algebraically closed field. The implications ii)  →  iii)  →  iv)  →  i) are immediate, while i)  →  ii) is Proposition [\ref=prop:Zunique2]. Any nef [formula]-Cartier [formula]-divisor D is movable, i.e. Nσ(D) = 0. Then the equivalence between ii) and v) is clear.

Proof of Theorem B

As in Theorem A, we may work over an algebraically closed field. The implications iii)  →  iv)  →  i) are immediate. Part ii) of Theorem A and Lemma [\ref=lem:negsections2] prove i)  →  iii).

Assume [formula]. Let A be ample in codimension 1 (cf. Definition [\ref=def:amplecod1]). By Lemma [\ref=lem:bdpzariski] and Lemma [\ref=lem:bdpalternate], we have Supp(E)  ⊆  Supp(Nσ(D - εA)) for arbitrarily small ε > 0. By Lemma [\ref=lem:negsections2], we see that [formula] for sufficiently small ε  >  0. If D, E and A are [formula]-Cartier, we can conclude [formula] by the continuity of volumes for [formula]-Cartier [formula]-divisors. To show that [formula] in general, we reduce to the [formula]-Cartier case by applying Theorem [\ref=volprop].ii) and Corollary [\ref=cor:makingcartier]. Hence ii)  →  i).

Let F be an irreducible component of E and assume [formula]. Then by Lemma [\ref=concretesigma] there exists m > 0 such that

[formula]

is [formula]-linearly equivalent to an effective divisor that does not contain F in its support. In particular h0(mD' + rE)  ≥  h0(mD' + F) > h0(mD') for some [formula] and some r > 0, e.g. [formula]. Therefore iii)  →  ii).

Suppose now that D is a big and nef [formula]-Cartier [formula]-divisor. Let π:Y  →  X be a proper birational morphism with Y projective. By Lemma [\ref=lem:wlift] there exists an effective π-exceptional divisor F on Y such that [formula], where [formula] is a divisor with [formula]. We can make choices such that [formula] and F are [formula]-Cartier [formula]-divisors. Of course [formula].

If [formula], then [formula]. By [\cite=cutkosky13], we get [formula]. Since D is nef, we have (π*D)n - 1  =  〈(π*D)n - 1〉 from [\cite=cutkosky13]. By the projection formula Dn - 1  ·  E = 0.

Conversely, if [formula], then [\cite=luo90] shows that [formula] (the analogous equality also holds for multiples). The proof there is carried out with [formula]-coefficients and over base fields of characteristic zero, but extends to [formula]-coefficients over arbitrary algebraically closed base fields. We conclude by pushing forward to X.

As mentioned in the introduction, if [formula], there is no clear connection between the Hilbert functions H(X,D) and H(X,D') other than that [formula] (cf. Theorem [\ref=volprop].iv)):

Weil divisors

Let X be a normal variety over a field. The basics of the theory of Weil [formula]-divisors can be found in [\cite=schwede]. An [formula]-divisor (also called Weil [formula]-divisor or [formula]-Weil [formula]-divisor) is an [formula]-linear combination of prime divisors. D is effective, denoted D  ≥  0, if it is a nonnegative combination of prime divisors on X. If D  ≥  E, i.e. D - E  ≥  0, we say that D dominates E. For an [formula]-divisor D, the rule

[formula]

defines a coherent sheaf OX(D) on X. This coincides with the classical notation when D is a [formula]-divisor. Note that OX(D) = OX(⌊D⌋). If D  ≥  0, then OX( - D) is an ideal sheaf in OX. If M is a Cartier [formula]-divisor, then [formula] for any [formula]-divisor D.

If D and D' are [formula]-divisors such that D' - D = div(f) for some f∈K(X), we say that D and D' are linearly equivalent and denote this relation by D  ~  D' or [formula]. Denote by |D| the complete linear series [formula]. It coincides with |⌊D⌋| + {D}, where {D} denotes the fractional part of D. If mD  ~  mD' for some [formula], we write [formula]. If [formula] for some [formula], some [formula] and fi∈K(X), we write [formula]. Denote by [formula] and [formula] the set of effective [formula]-divisors D' that are [formula]-linearly and respectively [formula]-linearly equivalent to D. If D  ~  D', then H0(X,D)≃H0(X,D') and if [formula], then H0(X,mD)≃H0(X,mD') for sufficiently divisible m. However, no obvious connection seems to exists between H0(X,D) and H0(X,D') if [formula].

An [formula]-divisor H is ample if [formula], where [formula], where fi∈K(X), and Hi are effective ample Cartier [formula]-divisors. Note that an ample [formula]-divisor is always [formula]-Cartier, and that this definition coincides with the classical one in [\cite=lazarsfeld04].

Two [formula]-Cartier [formula]-divisors are numerically equivalent if they have the same intersection against every proper curve in X.

We review some of the basic theory of [formula]-divisors. Over [formula], many of the results in this section appear in [\cite=nakayama04] or [\cite=fujino09].

Let X be a normal variety and D an effective [formula]-Cartier [formula]-divisor. Then D is a positive [formula]-linear combination [formula] of effective Cartier divisors.

The argument in [\cite=fujino09] is characteristic free.

Let π:Y  →  X be a proper birational morphism of normal varieties, and D an [formula]-Cartier [formula]-divisor on X. Then π*OY(π*D + E) = OX(D) for any effective π-exceptional [formula]-divisor E.

The argument is similar to [\cite=nakayama04]. Let U  ⊂  X be open and f∈K(X)*. By the projection formula [\cite=fulton84], if divY(f) + π*D + E  ≥  0 over π- 1U, then divX(f) + D  ≥  0 over U. By Lemma [\ref=lem:effCartier], we see that if divX(f) + D  ≥  0 on U, then divY(f) + π*D  ≥  0 on π- 1U. In particular divY(f) + π*D + E  ≥  0 on π- 1U.

The following lemma can be used to reduce many questions involving the shaves OX(D) to normal projective varieties.

Let π:Y  →  X be a proper birational morphism of normal varieties and Di a finite collection of [formula]-divisors on X. Then there are [formula]-divisors DYi on Y such that π*DYi = Di for every i and

[formula]

for every [formula], effective π-exceptional [formula]-divisor F on Y, and [formula]-Cartier [formula]-divisor M on X.

If the statement is true for F = 0, then it is true for every F  ≥  0, so we assume that F = 0 throughout. The question is local on X, so we may also assume that X is affine. Let E be the reduced Weil divisor whose support is the divisorial component of the exceptional locus of π. For D an [formula]-divisor on X, and [formula] an [formula]-divisor on Y with [formula], we have [formula]. Then by coherence there exists rD such that

[formula]

Let φ be a regular function on X such that L: = divX(φ)  ≥  Di for all i. Let [formula] be [formula]-divisors on Y such that [formula]. For any r  ≥  0, we have [formula] for some effective π-exceptional [formula]-divisor Ei'. By Lemma [\ref=lem:pushpullCartier], any global section of [formula] for any r  ≥  0 is also a global section of [formula]. Thus the poles along E of rational functions that are sections of [formula] are bounded below by [formula]. This implies that there exists r > 0 such that [formula] is independent of t  ≥  0 for each mi  ≥  0. In particular it is equal to [formula] by [\eqref=eq:h0stop]. Since X is affine, this implies [formula]. Set DYi: = Di + rE.

We now show that if M is an [formula]-Cartier [formula]-divisor on X, then [formula] if and only if [formula]. Up to replacing M by M + divX(f), this completes the proof. One implication is clear by the projection formula. Assume now [formula]. If M is a [formula]-Cartier [formula]-divisor, then uM is a Cartier divisor for some positive integer u, and by the projection formula,

[formula]

for all [formula]. Thus if 1 is a section of [formula], then it is also a section of [formula].

Assume now [formula] is an [formula]-combination of Cartier divisors, with [formula]. We may further assume that Di or - Di is a prime divisor for each i. As a condition on the mi's and aj's, the effectivity of [formula] is a system of linear inequalities with integer coefficients. Any of its real solutions can be approximated arbitrarily close by rational solutions. We conclude from the case when M is a [formula]-Cartier [formula]-divisor by taking limits coefficientwise.

The following corollary allows us to reduce questions about [formula]-divisors to [formula]-Cartier [formula]-divisors.

Let Di be a finite set of [formula]-divisors on a normal variety X. Then there exist a quasiprojective, normal variety Y, a proper birational morphism π:Y  →  X and [formula]-Cartier [formula]-divisors DYi on Y such that π*DYi = Di and

[formula]

holds for all [formula], all effective π-exceptional [formula]-divisors G on Y and all [formula]-Cartier [formula]-divisors M on X.

We may assume that Di or - Di is a prime divisor for each i. Successively normalize the blow-up of the birational transform of each Di, obtaining a birational morphism f:Z  →  X with [formula]-Cartier [formula]-divisors D'i such that f*D'i = Di. Let g:Y  →  Z be the normalized blow-up of the exceptional locus of f. Let [formula]. Then [formula] is an [formula]-Cartier [formula]-divisor with [formula]. The relative O( - 1) for g is an effective Cartier divisor F whose support is the exceptional locus of π. As in the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:wlift], for [formula], we may set [formula]. To obtain Y quasiprojective, apply Chow's Lemma and normalize.

We have defined [formula]. For [formula]-Cartier [formula]-classes on projective varieties, this definition of volume differs from the classical one (cf. [\cite=lazarsfeld04]). The definitions coincide for [formula]-classes but in [\cite=lazarsfeld04] the volume of [formula]-classes is defined by homogeneous extension from [formula] and for [formula]-classes it is given by continuous extension from [formula]. We check that the definitions in fact agree. We also check that we can replace lim sup  by lim .

Most of the references used in the proof work over [formula]. [\cite=cutkosky13] and the references therein explain how to extend these to arbitrary fields.

By Corollary [\ref=cor:makingcartier], we may assume that X is projective and D (hence also D') and B are [formula]-Cartier [formula]-divisors. Then there exists an ample [formula]-divisor H with D  ≤  H. Hence H0(X,mD) is a graded linear series. If D is not big, then the limit is zero. Otherwise by [\cite=cutkosky13b] we have

[formula]

where [formula]. We will return to showing that m0 = 1.

For now we prove ii) and iii). Provisionally denote by [formula] the volume of the [formula]-Cartier [formula]-divisor D in the sense of [\cite=lazarsfeld04]. From [\eqref=eq:vollim] we see that [formula] is also homogeneous, so that for a [formula]-Cartier [formula]-divisor D we have [formula].

We first show that if [formula], then [formula]. By homogeneity we may assume h0(D) > 0. Then D = E + div(f) for some effective [formula]-Cartier [formula]-divisor E and for some rational function f on X. By Lemma [\ref=lem:effCartier], we have [formula] for some positive [formula] and effective Cartier [formula]-divisors Ei. Then

[formula]

The LHS and RHS both converge to [formula] as m grows. Furthermore if [formula], then [formula] is a big Cartier [formula]-divisor for large enough m, hence it dominates some ample [formula]-divisor by Kodaira's Lemma (cf. [\cite=lazarsfeld04]).

It remains to show that if [formula], then [formula]. First observe that if [formula], then D is big in the sense of [\cite=lazarsfeld04], i.e. D dominates an ample [formula]-divisor. Indeed by continuity (cf. [\cite=lazarsfeld04]) there exists a small ample [formula]-divisor H such that D - H is a [formula]-Cartier [formula]-divisor with [formula]. Then the claim follows from Kodaira's Lemma. We can write

[formula]

where Hi are ample effective [formula]-divisors, fi are rational functions, Ej are effective [formula]-Cartier [formula]-divisors, ai and bj are positive real numbers. Let F be the union of the supports of div(fi). There exists a real number N > 0 such that {mai}div(fi) >  - N  ·  F for all i and all m. Furthermore there exists a positive integer r such that for each i the Weil divisor rHi - N  ·  F has a section given by some rational function gi. In particular

[formula]

Then

[formula]

The RHS is an effective big Cartier [formula]-divisor for m sufficiently large, therefore [formula]. The proof of ii) is complete. Part iii) follows easily from the projective and [formula]-Cartier case. We have showed that if D is an [formula]-Cartier [formula]-divisor, and [formula], then mD is effective for m large enough. This proves that m0 = 1, and completes the proof of i). The volume function [formula] is defined on the real Néron-Severi space [formula], and then part iv) follows.

Divisorial Zariski decompositions

Let X be a normal proper variety over a field K. Let D be a big [formula]-divisor. Following Nakayama ([\cite=nakayama04]), for Γ a prime divisor on X we define

[formula]

where we write [formula] if there exist rational functions fi on X and real numbers ai such that [formula]. The basic properties of σΓ(D) are studied by [\cite=nakayama04] for smooth projective varieties in characteristic 0, and by [\cite=Mus11], [\cite=chms13] for smooth projective varieties in arbitrary characteristic. We make the brief verifications necessary to extend these results to normal proper varieties as well. We start with the projective case.

Let X be a normal projective variety and D a big [formula]-divisor. Fix a prime divisor Γ.

We also have [formula] and

[formula]

Let A be an ample [formula]-Cartier [formula]-divisor. Then [formula].

The [formula]-divisor F: = D  -  σΓ(D)Γ has σΓ(F)  =  0 and σΓ'(F)  =  σΓ'(D) for any other prime divisor Γ'. Furthermore the natural inclusion [formula] is an equality for any positive real number m.

If L is a numerically trivial [formula]-Cartier [formula]-divisor then σΓ(D  +  L)  =  σΓ(D). The induced function [formula] sending a numerical class α∈N1(X) to σΓ(D  +  α) is continuous in a sufficiently small neighborhood of 0.

The proofs are analogous to [\cite=nakayama04] and [\cite=nakayama04].

We can usually reduce questions involving σΓ to the projective case by using Lemma [\ref=lem:wlift] and the following:

Let π:Y  →  X be a birational morphism of normal, proper varieties. Suppose that D is a big [formula]-divisor on X. Assume that one of the following holds:

There exists a big [formula]-divisor L on Y with π*L = D such that for every [formula]-Cartier [formula]-divisor M on X the condition D + M  ≥  0 holds iff L + π*M  ≥  0.

X and Y are projective and there exists a big [formula]-divisor L on Y such that π*OY(mL) = OX(mD) for all integers m  ≥  0.

Then for any prime divisor Γ on X we have σΓ(D)  =  σΓ'(L) where Γ' is the birational transform of Γ on Y.

By letting M range through the [formula]-linearly trivial divisors on X we immediately obtain i). Part ii) is a consequence of Lemma [\ref=lem:sigmaproperties].i) and the fact that π* induces an equality of global sections for sheaves.

We can now define

[formula]

We call the decomposition D = Pσ(D) + Nσ(D) the divisorial Zariski decomposition of D.

We say that a big [formula]-divisor D is movable if Nσ(D) = 0 or equivalently D = Pσ(D).

Let X be a normal variety. An [formula]-divisor A is ample in codimension 1 if there exists a closed subset Z  ⊂  X of codimension at least 2 such that [formula] is an ample [formula]-Cartier [formula]-divisor.

The following lemma shows that all normal varieties admit such divisors.

Let π:Y  →  X be a proper, generically finite, dominant morphism of normal varieties, and A an [formula]-divisor on Y that is ample in codimension 1. Then π*A is ample in codimension 1.

By removing a suitable subset of codimension 2 from X we may assume that π is finite and A is ample on Y. Note π*A is [formula]-Cartier in codimension 1, so that by shrinking Y and X further we may assume π*A is also [formula]-Cartier. If B is a [formula]-divisor whose multiples separate finite subsets on Y, then multiples of π*B also separate finite subsets on Y. Thus π*A is ample.

Let X be a normal proper variety over a field, Γ a prime divisor, and A an [formula]-divisor that is ample in codimension 1. Then

If E is an [formula]-divisor, then, for m sufficiently large, [formula], for some Bm  ≥  0 with [formula].

If P is a big [formula]-divisor with σΓ(P) = 0, then [formula], for some C  ≥  0 with [formula].

For i), by working over the smooth locus of X we see that E + mA is ample in codimension 1 for m sufficiently large and then the statement is clear.

Let m be as in part i) for E = Γ. By the definition of σΓ, there exists an effective [formula] such that [formula]. By i), we have that Pm + A is [formula]-linearly equivalent to an effective [formula]-divisor C without Γ in its support.

Let X be a normal proper variety. Then

If D is a big [formula]-divisor, then Pσ(D) is big and movable. If D is effective, then so is Pσ(D).

If P and D are big [formula]-divisors with P movable and P  ≤  D, then P  ≤  Pσ(D).

If π:Y  →  X is a proper generically finite dominant morphism of normal proper varieties and P is a big movable [formula]-divisor on Y, then π*P is also big and movable.

Let A be an [formula]-Cartier [formula]-divisor that is ample in codimension 1. Then for every [formula]-divisor E there exists εE > 0 such that A - εEE is big and movable.

Part i) is a consequence of Lemma [\ref=lem:sigmaproperties].iii) in the projective case, and can be reduced to this case in general by Lemma [\ref=lem:stricttransformgamma].i) and Lemma [\ref=lem:wlift].

For part ii), assume D = P + N with N effective. By Lemma [\ref=lem:stricttransformgamma].i), and Lemma [\ref=lem:wlift] we can assume that X is projective. Let A be an effective ample divisor. For all prime divisors Γ on X we have

[formula]

By summing over all Γ's we obtain Nσ(D + εA)  ≤  Nσ(N + εA), and hence Pσ(D + εA)  ≥  P. The continuity property in Lemma [\ref=lem:sigmaproperties].ii) implies Pσ(D)  ≥  P.

In iii), observe first that any divisor ample in codimension 1 is big. Furthermore, an [formula]-divisor is big if and only if it dominates some divisor ample in codimension 1. From Lemma [\ref=lem:pushacd1] it follows that if P is big, then π*P is also big.

To settle the movability of π*P, by Lemmas [\ref=lem:sigmaproperties].i), [\ref=lem:stricttransformgamma].i) and Remark [\ref=movlim], it is enough to show that if V is a linear series without fixed divisorial components on Y, then π*V spans a linear series without fixed divisorial components on X. By Remark [\ref=rmk:closedperfect] we may assume that the base field is infinite. If Γ is a prime divisor on X, let Γ'i with 1  ≤  i  ≤  r be the divisorial components of π- 1Γ. If π*V spans a linear series with a fixed component Γ, then [formula] for all Q∈π*V and for some ε > 0 by the finite dimensionality of V. Then V is the union of the proper subspaces [formula]. This is impossible over an infinite field.

Since global sections are determined outside any codimension 2 subset, it is enough to consider the projective case of iv). By the lower convexity of Nσ, it is enough to treat the case when A and E are [formula]-divisors with A ample Cartier. Then [formula] is globally generated for large m. In particular the linear series |mA - E| has no fixed components and [formula].

Let π:Y  →  X be a generically finite morphism of normal proper varieties and D a big [formula]-divisor on X. Then

If π is finite, then Nσ(π*D) = π*Nσ(D).

If π is only generically finite, but D is an [formula]-Cartier [formula]-divisor, then π*Nσ(π*D) = ( deg π)  ·  Nσ(D).

If π is finite, then Nσ(π*D)  ≤  π*Nσ(D) because H0(Y,π*D)  ⊇  π*H0(X,D). When π is only generically finite and D is [formula]-Cartier, the same argument and the projection formula (cf. [\cite=fulton84]) prove π*Nσ(π*D)  ≤  ( deg π)  ·  Nσ(D). On the other hand [formula], and π*Pσ(π*D) is big and movable by Lemma [\ref=lem:movprop].iii). By Lemma [\ref=lem:movprop].ii) it follows that [formula] and hence [formula]. Therefore in both i) and ii),

[formula]

When π is finite, this forces equality in Nσ(π*D)  ≤  π*Nσ(D).

If D is a big [formula]-divisor on the proper normal variety X, and E  ≥  0 with Supp(E)  ⊂  Supp(Nσ(D)), then and

[formula]

We argue just as in [\cite=nakayama04] and [\cite=nakayama04]. When X is not projective, we replace the ample A from the proof of [\cite=nakayama04] by a divisor ample in codimension 1.

Divisorial augmented base locus

The augmented base locus of an [formula]-Cartier [formula]-divisor on a normal complex projective variety X is defined in [\cite=elmnp06] as [formula], where A is an ample [formula]-divisor and E is an effective [formula]-Cartier [formula]-divisor. For normal proper varieties, we mimic this construction by using divisors ample in codimension 1. The resulting subset is a good analogue of the augmented base locus in codimension 1.

Let D be a big [formula]-divisor on a normal proper variety X. The divisorial augmented base locus of D is the divisorial component [formula] of

[formula]

with the intersection being taken over all decompositions D = A + E with A an [formula]-divisor, ample in codimension 1, and E an effective [formula]-divisor.

The next lemma implies that if X is projective then [formula] equals the divisorial part of [formula] and that we can also compute [formula] in terms of just one divisor that is ample in codimension 1.

Let X be a normal proper variety. Let D be a big [formula]-divisor and let A be an [formula]-divisor that is ample in codimension 1 on X. Then [formula] is the divisorial component of the intersection of the supports of all [formula] for all ε > 0.

Let U denote the above intersection. Its index set is a subset of the one in [\eqref=eq:bdpdef], therefore [formula]. Let now Γ be a prime divisor which is a component of the supports of all [formula] for all sufficiently small ε > 0. Let D = A' + E with A' ample in codimension 1 and E  ≥  0. By Lemma [\ref=concretesigma].i), for all sufficiently small ε > 0 there exists [formula] such that A' - Bε  ≥  0 and [formula]. Then

[formula]

Consequently Γ is a component of Supp(E).

The relationship between [formula] and the Zariski decomposition is given by the following.

Let X be a normal proper variety. Let D be a big [formula]-divisor and let A be an [formula]-divisor which is ample in codimension 1 on X. Then

[formula]

for all sufficiently small ε > 0.

Note that since Supp(Nσ(D - εA)) is a closed set, for any sufficiently small ε  >  0 the sets Supp(Nσ(D - εA)) all coincide. Thus we may show that [formula] coincides with the intersection over all sufficiently small ε  >  0 of the sets Supp(Nσ(D - εA)).

By Theorem [\ref=volprop].iii), we see that D - εA is big for sufficiently small ε > 0. Let Γ be a prime divisor on X. Assume σΓ(D - εA) = 0. Lemma [\ref=concretesigma].ii) shows that [formula] for some [formula]. Therefore [formula]. The reverse inclusion is straightforward from the previous lemma and the definition of σΓ(D - εA).
