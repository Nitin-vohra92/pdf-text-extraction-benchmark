On the congruence [formula]

Introduction

For a prime p and an integer λ let J(p;λ) be the number of solutions of the congruence

[formula]

Note that the period of the function xx modulo p is p(p - 1), which is larger than the range in congruence [\eqref=eqn:MainCongr].

From the works of Crocker [\cite=Cr] and Somer [\cite=Som] it is known that there are at least ⌊(p - 1) / 2⌋ and at most 3p / 4 + p1 / 2 + o(1) incongruent values of xx mod p when 1  ≤  x  ≤  p - 1. There are several conjectures in [\cite=HM] related to this function.

New approaches to study J(p;λ) were given by Balog, Broughan and Shparlinski, see [\cite=BBSh] and [\cite=BBSh2]. In the special case λ = 1 it was shown in [\cite=BBSh] that J(p;1) < p1 / 3  +  o(1). This estimate was slightly improved in our work [\cite=JG0] to the bound J(p;1)  ≪  p1 / 3  -  c for some absolute constant c > 0. Note that the method of [\cite=JG0] applies for a more general exponential congruences, however, the constant c there becomes too small. In the present paper we use a different approach and prove the following results.

The number J(p;1) of solutions of the congruence

[formula]

satisfies [formula].

Here and below we use the notation [formula] to denote that A < Bpo(1); that is, for any ε > 0 there exists c = c(ε) > 0 such that A  <  cBpε. As usual, ord  λ denotes the multiplicative order of λ, that is, the smallest positive integer t such that [formula] We recall that ord  λ|p - 1.

Uniformly over t|p - 1, we have, as p  →    ∞  ,

[formula]

In the range t < p1 / 3 our Theorem [\ref=thm:Main2] improves some results of the aforementioned works [\cite=BBSh] and [\cite=BBSh2]. Note that in the case t = 1 the estimate of Theorem [\ref=thm:Main1] is stronger. In fact, following the argument that we use in the proof of Theorem  [\ref=thm:Main1] it is posible to improve Theorem [\ref=thm:Main2] in specific small ranges of t.

Let now I(p) denote the number of solutions of the congruence

[formula]

There is the following relationship between I(p) and J(p;λ):

[formula]

We modify one of the arguments of [\cite=BBSh] and obtain the following refinement on  [\cite=BBSh].

We have, as p  →    ∞  ,

[formula]

In order to prove our results, we first reduce the problem to estimates of exponential sums over subgroups. In the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:Main1] we use Shteinikov's result from [\cite=Sht], while in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:Main2] we use Shkredov's result from [\cite=Shk] (see, Lemma [\ref=lem:Sht] and Lemma [\ref=lem:Shk] below).

In what follows, [formula] is the field of residue classes modulo p. The elements of [formula] we associate with their concrete representatives from [formula]. For an integer m coprime to p by m* we denote the smallest positive integer such that [formula]. We also use the abbreviation

Lemmas

Let

[formula]

Then for any fixed constant [formula] the number J of solutions of the congruence

[formula]

satisfies

[formula]

In particular, if n = dt < p and M = p / d, then we have the bound

[formula]

We have

[formula]

Since for a given integer μ the congruence

[formula]

has at most n solutions, there exists a positive integer λ0 < p such that

[formula]

where J1 is the number of solutions of the congruence

[formula]

It follows that

[formula]

Since the left hand side of this equation does not exceed Mk, we get that |y|  ≤  Mk / p. Hence, for some fixed y0 we have

[formula]

where J2 is the number of solutions of the equation

[formula]

Hence, from the bound for the divisor function it follows that [formula]. Thus,

[formula]

and the result follows.

Let Hd be the subgroup of [formula] of order d. From the classical estimates for exponential sums over subgroups it is known that

[formula]

For a wide range of d this bound has been improved in a serious of works. Here, we need the results due to Shteinikov [\cite=Sht] (see Lemma [\ref=lem:Sht] below) and Shkredov [\cite=Shk] (see Lemma [\ref=lem:Shk] below). They will be used in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:Main1] and Theorem [\ref=thm:Main2], respectively.

Let Hd be the subgroup of [formula] of order d < p1 / 2. Then for any integer [formula] the following bound holds:

[formula]

Let Hd be the subgroup of [formula] of order d < p2 / 3. Then for any integer [formula] the following bound holds:

[formula]

The following two results are due to Balog, Broughan and Shparlinski from [\cite=BBSh] and [\cite=BBSh2].

Uniformly over t|p - 1, we have, as p  →    ∞  ,

[formula]

Uniformly over t|p - 1 and all integers λ with gcd (λ,p) = 1 and ord  λ = t, we have, as p  →    ∞  ,

[formula]

We also need the following lemma.

Let a,x be positive integers and let d =  gcd (x,p - 1). Then [formula]

This lemma is well-known and the proof is simple. Indeed, if ind  a is indice of a with respect to some primitive root g modulo p, then,

[formula]

Therefore, [formula], whence [formula].

The following lemma is also well-known; see, for example, exercise and solutions to chapter 3 in Vinogradov's book [\cite=Vin] for even a more general statement.

For any integers U and V > U the following bound holds:

[formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:Main1]

We have

[formula]

where Jd' is the number of solutions of [\eqref=eqn:Th1] with gcd (x,p - 1) = d. It then follows by Lemma [\ref=lem:easy] that

[formula]

where Jd is the number of solutions of the congruence

[formula]

We have therefore,

[formula]

where

[formula]

The trivial estimate Jd  ≤  p / d implies that

[formula]

To estimate R2 we use Lemma [\ref=lem:CongrMoment] with k = 3 and get To estimate R3 we use Lemma [\ref=lem:CongrMoment] with k = 2 and get Thus,

[formula]

Hence, there exists d|p - 1 with d < p3 / 7 such that

[formula]

Applying Lemma [\ref=lem:CongrMoment] with k = 2, we get

[formula]

Let now Hd be the subgroup of [formula] of order d. We recall that Jd is the number of solutions of the congruence

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

It then follows that

[formula]

Separating the term corresponding to a = 0 and using Lemma [\ref=lem:Sht] for [formula], we get

[formula]

Using Lemma [\ref=lem:Vin], we get the following bound for the double:

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

Comparing this estimate with [\eqref=eqn:_J_d_1] we obtain

[formula]

Incorporating this in [\eqref=eqn:R_lesssim_Jd], we get the desired result.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:Main2]

In view of Lemma [\ref=lem:BBSh], it suffices to deal with the case t < p1 / 3.

Since [formula], it follows from [\eqref=eqn:MainCongr] that

[formula]

Hence, denoting d =  gcd (x,(p - 1) / t) and using Lemma [\ref=lem:easy] we obtain that

[formula]

where Td is the number of solutions of the congruence

[formula]

By the trivial estimate Td  ≤  p / d we have

[formula]

Furthermore, applying Lemma [\ref=lem:CongrMoment] with k = 2, we get

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

Recall that t < p1 / 3, thus dt|p - 1 and dt < p2 / 3.

Let Hdt be the subgroup of [formula] of order dt. Since Td is the number of solutions of the congruence

[formula]

it follows that

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

Separating the term corresponding to a = 0 and using Lemma [\ref=lem:Shk] for [formula] (with d replaced by dt), we get

[formula]

Applying Lemma [\ref=lem:Vin] to the double sum, as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:Main1], we obtain for d < p1 / 3 the bound

[formula]

Thus,

[formula]

Putting this into [\eqref=eqn:preultimateTh2], we conclude the proof.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:Main3]

We follow the arguments of [\cite=BBSh] with some modifications. We have

[formula]

It then follows that for some fixed order t|p - 1 we have

[formula]

We can split the range of J(p;λ) into O( log p) dyadic intervals. Then, for some 1  ≤  M  ≤  p, we have

[formula]

where |A| is the cardinality of the set

[formula]

From Lemma [\ref=lem:BBSh1] we have

[formula]

On the other hand, by Lemma [\ref=lem:BBSh] we also have

[formula]

If t < p1 / 2, then using [\eqref=eqn:I(p)<AMM] we get

[formula]

and the result follows. If t > p1 / 2, then we get [formula]. Therefore, using [\eqref=eqn:I(p)<AMM] and [\eqref=eqn:M<pt] we get

[formula]

This proves Theorem [\ref=thm:Main3].
