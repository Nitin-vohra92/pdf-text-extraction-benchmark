Search for ultralight scalar dark matter with atomic spectrosopy

Dark matter (DM) makes up the majority of matter density in our Universe. Its ubiquitous abundance can be measured through its gravitational influence, but little is known about the microphysical properties of the DM particle(s), such as the mass, spin, and any nongravitational interactions. If the DM is bosonic rather than fermionic, it can have a sub-eV mass and such high occupation numbers that it acts more like a classical wave--with frequency equal to its mass--than a particle. Light bosonic dark matter has a natural production mechanism, namely early-universe misalignment of the field relative to the minimum of its potential [\cite=Preskill:1982cy] [\cite=Dine:1982ah] [\cite=Abbott:1982af]. Several motivated candidates in this category exist in the literature, most notably the QCD axion [\cite=Peccei:1977hh] [\cite=Weinberg:1977ma] [\cite=Wilczek:1977pj] and other axion-like particles, which, as parity-odd pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons (PNGBs) of compact symmetry groups, primarily have derivative interactions with matter [\cite=Graham:2013gfa]. Light, parity-even bosons may also arise as PNGBs of noncompact groups such as those of scale, conformal, or shift symmetries, the most famous examples of which are dilatons [\cite=Taylor:1988nw] [\cite=Ellis:1987qs] [\cite=Damour:1994zq]. Small explicit breakings of these symmetries may induce nonderivative operators for the scalar fields, such as mass terms and higher-dimensional operators coupling them to matter.

We focus on ultralight scalar fields φ with couplings to the (square of the) electromagnetic field tensor Fμν:

[formula]

where [formula], GN is Newton's constant, and e  ≈  0.303 is the electromagnetic gauge coupling (we use units in which c  =  1). The interaction is normalized such that de  =  1 yields an attractive force of gravitational strength between electromagnetic energy densities at distances smaller than the inverse mass ([formula]) through scalar φ exchange [\cite=Damour:2010rp]. Couplings de  ≪  1 generically arise if quantum gravity effects weakly break an underlying global symmetry of φ near the Planck scale ~  G- 1 / 2N [\cite=Kallosh:1995hi]. Quantum corrections proportional to d2e and naturalness considerations together suggest a minimum mass-squared for φ. However, given the existing hierarchy problems of the Standard Model, we remain agnostic to this issue and consider the full mφ-de parameter space (see Ref. [\cite=Arvanitaki:2014faa] for more discussion).

Equivalence principle (EP) tests such as the Eöt-Wash experiment [\cite=Schlamminger:2007ht] and Lunar Laser Ranging [\cite=Williams:2004qba] constrain the coupling de to be much less than unity: [formula] at 95% confidence level (CL) for [formula]. This limit will likely be improved to [formula] with atom-interferometry techniques [\cite=Dimopoulos:2006nk]. The EP-violating force that φ mediates scales as |de|2, making vast improvements to these limits challenging.

Light scalar fields do not behave as perfect cold DM on short length scales, where their density perturbations have a nonzero sound speed. For [formula], they would have inhibited cosmological structure growth [\cite=Marsh:2013ywa] [\cite=Hlozek:2014lca] [\cite=Bozek:2014uqa] in conflict with observations, though these bounds disappear if φ only makes up a small fraction of the dark matter. Because of its effect on structure formation, light scalar dark matter in the 10- 24-[formula] range has been proposed [\cite=Hu:2000ke] [\cite=Marsh:2015wka] to solve several long-standing astrophysical puzzles, such as the core-cusp, missing satellite, and too-big-to-fail problems [\cite=Weinberg:2013aya]. DM self-interactions such as cubic or quartic potential terms likewise produce pressure contributions [\cite=Turner:1983he]; if they are sufficiently small in the early universe, they can be neglected in the present era [\cite=Arvanitaki:2014faa].

In Ref. [\cite=Arvanitaki:2014faa], it was pointed out that the interaction in Eq. ([\ref=eq:lagrangian]) leads to a fractional oscillation in the fine-structure constant if φ comprises the dark matter:

[formula]

with [formula] and δ an arbitrary phase. The amplitude φ0 depends on the ambient dark matter energy density [formula] as:

[formula]

The amplitude φ0 scales as the square root of the energy density, so even if φ makes up a tiny fraction of the DM energy density, the oscillation in Eq. ([\ref=eq:alphavar]) may still be detectable. The field oscillation has an angular frequency equal to mφ, and a coherence time of order 2π  /  mφv2, with v  ~  10- 3 the velocity dispersion of the DM in our Galaxy [\cite=calcaxion]. The amplitude in Eq. ([\ref=eq:amplitude]) scales inversely with the frequency of the oscillation, motivating measurements of this effect at low frequencies. Our measurements are sensitive to angular frequencies below [formula], or DM masses [formula], for which we can take the DM oscillations to be coherent on the time scales of our experiment. At angular frequencies higher than [formula], experiments with low noise floors such as gravitational-wave observatories and other resonant detectors may also reach sensitivity beyond existing bounds [\cite=Arvanitaki:2014faa], despite the smaller oscillation amplitude.

Transition energies in atoms are convenient observables to look for low-frequency signals of changes in masses and couplings, and have been used to look for linear drifts in α [\cite=Leefer2013a] [\cite=Rosenband28032008] [\cite=PhysRevLett.98.070801] [\cite=PhysRevLett.113.210801] [\cite=Huntemannn2014] [\cite=Guena2012] [\cite=Tobar2013]. Atoms are exactly reproducible systems across long time scales, their electronic structure solely determined by masses and couplings of the Standard Model. While experimental imperfections can lead to fluctuations in observed transition frequencies, recent advances in optical metrology techniques have allowed for the determination of transition frequencies with stabilities and accuracies approaching δν  /  ν  ~  10- 18 [\cite=Hinkley13092013] [\cite=Bloom:2013uoa] [\cite=Huntemann:2012zz] [\cite=Oskay:2006zz] [\cite=PhysRevLett.104.070802]. In this work, we perform a spectroscopic analysis in two isotopes of dysprosium to search for the coupling in Eq. ([\ref=eq:lagrangian]) through the effect of Eq. ([\ref=eq:alphavar]). In the remainder of this Letter, we describe the atomic level structure of dysprosium and the experimental setup, followed by an account of the data analysis. No statistically significant oscillation consistent with α variation is observed; new limits are placed on couplings of DM lighter than 10- 15 eV.

Dysprosium (Dy) is a rare-earth element with nuclear charge Z  =  66 and 7 stable isotopes, of which we use those with atomic masses A  =  162 ~ & ~ 164. A large number of valence electrons endows Dy with a complex energy level structure, including a nearly degenerate pair of opposite-parity states, denoted A and B for the even and odd states, respectively [\cite=Dzuba1986]. Spectroscopy of the radio-frequency (rf) electric-dipole transition between A and B revealed that their energy splitting corresponds to frequencies less than 2000 MHz, and that in some isotopes, A is the more energetic state (162Dy), while in others (164Dy), B has the higher energy [\cite=Budker1994]. Figure [\ref=fig:levels] depicts the relevant energy level structure, with a focus on 162Dy and 164Dy.

The energy splitting between the nearly degenerate pair is extremely sensitive to variation of the fine-structure constant. A change in α yields a frequency shift δν  =    ±  νδα  δα  /  α with [formula] [\cite=Dzuba2008]. By comparison, optical frequency measurements with trapped atoms and ions have similar absolute sensitivities to variation in α, but the near-degeneracy of the A and B levels relaxes requirements on the fractional accuracy and stability of the frequency reference. Spectroscopy in Dy resulted in one of the most stringent constraints on a present-day, linear variation of α at the level of [formula] yr- 1, the best limit on a possible coupling of α to gravitational potential [\cite=Leefer2013a], and stringent limits on violation of Lorentz invariance for electrons [\cite=Leefer:2013yaa].

A beam of dysprosium atoms is generated by an oven operating at 1400 K, and prepared in state B by two laser excitations followed by a spontaneous decay, as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:levels]. The lifetime of state B is long enough that it can be considered metastable in this experiment [\cite=Budker1994]. An rf electric field, whose frequency is compared with a cesium reference and a GPS-stabilized rubidium oscillator, then excites atoms to state A, which decays to the ground state through several channels, one of them emitting a 564-nm photon. This fluorescence is detected with a photomultiplier tube (PMT), allowing the resonant frequency to be determined by maximizing fluorescence with respect to the electric-field frequency. A simplified illustration of our setup is shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:apparatus], and more details can be found in Refs. [\cite=Cingoz2008] [\cite=Weber2013]. The optimal statistical precision is [formula], where γ / (2π)  ≈  20 kHz is the natural linewidth of the transition (see bottom panel of Fig. [\ref=fig:levels]), [formula] is the number of fluorescent photons per unit time, and τ is the total integration time. An estimate of [formula] gives a statistical measurement precision of [formula]. In the actual experiment, the statistical background is dominated by leakage into the PMT of blackbody radiation and scattered light from the 669-nm excitation laser, limiting the statistical precision for 162Dy and 164Dy to [formula]. This corresponds to a sensitivity of δα  /  α  ≈  2  ·  10- 15 after one second of integration, and improves as [formula].

Our data consist of transition frequency measurements on 162Dy and 164Dy--denoted by ν162  ≈  235 MHz and ν164  ≈  754 MHz, respectively--recorded at different times ti. The energy hierarchy of states A and B is reversed between these isotopes, which means that the response of their transition frequencies to a variation of α is opposite in sign, shown diagramatically in Fig. [\ref=fig:levels]. An increase in α would increase the transition frequency between the A and B states in 162Dy, but decrease it in 164Dy. With measurements in both isotopes, two types of data sets can be constructed: one "out-of-phase" signal data set maximally sensitive to α variation, the other an "in-phase" control channel data combination which can be checked for systematic effects. Because each isotope's transition frequency was not observed simultaneously, any systematic effects in the control data need to be subtracted to account for potential spectral leakage of these effects into the signal data.

Measurements were performed on 10 different days over a two-year period (2010-2012), as in Ref. [\cite=Leefer2013a]. We split up the data into two different sets, one long-term data set (hereafter "LT") of combined measurements on the first 9 measurement days, and a short-term data set ("ST") of the last day of measurements. In the LT data set, the measurements of ν162 and ν164 are averaged over the course of each of the 9 days, such that each day-averaged measurement is dominated by a systematic error of 0.48 Hz (1 Hz on the first day, due to a different experimental configuration). After subtracting the overall mean in both LT sets, we define the LT signal data set as [formula], sensitive to variations of α. Adding the frequencies from each isotope in phase defines the LT control data set [formula]. The ST data set comprises 2303 measurements of ν162 and ν164 taken over a span of [formula] on 19 October 2012. Data from each isotope are mean-subtracted, and combined into the ST signal time series data as [formula]. Similar to the LT data combination, we also construct a ST control data set [formula].

Our aim is to search for harmonic variations in the dysprosium transition frequency data. A signal or limit at an angular frequency ω can then be converted into a signal or limit for scalar dark matter with coupling de and mass mφ≃ω. We perform linear least-squares analysis (LLA) on [formula] and [formula] with waveforms of type [formula] and [formula] a constant offset . The highest analyzed angular frequency [formula] is taken to be [formula], with [formula] the shortest time between measurements. LLA can also capture variations at angular frequencies smaller than the inverse time span of the data set T, when the waveform becomes essentially a frequency drift (near a node) or a quadratic frequency change (near an antinode).

From the best-fit LLA waveform, we construct a normalized power spectrum:

[formula]

where σ2ν is the average variance of ν(ti), and N0 is the number of data points. For high angular frequencies [formula], the LLA power spectrum reduces to the modified periodogram of Ref. [\cite=Scargle:1982bw], and has simple statistical properties for white noise with equal uncertainties on each data point (a good first-order approximation for both of our data sets). In this limit, the power P(ω) at any frequency has a simple cumulative distribution function (CDF) which is ω-independent: [formula]. It follows that the expected median, and the 68% and 95% confidence intervals are 0.69,

[formula]

, respectively. At intermediate and low angular frequencies [formula], the statistical behavior of the power is quite complicated, and we simulated its expected distribution with Monte Carlo (MC) using the same errors as on the data.

We set a 95% CL upper bound on the power by assuming the observed best-fit oscillation is a true signal, adding white noise via MC many times, and taking the 95th-percentile value of the combined power. At high frequencies, an approximate, analytic expression for this value can be obtained [\cite=1975ApJS...29..285G]. In the presence of a real signal with power [formula], the CDF of the periodogram is modified to [formula], where [formula]. Given an observed power [formula], we define our 95%-CL upper limit [formula] by [formula]. At very low angular frequencies ω  ≪  2π / T, where the periodogram statistics are invalid, the expected limit on the power (amplitude) scales as ω- 4 (ω- 2) because one cannot exclude being near an antinode of an oscillation.

In Fig. [\ref=fig:power], we plot the results of this analysis for the ST data set. Excess power is observed in the control data--sensitive only to in-phase fluctuations of ν162 and ν164--at high significance: [formula]. We could not conclusively identify the source of this monochromatic variation, observed independently in both isotopes with approximately equal amplitude, phase, and period of [formula]. Its best-fit amplitude of [formula] is comparable to the magnitude of a systematic error due to unstable electronic offsets [\cite=Leefer2013a], while its period may point to room temperature fluctuations. Variations due to reference clock instabilities are excluded because they would produce a larger effect in 164Dy than in 162Dy. Upon subtracting the best-fit waveform to the variation in the control data, which partially leaked into the signal data in neighboring frequency bands, the ST corrected power spectra were compatible with white-noise fluctuations. For the raw LT data, the observed power spectra in both the control and signal data were also consistent with white noise.

Assuming the field φ comprises all of the DM, power values can be translated to absolute values of the scalar coupling to photons via:

[formula]

where [formula] is the aforementioned sensitivity coefficient to fractional variations of α. Note that any bound on |de| scales only as the square root of the energy density in the φ field via Eq. ([\ref=eq:amplitude]). Figure [\ref=fig:limit] shows the 95%-CL upper limit on |de| as a function of mass mφ≃ω for both data sets. In particular, the observed limit from the ST data is the limit curve of Fig. [\ref=fig:power] transformed with Eq. ([\ref=eq:delim]). For masses [formula], our ST limits on |de| exceed those set by EP tests. In our most sensitive mass window--[formula], which coincides with the astrophysically motivated mass range [\cite=Marsh:2015wka]--we exclude DM couplings down to de  ≈  4.2  ·  10- 8 times gravitational strength.

We have presented the best limit on neutral scalar dark matter coupling to photons for masses below [formula]. It is also the first limit of its kind--exploiting the response of atomic transition energies to tiny fractional oscillations of the fine-structure constant--and we hope many similar searches will follow. Optical clock systems will likely improve on our limit of |de| with sufficient data. Combined with existing microwave and future nuclear clocks, one can also achieve sensitivity to fractional variations in the electron, quark, and proton masses, expanding the potential discovery reach of light scalar dark matter to other couplings [\cite=Arvanitaki:2014faa]. Small-scale precision experiments can thus search for cosmic dark matter with feeble interactions generated at the highest energy scales.
