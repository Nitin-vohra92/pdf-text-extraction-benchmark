Nature of the Extreme Ultraluminous X-ray Sources

Introduction

Our Universe is populated with black holes (BH) and neutron stars (NS) in various binary configurations. In our Galaxy, many such binaries show significant X-ray activity suggestive of a mass transfer and accretion onto the compact star. X-ray luminosities of only two Galactic X-ray binaries (XRBs) exceed ~  10[formula] (approximately the Eddington limit for a 10 [formula] BH) in GRS 1915+105 [\citep=Fender04] and possibly in SS 433 if the system were observed along the jet axis [\citep=Fabrika06].

However, a large population of extra-galactic point-like X-ray sources with luminosities in excess of ~  10[formula] has been identified [\citep=Fabbiano89] [\citep=Liu11] [\citep=Walton11]. These so-called Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULX) are off-nuclear and therefore accretion onto a supermassive BH ([formula]) can be excluded as the source of their luminosity. Instead, the two most popular scenarios to explain their nature include binary systems hosting (i) a stellar mass BH accreting at a super-Eddington rate, or (ii) an intermediate mass BH (IMBH) and sub-Eddington accretion [\citep=Colbert99]. In the latter case, formation of BHs heavier than [formula] presents a problem for current models of stellar evolution. Although, it has been suggested that such IMBHs may be formed in dense globular clusters [\citep=Miller02] or even as a result of stellar evolution of very massive stars [\citep=Crowther10] [\citep=Yusof13].

The super-Eddington BH accretion invoked in the stellar origin scenario remains still a relatively poorly understood regime. However, several theoretical mechanisms able to breach the Eddington limit have been proposed, e.g., beaming and/or hyper-accretion allowed by non-uniform escape of photons from accretion flow ("photonic bubbles") [\citep=King01] [\citep=Begelman06] [\citep=Poutanen07] [\citep=King08], as well as a contribution of rotation powered pulsars and pulsar wind nebulae to the ULX population [\citep=Medvedev13].

Robust observational constrains on the mass of the accretor in some ULXs [\citep=Motch14] indicate that indeed super-Eddington accretion onto stellar-origin BHs is realised in nature. Moreover, [\citet=Bachetti14] investigating the M82 X-2 source have demonstrated that the super-Eddington accretion is also possible in XRBs hosting a NS. Additionally, some sources transit relatively fast between the super- and sub-Eddington regimes on timescales as short as a few days to a week [\citep=Walton13] [\citep=Bachetti13]. Such short timescales are in contradiction with IMBH accretors [\citep=Lasota15b].

Nevertheless, it has been speculated that the brightest ULXs, with luminosities [formula] may be candidate IMBHs [\citep=Sutton12]. Recently, compelling evidence, based on quasi-periodic oscillations (QPO), was presented in support of a [formula] BH in M82 X-1 [\citep=Pasham14]. However, it was also suggested that these QPOs may be harmonics of pulsar rotation period [\citep=Kluzniak15]. Moreover, [\citet=Sutton15] demonstrated that the IMBH candidate in IC 4320 is actually a background AGN. To date HLX-1 with [formula] [\citep=Farrell11] is the brightest known ULX [\citep=Servillat11].

We approach the ULX issue from the standpoint of one particular evolutionary model for binary evolution. We consider only the far end of the ULX luminosity space, [formula], and we refer to the sources potentially able to reach these luminosities as extreme ULXs (EULXs). We explore the possibility that EULXs are binary systems with Roche lobe overflow mass transfer rates that highly exceed classical Eddington limit. For the purpose of this proof-of-concept study, we assume that the transferred mass is efficiently accreted onto a compact object and converted to X-ray luminosity in the full range of possible mass accretion rates. This is in contrast with the generally accepted view that the conversion efficiency decreases with increasing mass accretion rate [\citep=Poutanen07]. However, if mass is lost during accretion process and even if conversion into X-ray luminosity is not fully efficient, a geometrical beaming can provide large X-ray luminosities for sources considered in our study.

Model

We employ the binary population synthesis code, StarTrack [\citep=Belczynski08], with updates as discussed in [\citet=Dominik14]. We employed following initial conditions: [\citet=Kroupa93] broken power law for initial mass function (primary mass between 6 - [formula]), flat mass ratio distribution [\citep=Kobulnicky06], flat in logarithm distribution of separations [\citep=Abt83] and thermal distribution of eccentricities [\citep=Duquennoy91].

We use the BOINC platform for volunteer computing in our program "Universe@home" (http://universeathome.pl) to obtain a large number of X-ray binaries (N = 109 of massive binary systems were evolved by volunteers). The X-ray binary is defined as a system hosting a donor star transferring mass via Roche lobe overflow (RLOF) to a compact object companion (NS or BH). For any given system our evolutionary models provide the donor RLOF mass transfer rate, [formula]. The accretion rate onto the compact object, [formula], is estimated in three different ways from the mass transfer rate (see below).

We search for evolutionary channels that allow for the formation of binaries with highest possible RLOF mass transfer rates onto stellar-origin BHs and NSs. Conservatively, we model only solar metallicity [\citep=Villante14] and we allow initial mass function (IMF) to extend only to [formula]. Note that lower metallicity and higher mass stars may form massive ([formula]) black holes in binary systems [\citep=Belczynski14].

To estimate RLOF mass transfer rate  we evaluate donor properties and various angular momentum loss mechanisms in a given binary as described in [\citet=Belczynski08]. It is highly uncertain how RLOF mass transfer rate is to be converted to X-ray luminosity, and we discuss this issue below.

The gravitational energy of the RLOFing material becomes converted into radiation in an accretion disk formed around the compact object [\citep=Shakura73]. There are a number of effects that have a pivotal influence on the  to  conversion process in high mass-accretion rate disks (see Fig. [\ref=fig:graph]).

The first conundrum to consider is the role of winds launched from the disk surface. Such winds have been ubiquitously detected in high mass accretion rate disk-dominated states of XRBs [\citep=Ponti12] [\citep=Ponti15]. Winds are able to remove a substantial fraction of matter that is being transferred through the disk toward the compact object. At the same time, winds carry away the angular momentum and therefore influence the orbital evolution. We introduce the quantity  to describe the fraction of  that is not affected by the disk winds ().

Secondly, not all of the photons produced in the vicinity of the accretor get emitted from the disk. Some of them are dragged by the inflowing matter and fall onto the compact object. As a result of this "photon trapping" effect (e.g., [\citeauthor=Ohsuga07] [\citeyear=Ohsuga07], hereafter [\citetalias=Ohsuga07]; [\citeauthor=Abramowicz08] [\citeyear=Abramowicz08]; [\citeauthor=Narayan12] [\citeyear=Narayan12]; [\citeauthor=Sadowski15] [\citeyear=Sadowski15], hereafter [\citetalias=Sadowski15]), the observed X-ray luminosity is reduced. To include this and other currently unknown processes that may lower  we introduced the  parameter.

Finally, we took into account the processes that may increase the observed  due to non-isotropic emission. We utilise the  factor which in addition to the beaming [\citep=King01] may also include a contribution due to disk geometry, black hole spin, column accretion in magnetised NS, etc. The beamed emission will always exceed the isotropic one ([formula]; as an example, if the emission goes into a cone of opening angle [formula], [formula] or [formula], it will correspond to  [formula], [formula], and [formula], respectively). However, a beamed source will be visible only from the directions enclosed by the cone, and thus its detection probability will be lower than that of an isotropic emitter.

The XRB X-ray luminosity is calculated as

[formula]

where the radius of the accretor, Racc, is 10 km for a NS and 3 Schwarzschild radii for a BH, ε gives a conversion efficiency of gravitational binding energy to radiation associated with accretion onto a NS (surface accretion ε = 1.0) and onto a BH (disk accretion ε = 0.5), [formula] is the total efficiency of the accretion flow, and η0 is the radiative efficiency of a standard thin disk.

In our simulations we define a potential EULX source as the one with [formula] erg s- 1.

The reference model

In our reference model we assume: no winds ([formula]), no photon trapping ([formula]), no beaming ([formula]), and always efficient mass accretion rate-into-luminosity conversion (η0 as in the standard thin disk). We adopt this condition even for very high RLOF mass transfer rates. This is quite arbitrary, however, our goal was to estimate the highest luminosities potentially reachable by an X-ray binary system without invoking strong beaming. On the other hand, η  =  η0 may also correspond to a situation when a significant part of the  is lost from the system ([formula]) or  is lowered due to photon trapping ([formula]) but the beaming compensates these effects ([formula]). Numerical simulations [\citepalias=Sadowski15] suggest that  is indeed small. However, may reach 103-104 for the cone opening angles of the order of a few degrees.

Therefore, with our reference model we obtain the maximum potential X-ray luminosity of a given binary system if the non-standard accretion disk effects are negligible or compensate each other.

The Ohsuga model

Next, we have considered a BH accretion case with [formula] ([formula]), and [formula] constrained following the results of [\citetalias=Ohsuga07] who performed global, axisymmetric simulations of super-critical disks with the αP viscosity, including effects of outflowing winds and photon trapping. We use the parametrisation of the [\citetalias=Ohsuga07] results ( as a function of ) derived in [\citet=Belczynski08a],

[formula]

where [formula] is the critical mass accretion rate. To obtain X-ray luminosities we utilised the Eq. [\ref=eq:l_x] using  as provided by Eq. [\ref=eq:macc_ohsuga] and substituting [formula]. For a [formula] BH accretor we obtain 2.8 times lower luminosity if [formula] and 6.7 times lower if [formula]. For illustration, if the collimation angle of the outflow is [formula], as in NS simulations of [\citet=Ohsuga07b], the corresponding [formula] will be equal 66. The accretion onto NSs is limited to the classical Eddington limit in this model [\citep=Ohsuga07b]. [formula] is calculated as in Eq. [\ref=eq:l_x]. We note that we have extrapolated results of the original calculations of [\citet=Ohsuga07] to the range of mass transfer rates we have in our simulations.

The Sdowski model

Finally, we have experimented with the constraints on the [formula] and Lx following the recent results of [\citetalias=Sadowski15]. The accretion rate at the BH horizon was found to be only a fraction of the RLOF rate,

[formula]

where Rout and Rin = 20Rg [\citep=sadowski+koral2] are the outer and inner radii of the wind emitting region, respectively. It is hard to estimate the location of the outer edge, so we assumed a constant fraction Rwind  /  Rout  =  0.01 (the wind probably is not emitted out to the edge of the disk), which corresponds to [formula]. In this model we utilised a different formula for X-ray luminosity which already accounts for the effects of photon trapping and beaming,

[formula]

where θ is the viewing angle, [formula] is the Eddington accretion rate. In our simulations we incorporated θ in the range [formula] - [formula] (the opening angle is [formula]). This will correspond to [formula] in our reference model. In [\citet=Sadowski15] model we get different luminosities for different viewing angles, which was included in our simulations to calculate probabilities of observing a particular system as the EULX. Even though the [\citetalias=Sadowski15] model was constructed for systems with BHs, we assumed that the same prescription is valid for the NSs accretors. We note that the results of [\citetalias=Ohsuga07] can be put in the framework of this model by taking Rout  ≈  50Rg, which is approximately the effective circularization radius (and the outer edge of the disk) of the gas injected into their simulation box. We note that the Eq. [\ref=eq:l_as] was obtained by [\citet=Sadowski15] for supermassive BH, but we extrapolated it to the stellar mass ones.

Results

Under the least restricting assumption (no limit on accretion rate, η  =  η0) our EULX rate/number estimates are to be considered upper limits. We find that 1 per 44 billion binaries could potentially be an EULX with a BH accretor, and 1 per 44 billion binaries could potentially be an EULX with a NS accretor. This estimate employs a canonical IMF [\citep=Kroupa03].

Figure [\ref=fig:number] shows our upper limits for the number of EULXs with BH and NS accretors. Note that in our reference model we obtain virtually as many potential EULXs with a NS as with a BH accretor. This estimate accounts for the specific lifetime of each binary in a potential EULX phase. We assumed that the typical density of Milky Way Equivalent galaxies (MWEG) in the local universe is ρMWEG = 0.01 Mpc- 3. Currently, the observations place the only confirmed EULX (HLX-1) at the distance of [formula] [\citep=Wiersema10]. Our predicted upper limit on the number of EULXs at this distance is 90 and 93 binaries with BH and NS accretors, respectively. Both estimates significantly exceed the observed number of sources.

Had we imposed the classical Eddington limit on the mass accretion rate in our reference model, the number of EULXs would be zero for both types of accretors.

Table [\ref=tab:routes] introduces typical companion stars of our EULXs. Majority of the NS EULXs (92%) are found in binaries with Helium star donors: either a ~  1.2 Helium Hertzsprung gap star (HeHG) or ~  1.8 Helium Giant Branch (HeGB) star. The BH EULXs predominantly contain a hydrogen-rich stars that have just evolved beyond main sequence. Typically, these are ~  6 Hertzsprung gap (HG) stars (92.4%). The mass distributions of these most common EULX companions are presented in Fig. [\ref=fig:mass]. Table [\ref=tab:oldroutes] contains typical evolutionary routes that lead to the formation of EULXs.

As a result of implementing the slim disk model of [\citetalias=Ohsuga07], the X-ray luminosities of our systems drop by a factor of at least 2.8. Nevertheless, in this framework it is still possible to significantly exceed the classical Eddington limit. The estimated number of the BH EULX systems decreases to 1 in 105 billion binaries, and the number of BH EULXs within [formula] is 37 (Fig. [\ref=fig:number]).

After employing the model of [\citetalias=Sadowski15] the upper limit on a number of expected EULXs drops to 1 per [formula] binaries. The expected upper limit on the number of EULX systems in the distance range of HLX-1 is 0.004. This is several orders of magnitude lower than in the two other models we tested.

In all cases, the EULX luminosities are achieved during the thermal timescale RLOF. The thermal RLOF mass transfer rate is calculated following [\citet=Kalogera96] as

[formula]

where donor mass, radius and luminosity are expressed in solar units. For example an EULX with a BH can start with a [formula] Hertzsprung gap donor, that has [formula] radius and luminosity of [formula]. The donors in NS systems are evolved (post core He-burning) low-mass Helium stars that on the onset of RLOF have mass [formula], radius [formula] and luminosity [formula]. These parameters allow for very high RLOF mass transfer rates ([formula]-[formula]. If this mass transfer is efficiently converted to X-ray luminosity (η  =  η0), it will correspond to [formula]-[formula]) alas on a very short timescale (τth  ~  102-104 yr).

Typical evolutionary routes that lead to the formation of a potential BH and NS EULX when η  =  η0 are detailed in [\ref=sec:bh]-[\ref=sec:ns]. The corresponding time behaviour of the mass accretion rate and maximum X-ray luminosity are shown in Figs. [\ref=fig:bh] and [\ref=fig:ns].

Black hole EULX

A typical BH EULX system evolves along the evolutionary route BH/1 presented in Table [\ref=tab:oldroutes]. Its evolution begins with a [formula] primary and [formula] secondary on an orbit with separation [formula] and eccentricity e = 0.56. In [formula] the primary starts crossing the Hertzsprung gap (HG). At that point the orbit has expanded to [formula] due to wind mass loss from the primary (now [formula]). After about [formula] and significant radial expansion ([formula]), the primary begins core helium burning (CHeB). As the primary approaches its Roche lobe tidal interactions circularise the orbit. After some additional expansion (radius [formula]) and mass loss the primary ([formula]) initiates a common envelope (CE) phase. Following the envelope ejection the orbit contracts to [formula] and the primary becomes a Wolf-Rayet (WR) star with the mass of [formula]. After [formula] of evolution the primary undergoes a core collapse and forms a [formula] BH. At this time the orbit is rather compact ([formula]) and almost circular (e = 0.04).

After the next [formula] the secondary enters the HG with a mass of [formula] and radius [formula], and expands filling its Roche lobe ([formula]). The mass transfer begins at orbital separation of [formula]. The luminosity of the donor is [formula]. Initially, for a short period of time ([formula]) the mass transfer proceeds on the donor thermal timescale with the RLOF mass transfer rate of [formula] (corresponding to [formula]). We allow the entire transferred material to accrete onto the BH. After mass ratio reversal, the orbit begins to expand in response to the mass transfer and the RLOF slows down. However, for the next [formula] the donor RLOF rate stays above [formula] ([formula]) and the system is still classified as a potential EULX. The evolution of the mass transfer rate throughout the RLOF phase is shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:bh].

The RLOF terminates when the secondary has transferred most of its H-rich envelope to the BH (with the final mass [formula]). The reminder of the secondary envelope is lost in a stellar wind and the secondary becomes a naked helium star with the mass of [formula]. At this point the binary separation is [formula]. The low mass helium secondary ends its evolution in the Type Ib/c supernova explosion forming a low mass NS ([formula]). The natal kick (if significant) is very likely to disrupt the system.

Neutron star EULX

A typical system (NS/1 channel in Table [\ref=tab:oldroutes]) begins as a [formula] primary and a [formula] secondary on a [formula] orbit with an eccentricity e = 0.73. In [formula] the primary enters the HG. After [formula] of expansion on the HG the primary overfills its Roche lobe at the radius of [formula]. The orbit circularises and becomes [formula]. We assume a non-conservative mass transfer in such a case, and allow 50% of transferred material to accumulate on the main sequence secondary. At the end of this RLOF episode the primary becomes a low-mass helium star ([formula]) and the secondary becomes a rejuvenated main sequence star ([formula]). The separation has expanded to [formula]. The low mass helium star evolves and expands after its core He burning is completed. When the radius of the primary ([formula]) exceeds its Roche lobe, the second phase of a non-conservative mass transfer is initiated. At this point the separation is [formula] and the masses are [formula] and 9.45 for the primary and secondary, respectively. After a short phase of a RLOF ([formula]) and after [formula] since the zero age main sequence (ZAMS), the primary explodes in electron capture supernova and forms a low mass NS ([formula]). We assume zero natal kick in this case and the system survives the explosion.

After additional [formula] the [formula] secondary leaves the main sequence and evolves through the HG to become a red giant. Expansion on the red giant branch leads to a RLOF that due to a large mass ratio and a deep convective envelope of the secondary turns into a CE phase. At the onset of the CE, the separation is [formula] and the secondary radius is [formula]. We assume energy balance for the CE [\citep=Webbink84], and obtain the post-CE separation of [formula]. The secondary has lost its entire H-rich envelope and becomes a low-mass helium star ([formula]). After core helium burning, the low mass secondary begins to expand and finally overfills its Roche lobe at the radius of [formula] (the corresponding binary separation is [formula]). At this point the evolved helium star crosses the Helium Hertzsprung Gap and drives a high rate mass transfer ([formula]; [formula]) onto its NS companion. Since in our first approximation we have assumed a fully efficient accretion with no limit, the NS mass quickly increases to [formula]. The RLOF phase is very short ([formula]), and it drives an extremely high mass transfer rate allowing this system to become a potential EULX with a NS accretor (see Fig. [\ref=fig:ns]). Finally, the secondary is depleted of its He-rich envelope and forms a naked CO core that cools off to become a CO WD. After [formula] since the ZAMS we note the formation of a wide NS-WD binary (separation of [formula]), with the gravitational merger time exceeding the Hubble time ([formula]).

Discussion

By allowing that all matter transferred through the RLOF is accreted ( = ) and converted efficiently into X-rays ([formula], where η  =  η0 as in the standard disk), we are able to form a large number of potential BH and NS EULX systems. The EULX phases that we obtain are short ([formula] and [formula] for BH and NS systems, respectively). Nevertheless, we observe them in 0.1% of all simulated binaries. Our parameter space covers all progenitors of X-ray binaries, so every 1 in 1,000 XRBs should become an EULX during its evolution. Luminosities that we find in our simulations exceed [formula]. Such high luminosities are found both for BH and NS accretors. Particularly, the presence of the potential EULXs with NS accretors in our results seems to agree with the recent discovery of the NS ULX system M82 X-2 [\citep=Bachetti14].

Evolution of ULXs with NS accretors was also the topic of a recent work by [\citet=Fragos15]. They used the BSE code for evolution of binaries and the MESA code to calculate precisely the mass transfer phases. They found that NS ULX systems should exist in 13% of M82-like galaxies. They also found donors to be H-rich stars with masses in the 3-[formula] range and 1-3 day orbital periods. The orbits in our NS EULX systems are wider ([formula] days periods) and the companion stars are lighter (1-[formula]) and of a different type (evolved helium stars) than those reported in [\citet=Fragos15]. They obtained mass transfer rates up to [formula] (see their Fig. 4), so they have reached mass transfer rates approximately as high as in our study. However, it needs to be noted that they have studied a much broader population of ULXs, while we have focused only on the brightest ones.

A problem of the maximum X-ray luminosity available from a binary system was considered also by [\citet=Podsiadlowski03]. However, their study was confined to only 11 evolutionary routes, only BH binary systems, and quite limited parameter space (systems composed initially of a primary with mass in the 25 - [formula] range and a 2 - [formula] secondary mass range). [\citet=Rappaport05] extended the simulations of [\citet=Podsiadlowski03] and were able to obtained ULXs with X-ray luminosities of [formula] (see their Fig. 11) for a [formula] BH and [formula] donor and the case B mass transfer (HG donor). This is consistent with our typical BH EULX system. Their secondaries also fill their Roche lobe due to expansion of the envelope, and the ULX phase lasts at most a few  (about [formula] as EULX). However, their grid of parameters is far more sparse than ours, as they simulated only 52 specific evolutionary cases in comparison to our 109 evolutionary routes.

[\citet=Podsiadlowski03] and [\citet=Rappaport05] used detailed evolutionary code to obtained their results, while we have used simplified evolutionary formulae to cover larger parameter space. Both approaches have their advantages. With our approach we could not only confirm, but also extend the previously published results, both in terms of the accretor type (NS accretors possible) and in the range of potentially available mass transfer rates onto compact accretors in close binary systems.

Reference model scenario leads to a significant overestimate of the number of the potential EULX systems in the local Universe. We find close to [formula] systems with a NS, and a similar number of systems with a BH within the [formula] radius. Note that these numbers should be considered as upper limits. However, to date observations have revealed only one system with [formula], HLX-1 [\citep=Farrell11].

Observational data indicates that HLX-1 is a transient system with recurrent outbursts on timescales of about 1 year [\citep=Godet09]. Thermal-viscous instability mechanism was proposed to drive outburst in XRBs. However, this mechanism is not operational for mass transfer rates exceeding [formula] because the disk becomes too hot and thus constantly ionised [\citep=Lasota15]. If the periodicity observed in HLX-1 is connected to thermal-viscous instability, then the mass transfer rate needs to be lower than the above threshold, and high X-ray luminosity is achieved by effective beaming of radiation.

Since our reference model provides only a very crude estimate of X-ray luminosity, we proceeded with investigating the state-of-the-art global accretion models of the super-Eddington accretion regime. [\citetalias=Ohsuga07] performed 2-D radiation hydrodynamic simulations of supercritical accretion disks around BHs with the αP viscosity, while [\citetalias=Sadowski15] performed simulations of the magnetised accretion disks in general relativity using radiation MHD code KORAL. The former simulations were fed by inflowing stream of gas circularising near Rcir = 100RG, while the latter were initialised as equilibrium torii threaded by seed magnetic field. Both models agree that there is significant mass loss in the accretion flow, driven either by radiation pressure itself, or by radiation pressure and the centrifugal force. The work by [\citetalias=Ohsuga07] provides a dependence of the mass accretion rate and luminosity on the mass input rate (here [formula]). However, this result depends strongly on the assumed location of the circularization radius, i.e., it implicitly assumes that no gas is lost outside R  ≈  100RG. In real RLOF systems, the outer edge of the disk is expected to be located much farther (up to about 2 / 3 Roche lobe radius of the accretor). The other approach [\citepalias=Sadowski15] was not limited by the disk truncation inside the simulation box, but rather by the computational time, which allowed flow to reach the inflow/outflow equilibrium only to radius Req  ≈  100RG. Inside this region, the gas flows out as wind down to Rwind  ≈  20RG, and shows roughly constant mass loss rate [formula]. The total amount of gas lost in the system will therefore depend on the location of the outer disk edge, or rather the outer edge of the wind emitting region, through Eq. [\ref=eq:mdot_as]. Because of poor understanding of the dynamics in the outer region of accretion disks, we assumed Rwind  /  Rout  =  0.01.

Within all of the discussed here accretion models binary systems are able to breach the [formula] EULX limit. Although, in the case of [\citetalias=Sadowski15] the probability of forming a binary EULX is a few orders of magnitude smaller than for the other cases. Limitation of the mass accretion rate onto the BH in models developed in [\citetalias=Ohsuga07] and [\citetalias=Sadowski15] results not only in lower X-ray luminosity, but also in different orbit evolution as compared to our typical EULX case presented in Fig. [\ref=fig:bh]. Both effects (lower X-ray luminosity and different orbit evolution) decrease the predicted number of EULXs in the local Universe for [\citetalias=Ohsuga07] and [\citetalias=Sadowski15] models.

If disk winds are effective, matter which cannot be accreted is ejected from the system and takes away angular momentum. As a result the binary separation decreases and this prevents longer phases of high mass transfer. For the case of the [\citetalias=Ohsuga07] outflow model, the total time spent in the EULX regime is about [formula], as opposed to [formula] in our reference scenario. As a result, we estimated upper limit on the number of the potential BH EULXs drops in the [\citetalias=Ohsuga07] model from ~  100 to 37 within the [formula] radius. In Fig. [\ref=fig:bh] we show how the [formula] of our typical BH EULX (the reference model) translates into [formula] and [formula] derived from the model of [\citetalias=Ohsuga07].

When we limit the [formula] according to Eq. [\ref=eq:mdot_as] [\citepalias=Sadowski15], we find considerably fewer EULXs within the [formula] radius than in the case of our reference model (factor of [formula] fewer). For accretion limited case employing the model of [\citetalias=Ohsuga07] we obtain only a few times fewer number of EULXs (factor of ~  3 fewer). Particularly, in the case of our typical BH EULX system (Fig. [\ref=fig:bh]) we find 2 orders of magnitude smaller luminosity in the beam than in the reference model. In Fig. [\ref=fig:bh] we show the [formula] and a range of Lx computed for [formula] - [formula] [\citep=Sadowski15] corresponding to the mass transfer history [formula] of our typical BH EULX (the reference model).

Both [\citetalias=Ohsuga07] and [\citetalias=Sadowski15] considered accretion disks around BHs. The case of a NS accretion is far more complicated. A strong magnetic fields associated with NSs may disrupt the disk far away from the accretor. Even if the magnetic field is weak, the emission will be weaker as the accretor mass is lower. On the other hand, the NS accretion efficiency (η) is higher than that of BHs as the matter and photons do not fall under the event horizon. To date, no comprehensive simulations of such a case have not been performed. [\citet=Ohsuga07b] performed 2D simulations for a very limited range of initial parameters. They obtained supercritical accretion rates for NS accretors and provided information that the mass accretion rate is 20-30% of that on to the BH for the same mass-input rate. Thus, we have assumed NS Eddington limited accretion case in the Oshuga et al. models, but we have allowed super-Eddington accretion for Sdowski et al. models.

We note that had we impose the logarithmic scaling of  with [formula] [\citep=Poutanen07], we would have not obtained any systems with luminosities in the EULX regime. There exist factors that can improve this situation like beaming of the radiation, however, spherical nebulae observed around some of ULXs [\citep=Pakull02] [\citep=Russel11] [\citep=Moon11] may suggest dispersion of the outflow energy and nearly isotropic emission. The relation between [formula] and [formula] has not been derived from first principles, and advanced numerical models do not seem to confirm this relation [\citep=Ohsuga07] [\citep=Sadowski15].

[\citet=Gladstone13] and [\citet=Heida14] presented programs to search for the companion stars of the ULX systems in the optical and infrared bands, respectively. The former group investigated close ([formula]) ULXs and discovered [formula] optical counterparts among 33 ULXs. The masses of the companions have large uncertainties and generally only the upper limit is provided in the mass range 5.7-16.1. In a few cases the lower limit is also present in the mass range 8.3-14.7. These constrains are in agreement with our results. [\citet=Heida14] investigated 62 close ULXs and discovered 17 potential counterpart candidates. Based on the absolute magnitudes most of them (11) are Red Supergiants. According to our results the most common companions of the ULX systems able to reach the EULX regime are [formula] Hertzsprung gap stars with BH accretors and 1 - [formula] low mass Helium stars for NS accretors. However, it is possible that the Red Supergiants that we found to be in minority among the EULX companions, are more typical in the case of standard ULX systems. Detailed investigation of the properties of the entire ULX population will be presented in our forthcoming paper.

Conclusions

We conducted a proof-of-concept study to investigate if a binary system can form an ULX with the extreme mass transfer rate potentially able to lead to the X-ray luminosities in the [formula] range. This is at least hundred times more than what is expected for the Eddington limited stellar-origin [formula] BH [\citep=Belczynski10] [\citep=Belczynski14]. Observations of HLX-1 in ESO 243-49 with X-ray luminosity of [formula] encouraged us to look into the problem.

We find several evolutionary channels that lead to phases of a very high mass transfer rate in close RLOF binaries. These evolutionary phases can be extremely short, but it appears that many binaries experience such phases. The mass transfer rate may so high that (if Eddington limit, or any similar limit is breached) the X-ray luminosity may reach well above [formula]. We have adopted two physical accretion disk models in X-ray binaries, and we have shown that for each model (that takes into account mass loss from accretion flow and photon trapping) EULX sources are formed within typical stellar populations. We note that increasing the geometrical beaming of radiation, many more binaries than considered in our study could possibly become ULX or EULX.

It is found that about half of this potential extreme ULX systems host not BH, but NS accretors. This contradict the present consensus in the community, as the brightest ULX systems are commonly suspected to host IMBH primaries. Or at the minimum with stellar-origin BHs.
