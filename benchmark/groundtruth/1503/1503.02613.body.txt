Optimal design problems with fractional diffusions

Introduction

The goal of this paper is to establish existence and geometric properties of nonlocal optimal design problems. This class of problems arises in the study of best insulation devices. Motivations also come from semi-conductor theory, plasma physics, flame propagations etc. When taking into account eventual turbulence or long-range integrations, the model becomes more accurate when ruled by nonlocal operators, such as ( - Δ)α. In particular, the model becomes sensible to interior changes in the temperature; local versions of the problem can only feel changes on the boundary of the body to be insulated.

Let us recall that the fractional Laplacian ( - Δ)α is given by where [formula] is the Cauchy principal value and Cn,α is a normalization constant. The free boundary optimization problem we study here takes the following formulation: given a smooth domain [formula], a nonnegative function [formula], and a positive number ω > 0, minimize the α-energy

[formula]

among competing functions u within the functional set

[formula]

where Ln is the n-dimensional Lebesgue measure, and [formula] is the α-fractional Sobolev space (see, for example, [\cite=DnPV12]), i.e. the set of functions u for which

[formula]

By usual methods in the calculus of variations it is hard to perform volume preserving perturbations as to derive energy estimates. In turn, proving existence of a minimizer u as well as regularity properties of u and its free boundary [formula] is in general difficult tasks from the mathematical view point.

Local versions of the problem have been well studied in the literature, see [\cite=AAC86] [\cite=ACS88] [\cite=BMW06] [\cite=OT06] [\cite=T05] [\cite=T10] among others. A celebrate approach for tackling problems involving volume constrains is based on penalization techniques. The idea is to introduce an artificial parameter in the energy functional which charges for configurations that exceed the volume budget. For fixed values of the penalization parameter, the penalized functional can then be analyzed by free boundary variational methods. Nonlocal free boundary variational tools were first introduced in [\cite=CRS10]. Thus, the starting point of this current paper is to obtain regularity results for minimizers of nonlocal free boundary problems with fixed penalized parameter. This requires adjustments of existing free boundary methods from [\cite=CRS10]; some extra work is needed though. Of course all analytic and geometric estimates obtained depend upon the penalized parameter, and they blow-up as the penalization term goes to infinity.

The auxiliary penalization problem we consider here takes the following set-up. Fix an ε > 0, we define the ε-energy functional

[formula]

where

[formula]

Define the functional set

[formula]

and then, the penalized problem becomes

[formula]

As previously mentioned, the minimization problem [\eqref=1.4] is similar to the one treated in [\cite=CRS10]. However, there's no such thing as a free lunch - the key and in general hard issue, though, is to prove that the aimed volume is attained for small (but still positive) values of the penalization parameter. This is only possible by means of a refined control on the rate between volume decreasing versus energy increasing, of competing shapes. The appropriate tool for such a control is the so-called Hadamard's variational formula, whose local (smooth) version is known for over one-hundred years, [\cite=Had]. Hence, one of the main difficulties we handle in this work is to derive a measure-theoretic, α-fractional Hadamard's formula for domain variations. This is accomplished in section [\ref=sct_HF].

Another difficulty in dealing with nonlocal optimal design problems is the lack of local information on the unknowns. To bypass this inconvenience, we will make use of the extension property discovered in [\cite=CS07]. We consider the upper half-space

[formula]

and set β = 1 - 2α. For [formula] we solve the Dirichlet problem

[formula]

A solution to such a problem can be obtained by convolution with the Poisson kernel Pn,α(x,y) of the operator [formula] in [formula], see [\cite=CS07]. We have

[formula]

where qn,α is such that [formula]. From [\cite=CS07] we also know that

We have [formula].

Because of the divergence form of the elliptic operator in [\eqref=1.5], a Dirichlet integral is available. We also observe that if u solves [\eqref=1.5] and ∂yu  =  0 on the hyperplane {y = 0}, one can extend it evenly across {y = 0}, and the new equation satisfied by u is

[formula]

For any open subset Ω of [formula], we introduce the weighted Hilbert space

[formula]

where [formula]. We set

[formula]

The study of penalized problem [\eqref=1.4] is now replaced by the study of local minimizers of Iε, i.e. functions u that are in H1(β,B1) and satisfy

[formula]

The paper is organized as follows: in section [\ref=stc_P] we list few analytic and geometric properties we will need for the study of the (fixed) penalized functional [\eqref=I_esp]. Still in section [\ref=stc_P] we show that a minimum of Iε is α-Hölder continuous, which corresponds to the optimal regularity for the free boundary problem. We also show that it is non-degenerate. The constants though do depend on the penalized parameter ε and they blow-up as ε  →  0. In section [\ref=sct_FPS] we obtain measure estimates on the free boundary. In section [\ref=sct_HF] we derive a fractional Hadamard's variational formula and in section [\ref=sct_Rec] we prove that for ε  >  0 small enough - but still positive - the volume constraint is verified. This finally provides the existence of a minimum for the fractional optimization problem with volume constraint.

Preliminaries

We start off by listing few properties we will need along the article. Initially, let us set, for the sake of notations, that a minimizer of [\eqref=1.7] will be denoted by u instead of uε. Here and afterwards by Br(x,y) we denote the ball in [formula] centered at (x,y) and of radius r. When x = 0, we simply write Br. We will also write Bnr(x) for the ball in [formula] centered at x with radius r. We now prove existence of minimizers for the ε-penalized problem.

Given a smooth boundary datum, φ(x,y) defined on [formula], problem [\eqref=1.7] has an absolute minimum u.

Take u0 with Ln({u0 > 0})  ≤  ω, then Iε(u0)  ≤  C (uniformly in ε), also Iε  ≥    -  ω. Therefore, there exists a minimizing sequence [formula]. The sequence is bounded in Hα(B1) and, because Hα is continuously embedded into L2n / (n - 2α), the sequence [formula] converges (up to a subsequence) to a function u strongly in L2n / (n - 2α)  -  ε, for any ε > 0, and almost everywhere in [formula]. Thus,

[formula]

and

[formula]

Hence, u∈H1(β,B1) and since fε is a continuous and increasing function, one has

[formula]

Therefore u is an absolute minimizer of Iε in H1(β,B1).

For the behavior of a minimizer in its positivity set, we state the following proposition and refer the reader for its proof to Proposition 3.1 of [\cite=CRS10].

Let u be a local minimizer in [\eqref=1.7], and [formula] be such that u(x0,0) > 0. Then

[formula]

Moreover, if u is defined in [formula], is positive outside the hyperplane {y = 0} and satisfies [formula] in its positivity set, together with the estimate u(x,y) = O(|(x,y)|α), then ( - Δ)αu(  ·  ,0) = 0 in [formula].

We now turn our attention to optimal Hölder estimates for minimizers. In the proof of the following theorem we will use the characterization of Hölder functions, [\cite=M66]: given α∈(0,1), if B is a ball in [formula], and if there are C > 0 and p∈(1,n + 1) such that

[formula]

then u∈C0,α(B).

If u is a local minimizer of Iε posed in B1, then [formula].

For every r∈(0,1) and (x0,y0)∈B1, let us consider the harmonic replacement of u in Br(x0,y0) (we have chosen r < 1 - |x0|), i.e. the solution of

[formula]

From the translation invariance in x, we may assume x0 = 0. We will use the notation hr for the solution of [\eqref=2.2]. Note that u is an admissible Dirichlet datum (see Theorems 2.2 and 2.3 of [\cite=CRS10]). Note also, that for all r > 0 one has Iε(u,Br)  ≤  Iε(hr,Br). The latter implies

[formula]

Note that although the constant C depends on ε, but this does not bother us, because ε will always be fixed (maybe very small but fixed).

The rest of the proof is the same as of Theorem 1.1 in [\cite=CRS10]. We bring it here for reader's convenience.

Due to the identity [formula], we get from [\eqref=2.3]

[formula]

Therefore, if r < ρ < 1,

[formula]

Let now δ < 1 / 2. If ρ  =  δk, r = δk + 1, μ  =  δn, then [\eqref=2.4] gives

[formula]

which in turn, by choosing δ such that q = Cδ2(1 - α) < 1 and using induction, gives

[formula]

Therefore, for all r < 1 / 2

[formula]

Now, if [formula], then [formula], and

[formula]

which is [\eqref=2.1] with p = 1, and so u∈C0,α(B1 / 2).

In case of α > 1 / 2, we get from [\eqref=2.5]

[formula]

which is [\eqref=2.1] with p = 2.

Next we prove the non-degeneracy of a minimizer.

If u is a local minimizer of [\eqref=1.7], then there exists a constant C0 > 0 such that for all [formula],

[formula]

Assume that the conclusion of the theorem is not true. It means that for every C0 > 0 there is a point [formula] such that u(z,0) < C0(z,∂{u > 0})α. We denote by d the distance of the point (z,0) from the free boundary. We also define δ: = u(z,0). The contradictory assumption implies that δ can be made as small as we wish.

From the Harnack inequality, [\cite=FKS82], there exists c > 0 such that u  ≤  cδ in Bd(z,0). Now if γ is a smooth nonnegative function such that

[formula]

we define

[formula]

Note that v∈H1(β,Bd(z,0)), and v = u at the boundary of the ball, so it is an admissible test function for [\eqref=1.7]. Therefore

[formula]

On the other hand, from the definition of v one has

[formula]

and since v = 0 in Bd / 2(z,0), then

[formula]

which implies that

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

which contradicts [\eqref=2.6]. We remark that the constant C0 may depend on ε.

Now, arguing as in [\cite=CRS10], it is possible to show that u is in fact strongly non degenerate.

If u is a local minimizer of [\eqref=1.7] in B1, and (0,0) is a free boundary point, then there is C > 0 such that for r∈(0,1 / 2),

[formula]

As a consequence of the Hölder regularity result and the non-degeneracy, we get the positive density result below.

Let (0,0) be a free boundary point. If u is a local minimizer of [\eqref=1.7] in B1, then there is a constant C1 > 0 such that for every r > 0

[formula]

In fact, from the non-degeneracy we know that there is y∈Bnr such that u(y)  ≥  Crα > 0. By Hölder continuity, u > 0 in Bnδr(y) for a small δ > 0, which gives us the second estimate of [\eqref=2.7].

To prove the first estimate of [\eqref=2.7], it is enough to consider the case r = 1. Assume the contrary. There is a sequence of minimizers uk defined in B1, such that 0∈∂{uk > 0} and

[formula]

Recall that uk is uniformly Hölder continuous. We may assume that the sequence converges to u0 uniformly. Moreover, one has

[formula]

For every v agreeing with uk on ∂B1 one has Iε(uk,B1)  ≤  Iε(v,B1). Together with [\eqref=2.8] this implies for every v∈H1(β,B1) which agrees with u0 on ∂B1,

[formula]

Therefore, u0 minimizes the Dirichlet integral over the unit ball of [formula], and as such, satisfies [formula] in B1. Since u0(0) = 0 and [formula], then the strong maximum principle, see [\cite=B97], implies that [formula], which is a contradiction on the non-degeneracy property. Once again we remark, that the constant C1 may depend on ε.

Further properties of solutions

The ultimate goal of this section is to prove that the free boundaries of local minimizers of [\eqref=1.7] have local finite parameter. The results in this section are the analogue of the ones from [\cite=AC81].

For a local minimizer u in Ω, μ(u): =  - ( - Δ)αu is a nonnegative Radon measure with support in [formula].

Once again we recall the extension result from [\cite=CS07] (see also Theorem [\ref=t1.1] above). The proof is now the same as the one of Remark 4.2 of [\cite=AC81].

In the spirit of [\cite=AC81] a representation theorem can be proven. It plays an important role in the study of the free boundary.

If u is a local minimizer in Ω, then

[formula], for every compact set K  ⊂  Ω.

There exists a Borel fucntion qε such that

[formula]

that is for any ψ∈C∞0(Ω) there holds

[formula]

There exist constants 0 < c < C <   ∞   depending on n, Ω and ε such that for Br(x)  ⊂  Ω and x∈∂{u > 0} one has c  ≤  qε(x)  ≤  C and

[formula]

For Hn - 1 almost everywhere in ∂{u > 0} an outward normal ν  =  ν(x0) is defined and furthermore

[formula]

[formula], where ∂* is the reduced boundary.

The reduced free boundary [formula] is locally a C1,γ surface.

The first three assertions of the theorem follow as those of Theorem 4.5 of [\cite=AC81]. For the first assertion we also refer the reader to Theorem 1.1 of [\cite=SS12]. Note that [formula] has finite perimeter, thus, the reduced boundary is defined as well as the measure theoretic normal ν(x), for x∈∂*{u > 0} (see, for example [\cite=EG92]). The 5th assertion of the theorem is a consequence of the 3rd one and properties of minimizers proved above (see [\cite=EG92]). C1,γ regularity of the reduced free boundary follows by [\cite=SSS], see also [\cite=SR].

The proof of 4 is similar to the corresponding one in [\cite=DP05] (Theorem 5.5), but since in our case we are dealing with the fractional Laplacian, some modifications need to be done (similar to [\cite=CRS10]).

For a minimizer u we will denote by [formula] the set where it is 0, and by [formula] its positivity set. We will also use [formula] to denote the free boundary of u, and Γ*(u) - the reduced free boundary.

The reduced free boundary is the set of points x0 at which the following holds (see [\cite=G84]): given the half ball [formula], one has

[formula]

Note that from the uniform density of Ω± one has, as [formula] at the free boundary point x0

[formula]

Indeed, if u(x) = 0 for (x - x0)  ·  ν(x0)  ≥  δr, there is γ > 0 such that [formula], which implies

[formula]

a contradiction.

The same argument is valid, if x∈Ω-(u) is such that (x - x0)  ·  ν  ≤    -  δr.

In order to prove 4, we remark, that in fact it follows from the fact that blow-up limits at regular points are one-dimensional. To prove it, without loss of generality we assume that ν(x0) = en. Let

[formula]

be a blow-up of u, and let u0 be a blow-up limit. We need to prove that u0(x,0) = q(xn)α+, where q is a constant. There exists a coordinate system (x',xn) centered at 0 such that

[formula] (this is because of [\eqref=3.1]),

( - Δ)αu0 = 0 in Ω+(u).

Define v(x) = (xn)α+. By optimal regularity and non-degeneracy, there are positive constants C1, C2 such that 0 < C1v  ≤  u0  ≤  C2v. By applying the oscillation lemma (see [\cite=FKS82] or Theorem 2.5 of [\cite=CRS10]), one has that there exists λ∈(0,1) such that for all small enough r > 0,

[formula]

Since Harnack constants are invariant under the blow-up scaling, the oscillation lemma holds at every scale, the solutions being global. Thus, one may apply it all the way down from a ball of radius 2Nr (N being arbitrary large) to a ball of radius r. Therefore, [formula] is a constant. Of course, that constant depends on ε and also on the blow-up point. Although for our further work this fact is not very important, but by following the argument of [\cite=AC81], which proves 2nd assertion of the theorem, one can see that the constant is actually qε appearing in 2.

Next, we see that points, at which the free boundary has a tangent ball, are regular points.

We say that a free boundary point x0∈Γ(u) has a tangent ball from outside, if there is a ball B  ⊂  Ω-(u) such that [formula]. A point x0∈Γ(u) is said to be regular, if Γ(u) has a tangent hyperplane at x0.

The following result is from [\cite=CRS10]. The proof can also be concluded from the 4th assertion of the Theorem [\ref=t3.1] together with Theorem [\ref=t4.1] below.

(The free boundary condition). Let x0∈Γ(u) be a regular point. There exists a constant λε(α) such that

[formula]

A fractional Hadamard formula

In this section we proof a fractional Hadamard's variational formula, which will provide a rate control upon volume decreasing versus energy increasing, for competing shapes.

Let u be a local minimizer. We recall the notation Γ*(u) for its reduced free boundary. For given two points x1, x2∈Γ*(u), the idea is to make an inward perturbation around x1, and outward perturbation around x2 in such a way, that we do not change very much the original volume, and then compare the optimal configuration to the perturbated one in terms of the functional Iε. We proceed as follows.

Let [formula] be a nonnegative function from C∞  [0,1]0 with [formula]. For any [formula] and γ > 0, we define

[formula]

If v is any vector in [formula], direct computations show that in Br(xi,0)

[formula]

where 〈  ·  ,  ·  〉 the the inner product in [formula] and i takes the values 1 and 2. Note, that if γ is small enough, then Pr is a diffeomorphism that maps Br(xi,0) onto itself. Indeed, if [formula], then Pr is a local injective diffeomorphism. Now, if [formula], for t∈[0,1],

[formula]

for any (x,y)∈Br(xi,0). Finally, note that Pr = Id on ∂Br(xi,0), therefore Pr has to be onto.

For each r > 0 small enough, we consider the r-perturbed configuration by

[formula]

The idea is to compare our optimal configuration {u > 0} to its perturbation {vr > 0} in terms of the penalized problem [\eqref=1.7]. For any r > 0 small enough and i = 1,2, we consider the blow-up sequence [formula] given by

[formula]

From the blow-up analysis (see [\cite=DP05]) we know that the set [formula] approaches to {(x,0)∈B1,    〈(x,0)  ·  ν(xi,0)〉 < 0}, as [formula]. In order to compute the change on the volume of the perturbation, we use the Change of Variables Theorem to obtain

[formula]

as [formula]. Note that there is a constant C(ρ) such that for any unit vector [formula]

[formula]

A similar computation shows that

[formula]

as [formula]. From [\eqref=4.2], [\eqref=4.3] and [\eqref=4.4] we get

[formula]

as [formula]. From the Lipschitz continuity of the penalization fε, we obtain

[formula]

Now we should check what happens with the integral part of the functional. Initially we observe that

[formula]

once Γ*(uir) is smooth. Next we apply twice the Change of Variables Theorem and take into account that Pr maps Br(xi,0) diffeomorphically onto itself to write

[formula]

From [\eqref=4.1], using the fact that for any matrix A with |A| < 1,

[formula]

we have

[formula]

On the other hand,

[formula]

Combining [\eqref=4.6], [\eqref=4.7], [\eqref=4.8] and [\eqref=4.9], we obtain

[formula]

Now we recall that in the proof of 4 of Theorem [\ref=t3.1], we verified that uir(h,y) = qε(xi)(hn)α+ + o(r), as [formula], i.e. blow-up limits are one dimensional. Therefore, from the blow-up analysis, we have, as [formula]

[formula]

Hence, letting [formula] in [\eqref=4.10] leads to

[formula]

where

[formula]

is a positive constant. To check that indeed, 0 < c(ρ) <   ∞   is a positive constant, we argue as follows: since

[formula]

so the divergence theorem together with the blow-up analysis provides

[formula]

Recalling that the function ρ is compactly supported in

[formula]

0≤γα c(ρ)q(x)-q(x)+o(γ).

[formula]

q(x)=q(x).

[formula]

Recovering the original problem

Here we shall relate a solution to the penalized problem to a (possible) solution of our original problem. The idea is that the function fε will charge a lot for those configurations that have a volume bigger than ω. We hope that if the charge is too big optimal configuration of problem [\eqref=1.7] will prefer to have volume ω than pay for the penalization.

There exist C,c > 0 constants such that

[formula]

where uε is a solution to [\eqref=1.7].

Let Ω* be any smooth domain such that its complement contains Ωc with [formula]. From the minimality of uε we have

[formula]

where u* is the α-harmonic function in [formula] taking "boundary data" equal to φ in Ωc and 0 on ∂Ωc*. Thus

[formula]

This proves the estimate from above. In order to prove the estimate from below, we first note that since the weight |y|β is in the second Muckenhoupt class A2 for β∈( - 1,1), we have a Poincaré inequality (see, for example, [\cite=CRS10]), which together with [\eqref=5.1] provides

[formula]

for some C independent of ε. Recalling the fact that uε takes values φ outside of the domain, where it is α-harmonic, recalling also the mean value inequality and [\eqref=5.2], we obtain (by integrating along layers with [formula])

[formula]

the last integral being bounded uniformly in ε. Hence, the estimate from below is proved.

There exists C > 0 depending on the domain and φ, but independent of ε, such that λε(α)  ≤  C.

The proof of this lemma is a consequence of Proposition [\ref=p5.1], isoperimetric inequality and 2nd assertion of the Theorem [\ref=t3.1] (see the proof of the corresponding result in [\cite=AAC86], [\cite=BMW06], [\cite=DP05], or [\cite=T10]).

There exists c > 0 depending on the domain and φ but independent of ε such that c  ≤  λε(α).

As in the above mentioned references, the proof is based on the Hopf's Lemma, which is true also for the fractional Laplacian case (see [\cite=B97] or Proposition 2.7 in [\cite=CRS10]).

In fact, let z1∈Ω be such that uε(z1) > 0 for all ε > 0. Let δ: = dist(z1,∂Ω). We then consider the smooth family of domains [formula]. Let tε be the first t such that Γt touches ∂{uε > 0}. Let x0 be that touching point. Define ψε to be α-harmonic in [formula], with the following "boundary data":

[formula]

By the maximum principle we have uε  ≥  ψε in [formula]. From the (generalized) Hopf's Lemma we also know that there exists a constant c > 0 depending only on the domain and φ, but independent of ε, such that

[formula]

On the other hand we have the following asymptotic development around x0

[formula]

Letting x  →  x0 in [\eqref=5.4] and taking into account [\eqref=5.3], we obtain

[formula]

as desired.

Now we are ready to prove the main theorem of this section.

If ε is small enough, then any solution of [\eqref=1.7] is a solution of (1.1).

Basically, we just need to show that [formula], for ε small enough.

Suppose S > ω. In the spirit of the previous section, we consider an inward perturbation of the positivity set of uε with the volume change V, such that for the new function ũε we still have [formula]. Thus

[formula]

From Theorem [\ref=t4.1] and Lemma [\ref=l5.1] we have

[formula]

Using the fact that Iε(uε,Ω)  ≤  Iε(ũε,Ω), from [\eqref=5.5] and [\eqref=5.6] we get

[formula]

therefore (by dividing on V and letting [formula]) it provides us with

[formula]

which is a contradiction, when ε is small enough. Hence S  ≤  ω, for small ε. If S < ω, arguing the same way and using Lemma [\ref=l5.2], we obtain another lower bound for ε. Thus, when ε is small enough, S = ω.
