The Future of ADASS

Introduction

ADASS is the major annual conference for those interested in astronomy software and systems, from architects and developers to users and managers. Its 24 year history indicates its usefulness to individuals and institutions, as a place to showcase our latest work, to learn new techniques and discover which have been successfully used in our specialist field; to discuss emerging technologies with colleagues with similar interests and generally to work towards continually improving the overall shape of the field of astronomical software.

Success is no reason for complacency, however. Over the last two decades we have seen the needs of our community change, and indeed our demographic has itself changed. On the broader astronomical stage we're seeing our travel budgets shrinking, and many find themselves in the uncomfortable position of having to decide whether their single overseas conference for the year will focus on their science or on the technology aspects of their work If it is to continue being a useful and worthwhile conference, ADASS must adapt, keeping up with the needs of the ADASS community and the astronomical community as a whole, while keeping in mind our changing demographics.

To this end the ADASS Program Organising Committee (POC) ran a survey in early 2014 to ascertain the needs of the community and the direction and shape which future ADASS meetings should take. 140 people participated (as a comparison, a typical ADASS has around 270 attendees), 84% of whom had attended 2 or more ADASS conferences, 12% had attended 1 and 14% had never been to an ADASS.

Where do we go from here?

The discussion must continue. Please make your ideas and suggestions known. Speak with a member of the POC, or send your thoughts by email (). Alternatively tweet your suggestions to () or use Appgree to participate in ADASS polls.
