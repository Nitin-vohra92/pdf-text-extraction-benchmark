Tensor product of C-injective modules

introduction

Throughout this paper, R is a commutative Noetherian ring with non-zero identity. A classical question of Yoneda asks when the tensor product of two injective modules is injective. The first partial result related to this question was given by Hattori [\cite=H2]. He showed that the tensor product of two injective R-modules is injective when R is an integral domain. It is easy to see that the Hattori's result is also true when R is the product of a finite number of integral domains. Next, Ishikawa [\cite=I] showed that if R is a Noetherian ring such that the injective hull E(R) of R is a flat R-module, then the tensor product of any two injective R-modules is injective. It is well-known that if R is Gorenstein, then the injective hull of R is flat. More precisely, if R is Gorenstein, then E(R)  =  S- 1R, where S is the set of non-zero divisors of R. As a generalization, Cheatham and Enochs in [\cite=CE], considered a ring R, with the property that E(R) is flat, and showed that R has this property if and only if [formula] is Gorenstein for all [formula]. Finally, a complete answer to the question of Yoneda was given by Enochs and Jenda in [\cite=EJ2]. They proved that E(R) is flat if and only if the tensor product of any two injective R-modules is injective. Also, they showed that R is Gorenstein if and only if the torsion product of any two injective R-modules is injective.

Grothendieck [\cite=H1] introduced dualizing modules as tools for investigating cohomology theories in algebraic geometry. An R-module is called pointwise dualizing, if its localization at any maximal ideal of R is dualizing. Note that if   (R)  <    ∞  , then a pointwise dualizing module is dualizing. Over a Noetherian ring R, a finitely generated R-module C is semidualizing if the natural homothety map R  →    R(C,C) is an isomorphism and   iR(C,C) = 0 for all i > 0. Foxby [\cite=F], Vasconcelos [\cite=V] and Golod [\cite=G] independently initiated the study of semidualizing modules.

In this paper, we generalize the main results of [\cite=EJ2], and characterize dualizing modules in terms of the torsion product of C-injective modules (See Definition 2.4). Note that if C is dualizing, then [formula] is C-flat. Hence we consider those semidualizing R-modules C, whose injective hulls are C-flat. We prove that E(C) is C-flat if and only if the tensor product of any two C-injective R-modules is C-injective. Next we characterize dualizing modules as follows: C is pointwise dualizing if and only if the torsion product of any two C-injective R-modules is C-injective.

preliminaries

In this section, we recall some definitions and facts which are needed throughout this paper. By an injective cogenerator, we always mean an injective R-module E for which   R(M,E)  ≠  0 whenever M is a nonzero R-module. For an R-module M, the injective hull of M, is always denoted by E(M). Also, the flat cover of M is always denoted by F(M). For basic definitions and properties of envelope and covers, see the textbook [\cite=EJ1].

Let X be a class of R-modules and M an R-module. An X-resolution of M is a complex of R-modules in X of the form

[formula]

such that [formula] and n(X)  =  0 for all n  ≥  1. Also the X-projective dimension of M is the quantity

X-  R(M): =  inf { sup {n  ≥  0|Xn  ≠  0}|X is an X-resolution of M}

. So that in particular X-  R(0) =   -    ∞  . The modules of X-projective dimension zero are precisely the non-zero modules in X. The terms of X-coresolution and X-   are defined dually.

The following remark will be useful in the proof of our main theorems. For the proof, see [\cite=EJ2].

Let S be an R-algebra. Let M be an R-module and let N and L be S-modules. The Hom-evaluation homomorphism,

[formula]

given by [formula] where l∈L, ψ∈  R(N,M) and φ∈  S(L,N), is an isomorphism in either of the following conditions:

L is finitely generated and projective.

L is finitely generated, and M is injective.

Also the tensor-evaluation homomorphism,

[formula]

given by [formula] where l∈L, m∈M and ψ∈  S(L,N), is an isomorphism in either of the following conditions:

L is finitely generated and projective.

L is finitely generated, and M is flat.

A finitely generated R-module C is semidualizing if it satisfies the following conditions:

The natural homothety map R  →    R(C,C) is an isomorphism.

iR(C,C) = 0 for all i > 0.

For example a finitely generated projective R-module of rank 1 is semidualizing. If R is Cohen-Macaulay, then an R-module D is dualizing if it is semidualizing and that   R(D)  <    ∞   . For example the canonical module of a Cohen-Macaulay local ring, if exists, is dualizing.

Following [\cite=HJ], let C be a semidualizing R-module. We set FC(R)  =   the subcategory of R-modules [formula] where F is a flat R-module. IC(R)  =   the subcategory of R-modules   R(C,I) where I is an injective R-module. Modules in FC(R) (resp. IC(R)) are called C-flat (resp. C-injective). We use the notation C-   (resp. C-  ) instead of FC-   (resp. IC-   ). A complete FFC-resolution is a complex X of R-modules such that

X is exact and [formula] is exact for each I∈IC(R), and that

Xi∈FC(R) for all i  <  0 and Xi is flat for all i  ≥  0.

An R-module M is called GC-flat if there exists a complete FFC-resolution X such that [formula]. All flat R-modules and all R-modules in FC(R) are GC-flat.

A complete ICI-coresolution is a complex Y of R-modules such that

Y is exact and   R(I,Y) is exact for each I∈IC(R), and that

Yi∈IC(R) for all i  ≥  0 and Yi is injective for all i  <  0.

An R-module M is called GC-injective if there exists a complete ICI-coresolution Y such that [formula]. All injective R-modules and all R-modules in IC(R) are GC-injective. Note that when C  =  R these notions recover the concepts of Gorenstein flat module and Gorenstein injective modules, respectively.

In the rest of this section, we collect the basic properties of (semi)dualizing modules and related homological dimensions.

Let C be a semidualizing R-module. Then we have the following:

(C)  =    (R),   C  =    R and   (C)  =    (R).

If R is local, then C is indecomposable.

If x∈R is R-regular, then C / xC is a semidualizing R / xR-module .

R(C)  =    (R).

If R  →  S is a flat ring homomorphism, then [formula] is a semidualizing S-module.

Let M be an R-module. Then M  ≠  0 if and only if   R(C,M)  ≠  0 . Also M  ≠  0 if and only if [formula] .

The parts (i), (iii) and (v) follow from the definition of semidualizing modules. For (ii), note that if R is local, then R is indecomposable as an R-module. Now the isomorphism [formula] shows that C is indecomposable. For (iv), note that an element of R is R-regular if and only if it is C-regular since   (C)  =    (R). Now an easy induction yields the equality. For (vi), note that M  ≠  0 if and only if   R(  R(C,M))  =    R(M)  ≠  φ, and this is the case if and only if   R(C,M)  ≠  0. Finally if E is an injective cogenerator, then M  ≠  0 if and only if   R(M,E)  ≠  0 if and only if [formula], and this is the case if and only if [formula].

Let C be a semidualizing R-module, M an R-module and E be an injective R-module.

If M is a C-flat R-module, then   R(M,E) is a C-injective R-module. Also, if [formula] is local, M is Matlis refexive and [formula] is C-flat, then M is C-injective.

If M is a C-injective R-module, then   R(M,E) is a C-flat R-module .

Let R  →  S be a flat ring homomorphism. Then [formula]-[formula]-  R(M). Also the equality holds if S is a faithfully flat R-module .

For (i), use the Hom-tensor adjointness isomorphism. For (ii), use the Hom-evaluation isomorphism and the fact that   R(I,E) is flat whenever I is injective. For (iii), observe that if F (resp. E) is a flat (resp. an injective) R-module, then [formula] (resp. [formula]) is a flat (resp. an injective) S-module.

Let C be a semidualizing R-module, M an R-module and x∈R is R-regular.

If M is a C-flat R-module, then x is M-regular. Also M / xM is a C / xC-flat R / xR-module .

If M is a C-injective R-module, then   R(R / xR,M) is a C / xC-injective R / xR-module.

Is straightforward.

Let [formula] be a local ring and let C be a semidualizing R-module.

C is a dualizing R-module if and only if [formula] is a dualizing R̂-module .

Let [formula] be R-regular. Then C is a dualizing R-module if and only if C / xC is a dualizing R / xR-module.

Just use the definition of dualizing modules.

Let C be a semidualizing R-module and let M be an R-module.

C-[formula] and R(M) = C-R(R(C,M)).

C-R(M)  =  R(R(C,M)) and R(M) = C-[formula].

For (i), see [\cite=TW] and for (ii), see [\cite=STWY].

An R-module M is called a [formula]-injective R-module, if it is isomorphic to an R-module of the form [formula], where [formula] is a prime ideal of R.

It is well-known that over a Noetherian ring, any injective module is isomorphic to a direct sum of indecomposable injective modules. It follows that, if R is Noetherian, then any C-injective R-module M is isomorphic to a direct sum of [formula]-injective R-modules where [formula]. Note that, in this case, any direct sum of C-injective R-modules is again C-injective.

Let M be a finitely generated R-module. There are isomorphisms

[formula]

where the the first isomorphism holds because [formula], and the second isomorphism is tensor-evaluation. In particular, [formula] is an Artinian [formula]-module. Also, if we set [formula], then the isomorphism [formula] yields another isomorphism

[formula]

for all i  ≥  0.

main results

Throughout this section, C is a semidualizing R-module. We begin with two lemmas.

Let [formula] be a prime ideal of R and let M be a [formula]-injective R-module. Then [formula] if and only if [formula].

First assume that [formula]. Then [formula] and so by [\cite=EJ2], we have [formula]. Now using the Hom-evaluation isomorphism and Proposition 2.4(vi), one can see that [formula]. Conversely, if [formula] then another use of Hom-evaluation isomorphism and Proposition 2.5(vi), show that [formula]. Therefore in view of [\cite=EJ2], we obtain [formula], as wanted.

In [\cite=K], Kubik introduced the dual notion of semidualizing modules. Over a Noetherian local ring [formula], an Artinian R-module T is called a quasidualizing R-module, if the natural homothety map R̂  →    R(T,T) is an isomorphism and   iR(T,T) = 0 for all i > 0. She proved that a quasidualizing module is a cogenerator, that is, if   R(L,T)  =  0, for an R-module L, then L = 0. She then asked [\cite=K], does [formula] imply L = 0? Lemma 3.1 provides a counterexample. Let [formula] be complete local with   (R)  >  0. Then one checks easily that [formula] is quasidualizing. Now by lemma 3.1, we have [formula].

Let [formula] be a prime ideal of R and M be a [formula]-injective R-module. Then [formula] is a non-zero C-injective R-module if and only if [formula] is an injective [formula]-module.

First assume that [formula] is an injective [formula]-module. Then we have [formula] and hence [formula] is Artinian. Now lemma 3.1 shows that [formula]. Next we can write [formula] . But Proposition 2.5(v) shows that [formula] is semidualizing for [formula] and then by Proposition 2.5(ii) we must have [formula], that is, [formula]. By Remark 2.11, we have the [formula]-module isomorphisms

[formula],

and the later is a flat R-module. Therefor using the tensor-evaluation isomorphism, we have the following isomorphisms

[formula]

and the later module is C-injective. Conversely, assume that [formula] is a non-zero C-injective R-module. Then [formula] is a non-zero injective R-module by Theorem 2.9(i). On the other hand, by Remark 2.11, [formula] is an Artinian [formula]-module. Therefore [formula] is of finite length by [\cite=KLW]. Thus using the tensor-evaluation isomorphism, one can see that [formula] is a finite length injective [formula]-module and so

[formula]

is a finite length flat [formula]-module. It follows that [formula] and then [formula] is Artinian. Therefore, we can replace R by [formula] and assume that [formula] is an Artinian local ring. We want to show that C is an injective R-module. Set [formula]. Let n be a positive integer for which [formula] and [formula]. The freeness of [formula] implies that [formula]. Now if [formula] for each [formula], then [formula] which is impossible. Consequently, there exists an element [formula] for which [formula]. Hence θ is onto and so is split, from which we conclude that R is a direct summand of [formula]. Write [formula]. Taking Matlis dual, yields [formula], and the indecomposablity of C implies that [formula], whence K = 0 and [formula]. Hence C is injective, as wanted.

Now we are ready to prove one of our main results. The following theorem generalizes [\cite=CE].

The following are equivalent:

E(C) is C-flat.

C-R(E(C))  <    ∞  .

[formula] is an injective [formula]-module for all [formula].

E(M) is C-flat for all C-flat R-modules M.

E(M) is C-flat for all GC-flat R-modules M.

F(M) is C-injective for all C-injective R-modules M.

F(M) is C-injective for all GC-injective R-modules M.

[formula] is C-injective for all C-injective R-modules N and [formula].

S- 1C is an injective R-module, where S = R(C).

(i)[formula](ii). Is evident.  (ii)[formula](iii). We can write [formula]. Now, in view of Theorem 2.9(ii), we have   R(  R(C,E(C))  <    ∞  , and thus

[formula]

for all [formula]. Hence [formula], and so we have [formula] by [\cite=EJ1]. Therefore [formula] is an injective [formula]-module for all [formula].

(i)[formula](viii). Let N and [formula] be C-injective R-modules. Let [formula] and [formula] be two distinct prime ideals of R. Then either [formula] or [formula] . Suppose that [formula]. Set [formula] and [formula]. Then we have

[formula]

since [formula]. Next we prove that if [formula], then

[formula].

Note that the Hom-evaluation isomorphism in conjunction with Proposition 2.5(vi), imply that this module is zero if and only if [formula] is zero. Therefore in view of Proposition 2.5(i), we need only to prove that if [formula], then [formula]. We claim that if [formula], then there exists an element [formula] which is R-regular. For otherwise, the prime avoidance theorem implies that [formula] for some [formula]. But as we have seen in (ii)[formula](iii), in this case [formula] is an Artinian ring and then [formula], which is impossible. Next observe that the exact sequence [formula] implies an epimorphism [formula], which is locally nilpotent. Now it is easy to see that [formula]. Therefore in order to prove that [formula] is C-injective, it is enough to prove that [formula] is C-injective for all [formula]. The assumption together with Theorem 2.9(ii), show that [formula] is flat for all [formula]. Hence [formula] is injective and thus using the tensor-evaluation isomorphism, we see that

[formula]

is C-injective. Finally, Since any direct sum of C-injective R-modules is C-injective, we conclude that [formula] is C-injective.

(iv)[formula](vi). Suppose that I is an injective R-module, and θ:F  →    R(C,I) is flat cover. Assume that F' is a flat R-module. Consider the composition

[formula],

in which [formula] and [formula] is the tensor-evaluation isomorphism. This isomorphism is such that [formula] for all α∈  R(F',F). Now it is easy to check that [formula] is FC-cover of I. But since I is injective, there exists a homomorphism [formula] making the following diagram commute. On the other hand, [formula] is C-flat by assumption. Hence, by definition of cover, there exists a homomorphism [formula] whose restriction to [formula] is an automorphism, and making the following diagram commute: Therefore, [formula] is a direct summand of [formula] and so is injective. Thus, by Theorem 2.9(i), [formula] is C-injective, as wanted.

(vi)[formula](vii). Let M be a GC-injective R-module. Then, by definition, M is a homomorphic image of a C-injective R-module, say L. But F(L) is C-injective by assumption. Now by definition of flat cover, F(M) is a direct summand of F(L), and hence is C-injective.

(vii)[formula](v). Let M be a GC-flat R-module and let E be an injective cogenerator. Let [formula] denote the trivial extension of R by C and view M as an [formula]-module via the natural surjection [formula]. Now M is G-flat over [formula] by [\cite=HJ]. This is the case if and only if   R(M,E) is G-injective over [formula]. Another use of [\cite=HJ] shows that   R(M,E) is GC-injective. Hence, by assumption, F  =  F(  R(M,E)) is C-injective. Set [formula] and F  =    R(C,I), where I is injective. Then we have

[formula],

in which the isomorphism is Hom-evaluation. Finally, since [formula] is injective, E(M) must be a direct summand of [formula], and hence must be C-flat.

(viii)[formula](iii). Let [formula]. Then [formula] and hence [formula] is a non-zero C-injective R-module by lemma 3.1 and the assumption. Thus [formula] is an injective [formula]-module by lemma 3.2 .

(iii)[formula](ix). Note that [formula], and that [formula] is Artinian for all [formula]. It, therefore, follows that   S- 1R(  iS- 1R(T,S- 1C))  =  φ for all i  ≥  1 and all finitely generated S- 1R-modules T, since [formula] is an injective [formula]-module. Thus S- 1C is an injective S- 1R-module, and so is an injective R-module.

(ix)[formula](iv). Let [formula] be a C-flat R-module. As F is a flat R-module, we can write [formula], where Fi is a finitely generated free R-module. Observe that E(C)  =  S- 1C, because [formula] is essential and that S- 1C is an injective R-module by assumption. Now it is easy to see that [formula].

(iv)[formula](v). Let M be a GC-flat R-module. By definition, M can be embedded in a C-flat R-module, N say. Now E(M) is a direct summand of E(N), and hence is C-flat since E(N) is C-flat by assumption.

(v)[formula](i). Is trivial, since C itself is a GC-flat R-module.

Let M be a GC-flat R-module. As we have seen in Theorem 3.3, if E(C) is C-flat then E(M) is C-flat. Set [formula], where F is a flat R-module. Then [formula]. On the other and, by the definition, M is a submodule of a C-flat R-module which implies that   R(M)  ⊆    R(C). But Theorem 3.3 implies that [formula] for any prime ideal [formula]. Hence we have

[formula]

Note that, in this case, [formula] is Artinian and hence [formula] is completion of a free [formula]-module. Therefore [formula], where [formula] is the completion of a free [formula]-module.

Assume that [formula] is a Noetherian local ring. Then we have the following statements:

[formula] for all i  ≥  0.

Suppose that [formula] is R- and iR(R(C,E(k)),C)-regular for 1  ≤  i  ≤  n. Set [formula]. Then for each i with 1  ≤  i  ≤  n - 1, there is an isomorphism [formula] .

(i) If 0  →  E0(C)  →  E1(C)  →  ... is the minimal injective resolution of C, then [formula] is an injective resolution of [formula] as an R-module and R̂-module . Note that for each prime ideal [formula] of R, the injective R-module [formula], is a direct sum of copies of [formula]. On the other hand, one can use the Hom-evaluation isomorphism to see that if [formula], then

[formula]

Moreover, if [formula] is a prime ideal of R̂, with [formula], then

[formula]

Finally, by using the isomorphisms [formula], and [formula], we have the desired isomorphism.

(ii) Set [formula]. Note that x is C-regular too. Let 0  →  E0(C)  →  E1(C)  →  ... be the minimal injective resolution of C. By applying the functor   R(  R(C,E(k)), - ), we can compute   iR(  R(C,E(k)),C). But since [formula] for any prime [formula], one can use Hom-evaluation isomorphism to see that

[formula]

Hence if we set [formula], then   iR(  R(C,E(k)),C) is just the i-th cohomology of the complex

[formula]      (*)

Observe that μ0  =  0 because [formula]. Note that by [\cite=EJ1], the complex

[formula] (**)

is the minimal injective resolution of [formula] as an [formula]-module. Thus application of the functor [formula] on the above complex, yields [formula] for all i  ≥  0. But then using the Hom-evaluation isomorphism, and the fact that [formula], we have the following isomorphisms

[formula]

Let Bi , [formula] be the images and kernels of the boundary maps of the complex ( * ), respectively. Observe that x is not a zero-divisor on [formula] since [formula] and x is [formula]-regular. Also the exact sequence

[formula],

in cojunction with the assumption, show that x is [formula]-regular too. So that, we have two exact sequences

[formula] ,

[formula].

Consequently, [formula] and [formula] can be identified with images and kernels of the complex ( *  * ). Therefore we have the isomorphism

[formula]

for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  n - 1, as wanted.

The following theorem is a generalization of [\cite=EJ2].

The following are equivalent:

C is pointwise dualizing.

for any [formula], and any [formula]-injective R-module M, [formula] and   Ri(M,M)  =  0 for all [formula].

For all C-injective R-modules N and [formula], and all i  ≥  0, [formula] is C-injective.

(i)[formula](ii). Let [formula], and [formula]. In view of Remark 2.11, there is a natural [formula]-isomorphism [formula] for each i  ≥  0. Therefore, in order to establish the desired isomorphism, it is enough for us to show that, if [formula] is a d-dimensional local ring and M  =    R(C,E(k)), then [formula] and   Ri(M,M)  =  0 for all i  ≠  d . Set [formula]. Then we have the isomorphisms

[formula]

Observe that [formula] for all i  ≠  d, since C is dualizing. Note also that [formula] is dualizing for R̂ by Proposition 2.8(i). Now using lemma 3.5(i), we have

[formula],

for all i  ≠  d, and that

[formula]

where the third and the fourth isomorphisms hold because both M and E(k) are Artinian and that [formula] for all i  ≥  0. It follows that   Ri(M,M)  =  0 for all i  ≠  d, and [formula].

(ii)[formula](iii). Any C-injective R-module M, is a direct sum of [formula]-injective R-modules, where [formula] runs over   R(M). Now just note that if [formula] are two distinct prime ideals of R, then in view of Remark 2.11, we have [formula] for all i  ≥  0, and that any direct sum of C-injective R-modules is C-injective.

(iii)[formula](i). Since, by Remark 2.11, the isomorphism [formula] holds for all [formula]-injective R-modules M, all i  ≥  0 and all [formula], we can replace R by [formula] and assume that [formula] is local. Thus by assumption and the new notation, the R-module   Ri(  R(C,E(k)),  R(C,E(k))) is C-injective for all i  ≥  0. Therefore by Proposition 2.6(ii), the R-module

[formula]

is C-flat. Hence in view of lemma 3.5(i) and Proposition 2.8(i), we can replace R by R̂ and assume that R is a complete local ring. Assume that   (R)  =  d, and that [formula] is a maximal R-sequence in [formula]. Then by Proposition 2.7(i) and Lemma 3.5(ii), we see that

[formula],

is a [formula]-flat [formula]-module. Therefore in view of Proposition 2.8(ii), we can replace R by [formula] and C by [formula], and assume that   (R)  =  0. In this case, Lemma 3.1 yields

[formula],

and the Matlis dual of the later R-module is   R(  R(C,E(k)),C), which is C-flat. Hence it is C-injective by 2.6(i), and so C is dualizing by Lemma 3.2.

Remark. After preparing this paper and while we wanted to submit it to "arxiv", we observed the paper: a criterion for dualizing modules [\cite=DNT], which it's main result is similar to the above theorem, but our proof is different.

The following corollary is an application of the above theorem in local cohomology. For an R-module M, the i-th local cohomology module of M with respect to an ideal [formula] of R, denoted by [formula], is defined to be

[formula].

For the basic properties of local cohomology modules, please see the textbook [\cite=BS].

Let [formula] be a d-dimensional Cohen-Macaulay local ring. Then

[formula]

Note that R̂ is a d-dimensional complete Cohen-Macaulay ring, and hence admits a canonical module ωR̂. The R-module [formula] is Artinian by [\cite=BS]. Hence [formula] is Artinian for all i  ≥  0 by [\cite=KLW1]. Hence there are isomorphisms

[formula]

in which the second isomorphism is from [\cite=EJ1], and the last one is the flat base change [\cite=BS]. On the other hand, there are isomorphisms

[formula]

in which the first isomorphism holds because [formula] is Artinian, the second isomorphism is the flat base change, and the last one is the local duality [\cite=BS]. Hence [formula] is ωR̂-injective R̂-module and then by Theorem 3.5, we have

[formula]

Therefore, in view of [\cite=BS], we have

[formula]
