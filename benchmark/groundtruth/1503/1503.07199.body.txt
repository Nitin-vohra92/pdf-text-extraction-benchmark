Revisiting Interval Graphs for Network Science

Introduction

The vertices of an interval graph represent intervals over a real line where overlapping intervals denote that their corresponding vertices are adjacent. This implies that the vertices are measurable by a metric and there exists a linear structure in the system. For example interval graphs was introduced to deduce the linearity of genes when Benzer noticed that the behavior of mutated strains of bacteriophage T4 (virus) forms an interval graph [\cite=benzer1959topology].

The generalization of interval graphs is where the vertices are d-dimensional axis-parallel hyper-boxes such that intersecting boxes implies that their corresponding vertices are adjacent in the graph G. This can be expressed as a finite set of d interval graphs on the same vertex set, i.e [formula] such that [formula] where the interval graph Ik(V,Ek) is the projection of the boxes onto the kth axis.

This can be visualized by taking the species in an ecology as boxes and each of the axes measures a different environmental factor like temperature, soil acidity, amount of sunlight, etc. Each species are enclosed in their unique environment phase space where they are adaptable, and the boxes that intersect implies that the species can coexist in a common environment.

Thus interval graphs are used to model the stability and complexity of ecology system by studying the number of factors (dimensions) the species in the ecology depend on [\cite=opac-b1129706] [\cite=eklof2013dimensionality] [\cite=jordan2004network]. Applications of interval graphs also arise naturally in many time dependence problems like task scheduling [\cite=carlisle1995k] [\cite=kolen2007interval] or other linear structures like pavement deterioration analysis [\cite=gattass1981] and Bioinformatics [\cite=jungck1982computer] [\cite=biedl2004finding].

After 20 years of research, interval graph went out of fashion in the 1980s and was not revisited when Network Science recently expressed interests on multi-relational networks like multiplex [\cite=Kivela2013] [\cite=boccaletti2014structure]. Multiplexes and interval graphs belong to the same mathematical object known as graphs on the same vertex set, where a multiplex is a collection of graphs [formula] with each graph representing the different relationships of a system.

For example in a social multiplex, people are connected by specific relationship categories like friends, colleagues or family. Other examples include the different modes of transportations in a transport system and the different ways researchers are connected in citation networks [\cite=Kivela2013]. It is the modern outlook of Network Science to preserve the rich relational data of the system.

Specifically interval graphs and multiplexes are special types of a more general mathematical object known as intersection graph [\cite=terry1999topics], where a vertex pair is connected if they have overlapping attributes. E.g. in a social multiplex, two individuals are connect as schoolmates (relationship) if they are in the same school together (attribute).

The motivation of this paper is to show that the tools/perspectives from Network Science can benefit interval graphs research, vice versa.

Preliminaries

Interval Graphs

An interval graph I(V,E) maps a set of intervals [formula] as vertices such that adjacent vertices (a,b) denotes [formula] [\cite=fishburn1985interval] (Fig. [\ref=fig:interval_graph]).

The sequential nature of the intervals implies that there is a linear ordering [formula] on the vertices where for all vertex triples v1,v2,v3∈V with [formula] and [formula], if (v1,v3)∈E then by transitivity (v1,v2),(v2,v3)∈E. This colloquially states that there is no "shortcut" in the graph, i.e. there is no independent vertex triples where every two of them are connected by a path avoiding all neighbors of the third. This property is known as asteroid-triple free (AT-free).

An interval graph is chordal and AT-free [\cite=Lekkeikerker1962].

The lack of "shortcut" in AT-free graphs restricts the number of paths among the vertices in the graph and hence limits the search space for a variety of problems. Thus the AT-free property presents useful algorithmic structure on interval graphs such that some NP-complete graph problems are tractable in polynomial time [\cite=chandran2010geometric].

Interval Graphs As Hyper-Boxes

The graph from the intersection of interval graphs Ii(V,Ei), i.e. [formula] forms a set of axis-parallel hyper-boxes as vertices in m dimensions, and the adjacent vertices implies that their corresponding hyper-boxes intersects. The minimum m interval graphs to represent G is its boxicity and it is a measure of complexity (Fig. [\ref=fig:interval]) [\cite=opac-b1129706] [\cite=stouffer2006robust].

For instance the food webs in ecology is a competition graph, where two species (vertices) are connected if they compete over the same food source. Although ecology is generally known to be a complex system, Cohen showed that food webs are generally low dimensional and simple. In fact many food webs are interval graphs where the ordering of the intervals (as predators) correlates to the size of their preys [\cite=opac-b1129706].

A marine food web is an example of a food web that is not an interval graph as a predator feeds on species based on two environment niches -- the size of the prey and the depth of the water. Since each of the niches can be expressed as an interval graph, two predators are in competition if they feed on the same preys, i.e. their 2-dimensional boxes intersect.

However it is computationally hard (NP-complete) to determine the boxicity of an arbitrary graph as there are more degrees of freedom to embed a graph in d-dimensional space. Fortunately one can still make approximations by the analytical bounds on the degree of the graph. Suppose Δ and δ are the maximum and minimum degree of a n-vertices graph respectively, the boxicity of the graph is bounded between n / (2(n - δ - 1)) [\cite=adiga2008lower] and min(n / 2,Δ2 + 2,⌈(Δ + 2) ln n⌉) [\cite=sunil2008boxicity].

The boxes are synonymous to embedding its graph in m dimensional Minkowski r-metric space Mrm such that for all adjacent u,v∈V, their distance in the metric space is bounded by some length [\cite=Freeman83]:

[formula]

where lu and lu are length given for their respective vertices, and [formula] is a vector mapping u to the metric space with the real-value functions [formula]. In addition the functions fi on all u,v∈V is conditioned by Minkowski r-metric space:

[formula]

The arbitrary constant r is a weighting parameter where all components |fi(u)  -  fi(v)| are equally weighted for r = 1 (i.e. Manhattan Distance). For r = 2 (i.e. Euclidean Distance), the components that are greater contribute more to the Minkowski Distance. Hence by letting r =   ∞   to complete the metric space, the greatest component will dominate the distance where duv  =   max mi = 1|fi(u) - fi(v)|, and each point is a hyper-box with sides parallel to the axes.

Topology of an Unknown Structure (Example)

Benzer deduced the linearity of genes by rejecting the hypothesis that it is from a non-linear structure with interval graphs. Suppose there are two hypotheses of a gene's structure -- linear and branched (Fig. [\ref=fig:gene]).

The vertices are the different mutated variants of the T4 virus such that they do not have the complete genome to kill bacterias independently. In this case vertex A refers to the variant where segment A of T4 is changed. If viruses with overlapping segments do not have the entire information to kill the bacterias, then an edge is placed between them. Since the graph on the left is constructed from a linear structure, it is an interval graph.

However if T4 genes was a branched structure, then the resultant graph will not be an interval graph. In the same figure, vertices 3, 5 and 6 form an asteroid-triple -- the path 3-1-6 (3-4-5 and 5-2-6) avoids the neighbors of vertex 5 (respectively 6 and 3). It is noteworthy to observe that by removing any of the vertices 1, 2 or 4, the graph will be an interval graph. It is also possible to get an interval graph by removing edges {1,3} and {1,4} from the original graph. Thus interval graphs only supports the hypothesis of a linear structure, but it is insufficient to prove the linearity of a system.

Multiplex

A multiplex is a finite set of networks, [formula], where every graph Gi(V,Ei) has a distinct edge set Ei  ⊆  V  ×  V.

Multiplex is a natural transition from network as a model to preserve the rich relational properties in the data. Each of the networks refers to a distinct relationship in the complex system, e.g. a transportation complex system has different modes of transport and each type can be represented by one of the networks in the multiplex.

However the relationships in many multiplexes are not well defined by physical infrastructures like the transportation complex systems. For instance the relationships in a social multiplex like colleagues, family, friends, etc are chosen based on the researchers' opinions or by the limitation of their data. Thus a system can be easily expressed as two distinct multiplexes and dynamics. As a result the reliability from the conclusions of such multiplexes can be unstable.

Therefore one of the goal of this paper is to introduce interval graphs as a way to study the granularity of such relationships. If we assume that a linear structure like an interval graph is the simplest relational behavior of a complex system, then by using the concept of boxicity, the guideline is that the number of relationships of a multiplex should not be more than the boxicity of the multiplex's projection (details in the next section).

Structural Connection Between Interval Graphs and Multiplexes

The Union of a Multiplex

The projection of a multiplex [formula] is the graph from the union of all the edge sets, i.e. [formula].

Before the popularization of multiplex research, many scientists tend to simplify their multi-variate data by projection. For example the Zachary Karate Club Network is the projection of 8 networks (relationships) on the same vertex set [\cite=zachary1977ifm]. It is the most general way to describe the connectivity of a system.

In the previous section we suggested that the number of relationships in a multiplex should not exceed the boxicity of its projection. Given that it is possible to express the same (projected) network with a simpler model like low dimensional hyperboxes, a multiplex with a higher number of relationships will appear unnecessarily complex. Thus unless there are justifications for a high number of relationships, deviating this guideline is synonymous to going against the grain of Occam's Razor Principle.

Another argument for this guideline is to assume that any dynamics of a system are measurable by some metric. For example the acquaintanceship of a school alumni social network can be "measured" by the time when the members attended the school. Friends within the alumni are often schoolmates at around the same period.

However some dynamics are more complex and require more than one metric to measure them, for instance the dynamics of prey-and-predator in a marine ecology (section [\ref=sec:hyperbox]). Thus we posit that if every dynamics is measurable by at least one (linear) metric, then the number of metrics is the upper bound to the number of dynamics. Hence a multiplex with significantly more relationships than the boxicity of its projection suggests that some of the relationships are driven by the same dynamics and it maybe more appropriate to combine these relationships.

The above arguments are not rigorous and hence we emphasize that it should be taken as a guideline. However the challenge to this approach is that to determine the boxicity of an arbitrary network is a NP-complete problem and could be the same reason to why boxicity is not common in Complexity Science. The degree distribution and clustering coefficient of the union of networks ensembles can be found in [\cite=loe13].

The Intersection of a Multiplex

The intersection of a multiplex [formula] is the graph from the intersection of all the edge sets, i.e. [formula].

The projection of a multiplex appears to be the counter-thesis of modern Network Science by reducing the problem back to a network. However in order to understand the connection between multiplexes and networks, it is important to study the process from both sides. Hence without compromising too much relational information for simplicity, the analysis of the overlapping edges from the projection is pivotal, i.e. the graph [formula].

Statistical Structural Properties

The distribution of the overlapping edges is an essential characteristic to distinguish multiplex ensembles from random [\cite=Bianconi13] [\cite=chen2012degree] [\cite=Lee12] [\cite=RanolaASSL10]. For example a multiplex ensemble is defined to be correlated if the expected number of overlapping edges deviates from the behavior of a collection of random Erds-Rényi graphs [\cite=Bianconi13]. The degree of correlation in turn affects the phase transition of the emergence of a giant component [\cite=Lee12].

However besides the trivial case on the intersection of Erds-Rényi networks [\cite=loe13], we have little understanding on the statistical properties like degree distribution or clustering coefficient of the intersection of the different network ensembles. In this paper, we will present the intersection of two combinations -- Erds-Rényi network with Barabási-Albert network, and Watts-Strogatz network with Barabási-Albert network.

Erds-Rényi network with Barabási-Albert: Barabási-Albert graph Bn,m on n vertices is an error-free model to simulate the preferential attachment phenomenon in real world network, where m new edges are added at each iteration [\cite=barabasia99]. Therefore to make it more relevant to real-world problems, this has lead to Barabási-Albert variants with experimental noise [\cite=dorogovtsev2000structure] [\cite=Pennock02winnersdont] in which preferential and random uniform (noise) attachment are combined. Similarly in the projection of a multiplex with Erds-Rényi and Barabási-Albert graph, the former adds the uniform attachment noise to the scale-free system [\cite=loe13].

Let p be the probability that a pair of vertices are connected in the Erds-Rényi network. When the Erds-Rényi network intersects a Barabási-Albert network, only a fraction (i.e. p) of the edges that is incident to vertex v are in the edge set of both networks. Hence if v has degree k, then after the intersection its resultant degree is ≈  kp.

Define Pr and Pb to be the degree distribution of the resultant network and Barabási-Albert respectively. Suppose we want to find Pr(deg  =  x), we can group all the vertices in Barabási-Albert that are most likely to have degree x after the intersection, i.e. ⌊kp⌋  =  x. Thus:

[formula]

or

[formula]

where Pb(deg  =  k)  ~  k- 3 is scale-free.

Note that Pb(deg  =  ⌈x / p⌉  +  i)  ~  ⌈x / p⌉- 3 as x / p dominates all values of i. Hence Pr(deg  =  x)  ≈  ⌊1 / p⌋  ·  ⌈x / p⌉- 3, implying that the subgraph is also scale-free. However this does not contradict the conclusion of [\cite=Stumpf05] where "the subgraphs of scale-free networks are not scale-free". What Stumpf had done was to derive a subgraph by removing vertices of a scale-free network whereas in our case it is only the edges of a scale-free network that are removed.

Watts-Strogatz network with Barabási-Albert network: A real-world characteristic that Barabási-Albert ensemble fails to model is the likelihood that vertices tend to cluster together in graphs, i.e. high clustering coefficient. This characteristic can be modeled with a Watts-Strogatz Wn,w,q on n vertices where w is the degree of a ring lattice for the initial construction, and q is the rewiring probability.

The union of these networks exhibit real-world statistical properties like power-law-like degree distribution and high clustering coefficient [\cite=loe13]. However this time we are not able to analytically determine the properties of the intersection, although simulations suggests a power-law-like degree distribution (Fig. [\ref=fig:WSnBA]). Since the clustering coefficient of a subgraph is less than the graph itself, we can deduce that the intersection has low clustering coefficient given that the clustering coefficient of Barabási-Albert network is low.

Interval graphs as Substructure of Multiplex

Since each graph in a multiplex is the intersection of interval graphs, i.e. [formula], thus the set of overlapping edges is also the hyper-box representation of the system. Specifically the set of overlapping edges form the graph [formula].

Using the same idea as the previous section, we can interpret the boxicity of H as the number of metrics to describe the phenomenon when information follows through all the relationships in the multiplex simultaneously. If H is an interval graph, then there is a linear way for information to follow such that the conditions for all the relationships are met.

For example we have a social multiplex with two types of relationships -- work and friends. Suppose there is a rumor regarding a company-wide action like retrenchment and there are discussions (information flow) regarding the situation. Due to the sensitivity/relevance of the issue, the discussions between colleagues are more likely to be also close friends, i.e. the rumor that spread between two people have to be connected in both relationships. Thus the boxicity of H indicates the complexity of such information flow (details in section [\ref=sec:interval-propagation]).

Information Propagation of Interval Graphs

Information propagation is the behavior in which a property on the vertices is spread across the graph. In the infection model, a vertex passes the property to its neighbors probabilistically at each iteration. This models the behavior of a virus epidemic where there is a probability for an entity to catch the virus from its neighbor [\cite=bailey1975mathematical] [\cite=hethcote2000mathematics].

Alternatively a vertex adopts the property under the influence of its neighbors when the ratio of its neighbors with the property exceeds a threshold. This is the influence model and it is used to describe the nature of social trends like product recommendations [\cite=bikhchandani1992theory] [\cite=goldenberg2001talk] [\cite=granovetter1978threshold]. In general terms, vertices with the information (e.g. infection) are named as active vertices, and if otherwise they are known as inactive vertices.

There is a common notion with these models that information propagate along the edges of the network. However it is not possible in general to consider all the relationships in the system to map the full topology of the network. Thus there is a situation where information flow between non-adjacent vertices. This discontinuous flow of information is often assumed to be the actions of some confounding variables in the system and is often simulated by passing the information probabilistically to a random non-adjacent vertex [\cite=myers2012information] [\cite=gomez2010inferring].

This paper proposes the hyper-boxes representation of a graph as a deterministic linear framework to model the discontinuous flow of information.

Linear Fine Structures

Overview

The linear fine structures of a graph G is the set of m interval graphs [formula] as hyper-boxes where [formula]. The set of edges from the intervals graphs that are not in G, i.e. [formula], are the confounding edges unobserved from the graph G. Thus when information propagate through the edges in Ec, it will appear from the perspective of G that there is a discontinuous flow of information.

In Fig. [\ref=fig:interval], the box representation of the graph on vertices [formula] has boxicity 2. The box (graph) is the intersection of the bottom and left intervals, where box A is enclosed by intervals A' and A''. Suppose interval A' (vertex A) is active and infects adjacent interval F'. Although A' and F' are adjacent, their respective boxes (vertex) are not adjacent, i.e. A is not adjacent to F. Hence from the perspective of the graph, there is a discontinuous flow of infection between non-adjacent vertices.

For example in a marine food web, a predator feeds on species based on two environment niches -- the size of the prey and the depth of the ocean where the predator hunts. Since each of the niches can be expressed as an interval graph, and two predators are in competition if they feed on the same preys, i.e. their hyper-boxes overlaps.

Hypothetically suppose there is an increase of toxin deposits in the ocean and since the toxin builds up in the food chain (bioaccumulation), the toxin level of a fish is proportional to its size. Therefore the spread of the toxin in the ecology will appear discontinuous since the feeding patterns of the deep ocean marine is different from the species near the surface.

This framework does not obscure the context of the propagation's dynamics with random process, i.e. the flow of the information is well defined either by the flow through E or Ec. However the trade-off is the computational intractability to derive the hyper-box representation from a given graph. Thus to demonstrate the discontinuous behavior with this linear model, random interval graphs are first constructed and then their intersection forms the observable graph G.

Evolutionary Interval Graphs

An evolutionary interval graph, Jr, parameterized by variable r is to choose the mid-point of the intervals uniformly at random between

[formula]

[\cite=scheinerman1990evolution]. The variable r is also known as the "radius" of the random mid-points. It is similar to the Erds-Rényi graph where increasing r changes the graph from an empty (sparse) graph to a complete (dense) graph. Similarly there is a phase transition for the evolutionary interval graph where the graph is connected with high probability. This interval graph ensemble allows us to parameterized the model such that the rate of discontinuous flow can be varied.

Phase Transition

Let Jr be an evolutionary interval graph where the intervals' length are chosen randomly from

[formula]

Therefore the threshold of the phase transition is at r  ~   log n / n, and the following provides a more detailed structural understanding at the threshold:

Let Jr be an evolutionary interval graph where the intervals' length are chosen randomly from

[formula]

To model the discontinuity of information flow, it is simpler to assume that the graph [formula] is connected. Since the edge set of interval graph Ek  ⊇  E, thus if G is connected then Jkr is connected for all k. Therefore to construct a connected graph G, it is necessarily (but insufficient) that the set of evolutionary interval graphs are connected (Corollary [\ref=cor:hyperbox_threshold]).

Let graph [formula], where Jkr is the kth evolutionary interval graph and its intervals' length are chosen randomly from

[formula]

Since lim m  →    ∞e- me- c  →  0, it is increasing harder to generate a connected graph of increasing dimension from a set of random evolutionary interval graphs with fixed r. Hence in the experiments we incrementally increase r such that the graph is connected for sufficiently large r (Fig. [\ref=fig:prob_graph_connected]).

An easier alternative is to first construct a dense interval graph J (of any type of ensemble like [\cite=miyoshi2008scale]) and then derive the connected subgraph G by randomly choosing the edges from J. The connectedness of G on n vertices can be ensured by iteratively choosing random edges, or by the critical threshold theory of Erds-Rényi graph that almost all graphs with ≈  n ln n edges are connected [\cite=citeulike:4012374].

This allows us to demonstrate this framework more efficiently without the need to repeat the process to construct random set of evolutionary interval graphs. However there is no way to parameterize this alternative such that we can vary the rate of discontinuity. Thus in the experiments we have to use the less efficient method.

Propagation Models

Given a connected graph [formula], the dynamics of the infection model and influence model are applied to one of the interval graphs Jkr. For example in the infection model, the active vertices in Jkr infects their adjacent inactive vertices with a fixed probability. Since the adjacent vertices in Jkr are not necessarily adjacent in G, the discontinuity of information flow can be observed from the perspective of G, which means that information flow is disrupted in G.

Infection Model

The framework of a typical infection model is the process where active vertices can transmit the infection to inactive vertices with a fixed probability per unit time. Concurrently active vertices can recover at a constant rate. The ratio between the infection rate and the recovery rate determines the spread of the infection (epidemic) across the network. This is also known as the SIR (susceptible-infectious-recovered) process [\cite=Christley15112005].

However in this study the rate of recovery is not relevant at this stage to understand the discontinuous flow of information (infection). This simplification is analogous to the spread of news or gossips across social networks via word of mouth [\cite=sela]. The rate of infection follows the assumption that an inactive vertex v is more susceptible to be infected if most of its neighbors are active. Thus

[formula]

An instance of discontinuity is when a vertex is infected despite having no active neighbors, i.e. infected with zero probability on Eq. [\ref=eq:infection].

Influence Model

In the influence process, an inactive vertex in a network becomes active if a sufficient ratio of its adjacent vertices are active. At each time step, all inactive vertices update their status based on the number of active vertices in their neighborhood. This is similar to the behavior of fashion trends in social networks where "non-adopters" (inactive) vertices follows the style under the influence of their peers.

Typically a fixed threshold τ is given in the influence model where an inactive vertex becomes active if the ratio of the number of active neighbors to neighbors is greater than τ. Hence much more active vertices are required to influence a high degree vertex than a vertex with fewer neighbors. Therefore it is possible to reach an equilibrium when information no longer spread across the network, where there are insufficient active vertices to influence inactive high degree vertices [\cite=kempe2003maximizing].

Let v be one of the inactive vertex in a network with threshold τv and the set of its neighbors be Nv. In the generalized model, each neighbor u∈N has a weighted influence wu,v on vertex v, such that [formula]. Hence in each iteration v will be active if

[formula]

where N'v is the set of active neighbors of v.

In the experiments, the following simplifications are assumed. The thresholds for every vertex are equal, i.e. [formula], and the weighted influence is balance, i.e. wu,v = 1 / |Nv|. From the perspective of the graph G, if an inactive vertex becomes active despite not fulfilling Eq. [\ref=eq:influence], then this phenomenon is defined as an instance of discontinuity in the information flow. In this model, discontinuity is also defined if v remains inactive even when it is above the threshold.

Experimental Results

Fig. [\ref=fig:discontinuity] is a proof of concept that it is possible to simulate any rate of discontinuity with evolutionary interval graphs. We define the rate of discontinuity = 1 when the graph is disconnected so that the plot fits a Sigmoid-like function. Moreover if we assume that all the vertices eventually have to be active, then isolated vertices that becomes active must be under the influence of some discontinuity. Regardless it is more meaningful (at this point) to look at the propagation when r is large.

As r increases the graph (from the intersection of all the interval graphs) becomes denser and every vertex has an edge connecting to most of the other vertices. Thus the effects of discontinuity is not apparent. For example under the infection model, a vertex tends to have more neighbors in the interval graph than the graph itself. This affects Eq. [\ref=eq:infection], i.e. the probability that a vertex will be infected from the perspective of the graph is different from the "true" measurement from the perspective of the interval graph.

Although in real-world system, the interval graphs do not necessarily belong to the ensemble of evolutionary interval graphs. The experiments is simply to support the hypothesis that the framework of interval graphs is a deterministic way to model discontinuity in network propagation. However Fig. [\ref=fig:discontinuity] also allows us to suggest that the greater the boxicity (complexity), the more likely we expect the network to exhibit discontinuity.

The explanation is that it is unlikely (by random chance) the edges in one of the interval graphs to be in all the other interval graphs. Hence the greater the boxicity, the more likely an edge will not be reflected on the graph itself. Therefore there will be many edges from all the interval graphs that are not on the graph and increase the change of discontinuity.

However most importantly it is also possible that the propagation "switch" dimension, i.e. instead of continuing to follow the edges of a particular interval graph, the information can spread via the edges of another interval graph. For example in Fig. [\ref=fig:interval], information can flow from the horizontal interval A' to B' and then "jump" to E'' via the vertical interval. Thus the greater the boxicity, the more dimensions (degree of freedom) for the propagation to switch about and further increase the rate of discontinuity.

Discussion

Although in principle interval graphs can be used as a framework to simulate the discontinuity of information propagation, it is important to figure out its role in our existing understanding of Network Science. For example what insights it can deliver that existing models fail to, vice versa. More importantly even if a model fits the data, it must have meaningful contexts to relate to the dynamics of the system.

One of the advantages of a deterministic model is that the simulations can easily be repeatable once the direction of the flow is chosen. This property can be mimic easily by other probabilistic models by choosing a pseudo-random number generator with a fixed seed. However the slight difference is that in our deterministic framework, the dynamics of Eq. [\ref=eq:infection] and Eq. [\ref=eq:influence] can remain probabilistic. This implies this model (as oppose to others) can control the general direction of the information flow, but not the propagation dynamics.

We emphasized that this framework is an alternative and not a replacement for existing models as we understand the subjectivity of embedding relational information in networks. Given that there are meaningful contexts of intervals graphs with complex systems like Ecology and Bioinformatics, we believe that there should be valid applications in the broader scope of Network Science such that this framework aptly models the system. For example time dependent systems like the EEG or fMRI time series of brain networks.

"Approximating" Boxicity Using Communities Detection

In the previous sections, this paper presents the alternative perspectives of complexity using interval graphs for Network Science. However the applicability for real world systems will remain limited since to determine a network's boxicity is a NP-complete problem.

Although a network's boxicity can be bounded by their maximum degree (section [\ref=sec:hyperbox]), the bound is generally not tight. Moreover the boxicity of a network is an unstable and non-monotonous function where it fluctuates unpredictability when new edges/nodes are added to the network. Hence the intolerance to experimental errors further challenge the applicability of boxicity.

Minimum Boxicity of Network from its Communities

We propose that communities detection is a key strategy to resolve the above problems. It is similar to optimizing the Hamiltonian Walk problem by simplifying a network into modular structures [\cite=Jones]. Firstly the boxicity of a community (induced subgraph) is a simpler problem since it is a smaller network. This can be more meaningful for problems where the understanding of the individual communities is more important than the entire network.

Since the boxicity of a graph is at least the boxicity of its subgraph [\cite=roberts69], thus:

Boxicity(G)  ≥   max g∈CBoxicity(g), where C is the set of communities in graph G.

For instance there are two communities in the Zachary Karate Club Network with 17 vertices in community A and 16 vertices in community B (Top diagram in Fig. [\ref=fig:zachary]). The network is not an interval graph as vertices {24,25,26,28} is not chordal (theorem [\ref=interval_test]). Now that the communities are small, we are able to easily deduce that community A has boxicity = 2 and community B has boxicity > 2 (no solution found via exhaustive search).

But given that community B is a planar graph, its boxicity ≤  3 [\cite=thomassen1986]. This implies the boxicity of community B is 3. Therefore the boxicity of the Zachary Karate Club Network ≥  3 (lemma [\ref=lemma:sub_boxicity]). The bottom diagram in Fig. [\ref=fig:zachary] shows one of the possible hyperbox representations of the communities. Since we have to eventually combine these partial solutions, it will be useful to constrain the partial solutions where the vertices of a community that connects to the other communities have to be aligned along the boundaries of the hyperboxes.

Fig. [\ref=fig:zachary3d] slightly rearranged the hyperboxes in Fig. [\ref=fig:zachary] such that the boxes at the boundaries the communities can be easily combined. From the figure, we can conclude that it does not take more than 3-dimensions to combine the communities. Hence the boxicity of Zachary Karate Club Network is 3.

Boxcity of the Communities' Interaction Network

Lastly communities detection allows us to look at the problem from a more general perspective. It represents a broad overview on how information flows from one community to another. The complexity (boxicity) of this modular structure is important to understand the information propagation of a network.

This is done by coarsening the network G with a new network H where the vertices in H represents the communities of G, and the vertices in H are adjacent if and only if their corresponding communities in G are connected. Since H is a smaller network than G, the computation of the boxicity of H is easier. This process can be repeated on H until we get the desired granularity.

In our previous example, the Zachary Karate Club Network, there is only two communities and they are connected. Hence the coarse network is just a complete graph on two vertices, i.e. an interval graph with boxicity = 1. This implies that the information flow has low complexity where there is a linear flow from one community to another.

Boxicity with Experimental Noise

The conclusion from the previous example is trivial since there are only two communities. However it is interesting to note that the conclusion remains the same when we remove/add (a small number of) edges from/to the network. These modifications can represent the noise in the experiments and hence more relevant for scientific applications.

The instability of boxicity due to noise was the reason to why Quasi-Interval Graph, Q, was introduced. It is a graph with boxicity > 1 that can be expressed as an interval graph by adding or subtracting some edges as experimental errors from Q. It is useful for systems where there are strong qualitative evidences that they have linear structure [\cite=stouffer2006robust] [\cite=cattin2004phylogenetic] [\cite=mouillot2008high]. This can be done by finding the minimum number of edges to 1) add to Q [\cite=kaplan1999bounded] [\cite=kaplan1999tractability] [\cite=natanzon2000polynomial], 2) remove from Q [\cite=goldberg1995four] or 3) a mixture of both types of errors [\cite=lu2003clustering]. For example community B in the Zachary Karate Club Network will have boxicity = 2 (instead of 3) if vertices 26 and 34 are adjacent (Fig. [\ref=fig:zachary]).

However it is still a hard problem to minimize the number of modification over the entire network such that its boxicity is also minimized. Thus is more intuitive and easier to understand the general dynamics of a system with the coarsen network than the precise boxicity of the network.

Discussions

Information flow across interval graphs is an established model in ecology research to understand the stability of complex systems. However to relate this to the broader applications in Network Science has yet to be attempted. For instance the simulations show that as a proof of concept, interval graphs are viable linear fine structures to model the real world characteristic of discontinuous information propagation. The advantage of this framework is that the intuitions of the dynamics are not obscure by random processes.

In addition we show that the methodologies in Network Science can be useful to resolve some of the challenges of interval graph and boxicity. For example communities detection algorithms modularize the network such that the problem of boxicity can be simplified. Furthermore the communities allow us to focus on the complexity of the general network topology rather than the details within the communities which are prone to experimental errors.

Given the growing interests for multi-relational networks, we believe that interval graphs will appeal to scientists and complement their research. In addition the modern methodologies and tools from Network Science can further improve the computational hardness of boxicity. Thus revisiting interval graphs will broaden our perspective of complexity theory.
