Entropy degeneration of convex projective surfaces

Introduction and statement of results

Let Σ be a closed oriented surface of genus at least 2. A strictly convex real projective structure (referred to simply as "convex projective structure" in the sequel) is by definition a [formula] geometric structure whose developing map is a homeomorphism from the universal cover [formula] to a bounded convex open set in an affine chart [formula].

It is a theorem of J. Loftin [\cite=loftin_amer] and F. Labourie [\cite=labourie_cubic] that the moduli space P(Σ) of convex projective structures on Σ naturally identifies with the moduli space C(Σ) of pairs [formula], where [formula] is a conformal structure on Σ and [formula] is a holomorphic cubic differential on the Riemann surface [formula]. The space C(Σ) is a holomorphic vector bundle of rank 5(g - 1) over the Teichmüller space T(Σ), the fiber over [formula] being the space [formula] of holomorphic cubic differentials on [formula]. The natural inclusion [formula] identifies T(Σ) as the zero section of the vector bundle.

Taking the volume entropy of the Hilbert metric (see Section [\ref=sec_proof] below for the definitions) for each element of P(Σ) yields a function [formula].

The Hilbert metric for a point in the Teichmüller space T(Σ)  ⊂  P(Σ) is just the hyperbolic metric representing that point. Its entropy is just 1. On the other hand, M. Crampon proved in [\cite=crampon] that [formula] is strictly less than 1 outside T(Σ). Motivated by a question of Crampon, we constructed in [\cite=nie_1] certain paths in P(Σ) along which [formula] tends to 0 (the construction works for dimensions 3 and 4 as well, here we only look at dimension 2 though). Using different techniques, T. Zhang constructed in [\cite=zhang] some submanifolds of P(Σ) with the same property. In view of these constructions, one naturally guess that [formula] tends to 0 along any sequence going away from T(Σ). The purpose of this note is to prove such a statement. Namely, The "only if" part is an immediate consequence of the continuity of the map [formula] and the continuity of the Labourie-Loftin bijection [formula]. However, to the knowledge of the author, a proof of the latter does not exist in the literature, so we will give an alternative proof of the above theorem without using these continuities.

The theorem is a simple manifestation of the general philosophy that a degenerating convex projective surface looks bigger and bigger and more and more flat. See [\cite=loftin_limit] [\cite=parreau] for more circumstantial statements confirming this philosophy.

The proof and speculations

We first briefly review the backgrounds.

Let [formula] be the universal cover of Σ and Γ  =  π1(Σ) be the fundamental group. Let g be either a Riemannian metric, a Finsler metric or a flat metric with conic singularities on Σ. Fix a base point [formula]. The volume entropy of g can be defined as

[formula]

where the symbol "#  " means taking the cardinal of a set, while Γ.x0 is the Γ-orbit of x0 and [formula] is the ball of radius R centered at x0 with respect to the distance on [formula] induced by the lift of g.

We will make use of the following properties of the entropy:

The scaling property: [formula] for any t > 0.

Given metrics g1 and g2, if their induced distances d1 and d2 on [formula] are quasi-isometric in the sense that

[formula]

for some constants a > 1 and b > 0, then

[formula]

A theorem of Katok [\cite=katok]: for any Riemannian metric g on Σ, the normalized entropy [formula] (which is invariant under scaling) satisfies

[formula]

where [formula] is any hyperbolic metric on Σ and χ(Σ) is the Euler characteristic of Σ. Furthermore, equality occurs if and only if g is hyperbolic.

An important consequence of the second property is that

[formula]

This follows from the varc-Milnor Lemma, which implies that the distance on [formula] induced by a geodesic metric is isometric to the hyperbolic plane.

A convex projective structure on Σ gives rise to the following objects on Σ (see [\cite=loftin_amer] [\cite=labourie_cubic] [\cite=benoist-hulin] [\cite=nie_2] for details):

a Finsler metric [formula], called the Hilbert metric;

a Riemannian metric [formula], called the Blaschke metric;

a holomorphic cubic differential [formula] with respect to the conformal structure underlying [formula], called the Pick differential.

Moreover, [formula] and [formula] satisfy Wang's equation

[formula]

Here [formula] is the curvature of [formula] and [formula] is the pointwise norm of [formula] with respect to [formula], namely, if [formula] and [formula] in a local coordinate z, then

[formula]

The Labourie-Loftin theorem says that, for each pair [formula] mentioned in the introduction, there is a unique Riemannian metric g conformal to [formula] such that g and [formula] are respectively the Blaschke metric and the Pick differential of a convex projective structure. This gives the identification [formula] discussed in the introduction.

The entropy [formula] of the Hilbert metric is an interesting and systematically studied quantity because it equals the topological entropy of an interesting dynamical system - the geodesic flow of a convex projective surface (see [\cite=crampon]).

As in the introduction, with an abuse of notation, we also let [formula] denote the function assigning to each convex projective structure the entropy of its Hilbert metric.

Proposition 3.4 in [\cite=benoist-hulin] implies that there is universal constant c > 1 such that the Hilbert metric [formula] and the Blaschke metric [formula] of any convex projective structure on Σ satisfy

[formula]

for any tangent vector v of Σ. Here [formula] and [formula] denotes the norm of v with respect to [formula] and [formula], respectively. As a consequence, we have

[formula]

Given a convex projective structure with Blaschke metric [formula] and Pick differential [formula], we consider the flat metric with conic singularity [formula]. By definition, if [formula] under a conformal local coordinate z, then [formula].

It is a well known fact that [formula] has non-positive curvature (see e.g. [\cite=nie_2] Coro. 6.2), or equivalently, there is a pointwise majorization

[formula]

(the equivalence follows from Wang's equation ([\ref=eqn_wang])). Therefore we have

[formula]

Let [formula] be a sequence in [formula] tending to infinity. In view of ([\ref=eqn_bh]) and ([\ref=eqn_ent]), in order to prove the "if" part of the theorem, it is sufficient to show that [formula] tends to 0.

To this end, we note that the function

[formula]

is continuous, because for [formula], the quasi-isometry constant a in ([\ref=eqn_quasiiso]) between the lifts of [formula] and [formula] tends to 1 as [formula] approaches [formula]. Therefore, if we fix a norm [formula] on V and let [formula] be the unit sphere, then [formula] exists. Thus

[formula]

The last term tends to 0 because [formula] tends to +    ∞  , as required.

In order to prove the "only if" part of the theorem without using the continuity of the Labourie-Loftin bijection, as mentioned in the introduction, we need the following lemma.

The Wang's equation ([\ref=eqn_wang]) satisfied by [formula] and [formula] can be written as

[formula]

Integrating both sides over Σ with respect to the volume form of [formula], then applying Gauss-Bonnet Formula to the first term on the right-hand side, we get

[formula]

To prove the lemma, it is sufficient to show that the integrand [formula] in the last term above is pointwise majorized by the volume form [formula] of [formula], but this follows from the inequality ([\ref=eqn_bp]): assuming [formula] and [formula] in a local coordinate [formula], we have

[formula]

Let [formula] be the Blaschke metric of the convex projective structure corresponding to [formula] and assume that

[formula]

We need to prove that the cubic differential [formula] tends to infinity in [formula], or equivalently, the total area of the associated flat metric [formula] tends to infinity. But this follows from Katok's inequality ([\ref=eqn_katok]) and the above lemma, because they imply

[formula]

This completes the proof of the theorem.

To conclude, we give some comments on the case where Σ is a punctured surface of finite type, i.e. Σ is obtained from a closed oriented surface by removing finitely many punctures. As a generalization of the Labourie-Loftin identification [formula], Benoist and Hulin [\cite=benoist-hulin] identified the space of convex projective structures with finite Hilbert volume with the space of those pairs [formula] where [formula] is a punctured Riemann surface structure and [formula] is a holomorphic cubic differential with at most second order pole at each puncture. We gave in [\cite=nie_2] a further generalization.

The above theorem holds perhaps in these more general settings as well. However, the above proof does not work. Indeed, at a pole of order ≤  2 , the metric [formula] is incomplete and its pullback to the universal cover is not quasi-isometric to the hyperbolic plane, hence whether [formula] has finite entropy remains a problem.
