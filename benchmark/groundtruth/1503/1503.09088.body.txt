A remark on spaces of affine continuous functions on a simplex

Introduction and Preliminaries

In the Concluding remarks in [\cite=Zippin1969], the author claims that a separable predual of an abstract L1 space contains a (complemented) copy of c (the Banach space of real convergent sequences) if its unit ball has an extreme point. Only a sketch of the proof of this property was indicated. In particular there is no proof that the extreme point and the sequence {yn} (1-equivalent to the standard basis of c0 built in the main theorem of [\cite=Zippin1969]), span a subspace isometric to c. The aim of this paper is to present a simple example that disproves Zippin's claim. Moreover, in the last section of our paper we point out that our example also shows that some known results, establishing geometrical properties of polyhedral Banach spaces, are incorrect.

Let BX (SX) denote the closed unit ball (sphere) in a real Banach space X and X* denotes the dual of X. If K is a compact, convex subset of a linear topological space, then by K we denote the set of all extreme points of K. A convex subset F of BX is called a face of BX if for every x,y∈BX and λ∈(0,1) such that (1 - λ)x + λy∈F we have x,y∈F. A face F of BX is named a proper face if F  ≠  BX. Here c denotes the Banach space of all real convergent sequences and A(K) stands for a simplex space, that is, the space of all affine continuous functions on a Choquet simplex K endowed with the supremum norm. It is well known that [formula] and the duality is given by:

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula]. A Banach space X is called an L1-predual space or a Lindenstrauss space if its dual is isometric to L1(μ) for some measure μ. It is well known that this class includes all the simplex spaces. Moreover a Lindenstrauss space X is isometric to a simplex space if and only if BX has at least one extreme point (see [\cite=Semadeni1964]). Finally, we recall that a Banach space X is polyhedral if the unit balls of all its finite-dimensional subspaces are polytopes (see [\cite=Klee]).

A simplex space not containing c

We begin by providing a necessary condition for the presence of a copy of c in a separable Banach space X.

Let X be a separable Banach space. If X contains a subspace linearly isometric to c, then there exist x∈X and a sequence (e*n)  ⊂  BX* such that (e*n) is w*-convergent to e*, [formula] and [formula] for every [formula].

Assume that X contains an isometric copy of c. Consider

[formula]

the sequence [formula] defined by

[formula]

and the sequence [formula] defined by

[formula]

Let [formula] denote a norm preserving linear extension of x*n to the whole X. Next, let us define the sets Fn, [formula], by

[formula]

It is easy to see that

[formula] for every [formula] (because [formula]),

Fn is a w*-closed proper face of BX*, for every [formula],

[formula] provided m  ≠  n.

Hence, [formula] by the Krein-Milman Theorem, Fn  ⊂  BX* for every [formula] and [formula] whenever m  ≠  n.

Let e*n∈Fn  ⊂  BX*. We can assume that (e*n) is w*-convergent, let us say to e*. Then

[formula] for every [formula],

[formula] for every [formula].

Consequently, for every [formula], we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

The previous theorem gives a corollary which allows us to show that the announced example does not contain c.

Let X be a predual of [formula]. If X contains a subspace isometric to c then there exist x∈BX and a subsequence [formula] of the standard basis [formula] in [formula] such that

[formula] and [formula] for every [formula], where for [formula] we put [formula],

e*nk(x) = e*(x) = 1 for every [formula].

Let

[formula]

The hyperplane W has the following properties:

The map [formula] defined by

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] is an onto isometry. Moreover, if [formula] denotes the standard basis of [formula], then

[formula]

(see Theorem 4.3 in [\cite=Casini-Miglierina-Piasecki2014]).

From Corollary [\ref=c_in_l_1_predual] we conclude that W does not contain a subspace linearly isometric to c.

By Corollary 2 in [\cite=Japon-Prus2004] the set

[formula]

is an infinite dimensional [formula]-closed proper face of [formula].

It is easy to see that [formula]. Consequently, as was observed in [\cite=Semadeni1964], W is isometric to A(K). Nevertheless, in our special case this property can be shown directly.

In order to prove that the space W is polyhedral we need a characterization of polyhedrality given by Durier and Papini (Theorem 2 in [\cite=Durier-Papini]): a Banach space X is polyhedral if and only if the set

[formula]

is a closed set for every x∈SX. Moreover, we remark that x∈SW if and only if there exists at least one index [formula] such that [formula]. Then, an easy computation shows that

[formula]

where I(x) = {i:x(i) = 1} and J(x) = {j:x(j) =  - 1}. Therefore the set C(x) is closed for every x∈SW.

Example [\ref=example_W_f] shows that property (2) in Corollary [\ref=c_in_l_1_predual] does not imply that c  ⊂  X. Also property (1) in the same corollary does not imply that c  ⊂  X. Indeed, to this end is sufficient to consider a different hyperplane of c:

[formula]

By using Theorem 4.3 in [\cite=Casini-Miglierina-Piasecki2014] we have that [formula] and

[formula]

It is easy to see that does not exist x∈V satisfying the property (2) in Corollary [\ref=c_in_l_1_predual]. Therefore V does not contain an isometric copy of c. It would be desirable to understand if the simultaneous validity of conditions (1) and (2) ensures the presence of a isometric copy of c in a predual of [formula], but we have not been able to do this. Nevertheless we show that the necessary condition expressed in Theorem [\ref=c_in_a_separable_Banach_space] is not a sufficient condition in a general framework. Indeed, let us consider the space [formula] and the sequence [formula] in [formula] defined by

[formula]

Then

[formula],

[formula] for every [formula],

[formula] for every [formula],

for [formula] we have x*(e1) = x*n(e1) = 1

but [formula] does not contain c.

Final remarks

Different authors refer to Zippin's statement. We focus on a paper by Lazar that gives a characterization of polyhedral Lindenstrauss spaces.

In [\cite=Lazar1969], the implication (1)⇒  (3) in Theorem 3 is incorrect. Indeed, W is a polyhedral space but BW* contains an infinite dimensional w*-closed proper face (see items (e) and (c) in Example [\ref=example_W_f]). As a consequence of this remark we have that some of the implications stated in the theorem mentioned above reveal to be unproven. For instance, the implication (1)⇒  (4) has no proof.

The result of Lazar has been subsequently used by Gleit and McGuigan in [\cite=Gleit-McGuigan1972] to provide another characterization of polyhedral Lindenstrauss spaces. We remark that, in [\cite=Gleit-McGuigan1972], the implication (3)⇒  (1) in Theorem 1.2 is incorrect. Indeed, W does not contain an isometric copy of c and for [formula] in W and the w*-limit [formula] of the standard basis in [formula] we have (see items (b) and (a) in Example [\ref=example_W_f])

[formula]

Also, the implication (3)⇒  (1) in Corollary 2.7 is incorrect because W is a simplex space (see item (d) in Example [\ref=example_W_f]).
