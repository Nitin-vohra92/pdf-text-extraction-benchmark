Abstract

A preferential arrangement of a finite set is an ordered partition. Associated with each such ordered partition is a chain of subsets or blocks endowed with a linear order. The chain may be split into sections by the introduction of a vertical bar, leading to the notion of a barred preferential arrangements. In this paper we derive some combinatorial identities satisfied by the number of possible barred preferential arrangements of an n-element set. We illustrate with some suitable examples highlighting some important consequences of the identities.

introduction

The study of preferential arrangements in Combinatorics goes back to Cayley in [\cite=cayley:1859]. Further studies of these objects were made by Gross[\cite=gross:1962], Mendelson[\cite=mendelson:1982] and others. More recently Pippenger studied special kind of preferential arrangements and called them barred preferential arrangements in [\cite=Pippenger:2010]. The same further generalised in [\cite=barred:2013]. In this paper we derive several identities using combinatorial arguments, thus answering a comments raised by Pippenger in [\cite=Pippenger:2010].In preliminaries we gather known results on preferential and barred preferential arrangements. In section 4 we state and prove several identities involving the number of barred preferential arrangements of an n-element set. In proving the identities we use combinatorial arguments. In section 5 we discuss some identities involving restricted barred preferential arrangements. Throughout the paper we illustrate the concept with some simple examples.

Preliminaries

In this section we collect all the preliminaries and known results setting up convenient notations for the discussion of barred preferential arrangements. We refer to the papers [\cite=barred:2013] and [\cite=Pippenger:2010] for discussions and results on barred preferential arrangements.

[formula] Preferential arrangement. A partition of a set [formula] with n elements is a collection of disjoint non-empty subsets whose union is Xn. The subsets forming the partition are called blocks. If the blocks are arranged in a linear order, the ordered partition is referred as a preferential arrangement of Xn. see [\cite=gross:1962], [\cite=mendelson:1982]. For example, {{1},{2,3}} is a preferential arrangement of X3 with two blocks with the natural ordering {1}  ≤  {2,3}. For convenience we write this preferential arrangement as 1      23, reading the block containing 1 comes first and the block containing 23 comes second. From now onwards we will use the natural ordering of blocks as illustrated here. A warning: The natural ordering of the numbers [formula] in not relevant here but the ordering of the blocks are. Let Qn and Jn denote the set of preferential arrangements of Xn and the number of preferential arrangements of Xn, so that |Qn| = Jn. The numbers Jn for [formula] are also known as Fubini numbers and a list of values of Jn for [formula] can be found in OEIS sequence number A000670, [\cite=oeis]. The number Jn is interpreted as the number of outcomes in a race with n participants assuming all of them finish the race and ties are allowed [\cite=mendelson:1982] or the number of restricted preferential fuzzy subsets of Xn, [\cite=murali:Nelsongenerating_function]. The numbers Jn satisfy a recurrence relation with the initial condition J0 = 1, or identity as a finite sum, see [\cite=mendelson:1982] or an infinite sum, see [\cite=gross:1962] or a closed form involving Stirling numbers of the second kind [\cite=Pippenger:2010], respectively

[formula]

[formula] Barred Preferential arrangements. The idea of introducing bars in between the blocks of a preferential arrangement seems first to appear in [\cite=Pippenger:2010] even though the numbers associated with counting barred preferential arrangements appear much earlier in the literature [\cite=com:74]. For example, for the preferential arrangement [formula] considered in [formula], we can insert one bar | in three different places in three different ways ( what a coincidence!) as follows: 1  |    23 or |  1    23 or 1    23  |, whereas a two-bar insertion into the same [formula] would give rise to 6 barred preferential arrangements. viz., 1  |  |    23, |  |  1    23, 1    23  |  |, 1  |    23  |, |  1    23  | or |  1    |23. We now illustrate what we mean by sections associated with bars. Consider two 3-bar preferential arrangements of X7 with 4 blocks.

[formula]

[formula]

We notice that in general m bars induce m + 1 sections with some of the sections possibly empty.

In general we denote the number of barred preferential arrangements of Xn with m bars (m  ≥  0) by Jmn. In addition to the numbers Jmn, we use Qmn for the set of all barred preferential arrangements of Xn with m bars (m  ≥  0). Hence |Qmn|  =  Jmn. When m = 0, J0n (|Q0n|) identified as simply the number ( the set) of preferential arrangements without any bars and therefore is equal to Jn ( Qn ) according to the notation in subsection [formula] . For instance J22  =  15,J54  =  5340 can be verified by direct manual counting of such barred preferential arrangements. The following closed form for Jmn and the recurrence relation with the initial condition Jm0  =  1,Jm1  =  m + 1 satisfied by it are obtained by Ahlbach et al in [\cite=barred:2013]

[formula]

The infinite sum representation for Jmn corresponding to similar expression for preferential arrangement is bit more involved.

[formula]

again where s(m,t) is the Stirling numbers of the first kind.

[formula] Restricted Barred Preferential arrangements. We also discuss some identities based on barred preferential arrangements with some restrictions. Consider the following restriction on a preferential arrangement [formula] of Xn with m bars. There are m + 1 sections. We fix a specific section, say the (m  +  1)th section, namely the last section. After fixing the section, we impose the restriction that every other section to have at most one block. We then preferentially arrange the elements of the blocks of the fixed section. we then call such a barred preferential arrangement a restricted barred preferential arrangement. We denote the set of all restricted barred preferential arrangements of Xn having m bars by Hmn. The order of the set Hmn is denoted by the number Imn. In the proofs involving the set Hmn, it is occasionally useful to consider one extra bar [formula] introduced on the elements of Hmn at the far right hand end of the last section. It will be clear in the proofs that such an introduction of an extra bar does not affect counting. Therefore we use set *  ¶mn for elements of Hmn with [formula]. Both Hmn and *  ¶mn have the same cardinality Imn.

The identities

In this section we develop a number of interesting identities satisfied by Jmn and for various non-negative integral values of n and m. The proofs are combinatorial arguments based on preferential arrangements. The first identity was found in [\cite=Pippenger:2010] without proof or reference. Further the author of that paper states that such an identity can be proved combinatorially or otherwise. Here below we state and prove that result as a lemma.

Let n be an non-negative integer. Then [formula]

proof: What we are required to prove is that the number of preferential arrangements with no bars can be written as a sum of barred preferential arrangements with one bar. The left hand side of the identity can be interpreted combinatorially as outcomes in a race of n + 1 people ( assuming that all people finish the race )[\cite=mendelson:1982]. The terms on the right hand side would correspond to races of n people, of which the people are preferentially arranged with respect to a single bar ( hence the superscript of J is 1 ). In proving the lemma, use a similar method to the one used in [\cite=mendelson:1982] in establishing equation (7)). We need to associate each term on the left with one term on the right and visa versa for the identity to hold. Therefore we first mark a person out of n + 1 people who are to run a race. We interpret the block having the marked person as a bar. Clearly all outcomes of the race would not be affected whether a specific person is marked or not. In our notation the number of outcomes is captured by J0n + 1 (by definition of J0n + 1). We ask the following question in order to identify each outcome that is counted by J0n + 1is interpreted as an outcome in the sum on the right hand side and visa versa: How many people do not finish with the marked person? The block having the marked person would serve as the bar in a barred preferential arrangement counted on the right hand side of the identity. There are [formula] ways of choosing s people who do not finish with the marked person for each s such that 0  ≤  s  ≤  n. For each such s, there are J1s ways of preferentially arranging the s people with the block having the marked person serving as the bar. Therefore there are [formula] many number of barred preferential arrangement of the s people each of which is a preferential arrangement of n + 1 persons finishing a race. Clearly the preceding argument uniquely identifies each outcome of the LHS as an outcome of the RHS.

We generalize Lemma [\ref=lemma:1] to the case of multiple bars in the following way,

For two integers [formula], [formula]

proof: In forming a barred preferential arrangement of an n + 1-persons as in Lemma one above, with m bars, we mark one of the n persons. The position of the marked person would be determined by two quantities, one: the section in which the marked person finishes in and two: the block in which he finishes within the section. The block in which the marked person is in, is interpreted as the m  +  1th bar on the right hand side. Let us assume that the marked person is in section i. The question is: how many people do not finish with the marked person? Let us say there are s of them, those s people can be selected in [formula] ways. There are Jm + 1s ways of preferentially arranging the s persons, where the m  +  1th bar is the block having the marked person. Summing over s we have [formula] number of preferential arrangements. If the marked person finishes in section k instead of section i above, we would still have [formula] many preferential arrangements. Since there are m + 1 sections hence the total number of preferential arrangements is [formula].

After putting the sums in theorem [\ref=theorem:1] in a Pascal like triangle for fixed values of m and n, we obtain the following corollaries.

J12 = 4  ×  J11

We prove the corollary combinatorially by establishing a bijection between a set Q12 whose cardinality is J12 and a set {0,1}2  ×  {0,1}1  ×  Q11 whose cardinality is 4  ×  J11. We denote by Qmn the set of barred preferential arrangements of a n-element set having m bar. We have, [formula], |Q12|=J12(by definition of Q1n). We say Q11  =  {|a,a|}. In proving the corollary we generalise the method used in [\cite=barred:2013] in proving theorem 2.1 from a single label of a bar to a double label of a bar, in the following way. We consider a map f:{0,1}2  ×  {0,1}1  ×  Q11  →  Q12. We construct the set{0,1}2  ×  {0,1}1  ×  Q11 in the following way, 1. {0,1}1 labels one of the elements of Q11 with a binary label 0 or 1 at the bottom. Hence from the two element of Q11 there will result four labeled barred preferential arrangements. The set [formula]. 2. Then {0,1}2 labels at the top, the four elements of {0,1}1  ×  Q11 to form eight elements of {0,1}2  ×  {0,1}1  ×  Q11 in the following way, [formula] We now define a mapping from {0,1}2  ×  {0,1}1  ×  Q11 to Q12 in the following way, . If the indexes on the bar are both 0, then for a barred preferential arrangement, by introducing a second element b, place a and b as a single block on the side of the bar where a was(in all cases remove the indices on the bars). An example of such an arrangement is |ab. . If the top index on the bar is 0 and the bottom index on the bar is 1, then remove the indexing on the bar and place b on opposite side of the bar from a in obtaining an element of Q12. An example of such an arrangement is a|b. . If the top index on the bar is 1 and the bottom index is 0, then place the two elements on the same side of the bar but placing the element b on its on block immediately before the bar then following by the block of the element a. An example of such an arrangement is, [formula]. . If both index are equal to 1, then place both elements on separate block on the same side of the ba, where now as opposed to 3 above the immediate block before the bar will be that of a then followed by the block of b. an example of such an arrangement is [formula]. From the way we have constructed the function f, two elements of {0,1}2  ×  {0,1}1  ×  Q11 satisfy each of the four conditions above and each element of {0,1}2  ×  {0,1}1  ×  Q11 is mapped to one element of Q12. Hence the mapping is 1-1. Clear by marking the position of the elements a and b in an element [formula], we can identify an element of {0,1}2  ×  {0,1}1  ×  Q11 which is mapped to [formula]. Hence the map in onto. So [formula] as required.

for m = 1 and n = 1 the identity holds,

J11 = J10 + J01

We prove the corollary by considering a mapping [formula], where Qmn is the set of all barred preferential arrangements of an [formula] element set having [formula] bars. The set Q11  =  {|a,a|}, also [formula]. We define a mapping from Q11 in the following way, . If a is before the bar on [formula] then map [formula] to a in [formula] (this operation behaves as if you remove the bar from [formula], when mapping [formula] to an element of [formula]). . If a is after the bar on [formula] then map [formula] to | in [formula] (this operation behaves as if a is removed from [formula] when mapping [formula] to an element of [formula]). Clearly this mapping is a one to one and onto mapping between the two sets of two elements each. So [formula]. Hence J11 = J01 + J10 ([formula] this is so, since the two sets are disjoint). Thus the corollary.

for m = 1 and n = 2 the identity holds,

J12 = 3  ×  J11 + 2  ×  J10

We prove the corollary by establishing a bijection between a set Q12 whose cardinality is J12 and a set [formula], whose cardinality is 3  ×  J11 + 2  ×  J10. Where Qmn denotes the set of all barred preferential arrangements of an [formula] element set having [formula] bars. We say, Q11  =  {|a,a|}. We then construct the set {0,1,2}  ×  Q11 in the following way, [formula],So the bar of each element of Q11 is labeled by either 0, 1 or 2, in forming the set {0,1,2}  ×  Q11. We construct the set {0,1}  ×  Q10 in a similar way to obtain [formula]. So we have, [formula] . Also we have, [formula]. We define a mapping [formula] in the following way, . If [formula] and the indexing on the bar being 0. Then place an element b on opposite side of a. An example of such an arrangement is a|b. . If [formula] and the indexing on the bar being 1, then place an element b on it's own block on the same side as a but the block of a should be the one which is immediately before the bar. An example of such an arrangement is [formula]. . If [formula] and the indexing on the bar being 2. Then place an element b on its own block immediately before the bar, then followed by the block of a. An example of such an arrangement is [formula]. .If [formula] and the index on the bar is 0 then introduce write two elements a and b as a single block to the right of the bar. Hence that element will be mapped to the element |ab in Q12. . If [formula] and the index on the bar is 1 then introduce write two elements a and b as a single block to the left of the bar. Hence that element will be mapped to the element ab| in Q12. From the way we have defined f above, the 1st and the 2nd elements of Q12, satisfy property . The 3rd and the 4th element of Q12 satisfy property . The 5th and the 6th elements of Q12 satisfy property . The 7th element of Q12 satisfy property above. The 8th element of Q12 satisfy property above. From the way we have defined f above, each element of [formula] is mapped to a unique element of Q12. Also using f above, we can move from elements of Q12 to elements of [formula] with out ambiguity. Hence the mapping is bijective. Thus [formula] i.e 3  ×  J11 + 2  ×  J10 = J12 as required(note the sets {0,1,2}  ×  Q11 and the set {0,1}  ×  Q10 are disjoint hence order of their union is the sum of the orders).

for [formula],

[formula]

We recall Jkn is the cardinality of a set Qkn which is the collection of all possible barred preferential arrangements of an n-element having k bars. Each barred preferential arrangement in Qkn has k + 1 section since there are k bars. We prove the theorem by partitioning Qkn into disjoint subsets μ1 and μ2. Where μ1 is the collection of all those elements from Qkn whose first section is empty and μ2 is the collection of all those elements from Qkn whose first section is non-empty. In finding the number of element in μ1 we argue as follows: the first section of [formula] being empty means the n elements are distributed among the k other sections. A distribution of n elements among k sections is a distribution of the elements among k - 1 bars. As a result |μ1| = Jk - 1n.

For the case the first section of each element of Qkn being required to be non-empty we argue as follows in finding the number of elements of μ2: There can be a minimum of 0 elements not in the first section and there can be a maximum of n - 1 elements which are not in the first section on all barred preferential arrangements which are to be in μ2. Lets assume there are s elements which are not in the first section of each barred preferential arrangement. There are [formula] ways of selecting the s elements. There are Jk - 1s ways of preferentially arranging the s elements among the other k sections. There n - s remaining elements can be preferentially arranged on the first section in J0n - s ways. Taking the product and summing over s we obtain [formula]. When we combine μ1 and μ2 we obtain the result of the theorem.

Identities of restricted barred preferential arrangements

We denote by Hmn the set of all barred preferential arrangements of an n element set having m bars, in which m fixed sections (out of m + 1 sections) are allowed to have a maximum of only one block and the other section can have one or more blocks (we refer to this section as the free section). The elements of the free section can have any possible number of blocks of a preferential arrangement of given [formula] elements. So Hmn represents the set of all barred preferential arrangements of an n element set having m bars in which the m fixed (first) sections have a maximum of one block but one fixed section can have more than one block. The free section can be any of the section as long its fixed. We denote by |Hmn| = Imn.

We prove the identity in the following way,

for m = 0 and [formula] we have,

2I0n  =  I1n

We consider the set H0n which is the set of all barred preferential arrangements of an n element set with no bars. Hence all elements of H0n have only one section since there are no bars. We also consider the set H1n, which is the set of all barred preferential arrangement of an n element set having one bar, in which the first section has a at most one block and the second section is just a preferential arrangement of given elements not necessarily into one block.

Adding an extra bar [formula] to the far right of each element of the set H0n does not affect counting. We add an extra bar [formula] to the far right of each element of the set H0n to form the set *  ¶0n, with the extra bar on the far right of each element.In proving the lemma, use a similar method to the one used in [\cite=barred:2013] in proving theorem 2.1 . We have | * ¶0n| = I0n  =  |H0n|. We define the set R*n(0) = {0,1}  ×    *  ¶0n as containing the same elements as *  ¶0n but with an indexing on the bar [formula] which is either 0 or 1, hence R*n(0) has twice the number of elements as *  ¶0n (half of them having the index 0 and the other half the index 1). We now use the elements of R*n(0) to reconstruct the set H1n. We do it as follows:

. If the indexing on the bar [formula] on an element [formula] is 0 then such an element will be interpreted in H1n, as an element of H1n whose 2nd section is empty. We collect all such elements to form the set W. The set W has I0n elements(half of the elements in R*n(0) have the index 0) . If the indexing on the bar [formula] on an element [formula] is 1 then we shift the last block of section 1 to be the only block to the right of the bar [formula] to form the set K. The set K has I0n elements(half of the elements in R*n(0) have the indexing 1) Clearly the sets K and W are disjoint. So we have [formula]. Now what we are having is two sets [formula] and H1n have the same definition(one fixed section can have a maximum of one block and the other section is a free section) and the same number of elements in the underlying sets, So they must be of the same size. Hence [formula]. Thus the lemma.

For the value m = 1, we have the following lemma,

for m = 1 and [formula] we have,

2I1n - 1 = I2n

We consider a set H1n, which is the set of all barred preferential arrangements of an n element set having 1 bar, in which the first section has a maximum of one block each and the 2nd section to be just a preferential arrangement of given elements not necessarily into one block (this is the only section with this property). So the 2nd section of each element of H1n is a free section. We also consider the set H2n, which is the set of all barred preferential arrangements of an n-element set, having 2 bars in which 2 fixed sections have a maximum of one block each and one section can have more than one block (the free section).

We now want to reconstruct H2n using elements of H1n. Adding an extra bar [formula] to the far right of each element of H1n does not affect counting. We do that to form the set *  ¶1n. Now we have | * ¶1n| = I1n = |H1n|. The bar [formula] is to the right of the free sections of elements of H1n. On each element [formula] to the left of the bar [formula] is the free section of [formula] and the section to the right of [formula] is empty. We define the set R*n(1) = {0,1}  ×    *  ¶1n as containing the same elements as *  ¶1n but with an indexing on the bar [formula] which is either 0 or 1, hence R*n(1) has twice the number of elements as *  ¶1n(of which half of them having the indexing 0 and the other half having the index 1). We now use elements of R*n(1) to reconstruct the set H2n. We construct as follows, .If the indexing on the bar [formula] on an element [formula] is 0 then such an element will be interpreted in H2n, as an element of H2n whose 3rd section is empty. We collect all such elements to form the set W. The set W has I1n elements(half of the elements in R*n(1) have the indexing 0) If the indexing on the bar [formula] on an element [formula] is 1 then we shift the last block of the 3rd section of [formula] to be the only block to the right of [formula](i.e the block closest to the bar [formula] on [formula]) to form the set K. There are I1n elements having index 1 in R*n(1)(half of the elements in R*n(1) have the indexing 1). On the construct of the set K some elements of K also appear as elements of the set W. Those redundant elements(elements having identical interpretation in H2n ) occur when there free section on elements of R*n(1) is empty. In that case there is no block to put to the right of the bar [formula] when constructing the set K. In that case we get common elements between K and W. Common elements between K and W occur when the n elements are distributed on the first m sections of H1n of which there is only one way of doing that. So there is one element in the intersection of K and W(when elements of K and W are interpreted as elements of ).

The elements of both sets K and W have 3 sections, of which for those with a fixed [formula], 2 sections of [formula] have a maximum of one block and one section is a free section. We have, [formula] [formula]. Now what we are having is two sets [formula] and H2n have the same definition and the same number of elements in the underlying sets, hence must be of the same size. That is, [formula]. Thus the lemma.

The case m = 2 differs from the above two cases in the sense that a non-trivial constant term arises in the form of 2n. Therefore we state and prove for the value m = 2, the following lemma,

for m = 2 and [formula] we have,

2I2n - 2n = I3n

We consider a set H2n, which is the set of all barred preferential arrangements of an n element set having 2 bars, in which the first 2 sections have a maximum of one block each and the 3rd section to be just a preferential arrangement of given elements not necessarily into one block( this is the only section with this property). So the 3rd section of each element of H2n is the free section. We also consider the set H3n, which is the set of all barred preferential arrangements of an n element set, having 3 bars in which 3 fixed sections have a maximum of one block each and one section can have more than one block( the free section).

We now want to reconstruct H3n using elements of H2n. Adding an extra bar [formula] to the far right of each element of H2n does not affect counting. We do that to form the set *  ¶2n. Now we have | * ¶2n| = I2n = |H2n|. Where the bar [formula] is to the right of the free sections of elements of H2n. On each element [formula] to the left of the bar [formula] is the free section of [formula] and the section to the right of [formula] is empty. We define the set R*n(2) = {0,1}  ×    *  ¶2n as containing the same elements as *  ¶2n but with an indexing on the bar [formula] which is either 0 or 1, hence R*n(2) has twice the number of elements as *  ¶2n(of which half of them having the indexing 0 and the other half having the index 1). We now use elements of R*n(2) to reconstruct the set H3n. We construct as follows, .If the indexing on the bar [formula] on an element [formula] is 0 then such an element will be interpreted in H8n, as an element of H3n whose 4th section is empty. We collect all such elements to form the set W. The set W has I2n elements(half of the elements in R*n(2) have the indexing 0) If the indexing on the bar [formula] on an element [formula] is 1 then we shift the last block of the 3rd section of [formula] to be the only block to the right of [formula](i.e the block closest to the bar [formula] on [formula]) to form the set K. There are I2n elements having index 1 in R*n(2)(half of the elements in R*n(2) have the indexing 1). On the construct of the set K some elements of K also appear as elements of the set W. Those redundant elements occur when there free section on elements of R*n(2) is empty. In that case there is no block to put to the right of the bar [formula] when constructing the set K. In that case we get common elements between K and W. Common elements between K and W occur when the n elements are distributed on the first m sections of H2n of which there are 2n ways of doing that. So the number of elements in the intersection of K and W is 2n.

The elements both sets K and W have 4 sections. Of which for a fixed [formula], 3 sections of [formula] have a maximum of one block and one section is a free section. We have, [formula] [formula]. Now what we are having is two sets [formula] and H3n have the same definition and the same number of elements in the underlying sets, So they must be of the same size. Hence [formula]. Thus the lemma.

We generalise lemmas [\ref=lemma:2],[\ref=lemma:3] and [\ref=lemma:4] into the following theorem,

for [formula], we have

2Imn - mn  =  Im + 1n

We consider a set Hmn, which is the set of all barred preferential arrangements of an n element set having m bars, in which the first m sections have a maximum of one block each and the (m  +  1)th section to be just a preferential arrangement of given elements not necessarily into one block( this is the only section with this property). So the (m  +  1)th section of each element of Hmn is the free section. We also consider the set Hm + 1n, which is the set of all barred preferential arrangements of an n element set, having m + 1 bars in which m + 1 fixed sections have a maximum of one block each and one section can have more than one block(the free section).

We now want to reconstruct Hm + 1n using elements of Hmn. Adding an extra bar [formula] to the far right of each element of Hmn does not affect counting. We do that to form the set *  ¶mn. Now we have | * ¶mn| = Imn = |Hmn|. Where the bar [formula] is to the right of the free sections of elements of Hmn. On each element [formula] to the left of the bar [formula] is the free section of [formula] and the section to the right of [formula] is empty. We define the set R*n(m) = {0,1}  ×    *  ¶mn as containing the same elements as *  ¶mn but with an indexing on the bar [formula] which is either 0 or 1, hence R*n(m) has twice the number of elements as *  ¶mn(of which half of them having the indexing 0 and the other half having the index 1). We now use elements of R*n(m) to reconstruct the set Hm + 1n. We construct as follows, .If the indexing on the bar [formula] on an element [formula] is 0 then such an element will be interpreted in Hm + 1n, as an element of Hm + 1n whose (m  +  2)th section is empty. We collect all such elements to form the set W. The set W has Imn elements(half of the elements in R*n(m) have the indexing 0) If the indexing on the bar [formula] on an element [formula] is 1 then we shift the last block of the (m  +  1)th section of [formula] to be the only block to the right of [formula](i.e the block closest to the bar [formula] on [formula]) to form the set K. There are Imn elements having index 1 in R*n(m)(half of the elements in R*n(m) have the indexing 1). On the construct of the set K some elements of K also appear as elements of the set W. Those redundant elements occur when there free section on elements of R*n(m) is empty. In that case there is no block to put to the right of the bar [formula] when constructing the set K. In that case we get common elements between K and W. Common elements between K and W occur when the n elements are distributed on the first m sections of Hmn of which there are mn ways of doing that. So the number of elements in the intersection of K and W is mn.

The elements both sets K and W have m + 2 sections. Of which for a fixed [formula], m + 1 sections of [formula] have a maximum of one block and one section is a free section. We have, [formula] [formula]. Now what we are having is two sets [formula] and Hm + 1n have the same definition and the same number of elements in the underlying sets, So they must be of the same size. Hence [formula]. Thus the theorem.
