Introduction

The extended Hubbard model has been studied extensively to understand phenomena such as charge density wave, spin density wave and unconventional superconductivity which can not be described by the Hubbard model consisting of the electron hopping and the on-site interaction [\cite=Hirsch93] [\cite=JK99] [\cite=TML07]. The Hamiltonian of the model is obtained by adding interaction terms of electrons on different sites to the Hubbard Hamiltonian. In the case where the added interaction together with the on-site one is dominant and is known to induce a certain ordering state with an energy gap, the model is well understood by considering the electron hopping as a perturbation. On the other hand, in order to understand phenomena which do not arise directly from interactions, we have to face the difficult problem of analyzing the interplay between the electron hopping and some interactions in a convincing way. The unconventional superconductivity corresponds to such a case.

Here we restrict ourselves to the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model with nearest neighbour interactions. Despite the difficulty in analyzing correlated electron systems, there are a few rigorous results associated with superconductivity in this case. Most of these results are obtained through the Bethe ansatz method, and the superconducting ground states so far obtained are related to spin-singlet electron pair condensation [\cite=EKS92] [\cite=AA94] [\cite=DM01]. In this paper we provide another rigorous result for the model. By using a similar method in Ref. [\cite=Tanaka08], we will show that the model exhibits saturated ferromagnetic, spin-triplet electron pair condensation in the ground state over a certain range of interaction parameters.

It is worth noting that in the last decade the Majorana edge state formed on a spinless superconducting wire has attracted much interest both theoretically and experimentally [\cite=Kitaev01] [\cite=Fendley12] [\cite=LSS10] [\cite=Alicea11] [\cite=Mourik12] [\cite=Lee14] [\cite=Nadj14]. Our model exhibits saturated ferromagnetism where the electrons behave as spinless fermions. We show that a similar edge state is formed in the gauge symmetry breaking ground state of our model.

Definition of the model and the main result

We consider a one-dimensional array of L sites, which are labeled as [formula]. We write Λ for the set of numbers [formula] and identify Λ with the array of L sites. We also write Λ̄ for [formula]. In this paper L is assumed to be an odd integer with [formula]. This condition is adopted only for simplicity, and similar results for even L are obtained with minor changes.

Let [formula] be the annihilation(creation) operator of an electron at site x∈Λ and with spin [formula]. They satisfy the anticommutation relations,

[formula]

and

[formula]

for any sites x,y and any [formula]. For each site x, we define the number operators [formula] and [formula], and the spin operators [formula] with l = 1,2,3, where p(l)σ,τ are the elements of the Pauli matrices

[formula]

For each nearest neighbour pair of sites x and x + 1, we define local Hamiltonian Hx by

[formula]

where

[formula]

The term Ht,x represents electron hopping, and HU,x,HV,x,HJ,x and HX,x represent electron-electron interactions, usually referred to as the on-site, the charge-charge, the spin-spin and the bond-charge interactions, respectively. In this paper, we assume 0 < 2t  ≤  V and define parameter δ ranging from 0 to π / 2 by

[formula]

We then consider the Hamiltonian given by

[formula]

on Λ with open boundary conditions.

Before stating our main result, we have to introduce some more notations. Let us define ã operators by

[formula]

where

[formula]

By using ã operators, we define pair operators [formula] with [formula] by

[formula]

where [formula] is given by

[formula]

It is noted that [formula].

We denote by Φ0 the state with no electrons on Λ. The total number of electrons on Λ is denoted by [formula]. We assume [formula] and define the number [formula] of electron pairs by

[formula]

With the values of the parameters given by

[formula]

our main result is summarized as follows:

Suppose that both U > U0 and J  ≥  J0 are satisfied. Then, the ground state energy of H with

[formula]

and

[formula]

is zero for [formula]. The ground state is unique apart from the degeneracy due to the spin-rotation symmetry, and is given by

[formula]

and its SU(2) rotations.

Proof

Proof of Proposition [\ref=proposition]. In the following, conditions ([\ref=eq:condition_X]) and ([\ref=eq:condition_mu]) are assumed to be satisfied and [formula] is fixed.

Firstly we will show that the Hamiltonian H can be expressed as a sum of positive semi-definite operators. We define a operators by

[formula]

for x∈Λ̄ and

[formula]

We also define b operators by

[formula]

for x∈Λ̄ and

[formula]

By using a and b operators we define

[formula]

It is noted that Hx,0 is positive semi-definite. Then, after a lengthy but straightforward calculation, one finds that Hx is rewritten as

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] are, respectively, defined by ([\ref=eq:on-site]) and ([\ref=eq:spin-spin]) with U and J replaced by [formula] and [formula], and HW,x is defined by

[formula]

with W = U0 / 2. For U  ≥  U0 and J  ≥  J0, all the terms in the right hand side of ([\ref=eq:rewritten_H_x]) are positive semi-definite. This proves that H is the sum of the positive semi-definite operators for [formula]. Therefore, a zero energy state of H, if it exists, is a ground state.

Secondly, we will show that [formula] is a zero energy state of all the terms in ([\ref=eq:rewritten_H_x]) for any x∈Λ̄.

Note that ã operators form a basis for fermion operators on Λ, since [formula] for x,y∈Λ by our definition. So we expand bx,σ with x∈Λ in terms of ãx,σ as [formula]. It is easy to see that [formula], which gives us

[formula]

From this expression of b operators we obtain

[formula]

Since [formula], ([\ref=eq:a_zeta]) implies that [formula] commutes with [formula] for x∈Λ̄. The creation operator [formula] anticommutes with [formula], i.e, it also commutes with [formula] for x∈Λ̄. Therefore, we have [formula]. This together with the fact that there is no creation operator with the [formula]-spin in [formula] leads to [formula] for any x∈Λ̄. This proves that [formula] is a zero energy state of H.

Here we shall check that [formula] is not the null state. It follows from ([\ref=eq:a_zeta]) that

[formula]

Hence we have

[formula]

for even [formula] and

[formula]

for odd [formula], where Const. is a certain non-zero constant number. The right hand sides of ([\ref=eq:not_null_for_even]) and ([\ref=eq:not_null_for_odd]) are apparently not zero, which implies [formula].

Finally we shall show the uniqueness of the zero energy state.

Let M be the eigenvalue of the third component of the total spin. Since the Hamiltonian H has the spin-rotation symmetry, it is convenient to decompose the Hilbert space H of states into the subspaces HM each of which has the fixed eigenvalue M. Let ΦM be a lowest-energy state in HM. Since the representative of [formula] in HM is also a zero energy state of H, the lowest energy in HM is guaranteed to be zero. This implies that ΦM must satisfy HxΦM = 0 for x∈Λ̄. In particular, for U > U0, [formula] must be zero for any x∈Λ. Now we represent ΦM by using the c operators. As mentioned above, since each site is forbidden to be doubly occupied by electrons in ΦM, it can be expanded in terms of normalized basis states in the form

[formula]

where A is a subset of Λ with [formula], [formula], and [formula]. In the product, c operators are ordered in such a way that the site indexes x increase from left to right.

Let us consider the matrix representation [formula] of the Hamiltonian H with respect to the basis states in the form ([\ref=eq:basis]). We assume that the basis states are ordered in an arbitrary manner and denote by [formula] the matrix element corresponding to i-th and j-th basis states. Then one easily finds that any non-zero off-diagonal matrix element is - t or - J / 2, which is negative. It is also easy to see that for any i,j there is a sequence [formula] such that [formula]. Therefore it follows from the Perron-Frobenius theorem that the lowest energy state of [formula] is unique [\cite=Tasaki98], which implies that the lowest energy state of H in HM is also unique and is given by the representative of [formula] in HM. This completes the proof of Proposition [\ref=proposition].

Ground states with broken spin-rotation and gauge symmetries

In this section, we assume that the parameters U,J,Xx and μx satisfy the conditions in Proposition [\ref=proposition], and hence the ground states of H with the fixed electron number are given by ([\ref=eq:ground_states]) and its SU(2) rotations. Since the ground states are saturated ferromagnetic, we furthermore assume that the third component of the total spin is fixed to [formula]. Under these assumptions, we introduce two gauge-symmetry-breaking zero energy states, each of which is transferred to the other by applying edge operators.

In the following, since all the electrons are assumed to have the [formula]-spin, we omit the spin indexes in the fermion operators for notational simplicity. We define the zero energy states with the broken gauge symmetry

[formula]

and

[formula]

where η is a positive parameter and θ is a phase parameter. The state [formula] is a superposition of the zero energy states of H with even(odd) numbers of electrons. The states [formula] and [formula] have the different fermionic parities, and, as we shall see in the next section, these states are stabilized by superconducting pairing fields.

As usual, let us define the Majorana fermion operators

[formula]

which satisfy [formula] and {γα,x,γβ,y} = 2δα,βδx,y for any α,β∈{A,B} and x,y∈Λ. By using γα,1 and γα,L with α = A,B, we introduce new edge operators as

[formula]

(Recall that w1  =   sin (δ / 2) and w2  =   cos (δ / 2).) The edge operators Γ1 and ΓL are rewritten as

[formula]

with the c operators. Then, we find that

[formula]

Furthermore, from the above relations, we obtain

[formula]

The relations ([\ref=eq:Gamma1PhiG0]) and ([\ref=eq:Gamma1PhiG1]) are obtained as follows. For x∈Λ we have from ([\ref=eq:a_zeta]) that

[formula]

which yields

[formula]

Here we used [formula] [\cite=comment1]. By ([\ref=eq:aPhiGe]), we also have

[formula]

By representing ([\ref=eq:aPhiGe]) and ([\ref=eq:aPhiGo]) with the c operators and setting x = L, one finds

[formula]

with l = 0,1. On the other hand, ([\ref=eq:aPhiGe]) and ([\ref=eq:aPhiGo]) combined with

[formula]

which follow from the definition, yield

[formula]

with l = 0,1. From ([\ref=eq:edge1]) and ([\ref=eq:edge2]) we obtain ([\ref=eq:Gamma1PhiG0]), and ([\ref=eq:Gamma1PhiG1]).

It is noted that in the case η = w2 / w1 = 1 /  tan (δ / 2) we have Γ1  =  γA,1 and ΓL  =  γB,L which are the Majorana fermion operators. In this case, we can reconstruct the edge fermion operator by combining γA,1 and γB,L as

[formula]

The fermion operator [formula] satisfies [formula] and [formula]. We also have from ([\ref=eq:Gamma1PhiG0]) and ([\ref=eq:Gamma1PhiG1]) that

[formula]

The above relations imply that the Majorana edge state is formed at the ends of the chain.

Mean field Hamiltonian

In this section we consider external fields (or mean fields) which remove the ground state degeneracy and select [formula] and [formula] as the ground states. It is well known that the external magnetic field can remove the degeneracy due to the spin-rotation symmetry but it preserves the gauge symmetry. Here we shall consider the Hamiltonian which does not conserve the electron number.

The spin indexes are still omitted in this and the next sections with the assumption that the system is in a magnetic field.

Let us define

[formula]

where α and |Δ| are non-negative parameters. As we will see below, [formula] corresponds to the superconducting pairing field. Since [formula] for x∈Λ̄, we have

[formula]

and hence, for α  ≥  0, [formula] is a positive semi-definite operator. From ([\ref=eq:aPhiGe]) and ([\ref=eq:aPhiGo]) we find that [formula] and [formula] are zero energy states of [formula] for x∈Λ̄. Therefore [formula] and [formula] are ground states of [formula]. It is easy to see that there is no other ground state. The Hamiltonian [formula] can remove the ground state degeneracy of H and can stabilize the states [formula] and [formula].

After some lengthy but straightforward calculations, [formula] is rewritten as

[formula]

with

[formula]

From the above representation of [formula], one immediately realizes that Δ corresponds to the superconducting pairing field, which may be induced from a nearby superconductor. This field term essentially removes the degeneracy. It is noted that, in the case where δ  =  π / 2, η = 1 and α = 1, [formula] is reduced to the Hamiltonian of the Kitaev chain of the spin-less fermions in the topological phase. Thus our model can be also regarded as an extension of the Kitaev chain to the spin-full system with the electron-electron interactions.

Electron number conserving case

In the previous two sections we consider the case where the number of electrons is not conserved. From the expressions ([\ref=eq:PhiGe]) and ([\ref=eq:PhiGo]) of the symmetry breaking ground states, we find that the edge state is closely related to the zero energy mode corresponding to [formula]. Here, within the electron number conserving setting, we propose an example of a system having the two-fold degenerate ground states each of which is characterized by this zero energy mode.

Firstly we prepare a copy of H. The operators in the copied system are denoted by the underline as x. We then consider the Hamiltonian H +  + Hε on the two chains, where

[formula]

with ε > 0 is a interchain interaction. The number of electrons on the system is fixed to [formula]. For this system one easily finds that the two states

[formula]

for odd [formula], and

[formula]

for even [formula] are the only ground states. In fact, H, [formula] and Hε are positive semi-definite, and [formula] and [formula] are the only zero energy states for these Hamiltonians.

We remark that the fermion operator defined by [formula] plays an interesting role in manipulating the zero energy mode in the condensate. More precisely, aπ satisfies [formula] since [formula] and [formula]. Therefore, we have the relations [formula], [formula] and [formula] for the symmetry breaking ground states. Similar relations are also found for the electron number conserving system. Namely, we have [formula], [formula] and [formula] for odd [formula], and [formula] and [formula] for even [formula].

Spin-Spin Interaction with Ising-like Anisotropy

In this section, we treat the case of the spin-spin interaction with an Ising-like anisotropy.

Let us define

[formula]

where β is a non-negative parameter and denote by HJ,β,x the Hamiltonian obtained by replacing [formula] with [formula] in HJ,x. Then we consider the Hamiltonian

[formula]

Note that the bond-charge interaction HX,x is omitted in Hβ,x. For Hβ, we have the following result:

Suppose that both U > U0 + 2X0 and J > J0 + 4X0 are satisfied. We furthermore suppose that μx is given by ([\ref=eq:condition_mu]). Then, the ground state energy of H with

[formula]

is zero. The ground state is two-fold degenerate and is given by

[formula]

with [formula].

The outline of the proof is as follows. As in the isotropic spin-spin interaction case, we rewrite Hβ,x as

[formula]

where HX0,x is given by

[formula]

[formula] is obtained by replacing U with [formula] in HU,x, and [formula] is obtained by replacing J and β with [formula] and [formula], respectively, in HJ,β,x. When [formula] and [formula], all the terms in () are positive semi-definite and [formula] in ([\ref=eq:ground_states_with_anisotropy]) is their zero energy state. The fact that there is no other zero energy state follows from the application of the Perron-Frobenius theorem.

In the case of the isotropic spin-spin interaction, the bond-charge interaction whose strength parameter is fixed must be included in the Hamiltonian to obtain the exact ground states. On the other hand, the Hamiltonian with the anisotropic spin-spin interaction has the exact ground states even if the bond-charge interaction is absent. Although the on-site potentials still have to be adjusted to certain values, the model with the anisotropic spin-spin interaction exhibits the spin-triplet electron pair condensation over the wide range of parameters.

Conclusion

We have introduced the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model whose ground state simultaneously exhibits saturated ferromagnetism and spin-triplet electron pair condensation under certain conditions. Recently, the extended Hubbard chain with charge-charge and spin-spin interactions at low filling has been studied by means of mean field and numerical methods in Ref. [\cite=SCHW14]. The results have shown that the ground state is in the spin-triplet pairing phase for strong ferromagnetic coupling, even if there are no fine-tuned bond-charge interactions and on-site potentials which are necessary to get our exact results. These results together with ours indicate that the model exhibits spin-triplet pairing over a wide range of parameters. We have constructed two ground states in which both of the spin-rotation symmetry and the gauge symmetry are broken. It has been shown that these ground states are transferred from one to the other by applying the edge operators. The edge operators become the Majorana fermions in a certain case, and, in this sense, the Majorana state is formed on the edges of a chain in our model. We have introduced the mean field Hamiltonian with the pairing field which stabilizes the gauge symmetry breaking ground states. Here we remark that the spin-triplet pair condensation found in the ground state of H is unstable against the thermal fluctuation since H is constituted of short-range interactions and is defined on a chain. However we can expect that the spin-triplet pair condensate survives at non-zero temperatures in the strong pairing field. The mean field Hamiltonian is shown to be regarded as the Kitaev chain with the nearest neighbour charge-charge interaction. It is noted that a similar spinless fermion model has been studied by Katsura, Schuricht, and Takahashi recently [\cite=TSK15]. Our extended Hubbard model together with the mean field is an extension of the Kitaev chain to the spin-full electron model. We have also treated the model on the two chains in the electron number conserving setting. It has been shown that the system has the two-fold degenerate ground states.

To conclude, it is interesting to note that Nadj-Perge et al. have reported the observation of Majorana fermions in a chain of Fe atoms, which intrinsically have ferromagnetic nature, on a superconducting Pb substrate [\cite=Lee14] [\cite=Nadj14]. It is also noted that the recent developments in the field of cold atoms open a route to the experimental realization of one-dimensional interacting fermion systems [\cite=Guan13]. We hope that our results stimulate these fields.
