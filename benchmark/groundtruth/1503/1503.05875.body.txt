Round fold maps on manifolds regarded as the total spaces of linear and more general bundles

Introduction

Fold maps are fundamental tools in studying a generalization of the theory of Morse functions and its application to geometry of manifolds.

A fold map is defined as a smooth map such that each singular point is of the form

[formula]

for two positive integers m  ≥  n and an integer 0  ≤  i  ≤  m - n + 1 and a Morse function is regarded as a fold map, for example. For a fold map from a closed smooth manifold of dimension m into a smooth manifold of dimension n without boundary, the following two hold.

The set of all the singular points (the singular set) is a closed smooth submanifold of dimension n - 1 of the source manifold.

The restriction map to the singular set is an immersion of codimension 1.

We also note that if the restriction map to the singular set is an immersion with normal crossings, then it is stable (stable maps are important in the theory of global singularity; see [\cite=golubitskyguillemin] for example).

Constructions of explicit fold maps will help us to study smooth manifolds by using the theory of fold maps which are easy to handle and it is very difficult to construct explicit fold maps in general, although existence problems for fold maps have been solved under various conditions. However, such fold maps with good properties were constructed as we will introduce the following.

In [\cite=burletderham], [\cite=furuyaporto], [\cite=saeki2], [\cite=saekisakuma] and [\cite=sakuma], special generic maps, which are fold maps whose singular points are of the form

[formula]

for two positive integers m  ≥  n, were studied. Special generic maps are not so difficult to construct. They were constructed by constructing local C∞ maps on manifolds with boundaries and gluing them together. For example, by such methods, some special generic maps on homotopy spheres including standard spheres are obtained. Furthermore, manifolds admitting special generic maps were classified under restrictions on the dimensions of source and target manifolds and the fundamental groups of source manifolds.

Later, in [\cite=kitazawa] and [\cite=kitazawa2] the author introduced round fold maps, which will be mainly studied in this paper. A round fold map is defined as a fold map satisfying the following three.

The singular set is a disjoint union of standard spheres.

The restriction to the singular set is an embedding.

The set of all the singular values is a disjoint union of spheres embedded concentrically.

For example, some special generic maps on homotopy spheres are round fold maps whose singular sets are connected (see Example [\ref=ex:1] ([\ref=ex:1.1]) later and also [\cite=saeki2]).

In [\cite=kitazawa2], homology groups and homotopy groups of manifolds admitting round fold maps were studied. Some examples of round fold maps and the diffeomorphism types of their source manifolds were given by the author in [\cite=kitazawa], [\cite=kitazawa3], [\cite=kitazawa4] and [\cite=kitazawa5]. For example, we have obtained round fold maps on manifolds admitting bundle structures over the n-dimensional (n  ≥  2) standard sphere and manifolds represented as connected sums of manifolds admitting bundle structures over the n-dimensional (n  ≥  2) standard sphere whose fibers are diffemorphic to the (m - n)-dimensional standard sphere Sm - n (m > n). In [\cite=kitazawa4] and [\cite=kitazawa5], as new answers, we have obtained new round fold maps on closed manifolds admitting bundle structures over (exotic) homotopy spheres or ones over more general manifolds.

In the last two papers, as a useful tool to construct new round fold maps, a P-operation has been introduced. Especially, in these papers, a lot of round fold maps from manifolds having bundle structures such that the fibers are circles were obtained. In this paper, as a generalized work of [\cite=kitazawa4] and [\cite=kitazawa5], we apply P-operations to construct more explicit round fold maps on manifolds having bundle structures such that the structure groups are linear and act on the fibers smoothly. This paper is organized as the following.

In section [\ref=sec:2], we recall round fold maps and some terminologies on round fold maps such as axes and proper cores. We also recall a C∞ trivial round fold map. We introduce results on the diffeomorphism types of manifolds admitting C∞ trivial round fold maps shown by the author in [\cite=kitazawa] and [\cite=kitazawa3].

In section [\ref=sec:3], we recall a locally C∞ trivial round fold map, which is a round fold map satisfying a kind of triviality around the connected components of the set of singular values. We recall P-operations defined in [\cite=kitazawa4], which are operations used to construct new round fold maps on manifolds having the structures of manifolds admitting bundle structures over manifolds admitting locally C∞ trivial round fold maps. More preisely, a P-operation consists of four steps; we decompose the given round fold map, confirm that the restrictions of the bundle over the given manifold to the obtained pieces of the source manifold of the round fold map are trivial, construct maps on these pieces and glue these maps together. A construction of a round fold map by a P-operation requires us that the bundle is not so complex.

In section [\ref=sec:4], as main works of the present paper, we apply P-operations to construct new round fold maps on manifolds regarded as the total spaces of bundles whose fibers are closed smooth manifolds and whose structure groups are linear and act on the fibers smoothly (linear bundles) and more general bundles over manifolds admitting locally C∞ trivial round fold maps. These works are regarded as extensions of works [\cite=kitazawa3] and [\cite=kitazawa5] by the author. In these works, we mainly consider bundles whose fibers are circles and we have obtained a lot of new round fold maps and manifolds. In these works, the theory of the classification of circle bundles, which is the most fundamental part of the theory of characteristic classes of vector bundles discussed in [\cite=milnorstasheff]. In the present paper, we consider some appropriate situations and obtain new round fold maps and their source manifolds through Theorems [\ref=thm:1]-[\ref=thm:8] with Examples [\ref=ex:2]-[\ref=ex:8]. For such general studies, as an essential tool, we use more general theory of characteristic classes of linear bundles of [\cite=milnorstasheff].

Throughout this paper, manifolds and maps between manifolds are smooth and of class C∞ unless otherwise stated. The base spaces and fibers of bundles in this paper are smooth manifolds and the structure groups of the bundles act on the fibers smoothly unless otherwise stated.

Moreover, let M be a closed (smooth) manifold of dimension m, let N be a (smooth) manifold of dimension n with no boundary, let f:M  →  N be a (smooth) map and let m  ≥  n  ≥  1. We denote the singular set of f, which is defined as the set consisting of all the singular points of f, by S(f). We call the set f(S(f)) the singular value set of f. We call an inverse image f- 1(p)∈M a fiber of f and if the point p∈N is a regular value of f, then we call it a regular fiber of f.

Round fold maps

In this section, we review round fold maps. See also [\cite=kitazawa2].

Terminologies on round fold maps

[formula] (m  ≥  n  ≥  2) is said to be a round fold map if f is C∞ equivalent to a fold map [formula] on a closed C∞ manifold M0 such that the following three hold.

The singular set S(f0) is a disjoint union of (n - 1)-dimensional standard spheres and consists of [formula] connected components.

The restriction map f0|S(f0) is an embedding.

Let [formula]. Then the set f0(S(f0)) is represented as the disjoint union [formula].

We call f0 a normal form of f. We call a ray L from [formula] an axis of f0 and [formula] the proper core of f0. Suppose that for a round fold map f, its normal form f0 and diffeomorphisms Φ:M  →  M0 and [formula], [formula]. Then for an axis L of f0, we also call φ- 1(L) an axis of f and for the proper core [formula] of f0, we also call [formula] a proper core of f.

Let [formula] be a round fold map,let P be a proper core of f and let L be an axis of the map f. Then, [formula] has a bundle structure over ∂P such that the fiber is diffeomorphic to the manifold f- 1(L) and that f|f- 1(∂P):f- 1(∂P)  →  ∂P defines a subbundle of the previous bundle [formula]. In this situation, we can define a C∞ trivial round fold map.

In this situation, a round fold map f is said to be C∞ trivial if we can take the bundle [formula] as a trivial bundle.

We introduce some known examples of round fold maps with their source manifolds.

Locally C∞ trivial round fold maps and P-operations

We recall locally C∞ trivial round fold maps and P-operations. See also [\cite=kitazawa3] and [\cite=kitazawa5].

Let [formula] be a round fold map. Assume that for any connected component C of f(S(f)) and a small closed tubular neighborhood N(C) of C such that ∂N(C) is the disjoint union of two connected components C1 and C2, f- 1(N(C)) has the structure of a trivial bundle over C1 or C2 and f|f- 1(C1):f- 1(C1)  →  C1 and f|f- 1(C2):f- 1(C2)  →  C2 give the structures of subbundles of the bundle f- 1(N(C)). Then f is said to be locally C∞ trivial. We call the fiber FC of the bundle f- 1(N(C)) the normal fiber of C corresponding to the bundle f- 1(N(C)). Assume that C1 is in the bounded connected component of [formula] and we denote the fiber of the subbundle f- 1(C1) by ∂0FC.

Maps in Example [\ref=ex:1] ([\ref=ex:1.1]) are locally C∞ trivial. Ones in Example [\ref=ex:1] ([\ref=ex:1.2]) are constructed as locally C∞ trivial maps in [\cite=kitazawa] and [\cite=kitazawa4]. We can construct maps on the product of the (n - 1)-dimensional standard sphere and a homotopy sphere explained in the last part of Example [\ref=ex:1] ([\ref=ex:1.3]) as locally C∞ trivial maps.

We can construct a locally C∞ trivial round fold map in the following method. We use the method in the proof of Proposition [\ref=prop:2] and other scenes of the present paper.

Let [formula]. Let [formula] be a family of compact manifold of dimension m - n + 1 such that the boudary of Ej is a disjoint union of two closed manifolds Fj and Fj + 1, that [formula] is empty and that except F0 and [formula], all the manifolds in the family {Fj} are non-empty. There exist a positive integer l and a sequence of integers [formula] of integers such that k1 = 1 and [formula] hold and that the inequality kj < kj + 1 holds for any integer [formula]. We can construct a Morse function :Ej  →  [null] satisfying the following three.

For any integer [formula], On Fj, [formula] is constant and minimal if Fj is non-emppty and on Fj + 1, [formula] is constant and maximal if Fj + 1 is non-empty.

The minimum of [formula] is [formula] if Fj is non-empty. If Fj is empty, then by the assumption, j = 1 holds and in this case, the minimum of [formula] is 1. The maximum of [formula] is [formula] if [formula] holds and an integer l larger than [formula] if [formula] holds. respectively. The image (IntEj) of the interior IntEj of Ej is the open interval [formula].

Singular points of [formula] are always in the interior IntEj of Ej and at distinct singular points, the values are always distinct. Furthermore, the set of all the singular values consists of all the integers larger than [formula] and smaller than [formula] if [formula] holds and all the integers larger than [formula] and not larger than l if [formula] holds.

We obtain a family of maps [formula].

If F1 is non-empty, then by gluing the family of maps and the projection [formula] together properly, we obtain a desired round fold map; for a non-negative real number t, we regard {t}  ×  Sn - 1 as ∂Dnt by identifying (t,x)∈{t}  ×  Sn - 1 with [formula]. If F1 is empty, then by gluing the family [formula] of maps, we obtain a desired round fold map similarly.

We call such a construction a locally trivial spinning construction.

The following proposition has been shown in [\cite=kitazawa] and also in [\cite=kitazawa4].

We introduce the proof of this first performed in [\cite=kitazawa3]. In the proof of this proposition, we use the notation [formula] appearing in Definition [\ref=def:1].

We only prove the proposition in the case where f is locally C∞ trivial, since we can similarly prove this in the case where f is C∞ trivial. We assume that f(M) is diffeomorphic to Dn and we can prove the theorem similarly if f(M) is not diffeomorphic to Dn.

We may assume that [formula] is a normal form. Let S(f) consist of l connected components. Set [formula] and [formula] for an integer 1  ≤  k  ≤  l. Then f- 1(Pk) is regarded as the total space of a trivial bundle over [formula] or [formula] such that the fibers are diffeomorphic to a compact manifold, which we denote by Ek and that the submersions [formula] and [formula] make the submanifolds subbundles of the bundle f- 1(Pk); we denote the fibers of these two subbundles by Ek1  ⊂  Ek and Ek2  ⊂  Ek, respectively. For any integer 1  ≤  k  ≤  l and a diffeomorphism φk from [formula] onto [formula] regarded as a bundle isomorphism between the two trivial bundles over standard spheres inducing the identification between the base spaces, M is regarded as [formula] and for any integer 1  ≤  k  ≤  l and a diffeomorphism Φk from [formula] onto [formula] regarded as a bundle isomorphism between the two trivial F-bundles inducing φk, [formula] is regarded as [formula]. We construct a map on f- 1(Pk)  ×  F. This manifold is regarded as the total space of a trivial bundle over [formula] or [formula] such that the fibers are diffeomorphic to Ek  ×  F. On Ek  ×  F there exists a Morse function [formula] such that the following four hold.

(Ek  ×  F)  ⊂  [null] and [formula] hold.

[formula] holds if Ek1  ×  F is non-empty.

[formula] holds if Ek2  ×  F is non-empty.

Singular points of [formula] are in the interior of Ek  ×  F and at two distinct singular points, the values are always distinct.

We obtain a map idSn - 1  ×  :Sn - 1  ×  Ek  ×  F  →  Sn - 1  ×  [null]. We can identify Sn - 1  ×  [null] with [formula] by identifying (p,t)∈Sn - 1  ×  [null] with tp∈Pk where we regard Sn - 1 as the unit sphere of dimension n - 1. By gluing the composition of the projection from [formula] onto [formula] and [formula] and the family {idSn - 1  ×  } together by using the family {Φk} and the family of identifications in the target manifold [formula], we obtain a new round fold map [formula].

In the proof, from a given map [formula], we obtain a new map [formula]. We call the operation of constructing [formula] from f a P-operation by F to the map f. For example, if f is a map presented in Example [\ref=ex:1] ([\ref=ex:1.1]), then on any manifold having the bundle structure over the source homotopy sphere, we can construct a (locally) C∞ trivial round fold map by a P-operation to the map f.

Constructions of round fold maps on manifolds regarded as linear bundles by P-operations

In this paper, we denote the k-th orthogonal group by O(k) and the k-th special orthogonal group by SO(k). In this paper, a bundle is said to be linear if the structure group is a subgroup of an orthogonal group. A linear bundle is said to be orientable if the structure group is reduced to a subgroup of a special orthogonal group and we obtain two oriented linear bundles naturally.

We recall known fundamental terms and facts on linear bundles.

For any linear bundle, we can consider its k-th Stiefel-Whitney class, which is a k-th cohomology class of the base space whose coefficient ring is [formula]. For any oriented linear bundle whose structure group is SO(k), we can consider its Euler class, which is a k-th cohomology class of the base space whose coefficient ring is [formula]. We introduce known facts on classifications of linear bundles without proofs.

In this section, we define a spin bundle as an orientable linear bundle such that the 2nd Stiefel-Whitney class vanishes as in Proposition [\ref=prop:3] ([\ref=prop:3.4]).

k-dimensional real (complex) vector bundles are regarded as linear bundles whose structure groups are the groups of all the linear transformations on the fibers. In this paper, we only consider real vector bundles. We also note that the structure groups of k-dimensional real vector bundles are regarded as the groups of all the orthgonal transformations on the k-dimensional vector spaces and naturally as O(k).

Any Sk-bundle whose structure group consists of linear transformations on the fiber Sk is regarded as a linear bundle whose structure group is the group of all the transformations given by the restrictions of orthgonal transformations on [formula] considering Sk as the unit sphere and as a result O(k + 1). It is naturally a subbundle of an associated real vector bundle whose fiber is a (k + 1)-dimensional real vector space. We call such a linear bundle a standard linear bundle. For k = 1,2,3, any Sk-bundle is regarded as a standard linear bundle whose structure group is O(k + 1) (see [\cite=smale] for the case k = 2 and [\cite=hatcher] for the case k = 3).

First, we review some topological properties of the total spaces of such bundles. For a k-dimensional manifold X, let us denote by TX the total space of the tangent bundle of X, which is an important k-dimensional real vector bundle over X and for k  ≥  2, let us denote the total space of the unit tangent bundle of X by UTX, which is obtained as the subbundle of the bundle TX whose fiber is the unit sphere [formula]. A manifold is said to be spin if its tangent bundle is spin.

Also, the following Proposition [\ref=prop:4] is useful.

For the theory of linear bundles and their characteristic classes including Stiefel-Whitney classes and Euler classes, see also [\cite=milnorstasheff] for example.

In [\cite=kitazawa5], we have constructed a lot of explicit round fold maps on manifolds regarded as the total spaces of S1-bundles over a manifold admitting a locally C∞ trivial round fold map by using P-operations. In this section, we apply P-operations to locally C∞ trivial round fold maps to construct new round fold maps on manifolds regarded as the total spaces of linear bundles and more general bundles over the original source manifolds.

Cases for round fold maps between low-dimensional manifolds

First we show the following theorem, which gives more round fold maps and their source manifolds.

By virtue of Proposition [\ref=prop:2], to prove the statements, it suffices to show that for any connected component C of the singular value set f(S(f)) and a small closed tubular neighborhood N(C) as in Definition [\ref=def:3], the restriction of the bundle [formula] over M to f- 1(N(C)) is trivial. Note that f- 1(N(C)) is regarded as a trivial bundle whose fiber is FC as menitioned in Definition [\ref=def:3]. Note also that FC is regarded as an (m - n + 1)-dimensional CW-complex simple homotopy equivalent to an (m - n)-dimensional CW-complex and that f- 1(N(C)) is regarded as an m-dimenisonal CW-complex simple homotopy equivalent to the product of Sn - 1 and the (m - n)-dimensional CW-complex before.

We prove the first case. n = 4 or (m,n) = (4,4) is assumed. In this case, f- 1(N(C)) is a compact 4-dimensional manifold diffeomorphic to the product of S3 and the closed interval and regarded as a CW-complex simple homotopy equivalent to S3. We have [formula] and from Proposition [\ref=prop:3] ([\ref=prop:3.4]), the restriction of the bundle [formula] over M to f- 1(N(C)) is trivial.

We prove the second case. (m,n) = (4,3) is assumed. Thus, f- 1(N(C)) is a compact 4-dimensional manifold and regarded as a CW-complex simple homotopy equivalent to a 3-dimensional CW-complex and as the product of the 2-dimensional sphere S2 and the compact surface FC with non-empty boundary. It is assumed that for a connected component C0 of the singular value set f(S(f)) and a small closed tubular neighborhood N(C0), the 2nd Stiefel-Whitney class of the restriction of the bundle above to f- 1(N(C0)) vanishes and M is connected. Moreover, it is assumed that for any connected component C of the singular value set f(S(f)) and a small closed tubular neighborhood N(C) as in Definition [\ref=def:3], the restriction of the bundle [formula] above to the normal fiber FC of C corresponding to the bundle f- 1(N(C)) is orientable. We have [formula] and [formula] for any connected component C of the singular value set f(S(f)). By these facts, for any connected component C of the singular value set f(S(f)) and a small closed tubular neighborhood N(C), the 2nd Stiefel-Whitney class of the restriction of the bundle [formula] to f- 1(N(C)) vanishes. From Proposition [\ref=prop:3] ([\ref=prop:3.4]), the restriction of the bundle [formula] over M to f- 1(N(C)) is spin and trivial.

We prove the third and fifth cases. In each case, the result follows from the assumption that for any connected component C of the singular value set f(S(f)) and a small closed tubular neighborhood N(C) as in Definition [\ref=def:3], the restriction of the bundle [formula] to f- 1(N(C)), which is regarded as a CW-complex simple homotopy equivalent to a CW-complex of dimension 2 or 3, is a spin bundle together with Proposition [\ref=prop:3] ([\ref=prop:3.4]).

We can prove the fourth and sixth cases by applying methods similar to that of the second case. So we omit the proof.

By considering specific cases of some cases of Theorem [\ref=thm:1], as a corollary, we have the following.

Cases for round fold maps such that regular fibers are disjoint unions of spheres

In the previous subsection, we obtained new round fold maps by applying P-operations to some locally C∞ trivial round fold maps from m-dimensional round fold maps into [formula] under the constraint that 4  ≥  m  ≥  n  ≥  2 holds. As specific cases, we applied P-operations to locally C∞ trivial round fold maps in the former part of Example [\ref=ex:1] ([\ref=ex:1.2]) and ([\ref=ex:1.3]) and Proposition [\ref=prop:1]. Here, for general pairs (m,n) of dimensions, we apply P-operations to round fold maps satisfying these conditions.

We consider a normal form [formula] of the map f. If we restrict the bundle [formula] over M to the inverse image [formula] of the proper core [formula], then it is trivial by the assumption on [formula].

For any connected component C of the singular value set f(S(f)), we denote a small closed tubular neighborhood as in Definition [\ref=def:3] by N(C) and the normal fiber corresponding to the trivial bundle f- 1(N(C)) explained in Definition [\ref=def:3] by FC. In the definition, the subbundle of the bundle f- 1(N(C)) whose fiber is ∂0FC  ⊂  FC is defined and we assume that the restriction of the bundle [formula] over M to the total space of this subbundle is trivial. Then, by the assumed conditions, the restriction of the bundle to f- 1(N(C)) is also trivial. More precisely, we have this fact as the following.

By the third condition, the fiber of any connected component of the bundle f- 1(N(C)) is Dm - n + 1 or Sm - n + 1 with the interior of a union of disjoint three (m - n + 1 )-dimensional standard closed discs removed. By considering the intersection of the fiber of each connected component of the bundle f- 1(N(C)) and the fiber FC of the bundle f- 1(N(C)), we obtain a subbundle of each connected component of the bundle f- 1(N(C)). By the second condition, the fiber of the resulting bundle is homeomorphic to the sphere Sm - n if the fiber of the connected component of f- 1(N(C)) is homeomorphic to Dm - n + 1 and the fiber of the resulting bundle is homeomorphic to the disjoint union of two copies of the sphere Sm - n if the fiber of the connected component of f- 1(N(C)) is homeomorphic to Sm - n + 1 with the interior of a union of disjoint three (m - n + 1 )-dimensional standard closed discs removed. By considering the homotopy types of the fibers of the connected components of the trivial bundle f- 1(N(C)), we have the desired fact.

By the induction, if we restrict the bundle [formula] over M to f- 1(N(C)) for any connected component C of the singular value set f(S(f)), then it is trivial. Thus we have the statement.

Let C be a connected component of the singular value set f(S(f)) and we take a small closed tubular neighborhood N(C) as presented in Definition [\ref=def:3]. The obtained bundle f- 1(N(C)) is a trivial bundle and the normal fiber FC corresponding to the bundle f- 1(N(C)) is the (m - n + 1)-dimensional standard closed disc Dm - n + 1. By the extra assumption on the bundle [formula] over M that for any (n - 1 )-dimensional standard sphere [formula] embedded in the interior of the image f(M), the restriction to the image of a section of the trivial bundle given by [formula] is trivial, the fact that the previous trivial bundle is a subbundle of the bundle f- 1(N(C)) and the fact that the fiber of the trivial bundle f- 1(N(C)) is diffeomorphic to the disc Dm - n + 1 and contractible, if we restrict the bundle [formula] to f- 1(N(C)), then it is trivial. This completes the proof.

Cases for round fold maps into the plane

In [\cite=kitazawa5], we have obtained a lot of round fold maps by P-operations by the circle S1 to a locally C∞ trivial round fold map into the plane. In this paper, we construct such maps on manifolds regarded as the total spaces of (more general) linear bundles by P-operations.

We introduce a class of round fold maps first introduced in [\cite=kitazawa2].

Let [formula] be a round fold map, and let R be a commutative group.

Let P be a proper core of f. Then, [formula] has a bundle structure mentioned just before Definition [\ref=def:2]. f is said to be homologically R-trivial if for a bundle [formula], the following diagram commutes for the canonical projection p:∂P  ×  f- 1(L)  →  ∂P, the projection of the bundle [formula] and two isomorphisms of homology groups Φ and φ for any integer j.

[formula]

We have the following.

From the assumption that [formula] holds, we have [formula]. Here, we consider the situation of Definition [\ref=def:4] and abuse notation there. Let [formula] be a generator of the group, For [formula], let us regard the tensor product [formula] as an element of H2(∂P  ×  f- 1(L);R) by considering the natural identification and we denote the 2nd homology class [formula] by [formula].

By applying Proposition [\ref=prop:3] ([\ref=prop:3.2]), we can obtain a manifold MK regarded as the total space of a linear bundle whose structure group is SO(2) such that the 2nd Stiefel-Whitney class is the dual of [formula] and construct the desired round fold map [formula]. By constructing the manifold MK as the total space of a standard linear bundle whose fiber is diffeomorphic to Sk satisfying k > 1, we easily have the first statement of the latter three statements too. The former part of the second statement of the latter three statements is clear. In the situation of this statement, there exist a class K and the corresponding manifold MK regarded as the total space of a linear bundle whose structure group is SO(2) such that the 2nd Stiefel-Whitney class of the bundle is the dual of [formula] and that this 2nd Stifel-Whitney class and that of the tangent bundle of the manifold [formula] do not coincide (set K = 0 for example). Thus, we have a round fold map [formula] which is not C∞ trivial since the total space of the bundle obtained by the restriction of the bundle MK to [formula] is not spin by Proposition [\ref=prop:4] ([\ref=prop:4.3]). Last, in the situation of the last statement of the three statements, the resulting manifold MK is not spin, for an proper core PK of the resulting round fold map fK, the inverse image [formula] is not spin, and for an axis LK of the resulting map [formula], the inverse image fk- 1(LK) is spin. Thus, we obtain the last statement of the latter three.

Other cases

First, by applying Proposition [\ref=prop:4] ([\ref=prop:4.2]), we easily have the following proposition.

By virtue of Propositions [\ref=prop:2] and [\ref=prop:5], we immediately have the following.

We have the following theorem.

For any positive integer k, the tangent bundle TSk of the sphere Sk is stably parallelizable, or the Whitney sum of the bundle TSk and a trivial real vector bundle of dimension 1 over Sk is trivial. Moreover, for k = 1,3,7, the tangent bundle is trivial. By virtue of Proposition [\ref=prop:6], in the situation of this theorem, the tangent bundle Tf- 1(N(C)) and the unit tangent bundle UTf- 1(N(C)) is trivial. From Proposition [\ref=prop:2], we have a round fold map [formula] by applying a P-operation.

We also have the following.

As discussed in Example [\ref=ex:6] ([\ref=ex:6.2]), the tangent bundle of the normal fiber FC corresponding to the bundle f- 1(N(C)) is always trivial and the tangent bundle Tf- 1(N(C)) of the manifold f- 1(N(C)) is also trivial by virtue of Proposition [\ref=prop:6]. From this fact, the restriction of the bundle [formula] over M to f- 1(N(C)) is orientable and spin. By Proposition [\ref=prop:3] ([\ref=prop:3.4]), the obtained bundle over f- 1(N(C)) is trivial. We can apply Proposition [\ref=prop:2] and this completes the proof.

Last, we prove two theorems. Before that, we define a trivial embedding of a standard sphere into a manifold as an embedding of the sphere into the interior of the latter manifold which is smoothly isotopic to an unknot in the interior of a standadrd closed disc embedded in the interior of the manifold.

From Proposition [\ref=prop:2] and the assumption that the restriction of the bundle M to [formula] is trivial, we can construct a locally C∞ trivial round fold map [formula] by a P-operation by F to the map f. To show that we can construct such a map satisfying the additional property, we study the structure of obtained map by noticing the definition of a P-operation or the construction demonstrated in the proof of Proposition [\ref=prop:2]. We abuse notation and terminologies in the proof of Proposition [\ref=prop:2].

We may regard the given map f as a normal form. By the definition of a P-operation and the mentioned bundle structure of the restriction of the bundle [formula] over M to [formula], in the proof of Proposition [\ref=prop:2], we can choose the bundle isomorphism Φk (k  ≠  1) as the product of the identification map φk from [formula] onto [formula] and the identity map idF. We can choose the bundle isomorphism Φ1 so that its restriction to the restriction of the bundle [formula] over M to [formula] is the product of the identification map between the resulting base spaces and the identity map idF. Moreover, (the embedding of) the inverse image f- 1(∂f(M)) of the boundary ∂f(M) into [formula] is assumed to be trivial. By virtue of these facts, we can construct the map [formula] so that (the embedding of ) the inverse image [formula] of the boundary [formula] into   ×  F is smoothly isotopic to the restriction of the section of the trivial bundle   ×  F over [formula] to f- 1(∂f(M))  ⊂  . The image of this restriction map is regarded as f- 1(∂f(M))  ×  {p}  ⊂    ×  F where p is a point in F. Hence, (the embedding of ) the inverse image [formula] of the boundary [formula] into   ×  F is a trivial embedding into the total space   ×  F of a resulting trivial bundle and [formula]. This completes the proof.

On the other hand, we also have the following theorem.

We have the following homotopy exact sequence

[formula]

Since the last homomorphism is assumed to be injective, The homomorphism [formula] into πn - 1(M) is an isomorphism.

From this, we immediately have the result.
