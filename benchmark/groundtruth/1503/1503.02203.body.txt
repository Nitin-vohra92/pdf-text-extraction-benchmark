Variations on Dirichlet's theorem

Introduction

Fix [formula]. Dirichlet's theorem states that for every [formula] and Q  ≥  1 there exists [formula] with 1  ≤  q  ≤  Q such that

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the max norm in [formula]. We recall that an immediate corollary to this theorem is that for every irrational [formula], there exist infinitely many reduced rationals [formula] satisfying

[formula]

In this paper, we will refer to this statement as "Dirichlet's corollary", to distinguish it from "Dirichlet's theorem" which is the original statement [\eqref=strong].

Much of classical Diophantine approximation theory can be understood as an attempt to understand when and how Dirichlet's corollary can be improved. For example, we recall that if [formula], then a point [formula] is said to be ψ-approximable if there exist infinitely many reduced rationals [formula] satisfying

[formula]

For each [formula], we use the notation ψc(q): = q- c. Then Dirichlet's corollary states that every irrational vector in [formula] is ψ1  +  1 / d-approximable.

A natural analogue of the notion of ψ-approximability which is capable of expressing Dirichlet's theorem is as follows:

Given [formula] and [formula], we will say that a point [formula] is (Ψ,Q0)-approximable if for all Q  ≥  Q0, there exists [formula] and 1  ≤  q  ≤  Q such that

[formula]

If [formula] is (Ψ,Q0)-approximable for some [formula], then we say that [formula] is Ψ-approximable. If every vector in a set S is (Ψ,Q0)-approximable with Q0 uniform over S, then we say that S is uniformly Ψ-approximable; if Q0 is not uniform, then we simply say that S is Ψ-approximable.

For each [formula], we use the notation Ψa,A(q,Q)  =  q- aQ- A. Then Dirichlet's theorem states that every vector in [formula] is (Ψ1,1 / d,1)-approximable.

A special case of Ψ-approximability which has been considered in the literature is Dirichlet improvability [\cite=DavenportSchmidt1]: a point [formula] is said to be Dirichlet improvable if it is αΨ1,1 / d-approximable for some 0  <  α  <  1. Moreover, [formula] is said to be singular [\cite=Baker1] [\cite=Baker2] if this condition holds for every 0  <  α  <  1. However, until now the following natural question has not been answered: For which pairs [formula] is every point Ψa,A-approximable? Our main result is a complete answer to this question up to a multiplicative constant:

Fix [formula], and let [formula] be given as follows:

[formula]

Fix [formula].

If A  <  fd(a), then for every ε  >  0, [formula] is uniformly εΨa,A-approximable.

If A  >  fd(a), then [formula] is not uniformly κΨa,A-approximable for any κ  >  0.

If A  =  fd(a), then there exist 0  <  ε  ≤  κ  <    ∞   such that [formula] is uniformly κΨa,A-approximable but not uniformly εΨa,A-approximable.

Note that the function fd given by [\eqref=fddef] is continuous and nonincreasing. We now give the proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem1] assuming that it has been verified for the case a∈[0,1], A  =  fd(a):

First we observe that uniform Ψ-approximability has the following comparison properties:

If 0  <  ε  ≤  κ  <    ∞   and A1  <  A2, then every uniformly κΨa,A2-approximable set is uniformly εΨa,A1-approximable.

If a1  +  A1  =  a2  +  A2 and a1  <  a2, then every uniformly αΨa1,A1-approximable set is uniformly αΨa2,A2-approximable.

Property (1) allows us to reduce cases (i) and (ii) of Theorem [\ref=theorem1] to case (iii), while property (2) allows us to omit the verification along the segment a∈(1,1  +  1 / d). Along the segments [formula] and [formula], the uniform Ψa,A-approximability of [formula] is verified by setting q  =  Q and q  =  1 in Definition [\ref=definitionPsiapproximable], respectively, and then choosing [formula] so as to minimize [formula]. The proof that [formula] is not uniformly εΨa,A-approximable when a∈( -   ∞  ,0) can be omitted due to property (2). The existence of badly approximable points implies that [formula] is not εΨa,A-approximable when [formula]. So we are reduced to proving (iii) along the segment a∈[0,1]; for this, see Section [\ref=sectiontheorem1].

Given Theorem [\ref=theorem1], a natural question is whether the negative results in cases (ii) and (iii) can be improved by replacing "uniformly Ψ-approximable" by just "Ψ-approximable". In case (iii), this appears to be a delicate issue, but in case (ii) we have the following answer, which also shows that the set of exceptions to Ψ-approximability is in a sense "large":

Fix [formula] and [formula] such that A  >  fd(a). Then the set

[formula]

is comeager.

The deduction of Theorem [\ref=theorem2] from Theorem [\ref=theorem1](ii) actually holds in a great degree of generality; see Section [\ref=sectiongeneral] for details.

In the case d  =  1, we further investigate the set of exceptions to Ψ-approximability via a kind of "inverse duality principle" reminiscent of the equality between the set of Dirichlet improvable points and the set of badly approximable points [\cite=DavenportSchmidt1]:

Fix [formula] such that a  <  1  <   min (A,A  +  a), and let

[formula]

Suppose that c  >  2. Then there exists a constant C  >  0 such that the following implications hold for [formula] and α  >  0:

If x is αΨa,A-approximable, then x is not (Cαb)- 1ψc-approximable.

If x is not αΨa,A-approximable, then x is Cα- bψc-approximable.

When c  =  2, the conclusion holds if α is sufficiently small.

We remark that the case d  =  1, A  +  a  <  2 of Theorem [\ref=theorem2] follows from Theorem [\ref=theorem3], since the set of Liouville numbers is comeager. On the other hand, since the set of very well approximable numbers is a Lebesgue nullset, it follows that the set considered in Theorem [\ref=theorem3] is a Lebesgue nullset whenever d  =  1 and A  +  a  <  2.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem1]

In this section, we fix [formula] and a∈[0,1], and we let

[formula]

We prove the existence of 0  <  ε  ≤  κ  <    ∞   such that (iii) of Theorem [\ref=theorem1] holds, thus completing the proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem1]. The proof of the existence of ε provides the clearest intuition for why the formula for fd(a) (a∈[0,1]) naturally appears in this context.

Let

[formula]

and note that

[formula]

Now fix [formula] large to be determined, and let

[formula]

so that

[formula]

Now let

[formula]

Let [formula] be a rational such that 1  ≤  q  ≤  Q. Since Qd  >  2Q  ≥  2q  ≥  2  =  Q0, there exists [formula] such that Qi  -  1  ≤  2q  <  Qi. Then

[formula]

and thus since [formula],

[formula]

So

[formula]

i.e. [formula], where ε is the reciprocal of the implied constant.

Fix κ  >  0 large to be determined, and fix [formula] and Q  ≥  Q0: = 1. For each [formula], let [formula] denote the element of [formula] which minimizes [formula]. By contradiction, suppose that

[formula]

There exists a sequence (qi)k  -  10 in [formula] such that if

[formula]

then [formula] is a linearly independent set in [formula] and

[formula]

After reordering, we can without loss of generality assume that the sequence (qi)k  -  1i  =  0 given by Claim [\ref=claimminkowski] satisfies

[formula]

For each [formula] let [formula]. Fix [formula], and let

[formula]

Then for all [formula], we have

[formula]

and thus

[formula]

so

[formula]

It follows that the map [formula] is injective, so

[formula]

Thus by [\eqref=reordering],

[formula]

i.e.

[formula]

Combining with [\eqref=contradictionhypothesis] gives

[formula]

Writing Rj  =   log Q(1 / rj), we get

[formula]

for some constant C1  >  0. Multiplying by ak  -  1  -  j and summing over [formula] gives

[formula]

combining with [\eqref=minkowski] gives

[formula]

where C2  >  0 is a different constant. After choosing κ  >  C2, this is a contradiction to the hypothesis that A  =  fd(a).

Proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem2]

The deduction of Theorem [\ref=theorem2] from Theorem [\ref=theorem1] can be done in a high level of generality, so we recall the following notion:

A Diophantine space is a triple [formula], where X is a complete metric space X, [formula] is a dense subset, and [formula].

The prototypical example is the triple [formula], where [formula] is the standard height function on [formula], i.e. [formula] whenever [formula] is given in reduced form.

Let [formula] be a Diophantine space. An automorphism of [formula] is a bi-Lipschitz map Φ:X  →  X such that [formula] and [formula].

A set K  ⊂  X has the automorphism property if for every nonempty open set B  ⊂  X, there exists an automorphism Φ of X such that Φ(K)  ⊂  B.

The unit cube d in [formula] has the automorphism property. The required automorphisms are just affine transformations of [formula] with rational coefficients.

We give another example to illustrate the nontriviality of our definition.

Let M be a nonsingular rational quadratic hypersurface in projective space [formula], i.e. a set of the form [formula] where [formula] is a nondegenerate rational quadratic form on [formula] and [formula] denotes the point corresponding to [formula]. (See [\cite=FKMS] for a more detailed exposition.) Then if [formula], then [formula] is a Diophantine space (e.g. [\cite=FKMS]). If [formula] is a rational linear subspace of maximal dimension, then the complement of any neighborhood of [formula] has the automorphism property. The required automorphisms are rational projective transformations of [formula] which preserve [formula].

We now state the main result of this section:

Let [formula] be a Diophantine space and let K  ⊂  X have the automorphism property. Suppose that for all Q  >  0, the set [formula] intersects each ball in only finitely many points. Fix [formula], and suppose that K is not uniformly κΨa,A-approximable for any κ  >  0. Then the set

[formula]

is comeager.

The terms here should be understood to refer to the obvious generalizations of the corresponding terms in Definition [\ref=definitionPsiapproximable] to the setting of Diophantine spaces. We remark that Theorem [\ref=theorem2] follows immediately from Proposition [\ref=propositiongeneral] and Theorem [\ref=theorem1](ii), since for any function Ψ, d is uniformly Ψ-approximable if and only if [formula] is.

The set [\eqref=general] can be written in the form [formula], where Uκ,Q0 is the set of points which are not (κΨa,A,Q0)-approximable, i.e.

[formula]

Since for each Q  >  0, the set [formula] has finite intersection with every ball, the intersection over [formula] occurring in this definition can be locally replaced by a finite intersection, so Uκ,Q0 is open. To complete the proof, it suffices to show that Uκ,Q0 is dense. Indeed, let B  ⊂  X be a nonempty open set, and let Φ:X  →  X be the automorphism guaranteed by the automorphism property, so that Φ(K)  ⊂  B. Let C1  >  0 be the bi-Lipschitz constant of Φ, and let C2  >  0 be the bound on height distortion (i.e. the implied constant of the asymptotic [formula]). Since K is not uniformly C1C|a|  +  |A|2κΨa,A-approximable, there exists x∈K such that x is not (C1C|a|  +  |A|2κΨa,A,C2Q0)-approximable. A calculation shows that Φ(x)∈Uκ,Q0. Thus [formula].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem3]

Our main tool for proving Theorem [\ref=theorem3] is the following lemma which is a way of quantifying the fact that the convergents of a real number are the "best approximations" to that real number.

Fix [formula], and let (pn / qn)∞1 be the sequence of convergents of x. Then for all [formula], there exists [formula] such that

[formula]

Before we begin the proof, we recall (cf. [\cite=Khinchin_book]) that for all n,

[formula]

By [\cite=Khinchin_book], we may without loss of generality suppose that p / q is an intermediate fraction, i.e.

[formula]

for some [formula] and 1  ≤  r  ≤  ωn, where pn  +  1  =  ωnpn  +  pn  -  1 and qn  +  1  =  ωnqn  +  qn  -  1. Since p / q and x lie on opposite sides of pn  +  1 / qn  +  1, we get

[formula]

So if r  ≤  ωn / 2, then

[formula]

On the other hand, if r  ≥  ωn / 2, then q  >  (1 / 2)qn  +  1, and

[formula]

Now suppose that x is αΨa,A-approximable for some a  <  1  <   min (A,A  +  a) and α  >  0. Fix [formula] large and let Q  =  qn  +  1 / 2. Then there exists [formula] with 1  ≤  q  ≤  Q such that

[formula]

Let m  ≤  n be chosen so that (1 / 2)qm  <  q  ≤  (1 / 2)qm  +  1. By Lemma [\ref=lemmaconvergents],

[formula]

and thus

[formula]

Rearranging, we have

[formula]

where the last inequality is due to the assumption a  <  1. Rearranging again, we get

[formula]

for all sufficiently large n. Since c  ≥  2, with α small if equality holds, we get αbqc  -  1n  ≥  2qn for all sufficiently large n. Thus we can apply [\cite=Kleinbock5] to complete the proof.

On the other hand, suppose that x is not Cα- bψc-approximable. Then by [\cite=Kleinbock5],

[formula]

for all sufficiently large n. Fix [formula] large and let n be chosen so that qn  ≤  Q  <  qn  +  1. First suppose that a  ≥  0, and let p / q  =  pn / qn. Then

[formula]

On the other hand, if a  ≤  0, then let 1  ≤  r  ≤  ωn be chosen so that rqn  +  qn  -  1  ≤  Q  <  (r  +  1)qn  +  qn  -  1. Then

[formula]

Either way, if C is sufficiently large, then |x  -  p / q|  <  αΨa,A(q,Q). Thus x is αΨa,A-approximable.
