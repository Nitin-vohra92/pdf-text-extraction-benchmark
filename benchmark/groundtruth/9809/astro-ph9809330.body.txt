Introduction to Press Schechter Theory

Following standard Press-Schechter (PS) theory, we convolve a homogeneous, isotropic Gaussian random field representing primordial density fluctuations with a sharp k-space filter. The filter size is related to mass of halo by M = 3 / 4π2ρR3 [formula]. The overdensity of the filtered field at any point traces a Brownian random walk with the variance of the filtered field being the 'time' axis[formula]. Regions are considered to have collapsed to form dark halos of mass > M if this overdensity exceeds a critical overdensity, δc(t). The distribution of halo masses is given by the distribution of upcrossings of the line δ  =  δc(t), a solution of the diffusion equation with absorbing boundary condition[formula]. This leads to a formula for the comoving number density of objects of mass M given time t, n(M,t), the standard PS result :

[formula]

We normalise the power spectrum by setting the variance of the density field, filtered with a top-hat filter of radius 8h- 1 Mpc, σ8 = 0.64. The critical density used with the top-hat filter is that predicted from uniform spherical collapse[formula], that used with a sharp k-space filter is set so that we predict the same number density of halos with both filters at the normalisation mass.

The Halo Formation Rate

We now wish to calculate the distribution of cosmic epochs at which halos of a given mass M are formed, P(t|M). Because of the nature of the random walks if we make δc bound, δmin  ≤  δc  ≤  δmax, it can be thought of as a random variable with uniform probability density. We can remove these bounds later without affecting the result. Using Bayes' theorem and P(σ2|δc), calculated in the previous section, we obtain the conditional probability P(δc|σ2M). Taking the limit as [formula] and δmax  →    ∞   and changing the variables to mass M and time t, we obtain the probability that a halo of mass M formed in the time interval (t,t + dt) :

[formula]

The predictions of equation [\ref=eq:rate_cstm] are compared with the results of both Monte-Carlo analysis and an N-body simulation in Fig. [\ref=fig1]. Excellent agreement is found between all results.

Conclusions

We have shown that we can use Press Schechter theory to produce a simple analytic model of the formation rate of dark halos. Our model uses statistical analysis of the trajectories and overcomes the problem of relating a trajectory through the hierarchical build up of structure to a particular halo. We have shown that the results of this model agree well with those from both Monte-Carlo analysis and from N-body simulations.
