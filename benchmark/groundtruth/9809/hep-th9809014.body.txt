The world of defects is amazingly rich and have been the focus of much attention in many areas of contemporary physics[formula]. The importance of the role of defects in understanding a variety of problems in physics is clear[formula]. As is well known, topology now becomes much more important and necessary in physics, hence it is necessary for us to investigate the topological properties of the defects meticulously. In our previous work, by the use of the φ-mapping topological current theory[formula], we have investigated the topological invariants[formula] and the topological structures of physical systems[formula] successfully. Now, in the light of this useful method, we will study the topological properties of the vortices in the context of an O(n) symmetric time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) model for the case of point defects[formula] where n = k and k is the spatial dimensionality.

We consider a time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau model for an n-component order parameter [formula] governed by the Langevin equation

[formula]

where Γ is a kinetic coefficient and [formula] is a thermal noise which is related to Γ by a fluctuation-dissipation theorem. F is a Ginzburg-Landau effective free energy assumed to be of the form

[formula]

where c < 0 and the potential V is assumed to be of the degenerate double-well form.

In recent years, many works have been done on the system of TDGL model. Liu and Mazenko have discussed the growth kinetics of the systems with continuous symmetry[formula], the defect-defect correlation in the dynamics of first-order phase transitions[formula] and the vortex velocities in the TDGL model[formula]. Ryusuke Ikeda has presented the hydrodynamical description for vortex states in type II superconductors on the TDGL equation[formula]. By the use of the TDGL model, Schönborn and Desai have investigated the intra-surface kinetics of phase ordering on toroidal and corrugated surfaces[formula]. Two-dimensional XY models with resistively-shunted junction dynamics have also been discussed by Kim et.al[formula]. However, most of them concentrated on the dynamical properties of the TDGL model. In this letter, we will focus on the intrinsic topological structure of the vortex topological current and give the topological quantization of the topological charges of the vortices in TDGL model.

It is well known that the n-dimensional order parameter field [formula], which is governed by the Langevin equation, determines the defect properties of the system, and it can be looked upon as a smooth mapping between the (n + 1)-dimensional space-time X and the n-dimensional Euclidean space Rn as φ:X  →  Rn. By analogy with the discussion in our previous work[formula], from this φ-mapping, a topological current can be deduced as

[formula]

[formula]

to describe the vortex state of the system and its zeroth component is defined as the density of the total vortex charge ρ = j0. In the expression, ∂μ stands for ∂  /  ∂xμ, A(Sn - 1) = 2πn / 2  /  Γ(n / 2) the area of (n - 1)-dimensional unit sphere Sn - 1 and na(x) is the direction field of the n-component order parameter field [formula]

[formula]

with

[formula]

It is obvious that [formula] is a section of the sphere bundle S(X) and it can be looked upon as a map of X onto (n - 1)-dimensional unit sphere Sn - 1 in order parameter space. Clearly, the zero points of the order parameter field [formula] are just the singular points of [formula]. From the formulas above, we conclude that in the TDGL model, there exists a conservative equation of the topological current in ([\ref=1])

[formula]

or

[formula]

In the following, we will investigate the intrinsic structure of this vortex topological current ([\ref=1]) by the use of the φ-mapping method. From ([\ref=2]) and ([\ref=3]), we have

[formula]

[formula]

which should be looked upon as generalized function[formula]. Using these expressions the topological current ([\ref=1]) can be rewritten as

[formula]

where Cn is a constant

[formula]

and Gn(||φ||) is a generalized function

[formula]

If we define n + 1 Jacobians [formula] as

[formula]

in which [formula] is just the usual n-dimensional Jacobian determinant

[formula]

and make use of the n-dimensional Laplacian Green's function relation in φ-space[formula] (G(||φ ||))=-δ ( )

[formula]

φ (,t)=0,     a=1, ,n

φ (t,(t)) 0,     a=1, ,n,
