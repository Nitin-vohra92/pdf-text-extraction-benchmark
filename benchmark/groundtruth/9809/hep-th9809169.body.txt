Introduction

At present, there is no gravity which is both perturbatively renormalizable and unitary. The Einstein theory is finite in the one-loop approximation on the motion equations [\cite=TV], however, non-renormalizable at two-loops [\cite=GS] [\cite=VDV] [\cite=VT1]. Moreover, the interaction with matter fields leads to counterterms which are non-renormalizable even at one-loop [\cite=matter]. The supergravity is unproven to be renormalizable at an arbitrary order of perturbation theory [\cite=SUGRA]. The theory, which is quadratic in the curvature, is renormalizable [\cite=st] [\cite=VT2] and has the asymptotical freedom [\cite=asymp], but this theory is not unitary in the linear approximation [\cite=BOS]. All attempts to restore the unitarity at the expense of either quantum corrections or an interaction with matter fields failed [\cite=unitarity]. Hopefully, this problem can be solved in the framework of non-perturbative approaches [\cite=nonpertur]. The superstring approach to the quantum gravity [\cite=GSW] and the canonical one [\cite=A1] recently proposed are claimed as "sensible" theories of quantum gravity.

It is commonly believed that the quantum gravitational corrections can drastically change the classical behaviour of the theory. Due to these quantum corrections it becomes possible to avoid appearance of singularities, to modify the Newtonian potential, to solve the problem of cosmological constant smallness, etc. Since there is no reliable quantum gravity, one should deal with effective models. Among them, the Einstein theory and the R2-gravity are the most investigated and usable. Quantum properties of these theories are widely explored. However, in our opinion, the dependence of the quantum gravity on the parametrization was not studied enough. We consider parametrization arbitrariness as an arbitrariness in choice of dynamical variables in gravity. Both the tensor densities [formula] and [formula] can be considered as a gravitational field. The number of interaction vertices which appear at calculation of radiative corrections and their types can be significantly reduced choosing the appropriate gravitational variables. For example, if we consider gμν as a gravitational variable, the number of three-point interactions in the Einstein gravity is equal to 13 [\cite=GS]; if the tensor density [formula] is selected as a dynamical variable, the number of three-point interactions is equal to 6 [\cite=CLR]. The theorem of equivalence [\cite=equiv] says that the S-matrix of renormalizable theories is invariant under the following replacement:

[formula]

It was shown for an arbitrary gauge theory that the effective action (its finite part and divergencies independently) on the mass shell does not depend on the gauge and parametrization [\cite=VLT]. Whereas the off-shell Green's functions are dependent on the gauge and parametrization.

So, for getting the physical quantities off the mass shell we should get rid of the evident parametrization dependence. It can be done in two ways. First of them is related to using the Vilkovisky-DeWitt effective action which is independent of the gauge and parametrization instead of the standard effective action [\cite=VDW]. But the calculations of loop corrections to the Vilkovisky-DeWitt effective action are very cumbersome due to nonlocal terms in its definition. Moreover, there is a dependence of the Vilkovisky-DeWitt effective action and physical quantities on the configurational space metric choice [\cite=metric] in the quantum gravity. Following [\cite=VDW], the configurational space metric is defined by the highest derivative terms of the classical action. However, the question on correct choice of the configurational space metric in the gravity is still open.

The second way is related to the physical parametrization definition. The best way how the physical parametrization can be defined, we believe, was suggested by Fujikawa [\cite=Fujikawa1]. The anomaly-free condition for the BRST transformations is assumed to define the physical variables. This condition should be imposed on each variable and means that the tensor densities φ* (obtained when the initial fields φ is multiplied by the corresponding degree of ( - g)) are thought of as dynamical variables. For example, in the quantum gravity either [formula] or [formula] ( N is the space-time dimension) can play the role of a physical dynamical variable. All matter fields must be replaced with tensor density fields. These results can also be obtained in the functional integral approach  [\cite=Fujikawa2] without the BRST-symmetry.

Apart from the parametrization dependence conditioned by arbitrariness in the dynamical variables choice, an additional dependence on the parametrization arises due to the quantum field redefinition at calculations of loop corrections. Splitting the dynamical variables in the background field method into classical and quantum parts [formula], the quantum fields can be replaced with

[formula]

Such a redefinition has no physical meaning but allows one to facilitate the calculation of quantum corrections. Parametrization dependence of a given type is not a subject of the current paper.

In this paper we will analyze the dependence of the one-loop counterterms on the gauge and parametrization in the Einstein gravity with the cosmological constant. This paper is organized as follows. In the next section we calculate the one-loop off-shell counterterms in an arbitrary gauge and parametrization. Sect. 3 deals with the calculation of the one-loop counterterms in the special (conformal) parametrization and in an arbitrary gauge. In sect. 4, the gauge and parametrization dependence arising in the first-order formalism is investigated. Sect. 5 concerns the renormalization function calculation off the mass shell in the quantum gravity. Conclusions present the results.

We use the following notations

[formula]

[formula]

where Γσ~  μν is the Riemann connection, and G is the gravitational constant.

Objects marked by the asterisk *   are the tensor densities. The other variables are the tensors. Objects marked by tildes are constructed out of the affine connection Γ̃σ~  μν. The other objects are the Riemannian ones. Parentheses around a pair of indices denote the symmetrization whereas parentheses around four indices mean also the symmetrization with respect to pairs interchange.

The Einstein gravity in arbitrary gauge and parametrization

.

The action of the Einstein gravity with the cosmological constant is

[formula]

where ω is the dimensionless coupling constant, Λ is the cosmological constant and

[formula]

is the Euler number (topological invariant). Further we will consider the space-time which is topologically trivial (χ  =  0). Thus, we have the right to use the relation: RμνσαRμνσα  =  4RμνRμν  -  R2. For calculating the one-loop counterterms we use the background field method [\cite=BDW]. We deal also with the invariant regularization [\cite=inv] (dimensional renormalization [\cite=dim] and minimal subtraction scheme [\cite=min]). In a general case, either of the tensor densities [formula] or [formula] is selected as a dynamical variable of metric theory of the gravity, where r and p are such numbers that

[formula]

In this chapter, under the words first (second) choice of the variables we understand the using [formula] as dynamical variables of the theory. In accordance with the background field method we rewrite the dynamical field as [formula] for the first choice of variables and [formula] for the second one. Here [formula] and [formula] are the classical parts which satisfy the following equations

[formula]

where the values of the coefficients {fi} are given in Table I.

[formula]

and

[formula]

Although the Eq.([\ref=variation]) depends on parametrization, its solution has the standard form:

[formula]

In order to calculate quantum corrections, the action ([\ref=action]) should be expanded in quantum fields powers. The one-loop diagrams are generated by the effective action only as quadratic in quantum fields terms. The one-loop effective Lagrangian has the following form:

[formula]

where

[formula]

and [formula].

The effective Lagrangian ([\ref=effective]) is invariant under general transformations of the coordinates xμ  →  'xμ  =  xμ  +  kξμ(x). The quantum fields are then transformed as follows:

[formula]

for the first set of variables and

[formula]

for the second choice of variables.

Let us analyze the influence of the gauge and parametrization on the structure of propagators. We can scoop information on the particle content of the theory out of the propagator form. For this, we choose the following gauge:

[formula]

To obtain the propagator, the metric should be taken as expansion around the flat background. In this expansion Λ should be equal to zero [\cite=ChD]. Going to the momentum space and using the method of projection operators [\cite=st] [\cite=BOS], we obtain the following graviton propagator:

[formula]

where

[formula]

The ghost propagator is given by

[formula]

Expression ([\ref=graviton]) describes the propagation of the following particles: one massless field of spin-two particle named the graviton, one massless field of spin-one and several massless scalar fields. Note that the coefficient in front of P(2) in ([\ref=graviton]) does not depend on the choice of the gauge and parametrization. On the contrary, the coefficients in front of the other particles are dependent on the gauge and parametrization. However, it is impossible to choose such a gauge and parametrization that only P(2) will propagate. In the trivial parametrization expression ([\ref=graviton]) coincides with the result given in ref.  [\cite=propagator].

Now we investigate the gauge and parametrization dependence of the one-loop counterterms. We fix the gauge invariance by the following condition:

[formula]

[formula]

The ghost action obtained in the standard way is

[formula]

It should be noted that the calculation of one-loop counterterms in arbitrary gauge and parametrization is an extremely cumbersome task. Note that the nonminimal operator of second order arises at calculation. Although the algorithm developed in [\cite=algorithm] can be used for its calculation, we consider that the simplest way is to use the common expression for counterterms of arbitrary-order nonminimal operator given in [\cite=our3]. By using the tensor package of analytic calculations written in REDUCE [\cite=tensor], we obtain that the one-loop divergences in the gauge ([\ref=gf]), ([\ref=gauge]) and in arbitrary parametrization which include the quantum and ghost fields contributions are the following:

[formula]

where {ci} are gauge and parametrization dependent. On mass-shell defined by eq. ([\ref=mass-shell]), we obtain that

[formula]

or, in the other words,

[formula]

This result coincides with that one obtained in ref. [\cite=ChD]. In order to present the result in a more compact form, we write c4 in the Eq.([\ref=result]) as follows:

[formula]

the rest coefficients have the following form:

[formula]

We checked that, in the case Λ = 0 and in the trivial parametrization (r  =  p  =  0), these results reproduce the results of ref. [\cite=algorithm] [\cite=kallosh] [\cite=gauge]. In the special gauge, these results coincide with those of ref. [\cite=MKL].

Let us trace the computing process which allowed us to get these results. The expansion ([\ref=effective]) has been obtained by means of a computer calculation. The next step was to put all the terms including the gauge-fixing ones ([\ref=gf]), ([\ref=gauge]) into the computer. The coefficients {ci} in ([\ref=result]) have been automatically calculated with the algorithm written in [\cite=our3]. The only one problem was to present the obtained data in a compact form. The particular cases (Λ  =  0,r  =  p  =  0, on-shell) have been investigated by using the same computer program. It is worthy to point out once more that the relation ([\ref=sum]) has been tested by calculating {ci} not introducing them from some theoretical considerations.

Although the more elegant and powerful methods like BRST, BFV could be appropriate for theoretical studies, in the current paper we use the well-studied Faddeev-Popov method due to its simplicity at plain calculation.

The Einstein gravity in an arbitrary gauge and in the conformal parametrization

.

The parametrization for the metric field considered in the previous section does not contain special parametrization where the conditions ([\ref=conditions]) are not fulfilled. This special parametrization is related to the choice of a conformal factor for the metric field [formula] and the traceless part [formula] or [formula]. The technique of calculations in this parametrization is equivalent to the one used in the previous chapter. So, we sketch in only the main points.

In accordance with the background field method we rewrite the dynamical field as [formula] and [formula] for the first set of variables or [formula] for second one. In these expansions [formula] is the traceless variable

[formula]

[formula] and [formula] are the classical parts satisfying the following equations:

[formula]

As a result, we obtain once more the expression defined by eq. ([\ref=mass-shell]) for the old mass shell.

The effective Lagrangian which is quadratic in the quantum fields is

[formula]

where

[formula]

[formula]

and the values of the coefficients {ai} are given in Table II.

[formula]

Now the effective Lagrangian ([\ref=eff2]) is invariant under the following general transformations of the coordinates [formula]. The quantum fields are then transformed as follows:

[formula]

and

[formula]

for the first set of variables and

[formula]

for the second one.

We fix the gauge invariance by the condition ([\ref=gf]) where now Fμ are :

[formula]

The one-loop counterterms off the mass shell have the form ([\ref=result]). Taking into account the eq. ([\ref=compact]) the rest coefficients have the following form:

[formula]

where the coefficients {ai} are given in Table II. On the mass shell we have the same result as in ([\ref=on-result]).

The gauge and parametrization dependence of the Einstein gravity in the first-order formalism

In this section we analyze the additional dependence on the gauge and parametrization off the mass shell which can arise in the Einstein gravity in the first-order formalism at the one-loop level. We consider the theory with Lagrangian of the Hilbert-Einstein type without matter fields. In order to construct the theory in the first-order formalism a number of sets of dynamical variables can be used: metric and torsion fields, metric and affine connection, their tetrad analogies, etc. The main criteria at the choice of the connection field arising in the first-order approach is similarity between the mass shell equations in this approach and in the standard one. This agreement ensures the equivalence of these theories at the tree-loop level [\cite=second-class].

We would like to investigate such an equivalence at the one-loop level off the mass shell for the metric field and on the mass shell for the connection field. We consider the most general case of variables: metric gμν and affine connection Γ̃σ~  μν. In the previous studies [\cite=first-order] a special case of the connection, which is symmetric in its indices Γ̃σ~  μν  =  Γ̃σ~ (μν), has been selected. This set of variables as well as any other set can be obtained from our variables by the Lagrange multipliers inclusion in the Lagrangian when the corresponding constraints are provided. No additional gauge and parametrization dependence of the one-loop counterterms appears due to the inclusion of these multipliers. The action with our variables has the following form:

[formula]

In this theory the affine connection Γ̃σ~  μν as well as either of the tensor densities [formula] and [formula] (where [formula]) can be thought of as dynamical variables. The motion equations do not depend on the choice of variables and have the following form:

[formula]

where Dσ~  μν  =  Γ̃σ~  μν  -  Γσ~  μν

This equation can be solved and we obtain the on-shell condition.

[formula]

Let us analyze in more detail the first set of dynamical variables. In accordance with the background field method, we rewrite the dynamical variables as [formula] and [formula]. The Lagrangian for the calculation of the one-loop counterterms has the following form:

[formula]

where

[formula]

and the coefficients {fi} are given in Table I.

It should be noted that the Lagrangian ([\ref=actionf]) is invariant with respect to the extra local projective transformations [\cite=project]

[formula]

where Cν(x) is an arbitrary vector. To define the propagator of the quantum affine connection, one needs to fix the projective invariance at the quantum level. It was shown in [\cite=MKL2] that the special gauge could be chosen so that the corresponding projective ghosts do not contribute to the one-loop divergent terms. Using this special gauge defined by the following conditions:

[formula]

where {Bj} are the constants satisfying the only condition: B1  +  B3  +  4B2  ≠  0, we go to new variables by means of the following replacement:

[formula]

where - 1 has the following form

[formula]

The one-loop effective Lagrangian with new variables on the mass shell for the affine connection has the following form (Dσ~  μν  =  0)

[formula]

where [formula] depends only on the quantum and background parts of the metric and coincides with the Lagrangian ([\ref=effective]). The calculation results for the affine connection (Dσ~  μν  =  0) on the mass shell and for the metric field off the mass shell are in excellent agreement with expressions ([\ref=res]) and ([\ref=res2]), respectively.

It is easy to show that for the action ([\ref=actionf]) two sets of dynamical variables (as metric and affine connection as tetrad and affine local Lorentz connection) give the same results at the one-loop level off the mass shell.

The renormalization group functions calculations off the mass shell

It should be noted once more that the Einstein gravity is renormalizable at the one-loop level on the mass shell. All the one-loop divergences can be removed by only the cosmological constant renormalization. The renormalization of topological constant is trivial due to its independence of the gauge and parametrization. The cosmological constant can be written as

[formula]

where λ is the dimensionless constant. Two dimensional parameters can be connected each other through a new dimensionless constant. As rule, that new constant has no direct physical meaning, but turns out to be convenient at various (in particular, renormalization group) calculations. Moreover, in the representation ([\ref=representation]) counterterms are polynoms of dimensionless coupling constant - which is in agreement with the standard quantum field theory [\cite=Shirkov]. It is easy to get the renormalization group equation within this approach

[formula]

where we have used the definition [formula], and μ2 is the renormalization point. In this approach there is asymptotical freedom for the renormalized constant λ. The gravitational constant is not renormalized: (βG  =  0). Note that

[formula]

where [formula]

Let us consider the other approach. If the theory is on-shell renormalizable (finite), such a gauge or parametrization should exist that this theory will also be off-shell renormalizable (finite) at the one-loop level. This means that the following conditions should be imposed on {ci} (see eqs. ([\ref=result]), ([\ref=compact]) ):

[formula]

In this case, there are divergent terms at the one-loop level (Λ2 and ΛR). Supposing that all the divergences can be absorbed into the gravitational and the cosmological constant, we obtain the following renormalization group equations:

[formula]

where βG is the β-function of the gravitational constant G defined by the relation [formula]. We see that βλ is in excellent agreement with the previous results. However, the β-function of the gravitational constant G behaves differently in these calculation approaches. In the second case, βG obviously depends on the gauge and/or parametrization. If only we think of the Newton constant G as of a constant with no physical meaning (this constant cannot be observed in any experiment), then a dependence of βG on gauge (parametrization) is not dangerous. But the Newtonian potential is one of the indirectly observable quantities, in our opinion; in particular, serves for detection of fifth interaction [\cite=force]. So, it is natural that quantum corrections to the Newtonian potential should not depend on unphysical parameters (gauge and/or parametrization). Therefore, the βG has to be gauge and parametrization independent variable in the MS-scheme and the dimensional regularization [\cite=beta]. The same arguments are correct for βΛ also (see eq.([\ref=cosmological])).

To remove this dependence, we suggest that the method of the renormalization group functions calculation in the gravity should be modified [\cite=MKL-RG]. Let us analyze the renormalization procedure in the one-loop approximation with the special gauge in more detail. Due to the renormalizability at the one-loop level, all the one-loop Green functions are renormalizable too. As a consequence, three renormalization constants may appear: renormalization constant ZG, renormalization constant Zλ and renormalization constant Zg of the metric field gμν.

The renormalization of the background field naturally arises in the background field method. Following the arguments of [\cite=Abbott], it can be shown that the renormalization of quantum and ghost fields in the background field method is not essential to the one-loop background Green functions calculation. Since the tensor densities are thought of as dynamical variables in our calculations, it is natural to suppose that just these dynamical variables should be renormalized instead of the metric tensor. All one-loop divergences can be absorbed into these renormalization constants. We use the minimal subtraction [\cite=min], so that all the Z's contain only poles in ε. Let us consider the parametrization which has been studied in sect. 2. Supposing that after the multiplicative redefinition of the metric and parameters

[formula]

the one-loop background Green functions obtained from the effective action ΓR  =  ΓGRB  +  ΓGRdiv should be finite as ε  →  0, we have

[formula]

where we have taken into account that

[formula]

and all {fi} are given in Table I. From ([\ref=ren1]) we obtain two equations for the renormalization constant δZi

[formula]

To find δZG and δZg, we need one additional equation. We do not know such an equation (see also [\cite=2D] ). The requirement of on-shell renormalizability where only physical parameters of the theory are renormalized (using the on-shell renormalization group equations, in the other words) is not used in the standard field theory; it is a difficult to extract information condition in the case of gravity with matter fields. The fixation of the one-loop δZg, by using the renormalization group method at the two-loop level [\cite=last], does not work in the Einstein gravity due to its nonrenormalizability at the two-loop level. For the time being we do not know how to solve the Eq.([\ref=system]), but we can show that δZg  ≠  0. Let us rewrite the Eq.([\ref=system]) in the following form:

[formula]

where the coefficients θ and c3(θ) depend on choice of parametrization. To solve eqs.([\ref=ren-cond]), even numerically, is quite difficult. But since there is their solution for the trivial parametrization (r  =  p  =  0) [\cite=kallosh], it is natural to expect that there is their solution for arbitrary parametrization also. We will show on example of the conformal parametrization that c3(θ) depends on parametrization for the solutions of eqs.([\ref=ren-cond]). The Eq.([\ref=new-form]) written at two different parametrizations of θ1 and θ2 gives:

[formula]

If the constant of metric field renormalization is equal to zero, then c3(θ) should not depend on parametrization, and Eq. ([\ref=criterion]) is equal to zero. Therefore, the dependence of c3(θ) on parametrization (not on gauge!) can be considered as a criterion of the nonzero constant for metric field renormalization . It should be noted that the existence of such a nonzero constant leads to a modification of anomalous dimensions of matter fields. However, the change of unphysical renormalization group functions must not influence on physical observable.

Now, we consider the conformal parametrization mentioned in sect. 3. In this parametrization four renormalization constants appear: renormalization constant ZG, renormalization constant Zλ , renormalization constant Zπ of the conformal factor of the metric field [formula] and renormalization constant Zψ of the traceless field [formula]. In this case, expression () is replaced with the following one:

[formula]

where all {ai} are given in Table II. The above arguments and the relations

[formula]

give the following equations for the renormalization constants:

[formula]

which are conditioned by the renormalizability at the one-loop level off the mass shell. Let us rewrite these equations as:

[formula]

It is easily seen that the appearance of one additional renormalization constant δZψ leads to even more complicated solution of the renormalization group equations. In this situation, the quantum field theory formalism turns out to be very useful. The one-loop β-function, in the MS-scheme and the dimensional regularization, is gauge, parametrization and scheme independent. So, δZλ obtained from ([\ref=invariant]) should coincide with δZλ obtained from ([\ref=system2]) . Therefore, we have Eq.([\ref=system2]) at hand and

[formula]

Eq.([\ref=trace]) has the same disadvantage as Eq.([\ref=system]). Using the same argumentation as previously, it can be easily shown that the dependence of c3(θ) on parametrization for the solutions of eqs.([\ref=ren-cond]) is the condition that δZπ  ≠  0. A number of numerical solutions of eqs.([\ref=ren-cond]), c3 values, and the accuracy of calculations are given in Table III (these results concern the conformal parametrization).

[formula]

As it is easily seen, c3 depends on parametrization, and δZπ(δZg)  ≠  0. The one additional interesting feature follows the equation ([\ref=traceless]): multiplicative renormalization of the metric field is related to only the conformal mode.

So, we showed that at quantization of gravitational field, a nonzero constant of the metric renormalization appears without fail, if only the Newtonian constant G (or the cosmological constant Λ) is a physical parameter. Then δZG(βG) is gauge and parametrization independent quantity, so that only unphysical parameter - the anomalous dimension of field - depends on gauge and parametrization. The whole renormalization group analysis was performed on the basis of methods and results of the standard quantum field theory. We were not aimed at introduction of new physical conceptions, our purpose was to explain the available results from point of view of the quantum field theory. In particular, for similar reasons we do not use the on-shell renormalization group equations (where βG  =  0, and eqs. ([\ref=system]), ([\ref=invariant2]) simply define the renormalized constant of the metric). The question of a physical meaning of the metric field renormalization is also beyond this paper. At quantization of gravitational field, the metric as quantum field looses its original physical meaning, so it is necessary to define some additional relation (renormalization condition) between renormalized and physical metric.

Conclusions

In this paper, the detailed analysis of the dependence of the Einstein gravity with the cosmological constant in the one-loop approximation has been carried out. In particular, the following questions were considered:

By using the technique of spin-projective operators, the dependence of the gravitational field propagator on the gauge and parametrization has been analyzed.

The one-loop counterterms off the mass shell in an arbitrary gauge and parametrization have been calculated ([\ref=res], [\ref=res2]). It was shown that the freedom in the gauge and parametrization choice (three free parameters) resulted in the different forms for the counterterms off the mass shell (arbitrary values of the coefficients {ci}).

The dependence of the one-loop counterterms on the gauge and parametrization in the first-order formalism has been studied. No additional dependence of the one-loop counterterms off the mass shell on the equations of the connection motion arisen.

Using as an example the Einstein gravity we have showed that to perform the renormalization group function calculation off the mass shell in the 4D quantum gravity correctly, one should take into account the metric field renormalization. Only in this case the renormalization group functions will answer a number of the standard field theory points. In particular, in the dimensional regularization [\cite=dim] and in the MS-scheme [\cite=min] the one-loop β-functions are independent of the gauge and parametrization; all the dependence on unphysical parameters enters the renormalization constants of the wave functions.
