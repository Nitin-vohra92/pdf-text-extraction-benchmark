Impact of Light Higgs Properties on the Determination of tan β and msusy

The minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) is considered to be an attractive candidate as a theory beyond the standard model (SM). In the MSSM, the Higgs sector consists of two Higgs doublets, and there exist five physical states: two CP-even Higgs bosons (h and H with mh < mH), one CP-odd Higgs boson (A), and one pair of charged Higgs bosons (H±). It is possible to derive specific predictions for this Higgs sector because the form of the Higgs potential in the MSSM is very restricted in comparison with that in the general two Higgs doublets model. In particular, the upper bound on the mass of the lightest CP-even neutral Higgs boson is predicted as about 130 GeV.[\cite=OYY] As for the detectability of the Higgs boson, it has been shown that at least one CP-even neutral Higgs boson should be detectable at a future e+e- linear collider with [formula] GeV.[\cite=Janot] Furthermore, the detectability of the Higgs boson is claimed for a large class of SUSY standard models with extended Higgs sectors.[\cite=Kamo]

Once the Higgs boson is discovered, one of the questions of interest is to what extent the parameters related to the Higgs sector will be constrained from the detailed study of properties of the Higgs boson. By branching ratios of the Higgs boson, the mass of a CP-odd Higgs boson (mA) can be constrained almost independently of the SUSY breaking mass scale (msusy) even if the CP-odd Higgs boson is not discovered at future linear colliders with [formula] GeV.[\cite=KOT]

In this paper we consider the determination of parameters of the Higgs sector in the MSSM assuming that only the lightest CP-even Higgs boson will be observed at a future e+e- linear collider with [formula] GeV. It is shown that the allowed msusy-tan β parameter space can be restricted within a narrow region by precise measurements of Higgs boson properties.

Let us begin by listing the parameters of the Higgs sector and the observables which can be used to determine these parameters. At the tree level, the masses of Higgs bosons and the mixing angle among Higgs bosons are determined by two parameters, the CP-odd Higgs boson mass and the ratio of the vacuum expectation values ([formula]), where H1 is a Higgs doublet that couples to up-type quarks and H2 is a Higgs doublet that couples to down-type quarks and leptons. However, once the radiative corrections to the Higgs potential are taken into account, they bring out new parameters in our analysis. In the calculation of the Higgs effective potential at the one loop level, the most important contribution comes from the top and stop loop, and therefore the relevant parameters are two stop masses [formula], a Higgsino mass parameter (μ), and a trilinear soft-breaking parameter (At). For the moment, we assume that no significant effect is induced from the left-right mixing of the stop sector. Then, effectively there are three parameters related to the Higgs sector. As usual, for these three parameters, we take mA, tan β, and msusy defined by [formula]. Then the CP-even Higgs mass matrix[\cite=ERZ] is

[formula]

where

[formula]

represents the leading part of the radiative corrections due to the top-stop loop effect, with [formula] GeV. The masses of CP-even Higgs bosons and the Higgs mixing angle, α, are given by

[formula]

The lightest CP-even Higgs boson is mainly produced through the Higgs-strahlung process, e+e-  →  Zh, at a e+e- linear collider with [formula] GeV. If we assume that the decay modes of the Higgs boson to SUSY particles are not dominant, then the main decay mode of the Higgs boson is the h  →  b mode. In this case, the behavior of the Higgs boson may be similar to that of a Higgs boson in the SM. The lightest Higgs boson then has sizable decay branching ratios in the modes h  →  b,τ,c and gg.

With a reasonable luminosity of [formula] fb- 1/year, the mass of the Higgs boson, mh, can be determined precisely by the recoil mass distribution.[\cite=JLC] [\cite=WCHB] [\cite=NLCHWG] The Higgs production cross section, σ(e+e-  →  Zh), is obtained by the branching ratio of the Z boson decaying into l(l = e,μ) and the cross section of the event with the recoil mass around mh.[\cite=WCHB] The production cross section multiplied by the branching ratio of h  →  X(X = {b},{τ},{c  or gg}), σ(e+e-  →  Zh)Br(h  →  X), can be obtained by the ZX production rate with the invariant mass of X being around mh.[\cite=WCHB] [\cite=NLCHWG]

The three parameters mA, tan β and msusy will be restricted by the observables mentioned above. Expected experimental errors of observables have been estimated in detail.[\cite=NLCHWG] According to there estimates, the error of mh should be 0.1 ~   0.5%. Therefore, in the following, we treat the value of mh as fixed. Thus there are two remaining degrees of freedom of parameters. Hereafter we choose msusy and tan β as free parameters and derive the value of mA with the Higgs mass formula Eq. ([\ref=eqn:mh]) for the fixed value of mh. For mh = 120 GeV, Fig. [\ref=fign:ma] displays the contour plot of mA in the msusy-tan β plane.

The ratio of branching ratios, for example Br(h  →   ~ c  or gg) / Br(h  →   ~ b), will be determined with reasonable precision.[\cite=WCHB] [\cite=NLCHWG] [\cite=Nakamura] The formulas for the partial decay width of the Higgs boson in the MSSM are derived, for example, in Ref. [\cite=Barger]. Higgs-fermion-fermion couplings are listed in Table [\ref=tb:cpl]. The partial decay width for h  →  b and h  →  τ are proportional to the down-type fermion-Higgs coupling, and then the ratio Br(h  →    ~  τ) / Br(h  →   ~ b) is the same as that in the SM. Therefore no information on the parameters of the Higgs sector in the MSSM are obtained from this ratio. On the other hand, as reported in Ref. [\cite=KOT], the ratio Br(h  →  c  or gg) / Br(h  →  b) is a useful variable to constrain the value of mA, because the ratio strongly depends on mA but is almost independent of msusy.

The determination of tan β has great implication for both the theoretical and experimental study of SUSY standard models, because not only the physics of the Higgs sector but also that of other SUSY sectors, for example the chargino and neutralino sector, depend on tan β. Therefore we must start to use other observables in order to determine the values of both msusy and tan β.

Hereafter we use abbreviated notation defined as follows: [formula], [formula] and [formula]  or gg) / Br(h  →  b). These observables give us different constraints on the values of msusy and tan β. As discussed in Ref. [\cite=KOT], we obtain the approximate relation

[formula]

Both σ(e+e-  →  Zh) and σ(e+e-  →  Zh)Br(h  →   ~ b) depend on the angles α and β as

[formula]

where

[formula]

X = b,τ,c,gg. Here Γtot is the total decay width of the light Higgs boson. In Fig. [\ref=fign:obs](a)~  (c) display the contour plots of σZh, σZhBr(b) and Rbr, respectively, in the msusy-tan β plane for mh = 120GeV. The shape of the contours in Fig. [\ref=fign:obs](b) is somewhat different from the other two in the left side of the figure. Fig. [\ref=fign:obs](a) for σZh is similar to Fig. [\ref=fign:obs](c) for Rbr. However, Fig. [\ref=fign:obs](a) displays gentle slope, as compared with Fig. [\ref=fign:obs](c).

Now we combine these observables to estimate the constraints on the values of msusy and tan β. For this purpose, we take msusy and tan β as fitting parameters and then perform the χ2 test in the msusy-tan β plane for a fixed value of mh. The value of mA is derived from the Higgs mass formula Eq.([\ref=eqn:mh]) point-by-point in the msusy-tan β plane.

However, we input the values of mh, m0A and m0susy as true values for the χ2 test, because these variables have clear physical meanings as the mass of particles and a typical mass scale for msusy. As for tan β, the "true" value is calculated from the input parameters, mh, m0A and m0susy, by the Higgs mass formula Eq. ([\ref=eqn:mh]).

Definition of χ2 is given by

[formula]

where δ(σZh), δ(σZhBr(b)) and δ(Rbr) represent expected experimental errors. The estimated error of each observable reported in Ref. [\cite=NLCHWG] is summarized in Table [\ref=tb:error]. σ0Zh, σZhBr(b)0 and R0br are the central values derived from the input parameters, mh,m0A and m0susy. The values of σZh, σZhBr(b) and Rbr are calculated at each point in the msusy versus tan β plane. To calculate the Higgs production cross section, we use [formula]GeV.

The contour plots of χ2 for mh = 120 GeV are shown in Figs. [\ref=fign:ch2i](a) and (b) with a 95%CL contour. We find in Fig. [\ref=fign:ch2i](a) that the tan β is restricted within a relatively small value, tan β < 4.5, and the value of msusy is weakly restricted, msusy > 1 TeV. Fig. [\ref=fign:ch2i](b) displays the contour plot of χ2 for other input value. In Fig. [\ref=fign:ch2i](b), although the upper bounds on msusy and tan β are not obtained in the displayed region, the allowed msusy-tan β parameter space is restricted within a narrow region.

Next, in order to show how each observable contributes to constrain the msusy-tan β parameter space, we show the χ2 contour plots in Fig. [\ref=fign:twof3] by using just two observables among the three observables. We can see from Fig. [\ref=fign:twof3] that Rbr contributes strongly to the constraint on the msusy-tan β plane.

The results above can be understood as follows. Once the value of mh is fixed, tan β and msusy are strongly correlated by the Higgs mass formula Eq. ([\ref=eqn:mh]). We can consider Fig. [\ref=fign:ma] as showing the value of tan β as a function of msusy for fixed values of mh and mA. From Fig. [\ref=fign:ma], the msusy-tan β parameter space is restricted within a relatively narrow region even if mA varies from ~  200 GeV to larger than 1 TeV. However the constraint obtained from Fig. [\ref=fign:ma] is weak as compared with that from Fig. [\ref=fign:ch2i](a) and (b). We can see from Fig. [\ref=fign:twof3] that Rbr contributes strongly to the constraint on the msusy-tan β plane. In Figs. [\ref=fign:ch2i](a) and [\ref=fign:twof3], the value of mA is restricted within about 180  ~  230 GeV by Rbr, and as a result the region satisfying the constraints becomes narrow as compared with that obtained in Fig. [\ref=fign:ma]. The reason why the upper bound on tan β is obtained in Fig. [\ref=fign:ch2i](a) is, in addition to Rbr, σZhBr(b) contributes effectively to the constraint on the msusy-tan β plane.

So far, we have neglected the L-R mixing of the stop sector. We can include the L-R mixing effects and take non-zero values of At and μ in our analysis. In this case, examples are shown in Fig. [\ref=fign:LR]. The contour should be shifted by varying the values of At and μ. However, the result of our analysis will not change essentially, because Rbr is almost independent of the parameters of the stop sector, as shown in Ref. [\cite=KOT].

With regard to theoretical aspects, the requirement of Yukawa coupling unification in SUSY-GUT[\cite=YKWU] restricts the value of tan β to two solutions. One is the small tan β solution, tan β = 1  ~  3, and the other one is the large tan β solution, tan β  ~  50. There are mainly two types of scenarios for Yukawa coupling unification. These are the bottom-tau Yukawa unification and the top-bottom-tau Yukawa unification scenarios. The requirement of bottom-tau Yukawa coupling unification suggests both the small tan β solution and the large tan β solution. However, the requirement of top-bottom-tau Yukawa coupling unification suggests only the large tan β solution. Therefore, if a large value of tan β will be excluded by precise measurements of light Higgs properties at a future linear collider, for example as we have shown in Fig. [\ref=fign:ch2i](a), the experiments may rule out the top-bottom-tau Yukawa unification scenario even if only the lightest CP-even Higgs boson is observed.

We now conclude our discussion. We have examined whether the parameters of the Higgs sector in the MSSM can be determined by detailed study of Higgs properties. We have found that the values of tan β and msusy are restricted within a very narrow region even if only the light Higgs boson is discovered. Rbr contributes strongly to the constraint on the msusy-tan β plane. We also have shown that the upper bound on tan β may be obtained by combining analysis of observables when σZhBr(b) contributes effectively to the constraint. However, to obtain a more strict constraint on both msusy and tan β, we need constraints inferred from other quantities obtained from heavy Higgs and/or SUSY particles.
