Introduction

In 1995, sg-compact spaces were introduced independently by Caldas [\cite=CC1] and by Devi, Balachandran and Maki [\cite=DBM1]. A topological space (X,τ) is called sg-compact [\cite=CC1] if every cover of X by sg-open sets has a finite subcover. In [\cite=DBM1], the term SGO-compact is used.

Recall that a subset A of a topological space (X,τ) is called sg-open [\cite=BL1] if every semi-closed subset of A is included in the semi-interior of A. A set A is called semi-open if [formula] and semi-closed if [formula]. The semi-interior of A, denoted by sInt(A), is the union of all semi-open subsets of A while the semi-closure of A, denoted by sCl(A), is the intersection of all semi-closed supersets of A. It is well known that sInt(A) = [formula] and sCl(A) = [formula] .

Every topological space (X,τ) has a unique decomposition into two sets X1 and X2, where X1  =  {x∈X:{x} is nowhere dense} and X2  =  {x∈X:{x} is locally dense}. This decomposition follows from a result of Jankovi and Reilly [\cite=JR1]. Recall that a set A is said to be locally dense [\cite=CM1] (= preopen) if [formula].

It is a fact that a subset A of X is sg-closed (= its complement is sg-open) if and only if [formula] [\cite=DM1], or equivalently if and only if [formula]. By taking complements one easily observes that A is sg-open if and only if [formula]. Hence every subset of X2 is sg-open.

Sg-compact spaces

Let A be a sg-closed subset of a topological space (X,τ). If every subset of A is also sg-closed in (X,τ), then A will be called hereditarily sg-closed (= hsg-closed). Observe that every nowhere dense subset is hsg-closed but not vice versa.

For a subset A of a topological space (X,τ) the following conditions are equivalent:

(1) A is hsg-closed.

(2) [formula].

Proof. (1) ⇒   (2) Suppose that there exits [formula]. Let Vx be an open set such that [formula] and let [formula]. Since B is sg-closed, i.e. [formula], we have [formula], hence [formula], and thus [formula]. If [formula], then H is nonempty and open with [formula] and [formula] and so [formula]. Hence [formula], i.e. [formula]. Thus x∈X2, a contradiction.

(2) ⇒   (1) Let B  ⊆  A. Then [formula] and [formula], i.e. B is sg-closed. [formula]

We will call a topological space (X,τ) a C2-space [\cite=G1] (resp.  C3-space) if every nowhere dense (resp. hsg-closed) set is finite. Clearly every C3-space is a C2-space. Also, a topological space (X,τ) is indiscrete if and only if every subset of X is hsg-closed (since in that case [formula]).

Following Hodel [\cite=H1], we say that a cellular family in a topological space (X,τ) is a collection of nonempty, pairwise disjoint open sets. The following result reveals an interesting property of C2-spaces.

Let (X,τ) be a C2-space. Then every infinite cellular family has an infinite subfamily whose union is contained in X2.

Proof. Let [formula] be a cellular family. Suppose that for infinitely many [formula] we have [formula]. Without loss of generality we may assume that [formula] for each [formula]. Now pick [formula] for each [formula] and partition [formula] into infinitely many disjoint infinite sets, [formula]. Let [formula]. Since [formula] and [formula] for each k, it is easily checked that [formula] is a disjoint family of open sets. Since X is a C2-space, Ak cannot be nowhere dense and so, for each k, there exists [formula] and the pk's are pairwise distinct. Also, since X is C2, [formula], where F is finite. Since [formula] for each k, there exists k0 such that [formula] for k  ≥  k0, and since [formula], we have [formula] for k  ≥  k0. Now, for each k  ≥  k0 pick [formula] such that pk∈Uik, and so [formula]. Thus [formula]. Hence {xik} is locally dense, a contradiction. This shows that only for finitely many [formula] we have [formula]. Thus the claim is proved. [formula]

The α-topology [\cite=Nj1] on a topological space (X,τ) is the collection of all sets of the form [formula], where U∈τ and N is nowhere dense in (X,τ). Recall that topological spaces whose α-topologies are hereditarily compact have been shown to be semi-compact [\cite=GJR1]. The original definition of semi-compactness is in terms of semi-open sets and is due to Dorsett [\cite=D1]. By definition a topological space (X,τ) is called semi-compact [\cite=D1] if every cover of X by semi-open sets has a finite subcover.

(i) The 1-point-compactification of an infinite discrete space is a C2-space having an infinite cellular family.

(ii) [\cite=G1] A topological space (X,τ) is semi-compact if and only if X is a C2-space and every cellular family is finite.

(iii) [\cite=HD1] Every subspace of a semi-compact space is semi-compact (as a subspace).

(i) Every C3-space (X,τ) is semi-compact.

(ii) Every sg-compact space is semi-compact.

Proof. (i) All C3-spaces are C2-spaces. Thus in the notion of Remark [\ref=r1] (ii) above we need to show that every cellular family in X is finite. Suppose that there exists an infinite cellular family [formula]. For each [formula] pick xi∈Ui and, as before, partition [formula] and set [formula]. Since X is a C2-space, [formula] is a cellular family. By Lemma [\ref=l1], there is a [formula] such that [formula]. Since Ak is not hsg-closed, we must have [formula], a contradiction. So, every cellular family in X is finite and consequently (X,τ) is semi-compact.

(ii) is obvious since every semi-open set is sg-open. [formula]

(i) It is known that sg-open sets are β-open, i.e. they are dense in some regular closed subspace [\cite=JD1]. Note that β-compact spaces, i.e. the spaces in which every cover by β-open sets has a finite subcover are finite [\cite=G2]. However, one can easily find an example of an infinite sg-compact space - the real line with the cofinite topology is such a space.

(ii) In semi-TD-spaces the concepts of sg-compactness and semi-compactness coincide. Recall that a topological space (X,τ) is called a semi-TD-space [\cite=JR1] if each singleton is either open or nowhere dense, i.e. if every sg-closed set is semi-closed.

For a topological space (X,τ) the following conditions are equivalent:

(1) X is sg-compact.

(2) X is a C3-space.

Proof. (1) ⇒   (2) Suppose that there exists an infinite hsg-closed set A and set [formula]. Observe that for each x∈A, the set [formula] is sg-open in X. Thus [formula] is a sg-open cover of X with no finite subcover. Thus (X,τ) is C3.

(2) ⇒   (1) Let [formula], where each Ai is sg-open. Let Si  =  sInt(Ai) for each i∈I and let [formula]. Then S is a semi-open subset of X and each Si is a semi-open subset of (S,τ|S). Since X is a C3-space, (X,τ) is semi-compact and hence (S,τ|S) is a semi-compact subspace of X (by Remark [\ref=r1] (iii)). So we may say that [formula]. Since Ai is sg-open, we have [formula] for each index i and so [formula]. Hence [formula] is semi-closed and [formula]. Since [formula], we conclude that [formula] is hsg-closed and thus finite. This shows that [formula], where F is finite, i.e. (X,τ) is sg-compact. [formula]

(i) If X1  =  X, then (X,τ) is sg-compact if and only if (X,τ) is semi-compact. Observe that in this case sg-closedness and semi-closedness coincide.

(ii) Every infinite set endowed with the cofinite topology is (hereditarily) sg-compact.

It is known that an arbitrary intersection of sg-closed sets is also an sg-closed set [\cite=DM1]. The following result provides an answer to the question about the additivity of sg-closed sets.

(i) If A is sg-closed and B is closed, then [formula] is also sg-closed.

(ii) The intersection of a sg-open and an open set is always sg-open.

(iii) The union of a sg-closed and a semi-closed set need not be sg-closed, in particular, even finite union of sg-closed sets need not be sg-closed.

Proof. (i) Let [formula], where U is semi-open. Since A is sg-closed, we have [formula].

(ii) follows from (i).

(iii) Let X  =  {a,b,c,d}, [formula]. Note that the two sets A  =  {a} and B  =  {b} are semi-closed but their union {a,b} is not sg-closed. [formula]

Theorem 3 from [\cite=BL1] states that if B  ⊆  A  ⊆  (X,τ) and A is open and sg-closed, then B is sg-closed in the subspace A if and only if B is sg-closed in X. Since a subset is regular open if and only if it is α-open and sg-closed [\cite=DP1], by using Proposition [\ref=r3], we obtain the following result:

Let R be a regular open subset of a topological space (X,τ). If A  ⊆  R and A is sg-open in (R,τ|R), then A is sg-open in X. [formula]

Proof. Since [formula] is sg-closed in (R,τ|R), B is sg-closed in X by [\cite=BL1]. Thus [formula] is sg-open in X and by Proposition [\ref=r3] (ii), [formula] is sg-open in X. [formula]

Recall that a subset A of a topological space (X,τ) is called δ-open [\cite=V1] if A is a union of regular open sets. The collection of all δ-open subsets of a topological space (X,τ) forms the so called semi-regularization topology.

If A  ⊆  B  ⊆  (X,τ) such that B is δ-open in X and A is sg-open in B, then A is sg-open in X.

Proof. Let [formula], where each Bi is regular open in (X,τ). Clearly, each Bi is regular open also in (B,τ|B). By Proposition [\ref=r3] (ii), [formula] is sg-open in (B,τ|B) for each i∈I. In the notion of Proposition [\ref=p4], [formula] is sg-closed in (X,τ) for each i∈I. Hence [formula] is sg-open in (X,τ). Again by Proposition [\ref=r3] (ii), [formula] is sg-open in (X,τ). Since any union of sg-open sets is always sg-open, we have [formula] is sg-open in (X,τ). [formula]

Every δ-open subset of a sg-compact space (X,τ) is sg-compact, in particular, sg-compactness is hereditary with respect to regular open sets.

Proof. Let A  ⊆  X be δ-open. If {Ui:i∈I} is a sg-open cover of (S,τ|S), then by Corollary [\ref=c2], each Ui is sg-open in X. Then, {Ui:i∈I} along with [formula] forms a sg-open cover of X. Since X is sg-compact, there exists a finite F  ⊆  I such that {Ui:i∈F} covers A. [formula]

Let A be an infinite set with [formula]. Let [formula] and [formula].

(i) Clearly, X1  =  {p}, X2  =  A and for each infinite B  ⊆  X, we have [formula]. Hence [formula], so B is not hsg-closed. Thus (X,τ) is a C3-space, so sg-compact. But the open subspace A is an infinite indiscrete space which is not sg-compact. This shows that (1) hereditary sg-compactness is a strictly stronger concept than sg-compactness and (2) in Proposition [\ref=p2] 'δ-open' cannot be replaced with 'open'.

(ii) Observe that X  ×  X contains an infinite nowhere dense subset, namely [formula]. This shows that even the finite product of two sg-compact spaces need not be sg-compact, not even a C2-space.

(iii) [\cite=MBD1] If the nonempty product of two spaces is sg-compact Tgs-space (see [\cite=MBD1]), then each factor space is sg-compact.

Recall that a function f:(X,τ)  →  (Y,σ) is called pre-sg-continuous [\cite=N1] if f- 1(F) is sg-closed in X for every semi-closed subset F  ⊆  Y.

(i) The property 'sg-compact' is topological.

(ii) Pre-sg-continuous images of sg-compact spaces are semi-compact. [formula]
