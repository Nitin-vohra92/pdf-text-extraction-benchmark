On endomorphisms of surface mapping class groups

Corollary Proposition Lemma Definition

ABSTRACT: We prove in this paper that every endomorphism of the mapping class group of certain orientable surfaces onto a subgroup of finite index is in fact an automorphism.

Introduction

Let S be a compact connected orientable surface. The mapping class group MS of the surface S is the group of isotopy classes of orientation preserving diffeomorphisms S  →  S. The extended mapping class group M*S of S is the group of isotopy classes of all diffeomorphisms S  →  S. Note that the isotopy classes of orientation reversing diffeomorphisms are also included in M*S, and hence MS is a subgroup of M*S of index two.

Recall that a group G is called residually finite if for each x  ≠  1 in G there exists a homomorphism f from G onto some finite group such that f(x) is nontrivial. Equivalently, there is some finite index normal subgroup of G that does not contain x. G is called hopfian if every surjective endomorphism of G is an automorphism. It is well known that finitely generated residually finite groups are hopfian [\cite=ls]. G is called cohopfian if every injective endomorphism of G is an automorphism.

The mapping class group of an orientable surface is finitely generated [\cite=l] [\cite=b] and residually finite [\cite=g] [\cite=i1]. Hence it is hopfian. N.V. Ivanov and J.D. McCarthy [\cite=im] proved that MS is also cohopfian. Author and J.D. McCarthy [\cite=km] proved that if φ:MS  →  MS is a homomorphism such that φ(MS) is a normal subgroup and MS  /  φ(MS) is abelian, then φ is an automorphism.

In this paper, we prove further that if φ is an endomorphism of the mapping class group MS onto a finite index subgroup, then φ is in fact an automorphism, with a few exceptions. The proof of this result relies on a result of R. Hirshon, which states that if φ is an endomorphism of a finitely generated residually finite group G such that φ(G) is of finite index in G, then φ restricted to φn(G) is an injection for some n.

D.T. Wise [\cite=w] gave an example of a finitely generated residually finite group G and an endomorphism Φ of G such that the restriction of Φ to Φn(G) is not injective for any n, answering a question of R. Hirshon in negative. It might be interesting to consider the same question for mapping class groups of surfaces.

Endomorphisms of mapping class groups

Let S be a compact connected oriented surface of genus g with b boundary components. For any simple closed curve a on S, there is a well known diffeomorphism, called a right Dehn twist, supported in a regular neighborhood of a. We denote by ta the isotopy class of a right Dehn twist about a, also called a Dehn twist. Note that ftaf- 1 = tf(a) for any orientation preserving mapping class f.

The pure mapping class group PMS is the subgroup of MS consisting of those orientation preserving mapping classes which preserve each boundary component.

For a group G and a subgroup H of it, we denote by CG(H) the centralizer of H in G. The center of G is denoted by C(G).

Let G be a finitely generated residually finite group, and let φ be an endomorphism of G onto a finite index subgroup. Then there exists an n such that the restriction of φ to φn(G) is an injection.

Let S be a compact connected orientable surface of genus g with b boundary components. Suppose, in addition, that if g = 0 then b  ≥  5, if g = 1 then b  ≥  3, and if g = 2 then b  ≥  1. Then any isomorphism between two finite index subgroups of the extended mapping class group M*S is the restriction of an inner automorphism of M*S.

Theorem [\ref=thm1] was proved by R. Hirshon ([\cite=h]), and Theorem [\ref=thm2] was proved by N.V. Ivanov [\cite=i2] for surfaces of genus at least two and by the author [\cite=k] for the remaining cases. Since the mapping class group MS is normal in M*S, we deduce the following theorem.

Let S be a compact connected orientable surface of genus g with b boundary components. Suppose, in addition, that if g = 0 then b  ≥  5, if g = 1 then b  ≥  3, and if g = 2 then b  ≥  1. Then any isomorphism between two finite index subgroups of the mapping class group MS is the restriction of an automorphism of MS.

Let S be a closed orientable surface of genus two and let Γ be a finite index subgroup of MS. Then the center C(Γ) of Γ is equal to [formula], where σ is the hyperelliptic involution.

Proof: Since the subgroup 〈σ〉  =  {1,σ} is the center of MS, its intersection with Γ is contained in the center of Γ.

Now let f∈C(Γ) and let N be the index of Γ in MS. Since tNa∈Γ for all simple closed curves a, we have tNf(a) = ftNaf- 1 = tNa. It follows that f(a) = a (cf. [\cite=im]). Hence, ftaf- 1 = tf(a) = ta. Since MS is generated by Dehn twists, f∈C(MS)  =  〈σ〉. [formula]

We are now ready to state and prove the main result of this paper.

Let S be a compact connected orientable surface of genus g with b boundary components. Suppose, in addition, that if g = 0 then b  ≠  2,3,4, and if g = 1 then b  ≠  2. If φ is an endomorphism of MS such that φ(MS) is of finite index in MS, then φ is an automorphism.

Proof: If S is a (closed) sphere or a disk, then MS is trivial. Clearly, the conclusion of the theorem holds.

Suppose first that S is a torus with b  ≤  1 boundary component. It is well known that MS is isomorphic to [formula]. The commutator subgroup of [formula] is a nonabelian free group of rank 2 and its index in [formula] is 12. Let us denote it by F2. φ(F2) is contained in F2 as a finite index subgroup. If this index is k, φ(F2) is a free group of rank k + 1. Since there is no homomorphism from F2 onto a free group of rank ≥  3, it follows that k = 1. That is, φ(F2) = F2. In particular, [formula] contains F2. The fact that φ is an automorphism in this case was proved in [\cite=km].

Suppose now that S is not one of the surface above and not a closed a surface of genus 2. Let us orient S arbitrarily. Since MS is finitely generated and residually finite, there exists an n such that the restriction of φ to φn(MS) is an isomorphism onto φn + 1(MS). Note that the subgroups φn(MS) and φn + 1(MS) are of finite index in MS. Hence, there is an automorphisms α of MS such that the restrictions of α and φ to φn(MS) coincide.

Let N be the index of φn(MS) in MS. For any simple closed curve a on S, tNa is contained in φn(MS). Hence, α(tNa) = φ(tNa). Let f∈MS be any element. Then

[formula]

Hence, α- 1(φ(f))(a) = f(a) for all a (cf. [\cite=im]). It follows that f- 1α- 1(φ(f)) commutes with all Dehn twists. Since PMS is generated by Dehn twists, it is in CMS(PMS), the centralizer of PMS in MS. But CMS(PMS) is trivial [\cite=im]. Hence, α- 1(φ(f)) = f. Therefore, φ  =  α. In particular, φ is an automorphism.

Suppose finally that S is a closed surface of genus two. Let R be a sphere with six holes. Then MR is isomorphic to the quotient of MS with its center 〈σ〉, where σ is the hyperelliptic involution (cf. [\cite=bh]) . Let us identify MR and Ms  /  〈σ〉, and let π:MS  →  MR be the quotient map. Since φ(σ) is in the center of φ(MS), either φ(σ) = σ or φ(σ) = 1 by the lemma above.

If φ(σ) = σ, then φ induces an endomorphism Φ of MR, such that πφ  =  Φπ. Then we have a diagram in which all squares are commutative:

[formula]

where I is the identity homomorphism. Since the image Φ(MR) of Φ is of finite index, Φ is an automorphism by the first part. By 5-lemma, φ is an automorphism.

If φ(σ) = 1, then φ induces a homomorphism [formula] such that [formula]. The image of the endomorphism [formula] of MR has finite index. Since R is a sphere with six holes, Φ is an automorphism by the first part. Then, φ is an automorphism, and hence σ = 1. This contradiction finishes the proof of our theorem. [formula]

Remark: If S is a sphere with two holes, then MS is a group of order two, and if S is a sphere with three holes, then MS is isomorphic to the symmetric group on three letters. Hence, in these cases the trivial homomorphism is an endomorphism onto a finite index subgroup which is not automorphism. We do not know if the conclusion of Theorem [\ref=mthm] holds if a sphere with four holes and a torus with two holes.
