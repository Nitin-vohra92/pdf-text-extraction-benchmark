INTRODUCTION

It is well established, after the GRANAT/SIGMA and CGRO missions, that a power-law spectra extending beyond 30keV are not exclusive signatures of a black hole in an X-ray binary system (Barret and Vedrenne, 1994; Barret, McClintock, and Grindlay, 1996). High sensitivity observations with RXTE (e.g., Heindl and Smith, 1998; Barret et al., 2000) have shown the presence of hard X-ray flux in other types of low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) and BeppoSAX observations also have detected hard X-ray flux from LMXBs systems (see, e.g., Frontera et al., 2000; Iaria et al., 2000; Di Salvo et al., 2000).

In this work we studied the hard X-ray spectrum of Sco X-1, a high luminosity LMXB Z source, using the High Energy X-ray Timing Experiment (HEXTE) on-board RXTE. The presence of a non-thermal component in Sco X-1 spectra has been historically reported (e.g., Peterson and Jacobson, 1966; Haymes et al., 1972; Duldig et al., 1983), but much more sensitive searches have failed to detect such a component, placing strong upper limits on the non-thermal flux (e.g., Greenhill et al. 1979; Rothschild et al., 1980; Soong and Rothschild, 1983). Recently, Strickman and Barret (2000) reported the presence of a hard X-ray tail in Sco X-1 using CGRO/OSSE. Thanks to the HEXTE sensitivity, we show here, on several occasions, strong evidence for the presence of this variable non-thermal component extending up to 220keV.

This present study is an extension of a previous work (D'Amico et al., 2000) with the use of an expanded database from the public RXTE archive of Sco X-1 observations, containing data from 1997 April to 1999 July. Our on-source time (for the Proportional Counter Array, PCA) is 203,440s in 22 subsets of data (an improvement factor of 30% over our previous study) which, in turn, provided us with more than 100ks of on-source live time in HEXTE. In the next sections we describe our data selection and analysis, then we discuss the detection of a non-thermal component and present our conclusions.

DATA SELECTION AND ANALYSIS

We used data from HEXTE (Rothschild et al., 1998) to search for hard X-ray tails in Sco X-1 in the ~  20-220keV interval and data from PCA (Jahoda et al., 1996) to determine the position of the source in the Z diagram. We have chosen, from the public RXTE database of Sco X-1, those subsets of data in which [formula]5000s of HEXTE total on-source time was available, in order to achieve good sensitivity at high energies, resulting in 22 RXTE observations (as of 2000 August) that cover the period from 1997 April to 1999 July. If, in a particular observation, the source was moving back and forth from the normal to the flaring branch (see, e.g., van der Klis, 1995), then we split the data according to the branch resulting in the 28 observation segments displayed in Table 1. Since we are primarily interested in the study of the non-thermal ([formula]50keV) spectra of the source (the "hard" component of the spectrum), we have simply modeled the (HEXTE) low energy thermal component as thermal bremsstrahlung emission .

We refer the reader to D'Amico et al. (2000), for a more detailed description of the instrument and data analysis.

RESULTS

We developed two criteria to determine the presence of a hard X-ray tail in a particular spectrum: 1) a signal to noise ratio (SNR) ≥  5 in the 75-220keV energy range, and 2) an F-Test null significance for the addition of the hard component at a level of 10- 7 or less. We claim that we observed a hard X-ray tail only when both of these criteria are fulfilled. We have 8 clear detections of non-thermal flux in Sco X-1 spectra, with the hard X-ray tail extending at least to 220keV. The spectral parameters derived for those observations are shown in Table 2. Similarly, we defined a strong non-detection when 1) the SNR in the 75-220keV is <  1, and 2) the F-Test was at a level of [formula]10- 5. We thus observed (see Table 1) 4 strong non-detections. We note that several of our observations have very significant F-Test values, but with an SNR<  {. In those cases we do not claim that we have observed a hard X-ray tail, although this is an open possibility. In Figure [\ref=fig1] we show one of our clear detection spectra, together with a spectrum when we have not detected a hard component.

We observed a variation of a factor of ~  3 in the flux of the non-thermal component in the 20-200keV interval among our 8 detections, and, at least, an order of magnitude in overall variability, taking into account our entire database.

We were also able to study the time-scale of variations of the hard X-ray component. As can be seen in Table 1, for observation 20 we detected a hard X-ray tail, which was not present 4 hours later in observation 21. To our knowledge, this is the first time that such a short time-scale variability in the hard component is reported for Sco X-1.

We also note that on all 3 occasions that the source was in the HB, a hard X-ray tail was detected.

DISCUSSION

Taking 2.5kpc as the lower limit to the distance to Sco X-1 (Bradshaw, Fomalont, and Geldzahler, 1999), we found (using the PCA data) Sco X-1 to be emitting near the Eddington level in the 2-20keV band (for a 1.4M[formula] neutron star). This is remarkably different from the atoll sources (Barret et al., 2000), in which the luminosity in the same energy range is below 1037ergss- 1 when a hard tail is detected. The 20-200keV hard component luminosity variation between our 8 detections is 5.9-15.0×  1035ergss- 1, which is comparable to the weaker atoll sources hard X-ray luminosities reported by Barret, McClintock, and Grindlay (1996).

We have observed the presence of a hard X-ray tail in each of the 3 branches on the Z diagram. Although it is unclear what is producing the hard X-ray tail in Sco X-1, as can be seen in Figure [\ref=fig2]a, it appears that the chance of observing a hard X-ray tail is greater if the thermal component is brighter. This assumes that the thermal component observed in HEXTE 20-50keV band can be used to trace its E<   20keV behavior. When we do observe a hard component, the power law index is correlated with the soft component temperature. (Figure [\ref=fig2]b). One other interesting and suggestive relationship (Figure [\ref=fig2]c) is that the hard component flattens as the mass accretion rate ([formula]) increases, if we assume that the movement along the Z diagram (from the horizontal to the flaring branch) is the result of the increasing variation of the [formula] (see, e.g., van der Klis, 1995). Thus it is possible to speculate that the mechanism responsible for the production of the hard component and its shape is dependent on the [formula], the 20-50keV flux, and temperature of the soft thermal component. We note that while is straightforward to explain the derived power law indices, and the hard X-ray emission, when the source was observed in the HB and in the FB in terms of synchrotron emission or Comptonization models, our measured photon indices in the FB (consistent with 0) are not compatible with the hard X-ray emission being produced by one of those two mechanisms.

Our HEXTE observations 20-22 and 26 (see Table1) overlap with BATSE/OSSE observations reported in Strickman and Barret (2000). It is interesting to note that while HEXTE detected the presence of the hard X-ray tail in observations 20 and 22, BATSE/OSSE did not. Meanwhile, in observation 26 the hard X-ray tail was detected both by HEXTE and BATSE/OSSE, with a spectrum extending up to ~  400keV.

Our measured luminosities in the 2-20keV (Lx) and 20-200keV energy intervals (Lhx) can be used to study the suggestion (Barret et al., 2000) that such luminosities can be used to distinguish between neutron star and black hole systems, with neutron stars systems emitting Lhx  ~  Lx when [formula], with Lcrit  =  1.5×  1037ergss- 1. Since Sco X-1 is emitting close to the Eddington level, our observations can not be used to test the hypothesis for the 2-20keV luminosity (see details in Barret et al., 2000). Otherwise our observations of Lhx are in agreement with the idea that only black hole binaries can have both Lx and Lhx above Lcrit.

CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we provided clear evidence for variable hard X-ray emission from the Z source Sco X-1. We observed that the 20-200keV non-thermal component varied by at least an order of magnitude. We were able to track the movement of the source along the Z diagram and we concluded that the presence of the hard X-ray tail is not confined to a particular position in such a diagram, which may suggest that the mechanism responsible for the production of the hard X-ray tail is not uniquely dependent on the inferred [formula]. Otherwise we speculated that the appearance of a hard component in the spectrum may be related to the brightness of the thermal component, and that the shape of the X-ray tail may be correlated with the temperature of the thermal component.
