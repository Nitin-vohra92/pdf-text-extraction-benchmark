Doi-Koppinen modules for quantum groupoids

Introduction

Doi-Koppinen modules introduced in [\cite=Doi:uni] [\cite=Kop:var] as a generalisation of (co)modules or Hopf modules studied in Hopf algebra theory can be viewed as a representation of a triple comprising an algebra, a coalgebra and a bialgebra which satisfy certain compatibility conditions. Recently these have been generalised to the case in which a bialgebra is replaced by a weak Hopf algebra [\cite=Boh]. It is known [\cite=EtiNik:dyn] that weak Hopf algebras are an example of a generalisation of a bialgebra known as an R-bialgebroid [\cite=Lu] or ×  R-bialgebra [\cite=Tak:gro] (and leading to the notion of a Hopf algebroid or a quantum groupoid), introduced in the context of Poisson geometry, algebraic topology and classification of algebras. It seems therefore natural to ask whether a definition of a Doi-Koppinen datum in which a bialgebra is replaced by an R-bialgebroid is possible. In this paper we propose such a definition and by this means introduce the notion of a Doi-Koppinen module over a noncommutative algebra R. We show that Doi-Koppinen modules for a weak Hopf algebra are a special case thus providing a new, more general point of view on weak Doi-Koppinen data and modules.

On the other hand it has been realised in [\cite=Brz:mod] that a natural point of view on Doi-Koppinen data is provided by entwining structures introduced in [\cite=BrzMaj:coa]. The same point of view was adopted in [\cite=CG], where weak entwining structures were introduced in order to describe Doi-Koppinen data for a weak Hopf algebra. Later on it has been shown in [\cite=Brz:cor] that both entwined modules and weak entwined modules are simply comodules of certain corings. Thus various properties of entwined modules such as Frobenius and separability properties discussed first in the case of Doi-Koppinen modules in [\cite=CIMZ] and [\cite=CMZ], can be derived from the properties of comodules over a coring. In the present paper we show that a Doi-Koppinen datum for an R-bialgebroid leads to a certain coring whose comodules are precisely the Doi-Koppinen modules over R.

Preliminaries

Notation

We use the following conventions. For an object V in a category, the identity morphism V  →  V is denoted by V. All rings in this paper have 1, a ring map is assumed to respect 1, and all modules over a ring are assumed to be unital. For a ring R, MR (resp. [formula], [formula]) denotes the category of right R-modules (resp. left R-modules, R-bimodules). The action of R is denoted by a dot between elements.

Throughout the paper k denotes a commutative ring with unit. We assume that all the algebras are over k and unital, and coalgebras are over k and counital. Unadorned tensor product is over k. For a k-coalgebra C we use ΔC to denote the coproduct and εC to denote the counit (we skip subscripts if no confusion is possible). Notation for comodules is similar to that for modules but with subscripts replaced by superscripts, i.e. [formula] is the category of left C-comodules etc. We use the Sweedler notation for coproducts and coactions, i.e. [formula] for a coproduct, and [formula] for a left coaction (summation understood).

Let R be a k-algebra. Recall from [\cite=Swe:pre] that an R-coring is a coalgebra in the monoidal category of R-bimodules [formula], i.e., it is an (R,R)-bimodule C together with (R,R)-bimodule maps [formula] called a coproduct and [formula] called a counit, such that

[formula]

We use the Sweedler notation for the coproduct ΔC too. A left R-module M together with a left R-module map [formula] such that

[formula]

is called a left comodule of the coring C or, simply, a left C-comodule, and [formula] is called a left coaction. A map between left C-comodules is a left R-module map f:M  →  N such that [formula]. The category of left C-comodules is denoted by [formula].

R-rings and bialgebroids

Let R be a k-algebra. Recall from [\cite=Swe:alg], [\cite=Tak:gro] that an R-ring is a pair (U,i), where U is a k-algebra and i:R  →  U is an algebra map. If (U,i) is an R-ring then U is an (R,R)-bimodule with the structure provided by the map i, r  ·  u  ·  r': = i(r)ui(r').

Let R be an algebra and  = Rop the opposite algebra, and let [formula] be the enveloping algebra of R. In case (H,i) is an Re-ring, the map i is necessarily of the form [formula], where sH:R  →  H, tH:  →  H are algebra maps such that sH(a)tH() = tH()sH(a), for all a∈R, ∈, and mH is the product in H. In this case sH is called the source map and tH the target map. [formula] is denoted by (H,sH,tH).

Let (H,sH,tH) be an Re-ring and (A,sA) an R-ring. We view H as an R-bimodule, via r  ·  h  ·  r'  =  sH(r)tH(r')h, and A as an R-bimodule via sA, and define [\cite=Tak:gro]

[formula]

H  ×  RA is an R-ring with product

[formula]

the unit [formula] and the algebra map R  →  H  ×  RA, [formula] (cf. [\cite=Tak:gro]). Taking (A,sA)  =  (H,sH) we can define H  ×  RH which is not only an R-ring but also an Re-ring via [formula], [formula].

Let (H,sH,tH) be an Re-ring. We say that (H,sH,tH,Δ,ε) is an R-bialgebroid iff (H,Δ,ε) is an R-coring such that Im(Δ)  ⊆  H  ×  RH and the corestriction of the coproduct Δ:H  →  H  ×  RH is an algebra map, ε(1H) = 1R, and for all g, h∈H

[formula]

It is shown in [\cite=BM] that this is equivalent both to the definition of a bialgebroid in [\cite=Lu] and that of ×  R-bialgebra in [\cite=Tak:gro].

Szlachányi [\cite=Szl] has reformulated the definition of bialgebroid in terms of monoidal categories and monoidal functors: if H is an Re-ring, then we have the restriction of scalars functor [formula]. H is an R-bialgebroid if and only if there exists a monoidal structure on [formula] such that F is a strict monoidal functor. If (H,sH,tH,Δ,ε) is as in Definition [\ref=def.Lu], then the corresponding monoidal structure on [formula] is given by

[formula]

for all [formula], [formula], a∈R.

Basic examples of R-bialgebroids are provided by Re and End(R), in the case R is finitely generated projective over k (see [\cite=Lu], [\cite=Tak:gro]). In particular any matrix algebra Mn(k) has a structure of an R-bialgebroid with an antipode over any n-dimensional algebra R. We believe, this gives a nice motivation for studying bialgebroids from an algebraic point of view.

Doi-Koppinen datum over a weak Hopf algebra

A weak bialgebra is an algebra and a coalgebra H with multiplicative (but non-unital) coproduct such that for all x,y,z∈H, [formula], and

[formula]

A weak Hopf algebra is a weak bialgebra H with an antipode, i.e., a linear map S:A  →  A such that for all h∈H, [formula], [formula], and [formula]. Weak Hopf algebras have been introduced in [\cite=BohSzl:coa] [\cite=Nil:axi] and studied in connection to integrable models and classification of subfactors of von Neumann algebras. Given a weak Hopf algebra H with bijective antipode, define the maps,

[formula]

Then [\cite=Boh:wea] R: = Im(ΠL) is a subalgebra of H, separable and Frobenius as a k-algebra with the separability idempotent [formula] and the Frobenius pair (e,φ), where φ: = ε. The fact that e is a separability idempotent means explicitly

[formula]

Numerous useful formulae for a weak Hopf algebra were proven in [\cite=Boh:wea]. Although some of them, such as ([\ref=sepide]), were obtained using duality arguments valid only in the finite dimensional case, one can also prove them directly using the axioms of a weak Hopf algebra. The proofs are not always obvious, but quite straightforward once one becomes familiar with these axioms.

Finally, recall from [\cite=Boh] the following

A left-left weak Doi-Koppinen datum is a triple (H,A,C), where H is a weak Hopf algebra and

(1) [formula] is a left weak H-comodule algebra, i.e., A is an algebra and a left H-comodule such that [formula], and [formula], for all a,b∈A;

(2) C is a left weak H-module coalgebra, i.e., C is a coalgebra with counit εC and a left H-module such that [formula], and εC(hg  ·  c) = εH(hg(2))εC(g(1)  ·  c) for all c∈C and h,g∈H.

A (left-left) weak Doi-Koppinen module associated to a weak Doi-Koppinen datum (H,A,C) is a triple [formula], where (M,  ·  ) is a left A-module, [formula] is a left C-comodule, and

[formula]

Note that here [formula] and [formula]. The category of (left-left) weak Doi-Koppinen modules is denoted by [formula].

Morphisms between left weak H-comodule algebras (resp. left weak H-module coalgebras) are defined in the obvious way: they are k-linear maps that are H-colinear (resp. H-linear) algebra (resp. coalgebra) maps. Thus we can consider the categories of left weak H-comodule algebras, left weak H-module coalgebras and left-left weak Doi-Koppinen data over H. The latter is denoted by WDK(H).

Doi-Koppinen modules over algebras

In this section we define the notion of a Doi-Koppinen datum over a noncommutative algebra and we relate it to a weak Doi-Koppinen datum. Our definition is in part motivated by the following important observation [\cite=EtiNik:dyn].

Let H be a weak Hopf algebra with coproduct Δ, counit ε, and bijective antipode S, and let R  =  Im(ΠL). Then H is an R-bialgebroid with the source and target sH, tH:R  →  H given by

[formula]

and the comultiplication [formula] and the counit ε̃:H  →  R given by

[formula]

for all h∈H, where [formula] is the canonical projection.

For the details we refer to [\cite=EtiNik:dyn], we only remark that Im()  ⊆  H  ×  RH can be established from the separability of R as follows. Apply [formula] to ([\ref=sepide]), for an arbitrary h∈H write h = h1H, and use that Δ is multiplicative to obtain

[formula]

We also note that in [\cite=EtiNik:dyn] the conditions ([\ref=25]) are not required for an R-bialgebroid. However it can be easily seen that ε̃ as defined above satisfies equations ([\ref=25]).

There is also a partial converse to Proposition [\ref=webial] (cf. [\cite=Szl]). Suppose H is an R-bialgebroid, where R is a Frobenius and separable k-algebra. Let [formula] (summation understood) be a separability idempotent and let φ:R  →  k be the Frobenius map such that (e,φ) is a Frobenius pair. Then H is a weak bialgebra with the coproduct [formula], [formula], and the counit [formula], where ε:H  →  R is the counit of the R-coring H.

Let (H,sH,tH) be an R-bialgebroid. Then a left H-module coalgebra is a coalgebra C in the monoidal category [formula] of left H-modules.

Recall from [\cite=Szl] that [formula] has a monoidal structure defined as follows. For all [formula], [formula] via [formula]. R is the unit object, when viewed in [formula] via the action

[formula]

Thus, C is a left H-module coalgebra if and only if (C,  ·  ) is a left H-module and (C,ΔC,εC) is an R-coring, where C is viewed as an R-bimodule via r  ·  c  ·  r' = sH(r)tH(r')  ·  c, such that ΔC, εC are left H-modules maps, i.e., for all h∈H and c∈C,

[formula]

A morphism between two H-module coalgebras is an H-linear map of R-corings. We can then consider the category of H-module coalgebras.

(1) (H,ΔH,εH) is a left H-module coalgebra with the left H-action provided by the left multiplication.

(2) View R as an R-coring in the trivial way, i.e., both ΔR and εR are identity maps. Then [formula] is a left H-module coalgebra. Indeed, note that for all r∈R and h∈H we have that [formula] [\cite=BM], and then apply the left R-module map εH to obtain that εH(hsH(r))  =  εH(h(1)sH(r))εH(h(2)). This is equivalent to the fact that ΔR is a left H-linear map.

(3) C = Re is an R-coring with the coproduct [formula] and the counit [formula], and it can be made into a left H-module coalgebra by the H-action [formula]

Let (H,sH,tH) be an R-bialgebroid. A left H-comodule algebra is a triple [formula] where

(1) (A,sA) is an R-ring.

(2) [formula] is a left comodule of the R-coring H.

(3) [formula] and its corestriction [formula] is an algebra map.

A morphism between two H-comodule algebras is a left H-colinear map that is also a morphism of R-rings. A morphism of R-rings is defined in the obvious way. Thus we can consider the category of H-comodule algebras.

(1) (H,sH,Δ) is a left H-comodule algebra.

(2) [formula], where [formula], [formula] is a (trivial) left H-comodule algebra

(3) A = Re is a left H-comodule algebra via [formula], and [formula].

(4) Example (3) can be generalised as follows. For an H-comodule algebra A and an algebra B, [formula] is a left H-comodule algebra with the structures arising from those of A.

(5) An interesting nontrivial example of a comodule algebra of a bialgebroid is constructed in [\cite=Sch:bia]. Let H be a Hopf algebra and let A / B be an H-Galois extension, i.e., A be a right H-comodule algebra with a right coaction [formula], [formula], B  =  AcoH, and the canonical map [formula], [formula] be bijective. Suppose H is k-flat and A is a faithfully flat left B-module. View Ae as a right H-comodule via [formula]. Then the k-module of coinvariants G = (Ae)coH is a subalgebra of Ae and a B-bialgebroid via [formula], [formula], [formula], and [formula]. Furthermore A is a left comodule algebra of the B-bialgebroid G with a left coaction [formula], [formula].

Note that the definition of a left H-comodule algebra is not dual to that of a left H-module coalgebra. The reason is that, although the category of left H-modules is monoidal, the category [formula] of left comodules of an R-coring H is not. Thus there is no way of defining a left H-module algebra as an algebra in the category [formula]. However one can consider more restrictive definition of a left H-comodule M (cf. [\cite=Sch:bia]) by requiring it to be an R-bimodule with an R-bimodule coaction [formula] such that [formula], where

[formula]

The subcategory [formula] of all such comodules is monoidal. For all M, [formula], [formula] via [formula]. Note that the right hand side is well defined because [formula]. R is the unit in [formula] with the trivial coaction [formula]. Furthermore the forgetful functor [formula] is strict monoidal. Now, one could define a left H-comodule algebra as an algebra in the monoidal category [formula]. It appears, however, that this definition is too restrictive to cover the case of a weak Doi-Koppinen datum.

Let (H,sH,tH,Δ,ε) be an R-bialgebroid. Then (H,A,C) is called a (left-left) Doi-Koppinen datum over (an algebra) R if A is a left H-comodule algebra and C is a left H-module coalgebra. Such a datum is denoted by (H,A,C)R. The category of Doi-Koppinen data with H over R is denoted by DKR(H).

A (left-left) Doi-Koppinen module over R (associated to (H,A,C)R) is a triple [formula], where (M,  ·  ) is a left A-module (hence M is a left R-module via sA), [formula] is a left comodule of the R-coring C, and for all a∈A and m∈M,

[formula]

The category of Doi-Koppinen modules associated to (H,A,C)R is denoted by [formula]. Note that the right hand side of ([\ref=comp]) is well defined since [formula].

There are various examples of special cases of the category [formula] obtained by setting A  =  H,R,Re and C  =  H,R,Re. In particular, the category of left H-modules, the category of left H-comodules or the category of (generalised) relative Hopf modules [formula] and its dual [formula] are all special cases of the category [formula].

The main aim of this section is to show that a weak Doi-Koppinen datum in Definition [\ref=def.weakDK] is a special case of a Doi-Koppinen datum over a noncommutative algebra. This provides one with a new point of view on weak Doi-Koppinen modules. In the proof of the next two Propositions, we will make use of the following remark.

If S is a separable k-algebra with an idempotent [formula] (summation understood), and M and N are S-bimodules then the canonical projection [formula] has a section

[formula]

If H is a weak Hopf algebra, then H is a bialgebroid over a separable (and Frobenius) algebra R with idempotent [formula] and the Frobenius map φ:R  →  k, φ: = ε, the restriction of a weak counit of H to R.

Let H be a weak Hopf algebra viewed as an R-bialgebroid as in Proposition [\ref=webial]. Then the category of left weak H-comodule algebras (in the sense of Definition [\ref=def.weakDK]) and of left comodule algebras over the bialgebroid H (in the sense of Definition [\ref=lhca]) are isomorphic to each other.

1) Let A be a left H-comodule algebra. We will show that A is then a left comodule algebra over the R-bialgebroid H. Note that

[formula]

where ε:H  →  k is a weak counit, is a well-defined algebra map. Indeed, suppose r = ΠL(h) = 0. This means that ε(1(1)h)1(2) = 0, and therefore

[formula]

Note that the second equality was obtained by using the following observation made in [\cite=CG]. The unit property of a coaction of a weak comodule algebra in Definition [\ref=def.weakDK](1) is equivalent to

[formula]

This proves that sA is well-defined. To prove that sA is an algebra map we require the following two equalities (cf. [\cite=Boh:wea] and [\cite=Boh] respectively). For all g,h∈H and a∈A,

[formula]

Now for all r = ΠL(h), s = ΠL(g) we have

[formula]

where [formula] denotes another copy of [formula], and [\cite=Boh:wea] has been used to derive the second equality and the unit property in Definition [\ref=def.weakDK] (1) to obtain the fourth one. This proves that sA is an algebra map and hence (A,sA) is an R-ring.

Next, using the canonical projection [formula] define a map [formula], [formula], where [formula] is the left coaction of a weak Hopf algebra. Explicitly, [formula]. The map [formula] is left R-linear since using equation ([\ref=64]) and the fact that A is a comodule algebra we have for all r = ΠL(h)∈R and a∈A

[formula]

Then it is clear that [formula]. We prove now that Im()  ⊆  H  ×  RA. Equation ([\ref=2.31a]) implies that for all g∈H and a∈A

[formula]

Apply [formula] to the last equality to obtain

[formula]

Using equations (2.2a),(2.2b) in [\cite=Boh:wea] which, put together, state that for all g,h∈H, ε(gΠL(h))  =  ε(ΠR(g)h) we compute

[formula]

Hence we have proved that

[formula]

In particular, Im()  ⊆  H  ×  RA as required. It remains to be proven that [formula]. Using the unit property of a comodule algebra of a weak Hopf algebra in Definition [\ref=def.weakDK](1) we compute

[formula]

Since A is a left R-module via sA we obtain

[formula]

This completes the proof that (A,sA,) is a left H-comodule algebra over the R-bialgebroid H.

If [formula] is a morphism of left H-comodule algebras, then [formula] is also a morphism of left H-comodule algebras over the R-bialgebroid H. In view of the definition of [formula], the left H-colinearity is obvious. We also know that f is an algebra map, so f is a map of R-rings if [formula]. Using the H-colinearity of f and the fact that f(1A) = 1B, we find

[formula]

2) Conversely, let [formula] be a left comodule algebra over the bialgebroid H as in Definition [\ref=lhca]. We prove that A is a weak left H-comodule algebra with coaction given by [formula]. Explicitly

[formula]

where we used that H is a right R-module via the target map tH  =  S- 1|R. The fact that (A,) is a left comodule of a weak Hopf algebra H can easily be established with the help of equations ([\ref=weak.unit]). We prove now that [formula] is an algebra map. First, since [formula] we have for all r∈R and a∈A,

[formula]

Applying the section σ we obtain

[formula]

On the other hand, application of σ to an expression reflecting the fact that [formula] is an algebra map leads to equality

[formula]

Noting that tH = S- 1|R and writing [formula] for another copy of [formula] we have

[formula]

i.e., [formula] is multiplicative as required. It remains to prove the unit property of the weak coaction [formula]. Since [formula] we obtain that

[formula]

hence the unit property of [formula] is equivalent to the following equation

[formula]

It is known, however, that

[formula]

for [formula] is a comodule algebra of an R-bialgebroid. Application of f yields

[formula]

Next apply [formula] to the preceding equality to obtain

[formula]

Now the required condition follows from these two equations, and equation ([\ref=weak.unit]). Thus we conclude that (A,) is a left weak H-comodule algebra.

Suppose now that [formula] is a morphism of left H-comodule algebras over the R-bialgebroid H. Then f is an algebra map, and

[formula]

Applying σ to both sides, we obtain

[formula]

f is a map of left R-modules, so the left hand side equals [formula], and this means that [formula] is left H-colinear, and f is a morphism of left H-comodule algebras.

3) We still need to show that the functors constructed in parts 1) and 2) of the proof are inverses to each other. First, let (A,ρ) be a left weak H-comodule algebra. It is first transformed into a left H-comodule algebra [formula] over the bialgebroid R, and then into a left weak H-comodule algebra [formula]. We easily compute that

[formula]

as needed. We used Definition [\ref=def.weakDK] (1).

Conversely, we start with a left H-comodule algebra (A,ρ,sA) over the bialgebroid R, transform it into a weak left H-comodule algebra [formula] using part 2), and then back into [formula] over R. We have to show that [formula] and [formula]. We write [formula], and then easily find that

[formula]

Using equation ([\ref=Gigel]), we obtain

[formula]

Let H be a weak Hopf algebra viewed as an R-bialgebroid as in Proposition [\ref=webial]. The categories of left weak H-module coalgebras (in the sense of Definition [\ref=def.weakDK]) and of left module coalgebras over the bialgebroid H (in the sense of Definition [\ref=altadef]) are isomorphic to each other.

1) Let (C,ΔC,εC) be a left weak H-module coalgebra and define [formula], [formula] and ε̃C:C  →  R, c  ↦  εC(1(1)  ·  c)1(2). We will show that these maps make C into a left module coalgebra of the R-bialgebroid H.

Since ΔC is left H-linear, so is C. This implies that C is an R-bimodule map. Next we prove that ε̃C is left H-linear. First note that setting g = 1H in Definition [\ref=def.weakDK] (2) one immediately obtains [formula] for all h∈H, c∈C. In particular

[formula]

where [formula] is another copy of Δ(1H) and ε̃H:H  →  R is the counit of H as an R-bialgebroid. This implies that ε̃C is an R-bimodule map. Clearly, C is a coproduct and ε̃C is a counit of an R-coring C. The compatibility of C with the left action of H on C follows immediately from the fact that C is a weak module coalgebra. Thus we conclude that C is a left module coalgebra over the R-bialgebroid H as claimed.

Let f: (C,ΔC,εC)  →  (D,ΔD,εD) be a morphism of left weak H-module coalgebras. Then f is left H-linear, and it clearly preserves the comultiplication over R. Furthermore

[formula]

and we conclude that [formula] is a morphism of left H-module coalgebras over the R-bialgebroid H.

2) Conversely, assume that C is a left module coalgebra over the R-bialgebroid H, in the sense of Definition [\ref=altadef]. We claim that C is a left weak H-module coalgebra with the coproduct

[formula]

(note that here [formula] while [formula]), and the counit ε̃C:C  →  k, c  ↦  φ(εC(c)), where εC:C  →  R is the counit of the R-coring C and φ:R  →  k is the Frobenius map φ: = ε, the restriction of the counit of a weak Hopf algebra H to the Frobenius algebra R. This claim can be proven by a fairly straightforward calculation and hence details of the proof are left to the reader.

Let f: (C,ΔC,εC)  →  (D,ΔD,εD) be a morphism of left H-module coalgebras over the bialgebroid H. Then f is left H-linear and

[formula]

and

[formula]

so that f is also a morphism in the category of weak left H-module coalgebras.

3) We finally prove that the functors constructed in parts 1 and 2 of the proof are inverses to each other. First we take a left weak H-module coalgebra (C,ΔC,εC), turn it into a left module coalgebra [formula] over the bialgebroid H, and then back into a left weak H-module coalgebra [formula]. Using Remark [\ref=separableremark], we find

[formula]

and

[formula]

Finally take a left module coalgebra (C,ΔC,εC) over the bialgebroid H, make it into a weak left H-module coalgebra [formula], and then back into a left module coalgebra [formula] over the bialgebroid H. Obviously

[formula]

Proving [formula] is slightly more complicated. Recall that ε: H  →  k is the counit of the weak Hopf algebra H, and εH  =  ΠL: H  →  R is the counit of the R-bialgebroid H. Take c∈C, and write εC(c) = ΠL(g)∈R, for some g∈H. Observe that ε(ΠL(g)) = ε(g) and [formula], and compute

[formula]

this completes the proof.

Combining Propositions [\ref=comodulealgebra] and [\ref=modulecoalgebra], we immediately obtain the following theorem, which is the main result of this Section. We leave it to the reader to define morphisms between left-left weak Doi-Koppinen data, and between left-left Doi-Koppinen data over an algebra R.

Let H be a weak Hopf algebra, and view it also as an R-bialgebroid, as in Proposition [\ref=webial]. Then there is an isomorphism of categories [formula]. Furthermore, the corresponding categories of Doi-Koppinen modules are isomorphic.

A coring associated to a Doi-Koppinen datum over R and applications

In this section we construct an A-coring corresponding to a given Doi-Koppinen datum (H,A,C)R over R. This allows one to use methods employed in [\cite=Brz:cor] to derive various properties of Doi-Koppinen modules over an algebra.

Let (H,A,C)R be a Doi-Koppinen datum over R. Then [formula] is an A-bimodule with the right action given by the multiplication in A and the left action [formula], for all a,a'∈A, c∈C. Furthermore C is an A-coring with comultiplication [formula] and the counit [formula], where ΔC, εC are the coproduct and the counit of the R-coring C. In this case the categories of left C-comodules and of left-left Doi-Koppinen modules over R are isomorphic to each other.

First note that the left action of A on C is well-defined since the image of the left H-coaction of A is required to be in A  ×  RH. The fact that it is an action indeed follows from the fact that A is a left H-comodule algebra. Note also that in the definitions of [formula] and [formula] we used the natural isomorphisms [formula] and [formula] respectively. Clearly [formula] is a right A-module map. To prove that it is a left A-module map as well take any a,a'∈A and c∈C and compute

[formula]

where we used that C is a left H-module coalgebra. On the other hand

[formula]

This proves that [formula] is right A-linear, hence it is an A-bimodule map as required. Directly from the definition of ΔC it follows that it is coassociative.

It is clear that [formula] is right A-linear. To prove that it is also a left A-module morphism take any a,a'∈A, c∈C and compute

[formula]

where we used that C is a left H-module coalgebra to obtain the second equality, then equation ([\ref=25]) to derive the third one and the fact that the image of the left coaction of H on A is in H  ×  RA to obtain the fourth equality. This proves that εC is left A-linear hence it is A-bilinear. The fact that εC is a counit of C follows directly from the definition of εC. Thus we conclude that C is an A-coring as stated.

To prove the isomorphism of categories, take any left C-comodule (M,ρ) and view it as a Doi-Koppinen module via the same coaction [formula]. Conversely, any Doi-Koppinen module (M,  ·  ,ρ) can be viewed as a left C comodule via [formula].

One can now use the general results about corings in [\cite=Brz:cor] combined with Proposition [\ref=prop.coring] to derive various properties of Doi-Koppinen modules over a noncommutative algebra R. For example [\cite=Brz:cor] implies that the forgetful functor [formula] is the left adjoint of the induction functor [formula]. Furthermore by [\cite=Brz:cor] one has

Let (H,A,C)R be a left-left Doi-Koppinen datum over R.

(1) The induction functor [formula] is separable if and only if there exists [formula] such that [formula] and for all a∈A, [formula].

(2) The forgetful functor [formula] is separable if and only if there exists a right R-bimodule map [formula] such that for all a∈A and c,c'∈C,

[formula].

Finally, it has been observed in [\cite=Brz:cor], that given a weak entwining structure (A,C,ψ), and hence a weak Doi-Koppinen datum in particular, one can construct a coring obtained as an image of certain projection in [formula]. Since a weak Doi-Koppinen datum is a special case of a Doi-Koppinen datum over R it is important to study the relationship of this coring to [formula].

Let (H,A,C) be weak Doi-Koppinen datum. Define the corresponding A-coring [formula], with the coproduct [formula] and the counit [formula]. View (H,A,C) as a Doi-Koppinen datum over R = ImΠL in Theorem [\ref=thm.weak-r]. Then [formula] as A-corings.

Consider two maps θ:C  →  , [formula], and :  →  C, [formula]. The map θ is well-defined because using equation ([\ref=eq.sep]) we have for all a∈A, c∈C and r∈R  =  ImΠL,

[formula]

Clearly, θ is a right A-module map. Recall from [\cite=Brz:cor] that [formula] is a left A-module via [formula]. Now, the fact that A is a weak left H-comodule algebra implies that θ is a left A-module map. Thus θ is an A-bimodule map. To prove that θ is a coring map take any a∈A, c∈C and use the fact that A is an H-comodule algebra to compute

[formula]

where [formula] is another copy of [formula]. On the other hand, using the fact that C is a left H-module coalgebra we have

[formula]

as required. Thus we have proven that θ is a map of A-corings. We now prove that [formula] is an inverse of θ. For a typical element [formula] of [formula] we have

[formula]

for A is a weak H-module algebra. On the other hand, since [formula] (cf. proof of Theorem [\ref=thm.weak-r]) we have for all a∈A, c∈C

[formula]

This completes the proof that θ is an isomorphism of A-corings.
