Introduction

Let X be a normal projective complex surface with at worst Kawamata log terminal singularities (klt singularities) and [formula]. By the classification of surfaces, X is either an Abelian surface, a hyperelliptic surface, a K3 surface with only rational double points (RDPs), an Enriques surface with only RDPs or a log Enriques surface. Here a log Enriques surface (compare Zhang [\cite=Zhang]) is a rational normal projective surface with at worst klt singularities and [formula].

The aim of this paper is to study the 2-dimensional klt analogue of the following conjecture of Morrison:

Let V be a Calabi-Yau manifold, A(V) its ample cone, and A'(V) the convex hull of its rational ample cone [formula]. Then there exists a rational polyhedral cone Δ  ⊂  A'(V) such that [formula].

Our main result is as follows:

Let X be a normal projective complex surface with at worst klt singularities and [formula]. Then there exists a rational finite polyhedral cone Δ which is a fundamental domain for the action of [formula] on A'(X) in the sense that

[formula],

[formula] unless [formula].

This conjecture is known for a smooth Abelian variety (Kawamata [\cite=k2]) or a smooth K3 surface (Sterk [\cite=sterk]). Our new result covers the remaining cases.

The plan of the proof is as follows: for X as in Theorem [\ref=th!main], write I = I(X) for the (global) index of X, that is, the smallest positive integer such that IKX is Cartier and linearly equivalent to zero and [formula] for the (global) index one cover of X. Then π:Y  →  X is a Galois finite cover with Galois group [formula], and g*(ωY) = ζIωY, where ωY is a generator of H0(OY(KY)) and ζI a primitive Ith root of 1. It is known that Y  →  X is etale in codimension 1, so that G admits no pointwise fixed curve. Since Y is a projective surface with only RDPs and OY(KY)≃OY, it is either a projective K3 surface with only RDPs or a smooth Abelian surface. We treat log Enriques surfaces according to this case division.

In Section 1, we consider the case where the global index one cover Y is an Abelian surface. In this case the theorem follows from Kawamata's result [\cite=k2] and the Torelli theorem for Abelian surface (Shioda [\cite=shioda]). In the course of the proof, we also classify log Enriques surfaces whose index one cover is an Abelian surface. Section 2 considers the case where Y is a K3 surface with at worst RDPs. In this case, we use the equivariant version of Torelli theorem (Oguiso and Sakurai [\cite=sakurai]) and Morrison's weakly polarized global Torelli theorem for K3 surfaces [\cite=M]. Our result Theorem [\ref=th!K3] is slightly stronger than we need.

The case where the index one cover is an Abelian surface

Assume first that X is an Abelian surface. In this case, we obtain the result at once from the following theorem.

Assume that X is an Abelian surface. Then, there exists a finite rational polyhedral cone Δ which is a fundamental domain for the action of [formula] on A'(X) in the sense that

[formula],

[formula] unless [formula].

The case of a hyperelliptic surface X is trivial: Since ρ(X) = 2 and X is spanned by its two elliptic fibrations, each of which is invariant under [formula].

Next, consider the case of a log Enriques surface X whose index one cover Y is a smooth Abelian surface.

Let X be a log Enriques surface whose index one cover [formula] is an Abelian surface. Then Y  →  X is isomorphic to one of the following two cases:

Y = E2ζ3 and [formula]; here Eζ3 is the elliptic curve with multiplication by ζ3. Or

Y =  the Jacobian surface J(C) of the genus two curve C:y2 = x5 - 1, and the automorphism g5 of order 5 is induced by the automorphism (x,y)  ↦  (ζ5x,y) of C.

Our proof of Proposition [\ref=prop1] is similar to Oguiso [\cite=type3].

Let X be a log Enriques surface whose index one cover [formula] is an Abelian surface. Then

[formula] or 5;

[formula] is isomorphic to [formula] if I = 3;

[formula] is isomorphic to [formula] if I = 5.

Write Y as V / Λ, where [formula] and Λ is a discrete [formula]-submodule of V of rank 4. Since G does not have any nonzero translations, [formula] has a fixed point:

Since [formula], in suitable coordinates, we can write

[formula]

Since g is of finite order, we may take A as a diagonal matrix [formula].

It suffices to show that [formula]. We derive a contradition from the assumption α = 1. Recall that [formula]. Then there exists [formula] such that [formula]. We can write

[formula]

Let [formula]. Then x = x + b1 leads to b1 = 0. Thus the curve (y = 0) in Y is contained in [formula]. This contradicts the fact that [formula] is a finite set.

Since Y is an Abelian surface, there exist global coordinates (x,y) of Y centered at a fixed point of g such that g*(x,y) = (ax,by). Recall that g*ωY  =  ζIωY, where [formula] and [formula] is a finite set. Then we have [formula] for some integers k1 and k2 where each ki is coprime to I.

Let [formula] be the group algebra of the cyclic group [formula] over [formula]. Clearly, [formula]. The action of g on V defines a natural [formula]-module structure on Λ: [formula].

Write ΦI(x) for the Ith cyclotomic polynomial. Since [formula] and Λ is a torsion free [formula]-module. This also holds for V.

Tensoring with [formula] the tower of modules [formula], gives the tower of vector spaces [formula]. Then we get [formula], where φ is the Euler function. Thus, φ(d) is either 2 or 4. Combining this with the fact I is not divisible by 2 ([\cite=Zhang]), we get I is either 3 or 5.

For the case of I = 3, we have g*ωY  =  ζ3ωY. Therefore ab = ζ3. We also see that a and b must be roots of unity. Recall that neither a nor b is 1. Thus, we conclude that (a,b) = (ζ23,ζ23). Changing the generator by g to g2, we obtain g*(x,y) = (ζ3x,ζ3y). Since V is the direct sum of some eigenspaces corresponding to the indicated eigenvalues of the action of [formula] on the space [formula], Λ must be a free [formula]-module of rank 4 / φ(I). This gives [formula].

Next we consider the eigenspace decomposition:

[formula]

where V(m) denotes the eigenspace of the eigenvalue ζmI. In our case, we obtain the following φI-equivariant eigenspace decompositions:

[formula]

Therefore we have [formula]. In particular, [formula].

If I = 5, then the same argument gives (a,b) = (ζ35,ζ35), (ζ25,ζ45) or (ζ45,ζ25). Changing the generator again, we obtain g*(x,y) = (ζ5x,ζ5y), (ζ5x,ζ25y). However the first case cannot happen because [formula]. Therefore, g*(x,y) = (ζ5x,ζ25y). Then in a similar way we have [formula].

Since [formula] and [formula], we have [formula] and [formula]. This gives the result.

In the rest of the proof X is a log Enriques surface; the proof reduces to solving the following proposition, with Y  →  X the index one cover of X and g a generator of the Galois group:

There exists a finite rational polyhedral cone Δ' inside A'(Y) such that [formula].

We need the following theorem due to Shioda:

Let Y and Y' be Abelian surfaces over [formula], and let

[formula]

be an isomorphism of Euclidean lattices. Denote the period map of Y (resp. Y') by [formula] (resp. [formula]). Then the necessary and sufficient condition for the isomorphism φ or -  φ to be induced by an isomorphism f:Y'  →  Y is that φ satisfies the following conditions:

det φ =  + 1, and

[formula] (that is, φ preserves the periods).

If I = 3, we take a basis of [formula] as [formula] for i = 1,2, E1  =  Δ and E2  =  Γf, where [formula] are the projections, Δ denotes the diagonal and Γf is the graph of f:Eζ3  →  Eζ3 induced by p  ↦  ζ3p. Then the action of g on [formula] is trivial and Theorem [\ref=kawamata] and Theorem [\ref=shioda1] give the result immediately.

In the case I = 5, from g*ω  =  ζ5ω, the eigenvalues of g on TY are ζ5,ζ25,ζ35 and ζ45, and T is the minimal lattice which contains 2-form ω. Then we have [formula]. Since [formula], we have [formula] and the action of g on [formula] is trivial. Thus Theorem [\ref=kawamata] and Theorem [\ref=shioda1] again give the result.

By the reduction theory and explicit calculation, in the case I = 3 we have

[formula]

as Δ, under the identification

[formula]

.

The case where the index one cover is a K3 surface with only RDPs

In this section, we prove the following Theorem [\ref=th!K3], which is slightly stronger than necessary for the main result. Indeed, we obtain Theorem [\ref=th!main] as a corollary on taking G as the Galois group of the index one cover and applying Theorem [\ref=th!K3].

Let A'(Y) be the convex hull of the rational ample cone of Y, and A(Y)G be its G-fixed part. [formula].

Let Y be a K3 surface with only RDPs and G a finite subgroup of [formula]. Then there exists a finite rational polyhedral cone Δ' which is a fundamental domain for the action of [formula] on A'(Y)G in the sense that

[formula],

[formula] unless [formula].

Let ν:Z  →  Y be the minimal resolution of Y and [formula] the exceptional divisor. From now, we mainly work on Z.

Our proof proceeds on similar lines to Oguiso and Sakurai [\cite=sakurai]. We first fix the notation adopted in our argument below.

From the uniqueness of the minimal resolution, we have the natural automorphism of Z which corresponds to g. We denote this by g again. Let [formula]. We set

[formula]

[formula] is the positive cone of X, that is, the connected component of the space [formula] containing the ample classes.

C' is the union of [formula] and all [formula]-rational rays in the boundary [formula] of [formula].

C: = (C')G;

[formula];

[formula] the orthogonal group of the lattice S' which preserves the positive cone C.

O(S)+: =  the set of [formula] that are Hodge isometries of [formula] and extend to Hodge isometries of [formula] satisfying [formula] for all g∈G (the last condition implies σ(S) = S);

[formula];

[formula]

In other words, P(S)+ is the image of the group homomorphism of QZ  →  P(S) which maps from f to [formula]; this implies that σ(A) = A for each τ∈P(S)+.

Then we have the following:

S is an even hyperbolic lattice if [formula].

The interior [formula] of A consists of the G-invariant ample classes of Y and is nonempty. Moreover, [formula].

Set [formula]. Then [formula] with each inclusion of finite index.

The assertions (1), (2) are clear. The last statement (3) comes from the fact that

[formula]

and [formula] is a finite group. We need to show that O(S)+  +  ⊂  O(S)+, that is, if τ∈O(S)+  + then τ∈O(S)+. Since [formula], [formula]. This is a Hodge isometry of [formula]. Set [formula]. Then σ preserves the Hodge structure and satisfies (σ(z)  ·  σ(w)) = (z  ·  w) for [formula]. Therefore σ is a Hodge isometry of [formula]. Moreover, since [formula] on S, and [formula] on T, we have [formula] on [formula]. This shows τ∈O(S)+.

Next we consider the reflection over S: set

[formula]

and

[formula]

Then every C∈N induces a reflection rC on [formula] by rC(D) = D + (D  ·  C)C. This is a Hodge isometry.

Set [formula], where Γ' is the set of all reflection rC for C∈N. For this Γ, we have Γ  ⊂  O(S)+  + and the cone A is a fundamental domain for the action Γ on C.

Recall the weakly polarized global Torelli theorem:

Let Y and Y' be K3 surfaces with weak polarization, and ρ:Z  →  Y, ρ':Z'  →  Y' their minimal resolutions. Suppose that [formula] is an isometry preserving the Hodge structure such that φ(A(Y)) = A(Y'), which extends to an isometry [formula]. Then there is a unique isomorphism Φ:Y≃Y' such that Φ*  =  φ.

[formula]

To show that Γ is a normal subgroup of [formula], we check that for each τ∈P(S)+ and C∈N, there exists an element C'∈N such that [formula]. We have τ = f* for some f∈QZ then we have:

[formula]

In addition, (f- 1)*z∈N and [formula]. Therefore, we may take C' = (f- 1)*C.

Assume that [formula] for some γ,γ'∈Γ and τ,τ'∈P(S)+. Take [formula]. Since γ''(A) = A, we have [formula]. This shows that [formula].

To show that [formula], we take [formula], [formula] and set τ(y) = x. By Lemma [\ref=os1.3], (3), there exists rC∈Γ such that [formula]. Since S is an even hyperbolic lattice by Lemma [\ref=os1.3], (1), [formula]. Then there exists a Hodge isometry ρ of [formula] such that [formula] and [formula] for all g∈G. Recall that P(S)+ is the image of the homomorphism [formula]. From Theorem [\ref=torelli], there exists [formula] such that f = ρ. Moreover [formula] for all g∈G by Theorem [\ref=torelli] again. Hence f∈QZ and [formula]. Clearly, [formula]. So we have [formula]. Then we get the result.

Γ is a normal subgroup of O(S)+ and

[formula]

To prove the first part of the statement, we have only to do with the same line of Lemma [\ref=lem4.4].

It is clear that [formula]. To show [formula], take the element [formula] corresponds to the element of [formula] and this leads to an element of [formula] by taking restriction. So, applying Theorem [\ref=torelli] for the pairs (Y,y) and [formula], we have the element of [formula] which comes from the element of [formula]. Then we conclude that [formula] by Lemma [\ref=lem4.4].

By Theorem [\ref=mainthm], P(S)+  ·  A  =  A, and C  =  Γ  ·  A, we find that Δ' is the required fundamental domain.
