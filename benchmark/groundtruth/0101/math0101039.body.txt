Doubles of (quasi) Hopf algebras and some examples of quantum groupoids and vertex groups related to them

Introduction

Let A be a finite dimensional Hopf algebra, [formula] its Drinfel'd double and H(A) = A  #  A* its Heisenberg double. The relation between D(A) and H(A) has been found by J.-H. Lu in [\cite=lu1] (see also [\cite=mon], p. 196): the multiplication of H(A) may be obtained by twisting the multiplication of D(A)* by a certain left 2-cocycle which in turn is obtained from the R-matrix of D(A). It was also obtained in [\cite=lu1] that H(A) becomes a left D(A)-module algebra under a certain action of D(A) on H(A) (formula (35) in [\cite=lu1]).       All these may be obtained alternatively using a more direct approach, which also shows that the above mentioned action of D(A) on H(A) is manifestly the left regular action of D(A) on D(A)* (by identifying H(A) and D(A)* as linear spaces). The general setting is the following: if (H,R) is a quasitriangular bialgebra and we define a new multiplication on H* by [formula], then H* with this new multiplication (denoted in what follows by H*R) becomes a left H-module algebra under the left regular action [formula] (this is well-known, see also [\cite=ae], [\cite=maj3], [\cite=gz], [\cite=bpvo] for some more general versions in terms of Drinfel'd twists). Although very simple, this construction may have some nice applications, for instance H*R may be noncommutative even if H was cocommutative-  it was discovered recently in [\cite=w1], [\cite=w2] that an important algebra arising in noncommutative string theory is an example of this type; this discovery has also been applied to noncommutative quantum field theory in [\cite=o]. And, if A is a finite dimensional Hopf algebra and H = D(A), then H*R is just H(A).       For reasons to be discussed below, we were not satisfied with the description of H*R as a left H-module algebra and we were led to consider also the right regular action of H on H*R. It turns out that H*R is a right Hcop-module algebra (that is, the right action satisfies a "reversed Leibniz rule"), so H*R is an algebra in the tensor category of H - Hcop-bimodules (we say that it is an H - Hcop-bimodule algebra). If we endow this category with the braiding given by multiplying to the left by R21 (as usual) and from the right by R- 1, we shall prove that H*R is quantum commutative as an algebra in this braided tensor category (which is also equivalent to saying that H*R is a quantum commutative left [formula]-module algebra). In particular H(A) is a quantum commutative D(A) - D(A)cop-bimodule algebra and we like to think of this as the most natural "tensor categorical" interpretation of the Heisenberg double.       In section 4 we discuss some more facts about H*R, Drinfel'd doubles and Heisenberg doubles. For instance, we discuss the relation between the multiplication of H*R and Majid's "covariantised product" and, for a finite dimensional Hopf algebra A, we give a formula for the canonical element [formula], solution to the pentagon equation, in terms of the R-matrix of D(A) and the map Q expressing the factorizability of D(A) (the formula is: [formula]; unfortunately this formula does not seem to offer an answer to the following natural question: is there an "explanation", in terms of the structure of the Drinfel'd double only, for the fact that W is a solution to the pentagon equation on the Heisenberg double?).       In section 5 we speak about quantum groupoids. The general concepts of bialgebroid and Hopf algebroid (=quantum groupoid) have been introduced by J.-H. Lu in [\cite=lu2], with inspiration and motivation coming from Poisson geometry and by generalizing previous ones ([\cite=rav], [\cite=mal]) where the base algebra was assumed to be commutative (we refer to [\cite=en], [\cite=nv], [\cite=sch], [\cite=bm] for discussions concerning the relation between these concepts and other objects known as "quantum groupoids", such as weak Hopf algebras [\cite=bns] and Takeuchi's ×  R-bialgebras [\cite=tak]). In [\cite=lu2] Lu proved that if A is a finite dimensional Hopf algebra and V is a quantum commutative left D(A)-module algebra then V  #  A is a Hopf algebroid over V, and that A* is a quantum commutative left D(A)-module algebra, so that H(A*) is a quantum groupoid over A*. We would like to obtain a quantum groupoid having H(A) as base, and we proceed as follows: first we generalize Lu's theorem, by proving that if (H,R) is any quasitriangular Hopf algebra and V is a quantum commutative left H-module algebra then V  #  R(l) is a quantum groupoid over V, where R(l) is a certain finite dimensional Hopf subalgebra of H (Radford's notation). Then, if A is a finite dimensional Hopf algebra, H(A) is a quantum commutative D(A) - D(A)cop-bimodule algebra, hence it is a quantum commutative left [formula]-module algebra so that the above result may be applied and we obtain a Hopf algebroid with H(A) as base and [formula] as total algebra.       Let us mention that a generalization of Lu's theorem has been independently obtained also very recently in [\cite=bm].       In section 6 we give a slight generalization of the concept of "vertex group" introduced by Richard Borcherds in his recent (partly Hopf-algebraic) approach to vertex algebras (see [\cite=b1], [\cite=b2]), by allowing the "ring of singular functions" to be noncommutative. With this terminology, we prove that if A is a finite dimensional cocommutative Hopf algebra, then H(A) has some properties making it a vertex group over A. These properties are natural from the Hopf-algebraic point of view, but we do not know whether this example may be relevant for the theory of vertex algebras.       Now, we come back to our starting point, namely the construction of H*R. We have tried to perform it for quasi-bialgebras H instead of bialgebras, the multiplication on H* being defined by the same formula. Naturally, this multiplication is not associative in general, but surprisingly H*R is also not, in general, an algebra in the tensor category of left H-modules, as for bialgebras. We have tried to find a tensor category in which H*R lives as an algebra, and we found the category of H - Hcop-bimodules. So, in section 2, the construction and properties of H*R are given directly for quasi-bialgebras. This greater generality not only indicates what is the most natural tensor-categorical interpretation for the case of bialgebras, but, in view of the fact that H(A) = D(A)*R for Hopf algebras, suggests a possible definition for the Heisenberg double of a finite dimensional quasi-Hopf algebra A, as D(A)*R, where D(A) is the quantum double of A introduced in [\cite=maj2], [\cite=hn1], [\cite=hn2]. In section 7 we compute explicitly this D(A)*R for the case when D(A) is a slight generalization of the Dijkgraaf-Pasquier-Roche quasi-Hopf algebra Dω(G) introduced in [\cite=dpr].       This definition of the Heisenberg double as a non - associative algebra (but which is an algebra in a certain tensor category) may seem rather strange, so let us mention that such non-associative algebras occur naturally in the literature on quasi-Hopf algebras, in various contexts such as smash products ([\cite=bpvo]), cohomology and deformation theory ([\cite=ms], [\cite=ss])) and algebraic quantum field theory ([\cite=mack]). A somehow dual situation appears in [\cite=am1], [\cite=am2], where it was proposed, as a general philosophy, to try to study non-associative algebras by expressing them, when possible, as algebras in certain tensor categories (especially ones associated to quasi-Hopf algebras). For instance, the octonions and higher Cayley algebras may be studied in this framework, see [\cite=am1].

Preliminaries

In this section, we recall some definitions and fix the notation that will be used in the rest of the paper. Throughout, k will be a fixed field and all algebras, linear spaces etc. will be over k; unadorned [formula] means [formula]. For coalgebras and Hopf algebras, we shall use the framework of [\cite=sw2]; in particular, for coalgebras, we shall use Σ  -  notation: [formula], [formula], etc.       Let us note that every Hopf algebra with bijective antipode is a quasi-Hopf algebra with [formula] and α  =  β = 1.       We note the following two consequences of the definitions of S,α,β: ε(α)ε(β) = 1, [formula]. Moreover, the axioms imply that [formula].       If R satisfies these conditions it is called an R - matrix. From these relations one can deduce the quasi-Yang-Baxter equation:

[formula]

Also, it is easy to see that:

[formula]

As a general rule, the tensor components of the associator Φ of a quasi-bialgebra will be denoted using big letters, for instance

[formula]

and the ones of Φ- 1 with small letters, for instance

[formula]

An R-matrix will be usually denoted by

[formula]

If (H,R) is a quasitriangular Hopf algebra and B is a left H-module algebra (i.e. an algebra in the tensor category H - mod) then B is called quantum  commutative in [\cite=cw] if it is commutative as algebra in the braided tensor category of left H-modules, i.e. if [formula] for all b,b'∈B. We extend this terminology and we call quantum  commutative any algebra B in a braided tensor category which is commutative with respect to the braiding c of the category, namely [formula] where mB is the multiplication of B.

The main result for quasi-bialgebras

Let H be a quasi-bialgebra and denote by Hl, Hr and Hlr the categories of left H-modules, right H-modules and H-bimodules respectively. In these categories we introduce tensor products, as follows. If V,W∈Hl then [formula] with [formula]. If V,W∈Hr then [formula] with [formula]. If V,W∈Hlr then [formula] with [formula].       It is well-known (see [\cite=kass], Chapter XV) that Hl with the above tensor product becomes a tensor category, with associativity constraints given by

[formula]

[formula]

for all U,V,W∈Hl. Similarly one can prove that Hr and Hlr become also tensor categories, with associativity constraints given by

[formula]

[formula]

for U,V,W∈Hr and U,V,W∈Hlr respectively (the unit constraints are the usual ones).       Suppose now that (H,R) is a quasitriangular quasi-bialgebra. It is well-known (see [\cite=kass]) that the tensor category Hl is braided, the braiding being given by

[formula]

[formula]

for V,W∈Hl. Similarly one can prove that Hr and Hlr become also braided tensor categories, the braidings being given by

[formula]

[formula]

for V,W∈Hr and V,W∈Hlr respectively, where [formula] is the inverse of R.       Suppose again that (H,R) is a quasitriangular quasi-bialgebra and consider the left and right regular actions of H on H*, that is [formula], [formula], for p∈H* and h,h'∈H. Obviously H* is an H-bimodule with these actions.       On H* we can consider the convolution product, given by [formula] (which is not associative in general). We introduce another product in H*, given by

[formula]

which is also not associative in general. Denote by H*R the pair (H*,  ·  ). Then we have the following Proof: for f,g∈H*, the product f  ·  g is given by:

[formula]

for all h∈H. We shall prove first b). We calculate: [formula] (using the relation Δcop(h)R = RΔ(h)) [formula]       Now we prove a). We have: [formula] [formula] using again the relation Δcop(h)R = RΔ(h).       For the second relation, we calculate: [formula] (using the relation [formula], where [formula]) [formula] using the quasi-Yang-Baxter equation. We compute now the right hand side evaluated in h: [formula] (using the relation [formula]) [formula] (using the relation [formula], where ρ = R, [formula]) [formula] and this is obviously equal to the expression obtained for ((f  ·  g)  ·  l)(h).       The relations ε  ·  f = f  ·  ε = f and [formula] are obvious, using the fact that [formula] and [formula].

The Heisenberg double vs the Drinfel'd double for Hopf algebras

Let (H,R) be a quasitriangular bialgebra. We can consider it as a quasitriangular quasi-bialgebra with trivial associator, so the result in the previous section may be applied to H. Since the associator of H is trivial, H*R is an associative algebra and is an algebra also in the tensor categories Hl and Hr (that is, a left H-module algebra and a right Hcop-module algebra), but in general is not quantum commutative as algebra in Hl or Hr.       Let us note also the trivial fact that if (H,R) is a quasitriangular bialgebra then (Hcop,R21) is also a quasitriangular bialgebra and (Hcop)*R21 = (H*R)op.       Let now A be a finite dimensional Hopf algebra with antipode S. The Drinfel'd double of A, denoted by D(A), is a quasitriangular Hopf algebra realized on the k-linear space [formula]; its coalgebra structure is the one of [formula], the algebra structure is given by

[formula]

for all p,p'∈A* and a,a'∈A (see [\cite=rad1]), and the R-matrix is

[formula]

where {ei} is a basis of A and {ei} its dual basis in A*.       The Heisenberg double of A, denoted by H(A), is the smash product A  #  A*, where A* acts on A via the left regular action [formula] for all p∈A*,a∈A, so its multiplication is

[formula]

for all p,p'∈A* and a,a'∈A, where [formula] is the coalgebra structure of A*. The present name of A  #  A* is from [\cite=sts], while in [\cite=nill] and [\cite=maj1] it was used under the heading "Weyl algebra of A".       We have now the following application of the above construction H*R: Proof: the fact that the multiplication of H(A) may be obtained from the one of D(A)* is due to J.-H. Lu in [\cite=lu1], but with a slightly different approach, so we include here a proof for completeness. The multiplication in D(A)*R is given by:

[formula]

for all a,b∈A and f,g∈A*. Let x∈A, p∈A* and denote by 〈,〉 the evaluation map; we calculate: [formula] hence [formula], q.e.d.

Proof: if f,g∈H* then [formula] if and only if

[formula]

for all h∈H, and this holds for all f,g∈H* if and only if

[formula]

for all h∈H, which, by applying the relation Δcop(h)R = RΔ(h) several times is equivalent to

[formula]

for all h∈H, and this is of course equivalent to [formula]. The second statement follows immediately from the first.

If (H,R) is a quasitriangular Hopf algebra, we shall denote by Q the map Q:H*  →  H, [formula]. With this notation, let us recall the following       This is a natural condition, which was also proved in [\cite=h] to be useful in defining certain invariants for 3-manifolds.       It is natural to see how far is the map Q from being an algebra map, if we consider on H* the algebra structure H*R. Proof: let us compute (we denote R = r = ρ = T = α  =  β  =  γ  =  δ): [formula] (using: [formula] and [formula]) [formula] (using the Yang-Baxter equation: [formula]) [formula] (using the Yang-Baxter equation: [formula]) [formula], q.e.d.

It is natural to try to define an algebra structure on H* such that, with respect to this structure, Q becomes an algebra map. In view of the previous proposition and the fact that [formula], it is natural to define

[formula]

and indeed one can now check that this multiplication is associative (due to the associativity of ·  ) and that Q(fg) = Q(f)Q(g) (due to the previous proposition). This multiplication [formula] is just Majid's "covariantised product" (see [\cite=maj1], Th. 7.4.1), as one can easily check. The fact that Q(fg) = Q(f)Q(g) is also proved in [\cite=maj1], Prop. 7.4.3.       Let us say few more words about the relation between the two multiplications ·   and [formula] on H*. Define the following action of H on H*:

[formula]

Obviously H* is a left H-module via this action; using the description of [formula] in terms of ·   and the fact that (H*R,  ·  ) is an algebra in the category of H - Hcop-bimodules, one can see immediately that (H*,) is a left H-module algebra with respect to the action [formula]. It is not quantum commutative, but satisfies a condition called by Majid "braided commutativity" (see [\cite=maj1], Exp. 9.4.10). It is nice that this condition may be easily proved using the fact that (H*R,  ·  ) is quantum commutative as an H - Hcop-bimodule algebra.       Of course, if H is finite dimensional and factorizable, we can express the covariantised product as

[formula]

Now let A be a finite dimensional Hopf algebra. It is well-known that the Drinfel'd double of A is factorizable. An explicit proof (for the explicit realization of the double we work with) is written down in [\cite=rad2]. It uses the following       Another criterion for factorizability may be found in [\cite=gw].       Actually, one can give a direct proof of the factorizability of D(A): it is easy to see that in this case the map Q is given by

[formula]

for all a∈A,p∈A*, and it has an inverse given by

[formula]

[formula]

We can also write down explicit formulae for Radford's criterion applied to a Drinfel'd double: Proof: a direct computation, using the formula [formula].

Now we would like to write down the formula for the covariantised product corresponding to a Drinfel'd double D(A). It is slightly easier to do this using the explicit formulae obtained above for Q and Q- 1 rather than the definition in terms of ·  . We have then:

[formula]

for a,a'∈A and p,p'∈A*, and by a direct computation we obtain:

[formula]

and this is just the multiplication of the realization of the Drinfel'd double on [formula], see [\cite=maj1], p. 290. Moreover, if [formula] is the R-matrix of [formula], then one can see that [formula], which is the R-matrix of [formula]. Finally, the comultiplication of [formula] is

[formula]

and one can see that [formula] is a coalgebra map.       In conclusion, for a Drinfel'd double, the map Q in the definition of factorizability gives an isomorphism of quasitriangular Hopf algebras between the two realizations of the double, on [formula] and [formula]. For the general meaning of the map Q (i.e. for any quasitriangular Hopf algebra) in terms of "braided groups", we refer to [\cite=maj1], p. 490.       Now we shall speak about the pentagon equation, which, as the Yang-Baxter equation, appears in various contexts in mathematics and physics (see for instance [\cite=bs]). If A is a finite dimensional Hopf algebra, there exist two canonical procedures to construct (invertible) solutions for the pentagon equation: on the one hand, the map [formula] given by [formula] satisfies the pentagon equation w12w13w23 = w23w12, and its inverse is given by [formula] (see [\cite=maj1], p. 29). On the other hand, if we consider the element [formula] in [formula], where {ei} is a basis of A and {ei} its dual basis in A*, then W is also a solution to the pentagon equation (see [\cite=vdvk], [\cite=ka]). These two approaches are actually equivalent, because if we consider the algebra isomorphism λ:A  #  A*  →  End(A) given by [formula], for all a,b∈A and f∈A* (see [\cite=mon], p. 162) then we have [formula].       Since the Heisenberg double H(A) may be obtained from the Drinfel'd double D(A), it is natural to see whether we can obtain the element W from the R-matrix of D(A). Proof: recall that the map Q is given by [formula], so we shall compute: [formula], q.e.d.

Let us note that although this proposition expresses W in terms of the structure of D(A), it does not give an explanation, in terms of D(A), for why is W a solution to the pentagon equation. This would have been the case if we could have this proposition as a particular case of a more general statement, for instance, it was tempting to conjecture the following: "If (H,R) is a finite dimensional quasitriangular factorizable Hopf algebra, then the element [formula] is a solution to the pentagon equation with respect to the algebra structure of H*R". Unfortunately, at least in this generality, this is false. A counterexample may be obtained as follows. Suppose char(k) = 0 and k contains a primitive root of unity of order 3, ω say. Take G = {1,a,a2} a group of order 3, and take H = kG, with the following R-matrix (see [\cite=rad2]):

[formula]

It is known from [\cite=rad2] that (H,R) is factorizable, a fact which may be proved also directly: if {e0,e1,e2} is the basis of H* dual to {1,a,a2}, then one can check that the map Q:H*  →  H is given by:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

and that it is bijective, its inverse being the map Q- 1:H  →  H*,

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

The multiplication of H*R is given by:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

The element W is given by

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

and one can prove by a direct (but tedious) computation that W is not a solution to the pentagon equation.       However, one can ask for what classes of Hopf algebras the conjecture is true. A useful result may be the following: Proof: a) has been noticed before, so we prove b). By applying [formula], the relation we have to prove is equivalent to

[formula]

which is equivalent to

[formula]

where α  =  β  =  γ  =  δ = R, which, by applying [formula] (which is injective) and taking into account that [formula], is equivalent to

[formula]

which is obviously true.

A quantum groupoid with Heisenberg double as base

We recall first the following definitions from [\cite=lu2]:       Recall also from [\cite=lu2] the following results:       Now, we want to obtain an example of a Hopf algebroid having the Heisenberg double of a finite dimensional Hopf algebra A as base. We proceed as follows: first we give a generalization of the above theorem and then we use the quantum commutativity of the Heisenberg double of A as a D(A) - D(A)cop-bimodule algebra.       Let us recall first some notation and results from [\cite=rad1]. If (H,R) is a quasitriangular Hopf algebra, define the subspaces L = R(l) and D = R(r) by [formula] and [formula]. If we write [formula] where m is as small as possible, then {u1,...,um} is a basis for L and {v1,...,vm} is a basis for D, in particular dim L = dimD and this common dimension is called the rank of R and is denoted by rank(R). Moreover, L and D are (finite-dimensional) Hopf subalgebras of H and the map f:L* cop  →  D defined by [formula] for p∈L* is a Hopf algebra isomorphism.       Now we can generalize Lu's theorem as follows: Proof: since (with one exception) the proof follows closely the proof in [\cite=lu2], we shall just write down the structure maps and we shall give only those parts of the proof which, in [\cite=lu2], depend on the explicit structure of the Drinfel'd double. The map α:V  →  V  #  L is given by α(v) = v  #  1. Then, we know that the map f:L* cop  →  D, [formula] is an isomorphism of Hopf algebras, so V becomes a left L* cop-module algebra via f, in particular it becomes a right L-comodule; denote by [formula] the structure map. If we denote by [formula], for v∈V, we know that this is equivalent to [formula] for all p∈L*, where [formula]. So, β is given by the formula

[formula]

Then, exactly as in [\cite=lu2], using the properties of the R-matrix R and the quantum commutativity of V, one can prove that β is an algebra anti-homomorphism and that α(v)β(w) = β(w)α(v) for all v,w∈V. Let us note that, for v,w∈V and l∈L, we have in V  #  L: [formula] (we have used the quantum commutativity of V and the fact that [formula]) The V - V-bimodule structure of V  #  L is given by

[formula]

[formula]

The coproduct is given by

[formula]

[formula]

Obviously [formula] and Δ is a morphism of left V-modules. Let us prove that it is also a morphism of right V-modules. We calculate: [formula] [formula] (since the tensor product is over V) [formula], q.e.d. The coassociativity of Δ follows immediately from the one of ΔL. The compatibility of Δ with the product of V  #  L may be proved as in [\cite=lu2], once we prove the following identity which in [\cite=lu2] is proved using the structure of the Drinfel'd double:

[formula]

for all v∈V,l∈L. To prove this we compute: [formula] [formula] using the identity Δcop(l)R = RΔ(l). The section [formula] which is needed in this part of the proof (and also at the end) is given as in [\cite=lu2] by

[formula]

Since the proof of this part in [\cite=lu2] is rather tricky, let us give a proof using Xu's equivalent condition. We have to prove first that

[formula]

for all v,w∈V and l∈L. We calculate: [formula] (since the tensor product is over V) [formula] (we used the formula for the right module structure of V  #  L) [formula] and this is zero because Δcop(l)R = RΔ(l). Next we have to prove that

[formula]

in [formula] for all v,v'∈V and l,l'∈L, and this is trivial.       The counit is given by

[formula]

[formula]

and it is easy to see that it satisfies all the required properties. So, we have obtained so far a bialgebroid structure on V  #  L over V. We shall construct its antipode. Let [formula] be the canonical Drinfel'd element of H and define d0 = S(u)- 1 (this element is denoted by u2 in [\cite=dr1]). Then we know from [\cite=dr1] that d0 has the following properties: [formula] [formula] S2(h) = d0hd- 10 for all h∈H [formula] As in [\cite=lu2] one can prove that d0 acts as an algebra isomorphism on V. Define now the antipode of V  #  L, by

[formula]

[formula]

We shall prove that τβ  =  α. Let v∈V; we calculate: [formula] (where ρ = R and we used the relation [formula]) [formula] (using S2(x) = d0xd- 10) [formula] (since [formula], see [\cite=dr1]) [formula] (since [formula], see [\cite=dr1]) [formula] (again using S2(x) = d0xd- 10) [formula] (again since [formula]) = v  #  1 (since [formula]) =  α(v), q.e.d. The inverse of τ is given by

[formula]

[formula]

One can prove by a direct computation that τ- 1 is an algebra anti-homomorphism, then using this one can prove that τ- 1τ = id and finally that ττ- 1 = id by a computation similar to the proof of τβ  =  α. Hence τ is an algebra anti-isomorphism. The other axioms for τ are proved exactly as in [\cite=lu2].

Now, let A be a finite dimensional Hopf algebra. As we have seen before, H(A) is a quantum commutative left [formula]-module algebra, so the above theorem may be applied. Denote by [formula] the R-matrix of [formula], where R is the R-matrix of D(A) and U = R- 1. Since [formula] (see [\cite=dr1]) and the antipode of D(A) has the property that [formula] for all a∈A, it follows that R is given by [formula], where {ei} is a basis in A and {ei} its dual basis in A*. Then it is easy to see that the set [formula] is a k-linear basis in R(l), so R(l) may be identified as linear spaces with [formula], and from the Hopf algebra structure of [formula] we can see that actually R(l) may be identified with [formula] as Hopf subalgebras of [formula]. Some calculations with the explicit formulae given before for the left and right regular actions of D(A) on H(A) show that the left [formula]-module structure of H(A) is given by:

[formula]

for all a,b∈A and p,q∈A*. In conclusion, we obtain:

Something like a vertex group

We start with the following definition, which is a variation of the one in [\cite=b1]. Proof: define α:A*  →  H(A) = A  #  A*, α(p) = 1  #  p, which is of course an algebra map. We have seen that H(A) is a D(A) - D(A)cop-bimodule algebra; by restricting the actions of D(A) on H(A) to actions of A and since A is cocommutative, we obtain that H(A) is an A-bimodule algebra. Take {ei} a basis in A and {ei} its dual basis in A* and define τ:A  #  A*  →  A  #  A* by

[formula]

This is just the map τ- 1 in the previous section written for H(A) instead of H(A*) (we have used also the fact that S2 = id); we already know that this is an algebra anti-isomorphism.       Let us check the other axioms of a vertex group. In order to simplify the calculations we shall use the version of Sweedler's sigma notation introduced in [\cite=mas] for dealing with cocommutative Hopf algebras, namely for a∈A we shall denote [formula], [formula] etc. With this notation, the antipode axiom for A is written as [formula] for all a∈A.       Let us prove that α is a bimodule map, namely

[formula]

for all a,b∈A and p∈A*, that is

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] are considered as elements in the Drinfel'd double of A. By evaluating in an element [formula], the lhs becomes φ(1)p(bxa) and the rhs may be calculated as: [formula], q.e.d. It is very easy to see that τ(1  #  p) = 1  #  S(p), so let us check the last two axioms for τ. From the general formulae for the actions of D(A) on H(A) given in a previous section we can write down the actions of A on H(A):

[formula]

[formula]

for all a,b∈A and p∈A*. We calculate: [formula] which evaluated in an element [formula] gives [formula] On the other hand, we have: [formula] which evaluated in [formula] gives: [formula] so we have obtained [formula].       Now we prove the last relation. [formula] which evaluated in [formula] gives [formula] [formula] which evaluated in [formula] gives: [formula] so that [formula], q.e.d.

The Heisenberg double for quasi-Hopf algebras

In this section we return to quasi-Hopf algebras and suggest a possible definition for Heisenberg doubles of them.       If A is a finite dimensional quasi-Hopf algebra, it was proved in [\cite=maj2] that there exists a unique (up to isomorphism) quasitriangular quasi-Hopf algebra (D(A),R) with the property that the category D(A)-mod is braided equivalent to the centre of the tensor category A-mod. This D(A) is called the quantum double of A (it generalizes the Drinfel'd double for Hopf algebras). Some concrete realizations of D(A) (on [formula] and [formula]) have been given in [\cite=hn1], [\cite=hn2].       Now we can propose the following       From a previous discussion and the uniqueness of D(A), it follows that H(A) is "unique up to isomorphism".       Because of the complicated structure of D(A), it is quite difficult to write down explicitly the formula for the multiplication in H(A), and we shall not do this here. Instead, we shall do this in a particular case, related to the Dijkgraaf-Pasquier-Roche quasi-Hopf algebras Dω(G) introduced in [\cite=dpr]. We shall work in the slightly more general situation of [\cite=bp] and we begin by recalling the relevant parts of the construction in [\cite=bp].       Let H be a finite dimensional cocommutative Hopf algebra (for which we shall use the variation of Σ-notation as in the previous section) with antipode S, and [formula] a normalized 3-cocycle in the Sweedler cohomology [\cite=sw1], that is ω is k-linear, convolution invertible and satisfies the conditions:

[formula]

[formula]

for all x,y,z,t∈H. Introduce also the following notation: [formula] for all g,x∈H. Then, on the k-linear space [formula] may be constructed a quasitriangular quasi-Hopf algebra, denoted by Dω(H), for which the multiplication is given by

[formula]

for all p,p'∈H* and h,h'∈H, where [formula] is given by

[formula]

for all x,y,g∈H, where [formula],

[formula]

for g,x,y∈H, where ω- 1 is the convolution inverse of ω.       Define the map [formula] by

[formula]

for x,g,h∈H, and the map [formula], by [formula]. Identifying [formula] with [formula], we shall write, for any h∈H, [formula], and this relation is equivalent to [formula] for all x,y∈H. Then the comultiplication of Dω(H) is given by

[formula]

[formula]

The associator of Dω(H) is ω- 1 (regarded in [formula]) and the R-matrix is

[formula]

where {ei} is a basis in H and {ei} its dual basis in H*. Recall also from [\cite=bp] the following identity:

[formula]

It was proved in [\cite=pvo] that Dω(H) is (isomorphic to) the quantum double of a certain quasi-Hopf algebra denoted by H*ω, which is just H* with its usual Hopf algebra structure but with a nontrivial associator, namely ω- 1.       We can recover the DPR quasi-Hopf algebra Dω(G) in [\cite=dpr] by taking H to be the group algebra of a finite group G.       Let us note that if ω is trivial, then Dω(H) is a Hopf algebra, isomorphic to the Drinfel'd double of H*; but since we worked with the realization of Dω(H) on [formula] rather than [formula], we can see from the explicit formulae given above that (Dtriv(H),R) = (D(H)cop,R21), where D(H) is the usual Drinfel'd double of H and R in the rhs is the R-matrix of D(H).       We can compute now the multiplication in Dω(H)*R (which is, by our definition, the Heisenberg double of H*ω). Take [formula] and evaluate their product against an element [formula]: [formula] So, we have obtained the following formula:

[formula]

Let us note that if ω is trivial this formula becomes

[formula]

which is the multiplication of H(H)op (this is not a surprize, since (Dtriv(H),R) = (D(H)cop,R21)), which in turn is naturally isomorphic to H(H*) (see [\cite=lu1]), so that Dω(H)*R is indeed a generalization of the usual Heisenberg double of H*.
