Determinant line bundle on moduli space of parabolic bundles

Introduction

Let X be a compact connected Riemann surface of genus g and S    ⊂    X a finite nonempty subset; if g    =    0, then #  S    ≥    3. Fix a positive integer r. For each point s  ∈  S, fix sequences

[formula]

and [formula]. Let MP be the moduli space of sable parabolic vector bundles of rank r and degree d over X associated to this data.

In [\cite=BR1], [\cite=BR2], generalizing the determinant line bundle over the moduli space of usual vector bundles, a parabolic determinant line bundle was constructed which is a holomorphic Hermitian line bundle over MP. Fix a ramified Galois covering

[formula]

such that MP is identified with a moduli space MY(Γ) of stable Γ-linearized vector bundles, where [formula], over Y.

It was shown that the parabolic determinant line bundle is holomorphically identified with the usual determinant line bundle over MY(Γ). The Hermitian structure on the parabolic determinant line bundle was obtained by pulling back the Quillen metric on the usual determinant line bundle over MY(Γ). Our aim here is to give a direct construction of the Hermitian structure on the parabolic determinant line bundle.

Fix a conical metric h on X. We show that any stable parabolic vector bundle E*  ∈  MP admits a unique Hermitian-Einstein connection with respect to h (see Theorem [\ref=thm1]). This Hermitian-Einstein structure plays a crucial role in the construction of the Hermitian structure on the parabolic determinant line bundle.

Faltings' semistability criterion says that a vector bundle E on a smooth complex projective curve C is semistable if and only if there is a vector bundle F    →    C such that [formula] for i    =    0,1 [\cite=Fa]. This criterion has the following generalization for parabolic vector bundles.

Fix X and parabolic divisor S as above. Fix a positive integer N; all the parabolic weights will be assumed to be integral multiples of 1 / N. There is a parabolic vector bundle V0* with the following property: a parabolic vector bundle E* is parabolic semistable if and only if there is another parabolic vector bundle F* such that

[formula]

for i    =    0,1, where [formula] is the vector bundle underlying the parabolic tensor product [formula]. (See [\cite=Bi2].)

The above parabolic vector bundle V0* is the other key input in the construction of the Hermitian structure on the parabolic determinant line bundle.

Preliminaries

Let X be a compact connected Riemann surface. Fix a finite subset

[formula]

A parabolic vector bundle over X with S as the parabolic divisor is a vector bundle E on X equipped with a parabolic structure over S, meaning for each point s  ∈  S, we have

a filtration

[formula]

of subspaces of the fiber Es, and

rational numbers

[formula]

The sequence in [\eqref=e2] is called the quasiparabolic filtration, and the sequence in [\eqref=e3] is called the parabolic weights. The points of S are called parabolic points. For notational convenience, a vector bundle E with a parabolic structure will be denoted by E*.

The parabolic degree of E* is defined to be

[formula]

Any subbundle F of E has an induced parabolic structure. We recall that a parabolic vector bundle E* is called semistable if for all proper subbundles F    ⊂    E of positive rank, the inequality

[formula]

holds, where F* is the parabolic vector bundle defined by the induced parabolic structure on F. If the strict inequality

[formula]

holds then E* is called stable.

A semistable parabolic vector bundle is called polystable if it is a direct sum of stable parabolic vector bundles.

Fix a positive integer r, and also fix an integer d. Let MP denote the moduli space of stable parabolic vector bundles of rank r and degree d with a fixed type of quasiparabolic filtration and fixed parabolic weights. (See [\cite=MS] for the construction of MP as well as some of its properties.)

We will assume that S and the parabolic data are such that dim MP    >    0. Note that this assumption rules out the case where [formula] and #  S    =    1. Indeed, if [formula] with #  S    =    {s}, then using the Grothendieck's theorem that any vector bundle over [formula] splits into a direct sum of line bundles it follows that any semistable parabolic vector bundle E* must be of the following form:

[formula]

where [formula] is a line bundle, and the quasiparabolic filtration is the trivial filtration

[formula]

A theorem due to Faltings says that a vector bundle E over X is semistable if and only if there is another vector bundle E' such that [formula] is cohomologically trivial, meaning

[formula]

[\cite=Fa]. This criterion can be generalized to the context of parabolic vector bundles in the following way. Fix a positive integer N. Consider parabolic vector bundles with parabolic weights integral multiples of 1 / N (with arbitrary quasiparabolic structure and rank).

Then there is a parabolic vector bundle V0* with the following property: A parabolic vector bundle E* is semistable if and only if there is a parabolic vector bundle E'* such that the vector bundle [formula] underlying the parabolic tensor product [formula] is cohomologically trivial.

It should be emphasized that such a parabolic vector bundle V0* can be explicitly constructed. We recall a construction of a parabolic vector bundle V0* that satisfies the above condition.

Fix a Galois covering

[formula]

such that

f is ramified exactly over S, and

the ramification index of each point in f- 1(S) is N - 1, where N is the fixed integer such that all the parabolic weights are integral multiples of 1 / N.

See [\cite=Na] for the existence of f satisfying these conditions. Let

[formula]

be the Galois group for the covering f. There is a natural bijective correspondence between the following two classes:

all Γ-linearized vector bundles on Y, and

the parabolic vector bundles over X for which the parabolic divisor in contained in S and all the parabolic weights are integral multiples of 1 / N.

(See [\cite=Bi1].)

Consider the trivial vector bundle over Y

[formula]

where [formula] is the group algebra of Γ defined in [\eqref=gl]. The action of Γ on Y produces an action of Γ on OY. The natural action of Γ on [formula] and the action of Γ on OY together define a Γ-linearization on the vector bundle [formula] in ([\ref=hW]). Let

[formula]

be the parabolic vector bundle over X corresponding to the Γ-linearized vector bundle [formula]. This parabolic vector bundle V0* satisfies the condition in Lemma [\ref=lem1]. (See [\cite=Bi2], [\cite=BH].)

Conical metric on X

Fix a positive integer N.

Let S be the subset in [\eqref=e1]. Set

[formula]

Let [formula] be the unit disk. For a point x  ∈  X, a holomorphic coordinate around x is a holomorphic embedding

[formula]

such that φ(x)    =    0.

A conical metric on X of order N is a Hermitian metric h on the holomorphic tangent bundle TX' satisfying the following condition: For each point x  ∈  D, there is a holomorphic coordinate around x

[formula]

such that

[formula]

where [formula] is a smooth function; [formula] is identified with [formula] using φ.

Let E* be a parabolic vector bundle over X. Let E be the vector bundle underlying the parabolic bundle E*.

A Hermitian structure on E* is a Hermitian structure H on E|X' satisfying the following condition: Take any point s  ∈  S, and take any holomorphic section σ of E defined around s. If σ(s) is a nonzero element of Es,i    ⊂    Es (see [\eqref=e2]), then

[formula]

(see [\eqref=e3] for αi(s)), where z is a holomorphic coordinate around s, and f is a smooth function with values in positive real numbers.

Fix a conical metric of order N on X. Let ω be the corresponding Kähler form on X'.

Let E* be a parabolic vector bundle over X with the property that all the parabolic weights of E* are integral multiples of 1 / N.

A Hermitian structure H on E* is called Hermitian-Einstein if the curvature of the Chern connection on E|X' for H is of the form

[formula]

where λ is some constant positive real number.

Let E* be a stable parabolic vector bundle over X such that all the parabolic weights of E* are integral multiples of 1 / N. Then E* admits a Hermitian-Einstein structure. If H and H1 are two Hermitian-Einstein structures on E*, then

[formula]

where c is a constant real positive number.

Let f  :  Y    →    X be the covering in [\eqref=f]. The pullback of the (fixed) conical metric on X defines a Hermitian structure on [formula]. From the definition of the conical metric it follows that this Hermitian metric on [formula] extends to a Hermitian metric on Y. Let [formula] be the Kähler form on Y associated to this Hermitian structure on Y.

Let

[formula]

be the Γ-linearized vector bundle corresponding to the parabolic vector bundle E*. Since E* is parabolic stable, it follows that the corresponding Γ-linearized vector bundle W is polystable [\cite=BBN]. Consequently, W admits a Hermitian-Einstein structure [\cite=Do]. The Hermitian-Einstein structure is not unique, but the Hermitian-Einstein connection is unique. From the uniqueness of the Hermitian-Einstein connection it follows immediately that the action of Γ on W preserves the Hermitian-Einstein connection. Consequently, for any Hermitian-Einstein structure HW on W, the Hermitian form

[formula]

is Hermitian-Einstein. Clearly, the action of Γ on W preserves the Hermitian form H'W. Therefore, H'W descends to a Hermitian structure on [formula]. It is now straight-forward to check that this Hermitian structure on [formula] is a Hermitian structure on the parabolic vector bundle E*.

From the definition of a Hermitian-Einstein structure on E* it follows that any two Hermitian-Einstein forms on E* differ by an automorphism of the parabolic vector bundle E*. Since E* is parabolic stable, all parabolic automorphisms are constant scalar multiplications. Hence any two Hermitian-Einstein forms on E* differ by multiplication with a constant real number. This completes the proof of the theorem.

The determinant line bundle

Let E    →    X  ×  T be a holomorphic vector bundle, where T is a complex manifold. We will consider E as a holomorphic family of vector bundles over X parametrized by T. Let

[formula]

be the projection. The direct images R0p*E and R1p*E are coherent analytic sheaves on T. Therefore,

[formula]

i    =    0  ,1, are holomorphic line bundles over T (see [\cite=Ko] for the construction of the determinant line bundle of a coherent analytic sheaf). If T is algebraic, and E is an algebraic vector bundle, then the line bundle det (Rip*E) is also algebraic.

The determinant of the family E is defined to be the line bundle

[formula]

Let

[formula]

be a family of parabolic vector bundles of fixed quasiparabolic type and fixed parabolic weights. Let

[formula]

be the natural projection. Consider the parabolic vector bundle V0* constructed in [\eqref=V]. So p*XV0* is a constant family of parabolic vector bundles parametrized by T. Let

[formula]

be the family of parabolic vector bundles obtained by taking the parabolic tensor product. Let

[formula]

be the family of vector bundles underlying the family of parabolic vector bundles in [\eqref=e4].

The parabolic determinant bundle for the family E* is defined to be the line bundle

[formula]

(see [\eqref=d]). The parabolic determinant bundle for E* will be denoted by pd(E*).

Let MP be a moduli space of stable parabolic vector bundles over X of rank r and degree d with a fixed type of quasiparabolic filtration and fixed parabolic weights. In general, there is no universal parabolic vector bundle over X  ×  MP. However, every point z  ∈  MP has an open neighborhood Uz in étale topology such that there is a universal parabolic vector bundle over X  ×  Uz. Hence there is an open neighborhood U'z of z in analytic topology such that there is a universal parabolic vector bundle over X  ×  U'z.

Using the locally defined universal parabolic vector bundles on MP, we can construct locally defined parabolic determinant bundles.

Fix a point x0  ∈  X. Let E* be a locally defined (in either étale or analytic topology) universal parabolic vector bundles over X  ×  U. The vector bundle over U obtained by restricting the underlying vector bundler E to {x0}  ×  U will be denoted by Ex0.

Assume that T is connected. Hence the function [formula] that sends any E*  ∈  MP to

[formula]

is a constant one.

The locally defined line bundles

[formula]

(see Definition [\ref=def1]) patch together naturally to define an algebraic line bundle over MP.

Let E* be a stable parabolic vector bundle. Take any automorphism τ of the underlying vector bundle E that preserves the quasiparabolic filtrations. Since E* is stable, we know that [formula] for some [formula]. Using this it follows that if E* and E'* are two universal parabolic vector bundles over X  ×  U, then there is a natural line bundle L    →    U and a canonical isomorphism

[formula]

where φ  :  X  ×  U    →    U is the projection. In fact, we may take

[formula]

(here Hom is the sheaf of parabolic homomorphisms). In this case, the isomorphism in [\eqref=e6] is given by the natural pairing

[formula]

From [\eqref=e6] and the projection formula it follows that

[formula]

where χ is defined in [\eqref=chi]. On the other hand, from [\eqref=e6],

[formula]

From [\eqref=e7] and [\eqref=e8],

[formula]

This completes the proof of the lemma.

Let

[formula]

be the holomorphic line bundle obtained from Lemma [\ref=lem2].

There is a parabolic determinant line bundle on MP; see [\cite=BR1] and [\cite=BR2] for its construction.

The holomorphic line bundle D in Definition [\ref=D] coincides with the parabolic determinant line bundle.

Take any parabolic vector bundle E*  ∈  MP. Let

[formula]

be the Γ-linearized vector bundle corresponding to E*, where Y is the Galois covering in [\eqref=f]. For i    =    0  ,1, we have

[formula]

[\cite=BH] (in [\cite=BH] it is proved for i    =    0, but the proof is identical for i    =    1; see [\cite=Bi2]). Using [\eqref=i] it is straight-forward to check that D coincides with the parabolic determinant line bundle.

Hermitian structures

Hermitian structure on V0

Let V0 denote the vector bundle underlying the parabolic bundle V0* in [\eqref=V]. We will first construct a Hermitian structure on the restriction of V0 to

[formula]

Consider the group Γ in [\eqref=gl]. Let hΓ be the inner product on the group algebra [formula] defined by

[formula]

This inner product hΓ defines a Hermitian structure on the trivial vector bundle [formula] in [\eqref=hW]. The action of the Galois group [formula] on [formula] preserves this Hermitian structure. The pullback f*(V0|X') is identified with the restriction of [formula] to f- 1(X')    ⊂    Y, where X' is the open subset in [\eqref=xp]. Consequently, there is a unique Hermitian structure on V0|X' such that the identification of f*(V0|X') with [formula] is an isometry.

Let h0 denote the Hermitian structure on V0|X' constructed above.

It is straight-forward to check that h0 is a Hermitian structure on the parabolic vector bundle V0*.

The parabolic vector bundle V0* is polystable. Hence it has a Hermitian-Einstein structure (see Theorem [\ref=thm1]). The following proposition is obtained by comparing the constructions of the Hermitian structure h0 (see Definition [\ref=h-v]) and Hermitian-Einstein structure in Theorem [\ref=thm1].

The Hermitian structure h0 on the polystable parabolic vector bundle V0* is a Hermitian-Einstein form.

Hermitian structure on D

Fix a positive integer N such that all the parabolic weights in the parabolic data associated to MP are integral multiples of 1 / N. Fix a conical metric h of order N on X.

Let E*  ∈  MP be a stable parabolic vector bundle. Let H be a Hermitian-Einstein form on E*. From Theorem [\ref=thm1] we know that H is determined uniquely up to a constant scalar.

The Hermitian form h0 on V0|X' (see [\eqref=h-v]) and the Hermitian-Einstein form H on E* together define a Hermitian-Einstein structure on [formula], where X' is defined in [\eqref=xp]. This Hermitian structure on [formula] defines a Hermitian structure on the parabolic tensor product [formula]. Let Ĥ denote the Hermitian structure on the parabolic vector bundle [formula] given by the above Hermitian structure on [formula].

Let [formula] be the vector bundle underlying the parabolic vector bundle [formula].

The Hermitian structure Ĥ and the conical metric h together define a Hermitian structure on the vector space [formula].

The Hermitian structure Ĥ induces a Hermitian structure on

[formula]

The restriction of it to the orthogonal complement of the image of the Dolbeault operator for the holomorphic vector bundle [formula]

[formula]

defines a Hermitian structure on the vector space [formula].

Let

[formula]

be the Laplacian of the operator in [\eqref=dol].

Consider the complex line

[formula]

(compare it with Definition [\ref=def1]). The above inner products on [formula] and [formula] together produce an inner product on pd(E*). Using the Quillen's construction, we modify this inner product on pd(E*) using the eigenvalues of the Laplacian [formula] defined in [\eqref=l] (see [\cite=Qu]). This procedure produces a Hermitian structure on the holomorphic line bundle pd(E*)    →    T (see Definition [\ref=def1]). Hence we get a Hermitian structure on the holomorphic line bundle

[formula]

constructed in Definition [\ref=D].

The above Hermitian structure on the holomorphic line bundle D    →    MP will be denoted by HpQ.

Consider the covering f in [\eqref=f]. As noted in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm1], the pullback of the conical metric h by f produces a Hermitian metric on Y. As before, the Kähler form on Y associated to this Hermitian metric will be denoted by [formula].

Let

[formula]

be the Γ-linearized vector bundle corresponding to E*, where Y is the Galois covering in [\eqref=f]. Let

[formula]

be the Dolbeault operator for the holomorphic vector bundle W. Since the vector bundle W is polystable, it has a Hermitian-Einstein structure. Using this Hermitian-Einstein structure and the Kähler form [formula] on Y we define the Laplacian

[formula]

It can be shown that the eigenvalues of ΔW, along with their multiplicities, coincide with those of the operator [formula] constructed in [\eqref=l]. Indeed,

[formula]

are identified with [formula] and [formula] respectively, and these identifications preserve the inner products. Furthermore, these identifications take the differential operator [formula] to [formula]. Consequently, these identification takes [formula] to ΔW. Hence the eigenvalues of ΔW, along with their multiplicities, coincide with those of the operator [formula].

Therefore, we have the following proposition:

The holomorphic isomorphism in Lemma [\ref=lem-d] between D and the parabolic determinant line bundle takes in Hermitian structure HpQ in Definition [\ref=def2] to the Hermitian structure on the parabolic determinant line bundle.

See [\cite=BR1], [\cite=BR2] for the construction of the Hermitian structure on the parabolic determinant line bundle.
