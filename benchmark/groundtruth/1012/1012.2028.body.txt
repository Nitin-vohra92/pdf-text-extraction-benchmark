Gravitational radiation from radial infall of a particle into a Schwarzschild black hole. A numerical study of the spectra, quasi-normal modes and power-law tails.

Introduction

The gravitational radiation due to a point-like particle falling into a black hole (BH) is a classic problem in General Relativity whose first computation goes back to the 1970s [\cite=DRPP] [\cite=DRT]. Being an elementary BH perturbation, it served as one of the first numerical applications of the BH perturbation theory initially developed in the classic papers [\cite=RW] [\cite=Z]. The present literature in this field is abundant and the infalling particle model sometimes appears as a limit case of more general scenarios such as the infall of an arbitrary number of particles [\cite=BC1] or, most importantly, the coalescence of BH binaries [\cite=BC3], where it corresponds to the extreme mass-ratio limit.

The general features of the radiated waveform are by now well understood [\cite=A]. The first part of the signal the observer receives is called the precursor and corresponds to the radiation emitted directly from the infalling source to the observer. It is therefore insensitive to what happens near the BH and it was shown that it can be well described by a resummation of the Post-Newtonian expansion [\cite=DN1] [\cite=DN2] [\cite=DN3] [\cite=BC4]. Then comes the ring-down phase which is dominated by a superposition of the quasi-normal modes (QNMs) of the BH. These are characteristic information of the metric and are therefore brought by waves that were reflected in the neighborhood of the maximum of the effective potential of the problem (the "barrier"), situated at ~  1.5 radii. The QNMs are a very interesting feature also because they provide a possible bridge between classical and quantum gravity [\cite=Bek] [\cite=H] [\cite=Ber] [\cite=MQNM]. Finally, the wave exhibits a power-law tail at large values of the retarded time, after the ring-down has been exponentially cut-off. This residual radiation corresponds to waves that were not initially heading towards the observer but ended up reaching him by scattering off the background metric at large distance of the horizon, hence the delay and the decrease in amplitude.

In this paper, we focus on the simplest case, the radial infall starting at infinity with no initial velocity, as in the original works [\cite=DRPP] [\cite=DRT] (computations for more general initial data include for example [\cite=LP] [\cite=MP] [\cite=BC3]). The spectrum of the radiated signal can be computed from a numerical integration of a single wave-equation, the Zerilli equation [\cite=Z]. The first part of our work consists in performing this computation for multipoles up to l = 6 with high accuracy, that is ~  10- 5. This allows us to analyze the spectra at quantitatively higher orders than present estimates. The waveforms, which are obtained by Fourier transforming the spectra, reach an accuracy of ~  10- 4 and ~  10- 2 at worst. For l  ≤  4, we are able to keep that precision on a relatively large interval of retarded time which includes the beginning of the power-law phase. Finally, we extract the QNM frequencies by fitting the ring-down phase with damped sinuses and then compare the results with the values obtained through direct computations [\cite=L] [\cite=K] [\cite=ECS]. This way we determine how "visible" the QNMs are.

The organization of the paper is as follows. In section [\ref=sec:th] we recall the main formulas describing the production of gravitational radiation from a radially in-falling test mass. In section [\ref=sec:re] we present and discuss our results. Finally, an account of computational details and error estimation is presented in the appendix.

Theoretical background

In what follows, m and M are the masses of the particle and BH, respectively. We use units G  =  c  =  1 and the following definition of the Fourier transform

[formula]

The clear distinction in mass scales between the BH and the particle allows the problem to be treated within BH perturbation theory to first order (linearized Einstein equations). Therefore, the particle is a test mass, i.e. moving along the geodesics of the unperturbed space-time, and produces a perturbation hμν (of the metric) which is a test tensor field (on the geometry) since we only keep first order terms of it in the Einstein equations. These can be reduced to two independent one-dimensional scalar wave-equations for each l multipole (in the tensor spherical harmonics decomposition), where l represents the total angular momentum number. The wave-equation's effective potential term has no m dependence since the background metric is spherically symmetric. In the case of the radial in-fall of a particle, nor does the source term because of cylindrical symmetry. Thus the m  ≠  0 modes are not excited. At each l, these equations describe the dynamics of the two eigenstates of the parity operator, which don't mix because of the symmetry of the background metric under parity, and together fully determine the 2l-pole of hμν. In the case of the radial infall of a particle, only the so called polar modes are excited and we are left with one equation, the Zerilli equation. Denoting its solution by ψl, the radial dependence of the 2l-pole of hμν is ~  (1 / r)ψl(t - r) in the radiation zone. The Zerilli equation on the frequency domain is [\cite=Z]

[formula]

where as usual r*  =  r  +  2M ln (r / 2M  -  1), and the effective potential is

[formula]

with λ  =  (l - 1)(l + 2) / 2. The source term is

[formula]

where T(r) is determined by the geodesic of the particle in the metric,

[formula]

The differential equation ([\ref=eq:IDE]) is solved with boundary conditions of purely ingoing waves at the radius and purely outgoing ones at infinity

[formula]

These correspond to the fact that the source is always localized in space and therefore GWs can only be emitted towards the infinities. In order to compute the radiated amplitude of the ω-mode Al,out(ω), it is convenient to use the Green's function method. Let y-l(r*,ω) and y+l(r*,ω) be the solutions of the homogeneous equation of ([\ref=eq:IDE])

[formula]

with boundary conditions

[formula]

so that they match ([\ref=eq:PsiICin]) and ([\ref=eq:PsiICout]) in the final solution. At r*  →    ∞   the potential vanishes and y-l tends towards the analytical form.

[formula]

Thus the reflection and transmission coefficients of Vl for a monochromatic wave coming from plus infinity are

[formula]

which we also compute for reasons made clear in section [\ref=sec:ab]. The Wronskian may be written Wl(ω)  =  2iωβl(ω) and, in the radiation zone, one obtains

[formula]

which by definition of the outgoing ω-mode ([\ref=eq:PsiICout]) gives

[formula]

Given the choice of normalization in ([\ref=eq:Fou]), the radiated energy spectrum of the l-mode is [\cite=Z] [\cite=DRPP]

[formula]

The waveform is found using the inverse Fourier transform. Introducing the retarded time [formula], we have

[formula]

The last equality comes from ([\ref=eq:PsiICout]) and the fact that ψl is real, i.e. Al,out( - ω)  =  Āl,out(ω). So the procedure consists in computing y-l through eq. ([\ref=eq:HDE]) with initial condition given by eq. ([\ref=eq:YIC]), and then evaluating ([\ref=eq:A]) by extracting βl(ω) out of eq. ([\ref=eq:YLL]) and performing the integral. Once we have Al,out(ω), the energy spectrum is given by ([\ref=eq:dEdw]) and the wave-function is computed through eq. ([\ref=eq:wout]).

Results

In this section we present the results of our numerical integration. A detailed account of the numerical procedure and error estimation is given in appendices [\ref=ch:comp] and [\ref=ch:err], respectively. From now on we simplify the notation by dropping the "out" subscript in Al,out(ω) and ψl,out(ω) and writing [formula]. The figures are collected at the end of the paper.

Analysis of the frequency spectrum

The top and middle panels of figure [\ref=fig:All_l] give the energy spectrum fl(ω) in both linear and logarithmic scales, the modulus |Al(ω)| and phase φl(ω) (of Al(ω)). The shape of the energy spectra is in agreement with the result of ref. [\cite=DRPP]. In table [\ref=tab:Espec] we list the radiated energies for every 2l-pole, that is

[formula]

To better characterize the energy spectrum, we have also computed the values [formula] at which fl(ω) is maximal and the following quantities:

[formula]

We also use [formula] as an estimation of the total spectrum.

The estimation Et of the total radiated energy (bottom left of table [\ref=tab:Espec]) is to be compared with the value ≃0.0104m2 / M given in [\cite=DRPP]. To a first approximation, El seems to follow the exponential trend proposed in [\cite=DRPP], which is ~  e- 2l. We find that the form

[formula]

actually provides a better fit. Assuming that energies for l  >  6 follow this empirical law, we get the order of the contribution of the neglected multipoles in the total energy, that is El > 6  ~  10- 7m2 / M, which is less than our numerical precision for Et. As for the maximum of ft(ω), we find it is situated at [formula] whereas [\cite=DRPP] finds ≃0.32.

We now study the asymptotic behavior of the spectra.

Low frequency limit

In this limit we find that our numerical results are very well fitted by

[formula]

and

[formula]

that is, φl and fl have a power-law behavior. Within our numerical precision, we find that, for the multipoles [formula] that we have studied, φl(ω = 0) is very well reproduced by

[formula]

In order to obtain the coefficients aφl,bφl,afl,bfl with great accuracy it is necessary to perform the fit in the very low frequency region. In Table [\ref=tab:LF] we show these coefficients, obtained by performing a fit at 2Mω  ~  10- 4, and we find that

[formula]

reproduces our results very well.

For l = 2 we are even able to go down to 2Mω  ~  10- 6 and we get

[formula]

For each given l, the low frequency asymptotic behavior for fl(ω) and φl(ω = 0) can be computed analytically because it is due to the motion of the particle far from the horizon, where the trajectory can be well approximated by the Newtonian one and the GW emission can be computed using the multipole expansion in flat space. For l = 2 the contribution comes from the mass quadrupole and the computation is performed in ref. [\cite=Wag] (see also section 4.3.1 of ref. [\cite=MGW]). The result is

[formula]

so our numerical result ([\ref=eq:fl2ex]) reproduces very well the exact analytic behavior. This is a significant check of our numerical procedure. We have also performed this analytical computation for l = 3 and again got agreement with eqs. ([\ref=eq:ph0]) and ([\ref=eq:ftrend]). Both equations can be combined into

[formula]

where al is a positive real number. Finally, the φl(ω) variation, which is not computable analytically, is found to be constant with respect to l within our error margins

[formula]

High frequency limit

For this limit the full relativistic treatment is necessary and there is no simple analytical expression to compare with. Here we only focus on fl. The top right panel of figure [\ref=fig:All_l] clearly suggests an exponential cutoff. We find that the fitting form

[formula]

gives the best fit. Table [\ref=tab:HF] lists the resulting values for the parameters.

Waveforms and quasi-normal modes

In figures [\ref=fig:l2] to [\ref=fig:l6] we show, for [formula], the amplitude spectrum Al(ω), the waveform ψl(u), the fit of its ringdown phase using QNMs and its power-law tail (compared to the obtained QNM fit).

In the waveform plots, we observe that the number of significant oscillations in the ring-down increases with l while its typical length appears to be the same for all l. The precursor's typical length decreases with l. The typical amplitude decreases quite fast, as suggested by the empirical law in the corresponding energy ([\ref=eq:Etrend]).

As for the recovery of the QNM frequencies by fitting the ring-down phase, the procedure has already worked very well in numerical studies on the coalescence of BH binaries [\cite=BCP] [\cite=BC4]. It is therefore expected to work well in the case of the infalling particle model since it is a special case of the latter and numerically much simpler to treat. Table [\ref=tab:QNMfit] lists the results of the fit for the first three overtones while table [\ref=tab:QNMex] lists the values obtained through direct numerical computations [\cite=L] [\cite=K] [\cite=ECS] (see appendix [\ref=ch:comp], eq. ([\ref=eq:QNMt]) for the fitting form). On the top panel of figure [\ref=fig:QNM] we see that our error margins cover the expected values only for the first overtone (n  =  1). Looking at the plots with the fitting curves, we see that the first mode's domination interval is pretty much the same for all l. On the other hand, the power-law contribution sets in later or is relatively weaker with increasing l. The high-l graphics are indeed the ones were the QNMs fitted the wave best, so the QNM contribution becomes more "visible" with increasing l. Inversely, in the case of l  =  2, the power-law tail contribution sets in so early that it prevents us from even having a visible superposition of fit and data.

Finally, concerning the tail of the wave, analytical studies [\cite=A] show that it is actually a superposition of power-laws and that one has to go quite far in retarded time in order to see the leading term dominate. However, at such high values our precision breaks down so we cannot perform any useful fit but we still display the graphic result for l  =  2,3,4 at lower u. The error on the l  =  5,6 cases is already notable at relatively low u.

Computational details

In this section we present all the algorithms and techniques involved in the calculations. From now on we use only dimensionless variables. Thus, in what follows, ω, r*, Al,out, fl, El and ψl,out actually stand for 2Mω, r* / 2M, Al,out / (Mm), fl / m2, M / m2El and ψl,out / m, respectively. Relative errors and margins are denoted using the symbol δ whereas Δ is used to denote absolute errors or integration grid steps, depending on the context.

The βl(ω) parameter

Consider equation ([\ref=eq:YLL]). The convergence towards that asymptotic form being too slow, we use the next order terms (as in [\cite=LP]):

[formula]

We take 47 equally spaced sample points over 5 typical periods 2π  /  ω on y-l and plug them in ([\ref=eq:MYLL]). Having four complex unknowns, this gives us an overdetermined linear system Ax  =  b, where A is a 47  ×  4 complex matrix and x  =  (αl,βl,γl,δl). Then multiplying by AT on the left we get a 4  ×  4 matrix equation

[formula]

the solution of which minimizes the residue ||Ax  -  b||22. This equation is then solved using the Gaussian elimination method.

This routine is used repeatedly at increasing r*, along with the computation of the integral in ([\ref=eq:A]), thus making the result more and more precise. Note that there is no direct check on the error of βl(ω). However, the fluctuations of its value strongly affecting Al(ω), we take the latter's good convergence as a guarantee for an acceptable error on βl(ω). A bit of monitoring at various stages of the computation confirms that the convergence of the βl(ω) value is a lot faster than that of the integral in ([\ref=eq:A]). Another source of confidence is the value Rl(ω) + Tl(ω) (see eq. ([\ref=eq:RT])) whose fluctuation around 1 also gives qualitative information on that error. In practice, we find a standard deviation of ~  10- 6 on the ω-grid.

The radiation amplitude Al(ω)

For simplicity we write A for Al(ω) since we describe the computation at a given value of ω and l. We use Numerov's method to integrate y-l in ([\ref=eq:HDE]). Starting at finite r*  ≪  0, the initial condition corresponding to ([\ref=eq:YIC]) is actually [formula] for some constants ak  =  O(1), at least for small k. We start at r*  =   - 700 because that's where r - 1 starts being computable (~  10- 300), in double precision. This allows us to neglect the correction to the initial condition ([\ref=eq:YIC]). Since the source term is also negligible at r*  =    -  O(100), the integral in ([\ref=eq:A]), which is computed in the same loop as y-l, does not need any corrections for stating at finite r* either. We use the trapezoidal rule for this integration because comparison with other Newton-Cotes formulae shows that it is the fastest method, in the sense that it starts approximating well at already big grid steps Δr*. This is due to the oscillatory nature of the integrand making positive and negative errors approximately compensate each other. The overall convergence is dramatically slow because the source term ([\ref=eq:S]) goes asymptotically as ~  r- 1 / 2. But the more we continue the more the integration's error grows. Therefore, we have to use a special method in order to extract that limit faster.

We define A(r*) as being the value of ([\ref=eq:A]) where the integral is truncated on the upper bound at r*, so that A  =   lim r*  →    ∞A(r*) (remember, the ω and l dependence is implicit here). On the actual r* k grid (the discretized axis), the computed sequence A(r* k) approximating that value gives a damped oscillation. We divide the r*-axis into intervals of length L which is given by a few typical periods 2π  /  ω and index them by [formula]. We choose to consider only the average value of A(r* k) out of every such interval, call it An (its phase φn), a new sequence sharing the same limit. So L is a smoothing parameter. We also calculate βl (and αl) at every n using the procedure described in section [\ref=sec:ab]. The routine stops when the last ten values of |An|2 and φn are all within an ε  =  10- 4 margin around their respective mean values and gives the latter as a result for A. The ε margin is actually a relative one for |A|2 whereas it is an absolute one for φ. Thus, if we let the greatest distances from the mean values be denoted by Δ(|A|2) and Δφ, the condition reads [formula] and Δφ  <  ε.

Once that loop has finished, we start all over again but with half the previous Δr* step. This goes on until the difference between two consecutive such computations is again less than ε (again, relative for |A|2 and absolute for φ). When finished, we pass to the next ω value.

As for the ω-grid parameters, let Δωl be the step and ωl,max be the maximum value for which we perform the previous computation. It appears that ωl,max  ~  (l + 1) is a good choice, as can be seen by looking at the Al(ω) plots (top left panels of figures [\ref=fig:l2] to [\ref=fig:l6]) where we have set (l + 1) / 2 for the maximum of the displayed ω axis. This is why we chose Δωl  =  6(l + 1)10- 5, so that the precision is the same for all l. However, we did not choose the ωl,max value to follow the ~  (l + 1) trend. We find instead that there is a natural limit on the ω axis for the convergence of the Al(ω) computation, given our precision criteria. After a given value for fl, apparently common to all l the program keeps dividing the Δr* step without ever meeting the required precision. Since the values at ω  ≫  1 are important for the computation of the tail of the waveform, we set the ωl,max value the higher we can, that is to that natural limit. This also sets l  =  6 as our limit for l, because the computation for l  =  7 would not give enough points for the spectrum at large frequencies.

The radiated waveform ψl(u) and energy spectrum integrals El,〈ω〉l and σl(ω)

We consider equations ([\ref=eq:wout]), ([\ref=eq:Etotl]), ([\ref=eq:mw]) and ([\ref=eq:sw]). We use a high order Newton-Cotes formula for their integration, the one with 7 stages and of order 8, named Weddle's formula. We also use Richardson's extrapolation on the integrals computed with steps Δω and 2Δω in order to further increase our precision.

For ψl(u), the l  =  2 case must be treated carefully because Al = 2(ω) diverges at the origin. It is true that, for any value of l, we can only compute Al(ω) for ω  >  0 because of the ω- 1 factor in the source term. However, we know from ([\ref=eq:Alf]) that Al = 3(ω  =  0) is finite and therefore deducible by extrapolation and Al > 3(ω  =  0)  =  0. For l = 2, the

[formula]

Extraction of the QNMs out of the signal

We know that the QNMs are getting more damped with increasing n. Thus, if we look far enough in the ringdown phase of the wave, the least damped mode (n  =  1) should dominate. However, the more we go at large u to look for the first mode the more the tail contribution becomes notable. So our fitting model is

[formula]

where the last term is an offset which can help compensate the shift due to the slowly appearing tail. It is really necessary for low l but becomes negligible for high l. Once we have found the first overtone (n  =  1), we subtract it from the waveform and reapply the fit seeking the second one (n  =  2) and so on.

Since there is no prescription for finding the ideal interval on the u axis to perform the fit we run a small program which tries all possible intervals in

[formula]

Error estimation

Radiated spectrum Al(ω) and fl(ω)

Almost all the computed points meet the precision criteria of section [\ref=sec:compA], meaning an estimated ~  10- 5 precision on |Al|2 and φ and therefore on |Al| and fl (remember that it is an absolute error for φ). The only exceptions are for l  ≥  4 where points with ω close to zero (ω  ~  10- 3) have an error of ~  10- 3. However, |Al| is very small there and the absolute error it causes in the calculation of El and ψl is thus negligible. In order to decrease it as much as possible anyway, we have extrapolated those regions using the analytical low frequency behavior discussed in section [\ref=sec:resAf].

As for the asymptotic behavior fits, in most cases such as in the high frequency region, there is no prescription for the ideal interval to fit on, so we estimate the error on the fitting parameters by their variation when fitting on different intervals. If, however, the number of points is small, leaving no choice about the fitting interval, the error corresponds to a 95% c.l.

Radiated energy spectrum characteristics (table [\ref=tab:Espec])

There are three types of error in the computation of the integrals El,〈ω〉l and σl(ω): the one due to the relative error on the integrand, noted δi, the one due to the discreteness of the integration domain, noted δd, and the one due to its finiteness, noted δf. δd is estimated by the relative difference of two integrations with grid steps Δω and 2Δω and δf is estimated using ([\ref=eq:Phf]). For El we have δi  ~  10- 5 since fl(ω)  ~  |Al(ω)|2, δd  ~  10- 7 and δf  ~  10- 8 so δ(El)  ~  10- 5. For 〈ω〉l and σl(ω), we use

[formula]

for the δi and find δi(〈ω〉l)  =  2.10- 4 and [formula]. The δd and δf are again smaller. Finally, for the maximum [formula] we record the smallest gap between its value and its direct neighbor's on the ω grid. However, this value is inside [formula], so the relative error for [formula] is also given by ε. For the error on [formula] we simply take half the ω grid step.
