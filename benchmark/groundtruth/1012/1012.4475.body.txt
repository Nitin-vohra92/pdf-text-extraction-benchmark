The robust PT-symmetric chain and properties of its Hermitian counterpart

Introduction: Since the seminal paper by Bender et al. [\cite=bender] a decade ago, it has become clear that non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with parity and time-reversal (PT)-symmetry can have purely real spectra [\cite=bender2] [\cite=bender3] and, with an appropriately redefined inner-product, they lead to orthogonal eigenvectors [\cite=bender2], unitary scattering [\cite=znojilsc] and, therefore, a consistent quantum theory. The theoretical work on continuum, PT-symmetric, non-Hermitian Hamiltonians [\cite=mostafa] since then has been accompanied, most recently, by experiments in optics where spontaneous PT-symmetry breaking in a classical system has been observed in waveguides with PT-symmetric complex refractive index [\cite=theory] [\cite=exp] and by theoretical studies of distributed-feedback optical structures that can be mapped onto a relativistic, PT-symmetric Hamiltonian [\cite=longhi].

Idealized lattice models have been popular in physics due to their analytical and numerical tractability, the absence of divergences [\cite=kogut], the availability of exact solutions [\cite=onsager], and the ability to capture counter-intuitive physical phenomena [\cite=winkler]. As with the standard quantum theory, these models have been based on Hermitian Hamiltonians. In recent years, tight-binding models with a Hermitian hopping and PT-symmetric, complex, on-site potentials [\cite=bendix] [\cite=song] [\cite=mark], non-Hermitian transitions [\cite=zno], and PT-symmetric spin-chains [\cite=pts] have been extensively explored. For a tight-binding chain with PT-symmetric impurity potentials, a salient result is that its PT-symmetric phase - the range of model parameters that lead to a real spectrum - is extremely fragile [\cite=bendix] [\cite=mark]. This fragile nature of the PT-symmetric phase precludes effects such as the Anderson localization [\cite=anderson], impurity-bound states [\cite=sasha], and the Luttinger-liquid behavior [\cite=luttinger] in such a chain with a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian.

In this paper, we explore the properties of a tight-binding chain of size N with PT-symmetric, non-Hermitian, position-dependent hopping amplitudes. Our main results are as follows: (i) We show that the system is always in the PT-symmetric phase under very general criteria that we derive. (ii) The energy spectrum and the resulting density of states in such a chain are widely tunable and symmetric around zero. (iii) Although the chain is not translationally invariant, (a majority of) its eigenfunctions are delocalized. Our results show that a robust PT-symmetric chain has non-Hermitian hopping amplitudes and Hermitian potentials, and that its Hamiltonian is similar to that of a chain with position-dependent, parity-symmetric hopping [\cite=gautam].

Tight-binding Model: We start with a Hamiltonian for an N-site tight-binding chain,

[formula]

where [formula] is the creation (annihilation) operator at site n, ti are the position-dependent hopping amplitudes, and the asterisk denotes complex conjugation. The parity operator on the chain is given by 〈m|P|n〉  =  δm,N + 1 - n  =  δm,n̄ where |m〉 represents a single-particle state localized at site m, and  = N + 1 - m is the reflection-counterpart of site m; it follows that HPT, although not Hermitian, is PT-symmetric. We consider only the single-particle sector and, since periodic boundary conditions are incompatible with the PT-symmetry, use open boundary conditions. Numerical results indicate that the spectrum of HPT is purely real when the hopping elements have the same sign; in the following paragraph, we analytically derive the criteria that guarantee this robustness.

Let us consider a similarity transformation [\cite=mostafa] of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, HPT  →  H = M- 1HPTM where [formula] is a diagonal matrix. It is straightforward to show that the transformed matrix H is Hermitian, [formula], if and only if

[formula]

We note that this constraint only applies to a diagonal M. Thus, the PT-symmetric Hamiltonian HPT is similar to a Hermitian Hamiltonian H if and only if the phases of the hopping amplitudes (tk,tN - k) are the same for all [formula]. When the hopping elements are real, it implies that tk and tN - k must have the same sign; when they are complex, tm = |tm| exp (iθm), it implies that θk  =  θN - k. The eigenvalue spectrum of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian HPT is purely real, as long as these general requirements are satisfied. Since [formula], it follows that the eigenvalues En of H and HPT are the same, and that the orthogonal eigenvectors of H, H|vn〉 = En|vn〉, and the (non-orthogonal) eigenvectors of the PT-symmetric Hamiltonian, HPT|un〉  =  En|un〉 are related by |un〉 = M|vn〉. This relation provides the requisite inner-product under which the eigenvectors |un〉 of HPT are orthonormalized. We note this transformation corresponds to the positive-definite, self-adjoint, invertible metric [formula] [\cite=pts].

The hopping amplitudes for atomic orbitals can be, in general, complex [\cite=slater]. However, for optical lattices, coupled waveguides, or superlattices, the hopping amplitude, determined by the overlap of adjacent on-site (Gaussian or exponential) ground-state wavefunctions, is positive, just as it is for s-wave atomic orbitals [\cite=slater]. A truly non-Hermitian Hamiltonian HPT may be realized in systems with asymmetrical hopping due to an in-plane field [\cite=hatano] or a voltage bias [\cite=beloch]. Its Hermitian counterpart H, with position-dependent, parity symmetric hopping, may be realized in evanescently coupled waveguides where the wavepacket evolution and two-particle quantum correlations are exquisitely sensitive to the hopping [\cite=gautam].

Note that Eq.([\ref=eq:constraint]), although dependent upon the underlying Hamiltonian HPT, does not uniquely determine the transformation matrix M or the Hermitian matrix H. For simplicity, we choose M to be real and m1 = 1 which implies, via [formula], that mN = 1. The resulting real matrix M commutes individually with the parity- and time-reversal operators. Since numerical diagonalization of a Hermitian matrix H is faster and more accurate than its non-Hermitian counterpart HPT, in numerical calculations we use its Hermitian counterpart H with entries

[formula]

where we recall that θN - n  =  θn. In the following sections, we discuss basic properties of such a chain, with focus on the energy spectrum and nature of wavefunctions of H when the hopping is not uniform.

Energy Spectrum and Density of States: We start with numerical results for an N = 500 site chain with hopping amplitude given by tk  =  t0kα where t0 sets the hopping-energy scale. When α = 0, we have a uniform tight-binding chain, the energy spectrum is given by En  =   - 2t0 cos (kn) where kn = nπ / (N + 1) for an open chain, and the density of states [formula] diverges near the band edges x =   ±  1, where x = E / (2t0) and θ(x) is the Heaviside function. The left panel in Fig. [\ref=fig:band] shows the cosine-spectrum for α = 0 (black solid line), a linear spectrum that is obtained when α = 1 (green dotted line), and nonlinear spectra obtained when α = 2 (red dashed line) and α =  - 1 (blue dot-dashed line). As is expected for a tight-binding model, the energy spectra are symmetric around zero [\cite=staggered]. These results show that the energy spectrum of the PT-symmetric chain can be widely tuned. We note that when α < 0, the eigenstates near the top and the bottom of the energy band are localized at the two ends of the chain.

The right panel in Fig. [\ref=fig:band] shows the corresponding (un-normalized) densities of states ρα(E). It is clear that the density of states changes dramatically from ρ0(E) (black solid line) when α  ≠  0. When α = 1, due to the linear spectrum, the density of states is constant. It develops a single peak at E = 0 and tapers off to a finite value at the band edges when α > 1. In contrast, when α < 0, it develops two symmetrical peaks and vanishes at the band edges for N  →    ∞  . We emphasize that when α  ≠  0, the system is not translationally invariant and therefore the quantum number n is not associated with the momentum.

We now focus on α = 1 or equivalently tk = t0k for [formula]. The band-edges in this case are given by ±  E0  =    ±  (N - 1)t0 and the uniform level-spacing is ΔE = En + 1 - En = 2t0. It follows from Eq.([\ref=eq:hpt]) that the recurrence relation satisfied by the coefficients of an eigenfunction [formula] of HPT is

[formula]

It is easy to check that fGk = CN - 1k - 1 = (N - 1)! / (k - 1)!(N - k)! satisfies Eq.([\ref=eq:rr]) with eigenvalue EG =  - (N - 1)t0. Thus the ground-state wavefunction is [formula]. Note that for k  ~  N / 2  ≫  1, Stirling approximation implies that the ground-state wavefunction is Gaussian near the center of the chain, fGk  ~   exp [ -  (k  -  N  /  2)2  /  2N2]. The first excited-state wavefunction is given by f1k  =  (N + 1 - 2k)fGk. It has energy - (N - 3)t0, and Stirling approximation shows that in the large N-limit, it carries over to the wavefunction for the first excited state of a simple harmonic oscillator. It is straightfoward, but tedious, to construct the higher excited states. We emphasize that for every eigenstate with energy - E < 0, the eigenstate with energy + E > 0 is given by its staggered version: fk  →  ( - 1)kfk [\cite=staggered].

When α  ≠  {0,1} an analytical solution for the eigenvalue spectrum HPT, or equivalently H, is unknown. However, the results in Fig. [\ref=fig:band] for α > 0 can be qualitatively understood with the simplest example of a non-trivial, symmetric, tridiagonal matrix H with real entries {a,b,b,a} above the diagonal. The matrix H is similar to a PT-symmetric Hamiltonian HPT of a 5-site chain with hopping parameters {t1,t2,t3,t4} with [formula] and [formula]. The eigenvalues of such a matrix are given by [formula]. For a position dependent hopping tk = t0kα, when α = 0 the slope of the energy spectrum at the band-edge is smaller than that at the origin, when α = 1 we get the linear spectrum, and for α > 1, the slope of the spectrum at the band-edge is larger than that at the origin.

Localized and Extended Wavefunctions: The PT-symmetric chain with a position-dependent hopping is not translationally invariant, and when α  ≠  {0,1} its eigenfunctions are not analytically known. To study the evolution of the spatial extent of a wavefunction [formula] with increasing system size N, we calculate the inverse participation ratio (IPR) [\cite=wegner]

[formula]

If the IPR remains finite as N  →    ∞  , the wavefunction is localized whereas for an extended state, [formula] where η > 0; for a uniform tight-binding chain, α = 0, the IPR(N) = 3 / N for all eigenstates. Note that the IPRs for eigenstates with energies ±  E are the same. The left-panel in Fig. [\ref=fig:ipr] shows the evolution of the maximum and minimum values of IPR for a chain with N = 10-5000 as a function of α  ≥  0. Note that since the chain size and the IPRs span decades, we use the logarithmic scale in Fig. [\ref=fig:ipr]. When α = 0 (black solid circles) we obtain the analytical result, IPR(N) = 3 / N. When α > 0, we see that both the minimum and maximum IPRs decay with increasing chain size, max IPR [formula] and min IPR [formula] where 0 < ηα  <  γα < 1, and both exponents ηα and γα are monotonically decreasing functions of α. These results strongly suggest that all eigenstates of the Hamiltonian H with position-dependent hopping [formula] are extended when α  ≥  0. The right panel shows corresponding results for α  ≤  0. The minimum IPR is essentially independent of α. On the other hand, in a sharp contrast with the previous results, we see that the maximum IPR quickly saturates to a nonzero value and indicates a localized state. Thus, when α < 0, the system has both extended and localized eigenfunctions. We note that these exponentially localized states, at the two ends of the chain, are essentially degenerate in energy; so are their staggered counterparts [\cite=staggered]. Thus, there are at least four eigenstates that have the same nonzero IPR. The qualitative difference between α > 0 and α < 0 cases can be attributed to the hopping: when α > 0, the hopping amplitude increases from ~  t0Nα / 2 at the two edges to ~  t0Nα at the center of the chain, whereas when α < 0, the hopping amplitude decreases from ~  t0 / N|α| / 2 at the edges to ~  t0 / N|α| at its center.

A better insight into the number of localized states is provided by the dependence of the IPR distribution on the size N of the chain. Figure [\ref=fig:iprdist] shows the histogram of IPRs for α = 1 (left column) and α =  - 1 (right column). When α = 1, as N is increased tenfold from N = 500 (bottom-left panel) to N = 5000 (top-left panel), the entire IPR distribution shifts to smaller values. In contrast, when α =  - 1, even as N is increased tenfold, the IPR values for a few (localized edge) states, indicated by the red oval, are unchanged while the IPRs for the rest shift to lower values.

Discussion: PT-symmetric lattices with a uniform hopping and imaginary impurities have an extremely fragile PT-symmetric phase [\cite=bendix] [\cite=mark]. In this paper, we have presented a tight-binding model with non-Hermitian, PT-symmetric hopping, Eq.([\ref=eq:hpt]). We have shown that, under very general circumstances, this model is always in the PT-symmetric phase, and its Hamiltonian is similar to a Hermitian Hamiltonian with position-dependent nearest-neighbor hopping, Eq.([\ref=eq:hh]) [\cite=gautam]. These results are unaffected by the presence of ubiquitous, on-site, Hermitian disorder since it does not induce PT-symmetry breaking.

Given the robust nature of the PT-symmetric phase in this chain, we have explored its energy spectrum, density of states, nature of eigenfunctions, and their dependence on the functional form of the hopping amplitude tk = t0kα. We find that when α = 1 the energy spectrum is linear and gives rise to a constant density of states. We show that the energy spectrum is widely tunable by changing α. We find that when α < 0 the system has both localized and extended eigenfunctions in the absence of disorder, whereas when α > 0, all eigenfunctions are extended. The effect of a Hermitian on-site disorder, then, is identical to that in a regular tight-binding model [\cite=anderson] [\cite=wegner]. Thus, the physics of the robust PT-symmetric chain with non-Hermitian hopping is extremely rich.
