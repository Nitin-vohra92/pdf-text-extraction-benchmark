Introduction

The following theorem is the main result in [\cite=MN].

Let D be a bounded domain in [formula] and let f be a continuous mapping of [formula] into [formula] which is quasiconformal in D. Suppose that, for some M  >  0 and 0  <  α  ≤  1,

[formula]

whenever x and y lie on ∂D. Then

[formula]

for all x and y on [formula], where β  =   min (α,K1 / (1  -  n)I) and [formula] depends only on M, α, n, K(f) and (D).

The exponent β is the best possible, as the example of a radial quasiconformal map f(x)  =  |x|α  -  1x, 0  <  α  <  1, of [formula] onto itself shows (see [\cite=Va], p. 49). Also, the assumption of boundedness is essential. Indeed, one can consider g(x)  =  |x|ax, |x|  ≥  1 where a  >  0. Then g is quasiconformal in [formula] (see [\cite=Va], p. 49), it is identity on ∂D and hence Lipschitz continuous on ∂D. However, [formula], t  →    ∞  , and therefore g is not globally Lipschitz continuous on D.

This paper deals with the following question, suggested by P. Koskela: is it possible to replace β with α if we assume, in addition to quasiconformality, that f is harmonic? In the special case [formula] this was proved, for arbitrary moduli of continuity ω(δ), in [\cite=ABM]. Our main result is that the answer is positive, if ∂D is a uniformly perfect set (cf. [\cite=JV]). In fact, we prove a more general result, including domains having a thin, in the sense of capacity, portion of the boundary. However, this generality is in a sense illusory, because any harmonic and quasiconformal (briefly hqc) mapping extends harmonically and quasiconformally across such portion of the boundary. Nevertheless, it leads to a natural open question: is the answer positive for arbitrary bounded domain in [formula]?

In the case of smooth boundaries much better regularity up to the boundary can be deduced, see [\cite=Ka]; related results for harmonic functions were obtained by [\cite=Ai].

We denote by B(x,r) and S(x,r) the open ball, respectively sphere, in [formula] with center x and radius r > 0. We adopt the basic notation, terminology and definitions related to quasiconformal maps from [\cite=Va]. A condenser is a pair (K,U), where K is a non-empty compact subset of an open set [formula]. The capacity of the condenser (K,U) is defined as

[formula]

where infimum is taken over all continuous real-valued [formula] such that u(x)  =  1 for x∈K and u(x)  =  0 for [formula]. In fact, one can replace the ACLn condition with Lipschitz continuity in this definition. We note that, for a compact [formula] and open bounded sets U1 and U2 containing K we have: (K,U1)  =  0 iff (K,U2)  =  0, therefore the notion of a compact set of zero capacity is well defined (see [\cite=Vu], Remarks 7.13) and we can write (K)  =  0 in this situation. For the notion of the modulus M(Γ) of a family Γ of curves in [formula] we refer to [\cite=Va] and [\cite=Vu]. These two notions are related: by results of [\cite=He] and [\cite=Zi] we have

[formula]

where Δ(E,F;G) denotes the family of curves connecting E to F within G, see [\cite=Va] or [\cite=Vu] for details.

In addition to this notion of capacity, related to quasiconformal mappings, we need Wiener capacity, related to harmonic functions. For a compact [formula], n  ≥  3, it is defined by

[formula]

where infimum is taken over all Lipschitz continuous compactly supported functions u on [formula] such that u  =  1 on K. Let us note that every compact [formula] which has capacity zero has Wiener capacity zero. Indeed, choose an open ball BR  =  B(0,R)  ⊃  K. Since n  ≥  2 we have, by Hölder inequality,

[formula]

for any Lipschitz continuous u vanishing outside U, our claim follows immediately from definitions.

A compact set [formula], consisting of at least two points, is α-uniformly perfect (α  >  0) if there is no ring R separating K (i.e. such that both components of [formula] intersect K) such that (R)  >  α. We say that a compact [formula] is uniformly perfect if it is α-uniformly perfect for some α  >  0.

We denote the α-dimensional Hausdorff measure of a set [formula] by Λα(F).

The main result

In this section D denotes a bounded domain in [formula], n  ≥  3. Let

[formula]

and [formula]. Using this notation we can state our main result.

Assume [formula] is continuous on [formula], harmonic and quasiconformal in D. Assume f is Hölder continuous with exponent α, 0  <  α  ≤  1, on ∂D and Γ1 is uniformly perfect. Then f is Hölder continuous with exponent α on [formula].

If Γ0 is empty we obtain the following

If [formula] is continuous on [formula], Hölder continuous with exponent α, 0  <  α  ≤  1, on ∂D, harmonic and quasiconformal in D and if ∂D is uniformly perfect, then f is Hölder continuous with exponent α on [formula].

The first step in proving Theorem [\ref=my21] is reduction to the case [formula]. In fact, we show that existence of a hqc extension of f across Γ0 follows from well known results. Let [formula]. Then [formula] is an open set in [formula], Γ0 is a closed subset of [formula] and [formula].

Clearly [formula] for each compact [formula], and therefore, by Lemma 7.14 in [\cite=Vu], [formula] for each α  >  0. In particular, Γ0 has σ-finite (n - 1)-dimensional Hausdorff measure. Since it is closed in [formula], we can apply Theorem 35.1 in [\cite=Va] to conclude that f has a quasiconformal extension F across Γ0 which has the same quasiconformality constant as f.

Since Γ0 is a countable union of compact subsets Kj of capacity zero and hence of Wiener capacity zero we conclude that Γ0 has Wiener capacity zero. Hence, by a classical result (see [\cite=Car]), there is a (unique) extension [formula] of f which is harmonic in [formula]. Obviously, F  =  G is a harmonic quasiconformal extension of f to [formula] which has the same quasiconformality constant as f.

In effect, we reduced the proof of Theorem [\ref=my21] to the proof of Corollary [\ref=myc22]. We begin the proof of Corollary [\ref=myc22] with the following

Let [formula] be a bounded domain with uniformly perfect boundary. There exists a constant m  >  0 such that for every y∈D we have

[formula]

Proof. Fix y∈D as above and z∈∂D such that [formula] Clearly diam(∂D)  =  diam(D) > 2r  . Set [formula] and [formula], F3  =  S(z,2r)  . Let [formula] for i,j = 1,2,3. By [\cite=JV] there exists a constant a = a(E,n) > 0 such that

[formula]

while by standard estimates [\cite=Va] there exists b = b(n) > 0 such that

[formula]

Next, by [\cite=Vu] there exists m = m(E,n) > 0 such that

[formula]

Finally, with [formula] we have

[formula]

[formula]

In conclusion, from the above lemma, our assumption

[formula]

and Lemma 8 in [\cite=MN] we conclude that there is a constant M, depending on m, n, K(f), C and α only such that

[formula]

However, an argument presented in [\cite=MN] shows that the above estimate holds for y∈D, x∈∂D without any further conditions, but with possibly different constant:

[formula]

The following lemma was proved in [\cite=CK] for real valued functions, but the proof relies on the maximum principle which holds also for vector valued harmonic functions, hence lemma holds for harmonic mappings as well.

Assume [formula] is continuous on [formula] and harmonic in D. Assume for each x0∈∂D we have

[formula]

Then |h(x)  -  h(y)|  ≤  ω(|x - y|) whenever x,y∈D and |x - y|  ≤  r0.

Now we combine ([\ref=bdryest]) and the above lemma, with r0  =  (D), to complete the proof of Corollary [\ref=myc22] and therefore of Theorem [\ref=my21] as well.
