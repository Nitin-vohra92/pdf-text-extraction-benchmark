Weak and strong moments of random vectors

Introduction

Let X be a random vector with values in some normed space [formula]. The question we will discuss is how to estimate [formula] for p  ≥  1. Obviously [formula] and for any continuous linear functional φ on F with [formula] we have [formula]. It turns out that in some situations one may reverse these obvious estimates and show that for an absolute constant C and any p  ≥  1,

[formula]

This is for example the case when X has Gaussian or product exponential distribution. In this note we will concentrate on the more general case of log-concave vectors.

A measure μ on [formula] is called logarithmically concave (log-concave in short) if for any compact nonempty sets [formula] and λ∈(0,1),

[formula]

By the result of Borell [\cite=Bo] a measure μ on [formula] with full dimensional support is log-concave if and only if it is absolutely continuos with respect to the Lebesgue measure and has a density of the form e- f, where [formula] is a convex function. Log-concave measures are frequently studied in convex geometry, since by the Brunn-Minkowski inequality uniform distributions on convex bodies as well as their lower dimensional marginals are log-concave. In fact the class of log-concave measures on [formula] is the smallest class of probability measures closed under linear transformation and weak limits that contains uniform distributions on convex bodies. Vectors with logaritmically concave distributions are called log-concave.

In the sequel we discuss the following conjecture posed in a stronger form in [\cite=LW] about the comparison of strong and weak moment for log-concave vectors.

For any n dimensional log-concave random vector and any norm [formula] on [formula] we have for 1  ≤  p <   ∞  ,

[formula]

where C1 and C2 are absolute constants.

In Section 2 we gather known results about validity of [\eqref=weak_strong] in special cases. Section 3 is devoted to the unconditional vectors. In particular we show that Conjecture [\ref=ws_conj] is satisfied under additional assumption of unconditionality of X and bounded cotype constant of the underlying normed space.

Notation

Let (εi) be a Bernoulli sequence, i.e. a sequence of independent symmetric variables taking values ±  1. We assume that (εi) are independent of other random variables.

By (Ei) we denote a sequence of independent symmetric exponential random variables with variance 1 (i.e. the density [formula]). We set [formula] for an n-dimensional random vector with product exponential distribution and identity covariance matrix.

By 〈  ·  ,  ·  〉 we denote the standard scalar product on [formula] and by (ei) the standard basis of [formula]. We set Bnp for a unit ball in [formula], i.e. [formula]. For a random variable Y and p > 0 we write [formula].

We write C (resp. C(α)) to denote universal constants (resp. constants depending only on parameter α). Value of a constant C may differ at each occurence.

Known results

Since any norm on [formula] may be approximated by a supremum of exponential number of functionals we get

For any n-dimensional random vector X inequality [\eqref=weak_strong] holds for p  ≥  n with C1 = 0 and C2 = 10.

It is also easy to reduce Conjecture [\ref=ws_conj] to the case of symmetric vectors.

Suppose that [\eqref=weak_strong] holds for all symmetric n-dimensional log-concave vectors X. Then it is also satisfied with constants 4C1 + 1 and 4C2 by all log-concave vectors X.

Assume first that X has a log-concave distribution and [formula]. Let X' be an independent copy of X, then X - X' is symmetric and log-concave. Moreover for p  ≥  1,

[formula]

and for any functional φ,

[formula]

Hence [\eqref=weak_strong] holds for X with constant 2C1 and 2C2.

If X is arbitrary log-concave then [formula] is log-concave with mean zero. We have for any p  ≥  1,

[formula]

and for any functional φ,

[formula]

Gaussian concentration inequality easily implies [\eqref=weak_strong] for Gaussian vectors X (see for example Chapter 3 of [\cite=LT]). For Rademacher sums comparability of weak and strong moments was established by Dilworth and Montgomery-Smith [\cite=DMS]. More general statement was shown in [\cite=L3].

Suppose that [formula], where vi∈F and ξi are independent symmetric r.v's with logarithmically concave tails. Then for any p  ≥  1 inequality [\eqref=weak_strong] holds with absolute constants C1 and C2.

This immediately implies

Conjecture [\ref=ws_conj] holds under additional assumption that coordinates of X are independent.

We have [formula] with Xi independent log-concave real random variables. It is enough to notice that variables Xi have log-concave tails and in the symmetric case apply Theorem [\ref=ind_sum]. General independent case may be reduce to the symmetric one as in the proof of Proposition [\ref=symmetrization].

The crucial tool in the proof of Theorem [\ref=ind_sum] is the Talagrand two-level concentration inequality for the product exponential distribution [\cite=Ta1]:

[formula]

where ν is the symmetric exponential distribution, i.e. [formula].

In [\cite=LW] more general concentration inequalities were investigated. For a probability measure μ on [formula] define

[formula]

and

[formula]

One may show that [formula]. Argument presented in [\cite=LW] gives

Suppose that for some α  ≥  1 and β > 0 and any convex symmetric compact set [formula] we have

[formula]

Then inequality [\eqref=weak_strong] holds with C1  =  α and C2 = Cβ.

In [\cite=LW] it was shown that concentration inequality [\eqref=conc] holds with α = 1 for symmetric product log-concave measures and for uniform distributions on Bnr balls. This gives

Inequality [\eqref=weak_strong] holds with C1 = 1 and universal C2 for uniform distributions on Bnr balls 1  ≤  r  ≤    ∞  .

Modification of Paouris' proof [\cite=Pa] of large deviation inequality for [formula] norm of isotropic log-concave vectors shows that weak and strong moments are comparable in the Euclidean case (see [\cite=ALLPT] for details):

If X is a log-concave n-dimensional random vector then for any Euclidean norm [formula] on [formula] we have

[formula]

Unconditional case

We say that a random vector [formula] has unconditional distribution if the distribution of [formula] is the same as X for any choice of signs [formula]. Random vector X is called isotropic if it has identity covariance matrix, i.e. [formula].

Suppose that X is an n-dimensional isotropic, unconditional, log-concave vector. Then for any norm [formula] on [formula] and p  ≥  1,

[formula]

Let [formula] be the unit ball in the space [formula] dual to [formula]. Then [formula]. By the result of Talagrand [\cite=Ta2] (see also [\cite=Ta]) there exist subsets Tn  ⊂  T and functions πn:T  →  Tn, [formula] such that πn(t)  →  t for all t∈T, #  T0 = 1, #  Tn  ≤  22n and

[formula]

Let us fix p  ≥  1 and choose n0  ≥  1 such that 2n0 - 1 < 2p  ≤  2n0. We have

[formula]

We get

[formula]

To estimate the last term in [\eqref=split] notice that for u  ≥  16 we have by Chebyshev's inequality

[formula]

Integrating by parts this gives

[formula]

The result of Bobkov and Nazarov [\cite=BN] gives

[formula]

Thus the statement follows by [\eqref=Talmaj]-[\eqref=summand2].

In some situation one may show that [formula]. This is the case of spaces with bounded cotype constant.

Suppose that 2  ≤  q <   ∞  , [formula] is a finite dimensional space with a q-cotype constant bounded by β  <    ∞  . Then for any n-dimensional unconditional, log-concave vector X and p  ≥  1,

[formula]

where C(q,β) is a constant that depends only on q and β.

Applying diagonal transformation (and appropriately changing the norm) we may assume that X is also isotropic.

By the result of Maurey and Pisier [\cite=MP] (see also Appendix II in [\cite=MS]) one has

[formula]

By the unconditionality of X and Jensen's inequality we get

[formula]

We have [formula], therefore

[formula]

and the statement follows by Theorem [\ref=uncond].

For general norm on [formula] one has

[formula]

This together with the similar argument as in the proof of Corollary [\ref=cotype] gives the following.

For any n-dimensional unconditional, log-concave vector X, any norm [formula] on [formula] and p  ≥  1 one has

[formula]
