Static Klein-Gordon-Maxwell-Proca systems in 4-dimensional closed manifolds

Static Klein-Gordon-Maxwell-Proca systems are massive versions of the electrostatic Klein-Gordon-Maxwell Systems. The vector field in these systems inherits a mass and is governed by the Proca action which generalizes that of Maxwell. Klein-Gordon-Maxwell systems are intended to provide a dualistic model for the description of the interaction between a charged relativistic matter scalar field and the electromagnetic field that it generates. The electromagnetic field is both generated by and drives the particle field. In the electrostatic form of the Klein-Gordon-Maxwell systems, looking for standing waves ueiωt, the matter field is characterized by the property that u, together with a gauge potential v, solve the electrostatic Klein-Gordon-Maxwell systems [\eqref=SWSyst] with m1  =  0. In the case of a closed manifold we discuss here the two equations in [\eqref=SWSyst] are independent one of another when m1  =  0 and the system reduces to the sole Schrödinger equation. The Proca formalism, for m1  >  0, leads to a deeper phenomenon and is more appropriate to the closed case. The particle in this model interacts via the minimum coupling rule

[formula]

with an external massive vector field (φ,A) which is governed by the Maxwell-Proca Lagrangian. The Proca action is a gauge-fixed version of the Stueckelberg action in the Higgs mechanism (see Goldhaber and Nieto [\cite=GolNie2], and Ruegg and Ruiz-Altaba [\cite=RueRui]). In the Proca formalism, developped under the influence of de Broglie, the photon inherits a nonzero mass. This issue is of considerable importance and intensively studied in modern physics (see for instance Adelberger, Dvali and Gruzinov [\cite=AdeDvaGru], Byrne [\cite=Byr], Goldhaber and Nieto [\cite=GolNie1] [\cite=GolNie2], Luo and Tu [\cite=LuoTu], Luo, Gillies and Tu [\cite=LuoGilTu] and the references in these papers). When n  =  3, the KGMP equations consist in the nonlinear Klein-Gordon matter equation, the charge continuity equation and the massive modified Maxwell equations in SI units, which are hereafter explicitly written down:

[formula]

These massive Maxwell equations, as modified to Proca form, appear to have been first written in modern format by Schrödinger [\cite=Sch]. The Proca formalism a priori breaks Gauge invariance. Gauge invariance can be restaured by the Stueckelberg trick, as pointed out by Pauli [\cite=Pau], and then by the Higgs mechanism. We refer to Goldhaber and Nieto [\cite=GolNie2], Luo, Gillies and Tu [\cite=LuoGilTu], and Ruegg and Ruiz-Altaba [\cite=RueRui] for very complete references on the Proca approach.

In what follows we let (M,g) be a smooth compact 3,4-dimensional Riemannian manifold. We let also [formula] be the critical Sobolev exponent, where n is the dimension of M. Given real numbers q  >  0, m0,m1  >  0, ω∈( - m0,m0), and [formula], the derivation of the Klein-Gordon-Maxwell-Proca system we investigate in this paper is written as

[formula]

where [formula] is the Laplace-Beltrami operator. The system [\eqref=SWSyst] corresponds to looking for standing waves ueiωt for the full KGMP system in the static case where the massive vector field (φ,A) depends on the sole spatial variable. The system is energy critical when n  =  3 and p  =  6 and when n  =  4 and p  =  4. It is subcritical otherwise, namely when n  =  3 and p∈(2,6) or n = 4 and p∈(2,4). In the above model, m1 is a coupling constant which makes that the two equations in [\eqref=SWSyst] are trully coupled (m1 is the Proca mass in the Maxwell-Proca formalism) while m0 is the mass of the particle, q is the charge of the particle, u is the amplitude in the writing of the particle, ω is its temporal frequency (referred to as the phase in the sequel), and v is the electric potential.

Let Sg stand for the scalar curvature of g, and Sp(ω) be the set consisting of the positive smooth solutions U  =  (u,v) of [\eqref=SWSyst] with phase ω and nonlinear term up - 1. Namely,

[formula]

Given [formula]. When p  =  6 assume

[formula]

for all x∈M. Then [\eqref=SWSyst] possesses a smooth positive MPT solution. Moreover, for any p∈(2,6), and any θ∈(0,1), there exists C > 0 such that for any [formula], and any [formula], ||U||C2,θ  ≤  C, where [formula] is as in [\eqref=DefSp] and K0(0) is as in [\eqref=DefKOm0]. Assuming again [\eqref=MainAssumpt0], there also holds that for any θ∈(0,1), ||U||C2,θ  ≤  C for all [formula] and all [formula], where C  >  0 does not depend on [formula] and U.

This result exhibits phase compensation in the 3-dimensional case. We aim in this paper in proving that a similar phenomenon holds true when n  =  4. In this dimension the second equation in [\eqref=SWSyst] becomes critical and this leads to serious difficulties. We prove below the existence of smooth positive MPT solutions and the existence of uniform bounds for [\eqref=SWSyst] in the subcritical cases p∈(2,4) without any conditions, and in the critical case p = 4 assuming that the mass potential, balanced by the phase, is smaller than the geometric threshold potential of the conformal Laplacian. In doing so we prove that phase compensation still holds true for our systems when n  =  4. Our result, in the subcritical case, is as follows.

Let (M,g) be a smooth compact 4-dimensional Riemannian manifold, q  >  0, m0,m1  >  0, ω∈( - m0,m0), and p∈(2,4). Then [\eqref=SWSyst] possesses a smooth positive MPT solution. Moreover, for any θ∈(0,1), there exists C > 0 such that for any [formula], and any [formula], ||U||C2,θ  ≤  C, where [formula] is as in [\eqref=DefSp] and K0(0) is as in [\eqref=DefKOm0].

In the critical case we prove the following result. The geometry of the ambiant inhomogeneous space, through the scalar curvature of g, comes to play a role as in the 3-dimensional case. However, the result now turns out to be local in its existence part.

Let (M,g) be a smooth compact 4-dimensional Riemannian manifold, q  >  0, m0,m1  >  0, ω∈( - m0,m0), and p = 4. Assume

[formula]

for some x∈M. Then [\eqref=SWSyst] possesses a smooth positive MPT solution. Assuming that [\eqref=MainAssumpt] holds true for all x∈M there also holds that for any θ∈(0,1), ||U||C2,θ  ≤  C for all [formula] and all [formula], where C  >  0 does not depend on [formula] and U, [formula] is as in [\eqref=DefSp], and K0(ω) is as in [\eqref=DefKOm0].

There are two consequences to Theorem [\ref=Thm2]. We list them in points (i)-(ii) below. In point (i) we illustrate the phase compensation effect associated with [\eqref=SWSyst]. There we always get existence and a priori bounds for all phases ω which are close to m0. Point (ii) concerns the full range of phases when we assume m0 is not too large.

(i) Phase compensation in the critical case - Assume p  =  4 and Sg  >  0 in M. Then there exists ε  >  0 such that for any m0  -  ε  <  |ω|  <  m0, [\eqref=SWSyst] possesses a smooth positive MPT solution. Moreover, for any θ∈(0,1), there exists C  >  0 such that ||U||C2,θ  ≤  C for all U∈S4(ω) and all m0  -  ε  <  |ω|  <  m0.

(iii) Full phase range in the critical case - Assume p  =  4 and [formula] in M. For any ω∈( - m0,m0), [\eqref=SWSyst] possesses a smooth positive MPT solution. Moreover, for any θ∈(0,1), there exists C  >  0 such that ||U||C2,θ  ≤  C for all U∈S4(ω) and all ω∈( - m0,m0).

As an immediate consequence of the C2,θ-bounds in the above results we obtain phase stability for standing waves of the Klein-Gordon-Maxwell-Proca equations in electrostatic form. Standing waves for the Klein-Gordon-Maxwell-Proca equations in electrostatic form are written as S  =  ueiωt and they are coupled with a gauge potential v, where (u,v) solves [\eqref=SWSyst]. Roughly speaking, phase stability means that for any arbitrary sequence of standing waves uαeiωαt, with gauge potentials vα, the convergence of the phases ωα in [formula] implies the convergence of the amplitudes uα and of the gauge potentials vα in the C2-topology. Phase stability prevents the existence of arbitrarily large amplitude standing waves.

High dimensional KGM systems in Coulomb gauge have been recently investigated by Rodnianski and Tao [\cite=RodTao] and with special emphasis in (1 + 4)-dimensions by Klainerman and Tataru [\cite=KlaTat] and Selberg [\cite=Sel]. Electrostatic KGM systems in the three dimensional case have been investigated by several authors. Possible references on the physics side are by Benci and Fortunato [\cite=BenFor0] [\cite=BenFor], Long [\cite=Lon], Long and Stuart [\cite=LonStu]. Blowing-up solutions to the electrostatic Schrödinger-Maxwell system, a cousin of the electrostaic KGM type systems that we consider here, have been constructed in D'Aprile and Wei [\cite=AprWei1] [\cite=AprWei2].

We briefly discuss in Section [\ref=PhysSec] the physics relevance of [\eqref=SWSyst]. We prove our theorem in Sections [\ref=ExistTheory] to [\ref=Apriori2]. The existence part in the theorem is proved in Section [\ref=ExistTheory]. The C2,θ-bound in the subcritical case is established in Section [\ref=Apriori1]. The more delicate C2,θ-bound in the critical case is established in Sections [\ref=Apriori2] . The phase compensation phenomenon in the theorem holds true thanks to the 4-dimensional log effect μ2  =  o(μ2 log μ) as μ  →  0.

The physics origin of the system

The Klein-Gordon-Maxwell-Proca system discussed in this work describes an interacting field theory model in theoretical physics. Most electromagnetic phenomena are described by conventional electrodynamics, which is a theory of the coupling of electromagnetic fields to matter fields. Of prime importance for particle physics is fermion electrodynamics in which matter is represented by spinor fields. However one may have also boson electrodynamics in which matter is described by integer spin or bosonic fields. The simplest one is of course the complex scalar field, describing spinless particles having electric charges ±  q. It gives rise to scalar electrodynamics, which describes in the non-relativistic limit the superconductivity of metals at very low temperatures. In the more general context of particle physics, a complex scalar field ψ may serve to describe scalar mesons in nuclear matter interacting via a massive vector boson field (φ,A).

The interaction in this model is described by the minimum substitution rule [\eqref=MinSubsRule] in a nonlinear Klein-Gordon Lagrangian. As for the external massive vector field it is governed by the Maxwell-Proca Lagrangian. More precisely, assuming for short that the manifold is orientable, we define the Lagrangian densities LNKG and LMP of ψ, φ, and A by

[formula]

where [formula], [formula] is the Hodge dual, ψ represents the matter complex scalar field, m0 its mass, q its charge, (φ,A) the electromagnetic vector field, and m1 its mass. It can be noted that ||(φ,A)||2L  =  |φ|2  -  |A|2 is the square of the Lorentz norm of (φ,A) with respect to the Lorentz metric [formula]. The total action functional for ψ, φ, and A is then given by

[formula]

Writing ψ in polar form as ψ(x,t)  =  u(x,t)eiS(x,t), taking the variation of S with respect to u, S, φ, and A, we get four equations which are written as

[formula]

where [formula] is the Laplace-Beltrami operator, [formula] is half the Laplacian acting on forms, and δ is the codifferential. We refer to this system as a nonlinear Klein-Gordon-Maxwell-Proca system. When n  =  3, [formula] and if we let

[formula]

then the two last equations in [\eqref=EqtLagAct5] give rise to the first pair of the Maxwell-Proca equations [\eqref=MaxwellProca] with ε0  =  μ0  =  1 (units are chosen such that c  =  1) and μ2  =  m21, while the two first equations in [\eqref=EqtLagAct6] give rise to the second pair of the equations. The first equation in [\eqref=EqtLagAct5] gives rise to the nonlinear Klein-Gordon matter equation. The second equation in [\eqref=EqtLagAct5] gives rise to the charge continuity equation [formula] which, thanks to [\eqref=MaxwellProca], is equivalent to the Lorentz condition [formula].

We assume in what follows that u(x,t)  =  u(x) does not depend on t, S(x,t)  =  ωt does not depend on x, and φ(x,t)  =  φ(x), A(x,t)  =  A(x) do not depend on t. In other words, we look for standing waves solutions of [\eqref=EqtLagAct5] and assume that we are in the static case of the system where (φ,A) depends on the sole spatial variable. By the fourth equation in [\eqref=EqtLagAct5] we then get that

[formula]

This clearly implies that, and is equivalent to, [formula] since

[formula]

As a remark, assuming that [formula], the Lorentz condition for the external Proca field (φ,A) would make φ dependent on the sole spatial variables. As for the second equation in [\eqref=EqtLagAct5] it reduces to [formula]. It is automatically satisfied when S(t)  =  ωt, and we are thus left with the first and third equations in [\eqref=EqtLagAct5]. Letting S  =    -  ωt, and φ  =  ωv, these equations are rewritten as

[formula]

In particular, letting φ  =  ωv, in [\eqref=EqtLagAct11], we recover our original system [\eqref=SWSyst]. In other words, our original system [\eqref=SWSyst] corresponds to looking for standing waves solutions of the Klein-Gordon-Maxwell-Proca system [\eqref=EqtLagAct5] in static form.

Existence Theory

We prove the existence part in Theorems [\ref=Thm1] and [\ref=Thm2] and look for solutions with a special variational structure. Formally, solutions of [\eqref=SWSyst] are critical points of the functional S defined by

[formula]

The functional S is strongly indefinite because of the competition between u and v. Following a very nice idea going back to Benci-Fortunato [\cite=BenFor0], we introduce the auxiliary functional Φ given by

[formula]

and then consider that u in [\eqref=SWSyst] can be seen as a critical point of

[formula]

where u+  =   max (u,0). We explicitly define MPT solutions to be solutions we obtain from Ip by the mountain pass lemma from 0 to u1 with ||u1||pLp being as large as we want with respect to ||u1||2H1. Let [formula] be defined by

[formula]

The following lemma establishes the existence and differentiability of Φ, as well as the C1-smoothness of Ψ. Equation [\eqref=DefPhi] is critical when n  =  4 because of the term u2Φ(u).

Let (M,g) be a smooth compact Riemannian 4-manifold and q  >  0. There exists Φ:H1(M)  →  H1(M) such that [\eqref=DefPhi] holds true and [formula] for all u∈H1(M). Moreover, Φ is locally Lipschitz and differentiable. Its differential DΦ(u)  =  Vu at u is given by

[formula]

for all φ∈H1(M). The functional [formula] defined in [\eqref=DefPsi] is C1 in H1(M) and

[formula]

for all u,φ∈H1(M).

We briefly sketch the proof. Let u∈H1 and [formula] be defined by

[formula]

The functional is well defined since H1  ⊂  L4. Letting Φ(0)  =  0 we can assume that [formula]. Let

[formula]

By standard minimization arguments there exists φ∈H1(M) such that [formula] and Hu(φ)  =  μ. In particular, μ  >  0. Letting [formula] we get that Φ(u) solves [\eqref=DefPhi] in H1. It is easily seen that Φ(u) is unique. By the maximum principle, Φ(u)  ≥  0. Noting that

[formula]

it also follows from the maximum principle that [formula]. Now we let u,v∈H1(M). We have that

[formula]

Multiplying the equation by Φ(v) - Φ(u), integrating over M, and by the Sobolev emedding theorem, we get that

[formula]

In particular, Φ is locally Lipschitz continuous. We can prove the existence of Vu(φ) in [\eqref=EqtDiffPhiLem1] as when proving the existence of Φ(u). Writing the equation satisfied by Φ(u + φ) - Φ(u) - Vu(φ), multiplying the equation by Φ(u + φ) - Φ(u) - Vu(φ) and integrating over M, we get that

[formula]

Then the differentiability of Φ follows from the continuity of Φ. In particular, Ψ is differentiable. By [\eqref=DefPhi],

[formula]

and we also have that [formula], where [formula]. Noting that

[formula]

we get that [\eqref=DiffPsi] holds true. The continuity of DΨ can be proved directly from [\eqref=DiffPsi] and the continuity of Φ. This ends the proof of the lemma.

Now we prove the subcritical existence of Theorem [\ref=Thm1]. We proceed by applying the mountain pass lemma to the functional Ip in [\eqref=DefFct].

By Lemma [\ref=Affine4Dim], Ip is C1 in H1. Let u0∈H1 such that [formula]. There holds Ip(0)  =  0 and Ip(tu0)  →    -    ∞   as t  →    +    ∞   since p  >  2. Since [formula] for all u, we also have that

[formula]

for all u∈H1, where C1,C2  >  0 do not depend on u. In particular, there exist δ,C  >  0 such that Ip(u)  ≥  C for all u∈H1 such that ||u||H1  =  δ. Let T0  =  T0(u0), T0  ≫  1, be such that Ip(T0u0)  <  0, and cp  =  cp(u0) be given by

[formula]

where P is the class of continuous paths joining 0 to T0u0. According to the above we can apply the mountain pass lemma and we get the existence of a sequence (uα)α in H1 such that Ip(uα)  →  cp and DIp(uα)  →  0 as α  →    +    ∞  . Writing that Ip(uα)  =  cp  +  o(1) and that DIp(uα).(uα)  =  o(||uα||H1), we get by Lemma [\ref=Affine4Dim] that

[formula]

for all α. Writing that DIp(uα).(u-α)  =  o(||u-α||H1) we get that u-α  →  0 in H1 as α  →    +    ∞  . By [\eqref=SubCritEqt1] we then get that (uα)α is bounded in H1. In particular, there exists up∈H1(M) such that, up to passing to a subsequence,

(i) [formula] weakly in H1,

(ii) uα  →  up in Lp,

and uα  →  up a.e. as α  →    +    ∞  . Substracting one equation to another in [\eqref=SubCritEqt1], letting α  →    +    ∞  , and since [formula], we get that [formula]. Writing the equation satisfied by Φ(uα) - Φ(up), multiplying the equation by Φ(uα) - Φ(up) and integrating over M, we get that

[formula]

as α  →    +    ∞  . Now we let φ∈H1. There holds DIp(uα).(φ)  =  o(1). Hence, by Lemma [\ref=Affine4Dim],

[formula]

Letting α  →    +    ∞   in [\eqref=SubCritEqt5] we then get by [\eqref=ConvStepSubCase] that

[formula]

in H1. Multiplying the equation by u-p and integrating over M, it follows that [formula]. In particular, up  ≥  0, [formula], and

[formula]

in H1. By regularity results we get from [\eqref=SubCritEqt7] that up∈H2,s for all s. Then, by regularity results, Φ(up)∈H2,s for all s. By the Sobolev embedding theorem, regularity theory, and the maximum principle, it follows that up,Φ(up)∈C2(M) and that up,Φ(up)  >  0 in M. Letting u  =  up and v  =  Φ(up), this proves the existence part in Theorem [\ref=Thm1].

An additional information we obtain is that up realizes cp. Indeed, since up  ≥  0, u-α  →  0 in H1, and Φ(uα)  →  Φ(up) in H1, there holds that

[formula]

as α  →    +    ∞  . The second equation in [\eqref=SubCritEqt1] together with [\eqref=SubCritEqt7] then give that

[formula]

It follows that uα  →  up in H1 as α  →    +    ∞  . By the first equation in [\eqref=SubCritEqt1] we then get that Ip(up)  =  cp. In other words, cp is realized by up. Now, given x0∈M and ρ0  >  0 small, sufficiently small, we define uε by

[formula]

where r  =  dg(x0,x). Then, see Aubin [\cite=Aub], for any [formula],

[formula]

where

[formula]

and C  >  0 is independent of α. Also there holds

[formula]

In what follows we prove the existence part of Theorem [\ref=Thm2].

As a preliminary remark, by standard arguments such as developed in Aubin [\cite=Aub] and Brézis and Nirenberg [\cite=BreNir], we just need to prove that we can chose u0∈H1, [formula], such that

[formula]

for all p∈(4 - ε,4) and some ε,δ0  >  0, where cp  =  cp(u0) is as in [\eqref=Defcp]. Now we assume that [\eqref=MainAssumpt] holds true for some x∈M, in particular for x∈M where Sg is maximum. We let x0∈M be such that Sg is maximum at x0, and (tε)ε be any family of positive real numbers such that the tε's are bounded. The first estimate we prove is that

[formula]

where the uε's are as in [\eqref=DefuEpsHighDim]. By definition,

[formula]

Multiplying [\eqref=EstDim4Eqt1] by Φ(tεuε) and integrating over M we get by Hölder's inequalities that

[formula]

and it follows from the Sobolev inequality that

[formula]

Then, by [\eqref=EstDim4Eqt2],

[formula]

There holds,

[formula]

By [\eqref=EstDim4Eqt3] and [\eqref=EstDim4Eqt4], this proves [\eqref=Dim4KeyEst]. Let (εα)α be a sequence of positive real numbers such that εα  →  0 as α  →    +    ∞  , uα  =  uεα, and F4 be the functional defined in H1 by

[formula]

By [\eqref=QuotSch2bis], there exists T0  ≫  1 such that I4(T0uα)  <  0 for all α  ≫  1. There also holds that

[formula]

for all α, where λ  =  m20  -  ω2. By [\eqref=TestComputaHighDim] and [\eqref=Dim4KeyEst] we thus get that

[formula]

where C  >  0 is independent of α. By assumption the ε2α ln εα coefficient is positive. Let u0  =  uα, where α  ≫  1 is sufficiently large such that

[formula]

for some δ0  >  0. Since u0 is now fixed, we can write that

[formula]

for all p∈(4 - ε,4), where δε > 0 is such that δε  →  0 as ε  →  0. Noting that

[formula]

where C1,C2  >  0 are independent of u, there holds that there exist δ1,δ2  >  0 such that δ1,δ2 are as small as we want, and Ip(u)  ≥  δ2 for all u such that ||u||H1  =  δ1. As a conclusion, there exist δ0  >  0 and ε  >  0 such that [\eqref=AubinTypeIneqt] holds true for all p∈(4 - ε,4). This ends the proof of the existence part in Theorem [\ref=Thm2].

There are always constant solutions to [\eqref=SWSyst]. By [\eqref=AubinTypeIneqt] the MPT solutions we obtain are distinct from these constant solutions in several situations, e.g. like on S1(T)  ×  S3 for [formula] when m21 / q  ≪  1.

A priori bounds in the subcritical case

We prove the uniform bounds in the subcritical case of Theorem [\ref=Thm1]. In what follows p∈(2,4).

Let (ωα)α be a sequence in ( - m0,m0) such that ωα  →  ω as α  →    +    ∞   for some ω∈[ -  m0,m0]. Also let p∈(2,4) and [formula] be a sequence of smooth positive solutions of [\eqref=SWSyst] with phases ωα. Then,

[formula]

for all α. By the second equation in [\eqref=SWSystAlpha], [formula] for all α. Assume by contradiction that

[formula]

as α  →    +    ∞  . Let xα∈M and μα  >  0 be given by

[formula]

By [\eqref=ContrAssumptSubCptness1], μα  →  0 as α  →    +    ∞  . Define ũα by

[formula]

and gα by [formula] for x∈B0(δμ- 1α), where δ  >  0 is small. Since μα  →  0, we get that gα  →  ξ in [formula] as α  →    +    ∞  . Moreover, by [\eqref=SWSystAlpha],

[formula]

where α is given by [formula]. We have ũα(0)  =  1 and 0  ≤  ũα  ≤  1. By [\eqref=EqtTildeUAlpha] and standard elliptic theory arguments, we can write that, after passing to a subsequence, ũα  →  u in [formula] as α  →    +    ∞  , where u is such that u(0)  =  1 and 0  ≤  u  ≤  1. Then

[formula]

in [formula], where Δ is the Euclidean Laplacian. It follows that u is actually smooth and positive, and, since 2  <  p  <  4, we get a contradiction with the Liouville result of Gidas and Spruck [\cite=GidSpr]. As a conclusion, [\eqref=ContrAssumptSubCptness1] is not possible and there exists C  >  0 such that

[formula]

in M for all α. Coming back to [\eqref=SWSystAlpha] it follows that the sequences (uα)α and (vα)α are actually bounded in H2,s for all s. Pushing one step further the regularity argument they turn out to be bounded in H3,s for all s, and by the Sobolev embedding theorem we get that they are also bounded in C2,θ, 0  <  θ  <  1. This ends the proof of the uniform bounds in Theorem [\ref=Thm1] when p∈(2,4).

If we assume that ωα  →  ω as α  →    +    ∞   for some ω∈( - m0,m0), p∈(2,4], and uα  →  u and vα  →  v in C2 as α  →    +    ∞  , then u  >  0, v  >  0, and u,v are smooth solutions of [\eqref=SWSyst]. Indeed, given ε  >  0 sufficiently small, since m20  -  ω2  >  0, Δg  +  (m20  -  ω2  -  ε) is coercive. There holds that [formula] for all α. In particular, by [\eqref=SWSystAlpha] and the Sobolev inequality, for any α  ≫  1 sufficiently large,

[formula]

for some C  >  0 independent of α. This implies u  >  0 and then v  >  0. Obviously the positivity of u and v does not hold anymore if we allow ω2  =  m20. Let (εα)α be a sequence of positive real numbers such that εα  →  0 as α  →    +    ∞  . Let uα  =  εα and

[formula]

Then uα  →  0 and vα  →  0 in C2 as α  →    +    ∞  , and we do have that (uα,vα) solves [\eqref=SWSystAlpha] , where

[formula]

In this case ω2α  →  m20 as α  →    +    ∞   and the construction provides a counter example to the above statement about the positivity of u and v.

A priori bounds in the critical case

In what follows we let (M,g) be a smooth compact 4-dimensional Riemannian manifold, m0,m1  >  0, and (ωα)α be a sequence in ( - m0,m0) such that ωα  →  ω as α  →    +    ∞   for some ω∈[ -  m0,m0]. Also we let [formula] be a sequence of smooth positive solutions of [\eqref=SWSyst] with phases ωα and p  =  4. Namely,

[formula]

for all α. By the second equation in [\eqref=SWSystAlphaCrit], [formula] for all α. In particular, if we let

[formula]

then ||hα||L∞  ≤  C for all α, where C  >  0 is independent of α. Assume by contradiction that

[formula]

as α  →    +    ∞  . In what follows we let (xα)α be a sequence of points in M, and (ρα)α be a sequence of positive real numbers, 0  <  ρα  <  ig / 7 for all α, where ig is the injectivity radius of (M,g). We assume that the xα's and ρα's satisfy

[formula]

We let μα be given by

[formula]

Since the hα's in [\eqref=Defhalpha] are L∞-bounded we can apply the asymptotic analysis in Druet and Hebey [\cite=DruHeb0] and Druet, Hebey and Vétois [\cite=DruHebVet]. In particular, we get that [formula] as α  →    +    ∞   and that

[formula]

in [formula] as α  →    +    ∞  , where μα is as in [\eqref=DefMualpha]. As a consequence, μα  →  0 as α  →    +    ∞  . Now we define [formula] by

[formula]

where [formula] is the volume of the sphere of center xα and radius r for the induced metric. Let [formula]. We define [formula] by

[formula]

It follows from [\eqref=Limualpha] that

[formula]

as α  →    +    ∞  , while the definition of rα gives that

[formula]

and that

[formula]

Let Bα be defined in M by

[formula]

where μα is as in [\eqref=DefMualpha]. The following sharp estimates, see Druet, Hebey and Robert [\cite=DruHebRob] and Druet, Hebey and Vétois [\cite=DruHebVet], hold true.

Let (M,g) be a smooth compact Riemannian 4-dimensional manifold, and [formula] be a sequence of smooth positive solutions of [\eqref=SWSystAlphaCrit] such that [\eqref=ContrAssumptSubCptness] holds true. Let (xα)α and (ρα)α be such that [\eqref=hypCdts] hold true, and let R  ≥  6 be such that Rrα  ≤  6ρα for all α  ≫  1. There exists C  >  0 such that, after passing to a subsequence,

[formula]

for all [formula] and all α, where μα is as in [\eqref=DefMualpha], and where rα is as in [\eqref=eq3.3]. In addition, there also exist C  >  0 and (εα)α such that

[formula]

in [formula] for all α, where εα  →  0 as α  →    +    ∞   and Sα(x)  =  dg(xα,x)- 1 for [formula].

Lemma [\ref=SharpEst] provide a sharp control on the uα's, but we need more to conclude. We prove that the following fundamental asymptotic estimate holds true. Lemma [\ref=LemSharpAsypts] is the key estimate we need to prove the a priori bounds in the critical case discussed in this section.

Let (M,g) be a smooth compact Riemannian 4-dimensional manifold and [formula] be a sequence of smooth positive solutions of [\eqref=SWSystAlphaCrit] such that [\eqref=ContrAssumptSubCptness] holds true. Let (xα)α and (ρα)α be such that [\eqref=hypCdts] holds true. Assume [\eqref=MainAssumpt]. There holds that rα  →  0 as α  →    +    ∞  , where rα is as in [\eqref=eq3.3]. Moreover [formula] and

[formula]

in [formula] as α  →    +    ∞  , where μα is as in [\eqref=DefMualpha], and H is a harmonic function in B0(2) which satisfies that H(0)  ≤  0.

Let R  ≥  6 be such that Rrα  ≤  6ρα for α  ≫  1. We assume first that rα  →  0 as α  →    +    ∞  . For x∈B0(3) we define

[formula]

where hα is as in [\eqref=Defhalpha]. Since rα  →  0 as α  →    +    ∞  , we have that α  →  ξ in [formula] as α  →    +    ∞  , where ξ is the Euclidean metric. Thanks to Lemma [\ref=SharpEst],

[formula]

in [formula]. By [\eqref=SWSystAlphaCrit],

[formula]

in [formula]. Thanks to [\eqref=eq3.4] and by standard elliptic theory, we then deduce that, after passing to a subsequence,

[formula]

in [formula] as α  →    +    ∞  , where W satisfies Δũ  =  0 in [formula] and Δ is the Euclidean Laplace Beltrami operator. Moreover, thanks to [\eqref=eq5.1], we know that

[formula]

in [formula]. Thus we can write that

[formula]

where Λ  ≥  0 and H satisfies ΔH = 0 in [formula]. In order to see that Λ  =  8, it is sufficient to integrate [\eqref=eq5.2] in B0(1) to get that

[formula]

By [\eqref=eq5.1],

[formula]

and by changing x into [formula], we can write that

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula]. By [\eqref=Limualpha] and Lemma [\ref=SharpEst], we then get that

[formula]

Noting that by [\eqref=eq5.3] and [\eqref=eq5.6],

[formula]

we get that Λ  =  8 thanks to [\eqref=Eqt2LS]-[\eqref=Eqt4LS] by passing into the limit in [\eqref=Eqt1LS] as α  →    +    ∞  . At this point we claim that there exists β∈(0,1] and C  >  0 such that

[formula]

for all α. Let xα∈M be a point where [formula] is maximum. Then,

[formula]

and it follows from [\eqref=SWSystAlphaCrit] that

[formula]

Choosing β∈(0,1] such that m21  -  βm20  >  0, since [formula], we get that uβα(xα)  ≥  Cvα(xα) for some C  >  0 independent of α. This proves [\eqref=FundIneqProofAsy]. In what follows we let Xα be the 1-form given by

[formula]

where [formula], [formula] is the Ricci curvature of g, and [formula] is the musical isomorphism. We apply the Pohozaev identity in Druet-Hebey [\cite=DruHeb1] with the vector field Xα to uα in Bxα(rα). We separate the regular part Aα  =  m20  -  ω2α from the singular part in hα. Then, [formula] and we get that

[formula]

where

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

and ν is the unit outward normal derivative to Bxα(rα). We have that

[formula]

Following Druet, Hebey and Vétois [\cite=DruHebVet] we get from Lemma [\ref=SharpEst], [\eqref=eq5.7] and [\eqref=PropXAlpha] that

[formula]

where xα  →  x0 as α  →    +    ∞  . By Lemma [\ref=SharpEst] and [\eqref=PropXAlpha] there also holds that

[formula]

At this point we decompose vα into a quasi-harmonic part with nonzero Dirichlet boundary condition and a quasi-Poisson part with zero Dirichler boundary condition. More precisely, we write that

[formula]

in Bα  =  Bxα(r̂α), where [formula], and w1,α, w2,α are given by

[formula]

and if Wα  =  Δgvα  +  m21vα, by

[formula]

Let Gα be the Green's function of Δg  +  m21 in Bα with zero Dirichlet boundary condition on ∂Bα. By the maximum principle, considering the Green's function on a larger ball of radius ig, we obtain by comparison of the two Green's functions that there exists C  >  0 such that Gα(x,y)  ≤  Cdg(x,y)- 2 for all [formula] in Bα. Writing that

[formula]

it follows that

[formula]

By [\eqref=Limualpha] and Lemma [\ref=SharpEst] we can write that

[formula]

in Bα. Combining [\eqref=Est1W1Alpha] and [\eqref=EstTotUAlpha] we then get that

[formula]

Independently, by the maximum principle, the w1,α's satisfy that [formula]. Let [formula] and [formula]. There holds

[formula]

where [formula], and [formula]. At this point we claim that

[formula]

as α  →    +    ∞  . In order to prove [\eqref=ConvrAlpha] we proceed by contradiction and assume that rα  ≥  δ0  >  0 for all α  ≫  1. By Lemma [\ref=SharpEst] and [\eqref=FundIneqProofAsy],

[formula]

where C  >  0 is independent of α since we assumed rα  ≥  δ0  >  0. In particular, ||vα||L∞(∂Bα)  →  0 as α  →    +    ∞  . Then ||α||L∞(∂B)  →  0 as α  →    +    ∞  , and it follows from the maximum principle and [\eqref=W1AlphaEqtBis] that ||ŵ1,α||L∞(B)  →  0 as α  →    +    ∞  . In particular, ||w1,α||L∞(Bα)  →  0 as α  →    +    ∞  . By [\eqref=DecompVAlpha] and [\eqref=Est2W1Alpha], thanks to what we just obtained about the w1,α's, we get that ||vα||L∞(Bα)  →  0 as α  →    +    ∞  . Then, by Lemma [\ref=SharpEst] and [\eqref=PropXAlpha] we get that

[formula]

and by [\eqref=PohoCo1] and [\eqref=PohoCo2], we obtain a contradiction with [\eqref=MainAssumpt]. This proves [\eqref=ConvrAlpha]. By [\eqref=eq5.3], [\eqref=eq5.5] and [\eqref=eq5.6] we get with [\eqref=ConvrAlpha] that

[formula]

Now we distinguish the two cases:

(i) [formula] as α  →    +    ∞  , and

(ii) [formula] for all α.

In case (i), since vα  =  O(1), we get from Lemma [\ref=SharpEst] and [\eqref=PropXAlpha] that

[formula]

Since there also holds that [formula] it follows from [\eqref=PohoCo1], [\eqref=ComputQ1Alpha] and [\eqref=ConcludEqtLemFond1] that H(0)  =  0. Now we assume (ii). From (ii) we get that [formula] and by [\eqref=FundIneqProofAsy] we obtain that

[formula]

In particular, ||vα||L∞(∂Bα)  →  0 as α  →    +    ∞  . Then ||α||L∞(∂B)  →  0 as α  →    +    ∞  , and it follows from the maximum principle and [\eqref=W1AlphaEqtBis] that ||ŵ1,α||L∞(B)  →  0 as α  →    +    ∞  . In particular, ||w1,α||L∞(Bα)  →  0 as α  →    +    ∞   and we get with [\eqref=DecompVAlpha], Lemma [\ref=SharpEst], and [\eqref=PropXAlpha], that

[formula]

There holds,

[formula]

Let [formula] be such that η is smooth, 0  ≤  η  ≤  1, η  =  1 in B0(1), and η  =  0 in [formula]. We define

[formula]

so that ηα  =  1 in Bxα(rα) and ηα  =  0 in [formula]. By Hölder's inequalities,

[formula]

while by Lemma [\ref=SharpEst] and [\eqref=PropXAlpha] there holds that

[formula]

Multiplying [\eqref=PDEEqtW2Alpha] by η2αw2,α, and integrating over M, we get that

[formula]

By Hölder's and Sobolev inequalities, and by [\eqref=PohoCo6],

[formula]

and it follows from [\eqref=PohoCo7] and [\eqref=PohoCo8] that

[formula]

By [\eqref=Est2W1Alpha], since [formula], we get that

[formula]

and by [\eqref=eq3.4] it follows that

[formula]

Coming back to [\eqref=PohoCo9], it follows that

[formula]

By [\eqref=ConcludEqtBisLemFond1], [\eqref=PohoCo5] and [\eqref=PohoCo6], we then get with [\eqref=NormEstimate] that

[formula]

Coming back to [\eqref=PohoCo1] and [\eqref=ComputQ1Alpha] it follows that

[formula]

By [\eqref=FinalH0] we get that H(0)  ≤  0. At this point it remains to prove that [formula]. We prove that ρα  =  rα. If not the case, then rα  <  ρα and we get with [\eqref=eq3.6] that [formula], where

[formula]

Hence H(0)  =  8 and we get a contradiction with H(0)  ≤  0. In other words, ρα  =  rα for all α  ≫  1. This ends the proof of the lemma.

Thanks to Lemma [\ref=LemSharpAsypts] we can now prove the uniform bounds in Theorem [\ref=Thm2]. This is the subject of what follows.

Let (M,g) be a smooth compact Riemannian 4-dimensional manifold and [formula] be a sequence of smooth positive solutions of [\eqref=SWSystAlphaCrit] such that [\eqref=MainAssumpt] holds true. By Druet, Hebey and Vétois [\cite=DruHebVet] there exists C  >  0 such that for any α the following holds true: there exist [formula] and Nα critical points of uα, denoted by [formula], such that

[formula]

for all [formula], i  ≠  j, and

[formula]

for all x∈M and all α. We define

[formula]

If Nα = 1, we set [formula], where ig is the injectivity radius of (M,g). We claim that

[formula]

as α  →    +    ∞  . In order to prove this claim, we proceed by contradiction. Assuming on the contrary that dα  →  0 as α  →    +    ∞  , we see that Nα  ≥  2 for α large, and we can thus assume that the concentration points are ordered in such a way that

[formula]

We set, for x∈B0(δd- 1α), [formula] fixed,

[formula]

It is clear that ĝα  →  ξ in [formula] as α  →    +    ∞   since dα  →  0 as α  →    +    ∞  . Thanks to [\eqref=SWSystAlphaCrit] we have that

[formula]

in B0(δd- 1α), for all i. For any R > 0, we also let 1  ≤  NR,α  ≤  Nα be such that

[formula]

Such a NR,α does exist thanks to [\eqref=eqconcl3]. We also have that NR,α  ≥  2 for all R > 1 and that (NR,α)α is uniformly bounded for all R > 0 thanks to [\eqref=eqconcl1]. In the sequel, we set

[formula]

for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  Nα such that [formula]. Thanks to [\eqref=Eqt2Pr], for any R > 1, there exists CR > 0 such that

[formula]

By the Harnack inequality in Druet, Hebey and Vétois [\cite=DruHebVet], for any R > 1, there exists DR > 1 such that

[formula]

where

[formula]

Assume first that, for some R > 0, there exists 1  ≤  i  ≤  NR,α such that

[formula]

The two first equations in [\eqref=hypCdts] are satisfied by the sequences xα  =  xi,α and [formula]. Then it follows from [\eqref=Limualpha] that the last equation in [\eqref=hypCdts] cannot hold and thus that (ûα)α is uniformly bounded in [formula]. In particular, by standard elliptic theory, and thanks to [\eqref=eqconcl4], (ûα)α is uniformly bounded in [formula]. Since, by [\eqref=Eqt1Pr], we have that

[formula]

we get the existence of some δi > 0 such that

[formula]

in Bx̂i,α(δi). Assume now that, for some R > 0, there exists 1  ≤  i  ≤  NR,α such that

[formula]

as α  →    +    ∞  . Since [\eqref=hypCdts] is satisfied by the sequences xα  =  xi,α and [formula], it follows from Lemma [\ref=LemSharpAsypts] that the sequence (|ûα(x̂i,α)|  ×  |ûα|)α is uniformly bounded in

[formula]

for some i  >  0. Thus, using ([\ref=eqconcl6]), we can deduce that these two situations are mutually exclusive in the sense that either [\eqref=AddedEqtAss1] holds true for all i or [\eqref=AddedEqtAss2] holds true for all i. Now we split the conclusion of the proof into two cases.

In the first case we assume that there exist R > 0 and 1  ≤  i  ≤  NR,α such that ûα(x̂i,α)  =  O(1). Then, thanks to the above discussion, we get that ûα(x̂j,α)  =  O(1) for all 1  ≤  j  ≤  NR,α and all R > 0. As above, we get that (ûα)α is uniformly bounded in [formula]. Thus, by standard elliptic theory, there exists a subsequence of (ûα)α which converges in [formula] to some û solution of Δû  =  û3 in [formula]. By the above discussion, |u| possesses at least two critical points, namely 0 and x̂2, the limit of x̂2,α. This is absurd thanks to the classification of Caffarelli, Gidas and Spruck [\cite=CafGidSpr].

In the second case we assume that there exist R  >  0 and 1  ≤  i  ≤  NR,α such that |ûα(x̂i,α)|  →    +    ∞   as α  →    +    ∞  . Then, thanks to the above discussion, ûα(x̂j,α)  →    +    ∞   as α  →    +    ∞  , for all 1  ≤  j  ≤  NR,α and all R > 0. By [\eqref=eqconcl4] we have that

[formula]

where α  =  ûα(0)ûα. Applying Lemma [\ref=LemSharpAsypts] and standard elliptic theory, and thanks to [\eqref=eqconcl6] and to the above discussion, one easily checks that, after passing to a subsequence, ûα(0)ûα  →  Ĝ in [formula] as α  →    +    ∞  , where [formula] and, for any R > 0,

[formula]

in B0(R), where 2  ≤  ÑR  ≤  N2R is such that |x̂ÑR|  ≤  R and |x̂ÑR + 1|  >  R, where N2R,α  →  N2R as α  →    +    ∞  , where λi  >  0, and where ĤR is a harmonic function in B0(R). Since Ĝ  ≥  0, we can write thanks to the maximum principle that, in a neighbourhood of the origin,

[formula]

where Ĥ(0)  ≥  Λ2  -  Λ1R- 2  -  Λ2(R - 1)- 2. Choosing R large enough, we can ensure that Ĥ(0) > 0 and this is in contradiction with Lemma [\ref=LemSharpAsypts].

By the above discussion we get that [\eqref=eqconcl2] holds true. Clearly, this implies that (Nα)α is uniformly bounded. Let (xα)α be a sequence of maximal points of uα. Thanks to [\eqref=ContrAssumptSubCptness] and to [\eqref=eqconcl2], we clearly have that [\eqref=hypCdts] holds true for the sequences (xα)α and ρα  =  δ for some δ > 0 fixed. This clearly contradicts Lemma [\ref=LemSharpAsypts] and thus concludes the proof of the uniform bounds in Theorem [\ref=Thm2].

Existence and nonexistence of a priori estimates for critical elliptic Schrödinger type equations on manifolds have been investigated by Berti-Malchiodi [\cite=BerMal], Brendle [\cite=Bre] [\cite=BreSur], Brendle and Marques [\cite=BreMar], Brézis and Li [\cite=BreLi], Druet [\cite=Dru1] [\cite=Dru2], Druet and Hebey [\cite=DruHebIMRS] [\cite=DruHeb0] [\cite=DruHeb1], Druet, Hebey, and Vétois [\cite=DruHebVet], Druet and Laurain [\cite=DruLau], Hebey [\cite=Heb1] [\cite=Heb2], Khuri, Marques and Schoen [\cite=KhuMarSch], Li and Zhang [\cite=LiZha] [\cite=LiZha2], Li and Zhu [\cite=LiZhu], Marques [\cite=Mar], Micheletti, Pistoia and Vétois [\cite=MicPisVet], Schoen [\cite=Sch3] [\cite=Sch4], and Vétois [\cite=Vet]. In the subcritical case, a priori estimates for Schrödinger equations go back to the seminal work by Gidas and Spruck [\cite=GidSpr]. The above list is not exhaustive.
