The rationality of the moduli spaces of trigonal curves of odd genus

Introduction

The object of this article is to prove the following.

The moduli space Tg of trigonal curves of genus g = 2n + 1 with [formula] is rational.

By a trigonal curve we mean an irreducible smooth projective curve which admits a degree 3 morphism to [formula]. A trigonal curve of genus [formula] has a unique g13, so that the space Tg to be studied is regarded as a sublocus of Mg, the moduli space of curves of genus g. Shepherd-Barron [\cite=SB] proved the rationality of Tg for g = 4n + 2 with [formula]. Hence the space Tg is rational possibly except when the genus g is divisible by 4. For the one lower gonality, Katsylo and Bogomolov [\cite=Ka1], [\cite=B-K] established the rationality of the moduli spaces of hyperelliptic curves.

The proof of Theorem [\ref=main] is based on the classical relation between trigonal curves and the Hirzebruch surfaces [formula]. Recall that a canonically embedded trigonal curve [formula] of genus [formula] lies on a unique rational normal scroll S. The scroll S may obtained either as the intersection of quadrics containing C, or as the scroll swept out by the lines spanned by the fibers of the trigonal map. The surface S is the image of a Hirzebruch surface [formula] by a linear system [formula], a > 0, where [formula] is the natural projection. The trigonal map of C is the restriction of π. When C is general in the moduli Tg, we have N = 0 or 1 depending on whether g is even or odd. Thus, if L3,b denotes the line bundle [formula] on [formula] with g = 2b + 1, we have the birational equivalence

[formula]

Here [formula] stands for a rational quotient of the linear system |L3,b| by the algebraic group [formula]. Then Theorem [\ref=main] is equivalent to the following assertion in invariant theory.

For the line bundle L3,b on the Hirzebruch surface [formula] the quotient [formula] is rational for [formula].

The rest of this article is devoted to the proof of this theorem. In Section [\ref=sec:_symmetric_product] we construct an [formula]-equivariant map from |L3,b| to [formula], the symmetric product of [formula], which plays crucial role in the proof. In Section [\ref=sec:_g>7] the rationality for [formula] is established by using the rational normal curves. In Section [\ref=sec:_g<9] the rationality of T7 and T5 is proved,

Throughout this article we work over the field of complex numbers. We denote by [formula] the natural projection. The ( - 1)-curve on [formula] is denoted by Σ. The line bundle [formula] on [formula] will be written as La,b. The bundle Oπ(1) is the pullback of [formula] by the blow-down [formula].

Symmetric product of the Hirzebruch surface

Let [formula] be the projective space bundle [formula] on [formula]. The variety [formula] parametrizes unordered pairs q+ + q- of two points of [formula] which lie on the same π-fiber. We have a rational map

[formula]

defined as follows. If [formula] and Fi is the π-fiber passing pi, we set qi + + qi - = C|Fi - pi. The map φ1 is clearly [formula]-equivariant. Next we define a rational map

[formula]

as follows. If Fi is the π-fiber passing {qi +,qi -} and [formula], there exists a unique involution ιi of [formula] which fixes pi and interchanges qi + and qi -. Then we let qi∈Fi be the fixed point of ιi other than pi. By the uniqueness of ιi the map φ2 is [formula]-equivariant. We study the composition map

[formula]

The map φ is dominant with a general fiber being an open set of a linear subspace of |L3,b|.

For a general point [formula] let Fi be the π-fiber passing qi and let [formula]. We take an inhomogeneous coordinate xi of [formula] in which pi is {xi = 0} and qi is {xi  =    ∞  }. The involution of Fi fixing pi and qi is given by xi  ↦   - xi. A smooth curve C∈|L3,b| is contained in [formula] if and only if C|Fi has the equation xi(αix2i  +  βi) = 0 for each [formula]. Since these are 2b linear conditions on |L3,b|, namely the vanishing of the coefficient of x2i and the constant term for C|Fi, the second assertion is proved. The dominancy of φ is a consequence of the dimension counting dim |L3,b| = 4b + 9 > 2b.

The group [formula] acts on [formula] almost freely if [formula].

First we treat the case [formula]. If a general point [formula] is fixed by a [formula], then g stabilizes a general [formula] point set of the ( - 1)-curve Σ so that g acts trivially on Σ. Hence g fixes each pi. As [formula] acts almost freely on [formula], it follows that g = id.

Next we study the case b = 4. Let [formula] be the blow-down. For a general [formula] there exists a unique smooth conic Q passing f(Σ) and [formula]. Any [formula] fixing [formula], regarded as an element of PGL3, preserves Q and the five point set [formula] on it. Hence g acts trivially on Q, which implies that g = id.

We shall apply the no-name lemma (see [\cite=Do], and also [\cite=C-G-R] for non-reductive groups) to the map φ when [formula]. For that we note the following.

Every line bundle on [formula] admits an [formula]-linearization.

We have canonical [formula]-linearizations on the bundles [formula], [formula], and [formula] where [formula] is the blow-down of Σ. These induce [formula]-linearizations on L1,0 and L0,1. Since [formula] is freely generated by L1,0 and L0,1, the lemma is proved.

By Lemma [\ref=linearization] the [formula]-action on |L3,b| is induced by an [formula]-representation on H0(L3,b). Then Lemma [\ref=lemma_2.1] shows that |L3,b| is [formula]-birational to the projectivization of an [formula]-linearized vector bundle on an open set of [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lemma_2.2] we may apply the no-name lemma to see the

For [formula] we have a birational equivalence

[formula]

Thus the rationality of [formula] for [formula] is reduced to a stable rationality of [formula].

Projection of rational normal curve

In this section we prove a stable rationality of the quotient [formula] to derive Theorem [\ref=main'] for [formula]. For an integer [formula] we consider the universal curve f:Hd  →  |L1,d| over the linear system |L1,d|. The variety Hd is defined as a divisor on [formula], and f is the restriction of the second projection [formula]. The bundle L0,1 on [formula] induces a relative hyperplane bundle for f which we denote by Of(1). Let

[formula]

An open set of Hd,b parametrizes pairs [formula] where H∈|L1,d| is smooth and [formula] are b points on H. Note that a smooth H∈|L1,d| is a section of π.

For [formula] we have a birational equivalence

[formula]

Consider the evaluation map

[formula]

The fiber [formula] over a general [formula] is an open set of the sub linear system of |L1,d| of curves passing [formula]. Since dim |L1,d| = 2d + 2  ≥  b, [formula] is non-empty and of dimension 2d + 2 - b. In particular, ψ is dominant. Then we may apply the no-name lemma for ψ as like the proof of Proposition [\ref=prop_2.4] to deduce the equivalence [\eqref=eqn_3.1].

By a comparison of Proposition [\ref=prop_2.4] and Lemma [\ref=lemma_3.1], it suffices for the proof of Theorem [\ref=main'] for [formula] to show the rationality of [formula] for one d in the range b  ≤  2d + 2  ≤  3b + 9. We begin with the

For [formula] we have a birational equivalence

[formula]

This lemma is an application of the no-name method for the fibration Hd,b  →  |L1,d|. Since the bundle L0,1 on [formula] admits an [formula]-linearization, so is the bundle Of(1) on the universal curve Hd. Hence the sheaf [formula] on |L1,d| is [formula]-linearized. It remains to check the almost freeness of the [formula]-action on |L1,d| for [formula]. For a general H∈|L1,d| the intersection [formula] is a general d point set of [formula]. If a [formula] stabilizes H, then we have [formula] so that g acts trivially on H. This is enough for concluding that g = id.

Blowing-down [formula] to [formula], we see that the quotient [formula] is birational to the PGL3-quotient of the space Xd of rational plane curves of degree d + 1 having an ordinary d-fold point. Let [formula] be the space of morphisms [formula] such that [formula] and [formula]. We have

[formula]

Let [formula] and [formula] be the rational normal curve [formula] where φ0 is the embedding associated to [formula]. Recall that every morphism [formula] with [formula] is the composition of (1) the isomorphism [formula], (2) the projection [formula] from a (d - 2)-plane [formula] which is disjoint from Γd + 1, and (3) an isomorphism [formula]. The group PGL3 acts on [formula] by transformation of an isomorphism [formula]. Hence the quotient [formula] is naturally birational to the locus Yd in the Grassmannian [formula] consisting of (d - 2)-planes [formula] such that (i) [formula] and (ii) there exists a (d - 1)-plane [formula] containing [formula] with [formula] being a d point set. For such a [formula], the (d - 1)-plane [formula] is spanned by the point set [formula] because of the fact that any distinct d points on a rational normal curve in [formula] are linearly independent. Also [formula] is uniquely determined by [formula] for an irreducible plane curve of degree d + 1 has at most one singularity of multiplicity d. These two facts imply that Yd is identified with an open set of the locus

[formula]

of pairs [formula] such that [formula] is a distinct d point set on [formula] and [formula] is a hyperplane of the (d - 1)-plane [formula]. We arrived at the birational equivalence

[formula]

Now we prove the

If [formula] is odd, the PGL2-quotient of Zd is rational. Hence [formula] is rational too.

The morphism

[formula]

is dominant with the fiber over a general [formula] being [formula]. The vector space [formula] is a subspace of [formula]. Since d + 1 is even, the bundle [formula] is PGL2-linearized so that the PGL2-action on [formula] is induced by a PGL2-representation on Vd + 1. Therefore Zd is PGL2-isomorphic to the projectivization of a PGL2-linearized vector bundle on an open set of [formula]. As PGL2 acts almost freely on [formula], the no-name method applied to the fibration [\eqref=eqn_3.5] shows that

[formula]

The quotient [formula] is rational by Katsylo [\cite=Ka1].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=main'] for [formula]. We may take an odd [formula] in the range b  ≤  2d + 2  ≤  3b + 9. By Proposition [\ref=prop_2.4], Lemma [\ref=lemma_3.1], and Lemma [\ref=lemma_3.2] we have

[formula]

Then [formula] is rational by Proposition [\ref=prop_3.3].

The case [formula]

The rationality of T7

We consider the [formula]-equivariant map [formula] defined in [\eqref=map_3]. The group [formula] acts almost transitively on [formula], with the stabilizer G of a general point q1 + q2 + q3 being isomorphic to [formula] by the permutation action on the set {q1,q2,q3}. As proved in Lemma [\ref=lemma_2.1], the fiber φ- 1(q1 + q2 + q3) is an open set of a sub linear system [formula]. Then by the slice method (see [\cite=Do]) we have the birational equivalence

[formula]

The G-action on [formula] is induced by a G-representation on V because the bundle L3,3 admits an [formula]-linearization. It is well-known that for any linear representation V' of [formula] the quotient [formula] is rational (apply the no-name method for the irreducible decomposition). Hence the quotient [formula] is rational, and Theorem [\ref=main'] is proved for b = 3.

The rationality of T5

We consider the [formula]-equivariant map [formula] defined in [\eqref=map_1].

The group [formula] acts almost transitively on [formula] with the stabilizer G of a general point [formula] being isomorphic to [formula].

Since [formula] and [formula] have the same dimention, it suffices to calculate the stabilizer G. If [formula] is the image of qi  ± by the blow-down [formula], the group G is identified with the group of those g∈PGL3 such that for each i = 1,2 we have g({pi +,pi -})  =  {pj +,pj -} for some [formula].

Let Fi be the π-fiber passing qi  ± and let [formula]. The fiber [formula] is an open set of the sub linear system [formula] of curves passing [formula] and p1,p2. Similarly as Section [\ref=ssec:_g=7], the slice method applied to the map φ1 implies that

[formula]

where the G-action on [formula] is induced by a G-representation on V. Let [formula] be the sub linear system defined by

[formula]

Since the group G preserves the curves F1 + F2 and Σ, the subspace [formula] is invariant under the G-action. Since G is finite, we have a G-decomposition [formula] where [formula] is a G-invariant subspace. The group G acts almost freely on the linear system |L1,0|. Hence we may apply the no-name lemma for the projection [formula] from [formula] to see that

[formula]

The quotient [formula], being of dimension 2, is rational by Castelnuovo's theorem. This completes the proof of rationality of T5.
