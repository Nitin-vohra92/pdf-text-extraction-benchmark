Introduction

Usually, infinite dimensional manifolds are defined to be paracompact spaces X modelled on some topological vector space E; E may be a Fréche space, a Banach space or a Hilbert space. More explicitly, X is a paracompact space covered by an atlas of open subsets {Uα} each of which is homeomorphic to an open set Eα of E by a given homeomorphism φα:Uα  →  Eα. The transitive functions between charts are assumed to be infinitely differentiable. The meaning of infinitely differentiable is too complicated to be given here; we refer the reader to [\cite=h] [\cite=m]for details. In this setting differential forms can be defined and de Rham's theorem holds under some mild conditions.

In this paper we propose a new treatment about infinite dimensional manifolds. Our treatment differs from the usual one in three respects. First, we adopt the language of categories and functors and our definition of infinite dimensional manifolds is a natural generalization of finite dimensional manifolds in the sense that de Rham cohomology and singular cohomology can be naturally defined and the basic properties (Functorial Property, Homotopy Invariant, Mayer-Vietoris Sequence) are preserved. Second, we need no topology except the topologies of finite dimensional manifolds. Thus we would not talk about the topology of an infinite dimensional manifold; instead we still have the homotopy type of an infinite dimensional manifold. Finally we can naturally define many classes of infinite dimensional manifolds including spaces of smooth mappings between finite dimensional manifolds, groups of diffeomorphisms of finite dimensional manifolds, spaces of connections on principal G-bundles and classifying spaces of Lie groups.

In we give the definition of infinite dimensional manifolds and several examples. is concerned with the cohomology theory of infinite dimensional manifolds. In we prove that de Rham's theorem holds for the classifying spaces of compact Lie groups. During the proof we get, as an unexpected byproduct, two simplicial set models for the classifying spaces of compact Lie groups; they are totally different from the classical models constructed by Milnor, Milgram, Segal and Steenrod (cf.[\cite=mi] [\cite=m1] [\cite=se] [\cite=st]). Throughout this paper, we assume that the reader is familiar with the elementary simplicial homotopy theory and category theory. The standard references are [\cite=c] [\cite=gj] [\cite=mac].

Definitions and Examples

Let [formula] be the subspace

[formula]

A function f on an open subset [formula] is smooth if and only if f can be extended to a C∞ function on an open subset of [formula]. A map g from an open subset [formula] to an open subset [formula] is smooth if [formula] is smooth for each coordinate function fi, 1  ≤  i  ≤  m.

A chart (with corners) on a topological space X is a homemorphism φ:U  →  Xα of an open subset U of [formula] with an open subset Xα of X. Two charts φ1, φ2 are said to be compatible if the functions φ- 12φ1 and φ- 11φ2 are smooth.

A smooth atlas (with corners) on a space X is an countable open cover {Xα} of X together with a collection of compatible charts φα:Uα  →  Xα. A smooth manifold with corners is a paracompact Hausdorff space X together with a maximal smooth atlas, i.e., a smooth structure.

As usual we can define smooth map and smooth homeomorphism between smooth manifolds with corner. We also have the concepts of closed submanifold and open submanifold, and the Whitney embedding theorem still holds in this setting; the proof is routine. From now on, we assume that all smooth manifolds are Hausdorff, paracompact and have a countable base.

Denote by [formula] the category of smooth manifolds with corner and smooth maps. For any category [formula], let [formula] be the class of objects of [formula]. We say that [formula] is a small category if [formula] forms a set.

There exists a subcategory [formula] of [formula] satisfying:

[formula] is a small category;

the inclusion functor [formula] is an equivalence of categories, i.e., i is full and for any object M in [formula], there is object N in [formula] such that i(N) is isomorphic to M;

[formula] belongs to [formula] for each [formula];

let N be a (closed or open) submanifold of [formula], then [formula];

[formula] is closed under finite product;

let [formula] be an infinite sequence of objects of [formula], and for each 0 < k <   ∞   let

[formula]

be an isomorphism of Mk onto a (closed or open) submanifold of [formula], satisfying [formula] for each j, k, then there is an [formula], including each Mk as a (closed or open) submanifold, and an isomorphism j:N'  →  N such that the composition [formula] is fk.

We want to choose, by transfinite induction, for each at most countable ordinal α a full subcategory [formula] of [formula] . First let [formula] be the full subcategory of closed submanifolds of [formula]. As each [formula] can be closely embedded in an [formula], we see that [formula] satisfies conditions (0), (1) and (2). Let β be a fixed at most countable ordinal. Suppose for all ordinals α with α  <  β, we have chosen [formula]; all of them are small categories. If β is a limit ordinal, set [formula]. If β is a successor ordinal, i.e., β  =  γ + 1 for some γ, we choose [formula] to be a full subcategory of [formula] (such a choice can always be done by adding some new objects) satisfying:

[formula] is a small category;

let N be a (closed or open) submanifold of [formula], then [formula];

for any [formula], [formula] belongs to [formula];

let [formula] be an infinite sequence of objects of [formula], and for each 0 < k <   ∞   let

[formula]

be an isomorphism of Mk onto a (closed or open) submanifold of [formula] satisfying [formula], then there exists an [formula], including each Mk as a (closed or open) submanifold, and an isomorphism j:N'  →  N such that the composition [formula] is fk.

Now set [formula] where α runs over all at most countable ordinals. It is easy to see from our construction that [formula] satisfies conditions (0)-(5).

Let p:P  →  M be a principal G-bundle in [formula], i.e., [formula] (from now on, all principal G-bundles are assumed to be in [formula]), and let f:N  →  M be an arrow in [formula]. Then the pullback of p:P  →  M along f is also a principal G-bundle in [formula]. Similar statement holds for vector bundles in [formula].

Let (Set) be the category of sets. A smooth functor is a contravariant functor

[formula]

A smooth functor F is called separated (resp. an infinite dimensional manifold) if it satisfies the following condition. Assume that [formula] is an open covering of X in [formula], and for each i there is an αi∈F(Vi) such that [formula] for each i,j, then there is at most (resp. exactly) one α∈F(X) such that α|Vi  =  αi.

Using the language of sheaf theory (cf. [\cite=ar] [\cite=mac1] [\cite=mi1]), a smooth functor is just a presheaf on the site of smooth manifolds, and a separated smooth functor (resp. an infinite dimensional manifold) is a separated presheaf (resp. a sheaf).

Let F, G be smooth functors, a smooth map from F to G is a natural transformation from F to G. Denote by [formula] the category of smooth functors and smooth maps, and denote by [formula] and [formula] the full subcategories of separated smooth functors and infinite dimensional manifolds respectively.

The inclusion functor [formula] has a left adjoint functor [formula], and the inclusion functor [formula] has a left adjoint functor [formula]

This lemma is standard in sheaf theory (cf.[\cite=mac1]), we give a proof for later use.

Given a smooth functor F, we construct ς(F) as follows. Let M be an object in [formula], we say that α,β∈F(M) are equivalent if there is an open covering [formula] of M such that α|Mi  =  β|Mi for each i. Define ς(F)(M) to be the equivalent classes of elements of F(M). It is clear that ς(F)(M) is functorial in M and ς(F) is a separated smooth functor.

Given a separated smooth functor G, we construct ς'(G) as follows. Let M be an object in [formula], a local datum of G on M consists of an open covering [formula] of M, and for each i an αi∈G(Mi), satisfying [formula] for any i, j. Two local data [formula] and [formula] of M on G are said to be equivalent if [formula] for any i, j. Define ς'(G)(M) to be the set of equivalent classes of local data of G on M. Then ς'(G)(M) is functorial in M and ς'(G) is an infinite dimensional manifold. One checks that ς and ς' are adjoint functors of i and i' respectively.

Let F be an infinite dimensional manifold, a submanifold of F is an infinite dimensional manifold G such that, for each M in [formula], G(M) is a subset of F(M).

Given two submanifolds G, H of an infinite dimensional manifold F, define [formula] in [formula] by [formula]. Set [formula], then [formula] is also a submanifold of F, called the union of G and H. The intersection of G and H is the submanifold [formula] defined by [formula]. The product of two infinite dimensional manifolds F, G is the infinite dimensional manifold F  ×  G defined by F  ×  G(M) = F(M)  ×  G(M).

To each M in [formula], we can associate a contravariant functor

[formula]

which sends N in [formula] to the set [formula]; if α:N  →  N' is an arrow in [formula], then hM(α) is defined by composition with α. It is clear that hM is an infinite dimensional manifold. An arrow f:M  →  N in [formula] yields a smooth map, i.e., a natural transformation hf:hM  →  hN. In this setting, the Yoneda Lemma states that,

Let M and N be objects in [formula], then the function

[formula]

that sends f:M  →  N to hf is bijective.

From now on we always identify each M in [formula] with the infinite dimensional manifold hM in [formula]. Thus [formula] is a full subcategory of [formula].

Given M, N in [formula], we can associate an infinite dimensional manifold C∞(M,N) by sending L in [formula] to [formula], if f:L  →  L' is an arrow in [formula], C∞(M,N)(f) is defined by composition with [formula].

For any M in [formula], define Diff(M) in [formula] by sending N in [formula] to the set

[formula]

For an arrow f:L  →  L' in [formula], Diff(M)(f) can be defined analogously.

Let ξ  =  {E  →  M} in [formula] be a vector bundle or a principal G-bundle, define Sec(ξ) in [formula] by sending each N in [formula] to the set of smooth sections of P*ξ  =  {P*E  →  M  ×  N} where P:M  ×  N  →  M is the projection. For each arrow f:N  →  N', Sec(ξ)(f) is defined by the pullback of sections along id  ×  f:M  ×  N  →  M  ×  N'.

Let G be a Lie group, define BG in [formula] by sending each M in [formula] to the set of principal G bundles on M with connection; for an arrow f:M  →  N in [formula], BG(f) is defined by the pullback of principal G bundles and connections along f. From the condition (5) in Theorem [\ref=main] we see that BG is indeed an infinite dimensional manifold. Our definition of BG is suggested by the existence of universal connection on the classifying space of Lie group (cf.[\cite=nr] [\cite=nr1]).

As pointed out by the referee, this example has an analogy in algebraic geometry, where the classifying space of an algebraic group G is defined as a stack which classifies G-torsors (cf.[\cite=lm]), but G-torsors are nothing but principal G-bundles in algebraic geometry.

Let ξ  =  {E  →  M} be a principal G-bundle, the space of connections on ξ is an infinite dimensional manifold Con(ξ) defined as follows. For each object N in [formula], Con(ξ)(N) is the set of connections on the principal G-bundle P*(ξ), where P:M  ×  N  →  M is the projection. For an arrow f:N  →  N' in [formula], Con(ξ)(f) is defined by the pullback of connections along id  ×  f:M  ×  N  →  M  ×  N'.

For each [formula], [formula] is defined by sending each M in [formula] to the set of differential n-forms on M; for each arrow f:M  →  N in [formula], An(f) is the induced map f*:An(N)  →  An(M). The exterior derivative induces a smooth map dn:An  →  An + 1, and the exterior product induces a smooth map [formula].

Cohomology Theory

Let F be a smooth functor, a differential n-form on F is a smooth map from F to An. Denote by An(F) the real vector space of differential n-forms on F, the smooth map dn:An  →  An + 1 induces a differential operator dn(F):An(F)  →  An + 1(F). The complex A*(F) together with the differential operators d*(F) is called the de Rham complex on F. Applying the smooth map [formula] we see that the A*(F) has the structure of a commutative differential graded algebra, the corresponding cohomology ring H*de(F) is called the de Rham cohomology of F.

Let F be a smooth functor, the singular complex S(F) is the simplicial set given by

[formula]

where

[formula]

is the geometric realization of the standard n-simplicial set [formula]. The singular cohomology ring H*si(F;R) of F with coefficient ring R is the cohomology ring H*(S(F);R); we can analogously define singular (co)chain complex and the homology (homotopy) groups of F.

Thus, although we have no topology for an infinite dimensional manifold, we can still talk about the homotopy type of it. In the following two propositions H*(F) will be H*de(F) or H*si(F;R).

(Functorial Property) Each smooth map f:F  →  G in [formula] induces a ring homomorphism f*:H*(G)  →  H*(F). If g:G  →  L is another smooth map in [formula], then (gf)* = f*g*.

Let [formula] be the unit interval

[formula]

=0.5cm H(G H; R) H(F; R) H(G; R) H(H; R) H(G H; R) H(F; R)

Classifying Spaces of Lie Groups

In this section we show that the de Rham theorem is valid for BG in [formula] where G is a compact Lie group in [formula].

Consider [formula] which sends each M in [formula] to the set of principal G-bundles on M. The map p':BG  →  BG' is defined by neglecting the connections.

The geometric realization |S(BG)| of the simplical set S(BG) is a classifying space of G.

We divide the proof into four lemmas.

S(BG') is a connected fibrant.

From condition (5) of Theorem [\ref=main], we see that S(BG') is a connected simplicial set. Thus it remains to show that given a commutative diagram in the category of simplicial set [formula] as follow (where [formula] is the standard n-simplicial set and Λnk is the k-th horn of [formula]):

[formula]

there is a map [formula] (the dotted arrow) making the diagram commute. Equivalently given a principal G-bundle on |Λnk| we want to extend it to a principal G-bundle on [formula]. As the inclusion [formula] is a homotopy equivalence, such an extension always exists by condition (5) of Theorem [\ref=main].

|S(BG')| is a classifying space of G.

Let [formula] (a CW complex) be a classifying space of G. For any finite subcomplex K of |S(BG')|, there is a canonical principal G-bundle ξK over K with projection EK  →  K (glue together principal G-bundles on all simplices), hence a classifying map [formula]. As {lK} are compatible (up to homotopy) under inclusions of finite subcomplexes of |S(BG')|, by the homotopy extension property of CW complexes (cf.[\cite=ha]), they induce a map [formula] such that the restriction of l to K is homotopic to lK for each finite subcomplex K. In order to prove this lemma, it suffices to show that l induces isomorphisms l* on homotopy groups.

First we prove that l* is surjective. Fix a faithful representation i:G  →  U(n) (for the existence of such a representation, see [\cite=bt], p.136), and consider the principal G-bundle δm with projection U(m + n) / U(m)  →  U(m + n) / (U(m)  ×  G) for each m. Choose a triangulation of U(m + n) / (U(m)  ×  G), then it induces a classifying map (by the definition of BG') k:U(m + n) / (U(m)  ×  G)  →  |S(BG')| such that the composition l  ·  k is the classifying map for δm. As U(m + n) / U(m) is 2m-connected, the classifying map l  ·  k induces isomorphism on πi for i < 2m (cf.[\cite=sw], p.202), hence l* is surjective on homotopy groups.

Now we prove that l* is injective. Let α∈πn(|S(BG')|) satisfying l*(α) = 0, we want to show that α = 0. As S(BG') is a fibrant, we can represent α by a simplicial map [formula] such that [formula] is the constant map [formula] (where *   is represented by the trivial G-bundle [formula]).

By the definition of BG', α is represented by a principle G-bundle ξ on [formula] satisfying [formula] is trivial, i.e. a principle G-bundle ξ on [formula]. Now l*(α) = 0 implies ξ is isomorphic to the trivial G-bundle

[formula]

Now condition (5) of Theorem [\ref=main] implies that there is a principal G-bundle δ over [formula] together with a trivialization of [formula], such that [formula] and [formula] is the trivial G-bundle. This yields a homotopy from α to the constant map, thus α = 0.

Let [formula] and [formula] Given a smooth function fi on Hi for each i, satisfying [formula], there always exists a smooth function f on [formula] such that f|Hi = fi.

Extend fn to a smooth function f'n on [formula] by

[formula]

If we can find a smooth function f'' satisfying f''|Hi = fi - f'n, then f'' + f'n is the desired f. Thus it suffices to prove this lemma when [formula]. Repeating this argument we see that it suffices to prove this lemma when fi = 0 for any i  ≤  n; in this case the lemma is trivial.

The induced simplicial map p:S(BG)  →  S(BG') is a fibration.

It suffices to prove that for every commutative diagram in [formula]

[formula]

there is a map [formula] (the dotted arrow) making the diagram commute.

By the definition of BG and BG', the above diagram gives a trivial principle G-bundle ξ on [formula] and for each i  ≠  k a connection wi on (di)*(ξ), satisfying wi = wj when restrict to intersection of two faces. To find a map [formula] making the diagram commute is equivalent to find a connection w on ξ such that when restricted to each (di)*(ξ) (i  ≠  k), w = wi. But in a trivial G-bundle, a connection is just a [formula]-value differential 1-form on the base space, where [formula] is the Lie algebra of G. By a linear coordinate transformation and Lemma [\ref=tt] we see that there always exists such a connection on ξ.

The fibre f- 1( * ) is contractible.

By Lemma 5.1. in [\cite=gj], it suffices to show that f- 1( * ) is connected and has an extra degeneracy. The the set of n-simplices of f- 1( * ) is the set of connections on the trivial principal G-bundle [formula], i.e., the set of [formula]-value differential 1-forms on [formula]. Thus there is only one 0-simplice in f- 1( * ). To each [formula]-value differential 1-form w on [formula] we assign a [formula]-value differential 1-form s- 1(w) on [formula] as follows.

Set

[formula]

and

[formula]

Then [formula]. Define a projection [formula] by

[formula]

and set

[formula]

One checks that s- 1(w) is a [formula]-value differential 1-form on [formula] and this assignment gives an extra degeneracy on f- 1( * ). Thus the proof is done.

Applying Lemma 4.3, Lemma 4.5, Lemma 4.6 and long exact sequence of homotopy groups in [\cite=gj] we see that p':S(BG)  →  S(BG') induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups, hence |S(BG)| is also a classifying space of G. This completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=de].

[formula] is an isomorphism. In other words, de Rham's theorem holds for BG.

By the definition of BG, the differential forms on BG are gauge natural differential forms. But Theorem 52.8 in [\cite=kms] states that all gauge natural differential forms are the classical Chern-Weil forms. Hence from Theorem 4.1 and the Chern-Weil theory (we refer the readers to [\cite=kn] for a detailed exposition about Chern-Weil theory) we see that

[formula]

is an isomorphism.

We see that S(BG) and S(BG') are two new (simplicial set) models for the classifying spaces of compact Lie groups; they are totally different from the classical models constructed by Milnor, Milgram, Segal and Steenrod [\cite=mi] [\cite=m1] [\cite=se] [\cite=st].
