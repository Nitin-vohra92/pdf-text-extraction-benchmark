Remark

Some completely monotonic functions involving the polygamma functions

Introduction

The digamma (or psi) function ψ(x) for x > 0 is defined to be the logarithmic derivative of Euler's gamma function The function ψ and its derivatives are called polygamma functions.

There are many interesting inequalities involving the polygamma functions in the literature, many of which are closely related to the fact that ψ' is completely monotonic on (0,  +    ∞  ). Here we recall that a function f(x) is said to be completely monotonic on (a,b) if it has derivatives of all orders and ( - 1)kf(k)(x)  ≥  0,x∈(a,b),k  ≥  0 and f(x) is said to be strictly completely monotonic on (a,b) if ( - 1)kf(k)(x)  >  0,x∈(a,b),k  ≥  0.

A general result of Fink [\cite=F] on completely monotonic functions implies that for integers n  ≥  2,

[formula]

The following inequality of the reverse direction is given in [\cite=T&W&W]:

[formula]

A short proof of the above inequality is given in [\cite=E&R].

For integers p  ≥  m  ≥  n  ≥  q  ≥  0 and any real number s, we define where we set ψ(0)(x) =  - 1 for convenience.

In [\cite=A&W], Alzer and Wells established a nice generalization of the above results. Their result asserts that for n  ≥  2, the function Fn + 1,n,n,n - 1(x;s) is strictly completely monotonic on (0,  +    ∞  ) if and only if s  ≤  (n - 1) / n and - Fn + 1,n,n,n - 1(x;s) is strictly completely monotonic on (0,  +    ∞  ) if and only if s  ≥  n / (n + 1).

We denote Note that 0 < αp,m,n,q,βp,m,n,q < 1 when p + q = m + n,p > m.

In [\cite=Gao1], the following generalization of the result of Alzer and Wells is given:

Let p > m  ≥  n > q  ≥  0 be integers satisfying m + n = p + q. The function Fp,m,n,q(x;αp,m,n,q) is completely monotonic on (0,  +    ∞  ). The function - Fp,m,n,q(x;βp,m,n,q) is also completely monotonic on (0,  +    ∞  ) when q > 0.

For a given function f(x), we denote for c > 0,

[formula]

We define for integers p  ≥  m  ≥  n  ≥  q  ≥  0, real number c > 0 and any real number s,

[formula]

where we set ψ(0)(x) = ψ(x),ψ( - 1)(x) =  - x for convenience. We further define Fp,m,n,q(x;s;0) =  lim c  →  0+Fp,m,n,q(x;s;c) and it is then easy to see that Fp,m,n,q(x;s;0) = Fp,m,n,q(x;s).

It's shown in [\cite=Q&G] that on ( -  min (s,t),  +    ∞  ), the function F2,1,1,0(x + s;1;t - s) (resp. its negative) is completely monotonic when |t - s| < 1 (resp. when |t - s| < 1) and it is further given in [\cite=Q&G2] a necessary and sufficient condition on λ,t,s for F2,1,1,0(x + s;λ;t - s) or it's negative to be completely monotonic on ( -  min (s,t),  +    ∞  ). We point out here that one can easily deduce these results on F2,1,1,0(x + s;λ;t - s) from similar results on F2,1,1,0(x;λ;t) by a change of variable.

Motivated by the above results, it is our goal in this paper to prove the following:

Let p > m  ≥  n > q  ≥  0 be integers satisfying m + n = p + q and let c > 0. Then

For 0 < c  ≤  1,

The function Fp,m,n,q(x;s;c) is completely monotonic on (0,  +    ∞  ) if and only if s  ≤  αp,m,n,q.

The function - Fm + n,m,n,0(x;s;c) is completely monotonic on (0,  +    ∞  ) if and only if s  ≥  αm + n,m,n,0 / c.

For c  ≥  1,

The function - Fp,m,n,q(x;s;c) is completely monotonic on (0,  +    ∞  ) if and only if s  ≥  αp,m,n,q.

The function Fm + n,m,n,0(x;s;c) is completely monotonic on (0,  +    ∞  ) if and only if s  ≤  αm + n,m,n,0 / c.

The function - Fp,m,n,q(x;βp,m,n,q;c) is completely monotonic on (0,  +    ∞  ) for all c > 0 when q  ≥  1 .

Lemmas

The first Lemma lists some facts about the polygamma functions. These can be found, for example, in [\cite=alz2]:

For x > 0,

[formula]

Let m > n  ≥  1 be two integers, then for any fixed constant 0 < c < 1, the function has exactly one root when t  ≥  1.

Let a,c > 0, then the function is decreasing on s∈(0,1) if 0 < c  ≤  1 and increasing on (0,1) if c  ≥  1.

For fixed c, it's easy to see that

[formula]

where

[formula]

It's also easy to see that v'c(x) = z(x,c) - z(x,1) where

[formula]

Now, we have

[formula]

where f(t) = (2 - t)et - (2 + t). It's then easy to see that f(t)  ≤  0 for t  ≥  0 and it follows that v'c(x)  ≥  0 when 0 < c  ≤  1 and that v'c(x)  ≤  0 when c  ≥  1. We then deduce that u'(s;a,c)  ≤  0 when 0 < c  ≤  1 and u'(s;a,c)  ≥  0 when c  ≥  1 and this completes the proof.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm1]

We first prove assertions (1) (a) and (2) (a) of the theorem. Note first that if Fp,m,n,q(x;s;c) is completely monotonic on (0,  +    ∞  ), then we have

[formula]

It then follows easily from the mean value theorem and [\eqref=1.2] that we have

[formula]

Thus, s  ≤  αp,m,n,q. Similarly, one shows that if - Fp,m,n,q(x;s;c) is completely monotonic on (0,  +    ∞  ), then s  ≥  αp,m,n,q and this proves the "only if" part of the assertions (1) (a) and (2) (a) of the theorem.

To prove the "if" part of the assertions (1) (a) and (2) (a) of the theorem, it's easy to see that it suffices to show that Fp,m,n,q(x;αp,m,n,q;c) is completely monotonic on (0,  +    ∞  ) when 0 < c  ≤  1 and that - Fp,m,n,q(x;αp,m,n,q;c) is completely monotonic on (0,  +    ∞  ) when c  ≥  1.

We first consider the function Fp,m,n,q(x;αp,m,n,q;c) with q  ≥  1 following the approach in [\cite=A&W]. Using the integral representations [\eqref=1.11] and [\eqref=1.10] for the polygamma functions and using *   for the Laplace convolution, we get where

[formula]

with

[formula]

By a change of variable s  →  ts we can recast g(t) as We now break the above integral into two integrals, one from 0 to 1 / 2 and the other from 1 / 2 to 1. We make a further change of variable s  →  (1 - s) / 2 for the first one and s  →  (1 + s) / 2 for the second one. We now combine them to get

[formula]

where the function a(t;m,n,c) is defined as in Lemma [\ref=lem5] and the function u(s;a,c) is defined as in Lemma [\ref=lem7]. Note that (1 + s) / (1 - s)  ≥  1 for 0  ≤  s < 1 and p - q > n - q  ≥  1, hence by Lemma [\ref=lem5], there is a unique number 0  <  s0  <  1 such that It follows from a(1;p - q,n - q,αp,m,n,q) > 0 and lim t  →    +    ∞a(t;p - q,n - q,αp,m,n,q) < 0 that for 0 < s  ≤  s0,

[formula]

with the above inequality being reversed when s0  ≤  s < 1.

We further note by Lemma [\ref=lem7], the function u(s;t / 2,c) is decreasing on s∈(0,1) when 0 < c  ≤  1 and increasing when c  ≥  1. Thus we conclude that when 0 < c  ≤  1,

[formula]

with the above inequality being reversed when c  ≥  1.

Hence when 0 < c  ≤  1,

[formula]

with the above inequality being reversed when c  ≥  1.

Note that the integral above is (by reversing the process above on changing variables) where the last step follows from the well-known beta function identity and the well-known fact Γ(n)  =  (n - 1)! for n  ≥  1. It follows that g(t)  ≥  0 when 0 < c  ≤  1 and g(t)  ≤  0 when c  ≥  1 and this completes the proof for the "if" part of the assertions (1) (a) and (2) (a) of Theorem [\ref=thm1] for Fp,m,n,q(x;αp,m,n,q;c) with q  ≥  1.

Now we consider the function Fp,m,n,q(x;αp,m,n,q;c) with q = 0. In this case p = m + n and we note that and we use this to write It follows that

[formula]

Now we note that, for hc(s) defined as in [\eqref=3.1],

[formula]

where vc(x) is defined as in [\eqref=2.3]. It follows from the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem7] that h'c(s) / hc(s)  ≤  0 when 0  <  c  ≤  1 and h'c(s) / hc(s)  ≥  0 when c  ≥  1. We then deduce that when 0 < c  ≤  1, for t  ≥  s  ≥  0 with the above inequality being reversed when c  ≥  1. This implies that the function t  ↦   ln hc(t - s) -  ln hc(t) is increasing (resp. decreasing) for t > s when 0 < c  ≤  1 (resp. when c  ≥  1). Thus we obtain that when 0 < c  ≤  1, with the above inequality being reversed when c  ≥  1. One checks easily that this implies that when 0 < c  ≤  1,

[formula]

with the above inequality being reversed when c  ≥  1. This implies the "if" part of the assertions (1) (a) and (2) (a) of the theorem for Fm + n,m,n,0(x;αm + n,m,n,0;c).

Now we prove the assertions (1) (b) and (2) (b) of the theorem. Note that if Fm + n,m,n,0(x;s;c) is completely monotonic on (0,  +    ∞  ), then we have

[formula]

It then follows from [\eqref=3.4] that we have

[formula]

Thus, s  ≤  αm + n,m,n,0 / c. Similarly, one shows that if - Fm + n,m,n,0(x;s;c) is completely monotonic on (0,  +    ∞  ), then s  ≥  αm + n,m,n,0 / c and this proves the "only if" part of the assertions (1) (b) and (2) (b) of the theorem.

To prove the "if" part of the assertions (1) (b) and (2) (b) of the theorem, it's easy to see that it suffices to show that - Fm + n,m,n,0(x;αm + n,m,n,0 / c;c) is completely monotonic on (0,  +    ∞  ) when 0 < c  ≤  1 and that Fm + n,m,n,0(x;αm + n,m,n,0 / c;c) is completely monotonic on (0,  +    ∞  ) when c  ≥  1.

Similarly to [\eqref=3.2], we have

[formula]

For fixed t > s > 0, define

[formula]

Then we have

[formula]

as it's easy to see that the function x  ↦  x / (ex - 1) is decreasing for x  >  0. It follows that the function rs,t(c) is an increasing function of c so that rs,t(c)  ≤  rs,t(1) when 0 < c  ≤  1 and rs,t(c)  ≥  rs,t(1) when c  ≥  1. One sees easily that the "if" part of the assertions (1) (b) and (2) (b) of the theorem follows from this.

Lastly, we prove assertion (3) of the theorem. This is similar to our proof above of the "if" part of the assertions (1) (a) and (2) (a) of the theorem for Fp,m,n,q(x;αp,m,n,q;c) with q  ≥  1, except that we replace αp,m,n,q by βp,m,n,q and recast the function gp,m,n,q(t;βp,m,n,q) similar to [\eqref=3.02] as

[formula]

It is then easy to show using the method in the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem7] that the function s  ↦  a- 2(1 - s2)- 1u(s;a,c) is increasing on s∈(0,1) when c > 0 and essentially repeating the rest of the proof of the "if" part of the assertions (1) (a) and (2) (a) of the theorem allows us to establish assertion (3) of the theorem.
