Neutrinoless double beta decay studied with configuration mixing methods

Double beta decay is a process where an even-even isotope decays into a nucleus with two less (more) neutrons (protons) with the emission of either two electrons and two neutrinos (2νββ) or only two electrons (0νββ). This process becomes the only decaying mode for those nuclei where the single beta decay to the odd-odd neighbor is energetically forbidden [\cite=Avignone.Elliott.Engel:2008]. While the first mode has been already observed for several nuclei with half-lives of ~  1019 - 21 y, there is only one controversial claim of detection of neutrinoless double beta decay [\cite=Klapdor-Kleingrothaus.Krivosheina.ea:2004]. This mode is very relevant because can only occur, beyond the standard model, if neutrinos are Majorana particles. Moreover, the inverse of the half-life of this process is directly related to the absolute mass of the neutrinos [\cite=Avignone.Elliott.Engel:2008]:

[formula]

where 〈mββ〉 is the effective Majorana neutrino mass, me is the electron mass, G01 is a kinematical space factor and finally, M0ν is the nuclear matrix element (NME). Due to the relevance of this process in particle and nuclear physics, there are several experiments devoted to search for 0νββ decay of different possible emitters [\cite=Ejiri:2010]. From the theoretical point of view, the most important quantity to determine is the NME. Several nuclear structure methods have been applied to compute 0νββ NME being the Interacting Shell Model (ISM) [\cite=Caurier.Menendez.ea:2008] [\cite=Menendez.Poves.ea:2009] and proton-neutron Quasiparticle Random Phase Approximation (QRPA) in different versions [\cite=Simkovic.Pantis.ea:1999] [\cite=Simkovic.Faessler.ea:2008] [\cite=Kortelainen.Suhonen:2007] [\cite=Suhonen.Civitarese:2010] the most used ones. Additionally, calculations performed with two other methods - angular momentum Projected Hartree Fock Bogoliubov (PHFB) with a pairing plus quadrupole schematic interaction [\cite=Chaturvedi.Chandra.ea:2008] [\cite=chandra:2009] and Interacting Boson Model (IBM) [\cite=Barea.Iachello:2009]- have been reported. Recently, we have proposed to study M0ν matrix elements with energy density functional methods including beyond mean field effects [\cite=arxiv]. In this contribution, we present the calculation of NME, total Gamow-Teller (GT) strengths S+ ( - ) and Ikeda sum rule within this framework. We also show results for most of the isotopes that are considered as best candidates for detecting 0νββ decay giving a detailed analysis for 48Ca, 76Ge and 150Nd of interest for CANDLES [\cite=CANDLES], GERDA [\cite=GERDA] and SNO+ [\cite=SNO+] experiments respectively.

Energy density functional (EDF) methods have been extensively applied for describing properly many properties along the whole nuclear chart (see Ref. [\cite=Bender.Heenen.Reinhard:2003] for a review). In this work we use an EDF based on the Gogny D1S interaction [\cite=Berger.Girod.Gogny:1984] where particle number and rotational symmetries are restored and shape mixing (axial quadrupole degree of freedom) is taken into account within the framework of the Generating Coordinate Method (GCM+PNAMP functional). Contrary to other methods, single particle energies and residual interactions come from the same functional self-consistently. We assume the closure approximation for calculating NME's because at present it is not possible to compute the intermediate odd-odd nucleus within this framework. Then, M0ν of Eq. [\ref=halflife] can be evaluated as [\cite=Avignone.Elliott.Engel:2008]:

[formula]

where |0+i / f〉 are the initial and final ground states, gV = 1,gA = 1.25 are the vector and axial vector coupling constants and F / GT / T are the Fermi, Gamow-Teller and Tensor two-body operators. In this work, tensor term is neglected [\cite=Menendez.Poves.ea:2009] [\cite=Kortelainen.Suhonen:2007] and F and GT operators can be written as:

[formula]

Here - is the isospin ladder operator that changes neutrons to protons, [formula] are the Pauli matrices acting on the spin part and [formula] are local potentials that depend on the relative coordinate of the nucleons involved in the decay, [formula]. The functions vF / GT(r) are the so-called neutrino potentials including high order currents [\cite=Simkovic.Pantis.ea:1999], nucleon finite size corrections [\cite=Simkovic.Pantis.ea:1999] and radial short range correlations treated within the Unitary Correlator Method [\cite=Feldmeier.Neff.ea:1998] [\cite=Kortelainen.Suhonen:2007] (see Ref. [\cite=Menendez.Poves.ea:2009] for further details). We now describe the method for calculating the ground states |0+i / f〉 and observables using these wave functions. For the sake of simplicity, we formulate the theoretical framework in terms of operators and wave functions although a derivation in terms of densities can be found in Refs. [\cite=Rodriguez.Egido.Robledo:2002] [\cite=lacroix.duguet.bender:2009]. The starting point is the GCM wave function:

[formula]

where [formula], [formula] are the corresponding angular momentum (I = 0) -for axial symmetric wave functions- and particle number projectors [\cite=Ring.Schuck:1980]. The intrinsic axial symmetric Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) wave functions |Φβ〉 are solutions to the variation after particle number projection equations constrained to a given value of the quadrupole deformation, β [\cite=Anguiano.Egido.Robledo:2001] [\cite=Rodriguez.Egido:2007]. These intrinsic wave functions are vacuum for the quasiparticle operators γ that are defined by the HFB transformation [\cite=Ring.Schuck:1980]:

[formula]

with U,V being the HFB variational coefficients and [formula] creation (annihilation) operators in the arbitrary single particle basis in which we expand the many body intrinsic wave functions. In our case, this basis corresponds to a spherical harmonic oscillator potential solved in cartesian coordinates that includes eleven major oscillator shells. Now, the coefficients gβ are found by solving the Hill-Wheeler-Griffin (HWG) equation [\cite=Ring.Schuck:1980] [\cite=Rodriguez.Egido.Robledo:2002] [\cite=lacroix.duguet.bender:2009]. First, for each nucleus we transform the non-orthogonal set of wave functions [formula] into an orthonormal one [formula] by diagonalizing the norm overlap matrix, [formula]. In this basis, the HWG equation reads: [formula], where εΛΛ' are the so-called energy kernel [\cite=Rodriguez.Egido:2007] [\cite=Rodriguez.Egido.Robledo:2002] [\cite=lacroix.duguet.bender:2009]. Finally, the coefficients for the lowest eigenvalue are used to compute both the so-called collective wave functions [formula] - probability distribution for the state to have a given deformation - and all observables. For scalar -under rotation- operators Ô, matrix elements between |0+i / f〉 states can be calculated with the expression:

[formula]

In this work we will focus our interest on calculating 0νββ NME's and also ground state energies, charge radii and total Gamow-Teller strengths S+  /  -. We will compare these quantities with the available experimental data to check the reliability of the method. In particular, the dependence on deformation of the 0νββ NME's is evaluated with the kernel of Eq. [\ref=observables] for the specific case of Ô  =  0νξ (ξ = F / GT):

[formula]

Finally, we evaluate the total GT strength calculating the matrix elements of the operator ±GT  =  +  /  - between the ground state |0+〉 of the even-even initial nucleus and the 1+m states in the odd-odd final nucleus:

[formula]

In the r.h.s of Eq. [\ref=gt] we have taken into account the completeness relation of the final states -[formula]- that leads to a two-body form of the corresponding operators:

[formula]

where [formula] are the matrix elements of the Pauli operators in the harmonic oscillator single particle basis and α ([formula]) annihilates (creates) a neutron (proton) in the orbit α (ζ). From the above expression we can also see that Ikeda's sum rule (S- - S+ = 3(N - Z)) is fulfilled if particle number conserving wave functions are considered.

Before evaluating the 0νββ NME's within the framework described above, we check the reliability of the method comparing theoretical and experimental results for masses, charge radii and total GT strengths. We observe a very nice agreement between the computed values and the experimental ones. For example, relative errors for masses and radii are less than 1.5% in all cases. It is important to note that total GT strengths S+  /  - have been quenched by a factor (0.74)2 as it is usually done in ISM [\cite=SM_RMP] and QRPA [\cite=Alvarez-Rodriguez.Sarriguren.ea:2004] calculations. We now study the dependence of the 0νββ NME's on deformation and pairing correlations of the isotopes involved in the process. In Figure [\ref=Figure1](d)-(f) we plot the magnitude of the GT contribution as a function of the quadrupole deformation of mother and granddaughter nuclei for A = 48, 76 and 150 decays (Eq. [\ref=m_Gt]) -Fermi contributions have a similar form and are not shown. We observe that the intensity is distributed rather symmetrically along the βi  =  βf direction having its larger values in regions close to the spherical points. This region is wider for the A = 48 case than for A = 76 and 150. Apart from this area, the NME is strongly suppressed whenever the difference in deformation of the two nuclei is large. This has been also noticed in ISM [\cite=Menendez.Poves.ea:2008] and PHFB calculations [\cite=Chaturvedi.Chandra.ea:2008] [\cite=chandra:2009] for 0νββ and QRPA calculations [\cite=Alvarez-Rodriguez.Sarriguren.ea:2004] for 2νββ. Nevertheless, we also obtain maxima and minima along the diagonal βi  =  βf finding a non-trivial structure. Concerning the magnitude of the GT NME's, we obtain less intensity in A = 48 than in the rest, having maximum values of 3.3, 5.7 and 5.8 for A = 48, 76 and 150 respectively. In order to shed light on this structure we represent in Fig. [\ref=Figure1](g)-(i) the results for a modified GT operator where all the involved spatial dependence of the neutrino potentials are substituted by constant potentials -VGT = VGT,0 =  - 1.5, - 2.3, - 2.2 for A = 48,76,150 respectively. With this assumption, GT 0νββ matrix elements reduce to the 2νββ ones evaluated in the closure approximation because [formula] (see Eq. [\ref=NME]). We observe that the structure as a function of the deformation is reproduced with this simplified operator indicating that [formula] matrix elements are almost proportional to [formula]. In addition, we can also relate the structure of the operator given in Fig. [\ref=Figure1](d)-(f) with the amount of pairing correlations in the mother and granddaughter nuclei separately (pairing energy - Epp [\cite=Ring.Schuck:1980]) represented in Fig. [\ref=Figure1](j)-(l). We can observe a direct correlation between maxima and minima found both in the pairing energy and in the intensity of the GT contribution. Furthermore, the value of the strength is bigger with larger pairing correlations, in agreement with ISM calculations where zero seniority calculations give the largest values of the NME's [\cite=Caurier.Menendez.ea:2008].

Finally, we have to take into account the effect of configuration mixing in the calculations. In Fig. [\ref=Figure1](a)-(c) we show the collective wave functions for initial and final states of A = 48,76,150 decays respectively. Here, we observe for 48Ca a rather constant distribution of probability between β  ≈  [ -  0.2,  +  0.2] with the maximum at the spherical point; for 48Ti we find two maxima in β  ≈   - 0.2 and β  ≈   + 0.3 and a minimum in β = 0 giving in average a very slightly prolate deformed state; this is also found for 76Ge with maxima at [formula] while 76Se is mostly oblate deformed with a peak at β  ≈   - 0.25. Finally, both 150Nd and 150Sm are well prolate deformed but their wave functions peak at different deformations (β  ≈   + 0.40 and β  ≈   + 0.25, respectively). According to Eq. [\ref=observables], the final results depend on the convolution of the collective wave functions with the 0νββ matrix elements as a function of deformation. In Fig. [\ref=Figure1](d)-(f) we show schematically -shaded circles- the areas of the GT intensity explored by the collective wave functions. We observe, on the one hand, that configuration mixing is very important in the final result because several shapes can contribute to the value of NME, especially in A = 48 and 76. On the other hand, we see that the regions with largest values of the GT intensity are excluded by the collective wave functions. For example, calculations assuming spherical symmetry give systematically larger NME -except for A = 96- as we show in Figure [\ref=Figure2].

To summarize, we have presented a method for calculating 0νββ nuclear matrix elements based on Gogny D1S Energy Density Functional including beyond mean field effects such as symmetry restoration and shape mixing. We have validated our method comparing theoretical and experimental ground state properties. Then, we have studied in detail the dependence on deformation of NME in A = 48,76,150 decays relating the structure obtained with the pairing correlations in the mother and granddaughter nuclei. We have also found a close connection between the strength of the NME's and the results obtained assuming a constant dependence in the spatial part of the transition operators. Finally, we have pointed out the relevance of having configuration mixing in the calculations.
