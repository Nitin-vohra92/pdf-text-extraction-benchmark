Keywords: relativistic wave equations, exact solutions, bound states

Introduction

Exact solutions of quantum field equations of motion provide an effective tool in studies of different phenomena of particle interactions in high energy physics. They supply with particular applications in solving problems of charged particles motion in electromagnetic fields of terrestrial experimental devices, as well as in astrophysics and cosmology. Exact solutions were first applied in quantum electrodynamics for development the quantum theory of the synchrotron radiation, i.e. for studies of motion and radiation of the electron in a magnetic field (see, for instance, [\cite=SokTerSynRad68]), and also for studies of the electrodynamics and weak interaction in different other configurations of external electromagnetic fields [\cite=RitNik1978]. This method is based on the Furry representation [\cite=FurPR51] in quantum electrodynamics (for more detailed discussion on this item see [\cite=StuAFdB06StuJPA08]) widely used for description of particles interactions in the presence of external electromagnetic fields. Recently it has been shown, that the method of exact solutions can be also applied for the problem of neutrinos and electron motion in presence of dense matter (see [\cite=StuAFdB06StuJPA08] for a review on this topic). Most pronouncedly this possibility was pointed out in [\cite=StuTerPLB05GriStuTerPLB05GriStuTerG&C05GriStuTerPAN06] [\cite=GriStuTer05-06] where the exact solution for the modified Dirac equation for a neutrino moving in matter was derived and discussed in details. The corresponding exact solution for an electron moving in matter was obtained in [\cite=Stu06GriShiStuTerTro07-08], the problem of neutrino propagation in transversally moving matter was first solved in [\cite=GriSavStu07], and in our recent paper [\cite=BalPopStu09] we considered neutrino propagation in a rotating matter accounting for the effect of nonzero neutrino mass.

Here we further develop the method of exact solutions for the problem of charged leptons propagating in matter and strong magnetic fields. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we discuss the general form of the modified Dirac equation for an electron moving in matter and magnetic field, and the corresponding spin operator is derived in Section 3. In Sections 4-6 the exact wave functions and energy spectrum are obtained. The general problem of eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a given class of Hamiltonians are discussed. In conclusion (Section 8) we examine the exact solutions obtained in Sections 2-6 for the particular case of the charged particle motion in a rotating neutron star with account for matter and magnetic field effects.

Modified Dirac Equation for electron moving in matter and magnetic field

We consider an electron propagating in nonmoving magnetized medium composed of neutrons and suppose, that magnetic field is homogeneous and constant. This can be regarded as the first approach to modelling of an electron propagation inside a neutron star. For distinctness we consider here the case of an electron, whereas generalization for other charged particles is just straightforward. We start with the modified Dirac equation for the electron wave function exactly accounting for the electron interaction with matter in the absence of magnetic field [\cite=StuTerPLB05GriStuTerPLB05GriStuTerG&C05GriStuTerPAN06] (see also [\cite=GriStuTer05-06]):

[formula]

This is the most general form of the equation for the electron wave function in which the effective potential [formula] includes both the neutral and charged current interactions of the electron with the background particles, and which can also account for effects of matter motion and polarization.

In order to include also an effect of an external electromagnetic field, we replace in eq. ([\ref=new]) the electron momentum pμ by the "extended" momentum: pμ  →  pμ + e0Aμ,

[formula]

where e0 is a module of the electron charge.

Note, that in general case it is not a trivial task to find solutions of this equation. In what follows we consider the particular case of constant magnetic field and nonmoving uniform matter, so that for the electromagnetic field and effective matter potential we obtain

[formula]

where [formula], n is matter number density. We rewrite equation ([\ref=new1]) in the Hamiltonian form and get

[formula]

where [formula]. Using the chiral representation of the γ-matrices we obtain the Hamiltonian in block matrix form:

[formula]

where [formula] are Pauli matrices. This form of the Hamiltonian makes quite transparent the solution describing spin properties of the electron.

Spin operator

It is obvious from ([\ref=bloc-diagonal_hamiltonian_1]), that the longitudinal polarization operator [formula] [\cite=SokTerSynRad68], where [formula] are the Dirac matrices, can be written in the form

[formula]

and commutes with the Hamiltonian, = 0. Therefore for any of its eigenvectors the Hamiltonian can be presented as the matrix:

[formula]

where T0 is one of the eigenvalues of the spin operator T̂0. Note, that the matrix ([\ref=matrix_of_hamiltonian]) is still [formula] one, and each its element is actually a product of the number by [formula] unit matrix. In turn, the transverse polarization operator does not commute with the Hamiltonian ([\ref=bloc-diagonal_hamiltonian_1]) because of the matter term Gn that breaks block symmetry of the Hamiltonian.

Energy spectrum of electron in matter and magnetic field

In order to find the electron energy spectrum p0 in the matter and constant magnetic field, ĤΨ = p0Ψ, we should solve the equation

[formula]

where p̃0 = p0 + 2Gn sin 2θW. The solutions can be written in the form

[formula]

where [formula] is the "sign" of the energy.

It is significant to note an interesting feature of the electron energy spectrum in the magnetized matter following from ([\ref=spectrum]). It is well known, that the energy spectrum of the electron in the magnetic field is degenerated in respect of spin quantum number (each electron Landau energy level in the magnetic field corresponds to both spin orientations). The presence of the matter (of any non-vanishing density [formula]) removes the degeneracy. This phenomenon can be attributed to the parity violation in weak interactions.

Let us emphasize one important relation between p0 and T0 that immediately follows from the spectrum ([\ref=spectrum]):

[formula]

where T0 is one of the eigenvalues of the spin operator T̂0. We use this relation in Section 7.

The electron wave functions

Note that we can considerably simplify the problem of finding wave functions if take into account some obvious facts. The solution of the equation ([\ref=Dirac_equation_1]) due to symmetries can be sought in the form

[formula]

Substituting ([\ref=psi]) into ([\ref=Dirac_equation_1]) we arrive at a system of linear equations for the electron wave function components:

[formula]

In the polar coordinates [formula] one obtains

[formula]

and the system of equations ([\ref=system1]) - ([\ref=system4]) reads now

[formula]

It is possible to show that the operator of the total momentum Jz = Lz + Sz, where [formula], [formula], commutes with the Hamiltonian. Therefore the solutions can be written in the form

[formula]

The solutions are the eigenvectors of the total momentum operator Jz with the corresponding eigenvalues [formula]. After substitution of ([\ref=form_of_solution]), the system ([\ref=nextsystem1]) - ([\ref=nextsystem4]) turns into:

[formula]

Now we define the "increasing" and "decreasing" operators

[formula]

and get the Hamiltonian in the following form,

[formula]

where Î is the unit matrix. Note that the derived form of the Hamiltonian is spectacular transparent that significantly simplify the problem of getting the explicit form of eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian ([\ref=Dirac_equation_1]). For forthcoming applications we take into consideration properties of operators R+ and R-:

[formula]

where Lls are the Laguerre functions [\cite=SokTerSynRad68].

The solution of system ([\ref=nextnextsystem1]) - ([\ref=nextnextsystem4]) (the eigenvector of the Hamiltonian ([\ref=matrix_form_of_hamiltonian])) can be written in the form

[formula]

Now we can get the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian (the energy spectrum) and of the spin operator T0,

[formula]

It is easy to see, that the spectrum ([\ref=spectrum]) obtained above is in agreement with expressions ([\ref=p_0]) and ([\ref=T^0]). From this energy spectrum, it is straightforward that the well-known energy spectrum in magnetic field (the Landau levels) is modified by interaction of the electron with matter. However the radius of the classical orbits corresponding to a certain level ([\ref=p_0]) doesn't depend on the matter density:

[formula]

To conclude this section we would like to note, that the effect of electron trapping on circular orbits in magnetized matter exists, and this can be important for astrophysical applications.

General problem of eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a given class of Hamiltonians

We argue in this Section, that the problem considered above is a particular case of more general problem, which concludes in a retrieval of eigenvectors and eigenvalues of Hamiltonians with a given general structure. The examples of these particular cases can be found in papers [\cite=SokTerSynRad68] [\cite=GriSavStu07] [\cite=BalPopStu09]. Taking into account the increasing interest to such Hamiltonians, we expect that their profound consideration would be important for applications.

Theorem. Let us take into account the following conditions:

1) H is a Hilbert space with the basis of eigenvectors ψ{n} of given quantum problem for a Dirac equation ( a matter and magnetic field are included);

2) in this space, the increasing and decreasing operators are determined

[formula]

where f-({n}) and f+({n}) are known functions that depend on the set of quantum numbers {n};

3) the Hamiltonian has one of the following explicit structures

[formula]

where m is the mass of a particle, p is (often a third) component of momentum, although here we could use other symbols for demonstration the general mathematical structure. Note that the theorem is also valid in other case when a certain class of replacements within the matrixes ([\ref=general_Hamiltonian_structure]) are made, for example, â  ↔  â+, [formula], [formula], p  ↔   - p, m  ↔   - m, etc. Nevertheless, the disposition of operators â, â+, and zeros in the matrixes important here. Note that there should be only one operator (â or â+) and only one zero in any string and any column. Remarkably, for any string or column the operators and zeros occupy only even or only odd positions.

In that case the following statements can be proved:

1) the eigenvector of such a Hamiltonian has the following form

[formula]

and the equation for the spectrum is (for the left structure in ([\ref=general_Hamiltonian_structure]))

[formula]

The equation for the right structure in ([\ref=general_Hamiltonian_structure]) can be written in analogous way. The spectrum can be obtained explicitly in the form

[formula]

2) the spin operator (one of the possible variants) can be constructed from the Hamiltonian. It is a matrix of operators, zeros, integrals of motion and other parameters (m). A structure of the spin operator corresponding to the Hamiltonians in ([\ref=general_Hamiltonian_structure]) can take one of the following variants:

[formula]

where all free positions [formula] should be filled in using the main condition = 0. Of course, some refinement of structure of spin operator (or any of its blocks) is possible, for example, â  →  câ, â+  →  c*â+, where c is a complex number, |c| = 1. Note that the main part of known spin operators (see, for example [\cite=SokTerSynRad68]) has such a structure.

The proof of the theorem

1. Let us substitude the solution ([\ref=general_solution]) into equation Ĥψ = Eψ where Ĥ is given by one of the explicit structures ([\ref=general_Hamiltonian_structure]). The homogenious system of linear equations is now obtained. The equation ([\ref=general_equation_for_the_spectrum]) is a criterion of its nonzero solution, and it is the equation for energy spectrum. To obtain the spectrum ([\ref=general_spectrum]) we should solve this equation, what is trivial.

2. Let us demonstrate now that the structure ([\ref=general_structure_of_spin_operator]) of spin operator is adequate to the considered model. Here we study a particular case that similar to one presented in Section 3, other cases can be solved in an analogous way. We take into consideration that the Hamiltonian H is given by structure the right-handed part of ([\ref=general_Hamiltonian_structure]) and the spin operator we can find in the following form

[formula]

We should check the main condition = 0. After substitution the specified expressions for H and S into this equation we obtain a system of linear equations for finding the coefficients si:

[formula]

One of the solutions can be taken in the form s1 = s3 =  - p, s2 = s4 = p, s5 = s6 = 0, and the corresponding spin operator can be presented as follows

[formula]

We see that obtained spin operator is similar to one used in Section 3.

Remark 1. The symmetry of the Hamiltonian can be violated as described in Sections 1-4. There we deal with the Hamiltonian that differs from ([\ref=general_Hamiltonian_structure], right) by the term Bγ5, and B is a constant. In that case, the spin operator can be constructed in the form

[formula]

and the spectrum depends on spin quantum number similar to eq. ([\ref=p_0]). Note that the spin operator ([\ref=matrix_form_of_spin_operator]) is similar to that in eq. ([\ref=structure_of_block_spin_operator]).

Remark 2. The theorem can be generalized to the Hamiltonians of more complicated structures namely

[formula]

The equation for the spectrum for this model (e.g., for the left side of eq. ([\ref=general_Hamiltonian_structure])) is

[formula]

However, to solve this equation is not a simple task.

Remark 3. It is not obvious from the matrix form of the Hamiltonian ([\ref=matrix_form_of_hamiltonian]), that it is a self-conjugate operator. To prove this, the properties of "increasing" and "decreasing" operators should be considered more carefully. A sequenced collection of functions [formula] constitute a basis in the Hilbert space with scalar product defined as

[formula]

So that, we get for each s and l

[formula]

Hence for operators ([\ref=increasing_and_decreasing_operators]) we obtain (R-)* =  - R+ and (R+)* =  - R-, where symbol *   implies Hermitian conjugation of operators. From the matrix form of the Hamiltonian ([\ref=matrix_form_of_hamiltonian]) we see that H* = H. So that we can use the theorem for this case.

Note that the increasing and decreasing operators can be used effectively in this problem because we need in only one basis Lls for constructing the spinor ([\ref=solution]). In more complicated models, we seem should take two or even more different basis functions for constructing a solution.

Spin coefficients

We go back now to the Hamiltonian ([\ref=matrix_of_hamiltonian]). In order to find its eigenvectors, we consider the following chain of transformations

[formula]

[formula]

Hence, we obtain

[formula]

In the same way we obtain the following expressions for C2 and C4:

[formula]

where A and B are new constants.

Getting of the relation between C1 and C2 (and between C3 and C4) is similar. Namely, we should use the equations

[formula]

We finally get

[formula]

with the only coefficient C which has to be defined from the normalization condition C21 + C22 + C23 + C24 = 1. We obtain [formula]. Finally, we obtain the wave function:

[formula]

where

[formula]

and L is a normalizing factor.

Equations ([\ref=exact_solution])-([\ref=coefficients_2]) represent the exact solution of ([\ref=Dirac_equation_1]) with the Hamiltonian ([\ref=bloc-diagonal_hamiltonian_1]) that describes the electron moving in matter and magnetic field. Note that in the case n = 0, these formulas are reduced to well-known solutions for the electron wave functions in a constant homogeneous magnetic field [\cite=SokTerSynRad68].

Application

It is important to point out, that the obtained exact solution for the electron motion in matter and magnetic field can be used as the first approximation of description of particles moving in an external environment of more complicated configuration. As an example, we demonstrate how the problem of an electron (or another charged particle) motion in a rotating matter with magnetic field can be solved. This problem is of interest in different astrophysical contexts.

If the angular velocity ω is small compare to the magnetic field, we can calculate the spectrum using a standard perturbation theory with the small parameter [formula]. If, for example, we choose for the matter density, angular velocity and magnetic field the values peculiar for a rotating neutron star ([formula]), then the parameter is really small,

[formula]

Now we can take the spectrum and wave functions found above (i.e., without rotation) as the lowest order of perturbation series and find the correction term.

We consider the particular case of constant magnetic field and rotating uniform matter so that the electromagnetic field and effective matter potential are given by

[formula]

where [formula]. Let us rewrite eq. ([\ref=new1]) in the Hamiltonian form

[formula]

with [formula]. Using again the chiral representation of the γ-matrices we obtain the Hamiltonian in block-matrix form:

[formula]

It is obvious from ([\ref=bloc-diagonal_hamiltonian]), that H = H0 + H1, where H1 is the last term of ([\ref=bloc-diagonal_hamiltonian]) and takes the following form in the polar coordinates

[formula]

So, we get for the first correction to the energy spectrum ([\ref=spectrum]) of the electron

[formula]

where C1 and C2 are the coefficients from eq. ([\ref=C_1_and_C_2]). The integral can be calculated explicitly, and finally we get

[formula]

This shift of levels in the energy spectrum depending on the energy quantum number N = 0,1,2... leads to a corresponding shift in a frequency of synchrotron radiation of electron inside of dense rotating matter, that can be registered.

Conclusion

In this paper we found a class of exact solutions of the modified Dirac equation which describes the charged leptons propagating in uniform matter and strong constant magnetic field. We also pointed out, how this approach can be generalized to a given class of Dirac Hamiltonians. Obtained solution for the particular case of the electron motion in a rotating neutron star with account for matter and magnetic field effects can be used as the first approximation in more complicated models. All of these considerations can be useful for astrophysical applications.
