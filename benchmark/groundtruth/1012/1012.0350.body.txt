Noncommutative Tate curves

Introduction

A. The Pontryagin duality establishes a canonical isomorphism between the locally compact abelian group G and the group [formula], where [formula] is the group of characters of G, i.e. the homomorphisms G  →  S1 [\cite=Pon1]; such a duality generalizes the correspondence between the periodic function and its Fourier series. The aim of the underlying note is the Pontryagin duality between a geometric object known as the Tate curve and a class of the operator algebras known as the Uniformly Hyper-Finite algebras (the UHF-algebras) [\cite=Gli1]; such a duality provides a (little studied) link between algebraic geometry of elliptic curves and their noncommutative topology. Roughly speaking, our result says that the K-theory of a UHF-algebra is a "Fourier series" of the abelian variety over the field of p-adic numbers; the details of the construction are given below.

B. The Tate curve. We shall work with a plane cubic Eq:y2 + xy = x3 + a4(q)x + a6(q), such that

[formula]

where q is a p-adic number satisfying condition 0 < |q| < 1. The series ([\ref=eq1]) are convergent and, therefore, Eq is an elliptic curve defined over the field of p-adic numbers [formula]; it is called a Tate curve [\cite=Tat1], p.190. There exists a remarkable uniformization of Eq by the lattice [formula]; an exact result is this. Let [formula] be the group of units of [formula] and consider an action x  ↦  qx for [formula]; the action is discrete and, therefore, the quotient [formula] is a Hausdorff topological space. It was proved by Tate, that there exists an (analytic) isomorphism [formula]; it follows from the last formula, that [formula] (see p.5).

C. The UHF-algebras. A UHF-algebra ("Uniformly Hyper-Finite C*-algebra") is a C*-algebra which is isomorphic to the inductive limit of the sequence

[formula]

where [formula] is a matrix C*-algebra and [formula]; we shall denote the UHF-algebra by [formula], where [formula]. The UHF-algebras [formula] and [formula] are said to be stably isomorphic (Morita equivalent), whenever [formula], where K is the C*-algebra of compact operators; such an isomorphism means, that from the standpoint of noncommutative topology [formula] and [formula] are homeomorphic topological spaces. To classify the UHF-algebras up to the stable isomorphism, one needs the following construction. Let p be a prime number and [formula]; denote by [formula] an infinite sequence of ni as pi runs the ordered set of all primes. By [formula] we understand an additive subgroup of [formula] consisting of rational numbers, whose denominators divide the "supernatural number" [formula]; the [formula] is a dense subgroup of [formula] and every dense subgroup of [formula] containing [formula] is given by [formula] for some [formula]. The UHF-algebra [formula] and the group [formula] are connected by the formula [formula], where [formula] is the K0-group of the C*-algebra [formula]. The UHF-algebras [formula] and [formula] are stably isomorphic if and only if [formula] for some positive integers r and s [\cite=E], p.28.

D. The result. Denote by {an}∞n = 1 a canonical sequence of the p-adic number q, i.e. the sequence of integers 0  ≤  an  ≤  pn - 1, such that |q - an|  ≤  pn; the sequence is unique and satisfies the equation [formula]. Consider the rational numbers [formula] and let

[formula]

be an additive subgroup of [formula] generated by γn; it is a dense subgroup of [formula] containing [formula] (lemma [\ref=lm1]). Finally, let [formula] be a UHF-algebra, such that [formula]; our main result can be stated as follows.

The discrete group K0(Mq) is the Pontryagin dual of the continuous group [formula].

The note is organized as follows. Theorem [\ref=thm1] is proved in Section 2 and a numerical example of the duality is constructed in Section 3.

Proof

We split the proof in a series of lemmas; for the notation and preliminary facts, we refer the reader to [\cite=E]-[\cite=Tat1].

Let q  ≠  0. Then:

(i) [formula];

(ii) [formula].

Proof. Recall that every p-adic integer can be uniquely written as [formula], where 0  ≤  bi  ≤  p - 1; the integers bi are related to the canonical sequence by the formulas:

[formula]

Note that q = 0 if and only if all bi = 0. If q  ≠  0, some bi  ≠  0; thus, there are infinitely many ai  ≠  0. Therefore, group Γq has an infinite number of the non-trivial generators.

(i) Let γ and γ' be a pair of non-trivial generators of Γq; clearly, their nominators a and a' are integers and belong to Γq. By the Euclidean algorithm, the equation ra - sa' = 1 has a solution in integers r and s; thus, 1∈Γq and [formula]. The first part of lemma [\ref=lm1] follows.

(ii) In view of formulas ([\ref=eq4]), we have

[formula]

where ≈   means the first approximation (the main part) of a rational number; thus, [formula]. Consider a pair of generators γn and γn'; then pγn  ≈  bn and pγn'  ≈  bn'. Since pγn∈Γq and pγn'∈Γq, the element bn'(pγn) - bn(pγn') also belongs to Γq. But pbn'γn - pbnγn'  ≈  0 and, therefore, there are elements of the group Γq, which are arbitrary close to zero. To prove part (ii), assume to the contrary that [formula]; then there exists [formula] and the closest γ∈Γq, such that [formula]. Take γ'∈Γq such that |γ'| = ε0  <  ε; then γ  -  γ' lies between γ and r / s. Thus, γ is not the closest to r / s; this contradiction proves, that [formula]. Lemma [\ref=lm1] follows. [formula]

Recall that the abelian group

[formula]

is called quasicyclic (or Prüfer) group [\cite=F], p.15; the following lemma clarifies the algebraic structure of Γq.

[formula] whenever |q| < 1.

Proof. Let us verify the condition pγ1 = 0. Since |q| < 1, the p-adic number q is not a unit of the ring of p-adic integers [formula]; therefore, in the canonical sequence for q the integer a1 = 0. On the other hand, pγ1 = a1 and, thus, pγ1 = 0.

Let us verify the condition pγn + 1  =  γn for n  ≥  1; it follows from formulas ([\ref=eq4]), that:

[formula]

Since

[formula]

we have pγn + 1  =  γn + bn + 1, where bn + 1 is an integer; thus, [formula]. Lemma [\ref=lm2] follows. [formula]

Every [formula] is a character of the abelian group [formula].

Proof. Since [formula], by lemmas [\ref=lm1]-[\ref=lm2] there exists a map [formula]; note, that iq is correctly defined for 0 < |q| < 1 and extends to q = 0 and q = 1. Let us show, that iq is a homomorphism. Indeed, if [formula], then [formula]. Thus, the map [formula] is a homomorphism, i.e. iq is a character of the group [formula]. [formula]

In view of lemma [\ref=lm3], we have [formula], where [formula] is the group of characters of the abelian group. Note, that in the p-adic topology [formula] is a compact totally disconnected abelian group whose group operation is the addition of the p-adic numbers; likewise, [formula] is a discrete abelian group endowed with the discrete topology. Since [formula], by the First Fundamental Theorem [\cite=Pon1] there exists a canonical continuous isomorphism [formula]; the isomorphism sends [formula] into the character [formula] defined by the formula:

[formula]

Thus, [formula] is the Pontryagin dual of the group [formula].

Let us show, that [formula]. Indeed, each elliptic curve E is isomorphic to its own Jacobian, i.e. [formula], where Ω1(E) is the vector space of analytic differentials on E. Since [formula] and [formula], we conclude that [formula]; then by the Universal Coefficient Formula one gets [formula]. Theorem [\ref=thm1] is proved. [formula]

Example

We shall consider an example illustrating theorem [\ref=thm1]. Let p be a prime and consider the p-adic integer q = p; to obtain the canonical sequence for q, notice that:

[formula]

Thus, b2 = 1 and [formula]; the canonical sequence [formula] for q = p takes the form [formula] and, therefore, the generators γ1 = 0 and [formula] for n  ≥  2. In this case one gets the following dense subgroup of [formula]:

[formula]

Thus [formula], where [formula]; therefore, [formula], where [formula]. In other words, the UHF-algebra corresponding to the Tate curve [formula] has the form:

[formula]

We conclude that the UHF-algebra Mp∞ is the "Fourier series" of the Tate curve Ep; in the particular case p = 2 one gets a duality between the Tate curve E2 and the UHF-algebra M2∞, which is known as the Canonical Anticommutation Relations C*-algebra (the CAR or Fermion algebra) [\cite=E], p.13.
