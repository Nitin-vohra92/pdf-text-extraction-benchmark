Spin relaxation and linear-in-electric-field frequency shift in an arbitrary, time-independent magnetic field

Introduction

An experiment to measure the neutron electric dipole moment (nEDM), to be installed at the FnPB beamline at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, will utilize a helium-3 comagnetometer in the central, superfluid-helium-filled measurement cell [\cite=nedm_phys_report][\cite=nedm_proposal]. The helium-3 polarization must remain high over the entire measurement period, ~  1000 seconds, as the helium atoms precess in the holding field and diffuse within a rectangular cell. Also, as there is a strong electric field [formula] applied across the cell, a subtle effect, in which the interplay of the motional [formula] field with gradients in the static magnetic field cause the precession frequency to shift linearly with [formula] [\cite=vxE_ref], must be well-understood or shown to be negligible. Design optimization of the experimental apparatus includes calculating the helium-3 spin relaxation times T1, T2, and linear-in-electric-field frequency shift δωE due to given magnetic field non-uniformities.

In this article, a method is shown to calculate these quantities in the diffusion approximation in a rectangular cell and for an arbitrary magnetic field. The starting point for the relaxation times is the Redfield theory of spin relaxation [\cite=redfield]. In second order perturbation theory these can be written, for a holding field in the z direction, as [\cite=slichter]

[formula]

[formula]

where the spectral density is given in terms of magnetic field perturbations hi(t),

[formula]

Here, the total field in each direction i is Hi(t)  =  〈Hi(t)〉  +  hi(t), such that average perturbation 〈hi(t)〉  =  0, and ω0  =  γ〈Hz(t)〉 is the average spin precession frequency.

McGregor [\cite=mcgregor90] calculated the ensemble average correlation of the field perturbations seen by a diffusing particle in the case of a time-independent, uniform gradient of Hz in the x-direction,

[formula]

resulting in an analytic expression for T2 in a rectangular cell,

[formula]

We relax the requirement of uniform gradient and find, in the case of a rectangular prism cell, that T1 and T2 can be written in terms of the components of the 3D cosine transform of [formula] over the cell volume. The same technique is applied to dressed spins [\cite=spin_dressing_ref], with uniform holding field and non-uniform dressing field, by mapping non-uniformities in the dressing field to equivalent non-uniformities in the holding field. In Section [\ref=sec:vxE], a variation of the technique is used for the linear-in-electric-field frequency shift. Finally, as an example, in Section [\ref=sec:example] the relaxation times and linear-in-electric-field frequency shift due to a superconducting rod near the cell are computed.

Correlation functions in the diffusion limit

The correlation function of hi can be expressed as integrals over the cell volume weighted by the probability density [formula] that the particle is at [formula] at the initial time t0, and the joint probability density [formula] that a particle at [formula] at time t0 will be at [formula] at time t. Thus, [\cite=mcgregor90]

[formula]

The particle density will be taken as uniform in the cell, [formula]. The joint probability is the solution to the diffusion equation,

[formula]

subject to reflecting boundary conditions at the walls,

[formula]

where [formula] and n̂ is normal to the wall. In a rotated coordinate system (x',y',z') aligned with the cell walls, the solution for a Lx  ×  Ly  ×  Lz box with walls at x' =   ±  Lx / 2, y' =   ±  Ly / 2 and z' =   ±  Lz / 2 is

[formula]

with the 1D solution dependent on the time difference τ  =  t  -  t0, [\cite=mcgregor90]

[formula]

It will be convenient to recognize the following:

[formula]

Putting Eq. [\ref=eq:prtr0t0] and [formula] into Eq. [\ref=eq:hqq_tau], changing the limits of integration to 0  ≤  q'i  ≤  Li for each dimension q'i and using Eq. [\ref=eq:prtr0t0_shifted], we have

[formula]

in which the factor Cn has been introduced,

[formula]

We identify the 3D cosine transform of [formula] within Eq. [\ref=eq:hqq_tau2],

[formula]

(where the integral is over the range x'∈[0,Lx], y'∈[0,Ly], z'∈[0,Lz]), giving finally

[formula]

with the characteristic time τc for a given spatial mode defined by

[formula]

Putting this expression into Eq. [\ref=eq:kqq_def] and performing the integral over τ gives

[formula]

Substitution into Eqs. [\ref=eq:T1] and [\ref=eq:T2] results in complete expressions for the longitudinal and transverse relaxation times.

For arbitrary fields including field maps, the cosine-transform amplitudes A can be numerically calculated by fast discrete cosine transform (DCT) over [formula] sampled at a sufficient number of points throughout the cell volume. In this case the summation over nq is truncated accordingly, and accuracy is checked by increasing the number of sample points and comparing results.

Extension to dressed spins with non-uniform dressing field

An RF magnetic field with amplitude B1 applied transverse to the holding field B0 modifies the effective precession frequency of a particle. In terms of dimensionless "dressing parameters" [\cite=chu_dressed_spin]

[formula]

in the limit Y  ≪  1 the effective gyromagnetic ratio becomes [\cite=spin_dressing_ref]

[formula]

Thus for a dressing field with spatially varying amplitude [formula], the equivalent variation δ0 in the holding field B0 is given by [\cite=nedm_phys_report]

[formula]

The expressions from the previous sections can be used to calculate T2 for the dressed spin with a non-uniform dressing field by setting

[formula]

where the variation δB0 in the holding field itself has been included in hz.

Linear electric field frequency shift

A spin moving though an electric field experiences a motional magnetic field that may, in conjunction with gradients of the magnetic field, produce a shift in the precession frequency dependent on the electric field direction and magnitude. [\cite=vxE_ref] Of particular concern in searches for electric dipole moments are effects that are linearly proportional to the electric field E. These may mimic effects expected for an electric dipole moment, thereby creating a "false EDM."

As shown by Lamoreaux and Golub [\cite=lamgol05_vxE], the linear-in-electric-field frequency shift for spins in a confined volume is given by the expression

[formula]

where the perturbations can be written more generally as

[formula]

Expanding the expression for δωE and keeping only terms linear in E results in

[formula]

The cosine-transform method developed in the present work can be used to compute Eq. [\ref=eq:deltaomega] in the diffusion limit for the nEDM cell geometry. While the expressions,

[formula]

were used in Ref. [\cite=lamgol05_vxE] to eliminate y in favor of an expression with vy, here we remove the velocity components from the correlation functions and use instead the Fundmental Theorem of Calculus and the above expression for y(t - τ). The correlation functions can then be written

[formula]

[formula]

In the latter expression, averages are assumed to be independent of the overall time offset t, as appropriate for a stationary problem.

The expressions in Section [\ref=sec:corr] are modified to give the correlation function in the diffusion limit in terms of the cosine-transform components of [formula] and [formula],

[formula]

[formula]

Performing the integral in Eq. [\ref=eq:deltaomega], we have

[formula]

leading to an expression for the frequency shift,

[formula]

The summation can be reduced by computing the cosine transform components of [formula] and [formula] analytically,

[formula]

The result for the frequency shift in the diffusion approximation is

[formula]

Example application employing the discrete cosine transform

The bulk of the computational effort required for practical application of the present technique is in finding the cosine transform amplitudes [formula] of the field non-uniformities. The form of Eq. [\ref=eq:An] is amenable to numerical computation with Fast Fourier Transform software libraries. The example below uses the multidimensional discrete cosine transform (DCT) feature of the freely-available software library FFTW3 [\cite=fftw3_ref]. Input to the DCT for each field component is an array of field perturbations [formula] sampled over the cell volume at NxNyNz grid points, and the output is an array of DCT amplitudes which, after scaling by 1 / (8NxNyNz), correspond to the desired amplitudes [formula]. The summations in Eqs. [\ref=eq:kqq] and [\ref=eq:dw_result] are truncated according to the amplitudes available from the DCT. Accuracy of the result can be checked by increasing the number of sample points and repeating the computation.

We calculate the effect of a superconducting rod placed near the cell in an otherwise uniform holding field. For an infinite-length rod along the z axis and through the origin in a magnetic field B0 applied along the x axis, the net field around the rod is [\cite=poole]

[formula]

where a is the rod radius and (ρ,φ) are polar coordinates in the xy plane. While the cosine transforms of Bx, By derived from these equations (appropriately translated to the desired location of the superconducting rod) could perhaps be calculated analytically, here the equations are used to generate a field map that is subsequently run through the machinery to produce values for T1, T2, and δωE. Results are shown in Figure [\ref=fig:example], with physical parameters given in the caption.

Conclusion

A method to calculate spin relaxation times and the linear-in-E frequency shift in the diffusion approximation was presented. The technique is based on the observation that, for a particle diffusing in a rectangular cell, the correlation function of a position-dependent field is the weighted sum over the squared cosine-transform components of the field (see Eq. [\ref=eq:gqq]).

As the formulation is intended for practical computation in a rectagular cell, the result is for the complete 3-dimensional geometry. It could also be applied to a cylindrical cell if the field variation in coordinates transverse to the cylinder axis can be neglected. Actual computation is done using fast discrete cosine transforms of the field components. This method could be used for example in magnet coil design optimization: given a field map, T1, T2, and δωE can be quickly evalulated and combined into a figure of merit.
