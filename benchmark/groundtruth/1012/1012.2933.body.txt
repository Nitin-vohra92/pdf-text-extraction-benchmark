Introduction

In this paper we study the Yablonskii-Vorob'ev polynomials Qn, with a special interest in their roots. These polynomials were derived by Yablonskii and Vorob'ev, while examining the hierarchy of rational solutions of the second Painlevé equation. The Yablonskii-Vorob'ev polynomials are defined by the differential-difference equation with Q0 = 1 and Q1 = z. From the recurrence relation, it is clear that the functions Qn are rational, though it is far from obvious that they are polynomials, since in every iteration one divides by Qn - 1. The Yablonskii-Vorob'ev polynomials Qn are monic polynomials of degree [formula], with integer coefficients. The first few are given in Table [\ref=tableQn].

Yablonskii [\cite=yablonskii] and Vorob'ev [\cite=vorob] expressed the rational solutions of the second Painlevé equation,

[formula]

with complex parameter α, in terms of the Yablonskii-Vorob'ev polynomials, as summerized in the following theorem:

PII(α) has a rational solution iff [formula]. For [formula] the rational solution is unique and if n  ≥  1, then it is equal to

[formula]

The other rational solutions are given by w0 = 0 and for n  ≥  1, w- n =  - wn.

The rational solutions of PII can also be determined, using the Bäcklund transformations, first given by Gambier [\cite=gambier], of the second Painlevé equation, by with "seed solution" w0 = 0; see also Lukashevich [\cite=lukashevich] and Noumi [\cite=noumi].

We note that the Yablonskii-Vorob'ev polynomials find many applications in physics. For instance, solutions of the Korteweg-de Vries equation (Airault, McKean and Moser [\cite=airault]) and the Boussinesq equation (Clarkson [\cite=clarksonboussinesq]) can be expressed in terms of these polynomials. Clarkson and Mansfield [\cite=clarksonmansfield] studied the structure of the roots of the Yablonskii-Vorob'ev polynomials Qn and observed that the roots, of each of these polynomials, form a highly regular triangular-like pattern, for n  ≤  7, suggesting that they have interesting properties. This further motivates studying the zeros of the Yablonskii-Vorob'ev polynomials.

In Section [\ref=section2] the divisibility of the coefficients of the Yablonskii-Vorob'ev polynomials by powers of 4 is examined. From the divisibility properties found, we conclude that nonzero roots of the Yablonskii-Vorob'ev polynomials are irrational. In Section [\ref=section3] we study power series expansions of (functions related to) the rational solution wn of PII(n), around poles of wn. This leads to relations between the roots of Qn - 1 and Qn. These relations suggest deeper connections between the zeros of Qn - 1 and Qn. Similarly, we look at power series expansions of (functions related to) the rational solution wn of PII(n) around 0, in Section [\ref=section4]. We obtain polynomial expressions in n, with rational coefficients, for sums of fixed negative powers of the nonzero roots of Qn.

Nonzero roots are irrational

The Yablonskii-Vorob'ev polynomials Qn are monic polynomials of degree [formula], and Taneda [\cite=taneda] proved:

if [formula], then [formula];

if [formula], then [formula].

Therefore, we have for certain [formula], with convention an0 = 1, where [formula] denotes the floor function.

For every [formula], we have 4m|anm.

We proceed by proving the following statement, by induction, for all [formula]:

For every 1  ≤  m  ≤  M, for all [formula], whenever [formula], we have 4m|anm, and Observe that the case M = 0 is trivial. Now suppose the statement is true for [formula]. Then there are [formula], such that for every [formula],

[formula]

where [formula] is zero or has degree less or equal to [formula], and if [formula], then bnm = 0.

To complete the induction, we need to show that for every [formula], 4|Pn. We prove this by induction with respect to n. Observe that P0 = 0 and P1 = 0, therefore, indeed 4|P0 and 4|P1. Assume 4|Pn - 1 and 4|Pn. Then [formula], therefore, modulo 4M + 1, we have: By the definition of Qn + 1 [\eqref=eqqn],

[formula]

so

Let us consider Qn + 1Qn - 1. Since 4|Pn - 1, we have

[formula]

therefore, modulo 4M + 1, Since we have, modulo 4M + 1, Hence, by [\eqref=eqdiv] and [\eqref=eqdiv2],

[formula]

which implies

[formula]

Since we have, therefore, 4|Pn + 1. Hence, by induction, for all [formula], 4|Pn.

The lemma follows by induction on M.

Let us denote the coefficient of the lowest degree term in Qn by

[formula]

i.e. xn is the constant coefficient in Qn if [formula], and xn is the coefficient of z in Qn if [formula]. Fukutani, Okamoto, and Umemura [\cite=fukutani] proved that the roots of the Yablonskii-Vorob'ev polynomials are simple, hence xn is nonzero. Let pn be the multiplicity of 2 in the prime factorization of xn. As a consequence of Lemma [\ref=coeflemma], we obtain that [formula]. We prove

[formula]

Observe that xn = Qn(0) if [formula], and xn = Qn'(0) if [formula]. Fukutani, Okamoto, and Umemura [\cite=fukutani] derived the following identity for the Yablonskii-Vorob'ev polynomials:

[formula]

Using this identity at 0, we obtain

[formula]

By evaluating equation [\eqref=eqqn] at 0,

[formula]

Therefore, we have the following recursion for (xn)n: So, we obtain the following recursion for (pn)n: Using this recursion, the formula [formula], can be proven directly, by induction.

Kaneko and Ochiai [\cite=kaneko] found an explicit expression for the coefficients xn. But deriving the formula [formula] directly from this expression seems to be a difficult task.

The nonzero roots of the Yablonskii-Vorob'ev polynomials are irrational.

Let [formula]. Suppose x is a rational root of Qn. Since [formula] is monic, by Gauss's lemma, [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=coeflemma],

[formula]

so x is even. Let [formula], then, by equation [\eqref=eqcoef],

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=coeflemma], for every [formula], we have 4m|anm. Hence So

[formula]

which implies

[formula]

But [formula], a contradiction, hence roots of Qn are irrational.

If [formula], we can apply the same reasoning to [formula], and show that roots of [formula] are irrational. Therefore, nonzero roots of Qn are irrational.

This result raises the question whether the Yablonskii-Vorob'ev polynomials, excluding the trivial factor z in case [formula], are irreducible in [formula]. Kametaka [\cite=kametaka] showed that for n  ≤  23, the Yablonskii-Vorob'ev polynomials Qn are indeed irreducible.

Relations between roots of the Yablonskii-Vorob'ev polynomials

By Theorem [\ref=thmYV], for n  ≥  1, the unique rational solution of PII(n) is given by

[formula]

Fukutani, Okamoto, and Umemura [\cite=fukutani] proved that the roots of the Yablonskii-Vorob'ev polynomials are simple, hence where the zm,k are the roots of Qm. From equation [\eqref=eqyn] and the fact that wn is the rational solution of PII(n), we obtain relations between the zeros of Qn - 1 and Qn.

For [formula]: For [formula]:

Let [formula] and define ω: = zn - 1,j and [formula]. Since gcd (Qn  -  1,Qn) = 1, see Fukutani, Okamoto, and Umemura [\cite=fukutani], equation [\eqref=eqyn] shows that u is holomorphic in a neighbourhood of ω. Hence u has a power series expansion, say

[formula]

which converges in an open disc centered at ω.

Since wn is a solution of PII(n), u satisfies Hence we have the following identity in an open disc centered at ω: By considering coefficients of (z - ω)n, n = 0,1,2,4, it is easy to deduce that a0 = 0, [formula], [formula] and [formula]. Note that a3 does not follow from considering coefficients of (z - ω)3.

By Taylor's theorem and equation [\eqref=eqyn], The first half of the theorem follows, the second half is proved analogously.

Note that countably many nontrivial relations can be found between the am in the above proof, by considering the coefficient of (z - ω)n, for [formula].

In Kudryashov and Demina [\cite=kudryashov] similar relations for the roots of Qn are obtained using the Korteweg-de Vries equation. In particular, the following results are presented in [\cite=kudryashov] for [formula]: From these relations and Theorem [\ref=TREL], we obtain the following corollary:

For [formula]: For [formula]:

In Theorem [\ref=TREL], we have obtained 4 times [formula] plus 4 times [formula] equations satisfied by the [formula] roots of Qn, suggesting that these equations can be used to determine the roots of the polynomials Qn recursively. If so, then these equations may be of use to derive properties of the roots of the Yablonskii-Vorob'ev polynomials. We shall not pursue this issue further here.

Sums of negative powers of roots

In Section [\ref=section2], the rational solutions wn of PII(n) were studied around roots of the Yablonskii-Vorob'ev polynomials. In this section, we consider wn at 0.

Let [formula], then 0 is not a root of Qn - 1 or Qn. Therefore, by equation [\eqref=eqyn], wn is holomorphic in a neighbourhood of 0. So wn has a power series expansion, say

[formula]

which converges on an open disc centered at 0.

By Taylor's theorem and equation [\eqref=eqyn], we have

[formula]

Let [formula]. Since [formula], [formula]. Therefore, the roots of Qn are invariant under multiplication by ω. Hence

[formula]

therefore, if [formula], By the same reason, if [formula],

[formula]

So am = 0, if [formula], and in an open disc centered at 0,

[formula]

Since wn is a solution of PII(n), we have the following identity in an open disc centered at 0:

[formula]

Comparing coefficients gives [formula], [formula] and [formula]. We have obtained the following relations for [formula]:

If [formula], then [formula] is holomorphic at 0 and satisfies

[formula]

By considering the power series expansion of [formula] around 0, the following relations are found:

If [formula], then [formula] is holomorphic at 0 and satisfies

[formula]

By considering the power series expansion of [formula] around 0, the following relations are found:

Considering higher order coefficients, we see that for every threefold m  ≥  3, polynomial expressions in n, with rational coefficients, depending on n mod 3, exist for

[formula]

As a corollary of these relations, by induction, we obtain: By Remark [\ref=remark], for every threefold m  ≥  3, polynomial expressions in n, with rational coefficients, depending on n mod 3, exist for

[formula]

If [formula], see equation [\eqref=eqzero], then

[formula]

So, for all [formula],

[formula]

even though the nonzero roots of the Yablonskii-Vorob'ev polynomials are irrational.
