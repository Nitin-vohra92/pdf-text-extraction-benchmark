Abstract

The light gluino hypothesis can explain the apparent incompatibility between the measurements of αs at low- and high-energy. Such gluinos are produced directly in four-jet events, for which we perform a detailed analysis. Because the jet energies are not large, the effect of the non-zero gluino mass is important. We take the gluino mass into account in the computation of the cross sections and shape variables. As expected, we find that mass effects tend to reduce the impact of the gluinos in the cross section, weakening the bounds from obtaining assuming massless gluinos.

In recent years, many precision tests of QCD have been carried out at LEP and, in particular, much attention has been devoted to the measurement of the strong coupling constant at the MZ scale, αs(MZ). These measurements can be compared with the values extracted from deep inelastic experiments, at lower energies, and evolved using the standard QCD renormalization group equation. It has already been noted that there is a slight discrepancy between the results obtained in this way. The LEP measurements yield an average of αs(MZ)  =  0.122  ±  0.006, while the deep inelastic values suggest αs(MZ)  =  0.112  ±  0.005 [\cite=alpha]. Of course the statistical significance of this discrepancy is very small, but nonetheless it has led to speculation that the evolution of coupling is being slowed down by a contribution to the β-function of a new light, neutral, coloured fermion, the so-called light gluino' hypothesis [\cite=kuhn]. Although it is theoretically difficult to reconcile such an object with a realistic supersymmetric Standard Model, there is in fact an experimental window open precisely in the few GeV region [\cite=gluino-window]. A gluino of this mass, in the adjoint representation, would slow the evolution between the deep inelastic and LEP scales by just the correct amount to reconcile the αs(MZ) mesurements. In simple terms,

[formula]

Note that the above threshold, the effect is the same as increasing the number of quark flavours, nf  →  nf  +  3. Of course the presence of a light gluino also modifies the values extracted for α, but the effects are fairly small compared to the experimental uncertainties on the measured αs values [\cite=ellis2].

It is certainly worth looking for evidence of the light gluino in other processes. At LEP, gluino pairs can be produced directly at O(α2s), i.e. as a contribution to the four-jet cross section [\cite=farrar]. One can, at least in principle, extract from the data the number of light hadronic fermion pairs contributing to e+e-  →  qf. Naively, a light gluino would increase nf by three, just as for the evolution of the coupling constant. The main purpose of this note is to analyse the four-jet event rate at LEP energies, in order to quantify as the effect due to gluino production. In particular, we are primarily interested in the effect of the non-zero mass [formula] on the cross section. Previously analyses [\cite=farrar] [\cite=aleph] [\cite=opal] [\cite=hebbeker] have assumed massless quarks, gluons and gluinos, but since the energies of the gluino jets are not large, mass effects will presumably be important.

In Fig. 1(a)-(d) we show the lowest order Feynman graphs for 4-jet production in QCD. The gluino contributes through gluon splitting processes of type (d), shown in Fig. 2. To study the effect of a non-zero gluino mass, we have computed the matrix element for e+e-  →  q with [formula], using the spinor techniques of reference [\cite=spinor]. In Fig. 3 we show (solid line) the total cross section [formula], normalized to the leading order (two-jet) cross section [formula], as a function of [formula]. Note that this cross section is infra-red finite for [formula]. For [formula], the cross section falls exponentially with the gluino mass. In order to define the part of this which corresponds to the four-jet cross section we need to introduce a jet algorithm. In what follows we will adopt the widely-used JADE algorithm, i.e. we introduce a dimensionless parameter ycut and require that jets i and j be separated in phase space according to

[formula]

where θij is the angle between the jets with energies Ei and Ej respectively. In our calculation, the indices 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  4 run over the four final-state partons. Fig. 3 shows the gluino pair contribution to the four-jet cross section defined in this way, for three ycut values, again as a function of [formula]. Notice that for ycut = 0.01, the cross section decreases by a factor of two going from [formula] to [formula].

In Fig. 4 the various contributions to the total four-jet cross section (i.e. summed over the processes shown in Figs. 1 and 2) are presented, as a function of ycut. As can be seen, by far the most important contribution is from the qgg final state. The four-quark contribution qq is one order of magnitude smaller. Note that in computing this contribution, the b quark mass has been taken into account. The gluino contribution is shown for different masses. For [formula] it is of the same order as the quark contribution -- the number of flavours is compensated by the enhanced colour factor of the gluino. A non-zero mass has, however, an important effect in suppressing the cross section: the value for [formula] GeV is four times lower than that for [formula] GeV at ycut = 0.01. The conclusion from this Fig. 4 is that a heavier gluino would be very hard to detect, even if one could separate the fermion from the vector boson jets.

Reference [\cite=aleph] describes an attempt by the ALEPH collaboration to measure the QCD colour factors from a sample of 4-jet events. The idea is to fit the theoretical predictions to the data, leaving the colour factors to be determined by the fit. The theoretical expression for the Z  →  qgg contribution, Fig. 1(a-c)), is

[formula]

and for Z  →  qq (Fig. 1d)

[formula]

where yij = m2ij / s denotes the scaled invariant mass squared between a pair of partons and nf is the number of active flavours. The colour factors are determined from the SU(3) generators (Ta)ij and structure constants fabc:

[formula]

The analytical form of the functions [formula] can be found in Ref. [\cite=ert]. In the ALEPH analysis [\cite=aleph], a fit with ycut = 0.03 gives

[formula]

which is in good agreement with the theoretical expectation, for nf  =  5,

[formula]

However, it is important to note that the theoretical expressions in ([\ref=qqgg]) and ([\ref=qqqq]) above are only valid for massless quarks and should be corrected for massive fermions. For example, for ycut = 0.03 and mQ = 5 GeV a Q pair effectively contributes 0.8 relative to a massless pair. When the mass of the b quark is taken into account and the contribution of a light gluino of 5 GeV is included, the value of NC / CF does not change but ([\ref=tf-th]) becomes

[formula]

This result is surprisingly close to the experimental value ([\ref=tf-exp])-([\ref=nc-exp]). A calculation using massless quarks and gluinos would yield 0.375  ×  8 / 5  =  0.6 for this quantity. Obviously, the size of the experimental errors precludes any definitive conclusion at present. All we can say is that the four-jet measurements are consistent with the gluino hypothesis.

Since we have seen in Fig. 4 that the gluino contribution to the total four-jet cross is quite small, it is worth investigating whether shape variables can provide a further discrimination [\cite=farrar]. If we order the jets in the final state according to their energy, it is very likely that the two least energetic jets come from the splitting of the gluon radiated off the quark pair which couple to the Z, Figs. 1,2. The angular correlation between the plane of this soft jet pair and the more energetic primary q pair is different for the qgg and qq final states [\cite=bengtsson]. This can be quantified by using a modified Nachtmann-Reiter angle [formula] [\cite=bengtsson] [\cite=nachtmann], defined as the angle between the vectors (1   -   p3) and (2   -   p4), where the three-momenta are ordered according to the energy of the jet.

The distribution in [formula] for massive fermion jets with Ej  ~  mj is in fact rather different from the massless distribution. The difference is due to the different helicity structure of the matrix element when masses are included [\cite=spinor]. These new helicity structures have the opposite behaviour in [formula] to the massless contributions, and the net effect is that the shape of the distribution resembles more that of the vector boson jets. However, these effects are mainly confined to very small ycut, and are not important for the region of experimental interest, i.e. ycut  >  O(0.01). Fig. 5 shows the [formula] distribution for the various contributions to the four-jet cross section. The two figures correspond to (a) ycut  =  0.01 and (b) ycut  =  0.08. At the lower ycut value, a distinctively different behaviour is observed for the quark/gluino and gluon distributions. On the other hand, the harder cut of ycut  =  0.08 in Fig. 5(b) distorts the phase space so much that the shape of the distributions is virtually indistinguishable, and the differences due to the gluino mass are negligible. Note that in this figure the different contributions are normalised separately. The crossover between the two types of behaviour shown in Fig. 5 occurs at ycut  ~  0.04. A ycut value smaller than this is therefore needed to distinguish the fermion and vector boson contributions.

Using angular distributions of this type, the OPAL collaboration has recently put bounds on the production rate of 4-quark jet events [\cite=opal]. They find an upper limit of 4.7% at 68% confidence level (cl) and of 9.1% at 95% cl on the fraction of 4-jet events of fermion type. The theoretical prediction of QCD is 4.7% , and so that the inclusion of a light gluino would naively enhance this value to 4.7  ×  8 / 5 = 7.5%. However, at ycut = 0.01 (the value used by OPAL) a 5 GeV fermion contributes only 0.51 relative to a massless one. Therefore the production rate with a 5 GeV gluino included is only enhanced to a value of 5.25 % (73% cl). This weakens considerably the strength of the bounds coming from this approach.

Finally, we show in Fig. 6 the theoretical predictions for the [formula] distributions for QCD (quark+gluons) and for QCD+gluino, with ycut  =  0.01 and [formula]. Due to the order of magnitude difference between the quark and gluon contributions (Fig. 4) the differences are rather small. Even with improved statistics, the procedure of Ref. [\cite=opal] will have difficulty in putting stringent bounds on the existence of light gluinos.
