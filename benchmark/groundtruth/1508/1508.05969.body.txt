Temperature dependence of the magnetic hyperfine field at an s-p impurity diluted in RNi2

introduction

The Laves phases intermetallic compounds RNi2 (R = rare earth elements ) crystallize in a cubic structure [\cite=Buschow77] and exhibit an interesting variety of behaviors related to the changes in their magnetic, electronic, and lattice structures. They exhibit magnetization associated both with the localized spins (4f) and with the itinerant electrons of the rare earth. Although the extensive studies made, the theoretical description of how some of their properties varies with temperature, due to the electronic correlations, still remains open. The Ni sublattice however can be disregarded because its [formula] band, being full, is magnetically ineffective. Also the effect of the R 4f electrons is represented by a polarized d band produced by the [formula] electrons magnetic field. This approximation generates an effective rare earth R lattice but whose interactions differ from the usual R pure metal because now the equivalent lattice constant is different (see the end of section [formula] for a numerical indication of the difference between the two cases).

Method

The effective host

We start with a clean effective host described by the Hamiltonian of itinerant d-electrons:

[formula]

The first term of Eq.([\ref=eq6:hamini]) is

[formula]

where ε0σ is the energy of the center of the d band, now depending on the spin polarization; [formula] (djσ) is creation (annihilation) operators, and [formula] is the hopping integrals between atoms from the R effective lattice.

H1d represents the Coulomb interaction

[formula]

nlσ being the number operator.

The partition function Z for the system described by Hamiltonian ([\ref=eq6:hamini]) can be written as

[formula]

where [formula], [formula] is the Boltzman constant and T the temperature. The Hubbard-Stratonovich identity[\cite=HS] was used in order to linearize the Coulomb interaction generating two floating fields, an electric, νl, and a magnetic, ξl. The static approximation has also been performed.

Now, because of the floating fields, the system, although pure, becomes disordered[\cite=IF1] [\cite=IF2]. In Eq.([\ref=Z]) we see that the floating fields create site dependent εl0σ's :

[formula]

We then adopt the Coherent Potential Approximation[\cite=CPA1] [\cite=CPA2] (CPA) point of view in which the system is replaced by an ordered one with an uniform self energy Σσ in all sites l  ≠  l0; in l0 the energy εl0σ remains function of the fluctuation fields with respect to Σσ. The partition function in Eq ([\ref=Z]) is also the partition function for the Hamiltonian below (which will be the one used to implement the CPA)

[formula]

with

[formula]

and

[formula]

In ([\ref=H1cpa]) both l and [formula] are   ≠  l0. Summing over all possible l0 we arrive at the self-consistency condition to determine Σσ:

[formula]

where the probability distribution P, is

[formula]

and Ψ is the free energy associated to H̃0,

[formula]

f(ε) is the Fermi function, z = ε  +  iδ, δ  →  0+, and gl0l0σ(z) is the Green function for the hamiltonian H̃0.

Then, the partition function ([\ref=Z]), in the CPA approach is reduced to

[formula]

The introduction of a s-p impurity

We now describe the effects caused by the introduction of a s-p impurity (say Cd). We add a potential [formula] to Equation [\ref=eq6:hamiti],

[formula]

where the impurity energy [formula] is self consistently determined using the Friedel [\cite=Oliveira2003] condition for the charges screening

[formula]

where ΔZσ is the total charge difference between the σ conduction electrons of the impurity and the host:

[formula]

Using the Dyson equation, the perturbed Green functions for this problem can be written as

[formula]

The local density of states for the σ spin direction is

[formula]

and the local occupation number is

[formula]

So, the magnetic moment at the impurity site is

[formula]

and finally, we calculate the magnetic hyperfine field at the impurity site, assuming that it is proportional to [formula], via the temperature independent [formula] Fermi-Segrè contact coupling parameter [\cite=Campbell69].:

Results and Discussions

We have introduced an effective model to extend our previous zero temperature results [\cite=Oliveira2003] to investigate the magnetic hyperfine fields at a s-p impurity such as Cd, in RNi2 at finite temperatures. We adopt a standard paramagnetic density of state extracted from first principle calculation  [\cite=Yama]. For each RNi2 compound our model has two adjustable parameters, namely ε0σ and U. These are determined by reproducing the zero temperature local magnetic moment and the critical temperature.

In Fig. [\ref=fig:LmCdRNi2] , Fig. [\ref=fig:HmCdRNi2] and Fig. [\ref=fig:cdRNi2] we plot the calculated temperature dependence of the local magnetic moments for the light rare earth elements, for the heavy elements and the magnetic hyperfine fields at Cd as function of temperature.The results are good agreement with the experimental results [\cite=Muller2004].

As stated before, in the effective R lattice the interactions are different from a R pure metal. From Fig. [\ref=fig:HmCdRNi2] we see that the local moment, in units of Bohr magneton μB, at T = 0K is about 0.012 whereas in Ref. [\cite=alekos] it was found that in pure Gd metal it is about 0.05.
