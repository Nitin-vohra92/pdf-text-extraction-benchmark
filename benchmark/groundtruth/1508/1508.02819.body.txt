Introduction

A ternary

[formula]

code is a ternary

[formula]

codes C satisfying the following conditions:

[formula]

for any codeword [formula] (see [\cite=Shimada]). Seven ternary

[formula]

codes.

For ternary

[formula]

codes satisfying the conditions ([\ref=C1])-([\ref=C3]) are SZ-equivalent if one can be obtained from the other by using the following:

[formula]

where [formula] and σ∈S10,τ∈S2 (see [\cite=Shimada]). Here, Sn denotes the symmetric group of degree n.

The main aim of this note is to give the following classification, which is based on a computer calculation.

Any ternary

To complete the above classification, ternary

Characterization of ternary

[formula]

Let C be a ternary

[formula]

code C on {11,12} by Pun(C). Let dmax(n,k) denote the largest minimum weight among ternary

[formula]

code satisfying the condition ([\ref=C2]), then Pun(C) is a ternary

[formula]

code. Again, by the condition ([\ref=C2]), Pun(C) has minimum weight at least 3. Since dmax(10,5) = 5, the result follows.

Let C be a ternary

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=lem:pun], Pun(C) is a ternary

[formula]

Recall that two ternary codes are equivalent if one can be obtained from the other by permuting the coordinates and (if necessary) changing the signs of certain coordinates. For ternary

[formula]

codes satisfying the conditions ([\ref=C1])-([\ref=C3]). Suppose that C and C' are SZ-equivalent. Then Pun(C) and Pun(C') are equivalent.

Suppose that C is obtained from C' by ([\ref=eq:eq]). Then Pun(C) can be obtained from Pun(C') by [formula]

By considering the inverse operation of puncturing, one can construct ternary

[formula]

code and d(C(G))∈{3,4,5}. Let gi denote the ith row of G. Consider the following generator matrix:

[formula]

where

[formula]

We denote this generator matrix by G(a,b), where [formula] and [formula]. The set of the codes C(G(a,b)) contains all ternary

[formula]

code satisfying the conditions ([\ref=C1])-([\ref=C3]) can be obtained from some ternary

[formula]

codes, then the sets of all codes C(G(a,b)) satisfying the conditions ([\ref=C1])-([\ref=C3]) is obtained from the set of all codes C(G'(a,b)) satisfying the same conditions by considering ([\ref=eq:eq]) with β = 0 and τ is the identity permutation. Hence, it is sufficient to consider only inequivalent ternary

[formula]

codes satisfying the conditions ([\ref=C1])-([\ref=C3]). This is a reason why we consider the classification of ternary

[formula]

Ternary

[formula]

There is a unique ternary

[formula]

codes with d∈{3,4}, which is based on a computer calculation.

We describe how ternary

[formula]

codes were classified. Let C be a ternary

[formula]

code). We may assume without loss of generality that C has generator matrix of the following form:

[formula]

where A is a 5  ×  5 matrix over [formula] and I5 denotes the identity matrix of order 5. Thus, we only need consider the set of A, rather than the set of generator matrices. The set of matrices A was constructed, row by row, as follows, by a computer calculation. Let ri be the ith row of A. Then, we may assume without loss of generality that r1 = (0,0,0,1,1) (resp. r1 = (0,0,1,1,1)), by permuting and (if necessary) changing the signs of the columns of A.

Let [formula] denote the vectors [formula], respectively. We denote the ternary code generated by vectors [formula] by [formula]. For [formula], consider the following conditions:

the first nonzero element of x is 1,

[formula] (resp. [formula]),

the ternary code 〈(e1,r1),(e2,x)〉 has minimum weight 3 (resp. 4),

x1  ≤  x2  ≤  x3  ≤  1 and x4  ≤  x5 (resp.  x1  ≤  x2  ≤  1 and x3  ≤  x4  ≤  x5), where we consider a natural order on the elements of [formula] by 0 < 1 < 2.

The determination of the minimum weights was done by a computer calculation for all codes in this note. Let X1 be the set of vectors [formula] satisfying the first three conditions. Let X2 be the set of vectors x∈X1 satisfying the fourth condition. Our computer calculation shows that (  #  X1,  #  X2)  =  (115,18) (resp. (88,14)). Define a lexicographical order on X1 induced by the above order of [formula], that is, [formula] if a1  <  b1, or [formula] and ak + 1 < bk + 1 for some k∈{1,2,3,4}. The matrices A were constructed, row by row, satisfying the following conditions:

the ternary code 〈(es,rs)|s = 1,2,3〉 has minimum weight 3 (resp. 4), where r2∈X2, r3∈X1,

the ternary code 〈(es,rs)|s = 1,2,3,4〉 has minimum weight 3 (resp. 4), where r2∈X2, r3,r4∈X1 (r3  <  r4),

the ternary code 〈(es,rs)|s = 1,2,3,4,5〉 has minimum weight 3 (resp. 4), where r2∈X2, r3,r4,r5∈X1 (r3 < r4 < r5).

It is obvious that the set of the matrices A which must be checked to achieve a complete classification, can be obtained in this way.

Then, by a computer calculation, we found 4328352 (resp. 650051) matrices A. Our computer calculation shows the 4328352 ternary

[formula]

codes) are divided into 527 (resp. 64) classes by comparing their Hamming weight enumerators. For each Hamming weight enumerator, to test equivalence of codes, we use the algorithm given in [\cite=KO] as follows. For a ternary

[formula]

codes C and C' are equivalent if and only if Γ(C) and Γ(C') are isomorphic. We use the package GRAPE [\cite=GRAPE] of GAP [\cite=GAP4] for digraph isomorphism testing. After checking whether codes are equivalent or not by a computer calculation for each Hamming weight enumerator, we have the following:

There are 135 ternary

[formula]

codes, up to equivalence.

We denote the 135 ternary

[formula]

codes by C10,3,i [formula]. Generator matrices of all codes can be obtained electronically from [\cite=Araya].

The unique ternary

[formula]

codes and 242 ternary

Ternary

[formula]

In this section, we give a classification of ternary

[formula]

codes with d∈{3,4,5}, by using the method given in Section [\ref=Sec:pre].

From the

[formula]

codes

As described in the previous section, there is a unique ternary

[formula]

codes C satisfying the conditions ([\ref=C1]) and Pun(C) = C10,5, we consider generator matrices G10,5(a,b) of the form ([\ref=eq:gmat]). Since the weight of each row of G10,5 is 5, (ai,bi) = (1,2) or (2,1) for i = 1,2,3,4,5. By ([\ref=eq:eq]), we may assume that (a1,b1) = (1,2). Since the weight of the sum of the first row and the second row of G10,5 is 5, (a2,b2) must be (1,2). Similarly, we have that (ai,bi) = (1,2) for i = 3,4,5, since A is circulant. In addition, we verified by a computer calculation that this code satisfies the condition ([\ref=C1]). Note that the code automatically satisfies the conditions ([\ref=C2]) and ([\ref=C3]). We denote the code by C12,1.

Now, consider the ternary

[formula]

codes C satisfying the conditions ([\ref=C1]) and Pun(C) = C10,4,i. This was done by a computer calculation. We denote by G10,4,i the generator matrix [formula] of C10,4,i for each i. Since the weight of the first row of A is 3 (see Section [\ref=sec:10]), by ([\ref=eq:eq]), we may assume that (a1,b1) = (1,1) in ([\ref=eq:gmat]). Under this situation, we verified by a computer calculation that only the codes C10,4,60 and C10,4,132 give ternary

[formula]

codes C satisfying the conditions ([\ref=C1])-([\ref=C3]) and the condition that Pun(C) is a ternary

[formula]

codes satisfying the conditions ([\ref=C1])-([\ref=C3]). Hence, we have the following:

Up to SZ-equivalence, there are three ternary

[formula]

From the

[formula]

By considering generator matrices of the form ([\ref=eq:gmat]), we found all ternary

[formula]

codes satisfying the condition ([\ref=C1]) for

[formula]

In this case, there are codes satisfying the condition ([\ref=C1]), but not ([\ref=C3]). We verified by a computer calculation that only the codes C10,3,i give ternary

[formula]

codes satisfying the conditions ([\ref=C1])-([\ref=C3]) and the condition that Pun(C) is a ternary

[formula]

codes satisfying the conditions ([\ref=C1])-([\ref=C3]). Hence, we have the following:

Up to SZ-equivalence, there are four ternary

[formula]

Up to SZ-equivalence, seven ternary

[formula]

codes satisfying the conditions ([\ref=C1])-([\ref=C3]). Therefore, we have Theorem [\ref=thm].

Some properties

For the ternary

[formula]

codes satisfying the condition that all codewords have weight divisible by three, in the proof of Theorem 1.4 (see [\cite=Shimada]). We point out that a code satisfying the condition is self-orthogonal. There is a unique self-orthogonal ternary
