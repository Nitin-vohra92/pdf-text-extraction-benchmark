Analytical solution of the Schrödinger equation for the hydrogen molecular ion H+2

The hydrogen molecular ion H+2 is a very important case of the quantum tree-body problem with the Coulomb interaction. It is well known that the variables of the Schrödinger equation for the H+2 molecular ion in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation are separated in elliptic coordinates η = (r1 - r2) / R, ξ = (r1 + r2) / R, where R is the internuclear distance and r1, r2 are distances between the electron and nuclei 1 and 2, correspondingly [\cite=Burrau_1927]. In this case, the wave function for the Σ ground state can be presented as

[formula]

where the functions X(ξ,R) and Y(η,R) satisfy the following equations:

[formula]

[formula]

where E and A are energy and separation constant which have to be determined. Equation ([\ref=lable_02]) is most important among these two equations because its solution is mainly defined the property of the molecular wave function along the internuclear axis.

An analytic solution for the Eq. ([\ref=lable_01]) was given in [\cite=Jaffe_1934], while an analytic solution of Eq. ([\ref=lable_02]) was unknown up to present study. However, its solution can be obtained by noting that [formula] when η  →  0. Then, the two linear independent solutions of this equation can be obtained by substituting two anzatz functions into it

[formula]

where g1(η) and g2(η) are new functions. This gives us two equations for g1(η) and g2(η)

[formula]

[formula]

Their polynomial solutions can be found by applying the usual method used for the H+2 problem [\cite=MorseStueckelberg_1929] [\cite=Teller_1930].

The first most important question is algebraic structure of the general solution of differential Eq. ([\ref=lable_02]). It is written as the linear combination of two linear independent solutions Y1 and Y2:

[formula]

This solution is symmetric with respect to the sign change of η. Therefore, it can be rewritten in the form

[formula]

which explicitly displays physical meaning of both terms. The first term in ([\ref=lable_03]) can be interpreted as the molecular wave function of cylindrical symmetry, because in interval
