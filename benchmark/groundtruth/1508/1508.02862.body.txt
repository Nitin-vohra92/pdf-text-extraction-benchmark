On the Gromov width of homogeneous KÄHLER manifolds

Introduction

The Gromov width [\cite=GROMOV85] of a 2n-dimensional symplectic manifold (M,ω) is defined as

[formula]

where

[formula]

is the open ball of radius r endowed with the standard symplectic form [formula] of [formula]. By Darboux's theorem cG(M,ω) is a positive number. Computations and estimates of the Gromov width for various examples have been obtained by several authors (see, e.g. [\cite=lmz2] and references therein). The main result of this paper is the following theorem proved in the next section.

The class of manifolds in Theorem [\ref=mainnew] includes all Hermitian symmetric space of compact type whose Gromov width has been computed in [\cite=lmz1]. We do not know if the assumption on the second Betti number can be dropped.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=mainnew]

The proof of Theorem [\ref=mainnew] is mainly based on the lower bound recently obtained by K. Kaveh [\cite=kk]:

Theorem A Let X be a smooth complex projective variety embedded in a complex projective space [formula]. Then

[formula]

where ωFS denotes the restriction to X of the Fubini-Study Kähler form of [formula].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=mainnew] The upper bound cG(M,ω)  ≤  π is Theorem 1 in [\cite=lmz2]. In order to obtain the lower bound cG(M,ω)  ≥  π, consider the integral Kähler form [formula] on M. Let (L,h) be the holomorphic hermitian line bundle on M such that [formula], where [formula] is the 2-form on M defined by [formula], for a local trivializing holomorphic section σ of L. Let [formula] be an orthonormal basis for the space of global holomorphic sections H0(L) of L equipped with the L2-scalar product 〈  ·  ,  ·  〉 given by:

[formula]

Then, it is not hard to see (see, e.g. [\cite=arezzoloi]), due to the homogeneity and simply connectedness of M, that the Kodaira map [formula] is a Kähler immersion, i.e. k*ωFS  =  . Moreover, in [\cite=asian] is proved that such a map is injective, and hence (M,) is symplectomorphic to (k(M),ωFS). By Theorem A and by the conformality of the Gromov width one gets

[formula]

and the theorem is proved. [formula]
