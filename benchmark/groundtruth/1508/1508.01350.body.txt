Kolmogorov's axioms for probabilities with values in hyperbolic numbers

Introduction

The hyperbolic numbers (called also split-complex, or perplex, or double numbers, etc.) are known since long ago but they are not as popular as complex numbers or quaternions. At the same time they possess many interesting properties; in particular, the ring [formula] of hyperbolic numbers admits a partial order [formula] which has a good compatibility with the other algebraic structures of [formula]. Consider the inequality [formula]; it turns out that it has a well-defined set of solutions in [formula] and one can think of them as of the probabilities of some random events.

This was a motivation of the present work: to test how this conjecture operates. First of all, we give a review of hyperbolic numbers making a special emphasize on the properties of non-negative hyperbolic numbers. Next, we introduce direct generalizations of Kolmogorov's axioms where a probabilistic measure takes values in hyperbolic numbers. It is followed by a series of the immediate properties of such probabilistic measures. The last Section 5 "Conditional probability" introduces this notion, including the case of probabilities which are zero-divisors in [formula], and presents the hyperbolic generalizations of several classic facts: multiplication theorem, independence of random events, law of total probability, Bayes' theorem.

Altogether, we have shown that the basic facts (elementary but underlying) of the classic probability theory extend onto the situation under consideration. Thus one can expect that the whole building can be constructed as well.

Our approach can be seen in different ways. First of all, since we replace the range [formula] of probabilistic measures by a hypercomplex system [formula] then the approach can be interpreted as an attempt to consider probabilistic measures with non-numerical (in the sense of non-real) values. The most renowned research line in this direction is that of quantum probability but the two are rather distant from each other, see, e.g., [\cite=Accardi], [\cite=Parth], [\cite=Meyer].

On the other hand, the hyperbolic numbers can be seen as a real two-dimensional algebra with the underlying linear space [formula]. Hence, the hyperbolic probability has the following interpretation: one deals with a stochastic experiment which generates the necessity to endow the σ-algebra of the events with two probabilistic measures which are seen as [formula]-valued measures; what is more, a rich multiplicative structure is introduced on the range of such measures.

Such situations may emerge in mathematical statistics in testing composite hypotheses.

Another example is provided by thermodynamics and statistical physics. Consider a physical system which has two (or more) minima of free energy. If the system is in an equilibrium then it can be in any of these states with certain probabilities but it cannot be known for sure in which of them; this is exactly the situation we are interested in.

We believe that our approach will be useful in treating such situations although in the present work we limit ourselves with considering the basics of purely mathematical theory.

A review of hyperbolic numbers

Information about hyperbolic numbers is dispersed in many sources. We concentrate in this section some basic facts which can be found in more details in [\cite=uno], [\cite=cinco].

The ring of hyperbolic numbers is the commutative ring [formula] defined as

[formula]

There is a conjugation, the [formula]-conjugation, on hyperbolic numbers:

[formula]

This [formula]-conjugation is an additive, involutive and multiplicative operation on [formula]:

[formula];

[formula];

[formula].

Note that given [formula], then

[formula]

from which it follows that any hyperbolic number [formula] with [formula] is invertible, and its inverse is given by

[formula]

If, on the other hand, [formula] but [formula] then [formula] is a zero-divisor. In fact there are no other zero-divisors. We denote the set of zero-divisors by [formula], thus

[formula]

It turns out that there are two very special zero-divisors in [formula]. Set

[formula]

then its [formula]-conjugate is

[formula]

It is immediate to check that [formula] and [formula] are zero-divisors, and they are mutually complementary idempotent elements. Thus, the two sets

[formula]

are (principal) ideals in the ring [formula] and they have the properties:

[formula]

and

[formula]

Formula ([\ref=unouno]) is called the idempotent decomposition of [formula]. Every hyperbolic number [formula] can be written as

[formula]

Formula ([\ref=unodos]) is called the idempotent representation of a hyperbolic number. It has a remarkable feature: the algebraic operations of addition, multiplication, taking of inverse, etc. can be realized component-wise.

Observe that the sets [formula] and [formula] can be written as

[formula]

It will be useful to have in mind the following properties:

[formula] if and only if [formula];

[formula] if and only if [formula].

The set of non-negative hyperbolic numbers is

[formula]

We will need two more sets:

[formula]

Let us now define on [formula] the next relation: given [formula] we write [formula] whenever [formula]; this relation is reflexive, transitive and antisymmetric and therefore it defines a partial order on [formula]. Also, if we take [formula] then [formula] if and only if α  ≤  β, thus [formula] is an extension of the total order ≤   on [formula].

The next properties of the order [formula] will be useful in subsequent computations (for more details see [\cite=uno]). Let [formula]

If [formula] and [formula], then [formula]

If [formula] and [formula], then [formula].

If [formula], then [formula].

Thanks to the good properties of the partial order [formula], one defines the hyperbolic-valued modulus on [formula] by

[formula]

where |ν1|, |ν2| denote the usual modulus of real numbers. The subindex [formula] is used to emphasize that this modulus is linked to the hyperbolic numbers with the imaginary unit [formula]. Moreover, the name "hyperbolic-valued modulus" for ([\ref=def_hyp_norm]) is justified by the following properties (see [\cite=uno], [\cite=cinco]):

[formula] if and only if [formula].

[formula].

[formula] for any [formula], [formula].

In particular, one may talk about the supremum [formula] of bounded sets in [formula] with respect to this hyperbolic-valued modulus. Indeed, let [formula], if there exists [formula] such that [formula] for any x∈A, we say that A is a [formula]-bounded set. Introduce

[formula]

if A is a [formula]-bounded set then A1 and A2 are bounded, and the [formula] can be computed as

[formula]

It is worth noting that some hyperbolic modules can be endowed with a hyperbolic-valued norm. These norms have the expected properties, that is, if a hyperbolic module W has a hyperbolic-valued norm [formula], then the latte satisfies:

[formula] for all x∈W and [formula] if and only if x = 0∈W.

[formula] for all [formula] and for all x∈W.

[formula] for all x,  w∈W.

The strength of hyperbolic-valued norms defined on hyperbolic modules has been exploited in [\cite=uno] and [\cite=ocho]. In the latter a version of Hahn-Banach Theorem for hyperbolic modules has been proved.

[formula]-valued probability

Every [formula]-valued probabilistic measure can be written as

[formula]

with P1(A)  =  p1(A) + p2(A);  P2(A) = p1(A) - p2(A). The property ( i) of [formula] implies that

[formula]

The property ( ii) gives:

[formula]

that is:

If [formula] then P1(Ω) = 1, P2(Ω) = 1.

If [formula] then P1(Ω) = 1, P2(Ω) = 0.

If [formula] then P1(Ω) = 0, P2(Ω) = 1.

The property ( iii) leads to

[formula]

Hence, to define a [formula]-valued probabilistic measure is equivalent to consider, on the same measurable space, a pair of unrelated, in general, usual [formula]-valued measures. In the case (1) both P1 and P2 are probabilistic measures; in case (2) P1 is a probabilistic measure and P2 is a trivial one; in case (3) P1 is a trivial measure and P2 is a probabilistic measure. The cases (2) and (3) can be seen as two options of embedding the classic real-valued probabilistic measures into our new concept of [formula]-valued probabilistic measures: we identify such real-valued measures with [formula]-probabilistic measures which takes as its values only zero-divisors.

Properties of [formula]-valued probabilistic measures

Given A∈Σ, then [formula] where AC∈Σ is the complement of A.

[formula], [formula], hence

[formula]

[formula].

[formula].

If A,  B∈Σ with A  ⊂  B then [formula] and [formula] are comparable with respect to the partial order [formula], what is more,

[formula]

[formula]

where [formula]. Hence [formula], and since [formula] we can add [formula] to both sides, proving with this the statement.

Indeed, it is always true that given A∈Σ, A  ⊆  Ω, hence [formula] is comparable with [formula]; what is more, [formula].

The addition theorem. Given a collection of events [formula], there holds:

[formula]

By induction. For n = 2 since [formula] and also [formula], then

[formula]

Given two events A and B, [formula] is comparable with [formula] and

[formula]

More generally, given events [formula] there follows:

[formula]

Theorem of continuity of the [formula]-probability.

If [formula] and [formula] then

[formula]

[formula]

and the summands are pairwise disjoint, hence

[formula]

The series here converges for any n, in particular, for n = 1, hence

[formula]

thus, the following sums go to zero:

[formula]

Finally, [formula]

Note that the convergence here is considered with respect to the hyperbolic-valued modulus [formula], see again [\cite=uno] for the details.

Take Bn: = ACn and use property (VI).

Conditional probability

Let us show that items (3) and (4) are in a complete agreement with (1). Indeed, using ([\ref=cartesian_and_idempotent_representation]) write for any event A: [formula]. Hence, item (1) in idempotent representation reads:

[formula]

meanwhile items (3) and (4) read:

[formula]

and

[formula]

Thus, we see a complete compatibility of the formula in item (1) and of its analogues in items (3) and (4).

Let us show that for a fixed B, with [formula], the conditional probability verifies all the axioms of the [formula]-probability, that is, it defines a new [formula]-probabilistic measure on the measurable space (B,ΣB) where ΣB is the σ-algebra of the sets of the form [formula] with A∈Σ.

Indeed, clearly [formula]. Next, let's see that [formula]. Indeed:

If [formula], then

[formula]

If [formula], then

[formula]

If [formula], then

[formula]

Finally, if [formula] with [formula] for [formula] then:

If [formula], then

[formula]

If [formula], since [formula] for any k and since [formula], write [formula] and

[formula]

hence:

[formula]

Similarly if [formula].

Hence, [formula] is a new probabilistic space.

It is necessary to consider the different cases that arise.

If [formula] and [formula], then we know that

[formula]

hence ([\ref=mult_formula]) follows.

If [formula], since [formula] then [formula] implying ([\ref=mult_formula]).

If [formula] with λ1 > 0 then

[formula]

hence

[formula]

Since [formula], then

[formula]

Rewriting ([\ref=mult2ast]) one gets:

[formula]

If [formula] with λ2 > 0, one proceeds as in (c).

This theorem has a generalization for n random events.

Assume that (1) occurs. Since

[formula]

the hypothesis [formula] is equivalent to say that [formula] and [formula], and it implies that [formula] for all [formula] and also that [formula] is a strictly positive hyperbolic number (that is positive and not zero-divisor) for all [formula] and thus all conditional probabilities of the form [formula] for [formula] are well-defined, implying that

[formula]

hence ([\ref=form_theor_mult]) follows.

Assuming now that (2) occurs, the hypothesis that [formula] is a positive zero-divisor, let's say [formula], μ > 0, implies that [formula].

On the other hand, assume that k0 is the minimum integer in [formula] such that [formula] is a zero-divisor. This implies that [formula] for all k  ≥  k0; writing in this case [formula], one has:

[formula]

We have also that

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

The case (3) is proved analogously.

Let us analyze all possible situations.

Assume that [formula]. By definition, in this case [formula] and [formula], thus A and B are mutually independent. Moreover, it is enough to assume that one of the two probabilities only, say [formula], equals zero. Indeed, if [formula] then [formula] and hence

[formula]

i.e., A and B are mutually independent. And in any case there follows [formula].

Assume that both [formula] and [formula] are not in [formula]. That A is independent of B is equivalent to

[formula]

which, in turn, is equivalent to

[formula]

In the same way, if B is independent of A then this is equivalent to

[formula]

i.e.,

[formula]

Finally, under the assumed hypotheses A is independent of B if and only if B is independent of A if and only if A and B are mutually independent.

Assume that [formula] and [formula] are zero-divisors which both belong to [formula]: [formula] and [formula] with positive reals λ and μ. This means that P1(A) = λ and P1(B)  =  μ meanwhile P2(A) = P2(B) = 0 implying that [formula] and [formula] (hence [formula]). Suppose that A is independent of B; this is equivalent to

[formula]

thus A is independent of B if and only if

[formula]

Assume the equality [formula] holds. Considering now [formula] we have:

[formula]

which means that B is independent of A, and thus A and B are mutually independent. Observe that using ([\ref=probAyBzero_div_e]) or ([\ref=probAyBzero_div_e-2]) one concludes that for independent A and B

[formula]

In the same way the case of [formula] and [formula] being both in [formula] is covered.

Assume that [formula] and [formula] are zero-divisors but now such that [formula] and [formula] or vice-versa. This gives, in particular, that since [formula] and [formula] then

[formula]

that is [formula]. Consider [formula], one has:

[formula]

which means that the hypotheses imply that A is independent of B. But

[formula]

that is, B is independent of A.

Somewhat paradoxically, in this case A and B are always mutually independent. And there follows that

[formula]

The last case assumes that [formula] is zero-divisor and [formula] is an invertible hyperbolic number or vice-versa. Set

[formula]

In particular, this implies that

[formula]

That A is independent of B is equivalent to

[formula]

i.e., [formula].

On the other hand,

[formula]

i.e., B is independent of A. Of course, the reasoning is reversible, thus A and B are mutually independent if and only if one of them is independent of the another one.

Finally note that from the above one has for independent events that ν  =  λμ1, hence:

[formula]

Resuming the just made analysis , one has the following

Given two random events A and B, then A is independent of B if and only if B is independent of A.

If A and B are mutually independent events then the multiplication theorem becomes

[formula]

It is enough to prove for A and BC. Write [formula] with disjoint summands. Then [formula] from where

[formula]

Of course, we can factorize [formula] but the consequent computation depends on the value of [formula]. Thus we have to consider the following cases:

[formula], then [formula] and in this case [formula]. Hence

[formula]

thus A and BC are mutually independent.

If [formula], let us say, [formula], since [formula], then [formula] for some ν  ≥  0; write [formula], and one has two more subcases:

If [formula], then [formula] and there follows:

[formula]

thus, A and BC are mutually independent.

If [formula] (note that the equality [formula] is impossible) then necessarily [formula] and [formula], hence

[formula]

and A and BC are mutually independent.

The case [formula] is treated similarly.

If [formula] are mutually independent events then the general multiplication theorem holds in a simplified form:

[formula]

Since [formula] and the events [formula] are pairwise disjoint then

[formula]

It is enough to apply now Theorem [\ref=mult_theorem] ("Multiplication Theorem").

Let [formula] be an invertible hyperbolic number then the multiplication theorem gives:

[formula]

Thus, a part of formula ([\ref=estrella]) verifies. Using the hyperbolic law of total probability gives the rest of ([\ref=estrella]).

Let [formula] with λ being a positive real number then the multiplication theorem leads to the equality:

[formula]

Note that the left-hand side of ([\ref=ultima]) is an element of [formula], hence the right-hand side must be an element of [formula] also. But this is true indeed, since in the definition of [formula] the factor [formula] is involved and because [formula], hence [formula]. Now, recalling the property of Remark [\ref=useful_property], equation ([\ref=ultima]) can be rewritten as

[formula]

finally using the hyperbolic law of total probability one obtains ([\ref=dos-estrellas]).

We proceed similarly to item 2).
