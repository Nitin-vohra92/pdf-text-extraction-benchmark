Conformal Triality of the Kepler problem

Introduction

The Kepler problem can be rightly considered as a 'golden classic' in Hamiltonian dynamics for a host of reasons. It is sufficiently realistic to describe within appropriate limits the dynamics of planets in the Solar System, and to some extent classical scattering of pointlike electric charges, while at the same time it is important in the theory of integrable systems, being superintegrable and with a large dynamical symmetry group. It can be taught at a simple level in an undergraduate physics course of mechanics, as well as in a Quantum Mechanics course since integrability holds in the quantum theory too. At the same time a very extensive bibliography and books have been written on the subject and its generalisations, see [\cite=Cordani2003kepler] and related works. The literature on the subject being fairly vast, we do not try in this brief letter to cover it in a complete way but rather we try to point out the papers that are most relevant to the line of thought pursued here, and refer the reader to their bibliography to supplement what is missing.

An important moment in the history of the problem comes with the modern, geometrical approach that can be attributed to Fock and then Bargmann [\cite=Fock1935] [\cite=Bargmann1936], who analysed the quantum mechanical Kepler problem, and showed that the SO(4) symmetry of negative energy states is explained by mapping the Kepler problem with a fixed energy to that of a free particle on a 3 - sphere embedded in 4 - dimensional space. The classical description has been discussed and then generalised by Moser and Belbruno. The former showed that the hypersurface of a given negative energy in phase space is homeomorphic to the unit tangent bundle of the sphere S3 with the north pole excluded, the result being generalisable to general dimension n[\cite=moser1970regularization]. Belbruno added the cases of positive energy, in correspondence to the three-hyperboloid H3, and zero energy which corresponds to 3-dimensional Euclidean space [\cite=belbruno1977two].

It is well known that, at the level of the allowed shapes of trajectories of the Kepler problem, ellipses, parabolae and hyperbolae are all related by projective transformations. Thus the question arises if it is possible to find a projective relation between different energy trajectories in the whole phase space. Recent work in the direction of relating geometrically trajectories of different energies has been done by Barrett, Keane and Simmons [\cite=KBS2000], who showed that the Kepler system is related, for all values of the energy at the same time, to geodesic motion on 3-spaces of constant curvature k via canonical transformations and reparameterisation of trajectories. The relation introduced between the Kepler problem and the geodesic motion on constant curvature manifolds reminds somehow of coupling constant metamorphosis [\cite=Hietarinta1984coupling]. The two systems described are considered by the authors to be related but different, their Hamiltonians not being the same. Depending on whether k is positive, zero or negative one obtains geometrically the different dynamical symmetry algebras so(4), iso(3) and so(3,1) of the Kepler problem. In [\cite=KB2000] 4-dimensional Einstein static spacetimes are studied, which are foliated by the constant curvature 3-spaces mentioned above. These spaces are conformally flat and their conformal group is SO(4,2). Coordinates are found that put the metrics in a manifestly conformally flat form and the Lie algebra of conformal Killing vectors is studied. Null geodesic motion in these space is special since admits the maximum number of conserved charges that are linear in the momenta: they are generated by all the conformal Killing vectors. Keane [\cite=Keane2002] generalised the constructions and described in detail the zero energy case and time dependent conserved quantities.

The current work is motived from the desire to give a geometrical interpretation of the full dynamical group SO(4,2) of symmetries of the Kepler problem. An important role in discovering the nature of the above interpretation is played by projective transformations in phase space: as will be seen in the following section, these allow a simple and elegant reformulation of the classical Kepler problem in terms of null geodesics on a conformally flat Weyl space where the dynamical symmetry for all energies is manifest, thus displaying the strength of the technique used and completing the geometrisation of the system. Different conformal classes are projectively related, and in fact one is dealing with null geodesics on the space that realises the conformal triality of Mink, dS and AdS spaces [\cite=Penrose1974] [\cite=Cordani2003kepler] [\cite=zhou2005conformal]. In many respects we follow a parallel line to that of Kean, Barrett and Simmons, the main difference being that we use projective geometry to show the dual systems of Kepler and geodesic motion are projectively the same, and that the end result is null dynamics in a 4 - dimensional Weyl space that includes at the same time all the values of the curvature: this is the conformal compactification of Minkowski space and as shown it is related to the null lift of Kepler's problem in phase space. In particular, trajectories with different energy sign can be mapped one into the other via a projective transformation. Previous treatments only considered the action of SO(2,4) on standard Kepler trajectories, which does not change the sign of the energy. We also show how to embed trajectories of the original Kepler problem in the space [formula] which is used to describe the conformal compactification of Minkowski space, realising geometrically the action of SO(2,4) on the projective trajectories.

Main result

The Hamiltonian of the Kepler problem is

[formula]

where {qi,pj} are conjugate variables, i,j = 1,2,3, [formula] and for simplicity in this work we exclude the configuration space point q  =  0. α  >  0 is a constant. We consider the following null lift of the Hamiltonian:

[formula]

where we have added new conjugate variables {y,py},{a,pa}, {b,pb}, the momenta being conserved. This is a null Hamiltonian that projects to the original one if we impose H  =  0, p2y  =  α, and then p2a  =  E, pb  =  0 for positive energy solutions of [\eqref=eq:H], pa  =  0, p2b  =    -  E for negative energy solutions, and pa  =  0, pb  =  0 for zero energy solutions. For reasons that will become clear in a few moments, we choose to work in the open phase space region py  >  0. We can exclude py  =  0 since its associated geodesics are related to free motion as it can be seen from [\eqref=eq:null_first].

In [\cite=KBS2000] the following dual Hamiltonian is considered

[formula]

which can be canonically transformed into a geodesic Hamiltonian. As the authors note, G above can be formally obtained by solving for α in [\eqref=eq:H], taking its square, setting - E  =  k, and promoting the result to a phase space function. This is quite similar to what happens in coupling constant metamorphosis [\cite=Hietarinta1984coupling], with the exception of the procedure of taking the square which is novel.

We now relate [\eqref=eq:H] and [\eqref=eq:G] projectively in phase space. As we have shown in a recent companion work [\cite=MarcoProjective2015] any null geodesic Hamiltonian of the form [formula], as is H above, defines a projective conic in tangent space, and any two lower dimensional systems whose null lifts are related one to the other by a projective transformation are dual. In particular, one can rescale the metric gAB using a phase space factor Ω2(q,p)  ≠  0 and obtain a new Hamiltonian

[formula]

If [formula] generates evolution of trajectories associated to a parameter λ̄, and H to λ, then then the equations of motion for the variables (q,p) given by [formula] are mapped back to the original equations of motion of H after one makes the following change of parameter on one trajectory at a time

[formula]

the result being valid for null geodesics only. We refer the reader to [\cite=MarcoProjective2015] for details.

In the present situation we will perform two such reparameterisations. First choose the phase space factor to be Ω- 2  =  q: we change parameter [formula] with

[formula]

which transforms H into

[formula]

This reparameterisation is valid only for trajectories that have q  ≠  0, so we are implicitly excluding collision trajectories. The same change of parameter appears in [\cite=KBS2000], as well as other previous works in the literature, but not in the sense of acting on a null lift.

We now perform a non-trivial, phase space dependent rescaling of [formula] times the factor [formula]: this gives a new Hamiltonian

[formula]

where

[formula]

The reader can notice that this is a null lift of [\eqref=eq:G] upon identifying k  =    -  E. The rescaling factor is never zero since from the condition [formula] we get [formula]. Now we perform the following canonical transformation:

[formula]

which is defined in the open region Py  >  0. This has the effect of replacing the p4y term in [\eqref=eq:Hbar] with 2P2y. Next, we perform the canonical transformation of [\cite=KBS2000]:

[formula]

complemented by A  =  pa, PA  =    -  a, B  =  pb, PB  =    -  B. This transforms the Hamiltonian [formula] into

[formula]

where A2  -  B2  =  E. This null Hamiltonian can be interpreted in two ways. On one hand it is the null lift associated to positive energy geodesic motion on a 3-dimensional Riemannian manifold that is conformally flat, of constant curvature k  =    -  E, written in stereographic coordinates, as noticed in [\cite=KBS2000]. There the authors state that the geodesic motion Hamiltonian and the Kepler problem Hamiltonian [\eqref=eq:H] are related but different Hamiltonians, however in our null projective approach we have just shown that they are obtained from the same projective null Hamiltonian and therefore represent the same dynamics. On the other hand, the null Hamiltonian [\eqref=eq:null_H_final] describes null geodesics on an Einstein static spacetime that is conformally Minkowskian, as discussed in [\cite=Keane2002] [\cite=KB2000]. Thus the present approach encompasses both types of discussions. We also notice that in our framework what matters is not the specific metric but its Weyl class. The Weyl space we have found is the conformally flat 4-dimensional space that hosts the conformal triality of Minkowski, de Sitter and anti-de Sitter spaces [\cite=zhou2005conformal], that will be discussed in more detail in the next section.

We now briefly discuss conserved quantities. Suppose that C(q,p) is a conserved quantity for a null geodesic Hamiltonian H, {C,H}  =  0 where {  ·  ,  ·  } is the Poisson bracket. It is clear that, in our projective approach, C will also be conserved for a rescaled Hamiltonian   =  Ω- 2(q,p)H, using the on-shell condition H  =  0. From this we can infer that conserved quantities for the null Hamiltonians [\eqref=eq:null_first], [\eqref=eq:null_H_final] can be obtained from those of flat Minkowski space. In particular, the conformal group SO(2,4) of flat Minkowski space acts as a symmetry algebra for [formula]. The explicit change of variables that conformally maps the Einstein static metric of [\eqref=eq:null_H_final] into Minkowski space can be found in [\cite=KB2000]. In the next section we will see how the action of SO(2,4) on the projective curves described in this section can be described geometrically by mapping these curves into curves in a projective cone in a six-dimensional ambient space.

Conformal triality

We are dealing with a Weyl 4-dimensional space that includes Mink, dS and AdS spaces. The fact that these are conformally related, together with the fact that the Lie algebra of the Kepler problem is so(2,4) have a profound common origin. It is known in fact that the conformal group of 4-dimensional Minkowski space is locally isomorphic to O(2,4), and to our knowledge the first discussion of the origin of these results is due to [\cite=Penrose1974]. Similar arguments have been discussed among others by [\cite=Cordani2003kepler] [\cite=zhou2005conformal], and in particular we will refer to the former for a detailed discussion. We remind the reader of the original arguments and then show how they apply to the present problem. One can consider [formula] with coordinates (T,V,W,X1,X2,X3) and Lorentzian metric [formula]. The null cone N given by points that satisfy

[formula]

is left invariant by the action of O(2,4). If we consider the intersection of N with the null hyperplane V - W = 1 then we can use (T,X1,X2,X3) as coordinates, and the induced metric on the intersection is

[formula]

Thus we can identify the intersection with 4-dimensional Minkwowski space, Mink4. Now consider the set

[formula]

that can represented by coordinates with V  ≠  W will intersect the hyperplane V - W = 1 in a unique point, and can be put in a one to one correspondence with a point in Mink4. However, there are also elements of

[formula]

can be thought of as Mink4 with its points at infinity added. We notice that points on N can be described by the coordinates

[formula]

where [formula], i = 1,2,3, and Vα satisfies VαVα  =  1, and thus is a vector on S3 parameterised by coordinates θi. From this we see that (y,θi) can be taken as local coordinates for

[formula]

, we can consider a set of representative points on N by taking a (local) cross-section of N given by points of the type [\eqref=eq:N_coordinates] with r  =  r(y,θi). Then we can consider the induced metric on the cross section, which is given by

[formula]

i.e. it is conformal to a Robertson-Walker spacetime with constant positive curvature on the equal time slices, using the same variables (y,θi) defined above. Since such space is conformally flat, this includes the Minkowski space described earlier. Then

[formula]

that is independent on the cross-section used. We now want to define a more precise correspondence between the null geodesics of [\eqref=eq:null_H_final] and curves on

[formula]

, in the sense of zero acceleration curves, by asking that the second derivative of [\eqref=eq:curve] has zero components along [formula] and [formula]: in other words, the acceleration can only have a component along the vector P itself. Then one finds the following equation for xμ  =  (y,θi)

[formula]

where Γμρσ are the Christoffel symbols of the induced Robertson-Walker metric for r = 1, and r is an arbitrary function of λ. This is a geodesic equation on S1  ×  S3 with a non-affine parameter, where the affine parameter μ is recovered using [formula]. Since these are unparameterised null geodesics of S1  ×  S3, then they can be mapped into the geodesics of [\eqref=eq:null_H_final]. Summarising, we have proven that null geodesics of [\eqref=eq:null_H_final], which are the Kepler motions identified under projective transformations, are in one-to-one correspondence with geodesics on

[formula]
