Enhancing the stability of the synchronization of multivariable coupled oscillators

Introduction

Synchronization processes on complex networks has received a lot of attention during the last decades [\cite=boccaletti2006] [\cite=arenas2008] [\cite=barrat2008]. The interplay between the dynamical evolution of oscillators and their local interactions (as given by the complex topology of a network) usually results in non-trivial phenomena of relevance to physical, biological, technological and social systems. First introduced by Pecora and Carroll [\cite=pecora1998], the Master Stability Function (MSF) is nowadays one of the main theoretical methods for the study of network synchronization. MSF is indeed a powerful tool to analyze the stability of the synchronization manifold when identical systems of oscillators are diffusively coupled. Originally applied to undirected networks, the MSF approach has been later extended to investigate enhancements and optimization of complete synchronization in weighted and asymmetric topologies (see [\cite=boccaletti2006] [\cite=arenas2008], and references therein).

In [\cite=motter2005a] the authors stated the so-called heterogeneity paradox, i.e. the fact that heterogeneous networks, wherein distances between nodes are relatively short, are less stable, in terms of synchronization, than their homogeneous counterparts. Soon after, a proper and adequate weighting of the link strengths was shown to overcome this paradox, based again on concepts sparkling from the MSF formalism [\cite=chavez2005] [\cite=motter2005b]. Following works, have shown how different network's topological features influence the stability of the synchronous state, such as: heterogeneity of the node degree, degree-degree correlations, average shortest-path, betweenness centrality or clustering. These latter studies indicate that altering the structure of a network may result in maximizing the stability of the synchronous state, thus achieving a maximally stable synchronization structure [\cite=nishikawa2005]. Enhancement of the networks' synchronizability can also be achieved by the application of genetic algorithms increasing the stability of the synchronized state. In this case, the networks self-organize by disconnecting the hubs and connecting peripheral nodes, thus increasing the homogeneity and leading to what is known as entangled networks [\cite=donetti2005].

In our study, we report the enhancement of the stability of complete synchronization of an ensemble of dynamical units, when coupled simultaneously in different dimensions. We are concerned with a multivariable coupling, where the dynamical systems are coupled through different dimensions according to a certain structure of connections (see Fig.[\ref=fig01] for a schematic illustration). In particular, we consider a generic dynamical system whose associated vector state [formula] (with [formula]) evolves according to [formula]. Each one of the m state variables of the dynamical system at a given node can be coupled to the corresponding variable of any of the other systems (i.e., nodes) of the network.

Equivalently, we can think of our system as a network with l  ≤  m layers, each one accounting for the structure of couplings at each variable of the system. This multilayer point of view illustrated in Fig.[\ref=fig01] is, in fact, just accounting for a multivariable coupling between the nodes of a network, nevertheless it will help us to provide a more concrete representation of the structure of the system, and possible connections to applications. So we will make use of it at certain points. If the coupling between oscillators does not include some of the state variables, i.e. l  <  m, the topology of the corresponding layers to those variables would be trivially given by a zero adjacency matrix, so we would not consider them to be proper layers (as is the case of the layer corresponding to variable z in Fig.[\ref=fig01]). For simplicity, we consider a bidirectional coupling between the same variables of each system (i.e. each layer is an undirected network). This is illustrated in Fig. [\ref=fig01] with an example of the case l = 2 and m = 3.

Interestingly, our framework connects with the so-called hypernetwork formalism introduced by Sorrentino [\cite=sorrentino2012]. In this latter work, the author shows that a MSF approach to hypernetwork synchronization is possible when the Laplacian matrices [\cite=laplacian] of different layers (accounting for the coupling through each variable) have the same basis of eigenvectors, i.e., when they are simultaneously diagonalizable. This is a condition that has been shown to be fulfilled for two layers in three cases: (i) the Laplacian matrices of the different layers are commuting (a condition that automatically allows for a MSF approach whatever the number of layers if the Laplacian matrices form a pairwise commuting set), (ii) one of the two layers is unweighted and fully connected, or (iii) one of the two layers has an adjacency matrix of the form Aij = aj with i,j = 1,...,N. Additionally, Ref. [\cite=irving2012] contains an extension of the approach in [\cite=sorrentino2012] to more general topologies by making use of a simultaneous block diagonalization of Laplacian matrices corresponding to different layers, thereby decreasing the dimensionality of the linear stability problem.

In our work, we consider the topology to be the same in each layer, trivially falling, from the of view of hypernetworks, into category (i) of Ref. [\cite=sorrentino2012]. This way, we present a study on how the stability of the synchronous state is enhanced by finding an optimal balance for the coupling between the different variables in a network of identical oscillators with multivariable coupling. On the one hand, we provide results based on extensive numerical simulations of networks of Rössler-like oscillators to show the applicability of the proposed ideas and how the MSF can help us to find the adequate balance between the couplings that optimizes the stability of the synchronous state of a network. On the other hand, by constructing an electronic version of the model, we show that these predictions are in good agreement with the experimental evidences in spite of the idealizations used in the theoretical treatment.

Coupling through different variables with identical topology

In this section we explain how stability of the synchronous state can be enhanced by engineering a multivariable coupling function between nodes in a network and what balance between coupling variables is the most adequate. For the sake of concreteness we focus on a set of Rössler-like oscillators [\cite=modelo] coupled to their neighbors through both the x and the y variables, whose dynamics evolve according to the following equations:

[formula]

where α1 = 500, α2 = 200, α3 = 10,000, β = 10, Γ = 20, γ = 50, δ = 8.772, μ = 15, ψ = 20, φ = 50 and (1 - dr)σX and drσY account for the coupling strengths of variables x and y. As we explain below, this chaotic oscillator has the highly non-trivial characteristic of being quite robust when implemented in electronic circuits. The adjacency matrices AX and AY contain the topology of each of two layers, each one accounting for the coupling through the x and x variables. Elements aXij and aYij are one when nodes i and j are connected and zero otherwise. With these parameters the oscillators display chaotic dynamics due to the nonlinearity introduced in Gxi, which consists on a piecewise function defined as:

[formula]

The coupling between oscillators is here controlled by two parameters: σ being the coupling strength and dr controlling how the coupling strength is distributed between variables x and y. This way, dr = 0 (dr = 1) leads to a coupling restricted to variable x (y), while a sweep of dr in the interval

[formula]

Numerical simulations

With the aim of testing the predictions of the MSF, we simulate a network of N = 6 bidirectionally coupled Rössler-like systems, see Fig. [\ref=fig01] and Eq. ([\ref=system]). We introduce an additive Gaussian noise term (with zero mean) in the x variable whose strength is given by the parameter η. Next, we calculate the synchronization error ε of the network as a function of the coupling σ and the noise strength η, for different values of dr. This way, we are able to check the robustness of the stability of the synchronized manifold depending on how the coupling is distributed among the x and y variables of the system. To facilitate the comparison with the MSF predictions, we plot the results as a function of ν  =  σγ2, instead of σ, being γ2 = 2.382 for the particular network structure shown in Fig. [\ref=fig01]. This choice can be justified on the grounds that all the important information from the point of view of the synchronization is given by the MSF value of the eigenmode associated to γ2, as the eigenmode associated to γ6 is never pushed beyond the boundaries of the synchronization region within the experimentally accessible range of coupling strengths. Figure [\ref=fig03] shows the two-dimensional plots ε(ν,η) obtained for dr = 0 (coupling only through the x variable), dr = 0.5 (x and y couplings are equally active) and dr = 1 (coupling only through the y variable). For each of these three cases, the coupling strength σ is modified and the synchronization error between all oscillators is calculated (see caption of Fig.[\ref=fig03] for details). We consider that the network is out of synchrony for synchronization errors ε > 0.6 (red regions in Fig. [\ref=fig03]).

When the coupling is introduced through the x variable (Fig. [\ref=fig03].(a)), the Rössler-like oscillators behave as a class III for any value of the noise strength (within the range 0 < η < 5), i.e. the system only synchronizes for intermediate values of the coupling strength ν. When the noise strength η is increased, the synchronization error increases, leading to a complete loss of the synchronization for large values of η. For couplings such that ν  ≈  1.2 or larger, the network becomes unstable in the sense that the strong coupling makes the individual oscillators abandon the basin of the attractor, and their dynamics blow up. This type of instability is to be expected, as a similar phenomenon is observed in individual Rössler-like oscillators for some initial conditions (see, e.g., Ref. [\cite=sevilla2015]). The reader should notice that no such problems beset the computation of the MSF, as the maximum Lyapunov exponent transverse to the synchronization manifold is computed from effectively one individual oscillator along a trajectory that follows the attractor dynamics. Thus, there is no contradiction in the fact that the MSF determines the attractor dynamics to be synchronizable, while the actual simulation of a network of 6 oscillators never attains attractor dynamics. Nevertheless, this is an example of the importance of checking the practical applications of the MSF predictions, specially for high values of coupling strengths.

When coupling is only introduced through the y variable (Fig. [\ref=fig03].(b)) the oscillators behave as class II systems for low values of η, as expected. Nevertheless, for moderate values of the noise strength (3  <  η  <  5) the system shifts to a behavior similar to that of class III systems, synchronizing only for intermediate values of the coupling strength. Finally, when the noise is further increased (η  >  5, not shown here), the network is not able to reach the synchronized state for any value of the coupling, behaving as a class I system. This way, despite being a class II system (when coupled through the y variable), the addition of noise can make system behave differently.

Finally, it is also worth analyzing how the combination of both layers increases the stability of the synchronized manifold. Figure [\ref=fig03].(c) shows the synchronization error for dr = 0.5, i.e. when the coupling is equally distributed among both X and Y layers. We can observe that, as suggested by the theoretical predictions shown in Fig. [\ref=fig02], the combined coupling of the x and y variables enhances the network stability, so that the synchronization of the system is maintained even for high values of the noise strength. Obviously, only for small values of the coupling strength, here measured as ν, unsynchronized motion is observed, as it is expected in class II systems.

Note that the boundaries of the region where synchronization becomes robust show an excellent agreement with the zero crossings of the MSF. On the other hand, in the areas where synchronization is most robust against the presence of noise, the optimal ν from that point of view is not always close to the minimum of the MSF. This is not surprising, considering that we are using noise strengths of the order η  =  5, which are certainly beyond any reasonable definition of infinitesimal perturbations, a necessary requirement for obtaining the MSF. The addition of finite perturbations, being a largely unexplored issue, are beyond of the scope of the MSF framework, and require specific numerical studies adapted to each particular topology, even if some general behaviour has been identified [\cite=gutierrez2011].

Experimental analysis

To test the robustness of the theoretical predictions given by the MSF and the numerical simulations, we have implemented the electronic version of the Rössler system described in Eq. [\ref=system]. A schematic representation of the experimental design is shown in Fig. [\ref=fig04]. It consists of an electronic array (EA), a personal computer (PC) and a multifunction data card (DAQ) composed by 12 analog to digital converters (ADCs) and 6 digital to analog converter (DACs). The ADCs are used for sampling the variable x of the oscillators, while the DACs generate six noisy signals that perturb the dynamics of each node separately. The EA comprises 6 Rössler-like electronic circuits forming a spiderweb network (blue nodes), with one central node and five peripheral nodes. Each node has two individual electronic couplers, one for the x variable and the second for the y variable, both controlled by a two digital potentiometers (XDCP), which are adjusted by a digital signal coming from ports P0.0 - 1 (DO). P0.0 is used to increase or decrease the resistance of the voltage divisor (σ), and P0.1 sets the value of the resistance (the resolution allowing for 100 discretized steps).

The noisy signals are designed in Labview, using the library Gaussian White Noise VI [\cite=GWN] that generates six different Gaussian-distributed pseudorandom sequences bounded between

Conclusions

We have seen how an adequate distribution of the coupling strength between the variables of a dynamical system leads to an enhancement of the stability of the synchronized manifold. In particular, we have shown that it is possible obtain a MSF that depends on the parameter dr accounting for the distribution of strength, while maintaining the global coupling constant. Interestingly, we report the existence of an optimal value of dr indicating what is the most adequate amount of coupling to be considered at each coupling variable. The optimal value of dr is independent of the topology of the network, as long as we use the same coupling structure among all variables.

Using electronic circuits, we have also checked the robustness of the results when noise and parameter mismatch are considered, which confirms the theoretical predictions given by the parametric MSF and, in its turn, reveal that the requirement of the oscillators to be identical can be relaxed.

The proposed framework of decomposing the different dimensions of the system (variables) in interconnected layers paves the way to the use of the multilayer networks tools [\cite=kivela2014] [\cite=boccaletti2014] to further analyze synchronization phenomena in multivariable coupled systems. Indeed, the current theoretical efforts in network theory to define and study complex structures resulting from the interaction of networks, e.g. interdependent networks and multiplex networks among others, have made great progress in recent times, in showing new emergent phenomena with no counterpart in single (monolayer) complex networks [\cite=aguirre2014] [\cite=gao2012] [\cite=aguirre2013] [\cite=radichi2013]. New developments in that direction could be further extend the results we here present, either using, e.g., the insight developed within the hypernetwork formalism [\cite=sorrentino2012] [\cite=irving2012], or using new approaches for analyzing multilayer networks [\cite=dedomenico2013].

Indeed, our methodology has some limitations that must be further explored in the future. First of all, the fact that the coupling must have the same topological structure at all variables is a strict constraint, since real systems may have different configurations depending on the coupling variable. More general, fully multilayer topologies could be considered by resorting to the hypernetwork formalism introduced in [\cite=sorrentino2012], and for greater generality one can use the method in Ref. [\cite=irving2012]. With this methodology, the case of AX  ≠  AY could be addressed at the cost of introducing some more complexity to the problem. Nevertheless, it would be of great interest, since it would raise new questions such as what the adequate combination of topologies would be given a specific distribution of weights dr. Second, since the parametric MSF depends on the dynamical system implemented in the network, we can not guarantee the existence of an optimal balance of the distribution of coupling between layers in other dynamical systems, at least until their corresponding MSF have been analyzed.
