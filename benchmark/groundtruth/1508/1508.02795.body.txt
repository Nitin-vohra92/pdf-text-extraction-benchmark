We study process of radiative neutrino pair emission |e〉  →  |g〉  +  γ  +  ν from coherently excited heavy ions (quantum mixture of two ionic states, the ground and an excited states) in circular motion. Determination of the neutrino mass is found to be possible with simultaneous detection of the photon and one of neutrinos in the pair down to the level of the smallest neutrino mass of order 5 meV in the three flavor scheme.

Introduction

Conventional neutrino sources have been weak decay products of elementary particles (mainly pion and muon) and β  -  nuclei. It was recently proposed [\cite=pair_beam] that circulating excited heavy ions may become another unique source producing large amounts of pairs of neutrino and anti-neutrino of the same flavor νaa,a  =  e,μ,τ. Quantum mixture of excited and ground ionic states, realized by laser irradiation from counter-propagating directions against ions, inputs an ionic internal energy into the orbital motion, leading to a new kind of non-linear resonance. This resonance gives for rate calculations a stationary point in the crucial time integral of the phase factor, which otherwise monotonically varies, hence giving much smaller rates with much lower neutrino energies, as in the case of synchrotron radiation [\cite=schwinger]. When the quantum number of excited level is appropriately chosen, neutrino pairs may be emitted with large rates during the resonance decay time. Produced neutrino energies may reach the GeV region suitable for oscillation experiments.

In the previous work [\cite=nu-oscillation_in_pair_beam] physics related to the pair emission process |e〉  →  |g〉  +  ν was discussed. In the present work, we examine a different process: radiative emission of neutrino pair (RENP) |e〉  →  |g〉  +  γ  +  ν from circulating excited heavy ions. Relative parities between the state |e〉 and the state |g〉 in this case are different (-  ), while they are the same (+  ) in the case of non-radiative neutrino pair emission. Thus, two processes cannot occur simultaneously. In order to avoid strong electric dipole transition (a purely QED process) against RENP, it is necessary to have a large angular momentum change like |ΔJ|  ≥  2 between two ionic states, |e〉 and |g〉. A candidate ionic state for |e〉 is Ne-like heavy ion states in the configuration of (2p53s)J = 2, for instance Pb72 + giving the first metastable state of JP = 2- of energy O(1)keV. In this work we shall not attempt a serious search for the best candidate ion, since this requires both of detailed experimental R and D works related to acceleration and dedicated atomic physics calculation. We shall concentrate on experimental principles and rate estimates assuming a hopefully reasonable set of parameter values.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In the next section we recapitulate the main features of beam RENP from quantum coherent heavy ion beam, offering an intuitive understanding in terms of the non-linear resonance. Section 3 is the main part of the present work and provides calculation of RENP spectrum rates, both when neutrino variables are integrated out and when one of neutrino variables is left for its detection. Section 4 addresses the question of the sensitivity to the smallest neutrino mass in the three flavor scheme and discusses how small one can determine the smallest neutrino mass taking the case of normal hierarchical (NH) mass pattern..

Throughout this work we use the natural unit of c  =  1.

Resonance condition of coherently excited ion in circular motion

We first recapitulate the important feature of beam RENP.

A promising way to prepare a coherent state of excited and ground states is via laser irradiation, often more than two lasers for neutrino pair emission. It may lead to a quantum mixture of two states,

[formula]

where the angle and the phase, θc and φc, may vary in time, but we consider a shorter time scale than this variation time. Without any phase relaxation (a reasonable assumption after the circulating beam energy reaches its maximum), this state maintains its quantum nature, and various observable quantities are given in terms of the density matrix |c〉〈c| for the pure quantum state. Its off-diagonal element ρeg  =   sin (2θc)e- iφc / 2 is called the coherence. An experimental method (adiabatic Raman excitation) realizing a high coherence is described and was successfully applied in [\cite=psr_observation] to gain a high level of quantum coherence of several % in a macroscopic system of hydrogen molecules in a gas phase.

Unlike synchrotron radiation [\cite=schwinger], the crucial time integral of phase factor eiΦ(t) contains two contributions: the one coming from the ion circular motion and the other from the internal transition. These two terms may have phases of different signs in the time integral, and there is a possibility of phase cancellation. The cancellation is interpreted as a kind of resonance, and the resonance condition is given by the stationarity condition, ∂tΦ  =  0. Emission of photon of energy ω and neutrino pair of energies Ei,i  =  1,2, in RENP gives the resonance condition,

[formula]

when all three particles γ,ν, are assumed to be emitted at the forward direction. Since the angular distribution is well collimated around the forward direction, this is a reasonable assumption at least for an estimate. The constant γ here is the boost factor determined by a circular velocity v: [formula]. The radius of the circular motion denoted here by ρ is equal to the Zeeman splitting energy eB / (Mγ) under a magnetic field B for circular motion. The time t here is the look-back time measured from a fixed present time t = 0, and for t  ≪  ρ the resonance formation time tr is calculated from ([\ref=resonance_condition]) as

[formula]

The RENP photon spectrum is continuous and the total energy of three particles is bounded from above: ω  +  E1  +  E2  ≤  2εegγ. This gives tr  ≥  ρ  /  γ. Numerically, taking the total energy of order its maximum 2εegγ, tr  =  ρ  /  γ  ~  3  ×  10- 10s for ρ  =  4km and γ  =  5  ×  104. Dominant contribution to the phase integral comes from the resonance region, and this integral is approximately [formula]. The width factor [formula] is of order 3  ×  10- 12s for εeg  =  1keV,ρ  =  4km, namely the resonance is very sharp, Δtr  ≪  tr, in the time domain, and is very broad in the energy domain. The resonance shape in the energy domain is not of a simple Lorentzian type.

More precisely, the resonance behavior of the phase integral is worked out, using the technique of [\cite=pair_beam], by the formula,

[formula]

for a neutrino pair emission of masses, mi,mj. Emission angles (ψ,θ for the photon, ψi,θi  ,i = 1,2 for the neutrino pair) are defined for the forward direction along the circulating beam to be at θ  =  ψ  =  0. For simplicity we took the small neutrino mass limit, which should be sufficient for our consideration of much larger neutrino energies. In this Airy-type of integral the development time tr and the resonance width Δtr are

[formula]

giving

[formula]

The allowed range of dimensionless function D is 0  ~  1. The restriction D  ≥  0 along with positivity of variables gives constraints on angular variables and energies of all three particles.

It is necessary to irradiate lasers from the counter-propagating directions against the circulating beam at lease once in each revolution of circular motion, in order to efficiently re-excite lost available heavy ions. Moreover, irradiation from the counter-propagating directions effectively boosts laser frequencies in optical and infrared regions into the keV range of X-rays.

RENP spectrum rates from circulating excited ions

The RENP idea has originally been developed for small scale laboratory experiments aiming at systematic exploration of unknown neutrino properties [\cite=renp_overview]. The macro-coherent amplification (without the wavelength limitation) of otherwise tiny weak rates in atomic processes is the key concept for success of this project. This way one may effectively enhance weak rates by a factor [formula] where n is the number density of atoms in the available level. We recently observed the macro-coherent amplification in weak QED processes [\cite=psr_observation], but there are still many steps towards the final goal.

In the present work we shall instead employ quantum coherence at a single ion level: the macro-coherence amplification is not necessary. But if it exists, it certainly helps much in giving much larger rates than given here. Acceleration of coherently excited ion in the present scheme is a new innovation and would require much R and D works, but it has a potential of producing coherent gamma ray beam if a macro-coherence is realized [\cite=pair_beam], which may have rewarding applications.

We now work out RENP spectrum rates from circulating excited ions. The process for a single ion is |e〉  →  |g〉  +  γ  +  νij  ,i = 1,2,3, where νi and j are mass eigen-states (in the Majorana case νi  =  i). The important angular variable dependence of emitted neutrinos is in D, which is to a good approximation quadratic in angular variables as shown in eq.([\ref=angular_constraint_eq]). One can integrate over these angular variables by rescaling their magnitudes by 1 / γ, resulting in the following equation ([\ref=integrals]). The photon energy spectrum when two neutrino variables are integrated out is then calculated in a convenient integral form of two neutrino energies scaled by the maximum total energy ωm, xi = Ei  /  ωm,i  =  1,2,

[formula]

where |p〉 is an ionic state having a higher excitation energy than |e〉. In the example of Ne-like ion of |e〉  =  (2p53s)J = 2 one of these states may be |p〉  =  (2p53p)J = 1. We assumed εpe  =  εeg / 10 (close to Ne-like ion level spacing for this type of |p〉) for simplicity. The dipole moment dpe is related to the E1 transition rate γpe which we assume of order 100 MHz. The step function Θ(G) is defined by the property: = 1 for G > 0 and = 0 for G < 0. The neutrino energy range in the integral here is determined by G  ≥  0 and xi  ≥  mi / (2εegγ).

In this formula we incorporated finite neutrino mass effects only kinematically, hence there is no rate difference between the Majorana and Dirac neutrinos. The matrix element factor distinguishes Majorana and Dirac cases and shall be treated below. The boost factor (γ) dependence is different from the case of neutrino-pair beam, and is larger by γ2 than the previous case, as expected from a γ  -   scaling law [\cite=pair_beam].

Without any experimental R and D works, it is difficult to estimate the number of excited heavy ions with a high coherence denoted by the parameter N|ρeg(0)|2. We took 108 for this value under this circumstance. This is the most important uncertainty in rate estimates of the present work. The overall RENP rate factor R of eq.([\ref=overall_rate]) in the (εeg,γ) plane are plotted in Fig([\ref=renp_kev_rate_contour]). and Fig([\ref=massless_rates]) we illustrate photon spectral rates for a single massless neutrino pair emission, showing their sensitivity to the energy ratio εpe  /  εeg. We may judge from these figures that RENP from circulating coherent heavy ion can be measured with high enough rates, if N|ρeg(0)|2 is not too small.

A term

[formula]

is added in the Majorana case to squared matrix elements common to Dirac and Majorana terms, |c2ij|, in the pair emission of mass sigenstates (i,j), This term arises from anti-symmetrized wave functions of two neutrinos, only present for identical Majorana fermions [\cite=my-prd-07]. Here Uei,i = 1,2,3, is the 3  ×  3 unitary matrix elements describing the neutrino mixing, and its elements have been determined from oscillation experiments [\cite=mixing_parameters] except one (in the Dirac case) or three (in the Majorana case) phase factors. The important difference from RENP of SPAN project [\cite=renp_overview] is that the conservation laws of energy and momentum do not hold, and contributions near the mass thresholds Ei  ≈  mi can exist for any given photon energy ω. It is however found in the present work that the neutrino mass suppression given by mi / Ei is severe at high neutrino energies Ei for the Majorana/Dirac distinction.

Non-conservation of energy and momentum actually means that non-conserved amounts are compensated by ion de-excitation and its recoil, which are a small portion of their total amounts. It is however important to recover these by re-pumping ions with laser irradiation from counter-propagating direction at a straight section of the synchrotron machine. This way one justifies the method of rate calculation presented here.

The main background when only a photon is detected is the three photon decay in which two photons escape detection. This background is rejected to some extent by subtracting escaped three photon events. The subtraction may be effective by different spectral shapes in the two processes. Still, there might be substantial background coming in after the subtraction. In this case one would have to rely on parity violating quantities such as emergent circular polarization that exist only in weak interaction process in order to unambiguously identity RENP. One needs a detailed study of the background rejection based on simulations taking into account a detector design.

Neutrino mass determination and comparison with SPAN

An efficient determination of the smallest neutrino mass m0 requires a more refined measurement. It indeed becomes possible to determine the smallest neutrino mass, if one of pair neutrinos is simultaneously detected along with a photon. The double energy spectrum of γ  +  νi is given by

[formula]

where δM  =  1 for the Majorana neutrino and δM  =  0 for the Dirac neutrino.

Detection probability of a single neutrino event is estimated by the factor σnNL where nN is the nucleon number density and L is the detector's size along the neutrino beam. The cross section is of order 10- 39  ~  10- 38cm2 for a 1 GeV neutrino, which gives σnNL  ~  10- 11  ~  10- 10 (or smaller depending on lower detected neutrino energy) for a single neutrino detection using ~  100 m detector size. One should multiply this factor to rate numbers shown in the presented figures, in order to derive actual detection rates of double events.

To obtain realistic absolute rates for measurements, it is necessary to use a level spacing larger than of order keV, as is evident from rate numbers in Fig([\ref=renp_kev_rate_contour]) and Fig([\ref=mdkev_3_massive_rates]). Since we consider 0(1)keV energy range for the level spacing, εeg, the maximum neutrino energy 2εegγ is at most of order 100 MeV for γ  <  O(104). It is thus practical to consider double detection of combinations, γ  +  νe and γ  +  e, since the charged current reactions νμ  →  μ require neutrino energies much larger than the muon mass. Thus, the relevant spectrum rate is

[formula]

Neutrino detectors should be placed next to the photon detector at the synchrotron site to make easier coincidence experiments.

The most promising case is to take the neutrino energy near the maximally allowed value ωm  =  2εegγ, as shown for ωm = 100MeV in Fig([\ref=mdkev_3_massive_rates]) and Fig([\ref=mdkev_3_massive_difference]) in which the sensitivity to the smallest neutrino mass to of order 5 meV is indicated. The smallest neutrino mass range can be explored by devising a plot of deviation from the unity of the ratio relative to the three massless neutrino production rate, (dΓ(0)  -  dΓ(m0)  ) / dΓ(0), which is shown for a few choices of the smallest neutrino mass m0 in Fig([\ref=mdkev_3_massive_difference]). The photon spectrum data may be obtained at different fixed neutrino energies, which make analysis of absolute mass determination easier. If calculated double detection rates are too small for a given detector design, one should think of a machine construction of larger boost factor γ. An increase of γ, for instance by 3, raises detection rates by a large factor, 700 in this example. There is no sensitivity to CP violating phases, unless two neutrinos are simultaneously detected.

Let us compare the process of beam RENP discussed here with RENP of SPAN project [\cite=renp_overview]. A marked difference in experimental methods is that the trigger laser irradiation is necessary for SPAN, while it is unnecessary for the beam RENP. Accordingly, the macro-coherence is required for SPAN, while it is only the coherence at the single ion level in the beam RENP. In terms of measurable quantities SPAN has a better sensitivity for the smallest neutrino mass determination because of many thresholds present, while the threshold rise is hardly visible here. It would be instructive to write parameter dependence of rates in two cases. Disregarding common factors such as G2FN|ρeg(0)|2, the rate in the quantum beam scales with ~  10- 10γ6γpe(εeg  /  keV)4, while SPAN RENP scales with ~  1(n / 1021cm- 3)2γpg(eV  /  εeg)2 in the same unit. We took the radius factor of [formula] for this comparison.

The important item for future R and D works is fabrication of (1) intense lasers with high quality to obtain large excited atom density n for SPAN, and (2) realizing heavy ion circulation with high coherence ρeg for its RENP. In both cases a high coherence, either at the macroscopic level or at the single ion level, is of crucial importance for further developments.

In summary, radiative neutrino pair emission from circulating excited heavy ions is useful for determination of the smallest neutrino mass down to 5 meV level, if a high coherence can be achieved in the quantum heavy ion beam. RENP from circulating heavy ions is complementary to the neutrino pair beam, and two of them combined may give a comparative perspective to SPAN project.
