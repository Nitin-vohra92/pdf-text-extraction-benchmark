A singular Demailly-Pun theorem

Introduction

The classical Nakai-Moishezon ampleness criterion (see e.g. [\cite=Kl] and references therein) characterizes ample line bundles on a projective variety as those which have positive intersection against all subvarieties. This was later extended to [formula]-divisors by Campana-Peternell [\cite=CP]. In a groundbreaking paper, Demailly and Pun [\cite=DP] proved a vast generalization of this result, which holds for all real (1,1) classes on a compact Kähler manifold. More precisely, they proved that the Kähler cone of a compact Kähler manifold is one of the connected components of the positive cone, consisting of classes which have positive intersection against all analytic subvarieties. Very recently, a new proof of this theorem was obtained by combining the main result of our previous work [\cite=CT] with a result of Chiose [\cite=Ch].

In this note, we prove an extension of the Demailly-Pun theorem [\cite=DP] to singular varieties which are embedded in a smooth ambient space. A (1,1) class on the variety is just taken to be the restriction of a (1,1) class from the ambient space, and such a class is Kähler if it is so in a neighborhood of the variety inside the ambient space. This is in fact equivalent to the more intrinsic definition of a Kähler class on a compact analytic space as given for example in [\cite=Va], as shown by Pun [\cite=Pa], and this allows us to avoid discussing these more technical notions. With these observations in mind, our main theorem is the following:

Let (M,ω) be a smooth (but possibly noncompact and incomplete) Kähler manifold, and E  ⊂  M be a compact analytic subvariety. Let α be a closed smooth real (1,1) form on M such that

[formula]

for all positive-dimensional irreducible analytic subvarieties V  ⊂  E, and for all [formula]. Then there exist an open neighborhood U of E in M and a smooth function [formula] such that [formula] is a Kähler metric on U. If M is an open subset of the regular locus of some projective variety, then the inequalities

[formula]

for all V as above suffice to reach the same conclusion.

This theorem answers a question that was posed to us by R.J. Conlon and H.-J. Hein, in relation to their paper [\cite=CH] (see also [\cite=CH1]). Applications of this result to the study of the Kähler cone of asymptotically conical Calabi-Yau manifolds will appear in a forthcoming revision of [\cite=CH].

The main tools we use are the Demailly-Pun theorem itself, for smooth compact Kähler manifolds, and our recent theorem [\cite=CT] which shows that the non-Kähler locus of a nef and big class on a compact complex manifold equals the null locus of the class. The idea is to work by induction on the dimension on E (as in [\cite=DP]), and to prove the result by working on a resolution of singularities (as in [\cite=CT]). This way we avoid any technical discussion of currents on singular analytic spaces.

In future work, we hope to address the extension of the Demailly-Pun theorem [\cite=DP] as well as the main result of our previous work [\cite=CT] to general compact Kähler (reduced and irreducible) analytic spaces.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=main]

This section contains the proof of Theorem [\ref=main].

Clearly we may assume that no component of E is zero-dimensional, since for those the result is trivial.

Let us first assume that E is irreducible and 1-dimensional. Let ν:  →  M be an embedded resolution of singularities of E  ⊂  M, so that [formula] is smooth, connected and Kähler, and the proper transform Ẽ of E is a smooth compact Riemann surface. We will also write ν:Ẽ  →  E for the induced map, so that ν*α is a smooth closed real (1,1) form with [formula]. Therefore the class

[formula]

,

[formula]

ψ=(ψ̂, B|z|+A-B-1)

[formula]

on Ẽ is nef. If assume that M is an open subset of the regular locus of some projective variety, then this holds because we have [formula] for all positive-dimensional irreducible subvarieties V in Ẽ (using [\eqref=pos]), and so [\cite=DP] gives that the class

[formula]

να 0,

[formula]

ν(α ω)>0,

[formula]

is nef on Ẽ, we can find Kähler classes on Ẽ arbitrarily close to it, and therefore there exists a Kähler metric [formula] on Ẽ such that

[formula]

for [formula]. Now for [formula] sufficiently large, the class

[formula]

is nef on Ẽ, and suppose for a contradiction that t0 > 0. By definition the class

[formula]

would be Kähler. Also V must be properly contained in Ẽ, because we have

[formula]

by [\eqref=todo2]. Then ν(V) is an irreducible analytic subvariety of E (possibly a point), of dimension strictly less than dim E, and with the same positivity property [\eqref=pos], so by induction we can find an open neighborhood W of ν(V) in M and a smooth function η on W such that [formula]. Therefore, in the open neighborhood ν- 1(W) of V the smooth function ν*η satisfies [formula]. Since [formula] is Kähler on Ẽ and t0 > 0, this implies that

[formula]

contradicting [\eqref=todo3]. Therefore we must have [formula], and so the class

[formula]

is nef on Ẽ, and since

[formula]

by [\eqref=pos], we can apply [\cite=DP] and see that this class is also big, i.e. it contains a Kähler current [formula], which we may assume has analytic singularities thanks to Demailly's regularization theorem (see [\cite=DP]). Also, if [formula] then ν(V) is an irreducible subvariety of E of the same dimension as V, and ν:V  →  ν(V) is bimeromorphic and so we have [formula], thanks to assumption [\eqref=pos]. This means that the null locus of the class
