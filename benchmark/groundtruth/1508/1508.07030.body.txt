A proof of the SXP rule by bijections and involutions

Introduction

Let [formula] denote the plethysm of the symmetric functions f and g. While it remains a hard problem to express an arbitrary plethysm as a sum of Schur functions, many results are known in special cases. In particular, the SXP rule, first proved in [\cite=LittlewoodModular] and later, in a different way, in [\cite=ChenGarsiaRemmel], gives a surprisingly simple formula for the plethysm [formula] where sλ is the Schur function labelled by the partition λ and pr is a power sum symmetric function. It states that if λ is a partition of n then

[formula]

where the sum is over all r-multipartitions [formula] of n, [formula] is the partition with empty r-core and r-quotient [formula], [formula] is as defined in below, and [formula] is a generalized Littlewood-Richardson coefficient, as defined at the end of §[\ref=sec:LS] below.

In this note we prove the following generalization of the SXP rule.

Let λ  /  μ be a skew-partition of n and let [formula]. Then

[formula]

where the sum is over all r-multipartitions [formula] of n.

Each step in the proof uses either an explicit bijection or a sign-reversing involution. The critical second step uses a special case of a rule for multiplying a Schur function by the plethysm [formula], where hα is the complete symmetric function labelled by the composition α. This rule was first proved in [\cite=DesarmenienLeclercThibon] and is stated here as Proposition [\ref=prop:bs]. A reader familiar with the basic results on symmetric functions and willing to assume this rule should find the proof largely self-contained. In particular, we do not assume the Littlewood-Richardson rule. We show in [\eqref=eq:LR] in the Appendix that a version of the Littlewood-Richardson rule follows from Theorem [\ref=thm:main] by setting ; alternatively, assuming the Littlewood-Richardson rule, it is routine to deduce Theorem [\ref=thm:main] from [\eqref=eq:SXP].

An earlier proof of both the Littlewood-Richardson rule and the SXP rule was given by Remmel and Shimozono in [\cite=RemmelShimozono], using a pairing on semistandard tableaux defined by Lascoux and Schützenberger in [\cite=LascouxSchutzenberger]. The proof given here uses the generalization of this pairing to tuples of semistandard tableaux. In a loose sense the proof here is related to the proof in [\cite=RemmelShimozono] by replacing monomial symmetric functions with complete symmetric functions. This dualization requires different ideas, and appears to offer some simplifications.

The plethysm operation [formula] is defined in [\cite=LoehrRemmel], or, with minor changes in notation, in [\cite=MacDonald], [\cite=StanleyII]. For plethysms of the form [formula] the definition can be given in a simple way: write f as a formal infinite sum of monomials in the variables [formula] and substitute xri for each xi to obtain [formula]. For example, [formula]. We note that by [\cite=LoehrRemmel], [formula]; several of the formulae we use are stated in the literature in this equivalent form.

Prerequisites on r-quotients, ribbons and tableaux

We assume the reader is familiar with partitions, skew-partitions and border-strips, as defined in [\cite=StanleyII]. We represent partitions using an r-runner abacus, as defined in [\cite=JK]. The further definitions below are taken from [\cite=DesarmenienLeclercThibon], [\cite=EvseevPagetWildon] and [\cite=RemmelShimozono].

[formula]

such that σ(j)  /  σ(j - 1) is a border-strip of size r for each j. In this case we define the r-sign of ν  /  τ by

[formula]

(Here [formula] is the height of the border-strip σ(j)  /  σ(j - 1), equal to one less than the number of rows of σ(j) it meets.) By [\cite=JK] or [\cite=WildonPlethysticMN], this definition is independent of the choice of the σ(j).

If ν  /  τ is r-decomposable then it is possible to obtain an abacus for τ by starting with an abacus for ν and making n single-step upward bead moves. It follows that if [formula] is the r-quotient of ν and [formula] is the r-quotient of τ then ν(i)  /  τ(i) is a skew-partition for each i. We define the r-quotient of ν  /  τ to be

[formula]

[formula]

such that σ(j)  /  σ(j - 1) is a border-strip of size r for each j and

[formula]

An example is shown in Figure 1 above.

The following lemma, which is used implicitly in [\cite=DesarmenienLeclercThibon], is needed in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:main]. Informally, (iii) says that the border-strips forming a horizontal r-ribbon strip are uniquely determined by its shape. Note also that (iv) explains the sense in which horizontal r-ribbon strips are 'horizontal'.

Let [formula] and [formula] and let ν  /  τ be a skew-partition of rq. The following are equivalent:

Let A be an abacus representing τ. If β is a position in A containing a bead then the row-number of the r-border-strip corresponding to a single-step downward move of this bead is the number of beads in the positions [formula]. Thus a sequence of single-step downward bead moves, moving beads in positions [formula], adds r-border-strips in decreasing order of their row number, as required by [\eqref=eq:rownumbers], if and only if [formula]. It follows that (i) and (ii) are equivalent. It is easily seen that (ii) is equivalent to (iii) and (iv).

[formula]

such that ρ(j)  /  ρ(j - 1) is a horizontal r-ribbon strip of size rαj for each j. We say that ρ(j)  /  ρ(j - 1) has label j. We denote the set of all r-ribbon tableaux of shape ν and weight α by [formula]. For an example see §[\ref=sec:example] below.

Combinatorial rules

The Jacobi-Trudi formula

The symmetric group [formula] acts on [formula] by place permutation. Given [formula] and [formula], we define g  ·  α  =  g(α  +  ρ)  -  ρ where [formula]. For later use we note that if [formula] then

[formula]

Recall that hα denotes the complete symmetric function labelled by α; if α has a strictly negative entry then we set hα  =  0. The Jacobi-Trudi formula states that if λ is a partition with exactly [formula] parts and λ  /  μ is a skew-partition then

[formula]

The proof of the formula given in [\cite=StanleyII] is by a beautiful involution. (As Stanley points out, it is the canonical instance of an involution on certain tuples of lattice paths.)

A plethystic Murnaghan-Nakayama rule

We use the following proposition in the case [formula]. The first proof was in [\cite=DesarmenienLeclercThibon], using Muir's rule [\cite=Muir]. For an involutive proof of Muir's rule see [\cite=LoehrAbacus]. The special case when [formula] and α has a single part is proved in [\cite=MacDonald]. In this case the result also follows from Chen's algorithm, as presented in [\cite=ChenGarsiaRemmel]. The special case when α has a single part was proved by the author in [\cite=WildonPlethysticMN] using a sign reversing involution. The general case then follows easily by induction, using that [formula].

Let [formula] and let [formula]. If α is a composition of n and τ is a partition then

[formula]

where the sum is over all partitions ν such that ν  /  τ is a skew-partition of rn.

A generalized Lascoux-Schützenberger involution

We begin by presenting the coplactic maps given in [\cite=Lothaire]. For further background see [\cite=LascouxSchutzenberger]. Let w be a word with entries in [formula] and let [formula]. Following the exposition in [\cite=RemmelShimozono], we replace each k in w with a right-parenthesis ')' and each k + 1 with a left-parenthesis '('. An entry k or k + 1 is k-paired if its parenthesis has a pair, according to the usual rules of bracketing, and otherwise k-unpaired. We may omit the 'k-' if it will be clear from the context. Reading w from left to right, an entry k is unpaired if and only if it sets a new record for the excess of ks over (k + 1)s; dually, reading from right to left, an entry k + 1 is unpaired if and only if it sets a new record for the excess of (k + 1)s over ks. This observation proves the following lemma.

Let w be a word with entries in [formula]. Let [formula]. The subword of w formed from the k-unpaired entries is kc(k + 1)d for some c, [formula]. Changing this subword to kc'(k + 1)d', where c', [formula] and c' + d' = c + d, while keeping all other positions the same, gives a new word which has k-unpaired entries in exactly the same positions as w.[formula]

Let Sk(w) be the word obtained from w by changing the subword of k-unpaired entries from kc(k + 1)d to kd(k + 1)c. If d  >  0, let Ek(w) be defined similarly, changing the subword to kc + 1(k + 1)d - 1, and if c  >  0, let Fk(w) be defined similarly, changing the subword to kc - 1(k + 1)d + 1.

We now extend these maps to tuples of tableaux. Let [formula] denote the content of a tableau t, and let [formula] denote its word, obtained by reading the rows of t from left to right, starting at the highest numbered row. Let [formula], let [formula] be an m-multipartition of [formula] and let [formula] be a composition of n. Let [formula] denote the set of all m-tuples [formula] of semistandard tableaux such that t(i) has shape σ(i) for each i and

[formula]

Thus if α fails to be a composition because it has a negative entry then [formula]. We call the elements of [formula] semistandard m-multitableaux of shape [formula]. The word of an m-multitableau [formula] is defined to be the concatenation [formula]. For [formula] we say that an entry of an m-multitableau [formula] is k-paired if the corresponding entry of [formula] is k-paired. Note that a word w of length n and content α uniquely determines an m-multitableau of shape [formula] satisfying [\eqref=eq:cont]; we denote this multitableau by T(w). Abusing notation slightly, we set [formula], [formula] (when defined) and [formula].

Consider the semistandard 3-multitableau

[formula]

where the 2-unpaired entries are shown in bold. Then [formula] is obtained from [formula] by changing the leftmost unpaired 3 to a 2, and [formula] is obtained from [formula] by changing the rightmost unpaired 2 to a 3. Thus

[formula]

Let [formula] be an m-multipartition and let α be a composition with exactly [formula] parts. Fix [formula]. Let [formula] and [formula] be the sets of all multitableaux in [formula] that have a k-unpaired k or a k-unpaired k + 1, respectively. Let [formula], where the unique non-zero entries are in positions k and k + 1. The maps

[formula]

are bijections and [formula] is an involution.

Let [formula]. The main work comes in showing that [formula], [formula] are semistandard (when defined). Suppose that [formula] and that the first unpaired k + 1 in [formula] corresponds to the entry in row a and column b of tableau t(j). Thus t'(i)  =  t(i) if [formula] and t'(j) is obtained from t(j) by changing this entry to an unpaired k.

Let t  =  t(i), let t'  =  t'(i) and write u(a,b) for the entry of a tableau u in row a and column b. If t' fails to be semistandard then t'(a - 1,b)  =  k. Hence t(a - 1,b)  =  k. This k is to the right of the unpaired k + 1 in [formula], so by Lemma [\ref=lemma:unpairedsubword] it is paired, necessarily with a k + 1 in row a and some column b'  >  b of t. Since

[formula]

we have t(a - 1,b')  =  k. Thus t(a,c)  =  k + 1 and t(a - 1,c)  =  k for [formula]. Since t(a - 1,b) is a pair for t(a,b'), we have that t(a - 1,b + j) is a pair for t(a,b' - j) for each j  ≤  b' - b. In particular, the k + 1 in position (a,b) of t is paired, a contradiction. Hence [formula] is semistandard. The proof is similar for Fk in the case when [formula] has an unpaired k.

It is now routine to check that EkFk and FkEk are the identity maps on their respective domains, so Ek and Fk are bijective. If the unpaired subword of [formula] is kc(k + 1)d then [formula] if d  ≥  c and [formula] if c  ≥  d. Hence Sk and SkEk are involutions. By [\eqref=eq:dotswap] the image of SkEk is as claimed.

We are ready to define the key involution in this paper. Say that a semistandard multitableau [formula] is latticed if [formula] has no k-unpaired entries for any [formula], except for 1-unpaired 1s. Let λ be a partition of n with exactly [formula] parts, let [formula] be an m-multipartition of n and let

[formula]

Observe that if [formula] then g  ·  λ is not a partition, and so no element of [formula] is latticed. Therefore the set

[formula]

contained all latticed elements of T. Let [formula]. If [formula] is latticed then define [formula]. Otherwise consider the k-unpaired entries in [formula] for each [formula]. If the rightmost k-unpaired entry (for some k) is k + 1 then define [formula]. For instance, in Example [\ref=ex:invol] we have k = 2 and [formula].

The map G:T  →  T is an involution fixing precisely the multitableaux in [formula]. Moreover, if [formula] and [formula] then [formula] for some [formula].

This follows immediately from Lemma [\ref=lemma:coplactic].

This is a convenient place to define Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. The Appendix has a proof of the equivalence with the original definition.

The Littlewood-Richardson coefficient corresponding to a partition λ of n and an m-multipartition [formula] of n is [formula].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:main]

Suppose that λ has exactly [formula] parts. The outline of the proof is as follows:

[formula]

where in each sum [formula] is an r-multipartition of n and [formula] is the (r + 1)-multipartition [formula] obtained from [formula] by appending μ.

We now give an explicit bijection or involution establishing each step. For an illustrative example see §[\ref=sec:example] below.

Apply the Jacobi-Trudi formula for skew Schur functions, as stated in §[\ref=sec:rules].

Apply Proposition [\ref=prop:bs] to each [formula].

Let T be a r-ribbon tableau of shape ν and weight α, where the composition α has exactly [formula]-parts, as in [\eqref=eq:ribbons]. Let ν have r-quotient [formula], so [formula]. Take an abacus A representing the empty partition with a multiple of r beads. The sequence [formula], where the ρ(j) are as in [\eqref=eq:ribbons], defines a sequence of single-step downward bead moves leading from A to an abacus B representing ν. For each bead moved on runner i put the label of the corresponding horizontal r-ribbon strip in the corresponding box of the Young diagram of ν(i). By Lemma [\ref=lemma:ribboneqv](iv), this defines a semistandard tableau t(i) of shape ν(i) for each i. Conversely, given [formula], one obtains a sequence of single-step downward bead moves satisfying the condition in Lemma [\ref=lemma:ribboneqv](ii), and hence an r-ribbon tableau of shape ν and content α. Thus the map sending T to [formula] is a bijection from [formula] to [formula], as required.

Fix a multipartition [formula] of n. Let

[formula]

Let G be the involution on T defined in §[\ref=sec:LS]. Let u be the semistandard μ-tableau having all its entries in its j-th row equal to j. Note that u is the unique semistandard latticed tableau μ-tableau. Thus if

[formula]

then [formula]. Let [formula]. Consider the final |μ| positions of [formula]. It is clear from the form of u that every entry k  +  1 in these positions is k - paired. If all the 1s are also paired then the final semistandard tableau in [formula] is u. If a 1 is unpaired, then by Lemma [\ref=lemma:unpairedsubword], the unpaired subword in [formula] is 1c for some c. Therefore [formula] is latticed and so [formula], and again the final semistandard tableau in [formula] is u. It follows that G restricts to an involution on Tu. By Proposition [\ref=prop:LS], the fixed point set of G, acting on either T or Tu, is [formula].

The part of the sum in [\eqref=eq:mSSYT] corresponding to the multipartition [formula] is

[formula]

The set of multitableaux [formula] in this sum is [formula]. There is an obvious bijection A:S  →  Tu given by appending u. By the remarks above, A- 1GA is an involution on S. Since [formula], it follows from Proposition [\ref=prop:LS] that the contributions to [\eqref=eq:mSSYT] from multitableaux [formula] such that [formula] cancel in pairs, leaving exactly the multitableaux appearing in the sum in [\eqref=eq:afterInvol].

This is true by our definition of the Littlewood-Richardson coefficient [formula].

Example

Let λ  =  (4,3) and let μ  =  (1). Let r = 3 and let ν  =  (6,5,4,3), as in the example in Figure 1, so [formula]. We have λ  -  μ  =  (3,3) and (1,2)  ·  λ  -  μ  =  (1,5). The horizontal 3-ribbon tableaux in the sets in [\eqref=eq:RT] are shown in Figure 2 overleaf. Applying the bijection 3-[formula] [formula] in the proof of [\eqref=eq:mSSYT] we obtain the multitableaux

[formula]

where the order corresponds to Figure 2. Similarly, applying the bijection 3-[formula] we obtain the unique element of [formula], namely

[formula]

Following the proof of [\eqref=eq:afterInvol], we now append[formula] to each multitableau and apply the involution G in §[\ref=sec:LS]. The multitableaux

[formula]

are latticed, and so are fixed by G, and

[formula]

Hence there are 3 summands contributing to [\eqref=eq:afterInvol]. Since [formula], we have [formula].

Alternatively we could apply a (very special case of) the Littlewood-Richardson rule to get [formula] and then use the usual SXP rule on each summand. This requires rather more calculation, since for both s(4,2) and s(3,3) there is significant cancellation under the involution G. (As already seen, [formula] and [formula], and [formula], and so we get [formula] is - (3 - 1) - (4 - 3)  =   - 3.) This cancellation suggests that the general form of the SXP rule in Theorem [\ref=thm:main] may have some computational advantages.

Appendix: Littlewood-Richardson coefficients

Littlewood-Richardson coefficients and products of Schur functions

Let λ  /  μ be a skew-partition of [formula]. Setting r = 1 in [\eqref=thm:main] we obtain [formula]. Since 〈sλ  /  μ,f〉  =  〈sλ,sμf〉 for any symmetric function f (see for instance [\cite=StanleyII]), it follows that if ν is any partition of n then

[formula]

An immediate corollary is that

[formula]

for all partitions λ, μ, ν; this fact is not obvious from our combinatorial definition. The following lemma, whose proof is fiddly, but essentially routine, shows that this definition is consistent with the algebraic generalization of [\eqref=eq:LR] to products of three or more Schur functions.

If [formula] is an m-multipartition of n then

[formula]

By [\eqref=eq:LR] we have

[formula]

where the sum is over all partitions [formula] such that γ(i) / γ(i + 1) is a skew-partition of |σ(i)| for each i. All further sums over the γ(i) are also subject to this condition. By [\eqref=eq:comm] we get

[formula]

For μ a partition, let u(μ) denote the μ-tableau having all entries in its j-th row equal to j. As seen in the proof of [\eqref=eq:afterInvol], u(μ) is the unique latticed semistandard μ-tableau. Thus if λ  /  μ is a skew-partition then

[formula]

For each [formula], and each partition γ, let [formula]. Suppose inductively that

[formula]

where [formula]. Then

[formula]

By [\eqref=eq:cl], the right-hand side counts the number of pairs of latticed semistandard multitableaux

[formula]

such that t(i) has shape σ(i) for each i, [formula] and [formula]. Such pairs are in an obvious bijection with the latticed semistandard multitableaux counted by [formula]. Hence [formula] is equal to the right-hand side of [\eqref=eq:mLR], as required.

Alternative definition

The Littlewood-Richardson coefficient cλμν was originally defined in [\cite=LittlewoodRichardson] as the number of latticed semistandard tableaux t of shape λ  /  μ and content ν. Generalized Littlewood-Richardson coefficients [formula] may then be defined by [\eqref=eq:mLR]. By Lemma [\ref=lemma:assoc], [\eqref=eq:comm] and [\eqref=eq:cl], to show these definitions agree, it suffices to prove the following proposition.

If λ, μ and ν are partitions then

[formula]

is equal to the number of latticed semistandard tableaux of shape λ  /  μ.

This proposition follows immediately from Lemma [\ref=lemma:shapecontent](iii) below, by setting α  =  ν and [formula]. The 'shape-content involution' given in this lemma is surely well known to experts, but the author has not found in the literature in this generality. The lemma may also be used to show that the final corollary in Stembridge's involutive proof of the Littlewood-Richardson rule [\cite=StembridgeLR] is equivalent to [\eqref=eq:LR]; this is left as a 'not-too-difficult exercise' in [\cite=StembridgeLR].

[formula]

(This is consistent with the definition of latticed semistandard multitableaux in §[\ref=sec:LS], since if [formula] then [formula] if and only if the 1-multitableau (t) is in [formula].)

Given [formula], let C(t) be the row-standard tableau of shape α  /  β defined by putting a k in row a of C(t) for every a in row k of t.

(i) is obvious. For (ii) observe that if [formula] then [formula] is not latticed if and only if there exists [formula] and an entry k + 1 in row a of t and position i of [formula] such that

[formula]

Let b be the common value. The first b - 1 - βk entries in row k of C(t) are at most a - 1, and the next entry is the number of a row a' with a'  ≥  a. The entry below is the (b - βk + 1)-th entry in row k + 1 of C(t + 1), namely a. Therefore C(t) is not semistandard. The converse may be proved by reversing this argument. It follows from (ii) that C restricts to involutions [formula] and [formula]; taking the common domain and codomain of these involutions we get (iii).
