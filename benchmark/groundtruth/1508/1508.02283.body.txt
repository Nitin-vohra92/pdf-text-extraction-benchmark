Quantum Gravito-Optics: A Light Route from Semiclassical Gravity to Quantum Gravity

Every physicist who has pondered over the fundamental theories of gravitation and quantum mechanics is perhaps convinced that there should be a theory of quantum gravity. Yet this theory that should incorporate the fundamental principles of the two seminal theories has remained elusive in spite of many serious efforts for more than half a century [\cite=carlip].  Considering the fact that these principles - the equivalence principle and general coordinate invariance for the theory of gravitation and the principle of superposition (uncertainty) and Lorentz invariance for quantum (field) theory - are simple to state and understand, this is very surprising.  The lack of any experimental clue whatsoever is usually considered as the major impediment to finding a direction [\cite=gill-unni] and this indicates that the wait for a suitable theory might still be painfully long.

However, when thinking along the lines of the development of quantum optics, there are indeed some clues to quantum gravity, due to a fundamental 'optical' equivalence, familiar in quantum optics.  The fundamental result of quantum optics is that all states of light are fully quantum mechanical and that they (their density matrix) can be represented as a diagonal mixture of coherent states, with appropriate real weight factors acting the role of distribution functions [\cite=ecg1]. The coherent state that represents 'classical' monochromatic light itself is a superposition of all number states [\cite=glauber], from [formula]  to [formula] Further, in those cases where the relevant operators are normal ordered, the quantum and classical coherence functions are exactly equal, without approximations [\cite=ecg1]. The purpose of this paper is to draw attention to a similar situation in gravity, by explicitly showing that the coherent state of gravitational radiation results from the emission of individual quanta even by a single massive binary system. We will argue that this result is an anchoring constraint on quantum gravity.

It is often argued that the unavoidable coupling between the quantized matter and states of space-time is the strong reason for the inevitable need for a theory of quantum gravity, since it would be inconsistent to consider the states of matter as quantized while quantization is not reflected in the associated field.  A significant and relevant observation in this context is that a sector of the gravitational field is in the form of radiation and that all forms and states of gravitational radiation are inherently quantum mechanical.  The optical equivalence that we mentioned introduces a fundamental equivalence between the quantum-signatured gravity and semiclassical gravity in those cases where the operator order is normal - not as an approximation, but as an exact equivalence of observables.  The detection of gravitational waves  belongs to this class because the absorbed energy corresponds to the annihilation operators acting first. Further, as we will show, emission by a massive binary system obeying quantum dynamics is a quantum coherent state. In other words, any kind gravitational radiation that is detected has to be a genuine quantum state of radiative gravity. Therefore, when a full theory of quantum gravity is formulated, its predictions for weak gravitational radiation, for which nonlinear effects can be neglected, have to match exactly with the results of semiclassical gravity in which only matter dynamics is initially treated as quantum mechanical. To stress again the salient point, the coherent radiation from the quantum mechanically treated dynamical system is in fact quantum gravitational in an exact sense, physically and mathematically. Further, the diagonal coherent state representation  [\cite=ecg1], ensures that the radiation sector of the future quantum gravity theory is already known formally and that it includes the coherent emission from a single binary system.

The best representation of a 'classical light wave' of constant cycle-averaged intensity is the coherent state. However, the coherent state is famously an elaborate quantum mechanical state, and indeed holds several fundamental features of quantum optics [\cite=glauber].  First of all it is a superposition of all number states with Poissonian weights.  It embodies the uncertainty principle in a fundamental way,  manifest through its equal fluctuations in the phase-intensity quadratures observable in 'classical' experiments, without the need for photon counting, as intensity fluctuations proportional to [formula] with a white spectrum. Just as there is really no classical light, there is no classical gravitational wave. Of course, practical experiments today cannot detect the discreteness of quanta inherent in such a wave due to the extremely large number density of gravitons in even the weakest of gravitational waves, because of their low specific energy, or energy per quantum ω.  Another important difference compared to optics is the tiny coupling constant of the radiation to the detectors.  Therefore, in contrast to optical detectors with nearly 100% efficiency, which can work with optical radiation of weak intensity and hence large [formula] fluctuations, gravitational wave detectors are effectively 'transparent'.  Hence, detectable radiation fields contain a huge number of gravitons and consequently the relative fluctuations, [formula] [formula] approaches zero. The related, but different, issue of the detectability of single gravitons has been discussed recently by F. Dyson [\cite=Dyson-IJMP13].

The most important source for gravitational radiation detectable with advanced detectors like LIGO and Virgo are orbiting binary pulsars. The dynamics of such systems within usual quantum (Schrodinger) theory is that of two particles in a central gravitational potential, even though we deal with it usually as a Newtonian problem, under suitable approximations, because the relevant action is much larger than the Planck constant. We note that there is now direct experimental evidence, from experiments with cold neutrons, that particle dynamics in a Newtonian gravitational field has quantized energy levels and observables, as predicted by the Schrodinger equation [\cite=Neutrons] and a binary neutron star system is no exception, despite its mass and size. First we show the main result of the paper, that gravitational radiation emitted by a single massive binary system within quantum theory is indeed the quantum coherent state of radiation consisting of a superposition of all number states with Poissonian weights, and then discuss the general implications. This might seem surprising at first sight, since the usual coherent state in quantum optics is typically generated by an ensemble of population-inverted atoms undergoing stimulated emission, as in  a laser, which locks the phase of the emitted wave. How is it possible that the spontaneous emission from a single gravitational atom - two massive objects in orbits around each other - be a coherent state?

Two  massive objects in a quasi-stationary orbit indeed exhibit very closely spaced Bohr-like orbital behavior at any instant, as described by the basic quantum mechanical treatment of two particles bound by the long range Coulomb-like gravitational force. The discrete, yet seemingly and practically continuous energy states of such a system is approximately

[formula]

quite in analogy with quantized orbits of charged particles. μ is the reduced mass and approaches M / 2 for nearly equal massive bodies. Since the total energy is E =  - GM1M2 / 2r, we get

[formula]

The quantum number n is of course extremely large for the massive binary neutron star system, of the order of 1076 even at the last stages of collapse. Nevertheless the energy levels are quantized in standard physical theory that expects quantum theory to be applicable to all material bodies, and in particular for this system in orbit under a long range central force. Changes in the orbit can occur only by radiation of single quanta, due to the coupling to the enormous number of open external degrees of freedom, or the gravitational environment. Since n is very large and both masses are taken to be nearly equal for approximate estimates,

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

where ω is the frequency of the emitted quantum. This is of course time dependent, but quasi-constant on the time scale of emission of a large number of quanta because ΔE is typically smaller than 10- 30 J and the power in gravitational wave emission is larger than 1020 W even in the early stages of binary evolution. Each quanta corresponds to Δn = 2, to conform to the quadrupole character of emission and its selection rule of change of angular momentum by 2 in each transition ( the states of the binary system are such that the angular momentum quantum number l≃n). Since the orbital frequency of the binary is [formula] we get ΔE = ω = 2Ω and the frequency ω of the emitted quantum 'graviton' is twice the orbital frequency Ω. (In this case, this is perhaps a coincidence specific to the particular assumptions made, but we expect this relation in general. Also, the fact that the frequency associated with the quanta emitted in a very short section of the orbit encodes the information of the full orbit in terms of its period is not surprising because we are dealing with smooth circular orbits for which a part encodes the whole). In this scenario, we expect decay of the orbit by spontaneous emission of the quanta. The instant of emission is completely random for this single system, as in all such quantum mechanical systems, because there is no possibility of stimulated emission.

For slowly varying amplitude of the radiation (cycle average intensity Ī slowly varying), we note that the average number of quanta [formula] in a short fixed duration T, which is small compared to the orbital time but long compared to the lifetime of single energy eigenstates, is

[formula]

[formula] is a very large number even for very small time intervals since ΔE = ω is miniscule and the power radiated in gravitational waves is enormous in comparison - P(ω)  ~  1025 - 1050 W during the observable gravitational evolution of such binary systems, for example. Given that the process of emission is random spontaneous emission, it can occur at any instant in the time interval T. We assume that the probability of multiple emissions at any instant is zero, which is reasonable for the single binary system. So, the probability of emission of m quanta is the Poissonian distribution,

[formula]

with a probability amplitude of

[formula]

In a given duration T of the order of an orbital cycle, the quantum process is determined by the sum of amplitudes to emit different number of quanta, each in a quantum state [formula] with the average number of quanta emitted over an interval T short compared to the orbital time constrained to be   =  ĪT / ω. The quantum state of the radiation is the superposition of all these states [formula] with corresponding amplitudes A(m,T). Noting that the emitted quanta are bosonic, each term simply adds in phase in the superposition. We thus get the final quantum state of gravitational radiation from a single massive binary system or a gravitational atom as,

[formula]

where we have written [formula] This is the same as the coherent state in quantum optics. It is given by

[formula]

obeying the fundamental quantum equation [formula] where a is the relevant annihilation operator. We have indicated that the amplitude is time dependent in general, and the actual waveform itself admits a further superposition over different frequencies, ω.  The expectation value of the gravitational field in such a state is

[formula]

indicating the harmonic 'classical' character. However, the fluctuations in amplitude and phase obey the uncertainty relation, and hence the state is fully quantum mechanical.

We have shown that the detailed quantum state of gravitational radiation emitted by a single massive binary system is a superposition of all number states, including the null (vacuum state) since no gravitational quanta might be emitted in any given time interval. Thus the coherent gravitational wave that we expect to detect soon with ground based detectors is in fact the quantum gravitational coherent state. This state has expectation values that are sinusoidal in time in the two quadratures, with a stable phase, because it is always an eigenstate of the annihilation operator with its time dependence â(t) = â(0) exp ( - iωt). This is consistent with the physical feature that emission of the low energy quanta does not affect the orbital phase of the binary system during the short interval T, which is much smaller than the orbital period. A notable feature in our demonstration is that multiple spontaneous emission events in a single physical system - the binary system - over an extended temporal interval results in the same coherent state radiation expected from the stimulated emission from a statistical ensemble (multiple systems and multiple events at an instant, as in many atoms emitting coherent photons in a laser medium). This result relies on the fact that we are dealing with very high quantum number Rydberg-like gravitational orbits which are susceptible to even the smallest of external perturbations (of the order of energy level separation) and there are a large number of quanta emitted in a duration much smaller than the orbital period. Our result applies also to atomic systems in very large-n orbits where the electromagnetic radiation is expected to be close to the coherent state in principle, resembling classical radiation from a charged particle moving in a large size orbit. We note in passing that there is no chance of seeing the discreteness of emission in the gravitational case, in contrast to the case of a single atomic system, because one remains in the very high quantum number situation even at the point of coalescence since the 'Bohr radius' in this case, of order 2 / GM3, is much smaller than even the Planck length.

A brief discussion about the corrections to this scenario arising from finite size effects, tidal distortions, relativistic effects, spin etc. is in order. All these aspects affect the time evolution of the orbit and therefore the amplitude and the frequency of the gravitational waves. In the classical theory this is handled by perturbation theory by suitably adding relevant post-Newtonian terms. This changes only the effective potential of the problem, perturbatively, but neither the fundamental quadrupolar nature of the weak emission nor the fact that the energy levels are quantized. The fundamental relation E = ω for the emitted quanta remains valid at each instant, with ω only perturbatively different from the simple Newtonian situation. Hence, none of these corrections affect the picture of emission of a large number of quanta at nearly constant frequency and constant probability factors in equation (6) when we consider time intervals that are orders of magnitude smaller than the orbital frequency Ω. Even in the smallest imaginable duration comparable to Planck time, millions of quanta are emitted from an early binary system because the average [formula] is given by P(ω) / ω. Hence, all time dependence can be neglected for the derivation of the coherent state emission from the binary system and the equations (6-10) remain fully valid. Slow time dependences will then be reflected in the slow variation of ω, the amplitude operator of the field Êg and in the overall spectrum of the emitted gravitational waves. In other words, the familiar post-Newtonian and tidal corrections will be reflected in the expectation value of the waveform in the quantum treatment, in accordance with the Ehrenfest theorem.

Many phenomena in quantum optics have their expectation values exactly matching results of semi-classical optics, in which light is considered as classical waves and matter is fully quantized.  The celebrated optical equivalence theorem [\cite=ecg1] guarantees this equivalence when the relevant operator functions are normal ordered, with all the creation operators arranged to the left of the annihilation operators.  In other words, what we call classical light is in fact quantum light with certain specific relationships to the matter that generates it.  The quantum-gravitational optical equivalence involving gravitational waves and their matter sources and detectors implies that the results of the full theory of quantum gravity in its radiation sector with observables represented by normal ordered operators will in fact be identical to the results in semiclassical gravity.  This insight is a substantial improvement over the current situation with no theory of quantum gravity, to a phase where we can rely on a limited theory of quantum gravity for phenomena involving gravitational waves and matter in arbitrary quantum states. What is perhaps excluded in such a framework are those quantum states of space-time where the characteristic nonlinear nature of the gravitational interaction would play a role.

We now summarize the main results of quantum-gravitational optics.

1) Gravitational waves from a single massive binary system obeying ordinary quantum mechanics is in a quantum coherent state.

2) Representation of arbitrary graviton states in a diagonal coherent state representation [\cite=ecg1]: It is indeed remarkable that we already know how to represent the arbitrary quantum states of quantized gravitational radiation in a complete theory of quantum gravity - since the coherent states [formula] are quantum mechanical [\cite=glauber] and overcomplete, any quantum state (density matrix) of gravitational radiation can be represented in a diagonal coherent state representation [\cite=ecg1],

[formula]

with [formula] and [formula] where φ(α) are real distribution functions (and not operators). This brings out the important feature of quantum gravitational optics and quantum gravity, as in familiar quantum optics, that all radiation states are quantum states.

3) The gravito-optical equivalence theorem, detection and correlations: The emission and detection of gravitational waves are described in quantum gravity with non-commuting creation and annihilation operators, symbolically written here as [formula] and a.  The diagonal coherent state representation [\cite=ecg1] implies that for all instances of gravitational radiation and detection, the quantum gravity prediction for expectation values of general normal ordered operator functions agrees exactly with the semi-classical prediction combining the quantum theory of matter and the theory of classical gravitational waves. This in most cases is the general relativistic prediction itself, since the quantum nature of matter is not important in cases of coherent detection.  The operator for the intensity of detected waves, for example, has the form Ê( - )Ê( + ), where Ê( + ) is the positive frequency part of the quantized gravitational radiation field, and the relevant operator function [formula] is normal ordered.  The first order and second order coherence functions, convenient for characterizing the quantum nature of the radiation, are also normal ordered operator functions and what we already know about 'classical' coherence theory has to be matched exactly by a theory of quantum gravity.  This is a powerful and useful indicator to the theory of quantum gravity.

4) Correspondence principle: The general formulation of quantum gravitational optics in terms of the diagonal coherent state representation is exact and does not invoke approximations that depend on the relative magnitude of physical quantities in comparison with either the Planck quantities or the quantum mechanical action involved in the problem. Our demonstration that a quantum coherent state is radiated from a single gravitationally bound massive binary system allows one to see the approach towards classical correspondence clearly, maintaining consistency of the applicability of quantum theory to large and massive systems.  However, the matter sector, with its 'successful' quantum theory, usually needs such comparisons to talk about correspondence with the classical world.  In this sense, the gravitational radiation sector seems to be fully quantum mechanical already and the problems that we face today to formulate a plausible theory of quantum gravity might entirely be in the matter sector!

Having highlighted the main features of quantum gravitational optics, we suggest that a fresh look at constructing the theory of quantum gravity may be taken starting from these reliable and fully quantum gravitational results in the radiation sector of gravity.
