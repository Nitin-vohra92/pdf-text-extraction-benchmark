Lucas Numbers with the Lehmer property

Introduction

Let φ(n) be the Euler function of a positive integer n. Recall that if n has the prime factorization

[formula]

then

[formula]

Lehmer [\cite=Leh] conjectured that if φ(n)|n - 1 then n is a prime. To this day, the conjecture remains open. Counterexamples to Lehmer's conjecture have been dubbed Lehmer numbers. Several people worked on getting larger and larger lower bounds on a potential Lehmer number. For a positive integer m, we write ω(m) for the number of distinct prime factors of m. Lehmer himself proved that if N is Lehmer, then ω(N)  ≥  7. This has been improved by Cohen and Hagis [\cite=coh] to ω(N)  ≥  14. The current record ω(N)  ≥  15 is due to Renze [\cite=joh]. If additionally 3|N, then ω(N)  ≥  40  ·  106 and N > 1036  ·  107.

Not succeeding in proving that there are no Lehmer numbers, some researchers have settled for the more modest goal of proving that there are no Lehmer numbers in certain interesting subsequences of positive integers. For example, in [\cite=FL1], Luca proved that there is no Fibonacci number which is Lehmer. In [\cite=GL], it is shown that there is no Lehmer number in the sequence of Cullen numbers {Cn}n  ≥  1 of general term Cn = n2n + 1, while in [\cite=Dajune] the same conclusion is shown to hold for generalized Cullen numbers. In [\cite=L1], it is shown that there is no Lehmer number of the form (gn - 1) / (g - 1) for any n  ≥  1 and integer g∈[2,1000].

Here, we apply the same argument as in [\cite=FL1], to the Lucas sequence companion of the Fibonacci sequence given by L0 = 2,L1 = 1 and Ln + 2 = Ln + 1 + Ln for all [formula]. Putting [formula] for the two roots of the characteristic equation x2 - x - 1 = 0 of the Lucas sequence, the Binet formula

[formula]

There are several relations among Fibonacci and Lucas numbers which are well-known and can be proved using the Binet formula ([\ref=eq:1]) for the Lucas numbers and its analog

[formula]

for the Fibonacci numbers. Some of them which are useful for us are

[formula]

[formula]

whereas for odd n

[formula]

Our result is the following:

There is no Lehmer number in the Lucas sequence.

Proof

Assume that Ln is Lehmer for some n. Clearly, Ln is odd and ω(Ln)  ≥  15 by the main result from [\cite=joh]. The product of the first 15 odd primes exceeds 1.6  ×  1019, so n  ≥  92. Furthermore,

[formula]

If n is even, formula ([\ref=eq:2]) shows that Ln - 1 = L2n / 2 + 1 or L2n / 2 - 3 and numbers of the form m2 + 1 or m2 - 3 for some integer m are never multiples of 4, so divisibility ([\ref=eq:15]) is impossible. If [formula], relations ([\ref=eq:3]) and ([\ref=eq:15]) show that 215|L(n + 1) / 2L(n - 1) / 2. This is also impossible since no member of the Lucas sequence is a multiple of 8, fact which can be easily proved by listing its first 14 members modulo 8:

[formula]

and noting that we have already covered the full period of {Lm}m  ≥  0 modulo 8 (of length 12) without having reached any zero.

So, we are left with the case when [formula]

Let us write

[formula]

with [formula] odd primes and [formula] positive integers. If p1 = 3, then Ln is even, which is not the case. Thus, p1  ≥  5.

Here, we use the argument from [\cite=FL1] to bound p1. Since most of the details are similar, we only sketch the argument. Let p be any prime factor of Ln. Reducing formula ([\ref=eq:1]) modulo p we get that [formula]. In particular, 5 is a quadratic residue modulo p, so by Quadratic Reciprocity also p is a quadratic residue modulo 5. Now let d be any divisor of n which is a multiple of p1. By Carmichael's Primitive Divisor Theorem for the Lucas numbers (see [\cite=RD]), there exists a primitive prime pd|Ld, such that [formula] for all positive d1 < d. Since n is odd and d|n, we have Ld|Ln, therefore pd|Ln. Since pd is primitive for Ld and a quadratic residue modulo 5, we have [formula] (if p were not a quadratic residue modulo 5, then we would have had that [formula], which is less useful for our problem). In particular,

[formula]

Collecting the above divisibilities ([\ref=eq:p1]) over all divisors d of n which are multiples of p1 and using ([\ref=eq:3]), we have

[formula]

In the above, τ(m) is the number of divisors of m. If p1 = 5, then 5|n, therefore [formula] because a Fibonacci number Fm is a multiple of 5 if and only if its index m is a multiple of 5. Thus, τ(n / p1) = 1, so n = p1, which is impossible since n > 92.

Assume now that p1 > 5. Since

[formula]

divisibility relation ([\ref=eq:5]) shows that pτ(n / p1)1 divides F(n + ε) / 2 for some ε∈{  ±  1}. Let z(p1) be the order of appearance of p1 in the Fibonacci sequence, which is the minimal positive integer [formula] such that [formula]. Write

[formula]

where mp1 is coprime to p1. It is known that p1|Fk if and only if z(p1)|k. Furthermore, if pt1|Fk for some t > ep1, then necessarily p1|k. Since for us (n + ε) / 2 is not a multiple of p1 (because n is a multiple of p1), we get that τ(n / p1)  ≤  ep1. In particular, if p1 = 7, then ep1 = 1, so n = p1, which is false since n > 92. So, p1  ≥  11. We now follow along the argument from [\cite=FL1] to get that

[formula]

Further, since (Ln - 1) / φ(Ln) is an integer larger than 1, we have

[formula]

or

[formula]

Letting for a divisor d of n the notation Pd stand for the set of primitive prime factors of Ld, the argument from [\cite=FL1] gives

[formula]

Since the function x  ↦  ( log  log x) / x is decreasing for x > 10 and all divisors d > 1 of n satisfy d > 10, we have, using ([\ref=eq:30]), that

[formula]

which together with inequality ([\ref=eq:4]) leads to

[formula]

The above inequality ([\ref=eq:9]) implies p1 < 1800. Since p1 < 1014, a calculation of McIntosh and Roettger [\cite=MC] shows that ep1 = 1. Thus, τ(n / p1) = 1, therefore n = p1. Since n  ≥  92, we have p1  ≥  97. Going back to the inequalities ([\ref=eq:4]) and ([\ref=eq:imp]), we get

[formula]

which is false for p1  ≥  97. The theorem is proved.
