The stable cohomology of the Satake compactification of Ag

The theorem

Assigning to two principally polarized abelian varieties their product defines a morphism Ag  ×  Ag'  →  Ag + g' (we work here over the complex field and in what follows, the topology is the Hausdorff topology). If we denote by [formula] the Satake-Baily-Borel compactification, then this morphism extends to these compactifications: we have a commutative diagram

[formula]

By taking g' = 1 and choosing a point of A1, we get the 'stabilization maps'

[formula]

whose homotopy type does not depend on the point we choose, for A1 is isomorphic to the affine line and hence connected. Since we are only concerned with homotopy classes and commutativity up to homotopy, we can for the definition of the map [formula] even choose this point to be represented by the singleton A0. Then this map is a homeomorphism onto the Satake boundary (since [formula] the maps are not just homotopic, but even induce the same map on Chow groups). This gives rise to two Hopf algebras with a mixed Hodge structure. We begin with the following lemma, which in essence is merely quoting work of Borel and Borel-Serre.

The stabilization maps defined above [formula] (multiplication by a fixed elliptic curve) and [formula] (mapping onto the boundary) induce on rational cohomology an isomorphism in degree < g and are injective in degree g.

Since the [formula]-rank of [formula] is g, this first assertion follows from a theorem of Borel [\cite=borel:stable1]. The second stability assertion is equivalent to the vanishing of the relative cohomology [formula] for k  ≤  g. But [formula] can be identified with [formula] and according to Borel-Serre [\cite=borelserre:stable] the latter space is zero in degrees ≤  g.

We then form the stable rational cohomology spaces

[formula]

where the notation is only suggestive, for there is here no pretense of introducing spaces A∞ and [formula]. If we take the direct sum over k we get a [formula]-algebra in either case. It follows from the homotopy commutativity of the diagram ([\ref=eqn:stable]) above that the inclusions jg define a graded [formula]-algebra homomorphism

[formula]

The multiplication maps exhibited in diagram ([\ref=eqn:monoid]) are (almost by definition) compatible with the stabilization maps and hence induce a graded coproducts on either algebra so that j*∞ becomes a homomorphism of (graded bicommutative) Hopf algebras. Since the multiplication maps and the stability maps are morphisms in the category of complex algebraic varieties, these Hopf algebras come with a natural mixed Hodge structure such that j*∞ is also a morphism in the mixed Hodge category. The Hopf algebra [formula] is well-known and due to Borel [\cite=borel:stable1]: it has as its primitive elements the odd Chern classes [formula], [formula] (ck restricts to Ag as the kth rational Chern class of the Hodge bundle on Ag) and so [formula] with ck of type (k,k). The principal and essentially only result of this paper is Theorem [\ref=thm:main] below. Its first assertion is due Charney and Lee [\cite=charneylee:satake], who derive this from a determination of a limit of homotopy types. We shall obtain this in a relatively elementary manner from the algebraic geometry and the classical vanishing results of Borel and Borel-Serre. Our approach has the advantage that it helps us to understand the new classes that appear here geometrically, to the extent that this enables us to determine their Hodge type. We address the homotopy discussion of Charney and Lee and a generalization thereof in another paper [\cite=chen-looijenga] that will not be used here.

The graded Hopf algebra [formula] has for every positive integer a primitive generator yr of degree 4r + 2 and for every odd positive integer a primitive generator r of degree 2r such that the map [formula] sends r to cr and is zero on yr. The mixed Hodge structure on [formula] is such that yr is of bidegree (0,0) and r of bidegree (r,r).

This theorem implies that the primitive part of the Hopf algebra [formula] is two-dimensional in degree 4r + 2 and defines a Tate extension

[formula]

with [formula] spanned by yr and [formula] spanned by c2r + 1. We discuss the nature of this extension briefly in Remark [\ref=rem:tate2] below.

The proof

The topological identification of the Satake boundary [formula] with [formula] gives rise to the decomposition [formula] so that for r  ≤  g, the natural morphism [formula] is injective and a normalization of its image [formula]. Since we are only concerned with topological issues, we often identify [formula] with its image in [formula].

We will use the fact that the higher direct images [formula] are locally constant on each stratum Ar. The stalk of this restriction can be identified with the rational cohomology algebra of the arithmetic group Pg(r) defined as follows. Let H stand for [formula] (with basis denoted (e,e')) and endowed with symplectic form characterized by 〈e,e'〉 = 1. We also put [formula]. We regard Hg as a direct sum of symplectic lattices. Then Pg(r) is in terms of the decomposition [formula], the group of symplectic transformations in Hg that are the identity on [formula] and preserve [formula]. The orbifold fundamental group of Ar is isomorphic to [formula] (the isomorphism is of course given up to conjugacy) and its representation on a stalk of [formula] corresponds to its obvious action (given by conjugation) on Pg(r). Note that this action is algebraic in the sense that it extends to a representation of the algebraic group [formula] underlying [formula]. If p∈Ar and Up is a regular neighborhood of p in [formula] such that the natural map [formula] is an isomorphism, then for every r  ≤  s  ≤  g and [formula] the restriction map yields a map of [formula]-algebras [formula]. Under the above identification this is represented by the [formula]-orbit of the obvious inclusion [formula]. Similarly, the natural sheaf homomorphism

[formula]

(we invoked the Künneth isomorphism) is at Ar  ×  Ar'  ⊂  Ag  ×  Ag' induced by the obvious embedding [formula], or rather its [formula]-orbit.

The proof of the first assertion of our main theorem rests on careful study of the Leray spectral sequence for the inclusion [formula],

[formula]

Let r  ≤  g. Then the natural map [formula] is an isomorphism for p < r and is injective for p = r.

It suffices to show that when r < g, the natural map [formula] has this property. For this we consider the exact sequence

[formula]

The restriction [formula] is a local system whose monomdromy comes from an action of the algebraic group [formula]. Following Borel [\cite=borel:stable2], [formula] then vanishes in degree ≤  r. The lemma follows.

By viewing Ig - r as the subquotient [formula] of Hg, we see that there is a natural homomorphism of arithmetic groups [formula].

The homomorphism [formula] induces an isomorphism on rational cohomology in degrees [formula]. In that range the rational cohomology of [formula] is stable and is canonically isomorphic to the stable cohomology of [formula]. The inclusion Pg(r)  ×  Pg'(r')  ⊂  Pg + g'(r + r') induces on rational cohomology in the stable range (relative to both factors) the coproduct in the Hopf algebra [formula].

According to Borel [\cite=borel:stable2], the cohomology of the arithmetic group [formula] with values in an irreducible representation of the underlying algebraic group [formula] (the group of invertible matrices of determinant ±  1) is zero in degree [formula], unless the representation is trivial. Let Ng(r) be the kernel of [formula]. This is a nilpotent subgroup whose center, when written additively, may be identified with the symmetric quotient [formula] of [formula]. The quotient of Ng(r) by this center is abelian, and when written additively, naturally identified with the lattice [formula]. So in view of the Leray spectral sequence

[formula]

it suffices to show that [formula] does not contain the trivial representation of [formula] in positive degree [formula]. This follows from another Leray spectral sequence

[formula]

The left hand side is isomorphic to

[formula]

as a representation of [formula]. The classical invariant theory of [formula] tells us that this representation does not contain the trivial representation when 0 < s + 2t < g - r and so the first part lemma follows. The second assertion merely quotes a theorem of Borel [\cite=borel:stable1] and the last assertion is easy.

For [formula], [formula] is a constant local system whose stalk is canonically isomorphic to [formula]. This identification is compatible with the multiplicative structure. It is also compatible with the coproduct in the sense that when 0  ≤  r'  ≤  g', then in degree [formula], the natural map [formula] is stalkwise identified with the coproduct on [formula].

We have shown (Lemma [\ref=lemma:stable1] and Corollary [\ref=cor:stable2]) that when p < r and [formula] we have

[formula]

The Leray spectral sequences ([\ref=eqn:ss]) for jg * and jg + 1  * are compatible and so we may form a limit: we fix p and q, but we let r and g - r tend to infinity. This then yields a spectral sequence

[formula]

This spectral sequence is not just multiplicative, but also compatible with the coproduct. So for each r  ≥  2, [formula] is a bigraded differential Hopf algebra with its primitive generators in [formula]. In particular, the differentials will map primitive elements to primitive elements or to zero.

A theorem of Borel [\cite=borel:stable1] tells us that the Hopf algebra [formula] is the exterior algebra which has for every positive integer a primitive generator ar in degree 4r + 1. On the other hand we know that [formula] with deg (cs) = 2s. Since ar has odd degree, it must die in the spectral sequence. So [formula] for [formula], but [formula] will be nonzero and primitive. We also see that for s > 0 odd, [formula] must contain a lift s of cs. Since [formula] is a Hopf algebra, it then follows that [formula], as asserted.

The spectral sequence ([\ref=eqn:ssinfty]) suggests that the space A∞ (which we did not define) has the homotopy type of a [formula]-bundle over [formula] (which we did not define either). Indeed, the contents of [\cite=charneylee:satake] amounts to proving this in some form.

The long exact sequence for the pair [formula] shows that the cohomology [formula] stabilizes as well with g and is equal to the ideal in [formula] generated by the yr's. We shall therefore denote this ideal by [formula]. We take the occasion to point out that the y-classes are canonically defined, but that this is not at all clear for the c-classes (for more on this, see Remark [\ref=rem:tate2]).

We can account geometrically for the classes yr as follows. Denote the single point of [formula] by ∞   (the worst cusp of [formula]), and take g so large that the natural maps [formula] and [formula] are isomorphisms. Choose a regular neighborhood U∞ of ∞   in [formula] so that if we put [formula], the natural maps

[formula]

are also isomorphisms. If we identify [formula] with its image in [formula], then [formula] is precisely the image of yr under the restriction map [formula].

We may also get a homology class this way: the Hopf algebra [formula] has a primitive generator in [formula] that is dual to ar and if we represent this generator as (4r + 1)-cycle Ar in [formula], then Ar bounds both in U∞ (almost canonically) and in Ag (not canonically). The two bounding (4r + 2)-chains make up a (4r + 2)-cycle in [formula] whose class [formula] pairs nontrivially with the image of yr in [formula].

In view of Remark [\ref=rem:classconstruction] it is enough to show that the image of [formula] in the stalk [formula] has weight zero. For this we will need a toroidal resolution of U∞ as described in [\cite=amrt], but we will try to get by with the minimal input necessary (for a somewhat more detailed review of this construction one may consult [\cite=chen-looijenga]).

Consider the symmetric quotient [formula] of [formula] and regard it as a lattice in the space [formula] of quadratic forms on [formula]. The positive definite quadratic forms make up a cone [formula] that is open and convex and is as such spanned by its intersection with [formula]. Let C+g  ⊃  Cg be the convex cone spanned by [formula]; this is just the set of semipositive quadratic forms on [formula] whose kernel is spanned by its intersection with [formula]. The obvious action of [formula] on [formula] preserves both cones and is proper on Cg.

Consider the algebraic torus [formula]. If we apply the 'log norm' [formula] to the first tensor factor, we get a [formula]-equivariant homomorphism [formula] with kernel the compact torus [formula] . We denote by Tg  ⊂  Tg the preimage of Cg so that we have defined a proper [formula]-equivariant homomorphism of semigroups [formula]. Since [formula] acts properly on Cg it does so on Tg and hence the orbit space [formula] has the structure of a complex-analytic orbifold. There is an natural extension of [formula] in the complex analytic category (it is in fact the Stein hull of [formula] in case g > 1) that comes with a distinguished point that we will (for good reasons) also denote by ∞   such that [formula] is open-dense in V and [formula] is topologically the open cone over a pair of spaces with vertex ∞  . It has the property that there exists an open embedding of U∞ in V that takes ∞   to ∞   and identifies U∞ with a regular neighborhood of ∞   in V in such a way that [formula]. This justifies that we focus on the triple [formula]. All else we need to now about V is that the toroidal extension of [formula] that we are about to consider provides a resolution of V as an orbifold.

The universal cover of Tr is contractible (with covering group [formula]) and hence the universal cover of [formula] as an orbifold is also contractible and has covering group [formula] (it is in fact a virtual classifying space for this group). Similarly, the orbit space, [formula] exists as a real-analytic orbifold and is a virtual classifying space for [formula]. The map [formula] induces a projection [formula] and the classes that concern us lie in the image of

[formula]

A nonsingular admissible decomposition of C+g is a collection {σ}σ∈Σ of closed cones in C+g, each of which is spanned by a partial basis of [formula], such that the collection is closed under 'taking faces' and 'taking intersections' and whose relative interiors are pairwise disjoint with union C+g. Let Σ be such a decomposition that is also [formula]-invariant and is fine enough in the sense that every [formula]-orbit in Cg+ meets every member of Σ in at most one point. Such decompositions exist [\cite=amrt]. The associated torus embedding Tg  ⊂  TΣg is then nonsingular and comes with an action of [formula]. We denote by TΣg the interior of the closure of Tg in TΣg. This is an open [formula]-invariant subset of TΣg on which [formula] acts properly so that [formula] exists as an analytic orbifold. It is of the type alluded to above: we have a natural proper morphism f:VΣ  →  V that is complex-algebraic over V and is an isomorphism over [formula]. Moreover, the exceptional set is a simple normal crossing divisor in the orbifold sense.

As for every torus embedding there is also a real counterpart in the sense that [formula] extends in a [formula]-equivariant manner to a proper and surjective map [formula], where CΣg is a certain stratified locally compact Hausdorff space which contains Cg as an open dense subset. In the present case CΣg is simply a manifold with corners, because Σ is nonsingular. The strata of CΣg are indexed by Σ, with the stratum defined by σ being the image of Cg under the projection along the real subspace of [formula] spanned by σ. So each stratum of CΣg appears as a convex open subset of some vector space and it is all of this vector space precisely when the relative interior of σ is contained Cg. This is also equivalent to the stratum having compact closure in CΣg.

Let us call a wall of CΣg, the closure of a stratum defined by a ray (=   a one-dimensional member) of Σ. So a wall is compact if and only if the associated ray lies in [formula]. We denote by [formula] the union of these compact walls. This is a closed subset of CΣg and its covering by such compact walls is a Leray covering: the covering is locally finite and each nonempty intersection is contractible (and is in fact the closure of a stratum). Its nerve is easily expressed in terms of Σ. Let us say that a member of Σ is proper if it is contained in [formula]. The proper members of Σ make up a subset [formula] that is also closed under 'taking faces' and 'taking intersections' and their union makes up a [formula]-invariant cone contained in [formula]. If we projectivize that cone we get a simplicial complex in the real projective space of [formula] that we denote by [formula]. A vertex of [formula] corresponds of course to a ray of [formula] and this in turn defines a compact wall of CΣg. In this way [formula] can be identified in a [formula]-equivariant manner with the nerve complex of the covering of [formula] by the compact walls of CΣg. A standard argument shows that we have a [formula]-equivariant homotopy equivalence between [formula] and the nerve [formula] of this covering.

Each stratum closure in CΣg can be retracted in a canonical manner onto its intersection with [formula] and we thus find a [formula]-equivariant deformation retraction [formula]. This shows at the same time that the inclusion Cg  ⊂  CΣg is a [formula]-equivariant homotopy equivalence. So if we put [formula] and [formula], then we end up with homotopy equivalences [formula]. We also have a homotopy equivalence [formula].

Taking the preimage under [formula] makes walls of CΣg correspond to irreducible components of the toric boundary [formula] and a wall of CΣg is compact if and only if the associated irreducible component is. So the preimage [formula] of [formula] is the union of the compact irreducible components of the toric boundary. It is clear that [formula] is also the nerve of the covering of [formula] by its irreducible components. The image of [formula] in V (in other words, its [formula]-orbit space) is the normal crossing divisor f- 1(  ∞  ). The inclusion f- 1(  ∞  )  ⊂  VΣ is also a deformation retract. So in the commutative diagram

[formula]

the inclusion on the top right and those at the bottom are homotopy equivalences. It follows that the composite map in diagram ([\ref=eqn:classmap]) factors through the rational cohomology of IΣg and hence also through the rational cohomology of VΣ and that the nonzero classes in [formula] that we thus obtain come from the nerve of the covering of f- 1(  ∞  ) by its irreducible components. Such classes are known to be of weight zero [\cite=deligne:hodge3].

Goresky and Pardon [\cite=goresky-pardon] have constructed a lift cGPr of the real Chern class [formula] to [formula]. Spencer Bloch and the second author [\cite=bloch-looijenga] recently proved that cGPr lies in [formula]. So the class of the Tate extension in Remark [\ref=rem:tate1] is up to a rational number given by the value of cGP2r + 1 on the class [formula] found in Remark [\ref=rem:classconstruction] (two choices of zr differ by a class of the form jg  *(w) with [formula] and cGP2r + 1 takes on such a class the rational value c2r + 1(w)). Arvind Nair, after learning of our theorem, informed us that his techniques enable him to show that this extension class is nonzero (and is given by a rational multiple of ζ(2r + 1)).
