Integer spin resonance crossing at VEPP-4M with conservation of beam polarization

Motivation

A set of the beam energy values in the Hadron-Muon Branching Ratio measurement with the KEDR detector [\cite=KEDR] at the electron-positron VEPP-M collider [\cite=VEPP-4M] in the region between J / ψ and ψ(2S) resonances includes several critical points. In particular, E = 1764 MeV and 1814 MeV. Since the beam energy calibration in this experiment is performed with the Resonant Depolarization technique (RD) so polarized beams are required. Polarization is obtained due to the natural radiative mechanism at the VEPP-3 booster storage ring. Both mentioned energy values are in the so-called 'Polarization Downfall' -   the VEPP-3 energy range of approximately 160 MeV width where obtaining of the polarization of a fairly high degree is significantly hampered because of strong depolarization effect of the guide field imperfections. The 'Polarization Downfall' range was found in the 2003 year experiment with the polarimeter based on the internal polarized target [\cite=DYUG].

The center of that critical range is the energy value E4 = 1763 MeV which corresponds to the integer spin resonance ν  =  νk = 4 (in the conventional storage rings ν  =  γa is the spin tune parameter equal to a number of the spin vector precessions about the vertical guide field axis per a turn subtracting one; γ is the Lorentz factor; a = (g - 2) / 2 ). Nevertheless, one can obtain polarized beams at VEPP-4M with the energies from the 'Polarization Downfall' excepting a small island in the vicinity of E4 if using the method of 'auxiliary energy point'. In the given experiment the magnetization cycle of the collider is of the 'upper' type. It means that the 'auxiliary energy points' should be below the energies of experiment as well as below 1660 MeV taking into account the 'Polarization Downfall' region lower boundary. In the cases when the method is valid the beam polarization in VEPP-3 is achieved at the 'auxiliary' energy. Then the beam is injected into the collider ring. After that its energy is raised to the energy of experiment. Radiative spin relaxation time in the collider ring is two orders larger than that in the booster (τp  ≈  80 h at E = 1.8 GeV at VEPP-4M). This allows us to use the beam polarization in the RD energy calibration procedures even at a rather small detuning from the dangerous spin resonances. For instance, the RD calibrations of the beam energy in the tau-lepton mass measurement experiment [\cite=TAU] at energies close to the tau production threshold (E = 1777 MeV) were carried out with a delay of about half an hour after injection of the beam at the detuning δν  ≈  0.03 from the resonance νk = 4 (ΔE  ≈  13 MeV in the energy scale) and less. In the case under consideration one can apply the described method at the energy points below 1763 MeV at the detuning of ΔE  ≈  9  ÷  13 MeV as the tau mass measurement experiment. But there are the special additional measures required for the point E = 1814 MeV and, apparently, for the points somewhat below the ψ(2S) peak energy (for example. 1839 MeV). The reason is the necessity to cross the integer spin resonance at 1763 MeV during acceleration starting from the 'auxiliary' energy.

Inability of fast or slow crossing of the spin resonance

Fast change of the beam energy in a storage ring (during acceleration or deceleration) enables the polarization of particles to be preserved when crossing any spin resonance ν0  =  νk (in a general case the spin tune ν0 is not coincident with the definition given above for the storage rings with an unidirectional guide field) if the following condition is fulfilled [\cite=DERB]:

[formula]

ε(t) = |ν0(t) - νk| is a time-dependent resonant detuning; wk is a resonant harmonic amplitude of the field perturbations; ω0 is an angular frequency of particle revolution. For instance, in the tau-mass measurement experiment the rate of change of the detuning during the beam energy lowering down to the tau-production threshold was dE / dt  ≈  1 Mev/  s or [formula] s- 1. Since the intersection of the combination spin resonances ν + mνx + nνy = k, m,n =   ±  1,  ±  2..., with consideration of the betatron tunes, was successful (as proven by the fact of the RD energy calibrations in the final state), then the likely power of each of these minor resonances was significantly less than the amount |wk|2  ~  2  ×  10- 5 (ω0 = 2πf0, f0 = 819 kHz). The data on measurement of the polarization lifetime τd due to radiative depolarization at E = 1777 MeV, the tau-lepton production threshold, gives the information about the natural power of the spin resonance νk  =  ν = 4 related to the sources of the vertical closed orbit perturbations. The polarization lifetime was adjusted to the level τd  ≥  1 hour [\cite=DYUG]. One can associate this quantity with the formal estimate of the resonant spin harmonic amplitude using the known equation [\cite=DERB2] [\cite=Derbenev:1973ia]:

[formula]

where ε  =  ν0 - 4  ≈  0.03  ≪  1 , τp is the Sokolov-Ternov polarization time [\cite=SokolovTernov]. For VEPP-4M at E = 1777 MeV τp = 87 hours, τd = 1 hour, ε  ≈  0.03, so the estimate |wk|  ~  2.8  ×  10- 3 is obtained. Therefore, the maximal necessary rate of the resonance crossing is [formula] s- 1, or, dE / dt  ≫  104 MeV/s. In practice, the maximal rate of the VEPP-4M energy change without any notable losses of particles usually does not exceed 5 MeV/s. So, a fast crossing of the integer spin resonance E = 1763 MeV is impossible.

Otherwise, if [\cite=DERB] [\cite=DERB2]

[formula]

then a spin resonance occurs adiabatically (slowly). Basing on the estimates made above, one can conclude that the rate of energy change of [formula] MeV/s, in principle, may be appropriate. In the theory of adiabatic crossing of the spin resonances the polarization has a chance to survive when (3) is fulfilled and it reverses a sign as a result of the crossing. Despite the feasibility of the condition of slow crossing, it is necessary to bear in mind that there is a lower limit on the rate of the crossing due to the depolarizing effect of radiative diffusion and friction. Radiative depolarization time related to the vertical closed orbit distortions declines very quickly when decreasing the detuning from the integer spin resonance: [formula]. For example, this time decreases as 16 times at E = 1770 MeV as compared with the value τd = 1 h at E = 1777 MeV. In the case of high power resonance the spin diffusion depends also on a decrement Λ, the parameter of radiative friction. In the resonant area where |ε|  ~  |wk| and in the case ω0|wk|  ≫  Λ the depolarization time owing to radiative diffusion and friction achieves a minimal value τd  ~  Λ- 1  ~  100 msec. Given estimates [\cite=Nikitin-BINP-2015-1] allow us to infer that an adiabatic crossing the integer spin resonance at E = 1763 MeVas well as the fast crossing discussed above will result in a loss of the beam polarization.

Detuning from integer spin resonance due to the KEDR field decompensation

The simple method to preserve the VEPP-4M beam polarization in the conditions under consideration has been proposed and numerically substantiated in [\cite=Nikitin-BINP-2015-1] basing on some features of the KEDR detector magnetic system. Two cases of the polarization kinematics in the storage rings at the energy of an integer spin resonance ν = 4 are clarified in Fig. [\ref=fig:Vect]. If one switches off the current in the anti-solenoid coils, the 0.6 Tesla KEDR detector longitudinal magnetic field integral becomes un-compensated that results in the spin and velocity rotation angle of about 0.34 rad at E = 1.75 GeV. This causes a shift of the spin tune with regard to an unperturbed value ν. The latter is proportional to the beam energy and describes a spin precession in the storage ring with a flat closed orbit. Thus, a non-integer part of the perturbed spin frequency ν0 does not accept a null value at the critical point near E  =  1763 MeV. This fact is used as a basis for the proposal to preserve the beam polarization during acceleration.

The equilibrium polarization axis as a function of an azimuth in a storage ring containing the insertion with longitudinal magnetic field is calculated using the known formulae [\cite=Derbenev:1978hv] [\cite=NikSaldin]:

[formula]

Here

[formula]

is an angle of electron spin rotation in the longitudinal magnetic field with the integral of [formula] in Tesla·  meter. The symbols x,y,z denote the horizontal, longitudinal and vertical orts of the movable coordinate basis, respectively. We use an approximation of the isomagnetic storage ring in which the azimuth ϑ can be considered as equal to the angle of a particle velocity rotation (ϑ = 0 at the solenoid location). The effective spin precession tune is determined from an equation

[formula]

In our case [formula], where HKEDR = 0.6 Tesla, the KEDR detector field; an effective KEDR solenoid length Leff = 3.3 m if the anti-solenoids are switched off (and Leff = 2.5 m in the case of full compensation of the detector field integral). Fig. [\ref=fig:Tune] shows that the calculated spin tune shift [formula] makes about ΔE  ≈  18 MeV in the vicinity of the critical energy 1763 MeV at full decompensation that is two times larger than the minimal detuning (9 MeV), which took a place in the RD calibrations of beam energy in the tau-mass measurement experiment.

Radiative depolarization rate during acceleration

Characteristic time of the radiative depolarization τd due to quantum fluctations in the presence of a strong perturbation in the form of the KEDR detector longitudinal field can be found from the generalized equation [\cite=Derbenev:1973ia]:

[formula]

Here τp is the Sokolov-Ternov polarization time (it is proportional to E- 5 and makes up 72 hours at the VEPP-4M energy of 1.85 GeV ); [formula] is a square of the spin-orbit coupling vector function perodically depending on the azimuth. In our case the spin-orbit coupling is excited by an uncompensated part of the KEDR field integral. It can be defined as a derivative of the polarization axis vector [formula] (4) with respect to the particle Lorentz-factor γ [\cite=NikSaldin]:

[formula]

Another contribution to a spin-orbit coupling is given by betatron oscillations excited by SR fluctuations. Besides an integer spin resonance this coupling relates to combination spin resonances with betatron tunes νx,z, in particular, of the type ν  ±  νx,z = kx,z in the linear approximation (kx,z are integer). When considering the case of a significant integral of longitudinal magnetic field the betatron contribution to the depolarization rate near an integer spin resonance turns to be small as compared with a similar effect of the polarization axis "chromatism" [\cite=NikSaldin] [\cite=NikCtau] [\cite=NikRupac]. By this reason we neglect the betatron oscillation effect in our estimate of the spin radiative kinetics.

The depolarization time is calculated using the formula (6) and is plotted in Fig. [\ref=fig:Time] versus the beam energy at 100% and 50% extent of decompensation of the KEDR field integral. Minimal depolarization time τd  =  10 seconds. A width of the energy area where 10 s <  τd  <  100 s is about 30 MeV. It takes time of about 30 seconds to cross this area at a nominal rate of energy change dE / dt  =  1 MeV/s.

The result shows that it is almost impossible to have time to check the presence of polarization, using RD or monitoring by the Touschek polarimeter, when the energy value E = 1764 MeV because of the expected fast depolarization in a time of about 80 seconds. At the energy of 1810 MeV the time τd becomes 2000 seconds. This gives a chance to measure the energy by a spin frequency. Theoretical behavior of the polarization degree during the process of acceleration beginning from the injection ('auxiliary') energy E = 1650 MeV with relatively safe crossing of the integer spin resonance energy at the expense of the KEDR field decompensation is shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:Degree] for two values of the acceleration rate. The current value of the degree in units of the initial one (P0) is calculated from the equation

[formula]

It is seen from the calculations that it is advantageous to apply the full decompensation of the KEDR field and accelerate with a rate not below 2 MeV/sec. At best, it can provide about 80% of the initial polarization degree in the final state. RD calibration of the beam energy should be performed only after resetting the anti-solenoid field that leads to cancelation of the spin tune shift and, with this, a systematic error in the energy value. Moreover, the polarization lifetime increases manyfold if the KEDR field is compensated.

Two skew quad compensation of betatron coupling from the KEDR field

If the anti-solenoids are switched off the special measures are needed to provide the alternative relevant operation modes of VEPP-4M at the beam injection and process of acceleration. In this case, it is convenient to use the scheme of betatron coupling localization proposed by K.Steffen [\cite=Steffen1982] and based on application of two skew quadrupole lenses (rotated by an angle of [formula]) - see Fig.5. Previously, this scheme has already been successfully tested at VEPP-4M [\cite=NikProt1999] [\cite=Nikitin:2001ej].

Transport matrix for the vector of betatron variables (x,x',z,z') at the section from the skew lens SQ+ to SQ- including KEDR can be approximately written as

[formula]

Here Q± is the 'thin' skew quad matrices; L is the empty section matrix for the length l = Ls / 4; Ls = 3.3 m, the effective length of the KEDR main solenoid (Ls = 2.5 m in the case when the anti-solenoids are switched on); Ms is the half-solenoid matrix in the 'thin magnet' approximation (χ  =  φ / 2):

[formula]

M± are the matrices for transformation from the solenoid edge to the corresponding skew quad. The skew quads are placed symmetrically relative to the solenoid at the 'magic' azimuths for which some elements of the matrix M strictly or approximately satisfy a certain equation. Strengths of the SQ± lenses are found from another equation to be proportional to χ, similar in value and opposite in sign. If you set these found skew quad strengths, then the matrix M does not contain the off-diagonal (coupling) 2x2 blocks or becomes close to such kind. The simplicity of the scheme is based on the mirror symmetry of the magnetic structure at the section with the solenoid. Betatron coupling is localized at this section. Vertical and horizontal oscillations excited beyond the section are mutually independent with the accuracy the compensation scheme is designed and made. The scheme provides a minimal split of the normal betatron mode frequencies of the order of 10- 3 (in units of the revolution frequency). If no compensation is applied, this split achieves 0.1, and this does not allow a sustainable maintenance of the beam during acceleration.

Touschek polarimeter

Relative polarization degree is measured by the Touschek polarimeter [\cite=TSH-POL-NIM-2002] [\cite=EMS-REVIEW-NIM-2009], which consists of eight plastic scintillator counters located inside the accelerator vacuum chamber. Counting rate of the Intra-Beam Scattering (IBS) depends on the beam polarization [\cite=bayer1969] [\cite=BKS] [\cite=STRAKH] [\cite=TSH-CALC-JETP-2012]. The relaxation time of polarization ('polarization lifetime') is measured by a time evolution of the scattered (Touschek) particle counting rate. Correct determination of the polarization lifetime requires taking into account the Touschek beam lifetime, the spin dependence of IBS and scattering on residual gas by solving an equation for the beam particle population N:

[formula]

Here, the first term corresponds to IBS and τtsh is the characteristic Touschek beam lifetime; the second term describes background scattering on residual gas with τbg, the characteristic background lifetime; δ(t) is the polarization contribution to IBS proportional polarization degree squared; V(t) is the beam volume.

We use a compensation technique by normalizing the counting rate from a polarized beam by the counting rate from an unpolarized one. This technique allows us to suppress some count rate fluctuations related to the beam orbit or beam size instabilities.

During the experiment the beam volume V (more precisely, the transverse beam sizes because it is assumed that the longitudinal size varies slightly), the beam current I1,2 and the count rate f1,2 for the first (polarized) and the second (unpolarized) bunches are measured. The relative count rate difference Δ  =  f1 / f2 - 1 is calculated. These experimental data are fitted using the following formulae:

[formula]

Here i = 1,2 denotes first and the second bunch; εx(t) is the factor taking into account the registration efficiency: Ie  =  ef0 is the single electron current, f0 is the revolution frequency; δ1,2(t) are the polarization contribution to the Touschek intra-beam scattering for the first and the second bunches respectively:

[formula]

Initial polarization of the first bunch P1 = 0.8 corresponding to the assumed beam state after acceleration (see Fig.4) is fixed to the calculated value due to strong correlation with the parameter of the Touschek polarization effect δ0; [formula], the equilibrium polarization degree where τp is the Sokolov-Ternov radiative polarization time (87 hours at 1777 MeV). δVi(t) is the relative beam volume as a function of time:

[formula]

The following free parameters are used for the fitting: [formula] is the polarization Touschek effect; δN  =  N1 / N2  -  1 is the relative number of particles difference in the bunches; τd is the polarization life time which is anobject of interest; τtsh  ≈  5  000  ÷  20  000 s is the Touschek life time; τbg  ≈  10  000  ÷  20  000 s is the background life time; ptsh  ≈  0.2 is a relative probability to register Touschek particles; pbg  ≈  0.05 is a relative probability to register residual gas scattered particles; I1,2(0)  ≈  2 mA are initial current of the first and the second bunches, respectively; V0 is the initial beam volume; αV  ≈  0.1%- 1 is coefficient of dependence of the beam volume on the beam current.

An evolution in time of the measured quantity Δ(t) in the conditions when the acceleration up to the target energy is just done but the compensating solenoids stay switched off can be described as follows. At the 'auxiliary energy' the ratio of the bunch currents is adjusted to a level of [formula]. This is due to the necessity to minimize a slope of the dependence Δ(t) as a whole and an associated systematic error. For this purpose we kick out portion by portion the redundant bunch particles using the VEPP-4M inflector. If the bunch current ratio mentioned above is provided then Δ(t) > 0 during all time of observation. Depolarization process is enhanced during crossing of the critical energy area and goes on after completion of the acceleration and setting of the target energy. By this reason the quantity Δ(t) grows in a positive direction by the law close to the exponential one. The characteristic time of this growth for the given target energy is calculated (see Fig.3). Polarization in the beam drops to zero and then another process becomes dominating - a relaxation due to a difference of the bunch currents. Because of a difference in the IBS beam lifetime the quantity Δ(t) begins to change in the negative direction. Asymptotically, it goes to zero.

Experimental results

The results of the RD beam energy calibration in the 'auxiliary energy' mode are presented in Fig.6. Basing on these data, one can get an idea of the magnitude of the polarization effect measured by the Touschek polarimeter, as well as its repeatability . The time allowed for the radiative polarization at the VEPP-3 booster ring at energy E = 1.65 GeV was 5000-6000 seconds at the estimated characteristic time of polarization [formula] seconds.

First of all, an efficiency of the proposed method for acceleration with crossing of the critical energy E = 1763 MeV has been tested by an observation of the beam polarization relaxation (depolarization) in the final energy mode at E  ≈  1.81 GeV. Evolution in time of the normalized Touschek electron counting rate after completion of acceleration in the case when the anti-solenoids remained switched off for all the time is shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:Rlx]. Qualitatively, the relaxation process proceeds as described in the previous section. Relaxation (depolarization) time of [formula] determined from the data in Fig. [\ref=fig:Rlx]a is in good agreement with the estimated time of about 1400 s ( Fig. [\ref=fig:Time]). Compliance with the calculation in the data in Fig. [\ref=fig:Rlx]b looks a little worse and can be explained by the influence of beam instability on a systematic error.

The fact of beam polarization preservation has been fully confirmed in the runs on the beam energy measurement by the resonant depolarization technique performed after the acceleration (Fig. [\ref=fig:Jmp1810]).

In contrast to the 'spin relaxation' runs, the storage ring mode with anti-solenoid field switched on was restored before every start of the RD procedure. This measure stops the non-resonant (radiative) depolarization process related to the contribution of strong longitudinal magnetic fields to spin-orbit coupling. An additional time of 385 seconds was required to restore the anti-solenoid field and, concurrently, to set necessary corrections in the collider magnetic structure. If the acceleration stops at the level of 1810 MeV with P / P0 = 0.81 then the relative degree falls down to 0.74 in 385 seconds.

According to the calculation, the degradation of the depolarization jump amplitude during acceleration makes about [formula]. The measured values of three jumps in Fig. [\ref=fig:Jmp1810] are in the range [formula] while the jumps measured at the 'auxiliary' energy and presented in Fig. [\ref=fig:JmpAux] make up 0.9% and 1.2%. The accumulated experience in the calibration of energy by resonant depolarization at VEPP-4M says that the stability of a beam polarization degree obtained at VEPP-3 under the same controlled conditions, is at the level of 10 - 20%. Therefore, comparing the specified data, we can conclude that the experiment and the calculation are in satisfactory quantitative agreement.

Discussion

The method to preserve an electron beam polarization at crossing of the integer spin resonance energy successfully realized and practically applied in the HEP experiment is based on the use of a longitudinal magnetic field of the detector incorporated into the storage ring structure. It differs from the well-known Siberian Snake technique which requires much greater integral of magnetic field (4.6ν Tesla×  meter) to rotate a spin of electron through an angle of [formula] around the velocity vector. The corresponding spin tune is 1 / 2 or about 220 MeV in the energy units and so a detuning from integer spin resonances is maximal at any energy. A single Siberian snake solenoid (φ  =  π) increases a radiative depolarization rate by a factor of τp  /  τd  ≈  (11 / 54)π2ν2. With approaching to an integer spin resonance a weak solenoid (φ <  < 1) brings a more stronger spin-orbit coupling than the Siberian Snake. In an accordance with (7) and (8), the ratio of the respective depolarization times is (ν = k)

[formula]

In our case, a comparison of the necessary field integral in the moderate approach and the Siberian snake variant looks like [formula] Tesla×  meter against 18.4 Tesla×  meter at E = 1763 MeV. The ratio of times is about 102, τd(φ  =  π) = 2.7 hours, τd(φ = 0.34  rad) = 97 seconds.

To date, an application of the Siberian Snakes is limited, mainly, to acceleration of the polarized proton and heavy ion beams in synchrotrons. In such machines the role of radiative processes in the spin kinetics is reduced to zero. At the electron-positron storage ring-collider VEPP-4M the radiative depolarization can limit the effectiveness of the developed method especially with growth of a target beam energy. Estimates show that using this method at full decompensation of the KEDR field integral one can cross the resonance E = 1322 MeV (ν = 3) practically without polarization loss during beam deacceleration with a rate of 2 MeV/s starting from 1550 MeV. But acceleration in the same manner from 1.85 GeV up to 2.4 GeV with crossing of the resonance E = 2203 MeV (ν = 5) leads to a three-fold decrease of the polarization degree.
