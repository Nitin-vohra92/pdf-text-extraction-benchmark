Introduction

Soon after the revolutionary discovery, through the careful observation of type Ia supernovae, that the expansion of our universe is accelerating [\citep=Perlmutter:1998np] [\citep=Riess:1998cb], several other probes were proposed to verify and quantify this important phenomenon. One of the most useful employs the so called Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). Acoustic waves propagated through the ionized plasm of the early universe, and then were quickly damped at a redshift zd  ~  1050. In linear theory, the baryon distribution retains some memory of this process [\citep=1970ApJ...162..815P]. This has motivated using the acoustic horizon scale rd as a cosmological standard ruler [\citep=Bassett:2009mm]. The length scale is imprinted, for example, in the Large Scale Structure (LSS) that we measure today [\citep=Eisenstein:2005su]; it produces a peak in the correlation function (CF) of a variety of tracers of the dark matter distribution at r  ~  100 Mpc/h [\citep=2014MNRAS.441...24A] [\citep=2015AA...574A..59D].

Like most standard rulers, the acoustic horizon is imperfect. Several effects slightly shift or distort the peak in the CF, including linear physics [\citep=2007ApJ...665...14S] [\citep=2008MNRAS.390.1470S], non-linear gravitational evolution [\citep=Crocce:2007dt], redshift space distortions and scale-dependent bias [\citep=2008PhRvD..77d3525S]. The resulting systematic effects are a serious challenge to using the BAO peak for sub-percent precision cosmology. Many approaches have been suggested to mitigate these effects. [\citep=Crocce:2007dt] [\citep=Taruya:2007xy] [\citep=Anselmi:2012cn] [\citep=2010PhRvD..82j3529D] [\citep=2015arXiv150404366B]

In this paper we propose a new way of looking at the BAO features in the correlation function. We identify a point in the correlation function that has three remarkable properties:

it is geometric, i.e. its position is independent of the power spectrum of the primordial density fluctuation parameters;

it is unaffected by nonlinearities and scale-dependent bias at percent-level precision, i.e. its position is redshift-independent;

the amplitude of the matter and halo correlation functions at this point are very weakly affected by nonlinearities or scale-dependent bias.

This point lies midway between the scales associated with the peak and the dip in the correlation function on BAO scales, a definition that holds true even as the dip and the peak shift due to nonlinear physics. Given (2) and (3) we denote this the "linear point" (LP). Properties (1) and (2) make the LP a standard ruler; property (3) makes the LP a useful window into growth of structure and bias. We discuss both below.

We devote most of this paper to an investigation of the nonlinear corrections to all the three relevant BAO scales, i.e. the dip, the peak and the linear point, taking into account the dominant effects of nonlinear gravity, redshift-space distortions and scale-dependent bias. The three scales show different sensitivities to these effects. We find the peak to be the most shifted, while the dip is shifted in the opposite direction. Due to the near-antisymmetry of the CF across the linear point, the position of the LP is much more stable. This makes the LP a potentially useful standard ruler. Furthermore, the matter and halo correlation functions evaluated at the LP agree with the linear theory values to a few percent. We exploit these features to propose new ways of measuring the linear growth and linear bias, and to provide consistency checks of our findings with present and future data.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section [\ref=sec:lin] we introduce the peak, the dip and the "linear point" in the linear theory correlation function of dark matter. We show that the linear point is almost a purely geometrical point, emphasizing how the correlation function is nearly antisymmetric about this linear point. In Section [\ref=sec:nl] we introduce the main sources of nonlinear distortions that affect the three BAO scales, namely nonlinear gravity, redshift distortions and scale dependent bias. We quantify systematics from nonlinear evolution in Section [\ref=sec:BAO] by showing how the near-antisymmetry of the CF across the linear point is the key feature that drives the linear behavior of the linear point. The correlation function amplitude is also linear to a few percent at the dip-peak middle point. Section [\ref=sec:use] discusses a number of possible estimators of the linear point. It also leverages the linear theory behaviour of the LP to furnish estimates of the linear theory growth factor. A final section summarizes our findings and discusses future directions.

The geometric "linear point" in the correlation function

There were two principal ideas behind Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements:

It is well known that both these assumptions break down at the linear [\citep=2007ApJ...665...14S] [\citep=2008MNRAS.390.1470S] and nonlinear levels [\citep=Crocce:2007dt] [\citep=2008PhRvD..77d3525S] when one probes the BAO at a precision of a few percent, which is relevant in this age of precision cosmology.

While it is well known that sp does not quite equal rd, in the following we will identify an actual linear geometric point in the correlation function whose position is not affected by nonlinear distortions at the percent level: it does not shift with time, i.e. redshift. We name this point the "linear point" (LP). The linear point is therefore an actual standard ruler, unlike the peak scale sp in the correlation function.

We start our analysis by introducing in Fig. [\ref=fig:BAOfeature] three scales in the BAO correlation function: a peak, a dip and the "linear point," defined (for reasons we explain below) as the peak-dip middle point: [formula]. The scale sLP corresponds to the inflection point in ξ to better than 0.5% precision.

In Fig. [\ref=fig:prim:fluct], by performing a linear analysis we show that the position of the linear point is indeed independent of ns, τ and As at the 0.02% level. (The As independence is true by definition in linear theory.) While this geometric property holds true in linear theory for the dip and the peak scales as well, it is well known that nonlinear evolution affects the positions of the peak and the dip, spoiling their geometric nature and their redshift independence [\citep=Crocce:2007dt] [\citep=2008PhRvD..77d3525S], and thus their status as standard rulers.

The linear correlation function is anti-symmetric in the peak-to-dip range (see Fig. [\ref=fig:BAOfeature]). One measure of this symmetry is to compare the scale sLP which was defined by the peak-dip positions (sd  +  dp) / 2, with the scale sA on which the amplitude of ξlin equals / 2. These two scales differ only slightly: sA  ≈  1.002sLP. In addition, the amplitude ξlin(sLP) corresponds to ξlin(sA) to ~  2 - 3% precision. (We show below that nonlinear effects improve this amplitude agreement to 1% level.) This anti-symmetry will be crucial for understanding why the linear point sLP is nearly unaffected by nonlinearities, and is the main reason why we prefer to work with ξ rather than r2ξ.

The linear-theory analysis presented in this section thus reveals that the matter correlation function gives us a new geometric point in the correlation function, the dip-peak midpoint, called the "linear point." In the next sections, we show that the linear point is unaffected by nonlinearities at percent level precision, making it an excellent cosmological "standard ruler."

Nonlinear distortions

Real space

Nonlinear gravitational clustering smooths the peak in the correlation function and shifts it slightly [\citep=1996ApJ...472....1B] [\citep=2007ApJ...665...14S] [\citep=Crocce:2007dt]. The smoothing is due to displacements from the initial positions, so the one-dimensional velocity dispersion in linear theory,

[formula]

where Plin is the matter power spectrum (PS) in linear theory, sets the scale of the smoothing.

In particular, in the Zel'dovich approximation [\citep=Zeldovich:1969sb], the smoothing due to the displacements is well-approximated by

[formula]

[\citep=Crocce:2005xy] [\citep=2015arXiv150507477P] [\citep=2015arXiv150605264V]. The resulting equation for the nonlinear ξ is

[formula]

Equation ([\ref=xiZel]) has been shown to accurately describe the correlation function in the BAO regime [\citep=Crocce:2007dt] [\citep=Angulo:2007fw] [\citep=2014MNRAS.440.1420R] [\citep=2015arXiv150605264V] [\citep=2015arXiv150507477P] [\citep=2015arXiv150404366B] and it has successfully been employed for BAO reconstruction [\citep=2007ApJ...664..660E] [\citep=2015MNRAS.450.3822W].

Redshift space

Galaxies are observed in redshift space, where the Hubble flow induced cosmological redshift has been distorted by peculiar velocities. The real-space-redshift-space map in the plane-parallel approximation is

[formula]

Here [formula] is the growth rate, [formula] is the line of sight direction, and [formula], where [formula] is the peculiar velocity and H is the conformal Hubble parameter.

The same bulk motions which generate nonlinear clustering also give rise to redshift space distortions [\citep=Kaiser:1987qv]. Moreover, the angular dependence of equation ([\ref=srmap]) means that the clustering signal can (and should!) be decomposed in spherical harmonics. For example, the redshift-space monopole associated with ξnl is

[formula]

where μ  =    ·   is the cosine between the line of sight and the wave vector. The integral over μ can be performed analytically, making numerical integration over k very fast [\citep=2010PhRvD..81b3526D] [\citep=2015arXiv150507477P]. The linear theory limit has no nonlinear smearing; so, setting σv  →  0 yields ξs0(s)  =  (1 + 2f / 3 + f2  /  5)  ξ(s) in linear theory [\citep=Kaiser:1987qv].

Halo bias: linear and scale dependent

In the real Universe (as opposed to simulations thereof), we cannot directly observe the matter field. Instead, we measure galaxies that inhabit halos which, in turn, are biased tracers of the matter field. In this section we focus on how halo bias (the halo-matter relation) affects the correlation function in the BAO regime. A detailed analysis of how bias affects the BAO features of the correlation function is beyond the scope of this paper. However, we present a preliminary investigation of this topic, and expect to carry on this study in future works.

We use the peaks theory approach to halo bias [\citep=1986ApJ...304...15B]. As before, we employ a simplified description that allows us to focus on the main effects (e.g., we ignore mode coupling terms). A good approximation to the correlation function of peaks is

[formula]

where bE10 is the usual Eulerian linear bias [\citep=2010PhRvD..82j3529D]. Similarly, the redshift-space monopole is simply

[formula]

where the integral over μ can again be done analytically [\citep=2010PhRvD..81b3526D].

Strictly speaking, we should replace σv in the expressions above with the velocity-biased value appropriate for peaks: σp  <  σv [\citep=2010PhRvD..81b3526D]. In addition, the expressions above should include the smoothing windows of radius Rp (one for each peak) associated with identifying the peaks. However, these are almost degenerate with σp in real space (and not quite as denegerate in redshift space). In effect, the expressions above have set R2p  +  σ2p  ≈  σ2v. In this respect, we compute σv from eq. ([\ref=sigma:v]) while we treat equations ([\ref=peak:nl]) and ([\ref=peak:nl:s]) as effective formulae, where bE10, bE01 could be evaluated by fitting to simulations [\citep=2015arXiv150507477P].

Why does the Linear Point remain linear?

Dark matter

Nonlinearities affect the locations of the BAO peak, dip and LP scales in two different ways:

smoothing the correlation function;

shifting the correlation function

[\citep=2008PhRvD..77d3525S]. To see this clearly, rewrite equation ([\ref=xiZel]) as

[formula]

where [formula] and

[formula]

The 3D convolution can be simplified to

[formula]

where the last equality is practically exact for r > 2R. This shows explicitly that the exponential term inside the integral smooths the correlation function, while the r' / r term shifts the peak of the Gaussian filter to higher r values. This, in turn, moves the peak of ξ to smaller r values.

Similarly, equation ([\ref=red:nl]) for the redshift-space monopole can be written as

[formula]

where [formula]. Since SG > RG the smoothing is larger in redshift space, but the overall effect is otherwise similar to that in real space.

To illustrate the effect of these nonlinearities, Fig. [\ref=fig:shift] shows the monopole of the redshift-space correlation function rescaled by the linear theory factor of D2  (1  +  2f / 3  +  f2 / 5) at z = 0 in a ΛCDM cosmology with Ωm = 0.265, Ωbh2 = 0.0226, h = 0.71, n = 0.963 and σ8 = 0.8. The vertical lines show the positions of the peak, dip and linear point for linear theory (σv  →  0) (dashed), the 1D Gaussian convolution (i.e. eq. ([\ref=conv1D]) with r' / r  →  1) (dotted), and the nonlinear model ξnl0(r) (continuous blue). Notice that the 1D Gaussian convolution moves the peak and the dip by the same amount, but in opposite directions, whereas the r' / r term shifts the whole correlation function to smaller values of r by 1%. Thus, the two effects add for the peak but they subtract for the dip. As a result, the dip shifts less than the peak.

More importantly, the scale of the linear point shifts even less than either the peak or the dip. The net result is that the peak moves by 3.5% to the left, the dip by 1.5% to the right and the linear point by just 1% to the left. (These shifts are smaller at higher redshifts, of course.) The peak is consequently the most sensitive point to nonlinear corrections and the linear point is the least. Moreover, because the dip and the peak share the same nonlinear smoothing, the amplitude of the linear point remains unchanged to within a few percent even though the dip and the peak (heights and scales) change significantly.

Biased tracers: Halos

To understand how halo bias affects the correlation function in the BAO regime we focus, for simplicity, on the real space results. The same arguments apply to the redshift space monopole.

To gain insight we write eq. ([\ref=peak:nl]) as a convolution of the linear correlation function, and simplify as before to obtain

[formula]

where we have dropped the "E" on the bias factors for convenience.

[\cite=2010PhRvD..82j3529D] have emphasized the fact that the terms proportional to b01 and b201 contribute significantly to the shape of ξhh on BAO scales. As their Figure 3 shows, these terms are approximately anti-symmetric in r, so they serve to enhance the BAO feature by increasing the height of the peak and depressing the dip. However, their figure also shows that these terms contribute little to the scale or the amplitude of the correlation function at the linear point. To see why, note that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Therefore, if ξlin(r) is approximately antisymmetric in r, then the integrals above will remain very small even if we insert a factor of ξlin(r') in the integrands. The terms proportional to b01 and b201 include an additional r' / r factor, but this factor will not change the value of the integral dramatically. We have checked numerically that including it indeed makes little difference. As a result, the terms proportional to b01 and b201 contribute little to the result [\cite=2010PhRvD..82j3529D]. This is why the correlation function amplitude at the LP is insensitive to scale-dependent bias, even when b01 is not negligible, despite the fact that the height and scale of the peak and dip can be strongly modified.

In other words, the antisymmetric structure of the correlation function is preserved even in the presence of scale-dependent bias. While this scale-dependence moves the peak and the dip in opposite directions, the linear point remains fixed. Furthermore the amplitude of the biased correlation function at the linear point is only sensitive to the scale-independent part of the linear bias factor, b10. Both these reasons increase the appeal of the LP as a standard ruler candidate.

Comparison with simulations

To check the accuracy of our analysis, we first compare equations ([\ref=xiZel]) and ([\ref=red:nl]) to measurements in the N-body simulations of a ΛCDM cosmology with Ωm = 0.265, Ωbh2 = 0.0226, h = 0.71, n = 0.963 and σ8 = 0.8 carried out by [\cite=2011PhRvD..84d3501S].

The top panel of Fig. [\ref=fig:rescaled] shows the real-space correlation function at four different redshifts, rescaled by the scale-independent linear growth factor. The bottom panel shows the same rescaled quantity for the redshift-space monopole. The symbols with error bars show the measurements while the continuous lines show the theoretical predictions presented in the previous section. (We compute these as integrals over P(k) rather than as real-space convolutions.)

The simulation measurements scatter much less than the 5 - 10% one would expect given the error bars, which were obtained from the scatter among 30 different realizations. Apparently, the points are strongly correlated, and a full error analysis must properly treat the covariance. If the smooth curve that the eye would fit through the points is a good approximation of the correlation function to be inferred from the simulations, and the very small point-to-point scatter around that by-eye fit is a fairer approximation of the true error bars, then it appears that, while the amplitude of the correlation function is at times discrepant between the simulations and the theory, the scales of the dip and the peak are correctly predicted to subpercent accuracy, and the LP to 0.5%. Fig. [\ref=sim:theory:m] shows this explicitly: the solid curves show the BAO peak, dip and LP scales, which we estimate by fitting a high-order polynomial to the measured ξ, and the corresponding dotted and dashed curves show the linear and nonlinear theory values of these scales.

Fig. [\ref=fig:rescaled:h] shows a similar analysis of the clustering of halos more massive than [formula] at all the redshifts. Symbols with error bars show the N-body results and smooth curves show eqns. ([\ref=peak:nl]) and ([\ref=peak:nl:s]). For these, the linear bias b210(z) is fit to the simulation, and we found b201(z) to be negligible given the large errorbars. The top panel shows the real-space correlation function at four different redshifts, rescaled by the scale-independent linear growth factor as well as the linear bias b210(z). The linear bias values at z = (0,0.5,1,2) are b10≃(1,1.29,1.72,2.95). The bottom panel, shows the rescaled redshift-space monopole, where β = f / b. The nonlinear theory predictions are in reasonable agreement with the measurements. Again, the error bars appear to be highly correlated, and, while the amplitude of ξ is often discrepant by up to 10%, the locations of the standard rulers are much more robust. Fig. [\ref=sim:theory:h], the analog of Fig. [\ref=sim:theory:m] shows a more quantitative comparison: Notice that, especially in redshift space, the peak and dip scales differ more significantly from the measurements. Nevertheless, the LP scale still agrees to better than 0.5%. We conclude that the LP is indeed a good ruler even for biased tracers at late times in redshift space.

Before we exploit this fact, it is worth making one final point. Recall that the amplitude of ξlin(sLP) is within about 3% of / 2. Figures [\ref=fig:rescaled] and [\ref=fig:rescaled:h] show that nonlinear evolution makes ξnl less steep than ξlin, both in real and redshift space. Hence, ξnl(sLP) corresponds to / 2 at percent level precision, a factor of two improvement with respect to linear theory.

Two consequences

Towards more accurate distance measurements

We have made the point that the LP is mainly sensitive to the shift arising from the r' / r factor (see Section [\ref=subsec:m]). We have found that a simple redshift independent 0.5% correction removes this effect:

[formula]

and restores agreement with the linear prediction to 0.5% at all redshifts both in real and redshift space.

This is not the only option. Since the peak and the dip scales are geometrical in linear theory, any linear combination of sd and sp which cancels the nonlinear shifts will return a geometric LP as well. We have found that the optimum weighted sum at z = 0 is

[formula]

this combination returns the same linear theory value at all higher redshifts to 0.7% (and can be corrected to 0.35% using the same approach as in equation ([\ref=linear:lp]).

One could even go further and employ a redshift weighted sum

[formula]

where c(z) and d(z) could be extracted from simulations so that slin(z) would correspond to the linear theory prediction, i.e. [formula] and [formula]. But we have not pursued this further as we feel we have made our main point: using information from both the peak and the dip is potentially very powerful. Indeed not only do eqns. ([\ref=linear:lp])-([\ref=linear:wz]) provide very stable scales for distance measurements, but comparing them at different redshifts provides useful cross checks.

Using the LP to measure growth

So far we have made the point that the LP is a good standard rod. However, its amplitude is also rather well-understood, so we now explore its use in measuring the linear theory growth factor.

Over the BAO range of scales, our model predicts that the peak and dip heights should differ more from their linear theory values than are the peak and dip scales (c.f. Figures [\ref=fig:rescaled] and [\ref=fig:rescaled:h]). However, at the LP, the amplitude of the correlation function is rather well described by linear theory. To make this point, Fig. [\ref=fig:relative] shows the ratio of the nonlinear to the linear CF in the simulations (symbols with error bars) and in our model (smooth curves). Although our model is able to describe the scale dependence of this ratio rather well (changes from unity can be as large as 40% at z = 0), it is remarkable how little the amplitude of the LP changes with redshift. Fig. [\ref=fig:relative:h] shows a similar analysis of biased tracers. Again, at the LP, this ratio is within a few percent of unity.

For unbiased tracers, our analysis of the LP scale motivates the following estimator for the ratio of the linear growth factor at redshifts z and z':

[formula]

Here [formula], where carated quantities are the estimates inferred from observations.

While this is conceptually straightforward, it assumes errors on the measured amplitude are negligible. Since this is rarely the case, one could reduce the effect of measurement errors by averaging the measured amplitude over more scales. E.g., one might set

[formula]

or even

[formula]

where N is the number of measurements done within the peak and the dip.

In view of our discussion of the similarity of nonlinearities in real and redshift space, one could build similar estimators of the ratio

[formula]

from measurements of the redshift-space monopole.

Extending this to biased tracers is similarly straightforward. We have already argued that the scale dependent bias terms matter little, so inserting the redshift space monopole of biased tracers for [formula] in equations ([\ref=growth:lp])-([\ref=growth:sum]) furnishes estimates of

[formula]

(The corresponding sums over the real space correlation function yield estimates of this quantity with β  →  0.)

In all three versions of our estimator, the shift of the whole correlation function due to the r' / r term in the convolution (see above) is irrelevant, provided that we consistently compare the peak-dip middle point . Therefore, these three estimators could also be used as a consistency check for the antisymmetry of the correlation function. In ΛCDM, we expect this antisymmetry to be slightly broken by the mode-coupling contribution to the correlation function, although exploring this is beyond the scope of this paper.

While implementing the three estimators with actual data is beyond the scope of this paper, we believe that the following example is encouraging. We focus on the halo redshift space monopole at z = 0 and z' = 0.5, since this biased tracers at low redshift are where the differences from linear theory are expected to be largest. We then simply compare the theoretical predictions of ξs,nl0,hh with measurements in simulations ξs,sim0,hh (obtained by fitting a polynomial to the measured [formula]) and with the linear theory value. For the halos in the simulation, the linear theory value of the ratio defined in ([\ref=bias:s]) is 0.9347. Our nonlinear model predicts 0.9359 for all three estimators of this ratio, whereas the measured values are (0.9303, 0.9338, 0.9321). The agreement between the estimators as well as the nonlinear model with the linear theory value is better than 1%. Clearly, an accurate analysis with actual BAO data is in order.

Discussion and conclusions

Since the first detection of the Baryon Acoustic peak in the galaxy correlation function [\citep=Eisenstein:2005su], tremendous effort, both theoretical and observational, has been devoted to reducing systematic uncertainties and improving the statistics.

With this in mind, we have searched for a special point in the correlation function whose scale and amplitude are least affected by nonlinear evolution. We have found that the point which lies midway between the peak and the dip of the correlation function on BAO scales, which we call the linear point sLP (see, e.g., Figure [\ref=fig:BAOfeature]), is shifted in scale from its linear theory value by less than 0.5%. Previous work has shown that nonlinear evolution smears out the height and shifts the scale of the peak. We showed that there are similar effects on the dip, but that these nonlinear corrections cancel out almost exactly at the linear point (Figure [\ref=fig:shift]). We provided analytic arguments for why this same LP is special for unbiased as well as biased tracers, in real and redshift space (Section [\ref=sec:BAO]), and showed that this was indeed the case in simulations (Figures [\ref=fig:rescaled] and [\ref=fig:rescaled:h]).

We believe that this motivates use of the LP for distance measurements, as it may remove the need to fit broadened correlation function templates to the measurement in order to infer the acoustic scale as is currently done [\citep=2009MNRAS.400.1643S] [\citep=Sanchez:2012sg]. For example, estimating sLP from the published BOSS DR11 galaxy correlation [\citep=2014MNRAS.441...24A], following the same simple procedures we used to estimate it in the simulations presented in the main text (fitting a high-order polynomial to the measured ξ) and applying eq. ([\ref=linear:lp]) yields 95.1h- 1 Mpc. For comparison, sLP in the fiducial model of [\cite=2014MNRAS.441...24A], divided by α = 1.03 as their Table 7 suggests, also yields 95.1h- 1 Mpc. We leave a more careful implementation of this procedure (e.g., accounting for covariances between bins, reconstruction, etc.) to future work.

A nontrivial consequence of the cancellation of nonlinear effects is that it is not just the scale of the LP which remains fixed: its height is also given by linear theory, to percent level precision, even at late times, for unbiased and biased tracers in real and redshift space (Figures [\ref=fig:relative] and [\ref=fig:relative:h]). We exploit this interesting property to motivate three estimators of the linear theory growth - eqns. ([\ref=growth:lp])-([\ref=growth:sum]) - and to compare our findings with data.

In practice, our simplest estimators of the growth constrain the combination b10D rather than b10 and D separately. We expect the width of the 'nonlinear' smoothing to be approximately independent of b10, so it may be that combining our LP-derived constraint on b10D with the more traditional estimators of the acoustic scale and its broadening will allow one to infer b10 and D separately. Breaking this degeneracy is the subject of work in progress.

Our detailed results for the CF structure in the BAO regime could be modified by non-standard physics. At the linear level we expect that the presence of massive neutrinos, some form of dark energy, or some modification of gravity will change the discussion of Section [\ref=sec:lin] [\citep=Thepsuriya:2014zda]. On the other hand, when we deal with nonlinearities we should be careful to make some distinctions. The BAO dip-peak region in the presence of massive neutrinos is well described by the same physics as ΛCDM [\citep=2015arXiv150507477P]. Quintessence and clustering quintessence also show the same nonlinear propagator as the standard case [\citep=Anselmi:2014nya], the transition from large to small scales being smooth. On the other hand, a preferred scale often appears in modified gravity models, so eq.  ([\ref=xiZel]) can no longer be applied naively [\citep=Scoccimarro:2009eu]. It is not obvious that the antisymmetric features of the correlation function will be preserved in general. In this regard, precise measurements by future surveys of departures from the antisymmetry in the BAO range of scales would be a clear signature of non-standard gravity.
