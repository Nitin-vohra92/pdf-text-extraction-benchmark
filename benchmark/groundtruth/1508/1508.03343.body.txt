Introduction

Three-dimensional spacetime is an important playground for various aspects of gravitational physics. An example of well-studied gravitational theory in 3d is topologically massive gravity, introduced by Deser, Jackiw and Templeton [\cite=DJT82a] [\cite=DJT82b] which contains higher derivative gravitational Chern-Simons, as well as the gauge Chern-Simons corrections to the Einstein-Maxwell gravity.

Here we study a broader class of theories described by the action,

[formula]

with the gravitational Lagrangian [formula] and the (minimally coupled) electromagnetic Lagrangian [formula]. The corresponding gravitational field equations have the form

[formula]

where the Lagrangian [formula] is such that the tensor Eab is allowed to be diff-covariant and differentiable but otherwise completely general function of the spacetime metric, the Ricci tensor, the Levi-Civita tensor and covariant derivatives. The electromagnetic Lagrangian [formula] consists of the conventional Maxwell term and the gauge Chern-Simons term (with the coupling constant μ),

[formula]

It is important to emphasize that the Maxwell Chern-Simons term doesn't depend on the spacetime metric, hence it doesn't change the form of the electromagnetic energy-momentum tensor,

[formula]

The Maxwell-Chern-Simons field equations are given by

[formula]

For example, in the topologically massive gravity the tensor Eab is the sum of the Einstein tensor Gab, the cosmological constant term and the Cotton tensor,

[formula]

where λ is the gravitational Chern-Simons coupling constant and

[formula]

Other additional terms have been introduced and analysed within the "new massive gravity" model [\cite=BHT09] and its extensions [\cite=Sinha10]. Some exact solutions of the field equations ([\ref=eq:ET]) and ([\ref=eq:MaxwCS]) with Eab and Tab given by ([\ref=TMG]) and ([\ref=Tem]) were found and analysed in [\cite=DS00] [\cite=MCGL08]. An example of non-polynomial tensor Eab appears in the Born-Infeld gravity model [\cite=DG98] [\cite=BF10] [\cite=GST10].

Our focus is on spacetimes (M,gab,Fab) which admit at least one (sufficiently smooth) Killing vector field ξa, such that £ξgab  =  0. A typical (and often implicit) assumption in the literature is that the gauge fields inherit the symmetries, £ξFab  =  0. For example in [\cite=BCPDPS11b], using this as an assumption it was shown that in spherically symmetric spacetimes general, D  ≥  3, Chern-Simons terms [\cite=BCPDPS11a] [\cite=BCPDPS13] do not influence equations of motion. However, there are known examples of 4-dimensional spacetimes, solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell equations, where such assumptions do not hold [\cite=MW75] [\cite=SKMHH]. Several analyses [\cite=Woo73a] [\cite=Woo73b] [\cite=MzHRS74] [\cite=MW75] [\cite=WY76b] [\cite=Tod06], focused on four dimensional electromagnetic fields, have shown that in general the symmetry inheritance is broken in the following way

[formula]

with some function β, which is a constant if Fab is non-null (we say that Fab is a null electromagnetic field if FabFab  =  Fab *  Fab  =  0). As Fab and its Hodge dual *  Fab are both 2-forms only in 4-dimensional spacetimes, it is not straightforward to extrapolate this conclusion to higher or lower dimensional cases. Our aim is to fill this gap in the literature, at least for the three-dimensional case.

Symmetry inheritance

Clearly, for any Killing vector field ξa we immediately have £ξEab  =  0. By using the field equation ([\ref=eq:ET]) it follows that

[formula]

The main idea is to use the above equation to conclude as much as possible about the symmetries of the electromagnetic field, described by the tensor field £ξFab.

To begin with, it is convenient to split Fab into electric and magnetic parts. Given a non-null vector field Xa we introduce formal electric 1-form Ea and magnetic scalar B [\cite=Heusler] [\cite=ISm12] [\cite=ISm14],

[formula]

which allow us to make decomposition of the electromagnetic 2-form,

[formula]

where [formula] is the norm of the vector field Xa. In some cases these fields can be directly related to physical observables: An observer with 3-velocity ua will measure the electric and magnetic field given by the choice Xa  =  ua. On the other hand, in the context of symmetry analysis, a natural and practical choice is a decomposition ([\ref=eq:FEB]) with respect to the Killing vector field, Xa  =  ξa.

We now use this symmetry motivated decomposition on the right hand side of the expression for the energy momentum tensor ([\ref=Tem]). We have

[formula]

[formula]

where [formula]. The Lie derivatives £ξ of the left hand sides of both of these equations vanish due to ([\ref=eq:LieT]), implying in turn that

[formula]

and

[formula]

There is, however, a potential technical issue if the Killing vector field ξa becomes null on some subset of the spacetime: as it is no longer to possible to "reconstruct" Fab from Ea and B at such points, one has to find another appropriate vector field. Let us denote by Z  ⊆  M the (closed) set where ξaξa  =  0. We always assume that all points where the Killing vector field vanishes, ξa  =  0 (e.g. the axis of symmetry or the bifurcation surface of the Killing horizon) belong to the boundary ∂Z. Since the norm of the Killing vector is constant along its orbits (integral curves), it follows that each orbit of ξa is either contained in Z or disjoint from it. On each orbit γ of ξa contained in the interior [formula], at a point [formula] one can choose an auxiliary timelike vector va and then Lie drag it with respect to ξa along the γ. Furthermore, let Σp be a (locally defined) smooth spacelike hypersurface passing through the point p and [formula] a neighbourhood of the point p. Then, starting with a choice of (sufficiently smooth) timelike vector field va on the intersection [formula], one can repeat the procedure of Lie dragging along each orbit of ξa which intersects the set [formula]. This allows us to construct a timelike vector field va which immediately satisfies £ξva  =  0 on a tubular neighbourood of the orbit γ and can be used there for the decomposition ([\ref=eq:FEB]). In order to avoid confusion, let us introduce the notation

[formula]

for the electric and the magnetic fields defined with respect to the vector field va. By construction we have that £ξ(Tabvavb)  =  0 and [formula], so that equations analogous to ([\ref=eq:LieTxixi]) and ([\ref=eq:LiexiTxi]) follow from here,

[formula]

[formula]

We can now state and prove the main result of this paper.

The gist of the proof is to split the spacetime into four regions corresponding to points where B and ξaξa are zero/non-zero, then to do an analysis on interiors of these regions, and finally to extend the conclusions to the boundary points of each region. In order to extend to the boundary we need to assume the continuity of the fields and use the following two elementary results from the point-set topology.

The second lemma ascertains that all the points of the manifold are covered by the end of the process.

The set X can represent the whole spacetime manifold M or just some open subset of M with the induced subspace topology.

The introduction of the four regions is necessary in order to cover the cases in which, say, region ξaξa  =  0 has a nonempty interior and is not just a lower dimensional subset of M. In case the whole region ξaξa  =  0 is just a boundary of an open region ξaξa  ≠  0, the conclusion would follow simply from continuity by extending the results from the open region ξaξa  ≠  0 to the boundary.

Proof of the Theorem 1. If we denote the (possibly empty) closed set of points where Fab  =  0 by W  ⊆  M, then the claim is trivial on its interior [formula]. Therefore, we focus our discussion on the open set M  -  W where the electromagnetic field is nonvanishing and extend the conclusions to the boundary ∂W using lemma 2 and the continuity of the tensor field £ξFab.

The proof rests upon the decomposition ([\ref=eq:FEB]) of the electromagnetic tensor Fab with respect to the Killing vector field ξa. Accordingly, we treat two separate cases:

The points where Fab  ≠  0 and ξaξa  ≠  0, i.e. the points from the open set

[formula]

We consider two separate subcases:

On the open subset of points where B  ≠  0 holds, the equation ([\ref=eq:LiexiTxi]) implies

[formula]

which together with ([\ref=eq:LieTxixi]) gives

[formula]

Thus, on the open subset where B2  ≠  EaEa we immediately have £ξB  =  0. On the other hand, within the interior of the closed set where the equality B2  =  EaEa holds, the Lie derivative £ξ of this equality together with ([\ref=eq:LieTxixi]) implies again that £ξB  =  0. Furthermore, £ξB  =  0 implies via ([\ref=eq:LiexiTxi]) that £ξEa  =  0. Hence, using the continuity of the field £ξFab we can conclude that the symmetry is inherited, £ξFab  =  0, on all points of the set O where B  ≠  0.

On the interior of the closed set of points where B  =  0 holds we have

[formula]

By taking the Hodge dual (which commutes with £ξ since ξa is a Killing vector field) we get

[formula]

Here it might seem that the presence of the gauge CS term might allow the breaking of the symmetry inheritance, however, we shall show that this cannot happen. Using Maxwell-Chern-Simons equations ([\ref=eq:MaxwCS]) and ([\ref=eq:LieFmuF]) we have

[formula]

and then

[formula]

Let us now look back at the complete electromagnetic energy-momentum tensor ([\ref=Tem]), expressed with electric field 1-form (note that by assumption B  =  0),

[formula]

where N  =  ξaξa. Using the fact that £ξξa  =  0, £ξN  =  0 and £ξ(EcEc)  =  0 (which follows from ([\ref=eq:LieTxixi])), we have

[formula]

Contracting with Eb we get

[formula]

So, at each such point either £ξEa  =  0, therefore £ξFab  =  0 and the symmetry is inherited, or Ea is a null vector. Let us look more closely at a point p∈O where the latter case occurs. Here it is easy to see that

[formula]

whence [formula] is also null and, furthermore, by ([\ref=eq:LieTxixi]), orthogonal to Ea. This implies that these two are proportional at the point p,

[formula]

which together with ([\ref=eq:LieEE]) gives

[formula]

Since by assumption p∉W it follows from here that α  =  0 and thus £ξEa  =  0. Note, however, that symmetry inheritance £ξFab  =  0 contradicts the equation ([\ref=eq:LieFmuF]) under the assumption Fab  ≠  0, unless μ  =  0. Again, boundary points of the set where B  =  0 are covered by the argument of continuity.

The points where Fab  ≠  0 and ξaξa  =  0, i.e. the points from the open set [formula]. Here, on a tubular neighbourhood of each orbit of ξa, one can construct an auxiliary timelike vector field va such that £ξva  =  0, as described above the theorem 1, and use it for the decomposition ([\ref=eq:FEB]). As the equations ([\ref=eq:LieTvv]) and ([\ref=eq:LievTv]) are completely analogous to the equations ([\ref=eq:LieTxixi]) and ([\ref=eq:LiexiTxi]), the proof in the (a) case from above (that is, when [formula]) can be repeated essentially unaltered. In the (b) case (that is, when [formula]) we turn to the complete energy-momentum tensor

[formula]

where V  =  vava. Using the fact that, by construction, £ξV  =  0 and that ([\ref=eq:LieTvv]) implies [formula], we have

[formula]

Additional contraction with [formula] gives us

[formula]

So, either [formula] and we are finished with the proof, or [formula]. The latter case, however, is impossible since [formula] and va is by construction timelike!

Finally, the conclusions about the symmetry inheritance can be extended to the set [formula] using continuity of the tensor field £ξFab.

Now, as a consequence of the symmetry inheritance we know that [formula] (the electric field 1-form is a closed form) and [formula]. Note that in the absence of the gauge CS term, μ  =  0, the magnetic field B is necessarily constant! This, however doesn't imply that the general observer with the 3-velocity ua will measure a constant magnetic field B̂. We have (see [\cite=KS13])

[formula]

For example, for a stationary observer in a stationary spacetime with the corresponding Killing vector ka, its 3-velocity is given by

[formula]

at all points where ka is timelike, and the value of the magnetic scalar measured by this observer is

[formula]

which is reminiscent of the gravitational redshift and Tolman's law. In this example, the magnetic field B̂ is time independent, but can have different values at different points of the spacelike hypersurfaces.

It is often very practical to introduce the gauge 1-form Aa via [formula], unique up to a gauge transformation [formula]. What does the Theorem 1 tell us about the symmetry inheritance of Aa? As the Lie and the exterior derivative commute, we know that £ξA must be a closed form. Thus, the Poincaré lemma implies that at least locally there exist a function α, such that [formula]. But then, using appropriate local choice of the gauge defined by £ξλ  =    -  α, we have [formula].

A word has to be said on the scope of our theorem. It applies to all theories in three dimensions which satisfy the following conditions: (i) the equation for gravity can be put in the form ([\ref=eq:ET]), where the energy-momentum tensor Tab is as in the standard Maxwell theory and £ξEab  =  0 holds; (ii) equations of motion for the electromagnetic field are as in ([\ref=eq:MaxwCS]). We have mentioned that this includes all diff-covariant metric theories of gravity minimally coupled to the electromagnetic field with the Maxwell plus gauge Chern-Simons Lagrangian. Naturally, one may contemplate extending the theorem to other classes of theories. However, under the current proof, this is possible only if the above mentioned requirements are satisfied. For example, if one considers theories which contain additional matter or torsion, one has to assume that additional degrees of freedom do not couple to the electromagnetic field and do not violate symmetry of the tensor Eab, which obviously puts some symmetry requirements on these fields. An interesting problem would be to consider the massive Proca theory instead of the massless spin-1 U(1) gauge field. However, addition of mass affects both the equations of motion and the energy-momentum tensor in a way which makes it unclear how to extend the analysis and conclusions presented in this paper.

Final remarks

We have presented a proof that the question from the title of the paper has an affirmative answer for a broad range of three-dimensional theories. For example, the argument works in the case of a "typical" spacetime with symmetries, consisting of several regions with non-null Killing vector, parcelled with Killing horizons and pierced with axis of symmetry. The proof may possibly break at points where the Killing vector field ξa or the electromagnetic field Fab have discontinuities.

The result presented in this paper can be seen as a part of a wider survey of symmetry inheritance for various physical fields. A series of papers [\cite=Hoen78] [\cite=BST10a] [\cite=BST10b] [\cite=GJ14b] [\cite=ISm15] has shown that possible symmetry inheritance breaking is highly restricted for the real and complex scalar fields. For example, in addition to well-known solution by Wyman [\cite=Wyman81], an important example of a rotating black hole with complex scalar field, which evades the Bekenstein's no-hair theorem due to symmetry noninheritance, has been recently found by Herdeiro and Radu [\cite=HR14].

Now that we know symmetry inheritance properties of the electromagnetic field in three and four dimensional spacetimes, it remains to be seen what the general conclusions in higher dimensional spacetimes are. Also, apart from one analysis of the electromagnetic field with perfect fluid [\cite=WY76a], there are no other results about the symmetry inheritance when multiple fields are present or when the gauge field is nonminimally coupled to gravity. Another line of pursuit both in three and higher number of dimensions would be to extend the result to gravity theories written in the vielbein formalism.
