Tensor Powers of the Defining Representation of Sn

Introduction

The defining, or permutation, representation of Sn is the n-dimensional representation ϱ where

[formula]

Since the fixed points of σ can be read off of the matrix diagonal, the character of ϱ at σ, χϱ(σ), is precisely the number of fixed points of σ. The irreducible representations, or irreps for short, of Sn are parametrized by the partitions of n, and ϱ decomposes as [formula]. Note that χS(n - 1,1)(σ) is one less than the number of fixed points of σ. In the terminology of [\cite=FH91], we call the (n - 1)-dimensional irrep S(n - 1,1) the standard representation of Sn.

A classic question in the representation theory of symmetric groups is how tensor products of representations decompose as direct sums of irreps. In Section 2 we will present a neat formula for the decomposition of tensor powers of ϱ and, as corollary, that of tensor powers of S(n - 1,1).

Our study of tensor powers of ϱ arose from an investigation in the mixing time of the Markov chain on Sn formed by applying a single uniformly chosen n-cycle to a deck of n cards and following up with repeated random transpositions. This chain is a natural counterpart to the random transposition walk on Sn, famously shown by Diaconis and Shahshahani in [\cite=DS81] to mix in O(n ln n) steps, in the sense that random transpositions induce Markov chains on not just Sn, but the set of partitions of n: the time-homogeneous random transposition walk is one such chain that starts at the partition (1n), whereas the process we proposed is one that starts at the other extreme, (n). Along with following the classic approach of [\cite=DS81], we will use the tensor decomposition formula to show in Section 3 that the mixing time for the n-cycle-to-transpositions chain is O(n).

Decomposition Formula for Tensor Powers of ϱ

Let λ be a partition of n, and recall that the irreps of Sn, the Sλ's, are indexed by the partitions of n. As promised, we give a compact formula for the decomposition of tensor powers of ϱ into irreps, i.e. the coefficients aλ,r in the expression

[formula]

Let [formula] and 1  ≤  r  ≤  n - λ2. The multiplicity of Sλ in the irreducible representation decomposition of [formula] is given by

[formula]

where [formula] with weight [formula], fλ̄ is the number of standard Young tableaux of shape λ̄, and [formula] is a Stirling number of the second kind.

Goupil and Chauve derived in [\cite=GC06] the generating function

[formula]

By (24b) and (24f) in Chapter 1 of [\cite=Sta97],

[formula]

and

[formula]

where B0: = 1 and [formula] is the t-th Bell number, so we obtain from ([\ref=EqTensorGF]) that

[formula]

and thus

[formula]

By (24.1.3, II.A) of [\cite=AS65],

[formula]

so that

[formula]

as was to be shown.

Now, let bλ,r be the multiplicities such that

[formula]

Goupil and Chauve also derived the generating function

[formula]

so from Proposition [\ref=PrIrreps] we can obtain a formula for the decomposition of [formula] as well.

Let [formula] and 1  ≤  r  ≤  n - λ2. The multiplicity of Sλ in the irreducible representation decomposition of [formula] is given by

[formula]

Comparing ([\ref=EqTensorGF2]) with ([\ref=EqTensorGF]) gives

[formula]

so that

[formula]

and the result follows.

Corollary [\ref=CoIrreps] is very similar to Proposition 2 of [\cite=GC06], but our result is cleaner, as it does not involve associated Stirling numbers of the second kind. For another approach to the decomposition of tensor powers of ϱ, see [\cite=Ful10].

Connection to Markov Chain Mixing Time

Consider the Markov chain on Sn formed by first applying a random n-cycle to a deck of n cards and then following with repeated random transpositions. Formally, form a Markov chain {Xk} on the symmetric group Sn as follows: let X0 be the identity, set X1  =  πX0, where π is a uniformly selected n-cycle, and for k  ≥  2 set Xk  =  τkXk - 1, where τk is a uniformly selected transposition. Observe that Xk∈An when n and k are of the same parity. Otherwise, [formula]. Let μk be the law of Xk, and let Uk be the uniform measure on An if Xk∈An and the uniform measure on [formula] if [formula]. What is the total variation distance between μk and Uk?

The goal of this section is to prove the following:

For any c > 0, after one n-cycle and cn transpositions,

[formula]

as n goes to infinity.

The upper bound follows from the approach of [\cite=DS81]. For the (lazy) random transposition shuffle on n cards, the time-homogeneous chain on Sn with increment measure υ that assigns mass [formula] to the identity and [formula] to each of the [formula] transpositions τ, Diaconis and Shahshahani derived the bound

[formula]

where U is the uniform measure on Sn, [formula] is the set of irreps of Sn, and dρ and χρ(τ) denote the dimension and the character at τ of the representation ρ, respectively. Careful computations of the terms on the RHS of ([\ref=EqSpectral]) gave a mixing time of O(n ln n), and explicit constants were later calculated by Saloff-Coste and Zúñiga in [\cite=S-CZ08].

Inequality ([\ref=EqSpectral]) comes from the theory of non-commutative Fourier analysis on Sn. It carries the following routine extension (carefully spelled out in Chapter 2 of [\cite=Din14]) to the n-cycle-to-transpositions chain:

[formula]

For any c > 0, after one n-cycle and cn transpositions,

[formula]

as n goes to infinity.

Let χλγ denote the character of Sλ on the cycle type γ. The first and most critical step of the proof is the observation that, discounting (n) and (1n), χλ(n)  =  0 for all λ except the hook-shaped ones, for which λ2 = 1. This is an almost trivial consequence of the Murnaghan-Nakayama rule, as it is impossible to remove a rim hook of size n from a Young diagram of size n unless the Young diagram itself is the rim hook. Moreover, for a hook-shaped λ, it is clear that χλ(n) is equal to 1 if λ has an odd number of rows and - 1 if λ has an even number of rows. Thus we arrive at a significant simplication of ([\ref=EqFinalUB]), namely that

[formula]

where

[formula]

The normalized characters [formula] have a simple description when λ∈Λn: let j be one less than the number of rows of λ, then for [formula],

[formula]

This is a special case of the identity

[formula]

known as early as to Frobenius in [\cite=Fro00].

Fix any c > 0. By calculus, for n - 1 - 2j  >  0,

[formula]

Thus ([\ref=PrUBnNC]) and the fact that χλγ  =    ±  χλ'γ, where λ' is the conjugate partition of λ (see p. 25 of [\cite=Jam78]), imply that

[formula]

Summing the geometric series gives

[formula]

as was to be shown.

For measures μ and ν on a set G, a classic approach to finding a lower bound for [formula] is to identify a subset A of G where [formula] is close to maximal. In many mixing problems involving the symmetric group, it is convenient to make A either the set of fixed-point-free permutations or its complement, since it is well-known that the distribution of the number of fixed points with respect to the uniform measure on Sn is asymptotically P(1), the Poisson distribution of mean one. The same is true for the distribution of fixed points with respect to the uniform measure on either An or [formula]. See Theorem 4.3.3 of [\cite=Din14] for a proof.

For Diaconis and Shahshahani's random transposition shuffle, A is the set of permutations with one or more fixed points, and finding μk(A) boils down to a coupon collector's problem. Let B be the event that, after k transpositions, at least one card is untouched. It is not difficult to see that [formula], where [formula] is equal to the probability that at least one of n coupons is still missing after 2k trials. The coupon collector's problem is well-studied, so this immediately gives a lower bound for μk(A), which in turn produces a lower bound for [formula].

The above argument is so short and simple that it was tagged onto the end of the introduction of [\cite=DS81], as if an afterthought. Unfortunately, it is inapplicable to our problem, since the initial n-cycle obliterates the core of the argument. Instead, we will fully characterize the distribution of χϱ with respect to μk + 1 by deriving all moments of χϱ with respect to μk + 1. Let Eμ denote expectation with respect to μ, then as observed in Chapter 3D of [\cite=Dia88],

[formula]

so that

[formula]

where [formula] is the Fourier transform of μ and

[formula]

Fix any c > 0. As n approaches infinity, the distribution of the number of fixed points after one n-cycle and cn transpositions converges to P(1 - e- 2c).

One can deduce from the moment-generating function that the r-th moment of P(ν) is [formula]. It is a standard result that (S(n)) = 1, and we will ignore the alternating representation because it suffices to consider the first n - 2 moments, in which the alternating representation does not appear. For the non-trivial and non-alternating representations, we take advantage of previous computations and synthesize ([\ref=PrUBnNC]), ([\ref=EqUBnLh]) with n instead of 2n, and ([\ref=EqAlready]) to obtain

[formula]

By Proposition [\ref=PrIrreps] (second line below) and ([\ref=EqSim]) (fourth line), for 1  ≤  r  ≤  n - 2,

[formula]

This shows that the first n - 2 moments of χϱ with respect to μcn + 1 approach those of P(1 - e- 2c), and convergence follows from the method of moments.

For any c > 0, after one n-cycle and cn transpositions,

[formula]

as n goes to infinity.

Let A be the set of fixed-point-free permutations. Then

[formula]

as was to be shown.

Together with Proposition [\ref=ThLimitn], Corollary [\ref=CoLBn] completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=ThMain].
