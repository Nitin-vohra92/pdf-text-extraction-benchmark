Abstract

The spectrum of observables in the induced lattice gauge model proposed recently by V.A.Kazakov and A.A.Migdal obeys the local-confinement selection rule. The underlying local continuous symmetry cannot be spontaneously broken within the model.

V.Kazakov and A.Migdal have recently proposed an induced lattice gauge model which could (in a continuum limit) be equivalent to QCD [\cite=KM]. The gauge self-interaction is induced by the hermitean-matrix-valued scalar field, [formula], coupled to link gauge variables, Uμ(x)∈SU(N). x is an index numbering sites of a regular D-dimensional lattice; [formula] are D directions and U-  μ(x) = U+μ(x - μ). The lattice action can be written in the form

[formula]

where V(z) is a general potential (one could add a kinetic term for Φ(x) as well). This interesting model is soluble at large N by the mean field technique [\cite=Mig] [\cite=Gross] [\cite=KhMak] [\cite=Mak]. Gauge variables are independent and can be integrated out at each link by the Itzykson-Zuber formula [\cite=ItZub]

[formula]

where φ and ψ can be regarded without loss of generality as real diagonal matrices; Δ(φ) is the Van-der-Monde determinant. As a result, one gets theory where the role of dynamical variables is played by N eigenvalues of a matrix Φ(x). In the N  →    ∞   limit the mean field approximation gives an exact answer.

As the scalar fields are auxiliary, the complete set of observables in the model is given by the correlators of Wilson loops

[formula]

where [formula] is the character of an Ri'th irrep of SU(N) as the function of the product of gauge variables along an i'th loop, Li. In general, loops can be (self)intersecting. As characters are traces of matrix elements, we can, using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, re-expand eq. ([\ref=corr]) at links of intersections getting the following basic integral to calculate

[formula]

where DRab(U) is a matrix element of an irrep R; [formula] are indices in a space, VR, of R (dR is the dimension of VR). φ and ψ are real and diagonal without loss of generality, since the field Φ(x) can be diagonalized independently at each link by a pure gauge transformation.

The one-link action, trφUψU+, in eq. ([\ref=int]) is symmetric with respect to the multiplication by [formula] matrices on the left and on the right:

[formula]

Consequenses of this symmetry were thoroughly investigated in the contex of D = 1 compactified string theory in ref. [\cite=BK]. It gives rise to the following selection rule for representations

[formula]

where [formula], are highest weight components of an irrep R (for SU(N), they are defined upto a common shift by an integer). Formally, it is the confinement selection rule in low energy QCD. For example, the fundamental representation does not obey eq. ([\ref=selrule]). The first non-trivial irrep giving non-zero answer is the adjoint. This selection rule is called the local confinement, since two quarks cannot be separated even by one lattice space. It is quite analogous to the one following from the local ZN symmetry of the model [\cite=Kogan&Co]. However, the symmetry under continuous transformations ([\ref=trans]) leads to further consequences. Following to ref. [\cite=BK], let us substitute eq. ([\ref=trans]) in eq. ([\ref=int]) and, as the answer cannot depend on α's and β's, we can integrate over them

[formula]

[formula]

where

[formula]

is a projector, since

[formula]

As was proven in the appendix A of ref. [\cite=BK], PR projects onto the subspace of VR spanned by all zero-weight vectors. This subspace, V(0)R, is not empty only for irreps satisfying eq. ([\ref=selrule]) and only particles corresponding to vectors from V(0)R can appear even in intermediate states. From the QCD point of view, such particles are colorless ( i.e. they coincide with their anti-particles).

As the symmetry ([\ref=trans]) is local, it cannot be spontaneously broken within the model ([\ref=action]). Details of the potential V(Φ) were not important for our consideration.

The dimension of V(0)R,

[formula]

increases with N slower than the dimension of the whole space VR,

[formula]

When N  →    ∞  , we have

[formula]

For example, for the adjoint

[formula]

and, hence,

[formula]

for an arbitrary loop L encircling a non-zero area. Such behavior is incompatible with the usual area law.

It is clear that the symmetry under consideration means a reduction of degrees of freedom comparing to standard lattice QCD. On the other hand, it is this symmetry that makes the model soluble via the Itzykson-Zuber formula ([\ref=ItZub]). Any attempt to broke the former brokes the latter. Therefore, at any N, the model is always in the local-confinement phase, all virtual particles being completely colorless. This picture is in agreement with direct calculations carried out for the quadratic potential in refs. [\cite=Gross] [\cite=KhMak].
