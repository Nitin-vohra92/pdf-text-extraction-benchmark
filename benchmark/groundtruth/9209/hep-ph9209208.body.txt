In the conventional standard model baryon (B) and lepton number (L) invariance are automatic consequences of the gauge symmetry and the particle contents. Contrary to this the supersymmetric standard model (SSM) has to be endowed with certain discrete symmetries (typically R parity) to enforce the B- and/or L-invariance. An interesting possibility is to interpret these discrete symmetries as gauge symmetries [\cite=kw] which can be remnants of a broken unifying gauge group. Moreover, discrete gauge symmetries can stabilize B- and L-invariance even if quantum gravity effects violate global symmetries. The discrete symmetries should then fulfill certain anomaly-free conditions [\cite=bd] [\cite=ibanez_ross]. Recently, it has been found that proton stability or solar neutrino mixing can be consistent with certain classes of anomaly-free discrete symmetries [\cite=ibanez_ross] [\cite=kap_mayr_nilles].

In this paper, we address the question of an "automatic" PQ-symmetry [\cite=kim_physrep] in the SSM guaranteed by a certain discrete gauge symmetry which is assigned to prevent serious B- or L-violation. As a consequence all desirable global symmetries of the model can be made stable against possible quantum gravity effects.

As we will see it appears to be very difficult to implement an automatic PQ-symmetry of the Kim-type [\cite=kim_axion]. Therefore we concentrate on the Dine-Fishler-Srednicki-axion [\cite=dfs] and we extend the Higgs sector of the SSM by adding some standard model singlets Ai (PQ-fields). The requirements of automatic PQ lead to a solution of the μ-problem [\cite=kim_nilles] [\cite=kim] by introducing the d = 5 operator HA2. When the field A gets a vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the order of fa (fa is the PQ-symmetry breaking scale with 1010 GeV < fa < 1012 GeV) the generated μ-term receives the correct order of magnitude.

Depending on the PQ-field contents and discrete symmetries, various kinds of B-, L- or PQ-violating operators appear. One should check whether some combinations of these operators can be eliminated to ensure proton stability and the axion solution of the strong CP problem. In particular, the axion solution is very sensitive to the presence of higher dimensional PQ-nonsinglets because of the small axion mass [\cite=automatic_PQ].

The fermionic part of the chiral superfields Ai can serve as a right handed neutrino (RHN) due to the possible couplings LA and LA2. Clearly neutrino masses can be generated by nontrivial VEV's < A > . In addition, the see-saw mechanism [\cite=see_saw] can be operative depending on the masses of the fields A. Indeed this amounts to the supersymmetric version of the neutrino-axion connection investigated in [\cite=n_a_conn]. Another purpose of this paper is to discuss the phenomenological implications for neutrino physics in this context. Especially we address to possible solutions of the solar-neutrino-problem recently confirmed as a problem of elementary particle physics by the measurement of the GALLEX-Collaboration [\cite=GALLEX] [\cite=bludman].

We begin our discussion with the DFS-type axionic extensions [\cite=dfs] of the SSM. The classification of discrete gauge symmetries for the SSM was given by Ibáñez and Ross [\cite=ibanez_ross]. They wrote all discrete symmetries gN compatible with "standard" operators in terms of three generators :

[formula]

which leads to charges of the standard particles as given in table [\ref=tab_:_disc_charges]. Additionally this symmetries have to fulfill anomaly cancelation conditions due to the gravity-, SU(3)- and SU(2)-interaction. In our extension the generators of eq. ([\ref=standard_symm]) have to be continued to the new fields Ai. Moreover new generators can appear which only act non trivially on the Ai. What happens in detail of course depends on the explicit form of the superpotential. Some examples will be given later. The modified form of the anomaly cancelation conditions reads

[formula]

where η = 1 for N even and η = 0 for N odd. Since we added SM-singlets only the gravity anomaly is modified by [formula]. Parts of our discussion can be done referring to the value of k instead of using the explicit form of W(Ai).

We start with the implications of the automatic-PQ idea. An explicit H-term violates the PQ-symmetry and so we should demand n  ≠  0. The last two anomaly free conditions show that only a restricted class of discrete symmetries is compatible with this requirement :

[formula]

Having forbidden H we are forced to generate this term dynamically. This amounts to solving the μ-problem. Introducing the conventional DFS-coupling HA1,however, needs a very small coupling constant. Therefore we use one of the terms HA1A2 or HA21 which naturally lead to the desired order of magnitude. For discrete symmetries with N = 3i the second term cannot be used because the coupling A31 then violates PQ-symmetry. Moreover PQ-symmetry has to be respected by higher dimensional operators. As shown recently [\cite=automatic_PQ], the lowest PQ-nonsinglet operators constructed out of only PQ-fields should be of (component field) dimension d = 10. But the restriction is less stringent for the standard fields since they have much smaller VEV's than PQ-fields. For standard operators, it is enough to forbid L , i. e. m  ≠  r, to protect the axion solution. For mixed operators (operators containing standard fields and fields Ai) only the combination of LAi and a PQ-nonsinglet LAjAk can cause a problem. Of course this depends on the VEV's of the A's. As we will see from the examples, it is possible to forbid either of these two if we do not want to introduce too many fields. Dangerous d = 7 operators generally appear in the pure Ai-sector. To make a concrete discussion, let us take a μ-term HA21 and a superpotential W = (A1A2  -  f2a)Y. As a consequence of the second anomaly-free condition in eq. ([\ref=anomalies]), one finds the allowed operators : A6i or A51A*2, etc. Now we have to worry about the PQ-nonsinglet operators in the scalar potential like a51a*2y*. It can be obtained from the terms A1A2Y and A61 in the superpotential. At first glance, it does not make a problem since < Y >   =  0 in the global SUSY case. But if we take account of the full supergravity Lagrangian, the field Y can develop a VEV of the order of fp + 1 / Mppl. Here p can depend on the specific form of the superpotential [\cite=ch_ki_ni]. For instance, the above superpotential gives p  =  1. So, one has to take a superpotential which gives p  ≥  3 to protect the axion solution. From this, we favor a very light axino (mass ≤  10- 4eV) since its mass is proportional to < Y > .

Now we turn to B-, L-number. The discrete gauge symmetries can be classified according to the allowed pattern of the B-, L-violating standard terms LQd,LLe and udd [\cite=ibanez_ross] :

[formula]

Proton decay safety on higher dimensional standard operators is ensured if QQQL,uude and the combinations (udd,QueH / QuL* / ud*e) and (LQd,QQQH) are forbidden. This is fulfilled for all our symmetries in eq. ([\ref=symm]) ! Additionally new B-, L-violating operators can appear by adding singlet fields Ai. The combinations (LQdApi,uddAqj) with p + q  ≤  3 should be nonsinglets under discrete symmetry to avoid fast proton decay. Interesting patterns of allowed and forbidden B- and L-violating operators with dimension ≤  5 appear if all charges α(Ai) are multiples of 3. This is always the case if the coupling HA21 is demanded to be present. But also for HA1A2 there exists a class of superpotentials with this property. We define c = m mod 3. Then for r mod 3  ≠  0 three patterns of operators occur two of them automatically lead to a proton decay safe theory (see table [\ref=tab_:_op_patterns]). For r mod 3 = 0 all operators can be allowed in the case c = 0 whereas in the opposite case all operators are forbidden. The k-values in terms of the class c are given by

[formula]

We saw that certain discrete symmetries can allow L-violation. In this class of symmetries neutrino masses can be generated with the fields Ai serving as RHN's. The relevant couplings are the following :

[formula]

[formula]

The last two terms - if present - can produce neutrino masses O(10- 5) eV (the last term only one mass of this order). With this in mind we neglect them in the following diagonalization procedure. The mass matrix of f = (νi,h̃,,) can be read off from the above couplings :

[formula]

Neglecting again contributions O(10- 5) eV one can diagonalize this matrix in three steps : rotating away the ν  -  -mixing, diagonalizing MM and applying see-saw mechanism for all "large" eigenvalues of MM. Then we arrive at :

[formula]

The diagonalized matrix MM has been divided into three parts : the axion and very small eigenvalue (≪  m3 / 2) part Â, the small eigenvalue part Ŝ with eigenvalues [formula] and the large eigenvalue part L̂ with eigenvalues O(fa). The other matrices have been divided into the corresponding parts. The equations show that the couplings LiAj may only be present if the VEV of Aj is small ([formula]) and Aj does not mix with the light eigenmodes in the Ŝ- and Â-sector. Under these assumptions the matrices DA and DS are at most of the order fam3 / 2 / M  ~   keV. The application of the see-saw mechanism for DS is then justified. From the matrix ([\ref=diag_matrix]) the following conclusions can be drawn :

In general DA will be nonzero if couplings LAA are present. Then the axino mass determines the mass of one neutrino mode. For a light axino mass (≪   keV) a keV-Dirac-neutrino (ν,ã) appears. Though there are some hints for a 17-keV-neutrino experimental results [\cite=17_keV_exp] as well as cosmological implications [\cite=17_keV_cosm] disfavor this possibility. For an axino mass in the keV-range a keV-Majorana-neutrino is present which is excluded by neutrino-less double beta decay. It remains the possibility of a heavy axino (O(102 GeV)) generating a Majorana neutrino mass of O(10- 3) eV. This is the correct order for the MSW-solution [\cite=msw] of the solar neutrino problem. However, the last possibility which is favorable from the viewpoint of neutrino physics is in danger to spoil the axion solution as discussed.

Couplings LA can be present under the above requirements. Together with the see-saw mechanism they lead to O(eV) Majorana neutrinos (for couplings O(1)).

Apart from these mechanisms neutrino masses relevant for the solar neutrino problem can be generated only by see-saw suppression through light fields Ai : If DS is of O(fam3 / 2 / M)  ~   keV then Ai masses of O(m3 / 2) lead to masses O(f2am3 / 2 / M2)  ~  10- 3 eV (for large fa, fa  ~  1012 GeV). A possible source of a mass of O(m3 / 2) can be radiative corrections [\cite=my].

The couplings LL cause Majorana neutrino masses of O(10- 5 eV) in general for all flavors. The coupling LH can generate only one mass of this order.

Neutrinos with mass O(eV) which can be candidates for Dark Matter can be achieved in two ways. According to the first remark the scale fa  ~  1012 GeV can combine with an axino mass ([formula] GeV). Alternatively the superpotential can allow for a see-saw suppression by a scale of O(fa) as in the second remark.

Remarkably solving the solar-neutrino-problem via masses as discussed or via LQd [\cite=LQd] is only possible for the second pattern in table [\ref=tab_:_op_patterns]. Proton decay safety follows then automatically.

Before going to the examples let us discuss the relation of the automatic PQ-idea and the Kim-type realization of axion. The essential coupling for the Kim-axion K1A1K2 (where K1 and K2 are heavy quarks) leads to the following parameterization of charges : α(K1) =  - p + q, α(K2) =  - p - q, α(A1) = 2p. The anomaly cancelation conditions read

[formula]

A difficulty in implementing the Kim-axion is that the model is in danger to possess an additional DFS-PQ-symmetry. Then the introduction of additional quarks and moreover the whole Kim-PQ-mechanism is superfluous. One possibility to avoid this is to forget about solving μ-problem and demand H to be present. But in this case n = 0 and the anomaly free conditions imply α(A1) = 0. So there is no chance for automatic PQ. On the other hand, if n  ≠  0 at least one coupling T which is invariant under discrete n-symmetry but noninvariant under the corresponding global U(1) is required : α(T) = sn = s'N  (s  ≠  0) and αU(1)(T)  ≠  0. Now for all small values of s (s = 3 / 2,2,5 / 2..) the anomaly cancelation conditions show that some small power of A1 is allowed. But the generation of large s-values leads to complicated potentials and the introduction of many fields Ai. We conclude that an automatic pure Kim-PQ extension of the SSM cannot be implemented in an easy way.

Now we discuss all acceptable potentials W for N = 9,18 up to four fields Ai. Later we will give one example for N = 36 which naturally can allow three couplings LNi . The superpotential W should have the following general properties : The superpotential is the most general one compatible with its discrete symmetry. Of course it should admit a PQ-symmetry. The discrete charges α(Ai) should satisfy the constraint [formula]. To force the PQ-fields responsible for the μ-term to get a nonvanishing VEV the existence of a field Y with α(Y) = 0 is necessary. Finally, supersymmetry is supposed to be unbroken in the sector of singlet fields Ai. One can assume the Polony form for the supersymmetry breaking.

Let us first consider the case with N = 9. Here we have r = 1. We allow the coupling HA1A2 assuming the discrete charges of the A's to be α(A1,A2)  =  ( - 1, - 2) . The anomaly free condition in eq. ([\ref=anomalies]) allows the solutions k  =  3x for an integer x given by m  =  2 - x (mod 3). We find that our minimal choice for the superpotential requires two more fields with α(A3,A4)  =  (1,2). Dropping the cubic and quadratic term for Y, the corresponding superpotential reads :

[formula]

where f  ~  fa. This corresponds to k = 0.

From the previous discussion we know that certain combinations of B- and L-violating operators should be avoided ((LQdAp,uddAq) with p + q  ≤  3, L, LA). For any m at least one of these operators is allowed. Since we can hardly expect that introducing more fields can avoid this difficulty, we exclude the possibility for Z9 symmetry.

The next examples are the Z18 symmetries with r = 2. The values of k,m follow the pattern k  =  3x, m  =  1 - x (mod 3) for an integer x. We now introduce a PQ-field A1 with discrete charge - 3 to allow the coupling HA21. Automatic PQ-symmetry requires α(Ai)  ≠    ±  6 for all PQ-fields. In agreement with table [\ref=tab_:_op_patterns], we find three classes of symmetries which share the similar phenomenological property : (I) m  =  1 mod 3; k = 0,9 : The minimal choice of the PQ-fields can be achieved by taking two fields A1,A2 with α(A1,A2)  =  ( - 3,3). Then we take the superpotential W  =  (λA1A2  -  f2)Y  +  mNN2, where f≃mN≃fa. The presence of the field N is necessary to achieve k = 9. One finds that this class of discrete symmetries allows no d = 5 operators. Therefore, B- and L-symmetry are insured quite strongly. (II) m  =  0 mod 3; k = 3, - 6 : For this case we need three fields with α(A1,A2,A3)  =  ( - 3,3,3) for k =  - 3 and one more field N for k =  - 6. The corresponding superpotential can be read off from eq. ([\ref=three]) by exchanging A1 and A3. As expected, this class of discrete symmetries respects L-invariance. But B-violation can appear in renormalizable terms or in the higher dimensional operators with PQ-fields. For instance, the discrete symmetry allows udd, uddN, Q3H, uddA2,3 and uddA1 for m = 8,3,6,9 and - 3 respectively. (III) m  =  2 mod 3; k =  - 3,6 : In this case, we have three fields with α(A1,A2,A3)  =  ( - 3, - 3,3) for k =  - 3 and one more field N for k = 6. One can build two superpotentials satisfying our general requirement,

[formula]

The first superpotential has two massless multiplets : λ2A1  -  λ1A2 and the axion multiplet. In the global SUSY case, the VEV of the first multiplet is not determined. But it is set to be 0 if a supergravity Lagrangian with minimal kinetic terms and a vanishing cosmological constant is considered. The second one gives nontrivial VEV's to all the PQ fields and only one massless (axion) multiplet is present. These features become important for neutrino physics.

Contrary to the above case, B-invariance is now insured. We discard the cases with m  =  2 and 5, - 1 since they allow either L or LAi. The L-violating operators are LQd, LLe and LA21,2 for m = 8; LA23 and LH for m =  - 4; LN, LQdA1,2, LLeA1,2 and LL for m =  - 7. According to the general discussion the neutrino masses in this three cases behave as follows : (i) m = 8, - 4 : As discussed before, the field Y can get a VEV of order of 102 GeV to produce a heavy axino. Then, there may appear one neutrino with mass O(10- 3) eV for the both cases in eq. ([\ref=three])) and one keV-Dirac neutrino for the first case only. However, this large < Y >  spoils the axion solution. To avoid this, we need a superpotential with sufficiently small gravity-corrected VEV < Y > . This may result in two (one) keV Dirac neutrino for the first (second) superpotential. In this minimal example, we cannot, therefore, achieve the desirable features for neutrino masses. (ii) m =  - 7 : If the field N is present (k = 6) it is the only one which can couple to L. It leads to one Majorana neutrino with mass O(eV). Here we can take a small VEV < Y >  to protect the axion solution without arriving at a keV-Dirac neutrino. Due to the allowed coupling LL the other neutrino modes will have in general mass O(10- 5) eV.

Up to now, we discussed the simple case with one PQ-field coupled to H. If the term HA1A2 is forced to be allowed we find that - as in the Z9-case - at least four PQ-fields are necessary to build the potential. For α(A1) = 3,9,15 all charges α(Ai) are multiples of three and the classification of operator patterns from the general part is applicable. We find four types of minimal potentials which cover the three possible patterns of allowed and forbidden operators. For α(A1)  ≠  3,9,15 the only minimal potential is given by eq. ([\ref=z9_potential]) with Z18-symmetry. Because of the extended symmetry it cannot be ruled out as in the Z9-case.

We saw that the most promising way of generating neutrino masses without spoiling the axion solution is to introduce couplings LN. In eq. ([\ref=three]) the mass of the right-handed neutrino was put in by hand. Now we construct an example which shows a relation between the axion scale and the right-handed neutrino scale. For this, let us go to the Z36 symmetry. We take PQ-fields whose discrete charges are given by α(A1,2,A3,N1,2,3)  =  ( - 6,6,3). This allows us to build a superpotential W  =  (λ1A1A3  +  λ2A2A3  -  f2)Y  +  hiA3N2i with k = 3. Now the discrete symmetry with m = 1 permits the desired coupling LiNj and forbids any d = 5 operators as well as B- and L-violating d = 4 operators. One finds that the masses of right-handed neutrinos are given by hi < A3  >  . Irrespectively of < Y >  the axino receives a radiative-corrected mass of O(102) GeV by the coupling A3N2i [\cite=my].

We finish our discussion with some remarks about generation dependent discrete symmetries. The leptonic charge corresponding to l is split into three generation parts li. Only the SU(2) anomaly cancelation condition changes : L  +  n  =  0 with [formula]. The "automatic" requirement n  ≠  0 leads to N = 3r, n = r and L =  - r. So generation dependency lowers the smallest N which admits automatic PQ to N = 6. The potentials for N = 6 are our N = 18 potentials from the generation independent case. As in the generation independent case HA21 is forbidden for N = 3i. Since n is not necessarily a multiple of 3 any more the operator classification for the term HA21 is not valid. Only if N = 9r this is still satisfied and general conclusions can be made : There exist two types of (mod 3)-combinations of the li : generation independent : (l1,l2,l3)   mod  3 = (0,0,0),(1,1,1),(2,2,2) generation dependent :(l1,l2,l3)   mod  3 = (1,2,0) + perm. Apart from Q3L and u2de which were forbidden in the generation independent case table [\ref=tab_:_op_patterns] remains valid for the B-violating operators. The L-violating operators with only one leptonic family index are allowed for m + li mod 3 = 0. Eq. ([\ref=k_values]) gives the corresponding values of k. Consequently for the second type only one neutrino flavor can receive "large" masses by one of the mechanisms discussed. Interestingly this generation dependent symmetries differ from the so called type II symmetries (i. e. l1 = l3  ≠  l2) [\cite=kap_mayr_nilles] necessary to solve the solar neutrino problem by allowing L1,3Qd.

In conclusion we discussed axionic extensions of the SSM with a discrete gauge symmetry to stabilize PQ-, B- and L-invariance. Our requirement of an automatic PQ-symmetry excluded the Kim-type axion. This led us to implementing the DFS-type axion and to solving the μ-problem. We showed that a certain class of ZN symmetries with N = 9r can ensure proton stability and simultaneously protect the axion solution. To suppress the effect from higher dimensional operators a small tree-level axino mass (< O(10- 4) eV) is favored. For a μ-term HA21 we found three classes of discrete symmetries which show characteristic patterns of B- and L-violating operators. One pattern of them allows only L-violating operators

For this class two sources of neutrino masses, namely LAA and LN, were discussed. They represent different types of neutrino-axion connections with RHN scales m3 / 2 and fa, respectively. If LAA is present in general one neutrino mass is fixed by the mass of the axino. This excludes an axino mass O(keV) resulting in a keV-Majorana neutrino. An axino mass of O(m3 / 2) can generate a favorable neutrino mass of O(10- 3) eV though the axino solution is in danger. On the other hand a low axino mass leads to a keV-Dirac neutrino. Therefore we preferred the coupling LN. A term AN2 in the superpotential then can produce a RHN mass mN  ~  fa leading to Majorana neutrinos with mass of O(eV). The axino receives a one loop radiative mass ~  m3 / 2 which contrary to the tree level mass does not effect the axion solution. One model with this aspect was constructed for Z36.

For the two simplest symmetries Z9 and Z18 we discussed all acceptable superpotentials with less than five PQ-fields Ai. The Z9 symmetry turned out to be incompatible with our requirements. In the Z18 case we gave examples for each of the three operator patterns and the above aspects of neutrino-axion connections.
