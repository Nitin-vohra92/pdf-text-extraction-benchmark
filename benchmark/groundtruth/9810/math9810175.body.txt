Recently, Saleh [\cite=S1] claimed to have solved 'a long standing open question' in Topology; namely, he proved that every almost continuous function is closure continuous (= θ-continuous). Unfortunately, this problem was settled long time ago and even a better result is known. Consider the following implications:

Cont. ⇒   Almost cont. ⇒   Almost α-cont. ⇒   η-cont. ⇒   θ-cont. ⇒   Weakly cont.

The first two implications are trivial. In [\cite=N1], the second author showed that every almost α-continuous function is η-continuous. In [\cite=D1], Dickman, Porter and Rubin proved that every η-continuous is θ-continuous and hence weakly continuous.

Although θ-continuous functions behave, in general, nicely, they may cause some unexpected problems. For example, if f:X  →  Y is θ-continuous, then f:X  →  f(X) is not necessarily θ-continuous. Also, the set of all points of continuity of f:X  →  Y may be dense in X and f may not be weakly continuous in either of those points. We show that with the following example:

Example. Consider the classical Dirichlet function [formula], where [formula] is the real line with the density topology τd:

[formula]

It is easily observed that f is continuous at every irrational point (furthermore, [formula], the set of all irrationals is dense in the density topology). On the other hand f is not weakly continuous (and hence not θ-continuous) at any irrational point.
