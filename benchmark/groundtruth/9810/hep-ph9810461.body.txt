Introduction

I consider the motion equations for fermions with nonzero masses without Higgs with all five elements of Clifford's pentad. And i reform the motion equation for components W-field as equation, similar to the nonzero Klein-Gordon equation.

Notations:

[formula]

[formula]

the Pauli matrices:

[formula]

if ϑ is the 4  ×  4 matrix then

[formula]

A set [formula] of complex n  ×  n matrices is denoted as Clifford's set [\cite=Md] if the following conditions are fulfilled:

if [formula] and [formula] then αkαr  +  αrαk = 2δk,r;

if αkαr  +  αrαk = 2δk,r for all elements αr of [formula] then [formula].

If n = 4 then Clifford's set either contains 3 matrices (Clifford's triplet) or contains 5 matrices (Clifford's pentad).

For example: Clifford pentad β:

Fermions

Let the motion equation (Dirac equation) for the free fermion be in the following form:

[formula]

The motion equation for two independent fermions with masses m1 and m2 (a two-fermion state) is of the following:

[formula]

with

[formula]

This equation is not invariant for the SU(2) isospin transformation

[formula]

with

[formula]

because it holds four, only, elements of the Clifford pentad.

If ∂μU = U∂μ then the equation with all five elements

[formula]

is invariant for the following transformation:

[formula]

with

[formula]

[formula]

In this transformation the value of m25 + m24 is invariant.

Hence we have got the two-fermion motion equation, invariant for global weak isospin transformation, with nonzero nonHiggs mass.

If g is a real number, W0,μ, W1,μ,W2,μ are real scalar functions on the 3+1 space-time and

[formula]

then the equation

[formula]

is invariant for the local weak isospin transformation:

[formula]

Bosons

The motion equation of the Yang-Mills SU(2) field in the space without matter (for instance [\cite=Sd] or [\cite=Rd] ) has got the following form:

[formula]

with:

[formula]

and

[formula]

Hence the motion equation for W0,μ is the following:

[formula]

W1,μ and W2,μ satisfy to similar equations.

This equation can be reformed as the following:

[formula]

This equation looks like to the Klein-Gordon equation of field W0,μ with mass

[formula]

and with the additional terms of the W0,μ interactions with others components of [formula].

"Mass" ([\ref=z10]) is invariant for the following transformations:

[formula]

[formula]

with a real number λ, and [formula], and [formula],

and ([\ref=z10]) is invariant for a global weak isospin transformation U:

[formula]

but is not invariant for a local transformation U:

[formula]

Equation ([\ref=b]) can be simplified as follows:

[formula]

(here no of summation over indexes νν; the summation is expressed by [formula] ) with g0,0 = 1, g1,1 = g2,2 = g3,3 =  - 1.

In this equation the form

[formula]

varies in space, but it does not contain W0,μ and locally acts as mass - i.e. it does not allow to particles of this field to behave as a massless ones.

Hence if Higgs exist then mass, calculated with Higgs, should be corrected with this "mass". If Higgs do not exist then this "mass" turns out to be the only reason, giving a W-boson nonzero mass in measurements [\cite=Kla].

Therefore the W fields should behave as the massive fields with Higgs or without Higgs.

Conclusion

Therefore Higgs are not necessary for the nonzero leptons' and bosons' masses.
