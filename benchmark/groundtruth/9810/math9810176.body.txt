A topological space (X,τ) is called extremally disconnected [\cite=St1] if the closure of every open set is open. Recently, Pyrih [\cite=P1] defined a space X to be open-normal if for any two disjoint open sets A and B there exist disjoint closed sets FA and FB such that A  ⊂  FA and B  ⊂  FB. He asked if every open-normal space is discrete. The answer to his question is no.

Proposition 1. A topological space (X,τ) is open-normal if and only if it is extremally disconnected.

Proof. Assume first that X is open-normal. Let A be an open subset of X. Then, A and [formula] are disjoint open sets and hence there exist disjoint closed sets FA and FB such that A  ⊂  FA and B  ⊂  FB. Clearly, FA  =  cl(A) and FB  =  B. Hence, [formula] is open. Thus, X is extremally disconnected.

Assume next that X is extremally disconnected. If A and B are disjoint open subsets of X, then cl(A) and [formula] are disjoint open sets containing A and B respectively. [formula]

It is well-known that there exist extremally disconnected non-discrete spaces: the Stone-ech compactification of every discrete space, etc. A detailed bibliography on the recent progress of the study of extremally disconnected spaces may be found in [\cite=DR1].

In [\cite=P1], Pyrih proved that every extremally disconnected metric space is discrete. A much better result exists. In [\cite=G1], Gleason proved that every convergent sequence [formula] of an extremally disconnected Hausdorff space is stationary. Recall that a sequence [formula] is called stationary if for some n, we have [formula]. As a consequence of Gleason's result we have the following:

Proposition 2. Every sequential Hausdorff space which is extremally disconnected is discrete.

Note that the following implications hold and none of them is reversible:

Metric ⇒   First countable and Hausdorff ⇒   Fréchet and Hausdorff ⇒   Sequential and Hausdorff.
