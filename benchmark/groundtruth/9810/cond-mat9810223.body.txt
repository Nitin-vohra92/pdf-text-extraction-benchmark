In recent years the statistics of energy eigenvalues has become an important tool for investigating the localization properties of disordered electronic systems [\cite=Efe83] [\cite=AS86]. In most cases the Anderson model or one of its variants were used to describe the behavior of non-interacting electrons in three-dimensional disordered systems which possess orthogonal [\cite=AZKS88] [\cite=Sea93] [\cite=HS93a] [\cite=HoS94a] [\cite=Eva94] [\cite=ZK95a] [\cite=ZK95b] [\cite=ZK97], unitary [\cite=HoS94b] [\cite=BSZK96] [\cite=DBZK98], and symplectic [\cite=KOSO96] symmetry. Also two-dimensional systems with orthogonal [\cite=ZBK96] [\cite=Cea98], symplectic [\cite=SZ95] [\cite=Eva95] [\cite=SZ97], and unitary (random flux) [\cite=BSK98] symmetry have been studied. Even in the quantum Hall case (strong magnetic field) [\cite=HS92] [\cite=OO95] [\cite=FAB95] [\cite=BS97] level statistics was used to examine the localization properties.

It has been shown that in the limit of infinite system size, L  →    ∞  , the statistics of the uncorrelated eigenvalues in the insulating regime is specified by the Poisson form whereas in the diffusive regime the correlations of energy eigenvalues are well described [\cite=Efe83] by random matrix theory (RMT), see e. g., [\cite=Meh91] [\cite=GMW98]. There are, however, also known deviations [\cite=AS86] [\cite=KM94] [\cite=BM95] from the universal RMT results. These deviations arise when the mean level spacing Δ is equal or larger than the Thouless energy Ec  =  2 which is the inverse of the classical diffusion time. The discrepancy is not really astonishing because the respective Hamilton matrix for the Anderson model with its large number of zeros is quite different from the random matrices considered in RMT [\cite=Wig51] [\cite=Dys62] [\cite=Meh91].

Nevertheless, the success of extracting the critical properties that govern the localization-delocalization transition directly from level statistics [\cite=Sea93] [\cite=HoS94a] [\cite=BM95] [\cite=BS97] [\cite=SZ97] has stimulated detailed investigations of the new class of critical level statistics. In contrast to the metallic and insulating phases where the level statistics assume their respective universal form in the limit of infinite system size, the critical P(s) was found to be scale invariant.

In particular, results on the energy spacing distribution of successive eigenvalues, P(s), where s = |Ei + 1 - Ei| / Δ, have been frequently reported in the literature. Until recently the form of the critical P(s) was known only from numerical studies. However, the promising recent progress of analytical theories [\cite=AKL95] [\cite=CLS96] [\cite=CKL96] [\cite=Can96] [\cite=Nis99] will help to understand the critical eigenvalue correlations and to clarify the supposed relation [\cite=AZKS88] between the large-s decay of P(s) and the level number variance, Σ2(〈N〉) = χ〈N〉, which was shown to be connected with the multifractal exponent D(2) of the critical eigenstates via χ = d - D(2) / (2d) [\cite=CKL96].

Even in two-dimensional quantum Hall effect (QHE) systems, where the localization length diverges at singular energies in the center of the Landau bands and no complete localization-delocalization transition exists (absence of an energy range of extended states), critical level statistics can still be observed [\cite=HS92] [\cite=OO95] [\cite=FAB95] [\cite=BS97].

Recently, the eigenvalue statistics directly at the transition was shown to depend on the boundary conditions in 3d orthogonal [\cite=BMP98] and 2d symplectic systems [\cite=SP98], and also on the shape of the 3d sample [\cite=PS98]. For a QHE system, however, it has been suggested [\cite=EK98] that the dependence of the level statistics on the boundary conditions is absent when an appropriate shift of the critical energy is taken into account. In the following we address the question, whether the critical level statistics of the QHE system behaves differently to a change of the boundary conditions.

The two-dimensional system of non-interacting electrons in the presence of impurity scattering and a strong perpendicular magnetic field can be described [\cite=SKM84a] by a tight-binding Hamiltonian on a square lattice with diagonal disorder. The magnetic field enters via complex phases in the transfer terms that cause the electronic motion within the xy-plane. In the Landau gauge the vector potential is taken as A = (0,Bx,0) which results in a magnetic flux density in the z-direction. The Hamilton matrix is

[formula]

where a = 1 and V = 1 are taken as the unit of length and energy, respectively. The magnetic field B is chosen to be commensurate with the lattice and αB = a2eB / h denotes the number of flux quanta per plaquette. The boundary conditions are changed from periodic (PBC) to Dirichlet (DBC) by setting V = 0 along the edges. The diagonal disorder potentials ε(x,y) are a set of independent random numbers drawn from an interval, - W / 2  ≤  ε  ≤  W / 2, with constant probability density 1 / W.

Square systems of size L / a = 64, 96, 128, 256 are considered with disorder strength W / V = 2.5. Taking αB = 1 / 8, the ratio of system size L to the magnetic length l = (1 / 2 is about 201 for the largest samples. The corresponding large sparse hermitian matrices were directly diagonalized by means of a Lanczos algorithm based on [\cite=CW85] which was adapted to run efficiently on DEC-Alpha workstations. Many realizations of the disorder potentials were calculated so that the number of accumulated eigenvalues within a narrow interval around the critical energy of the lowest Landau band exceeded 2  ·  105 even for L / a = 256. A spectral unfolding procedure was applied in order to eliminate global changes in the density of states.

As mentioned in the introduction, the critical disorder Wc which defines the position of the divergence of the correlation length, ξ(W)  ~  |W - Wc|-  ν, does not change significantly in 3d orthogonal [\cite=BMP98] and 2d symplectic [\cite=SP98] systems when the periodic boundary conditions (PBC) are replaced by Dirichlet boundary conditions (DBC). At Wc and for finite systems, there exists a broad energy interval for which the localization length exceeds the system size L so that these states show critical behavior. For the 2d QHE-System, on the other hand, the divergence of the localization length, λ  ~  |E - En|-  ν, takes place at the positions of the critical energies, En(W), which depend on the disorder strength. Therefore, only a small critical energy window around En exists where λ(E) >  > L.

To determine the position of the critical energy in the lowest Landau band, E0, we have calculated the energy dependence of the second moment I0(E,L) of the level spacing distribution, [formula], for PBC and DBC. The minimum of I0 indicates the position of E0 which is shown in Fig. [\ref=I0_E_L] for disorder W / V = 2.5. While the energetic position of the minimum of I0 does not change with the system size L for PBC, a pronounced shift is visible in the case of DBC. The reason for the shift originates in the edge states which are introduced by the application of DBC. However, their influence on the level statistics vanishes with increasing system size. This is shown in the inset of Fig. [\ref=I0_E_L] where the difference [formula] between the energetic positions of the minimum of I0 for DBC and PBC is plotted. There, also the difference δI min = IPBC min - IDBC min(L) in the corresponding values of I0 is shown. While the energetic position of IDBC min moves towards E / V =  - 3.33 found for PBC, the absolute value seems to saturate at IDBC min = 0.592 which is smaller than the calculated IPBC min = 0.6.

Now, we address the question, whether the critical level spacing distributions differ for different boundary conditions. In Fig. [\ref=pofs] the semi-logarithmic plots of P(s) are shown for PBC with system size L / a = 128 and for DBC with L / a = 256. A small, but significant difference is observed between the curves for PBC and DBC for spacings s  >  2. In contrast to the 3d orthogonal and the 2d symplectic case the large-s slope is steeper for DBC than for PBC in the QHE system. Within the numerical uncertainty of our data, no size dependence could be detected for P(s) with PBC in the range from L / a = 32 to 128 and for DBC in the range L / a = 128 up to 256. Therefore, we have to conclude that for the QHE system in the limit L  →    ∞   the critical distributions are different for PBC and DBC, but the critical energies are the same. The reason for this peculiar behavior presumably originates in the different topology of the systems [\cite=KY98]. However, in order to detect the small difference in P(s), strong finite size effects have to be overcome. The latter are due to the appearance of extended edge states that reside along the boundaries of the QHE system when DBC are applied.
