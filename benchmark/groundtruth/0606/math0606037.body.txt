Rank One Perturbations and the Zeros of Paraorthogonal Polynomials on the Unit Circle

Introduction

This note concerns an aspect of the theory of orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle (OPUC); for background, see [\cite=Szb] [\cite=GBk1] [\cite=OPUC1] [\cite=OPUC2] [\cite=1Ft]. Given a nontrivial probability measure, dμ, on [formula], we let Φn(z) (we use Φn(z,dμ) when dμ needs to be explicit) be the monic orthogonal polynomials. They obey the Szeg recursion relations

[formula]

where [formula] are the Verblunsky coefficients. dμ  ↔  {αn}∞n = 0 sets up a one-one correspondence between [formula] and nontrivial probability measures (Verblunsky's theorem).

Given [formula], the paraorthogonal polynomials (POPUC) are defined by (Note: [\cite=OPUC1] uses β where [\eqref=1.3] uses -  ; [\eqref=1.3] is the right convention.)

[formula]

More generally, we will consider a sequence [formula] and

[formula]

POPUC were introduced at least as early as Jones, Njåstad, and Thron [\cite=JNT89]. About five years ago, Cantero, Moral, and Velázquez [\cite=CMV02] and Golinskii [\cite=Gol02] realized that zeros of POPUC shared many properties of zeros of OPRL and independently proved a number of basic results about these zeros. Cantero et al. [\cite=CMV06] recently proved additional results. The basic tool in [\cite=CMV02] [\cite=Gol02] is the Christoffel-Darboux formula; [\cite=CMV06] also exploits the CMV matrix. Our goal in this paper is to use the theory of rank one perturbations of unitary matrices to recover many of the basic results about zeros of POPUC and prove some new results. In particular, we will illuminate the issue of interlacing of the zeros of successive POPUC.

First, some notation. Given distinct [formula], (z,w) is the set of points, ζ, in [formula] with

[formula]

where a branch of [formula] is chosen so [formula]. An ordered set of points [formula] is called cyclicly ordered if each [formula] and [formula] contain no other zj's. The ordering is fixed by such cyclicity up to a single choice. We will always assume zeros of POPUC are cyclicly ordered.

Two cyclicly ordered sets [formula] and [formula] in [formula] are said to strictly interlace if after a cyclic permutation of the w's, we have wj∈(zj,zj + 1), [formula], [formula]. This, of course, implies zj∈(wj - 1,wj), [formula] and [formula].

For {αj}∞j = 0, the second kind polynomials, Ψn(z,dμ) are defined, as usual, to be the Φn's associated to α̃j  =    -  αj(dμ). We define

[formula]

We can now state our main results:

If (w0,w1) is an interval disjoint from [formula], then for any choice of β and any n, Φn(z,dμ;β) has at most one zero in (w0,w1).

The following has also been proven by Wong [\cite=Wong]:

Let [formula] be the zeros of some Φn(z,dμ;β) and [formula] of Ψn(z,dμ;  -  β). Note: -  β, not β. Then these zeros strictly interlace.

Fix dμ and n and distinct β,β' in [formula]. Then the zeros of Φn(z,dμ;β) and Φn(z,dμ;β') strictly interlace.

The power of our approach is shown by the refined version we obtain relating zeros of n + 1 and n. We will need the following computed sequence in [formula]:

[formula]

For each n, one of two possibilities holds:

If [formula] have a common zero at λ, then βn are given inductively by

[formula]

[formula]. Then βn  =  λ̄n and n(z) = zn  -  λn precisely the POPs with a zero at λ for all n.

The key to our proofs is the connection of n to CMV matrices {[\cite=CMV] [\cite=OPUC1] [\cite=Evansproc]. n is the determinant of a suitable finite CMV matrix, and so its zeros are the eigenvalues. All our results concern what happens to eigenvalues of unitary matrices under rank one perturbations. Section [\ref=s2] discusses general rank one perturbations, and Section [\ref=s3] the application to POPUC.

It is a pleasure to thank Mará José Cantero and Lilian Wong for useful discussions.

Rank One Perturbations

Rank one perturbations of unitaries are discussed in Sections 1.3.9, 1.4.16, 3.2, 4.5, and 10.16 of [\cite=OPUC1] [\cite=OPUC2], and some of the results in this section are spread through that material.

If U and V are two unitaries on a finite- or infinite-dimensional Hilbert space and U - V is rank one, we pick a unit vector [formula] and note there must be a [formula] with

[formula]

and thus

[formula]

It is convenient to define for [formula] and A unitary:

[formula]

F is a Carathéodory function ([formula] on [formula], F(0) = 1) and f a Schur function ([formula] on [formula]). The spectral measure for A,φ is given by

[formula]

It is not hard to see that

Let φ be a cyclic vector for a unitary A i.e., {Akφ}∞k =  -   ∞ is total. An interval (w0,w1) in [formula] is disjoint from [formula] if and only if f has an analytic continuation through (w0,w1) with [formula] on that interval. In that case,

[formula] is increasing since [formula] in [formula] and [formula] on (w0,w1) implies [formula] on (w0,w1). So by the Cauchy-Riemann equations, [formula]. (b) holds since

[formula]

has poles at points where [\eqref=2.6] holds.

When [\eqref=2.2] holds, a direct calculation (see (1.4.90) and the end of Section 3.2 in [\cite=OPUC1]) shows that

If [\eqref=2.2] holds, then

[formula]

We immediately have

Let [\eqref=2.2] hold. If [formula], then V has at most one eigenvalue in

[formula]

Let K be the cyclic subspace for U and φ. Since U = V on [formula] which is invariant for both, we can suppose φ is cyclic. In that case, picking z0∈(w0,w1) and then [formula] so [formula], we see [formula] on all of (w0,w1) since [\eqref=2.6] has no solution there. By the strict monotonicity of [formula], zf(z) = λ has at most one solution in

[formula]

Let U,V be unitaries on [formula] so [\eqref=2.2] holds for λ  ≠  1 and for φ cyclic for U. Then the eigenvalues of U and V strictly interlace.

Since U has a cyclic vector, its spectrum is simple so zf(z) = 1 has n solutions. Since [formula] is strictly monotone, zf(z) = λ has n solutions which interlace the solutions of zf(z) = 1.

One can say something about the case where φ is not cyclic.

Let U,V be unitaries on [formula] so [\eqref=2.2] holds. Let z0,z1 be two eigenvalues of U. Then V has an eigenvalue in

[formula]

Let K be the cyclic subspace of (U,φ) which is invariant for U. If z0 and z1 are eigenvalues of [formula], V has an eigenvalue in (z0,z1) by Proposition [\ref=P2.4]. If not, since [formula], either z0 or z1 is an eigenvalue of V.

Finally, we have a specialized result that is precisely what we need to prove Theorem [\ref=T1.4]:

Let [formula] on [formula], two finite-dimensional subspaces of H, a space of dimension n. Let φj j = 1,2 be cyclic vectors for Uj on Kj. Let [formula] where (a,b)  ≠  (0,0) and [formula]. Let V be given by [\eqref=2.2] with λ  ≠  1. If U1 and U2 have [formula] eigenvalues in common, then V has these [formula] common values as eigenvalues and its other [formula] eigenvalues strictly interlace those of U.

Since φj is cyclic for Uj, any simple eigenvalue of U is in the cyclic subspace generated by U,φ. Moreover, any common eigenvalue is a simple eigenvalue for [formula] where K  =   cyclic subspace of φ. Thus [formula] has all the eigenvalues of U but with multiplicity 1. The eigenvalues of [formula] strictly interlace by Proposition [\ref=P2.4]. The eigenvalues of [formula] are exactly the common eigenvalues.

φ is cyclic if and only if [formula].

Zeros of POPUC and Finite CMV Matrices

Given a sequence {γn}∞n = 0 of elements in [formula], one defines the CMV matrix C({γn}∞n = 0) on [formula] by

[formula]

where [formula] is the one-dimensional identity matrix, and Θ is given by

[formula]

It is a fundamental result of Cantero, Moral, and Velázquez [\cite=CMV] (see also [\cite=OPUC1]) and see [\cite=Evansproc] for other references) that if dμ is a nontrivial probability measure on [formula], χn is the basis of [formula] obtained by applying Gram-Schmidt to [formula], and αn(dμ) are the Verblunsky coefficients of dμ, then C({αn(dμ)}∞n = 0) is the matrix of multiplication by z on [formula] in χn basis. Note in this case that [formula] (rather than some [formula]), in which case we call C a proper CMV matrix.

If [formula], then τ = 0, and Θ(γ) is a direct sum of two 1  ×  1 matrices, and so, if [formula], C breaks into a direct sum of an n  ×  n matrix and an infinite piece. The finite piece, [formula], is called a finite CMV matrix. It is not hard to show that (see, e.g., [\cite=Evansproc]):

If [formula] for all n, then [formula] is a cyclic vector for C({γn}∞n = 0). If [formula], [formula], then δ0 is a cyclic vector for Cn({γm}n - 1m = 0).

Moreover (see [\cite=OPUC1]),

If [formula] and [formula], then

[formula]

In particular, the zeros of n are the eigenvalues of a finite CMV matrix.

Finally, we need the following, which generalizes Lemma 4.5.1 of [\cite=OPUC1]:

Let [formula] and [formula]. Then

[formula]

is rank one if and only if

[formula]

A 2  ×  2 matrix is rank one if and only if det (A) = 0. Since

[formula]

we see [\eqref=3.7] is rank one if and only if [formula], which is solved by [\eqref=3.8].

Note: [formula], so [formula] is unitary.

Let C be the CMV matrix, C({αn(dμ)}∞n = 0), of dμ. Given n and β, pick x so [formula] is rank one, and let [formula] be the matrix obtained from C by replacing Θ(αn - 1) by [formula]. Then [formula] is unitary (by the note after Lemma [\ref=L3.3]) and C  -   is rank one. Thus, by Theorem [\ref=T2.3], [formula] has at most one eigenvalue in (w0,w1). But [formula] is a direct sum of [formula] and another matrix, so Cn has at most one eigenvalue in (w0,w1). By Proposition [\ref=P3.2], zeros of n are eigenvalues of Cn.

Let [formula]. By Theorem 5.2 of [\cite=Evansproc] (see also [\cite=OPUC1]), Cn({  -  α̃m}n - 1m = 0) is unitarily equivalent to [formula] where [formula] differs from M by having [formula] in place of [formula]. Thus, Cn({αm}n - 1m = 0) -  is rank one, and Theorem [\ref=T1.2] follows from Propositions [\ref=P2.4] and [\ref=P3.1].

If then C({αm}n - 1m = 0) - C({α'm}n - 1m = 0) is obviously rank one. Moreover, δn - 1 is a cyclic vector since Cn run backwards is essentially another Cn (with the initial [formula] replaced by [formula]) or Ctn. Thus, Theorem [\ref=T1.3] follows from Proposition [\ref=P2.4].

Let Cn + 1 (resp. Cn) be the (n + 1)  ×  (n + 1) (resp. n  ×  n) finite CMV matrix whose characteristic polynomial is n + 1 (resp. n). By Lemma [\ref=L3.3], a rank one perturbation turns Cn + 1 into [formula] where λn is given by [\eqref=1.7]. The vector in the perturbation is aδn - 1  +  bδn, so Proposition [\ref=P2.6] applies and proves Theorem [\ref=T1.4].

As a final result:

Let m > n. Then strictly between any pair of zeros of n is a zero of m.

Let Cn,Cm be as in the last proof. By a rank one perturbation, Cm can be changed to [formula]. Now apply Proposition [\ref=P2.6].
