Abstract

We find relations between quantities defining geometry and quantities defining the length of a curve in geometries underlying Electromagnetism and unified model of Electromagnetism and Gravitation. We show that the length of a vector changes along a curve in these geometries.

Introduction

In paper [\cite=sh1] a new geometry called General Geometry is formulated and it is shown that its the most simplest case is geometry underlying electromagnetism. However, relation between quantities defining geometry [formula] and the length of a curve Aμ was assumed. Next, in paper [\cite=sh2] it is shown that geometry underlying unified model of electromagnetism and gravitation is also a special case of General Geometry. There, relations between quantities defining geometry [formula], [formula] and the length of a curve gμν, Aμ were also assumed.

In the present paper, it is shown that relations assumed in [\cite=sh1] and [\cite=sh2] hold to be true provided that the length of a vector changes along a curve in both geometries.

In Riemannian geometry the length of a vector does not change and this makes it be an underlying geometry for Gravitation. If the length of a vector changes in Riemannian geometry then it fails to be an underlying geometry for Gravitation. This failure has been demonstrated by H. Weyl [\cite=w] who investigated Riemannian geometry with changing length of a vector in an attempt to unify electromagnetism and gravitation (for discussion see [\cite=p]). However, we show that the length of a vector changes along a curve in the presence of electromagnetic field in a geometry completely different from Riemannian one.

In summary, Geometry of Electromagnetism [\cite=sh1] with changing length of a vector has physical interpretation as geometry underlying Electromagnetism. Riemannian geometry with constant length of a vector has physical interpretation as geometry underlying Gravitation. Combination of Geometry of Electromagnetism and Riemannian geometry with changing length of a vector is geometry underlying unified model of Electromagnetism and Gravitation.

In the next section we prove relations assumed in [\cite=sh1] and [\cite=sh2] and show that the length of a vector changes along a curve in these geometries.

On Special Cases of General Geometry

We recall that Geometry of Electromagnetism [\cite=sh1] is defined by

[formula]

We consider the following metric

[formula]

Accordingly, the length of a vector [formula] is

[formula]

And we assume that

[formula]

where Aμ are some functions of x , Φν are functions of Aμ and Fμν, and q, c, m are some parameters. Equation ([\ref=g]) means that the length of a vector changes along a curve due to Φν. Substitution of dl in ([\ref=g]) by ([\ref=geN]) leads to equations

[formula]

The most general solution to the first one is any antisymmetric tensor

[formula]

We choose Φν such that the second equation has solution

[formula]

As it is shown in [\cite=sh1], curvature vector Rλ is equal to Rλ  =  ∂μFμλ. Equation Rλ = 0 coincides with Maxwell equation for electromagnetic field Aμ and equation for geodesics coincides with the equation for a particle interacting with electromagnetic field Aμ. This allows us to interpret Aμ as electromagnetic field and geometry defined by ([\ref=ge]) with ([\ref=ge1]) and ([\ref=g]) as geometry underlying electromagnetism. q is identified with charge, m with mass of a particle interacting with electromagnetic field Aμ, c is the speed of the light.

If we choose Φν = 0 then the second equation in ([\ref=2e]) reduces to

[formula]

Multiplication by Aσ gives

[formula]

This equation is a constraint for Aμ. Therefore in order to consider general functions Aμ of x we have to allow Φν  ≠  0. Hence, the length of a vector must change along a curve in Geometry of Electromagnetism.

Next we consider geometry underlying unified model of electromagnetism and gravitation [\cite=sh2] defined by

[formula]

and choose metric as

[formula]

where gμν(x) is a metric tensor and the length of a vector V is

[formula]

and it changes as

[formula]

Note that in this geometry ξρ = gρμξμ. Substitution of dl in ([\ref=2]) by ([\ref=1]) gives rise to

[formula]

Solutions to the first equation are

[formula]

We choose [formula] so that the second equation solves as

[formula]

According to the results obtained in [\cite=sh2] we interpret gμν as gravitational field and Aμ as electromagnetic field.

Conclusion

In this paper we considered only two special cases of General Geometry [\cite=sh1]. Resuming, geometries discussed in this paper, with appropriate metrics are underlying geometries for physical theories. The most simplest case of General Geometry

[formula]

with metric

[formula]

is geometry underlying Electromagnetism. Next order in xu, Riemannian geometry,

[formula]

with metric

[formula]

is geometry underlying Gravitation. Combination of two previous geometries

[formula]

with metric

[formula]

is geometry underlying unified model of Electromagnetism and Gravitation [\cite=sh2].

We do not discuss the other special cases in this paper. Riemannian Geometry with metric [formula] without parameters instead of ([\ref=*]) has been considered in [\cite=r] and applied to Kaluza-Klein theory. As we demonstrated in [\cite=sh1] any attempt to geometrize electromagnetism in geometries like Riemannian, (for example in the so called Finsler geometry) independent of the chosen metric must fail [\cite=bail]. By choosing different metrics we do not change geometry [\cite=r], [\cite=ssc], {[\cite=cFinsler].
