Fillings, finite generation and direct limits of relatively hyperbolic groups

Introduction

This paper is about the relationship between finitely generated and infinitely generated relatively hyperbolic groups. Most definitions and characterizations of relatively hyperbolic groups [\cite=gromov] [\cite=farb] [\cite=bowditch] [\cite=yaman] [\cite=drutusapir] assume finite generation at the outset. One exception is that of Osin [\cite=Osin-book]. In this definition, a group, finitely presented relative to a system of subgroups, is hyperbolic relative to that system if and only if the relative isoperimetric function is linear. (See Section [\ref=core] for definitions.)

Of interest to conjectures such as the Baum-Connes Conjecture and the Novikov Conjecture are 'exotic' groups, which may be used to test these conjectures. One way to build such exotic groups is by taking direct limits of hyperbolic groups, a method brought to great prominence by Olshanskii (see, for example, [\cite=Olsh]). However, hyperbolic groups are known to satisfy the Baum-Connes Conjecture (this is due to Mineyev and Yu [\cite=MY]), and the rational injectivity of the Baum-Connes assembly map is preserved by direct limits. This implies the Novikov Conjecture for groups built as direct limits of hyperbolic groups.

There are by now many results of the form: Suppose that [formula] is a property which implies the Novikov conjecture (or the Strong Novikov Conjecture, or the Baum-Connes Conjecture), and suppose that G is a (finitely generated) group which is hyperbolic relative to groups satisfying [formula]. Then G satisfies [formula]. (See, for example, [\cite=Osin-FAD], [\cite=DG-ueRH], [\cite=Ozawa]).

It appears then that finitely generated relatively hyperbolic groups are not a reasonable place to search for counterexamples to these conjectures, for likely one would have to build the pathology into the parabolic subgroups, and relative hyperbolicity would be irrelevant. In [\cite=Osin-small], Osin constructs groups with some remarkable properties as direct limits of infinitely generated relatively hyperbolic groups. One might think that these more flexible constructions might be of some help in building counterexamples to the Strong Novikov Conjecture. The main result of this paper (see Theorem [\ref=Novikov]) shows that this is probably not the case: Behavior exotic enough to defy the Strong Novikov Conjecture would have to be built into the finitely generated subgroups of the parabolic subgroups.

An outline of this paper is as follows: In Section [\ref=core] we introduce the notion of the finitely generated core of a relatively hyperbolic group (this concept is implicit in [\cite=Osin-book]). In Section [\ref=fillcore] we explain how the main result in Osin's paper [\cite=Osin-fill] about Dehn filling in relatively hyperbolic groups follows from the version where the relatively hyperbolic groups are assumed to be finitely generated. (In [\cite=GM] the authors proved this finitely generated version under the additional assumption that the group is torsion-free.) In Section [\ref=indlim] we record some simple observations about direct limits of relatively hyperbolic groups. In particular, a direct limit of relatively hyperbolic groups is in fact the direct limit of finitely generated relatively hyperbolic groups. In Section [\ref=s:Novikov] we use the main result of Section [\ref=indlim] (along with known results about uniform embeddability and the Strong Novikov Conjecture) to deduce the main result of this paper: that many of the remarkable groups constructed in [\cite=Osin-small] satisfy the Strong Novikov Conjecture (see Theorem [\ref=Novikov]).

The finitely generated core

Everything in this section is also contained in [\cite=Osin-book]; only the term finitely generated core is new.

Suppose that G is a group with a family of subgroups {Hλ}λ∈Λ, so that G has a finite relative presentation

[formula]

where S is the finite relative generating set, and

[formula]

is a finite set of defining relations. Here [formula] denotes the free group on the letters S. We briefly recall the meaning of [\eqref=relpres] from [\cite=Osin-book]. Let [formula] be the disjoint union of the subgroups {Hλ}. For each λ, let [formula] be the collection of words in the alphabet Hλ which represent the identity in Hλ. The relative presentation [\eqref=relpres] is shorthand for the (non-relative) presentation

[formula]

where [formula]. If D is a van Kampen diagram over the presentation [\eqref=nonrelpres], then it has a relative area which is the number of 2-cells in the diagram labelled by elements of [formula]. Let w be a word in the alphabet [formula] which represents the identity in G. The relative area of w is the smallest relative area of any van Kampen diagram over [\eqref=nonrelpres] whose boundary is labelled by w.

A group with finite relative presentation [formula] is hyperbolic relative to the collection of subgroups {Hλ}λ∈Λ if the relative isoperimetric function is linear, in the following sense: There is a constant C so that every word w in the alphabet [formula] which represents the identity in G can be filled by a van Kampen diagram of relative area at most Cn.

Given a relative presentation as in [\eqref=relpres], each [formula] can be written in normal form as some product

[formula]

with each wi a word in the free group [formula] and each hi in Hλi for some λi∈Λ. Let Ω be the set of nontrivial elements of [formula] which occur in one of these normal forms. Since Ω is finite, the set [formula] is also finite. For each i∈I, [formula] (finitely) generates some Hi' < Hi. Let G' be the subgroup of G generated by [formula]. We call G' the finitely generated core of G associated to the presentation [formula]. (The finitely generated core is highly non-unique; see Remark [\ref=AddFiniteSet].) The next three lemmas are contained in the statement and proof of Theorem 2.44 in [\cite=Osin-book] (In Osin's statement, the finitely generated core is called Q.). The second is straightforward; the first and third can be proved using simple variations on the arguments in Section [\ref=fillcore].

If G' is the finitely generated core of G coming from the finite relative presentation [formula], then G' has a finite relative presentation

[formula]

(Note that

[formula]

so the presentation in [\eqref=corepres] is at least well defined.)

If G is given by the finite relative presentation [formula], and [formula] is the corresponding finitely generated core of G, as in the first paragraph, then

[formula]

where G0 is the subgroup of G generated by [formula].

[formula] is hyperbolic relative to {Hλ}λ∈Λ if and only if its finitely generated core G' is hyperbolic relative to {Hi'}i∈I.

If G has a finite relative presentation

[formula]

and T  ⊆  G is finite, then there is obviously a finite relative presentation

[formula]

for some (finite) set of relators [formula] containing [formula]. Thus given the finite set T  ⊆  G, there is always a finitely generated core containing T. This observation will be used in Section [\ref=indlim].

Fillings and cores

In [\cite=Osin-fill], Osin proved the following theorem:

[\cite=Osin-fill] Suppose that G is hyperbolic relative to the system of subgroups {Hλ}λ∈Λ. Then there is a finite set [formula] so that if {Kλ}λ∈Λ is a collection of subgroups so that for each λ∈Λ, we have

[formula], and

[formula],

then

The natural map [formula] is an injection, and

[formula] is hyperbolic relative to {φλ(Hλ / Kλ)}λ∈Λ.

In [\cite=GM], we proved the same theorem, with the additional assumptions that G is torsion-free and that the (finitely many) parabolic subgroups are finitely generated.

The torsion-free assumption in [\cite=GM] is technical, and will not be addressed here. However, we remarked in [\cite=GM] that if one can prove Theorem [\ref=infinite] under the additional assumptions that Λ is finite and each Hλ is finitely generated, then the full statement follows. This is the content of this section.

If Theorem [\ref=infinite] holds with the additional hypotheses that Λ is finite and that Hλ is finitely generated for each λ∈Λ, then Theorem [\ref=infinite] holds in full generality.

Let [formula] and G' the finitely generated core of G relative to [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=l:corepres], [formula] is a relative presentation for G'. Lemma [\ref=l:freeproduct] implies that G splits as a free product

[formula]

where G0 is the subgroup of G generated by [formula]. Arbitrarily filling peripheral subgroups Hλ for λ∉I does not affect the free product structure of G (or relative hyperbolicity). We may therefore assume that Λ = I, and so G = G0.

Lemma [\ref=l:corerh] implies that G' is hyperbolic relative to {Hi'}i∈I, so we may apply the finitely generated version of Theorem [\ref=infinite] to G'. Let B be the finite subset of [formula] of "forbidden" elements for peripheral fillings of G' coming from Theorem [\ref=infinite] in the finitely generated case. We show that B also suffices as the set of forbidden elements for G.

For each i∈I, let [formula] satisfy [formula]. The following is obvious:

If [formula], then [formula] and [formula].

Let N be the normal closure of [formula] in G, and let N' be the normal closure of [formula] in G'. Write [formula] for the image of Hi under the quotient map G  →  G / N, and write [formula] for the image of Hi' under the quotient map G'  →  G' / N'. Theorem [\ref=infinite] in the finitely generated case and Claim [\ref=claim:normal] together imply that G' / N' is hyperbolic relative to [formula].

We will show that G' / N' is a finitely generated core of G / N; Lemma [\ref=l:corerh] and Claim [\ref=injects] (below) then imply the proposition.

We introduce some notation in this paragraph. Let [formula] be the disjoint union of the Hi for i∈I and let [formula] be the collection of words representing the identity in some Hi. Finally, let [formula] be the disjoint union of the Ki for i∈I. The quotient group G / N has the presentation

[formula]

which can also be written as the relative presentation

[formula]

Let [formula] be a word which is trivial in G / N. There is a van Kampen diagram over [\eqref=quotientpres] for w containing five possible kinds of two-cells:

[formula]-cells,

H'-cells: cells representing relations in Hi' for some i∈I,

K'-cells: cells representing elements of Ki' < G for some i∈I,

[formula]-cells: cells representing relations in Hi for some i∈I which involve some elements of [formula], and

[formula]-cells: cells representing elements of [formula] for some i∈I.

The first three kinds of 2-cells will be called good, the last two bad. A bad patch P is a maximal union of bad 2-cells, subject to the condition that the interior of P is connected.

Each edge of the van Kampen diagram is labelled by some element of [formula]. Edges of the van Kampen diagram will be called good if they are labelled by elements of [formula]; otherwise they are bad. Every bad 2-cell has at least one bad edge in its boundary, whereas good 2-cells have no bad edges in their boundary.

The point of the good/bad notation is that if we can modify a van Kampen diagram so that it contains only good 2-cells, then it follows that its boundary represents the trivial element of G' / N'.

For each i∈I, the natural map from Hi' / Ki' to G / N is injective.

Let w∈Hi' be in the kernel of the map to G / N, and let D be a van Kampen diagram for w as described above. (In particular ∂D consists of a single good edge.) If this van Kampen diagram can be modified to contain only good 2-cells, then w is in the kernel of the natural map from Hi' to G' / N', and thus by the finitely generated version of Theorem [\ref=infinite] we have w∈Ki'.

Let P be any bad patch. Note that all the 2-cells in P have boundary labels in a single subgroup Hj, for some j∈I which may be different from i.

If not, then there is some bad edge in ∂P. This edge can only be adjacent to another bad 2-cell (in which case P is not maximal) or to the boundary of the van Kampen diagram itself. Since the boundary of the van Kampen diagram is labelled only by good edges, we derive a contradiction.

We now suppose P is a bad patch which is innermost in the following sense: No other bad patch is separated from the boundary of the van Kampen diagram by the interior of P. It is evident that if there are any bad patches, then at least one is innermost. Let cP be the outermost boundary of P.

We claim that the sub-diagram bounded by cP can be modified so that every 2-cell has all its boundary labels in Hj. If P is simply connected, this is immediate. Suppose then that the innermost bad patch P is not simply connected. Some component c of ∂P bounds a disk D containing only good 2-cells, since P is innermost. Moreover, c consists only of good edges. Reading the labels of the edges of c gives some word wc in the alphabet [formula], and the disk D is itself a van Kampen diagram for wc in G' / N'. By Subclaim [\ref=sc], wc represents some element of Hj' < G'. The disk D is a demonstration that it represents the trivial element of G' / N'. Since Hj' / Nj' injects into G' / N' by assumption, it follows that wc represents an element of N'. The disk D may therefore be replaced by a single K'-cell. Applying this argument in turn to each inner boundary component of P, we fill cP entirely by 2-cells with boundary labels in Hj.

Let wP be the word in [formula] given by the labels of cP. By the previous paragraph, wP represents the trivial element of Hj / Kj. Moreover, by Subclaim [\ref=sc], it lies in Hj'. Since Hj' / Kj' injects into Hj / Kj, wP represents an element of Kj'. We therefore can replace the bad patch P (and any disks attached to its interior) with a single K'-cell, thus reducing the number of bad cells in the van Kampen diagram. Iterating this procedure, all bad cells can be removed, and Claim [\ref=primeinjects] follows.

For each i∈I, the natural map from Hi / Ki to G / N is injective.

We now assume that [formula] and suppose that w lies in N. Again we can build a van Kampen diagram D for w, this time with boundary equal to a single bad edge. We argue as in Claim [\ref=primeinjects]: First, there is a single outermost bad patch (since ∂D is a a single bad edge), and the boundary of each other bad patch is an element of some Hj'. We now reduce the number of bad patches until D contains a single bad patch and no [formula]-cells. It follows that w is already trivial in Hi / Ki, and Claim [\ref=injects] is proved.

We now turn to the proof of Proposition [\ref=finitetoinfinite]. By Claim [\ref=injects], we can regard each Hi / Ki as a subgroup of G / N. The subgroup N of G is the normal closure of the set [formula], so we obtain a finite relative presentation

[formula]

where [formula] is the image of [formula] in [formula] under the obvious map from [formula]. It remains to observe that (regarding Hi' / Ki' as a subgroup of Hi / Ki) the group G' / N' is the finitely generated core coming from the presentation [\eqref=quotient],

[formula]

This completes the proof of Proposition [\ref=finitetoinfinite].

Direct limits of relatively hyperbolic groups

Direct limits of groups are a particularly good way of building finitely generated groups with interesting properties. This idea was developed by Olshanskii [\cite=Olsh] with direct limits of hyperbolic groups, and recently by Osin [\cite=Osin-small] for direct limits of relatively hyperbolic groups. We are interested in the relatively hyperbolic construction.

Suppose that [formula] is a sequence of groups, and {φi:Gi  →  Gi + 1} is a sequence of homomorphisms.

Let [formula] be the Cartesian product of the Gi. Define a subset Λ  ⊂  X as follows:

[formula]

Put an equivalence relation '~  ' on Λ so that (gi)  =  (hi) if there is some K so that for all k  ≥  K we have gk  =  hk.

Let L  =  Λ  /    ~  . The group operation on X descends to L, and L is a group, called the direct limit of {(Gi,φi)}.

Using the definition above, if the groups Gi are countable then so is the limit L. If one were to allow more general directed systems then this would no longer be the case. However, in order to understand the constructions from [\cite=Osin-small], the above definition is sufficient.

We will need the following lemma.

Suppose that G is a countable relatively hyperbolic group. Then the collection of (nontrivial) parabolic subgroups of G is countable.

Let Λ be the index set for the parabolic subgroups {Hλ}λ∈Λ of G. We suppose that each Hλ is nontrivial. We have to show that Λ is countable.

Let G' be a finitely generated core of G, and suppose that G' is hyperbolic relative to {Hi'}i∈I.

By Lemma [\ref=l:freeproduct] we have

[formula]

where G0 is hyperbolic relative to {Hi}i∈I. A countable group cannot contain uncountably many nontrivial free factors, so [formula] is countable, which implies that Λ is countable, as required.

Suppose that G is a group which is isomorphic to a direct limit of groups [formula] so that each Gi is countable and hyperbolic relative to some collection of proper subgroups [formula]. Then for every i, there exists a finite relative presentation Presi of Gi with respect to [formula] and homomorphisms φi:Gi'  →  Gi + 1' such that G is isomorphic to the direct limit of finitely generated groups [formula], where Gi' is the finitely generated core of Gi associated to Presi for each i.

Suppose that G is the direct limit of {(Gi,φi)} where φi:Gi  →  Gi + 1, and the Gi are all relatively hyperbolic.

Let [formula] be the parabolic subgroups of Gi, and Xi a finite relative generating set for Gi with respect to [formula].

The group G is countable, so let [formula] be an enumeration of its elements. For each i  ≥  0, let j(i) be the least number so that (i) j(i)  ≥  j(i - 1)  +  1; and (ii) the image of Gj(i) in G contains [formula]. Since we may pass to a subsequence without changing the limit, for ease of notation we will suppose that j(i)  =  i.

Let [formula] be a subset of Gi so that the map from Gi to G sends gil to gl.

We will define a collection of finitely generated subgroups Gi' of Gi, and homomorphisms φi':Gi'  →  Gi + 1' so that (i) the direct limit of {(Gi',φi')} is G; and (ii) each Gi' is relatively hyperbolic. In fact, the map φi' will be the restriction of φi to Gi', and we will use the notation φi for this map also.

Define G0' to be the finitely generated core of G0 with respect to a finite relative presentation with the relative generating set [formula].

Suppose that, for r  <  i, we have defined Gr' (with finite relative generating set Zr, and finitely many finitely generated parabolics) and φr - 1'. We define Gi' as follows:

Let Wi  =  φi - 1(Zi - 1)∈Gi, and let [formula]. The set Zi is a finite relative generating set for Gi, so there is some finite relative presentation [formula]. Define Gi' to be the finitely generated core of Gi associated to Presi.

By Lemma [\ref=l:corerh], the group Gi' is hyperbolic relative to its finitely many nontrivial intersections with the elements of [formula], and these intersections are themselves finitely generated.

We claim that the direct limit of {(Gi',φi)} is isomorphic to G. Let L be the direct limit of {(Gi',φi)}. Since each Gi' is a subgroup of Gi, and the map [formula] is a restriction of the homomorphism [formula], there is an obvious map π:L  →  G. We construct the inverse map [formula] as follows: suppose that g∈G. Then there is some i so that g  =  gi. Then the choice of j(i) (and the renumbering above) implies that for all j  ≥  i there is an element gji∈Gj so that gji maps to g under the canonical map from Gj to G. But then gji∈Gj' and φj(gji)  =  gj + 1i. We set π- 1(g) to be the sequence [formula], where the first i - 1 terms of this sequence are the identity element. It is clear that π- 1 is the inverse of π, and we have proved the proposition.

Some examples of Osin and the (Strong) Novikov conjecture

In [\cite=Osin-small], Osin gives constructions of groups satisfying some remarkable properties. We show that if the input to these constructions is a uniformly embeddable group then the Strong Novikov Conjecture holds for the output. In particular were these constructions to yield a counterexample to the Strong Novikov Conjecture, then the input group must already have been rather exotic.

Uniform embeddability for groups was introduced by Gromov in [\cite=Gromov-AsymInv]. However, it is now more common to use the following more general notion:

Let (X,d1) and (Y,d2) be metric spaces. A map i:X  →  Y is a uniform embedding if there are unbounded increasing functions [formula] so that for all x,x'∈X,

[formula]

A countable group G is called uniformly embeddable if there is a uniform embedding of G into a Hilbert space.

In the terminology of Roe [\cite=RoeBook], a group is uniformly embeddable if it admits a coarse embedding into Hilbert space. The connection between uniform embeddability and the Novikov Conjecture was established in [\cite=Yu], where the Novikov Conjecture was proved for a uniformly embeddable group whose classifying space has the homotopy type of a finite CW complex. The finiteness assumption is removed in [\cite=STY], where the Strong Novikov Conjecture is established for all uniformly embeddable groups.

In the statement below, π(K) is the set of (finite) orders of elements of a group K. A group G is said to be verbally complete if the equation [formula] has a solution in G, for any g∈G, and for w any (freely reduced, nonempty) word in any number of free variables. (In particular, every element of such a group is a commutator, has roots of all orders, and so on.)

Given any uniformly embeddable countable group G, there exist 2-generated groups H1 and H2 satisfying:

G embeds in H1 and in H2.

H1 and H2 satisfy the Strong Novikov Conjecture.

π(H1) = π(G) and any two elements of H1 with the same order are conjugate.

H2 is verbally complete; moreover, if G is torsion-free, then so is H2.

Before giving the proof of Theorem [\ref=Novikov], we should remark that the construction (and most of the theorem) is due to Denis Osin in [\cite=Osin-small]; the sole innovation here is that point [\eqref=Nov] can be guaranteed.

If we start with an infinite torsion-free uniformly embeddable group (like [formula]), then Theorem [\ref=Novikov] yields:

There exists a 2-generated, infinite, torsion-free group G which has two conjugacy classes and satisfies the Strong Novikov Conjecture.

There exists a 2-generated, infinite, torsion-free group G which is verbally complete and satisfies the Strong Novikov Conjecture.

The following proposition is used in the proof of Theorem [\ref=Novikov].

If G is a uniformly embeddable group then G can be embedded into countable groups R1 and R2 so that:

Finitely generated subgroups of R1 and R2 are uniformly embeddable.

π(R1) = π(G) and all elements of the same order are conjugate.

R2 is verbally complete.

For R1 satisfying [\eqref=orders], we use a construction of Higman, Neumann, and Neumann [\cite=HNN] (see Lyndon and Schupp [\cite=LyndonSchupp]). Let G0 = G. Suppose Gi - 1 has been defined, and let [formula] be the set of pairs of elements in Gi - 1 so that the orders of αj and βj are equal. Define Gi by the presentation:

[formula]

and define [formula] to be the direct limit of these groups.

For R2 satisfying [\eqref=verb], we refer to the construction in [\cite=Osin-small]. We will use only the following facts:

The group R2 is also a union of subgroups Ui for [formula], and U0 = G.

If i  ≥  1, then Ui + 1 is an amalgamated free product of Ui with infinitely many groups [formula], where each Fij is either a free group or a one-relator group with torsion, and each amalgamating subgroup is cyclic.

It remains only to prove that finitely generated subgroups of R1 and R2 are uniformly embeddable. We prove both simultaneously. Let H be a finitely generated subgroup of R1 or R2. If H < R1, then we will set Vi = Gi for each i; if H < R2, we set Vi = Ui. The group H is contained in Vi for some [formula]. If i = 0, we are done, since subgroups of uniformly embeddable groups are clearly uniformly embeddable. We may suppose by induction that finitely generated subgroups of Vi - 1 are uniformly embeddable. Free groups and one relator groups with torsion are word hyperbolic ([\cite=Newman]; see [\cite=LyndonSchupp]); their finitely generated subgroups therefore have finite asymptotic dimension (this is a result of Gromov; see [\cite=Roe-hypFAD]), and are therefore uniformly embeddable (see [\cite=RoeBook]). Thus Vi is a graph of groups with cyclic edge groups and uniformly embeddable vertex groups. The group H inherits a graph of groups decomposition from Vi; the edge groups are again cyclic. Since H is finitely generated, the graph of groups decomposition of H has a finite underlying graph. Also, since H is finitely generated and the edge groups of the (finite) graph of groups are finitely generated, the vertex groups of the graph of groups are finitely generated. Thus by induction the vertex groups are uniformly embeddable. Now we may apply a theorem of Dadarlat and Guentner [\cite=DG-ue] to to deduce that H is uniformly embeddable.

Note that the proposition implies that R1 and R2 are uniformly embeddable, since countable locally uniformly embeddable groups are uniformly embeddable by [\cite=DG-ue].

The hypothesis and conclusion of uniform embeddability in Proposition [\ref=prop:fad] may be strengthened to finite asymptotic dimension, by applying theorems of Osin [\cite=Osin-FAD] and Bell and Dranishnikov [\cite=BellDranisnikovTrees] in place of the theorems of Dadarlat and Guentner quoted above.

(Theorem [\ref=Novikov]) We do not describe Osin's constructions here, but refer the reader to [\cite=Osin-small], particularly to the overview in Section 2 of his paper.

The groups H1 and H2 are built as direct limits of (infinitely generated) relatively hyperbolic groups, with peripheral subgroup R1 or R2, respectively. At each stage the term in the direct limit is hyperbolic relative to R1 or R2 from the above proposition. The finitely generated cores of these terms are therefore hyperbolic relative to finitely generated subgroups of R1 or R2; these finitely generated subgroups are uniformly embeddable by Proposition [\ref=prop:fad]. The cores are thus hyperbolic relative to uniformly embeddable subgroups; by the main result of [\cite=DG-ueRH] they are themselves uniformly embeddable. Thus, if Γ is such a finitely generated core, then by [\cite=STY], the Baum-Connes assembly map with coefficients is injective (with any separable Γ-[formula]-algebra coefficients). In particular, the Baum-Connes assembly map (with trivial coefficients) is injective for each such Γ, i.e. the finitely generated core Γ satisfies the Strong Novikov Conjecture.

We have exhibited H1 and H2 as direct limits of groups satisfying the Strong Novikov Conjecture. By [\cite=Rosenberg], the Strong Novikov Conjecture is stable under taking direct limits, so H1 and H2 themselves satisfy the Strong Novikov Conjecture.

By the main result of [\cite=DG-ue], the class of countable groups which are uniformly embeddable is closed under direct limits of groups (where all of the maps are injective). It is clear from Lemma [\ref=l:corerh] and Remark [\ref=AddFiniteSet] that if G is a countable relatively hyperbolic group with parabolic subgroups {Hi}i∈I then G is the direct limit of an increasing collection of finitely generated cores of G, each of which is hyperbolic relative to a collection of finitely generated subgroups of finitely many of the Hi. Therefore, we have the following generalization of the main result of [\cite=DG-ueRH].

Suppose that G is a (countable but not necessarily finitely generated) group which is hyperbolic relative to a (not necessarily finite) collection of subgroups {Hi}i∈I, and suppose that each of the Hi is uniformly embeddable. Then G is uniformly embeddable.

We feel that it is worth remarking that although Proposition [\ref=prop:limits] proves that in theory Osin could have built his examples without using infinitely generated relatively hyperbolic groups, it is very difficult to see how to do this directly, and in any case infinitely generated relatively hyperbolic groups certainly make the proof conceptually easier.
