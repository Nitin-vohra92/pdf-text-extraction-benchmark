Introduction

The punctual Hilbert schemes HilbdS of length d subschemes of a smooth K3 surface S are examples of smooth complex symplectic varieties [\cite=beau1]. The K3 surfaces are the only smooth compact complex symplectic varieties of dimension two. Any curve C on a K3 surface is automatically a Lagrangian subvariety of S, and if C  ⊂  S is a smooth curve of genus g then the relative Jacobian J is a Lagrangian fibration (equivalently, an algebraically completely integrable system, see [\cite=DM], 2.3) over an open subset of the complete linear system [formula], see [\cite=beau2]. In fact, if all the curves in |C| are reduced, then the compactified relative Jacobian [formula] is a smooth symplectic variety and still remains a Lagrangian fibration, see also § 4 in [\cite=Bot]. Recently Sawon, by using the techniques of the Fourier-Mukai functors, managed to show that for any k  ≥  2, and for the general K3 surface S with primitive polarization of degree d = k2(2g - 2), the Hilbert scheme HilbgS is locally isomorphic to a compactified relative Jacobian [formula] as above, thus proving the existence of a Lagrangian fibration on HilbgS over [formula], see [\cite=Saw]. The fibrations of Beauville and Sawon are fibered generically by Jacobians of curves, and one may ask how to find other types of Lagrangian fibrations.

A way towards new examples is the following criterion of integrability, due to Donagi and Markman and generalizing the above construction of Beauville (see 8.1-8.2 in [\cite=DM]):

(DM) Let M be a smooth complex symplectic variety, and let Z  ⊂  M be a smooth Lagrangian subvariety. Then the relative Picard bundle Pico is a Lagrangian fibration (an algebraically completely integrable system) over an open set of the base of deformations of Z in M.

In general, the criterion (DM) raises the problem of finding examples of complex symplectic varieties M (different from K3 surfaces) and Lagrangian subvarieties Z with well understood Picard variety and deformations in M.

The first higher dimensional symplectic variety that has been exploited in this context is the Beauville-Donagi variety - the Fano fourfold F(W) of lines on the general smooth cubic fourfold W, see [\cite=BD]. This is performed in two different setups, corresponding to two basic families of Lagrangian surfaces in F(W) arising from the geometry of cubic hypersurfaces of dimensions 3 and 5. In the first case, as observed by Voisin, the Fano families of lines on the general cubic threefolds contained in W as hyperplane sections are smooth Lagrangian surfaces in F(W), see Exemple 3 in [\cite=voisin]. Applying (DM), one obtains (see Example 8.22 of [\cite=DM]): The relative intermediate Jacobian over the family of smooth cubic threefolds, contained as hyperplane sections of W, is an algebraic integrable system. In the second case, by our recent observation (see [\cite=IMn2]) the Fano families of planes on the general cubic fivefolds containing W as a hyperplane section are embedded by the intersection map as smooth Lagrangian surfaces in F(W). This yields the second application of (DM), which is in some sense symmetric to the first: The relative intermediate Jacobian over the family of smooth cubic fivefolds, containing W as a hyperplane section, is an algebraic integrable system, ibid.

In the present paper we consider, instead of the Beauville-Donagi variety, the Hilbert powers HilbdS of smooth K3 surfaces S contained in prime Fano threefolds.

Recall that a prime Fano threefold is a smooth compact complex variety X of dimension 3 for which the anticanonical divisor H  =   - KX is the ample generator of Pic(X). For such X, the number g  =   - K3X / 2 + 1 is always a positive integer, called the genus of X  =  X2g - 2. Prime Fano threefolds exist only for [formula] (see [\cite=IP]). A general member of the anticanonical linear system | - KX| of a prime Fano threefold X  =  X2g - 2, is a K3 surface S  =  S2g - 2 of genus g. Mukai proved that the converse is also true: the general K3 surface of genus g, [formula] can be embedded as an anticanonical divisor in a prime Fano threefold of genus g, see [\cite=mukai1] or [\cite=beau3] for a more precise statement. In this situation takes place the following observation, due originally to Thomas (see Theorem 1.6.1 in [\cite=Tho]):

Let S  =  S2g - 2 be a K3 surface in a prime Fano threefold X  =  X2g - 2 of genus g. Then for any integer d  ≥  1, any component H of the Hilbert scheme of smooth curves of degree d on X is sent by the intersection map j with S to a Lagrangian subvariety j(H) of HilbdS,

see Lemma 1. Since our study will require a closer inspection of the intersection map j, in § 2 we write down a detailed proof of Lemma 1. In particular, we state a criterion for j to be an immersion (see Corollary [\ref=criterion]).

In § 3 and § 4.1 we study the scheme F(X) of conics on a prime Fano threefold X  =  X2g - 2. Notice that together with the family of lines, this is one of the two best studied families of curves on prime Fano threefolds; see Ch.4 of [\cite=IP] for a survey of the basic results about lines and conics on Fano threefolds. In § 3.1 we collect the most important, at least from our perspective, of these results, beginning with the fact that for X general, F(X) is a smooth irreducible surface, the Fano surface of X. In § 3.2 we study the intersection map j:F(X)  →  Hilb2S for the general pair (X,S) of a prime Fano threefold X and a K3 surface S∈| - KX|. By Lemma 1, j(F(X)) is a Lagrangian surface in the symplectic fourfold Hilb2S.

In order to apply the integrability criterion (DM), we need to know whether j(F(X)) is smooth. By the Proof of Proposition [\ref=immers], for g  ≥  7 the map j is injective; in particular the isomorphic image j(F(X)) of the smooth Fano surface F(X) is a smooth Lagrangian subvariety of Hilb2S. So for g  ≥  7 we can directly apply the criterion (DM) to get an integrable system. However for g  ≤  6 the image j(F(X)) is not smooth, even for the general X, and the criterion (DM) cannot be directly applied to pairs (Z,M)  =  (j(F(X)),Hilb2S). More concretely, for any g  ≤  6 the map j is almost an isomorphism from F(X) onto its image, except for a finite number of multiple points (presumably simple double points).

Nevertheless, by Proposition [\ref=immers], for the general pair (X,S), of a prime Fano threefold X of any possible genus g and a K3 surface S∈| - KX| the intersection map j:F(X)  →  Hilb2S is in fact an immersion. In this situation, due to results of Ran and Voisin, we still can apply the criterion (DM), by replacing in its conditions the smooth Lagrangian subvariety by a Lagrangian immersion of a smooth variety, see § 4.2. This gives rise from j(F(X))  ⊂  Hilb2S to an algebraic integrable system (i.e. a Lagrangian fibration) - the relative Picard Pico  →  H over the base H of the deformation space of j (with a fixed target), see § 4.2.

It turns out that we can exactly describe the fibers of this Lagrangian fibration. We make this in two steps. In general, the fibers of such a relative Picard are the Picard schemes of certain smooth surfaces Fs, obtained as deformation of a fixed F(X) = Fo. In our particular case, Proposition 9 shows that all these surfaces Fs are in fact Fano surfaces of Fano threefolds Xs containing the K3 surface S, at least in a neighbourhood of F(X). Next, due to a less known but general fact about prime Fano threefolds, the Abel-Jacobi map from the Albanese variety Alb  F(X) of F(X) to the intermediate Jacobian J(X) of X is an isomorphism, at least for the general prime X of any genus g, see Theorem [\ref=AJ]. Now by Theorem [\ref=AJ], and by the fact that the intermediate Jacobians J(Xs) are principally polarized abelian varieties, J(Xs)≃Alb  F(Xs)≃PicoF(Xs). This yields the main result of the paper, Theorem [\ref=main]:

For a general K3 surface S of genus 2  ≤  g  ≤  10, the relative intermediate Jacobian is generically an algebraic integrable system over the family of prime Fano threefolds containing S.

There is a strong analogy with the fact that the relative intermediate Jacobian is generically a completely integrable system over a complete deformation of gauged Calabi-Yau threefolds ([\cite=DM], Theorem 7.7). Here we considered families of log Calabi-Yau varieties with a fixed boundary, that is, families of pairs (X,S) with X a (Fano) threefold and S a divisor such that KX + S = 0 (the gauge disappears). The boundary S is our fixed K3 surface. It would be interesting to extend our main result to more general families of log Calabi-Yau threefolds.

Lagrangian images of families of curves on Fano threefolds

Recall from [\cite=mukai1] and [\cite=beau3] that for any [formula], the general K3 surface S  =  S2g - 2 of genus g can be represented as an anticanonical divisor in a Fano threefold X  =  X2g - 2 of genus g. For g  ≥  3, the anticanonical bundle - KX is very ample, so S is just a hyperplane section in the anticanonical embedding of X.

Let X  =  X2g - 2 be a Fano threefold of genus g, [formula], and let S be a general member of the anticanonical system | - KX|. Let H be an irreducible component of the Hilbert scheme of curves on X, whose general member is a smooth curve of anticanonical degree d, and consider the intersection map

[formula]

Then the image j(H)  ⊂  HilbdS is a Lagrangian subvariety of HilbdS.

Proof. Let the curve C  ⊂  X be a general element of H. Since the anticanonical divisor is base-point free, and S∈| - KX| is also general, the intersection [formula] is a reduced zero-scheme of length d. Consider the differential

[formula]

The Hilbert scheme HilbdS has a symplectic structure

[formula]

defined by the choice of a non zero section [formula].

Denote by jx the skew-symmetric form defined by the composition

[formula]

We shall see first that [formula], i.e. that j(H) is an isotropic subvariety of HilbdS at the point [formula] with respect to the symplectic structure on HilbdS. For this, consider the diagram

[formula]

The vertical sequence gives a natural isomorphism KX(S)|S = KS (residue). The horizontal sequence gives [formula] So σ lifts uniquely to a section of KX(S), a meromorphic 3-form on X with poles on S. By restriction to C, we get a section σ̃ of [formula]. Let α,β be global sections of NC / X. Then [formula] is a global section of det NC / X, and its product with σ̃ gives a section [formula] of [formula], a meromorphic form on C with poles at [formula]. Now, for any x∈S the following identity takes place

(*) [formula]

To verify (*), choose local coordinates u,v,w on X around x, such that u,v are local equations of C and w a local equation of S. Our generator σ of KS can be written locally as [formula] for f some regular function on S, and it is the residue of the form σ̃ on X which is given locally by

[formula]

Since ∂  /  ∂u and ∂  /  ∂v are local generators of NC / X, we write locally [formula] as [formula]. The result of the contraction with the restriction of σ̃ to C is [formula], whose residue at x is [formula]. On the other hand, jx(α,β) is obtained by evaluating σx on [formula] considered as a vector of [formula]. This gives jx(α,β) = f(x)a(x), as claimed.

Next, by (*) and the residue theorem,

[formula]

which proves that j(H) is an isotropic subvariety of HilbdS at [formula].

Since x1  +    ·   + xd as above is a general point of j(H), then j(H) is an isotropic subvariety of HilbdS; and in order to prove that j(H) is a Lagrangian subvariety of HilbdS it remains to see that j(H) has dimension d.

For this, consider the differential of j at a general member C of the family H.

Let IC and N  =  NC / X denote the ideal sheaf and the normal sheaf of C in X. Since the general C∈H is smooth, in particular C is a locally complete intersection in X, then NC / X is locally free. Let

[formula]

be the natural map deduced from the identity [formula] for the ideal sheaf of [formula] in S, and let

[formula]

be the map deduced from the restriction [formula]. Since this restriction map is surjective, θ is injective. Moreover, the composition

[formula]

is just the evaluation map [formula] on the punctual scheme [formula]. In particular, the kernel of [formula] coincides with the kernel of [formula], which can easily be computed from the exact sequence [formula], twisted by the locally free sheaf N. We get

[formula]

This implies that the relative dimension of j is h1(N). Then, if g denotes the arithmetic genus of C, the Riemann-Roch yields

[formula]

This concludes the proof. [formula]

Example. Let X be a prime Fano threefold of genus g  ≥  3. Then - KX is very ample and defines an embedding [formula]. Consider the family Hcan of canonical curves on X, that is, codimension two linear sections of X. Then dim Hcan  =   dim G(2,g + 2)  =  2g, while these curves have anticanonical degree - K3X = 2g - 2  <   dim Hcan. The image of the map

[formula]

is the family of canonical punctual schemes on S, defined again by codimension two linear sections of S. Its dimension is dim j(Hcan) =  dim G(2,g + 1)  =  2g - 2, as expected, and j is a [formula]-fibration. Note that a canonical curve C has normal bundle [formula], so clearly h1(N) = 2. The fact that j(Hcan) is Lagrangian already appears in [\cite=voisin], Exemple 3.

The proof of the previous statement also provides a criterion for the map j to be immersive.

In the next section this criterion will be applied to conics on prime Fano threefolds.

Fano surfaces of conics on prime Fano threefolds

Let X be a prime Fano threefold of genus g. It is well known that X contains lines, but there is only a one dimensional family of lines on X, and in particular X is not covered by lines, see § 4.2 in [\cite=IP]. But X is covered by conics, and the Fano scheme F(X) of conics on X appears as a fundamental object of study, ibid.

In this section we focus on F(X), for X a general prime Fano threefold, and we apply to conics the main result of the previous section.

Conics on general prime Fano threefolds

First recall that the genus g of a smooth prime Fano threefold X can be any integer between 2 and 12, except 11, see [\cite=IP].

For g = 2, the anticanonical divisor is base point free and defines X as a double cover of [formula] ramified along a general sextic hypersurface (a sextic double solid). For g  ≥  3, - KX is base point free, see Theorem 2.4.5 in [\cite=IP]. Moreover - KX is very ample, with only one exception: the double quadrics X4' for which g  =  3 and - KX defines a double covering from X to the smooth quadric threefold, see Proposition 4.1.11 in [\cite=IP]. Notice that X4' is not the general prime Fano threefold of genus g  =  3, regarded in the context of our main Theorem [\ref=main].

In all the other cases the smooth X  =  X2g - 2 are complete intersections in homogeneous spaces, as follows from the works of Mukai (see [\cite=mukai1], and also [\cite=IP]). For the convenience of the reader we recall below, for each value of g  ≥  3, the nature of Σ, its dimension d, and the multidegree δ of X in Σ.

[formula]

Here G(r,d) (resp. OG(r,d), LG(r,d)) is the Grassmannian of r-dimensional subspaces (resp. isotropic subspaces) of a d-dimensional vector space (resp. endowed with a non degenerate symmetric of skew-symmetric bilinear form, where we consider only one connected component in the case of OG(r,2r)). Gad2 denotes the adjoint variety of the exceptional group G2, the closed G2-orbit in the projectivized Lie algebra [formula].

For any [formula] the Fano scheme of conics F(X) is known to be a smooth surface, and the normal bundle to a general conic q  ⊂  X is trivial, see [\cite=CV] for g  =  2, [\cite=CMW] for g  =  3, [\cite=IMn2] for g  =  4, and Proposition 4.2.5 in [\cite=IP] for g  ≥  5.

For g  =  12, the Fano surface [formula], see Remark 5.2.15 in [\cite=IP].

For g  =  10, F(X) is an Abelian surface. Since we could not find any reference for this fact, we include a proof of the following statement:

For X a general Fano threefold of genus 10, the Fano surface F(X) and the intermediate Jacobian J(X) are isomorphic.

Proof. We first prove that F(X) is an Abelian surface. The idea to prove this is to construct an Abelian fibration on the Hilbert square of a general K3 surface S of genus 10. The existence of this Abelian fibration is known by [\cite=HT] (see also [\cite=Saw] for a more general treatment of Abelian fibrations on Hilbert powers of K3 surfaces).

The general such S is a hyperplane section of the general Fano threefold X of genus 10. Following Mukai, [formula] is a codimension three linear section of the adjoint variety of G2. Also the general Xt containing S as a hyperplane section is a general linear section of Σ by a codimension 2 subspace [formula] containing [formula]. Let [formula] be the family of all [formula]'s containing [formula]. We define F(S) as the family of all conics that lie on the threefolds [formula]. It can be seen that: (a) the 4-fold family F(S) is a disjoint union of the surfaces [formula] (see Lemma 7 below); (b) the intersection map [formula] defines an isomorphism between F(S) and Hilb2S. By (a), the family F(S) has a natural regular surjective map [formula] sending the conic q∈F(S) to the unique [formula] such that q∈F(Xt). By (b), the map f defines a regular surjective map [formula]. By the theorem of Matsushita (see [\cite=Msh]), the general fiber f- 1o(t) of fo is an Abelian surface in Hilb2S. Since by construction the general fiber f- 1o(t)≃f- 1(t) is isomorphic to F(Xt), identified with the family of conics on the general Fano 3-fold Xt  ⊃  S then F(Xt) is an Abelian surface.

The isomorphism of the Abelian surface F(X) with the intermediate Jacobian of J(X) can be derived on the base of the birational geometry of X as follows.

Let [formula] be a line. By Theorem 4.3.3(vii) of [\cite=IP], the double projection [formula] from [formula] defines a birational isomorphism from X to a 3-fold quadric Q. The double projection [formula] contracts the family of conics intersecting [formula] to a smooth curve Γ  ⊂  Q of genus 2 and degree 7; therefore the intermediate Jacobian J(X) is isomorphic to the Jacobian J(Γ) of Γ.

By Matsusaka's criterion the Abelian surface F(X) will be isomorphic to J(Γ) if we can find on F(X) a curve C≃Γ with self-intersection number C2  =  2, see [\cite=Msk]. We shall show that such a curve is the base [formula] of the family of conics on X intersecting [formula]. First, by the preceding [formula]. Next, the base of the family G(X) of lines on X is a smooth irreducible curve (of genus 10), see Theorem 4.2.7 in [\cite=IP]. Therefore all the curves [formula], [formula] are algebraically equivalent to each other on the surface F(X). So [formula] for any other line m on X. If m  ⊂  X is general then the intersection number [formula] is the number of conics q  ⊂  X that intersect both [formula] and m. But according to Theorem 4.3.3 (vii) of [\cite=IP], the conics [formula] sweep out a quadratic section [formula] of X. So [formula] intersects the line m at two points, and therefore [formula]. [formula]

For g  =  9, F(X) is a ruled surface with base a smooth plane quartic CX such that J(X)≃J(CX), see [\cite=iliev].

For g  =  8, F(X) is isomorphic to the Fano surface of lines on the unique smooth cubic threefold YX birational to X, [\cite=IMn1]. The Fano surfaces of lines on cubic threefolds have been studied in deep by Clemens and Griffiths, [\cite=CG].

For g  =  7, F(X) is isomorphic to the symmetric square Sym2CX of a genus 7 curve CX, such that J(X)  =  J(CX), see [\cite=IMr] or [\cite=Kuz].

For g = 6, the Fano surface F(X) is smooth by [\cite=logachev], Proposition 0.1.

For g = 3,4,5, the Fano threefold X is a complete intersection. This allows to describe F(X) as the zero-locus of a section of some globally generated vector bundle; in particular F(X) is smooth for X general, see [\cite=CMW] for g  =  3, [\cite=IMn2] for g = 4, [\cite=Wel] and [\cite=PB] for g = 5.

Finally, the smoothness of F(X) for g  =  2 is proved by Ceresa and Verra, see Proposition 1.14 in [\cite=CV].

We compile some numerical data for the Fano surface F = F(X) of a general prime Fano threefold X of genus g.

[formula]

We denoted by ν the number of conics through a general point of X. For the value of ν for g  ≥  8, see the table (2.8.1) in [\cite=Takeuchi]. In the cases g  =  7 and g  =  6, the numbers ν  =  24 and ν  =  39 can be computed by the same approach as in [\cite=Takeuchi], see e.g. Theorem 4.5.8 in [\cite=IP]. The computation for g = 3 is done in [\cite=CMW], and the case g = 4 is in [\cite=IMn2]. The invariants in genus 5 are in [\cite=Wel], except for the computation of ν which can be obtained with the same techniques as for g = 3,4.

For g  =  2 (as well for all the other g) for the proof of Theorem [\ref=main] we shall need in fact only the known by [\cite=CV] invariant q  =  52. Beware that in the case g  =  6 the Fano surface F(X) is the blow-up of a point on a smooth surface F; the table gives the invariants of F, see [\cite=logachev].

Intersecting conics with a K3 surface

Let S  ⊂  X be a K3 surface, defined as a general anticanonical section. Then the image of the natural map j:F(X)  →  Hilb2S is a possibly singular Lagrangian surface. In fact j can be an embedding only if g  ≥  6. Our precise result is the following:

Let X be a general Fano threefold of genus g, S a general hyperplane section. Suppose that the curve Γ(X) of lines on X is smooth, and that the Fano surface F(X) of conics on X is also smooth. Then:

j:F(X)  →  Hilb2S is an immersion.

j is injective for g  ≥  7 (but not for g  ≤  6).

Proof. The injectivity of j is equivalent to the non-existence of bisecant conics meeting along S. For g  ≥  7 this was observed in [\cite=voisin], Section 2. For g  ≤  6 this is no longer true, see the Remark below.

Nevertheless we can check that j is always immersive by applying the criterion of Corollary [\ref=criterion]. Let q∈F(X) be a smooth conic. Since F(X) is smooth at q and the normal bundle N of q in X has trivial determinant, we must have [formula] or [formula]. In both cases the evaluation map

[formula]

is injective, were [formula] the union of two distinct points or the tangent direction to q at some point.

Now we consider the case of a singular conic [formula], with vertex [formula]. Since q is a locally complete intersection, its normal bundle N = Nq / X = Hom(Iq / I2q,Oq) is a locally free Oq-module of rank two. Twisting the exact sequence [formula] by N, we get

[formula]

where [formula] is a locally-free [formula]-module. Note that since [formula], ImN is also a [formula]-module, again locally free of rank two. In fact [formula], and we have a commutative diagram

[formula]

Beware that ImN is not isomorphic with [formula], the normal bundle to [formula], although these two sheaves are obviously isomorphic outside p. In fact, there is an exact sequence

[formula]

For X general, the curve Γ(X) of lines on X is smooth, hence [formula]. So there are two possibilities: either [formula] or [formula], and the latter case occurs if and only if the map

[formula]

is not injective. Anyway, we get three possibilities:

[formula] and N(m) are both trivial, hence N itself is trivial;

[formula] is trivial but [formula] (or the opposite): then H0(N)≃H0(N(m)), and each section is defined on restriction to [formula] by its value at p;

[formula] and [formula]. Note this does not imply that [formula]: this is true only if the two distinguished directions in Np fit together, which is in fact excluded by the condition that h0(N) = 2.

Now we need to check that the evaluation map [formula] is injective, if [formula] and [formula] are distinct; if they coincide, we want [formula] to be injective. For the three possibilities above this is a straightforward verification. [formula]

Remark. For g = 6 recall that X is a complete intersection of multidegree δ = (2,1,1) in G(2,5). For any conic q in X, there is a unique hyperplane H in [formula] such that q is contained in G(2,H). Since the intersection of X with G(2,H) has degree four, it must be the union of q with an involutive conic q', which is bisecant to q. By an obvious dimension count, there must exist a finite number of conics q on X, whose two common points with the involutive conic q' lie on S - and in this case j(q) = j(q'). This shows that j(F(X)) is not smooth but has finitely many double points.

Getting back from j(F(X)) to X

It is not true in general that X is uniquely determined by the surface F(X). For example, the Fano surface of the general X22 is isomorphic to [formula], but the Fano 3-folds X22 have 6 moduli, see e.g. Corollary 1.2 in [\cite=Sch]. Similarly, one can see that the Fano surface of the general X18 is the Jacobian of the general genus 2 curve and has 3 moduli, while X18 has 10 moduli.

Here we consider a slightly different question: does j(F(X))  ⊂  Hilb2S define X uniquely among those Fano threefolds that contain S?

We do not know whether this statement is still true for g  ≤  6.

Proof. We want to recover X  ⊃  S from the embedded Lagrangian surface j(F(X))  ⊂  Hilb2(S). By [\cite=mukai1], S and X have linear embeddings in a rational homogeneous variety Σ = G / P of some simple adjoint Lie group G, and this embedding is unique up to the action of G. Therefore we may assume that S  ⊂  X  ⊂  G / P.

Now we have to consider separately the different values of g.

g = 10. Here G = G2 and G / P is the adjoint G2-variety, the variety parametrizing highest root spaces in the projectivized Lie algebra [formula].

Consider two general points x,y in the adjoint variety G2 / P. Then there is a unique conic in G2 / P passing through x and y.

Proof of the lemma. First, there exists at least one conic in G2 / P through x and y. Indeed, the Lie subalgebra of [formula] generated by x and y is a copy of [formula], and generates in G2 a copy of SL2. The SL2-orbits of x and y have the same closure, which is a conic passing through x and y in G2 / P. (To check this, choose a maximal torus in [formula] with respect to which x and y are highest and lowest root vectors.)

On the other hand, the group G2, being the automorphism group of the (complexified) algebra of octonions, has a minimal representation of dimension 7 on the imaginary octonions. Since it preserves the norm, we deduce in particular that the adjoint variety G2 / P is a sub-variety of GQ(2,7), the Grassmannian of lines in a smooth quadric Q  ⊂  P6. But through two general points of a Grassmannian of lines in a smooth quadric there exists a unique conic, which can be constructed as follows. The two points x and y represent two skew lines [formula]. These two lines generate [formula] intersecting Q along a quadric surface Sx,y. One of the two rulings of this surface contains [formula]; it defines a conic q in GQ(2,7) passing through x and y. [formula]

From j(F(X))  ⊂  Hilb2S we can therefore recover the Fano surface F(X), and then the threefold X itself since it is swept out by the conics it contains.

g = 9. Here G = Sp6 and G / P = LG(3,6), the Lagrangian Grassmannian.

Recall from [\cite=iliev] [\cite=IR] that a conic [formula] has a vertex-point [formula], defined as the unique intersection point of the Lagrangian planes [formula], t∈q.

A general conic q  ⊂  X is smooth and intersects S at two different points x,y, from which the vertex can be recovered as [formula]. In particular, j(F(X)) determines the vertex surface v(F(X)). By [\cite=iliev], for a general Fano threefold X of genus 8 the vertex image [formula] is a ruled surface isomorphic to F(X). By [\cite=IR], Proposition 2.8.5, X can be recovered as the set of projective planes in [formula] that cut the vertex surface along a finite scheme of length 12.

g = 8. Here G = PSL6 and G / P = G(2,6) is the Grassmannian of (projective) lines.

If [formula], let LX  ⊂  LS be the orthogonal in [formula] of the linear spans of S and X. They are projective spaces of dimension four and five respectively. We want to show that, the embedding j(F(X))  ⊂  Hilb2S being given, the hyperplane LX of LS is uniquely determined.

A conic q in G(2,6) whose linear span is not contained in G(2,6), defines a unique 4-space [formula] such that q  ⊂  G(2,V). Moreover, q can be obtained as the intersection of the four dimensional quadric [formula] with some projective plane. In particular, G(2,V) contains some conic of X if and only if [formula] meets [formula] along a projective space of dimension two at least. We thus consider on G = G(4,6) the tautological rank four vector bundle T. By restriction of skew-symmetric forms, we have morphisms of vector bundles

[formula]

Since φX is a general morphism from [formula] to the rank six vector bundle [formula], its degeneracy locus Σ(X) = D3(φX) has codimension (5 - 3)(6 - 3) = 6 and is singular exactly along D2(φX), which has codimension (5 - 2)(6 - 2) = 12 > 8. So Σ(X) is a smooth surface, and since it is in bijective correspondence with F(X) these two surfaces must be isomorphic.

On the other hand, the degeneracy locus Σ(S) = D4(φS) has codimension (6 - 4)(6 - 4) = 4 and is singular exactly along D3(φS), which has codimension (6 - 3)(6 - 3) = 9 > 8. So Σ(S) is a smooth four dimensional subvariety of G(4,6). On Σ(S) the morphism φS has constant rank four, so in the exact sequence

[formula]

KerφS and CokerφS are rank two vector bundles. Note that if we take determinants in this sequence, we get

[formula]

Now the normal bundle of Σ(S) in G is naturally identified with Hom(KerφS,CokerφS), whose determinant is det (CokerφS)2 det (KerφS)- 2  =  OG(6) = K- 1G. Therefore Σ(S) has trivial canonical bundle. Now the natural map Σ(S)  →  Hilb2S is finite, hence étale, hence an isomorphism since Hilb2S is simply connected. We conclude that the embedding j(F(X))  ⊂  Hilb2S is the same as the embedding Σ(X)  ⊂  Σ(S).

But from LS, its degeneracy locus Σ(S) and the embedding Σ(X)  ⊂  Σ(S), the hyperplane LX of LS can be recovered as follows. At any point x∈Σ(X), the morphisms φS ans φX have the same kernel, which in particular is contained in LX. So we must have

[formula]

And then of course X can be recovered as [formula]

g = 7. Here G = Spin10 and [formula] is the spinor variety, naturally embedded in the projectivization of a half-spin representation.

If [formula], let LX  ⊂  LS be the orthogonal in [formula] of the linear spans of S and X. They are projective spaces of dimension seven and eight respectively. Again we want to show that, the embedding j(F(X))  ⊂  Hilb2S being given, the hyperplane LX of LS is uniquely determined.

A conic q in Σ whose linear span is not contained in Σ, has a vertex [formula]. The set of isotropic planes in Σ passing through v is a copy of the spinor variety of Spin8. By triality, this spinor variety is a six dimensional quadric Qv  ⊂  Σ. Moreover, q can be obtained as the intersection of Qv with some projective plane. In particular, Qv contains some conic of X if and only if its linear space Pv meets [formula] along a projective space of dimension two at least.

This linear space Pv defines on the eight-dimensional quadric [formula] in [formula] a spinor bundle S of rank eight [\cite=ott]. We get on [formula] the morphisms of vector bundles

[formula]

Exactly as in genus eight, the degeneracy locus Σ(X) = D3(φX) is a smooth surface isomorphic with F(X). Also the degeneracy locus Σ(S) = D2(φS) is a smooth four dimensional variety with trivial canonical bundle (because det S = OQ(4)), in fact isomorphic with Hilb2S. And from the embedding Σ(X)  ⊂  Σ(S), which is the same as j(F(X))  ⊂  Hilb2S, we can recover LX in LS as before.

This concludes the proof. [formula]

Fano-Integrable Systems

Thanks to the main results of the previous section, we are now in position to apply the Donagi-Markman construction [\cite=DM]. The upshot will be new Lagrangian fibrations over families of prime Fano threefolds with a fixed "boundary", whose fibers are intermediate Jacobians.

The Abel-Jacobi isomorphism for conics on prime Fano's

The intermediate Jacobian J(X) a prime Fano threefold of genus g is an Abelian variety of dimension h1,2(X) = b3(X) / 2 (see [\cite=CG] for the definition and general properties of intermediate Jacobians).

This dimension can be computed case by case. Note that for 7  ≤  g  ≤  10, we can use the fact that X is a linear section of a d-dimensional homogeneous space [formula]. After twisting the normal exact sequence by KX  =  OX( - 1), we get

[formula]

With the help of the Bott-Borel-Weil theorem one can check that [formula] for 0  ≤  i  ≤  d - 3. Using the Koszul resolution of OX this implies that [formula]. Hence the isomorphism

[formula]

if we denote by LX the space of linear forms defining X in Σ.

Note also that if X has no automorphism, which is the general case, we get an exact sequence

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the Lie algebra of the Lie group G; hence h1(TX) = (g + 2)(d - 3) -  dim G. The analogue sequence for S is

[formula]

This gives h1(TS) - 1 = (g + 1)(d - 2) -  dim G = 19, and thus

[formula]

A basic property of the intermediate Jacobian is that for any family C  →  F of curves in X, parameterized by a smooth base F, there is an induced Abel-Jacobi mapping F  →  J(X).

Proof. For most values of g, this Abel-Jacobi isomorphism is already directly or indirectly known, so below we refer to the original references, interpret some other in the required context, and complete the argument for the genera g  =  10 and 6 missing in the known to us literature.

The case g = 12 is trivial since then h1,2(X) = 0 and F(X) is isomorphic to [formula], see § 3.1.

For g  =  10, by Proposition [\ref=g=10] the Fano surface F(X) is isomorphic to J(X) so in this case there is already nothing more to prove.

For g = 9, F(X) is a ruled surface over the orthogonal plane quartic curve CX, therefore AlbF(X) = J(CX), see § 3.1. The fact that J(CX)≃J(X) is proved in [\cite=IR], Corollary 2.8.10.

For g = 8, F(X) is isomorphic to the Fano surface F(Y) of lines in the orthogonal cubic threefold Y, see § 3.1. The intermediate Jacobians of X and Y are naturally isomorphic. The Fano surface F(X) embeds in J(X), F(Y) embeds in J(Y), and their images coincide up to a multiplication by - 1 ([\cite=IMn1], Proposition 4.6). So the Abel-Jacobi isomorphism for F(X) follows from the corresponding statement for F(Y), which is due to Clemens and Griffiths [\cite=CG].

For g = 7, F(X) is isomorphic to Sym2CX, where CX is the Spin10-orthogonal curve to X, see § 3.1. From where AlbF(X)≃J(CX). As known by § 8 of [\cite=mukai2] the Jacobian J(CX) is isomorphic to J(X), see also [\cite=IMr].

For g  =  3, the Abel-Jacobi isomorphism for F(X) has been proved by Letizia, by applying a degeneration technique originating from Clemens, see [\cite=Let]. After that, the same method had been used by Ceresa and Verra (see [\cite=CV]), Picco Botta (see [\cite=PB]) and in our recent paper [\cite=IMn2] to prove the same result correspondingly for g  =  2,5 and 4.

The case g  =  6 has been treated by Logachev (before the appearance of the paper [\cite=Let]) with the conclusion that AlbF(X)  →  J(X) in an isogeny, by following an earlier argument of Welters proving the same isogeny for the case g  =  5, see Theorem 6.12 in [\cite=logachev] and [\cite=Wel]. In fact, the Clemens-Letizia method applies also in the case g  =  6 to conclude that the Abel-Jacobi map is an isomorphism also for g  =  6. All the necessary conditions for this (a precise description of the Fano surface for a general nodal Fano threefold) are provided in Section 5 of [\cite=logachev]. [formula]

The intermediate Jacobian integrable systems for prime Fano's

Consider a projective symplectic variety Y of dimension 2n, a smooth variety L of dimension n and a Lagrangian immersion f:L  →  Y. Then:

If L  →  H is a local semi-universal deformation of f, with fixed target Y, then H = Def(f / Y) is smooth ([\cite=Ran], Corollary 3.4).

The tangent space to H at L is

[formula]

where the bundle Nf is defined by the exact sequence 0  →  TL  →  f*TY  →  Nf  →  0; indeed the fact that f is Lagrangian yields an isomorphism Nf≃Ω1L.

Any small deformation of f remains a Lagrangian immersion in Y, see [\cite=voisin].

The relative Picard bundle Pic0L  →  H is a Lagrangian fibration (or an algebraic completely integrable Hamiltonian system), see [\cite=DM]. In fact Donagi and Markman only treat the case where j is an embedding, that is, they consider the deformations of a smooth Lagrangian subvariety in a symplectic manifold. Nevertheless, their proof extends verbatim to the setting of Lagrangian immersions.

Let X be a general prime Fano threefold of genus g and S a K3 surface in X. We can apply the results above to f = j:L = F(X)  →  Y = Hilb2S, since we have proved in Proposition [\ref=immers] that j is indeed a Lagrangian immersion. We get that the family Pic0L over Def(j / Hilb2S) is a Lagrangian fibration.

Now we want to deform X with S fixed. The tangent space to the corresponding deformation functor is [formula] (see [\cite=beau3]). Since IS  =  OX( - S) = KX, this is also H1(Ω2X), the universal covering of J(X).

We begin with a simple observation.

There exists a semi-universal algebraic family HS parameterizing deformations of X containing S.

Proof. Suppose for example that 7  ≤  g  ≤  10 (in which case j is an embedding). Recall that by Mukai's theorem, S can be described as a linear section [formula] of a d-dimensional homogeneous space Σ by a projective space of codimension d - 2. The set of prime Fano threefolds X containing Š as an anticanonical section, is then identified with an open subset of the orthogonal projective space [formula].

In the complete intersection case, consider for example the general quartic threefold [formula] admitting S as a hyperplane section. The set of such X's is given by the set of quartic polynomials of the form k = kS + x0c, where x0 is an equation of the hyperplane H spanned by S in [formula], kS is an equation of S in H, and c is any cubic form. So the smooth quartic hypersurfaces of [formula] containing S are parameterized by an open subset of a 35-dimensional affine space. Moreover the 5-dimensional subgroup ΓH of GL5, acting trivially on H, acts on this affine space, and any linear subspace transverse to the orbit of X defines a semi-universal, 30-dimensional, deformation of X with S fixed. The other cases are similar. [formula]

We have a natural map from the germ (HS,X) to Def(j / Hilb2S), whose differential

[formula]

is an isomorphism when the Abel-Jacobi isomorphism does hold. In particular we can pull-back our Lagrangian fibration to HS, first locally, and then everything globalizes since the fibration is defined canonically - more precisely, we can pull it back to the open subset H0S on which X is smooth, F(X) is also smooth and the Abel-Jacobi isomorphism theorem does hold. But then over H0S, Pic0F(X)≃AlbF(X)*≃J(X)*≃J(X), the intermediate Jacobian being self-dual. Since this isomorphism certainly holds in families, we finally deduce our main result:

For g  ≥  7 the situation is even cleaner: one can take for HS an open subset of the projective space LS, and by Theorem [\ref=back] there is a birational isomorphism between LS and the component H of the Hilbert scheme of Hilb2S parameterizing the Lagrangian surfaces jF(X), for X a general Fano threefold containing S.
