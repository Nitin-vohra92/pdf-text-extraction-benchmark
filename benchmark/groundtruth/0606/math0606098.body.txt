Determinantal representations of smooth cubic surfaces

Introduction

In this paper we study determinantal representations of nonsingular (smooth and irreducible) cubic surfaces. Our first objective is to explicitly construct the correspondence in the following classical result which is, for instance, stated in [\cite=beauville]. This construction originates in Clebsch [\cite=clebsch]. It was probably known already in the 19th century, but it is difficult to find a modern reference.

A smooth cubic surface S in [formula] allows exactly 72 nonequivalent determinantal representations. There is a one-to-one correspondence between:

equivalence classes of determinantal representations of S,

linear systems of twisted cubic curves on S,

sets of six lines on S that do not intersect each other.

Our second objective is to use the explicit construction and study the existence and number of self-adjoint determinantal representations of smooth real cubic surfaces. Such a representation exists if and only if there is a mutually self-conjugate double-six on S. Our main results are the following: Depending on the Segre type Fi, i = 1,2,3,4,5, a smooth real cubic surface has 0,2,4,6 or 24, respectively, nonequivalent self-adjoint determinantal representations. Surfaces of types [formula] have no definite determinantal representations, while a surface of type F5 has 16 definite determinantal representations.

The theory of cubic surfaces has a long history. (See [\cite=dolgachev] for a brief outline of the history.) It is known since 1849 [\cite=cayley] that a smooth cubic surface contains 27 lines. This discovery is one of the first results on surfaces of higher degree and is considered by many as the start of modern algebraic geometry. Many mathematicians contributed to the understanding of rich geometry of smooth cubic surfaces. We refer to Henderson [\cite=henderson] or Reid [\cite=miles] for the geometry of the 27 lines and to Hilbert and Cohn-Vossen [\cite=hilbert] for the geometry of a Schläfli's double-six. It may be hard to find modern references on the geometry of cubic surfaces (an exception being Dolgachev's lecture notes [\cite=dolgachevwww] available on the web) and many of the results have been known in the 19th century [\cite=clebsch] [\cite=cre1] [\cite=scroter]. A great source for the geometry of real cubic surfaces is Segre [\cite=segre].

The history of determinantal representations is shorter. Still, Dixon [\cite=dixon] showed in 1902 that every curve has a determinantal representation. Dickson [\cite=dickson] considered determinantal representations of general varieties and showed, among other, that every smooth cubic surface has a determinantal representation. Later, determinantal representations in general where studied by many authors, for instance [\cite=beauville] [\cite=cook] [\cite=room], and those of cubic surfaces for instance by [\cite=logar] [\cite=logar2] [\cite=geramita]. Recently, Vinnikov gave a complete description of equivalence classes of determinantal representations for smooth curves [\cite=vinnikov2] and of self-adjoint and definite determinantal representations of smooth real curves [\cite=vinnikov] [\cite=vinnikov3]. Brundu and Logar [\cite=logar] [\cite=logar2] considered singular cubic surfaces and showed that all, except those containing one line only, have determinantal representations.

Our main motivation to study determinantal representations comes from possible application to multiparameter spectral theory [\cite=KosirMST]. Classification of (selfadjoint) determinantal representations of algebraic hypersurfaces is equivalent to simultaneous classification of tuples of (selfadjoint) matrices. Classically, determinantal representations were used to study the rationality of varieties. Vinnikov [\cite=vinnikov2] [\cite=vinnikov3] stressed another very important motivation to study self-adjoint and definite determinantal representations. They appear as determinantal representations of discriminant varieties in the theory of commuting nonselfadjoint operators in a Hilbert space [\cite=LKMV].

To conclude the introduction we give a brief outline of the paper. In the second section we review the geometry of the 27 lines that we use in the construction. In the third section we give the explicit construction for the correspondence between a set of six skew lines on a cubic surface and a determinantal representation in a special form, which we call a representation of type [formula]. In the fourth section we construct the correspondence between equivalence classes of determinantal representations and systems of twisted cubic curves on S. As an example we consider the Fermat cubic surface. In sections 5 and 6 we present our results on self-adjoint and definite determinantal representations of smooth real cubic surfaces.

Classical projective geometry of the 27 lines

Let k be an algebraically closed field and S a projective cubic surface defined by a smooth polynomial F(z0,z1,z2,z3) of degree 3 over k. We will briefly state some classical results in order to introduce the notation.

The most elegant way to study curves on S (our particular interest will be in lines and twisted cubics) is by defining S as a blow up of 6 points in the plane, no three collinear and not on a conic. Every nonsingular cubic surface in [formula] can be obtained this way. Namely, the linear system of plane cubic curves through assigned points [formula] defines an embedding of S in [formula] This way the study of curves on S reduces to study of certain plane curves. The 27 lines on S are then the following (see e.g. [\cite=hartshorne]):

[formula] are the exceptional lines,

cij is the strict transform of the line through Pi and Pj in [formula] where 1  ≤  i < j  ≤  6.

[formula] with bj being the strict transform of the plane conic through the five Pi, i  ≠  j.

Observe that [formula] are mutually skew, [formula] are mutually skew and ai intersects bj if and only if i  ≠  j. Every configuration of 12 lines on S with this property is called a Schläfli's double-six. Every smooth cubic surface S contains 36 double-sixes of lines. The 27 lines have a high degree of symmetry: for any set [formula] of mutually skew lines on S there exist 6 points in [formula] and a blow-up for which [formula] are the exceptional lines. Proof of this can be found in [\cite=hartshorne]. These lines then uniquely determine another set of 6 mutually skew lines to form together a double-six. Using the above notation the double-sixes on S are:

[formula]

Here i,k,l,m,n,p are all distinct. Let us also mention that a half of a double six, i.e., a set of six lines from any three columns of a double-six, belongs to a uniquely determined double-six. This can be easily seen by checking the list of all double-sixes.

There are many more interesting properties of the configuration of 27 lines. A plane intersecting S in three lines is called a tritangent plane. The plane

[formula]

spanned by concurrent lines bi,aj intersects the cubic surface S in another line cij. Note that [formula] intersects S in the same line cij. (See for instance [\cite=miles].) Every line on S lies exactly on 5 tritangent planes. In the sequel we will use the same symbol for the plane and for its defining linear form. So, the plane π is defined by the equation π = 0.

Determinantal representations versus sixes of skew lines

A determinantal representation of S is a 3  ×  3 matrix of linear forms

[formula]

satisfying

[formula]

where [formula] and c∈k, c  ≠  0.

Every nonsingular cubic surface S has a determinantal representation. We will use the relation between a determinantal representation and six points of the blow-up that gives S, which can be found in the proof of the existence of a determinantal representation M in [\cite=geramita]. Consider the 4-dimensional linear system of plane cubic curves through 6 assigned points [formula] A basis F1,F2,F3,F4 of the linear system defines a blow-up of [formula] By the Hilbert-Burch theorem there exists a 3  ×  4 matrix L of linear forms in x0,x1,x2 whose minors are F1,F2,F3,F4. Note that L has generically rank 3 and it has rank 2 exactly at points [formula] Define a 3  ×  3 linear matrix M in variables z0,z1,z2,z3 by

[formula]

One can easily check that M is a determinantal representation of S.

Conversely, to a given determinantal representation M we can assign L by ([\ref=enacba1]) above. The rank of L in [formula] equals 2 if and only if the three planes in [formula] with equations

[formula]

intersect in a line. Note that the lines obtained this way are exactly the exceptional lines of the blow-up [\cite=geramita]. They are mutually skew and we call them the six skew lines corresponding to determinantal representation M.

Two determinantal representations M and M' are equivalent if there exist [formula] such that

[formula]

If the determinantal representations M and M' are equivalent then the corresponding sets of 6 skew lines are equal.

Let [formula] be the lines corresponding to M over points [formula] as above and let M' = XMY with [formula] Then

[formula]

and so the line over Pi for M is the same as the line over Y- 1Pi for M'.

In the rest of the section we will explicitly construct all (up to equivalence) determinantal representations from the 27 lines on S.

We fix an arbitrary set of six mutually skew lines on S. Without loss of generality name them [formula]. There is a unique set of 6 skew lines on S such that

[formula]

is a double-six. Consider the tritangent planes

[formula]

defined in ([\ref=piij]). On S they intersect in 9 lines

[formula]

which together with another point on S outside these lines determine F. This follows from the fact that cubic surfaces are parametrized by the points in [formula], whereas 9 lines and a point induce 2  ·  9 + 1 = 19 conditions. Then F = π12π23π31  +  λπ13π21π32 for some nonzero λ∈k, and we may without loss assume that λ = 1. Thus

[formula]

Note that [formula] is a determinantal representation of S. We say that a determinantal representation is of type [formula] if it is in the above form. Similar form was considered in [\cite=kollar].

The two sets of six skew lines corresponding to [formula] and to its transpose [formula] form the double-six [formula], which was our construction's input data.

From the construction it is obvious that the intersections of planes corresponding to

[formula]

are a1,a2,a3, respectively, and those corresponding to

[formula]

are b1,b2,b3, respectively.

There exist three more points [formula] such that the intersections of planes given by

[formula]

induce skew lines l4,l5,l6, respectively.

Observe that

[formula]

and that b1 lies on all these tritangent planes. These planes are all different since they contain different lines that are skew. Because every two lines in a plane intersect, b1 intersects a2,a3,l4,l5,l6 and is disjoint with a1. In the same way we prove that b2 intersects a1,a3,l4,l5,l6, but not a2, and that b3 intersects a1,a2,l4,l5,l6, but not a3.

Applying the same arguments to [formula] yields 6 mutually skew lines b1,b2,b3,l'4,l'5,l'6 and relations: a1 intersects b2,b3,l'4,l'5,l'6,, but not b1, a2 intersects b1,b3,l'4,l'5,l'6, but not b2,  a3 intersects b1,b2,l'4,l'5,l'6, but not b3. These relations are fulfilled if and only if the above lines form a double-six and the remaining lines l4,l5,l6 and l4',l'5,l'6 have to be equal to a4,a5,a6 and b4,b5,b6, respectively. (See Section 2.)

We have set everything needed to prove the converse of Lemma [\ref=conv]. We will show that every determinantal representation of S is equivalent to one of type [formula].

If determinantal representations M and M' of S define the same set of six skew lines then they are equivalent.

Let [formula] be the set of lines corresponding to M over the points [formula]. It suffices to prove that M is equivalent to the representation [formula]. We will prove the statement by explicitly constructing the equivalence.

Consider representation

[formula]

which is equivalent to M. Since the three planes in [formula] given by linear equations

[formula]

intersect in a line (a1 actually), there exists a nontrivial linear combination

[formula]

i.e., α1,β1,γ1∈k are not all equal to zero. After multiplying M' from the left by an invertible constant matrix

[formula]

we obtain 0 in the (1,1)th entry.

Observe that the (1,2)th and (1,3)th entries of A1M' are nonzero since F is irreducible. The planes in the second column of A1M' again intersect in a line, namely a2. Therefore there exists a nontrivial combination of these planes with coefficients (α2,β2,γ2) different from a multiple of (1,0,0). By multiplying A1M' from the left by an invertible matrix

[formula]

we obtain 0 on the (2,2)th place.

Observe that the (1,3)th and (2,3)th entry of A2A1M' are not proportional, and thus both nonzero. By the same argument as above, there exists a linear combination with coefficients (α3,β3,γ3) of the entries of third column of A2A1M' with γ3  ≠  0.

Finally,

[formula]

is such that

[formula]

has zeros along the diagonal.

Since M'' is equivalent to M' the intersections of planes given by the entries of

[formula]

induce the lines a1,a2,a3, respectively, and there exist three more points in [formula], namely

[formula]

such that the intersections of planes corresponding to

[formula]

induce a4,a5,a6, respectively.

Consider now the transpose representation (M'')t and its first corresponding line l defined as intersection of the planes corresponding to the entries of

[formula]

Observe that

[formula]

and that l lies on all these tritangent planes. These planes are all different since they contain different lines that are skew. Since every line of S lies on 5 tritangent planes it follows that [formula], otherwise l and a1 would span another tritangent plane. Because every two lines in a plane intersect, l intersects a2,a3,a4,a5,a6 and is disjoint with a1. Therefore l = b1. We continue in the same way to prove that

[formula]

and

[formula]

We claim that mij'' yields an equation of the tritangent plane πij. Indeed, the plane mij'' contains the lines bi and aj. The incidence relation can be read from the diagram

[formula]

This means that there exist nonzero α,α',α'',β,β',β'' in k such that αα'α'' = ββ'β'' and

[formula]

which is equal to

[formula]

We proved that

[formula]

which shows that M is equivalent to the representation [formula] of ([\ref=R]).

Note also that Lemma [\ref=conv] and Proposition [\ref=mainth] prove that there is a bijective correspondence between the equivalence classes of determinantal representations of S and sets of six skew lines on S. The proof provides an explicit construction of the correspondence.

If the lines [formula] correspond to M and the lines [formula] correspond to Mt, then [formula] and [formula] form a double-six.

We proved that M is equivalent to [formula] because they induce the same 6 lines [formula]. Then Mt and [formula] are also equivalent and by Lemma [\ref=conv] induce the same set of lines [formula] By Proposition [\ref=doublrem] they form together a double-six.

A smooth cubic surface can not have a symmetric determinantal representation.

Determinantal representations and twisted cubic curves

So far we proved and explicitly constructed correspondence between equivalence classes of determinantal representations of S and sixes of skew lines on S. More precisely, there is 1-1 correspondence between pairs M,  Mt and double-sixes.

In this section we find 1-1 correspondence between equivalence classes of determinantal representations and linear systems of twisted cubics on S.

The notion of equivalent representations is strongly connected to the equivalence of the following line bundles. If M is a determinantal representation for S, define the corresponding vector bundle ε along S by

[formula]

Since S is nonsingular, ε is a line bundle by

The corresponding vector bundle of a determinantal representation of a smooth surface is of rank one.

Let

[formula]

satisfy M  =  cF and denote by Aij the (i,j)th 2nd-order cofactor of M. Using the formula for the differentiation of a determinant and row expansion we get

[formula]

At every regular point of F not all partial derivatives are 0 and therefore not all 2  ×  2 minors of M are 0. Thus M has rank 2.

Next we introduce the adjoint matrix

[formula]

whose (i,j)th entry is the (j,i)th cofactor of M. From the identity

[formula]

and Lemma [\ref=dimone] we immediately deduce that

every entry of [formula] is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 2,

matrix [formula] has rank 1 at every point on S.

Thus on S every column of [formula] is in ker M and its zero locus, i.e. the zero locus defined by the entries of a column, is a twisted cubic curve on S. (See e.g. [\cite=harris].) Since det M  ≠  0 we get three different twisted cubic curves corresponding to the columns of [formula] (which are equivalent as effective divisors on S). In other words, the columns define a basis of a 2-dimensional linear system of twisted cubic curves on S. We call any of twisted cubic curves obtained above a twisted cubic corresponding to determinantal representation M.

Recall the identification [\cite=shaf] of line bundles with invertible sheaves. In other words, we could define ε corresponding to M by an exact sequence

[formula]

The invertible sheaf ε defined in such a way is obviously supported on S. By [\cite=cook] matrices M and M' are equivalent if and only if the corresponding sheaves ε and ε' are isomorphic. Note that ([\ref=enac2]) induces long exact sequence with

[formula]

and hence

[formula]

has dimension 2.

Moreover, Beauville [\cite=beauville] proves that the cokernel of [formula] is isomorphic to OS(C), where C is a smooth projectively normal curve on S of degree 3 and genus 0. Thus C is a twisted cubic on S as we have already seen. By [\cite=hartshorne] [formula] if and only if C and C' are equivalent as effective divisors on S. We can conclude that our linear system of twisted cubic curves is in fact a complete linear system 0(S,OS(C)) of a twisted cubic curve C corresponding to M.

Equivalent determinantal representations induce the same linear system of twisted cubic curves.

Let M be a determinantal representation of S. The columns of the adjoint matrix [formula] form a basis of the corresponding linear system of twisted cubics on S. In other words

[formula]

where qi are quadratic polynomials and r,t rational functions on S.

It is now obvious that an equivalent representation [formula] induces the same linear system, just another basis.

It remains to show that every linear system of twisted cubics on S indeed comes from some representation.

Consider S as a blow-up of 6 points of the plane and denote by [formula] the linear equivalence classes of the exceptional lines. Let L∈  S be the pull-back of a line in [formula]

[\cite=hartshorne] Let S,Ai and L be as above. Then:

[formula] is generated by [formula] and L;

an effective divisor [formula] on S has degree

[formula]

as a curve in [formula]

the self-intersection of D is

[formula]

where pa denotes the arithmetic genus of D.

The following is a well known result.

Every smooth cubic surface S contains 72 linear systems of twisted cubic curves.

We need to count all nonequivalent effective divisors [formula] on S of degree d = 3 and genus pa = 0. We will show that the only integers satisfying these conditions are

[formula]

Recall Schwarz's inequality for real sequences

[formula]

and take [formula] By Proposition [\ref=divhart] we find

[formula]

Solving the quadratic equation for α we get 1  ≤  α  ≤  5. One quickly obtains all possible integers βi by trial.

Recall representation [formula] of ([\ref=R]) corresponding to the double-six [formula]. Its adjoint is equal to

[formula]

The zero locus of the first column is a degenerated twisted cubic consisting of lines

[formula]

As divisors, the 27 lines on S are:

[formula]

This follows from the discussion in § 2 of S as a blow-up of six points. Thus the degenerated twisted cubic curve corresponding to the first column of [formula] is an effective divisor

[formula]

It now follows easily that twisted cubics corresponding to equivalent representations (or the same set of six skew lines) are linearly equivalent as divisors on S. And a different set of six skew lines induces a linearly nonequivalent divisor, i.e. different linear system of twisted cubic curves.

This proves that on S there are exactly 72 linear systems of twisted cubics, each corresponding to a set of six skew lines and concludes a proof of Theorem [\ref=thm1].

Self-adjoint determinantal representations

From now on let the ground field k be the complex field [formula]. In Corollary [\ref=symm] we saw that a smooth cubic surface cannot have symmetric determinantal representations. It is natural to ask whether a real surface S (i.e., a surface such that all the coefficients of the defining homogeneous polynomial F are real) admits a self-adjoint determinantal representation. We will consider a determinantal representations U(z0,z1,z2,z3) satisfying

[formula]

and

[formula]

Assume that [formula]. By Proposition [\ref=mainth] there exists an equivalent representation

[formula]

with zeros along the diagonal. Note that [formula] and [formula] are equivalent representations since

[formula]

and thus they correspond to the same six skew lines. We denote by [formula] the double-six corresponding to [formula] and [formula]. The exact relations are the following:

[formula]

and

[formula]

for some [formula]. This gives a necessary condition for S to have a self-adjoint determinantal representation. In fact, we will prove that it is sufficient as well.

A real smooth cubic surface S has a self-adjoint determinantal representation if and only if there exists a double-six

[formula]

and [formula] such that

[formula]

It remains to show that the condition is sufficient. From the given double-six we construct a determinantal representation [formula] with zeros along the diagonal, such that its columns induce a1,a2,a3 and its rows induce b1,b2,b3. Then our assumption implies that [formula] induces the same six skew lines and is thus equivalent to [formula]. This means

[formula]

for some [formula]

Recall that the intersections of planes given by the columns of [formula]

[formula]

induce the lines a1,a2,a3, respectively. Since [formula] is equivalent to [formula] there exist uniquely determined points

[formula]

such that the intersections of planes corresponding to

[formula]

also induce a1,a2,a3, respectively. Evaluate ([\ref=itisdiag]) on the vectors of the standard basis to prove that

[formula]

for some nonzero [formula].

Next observe that [formula] over the standard vectors induces the lines [formula], respectively. In the same way [formula] over [formula] again induces [formula]. Consider the transpose of ([\ref=itisdiag])

[formula]

This equality evaluated on the vectors of the standard basis implies that

[formula]

for some nonzero [formula].

Thus we proved that

[formula]

Then ([\ref=itisdiag]) becomes

[formula]

Since [formula] is a determinantal representation of an irreducible surface, at most one entry in each row or column is zero. This implies that D = γ  Id for some |γ| = 1 and the representation

[formula]

is self-adjoint.

A double-six [formula] is called mutually self-conjugate if [formula] as sets. Using the fact that a half of the double-six uniquely determines the whole double-six we get the following:

A real smooth cubic surface S has a self-adjoint determinantal representation if and only if there exists a mutually self-conjugate double-six on S.

Next we consider all nonequivalent self-adjoint representations of a given real cubic surface S. In Segre [\cite=segre] we find the following classification:

A nonsingular real cubic surface can only be one of the 5 types specified in the table:

After a suitable permutation of indexes, a mutually self-conjugate double-six is one of the following 4 types: a double-six of the I-st kind is of the form

[formula]

a double-six of the II-nd kind is of the form

[formula]

a double-six of the III-rd kind is of the form

[formula]

and a double-six of the IV-th kind is of the form

[formula]

Moreover, all mutually self-conjugate double-sixes are specified by

The four kinds of mutually self-conjugate double-sixes were introduced by Cremona [\cite=cre1].

Every mutually self-conjugate double-six induces two nonequivalent self-adjoint determinantal representations. As a consequence we obtain the following result.

A real cubic surface has the following number of nonequivalent self-adjoint determinantal representations:

Two self-adjoint determinantal representations U1, U2 of S are equivalent if and only if U1 is hermitean equivalent to either U2 or - U2.

Assume that U1 and U2 are equivalent. Then there exist [formula] such that U2 = XU1Y.

Observe that

[formula]

is self-adjoint. Denote [formula] by Z. Then

[formula]

Recall that there exist 6 unique points in general position [formula], such that for every i equations

[formula]

define three planes which intersect in the line ai. We can conclude from ([\ref=zismultid]) that Z is a real multiple of the identity matrix. Indeed, for [formula] evaluate ([\ref=zismultid]) on (ζi,ηi,ξi), which shows that

[formula]

Because the 6 points are in general position, every subset of 3 points generates a basis for [formula]. Therefore all λi are equal. Moreover, ([\ref=zismultid]) implies that λi is real and thus Z is a real multiple of Id.

This means that [formula] for some [formula] and

[formula]

which concludes the proof.

Definite determinantal representations

In this section we consider the following question: when do the 4 coefficient matrices of a self-adjoint determinantal representation of a cubic surface admit a real linear combination which is positive definite?

A self-adjoint determinantal representation U = z0U0 + z1U1 + z2U2 + z3U3 of S is called definite if there exist [formula] such that

[formula]

and is indefinite otherwise.

A nonzero vector [formula] is self-orthogonal vector of U if

[formula]

Note that the notions defined above are projectively invariant. Furthermore, the definiteness is preserved under hermitean equivalence of determinantal representations. Clearly, a determinantal representation with a self-orthogonal vector is indefinite.

Every self-adjoint determinantal representation of a surface of types F2,F3 and F4 has a self-orthogonal vector and is therefore indefinite.

In Section [\ref=selfadjsec] we saw that self-adjoint determinantal representations are induced by mutually self-conjugate double-sixes. Every double-six of a surface of type F2 is of the I - st kind and the corresponding representation of type [formula] is of the form

[formula]

Since, [formula], and similarly [formula] and [formula], it follows that the representation is self-adjoint and each of the coordinate vectors, e.g., [formula], is self-orthogonal.

Double-sixes of the II - nd and III - rd kind are, after a reordering of lines in the latter case, of the form

[formula]

The corresponding representation of type [formula] and an equivalent representation are

[formula]

The latter representation is self-adjoint since [formula] and [formula] are real planes and

[formula]

Moreover, the vector [formula] is its self-orthogonal vector. Hence all the self-adjoint determinantal representations of a surface of types F2,F3 and F4 are indefinite.

Recall the self-adjoint representation of Fermat surface from Example [\ref=exexex]:

[formula]

It is easy to check that [formula] is a self-orthogonal vector of U.

It is natural to ask whether the coefficients of every indefinite determinantal representation of S have a self-orthogonal vector. We will see in Example [\ref=exF5] that the answer is no.

Every real cubic surface of type F5 has up to equivalence 16 definite determinantal representations (among the 24 nonequivalent self-adjoint representations).

Before we prove the theorem we recall some facts about the geometry of real cubic surfaces of type F5 which are found in Segre [\cite=segre].

The real part of a real cubic surface of type F5 consists of two disconnected components, one of which is ovoidal. On the other hand, the real part of real cubic surfaces of types F1, F2, F3 and F4 consist of a single connected component.

We denote a real cubic surface of type F5 by F5 and we write [formula] for its real part. Then F5 has 3 real lines all of which are coplanar and lie in the non-ovoidal piece. Through every real line there are 4 additional tritangent planes, each intersecting F5 in 2 conjugate lines of the 1st kind. Thus F5 has 13 = 1 + 3  ×  4 real tritangent planes. The 24 conjugate lines form 12 self-conjugate double-sixes of the IV - th kind.

A parabolic plane through a real line r is by definition the plane on which r is tangent to the residual conic of intersection with the surface. The touching point is called a parabolic point of r. Segre proves that every real line of a real cubic surface F5 contains 2 real parabolic points.

Note that a tritangent plane intersects the real part of [formula] in either three real lines or in a union of a real line and a point which is the real intersection point of the two conjugate complex lines of the tritangent plane. This point may lie on the real line. In fact, it lies on the real line if and only if it is an Eckardt point. (If all three lines on a tritagent plane meet in one point then such a point is called an Eckardt point.)

Now fix a real line r on F5 and consider real planes through r. Among those there are:

2 parabolic planes λ, λ',

2 tritangent planes β, β' that intersect the ovoidal piece of [formula],

2 tritangent planes γ, γ' that do not intersect the ovoidal piece of [formula].

Now we view our surface affinely and we consider an orientation on the pencil of real planes with axis r. We start with the plane α through the 3 real lines and fix a direction of rotation around r. All the above planes are real and occur in the following order (see Figures [\ref=pict5] and [\ref=pict6]):

[formula]

Note that λ and γ may coincide. This happens if and only if the conjugate lines on γ and r intersect in an Eckardt point. The same holds for λ' and γ'. No other planes can coincide.

The ovoidal part of F5 is wedged between β and β' and the non-ovoidal between γ' and γ with respect to the above fixed orientation. On the other hand the interior of wedges between γ, β and β', γ' do not intersect [formula].

Fix a double six of the IV-th kind:

[formula]

The corresponding determinantal representation of type [formula] is

[formula]

First we find a self-adjoint determinantal representation equivalent to [formula]. Planes π12 and π21 are real and intersect in a real line on F5. By Proposition [\ref=doublrem] there exists a point [formula] such that the three planes corresponding to

[formula]

intersect in the line [formula]. Then U =

[formula]

is self-adjoint since

[formula]

(after multiplying π23 and π13 by real constants if necessary) and

[formula]

is real.

To determine when the above determinantal representation U is definite we introduce a system of quadratic forms:

[formula]

Observe that

[formula]

is the determinant of U and therefore a defining equation of F5.

Note that U is definite if and only if Q contains a definite quadratic form, or equivalently, if there is a real point [formula] such that π12(P),π21(P) and F5(P) are all positive or all negative.

Planes π12 and π21 divide [formula] into two wedges where π12,  π21 either have the same or different signs. We will prove that the non-ovoidal component of [formula] lies in the wedge in which the values π12 and π21 have different signs. Consider the real line in [formula] and choose a real point P on it, that is not on π13 or π23. Evaluate ([\ref=pipi]) in P to see that the values π12(P) and π21(P) must have different signs.

Recall the geometry of real planes around the line r. It follows that the wedge where π12,  π21 have the same sign either contains the ovoidal piece, or the interior of the wedge does not intersect the real part of F5. In the first case there exists a point in which π12,  π21 and ([\ref=pipi]) have the same sign, which makes the form Q(P) definite.

In the second case all the quadratic forms of Q are non-definite. Indeed, the plane π43 cuts the wedge where π12,  π21 have the same sign. In the intersecting points ([\ref=pipi]) has exactly the opposite sign to π12,  π21. Since the intersection with [formula] is empty, the sign differs along the whole wedge.

After fixing a direction of rotation around r, the 4 tritangent planes through r cut out 6 different wedges (i.e., different choices of π12, π21) in which the wedging two planes are either both positive or negative. From Figure [\ref=pict5] we see that 4 wedges contain the ovoidal piece of [formula] and thus induce positive-definite representations. The remaining 2 wedges induce non-definite representations.

Recall that every surface of type F5 contains 12 mutually self-conjugate double-sixes of the IV-kind which induce 24 self-adjoint determinantal representations. For a given

[formula]

the wedges where the planes πi,i + 1 and πi + 1,i i = 1,3,5, have the same sign either all contain the ovoidal piece or their interior does not intersect [formula]. We have proved that [formula] of the wedges where both planes have the same sign contain the ovoidal piece. Thus it follows that out of 24 self-adjoint determinantal representations 16 are definite.
