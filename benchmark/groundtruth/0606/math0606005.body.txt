Free Arrangements over Finite Field

Proposition Theorem Lemma Corollary Remark Problem Example Proposition and Definition

Introduction

A hyperplane arrangement A in an [formula]-dimensional vector space V is a finite set of linear subspaces of codimension one. An arrangement A is said to be free when the associated module of logarithmic vector fields is a free module. Study of arrangements of this class was started by K. Saito [\cite=sai-log] and a remarkable factorization theorem was proved by H. Terao [\cite=ter-free]. This theorem asserts that the characteristic polynomial χ(A,t) of a free arrangement completely factors into linear polynomials in [formula]. It imposes a necessary condition on the structure of intersection lattice L(A) for an arrangement A to be free. The Terao conjecture is the problem to ask the converse: does the structure of L(A) characterize freeness of A? This conjecture is still open even in the case [formula]. The purpose of this paper is to propose an affirmative result over finite field [formula] in the case [formula]. Our main result asserts that if the number of hyperplanes satisfies |A|  ≥  2q - 2, then A is free exactly when χ(A,q)χ(A,q - 1) = 0. Proofs are based on Terao's addition-deletion theorem (Theorem [\ref=thm:addel]) and Crapo-Rota's method of counting points by using characteristic polynomials (Theorem [\ref=thm:1], Theorem [\ref=thm:cra-rot]).

Freeness and characteristic polynomials

Let V be an [formula]-dimensional linear space over a field [formula] and [formula] be the algebra of polynomial functions on V that is naturally isomorphic to [formula] for any choice of basis [formula] of V*. A (central) hyperplane arrangement A is a finite collection of one-codimensional linear subspaces (=  hyperplanes) in V. For each hyperplane H of A, fix a nonzero linear form αH∈V* vanishing on H and put [formula].

The characteristic polynomial of A is defined as

[formula]

where L(A) is the lattice consisting of intersections of elements of A, ordered by reverse inclusion, : = V is the unique minimal element of L(A) and [formula] is the Möbius function defined as follows:

[formula]

Fix a hyperplane H∈A, we obtain two associated arrangements: deletion [formula] and restriction [formula]. The characteristic polynomials for these arrangements satisfy the following inductive formula

[formula]

Denote by [formula] the S-module of all polynomial vector fields over V. For a given arrangement A, we define the module of logarithmic vector fields as

[formula]

An arrangement A is said to be free, if D(A) is a free S-module, and then the multiset of degrees [formula] of homogeneous basis of D(A) is called the exponents. The following theorems are due to H. Terao.

Let V be an [formula] dimensional vector field over a finite field [formula] of q elements and Aall(V) be the collection of all hyperplanes in V. Put

[formula]

Then for any linear form α, δkα  =  αk. Hence δk∈D(Aall). From Saito's criterion [\cite=sai-log], [formula] form a basis of D(Aall) and exponents are [formula].

Arrangements over finite fields

If [formula] is a finite field, the characteristic polynomial χ(A,t) has a special meaning. The following theorem and its proof is found in [\cite=orl-ter], and it is a special version of more general result obtained in [\cite=cra-rot] (see also Theorem [\ref=thm:cra-rot] below).

This theorem has successfully applied by Athanasiadis [\cite=ath-cha] to compute characteristic polynomials for arrangements defined over [formula].

An arrangement A over a field [formula] can be naturally considered as an arrangement over an extended field [formula]. Since field extensions do not change the intersection lattice, the characteristic polynomial is also unchanged. Hence from Theorem [\ref=thm:1], we have

[formula]

Not only χ(A,q), but also χ(A,qk) expresses the cardinality of points of complement of arrangement [formula]. We have the following lemma.

Let A, A1 and A2 be arrangements in [formula], then

χ(A,qk)  ≥  0 for all [formula].

If A1  ⊂  A2, then χ(A1,qk)  ≥  χ(A2,qk) for all [formula].

The following Theorem is due to H. Crapo and G. -C. Rota. It contains Theorem [\ref=thm:1] as a special case (k = 1). Here we deduce from Theorem [\ref=thm:1].

Proof. Recall that [formula] is an k-dimensional vector space over [formula]. Let [formula] be a [formula]-basis of [formula]. Then the point P in [formula] is expressed as

[formula]

where [formula]. Since the defining equation of [formula] is a linear form with coefficients in [formula], the point P is contained in [formula] if and only if

[formula]

Hence P is in the complement of arrangement [formula] if and only if for each H∈A, there exists at least one [formula] such that [formula]. So this gives a bijection between complement of [formula] and ordered k points in [formula] satisfying (*). [formula]

The next result is shown immediately from Theorem [\ref=thm:cra-rot], but we give an alternative proof, since the arguments used in the proof is prototypical for later.

Let A be an arrangement in [formula]. If the characteristic polynomial satisfies χ(A,qk) = 0 for some k, then χ(A,qj) = 0 for 0  ≤  j  ≤  k.

Proof. The proof is done by induction on the dimension [formula] and "descending" induction on the number |A| of hyperplanes. If |A| is maximal, in other words, [formula], then the characteristic polynomial is

[formula]

so the lemma is trivial. In the case [formula] is also trivial. In general, let A' be an arrangement such that [formula] and assume χ(A',qk) = 0. We can find a hyperplane H which is not contained in A' and define [formula]. From Lemma [\ref=lem:easy], we have χ(A',qk)  ≥  χ(A,qk) = 0. From the inductive hypothesis on the number of hyperplanes, we have

[formula]

Denote A'' the restriction [formula], we have χ(A'',qk) = χ(A',qk) - χ(A,qk) = 0. Since [formula], we have

[formula]

Again from inductive formula, we have χ(A',qj) = 0,0  ≤  j  ≤  n. [formula]

Using the above lemma, we can characterize [formula].

Proof. (a)⇔  (b)⇔  (c)⇒  (d) is trivial. (d)⇒  (c) is from the above lemma. [formula]

Here we assume [formula], and give some combinatorial characterization for freeness.

Let A be an essential free arrangement in [formula] with exponents (1,d2,d3). If d2  ≤  d3, then d2  ≤  q.

Proof. Note that d2 is the minimal degree of the logarithmic vector field δ∈D(A) which does not a polynomial multiple of the Euler vector field δ0 (see Example [\ref=ex:all] for the notation). Since δ1 is contained in D(A), such a minimal degree can not be greater than q =  deg δ1. [formula]

Proof. (1) Suppose that χ(A,q) = 0. We prove the freeness by descending induction on |A|. Recall that A  =  Aall is free with exponents (1,q,q2) (see Example [\ref=ex:all]). In general, choose a hyperplane H which is not a member of A. Then by Lemma [\ref=lem:easy], we have

[formula]

hence [formula]. From the inductive hypothesis, [formula] is free with exponents (1,q,|A| - q). Then Theorem [\ref=thm:addel] enable us to conclude that A is free.

(2) Suppose A is free. Note that from the assumption on |A|, A is an essential arrangement. Hence the characteristic polynomial is of the form χ(A,t) = (t - 1)(t - d2)(t - d3) with integers d2  ≤  d3 which satisfy d2 + d3 = |A| - 1  ≥  2q - 1. From the Lemma [\ref=lem:ineq], we have d2  ≤  q  ≤  d3. However d2 < q < d3 contradicts the Lemma [\ref=lem:easy] (i) χ(A,q)  ≥  0, we have either

[formula]

[formula]

By a similar argument to (1), we have the following theorem for higher dimensional cases.

The argument used in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:2q] (1) can be considered as an example of "supersolvable resolution" in [\cite=zie-mat].

In the next result we will treat the cases |A| = 2q - 1 and 2q - 2.

Proof. (1) The similar arguments above from the fact χ(A,q)  ≥  0 shows that the freeness of A implies χ(A,t) = (t - 1)(t - q + 1)2. Conversely, suppose χ(A,t) = (t - 1)(t - q + 1)2, then

[formula]

This means that there exists a line [formula] such that

[formula]

Choose a hyperplane H containing L, then [formula] is free with exponents (1,q - 1,q). Again by using Theorem [\ref=thm:addel], we conclude that A is free with exponents (1,q - 1,q - 1). (2) can be proved similarly. [formula]

We can summarize the results as follows.

([\cite=zie-mat]) Let us fix a line [formula], and define an arrangement A1 by

[formula]

We can easily seen that |A1| = 9 > 2  ×  3. Since [formula], A1 is not free. However, in [\cite=zie-mat], Ziegler proved the following. Let A2 be an arrangement in [formula] satisfying [formula]. If the characteristic of the field [formula] is not 3, then A2 is free with exponents (1,4,4).
