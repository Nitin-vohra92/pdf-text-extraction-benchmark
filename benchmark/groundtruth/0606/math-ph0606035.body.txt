On adelic model of boson Fock space

Neretin Yu.A.

We construct a canonical embedding of the Schwartz space on [formula] to the space of distributions on the adelic product of all the p-adic numbers. This map is equivariant with respect to the action of the symplectic group [formula] over rational numbers and with respect to the action of rational Heisenberg group.

These notes contain two elements. First, we give a fanny funny???? realization of a space of complex functions of a real variable as a space of functions of p-adic variable. Secondly, we try to clarify classical contstruction of modular forms through θ-functions and Howe duality.

Introduction

Fields and rings. Below [formula] denotes the rational numbers, [formula] is the ring of integers, [formula] is the field of p-adic numbers, [formula] is the ring of p-adic integers. We denote the norm on [formula] by |  ·  |.

Adeles, (see [\cite=GGP], [\cite=Wei], [\cite=PR]). An adele is a sequence

[formula]

where [formula], [formula] (p is a prime) and |ap| = 1 for all p except a finite a number of primes.

Our main object is the ring

[formula]

consisting of the sequences

[formula]

satisfying the same conditions. The addition and multiplication in [formula] are defined coordinate-wise. Below the term "adeles" means the ring [formula]. The space of sequences of the form ([\ref=R-A]) we denote by [formula].

Convergence in [formula]. A sequence a(j) in [formula] converges to a∈A iff

a) There is a finite set S of primes such that |a(j)p| = 1 for all p∉S for all j.

b) For each p, the sequence a(j)p converges in [formula].

The image of the diagonal embedding [formula]

[formula]

is dense in [formula].

Integration. We define the Lesbegue measure da on the ring [formula] by two assumptions:

- the measure on [formula] is the product-measure

- the measure is translation-invariant.

This measure is σ-finite. We define the space [formula] in the usual way. The Bruhat space [formula] defined below is dense in [formula].

Adelic exponents. For an adele [formula], we define its exponent [formula] by

[formula]

all the factors are roots of unity, only finite number of factors is ≠  1.

Lattices. A lattice L in a [formula]-linear space [formula] is an arbitrary additive subgroup isomorphic [formula]. Equivalently, a lattice is a group [formula] having a form [formula], where fj is a basis in [formula]. A dual lattice [formula] consists of [formula], such that [formula] for all the x∈L.

A lattice in the p-adic linear space [formula] is a set of the form [formula], where fj is a basis in [formula]. The standard lattice is the set [formula].

A lattice in the adelic module [formula] is a set of a form [formula] where [formula] are lattices, and Lp are the standard lattices for all p except a finite set.

For a lattice [formula], consider its closure [formula]. It is a lattice, and moreover the map [formula] is a bijection of the set of all the lattices in [formula] and the set of all the lattices in [formula].

Bruhat test functions and distributions on [formula]. A test function f on [formula] or on [formula] is a compactly supported locally constant complex-valued function. The Bruhat space [formula] (resp. [formula]) is the space of all the test functions.

A distribution is a linear functional on [formula] (resp. [formula]). We denote the space of all the distributions by [formula] (resp. [formula]).

The second description of the spaces B. Let S be a subset in [formula] or [formula]. Denote by IS the indicator function of S, i.e.

[formula]

For a lattice L and a vector a, the function [formula] is a test function. Each test function is a linear combination of functions of this type.

Third description of the spaces B. Consider the space [formula] or [formula]. Let K  ⊂  L be lattices. Denote by B(L|K) the space

a) f = 0 outside L.

b) f is K-invariant.

The dimension of this space is the order of the quotient group L / K, in particular the dimension is finite.

Then

[formula]

The space [formula]. We repeat literally the previous definition. For two lattices [formula], denote by M(L|K) the space of K-invariant functions on [formula] supported by L. We assume

[formula]

The space [formula] is generated by the indicator functions IL + a of shifted lattices.

The bijection [formula].

a) Each function [formula] admits a unique continuous extension [formula] to a function on [formula]

b) The map [formula] is a bijection [formula].

The statement is trivial. More constructive variant of this is statements is

[formula]

Space [formula] of Poisson distributions. Denote by [formula] the Schwartz space on [formula], i.e. the space of smooth functions f on [formula] satisfying the condition: for each α1,, αn, and each N

[formula]

By [formula] denote the space dual to [formula], i.e., the space of all tempered distributions on [formula].

Now we intend to define a certain subspace [formula]. This space is spanned by functions

[formula]

where a1, , [formula] are linear independent, [formula].

A countable sum ψ of δ-functions is an element of [formula] iff there are two lattices [formula] such that ψ is supported by [formula] and ψ is [formula]-invariant.

We denote by [formula] the space of all the distributions satisfying this Lemma.

Canonical bijection [formula]. Define a canonical bijective map [formula]. Let [formula], let [formula] be corresponding lattices. We define the distribution [formula] as

[formula]

We obtain the bijection [formula]. Also, for each rational lattices K  ⊂  L, we have a bijection

[formula]

Observation. Thus we have the canonical bijection

[formula]

In particular, we have canonical embeddings

[formula]

The image of the Schwartz space in [formula].

For [formula], the corresponding element [formula] is

[formula]

where [formula] is the adelic delta-function.

Proof. Let [formula] be a lattice, [formula]. The value of the adelic distribution [formula] on the adelic test function [formula] is

[formula]

The last expression is the value of the Poisson distribution [formula] on the Schwartz function f. [formula]

Result of the paper. The space [formula] is equipped with the canonical action of the real Heisenberg group [formula] and the real symplectic group [formula] (in this sense, [formula] is a bosonic Fock space mentioned in the title).

The space [formula] is equipped with the canonical action of the adelic Heisenberg group [formula] and the adelic symplectic group [formula].

There are canonical embeddings

[formula]

in all the cases the images are dense.

a) The map [formula] commutes with the action of [formula].

b) The map [formula] commutes with the action of [formula].

For [formula] denote by [formula] its Fourier transform. Then the adelic Fourier transform of the distribution ([\ref=adelic-delta]) is

[formula]

For each [formula], there is a congruence subgroup in [formula] that fixes f.

Another description of the operator [formula]. Consider the space [formula] (in fact, it is the adelic space in the usual sense). Consider the tensor product [formula], and consider the linear functional (Poisson-Weil distribution) on this space given by

[formula]

Our operator [formula] is the pairing

[formula]

Rational Heisenberg group

Heisenberg group. By [formula] we denote the group of (1 + n + 1)  ×  (1 + n + 1)-matrices

[formula]

Here v+, v- are matrices-rows, vt- is a matrix-column, the sign t is the transposition. We have

[formula]

We consider 4 Heisenberg groups, [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], this means that matrix elements of ([\ref=heis-matrix]) are elements of [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula].

The group [formula] is a dense subgroup in [formula], [formula] [formula].

The standard representations of Heisenberg groups. These representations are given by almost the same formulae for the rings [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], but these formulae differs by position of factors 2π.

Real case. The group [formula] acts in the Schwartz space [formula] on [formula] by the transformations

[formula]

This formula also defines unitary operators in [formula] and continuous transformations of the space [formula] of the space of tempered distributions on [formula].

Adelic case. The group [formula] acts on the space [formula] by the formula

[formula]

This formula also defines unitary operators in [formula] and continuous operators in the space [formula] of adelic distributions.

p-adic case. The action of [formula] on [formula] and [formula] is defined by the same formula.

Rational case. The group [formula] acts in the space [formula] via the same formula ([\ref=adeli-heis]).

Relations between the standard representations of [formula].

a) The subgroup [formula] preserves the space [formula].

b) The canonical map [formula] commutes with the action of [formula].

c) The canonical bijection [formula] commutes with the action of [formula].

This statement is more-or-less obvious. It also implies Theorem [\ref=th:main].a.

Irreducibility.

The representation of [formula] in [formula] is irreducible. Any operator [formula] commuting with the action of [formula] is a multiplication by a constant.

Proof. First, we present an alternative description of the space M(L|K), it consists of functions fixed with respect to operators

[formula]

The space M(L|K) is point-wise fixed by the group G(L|M) generated by these operators.

The space M(L|K) is invariant with respect to the group D(L|K) generated by the operators Tv, where v∈L, and Sw, where [formula].

Hence the quotient-group A(L|M) = D(L|M) / G(L|M) acts in M(L|M). In fact, this group is generated by the same operators Tv, Sw, see ([\ref=sdvig])-([\ref=exp]), but now we consider v as an element of L / M and w as an element of [formula] (in fact, A(L|M) is a finite Heisenberg group).

Let us show that the representation of A(L|M) in the space M(L|M) is irreducible. The subgroup of A(L|M) generated by the operators Sw has a simple specter, its eigenvectors are δ-functions on L / M. Hence any invariant subspace is spanned by some collection of δ-functions. But Tv-invariance implies the triviality of an invariant subspace.

Now the both statements of the Lemma become obvious. [formula]

Weil representation

On the Weil representation, see [\cite=Wei], [\cite=Ner], [\cite=KV], [\cite=Naz].

Symplectic groups. Consider a ring [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula]. Consider the space [formula] equipped with a skew-symmetric bilinear form with the matrix [formula]. By [formula] we denote the group of all the operators in [formula] preserving this form, we write its elements as block matrices [formula].

An element of the adelic symplectic group [formula] also can be considered as a sequence [formula], where [formula], and [formula] for all the p except finite number.

Automorphisms of the Heisenberg groups. Let [formula]. The symplectic group [formula] acts on the Heisenberg group [formula] by automorphisms

[formula]

see ([\ref=heis-product]).

Real case.

a) For each [formula], there is a unique up to a factor unitary operator [formula] such that for each [formula]

[formula]

b) For each g1, [formula],

[formula]

where [formula]. Moreover, there is a choice of [formula], such that c(g1,g2) =   ±  1 for all g1, g2.

Thus [formula] is a projective representation of [formula]. It is named the Weil representation.

It is easy to write the operators [formula] for some special matrices g,

[formula]

where the matric B is symmetric, B = Bt.

Since these elements generate the whole group [formula], our formulae allow to obtain [formula] for an arbitrary [formula].

The space [formula] is invariant with respect to the action of the group [formula].

Proof. Obviously, [formula] is invariant with respect to operators ([\ref=weil-r-1]), ([\ref=weil-r-3]) with rational matrices A, B.

By the Poisson summation formula, [formula] is invariant with respect to the Fourier transform ([\ref=weil-r-2]).

It can be readily checked that the group [formula] is generated by elements of these 3 types, and this finishes the proof. [formula].

p-adic Weil representation. For the group [formula], the literal analog of Theorem [\ref=th:weil-r] is valid. In this case the operators [formula] are unitary in [formula] and preserve the Bruhat space [formula].

Analogs of formulae ([\ref=weil-r-1])-([\ref=weil-r-2]) also can be easily written,

[formula]

Remark. After an appropriate normalization of operators [formula], we can obtain

[formula]

see also Proposition [\ref=pr:gamma-12]

Adelic Weil representation. We have

[formula]

in the first case we have a tensor product in the category of Hilbert spaces, in the second case we have a tensor product in the category of abstract linear spaces.

Remark. To define a tensor products of an infinite family of spaces Vj, we need in a distingueshed unit vector ej in each space, the tensor product space [formula] is spanned by products [formula], where vj = ej for all j except a finite set. [formula]

The Weil representation of [formula] is defined as [formula] These operators are unitary in [formula] and preserve the dense subspace [formula]. For almost all [formula], we have [formula] and this allows to define tensor products of operators.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=th:main].b. Transfer the representations of [formula] from the spaces [formula], [formula] to the space [formula]. We obtain two representations of [formula] in [formula], say [formula], [formula]. These operators satisfy the commutation relations

[formula]

Hence [formula] commutes with T(h). By Lemma [\ref=l:lemma], [formula], where [formula]. [formula]

Addendum. Constructions of modular forms

Here we explain the standard construction of modular forms from theta-functions and Howe duality, see [\cite=Sch], [\cite=Igu], [\cite=Mum], [\cite=LV].

Congruence subgroups. Consider the group [formula] of symplectic matrices [formula] with integer elements. For a positive integer N, denote by ΓN the principal congruence-subgroup consisting of matrices [formula] such that N divides all the matrix elements of g - 1. A congruence subgroup in [formula] is any subgroup including a principal congruence-subgroup.

For the following statement, see, for instance, [\cite=Ven]

The subgroup in [formula] generated by matrices

[formula]

where α, β, γ, (1 + lδ)- 1 are integer matrices, is a congruence subgroup

The subgroup Γ1,2. The denote by Γ1,2 the subgroup of [formula] consisting of [formula] such that the matrices AtC and BtD have even elements on the diagonals. For the following theorem, see [\cite=Mum]).

The group Γ1,2 is generated by matrices

[formula]

where the matrices B, C have even diagonals.

Denote

[formula]

The restriction of the Weil representation of [formula] to Γ1,2 is a linear representation. Moreover, we can normalize the operators [formula], g∈Γ1,2, such that

[formula]

Proof. First, Δ is an eigenvector for operators [formula], g∈Γ1,2. It is easy to verify this for generators of Γ1,2, and hence this is valid for all g. Now we can choose the normalization ([\ref=we-delta]). Now [formula] became a linear representation of Γ1,2. [formula]

Congruence subgroups and the space [formula].

The stabilizer of each element of [formula] in the group Γ1,2 is a congruence subgroup.

Proof. It is easy to verify (see Theorem [\ref=th:generators]) that the subgroup U2N2 fix all the vectors of [formula]. [formula]

Modular forms of the weight 1 / 2. Denote by Wn the Siegel upper half-plane, i.e., the set of n  ×  n complex matrices satisfying the condition [formula]. The group [formula] acts in the space of holomorphic functions on Wn by the following operators

[formula]

Consider the operator

[formula]

from [formula] to our space of holomorphic functions. It is easy to verify, that this operator intertwines the Weil representation and the representation T1 / 2.

By Proposition [\ref=pr:gamma-12], for g∈Γ1,2, we can normalize the operators ([\ref=1/2])

[formula]

and obtain a linear representation of Γ1,2 (in fact, λ(g) ranges in 8-th roots of 1).

Let [formula] be a Poisson distribtion, Φ = Jχ. There is a congruence subgroup Γ  ⊂  Γ12 such that

[formula]

In fact, Theorem [\ref=th:modular-origin] provides lot of possibilities to produce modular forms. For instance, consider some embedding [formula] such that [formula]. Assume that the restriction of the Weil represntation to [formula] contains a subrepresentation V of a discrete series. Then we can consider projection of the space [formula] to V.
