Boundary integral operator for the fractional Laplacian in the bounded smooth domain

Introduction

In this paper, we study a boundary integral operator defined on the boundary of a bounded domain in [formula]. Let Ω be a bounded smooth domain and [formula] be the Riesz kernel of order 2α,    0  <  2α  <  n in [formula], where c(n,2α) is the normalized constant. The layer potential of a fractional Laplacian for φ∈Lp(∂Ω),  1  <  p  <    ∞   is defined by

[formula]

The boundary integral operator

[formula]

is defined by the restriction of S2αφ over ∂Ω.

M. Zähle studied the Riesz potentials in a general metric space (X,ρ) with Ahlfors d-regular measure μ. She showed S2α:L2(X,dμ)  →  L22α(X,dμ), 0  <  2α  <  n is invertible, where L2(X,dμ) is decomposed by the null space N(S2α) and the orthogonal compliment of N(S2α), that is, [formula] (see [\cite=Z] and [\cite=Z2]).

The author of [\cite=C] showed that the boundary integral operator S2α defined in [\eqref=boundary-restriction] is extended to [formula] such that [formula] is bijective operator and [formula] for [formula] (see section [\ref=function_spaces] for the definition of the function spaces).

When 2α = 2, Γ2 is the fundamental solution of the Laplace equation in [formula] and [\eqref=boundary_integral_operator] is a single layer potential of the Laplace equation. The single layer potential and boundary layer potential of the Laplace equation were studied by many mathematicians to show the existence of the solution of the boundary value problem of the Laplace equation in a bounded domain (see [\cite=FJR], [\cite=FMM], [\cite=JK] and [\cite=V]).

The first result of this paper is the following Theorem.

The function space H2α - 1p(∂Ω) is defined in the section [\ref=function_spaces].

The layer potential for φ∈Bsp(∂Ω),  s  <  0,  1  <  p  <    ∞   is defined by

[formula]

where <    ·  ,  ·    >   is the duality paring between Bsp(∂Ω) and [formula]. In particular, if φ∈Lp(∂Ω), then S2αφ is defined by [\eqref=boundary_integral_operator]. The second result is the following Theorem. The function spaces [formula] and [formula] are defined in the section [\ref=function_spaces].

The boundary integral operators (the single layer potential and the double layer potential) have been studied by many mathematicians. The bijectivity of the layer potential has been used to show the existence of the solutions of the partial differential equations in a bounded domain or bounded cylinder (see [\cite=B1], [\cite=B2], [\cite=DKV], [\cite=FKV], [\cite=HL], [\cite=M] and [\cite=She]).

As in the vast literature, we apply the bijectivity of the boundary integral operator to the boundary value problem of the fractional Laplace equation in the bounded smooth domain. The fractional Laplacian of order 0  <  α  <  1 of a function [formula] is expressed by the formula

[formula]

where C(n,α) is some normalization constant. The fractional Laplacian can also be defined as a pseudo-differential operator

[formula]

where [formula] is the Fourier transform of v in [formula]. In particular, when 2α = 2 it is the Laplacian [formula].

In fact, if u is weak solution, then u is continuous function in [formula] and satisfies

[formula]

(See Theorem 3.9 in [\cite=BB]).

For the application of Theorem [\ref=theo1] and Theorem [\ref=theo0905], we show the existence of the solution of the boundary value problem of the fractional Laplace equation in the bounded smooth domain.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In section [\ref=function_spaces], we introduce the several function spaces. In section [\ref=operator], we introduce the several property of the layer potential. In section [\ref=bijectivity-single], we prove the Theorem [\ref=theo1]. In section [\ref=proof-maintheo], we prove the Theorem [\ref=theo0905]. In section [\ref=proof-maintheo-2], we prove the Theorem [\ref=theo2-1].

Function spaces

Function spaces in [formula].

In this section, we introduce the several function spaces, Sobolev space and Besov space. For [formula], we consider a distribution Gs whose Fourier transform in [formula] is defined by

[formula]

For [formula], we define the Sobolev space [formula] by

[formula]

where *   is a convolution in [formula] and [formula] is the dual space of the Schwartz space [formula]. In particular, when [formula] and 1  <  p <   ∞  ,

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] for [formula].

For [formula], we define the Besov space [formula] and homogeneous Besov space [formula] by

[formula]

with the norms

[formula]

If [formula] is negative, then we define Bsp and [formula] as the dual spaces of B- sp' and [formula], respectively, where [formula]. The real interpolation method and complex interpolation method give

[formula]

for [formula] (see theorem 6.4.5 in [\cite=BL]).

Function spaces in Ω.

Let Ω be bounded C2-domain in [formula]. Let RΩf be a restriction over Ω of the function f defined in [formula]. For s  ≥  0, we define the function spaces

[formula]

with norms

[formula]

where infimums are taken in [formula] and [formula], respectively, such that RΩF = f.

Note that for non-negative integer k and 1  <  p  <    ∞  ,

[formula]

and for 0  <  θ  <  1,

[formula]

where s  =  θk1  +  (1  -  θ)k2 (see chapter 2 in [\cite=JK]). In particular, for k  <  s  <  k + 1, we have

[formula]

For negative [formula], we define Bsp(Ω) and Hsp(Ω) as the dual spaces of B- sp'(Ω) and H- sp'(Ω), respectively, where [formula].

For s  >  0, we define the spaces Hsp0(Ω) and Bsp0(Ω) as the closures of C∞c(Ω) in Hsp(Ω) and Bsp(Ω), respectively.

Function spaces in ∂Ω.

Let Ω be a bounded C2-domain in [formula]. Let us [formula] for P∈∂Ω. Then, there is r0  >  0 such that for all P∈∂Ω, there is bijective C2-function Ψ:B'(0,r0)  →  Δ(P,r0), where B'(0,r0) is open balls in [formula] whose radius is R and center is origin. Since Ω is bounded domain, there are [formula] such that [formula]. Moreover, there are bijective C2-functions Ψi:B'(0,r0)  →  Δ(Pi,r0). Now, we say that φ is in function space Hsp(∂Ω),   - 2  ≤  s  ≤  2 if [formula] for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  N. And the norm is

[formula]

Similarly, we define the function space Bsp(∂Ω). Clearly, for 0  <  s < 2, H- sp(∂Ω) and B- sp(∂Ω) are dual spaces of Hsp'(∂Ω) and B- sp'(∂Ω), [formula], respectively.

For 0  <  θ  <  1,

[formula]

where s = (1 - θ)k1  +  θk2 (see chapter 2 in [\cite=JK]).

Boundary layer potential

Let S2α be a boundary layer potential defined by [\eqref=def-single-dual]. Because of ∂Ω is C2, we get the following Proposition:

Let Ω be C2 bounded domain. For  - 2  ≤  s  ≤  3 - 2α and 1  <  p  <    ∞  ,

[formula]

is bounded operator. Moreover, for - 1  ≤  s  ≤  0,

[formula]

is bijective.

(See [\cite=V]). Let ψ,    φ∈C2(∂Ω) and S*2α:H- s  -  2α + 1p'(∂Ω)  →  H- sp'(∂Ω) is a dual operator of [\eqref=dual], where [formula]. Using [\eqref=boundary_integral_operator], we have

[formula]

where <    ·  ,  ·    >   is the duality paring between Hs  +  2α - 1p(∂Ω) and [formula], and <  <   ·  ,  ·   >  >  is the duality paring between Hsp(∂Ω) and [formula]. Since C2(∂Ω) is dense subset of Hsp(∂Ω), [\eqref=dual2] implies that S*2α:H- s  -  2α + 1p'(∂Ω)  →  H- sp'(∂Ω) is a same operator with S2α:H- s  -  2α + 1p'(∂Ω)  →  H- sp'(∂Ω) for s  <  0.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=theo1]

To prove the Theorem [\ref=theo1], we need the following Lemma.

Let [formula]. Given sufficiently small ε  >  0, there are bounded linear operators T1:Lp(∂Ω)  →  H1p(∂Ω) with [formula] and T2:H- 1p(∂Ω)  →  H1p(∂Ω) such that

[formula]

Since S2:Lp(∂Ω)  →  H1p(∂Ω) is bijective, for sufficiently small ε > 0, S2  +  T1:Lp(∂Ω)  →  H1p(∂Ω) is bijective.

Since S2, S2αS3 - 2α and T2 are bounded operators from H- 1p(∂Ω) to Lp(∂Ω), T1:H- 1p(∂Ω)  →  Lp(∂Ω) is also bounded operator. Then, by the complex interpolation property [\eqref=0310], we get that for - 1  <  s < 0,

[formula]

By the argument of (1), (2) and by Proposition [\ref=props-2], we get S2  +  T1:Hsp(∂Ω)  →  H1 + sp(∂Ω),     - 1  <  s  <  0 is bijective.

Proof of Lemma [\ref=lemm0916]. Let 0  <  9ε  <  r0, where r0 > 0 is defined in a section [\ref=inpaomega]. Let [formula] such that |Pi - Pj|  >  ε and [formula]. Let {ηi}1  ≤  i  ≤  m be a partition of unity of {B(Pi,2ε)}1  ≤  i  ≤  m such that [formula] in [formula]. Let [formula] and [formula] such that supp  κi  ⊂  B(Pi,7ε) and supp  λi  ⊂  B(Pi,9ε). Then, for φ∈Lp(∂Ω), we have

[formula]

Note that for P∈Δ(Pi,2ε), κi(  ·  )Γ2α(P  -    ·  ) has no singularity in [formula] and so I2φ is a smooth function.

For I1φ, we have

[formula]

For fixed Z∈Δ(Pi,7ε), Γ3 - 2α(Z -   ·  ) has no singularity in [formula] and so [formula] is a smooth function in ∂Ω. Hence, by Proposition [\ref=props-2], I12φ is a smooth function.

Similarly, we decompose S2φ as

[formula]

where J12φ,    J2φ are smooth functions and

[formula]

with [formula].

For I11φ,    J11φ, we fix i. Using the translation and rotation, we assume that Pi = 0 and there is Ψ:B'(0,9ε)  →   with

[formula]

such that for Q∈Δ(Pi,9ε):  =  Δi9ε, Q is represented by Q  =  (y',Ψ(y')) for some y'∈B'(0,9ε):  =  B'(9ε). Let P  =  (x',Ψ(x')),    x'∈B'(0,2ε). Then, we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

Let

[formula]

Note that by [\eqref=Phi], we have

[formula]

(See [\cite=CMM]).

It is well-known

[formula]

(See Section 5.1 in [\cite=St].) Hence, we have

[formula]

Hence, we have that

[formula]

is a smooth function. Let [formula] and [formula]. Then, S2αS3 - 2α  =  S2  +  T1  +  T2 such that T2 is a smooth function and

[formula]

Hence, we complete the proof of Lemma [\ref=lemm0916]. [formula]

Proof Theorem [\ref=theo1].

(1). In the case of [formula] (p0  <  2). To show the injectivity, suppose that S2αφ = 0 for φ∈Lp(∂Ω). By the H[formula]lder inequality and Sobolev imbedding, we have [formula]. Hence, by the bijectivity of [formula] (see [\cite=C]), we have φ = 0. Hence, S2α:Lp(∂Ω)  →  H2α - 1p(∂Ω) is bijective for p  ≥  p0.

To show that S2α:Lp(∂Ω)  →  H2α - 1p(∂Ω) is surjective, let f∈H2α - 1p(∂Ω). By the Sobolev imbedding and the H[formula]lder inequality, we have [formula]. By the bijectivity of [formula], there is [formula] such that S2αφ  =  f. Note that by the Lemma [\ref=lemm0916], we get that S3 - 2αS2α  =  S2  +  T1  +  T2, where [formula] and T2:H- 12(∂Ω)  →  H12(∂Ω) is bounded. Then, by the Lemma [\ref=lemm0916], we obtain that (S2  +  T1)φ  =  S3 - 2αS2αφ  -  T2φ∈H1p(∂Ω). Taking ε > 0 sufficiently small such that S2  +  T1:Lp(∂Ω)  →  H1p(∂Ω) is bijective (see (1) of the Remark [\ref=rem0821]), we obtain that φ∈Lp(∂Ω). This implies that S2α:Lp(∂Ω)  →  H2α - 1p(∂Ω) is surjective. Hence, we complete the proof of the bijectivity of S2α:Lp(∂Ω)  →  H2α - 1p(∂Ω) for [formula]. [formula]

Note that the dual operator S*2α:H- 2α + 1p'(∂Ω)  →  Lp'(∂Ω) of S2α:Lp(∂Ω)  →  H2α - 1p(∂Ω) are same with the operator S2α:H- 2α + 1p'(∂Ω)  →  Lp'(∂Ω), where [formula] by the section [\ref=operator]. Hence, by the property of the dual operator, we get that S2α:H- 2α + 1p(∂Ω)  →  Lp(∂Ω) is bijective for [formula].

In the Lemma [\ref=lemm0916], S3 - 2αS2α is sum of a bijective operator S2  +  T1 and a compact operator T2 and so S3 - 2αS2α is the Fredholm operator with index zero. Since S2α:Lp(∂Ω)  →  H2α - 1p(∂Ω), S3 - 2α:H2α - 1p(∂Ω)  →  H1p(∂Ω) are injective, S3 - 2αS2α is injective and so by the Fredholm operator theorem, S3 - 2αS2α:Lp(∂Ω)  →  H1p(∂Ω) is bijective. This implies that S3  -  2α:H2α - 1p(∂Ω)  →  H1p(∂Ω) is bijective for [formula].

(2). In the case of 1 < p < 2. Now, we will show that S2α:H- 2α + 1q(∂Ω)  →  Lq(∂Ω) is surjective for [formula]. Let f∈Lq(∂Ω). By the H[formula]lder inequality, Lq(∂Ω)  ⊂  L2(∂Ω) and by the bijectivity of S2α:H- 2α + 12(∂Ω)  →  L2(∂Ω) (see (1) of Remark [\ref=rem1021]), there is φ∈H- 2α + 12(∂Ω) such that S2αφ  =  f. Then,

[formula]

By (3) of Remark [\ref=rem0821], we obtain that (S2  +  T1)φ∈H2 - 2αq(∂Ω). Since S2  +  T1:H- 2α + 1q(∂Ω)  →  H2 - 2αq(∂Ω) is bijective (see (3) of Remark [\ref=rem0821]), we obtain that φ∈H- 2α + 1q(∂Ω). This implies that S2α:H- 2α + 1q(∂Ω)  →  Lq(∂Ω) is surjective.

By the property of the dual operator, we have that S*2α:Lp(∂Ω)  →  H2α - 1p(∂Ω),  1  <  p  <  2 are injective. Since S*2α  =  S2α, S2α:Lp(∂Ω)  →  H2α - 1p(∂Ω) is injective and so S2α:H2α - 1p(∂Ω)  →  H1p(∂Ω) is injective. Hence, we get S2αS3 - 2α:Lp(∂Ω)  →  H1p(∂Ω),  1  <  p < 2 are injective.

Note that in (3) of Remark [\ref=rem0821], S2αS3 - 2α is the sum of a bijective operator and a compact operator. Hence, by the Fredholm theorem, S2αS3 - 2α:Lp(∂Ω)  →  H1p(∂Ω) is bijective.

To show that S2α:Lp(∂Ω)  →  H2α - 1p(∂Ω) is surjective for 1  <  p  <  2, let us f∈H2α - 1p(∂Ω). Then, we have S3 - 2αf∈H1p(∂Ω). Since, S3 - 2αS2α:Lp(∂Ω)  →  H1p(∂Ω) is bijective, there is φ∈Lp(∂Ω) such that S3 - 2αS2αφ  =  S3 - 2αf. Since S3 - 2α is injective, we get S2αφ = f and so S2α:Lp(∂Ω)  →  H2α - 1p(∂Ω) is bijective. [formula]

In the proof of the Theorem [\ref=theo1], we have S3 - 2α:Lp(∂Ω)  →  H2 - 2αp(∂Ω),    S2α:H2 - 2αp(∂Ω)  →  H1p(∂Ω) are injective and so S2αS3 - 2α:Lp(∂Ω)  →  H1p(∂Ω) is injective. Since S2αS3 - 2α:Lp(∂Ω)  →  H1p(∂Ω) is Fredholm operator with index zero, we get S2αS3 - 2α:Lp(∂Ω)  →  H1p(∂Ω) is bijective. This implies

[formula]

By the dual operator property and the fact of S*2α  =  S2α, we have

[formula]

Using [\eqref=1016-1], [\eqref=1016-2] and the properties of the real interpolation and complex interpolation, we obtain the corollary.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=theo0905]

We introduce a Riesz potential I2α, 0  <  2α  <  n, by

[formula]

where [formula].

The following proposition is well known fact and will be useful in the subsequent estimates (see chapter 5 of [\cite=St]).

Let [formula]. Then

[formula]

is bounded.

Let 1  <  p  <    ∞   and [formula]. Then, the following operators are bounded.

[formula]

Let BR be the open ball in [formula] centered at the origin with radius R. Then, by proposition [\ref=prop2], the following operator is bounded.

[formula]

Proof of [\eqref=0904] Let [formula]. Let φ∈C1(∂Ω) and f∈C∞c(BR). Then, we have

[formula]

Since C1(∂Ω) is dense subspace of Bsp(∂Ω) and C∞c(BR) is dense subspace of [formula], we have

[formula]

where [formula]. Then, we have

[formula]

Hence, we have

[formula]

We complete the proof of [\eqref=0904]. [formula]

Proof of [\eqref=0904-2]. For [formula], let us u be a the layer potential of φ defined by [\eqref=def-single-dual]. Note that u is in [formula] and for large |x|, we have

[formula]

where [formula].

Let BR be an open ball whose center is origin and radius is R  ≥  2 such that [formula]. We divide the left-hand side of [\eqref=0904-2] into three parts

[formula]

By [\eqref=0904], A1 is dominated by [formula]. For |x|  ≤  R and |y|  ≥  2R, we get that [formula]. Note that by [\eqref=behavior2], for |y|  ≥  2R, we have that [formula]. Hence, by [\eqref=0904], we have

[formula]

We divide A3 into two parts;

[formula]

Applying the mean-value theorem, for [formula], there is a ξ between x and y such that Dkxu(x)  -  Dkyu(y)  =  Dk + 1u(ξ)  ·  (x - y). Note that [formula] and hence [formula]. Since [formula] and [formula], by [\eqref=behavior2], the first term of [\eqref=homo-divide2] is dominated by

[formula]

Since |x|,    |y|  ≥  R, by [\eqref=behavior2], the second term of [\eqref=homo-divide2] is dominated by

[formula]

Since [formula], the second term of right-hand side of [\eqref=homo-divide3] is dominated by [formula]. Note that

[formula]

Then, since [formula], the first term of right-hand side of [\eqref=homo-divide3] is dominated by

[formula]

Therefore, we showed that [formula] and hence showed [\eqref=0904-2]. [formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=theo2-1]

For the proof of [\eqref=Fourier], let us φ∈C2(∂Ω) and [formula]. Then, we have

[formula]

Hence, we get

[formula]

Since C2(∂Ω) is dense in Bsp(∂Ω), we get [\eqref=Fourier] for all φ∈Bsp(∂Ω).

For the proof [\eqref=solution], suppose that φ∈C2(∂Ω) and [formula], then, by [\eqref=Fourier],

[formula]

Since [formula] is isomorphism, we have

[formula]

Let φk∈C2(∂Ω) such that φk  →  φ in Bsp(∂Ω) and uk  =  Sφk. Then, we get

[formula]

Hence, since C2(∂Ω) is the dense subspace of Bsp(∂Ω), [\eqref=0929] holds for φ∈Bsp(∂Ω) and so we get [\eqref=solution] for all φ∈Bsp(∂Ω).

Proof of Theorem [\ref=theo2-1]. By the Corollary [\ref=coro1016], we get that S2α:Bt - 2α + 1p(∂Ω)  →  Btp(∂Ω),  0  <  t < 1,  1  <  p  <    ∞   are bijective.

To show the existence of solution, let g∈Btp(∂Ω). By the bijectivity of S2α:Bt - 2α  +  1p(∂Ω)  →  Btp(∂Ω), there is a φ∈Bt - 2α  +  1p(∂Ω) such that S2αφ  =  g. Let u  =  S2αφ defined by [\eqref=def-single-dual]. Then, by (2) of the Theorem [\ref=rem2], u is a weak solution of [\eqref=solution] and by the Theorem [\ref=theo0905], u satisfies the equation [\eqref=main_result]. Hence, we complete the proof of the Theorem [\ref=theo2-1]. [formula]
