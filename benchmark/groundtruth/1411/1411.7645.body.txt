Imaginaries in bounded pseudo real closed fields

Introduction

A pseudo algebraically closed field (PAC field) is a field M such that every absolutely irreducible affine variety defined over M has an M-rational point. The concept of a PAC field was introduced by J.Ax in [\cite=Ax] and has been extensively studied. The above definition of PAC field has an equivalent model-theoretic version: M is existentially closed (in the language of rings) into each regular field extension of M.

A field M is called bounded if for any integer n, M has only finitely many extensions of degree n. Hrushovski showed in [\cite=Hrus] that if M is a bounded PAC field, and L is the language of rings expanded by enough constants, then ThL(M) eliminate imaginaries.

The notion of PAC field has been generalized by Basarab in [\cite=Ba0] and then by Prestel in [\cite=Pre] for ordered fields. Prestel calls a field M pseudo real closed field (PRC field) if M is existentially closed (in the language of rings) into each regular field extension L to which all orderings of M extend. Remark that if M is a PRC field and has no orderings, then M is a PAC field. PRC fields were extensively studied by L. van den Dries in [\cite=Van], A. Prestel in [\cite=Pre], M. Jarden in [\cite=J1], [\cite=J2], [\cite=J3], S. Basarab in [\cite=Ba] and [\cite=Ba1], and others.

The main result in this paper is a generalization to PRC bounded fields of elimination of imaginaries for PAC fields.

As corollary of the elimination of imaginaries and the fact that the algebraic closure in the sense of model theory defines a pregeometry we obtain (Theorem [\ref=PRCrosy]) that the complete theory of a bounded PRC field is superrosy of [formula] -rank 1.

The organization of the paper is as follows: In section [\ref=PRCpreliminaires] we give the required preliminaries on pseudo real closed fields and we fix a complete theory T of a bounded PRC field, where we enrich the language adding constants for an elementary submodel. In section [\ref=VOn] for n  ≥  1, we define the theory VOn in a multi-sorted language L*n. To each model of the theory T we associate a model of VOn (Remark [\ref=PRCOVn]). This result is an important tool in the proof of elimination of imaginaries for bounded PRC fields. We show quantifier elimination and elimination of imaginaries for the theory VOn. Finally in section [\ref=EIsecPRC] we prove the elimination of imaginaries for bounded PRC fields (Theorem [\ref=EIPRC]).

Pseudo real closed fields

In this section we give the required preliminaries in pseudo real closed fields.

Let M,N be fields such that M  ⊆  N.

The extension N / M is called totally real if each order on M extends to some order on N.

We say that N is a regular extension of M if [formula].

[\cite=Pre] For a field M the following are equivalent:

M is existentially closed (relative to [formula]) in every totally real regular extension N of M.

For every absolutely irreducible variety V defined over M, if V has a simple [formula]rational point for every real closure [formula] of M, then V has an M-rational point.

A field M that satisfies the conditions of Fact [\ref=PRC] is pseudo real closed (PRC). By [\cite=Pre] we can axiomatize the class of PRC fields in [formula]. Remark that the class of PRC fields contains the class of PAC fields and the class of real closed fields (RCF fields).

In the case when M admits only a finite number of orderings this already implies that M is existentially closed in N even in the language augmented by predicates for each order <   of M [\cite=Pre].

[\cite=J2] Let M be a PRC field. Then:

If <   is an order on M, then M is <  -dense in [formula], where [formula] is the real closure of M with respect to the order <  .

If <  i and <  j are different orders on M, then <  i and <  j induce different topologies.

Bounded pseudo real closed fields

[\cite=Mon] Let [formula] be a model of T.

For all [formula] the order <  i is [formula]-definable in the language L, and ThL(M) is model complete.

If A is a subfield of M containing K0, then [formula].

The theory V On

Fix [formula], n  ≥  1. Let L*n be the (n + 1)-sorted language consisting of n + 1 sorts [formula], n binary relation symbols [formula], with <  i on the sort Ri, a constant symbol 0 of sort R0, and 2n function symbols [formula], where fi:R0  →  Ri and gi:Ri  →  R0. Let V On be the L*n-theory axiomatized by:

<  i defines a dense linear order without endpoints on Ri, for [formula],

fi:R0  →  Ri is an injective function, for [formula],

[formula]

fi(R0) is <  i-dense and <  i-co-dense in Ri, for [formula],

If ai,bi∈Ri are such that ai  <  ibi, then there exists x0∈R0 such that ai  <  ifi(x0)  <  ibi, for all [formula].

Notation:

If [formula] and ai  <  ibi, denote by (ai,bi)i: = {x∈Ri:ai  <  ix < ibi} and by f- 1i(ai,bi)i: = {x∈R0:fi(x)∈(ai,bi)i}.

If M is a model of VOn and A  ⊆  M, denote by 〈A〉 the L*n-substructure generated by A.

If M is a model of T (see [\ref=PRCB]), we associate to M a model of V On as follows: For each [formula] we let M(i) be a real closure of M for the order <  i. We define R0 = M, Ri = M(i) with its natural order <  i, fi:M  →  M(i) the natural inclusion and gi its "inverse". Axioms 1,2 and 3 are clearly true. Axiom 5 is true by the Approximation Theorem ([\ref=ApTh]) and Fact [\ref=PRCcaracte]. For axiom 4, by Fact [\ref=PRCcaracte](1), M is <  i-dense in M(i). To see that M is co-dense in M(i), suppose by contradiction that there exists an <  i-interval I such that I  ⊆  M. Let [formula] and define the <  i-interval J: = {x  +  α:x∈I}. Then [formula], which contradicts M being dense in M(i).

Observe that if [formula] and [formula], then in the corresponding model of V On, the set I is L*n-definable by the formula [formula].

The theory V On is [formula]-categorical, has quantifier elimination in L*n and if M is a model of V On and A  ⊆  M, then [formula].

Let [formula] and [formula] be countable models of V On. Let I(M,N) be the family of partial isomorphisms with finite domain of M to N. Let g∈I(M,N), A  =  dom(g) and B = g(A). Let [formula]; we need to find c∈M such that if [formula] is defined by |A  =  g and (b) = c, then ∈I(M,N).

As g extends uniquely to an isomorphism from 〈A〉 to 〈B〉, we can suppose that A  =  〈A〉 and B = 〈B〉.

Case 1: b∈M0.

Observe that [formula]. For each [formula], let Ii be the smallest open <  i-interval containing fi(b) with extremities in [formula]. Let Ji  ⊆  Ni be the interval obtained by applying g to the extremities of Ii. By axiom 5 there exists c∈N0 such that fi(c)∈Ji for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  n; define g(b) = c.

Case 2: There exists i > 0 such that b∈Mi.

There exists a smallest open <  i-interval Ii with extremities in [formula], such that b∈Ii. Let Ji  ⊆  Ni be the interval obtained by applying g to the extremities of Ii. We have two possibilities:

b∈fi(M0): apply Case 1 to g- 1i(b) = b', observe that [formula].

[formula]: as fi(N0) is <  i- co-dense in Ni, there is [formula]. Define g(b) = c. Then [formula].

This shows quantifier elimination and [formula]-categoricity. The assertion about the algebraic and definable closures is clear.

Let [formula] be a model of V On.

A set of the form [formula], with Ii a non-empty <  i-open interval in Mi is called a multi-interval. Observe that if a multi-interval [formula] is definable over A, then by quantifier elimination (Theorem [\ref=EQVOn]) each Ii has its extremities in [formula]. We call the set of extremities of the multi-interval I the set of extremities of Ii, for all [formula].

Let E  ⊆  M0. We say that E is multi-open if for each e∈E, there exists a multi-interval I such that e∈I and I  ⊆  E.

Let E  ⊆  M0 and e∈E. Let [formula] be a multi-interval such that e∈I and I  ⊆  E. We say that I is the maximal multi-interval in E containing e if for all [formula], Im is the maximal <  m-interval with the property that:

fm(e)∈Im,

There are [formula] intervals in [formula] respectively, such that:

fj(e)∈Jj, for all m + 1  ≤  j  ≤  n,

[formula].

Observe that if [formula] and [formula] are maximal multi-intervals in E containing e, then for all [formula], Xi(e) = Yi(e): It is clear using maximality that X1(e) = Y1(e); by induction suppose that [formula], using maximality again we obtain that Xm + 1(e) = Ym + 1(e).

Let [formula] be a model of V On and A  ⊆  M finite. Let E  ⊆  M0 be multi-open L*n(A)-definable, and let e∈E. Then there exists a maximal multi-interval X(e) in E containing e and its extremities are in [formula].

Let Y1(e) be the set of open <  1-intervals J1 satisfying:

f1(e)∈J1.

There exist [formula] open intervals in [formula] respectively such that:

fj(e)∈Jj, for all 2  ≤  j  ≤  n,

[formula]

Observe that if J1,L1∈Y1(e) then [formula].

Since e∈E and E is multi-open, using axiom 5 we can find e1,e2∈M0, such that for all i  ≤  n, fi(e1) < ifi(e2), and [formula] Then (f1(e1),f1(e2))1∈Y1(e). Define [formula].

Observe that X1(e,e1,e2) is definable, (f1(e1),f1(e2))1  ⊆  X1(e,e1,e2) and that it is connected for the <  1-topology: if x,y∈X1(e,e1,e2) and x  <  1y then (x,y)1  ⊆  X1(e,e1,e2). This implies by quantifier elimination (Theorem [\ref=EQVOn]) that X1(e,e1,e2) is an <  1-interval, so that X1(e,e1,e2)∈Y1(e).

Since X1(e,e1,e2) is definable with parameters in [formula], its extremities are in [formula]. So by Theorem [\ref=EQVOn], its extremities are in [formula] As f1(e)∈(f1(e1),f1(e2))1  ⊆  X1(e,e1,e2), it cannot be one of the extremities. Thus X1(e,e1,e2) has its extremities in [formula].

Let e'1,e'2∈M0 be such that [formula] for all i  ≤  n, and [formula] Then X1(e,e1,e2)  ⊆  X1(e,e1',e2'). As before we obtain that X1(e,e1',e2') is an <  1-open interval with extremities in [formula] and that X1(e,e1',e2')∈Y1(e). But as f1(e'1),f1(e'2)∈(f1(e1),f1(e2))1  ⊆  X1(e,e1,e2)  ⊆  X1(e,e1',e2'), then f1(e'1),f1(e'2) cannot be the extremities of X1(e,e1',e2'). This implies that X1(e,e1',e2') has its extremities in [formula].

We have shown that if e'1,e'2∈M0 are such that [formula], then X(e,e1',e2') is L*n(A)-definable and that as the multi-intervals (e1',e2')i decrease, the sets X1(e,e1,e2) increase. By [formula]-categoricity and the fact that 〈A〉 is finite, the sets X1(e,e1',e2') stabilize for some value of e1',e2' and so Y1(e) has a maximal element X1(e), which has its extremities in [formula].

By induction suppose that we have already defined [formula], for l  ≤  n, with [formula] the maximal element of [formula] respectively.

Let Yl(e) be the set of <  l-intervals Jl satisfying:

fl(e)∈Jl,

There exist [formula] intervals in [formula] respectively such that:

fj(e)∈Jj, for all l + 1  ≤  j  ≤  n,

[formula].

Reasoning exactly as for l = 1, and defining

[formula]

we find that Yl(e) has a maximal element Xl(e), which is L*n(A)-definable.

Let [formula]. Then X(e) is the maximal multi-interval in E containing e, and it is L*n(A)-definable.

Let [formula] be a model of V On and A  ⊆  M finite. Let E  ⊆  M0 be L*n(A)-definable. Then there exists a unique canonical decomposition of E and its extremities are in [formula].

Define [formula] and [formula]. Observe that [formula] and E0 are L*n(A)-definable, that [formula] is multi-open and that [formula]. Using quantifier elimination (Theorem [\ref=EQVOn]) and the fact that the negation of an atomic formula is a disjunction of atomic formulas we obtain that E0 is a finite set, defined by disjunctions of equalities.

As [formula] is multi-open, by Lemma [\ref=maxinter] for each [formula] there exists [formula], the maximal multi-interval in [formula] containing e, and its extremities are in [formula].

Since 〈A〉 is finite then [formula] is finite. Let [formula] be finite such that [formula]. Then [formula].

Therefore [formula] is a canonical decomposition of E and its extremities are in [formula]. The uniqueness is clear by Remark [\ref=unicitycd].

The uniqueness in Theorem [\ref=candescom] implies that if E  ⊆  M0 is definable with parameters in 〈A〉 and also with parameters in 〈B〉, then the canonical decomposition of E is definable with parameters in [formula].

V On has elimination of imaginaries in the language L*n.

Let [formula] be a model of V On.

V On has unary elimination of imaginaries:

Let A  ⊆  M be finite and let E be an L*n(A)-definable set. We have two cases:

Case 1: E  ⊆  M0.

By Theorem [\ref=candescom] there exists a canonical decomposition of E. Let [formula] be the set of finite points and extremities of the multi-intervals in the canonical decomposition of E. By Remark [\ref=remdescomcan], [formula] is the code of the set E.

Case 2: E  ⊆  Mi for some i > 0.

Define [formula], [formula]. Observe that E1 and E2 are L*n(A)-definable and that E is the disjoint union of E1 and E2. Since gi(E1)  ⊆  M0, by Case 1 gi(E1) is coded by some tuple c1∈〈A〉.

By quantifier elimination (Theorem [\ref=EQVOn]), E2 is defined by a boolean combination of formulas of the form: a < ix, a = x, b  <  jfjgi(x), b  =  fjgi(x) with [formula], [formula]. Since [formula], then fj(gi(x)) = fj(0) for all x∈E2. This implies that E2 is defined by a formula [formula], where ψ(x) is a finite union of points and disjoint intervals with extremities in [formula]. Then the set c2 of finite points and extremities of these intervals is the code of the set E2, and c: = (c1,c2) is the code of E.

By Remark 3.2.2 of [\cite=HHM] it is enough to show that every definable unary function (with parameters) is encoded in M. Let [formula] and h:Mi  →  Mj be an L*n(A)-definable function with A  ⊆  M finite.

Let B: = {x:h(x)∈〈x〉}. Observe that [formula] is finite: Let [formula]; since h is L*n(A)-definable, then [formula]. Since [formula] then [formula], and [formula]. As 〈A〉 is finite, [formula] is finite.

Let [formula] and [formula] be such that [formula]. Let Xl: = {x∈Mi:h(x) = al}; by unary elimination the set Xl is coded in M by a tuple [formula].

The function h|B is also coded in M: Let X0: = {x∈Mi:h(x)∈〈0〉}  ⊆  B; by unary elimination the set X0 is coded in M by a tuple [formula]. If [formula], then

[formula]

Let [formula]. Then d is the code in M of h.

Elimination of Imaginaries in bounded PRC fields

Let [formula] be a model of T (see [\ref=PRCB]). Denote by M(i) a fixed real closure of M with respect to <  i.

A subset of M of the form [formula] with Ii a non-empty <  i-open interval in M(i) is called a multi-interval. Observe that by [\ref=ApTh] (Approximation Theorem) and Fact [\ref=PRCcaracte] (1) every multi-interval is non empty.

A definable subset S of M is called multi-open if for each x∈S, there exist a multi-interval I such that x∈I and I  ⊆  M.

A definable subset S of a multi-interval [formula] is called multi-dense in I if for any multi-interval J  ⊆  I, [formula] Note that multi-density implies <  i- density in Ii, for all [formula].

Let [formula] be a model of T. Let [formula] and [formula] such that a∈aclM(i)(c), with c a tuple in M. Then A = {x∈M:x  <  ia} is definable in M by a quantifier-free L(i)(c)-formula.

By quantifier elimination of the theory of real closed fields (RCF) and the fact that aclM(i)  =  dclM(i), we can find a quantifier-free L(i)-formula φ(x,c), such that [formula]. Then x∈A if and only if [formula].

[\cite=Mon] Let [formula] be a model of T and A  ⊆  M. Let S  ⊆  M be an Ln(A)-definable set. Then there are a finite set S0  ⊆  S, [formula] and [formula], with [formula] a multi-interval for all [formula] such that:

[formula]

{x∈Ij:x∈S} is multi-dense in Ij for all 1  ≤  j  ≤  m,

Iij  ⊆  M(i) has its extremities in [formula] for all 1  ≤  j  ≤  m and 1  ≤  i  ≤  n,

the set [formula] is definable in M by a quantifier-free L(i)(A)-formula, for all 1  ≤  j  ≤  m and 1  ≤  i  ≤  n.

Let [formula] be a model of T and A,B  ⊆  M. Let S  ⊆  M, Ln-definable with parameters in A and also in B. Then there are a finite set S0  ⊆  S, [formula] and [formula], with [formula] a multi-interval such that:

[formula],

{x∈Ij:x∈S} is multi-dense in Ij, for all 1  ≤  j  ≤  m,

the set [formula] is definable in M by a quantifier-free L(i)-formula with parameters in [formula].

Define [formula]. Since S is Ln(A)-definable and also Ln(B)-definable, then [formula] is Ln(A)-definable and also Ln(B)-definable.

By Fact [\ref=descomposition] there exists a finite set S0  ⊆  S such that [formula]. As [formula] is multi-open and Ln(A)-definable, using Fact [\ref=descomposition] there exists [formula] and multi-intervals [formula], for all 1  ≤  j  ≤  r1 such that: [formula], and for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  n, 1  ≤  j  ≤  r1, Iij has its extremities in [formula].

Similarly, as [formula] is also Ln(B)-definable, there exists [formula] and multi-intervals [formula] for all 1  ≤  j  ≤  r2 such that: [formula], and for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  n, 1  ≤  j  ≤  r2, Jij has its extremities in [formula].

Let [formula] be the set of extremities of Iij, for 1  ≤  i  ≤  n and 1  ≤  j  ≤  r1, and let [formula] be the set of extremities of Jij, for 1  ≤  i  ≤  n and 1  ≤  j  ≤  r2.

Consider the L*n-structure [formula] associated to M (see Remark [\ref=PRCOVn]). Observe that [formula] is [formula]-definable and also [formula]-definable in [formula]. Then by Theorem [\ref=candescom] and Remark [\ref=remdescomcan] there exists a unique canonical decomposition of [formula] and it is L*n-definable with parameters in [formula].

Let [formula] and [formula] the multi-intervals such that [formula] is the canonical decomposition of [formula]. If [formula], by Remark [\ref=definM] and the definition of [formula] and [formula], [formula] is definable in M by a quantifier-free L(i)-formula with parameters in [formula].

Let M be a model of T and e∈Meq. Let a be a tuple in M and f an [formula]-definable function such that f(a) = e. Let [formula]. Then there exist tuples b,b' in M, ACF-independent over E, such that [formula] and f(a) = f(b) = f(b').

The proof is exactly the same as in claim 1 of Proposition 3.1 in [\cite=Hrus]. If a∈E, it is clear. Assume [formula].

Sketch: Remember that by Fact [\ref=PRCacl] if A  ⊆  M, then [formula]. Using Neumann's Lemma we can find conjugates a1,a2 of a over [formula] satisfying:

[formula]

Take such a1,a2 with trdeg(a2 / Ea1) = m maximal satisfying [\eqref=eq1] below

[formula]

Take a3 ACF-independent of a2 over E(a1), such that [formula]. Then f(a3) = f(a2) = f(a1) = e and [formula].

Since a3 is ACF-independent of a2 over E(a1), then [formula]. Intersecting both sides with acl(E,a3) we obtain [formula] and then [formula].

Using the maximality of m, trdeg(a3 / Ea2)  ≤  m, and so a3 is ACF-independent of a2 over E(a1) and it is also ACF-independent of a1 over E(a2). Elimination of imaginaries in ACF and the fact that [formula] imply that a3 is ACF-independent of a1a2 over E. Let b  =  a1 and b' = a3.

Let M be a sufficiently saturated model of T, e∈Meq, a∈M and f an [formula]-definable function such that f(a) = e. Let [formula]. Suppose that e∉dcleq(E). Then there is a multi-interval [formula] such that a∈I and [formula] is multi-dense in I.

By Lemma [\ref=indimag] there exists b∈M, ACF-independent of a over E, such that [formula] and f(a) = f(b). For each formula [formula], define [formula]. Then Φα(M,a) = Φα(M,b): = Aα.

Since e∉dcleq(E), [formula] is not algebraic and [formula] is consistent. Take d∈M realizing [formula]. Then d∈Aα.

Since Aα is Ln(Ea)-definable and also Ln(Eb)-definable, by Proposition [\ref=descompositioncan] there exists a multi-interval [formula] such that:

d∈Jα

{x∈Jα:x∈Aα} is multi-dense in Jα.

[formula] is definable in M by a quantifier-free L(i)-formula with parameters in [formula].

So Jα is Ln(E)-definable in M. As [formula] and d∈Jα, then a∈Jα.

By saturation and Fact [\ref=PRCcaracte](1), there exists for all [formula] an <  i-interval Ii, with extremities in M such that [formula]. Then [formula] and [formula] is multi-dense in I, for all [formula]. This implies using saturation that [formula] is multi-dense in I.

[\cite=Mon] Let [formula] be a model of T. Let E  =  acl(E)  ⊆  M and a1,a2,d tuples of M such that: d is ACF-independent of {a1,a2} over E, [formula], and [formula]. Suppose that [formula].

Then there exists a tuple d* in some elementary extension M* of M such that:

d* is ACF-independent of {a1,a2} over E,

[formula]

[formula]

T has elimination of imaginaries.

Since we are working with a field it is enough to show that T has weak elimination of imaginaries. Let M be a monster model of T and e∈Meq. Define [formula]. We need to show that e∈dcleq(E). Let a be a tuple from M and let f be an [formula]-definable function such that f(a)  =  e. Suppose that [formula]

Suppose that [formula], [formula] and a  ⊆  acl(Ea1). Then aj∈acl(Ea1) = dcl(Ea1), for all [formula], and we can suppose that m = 1.

By Lemma [\ref=indimag] there exists b∈M, ACF-independent of a over E, such that [formula] and f(a) = f(b).

By Lemma [\ref=Imagdense] there is a multi-interval [formula] such that a∈I, and [formula] is multi-dense in I.

Let d realize [formula]. Then [formula], and [formula]. By Fact [\ref=IT2] we can find b* such that [formula] and [formula]. As f(b) = f(a) = e, then f(b*) = f(a) = e. But we have also that [formula]. This is a contradiction.

[\cite=EaOn] Any theory which has geometric elimination of imaginaries and for which algebraic closure defines a pregeometry is superrosy and [formula].

Let M be a PRC bounded field and let T = ThL(M) (see [\ref=PRCB]). Then T is superrosy and [formula]

By Fact [\ref=PRCacl], algebraic closure defines a pregeometry and by Theorem [\ref=EIPRC] T has elimination of imaginaries. Then by Fact [\ref=EIrosy] T is superrosy and [formula].
