Motivic stable homotopy and the stable 51 and 52 stems

Introduction

The problem of computing the stable homotopy groups of spheres is of fundamental importance in algebraic topology. Although this subject has been studied for a very long time, the Adams spectral sequence is still the best way to do stemwise computations at the prime 2.

Bruner produced a computer-generated table of d2 differentials in the Adams spectral sequence [\cite=Br3]. He started with his theorem on the interaction between Adams differentials and squaring operations [\cite=BMMS] to obtain several values of the d2 differential. Then he methodically exploited all (primary) multiplicative relations, both forwards and backwards, to deduce more and more values of the d2 differential. Through at least the 80-stem, this procedure gives the vast majority of the values of the d2 differential.

In Bruner's approach, the first unknown value is d2(D1), where D1 is a certain element in the 52-stem. This gives a precise sense to the claim that d2(D1) is "harder" than any previous d2 differential.

Mark Mahowald communicated (unpublished) the following argument for the presence of the differential d2(D1) = h20h3g2. First, there is an element x in the 37-stem that detects σθ4 [\cite=BMT]. Since h23x  =  h20h3g2, we deduce that h20h3g2 detects σ3θ4. Now σ3  =  νν4, so h20h3g2 detects νν4θ4. The final step is the claim that ν4θ4 is zero.

This final step turns out to be false; ν4θ4 is detected by h2h5d0 [\cite=DI1]. Mahowald's mistake arose from an incorrect understanding of the Toda bracket 〈θ4,2,σ2〉 [\cite=DI1].

In this note, we will repair the hole left by this mistake. The proof relies on motivic calculations in a fundamental way. In other words, our argument does not work if applied in the classical context. We will first establish a Massey product involving the element D1. Then we will apply the higher Leibniz rule on the interaction of Adams differentials with Massey products [\cite=Moss]. The second author discovered this proof based on motivic calculations by the first author. We adopt notation from [\cite=DI1] without further explanation. For charts of the classical and motivic Adams spectral sequences, see [\cite=DI2].

The higher Leibniz rule of Moss [\cite=Moss] is an appealing result that has not been as useful in practice as one might expect. In applications, indeterminacies often interfere. The differential that we establish here is an unusually clear application of the higher Leibniz rule. Our work suggests that an extension of Bruner's program to methodically exploit all 3-fold Massey products is likely to lead to further new results about Adams d2 differentials.

The origin of this note lies in the first author's analysis of the Adams spectral sequence through the 59-stem. The first author was able to give careful arguments for every Adams differential, with the sole exception of possible differentials on the element D1. The second author was instrumental in finishing the last remaining differential, whose argument we present here.

The chief consequence of our Adams differential calculation is the following results about the stable 51 and 52 stems.

The 2-primary order of the stable 51-stem is 128. As a group, the 2-primary stable 51-stem is either [formula] or [formula].

This follows immediately from the Adams E∞-page. The first [formula] lies in the image of J and has a generator that is detected by P6h2. The last [formula] is detected by h2B2.

The remaining elements are detected by h3g2, h0h3g2, and gn. These elements assemble into [formula] if there is a hidden 2 extension from h0h3g2 to gn, and they assemble into [formula] if there is no hidden 2 extension.

According to [\cite=Ko], there is no hidden 2 extension in the stable 51-stem. However, this claim is inconsistent with other claims in [\cite=Ko], as discussed in [\cite=DI1]. Because of this uncertainty, we leave this 2 extension unresolved.

The 2-primary stable 52-stem is equal to [formula].

This is immediate from the Adams E∞-page. According to [\cite=DI1], there are no possible hidden 2 extensions.

The differential

The crucial calculation is the following lemma which is due to Tangora [\cite=Tan].

In the classical Adams E2 page, we have a Massey product

[formula]

This Massey product is proven using the Lambda algebra. Since the elements D1 and G lie beyond the range of the published Curtis tables [\cite=CGMM], Tangora used another Massey product to deduce that the representative of D1 in the Lambda algebra has a leading term λ4λ7λ11λ15λ15. One can also use unpublished results of Mahowald and Tangora to see directly that G is represented by λ2λ4λ7λ11λ15λ15. Then the Massey product follows from d(λ2) = λ1λ0.

One cannot apply May's convergence theorem [\cite=May] directly to get this Massey product from the May differential d2(h2b22b40) = h0D1. The problem is that there is a "crossing" May differential d4(h1b23,1)  =  h1h3g2  +  h1h5g that voids the hypotheses of May's convergence theorem.

Bruner has verified this Massey product using computer data.

The classical calculation of Lemma [\ref=lem:G-bracket] allow us to deduce the analogous motivic calculation.

In the motivic Adams E2 page, we have a Massey product

[formula]

This is immediate from the fact that classical calculations can be recovered from motivic calculations by inverting τ [\cite=DI1].

In the motivic Adams spectral sequence, d2(D1) = h20h3g2.

Corollary [\ref=cor:G-bracket] gives us the Massey product τG = 〈h1,h0,D1〉 in the motivic Adams spectral sequence. Using the higher Leibniz rule of Moss [\cite=Moss], we have d2(τG) = 〈h1,h0,d2(D1)〉 since there is no indeterminacy. Since d2(τG) = h5c0d0 [\cite=DI1], we have 〈h1,h0,d2(D1)〉 = h5c0d0. In particular, this is nonzero. Then the only possibility is that d2(D1) = h20h3g2.

Note that h20h3g2 = h22h5d0, so

[formula]

as dictated by the higher Leibniz rule.

In the classical Adams spectral sequence, d2(D1) = h20h3g2.

This is immediate from the fact that classical calculations can be recovered from motivic calculations by inverting τ [\cite=DI1].

In the classical Adams spectral sequence, h5c0d0 and d2(G) are both zero. This means that our proof is strictly motivic in nature. We do not know a proof using only the classical Adams spectral sequence.

Using only classical information, we suggest a possible argument that D1 does not survive the classical Adams spectral sequence. Start with the Massey product G = 〈h1,h0,D1〉 and the classical differential on d3(G)  =  Ph5d0. Moss's convergence theorem [\cite=Moss] then implies that 〈η,2,{D1}〉 is not a well-formed Toda bracket. The only possibility is that D1 does not survive. However, that still leaves two possible differentials: d2(D1)  =  h20h3g2, or d4(D1)  =  gn. We do not know how to rule out the second alternative using only the classical Adams spectral sequence.

Mahowald's original argument for the differential d2(D1) used a faulty computation of the Toda bracket 〈θ4,2,σ2〉. Partial information about this Toda bracket is used in the construction of a Kervaire invariant element θ5 in dimension 62 [\cite=BJM]. Our improved understanding of the Toda bracket does not contradict any of the claims of [\cite=BJM].
