Representations for generalized Drazin inverse of operator matrices over a Banach space

introduction

The concept of the generalized Drazin inverse (GD-inverse) in a Banach algebra was introduced by Koliha [\cite=Koliha1996]. Let B be a complex unital Banach algebra. An element a of B is generalized Drazin invertible in case there is an element b∈B satisfying Such b, if it exists, is unique; it is called a generalized Drazin inverse of a, and will be denoted by ad. Then the spectral idempotent aπ of a corresponding to 0 is given by aπ = 1 - aad.

The GD-inverse was extensively investigated for matrices over complex Banach algebras and matrices of bounded linear operators over complex Banach spaces. The GD-inverse of the operator matrix has various applications in singular differential equations and singular difference equations, Markov chains and iterative methods and so on (see [\cite=Ben2006] [\cite=Campbell1980I] [\cite=Campbell1980II] [\cite=Campbell1983] [\cite=Castro2006] [\cite=Castro2002] [\cite=Djordjev2001] [\cite=Du2005] [\cite=Wei2005] [\cite=Wei2006(1)] [\cite=Wei2006(2)]).

The generalized Drazin inverse is a generalization of Drazin inverses and group inverses. The study on representations for the Drazin inverse of block matrices essentially originated from finding the general expressions for the solutions to singular systems of differential equations [\cite=Campbell1983] [\cite=Campbell1991] [\cite=Campbell1976]. Until now, there have been many formulae for the Drazin inverse of general [formula] block matrices under some restrictive assumptions (see [\cite=Cvetkov2008] [\cite=Djordjev2001] [\cite=Dopazo2010] [\cite=guophd] [\cite=Guo2010] [\cite=Hartwig1977] [\cite=Hartwig2006] [\cite=Liu2012] [\cite=Meyer1997]).

Some results of the Drazin inverse have been developed in the GD-inverse of operator matrices over Banach spaces (see [\cite=Castro2009] [\cite=CvetkovAS2011] [\cite=Deng2010] [\cite=Djordjev2001] [\cite=guophd]). Assume that both X and Y are complex Banach spaces. Denote by B(X,Y) the set of all bounded linear operators from X to Y, and write B(X,X) = B(X). Let an operator matrix [formula] where A∈B(X),D∈B(Y),B∈B(Y,X),C∈B(X,Y).

Castro-González [\cite=Castro2009] derived explicit expressions of the GD-inverse of M under certain conditions, which extended some results of [\cite=Deng2010] [\cite=Djordjev2001]. Cvetkovi [\cite=CvetkovAS2011] also extended some results of [\cite=Deng2010] [\cite=Djordjev2001]. Recently, Mosi [\cite=Mosic2014] gave the new formulae for the GD-inverse of 2  ×  2 matrices in a Banach algebra.

In this paper, we derive new formulae for the GD-inverse of a (2,2,0) operator matrix N under certain circumstances. Furthermore, we apply Nd to give representations of Md under weaker restrictions, which generalizes and unifies several results of [\cite=Castro2009] [\cite=CvetkovAS2011] [\cite=Deng2010] [\cite=Djordjev2001] [\cite=guophd] [\cite=Mosic2014].

Since (ad)n = (an)d for any a∈B we adopt the convention that adn = (ad)n and a0 = 1 and [formula] in case k < 0. Moreover, we define [formula] for a,b,c,d∈B.

Generalized Drazin inverse of a (2,2,0) operator matrix

Let B be a complex unital Banach algebra. An element a∈B is called quasinilpotent, if [formula] Let M2(B) be the [formula] matrix algebra over B. Given an idempotent e in B, we consider the set [formula]. Then M2(B,e) is a unital Banach algebra with respect to the norm

[formula]

Let e be an idempotent of B. For any a∈B let

[formula]

Then the mapping σ is an isometric Banach algebra isomorphism from B to M2(B,e) such that

(σ(a))d  =  σ(ad);

if [formula], then ad  =  α  +  β  +  γ  +  δ.

By [\cite=Castro2004] we have the mapping σ is an isometric Banach algebra isomorphism from B to M2(B,e). The rest of the proof is obvious.

([\cite=Djordjev2001]) Let [formula] and let [formula]   for a,b,d∈B. Then

[formula]

where

Let e be an idempotent of B and let a∈B be generalized Drazin invertible such that ea(1 - e) = 0. Then ea and a(1 - e) are both generalized Drazin invertible, and

[formula]

for any positive integer n.

Since ea(1 - e) = 0, combining Lemma [\ref=lempierce] and Lemma [\ref=triangle], we have ead(1 - e) = 0. Then eaead = eaad = eadea eadeaead = ead. Furthermore,

[formula]

Hence ea is generalized Drazin invertible and (ea)d = ead. Similarly we can prove that a(1 - e) is generalized Drazin invertible and (a(1 - e))d  =  ad(1 - e). Using ea(1 - e) = 0 we get easily (ea)n = ean for any positive integer n.

([\cite=cline2014])(Cline's Formula) For a,b∈B, ab is generalized Drazin invertible if and only if so is ba. Furthermore, if ab is generalized Drazin invertible, then

[formula]

The following lemma is an immediate corollary of [\cite=guophd].

Let [formula] with a and d generalized Drazin invertible. If abc = 0, ~ bd = 0, ~ (bc)d = 0, then x is generalized Drazin invertible, and

[formula]

where

Now we can give our first main result. Recall that adn = (ad)n and [formula] for a,b,c,d∈B.

Let [formula] be an operator matrix with E and F generalized Drazin invertible. If FdEFπ = 0 and FπFE = 0, then N is generalized Drazin invertible, and

[formula]

We adopt the convention that Fe = FFd. Let [formula], σ as in Lemma [\ref=lempierce], and [formula]. Since FdEFπ = 0, we have Note that a has the group inverse

[formula]

and so aaπ = 0. Using Lemma [\ref=(abpi)d=adbpi] we have (EFπ)d = EdFπ, and

[formula]

for any positive integer n. Hence

[formula]

Note that (FπF)d = 0, and so

[formula]

Using Lemma [\ref=triangle] we get (bc)d = (cb)d = 0. Since FdEi + 1Fπ = Fd(EFπ)i + 1 = 0 for any nonnegative integer i, we have By Lemma [\ref=guo3.3.7cor] we have

[formula]

where Substituting [\eqref=eqa3], [\eqref=d^d] and [\eqref=eqa2] into [\eqref=eqa4] and using Lemma [\ref=lempierce] will give the expression of Nd that we wanted.

Let [formula] be an operator matrix with E and F generalized Drazin invertible. If FdEFπ = 0 and FπFE = 0, then N is generalized Drazin invertible, and

[formula]

for any positive integer n.

Let Nd = P + Q + R by Theorem [\ref=th220babpi=0], where

[formula]

Since FdEi + 1Fπ = Fd(EFπ)i + 1 = 0 for any nonnegative integer i, and since FπFE = 0 we have P2 = 0, RP = 0, RQ = 0, PQ = QP = 0, and

[formula]

for any positive integer n. Then [formula], by a routine computation, we get the expression of Ndn as shown in Corollary [\ref=corNdn].

The following theorem, which is a dual version of Theorem [\ref=th220babpi=0], can be proved similarly.

Let [formula] be an operator matrix with E and F generalized Drazin invertible. If FπEFd = 0 and EFFπ = 0, then N is generalized Drazin invertible, and

[formula]

such that

[formula]

and

[formula]

We adopt the convention that Fe = FFd. Let [formula]. Using Lemma [\ref=(abpi)d=adbpi] we have (EFπ)d = EdFπ. The proof is similar in spirit to that of Theorem [\ref=th220babpi=0]. Since FπEFd = 0, we have Then

[formula]

Since FπEi + 1Fd = (FπE)i + 1Fd = 0 for any nonnegative integer i, we have

[formula]

Combining [\eqref=eqb1] and [\eqref=eqb2], in a way exactly similar to Theorem [\ref=th220babpi=0], we get the result.

Applications to a [formula] operator matrix

[\cite=guophd] Let [formula] with a and d generalized Drazin invertible. If cad = 0 and caib = 0 for any nonnegative integer i, then x is generalized Drazin invertible, and where

Now, based on an observation on the matrix decomposition, we apply the representations of generalized Drazin inverse of the (2,2,0) operator matrix to give our another main result. Recall that ae = ada, adn = (ad)n and [formula] for a,b,c,d∈B.

Let [formula] be an operator matrix with A and D generalized Drazin invertible. If (BC)dA(BC)π = 0, (BC)πBCA = 0, BDd = 0, and BDiC = 0 for any positive integer i, then M is generalized Drazin invertible, and

[formula]

where

[formula]

for [formula] and [formula]

Note that

[formula]

Let us denote by P and Q the left matrix and the right matrix of the right hand side in [\eqref=equ=pq], respectively. Then [formula], where

[formula]

Applying Corollary [\ref=corNdn] to Δ we obtain the expression of Δdn for any [formula] as shown in Theorem [\ref=BDd=0] [\ref=FEFpi=0]. Since BDd = 0 and BDiC = 0 for [formula], we have

[formula]

Moreover, [formula] for [formula]. Substitute [\eqref=eqd1], [\eqref=eqd2] and Δdn into Lemma [\ref=guoth3.2.2] to obtain (QP)d. By Lemma [\ref=cline] Md  =  P(QP)2dQ and a routine computation we get the expression of Md as shown in Theorem [\ref=BDd=0] [\ref=FEFpi=0].

We now analyse some special cases of the preceding theorem, some of which give results of [\cite=Castro2009] [\cite=Deng2010] [\cite=Djordjev2001] [\cite=guophd] [\cite=Mosic2014].

Let [formula] be an operator matrix with A and D generalized Drazin invertible. If A(BC)π = 0, (BC)πBCA = 0, BD = 0, then M is generalized Drazin invertible, and

[formula]

where

[formula]

for [formula] and [formula]

The result can be deduced by routine computations.

The corollary above relaxes and removes Theorem 2.3 of [\cite=Mosic2014], in which Mosi consider the conditions BD = 0, A(BC)π = 0, C(BC)π = 0, and (BC)πB = 0.

In [\cite=Castro2009] [\cite=Deng2010] [\cite=Djordjev2001] [\cite=guophd], expressions of the GD-inverse of M are given under the following conditions

BC = 0,BD  =  0 and DC  =  0 (see [\cite=Djordjev2001]);

BC = 0,BD  =  0 (see [\cite=Deng2010]);

BCA = 0,BD = 0,DC = 0 (see [\cite=Castro2009]);

BCA = 0,BD = 0, and BC is nilpotent (see [\cite=Castro2009]);

BDd = 0, BDiC = 0 for i = 0,1,...,n - 1 (see [\cite=guophd]).

Theorem [\ref=BDd=0] [\ref=FEFpi=0] relaxes some conditions in each item of (1)-(5) and gives a unified generalization of [\cite=Djordjev2001], [\cite=Deng2010], [\cite=Castro2009], [\cite=Castro2009], and [\cite=guophd]

We conclude this paper with some remarks. Using a way similar to Theorem [\ref=BDd=0] [\ref=FEFpi=0] we can give an expression of the generalized Drazin inverse Md under the following condition

[formula]

which gives a unified generalization of [\cite=Djordjev2001], [\cite=Deng2010], [\cite=CvetkovAS2011], [\cite=guophd] and [\cite=Mosic2014].

Moreover, by using [\cite=guophd] instead of Lemma [\ref=guoth3.2.2] and by using the similar argument we can give expressions of the generalized Drazin inverse Md under the following conditions, respectively,

(BC)dA(BC)π = 0, (BC)πBCA = 0, DdC = 0, and [formula];

(BC)πA(BC)d = 0, ABC(BC)π = 0, DdC = 0, and [formula].

which give a unified generalization of [\cite=Djordjev2001], [\cite=Deng2010], [\cite=Castro2009], [\cite=guophd], [\cite=Mosic2014], and [\cite=CvetkovAS2011].
