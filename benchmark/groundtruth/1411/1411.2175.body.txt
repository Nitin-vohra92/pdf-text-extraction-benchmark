Topological Node-Line Semimetal in Three Dimensional Graphene Networks

introduction

Carbon is one of the most fascinating elements in nature, which can form many different crystal structures with diverse electronic properties, such as C60, [\cite=C60] nanotube, [\cite=nanotube] graphene, [\cite=Graphene-scotch] graphite, and diamond. Among them, graphene is one of the most amazing materials, which supports Dirac point in its low energy electronic structure, described as [formula], where v is velocity, [formula] is momentum and [formula] is Pauli matrix. This novel electronic state leads to many interesting phenomena, such as the unconventional quantum Hall effect, large magnetoresistance, and unusual optical properties, which make graphene potentially useful. [\cite=Graphene] The presence of 2D Dirac cone is fragile, and two conditions are required to protect it: (1) the absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC), and (2) the presence of inversion symmetry. The first condition is naturally satisfied in graphene, because its SOC strength is negligible (~  10- 3 meV). [\cite=Yao] If SOC in graphene is taken into account, it will open up a gap at Fermi level and lead to quantum spin Hall insulator (i.e., 2D topological insulator). [\cite=Kane] The second requirement is, however, very strong, and it is satisfied only in the presence of A-B sublattice symmetry, which can be easily broken, leading to a normal insulating state, similar to that in BN nanosheet.

As proposed by A. L. Mackay and H. Terrones, [\cite=mackay] graphene can be extended to three-dimensional (3D) space to form 3D networks by placing graphitic tiles consisting of 4- to 8-membered rings onto the Schwarz minimal surface. Hereafter, we call such 3D all carbon allotrope Mackay-Terrones crystal (MTC). Schwarz minimal surface is a 3D periodic minimal surface with its mean curvature H = (k1 + k2) / 2 being zero and Gaussian curvature (K = k1k2) being negative everywhere on it. Here k1 and k2 are the principal curvatures. There are various Schwarz minimal surfaces, such as primitive (P), diamond (D) and gyroid (G) surface. One type of MTC based on P-surface is shown in Fig. 1. Different from C60-like fullerene, which has positive Gaussian curvature, MTC has negative Gaussian curvature and is periodically connected. Such 3D network of sp2-bonded carbon has unique properties, such as high surface-to-volume ratio and remarkable porosity, which stimulate extensive studies. [\cite=view] [\cite=bio] Theoretically, MTC has been proved to be dynamically stable and require less formation energy than C60. [\cite=dft_mackay] [\cite=vanderbilt] Experimentally, saddle-like nano-carbon sheet, the main component of MTC, has been successfully synthesized. [\cite=saddle] Similar negatively curved sp2 networks has been observed in spongy carbon [\cite=spongy] and negative replica of zeolite. [\cite=zeolite] Recently, high-quality 3D nanoporous graphene fabricated by using nanoporous Ni as template shows very similar MTC structure, [\cite=chenlab1] [\cite=chenlab2] making synthesizing of it very promising. On the other hand, the topological properties of the band structure for these all-carbon MTC remain unexplored and will be the main subject of this paper. We will show that such all-carbon MTC can host non-trivial electronic states, including topological node-lines and 3D Dirac points, which are distinct from its 2D counter material graphene.

Results

We concentrate on the MTC formed with Schwarz minimal P-surface. As shown in Fig. 1, a stable structure with simple cubic lattice in Pmm space group, and 176 atoms per unit cell has been obtained by Tagami et al. in Ref. [\cite=ours] and labeled as 6-1-1-p. We have employed the software package OpenMX [\cite=openmx] for the first-principles calculation. It is based on norm-conserving pseudopotential and pseudo-atomic localized basis functions, which is highly efficient for the MTC with more than a hundred atoms. The choice of pseudopotentials, pseudo atomic orbital basis sets C6.0-s2p2d1 and the sampling of Brillouin zone with [formula]-grid have been carefully checked. After full structural relaxation, we get the lattice constant a=14.48 Å, and the diameters of the pipes or pores are around 9.876 Å[formula] and 5.629 Å, respectively, which are in good agreement with their results. [\cite=ours] The electronic band structure of this crystal, calculated based on the local density approximation (LDA), is shown in Fig. 1(d). We find that this crystal is a semimetal with band crossings around the Fermi level, similar to the massless Dirac cone in graphene, but they are in fact very different - the key issue of this paper.

Band structure

Detailed analysis of the band structure reveals that: (1) The occupied and unoccupied low energy bands are triply-degenerate at Γ, and have T1g and T2u symmetry, respectively. The formers are even while the laters are odd under spacial inversion symmetry. Moving from Γ to R point, their degeneracy recover again. However, their energy ordering exchanges, leading to the so called band inversion, which is one of the key ingredients for the topological insulators. [\cite=TIreview] [\cite=TIreview-2] Due to the band inversion, the band crossings happen along both X - R and R - M paths as seen from Fig. 1(d). (2) Including SOC in the calculation, a gap will open up around the band crossings, leading to a 3D strong topological insulator with Z2 index of (1;111) [\cite=Z2] by treating the lower half of the anti-crossing bands as occupied. However, similar to graphene, the SOC splitting is small (around 0.13 meV or 1.5 K), and can be neglected in cases with temperature higher than 1.5 K.

The low energy bands near the Fermi level are formed by the overlapping of the molecular orbitals with T1g and T2u symmetry. Since each isolated carbon cluster in the MTC has approximately spherical symmetry, these molecular orbitals can be viewed as the "atomic orbitals" with g and f-wave symmetry, which are further splitted under the cubic crystal field. Therefore, the T1g sector consists of gxy(x2 - y2), gyz(y2 - z2) and gzx(z2 - x2) orbitals, while the T2u sector contains fx(y2 - z2), fy(z2 - x2), and fz(x2 - y2) orbitals. Thus, these six hypothetical atomic orbitals are used as basis set to reproduce the low energy physics of this system. A Slater-Koster tight-binding (TB) Hamiltonian has been established and the on-site energy levels, as well as hopping parameters, can be obtained by fitting the band structure from the first-principles calculations. (see Appendix for details) The triply degenerated T1g and T2u bands at Γ have eigen energies of Eg + 4Vggp + 2Vggd and Ef - 4Vffd, respectively. Those at R are Eg - 4Vggp - 2Vggd and Ef + 4Vffd due to the nearest-neighbor hopping. Here, Eg and Ef are on-site energies for g and f orbitals. Vggp and Vggd are the hopping parameters among g orbitals. Vffp and Vffd are those for f-orbitals. From these analysis, we learn that the band inversion or the switching of g (T1g) and f (T2u) orbitals between Γ and R points is due to the strong energy dispersion (or the large hopping parameters). As shown in Fig. 2, this TB model can reproduce all the features of bands, including band topology, with the fitted Slater-Koster parameters (in unit eV) Eg=-0.12, Ef=0.19, Vffp=0.019, Vffd=-0.075, Vfgp=0.05, Vfgd=0.0, Vggp=-0.035, Vggd=-0.055. The mean square error is minimized to 0.0016 eV2 with sampling k-points along the high-symmetrical path shown in Fig. 1(d). Artificially reducing the hopping parameters (such as expanding the lattice parameter) by 50% will eliminate the band inversion, with T1g states lower than the T2u states at R point. This calculation also suggests that the strength of band inversion in the system is strong.

Topological Node-Lines and 3D Dirac Points

Interestingly, the band crossings in MTC lead to node-lines rather than node points. In other words, the band crossings exist along certain closed loops in the 3D momentum space, and generate three circular-like node-lines around the R point, as shown in Fig. 2. These node-lines are protected by two factors, one is the coexistence of time reversal (T) and spacial inversion (P) symmetry and the other factor is that the SOC is negligible.

With the coexistence of P and T symmetries, there exists a certain gauge choice under which the spineless Hamiltonian is completely real valued. (See Appendix for details) Now we will show that for this system, if there is an energy level-crossing of two bands at a momentum [formula], a stable node-line will unavoidably appear. Around the crossing point, the two-level 2×  2 Hamiltonian can be written in the following general form:

[formula]

where the Pauli matrices σi(i=x,y,z) denote the two-band space. Without loss of generality, [formula](i=0,x,y,z) are all real function of [formula]. The eigen energy of H being

[formula]

and the energy degeneracy can be obtained when the three conditions [formula]=0 (i=x,y,z) are satisfied with three parameters [formula] in the 3D momentum space. As mentioned above, the Hamiltonian can be chosen to be real valued leading to dy = 0. The rest [formula], [formula] and [formula] can be expanded around k0 and the location of the crossing points can be determined by [formula] and [formula], where [formula] and δi denote the small perturbative terms with both T and P symmetries. In the generic case, the above two equations give a line in the vicinity of k0 with its direction determined by [formula]. Therefore, the generic solution of the band crossing point in 3D k-space is a closed loop. Any external perturbations that keep T, P and translational symmetry can only shift or distort but not eliminate the nodal loops.

The topologically stable node-line in MTC is only protected by P and T and no other symmetry is required. The additional mirror symmetry in the present system only forces the node-lines to stay in kz (or kx,ky)=[formula] plane. The cubic symmetry leads to three in-plane node-lines, as what have been found from our calculations in Fig. 2. The node-lines are not necessarily to be flat in energy, and they can have energy dispersion in the k space determined by [formula] term (which breaks the particle-hole symmetry). Different from other proposals for the topological node-lines, [\cite=burkov] the appearance of node-lines in MTC is very stable and does not require fine tuning of any parameters. This mechanism to generate topological node-lines in three dimensional materials only requires T, P symmetry and weak enough SOC, which can be easily applied to a large class of materials consisting of mainly the light elements.

It is now clear that this 3D MTC is different with graphene in the sense that it is a semimetal with node-lines in the 3D momentum space with the presence of both T and P symmetries. The thing becomes even more interesting if P symmetry is further broken. In such a case, from above discussions, we will in general expect three conditions [formula] with three parameters for the band crossing points, leading to isolated points in the 3D k-space. This is nothing but the 3D Dirac metals discussed recently. [\cite=Na3Bi] [\cite=Cd3As2] [\cite=Na3Biexp] [\cite=Cd3As2exp] [\cite=Cd3As2expHasan] [\cite=Cd3As2expCava] On the other hand, comparing with other proposals for Dirac semimetals, the 3D Dirac point here is topologically stable and does not require the protection from any crystalline symmetry. Similar with the situation in graphene, finite SOC will open a gap at the Dirac point and makes the system a topological insulator. In fact, although our calculated structure has inversion symmetry, most of known real samples of MTC [\cite=chenlab1] [\cite=chenlab2] have strong defects and orientation disorder, which should break inversion symmetry. The plausible existence of these stable 3D Dirac points has been indicated by the density of states [\cite=chenlab1] and heat capacity measurements. [\cite=privatecommuniction] If T symmetry is further broken in the system, we will expect Weyl semimetal states, which has been extensively studied but not realized yet experimentally. [\cite=wan] [\cite=HgCrSe] [\cite=multilayerTRI] [\cite=multilayerTRB]

Fermi surface and surface flat band

The two crossing bands within the kz=[formula] plane obtained by TB Hamiltonian are plotted in Fig. 3. In general the crossing of bands do not happen at the same energy. They have energy dispersion around 25 meV. The alternative electron and hole pockets are formed when the band crossing is lower or higher than the Fermi level and this results in lotus-root like Fermi surface instead of dispersionless line.

This topologically stable node-line semimetal state can have nontrivial surface states. [\cite=Ryu_2002PRL] [\cite=JETP932011] [\cite=JETP942011] [\cite=2011arXiv1111.4627V] [\cite=burkov] For the (001)-surface, the three node-line rings are projected to be a ring and two orthogonal diameter segments inside of it as shown in Fig. 4(a). The (001)-surface state is calculated based on the six-band TB model using both Green's function method and slab-model method. [\cite=MRS_weng:9383312] There is a nearly flat surface band nestled inside of the projected node-line ring with its band width being about 40 meV due to the particle-hole asymmetry. The peak-like surface density of states contributed by this nearly flat band is clearly shown in Fig. 4(b), which is proposed to be an important route to high temperature surface superconductivity. [\cite=PhysRevB.83.220503] [\cite=2014arXiv1409.3944V] The layer-resolved weight of wave function for the surface flat band is shown in Fig. 4(c). It penetrates just three layers into bulk with most of the weight on the surface layer. The surface localization of these flat bands is well resolved for those separated from bulk bands. The nestled flat surface states have small dispersion and their eigen energy distribution in surface BZ is shown in Fig. 4(d), which looks like some vibrational mode of "drumhead". Such "drumhead"-like states are readily to be detected by angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy or scanning tunnel microscope.

The topological node-line state, as well as its surface flat band, can be understood by studying an effective 2×  2 toy model Hamiltonian. Taking dx=kz, dy=0 and dz=M - B(k2x + k2y + k2z), the Hamiltonian gives a node-line determined by [formula] in the plane kz=0. Obviously [formula] is required. The topology of this effective continuum bulk hamiltonian has been analyzed [\cite=mong] (See Appendix for details) and found to have topologically protected (001) surface states with dispersionless zero eigen energy inside of the projected node-line circle given by [formula]. Here (k̄x, k̄y) denotes the k-point in (001) surface Brillouin zone. As mentioned above, [formula] determines the energy dispersion of the node-line, as well as the surface flat band, though the detailed dispersion of surface states are also influenced by the surface potential in practice. [\cite=MRS_weng:9383312]

Discussion

We find that 6-1-1-p is not the only MTC having such novel node-line semimetal state. The MTC with the structure labeled as 6-1-2-p [\cite=ours] also has such nontrivial topological state. (as shown Appendix) The differences are: (1) The band inversion happens at M point and the Z2 index is (1;000) when even weaker SOC splitting (about 0.03 meV compared with 0.136 meV in 6-1-1-p) is considered. (2) The low energy physics around Fermi level can be described by six atomic like molecular orbitals also, but they are T1u (px, py and pz) and T2g (dxy, dyz and dxz). The similar tight-binding model on simple cubic lattice can also reproduce all of its electronic structure. (3) There are also three mutually perpendicular line-node circles centering M point instead of R point. The similar surface state with nearly flat band can also be obtained. Therefore, it is most plausible that there are more 3D MTCs which can host such node-line semimetal state. Similar node-lines have also been found in optimally tuned photonic crystal composed of gyroid, [\cite=lufu] the Schwarz minimal G-surface. Other proposed carbon system include Bernal graphite [\cite=GP_Mikitik_2006PRB] [\cite=GP_Mikitik_2008LTP] and hyper-honeycomb lattice. [\cite=2014arXiv1408.5522M] A carbon gyroid [\cite=PhysRevB_Gsurf] is found to be metal with Dirac cone in conduction bands higher away from Fermi level. Node-line is also proposed in Dirac or Weyl superconductors. [\cite=FanZhang_2014PRL]

Conclusion

In summary, based on the first-principles calculations, we have predicted that a family of all-carbon 3D allotrope, Mackay-Terrones crystals, can have nontrivial topological node-line semimetal state, which is protected by both time-reversal symmetry and inversion symmetry after band inversion. When such bulk node-line is projected onto surface to form a circle, there is flat bands nestled inside of it. Such "drumhead"-like state is an ideal playground for many interaction induced nontrivial states, such as superconductivity and fractional topological insulator states. Further, if the inversion symmetry is broken, the node-lines will evolve into stable 3D Dirac points. Two examples of such MTC with stable structure have been discussed. These predications can most probably be directly observed in further experiments.

Tight-binding Model

6-1-1-p case

The hypothetic atomic orbital basis set is arranged in the order of gxy(x2 - y2), gyz(y2 - z2), gzx(z2 - x2), fx(y2 - z2), fy(z2 - x2) and fz(x2 - y2). Those from g (f) orbitals are triple-degenerate and the on-site energy is set as Eg (Ef). Since the cubic symmetry, only gxy(x2 - y2) orbital is plotted in the xy plane in Figure S1. The fx(y2 - z2) is plotted as two parts fxy2 and - fxz2, perpendicular to each other. Arranging these orbitals on a simple cubic lattice with lattice constant a, the Slater-Koster parameters for nearest-neighbor hopping is defined in the following. The nearest hopping between gxy(x2 - y2) in x and y direction is Vggp, while that in z direction is Vggd. The hopping between fxy2 (- fxz2) along x and y (x and z) is Vffp, and that along z (y) direction is Vffd. The hopping between nearest neighboring gxy(x2 - y2) and fxy2 (- fxz2) along y direction is Vfgp (Vfgd), while those along x and z direction are zero. We list some of the nonzero elements of final tight-binding hamiltonian and others can be easily derived by using the cubic cyclic symmetry.

[formula]

Here [formula], [formula] and [formula] are the nearest neighbor site along positive x, y and z direction, respectively. We have fitted all the Slater-Koster parameters and find that Eg=-0.12, Ef=0.19, Vffp=0.019, Vffd=-0.075, Vfgp=0.05, Vfgd=0.0, Vggp=-0.035, Vggd=-0.055 (all in unit eV) can well reproduce the band structure from first-principles calculation as shown in Fig. 2 of main text.

However, the following set of parameters will modify the band structure by shifting the band crossing from R-M to Γ-M. The band structure with Eg=-0.10, Ef=0.16, Vffp=-0.010, Vffd=-0.080, Vfgp=0.05, Vfgd=0.0, Vggp=-0.055, Vggd=-0.035 is shown in Figure S2. Compared with that in realistic case, there is additional band inversion at M. This changes the Z2 index to be (0;111) if the tiny SOC is considered.

6-1-2-p case

For 6-1-2-p case, the band structure from first-principles calculation is shown in Figure S3. Obviously, there are band inversion around M point. Careful analysis has shown that the occupied and unoccupied triply degenerated bands at Γ (also at R point) are T1u and T2g, respectively. Therefore, we can take hypothetic px, py and pz orbitals as the basis for T1u representation in cubic symmetry and dxy, dyz and dzx form T2g. All the p orbitals have on-site energy Ep and d orbitals have Ed. The Slater-Koster parameters such as Vppσ, Vppπ, Vddπ, Vddδ and Vpdπ are defined as in common. [\cite=SKTB] Putting these orbitals on a simple cubic lattice, we can have the tight-binding Hamiltonian and some of the nonzero elements are listed as following:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

The other elements can be obtained by using cubic cyclic symmetry. The fitted parameters which can well reproduce the band structure from first-principles calculation are Ep=-0.10147, Ed=0.28281, Vppσ=0.02005, Vppπ=-0.017848, Vpdπ=0.034711, Vddπ=0.04694, Vddδ=-0.062523. The mean square error, around 0.0061 eV2, is estimated for the three conduction bands. Estimation for the valence bands has problem in selecting proper bands since there are more than three bands entangled. While the topology of bands from fitted model is the same as from first-principles calculation.

Real Valued Hamiltonian for Spinless System with Both Time-reversal and Inversion Symmetry

We will show that for a spineless system with both time-reversal (T) and inversion (P) symmetry its Bloch Hamiltonian [formula] can always be taken as real valued under some certain gauge choice. To be general, plane waves [formula] are taken as basis set to describe [formula], where [formula] are the reciprocal lattice vectors. With the above chosen basis set, the invariance under time reversal operator T can be expressed as,

[formula]

and that of the inversion symmetry reads

[formula]

, where the unitary matrix Ô can be defined as Ônm = 1 for n =  - m and zero for all the other matrix elements. From the above two equations, it is obvious that [formula] is real.

Topology of bulk Node-line Hamiltonian

As shown in main text, the effective hamiltonian for bulk Node-line state can be written as

[formula]

, where [formula]=(dx,dy,dz) and [formula]. Taking dx=kz, dy=0 and dz=M - B(k2x + k2y + k2z) can reproduce the bulk node-line state when [formula]. According to R. S. K. Mong et al. [\cite=mong], to check its boundary state in surface perpendicular to kz this bulk hamiltonian should be reformulated as

[formula]

Here [formula] denotes in-plane coordinates (kx,ky) and [formula], [formula] and [formula] are vectors in space spanned by σ. The above bulk hamiltonian is parabola in plane spanned by [formula] and [formula]. Its origin is within the concave side of the parabola when [formula] taking the value satisfying [formula]. Thus, there is topologically protected surface states nestled inside of projected node-line with zero eigen energy to form "drumhead"-like state.
