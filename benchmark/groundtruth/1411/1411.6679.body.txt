Syndetic Model of Fundamental Interactions Ernest Ma Physics & Astronomy Department and Graduate Division, University of California, Riverside, California 92521, USA

With the 2012 discovery [\cite=atlas12] [\cite=cms12] of the 125 GeV particle at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), and the likelihood of it being the one physical neutral Higgs boson h of the standard model (SM) of quarks and leptons, it appears that the SM is essentially complete. Nevertheless, there are at least three loose ends. (1) The SM predicts a source of strong CP nonconservation (the neutron electric dipole moment) which is not observed. (2) The SM does not have a suitable candidate for the dark matter (DM) of the Universe. (3) The SM does not specify a unique fundamental (renormalizable) mechanism for nonzero neutrino masses, which are required for neutrino oscillations. Whereas well-known piecemeal solutions of each problem exist, it is worth exploring the possibility that these three issues are in fact interconnected. I propose in the following a syndetic model with this idea in mind.

Under the proposed well-known anomalous U(1)PQ symmetry [\cite=pq], the SM fermions transform as shown in Table 1. The new particles all have PQ charges. They include a heavy singlet quark Q of charge -  1  /  3 and three heavy neutral singlet fermions N1R,N2R,N3R, as well as one scalar doublet (η+,η0), one scalar singlet χ+ and one scalar singlet χ0. Another scalar singlet ζ0 with two units of PQ charge contains the axion [\cite=we78] [\cite=wi78] as U(1)PQ is spontaneously broken. This solves the strong CP problem. A residual discrete Z2 symmetry also exists in this case, and acts as a good symmetry for cold dark matter, as was pointed out recently [\cite=dmt14]. Since some of the SM quarks as well as the heavy Q transform under U(1)PQ, this model is a hybrid of the two well-known examples of realistic axion models: one where only Q transforms [\cite=k79] [\cite=svz80] (KSVZ) and one where there is no Q but the SM quarks transform [\cite=dfs81] [\cite=z80] (DFSZ). The important distinction in the present proposal is that the SM Higgs doublet couples at tree level only to the second and third families of quarks and charged leptons, i.e. they do not transform under U(1)PQ. On the other hand, the first family becomes massive only through interactions with Q and N in the presence of U(1)PQ symmetry, thus linking their origin of mass through the one Higgs boson h of the SM with dark matter [\cite=m14] as well as the solution of the strong CP problem [\cite=dmt14]. Because there is only one Q which couples to ζ in Ref. [\cite=dmt14] as in the KSVZ model, the domain wall number is 1 in those cases, and that model is cosmologically safe [\cite=s82]. Here the axion couples to both Q as well as u and d, so it suffers the same domain wall problem as the DFSZ model which requires new physics interventions [\cite=s82]. As for neutrinos, they will acquire nonzero Majorana masses, using the scotogenic mechanism [\cite=m06], from the Greek scotos meaning darkness.

Under the exactly conserved discrete Z2 symmetry, all SM particles are even. The dark sector consists of particles odd under Z2, namely Q, N1, N2, N3, (η+,η0), χ+, and χ0. Their only direct interactions with ζ0 are

[formula]

Thus Q and N are expected to acquire large masses from the vacuum expectation value of ζ0, whereas the mass-squared matrix spanning (χR,χI) where [formula] is of the form

[formula]

This is suggestive of having χI as the lightest particle of odd Z2 and thus a DM candidate.

Since (u,d)L has PQ charge 2, it does not couple to Φ. Hence u and d quarks are massless at tree level. However, the mixing of η+ with χ+ and η0 with χ0 through 〈φ0〉 allows both to acquire small masses in one loop as shown.

The resulting 3  ×  3 mass matrix linking L to qR for either sector is of the form

[formula]

where m33,m22,m23 are tree-level, and m11,m12,m13 are one-loop radiative masses. Since the mass eigenvalues in each quark sector are hierarchical, and the (13) and (23) mixing angles are very small, each mass matrix is diagonalized on the left by

[formula]

where ε13  =  m13 / m33, ε23  =  m23 / m33, and tan θ  =  m12 / m22. The mass eigenvalues are then

[formula]

and the quark mixing matrix [formula] has the elements

[formula]

Numericaly, in the d quark sector, the radiative entries m11≃5 MeV and m12≃22 MeV, assuming θu is very small, whereas the tree-level mass m22≃92 MeV. This requires the tree-level ms to be small compared to the tree-level mb, but not very large compared to the radiative mass terms. In other words, there is no theoretical understanding of these mass ratios in this model.

Radiative electron and Majorana neutrino masses are also generated. In contrast to Eq. (3), the resulting 3  ×  3 charged-lepton mass matrix linking L to lR is of the form

[formula]

where m33,m22,m32 are tree-level, and m11,m21,m31 are one-loop radiative masses. As a result, it is diagonalized on the left by

[formula]

where ε21  =  m21 / m22, ε31  =  m31 / m33, ε32  =  m32 / m33, and mτ≃m33, mμ≃m22, me≃m11. As for the 3  ×  3 neutrino mass matrix, it is all radiative as in the original scotogenic model [\cite=m06]. Without the imposition of a flavor symmetry, there are no specific predictions of mixing angles or masses.

The radiative mass entries of Eqs. (3) and (9) are of the form [\cite=m14] [\cite=fm14]

[formula]

where fη and fχ are the respective Yukawa couplings in Figs. 1, 2, and 3, μ is the corresponding trilinear scalar coupling to φ0, [formula] GeV is the vacuum expectation value of φ0, M is either the mass of Q or N, x1,2  =  m21,2 / M2, and m21,2 are the eigenvalues of the (η,χ) mass-squared matrix. Note that M comes from the vacuum expectation value of ζ.

If all fermion masses in a given sector, say (d,s,b) come from tree-level couplings due to a single Higgs boson, then the diagonalization of that mass matrix automatically diagonalizes the Higgs Yukawa couplings. However, since some of the mass entries are one-loop effects, this will not be the case, because the corresponding Higgs Yukawa coupling is then not exactly equal to m / v, as pointed out recently [\cite=fm14]. As a result, there will be small off-diagonal Higgs Yukawa couplings to quarks, which induces small flavor-changing neutral-current processes. The most sensitive probe of this effect is K0  -  q0 mixing in the quark sector and μ  →  eγ in the lepton sector.

Since m11, m12, and m13 in Eq. (3) are radiative masses, the corresponding Higgs Yukawa coupling matrix is of the form

[formula]

where δ is a loop factor computed exactly in Ref. [\cite=fm14]. Let [formula] be diagonal, then [formula] will have off-diagonal pieces, i.e. flavor-changing neutral currents. Using Eq. (4) and the fact that UR has suppressed off-diagonal entries relative to UL, the dominant effective operator for K0  -  q0 mixing through Higgs exchange is given by

[formula]

Using v  =  246 GeV, mh  =  125 GeV, and ms  =  55 MeV, this contribution to the KL  -  KS mass difference is - 1.9  ×  10- 14δ2 GeV [\cite=bm14], as compared to the experimental value of 3.484  ×  10- 15 GeV. Allowing for a 10% uncertainty in the SM contribution, this means that δ may be as large as 0.135.

In the charged-lepton sector, after diagonalizing Eq. (9), flavor violating decays such as μ  →  eγ will occur. This is dominated by the radiative transition l2L  →  l1Rγ and its amplitude is proportional to m21  ~  ε21mμ. Its calulation is analogous to that of the muon anomalous magnetic moment given in Ref. [\cite=fm14], i.e.

[formula]

where

[formula]

The branching fraction of μ  →  eγ is constrained by the current experimental upper bound [\cite=meg13] according to

[formula]

For mN  <  1 TeV, this requires ε21 to be less than about 10- 5. This implies that a flavor symmetry, e.g. Z3, is desirable in a more complete model to make m21 zero.

At the Large Hadron Collider, the heavy quark Q may be produced in pairs if kinematically allowed. Consider the decay chain:

[formula]

then if N is dark matter, a distinct signature of "2 jets + e± + μ∓ + missing energy" may be observed. This same final state is also possible in the model of Ref. [\cite=m14] and has been analyzed in Ref. [\cite=mn14], but the topology here is different and will be studied further elsewhere.

In conclusion, a syndetic model of fundamental interactions has been presented in the context of having one and only one Higgs boson in accordance with the standard model. The difference here is that radiative masses are obtained for the first family of quarks and leptons, as well as for all neutrinos. The U(1)PQ symmetry is implemented to solve the strong CP problem, in such a way that an exactly conserved residual Z2 discrete symmetry remains to support a candidate particle for cold dark matter. The same Z2 symmetry enables the one-loop radiative masses. The new particles required are possibly observable at the Large Hadron Collider in the near future.
