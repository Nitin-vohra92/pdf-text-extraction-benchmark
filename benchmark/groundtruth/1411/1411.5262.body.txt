A derivation of two quadratic transformations contiguous to that of Gauss via a differential equation approach

1.   Introduction

The quadratic transformation for the Gauss hypergeometric function [formula] we consider here is the one originally obtained by Gauss in the form (see, for example, [\cite=AAR])

[formula]

valid when |x| < 1 and |4x / (1 + x)2| < 1 and provided 2b is neither zero nor a negative integer. Bailey [\cite=B] re-derived this result by employing the classical Watson summation theorem for the [formula] series. In the standard text of Rainville [\cite=R], the transformation ([\ref=e11]) was derived using the differential equation satisfied by [formula].

In 2001, Rathie and Kim [\cite=RK] established two transformation formulas contiguous to ([\ref=e11]) with the help of a contiguous version of Watson's summation theorem due to Lavoie et al. These are given in the following theorem.

.  If |x| < 1 and |4x / (1 + x)2| < 1 then

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

[formula]

provided 2b  ±  1 is neither zero nor a negative integer, respectively.

Here we give an alternative demonstration of the quadratic transformations ([\ref=e12]) and ([\ref=e13]) by adopting the differential equation approach employed by Rainville. It is worth remarking that these transformations cannot be derived completely by the hypergeometric differential equation, but that a related second-order differential equation has to be solved by the standard Frobenius method.

Before we give our alternative derivation of ([\ref=e12]) and ([\ref=e13]) in Section 3, we first present an outline of the arguments employed by Rainville [\cite=R] to establish the Gauss transformation ([\ref=e11]).

2.  Derivation of ([\ref=e11]) by Rainville's method

The hypergeometric function [formula] satisfies the differential equation [\cite=AAR], [\cite=DLMF]

[formula]

If we put c = 2b and make the change of variable z = 4x / (1 + x)2, then equation ([\ref=e21]) becomes

[formula]

If we now put w = (1 + x)2ay, then after some simplification we find

[formula]

of which one solution is

[formula]

The differential equation ([\ref=e22]) is invariant under the change of variable from x to - x. Hence, if we introduce the new independent variable v = x2 the equation describing y becomes

[formula]

We observe that ([\ref=e22]) is of the same form as the hypergeometric differential equation ([\ref=e21]), which therefore has in |v| < 1 the two solutions [\cite=DLMF]

[formula]

We observe that the differential equation ([\ref=e22]) has the solution ([\ref=e23]) valid in |4x / (1 + x)2| < 1, provided 2b is neither zero nor a negative integer. At the same time, equation ([\ref=e22]) has the solutions ([\ref=e25]) with v = x2 valid in |x| < 1. Therefore, subject to these conditions, there exist constants A and B such that

[formula]

[formula]

The left-hand side and the first member on the right-hand side of the above expression are both analytic at x = 0, but the remaining term is not due to the presence of the factor x1 - 2b. Hence B = 0 and by considering the terms at x = 0 it is easily seen that A = 1. This leads to the required quadratic transformation given in ([\ref=e11]).

3.  An alternative derivation of Theorem 1

We first establish the quadratic transformation ([\ref=e12]). With c = 2b + 1 in ([\ref=e21]) and the change of variable z = 4x / (1 + x)2 we obtain

[formula]

which has a solution [formula]. With the further change of dependent variable w = (1 + x)2ay, we find after some simplification

[formula]

A solution of ([\ref=e31]) is consequently

[formula]

The differential equation ([\ref=e31]) is not invariant under the change of variable x to - x, and so we cannot reduce it to the hypergeometric equation ([\ref=e21]). Inspection of ([\ref=e31]) shows that the point x = 0 is a regular singular point. Accordingly, we seek two linearly independent solutions of ([\ref=e31]) by the Frobenius method and let

[formula]

where λ is the indicial exponent. Substitution of this form for y in ([\ref=e31]) then leads after a little simplification to

[formula]

[formula]

The coefficients of x- 1 must vanish to yield the indicial equation

[formula]

so that λ = 0 and λ =  - 2b. Equating the coefficients of xn for non-negative integer n, we obtain

[formula]

With the choice λ = 0, we have

[formula]

Solution of this three-term recurrence with the help of Mathematica generates the values given by

[formula]

the general values being established by induction. Substitution in ([\ref=e32]) then yields one solution of ([\ref=e31]) given by

[formula]

when |x| < 1.

A second solution is obtained by taking λ =  - 2b in ([\ref=e33]) to yield

[formula]

This generates the values

[formula]

A second solution of ([\ref=e31]) is therefore given by

[formula]

when |x| < 1.

It then follows, when |x| < 1 and |4x / (1 + x)2| < 1 and provided 2b + 1 is neither zero nor a negative integer, that there exist constants A and B such that

[formula]

Now the left-hand side of ([\ref=e34]) and the solution y1 are both analytic at x = 0, whereas the solution y2 is not analytic at x = 0 due to the presence of the factor x- 2b. Hence B = 0 and, by putting x = 0 in ([\ref=e34]), it is easily seen that A = 1. This then yields the result stated in ([\ref=e12]).

A similar procedure can be employed to establish the quadratic transformation in ([\ref=e13]). Putting c = 2b - 1 in ([\ref=e21]) and carrying out the same sequence of transformations, we obtain the differential equation satisfied by

[formula]

in the form

[formula]

Substitution of ([\ref=e32]) then leads to the three-term recurrence for the coefficients cn

[formula]

subject to the indicial equation λ(λ + 2b - 2) = 0. The choice of indicial exponent λ = 0 yields with the help of Mathematica the values of the coefficients given by

[formula]

with c1 = 2a / (2b - 1), and the choice λ = 2 - 2b yields

[formula]

with c1 = 2(a - 2b + 2) / (3 - 2b).

Consequently two solutions of the differential equation ([\ref=e36]) are

[formula]

and

[formula]

[formula]

when |x| < 1. It then follows, when |x| < 1, |4x / (1 + x)2| < 1 and provided 2b - 1 is neither zero nor a negative integer, that there exist constants A and B such that the function in ([\ref=e35]) can be expressed as Ay1 + By2. For the same reasons as in the previous case we find A = 1 and B = 0, thereby establishing ([\ref=e13]).
