Nonstandard Higgs decays in the E6 inspired SUSY models

Introduction

The discovery of Higgs boson may provide a window into new physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). Indeed, physics beyond the SM may affect the Higgs decay rates to SM particles and give rise to new channels of Higgs decays. In this context it is especially interesting to consider the nonstandard decays of the SM-like Higgs boson within well motivated extensions of the SM. Here we focus on the E6 inspired SUSY models which are based on the SU(3)C  ×  SU(2)W  ×  U(1)Y  ×  U(1)N gauge group, where

[formula]

The two anomaly-free U(1)ψ  and U(1)χ symmetries can originate from the breakings E6  →   SO(10)  ×  U(1)ψ, SO(10)  →  SU(5)  ×  U(1)χ. To ensure anomaly cancellation the particle spectrum in these models is extended to fill out three complete 27-dimensional representations of the gauge group E6. Each 27-plet contains one generation of ordinary matter; singlet fields, Si; up and down type Higgs doublets, Hui and Hdi; charged ±  1 / 3 coloured exotics Di, i. The presence of exotic matter in E6 inspired SUSY models generically lead to non-diagonal flavour transitions and rapid proton decay. To suppress flavour changing processes as well as baryon and lepton number violating operators one can impose a set of discrete symmetries [\cite=King:2005jy] [\cite=King:2005my]. The E6 inspired SUSY models with extra U(1)N gauge symmetry and suppressed flavor-changing transitions, as well as baryon number violating operators allow exotic matter to survive down to the TeV scale that may lead to spectacular new physics signals at the LHC which were analysed in [\cite=King:2005jy] [\cite=King:2005my] [\cite=King:2006vu] [\cite=King:2006rh] [\cite=Athron:2010zz] [\cite=Athron:2011ew]. Only in this Exceptional Supersymmetric Standard Model (E6SSM) [\cite=King:2005jy] [\cite=King:2005my] right-handed neutrinos do not participate in the gauge interactions so that they may be superheavy, shedding light on the origin of the mass hierarchy in the lepton sector and providing a mechanism for the generation of the baryon asymmetry in the Universe via leptogenesis [\cite=King:2008qb]. Recently the particle spectrum and collider signatures associated with it were studied within the constrained version of the E6SSM [\cite=Athron:2008np] [\cite=Athron:2009ue] [\cite=Athron:2009bs] [\cite=Athron:2011wu] [\cite=Athron:2012sq].

E6  inspired  SUSY  models  with  exact  H2  symmetry

Here we study the nonstandard Higgs decays within the E6 inspired SUSY models in which a single discrete H2 symmetry forbids tree-level flavor-changing transitions and the most dangerous baryon and lepton number violating operators [\cite=Nevzorov:2012hs]. These models imply that near some high energy scale (scale MX) E6 or its subgroup is broken down to SU(3)C  ×  SU(2)W  ×  U(1)Y  ×  U(1)ψ  ×  U(1)χ  ×  ZM2, where ZM2 = ( - 1)3(B - L) is a matter parity. Below scale MX the particle content of the considered models involves three copies of 27i-plets and a set of Ml and [formula] supermultiplets from the incomplete 27'l and [formula] representations of E6. All matter superfields, that fill in complete 27i-plets, are odd under H2 discrete symmetry while the supermultiplets [formula] can be either odd or even. All supermultiplets Ml are even under the H2 symmetry and therefore can be used for the breakdown of gauge symmetry. In the simplest case the set of Ml includes Hu, Hd, S and L4, where L4 and [formula] are lepton SU(2)W doublet and anti-doublet supermultiplets that originate from a pair of additional 27'L and [formula].

At low energies (i.e. TeV scale) the superfields Hu, Hd and S play the role of Higgs fields. The vacuum expectation values (VEVs) of these superfields ([formula], [formula] and [formula]) break the SU(2)W  ×  U(1)Y  ×  U(1)N gauge symmetry down to U(1)em associated with the electromagnetism. In the simplest scenario [formula], [formula] and [formula] are odd under the H2 symmetry. As a consequence [formula], [formula] and [formula] from the [formula] get combined with the superposition of the corresponding components from 27i so that the resulting vectorlike states gain masses of order of MX. On the other hand L4 and [formula] are even under the H2 symmetry. These supermultiplets form TeV scale vectorlike states to render the lightest exotic quark unstable. In this simplest scenario the exotic quarks are leptoquarks.

The H2 symmetry allows the Yukawa interactions in the superpotential that originate from 27'l  ×  27'm  ×  27'n and 27'l  ×  27i  ×  27k. One can easily check that the corresponding set of operators does not contain any that lead to the rapid proton decay. Since the set of multiplets Ml contains only one pair of doublets Hd and Hu the H2 symmetry also forbids unwanted FCNC processes at the tree level. The gauge group and field content of the E6 inspired SUSY models considered here can originate from the orbifold GUT models in which the splitting of GUT multiplets can be naturally achieved [\cite=Nevzorov:2012hs].

In the simplest scenario discussed above extra matter beyond the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) fill in complete SU(5) representations. As a result the gauge coupling unification remains almost exact in the one-loop approximation. It was also shown that in the two-loop approximation the unification of the gauge couplings in the considered scenario can be achieved for any phenomenologically acceptable value of α3(MZ), consistent with the central measured low energy value [\cite=King:2007uj].

As mentioned before, the gauge symmetry in the E6 inspired SUSY models being considered here, is broken so that the low-energy effective Lagrangian of these models is invariant under both ZM2 and H2 symmetries. Since H2  =  ZM2  ×  ZE2 the ZE2 symmetry associated with exotic states is also conserved. The invariance of the Lagrangian under the ZE2 symmetry implies that the lightest exotic state, which is odd under this symmetry, must be stable. Using the method proposed in [\cite=Hesselbach:2007te] [\cite=Hesselbach:2007ta] [\cite=Hesselbach:2008vt] it was argued that there are theoretical upper bounds on the masses of the lightest and second lightest inert neutralino states [\cite=Hall:2010ix] [\cite=Hall:2010ny] [\cite=Hall:2011au] [\cite=Hall:2013bua]. These states are predominantly the fermion components of the two SM singlet superfields Si from 27i which are odd under the ZE2 symmetry. Their masses do not exceed 60 - 65   so that the lightest and second lightest inert neutralino states (H̃01 and H̃02) tend to be the lightest exotic particles in the spectrum [\cite=Hall:2010ix] [\cite=Hall:2010ny] [\cite=Hall:2011au] [\cite=Hall:2013bua].

The ZM2 symmetry conservation ensures that R-parity is also conserved. Since the lightest inert neutralino H̃01 is also the lightest R-parity odd state either the lightest R-parity even exotic state or the lightest R-parity odd state with ZE2 =  + 1 must be absolutely stable. In the considered E6 inspired SUSY models most commonly the second stable state is the lightest ordinary neutralino χ01 (ZE2 =  + 1). Both stable states are natural dark matter candidates.

When |mH̃01|  ≪  MZ the couplings of the lightest inert neutralino to the gauge bosons, Higgs states, quarks and leptons are very small resulting in very small annihilation cross section for H̃01H̃01  →  , making the cold dark matter density much larger than its measured value. In principle, H̃01 could account for all or some of the observed cold dark matter density if it had a mass close to half the Z mass. In this case the lightest inert neutralino states annihilate mainly through an s-channel Z-boson [\cite=Hall:2010ix], [\cite=Hall:2009aj]. However the usual SM-like Higgs boson decays more than 95% of the time into either H̃01 or H̃02 in these cases while the total branching ratio into SM particles is suppressed. Because of this the corresponding scenarios are basically ruled out nowadays [\cite=Hall:2013bua].

The simplest phenomenologically viable scenarios imply that the lightest inert neutralinos are extremely light. For example, these states can be substantially lighter than 1  . In this case, light H̃01 forms hot dark matter in the Universe but gives only a very minor contribution to the dark matter density while the lightest ordinary neutralino may account for all or some of the observed cold dark matter density.

Exotic Higgs decays

As discussed earlier, the E6 inspired SUSY models considered here involves three families of up and down type Higgs-like doublet supermultiplets (Hui and Hdi) and three SM singlet superfields (Si) that carry U(1)N charges. One family of the Higgs-like doublets and one SM singlet develop VEVs breaking gauge symmetry. The fermionic components of other Higgs-like and singlet superfields form inert neutralino and chargino states. The Yukawa interactions of inert Higgs superfields are described by the superpotential

[formula]

where α,β = 1,2 . Without loss of generality it is always possible to choose the basis so that λαβ  =  λαα  δαβ. In this basis the masses of inert charginos are given by

[formula]

In our analysis here we choose the VEV of the SM singlet field s to be large enough (s≃12  ) to ensure that the experimental constraints on Z' boson mass and Z - Z' mixing are satisfied. To avoid the LEP lower limit on the masses of inert charginos we also choose the Yukawa couplings λαα so that all inert chargino states have masses which are larger than 100  . In the following analysis we also require the validity of perturbation theory up to the GUT scale that constrains the allowed range of all Yukawa couplings.

Here we restrict our consideration to the part of the parameter space that corresponds to λααs  ≫  fαβv,  αβv. In that limit two lightest inert neutralino states H̃01 and H̃02 are predominantly inert singlinos. These states tend to be substantially lighter than 100  .

When the SUSY breaking scale MS is considerably larger than the electroweak (EW) scale, the mass matrix of the CP-even Higgs sector has a hierarchical structure and can be diagonalized using the perturbation theory [\cite=Kovalenko:1998dc] [\cite=Nevzorov:2000uv] [\cite=Nevzorov:2001um] [\cite=Nevzorov:2004ge] [\cite=Miller:2003ay]. Here we are going to focus on the scenarios with moderate values of tan β (tan β  <  2 - 3). For these values of tan β the mass of the lightest CP-even Higgs boson mh1 is very sensitive to the choice of the coupling λ(Mt). In particular, in order to get mh1≃125   the coupling λ(Mt) must be larger than g'1≃0.47. When [formula], the qualitative pattern of the Higgs spectrum is rather similar to the one which arises in the PQ symmetric NMSSM [\cite=Nevzorov:2004ge] [\cite=Miller:2003ay] [\cite=Miller:2003hm] [\cite=Miller:2005qua] [\cite=Panagiotakopoulos:2000wp]. In the considered limit the heaviest CP-even, CP-odd and charged states are almost degenerate and lie beyond the [formula] range while the mass of the second lightest CP-even Higgs state is set by MZ' [\cite=King:2005jy]. In this case the lightest CP-even Higgs boson is the analogue of the SM Higgs field.

In contrast with the MSSM, the lightest Higgs boson in the E6 inspired SUSY models can be heavier than 110 - 120   even at tree level. In the two-loop approximation the lightest Higgs boson mass does not exceed 150 - 155   [\cite=King:2005jy]. Recently, the RG flow of the Yukawa couplings and the theoretical upper bound on the lightest Higgs boson mass in these models were analysed in the vicinity of the quasi-fixed point [\cite=Nevzorov:2013ixa] that appears as a result of the intersection of the invariant and quasi-fixed lines [\cite=Nevzorov:2001vj]. It was argued that near the quasi-fixed point the upper bound on the mass of the SM-like Higgs boson is rather close to 125   [\cite=Nevzorov:2013ixa].

The lightest and second lightest inert neutralinos interact with the Z-boson and the SM-like Higgs state. The corresponding part of the Lagrangian, that describes these interactions, can be presented in the following form [\cite=Nevzorov:2013tta]:

[formula]

where α,β = 1,2. In Eq. ([\ref=5]) ψ0α = ( - iγ5)θαH̃0α is the set of inert neutralino eigenstates with positive eigenvalues, while θα equals 0 (1) if the eigenvalue corresponding to H̃0α is positive (negative). The inert neutralinos are labeled according to increasing absolute value of mass, with H̃01 being the lightest inert neutralino.

We further assume that the lightest inert neutralino is substantially lighter than 1   so that it gives only a very minor contribution to the dark matter density. On the other hand we allow the second lightest inert neutralino state to have mass in the GeV range. Although these states are substantially lighter than 100   their couplings to the Z-boson can be rather small because of the inert singlino admixture in these states. Therefore any possible signal which these neutralinos could give rise to at former colliders would be extremely suppressed and such states could remain undetected.

The couplings of the Higgs states to the inert neutralinos originate from the superpotential ([\ref=2]). If all Higgs states except the lightest one are much heavier than the EW scale then the couplings of the SM-like Higgs boson to the lightest and second lightest inert neutralinos are determined by their masses [\cite=Hall:2010ix]. Since we assumed that the mass of H̃01 is lighter than 1   the couplings of the lightest Higgs boson to H̃01H̃01 and H̃01H̃02 are negligibly small and can be ignored in our analysis. Also because of this the experiments for the direct detection of dark matter do not set any stringent constraints on the masses and couplings of the lightest and second lightest inert neutralinos. In the considered case the coupling of the SM-like Higgs state to H̃02 is basically proportional to the second lightest inert neutralino mass divided by the VEV, i.e. Xh22≃|mH̃02| / v [\cite=Hall:2010ix]. This coupling gives rise to the decays of the lightest Higgs boson into H̃02 pairs with partial widths given by [\cite=Nevzorov:2013tta]

[formula]

In order to compare the partial widths associated with the exotic decays of the SM-like Higgs state ([\ref=6]) with the Higgs decay rates into the SM particles we specify two benchmark points (see Table 1). For each benchmark scenario we calculate the spectrum of the inert neutralinos, inert charginos and Higgs bosons as well as their couplings and the branching ratios of the nonstandard decays of the lightest CP-even Higgs state. We fix tan β = 1.5 and λ(Mt) = 0.6. As it was mentioned before, such a large value of λ(Mt) allows mh1 to be 125   for moderate tan β. In Table 1 the masses of the heavy Higgs states are computed in the leading one-loop approximation. In the case of the lightest Higgs boson mass the leading two-loop corrections are taken into account.

From Table 1 it follows that the structure of the Higgs spectrum is extremely hierarchical. As a result the partial decay widths that correspond to the decays of the lightest CP-even Higgs state into the SM particles are basically the same as in the SM. Because of this, for the calculation of the Higgs decay rates into the SM particles we use the results presented in [\cite=King:2012is] where these rates were computed within the SM for different values of the Higgs mass. When mh1≃125   the SM-like Higgs state decays predominantly into b-quark. In the SM the corresponding branching ratio is about 60% whereas the branching ratios associated with Higgs decays into WW, ZZ and γγ are about 20%, 2.1% and 0.23% respectively [\cite=King:2012is]. The total decay width of the Higgs boson near 125 GeV is 3.95  .

For the calculation of the Higgs decay rates into H̃02H̃02 we use Eq. ([\ref=6]). From this equation one can see that the branching ratios of the SM-like Higgs state into the second lightest inert neutralinos depend rather strongly on the masses of these exotic particles. When H̃02 is relatively heavy, i.e. mH̃02  ≫  mb(mh1), the lightest Higgs boson decays predominantly into H̃02H̃02 while the branching ratios for decays into SM particles are suppressed. To ensure that the observed signal associated with the Higgs decays into γγ is not too much suppressed we restrict our consideration here to the GeV scale masses of the second lightest inert neutralino.

The benchmark scenarios (i)-(ii) demonstrate that one can get extremely light H̃01 with mass ~  0.1 - 0.01  , relatively light H̃02, that has a mass of the order of 1 - 0.1  , and a relatively small value of the coupling RZ12 that allows the second lightest inert neutralino to decay within a reasonable time. In these benchmark scenarios the second lightest inert neutralino decays into the lightest one and a fermion-antifermion pair via virtual Z. Since RZ12 is relatively small H̃02 tend to have a long lifetime. If the second lightest inert neutralino state decays during or after Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) it may destroy the agreement between the predicted and observed light element abundances. To preserve the success of the BBN, H̃02 should decay before BBN, i.e. its lifetime τH̃02 has to be smaller than something like 1  . This requirement constrains |RZ12|. Indeed, for mH̃02 = 1   the absolute value of the coupling RZ12 should be larger than 1  ·  10- 6. On the other hand the value of |RZ12| becomes smaller when the mass of the lightest inert neutralino decreases. Therefore in general sufficiently large fine tuning is needed to ensure that [formula] for sub-eV lightest inert neutralino state. The constraint on |RZ12| becomes much more stringent with decreasing mH̃02 because τH̃02  ~  1 / (|RZ12|2m5H̃02). As a result, it is somewhat problematic to satisfy this restriction for [formula].

The benchmark scenarios (i)-(ii) presented in Table 2 indicate that the branching ratio of the decays of SM-like Higgs boson into second lightest inert neutralino can vary from 0.2% to 4.7% (i.e. from 0% to 4.7% for practical purposes) when mH̃02 changes from 0.3   to 1.1  . For smaller (larger) values of the second lightest inert neutralino masses, the branching ratio associated with these nonstandard decays of the lightest CP-even Higgs states is even smaller (larger). At the same time the couplings of H̃01 and H̃02 to the Z-boson are so tiny that the lightest and second lightest inert neutralino states could not be observed before. In particular, their contribution to the Z-boson width tend to be rather small. The Z-boson invisible width is characterized by the effective number of neutrino species Neffν. Its measured value is Nexpν = 2.984  ±  0.008 whereas in the SM Neffν = 3. The contributions of the lightest and second lightest inert neutralino states to the Z-boson width can be parameterized similarly. In the case of benchmark scenarios (i) and (ii) the effective numbers of neutrino species associated with these contributions are 5.8  ·  10- 5 and 0.011 respectively.

The second lightest inert neutralino states, that originate from the decays of the SM-like Higgs boson, sequentially decay into H̃01 and pairs of leptons and quarks via virtual Z. Thus, in principle, the exotic decays of the lightest CP-even Higgs state results in two fermion-antifermion pairs and missing energy in the final state. Nevertheless because coupling RZ12 is quite small H̃02 tend to live longer than 10- 8  . As a consequence the second lightest inert neutralino state typically decays outside the detectors and will not be observed at the LHC. Therefore the decay channel h1  →  H̃02H̃02 normally give rise to an invisible branching ratio of the SM-like Higgs boson.

Conclusions

In this work we consider the nonstandard Higgs decays within the E6 inspired SUSY models based on the SU(3)C  ×  SU(2)W  ×  U(1)Y  ×  U(1)N  ×  ZM2 symmetry in which a single discrete H2 symmetry forbids tree-level flavor-changing transitions and the most dangerous baryon and lepton number violating operators. These models contain at least two states which are absolutely stable and can contribute to the relic density of dark matter. One of these states is a LSP while another one tends to be the lightest ordinary neutralino. In the simplest phenomenologically viable scenarios LSP is expected to be substantially lighter than 1   forming hot dark matter in the Universe. At the same time the lightest ordinary neutralino can account for all or some of the observed cold dark matter relic density.

The masses of the LSP and NLSP are set by the VEVs of the Higgs doublets. As a consequence they give rise to nonstandard decays of the lightest Higgs state. Since the couplings of the SM-like Higgs boson to the LSP and NLSP are determined by their masses LSP does not affect Higgs phenomenology whereas NLSP with GeV scale masses results in substantial branching ratio of the lightest Higgs decays into NLSPs. After being produced NLSP sequentially decays into the LSP and pairs of leptons and quarks via virtual Z. However due to the small couplings of the LSP and NLSPs to the Z-boson NLSP tends to be longlived particle and decays outside the detectors leading to the invisible branching ratio of the SM-like Higgs state.
