Introduction

The interests of studying the set of orbits of the faces of the weight polytopes under the action of the Weyl groups arise partially from the linear algebraic monoid theory [\cite=Pu88] [\cite=Re05] [\cite=So95]. A linear algebraic monoid is irreducible if it is irreducible as a variety. An irreducible monoid is reductive if its unit group is reductive. Let M be a reductive monoid with unit group G. Consider the group action of G  ×  G on M by (g,h)  ·  a  =  gah- 1 for g,h∈G and a∈M. The set [formula] of orbits GaG for this action is a poset with respect to inclusion. Associated with a reductive monoid is a polytope on which the Weyl group W acts naturally. The lattice of orbits of M is isomorphic to the lattice of orbits of the faces of the polytope under the action of W. An interesting problem in linear algebraic monoid theory is to find the orbits of the reductive monoid M. In general, the problem is still open.

Let B be a Borel subgroup of G with maximal torus T  ⊆  B. Denote by [formula] the Zariski closure of T in M, and let [formula]. The cross-section lattice of M by definition is

[formula]

which is isomorphic to [formula]. In particular,

[formula]

It is interesting and challenging to find the cross-section lattice combinatorially. If M has zero and its cross-section lattice has a unique minimal nonzero element, then M is referred to as J-irreducible. The cross-section lattices of J-irreducible monoids are described explicitly in [\cite=PR]. In particular, let G0 be a simisimple algebraic group and ρ:G0  →  GL(V) be a complex irreducible rational representation with highest weight λ. Then G = K*ρ(G0) is reductive and

[formula]

is a J-irreducible monoid and all J-irreducible monoids can be constructed this way up to a finite morphism. Let [formula] be the Lie algebra of G and Φ be its root system with a root basis [formula]. Denote by E the Euclidean space spanned by Π, and by [formula] the fundamental dominant weights with respect to Π. If [formula], the set

[formula]

is called the type of M(λ) or simply the type of λ where [formula]. The result below describing the cross-section lattices of J-irreducible monoids is a summary of Corollary 4.11 and Theorem 4.16 of [\cite=PR].

Theorem A. Let J be the type of M(λ) with λ dominant. Then the nonzero elements of the cross-section lattice of M(λ) are in bijection with the subsets I of Π where no connected component of I lies entirely in J.

The cross-section lattice of M(λ) where the dominant weight λ is the highest root of [formula] was explicitly described in [\cite=LC1] using connected subsets of the affine Dynkin diagram.

The cross-section lattice of the J-irreducible monoid M(λ) can be characterized using polytopes [\cite=Pu88] [\cite=Re05] [\cite=So95]. The polytope associated with M(λ) is the convex hull of the orbit Wλ, called the weight polytope of M(λ), or simply the weight polytope of λ. If λ is the highest root of [formula] then the weight polytope is a root polytope. The following result can be deduced from [\cite=KKMS73] and [\cite=Pu88] and [\cite=So95].

Theorem B. There is a one to one correspondence between the cross-section lattice of M(λ) and the set of orbits of the faces of the weight polytope under the action of the Weyl group.

The weight polytope of λ depends only on the type J of λ, so we call J the type of the weight polytope. All the strongly dominant weights are of the same type [formula], the empty set.

Theorem C. If the type of the weight polytope is J, then the set of orbits of the nonempty faces of the weight polytope is in bijection with the set of subsets I of Π where no connected component of I lies entirely in J.

Though the theory of algebraic monoids accelerated in the last three decades, some researchers do not know that the subject exists, and based on some minimal evidence, some are discouraged by prerequisites which seem a little hard to defeat.

In this paper, we restate Theorem C in terms of the language of Lie algebras and prove it using techniques from the theory of Lie algebras to make it more accessible to Lie algebraists. Adding a new node {  -  λ} to the Dynkin diagram of the Lie algebra [formula] by drawing a single laced edge between {  -  λ} and αi if (λ,αi) > 0 where ( ~ , ~ ) is the inner product on the Euclidean space E, we obtain an extended Dynkin diagram. Theorem C can then be described in Theorem D, which is a consequence of our Theorems [\ref=bijection] and [\ref=polyproperties].

Theorem D. The orbits of the nonempty faces of the weight polytope under the action of the Weyl group are in bijection with the connected subdiagrams of the extended Dynkin diagram that contain the extended node {  -  λ}.

If λ is the highest root of the Lie algebra [formula], then Theorem D specializes the bijection for root polytopes proved in [\cite=CM], which makes use of the properties of the root system of [formula]. The methods in [\cite=CM] motivate us to prove Theorem D without using the theory of linear algebraic monoids. Our arguments are based on the weight set of [formula], which is lacking of some advantages of the root system, so we need new techniques to over come this difficulty. This is reflected in the proofs of the results in Section [\ref=proof]. We notice that different researchers study algebraic, geometrical, and combinatorial properties of root polytopes, and we refer the reader to [\cite=ABH] [\cite=CM2] [\cite=M1] [\cite=M2] for more details.

Our first main result Theorem [\ref=keytheorem] states that a standard parabolic face is the convex hull of the orbit of a parabolic subgroup of W acting on the dominant weight. This leads to the proof of Theorem [\ref=bijection]. The second main result Theorem [\ref=span] is an analogue of [\cite=CM] for weight polytopes, stating that the linear space spanned by a face of a weight polytope is in fact spanned by roots. This result is used to prove that all nonempty faces of a weight polytope are parabolic in Theorem [\ref=polyproperties].

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides some necessary background knowledge. Section 3 is a summary of notation and terminology. Section 4 is dedicated to the proof of the main results of the paper.

Preliminaries

Let [formula] be a finite-dimensional complex simple Lie algebra. We fix a Cartan subalgebra [formula] of [formula] and assume that Φ is the root system of [formula] with respect to [formula]. Then [formula] has the following root space decomposition

[formula]

Let [formula], [formula] be a root basis of Φ, and W be the Weyl group generated by the simple reflections [formula]. Let [formula] be the fundamental weights with respect to Π, and let [formula] be the coweights of ωi. We have (i,αj) = δij for [formula].

Denote by P(λ) the set of weights of the irreducible highest weight module with highest dominant weight λ. Then P(λ) is saturated, and there is a partial order on P(λ): μ  ≤  ν if ν  -  μ is a sum of simple roots. We will use repeatedly the following known results in the representation theory of Lie algebras.

For μ∈P(λ) and αi∈Π, suppose that the αi-string through μ is: [formula]. Then [formula]. In particular, if (μ,αi) > 0, then μ  -  αi∈P(λ).

Let Φ be a root system and let Φ' be the intersection of Φ with a subspace of E. Then Φ' is a root system in the subspace spanned by Φ'.

Let [formula] and WI be the parabolic subgroup of W generated by sαi for i∈I. Let WI be the minimal length representatives of left cosets of WI in W. Then

[formula]

Every element w∈W has a unique decomposition w = wIwI such that l(w) = l(wI) + l(wI), where wI∈WI,wI∈WI.

Notation and Terminology

Fix a dominant weight λ in the euclidean space E spanned by Π, once and forever. The convex hull [formula] of P(λ) is a polytope equal to the convex hull of Wλ.

Let [formula]. Then all the coefficients mi's are non-negative rational numbers. Without loss of generality, we may assume that all mi's are non-negative integers since a dilation of a polytope and itself have the same face lattice structure. The following is a consequence of Proposition 11.3 of [\cite=Kac].

If all the coefficients in [formula] are integers, then P(λ) is the intersection of the weight polytope [formula] with the root lattice.

If we express a weight μ as a linear combination of simple roots αi, we use ci(μ) to denote the coefficient of αi. For example, ci(λ)  =  mi. Let Pi be the set of weights μ such that (μ,i) = mi, in other words,

[formula]

Each coordinate face Fi is a face of the weight polytope [formula] since Fi sits in the hyperplane {x∈E|(x,i) = mi} and all other weights in Fi are in the half-space {x∈E|(x,i)  ≤  mi}. It is, however, possible that Fi is not a facet.

For any [formula], the face

[formula]

is standard parabolic, since [formula]. On the other hand, for any standard parabolic face F, there exists [formula] such that F = FI. Clearly,

[formula]

is the set of all weights in FI. Note that [formula]. For convenience, let [formula] and [formula]. So the standard parabolic face FI is not empty for all [formula].

Weight Polytope

The purpose of this section is to show in Theorem [\ref=bijection] that there is a bijection between the set of standard parabolic faces and the set of certain connected components in the extended Dynkin diagram, and then in Theorem [\ref=polyproperties] that all nonempty faces of a weight polytope are parabolic.

If I is a subset of [formula], let [formula] be the complement set of [formula], and let ΠI  =  {αi∈Π|i∈I}. We begin our discussion by introducing the following two lemmas.

Let μ,ν be weights in a standard parabolic proper face FI of [formula]. If μ  <  ν then there are simple roots [formula] such that [formula] and all [formula] are weights in FI for [formula].

Let [formula] where [formula] and aj are positive integers for all j∈J. We claim that [formula] and (ν  -  μ,αj0) > 0 for some j0∈J. Otherwise, if [formula], then ci(μ) = mi - ai < mi, which contradicts that μ∈FI. If (ν  -  μ,αj)  ≤  0 for all j∈J, then (ν  -  μ,ν  -  μ) = 0, and hence ν  =  μ, which is a contradiction.

Use induction on the height of ν  -  μ: [formula] If ht(ν  -  μ) = 1, then the result is true. Assume the result in Lemma [\ref=chainlemma] is true for ht(ν  -  μ) = k - 1 where k > 1. We show that the result is true for ht(ν  -  μ) = k case by case.

Case 1: (ν,αj0) > 0.

It follows from Proposition [\ref=string] that ν  -  αj0 is a weight in FI, and μ  <  ν  -  αj0 with ht(ν  -  αj0  -  μ) = k - 1 > 0. Applying the induction hypothesis, we have [formula] such that all [formula] are weights in FI for [formula]. Let αik  =  αj0. Then [formula] and all [formula] are weights in FI for [formula].

Case 2: (ν,αj0)  ≤  0.

In this case, (μ,αj0) < (ν,αj0)  ≤  0. Then μ  +  αj0 is a weight in FI by Proposition [\ref=string]. Therefore, ht(ν - (μ  +  αj0)) = k - 1 > 0 and μ  +  αj0  <  ν. The induction hypothesis shows that [formula] where all [formula] are weights in FI for [formula]. Reorder the indices by setting αi1  =  αj0 and αit  =  αit - 1 for [formula]. Then we have [formula] and all [formula] are weights in FI for [formula]. [formula]

The following lemma is easy to understand by intuition, however, its proof is not trivial and the authors don't find it in any existing literature.

Assume that [formula] where w∈W, aj are positive integers, and αj∈Π for all j∈J. Then there exists u∈WJ such that wλ = uλ.

By Proposition [\ref=decomposition], w = wJwJ where wJ∈WJ and wJ∈WJ with l(w) = l(wJ) + l(wJ). We apply induction on the length l(w).

If l(w) = 0 then result is trivial. If l(w) = 1 then w = sαi for some αi∈Π. If i∈J, then we are done. If i∉J, then αi is linearly independent of {αj|j∈J}. But

[formula]

So, J must be empty, and then WJ  =  1. Therefore, wλ  =  λ.

Assume that l(w) > 1. Let [formula] be a reduced expression. If wJ = 1 then we are done. If [formula] then r  ≥  1. Then wJαr < 0 by [\cite=RK] and r∉J. Write [formula] where bi  ≥  0 for all i∈J. We have

[formula]

since r∉J and (αi,αr)  ≤  0 for i∈J. Divide the discussion into two cases.

Case 1: (wλ, wJαr) = 0. We have

[formula]

It follows that

[formula]

and so sαrwJλ = wJλ. Hence,

[formula]

But [formula]. From the induction hypothesis, there exists an element u∈WJ such that [formula]. Thus, wλ = uλ.

Case 2: (wλ, wJαr) > 0. Now, [formula]. Then,

[formula]

is a weight by Proposition [\ref=string]. Since μ  ≤  λ and wJαr is a negative root, wJαr has to be linear combination of αj's for j∈J. Write γ  =  wJαr. Then wJsαr = sγwJ and

[formula]

where cj  ≥  0. Since l(wJsαrwJ) < l(w), by the induction hypothesis, there exists v∈WJ such that wJsαrwJλ = sγwλ  =  vλ. Let u = sγv∈WJ. Therefore, wλ  =  sγvλ = uλ. This completes the proof. [formula]

For a subset Σ of [formula], denote by Γ(Σ) the subdiagram of the extended Dynkin diagram having Σ as vertices, and Γ0(Σ) the connected component of Γ(Σ) containing {  -  λ}. Denote by VI the set of vertices of [formula]. Let [formula] and let [formula] be the set of indices of the vertices in [formula]. Let EFI be the space spanned by {μ  -  ν|μ,ν∈FI}.

Let [formula] and u0 be the longest element in [formula]. If FI is a standard parabolic face of [formula], then

FI is the convex hull of [formula],

u0λ is the least element in PI, and

EFI is spanned by the simple roots in [formula] and [formula].

For (1), let [formula]. Then [formula], since [formula]. Notice that PI is the set of weights in FI. We obtain that wλ∈FI, and the convex hull of [formula] is contained in FI.

Conversely, for any w∈W assume that [formula] with aj > 0. Then [formula], since ci(wλ) = ci(λ) = mi for all i∈I. By Proposition [\ref=descent], there exists an element u∈WJ such that uλ = wλ. If [formula] is connected in the extended Dynkin diagram, then we are done. Otherwise, we can assume that [formula]. Notice that [formula] is a connected component in the Dynkin diagram. Then [formula]. Write u = xy, where [formula] and y∈WJ'. Thus, wλ = uλ = xyλ = xλ since (λ,αj) = 0 for all j∈J'. In other words, [formula]. It follows that FI is included in the convex hull of [formula]. This completes the proof of (1).

To prove (2), it suffices to show that u0λ < wλ for all [formula], since other weights in PI are linear combinations of [formula] with non-negative coefficients whose sum is equal to 1. Thanks to λ  ≥  u- 10wλ, we have [formula] with aj  ≥  0. It follows that

[formula]

where [formula] since [formula]. So u0λ  ≤  wλ. This proves (2).

We now prove (3). If u0λ  =  λ, then λ is the least element of [formula] by (2) and [formula]. It follows that [formula] and FI  =  {λ}. If u0λ  <  λ, let

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=chainlemma], there are simple roots [formula] such that [formula] are weights in FI for [formula]. Any element λ - wλ is a linear combination of [formula], for [formula]. Hence [formula] span EFI. But [formula] by (1). The dimension of FI is the number of nonzero terms on the right-hand side of ([\ref=Li1]). We claim that aj > 0 for all [formula]. To this end, for any [formula], we can find a shortest connected path:  [formula],  from αj to {  -  λ} in the extended Dynkin diagram. Then the coefficient of αj in [formula] is positive. Hence aj > 0 in ([\ref=Li1]) for [formula], since [formula]. This completes the proof. [formula]

Note that for different subsets [formula], it is possible that FI = FJ.

For any two subsets [formula], FI = FJ if and only if [formula].

(  ⇒  ) Use ηI to denote the least element of FI. If FI = FJ, then they have the same least element ηI( = ηJ). By the proof of (3) in Theorem [\ref=keytheorem],

[formula]

where ai > 0 for all [formula], and bi > 0 for all [formula]. It follows that [formula].

(⇐) This is trivial by (1) of Theorem [\ref=keytheorem]. [formula]

The theorem below follows from Theorem [\ref=keytheorem] and Corollary [\ref=facesEqual].

The standard parabolic faces of [formula] are in bijection with the connected subdiagrams of the extended Dynkin diagram that contain {  -  λ}. This bijection is an isomorphism of posets with respect to inclusion.

This theorem is the Lie algebra version of Theorem C, which is a consequence of [\cite=PR] and [\cite=KKMS73] and [\cite=Pu88] and [\cite=So95]. In fact, the bijection can be explicitly described as: [formula]

All coordinate faces are distinct.

Let ηi be the least element of Fi. We have (ηi,αj)  ≤  0 for all [formula]. Otherwise ηi  -  αj is a weight in Pi  ⊆  Fi by Proposition [\ref=string] and ηi would not be minimal. This yields (ηi,αi) > 0 since (ηi,ηi) > 0. Thus ηi  ≠  ηj, and hence [formula] if [formula]. The coordinate faces Fi and Fj are then distinct since Pi is exactly the set of weights in Fi for all [formula]. [formula]

The following is a criterion that tests whether a coordinate face is a facet.

Let Fi be a coordinate face and ηi be the least element in Fi. Then Fi is a facet if and only if [formula] for all [formula].

(⇒  ) By Theorem [\ref=keytheorem], if Fi is a facet then [formula] where I = {i}. This implies that [formula] and [formula] with aj > 0 for all [formula]. Therefore, [formula] for all [formula].

(⇐) If [formula] for all [formula], then aj > 0 for all [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=chainlemma] or the proof of Theorem [\ref=keytheorem], EFi is spanned by [formula]. Hence dim Fi = n - 1. [formula]

Let α be a root in Φ and μ be a weight in P(λ) and denote the α-string through μ by α - (μ). Then

[formula]

Without loss of generality, we assume that μ is the start of its α-string. Then the weight string is

[formula]

If q is even, the middle weight [formula] is orthogonal to α, and the sum of the two symmetric weights about the middle weight is orthogonal to α. If q is odd, the sum of the two symmetric weights is orthogonal to α. [formula].

The barycenter of the weights in the ith coordinate face Fi is parallel to the ith fundamental weight, and

[formula]

For each [formula], Pi is a disjoint union of αj-strings. It follows from Lemma [\ref=stringSum] that

[formula]

Hence, [formula]. In view of (μ,i) = mi for all μ∈Pi, we have

[formula]

The desired result follows. [formula]

Let [formula]. Then the barycenter of the standard parabolic face FI is [formula] where ai are non-negative rational numbers for all i∈I.

As PI is a disjoint union of αj-strings for any fixed [formula], we know that [formula] for all j∉I. Thus, [formula]. For any j∈I, we have

[formula]

For i,j∈I and μ∈PI, the numbers (i,j) and (μ,j) are rational numbers, so are all ai's. We claim that (μ,αi)  ≥  0 for μ∈PI. If not, it follows from (μ,αi)  <  0 that μ  +  αi∈P(λ), which shows that ci(μ  +  αi) = mi + 1. This contradicts that that μ  ≤  λ. Thus ai  ≥  0, as desired. [formula]

By the lemma above, the barycenter of a standard parabolic face is in the closure of the fundamental Weyl chamber [\cite=Hum]. Since the Weyl group acts on the fundamental chamber transitively, we have

Two distinct standard parabolic faces of the weight polytope [formula] cannot be transformed into one another by elements of the Weyl group.

Let [formula] be a polytope (or cone). Let ν be a fixed vertex. Suppose

[formula]

.

Assume that

[formula]

. [formula]

Every edge of [formula] is parallel to a root.

It suffices to prove this for edges attached to the highest dominant weight λ. Assume that [formula] and the segment

[formula]

The following theorem follows directly from the above lemma.

Given a face F of [formula], let EF  =   Span{μ  -  ν|μ,ν∈F}. Then the space EF is spanned by roots for any face F of [formula].

Now we are ready to show that all nonempty faces of a weight polytope are parabolic. The proof of the following theorem is patented after that of [\cite=CM]. For completeness, we give the proof here.

Every nonempty face of a weight polytope is parabolic.

Let F be a face with dim F = n - p where 1  ≤  p  ≤  n. We use induction on p to prove the desired result. If p = 1 then F is a facet. From Theorem [\ref=span] and Proposition [\ref=bki] it follows that [formula] is a root subsystem of Φ with rank n - 1. Let Π' be a root basis of [formula]. Then there exists w∈W such that wΠ'  ⊆  Π. Let αi be the only fundamental root in Π which does not belong to wΠ'. So wEF is perpendicular to i, denoted by [formula]. Therefore, there exists a real number a such that (x,i) = a for all x∈wF. It follows that {x∈E  |  (x,i) = a} is a supporting hyperplane of the weight polytope. Let li = (w0λ,i) where w0 is the longest element in the Weyl group W. Then li  ≤  a  ≤  mi. This forces a = mi or a = li. If not, vertices λ and - w0λ will be at different sides of the hyperplane {x∈E  |  (x,i) = a}, a contradiction. If a = mi then wF = Fi. If a = li, then - li  =  (λ,i') = mi' where i' =  - w0(i). Hence w0wF = Fi'.

Now we assume that n  ≥  p  >  1 and all faces of the weight polytope [formula] of dimension greater than n - p are parabolic. By the induction hypothesis, without loss of generality, we can assume that F is a facet of a standard parabolic face FI where dim F = n - p and dim FI = n - p + 1. By Theorem [\ref=keytheorem], FI is the convex hull of [formula] and FI is spanned by [formula]. Note that there exists [formula] such that [formula] where [formula]. Meanwhile, there exists a real number a such that (x,j) = a for all x∈wF. Let lj = (ηI,j). Recall ηI = u0λ is the least element in FI where u0 is the longest element in [formula]. Then a = lj or a = mj.

If a = mj then λ∈F. Hence [formula]. We are done. If a = lj, then ηI∈wF. Hence [formula]. Let π be the orthogonal projection of E onto EFI. Then [formula] for all [formula]. Hence [formula] is the coweights with respect to [formula] in root system [formula]. Thus, there exists j' such that u0(π(j)) =  - π(j'). Since u0(FI) = FI, we have [formula]. Thus, F is parabolic, since [formula]. [formula]

We conclude this section by giving the f-polynomial of weight polytopes.

Let [formula] and let J be the type of λ. For each I∈I, let [formula]. Then the f-polynomial of [formula] is

[formula]

Consider the action of the Weyl group W on the faces of [formula]. A simple calculation yields that WI* is the stabilizer of the standard parabolic face F, where F is the convex hull of WIλ. [formula]
