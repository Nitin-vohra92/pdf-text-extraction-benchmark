On the covariances of outdegrees in random plane recursive trees

In 2005 Janson [\cite=SJ_s], extending earlier work of Mahmoud, Smythe, and Szymaski [\cite=mss], established the joint asymptotic normality of the outdegrees of a random plane recursive tree (we refer to [\cite=SJ_s] for references, discussion and statements, and to [\cite=SJ_l] for a much wider context). In particular, he gave the following formula for the entries of the limiting covariance matrix [\cite=SJ_s]:

[formula]

Since this formula is not very convenient to work with (in particular the behavior of σ̃ij as i and/or j grow to infinity is not immediately clear), we found it worthwhile to point out that it may be considerably simplified. Throughout, [formula] denotes the falling factorial.

For all integers [formula], j  ≥  0 we have

[formula]

For the proof we will need two identities involving binomial coefficients that we present in the following two lemmas.

For all integers k  ≥  0, [formula], and j  ≥  k:

[formula]

This is a special case of formula (5.24) in [\cite=GKP] as we have found thanks to the encouragement by one of the referees to search for a source in the literature. It corresponds to m = 0 and s = n + a in the notation used in [\cite=GKP]. However, to keep this letter self-contained we supply a short proof. We proceed by induction over k for all a and j  ≥  k. If k = 0 the equality holds for all [formula] since its left-hand side is (1 - 1)j if j > 0 and 1 if j = 0. Assume it holds for non-negative integers up to k and all values of a and j  ≥  k. Let [formula] be any integer. For j  ≥  k + 1

[formula]

The first sum is zero by the inductive hypothesis. We cancel the l's in the second sum and write it as

[formula]

By the inductive hypothesis (applied to k, a + 1, and j - 1) this sum is zero if j - 1 > k and is ( - 1)j - 1 if j - 1 = k. This proves that the original expression is zero if j > k + 1 and is ( - 1)j if j = k + 1 thus completing the induction.

For all integers [formula], [formula], and [formula] we have

[formula]

We use induction over [formula] for all [formula] and [formula]. (Alternatively i can stay fixed throughout). When j = 0 both sides are [formula]. Assume the statement holds for all integers up to j and all [formula]. We will prove that it holds for j + 1 and all integers [formula]. We have

[formula]

where we have used the inductive hypothesis, first with j and a and then with j and a + 1. This proves Lemma [\ref=lem2].

Proof of Proposition [\ref=prop1]. Assume without loss of generality that 0  ≤  i  ≤  j. We split the right-hand side of [\eqref=sj_sig] as

[formula]

We claim that [\eqref=1stpart] is zero unless i = j in which case it is 4 / (j + 3)3. To see this note that

[formula]

so that

[formula]

Since k  ≤  i and we assumed that i  ≤  j, by Lemma [\ref=lem1], the inner sum is zero unless i = j and if that is the case only the term k = i = j in the outer sum is non-zero and it is

[formula]

by Lemma [\ref=lem1]. To handle [\eqref=2ndpart] we write

[formula]

so that [\eqref=2ndpart] is

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=lem2] (used with a = 3 and i = 0) [\eqref=1stline] is

[formula]

To handle [\eqref=2ndline] we first note that

[formula]

This follows from partial fraction decomposition

[formula]

and

[formula]

which is Lemma [\ref=lem2] used twice, with a = k + 4 and i = 0 for the first equality, and with a = 3 and i = 0 for the second equality. Therefore, [\eqref=2ndline] is

[formula]

Applying Lemma [\ref=lem2] (with a = 4 and general i) to the first term and with a = 3 and i = 0 to the second term we find that [\eqref=2ndline] is

[formula]

Hence, the combined contribution of [\eqref=2ndline] and [\eqref=1stline] is

[formula]

which completes the proof.
