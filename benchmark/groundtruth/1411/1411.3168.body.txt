An accreting low magnetic field magnetar for the ultraluminous X-ray source in M82

Introduction

Pulsars are rotating magnetized neutron stars. Up to now, various kinds of pulsar-like objects are discovered (Tong & Wang 2014). Among them are: normal pulsars whose surface dipole field is about 1012  G (e.g., the Crab pulsar, Wang et al. 2012); high magnetic field pulsars with surface dipole field as high as 1014  G (Ng & Kaspi 2010); central compact objects's surface magnetic field is at the lower end, about 1010  G (Gotthelf et al. 2013). Millisecond pulsars are thought to recycled neutron stars (Alpar et al. 1982). Their surface dipole fields may have decreased significantly during the recycling process (Zhang & Kojima 2006), which can be as low as a few times 108  G. Magnetars are thought to be neutron stars powered by their strong magnetic fields (Duncan & Thompson 1992). Their surface dipole fields can be as high as 1014 - 1015  G (Tong et al. 2013). At the same time, they may have even higher multipole fields (Tong & Xu 2011, 2014). For an aged magnetar, its dipole magnetic field may have decreased a lot (~  1012  G, Turolla et al. 2011). At the same time, their surface multipole fields may still in the magnetar range (i.e., "low magnetic field" magnetar). Several low magnetic field magnetars are known (Rea et al. 2010, 2012; Zhou et al. 2014).

Accretion powered X-ray pulsars are discovered at the beginning of X-ray astronomy. Since magnetars are just a special kind of neutron stars, an accreting magnetar is also expected. However, no strong observational evidence for the existence of an accreting magnetar is found (Wang 2013; Tong & Wang 2014). Possible observational signatures of accreting magnetars are discussed in Tong & Wang (2014), including magnetar-like bursts, and a hard X-ray tail etc. The recently discovered ultraluminous X-ray pulsar in M82 (NuSTAR J095551+6940.8, Bachetti et al. 2014) may be another manifestation of accreting magnetars.

Ultraluminous X-ray sources are commonly assumed to accreting black holes (with either stellar mass or intermediate mass, Liu et al. 2013; Feng & Soria 2011). The discovery of pulsation period and spin-up trend of an ultraluminous X-ray source in M82 points to an accreting neutron star (Bachetti et al. 2014). The neutron star's X-ray luminosity can be as high as 1040  erg  s- 1, with rotational period 1.37  s and period derivative [formula] (Bachetti et al. 2014). If the central neutron star is a low magnetic field magnetar, an accreting low magnetic field magnetar may explain both the radiative and timing observations.

Model calculations are presented in Section 2, including super-Eddington luminosity (Section 2.1) and rotational behaviors (Section 2.2). Discussion and conclusion are given in Section 3 and Section 4, respectively.

Accreting low magnetic field magnetar

Super-Eddington luminosity

According to Bachetti et al. (2014), the ultraluminous X-ray pulsar NuSTAR J095551+6940.8 has a pulsed luminosity 4.9  ×  1039  erg  s- 1 (in the energy range 3-30  keV). While there are more than one ultraluminous X-ray sources in M82 (Kaaret et al. 2006). According to the centroid of pulsed flux, the ultraluminous X-ray source M82 X-2 may be the counterpart of NuSTAR J095551+6940.8. Soft X-ray observation of M82 X-2 shows the luminosity is 6.6  ×  1039  erg  s- 1 (in the energy range 0.5-10  keV). Therefore, the total X-ray luminosity of NuSTAR J095551+6940.8 may be (assuming isotropic emission, Bachetti et al. 2014)

[formula]

where Liso,40  ≈  1. For an accreting neutron star, the dipole magnetic field will channel the accretion material into columns near the star's polar cap (Sahpiro & Teukolsky 1983). Therefore, the emission of the neutron star is expected to be beamed (Gnedin & Sunyaev 1973). The true X-ray luminosity should be corrected by a beaming factor

[formula]

where b < 1 is beaming factor. From previous pulse profile observations of accreting neutron stars (figure 7 in Bildsten et al. 1997), there should be some amount of beaming. If the ducy cycle of the pulse profile is about 50%, then the solid angle of the radiation beam may only occupy 25% of the whole sky. In the following, a beaming factor of b = 0.2 is chosen (or b- 1 = 5, consistent with other observational constraints, Feng & Soria 2011).

Accreting normal neutron star

The maximum luminosity for steady spherical accretion is (i.e., the Eddington limit, Frank et al. 2002)

[formula]

where M1 is the mass of the central star in units of solar masses. Considering the modification due to accretion column, the maximum luminosity for an accreting neutron star is several times higher (Basko & Sunyaev 1976, denoted as critical luminosity in the following)

[formula]

where l0 is the length of the accretion column, d0 is the thickness. The typical value of l0 / d0 is about 40 (Basko & Sunyaev 1976). Both theory and observation of neutron stars show that they may have a mass in excess of 1.4 solar masses (e.g., 2 solar masses) (Lai & Xu 2011 and references therein). The existence of two solar mass neutron stars may be difficult to understand compared with other neutron star mass measurement (Zhang et al. 2011). One way to form heavy neutron stars may involve super-Eddington accretion (Lee & Cho 2014). Since NuSTAR J095551+6940.8 is probably accreting at super-Eddington rate, it may also have a larger mass. If the central neutron star is a massive one with M1 = 2, the theoretical maximum luminosity is [formula]. For a beaming factor b = 0.2, the true X-ray luminosity is Lx = 2  ×  1039Liso,40  erg  s- 1. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that the central neutron star of NuSTAR J095551+6940.8 is a massive neutron star (with no peculiarity in the magnetic properties). Meanwhile, for an accreting massive neutron star, the maximum apparent isotropic luminosity will be in the range 1040  erg  s- 1. It is very hard to reach a luminosity higher than 1040  erg  s- 1. In this case, NuSTAR J095551+6940.8 will be the extreme example of accreting normal neutron stars.

Accreting magnetar

The super-Eddington luminosity is easier to understand in the magnetar case. Magnetars can have giant flares due to sudden release of magnetic energy. In the pulsating tail, the star's luminosity can be as high as 1042  erg  s- 1, lasting for about hundreds of seconds (Mereghetti 2008). One of the reasons to propose the magnetar idea was to explain this super-Eddington luminosity (Paczynski 1992). The same argument can also be applied to the ultraluminous X-ray pulsar in M82. The scattering cross section between electrons and photons is significantly suppressed in the presence of strong magnetic field (only for one polarization). In order to obtain the corresponding critical luminosity, some average (e.g., Rosseland mean) of cross section (or opacity) is needed. The final result is (Paczynski 1992)

[formula]

which is only valid for Lcr  ≫  LEdd. If the total magnetic field near the polar cap is 1014  G, then the critical luminosity is Lcr  ≈  103LEdd  ≈  1041  erg  s- 1. Considering the geometry of accretion column, the critical luminosity may be even higher (Basko & Sunyaev 1976). In the accreting magnetar case, even the most luminous sources with a luminosity as high as 1041  erg  s- 1 are possible. Therefore, the ultraluminous X-ray pulsar in M82 with isotropic luminosity about 1040  erg  s- 1 can be safely understood in the accreting magnetar case.

Rotational behaviors

The ultraluminous X-ray pulsar NuSTAR J095551+6940.8 has a rotational period P = 1.37  s (Bachetti et al. 2014). At the same time, the pulsar is spinning up (i.e., the rotational period is decreasing). The period derivative is roughly about [formula] (Bachetti et al. 2014). For this accreting neutron star, its light cylinder radius is (where the rotational velocity equals the speed of light) [formula]. The corotation radius is defined as where the local Keplerian velocity equals the rotational velocity

[formula]

where G is the gravitational constant. In the presence of magnetic field, the accretion flow will be controlled by the magnetic field. The Alfvén radius characterize this quantitatively. It is defined as the radius where the magnetic energy density equals the kinetic energy density of the accretion flow (Shapiro & Teukolsky 1983; Lai 2014)

[formula]

where μ30 is the dipole magnetic moment in units of 1030  G  cm3, [formula] is the mass accretion rate in units of 1017  g  s- 1 (the corresponding luminosity is about 1037  erg  s- 1). When the Alfvén radius is smaller than the light cylinder radius, the accretion flow may interact with the central neutron star. In the case of spin equilibrium, the Alfvén radius is equal to the corotation radius (Lai 2014). NuSTAR J095551+6940.8 may be in spin equilibrium ([formula] years). However, its counterpart M82 X-2 is a transient source (Feng et al. 2007; Kong et al. 2007). Therefore, whether it is in spin equilibrium is not certain (i.e., which luminosity corresponds to the spin equilibrium case is not known). The period derivative measurement of this source means that the star is experiencing some accretion torque. From this point, the star's dipole magnetic field may be determined. Whether the star is in spin equilibrium can be checked consequently.

For the X-ray luminosity in equation ([\ref=X-ray_luminosity]), the corresponding accretion rate onto the neutron star is

[formula]

where M is the mass of the neutron star, R is the radius of the neutron star , and R6 is the radius in units of 106  cm. The corresponding Alfvén radius is

[formula]

The angular momentum carried onto the neutron star by the accretion matter is (Shapiro & Teukolsky 1983, which follows the treatment of Ghosh & Lamb 1979; Lai 2014): [formula]. The angular momentum of central neutron star is J  =  IΩ, where I = 2 / 5MR2 is the moment of inertia of the neutron star, Ω = 2π / P is the angular velocity. The change of stellar angular momentum is [formula] (the change of moment of inertia is negliable, Shaprio & Teukolsky 1983). According to the conservation of angular momentum

[formula]

Therefore, the dipole magnetic moment of the neutron star in NuSTAR J095551+6940.8 is

[formula]

The dipole magnetic moment is related with the polar magnetic field as μ = 1 / 2BpR3 (Shapiro & Teukolsky 1983; Tong et al. 2013). The corresponding magnetic field at the neutron star polar cap is

[formula]

For a two solar mass neutron star (M1 = 2) with a beaming factor b = 0.2, the dipole magnetic field is about Bp = 1.6  ×  1012R6L- 3iso,40  G. Combined with super-Eddington luminosity requirement, the central neutron star is likely to be a low magnetic field magnetar. The star's high multipole field near the surface (about 1014  G) accounts for the super-Eddington luminosity. The much lower dipole field (about 1012  G) is responsible for the rotational behaviors. From an evolution point of view, an aged magnetar is also more like to be a low magnetic field magnetar (Turolla et al. 2011).

Since M82 X-2 (the possbile counterpart of NuSTAR J095551+6940.8) is highly variable. Its peak luminosity can reach 2.2  ×  1040  ergs- 1 (Feng et al. 2007). In its low state, the source is below the detection limit, with luminosity lower than 1037-1038  erg  s- 1 (Feng et al. 2007; Kong et al. 2007, different authors gave different estimations). Whether NuSTAR J095551+6940.8 is in spin equilibrium is detemined by the long term average mass accretion rate, which unfortunately is not known precisely at present. Considering the variation of X-ray luminosity, the average accretion rate can be in the range 1017-1020  g  s- 1. The equilibrium period can be determined by equaling the corotation radius and the Alfvén radius (Lai 2014)

[formula]

where [formula] is average accretion rate in units of 1017  g  s- 1. Substituting the magnetic moment in equation ([\ref=magnetic_moment]), the equilibrium period of NuSTAR J095551+6940.8 is [formula]. For typical parameters, M1 = 2 and b = 0.2, the corresponding equilibrium period is [formula]. If the long term average accretion rate of NuSTAR J095551+6940.8 is approximately 1017  g  s- 1, then it may be in spin equilibrium (with current period of 1.37  s). If the long term average accretiong rate is 102 (103) times higher, the equilibrium period will be about 0.2  s (0.1  s). Then the neutron star is not in spin equilibrium and should experience some kind of net spin up. This is also consistent with observations (with period derivative - 2  ×  10- 10). In the current status, both of these two cases are possible.

Discussion

Transient nature

If M82 X-2 is indeed the counterpart of NuSTAR J095551+6940.8, then more information is available. M82 X-2 is a transient source. Its luminosity ranges from 1040  erg  s- 1 to lower than 1037-1038  erg  s- 1 (Feng et al. 2007; Kong et al. 2007). One possibility is that the neutron star switches between accretion phase and propeller phase (Cui 1997). If the neutron star is near spin equilibrium (the Alfvén radius is approximately equal to the corotation radius), a higher accretion rate will result in a higher X-ray luminosity (accretion phase and spin-up). When the accretion rate is lower, the Alfvén radius will be larger (see equation ([\ref=Alfven_radius])). Then the centrifugal force will be larger than gravitational force. The accretion matter that can fall onto the neutron star will be greatly reduced (propeller phase and spin-down). A much lower X-ray luminosity is expected in the propeller phase, as have been observed in other accreting neutron star systems (Cui 1997; Zhang et al. 1998). The transient nature of M82 X-2 may due to switches between the accretion phase and the propeller phase.

Spectra properties

There may be a disk component in the soft X-ray spectra of M82 X-2 (at 4.1σ significance level, Feng et al. 2010). The inner disk radius is about 3.5+ 3.0- 1.9  ×  109  cm (90% confidence level). The inner disk temperature is about 0.17  ±  0.03  keV (Feng et al. 2010). According to the above calculations, the typical Alfvén radius is about 7.5  ×  107R26L- 2iso,40  cm (by substituting equation ([\ref=magnetic_moment]) into equation ([\ref=Alfven_radius_2])). For the standard thin disk, the disk temperature at the Alfvén radius is about 0.15  keV (using equation (5.43) in Frank et al. 2002). For an accreting neutron star the Alfvén radius may be the inner disk radius (Lai 2014). However, the observed inner disk radius is very uncertain. The theoretical temperature at the Alfvén radius is consistent with the observed inner disk temperature. Future more accurate determination of the disk radius may constrain this model (and other models, see below).

Period range of accreting magnetars

From equation ([\ref=equalibrium_period]), the equilibrium period ranges from about 0.1  s to several seconds for an accreting low magnetic field mangetar (with dipole field about 1012  G). The exact value is determined by the long term average mass accretion rate. If for some accreting magnetars their surface dipole field is still very high (the extreme value is 1015  G ), then the corresponding the equilibrium period can be as high as 103  s. Therefore, the period range of accreting magnetars may range from 0.1  s to 103  s. If the orbital period is about several days as in the case of NuSTAR J095551+6940.8, the X-ray observation time scale (tens of kiloseconds) will be a significant fraction of the orbital period. Accelerated searching technique must be employed in order to find out these periodic pulsations (Bachetti et al. 2014).

Observational appearances of accreting magnetars

The discovery of low magnetic field magnetars (with a dipole field a few times 1012  G, Rea et al. 2010,2012; Zhou et al. 2014; Tong & Xu 2012, 2013) clearly demonstrates that the multipole field is the crucial ingredient of magnetars. In order to power both the persistent emission and bursts, the dipole field is not enough. Stronger multipole field (about or higher than 1014  G) is needed. Several failed predictions of the magnetar model (the supernova energy associated with magnetars is of normal value, the non-detection of magnetars by the Fermi telescope etc) have challenged the existence of strong dipole field in magnetars (Tong & Xu 2011 and references therein). It is shown that magnetars may be wind braking and a strong dipole magnetic field is not necessary (Tong et al. 2013). The key ingredient of magnetars is their strong multipole field. Signature of strong multipole field is needed in order to say that an accreting magnetar is observed (Tong & Wang 2014). From equation ([\ref=equalibrium_period]), for an accreting high magnetic field neutron star (with dipole field higher than 1014  G) the equilibrium period will be larger than one hundred seconds. Previously, some super-slow X-ray pulsars are thought to be accreting magnetars (with pulsation period longer than 103  s, Wang 2013). However, this is at most the observational evidence of strong dipole field. A neutron star with a strong dipole field is not a magnetar (Ng & Kaspi 2010). Tong & Wang (2014) had discussed possible observational appearances of accreting magnetars. Combined with the result in this paper, three observational appearances of accreting magnetars are available at present: (1) magnetar-like bursts, (2) a hard X-ray tail (higher than 100  keV), and (3) an ultraluminous X-ray pulsar.

Comparison with other papers

In the observational paper, Bachetti et al. (2014) made some estimations and showed that it may be difficult to explain both the super-Eddington luminosity and the spin-up rate. Assuming spin equilibrium, the Alfvén radius will be approximately equal to the corotation radius. Not considering the effect of beaming, the luminosity 1040  erg  s- 1 requires a mass accretion rate about 1020  g  s- 1. According to equation ([\ref=spin-up_rate]), the theoretical spin-up rate is about - 6  ×  10- 9. The observed spin-up rate is only about - 2  ×  10- 10. In order to solve this controversy, Eksi et al. (2014) and Lyutikov (2014) tried different forms of accretion torque. However, according to the above calculations, the observed spin-up rate is understandable even in the traditional formula of accretion torque provided that the effect of beaming is considered. With only one ultraluminous X-ray pulsar at hand, there are many uncertainties. More observations of more sources are needed in order to make clear this problem.

Conclusion

The ultraluminous X-ray pulsar NuSTAR J095551+6940.8 in M82 is modeled as an accreting low magnetic field magnetar. The magnetar strength multipole field is responsible for the super-Eddington luminosity. The much lower large scale dipole field determines the interaction between the neutron star and the accretion flow. Its rotational behaviors can be explained using traditional form of accretion torque considering the effect of beaming. The counterpart of NuSTAR J095551+6940.8 (M82 X-2) is a transient because it may switch between accretion phase and propeller phase. The theoretical period range of accreting magnetars may be very wide. Three observational appearances of accreting magnetar are available at present.
