Two remarks on the Suita conjecture

Let D be a domain in [formula] Denote by KD and AD the Bergman kernel on the diagonal and the Azukawa metric of D (cf. [\cite=JP]). Let

[formula]

be the indicatrix of AD at z∈D.

Z. Blocki and W. Zwonek have recently proved the following (see [\cite=BZ] and [\cite=B2]).

If D is a pseudoconvex domain in [formula] then

[formula]

Theorem 1 for n = 1 is known as the Suita conjecture (see [\cite=Sui]). The first proof of this conjecture is given in [\cite=B1].

Theorem 1 can hold for some bounded non-pseudoconvex domains. To see this, note that if M is a closed pluripolar subset of a domain D in [formula] then [formula] and [formula]

On the other hand, our first remark says that even a weaker version of Theorem 1 fails for bounded non-pseudoconvex domains with C1 + ε-smooth boundaries.

Let D is a bounded non-pseudoconvex domain in [formula] with C1 + ε-smooth boundary (ε > 0). Then there exists a sequence (zj)j  ⊂  D such that

[formula]

Since D is non-pseudoconvex, we may find a sequence (zj)j  ⊂  D approaching a∈∂D such that

[formula]

(otherwise, log KD would be a plurisubharmonic exhaustion function for D). On the other hand, if ε  ≤  1, then, by [\cite=DNT], there exists a constant c1 > 0 such that

[formula]

where dD(z) = (z,∂D) and XN is the projection of X on the complex normal to ∂D at a point a' such that ||z - a'|| = dD(z). Thus, one may find a constant c2 > 0 for which

[formula]

This inequality and [\eqref=ker] imply the wanted result.

[\cite=BZ] Let 0 < r < 1 and [formula] Then

[formula]

So, the converse to the Suita conjecture is not true with any universal constant instead of 1. However, our second remark says that any finitely connected planar has its own constant.

For any finitely connected planar domain D there exists a constat c > 0 such that

[formula]

It follows by the removable singularity theorem and the uniformization theorem that it is enough to consider the case when [formula] where E is a union of disjoint closed discs which belong to the open unit disc [formula] Since now ∂D is C1-smooth, then [\cite=JN] (see also [\cite=JP]) and the remark at the end of [\cite=JN] show that

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

which leads to the desired inequality.
