Superconductivity in intercalated group-IV honeycomb structures

A large research effort has been lately focused on atomic-thin layered materials and their properties [\cite=Geim_NatureMaterials2007] [\cite=Geim_Science2009] [\cite=Novoselov_Nature2012]. This was triggered by the creation of graphene from graphite [\cite=Novoselov_graphene_Science2004] and also motivated by the belief in many potential applications since thin systems can be significantly modified in their electronic properties simply by acting on parameters as stacking, chemical and physical doping [\cite=Fedorov_Nat2014] [\cite=Yang_Nat2014]. In fact this versatility is an extraordinary playground for searching for new superconductors (SC) [\cite=Layered_Superconductors]. Many (low temperature) SC are already known in the class of graphite intercalated compounds GICs [\cite=Belash_LiC2_SSC1989] [\cite=Nalimova_LiGICs_Carbon1995] [\cite=Avdeev_AlkaliGICs_HiPRes1990] [\cite=Weller_CaC6_NAT2005] [\cite=Nemery_PRL_CaC6], graphene itself has been predicted to superconduct with a critical temperature (T[formula]) of 18 K upon Li doping [\cite=Profeta_Graphene_Nat2012].

Among all possible compounds, those chemically and structurally closer to graphite are the honeycomb lattices of silicon [\cite=Sanfilippo_PRB] [\cite=Bordet_PRB_CaSi2] [\cite=Imai_BaSi2_hiPT_PRB1998] [\cite=MImai_ChemMat] and germanium [\cite=Tobash_CaGe2_JSSChem2007] [\cite=Zintl_EuGe2_JSSChem2004]. For which suplerconductivity upon intercalation was also reported [\cite=Sanfilippo_PRB] [\cite=Imai_superconductor_1995] [\cite=JAFL_PRL_BaSi2] [\cite=Evers_Ortho74] [\cite=Demchyna_Kristall] [\cite=Yamanaka_sp3_chem]. Hence GICs and doped graphene are not unique systems, having a Si and Ge counterpart can be seen as members of a generalized family of group-IV intercalated honeycomb lattices (gIV-ICs).

So far the highest T[formula] reported on gIV-ICs is 11.5 K in CaC6 [\cite=Weller_CaC6_NAT2005] [\cite=Nemery_PRL_CaC6]. This system is also the most studied among the family and its superconducting properties are rather well understood [\cite=MCalandra_CaC6_PRL] [\cite=Boeri_PRB_CaC6] [\cite=Boeri_CaC6-pressure] [\cite=Sanna_CaC6_RapCom2007] [\cite=Yang_Nat2014]. It is particularly clear that an important role is played by the existence at the Fermi level of 2D electron like bands as well as anti-bonding C-π states. It is also know that a sufficiently large intercalation is therefore a necessary condition to obtain high critical temperatures. But what is the highest conceivable T[formula] in an intercalated graphite-like system? Could Si and Ge iso-morphs be better candidates than GICs? We will address these questions by focusing our investigation on the high doping limit, with one intercalating atom per two honeycomb atoms. We will indicate this family of compounds as MX2 where M stands for a metal of the I and II column of the periodic table and X is carbon, silicon or germanium. This composition is known to occur [\cite=Demchyna_Kristall] in several silicides [\cite=Evers_Ortho74] [\cite=Bordet_PRB_CaSi2] [\cite=JAFL_PRL_BaSi2] and germanides [\cite=Tobash_CaGe2_JSSChem2007] [\cite=Zintl_EuGe2_JSSChem2004] [\cite=Yamanaka_sp3_chem].

We will show by means of theoretical ab-initio methods, that finding high temperature superconductivity in these families is a false hope. On the other hand breaking the record critical temperature of CaC6 is likely to be possible.

All systems are structurally relaxed within Kohn-Sham density-functional theory. Upon relaxation [\cite=sup_mat] all carbon compounds, apart from CaC2, converged to the AlB2 crystal structure (space group P6 / mmm, number 191), while all silicides and germanides as well as CaC2 converged to the EuGe2 crystal structure (space group Pm1, number 164). In both, M occupies the 1a Wyckoff position (0,0,0) and X the the 2d positions (1/3, 2/3, z) and (2/3, 1/3, - z). In the AlB2 structural prototype the parameter z is fix to 1 / 2, while in the EuGe2 structure it is related to a buckling (β) of the honeycomb lattice: β  =  (|z - 1 / 2|  ·  c). The EuGe2 structural prototype and the values of β are shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:zplot]. This figure shows clearly that intercalating lighter ions (Li, Be, Na) induce high buckled honeycomb plans, while heavier ions (Rb,Cs,Ba) tend to induce low-buckled plans. CaC2 deviates from the general trend, this structure has a mixture of sp2 - sp3 (75% - 25% respectively) bonding and therefore at ambient pressure it present a finite buckling (energetically more favorable than in a flat AlB2 structure). In this respect, it has been recently predicted by Li and coworkers [\cite=LiYangLing_PressCaC2_PNAS2013] that the flat-layered phase could be stabilized at high-pressures.

As many of the compounds discussed in this work are not experimentally known, in order to assert on their potential synthesis we calculated their thermodynamic stability, this is derived from the total DFT energy of the system (MX2 ) and of its elemental ground state solid (see supplemental material [\cite=sup_mat] for details). This analysis leads to the conclusion that all graphite compounds in the MX2 layered phase are unstable towards this elemental decomposition. While most of silicides and germanides are stable towards decomposition. Nevertheless, since a positive formation energy does not completely exclude these materials from their possible synthesis, we will also investigate their dynamical stability (phonons).

For all systems under investigation we computed phonons and only for those systems dynamically stable, the electron-phonon coupling was calculated by means of density-functional perturbation theory.  We found most of the intercalated carbon compounds to be dynamically unstable, with the only exception of Sr and Ca intercalation. This suggests that the 1 to 2 intercalation is too large for this family and is evidenced experimentally by the reported challenging synthesis of LiC2 [\cite=Belash_LiC2_SSC1989], that turns out to be metastable, partially loosing its Li content and converting in LiC6 [\cite=Nalimova_LiGICs_Carbon1995] [\cite=Avdeev_AlkaliGICs_HiPRes1990]. On the other hand, with the exception of light-ion intercalants, most of the disilicides and digermanides are dynamically stable.

Eliashberg spectral functions [\cite=Carbotte_RMP1990] [\cite=AllenMitrovic1983] α2F(ω) for all the dynamically stable systems are reported in Fig. [\ref=fig:a2f]. From now on we will only consider this subset of materials. In this figure we can clearly observe that the spectral functions are scaled in their frequency by the mass of the atom forming the honeycomb layer. And this extends not only, obviously, to the high energy modes that originate from strong in-layer bonds, but also to the low frequency modes that are dominated by the intercalant motion in the weak interlayer potential. Thus, indicating a chemical effect. We also observe that alkali metals (as compared with alkaline earths) lead to systematically lower phonon branches, therefore to an enhanced coupling strengths [\cite=Carbotte_RMP1990]

[formula]

at the same time this lowers the average frequency, that we conventionally express as

[formula]

From an electronic point of view, all the materials share a qualitative similar structure. As in the case of CaC6 or doped graphene, there are two type of electronic states located at the Fermi energy: anti-bonding π states provided by the honeycomb layer (C, Si, Ge) and 2D interlayer states with contributions from the M d-orbitals. These electronic states hybridize differently along the alkali or the alkaline-earth column and lead to different effective doping and band alignment. This affects the density of states at the Fermi energy ([formula]) and whit it the occurrence of superconductivity, as we will show below.

In order to perform a fast screen of our MX2 set, the superconducting critical temperatures were estimated within McMillan-Allen-Dynes parametrization of the Eliashberg equations [\cite=McMillanTC] [\cite=AllenDynes_PRB1975] [\cite=Carbotte_RMP1990] [\cite=Eliashberg]

[formula]

where kB is the Boltzmann constant. This formula depends on three parameters: the Coulomb pseudopotential μ* (here fixed to 0.1 by comparison with SCDFT results, see below); the logarithmic average of the phonon frequency [formula]; and the coupling constant λ. The computed T[formula]  couplings λ and [formula] are shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:lambda].

In the limit of an homogeneous coupling in k-space, λ is proportional to [formula]. Within BCS theory, this parameter splits as [formula], where V is the BCS coupling strength. In Fig. [\ref=fig:lambda] b) we observe a remarkable proportionality between λ and [formula]. Leading to the conclusion that V is approximately the same on this MX2 class of systems, with the sole exception of few systems characterized by strong softening. Eventually this softening will leads to a phononic instability and to a structural phase transition. Perhaps under different thermodynamic conditions of pressure and temperature. Although not belonging to this MX2 family we observe that CaC6 lies perfectly in this regime [\cite=Sanna_CaC6_RapCom2007] [\cite=Sanna_CaC6ELI_PRB2012]. And similarly does MgB2, however, this is accidental as we have ignored its multi-band nature [\cite=Mazin_MgB2_PRL2001] [\cite=Floris_MgB2_PRL2005] [\cite=Floris_MgB2_PhysicaC2007].

These calculations predict several interesting superconductors and in particular RbSi2, RbGe2 and SrC2. RbGe2 has the highest density of states and, as discussed above, also presents the highest λ, even though it shows a modest T[formula] of 7 K. In fact T[formula] (see Eq. [\ref=eq:mcmillan]) depends also on the phonon energy, which is larger for systems having lower mass, for instance SrC2. Also in this Fig. [\ref=fig:lambda] (in panel a), we included the iso-mass lines as a reference to indicate how the T[formula] in a material would be affected by λ (on X2) or by [formula]. The outcome of this analysis suggests the existence of an upper critical temperature for each family. And this is imposed by the electronic structure, as [formula] hardly would exceed the value of 0.7 states/eV/spin (of RbGe2 ). Following the iso-mass lines in this figure for each subfamily, leads to the conclusion that an upper critical temperature of about 10 K, 15 K and 20 K exists respectively for intercalations in Ge, Si and carbon honeycombs. We firmly believe that this conclusion can be extended beyond the MX2 class, since different intercalation density will not plausibly affect the coupling strength. However, the coupling strength could be significantly affected if σ states were involved (as in MgB2), but this would require an unphysical doping level.

We will now focus our investigation on three selected systems SrC2, RbSi2 and RbGe2 as the most interesting representative of each sub-family. As discussed in the introduction both RbSi2 and RbGe2 are stable towards elemental decomposition. In addition they are also more stable than their RbSi6 and RbGe6 rhombohedral counterparts [\cite=sup_mat]. Therefore, we believe, these two systems are likely to be accessible to the experimental synthesis. On the other hand, SrC2 is not stable with respect to elemental decomposition and turn to be less energetically competitive than its rhombohedral SrC6 configuration that, in fact, has been synthesized [\cite=Kim_Boeri_SrC2]. Nevertheless, since the system is dynamically stable, it may still be possible to find a way to its synthesis, perhaps by means of a non-equilibrium process or by high temperature and high pressure, as often used to synthesize clathrates, [\cite=Toulemonde_PRB] carbon borides, [\cite=CaB_phases_HP] and layered disilicides [\cite=Evers_Ortho74] [\cite=MImai_ChemMat] [\cite=Bordet_PRB_CaSi2] [\cite=JAFL_PRL_BaSi2] and germanides [\cite=Tobash_CaGe2_JSSChem2007].

The electronic band structures of these three selected materials are shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:bands_and_phonons]. The bands of SrC2 essentially differ from those of RbSi2 and RbGe2, due to the effect of symmetry breaking (both have buckling) and as well the doping level of the honeycomb lattice (charge projection shows that divalent strontium donates 1.2 electrons - while monovalent Rb donates 0.5 electrons for both RbSi2 and RbGe2). The Fermi surfaces (FS) shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:scdft] a, b and c, present multiple Fermi sheets with different orbital character. In SrC2 the inner FS comes from interlayer states, while the outer surface is formed by carbon π states. In RbSi2 and RbGe2 the hybridization between interlayer and honeycomb π states is much stronger. The outer FS is mostly due to Si/Ge π states, while the inner FS has an interlayer character, however with a relatively large overlap (25%) to Si/Ge π states.

The phonon dispersion for the three systems is shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:bands_and_phonons]. The overall structure of the phonon modes is the same for the three systems. Low frequency modes present a strong intercalant component, fundamentally due to the weak force constants that binds the M atoms to their position in the lattice, but also because of their relatively large mass. To the scope of this work, the most interesting feature of the phononic dispersion is the behavior of the buckling modes. In the unbuckled (flat) SrC2 compound this mode has 50 meV in the zone center and and cannot falls below 40 meV. While in the buckled RbSi2 and RbGe2 compounds it becomes "soft" moving from Γ ( at 30 meV in RbSi2 and 23 meV in RbGe2) to M (3.5 meV). This mode is strongly coupled in both RbSi2 and RbGe2, and anharmonic effects (not considered in the present work) may also affect the strength of its coupling.

We will now reconsider the superconducting properties of these selected systems by means of a more accurate superconductivity theory than the McMillan formula used so far. We will adopt density-functional theory for superconductors (SCDFT), as it is completely parameter free [\cite=OGK_SCDFT_PRL1988] [\cite=Lueders_SCDFT_PRB2005] [\cite=Marques_SCDFT_PRB2005] and allows for a full k-resolved description

It should be observed (see Fig. [\ref=fig:scdft] on panels a, b and c) that the electron phonon coupling in all these systems is rather anisotropic, meaning strongly k-dependent on the FS. SrC2  has a continuous distribution, while the two FS of RbSi2 and RbGe2, have remarkably different coupling strength: stronger on the small FS around the Γ point and weaker in the outer FS (at large |k|). The distribution of superconducting gaps on the Fermi energy (not shown) follows the anisotropy in [formula], similarly to the behavior observed in bulk lead [\cite=Floris_Pb_PRB2007]. The gap distribution function at T = 0 (i.e. the energy distribution of the SC gaps: ΔkF), as well as the temperature dependence (in a two-band and single band model) are plotted in Fig. [\ref=fig:scdft] d,e,f. Both RbSi2 and RbGe2 show two distinct gaps (like in MgB2 or bulk lead [\cite=Floris_Pb_PRB2007] [\cite=Floris_MgB2_PRL2005] [\cite=Floris_MgB2_PhysicaC2007]), while SrC2 has an anisotropic gap continuously distributed. This gap distribution reminds that of CaC6 [\cite=Sanna_CaC6_RapCom2007] [\cite=Gonnelli_CaC6_PRL2008] [\cite=Nagel_CaC6_PRB2008]. This anisotropy will affect the specific heat and the thermodynamical properties. However, unlike in MgB2, the critical temperature is not much affected by it (less than 1 K). The role of coupling anisotropy on the superconducting behavior can be clearly understood within the qualitative model of Suhl, Mattias and Walker [\cite=SMW_multibandBCS_PRL1959]. The observed combination of a large anisotropy in the gap with a small enhancement in T[formula] is a consequence of the strong inter-band coupling between π-states (having a smaller gap) and the interlayer states (that dominate on the larger gap). The gap distribution of SrC2 is even broader and clearly cannot be completely captured within a two-band model. The system is in fact almost gapless, since the small [formula] part of the FS shows a negligible superconducting pairing as a consequence of the weak phononic coupling.

In summary, we presented a theoretical study on honeycomb layered binary carbides, silicides and germanides intercalated by alkali or alkaline-earth metals. Our superconductivity analysis has shown that in this class of materials are many compounds with a relatively high critical temperature (~   10 K) as well as a quite complex superconducting state. In addition, the stability investigation has shown that several compounds should be accessible to their experimental synthesis. Finally, we demonstrate an intrinsic physical similarity among the group, which can be traced back to their characteristic π+interlayer character of states at the Fermi surface. From this feature we estimate an upper limit for the transition critical temperatures: [formula] K, [formula] K and [formula] K respectively for carbon, silicon and germanium intercalated honeycombs. This limit could be broken only in the unlikely case in which the doping level would be able to drive σ-states at the Fermi level. Nevertheless this study indicates that superconductivity in doped graphite and similar systems is a rather general behavior and many more superconductors may still be discovered.
