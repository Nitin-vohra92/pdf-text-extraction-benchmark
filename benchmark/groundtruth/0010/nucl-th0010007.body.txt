The study of neutral two-pion production through the p  d    →    3He  X0 reaction has a long history. At excess energies Q (the c.m. kinetic energy in the final state) around 200-300 MeV, sharp structure is seen at missing masses of about 310 MeV/c2 [\cite=ABC] [\cite=Banaigs]. The absence of any significant strength in the p  d    →    3H  X+ channel at low mX means that the effect is associated with isospin-zero pion-pion pairs which, because of the available energy, must be dominantly in s-waves. Although a quantitative explanation of the ABC enhancement has not yet been provided for this reaction, a similar effect in n  p  →  d  X0 has been shown to originate from the excitation of two Δ-isobars [\cite=Risser]. The prominent ABC peaks in the d  d    →    4He  X0 case have also been shown to be due to double pion p-wave production [\cite=GFW].

The experimental picture changes dramatically at lower energies. For values of Q around 70-90 MeV, the angular distributions observed by the MOMO group [\cite=MOMO1] [\cite=MOMO2] for the exclusive p  d    →    3He  π+  π- reaction suggest strongly that the π+  π- spectrum is mainly p-wave in nature, and hence has isospin-one. The measurement of the π0π0  /  π+π- charge ratio at CELSIUS at an excess energy (with respect to the π0π0 threshold) of Q = 37 MeV [\cite=Kat] shows that there is significant I = 1 production even at this much smaller Q. The isoscalar π0  π0 spectrum, determined either by direct measurement [\cite=Kat] or through the subtraction of exclusive 3He  π+  π- data from an inclusive p  d    →    3He  X0 measurement [\cite=MOMO2], shows that there is no s-wave ABC enhancement at low Q. On the contrary, there are rather indications that the s-wave cross section is actually suppressed at low π0  π0 masses as compared to phase space [\cite=Kat]. It is the aim of the present paper to demonstrate that near-threshold isoscalar two-pion production in the p  d    →    3He  π  π can be described in terms of sequential single-pion production.

The large momentum transfers required to produce heavy mesons, such as the η or ω, through the p  d    →    3He  X0 reaction mean that two-step processes which minimise the momentum mismatch in the nuclear wave functions can provide the dominant driving force. In one such model, a pion produced on one of the nucleons in the target deuteron is converted into the observed heavy meson through an interaction on the second of the target nucleons [\cite=FW1]. Apart from an ad hoc overall normalisation factor N  ≈  2.4, which may reflect the retention of only bound intermediate deuteron states in the calculation, this approach describes well the threshold amplitudes for producing η, ω and η', though the experimental φ yield is a little too high [\cite=FW2]. This success may be attributed to the fact that the intermediate pion in the diagram is close to its mass shell. We wish to apply the same model to isoscalar π  π production by introducing rather a final π  N  →  (π  π)0  N process, as in Fig. 1. For definiteness, we consider π0  π0 production; estimates of charged pion production in the I = 0 channel will then follow from isospin invariance, after correcting for the pion mass difference.

The principal difference with the earlier work [\cite=FW2] is that the low mass π0  π0 system is in a 0+ state and so there is a parity change at the π+  n  →  π0  π0  p vertex. Parameterising this amplitude in terms of two-component Pauli spinors up(n) as

[formula]

the corresponding differential cross section for s-wave production is

[formula]

Here p and p' are the incident and final nucleon momenta in the overall c.m. system where the total energy is WπN. In the ππ rest frame, k*π is the relative momentum, which is related to the ππ invariant mass through [formula]. We shall neglect the angular dependence of the amplitudes in the present work.

Because of the nature of the two-step process in Fig. 1, only small Fermi momenta are required. Working to first order in these momenta, as in [\cite=FW1], we find that the amplitudes are proportional to the complex form factors

[formula]

These involve integrals over configuration-space deuteron (φβ) and 3He (ψα) wave functions, where α,β = (0,2) represent nuclear S- and D-state components. The energy mismatch ΔE0 between the intermediate and external energies for zero Fermi momenta is generally small for near-threshold heavy meson production in this model.

The relativistic relative velocity vectors [formula] and [formula],

[formula]

where [formula] is the total ππ momentum vector and [formula] that of the initial deuteron in the overall c.m. frame. The component of [formula] along [formula] must be subjected to a Lorentz contraction [\cite=FW1]. The relativistic energies Ei are evaluated at the values of the momenta indicated.

For zero Fermi momenta, the pp  →  d  π+ amplitudes should be evaluated in the forward direction for threshold heavy meson production. The forward direction assumption is also very good even away from threshold provided that pd  ≫  pππ, as it is in cases under investigation. There are two pp  →  d  π+ amplitudes in the forward direction but, at the energies required here, the helicity-zero completely dominates over the helicity-one [\cite=SAID]. Keeping then only the dominant amplitude A, the c.m. differential cross section is

[formula]

The evaluation of the unpolarised differential cross section in this model is similar to that for the production of single heavy mesons [\cite=FW1] and leads to

[formula]

where an isospin factor of [formula] has been included to account for the π0-exchange term in Fig. 1. The form factor combinations required are

[formula]

In order to describe (η,  ω,  η',  φ) production, it was found necessary to multiply the analogous prediction by a normalisation factor N = 2.4 [\cite=FW1].

Single pion production in pion-nucleon collisions has been measured in many charge states near threshold and parameterisations given for the total cross sections as functions of the beam energy [\cite=Hugh]. The charge dependence indicates that the cross section is dominated by I = 0 pion pairs for Q < 100 MeV. This is consistent with the smallness of the anisotropy in the angular distribution of the π+  π- relative momentum for π-  p  →  π+  π-  n, which arises from s-p, and hence I = 0 / I = 1 interference [\cite=Kermani]. Data on the π-  p  →  π0  π0n reaction in the Q  ≈  50 - 100 MeV region show clear evidence for the suppression of events with low mππ [\cite=Lowe]. This is also seen for π-  p  →  π+  π-  n but not π+  p  →  π+  π+  n, where only I = 2 pion pairs are produced [\cite=Kermani]. In the dynamical model of the Valencia group [\cite=Oset], this shift towards higher mππ is due to an accidental cancellation between two contributions, one of which involves the double pion p-wave decay of the Roper resonance N*(1440)  →  N  π0  π0.

Although the production of isospin-two ππ pairs is small [\cite=Kermani], it has to be subtracted from the π0π0 data to get the I = 0 rate required in Eq. ([\ref=e5]) This subtraction is model-dependent and, for this purpose, we have used the predictions of the Valencia model [\cite=Oset], which describes reasonably well the shape of the experimental data [\cite=Lowe] [\cite=Kermani]. A global fit to their I = 0 predictions, renormalised slightly to agree with the overall π0π0 amplitude analysis of Lowe and Burkhardt [\cite=Hugh], gives

[formula]

[formula]

which is valid up to [formula] MeV. Given that x = mππ / mπ - 2, this illustrates the suppression of the matrix element at low mππ, a feature which becomes even more pronounced at higher Q.

Our predictions for the p  d    →    3He  (π  π)0 total cross section divided by Q2, obtained using the same value of N = 2.4 which gave good agreement for heavy meson production, are to be found in Fig. 2. The steady increase with Q is mainly a reflection of the energy dependence of the pp  →  d  π+ and π-  p  →  π  π  n amplitudes; the average form factor changes comparatively little. The solid curve passes close to the CELSISUS π0  π0 point [\cite=Kat], but the broken one is significantly too low, indicating the presence of some I = 1 π+  π- production. The IUCF point was obtained at Q = 0.67 MeV [\cite=Vigdor], and hence can be assumed to be purely s-wave, though it is heavily influenced by Coulomb effects. The comparison of our total cross section predictions with the MOMO π+  π- point at Q = 70 MeV [\cite=MOMO1] would suggest that it is mainly I = 0 pairs which are being produced, though this is at variance with the strong dependence observed on the angle of the π+  π- relative momentum.

The I = 0 mππ distributions expected at the CELSIUS energy are illustrated in Fig. 3 and these demonstrate the shift to higher masses as compared to phase space, which is apparent in the π  N  →  π  π  N input. These experimental data [\cite=Kat] have insufficient statistics to draw definitive conclusions on the shape of the spectrum. It should be noted that the CELSIUS integrated cross section points shown in Fig. 2 are mainly determined by the higher statistics of their inclusive measurement, which was carried out simultaneously [\cite=Kat]. On the other hand, a low mππ suppression in the 70 MeV MOMO data is clear in their high statistics exclusive π+π- production results shown in Fig. 4.

The MOMO data [\cite=MOMO1] show a strong dependence upon the angle θππp between the relative π  π momentum and that of the beam direction. Taken together with the suppression of events at low mππ, this suggests the production of I = 1, [formula] ππ pairs with spin projection m =   ±  1 along the beam direction. Such an interpretation is backed by the group's preliminary data on the inclusive p  d    →    3He  X0 reaction [\cite=MOMO2], which indicate a π0  π0 production rate less than half of that predicted in Fig. 2.

The production of I = 0, [formula] ππ pairs would give no dependence upon θππp, though an interference with an I = 0, [formula] contribution could lead to such a variation. However, there is no sign of any effect of this kind in π-  p  →  π+  π-  n [\cite=Kermani]. Since π+  π- p-waves are so small in π-  p  →  π+  π-  n near threshold [\cite=Kermani], any simple extension of our model to include p-wave production cannot lead to ππ p-wave dominance.

For two-pion production near threshold, the intermediate pion in Fig. 1 gets closer to its mass shell when the 3He emerges along the direction of the initial proton beam and this increases the magnitude of the average form factor. The two-step model therefore predicts that, for low mππ, the dipion should be produced preferentially in the backward hemisphere. This effect will, of course, disappear at high masses because the situation then approaches one of near-threshold kinematics.

We have shown that the gross features found in the production of isoscalar pion pairs in the p  d    →    3He  (π  π)0 reaction near threshold can be understood in terms of the creation of an intermediate virtual pion beam, which in turn produces a second meson. The only way that such a model could generate an ABC peak in the Q  ≈  250 MeV region is if this were already present in the π-  p  →  π0  π0  n input. The parameterisation of the results of the Valencia model in Eq. ([\ref=e7]) corresponds to a parabola in mππ, whose minimum moves to higher values as Q increases. This is due to the enhanced importance of the Roper contribution and may leave space at low masses for an ABC effect at higher Q. The question may soon be resolved, because data on π-  p  →  π0  π0  n at pπ = 750 MeV/c are currently being analysed by the Crystal Ball collaboration [\cite=Ben].

Further theoretical work is needed to include a more detailed description of the π  N  →  π  π  N input, though any improvement will, inevitably, be rather model-dependent.
