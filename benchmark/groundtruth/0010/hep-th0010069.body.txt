String Fluctuations, AdS/CFT and the Soft Pomeron Intercept

Introduction

The understanding of soft scattering phenomenae in QCD at high energies remains a formidable challenge due to their strongly nonperturbative character. The dominant behaviour at high energies (in the soft regime) is governed by the experimentally observed soft pomeron [\cite=pomeron] giving amplitudes behaving like s1.08 [\cite=DL]. The universality of the intercept, its smallness and the precise value remains a mystery.

The recent developments of the AdS/CFT correspondence [\cite=ma98] (for a review see [\cite=ma99]) provide an effective set of tools which can be used to study strong coupling physics of gauge theories. In [\cite=us2] scattering amplitudes in a confining theory in the strong coupling limit were linked, through an identification with Wilson line/loop correlation functions, with minimal surfaces of the helicoid type in euclidean space. The resulting expressions were then analytically continued to Minkowski signature. The analytical structure of these expressions involved branch cuts which, when taken into account, gave contributions leading to inelastic amplitudes with linear trajectories and unit intercept.

In this paper we would like to address the problem whether quantum corrections might modify the intercept. We will evaluate quadratic fluctuations of the string worldsheet around the classical solution obtained in [\cite=us2]. We will show that the term responsible for a shift of the intercept arises by analytical continuation from a Lüscher term. This property is very specific to the helicoid minimal surface which appears when calculating Wilson loop/line correlation functions related to scattering amplitudes.

The plan of the paper is as follows. In section 2 we recall the formalism for calculating scattering amplitudes from the AdS/CFT correspondence used in [\cite=us2] [\cite=us1] [\cite=Zahed]. In section 3 we recapitulate some general features of the Lüscher term arising from string fluctuations. Then, in section 4, we recall, in a modified way for the present purposes, the saddle point results of [\cite=us2] on the helicoid and scattering amplitudes and proceed, in section 5, to calculate the quantum fluctuations around this minimal surface in euclidean space. We then perform analytical continuation to Minkowski signature in order to obtain corrections to the intercept. Finally we give our conclusions and list some remaining open problems.

Scattering amplitudes

In the eikonal approximation a scattering amplitude between two q pairs (resp. between q and [formula]) is expressed as a correlation function of two Wilson loops (resp. lines) which follow the classical straight line trajectories of the scattered particles [\cite=Nacht]-[\cite=Nachtr]:

[formula]

where s is the energy, L is the impact parameter and Ã(s,L) is related to the momentum space amplitude through

[formula]

The loops (lines) C1, C2 are closed at infinity in order to ensure gauge invariance. In the case of Wilson lines one has to introduce a finite temporal length T which acts as an IR regulator.

The above correlation function may be equivalently evaluated in euclidean space, with the lines (loops) forming an angle θ and then performing the analytical continuation [\cite=Megg]:

[formula]

According to the AdS/CFT correspondence the correlation function is expressed as the partition function of a string stretching between the loops C1 and C2 [\cite=loopsads]. In the strong coupling limit the saddle point evaluation gives

[formula]

where Aminimal is the area of the minimal surface spanned between C1 and C2. α' depends on the gauge coupling as [formula] in units of the AdS radius. In a confining theory, when the impact parameter is sufficiently large, the minimal surface is concentrated in the quasi-flat geometry near the horizon. The analysis of the scattering amplitudes in this approximation has been done in [\cite=us2]. For the case of q-[formula] scattering with an IR cut-off T the relevant minimal surface is a helicoid of length T. In a confining theory which we are considering here such a cut-off may arise naturally in a physical manner from e.g. the string breaking mechanism. For q-q scattering the relevant minimal surface is a "tube" formed by a pair of helicoids of length Tint. Tint is determined by a variational equation and tends to zero Tint  →  0 as s  →    ∞   (see [\cite=us2]).

In this paper we would like to evaluate quadratic fluctuations around the helicoid which is the basic building block of the relevant scattering amplitudes. As is well known these α' corrections give factors which are independent of α' and hence of the gauge coupling constant (recall that the leading order term ([\ref=e.strans]) behaves like 1 / α').

The Lüscher term

Before we discuss the case of helicoid let us recall the basic results for a single rectangular Wilson loop of size T  ×  R relevant for the calculation of the static q potential. A flat space calculation [\cite=luscher]-[\cite=arvis] gives

[formula]

The coulombic correction to the linear confining potential is the Lüscher term [\cite=luscher]. Its main features are independence of the string tension α' (related in the AdS/CFT correspondence to the gauge coupling) and a large degree of model independence (universality).

The term [formula] appearing in ([\ref=e.luscher]) is the effective number of transverse massless bosonic degrees of freedom on the worldsheet. Possible massive fluctuations are exponentially supressed in R. For a bosonic string in flat D dimensions [formula]. A superstring in flat 10D spacetime has [formula] (since massless bosonic and fermionic fluctuations cancel out).

The problem of the existence of the Lüscher term was reconsidered from the point of view of the AdS/CFT correspondence in [\cite=olesen]-[\cite=tseytlin2]. We will be especially interested in the version dual to a confining theory. In [\cite=kinar] it was argued that for a specific black hole (BH) background all the fermions become massive due to interactions with the nontrivial RR background and hence do not contribute to the Lüscher term. In addition one of the 8 = 10 - 2 transverse bosonic fluctuations also acquires a mass and [formula] is effectively 7. It seems that these arguments are quite generic.

The helicoid

In a confining BH background, for a sufficiently large impact parameter, the boundary conditions are effectively transported up to the flat geometry near the horizon and it is enough to find the minimal surfaces using a flat metric (see [\cite=us2] in this context, and [\cite=olesen] [\cite=estimates] for a general discussion).

The minimal surface spanned between two lines separated by a distance L and inclined at a relative angle θ is a helicoid, which is parameterized by

[formula]

where p = θ / L and [formula], [formula]. In fact it turns out to be more convenient to use a different parameterization with τ' replaced by τ through [formula]. In the τ, σ coordinates on the worldsheet the induced metric hab  =  ∂aXμ∂bXμ is conformally flat:

[formula]

The inverse relation between τ' and τ

[formula]

defines the new intervals on which the parameters σ and τ are defined, namely [formula] and [formula] with

[formula]

The classical area of the helicoid, entering formula ([\ref=e.strans]), is now

[formula]

The area ([\ref=e.area]) when inserted into ([\ref=e.strans]) gives, according to the AdS/CFT prescription, the correlation function of Wilson lines in euclidean gauge theory (with the IR cut-off set by T).

Analytical continuation -- saddle point

Following [\cite=us2] let us now perfom, staying within gauge theory, the analytical continuation ([\ref=e.acont]) of the area formula ([\ref=e.area]). Due to the nonperturbative character of the calculation the euclidean correlation function related to ([\ref=e.area]) is not single valued as can be seen from the presence of the logarithm. When performing the analytical continuation to Minkowski signature we may not a priori rule out the possibility of moving onto a different Riemann sheet. As in [\cite=us2] we will analyze the physical consequences of such a possibility. In the following we thus have to keep track of possible branch cut contributions. The sides of the rectangle thus become

[formula]

where n is an integer. If we now neglect the log  with respect to 2π (which can be done if the helicoid forms a part of the tube corresponding to the scattering of two q pairs [\cite=us2] or if we assume that some confinement generated IR cut-off for q-[formula] scattering is small enough) b becomes just 4πL / χ (or an integer multiple thereof). Inserting it back into the area formula ([\ref=e.area]) we get the classical contribution to the scattering amplitude ([\ref=e.strans])

[formula]

A transformation into momentum space [\cite=us2] leads to an amplitude with unit intercept and linear trajectory. A detailed discussion is presented in [\cite=us2].

Quadratic fluctuations

In calculating the quadratic fluctuations we will make the following assumptions about the underlying string theory:

the string theory is critical, i.e. conformally invariant,

the bosonic massless fluctuations are described (up to quadratic order) by the Polyakov action

[formula]

We will now expand the action around the classical solution corresponding to the helicoid

[formula]

Since we assumed that the theory is critical, the background value of the metric ab can be fixed to be any scalar multiple of the induced metric hab  =  ∂ax̄∂bx̄. It will be convenient to take it to be flat:

[formula]

We will perform the calculation in the conformal gauge

[formula]

Gauge fixing leads to the standard Faddeev-Popov determinant

[formula]

with the boundary conditions for the diffeomorphism ghosts being

[formula]

at the boundary τ  =    ±  b / 2 and

[formula]

at the boundaries at σ  =    ±  a / 2. The Dirichlet boundary condition comes from the requirement that the diffeomorphisms preserve the boundary, while the Neumann boundary condition is due to fixing the normal direction (see [\cite=alvarez]). We note that the corresponding ghost action and boundary conditions depend only on the background ab metric which is flat and hence are exactly the same as for the case of a rectangular a  ×  b Wilson loop. Therefore

[formula]

where the subscript in Δ1 denotes that some boundary conditions are changed from Dirichlet to Neumann according to ([\ref=e.bc1])-([\ref=e.bc2]). This change does not, however, modify the determinant.

We will now consider the contributions of the bosonic fields Xμ. In general, the boundary conditions on Xμ are Dirichlet up to a diffeomorphism acting on the boundary (see a discussion in [\cite=alvarez]). The Polyakov action expanded to quadratic order gives

[formula]

As we have already fixed the diffeomorphism symmetry we may impose true Dirichlet boundary conditions on all the fields [\cite=alvarez]. The first term gives just the area ([\ref=e.area]), the second term then can be seen to vanish, while the path integral over the xμ gives

[formula]

To this we have to add the FP determinant. For a rectangle with the flat metric δab on the worldsheet ΔFP just cancels two bosonic modes and one finally gets

[formula]

Using ζ-function regularization this gives

[formula]

where ζrec'(0) is given by the expression (see e.g. [\cite=book])

[formula]

In the limit a  ≫  b, the second term is dominant and for the standard rectangular Wilson loop gives directly the Lüscher coulombic potential. Indeed denoting [formula] the dominant expression is

[formula]

with a, b given by ([\ref=e.a]) and ([\ref=e.b]) respectively.

Analytical continuation -- fluctuations

We will now perform the analytical continuation ([\ref=e.acont]) of the fluctuation determinants ([\ref=e.zetdet]), ([\ref=e.detfin]). With the same assumptions as in section 4 we have after continuation a = L and b = 4πL / χ (here we set the integer n = 1). For high energies a  ≫  b and the dominant term in ([\ref=e.zrec]) will be just the 'coulombic' Lüscher term which gives for each massless bosonic degree of freedom

[formula]

Therefore the shift of the intercept is given by

[formula]

Since the superstring moves in 10 dimensions, the generic number of bosonic fluctuations is [formula] which would correspond to s8 / 96 = s0.08333. The arguments of [\cite=kinar] suggest that one of the bosonic modes becomes massive leading to s7 / 96 = s0.0729. The contribution of the massive bosonic and fermionic modes will not be studied in this paper, but they should not give rise to the 'coulombic' a / b terms responsible for the shift of the intercept.

Discussion

In this paper we have studied corrections coming from fluctuations of the string worldsheet to the scattering amplitudes obtained within the AdS/CFT correspondence in [\cite=us2]. The saddle point results of [\cite=us2] were obtained by evaluating correlation functions of Wilson lines/loops in euclidean space as a function of the relative angle θ and performing analytical continuation to Minkowski space. The possibility of analytic continuation to a different Riemann sheet manifested itself in an inelastic amplitude with a linear trajectory.

Here we concentrated on calculating the contribution of massless bosonic modes of fluctuations around a helicoid and performed the same analytical continuation, with the same choice of branch as in the saddle point. The final result for a helicoid is

[formula]

where the (prefactors) can contain logarithms and weaker dependence on s (here we just concentrated on the dominant terms giving a correction to the intercept). The intercept comes out to be 1.073 for [formula] (favoured by AdS/CFT correspondence [\cite=kinar]) and 1.083 for [formula]. In the above it was assumed that the helicoid was 'short', i.e. that the logarithm in ([\ref=e.bcont]) could be neglected with respect to 2π.

It is encouraging but indeed quite surprising that the result of the analytical continuation for the 'short' helicoid is so close to the observed value of the soft pomeron intercept s1.08 [\cite=DL].

The main result of this paper is the fact that a shift of the intercept may appear in a natural way from analytical continuation of the euclidean correlation function. This term comes directly from a Lüscher like term generated by string fluctuations and shares with it independence of the coupling constant through α' . Moreover the numerical value (for the 'short' helicoid) is quite small and seems to be of the correct order of magnitude.

The above results suggest that the 'short' helicoid geometry may be relevant for the description of the soft pomeron, however one has to keep in mind the possibility that other geometries may be more appropriate (like the 'tube' geometry for q pair scattering) which may have similar (but quantitatively different) fluctuation properties, thus pointing towards a different 'effective' number of degrees of freedom [formula]. Also, some ambiguities concerning the choice of a physically motivated branch remain to be clarified [\cite=future].

Finally let us note that the string worldsheet which we considered in this paper corresponding to a helicoid with a finite temporal cut-off is quite far off from the standard picture of scattering of asymptotic on-shell open string states. This might be the reason for the possibility of deviation from the canonical open string intercept of 1. Also the string calculation was done purely in euclidean space (i.e. not in a direct scattering context). The shift of the intercept arose when making the Wick rotation within gauge theory and performing an analytical continuation to a different Riemann sheet.

A number of open questions remain. Firstly, as emphasized above, a careful analysis of fluctuations around the 'tube' geometry relevant for scattering of q pairs remains to be done [\cite=future]. It is exactly this case which is physically much better defined, IR finite, and would be expected to correspond to the soft pomeron rather than the single helicoid. Therefore a lot of caution has to be maintained in interpreting ([\ref=e.result]). In addition possible terms with weaker energy behaviour have not been determined so far.

Secondly it would be interesting to reproduce the above results in a 'static' gauge calculation and investigate in more detail the subleading contributions of GS fermions and massive modes.

A more in depth understanding of the meaning of the branch cut structure of the Wilson line/loop correlation functions would also be very interesting. It is tempting to speculate that some features of this structure may be more universal and stable with respect to deformations or modifications of the minimal surfaces.
