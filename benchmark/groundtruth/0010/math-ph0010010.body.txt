F. Wagemann: Some Remarks on the Cohomology of Krichever-Novikov Algebras, Lett. Math. Phys. 47 (1999), 173-177

There is a mistake in the statement of the main lemma. It should read:

Let [formula] be an open Riemann surface of finite type.

Suppose that Σr is trivializable, i.e. that the algebraic tangent bundle of the corresponding affine cuve is trivial. Then [formula],

in full words,

in the topology of uniform convergence on the compact sets Kn, a function with essential singularities in the points pk may be approximated by functions with poles in the points.

The proof given in the article obviously works only for this case, for an open Riemann surface is always holomorphically trivializable, but the globally non-zero vector field is meromorphic only under the above hypothesis.

The trivializability condition can be expressed as the hypothesis that the divisor associated to the tangent bundle of the affine algebraic curve lies in the linear span of the points [formula]. This is only valid in very rare cases, the points [formula] being required to lay at special places, except for genus 0 and 1 where it is always true (r  ≥  1).

The question whether this lemma remains true even for non-trivializable Riemann surfaces of finite type is - to our knowledge - open.
