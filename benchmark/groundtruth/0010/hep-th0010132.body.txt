Towards a 3D reduction of the N-body Bethe-Salpeter equation.

Introduction.

The Bethe-Salpeter equation is the usual tool for computing bound states of relativistic particles. The principal difficulty of this equation comes from the presence of N-1 (for N particles) unphysical degrees of freedom: the relative time-energy degree of freedom. In the two-body problem, the relative energy is usually eliminated by replacing the free two-body propagator by an expression combining a delta fixing the relative energy and a 3D propagator. The exact equivalence (in what concerns the physically measurable quantities of the pure two-fermion problem) with the original Bethe-Salpeter equation can be obtained by recuperating the difference with the original free propagator in a series of correction terms to the 3D potential. It is not possible to generalize this constraining propagator-based reduction method to three or more particles, because of the unconnectedness of the two-body terms of the Bethe-Salpeter kernel, which are in fact the more important terms and often the only ones to be considered.

A less often used 3D reduction method is based on the replacement of the Bethe-Salpeter kernel by an "instantaneous" (i.e. independent of the relative energy) approximation (kernel-based reduction). In this case, the resulting 3D potential is not manifestly symmetric (i.e. hermitian when the total energy on which it depends is treated as a parameter). In the two-fermion problem, we obtained a symmetric 3D potential by performing a supplementary series expansion at the 3D level and combining it with the first 3D reducing expansion. We found that the starting instantaneous approximation of the Bethe-Salpeter kernel disappears from the final 3D potential. In fact, this potential can be obtained directly by a new integrating propagator-based reduction method, in which the relative energy is integrated on, instead of being fixed by a   δ  -  fonction (or constraint).

This integrating propagator-based reduction can easily be generalized to a system of N particles, consisting in any mixing of bosons and fermions [\cite=1] [\cite=2].

Inhomogeneous and homogeneous Bethe-Salpeter equations for 2 fermions:

[formula]

Φ:       Bethe-Salpeter amplitude

K:       Bethe-Salpeter kernel

(must give   G   via the inhomogeneous equation)

[formula]  Full propagator (Feynman graphs)

G0:           Free propagator:

[formula]

The self-energy parts of the propagator were transferred to the kernel. We shall neglect them here for simplicity.   K is then the sum of the irreducible two-fermion Feynman graphs.

Render the potential symmetric.

The 3D potential   (g0)- 1(  g0 + gKR  )  V0   is not symmetric. In Phillips and Wallace's method [\cite=3], one computes   K0   in order to make   gKR   vanish. Here, we shall write

In the relative-energy integrals,    - GI   cancels the leading term coming from   G0.

Good surprise:   V   does not depend on the initial choice of   K0   anymore.

We made in fact an integrating propagator-based reduction.

Our final 3D equation could also be obtained directly from the Bethe-Salpeter equation by performing an expansion around an approximation   GI   of the propagator   G0   ( →    integrating propagator-based reduction instead of the constraining propagator-based reduction using   δ  -  functions).

We could start with the equal-times retarded propagator.

Following [\cite=4] ([\cite=5] in the three-body case), we could also start by taking the retarded part of the full propagator at equal times. In momentum space, it is

[formula]

The corresponding 3D potential is

[formula]

Writing then the expansion   T = K(1 - G0K)- 1   and recombining the series gives   V   =     < K  (1 - GRK  )- 1  >     again. Note that   T   and < T >  are both proportional to the physical scattering amplitude when the initial and final fermions are on their positive-energy mass shell.

Generalization to systems of N particles.

Our 3D reduction method (as established in section 5 or section 6's way) can be easily generalized to systems consisting in any number of fermions and/or bosons.

Here we shall consider only the case of N fermions. The writing of the Bethe-Salpeter equation and of the final 3D equation remains the same:

The counter-term   K12  K34   cancels the double-countings which would come from the fact that two graphs containing respectively   K12  K34   and   K34  K12   in the expansion of   G   must be taken only once [\cite=6] [\cite=7] [\cite=8] [\cite=2].

[formula]  Very complicated. For [formula] (perhaps even for   N = 4  ) we suggest to bypass the Bethe-Salpeter equation by writing V   =     < T > (1 + g0 < T > )- 1   without expanding   T   in terms of   K,   and sorting the contributing graphs by increasing number of vertexes.
