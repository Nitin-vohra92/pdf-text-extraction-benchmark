CONSTRAINING COSMOLOGICAL MODELS BY THE CLUSTER MASS FUNCTION

Introduction

Recently, certain cosmological models have received a fairly strong observational boost. Several groups have used the new cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from the BOOMERANG-98 (the 1998 Balloon Observations Of Millimetric Extragalatic Radiation ANd Geophysics; [\cite=deb-etal00]) and MAXIMA-1 (The first overnight flight of the Millimeter Anisotropy eXperiment IMaging Array; [\cite=han-etal00]) anisotropy experiments to constrain cosmological parameters. Other groups combined the constraints from CMB with cosmological nucleosynthesis data, peculiar velocities (PVs) and type Ia supernovae (SN) observations. The values of cosmological parameters vary from one set to the next, but all of these models are in reasonable agreement with a flat Cold Dark Model (CDM) universe (Ω0  +  ΩΛ  =  1) dominated by the vacuum energy except MAXIMA-1 with matter density, Ω0 = 0.68 and vacuum energy density, ΩΛ = 0.23 (Balbi et al. 2000).

In this Letter, we compare the abundances of clusters of galaxies predicted by some popular cosmological models with observed abundances. The abundance of clusters has been shown to be one of the simplest but most effective cosmological tools for constraining the models of structure formation. It can place strong constraints on the parameters of cosmological models ([\cite=kai86], Peebles, Daly, & Juskiewicz 1989, [\cite=sim-sh89]), including the mass density in the universe (Ω0) and the amplitude of the mass density fluctuations (σ8) or, equivalently, the bias factor (b = 1 / σ8; [\cite=evr89]; [\cite=fre-etal90]; [\cite=hen-arn91]; [\cite=bah-cen92]; [\cite=lil92]; [\cite=ouk-bla92]; Kofman, Gnedin, & Bahcall 1993; White, Efsthatiou, & Frenk 1993; [\cite=bon-mye96]; Eke, Cole, & Frenk 1996; Mo, Jing, & White 1996; [\cite=via-lid96]; [\cite=bor-etal97]; [\cite=hen97]; [\cite=pen98]; [\cite=pos99]; [\cite=ver-etal01]; Pierpaoli, Scott, & White 2001).

The abundance of clusters and their evolution are quantified by the mass distribution function. The theoretical derivation of the mass function of gravitationally bound objects has been pioneered by Press & Schechter (1974, hereafter PS). Despite various modifications that have been suggested recently (Cavaliere, Colafrancesco, & Scaramella 1991; Blanchard, Valls-Gabaud, & Mamon 1992; Monaco 1997(a,b); Audit, Teysser, & Alimi 1997; Lee & Shandarin 1998, hereafter LS; Sheth, Mo & Tormen 1999, hereafter SMT), it remains a viable model of the mass function and is widely used.

In this Letter, we make use of three theoretical models suggested for the cosmological mass function: (i) the original PS mass function nPS assuming the spherically symmetric collapse, (ii) the mass function nλ3 that incorporates the anisotropic collapse as it is described by the Zel'dovich approximation (LS) and (iii) the mass function nST suggested by Sheth & Tormen (1999, hereafter ST) and later derived by SMT that takes into account both the anisotropic collapse and some nonlocal effects. Recently Jenkins et al. (2001) suggested fits to mass functions obtained in the "Hubble Volume" N-body simulations of some cosmological models. We have checked that using the fits by Jenkins et al. (2001) does not change the conclusions of this Letter. For comparison with observations we use mass functions obtained for cluster virial masses by Girardi et al. (1998) and Reiprich, Böhringer, & Schuecker (2000)

Here we report the results for eight cosmological models. Among these, seven have recently been claimed as the best-fit models satisfying the data from CMB anisotropy experiments ( COBE Differential Microwave Radiometer, BOOMERANG-98 and MAXIMA-1) as well as from nucleosynthesis, large-scale structure and type Ia SN observations. These models are labeled P11, BOOM+MAX+ COBE:I, BOOM+MAX+ COBE:II, PV+CMB+SN, Refined Concordance, MAXIMA-1, and ΛMDM. We have included the Concordance model as a reference model since it is often referred to as the standard ΛCDM model.

None of the proponents of the best-fit models in our list have mentioned the explicit cluster abundance test. Rather some of them claimed that their models satisfy one of the many σ8  -  Ω0 relations reported in the literature, others even did not apply this test at all. We have noticed more than a dozen predictions of the σ8  -  Ω0 relation in the literature, some of which are in conflict with the others. We believe our approach here to present the result of the cluster abundance test is more explicit.

This Letter is organized as follows: in § 2 we briefly summarize the theoretical models of the cosmological mass functions, in § 3 we briefly describe the observational mass functions, in § 4 we outline the cosmological models, and, finally, in § 5 we report and discuss the results.

Theoretical mass functions

The cumulative mass function (cmf) is the comoving number density of gravitationally bound objects of mass greater than M: [formula], where n(M)dM is the mass function of the collapsed objects with masses between M and M + dM. The PS model based on spherical collapse of overdense region in a smooth background predicts

[formula]

where ν  =  δc  /  σM, F(,σM)  =  (2 / π)1 / 2 ( / M2) ·

|d ln σM / d ln M|, and [formula] is the mean matter density. The canonical value δc  =  1.686 corresponds to the spherical top-hat model in the Ω0  =  1 universe. Later it was shown that δc only weakly depends on the background cosmology ([\cite=eke-etal96]), and therefore we ignore it here. The rms density fluctuation (σM) at the mass scale M is determined by the linear power spectrum [formula], where WTH(kR) is the Fourier transform of the top-hat window function. The mass M is related to R as M  =  4π / 3R3. Although theoretically the most consistent approach requires the sharp k-space window function (see, e.g., [\cite=bon-etal91]), we use the top-hat window because it results in better fit to N-body simulations (see, e.g., ST).

The λ3-model suggested by LS is based on the non-spherical collapse as described by the Zel'dovich approximation. It assumes that a fluid particle belongs to gravitationally bound object after it experiences collapse along all three principle axes. In practice it has been approximated by imposing the condition λ3  >  λc on the smallest eigen value (λ3  <  λ2  <  λ1) calculated for the initial density field smoothed with the sharp k-space filter corresponding to mass M. Comparisons with N-body simulations have shown that the threshold is λc  =  0.37 (Lee & Shandarin 1999). The mass function in this model is given as (assuming [formula])

[formula]

ST suggested a correction to the PS mass function resulting in better fit to N-body simulations (for a discussion of motivations see SMT)

[formula]

The parameters A = 0.322, a = 0.707 and q = 0.3, chosen by ST, have been determined empirically from N-body simulation. At A = 1 / 2, a = 1.0 and q = 0, one finds nST  =  nPS.

The cosmological parameters enter the cosmological mass function via the shape and normalization of the linear power spectrum. One of the most accurate approximation of power spectrum fitting formula incorporating baryon density wass developed by Eisenstein & Hu (1998). Their formula has accuracy better then 5% for baryon fraction Ωb  /  Ω0 less then 30%. The cosmological models discussed here predict baryon fraction less then 20%, therefore we have used the Eisenstein & Hu fits for the power spectrum.

Observational mass functions

The predictions of the theoretical models have been tested against the measurements of the virial mass functions in the N-body simulations (see, e.g., ST and references therein). Therefore, the theoretical mass functions must be compared with the observational virial mass functions.

Girardi et al. (1998) provided the cumulative mass functions estimating the virial masses of clusters of richness R  ≥   - 1 and R  ≥  1. Both practically coincide for [formula] (see Fig. 2 in Girardi et al. 1998). This mass function is shown by filled circles in Fig. 1 and 2. Reiprich et al. (2000) determined the cmf using X-ray flux-limited sample from ROSAT All-Sky Survey. They determined the masses from measured gas temperatures based on ASCA observations. In this Letter we use the mass function corresponding to r200 which is usually referred to as the virial radius ( open squares in Fig. 1 and 2). At [formula] the Girardi et al. mass function is significantly higher than that of Reiprich et al.

It should be mentioned that the estimation of the masses is not a simple problem. For further discussion, see, e.g., Girardi et al.(1998), Reiprich et al.(2000), Pierpaoli et al.(2001), and references therein. In addition, there is no one-to-one correspondence between optically and X-ray-selected clusters. There are clusters found in both optical and X-ray surveys, but some optical clusters do not have counterparts in X-ray surveys and vice versa. There are some evidences suggesting that the fraction of X-ray clusters in a sample of optical clusters is smaller than the fraction of optical clusters in a sample of X-ray clusters. If confirmed by further studies this means that some of optical clusters failed to become X-ray sources by some unknown reasons. However, this observation has been made for the ROSAT Optical X-ray Survey and must be taken with a great caution; it cannot be directly applied to any other surveys (M. Donahue 2001, private communication). Here we take both observational mass functions as they have been proposed by the authors without trying to resolve the discrepancies between them.

Cosmological models

In this Letter we discuss mostly flat cosmological models that are strongly motivated by the inflationary model of the universe (see e.g. Ostriker & Steinhardt 1995 and references therein). As an illustration we have included one open model (MAXIMA-1 with Ωtot  =  0.91) advocated by Balbi et al. (2000) and one closed model (ΛMDM with Ωtot = 1.06) advocated by Durrer & Novosyadlyj (2001). Although other groups (Valdarnini, Kahniashvili, & Novosyadlyj 1998 and [\cite=pri-gro01]) have discussed ΛMDM type models, we have chosen only the above mentioned one for our comparison. The cosmological parameters have been obtained from observational data through likelihood analysis with various prior assumptions. These parameters (Ωb, Ωcdm, ΩΛ, ns, h, σ8) from different models are presented in Table 1. In our notation, Ω0  =  Ωb  +  Ωcdm, spectral index n  =  ns  +  nt. In this letter, we have taken zero gravity wave contribution i.e. nt = 0 with zero reionization. Among these models P11, BOOM+MAX+ COBE:I, BOOM+MAX+ COBE:II, Concordance and MAXIMA-1 are COBE-normalized following the prescription of Bunn & White (1997). For other models we have followed the normalization suggested by the authors. models

Summary

We have compared the theoretical predictions of cluster abundance by several cosmological models with the observational mass functions determined by Girardi et al.(1998) ( filled circles in Fig.1,2) and Reiprich et al. (2000) ( open squares in Fig.1,2). In this Letter we make use of three theoretical mass functions nPS, nλ3 and nST. It is worth stressing that in the range of masses ([formula]), the theoretical models differ one from another roughly less or similar to the error bars of both observational mass functions.

At [formula] no model can be reconciled with the Reiprich et al. (2000) X-ray mass function. On the other hand almost all models are in much better agreement with the Girardi et al. (1998) optical mass function. Thus, the resolution/explanation of the discrepancies between optical and X-ray mass functions becomes crucial for the well being of all models in question.

As far as the optical mass function is concerned the Refined Concordance, BOOM+MAX+ COBE:I, and ΛMDM models show a reasonable agreement with observations. The P11 and especially Concordance models predict a slightly lower abundances than observed at [formula]. On the other hand, the BOOM+MAX+ COBE:II and PV+CMB+SN models predict a slightly higher abundances than observed at [formula]. The MAXIMA-1 model seems to be safely ruled out by the data on cluster abundances.

A similar comparison using the sharp k-space filter for evaluation of σM, which is better justified for the PS mass function ([\cite=bon-etal91]), showed that all three theoretical mass function are systematically higher than that for the top-hat filter. The sharp k-space filter approach improves the agreement with observations for the P11 and Concordance models and makes it worse for the BOOM+MAX+ COBE:II and PV+CMB+SN models. The conclusions for other models did not change much.
