Mod p equality theorem for Seiberg-Witten invariants under [formula]-actions

The Seiberg-Witten invariants under group actions are investigated by many authors. In several cases, one can relate the Seiberg-Witten invariants of a 4-manifold X with an action of a group G to those of its quotient (V-)manifold X / G. In fact, in the case of free actions of prime order cyclic groups [formula], it is proved that the Seiberg-Witten invariant of X is equal modulo p to a sum of invariants of X / G, by Ruan-Wang [\cite=RW], Szymik [\cite=Sz] and the author [\cite=N]. This mod p equality theorem is extended to the case of double branched coverings by Ruan-Wang [\cite=RW], B. D. Park [\cite=Park] and Cho-Hong [\cite=Cho]. On the other hand, F. Fang [\cite=Fang] proved a mod p vanishing theorem for [formula]-actions. This is extended by the author [\cite=Np], and in the view point there, the mod p vanishing theorem can be considered as a version of mod p equality theorem: If all the involved invariants of X / G are 0 by reason of negative dimensional moduli, then the invariant of X is divisible by p.

In this paper, we shall prove a mod p equality theorem for [formula]-actions in somewhat general cases. First, let us fix the notation. For an oriented closed 4-manifold X with a [formula]-structure c, the Seiberg-Witten invariant of (X,c) is denoted by [formula], and the virtual dimension of the moduli by d(c). Suppose it is given an orientation-preserving action of a finite group G on X, and the G-action has a lift to c. In general, there are several ways of such liftings, and we use the suffix α to parameterize these lifts as Gα. When the data (X,c,Gα) of a 4-manifold X with a G-action, a [formula]-structure c, and a lift Gα of the G-action to c are given, Y. Ruan [\cite=Ruan] defined the G-monopole invariant, denoted by [formula], which is naturally identified with the Seiberg-Witten invariant of V-manifold X / G with a V-[formula]-structure c / Gα. (See §[\ref=sec:G-monopole].) The virtual dimension of the moduli of Gα-invariant solutions is denoted by d(c,Gα). For any G-space Y, let YG be the fixed point set of the G-action. Let [formula], where [formula].

Our main theorem is,

Let [formula] be the cyclic group of odd prime order p, and X a closed oriented 4-manifold with b1 = 0 and b+  ≥  2. Suppose G acts on X with bG+  ≥  2, and the G-action has a lift to a [formula]-structure c with d(c) = 0. If d(c,Gα)  ≤  0 for any lift of the G-action, then

[formula]

where [formula] are integers determined by the G-index of the Dirac operator and the G-action on [formula]. (If d(c,Gα) < 0, then [formula]. For the other case, see around [\eqref=eq:mult] for the precise definition.

Theorem [\ref=thm:main] can be generalized to the case when p = 2 or b1 > 0 with appropriate assumptions. To avoid a complicated description, we only give the proof of the case of Theorem [\ref=thm:main], and the detail of such generalizations will be left to readers. Other possibilities of generalizations will be referred in Remark [\ref=rem:gen] below.

The strategy of the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:main] is analogous to those in [\cite=N] and [\cite=Np]. We will work out a G-equivariant perturbation of the monopole map. Under the G-action, the moduli space splits into two parts: the G-fixed part and the G-free part. When the dimension of the moduli is 0, the number of solutions in the G-free part is a multiple of p. On the other hand, the number of G-invariant solutions is the G-monopole invariant. However, the transversality is not necessarily achieved on these G-invariant solutions. Then, we give a canonical way of G-equivariant perturbation, which enables us to determine the multiplicities of these solutions.

The organization of the paper is as follows: Section 2 gives a brief review on G-monopole invariants. In Section 3, we prove Theorem [\ref=thm:main]. In Section 4, we discuss several examples. In this section, we give a brief review on G-monopole invariants defined by Ruan [\cite=Ruan].

Let X be a closed oriented 4-manifold, and c a [formula]-structure on X. Let [formula] be the gauge transformation group which consists of automorphisms of c covering the identity map of X. Note [formula]. We introduce another automorphism group [formula] consisting of pairs (f,), where f:X  →  X is a diffeomorphism of X, and :c  →  c is an automorphism of c covering f. Then, we have an exact sequence,

[formula]

where [formula] is the group of orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms of X.

Let G be a finite group. Note that giving an effective orientation-preserving G-action on X is equivalent to giving a subgroup G of [formula]. Suppose such a G-action on X is given, and c satisfies [formula] for any g∈G. Then the following group extension exists,

[formula]

Note that giving a lift of the G-action to c is equivalent to giving a slitting of [\eqref=eq:ext], that is, giving a subgroup Gα of [formula] which is isomorphic to G via θ.

Suppose we are given data (X,c,Gα) as above. In such a situation, Y. Ruan defined the G-monopole invariant [\cite=Ruan] as follows. In this case, the Seiberg-Witten equations are Gα-equivariant, and the Gα-invariant moduli space [formula] is defined as the set of equivalence classes of Gα-invariant solutions modulo Gα-invariant gauge transformations. The virtual dimension of [formula] is given by,

[formula]

where [formula] is the virtual dimension of the trivial part of the Gα-equivariant Dirac index. Note that we can orient all of [formula] at the same time by fixing an orientation of [formula]. If d(c,Gα) = 0, then the G-monopole invariant [formula] is defined as the signed count of the number of elements in [formula]. In general, we need to perturb the equations to avoid reducibles and achieve transversality. The standard argument proves that [formula] is well-defined if bG+  ≥  2, and depends on chambers if bG+ = 1.

In this section, we prove our main theorem(Theorem [\ref=thm:main]).

Suppose (X,c) with a [formula]-action satisfies the conditions in Theorem [\ref=thm:main], and a lift of the G-action to c, say G0, is given. Fix a G-invariant metric and a G0-invariant connection A0 on the determinant line bundle of c. Then the monopole map μ is a proper G  ×  S1-equivariant map. Taking a finite dimensional approximation of μ [\cite=BF], we have a G  ×  S1-equivariant map between finite rank representations:

[formula]

where V and W are complex representations of G on which S1 acts by multiplication, and R and [formula] are real representations of G on which S1 acts trivially. More explicitly, when [formula] is the complex 1-dimensional weight j representation of G, V and W can be written as,

[formula]

The G0-index of the Dirac operator associated to A0 is written as

[formula]

Note that the other lifts Gα are parameterized by α = j where 1  ≤  j  ≤  p - 1, and each Gj is obtained by twisting G0 by multiplication of [formula]. In other words, as Gj-representations, V and W become [formula] and [formula].

First, perturb f0 G  ×  S1-equivariantly so that the zero locus does not contain any reducible as follows: Take a nonzero element v in [formula], and perturb f0 to f: = f0 + v. Then [formula]. (See [\cite=Np], Section 2.3.)

Dividing f by S1, we obtain a section s:B  →  E of the vector bundle E  →  B which is given by

When d(c) = 0, [formula] is the signed count of zero points of s if s is transversal to the zero section. Note that [formula] is G-equivariantly homeomorphic to [formula], where P(V) is the projective space of V, and [formula] is the space of positive real numbers. The G-fixed point set of P(V) can be written as ([\cite=Np], Lemma 3.1),

[formula]

Let [formula], where R0 is the G-fixed part of R. Then the G-fixed point set of B decomposes into its connected components as [formula].

Note that each Bj corresponds to the lift Gj, and

[formula]

When d(c,Gj) = 0, [formula] is given by the signed count of zero points of s|Bj if s|Bj is transversal to the zero section in EG.

Now, let us carry out the G-equivariant perturbation of s. When d(c,Gj) < 0, we can perturb s G-equivariantly around Bj so that [formula]. When d(c,Gj) = 0, we can perturb s G-equivariantly around Bj so that s|Bj is transversal along Bj. Then, the problem is how to count multiplicities of zero points on Bj.

Let x be a point in [formula]. We would like to describe the differentiation (Ds)x of s at x. The tangent space of B at x decomposes into the G-invariant direction and its complement: [formula] Then TxBj and [formula] can be identified as where [formula] is the orthogonal complement of R0 in R. By reordering [formula]'s in [formula], rewrite [formula] as [formula], where [formula].

Similarly, the vertical tangent space Vs(x)E of E at s(x) decomposes as, [formula], where W0 is G-invariant part and [formula] is its complement. When we decompose [formula] into [formula], where H0 is the G-fixed part and [formula] its complement, [formula] can be identified with

[formula]

Let us choose orientations of H and H0 (hence [formula] too), and fix an arbitrary identification [formula] so that [formula] and [formula] have same orientation. (Here, we used the assumption that p is odd.) Rewrite [formula] as [formula], where [formula]. Let L0 be the linear map which is the composition of the following maps:

[formula]

where pv and pw are the orthogonal projections.

We will cancel out common parts in [formula] and [formula] by a perturbation by a G-linear map. We give a local model of this as follows. Let [formula]. We can take an orientation-preserving G-linear map [formula] so that [formula]. Let [formula] and its complement in [formula] be Wr, and Vr  =   ker (L0 + l) and its complement in [formula] be Ve. Then,

Next, we give a local model of perturbation in the direction of Vr. Let

[formula]

Then

[formula]

Note that [formula] and dim Vr  =   dim Wr. We will perturb s around x by a (nonlinear) G-equivariant map ψ:Vr  →  Wr. The next example will illustrate how to take ψ.

Suppose [formula], [formula] and [formula]. Then take [formula] which is given by ψ(z,w) = (z2,w2). If we perturb s around x by ψ, then the multiplicity of x is equal modulo 5 to 2  ×  2 = 4. As another choice, we can take ψ given by ψ(z,w) = (w3,z3). In this case, the multiplicity of x is also equal modulo 5 to [formula]. The multiplicity 4 can be calculated by [formula] in the finite field [formula].

The general case is given as follows. Let [formula] be the coordinate of Vr where [formula], and [formula] be that of Wr where [formula]. Then ψ:Vr  →  Wr is given by

[formula]

where [formula] is calculated in [formula], and identified with an integer which represents it.

The multiplicity [formula] of x is given by

[formula]

By using an appropriate G-invariant cut-off function, perturb the section s around x by l  +  ψ. For every point in [formula], such a perturbation should be carried out. We also need to perturb s G-equivariantly on the free part [formula]. This is easy.

Now, we complete the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:main]. By the perturbation so far, each of zeros of s on BG has its multiplicity [formula]. On the other hand, [formula] acts freely on [formula]. Hence, the relation [\eqref=eq:modp-eq] holds.

In the proof above, the assumption d(c) = 0 is not essential. In the case when d(c) > 0, we can use the technique of cutting down the moduli space as in § 3(iii) in [\cite=Np]. On the other hand, the assumption d(c,Gα)  ≤  0 seems essential to our proof. It would be an interesting problem to consider the case when d(c,Gα) > 0.

Another possibility of generalization is to consider p-fold branched coverings. As mentioned in §[\ref=sec:intro], the case of 2-fold branched covering is studied by [\cite=RW] [\cite=Park] [\cite=Cho]. One could try to prove similar results for higher orders.

In this section, we give several examples.

Example 1

Let X be the K3 surface of the Fermat type in [formula] defined by the equation z40 + z41 + z42 + z43 = 0. Let [formula] act on X by permutation of components. Let c be the [formula]-structure determined by the spin structure, and consider the lift G0 of the G-action to c whose induced action on the determinant line bundle is just the diagonal action [formula]. Then, the G0-index of the Dirac operator is written as [formula]. (See [\cite=LN].) The finite dimensional approximation of the monopole map has the form,

[formula]

where [formula] is the real 1-dimensional trivial representation. It follows that d(c,G0) = 0, d(c,G1) = d(c,G2) < 0, and, by Theorem [\ref=thm:main],

[formula]

In fact, [formula], because there exists the unique G-invariant solution with constant spinor by the perturbation by a G-invariant holomorphic 2-form. We remark that the action in Proposition 4.11 of [\cite=LN2] gives a similar example in the case of [formula]

Example 2

D.-Q. Zhang introduced a holomorphic [formula]-action on a K3 surface X with bG+ = 1 ([\cite=Zh], Example 5.3, due to S. Tsunoda). Let c be the spin, and consider the lift G0 as in §[\ref=subsec:ex1]. In this case, the finite dimensional approximation is of the form,

[formula]

Then, d(c,G0) < 0, d(c,G1) = d(c,G2) = 0. Note that bG+ = 1 in this case, and therefore [formula] depend on chambers. Nevertheless, the formula [\eqref=eq:modp-eq] in Theorem [\ref=thm:main] holds for any chamber as

[formula]

In fact, the following occurs:

In a chamber [formula], [formula] and [formula]. In another chamber [formula], [formula] and [formula].

In the chamber [formula], the formula [\eqref=eq:modp-eq] holds as [formula]. On the other hand, in [formula], the formula [\eqref=eq:modp-eq] holds as [formula].

To prove Proposition [\ref=prop:chamber], we note the next.

X admits a Kähler form ω preserved by the G-action.

Let us recall the the construction of the log Enriques surface S̄ = X / G ([\cite=Zh], Example 5.3). Let x, y, z be the homogeneous coordinates of [formula]. Consider three cuspidal cubic curves in [formula]:

[formula]

Let ξ be a primitive 7th root of the unity. Then [formula]. Let [formula] be the blowing up of cusps (1:0:0), (0:1:0), (0:0:1), and 7 points in [formula]. Then S contains three disjoint nonsingular ( - 3)-curves from C1, C2 and C3. Collapsing these ( - 3)-curves, we obtain the surface S̄ whose covering is a K3. These surfaces fit into the following diagram:

[formula]

where σ and τ are blowing up, c is the collapsing map, π is a G-fold covering branched along the ( - 3)-spheres, and [formula] is a G-cover. Note that [formula] has a G-invariant Kähler form obtained by pulling back a Kähler form on [formula] via τ and π. By blowing down, we have a Kähler form ω on X which is preserved by the G-action.

The positive spinor bundle S+ of c can be written as [formula], where I is a trivial bundle and KX is the canonical line bundle of X (which is also trivial). Therefore, a spinor φ has two components φ = (α,β). Since the G-action on K- 1X is given by [formula] and we fix the lift G0 so that [formula], the G0-action on I is given by [formula]. By Taubes' perturbation [\cite=Ko](cf. [\cite=Taubes]) adding - irω, we have a unique solution such that [formula] and β = 0. This solution is G1-invariant. On the other hand, if we use the perturbation adding + irω, then the roles of α and β are exchanged. Therefore, we have a unique solution with α = 0 and [formula] which is G2-invariant. These two belong to different chambers. By considering the orientations readily, the proof is completed.

In this case, the formula [formula] holds. In fact, the perturbation adding + irω corresponds to a linear but orientation-reversing perturbation by [formula] given by ψ(z) = .

Several actions of higher order G in [\cite=Zh] give similar examples.
