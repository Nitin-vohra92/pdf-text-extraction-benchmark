A CAT(0)-valued pointwise ergodic theorem

Introduction

Suppose that [formula] is a probability space and (X,d) a complete separable CAT(0)-space (see, for instance, Bridson and Haefliger [\cite=BriHae99]). We write [formula] for the space of all measurable maps f:Ω  →  X such that for some fixed point x∈X we have

[formula]

It is easy to see that in this case this actually holds for every x∈X, and that if [formula] then also

[formula]

If we now define

[formula]

then this is a metric on [formula] that is easily seen to be also complete and CAT(0), and separable if F is countably generated up to [formula]-negligible sets.

In addition, let P2(X) be the collection of probability measures on X with finite second moment, in that sense that μ∈P2(X) if for some (and hence every) x∈X we have

[formula]

In these terms the condition that [formula] is equivalent to [formula], where [formula] is the pushforward measure of [formula] under f.

The important geometric property of complete CAT(0)-spaces that motivates our work is that they support a sensible notion of averaging. More specifically, it has been known essentially since work of Cartan [\cite=Car51] that for any μ∈P2(X) there is a unique point x∈X for which the above integral is minimized (see Chapter II.2 of Bridson and Haefliger). We will refer to this as the barycentre of μ and denoted it by b(μ).

In terms of these barycentres we can now define a CAT(0)-notion of ergodic averages. Suppose that G is an amenable locally compact group with left-invariant Haar measure mG that acts on [formula] through a jointly measurable, [formula]-preserving action g  ↦  Tg. Given this, for a measurable subset E  ⊆  G with mG(E)  <    ∞   and a point ω∈Ω we will write

[formula]

for the empirical measure of f across the associated orbit patch of T: more explicitly, this is defined by

[formula]

It is natural to view the function of barycentres of the empirical measures of f,

[formula]

as a CAT(0) analog of the ergodic averages

[formula]

available in case [formula].

In the case of real-valued functions, it is known that if [formula] then these ergodic averages converge for [formula]-almost every ω∈Ω as E increases along a suitably chosen Fø lner sequence of subsets of G. This follows from the classical pointwise ergodic theorem of Birkhoff in case [formula], and has also long been known for many other concrete groups such as [formula] or [formula]. The general case was only established quite recently by Lindenstrauss, who found that the appropriate condition to place on the Fø lner sequence (Fn)n  ≥  1 is that it be tempered: this holds if for some fixed C  >  0 and all n  ≥  1 we have

[formula]

(this is also referred to as the 'Shulman condition').

By thinning out an initially-given Fø lner sequence if necessary it follows that any amenable group does admit Fø lner sequences satisfying this condition. Given such a sequence, Lindenstrauss proves (alongside other results) that for any [formula] there is a T-invariant function [formula] such that

[formula]

for [formula]-almost every ω∈Ω.

In the present note we will show that this result can be extended to maps in [formula] for a separable CAT(0)-space X, replacing ergodic averages with the empirical measure barycentres introduced above:

If [formula], (X,d) are as above, then for any [formula] there is a T-invariant function :Ω  →  X such that for any tempered Fø lner sequence (Fn)n  ≥  1 of compact subsets of G we have

[formula]

for [formula]-a.e. ω∈Ω.

In particular, if T is ergodic then [formula] is just the constant function with value [formula].

Remark  We restrict to separable X in order to avoid discussing the nuances between different notions of 'measurability' for f, but provided the right notion is chosen this seems to make no real restriction. [formula]

We will find that this theorem follows quite quickly from an appeal to the real-valued pointwise ergodic theorem, together with an approximation argument based on a maximal ergodic theorem for such group actions and Fø lner sequences also obtained by Lindenstrauss in [\cite=Lin01]. On the other hand, since any Hilbert space is CAT(0) with barycentre map simply given by averaging, Theorem [\ref=thm:main] does contain the pointwise ergodic theorem for square-integrable maps into a separable Hilbert space as a special case. It seems to be harder to find a theorem about CAT(0) targets that encomposses the real-valued theorem for arbitrary functions in [formula], since the condition that μ∈P2(X) already appears in the definition of the barycentre b(μ).

Theorem [\ref=thm:main] seems to be new even in the classical case [formula], but it does bear comparison with various other works relating probability-preserving actions to the geometry of CAT(0)-spaces; we refer the reader in particular to the proof by Karlsson and Margulis in [\cite=KarMar99] of an analog of Oseledets' Theorem for cocycles over a probability-preserving action taking values in the semigroup of contractions of a CAT(0)-space.

In the next section we will recall the maximal ergodic theorem we need from Lindenstrauss [\cite=Lin01] and derive from it a useful consequence for CAT(0)-valued maps, and then in Section [\ref=sec:mainproof] we will use these results to prove Theorem [\ref=thm:main].

A CAT(0)-valued maximal ergodic theorem

An important innovation behind Lindenstrauss' proof of his pointwise ergodic theorem was a proof of the weak-(1,1) maximal ergodic theorem in the setting of general amenable groups and tempered Fø lner sequences.

Let us introduce the standard notation Mf for the ergodic maximal function associated to a Fø lner sequence and a function [formula]:

[formula]

(see, for example, Peterson's book [\cite=Pet83] for background on this maximal function in the classical case [formula], or Section 3 of Lindenstrauss [\cite=Lin01]).

Let [formula] be an action as above and (Fn)n  ≥  1 a tempered Fø lner sequence. Then there is a c  >  0, depending on the sequence (Fn)n  ≥  1 but not on X, such that for any [formula] we have

[formula]

for all α  >  0.

We will make use of this result to prove the following analog for CAT(0)-valued maps.

If f,h:Ω  →  X are two members of [formula] then

[formula]

for every α∈(0,  ∞  ), where c is the same constant as in Proposition [\ref=prop:max-erg-th].

In order to prove this, we need an elementary result controlling the behaviour of barycentres in terms of the Wasserstein metric on P2(X). Recall that this is defined for μ,ν∈P2(X) by

[formula]

As is standard, this defines a metric on P2(X) (see, for instance, Villani [\cite=Vil03]), and in conjunction with the CAT(0) condition it controls barycentres as follows.

If μ,ν∈P2(X) then

[formula]

Proof  Since b(ν) is the barycentre of ν, for any other fixed point x∈X we have

[formula]

and so integrating with respect to μ we obtain

[formula]

On the other hand, by the definition of b(μ) we have

[formula]

for any fixed y∈X; taking y: = b(ν) and concatenating the above inequalities gives the result.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:CAT0-max-erg-th]  For any α  >  0 the above lemma implies that

[formula]

On the other hand, for each n the measure

[formula]

on X2 is clearly a joining of νf,Fn(ω)) and νh,Fn(ω), and so

[formula]

If we now write F(ω): = d(f(Tgω),h(Tgω))2, then combining the above observations gives

[formula]

and so now Proposition [\ref=prop:max-erg-th] gives

[formula]

and so finally observing that [formula] completes the proof.

Proof of the main theorem

Proof of the Theorem [\ref=thm:main]  Let us first prove the assertion of Theorem [\ref=thm:main] for a finite-valued function h:Ω  →  X. To this is associated some finite measurable partition [formula] and collection of points [formula] such that h(ω)  =  xi when ω∈Ai. This case now follows easily from Lemma [\ref=lem:Wasser] and the real-valued pointwise ergodic theorem: given ε  >  0, for almost every ω∈Ω and every i  ≤  k, that theorem gives some n(ω,k,ε)  ≥  1 such that

[formula]

and so choosing n sufficiently this we can make this hold for this ε and ω and all i  ≤  k. It follows that the empirical measure

[formula]

satisfies the total variation inequality

[formula]

and hence that

[formula]

Combining this with Lemma [\ref=lem:Wasser] and noting that

[formula]

is just the pushforward measure [formula], this shows that for almost every ω, for every ε  >  0 we have

[formula]

for all sufficiently large n, and so since [formula] is a fixed quantity for a given h it follows that

[formula]

as n  →    ∞   for almost every ω.

Finally, the same assertion for an arbitrary [formula] follows from a routine approximation argument and appeal to Theorem [\ref=thm:CAT0-max-erg-th]. Letting c  >  0 be the constant of Theorem [\ref=prop:max-erg-th] and given α  >  0, since X is separable we can always find a finite-valued function ψ:Ω  →  X such that d2(f,h)  <  α2, and hence

[formula]

so since we have seen that [formula] for a conegligible set of ω∈Ω it follows that outside the above subset of Ω of measure at most cα2, the sequence (b(νf,Fn(ω)))∞n = 1 asymptotically oscillates by at most α in X, and so since α was arbitrary this sequence must actually converge for almost every ω. This completes the proof.

Remark  From another simple approximation by a finite-valued function as in the above proof and an appeal to the Dominated Convergence Theorem, it follows directly from Theorem [\ref=thm:main] that the empirical barycentres of f also converge to [formula] in the metric space [formula]. [formula]
