A note on the commutativity of inverse limit and orbit map

Introduction

This note is motivated by the following example of Bredon [\cite=Bredon2]. Let S2 be the 2-sphere identified with the unreduced suspension of the circle [formula], and f:S2  →  S2 be the suspension of the map S1  →  S1, z  ↦  z3. Then f commutes with the antipodal involution on S2. If Σ is the inverse limit of the inverse system

[formula]

then [formula] is homeomorphic to [formula].

We show that this can be generalized, that is, the inverse limit and the orbit map commute for actions of compact groups on compact Hausdorff spaces. The proof of the result is simple, but does not seem to be available in the literature. Before we prove the result, we recall basic notions that will be used throughout the note. By a map we mean a continuous function of topological spaces.

An inverse system of topological spaces, denoted by {Xα,πβα,Λ}, consists of a directed set Λ, a family of topological spaces {Xα}α∈Λ and a collection of maps πβα:Xβ  →  Xα for α  <  β in Λ satisfying:

παα:Xα  →  Xα is the identity map for all α  ∈Λ;

πβαπγβ    =    πγα for all α  <  β  <  γ in Λ.

The maps πβα are called bonding maps. Given an inverse system {Xα,πβα,Λ} of topological spaces, let [formula] (possibly empty) be the subset of Πα∈ΛXα consisting of elements (xα) such that xα  =  πβα(xβ) for α  <  β. It is given the subspace topology from the product space Πα∈ΛXα and is called the inverse limit of the inverse system {Xα,πβα,Λ}. We denote by [formula], the restriction of the canonical projection Πα∈ΛXα  →  Xβ. The following basic results are well known.

[\cite=Eilenberg] The inverse limit of an inverse system of non-empty compact Hausdorff topological spaces is a non-empty compact Hausdorff topological space.

[\cite=Eilenberg] Let X be a topological space and {Xα,πβα,Λ} be an inverse system of topological spaces. If for each α∈Λ there is a map ψα:X  →  Xα such that πβαψβ  =  ψα for α  <  β, then there is a unique map [formula].

We refer the reader to [\cite=Eilenberg] for more details on inverse systems.

If {Gα,νβα,Λ} is an inverse system of topological groups (νβα are topological group homomorphisms), then [formula] is also a topological group with group operation [formula].

An action of a topological group G on a topological space X is a map G  ×  X  →  X denoted by (g,x)  ↦  g  ·  x satisfying the following:

e  ·  x = x for all x∈X, where e∈G is the identity element;

g  ·  (h  ·  x) = gh  ·  x for all g, ~ h∈G and x∈X.

We say that X is a G-space if there is an action of G on X. For each x∈X, [formula] is called the orbit of x. There is associated with a G-space X, the orbit space X / G of all orbits. The canonical map X  →  X / G given by [formula] is called the orbit map. We say that G acts freely on X if for each x∈X, g  ·  x = x implies that g = e. We will use the following basic result.

[\cite=Bredon2] If G is a compact topological group acting on a compact Hausdorff topological space X, then X / G is also a compact Hausdorff topological space.

Let X be a G-space, Y be a H-space and ν:G  →  H be a topological group homomorphism. Then a map f:X  →  Y is called ν-equivariant if

[formula]

If both X and Y are G-spaces, then f is called G-equivariant. Note that the ν-equivariant map f induces a map [formula] given by [formula]. If {Xα,πβα,Λ} is an inverse system of topological spaces and {Gα,νβα,Λ} is an inverse system of topological groups where each Xα is a Gα-space and each bonding map πβα is νβα-equivariant, then we get another inverse system [formula] by passing to orbit spaces. Also, under above conditions [formula] is a [formula]-space with the action given by

[formula]

The reader can consult [\cite=Bredon2] for more details on group actions.

Commutativity of inverse limit and orbit map

In view of the above discussion it is natural to ask, when is [formula] homeomorphic to [formula]. We present the following theorem in this direction.

Let {Xα,πβα,Λ} be an inverse system of non-empty compact Hausdorff topological spaces and let {Gα,νβα,Λ} be an inverse system of compact topological groups, where each Xα is a Gα-space and each bonding map πβα is νβα-equivariant. Further, assume that Λ has the least element λ, Gλ action on Xλ is free and the bonding map ναλ is injective for each α∈Λ. Then there is a homeomorphism

[formula]

We first prove the following simple lemma.

Let {Xα,πβα,Λ} be an inverse system of non-empty compact Hausdorff topological spaces and let {Gα,νβα,Λ} be an inverse system of compact topological groups, where each Xα is a Gα -space and each bonding map πβα is νβα-equivariant. Then there is a closed continuous surjection

[formula]

Let [formula] and [formula]. Let πβ:X  →  Xβ and νβ:G  →  Gβ be the canonical projections for each β∈Λ. Clearly each πβ is νβ-equivariant and therefore induces a map ψβ:X / G  →  Xβ / Gβ given by [formula] (note that [formula]). Also observe that for γ  <  β the diagram

[formula]

commutes. Therefore by Theorem 1.2, we have the map

[formula]

given by [formula]. Clearly ψ is surjective. By Theorem 1.1 and Theorem 1.3, we see that X / G is compact and [formula] is Hausdorff. Therefore ψ is a closed map. This completes the proof of the lemma.

We now complete the proof of Theorem 2.1.

It just remains to show that the map ψ is injective. Suppose [formula]. This means [formula] for each α∈Λ. Thus for α∈Λ, we have xα = gα  ·  yα and xλ = gλ  ·  yλ for some gα∈Gα and gλ∈Gλ. Since λ∈Λ is the least element, we have λ  <  α and hence παλ(xα) = xλ and παλ(yα) = yλ. This gives xλ  =  παλ(xα) = παλ(gα  ·  yα) = ναλ(gα)  ·  παλ(yα) = ναλ(gα)  ·  yλ and hence gλ  ·  yλ  =  ναλ(gα)  ·  yλ. The freeness of Gλ action on Xλ implies gλ  =  ναλ(gα). Now, for λ  <  α  <  β we have ναλνβα(gβ) = νβλ(gβ) = gλ. By injectivity of ναλ we get νβα(gβ) = gα. Thus (gα)∈G and (xα) = (gα  ·  yα) = (gα)  ·  (yα). This shows that ψ is injective and hence a homeomorphism by Lemma 2.2.

As a consequence we have the following corollary.

Let G be a compact topological group acting freely on a compact Hausdorff topological space X and let f:X  →  X be a G-equivariant map. Then for the inverse system

[formula]

[formula] is homeomorphic to [formula].
