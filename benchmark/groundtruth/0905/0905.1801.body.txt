BLACK HOLES IN THE EINSTEIN-GAUSS-BONNET THEORY AND THE GEOMETRY OF THEIR THERMODYNAMICS-II

INTRODUCTION

The interest in the black hole thermodynamics results due to the nice similarities between a black hole and a thermodynamical system. Also the thermodynamical quantities, namely the temperature (known as Hawking temperature) and entropy of a black hole are related to the geometry of the event horizon: the temperature is proportional to the surface gravity of the event horizon while the entropy is related to the area of the event horizon

[formula]

. However, it is still a challenging problem to find any statistical origin of the black hole thermodynamics.

In this context, Ruppeiner

[formula]

first introduced the geometric concept into ordinary thermodynamics by introducing a Riemannian metric (known as Weinhold metric) as the Hessian of the internal energy(mass parameter here), having no phyical meaning in equilibrium thermodynamics. However, the Ruppeiner metric is conformally related to the Weinhold metric. In this paper we deal with five dimensional black hole solutions in (i) Einstein-Maxwell-Gauss-Bonnet (EMGB) theory with a cosmological constant and (ii) Einstein-Yang-Mills-Gauss-Bonnet (EYMGB) theory and the corresponding thermodynamics with modified form of entropy

GEOMETRIC IDEA OF 5-D EMGB BLACK HOLE THERMODYNAMICS

We present the black hole solution and its properties in five dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Gauss-Bonnet theory and subsequently the thermodynamics of this black hole is studied.

A five dimensional spherically symmetric solution in Einstein-Maxwell theory with Gauss-Bonnet term was obtained by Wiltshire

F= -F =

This hyper surface r = r0 corresponds to curvature singularity which may be covered by the event horizon (for black hole solution) or may represent a naked singularity.

If rh is the radius of the event horizon then it is related to the mass (m) and charge (q) of the black hole by the relation

[formula]

(Note that event horizon exits if the above equation has at least one positive root)

So we can write the mass parameter as

[formula]

Now using the entropy of the horizon

[formula]

, the Hessian of the mass parameter, i.e.,

[formula]

has the explicit form

[formula]

with,

[formula]

The transformation,

[formula]

reduces the above metric into the diagonal form as,

[formula]

with

[formula]

As the Ruppeiner metric, the Hessian of the entropy function, i.e.,

[formula]

is conformally related to the Weinhold metric by the conformal factor T- 1 so we have,

[formula]

Thus the explicit form of Ruppeiner metric is

[formula]

The non-flat nature of the Ruppeiner metric suggests that the statistical mechanics description is possible for the thermodynamics of the present black hole. As the expression for scalar curvature (R) is very complicated so we have not presented it here but one thing to note that R diverges at [formula].

Further for a given charge, the expression for the heat capacity is

[formula]

Thus at y2 = 3 - Λx2, the metric coefficients as well as the curvature scalar becomes singular while cq changes sign at that point. So there is a phase transition

[formula]

q+Λ r-3 r=0

THERMODYNAMICS OF 5-D EYMGB BLACK HOLE FROM GEOMETRIC ASPECT

In EYMGB gravity theory, the 5-D spherically symmetric solution obtained recently by Mazharimousavi and Halisoy

[formula]

FF=

T=

[formula]

φ= - 4 q ln r

[formula]

P(r,q)=-r+r(2α̃+3q)+2qα̃

[formula]

p(x, y)=-e+e(2α̃+)+2α̃

[formula]

r- (2α̃+3q)r-2qα̃=0

[formula]

r=(α̃+q)+

[formula]

. The basic difference in the two papers is the choice of the entropy function in the previous paper; Bekentein-Hawking entropy relation has been used while in the present paper we have chosen the entropy of a Schwarzschild like black hole in EGB gravity. In fact, heat capacity shows a significant variation and as a result we may conclude that choice of entropy has an important role for the stability as well as phase transition of a black hole.
