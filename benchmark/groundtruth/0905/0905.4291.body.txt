On the Morita invariance of the Hochschild homology of superalgebras

Introduction

The goal of this paper is to show that if A and B are two Morita equivalent unital superalgebras, then they have the same Hochschild homology (in the [formula]-graded sense, see (Kassel, 1986)).

The Hochschild homology of superalgebras

The Hochschild complex for superalgebras (Kassel, 1986), is very similar to the analogous complex for ungraded case. Namely, the chain groups are, as in the classical case, [formula], where, of course, the tensor product should be understood in the graded sense, while the face maps and degeneracies are given by

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Now the differential is defined in the usual way, meaning dm:Cm(R)  →  Cm - 1(R),

[formula]

and the Hochschild homology of the superalgebra is just the homology of the complex (C(R),d). In particular, it is easy to see that for any superalgebra R we have

[formula]

where {R,R} is the subspace generated by the supercommutators. of that element.

The Morita invariance

We shall simply give the definition of the Morita equivalence here. For a detailed approach, see for, instance, the book of Bass ([\cite=bass]). The definition is completely analogous to that from the ungraded case. Before actually proving the theorem, let us, first, prove a technical lemma.

Let A be a unital, associative superalgebra over a commutative superring. If M is an arbitrary left A-module, while Q is a projective right A-module, then Dually, if N is a right A-module, while P is a projective left A-module, then

We shall assume, first, that Q = A, which is, clearly, projective, when regarded as right A-module. Moreover, in this case we have [formula], so what we have to prove is that It is easily seen, however, that the standard complex for computing the Hochschild homology of A with coefficients in the module [formula] is, essentially, the (unnormalized) bar resolution β of the M, which has non-vanishing homology only in degree zero and the zero degree homology is M.

To prove now the general case, take Q an arbitrary projective right A-module. Then the functor [formula] is exact and the result follows from the isomorphism [formula] established by the maps and The proof of the second part of the lemma is completely similar.

We consider the following family of modules and maps: (Cp,q,d',d''), where where and and all the tensor products are considered over the ground superring R. Before defining the maps d' and d'', several remarks are in order.

First of all, it is very clear that i.e. Cm,n is the group of the Hochschild m-chains of the superalgebra A, with the coefficients in the A-bimodule [formula]. On the other hand, up to a cyclic permutation of the factors in the tensor product, Cm,n is, also, the group of the Hochschild n-chains of the superalgebra B with coefficients in a B - B-bimodule. More specifically, we have where [formula] is the cyclic permutation of factors given by Now we can use the Hochschild differentials to build the maps d' and d''. Let [formula] two given natural numbers. We define now, for any pair of natural numbers, [formula], d'm,n:Cm,n  →  Cm - 1,n to be the Hochschild differential for A, with coefficients in [formula]. Thus, on the columns we have Hochschild complexes. On the other hand, also for any pair of natural numbers m,n we define the horizontal differentials d''m,n:Cm,n  →  Cm,n - 1, where [formula] is the Hochschild differential. From the construction, it is obvious that both d' and d'' are differentials. We will prove now that they anticommute. We have

[formula]

On the other hand,

[formula]

[formula]

An inspection shows immediately that the quantities between the square brackets in the expressions of d'd'' and d''d' coincide, while the signs in front of these brackets are opposite, which means that we have Thus, as we saw previously that d'2  =  d''2 = 0, it follows that the family of modules and morphisms [formula] is a double complex of modules. We consider now its total complex, given, for any n  ≥  0, by and As it is well-known (see [\cite=rotman], from where the notations, classical, in fact, are taken), the total complex has two canonical filtrations (a horizontal and a vertical one) and to each of this filtration we can associate a spectral sequence. The two spectral sequences both converge to the homology of the total sequence. We shall show that in our case both spectral sequences collapse at the second step. In fact, the second order terms of the two sequences are and In our particular case, due to the particular form of the vertical and horizontal complexes, we get

[formula]

and

[formula]

As P is a bimodule which is projective at both sides, applying the previous lemma, we can write

[formula]

As a consequence, we obtain for the second terms of the two spectral sequences:

[formula]

Since, as we see, the two spectral sequences collapse, their limits coincide, in fact, with the second terms. Therefore, as they should converge to the same limit (the homology of the total complex), we have, in particular, that, for any n  ≥  0, we should have i.e. which concludes the proof (the functoriality follows from the way we constructed the double complex).

If A and B are Morita equivalent superalgebras, then they have isomorphic Hochschild homologies.
