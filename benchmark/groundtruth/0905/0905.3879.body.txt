A note on Furstenberg's filtering problem

Disjointness and Filtering

In his seminal article [\cite=Fur67], H. Furstenberg introduced the notion of disjointness of two stationary random processes. A joining of two stationary processes {Xn} and {Yn} is a two-dimensional stationary process {(X'n,Y'n)} whose marginal distributions are those of {Xn} and {Yn}, respectively. The processes {Xn} and {Yn} are said to be disjoint if any joining {(X'n,Y'n)} is such that {X'n} and {Y'n} are independent. Among other purposes this notion was used to study the following filtering problem: if {Xn} and {Yn} are two independent stationary sequences of real-valued random variables, {Xn} being the emitted signal and {Yn} the noise, is it possible to recover {Xn} from the received signal {Xn + Yn}? More precisely, the problem was to determine whether {Xn} is a function of the sum process {Xn + Yn}. In that case, the sequence {(Xn,Yn)} is said to admit a perfect filter. Furstenberg proved the following theorem:

Let {Xn} and {Yn} be two stationary sequences of integrable random variables and suppose that the two sequences are disjoint. Then {(Xn,Yn)} admits a perfect filter.

Furstenberg then raised the question whether the integrability requirement was essential for the conclusion of the theorem. He noticed that the integrability stipulation may be removed if the disjointness assumption is replaced by a much stronger assumption of double disjointness. The idea of double disjointness was then exploited in [\cite=Fur95] to treat a more general filtering problem where the received signal has the form Zn = f(Xn,Yn). In [\cite=Bul05], the authors deal with a [formula]-variant of the filtering problem. But, as far as we know, the original question about the integrability assumption was still open. It is shown here that it can be removed from the statement of Theorem [\ref=mainthm].

Probabilistic Background

From a technical point of view, the necessity of the integrability assumption in Theorem [\ref=mainthm] is purely a probabilistic question. In the course of the proof of the filtering theorem, Furstenberg uses the following lemma:

Let U1,U2,V1,V2 denote four integrable random variables with each of the Ui independent of each Vj. Then U1 + V1 = U2 + V2 together with [formula] implies U1 = U2 and V1 = V2.

Furstenberg noted that "It would be of interest to know if the integrability stipulation may be omitted, replacing the equality of the expectations of U1 and U2 by equality of their distributions," because a positive answer would mean that the integrability assumption in Theorem [\ref=mainthm] can also be omitted. This remark leads to the following problem:

Let U1,U2,V1,V2 be four real random variables such that:

U1 and U2 have the same distribution;

For all i,j∈{1,2}, Ui and Vj are independent.

Is it true that U1 + V1 = U2 + V2 implies U1 = U2?

In an attempt to answer this question he proposed the more general problem:

Given random variables Z1,Z2,W1,W2 such that Z1 has the same distribution as Z2 and W1 has the same distribution as W2, is it true that Z1 + W1  ≤  Z2 + W2 implies that Z1 + W1 = Z2 + W2?

Taking Z1 = U1V1, Z2 = U1V2, W1 = U2V2 and W2 = U2V1, shows that an affirmative answer to Problem [\ref=C] would imply an affirmative answer to Problem [\ref=B]. It is easy to see that the answer to Problem [\ref=C] is positive when the variables are integrable since the expectation of the positive variable Z1 + W1 - Z2 - W2 is equal to zero. However, B. Weiss gave in [\cite=Weiss05] a negative answer to Problem [\ref=C] by exhibiting a simple counterexample with non-integrable stable random variables for which the inequality holds without equality.

We now show that the answer to Problem [\ref=B] is positive.

Let U1,U2,V1,V2 be four real random variables such that:

U1 and U2 have the same distribution;

For all i,j∈{1,2}, Ui and Vj are independent.

Then U1 + V1 = U2 + V2 implies U1 = U2.

Fix n  ≥  1 and let φn be the continuous function defined by

[formula]

Set Ui,n  =  φn(Ui) and Vj,n  =  φn(Vj) for i,j = 1,2. These variables verify:

U1,n and U2,n have the same distribution;

For all i,j∈{1,2}, Ui,n and Vj,n are independent.

We apply Furstenberg's argument to these truncated random variables. Let Hn = (U1,n - U2,n)(V2,n - V1,n). By linearity, independence and equality of distributions, we get

[formula]

Furthermore, since φn is a non-decreasing function and U1 - U2 = V2 - V1 a.s, we see that Hn  ≥  0 a.s: if U1 - U2 = V2 - V1  ≥  0 then U1,n - U2,n  ≥  0 and V2,n - V1,n  ≥  0, hence Hn  ≥  0; the same argument holds if U1 - U2 = V2 - V1  ≤  0.

Since Hn  ≥  0 a.s. and [formula], we have Hn = 0 a.s. Now, observe that Hn  →  (U1 - U2)(V2 - V1) as n  →    ∞  . Thus,

[formula]

and the lemma is proven.

As already mentioned, a consequence of this lemma is that Furstenberg's filtering theorem holds without any integrability assumption. Thus, we can formulate:

Let {Xn} and {Yn} be two stationary sequences of random variables and suppose that the two sequences are disjoint. Then {(Xn,Yn)} admits a perfect filter.
