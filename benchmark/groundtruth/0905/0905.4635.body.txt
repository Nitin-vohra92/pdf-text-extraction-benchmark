depth and homology decompositions

Introduction

Homology decompositions are one of the most useful tools in the study of the homotopy theory of topological spaces. Given a cohomology theory h*, a homology decomposition for a space X is, roughly speaking, a recipe to glue together spaces, desirably of a simpler homotopy type, such that the resulting space maps into X by an h*-isomorphism.

Technically, this is described by a (covariant) functor F:C  →   from a (discrete) category C into the category [formula] of topological spaces together with a natural transformation F  →  1X from F to the constant functor 1X which maps each object to X and each morphism to the identity. Passing to homotopy colimits, this natural transformation induces a map [formula].

In special circumstances we can decide by purely algebraic means, whether the map fX is an h*-equivalence. The cohomology of the homotopy colimit can be calculated with the help of the Bousfield-Kan spectral sequence [\cite=boka]. The E2-page of this spectral sequence has the form

[formula]

and converges towards hi + j(X). If the derived limits [formula] of the inverse limit [formula] satisfy the equations

[formula]

then [formula] is an h*-equivalence. The first isomorphism has to be induced by the natural transformation 1h*(X)  →  h*(F) respectively by the composition

[formula]

We would like to find conditions which ensure the vanishing of the higher derived limits. In particular, we are interested in the impact made by depth conditions.

Let R be a noetherian local ring with maximal ideal mR and let M be a finitely generated R-module. A sequence x1,...,xr∈mR is called regular on M, if for all i, the element xi is not a zero divisor for the quotient M / (x1,...,xi - 1)M. And the depth of M, denoted by [formula], is the maximal length of a regular sequence.

Let [formula] be a functor, defined on a discrete category C and taking values in the category of finitely generated R-modules. Let 1M  →  Φ be a natural transformation from the constant functor 1M to Φ inducing a R-linear map [formula]. Our technical key result Lemma [\ref=key] relates depth conditions on M, depth conditions on the values of the functor, on the kernel and cokernel of ρ, and the vanishing of the higher limits of Φ.

We will apply Lemma [\ref=key] in several cases, namely in the context of Stanley-Reisner algebras, group cohomology, invariant theory and algebras over the Steenrod algebra. In fact, with a little extra work, one could prove that the first three examples are nothing but specialization of the last one. In all cases we will describe the algebraic object in question as the inverse limit of a functor defined on a finite category. The first two application have a topological background in terms of homology decompositions.

(Stanley-Reisner algebras) The main invariant to study the combinatorics of an abstract simplicial complex K is the associated face ring respectively Stanley-Reisner algebra [formula] ([formula] a field), which is a quotient of a polynomial algebra generated by the vertices of the complex. Let (K×) denote the category given by the non-empty faces of K Then, [formula] can be described as the inverse limit of a functor [formula] from the category (K×) given by the non-empty faces of K into the category of [formula]-algebras. In fact, for a face σ∈K, we define [formula], where [formula] denotes the star of σ (see Section [\ref=stanreis]). This algebraic setting has a topological realization. There exists a space c(K) such that [formula] as well as a functor FK:(K×)op  →   defined by [formula] and a natural transformation FK  →  1c(K) such that [formula] and such that [formula] is a cofibration [\cite=notopint](see also Section [\ref=stanreis]).

Properties of commutative algebra for [formula] are reflected in the geometry or combinatorics of the underlying simplicial complex. For example, Reisner proved such a theorem for the Cohen-Macaulay property [\cite=reisner]. With our methods we are able to reprove this result. Actually, we will get a slight generalization and characterize the depth of the face ring by the cohomological connectivity of the links of the faces of K (Theorem [\ref=mainsr]). This generalization is already at least implicitly contained in Reisner's work (see also [\cite=brun]).

(group cohomology) For a compact Lie group G and a fixed prime p, we denote by Fp(G) the Frobenius or Quillen category of G [\cite=quillen]. The objects are given by the non-trivial elementary abelian p-subgroups E  ⊂  G and the morphism are all monomorphism E  →  E' induced by conjugation by an element of G. For an object E∈Fp(G) we denote by BCG(E) the classifying space of the centralizer CG(E) of E. These assignments fit together to establish a functor FG:Fp(G)op  →  . The inclusions CG(E)  ⊂  G establish a natural transformation FG  →  1BG and the map [formula] induces an isomorphism in mod-p cohomology. Passing to mod-p cohomology gives rise to a functor [formula] defined by [formula] and to a natural transformation [formula], which induces an isomorphism [formula]. All these facts can be found in [\cite=jm] and in [\cite=dwcendec]. We will show that [formula] equals the minimum of the numbers [formula] taken over all objects in Fp(G) (Theorem [\ref=maingroupcohomology]).

(polynomial invariants) For a finite dimensional [formula]-vector space V and a representation [formula] of a finite group G, we denote by [formula] the ring of polynomial invariants of the G-action on the symmetric algebra [formula] of the dual of V. Let S denote the collection of all point wise stabilizer subgroups of non trivial subspaces of V whose order is divisible by p. Let O(G) denote the orbit category of G. That is objects are given by quotients G / H, H  ⊂  G a subgroup, and the morphisms by G-equivariant maps. Let OS(G)  ⊂  O(G) denote the full subcategory of the orbit category, whose objects are given by quotients G / H such that H∈S. There exists a functor [formula] and a natural transformation [formula]. If p divides the order of G, then this natural transformation establishes an isomorphism [formula] [\cite=nodecrep]. In this case, we will show that [formula] equals the minimum of the numbers [formula] taken over all subgroups H  ⊂  G contained in S (Theorem [\ref=maininv]). If p does not divide the order of G, then [formula] is Cohen-Macaulay, i.e. [formula] equals the dimension of V [\cite=nesm].

The inequality [formula] for H∈S was already proven by Kemper [\cite=kemper] as well as by Smith (see [\cite=nesm]).

(algebraic centralizer decomposition) The second and third example and the first in the case of [formula] can be interpreted as a specialization of a more general statement concerning algebras over the Steenrod algebra. We can think of this last example as an algebraic centralizer decomposition for algebras over the Steenrod algebra.

Let p be a fixed prime. Let A denote the mod-p Steenrod algebra and K the category of unstable algebras over A. Let A be a noetherian object of K. i.e. A is noetherian just as algebra. Rector constructed a category F(A), whose objects (E,φ) consist of a non-trivial elementary abelian p-group E and a K-morphism [formula] into the mod-p cohomology of the classifying space BE of E, such that φ makes HE to a finitely generated A-module [\cite=rector]. With the help of Lannes' T-functor [\cite=lannes], one can construct a functor ΦA:F(A)  →  K and a natural transformation 1A  →  φA respectively a map [formula] (see Section [\ref=algcendec]). We will establish a relation between the depth of A respectively of the functor values and the vanishing of the higher limits (Theorem [\ref=maincen]).

Besides Lemma [\ref=key] there is one further input in all four examples. In all four cases it turns out that depth conditions on [formula], [formula], [formula] or on A are inherited to the functor values of the associated functor. This is a consequence of Theorem [\ref=depthincrease], which states that an application of Lannes' T-functor may only increase the depth.

The paper is organized as follows. In the next section we establish our technical key result. In Section [\ref=depthtfunctor] we analyse the relation between depth and Lannes' T-functor. This passes the way to discuss the case of algebraic centralizer decompositions (Section [\ref=algcendec]), the case of group cohomology (Section [\ref=groupcohomology]), the case of polynomial invariants (Section [\ref=polyinv]) and, finally, the case of Stanley-Reisner algebras (Section [\ref=stanreis]).

The key lemma

Let [formula] be a field. To simplify the discussion and since all applications are covered, we suppose that R is either a commutative local noetherian ring with maximal ideal mR and residue field [formula] or or a connected commutative graded noetherian [formula]-algebra. In the graded case, that is that Ri = 0 for i < 0 and [formula]. In particular, R is a also a graded local ring with residue field [formula]. The maximal ideal [formula] is the set of elements of positive degree. In the graded case, the depth of M is defined as the maximal length of a sequence of homogeneous elements in R which is regular on M. Let [formula] denote the category of finitely generated R-modules respectively the category of finitely generated non-negatively graded R-modules. Let [formula] be a covariant functor defined on a discrete category C. Let M be an object of [formula] and 1M  →  Φ a natural transformation from the constant functor 1M to Φ. This establishes a R-linear map ρ:M  →   lim C  Φ. We measure the vanishing of the higher derived limits and the deviation of ρ being an isomorphism by the R-modules [formula], i  ≥   - 1. That is L- 1 is the kernel and L0 the cokernel of ρ. And [formula] for i  ≥  1.

Higher derived limits of the functor Φ can be defined as the cohomology groups of a certain cochain complex (C*(C,Φ),δ) over R (for details see [\cite=oliver]). For n  ≥  0, the R-module [formula] is defined as

[formula]

The differential δ:Cn  →  Cn + 1 is given by the alternating sum [formula] where δk is defined on u∈Cn by

[formula]

In particular, δk as well as δ are R-linear, and all the groups Li are in a natural way finitely generated R-modules.

We fix all the above notation through out this section. We say that the sequence Li, i  ≥   - 1, is almost trivial if, for all i  ≥   - 1, either Li = 0 or [formula]. The following result is the key lemma for proving our main results.

Let [formula] be a functor. Suppose that [formula] for all objects c∈C and that the sequence Li, i  ≥   - 1, is almost trivial. Then, [formula] if and only if Li = 0 for i  ≤  r - 2.

The rest of this section is devoted to a proof of this lemma. The proof is based on spectral sequences associated to double complexes. To fix notation we recall the basic concept. Details may be found in [\cite=weibel].

A double complex over R or a differential bigraded R-module (D* , *,dh,dv) is a bigraded R- module D* , * with two R-linear maps dh:D* , *  →  D*  + 1, * and dv:D* , *  →  D* , *  + 1 of bidegree (1,0) and (0,1) such that dhdh = 0 = dvdv and dhdv + dvdh = 0. We think of dh as the horizontal and of dv as the vertical differential. To each double complex D* , * we associate a total complex Tot*(D) which is a differential graded R-module defined by [formula] with differential [formula].

If B* is a chain complex and C* a cochain complex over R then [formula] can be made into a bigraded R-module. We define [formula], [formula] and [formula] for dh:Di, *  →  Di + 1, *.

For a double complex (D* , *,dh,dv), we can take horizontal or vertical cohomology groups denoted by H*h(D* , *) and H*v(D* , *). The boundary maps dv and dh induce again boundary maps on these cohomology groups. We can consider cohomology groups of the form H*h(H*v(D* , *)) and H*v(H*h(D* , *)).

If Di,j = 0 for i < 0 or j < 0, there exist two spectral sequences converging towards H*(Tot(D),d). In one case, we have [formula] and in the other case [formula]. In the first case the differentials on the Er-page have degree (1 - r,r) and in the second case degree (r,1 - r).

Proof of Lemma [\ref=key]: Since R is local, the depth of a finitely generated R-module N is characterized by the smallest number j, such that [formula] [\cite=weibel]. Hence, we have to relate certain [formula]-groups.

If r = 0 there is nothing to show since each R-module has depth ≥  0. If r = 1 we have an exact sequence

[formula]

Hence, since L- 1 = 0 or [formula], we have [formula] if and only if [formula] if and only if L- 1 = 0. This proves the statement for r = 1.

Now we assume that [formula]. In particular, L- 1 = 0. We want to show that Li = 0 for i  ≤  r - 2. Let Q* be a R-projective resolution of [formula] as R-module, let [formula] and let D* , * denote the differential bigraded R-module [formula]. Since D* , * is concentrated in the first quadrant, both spectral sequences converge towards [formula]. We have

[formula]

which vanishes for j  ≤  r - 1. On the other hand, we have

[formula]

The long exact sequence of [formula]-groups for the short exact sequence

[formula]

shows that [formula] for i  ≤  r - 2.

By degree reasons and since no differential starts or ends at [formula], this group has to vanish. Since L0 = 0 or [formula], this shows that L0 = 0, that [formula] and that [formula] for j < r. We can repeat the argument successively for i = 1...,r - 2, which implies that Li = 0 for i  ≤  r - 2. Since there might be a non-trivial differential

[formula]

we cannot repeat the argument further.

If Li = 0 for i  ≤  r - 2, the E2-page of first spectral sequence is exactly the same, but may fail the vanishing statement. Since [formula], the E2-page of the second spectral sequence satisfies the equations

[formula]

A similar degree argument shows that [formula] for j  ≤  r - 1 and that [formula]. This finishes the proof.

Lemma [\ref=key] can be slighly generalized. If you assume that either Li = 0 or [formula] for all i, then a modification of the above argument will show that [formula] if and only if Li = 0 for i  ≤  r - s - 2.

We also will apply Lemma [\ref=key] in form of the following corollary.

If Li = 0 for all i  ≥   - 1 then [formula].

Depth and the T-functor

To fix notation we recall some basic concepts from T-functor technology. For more details see [\cite=schwartz] and [\cite=lannes]

Let p be a fixed prime. As already mentioned in the introduction, A denotes the mod-p Steenrod algebra, U the category of unstable modules and K the category of unstable algebras over A.

For an elementary abelian p-group E we denote by [formula] the mod-p cohomology of the classifying space BE. The functor [formula] has a left adjoint in U denoted by TE:U  →  U. This functor is exact, commutes with tensor products and restricts therefore to a functor TE:K  →  K also denoted by TE. The adjoint of [formula] establishes a map [formula] and, projecting to the first factor via the augmentation [formula], a map e:M  →  TE(M).

We can specialize further. For an algebra A∈K we denote by A   -   U the category of [formula]-modules. An [formula]-module is both, an object M∈U and an A-module such that the structure map [formula] is A-linear. Here, A acts on the tensor product via the Cartan formula. We also denote by Afg   -   U  ⊂  A   -   U the full subcategory of all objects which are finitely generated as A-modules.

If M∈A   -   U, then, since the functor TE commutes with tensor products, the U-object TE(M) is actually an object of TE(A)   -   U. And if φ:A  →  HE is a K-map, we define [formula], where [formula] denotes the TE(A)-module whose structure map is induced by the adjoint of the K-map φ:A  →  HE.

Let F(n)∈U denote the free object in U generated by one element in degree n. The module F(n) is defined by the equation [formula] for any object M∈U. Here, Mn denotes the set of elements of M of degree n (for details see [\cite=schwartz]). For any object M∈A   -   U, we have [formula]. Therefore, there exists an A   -   U-epimorphism P  →  M such that P is free as A-module as well as a resolution

[formula]

of A   -   U-modules, such that each Pi is free as A-module.

In the following we assume that A is noetherian as an algebra, which simplifies the discussion. In particular, [formula] is a finite set and [formula] is a finite dimensional vector space isomorphic to the dual of [formula]. And, if M∈A   -   U, then

[formula]

The above map e:M  →  TE(M) respects all these additional structures and, restricting to a particular summand of TE(M), establishes a map eφ:M  →  M(φ). This is a map of A-modules, where A acts on M(φ) via the K-map A  →  A(φ), and therefore a A   -   U-morphism. In fact, if A∈K is noetherian and A  →  HE a K-map, then the functor TE( - ,φ) restricts to a functor TE( - ,φ):Afg   -   U  →  Afg   -   U [\cite=henn]. In particular, if A is noetherian, so is [formula].

In this section we want to prove the following theorem.

Let A∈K be a noetherian connected algebra and M∈Afg   -   U. Let E be an elementary abelian group and let φ:A  →  HE be a K-map. Then, [formula].

The proof of this theorem is very similar to an argument used by Smith in a different context (see [\cite=nesm]).

Using the Auslander Buchsbaum equation (e.g see [\cite=weibel]) we will reduce this statement to a claim about homological dimension.

Let A be a connected commutative graded algebra and M a graded A-module. We say that M has finite homological dimension if there exists a finite resolution

[formula]

of graded A-modules, such that Pi is projective for 0  ≤  i  ≤  r. We say that [formula] if the shortest projective resolution has length t.

Let A be a noetherian object of K, M and object of A   -   U, and φ:A  →  HE a K-map. If M has finite homological dimension over A, then M(φ) has finite homological dimension over A(φ)and [formula].

Let [formula]. We can choose a resolution

[formula]

of A   -   U-moduls, such that Pi is free as A-module for 0  ≤  i  ≤  t - 1. Since [formula], this implies that Pt is a projective A-module. And since A is connected and noetherian, in particular a graded local ring ring, Pt is a free A-module. In Weibel 4.3.11 this claim is stated for finitely generated projective modules. The proof is based on the Nakayam lemma (weibel 4.3.9) which is only stated for finitely generated modules, but in the graded context, this can be easily generalized to genral modules, no finiteness condition. We have to show, that M = A+M implies M = 0. But this is obvious, since elements of A+ have degree ≥ 1.[formula]T(-,φ)establishesanexactA(φ)-U- sequence0  →  Pt(φ)  →  Pt - 1(φ)  →  ...  →  P0(φ)  →  M(φ)  →  0.LannesT[formula]i,themoduleP(φ)isafreeA(φ)- module,whichprovestheclaim.

The proof of Theorem [\ref=depthincrease] needs some further preparation. Let α:A  →  B and φ:A  →  HE be K-maps, A and B noetherian. We denote by e(φ,α) the set of all K maps ψ:B  →  HE such that ψα  =  φ. This is a finite set.

Let α:A  →  B and φ:A  →  HE as above. For each object M of B   -   U, the T-functor induces an A   -   U-isomorphism [formula].

The algebra A acts on B(ψ) via the composition A  →  B  →  B(ψ) of K-maps. Since [formula] as algebras, we have

[formula]

And this composition is obviously a map of A-modules.

The Dickson algebra [formula] is a polynomial algebra isomorphic to the invariants of the general linear group [formula] acting on the polynomial algebra [formula] with r-generators, which we give the degree 2. Then, this algebra carries an action of A which inherits an action to Dr. More details can be found in [\cite=nesm].

For a positive integer l we denote by Dlr  ⊂  Dr the subalgebra of all pl-powers of elements of Dr. Then, [formula] is again a polynomial algebra , in particular a noetherian object of K [\cite=schwartz].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=depthincrease]: Since A is noetherian, there exist integers n,l  ≥  1 and a K map [formula] making A into a finitely generated D-module [\cite=boza]. Hence, M is a finitely generated D-module as well, and for the calculation of [formula] we can consider M as an D-module [\cite=serre]. On the other hand, for each K-map φ:A  →  HE, we have [formula] as D-modules. Since φ∈e(φα,α), we have [formula]. Hence, we can and will assume that A = D.

Since D is a polynomial algebra, every finitely generated D-module has finite homological dimension (see [\cite=weibel]). By Proposition [\ref=homdimdecrease] we have [formula]. Since D is a polynomial algebra, the same holds for D(φ) and D(φ) is a free finitely generated D-module [\cite=dwkaehler]. In particular, every projective D(φ)-module is a projective D-module and [formula] By the Auslander-Buchsbaum equation (see [\cite=weibel]), we have [formula] for any finitely generated D-module N. Proposition [\ref=homdimdecrease] shows that [formula]. .

Depth and the algebraic centralizer decomposition

We use the same notation as in the last section. For a noetherian object A∈K, Rector defined a category F(A) as follows [\cite=rector]. The objects are given by pairs (E,φ), where E is a non-trivial elementary abelian p-group and where φ:A  →  HE is a K-map such that HE becomes a finitely generated A-module. And a morphism α:(E,φ)  →  (E',φ') is a monomorphism iα:E  →  E' such that φH*(Biα) = φ'. Since A is noetherian, this category is finite.

Let M be an object of A   -   U. Since the T-functor its natural with respect to homomorphism E  →  E', the maps eφ:M  →  M(φ) are compatible with all morphisms in the category F(A). This defines a covariant functor

[formula]

as well as a natural transformation 1M  →  ΦM. In particular, there exists an A   -   U-morphism

[formula]

For a topological interpretation of these algebraic data and their relation to centralizer decompositions of compact Lie groups see [\cite=dwcendec] (see also Section [\ref=groupcohomology]).

As in Section [\ref=keylemma], we define

[formula]

Let A∈K be a connected noetherian algebra and let M be an object of Afg   -   U. Then, [formula] if and only if the following two conditions hold: (i) For all objects (E,φ)∈F(A), we have [formula]. (ii) Li(M) = 0 for i  ≤  r - 2

In [\cite=henn], Henn has shown that the A-modules Li are finite dimensional [formula]-vector spaces. In particular, either Li(M) = 0 or [formula] for all i  ≥   - 1. That is, the sequence {Li:i  ≥   - 1} is almost trivial. Moreover, by Theorem [\ref=depthincrease], we have [formula]. An application of Lemma [\ref=key] finishes the proof.

Depth and group cohomology

Let G be a compact Lie group with classifying space BG. And let p be a fixed prime. In this section, cohomology is always taken with [formula]-coefficients and [formula].

As in the introduction we denote by Fp(G) the Quillen category of G and by FG:Fp(G)op  →   the functor mapping E to BCG(E). The natural transformation FG  →  1BG establishes a map [formula]. Jackowski and McClure showed that this map induces an isomorphism in mod-p cohomology. In fact they showed that [formula], that [formula] for i  ≥  1 [\cite=jm].

Passing to classifying spaces and mod-p cohomology induces a functor

[formula]

which turns out to be a an equivalence of categories [\cite=dwcendec]. Moreover, for a subgroup ie:E  ⊂  G, we have [formula] [\cite=lannes]. Hence, identifying both categories, there exists a natural equivalence [formula], where [formula] denotes the functor constructed in the previous section in the case M = A = H*(BG). In particular, this implies that Li(H*(BG)) = 0 for all i  ≥   - 1. and that [formula] (Theorem [\ref=depthincrease]).

The inclusion CG(E)  ⊂  G induces a K-map H*(BG)  →  H*(BCG(E)) and makes the target into a finitely generated H*(BG)-module [\cite=quillen]. Hence, [formula] [\cite=serre]).

Applying Corollary [\ref=litrivial] and fitting all the above arguments together, this proves the following statement.

Let G be a compact Lie group. Then,

[formula]

If [formula] then we have E  ⊂  CG(E') and CG(E) = CCG(E')(E). Hence, in the above theorem, we only have to take the minimum over all 1-dimensional elementary abelian p-subgroups.

Results of the Jackowski-McClure type do exist for homotopy theoretic versions of groups. In particular, Theorem [\ref=maingroupcohomology] also holds for p-compact groups and p-local finite groups. For definitions and concepts of these notions see [\cite=dwannals] and [\cite=dwcenter] respectively [\cite=blo1].

Depth and polynomial invariants

We use the same notation as in the introduction, V denotes a finite dimensional [formula]-vector space, [formula] is a (faithful) representation, [formula] denotes the ring of polynomial functions on V respectively the symmetric algebra on the dual of V, [formula] the subalgebra of polynomial invariants, S the collection of all point wise stabilizer subgroups of non-trivial subspaces of V whose order is divisible by p, OS(G)  ⊂  O(G) the full subcategory of the orbit category associated to the collection S and [formula] the functor given by [formula]. For a linear subspace U  ⊂  V, we denote by GU the point wise stabilizer of U.

If p divides the order of G and [formula] is a faithful representation, then

[formula]

In particular, this says that [formula] for all non-trivial subspaces U  ⊂  V. Since, for U  ⊂  W  ⊂  V, we have GU = (GW)U, we get away in the above statement by taking the minimum over all 1-dimensional subspaces.

The proof is based on Lemma [\ref=key] and Theorem [\ref=depthincrease]. Before we can apply these results, we have to recall the necessary setting. We make [formula] into a graded [formula]-algebra by giving all polynomial generators the degree 2. Then, there exists a unique A-action on [formula] and [formula] becomes an object of K. Moreover, the A-action is inherited to the ring of polynomial invariants [formula]. If U  ⊂  V, the composition [formula] is a K map and [formula]. For example, all these constructions and claims can be found in [\cite=nesm]. In particular, this shows that [formula] for all non-trivial subspaces U  ⊂  V (Theorem [\ref=depthincrease]).

By [\cite=nodecrep] we have

[formula]

Since [formula] for all objects G / H∈OS(G), an application of Corollary [\ref=litrivial] finishes the proof.

Stanley-Reisner algebras

An abstract simplicial complex K with m-vertices given by the set [formula] consists of a finite set [formula] of subsets of V, which is closed with respect to formation of subsets. The subsets σi  ⊂  V are called the faces of K. The dimension of K is denoted by [formula] and [formula], if every face σ of K has order [formula] and there exists a maximal face μ of order [formula]. We consider the empty set [formula] as a face of K.

For a field [formula] we denote by [formula] the associated face ring or Stanley-Reisner algebra of K over [formula]. It is the quotient [formula], where [formula] is a polynomial algebra on m-generators and [formula]. We can think of [formula] as a graded object. It will be convenient to choose the topological grading and give the generators of [formula] and [formula] the degree 2.

Each abstract simplicial complex K has a geometric realization, denoted by |K|. Let Δ(V) denote the full simplicial complex whose faces are given by all subsets of V. One realization of Δ(V) is given by the standard m - 1-dimensional simplex [formula], where e1,...,em denotes the standard basis. And a topological realization of K is given by the subset |K|  ⊂  |Δ(V)| defined by the subset relation K  ⊂  Δ(V). We define the cohomology groups H*(K) of K as the cohomology groups H*(|K|) of the topological realization. And [formula] will denote the reduced cohomology.

For a face σ∈K, the star [formula] and the link [formula] of σ are defined as the simplicial subcomplexes [formula] and [formula].

Let K be an abstract finite simplicial complex. Let [formula]. Then the following conditions are equivalent: (i) [formula]. (ii) For all faces σ∈K we have [formula] for [formula]. (iii) [formula] for i  ≤  r - 2 and for all points x∈|K|.

The equivalence of the last two conditions was shown by Munkres [\cite=munkres]. In fact, for each face σ∈K and each inner point x∈σ, he showed that [formula]. This shows that the depth condition only depends on the topological structure of |K|, and not on the simplicial structure of K.

Since the Krull dimension of [formula] equals [formula], the face ring [formula] is Cohen-Macaulay if and only if [formula]. This shows that the above theorem generalizes Reisner's characterization of Cohen-Macaulay face rings [\cite=reisner].

The proof needs some preparation. The poset structure of K, given by the subset relation between the faces, gives rise to a category denoted by (K), and the non-empty faces of K to the full subcategory (K×)  ⊂  (K). There exists a functor [formula] taking values in the category of [formula]-algebras. For a face σ∈K we define [formula]. For an inclusion σ  ⊂  τ, we have [formula], which defines the map [formula].

The following theorem is proved in [\cite=notopint]:

Let K be an abstract finite simplicial complex. Then,

[formula]

Let K be an abstract finite simplicial complex. For all faces σ∈K we have [formula].

Since [formula], the first equation always holds. Here, [formula] denotes the polynomial subalgebra generated by all vi such that i∈σ.

For the proof of the second equation we first assume that [formula]. Then, [formula] is an unstable algebra over the Steenrod algebra. For σ  ⊂  V we denote by Eσ the [formula]-fold product of the cyclic group [formula] of order p. Then, [formula] is a subalgebra in the category K. In fact, it is the polynomial part of Hσ. Let φσ denote the composition [formula]. By [\cite=nora2], there exists an isomorphism [formula]. Now, the second equation follows from Theorem [\ref=depthincrease].

If [formula] is a general field of characteristique p > 0, the claim follows from the observation that [formula].

If [formula], then we notice that [formula] is the maximum of the set [formula]. And if [formula] is a general field of characteristique 0, then we can argue as in the case of positive characteristique.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=mainsr]: By Theorem [\ref=srdec], the groups [formula] are all finite and vanish for i =  - 1, and i  ≥   dim K + 1. We can apply Lemma [\ref=key].

If [formula], then [formula] for all σ∈K (Proposition [\ref=depthstarinherited]), and [formula] for i  ≤  r - 2. (Lemma [\ref=key]).

If [formula] for all [formula] and if [formula] for i  ≤  r - 2, Lemma [\ref=key] shows that [formula].

Since [formula] and since [formula], an induction over the dimension of the simplicial complexes proves the claim.
