A theorem of Poincaré-Hopf type

AMS classification: 55N33 57R25 Keywords: intersection homology Poincaré-Hopf vector field radial

Introduction

M.-H. Schwartz has defined radial vector fields in [\cite=Sc1] and extended the classical Poincaré-Hopf theorem to real analytic sets, equipped with a Whitney stratification for these vector fields [\cite=Sc4], [\cite=Sc5]. In their turn, H. King and D. Trotman have extended M.-H. Schwartz's result to more general singular spaces and generic vector fields [\cite=KT].

Radial [\cite=Sc1], [\cite=Sc3] (and totally radial, see [\cite=KT], [\cite=Si2]) vector fields are important because of their relation with Chern-Schwartz-Mac Pherson classes. Chern-Mac Pherson classes are written as an integral combination of Mather classes of algebraic varieties with coefficients determined by local Euler obstructions [\cite=Mac1]. A transcendental definition (and the original one) of local Euler obstruction is the obstruction to extend a lift of a radial vector field, prescribed on the link of a point in the base, inside a whole neighborood of Nash transform. Chern-Schwartz classes [\cite=Sc1], [\cite=Sc3] (which lie in cohomology of the complex analytic variety) are defined as the obstruction to extend a radial frame field given on a sub-skeleton of a fixed triangulation. These two points of view coincide: Chern-Mac Pherson classes are identified with Chern-Schwartz classes by Alexander duality [\cite=BS]. In [\cite=BBFGK], it is shown that these Chern-MacPherson-Schwartz classes can be realised (in general not uniquely) in intersection homology with middle perversity.

This paper concerns a Poincaré-Hopf theorem in intersection homology for a stratified pseudo-manifold A ([\cite=GM1]) and a vector field v which does not necessarily admit a globally continuous flow. Our main result is that we still have a Poincaré-Hopf formula when the vector field is semi-radial [\cite=KT] :

[formula]

More precisely, we compute (algebraically) the Euler characteristic of a complex of sheaves with constructible cohomology. A stratified Poincaré-Hopf formula is then a consequence of the smooth Poincaré-Hopf theorem and of additivity of the Euler-Poincaré characteristic with compact supports, once we have a suitable definition of index. Given a vector field with isolated singularities on a singular space, which admits a globally continuous flow, one can already deduce a Poincaré-Hopf theorem from a Lefschetz formula in intersection homology with middle perversity [\cite=GM2], [\cite=GM3], [\cite=Mac2].

A. Dubson announced in [\cite=Du] a formula similar to ours for a constructible complex in a complex analytic framework. In [\cite=BDK], J.-L. Brylinski, A. Dubson and M. Kashiwara expressed the "local characteristic" of a holonomic module as a function of multiplicities of polar varieties and local Euler obstructions.

M. Goresky and R. MacPherson have proved a Lefschetz fixed point theorem for a subanalytic morphism and constructible complex of sheaves [\cite=GM3]. They show that a weakly hyperbolic morphism (i.e. whose fixed points are weakly hyperbolic) can be lifted to a morphism (not necessarily unique) at the level of sheaves. The Lefschetz number can be written as a sum of contributions of the various connected components of fixed points, a component being itself possibly stratified; every contribution is a sum of multiplicities (relative to the morphism), weighted by Euler characteristics in compactly supported cohomology of the strata of the connected component.

In Section 2 we give a formula to calculate the characteristic of a constructible complex of sheaves. Then, in section 3, we apply the preceding results to the intersection chain complex. A brief recall of definitions and results on stratified vector fields is given in section 4. A theorem of Poincaré-Hopf type appears in section 5, where the vector field considered is totally (or only semi-) radial. Sections 6 and 7 are devoted to illustrate the theorems of section 4.

I am very grateful to D. Trotman for numerous valuable conversations, and for his constant encouragement. I thank equally J.-P. Brasselet for the discussions we have had related to this work. I am also greatly indebted to E. Leichtnam for his active interest and for many helpful suggestions during the preparation of the paper.

A formula to calculate the Euler-Poincaré characteristic of a complex of sheaves with constructible cohomology

First we recall some definitions. Let R be a principal ideal domain. We shall consider sheaves of R - modules.

Recall that [formula] where [formula] denotes hypercohomology with compact supports. As usual, suppose that Hpc(A;F) has finite rank for p  ≥  0 and is null for large enough p. Then we call Euler characteristic of A with compact supports and coefficients in F, the alternating sum of the ranks of the modules Hpc(A;F) and denote it by χc(A;F). When the sheaf F is the constant sheaf R, we simply write χc(A). We shall see that the Euler characteristic is always defined in our situation.

Let X be a locally compact topological space, G a locally constant sheaf on X of finite rank g and suppose that X admits a finite partition T into open simplexes, i.e. there exists a finite simplicial complex (resp. subcomplex, possibly empty) K (resp. L) and a homeomorphism [formula]. Then

[formula]

Proof. As simplexes of X are contractible, the restriction of G is isomorphic to the constant sheaf over any one of them. Consider the finite union U of open simplexes of maximal dimension m. By induction on m and using the long cohomological exact sequence (with compact supports) of (U,X), we are reduced to showing the result for U. But, applying Mayer-Vietoris to the partition of U, this shows that χc(U;G|U) is well defined and establishes the formula.

Let A be a compactifiable stratified set and (B,B) a compactification of A. Let [formula] be the strata of A and F an A  -  constructible sheaf. Then we have :

[formula]

Proof. Write [formula] for the closure of A in B. Thanks to the triangulation theorem for abstract stratified sets of M. Goresky [\cite=Gor], there exists a triangulation T of [formula] adapted to the stratification [formula]. As [formula] is compact, this triangulation is finite. Moreover, it is also adapted to A.

We are going to do induction on the number of strata of A and apply the method of proof of proposition 2.1. Let X be a stratum of maximal depth ([\cite=V2]) in A. Remark that X is closed in A. If A = X we apply proposition 2.1 with X and F.

Suppose the cardinal of A is strictly greater than 1.

We have then a long exact sequence in cohomology :

[formula]

As the number of strata of [formula] is strictly smaller than that in A, we can apply the induction hypothesis to [formula] and [formula]. This shows that rk Hpc(A;F) is finite, so χc(A;F) is defined. On the other hand, we have :

[formula]

We conclude by using the induction hypothesis and proposition 2.1. Let [formula] be a complex of sheaves. Let [formula] be the complex of derived sheaves. Proof. As Fp is c - acyclic for all [formula], we have [formula] for all [formula] and q  ≥  1. So the second spectral sequence, of second term [formula], degenerates. As [formula] is bounded, the filtration of the associated double complex is regular, so the first spectral sequence is convergent and we have according to theorem 4.6.1 of [\cite=God] p. 178 :

[formula]

As [formula] has A  -  constructible cohomology and A is compactifiable, we can define :

[formula]

for [formula] is bounded. Remark that, since A is triangulable, every point of A (which is paracompact) admits a neighborhood homeomorphic to a subspace of some [formula], so that A is of cohomological dimension lower or equal to p (<    ∞   because A is compactifiable), according to theorem 5.13.1 of [\cite=God] p. 237. Apply then proposition 2.2 to A and [formula] :

[formula]

with xi∈Xi for [formula]. As Er + 1 = H(Er), we have χ(Er + 1) = χ(Er) for all r  ≥  2. So χ(Er) = χ(E2) for all r  ≥  2.

As [formula] is bounded, Ep,q2 = 0 for q big enough or small enough and [formula]. Thus the spectral sequence degenerates and so

[formula]

for r big enough.

Hence

[formula]

But (Ep,q∞)p + q = s is the associated graded module to [formula]. We have thus :

[formula]

Finally

[formula]

Remark. Theorem 2.1 works also with the weaker hypothesis of (finite) triangulabity.

Application to intersection homology

Suppose now that A is a pseudo-manifold, and let A be its stratification. Here the strata of A will no longer be necessarily connected, but we shall work with connected components of strata. We denote by Lx the link of the point x in A.

Let A be an n-pseudo-manifold and [formula] a perversity. Let [formula] be the intersection chain complex for perversity [formula] with coefficients in R [\cite=GM3] and set [formula]sheaf associated to the presheaf [formula]. Then [formula] is a complex of c - soft sheaves (so c - acyclic). Moreover we have :

[formula]

Let A be an n-pseudo-manifold, x any point in a stratum Xk of A of dimension k and Lx the link of Xk at x in A. The fibre of the complex of derived sheaves [formula] is given by :

[formula]

As usual the Euler-Poincaré characteristic in intersection homology [formula] of an n-pseudo-manifold A is the Euler-Poincaré characteristic with compact supports of the complex of sheaves [formula] multiplied by ( - 1)n, i.e. [formula] Proof. Application of theorem 2.1 and proposition 3.2. Remark. As in theorem 2.1 we can weaken the hypothesis by only assuming the existence of a (finite) triangulation compatible with the stratification.

Let A be a 2n-pseudo-manifold such that (A,A) is compactifiable, the dimension of strata being even and let [formula] be the middle perversity. We have :

[formula]

where we have written X2ik (resp. Ni) for the k-th connected component of the stratum (resp. number of connected components of the stratum) of dimension 2i, xki an arbitrary point of X2ik and [formula].

Proof. We apply theorem 2.1 with [formula] and we remark that χc(X) = χc(X) for a manifold X of even dimension.

Totally radial and semi-radial vector fields on abstract stratified sets

M.-H. Schwartz constructed certain frame fields to define (by obstruction) her Chern-Schwartz classes in the cohomology of a singular complex analytic variety equipped with a Whitney stratification [\cite=Sc1], [\cite=Sc3]. These were called radial fields. When one is concerned with 1-frame fields (i.e. vector fields), they are called radial vector fields. She showed that they verified a Poincaré-Hopf formula [\cite=Sc4], [\cite=Sc5].

This section is an easy transcription to abstract stratified sets of some notions and results of [\cite=KT] which were given in the more general setting of "mapping cylinder stratified space with boundary". In their paper, H. King and D. Trotman extend M.-H. Schwartz's work on Poincaré-Hopf formulas, to more general spaces, and to generic vector fields. Notice that abstract stratified sets are not (necessarily) embedded nor are vector fields (necessarily) continuous. In [\cite=KT] such a vector field was called radial. To avoid confusion with the radial vector fields of M.-H. Schwartz, we have adopted the terminology totally radial, which also expresses the fact that one imposes that dρX(v) > 0 on a whole neighborhood UX of X in TX. The analoguous condition is only imposed on a neighbourhood of some closed subset of X by M.H. Schwartz. See [\cite=Si2] for a detailed discussion of the differences between the radial fields of [\cite=Sc4], [\cite=Sc5] and the radial fields of [\cite=KT], called totally radial here.

Let (A,A) be an abstract stratified set and Y a stratum of A. Then there exists a vector field ξY on [formula] such that :

[formula]

Proof. It suffices to consider the stratified submersion [formula] and to lift the constant field (0,∂t) to a field ξY on [formula]. Thanks to the compatibility conditions, we see that ρX*(ξY) = 0 for X < Y. Examples. Totally radial vector fields, and controlled vector fields, are semi-radial.

Let (A,A) be an abstract stratified set (resp. compactifiable stratified set) and v a semi-radial (resp. strongly semi-radial) vector field with isolated singularities on A. Then there exists a (resp. strongly) totally radial vector field v' having the same singularities as v and the same indices at these points.

Towards a Poincaré-Hopf theorem

Remark. The multiplicity is nothing else than [formula] (which equals ( - 1)n if x∈Areg). Proof. As in [\cite=Be], for all strata X of A, let fX be a carpeting function, i.e. let Ub(X) be a neighborhood of [formula] in [formula], and let [formula] be a continuous function (constructed using the control functions {ρX}X  ⊆  A induced by the compactification of A), smooth on the stratum X such that f- 1X(0) = b(X) and [formula] is submersive. Now, apply lemma 4.1 to v; this gives a totally radial vector field v'. Then we remark that if v' is a totally radial vector field, for all strata X, v' is entering [formula] along ∂Xε for ε small enough, where the symbol ∂Xε denotes the level hypersurface {fX  =  ε}. This is because [formula], where the aY are non-negative smooth functions, at every point of X. So we have [formula] thanks to the classical Poincaré-Hopf theorem. Finally, we have χc(M) = χc(M) - χc(∂M) for every compactifiable manifold M by adding a boundary ∂M. Use the "additivity" formula of theorem 3.1 and the definition of the singular index to complete the proof.

A few examples

In the following computations, as we are only interested in the rank of intersection homology groups, we shall take [formula] and work with the dimension of [formula]vector spaces. Moreover, this will permit us to apply Poincaré duality to calculate some associated groups. In the remainder of the text, T2 will denote the torus S1  ×  S1. The stratifications of spaces will be the evident ones and we shall not go into details. See [\cite=Bo] for classical tools to compute [formula] of the following spaces.

An inevitable example : the pinched torus T2p

We have a unique perversity [formula] and we have evidently a totally radial vector field u on T2p with a unique singularity at the isolated singular point x0 of T2p, of indice 1. The link at this point is [formula]. We have :

[formula]

so that

[formula]

On the other hand :

[formula]

Finally we have [formula]

A well-known example : the suspension of the torus ΣT2 (H. Poincaré, 1895)

This time, we have two different perversities [formula] and [formula] and two isolated singularities (which are the two vertices of suspension). The link at these points is Lx0 = Lx1 = T2. We still have a totally radial vector field v with two singular points of indice 1 at singularities of ΣT2. Remark that this pseudo-manifold is normal so we have [formula], i.e.

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

and by duality we find

[formula]

On the other hand :

[formula]

and

[formula]

Finally we have :

[formula]

and

[formula]

A hybrid example : the suspension of the torus of dimension 3, twice pinched, ΣT32p

We have [formula]. Here we have four perversities [formula]. Calculate to begin with the homology of T32p :

[formula]

Then its intersection homology is :

[formula]

where we deduce

[formula]

And at last the intersection homology of the suspension ΣT32p is :

[formula]

It is easy to construct a totally radial vector field w with four singularities : two at the vertices of suspension, say x0,x1, of indice 1 and two others on strata of codimension 3, say x2,x3, of indice - 1. Links are Lx0 = Lx1 = T32p and [formula]. Calculations of multiplicities give :

[formula]

and

[formula]

Finally we have

[formula]

A partial converse

We present here a partial converse to theorem 5.1 in the sense that we study when a stratified set admits a strongly totally radial vector field without singularity. This result is in the line of [\cite=Su], [\cite=V1] or [\cite=Sc5], [\cite=Sc6]. See also [\cite=Mat2], theorem 8.5. The result is partial because of the example below. Indeed, it shows that we cannot expect the condition [formula] to imply the existence of a non singular totally radial vector field. Proof. To show sufficiency, we use the carpeting functions of the proof of theorem 5.1. Let v be a strongly totally radial vector field on A with isolated singularities ; the vector field vX is entering on the boundary ∂X≥  ε (defined by a level hypersurface of a carpeting function). Remark that, as χc(X) = 0, we can deform vX on X≥  ε (without modifying it near ∂X≥  ε) so as to have no singularities ([\cite=H]). We have evidently ρX*(v) > 0 on [formula] for all strata X. Necessity is proved in an analogous manner.

Let A be a compactifiable n-pseudo-manifold, stratified with strata of odd dimension. Then there exists a strongly totally radial vector field without singularity on A.

Remark. Existence of a totally radial vector field without singularity, on an abstract stratified set, is equivalent to the existence of a controlled vector field without singularity.

Example. Finally, here is an example of a compact pseudo-manifold without strata of dimension 0 for which [formula] for every perversity [formula] and admitting no totally radial vector field without a singularity. Consider A = Σ(T32p)  ×  S2 ; it is clear that [formula] for all [formula]. Nevertheless, there does not exist a totally radial vector field without a singularity (look at strata {  *  }  ×  S2 or { *  * }  ×  S2). This is also evident as a consequence of theorem 7.1.
