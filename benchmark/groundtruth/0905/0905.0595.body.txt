Are all cofibrantly generated model categories combinatorial?

Combinatorial model categories were introduced by J. H. Smith as model categories which are locally presentable and cofibrantly generated. There are of course cofibrantly generated model categories which are not combinatorial - the first example is the standard model category of topological spaces. This model category is Quillen equivalent to the combinatorial model category of simplicial sets. G. Raptis [\cite=R] has recently proved a somewhat surprising result saying that, assuming Vop enka's principle, every cofibrantly generated model category is Quillen equivalent to a combinatorial model category. Vop enka's principle is a set-theoretical axiom implying the existence of very large cardinals (see [\cite=AR]). A natural question is whether Vop enka's principle (or other set theory) is needed for Raptis' result.

A model category is a complete and cocomplete category M together with three classes of morphisms F, C and W called fibrations, cofibrations and weak equivalences such that

W has the 2-out-of-3 property and is closed under retracts in the arrow category M→, and

[formula] and [formula] are weak factorization systems.

Morphisms from [formula] are called trivial fibrations while morphisms from [formula] trivial cofibrations.

A weak factorization system (L,R) in a category M consists of two classes L and R of morphisms of M such that

[formula], [formula], and

any morphism h of M has a factorization h = gf with f∈L and g∈R.

Here, [formula] consists of morphisms having the right lifting property w.r.t. each morphism from L and [formula] consists of morphisms having the left lifting property w.r.t. each morphism from R.

The standard definition of a cofibrantly generated model category (see [\cite=Ho]) is that the both weak factorization systems from its definition are cofibrantly generated in the following sense. A weak factorization system (L,R) is cofibrantly generated if there exists a set X of morphisms such that

the domains of X are small relative to X-cellular morphisms, and

[formula].

Here, X-cellular morphisms are transfinite compositions of pushouts of morphisms of X. The consequence of this definition is that L is the smallest cofibrantly closed class containing X. A cofibrantly closed class is defined as a class of morphisms closed under transfinite compositions, pushouts and retracts in M→. Moreover, one does not need to assume that (L,R) is a weak factorization system because it follows from (1) and (2). This observation led to the following more general definition of a cofibrantly generated weak factorization system (see [\cite=AHRT]).

A weak factorization system (L,R) is cofibrantly generated if there exists a set X of morphisms such that L is the smallest cofibrantly closed class containing X. The consequence is that [formula]. A model category is cofibrantly generated if the both weak factorization systems from its definition are cofibrantly generated in the new sense. It does not affect the definition of a combinatorial model category because all objects are small in a locally presentable category. Moreover, the proof of Raptis [\cite=R] works for cofibrantly generated model categories in this sense as well.

We will show that Vop enka's principle follows from the fact that every cofibrantly generated model category (in the new sense) is Quillen equivalent to a combinatorial model category. We do not know whether this is true for standardly defined cofibrantly generated model categories as well. Our proof uses the trivial model structure on a category M where all morphisms are cofibrations and weak equivalences are isomorphisms.

Given a small full subcategory A of a category K, the canonical functor

[formula]

assigns to each object K the restriction

[formula]

of its hom-functor [formula] to [formula] (see [\cite=AR] 1.25).

A small full subcategory A of a category K is called dense provided that every object of K is a canonical colimit of objects from A. It is equivalent to the fact that the canonical functor

[formula]

is a full embedding (see [\cite=AR], 1.26). A category K is called bounded if it has a (small) dense subcategory (see [\cite=AR]).

Dense subcategories were introduced by J. R. Isbell [\cite=I] and called left adequate subcategories. The following result is easy to prove and can be found in [\cite=I].

Let A be dense subcategory of K and B a small full subcategory of K containing A. Then B is dense.

Clearly, [formula] is a weak factorization system. The canonical functor

[formula]

has a left adjoint F (see [\cite=AR], 1.27). The weak factorization system [formula] in [formula] is cofibrantly generated (see [\cite=Ro1], 4.6). Thus there is a small full subcategory X of [formula] such that each morphism in [formula] is a retract of a X-cellular morphism. Hence each morphism in K is a retract of a F(X)-cellular morphism. Thus [formula] is cofibrantly generated.

Given a complete and cocomplete category K, the choice C  =  K and [formula] yields a model category structure on K. The corresponding two weak factorization systems are [formula] and [formula] and the homotopy category [formula]. We will call this model category structure trivial.

Following [\ref=prop0.2], it suffices to add that the weak factorization system [formula] is cofibrantly generated by [formula] where O is an initial object of K.

Necessity follows from [\cite=R]. Under the negation of Vop enka's principle, [\cite=AR], 6.12 presents a complete bounded category A with the following properties

For each regular cardinal λ, there is a λ-filtered diagram Dλ:Dλ  →  K whose only compatible cocones δλ are trivial ones with the codomain 1 (= a terminal object),

For each λ, [formula] does not factorize through any component of δλ.

Since, following (1), δλ is a colimit cocone for each λ, (2) implies that 1 is not λ-presentable for any regular λ. Condition (2) is not stated explicitly in [\cite=AR] but it follows from the fact that there is no morphism from 1 to a non-terminal object of A. In fact, A is the full subcategory of the category [formula] consisting of graphs A without any morphism Bi  →  A where Bi is the rigid class of graphs indexed by ordinals (whose existence is guaranteed by the negation of Vop enka's principle). The existence of a morphism 1  →  A means the presence of a loop in A and, consequently, the existence of a constant morphism Bi  →  A (having a loop as its value).

Assume that the trivial model category A is Quillen equivalent to a combinatorial model category M. Since [formula] is equivalent to A, it shares properties (1) and (2). Moreover, since [formula], the diagrams Dλ are diagrams in K. It follows from the definition of Quillen equivalence that the corresponding diagrams in [formula] (we will denote them by Dλ as well) can be rectified. It means that there are diagrams [formula] in M such that [formula]; here, [formula] is the canonical functor. Following [\cite=D] and [\cite=Ro], there is a regular cardinal λ0 such that the replacement functor R:M  →  M preserves λ0-filtered colimits. R sends each object M to a fibrant and cofibrant object and the canonical functor P can be taken as the composition QR where Q is the quotient functor identifying homotopy equivalent morphisms.

Let

[formula]

be colimit cocones. Then

[formula]

are colimit cocones for each λ  >  λ0. Following (1), [formula] for each λ  >  λ0. The object RMλ0 is μ-presentable in M for some regular cardinal λ0  <  μ. Since RMλ0 and RMμ are homotopy equivalent, there is a morphism f:RMλ0  →  RMμ. Since f factorizes through some [formula], [formula] factorizes through some component of δμ, which contradicts (2).

While the weak factorization system [formula] is cofibrantly generated in the sense of [\cite=Ho], it is not true for [formula] because the complete, cocomplete and bounded category in [\cite=AR], 6.12 is not locally presentable just because it contains a non-presentable object. Thus we do not know whether Vop enka's principle follows from the original result from [\cite=R].

The proof above does not exclude that A has a combinatorial model, i.e., that there is a combinatorial model category M such that A is equivalent to [formula].

If K is locally presentable the trivial model category K is combinatorial. Assume that the trivial model category K is equivalent to [formula] where M is a combinatorial model category. Let X be a dense subcategory of K. Following [\cite=Ro], 4.1, there is a regular cardinal λ such that

X  ⊆  P(Mλ) where Mλ denotes the full subcategory of M consisting of λ-presentable objects,

The composition H = EP(Mλ)  ·  P preserves λ-filtered colimits.

Since P(Mλ) is dense in K (see [\ref=le0.1]), EP(Mλ) is a full embedding. Hence K is the full image of the functor H, i.e., the full subcategory on objects H(M) with M in M. Following [\cite=Ro2], Corollary of Theorem 2, K is locally presentable.

Vop enka's principle is stronger than the existence of a proper class of compact cardinals. Thus, assuming the negation of Vop enka's principle but the existence of a proper class of compact cardinals, there is a cofibrantly generated model category without a combinatorial model.
