Generalizations of Bohr's inequality in Hilbert C*-modules

Introduction

The classical Bohr's inequality states that for any [formula] and any positive real numbers r,s with [formula],

[formula]

Many interesting generalizations of this inequality have been obtained in various settings; cf. [\cite=C-P] [\cite=HIR] [\cite=M-P-F] [\cite=M-P-P] [\cite=P-S] [\cite=P-D] [\cite=P-R] [\cite=RAS1] [\cite=V-K1] [\cite=ZHA]. O. Hirzallah [\cite=HIR] showed that if A,B belong to the algebra [formula] of all bounded linear operators on a complex Hilbert space [formula] and q  ≥  p > 1 with 1 / p  +  1 / q  =  1, then

[formula]

where |C|: = (C*C)1 / 2 denotes the absolute value of [formula]. W.-S. Cheung and J.E. Peari [\cite=C-P] extended the above inequality for all positive conjugate exponents [formula]. In addition, F. Zhang [\cite=ZHA], among others, generalized the above work of O. Hirzallah and presented an identity [\cite=ZHA] by removing the condition q  ≥  p.

In this paper we present a new operator equality in the framework of Hilbert C*-modules. As a consequence, we get a generalization of the Euler-Lagrange type identity in the setting of Hilbert bundles over locally compact spaces and extend the operator inequalities of [\cite=C-P], [\cite=HIR] and [\cite=ZHA] to get more generalized inequalities of the Bohr inequality type.

Preliminaries

The notion of Hilbert C*-module is a generalization of the notion of Hilbert space. This object was first used by I. Kaplansky [\cite=KAP]. Hilbert C*-modules are useful tools in Kasparov's formulation of KK-theory, theory of operator algebras, group representation theory, noncommutative geometry and theory of operator spaces. It provides a framework for extending the notion of Morita equivalence to C*-algebras and that of vector bundle to noncommutative C*-algebras. The theory of Hilbert C*-modules is interesting on its own right.

Let [formula] be a C*-algebra and [formula] be a complex linear space, which is a right [formula]-module satisfying λ(xa) = x(λa) = (λx)a for [formula]. The space [formula] is called a (right) pre-Hilbert C*-module over [formula] (or a (right) pre-Hilbert [formula]-module) if there exists an [formula]-inner product [formula] satisfying

(i) 〈x,x〉  ≥  0 and 〈x,x〉 = 0    if and only if    x = 0;

(ii) 〈x,y + λz〉  =  〈x,y〉  +  λ〈x,z〉;

(iii) 〈x,ya〉  =  〈x,y〉a;

(iv) 〈x,y〉*  =  〈y,x〉;

for all [formula].

We can define a norm on [formula] by [formula]. A pre-Hilbert [formula]-module is called a (right) Hilbert C*-module over [formula] (or a (right) Hilbert [formula]-module) if it is complete with respect to its norm. The notion of left Hilbert [formula]-module can be defined in a similar way.

Three typical examples of Hilbert C*-modules are as follows.

(I) Every Hilbert space is a left Hilbert [formula]-module.

(II) Let [formula] be a C*-algebra. Then [formula] is a Hilbert [formula]-module via [formula].

(III) Let

[formula]

Then [formula] is a Hilbert [formula]-module under the natural operations λ(ai) + (bi) = (λai + bi), (ai)a = (aia) and [formula].

A mapping [formula] between Hilbert [formula]-modules is called adjointable if there exists a mapping [formula] such that 〈T(x),y〉  =  〈x,S(y)〉 for all [formula]. The unique mapping S is denoted by T* and is called the adjoint of T. It is easy to see that T and T* must be bounded linear [formula]-module mappings. We denote by [formula] the space of all adjointable mappings from [formula] to [formula] We stand [formula] for the unital C*-algebra [formula]; cf. [\cite=LAN].

For every [formula] we define the absolute value of x as the unique positive square root of 〈x,x〉, that is, [formula]. We refer the reader to [\cite=MUR] for undefined notions on C*-algebra theory and to [\cite=LAN] [\cite=M-T] [\cite=R-W] for more information on Hilbert C*-modules.

Throughout the paper, we assume that [formula] and [formula] are Hilbert C*-modules over a unital C*-algebra [formula] with unit e. The identity operator on a set E is denoted by IE. By [formula] we denote the center of a C*-algebra [formula]

Main results

Let [formula] and let [formula] be such that [formula] is self-adjoint and [formula]. Then

[formula]

for all [formula].

Since

[formula]

and

[formula]

we get

[formula]

The following useful result is deduced from Theorem [\ref=prvi]. It can be proved directly as well.

Let [formula] and let [formula] be such that 〈x,y〉 is self-adjoint and α〈x,x〉  +  β〈y,y〉  =  γe. Then

[formula]

for all [formula].

For each [formula] consider two mappings [formula] and [formula] defined by Tz(a) = za and ẑ(v) = 〈z,v〉. The adjoint of Tz is ẑ, since

[formula]

for all [formula] and [formula] Furthermore, T*xTy is self-adjoint since

[formula]

for all [formula] In addition,

[formula]

for all [formula] Applying Theorem [\ref=prvi] with T = Tx and S = Ty, we obtain

[formula]

which proves the theorem.

Applying Theorem [\ref=cprvi] for elements of the Hilbert C*-module [formula] we get the following result.

Let [formula] and let [formula] be such that [formula] is self-adjoint and [formula] Then

[formula]

for all [formula].

Recall that the space [formula] of all bounded linear operators between Hilbert spaces [formula] and [formula] can be regarded as a Hilbert C*-module over the C*-algebra [formula] via 〈T,S〉 = T*S. Then the direct sum

[formula]

is a Hilbert [formula]-module, where the inner product is defined as [formula] [formula]. For such a Hilbert C*-module [formula], Theorem [\ref=cprvi] can be stated as follows.

Let [formula] and let [formula] be such that [formula] is self-adjoint and [formula]. Then

[formula]

for all [formula].

As another consequence of Theorem [\ref=prvi] we have the following generalization of the Euler-Lagrange type identity [\cite=T-R-S-T] in the framework of Hilbert C*-modules.

Let [formula] and let [formula] be such that a*b is self-adjoint and αa*a + βb*b = γe. Then

[formula]

for all [formula].

For each [formula], the mapping [formula] defined by Tc(x) = xc has the adjoint Tc*, since

[formula]

Furthermore,

[formula]

and

[formula]

The result follows by applying Theorem [\ref=prvi] with T = Ta and S = Tb.

Next consider a locally compact space K and assume that [formula] is a bundle of Hilbert spaces over K which satisfies appropriate continuous properties. Then the set C0(K,B) of all continuous mappings φ:K  →  B which vanishes at infinity and fulfills [formula] is a Hilbert C0(K)-module via

[formula]

where 〈  ·  |  ·  〉t stands for the inner product of Hilbert space [formula] (we denote the induced norm in [formula] by [formula]); see [\cite=KAP]. It is easy to see that |φ| is the function [formula]. The following result immediately follows from Theorem [\ref=eul-lagr]. The special case, where K is singleton, gives rise to the classical Euler-Lagrange type identity.

Suppose that [formula] is a bundle of Hilbert spaces over a locally compact space K. Let [formula] and let f,g∈C0(K) be real functions such that αf(t)2  +  βg(t)2  =  γ    (t∈K). Then

[formula]

for all φ,ψ∈C0(K,B).

A generalization of Bohr's inequality in Hilbert C*-modules deduced from Theorem [\ref=eul-lagr] as well as some generalizations of main results of [\cite=C-P] and [\cite=HIR] can be presented in the following theorem.

Let p,q > 1 be conjugate components. Then

[formula]

for all x,y in a Hilbert C*-module [formula]. Moreover,

[formula]

Furthermore, in (i) and (ii) the equality holds on the left hand side of the equivalence if and only if p = q = 2 or (1 - p)x = y.

Apply Theorem [\ref=eul-lagr] with a = e, b =  - e, α = 1, β = p - 1 and γ = p.

To achieve (i), use [\eqref=xyp] and the fact that [formula] if and only if p  ≤  2. The rest can be proved in a similar way.

A similar assertion can be proved for the case where p < 1, see [\cite=C-P]. Theorem [\ref=3.7] generalizes Bohr's inequality in Hilbert C*-modules only when p and q are positive conjugate exponents and p  ≤  2. Interchanging x  ↔  y and p  ↔  q in [\eqref=xyp] we also have

[formula]

From this we have a generalization of Bohr's inequality in the case when p > 2 (that is, 1 < q < 2). Namely, statement (i) of Theorem [\ref=3.7] now reads as follows:

[formula]

One more consequence of Theorem [\ref=prvi] is the following result.

Let α,β be positive real numbers satisfying α  +  β = 1. Let [formula] be such that [formula] is self-adjoint and [formula]. Then

[formula]

for all [formula].

The result follows immediately from Theorem [\ref=prvi] by taking γ  =  α  +  β = 1.

Our next result is a generalization of Corollary [\ref=bohr2] in the case of an arbitrary number of finitely many elements of [formula].

Let n  ≥  2 be a positive integer, let [formula], let T*1T2 be self-adjoint, and let [formula] be positive real numbers such that [formula] and [formula]. For n  ≥  3, assume T1 or T2 is invertible in [formula], operators [formula] are self-adjoint, and Ti|Tj| = |Tj|Ti for all 1  ≤  i < j  ≤  n. Then

[formula]

for all [formula].

We prove the statement by induction on n. The base case is true by Corollary [\ref=bohr2].

Suppose now that the inequality [\eqref=zhang] holds for n - 1  ≥  2 elements and let us show that it holds for n elements [formula]. Assume that Tk is invertible for some k∈{1,2}. Then

[formula]

implies invertibility of [formula] in [formula]. Let us put

[formula]

where

[formula]

Clearly, [formula] Si are self-adjoint for [formula] Sk is invertible as the product of two invertible operators, and S*1S2 is self-adjoint since

[formula]

Observe that for each 1  ≤  i < j  ≤  n, Ti|Tj| = |Tj|Ti implies |Ti||Tj| = |Tj||Ti| from which we get

[formula]

for all 1  ≤  j  ≤  n - 1. It follows that

[formula]

whence Si|Sj| = |Sj|Si for all 1  ≤  i < j  ≤  n - 1. In addition,

[formula]

By the inductive assumption we conclude that

[formula]

Let us denote [formula] Then

[formula]

Also,

[formula]

Using ([\ref=y]), ([\ref=uv]), ([\ref=pom]) and the fact that Tn is self-adjoint, we obtain

[formula]

This proves the theorem.

In Theorems [\ref=prvi] and [\ref=bohrn] and Corollary [\ref=bohr2] we do not need the underlying C*-algebra to be unital.

Let n  ≥  2 be a positive integer, let [formula], let a*1a2 be self-adjoint, and let [formula] be positive real numbers such that [formula] and [formula]. For n  ≥  3, assume that a1 or a2 is invertible in [formula] and [formula] are self-adjoint. Then

[formula]

for all [formula].

Let [formula] be the mapping defined by Ti(x) = xai ([formula]). Then, as seen in the proof of Theorem [\ref=eul-lagr], T*i = Ta*i and so |Ti| = T|ai|. One can easily verify that the operators Ti satisfy the assumptions of Theorem [\ref=bohrn]. Thus inequality ([\ref=zhang]) turns into ([\ref=zhangmain]).

When [formula] is the C*-algebra [formula] regarded as a Hilbert C*-module over itself, and [formula], the above result reduces to Theorem 7 of Zhang [\cite=ZHA], which is an AM-QM operator inequality.

Let [formula]. Then, for any set of nonnegative numbers [formula] with [formula],

[formula]
