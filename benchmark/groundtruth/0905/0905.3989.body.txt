Introduction and Results

Dyson's Brownian motion model of GUE (Gaussian unitary ensemble) is a stochastic process of positions of m particles, [formula] described by the stochastic differential equation,

[formula]

where Bi,1  ≤  i  ≤  m are independent one dimensional Brownian motions[\cite=Dyson1962]. The process satisfies [formula] for all t > 0. We remark that the process X can be started from the origin, i.e., one can take Xi(0) = 0,1  ≤  i  ≤  m. See [\cite=OY2002].

One can introduce similar non-colliding system of m particles with a wall at the origin [\cite=grabiner] [\cite=KT2004] [\cite=TW2007]. The dynamics of the positions of the m particles [formula] satisfying [formula] for all t > 0 are described by the stochastic differential equation,

[formula]

This process is referred to as Dyson's Brownian motion of type C. It can be interpreted as a system of m Brownian particles conditioned to never collide with each other or the wall.

One can also consider the case where the wall above is replaced by a reflecting wall[\cite=KT2004]. The dynamics of the positions of the m particles [formula] satisfying [formula] for all t > 0, is described by the stochastic differential equation,

[formula]

where L(t) denotes the local time of X(D)1 at the origin. This process will be referred to as Dyson's Brownian motion of type D. Some authors consider a process defined by the s.d.e.s (1.3) without the local time term. In this case the first component of the process is not constrained to remain non-negative, and the process takes values in the Weyl chamber of type D, [formula]. The process we consider with a reflecting wall is obtained from this by replacing the first component with its absolute value, with the local time term appearing as a consequence of Tanaka's formula.

It is known the processes X(C,D) can be obtained using the Doob h-transform, see [\cite=grabiner]. Let (P0,(C,D)t;t  ≥  0) be the transition semigroup for m independent Brownian motions killed on exiting [formula], resp. the transition semigroup for m independent Brownian motions reflected at the origin killed on exiting [formula]. From the Karlin-McGregor formula, the corresponding densities can be written as

[formula]

resp.,

[formula]

where [formula]. Let

[formula]

For notational simplicity we suppress the index C,D for the semigroups and in h in the following. Then one can show that h(x) is invariant for the P0t semigroup and we may define a Markov semigroup by

[formula]

This is the semigroup of the Dyson non-colliding system of Brownian motions of type C and D. Similarly to the X process, the processes X(C) and X(D) can also be started from the origin (see [\cite=BBO2005] or use Lemma 4 in [\cite=KT2004] and apply the same arguments as in [\cite=OY2002]).

In GUE Dyson's Brownian motion of n particles, let us take the initial conditions to be Xi(0) = 0,1  ≤  i  ≤  n. The quantity we are interested in is the maximum of the position of the top particle for a finite duration of time, max 0  ≤  s  ≤  tXn(s). In the sequel we write sup  instead of max  to conform with common usage in the literature. Let m be the integer such that n = 2m when n is even and n = 2m - 1 when n is odd. Consider the non-colliding systems of X(C),X(D) of m particles starting from the origin, X(C,D)i(0) = 0,1  ≤  i  ≤  m.

Our main result of this note is

Let X and X(C),X(D) start from the origin. Then for each fixed t  ≥  0, one has

[formula]

To prove the theorem we introduce two more processes Zj and Yj. In the Z process, [formula], Z1 is a Brownian motion and Zj + 1 is reflected by Zj, 1  ≤  j  ≤  n - 1. Here the reflection means the Skorokhod construction to push Zj + 1 up from Zj. More precisely,

[formula]

where Bi,1  ≤  i  ≤  n are independent Brownian motions, each starting from 0. The process is the same as the process [formula] studied in section 4 of [\cite=Warren2007]. The representation ([\ref=ZinB]) was given earlier in [\cite=Baryshnikov2001]. In the Y process, [formula], the interactions among Yi's are the same as in the Z process, i.e., Yj + 1 is reflected by Yj, 1  ≤  j  ≤  n - 1, but Y1 is now a Brownian motion reflected at the origin (again by Skorokhod construction). Similarly to ([\ref=ZinB]),

[formula]

From the results in [\cite=OY2002] [\cite=BJ2002] [\cite=Warren2007], we know

[formula]

and hence

[formula]

In this note we show

The following equalities in law hold between processes:

[formula]

[formula].

The proof of this proposition is given in Section [\ref=XCD_Wr]. The idea behind it is that the processes (Yi)i  ≥  1 and (X(C,D)j)j  ≥  1 could be realized on a common probability space consisting of Brownian motions satisfying certain interlacing conditions with a boundary [\cite=Warren2007] [\cite=WW2008]. Such a system is expected to appear as a scaling limit of the discrete processes considered in [\cite=BK2009] [\cite=WW2008]. In this enlarged process, the processes Yn(t) and X(C,D)m(t) just represent two different ways of looking at the evolution of a specific particle and so the statement of Proposition 2 follows immediately. Justification of such an approach is however quite involved, and we prefer to give a simple independent proof. See also [\cite=BJ2002] for another representation of X(C,D)m in terms of independent Brownian motions.

Then to prove ([\ref=thm]) it is enough to show

For each fixed t we have

[formula]

This is shown in Section [\ref=WWr]. For n = 1 case, this is well known from the Skorokhod construction of reflected Brownian motion [\cite=RY1999]. The n > 1 case can also be understood graphically by reversing time direction and the order of particles. This relation could also be established as a limiting case of the last passage percolation. In fact the identities in our theorem was first anticipated from the consideration of a diffusion scaling limit of the totally asymmetric exclusion process with 2 speeds [\cite=BFS2009p].

Proof of proposition [\ref=WXDC]

In this section we prove the relation between X(C,D) and Y, ([\ref=YX]). The following Lemma is a generalization of the Rogers-Pitman criterion [\cite=RP1981] for a function of a Markov process to be Markovian.

Suppose that {X(t):t  ≥  0} is a Markov process with state space E, evolving according to a transition semigroup (Pt;t  ≥  0) and with initial distribution μ. Suppose that {Y(t):t  ≥  0} is a Markov process with state space F, evolving according to a transition semigroup (Qt;t  ≥  0) and with initial distribution ν. Suppose further that L is a Markov transition kernel from E to F, such that μL = ν and the intertwining PtL = LQt holds. Now let f:E  →  G and g:F  →  G be maps into a third state space G, and suppose that

L(x,  ·  ) is carried by {y∈F:g(y) = f(x)} for each x∈E.

Then we have

[formula],

in the sense of finite dimensional distributions.

We let (Y(t):t  ≥  0) be the process Y of n reflected Brownian motions with a wall introduced in the previous section. It is clear from the construction ([\ref=YinB]) that the process Y is a time homogeneous Markov process. We denote its transition semigroup by [formula]. It turns out that there is an explicit formula for the corresponding densities. Recall [formula]. Let us define [formula] for k  ≥  0 and [formula] for k  ≥  1.

The transition densities qt(y,y') from [formula] at t = 0 to [formula] at t of the Y process can be written as

[formula]

where ai,j is given by

[formula]

The same type of formula was first obtained for the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process by Schütz [\cite=Schuetz1997b]. The formula for the Z process was given as a Proposition 8 in [\cite=Warren2007], see also [\cite=Sa1998].

For n = 2m, resp. n = 2m - 1 we take (X(t),t  ≥  0) to be Dyson Brownian motion of type C, resp. of type D. The transition semigroup [formula] of this process is given by ([\ref=Pt]).

Let [formula] denote the set with n layers [formula] where [formula], [formula] and the intertwining relations,

[formula]

and

[formula]

hold (Fig. [\ref=sGZ]). Let n = 2m or n = 2m - 1 for some integer m. We define a kernel L0 from [formula] to [formula]. For [formula], define [formula] [formula] and [formula]. The kernel L0 is defined by

[formula]

where the integrals are taken with respect to Lebesgue measure but integrations with respect to z on the RHS is for b(z) = x fixed.

The function h defined at [\eqref=h] is equal to the Euclidean volume of [formula]. Consequently we may define L to be the Markov kernel L(x,dy) = L0(x,dy) / h(x). In the remaining part of this section we show

[formula]

Now if we apply Lemma [\ref=RP] with f(x) = xm, g(y) = yn and the initial conditions starting from the origin we obtain ([\ref=YX]).

Proof of proposition [\ref=maxWWr]

Using ([\ref=YinB]) repeatedly, one has

[formula]

with tn + 1 = t. By renaming t - tn - i + 1 by ti and changing the order of the summation, we have

[formula]

Since [formula],
