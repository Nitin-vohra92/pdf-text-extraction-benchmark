Van der Waals forces and spatial dispersion

Introduction. It was recently discovered that effects of the spatial dispersion are quite important for calculations of the Van der Waals forces[\cite=VdW] between conducting bodies at finite temperatures (see [\cite=Sernelius] [\cite=Esquivel] [\cite=Pitaevskii] [\cite=Lam] [\cite=Svetovoy]). On the other hand, an opinion has been expressed in several papers that the theory of the forces in the present form is not valid in the presence of this dispersion (see [\cite=Most1] [\cite=KMPRA07] [\cite=Most2]). The goal of this paper is to prove rigorously that the theory of the Van der Waals forces, as it was formulated in the terms of Green's functions in papers [\cite=DP] [\cite=DLP] (DLP below, see also [\cite=LP9]), can be used for calculation of the forces for bodies separated by vacuum, even if the spatial dispersion is important for electromagnetic properties of the bodies.

To my understanding, the doubts about the validity of the theory in the presence of the spatial dispersion is based on a remark in a paper by Barash and Ginzburg [\cite=BG75]. In this paper, the contribution to the free energy of the long-wave fluctuations of the electromagnetic field is presented in the form

[formula]

where Dn is the Matsubara Green's function of the system under considerations and [formula]  and [formula] are correspondingly the Green's function and the polarization operator of an auxiliary system in which interaction with the long-wave field is defined by the "charge" [formula] instead the actual charge e (see [\cite=BG75], Eq. (54)). The prime sign means that the n = 0 term is taken with the coefficient 1 / 2. The first term in ([\ref=BG]) corresponds to the DLP theory, while the second gives an additional contribution. The authors noticed that in the presence of significant spatial dispersion the second term cannot be neglected and consequently the free energy cannot be expressed only in terms of the Green's functions of the actual system.

However, in my opinion this statement is related to the general case, when bodies are embedded in a liquid with spatial dispersion. Results of the DLP theory are indeed difficult to generalize to this case due to the non-local nature of the stress tensor in a such liquid. In the important case when the interacting bodies are separated by vacuum this difficulty does not arise. Indeed, forces acting between any bodies separated by vacuum can be calculated by averaging of the vacuum Maxwell stress tensor. Corresponding quadratic combinations of the field strengths can in turn be expressed in terms of the retarded Green's function of the field using the exact fluctuation-dissipation theorem (see [\cite=LP9]). This Green's function, of course, must be calculated taking into account the spatial dispersion in the bodies, when it is important. This programme wil be realized below. It is convenient to use an approach which is different both from [\cite=DP] [\cite=DLP] and [\cite=BG75]. (The basic idea of the derivation was expressed in short in [\cite=Pitaevskii].)

Maxwell stress tensor. The force acting in vacuum on a body due to electromagnetic fluctuations is equal to[\cite=foot1]

[formula]

where the integration is performed over any surface enclosing only the given body and σik is the average value of the Maxwell stress tensor of electromagnetic fluctuations in vacuum:

[formula]

Here we introduced notations for the averages from operator expressions:

[formula]

and

[formula]

I consider only the equilibrium situation and averaging is taken using the Gibbs statistics. Thus the problem reduces to calculation of the average of quadratic combinations of field strength operators. Notice, that this method of calculation of forces can be applied only in vacuum, because there is in general no equation for the stress tensor of non-static fields in an arbitrary medium.

Fluctuation-dissipation theorem. To define these averages one can use the exact fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT). To apply this theorem one must consider correlation functions of the fields in different points in space and different moments of time:

[formula]

where we took into account the uniformity with respect to time. The magnetic function [formula] is defined in an analogous way. We need also the correlation function of the components of the 4-vector potential. Following [\cite=DP] we will use the gauge with the scalar potential φ = 0. Then

[formula]

and SEik , SBik  can be expressed as (we put c =  below)

[formula]

in the terms of the correlation function of the components of [formula]:

[formula]

Expand now the function SAik in the Fourier integral with respect to time:

[formula]

The central point of the proof is that the fluctuation-dissipation theorem allows us to express [formula] in the terms of the retarded Green's function of the electromagnetic field. Indeed, the interaction of the field with the current is given by the equation

[formula]

Let us consider the vector-potential which is induced by a classical external current with the density [formula] In the linear approximation the induced potential can be expressed in the terms of the retarded Green's function of the vector-potential:

[formula]

where, according the Kubo equation,

[formula]

Then according to the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (see [\cite=LL5], sections 122-125 and [\cite=LP9], sections 75-76),

[formula]

If the bodies are not magnetoactive, the D-function satisfies the Onsager symmetry relation [formula] Then we find finally

[formula]

This equation together with ([\ref=SEA]) solves the problem of calculating electromagnetic fluctuations in the terms of DR. One has

[formula]

and

[formula]

Equation ([\ref=Kubo]) is not very useful for calculating the function DRik. However, DR can be calculated directly using equation ([\ref=ext]). Indeed, let us place a unit point-like current directed in the l-direction at the point [formula] i. e. put

[formula]

Using a proper theory of electrodynamic properties of the interacting bodies, one must calculate the linear response [formula] for the source ([\ref=source]). Then according to ([\ref=ext]) we get

[formula]

It is important that it is enough for the calculation of the tensor to consider the source placed in vacuum between the bodies. This, for example, allows in a simple plain geometry to express DRik in the terms of the reflection amplitude on the surfaces of the bodies. Expression ([\ref=Dsource]) for DRik diverges at [formula] This divergency can be eliminated by subtracting the response [formula] for the source ([\ref=source]), calculated for free space.

Notice that according to ([\ref=EiEkD])-([\ref=BiBkD])  the stress tensor can be presented in the form

[formula]

where [formula] is an analytical function having no singularities in the upper half-plane ω. Displacing the contour of integration to the imaginary axes of ω, as in the original Lifshitz paper[\cite=Lif], and taking the residues in the poles of the coth , we reduce ([\ref=sigmaR]) to the Matsubara form:

[formula]

Conclusion. The general theory which I present here does not give, of course, a magic prescription for solution of all problems of Van der Waals forces in the presence of spatial dispersion. Calculations of the DR function as a response to a point source can be difficult and in any case demands a sort of microscopic theory. However, I believe that reducing the problem to the exact fluctuation-dissipation theorem gives a solid foundation for different theoretical approaches.

It must be noted however that in a recent paper [\cite=Most2] the authors express doubts about the validity of the Lifshitz theory based on this theorem for materials with finite d.c. conductivity. Because FDT is a rigorous theorem of quantum statistical mechanics, such doubts must have a very serious foundation. On the contrary, the consideration of the authors are, in my opinion, quite superficial. One can read in [\cite=Most2] (I omit references):

Lifshitz derived his famous formulae under the condition of thermal equilibrium. This means that not only T =  const, but also all irreversible processes connected with the dissipation of energy into heat have already been terminated ... The Drude-like dielectric function ... is derived from the Maxwell equations with a real drift current of conduction electrons [formula] initiated by the external electric field [formula] ... The drift current is an irreversible process which brings a system out of thermal equilibrium. ... The real current leads to Joule's heating of the Casimir plates (Ohmic losses) ... To preserve the temperature constant, one should admit that there exists an unidirectional flux of heat from the medium to the heat reservoir ... Such interactions between a system and a heat reservoir are prohibited by the definition of thermal equilibrium. Although the screening and diffusion effects really occur in an external electric field, they are also related to physical situations out of thermal equilibrium. The reason is that the diffusion current is determined by a nonzero gradient of charge carrier density, whereas for homogeneous systems in thermal equilibrium the charge carrier density must be homogeneous.

I believe that these considerations are wrong. Of course, one can say that the fluctuating electric field heats a body. However, in equilibrium this heating is compensated by emission of radiation by the body. This exact compensation is ensured by the detailed balance principle. The sentence about termination of dissipation of energy is particularly odd in relation to the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, which just connects the energy dissipation with fluctuations. It is not clear, by the way, why the authors worry only about the Ohmic losses. At finite frequencies all real materials dissipate energy.

The statement that the screening and diffusion effects are related to physical situations out of thermal equilibrium is also wrong. It is well-known that the Boltzmann distribution in the electric field, which was used in [\cite=Pitaevskii] for describing screening, is an equilibrium distribution. Actually, in equilibrium the diffusion current is compensated by the mobility of carriers due to an electric field.

The authors of [\cite=Most2] claim also that for dielectrics whose charge carrier density is temperature-independent (for such materials conductivity goes to zero with T not due to the vanishing n but due to the vanishing mobility of the charge carriers) the generalization of the Lifshitz theory taking into account the screening effects is shown to violate the Nernst theorem and is consequently in contradiction with thermodynamics . I believe that this statement is a result of a pure misunderstanding. The materials under discussion are amorphous glass-like disordered bodies. Conductivity goes to zero with T in such materials due to localization of the charge carriers just because of the disorder. The point is that the Nernst theorem is not valid for these disordered bodies. It is well known that they have a big finite entropy at zero temperature. Localized carriers also contribute to this residual entropy and the calculation of a small correction to its value due to the Van der Waals interaction scarcely has a physical meaning. Of course, the existence of disordered bodies at T = 0 itself does not contradict statistical mechanics. They are simply not at an equilibrium state at low temperatures due to a very long relaxation time. However, the role for our phenomena of the long relaxation time in these bodies is not clear at present and is worth of careful investigation.
