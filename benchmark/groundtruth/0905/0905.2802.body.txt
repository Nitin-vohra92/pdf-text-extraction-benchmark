Segal-Bargmann transform and Paley-Wiener theorems on M(2)

Introduction

Consider the following results from Euclidean Fourier analysis :

(I):A function [formula] admits a factorization f(x)  =  g * pt(x) where [formula] and [formula] (the heat kernel on [formula]) if and only if f extends as an entire function to [formula] and we have [formula] (z  =  x  +  iy). In this case we also have

[formula]

The mapping [formula] is called the Segal-Bargmann transform and the above says that the Segal-Bargmann transform is a unitary map from [formula] onto [formula] where [formula] and [formula] denotes the space of entire functions on [formula]

(II) A function [formula] admits a holomorphic extension to the strip {x  +  iy:|y|  <  t} such that

[formula]

if and only if

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the Fourier transform of f.

(III) An [formula] admits an entire extension to [formula] such that

[formula]

if and only if [formula] and supp [formula] where [formula] is the ball of radius R centered around 0 in [formula]

In this paper we aim to prove similar results for the non-commutative group [formula] Some remarks are in order.

As noted above the map [formula] in (I) is called the Segal-Bargmann transform. This transform has attracted a lot of attention in the recent years mainly due to the work of Hall [\cite=H] where a similar result was established for an arbitrary compact Lie group K. Let qt be the heat kernel on K and let [formula] be the complexification of K. Then Hall's result, Theorem 2 in [\cite=H], states that the map f  →  f  *  qt is a unitary map from L2(K) onto the Hilbert space of ν-square integrable holomorphic functions on [formula] for an appropriate positive K-invariant measure ν on [formula] Soon after Hall's paper a similar result was proved for compact symmetric spaces by Stenzel in [\cite=S]. We also refer to [\cite=HL], [\cite=HM], [\cite=KOS] and [\cite=KTX] for similar results for other groups and spaces.

The second result above (II) is originally due to Paley and Wiener. Let

[formula]

Then [formula] may be viewed as the space of all analytic vectors for the regular representation of [formula] on [formula] This point of view was further developed by R. Goodman (see [\cite=G1] and [\cite=G2]) who studied analytic vectors for representations of Lie groups. The theorem of Paley-Wiener (II) characterizes analytic vectors for the regular representation of [formula] via a condition on the Fourier transform.

The third result (III) is the classical Paley-Wiener theorem. For a long time the Paley-Wiener theorem has been looked at as a characterization of the image (under Fourier transform) of C∞c functions on the space you are interested in. Recently, using Gutzmer's formula Thangavelu [\cite=T] has proved a Paley-Wiener type result for the inverse Fourier transform. See [\cite=P] also for a similar result.

The plan of this paper is as follows : In the remaining of this section we recall the representation theory and Plancherel theorem of M(2) and we prove the unitarity of the Segal-Bargmann transform. In the next section we study generalized Segal-Bargmann transform and prove an analogue of Theorem 8 and Theorem 10 in [\cite=H]. Third section is devoted to a study of Poisson integrals on M(2). This section is modeled after the work of Goodman [\cite=G1] and [\cite=G2]. In the final section we establish a Paley-Wiener type result for the inverse Fourier transform on M(2).

The rigid motion group M(2) is the semi-direct product of [formula] with SO(2) (which will be identified with the circle group S1) with the group law

[formula]

This group may be identified with a matrix subgroup of [formula] via the map

[formula]

Unitary irreducible representations of M(2) are completely described by Mackey's theory of induced representations. For any [formula] and g∈M(2), we define Uξg as follows :

[formula]

for g  =  (x,r) and F∈L2(S1).

It is known that Uξ is equivalent to Uξ' iff |ξ|  =  |ξ'|. The above collection gives all the unitary irreducible representations of M(2) sufficient for the Plancherel theorem to be true. The Plancherel theorem (see Theorem 4.2 of [\cite=Su]) reads

[formula]

where (ξ) is the 'group Fourier transform' defined as an operator from L2(S1) to L2(S1) by

[formula]

Moreover, the group Fourier Transform (ξ), for [formula] of f∈L1(M(2)) is an integral operator with the kernel kf(ξ,eiα,eiβ) where

[formula]

and [formula] is the Euclidean Fourier Transform of f in the [formula]-variable.

The Lie algebra of M(2) is given by [formula] Let

[formula]

Then it is easy to see that [formula] forms a basis for the Lie algebra of M(2). The "Laplacian" [formula] is defined by

[formula]

A simple computation shows that [formula] where [formula] is the Laplacian on [formula] given by [formula] Since [formula] and [formula] commute, it follows that the heat kernel ψt associated to ΔM(2) is given by the product of the heat kernels pt on [formula] and qt on SO(2). In other words,

[formula]

Let f∈L2(M(2)). Expanding f in the SO(2) variable we obtain

[formula]

where [formula] and the convergence is understood in the L2-sense. Since pt is radial (as a function on [formula]) a simple computation shows that

[formula]

Let [formula] and [formula] be the Hilbert space of holomorphic functions on [formula] which are square integrable with respect to [formula] where

[formula]

and

[formula]

Using the Segal-Bargmann result for [formula] and S1 we can easily prove the following theorem:

If f∈L2(M(2)), then f * pt extends holomorphically to [formula] Moreover, the map f  →  f  *  pt is a unitary map from L2(M(2)) onto [formula]

Generalizations of Segal-Bargmann transform

In this section we study generalizations of the Segal-Bargmann transform and prove an analogue of Theorem 8 and Theorem 10 in [\cite=H].

Let μ be any radial real-valued function on [formula] such that

[formula] and is locally bounded away from zero,

[formula]

Define, for [formula]

[formula]

where a is a real valued measurable function on [formula] Next, let ν be a measure on [formula] such that

ν is S1-invariant,

ν is given by a positive density which is locally bounded away from zero,

[formula]

Define [formula] for [formula] and [formula] such that |cn| = 1. Also define [formula] for [formula] It is easy to see that φ(z,w) is a holomorphic function on [formula] We have the following Paley-Wiener type theorem.

The mapping

[formula]

is an isometric isomorphism of L2(M(2)) onto

[formula]

Let f∈L2(M(2)) and

[formula]

where [formula] Since the function φ(x,eiα), for (x,eiα)∈M(2) is radial in the [formula] variable x, a simple computation shows that the Fourier series of f  *  φ(x,eiα) is given by

[formula]

Now, notice that [formula] and fm  *  ψ is a holomorphic function on [formula] Moreover, by Theorem 8 of [\cite=H] we have

[formula]

Naturally, the analytic continuation of f  *  φ(x,eiα) to [formula] is given by

[formula]

We show that the series in ([\ref=eqn4]) converges uniformly on compact sets in [formula] proving the holomorphicity. Let K be a compact set in [formula] For (z,w)∈K we have

[formula]

By Fourier inversion (see also Theorem 8 in [\cite=H])

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] is the Fourier transform of fm. Hence, if z varies in a compact subset of [formula] we have

[formula]

Using the above in ([\ref=eqn5]) and assuming |w|  ≤  R (as w varies in a compact set in [formula]) we have

[formula]

Applying Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to the above, noting that

[formula]

we prove the above claim. Applying Theorem 10 in [\cite=H] for S1 we obtain

[formula]

Integrating the above against μ(y)dxdy on [formula] and using ([\ref=eqn3]) we obtain that

[formula]

To prove that the map Cφ is surjective it suffices to prove that the range of Cφ is dense in [formula] For this, consider functions of the form f(x,eiα)  =  g(x)eimα∈L2(M(2)) where [formula] Then a simple computation shows that

[formula]

Suppose [formula] be such that

[formula]

[formula] and [formula] From ([\ref=eqn6]) we have

[formula]

which by Theorem 10 of [\cite=H] implies that

[formula]

Finally, an application of Theorem 8 of [\cite=H] shows that [formula] Hence the proof.

Poisson integrals and Paley-Wiener type theorems

In this section we study the Poisson integrals on M(2). We also find conditions on the 'group Fourier transform' of a function so that it extends holomorphically to an appropriate domain in the complexification of the group. We start with the following Gutzmer-type lemma:

Let f∈L2(M(2)) extend holomorphically to the domain

[formula]

and

[formula]

[formula] and N < R. Then

[formula]

provided |y| < t and [formula] Conversely, if

[formula]

then f extends holomorphically to the domain

[formula]

and

[formula]

Notice that [formula] It follows that fn(x) has a holomorphic extension to [formula] and

[formula]

Consequently,

[formula]

Now, for each fixed [formula] with |Imz| < s the function w  →  f(z,w) is holomorphic in the annulus [formula] for every s < t and N < R and so admits a Laurent series expansion

[formula]

It follows that [formula] First part of the lemma is proved now by appealing to the Plancherel theorem on S1 and [formula] Converse can also be proved similarly.

Recall from the introduction that the Laplacian Δ on M(2) is given by [formula] [formula] If f∈L2(M(2)) it is easy to see that

[formula]

We have the following (almost) characterization of the Poisson integrals. Let Ωs denote the domain in [formula] defined by

[formula]

Let f∈L2(M(2)). Then [formula] extends to a holomorphic function on the domain [formula] and

[formula]

Conversely, let g be a holomorphic function on Ωt and

[formula]

Then [formula] such that [formula]

We know that, if f∈L2(M(2)) then

[formula]

Also, [formula] with [formula] If [formula] it is easy to show that

[formula]

It follows that

[formula]

By the previous lemma we prove the first part of the theorem.

Conversely, let g be a holomorphic function on Ωt and

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=lemma] we have

[formula]

Integrating the above over |y| = s < t, we obtain

[formula]

where J0 is the Bessel function of first kind. Noting that J0(i2s|ξ|)  ~  e2s|ξ| for large |ξ| we obtain

[formula]

This surely implies that

[formula]

Defining [formula] by [formula] we obtain

[formula]

and [formula]

A similar result may be proved for the operator [formula]

Analytic vectors

Let π be a unitary representation of a Lie group G on a Hilbert space H. A vector v∈H is called an analytic vector for π if the function g  →  π(g)v is analytic.

Recall the representations Uξg from the introduction. Denote by Uag the representations U(a,0)g for a > 0. If en(θ)  =  einθ∈L2(S1), it is easy to see that en's are analytic vectors for these representations. For g  =  (x,eiα)∈M(2), we have

[formula]

This action of Uag on en can clearly be analytically continued to [formula] and we obtain

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula]

We also note that the action of S1 on [formula] naturally extends to an action of [formula] on [formula] given by

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula]

Our next theorem is in the same spirit of Theorem 3.1 from Goodman [\cite=G2].

Let f∈L2(M(2)). Then f extends holomorphically to [formula] with

[formula]

(where σr is the normalized surface area measure on the sphere [formula]) iff

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] In this case we also have

[formula]

First assume that f∈L2(M(2)) satisfies the transformation property

[formula]

for some fixed [formula] and [formula] As earlier we have

[formula]

By the Hecke-Bochner identity, we have

[formula]

where F2 + 2|m|(g) is the 2 + 2|m|-dimensional Fourier transform of g(x)  =   [formula] considered as a radial function on [formula]

Hence,

[formula]

It follows that (a)en is an analytic vector and we can apply Ua(z,w) to the above. We obtain

[formula]

Thus,

[formula]

Hence,

[formula]

Notice that, if f extends holomorphically to [formula] we must have [formula] because of ([\ref=e1]).

In view of Lemma [\ref=lemma], the above remark and the identity ([\ref=e2]), the theorem is established for functions with transformation property ([\ref=e1]) and we obtain

[formula]

Next, we deal with the general case. For f∈L2(M(2)) define

[formula]

Then fm(eiθx,eiα)  =  eimθfm(x,eiα) and fm's are orthogonal on M(2). Assume that f extends holomorphically to [formula] Then, so does [formula] and we have

[formula]

This follows from the fact that

[formula]

Applying identity ([\ref=e3]) we get from ([\ref=e4])

[formula]

Now, let [formula] denote the inner product in the space of Hilbert-Schmidt operators on L2(S1). Then we notice that

[formula]

Hence ([\ref=e5]) implies that

[formula]

To prove the converse, we first show that f has a holomorphic extension to whole of [formula] Recall that we have

[formula]

Expanding [formula] into Fourier series we have

[formula]

Hence [formula] is given by

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

Notice that J0(2ira)  ~  e2ra for large a and [formula] If e- r  <  |w|  <  er, we obtain

[formula]

which implies

[formula]

Since this is true for all r > 0 and [formula] by Lemma [\ref=lemma] f extends holomorphically to [formula] It follows that fm(x,eiα) defined by

[formula]

also extends holomorphically to [formula] and

[formula]

Now the proof can be completed using the identity ([\ref=e3]), orthogonality of Ua(z,w)(a) (see ([\ref=e6])) and ([\ref=e4]).

A Paley-Wiener theorem for the inverse Fourier transform

Recall from the introduction that the 'group Fourier Transform' (ξ), for [formula] of f∈L1(M(2)) is an integral operator with the kernel kf(ξ,eiα,eiβ) where kf(ξ,eiα,eiβ)  =  (eiβξ,ei(β  -  α)),  ~   being the Euclidean Fourier Transform of f in the [formula]-variable. We have the following Paley-Wiener theorem for the inverse Fourier Transform :

Let f∈L1(M(2)) be such that [formula] and the kernel kf of (ξ) is smooth on [formula] Then x  →  f(x,eiα) extends to an entire function of exponential type R such that

[formula]

Conversely, if f extends to an entire function on [formula] in the first variable and satisfies ([\ref=eqn1]) then (ξ)  =  0 for |ξ| > R and kf is smooth on [formula].

We have

[formula]

where kf(ξ,eiα,eiβ)  =  (eiβξ,ei(β  -  α)).

Assume that [formula] Since kf is smooth we have [formula] By the Paley-Wiener theorem on [formula] we obtain that f(  ·  ,eiα) extends to an entire function on [formula] of exponential type. Moreover, if [formula]

[formula]

It follows that

[formula]

Conversely, if f is holomorphic on [formula] and satisfies ([\ref=eqn1]), by the Paley-Wiener theorem on [formula] we get [formula] and [formula] Hence [formula] Moreover, kf is smooth on [formula] since [formula] is smooth.
