Pencil of irreducible rational curves and Plane Jacobian conjecture

1. The mysterious Jacobian Conjecture (see [\cite=Bass] and [\cite=Essen-book] for its history and surveys), posed first by Ott-Heinrich Keller [\cite=Keller] since 1939 and remains open even for the case n = 2, asserts that every polynomial map F of [formula] satisfying the Jacobian condition [formula] is invertible, and hence, is a polynomial automorphism of [formula]. The following results, which appeared in the literature in some convenient statements, characterize the invertibility of non-zero constant Jacobian polynomial maps F in terms of the topology of inverse images F- 1(l) of the complex lines [formula],

Let F be a polynomial map of  [formula] with non-zero constant Jacobian, [formula]. Then,

F is invertible if the inverse images F- 1(l) of complex lines [formula] having same a fixed direction are irreducible rational curves, and

F is invertible if for generic point [formula] the inverse images F- 1(l) of complex lines [formula] passing through q are irreducible rational curves.

Here, we mean an irreducible rational curve to be an algebraic curve homeomorphic to the 2-dimensional sphere with a finite number of punctures.

Theorem 1 (ii), due to Nollet and Xavier (Corollary 1.3, [\cite=NF]), is deduced from a deep result on the holomorphic injectivity (Theorem 1.1, in [\cite=NF]). Theorem 1 (i) appears earlier with algebraic and algebra-geometric proofs in Razar [\cite=Razas], Le and Weber [\cite=LeWe2], Friedland [\cite=Friedland], and Heitmann [\cite=Heitmann] for n = 2, and in Nemethi and Sigray [\cite=NemethiSigray] for general case. In fact, as observed by Vistoli [\cite=Vistoli] and by Neumann and Norbudy [\cite=NeumannNorbudy], non-trivial rational polynomials in two variable must have reducible fibres.

In this short article we would like to note that in certain cases the invertibility of polynomial map F = (P,Q) of [formula] with finite fibres can be characterized by the irreducibility and rationality of the curves aP + bQ = 0, [formula]. Our result is

Let F = (P,Q) be a polynomial map of [formula] with finite fibres such that all of the curves aP + bQ = 0, [formula], are irreducible and rational. Then, the followings are equivalent

(0,0) is a regular value of F;

[formula];

F is invertible.

Theorem [\ref=Main] leads to a little surprise that for the case n = 2 Theorem 1 (ii) is still valid without the Jacobian condition.

Let F be a polynomial map of [formula] with finite fibres. If for generic points [formula] the inverse images F- 1(l) of complex lines [formula] passing through q are irreducible rational curves, then F is invertible.

Since the fibres of F are finite, we have [formula]. Then, by the assumptions we can assume that (0,0) is a regular value of F and for all lines l passing through (0,0) the inverse images F- 1(l) are irreducible rational curves. Hence, by Theorem [\ref=Main] the map F is invertible.

In attempt to understand the plane Jacobian conjecture it is worth to consider the questions:

Does the Jacobian condition ensure the irreducibility of all of the curves aP + bQ = 0, [formula] ?

Is a non-zero constant Jacobian polynomial map F = (P,Q) of [formula] invertible if all of the curves aP + bQ = 0, [formula], are irreducible ?

Kaliman [\cite=Kaliman93] observe that to prove the plane Jacobian conjecture it is sufficient to consider non-zero constant Jacobian polynomial maps F = (P,Q), in which all of fibres P = c, [formula], are irreducible. Relating to Question 2 note that the only irreducibility of the curves aP + bQ = 0, [formula], does not not guaranty the invertibility of the polynomial map F = (P,Q). For example, the map F(x,y) = (x,x2 + y3) is not invertible, but the curves ax + b(x2 + y3) = 0, [formula], are irreducible. Further deep examinations on the relation between the Jacobian condition and the geometry of the pencil of curves aP + bQ = 0 would be useful in the pursuit for the solution of the plane Jacobian problem.

The proof of Theorem [\ref=Main] will be carried out in $3 after some necessary preparations in $ 2.

2. From now on F = (P,Q), is a given polynomial map of [formula] with finite fibres. Our proof of Theorem [\ref=Main] is based on the facts below.

i) Following [\cite=Jelonek], by the non-propoer value set AF of F we mean the set of all values [formula] such that a is the limit set of F(vk) for a sequence [formula] tending to ∞  . The set AF is a plane curve composed of the images of some polynomial maps from [formula] into [formula] [\cite=Jelonek]. When F has finite fibres, by definitions

[formula]

where deg wF is the multiplicity of F at w and deg geo.F is the number of solutions of the equation F = v for generic points [formula]. In the case when F satisfies the Jacobian condition we have

Let F = (P,Q) be a non-zero constant Jacobian polynomial map. Then, the irreducible components of AF, if exists, can be parameterized by polynomial maps t  ↦  (φ(t),ψ(t)), [formula], satisfying

[formula]

In particular, AF can never contains components isomorphic to the line [formula].

ii) Let [formula] for [formula] and denote by rλ the number of irreducible components of the curve Dλ. Regarding the plane [formula] as a subset of the projective plane [formula], we can associate to F the rational map [formula] given by [formula] which is well defined outside the finite set B: = F- 1(0,0) and a possible finite subset of the line at infinity of [formula]. We can extend G to a regular morphism [formula] from a compactification X of [formula] to [formula]. By a horizontal component (constant component) of G we mean an irreducible component [formula] of the divisor [formula] such that the restriction gl of g to l is a non-constant mapping (res. constant mapping). Let us denote by hG the number of horizontal components l of g. The number hG is depended on P and Q, but not on the compactification X of [formula].

We can construct such extension [formula] by a minimal sequence of the blowing-ups [formula] that removes all of the indeterminacy points of the rational map G. In such an extension g the divisor D is the disjoint union of the connected divisors D∞: = π- 1(L∞) and Db: = π- 1(b), b∈B, where L∞ indicates the line at infinity of [formula]. Denotes by h∞ and hb the numbers of horizontal components of G contained in the divisors D∞ and Db, b∈B, respectively. Obviously,

[formula]

and

[formula]

If the generic curve Dλ is irreducible and rational, then

[formula]

The equality (4) is a folklore fact which can be reduced from the estimation on the total reducibility order of pencils of curves obtained by Vistoli in [\cite=Vistoli]. The proof presented below is quite elementary and is analogous to those of Kaliman [\cite=Kaliman92] for the total reducibility order of polynomials in two variables.

Fixed a regular morphism g which is a blowing-up version of G. Let Cλ be the fiber g = λ, [formula], and let C be a generic fiber of g. We will use Suzuki's formula [\cite=Suzuki]

[formula]

Here, χ(V) indicates the Euler-Poincare characteristic of V.

Let us denote by m the number of irreducible components of the divisor D and by mλ the number of irreducible components of Cλ contained in D. Then, we have χ(X) = m + 2 and

[formula]

Since the generic curves Dλ are irreducible and rational the generic fibre C of g is a copy [formula] and the fibres Cλ are connected rational curves with simple normal crossing. Therefore, χ(C) = 2 and χ(Cλ) = rλ + mλ + 1.

Now, by the above estimations we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

Putting (6) and (7) into (5) we get the desired equality (4).

iii) Regarding polynomials P and Q as rational maps from [formula] into [formula], the blowing-up [formula] in (ii) also provides natural extensions [formula] of P and Q, which may have some indeterminacy points. If necessary, we can replace X by its convenient blowing-up version so that p and q are regular morphisms and [formula] is a regular extension of F.

The restrictions of p and q to each irreducible component l  ⊂  D then determine holomorphic maps from l to [formula], denoted by pl and ql respectively. We can divide horizontal components l of G into some following types:

l  ⊂  Db. Then, [formula]

l  ⊂  D∞. Then, either

a) [formula],

b) [formula], or

c) (pl,ql) is a non-constant mapping with (pl:ql)  ≠  const. .

Obvious, in Type (IIc) [formula].

By dicritical component of F we mean an irreducible component l  ⊂  D∞ such that (pl,ql) is a non-constant mapping. Obviously, by the definitions

[formula]

In particular, F is a proper map of [formula] if and only if F does not have dicritical components.

We have

G has at least one horizontal component of Type (IIa);

If [formula], then G has at least one horizontal component of Types (IIb) or Type (IIc). If (0,0)∈AF, then G has at least one horizontal component of Type (IIb);

If l is a dicritical component of F, then either l is a horizontal component of G or [formula] is a line passing through (0,0).

a) Note that each generic fiber Cλ is the union of Dλ and a finite number of points lying in horizontal components of f, at which the rational map (p,q) is well defined. If f does not have horizontal components of Type (IIa), the map (p,q) would obtains finite values on [formula], and hence, P and Q would be constant on each connected component of Dλ. This is impossible, since the fibres of F are finite.

b) By definitions the non-proper value set AF can be expressed as [formula] Assume [formula]. Let V be an irreducible component of AF. Then, the inverse f- 1(V) must contains a component l of D∞ such that V  ⊂  f(l). Obviously, [formula] or [formula]. Therefore, l is a horizontal component of Type (IIc) of G , except when (0,0)∈AF and V is a line passing through (0,0). In the case (0,0)∈AF, the intersection [formula] is not empty. Then, f maps each neighborhood U of D onto a neighborhood of (0,0), and hence, g maps such neighborhood U onto [formula]. It follows that D must contains a horizontal component of Type (IIb) of G. The conclusions now are clear.

c) Let l be a dicritical component of F, (pl,ql)  ≠  const. . By definitions, l is either a horizontal component of G if (pl:ql)  ≠  const. or a component of a fiber of g. Obviously, in the late case [formula] is a line passing through (0,0).

cm 3. Now, we are ready to prove Theorem [\ref=Main].

Let F = (P,Q) be a given polynomial map [formula] with finite fibres satisfying that all of the curves aP + bQ = 0, [formula], are irreducible and rational. The implication (c)  ⇒  (a;b) is trivial. We need to prove only (a)  ⇒  (c) and (b)  ⇒  (c). We will use same constructions and notations presented for F = (P,Q) in the previous sections.

First, by assumptions we can apply Lemma [\ref=Lem1] to see that G has exactly two horizontal components,

[formula]

Since h∞ > 0 and hb > 0 for b∈B by Lemma [\ref=Lem2], from (8) it follows that either

h∞ = 2 and [formula], or

h∞ = 1, B consists of an unique point, say B = {b}, and hb = 1.

(a)  ⇒  (c). Assume that (0,0) is a regular value of F, i.e F- 1(0,0) is non-empty and does not contain singular points of F. So, we drop into Situation (ii): h∞ = 1, B = {b} and hb = 1. Then, by Lemma [\ref=Lem2] (a) the unique horizontal component of G in D∞ must be in Type (IIa). It follows that F does not have dicritical component, [formula]. This means that F is a proper map of [formula], or equivalent [formula]. Then, by (4) the geometric degree deg geo.F of F is equal to the number of solutions of the equation F(x,y) = 0, counted with multiplicity. But, this equation accepts b as an unique solution and b is not singular point of F. Thus, deg geo.F = 1 and hence F is injective. Then, by the well-known fact (see [\cite=Essen-book]) that polynomial injections of [formula] are automorphisms the map F must be invertible.

(b)  ⇒  (c). Assume [formula]. If [formula], the value (0,0) then is a regular value of F and we are done by the previous part. Assume the contrary that [formula]. Then, we drop into Situation (i): h∞ = 2 and [formula]. In this case, by definitions (0,0) is a non-proper value of F, (0,0)∈AF. Therefore, by Lemma [\ref=Lem2] (a) and (b) G has exactly two horizontal components, one is of Type (IIa) and one is of Type (IIb). In particular, none of such horizontal components can be a dicritical component of F. Hence, by Lemma [\ref=Lem2] (c) AF must be composed of some lines passing through (0,0). This contradicts to Theorem 4. Thus, F is invertible.
