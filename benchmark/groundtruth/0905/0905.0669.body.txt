Unitary circuits for strongly correlated fermions

Strongly correlated quantum lattice models still pose some of the most intriguing problems in quantum physics, presumably being at the basis of phenomena such as high-temperature superconductivity [\cite=Vojta]. To describe such models theoretically is often very difficult, an obvious obstacle being the prohibitive dimension of Hilbert space even for moderately sized systems when naively representing ground states. In recent years, it has increasingly become clear, however, that typical ground states of physically meaningful local models are lurking in some corner of Hilbert space, one that can often even be identified [\cite=Area] [\cite=Scholl] [\cite=White] [\cite=PEPS1] [\cite=PEPS2] [\cite=MERA1] [\cite=Flow] [\cite=Rizzi] [\cite=MERAFreeFermions] [\cite=2D] [\cite=Homogeneous]. Hence to faithfully describe such a state, even though it may be impossible to parametrize the entire physical space, one merely has to parametrize those quantum states from the relevant set, requiring significantly fewer parameters. The most prominent and, to date, most powerful incarnation of this idea is provided by the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method [\cite=White] [\cite=Scholl], requiring only linearly many parameters in the system size, but still giving an exceptionally good description of gapped one-dimensional spin chains and a very reasonable one for critical chains.

To realize such an idea in higher-dimensional systems is significantly more difficult, although progress has been made in recent years [\cite=PEPS1] [\cite=PEPS2] [\cite=Rage] [\cite=MERA1] [\cite=Flow] [\cite=Rizzi] [\cite=MERAFreeFermions] [\cite=2D] [\cite=Homogeneous] [\cite=Area] [\cite=Scholl], specifically when it comes to generalizing DMRG ideas to higher dimensions, including variations of tensor product states or projected entangled pair states, variants with graph enhancement, or the promising multiscale entanglement renormalization (MERA). This is a scale-invariant approach related to renormalization that has been proposed in Ref. [\cite=MERA1] and implemented in Refs. [\cite=Flow] [\cite=Rizzi] [\cite=MERAFreeFermions] [\cite=Homogeneous] [\cite=2D]. Area laws [\cite=Area] often point to the part of Hilbert space that is being occupied.

To describe higher dimensional fermionic systems, such as the Fermi-Hubbard model itself [\cite=Vojta], in such a fashion, appears particularly promising, but also particularly challenging. Here, other key methods of describing quantum lattice models like the powerful quantum Monte Carlo method are hampered by the sign problem [\cite=QMC]. Surely, fermionic models can readily be represented as spin models, yet at the expense of losing locality (or by increasing the locality region of Hamiltonians [\cite=Mapping]). If one considers the term [formula], j < k, then its spin representation under the Jordan-Wigner transformation (JWT) is For a pair of nearest-neighbor sites 〈j,k〉 on a d  ×  d lattice, the occurring string operator that is supported not only on the spins associated with j and k, but in fact on all spins between j and k, will typically have a length linear in d. It should be clear that no order can be chosen to let this apparent problem disappear.

In this work, we present a method for studying strongly correlated fermionic models using quantum circuits, that is, circuits of fermionic gates, in a way that is not overburdened by string operators: When describing the system and computing local expectation values, one has to deal with operators having support identical to that of a corresponding spin system (fermionic gates of the circuit replaced by regular ones), and strings can be made to disappear. The key point is to acknowledge that while any fixed order will give rise to the aforementioned problem, we are not necessarily forced to pick any order in the first place. Instead, one can employ a dynamical reordering of the fermionic modes in the essential part of the lattice, reordering and projecting out particles "on the fly," in dynamical JWTs. We show that this can be consistently done, not altering expectation values of parity-preserving operators. In this way, we find that to describe fermionic lattice models is, in this sense, just as hard or easy as describing spin models. More formally, the contraction complexity of the circuit is the same.

Fermions. We first prepare the ground of the dynamical reordering idea. The algebra G(L) of a set of n fermionic modes is spanned by products of anticommuting fermionic operators [formula], with {fj,fk} = 0, [formula]. Physical operators form the subalgebra F(L), the so-called physical algebra, of operators respecting the fermion number parity [\cite=TerhalKitaev] [\cite=Fermions]. In practical terms, this means that they are even polynomials in the fermionic creation and annihilation operators. Hence, the physical algebra splits into a direct sum of an even and an odd part, [formula]. For a subset I  ⊂  L of some sites, one similarly finds the physical algebra F(I).

Fermionic unitary circuits and multiscale entanglement renormalization. A fermionic unitary is a parity-preserving unitary gate acting on fermionic modes, U =  exp (iH), where H∈F(L) is a hermitian operator. In a circuit [\cite=MERA1] [\cite=Flow] [\cite=Rizzi] [\cite=MERAFreeFermions], unitaries will typically not have support on the entire lattice, but will be local; that is, it will have a small support I independent of n such that U∈F(I). A fermionic unitary circuit is an ordered product of fermionic unitaries. For most of this work, we in fact consider conjugation, in particular for the evaluation of expectation values of local observables A∈F(L), with respect to states that have been prepared by applying a fermionic unitary circuit to the vacuum |ø〉,

[formula]

or by applying it to some other with odd fermion number parity, for example, [formula] instead of |ø〉. In fact, there is a natural discrete time label t in a circuit, in that [formula] labels the time at which a single gate is being applied. What is more, we focus on circuits that feature a causal cone (see Fig. [\ref=Fig1]), most prominently present in the MERA in the original sense of Ref. [\cite=MERA1]: The cone is formed by those unitaries in a circuit that cannot be sequentially canceled with their conjugates from the dual vector in Eq. ([\ref=E]) due to the presence of a local observable A that is supported only on a few sites, typically nearest neighbors. Efficient schemes will have a causal cone of a fixed width, in that a local operator will only touch a constant number of unitaries for each time step. The sequence of sequentially computing the expectation values respecting the discrete time order gives rise to a contraction. We can also allow for tensors different from unitary gates and partial traces. We also allow time steps where partial projections are applied onto the fermionic vacuum in some mode.

We now turn to aspects that are specific for fermions. A first key property from the elements of disjoint subalgebras U∈F(I) and V∈F(J), [formula], respecting parity, is that their elements commute, = 0. This has the important consequence that just as for spin systems, all unitaries outside a causal cone can be canceled, and the fermionic variant inherits the same cone as the spin system. We now see that the computation of the expectation value Eq. ([\ref=E]) can be done without having to deal with string operators outside the cone.

Jordan-Wigner transformations. Fermionic operators are encoded in an occupation number representation, a representation necessarily depending on the chosen order of the fermionic modes. As we will later make updates with different fermionic orderings at different times, it makes sense to first highlight the status of the JWT. For the entire system L one can take some order O corresponding to an element of the symmetric group Sn, for example the trivial order [formula]. For this order O, a basis for the Hilbert space is given in the occupation number representation, [formula], giving an identification of the total Hilbert space with the [formula], the Hilbert space of n spins 1 / 2. Expressing fermionic operators in the occupation number representation amounts to a map JO:G(L)  →  M(L), where M(L) is the algebra of linear operators on [formula]. This map is the well-known JWT, depending on L and the chosen order O∈Sn of the fermionic modes; for example,

[formula]

where σx,y,zk denote the familiar Pauli operators and σ+j  =  (σxj  +  iσyj) / 2. In this light, a JWT simply gives fermionic operators in the occupation number (or spin) representation for a given ordering O. We hence identify local fermionic operators with non-local operators in the respective spin systems. Also, physical operators contain strings that depend on the order chosen. Consider a local physical operator acting on sites I, the spin representation will in general also be supported on the spins in between with respect to order O. For example, for the local fermionic number operator one finds [formula], but the occupation number representation of [formula]

[formula]

with j < k, contains a string of Pauli operators on
