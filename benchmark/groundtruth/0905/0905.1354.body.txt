On a transition from solar-like coronae to rotation-dominated jovian-like magnetospheres in ultracool main-sequence stars

Introduction

Main sequence stars have a convective envelope around a radiative core from about spectral type A2 (with an effective temperature of Teff  ≈  9000 K) to about M3 (Teff  ≈  3200 K). Stars warmer than about F2 (Teff  ≈  7000 K) have but a shallow convective envelope that sustains at most weak magnetic activity. As one of these stars, the Sun exhibits many of the properties of the magnetically-driven variability of the population of F2-M3 dwarf stars. The radiative losses from their chromospheres, transition regions and coronae generally decrease with age as stars lose angular momentum through a magnetized wind. The radiative losses from these distinct thermal domains scale through power laws with the average magnetic flux density on the stellar surface. All of these stars exhibit signatures of flaring that increase with increasing quiescent activity. The radio emission from all of these stars, albeit generally weak, scales lineary with the coronal X-ray emission, suggestive of persistent non-thermal energetic-particle populations within their outer atmospheres (e.g., [\citeauthor=schrijver+zwaan99], [\citeyear=schrijver+zwaan99], and references therein; see [\citeauthor=berger+etal2008], [\citeyear=berger+etal2008], for a recent version of the radio/X-ray scaling).

Stars cooler than about M2 to M4 are expected to be fully convective ([\citeauthor=chabrier+baraffe2000], [\citeyear=chabrier+baraffe2000]), lacking the convective overshoot layer and tachocline that are thought to be important to the solar dynamo. Yet these stars are capable of generating magnetic field, with a rotation-activity relationship that continues clearly to at least spectral type M8 (e.g., [\citeauthor=mohanti+etal2002], [\citeyear=mohanti+etal2002], [\citeauthor=reiners+basri2009], [\citeyear=reiners+basri2009]). However, their magnetic field appears to be a predominantly axi-symmetrical large-scale poloidal field with at most a slow evolution in the surface pattern ([\citeauthor=donati+etal2008], [\citeyear=donati+etal2008]; also [\citeauthor=reiners+basri2009], [\citeyear=reiners+basri2009]), in contrast to warmer stars that show relatively-rapidly evolving, non-axisymmetric fields evolving subject to flux emergence and differential rotation.

Spectra of FeH lines reveal that stars at least down to M9 have magnetic fields, and that the coolest stars beyond M6 for which fields can be measured have magnetic flux densities of fB = 1.5 kG or more (e.g., [\citeauthor=berger+etal2008a], [\citeyear=berger+etal2008a], [\citeauthor=hallinan+etal2006], [\citeyear=hallinan+etal2006] and 2007, [\citeauthor=reiners+basri2007], [\citeyear=reiners+basri2007]. X-ray flaring has been reported down to at least M9.5 (e.g., [\citeauthor=liebert+etal1999], [\citeyear=liebert+etal1999], [\citeauthor=reid+etal99], [\citeyear=reid+etal99], [\citeauthor=fleming+etal2003], [\citeyear=fleming+etal2003], [\citeauthor=berger+etal2008], [\citeyear=berger+etal2008]).

Beyond about M8, the relationship between chromospheric (Hα) or coronal (X-ray) emission and rotation rate becomes a weak tendency and even that disappears beyond L0 (e.g., [\citeauthor=reiners+basri2009], [\citeyear=reiners+basri2009], [\citeauthor=basri2008], [\citeyear=basri2008]; see [\citeauthor=mohanti+basri2003], [\citeyear=mohanti+basri2003], for a discussion of difficulties in assigning spectral types). Whereas essentially all stars of spectral type M8 have strong Hα emission, this drops to 60% at L0, ≈  15% at L4, and to less than than ≈  10% by L5 (e.g., [\citeauthor=mohanti+etal2002], [\citeyear=mohanti+etal2002], [\citeauthor=mohanti+basri2003], [\citeyear=mohanti+basri2003], [\citeauthor=west+etal2004], [\citeyear=west+etal2004], [\citeauthor=reiners2007], [\citeyear=reiners2007], [\citeauthor=reiners+basri2007], [\citeyear=reiners+basri2007], [\citeauthor=schmidt+etal2007], [\citeyear=schmidt+etal2007]).

In contrast to the weakening of the rotation-activity relationship for the traditional chromospheric (Hα) and coronal (X-ray) indicators of magnetic activity beyond about M8, the radio luminosity continues to increase with increasing angular velocity up to at least L0 ([\citeauthor=berger+etal2008], [\citeyear=berger+etal2008]), with (often variable) radio emission detected to at least L3.5 ([\citeauthor=berger2006], [\citeyear=berger2006]). Interestingly, the essentially linear relationship between radio and X-ray luminosities for all other cool stars breaks down beyond M5, with the X-ray luminosity dropping by a factor of about 3,000 below that relationship at a given radio luminosity by spectral type L0 ([\citeauthor=berger+etal2008], [\citeyear=berger+etal2008]).

The reduction of the traditional diagnostics for chromospheric and coronal activity, the weakening of their dependence on rotation rate despite the presence of strong magnetic fields, and the increase in time scale for rotational braking (discussed in Sect. 4), may have their origin in the very low degree of ionization of the photospheric plasma. [\citeauthor=mohanti+etal2002] ([\citeyear=mohanti+etal2002]) argue that beyond M5, the photospheric plasma is weakly coupled to the magnetic field, and the high resistivity and associated diffusivity of the plasma should render it very difficult to generate electrical currents by convection-driven field motions or to transmit any generated in the stellar interior to the corona (see also [\citeauthor=mohanti+basri2003], [\citeyear=mohanti+basri2003], who also discuss the role of dust in these cool atmospheres). The persistence of radio emission into the L-type range, despite these changes in activity characteristic of all other cool stars, suggests we explore a fundamental change in the character of stellar magnetic activity: the weakening of a well-developed convection-powered stellar corona and associated stellar wind may cause the stellar outer atmosphere to change from a solar-like corona with heliosphere to a Jupiter-like magnetosphere shaped by the incoming wind of the interstellar medium (ISM) impinging on the stellar magnetic field, while powered by the stellar rotation.

Radiative and rotational energy losses

Coronal emission and magnetic braking both weaken rapidly beyond mid-M. Up to about spectral type L0, the energy lost by rotational braking appears to be consistent with that expected from a solar-like coronal domain beneath an outflowing wind, as can be seen from the following argument. I start from the premise that the stellar atmosphere is essentially hydrostatically stratified. Near the stellar surface, an isothermal plasma has a pressure scale height

[formula]

with stellar radius [formula], temperature T, proton mass mp, and gravitational constant G. Here, I assume a pure hydrogen gas for an order-of-magnitude estimate. The constant a = 1 for a neutral gas, and a = 2 for fully-ionized hydrogen. A largely-neutral photospheric gas of T = 2000 K on a compact ultra-cool star with surface gravity [formula] cm/s2 would have Hp(2000  K)  ~  9 km.

In order to lead to magnetic braking, plasma of sufficient density needs to exist out to the lesser of the Alfvén radius (to which corotation of star and high-atmospheric plasma is enforced) and the radius of synchronous rotation (beyond which centrifugal forces dominate). The latter (which is likely the smaller of the two for rapidly-rotating L-type dwarf stars) is

[formula]

for stellar mass [formula] and angular velocity Ω = 2π / P, at rotation period P. The characteristic value of [formula] (see Table 1) is so much larger than Hp(2000  K) that the plasma density at RS would be insufficient to lead to significant angular momentum loss.

For a plasma at coronal temperatures the density scale height is much higher, of course. Only very few stars beyond M9 have been detected in X-rays (e.g., [\citeauthor=audard+etal2007], [\citeyear=audard+etal2007], [\citeauthor=robrade+schmitt2008], [\citeyear=robrade+schmitt2008]). Their quiescent emissions are at a level of about LX / Lbol  ~  10- 4, or log (LX)  ~  25.5, while others have even lower upper limits.

Assuming a hydrostatically stratified atmosphere, the electron density ne associated with such an emission can be estimated from the X-ray luminosity LX based on the plasma's volumetric emission, n2eΛ(TC), and characteristic volume, [formula],

[formula]

for a plasma at temperature TC, with an emissivity Λ(TC)  ≈  2  ×  10- 18T- 2 / 3 (for log (TC)∈[5.5,7.5]); for TC = 1.5 MK, comparable to that of the bulk of the solar wind and consistent with the very-limited X-ray spectral information available on L-type dwarf stars ([\citeauthor=robrade+schmitt2008], [\citeyear=robrade+schmitt2008]), Λ(1.5  MK)  ~  10- 21.8 (e.g., [\citeauthor=schrijver+zwaan99], [\citeyear=schrijver+zwaan99]). The coronal-base density thus estimated for L-type stars with log (LX)  ~  25.5 and TC = 1.5 MK is n0  ~  108.8 cm- 3.

To estimate the plasma density at height RS within the equatorial plane, the density for an isothermal atmosphere can be approximated from a balance between pressure gradient, gravity, and centrifugal acceleration:

[formula]

(note that the stratification of a subsonic wind is very similar to a static stratified atmosphere, e.g., [\citeauthor=hpI-9], [\citeyear=hpI-9]). With the above value of n0, n(RS)  ≈  105.6 - 5.8 cm- 3 for the characteristic L2 and L5 stars in Table 1 (the centrifugal force below RS modifies the density profile by a factor of [formula] relative to the stratification in the absence of rotation).

Now assume that the centrifugal force beyond RS accelerates plasma outward, which is replenished from below at (at most) the thermal velocity

[formula]

for adiabatic index γ, so that the upper limit for the mass loss is

[formula]

with α a geometry factor. If the mass loss were isotropic, [formula], but as mass is probably lost from only part of the surface area, I use α = 1 / 2 below.

The stellar magnetic field can enforce corotation out to a distance RA where the plasma β becomes of order unity, given by

[formula]

if the field is approximated by a dipole of characteristic strength B0 at the stellar surface; n(r) is assumed to be given by Eq. ([\ref=eq:strat]).

Outflowing plasma in a spherical shell carries an angular momentum

[formula]

and a rotational energy of

[formula]

With the values in Table 1, one finds WC  ≈  1025.8 erg/s for log (LX)  ~  25.5. For the characteristic L2 star in Table 1, this compares well to the estimated loss Wrot from rotation-age studies (see Sect. 4), so that we can conclude that the existence of a faint thermal corona in early L-type stars is compatible with the inferred magnetic braking.

The estimatd WC is while about an order of magnitude larger than Wrot for the M7 dwarf star. This may be because of the exponential dependence WC on TC, or because the corona of the M7 star may be solar-like, in the sense that a few relatively bright and dense regions dominate the emission, so that the base density from Eq. ([\ref=eq:densityestimate]) would be an overestimate for the highest coronal loops.

The estimates in this section obviously depend on the assumed values of LX and TC. The value of WC scales with LX about as a square root, so that our conclusions are not strongly modified if the characteristic value of LX observed for the L-dwarf binary Kelu-1 is somewhat larger than what is characteristic of the ensemble of similar L-type dwarf stars. The dependence on TC is much stronger, not surprisingly, because of the near-exponential stratification of density in units of the pressure scale height: for TC = 1 - 3 MK, log (Wrot) = 24.2 - 27.3.

The magnetosphere of the coolest dwarf stars

Even though magnetic braking remains compatible with the concept of a hot corona, the radio emission in ultracool dwarfs is disproportionally strong. One possible cause for this that should be explored, and can then be ruled out, is the interaction with the ISM. Observations suggest that there is relatively little heated coronal plasma well into the L-type spectral range, there should not be much of an associated stellar wind either. The motion of a star with at most a weak wind relative to the ISM should lead to the formation of a magnetopause. The energy input into the stellar magnetosphere from this interaction is expected to be low, based on the following.

The standoff (or Chapman-Ferraro) distance of the magnetopause is set by where the dynamic pressure ρwv2w of the ISM wind with density ρw and relative velocity vw equals the magnetic pressure of the stellar field. Observations suggest that the large-scale field of very cool dwarf stars can be approximated by a dipole field, so that the field scales with μ / r3, with the magnetic moment [formula], where [formula] is the field strength near the stellar equator. RCF for a late M-type or L-type dwarf star can thus be estimated from [formula], or:

[formula]

The constant of proportionality is determined by using the observation that for Earth [formula] Earth radii ([\citeauthor=russell2007], [\citeyear=russell2007]), for a wind speed of v100  ~  4 (in units of 100 km/s) and a characteristic solar-wind particle density n0 = 10 cm- 3 ([\citeauthor=feldman+etal1977], [\citeyear=feldman+etal1977]), and BG  ~  0.6 G for the Earth's polar field strength ([\citeauthor=allen72], [\citeyear=allen72]).

The relative motion of stars through the ISM averages about 40 km/s for a sample of very cool dwarf stars (e.g., [\citeauthor=wood+etal2005], [\citeyear=wood+etal2005], [\citeauthor=schmidt+etal2007], [\citeyear=schmidt+etal2007]). For a hypothetical dwarf star that has no stellar wind, that moves through an ISM like that around the solar system with n0 = 0.1 (e.g., [\citeauthor=wood+etal2002], [\citeyear=wood+etal2002]) at v100 = 0.4, and BG = 1.5 kG, one finds [formula]; that relative scale is similar to the geometry in the case of Jupiter's magnetosphere, for which RMP / RJ = 42 (e.g., [\citeauthor=walker+russell1995], [\citeyear=walker+russell1995]).

To estimate how much power the ISM wind might impart onto a stellar bowshock and potentially into the stellar magnetosphere, we estimate the power in the bulk kinetic energy over the cross section of the bow shock with cross section πR2CF:

[formula]

so that at n0 = 0.1, v100 = 0.4, and [formula], Pw  ≈  1020 - 22 erg/s for characteristic M7 to L5 stars. This lies orders of magnitude below the Hα and X-ray luminosities (see Table 1) and below the power that needs to be extracted from the stellar rotation with age (see below). Hence, the ISM wind is not a significant source of magnetospheric activity in dwarf stars through mid-L, even if it shapes a close-in asteropause.

From a stellar corona to a planetary magnetosphere

As the solar-like corona fades away from mid-M to mid-L, one may expect increasing signatures of a rotation-dominated magnetosphere towards late L-type stars like that for Jupiter. In such a magnetosphere, energy is taken from star's rotational energy through a torque applied by outflowing plasma. The energy loss, Wrot, can be estimated from the rotation-age relationship. [\citeauthor=reiners+basri2008] ([\citeyear=reiners+basri2008]) infer time scales for magnetic braking that increase from about 3 Gyr for an M7 star to 7 Gyr for an L2 star, and over 10 Gyr for an L5 star (the latter is relatively poorly constrained and, perhaps, much larger). Using

[formula]

yeidls Wrot  ~  1026 ergs/s (Table 1). In the early L-type range, this is comparable to WC from Eq. ([\ref=eq:wc]) that could be taken away by the outflow from the relatively weak corona, i.e., that would be plausibly consistent with the existence of such a weak corona. But both Wrot and WC exceed X-ray and Hα losses, i.e., the rotational energy loss exceeds the radiative losses, in contrast to what is seen in warmer solar-type stars.

Let us now explore an order-of-magnitude scaling for the power expected from a rotationally-dominated magnetosphere. [\citeauthor=fan+etal1982] ([\citeyear=fan+etal1982]) argue for a scaling based on a dimensional analysis ('principle of similitude') that relates the magnetic moment, [formula], the rotation period, P, and the radius, Ra, at which the acceleration process begins to the power, [formula], generated:

[formula]

where the constant K has to follow from a measurement until a full theory is developed. Based on the properties in Table [\ref=tab:table], using a mean photosperic field strength of 1.5 kG, and with RS for Ra, values are found for [formula] of 0.6, 0.4, and 0.6 for the characteristic M7, L2, and L5 stars, respectively. [\citeauthor=fan+etal1982] ([\citeyear=fan+etal1982]) estimate a range of values for the constant 10 log (K) for Jupiter from - 1.7 to - 0.7. The value of K for Jupiter lies, remarkably, within the range of values needed to let Wrot and [formula] be comparable for the stars in Table 1. In contrast, this scaling applied to the Sun yields [formula], which is well over a thousand times less. At least [formula] for ultracool dwarfs is much larger than the solar value, while with the only available calibration point - Jupiter - one concludes that [formula] is close to both Wrot and WC for an early L-type star.

Discussion and conclusions

Somewhere along the spectrum of stars, brown dwarfs, and planets a transition from an outflow-driven asterosphere to a field-shielded rotating magnetosphere must occur. Based on the observational evidence, I argue that this transition occurs at the bottom end of the true stellar range of the main sequence: for stars cooler than about spectral type M5, the properties characteristic of solar-like activity progressively disappear, while, in contrast to warmer stars, magnetic braking extracts more energy from the star than needed to power the chromospheric Hα and (weak) coronal X-ray emissions. Objects cooler than about L0-L2 may exhibit outer-atmospheric phenomena similar to those in the rotation-driven magnetosphere of Jupiter rather than to those in convection-driven corona and wind of the Sun.

The energetics of the main auroral oval of Jupiter dominate over the phenomena associated with the lower-latitude structures that are connected directly with the movement of Io, Europa, and Ganymede through the jovian magnetic field, and those associated with the higher-latitude polar-cap emissions that appear to be driven by the solar wind. Jupiter's main auroral oval is not - in contrast to Earth's - the separator between open and closed planetary magnetic field in the interaction with the interplanetary magnetic field, but instead is mapped to lower-latitude closed magnetic field (see, e.g., the summarizing discussion by [\citeauthor=cowley+etal2003], [\citeyear=cowley+etal2003]). This auroral structure is thought to be generated by the precipitation of energetic electrons created by the electric current system that is involved in a phenomenon referred to as "corotation" (or rather the breakdown thereof) in the middle magnetosphere: beyond the interface where the jovian magnetic field is strong enough to enforce corotation of the plasma, a current-system is induced that includes a disk-shaped near-equatorial extrusion in which field and plasma interact through Lorentz forces to extract energy from the planet's rotation.

If the rotation of the coolest dwarf stars similarly powers their magnetosphere, this energy is ultimately drawn from the energy of rotation. In the case of the Jupiter, Io and Ganymede provide plasma conveniently high in the magnetosphere, outside the distance of geosynchronous rotation but within the Alfvén radius. In the case of the ultra-cool dwarf stars, it is of course possible that one or more close-in planets act as a similar plasma source, but rather than postulating such planets, I hypothesize that plasma is provided by a tenuous hot stellar corona formed either by residual solar-like activity (perhaps associated with the overturning field of a turbulent dynamo) or magnetospheric activity (somehow formed by the breakdown of corotation). How, quantitatively, this balance changes between L0 and L5 remains to be established.

For stars up to late-M, the power extracted from the stellar rotation lies below the characteristic Hα and X-ray emissions. The estimated rate Wrot at which rotational energy is lost from an L2-type dwarf, in contrast, is larger than the characteristic outer-atmospheric losses based on the coronal X-ray luminosity. In the scenario of the rotationally-dominated magnetosphere, [\citeauthor=eviatar+siscoe1980] ([\citeyear=eviatar+siscoe1980]) argued that at most half of the total power taken from Jupiter's rotational energy would be available for radiative emissions, including the aurorae. The rough estimate of the radiative losses of L-type dwarfs (as reflected by LX) is not inconsistent with that argument, but further observations are needed to test this in more detail.

The quiescent radio emission from F-M type stars appears to be predominantly gyrosynchrotron emission from high-energy coronal electrons (see, e.g., the review by [\citeauthor=guedel2002], [\citeyear=guedel2002]). [\citeauthor=hallinan+etal2008] ([\citeyear=hallinan+etal2008]) argued that the radio signal of several very cool dwarf stars (M8.5, M9, and L3.5) is associated with the electron cyclotron maser (ECM) process; they base that argument on the observation that the radio signal is periodically fully circularly polarized, whereas there is also an unpolarized component which they attribute to depolarized ECM emission because its brightness temperature is incompatible with incoherent synchrotron radiation. They pointed out that the ECM mechanism is thought to be responsible for kHz-MHz emission from Jupiter (cf., the review by [\citeauthor=zarka1998], [\citeyear=zarka1998]). Thus, both the enhanced radio to X-ray ratio and the radio polarization signature support the analogy of the magnetospheric processes around Jupiter and around ultracool radidly-rotating dwarf stars.

The plasma transport in the magnetosphere of Jupiter, is thought to occur by convective cells triggered by the centrifugal interchange instability, in which cool, dense volumes change places with hotter, less dense volumes (e.g., [\citeauthor=hill+etal2005], [\citeyear=hill+etal2005], [\citeauthor=chen+hill2008], [\citeyear=chen+hill2008]). In the case of ultracool dwarf stars, the stellar equivalent of this process into the stellar magnetotail shaped by the ISM wind could be the process by which angular momentum is removed from the star.

In view of the arguments discussed in this paper, it appears warranted to consider the possibility of a very similar system of currents in the case of main-sequence stars cooler than about L0 as in the jovian magnetosphere. Perhaps much, if not most, of the Hα emission and the relatively weak coronal X-ray in stars cooler than L0 is associated with activity (including aurorae) driven by the breakdown of corotation like they occur on a smaller scale for Jupiter, while the stellar radio emission may be a signature of high-energy particles accelerated in that process. A dimensional analysis, developed by Fan et al. (1982), applied to the case of L-type stars supports this hypothesis quantitatively.
