Collective attacks and unconditional security in continuous variable quantum key distribution

Over the past few years, quantum continuous variables (CV) have been explored as an alternative to qubits for quantum key distribution (QKD) [\cite=hillery] [\cite=gottesman] [\cite=CLVA]. More specifically, protocols using coherent states and homodyne [\cite=GG] [\cite=GG-Proc] [\cite=silberhorn] or heterodyne [\cite=hetero] measurements have been proposed and experimentally demonstrated [\cite=nature] [\cite=lorenz]. Relying on technologies allowing much higher rates than allowed by the single photon detectors used in qubit based QKD, those protocols are the only ones which could allow key rates in the GHz range in the foreseeable future.

However, the security proofs of these new protocols are not yet as strong as the ones of the qubits-based protocols: they are almost all limited to individual or finite-size [\cite=GC] attacks. To our knowledge, the only unconditional security proofs of CV QKD protocols are [\cite=gottesman] [\cite=barcelona] [\cite=IVAC], only the latter studying coherent-states based protocols. These proofs all rely on specific suboptimal key extraction procedures, and, for each case, it's difficult to separate the effects of the technical inefficiencies of the encoding scheme from the more fundamental effect of real attacks possibility of Eve -- the eavesdropper.

In this letter, we study the effects of a Gaussian collective attack on the key rate of CV QKD protocols based on the Gaussian modulation of coherent-states [\cite=GG] [\cite=GG-Proc] [\cite=hetero] sent through a lossy channel. In these attacks, Eve uses a Gaussian unitary to interact with each of the transmitted pulse and stores her ancillas into a quantum memory. She performs then a collective measurement on her ancillas after Alice and Bob -- the partners performing QKD -- have used the public classical channel to fulfill the protocol.

After introducing the notations used in this letter, we recall the values of various information theoretic quantities for Gaussian states. Then, we compute the secret key rate which can be achieved using direct reconciliation when Bob is allowed to do collective, heterodyne or homodyne measurements. Those results are then extended to reverse reconciliation protocols and compared with the unconditionally secure rates obtained from the generic security proof of Christiandl et al. [\cite=generic].

While completing this work, we learned Navascu�s and Ac�n used very similar techniques to study the security bounds of these protocols [\cite=NA].

Notations.

In all the QKD protocols discussed in this letter, Alice sends n Gaussian modulated coherent states through a lossy channel of transmission T.

Bob then makes measurements on the pulses he receives. It can be an optimal collective measurement or, more realistically, a series of heterodyne [\cite=hetero] or homodyne [\cite=GG] [\cite=GG-Proc] [\cite=nature] measurements. Alice and Bob then agree on a secret key through a (direct or reverse) reconciliation procedure. We are interested in the asymptotic key rates obtained at the limit n  →    ∞  .

In the following, [formula] refers to the quantum state of the light pulse prepared by Alice, [formula] and [formula] to the one received by Bob and Eve. [formula] refers to the (classical) value of Alice's modulation and [formula] to the one of Bob's measurement. For instance [formula] will denote the Von Neumann entropy of the density matrix [formula] at Bob's side, while [formula] will denote the Shannon differential entropy of Bob's measurements.

Alice modulates the two quadratures [formula] and [formula] of the coherent states she sends with random values following Gaussian distribution. To simplify the analysis, we will assume this modulation to be symmetric in [formula] and [formula].

If Bob performs a heterodyne measurement, he gets the two noisy measurements [formula] and [formula], where [formula] and [formula] are two independent Gaussian random variables of variance 1. (The units used in this letter correspond to a unity variance of the vacuum.) If he performs a homodyne measurement, he perfectly measures one quadrature -- let say [formula] -- and obtains no information on the other -- P. One has therefore [formula] and [formula] (or, of course, the symmetric case, where [formula] and [formula]).

The lossy channel is modeled by a beamsplitter of transmitivity T and reflectivity 1 - T, the reflected beam being given to Eve. In the equivalent entanglement-based scheme [\cite=virtual], this attack gives Eve the purification of the mixed state [formula] shared by Alice and Bob. Eve then performs a collective measurement on her part of the purification, after Alice and Bob's classical communication has occurred. As shown below, this attack is more powerful than the ones studied in [\cite=GG] [\cite=GG-Proc] [\cite=nature] [\cite=GC] [\cite=hetero]. However, this attack model is not generic in two aspects.

First, the channel model itself is not generic, since we restrict ourselves to the lossy channel and omit to consider nonzero added-noise and non-Gaussian attacks. This restriction is only due to brevity consideration and will be lifted in a longer article [\cite=long], which will also contain a study of squeezed states protocols. Of course, in an experiment, the amount of added noise has to be measured by Alice and Bob through some sampling and will never be exactly zero. They would thus have to use the more general results of [\cite=long].

A more fundamental restriction comes from the fact that we suppose Alice and Bob share a state of the form [formula]. In other words, we restrict Eve to individual attacks on the channel, even if she is allowed to make collective measurements on the ancillas obtained through these attacks. This restriction will be lifted at the end of this letter, where we apply the generic security proof [\cite=generic] which does not rely on any assumption about Eve's attack.

Entropies and mutual information.

Let [formula] ([formula]) be the variance in the [formula]-quadrature (in the P-quadrature) of the Gaussian state [formula]. Since squeezing is a reversible operation, it doesn't alter the Von Neumann entropy of [formula], which is an increasing function of [formula] [\cite=entth]:

[formula]

The logarithms in the above expression should be taken in base 2 if one wants the result in bits, or in base [formula] if one wants it in nats. For strong modulation ([formula]), one will use the Taylor expansion

Let [formula] and [formula] be the variances of Bob's two orthogonal quadrature measurements. The Shannon differential entropy [formula] is simply the logarithm of [formula], up to an arbitrary additive constant [\cite=Shannon], which can be set to 0:

[formula]

The rate of common information Alice and Bob can extract from their classical values is given by the mutual information [\cite=Shannon] If Bob uses a heterodyne detection, which adds a unit of noise, [formula]. Since a coherent state sent through a lossy channel stays a coherent state, the conditional variance are [formula] and [formula]. One has therefore

[formula]

If Bob is allowed to make arbitrary measurements on the pulses, the information they share is then given by the Holevo information [\cite=H] [\cite=SW] which is attained by collective measurements. Since Bob receives pure (coherent) states, [formula] and

[formula]

If [formula], one has

[formula]

Therefore, by using heterodyne detection instead of the optimal collective measurement, Bob loses an amount of information up to [formula] (i.e.  1 nat ≃ 1.44 bits) per pulse.

Direct key distribution.

To attain the rate [formula], Alice and Bob can use random codes of size [formula], where the basis of the logarithms and the exponential are the same. Devetak and Winter have recently shown [\cite=DW] that Alice can divide this code into privacy amplification subsets of size close to [formula]. This allows Alice and Bob to generate a secret key through a direct reconciliation procedure using only forward communication. This key can be generated at a rate asymptotically close to

[formula]

If Bob makes the optimal collective measurement, substituting [formula] in the above expression and using equation [\eqref=eq:IXB] (with [formula] and [formula]) gives us the attainable direct reconciliation key rate. At the high modulation limit, where [formula], one has [\cite=noteapprox] This limit is the same as the one found assuming Bob and Eve are restricted to heterodyne measurements [\cite=hetero] (individual attacks).

Direct heterodyne key distribution.

The equation [\eqref=eq:dDIXYE] can be applied to the case where Bob uses heterodyne detection [\cite=hetero]. We have then a lossy channel of transmission T between Alice and Bob and another lossy channel of transmission 1 - T between Alice and Eve. We can therefore use the equations [\eqref=eq:IXYhet] and [\eqref=eq:IXB] to expand this expression into As shown by equation [\eqref=eq:IXYIXB], Eve can gain up to 1 nat per pulse by using collective measurement. The best situation for Alice and Bob is the high modulation limit [formula], where It is therefore not possible to perform direct heterodyne QKD if the channel transmission is smaller than [formula]. These maximal losses of 1.4 dB imply a shorter range for this protocol than the 3 dB deduced if one only considers individual attacks or if Bob uses optimal collective measurements.

Direct homodyne key distribution.

Surprisingly, the original proposal [\cite=GG] of direct homodyne QKD is more robust. For those protocols, Alice modulates both quadratures [formula] and [formula] with the same variance [formula] and Bob chooses randomly one quadrature to measure (let say Q). After the public disclosure of this quadrature choice, the information on [formula] is useless and can be forgotten by Alice. The state she has sent to Bob is therefore a mixture of coherent states with a given value of [formula] but different values of [formula]. The mixture received by Bob is a Gaussian mixed states with variances [formula] and [formula], therefore [formula]. When [formula], one has [\cite=noteapprox]

[formula]

Thus, collective measurements only give a small amount (of order [formula]) of supplementary information over homodyne detection, the noise in the useless quadrature ([formula]) plays a crucial role in this.

Eve receives similar mixed states, and, in the strong modulation regime ([formula]), one has The advantage given to Eve by collective measurements is therefore of order [formula] and can be arbitrarily reduced by Alice's use of a strong enough modulation. Therefore, unlike the heterodyne protocol, the key rate of the direct homodyne key distribution protocol remains almost unchanged when compared to [\cite=GG], where Eve was restricted to (postponed) homodyne measurements. More specifically the range limit of this protocol stays at 3 dB (50 %) of losses, whether one considers collective measurements or not.

Reverse key generation.

For symmetry reasons, backward communication is needed distribute a quantum key beyond this 3 dB limit. Either postselection [\cite=silberhorn] [\cite=barcelona] or a reverse reconciliation procedure [\cite=GG-Proc] [\cite=hetero] [\cite=nature] can be used for this purpose. In the latter case, the attainable rate is given by [\cite=DW]

If Bob performs an optimal collective measurement, one has to replace the above expression by [formula], where [formula] is the quantum mutual information Since the joint state [formula] is obtained by the (reversible) mixture of [formula] and a vacuum state in the mode [formula], one has [formula]. At the high modulation limit ([formula]), one has therefore [\cite=noteapprox] which is, like in the direct case, very close to the result obtained with heterodyne detection in an individual attacks scenario [\cite=hetero]. For strong losses ([formula]), this expression becomes

Reverse heterodyne key generation.

In the heterodyne case [\cite=hetero], which is symmetric in [formula] and [formula], one has When [formula], this expression becomes If one also has [formula], [\cite=noteapprox] As in the direct case, Eve gains a finite amount of information by using collective measurement instead of heterodyne measurements. However this gain is not sufficient to reduce the range of the protocol, which still works for arbitrary long ranges. For strong losses ([formula]), the rate is twice smaller than the collective measurement rate

Reverse homodyne key generation

In the homodyne case [\cite=GG-Proc], similar calculations give us: In the large modulation limit ([formula]) [\cite=noteapprox], As for the direct case, the use of homodyne detection by Alice and Bob allows them to reduce the advantage given to Eve by coherent measurement to an arbitrarily small amount and to attain a secret key rate arbitrarily close to the one given in [\cite=GG-Proc], where only individual attacks were considered. In the strong losses regime ([formula]), the rate obtained is almost equal to the one obtained in heterodyne measurements: The (almost) factor 2 advantage in rate given by heterodyne measurement at low losses cancels for strong losses. The use of the homodyne setup is also attractive in experimental QKD because of the sensitivity of the current continuous variable reconciliation algorithms [\cite=slice] [\cite=NVAC] to the signal-to-noise ratio.

Unconditional security

One can also compare these rates to the unconditionaly secure rates S obtained from the generic security proof of Christiandl et al.  [\cite=generic]

[formula]

which is independent of the reconciliation direction. Since Alice sends coherent states, as shown above [formula] and this unconditional secure rate is equal to the direct reconciliation rate [formula] ([formula]) when Bob makes collective (heterodyne) measurements, regardless of the actual reconciliation direction (direct or reverse). The role of the unmeasured (P-)quadrature modulation makes the homodyne case different. If it decreased the efficiency of the collective attacks considered above, it increases the entropy [formula], decreasing the secure rate S given by equation [\eqref=eq:generic]. However, giving the information about this modulation to Eve could only decrease the secret rate. [formula] is then given by [\eqref=eq:HBXhom] and, in the strong modulation regime ([formula]), [\eqref=eq:generic] becomes [\cite=noteapprox] Unconditionally secure homodyne QKD is therefore possible if the channel transmission T is greater than [formula] (1.9 dB)

Conclusion

We have quantified the effect of collective attacks on coherent states based CV QKD protocols through a lossy channel. These attacks are strictly more powerful than the individual attacks studied before. However, if Bob makes homodyne measurements, the advantage given to Eve by these attacks can be made arbitrarily small if Alice uses a strong modulation. On the contrary, if Bob uses heterodyne measurement, these attacks give a finite advantage to Eve. For comparison, we have computed the key rate in the (theoretical) optimal case, where Bob performs a collective measurement.

We also have applied the generic security proof of Christiandl et al. [\cite=generic] to compute an unconditional secure rate for these protocols. This rate is usually lower than the one obtained above, but, this bound being known not to be tight, this does not rule out the possibility for the considered collective attacks to be optimal.
