Observations of the Local Group Dwarf WLM

Introduction

The WLM dwarf irregular galaxy (DDO 221, UGCA 444) is a member of the Local Group. Its basic properties are listed in Table [\ref=basic]. Since its discovery [\citep=wol10] [\citep=mel26], there have been numerous studies of its photometric properties, stellar populations, star formation history, and chemical abundances [\citep=van00]. Unfortunately, other than observations of regions [\citep=hod95], an unsuccessful search for CO [\citep=tay01], and studies of its most basic infrared [\citep=mel94] and radio (Huchtmeier, Seiradakis & Materne 1981; Huchtmeier & Richter 1986) properties, little has been done to study its interstellar medium.

Understanding the neutral hydrogen content in WLM is particularly important for a number of reasons. The first is that at a distance of 0.95 ±   0.04 Mpc [\citep=dol00], a detailed study of the stellar populations of WLM is within reach. This allows us to directly observe the interplay between the stars and the interstellar medium (ISM). From a phenomenological point of view, it only makes sense that we have as detailed an understanding as is possible of the most nearby galaxies to support assumptions about galaxies whose properties are not as easily resolvable. Also, WLM is one of only a handful of irregular galaxies which are close enough for detailed analyses and which are also relatively isolated in space. This provides us with an excellent opportunity to examine the evolution of a galaxy without evidence of recent interaction with its neighbors.

One unique aspect of WLM is a discrepancy between region and population II stellar abundances. A recent study by [\citet=ven03] found the oxygen abundance of a WLM supergiant to be much higher than the nebular abundance of the sampled regions. This is puzzling since the young stars form from the galaxy's ISM and thus should not have a higher metallicity than the gas. Though a larger stellar sample size is clearly needed to determine if the abundance offset is real, a possible explanation is that high metallicity stars became associated with, but did not form from, the low metallicity gas through a merger. If, in fact, a recent merger did occur, it may be observable through observations.

By studying the ISM, and particularly the neutral hydrogen, of dwarf galaxies we can extract information about recent star formation events, mergers, and the galaxy's ability to form stars in the future. Additionally, we can derive a rotation curve for the galaxy and determine its dynamical mass. As WLM is close enough to resolve into stars we can compare the derived mass-to-light ratio to what is expected from its stellar population. Since observations are the most direct method of observing the large scale motions of a galaxy's ISM, continued progress with the study of dark matter relies on high spatial and spectral resolution observations to study the kinematics of the ISM in these galaxies.

In this paper we present the highest spectral and spatial resolution study of the in WLM to date. Section [\ref=observations] describes the ATCA mosaic observations and reduction of the data. In §[\ref=flux] we analyze the total flux and compare its distribution to that of the optical. The position-velocity diagrams and WLM's derived rotation curve are shown in §[\ref=rotation]. Section [\ref=companions] describes our wide-field search for an halo and for companions to WLM and the possibility of a recent merger with a metal-poor cloud is discussed. The consequences of WLM possibly being a barred galaxy are considered in §[\ref=bar] and we summarize in §[\ref=conclusions].

Observations and Data Reduction

WLM was observed with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) in April and May of 1996. The observational parameters and global data are listed in Table [\ref=observations_table]. A mosaic of seven pointings was done producing a 75[formula] ×   75[formula] field. The data were taken in the 375 and 750D configurations, with antenna six not in use in either, producing a synthesized beam size of 39arcsec  ×   161arcsec  in RA and Dec respectively. The total on-source integration time was 27.25 hours. A bandwidth of 8 MHz divided into 1024 channels centered at -  130 km s- 1 yielded a velocity resolution of 1.65 km s- 1.

Calibration was done using the MIRIAD software package. PKS 1934-638, and PKS 2354-117 were used as the primary and secondary flux, bandpass and amplitude/phase calibrators, respectively. Velocities from -  335 to -  220 and 40 to 70 km s- 1 were chosen as representative of the continuum and UVLIN was used to subtract the continuum emission from the spectral data. Fewer channels were used at lower frequency because contamination from Galactic became a problem at velocities above -  40 km s- 1 as is shown in Figure 1.

Each pointing was cleaned separately using CLEAN and then combined with LINMOS to create the mosaic. This method proved better at removing sidelobes and other artifacts than either MOSMEM or MOSSDI which treat the full mosaic as a single datacube. A second datacube was created by smoothing the original cube with a Gaussian with full width at half maximum (FWHM) of twice the beam width in RA and Dec and a Hanning function with a width between first nulls of four channels in velocity. Any regions not containing flux 3σ above the mean of a plane containing no real emission in the smoothed cube was blanked from the unsmoothed cube. The cube was then visually inspected and any signal not present in three consecutive planes was considered noise and blanked.

Flux and Distribution of WLM

The Global Profile

The global emission profile and channel maps are shown in Figures [\ref=global] and [\ref=channel] respectively. In particular, note the asymmetric profile in Figure [\ref=global]. Often such asymmetries are associated with interactions. We find a total integrated flux of 149 Jy km s- 1. Adopting a distance to WLM of 0.95 Mpc [\citep=dol00] and using Equation 1 of [\citet=rob62] (see also the discussion by [\citet=gio88]), the total mass is given by:

[formula]

where SHI is the source flux in units of Jy km s- 1 and D is the distance in Mpc. We find a total mass of (3.2±  0.3)[formula] M[formula] which is smaller than the single-dish measurements of [\citet=huc81] (5.3[formula] M[formula]) and the recent [\citet=kor04] value (4.7[formula] M[formula]) from the HIPASS, when corrected to the distance value adopted here. It is not surprising that we find a smaller value since missing short spacing information leaves us insensitive to large scale emission, which is obvious since [\citet=huc81] report an extent of 45[formula], which is three times the value we find. Note the asymmetric profile in Figure [\ref=global]. Often such asymmetries are associated with interactions, and this presented additional motivation for a wide-field search for .

The Distribution

Figure [\ref=fire_maps] shows the total intensity map superposed on the stacked U image from the Local Group Survey of [\citet=mas02]. The distribution is relatively smooth at our resolution and we are not resolving the structures left by supernovae and stellar winds that we would expect from a galaxy with a high current star formation rate [\citep=dol00]. emission can be seen to extend much past the optical body which is typical of irregular galaxies; the exponential scale length of the major axis is 9[formula], compared to 3.3[formula] in the optical [\citep=mat98]. Nearly elliptical isointensity contours are observed from the outermost regions of the galaxy to within approximately 2[formula] in RA and 5[formula] in Dec of the center and the position angle of the major axis matches fairly well with that of the optical. In the northern half of the galaxy the emission follows the midplane of the galaxy with a slight concave warp toward the west. The stellar distribution in the north has a similar shape but with a much more pronounced warp, thus the bulk of the emission in the north does not closely follow the stellar light distribution. In the southern half of the galaxy the flux is very well aligned with the stars out to the edge of the optical emission and then shifts slightly eastward.

Within 2[formula] in RA and 5[formula] in Dec of the galaxy center, an offset double peak emerges. The origin of this double peak structure is not obvious. It appears as though there are two separate systems, with peaks that are offset by approximately 1[formula] in RA and 3[formula] in Dec and with the western-most of the two peaks at a radial velocity 20 km s- 1 higher (more negative) than the eastern peak. This is reminiscent of the Sculptor Magellanic dwarf ESO 245-G005 (A143; Côté, Carignan & Freeman 2000) which also has a multi-peaked flux distribution with one of its peaks at an offset radial velocity from the rest of the galaxy. The implications of the double-peaked feature are discussed in §[\ref=companions].

Comparison With Optical Data

Further inspection of the double peak region shows additional new findings. Analysis of isophotes in B and V from [\citet=abl77] shows what could be patchy regions of extinction that subtend much of the southern part of WLM. An analysis of U, B, and V images from the Local Group Survey [\citep=mas02] identifies regions of higher values of both ([formula]) and ([formula]) in the southern part of the galaxy (relative to regions in the north; see Figure [\ref=UB]). These regions are found in fingers that run between regions, from the outer to the inner galaxy. Of the two peaks in emission we observe, the eastern one is roughly aligned with one of these extinction regions, while the western peak lies just north of a large complex of regions. The all-sky Galactic extinction map produced by Schlegel, Finkbeiner, & Davis (1998) shows E() at levels of only 0.02 to 0.03 magnitudes; thus we assume this extinction to be internal to WLM (although the Schlegel et al.  observations do not resolve the galaxy so we can't be sure from their maps that there is no small scale Galactic extinction). Additionally, the regions mapped by [\citet=hod95] all lie either adjacent to or along the line of sight to these extinction regions. A possible explanation of this extinction is the presence of a large molecular gas complex in the southern half of WLM. The only search for any type of molecular gas was that of [\citet=tay01]. Their CO observations resulted in a non-detection, however they point out that in low metallicity systems like WLM there is evidence for a high CO to H2 conversion factor (Taylor, Kobulnicky, & Skillman 1998). Also, their beam size was small enough that they were only able to observe a relatively small fraction of the galaxy, with those observations focusing on parts of the galaxy near the regions observed by [\citet=hod95]. Since CO had been found near regions in other Local Group dwarf irregulars, this was an excellent place to begin their search; however these regions, in large part, do not coincide with the regions we find to have the highest extinction. Thus, it is still possible to have a substantial amount of molecular hydrogen in the galaxy without any CO detected. We also inspected radio continuum maps to search for emission from embedded super-star clusters, which we might expect to observe since WLM is a late type star-forming galaxy, but none were detected.

Position-Velocity Diagrams and the Rotation Curve

Except in the far northern and southern parts of the galaxy, the isovelocity contours of WLM (shown overlaid on the total intensity map in Figure [\ref=velocity]) are relatively parallel, which is consistent with regular solid body rotation. In the far north and south the contours take on the characteristic shape of differential rotation showing where the rotation curve begins to flatten. Overall, the velocity field is fairly symmetric, with some deviations we are unable to resolve along the south-eastern edge of the galaxy. This largely symmetric velocity distribution with slight departures is typical of dwarf irregular galaxies [\citep=ski96]. One noticeable asymmetry is the offset in velocity between the western and eastern sides of the galaxy. Although the major axis of the galaxy has a nearly N-S orientation, the isovelocity contours do not align with constant declination and show a difference of roughly 10 km s- 1 from one side of the galaxy to the other.

In Figure [\ref=pv] we show position-velocity diagrams for slices running from north to south through the east emission peak, the nominal galaxy center, and the west emission peak, respectively. Like the flux distribution, the position-velocity diagrams describe a mostly uniform rotating disk galaxy, with some subtleties. First, the emission from the eastern slice is offset from that of the western slice by approximately 20 km s- 1. Second, the eastern slice shows a bifurcation in velocity near the center of the galaxy. This can also be seen in the central and western slices, but is most prominent in the east. Because of our relatively poor resolution in declination, it is not clear what role beam smearing is playing in our perception of this feature - it could be due to a single cloud at a discrepant velocity or it could really be an extended feature as it appears in Figure [\ref=pv]. This structure may be indicative of a bar in WLM and is discussed further in §[\ref=bar].

It is also possible that a gaseous blowout created by a stellar association is responsible for displacing gas north-east of the galaxy center and creating the multi-component position-velocity diagrams. Holes are relatively common in the disks of dwarf irregular galaxies [\citep=ski96] and sometimes they are directly associated with at discrepant velocities indicative of blow-out (e.g., IC 10 - [\citet=ss89], [\citet=wm98]; NGC 1569 - [\citet=id90], [\citet=si02]; Ho II - [\citet=pwbr92]). For a disk seen edge-on, it may not be possible to see the holes, and the only evidence of blowout would be gas at discrepant velocities (e.g., NGC 625 - [\citet=cmsc04]). However, no Hα is observed in this region and there is no evidence of a young stellar association or cluster. Thus, if a blowout did occur, it would have to be a relatively old feature (i.e., >   10-20 Myr). Additionally, the offset between the velocities seen in the western and eastern parts of the galaxy are continuous over the most of the disk, so a localized blowout event seems an unlikely explanation for the offset. Ultimately, higher resolution and sensitivity observations and deeper optical imaging should be able to determine the nature of the discrepant velocity .

Rotation curves were created by fitting a tilted-ring model [\citep=beg87] to the velocity field shown in Figure [\ref=velocity]. The velocity field was divided into concentric rings, each 162arcsec  in width, and six parameters (systemic velocity, rotational velocity, position angle, inclination, and x and y kinematical center) were iteratively fitted to best model the observed radial velocity. Rotation curves were created using only the approaching half of the galaxy, only the receding half of the galaxy, and the entire galaxy. The systemic velocity and galaxy center were determined first, beginning with values from the global profile and optical data, respectively, then fixed for all rings. The inclination was fit to the optical value of 69[formula] because it was not well-constrained by the data. The position angle was allowed to vary, yet on both sides of the galaxy it only changed by approximately 4.

For the final rotation curve the position angle was fixed at 181, which was the average value when allowed to vary, leaving the rotational velocity the only parameter free to vary. Errors were determined by adopting the larger of either the formal errors from the fits or the difference between the velocity with the position angle fixed and the velocity with the position angle free. A significant limitation to our rotation curve analysis was that our beam was elongated in the same direction as the galaxy, leaving us few data points for the final rotation curves. Because of this, we will not attempt a detailed mass-modeling of the galaxy, instead leaving that task for higher-resolution studies.

The morphology of the rotation curves are typical of a disk system, showing solid-body rotation in the inner galaxy and differential rotation in the outer. For the total dynamical mass determination we will adopt the last measured data point (38 ±   5.0 km s- 1 at 0.89 kpc) from the rotation curve using the entire galaxy. This maximum velocity is typical of galaxies with similar absolute B magnitudes [\citep=cot00]. Assuming a spherically symmetric dark matter distribution, this yields a total dynamical mass of (3.00±  0.80)×  108 M[formula]. The (M/LB)dyn value at the last measured point is 5.9, which is also typical of dwarf irregular galaxies at this radius. It should again be noted however, that due to our lack of sensitivity to large-scale structures, we are missing a significant amount of at large radii and thus are certainly not measuring the entire dynamical mass of the galaxy.

Wide-Field Search for

After [\citet=min96] suggested the existence of an extended stellar halo in WLM, mosaic imaging was proposed to search for an associated halo. This search took on greater importance after a recent study by [\citet=ven03] found a supergiant with an oxygen abundance 0.68 dex (>  3σ) higher than the nebular abundance from sampled regions [\citep=hod95]. This is a serious problem since stars form out of, and thus should not have higher abundances than the nearby ISM, so the possibility existed that this could be the signature of a recent merger with a low-metallicity cloud. It is interesting to note that in ESO 245-G005, which has a multi-component flux distribution and velocity field, like WLM, was found by [\citet=mil96] to have a strong abundance gradient along its bar which is not typical of this type of galaxy. [\citet=cot00] postulate that this could be due to the accretion of an cloud of different metallicity or that the entire galaxy is the result of a recent merger that has not yet been able to completely mix its metals. Their argument is strengthened by the observations of [\citet=mil96], [\citet=tay95], and others who have found that a large fraction of irregular and galaxies have companions. Additionally, WLM's global profile shows strong asymmetry, which is often associated with interactions in spiral galaxies.

[\citet=ven03] were skeptical that the accretion of an cloud could be responsible for the abundance anomaly because within the last 10 Myr (the lifetime of a supergiant) a > 106 M[formula] cloud would had to have been accreted to dilute the ISM sufficiently to produce the observed abundances. Because the overall distribution is smooth and the rotation curves for the approaching and receding portions of the galaxy are nearly identical, with no tidal structures observed, we see no compelling kinematic evidence of a recent interaction or merger. Additionally, we created a cube with three times lower resolution than the full resolution cube to search for extended low surface brightness features like we might expect from a low-mass companion. A plane by plane search revealed no such companions to a three sigma mass limit of 8.4[formula] M[formula] (assuming a velocity width of 15 km s- 1), although because WLM is a bright source resolved by our beam we were unable to completely remove the first sidelobe, who's peak lies approximately 7.5[formula] east and west of the galaxy center. This leaves us less sensitive to any companions which may exist in this region. Finally, [\citet=min96] postulated the existence of a stellar halo from deep [formula]V and [formula]I photometry. Their data showed the red stars to be less centrally distributed than the blue stars and attributed the difference in stellar population between the inner and outer part to a flattened population II halo extending to 2 kpc from the galaxy center. More recently however, [\citet=bat04] performed a survey of C stars in WLM and found no evidence to support the [\citet=min96] conclusion. In this investigation we see no evidence of any extended emission which would be consistent with a gaseous halo.

Is WLM a Barred Galaxy?

Perhaps a better explanation for the somewhat peculiar flux distribution and irregular structure in the position-velocity diagrams is the presence of a bar. Simulations of gas dynamics in barred spiral galaxies [\citep=rob79] have shown that a bar and its associated shocks are capable of depleting gas from the inner parts of the galaxy and piling it up near where the end of the bar meets the spiral arms. This is born out in observations of many barred galaxies with giant regions found at the ends of their bars. This is particularly true of Magellanic irregulars. [\citet=elm80] found that 30-50% of barred irregular galaxies in their sample had large peripheral regions and that these regions are usually near one end of the bar. Interestingly, WLM's largest region appears near the southwest edge of the stellar distribution. However, whether this region is actually at the periphery of the galaxy and furthermore whether or not WLM is a barred system may be impossible to determine because of its high inclination angle (69). However, if a bar does exist, it might be capable of displacing enough gas to produce a multi-peaked flux distribution as well as inducing non-circular motions in the gas to create the observed peculiarities in the position-velocity diagrams. This hypothesis does not explain the abundance anomaly, but again, more spectroscopic observations are needed to resolve this question.

Results and Conclusions

We have presented ATCA neutral hydrogen mosaic imaging of the dwarf irregular galaxy WLM. We find a total flux of 149 Jy km s- 1 and, adopting a distance of 0.95 ±   0.04 Mpc, a total mass of (3.2 ±   0.3)×  107 M[formula]. This mass is significantly lower than the single dish measurement of [\citet=huc81] which is expected since we are insensitive to large scale emission due to short spacing information.

At our resolution the distribution is smooth and extends past the optical distribution by a factor of approximately three which is typical of this type of galaxy. In the northern half of the galaxy the exhibits a slight warp toward the west though it is not as pronounced as that of the stars, so the bulk of the does not closely trace the stellar light distribution. In the southern half of the galaxy the is aligned with the stars out to the edge of the optical emission then shifts somewhat eastward. In the center of WLM we detect a double peaked core not previously resolved. The peaks are separated by approximately 1[formula] in RA and 3[formula] in Dec with the northern peak at a radial velocity 20 km s- 1 higher than the southern and while the northern peak is smooth in position-velocity space the southern peak is confined to between -  110 and -  130 km s- 1. The stellar halo proposed by [\citet=min96] led us to conduct a wide field search, 38[formula] in radius, for an associated gaseous halo, but we observe the to fall smoothly into the background and thus see no evidence for such a halo in .

Inspection of the central core of WLM from a previous optical study [\citep=abl77] as well as our own analysis of recently released data [\citep=mas02] show what appear to be regions of significant extinction in the southern half of the galaxy. Because the Galactic extinction maps of [\citet=sch98] show very little extinction along this line of sight and because we find variable extinction values within the galaxy, we conclude that the extinction is internal to WLM and produced by a complex of molecular clouds which are outlined by previously mapped regions [\citep=hod95].

The isovelocity contours of WLM are nearly parallel over most of the galaxy which is consistent with solid body rotation. In the far north and south the contours take on the characteristic shape of differential rotation showing where the rotation curve flattens. The velocity field is mostly symmetric, with some deviation along the south-eastern edge of the galaxy, which we are unable to resolve.

We do know that WLM has a double peaked flux distribution. We also see some irregularity in the position-velocity diagrams which, when combined with the abundance anomaly of [\citet=ven03] present an interesting puzzle since we see no kinematic evidence of a recent merger. One possible explanation for these observations is that WLM is a barred galaxy. Bars in dwarf irregulars have been observed to deplete gas from the inner parts of the galaxy and deposit it near the end of the bar. Typically giant regions are found near where the bar meets the spiral arm. This would explain both the unusual flux distribution and velocity structures, however WLM's high inclination may make this determination impossible. Only higher resolution studies of WLM will be able to shed light on what the true cause of the multi-peaked core is, and if WLM does have a multi-component velocity field.
