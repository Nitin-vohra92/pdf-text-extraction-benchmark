Lévy process and its Jacobi field

The notion of a Jacobi field in the Fock space first appeared in the works by Berezansky and Koshmanenko [\cite=BerKosh1] [\cite=BerKosh2], devoted to the axiomatic quantum field theory, and then was further developed by Brüning (see e.g. [\cite=Bru]). These works, however, did not contain any relations with probability measures. A detailed study of a general commutative Jacobi field in the Fock space and a corresponding spectral measure was carried out in a serious of works by Berezansky, see e.g. [\cite=bere] [\cite=berre] and the references therein.

In [\cite=BLM] (see also [\cite=L] [\cite=Lproc]), the Jacobi field of a Lévy process on a general manifold X was studied. Let us shortly recall these results.

Let X be a complete, connected, oriented C∞ (non-compact) Riemannian manifold and let B(X) be the Borel σ-algebra on X. Let σ be a Radon measure on (X,B(X)) that is non-atomic and non-degenerate (i.e., σ(O) > 0 for any open set O  ⊂  X). As a typical example of measure σ, one can take the volume measure on X.

We denote by D the space C∞0(X) of all infinitely differentiable, real-valued functions on X with compact support. It is known that D can be endowed with a topology of a nuclear space. Thus, we can consider the standard nuclear triple

[formula]

where D' is the dual space of D with respect to the zero space L2(X,σ). (Here and below, all the linear spaces we deal with are real.) The dual pairing between ω∈D' and φ∈D will be denoted by 〈ω,φ〉. We denote the cylinder σ-algebra on D' by C(D').

Let ν be a measure on [formula] whose support contains an infinite number of points and assume ν({0}) = 0. Let

[formula]

We further assume that [formula] is a finite measure on [formula], and moreover, there exists an ε > 0 such that

[formula]

We now define a centered Lévy process on X (without Gaussian part) as a generalized process on D' whose law is the probability measure μ on (D',C(D')) given by its Fourier transform

[formula]

Thus, ν is the Lévy measure of the Lévy process μ. Without loss of generality, we can suppose that [formula] is a probability measure on [formula]. (Indeed, if this is not the case, define ν': = c- 1ν and σ': = cσ, where [formula].)

It follows from [\eqref=4335ew4] that the measure [formula] has all moments finite, and furthermore, the set of all polynomials is dense in [formula]. Therefore, by virtue of [\cite=b], there exists a unique (infinite) Jacobi matrix

[formula]

whose spectral measure is [formula].

Next, we denote by P(D') the set of continuous polynomials on D', i.e., functions on D' of the form [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula]. Here, [formula] stands for symmetric tensor product. The greatest number i for which [formula] is called the power of a polynomial. We denote by Pn(D') the set of continuous polynomials of power ≤  n.

By [\eqref=4335ew4], [\eqref=rew4w], and [\cite=Sko], P(D') is a dense subset of L2(D',μ). Let P~n(D') denote the closure of Pn(D') in L2(D',μ), let [formula], [formula], denote the orthogonal difference [formula], and let [formula]. Then, we evidently have:

[formula]

The set of all projections [formula] of continuous monomials [formula], fn∈Dn, onto [formula] is dense in [formula]. For each [formula], we define a Hilbert space [formula] as the closure of the set Dn in the norm generated by the scalar product

[formula]

Denote

[formula]

where [formula]. By [\eqref=zgzguzug]-[\eqref=qztztzt], we get the unitary operator

[formula]

that is defined through [formula], fn∈Dn, [formula], and then extended by linearity and continuity to the whole space [formula] .

An explicit formula for the scalar product [formula] looks as follows. We denote by [formula] the set of all sequences α of the form

[formula]

Let [formula]. For each [formula], [formula], [formula], and for any function [formula] we define a function [formula] by setting

[formula]

We have (cf. [\cite=L]):

For any f(n),g(n)∈Dn , we have :

[formula]

where

[formula]

Next, we find the elements which belong to the space [formula] after the completion of Dn. To this end, we define, for each [formula] , the Hilbert space

[formula]

Define a mapping

[formula]

by setting , for each f(n)∈Dn , the [formula]-coordinate of U(n)f(n) to be Dαf(n). By virtue of Theorem [\ref=oifvoh], U(n) may be extended by continuity to an isometric mapping of [formula] into

[formula]

Furthermore, we have (cf. [\cite=beme1] [\cite=L]):

The mapping

[formula]

is a unitary opertator .

By virtue of Theorem [\ref=ojivfed] and [\eqref=qztztzt], we can identify [formula] with the space

[formula]

and the space [formula] with

[formula]

For a vector [formula], we will denote its α-coordinate by fα .

Note that, for for [formula], we have

[formula]

Hence, the space [formula] contains the symmetric Fock space

[formula]

as a proper subspace. Therefore, we call [formula] an extended Fock space. We also note that the space [formula] satisfies the axioms of an interacting Fock space, see [\cite=HW].

In the space L2(D',μ), we consider, for each φ∈D, the operator M(φ) of multiplication by the function 〈  ·  ,φ〉. Let J(φ): = UM(φ)U- 1. Denote by [formula] the set of all vectors of the form [formula], fi∈Di, [formula], [formula]. Evidently, [formula] is a dense subset of [formula]. We have the following theorem, see [\cite=BLM].

For any φ∈D , we have :

[formula]

Here, J+(φ) is the usual creation operator :

[formula]

Next, for each f(n)∈Dn, [formula] and J-(ξ)f(n) = 0 if n = 0 , [formula] if [formula] and In formulas [\eqref=gfg] and [\eqref=ggztr], we denoted by Sα the orthogonal projection of [formula] onto [formula] ,

[formula]

Finally , each operator J(φ) , φ∈D , is essentially self-adjoint on [formula] .

By [\eqref=7t667], the operator [formula] is a sum of creation, neutral, and annihilation operators, and hence [formula] has a Jacobi operator's structure. The family of operators (J(φ))φ∈D is called the Jacobi field corresponding to the Lévy process μ.

An equivalent representation

As shown in [\cite=berepascal] [\cite=KL] [\cite=Ly3] [\cite=L], in some cases, the formulas describing the operators J0(φ) and J-(φ) can be significantly simplified. However, in the case of a general Lévy process this is not possible, see [\cite=BLM]. We will now present a unitarily equivalent description of the Jacobi field (J(φ))φ∈D, which will have a simpler form.

Let us consider the Hilbert space [formula] spanned by the orthonormal basis (en)∞n = 0 with

[formula]

Consider the tensor product [formula], and let

[formula]

be the (usual) symmetric Fock space over [formula].

Denote by [formula] the dense subset of [formula] consisting of all finite vectors, i.e.,

[formula]

The Jacobi matrix J determines a linear symmetric operator in [formula] with domain [formula] by the following formula:

[formula]

Denote by J+,J0,J- the corresponding creation, neutral, and annihilation operators in [formula], so that J = J+ + J0 + J-.

Denote by Φ the linear subspace of [formula] that is the linear span of the vacuum vector [formula] and vectors of the form [formula], where [formula], φ∈D, and [formula]. The set Φ is evidently a dense subset of [formula].

Now, for each φ,ψ∈D and [formula], we set

[formula]

and then extend these operators by linearity to the whole Φ. Thus,

[formula]

where a+(  ·  ), a0(  ·  ), a-(  ·  ) are the usual creation, neutral, and annihilation operators in [formula]. (In fact, under, e.g., [formula] we understand the differential second quantization of the operator [formula] in [formula], which, in turn, is the tensor product of the operator J+ in [formula] defined on [formula] and the operator of multiplication by φ in L2(X,σ) defined on D.) Note also that

[formula]

In the following theorem, for a linear operator A in a Hilbert space H, we denote by [formula] its closure (if it esxists).

There exists a unitary operator

[formula]

for which the following assertions hold . Let J+(φ) , J0(φ) , and J-(φ) , φ∈D , be linear operators in [formula] with domain [formula] as in Theorem 3. Then , for all φ∈D ,

[formula]

and

[formula]

The proof of Theorem 4 is a straightforward generalization of the proof of Theorem 1 in [\cite=LSWN], so we only outline it.

First, we recall the classical unitary isomorphism between the usual Fock space over [formula] and L2(D',μ):

[formula]

This isomorphism was proved by Itô [\cite=Ito] and extended in [\cite=L] to a general Lévy process on X. Note also that

[formula]

Next, we have the unitary operator

[formula]

defined by

[formula]

Let

[formula]

be the Fourier transform in generalized joint eigenvectors of the Jacobi matrix J, see [\cite=b]. The U3 can be characterized as a unique unitary operator which maps the vector [formula] into the function identically equal to 1, and which maps the closure [formula] of the symmetric operator J in [formula] into the multiplication operator by the variable s.

Let

[formula]

be given by

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the identity operator. Using U4, we naturally construct the unitary operator

[formula]

We now define a unitary operator

[formula]

Then, the assertions of Theorem 4 about the unitary operator I follow from Theorem 3, the construction of the unitary operator I (see in particular Theorem 3.1 in [\cite=L]), [\eqref=trd], and a limiting procedure.
