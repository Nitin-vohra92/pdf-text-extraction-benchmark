Large Nc QCD and Models of Exotic Baryons

2003 saw the first report of a narrow resonant baryon state with strangeness +1 and a mass of approximately 1.54 GeV[\cite=exp]; this state has been denoted the θ+. This claim stimulated an extraordinarily high level of both experimental and theoretical research. The reason for this intense interest stems largely from the fact that such a state is manifestly exotic: it cannot be made as a three quark state. The minimum number of quarks to construct a state with these quantum numbers is 5 (four quarks and one anti-quark) and accordingly such states are often referred to as pentaquarks. I will not review the experimental situation here except to note that it is quite confused: numerous experiments appear to confirm the existence of a narrow exotic state at a similar mass while many others see no indication of it. While it is extremely important that this experimental situation be sorted out--as will presumably happen in the next couple of years--the issues of relevance here do not strongly depend on how things are ultimately resolved experimentally. Instead, this talk focuses on the theory side and, in particular, on how large Nc QCD can help understand the situation. The work discussed here summarizes work in refs. [\cite=Coh1] [\cite=Coh2] and for a more complete discussion the reader is referred to the original work.

Most theories concerning pentaquarks is based on modeling QCD rather than QCD itself. Of course, the number of models is quite large and I will not attempt to review the full spectrum of models. Instead, I will focus on one class of models--the chiral soliton models--since they have a rather special status. In the first place, a chiral soliton model[\cite=DPP] was used to predict a narrow pentaquark state with virtually the same mass as was ultimately reported experimentally. In contrast, most other models were postdictions with parameters fit with a knowledge of the mass. Clearly, true predictions carry much greater weight: as has been said,"Predictions are difficult--especially about the future". (It is interesting to note that an internet search to find the origin of this quote led to a site attributing it to Yogi Berra--the former New York Yankee catcher--and another site attributing it to Neils Bohr--the Danish physicist.) Perhaps more importantly, the prediction was quite insensitive to the details of the model; the functional form of the soliton profile function played no role. All that mattered dynamically was the structure of the model, the values of SU(3) breaking parameters (fixed in the non-exotic sector) and the identification of the nucleon state of the multiplet.

From a theory perspective this model insensitivity is crucial. It has long been known that there are predictions of soliton models for which the details of the soliton model are totally irrelevant (such as the ratio gπNN / gπNΔ [\cite=AN]). All known cases where predictions of soliton models do not depend on the dynamical details are also known to be true in large Nc QCD. This can be demonstrated by the use of large Nc consistency rules[\cite=cons]. This suggests that the predicted θ+ properties might also be model-independent predictions of large Nc QCD. If true, this would be really important: we would then essentially understand the structure of the θ+ modulo SU(3) symmetry breaking effects and higher-order 1/Nc corrections. Unfortunately, however, this simply is not the case. The apparent insensitivity to the model details arises from an inconsistent treatment of the quantization of the soliton models in the sense of large Nc counting.

To understand why this is so, we need to review the standard methods for quantizing solitons. To begin, consider a topological soliton model which has SU(2) flavor symmetry and is based on a nonlinear sigma model. The chiral fields are given in terms of a matrix [formula] where [formula] are the pions. Large Nc QCD justifies solving the theory classically and the lowest energy solution having winding number unity (corresponding to baryon number unity) is a "hedgehog" of the form [formula] with f(0) - f(  ∞  ) = π. Note that such a configuration correlates isospace and ordinary space and thereby breaks both rotational and isospin symmetries. Accordingly such a classical configuration cannot correspond directly to a single physical state. Rather, the hedgehog corresponds to a band on nearly degenerate states--in much the same way as a deformed Hartree-Fock solution in nuclear physics corresponds to a band of low-lying states.

To obtain physical states one needs a method to project from the hedgehog onto states with physical quantum numbers. Adkins, Nappi and Witten (ANW) introduced a semiclassical method (justified at large Nc) for doing this [\cite=ANW]. One introduces an ansatz for a time-dependent U given by [formula], where A(t) is a time-dependent, space-independent, SU(2) matrix. Inserting this into the lagrangian density of the model and integrating over space gives a collective lagrangian which only depends on A and ∂tA. This can be Legendre transformed into a collective hamiltonian:

[formula]

with the constraint |a0|2 + |a1|2 + |a2|2 + |a2|2 = 1. The key to what follows is the Nc scaling: M0  ~  Nc and I  ~  Nc. This corresponds to a slowly rotating hedgehog at large Nc and its motion can be separately quantized:

[formula]

Note all states have I = J and one can consistently quantize the system to have I=J being half integers. The lowest two states have I=J=1/2 (nucleon) and I = J = 3 / 2 (Δ) and thus MΔ  -  MN  =  3 / I  ~  1 / Nc. The collective wave functions are just the Wigner D matrices (appropriately normalized).

It should be stressed that this approach is based on an ansatz and as such one must check the self-consistency of the approach. Ultimately it is justified at large Nc since the collective motion is adiabatic: angular velocities go like J / I  ~  N- 1c and are truly collective, covering the full angular space (of order N0c) yielding frequencies (and hence excitation energies of order N- 1c. This, in turn, implies a Born-Oppenheimer separation of the slow collective motion from the faster modes associated with vibrations of the meson fields (with time scales of order N0c and hence energies of order N0c). Because of this scale separation the collective modes can be quantized separately from the intrinsic vibrations.

Now let us turn to the problem of relevance to θ+ physics: SU(3) solitons. Shortly after the ANW quantization was introduced it was extended by a number of workers to solitons in models with SU(3) flavor[\cite=SU3Quant]. Extending the models from SU(2) to SU(3) flavor is intellectually straightforward. The only essential new feature is the inclusion of a topological Wess-Zumino-Witten term which builds in the anomalies[\cite=Wit1]. For simplicity, first consider the case of exact SU(3) symmetry. The standard semiclassical approach is then to first solve the problem classically which yields a hedgehog configuration in a two-flavor subspace (which we will take to an intrinsic u-d subspace by convention). Following the ANW ansatz one introduces a time-dependent, space-independent, global SU(3) rotation A(t). At this stage the parallel of the two flavor case is virtually exact. However, the Wess-Zumino-Witten term introduces a constraint: In the body-fixed (co-rotating) frame the hypercharge must be Nc / 3. This constraint plays a critical role in what follows.

Going through this procedure yields a collective rotation hamiltonian of the form:

[formula]

where the prime indicates the generator as measured in a co-rotating frame, and I1 (I2) is the moment of inertia for motion within (out of) the original SU(2) subspace. Note that there is kinetic energy in the intrinsic 8 direction as it leaves the original hedgehog unchanged. The physics associated with this direction is encoded in the constraint. As noted by Witten[\cite=Wit2] this is quite analogous to the problem of a charge particle moving in the field of a magnetic monopole.

This procedure yields masses given by

[formula]

C2 is the quadratic Casimir, and is labeled by p,q which specify the SU(3) representation. The constraint due to the Wess-Zumino-Witten term imposes the restriction that the representation must have a state with Y = Nc / 3 and implies that angular momentum is determined by the condition that 2J + 1 equals the number of states with S=0. Plugging in Nc = 3, one sees the lowest representations are (p,q)=(1,1) (spin 1/2 octet), (p,q)=(3,0) (spin 3/2 decuplet) and (p,q)=(0,3) (spin 1/2 anti-decuplet). This last representation is clearly exotic.

Diakonov, Petrov and Polyakov proposed to take these anti-decuplet states seriously[\cite=DPP]. The predicted value depends on I2 which was fit by identifying the N(1710) as a member of the multiplet and by using SU(3) breaking effects included perturbatively with all parameters determined in the non-exotic sector. The fact the width of the state came out as relatively small was taken as a self-consistent justification for not treating the θ+ as a large Nc artifact.

The question which needs to be addressed is whether the rigid-rotor type semiclassical projection used here is kosher for the exotic states. Since the question ultimately comes down to whether the Born-Oppenheimer separation is justified at large Nc for these states, care should be taken to keep Nc arbitrary and large throughout the analysis. In particular one ought not set Nc = 3 when imposing the constraint of the Witten-Wess-Zumino term, at least when doing formal studies of the Nc dependence. In doing this one sees that the flavor SU(3) representations at large Nc differ from their Nc = 3 counterparts. The lowest-lying representation consistent with the Witten-Wess-Zumino term constraint has [formula] and has J = 1 / 2. Thus, it is a clear analog of the octet representation and will be denoted as the "8" representation. (The quotes are to remind us that it is not in fact an octet representation.) Similarly the next lowest representation, has [formula] and has J = 3 / 2. It is the large Nc analog of the decuplet and will be denoted "10". The salient feature of the anti-decuplet is that its lowest representation contains an exotic S=+1 state. Thus its large Nc analog is the lowest representation containing manifestly exotic states. This representation is [formula] and has J = 1 / 2; it will be denoted "[formula]".

Now let us look at the excitation energy of the exotic states which can be computed from eq. ([\ref=mass]):

[formula]

Noting that I2  ~  Nc, one sees that this implies that the excitation energy of the exotic state is of order N0c. This may be contrasted to the excitation of the non-exotic "10" representation which is of order 1 / Nc.

The fact the standard semiclassical quantization gave excitation energies of order N0c for exotic states means that the approach is not justified for such states. Recall that the analysis was justified self-consistently via a Born-Oppenheimer scale separation. For the non-exotic states this is justified. However, for the exotic states the characteristic time associated with the excitations (one over the energy difference) is order N0c. This is the same characteristic time as the "fast" vibrational excitation of the meson fields. One cannot therefore justify treating the "collective" degrees of freedom separately. Thus the prediction of θ+ properties via this collective quantization procedure cannot be justified from large Nc.

In fact, there are many other ways to see that approach is not justified by large Nc. There is an extensive discussion of these in ref. [\cite=Coh2]. Here we will briefly mention a couple of these. As discussed above, ref. [\cite=DPP] stressed the small numerical value of the width to justify the treatment self-consistently. However, from the perspective of formal large Nc consistency, this numerical value is essentially irrelevant. The key question is how does the width depend parametrically on Nc? If the standard collective quantization procedure outlined above had been justified by large Nc physics, then it should become exact in the large Nc limit in the sense of giving an exact value for the mass. If this is not the case then some kind of ad hoc correction must be added on and there is no a priori reason for it to be small unless it vanishes at large Nc. This in turn means the width must go to zero at large Nc. One way to see this is simply that if the width is non-zero, then an asymptotic state doesn't exist and the concept of an exact mass becomes ill defined. Alternatively one can view the width as originating from an imaginary contribution to the mass. However, the standard collective quantization gives a real value, and had it become exact at large Nc one would have zero widths in this limit.

The upshot of all this is that if the approach is justified, then at a formal level the width must approach zero at large Nc. Of course, for non-exotic states such as the decuplet, this is true. The reason is simply phase space. As Nc grows, the excitation energy for these states drops thereby killing the phase space for decay. In contrast, as shown recently by Praszalowicz[\cite=Pra] the width of the θ+ as calculated via the standard collective approach is order N0c. This demonstrates that the procedure is not self consistent.

Another perspective is given by the spin-flavor contracted SU(6) symmetry which can be derived on general grounds from QCD using large Nc consistency rules [\cite=cons]. It is precisely the existence of such a symmetry that requires predictions independent of details in soliton models to arise as true large Nc model-independent results of QCD. However, for three flavors the results of such an analysis are quite well known. One predicts exactly the states in a large Nc naive quark model--exotic collective states are not obtained in this model-independent approach. Thus, a priori there is no fundamental reason to believe that the quantization procedure discussed above which gives rise to collective exotic states is consistent with QCD. In contrast, the nonexotic states clearly are.

For another perspective on problems with the standard method used to quantize these solitons see Igor Klebanov's talk in this volume and his work with collaborators at Princeton in ref. [\cite=Kleb].

While there appears to be compelling evidence that the approach fails there is an obvious question as to why. Of course, at certain level there is no mystery. The approach is based on an ansatz and the ansatz needs to be shown to be self consistent. While the scales are such that the properties of non-exotic states can be self-consistently described, they are also such that the self-consistency fails for the exotic states. At a deeper level the failure is due to the mixing of intrinsic vibrational modes with the collective rotational modes. For systems without velocity dependent forces such modes are orthogonal and hence cannot mix at leading order. However, as discussed in ref. [\cite=Coh2], velocity-dependent forces spoil this orthogonality and allow mixing. The Witten-Wess-Zumino term gives rise to precisely such velocity-dependent interactions and spoils the orthogonality.

In conclusion, the standard collective quantization method as applied to exotic states such as the θ+ cannot be justified from large Nc QCD. It is logically possible, of course, that such a procedure can be justified for some other reason, but at present no such justification is known. Thus one should view any predictions based on this procedure with real caution.
