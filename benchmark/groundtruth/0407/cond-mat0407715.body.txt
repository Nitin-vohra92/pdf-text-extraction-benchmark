Scale Invariant Fractal and Slow Dynamics in Nucleation and Growth Processes

The kinetics of phase transformation via nucleation and growth of a stable phase (S-phase) represents one of the most fundamental topic of interest in both science and technology [\cite=kn.christian]. It plays a key role in metallurgical applications as well as in many seemingly unrelated fields of research. The kinetics of crystal growth [\cite=kn.crystallization], the domain switching phenomena in ferroelectrics [\cite=kn.ferroelectrics] and the DNA replication in organisms [\cite=kn.replication] are just a few examples to name. Much of our theoretical understanding of such phenomenon is provided by the Kolmogorov-Johnson-Mehl-Avrami (KJMA) model. It has been formulated independently by Kolmogorov, by Johnson and Mehl and by Avrami in and around the 1940s [\cite=kn.kolmogorov]. It still remains one of the most studied theory and is the only means of interpreting the experimental data to gain insight of the process. The basic algorithm of the KJMA theory is trivially simple. One time unit of the process in one dimension can be defined as follows.

Randomly a position is selected for nucleation of point-like seed of S-phase on an interval of M-phase.

Upon nucleation the seed starts growing isotropically on either side with a constant velocity v0 at the expense of the decay of M-phase.

Whenever two such growing phases from opposite sides meet, growth ceases immediately at the point of contact, while continuing elesewhere.

The process is repeated ad infinitum.

In the context of nucleation and growth phenomena, the question we usually ask is: What is the fraction of M-phase that still survives at time t? According to the KJMA theory, such quantity in d dimensions obey the exponential decay known as the Kolmogorov-Avrami law

[formula]

where, Γ decribes the constant nucleation rate per unit volume and Ωd is the constant volume factor of the d dimensional hypersphere (Ωd = 1,π,4π / 3 for d = 1,2,3 respectively and d + 1 is often called as the Avrami exponent) [\cite=kn.kolmogorov]. Recently, the derivation of correlation function and its connection to the scattering cross-section [\cite=kn.sekimoto], theory of grain-size populations [\cite=kn.population], and the generalization of the KJMA theory to multiple stable phase [\cite=kn.multiphase] has made a significant contribution as it now provide a better means of interpreting the experimental data. Alongside, there have been reports too that the experimental data in some cases do not fit a straight line in the plots of log  log [Φ(t)] against log [t] [\cite=kn.price] [\cite=kn.sessa]. It clearly raises some concerns and hence it requires further theoretical interest in order to find varients of the model which would be suitable under different physical situations.

In this paper, we lift the restriction imposed by the rule (ii), the conventional constant growth velocity, by choosing various form of velocities. Precisely, we choose velocities that decreases as the system proceeds and check how such decreasing grwoth velocities of different strength influence the resulting dynamics. In fact, a more realistic theory does require the inclusion of a growth velocity that may change in the course of time. The idea to move away from the constant growth velocity is born by the following observation. The problem in question is intrinsically a kinetic one and hence, as the time proceeds, the size and shape of both the phases change continuously altering the strength of their competition between the surface tension and the free energy density difference between the two phases. The strength of this competition is the one that ultimately determines the growth velocity. This implies that the growth velocity of S-phase should therefore depend either on time or on the size and shape of one, or both, of the phases or on proper combinations of all these parameters in some sense. The inlcusion of velocity, that is not constant, appears to reveal a number of new interesting results. The most significant of all is the emergence of the scale invariant fractal geometry accompanied by a power-law decay of M-phase instead of the traditional exponential decay. We show that the system exhibits such fascinating behaviour only if the growth velocity decreases as the system eveolves. To be more precise, the systems exhibit scale-free fractal if the growth velocity at any given time t depends on the mean size s(t) of M-phase i.e., v = s(t) / t or if it depends on the mean nucleation time τ(x) i.e., v = x / τ(x).

In this work, we mainly focus on extracting the key features of the phenomena (at least thier qualitative behaviour) with the least possible mathematical complexity. We therefore choose the one-dimensional (1d) system as we can solve it for some special cases analytically and exactly. The 1d model can in fact fully capture the qualitative bahaviour of the key quantities of interest namely the decay of M-phase. The Kolmogorov-Avrami formula itself is a testament to its justification which clearly shows that the exponential decay of M-phase is common to all dimensions. The distribution function C(x,t) of M-phase of size x at time t for random nucleation and growth mechanism evolves according to the following integro-differential equation

[formula]

The first two terms on the right hand side represent the decrease and increase of interval size x of M-phase due to the nucleation of S-phase on x and y > x respectively. Every nucleation event creates two new intervals. The factor `2' in the integral term implies that either of the two new intervals can be of size x. Finally, the third term on the right hand side is derived by taking into account all the possible ways the distribution function C(x,t) still remains in the size range

[formula]

. In passing, we note that in this model too the average interval size s(t) decays as s(t) = t- 1.

(d) Finally, we consider the case where v(x,t) = mx / τ(x), however, according to Eq.([\ref=eq:g]), the typical time τ between two nucleation events on an interval of size x is τ = x- 1 and therefore v(x,t) = mx2 revealing that the growth velocity decreases increasingly fast as the size of M-phase decreases since x itself is a decreasing quantity with time. For simplicity reason, we only consider the case m = 1. Invoking a simple dimensional analysis allows us the following scaling ansatz

[formula]

such that tw bears the dimension of C(x,t) and φ(ξ) is the scaling function. Upon substituting the ansatz into Eq. ([\ref=eq:g]) and seeking the self-similar solution immediately reduces the original partial integro-differential equation into an ordinary hypergeometric differential equation for φ(ξ)

[formula]

The most nontrivial feature of φ(ξ) is its universality, in the sense that it is independent of the initial condition. The only physically acceptable solution of the above equation is

[formula]

and asymptotically it behaves as φ(ξ)  ~   exp [null] [\cite=kn.luke]. The yet undetermined exponent w of the scaling ansatz is fixed by the conservation principle. However, as the intervals of M-phase are lost to S-phase, the system violates the simple mass conservation. Nevertheless, it still obeys a conservation law although this time it is a non-trivial quantity as we shall see below. To do so, we incorporate the definition of Mn(t) into Eq. ([\ref=eq:g]) and then, after some simple algebraic manipulations, we are able to write the following rate equation for Mn(t)

[formula]

Thereafter, demanding the steady state condition dMn(t) / dt = 0 immediately reveals that it is the value [formula] that fixes the exponent [formula]. The asymptotic solution for C(x,t) is therefore,

[formula]

We thus find that Φ(t) decays algebraically with a non-trivial exponent 0.5857 whereas N(t) grows with an exponent 0.4142. However, the average interval of M-phase s(t) decays exactly like all previous three cases i.e., s(t)  ~  t- 1. For model (c) too, we could substitute the ansatz Eq. ([\ref=eq:ansatz]) into Eq. ([\ref=eq:g]) and find that the scaling function φ(ξ) obeys an ordinary differential equation. Its solution would have been the same as we obtained by using the direct method, Eq. ([\ref=eq:c]). This further supports the fact that the model (c) admits scaling. However, applying the same treatment to the model (a) and (b) would immediately reveal that neither of these two cases yield a reduction to an ordinary differential equation of one variable. This suggests that the model (a) and (b) do not admit a scaling solution. In fact, the exponential decay of M-phase, is a clear signature of the violation of scaling. It is note worthy to mention that the number density in (c) and (d) increases for all time - a sharp contrast with the models (a) and (b) where N(t) increases only at the early stage. This is due to the fact that in models (c) and (d), the growth velocity decreases in time in such a way that two growing phases from opposite direction hardly coalesce. In fact, the growth of S-phase virtually stops prior to coalescence.

The existence of scaling and the non-trivial exponent of Φ(t) provides an extra motivation to go beyond the simple scaling description. This can be done by invoking the idea of fractal analysis, as it has been a very useful tool to obtain a global exponent called fractal dimension. To do so, we need a proper yardstick to measure the size of the set created in the long time limit. The most convenient one is the average interval size s(t)  ~  t- 1. Using this yardstick, we find that the number of s(t) we need to cover the system scales as

[formula]

The exponent df is known as the fractal dimension or the Hausdorff-Besicovitch dimension [\cite=kn.fractal] of the resulting set created by the nucleation and growth process. For v(x,t) = k / t2, we find df = (1 - k) and v(x,t) = x2 yields df = 0.4142. For general m in (d), the fractal dimension is [formula] (for further details see [\cite=kn.hassan]). In both cases ((c) and (d)), the Kolmogorov-Avrami formula can be replaced by the following general power-law decay of M-phase

[formula]

It reveals a generalised exponent (1 - df) that can quantify the extent of decay of M-phase. The coverage θ(t) by the S-phase reaches its asymptotic value θ(  ∞  ) = 1 again follow a power-law

[formula]

which is reminscent of the Feder's law in RSA [\cite=kn.feder].

To put it into a context, we have studied the random nucleation and growth processes of a stable phase for different growth velocities. So far, the KJMA model has only been been studied with constant velocity. However, we conceive in systems where the dynamics is governed by the nucleation and growth processes, it is more logical to consider that the growth velocity of S-phase may depend on the size of M-phase present at every instant of time. Invoking the idea of such velocites, we have found the following interesting and previously unknown results. The average interval size s(t) of M-phase shows a power-law decay s(t)  ~  t- 1 irrespective of the detailed choice of the velocity. The fraction of M-phase that still survive at any given time is very sensitive to the specific choice of the velocity. The resulting structure exhibits a scale-invariant fractal if only the growth velocity depends on either the mean size of the M-phase s(t) or on the mean nucleation time τ(x) at every instant of time. Moreover, only in such cases the system show a power-law decay of the M-phase and we hve shown that exponent of the decay law can be generalised (1 - df) by incorporating the fractal dimension df. However, in the case where both or one of the parameter of the definition of velocity is assumed a constant value (e.g., v = v0 or v = constant / t) the decay is exponential in nature which is always accompanied by the violation of scaling.

We conclude with the following words. The power-law decay of M-phase can be assumed to be a generalized formula replacing the classical Kolmogorov-Avrami law, provided, the distribution of M-phase in the late stage describes a scale-free fractal. The fractal diemsnion df is the quantitative measure of the notion that the density of M-phase is less at larger length scale. We believe that the present work will have a significant impact in changing the way we intended to interpret the experimental data as we are now aware of the fascinating results due to the decelerating growth velocity.
