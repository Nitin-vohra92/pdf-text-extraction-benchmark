Hydrodynamic aspects of Relativistic Heavy Ion Collisions at RHIC

Overview

Among the many predictions[\cite=Eskola01] made for observables of collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), hydrodynamic calculations regarding the expected flow characteristics[\cite=KSH00] [\cite=TLS01] turned out to be surprisingly accurate already a few months after running the new facility.[\cite=STARv201] In fact, those predictions were so convincing that they were awarded a bottle of wine in the RHIC prediction competition.[\cite=RHICpredictioncontest] That RHIC creates systems which - for the dominant part of their lifetimes - expand according to hydrodynamic principles is of utmost importance: The dynamical evolution is governed by the nuclear equation of state at extreme energies, whose thermodynamic features are thus accessible through collisions in the laboratory.

In the following, I will review indications of the strong transverse expansion that can be deduced from the observable final state of central and non-central Au+Au collisions. Thereby, I will pay particular attention to signals of collectivity at mid-rapidity, i.e. in the plane perpendicular to the beam-axis in the center of mass of the reaction (at vanishing pseudorapidity η). Although interesting phenomena are to be expected at η  ≠  0, to which I will return later, the midrapidity region is of particular interest for the observation of collectivity: Before the reaction, there is no transverse component of motion. Observing collectivity in the transverse plane at midrapidity must thus be a result of the dynamical evolution of the fireball after the initial impact. In contrast, at rapidities η  ≠  0, it is difficult to disentangle collectivity created by the fireball region and the longitudinal dynamics of the nuclei that was present already before the reaction.

To address the questions of the how and when those collective features in the transverse plane are established, I will turn to dynamical models and specifically introduce the formalism of hydrodynamics to study the temporal evolution of the fireball matter in this framework. This analysis makes the success of the simple formulas of blast wave parameterizations understandable and validates such a simplistic approach as a tool to rapidly characterize and summarize the main thermodynamic information of the final state.

I will then highlight the most important comparisons of experimental data and hydrodynamic calculations and their interpretation, before I give a detailed account on recent and future developments that can be expected in the field. Almost every single observable of heavy ion physics is influenced by the bulk matter, as the bulk provides the background of the evolution through which even the rare probes have to propagate. Now, with hydrodynamics, we have a tool to calculate the dynamics of this evolution.

Indications of strong transverse flow

If the microscopic constituents of a flowing medium share a common average flow velocity [formula], heavier particles in this medium gain larger momenta than the lighter constituents. In the case of the late stages of heavy ion collisions, the flowing medium is the hadronic soup consisting of hadrons of widely varying masses. From experimental evidence we find that the hadronic abundancies reflect a composition of a hadronic gas at a temperature Tchem  ~  175  MeV.[\cite=BMMRS01] Refinements of the simple blast wave model[\cite=SR79] [\cite=SSH93] assume the knowledge of a certain flow profile at the break up stage of the reaction as well as the shape of this surface of decoupling from which particles supposedly do not interact any further. In this way one achieves a handy formalism,[\cite=BF01] that can easily be used to fit to the vast amount of data currently available from RHIC experiments, in particular to single particles spectra and eventually their anisotropies.[\cite=RL03] Although the temperature parameter of these fits differs widely from 175 MeV [\cite=BF01] to 100 MeV,[\cite=RL03] the common finding of these model calculation is that a vast amount of transverse flow (with an average velocity greater than c / 2) is achieved on a rather short time scale of about 10 fm/ c. While the stunningly good description hints that there possibly is some physical truth underlying these parameterizations, these simple descriptions of the final state do not offer any insight how and when such strong transverse flow develops during the course of the evolution. For this, we have to turn to a fully dynamical description of the transverse expansion stage of the reaction.

Hydrodynamic formalism and phenomenology

There are two main philosophies to model the dynamical evolution of a system. If the system is small and the scattering processes can be treated individually, one can adapt a microscopic viewpoint, treating all the collisions of the constituents individually.[\cite=MG00] In a very dense, strongly interacting medium, however, this approach becomes quickly impractical, particularly if one also were to consider low-momentum transfer processes consistently. Alternatively, in this limit of high density and strong rescattering, one can give up the particles' individual personality, and characterize the system in terms of density fields and continuity equations. Ideally, if scattering is strong enough to allow for local thermodynamic equilibrium, the equations of energy momentum conservation can be formulated by the thermodynamic equivalent, the conservation of the thermodynamic energy-momentum tensor, [formula] . The energy density e and the pressure p are related by the thermodynamic equation of state of nuclear matter. uμ is the collective four velocity, whose time evolution we can study within this formalism. Once supplied with appropriate initial conditions, which are often taken from geometric considerations[\cite=KHHET01] or more fundamental models such as the saturation model[\cite=KHHET01] or the color glass condensate,[\cite=HN04] the system's evolution is fully determined. At this point, the computer takes over to solve for the time evolution of the thermodynamic fields.

Fig. [\ref=Fig1] shows the temporal evolution of the entropy density on a double logarithmic scale for three different positions in the fireball of a central collision, 0, 3 and 5 fm away from the fireball center.[\cite=Kolb03] The tangents drawn to the curve stress the occurring transition from the initial one-dimensional, longitudinal expansion to a fully 3-dimensional expansion at late stages. The right plot of Fig. [\ref=Fig1] shows the radial flow profile at different times throughout the evolution. Striking here is the fast transition to a linear profile, which persists throughout time. Still, as matter is continually moved to larger radii, the mean transverse velocity of the medium increases and transverse flow thus continues to increase. The main part of the fireball matter is know to freeze-out over a rather short time frame as the rescattering rate drops sharply as a function of temperature, and therefore even more so as function of time. This fact, together with the rapid development of a flat flow profile is at the heart of the applicability of the simple and the improved blast wave parameterizations.

In contrast to the overall radial flow which increases throughout the lifetime of the system, anisotropies in the transverse flow profile are generated during the earliest instances of the reaction. Such anisotropies arise from the eccentricity in coordinate space of non-central collisions. Larger pressure gradients in the short direction (the direction of the impact parameter) lead to a larger transport of matter in this direction, thereby reducing the eccentricity and undermining the source of its own origin.[\cite=Sorge97] In the course of this process more particles are transported into the direction of the impact parameter and the mean transverse momentum of the particles is greater, both of which manifests itself experimentally in anisotropies vn of the transverse momentum spectra [formula] It has been shown in many studies, both microscopically[\cite=ZGK99] as well as macroscopically[\cite=KSH00] [\cite=Kolb03] that those momentum anisotropies are generated during the first 5 fm/c of the reaction, where most of the matter is still at temperatures exceeding the critical temperature of nuclear matter. Anisotropies in the transverse momentum spectra of hadrons thus originate from the partonic stage of the fireball and signals their collective behavior.[\cite=KSH00]

Application to experimental observations

As mentioned before, the transverse momentum distribution at moderate pT are the natural choice of observables to study collective dynamical effects in the medium. We use the transverse momentum spectra of identified particles to determine the parameters of the calculation for RHIC at 200 GeV center of mass energy per nucleon. Those spectra are well reproduced applying an equilibration time of τequ  =  0.6  fm / c and a central fireball temperature of 360 MeV.[\cite=KR03] Although the particle ratios reflect chemical equilibrium at a temperature of about 175 MeV,[\cite=BMMRS01] the slopes in particular of heavier baryons require further transverse accelertion down to temperatures of about 100 MeV.[\cite=KH03] To keep the particle ratios fixed to their value at 175 MeV, chemical potentials seem to be dynamically generated throughout the evolution.[\cite=Rapp02] [\cite=Teaney02] [\cite=HT02]

Although the good reproduction of the spectra of central collisions is reassuring, it has been achieved to a great deal by adjusting the parameters of the calculation. Important predictions come into play in non-central collisions. Changing centrality, which introduces a breaking of the azimuthal symmetry inherent in central collisions, renders essentially all observables sensitive on the azimuthal angle of observation. This literally opens up an entirely new dimension of observable space. However, for fully dynamical simulations no additional parameters are introduced when stepping out to explore observables in this new dimension. The modified initialization for non-central collisions is stricktly determined by the geometry of the underlying initialization scenario. The only appearing parameter - the impact parameter b - is estimated experimentally by giving the range of centrality for certain collisions.

We already mentioned the great significance of momentum anisotropies as they provide a signal from the first few fm/c of the collision. Microscopic studies[\cite=MG00] in comparison with experimental data show that the fireball constituents must undergo an incredible amount of rescattering among themselves. Hydrodynamic calculations, which exploit the limit of negligible mean free pathlengths, provide an impressive account of a large collection of momentum anisotropies.[\cite=KH03] They give a good overall description of momentum anisotropies up to transverse momenta of 2 GeV (Pions) and even 4 GeV for Baryons. The centrality dependence of the hydrodynamic elliptic anisotropy compares well with experimental data as long as the impact parameter does not get too large. Finally, the mass characteristics, a flatter onset of momentum anisotropies at small transverse momenta,[\cite=HKHRV01] is confirmed by experiment in stunningly good agreement. A recent compilation of momentum anisotropies of heavy particles is reprinted in Fig. [\ref=Fig2] (right panel).[\cite=STAR02v2KLambda] Still more recently the momentum anisotropies of Cascades and Omegas have become available.[\cite=Castillo04] Again, those anisotropies have been stunningly large, as predicted 3 years ago by hydrodynamic calculations.[\cite=HKHRV01] As the multistrange resonances are believe to not interact strongly in a hadron gas, this is the clearest signal that strangeness anisotropy is generated in the partonic stage of the reaction. It appears that all quark flavors share the same flow anisotropy on the partonic level. This fact could be most prominently (dis-)proved by investigating momentum anisotropies of higher order and their ratios.[\cite=v4] That the momentum anisotropies are as large as observed is a strong indication that the thermalization of the medium is achieved very rapidly.[\cite=thermalization] The fact that hydrodynamics overestimates anisotropies at large transverse momenta and in peripheral collisions is well understood, considering that high pT particles escape the fireball too rapidly to follow the collective motion of the bulk, and that small systems do not provide enough rescattering in the limited volume. Here, it is also important to remark that while hydrodynamics does not seem to be fully applicable at the lower beam energies of the SPS in peripheral collisions, there might still be a fair chance for its quantitative application in central collisions. This could be in particular true for the early, plasma part of the reaction, whereas the later hadronic stage might drop out of local thermal equilibrium. Only detailed quantitative comparisons of hydrodynamic calculations and the most recent results[\cite=NA49] from SPS experiments can answer this question and address important topics close to thermal equilibrium and just above the transition temperature.

Current trends and future requirements

Most of the hydrodynamic calculations that are applied to experimental data at present include some great simplifications in order to keep the numerical efforts to a reasonable degree. One of these is the strong bias to investigations of observables at midrapidity. Although the collectivity observed at midrapidity is clearly produced during the evolution of the produced fireball and therefore contains clean probes of the dynamics, a broader view of the full collision volume is highly desirable, in particular in the light of recent data extending the analysis of momentum anisotropies to large rapidities. Fully three-dimensional calculations have been successfully performed in recent years.[\cite=MMNH02] However not too much is gained by applying the ideal hydrodynamic calculations at large forward rapidities as the system is thought reach thermal equilibrium only at later times[\cite=KH04] or not at all[\cite=Hirano01] in regions far away from the center of mass of the reaction.

Nevertheless, there is a lot to be gained from investigations of hydrodynamic calculations at non-zero rapidity. Due to the (net)-baryon content of the initial nuclei, one can expect that the (net) baryon-number density increases with increasing rapidity. As one leaves the 'clean' midrapidity region with its antibaryon to baryon ratio of about 0.75, one gets closer to the initial nuclei region where the antibaryon content effectively vanishes. Thus, at larger rapidity, a hydrodynamical system evolves according to the equation of state at larger baryon chemical potential than at mid-rapidity. This offers the exciting possibility of tracing signals of the expected tricritical point at finite rapidity. The effect of the tricritical point on the hydrodynamic evolution of RHIC collisions is currently explored by Nonaka.[\cite=NonakaBNL03] It was found that such a point acts as an attractor for the thermodynamic paths of a constant fraction of entropy and baryon-density. Clearly, due to the large fluctuations that appear around the critical point, the ideal hydrodynamic treatment will become invalid, but it will be interesting to explore how the system drops out of equilibrium, and which quantitative experimental measurements will be predicted.

The less efficient energy density production and deposition at large rapidity eventually leads to a breakdown of the assumption of full thermalization and an ideal expansion. Viscous effects will become more and more important in smaller and more dilute systems. It is of fundamental interest to get estimates of the viscosity of the QCD plasma state. Viscous hydrodynamics can deliver valuable information in this direction. The realization of fully dynamical hydrodynamical calculations is however difficult. The viscous terms have to be solved dynamically, increasing the number of differential equations by up to 5 (depending on the symmetries one exploits explicitly). Although difficult to solve,[\cite=Muronga04] first results on the dynamical evolution of central collisions have recently been presented.[\cite=Teaney04] The message of these dynamical studies is that viscous matter sticks together for a longer period, just to blow up quicker in the late stages. The left panel of Fig. [\ref=Fig3] shows plots of the energy density as a function of the transverse coordinate for a viscous calculation compared to the ideal Euler calculation.[\cite=Teaney04] Although the densities change slower at first, velocities build up faster due to a restructuring of the pressure components, which is also observed in the case of only transverse thermalization and longitudinal free streaming.[\cite=HW02] Finally, in the late stage of the reaction, the left over matter dissipates more rapidly, due to the larger velocities that were achieved. The net result is that the system stays longer in the hot phase of its reaction and disperses faster through the late stages. The late stages, for which viscosity become increasingly important, thus have a shorter lifetime and freeze-out occurs more rapidly. Comforting is the observation that viscosity does not lead to self-enhancing features!

In this context it is also interesting to cast doubt on the assumption of having particles distributed in momentum space according to the simple ideal distribution laws of Fermions and Bosons. It has been shown[\cite=Teaney03] that a large deviation from these distributions smears out the directed collective motion observed in the momentum anisotropies and is thus not supported by the data (see right panel of Fig. [\ref=Fig3].)

Summary

We have learned a lot about the collective phenomena exhibited in RHIC data of the first few years. The data clearly show many characteristics of rapid thermalization and an extended stage of hydrodynamic expansion of the fireball into the surrounding vacuum. On a linear timescale, the hydrodynamic stage is the most significant stage of the reaction, thereby influencing many other relevant observables. Hydrodynamics is a clean (meaning well defined) tool, with only a small number of parameters and easily reproducible by anybody having access to a computer. The two most important facts learned from hydrodynamics and the experimental data so far is the need for rapid thermalization (in a time of less than 1 fm/c) where matter obtains a large transverse push due to a hard equation of state (p  ~  e / 3). Many quantitative questions are still unanswered: What is the frame of error around the equilibration time, what different kinds of equations of state and phase transitions would still account for the data, how does one feed back on the other? What is the role of viscosity in the expansion? Why does viscosity of high temperature QCD matter seem to be so low as to allow for an ideal hydrodynamic description of the data?
