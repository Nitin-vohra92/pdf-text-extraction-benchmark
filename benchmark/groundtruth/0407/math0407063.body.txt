Twistor Forms on Riemannian Products

Twistor Forms on Riemannian Manifolds

A twistor p-form on a Riemannian manifold   (Mn,  g) is a smooth section ψ of ΛpT*M whose covariant derivative only depends on its differential dψ and codifferential δψ. More precisely, ψ satisfies the equation

[formula]

for all vector fields X, where [formula] denotes the metric dual of X.

If the p-form ψ is in addition coclosed ( i.e. δψ = 0), then it is called a Killing p-form. We denote by [formula], [formula] and [formula] the spaces of twistor, Killing and parallel forms on M respectively. Notice that [formula] is preserved by Hodge duality, and that the Hodge dual of a Killing form is a closed twistor form. For a comprehensive introduction to twistor forms, see [\cite=uwe].

A few years ago, a program of classification of twistor forms on compact manifolds was started. By the de Rham decomposition theorem, every simply connected Riemannian manifold is a Riemannian product of irreducible manifolds. Moreover, the Berger-Simons holonomy theorem (see [\cite=besse], p. 300) implies that any simply connected irreducible Riemannian manifold is either symmetric or has holonomy SOn, Um, SUm, Spk, Spk  ·  1, G2 or Spin7. Killing forms on symmetric spaces were studied in [\cite=bms]. Twistor forms on Kähler manifolds (covering the holonomies Um, SUm, and Spk) were described in [\cite=ms1], and Killing forms on quaternion-Kähler manifolds (holonomy Spk  ·  1) or Joyce manifolds (holonomies G2 or Spin7) were studied in [\cite=ms2] and [\cite=uwe1] respectively. In Theorem [\ref=th] below, we prove that the general case (twistor forms on a Riemannian product of compact manifolds) reduces to the study of Killing forms on the factors. By the discussion above, besides the case of generic holonomy (SOn), all other cases are fully understood.

The Main Result

Let M = M1  ×  M2 be the Riemannian product of two compact Riemannian manifolds (M1,g1) and (M2,g2) of dimensions m and n respectively. We denote by πi the projection πi:M  →  Mi. From ([\ref=killing]) it is clear that [formula], so the space

[formula]

is a subspace of [formula]. For later use, we give the following description of [formula]:

[formula]

and

[formula]

The aim of this note is to prove the following result:

Since [formula] and [formula], we clearly have [formula]. It remains to prove the reverse inclusion. Let us define the differential operators

[formula]

where {ei} and {fj} denote local orthonormal basis of the tangent distributions to M1 and M2. Using the Fubini theorem, we easily see that the adjoint operators to d1 and d2 are

[formula]

The following relations are straightforward:

[formula]

[formula]

The vector bundle ΛpM decomposes naturally as

[formula]

where [formula] Obviously, d1 and δ1 map Λi,p - iM to Λi + 1,p - iM and Λi - 1,p - iM respectively, and d2 and δ2 map Λi,p - iM to Λi,p - i + 1M and Λi,p - i - 1M respectively.

With respect to the above decomposition, every p-form can be written [formula], where [formula]. From now on, u will denote a twistor p-form [formula], with 1  ≤  p  ≤  n + m - 1. The twistor equation reads

[formula]

By projection onto the different irreducible components of ΛpM, ([\ref=tw]) can be translated into the following two systems of equations:

[formula]

and

[formula]

Recall that if u is any k-form and [formula] is an orthonormal basis on a manifold M, then

[formula]

Taking the wedge product with [formula] in ([\ref=tw1]) and summing over an orthonormal basis of TM1 yields

[formula]

so

[formula]

Similarly, taking the interior product with X and summing over an orthonormal basis of TM1 yields [formula], thus

[formula]

We distinguish three cases:

Case I. Suppose that p is strictly smaller than m and n. For k < p, ([\ref=t1]) and ([\ref=t2]) imply

[formula]

Integrating over M yields [formula]. Similarly one gets [formula]. Moreover, we have 0 = δ2up  =  δ1u0 (tautologically), so in particular [formula]. From ([\ref=tw1]) and ([\ref=tw2]), together with ([\ref=c1]) and ([\ref=c2]), we see that [formula], [formula] and [formula], so [formula].

Case II. Suppose that p is strictly larger than m and n. Since the Hodge dual * u of u is a twistor (m + n - p)-form and m + n - p is strictly smaller than m and n, the first case implies that [formula], so [formula].

Case III. If p is a number between m and n, we may suppose without loss of generality that m  ≤  p  ≤  n. Obviously [formula]=0. Using ([\ref=tt]) and integrating over M, we obtain that 0 = d1uk  =  δ2uk for 0  ≤  k  ≤  m - 1 and similarly, 0 = d2uk  =  δ1uk for 1  ≤  k  ≤  m. As before, ([\ref=tw1]) and ([\ref=tw2]), together with ([\ref=c1]) and ([\ref=c2]), show that [formula], [formula], and [formula]. This proves the theorem.

As an application of this result, we have the following:

Assume first that (M,g) = (M1,g1)  ×  (M2,g2) is a Riemannian product with [formula] Then, taking into account that the isomorphism between 1-forms and vector fields defined by the Riemannian metric maps twistor forms to conformal vector fields and Killing forms to Killing vector fields, Theorem [\ref=th] implies that every conformal vector field on M is a Killing vector field. Thus M is irreducible.

Assume next that [formula]. From the Berger-Simons holonomy theorem ([\cite=besse], p. 300), M is either an irreducible symmetric space (in particular Einstein), or its holonomy group is Um, SUm, Spk, Spk  ·  1, G2 or Spin7. In the first three cases the manifold is Kähler and in the last three cases it is Einstein. Now, two classical results state that a conformal vector field on a compact manifold M is already a Killing vector field if M is Kähler (see [\cite=li], p. 148) or if M is Einstein and not isometric to the round sphere (see [\cite=na], [\cite=na-ya]).

The only possibility left is therefore [formula].

Example. Take any compact simply connected Riemannian manifold (Mn,g) carrying a Killing vector field ξ and let f be a function on M such that ξ(f) is not identically zero. Since L  ξ(e2fg) = 2ξ(f)e2fg, ξ is a conformal vector field on (M,e2fg) which is not Killing. From Proposition [\ref=pr], (M,e2fg) has holonomy SOn.

Since f is non-constant, there exists x∈M such that dfx  ≠  0. Killing vector fields on M span the tangent spaces at each point, so in particular there exist a Killing vector field ξ such that ξ(f) is not identically zero. The corollary then follows from the example above.
