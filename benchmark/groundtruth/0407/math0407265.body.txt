Introduction

Throughout the paper, let [formula] and [formula] denote the sets of non-positive and non-negative integers, respectively. The Gauss hypergeometric function is defined by the series

[formula]

The hypergeometric series terminate when [formula] or [formula]; the function is undefined when [formula]. If n,N are non-negative integers and n  ≤  N, then we interpret ([\ref=hpggauss]) as a terminating hypergeometric series. Gauss hypergeometric function can be analytically continued onto [formula]. It satisfies the hypergeometric differential equation

[formula]

Throughout the paper, we denote this equation by E(a,b,c). Since Kummer we know that in general there are 24 hypergeometric series which express solutions of E(a,b,c). The subject of this paper is Gauss hypergeometric functions when some or all of the numbers a, b, c, c - a, c - b, a - b, c - a - b are integers. We refer to these functions and to corresponding hypergeometric equations as degenerate. (Note that in [\cite=bateman] and [\cite=abrostegun], a hypergeometric equation is called degenerate only when a, b, c - a or c - b are integers.) In a degenerate case, some of the 24 Kummer's hypergeometric solutions are terminating or undefined, relations between them degenerate. The monodromy group of E(a,b,c) deserves a separate description in most of these cases. In particular, there are terminating hypergeometric solutions if and only if the monodromy group is reducible.

Bases of solutions for degenerate hypergeometric equations are presented in [\cite=bateman]. Some of those solutions are reproduced in [\cite=abrostegun]. Logarithmic solutions are derived in several texts, for example in [\cite=specfaar]. Generators for the monodromy group in all degenerate cases are given in [\cite=gausspainleve]. Transformations of terminating Gauss hypergeometric series are widely used (see [\cite=koekswart] for example), but they are seldom fully exhibited. Here we present hypergeometric solutions of degenerate hypergeometric equations and relations between them more explicitly and systematically. Our Theorem [\ref=dendcases] and Corollary [\ref=abcases] give convenient characterization of various degenerate cases.

General observations

Hypergeometric equation E(a,b,c) is a Fuchsian equation with three regular singular points z = 0, z = 1 and z =   ∞  . The local exponents are:

[formula]

Permutations of the three singular points and of their local exponents are realized by transformations y(z)  ↦  z-  α(1 - z)-  β  y(φ(z)) of E(a,b,c) to other hypergeometric equations, where

[formula]

and α,β are suitably chosen from the set {0,a,b,1 - c,c - a - b}. We refer to these transformations of hypergeometric equations as the fractional-linear transformations.

In general, E(a,b,c) can be transformed to 23 other hypergeometric equations by the fractional-linear transformations. Consequently, there are 24 hypergeometric series representing solutions of E(a,b,c); they are commonly referred to as the 24 Kummer's solutions. These solutions and general relations between them are fully presented in [\cite=bateman]. In general, the 24 hypergeometric series represent 6 different Gauss hypergeometric functions, since Euler's and Pfaff's formulas [\cite=specfaar] identify four Kummer's series with each other. We refer to those identities as the Euler-Pfaff transformations.

If we consider permutation of the upper parameters a, b as a non-trivial transformation, we have a group of 48 elements acting on hypergeometric equations. This group acts on the parameters of E(a,b,c) as follows.

Fractional-linear transformations can permute the three numbers 1 - c, c - a - b, b - a and change their signs in any way.

Fractional-linear transformations can permute the four numbers

[formula]

in any way, and can change their signs simultaneously.

Proof. We define e0 = 1 - c, e1 = c - a - b, e∞ = b - a. Note that e0, e1, e∞ are the local exponent differences of E(a,b,c) at the singular points. The first statement is clear once one accepts characterization of fractional-linear transformations as the transformations of hypergeometric equations which permute the three singular points and their local exponents. (Notice that interchanging local exponents at a singular point changes the sign of the local exponent difference.)

For the second statement, notice that the four listed numbers are equal to

[formula]

By the first statement, we can permute ei's and change their signs. If we change the signs of even number of ei's, the four numbers get permuted; otherwise they get multiplied by - 1 and permuted.

Alternatively, one can show both statements by checking the list of 24 related hypergeometric equations:

[formula]

The purpose of this paper is to present solutions (and relations between them) of degenerate hypergeometric equations. These equations usually have terminating or undefined hypergeometric solutions. In particular, if the local exponent difference at a singular point is an integer, then that point is either logarithmic or there is a terminating local solution at that point. At a logarithmic point there is only one local solution of the form [formula], where x is a local parameter there. To get a basis of local solutions at a logarithmic point, one has to use the function log x.

Terminating solutions occur if a, b, c - a or c - b is an integer. Then the hypergeometric equation has reducible monodromy group. Conversely, if the monodromy group is reducible, the hypergeometric equation has a solution which changes by a constant multiple under any monodromy action. The logarithmic derivative of such a solution is a rational function of z, which eventually means that the solution has a terminating series expression. This is clear from the Kovacic algorithm in differential Galois theory [\cite=kovacic], [\cite=vdputsing].

We recall briefly the role of the monodromy group. This group characterizes analytic continuation of solutions of the hypergeometric equation along paths in [formula]; see [\cite=beukers]. Once a basis of local solutions at a non-singular point is chosen, we get a two-dimensional representation of the monodromy group. In general, the monodromy group is generated by two elements, say, those corresponding to paths circling z = 0 or z = 1 once. Fractional-linear transformations of E(a,b,c) do not change the monodromy group. We are especially interested in the cases when a monodromy representation is a subgroup (up to conjugation) of the following subgroups of [formula]:

[formula]

The groups [formula] and [formula] are isomorphic to the multiplicative group [formula] and the additive group [formula], respectively. For Fuchsian equations, the monodromy group is closely related to the differential Galois group [\cite=vdputsing]. The groups [formula], [formula] are examples of possible differential Galois groups for hypergeometric equations.

Here is a convenient characterization of hypergeometric equations with various types of monodromy groups.

Consider a hypergeometric equation E(a,b,c).

The monodromy group is irreducible if and only if none of the numbers a, b, c - a, c - b is an integer.

If the monodromy group is abelian, then the sequence a, b, c - a, c - b contains at least two integers.

Suppose that the sequence a, 1 - b, c - a, 1 + b - c contains precisely two integers. If those two integers are either both positive or both non-positive, then a monodromy representation is a non-trivial subgroup of [formula]. Otherwise the monodromy group is not abelian.

Suppose that the numbers a, b, c are integers. If the sequence a, b, c - a, c - b contains odd number of positive integers, then the monodromy group is trivial. Otherwise a monodromy representation is a non-trivial subgroup of [formula].

Proof. The first statement is a direct consequence of [\cite=gausspainleve]. Alternatively, this is [\cite=beukers]. The second statement is [\cite=beukers]. Alternatively, one can go through cases (B.2), (B.2)', (B.2)'', (C) of [\cite=gausspainleve]. For the third statement, we may assume due to fractional-linear transformations that a,c - a are integers, and that c  ≥  1. Then we are in part (B) of [\cite=gausspainleve], with ρ1  -  ρ2 = c - 1 there. We have to check whether 0 < ρ1  +  σi  +  τj  ≤  ρ1  -  ρ2 for those i,j∈{1,2} with [formula]. We have ρ1  +  σi  +  τj∈{a,  c - a,  b,  c - b}, therefore we are in case (B.2) if the two integers are both positive, and we are in case (B.1) if a  ≤  0 and c - a > 0. The monodromy generators of case (B.1) do not commute, and they are (up to conjugation) inside [formula] in case (B.2). Fractional-linear transformations preserve the property that the two integers in the sequence a,1 - b,c - a,1 + b - c are either both positive, or both non-positive.

For the last statement, we use part (C) of [\cite=gausspainleve]. It is enough to show that if the sequence a,b,c - a,c - b contains odd number of positive integers then we are in case (C.2). Up to fractional-linear transformations, we may assume that a  ≤  0 and that the other three integers are positive. Then a  ≤  0 < b < c. We have ρ1  -  ρ2 = c - 1, σ1  -  σ2 = c - a - b, and for i,j∈{1,2} we have

[formula]

We check that 0 < ρ1  +  σi  +  τj  ≤  ρ1  -  ρ2 for any i,j∈{1,2} in the context of part (B) in [\cite=gausspainleve], and 0 < ρi  +  σ1  +  τj  ≤  σ1  -  σ2 for any i,j∈{1,2} in the context of part (B)'. This means that we are indeed in case (C.2). Fractional-linear transformations preserve the property that the sequence a,b,c - a,c - b contains odd number of positive integers. [formula]

Proof. Parts 2, 3, 4 of Theorem [\ref=dendcases] describe mutually exclusive cases for possible abelian monodromy groups of E(a,b,c). [formula]

In Sections [\ref=terminating] through [\ref=additive] below we study various degenerate cases of Gauss hypergeometric functions. We concentrate on relations between their hypergeometric and logarithmic solutions. Here we present general forms of hypergeometric equations for each degeneration type.

Suppose that a hypergeometric equation has terminating hypergeometric solutions, non-abelian monodromy, and does not have logarithmic points. Up to fractional-linear transformations, the hypergeometric equation has the form E( - n,a,c), where [formula] and [formula].

Suppose that a hypergeometric equation has logarithmic points, but does not have terminating hypergeometric solutions. Up to fractional-linear transformations, the hypergeometric equation has the form E(a,b,m + 1), with [formula] and [formula].

Suppose that a hypergeometric equation has terminating solutions and logarithmic points, and that the monodromy group is not abelian. Up to fractional-linear transformations, the hypergeometric equation has the form E(a, - n,m + 1), with [formula] and [formula].

Suppose that a monodromy representation of a hypergeometric equation is a non-trivial subgroup of [formula]. Up to fractional-linear transformations, the hypergeometric equation has the form E( - n,a - m, - n - m), with [formula] and [formula].

Up to fractional-linear transformations, a hypergeometric equation with the trivial monodromy group has the form [formula], with [formula].

Suppose that a monodromy representation of a hypergeometric equation is a non-trivial subgroup of [formula]. Up to fractional-linear transformations, the hypergeometric equation has the form [formula], with [formula].

Proof. Consider a hypergeometric equation E(a,b,c) with no restrictions on the parameters a,b,c. In the first case, we may assume [formula]. Since the monodromy group is not abelian and there are no logarithmic points, the local exponent differences 1 - c,a + n,c - a + n are not integers.

In the second case, we may choose z = 0 as a logarithmic point. Then c is an integer, and we can choose it to be positive. Since there are no terminating solutions, a and b are not integers by part 1 of Theorem [\ref=dendcases].

In the third case, we choose z = 0 as a logarithmic point as well, so c is a positive integer. Terminating solutions occur if a or b is an integer. Assume that b is an integer. Then [formula] by part 4 of Theorem [\ref=dendcases], and either b  ≤  0 or c - b  ≤  0 by part 3 of the same theorem. While keeping c positive, we can permute b and c - b by part 2 of Lemma [\ref=frlints], so we may assume that b  ≤  0.

In the fourth case, we may assume a =  - n and use part 1 of Corollary [\ref=abcases], so one of the numbers 1 - b,c - a,1 + b - c is a non-positive integer - m. Due to fractional-linear transformations we may assume that c - a =  - m. We are allowed to rename b to a - m, for the purpose of symmetric presentation in Section [\ref=abelian].

In the fifth case, the numbers a,b,c are integers by part 2 of Corollary [\ref=abcases]. One of the numbers in the sequence a,b,c - a,c - b has different positivity than the others. Up to fractional-linear transformations, we may assume that [formula] is a positive integer, and a =  - n, c - a =  - m are non-positive integers.

In the last case, the numbers a,b,c are integers by part 3 of Corollary [\ref=abcases]. The four numbers in part 2 of Lemma [\ref=frlints] cannot be all negative, since their sum is zero. We may assume that a,b,c - a,c - b are all non-negative, and that c - a  ≤  b  ≤  a  ≤  0. Therefore we may set [formula], b - a =  - n and c - a - b =  - m. [formula]

Table [\ref=figtab] describes concisely the set of Kummer's solutions in each degenerate case. The case numbers refer to Theorem [\ref=dencases]. The second column gives the total number of distinct well-defined Kummer's series. In the third column, each terminating solution is represented by an additive expression, where the first integer gives the number of terminating hypergeometric expressions for the solution, and the second integer gives the number of non-terminating expressions for the same solution. The last column specifies solutions which have only non-terminating hypergeometric expressions; usually these solutions have 4 hypergeometric expressions due to Euler-Pfaff transformations. Multiple subcases are commented promptly below in the following Section. We consider only relations between the 24 Kummer's solutions, so we do not take into account quadratic or higher degree transformations, nor we consider artificial identities with terminating series like

[formula]

In particular, we consider two constant terminating [formula] series (that is, series with a zero upper parameter) as distinct if other parameters or the argument are not equal. Correctness of Table [\ref=figtab] is evident from detailed considerations in Sections [\ref=terminating] through [\ref=additive].

Some explicit facts

Here we present some formulas which are useful in the following Sections. In particular, we discuss degenerations of Euler-Pfaff transformations, and introduce an alternative normalization of Gauss hypergeometric function. Recall that Euler-Pfaff transformations [\cite=specfaar] identify the following hypergeometric series:

[formula]

These transformations hold when [formula]. If the local exponent differences c - a - b and a - b are non-zero, then these four series are distinct. Note that the four series are local series at z = 0. Recall that Kummer's series for E(a,b,c) with the argument 1 - z or 1 - 1 / z are local series at z = 1; Kummer's series with the argument 1 / z or 1 / (1 - z) are local series at z =   ∞  .

It turns out that if none of four series ([\ref=flinear1])-([\ref=flinear3]) is terminating, which means a,b, [formula], then no Kummer's series at z = 1, z =   ∞   are equal to the left-hand of ([\ref=flinear1]). To see this, one may consider a solution basis and connection formulas in the general case [\cite=bateman] and in case 2 of Table [\ref=figtab] (see Section [\ref=logarithmic] here).

We formulate a general conclusion as follows. Let F denote a Gauss hypergeometric function with the argument φ(z) as in ([\ref=p1automor]), so that φ(z) is a local parameter at a point P∈{0,1,  ∞  }. Let n(F)∈{0,1,2} denote the number of points in the set [formula] where the local exponent difference for the corresponding hypergeometric equation is equal to zero. Then we have exactly 4 - n(F) distinct hypergeometric series expressions for F, unless F can be expressed as a terminating series. Now multiple cases of Table [\ref=figtab] can be better clarified. Recall that points with the zero local exponent difference are always logarithmic. In case 2 we can have at most three logarithmic points, so we may have no singular points with the zero local exponent difference (the first line there), one such a point (the second line), or 2 or 3 such points (the third line). In case 3 we have one logarithmic point where the local exponent difference can be zero. In case 6 we have two logarithmic points.

On a few occasions we use the following normalization of Gauss hypergeometric series:

[formula]

This series is well defined when [formula]; in this case

[formula]

If [formula] and [formula], then we should take limits of the summands with singular gamma values:

[formula]

If one of the parameters a,b is a non-positive integer, but c is a smaller or equal integer, then the function in ([\ref=althpgseries]) is also well-defined if we agree to evaluate quotients of singular gamma values by taking residues there. Then we have the following formulas.

Suppose that [formula], and that n  ≤  N. Then

[formula]

Correct versions of Euler-Pfaff transformations are:

[formula]

Proof. Formula ([\ref=althpgrel]) is straightforward. For formula ([\ref=eulera]), we put b =  - n, c =  - ν - n in general Euler's formula ([\ref=flinear1]) and take the limit ν  →  N - n. For the other two formulas, we take the same specialization and the same limit in Pfaff's formulas ([\ref=flinear2])-([\ref=flinear3]). [formula]

For further convenience, we set forth the following two functions:

[formula]

In general, they form a basis of solutions for E(a,b,c). Connection formulas for other hypergeometric solutions of E(a,b,c) can be written as:

[formula]

where

[formula]

These formulas hold for analytic continuations of the [formula]-functions onto the upper half-plane, like in [\cite=bateman].

We shall use the following consequences of the reflection formula [\cite=specfaar] for the gamma function:

[formula]

Recall that ψ(x) = Γ'(x) / Γ(x).

Suppose that [formula] and [formula]. Then for |z| < 1 (and eventually, after analytic continuation) we have

[formula]

Proof. The formula follows by applying ([\ref=deuler1]) termwise. [formula]

Terminating hypergeometric series

Here we consider hypergeometric equations which have terminating hypergeometric solutions and non-abelian monodromy group, but do not have logarithmic points. We are in case 1 of Theorem [\ref=dencases]. A general equation is E( - n,a,c), where n is a non-negative integer, and a,c,c - a are not integers. All 24 Kummer's solutions are well defined. The monodromy group of this equation is reducible, because a terminating hypergeometric solution spans an invariant subspace.

It turns out that there are terminating hypergeometric solutions at each singular point of E( - n,a,c). All terminating solutions lie in the one-dimensional invariant subspace. Here is their identification:

[formula]

These formulas can be proved using the following two transformations a few times: rewriting a terminating hypergeometric sum in the opposite direction, and Pfaff's formula ([\ref=flinear2]). Application of Euler's formula ([\ref=flinear1]) to the above series gives non-terminating hypergeometric expressions for the same function. We have 6 terminating and 6 non-terminating hypergeometric expressions for this solution.

The six expressions ([\ref=termseries1])-([\ref=termseries6]) are valid for any terminating Gauss hypergeometric series, if only the numbers a, c, c - a are not integers in the interval

[formula]

General logarithmic solutions

Here we consider hypergeometric equations which have logarithmic points, but do not have terminating hypergeometric solutions. We are in case 2 of Theorem [\ref=dencases]. A general hypergeometric equation of this kind is E(a,b,m + 1), where m is a non-negative integer, and a,b are not integers.

The functions H1, H2 in ([\ref=localat0]) coincide in this case. The corresponding [formula] series either coincide (if m = 0), or only one of them is well-defined (if m  ≥  1). Formulas for a second independent local solution at z = 0 are not pretty, but it must be important to have them. We choose to identify logarithmic solutions with

[formula]

The function U1 has the following expressions:

[formula]

Proof. Formulas ([\ref=logsol3]) and ([\ref=u1ab]) are special cases of connection formulas 2.9.(33) and 2.9.(25) in [\cite=bateman], respectively.

To prove formula ([\ref=logsol1]), we apply formula ([\ref=altform1]) to the equation E(a,b,m + 1) and use expression ([\ref=logsol2]). We take the limit c  →  m + 1 on the right-hand of ([\ref=altform1]) by l'Hospital's rule and arrive at

[formula]

The first m terms of the second and of the third series are zero. The second series becomes the first term of ([\ref=logsol1]). To compute the first m terms of the fourth series, we set x = 2 - c + k in formula ([\ref=deuler2]) and get

[formula]

The first m terms of the fourth series in ([\ref=askroy]) form the second term of formula ([\ref=logsol1]). The last term in ([\ref=logsol1]) is obtained by combining the remaining terms of the third and fourth series in ([\ref=askroy]), and all terms of the first series in ([\ref=askroy]). This proof of ([\ref=logsol1]) follows closely the derivation in [\cite=specfaar]; there are a few misprints in formulas there.

To prove ([\ref=logsol3a]), we express the first term in ([\ref=logsol3]) as a logarithmic function using ([\ref=logsol1]). Then we simplify the term with log z by Euler's formula.

To prove ([\ref=u1ab2]), we apply Pfaff's transformation to the first term of ([\ref=u1ab]) and substitution z  ↦  z / (z - 1) in ([\ref=logsol2]) and ([\ref=logsol1]). Then we simplify the logarithmic term by Pfaff's formula, observing that (for [formula] in the upper half-plane)

[formula]

More expressions for U1 can be obtained by interchanging a, b in ([\ref=u1ab]) and ([\ref=u1ab2]), by applying Euler-Pfaff transformations to individual hypergeometric functions in ([\ref=logsol2])-([\ref=u1ab2]), and by applying Lemma [\ref=psitransf] to sums with the ψ-function. In this way logarithmic solutions at z = 0 can be related to any other well-defined hypergeometric series at z = 1 or z =   ∞  . One may check that well-defined hypergeometric series at different points are independent.

The points z = 1 and z =   ∞   are not logarithmic if and only if [formula]. We have either 4 undefined Kummer's series at z = 0 (if m > 0) or 4 pairs of coinciding hypergeometric series there (if m = 0). In the latter case, Euler's transformation ([\ref=flinear1]) acts trivially on some hypergeometric series at z = 1 and z =   ∞  , for example on ([\ref=logsol2]). Then we have 3 (rather than usual 4) distinct hypergeometric expressions for each Gauss hypergeometric function representable by well-defined series at z = 1 and z =   ∞  . In any case (when z = 1, z =   ∞   are not logarithmic), we have 5 different Gauss hypergeometric solutions represented by 16 or 20 distinct Kummer's series.

If either a + b or a - b is an integer, then the equation E(a,b,m + 1) has one other logarithmic point. For example, if [formula] and [formula] then the point z =   ∞   is logarithmic. A power series solution there is

[formula]

Just as we obtained solution ([\ref=logsol1]) from coinciding solutions H1 = H2 in ([\ref=althpgseries]) with c = m + 1, we have the following local solution at z =   ∞  :

[formula]

This function has to be identified with the following constant multiple of U1:

[formula]

To see this, use connection formula [\cite=bateman] before taking the limit [formula] in the analogue of ([\ref=altform1]). If m  ≠  0 and [formula], then 8 Kummer's series are undefined; other 16 Kummer's series are distinct and represent 4 different Gauss hypergeometric functions. If m  ≠  0, [formula], then 4 Kummer's series at z = 0 are undefined, and there are 4 coinciding pairs of them at z =   ∞  . Other 4 Kummer's series at z =   ∞   are distinct expressions of one Gauss hypergeometric function. There are 3 more Gauss hypergeometric solutions, each represented by 3 distinct Kummer's series at z = 0 or z = 1. If m = 0, [formula], we have a similar situation. If [formula], then there are 3 distinct Kummer's series at z = 0 and at z =   ∞  , and 4 distinct series at z = 1. The series at z = 0 or at z =   ∞   represent a single Gauss hypergeometric function; the series at z = 1 represent two different functions.

All three singular points of E(a,b,m + 1) are logarithmic if and only if a and b are rational numbers with the denominator 2. Then we have 3 distinct Gauss hypergeometric functions, one for each singular point. The number of their hypergeometric expressions depends on the presence of singular points with the zero local exponent difference; recall discussion of Table [\ref=figtab]. If all three local exponent differences are 0, then each Gauss hypergeometric solution is represented by just two distinct Kummer's series. In this case the equation is E(1 / 2,1 / 2,1); its hypergeometric solutions are related to the well-known complete elliptic integral K(k); see [\cite=specfaar]. Other renowned complete elliptic integral is E(k) [\cite=specfaar], which is expressible via solutions of E( - 1 / 2,1 / 2,1). This equation has one local exponent difference equal to 0, so the number of distinct Kummer's series is 10. An example of hypergeometric equation with 13 distinct Kummer's series is E( - 1 / 2, - 1 / 2,1); it has two local exponent differences equal to 0.

Logarithmic and terminating solutions

Here we consider hypergeometric equations which have logarithmic points and terminating hypergeometric solutions, but the monodromy group is non-abelian. By part 3 of Theorem [\ref=dencases], a general hypergeometric equation of this kind is E(a, - n,m + 1), where [formula] and [formula]. We are in the non-abelian case of part 3 of Theorem [\ref=dendcases]. The point z = 0 is logarithmic; the points z = 1, z =   ∞   are not logarithmic.

The terminating solution [formula] has 6 terminating expressions ([\ref=termseries1])-([\ref=termseries6]) with n + 1 terms, but there are 2 extra terminating expressions with m + n + 1 terms if m  ≠  0:

[formula]

This solution has 4 non-terminating hypergeometric expressions with the argument z, z / (z - 1), 1 / z or 1 - 1 / z, due to Euler's formula ([\ref=flinear1]). There are 2 other Gauss hypergeometric solutions, represented by 6 (if m > 0) or 8 (if m = 0) distinct non-terminating Kummer's series at z = 1 and z =   ∞  . Like in Section [\ref=logarithmic], we miss 4 Kummer's series at z = 0, which are either undefined or coincide with listed terminating series.

The logarithmic solution U1 of Section [\ref=logarithmic] is not defined in this case, since some values of the ψ-function become infinite in formulas ([\ref=logsol2])-([\ref=u1ab2]). We should either apply those formulas to the equation E(m + 1 - a,m + n + 1,m + 1), or consider the following solution of E(a, - n,m + 1), well defined for b =  - n by expression ([\ref=logsol3a]):

[formula]

The following Theorem presents various expressions for this function.

The function U2 with b =  - n has the following expressions:

[formula]

Proof. To show the first two formulas we apply, respectively, ([\ref=logsol3]) or ([\ref=u1ab]) to expression ([\ref=u2exp0]). Then we collect the two terms with [formula] and take the limit b  →   - n.

To prove ([\ref=u2exp3]), we apply Lemma [\ref=psitransf] to expression ([\ref=logsol1]) and arrive at

[formula]

Now we take the limit b  →   - n of each term. In particular, for k  ≥  n + 1 we apply formula ([\ref=deuler1]) with x = b + k, and then formula ([\ref=deuler2]) to get

[formula]

Note that the last sum in ([\ref=u2exp3]) can be easily missed out; see [\cite=specfaar].

Formulas ([\ref=u2exp4]), ([\ref=u2exp5]) are direct consequences of and ([\ref=logsol3a]), ([\ref=u1ab2]) applied to ([\ref=u2exp0]). To get formula ([\ref=u2exp6]), consider ([\ref=u1ab2]) with interchanged roles of the parameters a and b, so that a approaches the integer - n (and b can be renamed to a at some point). Then we apply Lemma [\ref=psitransf] similarly as in the proof of ([\ref=u2exp3]). [formula]

Completely reducible monodromy group

Here we consider hypergeometric equations with completely reducible but non-trivial monodromy group. Up to conjugation, the monodromy representation is a subgroup of [formula]. By part 4 of Theorem [\ref=dencases], a general hypergeometric equation of this type is E( - n,a - m, - n - m), where n,m are non-negative integers, and [formula].

Since the monodromy group is completely reducible, there is a basis of terminating solutions of E( - n,a - m, - n - m). Such a basis is

[formula]

Although these two hypergeometric series seem to be equal by standard Euler's formula ([\ref=flinear1]), the correct Euler's transformation in this situation is formula ([\ref=eulera]) of Lemma [\ref=f21ff]. Alternative terminating expressions of the basis solutions ([\ref=abbasis]) are obtained by using formulas ([\ref=termseries1])-([\ref=termseries6]). For example,

[formula]

For the last four expressions, standard Euler's formula ([\ref=flinear1]) can be applied; this gives us 4 non-terminating hypergeometric expressions. In total we have 6 terminating and 4 non-terminating hypergeometric expressions for each basis solution in ([\ref=abbasis]). The remaining 4 Kummer's solutions are related by Euler-Pfaff transformations; they represent one Gauss hypergeometric function. The relation between this non-terminating and the two terminating solutions is a consequence of formula ([\ref=althpgrel]) in Lemma [\ref=f21ff]:

The trivial monodromy group

Here we consider hypergeometric equations with the trivial monodromy group. That means that solutions can be meromorphically continued to the entire projective line [formula], so they are rational functions. By part 5 of Theorem [\ref=dencases], general hypergeometric equation with trivial monodromy group is [formula]. We have the following three terminating solutions:

[formula]

Each of them can be transformed by formulas ([\ref=termseries1])-([\ref=termseries6]). For example,

[formula]

Note how permutation of the numbers [formula] permutes the three sets of hypergeometric representations for solutions in ([\ref=threesols]), if we ignore the front factors and change of the argument. The last two identities can be transformed to non-terminating series by Euler's formula, so in total we have 6 terminating and 2 non-terminating hypergeometric expressions for each of the three solutions. This exhausts the 24 Kummer's series. Relation between the three solutions is a consequence of ([\ref=abnonterm]):

Additive monodromy group

Here we consider hypergeometric equations whose monodromy group is (up to conjugation) a non-trivial subgroup of [formula]. By part 6 of Theorem [\ref=dencases], general hypergeometric equation of this type is [formula]. The point z = 0 is not a logarithmic point for this equation, there is a basis of power series solutions there:

[formula]

The first solution has the following terminating expressions:

[formula]

where

[formula]

This solution has also non-terminating hypergeometric expressions, with the argument 1 - z or 1 / (1 - z) by Euler's formula. In total we have 10 terminating and 2 non-terminating hypergeometric expressions for this solution. The number of distinct terminating expressions may drop to 8 (if m = 0 or n = 0) or to 6 (if m = n = 0). The second solution in ([\ref=additivbasis]) has 2, 3 or 4 distinct hypergeometric expressions due to Euler-Pfaff transformations.

Other Kummer's series at z = 1 and z =   ∞   are undefined (or coincide with terminating expressions, if m = 0 or n = 0). Consequently, there is no basis of power series solutions at these points z = 1, z =   ∞  ; they are logarithmic. In the following Theorem, we present logarithmic expressions for the function

[formula]

Notice that all terms with the ψ-function can be written as terminating sums of rational numbers, and that all sums in expression ([\ref=u3exp1]) are terminating.

Set [formula]. The following formulas hold:

[formula]

Besides, in each expression one can interchange m and n, provided that z is replaced by z / (z - 1) and the whole expression is multiplied by [formula].

Proof. To derive the formulas, we consider the equation [formula] in the context of Theorem [\ref=logtermt]. Then we have [formula]. In formula ([\ref=u2exp3]), we get rid of the singular ψ-values and the tangent term by using Lemma [\ref=psitransf]. The result is:

[formula]

We apply Euler's transformation ([\ref=flinear1]) to the first hypergeometric sum, rewrite the last sum in the opposite direction, and get ([\ref=u3exp1]). Formulas ([\ref=u3exp2]) and ([\ref=u3exp3]) are just rewritten expressions ([\ref=u2exp4]) and ([\ref=u2exp6]), respectively. Formula ([\ref=u3exp4]) can be obtained from ([\ref=u2exp6]) after interchanging the first two parameters of [formula]; the same formula can be obtained by carefully applying Lemma [\ref=psitransf] to expression ([\ref=u2exp5]).

To see the last statement, one can check the described transformation on formula ([\ref=u3exp0]) and compare it with Pfaff's transformation. (Formula ([\ref=u3exp1]) is invariant under this transformation as well, up to Euler's transformation of the first term and summing the second term in the opposite direction. Interchanging the singular points z = 1, z =   ∞   produces the same transformation.) [formula]
