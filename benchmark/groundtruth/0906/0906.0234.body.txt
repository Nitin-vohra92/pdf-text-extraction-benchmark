Suzaku and Multi-wavelength Observations of OJ 287 during the Periodic Optical Outburst in 2007

Introduction

At a redshift of z  =  0.306 [\citep=Stickel], OJ 287 is one of the archetypal and most studied blazars. An outstanding characteristic of the object is its recurrent optical outbursts with a period of 11.65 years, as revealed by optical data spanning more than 100 years [\citep=SMBH]. The outburst in 1994 motivated a worldwide multi-wavelength observation campaign named "The OJ 94 project" [\citep=OJ94]. This project confirmed the periodicity and revealed that the optical outbursts consist of two peaks corresponding to flares with an interval of about one year [\citep=double_peak]. OJ 287 is suggested to be a binary black hole system in which a secondary black hole pierces the accretion disk of the primary black hole and produces two impact flushes per period [\citep=Valtonen_nature]. Interestingly, the first flare exhibited a low radio flux with decreasing radio polarization and a relatively short duration (a few months), while the second one had a high radio flux with increasing radio polarization, and lasted about half a year [\citep=double_peak] [\citep=disk-jet] [\citep=Pursimo]. The differences between the two flares may be interpreted as the first flare have a thermal origin in the vicinity of the black hole and the accretion disk, while the second one originate from synchrotron radiation from the jet [\citep=disk-jet], although we have not yet obtained any convincing evidence supporting this interpretation.

The multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution (SED) has the potential to resolve the physical state of OJ 287 during the flares. In general, the SED of blazars is characterized by two broad humps (e.g., [\cite=Fos98]); the low-energy component, with wavelengths in the range between radio to ultraviolet and X-ray, is widely regarded as synchrotron radiation (SR) from relativistic electrons within the jet. The high-energy component, with wavelengths in the range between X-rays and γ-rays, is interpreted as inverse-Compton (IC) scattering. In one of the simple emission models, named "synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model", relativistic electrons scatter SR photons produced by the same population of electrons (e.g., [\cite=Ghi98]). For low-frequency peaked BL Lac objects (LBLs), a class of blazars to which OJ 287 belongs, the SR peak is located in the range between sub-mm and optical wavelengths [\citep=Pad95]. IC scattering in LBLs can emit radiation up to very-high-energy (VHE: E>  50 GeV) γ-rays during their optical high states; VHE γ-ray emission has been detected, for example, from BL Lacertae [\citep=BLLac] and S5 0716+714 [\citep=Tes08]. These two components usually intersect with each other in the X-ray band (e.g., [\cite=S50716]). Therefore, the X-ray spectrum of LBLs should be highly sensitive to the change of the magnetic field (B) and/or the maximum Lorentz factor (γ max) of the electrons, since the SR peak scales as [formula]. In fact, the X-ray spectrum of the object, obtained in previous observations, can be successfully interpreted on the basis of the interplay between the SR and the IC component [\citep=Idesawa] [\citep=Isobe]. However, all of these X-ray observations were carried out during the first flare, and there is no information regarding the X-ray spectrum of OJ 287 in the second flare.

In the period between 2005 and 2008, OJ 287 was predicted to move to the last active phase, and was in fact reported to exhibit the first optical outburst in 2005 November [\citep=Valtonen_nature] [\citep=OJ287_2005_2]. Since the second flare of the source was expected to be in the fall of 2007 ([\cite=Valtonen2] [\cite=Kidger]), we organized two X-ray and simultaneous multi-wavelength observations, in the quiescent state (MWL I) between the two outbursts and in the second flaring state (MWL II), with the objective to reveal the characteristics of the second flare, in comparison with the quiescent state. Based on the results, we provide a discussion regarding the differences between the first and the second flare. The Suzaku X-ray observation in MWL I was conducted during 2007 April 10 - 13, when the source was optically quiescent with an R-band magnitude of about 15. We triggered the MWL II Suzaku observation in 2007 November 7, on condition that the object remained brighter than 14-th magnitude for more than one week, as indicated by the optical monitoring data of the source taken at the Tuorla Observatory and the KVA observatory . We also conducted monitoring observations at radio, optical, and VHE γ-ray frequencies with the Nobeyama Millimeter Array (NMA), the KANATA telescope, and the MAGIC telescope, respectively.

The X-ray observations and the spectral results are presented in section 2. section 3 shows the radio, optical, and VHE γ-ray results. These are followed by the discussion on the physical state of the second flare in section 4 on the basis of SED obtained in these multi-frequency observations.

X-ray Observations and Results

Observations and data reduction

The Suzaku pointing observation for MWL I was conducted between 19:47:00 UT 2007 April 10 and 11:10:19 UT April 13 (ObsID 702009010), and the pointing for MWL II was conducted between 11:24:00 UT 2007 November 7 and 21:30:23 November 9 (ObsID 702008010). The X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (XIS; [\cite=Koyama]) and the Hard X-ray Detector (HXD; [\cite=Takahashi]; [\cite=Kokubun]) onboard Suzaku were operated in the normal clocking mode with no window option, and in the normal mode, respectively.

We placed OJ 287 at the HXD-nominal position [\citep=Serlemitosos]. We performed data reduction by using the HEADAS 6.5.1 software package and referring to the calibration data base (CALDB) of the XIS, the X-ray telescope (XRT; [\cite=Serlemitosos]), and the HXD as of 2008 September 5, 2008 July 9, and 2008 August 11, respectively.

We reprocessed the XIS data in MWL I since the version of the standard processing (Revision 2.0.6.13) was obsolete, whereas we utilized the pipeline cleaned events from the Revision 2.1.6.16 processing for MWL II. The reprocessed/cleaned XIS data were filtered under the following criteria; the spacecraft is outside the south Atlantic anomaly (SAA), the time interval after an exit from the SAA is longer than 436 s, the geomagnetic cutoff rigidity (COR) is higher than 6 GV, the source elevation above the rim of bright and night Earth (ELV) is higher than and , respectively, and the XIS data are free from telemetry saturation. These procedures yielded 85.3 ks and 102.6 ks of good exposures, for MWL I and MWL II. In the scientific analysis below, we utilize only the events with grades of 0, 2, 3, 4, or 6.

We reprocessed the HXD data in both observations by using the latest gain file in the CALDB. The HXD data were screened under the following criteria; the time interval before and after the SAA is longer than 180 s and 500 s, COR and ELV are higher than 6 GV and , respectively. As a result, we obtained 93.6 ks and 102.9 ks of good exposures, for MWL I and MWL II.

XIS Results

Figure [\ref=fig:xis_image] shows the 0.5 - 10 keV XIS images in MWL I and MWL II. OJ 287 was clearly detected at the position of (α,δ) = (, ) in J2000.0 coordinates, with no other apparent contaminating source within the XIS field of view. The image indicates that the intensity of the source was higher in MWL II than in MWL I. We accumulated the source signals within the solid circles with a radius of in figure [\ref=fig:xis_image]. The background events were integrated within the same radius (dashed circles) at symmetric positions around the optical axis of the XRT.

In figure [\ref=fig:XIS_lc], we show the background-subtracted X-ray lightcurves of OJ 287 in MWL I and MWL II. The data from the two front-illuminated (FI) CCD cameras (XIS 0 and 3; [\cite=Koyama]) were co-added. In MWL I, the time-averaged count rates in the soft (0.5 - 2 keV) and medium (2 - 10 keV) bands were measured to be 0.088  ±  0.001 cts s- 1 and 0.071  ±  0.001 cts s- 1, respectively, while they nearly doubled to 0.166  ±  0.001 cts s- 1 and 0.164  ±  0.002 cts s- 1 in MWL II. With χ2  =  42.9 and 27.7 for 39 degrees of freedom (d.o.f.), the lightcurve indicates no significant variation during MWL I in either energy band. On the other hand, in MWL II, we found that the source flux gradually decreased by a factor of 1.3 in the first half of the observation (~  1.5 days; χ2  /  d.o.f.  =  58.5 / 37 and 71.3 / 37 in the soft and medium bands). However, the hardness ratio, which was simply calculated by dividing the count rate of the medium band by that of the soft band, indicates no significant spectral variation in either observation. Therefore, we evaluated the averaged spectra as presented below.

Figure [\ref=fig:XIS_spec] shows the background-subtracted XIS spectra of OJ 287, without removing the instrumental response. In this case, significant X-ray signals were detected in the range of 0.5 - 10 keV and 0.4 - 8 keV, with the FI CCDs and the backside-illuminated (BI) CCD (XIS 1). The spectra appear to be featureless, without any absorption or emission lines.

We fitted the spectra with a single power-law (PL) model modified for photoelectric absorption and subsequently calculated the response matrix function and the auxiliary response file by using xisrmfgen and xissimarfgen [\citep=Ishisaki], respectively. The effects of absorption caused by the presence of contaminants on the surface of the optical blocking filter of the CCD is taken into account in xissimarfgen. The FI and BI spectra were jointly fitted by allowing deviations between their respective model normalizations. Because we found that the fluxes from the BI and FI spectra were in good agreement within 7 %, we adopt the FI value in the present paper. We fixed the absorption column density at the Galactic value (NH  =  2.56  ×  1020 cm- 2; [\cite=Kalberla]). The PL model became acceptable, yielding the best-fit photon index of Γ  =  1.65  ±  0.02 and Γ  =  1.50  ±  0.01 for MWL I and MWL II, respectively. Thus, we found that OJ 287 showed a harder X-ray spectrum in MWL II. As indicated in the lightcurve (figure [\ref=fig:XIS_lc]), the flux density of the source in MWL II (404+ 6- 5 nJy) was higher than that in MWL I (215  ±  5 nJy) by a factor of 2.

HXD-PIN Results

It is crucial to evaluate the non-X-ray background (NXB), before examining the hard X-ray spectrum observed with the HXD-PIN ([\cite=Takahashi]; [\cite=Kokubun]). Although the NXB varies under various cosmic ray environments in the orbit, the HXD team revealed a set of control parameters for reproducing the NXB and supplied simulated NXB event files for each observation. The latest version of the NXB model, named "tuned"-NXB (LCFITDT in [\cite=Fukazawa]), was reported to have a systematic reproducibility error of 2.31 % and of 0.99 % with 10 ks and 40 ks exposures, respectively, in the 15 - 40 keV band.

First, we analyzed the HXD-PIN data in MWL I. Since the data during Earth occultation is essentially dominated by the NXB events, these data allow for the reproducibility of the NXB model to be evaluated. The data were obtained with the same criteria as in the case of the on-source observation (section [\ref=sec:reduction]), with the exception that ELV <   instead of ELV >   . The exposure of 44.1 ks was attained under these conditions. Figure [\ref=fig:PIN_qui] (a) compares the observed Earth-occultated (black), the NXB model (red), and the NXB-subtracted (green) spectra. Table [\ref=table:HXD_log_MWLI] summarizes the statistics of the data and the NXB model in MWL I. We found a data excess of 3.8  ±  1.0 ~ % over the NXB model below 20 keV. The apparent excess below 20 keV is within a 3 ~ σ level of the current uncertainty of the NXB model ([\cite=Fukazawa]). Therefore, we consider that the excess is an artifact produced by fluctuations in the NXB model. In other words, the NXB model underestimates the real NXB data with ~  4 % in this observation. It is necessary to take this into account for the on-source data.

In a similar manner, we compared the on-source and NXB model spectra, and the results are shown in figure [\ref=fig:PIN_qui] (b). We found a significant data excess over the NXB model, in the 12 - 40 keV range. This excess includes not only the source signals, but also those of the cosmic X-ray background (CXB). In order to evaluate the CXB component, we introduced the CXB spectrum within the HXD field of view as in accordance to [\citet=bolt]. We folded this spectrum with the HXD-PIN response of ae_hxd_pinhxnome3_20080129.rsp which was appropriate to the observation phase (Epoch 3), and show it in figure [\ref=fig:PIN_qui] (b). We also summarized the statistics of the data, the NXB, and the CXB in table [\ref=table:HXD_log_MWLII]. The NXB count rate for on-source is higher than that for the Earth occultation, due to different orbit conditions of the satellite, as can be seen in tables [\ref=table:HXD_log_MWLI] and [\ref=table:HXD_log_MWLII]. Therefore, it is of no use to perform a direct comparison of the count rates between the Earth occultation and on-source periods, and therefore we examined the ratio of the combined NXB and CXB to the NXB. After subtracting the CXB and NXB models, the on-source data corresponded to 4.2 ±   0.3 % and - 0.9  ±  0.2 % of the NXB, in 12 - 20 keV and 20 - 40 keV, respectively. By using the Earth occultation data, we ascribed the apparent excess in 12 - 20 keV due to the uncertainly of the NXB model instead of the source signals since we confirmed that the NXB model underestimates the real NXB spectrum by ~  4 %.

Next, in (a) in figure [\ref=fig:PIN_flare], we show the HXD-PIN spectra of MWL II during the Earth occultation with an exposure of 28.7 ks. Table [\ref=table:HXD_log_MWLII] summarizes the statistics of the data and the NXB model during the Earth occultation. They are consistent with each other within 1.4  ±  1.2% and 1.2  ±  1.6% in 12 - 20 keV and 20 - 40 keV. Thus, we confirmed that the NXB model adequately reproduced the observed NXB spectrum in MWL II within its reported uncertainty.

Figure [\ref=fig:PIN_flare] (b) shows the on-source spectra in MWL II. In order to fold the CXB spectra, we used the HXD-PIN response function (Epoch 4), ae_hxd_pinhxnome4_20080129.rsp. The HXD-PIN spectrum revealed a significant excess over the combined CXB and NXB in the 12 - 27 keV range. The count rates for the data, the NXB and the CXB in this range, are shown in table [\ref=table:HXD_log_MWLII]. Thus, the excess has a count rate of 0.011  ±  0.002 cts s- 1 (2.9  ±  0.6 % of the NXB), which corresponds to statistical significance of 5.0σ. Since this is well above the NXB errors, we concluded that the HXD-PIN detected signals from OJ 287 in MWL II.

Due to the rather low signal statistics of the HXD-PIN in comparison to the XIS, instead of joint fitting of XIS and HXD-PIN spectra, we compared the flux of the HXD-PIN signal to the fitting result of the XIS spectrum. The simple extrapolation of the best-fit single PL model to the XIS spectrum (section [\ref=sec:XIS]) has a count rate of 0.016 cts s- 1 in 12 - 27 keV, after the correction of the relative normalization of the HXD to the XIS (1.14: [\cite=XIS2HXD]). The detected HXD-PIN count rate is only 0.65 times this value, which suggests the presence of a spectral break between the XIS and the HXD-PIN range, although it is statistically insignificant (2.6 σ).

Multi-wavelength Observations and Results

Radio Observations

Eleven radio observations of OJ 287 with the NMA at the Nobeyama Radio Observatory were carried out between January 2007 and January 2008. The NMA consists of six 10-m antennas equipped with cooled DSB SIS receivers. An Ultra-Wide-Band Correlator [\citep=Okumura] was employed as the spectrocorrelator. We performed simultaneous observations of a radio continuum emission from OJ 287 at 86.75 GHz and 98.75 GHz, with a 1 GHz bandwidth for each band. The total on-source time of OJ 287 in each observation was between nine and twelve minutes. In each observation session, OJ 287 and the bright reference amplitude calibrators (3C 84 or 3C 345) were observed alternately. The relative amplitude ratios between OJ 287 and these reference calibrators were obtained from the visibility data. As absolute flux-scale calibrations, Uranus or Neptune was used in order to calculate the final flux values of OJ 287. The uncertainties in the absolute flux scale were estimated to be about 15 % for each observation, taking into account statistical errors induced by noise and systematic errors caused by flux fluctuations of the reference calibrators.

For MWL I, we observed the source on 11 and 12 April, overlapping with the Suzaku pointing. The averaged flux of the two night observations was 1.73  ±  0.26 Jy and 1.75  ±  0.26 Jy at 86.75 GHz and 98.75 GHz, respectively. During the period of MWL II, the observations on November 7 and 8 were coincident with the Suzaku pointing. The averaged flux of the two day observations was 3.04  ±  0.46 Jy and 2.98  ±  0.45 Jy at 86.75 GHz and 98.75 GHz, respectively (see table [\ref=table:radio_opt_log]). The measured radio flux for MWL II was 1.7 - 1.8 times higher than that for MWL I.

Optical Observations

Optical and near-infrared (NIR) photometric observations were performed at the Higashi-Hiroshima Observatory with the 1.5-m "KANATA" telescope. We obtained images of the field of OJ 287 with V, J, and Ks filters by using TRISPEC attached to the telescope [\citep=Watanabe]. The V-band images were observed for 53 nights between 2006 October and 2007 December. For each night, we obtained ~  20 images with an exposure time of 108 s for each frame. The magnitude of OJ 287 was measured by differential photometry with a neighbor comparison star located at (α,δ) = (, ). The V-magnitude of the comparison star (V = 14.160) was quoted from [\citet=Skiff]. After preparing dark-subtracted and flat-fielded images, we measured the magnitudes of the objects by using the aperture photometry package in IRAF. We also checked the constancy of the comparison star by using a neighbor star at (α,δ) = (, ). The differential magnitude of the comparison star exhibited no significant fluctuation exceeding 0.003-th during our observations.

We also obtained NIR images, for MWL I on 2007 April 11, 12, and 13, as well as for MWL II on November 7, 8, and 10, which overlapped with the Suzaku pointing. Simultaneous V, J, and Ks-band images are available for these six nights. The exposure times of each frame were 15 and 4 s for the J and Ks-band images, respectively. The reduction procedure was similar to that in the V-band data mentioned above, and we used the same comparison stars and target stars as those for the V-band data. The J and Ks magnitudes of the comparison star were quoted from the 2MASS catalog (J = 12.664 and Ks = 12.090; [\cite=Skrutskie]). We confirmed that the magnitude of the comparison star remained constant within 0.004 and 0.012-th for J and Ks-bands during our observations. In MWL I, the averaged flux of three night observations was 3.03  ±  0.01 mJy, 8.81  ±  0.03 mJy, and 17.74  ±  0.33 mJy for V, J, Ks-band, respectively. In MWL II, these fluxes were 8.93  ±  0.05 mJy, 27.02  ±  0.21 mJy, and 55.95+ 7.96- 6.76 mJy, respectively. (see table [\ref=table:radio_opt_log]). It can be seen that the source flux for MWL II is higher by a factor 3 as compared to that for MWL I. The optical data show a monotonous decrease in a time scale of ~   4 days during MWL II by a factor of 1.3.

In addition, we obtained R-band frames from the KVA Telescope simultaneously with Suzaku pointings. The exposure time was 180 s for each frame. Photometric measurements were conducted in differential mode, that is, by obtaining CCD images of the target and the calibrated comparison stars in the same field of view ([\cite=F_and_T]). The magnitudes of the source and the comparison stars were measured using aperture photometry and the (color-corrected) zero point of the image as determined from the magnitude of the comparison star. Finally, the object magnitude was computed using the zero point and a filter-dependent color correction. After this, magnitudes were transferred into linear fluxes by using the formula F  =  F0  ×  10(mag /  - 2.5), where mag is the magnitude of the object and F0 is a filter-dependent zero point (the value F0 = 3080 Jy is used in the R-band, [\cite=Bessell]).

VHE γ-ray Observations

We used the MAGIC telescope to search for VHE γ-rays emission from OJ 287 during the MWL campaigns I and II. MAGIC is a single dish Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope (IACT) with a 17-m diameter main reflector. The telescope is located in the Canary Island of La Palma, in regular operation since 2004 with a low energy threshold of 50 - 60 GeV (trigger threshold at small zenith angles; [\cite=MAGICCrab]).

In MWL I, MAGIC observed during 3 nights. The zenith angle of the observations ranges from [formula] to [formula]. The observations were performed in so-called ON-OFF observation mode. The telescope was pointing directly to the source, recording ON-data. The background was estimated from additional observations of regions where no γ-ray is expected, OFF-data, which were taken with sky conditions similar to ON-data. Data runs with anomalous trigger rates due to bad observation conditions were rejected from the analysis. The remaining data correspond to 4.5 hours of ON and 6.5 hours of OFF data. In November and December 2007 for MWL II, MAGIC observed in a zenith angle range from [formula] to [formula] in the "wobble mode" [\citep=wobble], where the object was observed at [formula] offset from the camera center. With this observation mode, an ON-data sample and OFF-data samples can be extracted from the same observation run; in our case, we used 3 OFF regions to estimate the background. In total, the data were taken during 22 nights, two of which coincide with the Suzaku pointing. 41.2 hours of data from 19 nights passed the quality selection to be used for further analysis.

The VHE γ-ray data taken for MWLs I and II were analyzed using the MAGIC standard calibration and analysis software. Detailed information about the analysis chain is found in [\citet=MAGICCrab]. In February 2007, the signal digitization of MAGIC was upgraded to 2 [formula] FADCs, and timing information is used to suppress the contamination of light of the night sky and to obtain new shower image parameters [\citep=MAGICtime] in addition to conventional Hillas image parameters [\citep=Hillas].

These parameters were used for γ/hadron separation by means of the "Random Forest (RF)" method [\citep=MAGICRF]. The γ/hadron separation based on the RF method was turned to give a γ-cut efficiency of 70 ~ %. Finally, the γ-ray signal was determined by comparing between ON and normalized-OFF data in the |ALPHA| parameter distribution, in which the γ-ray signal should show up as an excess at small values. Our analysis requires a γ-cut efficiency of 80 ~ % for the final |ALPHA| selection. The energy of the γ-ray events are also estimated using the RF method.

A search of VHE γ-rays from OJ 287 was performed with data taken for MWLs I and II in three distinct energy bins. No significant excess was found in any data samples. Upper limits with 95 ~ % confidence level in the number of excess events were calculated using the method of [\citet=Rolke], taking into account a systematic error of 30 %. The number of excess events was converted into flux upper limits assuming a photon index of -  2.6, corresponding to the value used in our Monte-Carlo samples of γ-rays. The derived upper limits in the three energy bins for each period are summarized in table [\ref=table:UL_log].

A search for VHE flares with a short-time scale was also performed with the data taken for MWL II. Figure [\ref=fig:magic_LC] shows the nightly count rate of the excess events after all cuts including a SIZE cut above 200 photoelectrons, corresponding to an energy threshold of 150 GeV. Fitting a constant rate to the observed flux yields χ2  /  d.o.f.  =  25.55 / 18 (a probability of 11 ~ %), and thus indicates no evidence of a VHE flare during this period.

Discussion

We performed Suzaku X-ray observations of OJ 287 in the quiescent state (MWL I) and the second flare (MWL II) in 2007 April and November, respectively, where the latter was the first X-ray observation during the second flare of the source. In cooperation with Suzaku, radio, optical, and VHE γ-ray observations were performed with NMA, KANATA, and MAGIC, respectively. Figure [\ref=fig:multi_lc] summarizes the multi-wavelength lightcurves obtained between September 2006 and January 2008. While the optical flux of OJ 287 was below 3 ~  in the V-band before MWL I, the brightness of the source started increasing after MWL I to become the flaring state ([formula] mJy) in September 2007. Although the radio flux gradually decreased around the period of MWL I, it started increasing during the optical flare in MWL II, and it also increased in other energy bands. We found that the brightness of the source increased by a factor of 2 - 3, in the radio, optical, and X-ray bands between MWL I and MWL II, although no significant VHE γ-ray signals were detected in either MWL I or MWL II.

As shown in figure [\ref=fig:XIS_spec], significant X-ray signals were detected with the XIS in the range 0.5 - 10 keV range. The HXD-PIN detected hard X-ray signals in 12 - 27 keV with a significance of 5.0 ~ σ in MWL II (figure [\ref=fig:PIN_flare]), while those signals were not significant in MWL I (figure [\ref=fig:PIN_qui]). The XIS spectra in 0.5 - 10 keV were described with a single PL model modified with Galactic absorption in MWL I and MWL II. The photon indices and the flux densities at 1 keV were derived as 1.65  ±  0.02 and 215  ±  5 nJy in MWL I, and 1.50  ±  0.01 and 404+ 6- 5 nJy in MWL II.

In the previous observations of the first flares and quiescent states, the X-ray flux densities at 1 keV and photon indices of OJ 287 were estimated as 0.15 - 0.31 μJy and 1.45 - 1.63, respectively, in 1997 - 2001 with BeppoSAX [\citep=BeppoSAX], 0.22 - 0.25 μJy and 1.51 - 1.57 in 1997 with ASCA [\citep=Isobe], 0.76 + 0.03- 0.06  ~  μJy and 1.67 ±   0.02 in 1994 with ASCA [\citep=Idesawa], 2.08 - 2.24 μJy and 2.16 - 2.37 in 1983 - 1984 with EXOSAT [\citep=EXOSAT], and 0.94 - 2.70 μJy and 1.5 - 2.3 in 1979 - 1980 with Einstein satellite [\citep=Einstein]. These results suggest that the X-ray spectrum became softer as the source became brighter ([\cite=Idesawa] [\cite=Isobe]). This trend was interpreted in the following way: during the quiescent state, the IC component dominates the X-ray spectrum [\citep=Isobe]. However, once the X-ray flux increases, the high-frequency end of the SR component extends to the X-ray band and exhibits a softer spectrum. In fact, [\citet=Isobe] have successfully decomposed the X-ray spectrum obtained with ASCA at the first flare in 1994 into soft and hard PL components representing the SR and the IC components, respectively. Moreover, in the XMM-Newton observation of the recent first flare in 2005, the source exhibited a concave broken-PL-like X-ray spectrum ([\cite=Ciprini]) which also supports the idea that there is a contribution from the soft component. On the other hand, the spectral behavior in the second flare of OJ 287 observed with Suzaku was completely the opposite to the previous X-ray trend in the first flares.

In order to perform a quantitative evaluation of the possible soft excess component in the Suzaku X-ray spectrum obtained in MWL II, we employed an additional steep PL model modified with the Galactic absorption. The photon index of the additional steep PL component was fixed at 2.62, which is the best fit value for the first flare in 1994 ([\cite=Isobe]), while its normalization was left free. As a result of this two-component model fitting, the upper limit on the flux density of the additional soft PL component was derived as 8.7 nJy at the 3σ level (see table [\ref=table:XIS_log]), while the hard component remained consistent with the best fit values for the single PL model fitting (χ2  /  d.o.f.  =  566.4 / 519). Thus, we obtained the upper limit on the ratio of the soft to the hard components at 1 keV as 0.022, although the ratio was estimated to be 0.186  ±  0.034 in the first flare of 1994 ([\cite=Isobe]). Therefore, the contribution from the soft component in MWL II was negligible in comparison to that of the first flare, and the hard component fully dominated the XIS spectrum over the 0.5 - 10 keV range.

Figure [\ref=fig:SED] shows the overall SED of OJ 287 for the Suzaku pointing in MWL I and MWL II, including the optical R-band data from the KVA Telescope, as well as some historical data. In the figure, we recognize two spectral components, which are typical of blazars. The low frequency SR component, extending from radio to optical frequencies, has a spectral turnover at around 5  ×  1014 Hz. At the same time, the observed SR component is well above the extrapolation from the upper limit of the soft PL component in MWL II (~  1  ×  10- 12erg  ~  s -  1  ~  cm -  2 at 5  ×  1014 Hz). Therefore, we naturally attribute the observed hard X-ray spectrum to the IC component rising toward the higher frequency range. The SED indicates that both the SR and IC intensities increased from MWL I to MWL II without any significant shift of the SR peak frequency.

As a working hypothesis, here we assume simply that the variation of the SED was caused by a change in electron energy density (or number density) and/or the maximum Lorentz factor of the electrons, with stable magnetic field, volume of emission region, minimum Lorentz factor, and break of electron energy distribution (e.g., [\cite=Mrk421]). In order to evaluate this hypothesis, we applied a one-zone SSC model to the SED by using the numerical code developed by [\citet=Kataoka]. The electron number density spectrum was assumed to be a broken PL and the index of the electron spectrum (p) below the break Lorentz factor was determined by the X-ray photon index as p = 2Γ  -  1  =  2.3 and 2.0, in MWL I and MWL II, respectively. We obtained the following seven free parameters to describe the observed SED: the Doppler factor (δ), the electron energy density (ue), the magnetic field (B), the blob radius (R), and the minimum, break, and maximum Lorentz factor of the electrons (γ min, γbreak, and γ max, respectively). Adopting the optical variability time scale (Tvar  ~   4 days; section [\ref=sec:optical_obs]) in MWL II, the relation between δ and R should be subjected to R  <  cTvarδ  /  (1 + z)  =  1.2  ×  1017(Tvar  /  4days)(δ  /  15) ~ cm where c and z are the speed of light and the redshift of the source, respectively.

We derived the SSC model parameters as summarized in table [\ref=table:SSC_log]. The resultant model curves are shown with solid lines in figure [\ref=fig:SED]. The both model predictions are well below the upper limit on the VHE γ-ray spectra. The SED in MWL I was reproduced with δ = 15, B = 0.71 G, R = 7.0  ×  1016  ~  , [formula], γbreak ~  =  ~ 700, γ max = 3300, and ue = 1.5  ×  10- 3  ~  . The δ and R are typical values for LBL [\citep=Ghi98]. On the other hand, in the SED in MWL II, the SSC model with ue = 2.1  ×  10- 3  ~   and [formula] was found to describe the SED successfully, while the other parameters remained unchanged. Thus, we adopt the interpretation that the increase in the electron energy density produced the second flare.

The SED spectra obtained in 1st and 2nd flare during 2005 - 2008 outburst are suggested to have different features as we saw in the X-ray spectra obtained with XMM-Newton and Suzaku. The difference in these SED spectra may require not only simple 'disk impact' [\citep=Valtonen_nature], but also a state transition of the disk - jet system [\citep=disk-jet].

In 2008, Fermi successfully detected a γ-ray spectrum from the quiescent state of OJ 287 during its first three months [\citep=fermi_detect], as shown in figure [\ref=fig:SED]. The measured γ-ray flux significantly exceeds our simple SSC model flux. This may indicate a contribution of external Compton (EC) radiation to the γ-ray emission from OJ 287. Assuming that the γ-ray spectrum peaks around ~  1  ×  1022 Hz with a flux of ~  2  ×  10- 11 erg s- 1 cm- 2, as is suggested from figure [\ref=fig:SED], and using the electron spectrum determined from the SSC fitting to the radio-to-X-ray spectrum derived for MWL II, the energy density and typical frequency of useed  ~  10- 5 erg cm- 3 and νseed  ~  1014 Hz in the rest frame of the nucleus (not the jet frame) are required for the seed photons of the EC process. These give the luminosity of the seed photon source as ~  1042 erg s- 1. This luminosity is consistent with that evaluated for 3C 279 [\citep=Inoue], a famous quasar-hosted blazar of which the γ-ray spectrum is thought to be dominated by the EC emission, within an order of magnitude. However, for a precise identification of the seed photon source, it is crucial to make a simultaneous multi-wavelength observation from radio to γ-ray frequencies.

Summary

We performed X-ray observations of OJ 287 in the quiescent state (MWL I) in 2007 April and in the flaring state (MWL II) in 2007 November by using Suzaku, together with radio, optical, and VHE γ-ray observations with NMA, KANATA, and MAGIC, respectively. The obtained results can be summarized as follows.

The brightness of OJ 287 increased by a factor of 2 from MWL I with a 1 keV flux density of 215  ±  5 nJy to MWL II with 404+ 6- 5 nJy. The X-ray spectrum of OJ 287 was harder in MWL II (a photon index of Γ  =  1.50  ±  0.01) than in MWL I (Γ  =  1.65  ±  0.02).

In MWL II, hard X-ray signals from the object were detected with a significance of 5.0σ in the 12 - 27 keV range, for the first time.

The radio and optical fluxes doubled from MWL I to MWL II. No significant VHE γ-ray signals were detected in either observation.

In both observations, the object exhibited a typical blazar-like spectral energy distribution consisting of synchrotron and inverse Compton components. The relative hard X-ray spectrum appeared to be dominated by the inverse Compton components.

No significant difference of the synchrotron cut-off or peak frequency was found between the quiescent and flaring states. This spectral behavior is rather different from that in past flares, in which it appeared that the synchrotron component contributed to the X-ray spectrum.

Based on the synchrotron self-Compton model, the change of the multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution is interpreted as the increase of the electron energy density, without any notable change in either the magnetic field or the electron Lorentz factor.
