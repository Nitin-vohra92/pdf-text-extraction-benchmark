On consistency of the quantum-like representation algorithm

Introduction

During last 80 years tremendous efforts were put to clarify inter-relation between classical and quantum probabilities, see, e.g., von Neumann [\cite=VN] for the first detailed presentation of this problem and see, e.g., Gudder [\cite=GD1]-[\cite=GD3], Svozil [\cite=SV1], [\cite=SV2], Fine [\cite=F], Garola et al. [\cite=GAR1]-[\cite=GAR3], Dvurecenskij and Pulmanova [\cite=DV], Ballentine [\cite=BL], O. Nánásiová et al [\cite=NAN], [\cite=NAN1], Allahverdyan et al [\cite=AL] for modern studies. We remark that during the last 30 years the main interest was attracted by Bell's inequality, see, e.g., for detailed presentation. However, the basic rule of QM is Born's rule. Therefore the study of its origin is not less (and may be even more) important than investigations on Bell's inequality. In this paper we continue to study so called "inverse Born's rule problem" as it was formulated by Khrennikov [\cite=IP1] -[\cite=IP5]:

IBP (inverse Born problem): To construct representation of probabilistic data by a complex probability amplitude which matches Born's rule.

Solution of IBP provides a possibility to represent probabilistic data by "wave functions" and operate with this data by using linear algebra (as we do in conventional QM). In a special case (for a pair of dichotomous observables) this problem was solved in [\cite=IP1] -[\cite=IP5] with the help of so called quantum-like representation algorithm - QLRA. Formally the output of QLRA depends on the order of conditioning. For two observables a and b, b|a- and a|b conditional probabilities produce two representations, say in Hilbert spaces Hb|a and Ha|b. In this paper we prove that under natural assumptions these two representations are unitary equivalent. This result proves consistency of QLRA.

Inversion of Born's Rule

We consider the simplest situation. There are given two dichotomous observables of any origin: a = α1,α2 and b = β1,β2. We set Xa  =  {α1,α2} and Xb  =  {β1,β2} - "spectra of observables".

We assume that there is given the matrix of transition probabilities [formula] where [formula] is the probability to obtain the result b = β under the condition that the result a = α has been obtained. There are also given probabilities [formula] and [formula] Probabilistic data C = {paα,pbβ} are related to some experimental context (in physics preparation procedure).

IBP is to represent this data by a probability amplitude ψ (in the simplest case it is complex valued) such that Born's rule holds for both observables:

[formula]

where {eb|aβ}β∈Xb and {eb|aα}α∈Xa are orthonormal bases for observables b and a, respectively (so the observables are diagonal in respective bases).

In [\cite=IP1] -[\cite=IP5] the solution of IBP is given in the form of an algorithm which constructs a probability amplitude from data. Formally, the output of this algorithm depends on the order of conditioning. By starting with the matrix of transition probabilities [formula] instead of [formula] we construct another probability amplitude ψa|b (the amplitude in ([\ref=BR]) should be denoted by ψb|a) and other bases, {ea|bβ}β∈Xb and {ea|bα}α∈Xa. We shall see that under natural assumptions these two representations are unitary equivalent.

QLRA

Hb|a-conditioning

Suppose that the matrix of transition probabilities [formula] is given. In [\cite=IP1] -[\cite=IP5] the following formula for interference of probabilities (generalizing the classical formula of total probability) was derived: [formula] where the "coefficient of interference"

[formula]

We shall proceed under the conditions:

(1) [formula] is doubly stochastic.

(2) Probabilistic data C = {paα,pbβ} consist of strictly positive probabilities.

(3) Coefficients of interference λβ,β∈Xb, are bounded by one: |λβ|  ≤  1  .

Probabilistic data C such that (3) holds is called trigonometric, because in this case we have the conventional formula of trigonometric interference: [formula] where

[formula]

By using the elementary formula: [formula] for real numbers A,B  >  0,θ∈[0,2π], we can represent the probability pbβ as the square of the complex amplitude (Born's rule): pbβ  =  |ψb|aβ|2  . Here

[formula]

The formula ([\ref=EX1]) gives the quantum-like representation algorithm -- QLRA. For any trigonometric probabilistic data C, QLRA produces the complex amplitude ψb|a (the normalized vector in the two dimensional complex Hilbert space, say Hb|a):

[formula]

where [formula] To solve IBP completely, we would like to have Born's rule not only for the b-variable, but also for the a-variable: paα  =  |〈ψb|a,eb|aα〉|2  ,α∈Xa. Here the a-basis in the Hilbert space Hb|a is given, see [\cite=IP1] -[\cite=IP5] for details, by [formula] It is orthonormal, since [formula] is assumed to be doubly stochastic. In this basis the amplitude ψb|a is represented as

[formula]

We recall that in QM a pure state Ψ is defined as an equivalent class with respect to multipliers of the form c = eiγ. We shall use similar terminology. Each complex amplitude ψb|a produced by QLRA determines a quantum-like state (representing given probabilistic data) - the equivalence class Ψb|a determined by the representative ψb|a.

Ha|b-conditioning

Here

[formula]

For any trigonometric probabilistic data C, QLRA produces the complex amplitude ψa|b (the normalized vector in the two dimensional complex Hilbert space, say Ha|b):

[formula]

where [formula] Here the b-basis in the Hilbert space Ha|b is given by [formula] In this basis the amplitude ψa|b is represented as

[formula]

As in the case of Hb|a-representation, the quantum-like state (representing given probabilistic data) is defined as the equivalence class Ψa|b with the representative ψa|a.

Unitary equivalence of b|a- and a|b-representations

Thus, as we have seen by selecting to types of conditioning, we represented the probabilistic data C = {paα,pbβ} by two quantum-like states, Ψb|a and Ψa|b. We are interested in consistency of these representations.

We remark that any linear operator W:Hb|a  →  Ha|b induces the map of equivalence classes of the unit spheres with respect to multipliers c = eiγ. We define the unitary operator Ua|bb|a:Hb|a  →  Ha|b by U(eb|aα) = ea|bα,α∈Xa. It induces the mentioned map of equivalent classes.

Theorem. The operator Ua|bb|a maps Ψb|a into Ψa|b if and only if the following inter- relation of symmetry takes place for matrices of transition probabilities [formula] and [formula]:

[formula]

for all α and β from spectra of observables a and b. Proof. Take the representative of Ψb|a given by ([\ref=PSI]). Then

[formula]

Our aim is to show that this vector is equivalent to the vector ψa|b given by ([\ref=EXYA]). By using Hb|a analogs of ([\ref=GGTT]) and ([\ref=GGTT1]) for the coefficients of interference and its cos -expression we determine cos θα1:

[formula]

We also calculate

[formula]

where [formula] is given by ([\ref=PSIA]). We use that [formula] where γαj  =   arg ψaαj,j∈{1,2} and this gives that

[formula]

The real part of the equations ([\ref=Psipsi]) and ([\ref=cosgamma]) gives

[formula]

Moreover, since pbβ2 = 1 - pbβ1 and from the condition that [formula] is double stochastic i.e. pa|bα1β2 = pa|bα2β1 = 1 - pa|bα1β1 = 1 - pa|bα2β2, we rewrite ([\ref=ata])

[formula]

Then by ([\ref=GGTT]) and ([\ref=GGTT1]) we obtain cos θβ1:

[formula]

Multiply ([\ref=tio2]) with [formula] and use again that pbβ2 = 1 - pbβ1 and [formula] is double stochastic and

[formula]

We will show that [formula] or equivalent, we show that

[formula]

Multiply [formula] by [formula] in the left-hand side ([\ref=nia]) such that [formula] [formula] [formula] and replace cos θα1 with [formula] in right-hand side

[formula]

From equation ([\ref=elva2]) and ([\ref=yes]) must.

[formula]

Therefore must [formula] iff [formula]. Let

[formula]

Then let us show that this vector is equivalent to the vector ψa|b given by ([\ref=EXYA]).

[formula]

Then put [formula] into ([\ref=EXYA])

[formula]

The complex amplitudes ψa|b and Ua|bb|aψb|a differs only by the multiplicative factor [formula]. Hence, they belong to the same equivalent class of vectors on the unit sphere. Thus they are two representatives of the same quantum state Ψb|a.
