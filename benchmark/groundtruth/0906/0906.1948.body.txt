Invariants of open books of links of surface singularities

Introduction

Let M be an oriented 3-dimensional manifold. By a result of Giroux [\cite=Gi] there is a one-to-one correspondence between open book decompositions of M (up to stabilization) and contact structures on M (up to isotopy). In [\cite=burak-etnyre] Etnyre and Ozbagci consider three invariants associated with a fixed contact structure ξ defined in terms of all open book decompositions supporting it:

[formula] the support genus sg(ξ) is the minimal possible genus for a page of an open book that supports ξ;

[formula] the binding number bn(ξ) is the minimal number of of binding components for an open book supporting ξ and that has pages of genus sg(ξ);

[formula] the norm [formula] of ξ is the negative of the maximal (topological) Euler characteristic of a page of an open book that supports ξ.

In the present article we determine and characterize completely the above invariants under the following restrictions: M will be a rational homology sphere which can be realized as the link of a complex surface singularity (S,0). Moreover, we will restrict ourselves to the collection of those open book decompositions which can be realized as Milnor fibrations determined by some analytic germ (the so-called Milnor open books). Notice that by [\cite=CP], all the Milnor open book decompositions define the same contact structure on M, the canonical contact structure ξcan. This structure is also induced by any complex structure (S,0) realized on the topological type, and it can be characterized completely from the topology of M.

Hence our results will be applied exactly for the canonical contact structure ξcan, and for (analytic) Milnor open books, cf. section [\ref=s5]. The corresponding invariants are denoted by sgan(ξcan), bnan(ξcan) and [formula].

The present article generalize results of [\cite=Mohan] valid for links of rational surface singularities, and we answer some questions of [\cite=burak-etnyre] regarding the above invariants.

Preliminaries

Invariants associated with a resolution.

In what follows we assume that (S,0) is a complex normal surface singularity whose link is a rational homology sphere. Let π:X  →  S be a good resolution. We will denote by [formula] the smooth irreducible components of the exceptional curve E: = π- 1(0) and by Γ its dual graph. By our assumption, each Ei has genus 0 and Γ is a tree.

Consider the free group [formula] generated by the irreducible components of E, i.e. [formula]. On G there is a natural intersection pairing (  ·  ,  ·  ) and a natural partial ordering: [formula] if and only if m'i  ≤  m''i for all i.

We denote the Lipman cone (semi-group) by

[formula]

It is known (see e.g. [\cite=A] [\cite=Lip]) that if [formula] then mi  ≥  0 for all i, and mi > 0 for all i whenever [formula]. Moreover, [formula] admits a unique minimal element (the so-called Artin, or fundamental cycle), denoted by Zmin.

The definition of E +  is motivated by the following fact. Let [formula] be a germ of an analytic function. Then the divisor (π*(f)) in X of [formula] can be written as Dπ(f) + Sπ(f), where Dπ(f), called the compact part of (π*(f)), is supported on E, and Sπ(f) is the strict transform by π of {f = 0}. The collection of compact parts (when f runs over OS,0) forms a semi-group too, it will be denoted by A + . It is a sub-semi-group of E +  (since (π*(f))  ·  Ei) = 0 and (Sπ(f)  ·  Ei)  ≥  0 for all i). The subset [formula] also has a unique minimal element Zmax, the maximal ideal divisor. It is the divisor of the generic hyperplane section. By definitions Zmin  ≤  Zmax.

For rational singularities one has A+  =  E+ (hence Zmax  =  Zmin too). But, in general, these equalities do not hold. The fundamental cycle Zmin can be obtained by Laufer's (combinatorial) algorithm (cf. [\cite=Laufer]), but the structure of A+ (and even of Zmax too) can be very difficult, it depends essentially on the analytic structure of (S,0).

(Milnor) open books.

Assume that [formula] defines an isolated singularity. Let M be the link of (S,0) and [formula] the (transversal) intersection of f- 1(0) with M. Then the Milnor fibration of f defines an open book decomposition of M with binding Lf. One has the following facts:

For any f, consider an embedded good resolution π of the pair (S,f- 1(0)). Then the strict transform Sπ(f) intersects E transversally, and the number of intersection points (Sπ(f),Ei) (i.e. the number of binding components associated with Ei) is exactly - (Dπ(f),Ei). Since the intersection form is negative definite, the collection of binding components {(Sπ(f),Ei)}ni = 1 and Dπ(f)∈A +  determine each other perfectly.

Moreover, by classical results of Stallings and Waldhausen, the (topological type of the) binding Lf  ⊂  M determines completely the open book up to an isotopy, provided that M is a rational homology sphere. ([\cite=EN] provides two different arguments for this fact, one of them based on [\cite=BL], the other one on [\cite=W]. For counterexamples for the statement in the general situation, see e.g. [\cite=41].)

Notice that the classification of all the (Milnor) open books associated with a fixed analytic type of (S,0) and analytic germs f∈OS,0 can be a very difficult problem (in fact, as difficult as the determination of A+).

Therefore, from a topological points of view, it is more natural to consider the open books of all the analytic germs associated with all the analytic structures supported by the topological type of (S,0).

Notice that for a fixed topological type of (S,0), in any (negative definite) plumbing graph of M one can also define the cone E + . The point is that for any non-zero element D of E +  there is a convenient analytic structure on (S,0) and an analytic germ f, such that the plumbing graph can be identified with a dual resolution graph (which serves as an embedded resolution graph for the pair (S,f- 1(0)) too), and D is the compact part Dπ(f), see [\cite=P] [\cite=NP]. Hence, changing the analytic structure of (S,0), we fill by the collections A +  all the semi-group E + .

In particular, for any [formula], there is an open book decomposition (well-defined up to an isotopy) realized as Milnor open book (by a convenient choice of the analytic objects).

For any fixed analytic type (S,0), the open book associated with Zmax is the Milnor fibration of the generic hyperplane section, in particular this open book is (resolution) graph-independent. Similarly, for a fixed topological type of (S,0), the open book associated with Zmin is also graph-independent. It depends only on the topology of the link.

Invariants of Milnor open books.

Let us fix M, a plumbing (or, a dual resolution) graph Γ. Let us consider a Milnor open book associated with an element [formula], cf. ([\ref=en:1]). In the sequel we will consider the following numerical invariants of it:

The number of binding components β(Z) is given by - (Z,E) (which is ≥  1).

Let F be the fiber of the open book. It is an oriented connected surface with - (Z,E) boundary components. Let g(Z) be its genus (the so-called page-genus of the open book) and μ(Z) be the first Betti-number of F (the so-called Milnor number). Clearly:

[formula]

We will also write νi = (Ei,E - Ei), the number of components of E - Ei meeting Ei.

The 'monotoneity' property.

The main results of the next sections targets the 'monotoneity' property of invariants listed in ([\ref=ss:2.3]).

Assume that for any resolution π of (S,0) one has a map [formula]. We say that I = {Iπ}π is monotone if for any two cycles [formula] (i = 1,2) with Z1  ≤  Z2 one has Iπ(Z1)  ≤  Iπ(Z2) for any π.

Assume that the collection of invariants {Iπ}π can be transformed into (or comes from) an invariant I which associates with any (Milnor) open book [formula] of the link a non-negative integer. For any fixed analytic type, let [formula] be the Milnor open book associated with Zmax (considered in any resolution). Similarly, for any topological type, let [formula] be the Milnor open book associated with Zmin (in any resolution of an analytic structure conveniently chosen); cf. ([\ref=en:1])([\ref=en:1.3]).

Then, whenever {Iπ}π is monotone, one has automatically the next consequences:

Fix an analytic singularity (S,0) and consider all the Milnor open books associated with all isolated holomorphic germs f∈OS,0. Then the minimum of integers [formula] of all these Milnor open books [formula] is realized by the generic hyperplane section, i.e. by [formula].

Fix a topological type of a normal surface singularity, and consider the open books associated with all the isolated holomorphic germs of all the possible analytic structures supported by the fixed topological type. Then the minimum of all integers [formula] of all these Milnor open books [formula] is realized by the open book associated with the Artin cycle, i.e. by [formula].

The monotoneity of the genus

The relation between the genus and the Euler-characteristic.

For any fixed graph Γ, we consider the 'canonical cycle' [formula] defined by the (adjunction formulas) (K + Ei,Ei) + 2 = 0 for all i. Then the (holomorphic) Euler-characteristic of any element D∈G is given by

[formula]

Fix [formula]. Then

[formula]

For any 1  ≤  i  ≤  n consider ki: =  - (Z,Ei) (the number of binding components associated with Ei). Write also [formula]. Then by the A'Campo's formula (cf. [\cite=A'Campo]) [formula]. Then use ([\ref=eq:1]) and ([\ref=eq:2]).

Since χ( - Z) + χ(Z) + Z2 = 0, one also has g(Z) = 1 + (Z,E - Z) - χ(Z). Since for any [formula] one gets Z  ≥  E, one has (Z,E - Z)  ≥  0 too. In particular:

[formula]

Recall that rational singularities are characterized by χ(Zmin) = 1 [\cite=A]. If additionally, (S,0) is a minimal (i.e. if Zmin = E), then g(Zmin) = 0. For arbitrary rational germs one has g(Zmin) = (Zmin,E - Zmin)  ≥  0. This number, in general, might be non-zero: e.g. in the case of the E8-singularity it is 1. Considering arbitrary singularities, χ(Zmin) tends to -    ∞   as the complexity of the topological type of the germ increases, hence by ([\ref=eq:gchi]) g(Zmin) tends to infinity too.

The "virtual genus" and its positivity.

The formula ([\ref=eq:3]) motivates the following definition. For [formula], let |D| be the support [formula] of D and #  (D) the number of connected components of |D|.

For D∈G, D  ≥  0, we define the "virtual genus" of D by

[formula]

Since for any [formula] one has |Z| = E, and E is connected, ([\ref=eq:4]) extends ([\ref=eq:3]). Moreover, for any such [formula], by its definition, g(Z)  ≥  0.

The virtual genus of any D∈G, D  ≥  0, is positive: g(D)  ≥  0.

Assume that the statement is not true at least for one such a cycle. Since g(Ei) = 1 + E2i  +  χ( - Ei) = 0, there exist a minimal cycle D > 0 with g(D) < 0. Clearly, we can assume that |D| is connected (and replacing Γ by its subgraph supported on |D|) that |D| = E. Write [formula]. Hence we have:

[formula]

and, using the notation #  i for the number of components of |D - Ei|:

[formula]

for all Ei. Since χ(A + B) = χ(A) + χ(B) - (A,B), the two inequalities can easily be compared. Indeed, first assume that mi = 1 for some i. Then |D - Ei| = E - Ei and #  i  =  νi, hence ([\ref=eq:11]) and ([\ref=eq:12]) contradict each other. Therefore, mi  ≥  2 for all i. In that case, |D - Ei| = E and #  i = 1, hence ([\ref=eq:11]) and ([\ref=eq:12]) lead to (D - E,Ei)  ≥  0 for all i. Hence (D - E,D - E) is also non-negative by summation. Since the intersection form is negative definite, this implies D = E. This contradicts the fact that D is non-reduced (and also with the fact that g(E) = 0).

The monotoneity of the genus

The main result of this section is the following inequality:

Consider two cycles Z and Z + D, where [formula] and D∈G, D  ≥  0. Then the (virtual) genera satisfy g(Z)  ≤  g(Z + D).

By ([\ref=eq:3]), one has

[formula]

If |D| = E then #  (D) = 1 and - (D,Z)  ≥  1 (otherwise we would have (Z,Ei) = 0 for all i, or Z = 0). If |D| < E, then - (D,Z)  ≥  0 and (D,E - |D|)  ≥  (|D|,E - |D|)  ≥    #  (D) by the connectivity of Γ. Hence, in both cases, the right-hand side is ≥  g(D). Since g(D)  ≥  0 by ([\ref=th:1]), the inequality follows.

The genus is monotone: for any Z1 and Z2 from [formula] with Z1  ≤  Z2 one has g(Z1)  ≤  g(Z2). In particular, the statements of ([\ref=re:m]) also hold.

The Milnor number and the number of boundary components

The monotoneity of the Milnor number

If one combines ([\ref=eq:1]) and ([\ref=eq:3]), one gets for any [formula]:

[formula]

Again, we extend the above formula (in a compatible way with ({[\ref=eqn:2])) for any D  ≥  0 by considering the 'virtual Milnor number' μ(D) as g(D) + χ( - D), defined via the virtual genus g(D).

Clearly, μ(Z)  ≥  0 for any [formula], since μ(Z) stays for a Betti number. Moreover, for any rational graph Γ, one has min χ  =  0, hence for them the virtual invariants satisfy μ(D)  ≥  g(D)  ≥  0 too. The next theorem generalizes this for a general Γ.

Set D∈G with D  ≥  0. Then the following inequalities hold:

χ( - D)  ≥  0;

μ(D)  ≥  g(D)  ≥  0;

μ(Z + D)  ≥  μ(Z)  for any [formula].

The proof of ([\ref=en:mu.1]) is well-known for specialist, for the convenience of the reader we provide it. We claim that for any D > 0 there exists at least one Ei with Ei  ≤  D such that χ( - D + Ei)  ≤  χ( - D). This by induction shows that χ( - D)  ≥  0. The proof of the claim runs as follows. Assume that it is not true for some D > 0. Then for any Ei from its support one has χ( - D + Ei)  ≥  χ( - D) + 1. This is equivalent with (D,Ei)  ≥  0, hence by summation one gets D2  ≥  0. This implies D = 0, a contradiction.

([\ref=en:mu.2]) follows from ([\ref=eqn:2]), part ([\ref=en:mu.1]) and ([\ref=th:1]). For ([\ref=en:mu.3]) notice that by ([\ref=eqn:2])

[formula]

Notice that g(Z + D)  ≥  g(Z) by ([\ref=th:2]), χ( - D)  ≥  0 by ([\ref=en:mu.1]), and - (Z,D)  ≥  0 since Z∈E + .

The Milnor number is monotone: for any Z1 and Z2 from [formula] with Z1  ≤  Z2 one has μ(Z1)  ≤  μ(Z2). In particular, the statements of ([\ref=re:m]) also hold for μ.

The number of binding components

Recall that the number of binding components of the open book associated with some [formula] is β(Z) =  - (Z,E). We wish to understand the variation of this number in the realm of (Milnor) open books with page-genus fixed. In order to do this, let us consider the following subsets of E + :

[formula]

where [formula]. Since μ(Z) - β(Z) = 2g(Z) - 1, we get:

For any a, the restrictions of μ and β to E+g = a take their minima on the same elements of E+g = a. In particular, the restriction of μ (resp. of β) on E+min is μ(Zmin) (resp. β(Zmin)).

Application to the canonical contact structure of the link

Our application targets the invariants sgan(ξcan), bnan(ξcan) and [formula]; for notations, see Introduction. Indeed, the previous results read as follows:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

In particular,

[formula]

These facts answer some of the questions of [\cite=burak-etnyre], section 8, at least in the realm of Milnor open books.
