INTRODUCTION

Spin observables for any particle reaction, contain some unique information which allow a deeper understanding of the nature of the underlying dynamics and this is very usefull to check the validity of theoretical assumptions. We emphasize the relevance of positivity in spin physics, which puts non-trivial model independent constraints on spin observables. If one, two or several observables are measured, the constraints can help to decide which new observable will provide the best improvement of knowledge. Different methods can be used to establish these constraints and they have been presented together with many interesting cases in a recent review article [\cite=aerst]. If X, Y, Z are spin observables with the standard normalization - 1  ≤  X  ≤   + 1, the domain for the pair of observables (X,Y) is often smaller than the square 2 and the domain for the triple of observables (X,Y,Z) is often smaller than the cube 3. Explicit inequalities are obtained, relating two or three spin observables, for instance X2 + Y2  ≤  1, corresponding to a disk, or X2 + Y2 + Z2  ≤  1, corresponding to a sphere, but one is also led to triangles, tetrahedrons, etc...(see below).

EXCLUSIVE REACTIONS

i) - πN  →  πN scattering A scattering process involving spinning particles and described by n complex amplitudes is fully determined by (2n - 1) real functions, up to an over-all phase. Since there are n2 possible measurements for this reaction, we must have (n - 1)2 independent quadratic relations between the n2 observables. First consider the simplest case of an exclusive two-body reaction with a spin 0 and a spin 1/2 particle, namely 0  +  1 / 2  →  0  +  1 / 2. As an example πN  →  πN is described in terms of two amplitudes, the non-flip f+ and the flip f-, so we have four observables, the cross section dσ / dt, the polarization Pn and two rotation parameters R and A. There is one well known quadratic relation, that is P2n  +  A2  +  R2  =  1. If all three are measured they should lie on the surface of the unit sphere, which is a consistency check of the data. Concerning the crossed reaction p  →  ππ, large spin effects have been seen at LEAR. One has an analogous identity as the one above for πN, namely A2n + A2mm + A2ml = 1. Hence |An| = 1, implies Amm = Aml = 0. For p  →  qK similar results were obtained [\cite=aerst].

ii) - Spin1 / 2  +  Spin1 / 2  →  Spin1 / 2  +  Spin1 / 2 For the reaction 1 / 2  +  1 / 2  →  1 / 2  +  1 / 2, for example pp elastic scattering, we have five amplitudes, therefore twenty-five observables and sixteen quadratic relations between them. For the derivation one considers a 5x5 matrix of the observables, which is positive Hermitian and the final results can be found in Ref. [\cite=bs]. These relations are very useful to check the data and when one observable is not measured, it is set to zero and the equality becomes an inequality. In particular one finds the following very simple condition A2LL  +  D2NN  ≤  1, between the two-spin correlation parameters ALL and DNN. This condition turns out to be very usefull because if one of the parameters is close to one, the other one is bounded to be near zero. In the reaction p  →  Λ̄Λ, one has found in a certain kinematic region ALL =  - 1, so before making any measurement one can conclude that DNN  ~  0, which is also a no-go theorem for some theoretical considerations [\cite=jmr]. An empirical method consists of generating randomly six complex amplitudes, for p  →  Λ̄Λ, to compute the spin observables and look at the constraints (see Fig. 1). The empirical method was extended to the case of triple of spin observables. Several remarkable shapes were discovered for the allowed domain: sphere, cylinder, cone, pyramid, tetrahedron, octahedron, intersection of two cylinders, intersection of three orthogonal cylinders, coffee filter, etc...[\cite=aerst].

iii) - Pseudoscalar meson photoproduction Consider the reactions γN  →  KY, with Y = Λ,Σ, where the incoming photon beam is polarized, the nucleon target is polarized and the polarization of the outgoing Λ,Σ is measured. Need to determine four complex amplitudes, i.e. seven real numbers. One can perform sixteen different experiments: the unpolarized cross section, three single spin asymmetries, the linearly polarized photon asymmetry Σγ, the polarized target asymmetry AN and the recoil baryon polarization PY. We have the linear relations |AN  ±  PY|  ≤  1  ±  Σγ, which give the tetrahedron shown in Fig. 2. The allowed volume is 1/3 of the entire cube 3. Finally, there are four double correlations between the target and the recoil baryon spins in the scattering plane with unpolarized photons, four double spin correlations with linearly polarized photons and four double spin correlations with circularly polarized photons. Clearly, these sixteen measurements must be constrained by nine quadratic relations, for example, PY and the double correlation parameters between the circularly polarized photon and the recoil baryon spin along the directions x̂ and ẑ in the scattering plane, CYx and CYz, i.e. (PY)2  +  (CYx)2  +  (CYz)2  ≤  1. Following the analysis of the CLAS data at Jefferson Lab., it is almost saturated and this implies the saturation of other quadratic constraints with three or more observables [\cite=aerst].

INCLUSIVE REACTIONS

i) - Asymmetries in DIS A bound on the DIS transverse asymmetry A2 has been established long time ago and reads [formula] where R is the standard ratio σL  /  σT. There is an improved version of this positivity constraint, namely, [formula], which is very relevant when the DIS longitudinal asymmetry A1 is negative. This is the case for An1, with a neutron target in a certain kinematic range.

ii) - Spin-transfer observables Consider a parity conserving inclusive reaction of the type, a(spin1 / 2)  +  b(unpol.)  →  c(spin1 / 2)  +  X. One can define eight observables, which must satisfy

[formula]

If we concentrate for the moment on the case where the particle spins are normal to the scattering, for example for [formula], one has 1  ±  DNN  ≥  |PΛ  ±  AN|. The corresponding allowed domains are displayed on Fig. 3.

iii) - Quark Transversity Distribution δq(x,Q2) In addition to q(x,Q2) and Δq(x,Q2), there is a new distribution function δq(x,Q2), chiral odd, leading twist, which decouples from DIS and has been indirectly extracted recently for the first time. It must satisfy the following positivity bound [\cite=js], q(x,Q2)  +  Δq(x,Q2)  ≥  2|δq(x,Q2)|, which survives up to NLO corrections. The corresponding allowed triangle occured also for p  →  Λ̄Λ, as seen above.
