Inclusive ALL Measurements at STAR

Introduction

Collisions of polarized protons at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) offer a window into the spin composition of the proton through measurements of longitudinal double-spin asymmetries in a variety of final states [\cite=Bunce:2000uv]. Jet and pion production at STAR [\cite=Ackermann:2002ad] is dominated by gg and qg scattering, providing sensitivity to the polarized gluon distribution Δg(x,Q2) over a restricted kinematic region of 0.03  <  x  <  0.3.

One can write the longitudinal double-spin asymmetry ALL in terms of experimental quantities as

[formula]

where P1,2 are the polarizations of the colliding proton beams, N+  + and N+  - are the identified particle yields when the proton helicities are aligned and anti-aligned, and R is the ratio of the beam luminosities in the two helicity configurations. The beam polarizations at RHIC are measured every few hours using a high-statistics Coulomb Nuclear Interference (CNI) polarimeter [\cite=Jinnouchi:2004up], and the analyzing power of the CNI polarimeter is normalized using a gas jet polarimeter [\cite=Okada:2006dd]. The spin-dependent relative luminosities are measured at STAR using the Beam Beam Counters (BBCs), segmented scintillator annuli located up and downstream of the STAR interaction region that provide full azimuthal coverage. Coincident signals in the two BBCs define STAR's pp minimum-bias trigger condition; this approach samples 87% of the non-singly diffractive scattering cross section [\cite=Adams:2003kv]. The BBCs can also be used to measure residual transverse beam polarization, which manifests as an azimuthal asymmetry in the scintillator tile counts [\cite=Kiryluk:2005gg]. The minimum-bias trigger condition is necessary but not sufficient to select events for the analyses reviewed here. Also required is an transverse energy deposit in one of the electromagnetic calorimeters which enhances STAR's sampling of hard scattering events.

Jets

Jets are reconstructed at STAR using a midpoint cone algorithm [\cite=Blazey:2000qt] that clusters charged track and electromagnetic energy deposits within a cone of radius [formula]. Earlier measurements used a smaller 0.4 cone radius because the Barrel Electromagnetic Calorimeter (BEMC) was not yet fully commissioned. Charged track momenta are measured by the Time Projection Chamber (TPC). Neutral energy deposits are measured by the Barrel and Endcap EMCs. Events are selected using a Jet Patch (JP) trigger algorithm that looks for a transverse energy deposition in fixed Δη  ×  Δφ  =  1.0  ×  1.0 patches of the BEMC above some threshold. In the 2006 RHIC run, that threshold was primarily set at 8.3 GeV.

Figure [\ref=fig:jet-all] presents STAR's preliminary measurement of inclusive jet ALL obtained by analyzing 4.7 pb- 1 of data collected during the 2006 RHIC run [\cite=Gagliardi:2008qw]. The uncertainties on the data points are statistical; the gray bands plot asymmetric point-to-point systematic uncertainties. The data are compared to a variety of predictions for ALL assuming various input distributions for the gluon polarization in the GRSV framework [\cite=Jager:2004jh].

The inclusive jet data from STAR (as well as π0 data from PHENIX) have been incorporated into a global analysis used to extract polarized parton distribution functions [\cite=deFlorian:2008mr]. The right panel of Figure [\ref=fig:jet] shows the result of this analysis for Δg(x); compared to previous global analyses, the uncertainties on the pdf shrink dramatically in the kinematic regime sampled by inclusive RHIC channels ([formula]).

Neutral Pions

Pions decaying via the two photon channel are reconstructed over a wide range in rapidity at STAR by a suite of electromagnetic calorimeters. The Barrel and Endcap EMCs are lead-scintillator sampling calorimeters that use shower maximum detectors situated a few radiation lengths into the detector to resolve decays where both photons are coincident on the same tower, thus extending the pT reach of the measurements as high as 16 GeV/c. The Forward Pion Detector (FPD) is comprised of lead-glass cell matrices situated ~  750 cm from the interaction region. The FPD modules can be positioned at different transverse distances from the beamline, allowing for measurements at multiple values of η.

Figure [\ref=fig:pi0-all] displays ALL results for each of these calorimeters [\cite=Hoffman:2008zz] [\cite=Wissink:2008zz]. As in the case of the inclusive jet measurement, the data are compared to predictions assuming various input distributions for the polarized gluon distribution. In contrast to the jet measurement, the bias from the triggering system in π0 analyses is typically negligible. A thorough understanding of π0 reconstruction is also an important prerequisite for future direct photon measurements.

Charged Pions

Figure [\ref=fig:charged-all] presents STAR's preliminary results for charged pion ALL opposite a trigger jet, plotted versus [formula] [\cite=Kocoloski:2009aa]. Point-to-point systematic uncertainties from a variety of sources are summed in quadrature and included as the gray bars. The dominant systematic uncertainty arises from the use of the JP trigger to select events. This trigger a) hardens the jet pT spectrum in each z bin, and b) preferentially selects quark jets over gluon jets. The first effect is quantified by using Monte Carlo to determine the trigger efficiency for jets at a given pT, and the theoretical predictions for ALL for this observable are adjusted to account for that efficiency [\cite=deFlorian:2009fw]. Future analyses with greater statistical precision may be able to avoid this requirement by binning in both jet pT and z. For b) STAR investigates how our LO Monte Carlo evaluation of ALL changes when we require the JP trigger condition. Specifically, we compare our MC asymmetries for the JP trigger with MC asymmetries that incorporate only the trigger efficiency, not the subprocess bias. The difference between the two is a measure of how the trigger's preference for quark jets affects ALL.

Conclusions and Outlook

STAR has a robust program of inclusive double-spin asymmetry measurements. Global analyses incorporating STAR data have established significant new constraints on the polarized gluon distribution in the proton. These measurements set the stage for a program of correlation measurements at both [formula] = 200 GeV and 500 Gev that will extend the sampled x range and more precisely map out the x-dependence of the polarized gluon distribution.
