Hahn Decomposition Theorem of Signed Lattice Measure

Introduction

In this paper, we will show Hahn Decomposition Theorem of Signed Lattice Measure when the Lattice do not necessarily satisfy the law of non-contradiction. We consider a set X and a Lattice L of subsets of X, which may not satisfy the law of non-contradiction and which contain [formula] and X.

We will define a signed Lattice measure on σ-algebras, and we will show that the Lattice Hahn Decomposition Theorem decomposes any set X into a positive Lattice A and a negative Lattice B such that [formula]=X and the signed Lattice measure of [formula] is 0.

This theory discussed in this paper is a Lattice version of the paper [\cite=Junhahndeco]. In the paper [\cite=Junhahndeco], J. Tanaka showed Hahn Decomposition Theorem of Signed Fuzzy Measure. As one already saw, Fuzzy measure is a classical measure, provided that fuzzy sets are restricted to classical sets. As in classical measure theory, he defined a fuzzy signed measure on σ-algebras, and he showed that the Fuzzy Hahn Decomposition Theorem decomposes any space X into a positive set A and a negative set B such that A+B=X and the signed measure of [formula] is 0.

Unfortunately, the monotonicity prohibits the signed Lattice measure from being a signed measure in a classical sense. Please note that monotonicity is not required in the definition of classical signed measure. In Section [\ref=sec:2], we will define a signed Lattice measure on σ-algebras, as well as give the definition of positive and negative Lattice. Furthermore, we will show that any countable union of positive Lattice is a positive Lattice, as well as the following proposition: if E is a Lattice such that 0 <  ν(E)  <    ∞  , then there is a positive Lattice A ≤  E with ν(A)  >   0. Finally, we will show the Hahn Decomposition Theorem for signed Lattice measure in the section titled Main Result.

Preliminaries : Extension of Lattice

In this section, we shall briefly review the well-known facts about lattice theory (e.g. Birkhoff [\cite=Birk] ), propose an extension lattice, and investigate its properties. (L,[formula],[formula]) is called a lattice if it is closed under operations [formula] and [formula] and satisfies, for any elements x,y,z in L:

(L1) the commutative law: x [formula] y = y [formula] x and x [formula] y = y [formula] x

(L2) the associative law:

[formula]

(L3) the absorption law: x [formula] ( y [formula] x ) =x and x [formula] ( y [formula] x ) = x.

Hereinafter, the lattice (L,[formula],[formula]) will often be written as L for simplicity.

A mapping h from a lattice L to another L' is called a lattice-homomorphism, if it satisfies

[formula]

If h is a bijection, that is, if h is one-to-one and onto, it is called a lattice-isomorphism; and in this case, L' is said to be lattice-isomorphic to L.

A lattice (L,[formula],[formula]) is called distributive if, for any x,y,z in L,

(L4) the distributive law holds:

[formula]

A lattice L is called complete if, for any subset A of L, L contains the supremum [formula] A and the infimum [formula] A. If L is complete, then L itself includes the maximum and minimum elements, which are often denoted by 1 and 0, or I and O, respectively.

A distributive lattice is called a Boolean lattice if for any element x in L, there exists a unique complement xC such that

[formula]

Let L be a lattice and ·  c: L →   L be an operator. Then ·  c is called a lattice complement in L if the following conditions are satisfied:

[formula]

A complete lattice is called a complete Heyting algebra (cHa) if

[formula]

holds for [formula] (i∈I); where I is an index set of arbitrary cardinal number.

It is well-known that for a set E, the power set P(E) = 2E. The set of all subsets of E is a Boolean algebra.

Definitions and Lemmas

Throughout this paper, we will consider Lattices as complete Lattices which obey (L1)-(L8) except for (L6) the law of non-contradiction.

Unless otherwise stated, X is the entire set and L is a Lattice of any subset sets of X. If a Lattice L satisfies the following conditions, then it is called a Lattice σ-algebra;

(1) [formula], hC∈L

(2) if hn∈L for n=1,2,3...., then [formula].

We denote σ(L) as the Lattice σ-Algebra generated by L.

If m : σ(L) ↦   [formula] satisfies the following properties, then m is called a Lattice measure on the Lattice σ-Algebra σ(L).

(1) m [formula] = m (0) = 0.

(2) [formula] s.t. m(h),m(g)  ≥   0 : h  ≤  g   ⇒   m (h)  ≤   m (g).

(3) [formula] : m[formula] m[formula] m(h)  +   m(g).

(4) if hn ⊂  σ(L),n∈N such that [formula], then [formula] m(hn).

Let m1 and m2 be Lattice measures defined on the same Lattice σ-algebra σ(L). If one of them is finite, the set function m(E)  =  m1(E)  -  m2(E) , E∈σ(L) is well defined and countably additive on σ(L). However, it is not necessarily nonnegative; it is called a signed Lattice measure.

By a signed Lattice measure on the measurable Lattice (X, σ(L)) we mean ν : σ(L) ↦   [formula] or [formula], satisfying the following property:

(1) [formula] = ν(0) = 0.

(2) [formula] s.t. ν(h),ν(g)  ≥   0 : h  ≤  g   ⇒   ν(h)  ≤  ν(g).

[formula] s.t. ν(h),ν(g)  ≤   0 : h  ≤  g   ⇒   ν(g)  ≤  ν(h).

(3) [formula] : [formula].

(4) if hn ⊂  σ(L),n∈N such that [formula], then [formula] m(hn).

This is meant in the sense that if the left-hand side is finite, the limit on the right-hand side is convergent, and if the left-hand side is   ±    ∞  , then the limit on the right-hand side diverges accordingly.

The signed Lattice measure is a Lattice measure when it takes only positive values. Thus, the signed Lattice measure is a generalization of Lattice measure.

A is a positive Lattice if for any Lattice measurable set E in A, ν(E)  ≥  0. Similarly, B is a negative Lattice if for any Lattice measurable set E in B, ν(E)  ≤  0.

Every sublattice of a positive Lattice is a positive Lattice and any countable union of positive Lattices is a positive Lattice.

The first claim is clear. Before we show the second claim, we need to show that every union of positive Lattice is a positive Lattice. Let A, B be positive Lattices and E ≤   A [formula] B be a measurable Lattice. By (2) in Definition [formula], 0 ≤   [formula] - [formula]. By (3), ν(E)  ≥   0. Now by induction, every finite union of positive Lattice is a positive Lattice. Let An be a positive Lattice for all n and E ≤   [formula] An be a measurable Lattice. Then Em := [formula] = [formula]. Then Em is a measurable Lattice and a positive Lattice. In particular, Em  ≤  Em + 1 for all n and E = [formula]. Thus 0 ≤   lim ν(Em) = ν(E). Therefore [formula] An is a positive Lattice.

Let E be a measurable Lattice such that 0 <  ν(E)  <    ∞  . Then there is a positive Lattice A ≤  E with ν(A)  >   0.

If E is a positive Lattice, we take A=E. Otherwise, E contains a Lattice of negative measure. Let n1 be the smallest positive integer such that there is a measurable Lattice E1  ⊂   E with [formula]. Proceeding inductively, if E[formula] is not already a positive Lattice, let nk be the smallest positive integer for which there is a measurable Lattice Ek such that [formula] and [formula].

Let A = [formula].

Then ν(E) = [formula] = [formula]. Since ν(E) is finite, [formula] is finite and [formula] 0. Since ν(E)  >   0 and [formula] 0, [formula] 0.

We will show that A is a positive Lattice. Let ε  >   0. Since [formula] 0, we may choose k such that [formula]. Thus A contains no measurable Lattice of measure less than   -  ε. Since ε was an arbitrary positive number, it follows that A can contain no Lattice of negative measure and so must be a positive Lattice.

Main result: Lattice Hahn Decomposition

Without loss of generality, let's omit + ∞   as a value of ν. Let λ = sup {ν(A):A is a positive Lattice }.

Then λ  ≥   0 since [formula] = 0.

Let Ai be a sequence of positive Lattices such that λ = lim ν(Ai) and A = [formula]. By Theorem [formula], A is a positive Lattice and λ  ≥  ν(A).

[formula] A for any n implies [formula] 0 for any n. Thus λ = lim ν(Ai) = ν(A) = 0.

Let E  ≤  AC be a positive Lattice. Then ν(E)  ≥   0 and [formula] is a positive Lattice. Thus λ  ≥   [formula] = [formula]. Thus [formula]. We have that ν(E) = 0 since [formula] and [formula] = 0.

Thus, AC contains no positive sublattice of positive measure and hence no sublattice of positive measure by Lemma [formula]. Consequently, AC is a negative Lattice.

Conclusion

Let X be an entire set. Then by the previous theorem, we find such a positive Lattice A and a negative Lattice B (= AC). By the Lattice measurability of ν, [formula] = 0. [formula] = X. These characteristics provide the following: X = [formula] and [formula] in the classical set sense.
