Dynamical Heterogeneities and Cooperative Motion in Smectic Liquid Crystals

Smectic liquid crystals consist of stacks of fluidlike layers of oriented rodlike particles [\cite=degennes]. They can be stabilized by attractive Van der Waals forces, e.g. in thermotropic systems of mesogenic molecules [\cite=degennes], or by repulsive hard-core interactions between sufficiently elongated particles [\cite=frenkel]. In the relatively simple smectic-A phase the static structure is characterized by long-range orientational ordering of the rods combined with a one-dimensional periodic density variation in the direction parallel to the rods. While the equilibrium properties of smectic phases are relatively well understood [\cite=degennes], little is known about their dynamics on the particle scale, even though Helfrich's early report of diffusion ("permeation") of anisotropic particles through smectic layers goes back 40 years [\cite=helfrich]. Recently, however, exciting progress was made based on newly developed experimental techniques (e.g. NMR coupled to strong magnetic field gradients [\cite=furo], or fluorescent labelling of rods [\cite=lettinga]), which revealed direct observations of non-Gaussian diffusion and quasiquantized layer-to-layer hopping across a barrier [\cite=lettinga]. This triggered new theoretical work, based on dynamic density functional theory (DDFT), which not only confirmed the non-Gaussian diffusive motion and the one-dimensional "permanent" barriers due to the static smectic background, but also showed the importance of "temporary" cages formed by neighboring rods [\cite=bier].

Interestingly, non-Gaussian diffusive behavior due to heterogeneous dynamics of "slow" and "fast" particles is also a key feature in glassy systems and supercooled liquids, in which individual particles are trapped in transient cages formed by their neighbors. This heterogeneous dynamics explains the experimentally observed nonexponential relaxation and stretching of time correlation functions and is found to be closely related to cage rearrangements and to cooperative motion, in which a small fraction of the particles (typically a few percent) move collectively in stringlike [\cite=kob] [\cite=donati] or compact [\cite=appignanesi] [\cite=berthier] clusters . Several models based on a heterogeneous distribution of diffusion coefficients, jump times or jump lengths have been introduced to explain the heterogeneous dynamics due to temporary cages [\cite=chaudhuri], while another model explains the non-Gaussian diffusion by the dynamics of a single Brownian particle in a periodic external potential, which is very similar to the permanent barriers of the smectic-A phase [\cite=vorselaars]. The intriguing question that we address in this Letter is to what extent the dynamics in the smectic-A phase is heterogeneous and/or collective, or, in other words, to what extent is the equilibrium smectic-A dynamics resemblant to that of out-of-equilibrium quenched supercooled liquids? This issue cannot be addressed directly in fluorescence experiments, in which only a small fraction of the rods is labelled such that moving clusters cannot be observed. While DDFT yields average quantities such as density profiles, Van Hove functions, and single-particle barriers, but does not provide cluster information [\cite=bier]. We therefore resort to computer simulations of hard-rod fluids in the smectic phase. Contrary to the essentially one-particle analysis of Ref. [\cite=cinacchi], we do find clear evidence for heterogeneous dynamics and cooperative permeation of strings of 1-10 rods.

We perform kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations in the isobaric-isothermal ensemble (NPT) of N = 1530 - 3000 freely rotating hard spherocylinders with aspect ratio [formula], where D is the diameter and L + D the length of the rods. For L* = 5 the smectic bulk phase melts into a nematic phase below P* = 1.4 and freezes into a crystal above P* = 2.3, where P* = PD3 / kBT is the reduced pressure with kB Boltzmann's constant [\cite=bolhuis]. We study the dynamics at two state points in the bulk smectic phase characterized by P*1 = 1.6 and P*2 = 2.0, which correspond to packing fractions η1 = 0.508 and η2 = 0.557, respectively. Translational and rotational moves are attempted and accepted if no overlap is detected. A rectangular simulation box with 5-10 smectic layers and periodic boundary conditions are employed. Volume changes are attempted every N MC steps by randomly changing the side length of the simulation box. In KMC simulations it is convenient to relate the number of MC cycles to time t. We chose [formula] as our unit of time, where Dtr is the translational short-time diffusion coefficient, which is the isotropic average of the diffusion coefficients in the three space dimensions.

Denoting the positions of the rods by [formula], we first measure the (relative) probability π(z) of finding a rod at position z, where the z-axis is parallel to the nematic director n̂. Following Ref. [\cite=lettinga] we introduce the Boltzmann factor [formula] with U(z) the effective potential for diffusion out of the middle of a smectic layer. Fig. 1 shows U(z) in a small z-regime for our two state points together with the fit [formula], with barrier height U0 = (3.5,7.5)kBT and layer spacing h = (L + D)(1.05,1.03) as fit parameters for the two states. The denser state thus reveals a substantially larger diffusion barrier and a stronger confinement to the middle of the smectic layers.

In order to further quantify the physical picture of a hopping-type z-diffusion, with the rods rattling around in a given layer until they overcome the free-energy barrier and jump to a neighboring layer, we calculate the self part of the Van Hove correlation function (VHF) [formula], with [formula] the ensemble average over all particles and initial time t0, and δ the Dirac-delta. Note that Gs(,t) gives the distribution for the particle z-displacements during a time-interval t, and would be a Gaussian of z for freely diffusive particles. Fig. 2(a,b) show the VHF for our two state points as a function of z for several equidistant t's, showing the appearance of peaks at integer layer spacings consistent with earlier experimental [\cite=lettinga] and theoretical [\cite=bier] results. The height and spatial extension of the peaks is larger at η1, indicative of a faster layer-to-layer diffusion than at η2. Non-gaussian VHF's were analyzed in 2D liquids [\cite=hurley], glasses [\cite=chaudhuri], and liquid crystals [\cite=lettinga] [\cite=bier], and attest to the presence of dynamical heterogeneities which imply particles diffusing faster or slower than the average. This is quantified by the well-known non-gaussian parameter (NGP) [\cite=rahman], for z-diffusion defined by αz(t) =  - 1 + 〈Δz(t)4〉 / 3〈Δz(t)2〉2 with Δz(t) = z(t0 + t) - z(t0) the z-displacement of a rod in the time interval t starting at t0. Likewise non-Gaussian in-plane diffusion can be characterised by an NGP αxy(t). Heterogeneous dynamics occurs on a time-scale t if αz(t) or αxy(t) is non-vanishing. In Fig. 2(c,d) we show the NGP's for our two state-points, with αz(t) showing a clear peak at t*≃(2,10)τ, while αxy(t) is hardly visible on the scale of the figure and thus essentially vanishes for all t. In other words, in-plane diffusion is dynamically homogeneous while permeation is heterogeneous, with t* and αz(t*) increasing with density. In order to determine the relaxation dynamics we plot the mean square displacements (MSDs) 〈Δz2(t)〉 and 〈Δx2(t) + Δy2(t)〉 in Fig. 2(e,f) for the two state points. The xy-MSD shows a smooth crossover from short- to long time diffusion, while the z-MSD develops an intermediate cage-trapping plateau up to t* beyond which interlayer diffusion takes place. Note that the z-MSD exceeds the xy-MSD only at short times.

In addition we study structural relaxation by computing the self-intermediate scattering function Fs(t) = 〈 exp [i   ·   Δ(t)]〉 at wavevectors [formula] and (qx,qy,0), with qz = 1 and (q2x + q2y)1 / 2 = 6, that correspond to the main peaks in the static structure factor. Here [formula] denotes the particle displacement during a time-interval t. Results are shown in Fig. 2(g,h). The in-layer dynamics is very fast with nearly exponential decay, typical of fluid-like behavior. By contrast, the inter-layer dynamics is much slower, with Fs(t) decaying in two steps at t' and t'' separated by a plateau during t' < t < t''. Interestingly this plateau (corresponding to β-relaxation) coincides with the nonvanishing of αz(t), and can hence be attributed to the heterogeneity of the dynamics [\cite=kob]. The first step at t' / τ  ≤  1 corresponds to the rattling of rods inside the temporary cage and permanent smectic background formed by neighboring rods [\cite=bier], whereas the second one (α-relaxation) corresponds to the escape on a time scale that increases from t'' / τ≃100 at η1 to 103 at η2. The increase of t'' and that of the height of the plateau of Fs(t) with density is also observed for colloidal glasses [\cite=elmasri]. At η1, the long-time decay of Fs(t) is well fitted by a stretched exponential of the form exp [ -  (t  /  tr))β], with relaxation time [formula] and [formula], once more confirming the heterogeneous nature of the relaxation dynamics [\cite=elmasri]; tr at η2 is beyond our simulation time.

Having established the heterogeneity of the dynamics in the equilibrium smectic bulk phase, our next question concerns the identification of the fast particles. Comparing the VHF at t* of Fig. 1(a) and (b) with a gaussian approximation with the same MSD reveals that the fast-moving particles, which are responsible for the non-gaussian character, have travelled over more than h / 2 during a time interval t*. Therefore they are intimately related to interlayer particles, which reside more than some distance δ from the nearest smectic plane. In order to define δ sensibly, we consider the variance of one period of π(z) as [formula], which gives σ / D = (0.6,0.3) for η1 and η2, respectively, as indicated in Fig.1. We now set δ = kσ with k = 1,2,3. The fraction fk of so-called interlayer particles is then f1 = (0.28,0.45), f2 = (0.05,0.13) and f3 = (0.02,0.03) for our two state-points, showing, perhaps surprisingly, that the denser state contains more interlayer particles caused by the smaller σ. We also calculated the pair distribution of the interlayer particles (not shown), revealing a higher contact value than that of the bulk smectic phase, suggesting substantial clustering of interlayer particles despite their low concentration fkη. Stringlike clusters composed of [formula] interlayer rods can indeed be identified, as shown for δ = 2σ by the size distribution P(n) in Fig. 3. Our (rather stringent) cluster criterion is such that two interlayer particles belong to the same cluster if the z and xy distance are smaller than h and D, respectively. At η1, one deduces from P(n) that [formula] of the clusters consist mostly of 2 or 3 rods, while clusters of more than 5 rods are rare but do exist. The denser smectic phase has larger clusters, which is again similar to supercooled liquids and glassy systems, in which the cluster size increases with increasing cage-trapping [\cite=donati] [\cite=berthier]. The fit [formula] is accurate with α = (1.5,0.7) at η1 and η2, respectively, from which the average cluster size follows as 〈n〉 = (1 -  exp ( - α))- 1. These results depend, however, strongly on δ as revealed by the inset of Fig. 3.

With all these resemblances to glassy dynamics we now study the dynamics of the layer-to-layer diffusion, for which Fig. 4b shows some typical trajectories. Most of the rods "jump" fast compared to the dwelling time within a smectic layer. Some rods diffuse to the inter-layer spacing and return to their original layer (yellow trajectory), others move from one layer to another several times (blue), in some cases the dwelling time in the inter-layer spacing is quite long (cyan), while double jumps can be also observed (pink). These observations suggest a rather broad distribution of jump-times tJ to diffuse from one layer to the next, where tJ is defined as the time span between first and last "contact" with the new and old layer, respectively, with contact established if the rod is at a distance δ from the middle of a smectic layer. At η1 and for δ = 2σ, the distribution of jump-times Π(tJ) as obtained by averaging over many trajectories is plotted in Fig. 4a, and shows that the most-probable jump-time is 0.14τ, the median is at t*J = 0.2τ, while the distribution extends over two decades 0.01 < tJ  /  τ < 1. Having developed a sense of time, we can characterize the trajectories further. We distinguish single and multiple jumps, depending on the dwelling time in the next layer being longer or shorter, respectively, than t*J before another jump is started. At η1 we find that ≈  5% of the total number of jumps is multiple, of which ≈  83% is a double and the remaining fraction a triple jump. At η2, where t*J = 0.27τ, the fraction of multiple jumps is 0.6%. The inter-layer rods are generally oriented along n̂. Remarkably, however, at η1 also transversely oriented rods in between two smectic layers have occasionally been observed [\cite=vanroij] [\cite=vanduijneveldt], which diffuse either to a new layer or return to the original one by rotating parallel or anti-parallel to their original orientation.

With our clear evidence for heterogeneous dynamics and spatial correlations between the fast-moving interlayer particles, it seems natural to investigate dynamic cooperativity, i.e., whether or not the stringlike clusters observed in static configurations actually move collectively. This requires a cluster criterion that not only involves spatial but also temporal proximity to identify collectively moving rods. Two jumping rods i and j are considered to move cooperatively if their arrival times t(i) and t(j) in their new layers (i.e. the first time at which their distance to the middle of the new layer equals δ) satisfies |t(i) - t(j)| < Δt, while [formula] and [formula] satisfy our static spatial cluster criterion. Using δ = 2σ and Δt = τ (i.e. long enough for any jump to finish according to Π(tJ)), we find at η1 that the number of collective jumps is ≈  25% of the total number of jumps, and involves mainly 2 (≈  79%) or 3 (≈  17%), and very rarely ≥  4 (< 4%) rods. Interestingly, ≈  42% of the collective jumps involve rods diffusing in opposite directions. These characteristic values are insensitive to small modifications of our spatial cluster criterion, while a smaller temporal interval of Δt  =  t*J (the median jump time) reduces the fraction of collective jumps to ≈  9%. In other words, the motion is indeed strongly cooperative at η1. If the analogy with glassy systems would hold even further, one would expect more cooperativity at η2. Surprisingly, perhaps, despite the larger static clusters we find less collective motion at η2. For instance, with δ = 2σ and Δt = 1.2τ (maximal jump time) only ≈  4% of the jumps can now be regarded as collective (involving essentially only 2 rods). We attribute this reduction of cooperativity upon approaching crystallization to the higher permanent barriers that reduce the probability of static clusters to actually complete their attempted jumps. Such permanent barriers do not exist in undercooled liquids (where the dynamic cluster size grows upon approaching the glass transition [\cite=donati] [\cite=berthier]), whereas they do exist in crystals, where structural relaxation is virtually non-existent.

In conclusion, for equilibrium hard rods in the smectic phase we find non-gaussian and cooperative relaxation behavior that is surprisingly similar to that of non-equilibrium supercooled liquids. We attribute the non-gaussian diffusion to the spatial inhomogeneous density of the smectic phase, and connect this to dynamic heterogeneities and to static clusters of inter-layer rods. Interestingly, we also find clear evidence for cooperative motion of stringlike clusters. Our results might be relevant for dynamics in other inhomogeneous liquids, e.g., confined fluids (micro and nanofluidic devices) [\cite=mittal] and columnar liquid crystals.
