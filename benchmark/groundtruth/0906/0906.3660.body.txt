A ρ- invariant of iterated torus knots

Introduction

A von Neumann ρ- invariant (also called L2-signature, or L2-eta invariant) of a real closed 3-manifold M is a real number ρφ(M) associated to every representation φ:π1(M)  →  Γ, where Γ is any group satisfying PTFA condition (see [\cite=COT1]). As a special case, if K is a knot in a 3-sphere, and we consider representations of the fundamental group of the manifold S30(K) (i.e. a zero surgery on K), then we can talk about the ρ-invariants of knots. In particular, the representation [formula], given by abelianization, gives rise to the representation [formula] and the corresponding invariant, ρab(K), turns out to be the integral over normalised unit circle of the Tristram-Levine signature of a knot.

The ρ- invariants for knots have been introduced first in [\cite=ChG]. They were then deeply studied in [\cite=COT1]. In their seminal paper, the authors observed that they are a very subtle obstruction for some knots to be slice. Namely, let us be given a knot K bounding a disk D in the ball B4. Let [formula], where ν denotes the tubular neighbourhood. Then Y is canonically isomorphic to S30(K), and, for any representation φ:π1(Y)  →  Γ that can be extended to [formula], the corresponding ρ- invariant must vanish. This allows to construct examples of non-slice knots, undistinguishable from slice knots by previously known methods as the Tristram-Levine signature or the Casson-Gordon invariants.

The difficulty of computability of ρ- invariants is the cost of their subtlety. Only in the first nontrivial case of the representation given by ab, there is a general method of computing this invariant, namely integrating the Tristram-Levine signature. In papers [\cite=COT2], [\cite=Ha], and others, these invariants were computed also for some other representations of the knot group. But there, the choice of knots is very specific.

In this paper we focus on ρab-invariant and compute it for all iterated torus knots. The computation consists of integrating the Tristram-Levine signature, which is not a completely trivial task. In fact, we do even more: we compute the Fourier transform of the Tristram-Levine signature function of iterated torus knot. This transform can be expressed by a surprisingly simple formula. In particular, this method can be used to detect knots, which are connected sums of iterated torus knots and which have identical Tristram-Levine signature.

What we find most interesting and striking about ρab of algebraic knots, is its relation with deep algebro-geometrical invariants of the plane curve singularity. We state this relation, in terms of a uniform bound (see Proposition [\ref=bound]) but, honestly speaking, we are far from understanding it. Moreover, this relation is not that clear for algebraic links, as we show on an example.

The structure of the paper is the following. In Section 2 we recall, how to compute the Tristram-Levine signature for iterated torus knots and formulate Theorem [\ref=core]. Then we deduce some of its corollaries. In Section 3 we prove Theorem [\ref=core]. In Section 4 we recall definitions of some invariants of plane curve singularities and compare them to ρab for algebraic knots. We end this section by computing the ρab for a (d,d) torus link, i.e., the link of singularity xd - yd = 0.

We apologise the reader for not giving a definition of the ρ- invariant. A precise definition from scratch, including necessary definitions of twisted signature of a 4 - manifold, would make this paper twice as long. Instead we refer to [\cite=COT1], or, for more detailed treatment, to a book by Lück [\cite=Lu].

We end this introduction by remarking that the ρ invariants were also studied in the context of mixed Hodge structures of hypersurface singularities. The η invariant, defined, for instance, in [\cite=Ne1], is closely related to the ρab invariant in the case of plane curve singularities. We refer to [\cite=Ne2] [\cite=Ne3] for the detailed study of this invariant.

Tristram-Levine signature of torus knots

We begin this section with some definitions, which we give also to fix the notation used in the article.

A knot is called an iterated torus knot if it arises from an unknot by finitely many cabling operations. An iterated torus knot is of type [formula] if it is a (p1,q1) cable of (p2,q2) cable of of (pn,qn) cable of an unknot. Fore example, a torus knot Tp,q is an iterated torus knot of type (p,q).

Let K be a knot, S its Seifert matrix. Let [formula], |ζ| = 1. The Tristram-Levine signature, σK(ζ) is the signature of the hermitian form given by

[formula]

It is well-known that the form [\eqref=eq:TLSig] is degenerate (i.e. has non-trivial kernel) if and only if ζ is a root of the Alexander polynomial ΔK of K. The function ζ  →  σK(ζ) is piecewise constant with possible jumps only at the roots of the Alexander polynomial ΔK(ζ). The value of σK at such root can a priori be different then left or right limit of σK at that point. However, there are only finitely many such values and they do not influence the integral. As we do not want to take care of this values, we introduce a very handy notion.

We shall say that two piecewise-constant functions from a unit circle (or a unit interval) to real numbers are almost equal if they are equal at all but finitely many points.

We would like to compute ρab for an iterated torus knot. We will use Proposition 5.1 from [\cite=COT2], which we can formulate as follows.

For any knot K  ⊂  S3 we have

[formula]

Therefore, what we have to do, is to compute the integral of the Tristram-Levine signature for an iterated torus knot. We begin with recalling results from [\cite=Li], where the function σK is computed for iterated torus knots.

Let p,q be coprime positive integers. Let x be in the interval

[formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=core]

To make computations at least a bit more transparent, let us first assume that r = 1. The function sp,q can be expressed as the sum

[formula]

where [formula] is the characteristic function of the interval (a,b). Therefore

[formula]

We have

[formula]

The internal sum on the right hand side is the sum of geometric series (here we use the assumption that β is not an integer) and can be expressed as

[formula]

where lk satisfies

[formula]

So we have

[formula]

The first sum in the denominator is again a geometric series. As to the second one, let us denote

[formula]

Then γk's have the following obvious properties

γk's are all different;

[formula];

each γk is of the form 1 + ak / pq with ak an integer.

By the Dirichlet principle the set [formula] is the same as the set [formula]. Therefore, the second sum in the denominator [\eqref=eq:twosums], upon reordering, can be expressed as

[formula]

which again is a geometric series. Putting things all together we get

[formula]

On the other hand, we have

[formula]

and the sum on the right hand side is just [\eqref=eq:universalsum] with -  β substituted in place of β. Substituting this into [\eqref=eq:whatwewant], and applying the formula [formula] several times, we arrive finally at

[formula]

To conclude the proof in the case r > 1 we observe that

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

Now, for fixed α we have

[formula]

Therefore, returning to [\eqref=eq:involvedsum] we get

[formula]

We can use [\eqref=eq:universalsum] again, substituting β / r in place of β. Similarly we can deal with a sum of terms eπiβ(1 - α / r - k / r). Now straightforward but long computations yield the formula [\eqref=eq:formula1].

Relation with algebraic invariants

The setup in this section is the following. Let [formula] be germ of a plane curve singularity with one branch. This means that there exists a local parametrisation C = (x(t),y(t)), with x and y analytic functions in one variable with x(0) = y(0) = 0. Let us assume that the Puiseux expansion of y in fractional powers of x written is the multiplicative form (see [\cite=EN]) is

[formula]

with q1 > p1 (otherwise we switch x with y), gcd (qi,pi) = 1 and pi,qi > 0. The pairs [formula] are called characteristic pairs (or Newton pairs) of the singularity. They completely determine the topological type of the singular point.

Put a1 = q1 and ak + 1 = pk + 1pkak + qk + 1. Then the link of the singularity (C,0) is an iterated torus knot. More precisely, it is a (pn,an) cable on (pn - 1,an - 1) cable on [formula] on (p1,a1) torus knot

The ordering of cables in [\cite=EN] is different than in [\cite=Li]. According to Definition [\ref=iterdef], the link of the singuarity (C,0) above would be an iterated torus knot of type [formula].

The ρab invariant of an algebraic knot is equal to

[formula]

It is on purpose that we wrote formula [\eqref=eq:tlint] in a different shape that in Corollary [\ref=corcore].

Let us now resolve the above singularity. This means that we have a map π:(X,E)  →  (U,0), where U is a neighbourhood of 0 in [formula], E is the exceptional divisor and X is a complex surface. We require the strict transform C' to be smooth, [formula] to have only normal crossings as singularities and the resolution to be minimal, so that we cannot blow-down any exceptional curve without violating one of the two above assumptions.

Put K = KX the canonical divisor on X and let D = C' + Ered. Here, the subscript 'red' means that we take a reduced divisor, i.e. coefficients with all components are equal to 1.

Using the notation from this section, we have

[formula]

where (K + D)2 denotes the self-intersection of the divisor K + D, and [formula].

On the one hand (K + D)2 has a very natural meaning. Namely, at least for unibranched singularities, this is the sum of the Milnor number μ and so called [formula] number of singularity. The latter, introduced in [\cite=Or] and studied in [\cite=BZ], can be interpreted as a parametric codimension of a singular point, i.e. the number of locally independent conditions, which are imposed on a curve given in parametric form, by the appearance of the singularity of given topological type.

On the other hand there is an apparent similarity of left hand sides of formulae [\eqref=eq:tlint] and [\eqref=eq:Mbar]. To make it even more similar, let us take a Zariski-Fujita [\cite=Fuj] decomposition of the divisor K + D. We have then

[formula]

with H nef (its intersection with any algebraic curve in X is non-negative), N effective and N2 < 0, H  ·  N' = 0 for any N' supported on [formula].

[formula]

In the case of unibranched singularity, the quantity H2 is the sum of Milnor number and so called M-number (without a bar) of singular point. Its importance lies in the fact that the sum of M-numbers of all singular points of an algebraic curve in [formula] can be bounded from above by global topological data of the curve, as genus and first Betti number (see [\cite=BZ]). These bounds involve very deep Bogomolov-Miyaoka-Yau inequality from algebraic geometry.

Thus the following result seem to be a very mysterious and shows a deep link between knot theory and algebraic geometry.

Let ρab be the integral of the Tristram-Levine signature of an algebraic knot (see [\eqref=eq:tlint]) and H2 be like in [\eqref=eq:H]. Then

[formula]

It easy to observe that

[formula]

On the one hand

[formula]

Recall that ak + 1 = akpk + 1pk + qk + 1, so ak + 1pk + 1 > akpkp2k + 1  ≥  4akpk. Hence

[formula]

But a1p1  ≥  6, so one inequality is proved.

To prove in the second one, let us reorganise terms of Δ as follows

[formula]

But

[formula]

We end up the chapter with the simplest example of multibranched singularity, i.e. with a singularity defined locally by xd - yd = 0 with d  ≥  2. Its link at singularity is the torus link Td,d. Let us consider a set

[formula]

Here the element k / d appears in Σd precisely d - 1 - |d - 1 - k| times, according to possible presentations k = i + j, 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  d - 1. Let sd(x) be the function computing the elements of Σd in (x,x + 1) with a '-  ' sign and the others with '+  ' sign. Then sd is almost equal to the Tristram-Levine signature of link Td,d. We have the formula

[formula]

The final term, - (d - 1), comes from the d - 1 elements of the set Σd of type d / d. They belong to any interval (x,x + 1). Thus, the integral of sd is equal to

[formula]

But an elementary calculus shows that

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

On the other hand, in order to resolve the singularity of C we need only one blow-up. The exceptional divisor E consists of single rational curve with E2 =  - 1. Then K = KX  =  αE and C' = βE (as E spans second (co)homology of blown-up space) and K(K + E) =  - 2 by genus formula, so K = E and C'  ·  E = d, so C' =  - d  ·  E. Thus K + D = K + C' + E = (2 - d)E. Moreover, this divisor is nef, so its Zariski-Fujita decomposition is trivial, H = (2 - d)E, N = 0, so in this case

[formula]

This shows that, in case of general links, a trivial analogue of Proposition [\ref=bound] does not hold.
