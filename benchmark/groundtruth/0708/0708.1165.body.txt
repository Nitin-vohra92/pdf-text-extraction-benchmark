Lieb-Thirring inequalities with improved constants

Introduction

Let H be a Schrödinger operator in [formula]

[formula]

For a real-valued potential V we consider Lieb-Thirring inequalities for the negative eigenvalues {λn} of the operator H

[formula]

where V+  =  (|V|  +  V) / 2 is the positive part of V.

Eden and Foias have obtained in [\cite=EF] a version of a one-dimensional generalised Sobolev inequality which gives best known estimates for the constants in the inequality [\eqref=LTh] for 1  ≤  γ < 3 / 2. The aim of this short article is to extend the method from [\cite=EF] to a class of matrix-valued potentials. By using ideas from [\cite=LW] this automatically improves on the known estimates of best constants in [\eqref=LTh] for multidimensional Schrödinger operators.

Lieb-Thirring inequalities for matrix-valued potentials for the value γ = 3 / 2 were obtained in [\cite=LW] and also in [\cite=BL]. Here we state a result corresponding to γ = 1.

Let V  ≥  0 be a Hermitian m  ×  m matrix-function defined on [formula] and let λn be all negative eigenvalues of the operator [\eqref=H]. Then

[formula]

The constant [formula] should be compared with the Lieb-Thirring constant found in [\cite=LT] for a class of single eigenvalue potentials and with the constant obtained in [\cite=HLW] which is twice as large as the semi-classical one This is about [formula].

Note that the values of the best constants for the range 1 / 2 < γ < 3 / 2 remain unknown.

Let [formula] be a magnetic vector potential with real valued entries [formula] and let where V  ≥  0 is a real-valued function.

Denote the ratio of [formula] and the semi-classical constant by

By using the Aizenmann-Lieb argument [\cite=AL], a "lifting" with respect to dimension [\cite=LW], [\cite=HLW], and Theorem [\ref=1D-matrix-LTh] we obtain the following result:

For any γ  ≥  1 and any dimension d  ≥  1, the negative eigenvalues of the operator H(A) satisfy inequalities where

Theorem [\ref=d-LTh] allows us to improve on the estimates of best constants in Lieb-Thirring inequalities for Schrödinger operators with complex-valued potentials recently obtained in [\cite=FLLS].

One-dimensional generalised Sobolev inequality for matrices

Let {φn}Nn = 0 be an ortho-normal system of vector-functions in [formula], [formula], where δnm is the Kronecker symbol. Let us introduce an M  ×  M matrix U with entries Clearly

[formula]

The fact that the functions φn are orthonormal can be written in a compact form

[formula]

The latter two properties [\eqref=P*=P] and [\eqref=PP=P] prove that U(x,y) could be considered as the integral kernel of an orthogonal projection P in [formula] whose image is the subspace of vector-functions spanned by {φn}Nn = 1.

Let us assume that the vector-function φn, [formula] are from the Sobolev class [formula]. Then

[formula]

By integrating [\eqref=UUU] and taking absolute values one obtains

[formula]

and

[formula]

Taking absolute values and adding the two inequalities yields for any [formula]

[formula]

Note that we have reproved Agmon's inequality

[formula]

for traces of matrices. By using properties of traces, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for matrix-functions and also properties [\eqref=P*=P] and [\eqref=PP=P], we find that for all [formula]

[formula]

and similarly

[formula]

Thus, using this, and setting x = z in [\eqref=int++UUU], we arrive at Integrating with respect to x we finally obtain

[formula]

which completes the proof.

Lieb-Thirring inequalities for Schrödinger operators with matrix-valued potentials

Let us assume that [formula], [formula], be a M  ×  M Hermitian matrix-valued potential with entries {vij}Mi,j = 1. Then the negative spectrum of the Schrödinger operator [formula] in [formula] is finite.

Denote by {φn} the ortho-normal system of eigen-vector functions corresponding to the eigenvalues {λn}Nn = 1 Clearly, and by Hölder's inequality for traces, so that using Theorem [\ref=1D-Sobolev] with [formula]. Minimising the right hand side with respect to X we finally complete the proof of Theorem [\ref=1D-matrix-LTh]
