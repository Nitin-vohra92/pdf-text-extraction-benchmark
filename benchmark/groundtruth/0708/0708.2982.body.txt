ILC Positron Production Target Simulation

Positron Sources

Currently two scenarios are considered to generate polarized positrons for the ILC. Both are utilizing low energy circularly polarized photons and high energy electrons to boost these photons to MeV energies and then convert them into electron-positron pairs. Each method named after the photon source as undulator [\cite=Alexander:2003fh] or laser [\cite=Sakaue:2007zr] based positron production. In this study [\cite=url] we will vary thickness and material of the production target to optimize the positron yield and polarisation.

Simulation Tools and Considered Polarized Processes

To achieve high number of positrons the target should be thick, of the order of one radiation length, 1X0 hence, the MeV photons may initiate showers, or at least 2-3 generations of particles and we would need a proper tracking tool like EGS or GEANT. To address the polarisation issue one have to take care also about the polarisation tracking. This has been incorporated into the EGS by K. Flöttmann [\cite=floettmann] and into the GEANT-4 by DESY-Zeuthen E166 group [\cite=Geant4:PhysRefMan]. Here we will use GEANT-3 [\cite=g3manual] modified in a way to account polarisation transfer in the processes summarized in table [\ref=tab1]. For the multiple scattering and dE / dX energy loss continuous approximations there are certain difficulties to treat the depolarisation especially for energies below the critical EC and this is mostly because lack of the theoretical and experimental input. Anyhow, for our calculations we use straight trajectory/no depolarisation for the dE / dX loss and (q +  cos θ) / (1 + q cos θ) approximation as depolarisation factor for a θ multiple scattering angle with q = (γ2 - 1) / (γ2 + 1) where γ is the Lorentz factor.

Results

One example of the simulation outcome for a 0.2X0 tungsten is shown on Figure [\ref=Fig:1] where initial photons originate from a helical 1m long undulator with k=0.19 on a 46.6 GeV energy electron beam (E166 experiment configuration). On the lower right figure one can find also total number of the positrons/electrons for the 109 simulated initial photons. Figure [\ref=Fig:2] displays results for the initial Compton photons produced by a 532 ~ nm laser, scattered on 1.3 GeV electrons with a crossing angle of 8 deg. Number of simulated Compton events is 107. Using positrons intensity dN / dE and polarisation P distributions we can form a product P2dN / dE (Figure [\ref=Fig:3]) to serve as a figure of merit for the target material and thickness optimization.

Optimal Target

To choose best production target we try tungsten and titanium changing their thickness by 0.04X0 steps, each time recording the positrons yield, polarisation and energy at the maximum figure of merit. Resulting numbers are displayed on Figure [\ref=Fig:4] and Figure [\ref=Fig:5] for the undulator and laser case respectively.

One can note that in general the positron polarisation depends weekly on the target thickness i.e. the target optimization could be done by maximizing only the positron yield. The distributions also indicate that the tungsten is preferable with a thickness of 0.3X0 for the undulator and 0.7X0 for the laser case.

Summary

In addition to the existing MC programs GEANT-3 is modified to count the polarisation. For energies lower than the critical, calculation errors could be large, special attention deserve multiple scattering and continuous energy loss.

For the target choice polarized calculations could almost be escaped, its sufficient to maximize the positron yield.
