On minimal norms on Mn

Introduction

Let Mn denote the algebra of all n  ×  n complex matrices A with entries in [formula] together with the usual matrix operations. By an algebra norm (or a matrix norm) we mean a norm [formula] on Mn such that [formula] for all A,B∈Mn. It is easy to see that the norm [formula] is an algebra norm, but the norm [formula] is not an algebra norm, see [\cite=H-M-M].

Let [formula] and [formula] be two norms on [formula]. Then the norm [formula] on Mn defined by [formula] is called the generalized induced (or g-ind) norm constructed via [formula] and [formula]. If [formula], then [formula] is called an induced norm.

It is known that [formula] and the spectral norm [formula] are induced by [formula] and [formula], respectively; cf. [\cite=H-J]. Recall that the [formula]-norm (1  ≤  p  ≤    ∞  ) on [formula] is defined by

[formula]

It is known that the algebra norm [formula] is not induced and it is not hard to show that it is not g-ind too; cf. Corollary 3.2.6 of [\cite=B-L].

A norm N(  ·  ) on Mn is called minimal if for any norm |||  ·  ||| on Mn satisfying |||  ·  |||  ≤  N(  ·  ) we have |||  ·  ||| = N(  ·  ). It is known [\cite=B-L] that an algebra norm is an induced norm if and only if it is a minimal element in the set of all algebra norms. Note that a generalized induced norm may not be minimal. For instance, put [formula] and [formula]. Then [formula] but [formula].

In [\cite=H-M-M], the authors investigate generalized induced norms. In particular, they examine the problem that "for any norm [formula] on Mn, there are two norms [formula] and [formula] on [formula] such that [formula] for all A∈Mn?" In this short note, we utilize some ideas of [\cite=H-M-M] to study the minimal norms on Mn. More precisely, we show that for each minimal norm N(  ·  ) on the algebra Mn of all n  ×  n complex matrices, there exists norms [formula] and [formula] on [formula] such that [formula] for all A∈Mn. In particular, if N(  ·  ) is an algebra norm, then [formula]. This may be regarded as an extension of the above known result on characterization of minimal algebra norms.

Main Result

For [formula] and 1  ≤  j  ≤  n, let Cx,j∈Mn be defined by the operator Cx,j(y) = yjx. Hence Cx,j is the n  ×  n matrix with x in the j column and 0 elsewhere. Define Cx∈Mn by [formula]. Hence Cx is the n  ×  n matrix whose all columns are x.

If [formula] is a generalized induced norm on Mn obtained via [formula] and [formula] then [formula], where [formula].

To achieve our goal, we need the following lemmas.

[\cite=H-M-M] Let [formula] and [formula] be two norms on [formula]. Then [formula] is an algebra norm on Mn if and only if [formula].

[\cite=H-M-M] [formula] if and only if there exists γ > 0 such that [formula] and [formula].

Let N(  ·  ) be a minimal norm on Mn, then [formula] for some [formula] and [formula] on [formula]. Moreover, if N(  ·  ) is an algebra norm, then [formula].

For [formula], set

[formula]

and

[formula]

We shall show that [formula] and [formula] are norms on [formula].

To see [formula] is a norm, let [formula]. Then [formula] if and only if N(CAx) = 0 for all matrix A with N(A) = 1, and this holds if and only if Ax = 0 for all A, or equivalently x = 0.

For [formula] and [formula], we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

To see [formula] is a norm, let [formula]. Then [formula] if and only if Cx = 0 and this holds if and only if x = 0.

For [formula] and [formula], we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

Now let [formula]. Then [formula]. So that

[formula]

whence

[formula]

Therefore [formula]. Since N(  ·  ) is a minimal norm, we conclude that [formula].

If N(A) is an algebra norm, then Lemma [\ref=lem1] implies that [formula].

Next let A∈Mn. It follows from [formula] that [formula]. In a similar fashion one can get

[formula]

By the minimality of [formula] we deduce that [formula]. It then follows from Lemma [\ref=lem2] that [formula].
