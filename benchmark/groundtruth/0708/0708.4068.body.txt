Boundaries for algebras of holomorphic functions on Banach spaces

Introduction and preliminaries

Let X be a complex Banach space and let BX be the closed unit ball of X. We denote by H(BX) the set of all holomorphic functions on the interior of BX, and by Cb(BX) the Banach algebra of bounded continuous functions on BX with the sup norm.

Globevnik [\cite=G1] defined and studied the following analogues of the classical disc algebra:

[formula]

It is shown in [\cite=ACG] that Au(BX) is a proper subset of Ab(BX) if and only if X is an infinite dimensional Banach space. Then it is easy to see that both Ab(BX) and Au(BX) are Banach algebras when given the natural norm

[formula]

Let K be a Hausdorff topological space and A a closed function algebra on K, that is, a closed subalgebra of Cb(K). A subset F of K is called a boundary for A if for all f∈A we have

[formula]

If the intersection of all closed boundaries for A is again a boundary for A, then it is called the Shilov boundary for A, denoted by ∂A. We recall that a function algebra A is said to be separating if (i) for two distinct points x,y in K, there is an element f∈A such that f(x)  ≠  f(y) and (ii) for each t∈K there is a f∈A such that f(t)  ≠  0. A uniform algebra on a compact Hausdorff space K is a closed function algebra which contains constants and separates the points of K.

Given a closed function algebra A on a metric space K, a set S  ⊂  K is called a peak set for A if there exists f∈A such that [formula]. A set S  ⊂  K is called a strong peak set for A if there exists f∈A such that f(S) = 1 and for every ε > 0 there exists δ > 0 with |f(x)| < 1 - δ whenever dist(x,S) > ε. If S consists of only one point p and if it is a peak set (resp. strong peak set) for A, then the point p is called a peak point (resp. strong peak point) for A.

The set of all peak points for A is called the Bishop boundary for A and denoted by ρA. Note that if K is compact, then a peak point x∈K for A is also a strong peak point for A, hence every closed boundary for A contains ρA. Further, Bishop [\cite=B] showed that for any uniform algebra A on a compact metrizable space K,

[formula]

Given a convex set M  ⊂  X, a point x∈M is called a real (resp. complex) extreme point of M if for every nonzero y∈X, there is a real (resp. complex) number ζ such that |ζ|  ≤  1 and x + ζy∉M. The set of all real (resp. complex) extreme points of M is denoted by [formula] (resp. [formula]). Let A be a uniform algebra on a compact Hausdorff space K. Let A* be the dual Banach space of A and let S*1 be the intersection of the unit sphere SA* of A* with the hyperplane {x*∈A*:x*(1)  =  1}. The set [formula] is called the Choquet boundary for A.

It is well-known (see [\cite=L]) that if A is a uniform algebra on a compact metrizable space K, then

[formula]

Given a convex compact subset K in a complex locally convex space E, Arenson [\cite=A] considered the uniform algebra P(K) generated by the constants and restrictions to K of functions from E*, and showed that

[formula]

In particular, if K is metrizable, we have

[formula]

On the other hand, it is shown in [\cite=G1] that [formula]. We also note that every closed boundary for a function algebra A must contain the set of all strong peak points for A.

When X is finite dimensional, we get the following observation from the above and ρP(BX)  ⊂  ρAb(BX).

If X is finite dimensional, then

[formula]

and

[formula]

The following two observations are easy.

Let X be a Banach space and suppose that the set of all strong peak points for Au(BX) is dense in the unit sphere SX. Then the unit sphere is the Shilov boundary for both Au(BX) and Ab(BX).

Let X be a Banach space and suppose that the unit sphere SX is the Shilov boundary for Au(BX). Then a subset F of BX is a boundary for Au(BX) if and only if it is a boundary for Ab(BX).

For each x∈BX, we call the set F(x) the face at x, which is defined by

[formula]

Notice that x∈SX is a complex extreme point of BX if and only if F(x) = {x}. A Banach space X is said to be strictly c-convex if every point of SX is a complex extreme point.

By the maximum modulus theorem, we obtain the following

Let S be a peak set for Ab(BX). Then for each x∈S, F(x) is contained in S.

This shows that every peak point for Ab(BX) is a complex extreme point of BX, which is Theorem 4 in [\cite=G2].

A point x∈SX is said to have a strong face if for each ε > 0, there is δ(ε) > 0 such that if dist(F(x),y)  ≥  ε, then

[formula]

A Banach space X is said to be locally c-convex if it is strictly c-convex and every point of the unit sphere SX has a strong face. The maximum modulus theorem shows that if two elements x,y in a Banach space satisfy [formula], then [formula].

Suppose that X is a finite dimensional Banach space. Then every point of SX has a strong face.

Suppose otherwise. Then there exist x∈SX, ε > 0 and a sequence {yn} in X such that dist(F(x),yn)  ≥  ε for each n, but

[formula]

So we get

[formula]

Hence [formula]. So we may assume that yn converges to y. Then dist(F(x),y)  ≥  ε. For each [formula],

[formula]

This shows that

[formula]

Therefore, y  =  x + (y - x)∈F(x), which contradicts dist(F(x),y)  ≥  ε.

The modulus of complex convexity of a complex Banach space X is defined by

[formula]

for each ε > 0. A complex Banach space X is said to be uniformly c-convex if HX(ε) > 0 for all ε > 0. If X is uniformly c-convex, then every point in SX has a strong face. A finite dimensional strictly c-convex space is uniformly c-convex.

A sequence x = {x(k)} is said to be positive if x(k)  ≥  0 for each [formula]. We define a partial order x  ≥  y if x - y is positive. The absolute value of x is defined to be |x| = {|x(k)|}. A Banach sequence space [formula] is a Banach space consisting of sequences satisfying the following : if x is a sequence with |x|  ≤  |y| for some y∈X, then x∈X and [formula]. A Banach sequence space is said to be order continuous if any sequence {xn} in X satisfying

[formula]

is norm-convergent. The vector ej is defined to have 1 in the j-th component with all zeros in the other components. Note that if a Banach sequence space X is order continuous, then {en} is a basis of X.

It is known in [\cite=Lee] [\cite=Lee2] that a uniformly c-convex sequence space is order continuous.

A Banach sequence space X is said to be strictly monotone if for every pair y  ≥  x  ≥  0 with y  ≠  x, we have [formula]. Recall also that a Banach sequence space X is said to be lower (resp. upper) locally uniformly monotone if for any positive x∈SX and any 0 < ε < 1 (resp. ε > 0) there is δ  =  δ(ε,x) > 0 such that the condition 0  ≤  y  ≤  x (resp. y  ≥  0) and [formula] implies

[formula]

A Banach sequence space X is said to be uniformly monotone if given ε > 0, there is δ(ε) > 0 such that

[formula]

A uniformly monotone Banach sequence space is both lower and upper locally uniformly monotone.

It is shown in [\cite=FK] that a Banach sequence space is lower locally uniformly monotone if and only if it is strictly monotone and order continuous. It is also shown in [\cite=HN] [\cite=Lee] [\cite=Lee2] that a Banach sequence space is strictly (resp. uniformly) monotone if and only if it is strictly (resp. uniformly) c-convex.

Boundaries of Au(BX) and Ab(BX)

Suppose that X is a complex Banach space. Let F be a boundary for Au(BX) and let P be a norm-one projection with a finite dimensional range Y. Then

[formula]

Suppose [formula]. Then there exists ε0  >  0 such that [formula] for every x∈F. By Proposition  [\ref=finite] x0 is a strong peak point for the algebra Au(BY), that is, there is a g∈Au(BY) such that g(x0) = 1 and to every ε > 0 corresponds a δ(ε) > 0 satisfying

[formula]

for all y∈BY with [formula] Take [formula]. Then f(x0) = 1 and for every x∈F we have

[formula]

This contradicts the fact that F is a boundary of Au(BX).

Suppose that X is a complex Banach space with the following properties: There is a collection {Pα}α∈A of projections Pα with finite dimensional ranges Yα such that [formula] is dense in X, and for each α∈A

[formula]

Then a set F  ⊂  BX is a boundary for Au(BX) if

[formula]

for every α∈A.

Suppose that F is not a boundary for Au(BX). Then there are f∈Au(BX), [formula] and ε > 0 such that |f(x)| < 1 - ε for every x∈F. ρAu(BY) is a boundary for Au(BY) if Y is finite dimensional. Since [formula] is dense in BX, it follows from Proposition  [\ref=finite] that

[formula]

Hence there is a sequence {xn} such that

[formula]

Because f is continuous and [formula] for every α∈A, there is a sequence {un} such that

[formula]

Each un has the form un  =  Pαnzn where zn∈F. Set vn  =  (I - Pαn)zn, and zn  =  un  +  vn. By the uniform continuity of f there exists δ, 0 < δ < 1 such that if [formula] and x1,x2∈BX, then |f(x1)  -  f(x2)| < ε / 2. Thus we get for every [formula],

[formula]

Further, since zn = un  +  vn∈F, we have |f(un  +  vn)| < 1 - ε, and consequently for each [formula],

[formula]

On the other hand, since

[formula]

for every [formula], the maximum modulus theorem shows that for every [formula] with |ζ|  ≤  1,

[formula]

By [\cite=G1], there is C(ε) <   ∞   such that for each [formula],

[formula]

Since lim n|f(un)| = 1, it follows that lim n|f(un  +  (1 - δ)vn)| = 1, which contradicts ([\ref=eq:contra]).

Suppose that X is a complex Banach space with a sequence {Pn} of projections with the same properties as in Proposition [\ref=finitedimension]. Then a set F  ⊂  BX is a boundary for Au(BX) if and only if the closure of Pn(F) contains [formula] for every positive integer n.

We remark that an order continuous Banach sequence space has the properties outlined in Proposition [\ref=finitedimension].

Let X be an order continuous Banach sequence space. Let F  ⊂  SX and let Pn be a sequence of coordinate projections with finite dimensional range Yn such that every finite subset of [formula] is contained in the support of some Pn. If [formula] for each [formula], then F is a boundary for Au(BX).

Corollary [\ref=specialcase] extends Theorem 1.5 in [\cite=G1].

Suppose that there is a family {Yα}α∈A of finite dimensional subspaces of a Banach space X such that [formula] is dense in BX. Then the set [formula] is a boundary for Ab(BX).

Shilov Boundary for Au(BX) and Ab(BX)

Suppose that x0∈SX has a strong face and T is a bounded operator of X into X with Tx0 = x0 and

[formula]

Then for each ε > 0, there is δ(ε) > 0 such that whenever dist(F(x0),y)  ≥  ε and y∈BX, we get

[formula]

Suppose, on the contrary, that there is ε0 > 0 such that

[formula]

Then there is a sequence {sn} in BX such that dist(F(x0),sn)  ≥  ε0 and

[formula]

Since x0 has a strong face, there are δ1 > 0 and [formula] such that for every n, we have

[formula]

So

[formula]

This implies that

[formula]

which is a contradiction.

Let X be a complex Banach space and let P be a projection of X onto a finite dimensional subspace Y such that

[formula]

If [formula] and x0 has a strong face in X, then F(x0) is a strong peak set for Au(BX).

By Proposition  [\ref=finite], x0 is a strong peak point for Ab(BY) since Y is finite dimensional. Hence there is a peak function g∈Ab(BY) such that g(x0) = 1 and for each ε > 0 there is (ε) > 0 such that for every [formula] and y∈BY, we have

[formula]

By Proposition [\ref=strongface] we get δ(ε) > 0 such that if dist(F(x0),y)  ≥  ε

[formula]

Take [formula]. Then f∈Au(BX) and for each z∈BX with dist(F(x0),z)  ≥  ε, we have f(F(x0)) = 1 by the maximum modulus theorem and |f(z)| < 1 - (δ(ε)). This implies that F(x0) is a strong peak set for Au(BX).

Every element x in the torus in c0 has a strong face F(x) and hence F(x) is a strong peak set for Au(BX). The following generalizes Theorem 1.9 in [\cite=G1].

Let X be a complex Banach space as in Proposition [\ref=finitedimension]. Suppose that every point of [formula] has a strong face in X. Then F  ⊂  BX is a boundary for Au(BX) if and only if dist(F,S) = 0 for each strong peak set S for Au(BX).

The necessity is clear. Conversely, suppose that there is a subset F  ⊂  BX such that dist(F,S) = 0 for each strong peak set S for Au(BX). We shall show that for each α the closure of Pα(F) contains [formula]. By applying Proposition [\ref=finitedimension], we get the desired result.

Now, let [formula]. By Proposition [\ref=peakset], its face F(x0) is a strong peak set for Au(BX). Hence dist(F,F(x0)) = 0. Then there are sequences {x0  +  yk}k in F(x0) and {zk}k in F such that

[formula]

Since x0  +  yk is in F(x0) and [formula], we have for each real θ,

[formula]

Since xo is a complex extreme point of BYα, Pα(yk) = 0, and so ([\ref=eqlimitext]) shows that

[formula]

Therefore x0 is in the closure of Pα(F).

In the proof of Proposition [\ref=propboundarypeakset], it is sufficient for F  ⊂  BX to be a boundary for Au(BX) that dist(F,F(x)) = 0 holds for every [formula].

Let X be a locally c-convex sequence space. Suppose that x0∈SX is finitely supported. Then x0 is a strong peak point for Au(BX). In particular, if in addition, X is order continuous, then the set of all strong peak points for Au(BX) is dense in SX.

Suppose that [formula] contains x0. Hence x0 is a complex extreme point of BY. Let P:X  →  Y be the projection defined by

[formula]

Clearly [formula] for all [formula]. By Proposition [\ref=peakset], x0 is a strong peak point for Au(BX). Notice that if a Banach sequence space is order continuous, then the set of all finitely supported elements in X is dense in X.

Proposition [\ref=propinfinitedense] and Corollary [\ref=propz1001] show the following theorem.

Let X be an order continuous locally c-convex Banach space. Then SX is the Shilov boundary for both Au(BX) and Ab(BX).

By [\cite=Lee] [\cite=Lee2], every uniformly c-convex sequence space is order continuous.

A Banach sequence space X is upper locally uniformly monotone if and only if it is locally c-convex.

Suppose X is locally c-convex. Then for each positive x∈SX and ε > 0 there is δ  =  δ(x,ε) > 0 such that for all z∈X with [formula]

[formula]

Hence we have for every y  ≥  0 with [formula],

[formula]

So X is upper locally uniformly monotone.

Conversely, suppose that X is upper locally uniformly monotone. If x,y∈X, then by [\cite=DGT],

[formula]

By Lemma 2.3 in [\cite=Lee], for every nonzero pair x,y in X, there exist [formula] and z∈X with 0  ≤  z  ≤  |y| and [formula] such that the following holds:

[formula]

Hence for every x∈SX and ε > 0, we get

[formula]

Hence the upper local uniform monotonicity implies the local c-convexity. The proof is complete.

A function [formula] is said to be an Orlicz function if φ is even, convex continuous and vanishing only at zero. Let w = {w(n)} be a weight sequence ,that is, a non-increasing sequence of positive real numbers satisfying [formula]. Given a sequence x, x* is the decreasing rearrangement of |x|.

The Orlicz-Lorentz sequence space λφ,w consists of all sequences x = {x(n)} such that for some λ > 0,

[formula]

and equipped with the norm [formula], λφ,w is a Banach space. We say an Orlicz function φ satisfies the condition δ2 (φ∈δ2) if there exist K > 0, u0 > 0 such that φ(u0) > 0 and the inequality

[formula]

holds for u∈[0,u0].

It was proved in [\cite=FK] that the Orlicz-Lorentz sequence space λφ,w is strictly monotone if and only if it is both upper and lower locally uniformly monotone. They also showed that the strict monotonicity of λφ,w is equivalent to the fact that φ∈δ2. In this case, the Orlicz-Lorentz sequence space λφ,w is locally c-convex by Proposition [\ref=propmonotonecomplex] and order continuous by Theorem 2 and Corollary 4 of [\cite=FK]. If φ(u) = |u|p for some 1  ≤  p <   ∞   and if [formula], then [formula]. Hence we obtain the following corollary by Theorem [\ref=thmsilov] which extends a result in [\cite=ACLQ].

Given an Orlicz function φ∈δ2 and a weight sequence w,

[formula]

Boundaries for Ab(BX)

Recall that a Banach sequence space X is called rearrangement invariant if y∈X and [formula] whenever y is a sequence with y* = x* for some x∈X. Let X be a rearrangement invariant Banach sequence space. Given any finite subset M of natural numbers, let [formula] be the order preserving bijection and let PM be the isometry from [formula] onto X given by

[formula]

where the sum is a formal series and [formula] If [formula] is finite, x is called a finite vector. Now assume that X has the following additional property: For each finite vector x∈BX, there exist ε  =  ε(x) > 0 such that for all y∈BX with [formula],

[formula]

For each finite vector x∈SX, let η(x) > 0 be the supremum of the set of all ε > 0 satisfying ([\ref=eqspecicalcase]). Observe that η(x)  ≤  1 and

[formula]

If X is a rearrangement invariant Banach sequence space satisfying the property ([\ref=eqspecicalcase]) and if [formula], where F is the subspace spanned by a finite number of {ek}k, then for all y∈X with x + y∈F(x), we have

[formula]

Let S  ⊂  BX and let F be the subspace spanned by a finite number of {ek}k. Given x∈BF we define

[formula]

Put, for each 0 < ε < 1,

[formula]

Then S is called a 0-boundary for Ab(BX) if C(S,ε) < 1 for every ε > 0. A family {Sγ}γ∈Γ of subsets of BX is called a uniform family of 0-boundaries for Ab(BX) if sup γ∈ΓC(Sγ,ε) < 1 for every ε > 0.

Let X be a rearrangement invariant Banach sequence space satisfying property ([\ref=eqspecicalcase]) and let V be a boundary for Ab(BX) consisting of norm-one finite vectors. Assume also that S  ⊂  BX has the property that {S(x)}x∈V is a uniform family of 0-boundaries for Ab(BX). Then S is a boundary for Ab(BX).

Suppose S is not a boundary for Ab(BX). Then there is f∈Ab(BX) with [formula] and 0  <  δ  <  1 such that |f(z)| < 1 - δ for all z∈S. The assumption on V implies that there exists a sequence {xn}∞n = 1 in V such that

[formula]

For each [formula] [formula] is finite and there exists η(xn) > 0 such that for every y∈BX with [formula]

[formula]

Define φn on BX

[formula]

Then φn∈Ab(BX) and [formula] for all n. Moreover, for each x∈S(xn)

[formula]

and this contradicts the assumption that {S(x)}x∈V is a uniform family of 0-boundaries for Ab(BX).

We shall use the following two lemmas which are proved in [\cite=G1].

[\cite=G1] Let 0  ≤  r < 1 and assume {Sγ}γ∈Γ is a family of subsets of BX such that [formula] for each γ∈Γ. Then {Sγ}γ∈Γ is a uniform family of 0-boundaries for Ab(BX).

[\cite=G1] Let θ0 > 0 and let {Sγ}γ∈Γ be a family of subsets of BX with the following property: for each γ∈Γ there is some xγ∈Sγ such that eiθxγ∈Sγ for every |θ|  ≤  θ0. Then {Sγ}γ∈Γ is a uniform family of 0-boundaries for Ab(BX).

Theorem [\ref=Ab1-boundary] and Lemma [\ref=lemG1] show the following corollary.

Let X be a rearrangement invariant Banach sequence space satisfying property ([\ref=eqspecicalcase]) and let V be a boundary for Ab(BX) consisting of norm-one finite vectors. Assume that S  ⊂  BX and that there is 0  ≤  r  <  1 such that for each x∈V there exists y∈X such that

[formula]

Then S is a boundary for Ab(BX).

By Theorem [\ref=Ab1-boundary] and Lemma [\ref=lemG2], we get the following corollary.

Let X be a rearrangement invariant Banach sequence space satisfying property ([\ref=eqspecicalcase]) and let V be a boundary for Ab(BX) consisting of norm-one finite vectors. Assume that S  ⊂  BX and assume that there is θ0 > 0 such that for each x∈V there exists y∈BX such that

[formula]

Then S is a boundary for Ab(BX).

Assume that ψ  =  {ψ(n)} is an strictly increasing sequence with ψ(0) = 0, ψ(n)  >  0 for [formula]. The Marcinkiewicz sequence space mψ consists of all sequences x = {x(n)} such that

[formula]

Let m0Ψ be the closed subspace of mψ, equipped with the same norm [formula] consisting of all x∈mψ satisfying

[formula]

Without loss of generality we can add (and we will) in the above definition the assumption that the sequence [formula] is decreasing [\cite=KL]. Notice that if ψ(n) = n, then [formula] and m0ψ = c0, and if lim nψ(n) <   ∞  , then m0ψ  =  {0}.

It is shown in [\cite=KL1] that if lim nψ(n) =   ∞  , then for each x∈Bm0ψ, there exist [formula] and ε > 0 such that [formula] for all y∈Bmψ with [formula] and all λ with |λ|  ≤  ε. Now it is easy to see that m0ψ satisfies ([\ref=eqspecicalcase]) because m0ψ is a rearrangement invariant sequence space.
