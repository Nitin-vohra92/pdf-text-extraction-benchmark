Interaction between ionic lattices and superconducting condensates

Introduction

The theory of deformable superconductors deals either with effects of the lattice deformations on the superconducting condensate or with deformations of the crystal lattice driven by the inhomogeneous superconducting condensate. For example, a lattice deformation around a dislocation pins a vortex.[\cite=KB67] [\cite=L68] In contrary, forces generated by supercurrents contribute to the magnetostriction[\cite=IHNKK93] [\cite=NKGBGSM97] [\cite=CIL05] and a condensate depletion at the vortex core deforms the lattice so strongly that a significant renormalization of the vortex mass has been predicted.[\cite=Sim91] [\cite=DSim92] [\cite=C94] [\cite=CK03] In some cases one cannot say which of the two effects are dominant. This happens, for instance, if the ionic lattice deformation influences the structure or orientation of the Abrikosov vortex lattice.[\cite=KBMD95]

The free energy describing deformable superconductors has to include at least three parts. The first part is the elastic energy of deformations. Its structure and parametrization have well been established for a long time.[\cite=LL75] The second part is the magnetic energy and the energy of superconducting condensation. This part can be covered on different levels. Here we will refer to the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory[\cite=GL50] employed in the majority of the above mentioned studies. The third part is a cross term which describes the mutual effect of deformations and the condensate. In this paper we focus on this interaction term.

In the phenomenological approach put forward by Kramer and Bauer[\cite=KB67] the interaction of the lattice and the condensate is described by a local product of the lattice density with the density of superconducting electrons. If the lattice is modeled by an isotropic deformable medium and the interaction is assumed to be local, the interaction energy of Kramer and Bauer is the only one compatible with the system symmetry. Indeed, the condensate density is a scalar which can interact only with another scalar. The only isotropic scalar quantity linear in the deformation is the trace of the strain tensor, which is proportional to the ionic density. Of course, one can construct more elaborate scalars within non-linear terms but these are higher-order corrections.

Two modifications are at hand. First, one can take into account that the real lattice is never isotropic. Even in simplest lattices of elementary metals the shear rigidity depends on the orientation of the deformation with respect to the crystal axes. In the anisotropic crystal, there are two scalar quantities linear in the shear deformation. A corresponding anisotropic generalization of the interaction between the condensate and the ionic lattice has been discussed by Kogan et al.[\cite=KBMD95]

Second, one can go beyond the local approximation. The reason for such a step is the following. The interaction in the local approximation is justified only for neutral systems.[\cite=LL75] The superconducting condensate, however, drives the system out of neutrality inducing the electrostatic potential known as the Bernoulli potential.[\cite=BK68] [\cite=MB71] The non-local interaction mediated by the Bernoulli potential in the bulk of the superconductor has been discussed in our previous paper.[\cite=LMKB07]

Another contribution to the charge transfer induced by the condensate is the surface dipole.[\cite=LMKMBSa04] While all the above mentioned interactions result in a force density acting in the bulk of the crystal, the surface dipole yields the force which acts as an external pressure imposed on the surface. As far as we know, the surface dipole has never been discussed within the theory of deformable superconductors. In this paper we want to fill this gap.

The paper is organized as follows. In section II we show that the surface dipole determines changes of the crystal volume during its transition from the normal to the superconducting state. To this end we first introduce the basic concept in Sec. II.A and derive the coefficient of the local interaction from the pressure dependence of the condensation energy at zero temperature in Sec. II.B. The result is compared with the force due to the surface dipole in Sec. II.C. In section III we introduce the interaction mediated by the Bernoulli potential. We first derive a formula for the coefficient of the local interaction. In Secs. III.A and III.B we evaluate the interaction coefficient for moderately strong and weak coupling superconductors. In section IV we discuss differences and conclude.

Local approach

In their pioneering study Kramer and Bauer[\cite=KB67] proposed to deduce the interaction strength from the pressure dependence of the critical magnetic field Bc. Since experimental data for this parametrization are conveniently found in literature, this approach has been employed by other authors too.

In this section we provide a derivation of the local interaction of Kramer and Bauer within the GL picture of the superconductor. The presented approach is based on papers by Simánek[\cite=Sim91] and Hake.[\cite=H68]

Phenomenological force

The volume of a metal changes at the phase transition from Vn in the normal state to Vs in the superconducting state.[\cite=S52] [\cite=H68] This change is described by a relative change α of the specific volume defined as

[formula]

If the specific volume becomes inhomogeneous, the crystal has regions requiring different distances of neighboring atoms. This leads to internal stresses which can be expressed via an effective force density [\cite=LL75]

[formula]

where K is the modulus of hydrostatic compression or simply the bulk modulus. It is defined as the inverse of the relative volume change with respect to the pressure

[formula]

The temperature dependence of α is similar to the temperature dependence of the superconducting fraction

[formula]

where subscript zero denotes the zero temperature value. Simánek[\cite=Sim91] [\cite=DSim92] and Coffey[\cite=C94] [\cite=CK03] use the BCS gap Δ,

[formula]

while other authors prefer the GL function ψ. We will restrict our attention to the vicinity of the critical temperature, where both forms are equivalent since the BCS gap and the GL function are linearly proportional to each other.[\cite=Gor59]

Relation ([\ref=e2p2]) is the central approximation in the phenomenological theory of deformable superconductors. Assuming that in the normal state the system is homogeneous, α0 and ψ0 are constants. With the GL function normalized to the density of pair-able electrons 2|ψ0|2 = n, we obtain

[formula]

which we will use in our discussion.

Difference of normal and superconducting volume

Now we link the relative change of the specific volume α to the pressure dependence of the condensation energy εcon. We follow the derivation of Hake.[\cite=H68]

The volume of the sample is the pressure derivative at fixed temperature of the Gibbs free energy

[formula]

At zero magnetic field and zero temperature, the free energy of the normal state Gn is higher than the superconducting free energy Gs by the condensation energy

[formula]

Due to the complete expulsion of the magnetic field from type-I superconductors, the condensation energy is conveniently observed via the critical magnetic field at zero temperature

[formula]

In his study, Hake expresses all thermodynamical relations exclusively in terms of the critical magnetic field. Here we prefer to use the condensation energy.

>From the pressure derivative of the relation ([\ref=e4]) it follows

[formula]

Comparing the thermodynamical relation ([\ref=e5]) with the definition ([\ref=e1]) we obtain the coefficient α0 in terms of the condensation energy

[formula]

In terms of the bulk modulus ([\ref=e7]) we have

[formula]

The force ([\ref=e2]) depends on the product α0K, it is thus advantageous to introduce the inverse bulk modulus also into the first term of Eq. ([\ref=e9]). For simplicity we consider hydrostatic pressure and conventional superconductors with isotropic structure. In this case we can express the pressure dependence of the density of the condensation energy εcon via its dependence on the electron density,

[formula]

Since the number of electrons N does not change, we can express the bulk compressibility via the change of the density n = N / V as

[formula]

Using relation ([\ref=e10]) and the bulk modulus ([\ref=e8]) in equation ([\ref=e9]) we get

[formula]

The density derivative is taken under the condition of charge neutrality, i.e., the lattice density changes with the electron density.

The phenomenological force ([\ref=e2]) according to relation ([\ref=e13]) thus reads

[formula]

We will compare this form with the electrostatic force resulting from a surface dipole.

Compression via the surface dipole

At the surface of a metal the electrostatic potential rises by few Volts from its vacuum value to the value deep in the metal.[\cite=KW96] This increase is spread partly outside the region occupied by ions, typically on the scale of the tunneling length of electrons in the potential barrier given by the work function. A part of the barrier is located inside the metal on the scale of the Thomas-Fermi screening length. Both scales are of the order of Å ngstrø ms making the potential step very sharp. This sharp step is called the surface dipole.

The surface dipole naturally depends on the temperature. Moreover, when the metal undergoes a transition to the superconducting state, the temperature dependence of the surface dipole changes. Briefly, the superconducting condensate affects the surface dipole.[\cite=LMKMBSa04] Let us denote this additional potential near the surface as φT.

An amplitude φT(0) - φT(  ∞  ) of the additional potential step follows from the Budd-Vannimenus theorem as[\cite=LMKMBSa04]

[formula]

where f = fs - fn is the free-energy density by which the superconducting state differs from the normal state and where ρlat is the charge density of the ionic lattice. We assume a superconductor which fills the half-space x > 0.

The additional potential exerts an electrostatic force density on the ionic lattice

[formula]

The integral of this force density across the surface region corresponds to an effective pressure on the lattice

[formula]

which changes the volume of the crystal by

[formula]

Clearly, the surface dipole contributes to the relative change of the specific volume α̃. From ([\ref=e15d]) we find

[formula]

At zero temperature f =  - εcon, therefore from ([\ref=e15a]) it follows

[formula]

The dipole-induced volume change at zero temperature thus reads

[formula]

Comparing ([\ref=e15g]) with ([\ref=e13]) one can see that the volume change is fully induced by the surface dipole

[formula]

The fact that the volume change is driven by the surface dipole shows that one should be cautious using the relative change of the specific volume α0 as a coefficient of the interaction between the ionic lattice and the condensate.

Studies of the electrostatic potential in superconductors have shown that the bulk and surface potentials are of different nature and are covered by distinct theories. We note that these theories are experimentally verified. The surface potential including the surface dipole has been observed by Morris and Brown via the Kelvin capacitive pickup.[\cite=MB71] [\cite=LMKMBSa04] The internal charge transfer caused by the bulk electrostatic potential in the vortex core has been observed by Kumagai, Nozaki and Matsuda via the nuclear magnetic resonance.[\cite=KNM01] [\cite=LKMB02]

Electrostatic force on ions

According to the Hellmann-Feynman theorem, electrons act on ions exclusively via the electrostatic force. In this spirit, we expect the force density to be of electrostatic nature,

[formula]

where φ is the electrostatic potential created by the superconducting electrons which is conveniently derived following the approach of Rickayzen.[\cite=Ri69] Since the system is in equilibrium, the Gibbs electrochemical potential μ for electrons is constant all over the sample. It is locally defined from the density of free energy f as

[formula]

Following the customary choice in the theory of superconductivity we set the electrochemical potential to zero, μ = 0, therefore

[formula]

The theory of the electrostatic potential has been derived under the assumption that the ion lattice is stiff and its deformation is not included. A combination of both effects has not been studied so far, therefore it is not yet clear how the density derivative in ([\ref=e17]) is modified by lattice deformations. For simplicity we assume that the density derivatives in ([\ref=e17]) and in ([\ref=e15a]) are the same. This is the case if the pairing interaction has a purely electronic nature so that the lattice density has no effect on the condensation energy.

Formula ([\ref=e17]) is quite general. It has been employed by Rickayzen to evaluate the Bernoulli potential in superconductors using the London theory supplemented by the phenomenological temperature dependence of the superconducting density. In the same paper[\cite=Ri69] Rickayzen has used formula ([\ref=e17]) with the BCS free energy and recovered the result of Adkins and Waldram.[\cite=AW68]

We use the free-energy density in the GL approximation

[formula]

where [formula] is the vector potential and [formula] is the applied magnetic field. The reader not familiar with the GL theory is referred to the textbook[\cite=Tinkham] of Tinkham.

The magnetic free energy (the last term of ([\ref=e18])) does not depend on the electron density. For simplicity we also assume that the Cooper pair mass m* is independent of this density. Since the GL wave function ψ and the vector potential [formula] are independent variational fields, the density derivative of the free energy yields the electrostatic potential

[formula]

The nonlocal corrections discussed in Ref. [\cite=LMKB07] are hidden in the second and third terms of ([\ref=e19]). They can be made explicit using relations for material parameters a and b, e.g. ([\ref=e23]), and the GL equation, which couples nonlocal and nonlinear contributions.

Here we restrict our attention to a close vicinity of the critical temperature, where all nonlocal and nonlinear contributions can be neglected. Indeed, for T  →  Tc the GL wave function vanishes [formula]. In lowest order in T - Tc we can neglect the second and the quartic term so that relation ([\ref=e19]) simplifies to

[formula]

Now we are ready to evaluate the force acting on the ionic lattice. The electrostatic force density ([\ref=e15]) with the electrostatic potential ([\ref=e20]) reads

[formula]

In first order in Tc - T, gradients of material parameters a and ∂Tc  /  ∂n do not contribute, i.e.,

[formula]

We have used ρlat =  - en demanded by the local charge neutrality.

With nonlocal and nonlinear corrections neglected, the electrostatic force ([\ref=e22]) like the phenomenological force ([\ref=e14]) are proportional to the gradient of the superconducting density |ψ|2. Our next aim is to compare the electrostatic coefficient [formula] with its phenomenological precursor [formula]. We will show that the relative values of these coefficients depend on the strength of the pairing interaction.

Superconductors with moderately strong coupling

To be able to compare the electrostatic force density ([\ref=e22]) with the phenomenological force density ([\ref=e2]), we need the GL parameter a as function of the electron density n. For metals like niobium or lead, it is possible to use the asymptotic form of the two-fluid free energy of Gorter and Casimir [\cite=GC34] giving[\cite=LKMB01]

[formula]

Here γ is the linear coefficient of the specific heat.

The critical temperature Tc and the critical magnetic field B0 at zero temperature are linked via the condensation energy. The two-fluid model yields[\cite=B55]

[formula]

Within this approximation, the electrostatic force density ([\ref=e22]) reads

[formula]

One can see that this is similar but not identical to the phenomenological force density ([\ref=e14]). In particular, the same dominant term [formula] results from both approaches.

We note that Simánek and many of other authors use the approximation [formula], i.e., they consider only the derivative in their formulas. Within this accuracy both formulas are equivalent.

Superconductors with weak coupling

Metals like aluminum have weak electron-phonon coupling and one can use BCS relations. This approximation results in a slightly different electrostatic force.

>From the BCS theory Gor'kov has obtained parameters of the GL theory.[\cite=Gor59] The linear GL coefficient reads

[formula]

where EF is the Fermi energy. The Riemann Zeta function has the value ζ(3) = 1.202.

The BCS and the Gorter and Casimir approximations of a can be related within the free electron model. The electron density determines the Fermi vector kF = (3π2n)1 / 3 in terms of which EF  =  2k2F / 2m. We also use γ = (2 / 3)π2k2BN0, where N0 = (1 / 4π2)(2m / 2)kF is the single-spin density of states. Combining these relations one finds that both values differ by a numerical factor

[formula]

The BCS relation connecting the critical temperature with the condensation energy defined via the magnetic field yields another numerical factor

[formula]

In the two-fluid model we find [formula]. The correction

[formula]

is by an order of magnitude less important than the factor 1.43 from relation ([\ref=e25aa]), however.

>From ([\ref=e25b]) we obtain Tc in terms of B0, which we use in the force density ([\ref=e22]). With the BCS relation ([\ref=e25a]), the electrostatic force density ([\ref=e22]) reads

[formula]

One can see that the dominant contribution is increased by slightly more than 50% as compared to the phenomenological force density ([\ref=e14]) and the Gorter-Casimir approximation ([\ref=e25]). Compared to the Gorter-Casimir approximation the critical temperature TGCc is replaced additionally by the BCS value TBCSc. It will thus be interesting to test the validity of the phenomenological force on materials of rather different coupling strength.

Discussion

We have shown that the change of the volume during the superconducting transition can be expressed as a compression caused by the surface dipole. In analogy we have used the internal electrostatic potential for the lattice deformation in the bulk. The force resulting from the electrostatic potential in the superconductor is similar but not identical to the phenomenological force suggested from the volume change.

For moderately coupled materials well described by the Gorter-Casimir two-fluid model, the phenomenological and the electrostatic forces have identical dominant terms [formula]. They differ in the correction terms only. For weakly coupled superconductors covered by the BCS theory, the dominant term is increased by nearly 50%. We have not discussed the strongly coupled superconductors which do not obey any of these limits. One can expect that the dominant term is reduced.

It is a question whether the above derived small differences in the internal forces can be accessed by some of recent experiments. Among the physical phenomena mentioned in the introduction, the magnetostriction offers the most sensitive experimental technique. Indeed, one can resolve even deformations driven by such small changes in magnetization as those caused by the de Haas-van Alphen effect with relative changes of the susceptibility of the order of one in ten millions.[\cite=GCh63] A superconductor in the Meissner state is an ideal diamagnet with large but fixed magnetization. Small deviations from ideality appear due to the penetration of the magnetic field into the surface. At the same time, the magnetostriction combines the internal forces with the surface dipole. To separate these two contributions, it will be necessary to analyze how the deformation depends on the sample geometry.

The two approaches compared in this paper represent two extreme models. In the electrostatic approach all forces are attributed to a mean electric field. In the phenomenological model the system is treated as locally neutral which implies that all forces are attributed to bonds between ions. We expect that a realistic description requires to combine both approaches.
