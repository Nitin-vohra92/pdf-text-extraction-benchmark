On the ground state of quantum layers

Introduction

The problem is from mesoscopic physics: let [formula] be an embedded surface in [formula], we assume that

[formula] is orientable, complete, but non-compact;

[formula] is not totally geodesic;

[formula] is asymptotically flat in the sense that the second fundamental form goes to zero at infinity.

On can build a quantum layer Ω over such a surface [formula] as follows: as a differentiable manifold, [formula] for some positive number a. Let [formula] be the unit normal vector of [formula] in [formula]. Define

[formula]

by

[formula]

Obviously, if a is small, then p̃ is an embedding. The Riemannian metric ds2Ω is defined as the pull-back of the Euclidean metric via p̃. The Riemannian manifold (Ω,ds2Ω) is called the quantum layer.

Let Δ  =  ΔΩ be the Dirichlet Laplacian. Then we make the following

Using the above notations, and further assume that

[formula]

Then the ground state of Δ exists.

We make the following explanation of the notations and terminology:

Ω is a smooth manifold with boundary. The Dirichlet Laplacian is the self-adjoint extenstion of the Laplacian acting on C∞0(Ω);

By a theorem of Huber [\cite=huber], if  [\eqref=huber] is valid, then [formula] is differmorphic to a compact Riemann surface with finitely many points removed. Moreover, White [\cite=bwhite] proved that if

[formula]

then

[formula]

Thus [\eqref=huber] can be weakened.

Since Δ is a self-adjoint operator, the spectrum of Δ is the disjoint union of two parts: pure point spectrum (eigenvalues of finite multiplicity) and the essential spectrum. The ground state is the smallest eigenvalue with finite multiplicity.

The conjecture was proved under the condition

[formula]

in [\cite=dek] [\cite=cek-1] by Duclos, Exner and Krejik and later by Carron, Exner, and Krejik. Thus the remaining case is when

[formula]

By a theorem of Hartman [\cite=hartman], we know that

[formula]

where λi are the isoperimetric constants at each end of [formula]. Thus we have

[formula]

and g = 0. The surface must be differmorphic to [formula]. However, even through the topology of the surface is completely known, this is the most difficult case for the conjecture.

Variational Principle

It is well known that

[formula]

is the infimum of the Laplacian, and

[formula]

is the infimum of the essential spectrum, where K is running over all the compact subset of Ω. Since [formula], it is not hard to see that

[formula]

where K is running over all the compact set of [formula].

By definition, we have σ  ≤  σess. Furthermore, we have

If σ0  <  σess, then the ground state exists and is equal to σ0.

Let (x1,x2) be a local coordinate system of [formula]. Then (x1,x2,t) defines a local coordinate system of Ω. Such a local coordinate system is called a Fermi coordinate system. Let x3 = t and let ds2Ω = Gijdxidxj. Then we have

[formula]

We make the following defintion: let f be a smooth function of Ω. Then we define

[formula]

where [formula].

Obviously, we have

[formula]

It follows that

[formula]

for a smooth function f∈C∞(Ω), where

[formula]

is the norm of the horizontal differential. Apprently, we have

[formula]

Let ds2Σ = gijdxidxj be the Riemannian metric of [formula] under the coordinates (x1,x2). Then we are above to compare the matrices (Gij)1  ≤  i,j  ≤  2 and (gij), at least outside a big compact set of [formula]. By [\eqref=gij], we have

[formula]

We assume that at the point x, gij  =  δij. Then we have

[formula]

where B is the second fundamental form of the surface [formula]. Thus we have the following conclusion:

For any ε > 0, there is a compact set K of [formula] such that on [formula] we have

[formula]

In particular, we have

[formula]

Let [formula]. Then we proved the followng:

Using the above notations, we have

[formula]

Proof. Let K be any compact set of [formula]. If [formula], then by Proposition [\ref=prop22], we have

[formula]

where the last inequality is from the 1-dimensional Poincaré inequality. Thus by using Proposition [\ref=prop22] again, we have

[formula]

for any ε. Thus we have

[formula]

and the lemma is proved.

Although not needed in this paper, we can actually prove that σess  =  κ2. To see this, we first observe that since the second fundamental form of [formula] is bounded, there is a lower bound for the injectivity radius. As a result, the volume of the surface [formula] is infinite. By the assumption, the Gauss curvature is integrable. Thus [formula] is parabolic (cf. [\cite=li]). From the above, we conclude that for any ε,C > 0 and any compact sets K  ⊂    ⊂  K' of [formula], there is a smooth function [formula] such that

[formula]

Let   =  φχ, where χ  =   cos κt. Then [formula] is a function on Ω with compact support. Since the second fundamental form goes to zero at infinity, by Proposition [\ref=prop22], for K' large enough, we have

[formula]

Thus from [\eqref=q] and Proposition [\ref=prop22] again, we have

[formula]

A straightforward computation gives

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

By the definition of σess, we have

[formula]

We let ε  →  0 and C  →    ∞  , then we have σess  ≤  κ2, as needed.

The upper bound of σ0

It is usually more difficult to estimate σ0 from above. In  [\cite=ll-1], we proved the following

Let [formula] be a convex surface in [formula] which can be represented by the graph of a convex function z = f(x,y). Suppose 0 is the minimum point of the function and suppose that at 0, f is strictly convex. Furthermore suppose that the second fundamental form goes to zero at infinity. Let C be the supremum of the second fundamental form of [formula]. Let Ca < 1. Then the ground state of the quantum layer Ω exists.

In this section, we generalize the above result into the following:

Let [formula] be a complete surface in [formula] with nonnegative Gauss curvature but not totally geodesic. Furthermore suppose that the second fundamental form of [formula] goes to zero at infinity. Let C be the supremum of the second fundamental form of [formula]. Let Ca < 1. Then the ground state of the quantum layer Ω built over [formula] with width a exists.

Since for all convex function f in Theorem [\ref=main3], the Gauss curvature is nonnegative, the above theorem is indeed a generalization of Theorem [\ref=main3]. On the other hand, by a theorem of Sacksteder [\cite=sack], any complete surface of nonnegative curvature is either a developable surface or the graph of some convex function. At a first glance, it seems that there is not much difference between the surfaces in both theorems. However, we have to use a complete different method to prove this slight generalization.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=main4]. If the Gauss curvature is identically zero, then By  [\cite=ll-4], the ground state exists.

If the Guass curvature is positive at one point, then by using the theorem of Sacksteder [\cite=sack], [formula] can be represented by the graph of some convex function. If we fix an orientation, we can assume that H, the mean curvature, is always nonnegative.

By a result of White [\cite=bwhite], we know that there is an ε0 > 0 such that for R >  > 0,

[formula]

where B is the second fundamental form of [formula]. Since [formula] is convex, we have

[formula]

Thus we have

[formula]

provided that R2 > R1 are large enough.

We will create suitable test functions using the techniques similar to  [\cite=dek] [\cite=cek-1] [\cite=ll-1] [\cite=ll-2] [\cite=ll-4]. Let [formula] be a smooth function such that

[formula]

where ε1  →  0 as R  →    ∞  . The existence of such a function φ is guaranteed by the parabolicity of [formula]. Then we have, as in Remark [\ref=rem21], that

[formula]

Since K is integrable, for any ε2 > 0, there is an R0 > 0 such that if R > R0, we have

[formula]

Now let's consider a function [formula]. Consider the function jχ(t)t, where j is a smooth function on [formula] such that [formula] on [formula]; 0  ≤  j  ≤  1; and [formula]. Then there is an absolute constant C1, such that

[formula]

Finally, let's consider Q(φχ(t),jχ(t)t). Since [formula], by [\eqref=q1], Q1(φχ(t),jχ(t)t) = 0. Let

[formula]

Then

[formula]

Let ε > 0. Then we have

[formula]

By  [\eqref=use], we have

[formula]

If

[formula]

then there is a suitable ε > 0 such that

[formula]

Thus σ0  <  κ2.

Further Discussions.

We proved the following more general

We assume that [formula] satisfies

The isopermetric inequality holds. That is, there is a constant δ1 > 0 such that if D is a domain in [formula], we have

[formula]

There is another positive constant δ2 > 0 such that for any compact set K of [formula], there is a curve C outside the set K such that if [formula] is one of its normal vector in [formula], then there is a vector [formula] such that

[formula]

for some fixed vector [formula].

Then the ground state exists.

Proof. We let φ be a smooth function such that [formula] for R >  > R / 4 >  > 4r >  > r > 0 large. We also assume that on [formula], [formula]. Let ε0 > 0 be a positive number to be determined later such that

[formula]

Note that ε0 is independent of R.

We let [formula]. Then there is a constant C such that

[formula]

Let C be a curve outside the compact set B(4r) satisfying the condition in the theorem. We let R big enough that C  ⊂  B(R / 4).

In order to construct the test functions, we let ρ be the cut-off function such that ρ = 1 if t  ≤  0 and ρ = 0 if t  ≥  1 and we assume that ρ is decreasing. Near the curve C, any point p has a coordinate (t,s), where s∈C from the exponential map. To be more precise, let (x1,x2) be the the local coordinates near C such that locally C can be represented by x1 = 0. Let the Riemannian metric under this coordinate system be

[formula]

The fact that [formula] is a normal vector implies that if

[formula]

then

[formula]

Let σt(x2) be the geodesic lines starting from x2∈C with initial vector [formula]. Then σt is the exponential map. The Jacobian of the map at t = 0 is

[formula]

In particular, γ1  ≠  0 since the map must be nonsingular. A simple computation shows that [formula]. Thus [formula] is proportional to [formula].

Let φ1 be a cut-off function such that [formula] on [formula] and [formula].

We define (p) = φ1ρ(t / ε1), where ε1 is a positive constant to be determined. WLOG, let [formula] be the z-direction in the Euclidean space.

Let [formula] be the normal vector of [formula]. Let nz be the z-component of [formula]. We compute the following term Q(φχ,nzχ1), where [formula]. First Q1(φχ,nzχ1) = 0 becasue supp(nz) is contained in the area where [formula]. On the other hand, since χχ1 is an odd function, we have

[formula]

A straight computation shows that

[formula]

Furthermore, we have Hnz  =  Δz. As a result, we have

[formula]

(Note that [formula] on the points we are interested). We have the following Taylar expansion:

[formula]

Since [formula], ,we have

[formula]

We choose ε1 small enough, then we have

[formula]

If we let ε  →  0, then that above becomes

[formula]

Finally, we have [formula], thus we have

[formula]

where D is the domain C enclosed. To summary, for any ε < 0, we have

[formula]

Using the isopermetric inequality, we know that if ε0  <  δ1δ22 / C2 is small enough, then

[formula]

which proves the theorem.

Using the same proof, we can prove the following:

Using the same notations as in Conjecture [\ref=ccon], we assume further that

[formula]

where [formula] is a reference point of [formula]. Then Conjecture [\ref=ccon] is true.
