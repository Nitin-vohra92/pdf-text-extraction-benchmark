On algebraically integrable outer billiards

In this note, an outer billiard table is a compact convex domain in the plane bounded by an oval (closed smooth strictly convex curve) C. Pick a point x outside of C. There are two tangent lines from x to C; choose one of them, say, the right one from the view-point of x, and reflect x in the tangency point. One obtains a new point, y, and the transformation T:x  ↦  y is the outer (a.k.a. dual) billiard map. We refer to [\cite=D-T] [\cite=Ta1] [\cite=Ta2] for surveys of outer billiards.

If C is an ellipse then the map T possesses a 1-parameter family of invariant curves, the homothetic ellipses; these invariant curves foliate the exterior of C. Conjecturally, if an outer neighborhood of an oval C is foliated by the invariant curves of the outer billiard map then C is an ellipse - this is an outer version of the famous Birkhoff conjecture concerning the conventional, inner billiards.

In this note we show that ellipses are rigid in a much more restrictive sense of algebraically integrable outer billiards; see [\cite=Bo] for the case of inner billiards.

We make the following assumptions. Let f(x,y) be a (non-homogeneous) real polynomial such that zero is its non-singular value and C is a component of the zero level curve. Thus f is the defining polynomial of the curve C, and if a polynomial vanishes on C then it is a multiple of f. Assume that a neighborhood of C is foliated by invariant curves of the outer billiard map T, and this foliation is algebraic in the sense that its leaves are components of the level curves of a real polynomial F(x,y). Since C itself is an invariant curve, we assume that F(x,y) = 0 on C, and that dF is not identically zero on C. Thus F(x,y) = g(x,y)f(x,y) where g(x,y) is a polynomial, not identically zero on C. Under these assumptions, our result is as follows.

C is an ellipse.

Proof.

Consider the tangent vector field v  =  Fy ∂  /  ∂x - Fx ∂  /  ∂y (the symplectic gradient) along C. This vector field is non-zero (except, possibly, a finite number of points) and tangent to C. The tangent line to C at point (x,y) is given by (x + εFy,y - εFx), and the condition that F is T-invariant means that the function

[formula]

is even in ε for all (x,y)∈C. Expand in a series in ε; the first non-trivial condition is cubic in ε:

[formula]

on C. We claim that this already implies that C is an ellipse. The idea is that otherwise the complex curve f = 0 would have an inflection point, in contradiction with identity ([\ref=cubic]).

Consider the polynomial

[formula]

One has: 1). v(H(F)) = W(F); 2). H(F) = H(gf) = g3H(f) on C; 3). If C' is a non-singular algebraic curve with a defining polynomial f(x,y) and (x,y) is an inflection point of C' then H(f)(x,y) = 0.

Proof of Lemma [\ref=lm].

The first two claims follow from straightforward computations. To prove the third, note that H(f) is the second order term in ε of the Taylor expansion of the function f(x + εfy,y - εfx) (cf. ([\ref=funct])), hence H(f) = 0 at an inflection point. [formula]

It follows from Lemma [\ref=lm] and ([\ref=cubic]) that H(F) =  const on C. Since C is convex, H(F)  ≠  0, and we may assume that H(F) = 1 on C. It follows that g3H(f) - 1 vanishes on C and hence

[formula]

where h(x,y) is some polynomial.

Now consider the situation in [formula]. We continue to use the notation C for the complex algebraic curve given by the homogenized polynomial [formula]. Unless C is a conic, this curve has inflection points (not necessarily real). Let d be the degree of C.

Not all the inflections of C lie on the line at infinity

Proof of Lemma [\ref=line].

Consider the Hessian curve given by

[formula]

The intersection points of the curve C with its Hessian curve are the inflection points of C (recall that C is non-singular). The degree of the Hessian curve is 3(d - 2), and by the Bezout theorem, the total number of inflections, counted with multiplicities, is 3d(d - 2). Furthermore, the order of intersection equals the order of the respective inflection and does not exceed d - 2, see, e.g, [\cite=Wa]. The number of intersection points of C with a line equals d, hence the inflection points of C that lie on a fixed line contribute, at most, d(d - 2) to the total of 3d(d - 2). The remaining inflection point lie off this line. [formula]

To conclude the proof of Theorem [\ref=main], consider a finite inflection point of C. According to Lemma [\ref=lm], at such a point point, we have f = H(f) = 0 which contradicts ([\ref=ideal]). This is proves that C is a conic. [formula]

Remarks.

1). It would be interesting to remove the non-degeneracy assumptions in Theorem [\ref=main].

2). A more general version of Birkhoff's integrability conjecture is as follows. Let C be a plane oval whose outer neighborhood is foliated by closed curves. For a tangent line [formula] to C, the intersections with the leaves of the foliation define a local involution σ on [formula]. Assume that, for every tangent line, the involution σ is projective. Conjecturally, then C is an ellipse and the foliation consists of ellipses that form a pencil (that is, share four - real or complex - common points). For a pencil of conics, the respective involutions are projective: this is a Desargues theorem, see [\cite=Ber]. It would be interesting to establish an algebraic version of this conjecture.
