Proposition Lemma Corollary

At Least Half Of All Graphs Satisfy [formula]

Introduction

In [\cite=reed97] Reed conjectured that

[formula]

In the same paper he proved that there exists ε  >  0 such that

[formula]

holds for every graph. The ε used in the proof is quite small (less than 10- 8).

We prove the following.

To prove this we combine a result from [\cite=ColoringGraphsContainingADoublyCriticalEdge] on graphs containing a doubly critical edge with the following lemma.

Here ι is the maximum number of singleton color classes appearing in an optimal coloring of the graph (formally defined below).

Stinginess

In [\cite=ColoringGraphsContainingADoublyCriticalEdge] it was shown that a doubly critical edge is enough to imply an upper bound on the chromatic number that is slightly weaker than Reed's conjectured upper bound.

If G is a graph containing a doubly critical edge, then

[formula]

The following two lemmas were proved in [\cite=reedNote] using matching theory results.

If G is a graph with [formula], then

[formula]

If G is a graph with α(G)  ≤  2, then

[formula]

Let G be a graph for which every optimal coloring has all color classes of order at most 2. Then

[formula]

If α(G)  ≤  2, the result follows by Lemma [\ref=ReedForAlphaAtMostTwo]. Hence we may assume that we have an independent set I  ⊆  G with |I|  ≥  3. Put [formula]. Since G has no optimal coloring containing a color class of order ≥  3, we have χ(H)  =  χ(G). Then

[formula]

Hence, by Lemma [\ref=ReedForChiBIggerThanHalf], we have

[formula]

The lemma follows.

The stinginess of a graph G (denoted ι(G)) is the maximum number of singleton color classes appearing in an optimal coloring of G. An optimal coloring of G is called stingy just in case it has the maximum number of singleton color classes.

Let G be a graph and H an induced subgraph of G. If [formula], then [formula].

Assume that [formula]. Then patching together any optimal coloring of [formula] with any optimal coloring of H yields an optimal coloring of G. The lemma follows.

Let G be a graph. Then [formula].

Let [formula] be a stingy coloring of G. Since |Ij|  ≥  2 for 1  ≤  j  ≤  m, we have [formula].

Respectfully Greedy Partial Colorings

Let G be a graph. A partial coloring C of G is called r-greedy just in case every color class has order at least r.

Let G be a graph. A partial coloring of C of G is called respectful just in case [formula].

Let G be a graph and C a respectful 3-greedy partial coloring of G with [formula] minimal. Then

[formula]

Put [formula]. By the minimality of |H|, every optimal coloring of H has all color classes of order at most 2. Thus, by Lemma [\ref=ReedForAtMostTwoFrames], we have

[formula]

Using the minimality of |H| again, we see that every vertex of H is adjacent to at least one vertex in each element of C. Hence Δ(H)  ≤  Δ(G)  -  |C|. Putting it all together, we have

[formula]

Let C be a respectful 3-greedy partial coloring of a graph G with [formula] minimal. Since [formula] we have [formula] (by Lemma [\ref=StinginessPreservedInPatchedColorings]). Applying Lemma [\ref=ChiAtMostAverageOfStinginessAndOrder] yields

[formula]

Adding this inequality with the inequality in Lemma [\ref=RespectfulAndGreedy] gives

[formula]

The lemma follows.

The Main Results

Let G be a graph. Then at least one of the following holds,

[formula],

[formula].

Assume that (1) does not hold. Then, by Lemma [\ref=BarelyStingyImpliesAlmostReed], we have ι(G)  <  2. Applying the Key Lemma gives

[formula]

The theorem follows.

Let G be a graph satisfying [formula]. Then G also satisfies

[formula]

By Theorem [\ref=MainDisjunct], G satisfies

[formula]

We would like to find an upper bound on the chromatic number that must hold for a graph or its complement. The previous corollary is not quite good enough for this purpose since it doesn't handle [formula]-regular graphs. Instead, we use the following.

Let G be a graph satisfying [formula]. Then G also satisfies

[formula]

By Theorem [\ref=MainDisjunct], G satisfies

[formula]

Since every graph satisfies Δ  +    ≥  Δ  +  n  -  1  -  Δ  =  n  -  1, combining the pigeonhole principle with Corollary [\ref=LargeDeltaImpliesQuarterBound] proves the following.
