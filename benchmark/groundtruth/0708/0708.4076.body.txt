Hölder stability of diffeomorphisms

Introduction

Let M be a compact C∞ manifold, [formula] be the group of C1 diffeomorphisms of M. [formula] is structurally stable if for any [formula] sufficiently C1 close to f, there is a homeomorphism h of M such that g = hfh- 1. Recall that f satisfies Axiom A if the nonwandering set Ω of f is hyperbolic and the set of periodic points of f is dense in Ω, f satisfies the strong transversality condition if for any two points x,y∈Ω the stable manifold Ws(x) intersects the unstable manifold Wu(y) transversally. By the Structural Stability Theorem of Robbin, Robinson, Liao and Mañé [\cite=R1] [\cite=R2] [\cite=Li] [\cite=Ma], [formula] is structurally stable if and only if f satisfies Axiom A and the strong transversality condition. It is also known that in this case the conjugacy h can be chosen to be Hölder on the nonwandering set Ω of f (see [\cite=KH]).

In this paper, we prove that in the above case, the conjugacy h can be chosen to be Hölder not only on Ω but also on the whole manifold M. We say that a deffeomorphism f of M is Hölder stable if for any [formula] sufficiently C1 close to f, there is a Hölder homeomorphism h of M such that g = hfh- 1 (This notion should not be confused with the notion of Cr structural stability of a Cr diffeomorphism, for which g is Cr close to f and the conjugacy h is only required to be continuous). We prove that Axiom A plus the strong transversality condition is also equivalent to Hölder stability. For simplicity, we assume that f is C2.

Let f be a C2 diffeomorphism of a compact C∞ manifold M. Then f is Hölder stable if and only if f satisfies Axiom A and the strong transversality condition.

Since Hölder stability implies structural stability, to prove Theorem [\ref=T:main], it is sufficient by the Structural Stability Theorem to prove that Axiom A plus the strong transversality condition implies Hölder stability.

To state the quantitative result, we recall the notion of hyperbolicity. The nonwandering set Ω of a diffeomorphism f is hyperbolic if the restriction TM|Ω of the tangent bundle TM on Ω admits a Tf-invariant continuous splitting [formula] such that for some λ∈(0,1),

[formula]

Here the norm is evaluated with respect to some adapted smooth Riemannian metric on M.

Let f be a C2 diffeomorphism of a compact C∞ manifold M satisfying Axiom A and the strong transversality condition. Let λ∈(0,1) be as in [\eqref=E:lambda], [formula]. Suppose α∈(0,1) satisfies λlα < 1. Then for any Cα neighborhood V of the identity map in Cα(M,M), there exists a C1 neighborhood N of f in [formula] such that for every g∈N, there is a homeomorphism h of M in V such that g = hfh- 1, and the assignment g  ↦  h is C1 as a map N  →  C0(M,M) and sends f to the identity.

Here [formula] denotes the Lipschitz constant of f, Cα(M,M) and C0(M,M) are the Banach manifolds of Cα and C0 maps on M, respectively.

Hölder stabillity over hyperbolic sets is well known ([\cite=KH]). It is also well known that the (un)stable distributions and (un)stable foliations over hyperbolic sets are Hölder continuous ([\cite=KH]). For more results on Hölder regularity for hyperbolic dynamical systems, see [\cite=Ha].

One can not expect more regularity of the conjugacy h than to be Hölder. For example, Lipschitz conjugacies almost never exist. But for dynamical systems of large group actions, Cr or C∞ conjugacies may exist (see [\cite=Fi] and the references therein).

Our proof of Theorem [\ref=T:main2] follows the approach of Robbin-Robinson [\cite=R1] [\cite=R2], where the result that Axiom A plus the strong transversality condition implies structural stability is proved. As in Robbin [\cite=R1], we divide the proof into three steps, which are the contents of the following three sections.

In Section 2, we prove that for each component Ωi in the spectral decomposition of Ω, the splitting [formula] can be extended to a Tf-invariant splitting [formula] satisfying certain compatibility condition, where Ui is a neighborhood of Ωi, [formula]. The proof follows ideas in [\cite=R1] [\cite=R2]. But since we require that the extended splitting to be Hölder, and the metric d on M, unlike Robbin's metric df [\cite=R1], is not f-preserving, we need more careful topological arguments. Indeed, we can only prove that the extended bundles Eui and Esi are Hölder on [formula] for every N > 0. But this is sufficient for us to derive further results. In Section 2 we only need the weaker restriction λ2lα < 1 on the Hölder exponent α comparing with Theorem [\ref=T:main2], and the case of α = 1 is allowed, which means as usual that the subbundles are Lipschitz.

Using the extended splitting in Section 2, we prove in Section 3 that the induced operator [formula] of f on the Banach space of C0 vector fields has a right inverse which restricts to a continuous linear operator on the Banach space of Cα and df-Lipschitz vector fields. The proof is also motivated by [\cite=R1]. But as in Section 2, since f does not preserve the metric d, some different topological arguments are needed. The condition of [formula] is not explicitly used in the proof. But since it is easy to see that l  ≥  λ- 1, the inequality λlα < 1 for α = 1 never holds. So the case of α = 1 is automatically excluded.

In Section 4 we finish the proof of Theorem [\ref=T:main2]. We first prove a version of Implicit Function Theorem for Banach spaces involving non-closed subspaces. Then using the result in Section 3, we can apply the Implicit Function Theorem to the C1 map [formula], Ψ(g,h) = ghf- 1 to obtain a fixed point h of Ψ(g,  ·  ) for g sufficiently C1 close to f, and h is sufficiently Cα and df-Lipschitz close to the identity. As in [\cite=R1] [\cite=R2], the fact that h is df-Lipschitz close to the identity implies h is a homeomorphism.

Most arguments concerning C0 estimates in this paper are borrowed from [\cite=R1] [\cite=R2] except for a few changes of details. But to introduce notations in order to perform the Cα estimates, it seems necessary to repeat some of them.

The author would like to thank Professors Boris Hasselblatt and Lan Wen for useful comments.

Extensions of the splitting

In this section we prove that the splitting [formula] can be extended to a neighborhood of each component of Ω and satisfies certain compatibility condition. This is motivated by [\cite=R1] and [\cite=R2].

We first collect some standard facts that are used in the proof of Theorem [\ref=T:1] below. Most of them can be found in [\cite=HPPS] [\cite=R1] [\cite=S]. Let f be a diffeomorphism of a compact manifold M satisfying Axiom A and the strong transversality condition. Let [formula] be the spectral decomposition of the nonwandering set Ω of f. Each Ωi is a closed topological transitive hyperbolic f-invariant subset of M, and Eu,Es have constant ranks on Ωi. The components Ωi can be ordered in such a way that i < j implies [formula], where [formula], σ = u,s. For a subset U of M, denote [formula], [formula], [formula]. Then for Ωi,Ωj such that [formula] and sufficiently small neighborhoods Ui,Uj of Ωi and Ωj, [formula]. A subset U of M is called unrevisited if x∈U, n > 0, fn(x)∈U imply fm(x)∈U for 0 < m < n. Then each Ωi has arbitrarily small unrevisited open neighborhood.

We fix an Ωi. For x∈Ωi and δ > 0, let Wuδ(x) and Wsδ(x) be the local unstable and stable manifolds of size δ at x. Let [formula], σ = u,s. For δ sufficiently small, Wσδ(Ωi) has arbitrarily small unrevisited open neighborhood. Let [formula]. Then for δ sufficiently small, D has arbitrarily small unrevisited open neighborhood, and for any open neighborhood Q of D, the set [formula] is an unrevisited open neighborhood of Ωi.

As in [\cite=R1] [\cite=R2], we introduce the metric df on M by [formula], where d is the metric induced from some Riemannian metric on M.

Let f be a C2 diffeomorphism of M satisfying Axiom A and the strong transversality condition, [formula] be the spectral decomposition, and the components Ωi are ordered as above. Let λ∈(0,1) be as in [\eqref=E:lambda], [formula]. Suppose α∈(0,1] satisfies λ2lα < 1. Then for any λ'∈(λ,1), there exist for each 1  ≤  i  ≤  k an open neighborhood Ui of Ωi and two Tf-invariant continuous subbundles Eσi of TM|O(Ui), σ = u,s, such that (i) [formula]; (ii) Eσi is Cα and df-Lipschitz on [formula] for every N > 0; (iii) [formula], [formula] for x∈Ui; (iv) for i < j, [formula], and (Esi)x  ⊂  (Esj)x, (Euj)x  ⊂  (Eui)x for every [formula].

We extend the definition of the bundles Eu and Es on Ω as Eu  =  {v∈TM: lim n  →    +    ∞|Tf- n(v)| = 0}, Es  =  {v∈TM: lim n  →    +    ∞|Tfn(v)| = 0}, and denote [formula], σ = u,s. By the strong transversality condition, TxM = Eux + Esx for every x∈M. For each Ωi, Eσ|Wσ(Ωi) is a continuous subbundle of TM|Wσ(Ωi) with constant rank.

As in [\cite=R1], to prove Theorem [\ref=T:1], it is sufficient to prove that under the conditions of Theorem [\ref=T:1], there exist for each i an open neighborhood Ui of Ωi and a Tf-invariant continuous subbundle Eui of TM|O(Ui) such that (i') Eui|Ωi = Eu|Ωi; (ii') Eui is Cα and df-Lipschitz on [formula] for every N > 0; (iii') for i < j, [formula], and (Euj)x  ⊂  (Eui)x for every [formula]; (iv') TxM = (Eui)x + Esx for every x∈O(Ui).

We prove this by induction on [formula]. Let 1  ≤  i  ≤  k. Suppose that for j < i, Uj and Euj have been defined and satisfy (i')-(iv') (for i = 1 nothing is defined). We construct Ui and Eui satisfying (i')-(iv').

Let λ  <  λ1  <  λ2  <  λ3 < 1 be such that λ23lα < 1. Let V1 be an open neighborhood of Ωi such that [formula] for all j < i (shrinking Uj, j < i if necessary). Choose continuous subbundles [formula] of TM|V1 with [formula], σ = u,s. Since [formula], shrinking V1 if necessary, we may assume that [formula]. Write [formula] as

[formula]

with respect to the splitting [formula], [formula]. Since [formula], [formula], [formula] for x∈Ωi, by making V1 smaller, we may assume that [formula], [formula] for [formula]. Note that since [formula] and Tf(Es) = Es, [formula].

Choose δ > 0 such that Wsδ(Ωi)  ⊂  V1, and such that Wsδ(Ωi) has arbitrarily small unrevisited open neighborhood. Let [formula]. Similar to the arguments in [\cite=R1], we can prove (after possibly shrinking of Uj,j < i in the induction hypothesis) that there exist an open neighborhood Q1  ⊂  V1 of D and a Cα and df-Lipschitz subbundle Eui0 of TM|Q1 such that (1) Tf((Eui0)x) = (Eui0)f(x) for [formula]; (2) [formula] and TxM = (Eui0)x + Esx for x∈Q1; (3) (Eui0)x  ⊂  (Euj)x if j < i and [formula]. We may also assume that [formula].

Since [formula], there exists a continuous vector bundle morphism [formula] such that [formula]. By making Q1 smaller, we may assume that [formula] is bounded, say [formula] for some [formula].

Choose ε > 0 such that rε  ≤  λ- 12  -  λ- 13. Since [formula], we may choose an unrevisited open neighborhood V2  ⊂  V1 of Wsδ(Ωi) such that [formula] for x∈V2. Let [formula] be an unrevisited open neighborhood of D. Choose C1 approximations Ēu,Ēs of [formula] such that (1) [formula], and if

[formula]

with respect to this splitting, then [formula], [formula], [formula] for [formula]; (2) [formula], and if τ0:Ēu|Q2  →  Ēs|Q2 is the vector bundle morphism such that [formula], then [formula]; (3) there exists a continuous vector bundle morphism [formula] such that [formula], and [formula]. Note that since f is C2 and the splitting [formula] is C1, Fσσ' is C1, where σ,σ' = u,s. Note also that since Eui0 is Cα and df-Lipschitz, τ0 is Cα and df-Lipschitz.

Consider the smooth vector bundle L over V2 whose fiber Lx at x∈V2 is the space L(Ēux,Ēsx) of linear maps from Ēux to Ēsx. A section τ of L is a vector bundle morphism from Ēu to Ēs covering the identity. Let L(r)x be the disc [formula] in Lx, and [formula] be the disc bundle of L. Let [formula]. For g∈L(r)x, define

[formula]

σ = u,s. Then for v∈Ēux, we have

[formula]

So φug is invertible, and

[formula]

we also have

[formula]

Thus if we define the graph transform of g∈L(r)x by

[formula]

then

[formula]

Note that since Fσσ' is C1, the map [formula] is C1.

Let [formula], g1,g2∈L(r)x. Then

[formula]

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

For the convenience of the following discussion, we embed M isometrically into some Euclidian space [formula]. Then for x∈V2, Ēsx and Ēux can be viewed as subspaces of [formula], and we have the identification

[formula]

Then for g1,g2∈L with different base points, the summation g1 + g2 and its norm [formula] make sense, as they are viewed as elements in [formula]. Let Γx  =  Γ|Lx be the restriction of Γ on the fiber Lx. Since the map [formula] is C1, it is Lipschitz and Cα, which means that there exists C > 0 such that

[formula]

for any [formula] and g1∈L(r)x,g2∈L(r)y. Note that since Γ covers f and f is Lipschitz, we have indeed omitted a term d(f(x),f(y)) in the left hand side of [\eqref=E:Lip].

Recall that [formula]. So there exist d0 > 0 and an unrevisited open neighborhood Q3  ⊂  Q2 of D such that d(Q3,Wu(Ωi))  ≥  d0, and such that x∈Q3,y∈M,d(x,y) < d0 imply y∈Q2. Let [formula]. Since V2 and [formula] are unrevisited open neighborhoods of Ωi, so is V3.

To simplify notations, we denote

[formula]

for x,y∈M. Then a section τ of L is Cα and df-Lipschitz if and only if

[formula]

Now we choose

[formula]

such that

[formula]

for x,y∈Q2, where [formula] is the diameter of M. Let

[formula]

Σ is a closed subset of the Banach space of continuous bounded sections of L|V3. By taking a bump function on M which is 1 in Q3 and 0 outside Q2 and enlarging K if necessary, it is easy to see that Σ is nonempty. Define the graph transform [formula] of τ∈Σ as the section

[formula]

of L|V3. We prove that [formula] maps Σ into Σ and is a contraction on Σ.

First we show that [formula]. Let x∈V3. Recall that [formula]. If [formula], then there exists [formula] such that f- n(x)∈V2. Since V2 is unrevisited, f- 1(x)∈V2. We also have f- 1(x)∈Wu(Ωi). Hence [formula]. If [formula], there exists y∈Q3 such that x = fn(y) for some [formula]. If n = 0 then x∈Q3. If [formula], since V2 is unrevisited, fn - 1(y)∈V2. Hence [formula]. This proves [formula].

Let τ∈Σ. We show that [formula]. Let x∈Q3. If [formula], then [formula]. If [formula], then f- n(x)∈Q3 for some [formula]. Since Q3 is unrevisited, f- 1(x)∈Q3. So [formula]. So [formula].

Now [formula] is continuous on Q3 and [formula]. Since [formula] and Q3 are open in V3 and [formula], [formula] is continuous on V3.

By [\eqref=E:<=K], [formula] for [formula]. So [formula].

Now we show that [formula] for τ∈Σ and x,y∈V3. There are three cases.

(1) [formula]. This is obvious since [formula] and [formula].

(2) [formula]. If d(x,y)  ≥  d0, then

[formula]

Suppose d(x,y) < d0. Since x∈Q3, we have y∈Q2 and y∉Wu(Ωi). So there exists [formula] such that f- n(y)∈Q3. But Q2 is unrevisited and [formula]. So we must have n = 1 and then [formula]. So [formula].

(3) [formula]. By [\eqref=E:contraction] and [\eqref=E:Lip],

[formula]

Similarly,

[formula]

So [formula].

This proves that [formula] maps Σ into Σ. By [\eqref=E:contraction], [formula] is a contraction on Σ. So there is a fixed point [formula] of [formula] in Σ.

Choose δ' > 0 such that [formula]. We prove that |Wuδ'(Ωi)  =  τ0'|Wuδ'(Ωi). Let x0∈Wuδ'(Ωi) be such that [formula] assumes maximal value at x0. Then

[formula]

Hence [formula], which implies that [formula].

Define the Cα and df-Lipschitz subbundle Eui1 of TM|V3 by [formula]. Then Eui1|Q3 = Eui0|Q3, Eui1|Wuδ'(Ωi) = Eu|Wuδ'(Ωi), and Tf((Eui1)x) = (Eui1)f(x) if [formula].

Now consider the Cα and df-Lipschitz subbundle Tfn(Eui1) of TM|fn(V3), [formula]. If for [formula], n < m, [formula], then for [formula], f- n(x)∈V3, f- m(x)∈V3. Since V3 is unrevisited, f- p(x)∈V3 for n  ≤  p  ≤  m. So for n + 1  ≤  p  ≤  m, [formula] and then Tfp(Eui1)x = Tfp - 1(Tf((Eui1)f- p(x))) = Tfp - 1((Eui1)f- p + 1(x)) = Tfp - 1(Eui1)x. So Tfn(Eui1)x = Tfm(Eui1)x, and then the bundles Tfn(Eui1) [formula] patch together to a Tf-invariant subbundle Eui2 of TM|O(V3). It is obviously continuous since fn(V3) is open.

We have TxM = (Eui2)x + Esx for x∈O(V3), as this holds for [formula], Eui2 and Es are Tf-invariant, and [formula].

We prove that (Eui2)x  ⊂  (Euj)x for every j < i and [formula]. Let [formula]. Then x∉Wu(Ωi) and then x∈O(Q3). Since (Eui2)x  ⊂  (Euj)x for [formula], it also holds for [formula] by the Tf-invariance of Eui2 and Euj.

Finally, let Ui be an open neighborhood of Ωi such that [formula]. Let N > 0. We prove that Eui2 is Cα and df-Lipschitz on [formula]. Consider the Grassmanian bundle G over M consisting of all [formula]-dimensional subspaces of the tangent spaces of M. Then Eui2 can be viewed as a Tf-invariant continuous section s of G|O(V3) which is Cα and df-Lipschitz on each fn(V3). Embed the compact manifold G into some [formula]. Then s can be viewed as a bounded map [formula]. Since [formula] for all n, there exists d1 > 0 such that for - N  ≤  n  ≤  N, x∈fn(Ui),y∈M,d(x,y) < d1 imply that y∈fn(V3). Let K' > 0 be such that |s(x) - s(y)|  ≤  K'ρf(x,y) for x,y∈fn(V3), - N  ≤  n  ≤  N. We prove that s is Cα and df-Lipschitz on [formula]. Let [formula]. Since s is bounded, we may assume that d(x,y) < d1. Suppose x∈fn(Ui). Then y∈fn(V3). Hence |s(x) - s(y)|  ≤  K'ρf(x,y). So the neighborhood Ui of Ωi and the bundle Eui = Eui2|O(Ui) satisfy the conditions (i')-(iv'). The proof of Theorem [\ref=T:1] is finished.

Existence of right inverses

Let f be a C2 diffeomorphism of a compact manifold M, α∈(0,1). Let [formula] denote the Banach space of continuous vector fields on M with the C0 norm [formula], and let [formula] be the subspace of [formula] consisting of Cα and df-Lipschitz vector fields. As in the previous section, suppose M is isometrically embedded into some Euclidian space [formula]. For [formula], denote

[formula]

[formula]

Then [formula], being endowed with the norm

[formula]

is a Banach space. For [formula], define the vector field [formula] on M by

[formula]

Then [formula] is in [formula], and in [formula] if [formula].

The following theorem is motivated by [\cite=R1] and [\cite=R2].

Let f be a C2 diffeomorphism of M satisfying Axiom A and the strong transversality condition, λ,l be as in Theorem [\ref=T:1]. Suppose α∈(0,1) satisfies λlα < 1. Then there exists a continuous linear operator J on [formula] such that (i) J is a right inverse of [formula]; (ii) J maps [formula] into [formula] and restricts to a continuous linear operator on [formula] with respect to the norm [formula].

Choose λ  <  λ' < ρ  =  κλ' < 1 such that ρlα < 1. Let [formula] be the spectral decomposition ordered as in Theorem [\ref=T:1]. Let Ui be an open neighborhood of Ωi, Eσi be two Tf-invariant subbundles of TM|O(Ui) satisfying (i)-(iv) in Theorem [\ref=T:1] for the above λ', σ = u,s. It is well known that [formula]. So there exists N > 0 such that [formula] is a cover of M. Shrinking Ui if necessary, we may assume that they are unrevisited. Then it is easy to see that for every x∈M, the set [formula] contains at most n0 = 2kN elements. Let [formula] be a smooth partition of unity subordinate to the above cover. For [formula], let ηiσ = PEσi(θiη), where PEsi (resp. PEui) is the projection of TMO(Ui) onto Esi (resp. Eui) along Eui (resp. Esi), and define [formula], [formula], [formula]. Robbin [\cite=R1] proved that these series converge uniformly, and then J is a continuous right inverse of [formula]. We prove in the following that J maps [formula] into [formula] and restricts to a continuous linear operator on [formula]. As in [\cite=R1], it is sufficient to prove this property for each Jis.

Let [formula]. Fix [formula], and denote ζ  =  ηis = PEsi(θiη). Then [formula] and ζ(x)∈(Esi)x for [formula]. Since Esi and Eui are Cα and df-Lipschitz on [formula], [formula]. Let [formula]. It is proved in [\cite=R1] that

[formula]

for all x∈M and [formula] (note that we always have [formula]). Hence

[formula]

for all [formula]. Let

[formula]

where Lα(Tf) is the Hölder constant of Tf as a map x  ↦  Txf for x∈M, Lα(PEsj|Uj) is the Hölder constant of PEsj|Uj as a map x  ↦  P(Esj)x for x∈Uj. We prove that

[formula]

for all [formula], where [formula].

We first prove some inequalities on individual tangent vectors. Let p,q∈M, vp∈TpM,vq∈TqM. Then

[formula]

Recall that a smooth adapted Riemannian metric on M can be obtained by approximating a C0 adapted metric for which the bundles Eu and Es are mutually orthogonal on Ω. So after choosing a better approximation of the C0 metric and shrinking the Uj's, we may assume that for each j, [formula] for every p∈Uj, where κ > 1 is as in the beginning of the proof. So for p,q,vp,vq as above, if moreover we have p,q∈Uj for some j, and vp∈(Esj)p,vq∈(Esj)q, then

[formula]

Now we prove [\eqref=E:vecHol]. Let [formula]. If one of f- n(x) and f- n(y) does not belong to [formula], say [formula], then by [\eqref=E:vecC0], we have

[formula]

So [\eqref=E:vecHol] holds in this case. Suppose [formula]. Let 1  ≤  m  ≤  n. Then by letting [formula], [formula] in [\eqref=E:v-bad] and using [\eqref=E:fieldC0], we get

[formula]

If moreover f- m(x),f- m(y)∈Uj for some j  ≥  i, then [formula], [formula]. By [\eqref=E:v-good] and [\eqref=E:fieldC0],

[formula]

For 1  ≤  m  ≤  n, denote

[formula]

Then by [\eqref=E:f-bad] and [\eqref=E:f-good], we have

[formula]

Since we have supposed that [formula], we have f- (n - N)(x), f- (n - N)(y)∈O+(Ui). But [formula] for j < i. So each of the sets [formula] and [formula] consists of at most n0 elements. Then for all but at most 2n0 + N integers m in [formula], f- m(x),f- m(y)∈Uj for some j  ≥  i, that is, at most 2n0 + N numbers νm(1  ≤  m  ≤  n) equal to [formula]. So we have [formula]. Then by [\eqref=E:f], we get

[formula]

This proves [\eqref=E:vecHol].

Recall that ζ  =  ηis. By [\eqref=E:vecHol], we have

[formula]

Similarly, we can prove that

[formula]

for some constant A,B > 0 (see [\cite=R1]). Since the bundles Esi and Eui are Cα and df-Lipschitz on [formula], the operator on [formula] which maps η to ηis is continuous. So by [\eqref=E:fieldC0], [\eqref=E:JHol] and [\eqref=E:JLip], the operator Jis maps [formula] into [formula] and is continuous on [formula]. This proves the theorem.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=T:main2]

In this section we prove Theorem [\ref=T:main2]. As indicated in the introduction, Theorem [\ref=T:main] follows from Theorem [\ref=T:main2].

We first extract some analytical arguments in [\cite=R1] [\cite=R2] to the following lemma, which can be viewed as a generalization of the usual Implicit Function Theorem for Banach spaces.

Let [formula] be a Banach space, X' be a linear subspace of X with a complete norm [formula] such that the inclusion [formula] is continuous, and such that the closed unit ball [formula] in X' is a closed subset of [formula]. Let M be a Banach manifold, f∈M, U be an open set in X containing 0∈X. Let Ψ:M  ×  U  →  X be a C1 map satisfying Ψ(f,0) = 0 and [formula]. Denote by A = D2Ψ(f,0):X  →  X the partial derivative of Ψ at the point (f,0) along the second variable. Suppose (1) A(X')  ⊂  X'; (2) 1 - A has a continuous linear right inverse J which maps X' into X' and restricts to a continuous linear operator on X'; (3) for any ε > 0, there exist a neighborhood Mε of f in M and a neighborhood Uε of 0 in U such that

[formula]

for all g∈Mε, [formula]. Then for any neighborhood V  ⊂  X' of 0 in [formula], there exist a neighborhood N of f in M and a map c:N  →  V such that (i) c(f) = 0; (ii) Ψ(g,c(g)) = c(g) for all g∈N; (iii) as a map N  →  X, c is C1.

Denote the norm of J as a operator on X by [formula], and the norm of J|X' as a operator on X' by [formula]. Choose [formula] such that the closed ball [formula] lies in V. By the condition (3) and the continuous differentiability of Ψ, we may choose an open neighborhood N of f in M and r > 0 such that the closed ball [formula] lies in U, and such that

[formula]

for all g∈N,x∈B(r), and

[formula]

for all [formula]. By making N smaller, we may also assume that

[formula]

for all g∈N.

For g∈N, define a map Rg:B(r)  →  X by

[formula]

Then for x∈B(r), by [\eqref=E:l1], [\eqref=E:l3] and the Mean Value Theorem, we have

[formula]

So Rg maps B(r) into B(r). For x,y∈B(r), also by [\eqref=E:l1] and the Mean Value Theorem, we have

[formula]

So Rg is a contraction on B(r). By the Contraction Principle, there is a unique fixed point c(g) of Rg in B(r). This means that (1 - A)(c(g)) = (1 - A)(Rg(c(g))) = Ψ(g,c(g)) - A(c(g)). So Ψ(g,c(g)) = c(g). It is obvious that c(f) = 0.

We prove that c(g)∈V. Let [formula]. Then [formula], and it is obvious by induction that xn∈X'. We have xn + 1 = Rg(xn) = J(Ψ(g,xn) - A(xn). By [\eqref=E:l2], we get [formula], which is equivalent to

[formula]

By induction we easily get [formula] for all [formula]. Hence [formula]. But the closed ball B'(ε) in X' is closed in X and xn  →  c(g) in X. So c(g)∈B'(ε)  ⊂  V.

The proof of the fact that c as a map N  →  X is C1 is the same as the proof of the corresponding result in the usual Implicit Function Theorem. We omit the details here.

The map [formula] between Banach manifolds defined by

[formula]

is C1 (see, for example, [\cite=Fr]). Let (U0,φ) be a coordinate chart around the identity map id in C0(M,M), where the coordinate [formula] is provided by the exponential map associated with some Riemannian metric on M, that is, φ(h)(x) =  exp - 1x(h(x)). φ maps the set of Cα and df-Lipschitz maps in U0 onto [formula]. Let U  ⊂  U0 be an open neighborhood of id in C0(M,M), M be an open neighborhood of f in [formula], such that Ψ(M  ×  U)  ⊂  U0. By abuse of language, we identify U0 with φ(U0) via the coordinate φ. But we denote an element in U0 by h when we view it as a map, and by η if it is regarded as a vector field.

The partial derivative [formula] of Ψ at the point (f,id) equals to [formula]. Since f is C2, D2Ψ(f,id) maps [formula] into [formula]. By Theorem [\ref=T:2], 1 - D2Ψ(f,id) has a right inverse J which restricts to a continuous linear operator on [formula].

To apply Lemma [\ref=L:implicit], we need to verify the following two conditions. (1) The closed unit ball in [formula] is a closed subset in [formula]; (2) For every ε > 0, there exist a neighborhood Mε  ⊂  M of f and δ > 0 such that [formula] for all [formula] with [formula].

To prove (1), let (ηn)∞n = 1 be a sequence in the closed unit ball in [formula], that is, [formula] for all n. Suppose [formula] such that [formula]. Then [formula]. By letting n  →    ∞   in the inequality [formula], we get [formula]. Similarly, [formula]. So [formula]. (1) is proved.

Denote [formula]. Let ε' > 0. Then

[formula]

for g sufficiently C1 close to f and [formula] sufficiently small. By considering the partial differentials of the C1 map M  ×  TM  →  TM,(g,x,v)  ↦  (f(x), exp - 1f(x)(g( exp x(v)))) along the directions of x and v (see [\cite=R1] or [\cite=R2]), we have

[formula]

whenever g is sufficiently C1 close to f and [formula] is sufficiently small, from which we easily get

[formula]

[formula]

for such g and η if [formula], where [formula] is the diameter of M. By [\eqref=E:b1], [\eqref=E:b2] and [\eqref=E:b3], we have

[formula]

for g sufficiently C1 close to f and [formula] with [formula] sufficiently small. This proves (2).

Let V be a Cα neighborhood of id in Cα(M,M) as in Theorem [\ref=T:main2]. Then we may choose a neighborhood Vf of id in the Banach manifold Cαf(M,M) of Cα and df-Lipschitz maps on M such that Vf  ⊂  V, and such that elements in Vf are sufficiently df-Lipschitz close to the identity. Applying Lemma [\ref=L:implicit] to the map Ψ, we get a C1 neighborhood N of f in [formula] and a function c:N  →  Vf with c(f) = id such that Ψ(g,c(g)) = gc(g)f- 1 = c(g) for every g∈N, and c is C1 as a map N  →  C0(M,M). It is easy to show that if c(g) is sufficiently df-Lipschitz close to the identity, then c(g) is a homeomorphism (see [\cite=R1] [\cite=R2]). So g = c(g)fc(g)- 1. This proves Theorem [\ref=T:main2].
