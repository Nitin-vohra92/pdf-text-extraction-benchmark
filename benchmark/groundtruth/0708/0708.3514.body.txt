Introduction

We deal with bivariate interpolation problems in an infinite field [formula] of characteristic 2. Characteristic 2 condition is not a very restrictive assumption because solvability of an interpolation problem in characteristic 2 implies solvability of the same problem in characteristic 0. Moreover working in characteristic 2 has many advantages. For instance, we do not need to take care of signs when we compute the determinants of matrices.

For the reader of this paper, an acquaintance with the notions and methods in [\cite=BM:top], [\cite=LJR] would be very useful. We more or less follow the notations of [\cite=LL:biv]. Given a fixed set S of lattice points (i,j),i,j  ≥  0, the sub-linear system P(S) with respect to S consists of

[formula]

Notice that unlike in [\cite=LL:biv], we do not necessarily assume S to be a lower set.

Throughout this note, the coordinates of lattice points are always nonnegative. Let Tm be the triangle of all (i,j) with i + j  ≤  m - 1. Tm contains [formula] lattice points.

For a set of n distinct interpolation knots Z = {zq: = (xq,yq)}nq = 1 in [formula], it is interesting to study (sub-)linear systems of plane curves passing through Z with multiplicity ≥  mq at each point zq (for example, see [\cite=BM:top], [\cite=CM:degen], [\cite=CM:lin], [\cite=H:une], [\cite=LL:biv], [\cite=Na:hil], [\cite=Ha:nagata], [\cite=HR:nagata], [\cite=SS:nagata] and references therein). To put it in another way, we are interested in solving the interpolation problem

[formula]

Note that we do not necessarily require [formula]. As in [\cite=LL:biv], we say that an interpolation scheme is almost surely solvable or almost regular if ( * ) is solvable for almost all [formula]. Since the right hand sides in ( * ) are 0, our interpolation problem is almost regular if and only if ( * ) has only trivial solution for almost all Z. We remark that if S has a double element (i,j) then a nontrivial solution P = xiyj + xiyj exists hence the interpolation problem is never almost regular.

Since it is natural to ask which (sub-)linear systems are almost regular, there has been some interest in trying to understand it. But up to now, even in the case n = |Z| = 1 there have been no explicit criterions in positive characteristic, and no other criterions in characteristic 0 than Bezout-Dumnicki lemma [\cite=Du:red] which gives a sufficient but not necessary condition for a (sub-)linear system to be almost regular.

In this note, we completely solve the interpolation problem in characteristic 2 in the case when n = |Z| = 1 and m = m1 = 2t [formula]. In other words, given [formula], we describe all the sub-linear systems generated by monomials, in which there is no curve passing through a general point with multiplicity ≥  2t. This case is already interesting in its own right, and is indispensable for dealing with the cases of n  ≥  2 knots (c.f. [\cite=Du:red]).

When n = 1, our interpolation scheme 〈S,Tm〉 becomes

[formula]

Our main theorem shows that the interpolation problem 〈S,T2t〉 is inductive on t, in other words, almost regularity of 〈S,T2t + 1〉 can be determined by some interpolation problems with T2t.

Let [formula] be an infinite field of characteristic 2. The following statements are equivalent. (i) The interpolation problem 〈S,T2t + 1〉 is almost regular. (ii) There is no triple [formula], [formula], [formula] [formula]see Definition  [\ref=def_hvd][formula] of subsets such that

[formula]

The following two corollaries are often useful in practice.

If the interpolation problem 〈S,T2t + 1〉 is almost regular, then the three of [formula], [formula], and [formula] are all almost regular.

If at least two of the three interpolation problems [formula], [formula], and [formula] are almost regular, then the interpolation problem 〈S,T2t + 1〉 is almost regular.

For example, if S = {(0,0),(0,1), (1,0),(0,2), (1,1),(2,0), (1,2),(2,1), (3,0),(1,3)} and m = 22, then 〈S,T22〉

(see the preceding sentence of Definition  [\ref=def_hvd]) is almost regular because [formula]

and [formula]

are almost regular.

As an application of Theorem  [\ref=main], we show that, without the aid of a computer, the linear system of plane curves of degree 26 passing through 10 general base points with m1 = m2 = 9, m3 = ... = m10 = 8 is empty. Our future project is to generalize this to bigger multiplicity cases.

Definitions

Throughout this note, for each lattice point (i,j), the vector whose (a,b)-th component ((a,b)∈T2t) is [formula] will be denoted by vti,j. This is nothing but the vector consisting of the coefficients of a column in an interpolation matrix(c.f. [\cite=LL:biv] p.670). We always arrange (a,b)-components with respect to the total degree order, that is, [formula]. For example,

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

We say that S is 2t-independent if {vti,j|(i,j)∈S} are linearly independent. This is equivalent to saying that 〈S,T2t〉 is almost regular.

The problem of deciding whether S is 2t-independent can be reduced modulo 2t. Let [formula] and consider the natural projection ρ:S  →  Bt defined by (i,j)∈S  ↦  (x,y)∈Bt where [formula].

S is 2t-independent if and only if the image ρ(S), counting multiple elements, is 2t-independent.

It follows from the fact that if [formula] and 0  ≤  z  ≤  2t - 1 then [formula]

Thanks to Lemma  [\ref=mod_two_red], we can and will assume that S is a subset (possibly counting multiple elements) of Bt. Since we use induction on t in the proof of Theorem  [\ref=main], we will sometimes write a pair (Bt,S) in place of S  ⊂  Bt to avoid confusion. The visualization of (Bt,S) will be used frequently, for instance,

[formula]

Suppose that S  ⊂  Bt + 1 does not have multiple points. Then we define [formula] as follows. Given an element (i,j)∈Bt, the element (i,j) belongs to [formula] if and only if one of the four subsets

[formula]

is contained in S. If all the four are contained in S then we call (i,j) a double element. We notice that h stands for horizontal, v vertical, and d diagonal. Illustrations are given below.

[formula]

[formula] (resp. [formula]) can be similarly defined. In the above definition we replace ( ~ ) by

[formula]

To define [formula], [formula], [formula] respectively, we replace ( ~ ) by

[formula]

respectively.

Proofs

[formula]

[formula]

Before giving a proof, we introduce some notations. Let Vt be the [formula]-dimensional vector space over [formula] consisting of (a,b)-components ((a,b)∈T2t), so that vti,j∈Vt. We decompose Vt + 1 into [formula], where Vtw consists of (a,b)-components with (a,b)∈Bt, Vty with b  ≥  2t, and Vtz with a  ≥  2t. As a matter of fact, we consider the following isomorphism of vector spaces:

[formula]

[formula]

where we have only rearranged the order of components. Note that [formula], [formula] [formula] and that Vty, Vtz, and Vt are isomorphic as vector spaces.

Seeking contradiction, suppose that there is a triple [formula], [formula], [formula] of subsets satisfying the three conditions in (†) in the statement of Theorem  [\ref=main]. Without loss of generality, we assume that U and V are nonempty.

By using the proof of Lemma  [\ref=mod_two_red], we observe that

and

Then

[formula]

and

[formula]

Suppose that there is a triple [formula], [formula], [formula] of subsets satisfying the three conditions in (†) in the statement of Theorem  [\ref=main]. Then we have

[formula]

By ( ~ ) and ( ~ ), we have

[formula]

Applying the same argument as in ( ~ ) or ( ~ ) for [formula], we get

[formula]

On the other hand, since [formula], [formula] and [formula] satisfy the first condition in (†), we have [formula], [formula] and [formula].

Adding ( ~ ) and ( ~ ) together gives

[formula]

We observe that [formula] and [formula] imply [formula]. So, by Definition  [\ref=def_hvd], if (i,j)∈U  -  V then either {(i,j),(i + 2t,j)} or {(i,j + 2t),(i + 2t,j + 2t)} is contained in S. In the same manner, [formula]. If (i,j)∈V - U then either {(i,j),(i + 2t,j + 2t)} or {(i,j + 2t),(i + 2t,j)} is contained in S. It is obvious that if [formula] then either {(i,j),(i,j + 2t)} or {(i + 2t,j),(i + 2t,j + 2t)} is contained in S.

So Lemma  [\ref=lastvecsum] implies that there is a nonempty subset S' of S such that [formula]. Therefore (Bt + 1,S) is not 2t + 1-independent.

[formula]

Suppose that (Bt + 1,S) is not 2t + 1-independent. Then there is a nonempty minimal subset S' of S such that [formula].

[formula] for any (i,j)∈Bt.

To prove this lemma, we need the following claims. Let wi,j  =  τ1(vt + 1i,j) where τ1 is the natural projection [formula].

wi,j ((i,j)∈Bt) are linearly independent.

It is easy to see that the matrix in which columns wi,j are arranged with respect to the total degree order is an upper triangle matrix with diagonal (1,1,...,1).

For any (i,j)∈Bt, the vectors wi,j,wi,j + 2t,wi + 2t,j,wi + 2t,j + 2t are identical.

This is essentially the same as the proof of Lemma  [\ref=mod_two_red].

Since the vector [formula] is the zero vector, its image under τ1:Vt + 1  →  Vtw is also zero vector. So we have

[formula]

where we have used Claim  [\ref=identical]. Then, by Claim  [\ref=lin_ind], [formula] for every (i,j)∈Bt. This completes the proof of Lemma  [\ref=even].

If [formula] for some (i,j)∈Bt, then {(i,j),(i,j + 2t),(i + 2t,j),(i + 2t,j + 2t)}  ⊂  S'  ⊂  S. Then by definition  [\ref=def_hvd], [formula] [formula] also) has a double element hence is not 2t-independent.

So we assume that [formula] or 2 for any (i,j)∈Bt. Of course we consider only (i,j)∈Bt with [formula]. For each of such (i,j), depending on elements in [formula], we consider one and only one of the three vectors

[formula]

or

[formula]

These give rise to three disjoint (possibly empty but not all empty) subsets S1,S2,S3 of Bt such that

[formula]

[formula]

We show that the triple [formula], [formula], [formula] satisfies the three conditions in (†) in the statement of Theorem  [\ref=main]. Recall that [formula]. This implies that

[formula]

hence

[formula]

Thus the first condition follows.

Since at least one of S1,S2,S3 is nonempty, at most one of [formula], [formula], and [formula] is empty. The last condition follows from S1,S2,S3 being disjoint. Proof of Theorem  [\ref=main] is completed.

If one, say [formula], of the three is not almost regular, then there is a nontrivial solution of ( *  * ). Let [formula] be one of the solutions. If [formula] and W = U then the triple (U,V,W) satisfies the three conditions in (†) in the statement of Theorem  [\ref=main]. So 〈S,T2t + 1〉 is not almost regular.

Without loss of generality, suppose that [formula] and [formula] are almost regular. If 〈S,T2t + 1〉 were not almost regular, then there would be a triple (U,V,W) satisfying the three conditions in (†). But since U and V are empty, (U,V,W) cannot satisfy the third condition.

Application

We show that the linear system of plane curves of degree d = 26 passing through 10 general base points with m1 = m2 = 9, m3 = ... = m10 = 8 is empty. In this case, S = Td + 1 = T27. We apply Dumnicki-Jarnicki reduction method [\cite=DJ:new] and Dumnicki's cutting diagram method [\cite=Du:red] to 8 points z1,...,z8. Then we use Theorem  [\ref=main] several times to check that the division below determines a unique nonzero (in characteristic 2) monomial of the form [formula] in the determinant of the interpolation matrix ( * ). We remark that Bezout-Dumnicki lemma ([\cite=Du:red], Lemma 20) does not work in positive characteristic and that even in characteristic zero, it cannot cover the central region corresponding to the point z10.
