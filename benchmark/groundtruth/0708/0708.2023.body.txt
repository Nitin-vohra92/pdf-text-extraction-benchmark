Nonantagonistic noisy duels of discrete type with an arbitrary number of actions

Introduction

The classical duel is a zero-sum game of two players of the following type. The players have certain resources and use them during a given time interval with the goal of achieving success. Use of the resource γ at the moment t leads to success with the probability depending on the amount of resource γ and the time t only (it is usually assumed that the probability of success increases with time). As soon as one player achieves the goal he receives his profit, which is equal to his opponent's loss, and the game ends. Various assumptions about the ways players use their resources and about players receiving information about the opponent's behavior during the game define various kinds of duels [\cite=kar] [\cite=kimoverview]. Models were considered where players' resources were discrete (discrete firing duels), infinitely divisible (continuous firing duels), continuous for one of the players and discrete for the other one (mixed duels, or fighter-bomber duels) [\cite=pdn] [\cite=pnr]. Researchers studied noisy duels [\cite=fk] [\cite=pdn] [\cite=ran], where every player at a given moment of time had complete information about his opponent's behavior up to that moment, and silent duels, where no such information was available. At present time duels are considered as classical models of competition [\cite=kar] [\cite=pmixsin]. However, their application as such is somewhat limited by the assumption that the players' interests are strictly opposite to each other. Games of the duel type with nonzero sum belong to an unexplored class of infinite games with nonopposite interests.

A nonzero-sum game which is a generalization of the classical antagonistic duel was first considered in [\cite=pnozmixn]; it was a nonantagonistic noisy fighter-bomber duel. Then nonzero-sum duels were studed in [\cite=ndst], [\cite=fpm], [\cite=pareto].

In this paper we study a nonzero-sum game of two players which is a generalization of the antagonistic noisy duel with discrete firing [\cite=fk] [\cite=fox]. This paper is an extended verion of [\cite=fpm2] with complete proofs. It is also a sequel to [\cite=fpm].

Preliminaries from Game Theory

A game of two players is a quadruple

[formula]

where X and Y are sets of the players' strategies and Kj(x,y),  j = 1,2 are the players' payoff functions, which are defined on the Carthesian product X  ×  Y and determine the j-th player's payoff when Player I uses a strategy x∈X and Player II uses a strategy y∈Y. A game Γ is called a zero-sum game of two players, or an antagonistic game if K1(x,y) + K2(x,y) = 0 for all x∈X, y∈Y and a nonzero-sum game of two players, or a nonantagonistic game otherwise. The mixed extension of a game Γ is the game [formula], where Φ and Ψ are the sets of distributions on X and Y and [formula] (j = 1,2) are the mean values of the payoff functions Kj(x,y) over the distributions φ∈Φ, ψ∈Ψ. Pure strategies of the game [formula] are distributions concentrated in one point x∈X or y∈Y, respectively. All the other distributions φ∈Φ, ψ∈Ψ are called mixed strategies.

A situation (x,y) is a pair of the player's strategies. A situation (xe,ye) is called an equilibrium situation if for all x∈X, y∈Y the following inequalities hold:

[formula]

The vector (v1,v2), where v1 = K1(xe,ye) and v2 = K2(xe,ye), is called the equilibrium value corresponding to the equilibrium situation (xe,ye), and a strategy included in some equilibrium situation is called an equilibrium strategy.

An infinite game with nonantagonistic interests may not admit an equilibrium situation. A situation (xε,yε) is called an ε-equilibrium situation if for any x∈X, y∈Y the following inequalities hold:

[formula]

A player's strategy included in some ε-equilibrium situation will be called an ε-equilibrium strategy. If the limits

[formula]

exist, the vector (v1,v2) will be called the equilibrium value corresponding to a set of ε-equilibrium situations {(xε,yε)}.

A strategy xm∈X is called a maxmin strategy of Player I if the function [formula] attains its maximal value in it. Analogously, a strategy ym∈Y is called a maxmin strategy of Player II if the function [formula] attains its maximal value in it. The vector

[formula]

is called the maxmin value of a nonzero-sum game. The value wj is the best guaranteed payoff of the j-th player.

In an infinite game maxmin strategies may not exist. In this case ε-maxmin strategies are considered. A strategy xεm∈X is called an ε-maxmin strategy of Player I if

[formula]

and w1 is called the maxmin value of the game of Player I. Analogously one defines an ε-maxmin strategy of Player II: a strategy yεm∈X is called an ε-maxmin strategy of Player II if

[formula]

and w2 is called the maxmin value of the game of Player II.

If an antagonistic game admits equilibrium situations, then the equilibrium values corresponding to them coincide and are equal to the maxmin value. Equilibrium strategies of an antagonistic game are maxmin and they are called optimal, while ε-equilibrium values are ε-maxmin and they are called ε-optimal. A nonzero-sum game may admit equilibrium situations with unequal equilibrium values.

Let us introduce a partial order relation [formula] in [formula]:

[formula]

where at least one of the inequalities is strict. Denote by S the set of all situations s = (x,y). The relation of Pareto preference on the set S is defined as follows. Let si = (xi,yi) (i = 1,2). Then

[formula]

A situation sp = (xp,yp) is called Pareto-optimal if there are no situations s = (x,y) such that [formula].

In an antagonistic game all the situations are Pareto-optimal. A game is called quasi-antagonistic, or a game with opposite interests, if all the situations of the game are Pareto-optimal, i. e., if for any two situations (x1,y1),(x2,y2)∈S the following conditions hold:

[formula]

Posing the problem

Consider a nonzero-sum game of two players which is a generalization of the antagonistic noisy duel with discrete firing.

The players compete in the conditions of complete information. They have discrete resources [formula] which they use during the time interval

[formula]

τ'=(τ,,τ);  η'=(η,,η).

[formula]

Situations of [formula]-equilibrium

There exists a set [formula] such that

[formula]

and for all [formula] the following inequalities hold:

[formula]

Set

[formula]

Choose ε > 0 and find δj (j = 1,2) such that

[formula]

Take δ  =   min {δ1,δ2}. Let μ, ν be the current values of the players' resources and φεμν be the uniform distribution concentrated in the interval

[formula]

K=A;  K=-B.

[formula]

K=-B;  K=A.

[formula]

v=A;  v=-B;  v=-B;  v=A.

[formula]

Pareto-optimal plays

The pair p = (τ,η) of vectors of action moments realized during the game is called a play. Let us denote the set of all plays of a noisy duel [formula] by P. Note that P is a subset of the set of all situations of the corresponding silent duel (with the same effectivess functions, resources, and vectors of profit and loss). Namely, P includes exactly those situations of the silent duel in which after one of the players has used all of his resource, the other one postpones his action until the moment t = 1. A play p1∈P is called Pareto-optimal if there exist no p2∈P such that [formula]. Plays p1 and p2 are called incomparable if [formula] and [formula]. Plays p1 = (τ1,η1) and p2 = (τ2,η2) are called equivalent if Kj(τ1,η1) = Kj(τ2,η2) (j = 1,2).

A play p = (τ,η)∈P is called a T-play if for any k, l [formula]; [formula] at least one of the following two equations holds

[formula]

where k, l are the current resources of the players.

Let pT = (τT,ηT) be an arbitrary T-play with noncoinciding action moments of the players, i. e., τk  ≠  ηl for all [formula], [formula]. Then

[formula]

Let us prove Lemma by induction on the number of action moments of the players. For n = 0, m > 0 or m = 0, n > 0 the assertion is true as v1m0 = A1; v2m0 =  - B2, v10n =  - B1; v20n = A2. Assume that the statement is true for all pairs (k,l) such that [formula]; [formula]; k + l < m + n and prove it for (k,l) = (m,n). Suppose that Player I acts at the moment t = tmn. Then using the recursive formula [\eqref=4a] for τm  <  ηn and the inductive assumptions we obtain

[formula]

Suppose that Player II acts at the moment of time tmn. Then using the formula [\eqref=4a] for τm  >  ηn and the inductive assumptions we obtain

[formula]

The second player's payoff fuction is considered in the analogous way.

Let the plays p1 = (τ1,η1), p2 = (τ2,η2)∈P satisfy the conditions

[formula]

Then we have (1) if [formula], then [formula]; (2) if [formula], then [formula].

Express the payoff function of the plays p1 and p2 in the following way:

[formula]

Consider the difference K1(τ1,η1) - K1(τ2,η2). Taking in account that by Lemma [\ref=l.0]

[formula]

we have:

[formula]

Analogously,

[formula]

The statement of Lemma follows from [\eqref=l3.1], [\eqref=l3.2].

A duel may have one of four alternative results: H0 -- no one of players achieves success; H1 -- Player I achieves success; H2 -- Player II achieves success; H3 -- both players achieve success simultaneously. We denote the probability of the result Hi in play (τ,η) by Qi(τ,η) (i = 0,1,2,3). Then:

[formula]

Success of both players is possible only if they act simultaneously, because if one of the players achieves success, the game stops. As the payoff function Kj(τ;η) is the mathematical expectation of profit, so

[formula]

By [\eqref=eqno3], we have:

[formula]

Denote by P'  ⊂  P the set of plays with noncoinsiding action times in which τ1 = 1 or η1 = 1. The complement [formula] includes plays in which the players use their last units of resource simultaneously.

Let p' = (τ',η')∈P' and [formula]. In this case

(1) if [formula], then A1A2 > B1B2;  (2) if [formula], then A1A2 < B1B2.

Let (τ',η')∈P', so the relations [\eqref=eqno5], [\eqref=eqno6] reduce to the form:

[formula]

Consider the differences Δj = Kj(τ,η) - Kj(τ',η'). Applying the formulas [\eqref=eqno5], [\eqref=eqno6], [\eqref=eqno7], [\eqref=eqno7a] we get:

[formula]

where

[formula]

Let us prove the first assertion of Lemma. If [formula], then [formula], [formula] and at least one of this inequalities is strict. Since Aj + Bj > 0 (j = 1,2), it follows from [\eqref=eqno8], [\eqref=eqno9] that

[formula]

Since Q(τ,η)  ≠  0 for [formula], combining the inequalities [\eqref=eqno11], [\eqref=eqno11a] and taking in account that at least one of them is strict, we get:

[formula]

The second statement of the lemma is proved in the analogous way.

Let p1,p2∈P'. Then p1 and p2 are Pareto-incomparable.

If p = (τ,η)∈P', then from the relations [\eqref=eqno7], [\eqref=eqno7a] it follows that:

[formula]

The statement of Lemma immediately follows from [\eqref=eqno12].

If in the game Γmn(P,A,B) the coefficients of profit and loss of the players satisfy the condition

[formula]

then the game is quasi-antagonistic.

In the paper [\cite=pareto] a similar theorem about a sufficient condition of quasi-antagonisticity was also proven for continuous and discrete duels.

Note that if the relation [\eqref=P2] holds, then there exists a number λ > 0 such that

[formula]

Indeed, suppose A1A2 > 0. Then accoding to [\eqref=P2] B1B2 > 0 and A1 / B2 = B1 / A2. In this case from the formulas [\eqref=eqno4], [\eqref=eqno4a] one can see that [\eqref=eqno14] holds with λ = A1 / B2. Suppose that one of the numbers A1 or A2 is equal to zero. If A1 = 0, then by [\eqref=I1] we have B1  ≠  0, and from [\eqref=P2] it follows B2 = 0, A2  ≠  0. Then in view of the relations [\eqref=eqno4], [\eqref=eqno4a] we conclude that the equation [\eqref=eqno14] holds with λ = B1 / A2. The case A2 = 0 is considered in the similar way. So it is proved that there exists λ > 0 for which the equation [\eqref=eqno14] holds. It follows from [\eqref=eqno14] that the game is quasi-antagonistic.

If the coefficients of profit and loss of the players are related by the inequality [formula], then T-plays with noncoinciding action moments of the players are Pareto-optimal.

If A1A2 = B1B2, then by Theorem [\ref=t.6] all plays are Pareto-optimal. In any T-play with noncoinciding action moments the last action of a player happens at t = 1, i. e., max {τ1,η1} = 1. Suppose A1A2 > B1B2. We will show that [formula] for any plays p∈P, p'∈P'. There are two cases to be considered.

p∈P'. Then by Lemma [\ref=l.6] [formula].

[formula]. By Lemma [\ref=l.5], if [formula] then A1A2 < B1B2 in contradiction to the assumption of the theorem. Therefore [formula].

If [formula], then T-plays with noncoinciding action moments of the players are not Pareto-optimal.

Since according to Lemma [\ref=l.1] all the T-plays with noncoinciding action moments of the players are equivalent, we will give the proof for one T-play only, namely for the play p1 = (τ,η) in which

[formula]

Set

[formula]

The plays p1,p2 satisfy the conditions of Lemma [\ref=l.4], therefore

[formula]

Thus the T-play p1 and all the other T-plays with noncoinciding action moments of the players are not Pareto-optimal.

If the duel Γmn(P,A,B) is quasi-antagonistic, then one of the following two conditions holds:

[formula]

Assume that the plays p1,p2 satisfy the conditions [\eqref=l4.1], [\eqref=l4.3]. Suppose that no one of the conditions ([\ref=P1]) holds. Then the following two cases are possible.

[formula]. Then according to the statement (1) of Lemma [\ref=l.4] one has [formula]. Therefore the play p2 is not Pareto-optimal, and so the game is not quasi-antagonistic.

[formula]. Then according to the statement (2) of Lemma [\ref=l.4] one has [formula]. Therefore the play p1 is not Pareto-optimal, and so the game is not quasi-antagonistic.
