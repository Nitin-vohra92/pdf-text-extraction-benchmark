Introduction

Spin properties of the baryons within the frame of the Skyrme model are studied since early eighties [\cite=ANW]. The key moment of these researches is the use of the moduli space approximation (MSA). Such an approach is not a consecutive theory. It is of artificial character and assumes obligatory existence of the static soliton solution. Degeneration parameters of these solutions are regarded as the collective variables while studying the internal dynamics of solitons. Such a choice of the collective variables does not make possible to describe various nucleon resonances. Besides, it does not allow to take into account the dynamic deformation of solitons. Solution of the mentioned problems can be found only on the base of complete dynamic description (CDD) [\cite=Ts]. This description assumes the use of the variational approach to the collective variables formalism and the employment of the complete set of cyclic coordinates as such variables. Thus, while describing nucleon and its resonances, the configurational space consists of group parameters describing spin rotation and group parameters related to isotopic rotation. This theory shows that at the classical level the nucleon and delta-isobar states are exact solutions of the motion equations at which rotations in the spin and isospin space are synchronous. The last circumstance allows to formulate a simplified theory, the configurational space of which is described by one set of SU(2) group parameters, reflecting a synchronous rotation of particles in isotopic and spin spaces. Obviously, this theory cannot describe the entire variety of nucleon resonances, but it will allow to solve some of the problems mentioned above as applied to the nucleon and delta-isobar states. The creation of this scheme along with the assessment of its possibilities is given below.

Dynamics of the synchronous spin-isospin rotation

Lagrangian of the SU(2) invariant model of nucleon, written in terms of group parameters φi(x,t) can be presented in the form

[formula]

In order to provide the possibility for moderate soliton rotation, the Lagrangian includes mass term and depending on concrete form of the kinetic matrix gik(φ) and the potential term H(φ,0) can describe both SU(2) sigma-model and corresponding Skyrme model. The Lagrangian ( are invariant with respect to isotopic φ(x)  →  Tφ(x) and space rotations φ(x)  →  φ(Tx), where T is three-dimensional orthogonal matrix of the adjoint representation of SU(2). The conserved dynamic functionals of the isotopic and ordinary spin associated with the invariance properties mentioned have the form

[formula]

where [formula], [formula] are the kinematic operators of the isotopic spin and the angular momentum. The purpose of this work is to create a simplified version of the nucleon and delta-isobar description as compared to the CDD scheme of the work [\cite=Ts]. Therefore, let us use the results of this work and connect the collective motion only with the states that correspond to synchronous rotation of the system in isotopic and spin spaces. Then the corresponding collective variables can be introduced by means of the substitution

[formula]

where the role of these variables is played by group parameters ai of the matrix T. Unlike the work [\cite=Ts] in which spin and isotopic rotations are regarded as independent, the configurational space of the proposed theory contains only one set of group parameters and is similar to configurational space of the MSA approach. In this sense the following construction can be regarded as a certain modernization of the MSA approach. In order to provide for the nondegenerate nature of the suggested change of variables, we limit the admissible variations of the field φ(x) by the orthogonality conditions

[formula]

where [formula] is the gauge function. While describing the collective motion, the field φ(x) is defined as the extremal of the Hamiltonian with fixed values of the collective coordinates and momenta. This description can be essentially simplified by identifying gauge [formula] with the extremal of field φ(x). Then the canonical momentum conjugate to the field φ(x) vanish at the extremum point. That enables in describing purely collective motion to put velocities [formula] equal to zero [\cite=Ts]. In this case

[formula]

where the velocity form [formula] is defined by expression Using ( let us find the connection between canonical momenta and velocities where kinematic operators iks and symbols (DiDk) are defined by formulas Besides, using ( one can find the exact formulas, connecting canonical momenta and the integrals of motion of the system (

[formula]

Thus, we obtain the functional which at the extremum point defines the collective Hamiltonian of the system. Extremal of the field φ(x) should be determined taking into account the constraint ( If one takes into account the non-degeneracy of the matrice [formula] and formulas

[formula]

then in special gauge [formula] the constraint ( will assume the form Therefore, having created the projection operator we will find the following equation for the extremals of the field φ(x)

[formula]

Part of this equation, containing projection operator P, reflects the availability of non-compensated dynamic stresses in the system. If these stresses vanish, the equation ( turns into equation for stationary states of the Hamiltonian Hc(φ(Tx),σ). Having determined the time dependence of the matrix T under the action of the Hamiltonian Hc, one can obtain the exact dynamic solutions of the motion equation for the field φ(x). Let us analyze the conditions under which the dynamic stresses vanish. Using formulas ( one can find the obvious properties of the Hamiltonian Hc This relationship is valid for arbitrary φ(x), not limited by any additional conditions. Thus, differentiating it with respect to the parameters ai, one can find the identity

[formula]

Next, with the help of canonical brackets {ai,πk}  =  δik , one can find the following Poisson brackets Hence we derive the rates of change of the variables [formula] under the action of the collective Hamiltonian Hc Using these formulas and identity ( we obtain Since spin [formula] and isospin [formula] are the integrals of motion, the equation follows which defines dynamic stresses in the system. These stresses vanish, if

[formula]

We will seek a solution for the equation ( in the class of axially-symmetrical configurations [formula], where [formula] is unit vector in the direction of vector [formula]. In this case with the help of ( it is easy to show that [formula]. Since the solution for the matrix T can be presented as [formula], then the equation ( implies, that dynamic functional [formula] is a zero-mode of the operator [formula]. That is, [formula]. Multiplying this equation by [formula] and taking into account that [formula], we will find that c = 0, i.e., the dynamic stresses vanish on the states on which spin and isospin are rigidly bound by the condition

[formula]

Thus, in stationary case [formula], the equation for the field φ(x) takes the form If one presents symbols (DiDk) as [formula], then the inverse matrix can be written as [formula]. Therefore, the collective Hamiltonian, describing synchronous rotation of the soliton in isotopic and spin spaces, will take the form

[formula]

The obtained Hamiltonian properly coincides with the Hamiltonian, describing the nucleon and delta-isobar in the CDD formalism, which takes into account an independence of the spin and isospin rotation [\cite=Ts]. At the same time, Poisson brackets algebra of the dynamic functionals [formula] in ( and algebra of the functionals [formula], defining similar Hamiltonian in the CDD formalism, are different. It results in different quantum description of the nucleon and delta-isobar in the considered approach and in the scheme of the work [\cite=Ts]. From the formulas ( ( it follows that These expressions for spin and isospin coincide with the respective formulas of the work [\cite=ANW] with accuracy to parametrization. Besides, Hamiltonian Hc is the function of [formula]. Therefore, quantization of the collective motion leads to the same vectors of states for nucleon and delta-isobar as it does in case of using MSA [\cite=ANW].

Conclusion

As a result of above described analysis, the consecutive theoretical scheme was created whose configurational space is similar to that of the MSA approach. The scheme reproduces the results of the MSA approach and at the same time allows to overcome some difficulties inherent in mentioned approach. In particular, the method allows to take into account rotational deformation of the nucleon and delta-isobar, doesn't require an obligatory existence of the static soliton solution and makes possible to find dynamic soliton states in SU(2) sigma-model. In some sense one may say that the suggested scheme is a modernization of the MSA approach, based upon use of the fact of synchronous rotation of spin and isospin for the nucleon and delta-isobar states. At the same time the given scheme can not be regarded as an acceptable alternative to nucleon and delta-isobar description in the CDD formalism [\cite=Ts]. First of all field fluctuations in this approach have no clear physical meaning. These fluctuations are the mixture of true field fluctuations and the localized time-dependent states corresponding to resonances. In case of the CDD formalism, from the very beginning resonances are attributed to the soliton spectrum of the system and field fluctuations have direct sense of the low amplitude π meson field. For this reason the new approach gives inadequate quantum description of the studied particles. In particular the wave functions of these particles in MSA approach differ radically from those in the CDD formalism.
