Introduction

In the last five years analytical results from random matrix theory have been successfully applied in the investigation of Dirac operator eigenvalues provided by QCD lattice data (see [\cite=Jac] for a recent review). A crucial point for their applicability is the question of matrix model universality when replacing the Euclidean finite-volume QCD-partition function by its matrix model counter part:

[formula]

Here the chiral unitary ensemble with W N   ×   (N + ν) complex has been chosen as an example, which corresponds to QCD[formula] with Nf massless fermions, ν zeromodes and gauge group SU(Nc   ≥   3) in the fundamental representation. It is not fixed apriori which matrix model average exp ( - NV) is to be taken since it cannot be derived from the effective Yang-Mills action, that averages the determinant of the Dirac operator in QCD. The matrix model calculation, if applicable, should therefore be independent of the details of the potential V and thus be universal. This question has been entirely answered for the unitary ensembles in the phase where the chiral symmetry is broken [\cite=ADMN] [\cite=DN]. The link between the matrix model eigenvalue correlations and the chiral condensate is given by the Banks-Casher formula ρ(0)   =    | < q >  | / π [\cite=BC]. However, the matrix model potential V can be also tuned in such a way that the eigenvalue density at the origin ρ(0) vanishes. These multicritical points [\cite=Ka] may therefore serve as a class of models for the chiral phase transition, where the results presented here mainly summarize [\cite=ADMNII]. In contrast to [\cite=JVS] [\cite=Hal98] the transition is not driven by an external parameter introduced to model the effect of temperature T or finite baryon density μ in the matrix model.

The chiral phase transition at multicriticality

There are different large-N limits in which the matrix model eq.([\ref=Zmm]) can be investigated. In the macroscopic limit N(λi  -  λj)  ≫  1, where the λi are the eigenvalues of W, the eigenvalue density becomes a smooth function with finite support

[formula]

A new microscopic scaling limit

In the microscopic limit correlations of eigenvalues are considered which are in a distance of the order 1 / N. Since the spectrum of the Dirac operator close to the origin is of interest a scaling variable x   =   Nλ is defined and kept finite as N  →    ∞  . The rescaled microscopic eigenvalue density reads

[formula]

It is a universal function since it depends on the potential V only through the macroscopic density at zero, ρ(0), and thus it is parameterized by chiral condensate <  q >  only. This has been shown for the unitary ensembles for an arbitrary polynomial potential at any given Nf and ν for the massless [\cite=ADMN] and massive case [\cite=DN].

In order to extend universality to the multicritical points of the unitary ensembles the way to take the microscopic limit has to be modified. At the phase transition <  q >    →   0 the appropriate scaling behavior for the m-th multicritical point is found to be [\cite=ADMNII]

[formula]

and the microscopic density in terms of the new scaling variable reads

[formula]

The same phenomenon may be expected for the Dirac operator eigenvalues on the lattice at the transition. The new universality classes eq.([\ref=rhomth]) will be parameterized by ρ(2m)(0) in analogy to the broken phase [\cite=ADMNII]. Recently the multicritical behavior of a different matrix model with random and deterministic degrees of freedom has been studied [\cite=BH98]. The authors find a modification of the microscopic scaling at multicriticality as well, with exponents [formula], k ∈N. For k   =   1 such a model has been applied to the chiral phase transition [\cite=No98] (see proceedings).

Universality at multicritical points

In this section a brief summary of the analytical and numerical results of [\cite=ADMNII] is given. First the results for the unitary ensemble (QCD[formula])

[formula]

with potential [formula] are given and then extended to the chiral unitary ensemble. In order to determine correlation functions of eigenvalues a differential equation for the wavefunctions

[formula]

is derived following [\cite=KF] and then solved in the microscopic limit eq.([\ref=scale]). The Pn(λ) are polynomials orthonormal to the measure absorbed in the wavefunctions ψn(λ). The spectral kernel

[formula]

then determines all n-point correlation functions from taking its determinant. The set of polynomials Pn(λ) obeys the following properties

[formula]

where the boundary condition determining the recursion coefficients cn and the functions An(λ) and Bn(λ) can be found in [\cite=KF]. From eqs.([\ref=rec]) the authors derive that the wavefunctions satisfy the following differential equation for finite N

[formula]

where the FN(λ) and GN(λ) are given functions of AN, BN and the potential V as well as derivatives of them [\cite=KF]. Taking the scaling limit in the broken phase together with the relation [formula] ([\cite=KF]) leads to a universal differential equation for ψN(x) of Bessel type first derived in [\cite=ADMN]. When going to the m-th multicritical point in the scaling limit eq.([\ref=scale]) the resulting differential equation will no longer be solvable analytically, the FN(λ) and GN(λ) being rational functions [\cite=ADMNII].

In the simplest example the m   =   1-critical potential [formula] at g   =   16 leads to the following coefficients in terms of the scaling variable x   =   N1 / 3λ:

[formula]

The constants u±   =   g(2f2(0)  ±  f'(0)) and v   =   2gf(0) have to be determined numerically by solving an auxiliary Painlevé II equation for the recursion coefficients [\cite=CM] at z   =   0

[formula]

Still, the issue of universality of the two differential equations and thus of ψN(x) can be addressed analytically. Perturbing the critical quartic potential by a sextic term g6λ6 / 6 and maintaining ρ(λ)  ~  λ2 all expressions eqs.([\ref=FG]) and ([\ref=PII]) remain valid when replacing g  →  g*   =   g + g6 / 2. Thus g*   =   ρ''(0) / π plays the role of a universal parameter in the solution ψN(x) and via the kernel eq.([\ref=ker]) in all microscopic correlation functions. Below the numerical solution for the universal microscopic density eq.([\ref=rhomth]) for m   =   1 is given. The x2-growth is due to the matching condition lim x  →    ∞ρS''(x)   =   ρ''(0) (dotted line). Figure 1. The m   =   1 multicritical density at Nf   =   0 (left) and Nf   =   1 (right).

For higher m the functions FN(x) and GN(x) become much more involved. However, when making an approximation to the exact differential equation ([\ref=diff]) in the scaling limit ([\ref=scale]) it is possible to obtain an equation which is analytically solvable for any m. Imposing

[formula]

on x for the critical potentials ([\ref=Vcrit]) leads to the approximate equation

[formula]

which is again of Bessel type. Here the constant k(m)   =   2πρ(2m)(0) / (2m)! has been replaced. The solution reads

[formula]

The appearance of the parameter ρ(2m)(0) in the approximate solutions makes it highly suggestive to conjecture new universality classes for all multicritical points with m   ≥   2 .

The above results can be easily translated to the multicritical chiral unitary ensembles. The wavefunctions ψ̃n(λ) corresponding to the partition function eq.([\ref=Zmm]) can be simply related to those of the unitary ensemble above

[formula]

when shifting Nf in eq.([\ref=Z]) by ν + 1 / 2. The approximate analytic solution can thus be immediately read off from eq.([\ref=psimeso]). The final expression for the approximate microscopic density of the m-th multicritical chiral unitary ensemble reads

[formula]

with [formula]. It matches to the exact noncritical density for m   =   0 [\cite=ADMN].
