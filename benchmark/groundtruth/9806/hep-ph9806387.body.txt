Introduction. It is now understood that neutrino oscillations can describe the data on the solar neutrino deficit [\cite=SSM] [\cite=solar] [\cite=newsolar], the atmospheric neutrino anomaly [\cite=atmos] [\cite=SuperK] [\cite=oldatmos], and the results from the LSND experiment [\cite=LSND], only if a sterile neutrino is introduced [\cite=models] [\cite=bgg] [\cite=bww97] [\cite=gmnr98] [\cite=bpww]. However, because confirmation of the LSND results awaits future experiments [\cite=LSNDconfirm], a conservative approach is to assume that oscillations need only account for the solar and atmospheric data; also, it is possible to introduce new lepton-flavor changing operators with coefficients small enough to evade present exclusion limits, but large enough to explain the small LSND amplitude [\cite=jm98]. Since a comparison of the theoretical expectations [\cite=flux] with the Super-Kamiokande (SuperK) atmospheric data suggests maximal νμ oscillations with mass-squared difference [formula] eV2 [\cite=SuperK], and in light of the recent data from Super-Kamiokande [\cite=newsolar] favoring vacuum long-wavelength oscillations [\cite=bpw81] [\cite=justso] [\cite=vlw] with δm2sun  ≈  10- 10 eV2 and large mixing as a description of the solar neutrino deficit, it is instructive to determine how maximal or near-maximal solar and atmospheric vacuum oscillations may be accommodated within a three-neutrino universe.

In this letter we use unitarity constraints to derive conditions on the three-neutrino mixing matrix under the assumption that both solar and atmospheric neutrinos undergo maximal mixing in vacuum. By maximal mixing we mean that the disappearance probabilities are equivalent to those for maximal two-neutrino mixing at the relevant mass scales. We find that there exists a unique three-neutrino mixing solution, up to trivial sign ambiguities, which conserves CP and has no oscillations of atmospheric νe, consistent with indications from the Super-Kamiokande experiment [\cite=SuperK]. This mixing matrix predicts that solar νe oscillate maximally into equal numbers of νμ and ντ. We also investigate the consequences for three-neutrino mixing if the solar and atmospheric oscillations are not maximal. We find that for near-maximal solar and atmospheric neutrino mixing the νμ  →  νe and νe  →  ντ oscillation amplitudes for atmospheric and long-baseline experiments are approximately equal, and are limited by the deviation of the solar νe disappearance amplitude from unity. Also, for any non-maximal solar and atmospheric neutrino mixing there must exist νe  →  ντ oscillations that may be visible in future long-baseline experiments.

Oscillation probabilities. We begin our analysis with the survival probability for neutrino oscillations in a vacuum [\cite=VBreal]

[formula]

where [formula] is the probability to find the α-flavor state in the jth mass state (or vice versa), U is the neutrino mixing matrix (in the basis where the charged-lepton mass matrix is diagonal), [formula], [formula], and the sum is over all j and k, subject to k < j. The matrix elements Uαj are the mixings between the flavor (α = e,μ,τ) and the mass (j = 1,2,3) eigenstates. We assume a neutrino mass spectrum with mass eigenvalues m1,m2  ≪  m3, where the solar oscillations are driven by [formula] and the atmospheric oscillations are driven by [formula]. However, only the form of the neutrino mass matrix depends on the mass hierarchy assumption. All of our other conclusions require only the more general assumption that |Δsun|  =  |Δ21|  ≪  |Δ31|≃|Δ32|  =  |Δatm|, which also could apply, e.g., to the case m3  <  m1≃m2, i.e., the solar neutrino vacuum oscillations are driven by a small mass splitting between the two larger masses.

The off-diagonal oscillation probabilites of this model are

[formula]

where the CP-violating "Jarlskog invariant" [\cite=jarlskog] is J  =  Im{Ue2U*e3U*μ2Uμ3}. The CP-odd term changes sign under reversal of the oscillating flavors. The solar amplitudes, quartic in the Uαj's, may themselves be expressed in terms of the Pαj [\cite=kpbook] [\cite=ww98], as may the CP-odd amplitude J [\cite=ww98] [\cite=HnJ].

We note that the CP-violating probability at the atmospheric scale is suppressed to order δm2sun  /  δm2atm, the leading term having canceled in the sum over the two light-mass states. Thus, P(να  →  νβ)  =  P(νβ  →  να) at the atmospheric scale. With MSW-enhanced solutions to the solar deficit, sin 2Δsun is effectively replaced by its average value of zero since Δsun  ≫  1 in this case. Only for the vacuum long-wavelength solution to the solar neutrino anomaly is there hope to measure the CP-odd term.

We will use "amplitude" to denote the coefficients of the oscillating factors. The amplitudes of interest are:

[formula]

In a three-neutrino model

[formula]

The equality in Eq. ([\ref=sunamp]) results from the unitarity condition U*μ1Uμ2 + U*τ1Uτ2  =    -  U*e1Ue2. The inequalities in Eqs. ([\ref=sunamp]), ([\ref=atmue])-([\ref=atmetau]) are obtained by maximizing the amplitude under the unitarity constraints

[formula]

Thus, the amplitudes depend on just three independent Pαj's, and the atmospheric amplitudes depend on just two of the probabilities chosen from Pe3, Pμ3, and Pτ3.

Maximal solar and atmospheric oscillations. We first explore a solution for which both solar νe and atmospheric νμ data can be described by maximal oscillations at the relevant δm2 scales, as suggested by the SuperK data [\cite=newsolar] [\cite=SuperK]. Maximal atmospheric oscillations require [formula]. If solar oscillations are also required to be maximal, then Pe3 = 0 and [formula]. Up to trivial sign changes, unitarity then uniquely specifies the remaining elements of U:

[formula]

With the mixing matrix of Eq. ([\ref=U]), the off-diagonal oscillation probabilities in Eqs. ([\ref=pemu])-([\ref=pmutau]) are given by

[formula]

The zero Ue3 element implies that CP is conserved, J is zero, and the elements of U are real. It also implies that the only oscillations at the Δatm scale are νμ  →  ντ. The solar νe oscillations are 50% into νμ and 50% into ντ, although the oscillation flavors are not distinguishable because they have the same neutral current interactions and there is not enough energy to produce charge current events; however, detection of neutrinos from active galactic nuclei and gamma ray burst sources could distinguish the τ-neutrino flavor from νe and νμ [\cite=halzen]. The mixing matrix for this bi-maximal scenario is similar to that obtained in Refs. [\cite=fritzsch] and [\cite=fukugita], which give maximal solar oscillations ([formula]) and large but not maximal mixing of atmospheric neutrinos ([formula]). All of these scenarios also have Ue3 = 0, which implies maximal solar mixing and only νμ  →  ντ oscillations at the Δatm scale.

A Majorana mass matrix or a hermitian Dirac mass matrix can be diagonalized by a single unitary matrix. For these two cases, we may therefore invert the process to obtain M in the flavor basis from the mass eigenvalues mj and the mixing matrix U. For the Majorana case MMaj = UMdiagUT, while for the hermitian Dirac case MDirac = UMdiagU†. The individual matrix elements are [formula] and [formula], respectively. For real U, as here, there is no difference between these two cases. Reconstruction of the mass matrix from U in Eq. ([\ref=U]) gives

[formula]

in the (νe, νμ, ντ) basis, where the parameters of M are related to the mass eigenvalues as

[formula]

Individual field redefinitions ψα  →    -  ψα and ψj  →    -  ψj allow one to change the signs of individual rows and columns of M. We remind the reader that the form of M derived here applies in the basis where the charged-lepton mass matrix is diagonal.

The two relevant mass-squared differences are

[formula]

The atmospheric oscillation scale requires m  ≈  0.035 eV. The vacuum long-wavelength solar solution then requires |δ  ε|  ≈  10- 8. Both δ and ε must be nonzero to generate a nonzero δm2sun. We reiterate that only the form of the mass matrix in Eq. ([\ref=m]) depends on the assumption m1,m2  ≪  m3; the oscillation probabilites hold for the more general relation |Δsun|  ≪  |Δatm|.

Near-maximal mixing. We next consider having both solar and atmospheric neutrino mixing close to maximal ([formula] and [formula]). Parametrizing the real mixing matrix in terms of Euler angles

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula], the maximal solar and atmospheric mixing of Eq. ([\ref=U]) corresponds to θ1  =  0, [formula], and [formula]. Then for near-maximal mixing we take

[formula]

where the εj are small. The corresponding oscillation amplitudes are

[formula]

Here atmospheric νμ disappearance is determined solely by ε2. The solar νe disappearance and atmospheric and long-baseline νμ  →  νe and νe  →  ντ oscillation amplitudes must satisfy the conditions

[formula]

Hence for near-maximal mixing, νμ  →  νe and νe  →  ντ oscillations in atmospheric and long-baseline experiments are small and approximately equal, and they are constrained by how close the solar mixing is to maximal. The atmospheric νμ disappearance amplitude is independent of the other oscillation amplitudes in this limit.

Non-maximal mixing. We also investigate the more general case of large but non-maximal solar neutrino mixing, which corresponds to nonzero Ue3, and large but non-maximal atmospheric neutrino mixing. A geometric expression for J [\cite=jarlskog] [\cite=ww98] equates its magnitude to the area of a triangle with sides which may be taken to be |Ue3Uμ3|, |Ue2Uμ2|, and |Ue1Uμ1|. Since |Ue3| is known to be small, we use Eq.([\ref=U]) as an approximate guide for U and obtain [formula] as the order of magnitude for the area of the triangle. This bound on |J| is sufficiently small that we will set |J| to zero and continue to work with real U and three independent parameters in the mixing matrix. If the oscillation amplitudes [formula] and [formula] are determined, e.g., from experiment, then there remains only one free parameter, e.g., [formula]. Although pure νμ  ↔  νe oscillations of atmospheric neutrinos are strongly disfavored, modest amounts of νe disappearance have not yet been ruled out. Therefore it is worthwhile to consider the effects of a nonzero Ue3 when the approximations of the previous section are no longer valid.

Given the inputs [formula], [formula], and [formula], the three independent parameters of the matrix U can be determined up to some two-fold ambiguities, only one of which has phenomenological consequences for vacuum oscillations. For example, knowing the atmospheric νμ disappearance amplitude in Eq. ([\ref=atmamp]) determines [formula]:

[formula]

where the -   (+  ) means that νμ is more closely associated with ν2 (ν3). Knowing the atmospheric νe disappearance amplitude in Eq. ([\ref=atmee]) determines [formula]:

[formula]

In Eq. ([\ref=Ue3]) we have chosen the solution which gives [formula] since [formula] implies that the solar νe disappearance amplitude [formula] must be less than [formula], which for the long-wavelength solar solution is disfavored by the data. Then the unitarity relation in Eq. ([\ref=3unitarity]) yields

[formula]

where the ±   in Eq. ([\ref=Utau3]) is correlated with the ∓   in Eq. ([\ref=Umu3]). Also, Eq. ([\ref=sunamp]) and the unitarity relation in Eq. ([\ref=eunitarity]) imply

[formula]

where we have assumed that νe is more closely associated with ν1 than with ν2 (the other possibility, that νe is more closely associated with ν2, has similar vacuum oscillation phenomenology). In principle, there is a constant term in the solar oscillation probability [formula], from averaging of the sin 2Δatm term. However, if [formula] is small, as suggested by the non-observation of νe oscillations in the atmospheric data, this term can be ignored to first approximation [\cite=osland]. The remaining elements of U may also be determined from unitarity (e.g., by using the values of Pμ3, Pe3, Pτ3, Pe1, and Pe2 and the form of Eq. ([\ref=U2]) to determine the three Euler mixing angles).

Once the oscillation parameters are fixed (up to the two-fold ambiguity in Eq. ([\ref=Umu3])), other oscillation amplitudes may be calculated; for example, Eqs. ([\ref=Umu3]) and ([\ref=Ue3]) combined with Eq. ([\ref=atmue]) yield

[formula]

where the ∓   is correlated with the ∓   in Eq. ([\ref=Umu3]). Contours of Aμeatm in the ([formula],[formula]) plane are shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b). Once [formula] and [formula] are measured, the value of Aμeatm is predicted.

In principle the three inputs can be determined by the solar and atmospheric neutrino data. For instance, [formula] is directly determined from vacuum long-wavelength fits to the solar neutrino spectrum. Also, the two independent atmospheric oscillation amplitudes can be found from measurements of

[formula]

and

[formula]

where Noe and Noμ are the expected number of atmospheric e and μ events, [formula], and < S >  is sin 2Δatm averaged over the appropriate atmospheric neutrino spectrum.

The existence of a real solution to Eqs. ([\ref=Ue1]) and ([\ref=Ue2]) requires

[formula]

The limit in Eq. ([\ref=pe3lim]) becomes stringent when [formula] is close to unity. Current data suggest [formula], which gives Pe3  ≤  0.23 and hence [formula]. These limits will improve as more solar and atmospheric data become available. As a check, note that in Eq. ([\ref=pe3lim]) maximal mixing of solar neutrinos ([formula]) automatically leads to |Ue3|  =  Aμeatm  =  Aeτatm  =  0, i.e., all atmospheric oscillations are νμ  →  ντ. From our approximate bound for |J| when Ue3 is small, we obtain [formula], which verifies that CP-violation effects will be small.

Another limit on Pe3 comes from the CHOOZ reactor experiment [\cite=CHOOZ] that measures e disappearance

[formula]

which applies for [formula] eV2. When combined with Eq. ([\ref=Ue3]), Eq. ([\ref=choozlimit]) gives the bound

[formula]

However, for δm2atm  <  10- 3 eV2 there is no limit at all. The proposed experiment to detect reactor anti-neutrinos in the BOREXINO detector [\cite=borexino] can test a value of [formula] as low as 0.4 (corresponding to a limit Pe3  ≤  0.18) for [formula] eV2.

The new physics predicted by the non-maximal mixing model is νe  →  ντ oscillations with leading probability (i.e., ignoring oscillations involving Δsun)

[formula]

which from Eqs. ([\ref=Ue3]), ([\ref=Utau3]), and ([\ref=atmetau]) has an oscillation amplitude

[formula]

where the ±   correlates with the ∓   in Eq. ([\ref=Ue3]). As with Aμeatm, Aeτatm is completely determined once [formula] and [formula] are known, modulo the two-fold ambiguity in Eq. ([\ref=Umu3]). Contours of Aeτatm in the ([formula],[formula]) plane are shown in Figs. 1(c) and 1(d). We note that the approximate equalities involving the atmospheric oscillation amplitudes in Eq. ([\ref=equal]) can also be derived by taking the [formula], [formula] limit in Eqs. ([\ref=amue]) and ([\ref=aetau]).

The νe  →  ντ oscillations could be observed by long-baseline neutrino experiments with proposed high intensity muon sources [\cite=geer] [\cite=bww97] [\cite=bpww], which can also make precise measurements of νμ  →  νe, νμ  →  ντ, and νe  →  νμ oscillations. Sensitivity to [formula] is expected [\cite=geer] for the parameter ranges of interest here. The combination of all measurements (solar, atmospheric, and long-baseline) would serve as a consistency check on the model.

Other consequences. Because the highest mass scale is [formula] eV, there is little neutrino contribution to hot dark matter in this model [\cite=expansion] [\cite=hdm]. Such a mass can be generated for Majorana neutrinos by the see-saw mechanism with a heavy Majorana scale of about [formula] GeV (radiative corrections may reduce this value by about a factor of two [\cite=bludman]) if the Dirac mass is of order the top mass. Also, if m1  ≪  m2  <  m3 in this model, then m2 / m3  ~  10- 4 is approximately equal to (mc / mt)2, as predicted in some see-saw models [\cite=bludman]. The small value of the mass matrix element Mνeνe  ≈  10- 5 eV means that the model has an unmeasurably small contribution to neutrinoless double-beta decay [\cite=KK]. The small values of Ue3 and m3 mean that there are no observable consequences for tritium beta-decay [\cite=tritium]. However, the heaviest mass does provide a relic neutrino target for a mechanism that may generate the cosmic ray air showers observed above [formula] eV [\cite=relic].

Discussion. More precise measurements of the spectrum shape and day-night effects by SuperK and the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) [\cite=SNO] could determine if the solar oscillations are vacuum long-wavelength. Measurements of a seasonal variation of the flux of solar 7Be and pep neutrinos [\cite=seasonal], which can be measured in the BOREXINO experiment [\cite=borexino], would confirm that the solar oscillations are vacuum long-wavelength. The HELLAZ experiment [\cite=HELLAZ] plans to measure the solar pp neutrino spectrum, which would also be useful in establishing the vacuum long-wavelength solution. All of these solar experiments should also be able to pin down the value [formula] in the vacuum long-wavelength scenario.

Further measurements of atmospheric neutrinos will more precisely determine the amplitudes [formula] and [formula], completely fixing (modulo a two-fold ambiguity) all oscillation amplitudes in atmospheric and long-baseline experiments. The MINOS experiment [\cite=MINOS] is expected to test for νμ  →  νe and νμ  →  ντ oscillations for δm2atm  >  10- 3 eV2. Together the solar and atmospheric measurements could put strong limits on Ue3, which governs the amount of νe  →  ντ mixing that could be seen in future long-baseline experiments such as those discussed for the proposed muon collider at Fermilab [\cite=geer]. For near-maximal solar and atmospheric neutrino mixing the νμ  →  νe and νe  →  ντ oscillation amplitudes for atmospheric and long-baseline experiments are approximately equal, and are limited by the deviation of the solar νe disappearance amplitude from unity.
