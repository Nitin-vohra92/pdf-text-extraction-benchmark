SECONDARY REGGEONS IN DIFFRACTIVE DEEP INELASTIC SCATTERING - THE MICROSCOPIC QCD EVALUATION

The secondary Regge trajectories (f,ω,ρ,A2) are well known from the phenomenology of soft hadronic reactions at high energies. For example the cross sections for processes that involve the exchange of non-vacuum quantum numbers are governed by the t-channel reggeon-exchanges and exhibit an energy dependence like [formula], with an almost universal intercept ΔR≃ - 0.5. Hadronic total cross sections are well described by Regge-parametrizations of the form σtot(ab)  =  σ P(s / s0)ε P  +  σR(s / s0)εR with [formula]. Also for the inclusive hadronic reactions there exists a successful Regge-phenomenology [\cite=Triple] [\cite=Kaidalov], which has recently been extended to diffractive DIS[\cite=Triple-prep] [\cite=H1]. For diffraction dissociation of the hadronic projectile ap  →  pX (see fig 1a) the large Regge parameter is [formula]. As can be seen from the diagram in fig.1 there appear the forward scattering amplitudes for a P  →  a P,aR  →  aR, as well as an interference amplitude a P  →  aR. Schematically one can write (we do not show explicitly the reggeon-residue functions and signature factors):

[formula]

In DIS the projectile a is the virtual photon γ* and one readily introduces the pomeron and reggeon structure functions F2 P,R(x,Q2)  =  Q2 / (4π2αem)  ·  σ(γ* P,R) and the interference structure function F2R P(x,Q2)  =  Q2 / (4π2αem)  ·  Σ(γ*R  →  γ* P). For [formula] the secondary trajectories take over, and the effective intercept Δeff, that parametrizes the local [formula] behaviour approaches the pomeron intercept for [formula] and decreases in the region of large [formula] where the secondary exchanges dominate. Such a behaviour has been seen by H1 in diffractive DIS [\cite=H1expo] [\cite=Kolya]. Not much is known in the literature about the importance of the pomeron-reggeon interference term: Triple-Regge fits to hadronic data are not conclusive [\cite=Triple]. If one adopts the naive point of view that one can attribute the hadronic (particle-) state vectors to the pomeron and reggeon one may be mislead to conclude that such interference amplitudes should vanish. For the orthogonality of state vectors 〈R| P〉   =  0 implies vanishing parton number and momentum integrals [\cite=Triple-prep] [\cite=Interference], which suggests a strong suppression of such interference SF's. However we shall demonstrate, that such a reasoning is not born out by pQCD.

The familiar decomposition of structure functions into sea and valence quark contributions F2(x,Q2)  =  Fsea(x,Q2)  +  Fval(x,Q2) serves to identify the Reggeon and Pomeron contributions to the total γ*-absorption cross section (the inclusive SF). At moderately small x the standard fits give [formula] with γ  ~   - 0.45 whereas the sea SF shows a low-x behaviour [formula] with [formula], the intercepts being thus compatible with the hadronic phenomenology. To each pQCD diagram that contributes to the total cross section there is one for the diffractive amplitude as indicated in fig.2.; the building block for the pomeron contribution is the gluon structure function of the target [formula] [\cite=Pomeron]. The analogous quantity for the reggeon contribution is the q annihilation amplitude A(s',k2) as shown in fig.2a). This amplitude has been studied extensively in the literature [\cite=Amplitude]. For the illustrative purposes it is sufficient to know that in the DGLAP approximation A(x,Q2)≃8π2dv(x,Q2) / d ln Q2, where v(x,Q2) is the target's valence quark distribution. One may even go further and use an approximate DGLAP formula for the low [formula]-limit [formula] The final result [\cite=valence] for the diffractive structure function shall then take the symmetric form:

[formula]

where the hardness scale [formula] and for large β one is safe in the pQCD domain [\cite=HT]. Let us discuss the salient features of this equation: first we see now explicitly that there are no extra suppression factors whatsoever for the R P-interference. It enters in the maximal possible way. Second, the β-dependence is a universal (1 - β)2 for the pomeron, reggeon and the interference structure function. In particular, the reggeon structure function differs from the common theoretical guesses F2π  ~  (1 - β) for the pion structure function in the large β region. Third we encountered the manifest leading twist effect. For the longitudinal photons there will emerge the twist four effect in much the same way as it was discussed first by Genovese et al.[\cite=HT] for the pomeron. Fourth our knowledge of the valence and gluon structure functions implies that the result is in the correct order in magnitude with what can be expected from the analysis of the H1 data [\cite=Triple-prep] [\cite=H1].

A final comment on possible applications is in order: the theoretical understanding of the reggeon and inteference contributions has important impact on the theory of the nuclear shadowing of the valence quark densities, a topic which has not been adressed before. Vice versa the phenomenology of nuclear shadowing puts much constraint on the diffractive production mechanisms. For instance we have found that the much discussed hard gluon dominated pomeron favoured by the DGLAP fits to the H1 data yields an unacceptably large shadowing of the deuteron gluon density [\cite=deuteron]. A different option for the pomeron structure function where quarks and gluons share the momentum of the pomeron in about equal fractions, as it emerges from the colour dipole calculations of Nikolaev and Zakharov, (which are incorporated in the above presented evaluations of the pomeron contribution) gives the correct amount of gluon shadowing.
