Introduction

Important information on the physics beyond the Standard Model (SM), such as supersymmetry, left-right symmetric models, multi-Higgs models etc., can be obtained by studying FCNC processes. Among these, ΔF = 2 transitions play a very important role. They have been used in ref. [\cite=susy] [\cite=susybag], for example, to put constraints on the sfermion mass matrix. In this paper we present the results of a lattice calculation of the matrix elements of the most general set of ΔS = 2 dimension-six four-fermion operators, renormalized non-perturbatively in the RI (MOM) scheme [\cite=NP]-[\cite=4ferm_teo]. Our results can be combined with the recent two-loop calculation of the anomalous dimension matrix in the same renormalization scheme [\cite=scimemi] to obtain K0-q0 mixing amplitudes which are consistently computed at the next-to-leading order. A phenomenological application of the results for the matrix elements given below, combined with a complete next-to-leading order (NLO) evolution of the Wilson coefficients, will be presented elsewhere [\cite=inprep].

K0-q0 mixing induces the neutral kaon mass difference ΔMK and is related to the indirect CP violation parameter εK. In the Standard Model, this transition occurs via the dimension-six four-fermion operator OΔS  =  2, with a "left-left" chiral structure. The B-parameter of the matrix element 〈q0|OΔS  =  2|K0〉, commonly known as BK, has been extensively studied on the lattice due to its phenomenological relevance [\cite=sharpe:lat96], and used in many phenomenological studies [\cite=parodi]. For the other operators, instead, all the phenomenological analyses beyond the SM have used B-parameters equal to one, which in some cases, as will be shown below, is a very crude approximation. The present work is the first fully non-perturbative study of the matrix elements of the complete set of ΔS = 2 four-fermion operators. With respect to other calculations, the systematic errors in our results are reduced in two ways: i) by using the tree-level improved Clover action [\cite=sw] and operators [\cite=heat] we obtain matrix elements for which discretization errors are of O(αsa); ii) by renormalizing non-perturbatively the lattice operators, we have eliminated the systematic error due to the bad behaviour of lattice perturbation theory. With the non-perturbative renormalization, the residual error is that due to the truncation of the continuum perturbative series in the evaluation of the Wilson coefficients of the effective Hamiltonian. This error is of O(α2s), where αs is the continuum renormalization constant and could in principle be reduced by the calculation of the N2LO corrections in the continuum. In the RI scheme, for example, this step has recently been done for the calculation of the renormalized quark mass [\cite=fralu].

For the reader who is not interested in technical details, we now give the results for the B-parameters of the relevant operators. The choice of the basis is arbitrary, and different bases can be found in the literature, see for example  [\cite=susy] and [\cite=scimemi]. We have used the SUSY basis which is also the one for which the numerical values of the Wilson coefficients, computed at the NLO, will be given [\cite=inprep], namely

[formula]

where α and β are colour indices. The B-parameters for these operators are defined as

[formula]

where the notation Ôi(μ) (or simply Ôi) denotes the operators renormalized at the scale μ. A few words of explanation are necessary at this point. In eq. ([\ref=eq:bpars]) operators and quark masses are renormalized at the scale μ in the same scheme (e.g. RI, [formula], etc.). The numerical results for the B-parameters, Bi(μ) computed in this paper refer to the RI scheme. Moreover, without loss of generality, we have omitted terms, present in the usual definition of the Bs, which are of higher order in the chiral expansion. Since the definition of the B-parameters is conventional, we prefer to use those in eq. ([\ref=eq:bpars]) for which, as explained in sec. [\ref=sec:res], the scaling properties are the simplest ones.

Our best estimates of the B-parameters, for a renormalization scale of μ = 2 GeV are

[formula]

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: in sec. [\ref=sec:npm], we address the problem of operator mixing and renormalization and give a brief account of the non-perturbative method (NPM) used in the computation of the operator renormalization constants; in sec. [\ref=sec:res], we discuss the definition of the B-parameters and describe their extraction from the lattice correlation functions; in sec. [\ref=sec:numres], we present our results for the full operator basis, at β = 6.0 and 6.2 and for different renormalization scales; a discussion of the errors assigned to the final results in eq. ([\ref=eq:fres]) can also be found in this section; finally, in sec. [\ref=sec:concl], we present our conclusions.

Non-Perturbative renormalization

In this section, we briefly recall the reasons for which the non-perturbative renormalization of the lattice operators is important and describe the procedure which has been used to obtain, for the cases of interest, finite matrix elements from the bare lattice operators.

The Wilson lattice regularization breaks chiral symmetry. This implies that each operator in the ΔS  =  2 Hamiltonian mixes with operators belonging to different chiral representations [\cite=MARTIW] [\cite=octet]. Because of the mixing induced by the lattice, the correct chiral behaviour of the operators is achieved with Wilson fermions only in the continuum limit. This represented a long-standing problem in the evaluation of BK [\cite=BERNARD2] [\cite=GAVELA] , only recently solved with the introduction of Non-Perturbative Renormalization methods. In these approaches the renormalization constants (mixing matrix) are computed non-perturbatively on the lattice either by projecting on external quark and gluon states (NPM) as proposed in ref. [\cite=NP] or, in the spirit of ref. [\cite=octet], by using chiral Ward Identities [\cite=WI] [\cite=JAPBK]. Recent studies of the B-parameters, with both non-perturbative renormalization methods, [\cite=DS=2]-[\cite=contil] and [\cite=JAPBK], show that discretization effects are less important than those due to the perturbative evaluation of the mixing coefficients.

Given the success of the non-perturbative methods in the computation of BK, the NPM has been applied to the evaluation of the two ΔI = 3 / 2 B-parameters of the electro-penguin operators, B3 / 27 and B3 / 28 (these B-parameters coincide with those of the operators O4 nd O5 respectively). Also in this case, as shown in ref. [\cite=contil], it has been found that the non-perturbative renormalization of the lattice operators gives B-parameters that significantly differ from those renormalized perturbatively [\cite=contil] [\cite=gupta_bp].

An extensive study of the renormalization properties of the four-fermion operators can be found in [\cite=4ferm_teo]. There we detail the issues of relevance to the non-perturbative renormalization of all the ΔS  =  2 operators. We have used these results in the present study.

The NPM for the evaluation of the renormalization constants of lattice operators consists in imposing suitable renormalization conditions on lattice amputated quark correlation functions [\cite=NP]. In our case, we compute four-fermion Green functions in the Landau gauge. All external quark lines are at equal momentum p. After amputating and projecting these correlation functions (see refs. [\cite=DS=2] and [\cite=4ferm_teo] for details), the renormalization conditions are imposed in the deep Euclidean region at the scale p2  =  μ2. This renormalization scheme has been recently called the Regularization Independent (RI) scheme [\cite=Ciuchini2] (MOM in the early literature) in order to emphasize that the renormalization conditions are independent of the regularization scheme, although they depend on the external states used in the renormalization procedure (and on the gauge). Thus, at fixed cutoff (i.e. fixed β), we compute non-perturbatively the renormalization constants and the renormalized operator ÔRI(μ) in the RI scheme. In order to obtain the physical amplitudes, which are renormalization group invariant and scheme independent, the renormalized matrix elements must subsequently be combined with the corresponding Wilson coefficients of the effective Hamiltonian. For the operators of interest, the latter are known at the NLO in continuum perturbation theory [\cite=scimemi].

In [\cite=4ferm_teo], we have determined non-perturbatively the operator mixing for the complete basis of four-fermion operators, with the aid of the discrete symmetries (parity, charge conjugation and switching of flavours), in the spirit of ref. [\cite=BERNARD2]. The renormalization of the parity-even operators, relevant to this work, is more conveniently expressed in terms of the following basis of five operators:

[formula]

The operators [formula] form a complete basis on the lattice. In these expressions, Γ  ×  Γ (with Γ  =  V,A,S,P,T a generic Dirac matrix) stands for [formula], where [formula] are fermion fields with flavours chosen so as to reproduce the desired operators (see ref. [\cite=4ferm_teo] for details).

The parity-even parts of the five SUSY operators defined in eq. ([\ref=eq:ods2]), which are the relevant ones for K0-q0 mixing, are related to the operators of eq. ([\ref=base]) in the following way:

[formula]

On the lattice, Q1 mixes under renormalization with the other four operators as follows

[formula]

where Z11 is a multiplicative logarithmically divergent renormalization constant; it depends on the coupling and aμ. The mixing coefficients Z1i (with [formula]) are finite; they only depend on the lattice coupling g20(a).

The other renormalized operators are defined as follows:

[formula]

where the Zijs are logarithmically divergent renormalization constants which depend on the coupling and aμ. The above mixing matrices are not peculiar to the lattice regularization, but also occur in the continuum. The breaking of chiral symmetry by the Wilson action requires the additional subtractions:

[formula]

where the Zsijs are finite coefficients which only depend on g20(a).

The results for all the renormalization constants Zij and Zsij (computed with the NPM, for several renormalization scales μ, at β  =  6.0 and 6.2) can be found in [\cite=4ferm_teo].

B-parameters

In this section we discuss the definition of the B-parameters and their dependence on the renormalization scale. We also sketch the extraction of these quantities from lattice correlation functions.

The B-parameters are usually defined as

[formula]

where the operator matrix elements in the Vacuum Saturation Approximation (VSA) are given by

[formula]

Âμ and P̂ are the renormalized axial current and pseudoscalar densities, Âμ  =  ZAAμ and P̂  =  ZPP, with ZA the (finite) renormalization constant of the lattice axial current, Aμ  =  s̄γμγ5d, and ZP the renormalization constant of the lattice pseudoscalar density, P = s̄γ5d. For simplicity, P̂ is renormalized at the same scale μ, and in the same renormalization scheme as the four-fermion operators (the RI scheme in our case). Using the relations

[formula]

where the second equality is a consequence of the Ward identity for the axial current (with ms(μ) and md(μ) renormalized in the same scheme and at the same scale as P̂), we find, with Nc = 3

[formula]

The VSA values of the matrix elements of Ô4 and Ô5 in eq. ([\ref=eq:vsaa]) differ from the factors appearing in the definition of the B-parameters in eq. ([\ref=eq:bpars]) by the terms proportional to 1 / 6 and 3 / 2 respectively. These terms, which originate from the squared matrix elements of the axial current in eq. ([\ref=eq:ds2vsa]), are of higher order in the chiral expansion and have been dropped in our definition of the B-parameters. This implies that, out of the chiral limit, the values of B4 and B5 with our definition differ from those obtained by using eq. ([\ref=eq:vsaa]). To illustrate this point, let us imagine that as ms  →    ∞  , for some value of the renormalization scale μ̄, the values of the matrix elements of Ô4 and Ô5 were exactly those of the VSA. Under these hypotheses, using eq. ([\ref=eq:bpars]), we would get B4(μ̄) = 7 / 6 and B5(μ̄) = 5 / 2 instead of one.

We now explain why we prefer the definition of the B-parameters given in eq. ([\ref=eq:bpars]) rather than the standard definition obtained from eq. ([\ref=eq:vsaa]). Neglecting discretization errors, the B-parameters of the operators Ô2-Ô5 defined in eq. ([\ref=eq:bpars]) obey the renormalization group equation

[formula]

where μd / dμ  =  μ∂  /  ∂μ  +  β(αs)∂  /  ∂αs, and γOi (γOiOj) and γP are the anomalous dimension (matrix) of the operator Ôi(μ) and of the scalar density respectively . The physical amplitude is given by

[formula]

where, in the last expression, we have only shown the leading behaviour of the different factors which depend on μ, namely the Wilson coefficient, the B-parameter and the quark masses. Eq. ([\ref=eq:schema]) shows explicitly the cancellation of the μ-dependent terms in the amplitude: the quark masses scale with an anomalous dimension which is opposite in sign to that of the pseudoscalar density (since m(μ)P̂(μ) is renormalization group invariant) so that Bi(μ)  /  m2(μ) scales as the corresponding operator Ôi(μ); the μ-dependence of the latter is then cancelled by that of the corresponding Wilson coefficient. This remains true at all order in αs. Out of the chiral limit, with the standard definition of the B-parameters obtained by using the VSA matrix elements of eq. ([\ref=eq:vsaa]), the scaling properties of B4(μ) and B5(μ) would have been much more complicated. The reason is that, in these cases, the two contributions on the right hand side have a piece which scales as the squared pseudoscalar density and another (proportional to the physical quantity |〈q0|Âμ|0〉|2) which is renormalization group invariant. The μ-independence of the final result would then have been recovered then in a very intricate way. Since the definition of the B-parameters is conventional, we prefer to use that of eq. ([\ref=eq:bpars]), for which the scaling properties of all the B-parameters are the simplest ones. Moreover, with this choice, they are the same as those derived in the chiral limit.

In order to extract the B-parameters, we need to compute the following two- and three-point correlation functions:

[formula]

where [formula] and Ô stands for any renormalized four-fermion operator of interest. All correlation functions have been evaluated with degenerate quark masses. By forming suitable ratios of the above correlations, and looking at their asymptotic behaviour at large time separations, we can isolate the desired matrix elements

[formula]

We stress that the B-parameters extracted from R1,R4 and R5 are identical to the B-parameters for the operators OΔS  =  2,O3 / 28 and O3 / 27 respectively. In ref. [\cite=contil], the results referred to the operators OΔS  =  2,O3 / 28 and O3 / 27 at β = 6.0 only. In this paper, we present the results for all the B-parameters and for β = 6.0 and 6.2.

Numerical results

Our simulations have been performed at β  =  6.0 and 6.2 with the tree-level Clover action, for several values of the quark masses (corresponding to the values of the hopping parameter k given in table [\ref=tab:runs]), in the quenched approximation. The physical volume is approximatively the same on the two lattices. A summary of the main parameters is given in the same table. "Time Intervals" denote the range in time (in lattice units) on which the two-point correlation functions have been fitted to extract the meson masses and the matrix elements of Aμ and P. The ratios Ri, related to the matrix elements of the four-fermion operators, have been extracted on the same time intervals. Statistical errors have been estimated with the jacknife method, by decimating 10 configurations at a time.

As discussed in sec. [\ref=sec:npm], the renormalization constants have been obtained from the quark correlation functions, in the Landau gauge. The results for the Zs have been obtained on a 163  ×  32 (163  ×  32) lattice at β = 6.0 (6.2), using a statistical sample of 100 (180) configurations. In constructing the renormalized operators we have used the central values of the renormalization constants neglecting their statistical errors. For this reason the errors on the B-parameters only include those of operator matrix elements. In the ratios ([\ref=eq:rapporti]), we also need the axial-current renormalization constant ZA and the μ-dependent renormalization constant ZP of the pseudoscalar density. Although ZA should not depend on aμ, slight variations of its NPM estimate, arising from systematic effects, partially cancel analogous variations of R1, giving more stable results in the extraction of the matrix elements. The NPM estimates for ZP and ZA used in the present work are those of ref. [\cite=ggrt].

In order to extract the B-parameters from the ratios of eqs. ([\ref=eq:rapporti]), we follow the procedure of ref. [\cite=B_K], by fitting the Ri linearly in X and Y (i.e. linearly in m2K and (p  ·  q) ) with the function

[formula]

where

[formula]

with

[formula]

Assuming α1 and β1 to be zero, B1 is given by:

[formula]

Since we are working in the linear approximation in X and Y, there is no difference between the value obtained in the chiral limit and at the physical kaon mass. In the chiral limit, the B-parameters for the other four operators are given by

[formula]

We stress again that B4  =  B3 / 28 and B5  =  B3 / 27. At the physical kaon mass we have instead

[formula]

where Xs is obtained by extrapolating linearly X as a function of the squared pseudoscalar meson mass to the physical value mexpK.

In tables [\ref=tab:60] and [\ref=tab:62] we give the values of the B-parameters in the chiral limit, extracted using eqs. ([\ref=eq:b1]) and ([\ref=eq:bc]), at β = 6.0 and 6.2 respectively; in tables [\ref=tab:60p] and [\ref=tab:62p] the B-parameters are evaluated at the physical kaon mass using eq. ([\ref=eq:bp]) for i = 2,3,4,5. At β = 6.0, the results for B1, B4 and B5 extrapolated to the chiral limit are slightly different from those of ref. [\cite=contil]. There are several reasons for the differences: i) in order to fix the scale and the strange quark mass we have used the lattice-plane method of ref. [\cite=giusti]; ii) in the present analysis, we use the "lattice dispersion relation" of eq. ([\ref=fit_var2]), instead than the continuum one [formula] which was adopted in our previous study ; iii) in order to reduce the systematic effects due to higher order terms in the chiral expansion, i.e. to higher powers of p  ·  q, we have not used the results corresponding to [formula] and [formula]. This choice stabilizes the results for B1 between β = 6.0 and β = 6.2 whilst the results for the other B-parameters remain essentially unchanged.

We now describe the criteria followed in order to obtain our best estimates of the B-parameters. Although we have data at two different values of the lattice spacing, the statistical errors, and the uncertainties in the extraction of the matrix elements, are too large to enable any extrapolation to the continuum limit a  →  0 : within the precision of our results we cannot detect the dependence of B-parameters on a. For this reason, we estimate the central values by averaging the B-parameters obtained with the physical mass mexpK at the two values of β. Since the results at β = 6.0 have smaller statistical errors but suffer from larger discretization effects, we do not weight the averages with the quoted statistical errors but take simply the sum of the two values divided by two. As far as the errors are concerned we take the largest of the two statistical errors. This is a rather conservative way of estimating the errors. In order to compare the results of Run A and Run B, we must choose the same physical renormalization scale μ. Using the estimates of the lattice spacing given in table [\ref=tab:runs], we have taken μ2a2 = 0.96 and μ2a2 = 0.62, corresponding to μ = 2.08 GeV and μ = 2.12 GeV, at β = 6.0 and 6.2 respectively. We quote the results as obtained at μ = 2 GeV, since the running of the matrix elements between μ  ~  2.1 and 2.0 is totally negligible in comparison with the final errors. In table [\ref=tab:summary], we summarize the values which have been used to give the final estimates. The columns denoted by mexpK have been used to get the final results in eq. ([\ref=eq:fres]).

In ref. [\cite=gupta_bp] B2 and B3 have been obtained at β  =  6.0 with the Wilson action and the operators renormalized perturbatively in the [formula] scheme; the result is

[formula]

Although a direct comparison is not possible (our results are in the RI scheme), to the extent that the matching coefficients between the two schemes are a small effect [\cite=contil], comparison of eqs.([\ref=eq:fres]) and ([\ref=eq:Bpt]) suggests that perturbative renormalization gives significantly different results in some cases. This confirms the need for non perturbative renormalization.

Conclusions

In this paper we have presented a lattice calculation of the matrix elements of the most general set of ΔS = 2 dimension-six four-fermion operators, renormalized non-perturbatively in the RI (MOM) scheme [\cite=NP]-[\cite=4ferm_teo]. The calculations have been performed at two different values of the lattice spacing a. Although our precision is not sufficient to make an extrapolation to the continuum limit, the comparison between the results on two different lattices allows a better estimate of the final errors. The main results for the five B-parameters are summarized in tab. [\ref=tab:summary]. From this table, we have extracted our best estimates which are given in eq. ([\ref=eq:fres]). We observe that the lattice values of B3,4 are close to their VSA whereas this is not true for B1,2,5. Our results allow an improvement in the accuracy of phenomenological analyses intended to put bounds on basic parameters of theories beyond the Standard Model.
