The Reznichenko property and the Pytkeev property in hyperspaces

Introduction

Let X be a space (we suppose that all spaces are Hausdorff). For a subset A of X and a family A of subsets of X we put [formula] and Ac  =  {Ac:A∈A}. By 2X we denote the family of all closed subsets of X. If A is a subset of X, then we write

[formula], A+  =  {F∈2X:F  ⊂  A}.

There are many known topologies on 2X. The most popular among them is the Vietoris topology [formula], where the lower Vietoris topology [formula] is generated by all sets A-, A  ⊂  X open, and the upper Vietoris topology [formula] is generated by sets B+, B open in X.

Let Δ be a subset of 2X. Then the upper Δ-topology, denoted by Δ+ (and first studied in abstract in [\cite=poppe] and then in [\cite=dimaiohola]), is the topology whose subbase is the collection

[formula]

We consider only such subsets Δ of 2X which are closed for finite unions and contain all singletons. In that case the above collection is a base for Δ+ because we have

[formula]

Two important special cases, in which we are especially interested in this paper, are [formula] - the family of all finite subsets of X, and [formula] - the collection of compact subsets of X. The [formula]-topology will be denoted by [formula] and the [formula]-topology by [formula]. The [formula]-topology is known as the upper Fell topology (or the co-compact topology) [\cite=fell]. The Fell topology [formula] on 2X is the topology [formula].

We investigate two closure type properties of 2X, the Reznichenko property and the Pytkeev property, which are intermediate between sequentiality and the countable tightness property that have been studied in [\cite=chv] and [\cite=hou].

Let us fix some terminology and notation that we need.

Let A and B be sets whose members are families of subsets of an infinite set X. Then (see [\cite=coc1], [\cite=coc2]):

[formula] denotes the selection principle:

For each sequence [formula] of elements of A there is a sequence [formula] such that for each n bn∈An, and [formula] is an element of B.

[formula] denotes the selection hypothesis:

For each sequence [formula] of elements of A there is a sequence [formula] of finite sets such that for each n Bn  ⊂  An, and [formula] is an element of B.

If C is a family of subsets of a space X then an open cover U of X is called a C-cover if each C∈C is contained in an element of U. [formula]-covers and [formula]-covers are customarily called ω-covers and k-covers, respectively. We suppose that C-covers we consider are non-trivial, i.e. that X does not belong to the cover.

For a topological space X and a point x∈X we denote:

OC - the family of (open) C-covers of X.

Ω - the family of ω-covers of X.

K - the family of k-covers of X.

[formula].

We also need the notion of groupability (see [\cite=coc7]).

A countable C-cover U of a space X is groupable if there is a partition [formula] of U into pairwise disjoint finite sets such that for each C∈C, for all but finitely many n there is a U∈Un such that C  ⊂  U. A countable set A∈Ωx is groupable if there is a partition [formula] of A into finite sets such that each neighborhood of x has nonempty intersection with all but finitely many Bn.

Let us denote:

OCgp - the family of groupable C-covers of X.

Ωgp - the family of groupable ω-covers of X.

Kgp - the family of groupable k-covers of X.

Ωgpx - the family of groupable elements of Ωx.

Let us mention that considering the space 2X, Δ  ⊂  2X and S∈2X we shall use the symbol Δ+S to denote ΩS with respect to Δ+-topology on 2X. We use ΩS and KS studying the [formula]- and [formula]-topology on 2X. Similarly for (Δ+S)gp ΩgpS and KgpS.

The Reznichenko property

In 1996, Reznichenko introduced (in a seminar at Moscow State University) the following property for a space X: For each A  ⊂  X and each [formula] there is a countable infinite family A of finite pairwise disjoint subsets of A such that each neighborhood of x meets all but finitely many elements of A. It is the same as to say that each countable element of Ωx is a member of Ωgpx. This property was studied further in [\cite=malyhintironi] (under the name weakly Fréchet-Urysohn), [\cite=fedeliledonne]. In [\cite=ks] and [\cite=coc7] this property was called the Reznichenko property and function spaces [formula] having this property were studied (see also [\cite=sakai2]). In [\cite=agt] this property was considered in function spaces [formula].

Evidently, if a space X has the Reznichenko property then it has countable tightness.

Here we investigate the Reznichenko property in hyperspaces.

For a space X and a family Δ  ⊂  2X (closed for finite unions and containing all singletons) the following statements are equivalent:

(2X,Δ+) has the Reznichenko property;

For each open set Y  ⊂  X and each open Δ-cover U of Y there is a sequence [formula] of finite pairwise disjoint subsets of U such that each D∈Δ belongs to some U∈Un for all but finitely many n.

(1)  ⇒  (2): Let Y be an open subset of X and let U be an open Δ-cover of Y. Then A: = Uc is a subset of 2X and Yc∈ClΔ+(A). Indeed, let D∈Δ be a subset of Y. There is a U∈U such that D  ⊂  U  ⊂  Y and thus Yc  ⊂  Uc  ⊂  Dc, i.e. Uc∈(Dc)+ and Yc∈(Dc)+. So, [formula], that is Yc∈ClΔ+(A). Apply (1) to find a sequence [formula] of finite pairwise disjoint subsets of A such that each Δ+-neighborhood of Yc intersects An for all but finitely many n. For each n let Un  =  Acn. The sets Un  ⊂  U are pairwise disjoint (because An's are) and witness for U that Y satisfies (2). Let D  ⊂  Y be an element from Δ. Then (Dc)+ is a Δ+-neighborhood of Yc, so that there is n0 such that [formula] for each n > n0. So, for each n > n0 there exists a set An∈An with An  ⊂  Dc, i.e. D  ⊂  Acn∈Un. This means that (2) holds.

(2)  ⇒  (1): Let A be a subset of 2X and S∈2X a point such that [formula]. Then U: = Ac is a (non-trivial) Δ-cover of the open set Sc  ⊂  X. Apply (2) to Sc and U. One can choose a sequence [formula] of finite pairwise disjoint subsets of U such that for each D  ⊂  Y belonging to Δ for all but finitely many n there is a V∈Vn with D  ⊂  V. Let for each n, Bn  =  Vcn. Then the collection [formula] witnesses (1). Let (Dc)+ be a Δ+-neighborhood of S. Then S  ⊂  Dc implies D  ⊂  Sc so that there is [formula] such that for all n > m there exists a member Bn∈Bn with D  ⊂  Bn, and consequently Bcn∈(Dc)+. This shows that [formula] for all but finitely many n and completes the proof of the theorem. [formula]

In fact, we shall prove a general result regarding the Reznichenko property in hyperspaces.

Let X be a space and let Δ and Σ be subsets of 2X closed for finite unions and containing all singletons. Then the following statements are equivalent:

2X satisfies [formula] for each A∈2X;

Each open set Y  ⊂  X satisfies [formula].

(1)  ⇒  (2): Let [formula] be a sequence of Δ-covers of Y. Then [formula] is a sequence of subsets of 2X and Yc∈ClΔ+(Ucn) for each [formula]. Applying (1) we find a sequence [formula] such that for each n Un∈Un and [formula]. There is a partition [formula] of F such that each Σ+-neighborhood of Yc meets all but finitely many sets Fn. For each n let Vn  =  Fcn. The sets Vn are pairwise disjoint, finite subsets of [formula] and show that this set is a groupable Σ-cover of Y. Let S  ⊂  Y be a member of Σ. Then (Sc)+ is a Σ+-neighborhood of Yc, so that there is n0 such that [formula] for each n > n0. So, for each n > n0 there exists a set Fn∈Fn which is a subset of Sc, i.e. S  ⊂  Fcn∈Vn. This means that [formula] is a groupable Σ-cover of Y, hence (2) holds.

(2)  ⇒  (1): Let [formula] be a sequence of subsets of 2X such that a point E∈2X belongs to [formula] for each n. For each n put Un  =  Acn. Apply (2) to the open set Ec and the sequence [formula] of Δ-covers of Ec. We choose a sequence (Un:n∈Un) such that for each n Un∈Un and [formula] is a groupable Σ-cover of Ec. Suppose that the partition [formula] witnesses groupability of G. Let for each n, An = Ucn∈An and Bn  =  Gcn. Then the collection [formula] witnesses that [formula] a groupable element of Σ+E. Indeed, let (Sc)+ be a Σ+-neighborhood of E. Then E  ⊂  Sc implies S  ⊂  Ec so that there is k such that for all n > k there exists a member Gn∈Gn with S  ⊂  Gn, and consequently Gcn∈(Sc)+. This shows that [formula] for all but finitely many n. [formula]

The condition (2) in this theorem can be called the (Δ+,Σ+)-selectively Reznichenko property (of 2X).

Let us recall that a space X is said to have countable strong fan tightness [\cite=sakai1] if for each sequence [formula] of subsets of X and each [formula] there is a sequence [formula] such that for each n xn∈An and [formula], i.e. if for each x∈X the selection hypothesis [formula] is satisfied.

It was shown in [\cite=dimkocmec] that [formula] (resp. [formula]) has countable strong fan tightness if and only if each open set Y  ⊂  X satisfies [formula] (resp. [formula]).

According to [\cite=coc7] a space X satisfies [formula] if and only if all finite powers of X have the Gerlits-Nagy property [\cite=gerlitsnagy] (equivalently, the Hurewicz property as well as the Rothberger property). Recall that X has the Rothberger property [\cite=rothberger38] if it satisfies [formula], where O is the family of open covers of X. X has the Hurewicz property [\cite=hurewicz] if for each sequence [formula] of open covers of X there is a sequence [formula] such that for each n   Vn is a finite subset of Un and each x∈X belongs to [formula] for all but finitely many n.

Letting in Theorem [\ref=rezgeneral1] [formula] (resp. [formula]) we obtain the following two important corollaries.

For a space X the following statements are equivalent:

[formula] has the Reznichenko property and countable strong fan tightness;

If Y is an open subset of X, then all finite powers of Y have the Gerlits-Nagy property.

For a space X the following are equivalent:

[formula] has the Reznichenko property and countable strong fan tightness;

Each open set Y  ⊂  X satisfies [formula].

Similarly to the proof of Theorem [\ref=rezgeneral1] we can prove

Let X be a space and let Δ and Σ be subsets of 2X closed for finite unions and containing all singletons. Then the following statements are equivalent:

2X satisfies [formula] for each A∈2X;

Each open set Y  ⊂  X satisfies [formula].

A space X is said to have countable fan tightness [\cite=arh1], [\cite=arhbook] if for each x∈X it satisfies [formula], i.e. if whenever [formula] is a sequence of subsets of X and [formula] there are finite sets Bn  ⊂  An, [formula], such that [formula].

In [\cite=dimkocmec] it was proved that [formula] (resp. [formula]) has countable fan tightness if and only if each open set Y  ⊂  X satisfies [formula] (resp. [formula]. A result in [\cite=coc7] states that all finite powers of of a space X have the Hurewicz property if and only if X belongs to the class [formula].

As the corollaries of Theorem [\ref=rezgeneralfin] we have:

For a space X the following statements are equivalent:

[formula] has both the Reznichenko property and countable fan tightness;

If Y is an open subset of X, then each finite power of Y has the Hurewicz property.

For a space X the following are equivalent:

[formula] has the Reznichenko property and countable fan tightness;

Each open set Y  ⊂  X satisfies [formula].

The Pytkeev property

A space X has the Pytkeev property if for each A  ⊂  X and each [formula] there is a countable collection [formula] of (countable) infinite subsets of A which is a π-network at x, i.e. each neighborhood of x contains some An. This property was introduced in [\cite=pytkeev] and then studied in [\cite=malyhintironi] (where the name Pytkeev space was used) and [\cite=fedeliledonne]. Pytkeev's property in function spaces [formula] was studied in [\cite=sakai2].

Every (sub)sequential space has the Pytkeev property [\cite=pytkeev] and every Pytkeev space has the Reznichenko property [\cite=malyhintironi].

In this section we consider the Pytkeev property in hyperspaces with Δ+-topologies. We begin by the following general result.

If X is a space and Δ and Σ subsets of 2X containing all singletons and closed for finite unions, then the following are equivalent:

2X has the (Δ+,Σ+)-Pytkeev property, i.e. for each A  ⊂  2X and each [formula] there is a family [formula] of countable infinite subsets of A which is a π-network at S with respect to the Σ+-topology.

For each open set Y  ⊂  X and each Δ-cover U of Y there is a sequence [formula] of infinite subsets of U such that [formula] is a (not necessarily open) Σ-cover of Y.

(1)  ⇒  (2): Let U be a Δ-cover of Y. Then A: = {Uc:U∈U} is a subset of 2X and Yc∈ClΔ+(A). Apply (1) to find a sequence [formula] of countable infinite subsets of A such that the set [formula] ia a Σ+-π-network at Yc. For each n denote by Un the subset {U:Uc∈Bn} of U. We claim that [formula] is a Σ-cover of Y. For any S  ⊂  Y with S∈Σ, the set (Sc)+ is a Σ+-neighborhood of Yc and therefore there is [formula] such that Bm  ⊂  (Sc)+. Therefore, for each Uc∈Bm we have Uc  ⊂  Sc, i.e. [formula]. This means that the collection [formula] is indeed a Σ-cover of Y.

(2)  ⇒  (1): Let A be a subset of 2X and let [formula]. Then Sc is an open subset of X and the family [formula] is an open Δ-cover of Sc. Apply (2) to the set Sc and its Δ-cover U and choose infinite sets Un  ⊂  U, [formula], such that the family [formula] is a Σ-cover of Sc. Put for each n

[formula]

Then each An is an infinite subset of A. We prove that the collection [formula] is a π-network at S∈(2X,Σ+).

Let (Ec)+, E  ⊂  X and E∈Σ, be a Σ+-neighborhood of S. Then S  ⊂  Ec implies E  ⊂  Sc so that there is some [formula] with [formula]. Further we have Ai  ⊂  (Ec)+, i.e. (1) holds. [formula]

As consequences of this theorem we obtain the following two results.

For a space X the following statements are equivalent:

[formula] has the Pytkeev property;

For each open set Y  ⊂  X and each ω-cover U of Y there is a sequence [formula] of infinite countable subsets of U such that [formula] is an (not necessarily open) ω-cover of Y.

For a space X the following statements are equivalent:

[formula] has the Pytkeev property;

For each open set Y  ⊂  X and each k-cover U of Y there is a sequence [formula] of countable infinite subsets of U such that [formula] is a (not necessarily open) k-cover of Y.

If [formula] has the Pytkeev property, is [formula] sequential? What about [formula]?

Remark A It is known that the space [formula] is compact with no assumptions on X and that a Hausdorff space X is locally compact if and only if [formula] is Hausdorff. According to a result from [\cite=malyhintironi], each compact Hausdorff space of countable tightness is a Pytkeev space. On the other hand, in [\cite=hou] (see also [\cite=chv]) it was shown that for a locally compact Hausdorff space X the tightness of [formula] is countable if and only if X is hereditarily separable and hereditarily Lindelöf. So we have:

For a locally compact Hausdorff space X the following assertions are equivalent:

[formula] has countable tightness;

[formula] has the Reznichenko property;

[formula] has the Pytkeev property;

X is both hereditarily separable and hereditarily Lindelöf.

Remark B According to results from [\cite=balogh] and [\cite=dow] one can suppose that in some models of [formula] (in which each compact Hausdorff space of countable tightness is sequential) we have: For a locally compact Hausdorff space X each of the conditions (a)-(d) in the previous theorem is equivalent to the assertion [formula] is a sequential space.

Remark C Let us consider a selective version of the Pytkeev property. Call a space X selectively Pytkeev if for each sequence [formula] of subsets of X and each point [formula] there is an infinite family [formula] of countable infinite sets which is a π-network at x and such that for each n Bn  ⊂  An. Then one can prove the statements similar to those in Theorem [\ref=pytkeevgeneral] and Corollaries [\ref=pytkeevzet] and [\ref=pytkeevfell].
