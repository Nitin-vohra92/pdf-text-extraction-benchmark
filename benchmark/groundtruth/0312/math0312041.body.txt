A short constructive proof of Jordan's decomposition theorem Pawel Kröger

Theorem. Let A be a linear operator on a finite dimensional complex vector space X. There exist complex numbers λi and a base [formula] of X where 1  ≤  i  ≤  n and 0  ≤  j  ≤  ki such that

[formula]

A second linear operator B on X is similar to A if and only if dim (B - λ)kX =  dim (A - λ)kX for every eigenvalue λ and every [formula]. Proof. We prove the first part of the theorem by induction with respect to the number of distinct eigenvalues of A. If there are no eigenvalues, then the dimension of X is 0 and the theorem is trivial. Assume that the assertion is true for every linear transformation with d distinct eigenvalues. Consider a linear transformation A with d + 1 distinct eigenvalues. Let λ be one of them. Set Rk = (A - λ)kX for [formula]. There exists a positive integer a such that Ra is a proper subspace of Ra - 1 and such that Ra + 1 = Ra. Thus, the restriction of A - λ to Ra is invertible. The restriction of A to Ra has only d distinct eigenvalues and the induction assumption applies. There is a base [formula] of Ra where 1  ≤  i  ≤  n and 0  ≤  j  ≤  ki that satisfies (1). We need to extend that base to a base of X.

The intersection of Ra and the kernel of (A - λ)a is [formula]. Let rk be the dimension of Rk for every k. Let Nk be the kernel of the restriction of A - λ to Rk for every k. Set nk  =   dim Nk. Thus, nk  ≥  nk + 1 for every k. By the theorem on the dimensions of range and kernel of a linear transformation, dim Nk = rk - rk + 1.

For every k with nk > nk + 1 we will construct nk - nk + 1 chains of length k + 1 with the chain property (1) for the eigenvalue λ. We choose inductively a base [formula] of Nk for every [formula]; here n < i  ≤  n + nk. For k  ≥  a we have [formula], and our base is empty. Assume that we have chosen a base of Nk for some k with 1  ≤  k  ≤  a. We add nk - 1 - nk vectors [formula] for n + nk < i  ≤  n + nk - 1 in order to obtain a base of Nk - 1.

Now recall that Nk  ⊂  Rk for every k. Choose [formula] with [formula] for n + nk + 1 < i  ≤  n + nk and set [formula] for 1  ≤  j  ≤  k - 1. Thus, [formula] for every i,j with i > n. We obtain a total of

[formula]

vectors from the kernel of (A - λ)a. It remains to show that those vectors are linear independent. We set ki = k for n + nk + 1 < i  ≤  n + nk and k < a. Assume that there are complex numbers cji such that

[formula]

We prove by induction on j that cji = 0 for every i > n and every j. Recall that ki < a for every i > n. Assume that cji = 0 for every j with j > k and some k  ≤  a - 1. We apply (A - λ)k to the above equation and obtain that

[formula]

Thus, cki = 0 for n < i  ≤  n + nk (recall that the vectors [formula] for n < i  ≤  n + nk are linear independent).

The second part of the theorem is an obvious consequence of the above construction. Acknowledgement. The author is very grateful to Professor Rainer Schimming and to Professor Mark Ashbaugh for bringing the references
