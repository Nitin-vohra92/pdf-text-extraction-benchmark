A Bilateral Version of the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem

Introduction

The Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem [\cite=brei57], [\cite=pete83] is used in many problems related to the metric entropy map of an ergodic measure. We extend this well-known result to the case of a bijective dynamical system. Our proof follows the line of Petersen's proof [\cite=pete83]. We illustrate this new result with an example that gives an inequality between shifts and cellular automata entropies and some analog of the Lyapunov exponents. Our bilateral version of the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem is expected to be useful in other areas of dynamical systems.

Background material

Let X be a compact space, μ a probability measure on X and T a measurable map from X to X. We denote by α a finite partition of X and by CTn,α(x) the element of the partition [formula] which contains the point x. For all point x the information map I is defined by

[formula]

where CTα(x) is the element of α which contains x and χA is the characteristic function defined by

[formula]

The information map satisfies

[formula]

These two properties are easily proved from the definition of I and the fact that T is a surjective map. We refer to [\cite=pete83], [\cite=pomi98] for a detailed proof of () and ().

A simple formulation of the metric entropy with respect to the partition α is given by

[formula]

where

[formula]

is the conditional information map representing the quantity of information given by the partition α knowing the partition β about the point x.

We recall the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem [\cite=brei57] [\cite=pete83].

If μ is a T-ergodic measure, then for μ-almost all x in a compact X we have

[formula]

A bilateral version of Shannon-McMillan-Breiman's theorem

In order to prove the main result (Theorem ) we need to expose two technical lemmas. The proof of Lemma and Theorem requires a bilateral version of the Birkhoff pointwise ergodic theorem: for a T-ergodic measure μ one has

[formula]

for almost all x with a map f in L1. This result is easily deduced from the Birkhoff pointwise ergodic theorem (see [\cite=pomi98]) by breaking up the infinite sum in two proportional parts.

For all integers m and n we have

[formula]

Note that [formula]. Using () we have

[formula]

and from () we get

[formula]

Hence,

[formula]

The same operations on [formula] yields

[formula]

Hence,

[formula]

Iterating similarly t - 1 times on [formula] leads to

[formula]

Taking t = m + n - 1 gives

[formula]

which completes the proof.

If μ is a T ergodic measure then for almost all x in X,

[formula]

For notational convenience, we introduce

[formula]

It is well known that the sequence [formula] converge almost everywhere and in L1. The proof of this convergence (see [\cite=pomi98] and [\cite=pete83]) requires the increasing martingale theorem.

We need to show that

[formula]

Note that

[formula]

If we fix N and let n + m tend to infinity then the first term in the right-hand side of the above inequality goes to zero. Since the map FN belongs to L1 (see [\cite=pete83]), the bilateral version of Birkhoff's ergodic theorem applies and we can assert that

[formula]

Since lim N  →    ∞FN = 0, the dominated convergence theorem implies that [formula] tends to zero which completes the proof.

For a bijective map T from X to X and a T-ergodic measure μ, we have for μ-almost all x

[formula]

where CTn,m,α(x) represents the element of the partition [formula] containing the point x.

Since the sequence [formula] converges to a L1 map and by using the dominated convergence theorem, it follows that

[formula]

for μ-almost all x. The bilateral version of Birkhoff's ergodic theorem implies that for almost all x

[formula]

From Lemma it follows that

[formula]

Using Lemma for almost all x we obtain

[formula]

Since [formula] is bounded for μ-almost all point x, the sequence [formula] tends almost surely to zero. Hence,

[formula]

An illustration

In this example we do not give a definition of the particular discrets dynamical systems called cellular automata; the reader can find a survey in [\cite=bkm97] and the complete proof of this illustration in [\cite=tiss99]. The bilateral version of the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem is needed to establish an inequality between the entropy of a cellular automaton F denoted by hμ(F,α), the entropy hμ(σ) of a particular bijective cellular automaton σ called the shift, and some discret analog of the Lyapunov exponents. Here the measure μ is F-invariant and σ-ergodic.

The standart Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem [\cite=pomi98] says that in the case of an invariant measure μ.

[formula]

In [\cite=tiss99] one proves that there exists some integer and bounded maps fn and gn such that, for all point x, one has

[formula]

with lim n  →    ∞fn(x) + gn(x) =  +   ∞   for μ-almost all point x for a certain class of cellular automata. For those that do not belong to this class, the entropy is equal to zero (see [\cite=tiss99]). With these properties we obtain

[formula]

and

[formula]

The bilateral version of the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem implies that

[formula]

Using the Fatou lemma, we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

are called the left and right average Lyapunov exponents.
