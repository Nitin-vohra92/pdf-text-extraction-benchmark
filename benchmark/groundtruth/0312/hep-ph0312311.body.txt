Introduction

Lepton Flavor Violating (LFV) interactions are rich from the theoretical point of view since they exist at the loop level and the related measurable quantities contain number of free parameters of the model used. In such decays, the assumption of the non-existence of Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) type matrix in the leptonic sector, in the framework of the standard model (SM), forces one to search the physics beyond. The improvement of the experimental measurements of the LFV processes make it possible to understand the new physics effects more accurately. One of the candidate model beyond the SM is the general two Higgs doublet model (2HDM), so called the model III. In this model the LFV interactions are induced by the internal neutral Higgs bosons h0 and A0 and the Yukawa couplings, appearing as free parameters, can be determined by the experimental data. The μ  →  eγ and τ  →  μγ are the examples of LFV interactions and the current limits for their branching ratios (BR's) are 1.2  ×  10- 11 [\cite=Brooks] and 1.1  ×  10- 6 [\cite=Ahmed] respectively. In the literature, there are several studies on the LFV interactions in various models. Such interactions are investigated in a model independent way in [\cite=Chang], in supersymmetric models [\cite=Barbieri1], in the framework of the 2HDM [\cite=Iltan1] [\cite=Diaz].

In this work, we study the LFV processes μ  →  eγ and τ  →  μγ in the framework of the model III, with the addition of one extra spatial dimension. Higher dimensional scenarios has been induced by the string theories as a possible solution to the hierarchy problem of the standard model (SM) and there is an extensive work on this subject in the literature [\cite=Arkani]-[\cite=Lam]. The idea is that the ordinary four dimensional SM is the low energy effective theory of a more fundamental one lying in larger dimensions and the extra dimensions over the 4-dimension are compactified on a circle of a radius R, which is a typical size of an extra dimension. This size has been studied using the present experimental data in several works [\cite=Antoniadis2] [\cite=Carone] and estimated as large as few hundereds of GeV [\cite=Arkani] [\cite=Antoniadis1] [\cite=Antoniadis3], not to contradict with the experiments. Furthermore, the loop effects induced by the internal top quark are sensitive to the KK mode contributions and the size of the extra dimensions has been estimated in the range 200 - 500  GeV, using electroweak precision measurements [\cite=Appelquist], the B -  -mixing [\cite=Papavassiliou],[\cite=Chakraverty] and the flavor changing process b  →  sγ [\cite=Agashe].

In the 4 dimensions, the extra dimension takes the form of Kaluza-Klein (KK) excitations of fields, 2HDM fields in our case, with masses ~  n  /  R. In the case that all 2HDM fields lie in the extra dimension, the extra dimensional momentum is conserved and, in our case, the coupling of Higgs boson-lepton-lepton vertex involves one external zero mode lepton and internal KK mode of lepton and neutral Higgs boson. Such extra dimensions are called universal extra dimensions (UED).

In the LFV μ  →  eγ and τ  →  μγ decays, the effect of one UED is carried by the KK mode of internal neutral Higgs fields, h0, A0, and internal lepton fields, at one loop order, in the model III version of the 2HDM. The non-zero KK modes of neutral Higgs fields H have masses [formula] with mn = n / R. Here mn = n / R is the mass of n'th level KK particle where R is the compactification radius. Similarly, the non-zero KK modes of lepton doublets (singlets) have the left (right) handed lepton fields with masses [formula] and the right (left) handed ones with masses mn. It should be noted that the KK spectrum at each excitation level is nearly degenerate for different lepton flavors since their masses are smaller compared to the mass mn = n / R.

This work is devoted to the the effect of one UED on the BR of the LFV processes μ  →  eγ and τ  →  μγ in the framework of the model III. It is observed that these new effects are tiny for the small values of the compactification radius. Furthermore, these effects are comparable with the BR obtained without including extra dimension, in the case that the neutral Higgs bosons are nearly degenerate and the complexity of the Yukawa coupling is large.

The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we present the BR's of LFV interactions μ  →  eγ and τ  →  μγ in the model III version of the 2HDM with the inclusion of one universal extra dimension. Section 3 is devoted to discussion and our conclusions.

The LFV interactions μ  →  eγ and τ  →  μγ in the general two Higgs Doublet model with the inclusion of one universal extra dimension.

In the model III version of the 2HDM the flavor changing neutral currents (FCNC) at tree level is permitted and the LFV interactions exist with larger BR's, compared to ones obtained in the SM. The main parameters in this calculation are the new Yukawa couplings, that can be chosen complex. The addition of one spatial UED brings new contributions to the BR's of LFV processes at one loop order and the part of the Lagrangian responsible for these interactions is the Yukawa Lagrangian, which reads in 5 dimension

[formula]

with 5-dimensional Yukawa couplings ηE5  ij, ξE5  ij, where i,j are family indices of leptons, φi for i = 1,2, are the two scalar doublets, li and Ej are lepton doublets and singlets respectively. These fields are the functions of xμ and y, where y is the coordinate represents the 5'th dimension. The Yukawa couplings ηE5  ij, ξE5  ij are dimensionful and rescaled to the ones in 4-dimension as [formula], and [formula]. Here φ1 and φ2 are chosen as

[formula]

and the vacuum expectation values are

[formula]

With this choice, the SM particles can be collected in the first doublet and the new particles in the second one. The part which produce FCNC at tree level is

[formula]

Here the Yukawa matrices ξE5  ij have in general complex entries and they are the source of CP violation. Note that in the following we replace ξE with ξEN where "N" denotes the word "neutral". The five dimensional lepton doublets and singlets have both chiralities and the 4-dimensional Lagrangian is constructed by expanding these fields into their KK modes. Besides, the extra dimension denoted by y is compactified on a circle of radius R and the zero modes of the wrong chirality (liR, EiL) are projected out by compactification of the fifth dimension y on an S1 / Z2 orbifold, namely Z2:y  →   - y. The KK decompositions of the lepton and Higgs fields read

[formula]

where φ(0)1,2(x), l(0)iL(x) and E(0)iR(x) are the 4-dimensional Higgs doublets, lepton doublets and lepton singlets respectively. Here L and R denote chiral projections L(R) = 1 / 2(1  ∓  γ5) and they are four dimensional. Each non-zero KK mode of Higgs doublet φ2 (φ1) includes a charged Higgs of mass [formula] (mn), a neutral CP even Higgs of mass [formula] ([formula]), a neutral CP odd Higgs of mass [formula] (mn) with mn = n / R. Here mn = n / R is the mass of n'th level KK particle where R is the compactification radius. Similarly, the non-zero KK modes of lepton doublets (singlets) have the left (right) handed lepton fields with masses [formula] and the right (left) handed ones with masses mn. Notice that the KK spectrum at each excitation level is nearly degenerate for different lepton flavors since their masses are smaller compared to the mass mn = n / R.

Now we will consider the lepton flavor violating processes μ  →  eγ and τ  →  μγ with the addition of one spatial dimension. These processes are good candidates for searching the new physics beyond the SM and for the determination of the free parameters existing. Here we take into account only the neutral Higgs contributions in the lepton sector of the model III and, therefore, the neutral Higgs bosons h0 and A0 are responsible for these interactions. The addition of one extra spatial dimension brings new contribution due to the internal h0n- lni  (l1,2,3  =  τ,μ,e), A0n- lni KK modes and these contributions are calculated by taking the vertices involving one zero mode and two non-zero modes (see Fig. [\ref=fig1]). In the calculations, the on-shell renormalization scheme is used. In this scheme, the self energy diagrams for on-shell leptons vanish since they can be written as

[formula]

However, the vertex diagram a and b in Fig. [\ref=fig1] gives non-zero contribution. Taking only τ lepton for the internal line, the decay width Γ reads as

[formula]

where

[formula]

[formula]. Here the amplitudes A1 and A2 have right and left chirality respectively. The decay width of the other LFV process τ  →  μγ can be calculated using the same procedure and reads as

[formula]

where

[formula]

and [formula]. Here the amplitudes B1 and B2 have right and left chirality, respectively. The functions F(w) and G(w) in eqs. ([\ref=A1A2]) and ([\ref=B1B2])are given by

[formula]

where [formula], [formula], (mextrτ)2 = m2τ + (n / R)2, Qτ is the charge of τ lepton. The Yukawa couplings EN,ij appearing in the expressions are defined as [formula]. In our calculations we take into account only internal τ-lepton contribution since, in our assumption, the couplings EN,ij,  i,j = e,μ, are small compared to EN,τ  i  i = e,μ,τ due to the possible proportionality of them to the masses of leptons under consideration in the vertices and we used parametrization

[formula]

with the CP violating phase θl to extract the complexity of these couplings. Furthermore, we take the Yukawa couplings for the interactions lepton-KK mode of lepton-KK mode of Higgs bosons (h0 and A0) as the same as the ones for the interactions of zero mode fields.

Discussion

The LFV li  →  ljγ (i  ≠  j) interactions exist at the loop level in the model III and the Yukawa couplings DN,ij,i,j = e,μ,τ are the essential parameters used in the calculations of physical quantities related to those decays. The Yukawa couplings are free parameters of the theory and they can be fixed by present and forthcoming experiments. In our calculations, we assume that the Yukawa couplings EN,ij is symmetric with respect to the indices i and j and take EN,ij,  i,j = e,μ, as small compared to EN,τ  i  i = e,μ,τ since the strength of these couplings are related with the masses of leptons denoted by the indices of them, similar to the Cheng-Sher scenerio [\cite=Sher]. For the μ  →  eγ decay the Yukawa couplings EN,τμ and EN,τe play the main role. The first one is restricted by using the experimental uncertainty, 10- 9, in the measurement of the muon anomalous magnetic moment and the upper limit of EN,τμ is predicted as 30  GeV (see [\cite=Iltananomuon] and references therein). For the numerical values of the Yukawa coupling EN,τe, we use the prediction 10- 3 - 10- 2  GeV which respects the experimental upper limit of BR of μ  →  eγ decay, BR  ≤  1.2  ×  10- 11 and predicted value of EN,τμ  ≤  30  GeV (see [\cite=Iltan1] for details). For the τ  →  μγ decay the Yukawa couplings EN,ττ and EN,τμ play the main role and for EN,ττ we use numerical values larger than the upper limit of EN,τμ.

The addition of one extra spatial dimension brings new contribution to the BR of the decays under consideration and this contribution emerges from the KK excitations of the lepton and Higgs fields. In the case that all the fields live in higher dimension [\cite=Carone] [\cite=Appelquist], namely 'universal extra dimension', the KK number at each vertex is conserved and, in the present processes, the additional 'lepton-KK lepton-KK Higgs ' vertices appear. In our calculations we take into account such vertices and assume that the Yukawa couplings existing are the same as the ones existing in the zero-mode case. Since the extra dimension is compactified on a an orbifold such that the zero mode leptons and Higgs fields are 4-dimensional model III particles, there exist a compactification scale 1 / R, where R is the size of the extra dimension. This parameter needs to be restricted and the lower bound for inverse of the compactification radius is estimated as ~  300  GeV [\cite=Appelquist].

In our work we predict the one UED effect on the BR of the LFV processes μ  →  eγ and τ  →  μγ in the framework of the type III 2HDM. These decays exit at least in the one loop level in the model III and the addition of one spatial dimension results in new loop diagrams induced by the KK excitations of the lepton and Higgs fields (see Fig. [\ref=fig1]). In the numerical calculations we study the BR and the ratio of KK mode contributions to the zero mode ones, within a wide range of the compactification scale 1 / R and try to estimate the effects of possible complexity of Yukawa couplings and the mass ratio of neutral Higgs bosons, h0 and A0.

In Fig. [\ref=BRmuegamR], we present the compactification scale 1 / R dependence of the BR for the LFV decay μ  →  eγ for mh0 = 85  GeV, mA0 = 95  GeV, DN,τμ = 30  GeV, for four different values of the coupling DN,τe. The solid (dashed, small dashed, dotted) line represents the BR for DN,τe = 0.5  ×  10- 3(1.0  ×  10- 3,  0.5  ×  10- 2,  1.0  ×  10- 2)  GeV. This figure shows that the BR is not sensitive to the scale 1 / R and therefore the contribution due to the one spatial extra dimension is suppressed. In the BR the main contribution comes from the term which is proportional to the one including the function F (see eq. {[\ref=A1A2]). However, the term including the extra dimension contribution is proportional the suppression factor [formula]. In addition to this the large compactification scale 1 / R causes to decrease the extra dimension contribution.

Fig. [\ref=BRtaumugamR] is devoted to the compactification scale 1 / R dependence of the BR for the LFV decay τ  →  μγ, for mh0 = 85  GeV, mA0 = 95  GeV, DN,τμ = 30  GeV, for six different values of the coupling DN,ττ. The solid (dashed, small dashed, dotted, dot-dashed, double dotted) line represents the BR for DN,ττ = 50  (100,  150,  200,  250,  300)  GeV. In this figure, it is shown that the BR is not sensitive to the scale 1 / R for its large values. In the BR of this decay, the term including the extra dimension contribution does not have the suppression factor xμτ and therefore the sensitivity of the BR is greater for small values of the compactification scale, compared to the one for the μ  →  eγ decay. However, at the large scale 1 / R the extra dimension contribution is negligible.

In Fig. [\ref=BRtaumugamksitautauR], we present the relative behaviors of the coupling DN,ττ and the compactification scale 1 / R for the fixed values of the upper limits BR of the decay τ  →  μγ, for mh0 = 85  GeV, mA0 = 95  GeV, DN,τμ = 30  GeV. The solid (dashed, small dashed) line represents the upper limit of the BR as 10- 6  (10- 7,  10- 8). It is observed that the increasing values of the the scale 1 / R forces the Yukawa coupling to increase to be able to reach the numerical value of the upper limit for the BR of the process and the sensitivity to the scale 1 / R increases with the increasing values of the upper limit of the BR.

At this stage we take the Yukawa coupling DN,ττ complex (see eq. ([\ref=xi])) and study the effects of the complexity of this coupling and the mass ratio of neutral Higgs bosons, h0 and A0, to the ratio of KK mode contributions to the zero mode ones, [formula].

Fig. [\ref=BRtaumugamRatiosintet] represents the parameter sin θττ dependence of the ratio Ratio where BRextr (BR2HDM) is the contribution of the extra dimension effects (the contribution without the extra dimensions), for mA0 = 95  GeV and for five different values of the scale 1 / R. The solid (dashed, small dashed, dotted,dot-dashed) line represents the Ratio for 1 / R = 100  (200,  300,  400,  500)  GeV. This ratio is of the order of 10- 4 - 10- 3 for the intermediate values of the scale 1 / R and slightly increases with the increasing complexity of the Yukawa coupling DN,ττ.

Finally, in Fig. [\ref=BRtaumugamRatioR0] ([\ref=BRtaumugamRatioR05] and [\ref=BRtaumugamRatioR1]) we present the compactification scale 1 / R dependence of the Ratio for sin θττ = 0 (sin θττ = 0.5, sin θττ = 1) and for mA0 = 95  GeV. The solid (dashed, small dashed) line represents the dependence for the mass ratio [formula]. These figures show that the Ratio increases with the increasing mass degeneracy of neutral Higgs bosons h0 and A0, especially for the increasing values of the complexity of the Yukawa coupling. This is an interesting result since the contribution comes from the extra dimensions are sensitive to the mass ratio of neutral Higgs bosons h0 and A0 and also the complexity of the Yukawa coupling. Notice that the extra dimension contributions reach almost to the ordinary ones if the masses of h0 and A0 are nearly degenerate and the complexity of the coupling is high.

Now we would like to present the results briefly.

The BR of μ  →  eγ decay is not sensitive to the scale 1 / R since the term including the extra dimension contribution is proportional the suppression factor [formula] and the large compactification scale 1 / R causes to decrease the extra dimension contribution. The BR of τ  →  μγ decay is not sensitive to the scale 1 / R for its large values. In the BR of this decay, the term including the extra dimension contribution does not have the suppression factor xμτ and therefore the sensitivity of the BR is stronger for small values of the compactification scale, compared to the one of the μ  →  eγ decay.

The contribution comes from the extra dimensions is sensitive to the mass ratio of neutral Higgs bosons h0 and A0 and also the complexity of the Yukawa coupling.

Finally, it is not easy to investigate the extra dimension effects in the LFV decays BR(μ  →  eγ) and BR(τ  →  μγ), however, the more accurate future experimental results of these decays, hopefully, will be helpful in the determination of the signals coming from the extra dimensions.
