Weak cluster points of a sequence and coverings by cylinders

There is a sequence xn∈H with [formula], having 0 as a weak cluster point;

[formula].

Introduction

Let H be an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. It is well known that the weak topology of H has bad sequential properties: a sequence hn∈H having a weak cluster point x, can be free from weakly convergent to x subsequences. Moreover, for a sequence hn∈H with a weak cluster point it is possible to have [formula] [\cite=conkad]. In this paper we study the following question: if a sequence has a weak cluster point, how quick can tend to infinity the norms of the sequence elements? The main tool for estimation of this speed from above will be Ball's "complex plank" theorem - a recent and really beautiful statement from Hilbert space geometry.

Recall, that by a plank of width w in H one means a set of the form

[formula]

where [formula]. According to T.Bang's theorem [\cite=bang], if a sequence Pn of planks of widths wn covers a ball of diameter w , then [formula].

Bang's theorem is true both in real and complex spaces, but in complex spaces it can be dramatically improved. The following theorem is proved by K. Ball [\cite=comp]

Let

[formula]

where [formula], be planks of widths wn in a complex Hilbert space, and let [formula] cover a ball of diameter w centered in origin. Then [formula].

We are going not only to apply the Ball's theorem to our problem, but also to apply our result on weak topology to give some limitations for possible generalizations of the Theorem [\ref=Ball]. After that we discuss generalizations of our weak topology result to other Banach spaces. Allover the paper the letter X will be used for infinite dimensional Banach space, SX and BX - for its unit sphere and unit ball respectively.

Weighted weak convergence

Let P = {pn,m} be an infinite matrix of non-negative numbers with finite rows, satisfying conditions

[formula].

lim n  →    ∞pn,m = 0

We say that a sequence {an} of reals is P-convergent to 0 (P lim an = 0) if

[formula]

Some evident well-known properties of P-convergence are collected in the proposition below.

If   lim an = 0, then P lim an = 0.

If P lim an = 0 and P lim bn = 0, then P lim (an  +  bn) = 0.

If an  ≥  0 and P lim an = 0, then 0 is a cluster point of {an}.

Let X be a Banach space, 1  ≤  p  <    ∞  . A sequence xn∈X is said to be weakly (P,p)-convergent to 0 (w(P,p) lim xn = 0), if for every f∈X* the sequence [formula] P-converges to 0.

If w(P,p) lim xn = 0, then 0 is a weak cluster point of {xn}.

We must prove that for arbitrary finite set {fk}mk = 1  ⊂  X* and arbitrary ε  >  0 there is an arbitrarily big [formula] with [formula]. By definition of w(P,p)-convergence and item ([\ref=p2]) of Proposition [\ref=p-conv]

[formula]

The rest we deduce from item ([\ref=p3]) of Proposition [\ref=p-conv].

The main result

The following properties of a sequence an > 0 are equivalent: (a)    [formula]. (b)  There is a sequence xn in a Hilbert space H with [formula], and there is a sequence P = {pn,m} of weights such that w(P,2) lim xn = 0. (c)  There is a sequence xn in a Hilbert space H with [formula], having 0 as a weak cluster point.

(a) [formula] (b). Assume [formula] and consider the sequence xn = anen, where en is an orthonormal sequence in H. Introduce the following sequence P = {pn,m} of weights:

[formula]

when m  ≤  n and pn,m = 0 for m  >  n. Then for every f∈H we have

[formula]

which means w(P,2)-convergence of xn to 0. (b) [formula] (c). This is given by the Proposition [\ref=wp-conv]. (c) [formula] (a). Let

[formula]

and let xn∈H be vectors with [formula]. We may assume that H is a complex Hilbert space, since otherwise we may embed H into its complexification. Define planks

[formula]

The width of Pn equals a- 1n. Using ([\ref=R]) and the Theorem [\ref=Ball] we deduce that the planks Pn cannot cover the whole space H (they even cannot cover a ball of radius R  +  ε). So there is an element h∈H for which all the inequalities

[formula]

hold true at the same time. This h separates our sequence xn from 0.

A comment to the Ball's Theorem [\ref=Ball]

Why estimates for coverings by real and complex planks differ so strongly? A possible explanation looks as follows: a complex plank of width r looks not like a slice between two hyperplanes, but like an orthogonal cylinder having as a base a circle of the radius r / 2. If one tries to cover a circle of radius R by circles of radiuses rn, then calculating corresponding areas one can easily see, that [formula]. This explanation leads to the following hypothesis: let [formula] be a fixed number, and let Cn be orthogonal cylinders in a real Hilbert space H, having as their bases k-dimensional balls of radiuses rn respectively and [formula]. Then [formula]. With the help of the Theorem [\ref=main] we can show that this natural hypothesis fails already for k = 3. In fact, assume that the abovementioned hypothesis is true for k = 3. Consider a sequence xn∈H, [formula], having 0 as a weak cluster point, but with [formula] (such a sequence exists due to the Theorem [\ref=main]). Consider an auxiliary Hilbert space [formula] - the orthogonal direct sum of 3 copies of the original space H. Introduce cylinders Cn in H1 as follows:

[formula]

Cn are orthogonal cylinders in H1, having as their bases 3-dimensional balls of radiuses a- 1n. According to our hypothesis, these cylinders do not cover the whole space H1, i.e. there is an g = (g1,g2,g3)∈H1 which does not belong to any of these cylinders. But this means, that the weak neighborhood of 0

[formula]

separates all the xn from 0. Contradiction.

Generalization to Banach spaces: the role of finite representability and cotype

Let X be a Banach space, 2  ≤  p  ≤    ∞  . The space lp is finitely representable in X if for every ε  >  0 and for every [formula] there are elements [formula] such that

[formula]

for all selections of coefficients bj.

Let X be a Banach space, 2  ≤  p  ≤    ∞   and let 1  ≤  p'  ≤  2 be dual to p exponent. Let moreover lp be finitely representable in X and an > 0 satisfy condition [formula]. Then there is a sequence xn∈X with [formula], having 0 as a weak cluster point. Moreover there is a matrix P = {pn,m} of weights such that w(P,p') lim xn = 0.

Fix an ε  <  1 / 8. First choose [formula] to satisfy condition

[formula]

Define P = {pk,m} as follows:

[formula]

when nk  <  m  ≤  nk + 1 and pk,m = 0 otherwise. Using step-by-step finite reperesentability of lp in X select sequence en∈SX, for which

[formula]

for all k and bj. Now define xn  =  anen. Then for every f∈X* we have

[formula]

which means w(P,p')-convergence of xn to 0. By the Proposition [\ref=wp-conv] this means that 0 is a weak cluster point of {xn}.

Together with Dvoretzky's theorem (l2 is finitely representable in every infinite-dimensional Banach space) this gives us the following:

For every infinite-dimensional Banach space X and every selection of an > 0 satisfying condition [formula] there is a sequence xn∈X with [formula], having 0 as a weak cluster point.

Recall, that a Banach space X has M-cotype p  <    ∞   if there is a constant C  >  0 such that for every finite collection of vectors {xk}nk = 1  ⊂  X there are coefficients γk  =    ±  1 for which

[formula]

Due to Maurey - Pisier theorem a space X has an M-cotype if and only if l∞ is not finitely representable in X. A small survey of facts concerning M-cotype can be found in [\cite=kadkad].

The Theorem [\ref=fin-p] together with another Ball's result [\cite=ball1] (generalization of the Bang's real plank theorem to arbitrary Banach spaces) gives us an analog of Theorem [\ref=main] for spaces without cotype (in particular for c0). In this case the characterization does not involve square exponentials.

Let X be a Banach spaces in which l∞ is finitely representable. Then the following properties for a sequence an > 0 are equivalent:

There is a sequence xn∈X with [formula], and there is a sequence P = {pn,m} of weights such that w(P,1) lim xn = 0.

There is a sequence xn∈X with [formula], having 0 as a weak cluster point;

[formula].

The next theorem gives us a relationship between weak weighted limit and cotype.

Let X be a Banach space of M-cotype 2  ≤  p  ≤    ∞   and let 1  ≤  p'  ≤  2 be dual to p exponential. Let xn∈X be a sequence such that w(P,p') lim xn = 0 for some matrix P = {pn,m} of weights. Then [formula].

Since lim n  →    ∞pn,m = 0, using small perturbation argument we may assume that there are m1(n)  <  m2(n), m1(n)  →    ∞  , such that pn,m = 0 for m outside the interval (m1(n),m2(n)). By the closed graph theorem, applied to the operator [formula],

[formula]

there is a constant C > 0 such that

[formula]

for all [formula] and all x*∈X*. So

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

where C1 is the constant from the definition of M-cotype. Applying Hölder inequality to [formula] we deduce

[formula]

which means that [formula].
