Nuclear Forces and Few-Nucleon Studies Based on Chiral Perturbation Theory

Introduction

The basic questions posed in few-nucleon physics have a long tradition. Already E.Wigner [\cite=wigner33] and J.Schwinger [\cite=gerjuoy42] asked, whether one can understand the binding energies of the helium nuclei on the basis of two-nucleon (NN) forces and the Schrödinger equation. Over the years, robust mathematical formulations, which are strictly equivalent to the Schrödinger equation, have been developed. These are the Faddeev-Yakubovsky equations [\cite=faddeev61] [\cite=yakubovsky67], the Greens Function Monte Carlo [\cite=carlson87], the stochastic variational [\cite=varga95], the Gaussian basis [\cite=kamimura88] and the hyperspherical harmonics [\cite=ripelle83] methods, which together with modern NN forces like AV18 [\cite=wiringa95], Nijm I,II [\cite=stoks94] and CD-Bonn [\cite=machleidt96] allow for an unambiguous answer: the available NN forces alone underbind light nuclei. Some examples for theoretical binding energies in comparison to experimental ones are displayed in Table [\ref=table1]. Also in 3N scattering quite a few discrepancies appear using NN forces only [\cite=glockle96] [\cite=sekiguchiconf]. A missing dynamical ingredient, naturally suggested in meson theory, is the three-nucleon (3N) force. First trial models built around the old Fujita-Miyazawa force [\cite=fujita57], a 2π-exchanges force with an intermediate Δ, are the Tucson-Melbourne (TM) [\cite=coon01] and the Urbana IX (URB) [\cite=pudliner97] forces, which contribute additional binding and can be adjusted to the 3H binding energy in conjunction with the available NN forces. Then one can predict binding energies beyond A=3 and 3N scattering observables. As an example, we display in Table [\ref=table2] the α-particle binding energies for various force combinations, which come rather close to the experimental value [\cite=nogga02b] . For the partially promising results in 3N scattering we refer the reader to [\cite=witala01a] [\cite=kuros02b] and [\cite=sekiguchiconf]. For nuclei beyond A=4 see [\cite=carlson98] and [\cite=pieper01a], where extensions to the Urbana IX model were applied. A systematic approach and consistency between NN and 3N forces are still missing. In the following we sketch the concepts of a consistent approach based on effective field theory (EFT) constrained by chiral symmetry, show resulting nuclear forces and first applications in the few-nucleon sector. We end with a brief outlook.

The concepts

We start with a brief reminder. The QCD Lagrangian for massless up and down quarks is invariant under global flavor SU(2)L  ×  SU(2)R transformations or, equivalently, under vector and axial vector transformations. This is called chiral symmetry. Among other facts, the absence of parity doublets of low mass hadrons suggests that the axial symmetry is spontaneously broken. The pions are natural candidates for the required Goldstone bosons. They acquire a nonvanishing mass due to the explicit symmetry breaking caused by the small up and down quark masses. We are interested in low energy nuclear physics, where the degrees of freedom are the composite hadrons. Their interaction has to be described by an effective Lagrangian, which could not yet be derived from QCD. Nevertheless, at least one important requirement is known: the effective Lagrangian has to be constrained by chiral symmetry and should include explicitly symmetry breaking parts proportional to powers of the quark masses. The application we have in mind is for generic nucleon momenta comparable to the π-mass and somewhat higher, but still smaller than the ρ-mass. In that case a standard one-boson exchange picture turns into NN contact forces for the heavy meson exchanges and only the one-pion exchange is kept explicitly. The construction of the most general effective Lagrangian out of pion and nucleon fields constrained by chiral symmetry is nontrivial due to the fact that no nontrivial linear realization (representation) of SU(2)  ×  SU(2) with pion fields can be formed. The formalism has been worked out in seminal papers by [\cite=weinberg68] [\cite=coleman69]. The chirally invariant expressions are build up out of the nucleon fields and covariant derivatives (nonlinear in the pion fields) and of the pion and nucleon fields. There is an infinite number of possible terms, which can be ordered according to the parameter

[formula]

characterizing the vertices. Here d is the number of derivatives and n the number of nucleon field operators. Spontaneously broken chiral symmetry enforces Δ  ≥  0.

The first few terms for the interacting effective Lagrangian after a p / m expansion (for heavy baryon formalism see [\cite=jenkins91]) look like

[formula]

The terms are grouped according to Δ = 0,1 and 2. The parameters of Leff, the so called low-energy constants (LEC's), can be partitioned in several groups: some can be determined in the π-N system (gA,F,c1,c3,c4) and others from nucleonic systems only (CS,CT,E1,C1,...C7). The constant D1 also affects the NNπ system. All these constants are of course not determined by chiral symmetry, but have to be adjusted to experimental data.

Nuclear Forces

To arrive at nuclear forces the pion degrees of freedom have to be eliminated. We use an unitary transformation of the field theoretical Hamiltonian [\cite=epelbaumphd] [\cite=epelbaoum98b] going back to Okubo [\cite=okubo54]. That transformation decouples the purely nucleonic Fock space from the one, which includes at least one pion. That elimination process is controlled by the low-momentum expansion [\cite=epelbaumphd]. A resulting NN force V receives contributions of the order

[formula]

where Q is a generic external momentum and Λ is the mass scale, which enters the (renormalized) values of the LEC's. The power ν is given by

[formula]

here L is the number of loops and Vi the number of vertices of type i. Therefore, if one sticks to momenta Q such that Q  ≪  Λ and Q / Λ is a small quantity, the effects of nuclear forces decrease with increasing ν. Clearly, since Δ  ≥  0, one has ν  ≥  0. Thus, if one wants to derive nuclear forces in the low-Q regime with a given accuracy, one needs only a finite number of terms in Leff with the smallest Δ's and the finite number of pions.

The first few orders for nuclear forces can easily be listed using the terms in Eq. (2). The leading order (LO) for ν = 0 and N = 2 requires L = 0 and Δi = 0. This leads to two types of vertices with d = 1, n = 2 and d = 0, n = 4, which occur in the one-pion exchange and two contact forces, respectively. ν  =  1 does not exist and the next-to-leading order (NLO) with ν = 2 and N = 2 requires either L = 1, Δi = 0 or L = 0, Δi = 2. In the first case one can form various types of 2π-exchange processes with d = 1, n = 2 vertices; in the second case one encounters additional NN contact forces with 7 different types of vertices with d = 2, n = 4. At NNLO (ν = 3) additional 2π-exchange NN forces with higher order vertices occur. Also the first nonvanishing 3N forces of three different topologies show up. They are without loops (L = 0) and with Δ  ≤  1 vertices. A 2π-exchange process, a 1π-exchange between a NN contact force and the third nucleon and a pure 3N contact force are of this form. Each of the latter two depends on one unknown LEC, whereas the 2π-exchange is parameter-free in the sense that the LEC's are determined in the πN-system. That hierarchy of nuclear forces is illustrated in Fig. [\ref=fig1]. Thus, chiral EFT provides a natural explanation why 3N forces are less important than 2N forces, 4N forces are less important than 3N forces, etc. We would also like to emphasize that all forces are analytically given and we refer the reader to [\cite=epelbaum02a].

The derived nuclear forces are valid only at low Q and have unphysical behavior at large Q (they grow with increasing momenta). The Schrödinger equation needs therefore to be regularized. This is achieved by introducing Vreg according to

[formula]

Λ should be not too small in order not to cut off the physics of the π-exchanges and not too large in order to exclude uncontrolled high-energy physics. It turned out that

[formula]

is a good choice. The Λ-dependence is expected to get weaker with increasing order in the expansion [\cite=lepage97] [\cite=gegelia01]. Notice that the original idea and the first applications of chiral perturbation theory to nuclear systems go back to [\cite=weinberg91] [\cite=ordonez96] [\cite=kaiser97]. The higher orders have been worked out by N. Kaiser [\cite=kaiser02] and also applied in [\cite=entem03a].

Application in the Few-Nucleon Sector

The first step is the adjustment of the LEC's. There are 2 (9) such constants at LO (NLO), which are adjusted to the NN S- and P-wave phase shifts. The only additional LEC's appearing at NNLO are c1,3,4, which can in principle be taken from the pion-nucleon system (see [\cite=epelbaum02a] for more details). Our results for selected partial waves are illustrated in Fig. [\ref=fig2]. In the 3N system we adjust the two LEC's entering the 3N force to the 3H binding energy and the doublet nd scattering length and [\cite=epelbaum02c]. Then, up to and including NNLO, all constants are fixed. We now display some results and refer the reader to [\cite=epelbaum02c] for more details. The α-particle binding energy for Λ = 500 (600) MeV/c turns out to be 29.51 (29.98) MeV which comes close to the "experimental" value 29.8 MeV (This is a corrected value for np forces only). Also the results for 3N scattering look mostly promising and we display a few examples in Figs. [\ref=fig3] and [\ref=fig4]. Finally we show in Fig. [\ref=fig5] an application to 6Li which has been elaborated in the no-core shell model framework [\cite=nogga03b].

Summary and Outlook

EFT and chiral symmetry is a systematic path towards nuclear forces. The nuclear forces are built out of multi-pion exchanges, which are parameter free and a string of contact forces, which parameterize the not yet understood short range physics. 3N forces are consistent to 2N forces. The dominance of 2N forces over 3N forces is naturally explained in this theoretical framework. The regularization of the pion loops, which removes uncontrolled high energy (short range) physics, has recently been formulated using the spectral function representation [\cite=epelbaum03a] [\cite=epelbaum03b] and the application to NN forces at NNNLO(ν=4) is in progress [\cite=epelbaumprep]. At this order quite a few new 3N forces appear. They are parameter free and, therefore, their effects on few-nucleon observables will be of special interest. Relativistic corrections can be taken into account and are expected to converge rapidly since the nucleon momenta stay well below the nucleon mass.
