The data analysis of HD 209458 Lyman α transit occultation

The transit of a giant extrasolar planet offers a unique opportunity to investigate the spectral features of its atmosphere. Three transits of HD  209458 were sampled in 2001 with the STIS spectrograph onboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We used the G140M grating with the 52"x0.1" slit. For each transit, three consecutive HST orbits were scheduled such that the first orbit ended before the first contact to serve as a reference, and the two following ones were partly or entirely within the transit.

The background level was systematically increasing in the two-dimensional (2D) images from one exposure to the next within each of the three visits but always remained below 2% of the peak intensity of the stellar signal. We therefore reprocessed the 2D images by using two independent approaches.The resulting difference between both approaches are found to be negligible, showing that systematic errors generated through the background corrections are small compared to the statistical errors.

The geocoronal emission filled the aperture of the spectrograph, allowing us to remove it at the position of the target star. We evaluated its variation both along the slit and from one exposure to another. We concluded that the geocoronal contamination can be removed with high enough accuracy outside the central region (1215.5Å <  λ  <  1215.8Å, named "Geo"). Because of potential problems in this domain, it is excluded from the present analysis.

The three exposures outside the transits and the three entirely within the transits were respectively co-added to improve the signal to noise ratio. An obvious absorption in the hydrogen line profile is detected during the transits, mainly over the blue side of the line, and possibly at the top of the red peak (between -130 km s- 1 and +100 km s- 1). To characterize this signature better, we have defined two spectral domains: "In" and "Out" of the absorption. The "In" domain covers the interval 1215.15Å-1216.1Å excepted the "Geo" region. The "Out" domain is the remaining wavelength coverage within the interval 1214.4Å-1216.8Å. During the transit, the corresponding "In" to "Out" flux ratio appears significantly below 1. We derived that the Lyman α line is reduced by 15±  4% (1σ).

We have investigated the possibility that a bad estimate of the geocoronal correction might cause the signal we detected. the change of the geocoronal correction by +30% to -100% (or even no "Geo" correction) has a negligible impact on the evaluation of the "In"/"Out" ratios; the absorption signature is still perfectly visible in all cases and even when no correction at all is applied. This indicates that the signal cannot be a consequence of an improper geocoronal correction. To further show that the tail of the geocorona does not carry the detected transit signal, we looked at the "Geo"/"Out" signal for the uncorrected spectra. They are random fluctuations around the average: there is no "transit" signal in the geocoronal variations. We conclude that the geocorona does not contaminate the transit signature seen in the "In"/"Out" ratio (see Vidal-Madjar and Lecavelier, this book).

Since the HD209458 type is close to solar (G0V), we have evaluated the "In" over "Out" ratio in the solar Lyman α line profile as measured by the SUMER instrument onboard SOHO (Lemaire et al. 2002) during the last solar cycle from 1996 to 2001. During this time, the total solar Lyman α flux varies by about a factor two, while its "In"/"Out" ratio varies by less than ±  6%. This suggests that the detected absorption is not of stellar origin but rather due to a transient absorption occurring during the planetary transits.

A bright hot spot on the stellar surface hidden during the planetary transit is also excluded. Such a hot spot would have to contribute about 15% of the Lyman α flux over the 1.5% of the stellar surface occulted by the planet, in contradiction with usual Lyman α inhomogeneities observed on the Sun (Prinz, 1974). Furthermore, this spot would have to be perfectly aligned with the planet throughout the transit, at the same latitude as the Earths direction, and with a peculiar narrow single-peaked profile confined over the "In" spectral region.   In summary, the observed 15% Lyman α intensity drop is not due to a geocoronal or stellar contamination but corresponds to an occultation by an object of 4.3 Jupiter radii; this is clearly beyond the Roche limit. Furthermore, the spectral absorption width shows independently that the atoms have large velocities relative to the planet. Thus hydrogen atoms must be escaping the planetary atmosphere.
