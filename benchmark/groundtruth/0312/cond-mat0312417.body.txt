Coherent Quantum Tunneling of Bose-Einstein Condensates in Optical Lattices.

In the present note we will study Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) tunneling in an optical lattice. It has been verified experimentally in one dimensional optical lattices that there is coherent quantum tunneling in BEC's[\cite=becj]. We will try to take an in-depth look at tunneling in optical lattices in 3 dimensions. We take the well tunneling amplitude, or hopping, to be t. In order for the tunneling to be relevant, this energy scale needs to be larger than the kinetic energy scale for the whole lattice:

[formula]

where m is the mass of the bosons and Ω is the volume of the whole lattice. If the kinetic energy of the lattice overwhelms the hopping, the tight-binding approximation with bosons hopping from lattice site to lattice site with tunneling t is no longer valid.

On dimensional grounds one expects the tunneling rate to be proportional to t / . On the other hand, the proportionality factor should be a universal dimensionless function of the number of lattice sites NL, the number of bosons N and/or the number of bosons in the condensate N0, and the different energy scales in the problem. Besides t and 2  /  2mΩ2 / 3, there is the on-site repulsion at each well U, the well depth ε, and the kinetic energy scale of each well:

[formula]

where V is the volume of each well ~  a3 with a the interlattice spacing. We, of course, have NLV  =  Ω. Thus the tunneling rate or "Josephson" current is

[formula]

The universal function F will behave differently in different physical regimes. For example, if the wells are very deep, ε  ≫  t, the tunneling rate should be exponentially suppressed J  ~   exp ( - αε / t) with α a positive numerical constant. Such a case is uninteresting for the collective lattice dynamics of the boson system and will not be considered here. Hence we will never write the dependence of the function F on t / ε. We will study tunneling when there are a large number of bosons in the adjacent sites between which tunneling is occurring. This can correspond to the case where there is a very large number of bosons in the whole lattice or when the condensate is placed at two sites and its tunneling behavior monitored.

The BEC on an optical lattice can be described by the Bose Hubbard Hamiltonian. Since we have a large number of bosons per well, there will be a BEC in each well with its own Bose Hubbard Hamiltonian. There will be a tunneling term t between adjacent wells. We then have

[formula]

where [formula] are bosonic creation and destruction operators with momentum [formula] on the right well, while the "barred" operators correspond to the left well. [formula] is the kinetic energy of a boson within each well. The wells are taken as large boxes. This approximation is valid as wells in optical lattices are fairly large (a  ~  100's of nm) in typical lattices[\cite=ari1].

As long as the bosons within each well are Bose condensed, the individual well Hamiltonian can be diagonalized by the Bogolyubov method[\cite=bog]. If we keep the leading term in the interactions, we obtain the reduced Bogolyubov Hamiltonian

[formula]

with [formula]. The number in the condensate, N0, is determined uniquely by the number of bosons in each well, N, and the repulsion U. We see that the relevant parameter that sets the scale for the interaction for the BEC is the combination UN0 / NL. Hence the universal dimensionless function that determines the tunneling current enhancement does not depend on U,N0 and NL independently, but rather

[formula]

The reduced Bogolyubov Hamiltonian ([\ref=redbog]) is diagonalized by the Bogolyubov canonical transformation

[formula]

[formula]

where θ is the relative phase between the superfluid order parameters, which is in general nonzero, and

[formula]

with

[formula]

being the dispersion of the quasiparticle-like excitations of the system with [formula]. As k  →  0 the dispersion becomes phononic, which leads to dissipationless flow, i.e. superflow, by the Landau argument[\cite=landau]. We note that atomic BECs are superfluids as they have a nonzero sound speed[\cite=becs] and reduced scattering at long wavelengths[\cite=scat1] [\cite=scat2] [\cite=scat3]. The dispersion at large k becomes 2k2 / 2m, which leads to dissipative flow. Notice that the crossover between dissipative and nondissipative flow happens at [formula]. This defines the coherence length of the superfluid [formula].

When the system is probed at length scales L  >  ξ it responds collectively as a superfluid, while at length scales L  <  ξ it behaves like a gas of independent bosonic particles, thus responding dissipatively. We note that an infinite system would become superfluid for any U no matter how small, as one can always go to a long enough length scale to see the system respond collectively as a superfluid. In here we do not have in mind infinite systems but finite wells of superfluid. In this case of finite systems, if the kinetic energy scale of the well, Tw, is greater than the effective interaction, UN0 / NL, the system will not be a superfluid as the linear size of the system, V1 / 3, is less than the coherence length of the superfluid. Independent of whether the bosons are superfluid in each well, the system could still be a superfluid within the whole lattice.

For the full lattice, when the kinetic energy scale is set by tunneling between sites ([formula]), the coherence length is [formula]. The size of the lattice is, of course, L = NLa and the condition for superfluidity (ξ  <  L) is U / t  >  1 / 4N0NL. We see that either for a very large system or very large number of bosons, it becomes arbitrarily easy to become superfluid in the sense that an arbitrarily small U will order the boson fluid into a superfluid at low enough temperature. Conversely, as we make the system small, or we reduce the number of bosons, it becomes harder to order into a superfluid, which will show up experimentally as increased dissipation rates.

Even though a high enough U can order the system into a superfluid, too high a U will make it into a Mott insulator[\cite=fisher] [\cite=us]. The transition to the Mott insulator can be continuous[\cite=fisher] or discontinuous[\cite=us]. The continuous transition occurs when there is a superfluid[\cite=fisher] in each well and U prevents Josephson tunneling between wells. The continuous transition only happens for a commensurate number of bosons per site. When the bosons in the wells are not superfluid within wells the transition is discontinuous and happens irrespective of whether the number of bosons per site is integer or not[\cite=us]. The second transition always happens when the number of bosons per site or U / t are suffciently small as in these cases ξ > a.

We now proceed to evaluate the current operator[\cite=joseph]

[formula]

where [formula] is the tunneling part of the Hamiltonian and T denotes time. We note that the ground state of the reduced Hamiltonian ([\ref=redbog]) when t = 0 is an outer product of the Bogolyubov ground states for each well, which we denote as our "vacuum" state |0〉. The excited states of such a system are denoted by |n〉 and are constructed by applying any number of Bogolyubov creation operators to the vacuum state. The energies of such states, En, will be the sum of the energies of each of the operators. When t  ≠  0 there will be tunneling between the two wells, which can be calculated accurately from linear response theory as long as the number of atoms within the wells is large. For such a calculation the only relevant excited states are two quasiparticle states, one in each well, with opposite momenta, i.e. [formula], with energies [formula]. This calculation was first done by B. D. Josephson for Cooper paired fermionic superconductors[\cite=joseph]. We will follow his calculation closely. When the wells are superfluid, the tunneling current is dominated by coherent tunneling of Bogolyubov correlated pairs.

In order to calculate in linear response theory[\cite=pines], we turn on Ht adiabatically from time T =  -   ∞  , starting from the ground state of the noninteracting system at such a time. If we expand the wavefunction in terms of the noninteracting eigenstates [formula], we obtain the well known formula an(T) = δn,0 - i exp (iEnT  /  〈n|Ht|0〉 / (iEn  +  ε), where the vacuum state energy E0 has been chosen to be 0. The parameter ε was introduced to control the adiabatic switching of the interaction. The causal limit ε  →  0+ should be always understood. Our interaction is turned on fully at time T = 0 and the wavefunction of the interacting system is given by |Ψ(0)〉  =  |0〉  +  |δφ〉 where[\cite=pines]

[formula]

The Josephson current is given by [formula] complex conjugate. With

[formula]

we obtain

[formula]

analogous to the fermionic superconducting case[\cite=joseph]. We note that if the phase difference between the order parameters, θ, is 0 there is no Josephson tunneling. Since [formula], we obtain for the enhancement factor F = J

[formula]

In order to estimate this quantity we approximate the quasiparticle dispersion as phononic, [formula], and we cut off the high momenta at kc of the order of the inverse coherence length. Converting the sum into an integral

[formula]

Note that this integral is infrared divergent but the divergence gets cut-off by the inverse linear well size V1 / 3. We finally obtain for the enhancement

[formula]

In order for the system to be superfluid at all within a well we must have V1 / 3  >  ξ, otherwise there will not be Josephson tunneling per se and the calculation of tunneling will have to be done for noninteracting bosons trapped in wells. This condition implies that UN0 / TwNL  >  1. Therefore, F  >  tNL / 16π2UN0. For typical lattices[\cite=ari1], t is of the order of around kHz's. NL is about 50, the number of bosons is about 5000, so that the number of Bose condensed atoms per well N0  ~  N and thus N0 / NL  ~  100. Values of U are more uncertain, but they range from tens to a hundred Hz, so that t / U  >  10. We finally obtain F  >  2. Therefore, when we have few hundred bosons per site, Josephson tunneling will be enhanced from the single particle tunneling value t / . Of course, for other values of the lattice parameters, it need not be enhanced. In extreme cases, it can be enhanced quite a bit. Since the logarithm in expression ([\ref=f]) can never be negative due to the precondition for Josephson tunneling to be possible at all (V1 / 3  >  ξ), F is single valued. We then see that measurements of the Josephson "enhancement" F can be used to estimate the values of the on-site repulsion U if the other experimental parameters are known.

We now study the case when the linear size of the wells is too small (V1 / 3  <  ξ). In this case the interaction cannot order the system into a superfluid, and its only effect is a renormalization of the mass of the bosons. Hence the system is described by the Hamiltonian ([\ref=bosonh]) with U = 0 and m the renormalized mass of the bosons. There is no Josephson tunneling per se as the system is not superfluid. On the other hand, there can be coherent quantum tunneling of the (nonsuperfluid) boson liquid between wells.

The Hamiltonian ([\ref=bosonh]) with U = 0 is diagonalized by the canonical operators

[formula]

to yield

[formula]

The Heisenberg equations of motion lead to the following time dependent operators [formula] and [formula]. The common phase factor [formula] will be dropped as only phase differences affect the physics. From these time dependent operators one immediately obtains the operators into which [formula] [formula] and their conjugates develop under Hamiltonian evolution:

[formula]

The "barred" and "unbarred" operators are orthogonal raising and lowering operators as unitary Hamiltonian evolution is a canonical transformation thus preserving the commutation relations of the operators at time zero.

We can now calculate the coherent tunneling current between two wells. We take the right well to have (N  +  M) / 2 bosons and the left well with (N  -  M) / 2 bosons. The initial wavefunction is then

[formula]

where the subscript 0 means the smallest momentum state into which the bosons condensed. The wavefunction at time T, |Ψ(T)〉, has the exact same dependence on the operators [formula], [formula] that |Ψ(0)〉 has on [formula], [formula]. In order to obtain the coherent tunneling current J we need to evaluate [formula] with [formula] counting the excess number of bosons in the right well. Using

[formula]

we obtain the tunneling current

[formula]

where the periodicity is an artifact of having a two site system. The proportionality of the tunneling current on the initial number difference of bosons between the sites, M, is not an artifact. Hence the tunneling current could be quite large if the number of bosons is very different between the different sites. The current can also be zero if the number of bosons is equal between wells. The fact that the current goes to zero for short times T  →  0 is also not an artifact since, for short times, the system cannot know if it is a closed two site system or a large system.

In the present note we studied quantum tunneling of BEC's in optical lattices. For the case when bosons within each well are superfluid, we have Josephson tunneling among the wells For typical lattice parameters the Josephson current will be somewhat enhanced from t / , but this need not be so. The enhancement factor will depend on lattice parameters. When the bosons in each well are not superfluid, there is coherent quantum tunneling of essentially free bosons between the wells. This tunneling is proportional to the boson number difference between the wells essentially due to Bose statistics.
