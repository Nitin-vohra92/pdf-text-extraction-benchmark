Metrological constraints on the variability of the fundamental constants e, [formula], and c

Recently evidence has been reported for a possible time evolution of the fine structure constant on the cosmological time scale. The study of absorbtion spectra of distant quasars yields Δα  /  α  ~  10- 4 over the redshift range 0.5 < z < 3.5 [\cite=webb1] . Preliminary results of a new study based on a larger sample support the earlier results [\cite=webb2]. However, a similar analysis performed by a different group finds no evidence for the evolution of α: Δα  /  α  =  ( - 0.06  ±  0.06)  ×  10- 5 over the redshift range 0.4 < z < 2.3 [\cite=sri]. Also, the variation of the fine structure constant in 187Re decay over the age of the solar system (corresponding to [formula]) has been found consistent with zero at the level of Δα  /  α  ~  10- 7 [\cite=oli]. The source for these discrepancies is yet to be understood.

The constancy of the proton-to-electron mass ratio μ = me / mp is also being investigated [\cite=iva].

Motivation for possible variability of fundamental constants appears within different contexts such as Kaluza-Klein theories, superstring theories and other models. We will not go into theoretical discussion of what would be a microscopic model that could explain why fundamental constants change ( see e.g. [\cite=uzan] [\cite=mag] [\cite=we] [\cite=tob] and references therein ). Apart from specific model building, a more general type of analysis is needed which would start with kinematical (i.e., metrological) considerations. The role of the metrological approach is to complement and clarify the specific models (rather than to substitute them).

The question arises: if the fine structure constant does indeed evolve with time then which of the constants e, [formula], and c are evolving and how? This question has been at the centre of recent debate [\cite=duff1] [\cite=duff2] [\cite=mof] [\cite=uzan] [\cite=mag] [\cite=nat] [\cite=fla] and is the main topic of this paper. Another issue of contention is the variation of dimensional quantities, where on one hand it is claimed that time variation of dimensional constants is a meaningless concept. On the other hand, a number of theories have been proposed in which one (or more) dimensional constants (such as G, e or c) are varying.

Our analysis will explicitely show in what sense and to what extent the time evolution of dimensional constants is meaningful and when it becomes misleading; hence bringing the two points of view closer to each other and eliminating some controversy in this area.

Fundamental constants and basic units form an interdependent system. This is because the modern definitions of basic units (metre, second etc.) are given in terms of processes controlled by the magnitudes of the fundamental constants (α, [formula], c etc.). If fundamental constants would change with time then, generally, so would the basic units.

Consequently, we face the following problem: how to define the basic units in such a way that they stay invariant even though the fundamental constants (which are involved in their definitions) may change? This problem should arise in any specific theory of α variation at the stage when the contact with experiment is made; it is therefore desirable to perform a model-independent analysis first.

The purpose of the this paper is to propose a possible solution to this problem and to discuss some of its implications. In particular, we will show that the time-dependence of [formula], c, and e can be reconstructed uniquely from the time dependence of α provided that the choice of basic units is fixed.

As a basis for our study we employ the standard methods of dimensional and metrological analysis supplemented by an additional postulate requiring that the fundamental units should be time-independent. In other words, we require that the units should be fixed even though constants can vary. Although it is possible, in principle, to use the system of time-dependent units that would greatly complicate both theory and experiment. Theoretically, one would have to keep track of time derivatives of units in all equations making them much longer; the number of experimental parameters to be measured would also greatly increase.

For simplicity and correspondence with the previous literature, the centimetre-gram-second (CGS) system of units will be used. (This assumption, however, is not important for the essence of our argument.) Also, as there is no strong observational or experimental evidence for the time-dependence of the fundamental constants apart from α, such as the mass ratios (me / mp, me / mNucl, ) and g-factors it will be assumed here that they do not vary with time (for theoretical discussions see,e.g., [\cite=cal] [\cite=lan] [\cite=dent]).

To start with, our units of time, length and mass can be defined in the same way as the SI units (with proper scaling if necessary). Thus 1cm is the length travelled by light in a vacuum during a time interval of 1/299 792 45800 of a second, the second is the duration of 9 192 631 770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the cesium-133 atom and 1g is 1/1000 part of the mass of the international platinum-iridium prototype of the kilogram.

These definitions imply that the magnitudes of 1 second (s), 1 centimetre ([formula]) and 1 gram (g) depend on the magnitudes of the fundamental constants as follows:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

It will be shown that the time evolution of c, [formula] and e crucially depend on the definitions of the centimetre and the second. To illustrate this point, several alternative definitions of the centimetre and second (see e.g. [\cite=coh]) are introduced in the following way.

A "bar centimetre" is 1/100 of the length of the international platinum-iridium prototype of the metre. Its dependence on the fundamental constants is controlled by the Bohr radius:

[formula]

The "krypton centimetre" is the length equal to the 16507.6373 wavelengths of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the levels 2p10 and 5d5 of krypton-86; this length depends on the fundamental constants as the inverse Rydberg constant:

[formula]

(Both "bar" and "krypton" definitions of the metre were used by the SI system in the past.)

In addition, the second can be defined by choosing among different types of clocks other than cesium-133 clock adopted by the SI system; the ammonia clock (a representative of molecular clocks) measures time in terms of molecular vibration frequencies [\cite=coh]:

[formula]

An oscillator placed inside a superconducting cavity forms a high-stability device called a SCSO clock. The frequency of such a device is inversely proportional to the size of the superconductive cavity and therefore to the Bohr radius [\cite=coh]

[formula]

Correspondingly, the "ammonia second" depends on the fundamental constants as

[formula]

while the "SCSO second" has this dependence:

[formula]

Thus the three different definitions of the second are described by

[formula]

where n = 1,2,4 corresponds to the SCSO, ammonia and cesium clock, respectively [\cite=fn].

Similarly, the three different definitions of the centimetre can be combined as

[formula]

with l = 1,2,4 for the bar, krypton and light definitions of unit of length, correspondingly.

From dimensional considerations it follows that an arbitrary system of units, Snl, can be characterized by Eq.([\ref=n]) and ([\ref=l]) with a suitable choice of clock and ruler indices n and l. While theoretically all these Snl systems are equivalent, only a small number of them can be of interest for the past and future high-precision experiments. The nine systems considered in this paper form a representative sample of such realistic systems of units.

Requiring that the centimetre, second and gram do not depend on time, we obtain

[formula]

These can be conveniently rewritten as

[formula]

Thus, if time dependence of α is experimentally measured and units are fixed, there is no further choice on how e,c, depend on time and no extra measurements are required. The results are presented in Table [\ref=tb:clocks&rulers].

How many dimensional constants vary? In all cases except one, at least two constants must vary. These varying constants cannot be set equal to 1 and treated as mere conversion factors. The exceptional case is l = 1,n = 2, i.e. the "bar" ruler plus the ammonia clock. In this case [formula] while e and [formula] stay constant, which allows one to use the system e = 1, [formula] (Hartree units). In other words, in this case e and [formula] can be treated as mere conversion factors.

Is the speed of light constant? For the case of the "light centimetre" (i.e., SI-like definition), c remains constant automatically; however, in general, c varies. Interestingly, for any choice of the centimetre there exists a "matching choice" of the second (i.e., n = l) so that the speed of light remains constant. Furthermore, if we adopt a system with l = n (in such systems c is constant) then it follows that a) both e and [formula] were smaller in the past, and b) the SCSO clock minimizes the time dependence of [formula] and e (because this clock has lower n than other clocks).

In theoretical papers aimed at explaining the α variation in the context of quantum field theory the choice [formula] is frequently made. Consequently, it is implicitely assumed that both [formula] and c do not depend on time. From Eq.(15) and (16) it follows then that the only possible choice for n and l is n = 0 and l = 0, i.e. the system of units must be of S00-type. This system differs from the systems of units used in actual experiments (such as systems in Table 1 - e.g., the SI system is of S44-type). In other words, the theorist's units would appear time-dependent from the point of view of the experimenter (and the other way round). Therefore the translation from one system to the other should be done explicitely in order to make the contact between the theory and observations.

An interesting question is whether or not one can design a high-precision clock with n = 0 or n =  - 1. Such clocks would be useful in removing the time dependence of c and [formula], or c and e respectively.

These results should be taken into account while comparing the predictions of α varying theories and the forthcoming experiments on high-precision clock comparison. Particular attention should be taken to ensure that the theoretical and experimental results are expressed in the same system of units. In the case that experiment finds a discrepancy between the readings of two different clocks, and thus confirms the variability of α, the problem will arise as to which clock shows the "true" time. Our discussion would help in making this choice.

A topic of active debate in recent literature has been whether or not it is meaningful to talk about the time evolution of dimensional fundamental constants. The discussion presented in this paper goes some way in resolving this problem by demonstrating a framework in which time dependence of dimensional constants becomes a well defined concept. Such frameworks require a set of basic assumptions to be fixed (in this particular case, that the units of length, time and mass remain constant.) This can be compared to gauge-dependent quantities and gauge fixing in quantum field theory.

In summary, the time evolution of the three fundamental constants e, [formula] , and c has been studied from a metrological perspective. Assuming that α evolution is known from observation, and the choice of time-independent units is fixed, it has been shown that the three separate evolution laws of e, [formula], and c can be found explicitely for a generic system of units. As an application of these findings, nine specific unit systems of interest for experiment and theory, based on different realistic choices of clocks and rulers, have been considered. Time variations of e, [formula], and c in these nine cases are found and compared, and their significance to the forthcoming experimental tests of α variation are discussed.
