Mesoscopic phase separation in NaxCoO2 (0.65  ≤  x  ≤  0.75)

Introduction

NaxCoO2 has been subject of an intense research activity in the past owing to its possible technological applicabilities as a battery electrode material [\cite=battery]. More recently it has attracted a renewed interest in view of its rich phase diagram and for the several aspects it shares in common with the superconducting cuprates [\cite=Baskaran]. In particular, it has a layered structure formed piling up CoO2 layers containing Co4 + S = 1 / 2 ions [\cite=structure] and it becomes superconducting when the chemical pressure is modified by intercalating water molecules between Na and CoO2 planes [\cite=superc]. On the other hand, while in the cuprates Cu2 + ions form a square lattice, in NaxCoO2 cobalt ions form a triangular lattice which induces geometrical frustration of the antiferromagnetic interactions [\cite=Pelobianco]. Moreover, NaxCoO2, for x around 0.7 shows an anomalous phase transition at Tc≃26 K, evidenced by a small peak in the specific heat. The low-temperature (T) ground state yields an extremely small macroscopic magnetization [\cite=Moto] and it was argued [\cite=muSR], on the basis of μSR measurements, that it might correspond to a spin-density wave (SDW). Furthermore, slightly below room temperature, on the basis of NMR measurements alone, Gavilano et al. Ref.[\cite=Gavilano] suggested that charge ordering occurs. In this T range anomalies in 59Co NMR spectra [\cite=NMRRay] and a crossover from insulating to metallic-like behavior in the c-axes resistivity [\cite=resist] was observed for x≃0.5. Finally, a recent analysis of low-T thermal and transport properties suggested that for x around 0.7 the electronic properties have to be described by a two-band model [\cite=Batlogg].

In the following, based on the analysis of NMR and EPR data, it will be shown that metallic and magnetic insulating domains coexist in NaxCoO2 for 0.65  ≤  x  ≤  0.75. In particular, while EPR is sensitive to the magnetic domains with electrons localized on Co4 + dz2 orbitals, NMR spectra and relaxation measurements allow to investigate the spin dynamics in the metallic regions. The phase separation is argued to occur below T*(x) (220 - 270 K), the same temperature at which Gavilano et al. Ref.[\cite=Gavilano] suggested the occurrence of charge ordering. Above T* the electrons which were localized on Co4 + dz2 orbitals can delocalize through an activated process.

In the next section the experimental results and technical aspects involved in the sample preparation, magnetization, EPR and NMR measurements will be given. The analysis of the EPR and NMR spectra providing evidence for a phase separation will be presented in Sect.III, together with the analysis of the generalized spin susceptibility within the metallic phase. The concluding remarks will be given in Sect. IV.

Experimental results

Sample Preparation

NaxCoO2 (x = 0.65,0.70 and 0.75) samples were prepared following the "rapid heat-up" method [\cite=Bra1] [\cite=Bra2]. A stoichiometric mixture of 99.99% purity Co3O4 and Na2CO3 was thoroughly ground, and placed in a furnace and preheated at 750 C for 12 hours. The obtained samples were reground and annealed for 15 hours at 850 C in air, followed by slow cooling to room temperature. X-ray powder diffraction measurements confirmed all samples to be single phase of hexagonal γ-NaxCoO2 [\cite=Bra3] [\cite=Bra4]. The lattice parameter a was estimated around 2.827 Å   for all samples, while c = 10.939(3),10.907(4) and 10.892(4) Å   for x = 0.65,0.70 and 0.75, respectively, in good agreement with the values reported in literature (see Fig.[\ref=XRD]).

Magnetization

Magnetization measurements were performed using a Quantum Design XPMS-XL7 SQUID magnetometer. The field cooled magnetization (M) for T  ≥  Tc≃26 K was observed to increase linearly with the magnetic field intensity (H). The temperature dependence of the susceptibility χ = M / H, after correcting for the core electrons diamagnetism, for x = 0.65,0.7 and 0.75, is reported in Fig.[\ref=FigchivsT]. One notices that χ increases on cooling and shows a small kink at Tc≃26 K in all samples. The magnitude of χ was observed to increase sizeably upon decreasing x. The susceptibility measurements were repeated on the x = 0.75 sample after 4 months and no ageing effect was noticed, except for a small increase in the low-temperature susceptibility due to possible contamination from paramagnetic impurities.

EPR measurements

EPR spectra were recorded with an X-band spectrometer equipped with a standard microwave cavity and a variable temperature device. The room temperature derivative of the EPR powder spectra for x = 0.65,0.7 and 0.75 is shown in Fig.[\ref=spEPR]. The spectra are broad and slightly asymmetric, with a g≃2, typical of Co4 + ions with a distorted octahedral coordination and a low-spin S = 1 / 2 configuration. One notices a remarkable decrease in the intensity of the EPR signal with increasing Na content. The intensity of the EPR signal was calibrated with respect to the one of a reference paramagnetic salt and it was found that even for x = 0.65 only about 8% of all Co sites contribute to the EPR signal. This reduced intensity at room temperature should not be associated with a poor penetration of the microwave inside the grains. In fact, at room temperature the estimated skin depth is 18 μm, close to the average grain size. Only at low temperature the shortening of the skin depth can lead to a poor irradiation. The low EPR signal originates from a reduced fraction of Co4 + sites. The intensity of the EPR signal (see Fig.[\ref=spEPRvsT]), which in principle is proportional to the contribution to the static uniform susceptibility of the irradiated Co4 + ions, shows an anomalous decrease above T* (≃240K for x = 0.7 and ≃270 K for x = 0.65) and vanishes around 500 K. At low temperature the signal intensity passes through a maximum around 125 K, then decreases and vanishes abruptly at Tc, indicating that at this temperature a transition to a phase with long range order among Co4 + moments occurs. The temperature dependence of the EPR linewidth shows a minimum around 115 K characteristic of two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnets [\cite=Richards] [\cite=MnCl2] (see the inset to Fig.[\ref=spEPR]).

NMR Spectra and relaxation

NMR spectra and spin-lattice relaxation measurements were carried out using standard radio-frequency (RF) pulse sequences. 23Na echo signal was maximized with a π / 2  -  τ  -  π pulse sequence while 59Co echo signal was maximized with a π / 2  -  τ  -  π / 2 sequence. The 23Na (see Fig.[\ref=spna]) and 59Co NMR powder spectra were obtained from the Fourier transform of half of the echo signal and from the envelope of the echo magnitude, respectively.

23Na NMR spectra of the central line, associated with the 1 / 2  -   - 1 / 2 transition, were observed to progressively shift to higher frequency and to broaden on cooling (see Fig.[\ref=shiftNa]). However, the shape of the low-T spectra was not reproducible. Even after a temperature cycle in helium atmosphere, where the sample was warmed from 35 K up to 280 K and after 50 minutes cooled back to 35 K, a change in the spectrum was noticed (see Fig.[\ref=spna]). This evidences that the modifications are not due to ageing effects but rather reflect intrinsic differences in the microscopic environment around the nuclei. In some cases a nearly symmetric line shape was observed whereas in other measurements two distinct peaks were visible [\cite=NMRStall] (see Fig.[\ref=spna]). The two peaks of 23Na central line should not be ascribed to the two singularities expected for a quadrupolar perturbed NMR powder spectrum [\cite=Abragam] since, as will be shown hereafter, the temperature dependence of the spin-lattice relaxation rate measured at the two peaks is different. Also 59Co NMR spectra show analogous modifications after the sample has undergone a temperature cycle between 35 K and room temperature.

It must be mentioned that neither 59Co nor 23Na spectra show any sizeable change when the sample is cooled below Tc. As can be seen in Fig.[\ref=spCoTc] the 59Co NMR spectrum of the central line is practically identical above and below Tc.This is a clear indication that the 59Co nuclei giving rise to the NMR signal, corresponding to the majority of cobalt nuclei, are in regions with no long range magnetic order. It must be mentioned that the observation of 59Co nuclei belonging to Co4 + ions, the ones yielding the EPR signal, is prevented by the extremely fast nuclear relaxation. Hence, EPR and NMR in NaxCoO2 are complementary. The first probes the local susceptibility of Co4 + rich regions which show a long range magnetic order below 26 K, the second allows to investigate the static and dynamic magnetic properties of the metallic regions with non-magnetic cobalt ions.

The paramagnetic shift ΔK of 23Na NMR central line shows the same temperature dependence of χ measured with the SQUID magnetometer. In fact, one can write

[formula]

with A the hyperfine coupling, χ(0,0) the static uniform molar spin susceptibility and δ the chemical shift. Hence, the plot of ΔK vs. χ directly yields the hyperfine coupling (see Fig.[\ref=DKChi]). For x = 0.65 A≃16 kOe, while for x = 0.75 a slightly smaller value A≃14 kOe was found.

Nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate 1 / T1 was measured by using a saturation recovery pulse sequence. The recovery of the nuclear magnetization after saturation of the central line deviates a bit from the expected behavior, namely =  0.1exp( - t / T1)  +  0.9exp( - 6t / T1) for 23Na and =  0.012exp( - t / T1)  +  0.068exp( - 6t / T1)  +  0.206exp( - 15t / T1)  +  0.714exp( - 28t / T1) for 59Co, with m(t) the nuclear magnetization recovered at time t after the saturation sequence. This discrepancy is due to the fact that the different parts of 59Co and 23Na NMR spectra have relaxation rates which differ both in magnitude and also in regards of the temperature dependence. This is evident, for instance, when the recovery of the intensity of the two shoulders of 23Na NMR spectrum in Fig.[\ref=spna] is recorded (see Fig.[\ref=recNa]). One notices a fast relaxing component, associated with the less intense shoulder, and a slow relaxing component due to the most intense peak. The T-dependence of the relaxation rate of the fast relaxing 23Na nuclei shows a small kink at Tc (see the inset to Fig.[\ref=T1Na]) and should be associated with those nuclei close to Co4 + ions. On the other hand, the T-dependence of 1 / T1 due to the slow relaxing nuclei shows a different trend and no peak at Tc. These nuclei are the ones belonging to the metallic regions. Unfortunately, it is possible to discern these two components only at low temperature and only when 23Na NMR spectra shows well defined shoulders. When this separation is not possible, since most of 23Na nuclei are characterized by a slow relaxation rate, the measured 1 / T1 probes essentially the spin excitations of the metallic regions of the sample (see Fig.[\ref=T1Na]). 1 / T1 is observed to increase smoothly with temperature up to about 100 K where a more pronounced increase is observed, followed by an abrupt increase around T*≃220 K for x = 0.75 and around T*≃270 K for x = 0.65, similarly to what was observed by Gavilano et al. Ref.[\cite=Gavilano]. The temperature dependence of 59Co 1 / T1 shows a similar behavior and no anomaly at Tc (see Fig.[\ref=t1alpa]).

Analysis and Discussion

First we will concentrate on the experimental evidences for a phase separation in metallic and in insulating magnetic domains and then we will discuss in more detail the temperature dependence of the static uniform susceptibility probed by NMR shift and magnetization measurements and of the low-frequency dynamics investigated by means of 1 / T1 measurements.

Phase separation

As already mentioned in the previous section the EPR signal is characteristic of Co4 + ions in a low-spin state, with the lowest t2g levels fully occupied and the highest aT1 (corresponding to dz2) orbital half-filled [\cite=Good] [\cite=Baskaran]. The degeneracy among the lowest twofold-degenerate eT and the aT1 levels is relieved by the trigonal distortion around cobalt. Crystal field calculations show that these levels are well separated and hence g≃2 and that a reduced spin-orbit coupling can account for the small anisotropy of the g tensor yielding the slightly asymmetric EPR line (see Fig.[\ref=spEPR]). For T > T* the electrons localized on the aT1 orbital can be promoted to the conduction band formed by the hybridization of Co4 + eT and O 2p orbitals, through an activated process. This leads to an activated transport along the c-axes [\cite=resist] and to a polaronic-like motion of the electrons, as pointed out by Rivadulla et al. Ref.[\cite=Good]. When the electrons are promoted to the conduction band the number of Co4 + sites is progressively reduced, the intensity of the EPR signal diminshes with temperature (see Fig.[\ref=spEPR]) and, finally, for T  >  500 K the majority of the electrons are itinerant. Hence, one can derive the T-dependence of Co4 + sites density directly from the EPR data.

In order to estimate the number of Co4 + sites one has first to take into account that the EPR signal intensity depends on the T-dependent static uniform susceptibility and on the microwave screening, which is relevant at low-T. The T-dependence of the spin susceptibility was assumed to be the one of a 2D triangular antiferromagnet [\cite=ChiTALAF], with a Curie-Weiss temperature Θ≃135 K. This value is suggested by the minimum in the T-dependence of the EPR linewidth, which usually occurs at a temperature slightly below Θ [\cite=Richards] [\cite=MnCl2]. The maximum in the T-dependence of the EPR intensity around 125 K is not the one characteristic of the susceptibility of a 2D triangular antiferromagnet, which should occur around 0.35Θ≃47 K (see the dotted line in Fig.[\ref=spEPRvsT]). Also the decrease of the EPR intensity below 100 K is too fast to originate from the T dependence of the susceptibility of a 2D triangular antiferromagnet. In fact, the pronounced reduction of the low-T EPR intensity results from the decrease of the skin-depth d with temperature, which is proportional to the square-root of the electrical resistivity. In order to take into account this effect we have assumed for simplicity spherical grains, with an average radius of 30 μm, and that a grain is fully irradiated over a distance equal to d (18 μm at room temperature). Taking into account the T-dependence of NaxCoO2 resistivity reported in literature we have derived the curve shown in Fig.[\ref=spEPRvsT] for the expected integrated EPR intensity. The experimental data are observed to follow rather well the expected behavior below T*, pointing out that for T  ≤  T* the density of Co4 + sites is T-independent. The reduction of the EPR intensity above T*, with respect to the estimated one allows to derive the temperature evolution of the fraction of electrons localized on Co4 + aT1 orbitals (see Fig.[\ref=fracCo]). If Δ is the energy difference between the aT1 level and the conduction band, the statistical population of Co4 + ions should be given roughly by nCo4 +(T) / nCo4 +(T  ≪  T*) = 1 / (1 + Neffexp( - Δ / T)), with Neff an effective density of states for the itinerant electrons. Although the data in Fig.[\ref=fracCo] can be fitted rather well for a value of Δ≃0.3 eV a more quantitative estimate would require the knowledge of the T-dependence of Δ and therefore this value should be taken just as an order of magnitude.

The observation of an EPR signal below T* suggests that, although the electrical resistivity has a metallic behavior [\cite=Batlogg], there is still a sizeable fraction of electrons localized on Co4 + aT1 orbitals at low T and, hence, T* cannot signal a conventional metal to insulator transition [\cite=Good]. The absolute value of the fraction of Co4 + sites for T  ≪  T*, estimated from the EPR measurements, is around 8% for x = 0.65 and progressively decreases upon increasing the Na content. This trend is exactly the one of the magnetic entropy estimated from specific heat measurements carried out on samples of the same batch [\cite=Feher] (see Fig.[\ref=entropy]). In particular, the x dependence of the intensity of the specific heat peak at Tc scales with the EPR intensity upon increasing x (see the inset to Fig.[\ref=entropy]). Moreover, the magnitude of the magnetic entropy [\cite=Feher] also indicates that for x = 0.65 a fraction around 8% of S = 1 / 2 ions contribute to the total entropy. This is a neat confirmation that the magnetic transition yielding the specific heat peak at 26 K is due to the ordering of localized Co4 + magnetic moments. Also μSR measurements suggest that only a small fraction of the sample becomes magnetic. In fact, Sugiyama et al. Ref.[\cite=muSR] observed that for x = 0.75 no more than 20 % of the muons injected in the sample go into (or close to) magnetically ordered regions for T  ≤  Tc. This is not by itself an indication of a SDW phase since in that case, although one might expect a reduced value of the sample magnetization, all the sample should show a long-range order.

On the other hand, 59Co NMR relaxation measurements and spectra, due to cobalt nuclei in metallic regions, show no sign of magnetic ordering. These observations clearly point towards a phase separation between antiferromagnetic insulating and metallic regions for T < T*. Above T* no phase separation occurs and the electrons which for T < T* were localized on the aT1 orbital can move with a polaronic-like motion through all the sample [\cite=Good].

The difference in the NMR spectra after temperature cycling above T* can be due to a different topological arrangement of the insulating and metallic domains. In the case of 23Na NMR spectra, the fast relaxing nuclei yielding the high frequency shoulder (see Fig.[\ref=spna])) are the ones closer to Co4 + ions, while the most intense peak should be associated with 23Na nuclei well inside the metallic regions. Since no effect of thermal cycles was noticed on the intensity of the EPR signal the ratio of the insulating over metallic volume should not change after the temperature cycles. Then, a different ratio in the intensity of the two components of 23Na NMR spectra should originate from a modification in the surface/volume ratio of the insulating regions. An increase in the intensity of the high frequency shoulder should be caused by an average decrease in the size of the insulating domains and vice-versa. Now, why the topology of the metallic and insulating domains should be affected by the temperature cycles? One possibility is that at high temperatures, due to their relatively high mobility, Na+ ions modify their arrangement and lead to a modification in the Coulomb potential. In particular, one should expect that the metallic domains are attracted by Na+ ionic potential, while the Co4 + rich insulating domains are repulsed.

A lower boundary for the size L of the magnetic domains can be estimated by taking into account that Tc is x-independent and, therefore, is not affected by finite size effects. Then at Tc the in-plane magnetic correlation length ξCo4 +(Tc)  ≪  L. By taking for ξCo4 +(T) the T-dependence expected for a 2D triangular antiferromagnet and the in-plane exchange coupling J = 2Θ / 3≃90 K, one finds [\cite=ChiTALAF] that at Tc the correlation length is less than 3 lattice steps. ξCo4 +(Tc) can be estimated also by taking a mean field expression for [formula], with [formula] [\cite=resist] the interplanar exchange coupling among Co4 + magnetic moments. One finds ξCo4 +(Tc)≃5.4 lattice steps. Hence, it must be concluded that L  ≫  6 lattice steps. Although an upper estimate for L cannot be made it must be remarked that one can conclude that the phase separation is not macroscopic, i.e. due to chemical inhomogeneities, but mesoscopic. First of all, it would be rather singular that all data reported in literature on NaxCoO2 samples prepared in different ways indicate the same Tc and a similar magnitude of specific heat peaks [\cite=Moto] [\cite=Batlogg]. Second, if the insulating magnetic domains where macroscopic the EPR signal intensity should not suffer from microwave irradiation problems. Third, the intensity of 23Na and 59Co NMR spectra should not be affected by thermal cycles if the separation was macroscopic.

Finally, it is important to observe that the phase separation is already present at T  ≫  J. This clearly indicates that the antiferromagnetic coupling among Co4 + ions cannot be the driving force for this phase separation and that alternative explanations should be envisaged [\cite=Grilli].

Spin dynamics in the metallic domains

The magnetization and NMR data allow to probe the static and dynamic magnetic properties of the metallic regions which do not undergo a phase transition. The total static uniform susceptibility measured with the SQUID is the sum of two terms χ  =  χCo4 +  +  χNFL, the first due to the magnetic domains and the second due to the metallic ones. One notices (see Fig.[\ref=FigchivsT]) that χCo4 + is rather small and can account just for the small shift in the high T absolute value of χ(x), but not for the sizeable increase on cooling. In fact, also in the x = 0.75 sample, where χCo4 + is negligible, an increase of χ upon cooling is observed. This increase indicates that strong correlations among the electrons are present and that the metallic regions cannot be treated as a weakly correlated Fermi liquid. Also specific heat C measurements show a low temperature upturn in C / T    [\cite=Batlogg] characteristic of 2D electron systems with antiferromagnetic correlations [\cite=vonL]. Following Moriya et al. Ref.[\cite=Moriya] one would expect a high-T Curie-Weiss behavior both for the uniform static susceptibility χ(0,0) and in 1 / T1T. However, if one plots 1 / χ(0,0) vs. T, with χ(0,0) the one measured with the SQUID one observes a non-linear behavior (see Fig.[\ref=chialpa]). We remark that here there is no sense in subtracting a T-independent Pauli-like contribution since the electrons are strongly correlated. Also if one plots the inverse of the spin contribution to 23Na NMR shift ΔK = Aχ(0,0) / gμBNA one observes a non-linear temperature dependence. Therefore, one has to resort to a form of the generalized spin susceptibility which can describe the non-Fermi-liquid (NFL) behavior. Recently, based on inelastic neutron scattering results, combined with heuristic arguments a response function of two-dimensional (2D) character has been used to describe the NFL behavior in the proximity of a quantum critical point [\cite=uno] [\cite=due]:

[formula]

with an anomalous exponent α  ≠  1, (ω / T) scaling and renormalized Curie-Weiss constant c. [formula] (with [formula] starting from the critical wavevector [formula]), [formula] the critical frequency and [formula] the correlation length. In particular a value α≃0.7 was observed to justify the behavior of CeCu5.9Au0.1 generalized susceptibility [\cite=uno] [\cite=tre]. In the light of these findings one can resort to the above form of [formula] to analyze magnetization and 1 / T1 results. From Eq.[\ref=eq:1] one finds that

[formula]

Then, for a certain value of α by plotting 1 / χ(0,0) vs. Tα one should observe a linear behavior. Remarkably this was observed to occur for α = 0.7 (see Fig.[\ref=chialpa]), as in CeCu5.9Au0.1 [\cite=vonL]. The values derived for Θ' for the different Na contents are close to 75 K.

Now we turn to the discussion of the spin-lattice relaxation rate. Below T* one observes a drastic decrease in the amplitude of 1 / T1. In particular, 1 / T1T decreases down to about 100 K and then starts to increase again, as expected for a NFL. 1 / T1 was found to be field independent up to T*   [\cite=Gavilano], therefore, the drastic decrease below T* does not indicate a slowing down of the fluctuations to frequencies below nuclear Larmor frequency ωL but either a decrease in the amplitude of the spin fluctuations or a drastic increase in the frequency of the fluctuations. This can be expected in correspondence of a crossover from a high temperature rather slow dynamics probed by 1 / T1, associated with polaronic-like motions of the electrons, to a low-T fast dynamics of the itinerant electrons. Below 100 K the behavior is the one expected for a NFL and one can verify if, by using the form of [formula] reported above and α = 0.7, the T-dependence of 1 / T1 is reproduced. From Eq.[\ref=eq:1], by recalling that [\cite=Moro]

[formula]

with γ the nuclear gyromagnetic ratio, under the condition that all the excitation frequencies [formula] remain larger than ωL and in case of an external field H <  < kBT / gμB, one derives

[formula]

All constants involved in Eq.[\ref=eq:4], except [formula] (entering ξ(T) expression) and a, have been previously determined through the analysis of the NMR shift and of the static uniform spin susceptibility. One observes (see Fig.[\ref=t1alpa]) that the T-dependence of 1 / T1 can be reproduced reasonably well for α = 0.7 by taking a value of a such that [formula] s- 1 and ξ(T = 10K)≃9 lattice steps, for x = 0.75, and [formula] s- 1 and for ξ(T = 10K)≃11 lattice steps, for x = 0.65.

Conclusions

It was shown through a series of EPR, NMR and magnetization measurements that in NaxCoO2 for 0.65  ≤  x  ≤  0.75 phase separation in metallic and in magnetic domains is present. The phase separation develops below T*  ≫  J and therefore, it is unlikely that the antiferromagnetic exchange is the driving mechanism for the phase separation. Above T* the activated delocalization of the electrons yields a marked reduction in the EPR amplitude. The spin excitations in the metallic regions are suitably described by an heuristic form of the susceptibility successfully used to describe the properties of strongly correlated metals. All the above observations are relevant in regards of the phase separation observed in the cuprates since they share many aspects in common with NaxCoO2. However, a deep comparison of the two systems goes beyond the aim of this work. Here we only mention that while the strong antiferromagnetic coupling in the cuprates can be relevant for the phase separation or for stripes formation [\cite=Tranqu], in NaxCoO2 it is not. On the other hand, it is interesting to observe that in both systems phase separation is stabilized for those doping levels x yielding a charge distribution which is commensurate with the lattice, namely x≃2 / 3 for the 2D triangular lattice of NaxCoO2 and x = 1 / 8 for the 2D square lattice of the cuprates [\cite=Tranqu].
