Abstract: Let H and K be finite dimensional Hilbert spaces, T:B(H)  →  B(K) be a coarse-graining and D1, D2 be density matrices on H. In this paper the consequences of the existence of a coarse-graining β:B(K)  →  B(H) satisfying βT(Ds) = Ds are given. (This means that T is sufficient for D1 and D2.) It is shown that [formula] (s = 1,2) should hold with pairwise orthogonal summands and with commuting factors and with some probability distributions λs(p) for 1  ≤  p  ≤  r (s = 1,2). This decomposition allows to deduce the exact condition for equality in the strong subaddivity of the von Neumann entropy.

Introduction

Let H and K be finite dimensional Hilbert spaces and let T:B(H)  →  B(K) be a trace-preserving completely positive (or at least 2-positive) mapping. The mapping T sends density matrices acting on H into density matrices acting on K. Such a mapping is called channeling transformation in quantum information theory, if H  =  K, then T may describe the dynamical change of state. We use the term coarse-graining, because the statistical aspects get emphasis. Let D1 be a density of a quantum state on H. Then the coarse-grained density T(D1) contains less information about the original quantum state and provides a partial knowledge of D1. The statistical inference is manifested by a mapping β:B(K)  →  B(H) and in the good case βT(D1) = D1 and the original state is recovered.

In this paper, we study the scenario, where two states, density matrices D1 and D2, are given and we want to distinguish between them. If this is not more difficult than distinguishing between T(D1) and T(D2), then the coarse-graining is called sufficient for this pair. Formally we say that T is sufficient for D1 and D2 if there exists a trace preserving 2-positive mapping β:B(K)  →  B(H) such that

[formula]

This β plays the role of recovery and it is not at all unique. Early references concerning sufficiency in this quantum mechanical setting are [\cite=petz1988] [\cite=petz1989] and our general reference is Chap. 9 of [\cite=OP]. (In classical mathematical statistics sufficiency is a standard subject included in most books, our terminology is close to [\cite=Strasser].)

Algebraicly β in ([\ref=E:M]) is the left inverse of T as far as the densities D1 and D2 are concerned. It is easy to give an example where such a β exists. If T is implemented by a unitary U:H  →  K, then β can be implemented by U*:K  →  H. This is a trivial situation. It is a bit less trivial that β exists also in the case when D1 = D2.

The aim of this paper is to characterize the situation when the above β exists. Actually, this was done a long time ago. It was proved in [\cite=petz1988] (see also [\cite=mon2]) that β exists if and only if

[formula]

for all real t, where T* is the standard transpose of T. Although this is a necessary and sufficient condition, it is not completely satisfactory, since it does not give any hint about the interrelation of T, D1 and D2.

The main result of the present paper is to show that ([\ref=E:ns]) implies the decomposition

[formula]

where [formula] commutes with [formula], there are pairwise orthogonal projections qp such that [formula] and [formula] are supported in qp for all 1  ≤  p  ≤  r and λs(p) are some probability distributions (s = 1,2). The point is that the second factor is the same for s = 1 and for s = 2.

Since the complete positivity of T is not assumed, the Stinespring dilation cannot be used. For this reason and also due to the algebraic methods, our approach is different from [\cite=koashi], where the conditions T(D1) = D1 and T(D2) = D2 are studied and variety of physical motivations is given.

We apply our structure theorem to deduce a sufficient and necessary condition for the equality case in the strong subadditivity of quantum entropy and obtain the result of [\cite=HJPW] as an application.

In the whole paper, an algebraic approach is followed.

Preliminaries

Let H and K be finite dimensional Hilbert spaces. Recall that 2-positivity of τ:B(H)  →  B(K) means that

[formula]

It is well-known that a 2-positive unit-preserving mapping τ satisfies the Schwarz inequality τ(A*A)  ≥  τ(A)*τ(A).

The most important 2-positive mappings are of the form

[formula]

with some linear operators Li:H  →  K. (This is the Kraus representation of the completely positive maps.) We call Li operator coefficients.

In this paper T always denotes a trace-preserving 2-positive mapping T:B(H)  →  B(K) and we assume that the density matrices D1,D2,T(D1) and T(D2) are all invertible. If T admits a Kraus representation, then the operator coefficients satisfy [formula]. Lots of applications of such mappings are given in [\cite=N-Ch] in the setting of quantum information theory.

The spaces B(H) and B(K) are Hilbert spaces when they are endowed with the standard Hilbert-Schmidt inner product

[formula]

For a trace-preserving 2-positive mapping T:B(H)  →  B(K), its adjoint T* is a unital 2-positive mapping. It follows that T*:B(K)  →  B(H) satisfies the Schwarz inequality.

The spaces B(H) and B(K) admit also the inner products

[formula]

and

[formula]

The dual α of T* with respect to these inner products is 2-positive and unital, and it is characterized by the properties

[formula]

It is easy to give α concretely:

[formula]

It is seen from this formula that if T has operator coefficients Li, then the operator coefficients of α are T(D1)- 1 / 2LiD1 / 21.

Note that if T* is an embedding, then α is the generalized conditional expectation introduced in [\cite=AC], see [\cite=PD1984] for generalizations and for a systematic study. This kind of dual was called transpose in [\cite=OP] and makes appearance in several places, for example in connection with the best quantum recovery map [\cite=BaK], or in the theory of Connes-Narnhofer-Thirring dynamical entropy [\cite=OP].

The standard dual T#:B(K)  →  B(H) of α is trace preserving. The next few lines follow simply from the definition of T# and the concrete form of the above inner products:

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

Observe that T#(T(D1)) = D1.

In the analysis of condition ([\ref=E:M]) we first establish that the existence of β implies that from the set of all possible β's satisfying ([\ref=E:M]) we can choose one canonically, namely T#. Remember that the definition of T# depends on the density D1, although this dependence is not included in the notation.

Assume now the existence of β for ([\ref=E:M]). According to Theorem 2 in [\cite=mon2] we have ([\ref=E:ns]) for all real t. Under our hypothesis [formula] and [formula] are unitaries and condition ([\ref=E:ns]) tells us that ut∈AT* for every [formula], see Lemma [\ref=L:2] below for AT* and its properties. Consequently, T*(utY) = T*(ut)T*(Y) and by analytic continuation we have

[formula]

which implies

[formula]

Therefore the relation T#(T(D2)) = D2 can be concluded and in this way the following has been shown in [\cite=petz1988].

If there exists a trace preserving 2-positive mapping β:B(K)  →  B(H) such that βT(D1) = D1 and βT(D2) = D2, then T#T(D1) = D1 and T#T(D2) = D2.

Consider now the 2-positive unital mapping [formula]. If Li are the operator coefficients of T, then [formula] has coefficients L*jT(D1)- 1 / 2LiD1 / 21. Let [formula] be the set of its fixed points. Since [formula] leaves the states corresponding to D1 and D2 invariant, the mean ergodic theorem applies and tells us the existence of conditional expectation E from B(H) to [formula] which commutes with [formula] and has the property E*(Ds) = Ds (s = 1,2). Takesaki's theorem ([\cite=Stra] [\cite=Tak], cf. Theorem 4.5 in [\cite=OP]) tells us that

[formula]

(In another formulation, [formula] is stable under the modular groups, see Chapter 4 of [\cite=OP] for a concise overview of the modular theory.)

Structure of certain unitaries

In order to understand condition ([\ref=E:stab]), we analyze the relation

[formula]

for a unitary u and for a subalgebra A of B(H). The result is formulated in the propositions below. We shall use the emerging structure in the next section but the result is interesting in itself.

Since A is finite dimensional, it is isomorphic to a direct sum of full matrix algebras, so in an appropriate basis, elements of A have a blockdiagonal form

[formula]

where m denotes the multiplicity and d the dimension of the block A(m,d,i).

For example, if there are three different blocks with multiplicity two, two of them with dimension two and one of them with dimension three, and another block with multiplicity four and dimension one, then K(2,2) = 2,K(2,3) = 1,K(4,1) = 1 and every element A∈A has the form

[formula]

with B1,B2∈M2, C∈M3 and [formula].

Let Pm,d be the projection in A corresponding to multiplicity m and dimension d, that is

[formula]

where Id is the d  ×  d identity matrix, and let

[formula]

be the projection corresponding to the multiplicity m. We denote by Hm the range of Pm. Note that Pm,d and hence Pm commutes with elements of A, so

[formula]

are unital algebras with unit Pm,d and Pm, respectively.

We fix an orthonormal basis

[formula]

in the range of Pm,d for every possible m and d, such that [formula].

Let u be a unitary in B(H) such that the map A  ↦  u*Au leaves A invariant. Then u commutes with Pm for every multiplicity m.

Proof. The statement is trivial when only one multiplicity exists, and we apply mathematical induction in the number of multiplicities.

Note that the rank of any minimal projection in PmA is m. Let m1 denote the smallest multiplicity, and let q∈Pm1A be a minimal projection, then q is of rank m1. Pmu*qu is a projection again and its rank is at most m1. Since all non-zero projections in PmA has rank at least m, we can conclude that Pmu*qu = 0 if m > m1. Every element of Pm1A is a linear combination of the above q's, hence we have Pmu*au = 0 if m > m1 and a∈Pm1A.

Since [formula] for every possible d,k, it follows that

[formula]

if m > m1. So we can conclude that u*e(m1,d,k)∈Hm1 which gives that both Hm1 and its orthogonal complement are invariant subspaces for u, that is, Pm1u = uPm1. Now we can restrict the whole problem to the orthogonal complement of Hm1 and use induction hypothesis in the number of multiplicities. [formula]

We have obtained that u has a blockdiagonal structure [formula], and to explore the finer structure of u, we can restrict our attention to the case when all the multiplicities are the same number m, i.e. the elements of A have the form

[formula]

As before, we can define projections Pd,i (1  ≤  i  ≤  K(d)) by the formula

[formula]

and the projection corresponding to dimension d is

[formula]

Again, all these projections commute with all elements of A.

In the above setting u commutes with Pd for every dimension d, and so u has the blockdiagonal structure

[formula]

Proof. Since A is isomorphic to [formula], then u induces an automorphism γ of M. The inclusion matrix of γ is a permutation matrix corresponding to a permutation τ of the set of all possible pairs (d,i) such that

[formula]

This implies that

[formula]

which, by the same argument as in Proposition [\ref=mult] implies the desired statement. [formula]

In the view of the above Propositions we can suppose that all the blocks in A have the same multiplicity m and the same dimension d, consequently A is isomorphic to [formula]. In this case dim(H) = mdK, and B is isomorphic to [formula]. Elements of A have the form

[formula]

where Ai is an element of Md and {Eij:1  ≤  i,j  ≤  K} are the standard matrix units of MK. It is easily seen that in this representation u has the form

[formula]

where σ is a permutation of the set [formula], and the ui 's are easily seen to be unitary elements of [formula] that leave the subalgebra [formula] invariant.

The final step to describe the structure of a possible unitary [formula] such that u leaves the subalgebra [formula] invariant. Since u induces an automorphism of [formula], we have a unitary v such that

[formula]

The automorphism [formula] leaves the subalgebra fixed and is induced by a unitary [formula]. Hence W must be in the commutant of the subalgebra, that is, [formula]. From this we conclude that [formula].

We arrived at the following:

In the case when all the multiplicities and all the dimensions are the same, u must be of the form

[formula]

where vi∈Md and wi∈Mm are unitaries and σ is a permutation of the set [formula].

Note that u  ↦  σ is a homomorphism on the group of allowed u's (while [formula] is not).

The general situation is put together from the above propositions: u commutes with Pm,d and uPm,d is described by Proposition [\ref=P:3].

Sufficient coarse-grainings

Let T:B(H)  →  B(K) be a trace-preserving 2-positive mapping and Dt be density matrices on H (t = 1,2). We assume the existence of a trace preserving 2-positive mapping β:B(K)  →  B(H) such that [formula] and [formula]. In other words, we suppose that T is sufficient for D1 and D2. Our goal is to describe the structure coming from this assumption.

In this section we work with positive unital mappings, so are the adjoint T*:B(K)  →  B(H) and α:B(H)  →  B(K) defined by ([\ref=E:alfa]). Let the fixed point algebra of [formula] be [formula], that of [formula] be [formula]. The mapping [formula] leaves the state corresponding to D1 invariant: [formula] follows by easy computation. [formula] was shown in the equivalent form T#(T(D2)) = D2 in ([\ref=E:4]). Similarly, [formula] and [formula].

Let

[formula]

and

[formula]

Then [formula] and [formula]. Moreover, T* restricted to [formula] is an algebraic isomomorphism onto [formula] with inverse α and

[formula]

for all A∈Aå and B∈B(H).

The lemma is stated for reference, concerning the proof see 9.1 in [\cite=Stra].

We have [formula] and to the unitaries [formula] we can apply the arguments in the previous section. [formula] has the form of ([\ref=E:A-forma]) and we have the central projections Pm,d of [formula] at our disposal. As above elements of [formula] have the form

[formula]

where Xi is an element of Mj and {Eij:1  ≤  i,j  ≤  k} are the standard matrix units of Mk. We can imagine Pm,dB(K)Pm,d in the form [formula].

According to Proposition [\ref=P:3] every unitary [formula] is of the form

[formula]

where vi∈Mj and wi∈Mm are unitaries and σ is a permutation of the set [formula], all of them depend on the real parameter t. Since this dependence is obviously continuous, the only possibility is σ  =   identity. It follows that

[formula]

Similar argument applies to T(D2) and we have

[formula]

If we want both factors to be normalized, then positive coefficients should be included in the front.

We refer to Theorem 9.11 from [\cite=OP], this tells that [formula] belongs to [formula]. Therefore

[formula]

We want to see the densities T(D1) and T(D2) in the central decomposition of the algebra [formula]. Assume that [formula] the minimal central projections in [formula]. Then [formula] is isomorphic to a full matrix algebra Mnp and [formula] is isomorphic to [formula]. In the above decomposition of T(D1) we have

[formula]

where the first factor belongs to a central summand [formula] and the second one is in [formula]. Hence we arrived at the following structure.

Let T:B(H)  →  B(K) be a trace-preserving 2-positive mapping which is sufficient for the invertible density matrices Ds on H (s = 1,2). Assume that T(D1) and T(D2) are invertible as well. Then there exists a subalgebra [formula] with minimal central projections [formula] such that

T*(XY) = T*(X)T*(Y) for X∈B(K) and [formula].

[formula] for some density operators [formula] and [formula] and for probability distributions λs(p) (1  ≤  p  ≤  r) for s = 1,2.

The theorem is formulated in the Hilbert space K but similar formulation is possible in H as well. One starts with the observation [formula]. qp: = T*(zp) are the minimal central projections in [formula]. [formula] for some [formula] (1  ≤  p  ≤  r). Property ([\ref=E:alfaprop]) is reformulated for the standard dual T# as

[formula]

and we have

[formula]

therefore

[formula]

where the support of [formula] is in qp and T#(R(p)) commutes with [formula] for all p.

We first note that the structure formulated in the theorem is derived from the sufficiency condition but on the other hand that structure implies sufficiency. Namely, the structure above guarantees condition ([\ref=E:ns]) by a simple calculation.

[formula]

Our theorem extends the result in [\cite=koashi] whose setting corresponds to the case H  =  K and D1 = D2 in our notation and the decomposition

[formula]

comes out.

Our theorem extends obviously to more density matrices. If T is sufficient for [formula], then all density matrices have the above form and in each summand the first factor depends on 1  ≤  s  ≤  k while the second does not.

Strong subadditivity of entropy

The strong subadditivity of entropy is

[formula]

for a system [formula], where DB,DAB,DBC are the reduced densities of the state DABS of the composite system and S stands for the von Neumann entropy [\cite=SSA]. We have the equivalent form

[formula]

in terms of relative entropy [\cite=OP], τ denotes the density of the tracial state (for example, τB is IB  /   dim HB). This inequality is equivalent to the inequality

[formula]

which, on the other hand, is the consequence of the monotonicity of relative entropy. Uhlmann's theorem should be applied to the partial trace

[formula]

since

[formula]

To use our previous notation we set [formula], [formula], [formula] and D2: = DABC. Our aim is to study the case of equality in ([\ref=E:T]) which is known to be equivalent of the sufficiency of T with respect to D1 and D2 (see [\cite=petz1988] and [\cite=mon2]).

We recall that [formula] is the fixed point algebra of the mapping

[formula]

It is clear that [formula], therefore

[formula]

and [formula] must be of the form [formula] with a subalgebra AB of B(HB). Elements of AB have the form ([\ref=E:A-forma]) and

[formula]

where the (central) projection Pm,d corresponds to multiplicity m and dimension d.

The algebra Pm,dABPm,d is isomorphic to [formula]. In this case dim Pm,d = mdK and elements of Pm,dABPm,d have the form

[formula]

where Bi is an element of Md, {Eij:1  ≤  i,j  ≤  K(m,d)} are the standard matrix units of MK(m,d) and Im∈Mm is the identity. We use these facts to pass to the algebra [formula]. [formula] is a central projection and elements of [formula] are of the form

[formula]

Since the unitaries [formula] commute with P'm,d we have

[formula]

and this allows us to establish the structure of D2P'(m,j).

[formula]

where DAB1(i) and DB2C(i) are density matrices in [formula] and [formula], respectively. We can conclude the form of DABC which allows equality in the strong subadditivity for the entropy:

[formula]

where [formula] is pairwise orthogonal family of projections acting on HB. This structure is the same as the one obtained in [\cite=HJPW].

It has been known for a while that the equality in several strong subaddtivity inequalities for the von Neumann entropy of the local restriction of states of infinite product chains is equivalent to the Markov property initiated by Accardi (see Proposition 11.5 in [\cite=OP] or [\cite=petz1994]). Therefore, from the structure ([\ref=E:SSA]), one can deduce the form of quantum Markov states which was done in [\cite=AL] [\cite=Ohno] by different methods, see these papers concerning the details.
