Minimal threefolds of small slope and the Noether inequality for canonically polarized threefolds

Lemma Corollary Proposition Claim Definition Question Example Conjecture Remark

Introduction

We work over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic 0.

On an irreducible complete curve C (may be singular), one has deg (KC)  ≥  2g(C) - 2 where g(C) is the geometric genus of C.

This inequality has a 2-dimensional analogue which is the famous "Noether's inequality" (see [\cite=N]). Explicitly, on a minimal surface S (with RDP singularities) of general type, one has

[formula]

where pg(S): = h0(S,KS) is the geometric genus of S. Together with the Bogomolov-Miyaoka-Yau inequality (cf. [\cite=M], [\cite=Y]): K2S  ≤  9χ(OS), they have ever played very important roles in surface theory (for instance the surface geography: see [\cite=Cat], [\cite=C1], [\cite=C2], [\cite=Per] and [\cite=X] etc.).

The importance of the Noether inequality in mind, Miles Reid first asked the question seeking for a 3-dimensional analogue in early 1980's. Since then, there have been many papers which give effective Noether type of inequalities either in the form K3  ≥  aχ + b (see [\cite=O] and [\cite=Ba2] etc.) or for restricted objects (see [\cite=Kob] and [\cite=CM] etc.). We mention here that an effective linear inequality in terms of χ seems to be impossible because χ could be both positive and negative for a general 3-fold of general type. It is Kobayashi's interesting examples ([\cite=Kob]) that shows the naive inequality K3  ≥  2pg - 6 (in 3-dimensional case) is not correct in general. Thus it becomes more interesting what the 3-dimensional Noether inequality is even under very restricted conditions. Such a "Noether inequality" is by all means important to the 3-fold geography (see [\cite=H]).

The aim of this paper is to present a Noether inequality for canonically polarized threefolds and to give a classification to arbitrary minimal 3-folds of general type with small slope. Our main results are as follows.

Let X be a smooth projective threefold with ample canonical divisor KX. Then

[formula]

Let X be a minimal projective Gorenstein 3-fold of general type with canonical singularities. Assume

[formula]

Then X is fibred by curves of genus 2.

Let X be a projective minimal 3-fold with only canonical singularities. Assume

[formula]

(and [formula]). Then X must be fibred by curves of genus 2.

Further classifications to restricted minimal 3-folds are presented as an interesting application.

Let X be a smooth projective 3-fold with ample KX. Assume

[formula]

Then X must be canonically fibred by curves of genus 2.

Theorem [\ref=T1] is sharp according to M. Kobayashi's interesting examples ([\cite=Kob]) which say that there are canonically polarized 3-folds with infinite number of configurations of invariants (K3,pg) satisfying the equality: [formula]. Again due to Kobayashi's examples, Theorem [\ref=T1.5] and Theorem [\ref=T2] are not empty and they are parallel to surface case (see [\cite=Reid] and [\cite=Xiao]). We do not know, however, whether both are optimal.

Based on our previous paper ([\cite=CM]), and in order to prove Theorem [\ref=T1], we need to treat the most difficult case, i.e. when X is canonically fibred by surfaces of general type with (c21,pg) = (1,2), through new methods. The new observation of this paper is that we may choose a special embedded resolution to the given polarized 3-fold and then successfully apply the Kawamata-Viehweg vanishing theorem to [formula]-divisors on both 3-folds and surfaces to estimate the dimension of those cohomological groups in question. We bound the K3X from below by studying the bicanonical system rather than in the traditional way.

This note was written while I was visiting the Institute of Mathematical Sciences, the Chinese University of Hong Kong. I would like to thank Eckart Viehweg for his patient explaining my frequent email queries. Thanks are also due to Kang Zuo for effective discussions and for his hospitality. Finally I appreciate many helps from both Keiji Oguiso and Seunghun Lee.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=T1] and Theorem [\ref=T1.5]

In this section, We work on minimal 3-folds of canonical index 1. According to the Mori minimal model theory ([\cite=KMM], [\cite=K-M] and [\cite=R1] etc.), one may take X to be a minimal projective threefold with invertible canonical sheaf ωX  =  OX(KX) and with locally factorial terminal singularities. From the expression of the inequality in Theorem [\ref=T1]. One may assume pg(X)  ≥  3.

We study the canonical map φ1 which is usually a rational map. Take the birational modification π:X'  →  X, according to Hironaka, such that

(i) X' is smooth;

(ii) the movable part of |KX'| is basepoint free.

(iii) π*(KX) is linearly equivalent to a divisor supported by a divisor of normal crossings.

Denote by g the composition [formula]. So [formula] is a morphism. Let [formula] be the Stein factorization of g. We have the following commutative diagram:

[formula]

We may write

[formula]

where M is the movable part of |KX'|, [formula] the fixed part and [formula] an effective divisor which is a sum of distinct exceptional divisors. Throughout we always mean π*(KX) by [formula]. So, whenever we take the round up of απ*(KX), we always have [formula] for all positive rational number α. We may also write

[formula]

where [formula] is actually an effective divisor.

If dim φ1(X) = 2, we see that a general fiber of f is a smooth projective curve of genus g  ≥  2. We say that X is canonically fibred by curves of genus g.

If dim φ1(X) = 1, we see that a general fiber S of f is a smooth projective surface of general type. We say that X is canonically fibred by surfaces with invariants (c21(S0),pg(S)), where S0 is the minimal model of S.

One has already the inequality

[formula]

according to Kobyashi ([\cite=Kob]) even for a general minimal 3-fold of general type.

For reader's convenience, we reformulate our known results in [\cite=CM] in the case dim (B)  ≤  2.

(Theorem 4.1 of [\cite=CM]) Let X be a minimal projective Gorenstein 3-fold of general type with only locally factorial terminal singularities. Then we have

(i) If dim φ1(X) = 2, i.e., X is canonically fibred by curves of genus g, then

[formula]

(ii) If dim φ1(X) = 1, then either K3X  ≥  2pg(X) - 4 or (K2S0,pg(S)) = (1,2).

(Theorem 4.3 of [\cite=CM]) Let X be a minimal projective smooth 3-fold of general type. Suppose dim φ1(X) = 2 and X is canonically fibred by curves of genus 2. Then

[formula]

The inequality is sharp.

We are left to study the only case when dim (B) = 1 and X is canonically fibred by surfaces with (c21,pg) = (1,2). For this purpose, we need a little bit of preparation.

For the technical reason, we must assume that KX is ample from now on. The inequality in Theorem [\ref=T1] is trivial for small value of pg(X). One may assume pg(X)  ≥  3. Furthermore, we assume dim (B) = 1 and that a general fiber of the induced fibration f:X'  →  B is a surface with (c21,pg) = (1,2). Set b: = g(B) the geometric genus of B.

By Lemma 4.5 of [\cite=CM], we have two cases exactly:

[formula]

[formula]

Write

[formula]

where Z is the fixed part and N the movable one. Then it is obvious that

[formula]

Set F: = π*(S). One may write

[formula]

as a disjoint union of distinct fibers of f, where a = pg(X) - 1 whenever b = 0, or a = pg(X) otherwise. Thus we have

[formula]

where Fi  =  π*(Si).

If |N| has base points, then F2 > 0 as a 1-cycle. Thus KX  ·  F2  ≥  2 because it is an even number. Then it is obvious that

[formula]

Otherwise, |N| is base point free. In this case, F is a nonsingular projective surface with ample KF. Also since Z|F  ~  KF and K2F = 1, we see that Z|F is an irreducible curve on the surface F. Because f obviously factors through X, we denote by f1 the induced fibration X  →  B. Denote by C the curve [formula]. Because C  ~  KF, C must be a curve with arithmetical genus 2. Thus C must be one of the following types:

a) C is smooth;

b) C is an elliptic curve with exactly one node;

c) C is an elliptic curve with exactly one cusp of type x2 = y3;

d) C is a rational curve with exactly 2 nodes;

e) C is a rational curve with one node and one cusp of type x2 = y3;

f) C is a rational curve with exactly 2 cusps of type x2 = y3;

g) C is a rational curve with only one cusp of type x2 = y5.

We will see later that the singularities on C have strong connections with the value of K3X.

We consider the linear system |KX'  +  π*(KX)| on X'. For a general fiber S, denote by σ:S  →  F the natural contraction.

Now we fix some notations. Assume m > 0 is an integer and 0  ≤  n < m. Under the premise of a  ≥  m, we may write a: = a1m + s where a1 > 0 is an integer and 0  ≤  s < m. One may find distinct smooth fibers {Sk} such that

[formula]

Suppose the following condition (*) is satisfied:

(*) there is a number r  ≥  3 such that, for all i with a - a1n  ≤  i  ≤  a,

[formula]

Because

[formula]

is nef and big, one has, according to the Kawamata-Viehweg vanishing theorem, the exact sequence:

[formula]

Similarly because

[formula]

is nef and big, one has again the exact sequence:

[formula]

Noting that

[formula]

we have

[formula]

On the other hand, we have

[formula]

Whenever h2(OX) = 0, the surjective map

[formula]

gives

[formula]

In this situation, we set δ: = 2.

Whenever b = 0 and h2(OX) = 1, we have

[formula]

Whence we set δ: = 1.

The above two exact sequences give Since

[formula]

one has

[formula]

The above inequality is a key to better inequalities provided we know all the numbers rj, r and n. We study it case by case as follows. We first present the following

On the general fiber S of f, denote by [formula] Then h0(S,KS + D) = 2 if and only if D is supported on a rational tree.

Let N be a very big natural number such that [formula]. Because

[formula]

is nef and big. Using the Riemann-Roch and the vanishing theorem, we get

[formula]

So h0(S,KS + D) = 2 if and only if

[formula]

Because D is 1-connected and reduced, it is the obvious fact that D supports on a rational tree. We are done.

If there is a smooth fiber F on X such that [formula] is in the case [\ref=main] a), b) and c). Taking a smooth modification to the morphism f|D:D  ↦  B. One may easily see that C is always among these 3 types for a general fiber F. Thus we have rj  ≥  3 for all j by Lemma [\ref=reduce]. We may take n = 0.

Now if b = 1, then the inequality ([\ref=key]) gives

[formula]

If b = 0 and h2(OX) = 1, then ([\ref=key]) gives

[formula]

If b = 0 and h2(OX) = 0, then ([\ref=key]) gives

[formula]

We are left the situation that, for a general fiber F of f1, C falls into the cases [\ref=main] d) through g). For these cases, our argument depend on a special modification π.

From now on, we may suppose that C is a singular rational curve for a general fiber F of f1. We proceed our proof by considering the singularities on the surface Z. First of all, Z must be singular along a curve. Otherwise, if Z has isolated singularities, C would be a smooth curve of genus 2 which contradicts to our assumption.

We hope to find a special embedded resolution of the pair (X,Z) to prove Theorem [\ref=T1].

Z has at most 2 horizontal (with respect to f1) irreducible singular curves and the multiplicity of any such singular curve on Z is 2.

In the process of finding the embedded resolution for (X,Z), we do not care those vertical modifications supported only on finite number of fibers with regard to the fibration f1:X  →  B. This is because those vertical modifications do not affect the behavior of π*(KX)|S for a general fiber S of f. By abuse of concepts, we call this kind of vertical modifications to be negligible.

Pick up any irreducible singular curve G of Z such that f1(G) = B. Because G has at most finite number of singular points, we may take a negligible modification π0:X0  →  X such that G is smooth upstairs. Denote by Z0 the strict transform of Z. We still denote by G the strict transform of G upstairs. On X0, Z0 has a singular curve along G and G is a smooth curve.

Let π1:X1  →  X0 be a blow-up along the curve G. Denote by E1 the exceptional divisor on X1. One may write

[formula]

where Z1 is the strict transform of Z0 and m  ≥  2, because G belongs to singular locus of Z0.

We consider the following commutative diagram:

[formula]

where S(0)  =  π- 10(F) and S(1)  =  π- 11(S(0)). Denote by Z1  ⊂  X1 the strict transform of Z0. Then one sees that [formula] is irreducible. Also σ1 is the blow-up along the center [formula]. Now we have

[formula]

Because m  ≥  2, we see that G actually passes through a singular point of C. Since C has at most double points, m  ≤  2. Thus m = 2 and E1|S(1) is either an irreducible ( - 1)-curve or a sum of two distinct ( - 1)-curves. This also means that, on X0, one has 1  ≤  G  ·  S(0)  ≤  2.

Now it is clear that Z has at most two dictinct horizontal singular curves like G and the multiplicity of each is 2. The lemma is proved.

Based on the above argument, it is actually clear for us to illustrate all possibilities. Explicitly we have the following possibilities:

I) if Z1 is still singular along certain curve over G, then C1 is still singular and C must have only one cusp (of type x2 = y5). In this case, G is the only singular curve of Z and Z1 is singular along only one curve;

II) if Z1 is smooth at generic points of [formula] and the natural map {E1|Z1}red  ↦  G is not birational, then C has a node at each point of [formula].

III) if Z1 is smooth at generic points of [formula] and the natural map {E1|Z1}red  ↦  G is birational, then C has a cusp (of type x2 = y3) at each point [formula].

For Case II), one has the same inequalities as in [\ref=abc].

If we are at Case II), then π*(KX)|S = π*(Z)|S always contains an elliptic cycle C0 + C1 with g(C0) = g(C1) = 0 and C0  ·  C1 = 2 for a general fiber S. This means, for any j, one has rj  ≥  3 by Lemma [\ref=reduce]. We then take n = 0 and get the same inequalities as in [\ref=abc].

Combining all arguments above, we are left the following 3 situations derived from possibilities I) and III):

A) Z has only one horizontal singular curve G, C has only one cusp (of type x2 = y5) for a general fiber F and G meets the singular point of C;

B) Z has only one horizontal singular curve G, C has exactly 2 cusps (of type x2 = y3) for a general fiber F, and G meets the 2 singular points of C;

B') Z has two distinct horizontal singular curves G and H, C has exactly 2 cusps (of type x2 = y3) for a general fiber F, and both G and H meet one singular point each of C.

We construct an embedded resolution πA for the pair (X,Z) of Type A). Take π0 and π1 to be as in the proof of Claim [\ref=C1]. Because Z1 still has a unique singular curve which is over G, we denote such a curve by G1. Modulo negligible modifications, one may assume G1 to be again nonsingular.

Let π2:X2  →  X1 be the blow-up along G1. Denote by Z2 the strict transform of Z1 and by E2 the exceptional divisor. Set S(2)  =  π- 12(S(1)). Denote by σ2:S(2)  →  S(1) the respective blow-up. Because of the singularity type of C, one sees that the strict transform C2 of C is already smooth. Since E2 only touches C2 at one point, we denote by G2 the reduced part of E2|Z2 which is of course irreducible. By considering the multiplicity of G2 in Z2 (for instance taking blowing-ups and then considering its impacts on C2), one may see that Z2 is smooth at generic points of G2. Modulo negligible modifications, Z2 is already smooth. But the pull-back of Z is in general not of normal crossing. We need more blow-ups.

Let π3:X3  →  X2 be the blow-up along G2 which, modulo negligible modifications, is a smooth curve. Let E3 be the exceptional divisor and Z3 the strict transform of Z2. Denote by S(3)  =  π- 13(S(2)). Then one may see that E2, E3 and Z3 meet at an irreducible curve G3.

Finally blow-up X3 along the curve G3 (which could be smooth modulo negligible modifications), we get π4:X4  →  X3. Denote by E4 the exceptional divisor. Take more negligible modifications, we get a resolution πA:X'  →  X which is the composition of πi and those necessary negligible modifications. We replace our original π by πA, keeping the same notations as above. Pick up a general fiber S, then we may see that

[formula]

where Li are respective exceptional divisors induced from those blow-ups of πi for i = 1, 2, 3, 4 and [formula] is the strict transform of C.

Denote by σ:S  →  F the induced blow-up. Then σ*(C) = π*(Z)|S. From the whole process of blow-ups, one sees that σ*(C) is a normal crossing divisor on S. The intersection graph of σ*(C) is as follows:

Take two joint objects from {, E1, E2, E3, E4}, they meet a general fiber S at exactly one point. According to the next lemma, the divisor

[formula]

is normal crossing over a general point of B. Taking necessary negligible modifications, πA is finally an embedded resolution of (X,Z).

Let P be a point of a smooth variety V. Suppose I have 3 irreducible smooth divisor Hi  ⊂  V for i = 1, 2, 3 such that P∈Hi for all i. Assume

[formula]

Then H1 + H2 + H3 is a normal crossing divisor at P.

This is a trivial statement. Denote by fi the local equations of Hi for all i. Then, by definition,

[formula]

This means that f1, f2 and f3 actually form a local parameters of the point P. We are done.

The construction is somehow similar to [\ref=A]. Both Type B) and Type B') are essentially the same case. We omit those minor differences of the details for Type B) which is simply a copy of the one below. The most important point is that, for Type B) and Type B'), we finally have the same π*(Z)|S for a general fiber S.

Take π0 to be as in the proof of Claim [\ref=C1]. Let π1:X1  →  X0 be the blow-up along two smooth curve G and H. Denote by Z1 the strict transform of Z, and by E1, E1' the exceptional divisors. Similarly, one may see that Z1 is already smooth simply because of the singularity type of C. We also see that E1 (or E1') and Z1 meet at an irreducible curve G1 (or H1). Modulo negligible modifications, one may assume both G1 and H1 are smooth curves. We keep parallel notations as in [\ref=A].

Going on blow-ups along G1 and H1, one gets π2:X2  →  X1. Denote by E2, E2' the exceptional divisors. One sees that E2 (or E2'), E1 (or E1') and Z2 still meet along an irreducible curve G2 (or H2). One may take negligible modifications such that G2 and H2 are smooth.

We finally blow-up X2 along G2 and H2 to obtain π3:X3  →  X2. Taking further negligible modification, we get a resolution πB:X'  →  X. We have

[formula]

The slice on a general fiber S is

[formula]

where Li = Ei|S and Li' = Ei'|S for all i. The intersection graph is as follows.

Applying Lemma [\ref=nc], one may see that πB is an embedded resolution of (X,Z).

We apply the argument in [\ref=main]. We take two integers m and n such that [formula] Write a: = a1m + s as in [\ref=main]. In order to get an effective inequality, we only need to verify the condition (*). For simplicity, we still denote πA by π. Recall that we have

[formula]

where L24 =  - 1 and all these curves are smooth rational curves. Set D0: = (π*(Z)|S)red. Then D0 is of course a rational tree. From the intersection form of π*(Z)|S, we have

[formula]

Now we verify the condition (*). For a general fiber S, we have

[formula]

Thus the inequality ([\ref=key]) gives

[formula]

Now we see that, if pg(X) is very big (thus m can be big), then the ratio K3X / pg(X) is close to [formula], a very good inequality. The inequality in Theorem [\ref=T1] allows us to assume pg(X)  ≥  5 and so a  ≥  4. We may take m = 4 and n = 3. Apparently, [formula] because s < 4 by definition.

Explicitly, if b = 1, then we have

[formula]

This is better than the inequality in Theorem [\ref=T1] only whenever pg(X)  ≥  7. But the trivial inequality K3X  ≥  pg(X) amends whenever pg(X)  ≤  6.

If b = 0 and h2(OX) = 0, then we have

[formula]

This is better than the inequality in Theorem [\ref=T1].

If b = 0 and h2(OX) = 1, then we have

[formula]

This is much better than what we want in Theorem [\ref=T1].

We take positive integers m and n such that [formula]. Write a: = a1m + s as in [\ref=main]. In order to get an effective inequality, we only need to verify the condition (*). For simplicity, we still denote πB by π. Recall that we have

[formula]

where L23  =  L3'2 =  - 1 and all these curves are smooth rational curves. Set D0: = (π*(Z)|S)red. Then D0 is of course a rational tree. From the intersection form of π*(Z)|S, we have

[formula]

Now we verify the condition (*). For a general fiber S, we have

[formula]

Thus the inequality ([\ref=key]) gives

[formula]

Still one may see that, if pg(X) is bigger, the ratio K3X / pg(X) is close to [formula]. Under the assumption of pg(X)  ≥  4, we may take m = 3 and n = 2. So

[formula]

Explicitly, if b = 1, then we have

[formula]

This is better than what we want in Theorem [\ref=T1].

If b = 0 and h2(OX) = 0, then we have

[formula]

This is also better than what we want in Theorem [\ref=T1].

If b = 0 and h2(OX) = 1, then we have

[formula]

Already these inequalities are better than the one in Theorem [\ref=T1].

Comparing what we have got, we may conclude Theorem [\ref=T1].

If [formula], then we have pg(X)  ≥  5. This means that we have the canonical map. From the argument above, the only possibility is that X is canonically fibred by curves of genus 2. This inequality is not empty according to Kobayashi's example.

If K3X < 2pg(X) - 6, then one has pg(X)  ≥  5. We may study the canonical map. Both [\ref=B3] and Theorem [\ref=known1] tell that either X is canonically fibred by curves of genus 2 or X is canonically fibred by surfaces of general type with (c21,pg) = (1,2). We study the later case.

We take the induced fibration f:X'  →  B where a general fiber S is a smooth projective surface with (c21,pg) = (1,2). Noting that f*ωX' / B is a vector bundle of rank 2 because pg(S) = 2, we considering the natural projection

[formula]

Because KX' + S1 + S2  ≥  KX', we see that the fibration f rationally factors through p. Taking birational modifications, we may have a morphism from f to p. Thus we have the following commutative diagram:

[formula]

For any fiber S of f, we see that ψ|S  =  φKS because we have

[formula]

by Lemma 4.6 of [\cite=CM], where the Si are general smooth fibers of f. Therefore ψ is actually a fibration over a ruled surface with a general fiber a smooth curve of genus 2. We are done.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=T2]

Though partial effective Noether type of inequalities for a general minimal 3-fold are given in [\cite=CM], there remain several hard cases to study. In this section, we are able to develop the technique in [\cite=IJM] to present integral and more precise results which make it possible for us to describe those 3-folds with small slope [formula].

We are treating a general object so that most of the divisors we come across are rational divisors. In order to prove Theorem [\ref=T2], we may assume that X is a normal projective minimal 3-fold with only [formula]-factorial terminal singularities. We suppose pg(X)  ≥  2.

We study the canonical map φ1 which is usually a rational map. Take the birational modification π:X'  →  X, according to Hironaka, such that

(i) X' is smooth;

(ii) the movable part of |KX'| is basepoint free. (Sometimes we even call for such a modification that those movable parts of a finite number of linear systems are all basepoint free.)

(iii) π*(KX) is linearly equivalent to a divisor supported by a divisor of normal crossings.

Denote by g the composition [formula]. So [formula] is a morphism. Let [formula] be the Stein factorization of g. So we have the same commutative diagram as in [\ref=notations]. Write

[formula]

where M1 is the movable part of |KX'|, Z1 the fixed part and E1 an effective [formula]-divisor which is a [formula]-sum of distinct exceptional divisors. Throughout we always mean π*(KX) by KX'  -  E1. So, whenever we take the round up of mπ*(KX), we always have [formula] for all positive number m. We may also write

[formula]

where E1' = Z1 - E1 is actually an effective [formula]-divisor.

If dim φ1(X) = 2, we see that a general fiber of f is a smooth projective curve C of genus g  ≥  2. If dim φ1(X) = 1, we see that a general fiber S of f is a smooth projective surface S of general type. The invariants of S are (c21(S0),pg(S)) where S0 is the minimal model of S.

A generic irreducible element S of |M1| means either a general member of |M1| whenever dim φ1(X)  ≥  2 or, otherwise, a general fiber of f.

For reader's convenience, we recall known results from [\cite=CM].

(Theorem 3 and Proposition 3.4 of [\cite=CM]) Under the above assumptions, one has

1) K3X  ≥  2pg(X) - 4 whenever pg(X)  ≥  6, dim (B) = 2 and g(C)  ≥  3;

2) [formula] whenever pg(X)  ≥  10, (c21(S0),pg(S)) = (1,1), dim (B) = 1 and dim φ2KX(X)  ≥  2.

Standard surface theory tells us that a surface S of general type with K2S0 = 1 has only 2 possibilities: either pg(S) = 1 or pg(S) = 2.

Before proving Theorem [\ref=T2], we must study the other cases. The following proposition presents a general method to estimate certain intersection numbers on X.

Let X be a minimal projective 3-fold of general type with only [formula]-factorial terminal singularities and assume pg(X)  ≥  2. Keep the same notations as in [\ref=symbols] . Pick up a generic irreducible element S of |M1|. Suppose, on the smooth surface S, there is a movable linear system |G| and denote by C a generic irreducible element of |G|. Set ξ: = (π*(KX)  ·  C)X' and

[formula]

Assume

(i) there is a rational number β > 0 such that π*(KX)|S  -  βC is numerically equivalent to an effective [formula]-divisor;

(ii) the inequality [formula] holds. Set [formula]. Then we have the inequality

[formula]

.

This is a weak version of Theorem 2.2 in [\cite=IJM]. We do not need the birationality of φm. So one may drop additional assumptions there.

We have

[formula]

where a  ≥  pg(X) - 1. So one has

[formula]

If b = g(B) > 0, then the movable part of |KX| is already base point free. Thus one has

[formula]

Thus π*(KX)2  ·  S = (σ*(KS0))2  ≥  2. So

[formula]

From now on, we assume b = 0 and pg(X)  ≥  12. In order to apply Proposition [\ref=estimate], we must find the number β and the curve C.

Note that pg(X) > 0 implies pg(S) > 0. According to [\cite=Ci], we know that |2KS0| is base point free. So is |2σ*(KS0)|. We set C be a general member of |2σ*(KS0)|. So C is a smooth curve with deg (KC)  ≥  12. According to Step 2 of Proposition 3.3 in [\cite=CM], we have

[formula]

Thus we may set [formula]. Also one may set p = 11. An initial lower bound for ξ is

[formula]

Now we may choose m and run Proposition [\ref=estimate].

Take m1 = 4. Then [formula]. So α0  ≥  2. Applying Proposition [\ref=estimate], one gets [formula].

Take m2 = 5. Then [formula]. So α0  ≥  6. Applying Proposition [\ref=estimate], one gets [formula].

Take m3 = 6. Then [formula]. So α0  ≥  10. Applying Proposition [\ref=estimate], one gets [formula] which might be the best bound through our method.

So we have [formula] Thus we have the inequality

[formula]

We assume pg(X)  ≥  10. Considering the induced fibration f:X'  →  B, we have q(X)  ≤  1 and q(X) - h2(OX)  ≥  0 according to [\cite=JMSJ2]. In fact, this case is very simple since f*ωX' is an invertible sheaf while R1f*ωX' = 0. So we have

[formula]

Applying Reid's plurigenus formula ([\cite=YPG]), one has

[formula]

We may remodify our original π such that the movable part of |2KX'| is also base point free. Write

[formula]

where M2 is the movable part. One has

[formula]

where a2  ≥  P2(X) - 1. Because

[formula]

we have

[formula]

So the key point might be to estimate the number (π*(KX)|S)2 which is a rational number.

The base point freeness of |2σ*(KS0)| allows us to take C to be a general member of this system. Then C is a smooth curve with deg (KC) = 6. Because

[formula]

we may take [formula] Similarly [formula] by Step 2 of Proposition 3.3 in [\cite=CM], we may take [formula]. We have [formula]

Now take m1 = 5. Then

[formula]

Proposition [\ref=estimate] gives [formula].

Take m2 = 6. Then

[formula]

Proposition [\ref=estimate] gives [formula].

Take m3 = 7. Then

[formula]

Proposition [\ref=estimate] gives [formula].

In general, we may get

[formula]

for all mk  ≥  8 by induction. Thus ξ  ≥  2. This means [formula] So the inequality ([\ref=bu]) becomes

[formula]

Assume [formula] Because K3X > 0, one sees that pg(X)  ≥  2. So one may always consider the canonical map φ1. Suppose pg(X)  ≥  12. According to [\ref=B3], Theorem [\ref=known3] and the inequalities ([\ref=K2]) and ([\ref=K=1]), X must be either canonically fibred by curves of genus 2 or canonically fibred by surfaces of general type with (c21,pg) = (1,2). Then a parallel argument to that in the proof of Theorem [\ref=T1.5] also works. We are done.

In fact, a combination of [\cite=CM] and this section may present the following more general result for which we omit the details.

There are two sequences (computable) of positive rational numbers {ak} and {bk} with k  ≥  2 such that

1) [formula] for all k  ≥  2 and ak1  ≤  ak2 whenever k1 < k2;

2) lim k  →    +    ∞ak = 2 and {bk} is bounded;

3) for any minimal projective 3-fold X of general type with canonical singularities, set [formula] If K3X < akpg(X) - bk and [formula], then X is fibred by curves of genus 2.

The only known examples satisfying the equality in Theorem [\ref=T1] or the assumption of both Theorem [\ref=T1.5] and Theorem [\ref=T2] were found by M. Kobayashi ([\cite=Kob]).

If X is a Gorenstein minimal projective threefold of general type with only canonical singularities, then it is well-known that χ(OX) < 0 according to Miyaoka ([\cite=M]). There should be an analogue of the Noether inequality as in Theorem [\ref=T1] in the form:

[formula]

where a and b are positive rational numbers. One may try to study the bicanonical map of X. We have an effective lower bound for a. Any bound a > 1 is nontrivial and interesting. The author's opinion is that to find a Noether inequality in this direction is more difficult simply because the inter relations among pg, q and h2(OX) are far from being clear to us, unlike in surface case.
