LATTICE STUDY OF THE POMERON

The Pomeron trajectory was introduced to describe certain features of hadronic scattering: total hadronic cross sections slowly rising with energy, their factorisation, the observation that the elastic amplitude is predominantly imaginary, and the quark-counting rule. This description has proved remarkably durable, and interest in pomeron physics has been renewed by recent results from HERA. In this talk we will investigate a particular QCD model of the pomeron, the non-perturbative Landshoff-Nachtmann (LN) two-gluon-exchange (2GE) model,[\cite=ln:87] within a lattice gauge simulation. We will then suggest how the Pomeron may be investigated from a lattice gauge simulation at a more fundamental level.

The 2GE model has proved highly successful at describing Pomeron exchange. Crucial to the model is that the gluons be infra-red finite. Recently, the phenomenology has been explored using gluon propagators from the solution of the Schwinger-Dyson equation.[\cite=halzen:93] [\cite=ducati:93] In this talk we will explore the phenomenology using lattice gluon propagators in the Landau gauge.

The momentum dependence of the gluon propagator we extract from the lattice simulation. The "effective" coupling of the gluon propagator to a quark we determine by requiring that the Pomeron-quark coupling, Î²0, attain its phenomenological value. We perform the calculation at several volumes and lattice spacings to control systematic uncertainties due to the finite volume and non-zero lattice spacing.[\cite=dgr:96]

As an example of the calculation, we show in Figure [\ref=fig:isr_data] a comparison of the model with the pp differential cross section, using three lattices at different volumes and spacings; both the total cross section and the slope of the differential cross section are close to their phenomenological values. The calculation also exhibits two further features of diffractive scattering: the quark counting rule, and the weaker coupling of the Pomeron to mesons composed of heavy quarks.

Encouraged by this application of the LN model, we are tempted to go further, and explore the nature of the Pomeron-quark vertex.[\cite=vertex] Here we are using a colour-singlet source for the Pomeron constructed from the gauge fields, and the lattice quark propagator fixed to the Landau Gauge. This should provide a valuable clue to the mechanism for diffractive physics in QCD.
