WAVELET PERSPECTIVE OF A DISORIENTED CHIRAL CONDENSATE

In heavy-ion collisions the rapid expansion of the collision debris in the longitudinal direction may lead to supercooling of the interaction region, and as a result, domains of the "unconventionally" oriented vacuum configurations allowed by the chiral symmetry may be formed.[\cite=dcc] Detection of this interesting phenomenon, the so-called Disoriented Chiral Condensate (DCC) [\cite=dcc], would provide valuable information on the vacuum structure of the strong interaction and the nature of the chiral phase transition. Preliminary theoretical investigations on non-equilibrium dynamics using the classical linear σ-model have found some evidence for the growth of long wavelength pion modes, which may indeed lead to domain structure or cluster formation.[\cite=rw] [\cite=hw] If there are many uncorrelated small domains, the integrated probability distribution of the neutral pion fraction f emitted from a disoriented region, predicted to be [formula], [\cite=dcc] would become Gaussian. This makes the experimental search for the DCC signal a rather difficult task. In order to disentangle the DCC domain structure in high energy heavy-ion collisions, we propose a new method which emphasizes not only the behavior of the probability distribution in the full phase space region but also its fluctuation in rapidity η or azimuthal angle φ. In other words, one needs to study the "local" properties of the distribution in phase space if the DCC clusters are "localized" objects in phase space.

A novel method is a multi-resolution analysis performed by a discrete wavelet transformation (DWT) [\cite=wavelet] which has been found effective in systematically detecting structures of various scales in turbulence, and multiparticle productions.[\cite=farge] [\cite=carr] For any one-dimensional sample of a point distribution f(x), such as the rapidity distribution of the neutral pion fraction in the interval
