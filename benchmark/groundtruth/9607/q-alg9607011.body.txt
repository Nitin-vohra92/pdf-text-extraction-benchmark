Demazure Modules and Perfect Crystals

Introduction

In [\cite=S] Sanderson calculated the character of the Demazure module Vw(λ) of   2 specialized at e-  δ = 1 (δ: the null root) using Littelmann's path [\cite=L]. To state more precisely, we set

[formula]

where r0,r1 are the simple reflections, and i = 0 (k:even), = 1 (k:odd). Let Vw(k)(λ) be the U(+)-module generated by an extremal vector of weight w(k)λ of the irreducible highest weight U(  2)-module of highest weight λ. Let Vl be the (l + 1)-dimensional irreducible module of   2. Taking λ = lΛ0 for simplicity, her result reads as

[formula]

This suggests that there exists a tensor product structure in the Demazure module at a combinatorial level.

Now let [formula] be any affine Lie algebra. As for the irreducible highest weight Uq()-module V(λ) at q = 0, we have a combinatorial object path. (This path is different from Littelmann's path.) It has emerged in the study of solvable lattice models (cf. [\cite=DJKMO1],[\cite=DJKMO2]). Its study is accomplished with the aid of crystal base theory (cf. [\cite=KMN1],[\cite=KMN2]). Let B be a perfect crystal of level l. Then, for any dominant integral weight λ of level l, the crystal B(λ) of V(λ) is represented as a set of paths. Roughly speaking, a path is an element of the semi-infinite tensor product [formula] with some stability condition. On the other hand, Kashiwara [\cite=Ka] gave a recursive formula to obtain the Demazure crystal Bw(λ) for any symmetrizable Kac-Moody algebra. Denoting the Bruhat order by [formula], it reads as follows.

[formula]

Thus, it seems natural to ask how Bw(λ) is characterized in the set of paths in the case of affine Lie algebras.

In this article, we present a criterion for the Demazure crystal Bw(λ) to have a tensor product structure. To explain more precisely, let w(k) ([formula]) be an increasing sequence of affine Weyl group elements with respect to the Bruhat order, let [formula] be a highest weight vector of B(λ). Then, under the assumptions (I-IV) in section 2.3, we can show the following isomorphism of crystals.

[formula]

Here [formula] are determined when checking the assumptions, and λj  =  σj(λ) with a Dynkin diagram automorphism σ is defined from the perfect crystal B. In Sanderson's case above, we have j = k,a = 1,κ = 1,B(j)a = B and B is the crystal of the (l + 1)-dimensional irreducible Uq(  2)-module. As a corollary, we can see

[formula]

The plan of this article is as follows. In section 1, we summarize the theory of perfect crystal. We introduce Kashiwara's Demazure crystal Bw(λ), and state the main result in section 2. We apply our result to the   n symmetric tensor case in section 3. A relation between Demazure characters and Kostka-Foulkes polynomials and some other discussions are included in section 4.

Perfect crystal

Notation

We follow the notations of the quantized universal enveloping algebra and the crystal base in [\cite=KMN1]. In particular, {αi}i∈I is the set of simple roots, {hi}i∈I is the simple coroots, P is the weight lattice and [formula]. Uq() is the quantized universal enveloping algebra of an affine Lie algebra [formula]. V(λ) is the irreducible highest weight module of highest weight λ∈P+, [formula] is its highest weight vector, (L(λ),B(λ)) is its crystal base.

For the notation of a finite-dimensional representation of U'q(), we follow section 3 in [\cite=KMN1]. For instance, Pcl is the classical weight lattice, U'q() is the subalgebra of Uq() generated by ei,fi,qh (h∈(Pcl)*) and f(,Pcl) is the category of finite-dimensional U'q()-modules which have the weight decompositions. We set [formula] and [formula], where c is the canonical central element. Assume V in f(,Pcl) has a crystal base (L,B). For an element b of B, we set [formula], [formula] and [formula], [formula].

Perfect crystal

In [\cite=KMN1] Kang et al. introduced the notion of perfect crystal. For the definition of the perfect crystal, see Definition 4.6.1 in [\cite=KMN1].

Let B be a perfect crystal of level l. For λ∈(P+cl)l, let b(λ)∈B be the element such that φ(b(λ)) = λ. From the definition of perfect crystal, such a b(λ) exists and is unique. Let σ be the automorphism of (P+cl)l given by σλ  =  ε(b(λ)). We set [formula] and λk  =  σkλ. Then perfectness assures that we have the isomorphism of crystals

[formula]

Iterating this isomorphism, we have

[formula]

Defining the set of paths P(λ,B) by

[formula]

we see that B(λ) is isomorphic to P(λ,B). Under this isomorphism, the highest weight vector in B(λ) corresponds to the path [formula]. We call [formula] the ground-state path.

Actions of ẽi and i

We need to know the actions of ẽi and i on the set of paths P(λ,B). To see this, we consider the following isomorphism.

[formula]

For each p∈P(λ,B), if we take k sufficiently large, we can assume that p corresponds to [formula] with uλk the highest weight vector of B(λk) and p(n)∈B ([formula]). Then we apply Proposition 2.1.1 in [\cite=KN] to see on which component ẽi or i acts. Let us suppose that ẽi or i acts on the j-th component from the right end. If j < k + 1, we have

[formula]

or

[formula]

If j = k + 1, we see we should have taken k larger. This happens only for i.

This determination of the component can be rephrased using the notion of signature. Let p∈P(λ,B) correspond to [formula] under ([\ref=eq:iso1]) as above. With p(j) (1  ≤  j  ≤  k), we associate

[formula]

For the highest weight vector uλk, we take

[formula]

We then append these ε(j)'s so that we have

[formula]

We call it signature of p truncated at the k-th position.

Next we consider a sequence of signatures.

[formula]

Here ηj + 1 is obtained from ηj by deleting the leftmost adjacent ( + , - ) pair of ηj. Eventually, we arrive at the following signature

[formula]

with [formula]. We call it the reduced signature and denote by [formula].

The component on which ẽi or i acts in ([\ref=eq:action_e]) or ([\ref=eq:action_f]) reads as follows. If n- = 0 (resp. n+ = 0), we set ẽip = 0 (resp. ip = 0). Otherwise, take the rightmost -   (resp. leftmost +  ), and find the component ε(j) to which it belonged. Then, this j is the position in ([\ref=eq:action_e]) (resp. ([\ref=eq:action_f])) we looked for. Note that if k is large enough, the position j does not depend on the choice of k.

Of course, this signature rule can be applied to the tensor product of two crystals [formula].

Let   =    2, B be the classical crystal of the 3-dimensional irreducible representation. Its crystal graph is described as follows.

[formula]

It is known that B is perfect of level 2. We have isomorphisms B(λ)≃P(λ,B) for λ = 2Λ0,Λ0  +  Λ1,2Λ1. Let λ = 2Λ0. We see λk = 2Λ0 (k:), 2Λ1 (k:). The ground-state path is given by

[formula]

Consider a path

[formula]

The dotted part of p is the same as that of [formula]. Then the signature of p truncated at the 5-th position with respect to i = 1 and its reduced signature read as follows.

[formula]

Here the number above each sign shows the component to which it belonged. Consequently, we have

[formula]

Weight of a path

A map [formula] is called energy function if for any b,b'∈B and i∈I such that [formula], it satisfies

[formula]

It is shown (Proposition 4.5.4 in [\cite=KMN1]) that under the isomorphism between B(λ) and P(λ,B), the weight of a path [formula] is given by

[formula]

For the definition of af, along with cl, see section 3 of [\cite=KMN1].

Crystal of the Demazure module

Demazure module

Let {ri}i∈I be the set of simple reflections, and let W be the Weyl group. For w∈W, l(w) denote the length of w, and [formula] denote the Bruhat order on W. Let U+q() be the subalgebra of Uq() generated by ei's. We consider the irreducible highest weight Uq()-module V(λ) ([formula]). It is known that for w∈W, the extremal weight space V(λ)wλ is one dimensional. Let Vw(λ) denote the U+q()-module generated by V(λ)wλ. These modules Vw(λ) (w∈W) are called the Demazure modules. They are finite-dimensional subspaces of V(λ).

Kashiwara's recursive formula

Let (L(λ),B(λ)) be the crystal base of V(λ). In [\cite=Ka] Kashiwara showed that for each w∈W, there exists a subset Bw(λ) of B(λ) such that

[formula]

Furthermore, Bw(λ) has the following recursive property.

[formula]

This beautiful formula is essential in our consideration below.

Theorem

We list the assumptions required for our theorem. Let λ be an element of (P+cl)l, and let B be a classical crystal. Firstly, we assume

Therefore, B(λ) is isomorphic to the set of paths P(λ,B). Let [formula] be the ground-state path.

We fix positive integers d,κ. For a set of elements i(j)a in I ([formula]), we define B(j)a ([formula]) by

[formula]

Using these, we next define B(j + 1,j)a ([formula]) by

[formula]

Similar definitions continue until we define

[formula]

Let us now assume

If κ = 1, the right hand side should be understood as B. We call κ a mixing index. We normally take the minimal one. The following proposition is sometimes useful. It is proved in the same way as in the theorem using Lemma [\ref=lemma]. Thus we omit the proof.

If [formula], then [formula] for a  ≤  a'  ≤  d.

We introduce the third condition.

Since the automorphism σ is of finite order, it suffices to check the conditions (II),(III) for finite j's.

For the last assumption, we define w(k) by

[formula]

where j and a are fixed by [formula].

This condition is equivalent to l(w(k)) = k. The following proposition is convenient to check (IV).

If 〈wμ,hj〉 > 0 for some [formula], then [formula].

Proof.  From 〈μ,w- 1hj〉 > 0, we see w- 1hj is a positive coroot. This is equivalent to w- 1αj∈Σ+, where Σ+ is the set of positive roots. To see this is equivalent to [formula], we refer, for example, to proposition 4(i) in section 5.2 (p.411) of [\cite=MP].

Now we define a subset P(k)(λ,B) of P(λ,B) as follows. We set [formula]. For k > 0, we take j and a such that [formula], and set

[formula]

Under the assumptions (I-IV), we have

[formula]

Proof of the theorem

For the proof of the theorem, we need the following simple but useful lemma.

Let B1,B2 be crystals, and let b1∈B1,b2∈B2. For any [formula], there exist [formula] such that

[formula]

Proof.  For a reduced signature [formula], let [formula] (resp. [formula]) denote the number of +  's (resp. -  's) in [formula]. Let [formula] be the reduced signature of bi (i = 1,2). We set [formula]. We divide the proof into two cases: (a) α - n  ≥  β, (b) α - n < β.

Consider the case (a). In this case, we simply take p = n,q = 0. Consider the case (b). In this case, we take p = β  -  α + 2n,q = β  -  α + n.

We proceed to the proof of the theorem.

Proof of the theorem.  In view of assumption (IV), we prove by induction on the length of w(k). If k = 0, i.e., w(k) = 1, the statement is true.

Next assume k > 0 and take j and a such that [formula]. From the recursive formula ([\ref=recursive]) and [formula], we have

[formula]

On the other hand, from induction hypothesis, we have

[formula]

Note that by definition, this is valid even for a = 1. In view of assumption (III), we see the action of i(j)a does not give any effect on the part [formula]. Thus we ignore this part in the following consideration. Then, in the case of j < κ, the proof turns out to be trivial. Assume j  ≥  κ, set [formula], and take any elements b1 and b2 from [formula] and B2. From Lemma [\ref=lemma], for any [formula], there exist [formula] such that

[formula]

Noting that [formula], we can conclude

[formula]

The other direction of the inclusion is clear.

Application to characters

Since we have established the weight preserving bijection between Bw(k)(λ) and P(k)(λ,B), the following proposition turns out to be an immediate corollary.

Under the assumptions (I-IV), we have

[formula]

where   p is given in ([\ref=eq:weight]).

In view of the tensor product structure of P(k)(λ,B) ([\ref=eq:def_P]), it would be more interesting to consider a classical character, which we define by

[formula]

Note that for B(λ), the classical character does not make sense.

Assume (I-IV). For [formula], take j and a such that k = (j - 1)d + a, [formula], 1  ≤  a  ≤  d. Then,

[formula]

Proof.  Let p be an element in P(k)(λ,B). From ([\ref=eq:weight]), the classical weight of p is given by

[formula]

Noting that [formula] (i > j), [formula] and λ0  =  λ, ([\ref=eq:clch]) reads as

[formula]

which immediately implies the statement.

n symmetric tensor case

In this section, we apply our theorem to the case of symmetric tensor representations of U'q(  n).

Preliminaries

In what follows, [formula] always means [formula]. Define δ(n)i by δ(n)i = 1 ([formula]), = 0 ([formula]). In the case of   =    n, we have 〈αi,hj〉 = 2δ(n)i - j  -  δ(n)i - j - 1  -  δ(n)i - j + 1 (i,j∈I), where [formula]. For our purpose, it is convenient to use the notations αi,hi,Λi,ri for [formula] by defining αi  =  αi', etc, if [formula].

Let Bl be the classical crystal of the level l symmetric tensor representation of U'q(  n). As a set, Bl is described as [formula]. The actions of ẽi,i are defined as follows.

[formula]

If the right hand side contains a negative component, we should understand it as 0.

Following section 1.2 of [\cite=KMN2], we describe the perfect crystal structure of Bl. (Note that we deal with the case of (A(1)n - 1,B(lΛ1)) in their notation.) From ([\ref=eq:sln_e]) and ([\ref=eq:sln_f]), it is easy to see [formula], [formula]. Setting [formula], we have [formula] and the automorphism σ is given by [formula]. Thus, the order of σ is n.

It is often convenient to consider automorphisms on I and Bl. By abuse of notation, we also denote them by σ. They are defined by

[formula]

It is easy to see the following properties.

[formula]

Using σ, we have [formula].

Sequence of Weyl group elements

We define [formula] by

[formula]

and set

[formula]

We are to prove

The sequence of Weyl group elements [formula] is increasing with respect to the Bruhat order.

For the proof, we prepare a lemma.

[formula], with d = n - 1.

Proof.  We prove by induction on k. Assuming the statement for k and setting [formula], we have

[formula]

Therefore, it is sufficient to show

[formula]

Note that γa  -  γa - 1  =  θ(a), where θ(a) = 1 if [formula], = 0 otherwise. We have

[formula]

This completes the proof.

Proof of the proposition.  We take Λ0 for μ, and apply Proposition [\ref=pr:Bruhat]. It suffices to show 〈w(k)Λ0,hk〉 > 0. The left hand side was already calculated to be [formula] in the proof of the previous lemma.

λ = lΛ0 case

We have seen that Bl is perfect of level l. We have shown that the sequence of Weyl group elements w(k) ([\ref=eq:sln_seq]) is increasing with respect to the Bruhat order. Thus, taking d = n - 1 and [formula] (0  ≤  i(j)a  ≤  n - 1), the assumptions (I) and (IV) are already satisfied. Let us take λ = lΛ0. Then, we have λj = lΛ- j and the ground-state path is given by [formula], [formula] with [formula] (0  ≤  i  ≤  n - 1). Let us describe B(j)a. Thanks to the automorphism σ, it is sufficient to consider the case of j = n. From ([\ref=eq:def_B1]) and i(n)a = a, we easily have

[formula]

Checking the assumption (III) is also trivial. Therefore, we have the following proposition.

For the case of λ = lΛ0, take d = n - 1 and [formula] (0  ≤  i(j)a  ≤  n - 1). Then, the assumptions (II) and (III) are satisfied with κ = 1.

λ arbitrary case

We show even if λ is any element in (P+cl)l, we have κ = 2 with the same choice of d and i(j)a as in the previous subsection. For [formula], define a subset [formula] of Bl by

[formula]

We now prepare a lemma.

Let [formula], [formula]. For any [formula] and b2∈Bl2, there exist an element [formula] and integers [formula] such that [formula], zi  ≤  xi - 1 [formula], where we set [formula], [formula], [formula].

Proof.  We prove by induction on n. If n = 1, the statement is trivial. Now assume the statement is valid when n - 1, and set [formula]. We divide into two cases:(a) xn - 2 > yn - 1, (b) xn - 2  ≤  yn - 1.

Consider the case (a). Assume [formula], then we have xn - 1  ≥  mn - 1. Consider elements [formula], [formula]. Ignoring the last component and using the induction hypothesis, we see there exist [formula] and [formula] such that [formula], and

[formula]

Apply xn - 1 - mn - 1n - 1 further, then we get [formula]. Checking another condition is easy.

We move to (b). The proof goes similarly. Take [formula] ([formula] are determined from the induction hypothesis) and pn - 1  =  xn - 1 - mn - 1 + yn - 1 - xn - 2.

For any λ∈(P+cl)l, take d = n - 1 and [formula] (0  ≤  i(j)a  ≤  n - 1). Then, the assumptions (II) and (III) are satisfied with κ = 2.

Proof.  We again reduce the proof for all j to the j = n case by the automorphism σ. Set [formula]. Note that i(n)a = a. Firstly, we claim that B(n)a consists of the elements [formula] satisfying

[formula]

This is easily shown by induction on a. Thus, we have 〈λn,ha〉  =  εa(B(n)a - 1) = ma, and (III) is checked.

It remains to show [formula]. Noting that [formula], it is equivalent to check

[formula]

Take any [formula] and b2∈Bl. From Lemma, there exist [formula] and [formula] such that [formula] [formula], zi  ≤  xi - 1 ([formula]). Noting that [formula], we see [formula]. Thus, we have shown the inclusion ⊃   in ([\ref=eq:to_check]).

The other direction of the inclusion is clear.

Discussion

We explain the suggestion by Kirillov. Consider the case of   =    n,B = Bl. We retain the notations in section 3. If L is divisible by n, we already know

[formula]

Therefore, Bw(Ld)(lΛ0) is invariant under the action of ẽi,i ([formula]). On the other hand, it has been shown recently that the Kostka-Foulkes polynomial Kλ(lL)(q) has the following expression (cf. [\cite=DF],[\cite=D],[\cite=NY]).

[formula]

where the sum is over all highest weight vectors [formula] with respect to ẽi ([formula]) with highest weight [formula]. Now Kirillov's suggestion reads as

[formula]

where λ runs over all partitions of lL of depth less or equal than n, [formula], q = e-  δ, zi = e-  αi = xi + 1 / xi ([formula]), and [formula] is the Schur function. Note that an expression of Kλμ(q) using Gaussian polynomials is known [\cite=Ki].

In this article, we have presented a criterion for the Demazure crystal to have a tensor product structure. One may ask if there are other cases than the   n symmetric tensor case which have a similar property. We claim that if [formula] is non-exceptional and λ = lΛ0 (plus some other λ), we can find a sequence of Weyl group elements which satisfies the assumptions (II-III) with κ = 1. We would like to report on that in a near future.

We are not only interested in the classical character, but also in the full character. One of the advantages to relate the Demazure crystal to a set of paths is that we can utilize the results on so-called 1D sums in solvable lattice models. In [\cite=FMO] we have seen that for   2 case, all characters of the Demazure modules are expressed in terms of q-multinomial coefficients. We also would like to deal with this subject for any non-exceptional affine Lie algebra (though the level will be 1) in another publication.
