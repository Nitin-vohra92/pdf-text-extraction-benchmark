Introduction

The theory of strong interaction physics is well understood within perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics(PQCD) [formula]. The PQCD describes the dynamics of quarks and gluons at very high energies. The laboratory experiments involving hadrons either in the initial state or final state can be understood by treating these quarks and gluons as asymptotic states and by safely using the perturbative techniques thanks to asymptotic freedom. In other words, the hadronic cross sections can be well expressed in terms of partonic cross sections. The Parton Model (PM) [\cite=ALT] has been a successful model to tie up these perturbatively calculable parton level cross sections and the experimentally measured cross sections. This involves the introduction of certain probability distributions which can not be calculable in PQCD but are just inputs of the model. Though they are not calculable, they are found to be universal in the sense that they are process independent and the evolution in terms of the scale is well known. In other words, if these probability distributions are measured in an experiment at a scale, say Q2 which is above the ΛQCD where the QCD perturbation theory is reliable, then these distributions can be used as inputs to predict the rates or cross sections of different experiments which involve these distributions. In this sense they are something to do with the hadrons participating in the process and are process independent. Also, using the well known Altarelli-Parisi evolution equation satisfied by these distributions, one can find out how these distributions change as the scale changes and thereby use them appropriately for the experiments done at various energies.

There are two types of such probability distributions one comes across in hadron physics. The well understood among them is the parton probability distribution. It is generally denoted by fa(h) / H(s)(x,Q2) and the meaning of it is the probability of finding a parton of type a with polarisation h inside the hadron H of polarisation s with momentum fraction x of the hadron and the scale Q2. These distributions are usually measured in Deep Inelastic Scattering(DIS) experiments. The universality of these distributions and the predicted evolution in terms of the scale Q2 are proved experimentally [formula]. The other distribution is nothing but the fragmentation function. The fragmentation functions are mirror image of the parton probability distributions. These functions are generally denoted by DH(s)a(h)(x,Q2). They measure the probability that a parton of type a with polarisation h fragments into a hadron of type H with polarisation s and carries away x fraction of the parton's momentum at a scale Q2 [\cite=BF]. These functions are usually measured in e- e+   →  H ~ X experiments. The universality and the Q2 evolution of unpolarised functions (which does not contain any information about the spin of the hadrons produced) are well understood.

In recent years, there has been several interesting works to understand these fragmentation functions. These include the measurement of the fragmentation functions for charged and neutral pions and kaons [formula]. The QCD inspired Parton Model analysis sublamented with Altarelli-Parisi evolution equations for these functions is shown to explain the pion and kaon production rates at leading and next-to-leading order [formula]. The another field of current interest is the inclusive Λ production at e- e+ scattering experiments [formula]. This is important as Λ  ~  s are produced copiously and also it is easy to detect them. On the theoretical side, the study of polarisation effects in the production cross sections is more interesting. As we know, at low energies the unpolarised e- e+ scattering will not produce longitudinally polarised Λ  ~  s (we do not attempt to review the transversely polarised Λ  ~  s produced in unpolarised scattering experiments) but when the center of mass energy crosses the Z threshold, then due to parity violating effects, the produced Λ  ~  s can naturally be polarised. Recall that these are produced due to the fragmentation of polarised partons produced in the scattering. Unfortunately, it is not clear how these partons fragment into these hadrons. There exists only model calculations which can tell us how much of the parton spin is transferred to Λ. In the naive quark model, the only contribution to polarised Λ is due to strange quark and the contribution coming from other partons is identically zero. As we know this naive picture breaks down due to complicated QCD effects of both perturbative and non-perturbative origins. Along this line of thought there has been an interesting work by Burkardt and Jaffe [formula] who have charted out an experimental programme to measure polarised u and d quark fragmentation functions in addition to s quark fragmentation function. The non-zero value for u and d quark fragmentation functions will invalidate the quark model picture. More recently the references [formula] discuss the importance of gluons in the polarised Λ production. The analysis in the reference [formula] is purely based on the AP evolution equations satisfied by the polarised fragmentation functions of quarks and gluons. It has been shown that the gluons play significant role when the scale at which the experiment is done is very high. In the massive gluon scheme, it has been demonstrated [\cite=RAV2] that the gluons contribute to polarised lambda production. Since the fragmentation functions are defined in this scheme, the gluonic contribution to polarised Λ is scheme dependent. The situation is very similar to the gluonic contribution to polarised structure function measured in DIS. This paper extends the previous analysis [\cite=RAV2] to include the Z boson exchange in order to completely extract various parton fragmentation functions.

The paper is organised as follows. In the second chapter we discuss the importance of polarised gluons in the Λ production using AP evolution equations. We then systematically compute the QCD corrections to the asymmetries defined below which are useful to extract various partonic contributions to the Λ production. The results are presented in the chapter 3. We finally conclude in the chapter 4. The appendix contains the relevant details of the results presented in the chapter 3.

The Q2 Evolution of the Polarised Fragmentation Functions

In the parton model, the production cross section for Λ with polarisation s in e- e+ scattering is related to that of a parton and the probability that the parton fragments into Λ. In other words,

[formula]

The left hand side is the hadronic cross section for the production of polarised Λ within a solid angle Ω with respect to the beam direction in e- e+ scattering. Here s, s' and λ are the helicities of Λ, electron and parton respectively. The Bjorken like variables x = 2pΛ.q / Q2 and y = 2pa.q / Q2 are scaling variables in the hadron and parton levels respectively with q2 = Q2, pΛ,pa and q being the momenta of produced hadron, parton and the intermediate vector boson(γ or Z) respectively. The production cross section for a parton with helicity λ (right hand side of the equation) is completely calculable in PQCD. On the other hand, the probability that a parton of helicity λ fragments into Λ of helicity s, DΛ(s)a(λ)(x / y,Q2), is not calculable due to non-perturbative mechanism involved in the fragmentation region. Hence, these fragmentation functions are just inputs of the model which can be extracted from the experiment. Though they are not calculable within the realm of PQCD, they are universal in the sense that they are process independent. More interestingly their evolution in terms of Q2 and x are completely governed by the well known Altarelli-Parisi evolution equations.

In the polarised experiments, the hadronic cross section is directly proportional to polarised parton fragmentation functions defined as

[formula]

Let us first analyse the Q2 evolution of these fragmentation functions using Altarelli-Parisi evolution equations. The evolution equations are well known and are given by

[formula]

[formula]

where t =  log (Q2  /  Λ2) and αs(t) is the strong coupling constant. Here, αs(t)ΔPab(y)dt is the probability density of finding a parton of type a at the scale t + dt with momentum fraction y inside the parton of type b at a scale t. The splitting functions are given by

[formula]

Here, C2(R) = (N2 - 1) / 2N, C2(G) = N and T(R) = f / 2 with N = 3 for SU(3) and f being the number of flavours [formula]. In the above equations, usual +   prescription has been used to regulate z  →  1 singularity. Notice that the above equations are similar to the AP equations satisfied by the polarised parton distribution functions but for the interchange in Δpqg and Δpgq. The reason for this is as follows: The emission of a quark(gluon) from a quark (gluon) only affects the probability of quark (gluon) fragmenting into hadron. Hence the splitting functions ΔPqq and ΔPgg are unaffected. On the other hand, the emission of a quark from a gluon changes the probability of the gluon fragmenting into hadron. Similarly, the emission of a gluon from a quark affects the probability of quark fragmenting into hadron. That is why, the splitting functions ΔPqg and ΔPgq are interchanged. As these equations can easily be solved in the Mellin space, we define

[formula]

The complete solution for the nth moment is not illuminating. Recall that the first moments of the polarised parton distributions are interesting as they are related to the spin content of the polarised hadron and the measurement of them will tell us how the hadron spin is shared among the partons. In the same spirit, we here look at the first moment of polarised parton fragmentation functions. The measurement of it for various hadrons will tell us how the parton helicity is distributed among the produced hadrons. But it is experimentally a hard task. From eqn.([\ref=apeqn]), we find that the first moment of the polarised gluon fragmentation function to order αs(t) satisfies a simple first order differential equation, that is

[formula]

where β0 = (11C2(G) - 4T(R)) / 12π. The solution to the above equation can be found very easily using renormalisation group(RG) equation for the QCD coupling constant,

[formula]

From eqns.([\ref=apg], [\ref=alrg]), we obtain an interesting behaviour of first moment of gluon fragmentation function: the product of the first moment of polarised gluon fragmentation function times the strong coupling constant is scale independent to order α2s(t),

[formula]

In other words, to order α2s(t), ΔDΛg increases as the scale t increases, i.e

[formula]

where K is some constant. It is worth recalling that the counter part of such a relation for polarised gluon distribution function exists and has opened up a better understanding of the spin structure of the proton [formula]. That is,

[formula]

where Δg(t) is the first moment of polarised gluon distribution function. From the above equation it is clear that polarised gluonic contribution to proton spin could be important at very high energies. But this equation does not say anything about the absolute value of gluonic contribution.

Now let us consider the first moment of the polarised quark fragmentation function into polarised hadron. From eqn.([\ref=apeqnq]), it turns out

[formula]

From eqns. ([\ref=aldg]) and ([\ref=aldq]), we find that ΔDΛqi(t) grows as t. This is to be compared with the first moment of the polarised quarks in polarised hadron which is scale independent.

Hence the relations(eqns.([\ref=aldg],[\ref=aldq])) suggest that at very high energies the polarised gluon fragmentation into polarised hadrons(say Λ) is as significant as polarised quark fragmentation. This point is very important when one is interested in the analysis of integrated asymmetries coming from various partons. Also the first moment of the fragmentation functions will tell us given a parton of definite polarisation, how much of its polarisation is transferred into the produced hadron. This is to be compared with the interpretation of the first moment of polarised parton distributions that it measures how much of hadron's(say proton's) helicity is shared by the parton. If we sum over all these contributions, it will turn out to be the helicity of the hadron. Similarly in the fragmentation sector if we sum over all the hadron fragmentation functions coming from a specific polarised parton with their appropriate polarisations then it will coincide with the polarisation of the parton.

Asymmetries

The analysis in the last chapter shows that the gluonic contribution to the polarised Λ is as important as the quark contribution. Hence the QCD corrections to the processes which involve the extraction of these fragmentation functions are important. Recently, Burkardt and Jaffe [formula] have discussed the method of extracting various polarised quark fragmentations to polarised Λ by measuring some specific asymmetries in both unpolarised and polarised e- e+ scattering experiments. As a preliminary effort, in the reference [formula], [formula] various QCD corrections are computed to the cross section asymmetry when there is no Z exchange (purely electromagnetic (em)). The factorisation of IR singularities has also been verified to order αs(Q2) [formula]. In the following, we compute the QCD corrections to those asymmetries (discussed by Burkardt and Jaffe) which involve both γ and Z vector bosons as intermediate particles.

The Unpolarised e- ~ e+  ~   Scattering

First we compute the following asymmetry [formula].

[formula]

In the above asymmetry the spins of the initial leptons are averaged. This asymmetry is identically zero when there is only γ exchange. At very high energies, the Z exchange is also possible. This will make the asymmetry non-zero thanks to parity violation. In the above equation Ω is the solid angle within which the produced parton fragments into Λ. The arrows in the parenthesis of Λ and the partons denote their helicities with respect to the beam direction. The scale Q2 is the invariant mass of the photon or Z produced(i.e.,q2 = Q2) at the e+ ~ e- vertex. The sum is taken over all the partons such as quarks, anti-quarks and gluons fragmenting into Λ. Recall that the kinematic scaling variables x and y are defined as x = 2pΛ.q / Q2 and y = 2pa.q / Q2 respectively. The parton level asymmetry given in the eqn.([\ref=DSC]) is factorisable as

[formula]

where D(I)(Q2) are propagators given by

[formula]

The tensors Tμνj are constructed by looking at the symmetry properties of the amplitudes for direct Z and γZ interference contributions. These two amplitudes are individually gauge invariant in the mass less limit as can be checked explicitly. Hence these tensors are parametrised as

[formula]

[formula]

The tensors proportional to qμ in T3 and T4 are immaterial as the leptonic tensors are individually gauge invariant. The leptonic tensors Lμν(I) can be easily workout and are found to be

[formula]

where

[formula]

with q1 and q2 being the momenta of incoming positron and electron respectively. Here α is the fine structure constant, ve and ae are the vector and axial vector couplings in the e+e-Z vertex and θW is the Weignberg angle[\cite=PDB]. It is clear from the above tensors that the terms proportional to qμ or qν in the tensors T3 and T4 when contracted with the leptonic tensors give zero contribution.

Substituting the tensors (eqn.([\ref=tengz])) and the leptonic tensors (eqn.([\ref=lepgz])) in the eqn.([\ref=GZ]), we obtain

[formula]

where the general form of Hai for i = 3,4 is given by

[formula]

and that of Ha1 is given by

[formula]

where, vq and aq are vector and axial vector couplings in qZ vertex [\cite=PDB]. The superscript in H denotes the origins of these contributions such viz, direct Z or the interference between γ and Z contributions. The contribution to H(I)ai can come from processes to lowest order (see fig.1)(α(0)s) in αs (no gluon emission) as well as from processes involving single gluon emission(see fig.2) and virtual contributions(see fig.3) to first order in αs. The evaluation of asymmetries to lowest order is very simple as it involves only two body phase space. When the gluon accompanies the quark and anti-quark pair, then the evaluation is cumbersome due to three body phase space integral. We have given below a simple looking formula to compute the three body phase space after performing most of the integrals using the delta functions. The H(I)ai  ~  s are related to the matrix elements as follows:

[formula]

where the projectors are given by

[formula]

The terms H(I)ai can be computed from the fig.2 and are found to be of the form

[formula]

where

[formula]

with i = 3,4 and ηq = 1 for quarks and - 1 for anti-quarks. The factor 3 appearing in the eqn.([\ref=HI]) is due to the number of colours. The functions Cai are computed in the appendix. As we have already mentioned the functions Cai to lowest order get contributions from the Z or the γZ decaying into a polarised quark and antiquark pair. This asymmetry is just proportional to δ(1 - y) but for charge and other group factors. To order αs, Cai  ~  s get contributions from two types of processes: 1. polarised quark or antiquark production with a real gluon emission and virtual gluon corrections to the quark and anti-quark(self energy and vertex corrections) 2. polarised gluon emission from unpolarised quark and anti-quark pair. These processes suffer Infrared(IR) divergences when masses of the quarks and gluons are taken to be zero. In order to regulate these divergences we give gluons a small mass mg and finally take the limit mg going to zero. We compute these cross sections in the limit pa.q and Q2 tending to infinity with their ratio fixed. This is analogous to DIS limit but the scaling variable here is inverse of the Bjorken scaling variable.

[formula]

Notice that the delta function is absent for gluons. The functions Cai for quarks are given below,

[formula]

Notice that the above expressions are well defined in soft limit. As is shown in the appendix, the soft singularities coming from real gluon emission diagrams are exactly cancelled by that coming from the virtual diagrams such as self energy and vertex corrections. The term log (m2g) purely comes from the collinear divergence which can not be avoided in the mass less limit. This ill defined term will finally be absorbed into the fragmentation functions at the level of Λ production cross section. Hence the fragmentation functions are defined in what is usually called the massive gluon scheme. Similarly for gluons we have

[formula]

The asymmetry given in the eqn.([\ref=DSC]) is expressed in terms of the C(I)ai  ~  s as

[formula]

where

[formula]

The χ1 and χ2 for Z propagator with finite width will be modified and are found in ref. [\cite=PDB] and the convolution of two functions [formula] means

[formula]

The Polarised e- ~ e+ Scattering

Now let us find out the following asymmetry [formula] where one of the initial leptons and the produced parton are polarised

[formula]

Following the similar procedure, we can decompose the parton level asymmetry in terms of leptonic(Lμν) and gauge invariant hadronic(Tμν)tensors as

[formula]

where the new D(γ)(Q2) = 1 / Q4. In the above equation, I = γ corresponds to the diagrams where only photons are intermediate vector bosons. This is the extra contribution which is absent in the previous asymmetry. This is possible because of the polarisation of initial lepton. This diagram is gauge invariant as it is. The diagrams for I = Z,γZ are discussed already. Notice that the diagrams are split in such a way that for each I the diagrams are individually gauge invariant, hence the simple tensor decomposition. The leptonic tensors [formula] for the polarised electron are found to be

[formula]

where lμν and μν are already given. Substituting the above leptonic tensors in eqn.([\ref=GGZ]) we find,

[formula]

The general form of [formula] is found to be

[formula]

The functions H(I)ai for i = 1,3,4 are given in the eqns.([\ref=HI]). The new [formula] is given by

[formula]

Substituting eqn.([\ref=DSE]) in eqn.([\ref=DSG]) and using the eqns.([\ref=HDA],[\ref=NHG],[\ref=HI],[\ref=CI]) we find

[formula]

From the eqns.([\ref=asymone], [\ref=asymtwo]) we find that the asymmetries reduce to those given Burkardt and Jaffe(BJ)'s paper [formula] when we put the strong coupling constant αs(Q2) equal to zero confirming the correctness of our results presented in this paper. Also, we can reproduce the results for the asymmetries in the absence of Z exchange diagrams by putting both χ1 and χ2 equal to zero. Hence our results presented here are consistent with BJ asymmetries. The extraction of both quark and gluons now becomes complicated because of the presense of gluonic fragmentation functions. Notice that the expressions (eqns. ([\ref=asymone]), ([\ref=asymtwo])) look very similar to that of BJ asymmetries with the replacement of quark and antiquark fragmentation functions by the parton fragmentation functions convoluted with complicated looking functions Cai. This simple fact that the structures are identical might help us in the extraction of the combination of fragmentation functions with Cai instead of just the fragmentation functions. From this combination and an independent measurement on polarised gluonic contribution one should be able to disentangle both the quark and gluon fragmentation functions. Once these functions are measured in the laboratory, these have nice physical interpretation that their first moments will tell us the polarisation contribution coming from various partons to a specific hadron in the sense described earlier. As is seen from the analysis of Q2 evolutions of these fragmentation functions using AP evolution equations, the first moment of quark and gluon fragmentation functions will play a crucial role at high energies in the production of polarised Λ hyperons at e- ~ e+ annihilation processes.

Conclusion

In this paper we have extensively studied the polarised Λ production in e+ ~ e- annihilation process. This involves the measurement of what are called polarised fragmentation functions of quarks and gluons into polarised Λ. The extraction of the fragmentation functions of different flavours is very complicated due to the charge factors multipling them. Burkardt and Jaffe were successful in disentangling these distributions by looking at various asymmetries at different kinematical regions. In this paper, using the Altarelli-Parisi evolution equation, we have shown that the polarised gluon fragmentation is also important when one is interested in finding spin or helicity coming from various partons to the produced polarised Λ. In fact we find that the first moment of the polarised gluon fragmentation is logarithmically raising as Q2 increases. So at high energies gluons play crucial role invalidating the naive expectations based on simple coupling constant arguments. This is similar to the behaviour one encounters in the study of spin content of the proton or any hadron. In fact the behaviour in the fragmentation sector is much more stronger than that in the structure function sector due to the vanishing of first moment of ΔPqg(x). Since the gluons can contribute only from order αs(Q2), we have considered the full QCD corrections to the asymmetries discussed earlier. This of course, further complicates the extraction procedure. The phenomenological implications of these QCD corrections and the extraction of gluonic fragmentation function are under investigation. It is worth to recollect the status of gluonic contribution to polarised structure function measured in DIS experiments. The status here is very similar to that in DIS due to the scheme dependence of these gluonic contributions. Hence, a scheme independent measurement of polarised gluonic fragmentation function would substantiate our analysis. The extraction of these distribution is very important primarily due to two reasons. One of them is that this might tell more about quark and gluon dynamics in the fragmentation sector. Particularly, the measurement of non strange quark contributions to polarised Λ production will be a test of existing models for polarised Λ fragmentation. Also, the importance of polarised gluons in the Λ production can be experimentally tested.

Matrix Elements and Integrals

In this appendix we outline the evaluation H(I)ai in the massive gluon scheme. We have split the amplitude into three parts. That is, 1. γ  →  qg, 2. Z  →  qg and 3. the interference of γ and Z initiated processes. All three are independently gauge invariant.

Let us first consider γ  →  qg process. If the quark is polarised then there will be virtual contributions due to gluons in addition to gluon emission diagrams. These diagrams are both soft and collinear divergent. In addition, the virtual diagrams are ultraviolet divergent(UV). The soft and collinear divergences are regulated by giving a small mass to the gluon. The UV divergence is regulated using Pauli-Villars regularisation.

To produce polarised quark, unpolarised anti-quark and gluon the initial virtual photon should be polarised, otherwise the amplitude is identically zero. We project out this contribution as

[formula]

where the momenta of the particles are given in the fig.2, the Mandelstam variables are s = (p1 + p3)2,t = (p2 + p3)2 and u = (p1 + p2)2 satisfying s + t + u = Q2 + m2g. Here,

[formula]

The processes involving only Z particles are given in the fig.2. Due to the axial coupling in addition to the vector coupling, polarised particles can be produced from the virtual Z decay even if one sums the polarisations of Z unlike the case of γ. Hence we project out the following contributions from the matrix element when the quark is polarised:

[formula]

[formula]

Here Mq1 is already given in the eqn.([\ref=M1]).

Next we compute the interference term coming from Z and γ decaying into polarised quark, anti-quark and gluon

[formula]

Noting that s = Q2(1 - x2) and t = Q2(1 - x1) where xi = 2pi.q / Q2 the relevant integrals are presented below

[formula]

The virtual contributions can be computed from the diagrams given in the fig.3. Here we state the expressions for the amplitudes involving self energy correction and vertex correction (for general vertex of the type (a + bγ5)γμ). Both diagrams(self energy and vertex correction) in fig.3 are UV divergent separately. As we have already mentioned, we regulate these UV divergences in Pauli-Villars regularisation scheme. They also suffer from soft divergences when we set all the masses to be zero. Here also, we give a small mass to the gluon to regulate them. The amplitude for the self energy insertion after properly taking care of wave function renormalisation turns out to be(self energies for both quark and antiquark)

[formula]

where L is the Pauli-Villars regulator to regulate the UV divergence. s and s' are the polarisations of quark and antiquark respectively.

Similarly the amplitude for the vertex correction turns out to be

[formula]

Though the above amplitudes suffer from UV divergence, when we sum these two amplitudes, we find that the UV regulator cancels between self energy and vertex corrections, thanks to Ward identity.

Now let us find out the projected matrix elements similar to eqns.([\ref=M1]), ([\ref=Mq]) when the gluon is polarised and quark and antiquarks are unpolarised. We here list Mgi analogous to Mqi (with p2 replaced by p3)

[formula]

Where η = 1 for γ or Z diagrams and η = 2 for γZ interference terms. We find that the results given in eqn. ([\ref=glco]) can be got by integrating the above matrix elements with respect to x2. The integrations of the matrix elements MgG and MgP are identically zero in the limit mg taken to be zero.
