INTRODUCTION

The study of finite temperature QCD with Wilson-type quarks is desirable in order to estimate any systematic errors of similar simulations with Kogut-Susskind quarks. However, Wilson thermodynamics has proved to be difficult and burdened with lattice artifacts [\cite=ref:UKAWA]. It is plausible that an action which converges to the continuum action faster in the a  →  0 limit would be cured of such spurious effects.

ACTION

For the gauge action, we start with the one loop, on-shell Symanzik improved action derived by Lüscher and Weisz [\cite=ref:LW]. We implement the tadpole improvement scheme in order that lattice perturbation theory be more convergent [\cite=ref:LM] [\cite=ref:ALFORD]. We choose to define the "mean link" u0 and the strong coupling constant αs through the plaquette [\cite=ref:LM] [\cite=ref:ALFORD] [\cite=ref:WW]:

The coefficients of the rectangle operator and the twisted 6-link operator, βrect and βtwist respectively, are given in terms of the coefficient of the plaquette β and u0 as in [\cite=ref:ALFORD]:

[formula]

In practice, we estimate u0 in a self-consistent manner: we tune it so that it agrees with the fourth root of the space-like plaquettes.

The Wilson fermion action has errors of O(a). The Symanzik improvement program is used to improve the action [\cite=ref:SW]. After tadpole improvement the fermion action is

where SW is the usual Wilson fermion action, and iFμν is the familiar clover-shaped link operator.

RESULTS

Our thermodynamics simulations were done on an 83  ×  4 lattice at six fixed values of β while varying κ across the thermal crossover (tuning u0 self-consistently at each parameter set). We used the hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm and collected data from at least 1000 trajectories for the simulations in the crossover region. Furthermore, zero temperature simulations on an 83  ×  16 lattice were performed in order to provide hadron masses in the region of the thermal crossover line. The phase diagram (figure [\ref=fig:phase]) summarizes our run parameters.

Figure [\ref=fig:pl_vs_k] shows the Polyakov loop as a function of κ for the six values of β. One can observe that the transition appears steeper for stronger coupling: a feature also present in Nt = 4 Wilson thermodynamics [\cite=ref:MILC4]. Still, the crossover for the improved action does not appear to be as steep as for the unimproved action.

One would like to make direct comparison between the two actions of their respective crossover behavior without depending on the bare parameters. In this work, we use measurements of the lattice pion mass squared at values of κ near the crossover. Then, we can plausibly overlay curves of thermodynamic observables for two actions run at comparable mπ / mρ. Below we list mπ / mρ along the Nt = 4 crossover for both clover and Wilson [\cite=ref:HEMCGC] actions.

Using measurements of the pion mass near the crossover region [\cite=ref:SCRI], we can interpolate in order to estimate (amπ)2 as a function of 1 / κ. Then, we can plot the thermodynamic observables against the pion mass squared. This shows that the crossover is indeed smoother for Nt = 4 clover than Nt = 4 Wilson (see figure [\ref=fig:pl_vs_mpisq]).

Finally, the confinement-deconfinement temperatures for different two-flavor lattice actions are shown in figure [\ref=fig:tc_over_mrho]. One consequence of our improvement scheme is to lower the Wilson Nt = 4 critical temperature at a given mass ratio. This brings the calculation of Tc / mρ into better agreement with Nt = 6 Wilson and with staggered fermion thermodynamics. There is one important caveat: we do not yet know if the clover simulations have reached a plateau in mπ / mρ. If Tc / mρ continues to rise at lower mπ / mρ (lower β) then the aforementioned agreement is accidental. Furthermore, we should remember that Tc / mρ tends toward zero as mπ / mρ approaches unity, i.e. as mq  →    ∞  . Measurements of the string tension will provide a scale which is insensitive to the quark mass.

CONCLUSIONS

We have shown that the Nt  =  4 thermal crossover is smoother for the Symanzik-improved action. It could be that Tc / mρ is in better agreement with staggered fermion results; however running at the thermal crossover at lower mπ / mρ is needed to confirm this.
