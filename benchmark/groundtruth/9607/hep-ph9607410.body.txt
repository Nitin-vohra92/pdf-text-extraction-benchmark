INTRODUCTION

Deep inelastic electroproduction of heavy flavours is given by

[formula]

When the virtuality [formula] of the exchanged vector bosons is not too large ( Q2  ≪  M2Z ) the above reaction only gets a contribution from the virtual photon and we can neglect any weak effects caused by the exchange of the Z-boson. If the process is inclusive with respect to the hadronic state 'X' as well as the heavy flavours Q(), the unpolarized cross section is given by

[formula]

where S denotes the square of the c.m. energy of the electron proton system and the variables x and y are defined as

[formula]

In the QCD improved parton model the heavy flavour contribution to the hadronic structure functions, denoted by Fi(x,Q2,m2) (i = 2,L), where m stands for the heavy quark mass, can be expressed as integrals over the partonic scaling variable. This yields the following results

[formula]

where z = Q2 / (s + Q2) and s is the square of the photon-parton centre-of-mass energy (s  ≥  4m2). Here the upper boundary of the integration is given by zmax  =  Q2 / (4m2  +  Q2).

The function G(z,μ2) stands for the gluon density whereas the flavour singlet and flavour non-singlet combinations of the quark densities are given by Σ(z,μ2) and Δ(z,μ2) respectively. In the above expressions the charges of the light quark and the heavy quark are denoted by ei and eH respectively. Furthermore, nf stands for the number of light quarks and μ denotes the mass factorization scale, which we choose to be equal to the renormalization scale. The latter shows up in the running coupling constant defined by αs(μ2). The heavy quark coefficient functions are denoted by Li,j and Hi,j (i = 2,L; j = q,g). The distinction between them can be traced back to the different photon-parton production processes from which they originate. The functions Li,j are attributed to the reactions where the virtual photon couples to the light quark, whereas the Hi,j originate from the reactions where the virtual photon couples to the heavy quark. Hence Li,j and Hi,j in (5) are multiplied by e2i and e2Q respectively. The superscripts NS and S on the heavy quark coefficient functions refer to flavour non-singlet and flavour singlet respectively. Furthermore the singlet quark coefficient functions LSi,q and HSi,q can be split into non-singlet and purely singlet (PS) parts,i.e.,

with HNSi,q = 0 in all orders of perturbation theory.

In [\cite=lrsn1] the heavy quark coefficient functions Li,j and Hi,j have been exactly calculated up to α2s. Expanding them in a power series in (αs / 4π)k they receive contributions from the following parton subprocesses

For reaction (9) one has to include the virtual gluon corrections to the Born process (8). The contributions from (8) and (9) to the heavy quark coefficient functions are denoted by H(1)i,g and H(2)i,g respectively. The parton subprocess (10) has two different production mechanisms. The first one is given by the Bethe-Heitler process (see figs. 5a,5b in [\cite=lrsn1]) leading to HPS,(2)i,q and the second one can be attributed to the Compton reaction (see figs. 5c,5d in [\cite=lrsn1]). Notice that LPSi,q and LSi,g are zero through order α2s. Then, from (6), one infers that LNS,(2)i,q  =  LS,(2)i,q. Finally we want to make the remark that there are no interference terms between the Bethe-Heitler and the Compton reactions in (10) if one integrates over all final state momenta.

The complexity of the second order heavy quark coefficient functions prohibits publishing them in an analytic form, except for LNS,(2)i,q, which is given in Appendix A of [\cite=bmsmn], so that they are only available in large computer programs [\cite=lrsn1], involving two-dimensional integrations. To shorten the long running time needed for the computation of the structure functions in (5) we have tabulated the coefficient functions in the form of a two dimensional array in the variables η and ξ in a different computer program [\cite=rsn1]. These variables are defined by

[formula]

However when ξ  ≫  1 (Q2  ≫  m2) numerical instabilities appear so that it is desirable to have analytic expressions for the heavy quark coefficient functions in that region. Moreover it turns out that for ξ  >  10 the asymptotic expressions for H(2)2,g (9) and HPS,(2)2,q (10) approach the exact ones so that the former can be used for charm production at the HERA collidier provided Q2  >  22.5 (GeV / c2) (mc  =  1.5 (GeV / c). Furthermore one can use these asymptotic formulae in the context of the variable flavour number scheme as has been explained in [\cite=aot].

METHOD

We will now explain how the asymptotic form (Q2  ≫  m2) of the heavy quark coefficient functions Hi,j , Li,j (5) can be derived using the renormalization group and the operator product expansion (OPE) techniques. Using these techniques one can avoid the computation of the cumbersome Feynman integrals and phase space integrals which arise in the calculation of the processes in (8) - (10). In the limit Q2  ≫  m2 the heavy quark coefficient functions behave logarithmically as

[formula]

with a similar expression for L(k)i,j. The above large logarithms originate from collinear divergences which arise when Q2 is kept fixed and m2  →  0. As has been shown in [\cite=bmsmn] each fixed order term in expression (12) can be written as

[formula]

where the power of αs has to match on the left and right hand sides. There is a similar expression for Li,j (i = 2,L; k,j  =  q,g). Notice that we have suppressed the dependence on the scaling variable z in (12) and the convolution symbol [formula] is defined by

[formula]

The light quark and gluon coefficient functions Ci,k have been calculated up to order α2s in [\cite=zn]. The operator matrix elements (OME's) Akj are now also known up to the same order in perturbation theory (see [\cite=bmsmn]). They are defined by

[formula]

where Ok represent the local operators which show up in the operator product expansion of the two electromagnetic currents which appear in the calculation of the process (1). Notice that the OME's in (15) are finite which means that all renormalizations and mass factorizations have already been carried out. The last operation is needed because of the collinear divergences which appear in the OME's when the external on-mass-shell massless quarks and gluons are coupled to internal massless quanta. The ultraviolet and collinear divergences are regulated by using the method of n-dimensional regularization. The removal of these divergences has been done in the [formula]-scheme. For the computation of the heavy quark coefficient functions H(1)i,g (8) H(2)i,g (9) we need the OME's A(1)Qg and A(2)Qg respectively, which are given by the Feynman graphs in figs.1,2 of [\cite=bmsmn]. The Bethe-Heitler coefficient functions HPS,(2)i,q (10) requires the calculation of APS,(2)Qq whereas for the Compton coefficient function LNS,(2)Qq (10) one has to compute ANS,(2)qq The results for these OME's can be found in appendix C of [\cite=bmsmn]. Substitution of Akj and Ci,k in (13) leads to the asymptotic heavy quark coefficient functions which are presented in Appendix D of [\cite=bmsmn].

RESULTS

We are now interested to find out at which values of ξ (11) or Q2 the asymptotic coefficient functions approach the exact ones computed in [\cite=lrsn1] and [\cite=rsn1]. For that purpose we define the ratio [formula] which is given by

[formula]

where Hexacti,j and Hasympi,j stand for the exact [\cite=lrsn1], [\cite=rsn1] and asymptotic [\cite=bmsmn] heavy quark coefficient functions respectively. Choosing μ2  =  m2 and the range 5  <  ξ  <  105, we have plotted as an example R(2)L,g in fig.1 and R(2)2,g in fig.2 for z  =  10- 2 and z = 10- 4. The reason that we have chosen these two ratios is that the coefficient functions H(2)L,g and H(2)2,g (9) constitute the bulk of the radiative corrections to the Born reaction (8). From fig.1 we infer that Hexact,(2)L,g and Hasymp,(2)L,g coincide when ξ  ≥  ξ min  =  103 and there is essentially no difference between the ratios for z = 10- 2 and z  =  10- 4. In the case of Hexact,(2)2,g and Hasymp,(2)2,g (see fig.2) the above ξ-value is much smaller and both coefficient functions coincide when ξ  ≥  ξ min = 10, which is quite insensitive to the values chosen for z. The reason why the convergence of R(2)L,g to one is so slow in comparison to R(2)2,g is unclear. Apparently the logarithmic terms in Hexact,(2)L,g start to dominate the coefficient functions at much larger values of ξ than is the case for Hexact,(2)2,g. A similar observation has been made for HPS,(2)i,q. The small value found for ξ min in the case of H2,g is very interesting for charm production where F2(x,Q2,m2c) can be measured with much higher accuracy than FL(x,Q2,m2). Since H(2)2,g dominates the radiative corrections to F2(x,Q2,m2c) one can state that for Q2  >  22.5 (GeV / c)2 (mc  =  1.5 GeV / c) the exact coefficient functions can be replaced by their asymptotic ones. However before one can draw definite conclusions about the dominance of the terms ln l(Q2 / m2) on the level of the structure functions ones first to convolute the heavy quark coefficient functions with the parton densities  (see (5) ). This will be done in future work. If it turns out that the above logarithms also dominate Fk(x,Q2,m2), in particular for k = 2, then these terms have to be resummed using the renormalization group equations. This is done using the variable flavour number scheme approach [\cite=aot]. One of the features of this method is that one has to define a charm density in the proton which is a convolution of the OME's Ak,j (15) and the light parton densities Σ and G in (5). Hence for Q2 >  > m2c the charm quark behaves like a light parton provided the large logarithmic terms dominate the proton structure functions in (5).
