We study multivariable (bilateral) basic hypergeometric series associated with (type A) Macdonald polynomials. We derive several transformation and summation properties for such series including analogues of Heine's [formula] transformation, the q-Pfaff-Kummer and Euler transformations, the q-Saalschütz summation formula and Sear's transformation for terminating, balanced [formula] series. For bilateral series, we rederive Kaneko's analogue of the [formula] summation formula and give multivariable extensions of Bailey's [formula] transformations.

Dedicated to Dick Askey on the occasion of his 65'th birthday.

Introduction

Multivariable basic hypergeometric series of the type studied in this paper were first introduced by Kaneko and Macdonald [\cite=kaneko96a] [\cite=macunp1]. They are defined as

[formula]

where all quantities are defined in Section [\ref=two].

The q = 1 case had been studied previously by Yan [\cite=yan92b] where several important properties of the hypergeometric series [formula] were studied including the Gauss ([formula]) and Kummer ([formula]) summation formulae, the Pfaff-Kummer and Euler transformations and integral representations were derived (see also [\cite=opdam93a] for the Gauss formula with respect to arbitrary root systems).

Kaneko [\cite=kaneko96a] considered a generalized q-Selberg integral dependent on parameters [formula] and derived a set of m q-difference equations satisfied by such an integral. He then showed that the basic hypergeometric series [formula] defined by ([\ref=basic.def]) was the unique solution (satisfying certain properties) of such a system. He was thus able to derive an integral representation for this [formula] series and hence give an alternative proof of the q-Selberg integral [\cite=askey80a] (see also [\cite=kad88a] [\cite=zeil89a] [\cite=kad94a]). He additionally derived the q-analogue of the Gauss formula and another integral formula, the constant term version of which was presented in [\cite=kaneko97b]. In a subsequent work [\cite=kaneko97a], Kaneko introduced a multivariable analogue of the bilateral basic hypergeometric series [formula] and derived an analogue of Ramanujan's [formula] summation formula, along with a multivariable version of the Jacobi triple product identity (which is a limiting case - see also [\cite=kaneko96b]).

Independently, Macdonald in his unpublished notes [\cite=macunp1] carried out (among other things) a similar program to Yan in the q = 1 case along with a multivariable version of the Saalschütz summation formula (the summation of a balanced [formula] with unit argument), while for general q he derived the integral representation for the [formula] series, and q-analogues of the Gauss and Saalschütz formulae.

The aim of the present work is to supplement some of the existing knowledge with some new transformation and summation formulae in this multivariable setting (including the q-analogue of the Pfaff-Kummer transformation formulae, Heine's transformation formula for the [formula] series, Sear's transformation for terminating, balanced [formula] series, and various summation and transformation formulae for bilateral [formula] series), as well as providing alternative derivations of known results. For a comprehensive review of summation and transformation formulae for basic hypergeometric series in the one-variable case see Gasper and Rahmen's book [\cite=gasperbk].

We note here that many of the summation and transformation formulae involving multivariable basic hypergeometric series are only valid when the argument is specialized to [formula] (the exceptions being the q-binomial theorem, the Euler transformation of the [formula] series and the [formula] summation formula).

Finally, we point out that many of the formulae presented here can be derived in the case q = t (the Schur polynomial case) as special cases of the very general formulae of Milne and co-workers (see [\cite=miln97a] and referenced therein), or from those found in the works of Krattenthaler, Gustafson and Schlosser [\cite=krat97a] [\cite=schloss96a]. Also, summation formulae for hypergeometric systems associated with the BC root system have been considered by Van Diejen [\cite=vandiej97a] (see also [\cite=vandiej97b]).

The plan of the paper is as follows. In Section 1 we set out the basic facts about Macdonald polynomials we shall require. Section 2 exhibits a multivariable extension of Heine's [formula] transformations. The Euler transformation is derived in Section 3 from the defining difference equations for the [formula] series. Section 4 treats the q-Saalschütz formula while the q-Pfaff-Kummer transformation for [formula] and Sear's transformation for terminating, balanced [formula] series are discussed in Section 5. Bilateral series are studied in Section 6 where the [formula] summation formula is derived using a shifted version of the multivariable Gauss summation formula, and various [formula] transformations are derived using two different methods.

Notations

The Macdonald polynomials Pλ(x;q,t), [formula] (often abbreviated to Pλ(x) or just Pλ when the context is clear) are defined as the unique symmetric polynomials having the expansion

[formula]

(where <   denotes the dominance order on partitions and mλ(x) denotes the monomial symmetric function), which form an orthogonal basis of symmetric functions with respect to the inner product

[formula]

where

[formula]

Here C.T. stand for "the constant term of" in the case where t = qk (and hence the quantity in brackets in ([\ref=inner]) is a Laurent polynomial) or the corresponding trigonometric integral otherwise, and

[formula]

Define the following quantities

[formula]

where a(s) (respectively l(s)) denotes the arm-length (resp. leg-length) of the node s in the diagram of λ, along with the generalized shifted q-factorial [formula]. Here [formula]. Two fundamental results of Macdonald polynomials we shall use, both of which can be found in [\cite=mac], is their specialization formula

[formula]

and their normalization with respect to the inner product ([\ref=inner])

[formula]

where

[formula]

Further, following Macdonald [\cite=mac], for a partition λ, let uλ denote the evaluation map on polynomials in n variables which sets xi = qλitn - i. There are no nice expressions for uλ(Pμ) except in the cases λ = 0 (since [formula] given above in ([\ref=eval])) or more generally λ = (mn) (since u(mn)(Pμ)  =  qmu0(Pμ)). Nonetheless, there is a useful symmetry property for uλ(Pμ) in general, which reads

[formula]

One of the fundamental results in the theory of basic hypergeometri series is the summation formula for a [formula] series, also known as the q-binomial theorem

[formula]

This has the following important generalization (see e.g. [\cite=kaneko96a])

[formula]

which will often be of use below.

Heine's transformation formula

A fundamental transformation formula for [formula] series is Heine's transformation formula

[formula]

The utility of this formula is two-fold: iterate it twice to get the Euler transformation formula (see ([\ref=euler.1]); set z = c / ab and the [formula] on the right hand side of ([\ref=heine.1]) becomes a [formula] which can be summed by the q-binomial theorem resulting in Gauss's summation formula

[formula]

The multivariable version of Heine's formula appears as follows

[formula]

(as mentioned in the introduction, the notation ztδ stands for the argument [formula]). The proof of this identity follows in the same manner as the one-variable case, with the aid of the symmetry property ([\ref=symm.mac]). To see this, first note that setting zi = bt1 - iqλi and a = c / b in the q-binomial theorem ([\ref=q.bin]) yields

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

which gives the result. Here we have used ([\ref=dokusho]), ([\ref=symm.mac]) and ([\ref=dokusho]) respectively.

As mentioned above, upon setting z = c / (abtn - 1) the r.h.s. of ([\ref=heine.n]) reduces to a [formula] which can be summed through the q-binomial theorem giving Gauss's formula

[formula]

Also, we can iterate ([\ref=heine.n]) twice and obtain a version of Euler's transformation valid for the variables ztδ. In fact, we shall see in the next section that there exists a multivariable version of the Euler transformation, which is true for general argument [formula].

Euler transformation

In the theory of the one-variable q-hypergeometric function [formula], the Euler transformation reads

[formula]

This transformation generalizes naturally to the n-variable case.

With [formula] defined by ([\ref=basic.def]), we have

[formula]

The n-variable Euler transformation ([\ref=euler.2]) can be proved by using a theorem of Kaneko [\cite=kaneko96a] which characterizes [formula] as the unique solution of a system of q-difference equations. To state these equations, let τi denote the q-shift operator for the variable zi so that [formula], write

[formula]

and define the q-derivative by

[formula]

(Kaneko) The multivariable basic q-hypergeometric series [formula] as defined by ([\ref=basic.def]) is the unique solution of the system of q-difference equations

[formula]

subject to the conditions that S(z) is a symmetric function in [formula] and S(z) is analytic at the origin with S(0) = 1.

In light of Theorem [\ref=thm.k], the Euler transformation ([\ref=euler.2]) can be proved by verifying that the substitution

[formula]

into the q-difference equation ([\ref=qdif]) implies that U satisfies the same q-difference equation ([\ref=qdif]) with the replacements

[formula]

To perform this task we will require the q-differentiation product rule

[formula]

as well as the special summation formula [\cite=kaneko96a]

[formula]

Proof of Proposition 3.1 Let us now give some details of the required calculation. With

[formula]

straightforward use of ([\ref=qder]) and ([\ref=pr]) shows that

[formula]

Double use of ([\ref=1.one]) allows us to write down a similar formula for

[formula]

Next we use these formulas to rewrite the derivatives in ([\ref=qdif]) with [formula], and proceed to collect together terms so that the essential structure of ([\ref=qdif]) is maintained. Thus, for example, we must collect together all terms proportional to U, and show that apart from a common factor (which is eventually canceled out) the coefficient of S in ([\ref=qdif]), with the substitutions ([\ref=replace]), results. These terms are

[formula]

Noting that

[formula]

we see that the summation can be evaluated according to ([\ref=sum]). The expression ([\ref=U]) then greatly simplifies, reducing down to

[formula]

The factor in the curly brackets is precisely what is required to obtain ([\ref=qdif]) with the replacements ([\ref=replace]).

Similar calculations to simplify the terms proportional to the q-derivatives show that the precise q-difference equation ([\ref=qdif]) results with S = U and the replacements ([\ref=replace]); the term in the parenthesis in ([\ref=F]) is a common factor which cancels out. [formula]

q-Saalschütz summation formula

A summation formula for basic hypergeometric series used in many contexts is the sum of a terminating balanced [formula] series (q-Saalschütz formula)

[formula]

This formula follows directly by comparing coefficients of zN on both sides of the Euler transformation formula ([\ref=euler.1]) (the products being expanded with the q-binomial theorem). This can be generalized to a multi-variable setting following the proof of Macdonald [\cite=macunp1] in the q = 1 case. First, we need some preliminary results.

Given a partition λ of length [formula] let λ̂ to be the complement of λ in the rectangle (Nn). That is, λ̂i  =  N  -  λn + 1 - i. Then it follows from the various definitions that

[formula]

Next, let fλμν(q,t) denote the coefficient of Pλ in the expansion of Pμ  Pν. The following result is due to Macdonald [\cite=macunp1] but we include the proof for completeness,

We have

[formula]

Proof.  Writing [formula], first note that

[formula]

which follows from the characterization of the Macdonald polynomials explained in Section [\ref=two] (clearly both sides of the above equation have leading order term mλ̂(x) and also [formula], yielding the requisite orthogonality - see also [\cite=vandiej97b] on this point). It thus follows from ([\ref=sombrero]) that

[formula]

The result now follows from the orthogonality of Macdonald polynomials and the expression ([\ref=norm]) for their normalization. [formula]

The last ingredient needed is the following expression for h'λ due to Kaneko [\cite=kaneko96b]

[formula]

from which one obtains a relation we shall need presently

[formula]

Beginning with the Euler transformation formula ([\ref=euler.2]), expand the products occurring there with the q-binomial theorem and compare coefficients of Pλ(z) on both sides to obtain

[formula]

The point here is that in the case when λ = (Nn), the sum on the right hand side can be expressed as a balanced [formula] series (the series [formula] in ([\ref=basic.def]) is said to be balanced if [formula]). Indeed after using the expression ([\ref=imoto]) for f(Nn)μν and expressing all quantities labelled by [formula] in terms of those of μ by means of ([\ref=ototo]) and ([\ref=shumi]) the resulting sum over μ can be simplified to yield

[formula]

which is a multivariable version of the q-Saalschütz formula.

Note that by taking the limit a  →  0 in ([\ref=saal.n]) using the fact that lim x  →    ∞(x)μ / x|μ|  =  ( - 1)|μ|qn(μ'), we have (after shifting b  →  c / b)

[formula]

which is a generalization of the Chu-Vandermonde formula (especially in the case λ  =  (Nn) when the right hand side can be expressed as a terminating [formula]) we shall have subsequent need for.

Other transformation formulae

One of the simplest transformations where the simple n = 1 proof must be rethought is the Pfaff-Kummer transformation

[formula]

This is a q-analogue of the classical relation

[formula]

Indeed, it can be shown using the [formula] integral representation [\cite=macunp1] or the defining set of m partial differential equations [\cite=yan92b] [\cite=kaneko93a] that the multivariable analogue of ([\ref=kumm]) holds in its full generality:

[formula]

This is not possible in the multivariable version of ([\ref=kumm.q]); however for the restricted argument ztδ, such a formula can be derived via a suitable modification of the argument in [\cite=gasperbk].

The key step is to establish the identity

[formula]

for then it follows from the Chu-Vandermonde formula ([\ref=chu]) that

[formula]

which is the multi-variable version of the Pfaff-Kummer transformation formula. It thus remains to prove ([\ref=chichi]). This identity is in fact a special case of the more general identity

[formula]

provided b = aczxtn - 1.

Proof.  Let S denote the summation side of the above equation. Note from the definition of the generalized q-factorials and the q-binomial theorem we can write

[formula]

It follows that

[formula]

where we have also used the symmetry property ([\ref=symm.mac]) for Macdonald polynomials. Now, from the definition of the coefficients fμλσ(q,t) and the q-binomial theorem it also follows that

[formula]

Using this result in ([\ref=pana]) gives

[formula]

where again, we have used the symmetry property ([\ref=symm.mac]). The crucial point now is that if b = aczxtn - 1, then the sum over τ can be carried out using the q-binomial theorem again, viz.

[formula]

Using this in ([\ref=palta]) gives the required result. [formula] Remarks 1. When λ = 0 this identity reduces to Gauss's formula ([\ref=gauss.n]), and can thus be considered a "shifted" version of Gauss's theorem. 2. The identity ([\ref=chichi]) is simply the case b = c = 0, x = 1 of the above lemma.

Sear's [formula] transformation

A final application of the q-Saalschütz formulae ([\ref=saal.n]) and ([\ref=saal.n2]) is in deriving a multivariable analogue of Sear's transformation of a terminating, balanced [formula] series (see [\cite=gasperbk]. Following the proof given in [\cite=gasperbk], it suffices to write the product of two specific [formula] series in two different ways and compare coefficients of the Macdonald polynomial P(Nn)(z) in each case. Indeed, the coefficient of P(Nn)(z) in the product

[formula]

can been seen to be

[formula]

where one must use the expression for f(Nn)μν(q,t) given in ([\ref=imoto]), along with ([\ref=ototo]) and ([\ref=shumi]). On the other hand we have by Euler's transformation ([\ref=euler.2])

[formula]

Expanding this using the q-binomial theorem and then examining the coefficient of P(Nn)(z), it follows from use of ([\ref=imoto]), ([\ref=saal.n]), ([\ref=ototo]) and ([\ref=shumi]) that the coefficient of P(Nn)(z) in ([\ref=happy]) is

[formula]

Comparing ([\ref=buscar.1]), ([\ref=buscar.2]), yields the multivariable analogue of Sear's transformation

[formula]

Bilateral series

We now turn our attention to bilateral basic hypergeometric series. The key point is that by using the following property of the Macdonald polynomials [\cite=mac]

[formula]

where [formula], one can define Macdonald polynomials for all n-tuples λ with [formula] with [formula]. namely if λn < 0 then Pλ(x)  =  |x|λn  Pλ  -  λn(x). Denote the set of such partitions as P and those with non-negative entries as P+.

It also follows from ([\ref=shift]) and the definition of the inner product on the space of Macdonald polynomials that for any λ∈P+ and any a we have [formula] and it follows that we can extend the definition of the inner product to polynomials Pλ for all λ∈P, and that they remain orthogonal viz,

[formula]

Following Kaneko [\cite=kaneko97a], define the multivariable bilateral hypergoemetric series by

[formula]

For λn < 0, the above factorial symbols (a)λ must be interpreted according to

[formula]

and h'λ is interpreted according to ([\ref=lapiz]).

Kaneko's [formula] summation formula

In [\cite=kaneko97a], Kaneko gave a simple argument for the summation of a [formula] series. Here we give an alternative proof following Andrew's argument in the one-variable case [\cite=andr69a] which uses Gauss's theorem.

For |b / a| < |xi| < 1 for all [formula] we have

[formula]

Proof.   We have from the q-binomial theorem that

[formula]

We need to expand Pσ(x- 1)Pμ(x) in terms of Macdonald polynomials. Suppose

[formula]

From the orthogonality of {Pλ}λ∈P we have that

[formula]

Since both σ and ν  -  νn∈P+, then dνσμ is non-zero only for all μ such that μ  -  νn∈P+. Thus

[formula]

Thus we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

We now observe that we can use Lemma [\ref=gauss.shift] to sum the above expression yielding

[formula]

Clearly Bν = 0 when νn < 0. In the cases when νn  ≥  0 (i.e. ν∈P+) it follows after some manipulations that

[formula]

Substituting back into ([\ref=calor]) and using the q-binomial theorem gives the result. [formula]

[formula] transformations

Our final application of the theory of Macdonald polynomials will be to transformation and summation formulae for bilateral [formula] series. We begin with the following important result of Kadell and Kaneko [\cite=kaneko96a] [\cite=kad97a] [\cite=kaneko97b] which is equivalent to the [formula] summation theorem given above

Given a partition λ∈P let

[formula]

where Δq(x) is the Macdonald weight function given in ([\ref=dedo]) and a, b are arbitrary complex numbers. Then

[formula]

The connection with the [formula] formula is as follows: suppose

[formula]

It follows from the orthogonality of Macdonald polynomials that [formula] with Aλ(a,b) given as in Theorem [\ref=ct]. Now, the transformation xi  →  q- u / xi certainly doesn't affect the constant term of the expression appearing in Theorem [\ref=ct]. Thus

[formula]

As above, it follows that if

[formula]

then [formula]. Define

[formula]

It follows from ([\ref=zapato.1]) and ([\ref=zapato.2]) that

[formula]

We now note there are a couple of values of u for which we can derive an alternative expression for I(a,b,a',b';u). The case u = a - 1 In this case, note that (xi)a(qaxi)b'  =  (xi)a + b'. Using the q-binomial theorem to expand [formula] and inserting in ([\ref=idef]) we have

[formula]

where we have used ([\ref=llave]) with u =  - 1. Comparing ([\ref=hijastra]) with the u = a - 1 case of ([\ref=manzana]) gives (upon setting α1  =  q- b, α2  =  q- b', α3  =  q1 + a and α4  =  q1 + a') the transformation formula

[formula]

Note that when α3  =  qα1, the [formula] appearing in the above equation can be summed by Gauss's formula ([\ref=gauss.n]) yielding the summation formula

[formula]

The case u =  - 1 Note from the definition ([\ref=idef]) that

[formula]

Taking for example, the first of these relations, and using the equivalent expressions given by ([\ref=manzana]) gives the following transformation formula

[formula]

The q  →  1 limit

One of the curious features of the bilateral basic series [formula] is that there appears to be no analogue of Gauss's summation for the [formula] series, whereas in the q = 1 case, the bilateral [formula] series with unit argument can indeed be summed [\cite=doug07]. Let us now show that this behaviour carries over in the multivariable case. We begin by defining the q  →  1 limit of the bilateral series [formula], namely

[formula]

Here Pλ(x;k) is the Jack polynomial (normalized so that the coefficient of the monomial symmetric function mλ(x) is unity), the generalized Pochhammer symbols are defined by [formula] with [formula] being the usual Pochhammer symbol, and [formula] which is the q  →  1 limit of h'λ defined in ([\ref=libro]).

It follows from ([\ref=manzana]) that

[formula]

where [formula] is the appropriate limit of the corresponding Macdonald quantity, given in ([\ref=ground]). The crucial point now is that in the q = 1 case, we can combine the quantities a and b' (respectively a' and b) in the definition of I(a,b,a',b';u) in ([\ref=idef]), so that

[formula]

From these two equations, we have the summation formula

[formula]

which certainly reduces to Dougall's result [\cite=doug07] when n = 1.

Bailey's [formula] transformations

In this final section, we shall derive multivariable analogues of Bailey's general transformations for [formula] series [\cite=bail50a]. First, given a general partition λ∈P, define [formula]. It follows from ([\ref=sombrero]) (which can easily be seen to hold for all partitions σ∈P) and ([\ref=shift]) that

[formula]

It also follows from the definitions that

[formula]

The proof follows [\cite=bail50a]: from the [formula] summation formula ([\ref=raman]) it follows that

[formula]

We now need to compare the constant terms on each sides. Certainly, the product Pλ(z)  Pμ(z) only has a constant term if μ =  - λR and that constant term is [formula]. If we now use this fact to write down the constant terms in each side of ([\ref=nectarine]), using the simplifications ([\ref=jb]) and changing parameters, we end up with the transformation

[formula]

Following [\cite=bail50a], we can rewrite this using the identity

[formula]

which follows from making the substitution λ  →    -  λR in the definition of the [formula] series and simplifying using ([\ref=jb]). The final result is thus

[formula]

We remark here that the transformations appearing in previous section ([\ref=beetroot]), ([\ref=corn]) are special cases of the transformation ([\ref=bt]).
