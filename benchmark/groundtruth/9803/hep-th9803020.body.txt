On Anyonic Propagators

There are various actions in the literature[\cite=R1] for particles with fractional spins, called anyons[\cite=R2], that can be present in nature and explain phenomena such as the fractional quantum Hall effect and high temperature superconductivity[\cite=R3]. Such models have been constructed in at least two ways: one is coupling to some matter field a statistical field of the Chern-Simons type that changes the statistics; and the other is the group-theoretical method that implies a classical mechanical model with a Poincaré invariant Lagrangian which is quantized[\cite=R4] [\cite=R5]. In this Letter, we consider a simple action obtained by the latter approach with minimal extension of the phase space that preserves all canonical structure of the space-time and spin algebra. We propose a path integral representation for the propagator in a convenient gauge. In[\cite=R4], the following continuous family of Lagrangians for free anyons was obtained

[formula]

where m and α are respectively the mass and the helicity of the anyon, and s is an arbitrary constant deduced from the Casimir of the spin algebra, S2 =  - s2. The functions fμ satisfy the non-linear differential equation

[formula]

and we obtain the relations

[formula]

with [formula]. On the other hand, we have that [formula], so we get, [formula],   Sμ  fμ = 0,   [formula],   [formula]. The equation [formula] is equivalent to Eq. (2) and we have also

[formula]

and fμ = aμq2 + bμq + cμ, with aμ = (1,0, - 1),  bμ = ( - 1,1,1),[formula]. In this way, we extract for q not constant the condition [formula]. The Lagrangian is subject to the constraint, [formula], and with [formula], we obtain [formula] which satisfies and gives us that [formula]. Then, [formula] and π  (f  .  p) =  - α  m, that is, Sμ  pμ  +  αm = 0 and [formula], and in the gauge [formula], we have [formula], so σ = e  m and p2 - m2 = 0.

Now, we consider the path integral representation for the anyonic propagator with the action, [formula]. In that gauge, we verify that the continuous family of Lagrangians appears as

[formula]

In this way, we propose the path integral representation for the free fractional spin particle as

[formula]

[formula]

where M2 = m2 - 2m2α and the delta functional takes into account the gauge, [formula]. We define the measure

[formula]

such that, making the sustitution

[formula]

we obtain the new boundary conditions x(0) = 0 = x(1). So, in Eq. (5), we have the factor:

[formula]

[formula]

Given that

[formula]

we arrive at the path integral representation for the propagator

[formula]

and s2 > 0 for the causal propagator. This expression was obtained along the same lines as those used elsewhere for the scalar particle[\cite=R6]. On the other hand, in momentum space, the anyonic propagator has the form[\cite=R7]

[formula]

Now, we consider the light-like case, for the anyon in a constant electromagnetic field [formula]. Following[\cite=R8], we perform the calculation in the representation over velocities, which is characterized by the absence of derivatives in time after integration over bosonic variables and arbitrary boundary conditions. The propagator, in a first step, can be written as

[formula]

[formula]

where the new measure Dv has the form

[formula]

For the particle in a constant electromagnetic field we can obtain for the propagator

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

where

[formula]

[formula]

Thus we have, finally, the expression for the propagator as

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

If the electromagnetic field is turned off we obtain again the result Eq. (8) with s = 0 and, for α = 0, we obtain the path integral representation for the spinless particle propagator in (2 + 1)-dimensions.

In summary, we have obtained a path integral representation for the propagator of a free anyon Eq. (8) and its representation in momentum space Eq. (9) taking into account a continuous family of Lagrangians Eq. (4). These ones were obtained by a group-theoretical approach with minimal extension that preserves all canonical structure of the space-time and spin algebra. We also consider an anyon in a constant electromagnetic field. To obtain the propagator, a convenient gauge    [formula],[formula] was considered.
