Abstract

The remarkable absence of various radiative corrections in supersymmetric theories was first shown using supergraph techniques.1 Later Seiberg introduced a simple and powerful new approach to this problem,2 and used it to prove non-renormalization theorems in various special cases. This paper will use a generalized version of the Seiberg approach to give a proof of the perturbative non-renormalization theorems, that applies not only to the usual renormalizable theories but also to general non-renormalizable theories. These have a much richer set of couplings, involving terms of arbitrary order in the gauge superfield, that are shown to be unrenormalized.

This is of some importance in model building. As Witten3 pointed out long ago, it is the perturbative non-renormalization theorems that, by limiting the radiative corrections responsible for supersymmetry breaking to exponentially small non-perturbative terms, offer a hope that supersymmetry might solve the hierarchy problem. But the theory with which we have deal below the Planck or grand-unification scales is surely an effective quantum field theory, which contains non-renormalizable as well as renormalizable terms. Thus, in relying on supersymmetry to solve the hierarchy problem, we had better make sure that the non-renormalization theorems apply to non-renormalizable as well as to renormalizable theories.

We consider a general supersymmetric theory involving left-chiral superfields Φn, their right-chiral adjoints Φ*n, the matrix gauge superfield V, and their derivatives. The general supersymmetric action has a Lagrangian density of the form

[formula]

where G and F are general gauge-invariant functions of the arguments shown; '[formula]' denotes a dependence of G on superderivatives (or spacetime derivatives) of the other arguments; Wα is the usual gauge-covariant matrix left-chiral gauge superfield formed from V; α and β are two-component spinor indices with εαβ antisymmetric; and τ is the usual complex gauge coupling parameter

[formula]

The function [formula] must be holomorphic in the left-chiral superfields Φn and W, and may not depend on their superderivatives or spacetime derivatives because, as well known, any term in [formula] that did depend on these derivatives could be replaced with a gauge-invariant contribution to G. The terms [formula] and (τ / 8πi)Tr  (WTεW) in Eq. (1) could have been included in G and F, respectively; they are displayed here to identify the zeroth-order kinematic terms that serve as a starting point for perturbation theory.

The first perturbative non-renormalization theorem to be proved here states that the 'Wilsonian' effective Lagrangian density Lλ (which, with an ultraviolet cut-off λ, yields the same results as the original Lagrangian density (1)) takes the form

[formula]

where Gλ is some new function of the displayed variables, and τλ is a one-loop renormalized coupling parameter. For instance, for a simple gauge group we have

[formula]

Here Λ is an integration constant, and C1 and C2 are the Casimir constants of the gauge and left-chiral superfields, defined by

[formula]

where CABC are the structure constants, and tA are the matrices representing the gauge algebra on the left-chiral superfields. Not only is the the superpotential F(Φ,0) not renormalized -- the whole W-dependent integrand of the [formula] integral is not renormalized, except for a one-loop renormalization of the gauge coupling constant.

Here is the proof. Assuming that the cut-off respects supersymmetry and gauge invariance,4 these symmetries require the Wilsonian effective Lagrangian to take the same general form as Eq. (1):

[formula]

where Gλ and Fλ are again general gauge-invariant functions of the arguments shown, with Gλ Hermitian. (Since the functions Fλ and Gλ are not yet otherwise restricted, there is no loss of generality in extracting the terms shown explicitly in Eq. (6) from them.) Following Seiberg,2 we regard τ and the coefficients fr of the various terms in F(Φ,W) as independent external left-chiral superfields that happen to have constant scalar components and no spinor or auxiliary components, and that should also appear among the arguments of Fλ and (along with their adjoints) in Gλ.

To deal with the non-renormalizable part of the [formula] integral, we now also regard the coefficients of the various terms in the real function [formula] as real external superfields, which also have only constant scalar components. It is tempting to say that because these real superfields are non-chiral, they cannot appear in the integrand of the [formula] integral in Lλ, so that Fλ may be analyzed as if G were not present. This would be too hasty, because any real superfield P with a positive scalar component may be expressed in terms of a left-chiral superfield Z, as

[formula]

where VP has the form of a U(1) gauge superfield in any fixed gauge. (Note that ln P  →   ln P -  ln Z -  ln Z* is a generalized gauge transformation.) Eq. (7) is invariant under a phase transformation Z  →  Zeiα, which if unbroken would prevent the left-chiral superfield Z from appearing in Fλ. This symmetry is actually violated by non-perturbative effects. For instance, if we modify the usual renormalizable kinematic term for a multiplet of left-chiral superfields to read [formula], then since this depends only on ZΦ, the transformation Z  →  Zeiα, Φ  →  Φ has the same anomaly as the transformation Φ  →  Φeiα, Z  →  Z. This anomaly leads to a breakdown of this symmetry, which allows Z to appear in non-perturbative corrections to the superpotential. Indeed, if it were not for this breakdown of the symmetry under Z  →  Zeiα, there could be no non-perturbative corrections to the superpotential, because the kinematic term is invariant under a non-anomalous transformation Z  →  Zeiβ, Φ  →  Φe- iβ, which would prevent the generation of a non-perturbative term in the superpotential that depends on Φ but not Z. Here we are considering only perturbation theory, so Z cannot appear in Fλ, and by the same reasoning neither can any of the real superfields that appear as coefficients of the terms in G. Thus G can have no effect on Fλ.

With G ignored, the perturbation theory based on the Lagrangian density (1) has two symmetries that restrict the dependence of Fλ on τ and on the parameters fr in F(Φ,W). The first symmetry is conservation of an R quantum number: θL and θR have R =  + 1 and R =  - 1; τ and the Φm and V have R = 0; and the coefficients fr of all terms in F(Φ,W) with r factors of Wα have R = 2 - r. (Since Wα involves two superderivatives of V with respect to θR and one with respect to θL, it has R =  + 1. Also, in accordance with the usual rules for integration over Grassman parameters, integration of a function over θL lowers its R value by two units.) This symmetry requires the function Fλ(Φ,W,f,τ) to have R = 2, like F(Φ,W). The other symmetry is invariance under translation of τ by an arbitrary real number ξ:

[formula]

which leaves the action invariant because [formula] is a spacetime derivative. This tells us that Fλ is independent of τ, except for a possible term proportional to the WW term in F:

[formula]

with cλ a real function of λ.

To use this information, let us consider how many powers of τ are contributed to Fλ by each graph. Suppose a graph has EV external left-handed gaugino lines and any number of external Φ-lines; IV internal V-lines and any number of internal Φ-lines; Am pure gauge vertices with m  ≥  3 V-lines, arising from the WW term in Eq. (1); Bmr vertices with m  ≥  r V-lines and any number of Φ-lines, arising from the terms in F(Φ,W) with r factors of W; and Cm vertices with two Φ-lines and m  ≥  1 V-lines, arising from the [formula] term in Eq. (1). (By 'Φ-lines' and 'V-lines' are meant lines of the component fields of left-chiral or gauge superfields, respectively; these are ordinary Feynman graphs, not supergraphs.) These numbers are related by

[formula]

Also, since we have specified that all external V lines are for gauginos, this graph can only contribute to a term in Lλ with EV factors of W, so it must be proportional to a product of fr factors with total R-value 2 - EV, and so

[formula]

Using this to eliminate EV in Eq. (10), the number of factors of τ contributed by such a graph is then

[formula]

Each of the As, Bs, and Cs in the square brackets in Eq. (12) has a positive-definite coefficient, so there is a limit to the number of vertices of each type that can contribute to the τ-independent function Hλ. To have Nτ = 0, we can have A3 = 2 and all other As, Bs, and Cs zero, or A4 = 1 and all other As, Bs, and Cs zero, which give the one-gauge-loop contributions proportional to C1 in Eq. (4); or Bmr = 1 for some r and m = r, and all other As, Bs, and Cs zero, which add up to the one-vertex tree contribution F(Φ,W) to the function Hλ(Φ,W) in Eq. (9); or C1 = 2 and all other As, Bs, and Cs zero, or C2 = 2 and all other As, Bs, and Cs zero, which give the one-Φ-loop contributions proportional to C2 in Eq. (4). (Graphs with A3  =  C1 = 1 and all other As, Bs, and Cs zero are one-particle-reducible, and therefore do not contribute to Lλ.) Finally, Eq. (12) shows that there are no graphs at all with Nτ = 1, so the constant cλ in Eq. (9) vanishes, completing the proof of the non-renormalization theorem (3).

In theories where the gauge group has a U(1) factor, there is also one term in Gλ which is subject to a non-renormalization theorem. As pointed out by Fayet and Iliopoulos,5 although a U(1) gauge superfield V1 is not gauge invariant, [formula] is gauge invariant as well as supersymmetric, so we can include a term ξV1 in G. By detailed calculation, Fischler et al.6 showed that the constant ξ receives corrections for renormalizable theories only from one-loop diagrams, and that these corrections vanish if the sum of the U(1) charges of the left-chiral superfields vanish. Using the Seiberg trick of regarding coupling parameters as the scalar components of external superfields, it is easy to give a very simple proof7 of this result, which applies also in non-renormalizable theories, and even non-perturbatively. The point is, that a term [formula] in Gλ is not gauge-invariant if S depends in a non-trivial way on any superfields, including the external superfields τ or fr or those appearing as coefficients of the non-renormalizable terms in G. There is just one graph that can make a correction to ξ that is independent of all coupling constants: it is the one-loop tadpole graph, in which an external V1 line interacts with left-chiral superfields through the term [formula] in Eq. (1). This graph vanishes if the sum of the U(1) charges of the left-chiral superfields vanish. This condition is necessary (unless the U(1) gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken) to avoid gravitational anomalies8 that would violate the conservation of the U(1) current.

What good are the non-renormalization theorems, when so little is known about the structure of the function [formula]? Fortunately, in the absence of Fayet-Iliopoulos terms, it turns out that only the bare superpotential matters in deciding if supersymmetry is spontaneously broken: if the superpotential F(Φ,0) allows solutions of the equations ∂F(Φ,0) / ∂Φn = 0 then supersymmetry is not broken in any finite order of perturbation theory.

To test this, we must examine Lorentz-invariant field configurations, in which the Φn have only constant scalar components φn and constant auxiliary auxiliary components Fn, while (in Wess-Zumino gauge) the coefficients VA of the gauge generators tA in the matrix gauge superfield V have only auxiliary components DA. Supersymmetry is unbroken if there are values of φn for which Lλ has no terms of first order in Fn or DA, in which case there is sure to be an equilibrium solution with Fn = DA = 0. In the absence of Fayet-Iliopoulos terms, this requires that for all A

[formula]

and for all n

[formula]

where the effective Kahler potential Kλ(φ,φ*) is

[formula]

with [formula] obtained from Gλ by setting the gauge superfield and all superderivatives equal to zero. (With superderivatives required to vanish by Lorentz invariance, the only dependence of Gλ on V is a factor exp ( - V) following every factor [formula].) If there is any solution φ(0) of Eq. (14), then the gauge symmetry tells us that there is a continuum of such solutions, with φn replaced with

[formula]

where (since F depends only on φ, not φ*), the ξA are an arbitrary set of complex parameters. If Kλ(φ,φ*) has a stationary point anywhere on the surface φ  =  φ(ξ), then at that point

[formula]

Since this must be satisfied for all infinitesimal complex δξA, the coefficients of both δξA and δξ*A must both vanish, and therefore Eq. (13) as well as Eq. (14) is satisfied at this point. Thus the existence of a stationary point of Kλ(φ,φ*) on the surface φ  =  φ(ξ) would imply that supersymmetry is unbroken to all orders of perturbation theory. The zeroth-order Kahler potential [formula] is bounded below and goes to infinity as φ  →    ∞  , so it certainly has a minimum on the surface φ  =  φ(ξ), where of course it is stationary. At this minimum there are flat directions: ordinary global gauge transformations [formula] with ξA real. But these are also flat directions for the perturbation Gλ(φ,φ*,0,0). Thus there is still a local minimum of Kλ on the surface φ  =  φ(ξ) for any perturbation Gλ(φ,φ*,0,0) in at least a finite range, and thus to all orders in whatever couplings appear in Gλ(φ,φ*,0,0). We see that in such a theory supersymmetry can only be broken by non-perturbative effects, which can naturally lead to a solution of the hierarchy problem.
