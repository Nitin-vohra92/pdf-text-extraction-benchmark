Abstract

Following a previous study of the one-loop factorization of the nonsinglet g2 structure function of the nucleon, we present in this paper the next-to-leading order coefficient functions in the singlet sector. To obtain the result, the partonic processes of virtual Compton scattering off two and three "on-shell" gluons are calculated. A key step in achieving the correct factorization is to separate the correct twist-two contribution. The Burkardt-Cottingham sum rule is nominally satisfied at this order.

In lepton-nucleon deep-inelastic scattering with the electromagnetic current, two spin-dependent structure functions of the nucleon can be studied: g1,2(xB,Q2). g1(xB,Q2) is closely related to the spin structure of the nucleon and has been investigated extensively in the last decade. g2(xB,Q2) is present in processes involving transversely polarized nucleons and is a three-twist structure function in the sense that it contributes to physical observables at order 1 / Q [\cite=hey]. The experimental measurements of the g2 structure function have been done by several collaborations [\cite=exp]. There is a long history in debating the physics involved in g2(xB,Q2). As more results from quantum chromodynamics (QCD) are obtained and understood, it is generally accepted that g2(xB,Q2) probes quark and gluon correlations in the nucleon which cannot be accessed through Feynman-type incoherent parton scattering.

At leading-order, g2(xB,Q2) can be expressed in terms of a simple parton distribution ΔqT(x),

[formula]

where

[formula]

This result has lead to many incorrect interpretations of the g2 physics. When the leading-logarithmic corrections are studied, it is found that ΔqT(x,Q2) mixes with other more complicated distributions under scale evolution [\cite=Shur]. In fact, ΔqT(x,Q2) is a special moment of a general class of parton distributions involving two light-cone variables [\cite=bkl] [\cite=Rat]. When the scale changes, only those general distributions evolve autonomously.

Thus a general factorization formula for g2 is much more involved than the leading-order result shows. It should contain the generalized two-variable distributions, Ki(x,y). Indeed, we shall write in general

[formula]

where Ci are the coefficient functions. In a previous paper [\cite=lastpap], we studied the factorization of the nonsinglet part at the one-loop order where there were two distributions, K1a,2a, associated with each nonsinglet component a, and their one-loop coefficient functions were obtained for the first time.

In this paper, we study the one-loop factorization of the singlet part of gT(xB,Q2). The subject has previously been considered in Ref. [\cite=Bel], a comparison of the results will be made in the end of the paper. Contrary to the previous conclusion, the result of this paper represents a local operator product expansion. Throughout, we use the kinematics defined in [\cite=lastpap]. We first define the singlet quark distributions,

[formula]

where the sum is over all quark flavors. Their one-loop coefficient functions are

[formula]

where [formula] is the mean square quark charge and Nf is the number of active quark flavors. Using the relation

[formula]

it is easy to see that the result is consistent with Eq. (1).

The general strategy of higher-twist factorization beyond the leading orders has been presented in [\cite=lastpap] and will not be repeated here. For the singlet factorization, we need to consider four classes of parton intermediate states: two quarks, two quarks-one gluon, two gluons, and three gluons. In the cases of two-quark and two-quark-one-gluon states, many of the relevant diagrams have been considered in [\cite=lastpap]; we will not repeat that analysis here. In addition we must take into account the explicit singlet diagrams shown in Fig. 1. A detailed calculation shows that their contributions cancel. Thus the one-loop coefficient functions of KiΣ(x,y) remain the same as those of the non-singlet sector. In what follows, we focus entirely on two- and three-gluon intermediate states.

The diagrams involving two-gluon intermediate states are shown in Fig. 2. To isolate the O(1 / Q) contribution, the incoming gluon is given a transverse momentum which is expanded to first order in the internal propagators. Our calculation shows that only the correlation function

[formula]

contributes, where α and μ take only transverse values.

The perturbative diagrams corresponding to three gluon intermediate states are shown in Fig. 3. The relevant correlation function is

[formula]

All fields and couplings in the above expressions are bare. Gauge invariance demands that the final result depends on the combination

[formula]

of distributions, where [formula]. In addition, gauge invariance demands that physical observables depend on moments of

[formula]

With appropriate insertions of light-cone gauge links, which can be generated by summing over states with additional longitudinally-polarized gluons, KgB is gauge invariant. Our goal is to calculate its one-loop coefficient function.

The Compton amplitude for virtual photon scattering on a transversely polarized nucleon can be written as (ε0123  =    +  1),

[formula]

In QCD, we can write the singlet part as

[formula]

where the M's are perturbation series in αs and have infrared poles. Once again, the tree and one-loop level expressions for MiΣ are the same as the nonsinglet case in Ref. [\cite=lastpap].

The amplitude Mg starts at the one-loop level. To simplify the expression, we assume |xB|  >  1 so that the amplitude is purely real.

Since all Feynman diagrams are computed in bare perturbation theory, the result depends on the bare coupling gB. We replace it with the renormalized coupling in the [formula] scheme; the difference appears only at higher orders in αs(μ2). A straightforward calculation yields

[formula]

where ε  =  4 - d, μ̄2  =  4πe-  γEμ2, and γE is the Euler constant. We have also introduced the generator normalization TF  =  1 / 2.

Now we want to show that SΣT(xB,Q2) is factorizable at the one-loop level, i.e., the infrared poles 1 / ε in Mg match the ultraviolet poles in KgB. To this end, we use the infrared poles in Mg to generate a scale evolution equation for the renormalized parton distributions,

[formula]

where the ellipses denote the homogeneous part of the evolution. This contribution is given explicitly in Ref. [\cite=lastpap]. In order to compare this result to the known twist-three evolution [\cite=bkl], we must first remove the twist-two contribution. Consider the twist-two operator

[formula]

whose indices have been symmetrized and whose traces have been removed. Its matrix elements in the nucleon state are given by

[formula]

It is the [formula] component of θ that appears in this transverse process :

[formula]

Here, latin indices are understood to take values in the transverse dimensions. Expanding Eq. ([\ref=evolve]) in the large xB limit, one arrives at evolution equations for the moments of the parton distributions. Removing the twist-two part of these equations via Eq. ([\ref=tw2]), one can obtain the evolution of the twist-three operators. A detailed check shows that our result is identical to that found in Ref. [\cite=bkl] obtained by studying the ultraviolet divergences present in the twist-three operators. We note here that this separation provides a new homogeneous term in the evolution of the singlet twist-three quark operators. In the absence of this term, the diagonal evolution of these operators would be identical to that in the nonsinglet sector since the contributions displayed in Fig. 1 vanish.

The final step of the calculation is to take the imaginary part of the factorized SΣT(xB,Q2) to get a factorized expression for the structure function gΣT(xB,Q2) in the physical region xB < 1. We find the coefficient function

[formula]

where θ(x) is the step-function, which appears in Eq. [\ref=resuts] along with a factor of 1 / (y - x).

To check the Burkhardt-Cottingham sum rule [\cite=bc], we integrate gΣT(xB,Q2) over xB. Assuming the integration over x and y can be interchanged with that of xB, one obtains

[formula]

where γ5 has been defined in the 't Hooft-Veltman scheme. The coefficient 7 / 2 reduces to 3 / 2 if we define γ5 so that the nonsinglet axial current is conserved. Compared with the factorization formula for g1(xB,Q2) [\cite=kodaira], we have the Burkhardt-Cottingham sum rule at one loop;

[formula]

If the order of integration cannot be interchanged because of the singular behavior of the parton distributions at small x and y, the above sum rule may be violated. Indeed, some small xB studies indicate such singular behavior [\cite=smallx].

Finally, we consider the next-to-leading order correction to the singlet part of the x2 moment of gT(xB,Q2). In the leading order, it is well known:

[formula]

where a2 is the second moment of the g1(x,Q2) structure function and d2 is a twist-three matrix element [\cite=jj]. Using the coefficient functions found above, we have

[formula]

Using the next-to-leading result for g1Σ(x,Q2) [\cite=kodaira], we find

[formula]

Notice that the combination of gT and g1 relevant to d2Σ receives no radiative correction, as in the nonsinglet sector. A detailed calculation shows that analogous results are valid for all higher moments as well [\cite=newpap]. This implies that the tree relation between g1(x,Q2) and the twist-2 part of g2(x,Q2) is respected at one-loop order. These results and their implications will be presented in a future communication [\cite=newpap].

The significance of the present result is as follows. In the leading order analysis of g2, one just needs the leading-logarithmic evolution of Ki(x,y) which is now well known [\cite=bkl] [\cite=Rat] [\cite=evolve1], including its large Nc behavior [\cite=largenc]. In the next-to-leading order, one needs to know the coefficient functions and the two-loop evolution of Ki(x,y). The former is now complete with Ref. [\cite=lastpap] and the present paper. The latter has not yet been calculated, but in generally its effort is not as important as the coefficient function we calculate here.

Finally, let us add a few remarks on the comparison of our findings with a previous calculation of Ref. [\cite=Bel]. As has been noted earlier [\cite=Bel00] the result of that paper is not complete since the contributions of twist-three two-gluon operators, i.e. the diagrams on Fig. [\ref=fig2], were not accounted for. Since the effect of two-gluon graphs on the final answer is reduced to a redefinition of the correlation function (schematically) from [formula] to [formula] without affecting the three-gluon coefficient function, we can directly compare both results. Before we do it, we observe that the basis of three-gluon functions used in [\cite=jiold] [\cite=Bel] is redundant, namely, in the decomposition

[formula]

obviously, the Lorentz structure in front of [formula] can be expressed in terms of the first line using an identity

[formula]

Therefore, in final equations of [\cite=Bel] we have to put [formula] to be consistent with the present analysis. Moreover, the result in Ref. [\cite=jiold] must be also modified correspondingly.

Next, to have a correspondence with the correlation functions used here and in Ref. [\cite=Bel], we have identify the momentum fractions of the gluon lines as follows: x  =  x1 and y  =  x1  -  x2. For the latter convenience we introduce as well a new coefficient function

[formula]

Since the function N(x1,x2) is symmetric w.r.t. interchange of its arguments only symmetric part of E(1)g(x1,x1  -  x2;xB) will survive. Thus, a symmetrization leads to the equation

[formula]

where E2 is the coefficient function from Ref. [\cite=Bel].
