Microscopic substructure effects in potential-model descriptions of the 7Be(p,γ)8B reaction

The 7Be(p,γ)8B reaction at solar energies (Ecm ≤   20 keV) plays an important role in the 'solar neutrino puzzle' since the neutrino event rate in the existing chlorine and water Cerenkov detectors is either dominated by or almost entirely due to the high-energy neutrinos produced in the subsequent β decay of 8B. Direct measurements of the 7Be(p,γ)8B rate, however, are extremely difficult, since the absolute cross sections diminish exponentially at low energies. Thus, theoretical studies of this process become very valuable. In addition to microscopic theories, such as the nuclear shell model or cluster models, potential models provide a popular framework for such investigations. In the latter approach, an average potential is used to generate single-particle wave functions and to calculate various observables; microscopic substructure effects are (partly) accounted for through the use of spectroscopic factors. This strategy, however, has recently been called into question by Csótó [\cite=Csoto00], who argued that spectroscopic factors should not be included in potential-model calculations of the 7Be(p,γ)8B cross section.

Csótó's argument is based on the observation that the 7Be(p,γ)8B reaction at low energies depends only on the asymptotic normalization of the 8B bound-state wave function [\cite=Muk99], whereas the spectroscopic factor arises from the short-ranged properties of the wave function. However, the unstated assumption underlying this line of reasoning, namely that the short-range and long-range parts of the wave function are independent, is incorrect. For example, the bound state is normalized by [formula], a global condition which illustrates that a change in the wave function at any radius affects the normalization integral and thus the value of the wave function everywhere, including in the tail region. Moreover, there exists a more subtle connection between the asymptotic normalization and the short-range behavior of the wave function based on the bound-state Lippmann-Schwinger equation [\cite=Jennings00]. In fact, the asymptotic normalization can be given in terms of an integral over the interior of the nucleus [\cite=Jennings00].

The arguments presented in ref. [\cite=Csoto00], as well as the connection between short-range and long-range parts of the wave function that was outlined in ref. [\cite=Jennings00], have motivated us to reconsider the proper treatment of microscopic nuclear structure effects in potential-model descriptions of external capture reactions. In this paper we study how potential models are related to the full nuclear many-body problem. We set up a perturbative scheme for the many-body system which, in the lowest-order approximation, gives the potential model and discuss higher-order corrections coming from the microscopic nuclear structure. The spectroscopic factor will be shown to arise naturally in this framework.

The eight-body wave functions for the 8B ground state and the proton-7Be scattering state are written as [formula] and [formula], respectively. Here k is the asymptotic value of the momentum of the scattering particle relative to the 7Be system, and we have introduced the Jacobi coordinates

[formula]

with [formula]. The dependence of the wave functions on the center-of-mass coordinate, [formula], can be factored out in the form of a plane wave and will be suppressed throughout this paper.

The eigenstates of the seven-body 7Be Hamiltonian, [formula], form a complete set of wave functions when both bound and scattering states are included. Using this complete set, the eight-body bound-state wave function for 8B can be written as

[formula]

where the summation symbol indicates a sum over the bound states and an integral over the continuum states. The expansion coefficients,

[formula]

are obtained by inverting eq. ([\ref=eq_expn]). Note that [formula] is the spectroscopic amplitude as defined in ref. [\cite=Csoto00]. Its norm is simply the spectroscopic factor, [formula] and we will show below that [formula] can be identified as a one-body wave function.

The 8B Hamiltonian, H8, can be written as [formula], where H7 is the Hamiltonian for the 7Be nucleus and [formula] denotes the reduced mass of the eight-body system. Since |ψn7〉 and |ψB8〉 are eigenstates of H7 and H8, respectively, we have:

[formula]

Inserting the expansion given in eq. ([\ref=eq_expn]) for |ψB8〉, we obtain a set of exact, Schrödinger-like, coupled equations for the coefficients:

[formula]

The normalization condition for the [formula] follows from eq. ([\ref=eq_expn]):

[formula]

The spectroscopic factor is thus [formula] and differs from one because of the [formula] terms in the sum.

From eq. ([\ref=eq_schro]) we can extract information on the long-range behavior of the 8B ground state wave function. The matrix element [formula], for n or m corresponding to a 7Be bound state, has a range on the order of the potential convoluted with the bound-state wave function. Thus it falls off rapidly with increasing [formula]. When both ψn7 and ψm7 describe continuum states, the matrix element has a long-ranged, but infinitesimal, tail. Solving eq. ([\ref=eq_schro]) outside the range of the potential, we find that the [formula] decouple and fall off exponentially, [formula], where [formula]. Since (En7 - EB8) is smallest for n = 1, the long-range behavior of the 8B wave function is dominated by [formula] and the associated asymptotic normalization is given by [formula]. Coulomb effects have been ignored in these considerations.

In order to study the relationship between potential models and the full many-body problem, we consider the above set of coupled differential equations for arbitrary distances. However, we introduce a well-defined approximation scheme. The off-diagonal matrix elements [formula], n  ≠  m, will be treated as a perturbation. In zeroth order we take Vnm  =  0 for n  ≠  m, that is, only the diagonal terms survive in eq. ([\ref=eq_schro]). The equations for the coefficients [formula] decouple and take the form of Hartree equations for the eighth particle moving in the mean field of the other nucleons. The Hartree potential, Vnm, is different for each [formula] since the two-body potential is convoluted over different seven-body configurations. Assuming that the ground state of 8B is built on the ground state of 7Be, only [formula] can occur in the zeroth-order expansion of |ψB8〉, that is, [formula]. Coefficients [formula], with n > 1, are associated with excited states of the 7Be system and therefore contribute (to lowest order) only to higher-energy states of 8B. Since the 8B states are orthonormal, it follows directly that the [formula] which correspond to bound states are normalized to one and those associated with continuum states are normalized to a delta function.

From the considerations above, it becomes apparent that each [formula] is normalized and satisfies a single-particle, Schrödinger-like, wave equation with a mean field of the Hartree type. Therefore, the [formula] can be identified with potential-model wave functions. We recall that [formula] is, by definition, the spectroscopic amplitude, and thus find that the potential-model wave function associated with the ground state of 8B yields the lowest-order approximation to the spectroscopic amplitude.

Since, in lowest order, [formula] for n > 1, it follows from eq. ([\ref=eq_schro]) that there is no first-order correction to the coefficient [formula]; the next correction to [formula] is of second order in the off-diagonal coupling. Nevertheless, coefficients [formula] with n > 1 contribute to the 8B ground state in first order, thus the norm of [formula] changes from S = 1 to S < 1. The deviation of the spectroscopic factor from one is of second order in the off-diagonal matrix elements Vnm.

The 7Be-p scattering state |ψS8〉 can be expanded similarly to the 8B bound state:

[formula]

Proceeding as before, we obtain a set of coupled equations for the expansion coefficients [formula]:

[formula]

A perturbative treatment of the coupling matrix elements Vnm is possible here as well: In lowest order the equations decouple and only [formula] contributes to |ψS8〉. The [formula] with n > 1 contribute to the scattering state in first order and the next correction to [formula] is of second order in the Vnm. There is no spectroscopic factor associated with the scattering wave function, since |ψS8〉 is normalized by its value at asymptotically large distances, rather than by an integral.

Considering the long-range behavior of |ψS8〉, we infer the following from eq. ([\ref=eq_scatt]): If the incident proton has a kinetic energy less than that of the first excited 7Be state (E27=0.429 MeV [\cite=Tilley99]), [formula] becomes oscillatory for large [formula], while the [formula] with n > 1 are exponentially damped. Hence, for low reaction energies, the n = 1 term dominates the long-range behavior of the scattering wave function: [formula]. At higher energies, [formula] with n > 1 display oscillatory behavior and thus a coupled-channels approach to the problem may become necessary.

The dominant contribution to the direct capture process 7Be(p,γ)8B arises from an electric dipole transition between the 7Be-p scattering state and the 8B ground state [\cite=Kim87]. The relevant matrix element is given by:

[formula]

where the "Jacobi charges", εi ([formula]), are defined such that [formula] and ε8 equals Q, the total charge of the system. Since the final-state wave function, |ψB8〉, is anti-symmetric and the dipole operator, [formula], is symmetric, it is not necessary to anti-symmetrize the initial-state wave function, |ψS8〉. Without loss of generality, we can thus take the eighth nucleon to be the incident particle. Note also that the diagonal matrix elements in the last line, [formula], vanish since [formula] has odd parity and we can choose the 7Be wave functions, |ψn7〉, to be states of good parity.

To lowest order in the perturbative expansion for the wave functions only terms with n = m = 1 survive. Thus we obtain:

[formula]

where the Jacobi charge

[formula]

accounts for the fact that the photon couples to both the initial nucleus and to the incident proton [\cite=ChristyDuck61]. The lowest-order term of the perturbative expansion corresponds to the one-body approximation as given, for example, in ref. [\cite=ChristyDuck61].

The first-order corrections to the matrix element of the dipole operator originate entirely from the n = 1, [formula] and [formula], m = 1 terms in the second sum of eq. ([\ref=eq_matel]). Note that [formula], for m > 1, contains dipole excitations of the 7Be core, that is, the transition operator acts on the internal coordinates of the seven-body system. These first-order effects are short-ranged and will be suppressed at low energies, for which the reaction takes place predominately in the tail of wave function.

While there are no first-order corrections to the first sum in eq. ([\ref=eq_matel]), there are several second-order effects: First, there are [formula] contributions, which will be suppressed at low energies since [formula] and [formula] are exponentially damped for large [formula]. Second, there are corrections to both [formula] and [formula] which are due to the off-diagonal coupling. Since [formula] and [formula] depend on only one coordinate, these modifications can be accommodated by adjusting the one-body potential in a manner similar to the construction of an optical-model potential. Third, [formula] is no longer normalized to one but to the spectroscopic factor, as follows from eq. ([\ref=eq_norm]). In addition, there are second-order corrections to the second sum in eq. ([\ref=eq_matel]), such as [formula], [formula] contributions. These, again, correspond to dipole excitations of the 7Be core and are thus short-range effects, which are negligible at small energies.

From the above considerations it follows that the spectroscopic factor should be explicitly included in potential-model descriptions of external capture reactions. When the off-diagonal matrix elements Vnm are treated perturbatively, the spectroscopic factor arises naturally in the normalization of the bound-state wave function at second order and is present at all higher orders. For low-energy reactions first-order contributions and second-order effects not contained in the spectroscopic factor are either small or may be included by an appropriate modification of the one-body potential. At higher energies these first- and second-order corrections may become important and it will no longer be sufficient to accommodate many-body correlations through the use of spectroscopic factors alone.

The arguments for including the spectroscopic factor can be taken beyond perturbation theory. At low energies, eq. ([\ref=eq_pert]) will be valid more generally since the neglected terms are associated with short-range effects while the reaction occurs at large distances. Thus we have to evaluate an integral which contains two functions of one variable, a scattering wave function, [formula], and a bound-state wave function, [formula]. Formally, we can construct Schrödinger-like equations for these coefficients using Green functions. To illustrate this, we rewrite the coupled differential equations for the expansion coefficients [formula] (eqs. ([\ref=eq_schro]) and ([\ref=eq_scatt])) as follows:

[formula]

[formula]

Here α = B or S, for the bound and scattering states, respectively. The latter equation is valid for n > 1 and can be expressed as:

[formula]

where

[formula]

Let G be the Green function matrix which solves [formula] [formula]. It then follow that

[formula]

is a solution of eq. ([\ref=eq_matrix]). Inserting this result into the right-hand side of eq. ([\ref=eq_alpha1]) yields an exact one-body, Schrödinger-like, wave equation for [formula]. For the bound-state case, that is, for α = B, this wave function is normalized to the spectroscopic factor.

To summarize, we have studied the relationship between potential-model descriptions of the capture reaction 7Be(p,γ)8B and the full many-body problem. To this end, we set up a perturbative scheme for the many-body system and identified the potential-model wave function as the zeroth-order approximation to the spectroscopic amplitude. We showed that the lowest-order term in the perturbative expansion of the relevant transition matrix element corresponds to the standard one-body approximation; the spectroscopic factor was found to arise naturally in the normalization of the bound-state wave function at second order. At low energies, where first-order effects and additional second-order corrections are small, the spectroscopic factor allows one to incorporate the most important many-body correlations in potential-model descriptions of external capture reactions and should thus be included explicitly in the calculations. At higher energies, where contributions from the interior of the nucleus become important, additional microscopic nuclear structure effects arise and including the spectroscopic factor will no longer be sufficient.
