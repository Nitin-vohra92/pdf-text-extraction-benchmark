Introduction

It is now largely accepted that absorbed AGN play a significant (and perhaps major) role in the production of the Cosmic X-ray Background (CXB) above 2 keV (see Gilli et al., these proceedings) and should be the site where a large fraction of the energy density of the universe is generated (Fabian and Iwasawa, 1999). However, many important questions are still unsolved. For example, the relationship between narrow and broad line AGN in the optical regime and absorbed and unabsorbed AGN in the X-ray regime is still unclear, and doubts on the very existence of high luminosity Type 2 AGN are often cast (see e.g. Halpern, Turner and George, 1999; Akiyama et al., 2000; Salvati and Maiolino, 2000). We briefly address these points using the ASCA HSS sample (Della Ceca et al., 1999a and references therein) and its present AGN contents. Although this small sample of identified objects is probably not representative of the whole population, it allows us to glimps the bright (>  10- 13 erg cm- 2 s- 1,2 - 10 keV) population of hard X-ray sources expected to be present in Chandra and XMM-Newton fields.

The X-ray Spectral Properties of the ASCA HSS sample

To investigate the X-ray spectral properties of the sources, we defined the Hardness Ratios, [formula] and [formula], where S, H and M are the observed net counts in the 0.7-  2.0, 2.0-  4.0, and 4.0-  10.0 keV energy bands respectively.

In Figure 1 we report the position of the sources in the HR1-HR2 plane for identified Type 1 and Type 2 AGN and for the complete ASCA HSS sample, along with the loci expected from a single absorbed power-law model, with energy index and absorbing column density as indicated in the figures (see Della Ceca et al., 1999b for details).

It is worth noting the large spread in HR1 and HR2 displayed by the sources and the departure from the loci of absorbed, single power law spectra; this implies a more complex broad band (0.7 -   10 keV) source spectrum and confirms the results previously reported by Della Ceca et al., 1999b who used a pilot sample of 60 ASCA serendipitous sources. The new picture that is now emerging is that some of the optically classified Type 1 AGN seem to have a complex and very flat (αE  ≤  0.4) 2-10 keV spectrum, probably indicative of X-ray absorption. A similar result has been also obtained independently by the HELLAS team (Vignali et al., these proceedings), based on BeppoSAX data.

A Compton-Thick and a High Luminosity Type 2 AGN

In the "Type 2 AGN panel" of Figure 1 we have marked (n. 1 to 4) the Type 2 AGN for which we have enough counts for a more accurate X-ray spectroscopic analysis. The X-ray spectra of object #1 and object #2 are reported in figure 2. Object #1 is described by an absorbed power law model with photon index (Γ) equal to 1.73  ±  0.5 and absorbing column density (NH) =  5.9  ±  1.6  ×  1022 cm- 2 (1σ confidence errors). This object is spectroscopically identified with a narrow line AGN at z=0.398; at this redshift the intrinsic (i.e. unabsorbed) 2-  10 keV luminosity is ~  2  ×  1045 erg s- 1 (H0 = 50 km s- 1 Mpc- 1; q0  =  0.0), making this object one of the few high luminosity Type 2 AGN known to date. The X-ray spectrum of object #2 is described by the so called "leaky-absorber" continua with Γ  =  1.6  ±  0.2, NH  =  2.5+ 1.8- 1.1  ×  1024 cm- 2 and uncovered fraction of ~  0.8%. This object is spectroscopically identified with a nearby (z=0.046) Seyfert 2 galaxy. Because of its high absorbing column density this object is probably a Compton thick system with an intrinsic luminosity of ~  3  ×  1044 erg s- 1. Full details on these two objects (e.g. radio, optical and X-ray properties) will be reported in a forthcoming paper. Objects #3 and #4 are described by the "leaky-absorber" continua plus a narrow line(s). Object #3 is the well known Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 6552 at z=0.026. Its spectrum requires Γ  ~  1.4, NH  ~  6  ×  1023 cm- 2, an uncovered fraction of ~  2% and a narrow Gaussian line at ~  6.4 keV with an equivalent width of 0.9 keV; its intrinsic luminosity is ~  6  ×  1042 erg s- 1 (Fukazawa et al., 1994). Finally, object #4 was originally classified as a Type 2 AGN directly from X-ray data and it was subsequently confirmed as such by optical spectroscopy (Della Ceca et al., 2000). Its X-ray spectrum requires Γ  =  2.5  ±  0.3, NH  =  1.8  ±  0.4  ×  1023 cm- 2, an unresolved Gaussian line at ~  6.4 keV with equivalent width of ~  0.6 keV and uncovered fraction of ~  0.7%; at the redshift of the object (z=0.029) its intrinsic luminosity is ~  1.3  ×  1043 erg s- 1. These four examples, along with the possible existence of absorbed Type 1 AGN, show the large diversity of the sources expected to be found in the Chandra and XMM-Newton fields.
