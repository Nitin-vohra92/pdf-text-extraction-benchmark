In a recent paper, Castro, Granik and El Naschie have given a rationale for the three dimensionality of our physical space within the framework of a Cantorian fractal space time and El Naschie's earlier work thereon[\cite=r1] [\cite=r2]. An ensemble is used and the value for the average dimension involving the golden mean is deduced close to the value of our 3  +  1 dimensions. We now make a few remarks based on an approach which is in the spirit of the above considerations. Our starting point is the fact that the fractal dimension of a quantum path is two, which, it has been argued is described by the coordinates (x,ict)[\cite=r3]. Infact this leads to discretized space time, and a non commutative geometry as in the approach of El Naschie, Castro and Granik, and further the Dirac equation of the spin half electron is seen to emerge from these considerations[\cite=r4]. Given the spin half, it is then possible to deduce the dimensionality of an ensemble of such particles, which turns out to be three[\cite=r5] [\cite=r6]. There is another way of looking at this. If we generalise from the one space dimensional case and the complex (x,t) plane to three dimensions, we infact obtain the four dimensional case and the Theory of Quarternions, which are based on the Pauli Spin Matrices[\cite=r7]. As has been noted by Sachs, had Hamilton identified the fourth coordinate in the above generalisation with time, then he would have anticipated Special Relativity itself. It must be observed that the Pauli Spin Matrices which denote the Quantum Mechanical spin half form, again, a non commutative structure. Curiously enough the above consideration in the complex plane can have an interesting connection with an unproven nearly hundred year old conjecture of Poincare. This was, the fact that closed loops could be shrunk to points as happens on the two dimensional surface of a sphere is also valid in three dimensions. Such closed loops defining a simply connected space are described by closed contours in complex space which have an integral value for the index[\cite=r8]. For the surface of the sphere the axes are replaced by great circles and the coordinates by the longitude and latitude. If we now generalise to three dimensions, we end up instead with the above four dimensional Quarternion theory of Hamilton - the three dimensional case is not possible. We have instead three space dimensions, and a fourth dimension, which as seen above can also be recovered from the doubly connected or spinorial behaviour. Interestingly this also provides a rationale for Poincare's conjecture not being provable.
