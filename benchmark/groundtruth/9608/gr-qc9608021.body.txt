Abstract

We consider dilaton-axion gravity interacting with p    U(1) vectors (p = 6 corresponding to N = 4 supergravity) in four-dimensional spacetime admitting a non-null Killing vector field. It is argued that this theory exibits features of a "square" of vacuum General Relativity. In the three-dimensional formulation it is equivalent to a gravity coupled σ-model with the (4 + 2p)-dimensional target space SO(2,2 + p) / (SO(2)  ×  SO(2 + p)). Kähler coordinates are introduced on the target manifold generalising Ernst potentials of General Relativity. The corresponding Kähler potential is found to be equal to the logarithm of the product of the four-dimensional metric component g00 in the Einstein frame and the dilaton factor, independently on presence of vector fields. The Kähler potential is invariant under exchange of the Ernst potential and the complex axidilaton field, while it undergoes holomorphic/antiholomorphic transformations under general target space isometries. The "square" property is also manifest in the two-dimensional reduction of the theory as a matrix generalization of the Kramer-Neugebauer map.

Supergravity is often called a "square root" of General Relativity. Indeed, a supersymmetric extention of the Poincare algebra is reminiscent of the Dirac's procedure of obtaining a spin 1/2 wave equation from the scalar wave equation. A bosonic sector of extended supergravities, apart from the graviton, contains scalar and vector fields. One of the most interesting bosonic structures is suggested by the N = 4 supergravity, which attracted much attention recently in connection with "stringy" black holes [\cite=gi] [\cite=rk4] [\cite=gk] [\cite=cv]. Here we want to discuss the relationship between this theory (often called also dilaton-axion gravity) and vacuum General Relativity and to show that, in a certain sense, it can be viewed as a "square" of the latter.

As far as stationary solutions, like black holes, are concerned (more generally, space-times possessing a non-null Killing vector field), Einstein theory may be reformulated as a three-dimensional gravity coupled non-linear σ-model [\cite=nk]. This theory admits a concise representation in terms of the Ernst potential ε [\cite=er] [\cite=ex], which may be regarded as a complex coordinate on a one-dimensional Kähler manifold SU(1,1) / U(1). Similar representation holds for the dilaton-axion σ-model. The Kähler potential for the target space of the three-dimensional N = 4 supergravity turns out to be equal to the logarithm of the product of potentials of the vacuum gravity and the dilaton-axion system independently on presence of vector fields. For vacuum gravity this potential is simply given by the logarithm of four-dimensional g00. A dilaton exponential plays similar role in the dilaton-axion σ-model possessing the same SU(1,1) / U(1) structure. A square of this coset generates the target space of the pure dilaton-axion gravity, which is enlarged to the manifold SO(2,2 + p) / (SO(2)  ×  SO(2 + p)) when vector fields are included. However, the Kähler potential still preserves its value given by the pure dilaton-axion gravity. This gives rise to various similarities between classical solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton-axion theory and vacuum Einstein equations. One can say that N = 4 supergravity exibits at the same time features of the square root and the square of General Relativity. Apart from this somewhat phylosophical implication, the Kähler representation of the stationary N = 4 supergravity turns out to be very useful in identifying hidden symmetries and generating classical solutions.

Let us recall first the Ernst formulation of the stationary vacuum Einstein equations [\cite=er]. Assuming the spacetime to admit a timelike (in an essential region) Killing vector field, one parametrises the four-dimensional metric through the standard Kaluza-Klein ansatz

[formula]

where the three-space metric hij,  (i,j = 1,2,3), the rotation one-form ωi and the three-dimensional conformal factor f depend on the three-space coordinates xi only. Then it can be shown that the vanishing of the mixed components of the Ricci tensor Ri0 implies the existence of the NUT-potential χ replacing a rotation one-form ω  =  ωidxi via dualization [\cite=iw]

[formula]

where an asterisk stands for the three-dimensional Hodge dual. Together f and χ parametrize a two-dimensional target manifold of the σ-model resulting from dimensional reduction. A Kähler representation is achieved by introducing the following linear combination, the (vacuum) Ernst potential,

[formula]

(more frequently used potential differs from this by i). The corresponding equations of motion define a harmonic map from the three-dimensional space xi to the target manifold endowed with the metric

[formula]

The Kähler metric [formula] is generated by the Kähler potential K

[formula]

for which one obtains the following simple expression

[formula]

Thus the Kähler potential for any stationary solution of the vacuum Einstein equation is directly related to the g00 component of the four-dimensional metric.

Ernst potential act as a source in the three-dimensional Einstein equations for the metric hij

[formula]

Once a solution is found, to restore a four-dimensional metric one has merely to solve a linear equation (2) for the rotation one-form ω. To solve three-dimensional gravity coupled σ-model equations, additional assumptions are needed in general, such as existence of the second space-time Killing field commuting with the first one. In this case, further two-dimensional reduction leads to completely integrable (modified) chiral equations with associated infinite symmetries [\cite=ge]. Another useful technique consists in restricting a functional dependence of all target variables on space coordinates through a unique (several) scalar function [\cite=cl]. However, already information contained in the structure of the target manifold may be helpful in generating new solutions from already known ones. This amounts to using the target space isometries to relate between themselves physically inequivalent field configurations. Then it is important to find a concise representation of symmetry transformations in terms of physical quantities. In General Relativity it was just the Ernst formulation which allowed for considerable simplifications. It is natural therefore to look for similar representation in more general supergravity inspired bosonic theories.

The isometry group of the target manifold is a global symmetry of the system, which maps one classical solution to another. For the vacuum Einstein system (4) it can be written in the SL(2,R) form

[formula]

with real a,b,c,d. This three-parametric group can be conveniently cast into three one-parameter subgroups. The first subgroup is the shift of the complex Ernst potential on a real constant

[formula]

It changes the NUT potential on a constant, what, in view of (2), does not modify the metric. This transformation is thus a pure gauge.

The second subgroup is the recaling of the Ernst potential

[formula]

It preserves the r.h.s. of the three-dimensional Einstein equations (7), but modifies the four-dimensional metric (1), thus producing physically inequivalent field configurations (in particular, transforming asymptotically flat solutions into asymptotically non-flat ones).

To write down the third subgroup one has first to make a discrete transformation: an inversion of the Ernst potential ε  →  ε- 1 (what corresponds to a = d = 0,  b =  - c = 1 in ([\ref=z]) plus change of a sign). After that one just makes a shift on a real constant:

[formula]

This is the Ehlers transformation [\cite=eh], an essential part of the whole group. It is non-linear being expressed in terms of ε, and physically corresponds to mixing of a mass and a NUT charge (gravitational analog of electric-magnetic duality).

The remarkable property of this σ-model is that the target manifold is a symmetric riemannian space. This property opens prospects to get an infinite-dimensional symmetry (Geroch group) [\cite=ge] making further assumption of the existence of the second space-time isometry commuting with the first one (stationary axisymmetric fields, plane waves, non-homogeneous cosmologies etc.). The corresponding symmetry group will be then an affine extension of SL(2,R). Some of its lower-level elements were obtained in various explicit forms as Bäcklund transformations [\cite=bt] and used to generate new exact solutions of Einstein equations. It is worth noting that the most sophysticated known exact solutions belong to this type.

Obviously, hidden symmetry of the stationary vacuum Einstein equations is identical to the S-duality [\cite=sd] of the dilaton-axion system (also SL(2,R)  ~  SU(1,1)), which is a part of the bosonic sector of N = 4,  D = 4 supergravity. Let us consider first the pure dilaton-axion system coupled to gravity (previous discussion of this model can be found in [\cite=bak] [\cite=mah]. Denoting a four-dimensional Peccei-Quinn axion as κ and introducing a complex axidilaton field,

[formula]

one can write the action as follows

[formula]

Clearly the axion-dilaton term has exactly the same symmetries ([\ref=z]) with ε replaced by z. The role of the gauge transformation now is played by the shift of the axion on a constant, while the inversion is related to the strong-weak coupling duality transformation.

These symmetries survive upon reduction to three dimensions. If the condition of stationarity (1) is imposed, the target manifold of the resulting three-dimensional σ-model will be the product of two copies of SU(1,1) / U(1), one in terms of the Ernst potential, and another in terms of z:

[formula]

Now the Kähler metric [formula] is generated by the potential

[formula]

[formula]

The V-potential is given by the product of four-dimensional g00 and the dilaton factor playing similar role in the target space geometry. We observe therefore that the stationary dilaton-axion gravity has a remarkable property of a "square" of vacuum gravity. The reason is simply that the three-dimensional reductions of both the vacuum Einstein gravity and the dilaton-axion system have identical σ-model representations. The coupled system also possesses the "Ernst-axidilaton" duality symmetry under an exchange

[formula]

The situation becomes slightly more complicated when vector fields are included. In three dimensions vector fields can be traded for scalars, and one can expect to get a larger sigma-model with a higher-dimensional target manifold [\cite=bgm]. This is indeed the case, e.g., for the Einstein-Maxwell theory [\cite=nk] [\cite=mg] (bosonic sector of N = 2 supergravity), where one obtains a Kähler target manifold SU(2,1) / (SU(2)  ×  U(1)), as well as for other supergravities and dimensionally reduced Kaliza-Klein theories [\cite=bgm]. We will discuss now the N = 4 supergravity containing a dilaton, an axion, and six abelian vector fields (for the sake of generality we take p vector fields). It turns out that the target manifold is also Kähler, and the corresponding complex coordinates are some generalizations of the Ernst potentials of the Einstein-Maxwell theory. For the model with only one vector field such coordinates were found recently [\cite=diak] [\cite=udu] as providing a convenient parametrization for the Ehlers-Harrison transformations of this theory discovered earlier [\cite=gk] in terms of real varables. When several vector fields are present, the target space is extended rather straightforwardly.

Consider a four-dimensional action

[formula]

where [formula], and the sum over repeated n is understood. For p = 6 this is the bosonic sector of N = 4,D = 4 supergravity. This action is invariant under SO(p) rotations of vector fields, which is an analog of T-duality of dimensionally reduced theories [\cite=gpr]. The equations of motion and Bianchi identities (but not the action) are also invariant under S-duality transformations

[formula]

[formula]

Imposing the stationarity condition (1) one can express vector fields through the electric vn and magnetic un scalar potentials as follows

[formula]

[formula]

In three dimensions the rotation one form ωi plays a role of the graviphoton, and one can show using the standard argument that the "T-duality" group is enlarged to SO(1,p + 1). Also, S-duality becomes the symmetry of the three-dimensional action. Moreover, both these groups turn out to be unified in a larger "U-duality" group SO(2,p + 2) [\cite=gk] [\cite=udu] [\cite=ht]. This can be easily checked by computing the Kähler metric of the resulting target manifold. To find the σ-model representation one has to introduce a NUT potential χ via

[formula]

and to derive the set of equations for χ,un in addition to the equations for f,κ,φ,vn. The full set of equations will be that of the three-dimensional gravity coupled σ-model possessing the 4 + 2p dimensional target space [formula]. One can parametrize the target manifold by complex coordinates zα,  α = 0,1,...,p + 1 which have the following meaning. The components α = n = 1,...,p are complex potentials for vector fields

[formula]

the α = p + 1 component is the complex axidilaton field itself, zp + 1 = z, and

[formula]

is the N = 4 analog of the Ernst potential. Somewhat surprisingly, the Kähler potential, generating the target space metric via (15), remains untouched by the electric and magnetic potentials and preserves its value (16) given by the pure dilaton-axion gravity:

[formula]

Hence, in a sense, the "square" property of the pure dilaton-axion gravity is not destroyed by vectors. At the same time, being expressed through complex coordinates, Kähler potential has non-trivial dependence on all of them, so that the metric of the target space is non-degenerate.

Since the Kähler metric (5) is given by mixed derivatives upon holomorphic and antiholomorphic coordinates, a multiplication of V by an arbitrary holomorphic function and its complex conjugate (to preserve reality of V) does not change the metric. Thus a transformation

[formula]

is the target space isometry. The Ernst-axidilaton duality (17) (with Φn unchanged) belongs trivially to this class. Another useful discrete symmetry corresponds to

[formula]

and consists in the following:

[formula]

Now three-dimensional U-duality transformations SO(2,2 + p) of N = 4 supergravity can be listed in the following way. The most obvious symmetries include p(p - 1) / 2  SO(p) rotations acting only on vector fields, Φ  →  ΩΦ, where ΩTΩ = Ip, as well as 2p + 1 gauge transformations

[formula]

and scale

[formula]

Here [formula] are real scalar and vector group parameters. The remaining elements of the symmetry group include 2p + 1 Harrison-Ehlers transformations, which can be obtained by applying the above discrete maps to (29-32). Namely, applying (17) to the electric gauge (31), one gets an electric Harrison transformation (the corresponding set of parameters will be denoted as [formula]). Acting by (28) on the magnetic gauge (30) and gravitational gauge (29) one obtains a magnetic Harrison ([formula]) and Ehlers (cE) transformations. The full group is closed by the SL(2,R)  S-duality (19) expressed in terms of the target space variables. This three-parametric set can be obtained by applying (17) to gravitational gauge (29), scale (32) and Ehlers transformation.

In the particular case p = 1, due to local isomorphism SL(2,R)  ~  Sp(4,R), there exists a simple matrix generalization of the Ernst potential [\cite=diak]. Let us form the (2  ×  2) symmetric complex matrix collecting Kähler coordinates in the following way

[formula]

One can easily check that the target space metric is reproduced via

[formula]

what is a direct matrix analog of (4). Also, three-dimensional Einstein equations take the form similar to (7):

[formula]

The analogy with the vacuum General Relativity is suggestive to express U-duality transformations in a way similar to (9) - (11) with matrix valued parameters. The gauge transformation (9) now is uplifted to

[formula]

where B is the real matrix of parameters

[formula]

This matrix-valued gauge transformation joins a gravitational gauge (g), magnetic gauge (m) and an axion shift (b) belonging to S-duality (cf. (9)).

The scale transformation (10) now is splitted into a symmetry preserving matrix relation:

[formula]

Apart from the genuin SL(2,R) scale (a), it includes gravitational scale (s), electric gauge (e) and electric Harrison (he) transformations:

[formula]

The last subgroup is the linear shift of an inverted matrix

[formula]

where C is a real symmetric matrix of parameters

[formula]

combining c-transformation of S-duality with magnetic Harrison (hm) and Ehlers (cE) transformations. For pure dilaton-axion gravity without vector fields the matrices B,A,C become diagonal and correspond to the product of two SL(2,R). Dilaton-axion gravity with one vector field generates Sp(4,R) symmetry, as was first found in [\cite=g]. Now to make contact with the Sp(4,R) group, one has merely to decompose the matrix Ernst potential into two symmetric real matrices [\cite=diak]

[formula]

and then construct a 4  ×  4 real matrix

[formula]

This is a symmetric symplectic matrix satisfying

[formula]

In terms of M the metric of the target space reads

[formula]

while the Einstein equations for hij are

[formula]

Similar decomposition of U-duality can be constructed for arbitrary p, but the associated matrix structures are more involved, so we do not pursue this here. Rather, consider one another manifestation of the "square" property of dilaton-axion gravity related to further two-dimensional reduction. If, in addition to stationarity, an assumption of axial symmetry is made (more generally, that of existence of two commuting spacetime Killing vectors), the rotation one form in (1) will have the only non-zero component ωφ  =  ω corresponding to rotation along the symmetry axis, while the three-metric can be written in the Lewis-Papapetrou gauge

[formula]

Then γ dissapears from the dynamical equations for the σ-model variables which now take the form of a modified chiral matrix equation [\cite=g]

[formula]

This can serve as a standard input for an application of of integrable systems techniques [\cite=ge] [\cite=bt]. A Lax representation can be written straightforwardly in terms of M. Vacuum Einstein theory is a particular case of this system with φ  =  κ = v = u = 0. In that case there exists an alternative chiral equation involving another matrix F which is expressed directly through f and ω. Since ω and the NUT potential are related non-locally via (2), M and F representations are essentially different. Meanwhile a point-like relation between two pairs f,χ and f,ω exists, known as Kramer-Neugebauer (KN) map, which transforms M-equations into F-equations and vice-versa. This map is particularly helpful in obtaining the elements of the Geroch group explicitly. The F-representation for dilaton-axion gravity was found in [\cite=bdg]:

[formula]

Here Ω is a real symmetric matrix

[formula]

a = Aφ is the spatial component of the vector potential, and β = B0φ is the component of the Kalb-Ramond field (which was at the origin of κ). Matrix Ω generalises ω of General Relativity, P replaces the scalar f, while Q, entering (43), is a matrix analog of (minus) χ. Similarly to (two-dimensional reduction of) (2), there exists a non-local relation between Q and Ω :

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] are two-dimensional Hodge dual operators. Now, the local map between M and F is realised by

[formula]

To see this it is sufficient to write down equations for P, Q and P, Ω pairs following from equations (48) for M and F [\cite=bdg]. The relation (52) is a direct "matrix square" of the original KN map χ  →   - iω,  f  →  ρ / f. Note, that in the both cases i does not imply complexification, but needed just to accomodate different signature of cosets relevant to two alternative representations. Similar KN map exists for arbitrary number p of vector fields. For p = 0 it was given earlier in [\cite=kum], the application of the integrable systems techniques to this case was recently discussed by Bakas [\cite=bak2].

To summarize: coupling of the dilaton-axion system to gravity leads to a three-dimensional σ-model with a Kähler target manifold being a "square" of the corresponding General Relativity manifold. When vector fields are added, the Kähler potential still preserves its value given by the product of Ernst and axidilaton Kähler potentials. This gives rise to various manifestations of the square property of the N = 4 supergravity with respect to General Relativity and provides new tools in the search of clasical solutions to this theory.
