Abstract

Completely entangled quantum states are shown to factorize into tensor products of entangled states whose dimensions are powers of prime numbers. The entangled states of each prime-power dimension transform among themselves under a finite Heisenberg group. We consider processes in which factors are exchanged between entangled states and study canonical ensembles in which these processes occur. It is shown that the Riemann zeta function is the appropriate partition function and that the Riemann hypothesis makes a prediction about the high temperature contribution of modes of large dimension. Completely entangled quantum states are of considerable interest not only in the foundations of quantum mechanics[\cite=FIVa] [\cite=FIVb], but also because of the possibility of their use in secure communication schemes[\cite=BEN] [\cite=WOOT]. It has been shown[\cite=FIVc] that any completely entangled two-particle state is expressible in the following form: Let [formula] be any basis of a Hilbert space of dimension N. Here ν  =  1,2 is usually taken to be a particle label, but more generally it may label any pair of Hilbert spaces of the same dimension. Let U indicate an arbitrary anti-unitary transformation on the N-dimensional Hilbert space and define

[formula]

Then the state

[formula]

is a completely entangled state. In this state there is equal likelihood of finding particle-1 in any state |x,1〉, but it is certain that it will be found in this state if its partner is found in the state |xU,2〉. Note that our use of the same letter U to label both the entangled state and the operator that appears on the right is justified by the fact that the right side is independent of the choice of basis. This fact (which makes essential use of the anti-unitarity) is what produces the perfect correlation for any choice of |x,1〉.

There is no way to write an entangled state |U〉 in the form of a monomial tensor product of a state in the ν  =  1 space with a state in the ν  =  2 space. However, let us take note of a structure that can be illustrated by the following example: Suppose N = 6 and the the six states [formula] correspond to the values of the pair n = (n',n'') where n'  =  1,2 indexes a two dimensional Hilbert space of "spin", and n'' = 1,2,3 a three dimensional space of "color". Then each state |n,ν〉 can be written in the form:

[formula]

If U is expressible in the form:

[formula]

where the operators on the right are anti-unitary transformations in the spin and color spaces respectively we have:

[formula]

with

[formula]

[formula]

Thus while the state |U〉 does not factorize with respect to the particle label ν, it does factorize with respect to the two properties. Moreover the factorization is into a tensor product of two states that are also completely entangled states. Examples of the same sort can obviously be produced for arbitrary non-prime N and any number of factors.

If N is a non-prime the question then arises as to when the Hilbert space decomposes into a tensor product. Such a factorization implies that all linear (or anti-linear) transformations are expressible as tensor products of operators belonging to the factors, i.e. we are only allowed to consider operations in which the factors transform among themselves with no interference between distinct factors. Conversely, if all physically implementable transformations in the system of interest can be constructed from tensor products then the space will be representable as a tensor product.

Thus to permit factorization we must show that there is a set of operators that is large enough to characterize all interesting physical processes, but small enough to be expressible as tensor products of operators associated with the factor dimensions. Since we confine ourselves to entangled states, we need only consider transformations that take entangled states into one another. In particular if we restrict to a complete set of entangled states of any dimension N, we need only consider operators that transform the set among one another and these form a finite group. The structure of such transformations has been previously analyzed by the author [\cite=FIVc], and is as follows: The Heisenberg group GN is defined abstractly as the group generated by σ,τ,I where I is the identity and

[formula]

It can be represented in a Hilbert space H of dimension N with basis [formula] by:

[formula]

The N2 operators [formula] of GN acting on either particle cause the entangled state to hop from one point of an N  ×  N lattice to another. This lattice resembles a phase space in which σ and τ act like a coordinate and momentum generator. In the case where N is a prime p it is known [\cite=FIVc] that Gp is the only group with p2 elements that will cause a complete set of mutually orthogonal entangled states to transform among themselves. More generally finite groups that transform sets of N2 linearly-independent entangled states of dimension N among themselves will be direct products of Heisenberg groups [formula] where [formula] and each factor is a prime power. To understand why it is possible that a Heisenberg group of prime-power order may not decompose further one need only compare the groups Gp2 and Gp  ×  Gp both of which have the same number of elements. In the construction of GN one needs the N'th roots of unity (see (7) above). If N  =  pq with distinct primes p,q then every N'th root of unity is a product of some p'th and some q'th root of unity, a property that disappears if p  =  q.

We see then that the Heisenberg group supplies us with a set of operations sufficiently large to transform a complete system of entangled states into one another, and, moreover, is represented in the tensor product Hilbert space. Thus we are able to describe the physics of a complete system of entangled states of non-prime dimension via the tensor product of entangled states whose dimensions are prime power factors of N.

The factorization property naturally suggests that we consider ensembles of entangled states which interact by exchanging factors, e.g. an N1  =  6 state interacting with an N2  =  4 state to form an N3 = 12 and an N4 = 2 state. In such interactions the sum of the logarithms of the dimensions is the additive conserved quantity. Hence the partition function of a canonical ensemble will be:

[formula]

which is the Riemann zeta function. Using the Euler product formula

[formula]

one then computes the expectation value of <   log N >  in this ensemble to be

[formula]

[formula]

where

[formula]

At low temperatures (large β) only the low values of N contribute, and in the extreme case T = 0 we have only N  =  1 i.e. a completely factorized state. Thus entanglement disappears at T  =  0.

The high temperature (low β) limit is more interesting. Here the large values of N contribute, and the partition function has a simple pole at β  =  1 indicating a phase transition. A rigorous way to study the β  →  0 behavior is by analytic continuation which involves one in a study of the zeros of the zeta function in the critical strip 0  <  Re(β)  <  1. However, we can expose part of the physical content of the high temperature behavior in the following simpler manner: For any x and β consider the quantity:

[formula]

which measures the average contribution to the expectation value in (9) coming from the modes associated with N  ≤  x. For β  →  1 the series diverges only logarithmically as x  →    ∞   so that the average contribution measured by f still goes to zero indicating that there is not yet complete dominance of the high N modes. This situation changes, however, as β  →  0. To see how this dominance develops we examine the asymptotic behavior of:

[formula]

Before doing so we remark on the significance of this function in number theory: One can show that the number π(x) of primes less than x has asymptotic behavior[\cite=RAD] given by ψ(x) /  log x. In fact the usual proof of the prime number theorem (which tells us the leading asymptotic behavor) is carried out by showing that

[formula]

Thus the corrections to the prime number theorem are obtained from a study of the asymptotic behavior of r(x). The importance of the Riemann hypothesis concerning the distribution of the zeros of the zeta function derives from the fact that if it is true one can derive the strongest possible asymptotic estimate for r(x) namely:

[formula]

In the context of our analysis of the high temperature behavior, we see that the Riemann hypothesis implies that fo(x) defined by (13) has the asymptotic form:

[formula]

and thus makes a prediction about the asymptotic high temperature distribution of modes in ensembles of entangled states.

In an earlier part of the discussion we took note of the fact that there is a non-uniqueness in the factorization of entangled states of dimension N when any of the prime factors occur to powers higher than the first. It is thus of interest to consider ensembles in which this does not happen, i.e. in which only those integers are permitted whose prime factors are at most of the first power. Since the primes label the possible entanglement modes, one sees that such a restricted ensemble has a fermionic character, while with unrestricted N it has a bosonic character. In the restricted case the partition function is expressed as the Euler product:

[formula]

which may be contrasted with (10). In terms of zeta functions it is:

[formula]

The β  →  0 limit of Zf is evidently quite interesting and will be examined elsewhere.

The appearance of Heisenberg groups in the analysis of completely entangled states is, with the benefit of hindsight, not surprising. The essential property of such states is to transfer operations on one particle to its partner, and this leads to an isomorphism between a translation group and its dual (character group). It is this isomorphism that is the defining property of Heisenberg groups in general.

The above discussion points to a number of lines of inquiry: On the practical side the connection of the physics of entangled states with prime factorization may be of interest in quantum computing. On the theoretical side one may try to do with entangled states what one does with prime numbers, i.e. extend the field and thereby factorize what was previously unfactorizable. Thus p = 2 and primes of the form p  =  4n + 1 become non-primes when the integers are complexified, e.g. 5  =  (2  +  i)(2  -  i). Since p = 5 is the Hilbert space of spin 2, it would be particularly interesting to discover an analagous factorization process for p = 5 entangled states.
