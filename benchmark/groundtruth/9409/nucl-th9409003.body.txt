ABSTRACT

Introduction

The quarks that enter into nuclei and hence figure in nuclear physics are the u(p), d(own) and possibly s(trange) quarks. These are called "chiral quarks" since they are very light at the scale of strong interactions. Both the u and d quarks are less than 10 MeV, much less than the relevant scale which I will identify with the vector meson (say, ρ) mass ~  1 GeV. The s quark is in the range of 130 to 180 MeV, so it is not quite light. In some sense, it may be classified as "heavy" as in the Skyrme model for hyperons but the success with current algebras involving kaons also indicates that it can be considered as chiral as the u and d are. In this talk, I will consider the s quark in the same category although the results based on the lightness assumption may not be very accurate.

If the quark masses are zero, the QCD Lagrangian has chiral symmetry SU(nf)  ×  SU(nf) where nf is the number of massless flavors. However we know that this symmetry in the world we are living in, namely at low temperature (T) and low density (ρ), is spontaneously broken to SU(nf)V giving rise to Goldstone bosons denoted π, the pions for nf = 2, the pions, kaons and η for nf = 3. In nature, the quark masses are not strictly zero, so the chiral symmetry is explicitly broken by the masses, and the bosons are pseudo-Godstones with small mass. Again in the u and d sector, the pion is very light ~  140 MeV but in the strange sector, the kaon is not so light, ~  500 MeV. Nonetheless we will pretend that we have good chiral symmetry and rectify our mistakes by adding symmetry breaking terms treated in a suitable way.

The theme of this talk is then that most of what happens in nuclei are strongly controlled by this symmetry pattern. Indeed, it was argued many years ago[\cite=rhobrown81] that chiral symmetry should play a crucial role in many nuclear processes, much more than confinement and asymptotic freedom - the other basic ingredients of QCD - would. More recently, it has become clear that much of what we can understand of the fundamental nucleon structure also follows from chiral symmetry and its breaking. This was also anticipated sometime ago[\cite=brtoday] [\cite=br-comm88].

In this talk, I would like to tell you more recent and quite exciting new development in this line of work which suggests that the old idea, quite vague at the beginning, is becoming a viable model of QCD in many-body nuclear systems.

Nucleon: The Chiral Bag in QCD

The chiral bag was formulated originally in a somewhat as hoc way based solely on chiral symmetry but there is a striking indication[\cite=mattis] [\cite=manohar] that it follows from a more general argument based on large Nc QCD where Nc is the number of colors. Let me discuss this as a model for nucleon structure.

When chiral symmetry is implemented to the bag model of the hadrons[\cite=br-comm88] [\cite=chodos], it was found necessary to introduce pion fields outside of the bag of radius R in which quarks are "confined." This is because otherwise the axial current cannot be conserved. Furthermore, it was discovered[\cite=rgb83] that to be consistent with non-perturbative structure, the pion field takes the form of the skyrmion configuration with a fractional baryon charge residing in the pion cloud. This implied that the quarks are not strictly confined in the sense of the MIT bag but various charges leak out. It became clear that the bag radius is not a physical variable. That physics should not depend upon the size of the bag has been formulated as a "Cheshire Cat Principle" (CCP). In fact the CCP may be stated as a gauge principle[\cite=damgaardCCP] with the bag taken as a gauge fixing. What this meant was that the skyrmion is just a chiral bag whose radius is "gauge-chosen" to be shrunk to a point.

The recent development[\cite=mattis] [\cite=manohar] is closer to the core of QCD. In large Nc QCD, meson-meson interactions become weak but meson-baryon Yukawa interactions become strong going like N1 / 2c. In this limit, the baryon is heavy and hence can be treated as a static source localized at the origin. Other interactions, such as mass splittings etc. are down by a factor of Nc. Thus we have to add to the usual current algebra Lagrangian of O(Nc) which I will denote Lca a term of the form[\cite=manohar]

[formula]

where Xia is the baryon axial current in the large Nc limit and Aia is the pion axial current. It is found that summing an infinite class of Feynman diagrams in the leading Nc order corresponds to solving coupled classical field equations given by the leading order Lagrangian Lca  +  δL. This produces a baryon source coupled with a classical meson cloud, with quantum corrections obtained by performing semiclassical expansion around the classical meson background. This is precisely the picture described by the chiral bag[\cite=rgb83].

There are two aspects of this result which are important for later purpose:

It is conjectured - and seems highly plausible - that there is a line of UV fixed points in the large Nc renormalization group flow of the parameters of the Lagrangian[\cite=mattis]. The bag radius can be one of those parameters. If correct, one may formulate CCP in terms of the "fixed line."

The m3π (or m3 / 2q) (where mπ is the pion mass and mq the quark mass) non-analytic correction to the baryon mass that is found in the classical solution is identical to a loop correction in chiral perturbation theory[\cite=manohar]. This makes a direct link between the chiral bag and chiral perturbation theory (χPT) to a higher chiral order.

Chiral Perturbation Theory for Nuclei

As suggested above, the chiral bag links QCD to an effective Lagrangian consisting of mesons and baryons. Here I will consider the u- and d-quark system which provides a very nearly chirally symmetric situation. At low energy, QCD then can be translated into chiral perturbation theory. χPT is an expansion in derivatives and quark masses and this is known to be very successful in describing ππ interactions[\cite=leutwyler]. In the presence of baryon fields, there is a complication because of the baryon mass which is of order of the chiral scale Λχ  ~  1 GeV. In the pion sector, the expansion in ∂  /  Λχ and μmq  /  Λ2χ (where μ is a scale parameter) is all we need to do. However the derivative ∂ acting on the baryon field is of order of the baryon mass which is not small compared with Λχ. One way out is to use the heavy-baryon formalism of Jenkins and Manohar[\cite=JMHBF] which amounts to redefining the baryon field by

[formula]

This eliminates the mass mB when the derivative is taken, leaving small residual momentum. This is an approximation that is clearly valid if the baryon is very massive and propagates nearly on-shell. This amounts to an additional expansion in power of 1 / mB. The leading term in the expansion is just the familiar static approximation.

As we saw above, the chiral bag structure anchored on large Nc QCD and χPT with a heavy-baryon chiral Lagrangian describe the same physics for the single baryon. We do not know how to use the chiral bag for nuclei and nuclear matter but we are beginning to know how to do a systematic χPT for nuclear systems. One may say that doing χPT is tantamount to doing QCD for nuclear physics.

The formalism has been applied to the calculation of nuclear forces starting from a chiral Lagrangian that contains only the nucleon and pion fields[\cite=vankolck]. Going to one-loop order and using a momentum cut-off, one can reasonably understand low-energy nucleon-nucleon interactions up to ~  100 MeV.

Here I would like to show the power of chiral Lagrangians in describing exchange currents. One can formulate the same for electromagnetic exchange currents but here I will confine the discussion to axial charge transitions in nuclei.

Consider the β transition between nucleus A and nucleus B of the type

[formula]

where I is isospin. This transition goes mainly through the time component of the axial current, Ji50. Warburton studied this transition in the mass range A = 205 - 208 with a surprising result[\cite=warburton]. Denote the matrix element of the single particle operator associated with the axial charge by M1 and the experimentally extracted matrix element by Mexp. Then the observation was that[\cite=warburton]

[formula]

Now the single-particle matrix elements are pretty carefully calculated, so this big discrepancy cannot be in the nuclear wave functions. The conclusion was that the operator must be deficient. How do we explain this?

The explanation was given many years ago[\cite=kubodera] but without a good understanding. It is only recently that a fully satisfactory answer was found in terms of χ PT[\cite=parketal].

As shown by Weinberg in the case of nuclear forces[\cite=weinberg], if one uses the heavy-baryon formalism, three-body and higher-body currents do not contribute to next-to-leading order χPT (corresponding to one loop) and hence we are left with only two-body corrections. Furthermore to leading order, we have only the two diagrams of Fig.[\ref=softpi] involving one-pion exchange with point-like vertices. For the axial-charge process, it is even simpler since the diagram (b) vanishes by G-parity. Let us call this soft-pion exchange contribution Msoft2. Now next to the leading order, there are many diagrams that can contribute in general but for the axial charge transition, only a few graphs survive. They are given in Fig.[\ref=nextorder]. These are rather simple to compute and are worked out by Park et al.[\cite=parketal]. The result is that

[formula]

with

[formula]

where the subscript represents the n = 1,2-body operator. It is found that to a good accuracy and almost independently of mass number,

[formula]

Thus the loop corrections are indeed quite small. Thus for the transition involved, the soft-pion term dominates. A very similar situation holds for the magnetic dipole process like the thermal np capture n + p  →  d + γ and seems to hold also for the process e + d  →  e + n + p even to a large momentum transfer. This dominance of the soft-pion process in the cases considered was called "chiral filter phenomenon." Calculation of the soft-pion term with realistic wave functions[\cite=ptk94] gives a large ratio

[formula]

enough to explain the experimental value ([\ref=warburton]). This is the clearest indication that the pion cloud plays a crucial role in nuclear processes.

"Swelled" Hadrons in Medium

The effective chiral Lagrangian I discussed so far is a Lagrangian that results when the degrees of freedom lying above the chiral scale Λχ are eliminated by "mode integration." As one increases the matter density or heats the matter, the scale changes, so we can ask the following question: If a particle moves in a background with a matter density ρ and/or temperature T, what is the effective Lagrangian applicable in this background? One possible approach is to take a theory defined at zero T and zero ρ and compute what happens as T or ρ increases. This is the approach nuclear physicists have been using all along. However now we know that the major problem with QCD is that the vacuum is very complicated and we are not sure that by doing the standard approach we are actually describing the vacuum correctly as T or ρ goes up. Since the quark condensate 〈q〉 is a vacuum property and it changes as one changes T or ρ, it may be more profitable to change the vacuum appropriate to the given T or ρ and build an effective theory built on the changed vacuum. This is the idea of Brown and Rho[\cite=brscaling] in introducing scaled parameters in the effective Lagrangian.

If the quarks are massless, then the QCD Lagrangian is scale-invariant but quantum mechanically a scale is generated giving rise to the trace anomaly. In the vacuum, we have in addition to the quark condensate 〈q〉 the gluon condensate 〈GμνGμν〉. We can associate a scalar field χ to the G2 field as G2  ~  χ4 and introduce the χ field into the effective Lagrangian to account for the conformal anomaly of QCD. The χ field can be decomposed roughly into two components, one "smooth" low frequency component and the other "non-smooth" high-frequency component. The former can be associated with 2-π, 4-π etc. fluctuations and the latter with a scalar glueball. For low-energy processes we are interested in, we can integrate out the high-energy component and work with the low-energy one. How this is to be done is explained in [\cite=adamibrown]. The outcome of this operation is that one can write the same form of the effective Lagrangian as in free space with the parameters of the theory scaled as

[formula]

The nucleon effective mass scaled somewhat differently

[formula]

In these equations the asterisk stands for in-medium quantity. Now in the skyrmion model, at the mean-field level, [formula] does not scale, so the nucleon will also scale as ([\ref=brscaling1]). It turns out that the pion properties do not scale; the pion mass remains unchanged in medium at low T and ρ. Thus if one of the ratios in ([\ref=brscaling1]) is determined either by theory or by experiment, then the scaling is completely defined. At densities up to nuclear matter density, the scaling is roughly

[formula]

where ρ0 is the normal nuclear matter density.

Now given the Lagrangian with the scaled parameters, we can go on and do loop corrections. One of the first things that one finds is that the [formula] gets reduced to ~  1 in nuclear matter from 1.26 in free space. So one would have to do the whole thing in a consistent way. However the point is that most of the processes in nuclear physics are dominated by tree-order diagrams and this means that the effective Lagrangian with the scaled parameters should be predictive without further corrections. Indeed this has been what has been found. In a recent paper, Brown, Buballa, Li and Wambach[\cite=BBLW] use this "BR scaling" to explain simultaneously the new deep inelastic muon scattering experiment and Drell-Yan experiments.

A set of rather clear predictions has been made in this theory.[\cite=adamibrown] [\cite=elafmr]

Chiral Symmetry Restoration: The Georgi Vector Limit

Naively pushed to the extreme, the BR scaling says that all the light-quark hadron masses fall to zero as T or ρ reaches the chiral phase transition point. Lattice gauge calculations are not yet in a position to say anything about the high density regime but can tell us what happens at high T: At T = Tc  ≈  140 MeV, chiral symmetry gets restored.

Here is what we think happens in terms of the effective theory that I have described[\cite=br94]. At low T, we know that chiral SU(2)  ×  SU(2) is broken down to SU(2)V, so chiral symmetry is realized non-linearly in the coset space SU(2)  ×  SU(2) / SU(2). Now one can introduce a hidden gauge symmetry[\cite=bando] and build an equivalent linear theory global  ×  SU(2)local. Here we have, in addition to pions and constituent quarks or nucleons, vector mesons ρ which are now gauge particles. (One can extend the symmetry to include the ω meson.)

The ρ mass in this theory is given by the well-known KSRF relation

[formula]

where κ is a temperature-dependent parameter which at zero temperature takes the value - 1 / 2, g is the hidden gauge coupling and gρππ is the ρππ coupling constant. Perturbative calculation suggests that as T approaches Tc, there is an ultraviolet fixed point, κ  →  0.[\cite=harada] Georgi suggested that in this limit, the SU(2)  ×  SU(2) symmetry is restored but in a mode different from the usual Wigner mode[\cite=georgi]. Now the SU(2)  ×  SU(2) symmetry here is realized by the fact that the decay constants fπ

[formula]

and fS

[formula]

satisfy

[formula]

In this scheme, there are two sets of Goldstone bosons, one set of pseudoscalars (pions) and another set of scalars (S). For g  ≠  0 and fπ  ≠  0, the ρ is massive, so the S bosons make up the longitudinal components of the massive ρ. Thus the symmetry ([\ref=mended]) in this situation resembles Weinberg's "mended symmetry" [\cite=weinbergMS].

The same perturbative calculation indicates that near Tc, the hidden gauge coupling g  →  0. Georgi calls this the vector limit. In this limit, the ρ becomes massless, the S bosons are liberated and become degenerate with the pions. Since the gauge coupling goes to zero, the gauge symmetry disappears and the local symmetry gets swelled to global SU(2)  ×  SU(2). Georgi proposed this symmetry as possibly a large Nc limit of QCD and that the deviation from the vector limit be treated as perturbation. What we are proposing here is that this is a limit realized at the chiral phase transition temperature Tc.

Are there evidences that this is the correct scenario?

We suggest three observations[\cite=br94]:

Quark number susceptibility

Lattice gauge calculations[\cite=gottlieb] show that both isoscalar and isovector quark-number susceptibilities  increase steeply from very small value below Tc to near free-quark value above Tc. This can be understood simply if the vector mesons decouple from the quarks across the transition temperature. Such a mechanism was suggested by Kunihiro[\cite=kunihiro] in the context of the NJL model. The Georgi vector limit provides a concrete description of what might be happening. The result is shown in Fig.[\ref=gottliebchi] where the prediction is compared with the lattice results.

Cool kaons in AGS heavy-ion collisions

The recent preliminary data[\cite=stachel] on the 14.6 GeV collision (experiment E-814)

[formula]

showed cool components with effective temperature of 12 MeV for K+ and 10 MeV for K-. This cannot be reproduced in the conventional scenarios employed in event generators where one finds kaons of effective temperature ~  150 MeV.

It is known experimentally that the freeze-out temperature of hadrons is about 140 MeV which is about the same as the lattice result of the chiral transition temperature Tc. This suggests that the freeze-out for less strongly interacting particles other than the pion and the nucleon is at a temperature higher than Tc and that the pion and nucleon freeze out at about Tc. This means that interactions in the interior of the fireball will be at temperature greater than Tc.

Another point is that the fireball must expand slowly. The slow expansion results because the pressure in the region for some distance above Tc is very low [\cite=kochbrown], the energy in the system going into decondensing gluons rather than giving pressure.

Now what do we expect? As described later, χPT to one-loop order predicts that there are essentially three mechanisms that play an important role in kaon-nuclear interactions: (1) the ω meson exchange giving rise to repulsion for K+N interactions and attraction for K-N; (2) the "sigma-term" attraction for both K±N: (3) the repulsive "virtual pair term." Roughly the vector-exchange gives the repulsion for K+ (and an attraction of somewhat more magnitude for K-)

[formula]

where ρ0 is nuclear matter density. This term is proportional to the hidden gauge coupling g2. One can estimate the scalar attraction by the "sigma term" (which is the same for both K±)

[formula]

where ρs is the scalar density and ΣKN is the KN sigma term. The virtual pair term (proportional to ω2 where ω is the kaon frequency) - which is related to Pauli blocking - removes, at zero temperature, about 60 % of the attraction ([\ref=attraction]). At low temperature, the net effect is therefore highly repulsive for K+N interactions.

Now what happens as T is equal or greater than Tc is as follows. First of all, part of the virtual pair repulsion gets "boiled" off as discussed in [\cite=BKR]. What is more important, if the Georgi vector limit is relevant, then the vector mesons decouple with g  →  0, killing off the repulsion ([\ref=repulsion]). As a consequence, the residual attraction from the scalar exchange remains. This residual attraction combined with the high freeze-out temperature is responsible for the cool components of K±.

A recent calculation of Koch[\cite=koch] which effectively models the mechanism described here supports this scenario. Given that the vector coupling is absent, one can see that both K+ and K- will have a similar cool component.

Instanton-molecule model for chiral phase transition

As a final case, we mention a microscopic model that seems to realize the Georgi vector symmetry at high temperature.

In a model where the chiral phase transition is described as a change in the instanton liquid from a randomly distributed phase at low temperature to an instanton-anti-instanton molecular phase above Tc, it has been observed[\cite=schafer] that the molecules get polarized in the time direction and the interactions in the pion and the longitudinal vector channel become identical. This leads to the degeneracy of the triplets of π and [formula] which may be identified with the scalar S. The interaction in the longitudinal vector-meson channel becomes equally strong as attraction in the scalar-pseudoscalar channel, while transversely polarized vector mesons have no interaction. If one assumes that the polarized molecules are the dominant agent for interactions above Tc, then one can see that all coupling constants in an NJL-type effective Lagrangian so generated could be specified in terms of a single coupling constant, implying the swelling of the symmetry in a manner closely paralleling the Georgi vector symmetry. In this case, the restored symmetry is U(2)  ×  U(2) since the axial U(1)A is also supposed to be restored. Perturbative QCD effects are not expected to modify this symmetry structure but it is not clear that no other non-perturbative effects can enter to upset this. Nonetheless this is a microscopic picture consistent with the Georgi vector symmetry.

Kaon Condensation in "Nuclear Stars"

So far I have been concerned with the up and down quark hadrons. I shall consider the case where the strange quark comes in directly. Because of its non-negligible mass, low-order χPT is probably unreliable, so one would have to go at least to the next order. This is what I will do here in connection with the condensation of kaons in dense nuclear matter.

Kaon condensation is relevant to stellar collapse to compact stars, customarily called "neutron stars." We shall see that "nuclear star" would be a more appropriate nomenclature for this object.

K- condensation was originally predicted by Kaplan and Nelson which was further supported by Politzer and Wise [\cite=knpw]. This was however done in tree order in χPT. Now tree-order χPT does not describe low-energy kaon-nucleon scattering correctly and hence is a suspect when it comes to kaon condensation which involves off-shell extrapolation.

What I want to report here is a next-to-next-to-leading order calculation which describes correctly both kaon-nucleon scattering near threshold and kaon-nuclear interactions "seen" in kaonic atoms[\cite=LJMR] [\cite=LBR] [\cite=LBMR].

Dimensional counting of Feynman diagrams using the effective Lagrangian in heavy-baryon formalism allows one to classify each diagram for the amplitude KN  →  KN with the integer

[formula]

where L is the number of loops, di is the number of derivatives acting in the ith vertex and ni the number of baryon lines entering the ith vertex. Thus the dominant term is the one with no loop involving one derivative of the form

[formula]

This term with ν = 1 is essentially the ω-meson exchange between the K and N, the sign change representing the G-parity of the kaon involved. This is the driving term for generating the Λ(1405) state in K-p scattering. At the next order with ν = 2 involving no loops, there are two terms. One is the "sigma" term proportional to the quark mass matrix

[formula]

which is attractive for both K± channels. The other ν = 2 term is the two-derivative term at tree order,

[formula]

which is repulsive for both K± in the s-wave channel. Now loop terms bring in the factor 2L into ν, so at one loop order, the lowest contribution is given by L = 1 with the Lagrangian ([\ref=L1]). To the same order, there are four-Fermi interactions contributing to the energy density of the matter. It turns out that both one loop and four-Fermi interaction terms are considerably smaller than the tree-order contributions. In particular, the Λ(1405) which plays an essential role for threshold K-N interactions is irrelevant in the condensation phenomenon. Consequently the net effect is then qualitatively controlled by the three mechanisms ([\ref=L1])-([\ref=L2]). This is just what Kaplan and Nelson employed to predict the kaon condensation.

What happens physically is then as follows. In the collapse of a massive star, as the matter is compressed, the electron chemical potential goes up as the density piles up. Because of the attractive interaction for K- which increases as density increases, the kaon mass effectively falls. At some point, it becomes kinematically possible for the electron to decay

[formula]

If K- can condense, the decay can take place copiously. The charge is neutralized by the protons, so when the kaons are condensed, the system becomes more like a nuclear matter than neutron matter. It seems thus proper to call a compact star resulting from this process a "nuclear star."

The detailed calculation made by Lee et al[\cite=LBMR] predicts that K- mesons will condense at

[formula]

where ρ0 is the ordinary nuclear matter density [formula]. This falls in the range of density where interesting astrophysical phenomena such as the formation of mini black holes as suggested by Brown and Bethe[\cite=brownbethe] can take place.
