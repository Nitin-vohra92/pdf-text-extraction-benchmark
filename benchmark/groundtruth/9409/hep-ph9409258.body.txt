It is well known that the process b  →  sγ is extremely sensitive to new physics beyond the Standard Model. In 1993, the CLEO collaboration placed an upper limit on the inclusive b  →  sγ decay B(b  →  sγ) < 5.4  ×  10- 4 at 95% C.L.[\cite=cleo2]. This has inspired a large number of papers[\cite=Hew]. It has been argued that this experiment provides more information about restrictions on the Standard Model, 2-Higgs doublet model, Supersymmetry, Technicolor and etc. Recently CLEO has measured the inclusive branching ratio to be[\cite=cleo]

[formula]

Corresponding to 95% confidence level, the range is 1  ×  10- 4  <  Br(b  →  sγ) < 4  ×  10- 4. More stringent constraints are obtained by experiments, so more accurate theoretical calculation of this decay rate is needed.

The radiative b quark decay has already been calculated in many papers[\cite=Springer] [\cite=Mis] [\cite=Cho]. It is found to be strongly QCD-enhanced. In other words, the strong interaction plays an important role in this decay. However, there are still some uncertainties in these papers. Most papers[\cite=Springer] [\cite=Mis] do not include the QCD running from mtop to MW. Since the top quark is found to be heavier than W boson( mtop  =  174  ±  10+ 13- 12 GeV [\cite=D0] ), it needs a detailed calculation of this effect. Ref.[\cite=Cho] does include this running, however there are some errors in calculation of anomalous dimensions which may lead to some changes in final result.

In our present paper, by using effective field theory formalism[\cite=Georgi], we recalculate the b  →  sγ decay in Minimal Standard Model. We first integrate out the top quark, generating an effective five-quark theory. By using the renormalization group equation, we run the effective field theory down to the W-scale, including QCD corrections from mtop to MW, and correct some errors in ref.[\cite=Cho]. Then the weak bosons are removed. Untruncated anomalous dimensions of QCD running from MW to mb are used. Finally we calculate the rate of radiative b decay.

The effective Hamiltonian is written as

[formula]

The operators Oi make a complete basis of dimension-6 operators:

[formula]

The coefficients Ci(μ = mt) are calculated from matching diagrams, and agree with ref.[\cite=Cho].

After evaluating the loop diagrams, we find that the weak mixing of operators agrees with ref.[\cite=Cho]. While the QCD anomalous dimensions for each of the operators in our basis are

[formula]

[formula]

Comparing with ref.[\cite=Cho], there are some differences in the anomalous dimension matrix, which may lie in omiting a symmetric factor of 1/2 in ref.[\cite=Cho] in calculating Feynman diagram like Fig.1. And some changes may due to miscalculation.

After these changes, the whole matrix can be easily diagonalized, and gives all real eigenvalues while that in ref.[\cite=Cho] can not. Inserting anomalous dimension ([\ref=anom1])([\ref=anom2]) to the renormalization group equation satisfied by the coefficient functions Ci(μ)

[formula]

we can have the coefficients of operators at μ = MW. And some of these operators change a lot from ref.[\cite=Cho] due to our improvements.

In order to continue running the basis operator coefficients down to lower scales, one must integrate out the weak gauge bosons and would-be Goldstone bosons at μ = MW scale. This leads to the well-known six four-quark operators[\cite=Springer] [\cite=Mis]. The other remaining two-quark operators can be reduced by using equations of motion(EOM) to the gluon and photon magnetic moment operators O2LR and O3LR.

To be comparable with previous results, we rewrite our operators O3LR, O2LR as O7, O8 like ref.[\cite=Mis],

[formula]

For completeness, we give the explicit expressions of the coefficient of operator O8 and O7 at μ = M-W,

[formula]

[formula]

They are expressed by coefficients of operators at μ = mt and QCD coupling αs. So it is convenient to utilize these formula.

The obvious differences from QCD correction to C7(MW) and C8(MW) can easily be seen from Fig.2. In comparison to ref.[\cite=Cho], the enhancement of coefficient of operator O7 is almost the same size, but the values for O8 are quite different. Here the effect to O8 is an enhancement rather than a suppression as in ref.[\cite=Cho]. These changes come from the corrections of anomalous dimensions described earlier. Since C7(MW) and C8(MW) are both the input of the following QCD running from MW to mb, it is expected to change the final result.

The running of the coefficients of operators from μ = MW to μ = mb was well described in ref.[\cite=Mis]. After this running we have the coefficients of operators at μ = mb scale. Here we use MW = 80.22GeV, mb = 4.9GeV. Both C7(mb) and C8(mb) are enhanced in comparison to values obtained by Misiak where the QCD corrections from MW to mt are neglected[\cite=Mis].

The leading order b  →  sγ matrix element of Heff is given by the sum of operators O5, O6 and O7, this disagrees with ref.[\cite=Cho], but agrees with Misiak[\cite=Mis]. The sought amplitude will be proportional to the squared modulus of

[formula]

instead of |C7(Mb)|2 itself.

Following ref.[\cite=Springer] [\cite=Mis], applying eqs.([\ref=C7]), one finds

[formula]

where g(mc / mb)≃0.45 and f(mc / mb)≃2.4 corresponding to the phase space factor and the one-loop QCD correction to the semileptonic decay, respectively[\cite=Cabi]. The electromagnetic fine structure constant evaluated at the b quark scale takes value as αQED(mb) = 1 / 132.7. The results are summarized in Fig.3 as functions of the top quark mass. The QCD-uncorrected values are also shown. In this figure, one can easily see that, at mt = 170GeV, it results in 13% enhancement from Misiak's result[\cite=Mis], and for mt = 250GeV, 16% is found.

As a conclusion, we have given the full leading log QCD corrections(include QCD runnings from mtop to MW), with whole anomalous dimension matrix untruncated. Comparison to the previous calculation[\cite=Cho], two points are improved:

(1) Correct errors of anomalous dimensions in ref.[\cite=Cho].

(2) Use untruncated anomalous dimensions in QCD running from MW to mb instead of truncated ones.

In fact, point(1) makes an enhancement while point(2) leads to a suppression. The total result does not change a lot, e.g. a suppression of 3% at mtop = 170GeV comparing ref.[\cite=Cho].

The whole QCD-enhancement of the [formula] makes a factor of 3.9 at mt = 170GeV, when ΛQCD = 175MeV. Using the experimental branching ratio [formula], one can find that [formula] at mt = 174GeV. It just reaches the upper limit of present experiment of CLEO. That shows there is very little space for new physics.
