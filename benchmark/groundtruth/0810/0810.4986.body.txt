Maximum Multiplicity of a Root of the Matching Polynomial of a Tree and Minimum Path Cover

K.B. Wong

Introduction

All the graphs in this paper are simple. The vertex set and the edge set of a graph G are denoted by V(G) and E(G) respectively. A matching of a graph G is a set of pairwise disjoint edges of G. Recall that for a graph G on n vertices, the matching polynomial μ(G,x) of G is given by

[formula]

where p(G,k) is the number of matchings with k edges in G. Let [formula] denote the multiplicity of θ as a root of μ(G,x).

The following results are well known. The proofs can be found in [\cite=G0].

The maximum multiplicity of a root of the matching polynomial μ(G,x) is at most the minimum number of vertex disjoint paths needed to cover the vertex set of G.

Consequently,

If G has a Hamiltonian path, then all roots of its matching polynomial are simple.

The above is the source of motivation for our work. It is natural to ask when does equality holds in Theorem [\ref=max-path]. In this note, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the maximum multiplicity of a root of the matching polynomial of a tree to be equal to the minimum number of vertex disjoint paths needed to cover it. Before stating the main result, we require some terminology and basic properties of matching polynomials.

It is well known that the roots of the matching polynomial are real. If u∈V(G), then [formula] is the graph obtained from G by deleting the vertex u and the edges of G incident to u. It is known that the roots of [formula] interlace those of G, that is, the multiplicity of a root changes by at most one upon deleting a vertex from G. We refer the reader to [\cite=G0] for an introduction to matching polynomials.

As a consequence of Lemma [\ref=interlacing], we can classify the vertices in a graph by assigning a 'sign' to each vertex (see [\cite=G]).

Let θ be a root of μ(G,x). For any vertex u∈V(G),

u is θ- essential if [formula],

u is θ- neutral if [formula],

u is θ- positive if [formula].

Clearly, if [formula] then there are no θ-essential vertices since the multiplicity of a root cannot be negative. Nevertheless, it still makes sense to talk about θ-neutral and θ-positive vertices when [formula]. The converse is also true, i.e. any graph G with [formula] must have at least one θ-essential vertex. This was proved in [\cite=G].

A further classification of vertices plays an important role in establishing some structural properties of a graph:

Let θ be a root of μ(G,x). For any vertex u∈V(G), u is θ- special if it is not θ-essential but has a neighbor that is θ-essential.

If G is connected and not all of its vertices are θ-essential, then G must contain a θ-special vertex. It turns out that a θ-special vertex must be θ-positive (see [\cite=G]).

We now introduce the following definition which is crucial in describing our main result.

Let G be a graph and [formula] be a set of vertex disjoint paths that cover G. Then Q is said to be (θ,G)- extremal if it satisfies the following:

θ is a root of μ(Qi,x) for all [formula];

for every edge e = {u,v}∈E(G) with u∈Qr and v∈Qs, r  ≠  s, either u is θ-special in Qr or v is θ-special in Qs.

Our main result is the following:

Let T be a graph and [formula] be a set of vertex disjoint paths covering T. Then m is the maximum multiplicity of a root of the matching polynomial μ(T,x), say [formula] for some root θ, if and only if Q is (θ,T)-extremal.

The following example shows that Theorem [\ref=main] cannot be extended to general graphs.

Consider the following graph G:

[formula]

Let P7 denote the path on 7 vertices. Note that [formula] and μ(P7,x)  =  x7 - 6x5 + 10x3 - 4x. By Theorem [\ref=max-path], the maximum multiplicity of a root of μ(G,x) is 2. Also, G can be covered by two paths on 7 vertices. However, [formula] is not a root of μ(P7,x).

Basic Properties

In this section, we collect some useful results proved in [\cite=G0] and [\cite=G]. Recall that if u∈V(G), then [formula] is the graph obtained from G by deleting vertex u and the edges of G incident to u. We also denote the graph [formula] by [formula]. Note that the resulting graph does not depend on the order of which the vertices are deleted.

If e∈E(G), the graph G - e is the graph obtained from G by deleting the edge e.

The matching polynomial satisfies the following basic identities, see [\cite=G0].

Let G and H be graphs, with matching polynomials μ(G,x) and μ(H,x), respectively. Then

[formula],

[formula] where e = {u,v} is an edge of G,

[formula] for any vertex u of G.

Suppose P is a path in G. Let [formula] denote the graph obtained from G by deleting the vertices of P and all the edges incident to these vertices. It is known that the multiplicity of a root decreases by at most one upon deleting a path, see [\cite=G].

If equality holds, we say that the path P is θ- essential in G. Godsil [\cite=G] proved that if a vertex v is not θ-essential in G, then no path with v as an end point is θ-essential. In other words,

The next result of Godsil [\cite=G] implies that a θ-special vertex must be θ-positive.

Gallai-Edmonds Decomposition

It turns out that θ-special vertices play an important role in the Gallai-Edmonds decomposition of a graph. We now define such a decomposition. For any root θ of μ(G,x), partition the vertex set V(G) as follows:

[formula]

We call these sets of vertices the θ- partition classes of G. The Gallai-Edmonds Structure Theorem is usually stated in terms of the structure of maximum matchings of a graph with respect to its θ-partition classes when θ = 0. Its proof essentially follows from the following assertions (for more information, see [\cite=LP]):

Let G be any graph and let D0(G), A0(G) and C0(G) be the 0-partition classes of G.

Let u∈A0(G) be a 0-special vertex in G. Then

[formula] v∈D0(G) if and only if [formula];

[formula] v∈A0(G) if and only if [formula];

[formula] v∈C0(G) if and only if [formula].

If every vertex of G is 0-essential then [formula].

For any root θ of μ(G,x), it was shown by Neumaier [\cite=N] that the analogue of Gallai's Lemma holds when G is a tree. A different proof was given by Godsil (see [\cite=G]).

Let T be a tree and let θ be a root of μ(T,x). If every vertex of T is θ-essential then [formula].

On the other hand, it was proved in [\cite=G] that if θ is any root of μ(T,x) where T is tree and [formula], then v∈Dθ(T) if and only if [formula]. It turns out that this assertion is incorrect (see Example [\ref=counter-example] below). However, using the idea of the proof of Theorem 5.3 in [\cite=G], we shall prove the Stability Lemma for trees with any given root of its matching poynomial. Note that the Stability Lemma is a weaker statement than Theorem 5.3 in [\cite=G]. Together with Theorem [\ref=Neu], this yields the Gallai-Edmonds Structure Theorem for trees with general root θ. Recently, Chen and Ku [\cite=KC] had proved the Gallai-Edmonds Structure Theorem for general graph with any root θ. However, our proof of the special case for trees, which uses an eigenvector argument, is different from the the one given in [\cite=KC]. We believe that different proofs can be illuminating. For the sake of completeness, we include the proof in the next section.

Let T be a tree and let θ be a root of μ(T,x). Let u∈Aθ(T) be a θ-special vertex in T. Then

[formula] v∈Dθ(T) if and only if [formula];

[formula] v∈Aθ(T) if and only if [formula];

[formula] v∈Cθ(T) if and only if [formula].

It is well known that the matching polynomial of a graph G is equal to the characteristic polynomial of G if and only if G is a forest. To prove Theorem [\ref=stability-tree], the following characterization of θ-essential vertices in a tree via eigenvectors is very useful. Recall that a vector [formula] is an eigenvector of a graph G with eigenvalue θ if and only if for every vertex u∈V(G),

[formula]

Let T be a tree and let θ be a root of its matching polynomial. Then a vertex u is θ-essential if and only if there is an eigenvector f of T such that [formula].

In fact Proposition [\ref=Neumaier] can be deduced from Lemma 5.1 of [\cite=G]. The following corollaries are immediate consequences of Proposition [\ref=Neumaier].

Let T be a tree and let θ be a root of its matching polynomial. Let [formula] be a nonzero real number. If f is an eigenvector of T such that [formula], then there exists another eigenvector g such that [formula]. Moreover, both g and f have the same support, i.e. [formula].

Let [formula] be the vector defined as follows: for any vertex x of T,

[formula]

Then, for any vertex x of T,

[formula]

So g is the required vector. Clearly, g(x) = 0 if and only if f(x) = 0, so g and f have the same support.

Let T be a tree. If u is θ-special then it is joined to at least two θ-essential vertices.

By definition, u has a θ-essential neighbor, say w. By Proposition [\ref=Neumaier], there exists an eigenvector f of T corresponding to θ such that [formula]. By Proposition [\ref=Neumaier] again, f(u) = 0 and so [formula]. This implies that [formula] on at least two neighbors of u. By Proposition [\ref=Neumaier], both of them are θ-essential.

The following assertion follows from Theorem [\ref=Neu] and Proposition [\ref=Neumaier].

Let T be a tree and let θ be a root of μ(T,x). Suppose every vertex of T is θ-essential. Then every θ-eigenvector of T has no zero entries.

We also require the following partial analogue of the Stability Lemma for general root obtained by Godsil in [\cite=G].

Let θ be a root of μ(G,x) with non-zero multiplicity k and let u be a θ-positive vertex in G. Then

if v is θ-essential in G then it is θ-essential in [formula];

if v is θ-positive in G then it is θ-essential or θ-positive in [formula];

if u is θ-neutral in G then it is θ-essential or θ-neutral in [formula].

Proof of the Stability Lemma for Tree

This section is devoted to the proof of Theorem [\ref=stability-tree], which will follow from the following theorem.

Let T be a tree and let θ be a root of μ(T,x). Then there exists a θ-eigenvector f of T such that [formula] for every θ-essential vertex x in T. Moreover, if v is θ-essential in [formula] where u is θ-special in T, then v is θ-essential in T.

If every vertex of T is θ-essential, then the result follows from Corollary [\ref=C3]. Therefore, we may assume that T has a θ-special vertex, say u. We proceed by induction on the number of vertices.

Suppose [formula] are all the neighbors of u in T. Then each bi belongs to different components of [formula], say bi∈V(Ci) where [formula] are components of [formula].

First, we partition the set [formula] as follows:

[formula]

By the inductive hypothesis, for each i∈A, there exists a θ-eigenvector fi of Ci such that [formula] for every θ-essential vertex x in Ci. In particular, [formula] for all i∈A. By Proposition [\ref=delete-positive], any θ-essential vertex in T is also θ-essential in [formula], so for each i∈A,

[formula]

For every i∈A, choose [formula] such that

[formula]

Such a choice is always possible since |A|  ≥  2 by Corollary [\ref=C2]. Now, applying Corollary [\ref=C1] to each fi with i∈A, we obtain the eigenvectors gi of Ci such that [formula] with both gi and fi having the same support. In particular, it follows from ([\ref=e2]) that for each i∈A,

[formula]

Also, for each i∈B, by the inductive hypothesis, we can choose an eigenvector gi so that [formula] for every θ-essential vertex x in Ci. By Proposition [\ref=delete-positive] again, ([\ref=e3]) also holds for every gi with i∈B. However, note in passing that gi(bi)  =  0 for all i∈B since bi is not θ-essential in Ci (by Proposition [\ref=Neumaier]).

Next, for each i∈C, set gi to be the zero vector on V(Ci). Note that ([\ref=e3]) is satisfied vacuously for every gi with i∈C since there are no θ-essential vertices in the corresponding Ci.

Finally, we extend these gi's to an eigenvector of T as follows: define [formula] by

[formula]

Since ([\ref=e3]) holds for every gi, we must have [formula] for every θ-essential vertex x of T. It is also readily verified that conditions in ([\ref=eigenvalue]) are satisfied so that g is indeed a θ-eigenvector of T, as desired.

Moreover, by our construction, if x is θ-essential in [formula], then [formula]. By Proposition [\ref=Neumaier], x must be θ-essential in T, proving the second assertion of the theorem

Proof of Theorem [\ref=stability-tree].

Recall that u is a given θ-special vertex of T. By Proposition [\ref=delete-positive], it remains to show that if v is θ-essential in [formula] then v is θ-essential in T. But this is just the second assertion of the preceding theorem. This proves the Stability Lemma for trees.

Let T be the following tree

[formula]

The vertices are labeled [formula] and the symbols *  , +  , -   below each vertex indicates whether it is θ-neutral or θ-positive or θ-essential respectively where θ = 1. Note that μ(T,x) = x9 - 8x7 + 20x5 - 18x3 + 5x and [formula]. As the vertex v5 is adjacent to a θ-essential vertex, v5 is θ-special in T. By Theorem [\ref=stability-tree], upon deleting v5 from T, all other vertices are 'stable' with respect to their θ-partition classes:

[formula]

However, this is generally not true if we delete a non-special vertex, for example, deleting v3 from T gives the following:

[formula]

Roots of Paths

In this section, we prove some basic properties about roots of paths.

Note that μ(P1,x) = x and μ(P2,x) = x2 - 1, and so they have no common root. Suppose μ(Pn,x) and μ(Pn - 1,x) have a common root for some n  ≥  3. Let n be the least positive integer for which μ(Pn,x) and μ(Pn - 1,x) have a common root, say θ. Then μ(Pn - 1,x) and μ(Pn - 2,x) have no common root.

First we show that [formula]. Note that for any graph G, the multiplicity of 0 as a root of its matching polynomial is the number of vertices missed by some maximum matching. Therefore, if n is even then Pn has a perfect matching, so 0 cannot be a root of μ(Pn,x). It follows that if n is odd then 0 cannot be a root of μ(Pn - 1,x). So [formula].

Let {v1,v2} be an edge in Pn where v1 is an endpoint of the path Pn. Note that [formula] and [formula]. By part (c) of Proposition [\ref=identity], μ(Pn,x)  =  xμ(Pn - 1,x)  -  μ(Pn - 2,x), so θ is a root of μ(Pn - 1,x) and μ(Pn - 2,x), which is a contradiction. Hence μ(Pn,x) and μ(Pn - 1,x) have no common root.

Let θ be a root of μ(Pn,x). Then the endpoints of Pn are θ-essential.

Suppose v is an endpoint of Pn. If v is θ-neutral or θ-positive in Pn then θ is a root of μ(Pn - 1,x), a contrary to Lemma [\ref=no-common].

Let θ be a root of μ(Pn,x). Then Pn has no θ-neutral vertices. Moreover, every θ-positive vertex in Pn is θ-special.

Let v be a vertex of Pn such that it is not θ-essential. In view of Lemma [\ref=neutral-essential], it is enough to show that v has a θ-essential neighbor. By Corollary [\ref=endpoints], v cannot be an endpoint of Pn. Then [formula] consists of two disjoint paths, say Q1 and Q2. Let u1 be the endpoint of Q1 such that it is a neighbor of v in Pn.

Consider the paths Q1 and Q1v in Pn. Since v is not θ-essential, by Lemma [\ref=essential-path], Q1v is not θ-essential in Pn. So the path [formula] has θ as a root of its matching polynomial.

If Q1 is not θ-essential in Pn then the path [formula] would also have θ as a root of its matching polynomial. Since [formula] and Q2 differ by exactly one vertex, this contradicts Lemma [\ref=no-common]. Therefore, Q1 is a θ-essential path in Pn. By Lemma [\ref=essential-path], u1 must be θ-essential in Pn. Since u1 is joined to v, we deduce from Lemma [\ref=neutral-essential] that v must be θ-special.

Proof of Main Result

We begin by proving the following special case.

Let T be a tree and [formula]. Let Q  =  {Q1,Q2} be a set of vertex disjoint paths that cover T. Then Q is (θ,T)-extremal.

Since T is a tree, there is an edge {u,v}∈E(T) with u∈V(Q1) and v∈V(Q2). By Lemma [\ref=interlacing-path], [formula]. Similarly, [formula]. Therefore θ is a root of μ(Q1,x) and μ(Q2,x).

It remains to show that either u is θ-special in Q1 or v is θ-special in Q2. If all vertices in T are θ-essential, then [formula] by Theorem [\ref=Neu], which is impossible. So, there must be a θ-special vertex in T, say w.

Suppose w = u. We shall prove that w is also θ-special in Q1. Note that [formula]. If w is an endpoint of Q1 then [formula] is a disjoint union of two paths [formula] and Q2. Since [formula] and Q2 cover [formula], we deduce from Theorem [\ref=max-path] that [formula], a contradiction. So w is not an endpoint of Q1. Removing w from Q1 would result in two disjoint paths, say R1 and R2. Note that [formula] is the disjoint union of R1, R2 and Q2. By part (a) of Proposition [\ref=identity], [formula]. By Theorem [\ref=path] and the fact that [formula], we conclude that [formula]. Therefore, [formula]. This means that w must be θ-positive in Q1. By Corollary [\ref=special], w is θ-special in Q1, as desired.

The case w = v can be proved similarly.

Therefore, we may assume that [formula]. We now proceed by induction on the number of vertices. Without loss of generality, we may assume that w∈V(Q1). As before, it can be shown that w is not an endpoint of Q1. So removing w from Q1 results in two disjoint paths, say S1 and S2. We may assume that u∈V(S2). Then [formula] is a disjoint union of S1 and T' where T' is the tree induced by S2 and Q2. By Theorem [\ref=path], [formula]. Since S2 and Q2 cover T', by Theorem [\ref=max-path], [formula]. As w is θ-special, [formula]. By part (a) of Proposition [\ref=identity], [formula]. We deduce that [formula] and [formula]. By induction, either u is θ-special in S2 or v is θ-special in Q2. In the latter, we are done. Therefore, we may assume that u is θ-special in S2. So u is not θ-essential in [formula]. Since [formula], w is θ-positive in Q1, so w is θ-special in Q1 by Corollary [\ref=special]. By the Stability Lemma for trees (Theorem [\ref=stability-tree]), u is not θ-essential in Q1. By Corollary [\ref=special], u is θ-special in Q1.

Note that the base cases of our induction occur when w = u or w = v.

Let T be a tree and [formula]. Suppose [formula] be a set of vertex disjoint paths that cover T. Then Q is (θ,T)-extremal.

We shall prove this by induction on m  ≥  1. The theorem is trivial if m = 1. If m = 2, then the result follows from Proposition [\ref=m=2]. So let   ≥  3. Since T is a tree, there exist two paths, say Q1 and Qm, such that exactly one vertex in Q1 is joined to other paths in Q and exactly one vertex in Qm is joined to other paths in Q. To be precise, let T' denote the tree induced by [formula]. Then there is only one edge joining Q1 to T' and only one edge joining Qm to T'.

By Theorem [\ref=path], [formula]. Let T'' be the tree induced by T' and Qm, that is [formula]. Now T'' can be covered by [formula]. By Theorem [\ref=max-path], [formula]. Therefore, [formula]. Moreover, m - 1 is the maximum multiplicity of a root of μ(T'',x). By induction, [formula] is [formula]-extremal.

By a similar argument, [formula] is [formula]-extremal. Hence Q is (θ,T)-extremal.

Let F be a forest and [formula] be a set of vertex disjoint paths that cover F. Suppose Q is (θ,F)-extremal. Then [formula] and θ is a root of μ(F,x) with the maximum multiplicity.

Since F can be covered by m vertex disjoint paths, by Theorem [\ref=max-path], we must have [formula] for any root α of μ(F,x). It remains to show that [formula].

An edge {u,v} of F is said to be Q- crossing if u and v belong to different paths in Q. If F contains no Q-crossing edges then F consists of m disjoint paths [formula]. Clearly, [formula], as required. So we may assume that there exists an edge {u,v}∈E(F) such that u∈V(Q1) and v∈V(Q2). Since Q is (θ,F)-extremal, either u is θ-special in Q1 or v is θ-special in Q2.

We now proceed by induction on the number of vertices. Suppose u is θ-special in Q1. Since u is not an endpoint of Q1, [formula] consists of two disjoint paths, say R1 and R2. Since [formula] and [formula] for each i = 1,2 (by Theorem [\ref=path]), we deduce that [formula] for each i = 1,2. Note that [formula] is a set of disjoint paths that cover [formula]. Recall that there are no θ-neutral vertices in Q1. Moreover, by the Stability Lemma for trees (Theorem [\ref=stability-tree]), every θ-positive vertex in Q1 remains θ-positive in [formula] and every θ-essential vertex in Q1 remains θ-essential in [formula]. So every θ-special vertex in Q1 remains θ-special in [formula]. Consequently, [formula] is [formula]-extremal. By induction, [formula] and θ is a root of [formula] with maximum multiplicity. It follows from Lemma [\ref=interlacing] that [formula], as desired.

The case when v is θ-special in Q2 can be settled by a similar argument. Note that the base cases of our induction occur when F has no crossing edges.

Our main result Theorem [\ref=main] now follows immediately from Theorem [\ref=main1] and Theorem [\ref=main2].
