Addendum to Maximal regularity and Hardy spaces

Proposition 3.14 in [\cite=ABZ] states as follows: Let H1, H2 be any Hardy spaces obtained via an atomic decomposition. Any linear operator mapping the atoms of H1 into a bounded set in H2 has a bounded extension from H1 into H2.

M. Bownik [\cite=B], based on an example of Y.Meyer in Meyer, Taibleson and Weiss [\cite=MTW], showed that the Hardy space norm and the finite Hardy space norm may not be equivalent on the finite Hardy space (defined by restricting atomic decompositions to be finite sums and the atoms are L∞-atoms in the sense of Coifman-Weiss). Hence, Proposition 3.14 is not correct as stated.

The paper by Meda, Sjögren and Vallarino [\cite=MSV] establishes, among other things, that if one replaces L∞ atoms by L2 atoms, the equivalence holds. Hence, for an operator to have a bounded extension it suffices it is bounded on L2-atoms. Moreover, the extension coincides with the original operator on [formula]. So Proposition 3.14 is correct if H1 is the original Coifman-Weiss Hardy space and atoms are L2-atoms. As the atoms in [\cite=ABZ] are L2-atoms on a space of homogeneous type, this applies directly to the spaces H1z(X) and (with little extra work) H1r(X) defined in [\cite=ABZ]: the maximal regularity operator and its adjoint have the boundedness property announced in Theorem 2.1 there.

Another possibility to reach our conclusion is to apply the weak-type (1,1) result of Coulhon and Duong [\cite=CD] under our hypotheses. This implies that the maximal regularity operator and its adjoint are defined on L1, thus on the Hardy space. Taking approximations of the these operators by truncating integrals in their definitions, one can adapt the proof of Lemma 1 in Chapter VI of Meyer's book [\cite=M].
