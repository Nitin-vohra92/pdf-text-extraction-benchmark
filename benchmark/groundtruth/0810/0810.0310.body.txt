Abstract

A graph G = (V,E) is representable if there exists a word W over the alphabet V such that letters x and y alternate in W if and only if (x,y)∈E for each x  ≠  y. If W is k-uniform (each letter of W occurs exactly k times in it) then G is called k-representable. It was shown in [\cite=KP] that a graph is representable if and only if it is k-representable for some k. Minimum k for which a representable graph G is k-representable is called its representation number.

In this paper we give a characterization of representable graphs in terms of orientations. Namely, we show that a graph is representable if and only if it admits an orientation into a so-called semi-transitive digraph. This allows us to prove a number of results about representable graphs, not the least that 3-colorable graphs are representable. We also prove that the representation number of a graph on n nodes is at most n, from which one concludes that the recognition problem for representable graphs is in NP. This bound is tight up to a constant factor, as we present a graph whose representation number is n / 2.

We also answer several questions posed in [\cite=KP], in particular, on representability of the Petersen graph and local permutation representability.

Introduction

A graph G = (V,E) is representable if there exists a word W over the alphabet V such that letters x and y alternate in W if and only if (x,y)∈E for each x  ≠  y. It is k-representable if each letter appears exactly k times. The notion of representable (directed) graphs was introduced in [\cite=KS] to obtain asymptotic bounds on the free spectrum of the widely-studied Perkins semigroup which has played central role in semigroup theory since 1960, particularly as a source of examples and counterexamples. In [\cite=KP], the only paper solely dedicated to the study of representable graphs, numerous properties of representable graphs are derived and numerous types of representable and non-representable graphs are pinpointed. Still, large gaps of knowledge of these graphs have remained, and the purpose of this paper is to address them.

We address the three most fundamental issues about representable graphs:

Are there alternative representations of these graphs that aid in reasoning about their properties?

Which types of graphs are representable and which ones are not? And,

How large words can be needed to represent representable graphs?

These can be viewed as some of the most basic questions of any graph class. We make progress on each of these.

We characterize representable graphs in terms of orientability. The edges can be directed so as to yield a directed graphs satisfying a property that we call semi-transitivity. It properly generalizes the transitivity property of comparability graphs, constraining the subgraphs induced by certain types of cycles. The definition and the characterization is given in Section 3. This formulation allows us to reason fairly easily about the types of graphs that are representable.

We show that the class of representable graphs captures quite involved properties. In particular, all 3-colorable graphs are representable. This resolves a conjecture of [\cite=KP] regarding the Petersen graph, showing that it is representable. We actually give an explicit construction to show that it is 3-representable. The result also properly captures all the previously known classes of representable graphs: outerplanar, prisms, and comparability graphs. On the negative side, we answer an open question of [\cite=KP] by presenting a non-representable graphs all of whose induced neighborhoods are comparability graphs.

Finally, we show that any representable graph is n-representable, again utilizing the semi-transitive orientability. Previously, no non-trivial upper bound was known on the representation number, which is the smallest value k such that the given graph is k-representable. This result implies that problem of deciding whether a given graph is representable is contained in NP. This bound on the representation number is tight up to a constant factor, as we construct graphs with representation number n / 2. We also show that deciding if a representable graph is k-representable is NP-complete for 3  ≤  k  ≤  ⌈n / 2⌉, while the class of circle graphs coincides with the class of graphs with representation number at most 2.

However, the first, and currently the only, paper solely dedicated to the study of representable graphs is [\cite=KP]. We review some of the results from that paper in Section [\ref=def]. The current paper provides substantial additions to the known results on representable graphs, in particular solving some of open problems in [\cite=KP].

If a word W is k-uniform (each letter of W occurs exactly k times in it) then G is called k-representable. It was shown in [\cite=KP] that a graph is representable if and only if it is k-representable for some k. However, nothing was known on an upper bound for the length of words representing graphs except for words that permutationally represent graphs (see Section [\ref=def] for definitions), namely that a permutationally representable graph on n nodes is ⌈n / 2⌉-representable (this follows from Lemma [\ref=l1] below proved in [\cite=KS], the fact that the dimension of a poset on n elements is at most n / 2, and an evident fact that a k-representable graph is also (k + 1)-representable). In this paper we prove that if a graph on n nodes is representable then it is n-representable, from which one concludes that the recognition problem for representable graphs is in NP. In Section [\ref=nice] we prove a fact that a comparability graph is permutationally (k - 1)-representable if and only if the poset induced by this graph has dimension k - 1. Thus it is NP-hard to determine if a graph is permutationally k-representable, and also whether it is k-representable for 3  ≤  k  ≤  ⌈n / 2⌉ that effectively kills the hope of giving any nice characterization of, say, the class of 3-representable graphs. On the other hand, permutationally 2-representable graphs are the permutation graphs, and 2-representable graphs are the circle graphs which generalizes a result in [\cite=KP] that each outerplanar graph is 2-representable (see Section [\ref=nice] and [\cite=C]). We leave as an open problem the decision problem "Is a given graph representable?".

It turns out that 3-colorable graphs are representable (see Section [\ref=char]) while 4-colorable graphs are not necessarily representable. In any case, it is possible to give a characterization of representable graphs in terms of orientations which we do in Section [\ref=char].

We give an example of k-representable but not (k - 1)-representable graph thus showing that there does not exist a constant c such that each representable graph is a-representable for a  ≤  c (see Section [\ref=nice]). As an example one can take the graph Gk obtained from a cocktail party graph Hk,k by adding an all-adjacent vertex.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section [\ref=def] we give definitions of objects of interest and review some of the known results. In Section [\ref=char] we give a characterization of representable graphs in terms of orientations and discuss some important corollaries of this fact. In Section [\ref=nice] we consider the problems concerning the representation numbers, and show that it is always at most n but can be as much as n / 2. We explore in Section [\ref=classif] which classes of graphs are representable, showing, in particular, 3-colorable graphs to be representable, but numerous others to be orthogonal to representability. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of algorithmic complexity and some open problems in Section [\ref=open].

Definitions, notation, and known results

In this section we follow [\cite=KP] to define the objects of interest.

Let W be a finite word over an alphabet [formula]. If W involves the letters [formula] then we write [formula]. Let X be a subset of Var(W). Then [formula] is the word obtained by eliminating all letters in X from W. A word is k-uniform if each letter appears in it exactly k times. A 1-uniform word is also called a permutation. Denote by W1W2 the concatenation of words W1 and W2. We say that the letters xi and xj alternate in W if the word induced by these two letters contains neither xixi nor xjxj as a factor. If a word W contains k copies of a letter x then we denote these k appearances of x by [formula]. We write xji < xlk if xji stays in W before xlk, i. e., xji is to the left of xlk in W.

Let G = (V,E) be a graph with the vertex set V and the edge set E. We say that a word W represents the graph G if there is a bijection φ:Var(W)  →  V such that (φ(xi),φ(xj))∈E if and only if xi and xj alternate in W. It is convenient to identify the vertices of a representable graph and the corresponding letters of a word representing it. We call a graph G representable if there exists a word W that represents G. If G can be represented by a k-uniform word, then we say that G is k-representable. Clearly, the complete graphs are the only examples of 1-representable graphs. So, in what follows we assume that k  ≥  2. Let the representation number of a graph G be the minimum k such that G is k-representable.

We call a graph permutationally representable if it can be represented by a word of the form [formula] where all Pi are permutations. In particular, all permutationally representable graphs are k-representable.

A digraph (directed graph) is transitive if the adjacency relation is transitive, i. e. for every vertices x,y,z∈V the existence of the arcs xy,yz∈E yields that xz∈E. A comparability graph is an undirected graph having an orientation of the edges that yields a transitive digraph.

The following results on representable graphs are known. They were proved in [\cite=KP] except for the Lemma [\ref=l1] that was proved in [\cite=KS].

Let W = AB be a k-uniform word representing a graph G. Then the word W' = BA also k-represents G.

Let the graphs G1 and G2 be k-representable and x∈V(G1),y∈V(G2). Assume that the graph G is obtained from G1 and G2 by identifying the vertices x and y into a new vertex z. Then G is also k-representable.

A graph is permutationally representable if and only if it is a comparability graph. In particular, all bipartite graphs are permutationally representable.

For a vertex x∈V(G) denote by N(x) the set of all its neighbors.

If G is representable, then for every x∈V(G) the graph induced by N(x) is permutationally representable.

Outerplanar graphs are 2-representable.

For every graph G there exists a 3-representable graph H that contains G as a minor. In particular, a 3-subdivision of every graph G is 3-representable.

All prisms are 3-representable. Moreover, the triangular prism has the representation number 3.

Theorem [\ref=t1] provides an easy way to construct non-representable graphs: just take a graph that is not a comparability graph and add an all-adjacent vertex to it. The wheel W5 is the smallest non-representable graph. Some other small non-representative graphs are given in Fig. 1 (this figure appears in [\cite=KP]).

Paper [\cite=KP] contains several open problems. In this paper we solve some of them.

Characterization of Representable Graphs by Orientability

The word representation of representable graphs is simple and natural. Yet it does not lend to easy arguments for the characteristic of representable graphs. Non-representability is even harder to argue in terms of the many possible corresponding words. The main result of this section is a new characterization of representable graphs that leads easily to various results about representability.

We give a characterization in terms of orientability, which implies that representability corresponds to a property of a digraph obtained by directing the edges in certain way. Recall that Lemma [\ref=l1] states that a graph is permutationally representable if and only if it has a transitive orientation. We prove a similar fact on representable graphs, namely, that a graph is representable if and only if it has a so-called semi-transitive orientation. Our definition, in fact, generalizes that of a transitive orientation.

Other orientations have been defined in order to capture generalizations of comparability graphs. As transitive orientations form constraints on the orderings of induced P3, these generalizations form constraints on the orderings of induced P4. These include perfectly orderable graphs (and its subclasses) and opposition graphs [\cite=classes]. Classes such as chordal graphs are defined in terms of vertex-orderings, and imply therefore indirectly acyclic orientations. None of these properties captures our definition below, nor does our characterization subsume any of them.

We turn to the characterization and start with definitions of certain directed graphs. A semi-cycle is the directed acyclic graph obtained by reversing the direction of one arc of a directed cycle. An acyclic digraph is a shortcut if it is induced by the vertices of a semi-cycle and contains a pair of non-adjacent vertices. Thus, a digraph on the vertex set [formula], is a shortcut if it contains a directed path [formula], the arc v0vt and it is missing the arcs vivj for 0  ≤  i  <  j  ≤  t (in particular, t  ≥  3).

A graph is semi-transitively orientable if there exists an orientation of the edges that results in a semi-transitive graph.

Our main result in this paper is the following.

A graph is representable if and only if it is semi-transitively orientable.

We first need some additional definitions and lemmas. A topological order (or topsort) of an acyclic digraph is a permutation of the vertices that obeys the arcs, i. e. for each arc uv, u precedes v in the permutation. For a node-labeled digraph, let it also refer to the word obtained by visiting the nodes in that order. Let D = (V,E) be a digraph. The t-string digraph Dt of D is defined as follows. The vertices of Dt are vi, for v∈V and [formula], and viuj is an arc in Dt if and only if either i = j and vu∈E or i  <  j and uv∈E. Intuitively, the t-string digraph of D has t copies of D strung together. Given a word S, let GS denote the graph represented by S. If S is a topsort of Dt then we also denote by GS the graph represented by the word S' obtained from S by omitting the superindices of the vertices (i. e. the copies of the same vertex in S are considered as the same letters in S').

Given a digraph D, let GD be the graph obtained by ignoring orientation.

We argue that the word representing a semi-transitive digraph comes from a special topological ordering of the t-string digraph Dt for some t. We first observe that any topological ordering of Dt preserves arcs.

Let D be a digraph with distinct node-labels. Let S be a topological ordering of a Dt. Then GD is a subgraph of GS.

Consider an edge uv in GD, and suppose without loss of generality that it is directed as uv in D. Then, in Dt, there is a directed path [formula]. Thus, occurrences of u and v in a topsort of Dt are alternating. Hence, uv∈GS.

To prove equivalence, we now give a method to produce a topological ordering that generates all non-arcs. We say that a subgraph H covers a set A of non-arcs if each non-arc in A is also found in H. A word covers the non-arcs if the graph it represents covers them.

The non-arcs incident with a path in a semi-transitive digraph can be covered with a 2-uniform word.

Let P be a path in a semi-transitive digraph D. We shall form a topsort S of the 2-string digraph D2 and show that it covers all non-arcs having at least one endpoint on P.

We say that a node x of D2 depends on node y if there is a directed path from y to x in D2, i. e. y must appear before x in a topological ordering of D2. We use the notation [formula] if x depends on y. A node is listed earliest possible if it is listed as soon as all nodes that it depends on have been listed. A node is listed latest possible if it is listed after all nodes that do not depend on it.

Let S be any topological ordering of D2 where the first occurrences of nodes in P are as late as possible and the second occurrences are as early as possible. The ordering of other nodes is arbitrary, within these constraints.

We claim that this word S covers all non-arcs involving nodes in P. Consider a pair u,v, where [formula] and u∈P. Note that v may also belong to P, in which case we may assume that the path goes from u to v. Consider the listings of u1,v1,u2,v2, where the subscript refers to the occurrence number of the node. Observe that u may depend on v, or vice versa, but not both. There are three cases to consider.

Case (i): There is a path from u to v in D. We claim that u2 does not depend on v1. Suppose it does, i. e. [formula]. Then, there is an arc x1y2∈D2 such that [formula] and [formula]. By the assumptions and the symmetry of the two copies of D in D2, it follows that [formula]. By the definition of 2-string graphs, yx is an arc in D, so y1x1∈E(D2). Then, by semi-transitivity, u1v1∈E(D2), or uv∈E(GD), which is a contradiction. It now follows that the nodes will occur as u1u2v1v2 in S, i. e. [formula].

Case (ii): There is a path from v to u in D. This is symmetric to case (i), with u replaced by v. Thus, the nodes will occur as v1v2u1u2 in S.

Case (iii): The nodes u and v are incomparable in D. In particular, v is not in P. Then, u1 and v1 do not depend on each other, nor do u2 and v2. If v2 depends on u1 then the nodes occur as v1u1u2v2 in S. Otherwise, their order is v1v2u1u2.

We now return to the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:rep-equals-semi-trans], starting with the forward direction. Given a word-representant S, we direct an edge from x to y if the first occurrence of x is before that of y in the word. Let us show that such orientation D of GS is semi-transitive. Indeed, assume that x0xt∈E(D) and there is a directed path [formula] in D. Then in the word S we have [formula] for every i. Since x0xt∈E(D) we have xit < xi + 10. But then for every j < k and i there must be xij < xik < xi + 1j, i. e. xixj∈E(D). So, D is semi-transitive.

For the other direction, denote by G the graph and by D its semi-transitive orientation. Let [formula] be the set of directed paths covering all vertices of D. For every [formula] denote by Si the topsort of the digraph D2 satisfying the conditions of Lemma [\ref=lem:path-to-2rep] for the path Pi. Put [formula]. Clearly, S is a 2τ-uniform word; it can be treated as a topsort of a 2τ-string D2τ. Then G = GS. Indeed, by Lemma [\ref=lem-top-preserves] we have E(G)  ⊂  E(GS). On the other hand, if [formula] then u∈Pi for some i, and thus by Lemma [\ref=lem:path-to-2rep] the letters u and v are not alternating in the subword Si. Therefore, [formula]. Theorem [\ref=thm:rep-equals-semi-trans] is proved. [formula]

Theorem [\ref=thm:rep-equals-semi-trans] makes clear the relationship to comparability graphs, which are those that have transitive orientations. Since transitive digraphs are also semi-transitive, this immediately implies that comparability graphs are representable.

The Representation Number of Graphs

We focus now on the following question: Given a representable graph, how large is its representation number? In [\cite=KP], certain classes of graphs were proved to be 2- or 3-representable, and an example was given of a graph (the triangular prism) with the representation number of 3. On the other hand, no examples were known of graphs with representation numbers larger than 3, nor were there any non-trivial upper bounds known. We show here that the maximum representation number of representable graphs is linear in the number of vertices.

For the upper bound, we use the results of the preceding section. We have the following directly from the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:rep-equals-semi-trans].

A representative graph G is 2τ(G)-representable, where τ(G) is the minimum number of paths covering all nodes in some semi-transitive orientation of G.

This immediately gives an upper bound of 2n on the representation number. We can improve this somewhat with an effective procedure.

Given a semi-transitive digraph D on n vertices, there is a polynomial time algorithm that generates an n-uniform word representing GD. Thus, each representable graph is n-representable.

The algorithm works as follows.

Step 0. Start with [formula] and i = 1.

Step i. If D contains a path Pi covering at least two vertices from [formula] then let [formula] and i: = i + 1. Otherwise, let [formula] and go to the Final Step.

Final Step. Let Si be the topsort of the digraph D2 satisfying the conditions of Lemma [\ref=lem:path-to-2rep] for the path Pi and put [formula] where t is the number of paths found at previous steps. If |B|  ≤  1 then let S = S'. Otherwise, consider a topsort S0 of D where the vertices of B are listed in a row (since the vertices of B do not depend on each other, such a topsort must exist) and in particular in the reverse order of their appearance in S1. Let S  =  S'S0.

Clearly, GD = GS (the proof is the same as in Theorem [\ref=thm:rep-equals-semi-trans]). It is easy to verify that each letter appears in S at most n times.

Theorem [\ref=thm:di-to-string] implies that the graph representability is polynomially verifiable, answering an open question in [\cite=KP]. Indeed, having a representable graph G, we may ask for a word W k-representing it and verify this fact in time bounded by the polynomial on k and n. Since k  ≤  n, this is a polynomial on n. So, we have proved

The recognition problem for representable graphs is in NP.

We now show that there are graphs with representation number of n / 2, matching the upper bound within a factor of 2.

The cocktail party graph Hk,k is the graph obtained from the complete bipartite graph Kk,k by removing a perfect matching. Denote by Gk the graph obtained from a cocktail party graph Hk,k by adding an all-adjacent vertex.

The graph Gk has representation number k = ⌊n / 2⌋.

The proof is based on three statements.

Let H be a graph and G be the graph obtained from H by adding an all-adjacent vertex. Then G is k-representable if and only if H is permutationally k-representable.

Let 0 be the letter corresponding to the all-adjacent vertex. Then every other letter of the word W representing G must appear exactly once between two consecutive zeroes. We may assume also that W starts with 0. Then the word [formula] is a permutational k-representation of H. Conversely, if W' is a word permutationally k-representing H, then we insert 0 in front of each permutation to get a k-representation (in fact permutational) of G.

Recall that the dimension of a poset is the minimum number of linear orders such that their intersection induces this poset.

A comparability graph is permutationally k-representable if and only if the poset induced by this graph has dimension at most k.

Let H be a comparability graph and W be a word permutationally k-representing it. Each permutation in W can be considered as a linear order where a < b if a meets before b in the permutation (and vice versa). We want to show that the comparability graph of the poset induced by the intersection of these linear orders coincides with H.

Two vertices a and b are adjacent in H if and only if their letters alternate in the word. So, they must be in the same order in each permutation, i. e. either a < b in every linear order or b < a in every linear order. But this means that a and b are comparable in the poset induced by the intersection of the linear orders, i. e. a and b are adjacent in its comparability graph.

The next statement most probably is known but we give its proof here for the sake of completeness.

The poset P over 2k elements [formula] such that ai < bj for every i  ≠  j and all other elements are not comparable has dimension k.

Assume that this poset is the intersection of t linear orders. Since ai and bi are not comparable for each i, their must be a linear order where bi < ai. If we have in some linear order both bi < ai and bj < aj for i  ≠  j, then either ai < aj or aj < ai in it. In the first case we have that bi < aj, in the second that bj < ai. But each of these inequalities contradicts the definition of the poset. Therefore, t  ≥  k.

In order to show that t = k we can consider a linear order [formula] together with all linear orders obtained from this order by the simultaneous exchange of ak and bk with am and bm respectively ([formula]). It can be verified that the intersection of these k linear orders coincides with our poset.

Now we can prove Theorem [\ref=example]. Since the cocktail party graph Hk,k is a comparability graph of the poset P, we deduce from Lemmas [\ref=cocktail] and [\ref=obs:dimension] that Hk,k is permutationally k-representable but not permutationally (k - 1)-representable. Then by Lemma [\ref=obs:rep-permrep] we have that Gk is k-representable but not (k - 1)-representable. Theorem [\ref=example] is proved.

The above arguments help us also in deciding the complexity of determinining the representation number. From Lemmas [\ref=obs:rep-permrep] and [\ref=obs:dimension], we see that it is as hard as determining the dimension k of a poset. Yannakakis [\cite=Yann] showed that the latter is NP-hard, for any 3  ≤  k  ≤  ⌈n / 2⌉. We therefore obtain the following.

Deciding whether a given graph is k-representable, for any given 3  ≤  k  ≤  ⌈n / 2⌉, is NP-complete.

It was further shown by Hegde and Jain [\cite=HJ] that it is NP-hard to approximate the dimension of a poset within almost a square root factor. We therefore obtain the following hardness for the representation number.

Approximating the representation number within n1 / 2 - ε-factor is NP-hard, for any ε  >  0.

In contrast with these hardness results, the case k = 2 turns out to be easier and admits a succinct characterization. The following fact essentially appears in [\cite=C]. Recall that a graph is called a circle graph if we can arrange its vertices as chords on a circle in such a way that two nodes in the graph are adjacent if and only if the corresponding chords overlap.

Indeed, given a circle graph G, consider the ends of the chords on a circle as a letters and read the obtained word in a clockwise order starting from an arbitrary point. It is easy to see that two chords intersect if and only if the corresponding letters alternate in the word. For the opposite direction, place 2n nodes at a circle in the same order as they meet in the word and connect the same letters by chords.

It follows from Theorems [\ref=2repr] and [\ref=t2] that outerplanar graphs are circle graphs. Theorem [\ref=2repr] can also be useful as a tool in proving that a graph is not a circle graph. For example, non-representable graphs (for instance, all odd wheels W2t + 1 for t  ≥  2) are not circle graphs.

Characteristics of Representable Graphs

When faced with a new graph class, the most basic questions involve the kind of properties it satisfies: which known classes are properly contained (and which not), which graphs are otherwise contained (and which not), what operations preserve representability (or non-representability), and which properties hold for these graphs.

Previously, it was known that the class of representable graphs includes comparability graphs, outerplanar graphs, subdivision graphs, and prisms. The purpose of this section is to clarify this situation significantly, including resolving some conjectures. We start with exploring the impact of colorability on representability.

Chromatic number and representability

3-colorable graphs are semi-transitive, and thus representable.

Given a 3-coloring of a graph, direct its edges from the first color class through the second to the third class. It is easy to see that we obtain a semi-transitive digraph.

This implies a number of earlier results on representability, including that of outerplanar graphs, subdivision graphs, and prisms (see Theorems [\ref=t2], [\ref=t3] and Proposition [\ref=pr4]). The theorem also shows that 2-degenerate are representable, as well as graphs of maximum degree 3 (via Brooks theorem).

This result does not extend to higher chromatic numbers. The examples in Fig. [\ref=small] show that 4-colorable graphs can be non-representable. We can, however, obtain a results in terms of the girth of the graph, which is the length of its shortest cycle.

Let G be a graph whose girth is greater than its chromatic number. Then, G is representable.

Suppose the graph is colored with χ(G) natural numbers. Orient the edges of the graph from small to large colors. There is no directed path with more than χ(G) - 1 arcs, but since G contains no cycle of χ(G) or fewer arcs, there can be no shortcut. Hence, the digraph is semi-transitive.

Theorem [\ref=obs:3col] also implies that the Petersen graph is representable, turning down a conjecture in  [\cite=KP]. We can show that the graph is actually 3-representable. We give here two of its 3-representations, related to the numbering in Fig. [\ref=petersen], that were found in [\cite=KL]:

1, 3, 8, 7, 2, 9, 6, 10, 7, 4, 9, 3, 5, 4, 1, 2, 8, 3, 10, 7, 6, 8, 5, 10, 1, 9, 4, 5, 6, 2

1, 3, 4, 10, 5, 8, 6, 7, 9, 10, 2, 7, 3, 4, 1, 2, 8, 3, 5, 10, 6, 8, 1, 9, 7, 2, 6, 4, 9, 5

The following argument shows that Petersen's graph is not 2-representable. Suppose that the graph is 2-representable and W is a word 2-representing it. Let x be a letter in W such that there are minimum number of letters between the two appearances of x. Clearly, there are exactly three different letters between them. By symmetry, we can assume that x = 1 and by Proposition [\ref=pr1] we can assume that W starts with 1. So, letters 2,5, and 6 are between the two 1's and because of symmetry, the fact that Petersen's graph is edge-transitive (that is, each of its edges can be made "internal"), and taking into account that nodes 2, 5, and 6 are pairwise not adjacent, we can assume that W = 12561W16W25W32W4 where Wi's are some factors for i = 1,2,3,4. To alternate with 6 but not to alternate with 5, we must have 8∈W1 and 8∈W2. Also, to alternate with 2 but not to alternate with 5, we must have 3∈W3 and 3∈W4. But then 8833 is a subsequence in W and thus 8 and 3 are not adjacent in the graph, a contradiction.

We explore now further graph properties that are orthogonal to representability.

Non-representable graphs

One of the open problems posed in [\cite=KP] was the following.

Are there any non-representable graphs that do not satisfy the conditions of Theorem [\ref=t1]?

We give here the positive answer. A counterexample to the converse of Theorem [\ref=t1] is given by the graph in Fig. [\ref=co-T2] called co-(T2) in [\cite=LINK]. It is easy to check that the induced neighborhood of any node of the graph co-(T2) is a comparability graph.

The graph co-(T2) is non-representable.

Assume that the graph in Fig. [\ref=co-T2] is k-representable for some k and W is a word-representant for it. The vertices 1,2,3,4 form a clique; so, their appearances 1i,2i,3i,4i in W must be in the same order for each [formula]. By symmetry and Proposition [\ref=pr1] we may assume that the order is 1234. Now let I1, [formula] be the set of all

[formula]

Note that the existence of edges between vertices 5,6,7 was not used in the proof of Theorem [\ref=anti-t1]. So, we actually have four counter-examples to the converse of Theorem [\ref=t1].

What about other non-representable graphs? Or, rather, which important classes of graphs are not contained in the class of representable graphs? We establish the following classes to be not necessarily representable:

chordal (see the rightmost graph in Fig. [\ref=small]), and thus perfect,

line (second graph in Fig. [\ref=small]),

co-trees (the graph co-T2 earlier), and thus co-bipartite and co-comparability,

2-outerplanar (the first and last graphs in Fig. [\ref=small]), and thus planar,

split (the last graph in Fig. [\ref=small]),

3-trees (the last graph in Fig. [\ref=small]), and thus partial 3-trees.

On the other hand, the 4-clique, K4, is representable and it belongs to all these classes.

The effect of graph operations

One may want to explore which operations on graphs preserve representability (or non-representability). We pinpoint one such operation, and list others that are orthogonal.

The following operation on a representable graph yields a representable graph: Replace any node with a comparability graph, connecting all the new nodes to the neighbors of the original node. I. e., replacing a node with a module that is a comparability graph.

A generalization of Proposition [\ref=pr1a] on identifying cliques of size more than 1 from two representable graphs is false. Indeed, consider the rightmost graph in Fig. [\ref=small] without a node of degree 2 connected to the end points of edge e (denote this graph by G), and identify e with an edge in a triangle T resulting in obtaining the rightmost graph in Fig. [\ref=small]. Both G and T are representable, but gluing them through an edge (a clique of size 2) results in a non-representable graph.

The complement to a non-representable graph can be permutationally representable: see, for example, the second graph in Fig. [\ref=small].

Not much can be said in general on the taking line graph operation. For example, the second non-representable graph in Fig. [\ref=small] is obtained from K2,3 together with an edge between the nodes of degree 3, which is representable. On the other hand, there are many easy constructible examples when representable graphs go to representable graphs by taking line graph operation.

Concluding Remarks and Open Questions

It is natural to ask about optimization problems on representable graphs. Theorem [\ref=obs:3col] implies that many classical optimization problems are NP-hard on representable graphs:

Note that it may be relevant whether the representation of the graph as a semi-transitive digraph is given; solvability under these conditions is open.

However, some problems remain polynomially solvable:

Indeed, we can simply use the fact that the neighborhood of any node is a comparability graph. The clique problem is easily solvable on comparability graphs. Thus, it suffices to search for the largest clique within all induced neighborhoods.

There are still many questions one can ask on representable graphs, some of which are stated below.

Is it NP-hard to decide whether a graph is representable?

What is a tighter upper bound on the representation number of a graph, in terms of n? We know that it lies between n / 2 and n.

Can one characterize the forbidden subgraphs of representative graphs? This problem seems to be hard since even for 2-representable (i. e. circle) graphs such a characterization is unknown.
