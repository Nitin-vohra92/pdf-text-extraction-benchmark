A model-independent test for scale-dependent non-Gaussianities in the cosmic microwave background

Inflationary models of the very early universe have proved to be in very good agreement with the observations of the linear correlations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). While the simplest, single field, slow-roll inflation [\cite=Guth81] [\cite=Linde82] [\cite=Albrecht82] predicts that the temperature fluctuations of the CMB correspond to a (nearly) Gaussian, homogeneous and isotropic random field, more complex models may give rise to non-Gaussianity [\cite=Linde97] [\cite=Peebles97] [\cite=Bernardeau02] [\cite=Acquaviva03]. Models in which the Lagrangian is a general function of the inflaton and powers of its first derivative [\cite=Armendariz99] [\cite=Garriga99] can lead to scale-dependent non-Gaussianities, if the sound speed varies during inflation. Similarily, string theory models that give rise to large non-Gaussianity have a natural scale dependence [\cite=Loverde08a]. If the scale dependence of non-Gaussian signatures plays an important role in theory, the conventional (global) parametrisation of non-Gaussianity via fNL is no longer sufficient to describe the level of non-Gaussianity and to discriminate between different models. fNL must at least become scale dependent - if this parametrisation is sufficient at all. But first of all such scale-dependent signatures have to be identified. Possible deviations from Gaussianity have been investigated in studies based on e.g. the WMAP data of the CMB (see [\cite=Komatsu09a] and references therein) and claims for the detection of non-Gaussianities and other anomalies (see e.g. [\cite=Park04a] [\cite=Eriksen04a] [\cite=Hansen04] [\cite=Eriksen05] [\cite=Eriksen07] [\cite=deoliveiracosta04] [\cite=Raeth07] [\cite=Mcewen08a] [\cite=Copi08a]) have been made. These studies have in common that the level of non-Gaussianity is assessed by comparing the results for the measured data with a set of simulated CMB-maps which were generated on the basis of the standard cosmological model and/or specific assumptions about the nature of the non-Gaussianities. On the other hand, it is possible to develop model-independent tests for higher order correlations (HOCs) by applying the ideas of constrained randomisation [\cite=Pompilio95a] [\cite=Raeth02] [\cite=Raeth03], which have been developed in the field of nonlinear time series analysis [\cite=Theiler92]. The basic formalism is to compute statistics sensitive to HOCs for the original data set and for an ensemble of surrogate data sets, which mimic the linear properties of the original data. If the computed measure for the original data is significantly different from the values obtained for the set of surrogates, one can infer that the data contain HOCs. Based on these ideas we present in this Letter a new method for generating surrogates allowing for probing scale-dependent non-Gaussianities. Our study is based on the WMAP data of the CMB. Since our method in its present form requires full sky coverage to ensure the orthogonality of the set of basis functions Ylm we used the five-year "foreground-cleaned" Internal Linear Combination (ILC) map (WMAP5) [\cite=Gold09a] generated and provided by the WMAP-team. For comparison we also included the maps produced by Tegmark et al. [\cite=Tegmark03] [\cite=Deoliveiracosta06], namely the three year cleaned map (TOHc3) and the Wiener-filtered cleaned map (TOHw3), which were generated pursuing a different approach for foreground cleaning. Since the Gaussianity of the temperature distribution and the randomness of the set of Fourier phases are a necessary prerequisite for the application of our method we performed the following preprocessing steps. First, the maps were remapped onto a Gaussian distribution in a rank-ordered way. By applying this remapping we automatically focus on HOCs induced by the spatial correlations in the data while excluding any effects coming from deviations of the temperature distribution from a Gaussian one. To ensure the randomness of the set of Fourier phases we performed a rank-ordered remapping of the phases onto a set of uniformly distributed ones followed by an inverse Fourier transformation. These two preprocessing steps result in minimal changes to the ILC map (the maps remain highly correlated with cross-correlations c  >  0.95). The main effect is the removal of significant outliers in the temperature distribution. To test for scale-dependent non-Gaussianities in a model-independent way we propose the following two-step procedure. Without loss of generality we restrict the description of the method and all subsequent analyses to the case of non-Gaussianities on large scales. Consider a CMB map T(θ,φ), where T(θ,φ) is Gaussian distributed and calculate its Fourier transform. The complex valued Fourier coefficients alm, [formula] can be written as alm  =  |alm|eiφlm with [formula]. The linear or Gaussian properties of the underlying random field are contained in the absolute values |alm|, whereas all HOCs - if present - are encoded in the phases φlm and the correlations among them. First, we generate a first order surrogate map, in which any phase correlations for the scales, which are not of interest (here: the small scales), are randomised. This is achieved by a random shuffle of the phases φlm for l  >  lcut,0  <  m  ≤  l, where lcut = 10,15,20,25,30 in this Letter and by performing an inverse Fourier transformation (Fig. [\ref=figure1]). Second, N (N = 500 for lcut = 20, N = 100 otherwise) realisations of second order surrogate maps are generated for the first order surrogate map, in which the remaining phases φlm with 1  <  l  ≤  lcut,0  <  m  ≤  l are shuffled while the already randomised phases for the small scales are preserved. Fig. [\ref=figure1] shows a realisation of a second order surrogate map after inverse Fourier transformation. Note that the Gaussian properties of the remapped ILC map, which are given by |alm|, are exacly preserved in all surrogate maps. Finally, for calculating higher order statistics the maps were degraded to Nside = 256 and residual monopole and dipole contributions were subtracted. To compare the two classes of surrogates, we calculate local statistics in the spatial domain, namely scaling indices (SIM) as described in Räth et al. [\cite=Raeth07]. In brief, scaling indices estimate local scaling properties of a point set P. The spherical CMB data can be represented as a three-dimensional point distribution [formula] by transforming the temperature fluctuations into a radial jitter. For each point [formula] the local weighted cumulative point distribution ρ is calculated [formula]. The weighted scaling indices [formula] are then obtained by calculating the logarithmic derivative of [formula] with respect to r, [formula]. For each pixel we calculated scaling indices for ten different scales, r1 = 0.025,,r10 = 0.25 in the notation of [\cite=Raeth07]. For each scale we calculate the mean (〈α〉) and standard deviation (σα) of the scaling indices [formula] derived from a set of pixels belonging to rotated hemispheres or the full sky. To investigate the correlations between the scaling indices and temperature fluctuations, we also considered the standard deviation (σT) for the mere temperature distribution of the respective sky regions. The differences of the two classes of surrogates are quantified by the σ-normalised deviation S(Y) = (Ysurro1  -  〈Ysurro2〉) / σYsurro2, Y = σT,〈α〉,σα,χ2 (surro1: first order surrogate, surro2: second order surrogate) and the significance levels SL  =  1  -  p, where p is the fraction of second order surrogates, which have a higher (lower) Y than the first order surrogate. χ2 denotes diagonal χ2-statistics, which we obtain by combining 〈α〉,σα for a given scale ri, i.e. [formula] with X1  =  〈α〉,X2  =  σα and 〈Xj〉,σXj derived from the N realisations of second order surrogates. As scale-independent measure we also consider χ2 as obtained by summing over the scales (Nr = 10), [formula] for one single measure (j1 = 1,j2 = 1; j1 = 2,j2 = 2) and the two measures (j1 = 1,j2 = 2). Fig. [\ref=figure2] shows S(σT) and S(〈α(r10)〉) derived from pixels belonging to the respective upper hemispheres for 768 rotated reference frames. Statistically significant signatures for non-Gaussianity and ecliptic hemispherical asymmetries become immediately obvious, whereby these signatures can solely be induced by large scale HOCs. Although S(σT) and S(〈α(r10)〉) are spatially highly (anti-)correlated (c =  - 0.95), the two effects are nevertheless complementary to each other in the sense that a systematically lower/higher σT would lead to a lower/higher 〈α(r10)〉 and not to the observed higher/lower value for the first order surrogate map. These systematically shifted scaling indices are a generic feature present in all three maps (Fig. [\ref=figure3]). Although the probability densities P(α(r10)) are different due to the smoothing or Wiener-filtering for the three maps, the shifts of the first order surrogate relative to its second order surrogates can be found in all three cases. We also cross-correlated the deviation maps shown in Fig. [\ref=figure2] derived from the three input maps and always obtained c  ≥  0.98 for the correlation coefficient. These systematic deviations lead to significant detections of non-Gaussianities which are shown in Fig. [\ref=figure4] and summarised for lcut = 20 in Tables [\ref=table1]-[\ref=table2]. The most significant and most stable results are found for 〈α〉 at larger radii, where for all three maps none of the 500 second order surrogates had a higher (upper hemisphere) or lower (lower hemisphere) value than the respective first order surrogate, leading to a significance level SL  >  99.8 % for 〈α(r10)〉. Also the combined measure χ2〈α〉 yields deviations S ranging from 5.2 up to 7.9, which represent one of the most significant detection of non-Gaussianity in the WMAP data to date. We estimated how varying lcut values affect the results and found that both the non-Gaussianities and asymmetries are detected for all considered lcut, where the highest deviations are obtained for lcut  =  20. Although S becomes considerably smaller for lcut  =  10, we can still detect the non-Gaussianities with SL  >  99.0 %, which is larger than the results reported in [\cite=Chiang07] (SL  =  95 %), where also lcut  =  10 was used. We perfomed the same analyses for the coadded WMAP foreground template maps and for simulations using the best fit ΛCDM power spectrum and WMAP-like noise and beam properties. We found in none of these cases significant signatures as reported above. Details about these studies are deferred to a longer forthcoming publication. In conclusion, we demonstrated the feasibility to generate new classes of surrogate data sets preserving the power spectrum and partly the information contained in the Fourier phases, while all other HOCs are randomised. We found significant evidence for both asymmetries and non-Gaussianities on large scales in the WMAP data of the CMB using scaling indices as test statistics. The novel statistical test involving new classes of surrogates allows for an unambigous relation of the signatures identified in real space with scale-dependent HOCs, which are encoded in the respective Fourier phase correlations. Our results, which are consistent with previous findings [\cite=Park04a] [\cite=Eriksen04a] [\cite=Hansen04] [\cite=Eriksen05] [\cite=Eriksen07] [\cite=Chiang07] [\cite=Raeth07] but also extend to smaller scales than those reported in [\cite=deoliveiracosta04] (lcut  =  3) , [\cite=Chiang07] (lcut  =  10) and [\cite=Copi08a] (lcut  ≤  3), point towards a violation of statistical isotropy and Gaussianity. Such features would disfavour canonical single-field slow-roll inflation - unless there is some undiscovered systematic error in the collection or reduction of the CMB data or yet unknown foreground contributions. Thus, at this stage it is too early to claim the detected HOCs as cosmological and further tests are required to elucidate the true origin of the detected anomalies. Their existence in the three maps might, however, be suggestive. In either case the proposed statistical method offers an efficient tool to develop model-independent tests for scale-dependent non-Gaussianities. Due to the generality of this technique it can be applied to any signal, for which the analysis of scale-dependent HOCs is of interest.
