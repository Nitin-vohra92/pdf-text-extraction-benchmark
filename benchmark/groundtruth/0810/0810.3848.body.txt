Ejection of hypervelocity binary stars by a black hole of intermediate mass orbiting Sgr A*

Introduction

Hypervelocity stars (HVSs) are a natural consequence of the presence of a massive black hole (MBH) in the Galactic Center (GC). At present several HVSs are known to travel in the halo of the Milky Way (MW) with Galactic rest-frame velocities between + 400 and + 750    km  s -  1 (Brown et al. 2005, 2006, 2007). Only the tidal disruption of a tight stellar binary by a single MBH in Sgr A* or the scattering of a single star by a hypothetical MBH binary (MBHB) can kick a 3-4 [formula] star to such extreme velocities (e.g. Hills 1988; Yu & Tremaine 2003, hereafter Y03). Direct observational evidence for a secondary intermediate-mass hole (IMBH) closely orbiting Sgr A* is difficult to establish, however. In Sesana et al.  (2007) we showed that the observed velocity distribution of HVSs appears to marginally disfavor the MBHB ejection mechanism, though the statistics is still rather poor. Lu et al.  (2007, hereafter L07) showed that tight binary stars can be ejected by a MBHB without being tidally torn apart: the discovery of just one hypervelocity binary star (HVB) in forthcoming deep stellar surveys could then provide evidence of the existence of a massive or intermediate-mass black hole companion to Sgr A*.

The analysis of L07 is the starting point of this Letter. Our goal is to provide an estimate of the number of HVBs expected to be produced by the in-spiral of an IMBH onto Sgr A*, using the results of scattering experiments between a MBHB and a bound stellar cusp discussed in Sesana et al.  (2008, hereafter S08). We will show that a short burst of HVSs accompanied by a few HVBs would be an incontrovertible signature of a recent in-spiral. By contrast, depending on the properties of the population of binary stars in the GC, it is possible that a fast binary black hole in-spiral and coalescence may occur without the ejection of a single HVB in the Galactic halo.

MBHB-star interactions

Consider a star of mass m* orbiting the primary hole M1, and assume, for simplicity, that the secondary hole M2 (m*  ≪  M2  ≪  M1) is in a circular orbit of radius a around M1. When the star experiences a close encounter with M2, its velocity is of order the MBHB circular velocity, v*  ~  Vc = (GM1 / a)1 / 2. A star having closest approach distance to M2 equal to rmin,2  ≪  a will be subject to a velocity variation Δv*  ~  (GM2 / rmin,2)1 / 2 as a result of a (specific) force ~  GM2 / r2min,2 applied for an encounter timescale ~  (r3min,2 / GM2)1 / 2 (Quinlan 1996; Y03). This leads to

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula]. Since in the limit of close energetic encounters the ejection velocity of the star is, to first order, [formula], equation ([\ref=deltav]) shows two important scalings: (1), vej is inversely proportional to the square root of the closest approach distance to M2 during the interaction; and (2), the closest approach distance required to eject a star above a given speed (in units of Vc) scales with the MBHB mass ratio q. To verify these simple analytical estimates, we have performed 15 sets of 3-body scattering experiments, using the setup described in S08, for mass ratios q = 1 / 81,1 / 243,1 / 729, and eccentricities e = 0,0.1,0.3,0.6,0.9. In each set we integrated 5,000 orbits drawn from an isotropic distribution of stars bound to M1, and recorded vej, rmin,2, and rmin,1 (the closest approach distance to M1). The stellar semi-major axis a* is randomly sampled from fifty logarithmic bins spanning the range 0.03a < a*  <  10a. The stellar specific angular momentum L* is sampled in the interval

Hypervelocity stellar binaries

To quantify the fraction of binary stars that are not disrupted by M2 (and M1), we need to specify their mass and semi-major distributions. In our default model, we assume a log-flat distribution of semi-major axis,

[formula]

in the range 10- 2 < ab < 1 AU (Heacox 1998). The lower limit is set by the contact separation of two solar-mass stars, while the upper limit considers that binaries with ab > 1AU are unlikely to survive the dense stellar environment of the GC (e.g. Y03). We have also run a case with the distribution of semi-major axis arising from a log-normal distribution of binary periods Pb:

[formula]

Here C = 0.18 is a normalization constant, 〈 logPb〉 = 4.8, σ2 logPb = 2.3, and the period Pb is measured in days (Duquennoy & Major 1991). The above semi-major axis distributions are coupled to two different choices of the stellar binary member's mass function (for a total of 4 different models). We either assume all binaries to be composed by two equal solar-mass stars ([formula], default model), or to follow a Salpeter initial mass function (IMF) in the range [formula] for m* ,1 while m* ,2 is randomly chosen in the mass range [formula]. We shall discuss later the effect of these different assumptions on our results.

To estimate the fraction of stellar binaries that survive the interaction with the binary black hole and are ejected intact as HVBs, we proceed as follows. For fixed q and e, we consider orbital separations in the range 0.1 - 1  a0, select from our 5,000 simulated orbits those resulting in an ejection with vej > vesc, and denote their number with Nej(a). We then assume that each of these "ejection orbits" is followed by a binary stellar system with parameters ([formula] drawn from the distributions described above, and calculate the radii rT,2 and rT,1 using equation ([\ref=rtd]). Finally, if during the chaotic interaction with the MBH pair it is rmin,2 < rT,2 or rmin,1 < rT,1, the stellar binary is counted as "disrupted before ejection", and added to NTD(a). The fraction of HVBs as a function of a is then

[formula]

Results are shown in Figure [\ref=fig2] for our default model with MBHB eccentricity e = 0.6. The fraction of undisrupted HVBs is of order 20 - 40%, dropping to 5 - 20% if the distribution of of semi-major axis is derived from equation [\ref=pnorm], similar fractions are obtained for all the eccentricity values we sampled. Surviving hypervelocity binaries have [formula] AU, i.e. only tight binary stars can be ejected undisrupted. It is clear from the figure that fHVB and 〈ab〉 do not significantly change as the MBHB shrinks. We can understand this result by noting that [formula], i.e. [formula]. The ejection velocity (in physical units) does not depend then on MBHB separation, but only on the minimum approach distance to M2. Figure [\ref=fig2] also shows that the quantities fHVB and 〈ab〉 decrease slightly with decreasing black hole mass ratios q. This occurs because [formula], while [formula], i.e. the more massive the secondary hole the weaker the interaction required to kick a star above a given speed. If q is (say) three times smaller, a binary star must approach M2 at a distance three times smaller to be ejected. But as the breakup radius rT,2 decreases by just a factor 31 / 3, fewer tighter stellar binaries can survive undisrupted the tidal field of M2.

Ejection rates and detectability

We can now estimate the rate at which binary stars would be ejected into the MW halo by an IMBH spiralling into Sgr A*. In S08, we self-consistently computed the orbital evolution of such an IMBH in terms of a(t) and e(t) (see figure 8 in S08), and estimated the stellar mass ejection rate dmej / dt. Here, we assume that a fraction fb of scattered stars are binaries, and account for the evolving MBHB eccentricity during orbital decay by linearly interpolating the fraction fHVB(a,e) along the correct e(a) curve. The ejection rate of HVBs can be written as

[formula]

where 〈m*〉 is the mean stellar mass. Results are shown in Figure [\ref=fig3] for our default model and fb = 0.1. The HVB ejection rate peaks between 5  ×  10- 7 - 2  ×  10- 5 yr- 1 over a timescale of 106 - 107 yr, depending on q. For comparison, we also plot the ejection rate of HVSs by the in-spiralling IMBH (S08), as well as the rate of HVSs produced by the tidal disruption of a tight stellar binary by a single MBH in Sgr A* (Hills' mechanism), as estimated by Y03. In all the cases studied, the total number of HVBs, NHVB is small compared to the expected number of HVSs. We find NHVB = 28,9,4 for q = 1 / 81,1 / 243,1 / 729, respectively. If the ab distribution is log-normal (equation [\ref=pnorm]), the fraction of tight binaries is reduced and the number of HVBs drops by about a factor of 2. Moreover, in the case of a Salpeter IMF, [formula] and RHVB is further reduced by the same factor (see eq.  [\ref=rate]). The number of HVBs would trivially increase linearly with fb. The number of ejected hypervelocity binaries is well approximated by

[formula]

where fb, < 1 is the fraction of stars in binaries with ab < 1 AU, and 280 (170) is the normalization constant appropriate for a log-flat (log-normal) ab distribution.

It should be noted that our approach does not account for the binary stars that are not initially bound to the MBHB and populate its loss cone because of two-body relaxation processes. L07 estimated an HVB ejection rate for such unbound population of few×  10- 6 yr- 1 in the case of a MBHB with q = 0.01 and a = 0.0005 pc. Such a pair is expected to have a large eccentricity (e.g. Matsubayashi et al. 2007) and a coalescence timescale of only ~  105 yr. For larger orbital separations, the loss cone is larger but the mean ejection velocity is accordingly smaller, leading to lower ejection rates. Such rates are one dex smaller than those we derived for bound stars and q = 1 / 81.

Summary

We have applied the hybrid approach described in S08 to compute the rate of ejection and the total number of hypervelocity binary stars produced by a hypothetical IMBH orbiting Sgr A*. Depending on the mass of M2 and on the properties of binary stars in the central parsec of the Milky Way, we have shown that the number of undisrupted HVBs expelled before coalescence ranges from zero to a few dozens at most. In particular, we have found that the rapid in-spiral of a [formula] IMBH would generate ~  40 HVBs, assuming a stellar binary fraction of 0.1, [formula], and a log-flat distribution of stellar semi-major axis ab. A 10% binary stellar fraction with ab  <  few AU is suggested by numerical simulations of dense stellar clusters (e.g Shara & Hurley 2006, Portegies-Zwart, McMillan & Makino 2007). The number of HVBs is proportional to the mass of the IMBH and inversely proportional to m*, so in the case of a top-heavy stellar mass function (Schodel et al. 2007), the expected number of HVBs would be lower. Moreover, if the distribution of stellar binary semi-major axis is log-normal instead of log-flat, the number of tight binaries that can survive a strong interaction with the MBH pair is smaller. The combination of these factors can potentially decrease the number of expected HVBs to zero.

To conclude, while the observation of even a single HVB in the Galactic halo would be a decisive proof of the recent in-spiralling of an IMBH into Sgr A*, it is likely that such an event would give origin to at most a handful of HVBs. Therefore, the non-detection of stellar binaries in a complete survey of hypervelocity stars may not be used to rule out the existence of an IMBH-Sgr A* pair in the GC.
