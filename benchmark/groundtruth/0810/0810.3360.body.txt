Lifting to cluster-tilting objects in higher cluster categories

Introduction

Let k be an algebraically closed field and H be a finite-dimensional hereditary algebra. The associated cluster category CH was introduced and studied in [\cite=BMRRT], and also in [\cite=CCS] for algebras H of Dynkin type An. The cluster category CH is the orbit category Db(H) / τ- 1S, where S denotes the suspension functor and τ is the Auslander-Reiten translation in the bounded derived category Db(H). This is a certain 2-Calabi-Yau triangulated category which was invented in order to model some ingredients in the definition of cluster algebras introduced and studied by Fomin-Zelevinsky and Berenstein-Fomin-Zelevinsky in a series of articles [\cite=FZ1] [\cite=FZ2] [\cite=BFZ] [\cite=FZ3]. For this purpose, a tilting theory was developed in the cluster category. This further led to the theory of cluster-tilted algebras initiated in [\cite=BMR].

For a positive integer d > 1, a certain d + 1-Calabi-Yau category, the d-cluster category Cd = Db(H) / τ- 1Sd was considered by Keller in [\cite=Kel]. This category is showed in [\cite=Tho] that it encodes the combinatorics of the d-clusters of Fomin and Reading [\cite=FR] in a fashion similar to the way the cluster category encodes the combinatorics of the clusters of Fomin and Zelevinsky. For this reason, as a generalization of cluster categories, the d-cluster category and their (cluster-)tilting objects have been studied in [\cite=BT] [\cite=IY] [\cite=KR1] [\cite=Tho] [\cite=W] [\cite=Zhu] [\cite=ZZ] and so on.

It is an interesting problem to know the algebras derived equivalent to the cluster-tilted algebras. The study of their tilting modules is a step in this direction. In [\cite=S], a tilting module over a cluster-tilted algebra has been proved to lift to a cluster-tilting object in the cluster category. And in [\cite=FL], the authors prove that this result holds generally in the 2-Calabi-Yau triangulated category, that is, a tilting module over the endomorphism algebra of a cluster-tilting object in a 2-Calabi-Yau triangulated category lifts to a cluster-tilting object in this 2-Calabi-Yau triangulated category. The aim of current note is to get similar result of identifying tilting modules over cluster-tilted algebras corresponding to the higher cluster category by using the d + 1-Calabi-Yau property. Namely, we prove the following.

We point out here that the methods used in this note are different from the ones used in the case of 2-Calabi-Yau category (where d = 1). Some descriptions on the relation between cluster and classical tilting are given in [\cite=HJ].

Preliminaries

We recall some notations and known results.

Tilting modules

Let k be an algebraically closed field and A be a finite-dimensional algebra. Let [formula] be the category of finite-dimensional right A-modules. For an A-module T, let [formula] denote the full subcategory of [formula] with objects all direct summands of direct sums of copies of T. Then T is called a tilting module in [formula] if

[formula],

[formula],

there is an exact sequence 0  →  A  →  T0  →  T1  →  0, with T0,T1 in [formula].

This is the original definition of tilting modules from [\cite=HR], and it was proved in [\cite=B] that the third axiom can be replaced by the following:

the number of indecomposable direct summands of T (up to isomorphism) is the same as the number of simple A-modules.

d-Calabi-Yau categories and higher cluster categories

Let k be an algebraically closed field and C be a Krull-Schmidt triangulated k-linear category with split idempotents and suspension functor S. We suppose that all [formula]-spaces of C are finite-dimensional and that C admits a Serre functor Σ, cf.[\cite=RV]. Let [formula] be an integer. When we say that C is Calabi-Yau of CY-dimension i (or simply i-Calabi-Yau), we mean that there is an isomorphism of triangle functors

[formula]

For X,Y∈C and [formula], we put as usual

[formula]

Let H be a hereditary algebra and the number of simple H-modules be n . Let D = Db(H) be the bounded derived category of H with suspension functor S and the Auslander-Reiten translate τ. For a positive integer d > 1, the higher cluster category, d-cluster category is the orbit category Cd  =  D  /  τ- 1Sd. It is shown in [\cite=Kel] that Cd is a triangulated category and the canonical functor D  →  C is a triangle functor. We denote therefore by S the suspension in Cd. The d-cluster category is also Krull-Schmidt and is Calabi-Yau of CY-dimension d + 1. That is, for any X,Y in Cd,

[formula]

or equivalently

[formula]

We recall the notation of d-cluster-tilting object from [\cite=KR1] [\cite=Tho] [\cite=Zhu] [\cite=IY]. This notation shares the same meaning as "maximal d-orthogonal subcategory" in the sense of Iyama [\cite=I]. Let C be a d + 1-Calabi-Yau category. An object X in C is called rigid if

[formula]

A rigid object T is called d-cluster-tilting if it satisfies the property: if X∈Cd satisfies [formula] for all [formula] then [formula].

Let C be a d + 1-Calabi-Yau category with a d-cluster-tilting object T. Let Γ be the endomorphism algebra of T. For classes U,V of objects, we denote by U  *  V the full subcategory of all objects X of C appearing in a triangle

[formula]

Let [formula] be the functor which sends X to [formula]. There is an essential result in [\cite=KR1] as following.

For each module [formula], there is a triangle

[formula]

such that FX is isomorphic to M. The functor F induces an equivalence

[formula]

Thus when we say that a Γ-module L lifts to the higher cluster category, we mean its preimage under the equivalence.

We need the following theorem which is shown in [\cite=Zhu].

Let X be a rigid object in the d-cluster category Cd, then X is a d-cluster-tilting object if and only if X has n indecomposable summands, up to isomorphism.

Proof of the main result

First we prove the following crucial proposition.

Let C be a d + 1-Calabi-Yau category with a d-cluster-tilting object T and let Γ be the endomorphism algebra of T. Let M,N be two objects in T * ST and [formula] be their images under the functor F. If FM and FN are of projective dimension at most one and satisfy [formula] and [formula] then [formula] and [formula] for all 0 < i < d + 1.

We only need to show that the result holds for M,N indecomposable. Since FM is of projective dimension at most 1, we have the following exact sequence

[formula]

As the assumption, [formula]. By the definition of [formula] we have the following commutative diagram in [formula].

[formula]

Using the equivalence [formula] and because [formula], we have the following in C.

[formula]

That is, for any f:TM1  →  N, there exists g:TM0  →  N such that f factors through g.

First, we claim that

[formula]

In fact, consider the following two triangles

[formula]

and

[formula]

Let α be any morphism from M to SN. Since T is a d-cluster-tilting object in C, the composation

[formula]

Therefore there exists a morphism from TM0 to STN0 which makes the following diagram of triangles commutative.

[formula]

Thus we get

[formula]

for the reason that [formula]. So there exist β:STM1  →  SN such that α factors through β. As described above, we get γ:STM0  →  SN such that

[formula]

That is, we have the following commutative diagram

[formula]

where

[formula]

This implies [formula] Dually one can prove that [formula]

Now let 1 < i < d. As before, suppose that α:M  →  SiN. Here we consider the following two triangles

[formula]

and

[formula]

Again because T is a d-cluster-tilting object and [formula], we have

[formula]

Thus there exists morphism from TM0 to SiTN0, which is zero for the same reason that T is a d-cluster-tilting object, makes the diagram commutative.

[formula]

That is α  ·  pM0 = 0, so there exists β:STM1  →  SiN such that α factors through β. Note that

[formula]

which is zero since T is a d-cluster-tilting object and i > 1. So there exists γ:STM1  →  SiTN0 such that β factors through γ. But

[formula]

for the reason that T is a d-cluster tilting object and i > 1. This is to say that γ is zero, further more β is zero and so is α.

[formula]

Thus [formula].

When i = d, thanks to the d + 1-CY property, we have

[formula]

Dually one can prove [formula] for all 0 < i < d + 1.

Now our main result is an easy corollary.

The tilting Γ-module L lifts to a rigid object in Cd by the proposition above. Note that the number of indecomposable direct summands of L (up to isomorphism) is the same as the number of simple Γ-modules or equivalently the number of indecomposable summands of T, which is n by Theorem [\ref=Zhu]. Thus L lifts to a d-cluster-tilting object by Theorem [\ref=Zhu] again.
