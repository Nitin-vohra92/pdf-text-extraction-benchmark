Falling Jets of Particles in Viscous Fluids

Discussion

Experiments on gravity-driven suspension jets were performed by letting a dilute suspension of spheres (Ï†  ~  1% to 10%) settle by gravity out of a tube into a tank containing the same viscous liquid as that used to prepare the suspension. The density of the particles and the liquid viscosity were chosen so as to make the Reynolds number low (Re  ~  10- 3). Simulations of such jets were also performed in the Stokes flow regime using a point-particle approximation.

This fluid dynamics shows a typical experiment together with the corresponding simulation. Good qualitative agreement is observed between experiment and simulation, and both exhibit an instability by which an initially straight jet develops varicose modulations of its diameter. These modulations are reminiscent of the classical Rayleigh-Plateau instability of immiscible jets; in the present case, however, neither inertia nor surface tension play a role, and the precise mechanism of the instability in low-Re suspensions remains unknown.
