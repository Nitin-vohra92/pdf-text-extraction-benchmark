Linear Relations Among Poincaré Series

Introduction and Statement of Results

The classical Poincaré series at '∞  ', P(m,k,N;z), are defined by

[formula]

for [formula], [formula] with k  ≥  2 and [formula] such that 4|N when [formula]. Here e(z): = e2πiz, j(γ,z) is defined in ([\ref=eqn:j]) and [formula]. When m = 0, P(0,k,N;z) is a classical Eisenstein series. For m  ≥  1, P(m,k,N;z)∈Sk(N), where Sk(N) denotes the space of cusp forms of weight k for Γ0(N).

It is well known that the collection {P(m,k,N;z)}m  ≥  1 spans the space Sk(N). Beyond this, little is known about such Poincaré series. For example, since the space Sk(N) is finite dimensional, there exist many relations among the Poincaré series. Indeed, in his well known text, Iwaniec [\cite=iwaniec] states the following seemingly simple problem.

Problem. Find all the linear relations between P(m,k,N;z).

Iwaniec states this problem for more general multiplier systems. For simplicity we deal only with these classical multipliers, but the techniques here work with more general multipliers.

When seeking the solution to Iwaniec's problem it is not clear what the structure of such relations should be. It turns out this problem is related to the question of whether there are weakly holomorphic modular forms with a given principal part. A weakly holomorphic modular form is any meromorphic modular form whose poles are supported at the cusps.

One of the most famous examples of such a function is the j-invariant with Fourier expansion

[formula]

where q: = e(z). It is well known that all weakly holomorphic modular forms of weight 0 for [formula] are polynomials in j. As a result, any weakly holomorphic modular form of weight 0 for [formula] is determined by the coefficients of the negative powers of q in its Fourier expansion. This remains true for any non-positive weight and group Γ0(N).

More precisely, the principal part at infinity of a weakly holomorphic modular form f is the polynomial [formula] such that f(z) - Pf(z)  =  O(1) as y  →    ∞  . The principal part at other cusps is defined similarly.

Our definition of principal part is slightly non-standard. It is perhaps more typical to define the principal part with the condition f(z)  -  Pf(z)  =  O(e-  εy) as y  →    ∞   for some ε > 0. The difference in definition amounts to whether or not the constant coefficient is included in the principal part.

It is well known that a weakly holomorphic modular form of non-positive weight is uniquely determined by the collection of its principal parts at all cusps.

It is very natural to ask whether a given principal part corresponds to a weakly holomorphic modular form. This question has been studied in the context of Eichler cohomology. See [\cite=knopp] for more on this perspective. The approach taken here is from the perspective of harmonic weak Maass forms. Consequently, we explicitly describe all of the linear relations between the classical cuspidal Poincaré series in terms of obstructions to the existence of a weakly holomorphic form with zero principal part at cusps other than ∞  .

Let [formula] with k  ≥  2, [formula] and I be a finite set of positive integers. Then

[formula]

if and only if there exists a weakly holomorphic modular form of level N and weight 2 - k with principal part at ∞   equal to

[formula]

and the principal part at all other cusps is equal to 0.

In practice, it is not difficult to implement Theorem [\ref=thm:relation]. To illustrate this result, we now completely describe the situation for modular forms of even integer weights for [formula]. This situation is completely describable since we can write down all possible principle parts in a simple way. Let Es be the usual normalized Eisenstein series of weight [formula] and Δ be the normalized Hecke eigenform of weight 12. Additionally, set E0: = 1. All weakly holomorphic modular forms of weight 2 - k for [formula] are of the form

[formula]

for some [formula], s∈{0,4,6,8,10,14}, and [formula] with s  -  12r  =  2 - k. In the special case of F(j(z))  =  1 one immediately obtains the following corollary.

For k a positive even integer set dk: =  dim (Sk(1)). Then

[formula]

where s = 14 - k + 12dk and τ(r,s;n) is defined by

[formula]

i) We state Theorem [\ref=thm:relation] in terms of relations between the Poincaré series at '∞  '. To handle more general combinations one needs to take a linear combination of weakly holomorphic modular forms with principal part specified at each cusp.

ii) Using Theorem [\ref=thm:relation] together with the valence formula one may deduce that [formula] for [formula].

iii) From the proof of this theorem one may easily deduce exact formulas for the Fourier coefficients of non-positive weight modular forms with principal part equal to zero at all cusps other than ∞  . Such results were obtained earlier, in varying levels of generality, by Rademacher, Zuckerman, and others (see [\cite=rz] [\cite=z]).

iv) By Theorem [\ref=thm:relation] and the paragraph preceding Corollary [\ref=cor:relation] it is clear that [formula] if and only if there exists a polynomial [formula] with degree m - dk - 1 such that [formula] has principal part equal to q- m. Since the polynomial has m - dk degrees of freedom to match the m coefficients of the principal part we are naturally lead to the conjecture that P(m,k,1;z) should be vanishing only when dk = 0.

These results come as a natural consequence of the theory of harmonic weak Maass forms and the interplay between harmonic weak Maass forms and classical modular forms. This theory has been shown to have striking applications to many areas of mathematics, including partitions [\cite=BOPNAS], mock theta functions [\cite=bo1] [\cite=bo2] [\cite=BringOR], vanishing of Hecke eigenvalues [\cite=BOR], to name a few. For more about such applications and for the history of this program see [\cite=ono]. Here it turns out that there are nice duality theorems between nonholomorphic Maass-Poincaré series and holomorphic Poincaré series which imply the results above.

This paper is structured as follows. In Section [\ref=sec:Background] we will recall essential facts about harmonic weak Maass forms. This includes a discussion of Petersson inner products, a certain differential operator, and explicit Fourier expansions of two families of Poincaré series. In Section [\ref=sec:Proofs] we prove Theorem [\ref=thm:relation].

Background

Harmonic weak Maass forms

Here we give facts about harmonic weak Maass forms. Throughout, let [formula], with [formula]. Also, throughout suppose that [formula]. We define the weight k hyperbolic Laplacian by

[formula]

For odd integers d, define εd by

[formula]

A harmonic weak Maass form of weight k on

[formula]

of Nebentypus χ is any smooth function [formula] satisfying:

[formula]

for all [formula];

Δkf = 0;

There is a polynomial [formula] such that f(z) - Gf(z)  =  O(e-  εy) as y  →    ∞   for some ε > 0. Analogous conditions are required at all cusps.

We refer to Gf as the principal part of the harmonic weak Maass form f.

The differential operator plays a central role in the study of such forms. See [\cite=BF] for example. It is a fact that

[formula]

Here Hw(N) denotes the space of weight w harmonic weak Maass forms on Γ0(N). It is not difficult to make this more precise using Fourier expansions. In particular, every weight 2 - k harmonic weak Maass form f(z) has a Fourier expansion of the form

[formula]

where Γ(a,x) is the incomplete Gamma-function and q: = e2πiz. A straightforward calculation, see [\cite=BOPNAS], shows that ξ2 - k(f) has the Fourier expansion

[formula]

From this it is easy to see that ker (ξ2 - k)  =  M!2 - k(N).

As ([\ref=eqn:MaassFourier]) suggests, f(z) naturally decomposes into two summands

[formula]

We call f+ the "holomorphic part" and f- the "non-holomorphic part" of the harmonic weak Maass form f.

Finally, we define a pairing between the spaces Mk(N), the space of holomorphic modular forms of weight k for Γ0(N), and H2 - k(N). For g∈Mk(N) and f∈H2 - k(N) we define

[formula]

By Proposition 3.5 of [\cite=BF] the pairing of g and f can be explicitly evaluated in terms of the Fourier coefficients of g and the principal part of f. Additionally, Theorem 1.1 of [\cite=BF] gives that the pairing between Sk(N) and H2 - k(N) / M!2 - k(N) is non-degenerate, where M!2 - k(N)  ⊂  H2 - k(N) is the space of weakly holomorphic modular forms of weight 2 - k for Γ0(N). The following is a straightforward consequence of Proposition 3.5 of [\cite=BF].

Let [formula] and k  ≥  2 and f∈H2 - k(N). If f has the property that its principal part at each cusp is trivial, then [formula].

Maass-Poincaré Series

In this section we will describe two families of Poincaré series. As usual, for [formula] and functions [formula], we let

[formula]

where

[formula]

Let m be an integer, and let [formula] be a function which satisfies φm(y) = O(yα), as y  →  0, for some [formula]. With e(α): = e2πiα, let

[formula]

Such functions are fixed by the translations [formula].

Given this data, for integers N  ≥  1, we define the generic Poincaré series

[formula]

In this notation the classical family is given by

[formula]

We define a second family of Poincaré series, the Maass-Poincaré series of Hejhal (see [\cite=Hejhal]). Let Mν,  μ(z) be the usual M-Whittaker function. For complex s, let

[formula]

and for m  ≥  1 let [formula]. We let

[formula]

The Fourier expansions of these series are given in terms of the I-Bessel and J-Bessel functions, and the Kloosterman sums

[formula]

Here v runs through the primitive residue classes modulo c, and [formula] We have the following proposition (for example, see [\cite=BOPNAS] [\cite=Hejhal]).

If k  ≥  2 with [formula] and m,N  ≥  1, then Q( - m,k,N;z)∈H2 - k(N), and has a Fourier expansion of the form

[formula]

where and where for negative integers n we have and where and where for positive integers n we have Additionally, the principal part at all other cusps is constant.

More common is the Fourier expansion for the classical Poincaré series. It is given in the following proposition. See [\cite=iwaniec] for a proof.

If [formula], k  ≥  2, and m,N  ≥  1 with 4|N when [formula], then [formula], where

Using Propositions [\ref=prop:QqExp] and [\ref=prop:poincClassical] with ([\ref=eqn:xiFourier]) and the identity

[formula]

we see that

[formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:relation]

In this section we use the interplay between the non-holomorphic part and holomorphic part of a harmonic weak Maass form to prove Theorem [\ref=thm:relation].

Assume that [formula]. Write

[formula]

We have

[formula]

By our assumption on the sum over the Poincaré series we know that c-f(n) = 0 for all n < 0. But then f∈M!2 - k(N). So we see that

[formula]

is the weakly holomorphic form that we desire.

Conversely, assume that such a weakly holomorphic modular form exists. Call it f. From the expansion for the coefficients of Q+( - m,k,N;z) in Proposition [\ref=prop:QqExp] we may conclude that [formula] and has principal part at each cusp equal to 0. By Lemma [\ref=lem:nondegenerate], [formula]
