Structure prediction based on ab initio simulated annealing for boron nitride

Introduction

The knowledge of the crystal structure of a solid compound is one of the basic questions in solid state theory[\cite=Maddox88] [\cite=Cohen89] [\cite=Catlow90] [\cite=Schoen96b] [\cite=Jansen02b]. Since the early 1990's, an effort has been made to develop methods to predict structures of solids without any experimental information about the structure. The starting point is the realization that any (meta)stable modification of a (solid) compound corresponds to a locally ergodic region on the energy landscape of the chemical system. For low temperatures, such regions are centered on local minima of the energy that are surrounded by sufficiently high energy barriers. Since both the thermodynamically stable and the multitude of kinetically stable modifications are of interest, the global search is not restricted to the determination of the global minimum, but also includes local minima [\cite=Schoen96b].

The most common methods used for the structure prediction of solids are simulated annealing [\cite=Kirk83] [\cite=Czerny85] [\cite=Pannetier90], genetic algorithms [\cite=Holland75] [\cite=Johnston04] [\cite=Oganov06] [\cite=Woodley07], basin hopping [\cite=Nayeem1991] [\cite=Wales1997], or the recently introduced metadynamics [\cite=Laio2002].

Structure prediction usually involves a huge amount of CPU time, and therefore efficient ways to keep the calculations tractable have to be found. Thus, the procedures were initially split in two steps: first, a global search on the potential surface was performed. The energy was evaluated with empirical potentials, e.g. Coulomb and Lennard-Jones potentials, or chemically/physically motivated cost functions. After the global search, e.g. using simulated annealing, possible structure candidates were locally optimized on the ab initio level, usually with density functional theory.

Empirical potentials are very efficient, but also have various drawbacks: they work reasonably well for ionic systems, but less for covalent systems; and some knowledge of the expected bond type is required in advance to choose the potential. Recently [\cite=DollPCCP], we demonstrated that a full ab initio treatment is feasible in both stages, i.e. the global search and the subsequent local optimization can both be performed on the ab initio level. The system considered (lithium fluoride) was chosen for several reasons: the small number of electrons leads to fast calculations, and the ionicity of the system makes convergence easy. Moreover, the system had earlier been studied with model potentials [\cite=Schoen95] [\cite=Cancarevic08], and it turned out that the relevant minima were the same when full ab initio structure prediction was performed [\cite=DollPCCP] (for a brief summary see also [\cite=Dollfuerpisani]).

In the present work, boron nitride (BN) was chosen as an example for a covalent system. This is a significant extension of the previous work, since a covalent system is much more difficult to study: covalent bonds between the atoms have to be formed, and convergence for random structures is much more difficult in this case. At zero pressure, BN has a hexagonal structure, with space group 194, see e.g. [\cite=Pease1952]. Under pressure, it may transform to a zincblende [\cite=Wentorf1957] or a wurtzite structure [\cite=Bundy1963], and a corresponding phase diagram was obtained [\cite=CorriganBundy1975]. There is, however, an ongoing discussion concerning the correct phase diagram, see e.g. [\cite=Mujica2003]. Also, a rhombohedral structure was found (a layered structure similar to the hexagonal structure) [\cite=Ishii1981], and turbostratic boron nitride with a random arrangement of the layers has been reported [\cite=Thomas1963]. These structures are summarized in table [\ref=expstructures]. For overviews, see also [\cite=MSF] [\cite=StructureBonding102]. Early ab-initio calculations were performed from the mid 1980's onwards, e.g. [\cite=Wentzcovitch1986] [\cite=Park1987] [\cite=Catellani1987] [\cite=Orlando1990] [\cite=Xu1993] [\cite=Christensen1994] [\cite=Furthmueller1994] [\cite=Albe1997] [\cite=Kern1999].

The present task is for several reasons far from straightforward: first, the CPU time has to be reduced by a large factor. As we showed for the system LiF [\cite=DollPCCP], simply performing simulated annealing with standard ab initio calculations would lead to CPU times of the order of 2 years for a single run, and often hundreds of such runs need to be performed. Therefore, very subtle methods have to be employed to reduce the CPU time for the ab initio calculations, without losing too much accuracy. In our earlier study of LiF, very careful tests were required in order to reduce the CPU time to a few days. Similarly, many tests have to be performed to reduce the required CPU time in the case of BN to reasonable values. Secondly, one needs a strategy to converge the system in all steps of the global exploration: at the beginning of the search, the unit cell has a very large volume, and the atoms are at random positions within the cell, i.e. the configuration is like in a gaseous state. The total energy calculation at such a geometry has to be converged, and it has to be converged for all the subsequent steps of the simulated annealing procedure. This has to be done in an automatic way, since thousands of calculations at successive geometries are performed. Finally, it is a very interesting and important question whether this procedure will find all the very different structure types: the layered structures, and the three-dimensional structures such as wurtzite and zincblende.

Method

The general method consists of several steps: first, a simulated annealing run with a subsequent stochastic quench is performed, to identify possible candidate structures. This is followed by a local optimization based on analytical gradients. Finally, the symmetry and space group are identified. This is repeated many times, in order to identify as large as possible a set of structure candidates, and to obtain some statistics about the structures found.

The details for the BN calculations are described in the following paragraphs. 4 boron and 4 nitrogen atoms were placed at random positions in a large unit cell which was initially cubic with the cell parameter a=6.23 Å. This initial volume is computed by first employing the atomic/ionic radii to estimate the total volume occupied by the atoms in the solid state and then multiplying this number by a sufficiently large factor (typically between 3 and 10), to allow the atoms enough freedom to reach any arrangement independent of the initial random placement in the simulation cell. This factor was varied in preliminary calculations, where it was found that choosing a larger volume than the one selected (6.233 Å3 = 242 Å3, which is already by a factor of ~  5 larger than the volume of e.g. the zincblende structure) did not lead to significantly different results.

Each simulated annealing run had a length of 12500 steps, and the initial temperature of 1.00 eV (corresponding to 11604 Kelvin) was reduced to ~   0.78 eV at the end of the run. The length is thus somewhat longer than in the case of LiF [\cite=DollPCCP], because it is more difficult to approach possible candidate structures in a system with covalent bonds. The simulated annealing was followed by a quench with 5000 steps, i.e. a simulated annealing run with a temperature of 0 eV, which means that only downhill moves are allowed during the quench. The quench thus moves the geometry obtained after the simulated annealing further towards a local minimum. The moves were chosen as: moving individual atoms (70%), exchanging atoms (10%), changing the lattice parameters with fixed fractional coordinates (10%), changing the lattice parameters with fixed cartesian coordinates (5%), and changing the origin (5%, this move is important if subsequently the cell parameters change). No symmetry was prescribed during the simulated annealing and quench runs, i.e. the space group was always P1.

A minimum distance between two atoms (given by the sum of the radii of the atoms, multiplied with 0.7) was prescribed in order to avoid unrealistic geometries which may lead to numerical instabilities. The radii used were based on tabulated values for atomic and ionic radii, as a function of charge, and the Mulliken charge computed for the previous configuration. In those moves which change the lattice constant, the probability of reducing the lattice constant was enlarged to 60%, to speed up the reduction of the cell size.

The ab initio calculations were performed with the CRYSTAL06 code [\cite=Manual06], which is based on local Gaussian type orbitals. Two basis sets were used during the simulated annealing runs, starting from a

[formula]

exponents as in [\cite=Binkley1980]. In the case of basis set I, additional sp exponents of 0.4 for B and 0.3 for N were chosen, and the outermost exponent of the B 2sp contraction (0.4652) was removed. In the case of basis set II, the outer sp exponents were chosen as 0.25 for B and 0.297 for N. The basis sets are given in table [\ref=Basissetssimannlocopt]. In the stage of the local optimization, the basis sets used were the

Results and discussion

The most relevant structures found are displayed in figures [\ref=schichten],[\ref=186-216-136],[\ref=62-8], and [\ref=14-9], visualized with XCrysDen [\cite=XCrysDen]. Optimized geometries are given in table [\ref=Structuresfound]. First, the experimentally observed Bk structure was obtained (so-called hexagonal boron nitride, space group 194). Closely related are two additional layered structures, with space group 160 and 187, respectively. In the Bk structure, sheets are made of edge-connected six-membered rings of 3 boron and 3 nitrogen atoms in alternating sequence (see figure [\ref=schichten], left). The neighboring sheets are stacked vertically below and above, with alternating atoms (i.e. N sits vertically above B, and vice versa; the stacking order is ABAB). In space group 160, the same sheets are formed, but only three atoms have neighbors in the layer above, and the other three atoms have neighbors in the layer below (the stacking order is ABCABC, i.e. like in rhombohedral BN [\cite=Ishii1981]). The structure with space group 187 has stacking order ABAB, where again three atoms have neighbors vertically above and below in the next layer. These three layered structures have a very similar total energy, and also the enthalpy as a function of pressure looks very similar (see figure [\ref=LDAenthalpies]).

The wurtzite structure is displayed in figure [\ref=186-216-136], left. The zincblende structure is displayed in figure [\ref=186-216-136], middle, and has a similar energy as the wurtzite structure. At zero pressure, the energies of the wurtzite and zincblende structure are comparable to that of the layered structures in figure [\ref=schichten].

The structure with space group 136 has six-membered rings (3 B, 3 N, alternating), but also rings with 4 (2 B, 2 N) atoms. This leads to angles close to 90[formula] and a less favorable energy (see figure [\ref=186-216-136], right). This structure corresponds to the β-BeO type [\cite=Smith1965], which demonstrates that the method presented gives reasonable low-lying structure candidates: as Be has one electron less than B, and O one more than N, it makes sense that such the β-BeO structures is found as a candidate structure also for BN. Under ambient conditions, BeO crystallizes in the wurtzite structure, and the β-BeO structure is found as a high temperature phase [\cite=Smith1965].

The structure with space group 62 has four-, six- and eight membered rings. The topology is similar to the one of the aluminum network in the SrAl2 structure under ambient pressure (space group 74, Imma): one has to replace one aluminum atom with boron, the neighboring one with nitrogen, and discard the strontium. This is reasonable, as the two aluminum atoms obtain two electrons from strontium and thus have 8 valence electrons together, i.e. the same number of valence electrons as one boron and one nitrogen atom together. The structure with space group 14 consists of layers - each of them consisting of rings with four or eight atoms. Finally, two structures with relatively large channels (i.e. large regions in the unit cell without atoms) were found, with space groups 8 and 9, respectively.

The geometries are in reasonable agreement with the available experimental data in table [\ref=expstructures]. The computed cell parameter a and the interlayer distance are approximatively constant for the layered structures with only six-membered rings (with space groups 194, 160, 187); this is also observed in the experiment when comparing the Bk and the rhombohedral structure.

Total energies and statistics are given in table [\ref=StructuresEnergies]. The five energetically lowest lying structures found were the layered structures (space group 194, 160, 187) and the wurtzite and zincblende structure. At zero pressure, LDA favors wurtzite and zincblende (by 0.05 Eh per four formula units), whereas B3LYP (by 0.01 Eh) and Hartree-Fock favor the layered structures. This is in reasonable agreement with other calculations, e.g. reference [\cite=Albe1997] and references therein gives the layered structure by ~  0.06 eV/atom (0.02 Eh per four formula units) higher than the wurtzite and zincblende structures. Also, the zincblende and wurtzite structure are nearly degenerate, and similarly the hexagonal and rhombohedral structure. These results are stable with respect to the choice of the basis set, as calculations with larger basis sets show (see appendix [\ref=basissetextrapolation]).

The statistics shows that the layered structures are frequently found, as well as the 3d-structures such as wurtzite or zincblende. The statistics includes all runs where Hartree-Fock energies were used during the simulated annealing. 10 runs were performed, where the B3LYP functional was used during the simulated annealing procedure. In two of these runs, a good structure candidate was found (wurtzite and the layered structure with space group 160). However, as was mentioned, the B3LYP runs require much more CPU time, and therefore the runs were mainly performed using the Hartree-Fock approach during the simulated annealing. In total, about 16 % of the runs gave one of the structure candidates in table [\ref=StructuresEnergies]. The other runs yielded either no good structure candidates (like "amorphous" structures) or only energetically very unfavorable structures.

When pressure is applied, the lower coordinated structures become less favorable, which is in agreement with the rule that the coordination number increases with pressure, see e.g.[\cite=MuellerBuch]. The enthalpies are displayed in figure [\ref=LDAenthalpies] for LDA, and for B3LYP, respectively. Interestingly, in the case of B3LYP the layered structures are favorable at zero pressure, with wurtzite and zincblende becoming favorable at a pressure of ~   3 GPa.

Conclusion

It was shown that structure prediction based on simulated annealing and using ab-initio energies during both the global and local optimization is feasible for a covalent system such as boron nitride. This is a significant extension of the previous work [\cite=DollPCCP] where this approach was shown to be feasible for an ionic system. Covalent systems are more difficult to study as covalent bonds need to be established between the neighbors, and convergence problems are more severe in this case. Three layered structures, the wurtzite and zincblende structure, a structure of the β-BeO type, and four other favorable structures were found. Applying pressure leads to a preference of the higher coordinated structures.

Larger basis sets to extrapolate the basis set limit

In the present work, a main task is to compute the energy differences between various structures. Besides the functional, the choice of the basis set has an influence on these results. In order to investigate this in more detail, the basis set used for the local optimization was further enlarged, and the total energies were computed for the most important structures. Here, enlarging the basis set means to include more diffuse functions. It turned out that this was only possible for the nitrogen atom, whereas more diffuse functions on boron led to linear dependence problems. Therefore, in a first step, one sp shell with exponent 0.15 was added to the nitrogen basis set III in table [\ref=Basissetssimannlocopt], which resulted in a

[formula]

basis set was obtained (basis set V). Note that these basis sets work reasonably well at zero pressure, but numerical instability sets in with compression, i.e. enthalpies (as in figure [\ref=LDAenthalpies]) could only be obtained up to a relatively small pressure.

A geometry optimization was performed with these basis sets. The results are displayed in table [\ref=Basisbenchmark]. It becomes obvious, that the energy differences between the various structures remain essentially constant; the total energy becomes lower with increasing basis set. This is visualized in figure [\ref=basissatzvergleich].

The geometry slightly changes when enlarging the basis set. Most prominent is the change of the c-axis for the layered structures when the basis set is enlarged. This is due to the weak bonding between the individual layers. However, as a whole, the basis set does not change the relative energies between the structures.
