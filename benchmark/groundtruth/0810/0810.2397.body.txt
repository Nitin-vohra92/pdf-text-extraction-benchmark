On a class of multidimensional integrable hierarchies and their reductions

Introduction

Using a construction developed in [\cite=BDM06] [\cite=BDM07], we describe a structure of general integrable hierarchy connected with commutation of (N + 1)-dimensional vector fields (containing a derivative over spectral variable), which defines (N + 2)-dimensional integrable equations. We consider several special cases of the general hierarchy and its reductions, some of them defining known integrable models. The simplest case of (1+1)-dimensional vector field (one space variable and a spectral variable) corresponds to (2+1)-dimensional integrable system introduced by Manakov and Santini [\cite=MS06] (see also [\cite=MS07] [\cite=MS08]). The case of (2+1)-dimensional vector fields (two space variables and a spectral variable), after a reduction to volume-preserving vector fields, leads to (2+2)-dimensional Dunajski integrable model [\cite=Dun02], describing anti-self-dual Einstein-Maxwell equation for signature (2,2)(twistor setting).

General (N + 2)-dimensional hierarchy

To define general hierarchy, we consider N + 1 formal series, depending on N infinite sets of additional variables ('times')

[formula]

where [formula], [formula]. We denote [formula] and introduce the projectors [formula], [formula].

The general hierarchy is defined by the generating relation

[formula]

where the differential includes both times and a spectral variable,

[formula]

and J0 is a determinant of Jacobian matrix Jij,

[formula]

where xk = tk0. Equation ([\ref=analyticity0]) is a generating relation for Lax-Sato form of the hierarchy.

Relation ([\ref=analyticity0]) is equivalent to the set of equations

[formula]

The proof of this proposition is completely analogous to the similar proof given in [\cite=BDM07] for Dunajski hierarchy. The proof of ([\ref=analyticity0]) ⇒   hierarchy ([\ref=genSato]) is based on the following statement.

Given identity ([\ref=analyticity0]), for arbitrary first order operator Û,

[formula]

with 'plus' coefficients ((uki)- = u0- = 0), the condition [formula] (where for Ψk, k  ≠  0, derivatives of series ([\ref=formk]) are taken with fixed Ψ0) implies that [formula].

The statement ([\ref=genSato]) ⇒   ([\ref=analyticity0]) directly follows from the relation

[formula]

where τi, [formula], is an arbitrary set of times of the hierarchy, and Vjτi  + are the coefficients of corresponding vector fields given by the r.h.s. of equations ([\ref=genSato]),

[formula]

Similar to [\cite=BDM07], it is also possible to prove that Lax-Sato flows of the hierarchy ([\ref=genSato]) are compatible.

Manakov-Santini hierarchy

A simplest case of general hierarchy ([\ref=genSato]) with N = 1 is connected with the system recently introduced by Manakov and Santini [\cite=MS06]. For this hierarchy we have two series

[formula]

and generating relation

[formula]

Lax-Sato equations for Manakov-Santini hierarchy read

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

Lax-Sato equations for the first two flows are given by

[formula]

where u = Ψ01, v = Ψ11. Compatibility condition for these equations reperesents a system of equations for u, v,

[formula]

This system was introduced by Manakov and Santini in [\cite=MS06] (see also [\cite=MS07], [\cite=MS08]). For v = 0 the system reduces to the dKP equation

[formula]

Respectively, u = 0 reduction gives an equation [\cite=Pavlov03] (see also [\cite=Dun04] [\cite=MS02] [\cite=MS04])

[formula]

More generally, to reduce Manakov-Santini hierarchy ([\ref=genSato1]) to dispersionless KP hierarchy, one should consider a reduction J0 = 1 (area preservation or Hamiltonian condition), then from Lax-Sato equations ([\ref=genSato1]) one easily gets Lax-Sato equations for dKP hierarchy.

Respectively, reduction Ψ0  =  λ leads to the hierarchy connected with equation ([\ref=Pavlov]), which was considered in [\cite=MS02] [\cite=MS04].

Dunajski equation hierarchy

This hierarchy is connected with the integrable model introduced by Dunajski [\cite=Dun02], which generalizes the famous Plebanski second heavenly equation. It corresponds to general hierarchy with N = 2 with volume-preserving reduction (J0 = 1). To define this hierarchy, we introduce three series

[formula]

Generating equation for Dunajski equation hierarchy is of the form

[formula]

(taking into account the reduction J0 = 1). Lax-Sato equations of the hierarchy read

[formula]

[formula]

(plus a condition J0 = 1). It is easy to check that for Ψ0  =  λ Dunajski equation hierarchy reduces to heavenly equation hierarchy [\cite=Takasaki] [\cite=Takasaki1], while for Ψ2 = y it reduces to dispersionless KP hierarchy. The first two flows of the hierarchy ([\ref=Dun11]), ([\ref=Dun21]) read

[formula]

here

[formula]

condition det J0 = 1 implies that uy + vx = 0, and we can introduce a potential Θ, v = Θy, u =  - Θx After the identification z =  - t11, w = t21, we get Lax pair for Dunajski system

[formula]

The second flows can be written in the form

[formula]

To write down vector field more explicitly, one should use the first flows ([\ref=fl01]), ([\ref=fl02]). Commutation relations for any pair of the flows give an equation for Θ, f (with different set of times).

Dressing scheme

Let us consider nonlinear vector Riemann problem of the form

[formula]

where [formula], [formula] denote the boundary values of the (N+1)-component vector function on the sides of some oriented curve γ in the complex plane of the variable λ. The problem is to find the function analytic outside the curve with some fixed behavior at infinity (normalization) which satisfies ([\ref=Riemann]). The problem of this type was used by Takasaki [\cite=Takasaki0] [\cite=Takasaki] [\cite=Takasaki1], who stressed its connection to Penrose nonlinear graviton construction.

The problem ([\ref=Riemann]) is connected with a class of integrable equations, which can be represented as a commutation relation for vector fields containing a derivative on the spectral variable. We give a sketch of the dressing scheme corresponding to the general (N+2)-dimensional integrable hierarchy ([\ref=analyticity0]), ([\ref=genSato]). First, we chose γ as a unit circle. To get solutions of the general hierarchy using the problem ([\ref=Riemann]), one should find solution to this problem with the singulariries at λ  =    ∞   defined by the series ([\ref=form0]), ([\ref=formk]) (for simplicity we suggest that only a final number of times is not equal to zero). If the determinant J0 for this solution is not equal to zero, we come to the conclusion that the form

[formula]

is analytic in the complex plane, and so it satisfies the generating identity ([\ref=analyticity0]). Then the solution of the Riemann problemm ([\ref=Riemann]) satisfies Lax-Sato equations ([\ref=genSato]) and provides a solution for the general (N+2)-dimensional hierarchy.

Due to the fact that singularities of solution of the Riemann problem are defined by the series ([\ref=form0]), ([\ref=formk]) using the solution itself, solution of the hierarchy is usually defined in terms of implicit functions.
