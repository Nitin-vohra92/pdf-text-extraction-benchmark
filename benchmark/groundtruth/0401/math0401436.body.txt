The weak Paley-Wiener property for group extensions

Introduction

The weak Paley-Wiener property (wPW) can be formulated as follows: Let G be a second countable, type I locally compact group, and define

[formula]

Then G has wPW if

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the operator-valued Fourier transform on L1(G), and the measure νG on Ĝ is the Plancherel measure of G.

The statement originated from real Fourier analysis. The fact that [formula] has wPW follows easily from the observation that the Fourier transform of a compactly supported function is analytic. An even simpler argument works for [formula]; Fourier transforms of elements of [formula] are trigonometric polynomials. On the other hand, the circle group [formula] does not have wPW, for obvious reasons. wPW has been proved for various (unimodular, type I) groups, in particular connected, simply connected nilpotent Lie groups [\cite=Mo] [\cite=Pa] [\cite=Gar1] [\cite=LipRos] [\cite=ArnLud]; with generalisations to completey solvable groups [\cite=Gar2].

The property can be viewed as an uncertainty principle: If f is compactly supported, [formula] is spread over all of Ĝ. It is interesting to compare wPW to the so-called qualitative uncertainty property (Q.U.P.) studied in [\cite=Hog] [\cite=EchKanKum] [\cite=ArnLud], stating for all f∈L1(G) that

[formula]

where μG is left Haar measure, νG is Plancherel measure and supp denotes the measure-theoretic support (unique up to a null set). By contrast to wPW, this property is obviously not invariant under choice of equivalent Plancherel measures, but rather rests on a canonical choice (which is available for unimodular groups).

Throughout this paper G denotes a type I locally compact group and N a closed normal subgroup of type I, which is in addition regularly embedded. All groups are assumed to be second countable. The aim is to give sufficient criteria that G has wPW, in terms of analogous properties of N and the little fixed groups.

The paper is structured as follows: We first give a review of the Mackey machine and its uses for the computation of Plancherel measure via techniques due to Kleppner and Lipsman. We then present explicit formulas for the induced representations arising in the construction of Ĝ, and for the associated representations of L1(G), which act via certain operator-valued integral kernels. These formulas will allow to prove the main result of this paper, Theorem [\ref=thm:main], essentially by repeated application of Fubini's theorem. In the final section we apply Theorem [\ref=thm:main] to prove wPW for a large class of simply connected, connected solvable Lie groups (Theorem [\ref=thm:wPW_solv]), thereby considerably generalising the previously published results for nilpotent and completely solvable groups given in [\cite=Mo] [\cite=Pa] [\cite=Gar1] [\cite=LipRos] [\cite=ArnLud] [\cite=Gar2]. Further consequences are criteria for nonunimodular groups (Corollary [\ref=cor:nonunimod]), and a characterisation of wPW for motion groups (Theorem [\ref=thm:motion]).

Plancherel measure of group extensions

We follow the exposition in [\cite=Li]. For further details and notation not explained here, the reader is referred to this monograph. Throughout the paper we assume that G is a type I group, and that [formula] is a regularly embedded, type I normal subgroup. Left Haar measure on a locally compact group is denoted by |  ·  |, and integration against left Haar measure by [formula]. Given a multiplier ω on G, Ĝω denotes the (equivalence classes of) irreducible unitary ω-representations; ω is omitted when it is trivial. [formula] is the multiplier obtained by complex conjugation. A multiplier ω is called type I if all ω-representations generate type I von Neumann algebras.

Since we are also dealing with nontrivial Mackey-obstructions, we need to recall a multiplier version of the Plancherel theorem. Given a multiplier ω on G, we denote by λG,ω the ω-representation of G, acting on L2(G) via

[formula]

If ω is type I, there exists a Plancherel measure (unique up to equivalence) νG,ω on Ĝω decomposing λG,ω,

[formula]

The associated Fourier transform is given by

[formula]

ω is omitted whenever it is trivial.

For completeness, we mention the construction of the Plancherel transform associated to the Plancherel measure. In the unimodular case, the measure νG can be chosen so that for [formula] the operator field Fω(f) is in fact a field of Hilbert-Schmidt operators satisfying

[formula]

and the Fourier transform extends by density to a unitary equivalence between L2(G) and the direct integral of Hilbert-Schmidt spaces. The nonunimodular setting requires right multiplication of Fω(f) with a field of unbounded, densely defined selfadjoint operators with densely defined inverse. In particular, it does not matter whether we formulate wPW with reference to operator-valued Fourier- or Plancherel transform, though the first one is obviously simpler.

Mackey's theory rests on the dual action of G on N̂. We assume that N is regularly embedded, i.e., the orbit space N̂ / G is countably separated. For γ∈N̂ let Gγ denote the fixed group under the dual action. Now Mackey's theory provides Ĝ as the disjoint union

[formula]

Here ωγ denotes the multiplier associated to γ, and γ' denotes a fixed choice of an ωγ-representation of Gγ on Hγ extending γ. Finally, [formula] is identified with its "lift" to Gγ. In the following, we use the notation

[formula]

Note that under our assumptions, it follows from a theorem due to Mackey that all [formula] are type I (see e.g. [\cite=Li]). Thus we have description of Ĝ as a "fibred set", with base space N̂ / G and fibre

[formula]

associated to G.γ. Moreover, there exist Plancherel measures on N̂ as well as on [formula]. Now νG is obtained by taking the projective Plancherel measures in the fibres, and "glueing" them together using a pseudo-image [formula] of νN on N̂, i.e. the quotient measure of a finite measure equivalent to νN. In formulas, up to equivalence νG is given according to [\cite=KlLi] by

[formula]

But [formula] also enters in a measure decomposition of νN: There exists quasi-invariant measures μG.γ on the orbits G.γ∈N̂ / G such that

[formula]

In view of the "fibrewise" description of Ĝ it is useful to generalise the wPW notion to multipliers:

Let G be a locally compact group and ω a type I multiplier on G. Then G has ω-wPW, if for every nonzero f∈L∞c(G), Fω(f) does not vanish on a set of positive ω-Plancherel measure.

Now we have collected enough terminology to formulate the main result of this paper.

Let G be type I, [formula] a type I regularly embedded normal subgroup, with the additional property that for almost γ∈N̂, G / Gγ carries an invariant measure.

Assume that, for almost all γ∈Ĝ, Gγ / N has [formula]-wPW. Moreover assume that the following condition holds:

[formula]

Then G has wPW.

Conversely, if G has wPW, then ([\ref=eqn:inv_wPW]) holds.

The existence of invariant measures on G / Gγ is ensured if G / N is abelian or compact. Note that relation () holds in particular when N has wPW.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:main]

The proof uses ideas and techniques very similar to those in [\cite=KlLi]. It rests on the interplay of several measure decompositions: Of Haar measure on G along shifts of subgroups on the group side, and of the Plancherel measures νG and νN according to ([\ref=eqn:Pl_meas]) and ([\ref=eqn:meas_decomp_Pl]).

For explicit calculations it is convenient to realize induced representations IndGHσ on L2(G / H;Hσ). Then the integrated representation acts on this space via operator-valued kernels. The proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:main] uses explicit formulas for these kernels, and their relationship to Fourier transforms of restrictions of φ to cosets mod N. In the following, the restriction of a map f to a subset Y of its domain is denoted by f|Y. f|Y  =  0 is to be understood in the sense of vanishing almost everywhere (with respect to a measure that is clear from the context).

First let us recall a few basic results concerning cross-sections, quasi-invariant measures and measure decompositions. If H < G, then a cross-section α:G / H  →  G is a measurable mapping fulfilling α(ξ)H  =  ξ, for all ξ  =  gH∈G / H. A cross-section G / H  →  G is called regular if images of compact subsets are relatively compact. All cross-sections in this paper are assumed to be regular, which is justified by the following lemma.

If G is second countable and H  <  G closed, there exists a regular cross-section.

Given a cross-section, we may parametrise G by the map

[formula]

This particular choice of parametrisation seems a bit peculiar, since it refers to right cosets rather than left ones. Its benefit will become apparent in the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:induced].

Let us first take a closer look at the form that left Haar measure on G takes in the parametrisation ([\ref=eqn:par_G_1]). We assume that G / H carries an invariant measure, denoted in the following by dξ.

For all f∈L∞c(G),

[formula]

Next we note a few technical details concerning the behaviour of restrictions of an L∞c-function to shifts of subgroups. For this purpose one further piece of notation is necessary: The left- and right translation operators on G, denoted by Rx,Ly, act via

[formula]

Let φ∈L∞c(G) and H < G; let α:G / H  →  G be a cross-section mapping compact sets to relatively compact sets. Consider the mapping

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the L1-norm on H.

Given a compact set K  ⊂  G / H, the set

[formula]

is relatively compact.

C is bounded on compact subsets of G / H  ×  G / H.

Now we can compute the action of the induced representation.

Let G be a locally compact group, H < G closed and σ a representation of H acting on a separable Hilbert space Hσ. Let α:G / H  →  G be a Borel cross-section and assume that there exists an invariant measure on G / H. We realise π  =  IndGHσ on the corresponding vector-valued space L2(G / H;Hσ) using α. Then π acts via

[formula]

For φ∈L∞c(G), π(φ) acts via

[formula]

where the right hand side converges in the weak sense for all ξ∈G / H, and Φ is an operator-valued integral kernel given by

[formula]

Moreover, we have the equivalence

[formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:main]. Let φ∈L∞c(G) be given with π(φ)  =  0 for π in a set of positive Plancherel measure. Then, by ([\ref=eqn:Pl_meas]), there exists a G-invariant subset Γ  ⊂  N̂ of positive Plancherel measure and subsets [formula] (γ∈Γ) with

[formula]

Now fix γ∈Γ. Our aim is to relate the equation πG.γ,σ(φ) = 0 for σ in a set of positive projective Plancherel measure in [formula] to certain Fourier transforms, using the integral kernel calculus. For this purpose we use Borel cross-sections α:G / Gγ  →  G and ϑ:Gγ  /  N  →  Gγ. In the following calculations, all quotients carry invariant measures. We also need the continuous homomorphism [formula] defined by picking B  ⊂  N of positive finite measure and letting [formula].

By Lemma [\ref=lem:induced], πG.γ,σ(φ) has the operator-valued kernel

[formula]

where

[formula]

Here it is important to note that for fixed (ξ,ξ'), the operator-valued function Fξ,ξ' has compact support: A short calculation establishes that

[formula]

only if h∈α(ξ')- 1(supp(φ))- 1α(ξ)- 1N = :K0, and K0 is a compact subset of G / N  ⊃  Gγ / N. Moreover, for h∈K0

[formula]

The middle term is the measure of a fixed relatively compact subset of N, by regularity of ϑ, and the last term is bounded on the compact support. Hence the map [formula] is in L∞c(Gγ / N).

Now, for fixed γ∈Γ and σ∈BG.γ, relation ([\ref=eqn:ker_vanish]) and ΔG  >  0 imply that

[formula]

for almost every (ξ,ξ'), where the set of these (ξ,ξ') may depend on σ. However, an application of Fubini's Theorem provides a conull subset of C  ⊂  G / Gγ  ×  G / Gγ, such that ([\ref=eqn:kernel_vanish_1]) holds for all (ξ,ξ')∈C and all σ in a conull subset of BG.γ, possibly depending on (ξ,ξ'). Now fix (ξ,ξ')∈C, as well as ONB's (ηi)i∈I  ⊂  Hγ, (βj)j∈J  ⊂  Hσ. It follows that

[formula]

where we used that dh is left Haar measure on Gγ / N, and the scalar-valued function Ψi,k given by

[formula]

In particular Ψi,k∈L∞c(Gγ / N). Thus we are finally in a position to use the assumption that Gγ / N has [formula]-wPW, yielding for all i,k that Ψi,k = 0 on a joint conull subset. But this clearly entails Fξ,ξ'(h)  =  0 almost everywhere.

Since obviously

[formula]

our considerations so far have established for fixed γ∈Γ, that for almost all (ξ,ξ',h)∈G / Gγ  ×  G / Gγ  ×  Gγ / N

[formula]

Now choose a measurable cross-section Λ:G / N  →  G. By definition of the Borel structure on N̂, the map

[formula]

is Borel. Moreover, for a fixed ξ∈G / Gγ, the set

[formula]

is a set of representatives of G / N, since N is normal. In particular, for every s∈G / N there exists (ξ',h)∈G / Gγ  ×  Gγ / N such that NΛ(s)- 1  =  Nα(ξ)ϑ(h)- 1α(ξ')- 1. Hence Λ(s)- 1  =  nα(ξ)ϑ(h)- 1α(ξ')- 1, for suitable n∈N. Thus ([\ref=eqn:ker_vanish_ae]) implies that for fixed γ∈Γ and almost all ξ∈G / Gγ the set

[formula]

has a complement of measure zero.

On the other hand, ξ  ↦  α(ξ).γ yields a bijection between G / Gγ and G.γ, and the image of the invariant measure on G / Gγ is equivalent to the measure μG.γ appearing in ([\ref=eqn:meas_decomp_Pl]). Summarising, we obtain that

[formula]

Here the second equation uses the measure decomposition ([\ref=eqn:meas_decomp_Pl]) and Fubini's Theorem. But the latter integral implies for almost all s∈G / N, that [formula] on the G-invariant subset Γ  ⊂  N̂. Since [formula], an appeal to assumption ([\ref=eqn:inv_wPW]) yields [formula] for almost every coset s. Hence φ = 0, which finishes the proof of (a).

For the proof of (b), assume that [formula] is a counterexample to ([\ref=eqn:inv_wPW]), i.e. there exists a G-invariant [formula] of positive measure such that [formula] vanishes on Γ. Let K  ⊂  G / N be some compact set of positive measure, and let Λ:G / N  →  G be a cross-section. Then

[formula]

defines a nonzero φ∈L∞c(G). Let Σ  =  {π∈Ĝ:(π)  =  0}. We intend to show πG.γ,σ∈Σ for all [formula] and all [formula]. By equation ([\ref=eqn:ker_explicit]) this amounts to proving

[formula]

where α,ϑ are cross-sections associated to Gγ / N and G / Gγ. Now for n∈N,

[formula]

where s  =  α(ξ')ϑ(h)α(ξ)- 1N and n'∈N is suitably chosen, and independent of n. Since α(ξ).γ∈Σ, it follows that

[formula]

Hence we can compute

[formula]

therefore φ is the desired counterexample to wPW on G. [formula]

Applications and Examples

In this section we apply Theorem [\ref=thm:main] to a variety of cases, and discuss the necessity of its assumptions. Unless otherwise stated, our standing assumptions are: G is second countable, G and [formula] are of type I, with N regularly embedded.

Assume that the dual action of G / N is free νN-almost everywhere. Then G has wPW iff condition () holds.

Let G be nonunimodular, and N  =  Ker(ΔG). Then G has wPW iff () holds; in particular, if N has wPW.

For split compact extensions the freeness of the operation turns out to be necessary also. Since a compact group has wPW iff it is trivial, the next theorem provides a class of extensions for which the conditions of Theorem [\ref=thm:main] are necessary and sufficient.

Assume that [formula], with K compact. Then G has wPW iff condition ([\ref=eqn:inv_wPW]) holds and the dual action of G / N is free νN-almost everywhere.

Applying the theorem to motion groups yields that [formula] has wPW iff n  ≤  2.

Another extreme case is given by an almost everywhere trivial action of G / N on Ĝ. The following corollary also covers direct product groups.

Assume that G / N acts trivially νN-almost everywhere. If G has wPW, then N has wPW. Conversely, if both N and G / N have wPW, then so does G.

Note that G / N need not have wPW, even if G does: Simply take [formula] and [formula].

A result similar to the following is formulated for the so-called topological Paley-Wiener condition in [\cite=KaLaSc].

Suppose that G / N is abelian and compact-free. Assume in addition that either almost all Mackey obstructions vanish, or that G / N is compactly generated. Then, if condition [\ref=eqn:inv_wPW] holds, G has wPW.

Let [formula], and ω a type I multiplier on G. Then G has ω-wPW.

We will next show that iterated application of Corollary [\ref=cor:abelian_ext] allows to establish wPW for a large class of solvable Lie groups, thus extending the results from [\cite=LipRos] [\cite=Gar1] [\cite=ArnLud] [\cite=Gar2]. In the following, the term "Lie group" is shorthand for simply connected, connected Lie group. We first start with an observation that is probably folklore, and which ensures that Corollary [\ref=cor:abelian_ext] can be used iteratively. We include a proof since we could not obtain a reference.

Let G be an exponential Lie group and [formula] a closed connected nilpotent normal subgroup. Then N is regularly embedded.

For the formulation of the next theorem recall that the nilradical N of a solvable Lie group G is defined as the maximal connected nilpotent normal subgroup of G. Hence [formula] is simply connected, with [formula] [\cite=AuMo]. Recall also that nilpotent, or more generally, exponential Lie groups are of type I [\cite=Ta]. A class R solvable Lie group is defined by the requirement that for all x∈G and for all eigenvalues λ of Ad(x), |x| = 1 [\cite=AuMo]. By contrast, exponential Lie groups are characterised by the property that no eigenvalue of any Ad(x) is purely imaginary [\cite=BeCo].

Let G be a solvable Lie group, and let [formula] denote the nilradical. Assume that G is type I and that N is regularly embedded. Then G has wPW. In particular, G has wPW if it is exponential, or if it is of class R and type I.

If G is a solvable CCR Lie group, it has wPW.

Let us next give a class of group extensions that fail to have wPW, namely those where the normal subgroup is (nontrivial and) compact. For this purpose, an alternative formulation of wPW, which has the additional advantage of applying also to the non-type I setting, is observed:

If G is type I, then the following conditions are equivalent:

G has wPW.

Every nonzero f∈L∞c(G) is cyclic for the two-sided representation of G acting on L2(G).

For all nonzero f∈L∞c(G) and nonzero every two-sided invariant operator T on L2(G), [formula].

(ii)  ⇔  (iii) is [\cite=DiW]. For (i)  ⇒  (iii) let f∈L∞c(G) and let T denote a two-sided invariant operator. Under the Plancherel transform,

[formula]

for a certain Borel mapping m∈L∞(Ĝ). If [formula], m does not vanish identically. But then (i) implies that

[formula]

does not vanish identically, thus [formula]. For (iii)  ⇒  (i) assume that [formula] vanishes on a set Σ  ⊂  N̂ of positive Plancherel measure. Let P denote the projection defined by

[formula]

Then P is two-sided invariant, nontrivial, but Pf = 0.

Similar arguments apply to show that the following conditions are equivalent, for regularly embedded [formula]:

Condition ([\ref=eqn:inv_wPW]) holds.

Every nonzero f∈L∞c(N) is cyclic for the von-Neumann algebra generated by the two-sided representation of N and the representation of G acting on L2(N) by conjugation.

For all nonzero f∈L∞c(N) and nonzero two-sided invariant operator T on L2(N) commuting with the conjugation action of G, [formula].

If G has wPW, it has no nontrivial compact normal subgroups.

Proposition [\ref=prop:cp_norm] in fact follows from [\cite=KaLaSc], where it is stated for the topological Paley-Wiener condition. Note that the topological Paley-Wiener condition is weaker than wPW. [\cite=KaLaSc] shows that for SIN groups, the two conditions coincide with the necessary condition derived in the previous proposition.

An example where condition ([\ref=eqn:inv_wPW]) holds, but N does not have wPW is constructed as follows: Consider [formula], where [formula] denotes the field of p-adic numbers, and its unit group [formula] acts by multiplication. [formula] is self-dual, and the dual action of [formula] is again by multiplication. In particular, [formula] consists of the two dual orbits {0} (which has measure zero) and [formula]. Moreover, the action of [formula] on the large orbit is free. Hence Kleppner and Lipsman's theorem yields that the Plancherel measure is supported on a single point, and the wPW property is an immediate consequence of the Plancherel theorem. (Of course, Theorem [\ref=thm:main] also applies, with both conditions trivially fulfilled.)

On the other hand, [formula] has the nontrivial compact subgroup [formula], hence [formula] does not have wPW.
