ABSTRACT

We review two ways in which smooth cosmological evolution between two de Sitter phases can be obtained from M/string-theory. Firstly, we perform a hyperbolic reduction of massive type IIA* theory to D = 6 N = (1,1) SU(2)  ×  U(1) gauged de Sitter supergravity, which supports smooth cosmological evolution between dS4  ×  S2 and a dS6-type geometry. Secondly, we obtain four-dimensional de Sitter gravity with SU(2) Yang-Mills gauge fields from a hyperbolic reduction of standard eleven-dimensional supergravity. The four-dimensional theory supports smooth cosmological evolution between dS2  ×  S2 and a dS4-type geometry. Although time-dependent, these solutions arise from a first-order system via a superpotential construction. For appropriate choices of charges, these solutions describe an expanding universe whose expansion rate is significantly larger in the past than in the future, as required for an inflationary model.

D = 6 N = (1,1) de Sitter supergravity from massive type IIA*

The advantage of embedding de Sitter solutions in *   theories [\cite=hull1] [\cite=hull2] is that they can be viewed as "supersymmetric," even though the anti-commutators of the super-charges are no longer positive definite . The time-like T-dualization of type IIB theory can yield massive type IIA* supergravity, whose bosonic Lagrangian is given by [\cite=lvpdstods]

[formula]

where [formula], [formula] and [formula]. The hyperbolic reduction of massive type IIA* theory can be obtained as an analytical continuation of the S4 reduction [\cite=massive] of massive type IIA supergravity [\cite=romans]:

[formula]

where [formula], [formula] and [formula]. We have defined [formula], [formula], s =  sinh ξ, c =  cosh ξ and [formula]. σi are SU(2) left-invariant 1-forms which satisfy [formula]. *   is the six-dimensional Hodge dual. The resulting six-dimensional theory is given by

[formula]

where [formula], [formula] and [formula].

Since the theory allows us to truncate to U(1)2, we can include in our theory a vector-tensor multiplet with the Lagrangian given by

[formula]

where [formula] with [formula] and [formula]. The scalar potential is given by

[formula]

where X0 = (X1  X2)- 3 / 2. We consider the ansatz

[formula]

where the functions a and b depend only on the co-moving time coordinate τ and dΩ22 is the metric for the unit 2-sphere S2. A cosmological solution can be obtained from the following first-order equations [\cite=lvpdstods]

[formula]

provided that the two U(1) charges satisfy g  (λ1  +  λ2) = 1. The superpotential is given by [formula]. In particular, if λ1 = g- 1 and λ2 = 0, then we can consistently set φ1 = 2  φ2 and ([\ref=6]) can be solved explicitly. After the coordinate transformation [formula], the metric of the solution can be expressed as

[formula]

where

[formula]

The solution can be viewed as an intersection of a spatial domain wall wrapped on Ω2, characterized by the function H, and an S2-brane characterized by the function [formula]. This is a smooth cosmological solution in which the co-moving time runs from an infinite past, which is dS4  ×  S2, to an infinite future, which is a dS6-type geometry with the boundary R3  ×  S2.

For general values of qi, the first-order equations cannot be solved analytically. However, it is straightforward to find the fixed-point solution of dS4  ×  S2 where b and [formula] are constants. Using a numerical method, we have verified that there are cosmological solutions which run from dS4  ×  S2 in the infinite past and are of dS6-type in the future. The ratio of the Hubble constant in the infinite past and future can be straightforwardly calculated. In particular, for -  λ1  ≫  λ2, the ratio is given by

[formula]

which can be arbitrarily large. It is surprising that we can get a somewhat realistic cosmological model from a first-order system, which implies supersymmetry from the point of view of * theories [\cite=lvpdstods].

D = 4 Yang-Mills de Sitter gravity from M-theory

Four-dimensional de Sitter spacetime arises in standard eleven-dimensional supergravity as a warped product with a hyperbolic 7-space [\cite=gh]. The latter can be expressed as a foliation of two 3-spheres, on which SU(2) Yang-Mills fields can reside. This enables us to use the following reduction ansatz for D = 11 supergravity [\cite=ds]:

[formula]

where c =  cosh θ, s =  sinh θ, Δ  =   cosh (2θ), and * denotes the four-dimensional Hodge dual. σi and σ̃i are SU(2) left-invariant 1-forms and the vielbein hi and SU(2) Yang-Mills field strengths [formula] have been defined in the previous section. It is straightforward to verify that the Bianchi identity [formula] and the equation of motion [formula] are satisfied provided that the SU(2) Yang-Mills fields [formula] satisfy the lower-dimensional equations of motion [formula], where the covariant derivative D is defined by [formula], for any vector Vi.

The evaluation of the D = 11 Einstein equations of motion is substantially more complicated, and we have not performed the calculation in full detail. However, we have verified that the equations of motion work for the U(1) subsector of the SU(2) gauge fields. Combining the result, the lower-dimensional equations of motion can be obtained from the Lagrangian

[formula]

Thus, we have obtained four-dimensional Einstein SU(2) Yang-Mills de Sitter gauged gravity from D = 11 by consistent Kaluza-Klein reduction on a hyperbolic 7-space [\cite=ds].

A regular cosmological solution of ([\ref=d4lag]) is given by [\cite=adsbh]

[formula]

For [formula], this is smooth cosmological evolution between dS2  ×  S2 and a dS4-type geometry with the boundary of S2  ×  S1. It is straightforward to lift the solution back to D = 11 and obtain a regular cosmological solution in M-theory. The corresponding metric is given by

[formula]

Discussion

The crucial issue regarding both of the above cosmological solutions is their stability. Although the * theories are necessary from the point of view of time-like T-duality, they suffer from an instability due to the ghost-like nature of the supergravity fields. It is of interest, therefore, to further study whether the stability is protected by time-like T-duality or "supersymmetry." Our second example might be more appealing since it is embedded within standard eleven-dimensional supergravity. The optimistic view is that the time scale of the instability is large enough to, nevertheless, validate the cosmological solutions.

Metastable de Sitter vacua have recently been constructed in type IIB theory [\cite=kklt]. All moduli are frozen due to fluxes as well as corrections to the superpotential from Euclidean D-brane instantons or gaugino condensation. However, these techniques can only yield inflationary models under restrictive conditions [\cite=kklmmt]. If such moduli-freezing techniques can be incorporated into our smooth inflationary models, then this might greatly enhance the cosmological landscape of M-theory [\cite=susskind]. In particular, we would have cosmologies which smoothly evolve (without topological transitions) between de Sitter-type spacetimes of different dimensionalities.
