Normal forces in stationary spacetimes

For a particle with 4-velocity [formula], moving on a geodesic in a spacetime with timelike Killing vector [formula], it is well known that the quantity

[formula]

is conserved along the geodesic particle world line[\cite=Wald84]. The quantity E can then be taken to be a conserved mechanical energy (per unit particle mass), analogous to the classical mechanical energy that includes gravitational potential energy. In Newtonian mechanics this concept can be extended to particles that move under the influence of normal forces, forces that serve only to constrain the particle motion to a geometric path. Newtonian normal forces are orthogonal to the velocity of the particle, and therefore perform no work on the particle and do not change the mechanical energy. Here we show that this can also be made to apply for relativistic gravitation. We extend the idea of a normal forces to stationary spacetime, and we show that under the influence of such normal forces, the quantity E of Eq. ([\ref=defE]) is conserved. Though this concept is quite simple, basic, and potentially useful, it does not seem to appear in textbooks.

Our definition of normal force uses the operator [formula] which projects any vector [formula] to

[formula]

so that [formula] is orthogonal to [formula]. Using this operator, we take [formula] and [formula] respectively to be the spatial velocity and acceleration of the particle. Our condition that only normal forces are acting on a particle is the condition that the particle's spatial acceleration is orthogonal to its spatial velocity, or

[formula]

A straightforward substitution of Eq. ([\ref=Pdef]) into ([\ref=normalforcedef]) gives

[formula]

Since [formula] must be zero, and [formula] cannot be zero, it follows that

[formula]

We now take the derivative dE / dτ where E is the energy defined in Eq. ([\ref=defE]) and τ is proper time along the worldline:

[formula]

The last term Uαξα;βUβ vanishes if [formula] is a Killing vector, and the first term vanishes if the particle is acted on only by normal forces. The energy E is therefore constant along the worldline.

This extended concept of conserved mechanical energy is most usefully applied in a coordinate system with [formula], and the metric coefficients independent of time x0. (We use units in which c = G = 1 and other conventions of Misner et al.[\cite=MTW].) We suppose that the path to which the normal forces constrain the particle is specified through xj(λ), where xj is a spatial coordinate and λ is some curve parameter. We suppose also that the energy [formula] is specified. From [formula] we have

[formula]

Here and below, summation over spatial indices [formula] is understood. Equation ([\ref=UdotU]) gives us

[formula]

In this equation, the metric coefficients g00,g0j, and gij are known functions of xj, and hence of λ. The only unknown in Eq. ([\ref=UdotU2]), then, is dλ / dτ, and Eq. ([\ref=UdotU2]) is an ordinary differential equation for λ(τ). Once this is solved, xj(τ), and hence the dynamics, is completely determined.

As a simple explicit example, for the Schwarzschild spacetime expressed in the usual coordinates,

[formula]

we consider the "straight" curve r cos φ = b in the θ  =  π / 2 equatorial plane. From [formula] we have

[formula]

From this and r = b /  cos φ, we can find φ(τ), r(τ), φ(t), and so forth.

It is particularly interesting to see the effect of the normal force on [formula]. For geodesic motion in an azimuthally symmetric spacetime, L is a conserved quantity considered to be particle angular momentum per unit mass. For the nongeodesic motion along r cos φ = b, we have, from Eq. ([\ref=eom]), that

[formula]

Since L is not constant, we can conclude that the normal force applies a torque to the particle.
