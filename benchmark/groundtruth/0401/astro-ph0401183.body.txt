Nova Cygni 2001#2 was discovered by A. Tago and K. Matayama on Aug. 18 (Nakamura 2001) at a magnitude of 6.6 . The brightness decay from maximum was one of the fastest ever recorded and it shows characteristics of recurrent novae (Kiss et al. 2002). Time resolved photometry in 2002 Oct. by Balman et al. (2003) revealed large amplitude variations with a period of 8 or 11 hours which might be associated with its orbital period.

We observed V2275 Cyg beginning on HJD2452930.61 (2003 Oct 18) with the 1.8-m Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope (VATT). This was 790 days after maximum light. Observations continued the next night starting at HJD2452931.59. The CCD was binned 2×  2 providing a scale of 0.4 arcsec/pixel. V-band exposures were 120 seconds with 30 second readout time covering about 10 hours over the two nights. The resulting images were bias subtracted and flat-fielded and instrumental magnitudes were measured using aperture photometry. Three comparison stars near the nova (Figure 1) were also measured and their positions listed in Table 1. Approximate V-band magnitudes for the stars were estimated from zero-point and airmass coefficients measured at the VATT on earlier runs with standard magnitude errors estimated to be ±  0.05 mag.

The VATT light curves are shown in Figure 2 and were obtained by subtracting the instrumental magnitude of Star 1 from the nova instrumental magnitude. The light curve for Star 2 relative to Star 1 is also shown and demonstrates both stars were constant over the observing run. Variations in individual measurements show an RMS scatter of 0.01 mag per exposure for V  ~  18 mag stars.

V2275 Cyg clearly shows light variations with a full amplitude of 0.2 mag and a period of about 20 minutes as well as a slower brightening trend on both nights. At the time of the observations V2275 Cyg varied between 18.0 < V < 18.5 mag. The long-period variation suggests a period > 7 hours and may be the same phenomenon seen by Balman et al. (2003). The short period variation has not been previously observed and may a quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) or a stable periodicity such as a spinning white dwarf. Power-spectrum analysis gives a period of 0.410±  0.005 hours for the variation. A plot of this period against the normalized light curve is shown in Figure 3 and indicates that this period was stable over the two nights of data. This supports the possibility that the short-term light variations come from reprocessing of light from a asynchronous spinning white dwarf, but more data is needed to confirm the stability of the period.
