Remarks on n-dimensional Feynman diagrams, for example, which will appear in M-theory and in F-theory

'n-dimensional Feynman diagrams' ([formula]) will be used in physics in the near future. Here, we let 1-dimensional Feynman diagrams mean Feynman diagrams in 'usual' QFT (see [\cite=Feynman][\cite=PeskinSchroeder]). Furthermore, we let 2-dimensional Feynman diagrams mean world sheets in 'usual' superstring theory (see [\cite=GSW][\cite=Polchinski]). We introduce 'n-dimensional Feynman diagrams' as a generalization of the 1-, 2-dimensional Feynman diagrams as follows.

F-theory, M-theory (see [\cite=HullTownsend] [\cite=Johnson] [\cite=Schwarz] [\cite=Townsend] [\cite=Vafa] [\cite=Witten] ) etc. imply that particles are represented by manifolds whose dimensions are greater than one. Here, consider interaction of these particles and use perturbation theory like the 0-,1-dimensional particle case. Then we will be able to use manifolds whose dimensions are greater than two in order to represent the interaction. In this paper we call these manifolds n-dimensional Feynman diagrams or n-dimensional world membranes if the manifolds are n-dimensional ones. We may use not only manifolds but also CW complexes for particles and Feynman diagrams (See [\cite=DavisKirk] for CW complexes).

Suppose we will complete the high-dimensional particle theory (F-theory, M-theory etc.) without using perturbation theory or Feynman diagrams. However, the limit of the theories is 'usual' superstring theory or 'usual' QFT. Therefore, we will be able to consider n-dimensional Feynman diagrams.

Anyway, mathematically we can discuss n-dimensional Feynman diagrams.

In this paper we state some remarks on 'n-dimensional Feynman diagrams.'

We consider the case where we make two 3-vertex functions into a 4-vertex function. In this case there is a different feature between in the case of high dimensional Feynman diagrams and in the 1-, 2-dimensinal case.

Let m be any integer greater than two. Let M be a compact oriented connected m-manifold with boundary. Let [formula], where [formula] denotes a disjoint union and A1(resp.A2,A3) is a connected closed oriented manifold. Let the orientation of Ai be induced from M. Suppose that there is an orientation reversing diffeomorphism Ai  →  Aj, where we do not assume i = j or i  ≠  j. Let M' be diffeomorphic to M. Let [formula] and Al = A'l(l = 1,2,3). Take M and M'. Identify Ai and A'j by an orientation reversing diffeomorphism f:Ai  →  A'j and obtain a compact oriented connected m-manifold Wf from M and M'. Let SM be the set whose elements are the diffeomorphism classes of such Wf

For [formula], there is a compact oriented connected m-manifold M such that the above set SM is an infinite set.

Theorem 1 means that, for [formula], two 3-vertx functions can make infinitely many kinds of 4-vertex functions under some conditions. If m = 2, such M does not exist as string theorists and topologists know. For m = 1, they can say such does not.

The m = 3 case: Take a solid torus. Remove two open 3-balls from the solid torus, call it M. Note [formula]. Let f:T2  →  T2 be a diffeomorphism. Let Z be any 3-dimensional Lens space (see [\cite=Rolfsen] for Lens spaces). Take any oriented manifold which is made from Z by removing four open 3-balls, call it Z'. Then Z'∈S. Hence there are countably infinitely many Z', using the homology groups of Z'. Hence Theorem 1 is true in the m = 3 case.

The m > 3 case: Take D2  ×  Tm - 2, where Tm - 2 is an (m - 2)-dimensional torus. Remove two open m-balls from D2  ×  Tm - 2, call it M. Then S includes all manifolds which are made from all
