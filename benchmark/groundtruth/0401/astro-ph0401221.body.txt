The Link between Warm Molecular Disks in Maser Nuclei and Star Formation near the Black Hole at the Galactic Center

Introduction

The dynamical sphere of influence of the massive black hole (MBH) at the Galactic center, measuring 1 pc in radius, is host to a large number of luminous, massive, and hence young stars (e.g., [\citealt=Krabbe:95] [\citealt=Genzel:00]). The closest star to the MBH with detailed proper motion data, S0-2, has an apocenter distance of only [formula] and an eccentricity of ~  0.88 (e.g., [\citealt=Schoedel:02]). It is a B0-O8 dwarf with a mass of [formula] and an age of [formula] [\citep=Ghez:03a]. A number of other stars at radial distances [formula] exhibit properties similar to those of S0-2 (e.g., [\citealt=Ghez:03b]). At a projected distance [formula] from the MBH, a cluster containing seven blue supergiants, known as the IRS 13 complex, dominates the ionizing luminosity (e.g., [\citealt=Najarro:97]). At somewhat larger distances of 0.1 - 0.5, as many as ~  40 Wolf-Rayet stars have been observed [\citep=Genzel:03]. Since the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) mass of the Wolf-Rayet stars is [formula], this implies that the Galactic center had been host to a recent starburst with a total initial stellar mass of greater than [formula].

Various dynamical mechanisms by which young stars could have migrated from larger radii into a fraction of the central parsec have been considered [\citep=Gerhard:01] [\citep=Gould:03] [\citep=KimS:03]. None are successful at explaining the observed concentration of young stars, unless an additional, hitherto undetected dynamical component, such as an intermediate-mass black hole, is invoked [\citep=Hansen:03]. This conclusion, therefore, suggests that the stars have probably formed in-situ. Molecular cloud densities of 1014- 3 at the radius corresponding to the apocenter distance of S0-2, and those of 109 - 1010- 3 at the orbital radii of the Wolf-Rayet stars, are required for gravitational collapse to occur in the presence of the Sagittarius A* tide [\citep=Morris:93]. The densities of molecular cloud fragments found in the central 2 pc of the Galaxy, however, do not exceed [formula] (e.g., [\citealt=Jackson:93]).

The densities necessary for gravitational collapse in the tidal field of the MBH could easily be sustained in accretion disks. The young stars may be connected to a past accretion disk at the Galactic center since their orbits appear to lie within one or more distinct planes [\citep=Levin:03] [\citep=Genzel:03]. Multiple stellar disks have been observed in the nuclei of other galaxies at the resolution limited radii of [formula] (e.g., [\citealt=Pizzella:02]).

The proposal that stars form in the outer parts of accretion disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is not new [\citep=Kolykhalov:80]. The disks are susceptible to self-gravitating instability when the [\citet=Toomre:64] parameter Q = csΩ  /  πGΣ is less than unity, where cs is the sound speed, Ω = (GMbh / r3)1 / 2 is the angular velocity (assuming a Keplerian potential), Mbh is the mass of the MBH, and Σ is the surface density of gas. For a range of disk parameters, the disk fragments into stellar-size clumps. [\citet=Shlosman:89] discussed star formation in cold, molecular disks of AGN. Grains in the surface layer of a disk absorb the incident optical-to-soft X-ray flux from the AGN and reradiate it in the infrared. The disk bulk temperature remains low; e.g., if the [formula] black hole at the Galactic center were accreting at the Eddington rate during a past accretion episode, it would have heated the disk to temperatures ~  36r- 1 / 23, where r = 0.3r3 is the distance from the MBH. Such a cold disk is self-gravitating at surface densities [formula]. The apparent inevitability of fragmentation implies a crisis for the extended disk models ([\citealt=Goodman:03]).

While the construction of extended disk models may be challenging, nature offers evidence that these disks indeed exist. Maser emission in the rotational level transition [formula] of water has been detected at 22 GHz in the nuclei of several Seyfert II and LINER galaxies. Keplerian rotation patterns and disk-like geometries of the maser sources at distances [formula] from the MBH have been detected in (at least) three cases: NGC4258 [\citep=Miyoshi:95] [\citep=Greenhill:95], NGC1068 [\citep=Gallimore:96], and the Circinus galaxy [\citep=Greenhill:03a] [\citep=Greenhill:03b]. This has provided an accurate mass determination for the central black holes, as well as the distances to some host galaxies (e.g., [\citealt=Herrnstein:99]).

In Table [\ref=tab:params], we summarize the inferred values of the black hole mass Mbh, the radii of the masing sources from the MBH rdisk, and the stellar velocity dispersions σstellar of the host bulges. Note that in all cases the masers are located within the spheres of dynamical influence of the MBH rdisk < GMbh  /  σ2stellar, which reflects the selection of these sources for nearly-Keplerian rotation patterns.

The purpose of this Letter is to highlight a connection between the warm molecular disks in AGNs and the stellar populations at the Galactic Center. In § [\ref=sec:disk], we review the thermodynamical properties of a warm molecular disk by assuming that the conditions in this disk are uniformly conducive to the production of water maser emission. In § [\ref=sec:stars], we study the fragmentation of the disk and the formation of stars.

Conditions in the Disk from the Requirements for Maser Action

An inverted population of the maser levels, which is a precondition for maser action, requires a minimum gas temperature of 400 (e.g., [\citealt=Maloney:02] [\citealt=Watson:02]). Collisional pumping of the levels requires that the density of the masing gas be at least 107- 3. Above 1010- 3, the levels are thermalized, and the maser action is quenched. We assume that the conditions for the operation of masers are homogeneously represented in the disk, and we adopt the fiducial temperature Tgas = 400 and density ngas = 109- 3 at a distance rdisk  ~  0.3 from a central black hole of mass [formula]. We defer discussing the origin of the unexpectedly high temperature of the molecular gas to § [\ref=sec:discussion].

The assumption that the accretion disk has on average the same parameters as the masing regions is not essential; i.e., the masing regions could be localized condensations in the disk (§ [\ref=sec:discussion]). The star formation mechanism presented in § [\ref=sec:stars], however, is valid even at average temperatures of less than 400.

The vertical scale height of a disk in pressure equilibrium is H = cs  /  Ω  =  Σ  /  μmH2ngas, where the isothermal sound speed of gas with a mean molecular weight μ in units of the hydrogen molecular mass is related to the temperature via cs2 = kTgas  /  μmH2. The vertical column density of nuclei amounts to [formula], where [formula], Tgas = 400T4 and [formula].

Note that very similar column densities of 1025- 2 and [formula] have been inferred from hard X-ray absorption measures in the nuclei of NGC1068 [\citep=Matt:03] and the Circinus galaxy [\citep=Matt:99], respectively. This coincidence lends support to our characterization of the conditions in the disk. Detailed comparison, however, is not possible because the inclination and the corresponding absorbing column densities depend sensitively on the unknown degree of warping in the observed disks.

Formation of Stars in a Warm Molecular Disk

Since H / r  ~  0.003(T4r3  /  μM7)1 / 2, the disk is geometrically thin, and its gravitational stability can be determined by evaluating the Toomre parameter Q = 2.6n- 19r- 33M7. We find that Q drops below unity outside the critical radius of [formula]. The critical radii coincide, to within the uncertainty in ngas, with the radii of the observed maser disks.

Fragmentation of a marginally unstable disk produces gravitationally bound objects of the Jeans mass [formula]. The Jeans length is approximately equal to the disk thickness, which is in turn equal to the Hill (Roche) radius RH = (m* / 3Mbh)1 / 3r of a newly formed self-gravitating object of mass m* (hereafter a "protostar").

The total disk mass πr2diskΣ within the radius of the masers is [formula]. This mass is comparable to the conservative estimates of the mass of the circumnuclear disk (CND) at the Galactic center ([\citealt=Mezger:96] and references therein).

The maximum number of separate protostars that can be produced by the Jeans instability is then [formula], where f is the fraction of the disk mass that undergoes fragmentation. We expect that the latter fraction is well below unity, e.g., f  ~  0.1% - 1%. The density wakes associated with the Lindblad resonances of the protostars that formed first stimulate further fragmentation [\citep=Armitage:99] [\citep=Lufkin:03].

Gas interior to the Hill annulus [formula] in the disk is delivered by differential rotation into the protostar's Roche lobe and can accrete onto the star. The final mass of the protostar can thus be much larger than the Jeans mass. Equating the total mass in the annulus [formula] to the mass of the protostar m* and solving for the latter yield the maximum "isolation mass" [\citep=Lissauer:87] Miso  ~  (4 / 3π)M3 / 2disk / M1 / 2bh to which the star can grow by accreting the disk material. In gaseous protoplanetary disks, the growth of a planet terminates when a gap of width [formula] opens in the disk. In AGN disks, however, Miso is a large fraction of Mdisk [\citep=Goodman:04].

If multiple Jeans patches of the disk collapse simultaneously, their Hill annuli grow until they overlap. The accretion is terminated either by reaching the isolation mass or by the global depletion of gas from the accretion onto multiple protostars.

Before the protostellar mass has reached the terminal value, differential rotation in the disk delivers disk material into the Hill sphere of the protostar at the rate [formula], or

[formula]

If the protostar could accept mass at this rate, its growth time would be given by [formula].

The gas arriving into the Hill sphere undergoes a shock near the L1 and L2 Lagrangian points and forms two streams around the protostar [\citep=Lubow:99] [\citep=Bate:03]. The streams circularize at a fraction of ~  50% of RH from the protostar. The protostar is therefore fed from an accretion disk of its own. We have made an implicit assumption that the entire mass entering the Hill sphere on horseshoe orbits is inelastically captured and remains inside the sphere.

Gas in the protostellar disk must be able to dispense its angular momentum if it is to contract onto a central protostellar core. The radial extent of the protostellar disk is large, [formula], where R* is the radius of a star of mass m* on the ZAMS. In a purely gaseous disk, angular momentum extraction could be achieved via radial transport ("α-viscosity"; [\citealt=Shakura:73]) driven by the magnetorotational instability (MRI; [\citealt=Balbus:98]), via the magnetic breaking (MB) mechanism (e.g., [\citealt=Mouschovias:79]), or via the centrifugal launching of winds from the disk surface [\citep=Blandford:82].

MRI and MB are expected to operate in the outermost region of the protostellar disk if the concentration of free electrons in the gas is sufficiently large to provide for an inertial coupling with a magnetic field. This concentration depends on the detailed chemistry that we do not attempt to analyze here. We are thus not in the position to decide whether the outer edge of the protostellar disk is magnetically "dead" or "active." If it is dead, the material captured inside the Hill sphere accumulates in a violently unstable ring around the protostar. If it is active, it is, in principlem possible that a magnetically mediated angular momentum extraction maintains gravitational stability in the protostellar disk. For example, [\citet=Papaloizou:03] found evidence of MB while simulating the accretion onto planetary embryos embedded within a protostellar disk with ideal magneto-hydrodynamics (IMHD). We proceed to check for gravitational stability assuming, optimistically, that IMHD is realized in the protostellar disk.

If MRI is the dominant angular momentum extraction channel, and if the accretion rate is given by equation ([\ref=eq:protostaraccret]), the disk parameters can be evaluated in the standard fashion (e.g., [\citealt=Frank:02]). In the optically thick, adiabatic limit, we have α = 0.01α- 2 with α- 2  ~  0.1 - 1 (e.g., [\citealt=Sano:03]). The Rosseland mean opacity of molecular gas above 100 and below the opacity gap at [formula] is in the range κ  ~  2 - 102- 1 [\citep=Pollack:94] [\citep=Semenov:03]. Assuming that the outer radius of the disk is ~  RH, the Toomre parameter there equals Q*  ~  0.0075μ- 1.4α0.7- 2κ0.3M0.727r- 2.23m- 0.273n- 0.49T- 0.24. (All other parameters pertain to the parent, AGN disk medium.) The outer edges of an α-protostellar disk are thus gravitationally unstable in their own right.

If MB is the dominant angular momentum extraction channel, the angular momentum is removed in a vertical Alfvén crossing time of the disk, tmb  ~  φ- 1ρ- 1 / 2gas, where φ  ~  Bunif  /  Σ is the specific magnetic flux threading the gas in the donor AGN disk, ρgas is the ambient gas density (here assumed to equal the density of gas in the donor disk), and Bunif is the net magnetic field threading the disk. If Bunif is a fraction ξ of the equipartition field (4πρgas)1 / 2cs, then φ = 2ξΩ(π  /  ρgas)1 / 2. From mass and flux conservation in the flux-freezing approximation, we get that the column density in the protostellar disk Σ* is related to that in the AGN disk via Σ*  =  Σ  /  ξ. Thus, assuming a uniform gas temperature, the Toomre parameters of the two disks are related via Q*  =  ξQ. Since [formula] and ξ  ≪  1, we expect Q*  ≪  1. Again, the protostellar disk is gravitationally unstable.

We have found that the protostellar disk is susceptible to fragmentation in its own right and separates into multiple clumps. This process has recently been identified in simulations [\citep=Boss:02] [\citep=Nakamura:03] [\citep=Machida:03]. While the Hill sphere continues to receive gas at the rate given by equation ([\ref=eq:protostaraccret]), this gas does not accrete to a single protostar but to a group ([formula]) of protostars sharing the same Hill sphere. If [formula], the spatial extent of the group increases because of the strong two-body encounters ("dynamical evaporation") beyond the original Hill sphere. The evaporation takes place on a timescale of ~  Ω- 1Ngroup. The final group does not share the same Hill sphere even if the initial group did, and it is tidally stretched.

Evidence that stars form in compact groups can be found at the Galactic center. The IRS 13 complex is located at the projected distance of [formula] from Sgr A* and has an apparent diameter of less than 0.04. This compact stellar cluster contains seven blue supergiants. Recently, additional candidate members of this or a similar group have been discovered [\citep=Eckart:03]. Assuming an inclination of IRS 13 relative to Sgr A* of [formula] and an initial Hill radius of ~  0.01 pc, the spatial extent of IRS 13 would correspond to a Hill sphere associated with a total mass of [formula]. This is a fraction of the mass of the present CND and is compatible with the isolation mass limit for a [formula] disk that would form if the CND were to start accreting toward the MBH.

The stars forming in the disk possess initially quasi-circular orbits, yet several of the most bound stars, including S0-2, exhibit high eccentricities [formula]. While the disk torques are not effective at generating such high eccentricities, nearby encounters between stars could, in principle, scatter stars onto radial orbits. An encounter between stars initially belonging to disjoint Hill annuli induces a velocity change Δv  ~  (Gm / RH)1 / 2  ~  (m / Mbh)1 / 3rΩ, which is much too low to deflect the star by of order its own velocity, ~  rΩ, required for Δe  ~  1. Significantly larger velocity kicks result from three- or four-body gravitational slingshot interactions between binary stars sharing the same Hill sphere (massive stars in the field generically form in compact binaries; e.g., [\citealt=Vanbeveren:98]). Indeed, the circular velocity at S0-2's apoapse, ~  1300- 1, is comparable to the maximum velocity that a [formula] star can be deflected by, while avoiding direct collision with a similar star.

Discussion

So far, we have avoided explaining how the high temperature ([formula]) can be maintained in the maser disk. Dissipation of turbulence within the disk is not effective in this regard [\citep=Neufeld:95] [\citep=Desch:98]. To demonstrate this, we search for the (unrealistic) value of α that would be necessary to power the masing disk from within. The vertical optical depth equals [formula]. The accretion time [formula] is larger by [formula] than the dynamical time. Thus, the accretion rate [formula] may be very different at different radii [\citep=Gammie:99] and need not be related to the bolometric luminosity of the AGN. Instead, we assume that ngas and Tgas are independent variables and obtain [formula]. This requirement is orders of magnitude larger than the value typically found in numerical simulations. Therefore, the standard α-disks are not sufficiently warm to form masers.

Next, we check whether or not the protostellar radiative output could heat the disk. Part of the residual disk gas is accessible to the ionizing radiation from the new stars. Stars with ZAMS masses [formula] ionize the ambient hydrogen within [formula] from their initial collapse (e.g., [\citealt=Yorke:86]), and create regions within their parent disk. The characteristic region size is given by the Strömgren radius RS = (3F / 4πn2HαB)1 / 3, where F is the number of ionizing photons per unit time emitted by the star and [formula] is the case-B recombination coefficient of hydrogen [\citep=Osterbrock:89]. The ionizing photon number flux for a star with an effective temperature T* equals F  ≈  16π2kT*R2*ν20c- 2h- 1e- hν0 / kT*, where hν0 = 13.6. Taking the stellar luminosity [formula], where [formula] and stellar radius [formula], we get [formula].

The region is much smaller than the disk radius even if ~  99% of the disk gas has been depleted. The resulting distribution has a "blister" geometry typically found in the Orion Nebula and in other star-forming regions (SFRs). In SFRs, maser sources are found in the shocked, dense shell of the blister. The isotropic luminosities of the SFR masers, 10- 3 to [formula], are much smaller than those of the circumnuclear masers, 10 to [formula]. This may be the result of a longer gain path along coherent velocity patches in the AGN disk (where the gas flow is organized) rather than a larger pumping luminosity (e.g., [\citealt=Deguchi:89]).

The stars could also heat the disk gas mechanically, by driving spiral density waves that in some circumstances lead to spiral shocks. Such coherent, spiral shocks in the disk have been proposed as the sites of maser emission [\citep=Maoz:98]. This explanation, however, depends on many details of the model that we do not attempt to investigate here. The most promising mechanism for heating the disk gas may still be illumination by the X-ray flux of the AGN [\citep=Neufeld:94]. The X-rays heat a surface layer in the disk while allowing the midplane to remain cooler. If the average midplane temperature of the disk were, say, ~  5 times lower then the Jeans mass would have been, [formula]. The subsequent evolution described in § [\ref=sec:stars], including the rapid accretion of disk gas, the subfragmentation into multiple stars sharing the same Hill sphere, and the global depletion of disk gas, would occur in the same fashion.
