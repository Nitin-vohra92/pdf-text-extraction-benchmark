Introduction

We denote by X a complex smooth projective surface, and by f:X  →  C a fibration over a curve C whose generic fiber is a curve of genus g. f is called isotrivial if all smooth fibers are isomorphic to a fixed curve. f is called semistable if all of the singular fibers are reduced nodal curves. If there is no ( - 1)-curve contained in the fibers, then we call f relatively minimal. The projection X = F  ×  C  →  C is called a trivial fibration. s is always the number of singular fibers of f.

In a well-known paper [\cite=Be1], Beauville proved that a non-isotrivial fibration [formula] admits at least 3 singular fibers, and if f is semistable, then s  ≥  4. The first author proved in [\cite=Ta1] that if f is a semistable fibration of genus g  ≥  2, then it admits at least 5 singular fibers.

Beauville [\cite=Be2] gave a beautiful explicit classification of all semistable elliptic fibrations (g = 1) over [formula] with 4 singular fibers. More precisely, there are exactly 6 non-isotrivial such families, and all of them are modular families of elliptic curves. A very interesting natural problem is to classify semistable fibrations over [formula] of genus [formula] with 5 singular fibers. In the survey ([\cite=Vie], and Ex. 5.9), Viehweg considered this problem. The purpose of this note is to try to get some information on the structure of the surface X when f has 5 or 6 singular fibers. Our main results are the following two theorems.

Assume that [formula] is a non trivial semistable fibration of genus g  ≥  2 with s singular fibers. Assume also that f is relatively minimal. Then we have:

If s = 5, then X is birationally rational or ruled.

If s = 6 and g = 2, 3 or 4, then X is not of general type.

If s = 6, g = 5 and X is of general type, then the minimal model S of X satisfies

[formula]

The fibration f comes from a pencil on S with 5 simple base points (including infinitely near base points).

Thus if the Kodaira dimension of X is non negative, then s  ≥  6. We have no example of case (3), and we conjecture that s is at least 7 when X is of general type. We shall give two examples to show that the two bounds are sharp.

s = 6, g = 3, K2X =  - 4, and X is birationally a K3 surface.

s = 7, g = 4, K2X =  - 3, pg(X) = 2, q(X) = 0, and X is of general type containing 4 ( - 1)-curves.

Our next purpose is to give some inequalities for genus g  ≥  2 fibrations over [formula] (not necessarily semistable), which imply the lower bounds on s.

Let [formula] be a relatively minimal fibration of genus g  ≥  2, and let [formula] be its relative canonical divisor. Assume that f is not locally trivial. Then

[formula]

where S is the unique minimal model of X when κ(X)  ≥  0.

The bounds are optimal for infinitely many g. The example given in [\cite=Ta1] satisfies K2f = 4(g - 1), g = 2 and s = 5. The example A) above satisfies K2f = 6(g - 1), g = 3 and s = 6, where X is a K3 surface. In Theorem [\ref=Corollary_2], we will classify the fibrations [formula] with minimal K2f according to its Kodaira dimension.

The proof of Theorem [\ref=Theorem_I] is to use some inequalities, particularly the following strict canonical class inequality and its refinement for a non trivial semistable fibration f:X  →  C of genus g  ≥  2 with s  ≠  0 [\cite=Ta1] (see also [\cite=Liu] for a differential geometric proof):

[formula]

We use Reider's method to prove Theorem [\ref=Theorem_II]. Note that the strict canonical class inequality and the inequality K2f  ≥  6(g - 1) (resp. K2f  ≥  4(g - 1)) in Theorem [\ref=Theorem_II] imply that s  ≥  6 (resp. 5).

Preliminaries

Let f:X  →  C be a fibration of genus g  ≥  2, namely X (resp. C) is a nonsingular complex surface (resp. curve) and the generic fiber F of f is a nonsingular curve of genus g. We always assume that f is relatively minimal, i.e., there is no ( - 1)-curve contained in the fibers. f is called semistable if all of the singular fibers are reduced nodal curves. Denote by Kf = KX / C = KX - f*KC the relative canonical divisor of f, and by ωX / C its corresponding invertible sheaf. The relative invariants of f are defined as follows:

[formula]

These invariants are nonnegative, and K2f = 0 (equivalently, χf = 0) if and only if f is locally trivial. ef = 0 iff f is smooth. Let

[formula]

If Fi is semistable, then eFi is equal to the number of nodes of Fi.

Arakelov [\cite=Ara] and Beauville [\cite=Be3] proved that Kf is a nef divisor and the curves E with EKf = 0 are those ( - 2)-curves in the fibers. The map defined by |nKf| for large n is the contraction morphism σ:X  →  X# of the vertical ( - 2)-curves (cf. [\cite=Ta2]), we get the relative canonical model f#:X#  →  C of f.

In what follows, we assume that f:X  →  C is semistable with s singular fibers. Denote by q a singular point of X#. Then (X#,q) is a rational double point of type Aμq, here μq is the number of ( - 2)-curves in X over q. We also denote by q the singular point of the fibers on the smooth part of X#, in this case μq = 0. Then

[formula]

is the number of nodes in the singular fibers. For convenience, we let

[formula]

It is obvious that

[formula]

In [\cite=Ta1], we proved the strict canonical class inequality when s  ≠  0:

[formula]

The inequality follows from the following

[formula]

where e  ≥  2 is any integer (see [\cite=Ta1], p.594, (5)). Equivalently,

[formula]

Let [formula] be the points such that μqi  ≠  0. Let [formula] be the number of ( - 2)-curves contained in the fibers of f. Then

[formula]

Note that the number of points q such that μq = 0 is [formula]. Hence

[formula]

This completes the proof.

[formula], where ci is the number of components of Fi and [formula] is the normalization of Fi. So

[formula]

Let [formula] be the normalization of Fi, and Δ be the subscheme of the singular locus of Fi. Then we have

[formula]

Since Fi has only nodes as its singular points, we have eFi  =   deg Δ = h0(OΔ) = χ(OΔ). Thus

[formula]

This completes the proof.

Denote by [formula] the number of curves in the singular fibers different from ( - 2)-curves. Then we have

[formula]

This follows from ([\ref=2.3]) and ([\ref=2.4]).

If [formula], then

[formula]

By Cornalba-Harris-Xiao's inequality [\cite=CH] [\cite=Xi],

[formula]

we get

[formula]

Then from ([\ref=2.9]) and ([\ref=2.1]), we obtain

[formula]

it implies ([\ref=2.8]).

The proof of Theorem [\ref=Theorem_II]

In this section, we let [formula] be a relatively minimal fibration of genus g  ≥  2. If κ(X)  ≠    -    ∞  , we denote by S the unique minimal model of X.

Assume that f is not locally trivial. Then

[formula]

K2f = 4g - 4 if and only if X is the minimal resolution of the singularities of a double covering surface [formula] ramified over a curve of numerical type 2F1 + (2g + 2 - 4g(C))F2, and the fibration f is induced by the first projection [formula]. Here Fi is a fiber of the i-th projection of   [formula].

If κ(X) = 0, then K2f = 6g - 6 iff the fibration is induced by a pencil Λ  ⊂  |C| on its minimal model S with C2 = 2g - 2 simple base points (including infinitely near base points).

If κ(X) = 1, then K2f  =  6g - 5 iff the fibration is induced by a pencil Λ  ⊂  |C| of genus g on its minimal model S with C2 = 2g - 3 simple base points.

If κ(X) = 2, then K2S  ≥  1. [formula] iff  the fibration is induced by a pencil Λ  ⊂  |C| on S with only simple base points and C  ~  rKS. In particular, if g = 2, then K2f  ≥  8, with equality iff K2S = 1 and C  ~  KS. If g = 3, then K2f  ≥  15.

(1) Let A = KX + F. We claim that |2A| (resp. |3A|) is base point free if g  ≥  3 (resp. g = 2). In particular, A is nef and hence

[formula]

Indeed, by Ramanujan's vanishing theorem ([\cite=BPV], p.131), H1( - F) = H0( - F) = 0. So

[formula]

Hence we can assume that A is an effective divisor. Since AF = 2g - 2  ≥  2, A admits at least one horizontal component. Hence AKf  ≥  1.

Note that |2A| = |KX + Kf|. If g  ≥  3, K2f = AKf + 2(g - 1)  ≥  1 + 4 = 5. Suppose |2A| has a base point p, by Reider's theorem [\cite=Rei], there is a curve E passing through p such that

(i)  KfE = 0 and E2 =  - 1;   or   (ii)  KfE = 1 and E2 = 0. On the other hand, [formula]. Thus the two cases can not exist. This proves that |2A| has no base point.

Now we consider the case g = 2. We first prove that A is nef.

Suppose Γ is an irreducible and reduced curve with AΓ < 0. It is easy to see that Γ must be a horizontal curve. Hence (A + F)Γ = KfΓ  ≥  1. Then we have ΓF  ≥  2. On the other hand, |A| is non empty, so Γ is the fixed part of |A|. Hence 2 = 2g - 2 = AF  ≥  ΓF  ≥  2. We get ΓF = 2, and A = Γ + E, where E consists of vertical curves. It implies that Γ2 = AΓ - EΓ < 0. Since AΓ = KXΓ + 2 < 0, we have KXΓ  ≤   - 3. So pa(Γ) < 0, impossible. Therefore, A is nef and A2  ≥  0.

In this case, |3A| = |KX + 2A + F|. L = 2A + F is nef and L2 = 4A2 + 4AF  ≥  8(g - 1) > 4. If |3A| has a base point p, then there is a curve E passing through p such that

(i)  LE = 0, E2 =  - 1;   or   (ii) LE = 1, E2 = 0. Since A and F are nef, (i) implies AE = FE = 0. Note that A = KX + F, we have KXE = 0 and [formula], a contradiction. So case (i) is impossible. In case (ii), we have AE = 0 and FE = 1, so KXE =  - 1 which is also impossible since E2 = 0. This proves that |3A| is base point free.

Now we consider the case when K2f = 4g - 4, i.e., A2 = 0.

In this case, the base point free linear system |6A| is composed with a fibration φ:X  →  C over a smooth curve C . Denote by F' a generic fiber of φ. Then AF' = 0. Since AF = 2g - 2  ≥  2, F' can not be the fiber of f. So FF'  ≥  1. From AF' = 0, we get KXF' =  - FF'  ≤   - 1. Since F'2 = 0, we have KXF' =  - 2 and FF' = 2. So [formula]. Now we get a generally double cover [formula] defined by π(x) = (f(x),φ(x)). Since the pullback π*F2 of a generic fiber F2 is still isomorphic to [formula], and a generic π*F1 has genus g. By Hurwitz formula, we see that the branch curve Bπ of π has numerical type 2F1 + (2g + 2 - 4g(C))F2.

Conversely, if the branch curve Bπ has numerical type 2F1 + (2g + 2 - 4g(C))F2, then Bπ is nonsingular or admits at most ADE singularities. Thus the canonical resolution is the minimal one, and the fibration induced is relatively minimal. By easy computations ([\cite=BPV], p.183, or [\cite=Hor]), we have K2X =  - 4(g - 1) and hence K2f = 4g - 4. This completes the proof of (1).

(2) Suppose that the Kodaira dimension of X is non negative, and let S be the unique minimal model of X obtained by contracting ( - 1)-curves. So the fibers F of f are contracted to a pencil Λ in |C| on S with base points [formula] (including infinitely near base points). We consider a generic curve C in Λ, and let ni be the multiplicity of C at pi. Then ni  ≥  1. Note that F2 = 0, KXF = 2g - 2. One can prove easily that Since S is neither ruled nor rational, KS is nef and K2S  ≥  0. Hence KSC  ≥  0. Thus [formula].

[formula]

Hence K2f  ≥  6g - 6. If K2f = 6g - 6, i.e., K2X =  - (2g - 2) < 0, then KSC = 0, K2S = 0 and ni = 1 for any i. In particular, m = K2S - K2X = 2g - 2 > 0 and C2 > 0. By Hodge index theorem, KS is numerically trivial, thus κ(X) = 0. By ([\ref=1.1]), C2 = m = 2g - 2. This completes the proof of (2).

(3) We have proved that if κ(X)  ≥  0 and K2f = 6g - 6, then κ(X) = 0. So if κ(X) = 1, we obtain K2f  ≥  6g - 5 and K2S = 0. Suppose K2f = 6g - 5, i.e., K2X =  - (2g - 3) < 0, then m = 2g - 3 > 0 and C2 > 0. As in the proof of (2), KSC  ≠  0 (otherwise, by Hodge index theorem, KS  ~  0 and κ(X) = 0). So KSC  ≥  1. From our assumption K2f = 6g - 5 and (2.3), we get KSC = 1. Now ([\ref=1.2]) implies that ni = 1 for any i, hence C2 = 2g - 3 and C is smooth. The fibration is induced by a pencil in |C| with 2g - 3 simple base points.

(4) In the case when κ(X) = 2, we let x = CKS, y = C2. Then

[formula]

It is easy to prove that

[formula]

Now from ([\ref=1.3]), we have

[formula]

If the equality holds, then the equalities in ([\ref=1.4]) hold. We obtain easily the desired characterization.

Let [formula] be a relatively minimal semistable fibration of genus g  ≥  2 with s singular fibers. If f is non trivial and s = 5, then X is birationally ruled or rational.

By the strict canonical class inequality, we have K2f < 6g - 6. The corollary follows from Theorem [\ref=Corollary_2].

Note that if s = 5, then S is either [formula] or a geometrically ruled surface. So

[formula]

The proof of Theorem [\ref=Theorem_I] for s = 6

In this section, we assume that [formula] is semistable and s = 6. We use freely the notations in the previous sections, including those in the proof. Denote by [formula] the 6 singular fibers.

We recall the inequalities in Sect. 1 for our f: where [formula], and [formula] is the number of non ( - 2)-curves in the 6 singular fibers.

In what follows, we assume that X is of general type, thus K2S  ≥  1. Denote respectively by [formula] the image curves of [formula]. By (A),

[formula]

We see that KSC  ≠  1. Otherwise, by Hodge index theorem, K2SC2  ≤  (KSC)2 = 1, so C2  ≤  1, which implies m  ≤  1. Hence

[formula]

If g  ≤  4, then X is not of general type.

We shall rule out the cases g = 2,3 and 4 under the assumption κ(X) = 2.

Case  g = 2: ([\ref=2.7]) implies m = 0, which contradicts ([\ref=2.6]).

Case  g = 3:  By ([\ref=1.2]), ([\ref=2.6]) and ([\ref=2.7]), m = KSC = 2, K2S = 1, K2X =  - 1, n1 = n2 = 1, hence C2 = 2. By Noether inequality K2S  ≥  2pg(S) - 4 and Debarre's inequality [\cite=Deb] K2S  ≥  2pg(S)  ≥  2q(S) if q(S)  ≥  1, we obtain

[formula]

Note that

[formula]

On the other hand, from (B) for e = 12, we get rf  ≥  48. This contradicts ([\ref=2.9]): rf  ≤  ef.

Case  g = 4:  (D) for e = 12 implies that K2X  ≤   - 8 / 5. Thus K2X  ≤   - 2 and m  ≥  3. By ([\ref=2.7]), we see that m  ≤  4.

If m = 3, then K2S = 1 and K2X =  - 2, we see that ([\ref=2.10]) holds. As in ([\ref=2.11]), we obtain ef  ≤  50. ([\ref=2.2]) for e = 9 implies that rf  ≥  54, which contradicts rf  ≤  ef.

If m = 4, then ([\ref=1.2]) and ([\ref=2.7]) imply that KSC = 2, [formula], and C2  =  4. By Hodge index theorem, we can see that K2S = 1 and K2SC2 = (KSC)2. Hence C  ~  2KS. This means that any ( - 2)-curve E on S does not pass through any one of the 4 base points [formula] because CE = 2KSE = 0. Hence ( - 2)-curves in Ci must be ( - 2)-curves in Fi.

Note that KSCi = 2, so Ci has at most two components different from ( - 2)-curves. This implies that Fi has at most two components which are neither ( - 2)-curves nor the exceptional curves of the 4 base points.

On the other hand, among the 4 exceptional curves on X, at least one of them is a horizontal ( - 1)-curve. If the remaining three exceptional curves are vertical, then at least one of them is a ( - 2)-curve. Hence the total number [formula] of non ( - 2)-curves in the 6 singular fibers ≤  6  ×  2 + 2 = 14.

Now by (C), rf  ≤  32. On the other hand, (B) for e = 6 implies that rf  ≥  36, a contradiction.

If s = 6, g = 5 and X is of general type, then the minimal model S of X satisfies

[formula]

The fibration comes from a pencil on S with 5 simple base points.

In this case, (D) for e = 10 implies that [formula] thus K2X  ≤   - 3 and m  ≥  4. On the other hand, m  ≤  2g - 2 - 2 = 6. If m = 6, then C2  ≥  6 and KSC  ≤  2, by Hodge index theorem, K2SC2  ≤  (KSC)2  ≤  4, and hence K2S  ≤  0, a contradiction. Thus m = 4 or 5.

If m = 4, then K2S = 1, K2X =  - 3, pg(S)  ≤  2, q(S) = 0, C2  ≥  4, and KSC  ≤  4. Thus

[formula]

From ([\ref=2.2]) for e = 8, we have

[formula]

It contradicts ([\ref=2.9]).

So m = 5. By ([\ref=1.1]) and ([\ref=1.2]), we have C2  ≥  5, KSC  ≤  3. From ([\ref=2.7]), we get KSC  ≥  2. Since K2S  ≥  1, by Hodge index theorem, K2SC2  ≤  (KSC)2, we have KSC = 3 and K2S = 1. So K2X =  - 4, pg  ≤  2 and q = 0. By ([\ref=1.1]) and ([\ref=1.2]), we obtain [formula] and C2 = 5. Generic C in the pencil is smooth. Let e = 6. Then (B) gives us that [formula].

Now we prove that pg = 2. Otherwise pg  ≤  1, by ([\ref=2.11]), ef  ≤  12(1 + 1) - ( - 4) + 16 = 44 < rf, a contradiction. Then we have

[formula]

So [formula], [formula].

Let mi  =    #  {  q  |  μq = i  }. Then

[formula]

We see that ef - m0  ≥  4(rf - m0), hence m0  ≥  46. If m0 = 46, one can prove that m1 = 5 and mi = 0 for i > 1. So there are at least 46 points q such that μq = 0, and there are at most (56 - 46) / 2 = 5 points q with μq  ≠  0. By ([\ref=2.3]) we get

[formula]

It implies that r  ≤  5 and [formula].

Two examples

Note that for any two points p1,p2 on [formula], there exists a cyclic cover [formula] ramified exactly over p1 and p2. For example, [formula] defined by x  ↦  xn is totally ramified over 0 and ∞  . Now we are going to construct some covers of [formula].

Let [formula] be the double cover ramified over 1 and ∞  , and let [formula] be the cyclic cover of degree e totally ramified over the two points π- 1(0). Then the composition

[formula]

is a covering of degree 2e ramified uniformly over 0,1,  ∞  . The map φ2e is the quotient map of [formula] for the standard action of the diedral group of order 2e on [formula]. The cover has two ramification points over 0 with ramification index e, and e ramification points over 1 (resp. ∞  ) with index 2. Now we consider the fiber product of [formula] and [formula], we get a curve

[formula]

This curve is of type (2e,n). The first projection [formula] can be viewed as the pullback of φ2e under the base change τn. So the set Σ of critical points of p1 is τ- 1n{0,1,  ∞  }. Σ contains n + 2 points. In fact, Γ is locally defined by φ2e(y) = τn(x). Thus we can see that Γ admits two singular points defined by ye = xn over τ- 1n(0) and e singular points of type y2 = xn over τ- 1n(  ∞  ). p1 has e simple ramification points over each point of τ- 1n(1).

[formula]

Let e = n = 4. Then Γ is of type (8,4). Let X be the minimal resolution of the double cover [formula] ramified over Γ. X can be obtained by the canonical resolution [formula], where σ is the blowing-up of [formula] at the two singular points of Γ over τ- 1n(0). Denote by E1 and E2 the two exceptional curves, and by [formula] the strict transform of Γ on Y. Then [formula], where   =  σ*((4,2)) - 2E1 - 2E2. Let :X̄  →  Y be the double cover ramified over [formula]. Note that [formula] admits only ADE singularities, so X̄ admits at most rational double points, and X is the minimal resolution of X̄. Now by the formulas ([\cite=BPV], p.183), we have

[formula]

Denote by C1 and C2 the two horizontal sections of [formula] passing through the two points blown up by σ, and by i their strict transforms on Y. Since 1 and 2 are disjoint with [formula], it is easy to see that their pullback on X̄ are 4 ( - 1)-curves. Note that

[formula]

so KX̄  =  *(1  +  2) is the sum of the 4 ( - 1)-curves. Let S be the surfaces obtained by contracting the 4 horizontal ( - 1)-curves. Then we see that [formula]. By easy computation, we have

[formula]

So S is a K3 surface. The first projection of [formula] induces a semistable fibration [formula] of genus 3 with n + 2 = 6 singular fibers. Because K2X =  - 4, K2f = 12 = 6g - 6.

Similarly, let e = n = 5, and let F∞ be the vertical fiber of [formula] passing through the two singular points of type x5 = y5. Then consider the double cover of [formula] ramified over F∞  +  Γ. The canonical resolution is similar to the above case. We have [formula] and

[formula]

where [formula] is the strict transform of F∞ on Y. The pullback of ∞  +  1  +  2 on X̄ consists 5 ( - 1)-curves, the one from ∞ is a vertical ( - 1)-curve. After blowing-down this vertical ( - 1)-curve, we get a relatively minimal semistable fibration [formula] of genus g = 4 with n + 2 = 7 singular fibers. We see easily that |KS| is a genus 2 pencil with one simple base point. The pencil is in fact induced by pr2. So X is of general type. By easy computation, we have χ(OS) = 3, hence

[formula]

In this case, K2X =  - 3 and K2f = 6g - 3.
