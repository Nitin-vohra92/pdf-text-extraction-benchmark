Abstract. For an N-partite quantum system we show that separability implies inequalities on Bell correlations which are stronger than the local reality inequalities by a factor 2(N - 1) / 2.

1. : Striking features of quantum entanglement were brought into sharp focus by the landmark papers of Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen and Schrödinger1. The Bohm-Aharonov version of the EPR paradox with two spin half particles in a singlet state led to Bell's theorem2 that quantum theory violates 'local realism'. Subsequently other entangled states, e.g. Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger3 (GHZ) state of four spin [formula] particles and its N-particle generalizations led to optimal local reality inequalities derived by Mermin4 (for odd N) and Roy and Singh5 (all N) and others6. The Mermin-Roy-Singh (MRS) inequalities are violated by suitable entangled or non-separable states by a factor 2(N - 1) / 2. This is now recognised to be the maximal violation possible, due to Cirel'son's theorem7 for N = 2, and recent work of Werner and Wolf8 for general N.

The physical origins of the ideas of local realism and quantum separability are very different. The exponential violation of local realism by suitable entangled states is therefore an extremely interesting but indirect consequence of entanglement. The current explosive interest in applications of quantum entanglement to quantum information theory9 prompts us to seek direct qualitative and quantitative signatures of quantum entanglement. Here we present separability inequalities on Bell correlations which are exponentially stronger than local reality inequalities for large N. We show that for N-partite systems there are entangled states violating separability by a factor 2(N - 1). It is natural to conjecture that this exponential violation of separability, being a quantitative measure of quantum parallelism, is intimately connected to the exponential speed-ups achievable in quantum computation10.

2. : Consider a composite system which breaks up into N components. The kth component is measured with apparatus specified by a set of parameters ak to determine the value of a variable A(k)(ak) which by its very definition must lie between νk and μk,

[formula]

Repeated simultaneous measurements of A(k)(ak) yield their correlation function as the expectation value 〈A(a)〉, where

and [formula]. A Bell correlation function 〈B〉 is a linear combination of such correlation functions, with the Bell variable B defined by

[formula]

where c(a) are real numbers.

According to Bell's formulation of Einstein locality or local realism, if all pairs made out of the N sub-systems are mutually spacelike separated, then in a 'Local Hidden Variable' theory,

[formula]

where 'λ' are hidden variables which determine the outcomes A(k)(λ,ak) in individual runs, and ρ(λ) their probability distribution. Local reality means that for each λ the outcome A(k)(λ,ak) is independent of all other orientations [formula] and outcomes [formula] for [formula] observed at spacelike separation.

On the other hand in quantum theory each A(k)(ak) becomes a self-adjoint operator in a Hilbert space H(k) with eigenvalues in the interval
