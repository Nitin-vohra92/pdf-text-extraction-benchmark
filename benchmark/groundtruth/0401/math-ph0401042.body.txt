Erratum : Existence of   3D   Skyrmions. Complete version.

Introduction

The Skyrme's problem consists in minimizing an energy functional together with a condition, which is of topological type (see the papers in the reference list for information on the physical meaning of this problem). The functional space consists of functions mapping   I R3   into   S3. In [\cite=E1] an existence result was proved for Skyrmions in   3D   by using the concentration-compactness method. Then, in [\cite=E2] the same result was proved in another functional context, but using the same technical arguments. But as Fanghua Lin and Yisong Yang have pointed out to me, the proof of the main result contained in [\cite=E1] [\cite=E2] is not correct. In this Erratum a new proof is made by changing the arguments used in [\cite=E1] [\cite=E2]. The method used here is still the concentration-compactness principle but applied in a different, and in some sense, less usual way.

In a very interesting paper basically devoted to the study of the Faddeev knots ([\cite=LY1]), F. Lin and Y. Yang prove the existence of   3D   Skyrmions of degree [formula] by using a different approach, which is based on a cubic decomposition of the whole space. In that paper, they obtain a condition for the existence of solutions for the   3D   Skyrme's problem given by a family of strict decomposition inequalities. After communicating their paper to me, I realized that my previous proof contained some gaps and I tried to correct it in the same spirit of concentration-compactness that I had used from the beginning. By doing this, I reach the same condition for the existence of minimizers. This is not surprising. Indeed, the above family of strict inequalities is not only sufficient for the existence of minimizers, but is in fact necessary and sufficient for the relative compactness of all minimizing sequences, so it is not so surprising that by different approaches we reach the same condition.

One of the main problems in the proofs in [\cite=E1] [\cite=E2] is a cutoff lemma allowing to approach a Skyrme's finite energy function by a function which is constant near infinity. Or separating into two distinct finite energy functions one which is "almost constant" in a large annulus-like domain. And the possibility of doing this in 3D is still open. In another excellent paper, [\cite=LY2] F. Lin and Y. Yang show that this can be done in dimension 2, which is a very nice result. So, after they prove this, they can obtain the existence of   2D   Skyrmions by "more classical" concentration-compactness arguments. In   2D   the arguments are somehow different due to the presence of a "new" term in the energy functional.

Here I prove again the main existence result in [\cite=E1] [\cite=E2] and the proof is self-contained. In order to write a short erratum I quote some auxiliary results which are proved in [\cite=E1] [\cite=E2] [\cite=E3] and then, wholly prove the main theorem.

Let me note again that the way to tackle the possible losses of compactness of minimizing sequences is not exactly the same in this paper and in that of Lin and Yang, even if in the end we reach the same condition for existence of Skyrmions, and hence the same theorem.

Main theorem and auxiliary results.

For all functions   φ:I R3  →  S3   which are of class   C1   and constant outside a ball of   I R3   we can define a notion of topological degree, which is an integer and which can be represented by the expression

[formula]

In [\cite=E3] we proved that this notion of topological degree can be extended to all functions   φ:I R3  →  S3   such that [formula] and [formula] (i,j∈{1,2,3}) belong to   L2(I R3,S3), this degree still being an integer.

If we denote by [formula] (i,j = 1,2,3), then the Skyrme's problem consists in minimizing the energy

[formula]

over the functions   φ∈X: = {φ:I R3  →  S3  ;  E(φ) <  +   ∞  }   which have a given degree   d(φ) = k   and we denote this minimum by   Ik. The minimizers are called Skyrmions. Note that the case of degree 0 is trivial, since then the minimizers are just the constant functions and   I0 = 0. So, in what follows we only address the case   k  ≠  0.

Here we prove the following

Let   k  ≠  0. If for all finite integer decompositions of   k  , [formula], [formula],

[formula]

then, Ik is achieved.

Note that in [\cite=E1] [\cite=E2] only binary decompositions (J = 2) had to be avoided. The difference lies in the fact that we do not know anymore whether for all [formula], the large inequalities [formula] hold or not.

Moreover, as in [\cite=E0], we have

For all integer   k  ,

[formula]

Hence, from Theorem [\ref=T1] and the above Proposition we obtain

The two infima   I±  1   are achieved, that is, there exist minimizing Skyrmions with degree [formula].

Proof of main results.

Proof of Proposition [\ref=estimate]. The first inequality in ([\ref=estt]) follows easily from Schwartz and Hölder inequalities: For all   φ∈X,

[formula]

[formula]

On the other hand, if we consider the stereographic projection from   S3   into   I R3, its inverse   φ̃   belongs to   X   and its energy can be computed easily and it is equal to [formula] (see [\cite=E0]). Moreover,   φ̃   can be approximated by functions   φ̃n∈X which are constant outside a big ball and such that

[formula]

One can "link"   k   copies (maybe conveniently rotated) of those   φ̃n's to construct a map of degree   k   with energy as close to [formula] as desired. [formula]

In order to prove our main result, let us begin by noting that by the Poincaré-Wirtinger inequality, it is easy to see that there is a constant   C > 0   such that for all φ∈X, up to a rotation,

[formula]

where P is the north pole of the sphere S3 (see [\cite=E1], Lemma 7). Note that the problem is invariant by rotation and translation.

Two important auxiliary results for the proof of Theorem [\ref=T1] are the following propositions.

([\cite=E1]) For any   φ∈X, for any   B  ⊂  I R3   measurable,

[formula]

The proof of this proposition can be found in [\cite=E1].

Let   φ∈X. Then, P being the north pole of   S3,

[formula]

Proof. Let   φ∈D(I R3,I R)4   and   φ∈X. Then,

[formula]

[formula]

where in this identity     <    ·  ,  ·    >     stands for the duality product between   D1,2   and its dual, and

[formula]

Now let   {ρε}ε  ⊂  D(I R3)   a regularizing sequence such that if for   φ∈X, we define [formula], we have [formula] in   L2(I R3). As a consequence,   P(φε)   converges towards   P(φ)   in the distributional sense as ε goes to 0. On the other hand, an easy computation shows that for every ε > 0,   P(φε) = 0. Hence, the distribution   P(φ)   is the null distribution and therefore the term [formula] in the r.h.s. of ([\ref=luze]) is equal to 0.

Now, take a sequence   {φn}n   in   D(I R3,I R)4  , bounded in W1,  ∞(I R3,I R)4   and such that   φn   converges towards P a.e. as n goes to +    ∞  . Then, the proposition is proved by writting ([\ref=luze]) for   φ  =  φn   and passing to the limit in n with the help of Lebesgue's Theorem. [formula]

We can start now the

Proof of Theorem [\ref=T1]. Let   {φn}   be a minimizing sequence for   Ik. We define

[formula]

Up to subsequences we may assume that [formula], A∈(Ik,  +    ∞  ).

By ([\ref=pw]),   {fn}n   is a bounded sequence of nonnegative functions in   L1(I R3). Hence, we can apply to it the first concentration-compactness Lemma of P.-L. Lions [\cite=PLL1], which states that up to extraction of subsequences, either

(vanishing) for all R > 0, [formula] or

(dichotomy) there exist a sequence   {yn}n   in   I R3   and numbers   a1,b1 > 0   such that   a1 + b1 = A   and for all ε > 0 there exist   R > 0   and a sequence of positive numbers   {Rn}n   such that   Rn  →  n  +    ∞   and

[formula]

and   a1   is the maximal number satisfying this property, or

(compactness) there exists a sequence   {yn}n   in   I R3   such that for all ε > 0 there exists   R > 0   with

[formula]

To deal with the possibility of vanishing we prove the following

Let   {Dn}n   be a sequence of measurable subsets of   I R3  . If there is vanishing for the sequence   {fn  1  IDn}, then for   n   large enough,

[formula]

Proof. Let us define

[formula]

Since the sequence   {φn}   is uniformy bounded in   L∞   and since in three dimensions W1,1(B(y,1)) is embedded in [formula], the embedding constant being independent of   y, then for all   α∈(1,3 / 2) and for all   y∈I R3,

[formula]

C being independent of n and of   y. Considering now a locally finite covering of   I R3,   {B(yi,1)}i  ≥  1   such that every point of   I R3   is at most in   m   of those balls, we have

[formula]

Hence, choosing   α = 7 / 6   we get    lim n  →    +    ∞||φn - P||L7(Dn) = 0. Now define

[formula]

with   γ > 0   such that [formula].

By Proposition [\ref=3/4] and the hypothesis of vanishing, we can find   C' > 0 independent of n and of ε such that

[formula]

while for n large enough, ([\ref=van]) implies that [formula]. Hence, the result. [formula]

Lemma [\ref=vanish] applied with   Dn  =  I R3   forbids vanishing for any minimizing sequence of   Ik   as soon as   k  ≠  0. Indeed, use Proposition [\ref=degre0] to infer that

[formula]

If the third alternative (compactness) of the concentration-compactness happened, then up to subsequences, there exists   φ∈X such that

[formula]

weakly in   L2(I R3,S3)  ×  L2(I R3,S3)  ×  L1(I R3,S3)   as n tends to     +    ∞  . Indeed, the convergence of the two first sequences is trivial. As for the last one, note that Proposition [\ref=3/4] makes that sequence locally equi-integrable. On the other hand, the compactness assumption ensures that this sequence is uniformly equi-integrable at infinity. So, up to subsequences, the sequence [formula] is weakly compact in   L1(I R3,S3). Finally, the particular form of the limits comes from the fact that   A(φ)   and [formula] are null lagrangians, and hence, they pass to the limit in the weak sense (see the detailed proof in [\cite=E2]).

Now, the same kind of arguments show that up to subsequences, [formula] is relatively compact in   L1(I R3,S3)-weak. Moreover, from ([\ref=convg]) it follows immediately that

[formula]

Hence, up to subsequences,

[formula]

and so   d(φ) = k   and by lower semicontinuity of the functional   E  , φ   is a minimizer for   Ik.

Suppose now that dichotomy holds and fix ε small. Let us denote   yn   by   y1n,   R   by   R1   and   Rn   by R1n. Let 1 be the weak limit of [formula] in D1,2(I R3) (up to extraction of a subsequence).   1∈X and we denote its degree by d1. By using the same arguments as those used in the case of compactness, we easily see that up to subsequences,

[formula]

Now, either   d1 = k or   d1  ≠  k. If the former happens, then   1   would be a minimizer for   Ik. Indeed,   E(1)  ≤   lim inf nE(φn).

If on the contrary   d1  ≠  k, let us apply again the concentration-compactness procedure to the sequence [formula], defined as [formula]. We can do it, even if the sequence is not defined in the whole space.

To start with, there cannot be vanishing for the sequence [formula]. Indeed, if this were the case,   d(φn)   would be equal to   d1   for n large enough : if we define [formula],

[formula]

and by Lemma [\ref=vanish], vanishing for the sequence   {f2n}   would imply that [formula] is as small as desired for n large. On the other hand, for ε > 0 given, let us choose Kε > R such that

[formula]

Here R stands for the R appearing in the definition of dichotomy. Note that we have used Proposition [\ref=degre0] to write ([\ref=degfi]).

By choosing n large enough such that   Kε < R1n, the dichotomy hypothesis on the sequence   {f1n}   and   1's definition imply that

[formula]

[formula]

Then, taking ε small and n large, we prove   d(φn) = d1, a contradiction. So, if d1  ≠  k, we must again have either compactness or dichotomy for the restricted sequence [formula] .

Now, as above we find [formula], R2, a2 > 0 , b2  ≥  0 and R2n going to infinity, such that for n large,

[formula]

and

[formula]

where a2 + b2  =  b1.

Define 2 as the weak limit of [formula] in D1,2(I R3). We can prove as before that

[formula]

We can iterate this process for every j  ≥  2 and find [formula], Rj, aj,  bj  ≥  0 and Rjn going to     +    ∞   such that for n large,

[formula]

and

[formula]

where aj  +  bj  =  bj - 1.

Note that by the definition of dichotomy, the sequence   {aj}j   is nonincreasing. Moreover, for all [formula], [formula]. Therefore,   aj   tends to 0 as j tends to     +    ∞  . Note also that for all   j  ≥  2,

[formula]

Applying Lemma [\ref=vanish] with the choice [formula], we infer that for   j   and   n   large enough,

[formula]

Let us denote by J the smallest j such that ([\ref=JJ]) holds true.

Putting all together we find that

[formula]

with    lim ε  →  0cε = 0, dn < 1 / 2 for n large. Since all the dj's are integers, this means that

[formula]

On the other hand, up to subsequences,

[formula]

[formula]

Hence, since   {φn}   is a minimizing sequence for   Ik, we obtain

[formula]

with

[formula]

Therefore, if ([\ref=ineq]) holds, dichotomy and vanishing cannot arise and   Ik   is attained.[formula]
