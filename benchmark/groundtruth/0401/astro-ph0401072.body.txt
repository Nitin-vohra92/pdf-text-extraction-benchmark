An updated nuclear reaction network for BBN.

Early Universe is a (hot) plasma in a FLRW metric whose composition and properties depend on the �cosmic� temperature T and that cools during universe expansion. The main events of its evolution depend on the freezing of some interaction during the cosmic expansion. BBN takes place when nuclear reactions (keeping baryons in chemical equilibrium) freeze-out, thus producing a characteristic pattern in light nuclide abundances.

BBN plays a fundamental role in Cosmology, where it can be used to check the internal consistence of the Standard Cosmological Model (SCM); in Astrophysics, e.g. to study the Li depletion mechanism in halo PopII stars, PopIII chemical composition or the Galactic Chemical Evolution; or to get a hint of New-Physics, because BBN is sensitive to the existence of other relativistic degrees of freedom (parameterized in Neff), to ν's asymmetries, etc.

In its minimal formulation, BBN is an overconstrained theory: all the relevant observables depend on the only unknown parameter [formula], where nb and nγ are respectively the baryon and the photon number densities. The other parameters are Standard-Physics inputs, and the greatest uncertainties in standard BBN predictions arise from nuclear reaction rates Rk.

These rates are obtained as thermal averages of the relevant cross-sections σ. From a theoretical point of view, it is very difficult to use a first principle approach (strong interactions, many body problems, etc.), so one makes recourse to nuclear models. Moreover, experimental difficulties are present due to the low counting rates, strong energy dependence and corrections for electron screening. To obtain low energy extrapolations, fit the data and/or the theoretical predictions, it is useful to introduce some meaningful parameterizations, as the so-called astrophysical S factor. In a completely general approach, the error matrix (due to nuclear uncertainties) for the nuclide abundances is given by the quantities:

[formula]

with δR±k the (temperature dependent) upper and lower uncertainties on Rk, respectively; R represents the collection of the nuclear reaction rates and θ the collection of the other relevant cosmological parameters (i.e. [formula]). This slightly differs from the approach in [\cite=flsv] which assumes the existence (in principle not necessary) of the linear functionals λik  =  ∂ log Xi(θ)  /  ∂ log Rk. To properly define these quantities, the symmetric, temperature independent, relative uncertainties δRk / Rk are needed. The analysis performed in [\cite=mythesis] (see also [\cite=bbnwmap] [\cite=bbninp]) is restricted to a reduced network including the reactions relevant for the abundances of the nuclides with A  ≤  7. More than 80 reactions were examined, and many of the main reaction rates have been updated. Particularly useful tools in this work were furnished by the NACRE compilation [\cite=nacre], the LUNA measurement [\cite=luna], or some recent theoretical predictions (e.g. [\cite=rupak], for the key reaction p + n  →  γ  +  2H). Moreover, in the new code the nuclear partition functions were introduced to include the role of excited states for nuclides whose mass number A  ≥  6 [\cite=mythesis] [\cite=nacre], and new reactions were added (as the 3He  +  3H  ↔  γ  +  6Li, see [\cite=mythesis] [\cite=bbnwmap] [\cite=bbninp]). The negligible role of plasma screening effects and of new three-body reactions was also confirmed [\cite=mythesis] [\cite=bbninp]. In the recent paper [\cite=bbnwmap], some applications of this new code were performed: we (mainly) checked the internal consistence of the SCM (sections 4 and 5) and evaluated the BBN constraints on some New-Physics scenarios (section 7): e.g., we showed that in the Degenerate-BBN scenario a fourth sterile neutrino, as for example required to interpret LSND evidence for [formula] oscillation, is not yet ruled out.
