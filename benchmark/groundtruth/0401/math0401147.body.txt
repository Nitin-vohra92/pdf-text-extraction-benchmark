Invariant multidimensional matrices

In [\cite=AO] the authors study Steiner bundles via their unstable hyperplanes and proved that (see [\cite=AO], Tmm 5.9) : A rank n Steiner bundle on [formula] which is [formula] invariant is a Schwarzenberger bundle. In this note we give a very short proof of this result based on Clebsch-Gordon problem for [formula]-modules.

Introduction

Let A, B, and C three vector spaces over [formula] and [formula] a linear surjective map. We consider the sheaf Sφ on [formula] defined by,

[formula]

with fibers [formula].

Remark 1. If [formula] then  ker(φ) meets the set of decomposable tensors, so there exist a∈A , a  ≠  0 and b∈B, b  ≠  0 such that [formula].

Remark 2. When Sφ is a vector bundle it gives two "associated" Steiner bundles SA on [formula] and SB on [formula] after projections (see [\cite=DK], prop. 3.20).

We denote by [formula] the variety of hyperplanes tangent to the Segre [formula] and by [formula] the set of hyperplanes in [formula] containing [formula].

The next proposition is a reformulation of many results from, [\cite=GKZ] (see for instance Thm 3.1' page 458, prop 1.1 page 445), [\cite=AO] (see thm page 1) and [\cite=DO] (see cor.3.3). Remark 3. When [formula] the variety [formula] is an hypersurface in [formula]. This hypersurface is defined by the vanishing of the hyperdeterminant, say Det(Φ) where Φ is the generic tridimensional matrix (see [\cite=GKZ], chapter 1 and 14).

Proof. It is clear that 1) 2) and 3) are equivalent. It remains to show that 3) and 4) are equivalent too. Since ∂(abc) = (∂(a))bc + a(∂(b))c + ab(∂(c)) an hyperplane H is tangent to the Segre in a point (a,b,c) if and only if it contains [formula] and [formula] and [formula]. We prove here that the third condition implies the two others. Let H an hyperplane containing [formula], we show that there exists c∈C such that H contains [formula] and [formula]. Let φ the trilinear application corresponding to H. Since [formula] we have a [formula]-dimensional family of bilinear forms vanishing on (a,b). Now finding a bilinear form of the above family (i.e. finding c∈C) which verify [formula] and [formula] imposes at most n + m conditions. Since [formula], this point c exists. [formula]

Invariant tridimensional matrix under [formula]-action

In the second part of this note we will consider the boundary case

[formula]

Then, instead of writing φ induces a vector bundle or [formula] we will write equivalently Det(φ)  ≠  0.

We denote by Si the irreducible [formula]-representations of degree i and by [formula] a basis of Si. Proof. When [formula] is just the multiplication [formula] it is well known that it corresponds to Schwarzenberger bundles (see [\cite=DK], prop 6.3).

Conversely, let [formula], [formula] where Ui, Vj are trivial [formula]-representations of dimension ni and mj. Let xi∈Si, xj∈Sj be two highest weight vectors and u∈Ui, v∈Vj. Since Det(φ)  ≠  0, [formula] and by [formula]-invariance [formula]. By hypothesis [formula] for all u∈Ui and v∈Vj so, by the Remark 1, it implies that  dim Wi + j  ≥  ni + mj - 1, and Sni + mj - 1i + j  ⊂  C*.

Assume now that B contains at least two distinct irreducible representations. Let i0 and j0 the greatest integers in I and J. We consider the submodule B1 such that [formula]. Then the restricted map [formula] is not surjective because the image is concentrated in the submodule C*1 of C* defined by [formula]. Now since

[formula]

there exist a∈A, b∈B1  ⊂  B such that [formula]. A contradiction with the hypothesis Det(φ)  ≠  0.

So A = Snii, B = Smjj and Sni + mj - 1i + j  ⊂  C*. Since [formula], we have [formula] which is possible if and only if ni = mj = 1 and C = Si + j.  [formula] Proof. Let S a rank n Steiner bundle on [formula], i.e S appears in an exact sequence

[formula]

where [formula], [formula] and [formula]. If [formula] acts on S the vector spaces A, B and C are [formula]-modules since A is the basis, B* = H1S( - 1) and C* = H0(S*). If S is [formula]-invariant the linear surjective map

[formula]

is [formula]-invariant too. [formula]

Remark. The proofs of the theorem and the proposition, given in this paper, are still valid for more than three vector spaces when the format is the boundary format.
