Carleson measures and Logvinenko-Sereda sets on compact manifolds

Introduction and statement of the results

Let (M,g) be a smooth, connected, compact Riemannian manifold without boundary of dimension m  ≥  2. Let dV be the volume element of M associated to the metric gij. Let ΔM be the Laplacian on M associated to the metric gij. It is given in local coordinates by

[formula]

where |g| = det(gij) and (gij)ij is the inverse matrix of (gij)ij. Since M is compact, gij and all its derivatives are bounded and we assume that the metric g is non-singular at each point of M. Since M is compact, the spectrum of the Laplacian is discrete and there is a sequence of eigenvalues

[formula]

and an orthonormal basis φi of smooth real eigenfunctions of the Laplacian i.e. ΔMφi =  - λiφi. So L2(M) decomposes into an orthogonal direct sum of eigenfunctions of the Laplacian. We consider the following spaces of L2(M).

[formula]

where L  ≥  1 and kL  =   dim EL. EL is the space of L2(M) generated by eigenfunctions of eigenvalues λ  ≤  L. Thus in EL we consider functions in L2(M) with a restriction on the support of its Fourier transform. It is, in a sense, a Paley-Wiener type space on M with bandwidth L. The motivation of this paper is to show that the spaces EL behave like the space defined in [formula] (d > 1) of spherical harmonics of degree less than [formula]. In fact, the space EL is a generalization of the spherical harmonics and the role of them are played by the eigenfunctions. The cases M = S1 and [formula] (d > 1) have been studied in [\cite=OrtSal] and [\cite=Mar], respectively.

This similarity between eigenfunctions of the Laplacian and polynomials is not new, for instance, Donnelly and Fefferman in [\cite=DF], showed that on a compact manifold, an eigenfunction of eigenvalue λ behaves essentially like a polynomial of degree [formula]. In this direction they proved the following local L∞ Bernstein inequality. The proof of the above estimate is rather delicate. Donnelly and Fefferman conjectured that it is possible to replace λ(m + 2) / 4 by [formula] in the inequality. If the conjecture holds, we have in particular, a global Bernstein type inequality:

[formula]

In fact, this weaker estimate holds and a proof will be given later. This fact suggests that the right metric to study the space EL should be rescaled by a factor [formula] because in balls of radius [formula], a bounded eigenfunction of eigenvalue λ oscillates very little. In the present work we will study for which measures [formula] one has

[formula]

with constants independent of f and L.

We will also study the inequality

[formula]

that defines the Carleson measures and we will present a geometric characterization of them. Inequality [\eqref=aimtostudy] will be studied only for the special case dμL  =  χALdV, where [formula] is a sequence of sets in the manifold. In such case, when [\eqref=aimtostudy] holds , we say that A is a sequence of Logvinenko-Sereda sets. Our two main results are the following:

Let [formula] be a sequence of measures on M. Then μ is L2-Carleson for M if and only if there exists a C > 0 such that for all L

[formula]

The sequence of sets [formula] is Logvinenko-Sereda if and only if there is an r > 0 such that

[formula]

In what follows, when we write that [formula], [formula] or A  ≈  B we mean that there are constants depending only on the manifold such that A  ≤  CB, A  ≥  CB or C1B  ≤  A  ≤  C2B, respectively. Also, the value of the constants appearing during a proof may change but they will be still denoted with the same letter. We will denote by B(ξ,r) a geodesic ball in M of center ξ and radius r and [formula] will denote an Euclidean ball in [formula] of center z and radius r. The structure of the paper is the following: in the first section, we will explain the asymptotics of the reproducing kernel of the space EL. In the second section, we shall discuss one of the tools used: the harmonic extension of functions in the space EL. Following this, we will study the Carleson measures associated to M and we will prove Theorem [\ref=thmCM]. In the last section, Theorem [\ref=thmLS] will be proved. Acknowledgment.

The reproducing kernel of EL

Let

[formula]

This function is the reproducing kernel of the space EL, i.e.

[formula]

Note that [formula] The function KL is also called the spectral function associated to the Laplacian. Hörmander in [\cite=Horm], proved the following estimates.

KL(z,w) = O(L(m - 1) / 2),  z  ≠  w.

[formula] (uniformly in z∈M), where σm = 2πm / 2 / (mΓ(m / 2)).

[formula].

In fact, in [\cite=Horm], there are estimates for the spectral function associated to any elliptic operator of order n  ≥  1 with constants depending only on the manifold. So, for L big enough we have kL  ≈  Lm / 2 and

[formula]

with constants independent of L and z.

Harmonic extension

In what follows, given f∈EL, we will note by h the harmonic extension of f in [formula]. The metric that we consider in N is the product metric, i.e. if we denote it by ij for [formula] then

[formula]

Using this matrix, we can calculate the gradient and the Laplacian for N. If h(z,t) is a function defined on N then

[formula]

and

[formula]

Note that [formula]. Let f∈EL, we know that

[formula]

Define for (z,t)∈N

[formula]

Observe that h(z,0) = f(z). Moreover [formula]

The function h is harmonic in N because {

[formula]

For the harmonic extension, we don't have the mean-value property, because it is not true for all manifolds (only for the harmonic manifolds, see [\cite=Willmore] for a complete characterization of them). What is always true is a "submean value property" (with a uniform constant) for positive subharmonic functions, see for example [\cite=SchYau]). Observe that since h is harmonic on N, |h|2 is a positive subharmonic function on N. In fact, |h|p is subharmonic for all p  ≥  1 (for a proof see [\cite=GreWu]). Therefore, we know that for all r < R0(M)

[formula]

where R0(M) > 0 is the injectivity radius of M and [formula]. In particular,

[formula]

where Ir = Ir(0). The following result relates the L2  -  norm of f and h.

Let r > 0 fixed. If f∈EL then

[formula]

Therefore, for r < R0(M)

[formula]

with constants depending only on the manifold M.

Using the orthogonality of [formula] we have

[formula]

Similarly, one can prove the left hand side inequality of [\eqref=desnormhandf].

We recall now a result proved by Schoen and Yau that estimates the gradient of harmonic functions.

For a proof see [\cite=SchYau].

We will use Schoen and Yau's estimate in the following context. Take [formula]. Observe that Ricc(N) = Ricc(M) which is bounded below because M is compact. Note that N is complete because it is a product of two complete manifolds. We will take [formula] (r < R0(M)) and [formula] (note that this is not the ball of center (z,0)∈N and radius [formula], but it contains and it is contained in such ball of comparable radius).

Using Schoen and Yau's theorem, we deduce the global Bernstein inequality for a single eigenfunction.

If u is an eigenfunction of eigenvalue λ, then

[formula]

The harmonic extension of u is [formula]. Applying inequality [\eqref=SchYauestimate] to h (taking [formula]),

[formula]

We conjecture that in inequality [\eqref=Bernsteinineqeigenfunction], one can replace u by the functions f∈EL, i.e.

[formula]

For instance, as a direct consequence of Green's formula, we have the L2  -  Bernstein inequality for the space EL:

[formula]

For our purpose, it is sufficient a weaker Bernstein type inequality that compares the L∞ norm of the gradient with the L2 norm of the function.

Let f∈EL. Then there exists a universal constant C such that

[formula]

For the proof, we need the following lemma.

For all f∈EL and 0 < r < R0(M) / 2,

[formula]

Using inequality [\eqref=SchYauestimate] and the submean-value inequality for |h|2, we have

[formula]

where  = 2r.

Using Lemma [\ref=gradestimate], given 0 < r < R0(M) / 2 there exists a constant Cr such that

[formula]

Taking r = R0(M) / 4, we get that [formula] for all z∈M.

Characterization of Carleson measures

Let μ be a sequence of measures on M. Then, μ is L2  -  Carleson for M if and only if there exists a C > 0 such that for all L

[formula]

Condition [\eqref=condCarlmeas] can be viewed as

[formula]

First, we prove the following result.

Let μ be a sequence of measures on M. Then, the following conditions are equivalent.

There exists a constant C = C(M) > 0 such that for each L

[formula]

There exist c = c(M) > 0 (c < 1 small) and C = C(M) > 0 such that for all L

[formula]

Obviously, the first condition implies the second one since

[formula]

Let's see the converse. The manifold M is covered by the union of balls of center ξ∈M and radius [formula]. Taking into account the 5-r covering lemma (see [\cite=Matt] for more details), we get a family of disjoint balls, denoted by [formula], such that M is covered by the union of 5Bi. This union may be finite or countable. Let ξ∈M and consider [formula]. Let n be the number of balls [formula] such that [formula]. Since [formula] is compact, we have a finite number of these balls, so that

[formula]

We claim that n is independent of L. Hence we will get our statement because

[formula]

We only need to check that n is independent of L. Using the triangle inequality, for all [formula]

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

where the union is a disjoint union of balls. Now,

[formula]

Hence, [formula] and we can choose it independently of L.

Now we can prove the characterization of the Carleson measures.

Assume condition [\eqref=condCarlmeas]. We need to prove the existence of a constant C > 0 (independent of L) such that for each f∈EL

[formula]

Let f∈EL with L and r > 0 (small) fixed.

[formula]

with constants independent of L. Therefore, [formula] is L2  -  Carleson for M. For the converse, assume that μ is L2  -  Carleson for M. We have to show the existence of a constant C such that for all L  ≥  1 and ξ∈M, [formula] (for some small constant c > 0). We will argue by contradiction, i.e. assume that for all [formula] there exists Ln and a ball Bn of radius [formula] such that μLn(Bn) > n / kLn  ≈  n / Lm / 2n (c will be chosen later). Let bn be the center of the ball Bn. Define Fn(w) = KLn(bn,w). Note that the function L- m / 4nFn∈ELn and [formula]. Therefore,

[formula]

Now we will study this infimum. Let [formula]. Then

[formula]

[formula]

We pick c small enough so that

[formula]

Finally, we have shown that [formula] [formula]. This gives us the contradiction.

The following result is a Plancherel-Pólya type theorem but in the context of the Paley-Wiener spaces EL.

Let Z be a triangular family of points in M, i.e. [formula]. Then Z is a finite union of uniformly separated families, if and only if there exists a constant C > 0 such that for all L  ≥  1 and fL∈EL

[formula]

The above result is interesting because the inequality [\eqref=PlancherelPolya] means that the sequence of normalized reproducing kernels is a Bessel sequence for EL, i.e.

[formula]

where [formula] are the normalized reproducing kernels. Note that |L(  ·  ,zLj)|2  ≈  |KL(  ·  ,zLj)|2k- 1L. That's the reason why the quantity kL appears in the inequality [\eqref=PlancherelPolya].

This is a consequence of Theorem [\ref=charactseqCarlmeas] applied to the measures

[formula]

Characterization of Logvinenko-Sereda Sets

Before we state the characterization, we would like to recall some history of these kind of inequalities. The classical Logvinenko-Sereda (L-S) theorem describes some equivalent norms for functions in the Paley-Wiener space PWpΩ. The precise statements is the following:

Let Ω be a bounded set and 1  ≤  p <  +   ∞  . A set [formula] satisfies

[formula]

if and only if there is a cube [formula] such that

[formula]

One can find the original proof in [\cite=LS] and another proof can be found in [\cite=HJ]. Luecking in [\cite=Lueck] studied this notion for the Bergman spaces. Following his ideas, in [\cite=MarOrt], it has been proved the following result.

Let 1  ≤  p <  +   ∞  , μ be a doubling measure and let [formula] be a sequence of sets in [formula]. Then E is Lp(μ) - L-S if and only if E is μ  -  relatively dense.

For the precise definitions and notations see [\cite=MarOrt]. Using the same ideas, we will prove the above theorem for the case of our arbitrary compact manifold M and the measure given by the volume element. In what follows, [formula] will be a sequence of sets in M.

It is equivalent to have this property for all L  ≥  L0 for some L0 fixed.

Our main statement is the following:

A is L-S if and only if A is relatively dense.

We shall prove the two implications in the statement separately. First we will show that this condition is necessary. Before proceeding, we construct functions in EL with a desired decay of its L2-integral outside a ball.

Given ξ∈M and ε > 0, there exist functions fL = fL,ξ∈EL and R0 = R0(ε,M) > 0 such that

[formula].

[formula]

For all L  ≥  1 and any subset A  ⊂  M,

[formula]

where C1 is a constant independent of L, ξ and fL.

Remark. In the above Proposition, the R0 does not depend on the point ξ.

Given z,ξ∈M and L  ≥  1, let SNL(z,ξ) denote the Riesz kernel of index [formula] associated to the Laplacian, i.e

[formula]

Note that S0L(z,ξ) = KL(z,ξ). The Riesz kernel satisfies the following inequality.

[formula]

This estimate has its origins in Hörmander's article [\cite=HormRiesz]. Estimate [\eqref=RieszKernelEstimate] can be found also in [\cite=Sogge]. Note that on the diagonal, SNL(z,z)  ≈  CNLm / 2. The upper bound is trivial by the definition and the lower bound follows from

[formula]

Similarly we observe that [formula]. Given ξ∈M, define for all L  ≥  1

[formula]

We will choose the order N later. Each fL belongs to the space EL and has unit L2-norm. Let us verify the second property claimed in Proposition [\ref=construcfunctions]. Fix a radius R. Using the estimate [\eqref=RieszKernelEstimate],

[formula]

For any t  ≥  0, consider the following set.

[formula]

Note that for t > R- 2(N + 1), [formula] and for t < R- 2(N + 1), [formula]. Using the distribution function, we have:

[formula]

provided N + 1 > m / 2. Thus if we pick R0 big enough we get

[formula]

Now the third property claimed in Proposition [\ref=construcfunctions] follows from [\eqref=L2decay]. Indeed, given any subset A in the manifold M,

[formula]

Observe that

[formula]

Now we are ready to prove one of the implications in the characterization of the L-S sets.

Assume A is L-S. Then it is relatively dense.

Assume A is L-S, i.e.

[formula]

Let ξ∈M be an arbitrary point. Fix ε > 0 and consider the R0 and the functions fL∈EL given by Proposition [\ref=construcfunctions]. Using the third property of Proposition [\ref=construcfunctions] for the sets AL, we get for all L  ≥  1,

[formula]

where C1 is a constant independent of L, ξ and fL. Therefore, we have proved that there exist constants c1 and c2 such that

[formula]

Hence, A is relatively dense provided ε > 0 is small enough.

Before we continue, we will prove a result concerning the uniform limit of harmonic functions with respect to some metric.

Let [formula] be a family of uniformly bounded real functions defined on the ball [formula] for some ρ > 0. Let g be a non-singular C∞ metric such that g and all its derivatives are uniformly bounded and gij(0) = δij. Define gn(z) = g(z / Ln) (the rescaled metrics) where Ln is a sequence of values tending to ∞   as n increases. Assume that the family [formula] converges uniformly on compact subsets of [formula] to a limit function [formula] and Hn is harmonic with respect to the metric gn (i.e. ΔgnHn = 0). Then, the limit function H is harmonic in the Euclidean sense.

Let [formula]. We have

[formula]

It is a direct computation to see that Δgnφ  →  Δφ uniformly and Δgnφ is uniformly bounded on [formula]. Then

[formula]

Therefore, the limit function H is harmonic in the weak sense. Applying Weyl's lemma, H is harmonic in the Euclidean sense.

The above argument also holds if we have a sequence of metrics gn converging uniformly to g whose derivatives also converge uniformly to the derivatives of g. In this case, the conclusion would be that the limit is harmonic with respect to the limit metric g.

Now, we shall prove the sufficient condition of the main result.

If A is relatively dense then it is L-S.

Fix ε > 0 and r > 0. Let D: = Dε,r,fL be

[formula]

The norm of fL is almost concentrated on D because

[formula]

It is enough to prove

[formula]

with constants independent of L and for this, it is sufficient to show that there exists a constant C > 0 such that for all w∈D

[formula]

Because then, [\eqref=aimLSestimateonA] follows by integrating [\eqref=aimLSnormonA] over D. So we need to prove [\eqref=aimLSnormonA]. Assume it is not true. This means that for all [formula] there exists Ln, functions fn∈ELn and wn∈Dn = Dε,r,fn such that

[formula]

By the compactness of M, there exists ρ0  =  ρ0(M) > 0 such that for all w∈M, the exponential map, [formula], is a diffeomorphism and (B(w,ρ0), exp - 1w) is a normal coordinate chart, where w is mapped to 0 and the metric g verifies gij(0) = δij. For all [formula], take [formula] which is defined in [formula] and act as follows:

[formula]

Consider [formula] and the corresponding harmonic extension hn of fn. Set

[formula]

defined on [formula] (where J1 = ( - 1,1)). Let μn be the measure such that [formula]. Note that

[formula]

Therefore, we have

[formula]

We will normalize Hn so that

[formula]

As wn∈Dn, we have

[formula]

[formula]

Since |hn|2 is subharmonic,

[formula]

Hence, we have [formula]. Using the assumption,

[formula]

where Bn is such that [formula]. So we have that

[formula]

In fact, [formula] (by the definition) and one can prove that [formula]. Indeed, if [formula], let [formula] and [formula]. Then

[formula]

Therefore, working with 1 / 2 instead of 1 we have [formula] for all n. The sequence [formula] is equicontinuous in [formula]. Indeed, consider [formula] and [formula], then there exists some small δ > 0 such that

[formula]

Taking [formula] small enough so that δ  ≤  r / 4 and using Schoen and Yau's estimate [\eqref=SchYauestimate], we have

[formula]

So we have proved that |hn(w,t) - hn(w̃,t̃)|  ≤  C. Take [formula] small enough so that C  <  ε. Let [formula] and [formula]. Consider w =  exp n(z), [formula], w̃  =   exp n() and [formula]. We have proved that for all ε > 0 there exists  > 0 (small) such that for all [formula]:

[formula]

Change 1 / 4 by 1. So the sequence Hn is equicontinuous. Hence the family [formula] is equicontinuous and uniformly bounded on [formula]. Therefore, by Ascoli-Arzela's theorem there exists a partial sequence (denoted as the sequence itself) such that Hn  →  H uniformly on compact subsets of [formula]. Since Fn(z) = Hn(z,0), we get a function [formula] which is the limit of Fn (uniformly on compact subsets of [formula]). By hypothesis, the sequence [formula] is relatively dense. Taking into account that [formula], we get that

[formula]

where we have denoted [formula] by Bn. Let τn be such that dτn  =  χBndμn. From a standard argument (τn are supported in a ball), we know the existence of a weak *-limit of a subsequence of τn, denoted by τ. This subsequence will be noted as the sequence itself. Using [\eqref=hypothreldense], we know that τ is not identically 0. Now we have that

[formula]

Therefore, F = 0 τ  -  a.e. in [formula]. Now for all [formula] compact

[formula]

therefore F = 0 in suppτ. Let [formula] such that [formula], then using the fact [formula],

[formula]

Therefore [formula] for all n. Hence, in the limit [formula]. In short,

We have sets [formula] such that

[formula]

We have measures τn weakly-* converging to τ (not identically 0).

[formula] for all [formula].

|F| = 0 τ-a.e. in [formula].

|F(0)| > 0 and [formula].

Assume we know that H is real analytic, then F(z) is real analytic. Federer ([\cite=Fed]) proved that the (m - 1) - Hausdorff measure Hm - 1(F- 1(0)) <   ∞  . Hence [formula]. This implies that the Hausdorff dimension [formula]. On the other hand, since [formula], we have

[formula]

and this implies that [formula] by Frostman's lemma. So we reach to a contradiction and the proof is complete. We only need to check that H is real analytic. In fact, we will show that H is harmonic. We have the following properties:

Observe that the family of measure dμn converges uniformly to the ordinary Euclidean measure because [formula], where w0 is the limit point of some subsequence of wn (recall that we are taking normal coordinate charts).

If [formula] (i.e. gn is the rescaled metric), then Δ(gn,Id)Hn(z,s) = 0 for all [formula], by construction.

The functions Hn are uniformly bounded and converge uniformly on compact subsets of [formula].

We are in the hypothesis of Lemma [\ref=uniformlimit] that guarantees the harmonicity of H in the Euclidean sense. This concludes the proof of the proposition.
