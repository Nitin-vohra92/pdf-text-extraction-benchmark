Lambda-conductors for group rings

Introduction.

This paper is part of a project which aims to provide a method for computing the Nil groups of the group rings of finite abelian groups, by refining some of the techniques used in [\cite=ads] and [\cite=ados] in such a way that the allowed coefficient rings include polynomial rings. For the refinement of the p-adic logarithm discussed in [\cite=flog] and [\cite=fexp] it is assumed that the rings involved have a structure of λ-ring; we refer to these papers for generalities about λ-rings. Thus it is useful to extend as much as possible of the other techniques to the context of λ-rings. In this paper we investigate how to describe a group ring of a finite abelian group as a pull back of a diagram of rings which are more accessible to calculations in algebraic K-theory.

Let be given a commutative ring S and subring R. For each ideal I of S which is contained in R one has a cartesian square thus describing R as a pull back of rings for which the K-theory is hopefully better understood. By taking for I the sum of all such ideals one finds a diagram where the rings on the bottom row are as small as possible.

We modify this construction by assuming that R has a structure of λ-ring and considering only ideals I stable under the λ-operations. We call the resulting ideal the λ-conductor of S into R. In particular we are interested in the case that R is the group ring [formula] of a finite abelian group, and S is its normal closure in [formula], which splits as a direct sum of rings [formula] associated to equivalence classes of characters [formula].

In this situation R is a λ-ring such that ψn(g) = gn for every [formula] and g∈G. In general S is not stable under the λ-operations on [formula], but it is stable under the associated Adams operations ψn since they are ring homomorphisms.

We will prove that in case G is a primary group its λ-conductor is precisely the intersection of the classical conductor and the augmentation ideal. We do this by exhibiting generators of the classical conductor and examining their behavior under the fundamental λ-operations.

The primary case

Throughout this section G is a group of order n = pe, where p is prime. We consider representations [formula]. We say that ρ is of level k if the image of ρ has pk elements.

Two representations τ1 and τ2 are called equivalent if they have the same kernel. That means that there must be some [formula] prime to p such that τ2(x) = τ1(x)m for all x∈G. Obviously equivalent representations have the same level.

Given a representation τ of level k > 0 one gets a representation ψτ of level k - 1 by the formula (ψτ)(x) = τ(xp) for x∈G. If ψτ1 and ψτ2 are equivalent then we may replace τ2 by an equivalent representation τ'2 so that ψτ'2  =  ψτ1. So we may choose a representation in each class in such a way that ψτ and ρ coincide if they are equivalent.

Let ρ be a representation of level k > 0 and write ω  =   exp (2πi / p). We define an element [formula] by the formula If we choose yρ∈G such that ρ(y) = ω then we get The only representation of level 0 is the trivial representation, which we denote by 1, and it gives rise to [formula].

If ρ and τ are not equivalent then bρbτ = 0. Furthermore [formula] for ρ of level k > 0.

If [formula] we may assume that there is g∈G with ρ(g) = 1 but τ(g) = ω. If g has order m then [formula] and thus bρ is a multiple of [formula], whereas bτ is a multiple of 1 - g . The product of these two factors is 0.

The second part follows from [formula] which is true because each ξ gives the same contribution and there are pe - k of them.

Every representation ρ of level k gives rise to a homomorphism jρ from [formula] to [formula], where ωk  =   exp (2πi / pk).

If ρ and τ are not equivalent then jρ(bτ) = 0. Furthermore j1(b1) = pe, and [formula] if ρ is of level k > 0,.

The second part is obvious since every x in the definition of bρ maps to 1, and yρ maps to ω. The first part follows since jρ(bρ)jρ(bτ) = 0 by Proposition [\ref=bortho] and Sρ is a domain.

It is well known that the maps jρ (one from each equivalence class) combine to an embedding from R into its integral closure [formula].

The bρ generate the conductor ideal I of S into R.

By the theorem of Jacobinski (Theorem 27.8 in [\cite=curt]) the conductor is [formula], where D- 1ρ is the lattice in [formula] dual to [formula] under the trace form. It is a simple exercise that this fractional ideal is in fact generated by p- k(1 - ω), which means that nD- 1ρ is just j(bρ)S = j(Bρ)Sρ = j(bρR).

We remind the reader that in particular nS is contained in the conductor.

The λ-conductor Iλ from S into R is defined as the largest ideal of S contained in R which is stable under the fundamental λ-operations [formula]. It is of course a subset of the largest ideal of S contained in R, which is the ordinary conductor I described above. Thus we have to investigate the behaviour of the operations [formula] on the generators bρ.

If ρ is of level k > 0 and there is no τ with ψτ  =  ρ then ψpbρ = 0.

Write G as a direct product of cyclic groups, with generators gi. If the order of ρ(gi) is strictly smaller than the order of gi for all i then one can find a suitable τ by taking for each τ(gi) a p-th root of ρ(gi). If however the orders are the same for some i then there is certainly some h∈G such that hp = 1 and ρ(h) = ω. By definition of bρ we have Here the term in the second sum associated to η = hξ cancels the term in the first sum associated to ξ.

If ρ is of level k > 0 then

By definition we have We claim that all terms with [formula] cancel. To prove this assume that the class of x in G / Gp is nontrivial. Then there exists a homomorphism [formula] such that σ(x) = ω. Now the term associated to τ in the first sum equals the term associated to τ' = τ  ·  σ in the second sum.

So we only have to consider terms of the form x = ξp with ξ∈G. The condition τ(x) = 1 is then independent of τ (since it is equivalent to ρ(ξ) = 1) and the sum over all τ with ψτ  =  ρ reduces to a multiplication with the number of equivalence classes of such τ. By the Lemma we may assume that this number is nonzero. Now τ1 and τ2 with ψτ1  =  ρ  =  ψτ2 are equivalent iff τ2  =  τ1 + mpk1 for some m with 0  ≤  m < p. So this number is 1 / p times the number of homomorphisms [formula], hence equals pr - 1, where r denotes the rank of G.

On the other hand we have Here the first sum is a certain factor times the sum over all x∈G for which there exists ξ∈G with x = ξp and which satisfy τ(x) = 1 for any (and thus all) τ with ψτ  =  ρ. The factor is the number of ξ which satisfy these conditions, which equals pr.

We write h for the polynomial of degree p - 2 given by

We have and thus We must take the sum of [formula] over all equivalence classes of [formula] with ψτ = 1. Interchange the sum over x and the sum over τ. There are two cases:

If x∈Gp then τx = 1 for all τ, and we must simply count the number of equivalence class of τ. There are pr - 1 of them, with p - 1 in each class.

If [formula] then the number of τ such that τx = 1 is pr - 1 - 1, with again p - 1 in each class.

So we get

Now we consider the effect of Adams operations ψq for primes [formula]. For any prime q we write fq and gq for the polynomials given by

If ρ is of level k > 0 then and ψq(b1) = b1.

We have [formula] and

For the idempotents eρ∈Sρ one has

Since R has no [formula]-torsion the Adams operations [formula] determine the operations [formula] and we find

If ρ has level k > 0 then Moreover

This is just a matter of combining the last three Propositions with the formula [formula]. Note that k = e can only happen if G is cyclic, in which case ypρ = 1, which implies that bpρ = (1 - yρ)p = p(1 - yρ)gp(yρ).

The bρ with [formula] generate the λ-conductor ideal Iλ. In other words Iλ is the intersection of the augmentation ideal and the ordinary conductor ideal I.

Write J for the R-ideal generated by the bρ with [formula]. From Proposition [\ref=thetab] one reads of that [formula] for [formula] and for every prim [formula]. From the identity it then follows that [formula] for [formula] and all [formula]. Finally from it follows that [formula] for every [formula]. Since J  ⊂  I by Proposition [\ref=conduc] this shows that J  ⊂  Iλ.

Suppose that x∈Iλ and [formula]. Then x∈I, so by Proposition [\ref=conduc] there are xρ∈R such that [formula]. Since [formula] by the first half of the proof, it follows that x1b1∈Iλ. Since gb1 = b1 for every g∈G we may assume that [formula]. Moreover [formula] which means that its p-valuation vp(x1) is a natural number. We may assume that x is chosen in such a way that vp(x1) is minimal. Now Iλ must also contain However the valuation of the coefficient of b1 is vp(xp1pe(p - 1) - x1) - 1 = vp(x1) - 1, in contradiction with the way x was chosen. Thus Iλ  ⊂  J.

Direct products of relatively prime order

Let G1 be a group of order n1 = pe, and let G2 a group of order n2 = qf, where p and q are different primes. We write [formula] and [formula], and denote their normal closures by S1 and S2 respectively. Finally we write I1 for the conductor of S1 into R1 and I2 for the conductor of S2 into R2. Since the Si are free abelian groups, the same is true for the other additive groups involved, and we can view [formula] as a subgroup of [formula] and of [formula].

There are [formula] such that m1n1 + m2n2 = 1. If x is an element of the left hand side then [formula], so [formula] and therefore [formula]. Similarly [formula] and thus [formula]. The other implication is obvious

The conductor I of [formula] into [formula] is [formula].

Suppose that x∈I, so that [formula]. We write [formula] as [formula], where g runs trough G2. For any a∈S1 we have [formula]. Therefore xga∈I1 for any a∈S1, which means that ag∈I1 for all g∈G1. Thus [formula]. Similarly [formula]. Thus [formula] by the Lemma. The other inclusion is obvious.

We show now that for the λ-conductor a similar theorem holds:

The λ-conductor Iλ of [formula] into [formula] is the tensor product of the λ-conductors I1λ of S1 into R1 and I2λ of S2 into R2.

The λ-conductor Iλ is a subset of the classical conductor I , which is [formula]. However I1 is the direct sum [formula] by theorem [\ref=primconduc]. and similarly for I2. Thus any x∈Iλ can uniquely be written as with [formula], x1∈I1λ, x2∈I2λ, [formula]. Since Iλ is an ideal of [formula], each of these four summands must be in Iλ.

Therefore we consider the intersection of Iλ with [formula]. Suppose that a is an element of this intersection, say [formula] with x∈I2λ. Then θp(a)∈Iλ too. We have and thus [formula] should be in Iλ. Now the first term is a multiple of a and thus in Iλ. So the other term [formula] is in the aforementioned intersection. Since ψp is an automorphism (of finite order) of R2 this shows that the intersection is p-divisible. Since the intersection is a finitely generated abelian group this can only happen if it vanishes.

The same argument applies to the first and second summand of x. Thus [formula] and we have shown that [formula]. The other inclusion is obvious.
