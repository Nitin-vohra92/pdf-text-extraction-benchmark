We are going to show that new star product was found by Mebaraki for noncommutative curved space time has some properties when [formula] ( it has appeared in new multiplication) is a constant.

[formula]

Recently, Mebaraki, Khallili, Bussahel and Haouchine derived the Moyal-Weyl star product for a noncommutative curved space time[\cite=khallili]. So it is a non associative product and it was introduced in following form

[formula]

Where [formula] and "R" stands for the Reimann curvature tensor and [formula] means identity of spaces ( for example [formula] stands for identity of "f" space ) and so on. The physics will be approximate while the [formula] is not a constant or metric tensor as desired may be selected. the new star product is an approximate theory in terms of θ that B-C-H terms has its demands. So if we consider of [formula] is a constant we get to exact theory and we will have a good behavior theory otherwise many concepts will change for example [formula] and our theories will be very complex. However, this is an important class of non-commutativity for space time configurations with out curvature. Let's to derive the following formula in noncommutative flat space time ([formula] stands for Moyal star product)

[formula]

But in continue, we show that this isn't true for noncommutative curved space time with general metric.

[formula]

We start the proof of following formula for flat space time

[formula]

This is our starting point [formula] and [formula] so by the Moyal-Weyl map we get to (at this time, for convenient, we introduce [formula] )

[formula]

We introduce η = k + q so we have

[formula]

Again, we introduce α  =  η + p so we have

[formula]

From the Moyal-Weyl map we get to

[formula]

Where

[formula]

So we can write [\cite=wess]

[formula]

Now we get back to initials parameters α  =  η + p

[formula]

So

[formula]

We use the our proven method for another formula in flat space time (at this time, [formula])

[formula]

By the Moyal-Weyl map we get to

[formula]

At this time, we try to construct the similar formulas for the non-associative new star product. So we can write (again, we introduce [formula])

[formula]

we introduce η = q + p so we can write

[formula]

We introduce α = k + q + p

[formula]

Where

[formula]

So

[formula]

Now we get back to initials parameters

[formula]

Where [formula] so we can write

[formula]

For first class of [formula] we can write [formula] or [formula] then [formula] if [formula] then [formula] so

[formula]

Where [formula]. But for second class of [formula] ([formula] is a constant) we have [formula] so

[formula]

Where [formula] and by similar way we can find

[formula]

Where [formula]. Also we can write

[formula]

And for another formula we can write ([formula]) for calculate of [formula] We have

[formula]

Also [formula] where [formula] so we can write

[formula]

With the Moyal-Weyl map

[formula]

So we get to

[formula]

And for next formula ([formula])

[formula]

And for [formula] we can write

[formula]

Also we see that if ([formula]) we can write

[formula]

But we have

[formula]

Or

[formula]

For new equation ([formula]) and for

[formula]

We can write

[formula]

But this is sufficient to convert of θ  →    -  θ in last relation, so we have

[formula]

And

[formula]

And

[formula]

And

[formula]

And

[formula]

By new symbols we have

[formula]

Or

[formula]

And we will show it is ( the new star product ) a non-associative product much as Δx is a constant.

[formula]

This is not same with

[formula]

We see that these are not same.

Discussion

Formulas ware derived are useful when we work with new star product with special metric([formula] will be a constant). We have shown that they have different results than flat space time. This is important to calculate of laws of physics such as variational method in field theory and electrodynamics. We are sure that recent results will lead us to the old results while [formula].
