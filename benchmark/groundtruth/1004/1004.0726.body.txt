Dynamics of two planets in co-orbital motion

Introduction

In the restricted three-body problem there are different domains of stable motion associated to co-orbital motion. Each can be classified according to the center of libration of the critical argument, σ  =  λ  -  λ', where λ denotes the mean longitude of the minor body and λ' the same variable for the disturbing planet. These types of motion are known as: (i) Tadpole orbits, corresponding to a libration of σ around L4 or L5; (ii) Horseshoe orbits, where motion occurs around [formula] and encompasses both equilateral Lagrangian Points, and (iii) quasi-satellite (QS) orbits, where σ oscillates around zero.

The term "quasi-satellites" was originally introduced by Mikkola and Innanen (1997) and can be viewed as an extension of retrograde periodic orbits in the circular restricted three-body problem (e.g. Jackson 1913, Hénon 1969). Although not present for circular orbits, they exist for moderate to high eccentricities of the particle. In a reference frame rotating with the planet, QS orbits circle the planet like a retrograde satellite, although at distances so large that the particle is not gravitationally bounded to the planetary mass (Mikkola et al 2006).

The first object confirmed in a QS configuration was the asteroid 2002VE68 (Mikkola et al., 2004) with Venus as the host planet. The Earth has one temporary co-orbital object, (3753  Cruithne, Namouni et al. 1999), and one alternating horseshoe-QS object (2002AA29, Connors et al. 2002). The co-orbital asteroidal population in the inner Solar System was studied in Brasser et al. (2004) by numerical integrations. All QS orbits appear to be temporary, escaping in timescales of the order of 102 - 104 years

Wiegert et al. (2000) numerically investigated the stability of QS orbits around the giant planets of the Solar System. Although no stable solutions were found for Jupiter and Saturn, some initial conditions around Uranus and Neptune lead to QS orbits that survive for timescales of the order of 109 yr. It thus appears that a primordial population of such objects may still exist in the Solar System. Kortenkamp (2005) used N-body simulations to model the combined effects of solar nebula gas drag and gravitational scattering of planetesimals by a protoplanet. He showed that a significant fraction of scattered planetesimals could become trapped into QS trajectories. It then seems plausible that this trapped-to-captured transition may be important not only for the origin of captured satellites but also for continued growth of protoplanets.

At variance with these results, in the case of the general (non-restricted) three-body problem, although equilateral solutions and horseshoe orbits are well known, quasi-satellite configurations have only been studied very recently. Hadjidemetriou et al. (2009) performed a detailed study of periodic orbits in the 1/1 MMR for fictitious planetary systems with different mass ratios. They found that stable QS solutions occur for σ  =  Δλ  =  λ2  -  λ1  =  0 and [formula], where the subscripts identify each planet. Unstable trajectories were found at [formula]. Although at present there are no confirmed cases of exoplanets in quasi-satellite configurations, Godziewski & Konacki (2006) found that the radial velocity curves of the HD82943 and HD128311 planets could correspond to co-orbital motion in highly inclined orbits. Numerical simulations of both systems show QS trajectories, instead of Trojan orbits as initially believed.

In the present work we aim to revisit the 1/1 mean-motion resonance (MMR) in the planar planetary three-body problem, trying to identify possible domains of stable solutions and their location in the phase space. Section [\ref=regular] presents several dynamical maps constructed from numerical simulations for different initial conditions. These maps allow us to identify stable fixed points and periodic orbits, as well as the domains of regular motions. In Section [\ref=model] we develop a semi-analytical model for co-orbital planets, which is then applied in Section [\ref=op] to calculate the families of stable periodic orbits. In the same section we also present a brief study of the effects of an adiabatically slow mass variation in one of the planetary bodies. Finally, conclusions close the paper in Section [\ref=conclusions].

Dynamical Maps with Equal Mass Planets

Consider two planets with masses m1 and m2 in coplanar orbits around a star with mass [formula]. We will begin considering the case m2 = m1, also other mass ratios will be discussed in later sections. Let ai denote the semimajor axes, ei the eccentricities, λi the mean longitudes and ϖi the longitudes of pericenter. All orbital elements considered in this paper are assumed astrocentric and osculating. Throughout this work, m1 will be our "reference" planet: its mass will be fixed at one Jovian mass (m1  =  MJup) and the system scaled to initial condition a1  =  1 AU. The angular variables for co-orbital motion will then be defined as σ  =  λ2  -  λ1 and Δϖ  =  ϖ2  -  ϖ1.

As pointed out by Hadjidemetriou et al. (2009), for equal mass planets the periodic orbits are such that are located at a1 = a2 and e1 = e2. Accordingly, we fixed the semimajor axes and eccentricities, and constructed a 100  ×  100 grid of initial conditions varying both σ and Δϖ between zero and [formula]. Each point in the grid was then numerically integrated over 3000 orbital periods using a Bulirsch-Stoer based N-body code, and we calculated the averaged MEGNO chaos indicator 〈Y〉 (Cincotta & Simó, 2000) to identify regions of regular or chaotic motion. Results are shown in Figure [\ref=fig1] for six values of the initial eccentricities ei; dashed regions correspond to unstable orbits while white was used to identify stable solutions. An analysis of these plots show the following characteristics:

For low initial eccentricities (ei = 0.05) the maps show two disconnected strips of regular motion, corresponding to motion around [formula] and any value of Δϖ.

For moderate low to intermediate initial eccentricities (ei = 0.15 and ei = 0.30) the vertical strips of regular motion become thinner and slightly distorted. A new stable domain is now present, associated to QS orbits, and located around σ = 0.

For high initial eccentricities (ei  ≥  0.40) the domain of QS orbits increases and covers a significant portion of the plane of initial conditions. Conversely, the distorted vertical strips shrink and each seems to break into two islands of stable motion. The smaller islands encompass equilateral solutions, although they almost disappear for ei = 0.70. The larger islands correspond to a different type of asymmetric solution, and their locations tend towards the center of the plots as the eccentricities increase.

Due to symmetry present in the dynamical system, the results are invariant to transformations of the type (σ,Δϖ)  →  ( - σ, - Δϖ). In fact, since m1 = m2, both equilateral solutions are actually the same solution, since we can pass from one to the other just by redefining the reference planet. However, since later sections will discuss the case m2  ≠  m1, we prefer to treat both equilateral solutions separately.

Although MEGNO is a very efficient tool to identify chaotic motion, it is not suited to distinguish between different types of regular orbits (e.g. fixed points, periodic orbits, etc.). Sometimes this task is performed with a Fourier transform of the numerical data (e.g. Michtchenko et al. 2008ab); however, here we have chosen a different route. Starting from the output of each numerical simulation, we calculated the amplitudes of oscillation in each angular variable. Initial conditions with zero amplitude in σ correspond to σ-family periodic orbits of the co-orbital system, while solutions with zero amplitude in Δϖ will correspond to periodic orbits of the so-called Δϖ-family (see Michtchenko et al. 2008ab). Finally, stationary solutions of the averaged problem, identified as intersections of both families, may be thought as analogous to the apsidal corotation resonances (ACR) found in other mean-motion resonances (e.g. Beaugé et al. 2003). The equilateral Lagrangian solutions will appear as ACR in these plots.

The gray scale graphs in Figure [\ref=fig2] show values of the amplitudes in σ (left) and Δϖ (right) for four of the plots shown in figure [\ref=fig1]. White regions represent initial conditions with semi-amplitudes smaller than [formula], as thus indicate the families of periodic orbits in each angle. Darker regions correspond to increasing amplitudes (up to [formula]) and denote initial conditions with quasi-periodic motion. The dashed areas are unstable solutions. Finally, it is worthwhile mentioning that symmetric configurations may either correspond to an alignment ([formula]) or an antialignment of the apses ([formula]) while asymmetric configurations have stationary values of Δϖ different from the above.

For low eccentricities (ei = 0.05) we observe four asymmetric ACR solutions. Two are the well known Lagrangian equilateral solutions located at [formula]. By analogy with the restricted problem, we will denote them L4 and L5. As far as we know, the remaining two ACR have not been previously reported, and are located at approximately [formula]. We have called them Anti-Lagrangian solutions and they are connected to the classical equilateral Lagrangian solutions by the σ-family of periodic orbits. By analogy, we have denoted the new solutions as:

[formula]

As with all previous stationary solutions, these asymmetric points are found at a1 = a2.

As the eccentricities grow (e.g. ei = 0.40) the QS region at [formula] causes a distortion and compression of the stable asymmetric domain. The Anti-Lagrangian zone seems less affected and surrounded by a larger island of stable motion. This effect is even more pronounced for ei = 0.60 and ei = 0.70 where the stable domain around L4 and L5 almost disappear. The region around AL4 and AL5 are still visible, although they also decrease in size and their location approaches the unstable symmetric periodic orbit located at [formula].

The decrease in the size of the stable regions around the asymmetric ACR solutions is accompanied by a significant increase in the stable domains around QS orbits, which, for high eccentricities, seem to cover a large proportion of the plane. Inside this region we also note two families of periodic orbits; the Δϖ-family which is restricted to a small region around [formula], and a smaller σ-family close to zero value of the resonant angle.

Table [\ref=tab_pos] summarizes the detected stable stationary solutions in the planar planetary three-body problem, as well as their location in the plane of angular variables for low eccentricities.

Motion Around the Stationary Solutions

In order to visualize the dynamics of stable orbits outside the ACR, we integrated several orbits with initial elements a1 = a2 = 1 AU, e1 = e2 = 0.4, σ = 0 and different values of Δϖ. Each initial condition was chosen along line A drawn in Fig. [\ref=fig1] for ei = 0.40. Results are shown in Figure [\ref=fig3]. The left-hand plot shows the orbital evolution in the (e2,Δϖ) plane, while the right-hand graph presents the variation of (e2,σ). In both cases the numerical output was filtered to eliminate short-period variations associated to the mean anomalies of both planets. Note that all trajectories display small-amplitude oscillations in σ, consistent with starting positions near the σ-family of periodic orbits.

The behavior in the (e2,Δϖ) plane is more intriguing. Initial conditions with [formula] exhibit oscillations of different amplitudes around the ACR solutions corresponding to quasi-satellite motion. Recall that this ACR solutions is located at [formula]. However, initial conditions with [formula] display regular motion that seem associated to large amplitude oscillations around Δϖ  =  0, even though this is an unstable point leading to close encounters and a collision between both planets. Nevertheless, there appears to be a minimum allowed amplitude for these solutions (shown in Figure [\ref=fig3] as a blue dashed curve), which corresponds to a semi-amplitude in Δϖ of approximately [formula]. Smaller amplitudes are unstable and lead to the ejection of one of the planets in short timescales.

Figure [\ref=fig4] shows results for initial conditions inside the stable region connecting L4 and AL4. Semimajor axes and eccentricities were the same as in the previous plots. The initial values of Δϖ were varied from zero to [formula], and in each case σ was chosen along line B in Fig. [\ref=fig1] for ei = 0.4 ( σ-family).

The (e2,Δϖ) plane (left frame) shows two centers of oscillation, one corresponding to each ACR, and identified by red dots. L4 is located at [formula] while AL4 roughly at [formula]. As before, we see a smooth transition in the dynamical behavior between both modes, with no evidence of any separatrix. Consequently, it appears that any initial condition will lead to a stable oscillation of Δϖ around the nearest stationary solution.

The motion of the resonant angle σ (right frame) shows a different behavior. Only initial conditions very close to either L4 or AL4 will show a small-amplitude circulation around the corresponding stationary point. As an example, notice some trajectories oscillating around [formula] without reaching the fixed points. Finally, due to the intrinsic symmetry in co-orbital motion, the same behavior is also noted for initial conditions between L5 and AL5.

To better visualize each stable configuration, Figure [\ref=fig5] presents the orbit scheme for five stable solutions, whose initial values of the angles are shown in the top left-hand frame. Five initial conditions correspond to the stable ACR solution discussed previously (QS, L4, L5, AL4, AL5). Each of the other plots show the orbital representation of each solutions in (x,y) astrocentric cartesian coordinates. Initial conditions for both planets are shown in open circles, with m1 located along the x-axis. Both axis directions are fixed. The orbital trajectory of each planet (over one period) is drawn in thin black lines, and the configuration leading to a maximum approach between both planets is shown with crosses. For QS, L4 and L5, the minimum distance coincides with the initial condition.

For QS orbits, the relative position of m2 is always located in the positive x-axis, similar to the behavior noted in the restricted three-body problem (Mikkola et al. 2006). The relative motion of all five ACR solutions are periodic orbits, and symmetric with respect to the x-axis.

Semi Analytical Model

One drawback in the previous numerical approach is the excessive CPU time required for the construction of each dynamical map. In order to extended these results to other values of the parameter space (e.g. planetary masses, eccentricities) it is useful to construct a semi-analytical model for the co-orbital motion.

Such a model can be developed along similar lines as other mean-motion resonances (e.g. Michtchenko et al, 2006, 2008a, b). It requires two main steps: first, a transformation to adequate resonant variables and, second, a numerical averaging of the Hamiltonian with respect to short-period terms. Both tasks are detailed below.

We begin introducing the usual mass-weighted Poincaré canonical variables (e.g Laskar 1990) for each planet mi:

[formula]

where μi  =  κ2(m0 + mi), κ denotes the gravitational constant, and mi' is the reduced mass of each body, given by:

[formula]

The Hamiltonian function F can be expressed as F  =  F0  +  F1, where F0 corresponds to the two-body contribution, and has the form:

[formula]

The second term, F1, is the disturbing function which can be written as:

[formula]

where Δ is the instantaneous distance between the two planets, and T1 is the indirect part of the potential energy of the gravitational interaction (see Laskar 1990, Laskar and Robutel 1995 for more details).

For initial conditions in the vicinity of co-orbital motion, we define the following set of planar resonant canonical variables (I1,I2,K,AM,σ,Δϖ,Q,q), where:

[formula]

where, [formula] and [formula]. A generic argument φ of the disturbing function can be written as:

[formula]

where jk are integers. In terms of the new angles the same argument may be written as:

[formula]

Since q is a cyclic angle, the associated action AM is a constant of motion (total angular momentum) of the system.

The next step is an averaging of the Hamiltonian over the fast angle Q. This procedure can be performed numerically, allowing to evaluate the averaged Hamiltonian [formula] as:

[formula]

In the averaged variables, K is a new integral of motion which, in analogy to other mean-motion resonances (e.g. Michtchenko et al. 2008a), we call the scaling parameter.

[formula] then constitutes a system with two degrees of freedom in the canonical variables (I1,I2,σ,Δϖ), parametrized by the values of both K and AM. Since the numerical integration depicted in equation ([\ref=aver]) is equivalent to a first-order averaging of the Hamiltonian function (e.g. Ferraz-Mello, S. 2007), only those periodic terms ([\ref=pphi]) with j1 + j2 = 0 remain in [formula]. In consequence, we can rewrite the generic resonant argument of the averaged system as:

[formula]

where the index j2,j4 are integers that may take any value in the interval ( -   ∞  ,  ∞  ).

Families of Periodic Orbits

In the averaged system defined by [formula] exact zero-amplitude ACR solutions are given by the stationary conditions:

[formula]

and can therefore be identified as extrema of the averaged Hamiltonian function. In the present section we will use this approach to estimate the families of different ACR as function of the planetary masses and eccentricities, and compare the results with numerical integrations of the exact equations of motion.

Families of Symmetric ACR. QS

We begin calculating the exact stationary solutions, corresponding to QS configurations, as a function of the eccentricities, and for different values of the planetary masses. As mentioned in Hadjidemetriou et al. (2009), the locations and stability of the ACR do not appear dependent on the individual values of the masses, but only on their ratio m2 / m1.

In all cases, the stationary values of the canonical momenta Li are such that n1 = n2, where ni are the mean motions of the planets. For equal mass planets, this reduces to the condition a1 = a2. Finally, the angles of the exact ACR always remain locked at [formula]. Hadjidemetriou et al (2009) presented similar plots for the same mass ratios.

Figure [\ref=fig6] shows the families of stable zero-amplitude QS orbits for selected mass ratios: m2 / m1  =  1 / 3, m2 / m1  =  1, and m2 / m1  >  1. For equal masses, all solutions occur for and e1 = e2. Due to the intrinsic symmetry of the dynamical system, the family of stationary solutions for m2 / m1  =  1 / 3 is a mirror image of the solution for m2 / m1  =  3, since it may be obtained by simply interchanging e1 with e2. In the case of m2 / m1  =  3, we note that e2  <  e1 for e2  <  0.565, while e2  >  e1 for more elliptic orbits. Figure [\ref=fig6] shows also the solutions for m2 / m1  =  2,  5,  20 mass ratios. For mass ratios smaller than unity, the solutions are mirror images with respect to the family m2 / m1  =  1. Note that the families of stable solutions approach e1 = e2 as m2  →  m1. However, as the mass ratio tends towards the restricted three-body problem, the eccentricity of the smaller mass approaches unity. Finally, the solution ei = 0.565 is common to all the QS families, and corresponds to a global extrema of the Hamiltonian in this plane. A similar structure was already noted by Michtchenko et al. (2006) for other mean-motion resonances.

Families of Asymmetric ACR Solutions. L4 and AL4

The same procedure can also be applied to the Lagrangian L4 and Anti-Lagrangian AL4 configurations. Recall that the dynamical maps (Figure [\ref=fig2]) showed a symmetry with respect to the transformation (σ,Δϖ)  →  ( - σ, - Δϖ), so the results discussed here can also be applied to the L5 and AL5 solution, by applying the same operation on the variables.

The ACR solution associated to the Lagrangian solution L4 shows no variation in the angles, maintaining constant both angles at [formula]. The solutions remain stable for initial conditions up to eccentricities ei = 0.7. However, the AL4 shows significant changes as function of the eccentricities. Figure [\ref=fig7] shows the equilibrium values of both angles for the family of AL4, as a function of the eccentricity of the smallest planet, for several values of the mass ratio m2 / m1. The resonant angle σ increases monotonically from [formula], at quasi-circular orbits, towards [formula] for near parabolic trajectories. As the mass ratios increases, the maximum value of the resonant angle decreases, reaching [formula] for a mass ratio of m2 / m1 = 10.

The secular angle Δϖ shows a slightly more complex behavior. Initially it increases from [formula] until it reaches a maximum value close to [formula], after which it once again decreases towards [formula]. The planetary eccentricity corresponding to the maximum in the secular angle increases with the mass ratio, approaching the parabolic limit for m2 / m1  ~  10.

As shown in Figures [\ref=fig1] and [\ref=fig2], the size of the stable region around each asymmetric solution decreases with the increase of ei, and practically disappears as the angles approach [formula] degrees. For quasi-parabolic orbits, only the region around AL4 is discernible. Thus, for high eccentricity planets in co-orbital motion, it appears that the AL4 and AL5 asymmetric solutions are more regular than the classical equilibrium Lagrangian solutions L4 and L5.

The values of the planetary eccentricities at AL4 for different mass ratios is presented in Figure [\ref=fig8]. Contrary to the QS trajectories, there appears to be a purely linear dependence between e2 and e1 as a function of the mass ratio. In fact, a simple numerical analysis of the results appears to indicate that

[formula]

Thus, for mass ratios approaching the restricted three-body problem (with m2  →  0) it should be expected that the eccentricity of the massive planet m1 at the AL4 solution would tend towards zero.

Finally, the equilibrium values of the semimajor axes also change as function of the mass ratio. Here, however, it is easy to see from the stationary conditions ([\ref=eq_hamil]) that a zero-amplitude AL4 trajectory is characterized by the relation n1  =  n2. For equal mass planets, this reduces to a1 = a2.

The families of stationary solutions presented in this section were calculated using our semi-analytical model. In order to compare them with actual numerical simulations of the exact equations, we choose four solutions from Figure [\ref=fig7] with e1 = 0.2, but corresponding to different mass ratios. Each was then numerically integrated for several orbital periods, assuming zero initial values for the cyclic angular variables q and Q. Results are shown in Figure [\ref=fig9], where the top frame presents the trajectories in the plane (e1 cos σ,e1 sin σ) and the bottom graph in the plane (e2 cos Δϖ,e2 sin Δϖ). Each initial condition shows a small amplitude oscillation around the stationary value, which presents a very good agreement with the family of AL4 solutions calculated with our model (black curve).

Adiabatic Mass Variation in AL4

As a final analysis, in this section we study the orbital evolution of a system initially near AL4, when the mass of one of the planets is decreased adiabatically. This question is raised for three reasons. First, as shown by Lee (2004), for two planets in a 2/1 mean-motion resonance, a sufficiently slow change in one of the masses will preserve the resonant configuration and allow to calculate the variation of the ACR as a function of m2 / m1. In other words, this approach provides a different numerical test of our semi-analytical model and an alternative way to calculate the stationary orbits. Second, the results will also allow us to test the robustness of the new asymmetric co-orbital solutions AL4 and see how they respond to changes in the parameters of the system. Finally, we wish to analyze the behavior of these new solutions in the limit of the restricted three-body problem, corresponding to m2 = 0.

Figure [\ref=fig10] shows a typical example. Initial conditions correspond to an AL4 solution for m2 / m1  =  1 and ei  =  0.2. While m1 was maintained fixed, m2 was varied linearly down to m2 = 0 in a timescale of 106 orbital periods. We checked using other timescales, finding no significant variations. This guarantees that we are effectively in the adiabatic regime.

The top graph of Figure [\ref=fig10] shows the evolution of the orbital eccentricities as function of the mass ratio. As soon as m2 / m1 departs from unity, the value of e2 increases while e1 decreases. The broken black curve that can be seen over the red curve shows the predicted value of e1 applying the relation ([\ref=e1e2]) to each value of e2. The agreement is excellent, giving an additional corroboration to this empirical relationship between the eccentricities. It must be noted that neither the total angular momentum AM nor the scaling parameter K are preserved during the mass change. The bottom plot of Figure [\ref=fig10] shows the behavior of the angular values during the mass variation. The equilibrium values of both σ and Δϖ remain practically unchanged.

For smaller mass ratios m1 tends towards a circular orbit, while the eccentricity of the smaller planet approaches e2  ~  0.4. This seems to imply that the asymmetric AL4 (and consequently AL5) solutions could also exist in the limit of the restricted three-body problem. To test this conjecture and compare the trajectories of both L4 and AL4 solutions in the restricted (m2  →  0) limit, Figure [\ref=fig11] plots the (x,y) cartesian coordinates of two initial conditions in a rotating pulsating reference frame.

In the rotating pulsating reference frame the positions of both m0 and m1 are fixed in the x-axis (shown with large solid circles). Three orbital evolutions are shown: the brown dot corresponds to initial conditions in the asymmetric L4, while red dots map the evolution of an orbit originally in AL4. In both cases we started with m2 = m1, but subsequently decreased m2 to zero (restricted case). No change is noticed in the L4 orbit, and the trajectory remained in an equilateral configuration with the two finite masses. However, the AL4 solution converged towards a tadpole-type orbit of large amplitude (blue curve) for m2  →  0. This solution corresponds to a periodic orbit whose period coincides with the orbital period of the primaries around the center of mass. Green dots map the evolution of an orbit originally in QS. As we can see the orbit described by QS configuration revolves around the m1, in the same way that was observed in the restricted problem.

Thus, there appears to be a structural difference between the L4 and AL4 planetary solutions discussed in this paper. Although both appear as ACR (fixed points in the averaged problem) the first are true stationary solutions in the unaveraged rotating frame, while the new solutions AL4 are actually large amplitude periodic orbits that encompass the classical Lagrangian equilateral solution.

Conclusions

We studied the stability regions and families of periodic orbits of two-planet systems in the vicinity of a 1/1 mean-motion resonance (i.e. co-orbital configuration). We considered different ratios of planetary masses and orbital eccentricities, also we assumed that both planets share the same orbital plane (coplanar motion).

As result we identified two separate regions of stability, each with two distinct modes of motion:

Quasi-Satellite region: Originally identified by Hadjidemetriou et al. (2009) for the planetary problem, QS orbits correspond to oscillations around an ACR located at [formula]. Although not present for quasi-circular trajectories, they fill a considerable portion of the phase space in the case of moderate to high eccentricities.

We also found a new regime, associated to stable orbits displaying oscillations around (σ,Δϖ)  =  (0,0), even though this point is unstable and corresponds to a collision between the two planets.

Lagrangian region: Apart from the previous symmetric solutions, we also found two distinct types of asymmetric ACR orbits in which both σ and Δϖ oscillate around values different from 0 or [formula]. The first is the classical equilateral Lagrangian solution associated to local maxima of the averaged Hamiltonian function. Independently of the mass ratio m2 / m1 and their eccentricities, these solutions are always located at [formula]. However, the size of the stable domain decreases rapidly for increasing eccentricities, being practically undetectable for ei  >  0.7.

The second type of asymmetric ACR correspond to local minima of the averaged Hamiltonian function. We have dubbed them Anti-Lagrangian solutions (AL4 and AL5). For low eccentricities, they are located at [formula]. Each is connected to the classical L4 and L5 solution through the σ-family of periodic orbits in the averaged system. Contrary to the classical equilateral Lagrangian solution, their location in the plane (σ,Δϖ) varies with the planetary mass ratio and eccentricities. Although their stability domain also shrinks for increasing values of ei they do so at a slower rate than the classical Lagrangian solutions, and are still appreciable for eccentricities as high as ~  0.7.

Finally, we also applied an ad-hoc adiabatically slow mass variation to one of the planetary bodies, and analyzed its effect on the AL4 configuration. We found that the resonant co-orbital solution was preserved, with practically no change in the equilibrium values of the angles. The eccentricities, however, varied with the larger planet approaching a quasi-circular orbit as the smaller planet had its eccentricity increased. These solution still exist in the limit of the restricted three-body problem (i.e. m2  →  0), although both types of asymmetric solutions (L4 and AL4) have different geometries. While the first are true stationary solutions in the unaveraged system, the latter are periodic orbits around the classical equilateral Lagrangian points.
