on the maximal rank conjecture for line bundles of extremal degree

introduction.

A central problem in curve theory is to describe algebraic curves in a given projective space [formula] ([formula]) with fixed genus and degree. For instance, one wants to describe the ideal of a curve [formula], and in particular, to know the Hilbert function of C, or in geometric terms, how many independent hypersurfaces of each degree C lies on. A major open problem here is the maximal rank conjecture, that appeared in Eisenbud-Harris [\cite=EH2]:

(Maximal rank conjecture) For fixed d, g, [formula], let C be a general curve of genus g and |L| be a general grd on C, then the multiplication map

[formula]

is of maximal rank (either injective or surjective) for any [formula].

In the case |L| gives an embedding of C into [formula], [formula] is the space of homogeneous polynomials of degree k in [formula] and [formula] is just the subspace consisting of those vanishing on C. By the Gieseker-Petri theorem, on a general curve C, Lk is always non-special for [formula]. Thus the dimension of the domain and target of μk are constants only depending on k, d, r and g. Therefore, the maximal rank conjecture (MRC) simply says that the number of independent hypersurfaces containing C is as small as it could be.

Since conjecture [\ref=maximal] concerns conditions that are open, it suffices to prove the statement for one point on each component of the parameter space Grd which dominates Mg, where

[formula]

However, if genus is large, it is very difficult to write down smooth curves satisfying the conjecture. The classic strategy to deal with this problem is to degenerate smooth curves to some special singular ones and try to verify the conjecture on these singular curves. By degenerating to reducible curves with embedded points and using a rather complex inductive argument, Ballico and Ellia proved the MRC for non-special linear series in [\cite=BE], [\cite=BE1], and [\cite=BE2]. So the main interest now is in the case of special linear series on general curves.

In another development, it is proved in Green and Lazarsfeld [\cite=GL1] that any very ample line bundle L on C with

[formula]

or equivalently

[formula]

is projectively normal, where Cliff(C) is the clifford index of C:

[formula]

and

[formula]

and for a general curve C, [formula].

It is also showed by Green and Lazarsfeld that the bound 2g + 1 - 2h1(L) - Cliff(C) is the best possible. There are line bundles of degree one less than this bound which are not normally generated. We say a line bundle L on C has extremal degree if

[formula]

that is,

[formula]

On the other hand, if the maximal rank conjecture were true, we should still expect projective normality for general line bundles of extremal degree on general curves. Thus the extremal degree range should be thought of as the first case to test the maximal rank conjecture. There are four cases according to the value of h1(L):

h1(L) = 0. L is non special and the MRC follows from [\cite=BE2].

h1(L) = 1. If g = 2l even, L is a gl3l - 1 and ρ = l - 1; if g = 2l + 1 odd, L is a gl3l and ρ = l.

h1(L) = 2. If g = 2l even, L is a gl - 13l - 3 and ρ = 0; if g = 2l + 1 odd, L is a gl - 13l - 2 and ρ = 1.

h1(L)  ≥  3. The Brill-Noether number is negative. There are no such grd's [formula] on a general curve.

In this paper, we prove the MRC for the remaining open cases (2) and (3).

Let C be a general curve of genus g (g  ≥  10 if g even, g  ≥  13 if g odd), L be a general line bundle of extremal degree on C, then (C,L) satisfies the MRC, or equivalently, is projectively normal.

By theorem (4.e.1) of ([\cite=Gr]), in our degree range, it suffices to prove μ2 in ([\ref=mmap]) is surjective. We apply a new method, using deformation theory, to prove this fact. The general idea of this method is as follows. Instead of looking for some (C0,L0) such that μ2 is of maximal rank there, consider a one parameter family of pairs (Ct,Lt)∈Wrd, specializing to some (C0,L0) (C0 could be singular) with μ2(0) not necessarily of maximal rank. Suppose moreover that all global sections of L0 extends to Lt. Then one can construct obstruction maps

[formula]

and inductively

[formula]

such that an element [formula] extends to [formula] modulo tn + 1 if and only if δi(s) = 0 for i = 0,...,n.

For the decreasing sequence

[formula]

if we can show that the vector space [formula] consisting of elements which deform to [formula] to any order is of correct dimension", then μ2(t) is of maximal rank. Said differently, it suffices to prove that δn is of maximal rank for some [formula].

We find a nice singular curve C0 on which the computation of obstructions is surprisingly simple. Enough information in the obstruction maps δn is captured by the natural multiplication map

[formula]

in the following theorem:

Let L  →  C be the total space of a one parameter family (Ct,Lt)∈Wrd degenerating to (C0,L0) with [formula] a nodal curve consisting of two smooth curves of genus gX, gY meeting at a point p and C is smooth. Write Ln  =  L(nY)|C0. Suppose all (global) sections of Ln extend to Lt for |n|  ≤  a and the natural map

[formula]

is surjective (resp. of rank [formula]) for some [formula], then the multiplication map μ2(t) is surjective (resp. injective) for small [formula].

Notice that κ only depends on (C0,L0), not on the actual family specializing to it. It seems to the author that such a simple way to describe higher order obstructions is new and should have a lot more applications.

The significance of theorem [\ref=new] is that we are now reduced to finding a smoothable (C0,L0) such that all sections of Ln extend to the nearby fiber and [formula] (instead of κ0  =  μ2(0)) is of required rank. By making a good choice of (C0,L0), we manage to prove theorem [\ref=main_thm] by showing that κ in theorem [\ref=new] is surjective.

This paper is organized as follows:

In section 2, we set up some machinery which measures the obstructions for elements of [formula] to extend to [formula].

In section 3, we compute the obstruction maps δn for the special degeneration described in theorem [\ref=new] and give a proof of this theorem.

Section 4 contains a proof of the main theorem [\ref=main_thm].

Finally, in section 5, we include some technical facts about canonical bundles on general curves which are needed in the proof of the main theorem.

infinitesimal study of the degeneracy loci

Let C0 be a reduced l.c.i curve over [formula] and L0 be a degree d line bundle on C0 with h0(L0) = r + 1. By theorem 4.1 in [\cite=W], the deformations of the pair (C0,L0) are unobstructed. Let S be the versal deformation space of (C0,L0), then S is smooth near (C0,L0). Let Wrd be the subvariety of S consists of (C,L) such that h0(L)  ≥  r + 1. Consider the multiplication map

[formula]

We may think of this map as a morphism between two vector bundles (at least near the point (C0,L0)) over Wrd as (C,L) varies in Wrd. We are interested in the infinitesimal properties of the locus D consisting of (C,L) such that the multiplication map is not of maximal rank, i.e it is neither injective nor surjective. Our goal is to show that D is a proper subvariety of Wrd (assuming Wrd irreducible near (C0,L0)).

Suppose now that there is a (flat) one parameter family (Ct,Lt) of pairs specializing to (C0,L0) such that all sections of L0 extend to Lt. If μk(0) is not of maximal rank at (C0,L0), then the dimension of [formula] is bigger than expected. We would like to knock down this dimension by showing that only a expected number of independent sections of [formula] can extend to [formula]. Thus μk(t) is of maximal rank for [formula].

Our goal in this section is to set up some machinery which measures the obstructions for elements of [formula] to extend to [formula].

To this end, let (C,L) be the total space of the one parameter family and (Cn,Ln) be the restriction of (C,L) to [formula]. Let [formula], Nn = H0(Cn,Lkn) and μn:Mn  →  Nn be the multiplication map.

We have [formula], [formula] compatibly with μi for any [formula].

Under the above notations and assumptions, there exist obstruction maps

[formula]

for [formula] such that δ0  =  μ0 and [formula] can be lifted to [formula] if and only if δi(s) = 0 for i = 0,...,n.

For each [formula] consider

[formula]

Let [formula] be the connecting homomorphism of ([\ref=obstruction]) from snake lemma. Fix [formula] and [formula]. Suppose s0 has a lifting [formula]. Let sn + 1'∈Mn + 1 be any lifting of sn. Suppose that μn + 1(sn + 1') = tn + 1v with

[formula]

then

[formula]

On the other hand, if ([\ref=solution]) has no solution for any collection sj'∈Mj with [formula], then s0 has no lifting to [formula].

Now, simply define δn + 1(s0) = δn + 1'(sn) = v as an element of

[formula]

Then δn + 1(s0) does not depend on the choice of sn and is equal to zero in [formula] if and only if s0 can be lifted to [formula].

Finally, we check

[formula]

By theorem 3.1 in [\cite=W], (C1,L1) determines a tangent vector [formula] which annihilates H0(C0,L0). This means exactly that ξ is tangent to Wrd  ⊂  S at (C0,L0). ξ is a tangent direction such that the rank of μk0 does not increase if and only if

[formula]

is zero. If this is the case, then every element in [formula] extends to [formula], thus to first order, the rank of the map μk does not increase (It does not decrease either, by lower semicontinuity of the rank).

On the other hand, if δ1 is of maximal rank, there are two cases:

1) δ1 is injective. No elements of [formula] will extend to [formula], thus for a general [formula], the multiplication map ([\ref=multiplication]) is injective at (Ct,Lt).

2) δ1 is surjective. Only a subspace of [formula] of dimension [formula] will extend to first order, therefore, for the nearby (Ct,Lt), the multiplication map ([\ref=multiplication]) is surjective.

Suppose now that δ1 is not of maximal rank. It is not possible to test if the nearby multiplication map is of maximal rank to first order. We have to look at the higher order obstruction maps δn.

By lemma [\ref=lemma5.1], any [formula] can be extended to [formula] if and only if δi(s) = 0 for i = 0,...,n. Let n be the smallest integer such that δn is of maximal rank (if it exists). Since the index of δi [formula] is always constant for any i, we see that only a subspace of [formula] of expected dimension (0 if δn injective, Ind δn if δn surjective) can be extended to [formula]. Therefore, the multiplication maps for nearby fibers are of maximal rank.

We have proved the following proposition:

If δn is of maximal rank for some [formula], the multiplication map μk is of maximal rank for nearby fibers.

A nice degeneration

To use proposition [\ref=sufficient], we need to compute the obstruction maps δn, which in general is difficult. However, for the k = 2 case, there is a nice degeneration on which the computation is surprisingly simple.

Let L  →  C be the total space of a one parameter family (Ct,Lt)∈Wrd degenerating to (C0,L0) with [formula] a nodal curve consisting of two smooth curves of genus gX, gY meeting at a point p. Write Ln  =  L(nY)|C0. Suppose all sections of Ln extend to Lt for |n|  ≤  a. Notice that Ln|X = L0|X(np) and Ln|Y = L0|Y( - np), thus Ln only depends on (C0,L0), not on the family specializing to it.

The multiplication map

[formula]

is usually not of maximal rank here, which means dimension of [formula] is bigger than it should be.

There are some obvious elements in [formula]. Let W be the subspace of [formula] spanned by

[formula]

Clearly W is a subspace of [formula]. Let's compute the image of W under

[formula]

Let σ̃, [formula] be sections of L which extend σ, τ respectively (They always exist, since by assumption, all sections of L0 extend to Lt). Then σ̃  =  σ̃'sX,   =  'sY, where sX (resp. sY) is a section of OC(X) (resp. OC(Y)) which vanishes exactly on X (resp Y) and σ̃' (resp. ') is a section of L( - X) (resp. L( - Y)). By the construction of δ1,

[formula]

Therefore, the image of W under δ1 is equal to the image of the composition

[formula]

δ1 in general is not injective. Let α be any section of L( - 2X), β be any section of L( - 2Y). Then [formula], and [formula]. Clearly [formula] as in diagram ([\ref=obstruction]), and therefore

[formula]

Thus the image of δ2 contains the image of the composition

[formula]

Similarly, the image of δn contains the image of the composition

[formula]

Therefore, we have a surjection

[formula]

The above analysis immediately gives a proof of theorem [\ref=new] because if

[formula]

is surjective (resp. of rank [formula]) for some [formula], then δa is of maximal rank and therefore by proposition [\ref=sufficient], the multiplication map μ2(t) is surjective (resp. injective) for small [formula].

proof of the main theorem

We will prove theorem [\ref=main_thm] in this section.

Notice that in our degree and genus range, the MRC for L is equivalent to the statement that L is projectively normal. By theorem (4.e.1) of [\cite=Gr], in our degree range, [formula] is surjective for any [formula]. Thus to show such L is projectively normal, it suffices to show the multiplication map μ2 in ([\ref=multiplication]) is surjective.

The idea is to make a good choice of (C0,L0) such that the hypothesis of theorem [\ref=new] is satisfied. We need the following lemma:

Let (C0,L0) be the same as theorem [\ref=new]. Write LX = L0|X and LY = L0|Y. Suppose the restriction maps H0(C0,Ln)  →  H0(X,LX(np)) and H0(C0,Ln)  →  H0(Y,LY( - np)) are surjective for - a  ≤  n  ≤  a. If

[formula]

and

[formula]

are both surjective, then the natural map κ in ([\ref=kappa]) is surjective.

Let s be any element of H0(C0,L20). Since ([\ref=4.1]) is surjective, and any section of LX(np) extends to a section of Ln, we can modify s by some element in the image of κ such that [formula]. Thus we can assume [formula], then s|Y∈H0(L2Y( - p)). Since ([\ref=4.2]) is surjective, [formula] with xn∈H0(LY(np)), yn∈H0(LY(( - n - 1)p)). We can view yn as a section of H0(LY( - np)) which vanishes at p, thus can be extended constantly 0 to X as a section of Ln. Still call it yn. Extend xn arbitrarily to X as a section of L- n. Then [formula].

We now take [formula], where X and Y are general curves of genus gX, gY meeting transversely at a general point p. In particular, p is not a Weierstrass point of either X or Y. We will divide the proof of the main theorem [\ref=main_thm] into two parts, according to the value of h1(L).

h1(L) = 2 case

Since the residual series N of L is either a g1l + 1 or g1l + 2 depending on g = 2l even or g = 2l + 1 odd. We will work backwards by starting with a line bundle N with h0(N) = 1 and take its residual. Here we take a simple N whose restriction to X and Y are just suitable multiples of OX(p) and OY(p), then take L0 as the residual series of N.

There are two subcases:

g = 2l even. Here we are dealing with gl - 13l - 3's. ([formula]. l = 5 needs a special argument and is proved in the appendix.) Let gX = gY = l, [formula] and [formula].

g = 2l + 1 odd. L is a gl - 13l - 2 ([formula]). Take gX = l + 1, gY = l, [formula], and [formula]

In both cases, it is easy to prove using the theory of limit linear series (see [\cite=EH1]) that (C0,L0) are smoothable in such a way all sections of L0 extend to nearby. More precisely, the corresponding limit linear series on C0 has aspects VX = (l - 1)p + |KX|, VY = (l - 1)p + |KY| in case g = 2l, and VX = (l - 1)p + |K( - p)|, VY = lp + |KY| in case g = 2l + 1. They are both smoothable because the variety of limit liner series with the same ramification sequence as (VX,VY) at p has expected dimensions.

For (C0,L0) as described above, the natural map ([\ref=kappa]) is surjective.

Case (1). Here [formula], [formula]. Apply lemma [\ref=lemma5.1] or [\ref=lemma5.2] for [formula], LX satisfies ([\ref=4.1]). Meantime, [formula] and [formula] is either l - 1 or l depending on l even or odd. Again by lemma [\ref=lemma5.1] or [\ref=lemma5.2], LY satisfies ([\ref=4.2]).

Case (2). Take [formula]. [formula], [formula], [formula].

If l even, by lemma [\ref=lemma5.2], we see that LY satisfies ([\ref=4.1]) and LX satisfies ([\ref=4.2]) (notice gX = l + 1).

If l odd, again by lemma [\ref=lemma5.2], LX satisfies ([\ref=4.1]) and LY satisfies ([\ref=4.2]).

Thus in either case, the hypotheses of lemma [\ref=tech] are satisfied, and therefore κ in ([\ref=kappa]) is surjective.

h1(L) = 1 case

We are dealing with the residual series of g0l - 1's if g = 2l and g0l's if g = 2l + 1, so smoothability is not a problem. Again there are two subcases:

g = 2l even. L is a gl3l - 1. Let gX = gY = l, DX (resp. DY) be a divisor consisting of [formula] (resp. [formula]) general points on X (resp. Y). Take LX = KX(p - DX), LY = KY(p - DY).

g = 2l + 1 odd. L is a gl3l. Let gX = l + 1, gY = l DX a general divisor of degree [formula] on X and DY a general divisor of degree [formula] on Y. Take LX = KX(p - DX), LY = KY(p - DY).

For (C0,L0) as described above, the natural map ([\ref=kappa]) is surjective.

Case (1). Let [formula], [formula].

If l even, L2X = K2X(2p - 2DX) = M2X( - (l + 2)p). By lemma [\ref=lemma5.3], LX satisfies ([\ref=4.1]). L2Y( - p) = K2Y(p - 2DY) = M2Y( - (l + 1)p), LY satisfies ([\ref=4.2]).

If l odd, L2X = K2X(2p - 2DX) = M2X( - (l + 1)p), LX satisfies ([\ref=4.1]). L2Y( - p) = K2Y(p - DY) = M2Y( - (l + 2)p), thus LY satisfies ([\ref=4.2]) by lemma [\ref=lemma5.3].

Case (2). Let [formula], [formula].

If l even, L2Y = K2Y(2p - 2DY) = M2Y( - (l + 2)p), thus LY satisfies ([\ref=4.1]). L2X( - p) = K2X(p - 2DX) = M2X( - (l + 3)p) = M2X( - (gX + 2)p), LX satisfies ([\ref=4.2]).

If l odd, L2X = K2X(2p - 2DX) = M2X( - (l + 3)p) = M2X( - (gX + 2)p), LX satisfies ([\ref=4.1]). L2Y( - p) = K2Y(p - 2DY) = M2Y( - (l + 2)p)), LY satisfies ([\ref=4.2]).

Thus in either case, the hypotheses of lemma [\ref=tech] are satisfied, and therefore κ in ([\ref=kappa]) is surjective.

Combining proposition [\ref=hard], [\ref=harder] and theorem [\ref=new],

[formula]

is surjective for small [formula]. Since there is a unique component P of Wrd which dominate Mg (ρ > 0 case follows from the Gieseker-Petri theorem and the connectedness of Wrd(C); ρ = 0 case follows from [\cite=EH3]), to prove theorem [\ref=main_thm], it suffices to arrange so that (Ct,Lt)∈P. But this is immediate because C0 is a general point of the boundary of [formula].

some facts about canonical bundles on general curves

We present some technical facts about canonical bundles for a general curve in this section. They are needed in the proof of the main theorem. Lemma [\ref=lemma5.1] to [\ref=lemma5.3] are used in the previous section to show that maps of the type of ([\ref=4.1]) and ([\ref=4.2]) are surjective for the specific L0 we choose in section 4.

For a general smooth curve X of genus [formula], and p∈X a general point (in particular,not a Weierstrass point), the natural map

[formula]

is surjective and

[formula]

is of corank at most 1.

Choose {ω0,...,ωl - 1} a basis of H0(KX) adapted to the flag [formula], i.e. H0(KX( - ip)) = span{ωi,...,ωl - 1} for any i. By generality of X and p, we can assume KX( - (l - 2)p) is a base point free pencil. By base point free pencil trick, the kernel of the map

[formula]

is [formula]. By Riemann-Roch, h0(OX(l - 2)p) = h0(KX( - (l - 2)p)) + l - 2 - l + 1 = 1. Thus, by dimension count, m' is surjective with a one dimension kernel generated by [formula]. We obtain a basis of H0(K2X( - (l - 2)p):

[formula]

Except ωl - 2ω0, every other element of the above basis lies in the image of ml - 1, thus ml - 1 is surjective. Similarly, except ωl - 2ω0, ωl - 1ω0, ωl - 2ω1, every other element of the above basis lies in the image of ml. Therefore, ml is of corank at most 1.

For a general curve X of genus [formula], and p∈X a general point, ml in lemma [\ref=lemma5.1] is surjective.

It suffices to find some (X,p) for which ml is surjective. Take a special (X,p) such that KX( - (l - 2)p) is a pencil with a base point q  ≠  p and that q is not a base point of KX( - (l - 3)p). This is equivalent to find a X and p, q∈X such that h0(OX((l - 2)p + q)) = 2 and h0(OX((l - 3)p + q) = h0(OX((l - 2)p)) = 1. One can actually choose X to be a general point of Ml (but (X,p) is not general in Ml,1). This is because by theorem [\ref=movex], there exists a g1l - 1 on a general curves X with vanishing sequence (0,l - 2) at some point p∈X, and by theorem [\ref=movnonex], such a g1l - 1 is base point free, complete and its residual series has a unique base point q. For such (X,p), any element in

[formula]

vanishes at q. Now, take ωl - 3∈H0(KX( - (l - 3)p)) which does not vanish at q, then ω2l - 3 is in the image of ml but does not lie in V. It remains to show for this special (X,p), V is still of codimension 1 in H0(K2X( - lp)). Since KX( - (l - 2)p) has a unique base point q, by base point free pencil trick, the kernel of m' in ([\ref=m']) is isomorphic to H0(OX((l - 2)p + q))), which is 2 dimensional. By dimension count, m' is corank 1, and there is exactly 1 linear relation among the generators in ([\ref=basis]). Let τ∈H0(OX((l - 2)p + q)) be a section viewed as a rational function having a pole of order exactly l - 2 at p and a pole of order 1 at q, then the kernel of m' is spanned by

[formula]

and

[formula]

Where {ωl - 2,ωl - 1} span H0(KX( - (l - 2)p)). Since a general curve only has normal Weierstrass points, h0(KX( - (l - 1)p) = 1. We can assume ωl - 2 vanishes to order exactly l - 2 at p. Thus τωl - 2∈H0(KX) does not vanish at p, and the linear relation between the generators in ([\ref=basis]) will have non-zero coefficient in ωl - 1ω0. Thus

[formula]

are still linearly independent, and therefore V is still of codimension 1 in H0(K2X( - lp)).

Let X be a general curve of genus [formula], D is a divisor of degree 0 < d < l - 2 consisting of d distinct general points, p∈X is a general point. Let M = KX( - D + (d + 2)p). Then the multiplication maps

[formula]

and

[formula]

are both surjective.

The idea is similar to the previous two lemmata. We have deg  M = 2l, h0(M) = l + 1 and M( - lp) = KX( - D + (d + 2 - l)p) is a base point free pencil since p is general. Consider

[formula]

By base point free pencil trick, [formula] is isomorphic to H0(OX(lp)) and is 1 dimensional since p is not a Weierstrass point of X. Since h0(M2( - lp)) = 2l + 1, by dimension count, m' is surjective. Extend a basis {ωl, ωl + 1} of H0(M( - lp)) to a basis of H0(M):

[formula]

with each ωi vanish to order exactly i at p. The gap d + 1 occurs because h0(M( - (d + 1)p) = h0(KX( - D + p)) = h0(M( - (d + 2)p). By the same argument as lemma [\ref=lemma5.1], ([\ref=easy]) is surjective and ([\ref=diff]) is at most corank 1.

To prove that ([\ref=diff]) is actually surjective for general (X,D,p), we specialize to some (X,D,p) such that M( - lp) is a pencil with a base point q but q is not a base point of M( - (l - 1)p). This is equivalent to h0(M( - lp - q)) = h0(M( - lp)) = 2 or equivalently h0(OX(D + q + (l - d - 2)p)) = 2 and h0(OX(D + (l - d - 2)p)) = 1. We can even choose (X,p) be a general point of Ml,1. This is because by the existence half of theorem [\ref=fixex] (or by [\cite=O]), there exists a g1l - 1 with ramification sequence (0,l - d - 2) at p, and by the second half of theorem [\ref=fixex], a general such g1l - 1 is base point free, complete, and its residual series has a unique base point q. Then, as in lemma [\ref=lemma5.2], ω2l - 1 is in the image of ([\ref=diff]) but not in

[formula]

It remains to prove for this special (X,D,p), V is still of codimension 1 in H0(M2( - (l + 2)p)). The problem here is that due to the base point q of M( - lp), [formula] is isomorphic to H0(OX((lp + q)), which is 2 dimensional (because p is not a Weierstrass point). Thus m' is not surjective but corank 1. However, if H0(OX(ip + q)) is span by {1,τ} with τ a rational function having pole of order exactly l at p, then [formula] is spanned by

[formula]

and

[formula]

Again by theorem [\ref=fixex], we can even assume h0(M( - (l + 1)p)) = 1, and therefore can assume ml vanishes to order exactly l at p. Thus τωl does not vanish at p and by the same argument as lemma [\ref=lemma5.2], V is still of codimension 1 in H0(M2( - (l + 2)p)).

For the convenience of the reader, we state here some existence and non-existence results in Brill-Noether theory which we used in the proof of Lemma [\ref=lemma5.2] and [\ref=lemma5.3].

(Brill-Noether theorem, fixed ramification point) Let X be a general curve of genus g, p∈X a fixed general point. For any sequence 0  ≤  m0 < ... < mr  ≤  d, let ρ be the adjusted Brill-Noether number

[formula]

and let ρ+ be the existence number

[formula]

If ρ+ is nonnegative, then X possesses grd's with vanishing sequence (m0,..,mr) at p. Moreover, the variety Grd(m0,...,mr) parametrizing such grd's is empty if ρ < 0 and has pure dimension ρ if ρ > 0.

For the existence half, see [\cite=L] theorem 3.2-1. For the second half, see [\cite=HM] theorem 5.37.

(Non-existence for low ρmov)

Let X be a general curve of genus g, ρmov be the moving-point Brill-Noether number

[formula]

If ρmov < 1 - r, then for any p∈X, there is no grd on X with vanishing sequence (m0,...,mr) at p.

See [\cite=L] theorem 4.3-6.

(Existence of g1d's with movable ramification point)

Let X be a general curve of genus g, fix 0 < m1  ≤  d, then there exists a g1d on X with vanishing sequence (0,m1) at some point p∈X if [formula] and the moving-point Brill-Noether number [formula].

appendix

We give a special treatment for the case of genus 10 curves C and a complete g412 |L| on C. We include this case here because it does not follow from the general discuss in section 4 (we need [formula] in lemma [\ref=lemma5.2]) and there is very interesting geometry behind this example.

Since ρ = g - (r + 1)(g - d + r) = 0 in this case, by Brill-Noether Theorem, a general genus 10 curve C has only finitely many g412s, and each g412 on C is very ample. It is also known that for general such C, there exists some g412 |L| such that μ2 is not injective, i.e. C is contained in some quadric hypersurface in [formula] under the embedding of |L|, if and only if C is contained in some K3 surface (see [\cite=FP]). By proposition 2.2 of [\cite=CU], the locus K in M10 consisting of curves contained in some K3 surface is a divisor. (Interestingly, Farkas and Popa [\cite=FP] proved that K is a counter example for the slope conjecture.) Thus, for a general genus 10 curve C, and any g412 |L| on C, the multiplication map μ2 is injective (therefore an isomorphism, since the domain and range of μ2 are of the same dimension).

Here we will use the results in the previous section to give a proof of this fact without using the geometry of curves contained in K3 surfaces.

Notation the same as theorem [\ref=new]. Take X and Y both general curves of genus 5 meeting at a general point p. Take LX = KX( - 2p) = g26, LY = KY( - 2p) (which is smoothable). We will check κ in ([\ref=kappa]) is surjective. Consider the following exact sequence of sheaves:

[formula]

Where [formula] is the map given by the linear series |L0|. [formula] is the image of π consisting of two degree 6 plane curves with 5 nodes, and [formula] is the skyscraper sheaf of rank 10 supported on the five nodes of X' and five nodes on Y'.

Taking the long exact cohomology sequence, we obtain

[formula]

From the above exact sequence we see that a section s∈H0(L20) is not coming from pull back of [formula] if and only if φ(s) is not zero in [formula], i.e. s separate at least one node on C0'.

Now, choose σi sections of L1, σj sections of L- 1 according to their value at the inverse image under π of the ten nodes on C0' as table 1 below. Where i = 0,1, j = 2,3, pk', pk'' (resp. qk', qk'') are points in X (resp. Y) which gets mapped to the node pk (resp. qk) on X' (resp. Y'). Here it suffices to consider two nodes on each component, say k = 1,2. Cross means that σi does not vanish at the corresponding point, 0 means vanishing. For instance, σ0 is a section of L1, such that σ0|X is a section of the g37 = KX( - p) on X that vanish on p1'' and p2'' but not on p1' or p2' (Although the g26 = KX( - 2p) does not separate p1', p1'' or p2', p2'', the g37 does). σ0|Y is a section of the g15 = KY( - 3p) on Y that vanishes on q1', q1'', but not on q2' or q2''. Similarly, for other σi. By the generality of X, Y and p, the assigned value in table 1 can be achieved.

Table 2 describes the difference of σiσj at pk', pk'' and qk', qk'' for k = 1,2.

From table 2, we get a matrix of rank at least 3. Thus, [formula] is mapped under φ to a subspace of dimension at least 3 in [formula]. In other words, we have shown that Ct for [formula] is contained in at most one quadric in [formula].

It remains to show that we get an extra dimension from

[formula]

Choose λ1∈H0(L2), λ2∈H0(L- 2) according to table 3,

We get one more vector φ(λ1λ2) in [formula]. So we can add one row to the matrix in table 2, to get table 4

To show the matrix in table 4 has rank 4, it suffices to show that the first row and the last row can be chosen linearly independently, or equivalently, that

[formula]

This can be easily achieved, for instance, as follows. Take X = Y and X, Y meeting at the same point p∈X = Y and q1 = p3, q2 = p2. Choose σ0|X  =  σ2|Y, σ0|Y  =  σ2|X λ1|X  =  λ2|Y and λ1|Y  =  λ2|X as the unique (up to scalar) sections satisfying the conditions in table 5:

Then

[formula]

as rational functions, but since everything is general,

[formula]

In conclusion, we can arrange so that the rank of the matrix in table 4 is exactly 4 and therefore the image in [formula] of a general genus 10 curve under a general (thus every) g412 is not contained in any quadric.

For g > 10, a general curve in [formula] with degree [formula] is not contained in any quadric.

Consider the curve consists of a general curve X of genus 10 and a general curve Y of genus g - 10 meeting at a general point p. Consider the limit linear series with aspects VX = (d - 12)p + |g412|, VY = 8p + |g4d - 8|. Since everything is general, VX has vanishing sequence (8,9,10,11,12) at p, and VY has vanishing sequence (d - 12,d - 11,...,d - 8). Since limit g4d on [formula] with the above specified vanishing sequence have dimension ρ(g - 10,4,d - 8) + ρ(10,4,12) = (g - 10) - 5(g - 10 - (d - 8) + 4) + 0 = g - 5(g - d + 4) = ρ(g,4,d), by the smoothing theorem of limit linear series (see [\cite=EH1]), VX, VY are smoothable. On the other hand, the image of X in [formula] under φVX is not contained in any quadric and VX|Y is a |g0d - 12|. Thus, by degenerating to such limit g412 on [formula], we have our conclusion.
