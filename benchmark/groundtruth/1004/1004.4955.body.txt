On limiting cluster size distributions for processes of exceedances for stationary sequences

Let {Xk}k  ≥  0 be a stationary discrete time real-valued process. For a suitably chosen increasing real sequence {un}, consider the time-scaled point process of exceedances

[formula]

As is well known (see e.g. Corollary 3.3 and Theorem 4.1 in [\cite=HsHuLe] and also [\cite=Ro]), under broad assumptions, if the process Nn has a limit as n  →    ∞  , the latter must be a compound Poisson process, with some compounding law G = {gk}k  ≥  1 on [formula]. An example of an important class of processes for which G is non-trivial can be found e.g. in [\cite=BoLa] (Scenario 4.3): in the case of asymptotically homogeneous Markov chains, G will be geometric.

The main objective of this short note is to complete the characterization of the class of limiting distributions for [\eqref=PP] by giving an affirmative answer to the following natural question: Given an arbitrary distribution G on [formula], does there exist a stationary process [formula] for which G will be the cluster size distribution for the limiting point process of exceedances? This is achieved by constructing a two-dimensional stationary Markov chain (essentially, a regenerative process), then taking [formula] to be the component process of the chain and applying to it results from [\cite=Ro]. While in the case of a finite mean

[formula]

this task is next to trivial, the case μ  =    ∞   is more interesting and is, in our opinion, worth presenting.

For any distribution G on [formula] there exists a stationary process [formula] for which the time-scaled point process of exceedances [\eqref=PP] converges, for a suitably chosen [formula], to a compound Poisson process with compounding law G.

Proof. Without loss of generality, we can assume that

[formula]

In the case when μ  <    ∞  , the construction is straightforward: it will be a regenerative process staying at randomly chosen levels during regeneration cycles of random lengths distributed according to G, the heights of the levels and the lengths of the cycles forming independent i.i.d. sequences. Then exceedances of a high level will automatically be clustered, with cluster size distributed almost as ζ since it is quite unlikely to have two cycles with large heights one after another.

More formally, let {Yk}k  ≥  1 be an i.i.d. sequence of random variables that are, say, exponentially distributed with mean one, and let {τk}k  ≥  1 be a sequence of independent random variables which is independent of [formula] and such that

[formula]

Putting [formula] we see that

[formula]

is a (delayed) stationary renewal process, with a linear renewal function:

[formula]

(see e.g. Section 9.2 in [\cite=Bo]). Therefore the process

[formula]

will also be stationary: [formula] for any l  ≥  1, which immediately follows from the independence of the sequences [formula] and [formula] and the well-known fact that, for any l  ≥  1, one has [formula].

The process [formula] is clearly regenerative in the sense of [\cite=Ro], with i.i.d. cycles Ck: = {XSk - 1 + j:  0  ≤  j < Sk  -  Sk - 1}, k > 1. It is obvious that, for the number of exceedances of [formula] of the level un during the cycle Ck defined as

[formula]

one has

[formula]

and so

[formula]

Now it follows immediately from Theorem 3.3 in [\cite=Ro] that G will be the asymptotic distribution of the exceedances cluster size.

Now turn to the case μ  =    ∞  . The simple construction presented above won't work in this case as the regeneration cycles will have infinite mean lengths, but it can be modified by making the components of the random vectors (τk,Yk), k > 1, dependent of each other in such a way that (i) the conditional distribution of τk given Yk = y converges to G as y  →    ∞   (as we are interested in exceedances of high levels after all, we need to control the cycle length law only when there is an exceedance inside the cycle) and (ii) [formula]. Observe that a different regenerative process with the cycle length distribution depending on the level height was used in [\cite=Sm] to give a counterexample concerning the interpretation of the extremal index, see Remark 2 below.

To construct our version of the modified regenerative process, consider an i.i.d. sequence {(ζk,Yk)}k  ≥  2 of random vectors with independent components, [formula], Yk being exponential random variables with unit mean, and let [formula] k  ≥  2, where, as usual, [formula].

Thus defined i.i.d. random variables τk will have the distribution

[formula]

where

[formula]

with the mean

[formula]

Observe that, for v > 0

[formula]

Now we have to define (τ1,Y1) (assumed to be independent of {(τk,Yk)}k  ≥  2) in such a way that the process [\eqref=SPP] will again be stationary. It is obvious that, similarly to [\eqref=TA], τ1 should follow the distribution

[formula]

so we only need to specify how Y1 depends on τ1. Again, it's quite clear that the dependence should be the same as one has in the limit (as k  →    ∞  ) between Yη(k) and the overshot Sη(k) - k. As the length τη(k) of the renewal interval 'covering' the point k is, loosely speaking, greater than that of a 'typical' τ, our construction implies that Yη(k) should also be greater than a 'typical' Y (and, in particular, cannot have the same distribution as Y2, cf. [\eqref=Y1]). The above informal argument leads to the following construction.

Denote by

[formula]

the defect and excess of the level k in the random walk [formula], respectively. As is well known (recall [\eqref=1] and see e.g. Section 9.3 in [\cite=Bo]),

[formula]

Now consider a random vector (γ,χ,V) assuming that its first two components are integer-valued and such that [formula] is given by the RHS of [\eqref=GX] (note that the distribution of χ will coincide with that of τ1 from [\eqref=TAt]), whereas

[formula]

Finally, we set

[formula]

and again consider the process [formula] defined by [\eqref=SPP].

It is obvious from the construction that, to prove that [formula] is stationary, it suffices to show that, for any l  ≥  1, j  ≥  1, m  ≥  1 and v > 0, one has

[formula]

To do that, we first observe that

[formula]

from [\eqref=TauCon]. Now, for the LHS of [\eqref=LR], we have

[formula]

where we used [\eqref=LRa] to evaluate the first term on the RHS of the first line. The inner sum in the last line of [\eqref=XA], using the first relation in [\eqref=RF] and [\eqref=TauCon], is equal to

[formula]

Substituting these expressions into the RHS of [\eqref=XA] yields

[formula]

which coincides with the RHS of [\eqref=LRa] thus proving the desired stationarity of [formula].

It remains to observe that our process [formula] is again regenerative, with the finite mean cycle length ν, that [\eqref=GS-] still holds for it, and that, instead of [\eqref=GS], we now have

[formula]

Clearly, [formula] as n  →    ∞  , and so condition (3.9) of Theorem 3.3 in [\cite=Ro] will be satisfied. Therefore the claim of the theorem will hold in this case as well, showing that G = {gj} will emerge as the asymptotic distribution for the size of clusters of exceedances. Theorem 1 is proved.

[formula]

Remark 1 Observe that it follows from [\eqref=LRa] and [\eqref=Tau2Mean] that

[formula]

As, due to stationarity [formula] for any k  ≥  1, the above implies that the distribution of Xk in our stationary process is given by

[formula]

Remark 2 Recall that, under broad assumptions, the limiting distributional type for the maxima in a stationary sequence coincides with that for the maxima of i.i.d. random variables with the same marginal distribution, and that the changes brought by dependence can often be characterized by the so-called "extremal index" of the stationary sequence (see e.g. Section 2 in [\cite=LeRo] and further references therein, and also [\cite=No]). For a sequence [formula], set [formula], and let [formula] be an i.i.d. sequence with [formula] As it is well known (see e.g. Lemma 1.2.2 in [\cite=LeRo]), for a sequence of constants [formula] and λ∈[0,   ∞ ], one has [formula] as n  →    ∞   iff

[formula]

It turns out that, in many cases (originally it was noted for strongly mixing sequences in [\cite=Lo]), if [\eqref=Mo] holds then one also has

[formula]

for a some fixed value θ∈[0,1] which is referred to as the extremal index of the sequence [formula].

Alternatively, the extremal index can be characterized by the fact that 1 / θ is the limiting mean cluster size in the sequence of point processes [\eqref=PP] of exceedances over high levels, as it was shown under broad assumptions in [\cite=HsHuLe]; a counterexample showing that this interpretation of θ is not necessarily correct was given in [\cite=Sm]. For the stationary sequences that we constructed in the proof of Theorem 1, the extremal index is equal to [formula] in both cases (θ = 0 when [formula]), which can easily be verified by a direct calculation.
