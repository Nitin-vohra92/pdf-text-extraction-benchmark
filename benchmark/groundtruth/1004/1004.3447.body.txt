Introduction

The problem of controllability of quantum systems in finite dimensions has been settled in many papers (see for example [\cite=Clark] [\cite=Ramakrishna] [\cite=Fu] [\cite=Altafini] [\cite=Turinici1] [\cite=Albertini]). In contrast, for infinite-dimensional quantum systems, a few questions are still open [\cite=Illner] [\cite=Tarn].

In the framework of bilinear control

[formula]

with [formula] and operators such that H0 generates a continuous semigroup and B is bounded, Turinici [\cite=Turinici2] has adapted a result of Ball-Marsden-Slemrod [\cite=Ball] to show that the set of reachable states from any [formula] has a dense complement in [formula], S being the Hilbert sphere and H2 the W2,2 Sobolev space. This is a very general result that applies whenever the operators in ([\ref=1.1]) generate a piecewise (in time) countable sequence of continuous evolution operators. Then, because continuous maps map compact sets into compact sets, the reachable set is a countable union of compact sets. In infinite-dimensional complete metric spaces, compact sets are nowhere dense hence, by Baire's theorem, the reachable set is a first category set with dense complement. Therefore exact bilinear controllability cannot be achieved in [formula].

Several ways may be devised to go beyond this result. Compactness is an internal property of sets but nowhere density is not, it depends on the ambient space. Therefore, for example in a higher regularity space, exact controllability might be achieved. This is the situation in the local controllability results [\cite=Beauchard1] [\cite=Beauchard2] in [formula]. Another, less explored possibility, would be to choose a control operator B that does not generate a continuous evolution operator.

However, what is really important from the physical point of view, is not exact but approximate controllability, that is, the possibility to approach any target state with arbitrary accuracy. In the bilinear control setting in [formula] this would correspond to prove that the reachable set is dense in [formula]. This is likely to happen because the closure of a first category set is not in general of first category. In fact, the closure of a linear set is of first category if and only if it is itself nowhere dense.

Results on approximate controllability in infinite dimensions already exist in particular cases or imposing some restrictions on the H0 and B operators or on their domains ([\cite=Nersesyan] [\cite=Mirrahimi] [\cite=Ervedoza] [\cite=Mason1] [\cite=Mason2]). For example, the exact controllability in the H7 Sobolev space for a 1D potential, in [\cite=Beauchard1] [\cite=Beauchard2], implies approximate controllability in L2. In [\cite=Mirrahimi] the spectrum is considered to have only finitely many discrete eigenvalues and in [\cite=Nersesyan] the domain must be bounded. In [\cite=Mason1] aproximate controllability requires the spectrum of H0 to be non-resonant and the potential B to couple directly or indirectly every pair of eigenvectors of H0. However these conditions were later shown [\cite=Mason2] to be generic in some sense.

Also, the authors in [\cite=Rangan] developed the notion of finitely controllable infinite dimensional systems. They consider a nested set of finite-dimensional subspaces of Hilbert space of which the smallest one is controllable and in each subspace Hα acts a set Gα of operators such that any orbit generated by [formula] contains a vector in a lower dimensional subspace. Then they prove that any vector in one of the finite-dimensional subspaces may be mapped into any other vector in another finite-dimensional subspace. This is a powerful result with practical applications but is not infinite-dimensional controllability. The subtlety of this difference is related to the fact that G∞   (Eq.[\ref=3.5]) is a proper subgroup of the infinite-dimensional unitary group (see Sect.3 for details).

Here we follow a different approach. That approximate controllability is possible in S had already been proved in [\cite=Vilela1] by the explicit construction of a small set of unitary operators that, operating in any ψ0∈S, reach an arbitrarily small neighborhood of any target state ψ. This result has been later generalized to open quantum systems [\cite=Vilela2]. However, this does no settle the question of approximate bilinear controllability because it is not obvious that the unitary operators used in [\cite=Vilela1] can be generated in the setting of Eq.([\ref=1.1]).

This is one of purposes of this paper, namely to show that, given any initial and target states [formula] and an approximation accuracy δ, it is possible to generate by bilinear control the required evolution. Use will be made of the results in Ref.[\cite=Vilela1], which allows to prove infinite-dimensional controllability with very mild conditions on the free Hamiltonian H0. Approximations of the shift operator play an important role in this construction. Why the shift operator or some other essentially infinite dimensional operator is essential for control in infinite dimensions is related to the properties of the infinite dimensional unitary group. This is explained in detail in Section 3 and an alternative representation of the shift operator is also described. The role of essentially infinite dimension operators in the controllability results may also shed some light on the nature of the operator conditions used in past attempts to prove approximate controllability in infinite dimensions.

Approximate bilinear control in infinite dimensions

The set of operators that in [\cite=Vilela1] were shown to implement approximate controllability in infinite dimensions are the operators of an [formula] group and the shift operator. By the choice of a countable basis, any separable Hilbert space is shown to be isomorphic to [formula], the space of double-infinite square-integrable sequences

[formula]

[formula], with basis It was in this setting that the results in [\cite=Vilela1] were derived, the shift operator U+ being

[formula]

with inverse

[formula]

and the [formula] group operating in the linear space spanned by e0 and e1 and leaving the complementary space unchanged. It was then shown that once an initial and target states [formula] and an accuracy δ are defined, one may, by the application of these operators go, in a finite number of steps, from ψ0 to a ψn such that [formula].

In the space of double infinite sequences, one may choose a representation Hilbert space L2(0,2π), the domain of the operators H0 and B beingThenand the shift operator is

[formula]

Using this background knowledge we now prove:

Proposition: Approximate bilinear quantum control, with H0 generating a strongly continuous semigroup and bounded control operators B, is possible in infinite dimensions. That is, the reachable set is dense in [formula].

The proof proceeds by showing that the [formula] and the shift operators may be approximated with arbitrary precision by bounded operators in the bilinear control context.

Let [formula] be the finite set of [formula] and shift operators that take ψ0 to a state ψn through a sequence of states [formula] such that [formula]. Now, considering another set of approximating operators [formula], and defining [formula], we have the following estimate

[formula]

The generator θ of the shift operator ([\ref=2.4]) is not an operator in D but it can be approximated by bounded operators in D. Consider the following family of bounded operators in D

[formula]

and, for an arbitrary normalized state [formula] in L2(0,2π), compute

[formula]

The argument of the cosine in the last term is a Fourier series remainder which, for θ  ≠  2π, may be made as small as desired by choosing a sufficiently large p. Because the inequality does not depend on φ we obtain a norm estimate

[formula]

for arbitrarily small [formula].

Now, if H0 generates a strongly continuous semigroup, [formula] with [formula] and [formula] bounded, is also the generator of a strongly continuous semigroup [\cite=perturb]. Thenfor any ψ, [formula] being as small as desired by a sufficiently small choice of Δt.

A similar reasoning applies to a control operator to add to H0 to approximate the [formula] transformations to precison [formula]. Now suppose that to reach ψn from the initial state ψ0 one needs L applications of the shift operator and N [formula] transformations. Then choosing [formula], [formula] and [formula] such that one concludes from ([\ref=2.3a]) that the desired control precision is obtained. This completes the proof.

The shift operator and the infinite dimensional unitary group

In the proof of approximate controllability in infinite dimensions in [\cite=Vilela1], the shift operator played an important role. Of course, the choice of operators implementing quantum control in infinite dimensions is not unique, but the fact that an operator with properties similar to the shift is needed reflects the special features of the infinite-dimensional unitary group. The infinite dimensional unitary and orthogonal groups, [formula] and [formula], are clearly transitive in complex and real infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. Therefore the operators that implement control in infinite dimensions must somehow be able to generate these groups. The suitable mathematical setting for the groups [formula] or [formula] is a Gelfand triplet

[formula]

E being a nuclear space obtained as the limit of a sequence of Hilbert spaces with successively larger norms. An element g of [formula] is a transformation in E such that

[formula]

By duality [formula], [formula], the infinite-dimensional unitary group is also defined on [formula], the two groups being algebraically isomorphic.

For the harmonic analysis on [formula] one needs functionals on [formula]. [formula] is a complexification of [formula] and a standard result states that if a measure μ is invariant under [formula] it must be of the form a sum of a delta and Gaussian measures μσ with variance σ2. Hence we are led to consider the [formula] space of functionals on [formula] with a [formula]invariant Gaussian measure B being generated by the cylinder sets in [formula] and μ the measure with characteristic functional

In conclusion: the proper framework to study transitive actions and functional analysis in infinite dimensional quantum spaces is the complex white noise setting [\cite=Hida1]. In this context many useful results are already available. For example, the regular representation of [formula]splits into irreducible representations [\cite=Okamoto] corresponding to the Fock space (chaos expansion) decomposition of [formula]Hn - k,k being a complex Fourier-Hermite polynomial of degree [formula] in [formula] and of degree k in [formula]

Furthermore, results concerning a classification of the subgroups of [formula] are useful to understand the requirements of quantum control in infinite dimensions. In particular one must distinguish between subgroups that only involve transformations that may be approximated by finite-dimensional transformations like G∞  , obtained as the limit of a sequence of finite-dimensional unitary groups

[formula]

[formula]

from those that contain transformations changing, in a significant way, infinitely many coordinates. These group elements are called essentially infinite-dimensional (see the section 4 for a definition). The essential point to remember is that to generate [formula], and therefore to be transitive in infinite dimensions, some essentially infinite dimensional elements are needed. This is why the shift operator or some other essentially infinite-dimensional operation is required for control in [formula].

In our mathematical construction we have represented a separable Hilbert as a space of double-infinite sequences. Given the importance of essentially infinite-dimensional operators for the quantum control in [formula] we include in the next section an implementation of the shift operator in an oscillator-like basis, which may be closer to the usual physical applications.

The shift operator in an oscillator-like basis

In the Gelfand triplet settingwith the white noise measure μ in [formula], choose an orthonormal basis in EIn this basis one has the usual raising and lowering operators a+ and a and define the operators

[formula]

that is, A+  =   [formula] and [formula].

The projection operator P0 on the basis state ξ0 isand in any other state ξn isThe elementary operator Pjk that transforms ξk into ξj isand one also define the following parity operatorsNow the operatorplays the same role as the shift operator in the space of double-infinite square-integrable sequences, as may easily be seen by the appropriate renumbering of a double infinite sequence. Notice that this operator is different from the resonant driving field [formula], used in the discussions of controllability of the harmonic oscillator [\cite=Kime]  [\cite=Rouchon], which together with free Hamiltonian generates a four-dimensional Lie algebra. U+ together with an [formula] group acting in the subspace [formula] generates an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra and controllability in infinite dimensions is obtained. U+ is an essentially infinite dimensional operator. This notion is rigorously defined through the average power [\cite=Hida1], that is,[formula]. If [formula] for an operator U is positive almost surely for the measure μ in [formula], the operator is called essentially infinite-dimensional. Qualitatively it means that it acts, in a significant way, in infinitely many coordinates. In the opposite case, if [formula] almost surely, then U may be approximated by transformations acting on finite dimensional subspaces. The average power of U+ is 2 almost surely.

Other essentially infinite-dimensional operators may be obtained by constructions similar to the one used for U+. As follows from the nature of the infinite-dimensional unitary group, at least one such operator (or an arbitrarily close approximation there of) is needed to obtain density in [formula].

Conclusions

In addition to establishingh that under mild conditions the closure of the reachable set of bilinear control is dense in [formula], we have also put in evidence the special role of essentially infinite-dimensional operators in quantum control.

The central role here was played by the shift operator and approximations thereof. This is an operator that behaves like the application of a magnetic field pulse to a charged particle in a circle (a charged plane rotator), which shifts the eigenstates one level up. Other simple essentially infinite-dimensional operators are described in Ref.[\cite=Hida1], which may be used as a guide to develop control methodologies for infinite-dimensional quantum systems.
