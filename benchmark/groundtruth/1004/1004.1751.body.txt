Limit sets and commensurability of Kleinian groups

Introduction

Two groups G1 and G2 are commensurable if their intersection [formula] is of finite index in both G1 and G2. In this paper, we investigate the following question asked by J. Anderson [\cite=bm]: namely, if [formula] are finitely generated and discrete, does [formula] imply that G1 and G2 are commensurable? Here we use [formula] to denote the set of axes of the hyperbolic elements of [formula].

The question has been discussed by several authors. In 1990, G. Mess [\cite=gm] showed that if G1 and G2 are non-elementary finitely generated Fuchsian groups having the same nonempty set of simple axes, then G1 and G2 are commensurable. Using some technical results on arithmetic Kleinian groups, D. Long and A. Reid [\cite=da] gave an affirmative answer to this question in the case where G1 and G2 are arithmetic Kleinian groups. Note that all the confirmed cases for the question are geometrically finite groups. So it is natural to ask if the question is true with the assumption that G1 and G2 are geometrically finite. Recently, P. Susskind [\cite=ps] constructed two geometrically finite Kleinian groups in [formula] (for n  ≥  4) having the same action on some invariant 2-hyperbolic plane but whose intersection is infinitely generated. So this implies that these two geometrically finite groups are not commensurable although they have the same axes set. But it is worth pointing that these two geometrically finite Kleinian groups generate a non-discrete group. This example suggests that some additional conditions need to be imposed to eliminate such 'bad' groups.

In higher dimensions, we have the following consequence of P. Susskind and G. Swarup's results [\cite=ss] on the limit set of the intersection of two geometrically finite Kleinian groups.

Let G1 and G2 be two non-elementary geometrically finite subgroups of a Kleinian group [formula]. Then G1 and G2 are commensurable if and only if the limit sets Λ(G1) and Λ(G2) are equal. In particular, Λ(G1)  =  Λ(G2) if and only if [formula].

In several cases, the condition that both subgroups lie in a larger discrete group can be dropped.

Let [formula] be two non-elementary geometrically finite Kleinian groups of the second kind leaving no m hyperbolic planes invariant for m  <  n - 1. Then G1 and G2 are commensurable if and only if Λ(G1)  =  Λ(G2).

In dimension 3, we can refine the analysis of the limit sets using Anderson's results [\cite=aj2] to get the following result in the essence of the recent solution of the Tameness Conjecture (see [\cite=ag] and [\cite=cag]) which states that all finitely generated Kleinian groups in [formula] are topologically tame.

Let G1, G2 be two non-elementary finitely generated subgroups of an infinite co-volume Kleinian group [formula]. Then G1 and G2 are commensurable if and only if Λ(G1)  =  Λ(G2). In particular, Λ(G1)  =  Λ(G2) if and only if [formula]

Similarly, in the following case we are able to remove the ambient discrete group.

Let [formula] be two non-elementary finitely generated Kleinian groups of the second kind whose limit sets are not circles. Then G1 and G2 are commensurable if and only if Λ(G1)  =  Λ(G2).

In fact, under the hypotheses of the above results, the condition of having the same limit sets of two Kleinian subgroups exactly implies having the same axes sets. But Anderson's original formulation of the question is only to suppose that two Kleinian groups have the same axes set. So it is interesting to explore whether there is some essential difference between the limit set and axes set. The following theorem is a result in this direction, suggesting that the 'same axes set' condition is necessary in general for Anderson's question.

Let H be a non-elementary finitely generated subgroup of a Kleinian group [formula]. Suppose that Λ(H)  =  Λ(G). Then

[formula]

is finite if and only if [formula].

We remark that the case of H being geometrically finite is proved by P. Susskind and G. Swarup [\cite=ss]. Theorem [\ref=thm:axes] actually proves the special case of Anderson's question where G1 is a subgroup of G2.

The paper is organized as follows. In section [\ref=sec:2], we collect some results on the limit set of the intersection of two Kleinian groups and prove some useful lemmas for later use. In section [\ref=sec:3], we prove Theorems [\ref=thm:tamecomm] and [\ref=thm:axes].

Preliminaries

Let n denote the closed ball [formula], whose boundary [formula] is identified via stereographic projection with [formula]. Let [formula] be the full group of isometries of [formula] and let [formula] be a Kleinian group; that is, a discrete subgroup of [formula]. Then G acts discontinuously on [formula] if and only if G is discrete. Furthermore, G acts on [formula] as a group of conformal homeomorphisms. The set of discontinuity Ω(G) of G is the subset of [formula] on which G acts discontinuously; the limit set Λ(G) is the complement of Ω(G) in [formula]. A Kleinian group is said to be of the second kind if Ω(G) is nonempty otherwise it is said to be of the first kind.

The elements of [formula] are classified in terms of their fixed point sets. An element [formula] in [formula] is [formula] if it has a fixed point in [formula], parabolic if it has exactly one fixed point which lies in [formula], hyperbolic if it has exactly two fixed points which lie in [formula]. The unique geodesic joining the two fixed points of the hyperbolic element g, which is invariant under g, is called the axis of the hyperbolic element and is denoted by [formula]. The limit set Λ(G) is the closure of the set of fixed points of hyperbolic and parabolic elements of G. A Kleinian group whose limit set contains fewer than three points is called [formula] and is otherwise called [formula].

For a non-elementary Kleinian group G, define [formula] to be the smallest nonempty convex set in [formula] which is invariant under the action of G; this is the convex hull of Λ(G). The quotient [formula] is the convex core of [formula]. The group G is geometrically finite if the convex core C(G) has finite volume.

By Margulis's lemma, it is known that there is a positive constant ε0 such that for any Kleinian group [formula] and ε  <  ε0, the part of [formula] where the injectivity radius is less than ε is a disjoint union of tubular neighbourhoods of closed geodesics, whose lengths are less than 2ε, and cusp neighbourhoods. In dimensions 2 and 3, these cusp neighbourhoods can be taken to be disjoint quotients of horoballs by the corresponding parabolic subgroup. This set of disjoint horoballs is called a precisely invariant system of horoballs for G. In dimension 3, it is often helpful to identify the infinity boundary [formula] of [formula] with the extended complex plane [formula]. In particular, the fixed point of a rank 1 parabolic subgroup J of G is called [formula] if there are two disjoint circular discs B1, [formula] such that [formula] is precisely invariant under J in G. In this case, the parabolic elements of J are also called doubly cusped.

In dimension 3, we call a Kleinian group G topologically tame if the manifold [formula] is homeomorphic to the interior of a compact 3-manifold. Denote by Mc the complement of these cusp neighbourhoods. Using the relative core theorem of McCullough [\cite=mc], there exists a compact submanifold N of Mc such that the inclusion of N in Mc is a homotopy equivalence, every torus component of ∂(Mc) lies in N, and N meets each annular component of ∂(Mc) in an annulus. Call such an N a relative compact core for M. The components of ∂(N)  -  ∂(Mc) are the relative boundary components of N. The ends of Mc are in one-to-one correspondence with the components of Mc - N. An end E of Mc is geometrically finite if it has a neighbourhood disjoint from C(G). Otherwise, E is geometrically infinite.

A Kleinian group [formula] is virtually fibered over a subgroup H if there are finite index subgroups G0 of G and H0 of H such that [formula] has finite volume and fibers over the circle with the fiber subgroup H0. Note that H0 is then a normal subgroup of G0, and so Λ(H0) = Λ(G0) = [formula].

In order to analyze the geometry of a geometrically infinite Kleinian group, we will use Canary's covering theorem, which generalizes a theorem of Thurston [\cite=thurston]. Note that the Tameness Theorem ([\cite=ag] and [\cite=cag]) states that all finitely generated Kleinian groups in [formula] are topologically tame.

Let G be a torsion free Kleinian group in [formula] and let H be a non-elementary finitely generated subgroup of G. Let [formula], let [formula], and let p:M  →  N be the covering map. If M has a geometrically infinite end E, then either G is virtually fibered over H or E has a neighbourhood U such that p is finite-to-one on U.

Now we list several results on the limit set of the intersection of two Kleinian groups, which describe [formula] in terms of Λ(G1) and Λ(G2), where G1 and G2 are subgroups of a Kleinian group G. Here we only collect the results used in this paper and state them in an appropriate form for our purpose. See [\cite=aj] for a useful survey and the bibliography therein for the results in full details.

Let G1, G2 be two geometrically finite subgroups of Kleinian group [formula]. Then [formula] where P consists of some parabolic fixed points of G1 and G2.

Let H be geometrically finite and j be a hyperbolic element with a fixed point in Λ(H). If 〈H,j〉 is discrete, then jn∈H for some n  >  0.

Based on the above results, we get the following lemma characterizing the relationship between limit sets and axes sets.

Let G1, G2 be two geometrically finite subgroups of Kleinian group [formula]. Then Λ(G1)  =  Λ(G2) if and only if [formula]

If G1 and G2 are geometrically finite subgroups of a Kleinian group G, then [formula] is again geometrically finite ([\cite=ss]). It is well known that a hyperbolic element cannot share one fixed point with a parabolic element in a discrete group. Thus by applying Theorem [\ref=thm:ss] to [formula], we can conclude that any hyperbolic element h∈Gi has at least one fixed point in [formula] for i = 1,2. Now by Proposition [\ref=prop:ss], we have [formula] for some large integer j > 0. This implies the axis [formula] of h belongs to [formula]. Therefore we have [formula] and it also follows that P is the empty set.

The other direction is easy to see using the fact that the set of fixed points of hyperbolic elements of G is dense in Λ(G).

In dimension 3, J. Anderson [\cite=aj2] carried out a more careful analysis on the limit set of the intersection of two topologically tame Kleinian groups. Combined with the recent solution of the Tameness Conjecture ([\cite=ag] and [\cite=cag]), we have the following theorem.

Let [formula] be a Kleinian group, and let G1 and G2 be non-elementary finitely generated subgroups of G, then [formula] where P is empty or consists of some parabolic fixed points of G1 and G2.

Let H be finitely generated Kleinian group and j be a hyperbolic element with a fixed point in Λ(H). If 〈H,j〉 is discrete, then either 〈H,j〉 is virtually fibered over H or jn∈H for some n  >  0.

Similarly, we obtain the following lemma.

Let G1 and G2 be two non-elementary finitely generated subgroups of an infinite co-volume Kleinian group [formula]. Then Λ(G1)  =  Λ(G2) if and only if [formula]

Observe that our hypothesis 'G is an infinite co-volume Kleinian group' implies that G is not virtually fibered over G1. Since the intersection of any pair of finitely generated subgroups of a Kleinian group is finitely generated (see [\cite=aj3]), we see that [formula] is finitely generated. Using Theorem [\ref=thm:an] and Proposition [\ref=prop:an], we can argue exactly as in Lemma [\ref=lem:geo] to obtain [formula], if we suppose Λ(G1)  =  Λ(G2).

The condition of G being infinite co-volume cannot be dropped, as will be seen in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:axes]. Namely, the Kleinian group G fibering over H has a different axes set from that of its fiber subgroup H.

In the following two lemmas, we give some useful properties about the same axes sets of two Kleinian groups.

Let G be a non-elementary finitely generated Kleinian group and H a subgroup of finite index in G. Then [formula].

It is obvious that [formula]. Conversely, since

[formula]

In fact, our Theorem [\ref=thm:axes] proves that the converse of the above Lemma is also true when H is a finitely generated subgroup of [formula].

Let G be a non-elementary finitely generated, torsion free Kleinian group and H be a subgroup of G. Suppose that [formula]. Then for every hyperbolic element g∈G, gn∈H for some n > 0.

For any hyperbolic element g∈G, we can choose a hyperbolic element h from H such that [formula] by the hypothesis [formula]. It follows that the subgroup 〈g,h〉 is elementary and torsion free. By the characterization of elementary Kleinian groups it follows that 〈g,h〉 is actually a cyclic subgroup 〈f〉 of G. Thus we can write g = fm and h = fn for two appropriate integers m, n. Now we have found the integer n such that gn  =  hm∈H, which proves the lemma.

Proofs

Recall G1 and G2 are commensurable if the intersection [formula] is of finite index in both G1 and G2. By Lemma [\ref=lem:finite], we have [formula] and thus Λ(G1) = Λ(G2), if G1 and G2 are commensurable. So it remains to prove the converse.

If Λ(G1) = Λ(G2), we have [formula] by Lemma [\ref=lem:geo]. Therefore it follows that [formula], since the set of fixed points of hyperbolic elements of G is dense in Λ(G). Now we can conclude that [formula] is of finite index in both G1 and G2, by using Theorem 1 in [\cite=ss] which states that any geometrically finite subgroup H of a Kleinian group G is of finite index in G if Λ(H) = Λ(G).

The second assertion is just Lemma [\ref=lem:geo]. This completes the proof.

It is well known that the stabilizer in [formula] of the limit set of a non-elementary Kleinian group G of the second kind leaving no m hyperbolic planes invariant for m  <  n - 1, is itself a Kleinian group. See for example Greenberg [\cite=lg], where the discreteness of the stabilizer of that limit set is proved.

Thus [formula] implies that G1 and G2 together lie in a common Kleinian group, which is the stabilizer of the common limit set of G1 and G2. Thus Proposition [\ref=prop:geocomm] completes the proof.

Observe that the fundamental domain of the subgroup H is the union of translates of the fundamental domain of G by left H-coset representatives in G. So the subgroup 〈G1,G2〉 also has infinite co-volume, and we can assume that G is finitely generated by replacing G by 〈G1,G2〉. As the conclusion is easily seen to be unaffected by passage to a finite index subgroup, we may use Selberg's Lemma to pass to a finite index, torsion free subgroup of G. Hence, without loss of generality, we may assume that G is finitely generated and torsion free.

By Proposition [\ref=prop:geocomm], the conclusion is trivial if G is geometrically finite. So we suppose that G is geometrically infinite. Then M  =  3 / G has infinite volume. Let C be a compact core for M. Since M has infinite volume, ∂C contains a surface of genus at least two. Then using Thurston's geometrization theorem for Haken three-manifolds (see [\cite=jm]), there exists a geometrically finite Kleinian group with non-empty discontinuity domain, which is isomorphic to G.

Now our task is to give an algebraic characterization of the limit set of [formula] in Gi such that the relationships between [formula] and Λ(Gi) can be passed to the ones between target isomorphic groups under the above isomorphism of G. Then the conclusion of Theorem [\ref=thm:tamecomm] follows from Proposition [\ref=prop:geocomm]. We claim that for every element g∈G1, there exists an integer k such that [formula].

Firstly, by Lemma [\ref=lem:tame], we obtain that [formula]. So for any hyperbolic element g∈G1, the integer k obtained in Lemma [\ref=lem:burnside] is such that [formula]. Now we consider the remaining parabolic elements. Theorem B of [\cite=aj2] says that if no nontrivial power of a parabolic element h∈G1 lies in [formula], then there exists a doubly cusped parabolic element [formula] with the same fixed point ξ as h. Normalizing their fixed point ξ to ∞  , we can suppose that f(z) = z + 1 and h(z) = z + τ, where [formula]. Since f is doubly cusped in [formula], then [formula], for some constant c. But on the other hand, [formula] is also kept invariant under h, which contradicts the fact that [formula] is invariant under f. Therefore the claim is proved for all elements including parabolic elements. A similar claim holds for [formula] and G2.

Under the isomorphism, using the above claims, we can conclude that the limit set of the (isomorphic) image of [formula] is equal to those of the (isomorphic) images of G1 and G2. The proof is complete as a consequence of Proposition [\ref=prop:geocomm].

Theorem [\ref=thm:tamecomm] can be thought as a geometric version of Lemma 5.4 in [\cite=aj2], which uses an algebraic assumption on the limit sets of the groups involved.

This is proved similarly to Corollary [\ref=cor:geocomm].

In view of Lemma [\ref=lem:finite], we may assume, without loss of generality, that H is finitely generated and torsion free by using Selberg's Lemma to pass to a finite index, torsion free subgroup of H.

If H is geometrically finite, then the conclusion follows from a result of P. Susskind and G. Swarup [\cite=ss], which states that a non-elementary geometrically finite subgroup sharing the same limit set with the ambient discrete group is of finite index. So next we suppose that H is geometrically infinite. Then there exist finitely many geometrically infinite ends Ei for the manifold N: = 3 / H.

We first claim that [formula] implies that H cannot be a virtually fiber subgroup of G. Otherwise, by taking finite index subgroups of G and H, we can suppose H is normal in G. Then it follows that every element of the quotient group G / H has finite order by Lemma [\ref=lem:burnside]. Thus G / H could not be isomorphic to [formula]. This is a contradiction. So H is not a virtually fiber subgroup of G.

Using the Covering Theorem [\ref=thm:covering], we know that for each geometrically infinite end Ei, there exists a neighbourhood Ui of Ei such that the covering map P: N  →  M:  =  3 / G is finite to one on Ui.

Now we argue by way of contradiction. Let QN:3  →  N and let QM:3  →  M be the covering maps and notice that [formula]. Suppose that
