Bounds for mixing time of quantum walks on finite graphs

Abstract

Introduction

The origin of the concept of quantum walk lies in quantum computation theory, where a quantum version of the classical random walk was invented in an attempt to improve over classical computational algorithms. The early papers that formulated the main ideas of quantum walk are [\cite=aharonov_davidovich_zagury93] and [\cite=meyer96]. Among numerous later papers, we would like to point out [\cite=farhi_gutmann98] where the continuous-time quantum walk was defined and [\cite=aharonov_ambainis_kempe_vazirani01] which defined and studied the discrete-time quantum walk on finite graphs. An introductory review of quantum walks written from the prospective of quantum computation can be found in [\cite=kempe03]. For recent developments the reader can also consult [\cite=konno08].

From the beginning, it became clear that quantum walks on both finite and infinite graphs have many differences from the classical walk. For example, the probability to find a particle at a particular vertex of a finite graph does not converge to a limit but in general oscillates forever. However, the average of this probability over time does converge to a limit, which can be interpreted as follows. We start quantum walk in a certain state and measure the particle at a random time t, which is distributed uniformly over interval [formula] This measurement finds the particle at a particular vertex v with a probability [formula] which converges to a limit as T  →    ∞  . How large should T be if we want to make sure that [formula] is close to its limit?

Let us introduce some definitions to make this question more precise.

The quantum walk on a finite graph is a 4-tuple [formula] where [formula] is a finite graph, S is a finite set, ψ is a function in [formula], and U is a unitary operator on [formula] It is assumed that [formula]. Elements of S are called chiralities and the function ψt = Utψ is the wave function at time [formula]. If a measurement is performed over the system at time t, then the walking particle is found at vertex v in state s with probability [formula]

We assume that the quantum walk is local. That is, let x and [formula] denote pairs [formula] and [formula] respectively. A quantum walk is local if [formula] implies that [formula] that is, vertices v and [formula] are connected to each other. A local quantum walk is called the general quantum walk in [\cite=aharonov_ambainis_kempe_vazirani01].

A special case of the general quantum walk is the coined quantum walk ([\cite=aharonov_ambainis_kempe_vazirani01]). Here is how it is defined. Let G be a d-regular graph and let [formula] Assume that the neighbors of each vertex v are labelled as vi where [formula] In addition, assume that if v  ≠  w and vi = wj then i  ≠  j. (Such a labelling L always exists on Cayley graphs of finitely-generated groups, where we can identify elements of S with generators and inverses of generators of the group and write vg = vg and vg- 1 = vg- 1. In this case the choice of labelling is equivalent to the choice of ordering of generators and their inverses.)

Define U as follows. Let x and [formula] denote pairs [formula] and [formula] respectively. If [formula] then [formula] Otherwise, [formula] and [formula] where C is a unitary matrix acting on [formula] which is called the coin of the quantum walk. It is easy to check that matrix U is unitary. Intuitively, let the particle be at vertex v in state [formula] Then, at the next moment the particle will be at vertex vs in the superposition state [formula] This is the coined quantum walk on G corresponding to labelling L and coin C.

A typical example of the coined quantum walk is the Hadamard quantum walk on the cycle [formula] In this case, the coin is the Hadamard transformation: Another popular choice of the coin is Grover's transformation: That is, the state s remains unchanged with amplitude [formula] and moves to [formula] with amplitude - 2 / d. We will call walks with this coin the Grover quantum walks.

A generalization of this concept is the non-unitary quantum walk [\cite=aharonov_ambainis_kempe_vazirani01]. A non-unitary quantum walk is specified by 4-tuple [formula] where G and S are as before a finite graph and a finite set, ρ is a density matrix (i.e., a positive unit-trace operator on [formula]), and T is a completely-positive trace preserving operator acting on density matrices. In the literature, T is called a superoperator [\cite=preskill99], or a quantum channel [\cite=preskill99], or a trace-preserving quantum operation [\cite=nielsen_chuang00]. We will use these terms as synonyms. Let x denote a pair [formula]. The probability to find a particle at vertex v in state s at time t is given by [formula] A non-unitary quantum walk is local if [formula] for [formula] implies that there is [formula] with [formula] such that [formula] (The concept of locality is more complicated in the non-unitary case and this definition is different from the definition in [\cite=aharonov_ambainis_kempe_vazirani01].)

An example of a non-unitary quantum walk is given by a weighted sum of unitary quantum walks. In this example, [formula] where Ui are unitary operators, pi > 0, and [formula] Intuitively, an operator Ui is used at each step of the walk with probability pi. If all Ui are local, then T is also local. Another example is [formula] where Pi are projections and [formula] This is a walk in which with probability p the particle is measured and with probability 1 - p it is evolved according to the unitary operator U.

First, let us consider the case of unitary quantum walks. The probability distribution [formula] in general does not converge to any particular limit. Indeed, all eigenvalues of the matrix U have unit absolute value. As a consequence, every eigenvector of U corresponds to a stationary probability distribution. If the initial wave function ψ is a non-trivial superposition of the eigenvectors with different eigenvalues, then ψt continues to oscillate indefinitely. In the classical case this phenomenon occurs only when the random walk corresponds to a periodic Markov chain, and this case is not typical.

The time averages of the probabilities [formula] do converge, and the limit exists although may depend on the initial function ψ. We will call this limit the time-averaged probability distribution of the particle. In order to quantify the convergence of the initial distribution to this limit, let us define the distance of the initial distribution from its time-average by the formula This is the total variation distance between the averaged probability distribution at time T  and its limit. By analogy with the classical case, the mixing time of a general quantum walk is defined as follows: That is, this is the minimal time which is needed to reduce the distance between the worst initial distribution and its time-averaged limit to a quantity less than ε.

Another definition of the mixing time restricts the choice of initial wave functions. Namely, where B is the set of basis states, that is, ψ∈B if [formula] is a delta-function concentrated at [formula]  This is the definition used in [\cite=aharonov_ambainis_kempe_vazirani01]. Clearly, [formula]. In the case of classical random walks, these two mixing times are always equal to each other. In the the case of quantum walks, they can be different.

We intend to estimate the mixing time in terms of the distance between eigenvalues of U. Let λk = eiβk, [formula] be the distinct eigenvalues of U. We define the distance between λk and λl as the smallest distance along the unit circle: The relaxation time of operator U is defined as Finally, let us define the overlap of two functions φ and ψ by the formula

Note that if φ and ψ are two wave functions, then 0  ≤  Q  ≤  1 by the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality.

Let U be the unitary transformation on [formula] associated with a discrete-time quantum walk (not necessarily coined). Let U have m distinct eigenvalues and the relaxation time trel. Then,

(The proofs of all theorems are in Appendix.)

It is interesting to compare this bound with the corresponding result for the classical random walk, where [formula] where πmin  is the smallest probability in the limit distribution (see for example Theorems 12.3 and 12.4 on p. 155 in [\cite=levin_peres_wilmer09]). In many cases the limit distribution is uniform and this bound can be written as [formula] where n is the number of vertices in the graph. Note, however, that trel have a different meaning in the classical case where it denotes the inverse of the difference between 1 (the largest eigenvalue) and the second largest eigenvalue (i.e., the inverse of the "spectral gap").

Another significant difference in the formulas for the mixing time is that ε enters as log ε and ε- 1 in the classical and quantum cases, respectively. This is due to the fact that the convergence is exponentially fast in the classical case and polynomial (even linear) in the quantum case.

Finally, it is worthwhile to note that in many cases the classical bound [formula] is not optimal, and a large literature is devoted to improvement of this result to tmix  ≤  ctrel with a sharp constant c.

For the lower bound we prove the following result.

Let U be the unitary transformation on [formula] associated with a discrete-time quantum walk (not necessarily coined). Suppose that U has only real eigenvectors. Let λ and [formula] be two distinct eigenvalues with the corresponding eigenvectors ψ and [formula] Assume that [formula] and [formula] Then,

In particular, if λ   and [formula] are two eigenvalues with the smallest distance between them along the circle, then [formula] and we obtain the estimate valid for all sufficiently small ε.

The main message of Theorems [\ref=theorem_disc_time_upper_bound] and [\ref=theorem_disc_time_lower_bound] is that the relation of the mixing and relaxation times in the quantum case is similar to the analogous relation in the classical case. However, the relaxation time is defined differently in the quantum case. It is not the inverse of the difference between the largest and the second largest eigenvalue, but the inverse of the minimal distance between all distinct eigenvalues.

Previously, the speed of convergence of (unitary) discrete-time quantum walks was investigated in [\cite=aharonov_ambainis_kempe_vazirani01]. The upper bound for the quantum walks that we obtain in Theorem [\ref=theorem_disc_time_upper_bound] is similar to the bound in Theorem 6.1 of [\cite=aharonov_ambainis_kempe_vazirani01]. The mixing time is [formula] where trel is the inverse of the minimal distance between the distinct eigenvalues of the matrix U. The main difference of our result from the result in [\cite=aharonov_ambainis_kempe_vazirani01] is that we have [formula] instead of log (n), where m and n are the numbers of distinct and all eigenvalues, respectively.

This difference is significant for the case of the discrete walk on the hypercube, where the number of eigenvalues is 2d and the number of distinct eigenvalues is d + 1. In particular, we show that the mixing time on the hypercube is O(n log n / ε) and not exponential as was suggested in [\cite=moore_russell02] based on previous estimates in [\cite=aharonov_ambainis_kempe_vazirani01].

The lower bound that we obtain is in terms of the relaxation time trel. It essentially says that the mixing time is [formula] This bound is different from the bound obtained in [\cite=aharonov_ambainis_kempe_vazirani01], which is formulated in terms of a geometrical property of the underlying graph. In addition, the mixing time is defined differently in [\cite=aharonov_ambainis_kempe_vazirani01]. As a result, the mixing time of the Hadamard walk on the cycle is of order [formula] in Theorem 4.2 of [\cite=aharonov_ambainis_kempe_vazirani01], and of order [formula] in our Example 1. In the classical case, the mixing time is of the order [formula]

Now let us consider non-unitary quantum walks. The study of these walks helps us to understand how the decoherence affects performance of quantum algorithms. It was noted (see [\cite=kendon_tregenna03]) that decoherence in quantum walks can be useful for quantum algorithms. In particular, it appears that a small amount of decoherence can speed up the mixing of the walk. Numeric evidence in [\cite=kendon_tregenna03] was later corroborated by analytical estimates in [\cite=richter07]. More information about decoherence in quantum walks and additional references can be found in the review article [\cite=kendon07].

Let M denote the linear space of Hermitian linear operators acting on [formula] The space M is a Hilbert space with respect to the norm [formula] (which we call L2-norm). Other useful norms on M are [formula] where [formula] and [formula] where μ is a density matrix. We call these norms the trace and [formula] norms, respectively. Superoperators are operators on M which possess some additional properties. Some well-known properties of superoperators are summarized in the proposition below.

Superoperator T is a contraction in the trace norm (i.e., [formula]). There exists a density matrix ρst such that Tρst  =  ρst.

This proposition is an immediate consequence of Theorem 9.2 and Exercise 9.9 in [\cite=nielsen_chuang00].

Note that in many cases T is not self-adjoint in L2 norm. Moreover, recall that in the classical case the stochastic matrix of a random walk is always self-adjoint with respect to the norm [formula] where μ is the stationary probability distribution. (This result can be traced to the fact that every random walk is a reversible Markov chain.) In contrast, the superoperator of a non-unitary quantum walk T is not necessarily self-adjoint with respect to the norm [formula]. In fact, it appears that T is not even a normal operator (i.e., [formula] in many situations of interest.

Proposition [\ref=proposition_properties_channels] establishes the existence of the stationary density matrix. However, it does not say anything about the uniqueness or convergence properties, and we cannot expect that these properties hold in general. For example, a unitary quantum walk typically has many stationary density matrices and the convergence fails unless we average density matrices over time. The following theorem establishes the uniqueness and convergence properties provided that the quantum walk satisfies a certain condition. Let us call a density matrix ρ strictly positive and write ρ > 0, if [formula] implies that x = 0. Next, let T be a linear operator acting on M. We will call T strongly positive if for every density matrix ρ there exists an integer n > 0 such that Tnρ > 0.

(This definition is similar to a corresponding definition in the theory of Markov chains, in which it is shown that a stochastic matrix of a Markov chain is strongly positive if and only if the Markov chain is ergodic, that is, aperiodic and irreducible.)

The multiplicity of an eigenvalue λ is defined as [formula] The rank of λ is [formula] The eigenvalue is called simple if its rank equals 1.

Let T be a strongly positive superoperator. Then, (i) T has a simple eigenvalue 1. (ii) The corresponding eigenvector ρst is a strictly positive density matrix. (iii) For every initial density matrix ρ0, Tnρ0  →  ρst, as n  →    ∞  .

Proof is in Appendix.

After the convergence to the stationary distribution is established, it is natural to ask for an estimate on the mixing time. First, let us define the mixing time for a non-unitary quantum walks. The definition is different from the definition for the unitary walks since no time-averaging is necessary. The measurement at time t finds the walking particle at the vertex v in state s with probability [formula], where x denote the pair [formula] and ρ is the initial density matrix. If T is strongly positive, then these probabilities converge to a limit [formula] which does not depend on the initial density matrix. Hence, we can define the total variation distance as [formula]. The corresponding mixing time can be defined as

Unfortunately, while it is easy to see that the asymptotic behavior of Tt is governed by the spectral radius of T, it is difficult to estimate the mixing time because of the non-normality of operator T. The essential difficulty is that for such operators it is hard to estimate the duration of the transient behavior. It is the same problem that makes it difficult to estimate the mixing time for non-reversible Markov chains.

(In one particular example of a non-unitary continuous-time walk on cycle this difficulty has been overcome and an estimate on the mixing time has been derived in [\cite=richter07].)

We consider several examples of unitary walks in this paper. The table summarizes results for unitary quantum walks on a complete graph, a cycle, and a hypercube.

It appears from this table that the mixing time for quantum walks is of similar order as that for the corresponding classical random walks. In particular, the unitary quantum walks do not allow a quadratic speedup over classical walks, in contrast to the results for the mixing time in [\cite=aharonov_ambainis_kempe_vazirani01]. The reason for this difference is that the mixing time defined in [\cite=aharonov_ambainis_kempe_vazirani01] restricts the initial distributions of the particle to the class of distributions concentrated on a particular vertex of a graph, while we allow for arbitrary initial distributions. Note that this result does not rule out that the quadratic speedup can be achieved by non-unitary quantum walks. Some evidence in favour of this conjecture can be found in [\cite=kendon_tregenna03] and [\cite=richter07].

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we apply bounds on mixing times to particular examples of quantum walks on the cycle, hypercube, and complete graph. The proofs of the theorems are relegated to Appendix.

Examples

Example 1. (Cycle) .

The mixing time for the Hadamard quantum walk on the n-cycle satisfies the following inequalities: where c1 and c2 are positive constants.

Proof: The eigenvalues of the Hadamard walk on the cycle with n vertices were found in [\cite=aharonov_ambainis_kempe_vazirani01]. They are where [formula] In order to describe the eigenvectors, let χk, 0  ≤  k  ≤  n - 1, be functions in [formula] defined by the formula [formula] Then all eigenvectors have the form [formula] where v is a 2-vector that depends on k.

Indeed, if S and [formula] are the left and right shift operator on [formula], respectively, then we can write U as a 2-by-2 block matrix, with blocks U11 and U12 equal [formula] and blocks U21 and U22 equal [formula] and [formula] respectively. It follows that [formula] where Let Then, eigenvectors of Ak can be written as [formula] with [formula]The corresponding eigenvectors of U are [formula] with eigenvalues [formula] for α = 1,2.

Note thatThe smallest difference between βk occurs when k = 0 and 1 and it can be estimated by c / n2 for a suitable constant c. It follows that the relaxation time is trel  ~  cn2, and by Theorem [\ref=theorem_disc_time_upper_bound] the mixing time is with a certain constant c2 > 0.

It is easy to estimate the overlap of eigenvectors that correspond to eigenvalues β0 and β1. It is greater than 0.97 for all n. By Theorem [\ref=theorem_disc_time_lower_bound], we have QED.

Example 2. (Hypercube)

The mixing time of the quantum walk on a hypercube was previously studied in [\cite=moore_russell02], and we use their setup in the definition of quantum walk. The quantum walk on the hypercube is also analyzed in [\cite=kempe05] with emphasis on the hitting time of the walk.

Consider a hypercube graph [formula] with 2n vertices. We think about vertices as indexed by numbers from 0 to 2n - 1 in the binary representation with n digits. The edges of the graph are put between numbers that are different in one bit only. The set of states S consists of n elements. We consider the Grover quantum walk. That is, a particle at vertex v in state s goes to the vertex w which is different from vertex v only in the bit s. It remains in state s with amplitude 2 / n - 1 and goes to state [formula] with amplitude 2 / n.

The mixing time for the Grover quantum walk on the n-dimensional hypercube satisfies the following inequalities:

Proof: The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Grover quantum walk on the n-dimensional hypercube were found by Moore and Russell in [\cite=moore_russell02]. The eigenvalues are where [formula] We describe eigenvectors below. For the convenience of the reader, we also give a short verification of the result .

For each sequence [formula] of 0 and 1, define [formula] by the formula [formula] All eigenvectors of the matrix U have the form [formula] where [formula] is an n-vector that depends on t, and j = 1,...,n.

Indeed, the unitary matrix U can be written as a n-by-n block matrix, in which the ij-th block is bSj if i  ≠  j and aSj if i = j. Here a = 2 / n - 1, b = 2 / n and [formula] is the shift operator which acts as follows: [formula] where addition is modulo 2. Note that [formula]

A computations shows that [formula] where A is an n-by-n matrix (which depends on t) with entries [formula] In other form, A = D + bP, where [formula] and [formula]

It is easy to verify that the following vectors are eigenvectors of A. Let k be the number of non-zero entries in vector t. First, assume that n > k  ≥  1 and define [formula] and vr = x1 - tr. Then [formula] is an eigenvector of A with eigenvalue

In addition, note that every non-zero vector v such that vr = 0 if tr = 0 and [formula], is an eigenvector of A with eigenvalue 1. The set of such vectors form an eigenspace of dimension k - 1. Similarly, every non-zero v such that vr = 0 if tr = 1 and [formula] is an eigenvector of A with eigenvalue - 1. The set of such vectors forms an eigenspace of dimension n - k - 1.

For the case when t = 0, the vector [formula] is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 1 and its orthogonal complement is eigenspace of - 1. For [formula] the situation is reverse.

By counting dimensions of eigenspaces, it is clear that these are all eigenvalues of matrix A. Since there are 2n different choices of vector t, we also found all eigenvalues of matrix U. It follows that these eigenvalues are ±  1, and λ±  k for [formula]

From the formula for eigenvalues, the distance between distinct eigenvalues can be estimated from below as [formula] Hence, [formula]

By applying Theorem [\ref=theorem_disc_time_upper_bound], we find

For the lower bound, consider for simplicity the case of even n = 2m. (The case of odd n is similar.) Let vx,k denote the value of function [formula] on vertex x and state k, and consider the eigenvectors that correspond to eigenvalues λ+m and λ+m + 1 respectively. Then, it is easy to compute the overlap of these eigenvectors as [formula] for large n. The distance between arguments of eigenvalues λ+m and λ-m + 1 is approximately 2 / n. Hence, by Theorem [\ref=theorem_disc_time_lower_bound] we have the inequalityQED.

Example 3. (Complete graph)

There are several ways to define a discrete-time walk on the complete graph with n vertices. We will consider the following variant. Let [formula] Define the entries of the unitary matrix as follows. In words, let the particle start at vertex v in state s. Then at the next moment of time it will be at vertex w = s. The particle moves to state [formula] with amplitude [formula] for [formula] If [formula] then the amplitude of the transition is [formula]

The mixing time for the quantum walk on the complete graph satisfies inequalities:where c is a positive constant.

Proof: We will show that the eigenvalues of U are 1, - 1, i and - i with multiplicities n(n - 1) / 2, 1 + (n - 1)(n - 2) / 2, n - 1, and n - 1,  respectively. Let [formula] Then, the action of U can be written as follows: where XT is the transposed matrix X, 1n is the column n-by-1 vector that consists of all ones, and 1Tn is the corresponding row vector.

If X = XT and all columns of X sum to 0, then U(X) = X. This gives us an eigenspace of operator U with eigenvalue 1 and dimension n(n - 1) / 2.

Similarly if XT =  - X and all columns of X sum to 0, then [formula] This gives us an eigenspace of U with eigenvalue - 1. In addition, [formula] Hence, the dimension of the eigenspace with eigenvalue - 1 is 1 + (n - 1)(n - 2) / 2. In order to find the eigenspaces with eigenvalues ±  i, consider U2. It acts as follows:Let [formula] and [formula] be arbitrary numbers satisfying the conditions [formula] and define Xij = ri + cj. Then [formula] Hence, these matrices belong to the eigenspace of U2 with eigenvalue - 1. The dimension of this space is 2n - 2. It follows that U has two eigenspaces of dimension n - 1 which correspond to eigenvalues i and - i, respectively. By counting dimensions we confirm that we have found all eigenvalues and eigenspaces of matrix U.

The relaxation time is [formula] By applying Theorems [\ref=theorem_disc_time_lower_bound] and [\ref=theorem_disc_time_upper_bound], the mixing time satisfies inequalities

for some positive c1 and c2.

Proofs of Theorems

Proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem_disc_time_upper_bound]: Let Vk be the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue βk of operator U. Then, we can write where φk∈Vk, [formula] [formula] Then at time t, and Hence,

[formula]

It follows that and

In order to bound this quantity, note that and, therefore, Note that [formula] where [formula] is the distance between βk and βl modulo 2π, that is, [formula] Let Δ denote [formula] and assume that [formula] Then we can write [formula] where [formula] This inequality holds because the shortest arc of the circle between βk and βl contains [formula] non-overlapping intervals whose endpoints are βs and the length of each of these intervals is at least Δ. It follows that [formula]

Next,

[formula]

This sum can be estimated as follows: We estimate and since [formula] we have

Hence, QED.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem_disc_time_lower_bound]: Let the initial function be [formula] and let [formula] Then we compute:

Consider interval Ir  =  Δ- 1π(1 / 6 + 2r,5 / 6 + 2r), where r is a non-negative integer. For every T∈Ir, [formula] Moreover, there is an integer Tr∈Ir because [formula] Note that the distance between Tr and Tr + 1 is less than 3Δ- 1π.

For every integer Tr we have (The second inequality holds because Δ  ≤  2, and therefore [formula])

It follows that if ε > 0 is sufficiently small then there exists an integer Tr between [formula] and [formula] such that d(Tr)  ≥  ε. In particular, if [formula] then [formula] and we concludeQED.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem_nonunitary_convergence]:  The proof of (i) and (ii) is an application of results by Krein and Rutman from [\cite=krein_rutman48]. In this paper a cone K in a Banach space X is fixed and operator [formula] is called strongly positive if for every non-zero x∈K, there is an integer n > 0, such that Anx is in the interior of K. Theorem 6.3 of this paper (on page 70 of the English translation) shows that if A is compact and strongly positive, then there exists one and only one eigenvector of A in the interior of K and the corresponding eigenvalue exceeds all others in absolute value. Moreover, the proof of the theorem shows that this eigenvalue is simple. The claim of our theorem follows if we apply the Krein-Rutman theorem to the cone of positive-definite matrices. Indeed, by [\ref=proposition_properties_channels] there exists ρst such that Tρst  =  ρst. Since T is strongly positive, hence ρst is in the interior of K (i.e., strictly positive); by the Krein-Rutman theorem it is the only eigenvector in the interior of K, and its eigenvalue 1 is simple.

For (iii), let Z be the space of Hermitian matrices with zero trace, [formula] Then, TZ  ⊂  Z and all the eigenvalues of T|Z are less than 1 in absolute value, because 1 is a simple eigenvalue and ρst∉Z. It follows that the spectral radius η of T|Z is smaller than 1. Hence, [formula] which implies that Tnz  →  0 for every z∈Z. Since ρ0  -  ρst belongs to Z for every density matrix ρ0, we conclude that Tnρ0  →  ρst for every ρ0. QED.
