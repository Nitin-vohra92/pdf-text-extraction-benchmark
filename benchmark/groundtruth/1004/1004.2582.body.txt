On Property (FA) for Wreath Products

Introduction

Property (FA) was introduced by Serre in his monograph [\cite=S]: a group G is said to have Property (FA) if every isometric action of G on a (simplicial) tree has a fixed point. Serre's fundamental result [\cite=S] about Property (FA) says that a group G has Property (FA) if and only if the three following conditions are satisfied

G is not a nontrivial amalgam;

G has no quotient isomorphic to [formula];

G is not the union of a properly increasing sequence of subgroups.

If G is denumerable, the last condition is equivalent to the requirement that G is finitely generated. In general, it is referred to in the literature as "G has cofinality ≠  ω" and is fulfilled by some uncountable groups [\cite=KT]. Traditional examples of finitely generated groups with Property (FA) include

finitely generated torsion groups;

Coxeter groups defined by a Coxeter matrix with no occurrence of ∞  ;

special linear groups over the integers, [formula], for n  ≥  3;

more generally, groups with Kazhdan's Property (T);

irreducible lattices in semisimple Lie groups of real rank at least two, e.g. [formula].

The first three of these examples were explained by Serre in [\cite=S]; ([\ref=ka]) was proved by Watatani in [\cite=W], using the characterisation of property (T) in terms of affine actions on Hilbert spaces; and finally ([\ref=rers]) was proved by Margulis (see [\cite=margulis]).

The aim of this article is to investigate Property (FA) for wreath products. We recall that given two groups A, B and a B-set X, their (permutational) wreath product is defined as the group

[formula]

where

[formula]

is the direct sum of isomorphic copies Ax of A indexed by X. In the special case when X = B with B acting by left multiplication on itself, one obtains the standard wreath product and this, we denote simply as [formula]. If A and B are finitely generated and X has finitely many B-orbits, then [formula] is finitely generated as well.

Consider the permutational wreath product [formula]. Assume that A  ≠  {1}, [formula] and X has finitely many B-orbits, each of which contains more than one element. The following are equivalent

G has Property (FA);

B has Property (FA) and A is a group with finite abelianisation, which cannot be expressed as the union of a properly increasing sequence of subgroups.

Contrast with the following result on property (T) groups [\cite=V]: the wreath product [formula] of two non-trivial groups A,B has property (T) if and only if A has property (T) and B is finite.

The following is a well-known problem (it appears for instance as [\cite=Cw] and in [\cite=yves]).

Is every finitely generated group with Property (FA) the quotient of a finitely presented group with property (FA)?

It can also be stated as "is Property (FA) open in the space of marked groups?" (see [\cite=CG]). The analogous question for some other fixed point properties has a positive answer

for Property (F[formula]) (fixed point property on [formula]-trees), a result of Culler and Morgan [\cite=CM].

Property (FH) (fixed point property on Hilbert spaces, also known as Kazhdan's Property (T)), a result independently due to Shalom and Gromov ([\cite=Y] and [\cite=grom])

more generally, again by Gromov [\cite=grom], the fixed point property on any class of metric spaces which is stable under "scaling ultralimits", e.g. the class of all [formula]-spaces.

It is an old open question [\cite=shalen] whether Property (FA) implies the a priori stronger Property (F[formula]). Of course a positive answer would imply a positive answer to Question [\ref=fp].

Some evidence for a positive answer for Question [\ref=fp] is given by the case of wreath products. From the proof of Theorem [\ref=t1], one can deduce the proposition below.

Let A and B be finitely presented groups and let X be a B-set with finitely many orbits. If in addition, A has finite abelianisation and B has Property (FA), then [formula] is the quotient of a finitely presented group with Property (FA).

Note that Baumslag [\cite=B] proved that a wreath product of non-trivial finitely presented groups [formula] is finitely presented only when B is finite.

A group G has hereditary Property (FA) if G and all its finite index subgroups have Property (FA).

It is natural to address Question [\ref=fp] with Property (FA) replaced by hereditary (FA). In this situation, the answer turns out to be negative and wreath products provide a large class of elementary examples.

Let [formula] be the standard wreath product of two finitely generated groups. Assume that B is an infinite, residually finite group and that A has at least one non-trivial finite quotient. Then every finitely presented group mapping onto G has a finite index subgroup with a surjective homomorphism onto a non-abelian free group.

The next theorem, which relies on Theorem [\ref=t1] and further arguments, shows how to chose the group G from Theorem [\ref=lastt] to have hereditary (FA).

Let [formula] be a wreath product of finitely generated groups, with B infinite. The following are equivalent

G has hereditary Property (FA);

B has hereditary Property (FA) and A has finite abelianisation.

If [formula] with F any non-trivial finite group, then G has hereditary Property (FA) by Theorem [\ref=hfa], but is not the quotient of any finitely presented group with the same property, by Theorem [\ref=lastt].

Despite the analogy between Theorems [\ref=t1] and [\ref=hfa], Theorem [\ref=lastt] shows that Proposition [\ref=fpfa] is false when (FA) is replaced by hereditary (FA).

Theorems [\ref=lastt] and [\ref=hfa] provide many instances (illustrated by Example [\ref=exa]) of groups with hereditary Property (FA), which are not quotients of finitely presented groups with hereditary Property (FA). Here is another one, of a different kind. Let Γ be the first Grigorchuk group [\cite=slava]. This is a finitely generated group every proper quotient of which is finite; in particular it cannot be expressed as a non-trivial wreath product with an infinite quotient. Also, it is a finitely generated torsion group and therefore has hereditary Property (FA). It follows however from [\cite=grig] (see also [\cite=bast]) that every finitely presented group mapping onto Γ has a finite index subgroup mapping onto the free group.

Theorem [\ref=t1] holds when Property (FA) replaced by (F[formula]), with a similar proof.

It is not hard to extend Theorem [\ref=hfa] to permutational wreath products. On the other hand, the extension of Theorem [\ref=lastt] to permutational wreath products is more delicate.

Property (FA)

In this part, we prove Theorem [\ref=t1] and Proposition [\ref=fpfa]. If a group G acts on a set X, we denote by XG the set of G-fixed points in X. We think of each tree as the set of its own vertices. We have the two following standard lemmas.

Suppose that a group H acts on a tree T without inversions. Let A and B be subgroups of H such that TA and TB are non-empty. If = 1 then [formula].

On the contrary, suppose that [formula] is empty. Then, there is a unique geodesic segment α in T, of minimal length, joining TA and TB. However, as A and B commute, A preserves the set TB. This implies that A pointwise fixes the geodesic segment α, hence fixes at least one element of TB, which contradicts the assumption that [formula] is empty.

We say that an action of a group G on a tree T is parabolic if every element of G has a fixed point, but there is no global fixed point.

If G has a parabolic action on a tree, then G is the union of a properly increasing sequence of subgroups.

By a classical theorem of Tits [\cite=tits], there exists an end of T which is strongly fixed by G. In other words, there exists a geodesic ray (vn) such that for every g∈G, g.vn = vn for n large enough. Define the non-decreasing sequence of stabilizers

[formula]

By assumption, [formula]. But G  ≠  Gn because G has no global fixed point.

The main idea of the proof of Theorem [\ref=t1] is given by the following result.

Let A and B be groups. Let X be a B-set with [formula], and write W = A(X). Suppose that the permutational wreath product [formula] acts without inversions on a tree T. Assume that [formula], [formula], and that for any x, the action of Ax on T is not parabolic. Then there exists a unique geodesic line L  ⊂  T preserved by W. Moreover, the W-action on L is non-trivial and by translations.

Let us first prove the proposition with the extra-assumption that G acts transitively on X, and we fix a basepoint o in X.

First, we prove that [formula]. Assume the contrary. For each b∈B, we have b.TAo = TAb.o; in particular, by transitivity, the subtree TAx is nonempty for each x∈X. Moreover, for x  ≠  o, Ao and Ax commute. Therefore, by Lemma [\ref=lem], we obtain [formula].

By transitivity of the G-action on X, we see that G is generated by Ax and B for any x∈X. Accordingly, if for some x, [formula], then we deduce that [formula] and in particular [formula], a contradiction.

Therefore, [formula] for any x∈X. Denote by ux the unique vertex in TAx closest to TB. Note that we have ub.x = b.ux for all b∈B. For any vertex v in T, denote by [formula] the geodesic segment joining TB to v (so [formula]). Since T is a tree, if for some x∈X, v belongs to the subtree TAx and kx = d(TB,TAx), we have ux = vkx. Now

[formula]

Picking v in [formula], we deduce that ub.o = vkb.o = vko = uo; thus ub.o = uo for all b. So uo is invariant under B, hence [formula], a contradiction.

Now we know that [formula]. If every element of Ao fixes some element of T, the action of Ao on T is, by definition, parabolic; this is ruled out by hypothesis. Accordingly, Ao contains an element a acting hyperbolically on T. Pick b∈B with b.o  ≠  o; then a' = bab- 1 also acts hyperbolically on T. Let L,L' denote the axes of a and a'. For any x∈X - {o} (resp. ∈X - {b.o}), Ax centralises a (resp. a'), so Ax preserves L (resp. L'). In particular, a' preserves L, but since L' is the unique axis preserved by a', we deduce that L  =  L'. Therefore, for any x∈X, Ax preserves L. Now we claim that Ao preserves the orientation of L; otherwise, it contains some element a'' having a unique fixed point on L. Since a' centralizes a'', we deduce that this point is also fixed by a', a contradiction since a' acts by non-trivial translation on L. By conjugating, we deduce that for each x, Ax preserves the orientation of L, so the whole action of W on L is by translations and non-trivial.

Finally we have to tackle the non-transitive case. Denote by Xi the (finitely many) B-orbits of X. Consider an action of G as in the statement of the proposition. Then, for some i, [formula]. By the transitive case, A(Xi) preserves a unique line L  ⊂  T, on which it acts non-trivially and by translations. Set Y = X - Xi. Then A(Y) centralizes A(Xi), so preserves L. Moreover, A(Y) also preserves the orientation of L (otherwise as in the transitive case, it contains a point with a unique fixed point, which is then fixed by a hyperbolic element in A(Xi), a contradiction).

Under the conditions of the theorem, suppose that the permutational wreath product [formula] has Property (FA). Then clearly B, being a quotient of G, has Property (FA). Moreover, A cannot be written as a properly increasing union of a sequence of subgroups (An), since otherwise (using [formula]) G would be the increasing union of its subgroups [formula] and would fail to have Property (FA). Moreover, since X has no one-element orbit, the abelianisation of G is given by [formula], where Y denotes the orbit set [formula]. Hence the abelianisation of A is also finite.

Conversely, suppose that B has property (FA) and the group A, which has finite abelianisation, cannot be written as a properly increasing union of its subgroups. Let G act without inversions on a tree T. To verify that G has property (FA) we need to prove that TG is non-empty.

Write W = A(X). Suppose that [formula]. Then this is a nonempty subtree the action on which factors through B. So by Property (FA) for B, we obtain [formula].

Otherwise, [formula]; [formula] by Property (FA) for G, and the action of Ax is not parabolic by Lemma [\ref=cof]. So Proposition [\ref=propess] implies that there is a non-trivial homomorphism from A(X) to [formula]. This is impossible since [formula].

Let [formula] (m  ≥  2) be subtrees of a tree T. If the Ti have pairwise nonempty intersection, then their intersection is non-empty.

We restrict ourselves to the case when X is B-transitive; the reader can easily deduce the general case.

Fix a basepoint o in X and let C  ⊂  B be its stabilizer. Fix finite generating subsets SA,SB of A and B. Consider the group K obtained from the free product [formula] by adding the relators

[formula]

(b∈SB - C, a,a'∈SA).

In K, for b∈B write Ab = bAb- 1. Let K act on a tree T. By Lemma [\ref=tree], it is enough to check that any pair of generators of K has a common fixed point. Since B has Property (FA), every pair in SB has a common fixed point. The proof now proceeds along the same lines as that of Proposition [\ref=propess].

Suppose [formula]. Thus, every pair of generators in SA has a common fixed point. It remains to show that any pair (a,s)∈SA  ×  SB has a common fixed point. Let us first check that [formula].

If s∈C, then, thanks to relators of type (1), we have =  {1}, hence As = A1, so this is clear;

If s∉C, then the relators of type (2) assure us that =  {1}. Hence by Lemma [\ref=lem], A1 and As have a common fixed point.

As in the proof of Theorem [\ref=t1], we denote the point in TAb closest to TB as ub. Now, u1 = s.u1 = us for all s∈SB, so this is a fixed point for B. Thus, a and s have a common fixed point.

Suppose [formula]. Observe that SB - C is non-empty else X would have contained only one element. Pick b∈SB - C. The subgroups A1 and Ab contain elements a, a' respectively whose actions on T are hyperbolic. The axis L of a' is stabilised by A1. Moreover every element of A1 preserves the orientation of L for otherwise, its unique fixed point is a fixed point for a'. Thus the action of A1 on L is by translations. Since [formula], we deduce that A1 acts trivially, contradicting the existence of a.

Hereditary Property (FA)

We need the following classical lemma.

Let G0 be a group and let (Nk)k be a non-decreasing sequence of normal subgroups of G0. Set G = G0 / N, where [formula] and Gk  =  G0 / Nk. Let H be a finitely presented group. Then every homomorphism f:H  →  G lifts to a homomorphism fk:H  →  Gk for some k. If in addition, f is surjective and G0 is finitely generated, then fk can be chosen to be surjective.

It is a standard result that a group H is finitely presented (if and) only if the functor [formula] commutes with inductive limits (see [\cite=AR], Example 1.2(5) and Corollary 3.13, which reach far beyond the realm of groups). Since [formula], this proves the existence of an fk.

Suppose now that f is surjective and G0 has a finite generating subset S. For every s∈S, the image of s into G belongs to the image of f; thus there exists gs in the kernel of Gk  →  G such that sgs belongs to fk(H). Since S is finite, there exists [formula] such that gs = 1 in [formula] for all s∈S. Thus the composite map [formula] lifts f and is surjective.

If F is a finite subset of B - {1}, define Γ(A,B,F) as the quotient of [formula] by the "relators"

[formula]

G=Γ(A,B,{u:i≤ k}).

[formula]

Consider the short exact sequence of groups:

[formula]

Assume that A does not contain any nonabelian free subgroup, and that G is finitely generated (or more generally, is not the union of a properly increasing sequence of subgroups) and does not map onto the integers or the infinite dihedral group. Then, G has Property (FA) if and only if B has Property (FA).

If G is a group, define [formula] to be the largest normal subgroup of G without nonabelian free subgroups. The subgroup [formula] is always well-defined. Indeed, let N1 and N2 be normal subgroups of G with no nonabelian free subgroups. Then N1N2 is also normal and the second isomorphism theorem implies that N1N2 cannot contain a non-abelian free subgroup.

The "only if" part of the proposition is clear. Conversely, suppose that G fails to have Property (FA). Then G splits as a non-trivial amalgam [formula]. If the amalgam were degenerate (K has index two in both H and L), then G would map onto the infinite dihedral group. Therefore, we can apply [\cite=Cicc], which says in particular that [formula] is contained in K. Since A is by definition contained in [formula], this shows that [formula] splits as a non-trivial amalgam [formula], and therefore fails to have Property (FA).

The fact that the first condition implies the second one is as straightforward as the analogous implication for Theorem [\ref=t1], so we do not repeat the argument.

So assume that A has finite abelianisation and B has hereditary Property (FA).

We first prove the implication when A has trivial abelianisation, as the proof is then easier. In this case, by Gruenberg [\cite=Gruenberg] every finite index subgroup of G contains the normal subgroup A(B) and is therefore of the form [formula] where C has finite index in B; since B is supposed to be infinite, C is non-trivial. This group [formula] is a permutational wreath product (with a non-transitive free action), so Theorem [\ref=t1] applies.

Before passing to the general case, we need to consider the special case when A is abelian (and thus finite). Every finite index subgroup H of G then is an extension of groups such that the kernel K is torsion (and abelian) and the quotient is a finite index subgroup of B. We claim that H has no quotient Q isomorphic to the group of integers or the infinite dihedral group. Suppose on the contrary that [formula] or D∞. Since Q has no non-trivial torsion normal subgroup, the image of K into Q is trivial, so Q is a quotient of B. But this is absurd since B has Property (FA) by hypothesis. So we can apply Proposition [\ref=p2] to deduce that H has Property (FA).

Suppose now, in general, that the derived subgroup D of A has finite index in A, and that H has finite index in G; let H act on a tree T. Then Gruenberg [\cite=Gruenberg] implies that H contains D(B). We claim that [formula]. Suppose D(B) has no global fixed point. Set [formula]. The group [formula] is a permutational wreath product; B being a free C-set. Since B is infinite, C is non-trivial, so Proposition [\ref=propess] applies. Therefore, D(B) preserves a unique line, on which it acts by non-trivial translations. Since D(B) is normal, this line is preserved by G'. The action on this line is given by a homomorphism from G' to the infinite dihedral group. Since D∞ is residually finite, Gruenberg's theorem imples that the homomorphism is trivial on D(B). This is impossible and so [formula].

Finally, since D(B) is normal in H, we know that T' is H-invariant and that the action of H on T' factors through H / D(B), which is a subgroup of finite index of [formula]. By the special case when the base group is abelian, we deduce that there is a fixed point. This proves that H has Property (FA).
