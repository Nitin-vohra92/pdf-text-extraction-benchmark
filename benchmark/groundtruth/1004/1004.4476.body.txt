Asymptotics of Young tableaux in the strip, the d-sums

Abstract. The asymptotics of the "strip" sums [formula] and of their d-sums generalizations T(α)d,ds(dm) (see Definition [\ref=definition1]) were calculated in [\cite=regev]. It was recently noticed that when d > 1 there is a certain confusion about the relevant notations in [\cite=regev], and the constant in the asymptotics of these d-sums T(α)d,ds(dm) seems to be off by a certain factor. Based on the techniques of [\cite=regev] we again calculate the asymptotics of the d-sums T(α)d,ds(dm). We do it here carefully and with complete details. This leads to Theorem [\ref=d.sum222] below, which replaces Corollary 4.4 of [\cite=regev] in the cases d > 1.

Introduction

Let λ be a partition and [formula] the number of non-zero parts of λ. Let [formula] denote the number of standard tableaux of shape λ. For the Young-Frobenius formula for [formula] see for example [\cite=jameskerber], and for the "hook" formula see for example [\cite=stanley].

The asymptotics of the sums [formula] and of the d-sums T(α)d,ds(dm) (see Definition [\ref=definition1]) were studied in [\cite=regev], see [\cite=regev] (there we used the notation [formula] instead of [formula]). We recently noticed that when d > 1 there is a certain confusion about the notations in [\cite=regev], and the constant in the asymptotics of the d-sums T(α)d,ds(dm) seems to be off by a certain factor.

Based on the techniques of [\cite=regev] we calculate, with complete details, the asymptotics of the d-sums T(α)d,ds(dm). While ths asymptotic formula for the sums [formula] remain unchanged as in [\cite=regev], this leads to a new asymptotic formula for the d-sums T(α)d,ds(dm), given in Theorem [\ref=d.sum222] below.

The validity of Theorem [\ref=d.sum222] can be tested as follows. In few cases the d-sums T(α)d,ds(dm) are given by a closed formula, which yield the corresponding asymptotics directly- independent of Theorem [\ref=d.sum222]. In all these cases, the direct asymptotics and the asymptotics deduced from Theorem [\ref=d.sum222] - agree, see Section [\ref=3.1]. Also, for small values of d and s it is possible to write an explicit formula for, say, T(1)d,ds(dm). By Theorem [\ref=d.sum222] T(1)d,ds(dm)≃A(d,s,dm). Now form the ratio T(1)d,ds(dm) / A(d,s,dm). Using, say, "Mathematica", calculate that ratio for increasing values of m, verifying that these values become closer and closer to 1 as m increases. This again tests and indicates the validity of Theorem [\ref=d.sum222].

The main theorem

The following definition recalls the d-sums from [\cite=regev].

Let m,s,d  ≥  1, then define

[formula]

Note that λ∈Bd(dm) if and only if λ can be written as [formula] with [formula], and then d divides [formula].

[formula]

[formula]

When d = 1 we denote T(α)1,s(m) = S(α)s(m). Thus

[formula]

We correct [\cite=regev] in the case d > 1 by proving the following theorem (see Theorem [\ref=d.sum2] below). Here the variable N is replaced by s.

Let [formula] and let [formula]. As m  →    ∞  ,

Asymptotics for a single [formula]

The following proposition corrects (and replaces) [\cite=regev], and is the key for proving Theorem [\ref=d.sum222]. Recall the notation

[formula]

Let [formula]. For 1  ≤  i  ≤  s write [formula] and assume the bi are bounded, so λi≃m / s. Then, as m goes to infinity,

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Apply, for example, the Young-Frobenius formula for [formula]: First, all λi≃m / s, hence we can write

[formula]

where [formula] is the product of factors of the form λi  -  λj + k, with various 0  ≤  k  ≤  ds, and which we now analyze.

For 1  ≤  i < j  ≤  s there are d2 factors of [formula] of the form λi  -  λj + k, with various k's, all of them satisfying [formula]. The number of pairs (i,j) where 1  ≤  i < j  ≤  s is s(s - 1) / 2, and each such pair contributes d2 times the factor [formula] , hence the factor [formula] in [\eqref=sch4] below.

In the cases i = j each of the s blocks (λdi) contributes [formula], hence the factor [formula] in [\eqref=sch4] below. It follows that

[formula]

Again since λi≃m / s,

[formula]

By [\cite=regev]

[formula]

hence by [\eqref=sch44] and [\eqref=sch45]

[formula]

[formula]

Now

[formula]

and by Stirling's formula

[formula]

It follows from [\eqref=sch5], [\eqref=sch6] and [\eqref=sch7] that

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Together with [\eqref=sch4] this yields

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

This completes the proof of Proposition [\ref=sch9].

Some examples

Using "Mathematica", Proposition [\ref=sch9] was tested and confirmed in the case d = 3, ~ s = 2, ~ b1 = 1 and b2 =  - 1, and with n = 3m getting larger and larger.

The case s = 1, any d, so [formula]. In this case

[formula]

By applying Stirling's formula directly we get that as m  →    ∞  ,

[formula]

This agrees with Proposition [\ref=sch9] since the factor [formula] in that proposition equals 1 in this case.

Here we repeat the proof of Proposition [\ref=sch9] - in the case d = s = 2, showing more explicitly the various steps of the calculations. Let [formula], so [formula]. Let [formula]. In that case we verify directly that

[formula]

By either the hook formula or by the Young-Frobenius formula

[formula]

Also λi + j≃m / 2 while [formula], hence

[formula]

By [\cite=regev]

[formula]

Since λ1 + 1≃m / 2,

[formula]

Also

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

[formula]

namely

[formula]

Finally

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

which verifies [\eqref=sch3].

Asymptotics for the general sums

As in [\cite=regev], Proposition [\ref=sch9] implies

[\cite=regev] Let [formula] denote the following domain:

[formula]

Also recall Definition [\ref=definition1]. Then, as m  →    ∞  ,

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

where

[formula]

Note that by [\cite=regev] and by the Selberg integral [\cite=forrester], [\cite=garsia], [\cite=selberg]

[formula]

[formula]

Thus Theorem [\ref=d.sum1] can be rewritten as follows.

Let [formula] and [formula]. Then, as m  →    ∞  ,

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Some special cases

The case s = 1

Let s = 1. In that case Bd,d(dm) = {λ} where [formula]. Thus, for Theorem [\ref=d.sum1] to hold, the product of the factors after the factor [formula] should equal 1, which is easy to verify.

The sums S(α)s(m)

In the case d = 1, in the notations of [\cite=regev], T(α)1,s(m) = S(α)s(m), and Theorem [\ref=d.sum2] becomes

[\cite=regev]. Let d = 1, [formula], [formula]. Then, as m  →    ∞  ,

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

This agrees with the asymptotic value of S(α)s(m) as given by [\cite=regev] in the case d = 1.

The case d = 1 and α = 1

Let d = α = 1, then as m  →    ∞  ,

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

which agrees with [\cite=regev].

The case d = 1, ~ α = 2

Consider the case d = 1 and α = 2 (any s), then

[formula]

For example, when s = 2 we have

[formula]

In this case we know [\cite=knuth] that T(2)1,2(n) = (2n)! / (n!  ·  (n + 1)!) = Cn, the n-th Catalan number, and by applying Stirling's formula directly, we obtain the same asymptotic value.

The case s = d = 2 and α = 1

The case s = d = 2 and α = 1. By Theorem [\ref=d.sum2]

[formula]

[formula]

Note that sequence A005700 of [\cite=sloane] gives the following remarkable identity:

[formula]

Applying Stirling's formula to the right-hand-side of [\eqref=sof1] we obtain the same asymptotic value:

[formula]

thus verifying Theorem [\ref=d.sum2] in this case.
