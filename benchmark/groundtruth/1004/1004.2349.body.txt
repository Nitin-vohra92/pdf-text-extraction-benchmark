Bases of the quantum cluster algebra of the Kronecker quiver

Introduction

Cluster algebras were introduced by S. Fomin and A. Zelevinsky [\cite=ca1][\cite=ca2] in order to study total positivity in algebraic groups and the specialization of canonical bases of quantum groups at q = 1. The study of [formula]-bases of cluster algebras is important. There are many results involving the construction of [formula]-bases of cluster algebras (for example, see [\cite=sherzel] and [\cite=calzel] for cluster algebras of rank 2, [\cite=CK2005] for finite type, [\cite=Dup] for type [formula], [\cite=gc] for [formula], [\cite=DXX] for affine type and [\cite=gls] for Q without oriented cycles). As a quantum analog of cluster algebras, quantum cluster algebras were defined by A. Berenstein and A. Zelevinsky in [\cite=berzel] in order to study canonical bases. A quantum cluster algebra is generated by a set of generators called cluster variables inside an ambient skew-field F. Under the specialization q = 1, the quantum cluster algebras are exactly cluster algebras.

Naturally, one may hope to construct [formula]bases for quantum cluster algebras and further quantum analogues of bases of the corresponding cluster algebras. In this short note, we deal with the case of the quantum cluster algebra of the Kronecker quiver and construct various bar-invariant [formula]bases by applying the q-deformation of the Caldero-Chapoton formula defined in [\cite=rupel] and the method in [\cite=sherzel]. Under the specialization q = 1, these [formula]bases are exactly the canonical basis, semicanonical basis and dual semicanonical basis of the corresponding cluster algebra in the sense of [\cite=sherzel],[\cite=calzel] and [\cite=gls] respectively. As a byproduct, we prove the positivity of the elements in these bases.

Recently, in [\cite=lampe], the author attached to certain element w in Weyl group a subalgebra U+q(w) of the positive part Uq(n) of the universal enveloping algebra of a Kac-Moody Lie algebra of type [formula]. The author proved that U+q(w) is a quantum cluster algebra in the sense of Berenstein-Zelevinsky and gave explicit formulae for the cluster variables. Note that the cluster variables are some elements of q-deformation of dual canonical basis elements of U+q(w). However it is not clear whether cluster monomials belong to the dual canonical basis. Thus comparing these [formula]bases constructed in this note with the dual canonical basis of U+q(w) becomes an interesting thing.

Preliminaries

Quantum cluster algebras

We begin with some of the terminology related to quantum cluster algebras. One can refer to [\cite=berzel] for more details. Let L be a lattice of rank m and [formula] a skew-symmetric bilinear form. We will need a formal variable q and consider the ring of integer Laurent polynomials [formula]. Define the based quantum torus associated to the pair (L,Λ) to be the [formula]-algebra T with a distinguished [formula]-basis {Xe:e∈L} and the multiplication given by

[formula]

It is easy to see that T is associative and the basis elements satisfy the following relations:

[formula]

It is known that T is an Ore domain, i.e., is contained in its skew-field of fractions F. The quantum cluster algebra will be defined as a [formula]-subalgebra of F.

A toric frame in F is a map [formula] of the form

[formula]

where φ is an automorphism of F and [formula] is an isomorphism of lattices. By the definition, the elements [formula] form a [formula]-basis of the based quantum torus TM: = φ(T) and satisfy the following relations:

[formula]

[formula]

where ΛM is the skew-symmetric bilinear form on [formula] obtained from the lattice isomorphism η. Let ΛM also denote the skew-symmetric m  ×  m matrix defined by λij  =  ΛM(ei,ej) where [formula] is the standard basis of [formula]. Given a toric frame M, let Xi = M(ei). Then we have

[formula]

An easy computation shows that:

[formula]

Let Λ be an m  ×  m skew-symmetric matrix and let [formula] be an m  ×  n matrix, n  ≤  m. We call the pair (Λ,) compatible if TΛ = (D|0) is an n  ×  m matrix with [formula] where [formula] for 1  ≤  i  ≤  n. The pair (M,) is called a quantum seed if the pair (ΛM,) is compatible. Define the m  ×  m matrix E = (eij) by

[formula]

For [formula], [formula], denote [formula]. Let [formula] with ck  ≥  0. Define the toric frame [formula] as follows:

[formula]

where the vector [formula] is the k - th column of [formula]. Then the quantum seed (M',') is defined to be the mutation of (M,) in direction k. We say that two quantum seeds are mutation-equivalent if they can ba obtained from each other by a sequence of mutations. Let C  =  {M'(ei):i∈[1,n]} where (M',') is mutation-equivalent to (M,). The elements of C are called cluster variables. Let P  =  {M(ei):i∈[n  +  1,m]} and the elements of P are called coefficients. The quantum cluster algebra Aq(ΛM,) is the [formula]-subalgebra of F generated by [formula]. We associated with (M,) the [formula]-linear bar-involution on TM by setting:

[formula]

It is easy to show that [formula] for all X,Y∈Aq(ΛM,) and that each element of [formula] is bar-invariant.

The Kronecker quiver

Given a compatible pair [formula], we can associate a valued quiver (see [\cite=rupel] for more details). Now we set [formula] and [formula]. The quiver Q associated to this pair is the Kronecker quiver:

Let k be a finite field with cardinality |k| = q2. The category rep(kQ) of finite-dimensional representations can be identified with the category of mod-kQ of finite-dimensional modules over the path algebra kQ. It is well-known (see [\cite=dlab]) that indecomposable kQ-module contains (up to isomorphism) three families: the indecomposable regular modules with dimension vector (ndp,ndp) for [formula] of degree dp (in particular, denoted by Rp(n) for dp = 1), the preprojective modules with dimension vector (n - 1,n) (denoted by M(n)) and the preinjective modules with dimension vector (n,n - 1) (denoted by N(n)). Here [formula].

For [formula], set

[formula]

Now, let [formula] and F be the skew field of fractions of T and thus the quantum cluster algebra of the Kronecker quiver Aq(Λ,) (denoted by Aq(2,2) in the following) is the [formula]-subalgebra of F generated by the cluster variables Xk, [formula], defined recursively by

[formula]

The quantum Laurent phenomenon ([\cite=berzel]) implies that each Xk belongs to the subring of T generated by q±  1 / 2, [formula]. The explicit Laurent expansion of each Xk in X1,X2 is given in [\cite=lampe] and [\cite=rupel].

Let V be a representation of the Kronecker quiver with dimension vector [formula]. For [formula], denote by [formula] the set of all subrepresentations M of V with [formula]. In [\cite=rupel], the author define the element XV of the quantum torus T by

[formula]

where [formula]. This formula is called a q-deformation of the Caldero-Chapoton formula ([\cite=caldchap]). Here and the following, we simply write [formula] instead of X() for [formula]

[\cite=rupel] For any [formula], the m-th cluster variable Xm of Aq(2,2) equals XV(m).

Bases of the quantum cluster algebra Aq(2,2)

In this section, we will construct various bar-invariant [formula]bases of quantum cluster algebra Aq(2,2). Under the specialization q = 1, these bases are just bases of the cluster algebra of the Kronecker quiver.

For any (r1,r2) and [formula], we write [formula] if ri  ≤  si for 1  ≤  i  ≤  2. Moreover, if there exists some i such that ri  <  si, then we write [formula]

By the definition of the q-deformation of the Caldero-Chapoton formula and the partial order in Definition [\ref=def], we obtain that the expansion of XV(m) have a minimal non-zero term [formula] where [formula]. In fact, [formula] by the explicit expansion of XV(m) in [\cite=lampe] and [\cite=rupel].

Let Rp(1) be the indecomposable regular module of degree 1 as above. Then

[formula]

Note that Rp(1) contains the three submodules: 0,M(1) and Rp(1). Thus the lemma immediately follows from the q-deformation of the Caldero-Chapoton formula.

By Lemma [\ref=1], the expression of XRp(1) is independent of the choice of [formula] of degree 1. Hence, we set

[formula]

(1) The n-th Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind is the polynomial [formula] defined by

[formula]

(2) The n-th Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind is the polynomial [formula] defined by

[formula]

It is obvious that Fn(x) = Sn(x) - Sn - 2(x). We denote z = Xδ,zn = Fn(z),sn = Sn(z) for n  ≥  0 and zn = sn = 0 for n < 0. Set

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

(1) It is easy to check that X(r,r)X(s,s) = X(r + s,r + s) for any [formula], thus the expansions of zn,sn and zn have a minimal non-zero term [formula] according to the partial order in Definition [\ref=def].

(2) The elements [formula] associated to these minimal non-zero terms [formula] in the expansion of the elements in the set B are different from each other. Indeed, it is easy to compute

[formula]

We note that there is at most one exceptional module in each dimension vector.

Now we define a ring homomorphism of the quantum cluster algebra Aq(2,2):

[formula]

which sends Xm to Xm + 1 and [formula] to [formula]. It is obviously an automorphism which preserves the defining relations. The following lemma is easy but important.

[formula]

By Theorem [\ref=rank2] and the definition of the q-deformation of the Caldero-Chapoton formula, we have

[formula]

Following these identities and Lemma [\ref=1], one easily confirm the relations

[formula]

Thus [formula]

For any [formula]

[formula]

By an easy computation, we have:

[formula]

Then by Lemma [\ref=1], it is easy to prove

[formula]

Thus we can finish the proof by Lemma [\ref=2] and applying the automorphism σ1.

[formula]

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=4], we can verify that [formula] and σ1(zn) = zn,σ1(sn) = sn.

The following proposition, which can be viewed as the quantum analogue of [\cite=sherzel], plays an essential role to construct [formula]bases of the quantum cluster algebra Aq(2,2).

(1) For m > n  ≥  1:

[formula]

(2) m  ≥  1 and [formula]:

[formula]

(3) For [formula]

[formula]

The proof of (1) follows from the inductive relations in the definition of Chebyshev polynomials. As for (2), we make induction on m. If m = 1, the equation in (2) is a direct corollary of Lemma [\ref=3]. We assume that (2) holds for m  ≤  k. For m = k + 1, we have

[formula]

This proves (2). Now we prove (3). If m = 0, it is obvious. If m = 1, by the recurrence relations ([\ref=recurrence]), we have

[formula]

We have proved that the equation [formula] (see ([\ref=imaginary])) holds, thus by Lemma [\ref=2], we have

[formula]

Now we assume that equations in (3) hold for m  ≤  k. For m = k + 1, by Lemma [\ref=3], we have

[formula]

Following the inductive assumption, it is equal to

[formula]

Using Lemma [\ref=3] again and (1) of this proposition, it is

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Similarly, by Lemma [\ref=3], we have

[formula]

Using the equation (*) and similar proof, we obtain

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=4] and properties of bar-invariant, we can easily obtain the similar results for zmXn,Xn + 2mXn,Xn + 2mXn.

We similarly define the quantized version of the definition of positivity in [\cite=sherzel].

A nonzero element x∈Aq(2,2) is positive if for every [formula] all the coefficients in the expansion of x as a Laurent polynomial in {xm,xm + 1} belong to [formula]

Every element in B,S and D is a positive element of quantum cluster algebra Aq(2,2).

By Lemma [\ref=1] and the fact zn(x) = sn(x) - sn - 2(x), we only need to prove every element in B is positive. By the definition of σ1 and Remark [\ref=9], it is enough to prove the positivity in {x1,x2}. We prove it by induction. For convenience, we write down the following equations according to Proposition [\ref=5] and Remark [\ref=8]: For m  ≥  1:

[formula]

For m  ≥  0:

[formula]

[formula]

It is easy to check that

[formula]

are positive elements in {x1,x2}. Now assume that

[formula]

are positive elements in {x1,x2}. Then by (3.2), (3.3) and (3.4), we know that X2m + 1,X2m + 2 and X- 1 - 2m are positive. Thus we obtain that z2m + 1 is positive by (3.1). Therefore by (3.5), we have that X- 2m - 2 is positive. Again by (3.2), we know that X2m + 3 is positive. Thus we get z2m + 2 is positive by (3.1) again. Throughout the above discussions we obtain

[formula]

are positive elements in {x1,x2}. The proof is finished.

In fact, by [\cite=Szanto][\cite=lampe][\cite=rupel], the positivity in the cluster variables is obvious, then applying the equation [formula], we can deduce the positivity in the elements zm for any [formula]. Here, we give an alternative proof without needing the explicit expansions of cluster variables.

The sets B,S and D are [formula]bases of the quantum cluster algebra Aq(2,2).

Note that if B is a [formula]basis of the quantum cluster algebra Aq(2,2), then S and D are naturally [formula]bases of quantum cluster algebra Aq(2,2) because there are have unipotent matrix transformations between [formula], [formula] and [formula]. In the following, we will focus on the set B and prove it is a [formula]basis of the quantum cluster algebra Aq(2,2).

By Proposition [\ref=5], we obtain that any element of the quantum cluster algebra Aq(2,2) can be a [formula]combination of the elemnets in the set B. Thus we only need to prove the elemnets in B are [formula]independent.

By Remark [\ref=7], we know that the elements [formula] associated to these minimal non-zero terms [formula] in the expansion of the elements in the set B are different from each other. Now we suppose that a finite [formula]combination of the elemnets in the set B is equal to 0. Let [formula] be the set of all α such that the corresponding element occurs with a non-zero coefficient in this [formula]combination. If S is non-empty, pick a minimal element α∈S, by Remark [\ref=6] and Remark [\ref=7], we know that Xα does not occur in the expansion of any other element in above equation which gives a contradiction. This completes the proof of the theorem.

[formula]

Then we can obtain the following corollary.

The sets , and [formula] are bar-invariant [formula]bases of the quantum cluster algebra Aq(2,2).

An representation-theoretic interpretation of the element sn

Recall we denote by Rp(n) the indecomposable regular modules with dimension vector (n,n) for n  ≥  1 and some [formula] of degree 1. In this section, we will prove that sn is equal to Xnδ for every [formula] The following proposition shows the Laurent expansion of Xm in Aq(2,2).

([\cite=lampe],[\cite=rupel]) For every n  ≥  0, we have

[formula]

For every [formula], we have

[formula]

It is easy to check that [formula] Assume that it holds for n  ≤  k, then

[formula]

Denote the quantum binomial coefficients [formula] and take [formula] for any [formula], [formula] for any l < 0, and [formula] for any 0  ≤  n < l. Then we have the following theorem proved in [\cite=Szanto]:

[\cite=Szanto] Let  = (a,b) for [formula]. Then for n  ≥  1,

[formula]

XRp(n) = sn for [formula].

By the q-deformation of the Caldero-Chapoton formula and Theorem [\ref=12], we have

[formula]

On the other hand, by Proposition [\ref=11], we have

[formula]

And

[formula]

Note that it is easy to confirm the following identity:

[formula]

Then by Lemma [\ref=10], we have

[formula]
