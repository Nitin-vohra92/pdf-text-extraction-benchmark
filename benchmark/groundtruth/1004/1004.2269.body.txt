Introduction and notations

The purpose of this paper is to study the arithmetic function [formula] defined by:

[formula]

We have for example [formula]. So it is clear that f(n) is not always an integer. However, we will show in what follows that f satisfies among others the property that the product of the f(r)'s (1  ≤  r  ≤  n) is always an integer and it is a multiple of all odd prime number not exceeding n. Further, we exploit the properties of f to establish some curious properties concerning the 2-adic valuation.

The study of f requires to introduce the two auxiliary arithmetic functions [formula] and [formula], defined by:

[formula]

[formula]

Remark that the product in the denominator of the right-hand side of ([\ref=eq2]) is actually finite because [formula] for any sufficiently large i; so h is well-defined.

Some notations and terminologies. Throughout this paper, we let [formula] denote the set [formula] of positive integers. For a given prime number p, we let vp denote the usual p-adic valuation. We define the odd part of a positive rational number α as the positive rational number, denoted Odd(α), so that we have α  =  2v2(α)  ·  Odd(α). Finally, we denote by ⌊.⌋ the integer-part function and we often use in this paper the following elementary well-known property of that function:

[formula]

Results and proofs

Let n be a positive integer. Then the product [formula] is an integer.

Proof. For a given [formula], let us write f(r) in terms of h(r). By writing r in the form [formula] ([formula], [formula] odd), we have by the definition of g:

[formula]

So, it follows that:

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

Using ([\ref=eq3]), we get for all [formula]:

[formula]

By taking the odd part of each of the two hand-sides of this last identity, we obtain:

[formula]

So, to confirm the statement of the theorem, it suffices to prove that the product [formula] is an integer for any [formula]. To do so, we lean on the following sample property of g:

[formula]

Using this, we have:

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

(Remark that the product in the denominator of the right-hand side of ([\ref=eq6]) is actually finite because [formula] for any sufficiently large i). Now, since [formula] then [formula] is a multiple of the multinomial coefficient [formula] which is an integer. Consequently [formula] is an integer, which completes this proof.[formula]

Let n be a positive integer. Then [formula] is a multiple of [formula]. In particular, [formula] is a multiple of all odd prime number not exceeding n.

Proof. According to the relations ([\ref=eq5]) and ([\ref=eq6]) obtained during the proof of Theorem [\ref=t1], it suffices to show that [formula] is a multiple of [formula]. Equivalently, it suffices to prove that for all prime number p, we have:

[formula]

where αp is the p-adic valuation of [formula], that is the greatest power of p not exceeding n. Let us show ([\ref=eq7]) for a given arbitrary prime number p. Using Legendre's formula (see e.g., [\cite=hw]), we have:

[formula]

Next, for all [formula], we have:

[formula]

But since [formula] ([formula]) is an integer, it follows that:

[formula]

By inserting those last inequalities in ([\ref=eq8]), we finally obtain:

[formula]

which confirms ([\ref=eq7]) and completes this proof.[formula]

For all positive integer n, we have:

[formula]

where [formula]. In addition, the inequality becomes an equality for n  =  1023  =  210  -  1.

Proof. First, we use the relation ([\ref=eq6]) to prove by induction on n that:

[formula]

[formula] For n  =  1, ([\ref=eq9]) is clearly true. [formula] For a given n  ≥  2, suppose that ([\ref=eq9]) is true for all positive integer <  n and let us show that ([\ref=eq9]) is also true for n. To do so, we distinguish the two following cases: 1 case: (if n is even, that is n  =  2m for some [formula]). In this case, by using ([\ref=eq6]) and the induction hypothesis, we have:

[formula]

as claimed. 2 case: (if n is odd, that is n  =  2m  +  1 for some [formula]). By using ([\ref=eq6]) and the induction hypothesis, we have:

[formula]

as claimed. The inequality ([\ref=eq9]) thus holds for all positive integer n. Now, to establish the inequality of the theorem, we proceed as follows: -- For n  ≤  70000, we simply verify the truth of the inequality in question (by using the Visual Basic language for example). -- For n  >  70000, it is easy to see that nlog 2n  ≤  (c / 4)n and by inserting this in ([\ref=eq9]), the inequality of the theorem follows. The proof is complete.[formula]

Now, since any positive integer n satisfies [formula] (according to ([\ref=eq5]) and the fact that [formula] is an integer), then we immediately derive from Theorem [\ref=t3] the following:

To improve Corollary [\ref=coll1], we propose the following optimal conjecture which is very probably true but it seems difficult to prove or disprove it!

For all positive integer n, we have:

[formula]

Using the Visual Basic language, we have checked the validity of Conjecture [\ref=conj1] up to n  =  100000. Further, by using elementary estimations similar to those used in the proof of Theorem [\ref=t3], we can easily show that:

[formula]

which shows in particular that the upper bound of Conjecture [\ref=conj1] is optimal.

Now, by exploiting the properties obtained above for the arithmetic function f, we are going to establish some curious properties concerning the 2-adic valuation.

For all positive integer n and all odd prime number p, we have:

[formula]

Proof. Let n be a positive integer and p be an odd prime number. Since (according to Theorem [\ref=t2]), the product [formula] is a multiple of the positive integer [formula] whose the p-adic valuation is equal to [formula], then we have:

[formula]

But by the definition of f, we have for all r  ≥  1:

[formula]

So, it follows that:

[formula]

which gives the inequality of the theorem.[formula]

Let n be a positive integer and let [formula] be the representation of n in the binary system. Then we have:

[formula]

In particular, we have for all [formula]:

[formula]

Proof. By taking the 2-adic valuation in the two hand-sides of the identity ([\ref=eq4]) and then using ([\ref=eq6]), we obtain:

[formula]

It follows by using Legendre's formula (see e.g., [\cite=hw]) that:

[formula]

By adding to the last series the telescopic series [formula] which is convergent with sum zero, we derive that:

[formula]

But according to the representation of n in the binary system, we have:

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

as required. The second part of the theorem is nothing else an immediate application of its first part with n  =  2m. The proof is finished.[formula]
