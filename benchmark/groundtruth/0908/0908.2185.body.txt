Lemma Proposition Definition Remark Example

Introduction

Let En be a complex vector space of dimension 2n and zn:En  →  En a nilpotent linear endomorphism with two nilpotent Jordan blocks, each of them of size n. A complete flag in En is an ascending sequence of linear subspaces [formula]. The (n,n) Springer variety is the set

[formula]

where a complete flag is said to be stabilized by zn if each of the subspaces Lj is stable under zn, i.e. if znLj  ⊂  Lj for all [formula].

It is known that [formula] is a complex projective variety of (complex) dimension n, and that the irreducible components of [formula] are topologically trivial (but algebraically non-trivial) iterated [formula]-bundles over a point (where [formula] is the complex projective line, i.e., topologically, [formula]). Moreover, a result of Fung [\cite=fung-2002] (going back to earlier work of Spaltenstein [\cite=spaltenstein-1976] and Vargas [\cite=vargas-1979]), describes the irreducible components of [formula] explicitly in terms of crossingless matchings of 2n points:

The irreducible components of [formula] are parametrized by crossingless matchings of 2n points. Furthermore, the irreducible component Ka associated to a∈Bn can be described explicitly, as follows:

[formula]

Here, Bn is the set of all crossingless matchings of 2n points. Elements of Bn can be thought of as diagrams consisting of n disjoint, nested cups, as in Figure [\ref=fig:cups]. Equivalently, elements of Bn are partitions of the set [formula] into pairs, such that there is no quadruple i < j < k < l with (i,k) and (j,l) paired. For an element a∈Bn, we denote by Oa the set of all i appearing in a pair (i,j)∈a with i < j; and if (i,j)∈a is a pair with i < j, then we define sa(i): = j and da(i): = (sa(i) - i + 1) / 2. Note that da(i) is always an integer because sa(i) - i - 1 is twice the number of cups that are contained strictly inside the cup with endpoints i and sa(i).

In [\cite=khovanov-2004-2], Khovanov proved that the integer cohomology ring of [formula] is isomorphic to the center of the ring [formula], defined in [\cite=MR1928174]. To show this, Khovanov first proved that [formula] has the same integer cohomology ring as a topological space [formula] (2n factors), defined by [formula], where

[formula]

The goal of this paper is to show the following stronger statement, which was also conjectured by Khovanov ([\cite=khovanov-2004-2]):

[formula] and [formula] are homeomorphic.

Our proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:main] is based on Proposition [\ref=prop:fung] and on the observation of Cautis and Kamnitzer [\cite=cautis-2007] that [formula] can be embedded into a (smooth) complex projective variety Y2n diffeomorphic to [formula]. Besides the diffeomorphism

[formula]

of Cautis and Kamnitzer, whose definition we review in Section [\ref=sec:diffeomorphism], we will need an involutive diffeomorphism

[formula]

defined by [formula] with

[formula]

where [formula] is the orthogonal complement (w.r.t. the standard hermitian product on [formula]) of the complex line [formula] (or, equivalently, the antipode of the point [formula]). In Section [\ref=sec:proof], we prove the following result, which implies Theorem [\ref=thm:main]:

The diffeomorphism [formula] maps Ka  ⊂  Y2n to [formula] for all a∈Bn, and hence [formula] to [formula].

The author had the main idea for this article in Spring 2007 while he was preparing a talk for an informal seminar on link homology and coherent sheaves organized by Mikhail Khovanov at Columbia University. In a recent article [\cite=russell-2008], Russell and Tymoczko studied an action of the symmetric group S2n on the cohomology ring of [formula]. In this context, they also proved Theorem [\ref=thm:main]. Although our proof is similar to theirs, our work is completely independent.

Diffeomorphism φm

In the following, E is the complex vector space [formula] (for some N > 0), and z:E  →  E is the nilpotent linear endomorphism given by zej: = ej - 1 and zfj: = fj - 1 for all [formula], and ze1: = zf1: = 0, where [formula] is the standard basis for the first [formula] summand in E, and [formula] is the standard basis of the second [formula] summand in E. For n  ≤  N, we denote by En  ⊂  E the subspace [formula], or equivalently, En = z- n(0) = (zn) = (zN - n), and we denote by 〈.,.〉E the standard hermitian product on E, satisfying

[formula]

for all [formula], and by 〈.,.〉 the standard hermitian product on [formula], satisfying

[formula]

where {e,f} is the standard basis of [formula].

Stable subspaces

A subspace W  ⊂  E is called stable under z if it satisfies zW  ⊂  W. Note that this condition also implies z2W  ⊂  zW and W  ⊂  z- 1W, so if W is stable under z, then so are its images and preimages under z. Moreover, if a stable subspace W satisfies W  ⊂  (z), then z:z- 1W  →  W is surjective and therefore

[formula]

where we have used that z- 1W  ⊃  z- 1(0) = (z) = E1. Let [formula] be the linear map defined by C(ej): = e and C(fj): = f for all [formula]. The following lemma is taken from [\cite=cautis-2007]:

If W  ⊂  E is stable under z and contained in (z), then the restriction [formula] is an isomotric isomorphism.

For the convenience of the reader, we recall the proof given in [\cite=cautis-2007].

Since [formula] is two-dimensional, it suffices to show that the restriction of C to [formula] is an isometry. For this, let [formula] with [formula] and [formula] where [formula]. Then we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

To prove that the restriction of C to [formula] is an isometry, i.e. that 〈v,w〉E  =  〈C(v),C(w)〉, we must therefore show [formula]. We will actually prove a stronger statement, namely that [formula] for each fixed k  ≠  0. Assuming k > 0 (the case k < 0 being similar), we can write

[formula]

and since [formula], we have [formula] and zkw∈zk(z- 1W)  ⊂  zk - 1W  ⊂  W, whence 〈v,zkw〉E = 0, as desired.

Let W  ⊂  E be a stable subspace such that   ⊂  W  ⊂  (z). Then z maps [formula] isomorphically to [formula], and the following diagram commutes:

It is apparent that [formula] is two-dimensional, and, by the previous lemma, C restricts to an isomorphism on [formula], so we only need to prove that z maps elements of [formula] to elements of [formula], and that the above diagram commutes. Thus, let [formula], and write v as

[formula]

for vj∈(ej,fj). Since [formula] and W  ⊃  (z) = E1  =  (e1,f1), we have v1 = 0, and since C(zvj) = C(vj) for all j  ≥  2, this implies C(zv) = C(v). We clearly have zv∈W (because v∈z- 1W), so the only thing that remains to be shown is that [formula]. For this, consider any w∈W and write w as [formula] for wj∈(ej,fj). Since 〈zvj,zwj〉E  =  〈vj,wj〉E for all j  ≥  2, and since v1 = 0 and [formula], we see that 〈zv,zw〉E  =  〈v,w〉E = 0, and thus [formula].

Ym and φm

For m  ≤  N, Cautis and Kamnitzer [\cite=cautis-2007] define a complex projective variety Ym,

[formula]

where Fm is the set of all partial flags [formula]. Note that the conditions zLj  ⊂  Lj and zLj - 1  ⊂  Lj - 1 imply that z descends to an endomorphism of Lj / Lj - 1, and since Lj / Lj - 1 is one-dimensional and z nilpotent, this endomorphism must be the zero-map, so the spaces Lj in [formula] actually satisfy the seemingly stronger condition zLj  ⊂  Lj - 1. In particular, [formula], so as far as the definition of Ym is concerned, we could restrict ourselves to the space [formula] instead of working with the bigger space [formula]. In particular, Ym is independent of the choice of N (as long as N  ≥  m).

Note also that the assignment [formula] defines a [formula]-bundle Ym  →  Ym - 1. Indeed, a point in the fiber above [formula] is obtained from [formula] by choosing an Lm such that Lm - 1  ⊂  Lm  ⊂  z- 1Lm - 1, and since z- 1Lm - 1 / Lm - 1 is two-dimensional, we have a [formula] worth of choices. Denoting by [formula] the orthogonal complement of Lj - 1 w.r.t. 〈.,.〉E, we can identify z- 1Lm - 1 / Lm - 1 with [formula], and by Lemma [\ref=lemma:isomorphism], the map [formula] identifies [formula] with [formula]. Therefore, the [formula]-bundle Ym  →  Ym - 1 is topologically trivial (i.e., topologically, [formula]), and Cautis and Kamnitzer use this to define a diffeomorphism

[formula]

by [formula].

Subvarieties Xm,i  ⊂  Ym

For each [formula], Cautis and Kamnitzer [\cite=cautis-2007] define a subvariety Xm,i  ⊂  Ym,

[formula]

together with a surjection

[formula]

given by [formula]. The following (easy) Lemma was shown in [\cite=cautis-2007].

The map [formula] takes Xi,m diffeomorphically to

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the orthogonal complement of the line [formula] w.r.t. 〈.,.〉.

Let [formula] be the forgetful map sending [formula] to [formula], and let

[formula]

be the restriction of fm,i to Am,i.

Let ψm,i:Xm,i  →  Am,i be the restriction of φm to Xm,i  ⊂  Ym. Then the following diagram commutes:

[formula]

It is straightforward to check that [formula] maps [formula] to the tuple [formula], where

[formula]

and [formula] maps [formula] to the tuple [formula], where

[formula]

To prove [formula], we must therefore show that

[formula]

holds for all j  ≥  i. But if j  ≥  i, then Lj + 1  ⊃  Li + 1 = z- 1Li - 1  ⊃  z- 1(0) = (z), and (by increasing N if necessary) we can also assume that Lj + 1  ⊂  (z). Thus, Lemma [\ref=lemma:key] applied to W: = Lj + 1 tells us that z maps [formula] to [formula], and that C(v) = C(zv) for all [formula]. Now the equality [formula] follows because z maps [formula] to [formula].

Proof of Proposition [\ref=prop:main]

In this section, we use the same notations as before, except that we now assume m = 2n (and hence N  ≥  2n). Then the Springer variety [formula] is naturally contained in Y2n as

[formula]

where [formula], and Proposition [\ref=prop:fung] tells us that the irreducible component [formula] associated to the crossingless matching a∈Bn is equal to the set of all [formula] satisfying

[formula]

for all j∈Oa, where zn:En  →  En is the restriction of z to En. A priori, z- da(j)nLj - 1 could a priori be a proper subspace of z- da(j)Lj - 1 (because z- da(j)Lj - 1 might not be contained in En), but it turns out that z- da(j)nLj - 1 is equal to z- da(j)Lj - 1 whenever [formula]. In fact, we have:

[formula].

Suppose [formula] is contained in Ka. Then the condition z- da(j)nLj - 1 = Lsa(j), combined with (Lj - 1) = j - 1, (Lsa(j)) = sa(j), and ((z)) = 2, implies

[formula]

and thus z- da(j)Lj - 1 = z- da(j)nLj - 1. Conversely, suppose [formula] satisfies z- da(j)Lj - 1 = Lsa(j) for all j∈Oa. Then we must show that L2n = En. To prove this, let us call a pair (k,l)∈a outermost if there is no pair (k',l')∈a such that k' < k < l < l'. Then the outermost pairs in a form a sequence [formula] such that k1 = 1, lr = 2n, and ks + 1 = ls + 1 for all s < r, and [formula]. Using z- da(j)Lj - 1 = Lsa(j) successively for [formula], we obtain

[formula]

as desired.

From now on, a∈Bn is a fixed crossingless matching of 2n points, and i is an index such that sa(i) = i + 1, i.e., such that (i,i + 1) is a pair in a. We denote by a'∈Bn - 1 the crossingless matching obtained from a by removing the pair (i,i + 1) (and renumbering indices j  ≥  i + 2 such that [formula] becomes [formula]), and by q the map q2n,i:X2n,i  →  Y2n - 2, defined as in the previous section.

Ka = q- 1(Ka').

Since sa(i) = i + 1 and da(i) = (sa(i) - i + 1) / 2 = 1, the equality Li + 1 = z- 1Li - 1 holds for each [formula], and thus Ka  ⊂  Y2n is contained in X2n,i. It remains to show that an element [formula] satisfies the conditions Lsaj = z- da(j)Lj - 1 for all [formula] if and only if the element [formula] satisfies the conditions L'sa'(j) = z- da'(j)L'j - 1 for all j∈Oa'. We divide the proof into three cases.

Case 1. If j < sa(j) < i, then the equivalence

[formula]

is obvious because the quantities appearing on either side of [formula] are identical.

Case 2. If j < i < i + 1 < sa(j), then L'j - 1 = Lj - 1, L'sa'(j) = zLsa(j), and da'(j) = da(j) - 1, so we must show:

[formula]

But this follows simply by applying z (resp., z- 1) to the equalities on either side of [formula], and observing that z- 1(zLsa(j)) = Lsa(j) (because Lsa(j)  ⊃  Li + 1 = z- 1Li - 1  ⊃  z- 1(0) = (z)), and that z(z- da(j)Lj - 1) = z- da(j) + 1Lj - 1 (because, by increasing N if necessary, we may assume z- da(j) + 1Lj - 1  ⊂  (z)).

Case 3. If i + 1 < j < sa(j), then L'j - 3 = zLj - 1, Lsa'(j - 2) = zLsa(j), and da'(j - 2) = da(j), so we must show:

[formula]

As in Case 2, this follows by applying z (resp., z- 1) to the equalities on either side of [formula].

Note that (since sa(j) - j is odd for all j∈Oa) the involutive diffeomorphism [formula] defined in the introduction exchanges the subset [formula] with the subset

[formula]

To prove Proposition [\ref=prop:main], we must therefore show that φ2n maps Ka to Ta for all a∈Bn. We will need the following lemma, in which a, i and a' are as in the previous lemma, and g denotes the map [formula], defined as in the previous section.

Ta = g- 1(Ta').

This follows directly from the definitions of g, A2n,i, Ta and Ta'.

We are now ready to prove Proposition [\ref=prop:main].

Induction on n. The case n = 1 is trivial because the only crossingless matching of 2 points is a1: = {(1,2)}, and [formula] maps [formula] diffeomorphically to [formula].

Thus, let n > 1, and suppose we have already proven the proposition for n - 1. Let a∈Bn. Then there is an [formula] such that sa(i) = i + 1, i.e., such that (i,i + 1)∈a. As above, we denote by a'∈Bn - 1 the crossingless matching obtained from a by removing the pair (i,i + 1) (and renumbering all j  ≥  i + 2), and by q (resp., g) the map q2n,i (resp., g2n,i). By induction, we know that φ2n - 2 maps Ka' to Ta', so Lemma [\ref=lemma:commute] gives us the following commutative diagram:

[formula]

Hence we get ψ2n,i(q- 1(Ka')) = g- 1(Ta'), and by Lemmas [\ref=lemma:q] and [\ref=lemma:g], this implies

[formula]

thus completing the inductive step.
