Characterizing meager paratopological groups

Trying to find a counterpart of the Lindeföf property in the category of topological groups I.Guran [\cite=Gu] introduced the notion of an ω-bounded group which turned out to be very fruitful in topological algebra, see [\cite=Tk]. We recall that a topological group G is ω-bounded if for each non-empty open subset U  ⊂  G there is a countable subset C  ⊂  G such that CU = G = UC.

A similar approach to the Baire category leads us to the notion of an shift-meager (shift-Baire) group. This is a topological group that can(not) be written as the union of countably many translation copies of some fixed nowhere dense subset.

The notion of a shift-meager (shift-Baire) group can be defined in a more general context of semitopological groups, that is, groups G endowed with a shift-invariant topology τ. The latter is equivalent to saying that the group operation ·  :G  ×  G  →  G is separately continuous. If this operation is jointly continuous, then (G,τ) is called a paratopological group.

A semitopological group G is defined to be

left meager (resp. right meager) if G = CA (resp. G = AC) for some nowhere dense subset A  ⊂  X and some countable subset C  ⊂  G;

shift-meager if G is both left and right meager;

left Baire (resp. right Baire) if for every open dense subset U  ⊂  X and every countable subset C  ⊂  G the intersection [formula] (resp. [formula]) is dense in G;

shift-Baire if G is both left and right Baire.

For semitopological groups those notions relate as follows:

The following theorem implies that for Hausdorff paratopological groups all the eight properties from this diagram are equivalent.

A Hausdorff paratopological group G is meager if and only if G is shift-meager.

This theorem will be proved in Section [\ref=pf]. The proof is based on Theorem [\ref=t2] giving conditions under which a meager semitopological group is left (right) meager and Theorem [\ref=osc] describing some oscillator properties of 2-saturated Hausdorff paratopological groups.

Shift-meager semitopological groups

In this section we search for conditions under which a given meager semitopological group is left (right) meager.

Let us define a subset A  ⊂  G of a group G to be

left large (resp. right large) if G = FA (resp. G = AF) for some finite subset F  ⊂  G;

left P-small (resp. right P-small) if there is an infinite subset B  ⊂  G such that the indexed family {bA}b∈B (resp. {Ab}b∈B) is disjoint.

A meager semitopological group G is left (right) meager provided one of the following conditions holds:

G contains a non-empty open left (right) P-small subset;

G contains a sequence (Un)n∈ω of pairwise disjoint open left (right) large subsets;

G contains sequences of non-empty open sets (Un)n∈ω and points (gn)n∈ω such that the sets gnUnU- 1n (resp. U- 1nUngn), [formula], are pairwise disjoint.

(1l) Assume that U  ⊂  G is a non-empty open left P-small subset. We may assume that U is a neighborhood of the neutral element e of G. It follows that there is a countable subset B  ⊂  G such that [formula] for any distinct points b,b'∈B. The countable set B generates a countable subgroup H of G. By an H-cylinder we shall understand an open subset of the form HVg where g∈G and V  ⊂  U is a neighborhood of e. Let U  =  {HVαgα:α∈A} be a maximal family of H-cylinders in G (such a family exists by the Zorn Lemma).

We claim that [formula] is dense in G. Assuming the converse, we could find a point [formula] and a neighborhood V  ⊂  U of e such that [formula]. Taking into account that [formula], we conclude that [formula] and hence [formula] is a disjoint family of H-cylinders that enlarges the family U, which contradicts the maximality of U. Therefore [formula] is dense in G and hence [formula] is a closed nowhere dense subset of G.

The space G, being meager, can be written as the union [formula] of a sequence (Mn)n∈ω of nowhere dense subsets of G. It is easy to see that the set

[formula]

is nowhere dense in G and G = HM, witnessing that G is left meager.

(2l) Assume that G contains a sequence (Un)n∈ω of pairwise disjoint open left large subsets. For every n∈ω find a finite subset Fn  ⊂  G with G = Fn  ·  Un. Write [formula] as countable union of nowhere dense subsets and observe that for every n∈ω the subset [formula] of Un is nowhere dense. Since the family {Un}n∈ω is disjoint, the set

[formula]

is nowhere dense in G. Since [formula], the semitopological group G is left meager.

(3l) Assume that (Un)n∈ω is a sequence of non-empty open subsets of G and (gn)n∈ω is a sequence of points of G such that the sets gnUnU- 1n, n∈ω, are pairwise disjoint. Using the Zorn Lemma, for every n∈ω we can choose a maximal subset Fn  ⊂  G such that the indexed family {xUn}x∈Fn is disjoint. If for some n∈ω the set Fn is infinite, then the set Un is left P-small and consequently, the group G is left meager by the first item. So, assume that each set Fn, n∈ω, is finite. The maximality of Fn implies that for every x∈G there is y∈Fn such that [formula]. Then x∈yUnU- 1n and hence G = FnUnU- 1n, which means that the open set UnU- 1n is left large. Since the family {gnUnU- 1n}n∈ω is disjoint, it is legal to apply the second item to conclude that the group G is left meager.

(1r) - (3r). The right versions of the items (1)-(3) can be proved by analogy.

Oscillation properties of paratopological groups

In this section we establish some oscillation properties of 2-saturated paratopological groups. First, we recall the definition of oscillator topologies on a given paratopological group (G,τ), see [\cite=BR] for more details.

Given a subset U  ⊂  G, by induction define subsets (  ±  U)n and (  ∓  U)n, n∈ω, of G letting (  ±  U)0 = (  ∓  U)0  =  {e} and (  ±  U)n + 1 = U(  ∓  U)n, (  ∓  U)n + 1 = U- 1(  ±  U)n for n  ≥  0. Thus [formula]  and [formula]. Note that ((  ±  U)n)- 1 = (  ±  U)n if n is even and ((  ±  U)n)- 1 = (  ∓  U)n if n is odd.

By an n-oscillator (resp. a mirror n-oscillator) on a topological group (G,τ) we understand a set of the form (  ±  U)n (resp. (  ∓  U)n ) for some neighborhood U of the unit of G. Observe that each n-oscillator in a paratopological group (G,τ) is a mirror n-oscillator in the mirror paratopological group (G,τ- 1) and vice versa: each mirror n-oscillator in (G,τ) is an n-oscillator in (G,τ- 1).

By the n-oscillator topology on a paratopological group (G,τ) we understand the topology τn consisting of sets U  ⊂  G such that for each x∈U there is an n-oscillator (  ±  V)n with x  ·  (  ±  V)n  ⊂  U.

Let us recall that a paratopological group (G,τ) is saturated if each non-empty open set U  ⊂  G has non-empty interior in the mirror topology τ- 1  =  {U- 1:U∈τ}. This notion can be generalized as follows.

Define a paratopological group (G,τ) to be n-saturated if each non-empty open set U∈τn has non-empty interior in the topology (τ- 1)n.

A paratopological group (G,τ) is 2-saturated if no non-empty open subset U  ⊂  G is P-small.

To prove that G is 2-saturated, take any non-empty open set U2∈τ2 and find a point x∈U2 and a neighborhood U∈τ of e such that xU2U- 2  ⊂  U2. By the Zorn Lemma, there is a maximal subset B  ⊂  G such that [formula] for all distinct points b,b'∈B. By our hypothesis, U is not P-small, which implies that the set B is finite. The maximality of B implies that for each x∈G the shift xU meets some shift bU, b∈U. Consequently, x∈bUU- 1 and [formula]. It follows that the closure [formula] of UU- 1 in the topology (τ- 1)2 has non-empty interior. We claim that [formula]. Indeed, given any point [formula], we conclude that the neighborhood U- 1zU of z in the topology (τ- 1)2 meets UU- 1 and hence z∈U2U- 2. Now we see that the set

[formula]

has non-empty interior in the topology (τ- 1)2, witnessing that the group (G,τ) is 2-saturated.

By Proposition 2 of [\cite=BR], for each saturated paratopological group (G,τ) the semitopological group (G,τ2) is a topological group. This results generalizes to n-saturated groups.

If (G,τ) is an n-saturated paratopological group for some [formula], then (G,τ2n) is a topological group.

According to Theorem 1 of [\cite=BR], (G,τ2n) is a topological group if and only if for every neighborhood U∈τ of the neutral element e∈G there is a neighborhood V∈τ of e such that (  ∓  V)2n  ⊂  (  ±  U)2n.

Since the paratopological group (G,τ) is n-saturated, the set (  ±  U)n∈τ2 contains an interior point x in the mirror topology (τ- 1)n. Consequently, there is a neighborhood V∈τ of e such that (  ∓  V)nx  ⊂  (  ±  U)n.

Now we consider separately the cases of odd and even n.

1. If n is odd, then applying the operation of the inversion to (  ∓  V)nx  ⊂  (  ±  U)n, we get x- 1(  ±  V)n  ⊂  (  ∓  U)n and then

[formula]

2. If n is even, then (  ∓  V)nx  ⊂  (  ±  U)n implies x- 1(  ∓  V)n  ⊂  (  ±  U)n and

[formula]

According to [\cite=BR], for each 1-saturated Hausdorff paratopological groups (G,τ) the group (G,τ2) is a Hausdorff topological group. For 2-saturated group we have a bit weaker result.

For any non-discrete Hausdorff 2-saturated paratopological group (G,τ) the maximal antidiscrete subgroup [formula] of the topological group (G,τ4) is nowhere dense in the topology τ2.

To show that [formula] is nowhere dense in the topology τ2, fix any non-empty open set U2∈τ2. Since G is not discrete, so is the topology τ2  ⊂  τ. Consequently, we can find a point [formula]. Since G is a Hausdorff paratopological group, there is a neighborhood U∈τ of e such that e∉xUU- 1  ⊂  U2. The continuity of the group operation yields a neighborhood V∈τ of e such that V2  ⊂  U and V2x  ⊂  xU. Then [formula] yields [formula]. Using the shift-invariantness of the topology τ, find a neighborhood W∈τ of e such that W  ⊂  V and xW  ⊂  Vx.

Since the group G is 2-saturated, the open set xWW- 1∈τ2 has non-empty interior in the topology (τ- 1)2. Consequently, there is a point y∈xWW- 1 and a neighborhood O∈τ of e such that O  ⊂  W and O- 1yO  ⊂  xWW- 1. Observe that

[formula]

and consequently, [formula].

Can the topology τ2n be antidiscrete for some Hausdorff n-saturated paratopological group?

Assume that a paratopological group (G,τ) is 2-saturated. Is its mirror paratopological group (G,τ- 1) 2-saturated?

Proof of Theorem [\ref=main]

We need to check that each meager Hausdorff paratopological group G is left and right meager.

If the paratopological group G contains a non-empty open left P-small subset, then G is left meager by Theorem [\ref=t2](1). So assume that no non-empty open subset of G is left P-small. In this case Proposition [\ref=p1] implies that the paratopological group G is 2-saturated while Theorem [\ref=t4] ensures that the topological group (G,τ4) contains a countable disjoint family {Wn}n∈ω of non-empty open sets. By the definition of the 4th oscillator topology τ4 each set Wn contains a subset of the form xnUnU- 1UnU- 1n where xn∈G and Un is a neighborhood of the neutral element in the paratopological group G. Since the sets xnUnU- 1n  ⊂  Wn, n∈ω, are pairwise disjoint, we can apply Theorem [\ref=t2](3) to conclude that the paratopological group G is left meager.

By analogy we can prove that G is right meager.

Discussion and Open Problems

The following example shows that without any restrictions, a meager semi-topological group needs not be shift-meager.

Let G be an uncountable group whose cardinality |G| has countable cofinality. Endow the group G with the shift-invariant topology generated by the base [formula]. It is easy to see that a subset A  ⊂  G is nowhere dense if and only if it is not dense if and only if |A| < |G|. This observation implies that G is meager (because |G| has countable cofinality). On the other hand, the semi-topological group G is not shift-meager because for every nowhere dense subset A  ⊂  G and every countable subset C  ⊂  G we get |A| < |G| and hence G  ≠  CA because [formula].

Is each meager paratopological group G shift-meager?

Is each meager Hausdorff semitopological group shift-meager?

Is each left meager semitopological group right meager?

Also we do not know is the following semigroup version of Theorem [\ref=main] holds.

Let S be an open meager subsemigroup of a Hausdorff paratopological group G. Is S  ⊂  CA for some nowhere dense subset A  ⊂  S and a countable subset C  ⊂  G?
