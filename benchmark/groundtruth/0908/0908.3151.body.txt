Tridiagonal pairs of q-Racah type and the μ-conjecture

Kazumasa Nomura and Paul Terwilliger

Abstract

Let [formula] denote a field and let V denote a vector space over [formula] with finite positive dimension. We consider a pair of linear transformations A:V  →  V and A*:V  →  V that satisfy the following conditions: (i) each of A,A* is diagonalizable; (ii) there exists an ordering {Vi}di = 0 of the eigenspaces of A such that A*Vi  ⊆  Vi - 1  +  Vi  +  Vi + 1 for 0  ≤  i  ≤  d, where V- 1 = 0 and Vd + 1 = 0; (iii) there exists an ordering {V*i}δi = 0 of the eigenspaces of A* such that AV*i  ⊆  V*i - 1  +  V*i  +  V*i + 1 for 0  ≤  i  ≤  δ, where V*- 1 = 0 and V*δ + 1 = 0; (iv) there is no subspace W of V such that AW  ⊆  W, A*W  ⊆  W, W  ≠  0, W  ≠  V. We call such a pair a tridiagonal pair on V. It is known that d = δ and for 0  ≤  i  ≤  d the dimensions of Vi, Vd - i, V*i, V*d - i coincide. We say the pair A,A* is sharp whenever dim V0 = 1. It is known that if [formula] is algebraically closed then A,A* is sharp. A conjectured classification of the sharp tridiagonal pairs was recently introduced by T. Ito and the second author. Shortly afterwards we introduced a conjecture, called the μ-conjecture, which implies the classification conjecture. In this paper we show that the μ-conjecture holds in a special case called q-Racah.

Tridiagonal pairs

Throughout the paper [formula] denotes a field.

We begin by recalling the notion of a tridiagonal pair. We will use the following terms. Let V denote a vector space over [formula] with finite positive dimension. For a linear transformation A:V  →  V and a subspace W  ⊆  V, we call W an eigenspace of A whenever [formula] and there exists [formula] such that W = {v∈V  |  Av  =  θv}; in this case θ is the eigenvalue of A associated with W. We say that A is diagonalizable whenever V is spanned by the eigenspaces of A.

Let V denote a vector space over [formula] with finite positive dimension. By a tridiagonal pair on V we mean an ordered pair of linear transformations A:V  →  V and A*:V  →  V that satisfy the following four conditions.

Each of A,A* is diagonalizable.

There exists an ordering {Vi}di = 0 of the eigenspaces of A such that

[formula]

where V- 1  =  0 and Vd + 1  =  0.

There exists an ordering {V*i}δi = 0 of the eigenspaces of A* such that

[formula]

where V*- 1  =  0 and V*δ + 1  =  0.

There does not exist a subspace W of V such that AW  ⊆  W, A*W  ⊆  W, [formula], [formula].

We say that the pair A,A* is over [formula].

According to a common notational convention A* denotes the conjugate-transpose of A. We are not using this convention. In a tridiagonal pair A,A* the linear transformations A and A* are arbitrary subject to (i)-(iv) above.

We refer the reader to [\cite=TD00] [\cite=shape] [\cite=nomsharp] [\cite=nomtowards] [\cite=nomstructure] [\cite=NT:muconj] [\cite=LS99] [\cite=qrac] [\cite=madrid] [\cite=tdanduq] [\cite=NN] [\cite=qtet] [\cite=Ev] [\cite=IT:Krawt] [\cite=IT:qRacah] for background on tridiagonal pairs.

In order to motivate our results we recall some facts about tridiagonal pairs. Let A,A* denote a tridiagonal pair on V, as in Definition [\ref=def:tdp]. By [\cite=TD00] the integers d and δ from (ii), (iii) are equal; we call this common value the diameter of the pair. An ordering of the eigenspaces of A (resp. A*) is said to be standard whenever it satisfies [\eqref=eq:t1] (resp. [\eqref=eq:t2]). We comment on the uniqueness of the standard ordering. Let {Vi}di = 0 denote a standard ordering of the eigenspaces of A. By [\cite=TD00], the ordering {Vd - i}di = 0 is also standard and no further ordering is standard. A similar result holds for the eigenspaces of A*. Let {Vi}di = 0 (resp. {V*i}di = 0) denote a standard ordering of the eigenspaces of A (resp. A*). By [\cite=TD00], for 0  ≤  i  ≤  d the spaces Vi, V*i have the same dimension; we denote this common dimension by ρi. By [\cite=TD00] the sequence {ρi}di = 0 is symmetric and unimodal; that is ρi  =  ρd - i for 0  ≤  i  ≤  d and ρi - 1  ≤  ρi for 1  ≤  i  ≤  d / 2. We call the sequence {ρi}di = 0 the shape of A,A*. We say A,A* is sharp whenever ρ0 = 1. If [formula] is algebraically closed then A,A* is sharp [\cite=nomstructure].

We now summarize the present paper. A conjectured classification of the sharp tridiagonal pairs was introduced in [\cite=IT:Krawt] and studied carefully in [\cite=nomsharp] [\cite=nomtowards] [\cite=nomstructure]; see Conjecture [\ref=conj:main] below. Shortly afterwards we introduced a conjecture, called the μ-conjecture, which implies the classification conjecture. The μ-conjecture is roughly described as follows. We start with a sequence p = ({θi}di = 0;{θ*i}di = 0) of scalars taken from [formula] that satisfy the known constraints on the eigenvalues of a tridiagonal pair over [formula] of diameter d; these are conditions (i), (ii) of Conjecture [\ref=conj:main]. Following [\cite=nomstructure] we associate with p an associative [formula]-algebra T defined by generators and relations; see Definition [\ref=def:T] below. We are interested in the [formula]-algebra e*0Te*0 where e*0 is a certain idempotent element of T. Let {xi}di = 1 denote mutually commuting indeterminates. Let [formula] denote the [formula]-algebra consisting of the polynomials in {xi}di = 1 that have all coefficients in [formula]. In [\cite=NT:muconj] we displayed a surjective [formula]-algebra homomorphism [formula]. The μ-conjecture [\cite=NT:muconj] asserts that μ is an isomorphism. We have shown that the μ-conjecture implies the classification conjecture [\cite=NT:muconj] and that the μ-conjecture holds for d  ≤  5 [\cite=NT:muconj]. In the present paper we obtain the following additional evidence that the μ-conjecture is true. There is a general class of parameters p said to have q-Racah type [\cite=IT:qRacah]. In [\cite=IT:qRacah] T. Ito and the second author verified the classification conjecture for the case in which p has q-Racah type and [formula] is algebraically closed; see Proposition [\ref=prop:ITqRacah] below. Making heavy use of this result, we verify the μ-conjecture for the case in which p has q-Racah type, with no restriction on [formula]. Our main result is Theorem [\ref=thm:main]. On our way to Theorem [\ref=thm:main] we obtain two related results Theorem [\ref=thm:A] and [\ref=thm:FK], which might be of independent interest.

Tridiagonal systems

When working with a tridiagonal pair, it is often convenient to consider a closely related object called a tridiagonal system. To define a tridiagonal system, we recall a few concepts from linear algebra. Let V denote a vector space over [formula] with finite positive dimension. Let [formula] denote the [formula]-algebra of all linear transformations from V to V. Let A denote a diagonalizable element of [formula]. Let {Vi}di = 0 denote an ordering of the eigenspaces of A and let {θi}di = 0 denote the corresponding ordering of the eigenvalues of A. For 0  ≤  i  ≤  d define [formula] such that (Ei - I)Vi = 0 and EiVj = 0 for j  ≠  i (0  ≤  j  ≤  d). Here I denotes the identity of [formula]. We call Ei the primitive idempotent of A corresponding to Vi (or θi). Observe that (i) [formula]; (ii) EiEj  =  δi,jEi (0  ≤  i,j  ≤  d); (iii) Vi = EiV (0  ≤  i  ≤  d); (iv) [formula]. Moreover

[formula]

Now let A,A* denote a tridiagonal pair on V. An ordering of the primitive idempotents or eigenvalues of A (resp. A*) is said to be standard whenever the corresponding ordering of the eigenspaces of A (resp. A*) is standard.

[\cite=TD00] Let V denote a vector space over [formula] with finite positive dimension. By a tridiagonal system on V we mean a sequence

[formula]

that satisfies (i)-(iii) below.

A,A* is a tridiagonal pair on V.

{Ei}di = 0 is a standard ordering of the primitive idempotents of A.

{E*i}di = 0 is a standard ordering of the primitive idempotents of A*.

We say Φ is over [formula]. We call V the vector space underlying Φ.

The notion of isomorphism for tridiagonal systems is defined in [\cite=nomsharp]. The following result is immediate from lines [\eqref=eq:t1], [\eqref=eq:t2] and Definition [\ref=def:TDsystem].

Let (A;{Ei}di = 0;A*;{E*i}di = 0) denote a tridiagonal system. Then for 0  ≤  i,j,k  ≤  d the following (i), (ii) hold.

EiA * kEj  =  0     if k < |i - j|.

E*iAkE*j = 0     if k < |i - j|.

Let Φ = (A;{Ei}di = 0;A*;{E*i}di = 0) denote a tridiagonal system on V. For 0  ≤  i  ≤  d let θi (resp. θ*i) denote the eigenvalue of A (resp. A*) associated with the eigenspace EiV (resp. E*iV). We call {θi}di = 0 (resp. {θ*i}di = 0) the eigenvalue sequence (resp. dual eigenvalue sequence) of Φ. We observe that {θi}di = 0 (resp. {θ*i}di = 0) are mutually distinct and contained in [formula]. We say Φ is sharp whenever the tridiagonal pair A,A* is sharp.

Let Φ denote a tridiagonal system over [formula] with eigenvalue sequence {θi}di = 0 and dual eigenvalue sequence {θ*i}di = 0. By [\cite=TD00] the expressions

[formula]

are equal and independent of i for 2  ≤  i  ≤  d - 1. For this constraint the "most general" solution is

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the algebraic closure of [formula]. For this solution q2 + q- 2 + 1 is the common value of [\eqref=eq:indep0]. The tridiagonal system Φ is said to have q-Racah type whenever [\eqref=eq:1]-[\eqref=eq:4] hold. The following definition is more general.

Let d denote a nonnegative integer and let ({θi}di = 0;{θ*i}di = 0) denote a sequence of scalars taken from [formula]. We call this sequence q-Racah whenever the following (i), (ii) hold.

θi  ≠  θj, θ*i  ≠  θ*j if i  ≠  j (0  ≤  i,j  ≤  d).

There exist q,a,b,c,a*,b*,c* that satisfy [\eqref=eq:1]-[\eqref=eq:4].

We will return to the subject of q-Racah a bit later. We now recall the split sequence of a sharp tridiagonal system. We will use the following notation.

Let λ denote an indeterminate and let [formula] denote the [formula]-algebra consisting of the polynomials in λ that have all coefficients in [formula]. Let d denote a nonnegative integer and let ({θi}di = 0;{θ*i}di = 0) denote a sequence of scalars taken from [formula]. Then for 0  ≤  i  ≤  d we define the following polynomials in [formula]:

[formula]

Note that each of τi, ηi, τ*i, η*i is monic with degree i.

Let (A;{Ei}di = 0;A*;{E*i}di = 0) denote a sharp tridiagonal system over [formula], with eigenvalue sequence {θi}di = 0 and dual eigenvalue sequence {θ*i}di = 0. By [\cite=nomstructure], for 0  ≤  i  ≤  d there exists a unique [formula] such that

[formula]

Note that ζ0 = 1. We call {ζi}di = 0 the split sequence of the tridiagonal system.

[\cite=nomsharp] Let Φ denote a sharp tridiagonal system. By the parameter array of Φ we mean the sequence ({θi}di = 0;{θ*i}di = 0;{ζi}di = 0) where {θi}di = 0 (resp. {θ*i}di = 0) is the eigenvalue sequence (resp. dual eigenvalue sequence) of Φ and {ζi}di = 0 is the split sequence of Φ.

The classification conjecture

To motivate our results we recall a conjectured classification of the tridiagonal systems due to T. Ito and the second author.

Let d denote a nonnegative integer and let

[formula]

denote a sequence of scalars taken from [formula]. Then there exists a sharp tridiagonal system Φ over [formula] with parameter array [\eqref=eq:parray] if and only if (i)-(iii) hold below.

θi  ≠  θj, θ*i  ≠  θ*j if i  ≠  j (0  ≤  i,j  ≤  d).

The expressions

[formula]

are equal and independent of i for 2  ≤  i  ≤  d - 1.

ζ0 = 1, ζd  ≠  0 and

[formula]

Suppose (i)-(iii) hold. Then Φ is unique up to isomorphism of tridiagonal systems.

In [\cite=nomsharp] we proved the "only if" direction of Conjecture [\ref=conj:main]. In [\cite=nomstructure] we proved the last assertion of Conjecture [\ref=conj:main]. Concerning the "if" direction of Conjecture [\ref=conj:main], we proved this for d  ≤  5 in [\cite=NT:muconj]. We also have the following result due to T. Ito and the second author.

Assume [formula] is algebraically closed. Let d denote a nonnegative integer and let ({θi}di = 0;{θ*i}di = 0) denote a sequence of scalars taken from [formula] that is q-Racah in the sense of Definition [\ref=def:qRacah]. Let {ζi}di = 0 denote a sequence of scalars taken from [formula] that satisfies condition (iii) of Conjecture [\ref=conj:main]. Then there exists a sharp tridiagonal system over [formula] that has parameter array ({θi}di = 0;{θ*i}di = 0;{ζi}di = 0).

The μ-conjecture

In this section we recall the μ-conjecture. It has to do with the following algebra.

Let d denote a nonnegative integer, and let p = ({θi}di = 0;{θ*i}di = 0) denote a sequence of scalars taken from [formula] that satisfies conditions (i), (ii) of Conjecture [\ref=conj:main]. Let [formula] denote the associative [formula]-algebra with 1, defined by generators a, {ei}di = 0, a*, {e*i}di = 0 and relations

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

The algebra T is related to tridiagonal systems as follows.

Let V denote a vector space over [formula] with finite positive dimension. Let (A;{Ei}di = 0;A*;{E*i}di = 0) denote a tridiagonal system on V with eigenvalue sequence {θi}di = 0 and dual eigenvalue sequence {θ*i}di = 0. For the sequence p = ({θi}di = 0;{θ*i}di = 0) let [formula] denote the algebra from Definition [\ref=def:T]. Then there exists a unique T-module structure on V such that a, a*, ei, e*i acts on V as A, A*, Ei, E*i, respectively. Moreover this T-module is irreducible.

For the rest of this section, let d denote a nonnegative integer and let p = ({θi}di = 0;{θ*i}di = 0) denote a sequence of scalars taken from [formula] that satisfies conditions (i), (ii) of Conjecture [\ref=conj:main]. Let [formula] denote the corresponding algebra from Definition [\ref=def:T]. Observe that e*0Te*0 is a [formula]-algebra with multiplicative identity e*0.

The algebra e*0Te*0 is commutative and generated by

[formula]

Let {xi}di = 1 denote mutually commuting indeterminates. We denote by [formula] the [formula]-algebra consisting of the polynomials in {xi}di = 1 that have all coefficients in [formula].

From Lemma [\ref=lem:commute] we immediately obtain the following.

There exists a surjective [formula]-algebra homomorphism

[formula]

that sends xi  ↦  e*0τi(a)e*0 for 1  ≤  i  ≤  d.

The following conjecture was introduced in [\cite=NT:muconj].

The map μ from Lemma [\ref=lem:mu] is an isomorphism.

We have shown that the μ-conjecture implies Conjecture [\ref=conj:main] [\cite=NT:muconj], and that the μ-conjecture holds for d  ≤  5 [\cite=NT:muconj]. In this paper we prove Conjecture [\ref=conj:mainp] for the case in which p is q-Racah. In our proof we make heavy use of Proposition [\ref=prop:ITqRacah]. Our main result is Theorem [\ref=thm:main].

The main result

In this section we obtain our main result, which is Theorem [\ref=thm:main]. On our way to this result we obtain two other results Theorem [\ref=thm:A] and [\ref=thm:FK], which may be of independent interest. Throughout this section, let d denote a nonnegative integer and let p = ({θi}di = 0;{θ*i}di = 0) denote a sequence of scalars taken from [formula] that satisfies conditions (i), (ii) of Conjecture [\ref=conj:main].

Assume the field [formula] is infinite and let [formula] denote the [formula]-algebra from Definition [\ref=def:T]. Assume that, for every sequence {ζi}di = 0 of scalars taken from [formula] that satisfies condition (iii) of Conjecture [\ref=conj:main], there exists a sharp tridiagonal system over [formula] that has parameter array ({θi}di = 0;{θ*i}di = 0;{ζi}di = 0). Then the map [formula] from Lemma [\ref=lem:mu] is an isomorphism.

We assume d  ≥  1; otherwise the result is obvious. The map μ is surjective by Lemma [\ref=lem:mu], so it suffices to show that μ is injective. We pick any [formula] such that μ(f) = 0, and show f = 0. Instead of working directly with f, it will be convenient to work with the product ψ  =  fgh, where g  =  η*d(θ*0)xd and h is η*d(θ*0) times

[formula]

By construction [formula] so each of g,h is nonzero. To show that f = 0, we show ψ = 0 and invoke the fact that [formula] is a domain [\cite=Rot]. We now show that ψ = 0. Since the field [formula] is infinite it suffices to show that [formula] for all d-tuples [formula] of scalars taken from [formula] [\cite=Rot]. Let [formula] be given. Define

[formula]

and ζ0 = 1. Observe

[formula]

First assume {ζi}di = 0 does not satisfy condition (iii) of Conjecture [\ref=conj:main]. Then either ζd = 0, in which case [formula], or [formula], in which case [formula]. Either way [formula]. Next assume {ζi}di = 0 does satisfy condition (iii) of Conjecture [\ref=conj:main]. By the assumption of the present theorem, there exists a sharp tridiagonal system Φ = (A;{Ei}di = 0;A*;{E*i}di = 0) over [formula] that has parameter array ({θi}di = 0;{θ*i}di = 0;{ζi}di = 0). Let V denote the vector space underlying Φ. By Definition [\ref=def:split] the following holds on V:

[formula]

Consider the T-module structure on V from Lemma [\ref=lem:T-module]. Using [\eqref=eq:defzetai], [\eqref=eq:split2] we find that the following holds on V:

[formula]

Pick an integer i (1  ≤  i  ≤  d). By [\eqref=eq:aux5] the element e*0τi(a)e*0 acts on e*0V as ξi times the identity map. Recall that μ sends xi to e*0τi(a)e*0, so μ(xi) acts on e*0V as ξi times the identity map. By these comments μ(f) acts on e*0V as [formula] times the identity map. But μ(f) = 0 and e*0V  ≠  0 so [formula], and therefore [formula]. We have shown [formula] for all d-tuples [formula] of scalars taken from [formula], and therefore ψ = 0. The result follows.

Let [formula] denote a field extension of [formula]. Let the algebras [formula] and [formula] be as in Definition [\ref=def:T]. Let

[formula]

denote the maps from Lemma [\ref=lem:mu] and assume that [formula] is an isomorphism. Then [formula] is an isomorphism.

The map [formula] is surjective by Lemma [\ref=lem:mu], so it suffices to show that [formula] is injective. Since [formula] is a subfield of [formula] we may view any [formula]-algebra as a [formula]-algebra. The inclusion map [formula] induces an injective [formula]-algebra homomorphism [formula]. In the [formula]-algebra [formula] the defining generators a, {ei}di = 0, a*, {e*i}di = 0 satisfy the defining relations for [formula]. Therefore there exists a [formula]-algebra homomorphism [formula] that sends each of the [formula] generators a, {ei}di = 0, a*, {e*i}di = 0 to the corresponding generator in [formula]. The restriction of N to [formula] is a [formula]-algebra homomorphism [formula]; we denote this homomorphism by ν. By construction the following diagram commutes:

[formula]

The maps ι and [formula] are injective so their composition [formula] is injective. But [formula] so [formula] is injective. Therefore [formula] is injective and hence an isomorphism.

The following is our main result.

Let [formula] denote a field and let d denote a nonnegative integer. Let p = ({θi}di = 0; {θ*i}di = 0) denote a sequence of scalars taken from [formula] that is q-Racah in the sense of Definition [\ref=def:qRacah]. Let the [formula]-algebra [formula] be as in Definition [\ref=def:T]. Then the corresponding map [formula] from Lemma [\ref=lem:mu] is an isomorphism.

Abbreviate [formula] for the algebraic closure of [formula], and note that [formula] is infinite. Let [formula] denote the [formula]-algebra from Definition [\ref=def:T] and let [formula] be the corresponding map from Lemma [\ref=lem:mu]. By Proposition [\ref=prop:ITqRacah], for every sequence {ζi}di = 0 of scalars taken from [formula] that satisfies condition (iii) of Conjecture [\ref=conj:main], there exists a sharp tridiagonal system over [formula] that has parameter array ({θi}di = 0;{θ*i}di = 0;{ζi}di = 0). By this and Theorem [\ref=thm:A] the map [formula] is an isomorphism. Now μ is an isomorphism by Theorem [\ref=thm:FK].

We finish with a comment.

Proposition [\ref=prop:ITqRacah] remains true if we drop the assumption that [formula] is algebraically closed.

Immediate from Theorem [\ref=thm:main] and [\cite=NT:muconj].
