On prime chains

For integers a,b with a  ≥  1, a sequence of primes (pk)λ - 1k = 0 such that pk = apk - 1 + b for all 1  ≤  k  ≤  λ - 1 is called a prime chain of length λ based on the pair (a,b). This follows the terminology of Lehmer [\cite=Lehmer1965]. The value of pk is given by

[formula]

for all 0  ≤  k  ≤  λ - 1.

For prime chains based on the pair (2, + 1), Cunningham [\cite=Cunningham1907] listed three prime chains of length 6 and identified some congruences satisfied by the primes within prime chains of length at least 4. Prime chains based on the pair (2, + 1) are now called Cunningham chains of the first kind, which we will call C+ 1 chains, for short. Prime chains based on the pair (2, - 1) are called Cunningham chains of the second kind, which we will call C- 1 chains.

We begin with the following theorem which has ramifications on the maximum length of a prime chain; it is a simple corollary of Fermat's Little Theorem. A proof is also given by Löh [\cite=Loh1989]. Moser [\cite=Moser1952] once posed Theorem [\ref=THBasicStruct], with a,b,p0  ≥  1, as an exercise, for which he received fourteen supposedly correct proofs.

There are some choices of (p0,a,b) that are uninteresting. For example, if b =  - (a - 1)p0, then the prime chain is [formula]. In fact, if pi = pj for any distinct i,j then {pk}∞k = 0 will be periodic, with period dividing |pi - pj|. Also if gcd (a,b) > 1 then the sequence could only possibly be of length 1, since gcd (a,b) divides ap0 + b.

In this article we will therefore assume that (pk)∞k = 0 is a strictly increasing sequence. Theorem [\ref=THBasicStruct] implies that no choice of (p0,a,b) will give rise to a prime chain of infinite length. However, this raises the question, how long can a prime chain be? Green and Tao [\cite=GreenTao2008] proved that, for all λ  ≥  1, there exists a prime chain of length λ based on the pair (1,b) for some b. Lehmer [\cite=Lehmer1965] remarked that Dickson's Conjecture [\cite=Dickson1904], should it be true, would imply that there are infinitely many prime chains of length λ based on the pair (a,b), with the exception of some inappropriate pairs (a,b).

Discussions about searching for Cunningham chains were given by Lehmer [\cite=Lehmer1965], Guy [\cite=Guy2004], Loh [\cite=Loh1989] and Forbes [\cite=Forbes1999]. Tables of Cunningham chains are currently being maintained by Wikipedia [\cite=WikipediaCunningham] and Caldwell [\cite=Caldwell1999].

In this article, we will frequently deal with primes, denoted either p or q, that have a primitive root a. We therefore introduce the following terminology for brevity. If a is a primitive root modulo q then we will write [formula] and if q is prime and [formula], we will call q an [formula]-prime.

We begin with the following theorem, which slightly improves [\cite=Lehmer1965].

To begin, note that [formula] since [formula]. Suppose q does not divide p0(a - 1) + b. Let S = {pk}q - 2k = 1 and let Sq  =  {pk mod q}q - 2k = 1. If [formula] then

[formula]

by [\eqref=GeneralEq] and so

[formula]

since [formula]. Since q does not divide p0(a - 1) + b we find [formula] implying that [formula], since [formula]. Therefore |Sq|  =  q - 1.

If - b / (a - 1) mod q∈Sq then for some i,

[formula]

by [\eqref=GeneralEq], implying that [formula] contradicting our initial assumption. Hence [formula]. Since q does not divide b, we find that 0∈Sq and therefore q divides an element of S. But since S contains only primes, therefore q∈S.

To show that Theorem [\ref=Theorem1] is the "best possible" in at least one case, we identify the prime chain (7,11,23,59,167,491) of length λ = q - 1 = 6 based on (a,b) = (3, - 10). Here [formula] while [formula]. This raises the question, when can there exist a prime chain of length q - 1, for q, a and b satisfying the conditions of Theorem [\ref=Theorem1] while [formula]? In the next section, we will find that prime chains of this form, when [formula], are exceptional, which includes Cunningham chains of both kinds.

Cunningham [\cite=Cunningham1907] claimed that a C+ 1 chain (pk)λ - 1k = 0 of length λ  ≥  4 must have (a) each [formula] and (b) each [formula]. However, condition (b) is incorrect for the prime chain (2,5,11,23,47). In Theorem [\ref=THBpm1Mod8] we will prove that there are no counter-examples to Cunningham's condition (b) when p0 > 5. Lehmer [\cite=Lehmer1965] stated that C+ 1 chains (pi)λ - 1i = 0 of length λ  ≥  10 have [formula]. Loh [\cite=Loh1989] showed that C- 1 chains (pi)λ - 1i = 0 of length λ  ≥  12 have [formula]. In Corollary [\ref=COC1C2Chains] we will generalise this list of results to prime chains based on (2,b) for all odd integers [formula].

For any odd prime s let os(2) denote the multiplicative order of 2 modulo s. Let [formula]. We make use of the following Legendre symbol identities, which can be found in many elementary number theory texts, for example [\cite=LeVeque1996]. For odd prime q

[formula]

We are now ready to state and prove the main theorem.

Suppose p0 is an odd prime and is of the form p0 = 2m - b for some integer m. So pk = 2k + 1m - b for all 0  ≤  k  ≤  q - 2 by [\eqref=GeneralEq]. If q does not divide p0 + b, then Theorem [\ref=Theorem1] implies that q = pk = 2k + 1m - b for some 0  ≤  k  ≤  q - 2. If q = 2k + 1m - b where k  ≥  3, then

[formula]

by [\eqref=EQLegendre] since [formula]. However, this contradicts that [formula]. Hence q = p0 or q = p1.

We can now deduce the following corollary, for which we make use of the fact that contiguous subsequences of prime chains are themselves prime chains to find a large divisor for p0 - 1. Let [formula].

Let (pk)λ - 1k = 0 be a prime chain based on (2,b) for an odd integer [formula]. Let

[formula]

If p0  ≥  3, then pk + b is divisible by every q∈Q for all 0  ≤  k  ≤  λ - 1.

We know that 2 divides each pk + b since both pk and b are odd. So let [formula]. If [formula] then q divides pk + 1 for all 0  ≤  k  ≤  λ - 1 since [formula]. Observe that (pi)q - 2i = 0 is a prime chain of length q - 1 for all q∈Q. The result therefore follows from Theorem [\ref=THBpm1Mod8].

The [formula]-primes are given by Sloane's [\cite=Sloane] A001122 as 3,5,11,13,19,29,37,53, and so on. It would also be of interest to know if an analogue of Corollary [\ref=COC1C2Chains] holds for other non-trivial values of (a,b). The techniques in this article use the Legendre symbol identity [\eqref=EQLegendre] which requires a = 2 and [formula], so they are not easily extended to encompass other pairs (a,b).

Corollary [\ref=COC1C2Chains] does not hold for when p0 = 2. For example, (2,5,11,23,47) is a prime chain based on (2,1). In fact, the subsequences (2,5,11,23) and (5,11,23,47) also illustrate why we need to exclude p0 and p1 from Q in Corollary [\ref=COC1C2Chains].
