Models of the Intergalactic Gas in Stephan's Quintet

Introduction

Stephan's Quintet (hereafter SQ) is a compact group of galaxies discovered by Édouard Stephan in 1877. Since it is relatively close and shows many interesting features of galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-intergalactic medium (IGM) interactions SQ has been a popular object of study. Its multiple interactions, however, make difficult to know its dynamical history and interpret some observed aspects. In order to study SQ's dynamical evolution and the cause of the large-scale shock structure in its IGM seen in multiwavelength observations we have performed numerical simulations of SQ. In this proceedings we first review SQ's morphological and kinematical structures that we tried to simulate and then present our preliminary model results. Finally we discuss some adjustment of our current model to obtain better results.

Past Study of SQ

The optical morphology of SQ is shown in Figure 1. NGC 7320 is a foreground galaxy which has a considerably smaller redshift than others [\citep=BB1961]. Assuming a group distance of 94 Mpc and a Hubble constant of 70 km s- 1 Mpc- 2, the group except NGC 7318b has a redshift about 6600 km s- 1 and NGC 7318b is coming toward us with the relative velocity of about 900 km s- 1. Two long tidal tails extending from NGC 7319 toward NGC 7320c are visible. The southern tail, which is fainter, passes behind the foreground galaxy NGC 7320 and runs almost parallel with the northern tail. NGC 7319 is known to be a Seyfert 2 galaxy.

The VLA HI observations reveal that most of the HI gas resides outside of the galaxies [\citep=Williams2002]. The observed HI clouds along the two optical parallel tails are thought to be the result of one or more past encounters of NGC 7320c with the group [\citep=MSM1997] [\citep=Sulentic2001]. The past encounters might have stripped and removed most of the gas from NGC 7319 to the intergalactic space. NGC 7318b is colliding with the IGM which has formed during the past encounters [\citep=Sulentic2001] [\citep=Xu2003]. This ongoing collision may produce the large-scale shock in the IGM observed in radio continuum [\citep=AH1972] [\citep=vdHR1981], X-rays [\citep=Pietsch1997] [\citep=Trinchieri2003] [\citep=O'Sullivan2009] and mid-IR H2 emission [\citep=Appleton2006].

Numerical Simulations of SQ

Renaud and Appleton had performed N-body simulations of SQ using mostly NEMO, a stellar dynamics toolbox [\citep=Teuben1995]. Considering observational constraints they deduced probable ranges of initial conditions for their model galaxies and reproduced SQ's general morphology [\citep=RA2009]. In order to add thermohydrodynamical effects to the N-body model and study dynamical evolution of SQ we have produced an SPH code by modifying the SPH code of [\citet=Struck1997] which was designed for studying collisions between galaxy pairs (see [\citealp=Struck1997] for details). We performed the simulation with four strongly interacting members. Each of our model galaxies has disks with gas and collisionless star particles and a rigid dark matter halo. We took the initial parameters from the N-body model and adjusted them (mainly initial velocities of model galaxies) to use in the SPH model which has more extended dark matter halo potentials. We used total 81120 (40320 gas + 40800 star) particles and the mass ratio of 1(NGC 7319) : 0.7(NGC 7318a) : 0.6(NGC 7318b) : 0.2(NGC 7320c).

Our preliminary results of the SPH simulation are as follows. Figure 2.a and b show the production of two long tidal tails at an earlier time step. Since the effect of NGC 7318b to the group is small at early times we have put NGC 7318b into the simulation at this time step. Figure 2.c and d represent current morphology of SQ and the collision between NGC 7318b and the IGM from the model.

Discussion and Future Work

The general morphology of SQ was reproduced except the position of the southern tail and inner structures of spiral members. With our extended halo potentials the southern tail was placed too far out, so NGC 7318b did not hit many particles in the tidal tails. We will adjust it to make a more direct collision between the galaxy and the IGM. Also, to obtain well-matched results in radial velocities and temperatures of gas particles (not shown in this article) with those of HI, radio continuum, and X-ray observations, we will be working on �fine tuning� the initial parameters and cooling in the models.
