Operators on Asymptotic [formula] Spaces which are not Compact Perturbations of a Multiple of the Identity

Introduction

In this note, we give sufficient conditions on a Banach space whereby the space of bounded linear operators does does not solve the scalar-plus-compact problem of Lindenstrauss.

Lindenstrauss' question is related to the result of N. Aronszajn and K.T. Smith ([\cite=AS]) in 1954, which implies that if a space X satisfies the above condition and is a complex space, then every bounded linear operator on X must have a non-trivial invariant subspace. Thus, a complex space which is a positive solution to Lindenstrauss' problem also serves as a positive solution to the invariant subspace problem for Banach spaces.

That being said, the possibility that for any Banach space there is an operator on the space which is not a compact perturbation of a multiple of the identity, is still in play. In support of this possibility, sufficient conditions have been established on a space X which imply [formula] embeds isomorphically into L(X), the space of bounded linear operators on X (see [\cite=ABDS],[\cite=Fe],[\cite=K]). If a space X serves as a positive solution to the scalar plus compact problem, has a basis (or more generally the Approximation Property) and a separable dual space, then L(X) must be separable. Curiously, each of the results in support of a negative solution to the scalar plus compact problem, require the existence of an unconditional basic sequence in the space. The weaker problem of whether there is an operator which is not a compact perturbation of a multiple of the inclusion from a subspace of a Banach space to the whole space has also received attention (see [\cite=AOST],[\cite=ASa],[\cite=Go1],[\cite=S]).

In their successful effort to construct the first example of a space with no unconditional basic sequence, W.T. Gowers and B. Maurey ([\cite=GM1]) constructed a space which, as W.B. Johnson observed, possesses a stronger property called hereditarily indecomposable (HI). A Banach space is HI if no (closed) infinite dimensional subspace can be decomposed into a direct sum of two further infinite dimensional subspaces. This groundbreaking construction was a great leap forward in the progression towards a positive solution to the scalar-plus-compact problem. More precisely, it was shown that every operator on the space of Gowers-Maurey can be decomposed as a strictly singular perturbation of a multiple of the identity operator. Spaces which have this property are now aptly referred to as spaces admitting "few operators." An operator on a Banach space is called strictly singular if the restriction of it to any infinite dimensional subspace is not an isomorphism. The ideal of strictly singular operators on a space contains that of the compact operators, but in some cases (e.g. [formula], 1  ≤  p  <    ∞  ) they coincide. The fact that Gowers-Maurey space admits few operators is related to the fact that it is HI. In fact it was shown in [\cite=GM1], that every complex HI space admits few operators. In 1997, V. Ferenczi proved ([\cite=F1]) that a complex space X is HI if and only if every operator from a subspace of X into X is a multiple of the inclusion plus a strictly singular operator. It is not the case however, that admitting few operators implies that the space is HI. The most recent in a collection of counterexamples is the paper of S.A. Argyros and A. Manoussakis ([\cite=AM]) in which they construct a reflexive space admitting few operators for which every Schauder basic sequence has an unconditional subsequence. The most comprehensive resource for HI spaces and spaces admitting few operators is [\cite=AT].

The natural question then becomes: for any of these spaces which admit few operators does there exist a strictly singular non-compact operator, or do the strictly singular and compact ideals coincide? There have been results in this direction as well. In 2000, Argyros and Felouzis ([\cite=AF]) constructed an HI space X with the property that for every infinite dimensional subspace of X there is a strictly singular non-compact operator on X with range contained in the subspace. In 2001, G. Androulakis and Th. Schlumprecht ([\cite=AS]) constructed a strictly singular non-compact operator on the space of Gowers-Maurey. In 2002, I. Gasparis ([\cite=Ga1]) did the same for certain members of the class of totally incomparable asymptotic [formula] HI spaces constructed in [\cite=Ga2]. In 2006, G. Androulakis and the author ([\cite=AB]) and A. Manoussakis and I. Deliyanni ([\cite=DM]) independently constructed different asymptotic [formula] HI spaces (for p = 2 in the former case and for all 1  <  p  <    ∞   in the latter). In the following, by extending results in [\cite=Ga1], sufficient conditions are established under which a strictly singular non-compact operators can be found on each of these spaces.

Additional Note: Recently, S.A. Argyros and R. Haydon have constructed a L∞ HI space on with every operator is a multiple of the identity plus a compact operator.

Definitions and Notation

Our notation is standard and can be found in [\cite=LT]. Let (ei)∞i = 1 denote the unit vector basis of [formula], and (e*i)∞i = 1 the biorthogonal functionals of (ei)i. Let span  {(ei)i} denote vectors finitely supported on (ei)i. For a Banach space X let [formula] and [formula]. If [formula] then E < F if max E  <   min F. If [formula] for scalars (ai)i, let [formula] and the range of x, denoted r(x), be the smallest interval containing supp  (x).

The notion of Schreier families ([\cite=AA]) is used throughout. They are defined inductively as follows. Let [formula]. After defining Sn let,

[formula]

A few properties of the Schreier families we need are:

(Hereditary) For [formula], Sn  ⊂  Sn + 1.

(Spreading) If (pi)Ni = 1∈Sn and pi  ≤  qi for all i  ≤  N, then (qi)Ni = 1∈Sn.

(Convolution) If (Fi)Ni = 1 is a collection of subsets of [formula] such that Fi∈Sn for all i  ≤  N, [formula] and ( min Fi)Ni = 1∈Sm for some [formula] then [formula].

Let (Ei)ki = 1 be a sequence of successive subsets of [formula], we say that (Ei)ki = 1 is Sn admissible if ( min Ei)ki = 1∈Sn. For [formula] and (aj)j∈c00 the sequence (xi)ki = 1 defined by [formula] is called a block sequence of (ej)j. For a block sequence (xi)ki = 1 of (ej)j we say that (xi)ki = i is Sn admissible if (supp  xi)ki = 1 is Sn admissible.

Herein we define a class of spaces in terms of the norming functionals of the space. We begin by recalling the notion of a norming set ([\cite=Ga1]),

A set N  ⊂  span  {(e*i)i} is called norming if the following conditions hold,

(e*n)n  ⊂  N,

If x*∈N then |x*(en)|  ≤  1 for all [formula].

If x*∈N then - x*∈N (N is symmetric).

If x*∈N and E is an interval in [formula] then Ex*∈N (where Ex* denotes the restriction of x* to the coordinates in E).

If N is a norming set we can define a norm [formula] on c00 by

[formula]

for every (ai)∈c00. Now define the Banach space XN to be the completion of c00 under the above norm. By the definition of norming set, (ei)i is a normalized bimonotone basis for XN.

For the following definitions and notation we closely follow [\cite=Ga1]. The following are conditions on two increasing increasing sequences of positive integers, (ni)∞i = 1 and (mi)∞i = 1.

m1  >  3, there is an increasing sequence of positive integers (si)∞i = 1 such that [formula], m2j + 1 = m52i for i  ≥  1 and m51 = m2.

For the sequence of integers, (fi)∞i = 2 defined by,

[formula]

require that 4fj  <  n2j for all j  ≥  2 and 5n1  <  n2.

We now define a particular type of norming set. Our definition is slightly less general than that which would be considered analogous to (M,N)-Schreier in [\cite=Ga1]. Our goal is to tailor the definition of (M,N,q)-Schreier so as to make it as apparent as possible that the spaces found in [\cite=AB] and [\cite=DM] are (M,N,q)-Schreier for specified q.

For sequences M = (mi)∞i = 1 and N = (ni)∞i = 1 satisfying (i) and (ii) we call a norming set N, (M,N,q)-Schreier (for 1 / q + 1 / p = 1 and 1  <  p,q  <    ∞  ) if for the following sets, with [formula],

[formula]

we have [formula] and Nj  ⊂  N for all j.

In the case of the Banach space constructed in [\cite=AB], there are fixed sequences M = (mi)∞i = 1 and N = (ni)∞i = 1. We suppose further that M and N satisfy conditions (i), (ii). It follows directly from the definition that the norming set for this space is (M,N,2)-Schreier.

For the asymptotic [formula] HI space, X(p), found in [\cite=DM] the reasoning is similar. Assume that the sequences M and N prescribed in [\cite=DM] satisfy conditions (i), (ii). For a fixed p and 1 / q + 1 / p = 1 we must show that the norming set N (denoted K in [\cite=DM]) is (M,N,q)-Schreier. The reader should refer to [\cite=DM] for the precise definitions of K,Kn and Knj. [formula] where [formula]. By definition, for [formula], Kn2j  ⊂  Nj, and Kn2j + 1  ⊂  Nq∞ (for the latter inclusion the factor 21 / p in the definition of Nq∞ is required). Thus, [formula]. If x*∈Nj then [formula] where (x*i)i  ⊂  N  =  K, so again by the definition of K, we see that Nj  ⊂  N.

It is convenient to view an element of N as successive blocks of the basis (e*i)i. This decomposition into blocks is not unique, and thus our goal is to find a decomposition that is the most suitable. To this end, we associate each element of N with a rooted tree. A finite set with a partial ordering [formula] is called a tree if for every α∈T the set [formula] is linearly ordered. Each element of the tree T is called a node. A node α∈T such that there is no β with [formula] is called terminal ([formula] means [formula] and [formula]). If [formula] we say α is a successor of β. For α∈T let Dα(T) denote the set of immediate successors of α in T. A branch of T is a maximal linearly ordered subset.

For each α∈T we define corresponding [formula], mα∈(mi)∞i = 1 and nα∈(ni)∞i = 1. We associate to each x*∈N a rooted tree T (i.e. a tree with a unique first node) in the following way: Let α0 be the root of T. There is an x*α0∈N such that x*  =  γα0x*α0 and

[formula]

In this definition (x*β)β∈Dα0(T) is Snα0 admissible, mα0  =  mj for some [formula] and [formula] if j is even and [formula] if j is odd. Thus for any pairwise incomparable collection A of T which intersects every branch of T we have,

[formula]

Call (x*α)α∈T the functional tree of x*. For β∈T the functional x*β has a corresponding tree Tβ, which is a subset of T.

Main Results

We start this section by stating the main theorem of the paper. The proof of this theorem can be found at the end of this section. The majority of this section is devoted to proving auxiliary lemmas and remarks.

Let N be a norming set which is (M,N,q)-Schreier and [formula] be the corresponding Banach space. There is an operator on [formula] which is not a compact perturbation of a multiple of the identity. If [formula] is HI, this operator is strictly singular. Moreover, [formula] embeds isomorphically into [formula].

The existence of the following sequence in the space [formula] is the main ingredient in the construction of the desired operator. The definition below is tailored to fit our construction.

Let (xk)k be a block basic sequence of (ek)k. If there is a C > 0 such that for all [formula], [formula] with F  ≥  l and (xk)k∈F being Sfl admissible we have [formula] for every scalar sequence (βk)k∈F, we say (xk)k satisfies an upper [formula] estimate with constant C.

For the rest of the section we fix p, q and N such that 1 / p  +  1 / q = 1 and N is a (M,N,q)-Schreier norming set. It follows easily that any normalized block sequence (xi)mi = 1 with m  ≤  supp  x1 in [formula], satisfies a lower [formula] estimate with constant 1 / m2. The next remark demonstrates that [formula] is an asymptotic [formula] space by verifying that is satisfies an upper [formula] estimate on normalized blocks.

Let [formula] be a normalized block basic sequence of (ei)i. For any sequence of scalars (ai)i the following holds:

[formula]

For x*∈N, let o(x*) denote the height (i.e. the length of the longest branch) of the tree T associated with x*. We proceed by induction on o(x*). We will show that for all x*∈N such that o(x*) = n, [formula] holds for any normalized block basic sequence (xi)mi = 1 of (ei)i and any sequence of scalars (ai)i. For x*∈N such that o(T) = 1 the assertion follows easily. Assume the claim for all y*∈N such that o(y*) < n and let [formula] with o(x*) = n. By definition of N, (x*j)j is Snk admissible and [formula]. Define the following two sets,

[formula]

and [formula]. Apply the functional x* to [formula] to obtain:

The first inequality follows from the triangle inequality. The second follows from applying the induction hypothesis for [formula] and using the definition of Q(2). We may apply the induction hypothesis since the height of the trees associated with the functionals x*j are each less than n. Before continuing, notice that for each i∈Q(2) the set [formula] is an interval and therefore,

[formula]

The above estimate continues as follows,

In the first inequality we used the fact that 3 < m1 in the first term and ([\ref=inNC]) in the second term. For the second inequality we applied Hölders inequality. For the third inequality we used the fact that for each j there are at most two values of i∈Q(2) such that [formula]. For the final inequality we used [formula]. This finishes the proof.

The following is a compilation of remarks (variants of which can be found in [\cite=Ga1]) regarding the sequences (mi)∞i = 1,(ni)∞i = 1 and (fi)∞i = 2. In the interest of completeness we have included the proofs.

If [formula] for k  ≥  2, then pk  ≤  2fk.

If (ai)k - 1i = 1 is a sequence of non-negative integers and [formula] such that [formula] then [formula].

Let [formula] be a sequence of non-negative integers, (x*i)ti = 1∈N be [formula] admissible and [formula] then we have,

[formula]

The proof of (1.1) follows by induction. For k = 2 we have f2 = 4n1 + (s1 - 1)n2. Since s1  ≥  2 the claim follows. Suppose the statement is true for some k  ≥  2. Let [formula] and observe that,

We obtained the third inequality by noting that [formula] and using the maximality of fk + 1.

To prove (1.2), again proceed by induction. For k = 2, deduce from the hypothesis that a + 5a1  <  5s1. Clearly, a1  <  s1. If a < 5 we are done. Suppose 5n  ≤  a  <  5(n + 1) for some [formula]. This implies that a1  <  s1 - n. The following inequality finishes the proof of the base step,

[formula]

The final inequality follows from 5n1  <  n2.

Assume the statement is true for some k  ≥  2. By assumption, [formula] and by definition m2k + 2  =  msk + 12k. Clearly, [formula]. Thus sk + 1  ≥  ak. This leaves two possibilities, either sk  =  ak or sk  >  ak. In the former case, [formula]. By the induction hypothesis [formula] and thus [formula]. If sk  >  ak we claim that [formula], which clearly finishes the proof. To see this, we start by showing that [formula]. By assumption [formula], which implies that,

[formula]

where ⌊x⌋ is the greatest integer of x. By the maximality of fk we have,

[formula]

Since x  ≤  2⌊x⌋ for x  ≥  0 we see that,

[formula]

Finally, using 4fk  <  n2k observe that,

[formula]

The proof of (1.3) requires a complicated induction. For simplicity we prove the case where aj = al = 1 for some j,l  ≤  k. Suppose (x*i)ti = 1∈N is Sn2l + n2j admissible. Let [formula]. We wish to show that,

[formula]

Do this by carefully grouping the functionals. Let (Jk)mk = 1 be successive intervals of integers such that [formula], (x*i)i∈Jk is Sn2l admissible for each k  ≤  m and (x*min Jk)mk = 1 is Sn2j admissible. Now define a sequence (z*k)mk = 1 by,

It is straightforward to check that z*k∈Nl for all k  ≤  m. The claim follows by observing that (z*k)mk = 1 is Sn2j admissible since (x*min Jk)pk = 1 is Sn2j admissible and [formula].

Before proceeding further, we pause briefly to discuss the structure of the proof of Theorem [\ref=mainthm]. The proof begins by introducing some auxiliary remarks and lemmas. Remark [\ref=decomprem] and Lemma [\ref=dl] follow from the technical definitions of the sequences (ni)i and (mi)i and the tree structure of the functionals in N. Lemma [\ref=dl] is quite specific to spaces which are (M,N,p) Schreier and will be used throughout the proof of Theorem [\ref=mainthm]. The main task at hand is to construct a sequence of functionals in N which are seminormalized and satisfy an upper [formula] estimate with constant 1. We do this in Lemma [\ref=mainlemma]. The construction of these functionals is rather straightforward; it is in proving that they possess the desired properties that we must make use of Lemma [\ref=dl] and Corollary [\ref=admissiblecor]. Once we have constructed these norming functionals (and after making a few easy remarks) we are ready to define the operator. This is done in a very natural way. The fact that the operator is bounded and non-compact follows from the the properties of the norming functionals from which it is built.

For any functional tree T we define a function [formula] in the following way,

[formula]

Let (x*α)α∈T be a functional tree for some x*∈N such that for α∈T, (x*β)β∈Dα(T) is Sφ(T) admissible. For every subset A of T consisting of pairwise incomparable nodes, the collection (x*α)α∈A is Sd admissible where [formula].

We proceed by induction on o(T). The base step is trivial. Let k  ≥  1 assume the statement for T such that o(T)  <  k + 1 and suppose o(T) = k + 1. Let α0 be the root of T and for α∈Dα0(T) let Tα be the tree corresponding to x*α. For the given collection A and α∈Dα0(T) we can define [formula]. Notice that [formula] or A = {α0}. Apply the induction hypothesis for each collection Aα to conclude that (x*β)β∈Aα is Sdα admissible for [formula]. Let dα0  =   max α∈Dα0(T)dα. The block sequence ((x*β)β∈Aα)α∈Dα0(T) is Sdα0  +  φ(α0) admissible by the convolution property of Schreier families. Finish by observing that [formula] and ((x*β)β∈Aα)α∈Dα0(T)  =  (x*α)α∈A.

Our next lemma allows us to decompose norming functionals. Decompositions are extremely useful when attempting to find tight upper estimates on the norm of vectors in the space.

(Decomposition Lemma) Let [formula] and x*∈N such that supp  x*  ≥  2k. There is an [formula], [formula], a partition I1,I2 of [formula] and scalars (λi)mi = 1 such that,

[formula]

x*i  =    ±  e*ji for i∈I1 and {ji:i∈I1}∈Spk - 1.

[formula] and [formula]

Let x*∈N and [formula]. Let T be the tree corresponding to x*. For each node β there are corresponding mβ, nβ and γβ. Let B denote the set of branches of T. For each branch b∈B let α(b) denote the node of b such that either α(b) is the first node β for which [formula] holds, or the terminal node of b if no such β exists. Set A = {α(b):b∈B}. Notice that A is a collection of pairwise incomparable nodes intersecting every branch of B. Let A1 denote the set of terminal nodes of A and [formula]. Enumerate A with the set [formula] for some [formula] and define It  =  {i:x*i∈(x*α)α∈At} for t∈{1,2}. By ([\ref=decomp]) we have,

[formula]

It is left to verify that conditions (b) and (c) hold. Condition (c) follows from the fact that for each α, [formula], and observing that,

[formula]

The second part of (c) follows similarly. The first part of (b) follows from the definition. For the second part of (b) we employ Remark [\ref=decomprem]. Let [formula]. For α∈R such that mα = m2j + 1 for some [formula], (x*β)β∈Dα(R) is S1 and hence Sn1 admissible. To see this, first note that for all β∈R, mβ < m2k. By the injectivity of the function σ, (defined in Nq∞) for β,γ∈Dα(R), [formula]. Since supp  x*  ≥  2k we have that (x*β)β∈Dα(R) is S1 admissible. Thus for α∈A1, (x*β)β∈Dα(R) is Sφ(α) admissible. By Remark [\ref=decomprem], (x*α)α∈A1 is Sd admissible where [formula].

Let α∈A1. We have [formula], where [formula]. Apply (1.2) for b1  =  "a" and b2i + 5b2i + 1  =  "ai", to conclude that,

[formula]

We also have,

[formula]

This holds for all α∈A1 and thus, [formula].

Let x*∈N and [formula]. Decompose x* as,

[formula]

Then the set,

[formula]

is Spk - 1 admissible.

For [formula] we can assume without loss of generality that supp  x*  ≥  2k. Apply the decomposition lemma to x* to obtain I1 and I2 such that

[formula]

where {ji:i∈I1}∈Spk - 1. We claim that,

[formula]

If this were not the case, then for some i0∈I2,

[formula]

From the proof of the decomposition lemma,

[formula]

For β∈A2 we have that [formula]. Serving as our contradiction.

Before passing to the main lemma of the paper we state the following fact concerning the existence of a particular sequence of scalars. These scalars are called repeated hierarchy averages and were first studied in by Argyros, Mercourakis and Tsarpalias in [\cite=AMT]. These averages are defined in [\cite=AB] for q = 2. In [\cite=Ga1] a similar fact is established for q = 1.

For any 1  ≤  q <   ∞   and ε > 0, there exist successive subsets of [formula], (Fk)∞k = 1, and scalars (ak,i)i∈Fk, such that for each [formula], Fk  ≥  2k, Fk∈Spk, [formula] and [formula] for G∈Spk - 1.

The next lemma establishes the existence of a seminormalized block sequence satisfying an upper [formula] estimate with constant 1 in [formula]. These blocks are constructed using Fact [\ref=fact] and used to construct the desired operator on [formula].

Let (Fk)∞k = 1 be successive subsets of [formula] and scalars (ak,i)i∈Fk be such that Fk  ≥  2k, Fk∈Spk, [formula] and [formula] for all G∈Spk - 1 and each [formula]. The sequence of functionals (x*k)∞k = 1∈N defined by, [formula], are seminormalized and satisfy an upper [formula]-estimate with constant 1.

We start by making an observation concerning the decomposition of each x*k. For fixed k, and k0  ≤  k write [formula] such that [formula], each Jk,r is Spk - pk0 admissible and (Jk,r)dkr = 1 is Spk0 admissible (we can do this because Fk is Spk admissible). Then,

[formula]

Since [formula] and (e*i)i∈Jk,r is Spk - pk0 admissible, we conclude by (1.3) that z*k,r∈N for all r  ≤  dk. Since, min Jk,r  =   min supp  z*k,r, we have that (z*k,r)dkr = 1 is Spk0 admissible.

We now show that (x*k)k satisfies and upper [formula] estimate with constant 1. For starters, let [formula] and [formula] with F  ≥  k0 such that (x*k)k∈F is Sfk0 admissible. For every k∈F we apply the above (since F  ≥  k0) to define (z*k,r)dkr = 1. The block sequence ((z*k,r)dkr = 1)k∈F is Spk0 + fk0 admissible, by the convolution property of Schreier families. Hence it is Sn2k0 admissible by (1.1) and the hereditary property of Schreier families. To conclude, it suffices to let [formula] and show that [formula]. We do this by observing the following equality,

Since [formula] and ((z*k,r)dkr = 1)k∈F is Sn2k0 admissible, it follows that [formula]. Thus, (x*k)k satisfies a upper [formula]-estimate with constant 1.

To show that (x*k)k is seminormalized, it suffices to find a uniform lower bound. For each k, define [formula]. It suffices to show that [formula]. From this it follows easily that [formula] for all [formula]. Let x*∈N be an arbitrary norming functional which we may assume without loss of generality satisfies supp  x*  ≥  2k (since Fk  ≥  2k). By applying the decomposition lemma for [formula] and x*, we can estimate [formula] from above as follows,

The first inequality follows from the decomposition lemma and the triangle inequality. The second inequality follows from the triangle inequality, the definition of xk, and Remark [\ref=ulp]. The third follows from two applications of Hölders inequality. For the last inequality we used condition (c) of the decomposition lemma, the fact that (ji)i∈I1 is Spk - 1 admissible (by condition (b) of the decomposition lemma) and the definition of (ak,i)i∈Fk. This concludes the proof.

We make two final remarks before proceeding with the proof of the main theorem.

Let (y*i)i be the even subsequence of the seminormalized block sequence (x*i)i satisfying an upper [formula] estimate with constant 1 defined in Lemma [\ref=mainlemma]. Let [formula], [formula], with F  ≥  k such that (y*i)i∈F is Sn2k admissible. Then [formula] for all [formula].

Let [formula], F be a subset of [formula], with F  ≥  k and (y*i)i∈F being Sn2k admissible. Set G = {i:i = 2j,  ~  j∈F} and note that (yi)i∈F  =  (x*i)i∈G. Since F  ≥  k we have, i  ≥  k + 1 for all i∈G. Since (x*i)i satisfies an upper [formula], estimate G  ≥  k + 1 and (x*i)i∈G is Sn2k admissible an thus Sfk + 1 admissible, we have,

[formula]

This concludes the proof.

Let (y*i)i be the subsequence from Remark [\ref=sub]. For every x∈S(X), [formula], [formula] with F  ≥  k and (y*i)i∈F being Sn2k admissible we have [formula].

Let x∈S(X), [formula] and [formula] with F  ≥  k such that (y*i)i∈F is Sn2k admissible. By Remark [\ref=sub] for all [formula] we have [formula]. Apply this for,

[formula]

and estimate [formula] from below with x.

( Proof of Theorem [\ref=mainthm]) We are now ready to define the desired operator on [formula]. Let (y*i)i be the seminormalized block sequence from Remark [\ref=sub]. For x∈c00 define the operator T:c00  →  c00 by [formula]. Once we show that T is a bounded operator it can be extended as on operator defined on [formula].

Since (y*i)i is a seminormalized block sequence it follows that T is non-compact. In the case that [formula] is an HI space, T must be strictly singular. Since dim(Ker  T) =   ∞  , if there was an infinite dimensional subspace Y of XN such that T|Y was an isomorphism. Y + Ker  (T) would be a direct sum. Contradicting the fact that [formula] is HI. (It is known that the spaces constructed in [\cite=DM] have few operators. Using similar techniques it can be further shown that the space constructed in [\cite=AB] has few operators.)

Our final task is to demonstrate that T is bounded. Let x∈S(X) and x*∈N. If x*  =    ±  e*j for some j then |x*(Tx)|  ≤  1. Thus assume x*∈N such that |supp  x*| > 1. Suppose x* has the following decomposition,

[formula]

Define,

[formula]

For k  >  2 define,

[formula]

For k  >  2 define, Gk  =  {jβ∈Hk:jβ  ≥  2k}. Clearly, [formula]. Apply Corollary [\ref=admissiblecor] to deduce that Gk∈Spk - 1. By (1.1) and (ii), Gk∈Sn2k. By the spreading property of Schreier families (yi)i∈Gk is Sn2k admissible for all k. For each k, apply Remark [\ref=firstrem] to deduce that,

[formula]

Estimate |x*(Tx)| from above in the following way,

The first inequality follows from the triangle inequality and the definitions of Hk,Gk. For the second, we apply Hölders inequality to each of the terms. For the first and second terms of the third inequality we used ([\ref=last]) and the definition of Hk. For the third term of the third inequality we used the fact that |x*(ei)|  ≤  1 for all i, [formula] and the definition of Hk. For the final inequality we used the fact that [formula] for A = Hk,Gk or [formula]. Thus, [formula].

We conclude by noting that [formula] embeds isomorphically into [formula] via the mapping

[formula]

Here "SOT -  lim " denotes the strong operator topology limit. To see that this is a bounded isomorphism one merely follows, almost identically, the previous calculation.
