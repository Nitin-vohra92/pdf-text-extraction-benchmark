Explanation of the Meissner Effect and Prediction of a Spin Meissner Effect in Low and High Tc Superconductors

When a metal is cooled into the superconducting state in the presence of an external magnetic field, a surface current spontaneously arises that generates a magnetic field in direction opposite to the external one, thus canceling the magnetic field in the interior of the superconductor (Meissner effect)[\cite=meissner]. The conventional BCS theory of superconductivity[\cite=bcs] describes the final state of this process, i.e. the superconducting state with magnetic field excluded. However it does not explain how the Meissner current is generated, nor how the mechanical angular momentum carried by the Meissner current is compensated.

The equation of motion for an electron of charge e and mass me in the presence of electric and magnetic fields is

[formula]

Using

[formula]

and Faraday's law [formula] it follows that

[formula]

for the 'generalized vorticity'

[formula]

Note that [formula] is essentially the curl of the canonical momentum [formula], with [formula] the magnetic vector potential. In the normal state, at time t = 0:

[formula]

independent of position [formula]. We set [formula] because in the normal state there is no net macroscopic charge flow. Hence the canonical momentum [formula] is nonzero throughout the interior of the superconductor in the initial state.

In the superconducting state, the superfluid velocity [formula] obeys the London equation[\cite=bcs]

[formula]

Together with Ampere's law, Eq. (6) implies that the Meissner current flows within a London penetration depth

[formula]

of the surface, with ns the superfluid carrier density. Therefore, according to Eqs. (4) and (6)

[formula]

everywhere in the superconducting body. Equivalently, the canonical momentum [formula] throughout the interior of the (simply connected) superconductor. BCS theory predicts that the state of lowest energy for the superconductor in the presence of a magnetic field (that is lower than the critical field) has [formula], or equivalently [formula]. However, neither London theory nor BCS theory address the question of how [formula] changes from its initial value [formula] to its final value [formula].

In a cylindrical geometry, assuming azimuthal symmetry as well as translational symmetry along the cylinder axis (z) direction (infinitely long cylinder)

[formula]

and Eq. (3) takes the form

[formula]

with r the radius in cylindrical coordinates. Eq. (10) implies that w can only change if there is radial flow of charge (vr  ≠  0). Moreover, for w to evolve towards its final value 0 requires vr > 0, i.e. a radial outflow of electrons. BCS theory does not predict a radial outflow of electrons in the transition to superconductivity, hence within Eq. (10) it predicts that w does not change with time. Consequently, BCS theory claims that in the transition to superconductivity the conduction electrons ignore the fundamental equation of motion Eq. (1) and somehow magically evolve [formula] from its initial non-zero value throughout the interior of the superconductor to zero everywhere. Perhaps through discrete jumps in an undetectable fractal hyperspace? We argue that this is unphysical and impossible. Instead, the theory of hole superconductivity predicts expulsion of negative charge from the interior of the superconductor[\cite=expulsion], hence vr  ≠  0, hence provides an explanation for how [formula] is driven to zero.

Eq. (10) can be written as

[formula]

which has the form of a continuity equation. It implies that the only way that w can change in a region enclosed by a surface is by flowing out through the surface, carried by the fluid flow moving with velocity [formula]. We conclude that in order for [formula] to evolve from [formula] to zero, superfluid electrons have to flow out from the cylinder through its surface, thereby carrying [formula] outside the superconductor. This outflow of electrons when the metal is cooled below Tc and expels a magnetic field from its interior should be observable through optical or X-ray diffraction techniques with grazing incidence on a clean metal surface.

If there is a radial outflow of electrons when a system goes superconducting, the final state will not have a homogeneous charge distribution, hence there will be an electric field in the interior of the superconductor. The conventional London equations cannot describe such situation because the 'first London equation' [formula] implies that the superfluid current [formula] diverges in the presence of an electric field. Instead, the modified London equations proposed by the author[\cite=electrodynamics] and by London[\cite=londonold] allow for the presence of a static electric field in the interior of superconductors. These equations are derived in a manner similar to the conventional derivation of the London equations except that the Lorentz rather than the London gauge is assumed to be valid in the second London equation [formula], resulting in the constitutive relation[\cite=electrodynamics]

[formula]

relating the electric potential φ to the charge density ρ. The parameter ρ0 > 0 is an integration constant giving the uniform positive charge density in the interior of the superconductor resulting from the expulsion of negative charge, and [formula] is the corresponding potential. For a cylindrical geometry, the electrostatic field in the interior far from the surface is given by[\cite=electrospin] [formula], with

[formula]

and R the radius of the cylinder.

The expulsion of negative charge from the interior of the superconductor gives rise to a macroscopic spin current flowing within a London penetration depth of the surface of the superconductor[\cite=sm], with carrier velocity given by

[formula]

with [formula] the carrier's spin and [formula] the unit vector in direction normal to the surface. The associated kinetic energy satisfies

[formula]

which is analogous to the equation relating the superfluid charge velocity to the magnetic energy density[\cite=bcs].

In the presence of an external magnetic field [formula] the carrier velocity is [formula], and the magnetic field that stops one of the components of the spin current (sets vσ = 0) has magnitude

[formula]

and is similar to Hc1, the lower critical field in the conventional theory[\cite=bcs]. The external magnetic field induces a non-zero spin density near the surface[\cite=electrospin] ([formula] is the direction of [formula])

[formula]

which will give rise to a non-zero Knight shift at zero temperature.

The driving force for charge expulsion is kinetic energy lowering associated with expansion of the electronic orbits from radius k- 1F to radius 2λL[\cite=sm]. This is the origin of the 'electromotive force' that overcomes the Faraday counter-emf arising when the magnetic field is expelled, as well as the electrostatic potential energy rise created by the charge expulsion. This radial 'quantum force' (or 'quantum pressure') associated with expansion of the de Broglie wavelength is very different from an ad-hoc azimuthal 'quantum force' postulated by Nikulov in an attempt to explain the Little-Parks experiment and the Meissner effect[\cite=nikulov]. How the angular momentum in the Meissner current is compensated is discussed in Ref. [\cite=sm].

Metals will have strongest tendency to expel negative charge when their conduction band has many electrons (is almost full, i.e. holes) and when the conducting substructures (eg planes) have excess negative charge, as occurs in the cuprates, arsenides and MgB2. Those are the ideal conditions for high temperature superconductivity, but the essential physics is proposed to be the same for all superconductors, whether Tc is high or low.
