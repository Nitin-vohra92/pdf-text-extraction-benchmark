To treat this problem it is convenient to use the basis of neutrino mass eigenstates in free space, ν1, ν2 and ν3. In this basis we have three different reactions e + 142Pm →   ν1 + 142Nd, e + 142Pm →   ν2 + 142Nd and e + 142Pm →   ν3 + 142Nd (the amplitudes of these reactions are proportional to the expansion coefficients Ue1, Ue2 and Ue3 correspondingly where νe = Ue1ν1 + Ue2ν2 + Ue3ν3). The final states of these reactions are different and orthogonal to each other since ν1, ν2 and ν3 are different particles. Therefore, the amplitudes of these reactions can not interfere, and no oscillations are possible. The situation here is similar, for example, to decays like π →   μν and π →   eν, where we have different particles in the final states of two reactions and no oscillations in the π-meson decay.

Why neutrino oscillations appear in other reactions? Weak interaction used to detect the neutrino projects ν1, ν2 and ν3 to the state νe (if electron is produced). As a result, we have three amplitudes (with intermediate states ν1, ν2 and ν3) which lead to the same state νe. Here we have interference and oscillations. In the case of the GSI experiment this does not happen.

One may speculate about a different possibility to produce the interference. Neutrinos pass through the strong electromagnetic field. If neutrinos have magnetic moments which are not diagonal in the ν1, ν2, ν3 basis (for example, if the magnetic moments are diagonal in the νe, νμ and ντ basis) one, in principle, may have three amplitudes leading to the same final state and neutrino oscillations. However, it is hard to link this possibility to the GSI oscillations.

In Ref. [\cite=Lambiase] the GSI oscillations were explained by oscillations between the ionic states with different total angular momentum [formula] which is due to the rotation of the electron spin [formula] and the nuclear spin [formula] in the magnetic field B of the storage ring in the GSI experiment. For example, the 142Pm nucleus has spin I = 1, and we have two values of F possible, F = 3 / 2 and F = 1 / 2. If probability of the weak electron capture depends on F, the oscillations between the states F = 3 / 2 and F = 1 / 2 would lead to the oscillations in the electron capture rate. In principle, such an effect may exist, however, the authors of [\cite=Lambiase] overestimated it by many orders of magnitude; also, the frequency of such oscillations would be ~  1014 Hz instead of ~  10- 1 Hz. Indeed,the authors of Ref. [\cite=Lambiase] neglected the hyperfine interaction between the electron spin and nuclear spin. However, in heavy hydrogen-like ions the hyperfine interaction is enhanced by a factor Z3  ~  105 times, where Z is the proton number. This interaction exceeds the interaction of the electron and nuclear spins with the magnetic field by many orders of magnitude and determines the interval between the hyperfine levels EHf. Mixing of the hyperfine states F = 3 / 2 and F = 1 / 2 is proportional to μBB / EHf and very small (here μB is the Bohr magneton). Moreover, this mixing will not lead to the oscillations if the switching of the field in the ion reference frame is slow (adiabatic) in comparison with the hyperfine period h / EHf  ~  10- 14 s. Finally, the oscillations, if any, will be determined by the energy difference between the hyperfine states and have a frequency EHf / h  ~  1014 Hz.

The motion of the ion (on the circular orbit in the ring) does not change the value of F, it only changes the evolution of the direction of [formula] which, however, does not influence the electron capture rate.

Note that any link between the GSI oscillations and atomic phenomena would not look natural. Indeed, the energy intervals and interactions in the ion including the interactions with external fields in the storage ring in the GSI experiment exceed 0.1 Hz by many orders of magnitude. Such phenomena like Rabi oscillations with a noticeable modulation amplitude would require a special experimental arrangement and do not happen by chance.
