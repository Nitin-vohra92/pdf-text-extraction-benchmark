On the Hurwitz Zeta Function

Introduction

The Hurwitz zeta function defined by the series

[formula]

where 0 < a  ≤  1, is a well-defined series when [formula], and can be analytically continued to the whole complex plane with one singularity, a simple pole with residue 1 at s = 1.

The Hurwitz zeta function has also the following integral representation

[formula]

valid for [formula] [\cite=whittaker]. Moreover, it has the following analytic continuation represented by the following contour integral

[formula]

where C is the Hankel contour consisting of the three parts [formula]: a path which extends from ( -   ∞  , - ε), around the origin counter clockwise on a circle of center the origin and of radius ε and back to ( - ε, -   ∞  ), where ε is an arbitrarily small positive number.

The integral ([\ref=sec1-eq3]) defines ζ(s,a) for all [formula] with a single pole at s = 1.

New Integral and Series representations of ζ(s,a)

The new representations of ζ(s,a) are based on the alternating sums defined by

[formula]

and by S1(s,a) = 1 for n = 1, and on the real function ψ(t) defined by

[formula]

We prove the following theorem

For all s such that [formula] and all [formula], we have

[formula]

We can rewrite Sn(s,a) in ([\ref=sec2-eq1]) as

[formula]

since we know that

[formula]

a valid formula for [formula], and since

[formula]

The proof consists of an evaluation of the sum

[formula]

But before we do so, we need to establish the following two identities valid for 0 < t <   ∞  :

[formula]

To prove these identities, we start from the series

[formula]

which is valid for 0 < t <   ∞  .

This yields

[formula]

and

[formula]

from which the two identities follow easily.

Without worrying about interchanging sums and integrals for the moment, we have

[formula]

and similarly

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

This proves that the right hand sides of (A) and (B) in the statement of the theorem are equal. Now, by observing that

[formula]

we can perform an integration by parts in ([\ref=sec2-eq16]) when [formula]. The integral in the right hand side of ([\ref=sec2-eq16]) becomes

[formula]

Thus,

[formula]

and this prove the theorem when [formula]. However, formula ([\ref=sec2-eq19]) remains valid for [formula] since the integral ([\ref=sec2-eq16]) is well-defined for [formula].

To finish the proof, we now need to justify the interchange of summation and integration in both equation ([\ref=sec2-eq11]) and equation ([\ref=sec2-eq14]). We show this justification for equation ([\ref=sec2-eq11]) only, the other is similar.

The interchange in ([\ref=sec2-eq11]) is indeed valid because the series

[formula]

converges absolutely and uniformly for 0 < t <   ∞  . To prove this, it suffices to show uniform convergence for the dominating series

[formula]

where [formula].

Indeed, let K =  max((1 - e- t)n - 1e- t / 2), 0 < t <   ∞  . A straightforward calculation of the derivative shows that

[formula]

and is attained when [formula]. Now, for n  ≥  2, we have

[formula]

The last inequality implies that each term of the dominating series is bounded by [formula]. Thus the dominating series converges by the comparison test. This completes the proof of the theorem.

With C being the Hankel contour defined previously, an immediate corollary of Theorem [\ref=sec2-thm1] is the following

For [formula] and for all [formula], we have

[formula]

The proof the first statement follows the same steps as in [\cite=whittaker] for example. As for the second statement, we can either proceed as in [\cite=hasse] or as in [\cite=lazhar]. In [\cite=lazhar], the proof was given for ζ(s) (i.e. a = 1) and uses an estimate of the exact asymptotic order of growth of Sn(s,1) when n is large. By looking at the definition of Sn(s,a), we can see that Sn(s,1) are the Stirling numbers of the second kind modulo a multiplicative factor when [formula]. Therefore, when s =  - k, k a positive integer, Sn( - k,1) are eventually zero for n large enough. Similarly, Sn(s,a) are the generalized Stirling numbers of the second kind whose generating function is given by [\cite=carlitz]:

[formula]

It follows that

[formula]

and hence Sn( - k,a) are eventually zero for n large enough.

For [formula], an asymptotic estimate of Sn(s,a) can be obtained for n large. Indeed, we have by definition

[formula]

By making the change of variable, k = m - 1, the sum can obviously be put into the form

[formula]

Asymptotic expansions of sums of the form ([\ref=sec2-eq25]) have been thoroughly studied in [\cite=flajolet]. The function [formula] has a non-integral algebraic singularity at s0 = 1 - a since 0 < a < 1; thus, when s is nonintegral, Sn(s,a) has the following asymptotics when n is large

[formula]

and when [formula] the following expansion

[formula]

For the case a = 1 and s nonintegral, the numerator becomes equal to 1 and we obtain

[formula]

The asymptotic estimates ([\ref=sec2-eq26]), ([\ref=sec2-eq26bis]) and ([\ref=sec2-eq27]) are valid for n large enough and for all s such that [formula]. To finish the proof of the corollary, we note that the logarithmic test of series implies that our series is dominated by a uniformly convergent series for all finite s such that [formula]. Now, by Weierstrass theorem of the uniqueness of analytic continuation, the function (s - 1)ζ(s,a) can be extended outside of the domain [formula] and that it does not have any singularity when [formula]. Moreover, by repeating the same process for [formula], [formula], it is clear that the series defines an analytic continuation of ζ(s) valid for all [formula].

We can also obtain the analytic continuation of ζ(s,a) to the whole complex plane via the following

For all s such that [formula] and all [formula], we have

[formula]

For all k and all [formula], the integrand is bounded and has finite values at the limits of integration. Repeated integration by parts proves the corollary.

Now if we consider the function ζ(s,a) - a- s dealt with in [\cite=berndt], we obtain the following corollary

Let [formula]. Then, for all s such that [formula] and all [formula], we have

[formula]

The proof follows the same lines as the proof of Theorem [\ref=sec2-thm1].

We note that when a = 0, ζ(s,a) - a- s  =  ζ(s). The formulas of Corollary [\ref=sec2-coro3] reduce to the formulas found in [\cite=lazhar].

A formula for the Laurent coefficients

Berndt [\cite=berndt] (see also the references therein) derived expressions for the coefficients of the Laurent expansion of the Hurwitz zeta-function ζ(s,a) about s = 1. He also provided a method to calculate and estimate these coefficients. In this section, we give exact estimates of the coefficients of (s - 1)ζ(s,a)Γ(s) for any point of the complex plane, and from these coefficients the Laurent coefficients of ζ(s,a) about the same point can be easily calculated.

We will only consider expansions around a point s0 = x + iy in the right half plane, i.e. x > 0. For the other points, the reader will realize that the extension can be easily accomplished.

The idea is to simply use the integral formula given in formula (A) of Theorem [\ref=sec2-thm1]. From this formula, the analytic function (s - 1)ζ(s)Γ(s) can be represented by a Taylor series around any point s0

[formula]

where the coefficients a0 = (s0 - 1)ζ(s0,a)Γ(s0) and an are given by

[formula]

with ψ(t) being given in equation ([\ref=sec2-eq1bis]).

Thus, following [\cite=berndt], if we set

[formula]

and if we expand Γ(s) around the point s0 into a Taylor series of the form

[formula]

where c0  =  Γ(s0) and

[formula]

we easily obtain

[formula]

To get the last formula, we have merely used the coefficient formula of division of power series. The formula is recursive and can be used to calculate γn(a,s0) for any 0 < a  ≤  1 and any s0 in the right half plane. If s0 is not in the right half plane, the integral formula ([\ref=sec2-eq28]) of Corollary [\ref=sec2-coro2] can be used instead.
