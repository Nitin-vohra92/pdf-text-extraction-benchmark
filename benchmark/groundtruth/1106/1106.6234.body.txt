Micro-structure of damage in thermally activated fracture of Lennard-Jones systems

Introduction

Understanding sub-critical fracture occurring under constant or periodic external loads below the fracture strength of materials is a very important scientific problem with a broad spectrum of technological applications. Depending on materials' details several microscopic mechanisms may contribute to the time dependent response and final failure of samples. In spite of this diversity, experiments and theoretical investigations have revealed that sub-critical fracture obeys scaling relations both on the macro and micro scales [\cite=alava1] [\cite=alava2].

Thermal activation of micro-crack nucleation and growth is one of the primary mechanisms underlying sub-critical fracture. Theoretical and experimental investigations have shown that both in homogeneous and heterogeneous materials thermally driven stress fluctuations can be responsible for the finite lifetime of loaded specimens [\cite=science_280_265_1998_gelfracture] [\cite=ciliberto_1] leading to the emergence of universal scaling laws such as the Andrade law and time-to-failure power laws [\cite=sornette_andrade_law] [\cite=nechad_sornette_prl_2005], furthermore, to the scaling behavior of waiting times between micro-fractures [\cite=ciliberto_2] [\cite=cortet:205502] [\cite=ciliberto_4] [\cite=ciliberto_5] [\cite=ciliberto_6]. Experiments have also revealed that thermally activated slow crack advancements affect even the surface roughness of growing cracks [\cite=mallick:255502].

In order to understand the mechanisms of the sub-critical fracture of crystalline and glassy materials at the atomistic scale, molecular dynamics simulations [\cite=allen] performed at finite temperatures proved to be indispensable [\cite=thermo2] [\cite=lj_fracture_2] [\cite=lj_fracture_3] [\cite=lj_fracture_4] [\cite=lj_fracture_1] [\cite=thermo1]. Computer simulations of Lennard-Jones particle systems made possible to understand the origin of the Griffith-type crack nucleation at the atomic scale showing the importance of the creation of vacancy clusters and voids [\cite=lj_fracture_2] [\cite=lj_fracture_3] [\cite=lj_fracture_4] [\cite=lj_fracture_1] [\cite=thermo1] [\cite=yip_1] [\cite=pugno] [\cite=mattoni_prl_2005]. The simulation technique was also extended to study dynamic fracture phenomena [\cite=marder_ijf_2004].

In the present paper we study thermally activated sub-critical fracture using molecular dynamics simulations of a Lennard-Jones particle system in two dimensions. A rectangular sample with a triangular lattice structure is constructed which is then subject to a constant external load at different notch length varying also the temperature. We show that the critical stress of the system has an inverse square root dependence on the notch length as expected from linear fracture mechanics (LFM) corrected by the extension of the fracture process zone. The stress intensity factor at a given notch length decreases with increasing temperature due to the more efficient relaxation of overloads in the vicinity of the crack. In order to characterize the micro-structure of the loaded sample, we introduce the six-fold order parameter and analyze its spatial distribution during the secondary creep regime. Computer simulations revealed that damage concentrates ahead of the crack tip and decays to a nearly homogeneous background at larger distances. The damage profile has an exponential form from which the characteristic scale of damage can be determined. Increasing the temperature the damage profile broadens and the background damage increases which are consistent with the decreasing stress intensity factor. The results are discussed in comparison to the micro-structure of heterogeneous solids with only quenched disorder under quasi-static loading just before ultimate failure [\cite=zapperi1].

Model

We perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of two dimensional solids which consists of particles. The particles interact through the Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential

[formula]

where r,ε and a are the distance between particles, the strength of the potential and the characteristic length of the particle, respectively. For the computational efficiency, we cut the interaction potential Eq. ([\ref=eq:ljpot]) at the distance 3a when calculating the inter-particle force, i.e. if the distance r between two particles exceeds 3a, the interaction disappears. The parameters ε, a and the mass of particles m are set to be unity in all the simulations. The temperature T is defined as the average kinetic energy of the system [formula], where [formula] denotes the velocity of i-th particle, N is the number of particles, and [formula] is the Boltzmann's constant. Hereafter we also set the Boltzmann's constant [formula] to be unity.

A schematic picture of the computational geometry is presented in Fig. [\ref=fig:setup]. In order to control the temperature, Nose-Hoover thermostats are attached to two particle layers on the top and bottom of the system [\cite=nh1] [\cite=nh2]. In the horizontal direction we apply periodic boundary condition to make the crack advance from the initial crack in the middle of the system and to prevent the vaporization of particles due to the thermal effect.

The initial state of the sample is prepared as follows: The particles are placed on a regular triangular lattice at zero temperature T = 0 then the temperature of the system is slowly increased up to the desired value. We take the width of the system as the corresponding equilibrium value for the temperature. Simulations were carried out with a fixed value of the width l0≃100 of the lattice. As a crucial component of the model, an initial crack is created by removing four particle layers with length 2L in the middle of the system. In this way the crack has a nearly rectangular shape with extensions 2L  ×  3.5a. Note that the distance 3.5a of the two sides is larger than the cutoff length 3a of the potential, which ensures that the removed particles form a crack in the model. In order to prevent the crack from healing due to thermal fluctuation, the particles on the upper and bottom crack faces interact through the repulsive part of the LJ potential Eq. ([\ref=eq:ljpot]). After equilibrating the system, the load is applied in such a way that the bottom and top particle layers are attached to loading bars through spring elements. The bottom bar is fixed while the upper one can move vertically controlling the load σ on the system. The bars are treated as rigid bodies with a mass 10- 3 per unit length, while the loading springs have zero mass and a spring constant 10. The stiffness of the solid is about 83 for the parameters used in the simulations, which is significantly larger than the one of springs.

In order to suppress the disturbing effect of elastic waves generated by the external loading process, the loading bar moves from the initial position until the desired stress value σ is reached at a relatively low increasing rate dσ / dt = 10- 2. Simulations showed that the value of the loading rate slower than dσ / dt = 10- 2 did not affect the time evolution of the system.

Time evolution

The time evolution of the solid subject to a constant load is calculated numerically by the second-order symplectic integrator method with the time step dt = 10- 3, while the time evolution of the thermostat and the bar is obtained using the Euler method. Figure [\ref=fig:time] presents snapshots of the time evolution of the system at the temperature T = 0.1, the load σ = 1.45, the initial crack length 2L  =  20 and the width of the system l0≃100. Starting from the initial state (Fig. [\ref=fig:time](a)) we gradually increase the external load σ up to the desired value and equilibrate the system to achieve the desired temperature. Figure [\ref=fig:time](b) shows the sample after the ramp loading, i.e., when the stress becomes constant for the rest of the simulation. It is observed in Fig. [\ref=fig:time](c) that the crystalline structure of the lattice gets distorted. Nucleation of defects and voids due to thermal fluctuations is also observed, which facilitates the advancement of the crack. When the specimen is separated into two parts by a crack like in Fig. [\ref=fig:time](d), the system is considered to be fractured.

On the macroscopic level, the time evolution of the system can be monitored by measuring the vertical size l(t) of the sample in the direction of the external load as a function of time t. This quantity is presented in Fig. [\ref=fig:def] for several temperatures with the initial crack length 2L = 20. Note that the sample of Fig. [\ref=fig:time] corresponds to the curve of T = 0.1 in Fig. [\ref=fig:def]. The plateau regime of the deformation is the consequence of the slow dynamics of the system, where the lattice structure gets gradually distorted while the length of the crack hardly changes. The final macroscopic failure occurs rapidly, which is characterized by the sudden acceleration of the vertical size l(t) and by its diverging derivative in Fig. [\ref=fig:def]. The acceleration of the vertical size is preceded by the creation of defects and voids due to thermal activation. Small oscillations are observed along the plateau of l(t), which are caused by elastic waves generated by the loading process and the void creations due to the thermal noise.

Macroscopic strength

The main difficulty of the investigation of thermally activated fracture of LJ systems is the enormous computational time required due to the slow dynamics of the system. To overcome this problem, we introduce a threshold time of the simulation; After the stress σ reaches the desired value, we limit the simulation time to the finite threshold time tth. This threshold gives a lower limit of the lifetime of the sample; If no complete failure is achieved by following the time evolution of the system up to tth, the lifetime of the sample is assumed to be infinite at the given external load σ. The highest load at which no macroscopic failure occurs before tth defines the critical load σc of the system which separates the regimes of finite and infinite lifetimes. The critical load σc of the system is determined by a sequence of simulations performed with a constant load increment 0.05, which provides sufficient accuracy for σc. In this paper, the threshold time is fixed to be tth = 103.

In order to investigate the effect of the notch size 2L and of the temperature on the macroscopic strength σc, we carry out simulations with the following parameters: 2L = 0,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40, and 2L = 45 for the temperatures T = 0,0.06,0.1,0.14, and T = 0.2. We do not show the data of 2L = 0,5 at T = 0 because the crack did not grow at the crack tip. The value of σc is determined by averaging over 10 samples at each parameter set.

Based on linear fracture mechanics we expect the inverse square root dependence of the critical load σc on the notch size L as it has been proved by an analytical calculation [\cite=bazant_1]. In order to capture the disordering effect of temperature, we introduce a characteristic length ξ which modifies the notch size into an effective one L  +  ξ. Then we write σc in the following form

[formula]

where K denotes the stress intensity factor [\cite=zapperi1] [\cite=bazant_1] and c is a finite size correction of the system width. The finite size correction c is a negative value and its system size dependence is plotted in the inset of Fig. [\ref=fig:ld]. It is important to emphasize that the value of the correction factor c goes to zero with increasing system size l0. To numerically demonstrate the validity of the functional form Eq. ([\ref=eq:xifpz]), in Fig. [\ref=fig:ld] we plot [formula], where σ'c(L) = σc(L) - c, as a function of half of the notch length L. It is observed in Fig. [\ref=fig:ld] that straight lines are obtained with a good accuracy at all temperatures by fitting. Deviations from the linear form are observed for both large and small values of the initial crack length: In the large crack length regime [formula], deviations occur due to the finite size of the system, on the other hand, in the limit of small cracks [formula], the stress concentration at the crack tip becomes less dominating so that the fracture process is mainly controlled by thermal noise emerging in the entire volume of the system. By fitting these data from L = 2.5 to 20, we estimate the stress intensity factor K and the characteristic length ξ of Eq. ([\ref=eq:xifpz]) for each temperature.

Figs. [\ref=fig:stin](a) and (b) present the temperature dependence of the stress intensity factor K and of ξ, respectively. It is observed that the stress intensity factor K decreases with increasing temperature T, while the value of ξ is an increasing function of T. In Fig. [\ref=fig:stin](a), at higher temperature thermally activated particle motion has a higher intensity which facilitates the relaxation of the system and gives rise to a decreasing K. In Fig. [\ref=fig:stin](b) the results imply that at higher temperature a broader zone is formed ahead of the crack tip where distortion of the crystalline structure and plastic deformation can occur due to the interplay between the stress field and the thermal noise. The length scale ξ can be interpreted as the linear extension of the fracture process zone (FPZ) ahead of the crack tip which appears due to the disordering effect of thermal noise on the lattice structure. In the vicinity of the crack tip the high stress concentration makes the system more sensitive to thermal fluctuations. As a consequence, a distorted zone emerges which affects the scaling of σc with the notch size L. Similar effect is observed in heterogeneous quasi-brittle materials where damage in the form of micro-cracks is concentrated ahead of the crack [\cite=zapperi1] [\cite=bazant_1].

Micro-structure of damage

In order to obtain a direct quantitative measure of the extension of the process zone formed ahead of the crack tip, we carry out a detailed analysis of the micro-structure of the system before the acceleration of deformation starts. To characterize the crystalline order, we introduce the bond-orientational order parameter φk defined for particle k as follows [\cite=order_param]

[formula]

Here nk denotes the number of neighbors of particle k and θkl is an angle between a fixed axis such as the x axis and the bond connecting particle k to particle l. The value of φk can vary between zero and one such that φk = 1 quantifies a perfectly ordered triangular lattice, while φk  ≈  0 is obtained for a disordered fluid-like system. Intermediate values of the order parameter characterize the degree of distortion of the lattice structure.

In order to characterize the spatial variation of the micro-structure, we calculate a locally averaged bond-orientational order parameter φ on a coarse-grained mesh in the sample. The mesh size is taken to be 2  ×  2. The order parameter is evaluated for a single sample, but 30 snapshots are taken from the plateau regime of the deformation-time diagrams in order to improve the statistics. As shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:def], the two vertical arrows indicate the time window of the plateau regime for the case of temperature T = 0.2. A typical example of the order parameter φ for the temperature T = 0.06 is presented in Fig. [\ref=fig:order]. It is observed that the crystalline structure has strong distortion in the vicinity of the crack tip where the stress concentration is high. Away from the crack tip, and even near the middle of the crack, the order parameter is homogeneously distributed and it has a large value close to unity, i.e. the crystalline structure is retained there.

To obtain a detailed quantitative measure of the disordering effect of the stress concentration assisted by the thermal noise, we introduce a damage parameter with the following definition

[formula]

which has a large value dk  ≈  1 at locations where the lattice structure is most distorted. Based on the above meshing technique, we average dk on each plaquette of the mesh, then make a projection on the horizontal axis, and determine the damage parameter along the initial crack axis as a function of the distance from the crack tip x; At each position x, the averaged damage parameter is averaged again on the vertical column of 5 plaquettes. The damage profile d(x) obtained by this way is presented in Fig. [\ref=fig:dam] for several different temperatures. Note that the calculations are performed at the same load value σ = 1.0 for all the temperatures at the given notch length 2L = 20. It is observed that d(x) monotonically decreases with increasing distance x from the crack tip as it is expected, and converges to finite values at long distances. The figure presents that the profiles can be well described by the exponential form

[formula]

where the parameter A represents the uniform background damage, ξFPZ is the characteristic length of the extension of the distorted zone, and the multiplication factor B represents the maximum value of the additional damage above the background achieved at the crack tip. The functional form Eq. ([\ref=eq:exponential]) provides an excellent fit of the numerical data in all cases. Therefore we determine the temperature dependence of the parameters A, B, and ξFPZ (see Fig. [\ref=fig:dampar] and Fig. [\ref=fig:stin](b)). Note that the damage parameter d at zero temperature decreases to zero at large distances, while it takes non-zero value at the crack tip. This clearly indicates that the distortion of the lattice is caused by the high stress concentration arising in the vicinity of the crack tip. Increasing the temperature, the thermal noise gets stronger which lightens the stress concentration near the crack tip by distorting the lattice structure. This mechanism has the consequence that with increasing temperature the localization of stress at the crack tip decreases which is quantified by the increasing characteristic length ξFPZ (see Fig. [\ref=fig:stin](b) and Fig. [\ref=fig:dampar]).

The most important characteristics of the micro-structure is represented by the length scale ξFPZ which provides a measure of the extension of the highly distorted zone. It can be observed in Fig. [\ref=fig:stin](b) that ξFPZ increases when the temperature gets higher. It shows that increasing thermal noise in the system gives rise to a larger extension of the fracture process zone. It can also be observed in Fig. [\ref=fig:stin](b) that ξ and ξFPZ have a linear relation which implies that the micro-structure based length ξFPZ provides a good measure of the macroscopic fracture process zone.

Conclusions and Discussion

We carried out a detailed study of the creep rupture of Lennard-Jones particle systems by means of molecular dynamics simulations. In order to control the temperature a Nose-Hoover thermostat was coupled to the sample which was then subject to a constant load through spring elements. The main focus of our work was to understand the effect of thermal fluctuations on the creep strength and to investigate the micro-structure of the evolving system before the onset of rapid crack growth leading eventually to macroscopic failure. Simulations showed that the critical stress of samples has an inverse square root dependence on the notch length corrected by the extension of the fracture process zone. The fracture process zone arises due to the distortion of the lattice structure as a consequence of the interplay of the high stress concentration at the crack tip and of the thermal noise. The final failure occurs rapidly after the creation of vacancies and voids in the process zone.

In order to obtain a direct quantitative measure of the extension of the fracture process zone, we introduced a damage parameter and analyzed its spatial distribution. Our calculations revealed that damage concentrates in the vicinity of the crack tip and decays exponentially to a homogeneous background damage level. In spite of the inverse square root form of the stress distribution ahead of the crack expected from linear fracture mechanics, the damage profile is described by an exponential form which let us introduce a characteristic length scale of damage ξFPZ. The highly distorted regime of extension ξFPZ is analogous to the fracture process zone observed in various types of systems.

A similar exponential form of the damage profile was recently found for heterogeneous materials where thermal activation does not play a role [\cite=zapperi1]. The authors investigated quasi-brittle fracture processes in the framework of the fuse model gradually increasing the load on notched samples up to failure. Evaluating the density of micro-cracks in the critical state of the sample just before macroscopic failure, it was found that damage concentrates ahead of the crack. The damage profile proved to have an exponential form similar to our one. It was argued that micro-cracks concentrate at the crack tip due to the high stress concentration, however, as a counter effect they screen the stress field which then leads to the exponential decay instead of the inverse square root form [\cite=zapperi1].

A very interesting question addressed by Ref. [\cite=zapperi1] is the crossover between the two regimes where the fracture strength of the system is dominated by stress concentration at the notch and by the disorder, respectively. The deviation from the linear behavior in Fig. [\ref=fig:ld] at the limit of small notch sizes already indicates the dominance of thermal noise in the fracture process. However, due to technical reasons we could not further decrease the initial crack length which prevents us to deduce quantitative conclusion on the crossover phenomenon.
