All Fierz-Paulian massive gravity theories have ghosts or superluminal modes

FP theories

By Fieirz-Paulian massive gravity theories (FP) we mean all nonlinear completions of the original Fierz and Pauli (1939) linearized massive gravity. FP can be represented by 4 non-canonical scalars interacting with Einsteinian gravity ( Chamseddine and Mukhanov 2010, Dubovsky 2004, Arkani-Hamed et al 2003). The action of the FP theory is

[formula]

Here L is an arbitrary symmetric function of the eigenvalues of the matrix

[formula]

where gμν is the metric tensor, [formula] - 1, - 1) is the Minkowski matrix, and φA, A = 0,1,2,3, are the 4 scalar fields.

De Rham et al (2010) show that all FP theories have the Boulware and Deser (1972) ghost, unless the theory belongs to a special 2-parameter family of FP theories - call it FP2. In FP2 the 4-field Lagrangian is (Nieuwenhuizen 2011)

[formula]

where the sums are over all all-distinct pairs and triples of indices, λA are the four eigenvalues of the matrix

[formula]

and c1, c2 are the two dimensionless parameters of the theory.

It is not known whether the FP2 family is ghost-free, but we show here that it does not matter, because the scalar sector of FP2 has superluminal modes in flat spacetime.

Superluminal modes in FP2

Let (t,x,y,z) be Minkowski coordinates in flat spacetime. Since our Lagrangian depends only on the derivatives of the fields, any 4 linear functions of coordinates solve the equations of motion, and can be chosen as background. For our purposes, full generality is not needed. It is sufficient to consider the following background fields:

[formula]

We will ultimately take small ε, because we are interested in the backgrounds close to φA  =  (t,x,y,z) - a zero-stress-energy background of FP with gμν  =  ημν. But at this point of the calculation, ε is just an arbitrary constant.

Consider infinitesimal (linear) perturbation of the form

[formula]

To second order in χ, that is for linear waves, the Lagrangian is (Appendix)

[formula]

To leading order in ε,

giving the phase speed [formula], which is superluminal unless [formula]. It remains to consider the case [formula]. For [formula], to third order in ε, [formula], which is superluminal.

Appendix

With gμν  =  ημν, and the scalar fields given by ([\ref=bg], [\ref=pt]), the matrix HAB  =  ηBCgμν∂μφA∂νφC is

[formula]

We need to calculate the eigenvalues λA of the matrix [formula]. We first calculate κA - the eigenvalues of H. From

we get

From ([\ref=k3]), λ3 = 0, and the Lagrangian simplifies to

Here λA = 1 - κ1 / 2A, giving

From ([\ref=kp], [\ref=ks], [\ref=kp2]) we have

To zero order in χ, ([\ref=s]) gives

Then we define

To second order in χ, ([\ref=s]) gives

[formula]

[formula]

This system gives s1 and s2. We use the resulting expressions in ([\ref=la]) and get ([\ref=lat]).
