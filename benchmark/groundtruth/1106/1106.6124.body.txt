Introduction

Let us consider the following second order ODE:

[formula]

General point transformations

[formula]

preserve the form of equation ([\ref=eq]).

Let us consider two arbitrary equations ([\ref=eq]). The problem of existence of the point transformation ([\ref=zam]) that connects these equations is called the Equivalence Problem. For the arbitrary equations ([\ref=eq]) the explicit solution of the equivalence problem is rather complicated, see [\cite=Tresse1], [\cite=Tresse2]. It was effectively solved for the linear equations, see [\cite=Liouville], [\cite=Grissom], [\cite=Ibragimov], [\cite=Yumaguzhin], [\cite=Sharipov2], [\cite=Babich]; for some Painleve equations, see [\cite=Lamb], [\cite=Sokolov], [\cite=Babich],[\cite=Hietarinta], [\cite=Dridi], [\cite=Kartak]; for the Emden equation, see [\cite=BordagBandle] and for other equations, for example, see [\cite=Sharipov2], [\cite=Meleshko].

The main approach that allows to solve the equivalence problem is based on the Invariant Theory. Invariant is a certain function depending on (x,  y) that is unchanged under the transformation ([\ref=zam]): I(x,y) = I((x,y),(x,y)).

Pseudoinvariant of weight m is a certain function depending on (x,  y) that is transformed under ([\ref=zam]) with factor det T (the Jacobi determinant) in the degree m:

[formula]

Pseudotensorial field of weight m and valence (r,s) is an indexed set that transforms under change of variables ([\ref=zam]) by the rule

[formula]

here S = T- 1. It is easy to check that only factor ( det T)m distinguishes the pseudotensorial field from the classical tensorial field.

Invariant Theory of equation ([\ref=eq]) goes back to the classical works of R.Liouville [\cite=Liouville], S.Lie [\cite=Lie], A.Tresse [\cite=Tresse1], [\cite=Tresse2], E.Cartan [\cite=Cartan], [\cite=Thomsen] (Late 19th- and Early 20th-Century) and continues in the works of [\cite=Grissom], [\cite=Lamb], [\cite=Hietarinta], [\cite=BordagDruima], [\cite=Babich], [\cite=Sharipov1], [\cite=Sharipov2], [\cite=Sharipov3], [\cite=Ibragimov] (Late 20th-Century). It remains an active research topic in the 21th-Century, see [\cite=BordagBandle], [\cite=Kartak], [\cite=Meleshko]. Background is adequately described in papers [\cite=Babich], [\cite=BordagBandle].

In the present paper we use notations from works [\cite=Sharipov1], [\cite=Sharipov2], [\cite=Sharipov3], [\cite=Kartak] to calculate the invariants and pseudoinvariants of equations ([\ref=eq]). The correlation between these (pseudo)invariants and semiinvariants from works [\cite=Cartan], [\cite=Liouville] (as they were presented in [\cite=BordagBandle]) shows in the next chapter. The explicit formulas for their computation via known functions P(x,y), Q(x,y), R(x,y), S(x,y) contained in the Appendix A. Here and everywhere below notation Ki.j denotes the partial differentiation: Ki.j  =  ∂i  +  jK  /  ∂xi∂yj.

Computation of invariants

Some geometric objects

Step 1. From the functions P, Q, R and S, that are the coefficients of equation ([\ref=eq]), let us organize the 3-indexes massive by the following rule:

[formula]

As the 'Gramian matrixes' let us take the following couple:

[formula]

Step 2. Let us reise the first index

[formula]

Under the change of variables ([\ref=zam]) Θkij transforms "almost" as a affine connection. (The transformation rule is into the paper [\cite=Sharipov1]).

Step 3. Using Θkij as the affine connection let us construct the "curvature tensor":

[formula]

and the "Ricci tensor" [formula] The both objcts are not the tensors. (See [\cite=Sharipov1]).

Step 4. The following 3 indexes massive is the tensor:

[formula]

Here we use Θkij instead of the affine connection when made the covariant differentiation.

Step 5. Using the tensor Wijk let us construct the new pseudovectorial fields:

[formula]

The coincident pseudovectorial fields are: αj = djkαk of weight 2, βj = djiβi of weight 4.

There are only 3 situations:

Pseudovectorial field α=0, maximal degeneration case, equation is equivalent to y'' = 0;

Fields α and β are collinear: 3F5  =  αiβi = 0, intermediate degeneration case;

Fields α and β are non-collinear: 3F5  =  αiβi  ≠  0, general case.

At the present paper we consider the intermediate degeneration case: F = 0 but α≠  0.

Step 6. Let us denote the quantities φ1 and φ2 (their explicit formulas the are into Appendix A) and organize the affine connection Γkij and the pseudoinvariant Ω of weight 1

[formula]

The rule of covariant differentiation of the pseudotensorial field was presented in [\cite=Sharipov1]:

[formula]

If the pseudotensorial field F has type (r,s) and weight m, then the pseudotensorial field [formula] has type (r,s + 1) and weight m.

Step 7. Pseudovectorial fields α and β are collinear, hence exists the coefficient N, it is the pseudoinvariant of weight 2, such that: β = 3Nα. Then

[formula]

Here ξ - pseudovectorial field of weight 3; M - pseudoinvariant of weight 4; γ - pseudovectorial field of weight 3; Γ - pseudoinvariant of weight 4. (See paper [\cite=Sharipov1]).

Invariants

In this paper we are interest the case M  ≠  0, that named the first case of intermediate degeneration. By definition it means that also N  ≠  0 and γ  ≠  0. The basic invariants are

[formula]

By differentiating invariants I1, I2, I3 along pseudovectorial fields α and γ we get invariants

[formula]

Repeating this procedure more and more times, we can form an infinite sequence of invariants, adding six ones in each step.

So, to calculate the invariants we have to compute:

pseudovectorial field α = (B,   - A)T of weight 2, see formula ([\ref=alpha]);

pseudovectorial field γ of weight 3, see formulas ([\ref=gamma1]), ([\ref=gamma2]);

pseudoinvariant F of weight 1, see formula ([\ref=F]);

pseudoinvariant M of weight 4, see formulas ([\ref=M1]), ([\ref=M2]);

pseudoinvariant N of weight 2, see formula ([\ref=N]);

pseudoinvariant Ω of weight 1, see formulas ([\ref=Omega1]), ([\ref=Omega2]);

pseudoinvariant Γ of weight 4, see formula ([\ref=Gamma]).

Correlation between the semiinvariants

No doubt the main part of the pseudoinvariants have been known previously.

At the work E.Cartan [\cite=Cartan] have adopted the following notations:

[formula]

At the work R.Liouville [\cite=Liouville] were presented the semiinvariants ν5, w1, i2 and the quantity R1 (see rewiew in [\cite=BordagBandle]). Here is a link between these quantities and pseudoinvariants F, Ω, N and quantity H:

[formula]

Pseudovectorial field γ, pseudoinvariant M and pseudoinvariant Γ first appeared in the papers [\cite=Sharipov1], [\cite=Sharipov2], [\cite=Sharipov3]. At the present paper we use the new notation in order to be able to compute the chais of invariants ([\ref=inv2]).

The main problem

The main problem is to describe the equivalence classes of equations ([\ref=eq]) from the first case of intermediate degeneration with the conditions I1 = const  ≠  0 and I2 = 0 under the general point transformation ([\ref=zam]). So, we investigate equations ([\ref=eq]) such that

[formula]

It is easy to see that two sequences of the invariants ([\ref=inv2]) become trivial ones: [formula] and [formula].

According to papers [\cite=Babich], [\cite=BordagBandle], each equation ([\ref=eq]) that satisfies the relations F = 0 and I2 = 0 can be transformed into the form

[formula]

For equations ([\ref=model]) holds the following relations:

[formula]

Let us calculate the invariant I1:

[formula]

Four Types of equations

Every equation ([\ref=eq]) with conditions ([\ref=cond]) can be transformed by point transformations ([\ref=zam]) into the form:

[formula]

where

[formula]

Proof. Let us resolve the differential equation ([\ref=A]) with respect to the function A(x,y). There are two possibilities:

[formula]

where a(x) and b(x) are arbitrary functions.

According to paper [\cite=BordagBandle], the most general point transformations preserving the form ([\ref=model]) is the following transformation:

[formula]

Here α, β - constants, p(), h() - certain functions.

Therefore the direct and inverse transformations matrices S and T are

[formula]

After the transformations ([\ref=form]) the pseudovectorial field α of weight 2 changes as

[formula]

So the transformation rules for A and B are: Ã(,) = α2p5()A(x(),y(,)),  = 0.

Let C1 = 1 and function A from ([\ref=C1]), then

[formula]

Choosing the appropriate functions h() and p() we can get

[formula]

Let C1  ≠  1 and function A from ([\ref=C1]), then

[formula]

Choosing the appropriate functions h() and p() we can get a(x())h() + b(x()) = 0, α2p5 + C()aC(x()) = 1, Ã(,) = C.

So, if equation ([\ref=eq]) with conditions ([\ref=cond]) is written in terms of canonical coordinates (let these coordinates will be (x,y)), there may be two possibilities: A(x,y) = ey or A(x,y) = yC. Therefore A = P0.2 then it may be 4 opportunities:

[formula]

Here t(x), s(x) are the arbitrary functions.

Equations of Type I

Let us say that equation ([\ref=eq]) has Type I if conditions ([\ref=cond]) hold, where I1  =  3  /  5.

According to Theorem [\ref=the1] any equation ([\ref=eq]) of Type I can be transformed by point transformations ([\ref=zam]) into the canonical form:

[formula]

The most general point transformations that preserve the canonical form ([\ref=typeI]) are the following ones:

[formula]

Here α, β are some constants. The new equation has the form: [formula] where

[formula]

The proof of Lemma [\ref=le1] follows from the straightward calculations. We apply transformations ([\ref=form]) to the equation ([\ref=typeI]). They must preserve the form of equation. Then in these canonical coordinates the non-trivial invarians ([\ref=inv1]), ([\ref=inv2]), ([\ref=inv6921]) are equal:

[formula]

Let us introduce the additional invariants:

[formula]

Let equation ([\ref=eq]) be an arbitrary equation of Type I. Then it is equivalent to some equation from the following list of nonequivalent equations of Type I:

If J3 = 0 from ([\ref=invT1]) then it is equivalent to y'' = ey.

If J3  ≠  const, J3 = J6, K = 0 from ([\ref=invT1]) then it is equaivalent to y'' = ey + 1.

If J3  ≠  const, J3  ≠  J6, J6  ≠  const, J1 = a = const, K = 0 from ([\ref=invT1]) then it is equaivalent to y'' = ey + y + a.

Two equations of Type I.3 are equivalent if and only if invariant J1 for both equations is the same and equal to constant a.

If J3  ≠  const, J3 = J6, K = k = const  ≠  0 from ([\ref=invT1]) then it is equaivalent to y'' = ey  +  4  /  kx2.

Two equations of Type I.4 are equivalent if and only if invariant K for both equations is the same and equal to constant k  ≠  0.

If J3  ≠  const, J3 = J6, K  ≠  const from ([\ref=invT1]) then it is equaivalent to y'' = ey + s(x), s(x)  ≠  const.

Two equations of Type I.5 are equivalent if and only if after the transformation  = K(x,y),   = J3(x,y) their notations become identical.

If J3  ≠  const, J3  ≠  J6, J6  ≠  const, J1  ≠  const, K  ≠  const from ([\ref=invT1]) then it is equaivalent to y'' = ey + t(x)y + s(x),  t(x)  ≠  0.

Two equations of Type I.6 are equivalent if and only if after the transformation  = J1(x,y),   = J(x,y) their notations become identical.

In the cases I.5 and I.6 functions t(x) and s(x) are definited up to transformations ([\ref=trType1]).

Proof. Let equation ([\ref=eq]) be an arbitrary equation of Type I. Then in the terms of canonical coordinates it has the form ([\ref=typeI]). Let us calculate the invariants ([\ref=invT1]).

If J3 = 0 then (t(x)y  +  s(x)) / ey = 0 [formula] [formula] [formula] Therefore equation ([\ref=eq]) can be reduced into the canonical form y'' = ey.

If J3  ≠  const, J3 = J6, K = 0, then

[formula]

Hence [formula] [formula], accordingly s(x) = s = const  ≠  0. If s = 0 then J3 = 0 and equation has Type I.1. So in the terms of canonical coordinates this equation has the form y'' = ey + s. Let us make the transformation ([\ref=trType1]) then s̃  =  α2s. Choosing the parameter α we could make s̃ = 1. Thus the canonical form is [formula]

If J3  ≠  const, J3  ≠  J6, J6  ≠  const, J1 = a = const, K = 0 then

[formula]

Hence t(x) = t = const  ≠  0, s(x) = s = const and equation has the form y'' = ey + ty + s. Let Y'' = eY + TY + S, T = const  ≠  0, S = const is another equation of this type. These equations are equivalent if and only if T = α2t, S = α2s - α2t ln α2 then between t,  s and T,  S exists the following connection

[formula]

Thus we see that two equations of Type I.3 are equivalent if and only if invariants J1 for both equations are equal to constant a.

Now let us select the canonical form for equations of Type I.3. We make transformation ([\ref=trType1]) and choose the parameter α so that into the new coordinates t̃ = 1, then invariant J1  =  s̃ = a. Hence equation has the canonical form [formula]

If J3  ≠  const, J3 = J6, K = k = const  ≠  0, then

[formula]

Hence [formula] and we have a differential equation on function s(x): [formula]. The solution: [formula] c = const. Now let us choose the canonical form for the equations of Type 1.4. Making the transformation ([\ref=trType1]) we get

[formula]

then select the parameter β such that [formula] for any α. So equation has the canonical form [formula] Two equations of Type I.4 equivalent if and only if invariants K for both equations are equal to constant k  ≠  0.

If J3  ≠  const, J3 = J6, K  ≠  const then

[formula]

Then in terms of canonical coordinates equation has the form y'' = ey + s(x).

Let us solve the equivalence problem for the equations of Type I.5. We have two possibilities. One way is to reduce both equations into the canonical coordinates: y'' = ey + s(x), Y'' = eY + S(X). These equations are equivalent if and only if there exist appropriate α and β such that S(X) = α2s(αX + β).

The other way is based on the observation that for any equation ([\ref=eq]) of Type I.5 invariants K and J3 are functionally independent. So, if the first equation has the form ([\ref=eq]) and depends on coordinates (x,y) and the second equation has the form ([\ref=eq]) and depends on coordinates (X,Y), we can make the invariant point transformation

[formula]

Equations are equivalent if and only if in the term of coordinates (,  ) their notations become identical.

If J3  ≠  const, J3  ≠  J6, J6  ≠  const, J1  ≠  const, K  ≠  const then in terms of canonical coordinates equation has form y'' = ey + t(x)y + s(x),  t(x)  ≠  0.

Let us solve the equivalence problem for the equations of Type I.6. As at the previous case we have two possibilities.

The first way: in terms of canonical coordinates these equations have forms

[formula]

They equivalent if and only if exist constants α and β such that

[formula]

The second way: note that for any equation ([\ref=eq]) of Type I.6 invariants J1 and J are functionally independent. So, we can make the invariant point transformation

[formula]

Equations are equivalent if and only if in the term of coordinates (,) their notations become identical.

Equations of Type II

Let us say that equation ([\ref=eq]) has Type II if conditions ([\ref=cond]) hold, where I1 =  - 9  /  10.

According to Theorem [\ref=the1] any equation ([\ref=eq]) of Type II can be reduced by point transformations ([\ref=zam]) into the canonical form:

[formula]

The most general point transformations that preserve the canonical form ([\ref=typeII]) are the following ones:

[formula]

Here α, β are some constants. In the new coordinates this equation has the following form: [formula] where

[formula]

Then in terms of canonical coordinates the non-trivial invarians ([\ref=inv1]), ([\ref=inv2]), ([\ref=inv6921]):

[formula]

Let us introduce the additional invariants

[formula]

Let equation ([\ref=eq]) be an arbitrary equation of Type II. Then it is equivalent to some equation from the following list of nonequivalent equations of Type II:

If J6 = 0, J9 = 0 from ([\ref=invT2]) then it is equaivalent to y'' =  -  ln y.

If J6  ≠  const, J9 = 0, J = a from ([\ref=invT2]) then it is equaivalent to y'' =  -  ln y + y + a.

Two equations of Type II.2 are equivalent if and only if invariant J for both equations is the same and equals to constant a.

If J6 = 0, J9  ≠  const from ([\ref=invT2]), then the equation is equaivalent to y'' =  -  ln y + s(x), s(x)  ≠  const.

Two equations of Type II.3 are equivalent if and only if after the transformation  = J3(x,y),   = J9(x,y) their notations become identical.

If J6  ≠  const, J9  ≠  const from ([\ref=invT2]) then it is equivalent to y'' =  -  ln y + t(x)y + s(x), t(x)  ≠  0.

Two equations of Type II.4 are equivalent if and only if after the transformation  = J(x,y),   = J6(x,y) their notations become identical.

In the cases II.2, II.4 functions t(x), s(x) are definited up to transformations ([\ref=trTypeII]).

Proof. Let us have the certain equation ([\ref=eq]) of Type II. Then in terms of canonical coordinates it has form ([\ref=typeII]).

If J6 = 0 and J9 = 0 then t(x)y = 0, [formula] [formula] [formula] s(x) = s = const and equation may be reduced into the form y'' =  -  ln y + s. Let us make transformations ([\ref=trTypeII]). Then s̃ = s + 2 / 3 ln α. Choosing the appropriate α we can make s̃ = 0 then equation will be '' =  -  ln .

If J6  ≠  const, J9 = 0, J = a, then [formula] [formula] [formula] [formula] Accordingly t(x) = t = const, s(x) = s = const and equation will be y'' =  -  ln y + ty + s, t  ≠  0. Let we have another equation of Type II.2 such that in terms of canonical coordinates it has the form Y'' =  -  ln Y + TY + S, T = const, T  ≠  0, S = const. These equations equivalent if and only if

[formula]

So we see that two equations of Type II.2 are equivalent if and only if invariants J for both equations are equal to constant a.

Now let us find the canonical form for the equations of Type II.2. After the transformations ([\ref=trTypeII]) [formula] s̃ = s + 2 / 3 ln α. Choosing the appropriate α we can get t̃ = 1. Consequently the canonical form is '' =  -  ln   +   + a.

If J6 = 0, J9  ≠  const, then [formula] s'(x)  ≠  0. Therefore in terms of canonical coordinates equation has form y'' =  -  ln y + s(x), s(x)  ≠  const.

As at the previous case for the equations of Type I we have two possibilities. The first way: in terms of canonical coordinates two equations have forms

[formula]

They equivalent if and only if exist constants α and β such that [formula] The second way: note that for any equation ([\ref=eq]) of the Type II.3 invariants J3 and J9 are functionally independent. So, we can make the invariant point transformation

[formula]

These equations are equivalent if and only if in terms of new coordinates (,) their notations become identical.

If J6  ≠  const, J9  ≠  const then equation is equivalent to y'' =  -  ln y + t(x)y + s(x), t(x)  ≠  0. The first way: in terms of canonical coordinates two equations have forms

[formula]

They equivalent if and only if exist the constants α and β such that

[formula]

The second way: note that for any equation ([\ref=eq]) of the Type II.4 invariants J and J6 are functionally independent. So, we can make the invariant point transformation

[formula]

These equations are equivalent if and only if in terms of new coordinates (,) their notations become identical.

Equations of Type III

Let us say that equation ([\ref=eq]) has Type III if conditions ([\ref=cond]) hold, where I1 =  - 12  /  5.

According to Theorem [\ref=the1] any equation ([\ref=eq]) of the Type III can be reduced by point transformations ([\ref=zam]) into the canonical form:

[formula]

The most general point transformations that preserve the canonical form ([\ref=typeIII]) are the following ones:

[formula]

Here α, β are certain constants. In term of new coordinates equation has form: [formula] where

[formula]

Then in term of canonical coordinates the non-trivial invarians ([\ref=inv1]), ([\ref=inv2]), ([\ref=inv6921]):

[formula]

Let us denote the additional invariants

[formula]

Let equation ([\ref=eq]) be an arbitrary equation of Type III. Then it is equivalent to some equation from the following list of nonequivalent equations of Type III:

If J6 = 0, J9 = 0 from ([\ref=invT3]) then it is equaivalent to y'' = y( ln y - 1).

If J6 = 0, J9 = b2 = const  ≠  0 from ([\ref=invT3]) then it is equaivalent to y'' = y( ln y - 1)  ±  bxy.

Two equations of Type III.2 are equivalent if and only if invariant J9 ([\ref=invT3]) for both equations is the same and equals to the constant b2.

If J6  ≠  const, J9 = 0, J = a from ([\ref=invT3]) then it is equaivalent to y'' = y( ln y - 1) + a.

Two equations of Type III.3 are equivalent if and only if invariant J ([\ref=invT3]) for both equations is the same and equals to constant a.

If J6  ≠  const, J9 = b2 = const  ≠  0 from ([\ref=invT3]) then it is equaivalent to y'' = y( ln y - 1)  ±  bxy + 1.

Two equations of Type III.4 are equivalent if and only if invariant J9 ([\ref=invT3]) for both equations is the same and equals to constant b2.

If J6  ≠  const, J9  ≠  const from ([\ref=invT3]) then it is equaivalent to y'' = y( ln y - 1) + t(x)y + s(x), s(x)  ≠  0.

Two equations of Type III.4 are equivalent if and only if after the transformation  = J(x,y),   = J6(x,y) their notations become identical.

In the case III.5 functions t(x) and s(x) are definited up to transformations ([\ref=trTypeIII]).

Proof. Let us have the certain equation ([\ref=eq]) of Type III. Then in terms of canonical coordinates it has the form ([\ref=typeIII]).

If J6 = 0 and J9 = 0, then [formula], [formula] Therefore t(x) = t = const. Choosing the parameter α from the point transformation ([\ref=trTypeIII]) we can get t̃ = t - ln α  /  2 = 0. Thus the canonical form is [formula]

If J6 = 0 and J9 = b2 = const then [formula] t'(x) =   ±  b = const. So t(x) =   ±  bx + t, t = const. Let's make the point transformation ([\ref=trTypeIII]): t̃() =   ±  b(  ±    +  β) + t - ln α  /  2  =    ±  b + (  ±  bβ + t - ln α  /  2). Choosing the parameters α and β we get t̃() =   ±  b.

It is easy to check that two equation of Type III.2 are equivalent if and only if invariants J9 ([\ref=invT3]) for both equations are equal to the constant b2.

If J6  ≠  const, J9 = 0, then [formula] and [formula] s(x)  ≠  0. Hence t(x) = t = const, s(x) = s = const  ≠  0. Let's make the point transformation ([\ref=trTypeIII]): t̃  =  t - ln α  /  2, [formula] Choosing the parameter α we can make t̃ = 0. At the new coordinates J = s̃ = a. Thus two equations of Type III.3 are equivalent if and only if invariants J for both equations are equal to the constant a.

If J9 = const  ≠  0 then [formula] and t'(x) =   ±  b = const  ≠  0. So t(x) =   ±  bx + t, t = const, s(x) = s = const  ≠  0. Hence t̃() =   ±  b(  ±    +  β) + t - ln α  /  2, [formula] Choosing the parameters α and β we can make t̃  =    ±  b, s̃ = 1. So in terms of new coordinates equation has form '' = ( ln  - 1)  ±  b + 1. It is easy to check that two equation of Type III.4 are equivalent if and only if invariants J9 ([\ref=invT3]) for both equations are equal to the constant b2.

If J3  ≠  const, J9  ≠  const then equation has form y'' = y( ln y - 1) + t(x)y + s(x), s(x)  ≠  0. The first way: two equations of Type III.5 are equivalent if and only if in terms of canonical coordinates condition t(  ±  X + β) +  ln s(  ±  X + β) = T(X) +  ln S(X) holds, where the second equation in terms of canonical coordinates has form

Y'' = Y( ln Y - 1) + T(X)Y + S(X), S(X)  ≠  0.

The second way: note that for any equation ([\ref=eq]) of Type III.5 invariants J and J6 are functionally independent. Hence we can make the invariant point transformation:

[formula]

Equations are equivalent if and only if in terms of coordinates (,) their notations become identical.

Equations of Type IV

Let us say that equation ([\ref=eq]) has Type IV if conditions ([\ref=cond]) hold, where I1  =  3(C  +  5)  /  5C, C = const, C  ≠  0,   - 1,   - 2,   - 5.

According to Theorem [\ref=the1] any equation ([\ref=eq]) of Type IV can be reduced by point transformations ([\ref=zam]) into the canonical form:

[formula]

The most general point transformations that preserve the canonical form ([\ref=typeIV]) are the following ones:

[formula]

Here α, β are some constants. In terms of new coordinates equation has the form: '' = C  +  2  /  ((C  +  1)(C  +  2))  +  t̃()  +  s̃(), where

[formula]

The basic invariants ([\ref=inv1]), ([\ref=inv2]), ([\ref=inv6921]) are

[formula]

The additional invariants

[formula]

Let equation ([\ref=eq]) be an arbitrary equation of Type IV. Then it is equivalent to some equation from the following list of nonequivalent equations of Type IV:

If J1 = 0, J2 = 0 from ([\ref=invT4]) then it is equaivalent to [formula]

If J1 = 0, J2  ≠  0, J9 = 0 from ([\ref=invT4]) then it is equaivalent to [formula].

[formula]

If J1 = 0, J2  ≠  0, J9  ≠  0, K1 = 0, then [formula] [formula]. So s(x) = s1x + s2, s1 = const  ≠  0, s2 = const. Let's make the transformation ([\ref=trTypeIV]), then

[formula]

Choosing the parameters α and β we can make s̃() = , then equation will be

[formula]

If J1 = 0, J2  ≠  0, J9  ≠  0 then [formula] s''(x)  ≠  0. Hence in terms of special coordinates:

[formula]

Let we have two equations of Type IV.4 with the same parameter C. The first way: we reduce both equations in the canonical forms

[formula]

They equivalent if and only if exist the constants α and β such that

[formula]

The second way: note that for any equation ([\ref=eq]) of the Type IV.4 invariants J2 and J9 are functionally independent. So, we can make the invariant point transformation

[formula]

Two equations of Type IV.8 with the same parameter C are equivalent if and only if invariants J for both equations are the same and equal to constant a.

If J1  ≠  0, J9  ≠  0, J = a = const, then [formula], t(x)  ≠  const. Therefore in terms of special coordinates equation has the form

[formula]

1) reduce equations into the canonical forms

[formula]

[formula]

They equivalent if and only if exist the constants α and β such that

[formula]

2) make the invariant point transformation.

[formula]

Note that for any equation ([\ref=eq]) of Type IV.9 invariants J1 and J9 ([\ref=invT4]) are functially independent. Equations are equivalent if and only if in terms of new coordinates (,) their notations become identical.

If J1  ≠  0, J2  ≠  0, J9  ≠  0, K1 = 0, then [formula] and [formula]. So t(x) = t1x + t2, t1 = const  ≠  0, t2 = const; s(x) = s1x + s2, s1 = const  ≠  0, s2 = const. Let us make the transformation ([\ref=trTypeIV]), then

[formula]

[formula]

Choosing the parameters α and β we can make t̃() = , but in this case s̃() = m + n, m = const  ≠  0, n = const. Thus equation has the form

[formula]

Two equations of Type IV.9 with the equal parameter C are equivalent if and only if in terms of canonical coordinates their constants m and n are identical.

If J1  ≠  0, J2  ≠  0, J9  ≠  0, K  ≠  const, J  ≠  const, K1  ≠  0, then in terms of special coordinates equation has the general form

[formula]

2) make the invariant point transformation.

[formula]

Note that for any equation ([\ref=eq]) of Type IV.11 invariants J and J1 ([\ref=invT4]) are functially independent. Equations are equivalent if and only if in terms of new coordinates (,) their notations become identical.

Examples

Equation Painleve III with 3 zero parameters

The Painleve III equation depends on 4 parameters (a,b,c,d)

[formula]

By the paper [\cite=Hietarinta] all equations Painleve III with 3 zero parameters are equivalent

[formula]

where the point transformations 1) and 3) are: [formula] and 2) is: x = 2 / 2,  y = 2.

In this way suppose that a  ≠  0, b = c = d = 0. For the equation PIII(a,0,0,0) conditions ([\ref=cond]) are hold and invariants ([\ref=inv1]) are equal to:

[formula]

As J3 = 0, then according to Theorem [\ref=the2], equation PIII(a,0,0,0) has Type I.1. Let us find the corresponding change of variables. The first point transformation (see [\cite=Babich]) takes equation PIII(a,0,0,0) into the following form: x = et, y = ez, z'' = aet + z.

The second transformation reduces it in the canonical form: [formula] [formula] [formula]

If a = 1, then the second and the third transformations:

[formula]

Equation Painleve II

The Painleve II equation depends on one parameter a

[formula]

It also has form ([\ref=model]) and satisfies to the conditions ([\ref=cond]) with invariant I1  =  18  /  5. According to Theorem [\ref=the5] it has Type IV, case C = 1. Let us calculate the additional invariants

[formula]

We see that the equation PII(a) has Type IV.10 if a  ≠  0 and Type IV.5 if a = 0.

Let us calculate x, y and a via invariants: [formula], [formula], [formula]

Equation ([\ref=eq]) of Type IV is equivalent to Painleve II equation with parameter ±  a if and only if

[formula]

The explicit point transformation is [formula] [formula]

Proof. At first we write the PII(a) equation in the canonical form:

[formula]

Let a = 0, then equation PII(0) is already of Type IV.5.

Let a  ≠  0. If for the certain equation of Type IV.10 conditions ([\ref=p2a]) are hold, then in terms of canonical coordinates

[formula]

It is true if and only if C = 1 and [formula]. So s(x) = s = const  ≠  0. Then [formula] t = const, therefore K1 = 0.

[formula]

has Type IV and invariants I1  =  18  /  5, I3  =  1  /  15, J1 = 0, J2 = 0. Thus it has Type IV.1 with C = 1. By the transformations [formula] y = 2  /  4 it is reduced into the canonical form: '' = 3  /  6.

So equations from the handbook Kamke No. 6.24 and No. 6.140 are equivalent.

[formula]

Emden equation

The Emden equation in the form described in paper [\cite=BordagBandle]:

[formula]

has I1  =  3(n  +  3)  /  (5(n  -  2)), I2 = 0, J2 = 0 hence this equation has Type IV with parameter C = n - 2. Possible cases IV.1, IV.5, IV.6, IV.8 and IV.9.

Invariants ([\ref=invT4]) are the follows:

[formula]

Type IV.1. The Emden equation ([\ref=emden]) has Type IV.1 if and only if invariant J1 = 0.

In this case function λ(x) is the solution of following differential equation:

[formula]

Therefore λ(x) = c2  /  (c1x  +  1)n  +  3, c1,  c2 = const, c2  ≠  0. In this case the Emden equation could be transformed into the canonical form

[formula]

In particular, this equations is equivalent to the Painleve II with the parameter a = 0 if and only if n = 3 and the function λ(x) satisfies to the following equation:

[formula]

Type IV.6. The Emden equation ([\ref=emden]) has Type IV.6 if and only if invariants J1  ≠  0, J9  ≠  0, K = k = const  ≠  0, K1  ≠  0. Then λ(x) satisfies to the following equation

[formula]

and doesn't satisfies to ([\ref=IVJ1]), ([\ref=IVJ9]), ([\ref=IVK1]). Equation ([\ref=emden]) could be transformed into

[formula]

Type IV.9. At the other cases the Emden equation ([\ref=emden]) has Type IV.9. Then exists the special coordinate system, so that in terms of these coordinates equation has form
