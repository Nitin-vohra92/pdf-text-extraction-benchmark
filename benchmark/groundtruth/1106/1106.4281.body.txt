Convergence to type I distribution of the extremes of sequences defined by random difference equation

Introduction

We consider a special case of the following random difference equation

[formula]

where R0 is arbitrary and (Qn,Mn), [formula], are i.i.d. copies of a two dimensional random vector (Q,M), and (Qn,Mn) is independent of Rn - 1. Later on we specialize our discussion to a non-degenerate M, and [formula], a positive constant. Much of the impetus for studying equations like ([\ref=perp-nq]) stems from numerous applications of such schemes in mathematics and other disciplines of science. We refer to [\cite=eg] [\cite=vervaat] for examples of fields in which equation ([\ref=perp-nq]) have been of interest. Further examples of more recent applications are mentioned in [\cite=hw], and for examples of statistical issues arising in studying solutions of [\eqref=perp-nq] see [\cite=unc].

A fundamental theoretical result that goes back to Kesten [\cite=kesten] asserts that if

[formula]

then the sequence (Rn) converges in distribution to a random variable R, which necessarily satisfies distributional identity

[formula]

(see also [\cite=vervaat] for a detailed discussion of the convergence properties of (Rn)). In the same paper Kesten showed that if P(|M| > 1) > 0 and [\eqref=convcond] holds then, under some mild additional conditions on M and Q the limiting distribution is always heavy-tailed, that is, [formula] for a suitably chosen κ > 0. A different proof of this results was given by Goldie in [\cite=goldie]. By contrast, it was shown in [\cite=gg] that in the complementary case [formula] if |Q|  ≤  q then the tail of R has no slower than exponential decay.

Interestingly, much more work has been done in the heavy-tailed situation. This is perhaps at least partially caused by the fact that many of the processes appearing in applications (for example GARCH processes in financial mathematics) are in fact heavy-tailed. Nonetheless, the case [formula] and [formula] contains a number of interesting situations, including the class of Vervaat perpetuities, see e.g. [\cite=vervaat]. Vervaat perpetuities correspond to M being a [formula] random variable for some α > 0 and Q = 1 in which case one gets

[formula]

(some authors prefer not to have a 1 at the beginning which corresponds to taking Q = M). Particular cases of Vervaat perpetuities include the Dickman distribution appearing in number theory (see [\cite=dickman]), in the analysis of the limiting distribution of Quickselect algorithm (see [\cite=mms]), and in the limit theory of functionals of success epochs in iid sequences of random variables [\cite=verber]. Further connections are referenced in [\cite=ht] and we refer there for more information. For recent work on perfect simulation of Vervaat perpetuities see [\cite=fh] or [\cite=df].

In this note we will be interested in the extremal behavior of the sequence (Rn). For any sequence of random variables (Yn) we let (Y*n) be the sequence of partial maxima, i.e. Y*n  =   max k  ≤  nYk, [formula]. With this notation, we will seek constants (an) and (bn) such that for all x

[formula]

where G is a non-degenerate distribution function.

Under the assumptions that [formula] the extremes of the sequence (Rn) when both M and Q are non-negative were studied in [\cite=dhrrdv] and were shown to converge (after suitable normalization) to Fréchet (i.e. Type II) distribution with parameter κ. Here, we consider the complementary case, namely of a light-tailed limiting distribution R. Of course, in this situation one expects convergence in [\eqref=maxconv] to a Gumbel (i.e. a double-exponential or Type I) distribution, provided that there is convergence at all. The latter need not be the case, however. Indeed, if Q = 1 and M has a two-point distribution [formula] then as is seen from [\eqref=verperp] R has a geometric distribution with parameter 1 - p and thus no constants (an), (bn) exist for which [\eqref=maxconv] holds for a non-degenerate distribution G (see [\cite=llr]). Our main aim here is to show that under fairly general and natural conditions on M (and for a degenerate Q) [\eqref=maxconv] does hold for suitable constants (an), (bn) and a double exponential distribution G(x) =  exp ( - e- x), -    ∞   < x <   ∞  .

Extremal behavior

Following the authors of [\cite=dhrrdv] we assume that both M and Q are non-negative. As we mentioned earlier we assume that Q = q > 0 is a constant. So, we consider

[formula]

where Mn and Rn - 1 on the right-hand side are independent and where (Mn) is a sequence of iid copies of a random variable M satisfying

[formula]

(The non-degeneracy assumption is to eliminate the possibility that R itself is degenerate.) Clearly, this is more than [\eqref=convcond] and thus implies the convergence in distribution of (Rn). Furthermore, it has been known since [\cite=gg] that in that case the tail of the limiting variable R is no heavier than exponential. Note that if M is bounded away from 1 then R is actually a bounded random variable. To exclude this situation we assume that the right endpoint of M is 1, that is that

[formula]

Finally, we need to eliminate the possibility that R is a geometric variable. To this end it is enough to assume that

[formula]

since this guarantees that the distribution of R is continuous (see e.g. [\cite=air]).

We will prove the following theorem

Let (Rn) satisfy [\eqref=perp-q] with M satisfying [\eqref=Mass]-[\eqref=nongeom]. Then there exist sequences (an) (bn) such that for every real x

[formula]

proof of Theorem [\ref=mt]

We first outline our proof which generally follows the approach of [\cite=dhrrdv] (see also references therein for earlier developments). Writing out [\eqref=perp-q] explicitly we see that

[formula]

Under our assumption [\eqref=Mass] (as a matter of fact, under the first part of [\eqref=convcond] as well) the product [formula] goes to 0 a.s. Consequently, the extremal behavior of (Rn) is the same regardless of the choice of the initial variable R0. It is particularly convenient to choose R0 so that it satisfies [\eqref=id] as then so does every Rk, [formula], making the sequence (Rn) stationary. Extremal behavior of stationary sequences is quite well understood (see e.g. [\cite=llr]) and we will take advantage of that. To find the extremal behavior of (Rn) one has to do three things:

analyse the extremal behavior of the associated independent sequence (R̂n) consisting of iid random variables equidistributed with R,

verify that the sequence (Rn) satisfies the D(un) condition for sequences (un) of the form un = bn + x / an, for any x and suitably chosen sequences (an), (bn), and

show that the sequence (Rn) has the extremal index and find its value.

Some of the difficulties with carrying out this program are caused by the fact that, contrary to the heavy - tailed situation, much less is known about the tail asymptotics in the case of light tails. A notable exception are Vervaat perpetuities (see [\cite=verber] for a discussion). General results on light-tail case are scarce (see [\cite=gg] [\cite=hw] [\cite=h]) and less precise than Kesten's result in the heavy - tailed situation. As a consequence, less precise information about the norming constants (an) (bn) will be available. Our substitute for Kesten's result will be two-sided bounds obtained recently in [\cite=h].

We will treat the three items above in separate subsections.

Associated independent sequence

We appeal to the general theory of extremes as described in e.g. [\cite=llr]. First, we know from [\cite=air] that [\eqref=nongeom] and non-degeneracy assumption on M imply that R has continuous distribution function FR. Therefore, the condition (1.7.3) of Theorem 1.7.13 of [\cite=llr] is satisfied and thus, for every x > 0 there exist un = un(x) such that

[formula]

In fact, since R is continuous un may be taken to be

[formula]

where FR is the probability distribution function of R. The question now is whether un's may be chosen to be linear functions of x i.e. whether there exist constants an and bn, [formula] such that for x > 0 we have

[formula]

To address that question we will utilize a recent result of [\cite=h] which states that there exist absolute constants ci, i = 0,1,2,3 such that for sufficiently large y > 0

[formula]

where, following [\cite=gg], for 0 < δ < 1 we set

[formula]

Notice that by [\eqref=upend] pδ is strictly positive for δ∈(0,1). Now, if

[formula]

then

[formula]

Therefore, if wn are chosen so that

[formula]

then un  ≥  wn. By the same argument, if vn are such that

[formula]

then [formula] so that un  ≤  vn. Hence for every x > 0

[formula]

and thus for every [formula] there would exist [formula] such that

[formula]

If both (vn) and (wn) were linear, say,

[formula]

for some (an'), (bn'), (an''), and (bn'') then [\eqref=linu] would hold with

[formula]

It therefore suffices to show the existence of linear norming for partial maxima of iid random variables (Wn) whose common distribution FW satisfies

[formula]

where pc1 / y is given by [\eqref=pdelta] for some fixed random variable M satisfying [\eqref=Mass]-[\eqref=nongeom].

In accordance with [\cite=llr] to show that

[formula]

holds for every real x, the constants (an') and bn') must be constructed so that for every such x

[formula]

i.e. that

[formula]

Choose bn' so that

[formula]

Then the left-hand side of [\eqref=tailW] is

[formula]

To choose (an') first note that the difference of logarithms in the first summand is negative. Hence, if for any n, an'  ≤   - K ln pc1 / bn' for some K < c0 then the exponent is no more than - xc0 / K <  - x. Therefore, for any admissible choice of (an') we must have lim inf nan' /  ln pc1 / bn'  ≤   - c0 which implies in particular that an'bn'  →    ∞  . Thus, the exponent in the above formula is asymptotic to

[formula]

We can further assume that for each n 1 - c / bn' is a differentiability point of FM and that the derivative, fM, is finite at 1 - c1 / bn'. It then follows that the exponent is asymptotic to

[formula]

and thus we may choose

[formula]

D(un) condition

To check that D(un) condition holds for sequences of the form bn + x / an we proceed in the same fashion as [\cite=dhrrdv]; the argument there was, in turn, based on [\cite=r-ap86]. Recall that, according to [\cite=llr] it suffices to show that if [formula] are such that j1 - ir  ≥  λn for λ > 0 then

[formula]

as n  →    ∞  . Set [formula] and [formula] and for any set A of positive integers let R*A  =   max a∈ARa.

It follows from [\eqref=perp-q] that for j > i we have

[formula]

where, for j > i we have set

[formula]

Hence, for any εn > 0 we obtain

[formula]

Note that Rk and Sn,m are independent whenever, m  ≥  k so that {Ri: i∈I} and {Sj,ir: j∈J} are independent, and hence we get

[formula]

Also,

[formula]

which further leads to

[formula]

By essentially the same argument we also get

[formula]

Combining these two estimates we obtain

[formula]

Thus condition D(un) will be verified once we show that both terms in the sum on the right-hand side vanish as n  →    ∞  . To handle the first term we use stationarity and the fact that js  ≤  n to find that the maximum above is bounded by

[formula]

Recall that (un) satisfy [\eqref=limun] and [\eqref=linu]. Thus, setting εn  =  ε / an with ε > 0 sufficiently small we get

[formula]

Turning attention to the second term, using [formula] we see that

[formula]

Intersect the event underneath this probability with {R > 2bn} and its complement to see that this term is bounded by

[formula]

Furthermore, since for any T > 0 and sufficiently large n, [formula], the first term [\eqref=r0tail] is bounded by

[formula]

and thus goes to 0 upon letting T  →    ∞  . Turning to the second term in [\eqref=r0tail] we see that by Markov's inequality and independence of Mk's it is bounded by

[formula]

We need to see that this vanishes as n  →    ∞  . Recall that EM < 1 and j1 - ir  ≥  λn where λ > 0, so that [formula] decays exponentially fast in n. Furthermore,

[formula]

Recall that bn' and bn'' satisfy [\eqref=bn] (with different constants). Thus they both are O( ln n) as are ln pc1 / bn' and ln pc3 / bn''. Hence,

[formula]

Since fM is an integrable function, we may assume that [formula] as n  →    ∞  . Finally, recall that (bn') satisfies [\eqref=bn]. Therefore,

[formula]

where the last inequality follows from the fact that bn'  →    ∞   as n  →    ∞   which is evident from [\eqref=bn]. It follows that nanbn has a polynomial growth in n and thus that for every ε > 0 [\eqref=EMbound] goes to 0 as n  →    ∞  .

Extremal index

We establish the following fact about the extremal index of (Rn). It implies, in particular, that if M does not have an atom at 1, then the extremal behavior of (Rn) is exactly the same as it would be for independent Rn's.

Again following the authors of [\cite=dhrrdv] we rely on Theorem 4.1 of Rootzén [\cite=r-jap88]. Since we have shown that D(un) holds for every sequence un of the form bn + x / an, x > 0, it remains to verify condition (4.3) of that theorem i.e. to show that

[formula]

To this end, for given ε > 0, let [formula]. Then

[formula]

By Markov property, for [formula] the first probability on the right-hand side is

[formula]

Continuing in the same fashion we find that

[formula]

So, clearly

[formula]

On the other hand,

[formula]

as n  →    ∞   by the very choice of (un). Thus

[formula]

so that

[formula]

and hence

[formula]

It follows that

[formula]

We now turn to evaluating

[formula]

It is clear that if p0 > 0 then for every n such that un  ≥  q we have [formula] so assume that p0 = 0 and write

[formula]

It remains to show that the numerator in the last expression is of lower order than the denominator. To do that, let (tn) be a sequence converging to infinity but in such a way that tn = o(bn). Then

[formula]

Note that the probability underneath the integral is an increasing function of t. Bounding it trivially by 1 in the second term we see that this term is bounded by [formula]. This can be further bounded by

[formula]

whenever antn  ≥  T. It follows by the choice of (un) and D(un) condition that

[formula]

for arbitrarily large T and sufficiently large n and thus it vanishes as n  →    ∞  . The first integral is bounded by

[formula]

Since the first term goes to p0 = 0 as n  →    ∞  , we see that this term is [formula] as n  →    ∞  . This shows that the extremal index is 1 when p0 = 0 and completes the proof.

Remarks

. The main drawback of Theorem 1 is that it does not give a good handle on the norming constants (an) and (bn). This is generally caused by a lack of precise information about the tails of the limiting random variable R. However, even in the rare cases in which more precise information about tails of R is available, the formulas seem to be too complicated to make the precise statements about (an) and (bn) practical. For example, when q = 1 and M has [formula] distribution, α > 0, (i.e. R is a Vervaat perpetuity) then Vervaat [\cite=verber] (based on earlier arguments of de Bruijn [\cite=dB]) found the expression for the density of R. This, in principle, could be used to get precise enough asymptotics of the tail function of R and thus determine the asymptotic values of (bn) and (an). However, the nature of these formulas, makes obtaining explicit asymptotic expressions for (an) and (bn) difficult if not impossible. As far as we know, Vervaat perpetuities provide the only class of examples (within our restrictions on M and Q) for which the asymptotics of the tail function is known. On the other hand, Theorem [\ref=mt] typically gives the order of the magnitude of (an) and (bn).

. The expression [\eqref=an] for (an') often simplifies to an'  ~   - c0 ln pc1 / bn' (with corresponding simplification for (an)). This will happen, for example, whenever p0 = 0 and δfM(1 - δ) / pδ is bounded as [formula], in particular, when M is [formula] random variable, α,β > 0. In that case, bn' may be chosen to be asymptotic to [formula] and then an'  ~  c0β ln  ln n. Hence, (an) and (bn) are of order ln  ln n and ln n /  ln  ln n, respectively. Note that Vervaat perpetuity corresponds to β = 1 and Dickman distribution to α  =  β = 1.

. There are, however, situations for which the above remark is not true. The following situation was considered in [\cite=hw]. Let M have density given by

[formula]

where K = Kr is a normalizing constant. Then, as [formula],

[formula]

so that

[formula]

On the other hand,

[formula]

so that both terms appearing in [\eqref=an] are of the same order. Here again, the norming constants (an), (bn) in Theorem [\ref=mt] may be determined up to absolute multiplicative factors and are of order ( ln n)1 / r and ( ln n)(r - 1) / r, respectively.

. Consider another example from [\cite=hw] in which

[formula]

Then (see [\cite=hw]) ln pδ  ~    -  δe1 / δ as [formula]. Similarly, one can check that

[formula]

so this time the first term in the expression [\eqref=an] is of higher order than the second. It follows from the asymptotics above that an'  ~  ( ln n) / c0c1 and bn'  ~  c1 ln  ln n and hence (an), (bn) are of order ln n and ln  ln n, respectively.
