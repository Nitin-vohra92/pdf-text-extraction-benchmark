Introduction

Among its many and deep predictions, the Langlands conjectures attach families of L-functions to each automorphic representation. The Langlands L-functions are expected to have holomorphic continuations - or sometimes meromorphic continuations with poles only at certain specific points - and to satisfy functional equations. This has been established in relatively few cases so far, generally by one of two methods. One, the Langlands-Shahidi method, deduces the meromorphic continuation and functional equation from the analogous properties of Eisenstein series - Eisenstein series induced from the automorphic representation in question. The other is called the method of integral representations, although it is perhaps more a collection of very clever ideas than a systematic method. These integral representations express the L-function as an integral of matrix coefficients (i.e., automorphic forms), or products of matrix coefficients, of the automorphic representation; the functional equation then follows by applying some appropriate involution, which has the desired effect on the argument of the L-function.

The Langlands-Shahidi method presents the functional equation in exactly the form conjectured by Langlands, with the Gamma factors predicted by him. Its range of applicability is limited, because the group which acts on the automorphic representation must arise as Levi component of a maximal parabolic in some ambient group. The method of integral representations typically does not produce the Gamma factors directly. As a result, this method cannot always rule out all unwanted poles of the L-function. The same is true, for different reasons, of the Langlands-Shahidi method.

In the papers we have introduced a new approach: we work not with matrix coefficients of an automorphic representation, as in the method of integral representations, but with its automorphic distribution. The latter, in effect, is the datum of the embedding of the automorphic representation into [formula]; it does not involve the choice of particular matrix coefficients. Our approach has the advantage of making the Gamma factors computable and allows us to rule out all the unwanted poles. There is a cost, of course - distributions are more difficult to work with than C∞ functions.

In this paper we develop an important analytic tool for our program, the analogue, in the setting of automorphic distributions, of Rankin-Selberg type integrals. Those are integral representations of L-functions, as integrals of products of automorphic forms - i.e., multilinear pairings of automorphic forms. The analytic properties of the L-functions are then deduced from the integrals in question. Our main result, theorem [\ref=mainthm], provides an alternative by establishing an invariant multilinear pairing of automorphic distributions. In our forthcoming paper [\cite=extsquare] we shall use a particular instance of our pairings to obtain new analytic information, such as the full analytic continuation, of the exterior square L-function for GL(2n). We intend to use theorem [\ref=mainthm] in the future to obtain new results on other L-functions, results that are inaccessible by the Rankin-Selberg and Langlands-Shahidi methods. Indeed, for every integral representation we are aware of, there exists an analogous distributional pairing of the type covered by theorem [\ref=mainthm].

Statement of the main theorem

Our main result involves two reductive Lie groups, G and H. We suppose that both are finite covers - typically but not always the trivial cover - of the groups of real points of algebraic reductive subgroups [formula] and [formula], respectively. By an arithmetic subgroup Γ  ⊂  G, we mean a subgroup commensurate with the inverse image, in G, of the group of integral points [formula]. We use the same terminology in the case of H, of course. We shall suppose that G is realized as a subgroup of H, via an inclusion

[formula]

that is defined over [formula];  in other words, the inclusion is compatible with a [formula]-homomorphism [formula]. It then follows that any arithmetic subgroup of ΓH  ⊂  H intersects G in an arithmetic subgroup ΓG  ⊂  G. To simplify various statements, we suppose that

[formula]

In the context of automorphic forms on H, that is not a restrictive hypothesis: any automorphic form on which the center of H acts according to a character is completely determined by its restriction to the derived group

[formula]

Smoothing the integrand

In this section we will first prove the invariance and smoothness properties asserted in theorem [\ref=mainthm], and then give a construction of Fτ,q,ψ,φ as an integral of an automorphic form on H in lemma [\ref=lem:smoothing]. The integral is then used in the following section to prove the remaining properties asserted in the theorem.

We continue with the hypotheses and notation of the previous section, and return briefly to the definition ([\ref=hypo5]) of the averaging operator Aψ  . Like the space of distributions on any C∞ manifold, C-    ∞(Y,E) has an intrinsic topology as complete, locally convex, Hausdorff topological vector space. These are precisely the properties one needs to define the integral of a continuous, compactly supported function with values in a topological vector space. The action of H on C-    ∞(Y,E) is continuous by general principles. It follows that [formula], for τ∈C-    ∞(Y,E)ΓH, can be regarded as a continuous function, defined on the compact manifold U / ΓU, with values in the topological vector space C-    ∞(Y,E). As such it has a well defined integral, which represents Aψτ.

Let us first examine the smoothness and the invariance properties asserted by the theorem. For u∈U,

[formula]

and therefore, in view of the (U   ·  G)-equivariance of [formula],

[formula]

In terms of the identification U   ·  G≃U  ×  G, the distribution [formula] transforms according to the character ψ in the U-variable. Without loss of information, we can set the U-variable equal to the identity and - temporarily - regard [formula] as distribution on G. Convolution with a compactly supported smooth function turns any distribution on G into a smooth function. We then put the U-variable back in and conclude:

[formula]

for every φ∈C∞(G). Convolution on the right commutes with left translation. Hence, for u∈U, ([\ref=smoothing2]) implies

[formula]

Now suppose g∈G, u,u1∈U. Then, in view of ([\ref=hypo4]b) and ([\ref=smoothing5]),

[formula]

so   r(u)Fτ,q,ψ,φ  =  ψ(u)Fτ,q,ψ,φ  . Since Aψτ is ΓG-invariant on the left, since [formula] is G-equivariant, and since right and left translation commute,

[formula]

These are the smoothness and the invariance properties of Fτ,q,ψ,φ  , as asserted.

For the proof of rapid decay in the next section, we need to work with an auxiliary function Φτ,q,ψ,φ,φU, whose definition involves the choice of some φU∈C∞c(U), in addition to τ, ψ, and φ. We impose the normalization conditions

[formula]

and regard [formula] as a scalar valued distribution on H, via ([\ref=evb2]) and ([\ref=erep2]). That allows us to consider

[formula]

as a scalar distribution on H. Recall that s∈H, as defined in ([\ref=sdef]), relates the base points y0∈Y and [formula].

Φτ,q,ψ,φ,φU is a ΓH-automorphic form on H - i.e., a ΓH-invariant C∞ function of uniformly moderate growth, which transforms finitely under the action of the algebra of bi-invariant differential operators on H. Moreover, for all g∈G,

[formula]

Proof: Let   E*  →  Y denote the H-invariant vector bundle dual to   E, and [formula] the top exterior power of the cotangent bundle of Y - i.e., the line bundle whose C∞ sections are smooth measures on Y. We shall produce a smooth section ω of the tensor product,

[formula]

here [formula] denotes the contraction between [formula] and [formula], resulting in a scalar valued, distribution coefficient form of top degree on the compact manifold Y. As such, it can be integrated over Y against any smooth function, in particular the constant function 1.

We assume the existence of ω for the moment. In section [\ref=sec:mainthm] we mentioned that C-    ∞(Y,E) is the space of distribution vectors V∞ for an admissible, representation (π,V) of H, of finite length, on a Hilbert space. Analogously its topological dual [formula] can be regarded as the space of C∞ vectors (V')∞ for the dual representation (π',V'). If we now let 〈 , 〉 denote the pairing between V-    ∞ and (V')∞, we can rewrite the equality in ([\ref=smoothing8.1]) as

[formula]

Since [formula] is a smooth function on H, with values in the topological vector space   V-    ∞,  and since the pairing is linear and continuous in each variable, the description ([\ref=smoothing8.2]) exhibits Φτ,q,ψ,φ,φU as a C∞ function. Moreover, any function of this type, with τ∈(V-    ∞)ΓH, is a C∞ automorphic form [\cite=rapiddecay].

We continue to assume the existence of ω. We shall establish the identity stated at the end of the lemma. Since it only involves the values of Φτ,q,ψ,φ,φU on U   ·  G, we now regard this function as defined on U  ·  G, rather than on H as in ([\ref=smoothing8]). Recall the definition of the averaging operator Aψ in ([\ref=hypo5]). Left and right translation commute, hence

[formula]

At the first step of this chain of equalities, we have used the definition ([\ref=smoothing8]) of Φτ,q,ψ,φ,φU, the definition ([\ref=hypo5]) of   Aψ  ,  as well as the characterization of the map [formula] in ([\ref=hypo1.6]); at the second step we have used the definition of Fτ,q,ψ,φ in the statement of the main theorem; and finally, in the third step, the transformation law ([\ref=smoothing6]) and the normalization ([\ref=smoothing7]) of φU.

We shall construct ω first as a smooth, compactly supported,   E-valued measure on O. Since O is open in Y, we can then regard ω as an element of [formula]. Recall the definition, above ([\ref=hypo1.1]), of (UG)ø as the isotropy subgroup of   U   ·  G   at [formula]. Since   U   ·  G   and   P   are defined, respectively, over [formula] and over [formula],

[formula]

is an [formula]-subgroup of   H  . We define

[formula]

Note that   U   ·  G   is unimodular because of ([\ref=hypo1]d). Haar measure on this group can be described as the product   du  dg   of the Haar measures on U and G. The normalizations ([\ref=smoothing7]) imply that   f0  du  dg   is well-defined, independently of the scaling of   du   and   dg  . We let (μ*,E*) denote the representation of P dual to (μ,E), and choose e*∈E* such that

[formula]

Using this notation, we interpret ([\ref=smoothing8]) as an identity between distributions on H,

[formula]

The group (UG)ø may not be unimodular. We pick a left invariant Haar measure dv  ;  the particular normalization will turn out not to matter. Averaging first over (UG)ø and integrating the result over the quotient   (U   ·  G) / (UG)ø  , we find

[formula]

here   du  dg / dv   is regarded as smooth measure on   (U   ·  G) / (UG)ø   in the obvious manner.

All along we have used ([\ref=evb2]) to regard τ as E-valued distribution on H, transforming under right translation by p∈P according to μ(p- 1). Hence

[formula]

The C∞ function   f:U   ·  G  →  E*  ,  defined by

[formula]

is well defined because the support of any left translate of f0 intersects   (UG)ø   in a compact subset. As direct consequence of the construction,

[formula]

That, in analogy to ([\ref=hypo1.4]) with C∞ in place of C-    ∞, allows us to regard f as a C∞ section of [formula]. The fact that f0 has compact support in   U   ·  G   implies the compact support, modulo (UG)ø, of f,

[formula]

At this point we can reinterpret the outer integral in ([\ref=smoothing9.6]) as the integral of the smooth, compactly supported,   E*-valued measure

[formula]

against the   E-valued distribution section [formula]. In effect, we have verified ([\ref=smoothing8.1]), completing the proof of the lemma. [formula]

To construct ω in the preceding proof, we averaged f0 over (UG)0 on the right, and f0 involved the function φ as a factor. Hence:

If the support of φ is kept fixed, the dependence of ω on φ is bounded in Ck norm, for every [formula].

Rapid decay

In this section we finish the proof of theorem [\ref=mainthm], using lemma [\ref=lem:smoothing] as a main tool. We shall use the results of [\cite=rapiddecay], in particular theorem 4.7 of that paper. The notation there differs from our current notation, since the two papers were written for different purposes. The role of the current ambient group H, or of its factors Hj in ([\ref=cuspidal1.1]), is played by G in [\cite=rapiddecay], and the role of the unipotent group U by N1. The group G in [\cite=rapiddecay] satisfies exactly the same hypotheses as our ambient group H. Since our current G is reductive and defined over [formula],  it can be extended to a Levi component, defined over [formula],  of the parabolic subgroup PU  ⊂  H. Thus we may assume that the Langlands decomposition in ([\ref=hypo1]b) is defined over [formula]. That, in view of ([\ref=hypo4]), makes G a reductive [formula]-subgroup of the group denoted by L in [\cite=rapiddecay]. If L1  ⊂  L2 is an inclusion of real reductive groups defined over [formula],  any Siegel set in L1 is contained in the intersection of L1 with an appropriately chosen Siegel set in L2. Thus, for statements about rapid decay on Siegel sets of automorphic forms on some ambient group, any decay statement for L2 directly implies the analogous statement for L1. In our words, for our purposes it is really irrelevant whether the current G is a subgroup of the L in [\cite=rapiddecay], or all of it.

Let us restate theorem 4.7 of [\cite=rapiddecay] in our current notation. We consider the automorphic form Φτ,q,ψ,φ,φU on H associated to a cuspidal automorphic distribution   τ∈C-    ∞(Y,E) and [formula] as in ([\ref=smoothing8.1]); in the proof of lemma [\ref=lem:smoothing], ω was constructed in terms of   q,ψ,φ,φU  ,  of course. Then for any Siegel set [formula], any c in the inverse image of [formula] in G - cf. the discussion at the beginning of section [\ref=sec:mainthm] - and any [formula], there exists a constant C > 0 such that

[formula]

When Fτ,q,ψ,φ(u  c  g) is defined in terms of Φτ,q,ψ,φ,φU by the formula in lemma [\ref=lem:smoothing], the above estimate directly implies

[formula]

A finite number of translates [formula] cover [formula], so ([\ref=decay2]) implies the integrability of Fτ,q,ψ,φ(u  c  g) over [formula], at least when τ is cuspidal.

The preceding argument must be modified when τ is only cuspidal with respect to one of the factors in a factorization ([\ref=cuspidal1.1]) - say with respect to H1 for definiteness. In that situation [\cite=rapiddecay] asserts the simultaneous rapid decay in the first factor and moderate growth in the second for   Φτ,q,ψ,φ,φU(h1h2)  ,  provided h1 varies in a Siegel set [formula] and h2 over H2. Rapid decay trumps moderate growth when   Φτ,q,ψ,φ,φU   is restricted to U   ·  G  ; this depends on the hypothesis ([\ref=cuspidal1.11]), of course. Thus both ([\ref=decay1]) and ([\ref=decay2]) remain valid even in the partially cuspidal case.

Only two assertions remain to be verified to complete the proof of theorem [\ref=mainthm]. First of all, we need to show that the integral

[formula]

depends only on the total integral of the smoothing function φ, but not otherwise on the particular choice of φ. Since the measure on [formula] is G-invariant on the right, we can right translate the argument g by any fixed g2∈G without changing the value of the integral ([\ref=smoothing16]). Equivalently, we can replace φ by [formula] without affecting the integral. On the infinitesimal level this means that the integral vanishes whenever [formula] is the left infinitesimal translate of some φ̃∈C∞c(G) by some [formula]. Thus the integral ([\ref=smoothing16]) depends only on the image of φ in the quotient

[formula]

Since G is parallelizable, this quotient represents the top cohomology group of the de Rham complex with compact support. As such, it is naturally dual to [formula], and the duality is implemented by integration over the various connected components of G. If G is connected, we can conclude that

[formula]

which implies the conclusion we want. The case of several connected components reduces readily to the connected case; what matters here is that replacing φ by [formula], with g2∈G, does not affect the value of the integral.

The preceding argument involves interchanging the order of differentiation and integration. To make this legitimate, one needs to know that the absolute convergence of the integral of Fτ,q,ψ,φ over [formula] can be estimated - when τ, ψ, and the support of φ are kept fixed - in terms of some Ck norm on φ. Recall the remark [\ref=rem:omega]. Since   Fτ,ψ,φ   was expressed in terms of the automorphic form   Φτ,ψ,φ,φU  ,  which involves φ via ω in the identity ([\ref=smoothing8.2]), we need to quantify the decay of   Φτ,ψ,φ,φU   in terms of some Ck norm of ω, again assuming τ is fixed. In the notation of [\cite=rapiddecay], ω corresponds to the vector v. The estimate in that theorem depends linearly on the Ck norm of v, which provides the necessary justification.

As was remarked earlier, for us holomorphic dependence of a distribution on a complex parameter means dependence in the "weak sense" - i.e., the integral of the distribution against any test function depends holomorphically on the parameter in question. According to ([\ref=smoothing8.1]), the values of the function Φτ,q,ψ,φ,φU can be interpreted as the result of paring the distribution section τ of the vector bundle E over the compact manifold Y against a smooth measure with values in the dual vector bundle. Thus, if τ depends holomorphically on a complex parameter, then so does the function Φτ,q,ψ,φ,φU, and in view of lemma [\ref=lem:smoothing], also the function Fτ,q,ψ,φ. This completes the proof of theorem [\ref=mainthm].
