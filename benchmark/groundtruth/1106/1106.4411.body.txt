Note on the minimal size of a graph with generalized connectivity κ3  =  2

Introduction

We follow the terminology and notations of [\cite=Bondy], and all graphs considered here are always finite and simple. As usual, we denote the numbers of vertices and edges in G by n(G) and e(G) (or simply n and e), and these two basic parameters are called the order and size of G, respectively. A stable set in a graph is a set of vertices no two of which are adjacent. A vertex with degree one in a tree is called a leaf. The connectivity κ(G) of a graph G is defined as the minimum cardinality of a set Q of vertices of G such that G - Q is disconnected or trivial. A well-known theorem of Whitney [\cite=Whitney] provides an equivalent definition of the connectivity. For each 2-subset S = {u,v} of vertices of G, let κ(S) denote the maximum number of internally disjoint uv-paths in G. Then κ(G) = min{κ(S)}, where the minimum is taken over all 2-subsets S of V(G).

In [\cite=Chartrand], the authors generalized the concept of connectivity as follows. Let G be a nontrivial connected graph of order n and k an integer with 2  ≤  k  ≤  n. For a set S of k vertices of G, let κ(S) denote the maximum number [formula] of edge-disjoint trees [formula] in G such that [formula] for every pair i,j of distinct integers with [formula] (note that the trees are vertex-disjoint in [formula]). The k-connectivity, denoted by κk(G), of G is then defined by κk(G) = min{κ(S)}, where the minimum is taken over all k-subsets S of V(G). Obviously, κ2(G) = κ(G).

This paper is a further development of our early work [\cite=LLS], where we determined the minimal number of edges of a graph with κ3  =  2, i.e., for a graph G of order n and size e(G) with κ3(G) = 2, we proved that [formula], and the lower bound is sharp by constructing a class of graphs, only [formula] and n  ≠  10. Note that the number of edges is integral and so the order of the graph attaining the lower bound must be a multiple of 5. On the other hand, since e(G) is an integer, the lower bound can be naturally improved to [formula]. In this paper, we want to show that for all n  ≥  4 but n = 9,10, the lower bound [formula] is best possible, whereas for n = 9,10 we give examples to show that [formula] is the best possible lower bound. This gives a clear picture on the minimal size of a graph of order n with generalized connectivity κ3  =  2.

Preliminaries

Before proceeding, we list some known results in [\cite=LLS] and [\cite=LLZ].

If G is a connected graph with minimum degree δ, then κ3(G)  ≤  δ. In particular, if there are two adjacent vertices of degree δ, then κ3(G)  ≤  δ - 1.

For a positive integer k  ≠  2, let [formula] be a cycle of length 4k. Add k new vertices [formula] to C, and join zi to xi and xi + k, for 1  ≤  i  ≤  k. The resulting graph is denoted by H. Then, the 3-connectivity of H is 2, namely, κ3(H) = 2.

For any connected graph G of order 10 and size 12, κ3(G) = 1.

Remark 2.1: Note that there exists a graph G such that n = 10, e(G) = 13 and κ3(G) = 2, as shown in Figure 1.

Now we turn to the graphs of order 9 and size 11.

For any connected graph G of order 9 and size 11, κ3(G) = 1.

Proof. Assume, to the contrary, that there is a connected graph G of order n = 9 and size m = 11 with κ3(G) = 2. By Lemma [\ref=lem1], we have the minimum degree δ(G)  ≥  2. Denote by X the set of vertices of degree 2 in G. It follows that 2m = Σv∈V(G)d(v)  ≥  2|X| + 3(n - |X|), namely, |X|  ≥  3n - 2m = 5. On the other hand, by Lemma [\ref=lem1] again, we get that X is a stable set. Let m' be the number of edges joining two vertices belonging to Y, where Y = V(G) - X. It is clear that m = 2|X| + m'. So [formula]. Now we can conclude that |X| = 5, |Y| = 4, m' = 1 and every vertex in Y has degree exactly 3. Set X = {x1,x2,x3,x4,x5} and Y = {y1,y2,y3,y4}. Since m' = 1, without loss of generality, suppose that y1y2 is the only edge.

Case 1: There is a vertex in X that is adjacent to both y1 and y2.

Note that G is a simple connected graph and every vertex in X has degree 2. It is not hard to get that G is isomorphic to the graph as shown in Figure 2. Then observe that it is impossible to find two internally-disjoint trees connecting the vertices x1, x2 and x4, contrary to our assumption.

Case 2: There is no vertex in X that is adjacent to both y1 and y2.

Subcase 2.1: For every 2-subset {yi,yj} of Y other than {y1,y2}, there is a vertex in X that is adjacent to both yi and yj, where 1  ≤  i  ≠  j  ≤  5.

Note that there are exactly five vertices in X and five 2-subsets of Y other than {y1,y2}, namely, {y1,y3},{y1,y4},{y2,y3}, {y2,y4},{y3,y4}. Thus, we may assume that G is isomorphic to the graph as shown in Figure 3. Consider the three vertices x1, x2 and x5, and we can get κ3(G) = 1, contrary to our assumption.

Subcase 2.2: Except {y1,y2}, there exists another 2-subset such that no vertex in X is adjacent to both of the vertices in that subset.

In such a situation, there must exist some 2-subset {yi,yj} such that at least two vertices in X are adjacent to both yi and yj, where 1  ≤  i  ≠  j  ≤  5. If {yi,yj}  =  {y3,y4}, it is not hard to get that there must exist a vertex in X that is adjacent to both y1 and y2, contrary to the case. So without loss of generality, we may assume that {yi,yj}  =  {y1,y3}. Then we can get G is isomorphic to the graph as shown in Figure 4. Observe that it is impossible to find two internally-disjoint trees connecting the vertices x1, x4 and x5, contrary to our assumption.

The proof is complete.

Remark 2.2: Notice that there exists a graph G such that n = 9, e(G) = 12 and κ3(G) = 2, as shown in Figure 5.

Next we describe an operation on a vertex of degree 2.

For a vertex u of degree 2, to smooth u is to delete u and then add an edge between its neighbors. Obviously, performing such an operation, the numbers of vertices and edges decrease by one, respectively. Moreover, the degrees of the remaining vertices are not changed.

Let G be a graph such that the set X of vertices of degree 2 is nonempty. Denote by G' the new graph obtained by smoothing a vertex in X, and then we have κ3(G')  ≥  κ3(G).

Proof. Let u be a vertex in X and {w1,w2} the neighbor set of u. Suppose that G' is obtained by smoothing u. Clearly, V(G') = V(G) - u. For any three vertices v1, v2 and v3 of G', let S = {v1,v2,v3}. Obviously, S  ⊆  V(G). Let T be a tree connecting S in G. Note that if v is a leaf of T, we can assume that v∈S. Otherwise, T' = T - v is still a tree connecting S and uses less vertices. Now if u∈V(T), then we can see that T' = T - u + w1w2 is exactly a tree connecting S in G'. If u∉V(T), the operation of smoothing u has nothing to do with T and so T is still a tree connecting S in G'. Therefore, it is not hard to get that κG'(S)  ≥  κG(S). From the definition of κ3, the conclusion that κ3(G')  ≥  κ3(G) follows.

Remark 2.3: For a given G, if we successively do the operation of smoothing a vertex of degree 2 more than once, the final graph is denoted by G'. We can also get κ3(G')  ≥  κ3(G).

Lower bound

If G is a graph of order n with κ3(G) = 2, then [formula] and the lower bound is sharp.

Note that the number of edges is integral and so the order of the graph attaining the lower bound must be a multiple of 5. In [\cite=LLS], we showed that for all positive integer k other than 2, there exists a graph of order n = 5k which attains the lower bound. On the other hand, since e(G) is an integer, the lower bound can be improved to [formula]. Naturally, we want to know whether there is a graph of order n attaining the lower bound for any positive integer n.

If G is a graph of order n with κ3(G) = 2, then [formula]. Moreover, the lower bound is sharp for all n  ≥  4 and n  ≠  9,10.

Proof. Since the number of edges must be an integer, by Lemma [\ref=lem6], the lower bound [formula] is obvious.

Note that all graphs considered here are always simple. Therefore, any graph attaining the lower bound must have at least four vertices. Moreover, by Lemmas [\ref=lem3] and [\ref=lem4], we know that there is no simple connected graph G of order 9 and size 11 or order 10 and size 12 such that κ3(G) = 2.

For n = 8, there is a graph G' of order n such that κ3(G') = 2 as shown in Figure 6. Moreover, [formula], which means that G' attains the lower bound for n = 8.

Now, smooth a vertex of degree 2 in G'. Clearly, the resulting graph G'' is simple and δ(G'') = 2. By Lemma [\ref=lem5], we can get κ3(G'')  ≥  (κ(G') = 2) and so clearly κ3(G'') = 2. Moreover, n = 8 - 1 = 7 and [formula]. The graph G'' is what we want to find for n = 7. Similarly, the graph obtained from G'' by smoothing any one vertex of degree 2 attains the lower bound for n = 6.

Next, we consider the graph H in Lemma [\ref=lem2]. In [\cite=LLS], We obtained that κ3(H) = 2, n(H) = 5k and e(H) = 6k, for k  ≠  2. So H is exactly the graph of order n = 5k which attains the lower bound.

For k  ≥  3, let k' = k - 1 and then n(H) = 5k' + 5 and e(H) = 6k' + 6. Let X be the set of vertices of degree 2. Clearly |X| = 3k' + 3 > 4, where k'  ≥  2. Now for the graph H, smooth successively any t vertices in X, for 1  ≤  t  ≤  4. For any t, it is easy to check that no parallel edge can arise. Moreover, since |X| > 4, the minimum degree of the resulting graph H' is still 2. Combining Lemma [\ref=lem1] and Remark 2.3, we can get the 3-connectivity of the resulting graph H' is 2. Now let us consider the numbers of vertices and edges of H'.

When t = 1, n(H') = 5k' + 4 and [formula];

When t = 2, n(H') = 5k' + 3 and [formula];

When t = 3, n(H') = 5k' + 2 and [formula];

When t = 4, n(H') = 5k' + 1 and [formula].

Note that k'  ≥  2. Therefore, for all n  ≥  4 but n = 9,10, we can always find a graph of order n attaining the lower bound.
