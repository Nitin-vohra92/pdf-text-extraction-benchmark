Universal quantum state merging

Dedicated to the memory of Rudolf Ahlswede

Introduction

Quantum state merging was introduced by Horodecki, Oppenheim, and Winter [\cite=horodecki05] [\cite=horodecki07b] in order to quantify the amount of partial quantum information contained in bipartite quantum states. I.e. for a bipartite i.i.d. quantum source with generic state ρAB shared by communication parties A ("sender") and B ("receiver"), we want to know how much quantum communication is needed per copy when transferring A's share to B so that source output is completely available to B. A convenient way of measuring quantum communication within this scenario is quantifying the entanglement cost (cf. Ref. [\cite=horodecki07b]): The parties A and B are free to use local operations together with certain exchange of classical messages (LOCC) and moreover they may use preexistent pure entanglement. The protocol performs state merging and produces/returns pure entanglement. The optimal rate for this task was determined in Ref. [\cite=horodecki07b] as the conditional von Neumann entropy S(A|B). In this way, the conditional von Neumann entropy obtains an operational interpretation as the net amount of entanglement resources needed to merge the states. Moreover, the puzzling fact that for some states S(A|B) < 0 can occur can be interpreted naturally within the state merging paradigm: Merging protocols achieving negative rates produce rather than consume entanglement during the process. Additionally, the optimal (i.e. the lowest possible) classical communication rate for a merging procedure achieving quantum rate S(A|B) was determined in Ref. [\cite=horodecki07b] as well. It turned out that I(A;E), the quantum mutual information between the A-part and an environment purifying ρAB is optimal in this case. Another important aspect is that many other protocols can be derived (mostly by reduction) from quantum state merging. Here we just mention some of the examples from [\cite=horodecki07b] like distributed compression, quantum source coding with side information at the decoder, and entanglement generation over quantum multiple access channels. However, these results rely on the assumption of idealized conditions. The authors of Ref. [\cite=horodecki07b] assumed the source to be memoryless and perfectly known. Both of these conditions will hardly be fulfilled in real-life communication settings. In this paper, we drop the second condition and determine the optimal average cost of entanglement per copy under partial ignorance of the state to be merged. We consider a scenario, where statistical properties of the ensemble emitted by the source are not perfectly known to the merging partners. Rather it is assumed, that they only know that the state belongs to a certain set of states. Thus they have to use a protocol which works well for every member of this set. This model can be seen as a source analogue to the notion of compound quantum channels which were considered in Refs.[\cite=bjelakovic08c] and [\cite=bjelakovic09d]. Our main technical result is a generalization of the original one-shot bound given in Ref. [\cite=horodecki07b], which respects state uncertainty. The question of the optimal classical communication cost in this case is addressed as well. The results of this paper gather their relevance from the fact, that other related communication protocols can be obtained by modifying state merging protocols. Our generalization to sets of states can be used to generate protocols which are successful in the corresponding "compound" scenarios. These in turn are stepping stones to tackle the much more involved "arbitrarily varying" models. If one considers, for example, the problem of determining capacities of arbitrarily varying channels, it is well known that good codes for particular compound channels can be transformed in good random codes for arbitrarily varying channels via Ahlswede's robustification technique [\cite=ahlswede80]. The robustification technique can be applied in the quantum case as well. It is exactly this idea that was employed in Ref. [\cite=ahlswede10a] in order to determine the random code capacity for entanglement transmission over arbitrarily varying quantum channels. This in turn can be used to show that either the deterministic classical capacity of the arbitrarily varying quantum channel is zero or the deterministic and random code capacities for entanglement transmission of these channels are equal, a quantum version of Ahlswede's famous dichotomy [\cite=ahlswede78]. We mention this here, because this is up to date the only method allowing us to prove such results. The ingenious and very direct method to prove the coding theorem for classical arbitrarily varying channels developed by Csiszár and Narayan [\cite=csiszar88] does not carry over to the quantum case.

Notations and Conventions

All the Hilbert spaces which appear in this work are assumed to be finite dimensional and over the field of complex numbers. For any two Hilbert spaces H and K, B(H,K) denotes the set of linear operators mapping H to K and B(H) denotes the set of linear operators on H. The set of states (i.e. positive semidefinite operators of trace one) on H is denoted by S(H). With a Hilbert space K, the set of channels (i.e. completely positive (cp) and trace preserving maps) from B(H) to B(K) is denoted by C(H,K), the set of trace non-increasing cp maps by [formula]. With a little abuse of notation, we write [formula] for the identical channel on B(H). Because we mainly deal with systems containing several relevant subsystems, we freely make use of the following convention: An Hilbert space HXYZ is always thought to be the space of a composite system consisting of systems with Hilbert spaces HX, HY and HZ. We use a similar notation for states of composite systems. A state denoted ρXY for instance is a bipartite state with marginals ρX and ρY and so on. Pure states on H are identified with state vectors, e.g. the symbol ψ sometimes denotes the state [formula] and sometimes a state vector ψ∈H corresponding to [formula]. The fidelity is defined by

[formula]

for quantum states ρ and σ on a Hilbert space H. We frequently use the fact that if one of the input states is pure, the fidelity takes the form of an inner product

[formula]

For other properties of the fidelity see Ref. [\cite=jozsa94]. The von Neumann entropy of a state ρ is defined

[formula]

where log (  ·  ) denotes the base two logarithm throughout this work (accordingly exp (  ·  ) is defined to base two as well). For certain other information quantities we choose a notation which indicates the states on which they are evaluated. For a state ρXY on HXY we denote the quantum mutual information by

[formula]

and the conditional von Neumann entropy by

[formula]

For a channel N∈C(H,K) and and a state ρ∈S(H), the coherent information is denoted by

[formula]

where φ is an arbitrary purification of ρ on [formula]. We further denote the hermitian conjugate of an operator a by [formula] and the complex conjugate of a complex number z by [formula]. We use

[formula]

Definitions and main result

Let X  ⊆  S(HAB) be a set of bipartite states with subsystems distributed to (possibly) distant communication partners A and B. An (l,kl)-merging for X is an one-way LOCC channel

[formula]

with local operations on the A- and the B-subscripted spaces and classical A  →  B communication, where KiA≃KiB for i = 0,1 and kl: =  dim K0A  /   dim K1A. A real number R is called an achievable entanglement rate for X, if there exists a sequence of (l,kl)-mergings with

[formula]

[formula] for l  →    ∞  .

where φl0∈S(K0,lAB) and φl1∈S(K1,lAB) are maximally entangled states on their spaces. We demand that the Schmidt ranks of these states do not grow more than exponentially fast for l  →    ∞  , i.e. dim K0,lA, dim K1,lA  ≤  2lC for all [formula] and some constant C > 0. Note that the fraction dim K0,lA  /   dim K1,lA equals, by definition, the fraction of the Schmidt ranks of the input and output entanglement resources φl0 and φl1. Therefore, the expression [formula] corresponds to the number of maximally entangled qubits (ebits) per input copy consumed (or gathered) by the action of Ml. The infimum in the second condition is evaluated over a set Xp which contains a purification ψABE on a space HABE for each ρAB in X. ψB'BE is the state ψABE where the A-part is located on a Hilbert space HB' under B's control. The fidelity measure in [\ref=fidelity_condition].) is independent of the choice of the purifications (which will be shown in the next section). We frequently use the abbreviation

[formula]

for a state ρAB and a merging channel M for ρAB and frequently not specify the space HE explicitly. The maximally entangled input and output states φ0 and φ1 are considered to be determined by M. The optimal entanglement rate Cm(X), i.e.

[formula]

is called the merging cost of X. The main result of this paper is the following theorem, which quantifies the merging cost of any set X of bipartite states.

Let X  ⊂  S(HAB) be a set of states on HAB. Then

[formula]

holds.

To prove the achievability part of the above Theorem [\ref=merging_theorem] we show that we find universal protocols for state merging within the class of LOCC operations which was used by the authors of Ref. [\cite=horodecki07b]. We give a brief outline of our proof of Theorem [\ref=merging_theorem]. In Sect. [\ref=merging_fidelity_props] we state and prove some important facts about the fidelity measure under consideration. We follow this path and recall the decoupling lemma given in Ref. [\cite=horodecki07b] in Sect. [\ref=subsect:protocol]. On this basis we establish a one-shot bound for finite sets of states in Section [\ref=one_shot_finite]. To this end we utilize techniques developed in Refs. [\cite=bjelakovic08c] and [\cite=bjelakovic09d] for proving coding theorems for compound quantum channels. In Sect. [\ref=subsect:finite] we provide the direct part of our merging theorem for finite sets of states and extend these results to arbitrary sets in Sect. [\ref=subsect:general]. The converse theorem easily carries over from the one given in Ref. [\cite=horodecki07b], and we just provide the missing link in Sect. [\ref=subsect:converse].

One-shot result

Properties of the fidelity measure

In this section we aim to prove some important properties of the merging fidelity.

Let [formula] be a channel, φ0∈S(K0AB), and φ1∈S(K1AB) maximally entangled states. Then the following assertions hold

For any state ρAB∈S(HAB) on HAB with purification ψABE∈S(HABE),

[formula]

holds, where p1,...pZ are elements of B(HAB) which depend on M,φ0 and φ1.

Merging fidelity is a convex function of the input state. For any two states ρ1 and ρ2 on HAB and λ∈[0,1]

[formula]

holds.

Let

[formula]

be a Kraus decomposition of M with operators [formula] for every z∈{1,...,Z}. We define channels V and W which incorporate the input and output states φ0 and φ1. Let [formula] be the channel constituted by Kraus operators [formula] defined by

[formula]

for every 1  ≤  z  ≤  Z, x∈HAB and [formula] with

[formula]

for every x∈HAB. Here, U∈B(HA,HB') is the isometry which identifies HA and HB'. With these definitions at hand we have

[formula]

The r.h.s. of ([\ref=merg_fid_sk]) is due to the fact that the fidelity admits a representation in terms of an inner product if one of the inputs is pure, see eq. ([\ref=fidelity_pure]). Each of the summands on the r.h.s. of eq. ([\ref=merg_fid_sk]) can be written as

[formula]

Inserting the r.h.s. of eq. ([\ref=merg_fid_sk_2]) into ([\ref=merg_fid_sk]) yields

[formula]

which is the desired result, if we set [formula] for every z. The second assertion of the lemma is a direct consequence of the first one together with the fact that the fidelity takes only values in

[formula]

Protocol and decoupling for single states

In this section we briefly recall a result given in Ref. [\cite=horodecki07b] which marks the starting point for our investigations. Fortunately, the protocol constructed there, which is of relatively simple structure, can be modified for our purposes. Let dA be the dimension of the Hilbert space HA. For an integer 0  <  L  ≤  dA we use the term L-merging if we speak of a channel

[formula]

which is of the form

[formula]

for every ρ∈S(HAB). Here D is defined [formula] and KA and KB are Hilbert spaces with dim KA  =   dim KB  =  L and KA  ⊆  HA is a subspace of HA, where

{ak}Dk = 0  ⊂  B(HA,KA) is a set of rank L partial isometries (except a0 which has rank dA  -  L  ·  D  <  L) with pairwise orthogonal initial subspaces (in the following, we call such channels L-instrument for short).

[formula] is a family of isometries.

We abbreviate the corresponding operation with [formula] for every k. Let ψABE be a purification of ρAB on a Hilbert space HABE. For notational simplicity we define abbreviations

[formula]

for every k∈{0,...,D}. The following lemma is taken from Ref. [\cite=horodecki07b], we repeat it here including a sketch of the proof which we give for the convenience of the reader.

Let ρAB be a bipartite state on HAB and {ak}Dk = 0  ⊂  B(HA,KA) an L-instrument. There exists a family {uk}Dk = 0 of isometries completing {ak}Dk = 0 to an L-merging M which satisfies

[formula]

where [formula] is defined by

[formula]

Here, the state φL is maximally entangled on KAB and πL denotes the maximally mixed state on KA (i.e. [formula].

In the following proof, the well known relations (see Ref. [\cite=Fuchs2007a])

[formula]

between trace distance and fidelity of any two states ρ and σ on a Hilbert space H are used.

For every k, 0  ≤  k  ≤  D, the (sub-normalized) state [formula] is a purification of ρkAE and [formula] is a purification of [formula]. These facts and Uhlmann's theorem [\cite=uhlmann76] (see Ref. [\cite=jozsa94] for the finite dimensional version) guarantee that for every k∈{0,...,D} there exists an isometry [formula] satisfying

[formula]

where [formula]. The rest is mostly done by lower bounding the fidelity in terms of the trace distance. Given the case that pk  >  0 for k, using ([\ref=fvg_1]) we have

[formula]

In case that pk  =  0 for k, [formula]. Taking the sum over all k we arrive at

[formula]

Eq. ([\ref=uhlmann_absch_1]) follows from the linearity of the fidelity in one of the inputs given the other one is pure and ([\ref=uhlmann_konsequenz]). For ([\ref=uhlmann_absch_2]) we used ([\ref=spurabsch_uhlmann]) along with the fact that [formula] is a channel implying [formula]. The r.h.s. of ([\ref=uhlmann_absch_3]) holds because the trace distance of any two states is upper bounded by 2 which ensures

[formula]

It remains to show that [formula], which can be seen as follows. It holds that

[formula]

where the first inequality is obtained by adding a zero and applying the triangle inequality together with the fact that every quantum state has trace norm one. The second line is by monotonicity of the trace norm under the action of channels.

One shot bound for finite sets of states

In this section we consider a finite set X: = {ρAB,i}Ni = 1 of states on HAB and derive a bound for the minimal merging fidelity of the states in X which is based on Lemma [\ref=lemma:one-shot-single]. The main ingredient for the proof is the observation, that a good merging scheme for the averaged state

[formula]

will be good for every single member of X. This is due to convexity of the merging fidelity (see Lemma [\ref=merg_fid_rep]). Now let ψABE,i be any purification of ρAB,i on HABE for every i∈[N]. The state

[formula]

with {ei}Ni = 1 being an orthonormal basis in [formula] is a purification of [formula] on HABR with [formula]. The following lemma provides a lower bound for the fidelity of an L-merging of [formula] in terms of quantities determined by the states in X.

Let {ρAB,i}Ni = 1 be a set of states on HAB. Then for the corresponding averaged state [formula] and purifications ψABE,1,...,ψABE,N, Lemma [\ref=lemma:one-shot-single] also holds with [formula] replaced by

[formula]

where [formula] and

[formula]

Here we used the definitions

[formula]

for i,j∈[N],k∈[D].

Define

[formula]

for every k∈[D]. We bound the trace distance terms on the r.h.s. of ([\ref=lemma:one-shot-single_1]) for ρAB with its purification introduced in eq. ([\ref=average_purif]). Explicitly, for every k∈[D], we have

[formula]

where [formula] for every 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  N. The above (in)equalities are justified by the following arguments. (a) by definition of [formula] and [formula], (b) by use of the triangle inequality and (c) because the trace norm is multiplicative with respect to tensor products and the equality [formula] for all 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  N. The well known relation [formula] between the trace- and Hilbert-Schmidt norms with r being the rank of x justifies (d), if the rank of the matrix

[formula]

is smaller or equal than Lij for all i,j∈[N]. This is fulfilled, which can be seen as follows. Let with an orthonormal basis {fk}dim HEk = 1 of HE,

[formula]

be a Schmidt decomposition of ψABE,i for every 1  ≤  i  ≤  N, with the Schmidt coefficients incorporated in the first tensor factors. This is always possible since we are free in the choice of the purifications. Using ([\ref=schmidt_coeff_blmatrix]), one can verify, that

[formula]

holds for every i,j∈[N]. This expression can be interpreted as an ri  ×  rj block matrix with each block an L  ×  L matrix. It has therefore rank smaller or equal L  ·   min {ri,rj}.

Let L∈{1,...,dA} be fixed and an arbitrary but fixed L-instrument [formula] be given. Every unitary [formula] defines a channel V∈C(HA) via [formula]. With these definitions, for every v, we get an L-instrument A(v) with

[formula]

Every collection of isometric channels [formula] completes A(v) to an L-merging

[formula]

We define the function

[formula]

for every [formula], ρ∈S(HAB). The maximization in ([\ref=max_fidelity_defined]) is over all collections [formula] of isometric channels.

The expected merging fidelity under random selection of such L-mergings according to the normalized Haar measure on [formula] is bounded in the following lemma, which is the key technical result for the proof of the merging theorem.

For L∈{1,...,dA}, a set {ρAB,i}Ni = 1 of states on HAB and ψABE,i a purification of ρAB,i on HABE for each i, we have

[formula]

where the integration is with respect to the normalized Haar measure on [formula].

To prove the claim of Lemma [\ref=lemma:expectation] the following two lemmas are needed.

Let L and D be N  ×  N-matrices with nonnegative entries such that

[formula]

for all i,j∈{1,...,N}. Then

[formula]

Let τ and ξ be elements of a bipartite Hilbert space [formula]. Then

[formula]

Choose an orthonormal basis {em}dm = 1 in H' where d: =  dim (H'). The elements φ and ψ can be decomposed in the form

[formula]

with suitable elements φ1,...,φd and ψ1,...,ψd in H. With these decompositions

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

To show the assertion of the lemma consider 2 d  ×  d matrices X and Y with entries [formula] resp. [formula] for 0  <  m,n  ≤  d. Then the r.h.s. of ([\ref=matrixlemma_3]) can be read as [formula], and we have

[formula]

where the r.h.s. of ([\ref=cauchy_matrix]) is an application of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. It is easy to see that [formula] and [formula], so we are done.

First we have to convince ourselves, that [formula] depends measurably on [formula]. For each fixed set {Uk}Dk = 0, the function [formula] clearly is continuous in v, therefore, [formula] as a maximum over such functions is lower semicontinous, which implies its measurability. Using Lemma [\ref=lemma:pre_expectation] we get

[formula]

with error

[formula]

Here [formula],

[formula]

and

[formula]

By virtue of Jensen's inequality

[formula]

holds. It remains to bound the expectations in the right hand side of the above inequality. This was already done in Lemma 6 of Ref. [\cite=horodecki07b]. We have

[formula]

Abbreviating [formula] for every i,j∈[N], ([\ref=haar_integrals]) implies

[formula]

The second inequality follows from the fact that the summands on the r.h.s. of ([\ref=fidelitydu_0]) are independent of k and [formula] by definition of D. By definition of Lij, clearly Lij  =   min {Lii,Ljj} for all i,j and so the first assumption of Lemma [\ref=lemma:compound_lemma] is fulfilled. The second assumption (i.e. Dij  ≤   max {Dii,Djj}) holds by Lemma [\ref=lemma:maximum_trace]. Using Lemma [\ref=lemma:compound_lemma], we obtain

[formula]

Note that we replaced [formula] by [formula] for every i, which is admissible, because they are complementary marginals of a pure state [\cite=araki70].

Lemma [\ref=lemma:expectation] provides the desired bound on the worst-case merging fidelity for finite sets. If we choose M to be composed of the L-instrument A(ṽ) for some ṽ which fulfills the bound on the right hand side of ([\ref=lemma:expectation_1]), and {Uk}Dk = 1 which is a maximizer realizing [formula] for ṽ (see eq. ([\ref=max_fidelity_defined])), we have

[formula]

which implies, together with the convexity property of Fm (see Lemma [\ref=merg_fid_rep]),

[formula]

Proof of the merging theorem

Proof of the direct part in case of finite sets of states

In this section we prove the optimal merging rate theorem using our one-shot result from Lemma [\ref=lemma:expectation]. We first consider a finite set X: = {ρAB,i}Ni = 1  ⊂  S(HAB) with purifications ψABE,1,...,ψABE,N∈HABE. For these states we introduce some sort of "typical reductions". We define

[formula]

where [formula],

[formula]

for all [formula] and [formula]. Here li,δ is given by the typical projectors qA,i, qB,i and qE,i of the corresponding marginals of ψABE,i

[formula]

(here and in the following, the indices δ,l,i are sometimes omitted for the sake of brevity). The following lemma provides some bounds needed later

With the definitions given above, we have

wi,δ,l  ≥  1  -  4  ·  2- l(cδ2  -  h(l))

[formula]

[formula]

for all i∈{1,...,N}, [formula] and [formula].

Note, that the functions φ and h in Lemma [\ref=types] depend on the dimensions of the individual Hilbert space, however the above lemma clearly holds if we take the functions φ and h in Lemma [\ref=types] with d =  dim (HABE).

1.) Some simple algebra shows that

[formula]

holds. Therefore

[formula]

2.) We first show, that

[formula]

holds. Note, that

[formula]

Additionally, we have [formula], because

[formula]

where all of the summands on the r.h.s. are nonnegative operators. Therefore

[formula]

which proves eq. ([\ref=types_inequality_1]). The above inequalities rely on the fact, that [formula] and qlB(  ·  )qlB are positive maps, if A is a nonnegative operator. Finally we arrive at

[formula]

where the r.h.s. of eq. ([\ref=types_inequality_3]) follows from ([\ref=types_inequality_1]), and ([\ref=types_inequality_4]) results from Lemma [\ref=types].2 applied twice. The last of the above inequalities follows from Lemma [\ref=types].3 . 3.) follows from the third claim in Lemma [\ref=types] and the fact that S(ρAB,i)  =  S(ρE,i) holds.

For a finite collection X: = {ρAB,i}Ni = 1 of states on HAB, it holds

[formula]

The proof is similar to the corresponding one given in Ref. [\cite=horodecki07b], but uses the one-shot bound given in Lemma [\ref=lemma:expectation]. We show, that the for every ε  >  0, the number max i∈[N]S(A|B;ρAB,i)  +  ε is an achievable rate for a merging of X. First assume, that max i∈[N]S(A|B;ρAB,i)  <  0. Let [formula] such that [formula]. It suffices to consider ε with 0  <  ε  <  | max 1 < i  ≤  NS(A|B,ρAB,i)|. Define

[formula]

According to Lemma [\ref=lemma:expectation] along with Corollary [\ref=corollary1], there is an Ll-merging Ml which fulfills

[formula]

with

[formula]

With help of Lemma [formula] it is easy to bound the summands on the r.h.s. of eq. ([\ref=error_term]). Explicitly it holds

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

holds, where

[formula]

for [formula] and [formula]. The desired bound for the merging fidelity of the original set X of states follows from Winter's gentle measurement Lemma (cf. Ref. [\cite=winter99a], Lemma 9). Explicitly, it holds

[formula]

where [formula]. It remains to consider the case max i∈{1,...,N}S(A|B;ρAB,i)  ≥  0. The above argument can be used with additional assistance of a sufficient amount of entanglement shared by the merging partners. Let φK be a maximally entangled state shared by A and B of Schmidt rank K: = 2⌈ max i∈[N]S(A|B,ρAB,i)⌉  +  1 then for every i the state

[formula]

has negative conditional von Neumann entropy. Therefore the above argument holds for these states giving an Ll-merging [formula] with

[formula]

and [formula] is lower bounded by a function as on the r.h.s. of eq. ([\ref=error_end]). Some unitaries which rearrange the tensor factors do the rest. Because

[formula]

we are done

Proof of the direct part for arbitrary sets of states

In this section we aim to show that the achievability part of Theorem [\ref=merging_theorem] does hold for any arbitrary set X of states as well. This can be achieved by approximating X by a sequence of (finite) nets and using the result obtained in the previous sections. The argument parallels the one given in case of compound quantum channels in Ref. [\cite=bjelakovic09d]. A τ-net in S(H) is a finite set {ρi}Ni = 1 such that for each state ρ on H there is at least one i∈{1,...,N} with [formula]. We find such a finite set for every τ > 0 due to compactness of S(H). For our proof we have to ensure, that we find τ-nets with cardinality upper bounded in an appropriate sense. This is the claim of the next lemma, which is a special case of Lemma 2.6 in Ref. [\cite=mil80].

For any τ∈(0,1] there is a τ-net {ρi}Ni = 1 in S(H) with cardinality

[formula]

The proof is exactly the same as the one given in Ref. [\cite=bjelakovic08c] with the sets and norms replaced by the ones which are treated here.

Let X  ⊆  S(HAB) be an arbitrary set of states on HAB. For a [formula]-net τ, which fulfills the bound given in Lemma [\ref=card_bound], i.e.

[formula]

where dAB: =  dim (HAB), we define the set

[formula]

The following lemma provides some statements concerning τ-nets needed later.

Let X  ⊆  S(HAB) be a set of bipartite states on HAB and Xτ, for [formula], the set defined in ([\ref=approx_net]). It holds

[formula],

For every ρ∈S(HAB) there is a state ρi in Xτ satisfying

[formula]

[formula], and

Let M be any merging operation for states on HAB. Then

[formula]

The first assertion is obvious from the definition of Xτ together with Lemma [\ref=card_bound]. The argument which proves the second one is exactly the same as done in Ref. [\cite=bjelakovic08c] for channels. The third claim is a consequence of Fannes' inequality. Namely, to every positive real number τ we find states ρ' in X and ρi in Xτ such that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Eq. ([\ref=netzabstand]) implies

[formula]

via twofold application of Fannes inequality [\cite=fannes73]. Therefore

[formula]

which proves the assertion. To verify the last claim of the lemma we first fix a purification corresponding to every member of Xτ (remember that we are free in our choice of the purifications). Let ψABE,i be a purification of ρAB,i on HABE for 1  ≤  i  ≤  N. Let ρAB an arbitrary element of X, then we find at least one element of Xτ satisfying

[formula]

As a consequence of Uhlmann's theorem, there exists a purification ψABE of ρAB on HABE such that

[formula]

Now let φ0 and φ1 the maximally entangled input and output states associated with M, then

[formula]

where the last inequality follows from the bound given in eq. ([\ref=fvg_1]). By an application of the triangle inequality, the trace distance on the r.h.s. of eq. ([\ref=tdt]) is upper bounded by

[formula]

By monotonicity of the trace distance under the use of channels and eq. ([\ref=spurnetzbedingung]), each of the two last summands can be upper bounded by [formula], and

[formula]

holds. Eq. ([\ref=fidelity_net_2_1]) is justified by ([\ref=uhlmann_net]) along with the relation given in eq. ([\ref=fvg_2]), and ([\ref=fidelity_net_2_2]) is by the second claim of the present lemma. The first summand is upper bounded by

[formula]

again with eq. ([\ref=fvg_2]) and the assumptions. Eqns. ([\ref=fidelity_net_1]), ([\ref=fidelity_net_2_2]) and ([\ref=fidelity_net_3]) justify

[formula]

Let X  ⊂  S(HAB) be a set of states on HAB. For the merging cost of X it holds

[formula]

We show that

[formula]

is an achievable rate for every ε satisfying 0  <  ε  <  | sup ρ∈XS(A|B,ρ)|. Fix [formula] for the moment and consider the corresponding set Xτ given in ([\ref=approx_net]) which approximates X. According to the proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem:finite_ach] we find, for l large enough, an (l,kl)-merging with

[formula]

where the second inequality is from Lemma [\ref=net_lemma]. Another consequence of Lemma [\ref=net_lemma] is the inequality

[formula]

If we now choose a sequence [formula] such that lim l  →    ∞τl  =  0 and [formula] hold, and additionally Nτl is growing polynomially (which is possible because Lemma [\ref=card_bound] holds), then ([\ref=net_ende_1]) and ([\ref=net_ende_2]) show that sup ρ∈XS(A|B,ρ)  +  ε is achievable.

Proof of the converse part

Because we have shown that any rate above the least upper bound of the entanglement costs of the members of X achievable, our converse follows immediately from the original converse for single states from Ref. [\cite=horodecki07b]. The argument given there is based on the fact that entanglement measures must be monotone under LOCC operations along with an application of Fannes' inequality. As the proof is carried out in detail there, we just extend the argument to our present case. Let δ  >  0 and χAB a member of X which satisfies

[formula]

Following the argument of the single state converse, we arrive at

[formula]

with a function g which is O(1) for l  →    ∞  . Therefore the entanglement cost of X is least sup ρ∈XS(A|B,ρ)  -  δ for every δ  >  0.

Classical communication cost of state merging

Having determined the optimal entanglement cost of a state merging process, we consider the classical cost of state merging in this section. By classical cost, we mean the rate of classical communication from A to B, which is at least required for an asymptotically perfect merging process. More precisely, if {Ml}∞l = 1 is a sequence of A  →  B one-way LOCCs for a set X, where A distinguishes a number of Dl measurement outcomes (see Section [\ref=sect:definitions], eq. ([\ref=locc_allg])) within the application of Ml, the classical cost is given by

[formula]

In case of a single state ρAB, the minimum rate of classical communication for merging protocols achieving entanglement rate Rq  =  S(A|B,ρAB) was determined in Ref. [\cite=horodecki07b] as Rc  =  I(A;E,ρAE), where ρAE is the marginal on the subsystems belonging to A and E of an arbitrary purification ψABE of ρAB. In this section we deal with the case of a set of states to be merged and for the sake of simplicity, we restrict ourselves to finite sets of states. Clearly, the classical communication cost of a merging procedure for a set X of states is lower bounded by the maximum of the communication costs for the individual states in X. This is a direct consequence of the known result for single states, which was given in Ref. [\cite=horodecki07b]. The original proof given there is based on properties of the closely related "mother protocol" [\cite=abeyesinghe09] and general assertions within the resource framework from Ref. [\cite=devetak08]. Here, we give a more elementary proof for the reader not familiar with the results of Refs. [\cite=devetak08] and [\cite=abeyesinghe09]. Moreover, this result and a converse statement for the case that A and B are restricted to L-mergings show, that the protocol class we considered to show achievability of the merging cost, is suboptimal regarding the classical cost.

Let ρAB∈S(HAB) be a bipartite state with purification ψABE on a space HABE and ε∈(0,1). If [formula] is an A  →  B one-way LOCC such that

[formula]

holds with maximally entangled states φK,φL of Schmidt rank K resp. L, then

[formula]

holds, where the function η is defined on

[formula]

The proof is inspired by ideas from Ref. [\cite=groisman05]. Fix ε∈(0,1) and [formula]. Let φK∈K0AB and φL∈K1AB maximally entangled input resp. output states of the protocol such that with notations

[formula]

eq. ([\ref=single_class_converse_error]) reads

[formula]

We use the abbreviations [formula], [formula] for k∈[D], and T  =  {k∈[D]:pk  ≠  0}. It is well known, that the von Neumann entropy is an almost convex function, i.e. for a state [formula] defined as a mixture [formula] of quantum states,

[formula]

holds, where H(p1,...,pN) is the Shannon entropy of the probability distribution on

[formula]

It is worth noting here, that the lower bound for the classical cost established in the proof of Proposition [\ref=single_class_converse] does not explicitly rely on the entanglement rate of the protocol. Consequently, there is no chance to significantly reduce the required classical communication by admitting a higher entanglement rate, as long as one demands the protocol to be asymptotically perfect.

In contrast to the above result, the following lemma indicates the limitations of the class of protocols used for establishing the achievability of the merging cost.

Let {ρAB,i}Ni = 1 be a set of states on HAB. For every ε∈(0,1) and δ  >  0, there exists a number l0(ε,δ), such that if l  >  l0 and [formula] is an L-merging for states on [formula] for some [formula] with

[formula]

then

[formula]

holds.

First we consider for an arbitrary but fixed number [formula] and an arbitrary single state ρAB. Let M  ⊂  [D] be a set of indices which fulfills

[formula]

We use abbreviations

[formula]

Without any loss we assume that M contains no index k with [formula]. Because we are concerned with an L-merging for ψ0 here, we have

[formula]

for every k in M where {pk}k∈M is a set of mutually orthogonal projections of rank L. We have

[formula]

and

[formula]

where we used the definition [formula]. It holds

[formula]

Here, ([\ref=single_class_lmerging_mon]) follows from the monotonicity of the fidelity under partial traces, ([\ref=single_class_lmerging_hom]) by the fact that it is homogeneous in its inputs. The last equality is by ([\ref=single_class_lmerging_last]). We may w.l.o.g. assume, that ρ0 is of the form [formula] with some maximally entangled state φ0, otherwise one could add a maximally entangled system to achieve this. In this case, Eq. ([\ref=single_class_lmerging_hom_2]) would hold with the projector [formula] instead of q, and this can be done without changing in the asymptotic rates. The well known fact, that subspaces of large probability, asymptotically, cannot have dimension substantially smaller than the typical subspace (see Ref. [\cite=csiszar11], Lemma 2.14) guarantees

[formula]

if l is sufficiently large. If we take into account, that q is a sum of |M| mutually orthogonal projections of rank L (i.e. [formula]), we have

[formula]

If we now consider a set X: = {ρAB,i}Ni = 1 and and repeat the above argument with sets M1,...,MN for this case we arrive at

[formula]

which concludes our proof.

Let X: = {ρAB,i}Ni = 1 be a set of bipartite states on HAB and δ  >  0. For a merging procedure, where A and B are restricted to L-mergings (together with adding some further input pure entanglement) and entanglement rate

[formula]

is achieved, the optimal rate of classical communication is

[formula]

The converse statement follows directly from Lemma [\ref=l_merging_class_converse]. If {Ml}∞l = 1 is a merging which fulfills the assumptions of the Theorem, then

[formula]

with maximally entangled states φKl resp. φLl of Schmidt ranks for Kl an Ll for every i∈[N], [formula], and

[formula]

hold. With ([\ref=l_merging_class_rate]) and Lemma [\ref=l_merging_class_converse] it follows

[formula]

To prove achievability, we step back to Section [\ref=subsect:protocol]. Because A and B are using an Ll-merging for every l, the distinct number of measurement results A has to communicate to B is given by

[formula]

The argument in Section [\ref=subsect:protocol] shows, that the desired quantum rate can be achieved by choosing L-mergings for the mixtures

[formula]

where lAB,i is the [formula]-typically reduced state for [formula] for every [formula] some [formula]. We can therefore assume [formula] to be restricted to the support of lA. Clearly, it holds

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

and

[formula]

if l is large enough.

The converse statement in the preceding Theorem is more strict than the one given in Prop. [\ref=single_class_converse]. The following example shows, that there are sets X, where the optimal classical cost is surely not achieved by using L-mergings. However, here we achieve the desired classical rate just by simple modifications of the protocol.

Consider the set {ρAB,1,ρAB,2}  ⊂  S(HAB) consisting of two members ρAB,1  =  φL and [formula], where φL is a maximally entangled state of Schmidt rank L on a subspace of HAB and πM is the maximally mixed state. We assume, that L > M and

[formula]

holds. In this case, we have

[formula]

Since the supports of the A-marginals are orthogonal, A can perfectly distinguish his parts of the states (using one copy) and therefore get state knowledge. The rest is done by tracing out remaining entanglement to make both mergings have the same entanglement cost.

Appendix: LOCC Channels

In this section, we give a short account to the class of one-way LOCC channels which we use in our considerations. For further information, we recommend the survey article by Keyl [\cite=keyl02] (and references therein). A more recent general treatment can be found in Ref. [\cite=chitambar12]. Crucial for the definition of LOCC channels is the concept of an instrument. Instruments (or operation valued measures[\cite=davies70]) were introduced to model the situation, where a measurement is made, and not only the measurement results but also the state transformations according to the measurement values are taken into account. To each measurement result i, there is assigned a positive trace non-increasing cp map Ii which transforms the input state. In this paper, we restrict ourselves to finite sets of possible measurement results.

A (finite) instrument A is a map

[formula]

with a finite index set I and Hilbert spaces H, K, such that [formula] is trace preserving. The instrument A is completely determined by the family {Ai}i∈I. We will sometimes write A  =  {Ai}i∈I to denote the instrument A.

For bipartite systems, an instrument at, say, A's (the sender's) site can be combined with a parameter-dependent channel use, which is defined by a function

[formula]

i.e. each Bi is a completely positive and trace preserving map. A one-way LOCC channel is then defined as a combination of an instrument and a parameter-dependent channel. This leads to the following definition.

A channel N∈C(HAB,KAB) is called A  →  B one-way LOCC channel, if it takes the form

[formula]

where A  =  {Ai}i∈I, [formula], is an instrument and {Bi}i∈I is a parameter-dependent channel.

A one-way LOCC can also again be considered as a "one-way local" instrument[\cite=chitambar12] with members [formula]. There is a convenient way of handling one-way LOCCs. One can equivalently write the instrument A used on A's site in channel form

[formula]

with an orthonormal basis [formula]. If the basis is assigned to a system on B's site (which models a classical communication and coherent storage of the measurement results at the receiver's system), the parameter-dependent channel can be written in the form

[formula]

(this map may not not be trace-preserving). Then we have for ρ∈S(HAB)

[formula]

where the second line includes a permutation of the tensor factors. Tracing out the classical information exchanged within the application of the map (i.e. the system with space [formula]) leads back to the form given in Eq. ([\ref=app_locc_one_def]). The more general class of two-way LOCC channels exhibits a more intricate definition for which we refer to Refs. [\cite=keyl02], [\cite=chitambar12]. Moreover, Def. [\ref=def_app_locc_one_def] should not be confused with the definition of the class of separable channels. A channel M∈C(HAB,KAB) is called separable, if it takes the form

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] for all i∈I. From eqns. ([\ref=app_locc_one_def]) and ([\ref=app_sep_def]), the difference between the one-way LOCC and separable channels can be observed. While separable channels allow general trace decreasing cp maps for both parties, the receiver party is restricted to usage of trace preserving cp maps (i.e. channels) in the one-way LOCC class of channels.
