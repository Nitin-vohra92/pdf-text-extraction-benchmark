On a construction of A. Lucchini

Keywords: Group theory; profinite groups; just infinite groups

Lucchini's construction predates a paper by J. Wilson ([\cite=Wil]) on 'large' hereditarily just infinite groups. In particular, Lucchini's group turns out to be an early example of the groups asserted to exist in Theorem A of [\cite=Wil]. We will give the proof as a series of lemmas.

Say a profinite group G is of Lucchini type if it is the inverse limit of a sequence of finite groups as follows:

G1 is any finite group. Thereafter [formula] (with the natural surjection Gi + 1  →  Gi), such that:

Ωi is a free (but not necessarily transitive) Gi-set;

Ai is a non-abelian finite simple group;

every finite group appears as a subgroup of Ai for infinitely many i.

Given G of this form, write Ti for the base group of [formula].

Let G be the profinite group constructed in [\cite=Luc]. Then G is of Lucchini type.

Lucchini's group is constructed as the inverse limit of the sequence [formula], where [formula]. For each i  ≥  1, one first takes the group [formula] where the wreathing action is regular and [formula]. Note that |Xi|  ≥  5 so Ai is a non-abelian simple group. Write Si for the base group of [formula]. Then Xi + 1 is constructed as a subdirect power of [formula]:

[formula]

(The value of ti is not important for the present discussion.)

Note that Xi + 1 can be regarded as an intransitive wreath product [formula], where Ωi is an Xi-set consisting of ti free orbits of Xi. Finally, since |Xi|  →    ∞   it is clear that any finite group appears as a subgroup of [formula] for all but finitely many i. Thus G is of Lucchini type as required.

From now on, G will be a group of Lucchini type, with finite groups as in Definition [\ref=typdef], and homomorphisms πi:G  →  Gi arising from the inverse limit.

G has a descending chain [formula] of open normal subgroups with trivial intersection, such that each Ni is of Lucchini type.

Let Gi be a sequence of finite groups of the prescribed form, and let πi:G  →  Gi be the homomorphism arising from the inverse limit. Let Nj  =   ker πj. Clearly [formula] is a descending chain of open normal subgroups with trivial intersection. Fix j and set Hi  =  πi + j(Nj). Then for all i  ≥  1, [formula]. Moreover Hi  ≤  Gi + j, so Hi acts freely on Ωi + j. The condition on the set of groups {Ai|i  ≥  1} is clearly inherited by the set {Ai + j|i  ≥  1}. Hence Nj is of Lucchini type.

All groups of Lucchini type are hereditarily just infinite.

Let G be a group of Lucchini type. By Lemma [\ref=hered] it suffices to show that G is just infinite. Let N be a non-trivial closed normal subgroup of G. Then there exists j such that for all i  ≥  j, πi(N) is non-trivial. In this case πi(N) acts freely and non-trivially on Ωi, so that πi(N) regarded as a subgroup of [formula] does not centralise any of the simple factors of Ti. It follows that   =  Ti, so πi + 1(N)  ≥  Ti. As this applies for all i  ≥  j, in fact N  ≥   ker πj, so N is an open subgroup of G.

Let G be a group of Lucchini type. Then every countably based profinite group can be embedded into G as a closed subgroup.

Let H be a countably based profinite group. Then H is the inverse limit of a countable collection [formula] of finite groups, and so H is isomorphic to a closed subgroup of [formula]. Furthermore, [formula] is isomorphic to a closed subgroup of [formula]: choose i1 such that H1 embeds in Ai1, then i2  >  i1 such that H2 embeds in Ai2, and so on. Finally, [formula] appears naturally as a closed subgroup of G: take Ai to be the diagonal subgroup of the direct power Ti, and note that these copies of Ai all appear as subgroups of G such that = 1 for all [formula].
