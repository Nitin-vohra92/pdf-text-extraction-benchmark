Introduction

Let [formula] be a sequence of positive integers with k1 > 1, the weight [formula], depth [formula] and height [formula] are defined by

[formula]

respectively. For such a sequence [formula], there are two well studied real numbers: multiple zeta value [formula] defined by

[formula]

and multiple zeta-star value [formula] defined by

[formula]

We call the values [formula] and [formula] with weight [formula], depth [formula] and height [formula].

The well-known Ohno-Zagier relation ([\cite=ohno-zagier]) is a class of relations about the sums of multiple zeta values of fixed weight, depth and height. For integers k,n,s with [formula] and [formula], we denote by X0(k,n,s) the sum of all multiple zeta values of weight k, depth n and height s. The Ohno-Zagier relation says that

[formula]

More explicitly, Ohno and Zagier gave the generating function expression

[formula]

where α and β are determined by α  +  β = u + v and αβ = t. In [\cite=li2010], we showed that the Ohno-Zagier relation can be deduced from the regularized double shuffle relation. In [\cite=li2008], we generalized the concept height to i-height, studied sums of multiple zeta values of fixed weight, depth and general height, and expressed a kind of generating function of these sums in terms of generalized hypergeometric functions.

Similarly, we denote by [formula] the sum of all multiple zeta-star values of weight k, depth n and height s for integers k,n,s with [formula] and [formula]. The authors of [\cite=aoki-kombu-ohno] considered a generating function [formula] of sums [formula], where

[formula]

It was proved in [\cite=aoki-kombu-ohno] that [formula] can be expressed by a special value of the generalized hypergeometric function   3F2 as

[formula]

where α,β are determined by α  +  β = u + v,αβ = uv - t2, and the generalized hypergeometric function   3F2 is defined as (see [\cite=bailey])

[formula]

with the Pochhammer symbol (a)n given by

[formula]

Similarly to [\cite=li2008], the authors of [\cite=aoki-ohno-wakabayashi] considered a kind of generating function of sums of multiple zeta-star values of fixed weight, depth and general height, and represented this generating function via generalized hypergeometric functions.

Since the generating function [formula] is represented by   3F2 as in [\eqref=Eq:3f2], it is expected that in general [formula] can't be written as a polynomial of zeta values with rational coefficients. While in [\cite=kaneko-ohno] Kaneko and Ohno considered some kind of duality of multiple zeta-star values, and proposed the following conjecture.

For any positive integers m,n,s with [formula], we have

[formula]

It was proved in [\cite=kaneko-ohno] that the conjecture is true for s = 1. Using the result of [\cite=aoki-kombu-ohno] about the generating function [formula], Yamazaki gave another proof of this case in [\cite=yamazaki]. Note that the Kaneko-Ohno theorem for their conjecture in the case s = 1 can be restated as

[formula]

The purpose of this paper is to give a proof of Kaneko-Ohno Conjecture. In fact, similarly to [\eqref=Eq:height-one], we give an expression of [formula] by gamma functions in Theorem [\ref=Thm:main_theorem]. Our proof is based on the expression of [formula] given in [\cite=aoki-kombu-ohno], and hence is similar to the one of Yamazaki given in [\cite=yamazaki] for the special case s = 1.

In Section 2, we state our main result and give some corollaries. In Section 3, we prepare a result about generalized hypergeometric series   3F2. In the last section, we give the proof of the main theorem.

Statement of the main result

Main theorem

As in Section 1, we denote by [formula] the sum of all multiple zeta-star values of weight k, depth n and height s for integers k,n,s with [formula] and [formula]. Let [formula] be the generating function defined by

[formula]

For variables u,v,t, we define a and b by the conditions a + b =  - u + v and ab =  - uv - t2. Equivalently, we have

[formula]

After that we define the function A(u,v,a,b) by

[formula]

Note that A(u,v,a,b) = A(u,v,b,a), which shall play an important role in the proof of our main theorem. We can express A(u,v,a,b) by gamma functions as in the following lemma.

We have

[formula]

and

[formula]

Proof.  Equation [\eqref=Eq:equi-A-b] follows from equation [\eqref=Eq:equi-A-a] and the fact A(u,v,a,b) = A(u,v,b,a). Using the well-known reflection formula

[formula]

we find that the right-hand side of equation [\eqref=Eq:equi-A-a] becomes

[formula]

which is equal to

[formula]

Now it is easy to finish the proof.

The main theorem of this paper is the following theorem.

We have

[formula]

Some remarks

By the definition of the generating function [formula], it is easy to see that

[formula]

Since we have the expansion

[formula]

where γ is the Euler's constant, we know that Theorem [\ref=Thm:main_theorem] indeed implies Kaneko-Ohno Conjecture.

For any positive integers m,n,s with [formula], the difference

[formula]

can be expressed as a polynomial of zeta values with rational coefficients.

Pay attention to the second term of the right-hand side of equation [\eqref=Eq:difference], we have another corollary.

For any positive integers k,s with [formula], the sum [formula] can be expressed as a polynomial of zeta values with rational coefficients.

Note that the above corollary is an immediate consequence of the symmetric sum formula for multiple zeta-star values (see [\cite=hoffman]).

Let t = 0 in Theorem [\ref=Thm:main_theorem], we can get equation [\eqref=Eq:height-one]. In fact, in this case, we can assume that a =  - u and b = v. For A(u,v,a,b), we use the equivalent equation [\eqref=Eq:equi-A-a]. Then using Theorem [\ref=Thm:main_theorem], we really get equation [\eqref=Eq:height-one].

A result about generalized hypergeometric series   3F2

To prove the main theorem of this paper, we introduce the following result.

Let [formula] with their real parts sufficient small. We have

[formula]

where ψ(x) = Γ'(x) / Γ(x) is the digamma function.

To save space, from now on we will denote the special value [formula] by [formula].

To prove the above proposition, we need two transformation formulas. The first one is (see [\cite=bailey])

[formula]

provided that [formula] and [formula]. The second one is (see [\cite=bailey])

[formula]

provided that [formula] and [formula].

Proof of Proposition [\ref=Prop:keyProp]. Taking a parameter ε, such that |ε| is sufficient small, we have

[formula]

Now we consider the series [formula]. Applying [\eqref=Eq:trans-to-two], we get

[formula]

To the first   3F2-series in the right-hand side of [\eqref=Eq:in-proofProp-1], we apply the Gaussian summation formula (see [\cite=bailey])

[formula]

for [formula], and apply [\eqref=Eq:trans-to-one] to the second   3F2-series in the right-hand side of [\eqref=Eq:in-proofProp-1], we obtain

[formula]

To the   3F2-series in the right-hand side of the above equation, we split it into two terms as [formula]. Then we see that [formula] is equal to

[formula]

Finally, let ε go to 0 to finish the proof. For the first two lines of the above expression, we use L'Hôpital's rule and the fact that ψ(1) =  - γ.

Proof of the main theorem

In this section, we prove Theorem [\ref=Thm:main_theorem].

Using the result of Aoki-Kombu-Ohno ([\cite=aoki-kombu-ohno]) for the generating function [formula], we have the following lemma.

Let α and β be determined by α  +  β = u + v and αβ = uv - t2. We have

[formula]

Proof.  The result of Aoki-Kombu-Ohno in [\cite=aoki-kombu-ohno] gives that

[formula]

Here [formula] is the Gaussian hypergeometric function given by

[formula]

Hence we have

[formula]

Now it is easy to finish the proof.

Recall that we have defined a and b by

[formula]

Using the above lemma, we immediately get the following result.

We have

[formula]

where F(u,v,a,b) is defined by

[formula]

Since we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

we get

[formula]

In the above, we have used Gaussian summation formula for Gaussian hypergeometric function at unit argument. Similarly, we have

[formula]

Hence we get the following lemma.

We have

[formula]

where F1(u,v,a,b) is defined by

[formula]

and F2(u,v,a,b) is defined by

[formula]

Now we begin to compute F1(u,v,a,b) + F1(u,v,b,a) and F2(u,v,a,b) + F2(u,v,b,a). For F1(u,v,a,b) + F1(u,v,b,a), we have the following result.

The sum F1(u,v,a,b) + F1(u,v,b,a) equals

[formula]

Proof.  Using the reflection formula for gamma function, we see that F1(u,v,a,b) + F1(u,v,b,a) is equal to

[formula]

The term in the brace of the above expression is

[formula]

Picking up the common factors, and noting the identities

[formula]

we see that the expression [\eqref=Eq:lem-to-F1] becomes

[formula]

which finishes the proof.

For F2(u,v,a,b) + F2(u,v,b,a), we apply Proposition [\ref=Prop:keyProp] to get the following result.

The sum F2(u,v,a,b) + F2(u,v,b,a) equals

[formula]

Proof.  Applying Proposition [\ref=Prop:keyProp] to the   3F2-series in F2(u,v,a,b), we find that F2(u,v,a,b) becomes

[formula]

which is just

[formula]

Hence using the fact A(u,v,a,b) = A(u,v,b,a), we find F2(u,v,a,b) + F2(u,v,b,a) becomes

[formula]

It is easy to see that

[formula]

which equals

[formula]

by Gaussian summation formula. Applying the formulas

[formula]

and

[formula]

we finish the proof.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=Thm:main_theorem]. Theorem [\ref=Thm:main_theorem] follows from Lemma [\ref=Lem:F], Lemma [\ref=Lem:F-F1-F2], Lemma [\ref=Lem:F1Duality] and Lemma [\ref=Lem:F2Duality].
