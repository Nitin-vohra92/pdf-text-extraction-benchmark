Unimodality of f-vectors of cyclic polytopes

The face vectors of convex polytopes were conjectured to be unimodal, that is, it was conjectured for every d-polytope P that there exists some j such that

[formula]

where fk is the number of k-dimensional faces of the polytope for - 1  ≤  k  ≤  d - 1. This conjecture was disproved even for simplicial polytopes (see e.g. Björner [\cite=bjo]) and even in low dimensions. For a brief historical overview of this topic, see Ziegler [\cite=zieg]. However, the conjecture holds for certain polytopes with some restrictions on dimension (see e.g. Werner [\cite=wer]). Unimodality may also hold for some families of convex polytopes in any dimension. For example the face vector of the d-simplex is clearly unimodal for any d.

Ziegler posed the question in [\cite=zie] and also in [\cite=zieg], whether the unimodal conjecture holds generally for cyclic polytopes. A partial answer was given by Schmitt [\cite=sch] who showed that the f-vector of a cyclic d-polytope is unimodal if the number of its vertices is sufficiently large compared to d. The unimodality is also tested for cyclic polytopes with less than 1000 vertices ([\cite=sch] Section 2.3). The remaining range of the number of vertices is covered by the theorem of the present note.

In fact, we prove a stronger statement, namely, the log-concavity of cyclic polytopes, which implies the unimodality. The sequence [formula] is called log-concave if fi - 1fi + 1  ≤  f2i for all - 1 < i < d.

The Upper Bound Theorem (proved by McMullen [\cite=mcm]) provides an upper bound for the f-vectors of convex polytopes. This upper bound is attained by the cyclic polytopes. The cyclic polytope C(v,d) is the convex hull of any v points on the moment curve [formula] in [formula]. The combinatorial type of C(v,d) is uniquely determined by v and d, therefore its f-vector depends only on v and d. For the sake of simplicity, let us restrict our attention to even dimensional cyclic polytopes, the odd dimensional case can be dealt with in a similar way, but with the uncomfortable presence of the floor function.

The h-vector of C(v,d) is defined as follows (see e.g. Grünbaum [\cite=grun])

[formula]

and for [formula] we have hj(C(v,d)) = hd - j(C(v,d)) from the Dehn-Sommerville equations. The relation between the h-vector and f-vector is given by the following equations

[formula]

Stanley [\cite=sta] formulated the above relation graphically by constructing an integer array, which contains the f-vector and h-vector of a simplicial polytope. We construct here a similar "Pascal type triangle" to illustrate the main idea of the present note. Let C(v,d) be a cyclic polytope with the h-vector [formula]. Let 0  ≤  k  ≤  d. We introduce the following notation

[formula]

In addition, we agree that [formula] for 0  ≤  k  ≤  d - 1 and [formula] Furthermore, let [formula] if j > k or j <  - 1. Using this notation, we have [formula] for the f-vector of C(v,d). Using Pascal's rule related to the binomial coefficients we have the recursion

[formula]

This recursion allows us to construct a Pascal type triangle such that [formula] will be the jth element of the kth row. The dth row of this triangle is the f-vector of the polytope C(v,d).

The f-vectors of cyclic polytopes are log-concave.

Using the notation [\ref=eqq], we have to show that the following sequence is log-concave

[formula]

Let P(k) denote the vector [formula]. We shall say that [formula] is a dip of P(k) if [formula] for some 0  ≤  j  ≤  k - 1. It is sufficient to show that P(d) has no dips. If [formula], then P(k) is a prefix of a certain row of the Pascal's triangle, therefore P(k) is log-concave (see e.g. Comtet [\cite=com]), that is, it has no dips. Now, let us assume that [formula] and P(k) has at least one dip but P(k - 1) has no dips. If [formula] is a dip of P(k), then one can distinguish two different cases:

If 0 < l < k - 1, then we temporarily use the following notation for the sake of simplicity:

[formula]

Since P(k - 1) has no dips, b2  ≥  ac and c2  ≥  bd. On the other hand [formula] is a dip of P(k), thus we have (b + c)2 < (a + b)  ·  (c + d) by the recursion [\ref=eqq1]. Consequently, b2 + c2 + bc < ac + ad + bd, therefore bc < ad, which is contradiction, because b2  ≥  ac and c2  ≥  bd imply that [formula] and [formula], that is, ad  ≤  bc.

In the second case let l = 0 or l = k - 1. If l = k - 1, then we use the following notation

[formula]

Since P(k - 1) has no dips, b2  ≥  ac. On the other hand [formula] is a dip of P(k), thus we have (b + c)2 < (a + b)  ·  d by the recursion [\ref=eqq1]. In addition, we know that c  ≥  d, therefore b2 + bc + c2 < ac, which is contradiction, because b2  ≥  ac. The case l = 0 similarly leads to a contradiction, therefore the fact that P(k) has a dip implies that P(k - 1) has a dip too.

Now, let us assume that the vector P(d) has a dip. Using the above observation recursively, one can show that the vector [formula] has a dip, which is not possible.

The odd dimensional case can be proved by applying the same method.
