Re-calibration of sample means.

and Y. Ritov

Introduction

The purpose of this note is to examine the popular calibration techniques, suggested, e.g., in Deville and Sarndal (1992), or Sarndal et.al. (1992) Chapter 6.4, those calibrated estimators are also known as GREG (the general regression estimator). Our development and criterion are elementary. We are interested in finding a minimum variance linear estimator.This leads lead to a very similar to the GREG estimator in form estimator, but with different constants. The difference between these two approaches as demonstrated in what follows. This demonstration is the main purpose of this note.

First we review the above mentioned calibration GREG approach, following Deville and Sarndal (1992). Consider a finite population U = {1,...,N}, and a sample S, S  ⊂  U. Denote πi  =  P(S∋i), πij = P(S  ⊇  {i,j}). Let (yi,i), be quantities associtaed with item i, i∈U, here yi is a scalar and i is a vector. The quantity of interest is [formula], while i are considered as covariates. Suppose the total [formula] is known, w.l.o.g., [formula]. Then, it is suggested to utilize that information about the totals through the following reasoning.

Define [formula] and [formula], where di = 1 / πi. The above are the Horowitz-Thompson estimators, hence we have Ey = tY and [formula]. However, the value of X is typically different than 0, which is unfortunate.

It is suggested to find "better" or "improved" weights wi,  i∈S ("better" than di) and estimate ty by [formula]. The heuristic derivation of the improved (random) weights wi,  i∈S is the following. Given S denote by [formula] the vector of improved weights. Then [formula] is defined as the solution of the program:

[formula]

here, the qi are selected parameters, which, as a default, suggested to be set to 1. The resulting estimator denoted [formula], may be written as: [formula].

The solution of [\eqref=prog] is simple. Using a vector of Lagrange multipliers λ we can find that

[formula]

where λ is such that the constraint is satisfied, namely

[formula]

where [formula]. Hence

[formula]

where [formula].

In the following we consider weights [formula], and denote then Hq simply by H.

Note that for any (pre-determined) [formula], [formula] is an unbiased estimator of tY. Hence we may look for the minimal variance estimator of this type. One may restrict himself to a linear estimator (linear in Yi, i∈S). That is, an estimator of the form [formula], with a sequence of weight that could simultaneously be used for getting an estimator for any functional. Still one may look for such weights that would ensure that the estimator has a minimal variance. We will argue that the weights given by [\eqref=prog] are generally speaking, far from being optimal.

Similar problem were discussed in Bickel, Klaassen, Ritov, and Wellenr (1998) in the context of observations and semiparametric models. The question there, was defined as the semiparametric efficient estimation of parameter, when other parameters are known (e.g., estimation of the joint distribution, when the marginal distributions are known). Our solution is similar to the examples analyzed in that literature.

Minimum variance linear unbiased estimator

Consider estimators of tY which are linear in Y and X, i.e., of the form

[formula]

where [formula] is non-random. The above class is unbiased since EX = 0. Consider the estimator [formula] in the above class with minimal variance. Clearly,

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] are the variance-covariance matrix of X, and the covariance vector of X and Y, respectively.

First we argue that [formula] is not a consistent estimator of [formula]. The following example, while being extreme, is enlightening.

Consider a population divided into two stratas of equal sizes. For each i∈U there is a corresponding yi and xi, i.e., we have one dimensional covariates. Suppose we randomly sample n units from each strata, i.e., a total of M = 2n where [formula].

Assume the mean of xi in stratum 1 is -1 and their mean in stratum 2 is 1. The variance of xi within each stratum is σ2. Now assume in stratum 1, [formula], while in stratum 2, [formula]. Therefore, [formula], and hence [formula]. In fact, the optimal estimator in this case is simply [formula], on the other hand, [formula]. Asymptotically (as [formula] ) the GREG estimator [formula] has therefor variance of order N2 / n, while the optimal estimator for this case is exact with zero variance.

The difference between [formula] and [formula] would be large, when there is more than a scale difference between the second moments of Y,X and of those of Y,X. This precludes the simple random sample, but is typical for other sampling scheme. The following example is less extreme than the first one, but describes a practical situation.

Suppose we sample clusters, the units in the sample are indexed by j and k, where all units in cluster j, refer to the same central value sj, and satisfy [formula] and yjk = sj  +  γνjk, where the correlation between [formula] and νjk is 0. Suppose that K units are sampled in each cluster. It is clear that if the number of clusters is large, then with obvious notation: [formula] while [formula]. In the simple case where [formula], if K = 5 then the estimator with β0 would have a variance smaller by approximately 25% than the variance of the estimator using [formula]. The difference is approximately 50% when K = 10.

In order to estimate the ΣX and ΣY,X, we may use the classical variance estimators for Horovitz-Thompson estimator, see, e.g., Cochran (1977) or Sharon (1999). Those estimators are typically given in the literature for one dimensional variance rather than to a covariance matrix, however the same reasoning applies. Since [formula],

[formula]

Similarly,

[formula]

Hence, the following are unbiased estimators:

[formula]

We assume that we consider a sequence of populations and designs such that the estimators in [\eqref=unbiased] are consistent. Typically, taking c = 1 in [\eqref=unbiased], would suffice to make most of the terms of lower order than the diagonal. In a simple random sample without replacement, c = (n - 1)N / n(N - 1) leaves only the diagonal.

Let o  =  - 1XY,X, where the terms in the RHS are given by [\eqref=unbiased] with a given c. Then

[formula]

where

[formula]

Thus the weights are a function of [formula], πi, πij, i,j∈S only. In particular [formula].

Examining [formula] under linear model assumptions.

In this section we will examine the rational in the estimator [formula] under the convenient and (too) often assumed super-population model under which [formula], where Eεk = 0 and for simplicity assume that εk, k∈U have equal variance.

Under this model it is easy to check that [formula], and [formula]. Hence [formula] is a possible estimator of [formula]. However, if this model is assumed, it is still not clear why [formula] should be used. We have here a standard regression problem. Elementary regression theory (namely the Gauss-Markov Theorem) implies that the optimal estimator is not [formula], but the standard un-weighted linear regression of [formula] on [formula].

It might be argued that in fact we are taking the linear model super-population assumption with a grain of salt, and thus we are using the estimator for

[formula]

which is defined under no linear model assumptions. However, since in this case we have no interest in that population parameter per se, but just in a tool for construction a good estimator for tY, than [formula] should be our target.

To summarize. If we are interested in the super-population parameter, than [formula] is not efficient, and if we are interested in good estimator of tY, than [formula] is not consistent under complex sampling schemes.

A partial knowledge of [formula]

In many cases [formula] is not really known. However, it might be that there is an additional independent sample with information about [formula] but not about tY. Thus we have three unbiased estimators 1Y,1X based on one sample, and 2X based on another independent sample. The best estimator of tY would be based on these three. Following the same argument as before we should consider estimator of the form

[formula]

Note that this estimator yields an unbiased estimate of tY for any [formula]. The optimal value, however, is given by

[formula]

Note, that if 2X is based on the all universe U, then [formula], and βo2  =  βo.

Even more generally, we can consider a situation in which [formula] is measured for all units in the a super sample S2, S1  ⊆  S2  ⊆  U, while the y values are measured only for units in the smaller sample S1. For example, y is measured only for one unit in a cluster, while the [formula] is measured for all units. Let [formula]. It may be natural to assume that X is correlated with Y while having a mean 0. We consider the natural extension [formula], with [formula].

Consider the super-population model in which it is assumed that [formula], [formula], [formula] where [formula] are , independent of xj,k, while xj',k' and xj,k are independent if j  ≠  j', and have correlation ρ if j = j' and k  ≠  k'. Let [formula]. Consider the sample [formula] of n clusters. Suppose that for each j∈C, xj,k, [formula] are obtained, while only yj,1 is measured, assume also that M  ≫  n. The universe size is N = MK. Hence, we assume for simplicity a simple random sample (with replacement) of clusters. Then

[formula]

It is easy to verify

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

The efficiency of the scheme increases as K increases and ρ decreases. Note that the case of a simple random sample of units in which the y value is measured only for a small random sub-sample, corresponds to ρ = 0.
