A note on the existence of an alternating sign on a spanning tree of graphs

Introduction

For a spanning tree T of a connected graph G, a labelling φ:E(T)  →  {  +  ,  -  } is called an alternating sign on a spanning tree T of a graph G if for any cotree edge [formula], the unique path [formula] in T joining both end vertices of e satisfies that φ(vivi + 1)  ≠  φ(vi + 1vi + 2) for any [formula]. The motivation of this research is the following: Bipartite graphs naturally rise in knot theory as induced graphs of Seifert surfaces of links. Plumbed Seifert surfaces play a key role in the research of the geometry of knot complements [\cite=Stallings:const]. The existence of an alternating sign on a spanning tree of bipartite graphs is a key ingredient to show the existence of such a surface [\cite=FHK:openbook] [\cite=HW:plumbing].

In the present note, we prove that any graph (not necessarily bipartite graph) has such a spanning tree T and an alternating sign on T. Note that if any graph without multiple edges and loops has such a tree and an alternating sign, then any graph with multiple edges or loops also has them. Hence in this note, we assume that any graph has no multiple edges and no loops. For any edge e  =  {u,v} in G, we simply denote the edge e by uv.

Existence of alternating signs

For a connected graph G, if G has a Hamilton path, namely, a spanning tree T isomorphic to a path, then the assignment of signs to the edges of T alternately is an alternating sign on T. In this section, we show that even though a graph G does not contain a Hamilton path, G has such a tree and an alternating sign.

Let G be a connected graph and v* be a fixed vertex of G. Then there is a spanning tree T of G such that for any cotree edge [formula], the unique path [formula] in T joining both end vertices of e satisfies that either

[formula]

or

Let TG be the set of all spanning trees of G. We define a function Ψ:TG  →  R by [formula], where dT(v*,v) is the length of the unique path joining v* and v in T. Let TM be a spanning tree of G such that Ψ(TM) =  max {Ψ(T):T∈TG}. We will show that TM is a spanning tree that completes the proof. Assume that TM does not satisfy the property. There is a cotree edge [formula] which does not satisfy the condition. Let [formula] be the unique path in T from u = v0 to [formula]. Then it is clear that dT(v*,v0)  >  dT(v*,v1). For a convenience, let [formula]. Then there exists an [formula] such that dT(v*,vi - 1)  >  dT(v*,vi) and dT(v*,vi)  <  dT(v*,vi + 1). Note that such an i uniquely exists. Let T' be the spanning tree of G having edge set [formula]. Then dTM(v*,v)  ≤  dT'(v*,v) for all v∈V(G) {vi - 1}. Since

[formula]

we have [formula]. This contradicts the maximality of Ψ(TM). It completes the proof.

Any connected graph G has a spanning tree T and an alternating sign on T.

Let v* be a fixed vertex of G. By Lemma [\ref=increase-or-decrease], there is a spanning tree T of G such that for any cotree edge [formula], the unique path [formula] in T joining both end vertices of e satisfies that either

[formula]

Define φ:E(T)  →  { + ,  -  } as follows: For any edge e = uv∈T, φ(uv)  =    +   if m(u,v) is even; and φ(uv)  =    -   if m(u,v) is odd, where m(u,v) =  max {dT(v*,u),dT(v*,v)}. Then one can easily show that φ is an alternating sign on T.

The proof of Lemma [\ref=increase-or-decrease] gives an algorithm to find a spanning tree of G having an alternating sign and the proof of Theorem [\ref=main-result] gives a way to assign alternating signs.
