Automorphisms of the two-parameter Hopf algebra [formula]

Introduction

Let [formula] be a finite dimensional complex simple Lie algebra and let [formula]. The two-parameter quantized enveloping algebras (or quantum groups) [formula] have been studied in the literatures [\cite=BW1] [\cite=BW2] [\cite=BGH] and the references therein. Recently, more studies have been conducted toward their subalgebras such as [formula], and the augmented Hopf algebras [formula]. In [\cite=T1], the author has computed the derivations for the subalgebra U+r,s(sl3), and determined both the algebra automorphism group and Hopf algebra automorphism group for the Hopf algebra [formula]. A similar work has been carried out for the algebra U+r,s(B2) and the Hopf algebra [formula] in [\cite=T2]. The results in these works suggest that the subalgebras [formula] and [formula] are close analogues of their one-parameter counterparts, which facilitates further investigation toward these subalgebras.

In this paper, we are planning to derive some similar results for the two-parameter Hopf algebra [formula] in terms of its (Hopf) algebra automorphisms. In particular, we will first determine the group of algebra automorphisms for the Hopf algebra [formula]. Then, as an application, we will further prove that the group of Hopf algebra automorphisms for[formula] is indeed isomorphic to a torus of rank 2. We will closely follow the approach used in [\cite=F].

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 1, we will recall some basics on the two-parameter Hopf algebra [formula]. In Section 2, we will determine the group of algebra automorphisms for the Hopf algebra [formula]. In Section 3, we will determine the group of Hopf algebra automorphisms for the Hopf algebra [formula].

Some basic properties of the Hopf algebra [formula]

Recall that the two-parameter quantum group Ur,s(G2) associated to the finite dimensional complex simple Lie algebra of type G2 has been studied in [\cite=HQ] [\cite=HW]. In particular, a PBW basis of Ur,s(G2) has been constructed in [\cite=HW]. For the readers' convenience, we will recall the construction of the subalgebra U + r,s(G2) together with some of its basic properties from [\cite=HQ]. In the rest of this paper, we will always assume that the parameters r,s are chosen from [formula] such that rmsn = 1 implies m = n = 0.

First of all, we need to recall the following definition from the references [\cite=HQ] [\cite=HW]:

The two-parameter quantized enveloping algebra U + r,s(G2) is defined to be the [formula]algebra generated by the generators e1,e2 subject to the following relations:

[formula]

In the rest of this section, we will establish some basic properties of the algebra U + r,s(G2) and introduce an augmented Hopf algebra [formula]. In particular, we will recall the construction of a PBW basis for the algebra U.

In order to recall the construction of a PBW basis of U + r,s(G2), we need to fix some variables. We will follow the notation in [\cite=HW].

[formula]

Now we can have the following result

(Theorem 2.4. in [\cite=HW]) The following set

[formula]

forms a Lyndon basis of the algebra U + r,s(G2).

[formula]

We now recall the definition of the Hopf subalgebra U≥  0r,s(G2) from [\cite=HQ] [\cite=HW]. We shall have the following definition.

The Hopf algebra U≥  0r,s(G2) is defined to be the [formula]algebra generated by the generators e1,e2 and w1,w2 subject to the following relations:

[formula]

Let us set

[formula]

Then, it is easy to see that the above operators define a Hopf algebra structure on the U≥  0r,s(G2); and we further have the following proposition:

The set

[formula]

forms a PBW-basis of the Hopf algebra U≥  0r,s(G2).

[formula]

To define the augmented Hopf algebra [formula], let us set the following new variables

[formula]

Now we have the following definition of the augmented Hopf algebra [formula].

The Hopf algebra [formula] is defined to be the [formula]algebra generated by the generators e1,e2 and k1,k2 subject to the following relations:

[formula]

Once again, let us further define the following

[formula]

Then, it is easy to see that the above operators define a Hopf algebra structure on the augmented Hopf algebra [formula]. Furthermore, the Hopf algebra [formula] has a PBW basis as described below.

The set

[formula]

forms a basis of [formula] over the base field [formula].

[formula]

Algebra automorphism group of the Hopf algebra [formula]

In this section, we will determine the algebra automorphism group of the Hopf algebra [formula]. We will closely follow the approach used in [\cite=F]. Note that such an approach has been adopted to investigate the automorphism group of the Hopf algebra [formula] in [\cite=T1]. Similar work has also appeared in [\cite=T2]. It is no surprise that we will derive very similar results to those obtained in [\cite=T1] [\cite=T2].

Let us denote by θ an algebra automorphism of the Hopf algebra [formula]. Since the elements k1,k2 are invertible elements in the algebra [formula] and θ is an algebra automorphism of the Hopf algebra [formula], the images θ(k1),θ(k2) of the invertible elements k1,k2 are invertible elements in the Hopf algebra [formula]. Note that it is easy to check that the only invertible elements of the algebra [formula] are of the form [formula]. Therefore, the elements θ(k1) and θ(k2) can be expressed as follows

[formula]

for some [formula] and some [formula].

Note that we can also associate an invertible 2  ×  2 matrix to the algebra automorphism θ; and we will denote this matrix by Mθ = (Mij). As a matter of fact, we will define this matrix by the entries as follows

[formula]

Due to the fact that the mapping θ is an algebra automorphism, the determinant of the corresponding matrix Mθ is either 1 or - 1. That is, we shall have that

[formula]

In terms of the PBW basis of [formula], we can further express the images of the generators e1,e2 of [formula] under the algebra automorphism θ as follows

[formula]

where γmlnlβ1lβ2lβ3lβ4lβ5lβ6l are chosen from [formula], and ml,nl are chosen from [formula], and β1l,β2l,β3l,β4l,β5l and β6l are chosen from [formula].

In the rest of this section, we prove that θ is actually defined in a simple and specific way. First of all, we are going to establish some identities, whose proofs involve straightforward verifications; and we will not record these verifications.

For l = 1,2, the following identities shall hold

[formula]

[formula]

Now we have the following proposition, which characterizes the nature of the matrix Mθ.

Let [formula] be an algebra automorphism of the Hopf algebra [formula], then we have [formula].

Proof: Since k1e1 = r- 1s- 2e1k1,k2e1 = r- 1s- 1e1k2 and θ is an algebra automorphism of [formula], we have the following

[formula]

Using the previous lemma, we shall have the following identities

[formula]

After some combinations and simplifications of these equations, we shall have the following system of equations:

[formula]

Now let us define a [formula]matrix B = (bij) by setting the entries of B as follows:

[formula]

Thus we shall have the following

[formula]

which implies that we have

[formula]

Let us denote by Mθ- 1 the matrix associated to the inverse of θ, then we have Mθ- 1 = M- 1θ. Since all the entries b11,b12,b21,b22 of the matrix B are all nonnegative integers, we know that the matrix Mθ- 1 is indeed in the group [formula]. Apply this process to the algebra automorphism θ- 1, we have that the matrix Mθ is in [formula]. So we have proved the proposition. [formula]

In addition, please note that the following important lemma was already established in the reference [\cite=F]. This lemma applies to our case as well.

If M is a matrix in [formula] such that its inverse matrix M- 1 is also in [formula], then we have M = (δiσ(j))i,j, where σ is an element of the symmetric group [formula].

[formula]

Based on Proposition 2.1 and Lemma 2.2, it is easy to see that we have the following result.

Suppose that [formula] is an algebra automorphism of the Hopf algebra [formula]. Then for l = 1,2, we have

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula].

[formula]

To proceed, we need some further preparations. Suppose that we have θ(k1) = λ1k1 and θ(k2) = λ2k2. Then we have the following

The following identities hold

[formula]

[formula]

Moreover, the identities in the previous lemma imply the following

The following identities hold

[formula]

In particular, we have the following

[formula]

[formula]

Similarly, if we assume that we have θ(k1) = λ1k2 and θ(k2) = λ2k1, then we shall have the following

[formula]

[formula]

Follows from the previous two lemmas, we can easily have the following result

Let [formula] be an algebra automorphism of the Hopf algebra [formula]. Then for l = 1,2, we have

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula].

[formula]

The following result will further demonstrate that the two generators e1,e2 of [formula] can not be exchanged by any algebra automorphism θ of [formula]. In particular, we have the following result

Let [formula] be an algebra automorphism of [formula]. Then for l = 1,2, we have the following

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula].

Proof: Suppose that θ(k1) = λ1k2 and θ(e2) = γ1km11kn12e2. Since we have θ(k1)θ(e1) = r- 1s- 2θ(e1)θ(k1), we have the following

[formula]

Note that k2e2 = r6s3e2k2, then we got a contradiction. Therefore, we have proved the statement as desired. [formula]

Now we will further establish some identities via direct calculations and we will skip the detailed calculations here.

We have the following identities:

[formula]

[formula]

Similarly, we can also have the following lemma, whose proof will be skipped.

The following identities hold.

[formula]

[formula]

Now we are ready to prove one of the main results of this paper, which describes the group of algebra automorphisms of the algebra Hopf [formula]. Namely, we have the following

Let [formula] be an algebra automorphism of the Hopf algebra [formula]. Then for l = 1,2, we have the following

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] such that c = 3b,a + 3b + d = 0.

Proof: Let θ be an algebra automorphism of [formula] and suppose that

[formula]

Note that the generators e1,e2 satisfy the following two-parameter quantum Serre relations

[formula]

Since θ is an algebra automorphism of the Hopf algebra [formula], we know that θ preserves the quantum Serre relations. In particular, we can derive the following system of equations via using the previous lemmas.

[formula]

Solving the previous system of equations, we shall obtain the following system of equations

[formula]

Therefore, we have proved the theorem as desired. [formula]

Hopf algebra automorphisms of [formula]

In this section, we will determine all the Hopf algebra automorphisms of the Hopf algebra [formula]. We denote by [formula] the group of all Hopf algebra automorphisms of [formula]. In particular, we shall prove that [formula] is isomorphic to a torus of rank 2.

To finish the task of this section, we need to establish the following result

Let [formula]. Then for l = 1,2, we have the following

[formula]

for some [formula]. In particular, we have

[formula]

Proof: Let [formula] denote a Hopf algebra automorphism of [formula], then we have [formula]. According to Theorem 2.1., we shall have the following

[formula]

for some [formula] for l = 1,2, and [formula] such that 3b = c,a + c + d = 0.

First of all, we need to show that we have λl = 1 for l = 1,2. Since θ is a Hopf algebra automorphism, we shall have the following

[formula]

for l = 1,2, which implies the following

[formula]

for l = 1,2. Thus, we have λl = 1 for l = 1,2 as desired.

Second of all, we need to show that we have a = b = c = d = 0. Note that we have the following

[formula]

In addition, we also have the following

[formula]

Since we have [formula], we shall have a = b = 0. Note that we have 3b = c and a + c + d = 0, thus we have a = b = c = d = 0 as desired.

Conversely, it is obvious to see that the algebra automorphism θ defined by θ(kl) = kl and θ(el) = γlel for l = 1,2 is a Hopf algebra automorphism of [formula]. So we have proved the theorem. [formula]
