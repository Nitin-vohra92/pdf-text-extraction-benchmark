Zero Textures of the Neutrino Mass Matrix from Cyclic Family Symmetry

Introduction

Understanding the pattern of neutrino masses and mixings constitutes a major challenge for elementary particle physics. This pattern seems to be entirely different from the observed hierarchical pattern of quark masses and mixings. In the absence of flavor symmetries, fermion masses and mixings are, in general, undetermined in gauge theories. All information about fermion masses and mixings is encoded in the relevant fermion mass matrices which are important tools for the investigation of the underlying symmetries and the resulting dynamics. The important first step in this direction is the reconstruction of the neutrino mass matrix in the flavor basis. However, this reconstruction results in a large variety of possible structures of the neutrino mass matrix depending strongly on the neutrino mass scale, mass hierarchy and the CP violating phases. In fact, no presently conceivable set of feasible experiments can determine the neutrino mass matrix completely. Therefore, in the absence of sufficient data on neutrino masses and mixings, all possible mass matrix structures need to be carefully scrutinized to find viable structures compatible with the presently available data. Several interesting proposals have been made in the literature to restrict the form of the neutrino mass matrix and, thus, reduce the number of free parameters. These include the presence of zero textures [\cite=1] [\cite=2] [\cite=3], vanishing minors [\cite=4] and hybrid textures [\cite=5] to name just a few. Zero textures in the neutrino mass matrix, in particular, have been extensively studied in the literature. The main reason for such interest in zero textures is their implications for the possible existence of family symmetries which require certain entries of the mass matrix to vanish. It has been noted earlier [\cite=6] that the zeros of the Dirac neutrino mass matrix (MD) and the heavy right-handed Majorana neutrino mass matrix (MR) may propagate as zeros in the effective low energy neutrino mass matrix (Mν) through the seesaw mechanism [\cite=7]. Zero textures in the neutrino mass matrix, in general, may be obtained by imposing certain Abelian family symmetries [\cite=8] at the expense of an extended scalar sector. Abelian family symmetries have been investigated systematically in [\cite=9] for extremal mixings. General guidelines for the symmetry realization of zero textures in both the quark and the lepton mass matrices have been propounded in [\cite=10] which outline general methods for enforcing zero entries in the fermion mass matrices by imposing Abelian family symmetries. However, specific guidelines for a simple and minimal realization of each texture are still lacking. Two zero texture Ansätz is especially important since it can successfully describe both the quark and lepton sectors including the charged lepton and the neutrino masses. The two zero textures are, also, compatible with specific GUT models [\cite=11]. Furthermore, these mass matrices can accommodate the present values of sin2β [\cite=12]. In view of the phenomenological success of the two zero texture Ansätz, it would be interesting to examine the symmetry realization of two zero texture neutrino mass matrices in the larger context of SO(10) GUT which includes both the type I and type II contributions in the seesaw mechanism. Out of the seven phenomenologically viable classes of two zero texture neutrino mass matrices (FGM), two classes have been obtained in [\cite=13] from A4 or its Z3 subgroup in the context of type (I+II) seesaw [\cite=15]. Symmetry realization of all the phenomenologically viable classes of two zero texture neutrino mass matrices was presented in [\cite=14] in the context of type II seesaw mechanism. In the present work, we present the symmetry realization of all the phenomenologically viable classes of two zero texture neutrino mass matrices in the context of type (I+II) seesaw [\cite=15] without assuming the dominance of either type of contributions. We keep just the Standard Model (SM) scalar doublet which transforms trivially under the new family symmetry (Z3 / Z4) thus, in effect, suppressing the undesired flavor changing neutral currents. An additional advantage of a single scalar doublet is the stability of zero textures in the neutrino mass matrix under renormalization group evolution. The neutrino mass matrices at any two scales μ1 and μ2 are related by [\cite=14] [\cite=16] Mν(μ1) = IMν(μ2)I, where I is diagonal and positive leading to zeros in Mν at any other renormalizable scale. These zero textures are enforced by extending the SM with at the most two scalar SU(2) triplets. However, in some cases we are forced to introduce a complex scalar singlet which transforms nontrivially under the family symmetry. The effective neutrino mass matrix contains both type (I+II) seesaw contributions which is natural in SO(10) GUTs as

[formula]

where ML is the left-handed Majorana mass matrix. Symmetry realization of one zero texture neutrino mass matrices has, also, been discussed briefly.

Symmetry Realization of Two Zero Textures

The phenomenologically allowed two zero texture neutrino mass matrices are given in Table 1. The cyclic symmetry Z3 can be used to realize class A1 when the leptonic fields transform as

[formula]

where ω = exp(2iπ / 3) is the generator of Z3. These assigned transformations generate the diagonal charged lepton mass matrix Ml. The bilinears [formula] and νRjνRk relevant for MD and MR transform as

[formula], [formula].

Since, the SM Higgs doublet transforms trivially under Z3, the form of MD becomes

[formula].

Assuming a complex scalar singlet χ that transforms under Z3 as χ  →  ω2χ, the form of MR becomes

[formula].

After the type I seesaw we get

[formula]

The bilinear DTLjC- 1DLk relevant for ML transforms under this symmetry as

[formula].

We introduce a scalar SU(2) triplet Δ written in [formula] matrix notation as

[formula]

which remains invariant under Z3. The vacuum expectation value (VEV) of Higgs triplet is

[formula]

where [formula]. This induced VEV in the scalar potential is suppressed by the high mass of the scalar triplet [\cite=14] [\cite=17]. Thus, the type II seesaw contribution is given by

[formula]

The effective neutrino mass matrix Mν after type (I+II) seesaw mechanism becomes

[formula]

which is the class A1 of FGM [\cite=1] two zero textures. For class A2, the leptonic fields under Z3 transform as

[formula]

In this case, the complex scalar singlet χ is assumed to transform as χ  →  ω2χ under Z3 resulting in the same structure of the right-handed Majorana mass matrix as of A1 and we obtain the same contribution from type I seesaw as in Eqn. (3). Assuming the scalar triplet to remain invariant under Z3, the above given transformations of the left-handed fields yield the type II seesaw contribution given by

[formula]

Thus, type (I+II) seesaw results in class A2 of FGM two zero textures. This Fritzsch-type neutrino mass matrix with a nearly diagonal charged lepton mass matrix has been obtained recently in [\cite=18] using S3  ×  Z5  ×  Z2 symmetry and an extended Higgs sector. The requisite transformations of the leptonic fields for class B3 are given by

[formula]

With the complex scalar singlet χ transforming as χ  →  ω2χ under Z3, the type I seesaw contribution is given by

[formula]

and Z3 invariant scalar triplet leads to the type II contribution given by

[formula]

thus, yielding class B3 of the FGM two zero texture neutrino mass matrices. The required leptonic field transformations under Z3 for class B4 are given by

[formula]

The complex scalar singlet χ is required to transform under Z3 as χ  →  ω2χ and the resulting type I contribution for this case is given by

[formula]

The Z3 invariant scalar triplet leads to the type II contribution of the form

[formula]

leading to class B4 of the FGM neutrino mass matrices. For classes B1 and B2, the leptonic fields are required to transform under Z3 as

[formula]

resulting in a diagonal Dirac neutrino mass matrix MD. We do not require any scalar singlet to realize MR. The resulting type I contribution becomes

[formula]

However, in these cases the scalar triplet Δ transforms under Z3 as

[formula]

resulting in type II contribution of the form

[formula]

for class B1 and

[formula]

for class B2. Type (I+II) seesaw yields classes B1 and B2 of the FGM two zero neutrino mass matrices. The scalar potential for these two cases is given by

[formula]

where φ̃ = iτ2φ* and the dots indicate quartic terms which respect Z3. The dimension three term [formula] is not allowed in the scalar potential under Z3. However, to obtain a small non-zero VEV of the scalar triplet [\cite=14] we softly break the Z3 symmetry by including this term in the scalar potential. Class C of FGM two zero textures cannot be realized by Z3 symmetry, and the next higher order group Z4 is used to realize this texture. The leptonic fields are required to transform under Z4 as

[formula]

leading to a diagonal charged lepton mass matrix, a diagonal Dirac neutrino mass matrix MD and non diagonal right-handed Majorana mass matrix MR. The type I contribution in this case is given by

[formula]

However, for symmetry realization of class C we are constrained to introduce two scalar triplets which transform as

[formula]

under Z4 leading to the type II contribution of the form

[formula]

resulting in class C of FGM neutrino mass matrices. Again, we must break Z4 softly in the scalar potential to obtain small non-zero VEV of the scalar triplets. A detailed phenomenological analysis of the FGM two zero textures has been presented in [\cite=3]. Class C of FGM textures was obtained from a horizontal symmetry Z4 with a scalar sector comprising of SM Higgs doublet and three scalar triplets [\cite=14]. Class C has, earlier [\cite=19], been obtained in a model based on non-Abelian group Q8 with a much more cumbersome scalar sector with two doublets and four triplets. Both these scenarios have been discussed in the context of type-II seesaw.

Symmetry Realization of One Zero Textures

One zero texture neutrino mass matrices can be realized from the cyclic Z3 symmetry by extending the Higgs sector. These textures are realized by extending SM with two scalar triplets, three right-handed neutrino singlets and a complex scalar singlet. Under Z3 the complex scalar singlet transforms as χ  →  ω2χ, whereas one of the scalar triplets (Δ1) remains invariant. The right-handed neutrino fields transform as

[formula]

The transformations of other fields for all classes of one zero textures in Mν are given in Table (2). The scalar potential for the one zero textures is given by

[formula]

To obtain a small non-zero VEV of the scalar triplet Δ2 we softly break the Z3 symmetry by including dimension two terms in the scalar potential where j  ≠  k. A detailed phenomenological analysis of one zero textures can be found in [\cite=2].

Conclusions

In the flavor basis, the zero textures of the neutrino mass matrix are realized using the small Abelian cyclic symmetry group Z3/Z4. All the zero textures are realized within the context of type (I+II) seesaw mechanism which is natural to SO(10) GUTs. Since, only one Higgs doublet is used in the realization of these zero textures, the flavor changing neutral current interactions are naturally suppressed. We introduced three right-handed neutrino singlets and at the most two scalar triplets which acquire small nonzero VEVs. However, in some cases we, introduced an additional complex scalar singlet which transforms nontrivially under Z3 symmetry. For one zero textures and some of the two zero textures we softly break the relevant symmetry to obtain a small non-zero VEV of scalar triplet. The zero textures in the neutrino mass matrix remain stable under RG evolution as the symmetry realization involves only the SM Higgs doublet.
