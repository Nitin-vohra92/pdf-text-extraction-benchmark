Introduction.

In this paper, the existence of nontrivial nonnegative solutions to the anisotropic critical problem

[formula]

is studied, where the exponents pi and p* satisfy the following conditions

[formula]

and the critical exponent p* is defined by

[formula]

In the best of our knowledge, anisotropic equations with different orders of derivation in different directions, involving critical exponents were never studied before. In the subcritical case, we can refer the reader to the recent paper by I. Fragala et al [\cite=FGK].

In the special case pi = 2, [formula], Problem ([\ref=aniso]) is reduced to the limiting equation arising in the famous Yamabe problem [\cite=YAM]:

[formula]

Indeed, let (M,g) be a N-dimensional Riemannian manifold and Sg be the scalar curvature of the metric g. Consider a conformal metric [formula] on M defined by [formula] whose scalar curvature (which is assumed to be constant) is denoted by [formula], where u is a positive function in [formula]. The unknown function u satisfies then

[formula]

where Δg denotes the Laplace-Beltrami operator. It is clear that, up to a scaling, the limiting problem of ([\ref=yamabe]) (Equation ([\ref=yamabe]) without the subcritical term [formula]) is exactly ([\ref=yam_lim]). The question of existence of minimizing solutions to ([\ref=yam_lim]) was completely solved by Aubin [\cite=AUB] and G. Talenti [\cite=TAL]. Their proofs are based on symmetrisation theory. Notice that this theory is not relevent in our context since the radial symmetry of solutions can not hold true because of the anisotropy of the operator.

In [\cite=PLL], P.-L. Lions introduced the famous concentration-compactness lemma which constitutes a powerful tool for the study of critical nonlinear elliptic equations. The concentration-compactness lemma allows an elegant and simple proof of the existence of solutions to ([\ref=yam_lim]) by minimization arguments. In the present work, we will adapt the concentration-compactness lemma to the anisotropic case and show that the infimum

[formula]

is achieved, of course, the functional space has to be specified.

The motivation of the present work is to give a new result which can provide extremal functions associated to the critical level corresponding to anisotropic problems involving critical exponents. Notice that the genuine extremal functions are obtained by minimization on the Nehari manifold associated to the problem and the critical level is nothing than the energy of these extremal functions.

The natural functional framework of Problem ([\ref=aniso]) is the anisotropic Sobolev spaces theory developed by [\cite=NIK] [\cite=VEN] [\cite=RAK1] [\cite=RAK2] [\cite=Troisi]. Then, let [formula] be the completion of the space [formula] with respect to the norm

[formula]

It is well known that [formula] is a reflexive Banach space which is continuously embedded in [formula]. In what follows, we will assume that

[formula]

then p* is the critical exponent associated to the operator:

[formula]

The space [formula] can also be seen as

[formula]

In the sequel, we will set p-  =   min {p1, p2, ..., pN}, p+  =   max {p1, p2, ..., pN} and [formula]. Also, the integral symbol [formula] will denote [formula] and [formula] will denote the usual Lebesgue norm in [formula]. We denote by [formula] (resp. [formula]) the space of finite measures (resp. positive finite measures) on [formula], and by [formula] its usual norm.

Existence of extremal functions for a Sobolev type inequality

In this paragraph, we shall prove that a certain best Sobolev constant is achieved. The proof will need two fundamental lemmas, the first one is a result due to M. Troisi [\cite=Troisi]:

There is a constant T0 > 0 depending only on [formula] and N such that :

[formula]

for all [formula].

The second lemma is a rescaling type result ensuring the conservation of suitable norms:

Let [formula]. For every [formula], [formula], and λ  >  0, if we write [formula], [formula], we get

[formula]

[formula]

thus, [formula].

Proof. Noticing that [formula], a straightforward computation with adequate changes of variables gives the result.

Let [formula] Then S > 0.

Proof. From Lemma [\ref=l1], we obtain that if [formula], then

[formula]

Using standard argument, the infimum

[formula]

is achieved and thus this minimum is positive. By relation ([\ref=eq1]), one concludes that [formula]. [formula] Proof. Let u be in [formula]. If u = 0 the inequality is true. If u  ≠  0, set [formula], then from the definition of S one has :

[formula]

Since [formula] if t > 1 and [formula] otherwise, the result follows from relation ([\ref=eq2]) and the definition of F. [formula]

Along this paragraph, we only need the inequality :

[formula]

We shall call (P) the minimization problem

[formula]

Let [formula] be a minimizing sequence for the problem (P). As in [\cite=PLL] and Willem [\cite=W], we define the Levy concentration function:

[formula]

Here [formula] is the ellipse defined by

[formula]

with [formula] and αi > 0 as in Lemma [\ref=l2]. Since for every n, [formula] and [formula]. There exists λn > 0 such that [formula]. Moreover there exists [formula] such that

[formula]

Thus by a change of variables one has for [formula] :

[formula]

Since [formula] we deduce that (vn) is bounded in [formula] and is also a minimizing sequence for (P). We may then assume that :

[formula] in [formula],

[formula] in [formula],

[formula] in [formula],

vn  →  v a.e in [formula].

We define :

[formula]

We start with some general lemmas. First by the Brezis-Lieb's Lemma [\cite=BL], direct computations give the following

[formula]

The lemma which follows gives some reverse Hölder type inequalities connecting the measures ν, μ and μi, [formula].

Under the above statement, one has for all [formula]

[formula]

Proof. Let [formula] and set wn = vn - v. Since [formula], we then have :

[formula]

Thus from Lemma [\ref=l1], it follows that

[formula]

On the other hand, since

[formula]

applying the estimates ([\ref=eq4]) and ([\ref=eq5]) and knowing that [formula], we deduce

[formula]

This ends the proof.  [formula]

We then have [formula]. So if [formula] then v is an extremal function since [formula] and [formula]. Thus, we want to show that fact, by proving that if it is not true then we have a concentration of ν at a single point and therefore v = 0.   Main Lemma

[formula]

The remainder of this section is devoted to the proof of the main Lemma

If [formula] then

[formula]

Proof. From Brezis-Lieb's Lemma we have :

[formula]

Since [formula], we derive the result.[formula]

[formula]

Proof. For large n, according to Lemma [\ref=l6], we have :

[formula]

Thus for all [formula], it holds:

[formula]

Letting n  →    +    ∞  , one gets :

[formula]

Using the density of [formula] in [formula], we get then

[formula]

that is the desired result.[formula]

Let ψR be in [formula] [formula] [formula] [formula]. Then for any [formula], the two equalities

[formula]

hold true, where ν∞ and μ∞ are defined by ([\ref=N.1]), ([\ref=N.2]).

Proof. As in Willem [\cite=W], one has :

[formula]

[formula]

We conclude with the definition of ν∞ and μ∞.[formula]

Let wn = vn - v. Then, for any [formula], we get

[formula]

and

[formula]

Proof. Since

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

and

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Proof. From Lemma [\ref=l6], we know that for n large enough, we have

[formula]

Thus by Sobolev inequality (Corollary [\ref=c1l3] of Lemma [\ref=l3]), it follows

[formula]

[formula]

Since

[formula]

then

[formula]

relation ([\ref=eq6]) and Lemma [\ref=l9] give :

[formula]

[formula]

Following again the arguments used in [\cite=W] we claim that:

[formula]

Proof. From Lemma [\ref=l4], we have :

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

Rewriting [formula] as

[formula]

we obtain

[formula]

[formula] Next, we shall prove the following corollary: Proof. The proof follows essentially the concentration compactness principle of P.L. Lions [\cite=PLL] because we have the reverse Hölder type inequalities of Lemma [\ref=l5].

Indeed, the second statement of this lemma implies that for all borelian sets [formula], one has:

[formula]

Since the set [formula] is at most countable because [formula], therefore D = {xj, j∈J} and [formula] satisfies [formula].   Relation ([\ref=eq99]) implies that ν is absolutely continuous with respect to μ, i.e., ν  <      <  μ and

[formula]

provided that [formula] (remember that p* > p+). Thus, we have :

[formula]

and

[formula]

Setting aj = Dμν(xj)bj, relation ([\ref=eq99]) implies that ν has only atoms that are given by {xj}, that we have already get.   Let [formula]. Then, using statement 1. of this corollary and relation ({[\ref=eq1000]), we have

[formula]

We shall consider [formula], support(φ)  ⊂  B(0,1), φ(0) = 1. We fix j∈J and set [formula]. Then [formula] satisfy [formula]. For ε > 0, we define, for every [formula]:

[formula]

Thus we have :

[formula]

and then

[formula]

Let xj∈D and φε be the function defined above associated to xj. Then :

[formula]

Proof. Since [formula] then [formula]. From Corollary [\ref=c1l3] of Lemma [\ref=l3], it follows

[formula]

From relation ([\ref=eq1002]), we have

[formula]

Since

[formula]

then one has :

[formula]

From relations ([\ref=eq110]) and ([\ref=eq113]), knowing that [formula] (see Lemma [\ref=l4]), we obtain

[formula]

[formula]

Assume that [formula] in [formula]. Then

For all j∈J, [formula] (one has support [formula].

[formula].

[formula].

Proof. From Lemma [\ref=l12], since [formula] and

[formula]

one obtains

[formula]

This shows that {xj}j∈J are all atomic points of [formula] and since [formula] is orthogonal to the atomic part of [formula], one deduces from relation ([\ref=eq114]) that

[formula]

This implies in particular that :

[formula]

Since [formula] one has

[formula]

As [formula], it holds

[formula]

which means, combining relations ([\ref=eq116]) to ([\ref=eq118]), that :

[formula]

For the last statement, we argue as before:

[formula]

where ψR = 1 on [formula], [formula], ψR = 0 if [formula], [formula]. By the definition of [formula], one has :

[formula]

and (see Lemma [\ref=l8]):

[formula]

thus, by the preceding statements:

[formula]

[formula]

If [formula] then [formula]

Proof. From Lemma [\ref=l10], we know that

[formula]

And by Corollary [\ref=c1l3] of Lemma [\ref=l3], we have

[formula]

From the last statement of Lemma [\ref=l13] and the above inequalities we deduce that :

[formula]

Thus we obtain, due to Lemma [\ref=l11], that

[formula]

Using the inequality

[formula]

we get

[formula]

It follows that [formula] and ν∞ are equal either to 0 or to 1. But using the fact that [formula], since [formula] we conclude that ν∞ = 0, [formula] (by our assumption) so that v = 0 and thus [formula].[formula]

If [formula] then the measure ν is concentrated at a single point z = xi0.

Proof. Since

[formula]

(see relation([\ref=eq116])) and [formula], we then have :

[formula]

Thus the aj are equal either to zero or to 1 that is, there is only one index i0 such that ai0 = 1 and aj = 0 for j  ≠  i0:ν = ai0δxi0.[formula]   End of the proof of the main Lemma : If [formula] thus ν concentrates at xi0 and [formula]. On the other hand we have [formula], which is impossible, we conclude then that [formula].[formula]

Consequently, the function v is a (non trivial) extremal function that can be chosen nonnegative (replacing v by [formula]).   End of the proof of Theorem [\ref=t1] : From usual Lagrange multiplier rule, there is λ0 > 0, such that :

[formula]

A similar rescaling argument used above (say [formula] ) gives the result.[formula]

The multiplicity of solutions comes directly from Lemma [\ref=l2], that is :

: Let [formula] and [formula]. Then, for all [formula] for all [formula], the function defined by

[formula]

with [formula] belongs to [formula].

is the same as for Lemma [\ref=l2] using a direct computation.

Some properties of the solutions of (1)

We want to show first the :

Any nonnegative solution u being in [formula] of (1) belongs to [formula] for all [formula].

follow the proof of [\cite=FGK]. Let a > 0. Let j be fixed in [formula], for L > 0 (large) we define [formula] and for all i

[formula]

and {

[formula]

Choosing φj,L as a test function, one has :

[formula]

Introducing k > 0, one has :

[formula]

Writing that :

[formula]

The Hölder inequality applied to the right hand side of relation ([\ref=eq8004]) shows that :

[formula]

By the Troisi's inequality (see Lemma [\ref=l1])

[formula]

Setting [formula], [formula], relations ([\ref=eq8001]) to ([\ref=eq8006]), lead to :

[formula]

Thus, for all j :

[formula]

The relation([\ref=eq8007]) infers :

[formula]

Since [formula], there exists ka > 0 such that for all [formula], such that [formula]. Thus relation ([\ref=eq8008]) infers then

[formula]

By the Troisi's inequality, one has :

[formula]

Letting L  →    +    ∞  , one has :

[formula]

Let q = (a + 1)p * , then we obtain the result.[formula]

Any nonnegative solution u being in [formula] of (1) belongs to [formula]. Moreover, there exists a number τ0 depending only on pj, N such that

[formula]

[formula] solution of (1), we set [formula] and [formula] its Lebesgue measure. Since p* > p+, one can choose q > p* so that

[formula]

Let φk = (u - k)+, for k > 0 fixed. Chosing this function as a test function and using proposition [\ref=p1], one has :

[formula]

with [formula] Since [formula], thus the corollary [\ref=c1l3] of Lemma [\ref=l3] and relation ([\ref=eq8009]) imply :

[formula]

with [formula] Thus,

[formula]

with [formula]. By Cavalieri's principle, Hölder inequality and relation([\ref=eq8011]), one has, for all k > 0:

[formula]

This last relation is a Gronwall inequality, which shows that [formula]

[formula]

Setting

[formula]

and noticing that

[formula]

thus relation([\ref=eq38]) becomes :

[formula]

Separating the contribution of [formula] and [formula], we have a continuous map [formula] and constants c5 > 0 and β depending only on p+, p* so that

[formula]

with [formula],  [formula]. Thus, from relation ([\ref=eq40]),we deduce

[formula]

But the number [formula], so relation ([\ref=eq41]) implies that there is a number τ0 > 0 depending only pj, p* such that [formula]. [formula]   Acknowledgment : The authors would like to thank the referee for his/her valuable comments.
