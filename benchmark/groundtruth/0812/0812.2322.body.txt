Introduction

The reduced Beltrami differential equation

[formula]

arises naturally in many different contexts in the theory of quasiconformal mappings; for instance in the Stoilow factorization and the G-closure problems for the general Beltrami equation

[formula]

The solutions to ([\ref=yksi]) have a number of special properties, such as [formula] being always a solution. This is the unique normalized solution fixing 0 and 1. In fact, if [formula] is a homeomorphism satisfying the equation ([\ref=yksi]) and g has two fixed points, then [formula]. We refer the reader for these and other properties of the reduced equation to the monograph [\cite=AIM]. An early application of the reduced equation for uniqueness properties of ([\ref=kaksi]) for self-mappings of the unit disk can be found in [\cite=Boj].

Studies of the reduced Beltrami equation ([\ref=yksi]) indicate that for its solutions, the null Lagrangian

[formula]

has many properties analogous to the familiar Jacobian determinant of a Sobolev mapping. This suggest the following conjecture, cf. [\cite=AIM].

Suppose [formula] is a (quasiregular) solution to the reduced Beltrami equation ([\ref=yksi]). Then either [formula] is a constant, or else

[formula]

Through the Stoilow factorization type theorems, and [\cite=AIM] in particular, the conjecture can equivalently be formulated in terms of solutions to the general Beltrami system ([\ref=kaksi]), see Section 2.

In fact, for homeomorphic solutions the conjecture is closely related to the notion [\cite=AIM] [\cite=BDIS] of linear families of quasiconformal mappings. Given a domain [formula] and an [formula]-linear subspace F  ⊂  W1,2loc(Ω), we say that F is a linear family of quasiconformal mappings, if there is [formula] such that for every g∈F, either [formula] or else g is a K-quasiconformal mapping in Ω. It quickly follows [\cite=BDIS] that [formula]. If we have the equality, then

[formula]

for some quasiconformal mappings [formula] and [formula]. In this case we say that the family F is generated by the mappings Φ and Ψ. In particular, if Φ and Ψ generate a linear family of quasiconformal mappings, then by definition each Fa,b  =  a  Φ  +  b  Ψ is injective in Ω, whenever a2  +  b2  ≠  0.

In general, quasiconformality is not preserved under linear combinations. However, if we have mappings that happen to be solutions to the same Beltrami equation ([\ref=kaksi]), then their linear combinations are at least quasiregular. Conversely, [\cite=BDIS] associates to a linear (two-dimensional) family F of quasiconformal mappings a Beltrami equation of the type ([\ref=kaksi]) satisfied by every g∈F. The next theorem, answering in positive [\cite=BDIS], implies that the associated equation is unique.

Let F be a linear family of quasiconformal mappings in a domain [formula]. If Φ,Ψ∈F, then either

[formula]

or else

[formula]

in which case [formula].

It is possible, in fact, to obtain this theorem by combining results and methods from [\cite=ANess] and [\cite=BDIS]. However, the purpose of this paper is to give a simple and direct proof to this beautiful result. Our methods in proving the theorem are similar to those of Alessandrini and Nesi in [\cite=ANess], but we will simplify their approach. For principal solutions the result was also announced in [\cite=Boj2], but unfortunately [\cite=Boj2] is not valid, with counterexamples easy to find.

Not every pair of homeomorphic solutions generate a linear family of quasiconformal mappings; simple examples can be found already among the solutions to the Cauchy-Riemann system [formula]. For instance, Φ(z)  =  z and Ψ(z)  =  z2 are both conformal in [formula], yet (some of) their linear combinations are non-injective in Ω, and thus the mappings do not generate a linear family of (quasi)conformal mappings.

However, global homeomorphic solutions to ([\ref=kaksi]) are determined by their values at two distinct points, and it follows from this fact that in the domain [formula], linear combinations of homeomorphic solutions are either constants or homeomorphisms, see [\cite=AIM]. Hence Theorem [\ref=conje] applies.

Suppose [formula] are homeomorphic solutions to ([\ref=kaksi]). Then, unless the mappings are affine combinations of each other,

[formula]

As an immediate consequence, Conjecture [\ref=conje2] follows for global homeomorphic solutions [formula] to the reduced equation ([\ref=yksi]).

There are further situations where the injectivity of a linear family of solutions to ([\ref=kaksi]) can be guaranteed. For example, if f satisfies ([\ref=kaksi]) in a bounded convex domain Ω with

[formula]

then f is injective: With the Stoilow factorization we can write [formula], where h is holomorphic in the unit disk [formula] and [formula] is a quasiconformal homeomorphism. Since [formula] maps to a convex domain, by the classical Radó-Kneser-Choquet theorem the Poisson extension U of its boundary values is one-to-one. But [formula] on [formula], hence in [formula], and by the theorem of Clunie and Sheil-Small [\cite=Clunie], or [\cite=Duren], the injectivity of h and f follows. For alternative proofs of injectivity, using properties of the Beltrami equation, see [\cite=ANess], [\cite=BDIS] or [\cite=Nesileonetti]. We now obtain the following result of Alessandrini and Nesi in [\cite=ANess].

Suppose [formula] is a bounded convex domain, and let Φ,Ψ∈W1,2(Ω) be solutions to ([\ref=kaksi]) in Ω, such that

[formula]

Then

[formula]

According to [\cite=BDIS] we have [formula] almost everywhere. Hence the corollary follows from Theorem [\ref=conje].

Finally we note that the quantity J(Φ,Ψ) arises naturally in the study [\cite=BDIS] [\cite=GIKMS] of the G-closure problems of Beltrami operators, and this connection was also the motivation in the work of Alessandrini and Nesi. In fact, combining Theorem [\ref=conje] with results and ideas developed in [\cite=BDIS] and [\cite=GIKMS], we see that the family [formula], [formula], of Beltrami differential operators

[formula]

with

[formula]

is G-compact. For the details, we refer the reader to [\cite=AIM].

Proof of Theorem 1.2

We start by reducing Theorem [\ref=conje] to the reduced Beltrami equation, using basic facts from [\cite=AIM] and [\cite=BDIS]. For this we may assume that Φ,Ψ∈W1,2loc(Ω) generate the linear family F of K-quasiconformal mappings. According to [\cite=BDIS] or [\cite=AIM], there are Beltrami coefficients μ and ν such that every element g∈F satisfies the equation

[formula]

where

[formula]

Next, following [\cite=BDIS], we apply the fact that Φ and Ψ generate a linear family of injections. Since for every [formula] the mappings a  Φ(z)  +  b  Ψ(z) are injections, we have

[formula]

As the complement of the diagonal {(z,z):z∈Ω} is connected in Ω  ×  Ω, the continuous function Λ(z,w) does not change sign. We may assume that Λ(z,w)  <  0 whenever z  ≠  w; otherwise replace Ψ by -  Ψ. From this fact and Taylor's first-order development, we obtain at points z of differentiability, thus almost everywhere, that

[formula]

The explicit details can be found in [\cite=BDIS] and in [\cite=AIM].

We now arrive at a reduced equation. Namely,

[formula]

for some quasiconformal homeomorphism f:Φ(Ω)  →  Ψ(Ω). The general Stoilow factorization theorem [\cite=AIM] states that, since Φ and Ψ satisfy the same equation ([\ref=yleinen]), the mapping f is a solution to the reduced equation,

[formula]

Here λ(w)  =   - 2iν(z) / (1 + |ν(z)|2  -  |μ(z)|2) and w  =  Φ(z). Furthermore, by the ellipticity bounds in ([\ref=yleinen]), [formula].

With the chain rule one calculates that

[formula]

almost everywhere. In particular, as quasiconformal mappings preserve Lebesgue zero sets, [formula] almost everywhere in Ω'  =  Φ(Ω). Moreover, Theorem [\ref=conje] is equivalent to showing that [formula] can vanish only in a set of measure zero.

With this reduction, we are now left to study the homeomorphic solution f∈W1,2loc(Ω') to the reduced equation ([\ref=yksi]). Let us write f(z)  =  u(z)  +  iv(z), where u and v are real valued. Similarly write λ(z)  =  α(z)  +  iβ(z).

Taking the imaginary part of ([\ref=yksi]) shows us that uy  +  vx  =  β(vx - uy), i.e.

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

Since [formula], the coefficients 2 / (β(z)  ±  1) in ([\ref=viimet457]) are uniformly bounded below. Hence to prove Theorem [\ref=conje] it suffices to show that uy  ≠  0 almost everywhere.

The trick of the proof is that, for the reduced equation ([\ref=yksi]), the derivative uy is a solution to the adjoint equation determined by a non-divergence type operator. To state this more precisely, consider an operator

[formula]

where σij  =  σji are measurable and the matrix

[formula]

is uniformly elliptic,

[formula]

for all [formula] and z∈Ω'. Here K is the ellipticity constant. Then we say that the function w∈L2loc(Ω') is a weak solution to the adjoint equation

[formula]

if

[formula]

To identify uy as a solution to an equation of the type ([\ref=viimet342]), we recall that the components of solutions f = u  +  iv   to general Beltrami equations satisfy a divergence type second-order equation, see [\cite=AIM]. In case of ([\ref=yksi]), it turns out that the component u satisfies the equation

[formula]

where the matrix elements are

[formula]

Precisely, ([\ref=div]) means that for every φ∈C∞0(Ω') we have

[formula]

But since derivatives of smooth test functions are again test functions, we can replace φ by φy∈C∞0(Ω'). In this case the identity ([\ref=ch6id]) takes the form

[formula]

Thus uy is indeed a distributional solution to the adjoint equation L*uy  =  0, where

[formula]

and a12,a22 are given by ([\ref=viimet333]). Note that the original matrix A(z) is not symmetric. However, the operator L in ([\ref=viimet345]) can be represented by the symmetric matrix

[formula]

and as [formula], from ([\ref=viimet333]) we see that σ is uniformly elliptic.

Next, we use ([\ref=kasi]) and ([\ref=viimet457]) to prove that the derivative [formula] almost everywhere. In fact, it is precisely here we use the assumption that F consists only of homeomorphisms.

Thus we may assume that uy is a non-negative solution to the adjoint equation, L*uy  =  0, where L is defined in ([\ref=viimet345]). In this case we may simply apply a result of Fabes and Stroock [\cite=fab] that the non-negative solutions to the adjoint equation satisfy a uniform reverse Hölder estimate. For the reader's convenience we recall here the explicit formulation of their theorem.

Consider the operator

[formula]

where σij  =  σji are measurable and L is uniformly elliptic with constant K.

Then there exists a constant C0, depending only on the ellipticity constant K, such that for all [formula] satisfying L*w  =  0 in a domain [formula] we have

[formula]

in every disk [formula] such that [formula].

Applying the Fabes-Stroock theorem to uy  =  w, it follows from ([\ref=viimet708]) that either [formula] or w  >  0 almost everywhere. Namely, if E: = {z∈Ω':w(z)  =  0} has positive measure and z0∈E is a point of density, we can find disks [formula] with

[formula]

and C0 is the constant of the reverse Hölder inequality ([\ref=viimet708]). Thus

[formula]

This is possible only if w vanishes identically in [formula], that is [formula]. But then we can replace the disk by a slightly larger one, argue as in ([\ref=viimet009]) and by iterating the argument prove that E  =  Ω'. Now [formula], and ([\ref=yksi]) with ([\ref=viimet457]) shows that f is holomorphic with the real valued derivative, hence affine. Therefore the mappings Φ and [formula] would not generate a linear family of homeomorphisms. Thus uy  ≠  0 almost everywhere, and we have completed the proof of Theorem [\ref=conje]. [formula]
