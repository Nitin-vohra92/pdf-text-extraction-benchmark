Introduction and statement of the main result

It is well known that a locally integrable function in [formula] belongs to [formula] (the space of functions of locally bounded variation) if and only if its subgraph has locally finite perimeter in [formula]. The connections between the analytic properties of u and the geometric properties of its (sub)graph are well described, using the more powerful language of currents, in [\cite=Federer] or [\cite=GMS]. Recall that currents provide a very natural setting to discuss analytic problems with a geometrical content, and have been successfully used in many areas. In particular, Giaquinta, Modica, and Souek introduced the notion of Cartesian current and used it to attack many problems in the calculus of variations (see the extensive monograph [\cite=GMS]) including non-linear elasticity, harmonic maps between manifolds, relaxed energies, etc.

The aim of this paper is to show the representation of a suitable class of integer rectifiable currents in [formula] as the superposition of finitely many graphs (referred to as "leaves") of functions with bounded variation. In some sense this result has some connections with Almgren's theory [\cite=almgren1], [\cite=almgren2] (developed in arbitrary dimension and codimension) of approximation, up to sets of small measure, of (minimal) currents by multi-valued Lipschitz graphs: here the regularity condition is weakened to BV, and this allows a complete description of the current, at least in codimension one, as a multi-valued graph. We rely on techniques of geometric measure theory, especially the concept of BV maps and currents in metric spaces developed in Ambrosio [\cite=Ambrosio] and Ambrosio and Kirchheim [\cite=AK].

We refer to the following section for the notation and state now the main result of this paper. If [formula] is a locally BV function, we denote by [formula] the n-dimensional boundary-free current canonically associated with the graph of u in [formula], obtained (roughly speaking) by completion of the discontinuities of u with vertical segments.

Let [formula] be an n-dimensional integer rectifiable current in [formula] satisfying the zero-boundary condition ∂T  =  0, the positivity condition [formula] and the cylindrical mass condition

[formula]

Then, there exist a unique integer N and a unique family of functions [formula], 1   ≤   j   ≤   N, satisfying

[formula]

such that the given current T is the superposition of the canonical Cartesian currents [formula] associated with the functions uj, that is,

[formula]

In addition, the following additivity property holds:

[formula]

We call each function uj a leaf of the decomposition of T, and we refer to [\eqref=e:super] as the canonical leaf decomposition of T. Heuristically [\eqref=nocance] follows from [\eqref=e:super] because all graphs have a common orientation in their intersection, so that no cancellations occur; notice that the additivity property [\eqref=nocance] does not hold for more general decompositions which satisfy condition [\eqref=e:super], but not the monotonicity assumption [\eqref=e:monot].

For an application of this result we refer to [\cite=ACL], where a geometric approach to tackle multi-dimensional scalar conservation laws is developed. Therein, solutions are defined geometrically as currents, rather than as functions satisfying entropy inequalities. The leaf decomposition is used to show the existence of entropy solutions in this setting, as the superposition of graphs of entropy solutions. (See [\cite=ACL] for details.)

Preliminaries and notation

Currents

We denote by [formula] the space of m-dimensional currents in [formula], that is the dual space of all linear and continuous functionals defined on the space [formula] of all smooth and compactly supported differential m-forms. The space [formula] is equipped with the usual weak-star topology induced by this duality. The duality bracket between a current [formula] and a form [formula] is denoted by 〈T,ω〉.

The boundary of a current [formula] is the current [formula] defined by

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the differential of the form [formula]. If [formula] and [formula] for some h  ≤  m, we denote by [formula] the saturation of the current T with the form α, which is defined by

[formula]

The (local) mass of a current [formula] is defined for every open set [formula] as

[formula]

If T has locally finite mass, the set function [formula] is the restriction to bounded open sets of a nonnegative Radon measure that we shall denote by [formula], so that [formula] for all bounded open sets [formula]. Given a current [formula] with locally finite mass, there exists a unique (up to [formula]-negligible sets) [formula]-measurable map [formula] defined on [formula] and with values in the set of m-vectors such that [formula] is a unit m-vector [formula]-almost everywhere and (here 〈  ·  ,  ·  〉 is the standard duality between m-vectors and m-covectors)

[formula]

Whenever [\eqref=may1] holds, we shall write [formula].

We will be especially interested in the subclass [formula] of all m-dimensional integer rectifiable currents T for which, by definition, there exists a triple (M,θ,τ), where [formula] is a countably Hm-rectifiable set, [formula] is a locally integrable function and τ is a Borel orientation of M (i.e. a Borel map [formula] with values in unit and simple m-vectors whose span is the approximate tangent space to M at x) such that [formula], or equivalently [formula] and [formula]. We shall also write T = (M,θ,τ), and we refer to M as the support of T and to θ as the multiplicity of T (both are uniquely determined up to Hm-negligible sets).

0-dimensional integer rectifiable currents with finite mass

In this section we consider a very special class of integer rectifiable currents, the 0-dimensional ones with finite mass on the real line [formula]. We denote by [formula] the set of these currents and we notice that it consists of those currents that can be expressed as a finite sum of Dirac masses with weight ±  1. This means that every [formula] can be written as

[formula]

where the Aj are (not necessarily distinct) points of [formula] and σj  =    ±  1. We will call average of the current [formula] the integer [formula]. For every [formula] we denote by [formula] the set consisting of all nonnegative 0-dimensional integer rectifiable currents in [formula] with average h:

[formula]

notice again that the points [formula] need not be distinct.

On the set [formula] we define

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the set of bounded real-valued Lipschitz functions defined on [formula] with Lipschitz constant less or equal than one. Notice that, if [formula] has non-zero average, then obviously [formula]; on the other hand

[formula]

for all [formula] with zero average. It is also immediate to check that, for S  =  δA  -  δB, we have [formula]. A generalization of this fact is given by the following well-known lemma.

If S and [formula] are of the form

[formula]

with [formula] and [formula], then

[formula]

We give an elementary proof, which uses ideas from the theory of optimal transportation (see [\cite=villani]). We notice first that the inequality ≥   in [\eqref=gattini] is an obvious consequence of the inequality |Aj - Bj|  ≥  |φ(Aj) - φ(Bj)| for all [formula], so we need only to build [formula] such that

[formula]

By the compactness of the support of S - S', it suffices to construct a 1-Lipschitz function φ with this property. To this aim, we first notice that the fact that the list of the Aj's and of the Bj's are ordered implies

[formula]

for any permutation σ of [formula] (this can be seen by showing that the right hand side does not increase if a permutation σ with Bσ(i)  >  Bσ(j) for some i < j is replaced by another one σ̃ with σ̃(i) = σ(j), σ̃(j) = σ(i) and σ̃(k) = σ(k) for k  ≠  i,  j). More generally, one can use [\eqref=gattini2] and the fact that permutation matrices are extremal points in the class of bi-stochastic matrices to obtain (the so-called Birkhoff theorem, see [\cite=villani])

[formula]

for any nonnegative mij with [formula] for all [formula].

The minimization of the functional [formula] subject to the above constraints on m is a (very) particular case of Monge-Kantorovich optimal transport problem of finding an optimal coupling between S and S' with cost function c(x,y) = |x - y|. Kantorovich's duality theory gives that the infimum of this problem, namely [formula], is (see [\cite=villani] again, where an explicit construction of the maximizing φ is given)

[formula]

For every fixed [formula] we define

[formula]

which is easily seen to be a finite distance in [formula] (indeed, since S and S' belong to the same set [formula], the difference S  -  S' has zero average).

Slices of a current

Given [formula] we consider the vertical slices of T at [formula],

[formula]

see for instance [\cite=AK], [\cite=simon]. This family of currents is uniquely determined, up to Ln-negligible sets, by the identity [formula], i.e.

[formula]

for all [formula]. Furthermore, the masses of Tx are related to the mass of T by

[formula]

for all bounded open sets [formula]. As a consequence, [formula] for Ln-a.e. x∈Ω whenever [formula].

The current associated to the graph of a BV function

Recall that [formula] is said to be a locally BV function if its distributional derivative [formula] is an [formula]-valued measure with locally finite total variation in [formula], and we shall denote by [formula] this total variation.

In this section we are going to describe how we can canonically associate to [formula] a current [formula] with no boundary, finite mass on cylinders [formula] with Ω bounded, and satisfying

[formula]

These two conditions are actually sufficient to characterize a unique current, see step 5 of the proof of Theorem [\ref=t:main].

Geometrically, this current corresponds to the integration on the graph of u, with the orientation induced by the map x  ↦  (x,u(x)), and this description works perfectly well when u∈C1. In order to define [formula] in the general case when [formula], we first define the subgraph E(u) of u by

[formula]

It is well known that E(u) has locally finite perimeter in [formula] (i.e. [formula]), so it has a measure-theoretic boundary (the set of points where the density of E(u) is neither 0 nor 1), that we shall denote by Γ(u). De Giorgi's theorem on sets of finite perimeter ensures that Γ(u) is countably Hn-rectifiable, and that

[formula]

(the unit vector νE(u) is the so-called approximate outer normal to E(u)). Then, we define

[formula]

where τu is the unit n-vector spanning [formula] (the approximate tangent space to Γ(u)), characterized by

[formula]

Equivalently, invoking the relation [\eqref=basic], we can define

[formula]

(here [formula]). In the case [formula], using the area formula, it is easy to check that this definition coincides with the geometric picture, and in particular that [formula] and [\eqref=carto] hold. In the general case both can be obtained, for instance, by approximation (notice that ui  →  u in [formula] implies E(ui)  →  E(u) in [formula] and therefore weak convergence of the associated currents).

We will need the following strong locality property of τu.

Let [formula] with u  ≥  v. Then τu  =  τv Hn-a.e. on [formula].

It suffices to show that νE(u)  =  νE(v) Hn-a.e. on [formula]. It is a general property of sets of finite perimeter [formula] that, for Hn-a.e. w∈∂*E, the rescaled sets (E - w) / r converge in [formula] as [formula] to the halfspace having νE(w) as outer normal. In our case, E(u)  ⊃  E(v) because u  ≥  v, so that all points w where both (E(u) - w) / r and (E(v) - w) / r converge to a halfspace, the halfspace has to be the same. This implies the stated equality Hn-a.e. of the outer normals.

Metric spaces valued BV functions

We now recall the main features of the theory of BV functions with values in a metric space, developed in Ambrosio [\cite=Ambrosio] and Ambrosio and Kirchheim [\cite=AK]. Let (E,d) be a metric space such that there exists a countable family F  ⊂  Lipb,1(E) which generates the distance, in the sense that

[formula]

We say that a function [formula] is a function of metric locally bounded variation, and we write [formula], if [formula] for every Φ∈F and if there exists a positive locally finite measure ν in [formula] such that

[formula]

The minimal ν such that the previous condition holds will still be denoted by [formula]. It is possible to check that the class [formula] and the measure [formula] are independent of the choice of the family F.

We now consider the metric space [formula] previously defined. To every [formula] we associate the map [formula] defined by

[formula]

Indeed, it is immediate to check the Lipschitz continuity

[formula]

By a standard density argument, it is possible to select a countable family [formula] with the property that

[formula]

Let E and F be metric spaces. Then [formula] whenever [formula] and M:E  →  F is an L-Lipschitz function, and [formula]. Furthermore, [formula] coincides with [formula].

Let φ∈Lipb,1(F), [formula] and [formula]; then ψ∈Lipb(E) and its Lipschitz constant is less than L; as a consequence, [formula]. Since [formula] we obtain that [formula] and [formula]. The inclusion [formula] is a simple consequence of the stability of BV functions under left composition with Lipschitz maps; to prove the opposite inclusion, let [formula] and fix an open ball [formula]; by definition all truncated functions [formula] belong to BV(B) and [formula], since we can see fa as the composition of f with the map [formula] defined as the identity for x∈[ -  a,a], as the constant a for x  >  a and as the constant - a for x  <   - a. Therefore, denoting by a their averages in B, by Poincaré inequality we obtain that fa  -  a is bounded in L1(B). Thanks to the compactness of the embedding of BV in L1, we can find a sequence ai  →    +    ∞   such that ai converges to some [formula] and fai  -  ai converge in L1(B) and Ln-almost everywhere to g∈BV(B): if [formula] we immediately obtain that f = m + g∈BV(B). If not, we obtain that |f| =  +   ∞   Ln-almost everywhere, contradicting the assumption that f is real valued.

Proof of the main theorem

This section is entirely devoted to the proof of Theorem [\ref=t:main]. We address separately the existence of the decomposition, its uniqueness and the equality of the total variations. In the course of the proof we will occasionally use forms ω in [formula] whose supports are not compact, but have a compact projection on [formula]. Their use can be easily justified by a truncation argument, based on the fact that the currents under consideration have finite mass on cylinders [formula] with [formula] bounded.

Existence of a decomposition

We proceed in 5 steps.

Step 1. We begin by proving that there exists an integer N (depending on T only) such that, for Ln-a.e. [formula], the slice [formula] is the sum of N Dirac masses with unit weight: more precisely, for Ln-a.e. [formula] there exist N real values

[formula]

satisfying

[formula]

We first show that Tx  ≥  0. Fix two nonnegative functions [formula] and [formula], and apply [\eqref=l_slice] with φ(x,y) = ψ(x)φ(y) to get

[formula]

since we assumed [formula]. Hence, by the arbitrariness of ψ, we deduce that 〈Tx,φ〉  ≥  0 for Ln-a.e. [formula]. By a simple density argument we can obtain an Ln-negligible set E independent of φ such that 〈Tx,φ〉  ≥  0 for all [formula] and [formula]. This proves that Tx  ≥  0 for all [formula].

Knowing that Tx  ≥  0, the mass of Tx is simply given by 〈Tx,1〉 (notice that this function is locally integrable by [\eqref=cylindr] and assumption [\eqref=e:massass], and takes Ln-almost everywhere its values in [formula] because Ln-almost all the slices are integer rectifiable).

We want to show that the map x  ↦  〈Tx,1〉 is Ln-equivalent to a constant in [formula]. Indeed, for every function [formula] we can compute (applying again [\eqref=l_slice])

[formula]

since ∂T  =  0. Hence we denote by [formula] the Ln-a.e. constant value of 〈Tx,1〉, and we can obviously assume that N  ≥  1. In view of the representation [\eqref=e:uff], this means that [formula] for Ln-a.e. [formula]. This leads us to the decomposition [\eqref=e:ord]-[\eqref=e:struct].

Step 2. Next, we claim that the map

[formula]

belongs to [formula].

We proceed as in the proof of Theorem 8.1 of [\cite=AK]. Recalling the definitions and the discussion in Subsection [\ref=ss:mbv], we only need to show that for every [formula] the map

[formula]

belongs to [formula], with a uniform (with respect to φ) control of the derivative.

For every [formula], applying once more [\eqref=l_slice] we compute

[formula]

using in the last equality the fact that ∂T  =  0. Therefore, taking the modulus of both sides, we obtain

[formula]

where [formula] is the projection on the x variable. This implies that the total variation of the distributional derivative of x  ↦  〈Tx,φ〉 satisfies

[formula]

Step 3. Given [formula] of the form

[formula]

let us prove that the map

[formula]

is 1-Lipschitz continuous.

Let [formula] be of the form above and [formula] be of the same form

[formula]

Then

[formula]

where we have used Lemma [\ref=l:kant].

Step 4. Finally we claim that the map

[formula]

belongs to [formula].

We have already seen in Step 2 that the map

[formula]

is [formula] and in Step 3 that the map defined by

[formula]

is Lipschitz continuous. Then, Lemma [\ref=easy] yields that their composition, namely uN, belongs to [formula], which is nothing but [formula].

Step 5. Induction and conclusion of the proof.

Up to now we have selected the top leaf of the decomposition. Now define

[formula]

It is readily checked that T̂ is an n-dimensional integer rectifiable current in [formula], satisfying the zero-boundary condition, the positivity condition and the cylindrical mass condition as in the statement of the theorem, and that for Ln-a.e. [formula] we have

[formula]

Then, it suffices to apply again N - 1 times the construction described in the previous steps to deduce that all functions uj belong to [formula] and, by construction, [formula]. Let now [formula] and let us prove that ∂R = 0 and [formula] imply R = 0. Indeed, given [formula], let [formula]; then for every [formula] we have

[formula]

Finally, property [\eqref=e:monot] is a consequence of the choice we have done in [\eqref=e:ord].

Uniqueness of the decomposition

The uniqueness of this decomposition is immediate. Assume that we have two decompositions

[formula]

with [formula] for [formula] and [formula] for [formula] satisfying

[formula]

For Ln-a.e. [formula] the slice Tx satisfies

[formula]

This immediately implies that N = M and, together with [\eqref=e:dord], that uj(x)  =  vj(x) for Ln-a.e. [formula] for every [formula].

Equality of the total variations

We know that [formula], and the locality property stated in Lemma [\ref=localtau] allows us to find a Borel orientation τ of [formula] with the property

[formula]

since by construction the functions uj satisfy [\eqref=e:monot]. Let us define θ(w) as the cardinality of the set [formula]; taking [\eqref=gat2] into account, we have then

[formula]

This proves that T = (Γ,θ,τ). As a consequence

[formula]
