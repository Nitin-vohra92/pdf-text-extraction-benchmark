Shellable Complexes from Multicomplexes

Introduction

One of the central problems in geometric combinatorics is that of characterizing the face numbers of various classes of simplicial complexes. The Kruskal-Katona theorem [\cite=MR0154827] [\cite=MR0290982] characterized the f-vectors of all simplicial complexes, while a result of Stanley characterized the face numbers of all Cohen-Macaulay complexes [\cite=MR0572989]. One fruitful line of inquiry since then has been in determining additional conditions on the face numbers of complexes with certain types of symmetry.

In particular, let Γ be a simplicial complex on n vertices, and suppose G is a group which acts on Γ. We say the action of G is proper if whenever F is a face of Γ and gF  =  F for some g∈G, then gv  =  v for each vertex v∈F, i.e., whenever an element of G fixes a face of Γ it fixes that face pointwise. Let V' be the set of G-invariant vertices of Γ and let [formula] be the G-orbits on the vertex set of Γ with size greater than 1. If the action of G is proper, no face of Γ can contain any Vi, so Γ must be a subcomplex of [formula], where l  =  |V'|, pi  =  |Vi|, Δk is the k-simplex and ∂Δk is the boundary complex of Δk. (Note also that as each face of Γ must miss at least one element of each Vi, the dimension of Γ is at most n - m - 1.)

Let [formula] (for 0  ≤  ai  ≤    ∞  ) denote the set of all monomials [formula] with ci  ≤  ai. For short, we will write [formula] for [formula] when ai  =    ∞   for 1  ≤  i  ≤  r. A non-empty subset M of [formula] is called a multicomplex if it is closed under divisibility; that is, if whenever μ|μ' and μ'∈M, then μ∈M. For M finite, let [formula]. The F-vector of a multicomplex M is [formula] where Fi is the number of elements in M of total degree i.

Recall that the h-vector of a (d-1)-dimensional simplicial complex Γ is [formula] defined by [formula] where fi is the number of i-dimensional faces of Γ. In particular, the h-vector of Γ completely determines the face numbers of Γ.

The following result is essentially due to Novik [\cite=MR2122283]. (In fact Novik considered the case pi  =  pj for all i,j, but with slight modifications her proof gives the general case, as we will address in section [\ref=generalize]).

Let Γ be a (d-1)-dimensional Cohen-Macaulay complex on [formula] vertices, where [formula], m,l  ≥  0 are arbitrary integers. If Γ is a subcomplex of [formula], then there is a multicomplex [formula] such that the h-vector of Γ is equal to the F-vector of M.

The goal of this paper is to show the converse to this theorem. In fact, we establish a slightly stronger result.

Let l  ≥  1, [formula] be arbitrary integers. Let [formula] and suppose d  ≤  n - m. If [formula] is a multicomplex such that [formula], then there is a (d-1)-dimensional shellable subcomplex Γ of [formula] such that h(Γ)  =  F(M).

Combined with Theorem [\ref=novik], this gives a generalization of a theorem of Stanley [\cite=MR0572989], which asserts that [formula] is the h-vector of a Cohen-Macaulay complex of dimension d - 1 if and only if h is the F vector of some multicomplex M  ⊆  S(  ∞  n - d).

Let [formula], m,l  ≥  0 be arbitrary integers, [formula], and d  ≤  n - m. Suppose [formula]. Then the following are equivalent:

F is the h-vector of a shellable subcomplex of [formula].

F is the h-vector of a Cohen-Macaulay subcomplex of [formula].

F is the F-vector of a multicomplex in [formula].

Before moving on, we note that a different generalization of Stanley's theorem was obtained by Björner, Frankl, and Stanley for balanced Cohen-Macaulay complexes [\cite=MR905148], which we state here for comparison.

Partition the vertex set of a simplicial complex Γ into m disjoint subsets, [formula], and let [formula] be a positive integer vector. We say Γ is a-balanced if for each facet τ of Γ and 1  ≤  i  ≤  m, [formula]. Similarly, a multicomplex M is colored of type a if its set of indeterminates can be partitioned into sets [formula] such that for any monomial [formula] and 1  ≤  i  ≤  m, [formula] (that is, the part of m supported in the variables in Xi has degree less than or equal to ai). For [formula] and 0  ≤  b  ≤  a, define fb to be the number of faces of Γ that contain exactly bi elements of Vi for each i. The array (fb)0  ≤  b  ≤  a is the refined f-vector of Γ, the refined h-vector (hb)0  ≤  b  ≤  a is given by

Similary, the refined F-vector of M is (Fb)0  ≤  b  ≤  a where Fb is the number of monomials m∈M such that part of m supported in Xi has degree bi.

[\cite=MR905148] Let [formula] be a positive integer vector and suppose F  =  (Fb)0  ≤  b  ≤  a is an array of integers. Then the following are equivalent:

F is the refined h-vector of an a-balanced shellable complex.

F is the refined h-vector of an a-balanced Cohen-Macaulay complex.

F is the refined F-vector of a multicomplex which is balanced of type a.

In particular, the proof of (3)  ⇒  (1) has a very similar structure to our proof of Theorem [\ref=main], and there seems to be a close relationship between the two results.

Idea of the Proof

For τ a face of some simplicial complex, denote by [formula] the set of all subsets of τ. Recall that a (d - 1)-dimensional simplicial complex Γ is shellable if it is pure (i.e., all of its facets have dimension d - 1) and there is an ordering of its facets [formula] such that for 1  <  i  ≤  r, the complex [formula] is pure of dimension d - 2. Such an ordering is then called a shelling of Γ. For [formula] any ordering of the facets of Γ, let TL(τi) denote the set of facets of [formula] (which will be some set of subsets of τi of size d - 1 if L is a shelling) for i > 1, and set [formula]. We then have the following nice characterization of the h-vector of Γ:

[\cite=MR0301635] Let [formula] be the h-vector of Γ. Then if L is a shelling of Γ, hi  =  |{τj:|TL(τj)|  =  i}|.

Now, suppose Γ is a simplicial complex with shelling L, and suppose K is a subset of the set of facets of Γ. Let [formula] be the ordering of K inherited from L. Suppose that TL'(τ)  =  TL(τ) for each τ∈K. Then it follows immediately that [formula] is a shellable subcomplex of Γ with h-vector [formula], where hi'  =  |{τ∈K:TL(τ)  =  i}|.

To prove Theorem [\ref=main] we will construct a shelling L of the (d - 1)-skeleton, skeld(Λ), of [formula], and show that for [formula] the F-vector of some multicomplex M in [formula], there is a subsequence [formula] of L such that each TL'(τ'i)  =  TL(τ'i), and the number of τ'i with |TL(τi')|  =  j is Fj. We then have a shellable subcomplex of skeld(Λ) with h-vector equal to the F-vector of M.

To do this, we will establish a bijection σ between the set of facets of skeld(Λ) and the set Sd of elements of [formula] with degree less than or equal to d, with the property that [formula]. For M  ⊆  Sd a multicomplex, let LM be the restriction of L to σ- 1(M). Then if TLM(τ)  =  TL(τ) for each τ∈σ- 1(M), LM gives a shelling of a subcomplex of skeld(Λ) with h-vector equal to the F-vector of M.

We will need to restrict our attention to a special class of multicomplexes. Define a partial order on our monomials as follows. For [formula] and [formula] elements of [formula] with deg(μ) = deg(μ'), say μ  <  μ' if for some i, ci  <  di and cj  =  dj for all j  >  i (reverse lexicographical order within degrees). For [formula] the F-vector of some multicomplex [formula], let Si,Fi be the set of the first Fi degree i elements of [formula] in the reverse lex order, and set [formula]. A result of Clements and Lindström will allow us to replace M with IM:

[\cite=MR0246781] Suppose M is a multicomplex in [formula], where [formula]. Then IM is a multicomplex.

In particular, we may from now on assume that our multicomplex M has the property that if deg(μ) = deg(μ'), μ  <  μ' and μ'∈M, then μ∈M (as IM clearly has this property and F(IM)  =  F(M)). Thus, it will suffice to construct L and σ such that whenever γ∈TL(τi), there exists j  <  i and divisor μ of σ(τi) such that γ  ⊆  τj, [formula], and σ(τj)  ≤  μ. Then if τi∈σ- 1(M), the properties of M require that σ(τj)∈M, so τj∈σ- 1(M), and then as γ  ⊆  τj, TLM(τi)  =  TL(τi).

An Illustrative Example

At this point it will be helpful to look at a small but non-trivial example. Let d = 4 and Λ  =  Λ(0;3,3)  =  ∂Δ2  *  ∂Δ2. The vertex set V of Λ decomposes into the vertex sets P1 and P2 of the two copies of ∂Δ2. The faces of skel4(Λ) are precisely the subsets of V of size 4 that do not contain either P1 or P2. Label the vertices of Λ as shown:

We want to build a shelling of skel4(Λ) and a correspondence σ between the facets of skel4(Λ) and the elements of S(2,2) with the properties described at the end of the last section. Given our use of the reverse lexicographical order on the set of monomials, it is tempting to simply list the facets in reverse lex order LR (which will indeed give a shelling) and for τ the [formula] facet of skel4(Λ) having |TLR(τ)|  =  j, let σ(τ) be the [formula] monomial in S(2,2) of degree j. In fact such an approach will work in some simple cases. Here, however, it fails:

In particular, consider the multicomplex M  =  {1,x1,x2,x21,x1x2,x21x2}. Note that M  =  IM, but LM  =  (1234,1245,2345,1236,1346,2356). Then TLM(2356)  =  {235,236}  ≠  TL(2356), and letting [formula], h(Γ)  =  (1,2,3,0,0)  ≠  F(M). The problem is that TL(2356)  =  {235,236,256}, and these faces first appear in facets corresponding to x21,x2 and x22. But σ(2356)  =  x21x2, the presence of which in M does not imply that of x22.

Let us examine the problem more closely. Notice that our ordering on the vertex set has resulted in each facet ending in 5 corresponding to a monomial with greatest variable x1, and any facet ending in 6 corresponding to a monomial with greatest variable x2. This leads us to define [formula] and [formula], with the observation that any facet of skeld(Λ) is, for some i, of the form [formula], where γ∈skeld - 1(Λi), and any element of Sd (aside from 1) is, for some i, of the form μxi, where μ∈Sd - 1i.

Consider Λ6. This is isomorphic to Λ(0;3,2). Note that our original ordering of facets gives a shelling of skel3(Λ6) and correspondence σ' to elements of S(2,1), by taking [formula].

Here we see the same problem as before, occurring at 235. Naïvely we might note that here we no longer have the nice correspondence between last variable and last vertex we had in the larger ordering, but this deficiency is easily fixed by a simple reordering of the vertex set. In fact, consider the shelling and map obtained if we order our facets as if 4 > 5, while retaining our ordering on the monomials:

It is simple to check that this correspondence has the property described at the end of the previous section, and we may furthermore, we can use this to fix our original attempt, by reordering the facets ending in 6 to match our new ordering on the facets of skel3(Λ6):

The example suggests that we should build our shelling and map σ inductively, at each step making sure the vertices are ordered so that the last m vertices are from [formula], respectively. This is how we shall proceed.

Construction of the Shelling and Bijection

Let [formula] with [formula]. Let V' be the vertex set of the Δl - 1 in the construction of Λ and for 1  ≤  i  ≤  m let Pi be the vertex set of ∂Δpi  -  1. (We will now allow pi = 1, in which case [formula], for the sake of an induction argument to come; similarly, we will allow [formula] where ai  =  0, in which case we simply drop the variable xi). Let [formula], and let [formula]. Let [formula].

As we will be changing the ordering on the vertices at different steps of our induction, we will require some additional notation. For O denoting a total ordering [formula] of V, let Λk,O be Λk, as defined in the previous section, with respect to ordering O. (The ordering [formula] will remain fixed, so Sk may remain as above.)

Recall that one characterization of a shelling [formula] is that for each i there exists a face R(τi) of τi such that [formula]. (Note in particular that |TL(τi)|  =  |Ri|.) Examining the two shellings of skel4(Λ(0;3,3)) in our example in the last section, we see that both yield the same R(τ) for each facet τ of skel4(Λ). It will be helpful to determine the exact structure of the R(τ) in the shelling obtained by listing the facets of skeld(Λ) in the reverse lexicographical order.

Let τ be a face of Λ, and O an ordering of V. Then let [formula], and for i∈full(τ) let miss(τ,i) be the element of Pi not in τ (the notation is meant to suggest that full(τ) collects the indices of the sets Pi such that [formula] is 'full' in the sense that no further elements of Pi could be added without leaving Λ, and miss(τ,i) is the element of Pi missing from τ). Let sO(τ) be the first element of [formula] not appearing in τ (with respect to order O) if such an element exists, otherwise set sO(τ)  =    ∞  . Let τ> sO  =  {y∈τ:y  >  sO}, and [formula]. Finally, let [formula].

Let Λ  =  Λ(1;5,4,3), with vertex ordering O as shown:

Consider the face τ  =  {y1,y2,y4,y5,y6,y9,y11,y12}. Then full(τ)  =  {2}, miss(τ,2)  =  y3, UO(τ)  =  {y6,y9,y12}, sO(τ)  =  y7, and τ> sO(τ)  =  {y9,y11,y12}. So RO(τ)  =  {y6,y9,y11,y12}.

Now, if τ is a facet of skeld(Λ) and γ is a facet of [formula], γ  =  τ  -  yi for some yi∈τ. Then γ appears as a face of a facet occurring before τ in the reverse lex order (as determined by the ordering O on the vertices) if and only if [formula] is a facet of skeld(Λ) for some j  <  i. It may easily be checked that τ is the reverse lexicographically first facet of skeld(Λ) containing RO(τ), so if RO(τ)  ⊆  γ, γ occurs in no earlier facet. On the other hand, if there is yr in RO(τ) such that yr∉γ, either yr∈UO(τ), in which case [formula] (where yr∈Pk) is a reverse lexicographically earlier facet of skeld(Λ) containing γ, or yr  >  sO(τ), in which case [formula] is an earlier facet of skeld(Λ) containing γ. Thus, if [formula] is the reverse lex order on the facets of skeld(Λ), [formula]. Our inductively built shelling will share this structure.

We are now ready to prove our central theorem.

Let Λ and S be as above, and let O be an ordering [formula] of V such that for 1  ≤  i  ≤  m, yn - m + i∈Pi. Let 1  ≤  d  ≤  n - m. Then there exists a shelling [formula] of skeld(Λ) and bijection σ from the set of facets of skeld(Λ) to Sd such that:

[formula].

deg(σ(τi))  =  |TL(τi)|.

If γ∈TL(τi), then there exists j < i and μ|σ(τi) such that γ  ⊆  τj, deg(μ) = deg(σ(τj)), and σ(τj)  ≤  μ.

Again, condition ([\ref=R]) is sufficient to show that L is a shelling. Theorem [\ref=main] follows from (2) and (3), the proof of the latter requiring our precise definition of RO.

(of Theorem [\ref=big])

We will proceed by induction on d. If d = 1, let [formula]), σ(y1)  =  1, and σ(yi)  =  xi - 1 for 1  <  i  ≤  n. Properties (1)-(3) immediately follow.

Now, suppose 1 < d  ≤  n - m. Set [formula]. By the properties of our order on V, τ01 does not contain any Pi, and hence is a facet of skeld(Λ). Set σ(τ01)  =  1.

Any other facet τ of skeld(Λ) has the form [formula] where τ'∈skeld - 1(Λd + k,O) for some k > 0. Similarly, any element of Sd aside from 1 is of the form μxk where μ∈Sd - 1k for some k  ≥  1.

Suppose d + k  ≤  n - m. Then skeld - 1(Λd + k,O) is simply the (d - 2)-skeleton of the simplex on the first d + k - 1 vertices in V. Then the ordering Ok on these vertices inherited from the original order on V satisfies the condition of our theorem, so by induction there exists a shelling of skeld(Λd + k,Ok) and map σk from its set of facets to Sd - 1(  ∞  d + k - 1  -  (d - 1))  =  Sd - 1(  ∞  k)  =  Sd - 1k satisfying (1)-(3). Call this shelling [formula].

On the other hand, if d + k  =  n - m + i for some 1  ≤  i  ≤  m, then [formula]. In this case, the restriction of the order on V does not quite meet the conditions of the theorem. Let yk be the largest element of Pi  -  yd + k with respect to O, and define a new order Ok by [formula] ( i.e., take the original order but set yi  <  kyk for all yi  ≠  yk, as in the example in the previous section). This new order satisfies the conditions of our theorem, and so by induction we have a shelling [formula] of skeld - 1(Λd + k,Ok) and map σk from the set of its facets to [formula] satisfying (1) - (3).

For 1  ≤  k  ≤  n - d, and 1  ≤  i  ≤  rk, set [formula] and σ(τki)  =  σ(Gki)xk. Let [formula]. Our claim then is that L and σ satisfy (1)-(3).

(1) The k = 0 case is immediate. Now suppose k > 0. Set [formula]. We will first show that [formula], and then that Rki  =  RO(τki).

Let Λ, O, and τ be as in Example [\ref=uex]. Then [formula], where G∈skel7(Λ12)  =  skel7(Λ(3;5,3)). In the new ordering O12, y9 becomes the last vertex, so labeling the ith vertex in this ordering y'i, we have y'i  =  yi for i  <  9, y'9  =  y10, y'10  =  y11, and y'11  =  y9. Observe that [formula].

Returning now to the proof, suppose γ  ⊆  τki and Rki  ⊆  γ. Then yd + k∈γ, so γ cannot be in any τk'i for k'  <  k. On the other hand, as γ  -  yd + k contains ROk(Gki), there is no j < i such that Gkj contains γ  -  yd + k. Hence γ is not in any τkj for j < i, so γ can occur in no facet appearing before τki.

Now suppose Rki is not contained in γ. Then there is at least one element of Rki not in γ. If some such element is in ROk(Gki), then γ  -  yd + k is a face of Gki not containing ROk(Gki), so there is j < i such that γ  -  yd + k  ⊆  Gkj, and then γ  ⊆  τkj. Otherwise, γ  =  τki  -  yd + k  =  Gki. Now, there is clearly some r  <  d + k such that yr∉Gki. Suppose, in order to obtain a contradiction, that for each such r, [formula] is not a facet of skeld(Λ), i.e., [formula] contains some Ps. Then d + k  =  n - m + j for some j > 1 (otherwise, Gki cannot contain any element of the form yn - m + s for 1  ≤  s  ≤  m, and adding any vertex before yd + k cannot complete Ps). But then there are at least |Pi| - 1 elements of each Pj occurring before yd + k in our ordering, so Gki must contain at least |Pj| - 1 elements of each Pj, in addition to all of V'. Hence [formula], a contradiction. Hence, there is some r  <  d + k such that [formula] is a facet of Λd. This facet occurs before τki and contains γ.

It remains to show that Rki  =  RO(τki) for k > 0. We first confirm that yd + k∈RO(τki). If yd + k  >  sO(τki), the yd + k is in RO(τki), so suppose yd + k  <  sO(τki). Then as yd + k is the greatest element of τki, τki must consist of every element of [formula] less than yd + k. Suppose d + k  ≤  n - m. Then τki cannot contain the largest element of any Pi, so in particular miss(τki,j)  >  yd + k for any j∈full(τki). Thus τki is just the first d elements of V, i.e. τ01. But k > 0, so we must have d + k  =  n - m + j for some j, and in particular yd + k is the largest element of Pj. But then j∈full(τki) and yd + k  >  miss(τki,j), so yd + k∈UO(τki)  ⊆  RO(τki).

Now suppose d + k  ≤  n - m. In this case our orderings O and Ok are the same, so sOk(Gki)  =  sO(τki). Furthermore, as τki cannot contain the largest element of any Pj, [formula]. Thus [formula].

On the other hand, suppose d + k  =  n - m + j. Observe that the vertices corresponding to the indices in full(Gki) are the same as those corresponding to the indices in full(τki), and as yr is the largest element of Pj  -  yd + k (with respect to both orders), with Ok matching O on all the other vertices, UO(τki) and UOk(Gki) agree, except for the possible presence of yd + k in the former. But we have already seen that yd + k must be in both Rki and RO(τki).

Suppose sOk(Gki)  <  yk. Then sO(τki)  =  sOk(Gki). Furthermore, for y∈Gki, y  >  sO(τki) if and only if y  >  ksO(τki). Thus Rki  =  RO(τki).

On the other hand, suppose sOk(Gki)  ≥  yk. As yk is the greatest element of Pj  -  yd + k, any other element y of Pj  -  yd + k is less than sOk(Gki) in both orders. Thus, either all of these elements are in Gki or exactly one is missing and every other element of Pj  -  yd + k is in Gki.

First, suppose every element of Pj  -  yd + k less than yk is in Gki. Then yk cannot be in Gki, and in particular yk  =  miss(Gki,j)  =  miss(τki,j). Thus sO(τki)  =  sOk(Gki) (as the changing of the position of yk in the order will have no effect on s). Furthermore, sO(τki)  ≠  yr, and yr∉τki. Then for y∈Gki, y > ksOk(Gki) if and only if y  >  sO(τki). Thus Rki  =  RO(τki).

Now suppose instead that Gki contains every element of Pj except some y < yr. Then in particular yr∈Gki, so sO(τki)  =  sOk(Gki)  ≠  yr. Thus for y  ≠  yr, y > ksOk(Gki) if and only if y  >  sO(τki). It now only remains to check the membership of yr in Rki and RO(τki). But yr∈UO(τki)  =  UOk(Gki), and is thus in both Rki and RO(τki). Hence (1) is proved.

(2) Note that |TL(τki)|  =  |RO(τki)|  =  |ROk(Gki)|  +  1. Then as [formula], (2) follows from the definition of σ.

(3) The k = 0 case is trivial. Suppose k > 0 and γ∈TL(τki). Then γ is obtained from τki by removing some element of RO(τki). Suppose that element is not yd + k. Then γ  -  yd + k∈TLk(Gki). Thus, there exists j < i and divisor μ of σk(Gki) such that γ  -  yd + k∈Gkj, deg[formula], and σk(Gkj)  ≤  μ. Then γ∈τkj, μxk is a divisor of σ(τki), [formula], and σ(τji)  ≤  μxk.

On the other hand, suppose γ  =  τki  -  yd + k. We claim there exists a facet τrt for some r  <  k such that deg(σ(τrt))  =   deg(σ(τki)).

First consider the case yd + k∈UO(τki), where yd + k∈Pj. Then let [formula] . Note that sO(τ')  =  sO(τki) and full(τki)  =  full(τ'). Suppose y∈RO(τ') and y  ≠  miss(τki,j). Then y∈τki, and if y  >  sO(τ'), y  >  sO(τki), so y∈RO(τki). On the other hand, if y∈UO(τ'), then y∈UO(τki), as miss(τ',q)  ≥  miss(τki,q) for all q∈full(τ')  =  full(τki). Thus y∈RO(τki). In particular, note that every element of RO(τ')  -  miss(τki,j) is in RO(τki), and as yd + k is in RO(τki) but not τ', RO(τ')  -  miss(τki,j)  ⊆  RO(τki)  -  yd + k. Hence |RO(τ')|  ≤  |RO(τki)|.

Again take Λ, O, and τ as in Example [\ref=uex], and consider γ  =  τ  -  y12.

If yd + k∉UO(τki), let [formula] (and recall that since k > 0, we have seen that sO(τki)  <  yd + k). Then sO(τ')  >  sO(τki). Suppose y∈RO(τ') and y  ≠  sO(τki). Again, y∈τki. If y  >  sO(τ'), y  >  sO(τki), so y∈RO(τki). On the other hand, suppose y∈UO(τ'). If y∈UO(τki), then y∈RO(τki). Suppose y∉UO(τki). Then for some q, τ' contains all but one element, b, of Pq, y∈Pq, and y > b, but τki is missing at least 2 elements of Pq. As sO(τki) is the only element of τ' not in τki, sO(τki) must be in Pq, and the only other element of Pq not in τki must be b. In particular, b∉τki, so b  ≥  sO(τki). But as y∈UO(τ'), y  >  b, so y  >  sO(τki), and thus y∈RO(τki). In particular, note that every element of RO(τ')  -  sO(τki) is in RO(τki), and as before we see that RO(τ')  -  sO(τki)  ⊆  RO(τki)  -  yd + k. Hence |RO(τ')|  ≤  |RO(τki)|.

In either case, τ' is a facet of skeld(Λ) containing γ, and by construction must be equal to τrt for some r < k. Since |RO(τ')|  ≤  |RO(τki)|, [formula]. If r  =  0, σ(τ')  =  1, a divisor of σ(τki). Otherwise, σ(τ') is some monomial in [formula]. Let μ be the reverse lexicographically largest divisor of σ(τki) whose degree is the same as that of σ(τ'). Then yk divides μ, and as the support of σ(τ') is in variables less than xk, σ(τ')  <  μ. Thus (3) is proved.

Theorem [\ref=novik]

The proof of Theorem [\ref=novik] is essentially that given by Novik in [\cite=MR2122283] for the pi  =  pj case, so we here give an abbreviated account with the necessary modifications, referring the reader to [\cite=MR2122283] for full details.

Let [formula], and let Γ be a (d - 1)-dimensional Cohen-Macaulay subcomplex of Λ. Let Pi and V' be as defined in the previous section and label the vertices of Λ with variables [formula], ordered so that xi∈Pi for 1  ≤  i  ≤  m, and xi∈V' for n - l + 1  ≤  i  ≤  n. Let [formula] be a field and [formula]. Recall that the Stanley-Reisner ideal of Γ, IΓ, is the ideal generated by monomials [formula] such that [formula] is not a face of Γ.

For [formula], g defines an automorphism of [formula] by [formula]. We say g possesses the Kind-Kleinschmidt condition if for every facet [formula] of Γ, the submatrix of g- 1 obtained by taking the intersection of the rows numbered [formula] with the last d columns has rank r. For such a g, let [formula].

Finally, for I an ideal in [formula], let [formula], where [formula] is the order given by [formula] if either deg(μ)  <   deg(μ') or deg(μ)  =   deg(μ') and μ'  <  μ in our original order on monomials (notice the reversal). The crux of the proof lies in the fact that Bs(g,J(g)) is a multicomplex, and that F(Bs(g,J(g)))  =  h(Γ). We additionally make use of the fact [formula]. It thus suffices to construct a matrix g satisfying the Kind-Kleinschmidt condition such that Bs(g,gIΓ) does not contain xpii for 1  ≤  i  ≤  m.

To do this we first pass to a larger field. Let [formula] be the field of rational functions in [formula] variables, where Y  =  (yij), W  =  (wij) and Z  =  (zij) are [formula], l  ×  l, and [formula] matrices, respectively. Let E  =  (Eij) be the [formula] matrix where

[formula]

Define

Now, for each i, Pi∉Γ, so IΓ contains [formula]. Then gIΓ contains Thus xpii∉Bs(g,gIγ), so [formula].

It remains only to show that g satisfies the Kind-Kleinschmidt condition. Note that the ith row of EY is equal to the sum of the rows of Y indexed (in the larger matrix g) by j  >  m such that xj∈Pi. Since no facet of Λ contains Pi, and the entries of Y, W and Z are algebraically independent, it then follows that for [formula] a facet of Γ, the determinant of the submatrix of g- 1 defined by the intersection of the last d columns and the rows numbered [formula] is non-zero, so the Kind-Kleinschmidt condition holds.

Remarks

Note that the class of subcomplexes of [formula] is larger than that of complexes having proper G action with corresponding orbit structure. Thus one does not expect our conditions to be sufficient for face numbers of complexes with proper group action. Indeed, in [\cite=MR932113] Stanley showed necessary conditions on the h-vectors of centrally symmetric Cohen-Macaulay complexes not implied by our conditions, which were later generalized by Adin in [\cite=MR1354672] to the case of Cohen-Macaulay complexes with proper [formula]-action. It would be of interest to determine sufficient conditions in this more restricted case.

Also, as mentioned in the introduction, there seems to be a close relationship between Corollary [\ref=gen] and Theorem [\ref=bfsgen]. In particular it may be possible to achieve a further generalization capturing both results as part of some larger phenomenon.
