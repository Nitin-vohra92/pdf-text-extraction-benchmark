In this paper we consider particular subalgebras of a full matrix algebra [formula]. (By a subalgebra we mean *-subalgebra with unit.) An F-subalgebra is a subalgebra isomorphic to a full matrix algebra Mk. ("F" is the abbreviation of "factor", the center of such a subalgebra is minimal, [formula].) An M-subalgebra is a maximal Abelian subalgebra, equivalently, it is isomorphic to [formula]. ("M" is an abbreviation of "MASA", the center is maximal, it is the whole subalgebra.) If A1 and A2 are subalgebras, then they are called quasi-orthogonal or complementary if the subspaces [formula] and [formula] are orthogonal (with respect to the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product [formula] ). Concerning complementary subalgebras we refer to [\cite=PDcomp], see also [\cite=Ohno] [\cite=OPSz] [\cite=m4].

Complementary M-subalgebras can be given by mutually unbiased bases. Assume that [formula] and [formula] are orthonormal bases such that

[formula]

If A1 is the algebra of all operators with diagonal matrix in the first basis and A2 is defined similarly with respect to the second basis, then A1 and A2 are complementary M-subalgebras.

There are examples such that Mn is the linear span of pairwise complementary subalgebras in the case when n is a power of a prime number. If Mn is decomposed into complementary subalgebras, then we construct trace-preserving mappings Mn  →  Mn which are completely positive under some conditions.

Introduction

If the pairwise complementary subalgebras [formula] of Mn are given and they linearly span the whole algebra Mn, then any operator is the sum of the components in the subspaces [formula] (1  ≤  i  ≤  r) and [formula]:

[formula]

where Ei:Mn  →  Ai is the trace-preserving conditional expectation (which is nothing else but the orthogonal projection with respect to the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product, see [\cite=pd2] about details). It is easier to formulate things for matrices of trace 0. If [formula], then it has orthogonal decomposition

[formula]

As a generalization of the Pauli channel on a qubit, we define a linear mapping α:Mn  →  Mn such that

[formula]

or for an arbitrary A

[formula]

where [formula], 1  ≤  i  ≤  r. We want to find the condition for complete positivity. The motivation is the following well-known example in which the complementary subalgebras are generated by the Pauli matrices [\cite=pd2].

It is not obvious that condition ([\ref=E:4]) is symmetric in the three variables λ1,λ2,λ3. Condition ([\ref=E:4]) actually determines the tetrahedron which is the convex hull of the points (1,1,1), (1, - 1, - 1), ( - 1,1, - 1) and ( - 1, - 1,1).

Now we show the idea leading to the generalization. The mapping E in ([\ref=E:3]) has the form

[formula]

From the expansion of E(σj) we can get equations and the solution is the following:

[formula]

If μi  ≥  0 for every i, then E is a completely positive mapping. Therefore,

[formula]

or together this is ([\ref=E:4]). (Actually, this argument gives that ([\ref=E:4]) is a sufficient condition for the complete positivity.)

Pauli channels form an important and popular subject in quantum information theory [\cite=BFS] [\cite=Fuji] [\cite=King]. The mappings ([\ref=E:al]) were studied in the paper [\cite=NR] in the case when the subalgebras are maximal Abelian and pairwise complementary. Our method is different and we allow non-commutative subalgebras as well.

The mapping ([\ref=E:al]) restricted to Ai has the form

[formula]

on density matrices D. If 0  ≤  λi  ≤  1, then we can say that D does not change with probability λi and with probability 1 - λi it is sent to the tracial state. Such mappings are usually called as depolarizing channels [\cite=pd2].

A simple example including non-commutative subalgebras is the following.

Our main result is the necessary and sufficient condition for the complete positivity of mappings like ([\ref=E:al]) which can be called generalized Pauli channel.

Generalized Pauli channels

Let A be a (unital *-) subalgebra of Mn. Our aim is to describe the conditional expectation onto A by means of an orthogonal system in the commutant.

Up to unitary equivalence, a subalgebra A of Mn can be written as

[formula]

The commutant A' in Mn is

[formula]

Let [formula] and let Pi be a minimal central projection of A, that is, [formula].

Let {Ui}Ni = 1 be an orthonormal basis of A. Then the completely positive map F from Mn onto A' given by

[formula]

is equal to

[formula]

where [formula] is a partial trace from [formula] onto Mmi.

In particular, if all ni  /  mi are equal, then [formula] is the trace-preserving conditional expectation from Mn onto A'.

Proof: If all ni  /  mi are equal, then their ratio is equal to [formula]. Therefore it is sufficient to prove the first assertion.

Let {e(l)ij}nli,j = 1 and {f(l)ij}mli,j = 1 be matrix units of Mnl and Mml, respectively. Then Ui is written by

[formula]

for some [formula]. The operator W∈MN given in terms of its matrix entries by the formula

[formula]

for 1  ≤  i  ≤  N, 1  ≤  l  ≤  k and 1  ≤  s,t  ≤  nl is unitary. Indeed, W can be considered as the matrix which takes the orthonormal basis [formula] of A into the orthonormal basis {Ui}. Hence we have

[formula]

and therefore

[formula]

Let T be a partial isometry with [formula] and [formula]. Then we obtain

[formula]

by ([\ref=unitary1.1]) so that F maps the off-diagonal part to 0, that is, if l1  ≠  l2 then F(T) = 0.

Now let [formula]. Then we obtain

[formula]

which shows the first assertion. [formula]

The commutant of M-subalgebras and F-subalgebras are again M-subalgebras and F-subalgebras, and in both types it is possible to choose an orthogonal basis consisting of unitaries, only. Thus by an application of the previous proposition, for such a subalgebra A, the trace-preserving conditional expectation is the convex combination of automorphisms:

[formula]

where {Ui'} is an orthogonal basis of A' consisting of unitaries. Bases consisting of unitaries are important also in quantum state teleportation [\cite=We].

Let {Ui:1  ≤  i  ≤  m} be an orthonormal system in Mn. Then the linear mapping

[formula]

is completely positive if and only if μi  ≥  0 for every 1  ≤  i  ≤  m.

Proof: If [formula] for every 1  ≤  i  ≤  m, it is clear that α is completely positive. To prove the converse, we first show that

[formula]

is a projection if [formula]. This is obviously self-adjoint and we can compute that it is idempotent:

[formula]

It follows that

[formula]

is a projection for every 1  ≤  k  ≤  m. To show that they are pairwise orthogonal, we compute the trace of PkPl:

[formula]

Due to the Lemma [\ref=L:1] below this equals [formula] when k  ≠  l.

The complete positivity implies that

[formula]

is positive, therefore μk  ≥  0. [formula]

[formula]

Proof: Since both sides are bilinear in the variables X and Y, it is enough to check the case X = Eab and Y = Ecd. Simple computation gives that left-hand-side is δabδcd. A physicist might make a different proof of the lemma:

[formula]

and the right-hand-side is [formula]. [formula]

We also need the next lemma; the proof can be found in [\cite=We].

Let [formula] be matrices in Mn. Then the following conditions are equivalent:

1. [formula]

2. [formula]

The next result includes important particular cases which are formulated afterwards.

Let [formula] be pairwise complementary subalgebras of Mn such that their commutants [formula] are pairwise complementary as well. Then the trace-preserving conditional expectations Ej:Mn  →  Aj can be expressed by the orthonormal bases [formula], where [formula], via the formula

[formula]

and the generalized Pauli channel ([\ref=E:al]) is completely positive if and only if

[formula]

for every 1  ≤  i  ≤  r and

[formula]

To prove this theorem we prepare the following proposition.

Let A1 and A2 be complementary subalgebras of Mn. Then A1' and A2' are complementary if and only if A1A2 linearly spans Mn. Moreover, in this case the trace-preserving conditional expectation E1:Mn  →  A1' can be expressed as

[formula]

where {Ui} is an orthonormal basis of A1.

Proof: Assume A1' and A2' are complementary. Let {Ui'} and {Vj'} be orthonormal bases of A1' and A2', respectively, which consist of scalar multiple of their matrix units. Then the trace-preserving conditional expectations onto A1 and A2 are given by the linear combinations of Ui'*(    ·    )Ui' and Vj'*(    ·    )Vj', respectively, thanks to Proposition [\ref=cond].

Since A1' and A2' are complementary subalgebras, {Vj'Ui'}i,j is an orthogonal system. Moreover the trace is written by the linear combination of Ui'*Vj'*(    ·    )Vj'Ui', because A1 and A2 are complementary subalgebras if and only if the composition of two conditional expectations equals to [formula]. But this shows that {Vj'Ui'}i,j linearly spans the whole Mn thanks to Lemma [\ref=lemma1].

Conversely assume A1A2 linearly spans the whole space Mn. Since A1 is a subalgebra of Mn, A1 can be written as

[formula]

Let Q be a minimal central projection in A2 and let {U(s)i} and {Vj} are orthonormal bases of A1 and A2, respectively, with the assumption [formula]. Since A1 and A2 are complementary and span{A1A2}  =  Mn, [formula] is an orthonormal basis of Mn. Therefore by Lemma [\ref=lemma1] and Proposition [\ref=cond], we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

for some c > 0. These equations imply, for 1  ≤  s  ≤  k,

[formula]

where Ps is a central projection [formula]. Now we take the trace to the above equation. Then we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

so that

[formula]

Hence ns   /   ms is equal to [formula] for all 1  ≤  s  ≤  k and so

[formula]

is the trace-preserving conditional expectation onto A1' by Proposition [\ref=cond]. Similarly,

[formula]

is the trace-preserving conditional expectation onto A2'. Since

[formula]

is the normalized trace on Mn by Lemma [\ref=lemma1], we obtain [formula] and so the composition [formula] equals to [formula]. [formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=L:**]. The first assertion is already proven in the above proposition. Due to the Lemma [\ref=lemma1], we have

[formula]

where orthonormal system Wt extend the orthonormal system Ujk to a complete system in the linear space Mn. In formula ([\ref=E:al]) we use this expression for [formula] and the assumed decomposition of the conditional expectations. So in the expansion of α(A) the coefficient of U*jkAUjk is

[formula]

and the coefficient of [formula] is

[formula]

Theorem [\ref=T:A] tells us that completely positivity holds if and only if both are positive. [formula]

Assume that Mn contains pairwise complementary M-subalgebras [formula]. Then the generalized Pauli channel is completely positive if and only if

[formula]

for every 1  ≤  i  ≤  r.

This result appeared also in [\cite=NR].

Bipartite channels

In this section we consider subalgebras of [formula]. A subalgebra isomorphic to Mn will be called F-subalgebra. An M-subalgebra is a maximal Abelian subalgebra. Both kinds of subalgebras are subspaces of dimension n2.

Assume that A1 and A2 are F- or M-subalgebras of [formula]. If they are complementary, then the commutants A1' and A2' are complementary as well.

Proof: Since both kinds of subalgebras are subspaces of dimension n2, the dimension of A1A2 is n4 so that [formula]. Therefore the commutants A1' and A2' are complementary by Proposition [\ref=prop2]. [formula]

Assume that [formula] is decomposed to pairwise complementary F- and M-subalgebras Ai (1  ≤  i  ≤  n2 + 1). The trace-preserving conditional expectation of [formula] onto Ai is denoted by Ei. The linear trace-preserving mapping acting as

[formula]

is completely positive if and only if

[formula]

for every 1  ≤  i  ≤  n2 + 1.

Proof: Theorem [\ref=T:3] allows to use Theorem [\ref=L:**] and the result follows. [formula]

The theorem can be applied in Example [\ref=Ex:2]. Note that decompositions of [formula] into F- and M-subalgebras are discussed in [\cite=m4], while decomposition of [formula] into F-subalgebras is constructed in [\cite=Ohno] if n = pk with a prime number p > 2.
