Singularities of Hinge Structures

Introduction

A hinge in the Euclidean space Rd is formed when two d-dimensional bodies or two (d - 1)-dimensional panels are articulated along a common (d - 2)-dimensional affine space (the hinge axis), so that the possible relative motions of one object with respect to the other consist only of rotations fixing the given hinge axis. Motion along the hinge axis is prohibited.

This situation appears for molecular conformations in R3, when part of a molecule rotates with respect to the remaining part around an axis corresponding to a chemical bond. Figure 1 schematically represents a piece of a protein backbone [\cite=BT] as a panel-and-hinge structure.

We consider ordered chains of n bodies or codimension-one panels [formula], which are articulated serially by n - 1 hinges [formula], with hinge Aj linking Bj and Bj + 1. From now on, hinge axes will be simply called hinges or axes and will refer to the corresponding codimension-two affine subspace of the chain configuration.

We assume that our abstract objects (bodies or panels) can move through one another. By identifying configurations which differ only by some rigid motion of the whole chain, the total configuration space is naturally parametrized by the (n - 1)-torus (S1)n - 1. We factor out these rigid motions by fixing the first object. This also fixes the first hinge. Clearly, a chain of hinged panels is simply a chain of hinged bodies subject to the condition that two consecutive hinge axes span only a codimension-one affine subspace (the corresponding panel).

To the last object, we may attach some frame (e.g. a point, or a Cartesian k-frame) or some flag (i.e. a sequence of linear subspaces, one included in the next), and study the end-frame or end-flag map which takes a configuration to its corresponding frame or flag position. Note that the target is itself a manifold (of frames or flags) and the resulting map is differentiable.

We study the singularities, or critical points of such maps, that is configurations corresponding to a drop in the rank of the differential. We obtain geometrical characterizations of these singularities (Theorems [\ref=thm:rank], [\ref=thm:plucker], [\ref=thm:confSpace], [\ref=thm:endFrame]) valid in arbitrary dimension d: they relate singular configurations to a lower dimensional span of the hinges in the corresponding projective Grassmann variety [formula]. The most intuitive case, which was known in Robotics [\cite=SDH] [\cite=Bur1] [\cite=Bur2], is the end-point map in dimension 3, illustrated below.

Consider a body-and-hinge chain in R3, with the first body fixed (i.e. identified with the ambient R3) and with a marked point e on the last body Bn, n > 3. Consider the end-point map:

[formula]

which registers, for a given configuration θ of the chain, the corresponding position e(θ) of the marked point in the ambient space R3.

Then, the the differential of this map:  de(θ) is of rank < 3 if and only if there's a line through the end-point e(θ) which is projectively incident with all the axes Ai(θ), i = 1,...,n - 1 of the corresponding configuration.

Projectively incident means intersecting in R3 or parallel, that is: intersecting 'at infinity' in the projective completion [formula].

It should be emphasized that the intervention of a projective characterization of singularities is no accident - indeed, it echoes the known "projective invariance of infinitesimal rigidity" in kinematics. See e.g. [\cite=Wun] [\cite=Weg].

We remark that, in dimension two, a body-and-hinge chain is as much as a panel-and-hinge chain, namely: a linkage given by n rigid bars connected serially by revolute joints. This is, in other words, a planar robot arm and the singularities of the end-point map are known to be precisely the configurations with all bars along the same line [\cite=Ha] [\cite=KM1], which indeed is the content of our result in dimension two. Thus, our hinge structures may be envisaged as higher dimensional versions of simple planar linkages. Although there is a conversion dictionary between a hinge-structure description and a linkage description in arbitrary dimension - as we outline in Section [\ref=sec:cyclesToLinkages], the former language seems better suited for characterizing singularities. We reinforce this aspect by discussing in Section [\ref=sec:platforms] a related case in kinematics: infinitesimally flexible platforms.

The results in this paper have been presented at the Eighth International Symposium on Effective Methods in Algebraic Geometry (MEGA) 2005, Porto Conte, Alghero, Sardinia, May 26-June 2, 2005.

The end-point map for body-and-hinge chains in Rd

Let B1,...,Bn denote d-dimensional bodies in Rd. To be precise, one should think of each Bi as a copy of Rd, free to move relative to the ambient Rd. One may attach a Cartesian frame to the copy and represent the movement of the body as the movement of the frame.

We put a hinge Aj between Bj and Bj + 1, j = 1,...,n - 1, that is: we distinguish a codimension-two affine subspace ( an axis) in Bj and one in Bj + 1, and we specify an isometry between them, and the two linked bodies are now supposed to be positioned in the ambient Rd subject to the condition that the two marked axes coincide, and realize the specified isometry. The common axis, as seen in the ambient Rd, or on each of the bodies so linked, will be denoted Aj.

We shall identify the first body with the ambient Rd, i.e. fix it as the reference body, because we are interested in configurations only up to a rigid motion of the assembled chain.

Clearly a hinge between two bodies allows one to rotate with respect to the other, with the hinge axis remaining pointwise fixed. This relative motion is parametrized by the unit circle S1. Thus, with B1 fixed, the configuration space of the chain of n hinged bodies is parametrized by (S1)n - 1.

We distinguish now some particular point of the last body in the chain:  e∈Bn - An - 1, and call it the end-point. (Obviously, we may assume e to be away from the last axis An - 1, since otherwise we would restrict considerations to n - 1 bodies.) This produces a map (to be denoted by e as well):

[formula]

which associates to a configuration θ, the position e(θ) of the end-point with respect to the ambient space i.e. B1. This will be our end-point map.

Our first concern is to describe the singularities of the end-point map, that is: the configurations θ∈(S1)n - 1 where the tangent map de(θ) has rank strictly less than its generic rank. We have:

rk(de(θ)) < d if and only if there's a line through e(θ) which is projectively incident with all the axes Ai(θ),i = 1,...,n - 1 of the corresponding configuration.

Note that A1(θ) = A1 is fixed, and the line through the end-point in the theorem is either intersecting an axis or parallel to it (i.e. meeting it "at infinity", when we complete Rd to the projective space Pd).

Proof: The image of the differential de(θ) is spanned by the tangent vectors at e(θ) to the circles (or circles degenerated to a point) described by the end-point e(θ) in the ambient Rd, when rotated around each axis Ai(θ).

This span is less than the full tangent space Rd at e(θ) if and only if there's a line ν through e(θ), normal to it. But ν, will then be projectively incident with all axes.

Indeed, if e(θ) happens to be on some axis, there's nothing to prove for that axis, while otherwise, ν must lie in the hyperplane spanned by the axis under consideration, say Ak(θ) and e(θ), which is the hyperplane normal to to the tangent at e(θ) for the circle described while rotating around Ak(θ). This is, essentially, a partial derivative at θ.

By the same elementary theorem, if a line ν passing through e(θ) is projectively incident with all axes, it will be normal to im(de(θ)).    [formula]

The space orthogonal to im(de(θ)) is swept by all lines through the end-point e(θ) which are projectively incident to all axes Ai(θ), i = 1,...,n - 1.

For n > d and a generic choice of hinge axes, the differential of the end-point map is generically onto, and its singularities are precisely the configurations which allow some line through the end-point to be projectively incident with all axes.

Remarks: i) The geometric argument used above does not even require to be specific about the parametrization of the configuration space by (S1)n - 1, e.g. what position is considered for θ = (0,..,0). It is enough to follow the infinitesimal displacements of the end-point resulting from rotating as one body the part of the chain from Bi on, around Ai - 1.

ii) This approach also shows that for infinitesimal considerations, the order of the axes may turn out to be irrelevant, while clearly essential otherwise.

iii) We have emphasized in our statements the purely projective characterization of the singularities. This is consistent with, in fact tantamount to the related phenomenon for linkages (cf. the so-called "projective invariance of infinitesimal rigidity" [\cite=Weg]).

For chains of hinged panels in R3, the line ν in the theorem must either pass through the projective intersection of the two axes of an intermediate panel, or be contained in it; and is always contained in the last panel.

k-frames in Rd and end-frame maps

We begin by reviewing a few facts about the homogeneous manifolds W(k,d) defined by all orthogonal (i.e. Cartesian) k-frames in Rd.

One such frame consists of a point in Rd (to be thought of as the origin of the frame) and k ordered unit vectors which are mutually orthogonal.

Clearly, for k = d, we can identify the manifold W(d,d) of all d-frames in Rd with the isometry group Isom(Rd) of Rd:

[formula]

where OR(d) stands for the real orthogonal group in dimension d, consisting of all orthogonal d  ×  d matrices. (The columns of an orthogonal matrix are the vectors of a d-frame.) The pair (t,M) gives the isometry:  x  ↦  Mx + t.

Suppose now 0  ≤  k  ≤  d, and note that one can parametrize all systems of k ordered, mutually orthogonal unit vectors in Rd by the homogeneous space OR(d) / OR(d - k) (where OR(d - k) is identified with the subgroup of OR(d) fixing the first k vectors in the standard basis). (These homogeneous spaces are called Stiefel manifolds.) This gives the general description:

[formula]

[formula]

Notice that there's a natural action of the group of isometries in dimension k:  Isom(Rk), on the space of k-frames in Rd:  W(k,d).

[formula]

A k-frame gives an identification of its span with Rk, and Isom(Rk) acts by displacing the given frame to the image of the standard basis. Thus the action preserves the k-plane spanned by a frame (through its origin), that is: a k-frame and its transforms have the same 'supporting' k-plane.

Let us fix a k-frame Ek in the last body Bn of a hinged chain. As in the case of a point e = E0, this gives an end-frame map:

[formula]

takig a configuration θ to the corresponding position of the end k-frame in the ambient Rd.

Again, for the singularities of the end-frame map, only the positions of the axes matter, not their ordering, and the remarks on the action of Isom(Rk) on W(k,d) give:

The singularities of the end-frame map:

[formula]

depend only on the set of axes and the k-plane spanned by the end-frame.

It may be useful in this context to cosider explicitly the map which takes a k-frame to the (affine) k-plane it spans in Rd, as a map to the Grassmann variety G(k + 1,d + 1) parametrizing all (k + 1) linear subspaces in Rd + 1, that is: all projective k-planes in Pd:

[formula]

The axes themselves can be seen as points in G(d - 1,d + 1)  ≈  G(2,d + 1), and our proposition says that the singularities of the end-frame map depend only on Ai(θ),i = 1,...,n - 1, and πk(Ek(θ)) as a point of (G(d - 1,d + 1)n - 1  /  Sn - 1)  ×  G(k + 1,d + 1).

In order to see what kind of geometrical characterization of singularities should emerge, we look in the next section at the case k = d - 2. A (d - 2)-frame on the last body may be interpreted as a 'loose hinge', or half a hinge, and if we prescribe its matching half i.e. a (d - 2)-frame in the ambient Rd (which is the first body), we may interpret the fibers of the end-frame map Ed - 2, as configuration spaces of cycles of n hinged bodies, for various placements of the closing hinge.

From chains to cycles

When we take k = d - 2, Proposition 2.1 says that the singularities of Ed - 2 depend on corresponding configurations of n points in the Grassmann variety G(d - 1,d + 1). Since the singularities of the map indicate singularities of the fibers, and the fibers, in this case, are cycles of n bodies with n hinges, we see that the order of the n points in the Grassmannian is not actually relevant.

We should add the remark that our set-up generalizes the case d = 2 of the planar 'robot arm' and planar polygon spaces [\cite=Ha] [\cite=KM1] [\cite=Bor2]. In that case, one has singularities if and only if all n axes (which are simply points in R2  ⊂  P2) are collinear. In general, we have:

Suppose [formula]. Consider the Plücker embedding of the Grassmann variety:

[formula]

The end-frame map for a chain of n hinged bodies in Rd:

[formula]

has a singularity at θ∈(S1)n - 1 if and only if the n points of G(d - 1,d + 1) corresponding to the axes Ai(θ), i = 1,...,n - 1 and the span πd - 2Ed - 2(θ) of the end-frame, all lie in some hyperplane section of the Grassmannian (in its Plücker embedding).

Note that:  [formula].

In terms of cycles, we have the simpler, but equivalent formulation:

The configuration space parametrizing the possible positions (up to Euclidean motions) of a cycle of [formula] hinged bodies in Rd is singular whenever the n axes, as points in

[formula]

span less than the whole ambient projective space of the Grassmannian.

Note that a generic (initial) position of the n axes gives a configuration space of dimension [formula].

Proof: We extend the argument presented by Bricard in Tome II, Note H of [\cite=Br2].

An infinitesimal motion of our chain of n hinged bodies in Rd corresponds with relative infinitesimal motions for each couple:

[formula]

which are all tangent to uniform rotations with axes A1,...,An.

A simple way to encode a uniform rotation around a codimension two axis Ai  ⊂  Rd uses an arbitrary point Mi∈Ai and an element [formula], where vi1,...,vid - 2 is a basis of the subspace Ai - Mi, whose exterior power ωi represents the angular velocity of the rotation.

The information (Mi,ωi), which generalizes the notion of sliding vector (vecteur glissant) in dimension three, can also be presented as an exterior vector:

[formula]

when we consider Rd as the affine subspace xd + 1 = 1 in Rd + 1 with the origin 0d = (0,...,0,1), so that ed + 1 = 0d + 10d. Thus uniform rotations become representatives for points in G(d - 1,d + 1) determined by their (affine) axes.

The component [formula] in Ti expresses the velocity of 0d∈Rd rotating with respect to Ai.

When we fix representatives [formula] for all axes Ai∈G(d - 1,d + 1), we have:  Ti  =  τiαi.

The result of the relative infinitesimal motions given by (Mi,ωi), i = 1,...,n on the corresponding couples (Bi + 1 / Bi) is clearly the identity when considered relative to one and the same body, say (B1 / B1). Thus, generalizing the null torsor condition in dimension three, we must have:

[formula]

Indeed, the resulting velocities must be zero at the origin 0d and elswhere:

[formula]

[formula]

The last condition gives:

[formula]

and (T) follows.

The dimension of the space of solutions (τi)i of equation (T) is n - rank(αi)i, hence: the configuration space has a singularity if and only if the axes span less than the whole ambient space of the Grassmannian.    [formula]

Remarks: In the generically rigid case for cycles, namely [formula], a singularity in the configuration space means infinitesimal flexibility.

In space (d = 3), we would have a cycle of 6 hinged bodies or panels. The case of 6 panels corresponds to the cyclo-hexane molecule, and when phrased in terms of linkages to 1-skeleta of octahedra. Thus, our result recovers characterizations of infinitesimal flexibility for objects of some long-standing interest [\cite=Br1], [\cite=Ben], [\cite=Br2]. A hyperplane section of the Grassmann-Plücker quadric G(2,4)  ⊂  P5 is also called a linear complex. A note of Darboux to Koenigs' 'Leons de cinématique', p.431, mentions a fact known to Chasles: a twisted cubic in P3 has all its tangents in the same linear complex i.e. a rational normal cubic has all its tangents in the same hyperplane section of the Grassmannian G(2,4).

Other examples of six lines in a linear complex come from Bricard's flexible octahedra. In particular, as observed in [\cite=Ben] (sect. 17), a six-cycle in R3 with hinges symmetric in pairs relative to an axis, has one degree of freedom of motion. To see that the hinges are linearly dependent in G(2,4)  ⊂  P5, note that the symmetry in a line, as a projective transformation T, can be given by a diagonal matrix with two + 1 and two - 1 eigenvalues, hence inducing an involution with two + 1 and four - 1 eigenvalues on [formula]. Thus [formula] are dependent.

End-frame and end-flag maps

Suppose 0  ≤  k  <  d - 2, and consider a k-frame attached to the last body of a chain. Clearly, any extension of this k-frame to a k + r-frame gives a factorization of the end-frame map Ek through Ek + r:

[formula]

The differential of the last arrow is surjective at all points, and it follows that the singularities of Ek are contained in the singularities of Ek + r, for any extension of the end-frame. This leads to:

Let 0  ≤  k  ≤  d - 2 and [formula].

The end-frame map for a chain of hinged bodies in Rd:

[formula]

has a differential of rank less than dim RW(k,d) at θ∈(S1)n - 1 if and only if, the n - 1 points of the Grassmann variety G(d - 1,d + 1) corresponding to the axes Ai(θ), i = 1,...,n - 1 and the locus made of πd - 2Ed - 2(θ) for all extensions of the k-frame Ek(θ) to a (d - 2)-frame Ed - 2(θ), are contained in some hyperplane section of the Grassmannian (in its Plücker embedding).

For a generic initial position θ = 0 of the axes and the end-frame:

[formula]

This statement shows that one may replace frames with flags (which is, in fact, the natural thing to do from the complex point of view), and consider the singularities of the end-flag map:

[formula]

obtained by composition with W(k,d)  →  Fl(k,d), which associates to an orthogonal frame Ek  =  {e0,e1,...,ek} the projective flag in [formula] made of subspaces spanned by the first m elements in the frame, with 0  ≤  m  ≤  k.

Proof:  We use the shorter notation Isom(Rk) = E(k). Lie algebras will be denoted with corresponding small case letters. Using the homogeneous space description:

[formula]

we may identify the tangent space to W(k,d) at Ek(θ) with e(d) / o(d - k).

As in our argument for Theorem 1., the image of the tangent map at θ is spanned by the (n - 1) tangent vectors corresponding to rotations around each axis (with the rest of the chain imagined as rigid, from that axis on). These vectors are represented in e(d) by the corresponding infinitesimal rotations.

They do not span the whole tangent space e(d) / o(d - k) precisely when there's a linear functional on e(d), vanishing on o(d - k) and all the (n - 1) infinitesimal rotations.

The theorem then is simply the reading of this statement when converted via the linear isomorphism

[formula]

and the natural identification of skew-symmetric two-forms (in (d + 1) variables) with (d - 1) exterior vectors:  [formula]. Indeed, an infinitesimal rotation around a codimension-two axis corresponds precisely with the exterior vector representing the axis as a point of the Grassmanniann G(d - 1,d + 1).

Converting cycles into linkages

In this section we describe (canonical) procedures for associating linkages with 2n vertices and (2d - 1)n edges in Rd to generic cycles of n hinged bodies in Rd, d  ≥  3. This association will permit the identification of the cycle configuration space with corresponding components of the linkage configuration space.

The indices for axes and bodies should be understood cyclically i.e. modulo n.

We need to distinguish between the case of odd and even dimension.

Suppose d is odd, that is: d = 2k + 1. In the generic case, all intersections of k consecutive axes are lines.

[formula]

One should regard li as part of Ai (and moving with it as the cycle deforms into other configurations).

We choose two points in general position on each of these n lines. This gives exactly 2k points on each axis, and exactly 2k + 2 points on any pair of consecutive axes, which corresponds to a body. Thus, the d-simplex generated by the 2k + 2 points marks the body, and we take as edges in our linkage all edges belonging to one of these n simplices. A final count gives (2d - 1)n edges.

Remark: There is, in fact, a canonical way to choose two points on each of the above lines. Indeed, for every pair of consecutive lines, there's a unique common perpendicular incident to both, and this gives one point on each line in the pair. In the end, one has two points on each line.

Suppose now d even, that is: d = 2k. In the generic case, all intersections of k consecutive axes are points:

[formula]

We consider these n points pi, together with n points chosen generically, one in each intersection of k - 1 consecutive axes:

[formula]

This gives exactly 2k - 1 points in each axis, and 2k + 1 points in any pair of two consecutive axes. As in the odd case, this leads to a linkage with 2n vertices and (2d - 1)n edges which is the 1-skeleton of a complex consisting of n simplices of dimension d which share cyclically, one with the next, a (d - 2)-face.

Remark: Again, the generic case allows for a canonical choice of the points qi. Indeed, one may define qi as the orthogonal projection of pi + 1 on the plane [formula].

For more definiteness, we recall the notions of configuration space envisaged here for cycles of hinged bodies, respectively linkages.

For cycles, we consider an initial position of axes Ai = Ai(0)  ⊂  Rd, i = 1,...,n. Every pair of consecutive axes (Ai,Ai + 1) belongs to a rigid body Bi + 1, understood as a copy of Rd. Bi + 1 can move relative to Bi by rotating with respect to the common axis Ai. We consider B1 identified with the ambient Rd, fix a (d - 2)-frame in An, and define the configuration space C(A1,...,An) for our initial position θ = 0 as the fiber of the end-frame map Ed - 2 over the initial position Ed - 2(0). (See sections 2 and 3 above.) In formulae:

[formula]

with Ed - 2(0)  a  (d - 2)-frame in An = An(0), and:

[formula]

The configuration space so defined is (up to canonical identifications) independent of the end-frame chosen in An, or a cyclic permutation of the indices.

Our results in section 3 imply that, for a generic initial position, the configuration space will be a smooth submanifold of (S1)n - 1, of dimension [formula]. However, this submanifold might have several connected components.

We turn now to linkages. A linkage L is a weighted graph, with weights indicating the length ascribed to each edge. A realization of L in Rd is a map from the vertex set of L to Rd, such that any two vertices defining an edge are placed at the distance required by its weight. The configuration space C(L) = C(L,d) of L in Rd is the space of all realizations of L in Rd, modulo Euclidean motions (i.e. orintation preserving isometries of Rd). Cf.[\cite=Bor1] [\cite=B-S].

In order to emphasize the fact that our canonical procedure for converting (generic) cycles into linkages is independent of the representative chosen in describing the configuration space C(A1,...,An), one can use the following:

Let A = (Ai)i,A' = (A'i)i denote two configurations in C(A) = C(A1,...,An) = C(A'), with canonically associated linkages L(A) and L(A'). Then:

[formula]

This means that their graphs can be identified, and the length ascribed to corresponding edges is the same.

Proof: The graphs, in our case, are clearly the same: 1-skeleta of identically labeled simplicial complexes. Thus, one has to verify only the edge-length matching.

To see this, we consider the simplices in the canonical realization of L(A) as markers for the n bodies Bi. Imagining the cycle A unhinged at An (but with the (d - 2) simplicial face marked on both B1 and Bn - the equivalent of a (d - 2)-frame), there is a continuous deformation of the chain (by some trajectory in (S1)n - 1 linking A to A') which ends-up as A' by matching again the two marked (d - 2) simplicial faces in B1 and Bn. But this restores perforce all the incidences (and orthogonalities) defining the canonical realization of L(A') as incidences (and orthogonalities) of the moved simplices of L(A).    [formula]

Note:  The argument shows a little more: the corresponding simplices are not only congruent, but realized with the same orientation. In fact, the linkage configuration space C(L(A)) does contain realizations with one or the other orientation for some of the simplices in the underlying complex, and our inclusion C(A)  ⊂  C(L(A)) covers only those components where all orientations are as given in the canonical realization associated to A. Denoting this image by C(L(A)c), we obtain a diagram:

[formula]

where, considering the first body B1 as fixed, and the corresponding simplex with (d + 1) vertices in L(A) fixed as well, the last column records the axes A2(θ),...,An - 1(θ), respectively the remaining 2n - (d + 1) vertices placed in Rd  ⊂  Pd, and their relation through a (generically defined) rational map.

Let A be a generic n-cycle in Rd with axes A1,...,An. For An + 1  ≠  An sufficiently close to An, we have:

[formula]

This is the analogon of "a small cut at a vertex" for polygon spaces. The proof, as in that case, amounts to observing that the fibers of the end-frame map:

[formula]

over a small neighborhood of Ed - 2(0) can be identified with C(A1,...,An) = E- 1d - 2(Ed - 2(0).    [formula]

Cycle invariants: moduli

When we look at n-cycles as points in G(d - 1,d + 1)n modulo the diagonal action of the group of Euclidean motions in Rd, we have a parameter space of dimension [formula] containing cycle configuration spaces of generic dimension [formula]. Thus, a parameter space for the cycle configuration spaces, that is: a moduli space, should have dimension (2d - 3)n. In other words, we expect (2d - 3)n continuous parameters (also called invariants or moduli), to characterize a generic configuration space, at least up to a finite number of possibilities.

Example:  For the planar case (d = 2), with n-cycles understood as n-gons with prescribed edges, the obvious invariants are the edge lengths themselves. The admissible edge-length-vectors make-up a polyhedreal cone in Rn (with section a second hypersimplex). The various topological types for planar polygon configuration spaces are then described in terms of a subdivision into chambers of this cone. [\cite=Bor2] [\cite=Ha] [\cite=KM1] [\cite=N]

According to the previous section, the canonical linkage L(A) associated to a generic cycle A = (A1,...,An)∈C(A) may be envisaged as an invariant of the cycle configuration space in dimension d  ≥  3. This gives, upfront, (2d - 1)n edge lengths, but we have a number of orthogonalities in all canonical realizations, which make 2n distances dependent on the remaining (2d - 3)n. Thus, one obtains (2d - 3)n invariants. However, the cone they determine in R(2d - 3)n is more complicated than in the planar case.

Obviously rescaling does not change the structure of the configuration spaces, and we may replace the cone with a transversal section of dimension (2d - 3)n - 1, corresponding to ratios of invariants.

Platforms

In this section we present a complementary result in kinematics, meant to emphasize the fact that line geometry (or dually, axis geometry), that is: the use of Grassmann varieties G(2,d + 1)  ≈  G(d - 1,d + 1), provides a natural context for singularity issues.

Our example may be envisaged as a generalization of a theorem of Desargues, form the 'perspective' of 'platforms'. For background on infinitesimal rigidity we refer to [\cite=B-S] and [\cite=Weg].

A platform in Rd consists of two (rigid) bodies connected by [formula] rigid bars with ends pij on one body, respectively qij on the other. For d = 2 we connect the vertices of two triangles with three bars, and the resulting framework is infinitesimally flexible precisely when the triangles are in perspective for the given pairing of vertices: in other words, they produce a Desargues configuration. This generalizes to:

A platform in dimension d is infinitesimally flexible if and only if the [formula] lines defined by the connecting bars pijqij lie in a hyperplane section of the Grassmannian [formula].

Proof; We use a 'projective' version of the paltform, by imagining Rd as x0 = 1 in Rd + 1 and the origin linked by bars to pij and qij. We may consider the first body fixed, and the infinitesimal motion of the second given by an anti-symmetric (d + 1)  ×  (d + 1) matrix A. An infinitesimal motion of the platform requires:

[formula]

and this linear system in the unknowns aij has a non-trivial solution precisely when the exterior two-vectors:  [formula], 1  ≤  i < j  ≤  (d + 1) are linearly dependent.    [formula]

Remark: For the 'Stewart-Gough platform' i.e. d = 3, this fact is presented in [\cite=RV], following [\cite=Mer].

Conclusions

In principle, understanding the singularities of a map offers a key towards the topology of its fibers (usually via some Morse theory), and this approach is common to a number of studies on mechanical linkages [\cite=N] [\cite=Ha] [\cite=KM1] [\cite=KM2] [\cite=Bor2].

One should also remark that, with configuration spaces of this nature, all relevant maps are algebraic, and this allows the intervention of complex algebraic-geometry, as in [\cite=Kly] [\cite=Bor2].
