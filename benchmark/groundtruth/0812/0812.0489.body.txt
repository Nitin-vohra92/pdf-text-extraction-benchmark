Building suitable sets for locally compact groups by means of continuous selections

Dedicated to the memory of Jan Pelant

All topological groups considered in this paper are assumed to be Hausdorff, and all topological spaces are assumed to be Tychonoff.

Motivating background

Let G be a group. We use 1G to denote the identity element of G. If X is a subset of G, then [formula] will denote the smallest subgroup of G containing X, and we say that X (algebraically) generates [formula].

[\cite=D] [\cite=mel] [\cite=HM] A subset X of a topological group G is called a suitable set for G provided that:

X is discrete,

[formula] is closed in G,

[formula] is dense in G.

Suitable sets were considered first in the early sixties by Tate in the framework of Galois cohomology (see [\cite=D]). Tate proved that every profinite group has a suitable set. This result has later been proved also by Mel'nikov [\cite=mel]. Later on, Hofmann and Morris discovered the following fundamental theorem:

[\cite=HM] Every locally compact group has a suitable set.

Let us briefly outline main points of the proof from [\cite=HM]. The authors first prove the existence of suitable sets in compact connected Abelian groups. This is accomplished by using the full strength of the theory of free compact Abelian groups [\cite=HM1]. The theorem for compact connected groups then follows from the Abelian compact connected case and the result of Kuranishi [\cite=ku] that every compact connected simple group has a dense subgroup generated by two elements. Since compact totally disconnected groups have suitable sets by the results of Tate and Mel'nikov (cited above), the authors of [\cite=HM] then combine connected and totally disconnected cases together to get the conclusion for all compact groups by deploying a theorem of Lee [\cite=Lee]: Every compact group G contains a closed totally disconnected subgroup K such that G = c(G)  ·  K, where c(G) is the connected component of G. Having proved the result in compact case, Hofmann and Morris then proceed to deduce the general case from the compact case using some structure theorems for locally compact groups.

The main purpose of this article is to offer a direct, self-contained, purely topological proof of Theorem [\ref=Hofmann-Morris:theorem] based on Michael's selection theorem. Our proof is in the spirit of [\cite=Uspenskii] [\cite=Sh], and uses only elementary facts from (topological) group theory.

Theorem [\ref=Hofmann-Morris:theorem] allowed Hofmann and Morris [\cite=HM] to introduce the generating rank

[formula]

of a locally compact group G. (For profinite groups, s(G) has been already defined by Mel'nikov [\cite=mel].) As witnessed by the fact that the whole Chapter 12 of the monograph [\cite=HMbook] by Hofmann and Morris is devoted to the study of this cardinal function (and its relation to the weight), s(G) is undoubtedly one of the most important cardinal invariants of a (locally) compact group G.

Let G be a topological group. Following [\cite=DS] define the topologically generating weight tgw(G) of G by

[formula]

where w(X) =  min {|B|:B is a base of X}  +  ω is the weight of a space X. The two principle results of [\cite=DS] are summarized in the following

Let G be a compact group. Then:

tgw(G) = s(G) whenever s(G) is infinite, and

[formula], where c(G) is the connected component of G and [formula] is defined to be the smallest infinite cardinal κ such that κω  ≥  τ.

The proof of this theorem in [\cite=DS] is essentially topological and completely self-contained with the only exception of Theorem [\ref=Hofmann-Morris:theorem] which is still necessary. Our present manuscript completes the job started in [\cite=DS] by providing a self-contained, purely topological proof of Theorem [\ref=Hofmann-Morris:theorem]. It is worth mentioning that in [\cite=DS] Theorem [\ref=TGW:theorem] has been used to deduce (as straightforward corollaries) a series of major results from Chapter 12 of the monograph [\cite=HMbook] by Hofmann and Morris.

Necessary facts

In this section we collect (mostly) well-known facts that will be used in the proof.

Recall that a map f:X  →  Y is:

(i) open provided that f(U) is open in Y for every open subset U of X,

(ii) closed provided that f(F) is closed in Y for every closed subset F of X,

(iii) perfect if f is a closed map and f- 1(y) is compact for every y∈Y.

[\cite=Engelking] Assume that f:X  →  Y and g:Y  →  Z are continuous surjections and the map [formula] is perfect. Then g is also perfect.

For every i∈I let fi:X  →  Yi be a map. The diagonal product [formula] of the family {fi:i∈I} is a map [formula] which assigns to every x∈X the point {fi(x)}i∈I of the Cartesian product [formula]. (More precisely, f assigns to each x∈X the point [formula] defined by f(x)(i) = fi(x) for all i∈I.)

[\cite=Engelking] For every i∈I let fi:X  →  Yi be a continuous perfect map. Then the diagonal product [formula] is also a continuous perfect map.

[\cite=HR] If N is a compact normal subgroup of a topological group G, then the quotient map from G onto its quotient group G / N is perfect.

Let π:G  →  H be a continuous group homomorphism from a topological group G onto a topological group H. If π is a quotient map, then π is also an open map. In particular, if π is a perfect map, then π is an open map.

The first statement follows from [\cite=HR]. To prove the second statement note that a prefect map is a closed map, and every closed map is a quotient map [\cite=Engelking].

[\cite=HR] A locally compact subgroup G of a topological group H is closed in H.

Recall that a topological group G is compactly generated provided that there exists a compact subset K of G such that [formula].

[\cite=KakutaniKodaira] If U is an open subset of a compactly generated, locally compact group G, then there exists a compact normal subgroup N  ⊆  U of G such that G / N has a countable base.

We note that in [\cite=HR] one finds a purely topological, elementary proof of Fact [\ref=separable:metric:quotient] that does not use the structure theory of locally compact groups.

If D is an infinite set, then [formula] will denote the one-point compactification of the discrete set of size |D|. (Here [formula].) That is, all points of D are isolated in S(D), and the family [formula] is a finite subset of D} consists of open neighbourhoods of a single non-isolated point *  .

Note that S(D) can be characterized as a compact Hausdorff space of size |D| having precisely one non-isolated point. The relevance of this space to our topic can be seen from the following folklore

If X is an infinite suitable set for a compact group G, then the subspace [formula] of G is compact and homeomorphic to the space S(X).

Indeed, [formula] is closed in G by item (ii) of Definition [\ref=suitable:set:definition]. Since G is compact, so is [formula]. Since X is an infinite discrete subset of G by item (i) of Definition [\ref=suitable:set:definition], the point 1G cannot be isolated in [formula] (otherwise [formula] would become an infinite discrete compact space). Hence, [formula] is a compact space with a single non-isolated point 1G, and thus [formula] is homeomorphic to S(X).

Assume that X is a compact space with a single non-isolated point x and f:X  →  Y is a continuous surjection of X onto an infinite space Y. Then Y is a compact space with a single non-isolated point f(x).

We are going to show first that [formula] is finite for every open subset V of Y containing f(x). Indeed, since f:X  →  Y is continuous, U = f- 1(V) is an open subset of X containing x. Since every point of X different from x is isolated, [formula] consists of isolated points of X. Since X is compact, we conclude that the set [formula] is finite. Therefore, the set [formula] must be finite as well. Since Y is an infinite set, V must be infinite. Thus, f(x) is a non-isolated point of Y.

Let us show next that Y is compact. Let V be an open cover of Y. There exists V∈V such that f(x)∈V. For every [formula] choose Vy∈V with y∈Vy. Now [formula] is a finite subcover of V.

Finally, let [formula]. Since Y is Hausdorff, there exist open subsets W and V of Y such that y∈W, f(x)∈V and [formula]. Then [formula], and hence W is finite. Since every singleton is a closed subset of Y, it now follows that y is an isolated point of Y.

Our next lemma, which is in a certain sense the "converse" of Fact [\ref=fact11], is the key to building suitable sets in (compact-like) topological groups.

Suppose that G is a topological group, X is an infinite set and f:S(X)  →  G is a continuous map such that f( * ) = 1G and [formula] is dense in G. Then [formula] is a suitable set for G such that [formula] is compact.

Suppose first that f(S(X)) is a finite set. Then S is discrete, [formula] is compact and closed (being finite), and [formula] is dense in G. Therefore, S is a suitable set for G.

Assume now that f(S(X)) is infinite. As an infinite continuous image of the compact space S(X) with a single non-isolated point *  , the space f(S(X)) is also a compact space with a single non-isolated point f( * ) = 1G (Fact [\ref=fact12]). Therefore, [formula] is a discrete set and [formula] is compact (and thus closed in G). Moreover, [formula]. Since the latter set is dense in G, we conclude that S is a suitable set for G.

Note that [formula] is (homeomorphic to) a non-trivial convergence sequence together with its limit. The next fact is a key ingredient in our proof, so to make our manuscript self-contained we include its proof adapted from [\cite=FSh].

[\cite=FSh] Let G be a compactly generated metric group. Then there exists a continuous map [formula] such that f( * ) = 1G and [formula] is dense in G.

Fix a local base [formula] at 1G such that V0 = G and Vn + 1  ⊆  Vn for all [formula]. Let [formula], where K is a compact subset of G. One can easily see that G is separable, so let [formula] be a countable dense subset of G.

Fix [formula]. Since {xVn + 1:x∈G} is an open cover of G and K is a compact subset of G, [formula] for some finite set Fn. Now we have

[formula]

By induction on n we will define a sequence [formula] of finite subsets of G with the following properties:

(in) En  ⊆  Vn,

(iin) [formula], and

(iiin) [formula].

To begin with, note that the set [formula] satisfies all three conditions (i0)-(iii0). Suppose that we have already defined finite sets E0,E1,, En - 1 such that conditions (i0), [formula], (in - 1), (ii0), [formula], (iin - 1) and (iii0), [formula], (iiin - 1) are satisfied. Condition (iin - 1) implies that

[formula]

and since Fn is finite, we can find a finite set En  ⊆  Vn such that

[formula]

Conditions (in) and (iiin) are clear, and (iin) follows from ([\ref=EQ:1]) and ([\ref=EQ:2]).

From (in) for [formula] it follows that the set [formula] forms a sequence converging to 1G. Since (iiin) holds for every [formula], we get [formula], and so [formula] is dense in G. Now take any bijection [formula] and define also f( * ) = 1G.

Recall that a set-valued map is a map F:Y  →  Z which assigns to every point y∈Y a non-empty closed subset F(y) of Z. This set-valued map is lower semicontinuous if [formula] is open in Y for every open subset U of Z. A (single-valued) map f:Y  →  Z is called a selection of F provided that f(y)∈F(y) for all y∈Y.

We finish this section with the following special case of Michael's selection theorem [\cite=Michael] (see also [\cite=RS]).

A lower semicontinuous set-valued map F:Y  →  Z from a zero-dimensional (para)compact space Y to a complete metric space Z has a continuous selection f:Y  →  Z.

Lifting lemmas based on Michael's selection theorem

Suppose that K0,K1 are topological groups, N is a subgroup of the product K0  ×  K1, and for each i = 0,1 let [formula] be the restriction to N of the projection pi:K0  ×  K1  →  Ki onto the ith coordinate. Assume also that:

Ki = pi(N) for each i = 0,1,

q0 is an open map,

q1 is a closed map,

K1 is a compete metric space,

Y is a (para)compact zero-dimensional space and h:Y  →  K0 is a continuous map.

Then there exists a continuous map g:Y  →  N such that [formula].

For y∈Y define F(y) = {z∈K1:(h(y),z)∈N}. Note that [formula] is a closed subset of N, and so the set [formula] must be closed in q1(N) = p1(N) = K1 by (1) and (3). Since h(y)∈K0 = p0(N) by (1) and (5), it follows that [formula]. Therefore F:Y  →  K1 is a set-valued map.

We claim that F is lower semicontinuous. Indeed, let U be an open subset of K1. Since [formula] is an open subset of N, [formula] is an open subset of q0(N) = p0(N) = K0 by (1) and (2). Since h:Y  →  K0 is a continuous map by (5), [formula] is an open subset of Y. Now note that [formula] by definitions of F and V.

In view of (4), the assumptions of Fact [\ref=michael:selection:theorem] are satisfied if one takes K1 as Z. Let f:Y  →  K1 be a (single-valued) continuous selection of F which exists by the conclusion of Fact [\ref=michael:selection:theorem].

Define g:Y  →  K0  ×  K1 by g(y) = (h(y),f(y)) for y∈Y. Since both h and f are continuous, so is g. If y∈Y, then g(y) = (h(y),f(y))∈{h(y)}  ×  F(y) because f is a selection of F, which yields g(y)∈N by the definition of F(y). Therefore, g(Y)  ⊆  N. The equality [formula] is obvious from our definition of g.

In the sequel we will only need a particular case when the previous lemma is applicable:

Suppose that G is a locally compact group, K0 is a topological group, K1 is a metric group, χi:G  →  Ki is a continuous group homomorphism for i = 0,1, [formula] is the diagonal product of maps χ0 and χ1, and N = χ(G). Assume also that:

Ki  =  χi(G) for each i = 0,1,

each χi is a perfect map,

Y is a (para)compact zero-dimensional space and h:Y  →  K0 is a continuous map.

Then there exists a continuous map g:Y  →  N such that [formula], where [formula] is the restriction to N of the projection p0:K0  ×  K1  →  K0.

It suffices to check that N, Y and h satisfy all the assumptions of Lemma [\ref=selection:lemma]. (1) follows from (a). Let i = 0,1. Since both χ:G  →  N and qi:N  →  Ki are surjections, [formula] and χi is a perfect map by item (b), qi is a perfect map (Fact [\ref=perfect:is:divisible]), and so also an open map (Fact [\ref=quotient:implies:open]). This yields both (2) and (3). Being an open continuous image of a locally compact space G, K1 is locally compact. Since a locally compact metric space admits a complete metric, we get (4). Finally, (5) coincides with (c). Now the conclusion of our lemma follows from the conclusion of Lemma [\ref=selection:lemma].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=Hofmann-Morris:theorem]

If G and H are groups and f:G  →  H is a group homomorphism, then ker f = {x∈G:f(x) = 1H} denotes the kernel of f. Obviously, ker f is a normal subgroup of G.

We are now ready to prove a specific version of Theorem [\ref=Hofmann-Morris:theorem]. Our proof is based on representing a compactly generated, locally compact group as a limit of some inverse spectra (aka a projective limit in the terminology of algebraists) of locally compact separable metric groups. In order to make an exposition easier to comprehend for readers not familiar with inverse (aka projective) limits, we have chosen the presentation using diagonal products of maps, thereby allowing for a much simpler visualiziation of such a limit.

Let G be a topological group generated by its open subset with compact closure. Then G has a suitable set S such that [formula] is compact.

Fix a local base {Uα:α  <  τ} at 1G. If τ  ≤  ω, then G is a compactly generated metric group, and hence G has the desired suitable set by Fact [\ref=Fujita:Sh] and Lemma [\ref=building:suitable:sets].

From now on we will assume that τ  ≥  ω1. Let X be a set with |X| = τ. For every ordinal α  <  τ, apply Fact [\ref=separable:metric:quotient] to choose a compact normal subgroup Nα of G such that Nα  ⊆  Uα and Hα = G / Nα has a countable base, and let ψα:G  →  Hα be the quotient map. For every ordinal α satisfying 1  ≤  α  ≤  τ define [formula] and Gα  =  φα(G). For 1  ≤  β  ≤  α  ≤  τ let [formula] be the natural projection, and define [formula] to be the restriction of ϖαβ to [formula]. Note that παβ is a surjection. By our construction,

[formula]

φα is a perfect map for every α with 1  ≤  α  ≤  τ.

Each ψβ is a perfect map by Fact [\ref=quotients:with:respect:to:compact:group:are:perfect], so the map [formula] is also perfect by Fact [\ref=diagonal:of:perfect:maps].

By transfinite recursion on α, for every ordinal α satisfying 1  ≤  α  ≤  τ we will define a continuous map fα:S(X)  →  Gα satisfying the following properties:

[formula] whenever 1  ≤  β  <  α,

fα( * ) = 1Gα,

|{x∈X:fα(x)  ≠  1Gα}|  ≤  ω  ·  |α|,

[formula] is dense in Gα.

To motivate these conditions, we mention that (iiα) and (ivα) guarantee that [formula] is a suitable set for Gα (Lemma [\ref=building:suitable:sets]). The other two conditions (iα) and (iiiα) are technical and needed only for carrying out the recursion construction.

We start our recursion with α = 1. First of all note that φ1  =  ψ0 and G1 = H0. Being a continuous homomorphic image of a compactly generated group G, G1 itself is compactly generated. Let N be a countable subset of X. Since S(N) and [formula] are homeomorphic, applying Fact [\ref=Fujita:Sh] we can find a continuous map f:S(N)  →  G1 such that f( * ) = 1G1 and [formula] is dense in G1. We extend this map to the continuous map f1:S(X)  →  G1 by defining f1(x) = 1G1 for every [formula] and f1(y) = f(y) for y∈S(N). Now note that f1 satisfies properties (i1)-(iv1).

Suppose now that α is an ordinal with 1 < α  ≤  τ. Assume also that a continuous map fβ:S(X)  →  Gβ satisfying properties (iβ)-(ivβ) has been already defined for every ordinal β such that 1  ≤  β  <  α. We are going to define a continuous map fα:S(X)  →  Gα satisfying properties (iα)-(ivα). As usual, we consider two cases.

Case 1. α  =  β + 1 is a successor ordinal. Clearly, a subspace

[formula]

of S(X) is closed in S(X). Hence, Yβ is a compact space with at most one non-isolated point. In particular, Yβ is zero-dimensional.

We claim that K0 = Gβ, K1 = Hβ, χ0  =  φβ, χ1  =  ψβ, N = Gα, Y = Yβ and [formula] satisfy the assumptions of Lemma [\ref=main:lemma]. Indeed, [formula], and so N = Gα  =  φα(G) = χ(G). (a) holds trivially. The map χ0  =  φβ is perfect by Claim [\ref=phi:are:perfect], while χ1  =  ψβ is a perfect map by Fact [\ref=quotients:with:respect:to:compact:group:are:perfect]. This proves (b). Since fβ is a continuous map, so is [formula]. Thus establishes (c).

Let g:Yβ  →  Gα be a continuous map satisfying [formula] which exists according to the conclusion of Lemma [\ref=main:lemma]. Define g':Yβ  →  Gα by g'(y) = g(y)  ·  g( * )- 1 for y∈Yβ. Clearly, g' is a continuous map and g'( * ) = 1Gα. If y∈Yβ, then [formula] by (iiβ), and so

[formula]

because παβ is a group homomorphism. This gives

[formula]

Since β  ≥  1, from ([\ref=eq:0]) we have ker παβ  =  φα( ker φβ)  ⊆  φα( ker ψ0)  ⊆  φα(N0). Since N0 is compact, so is φα(N0). Being a closed subspace of φα(N0), ker παβ must be compact. Since ker παβ  ⊆  {1Gβ}  ×  Hβ and Hβ has a countable base, ker παβ is a compact metric group.

Note that |Yβ|  ≤  ω  ·  |β| < τ by (iiiβ), and since τ  ≥  ω1, we can choose a countable set Zβ  ⊆  X with [formula]. Since [formula] is naturally homeomorphic to [formula], Fact [\ref=Fujita:Sh] allows us to find a continuous map [formula] such that θ( * ) = 1Gα and [formula] is dense in ker παβ.

Now define the map fα:S(X)  →  Gα by

[formula]

Since both g' and θ are continuous maps, one can easily check that the map fα is continuous as well.

[formula].

If y∈Yβ, then [formula] by ([\ref=g:prime]).

Suppose now that [formula]. We claim that παβ(x) = 1Gβ. Indeed, if x∈Zβ, then παβ(fα(x)) = παβ(θ(x)) = 1Gβ because θ(x)∈θ(Zβ)  ⊆   ker παβ. If [formula], then fα(x) = 1Gα, and so παβ(fα(x)) = παβ(1Gα) = 1Gβ. Finally, ([\ref=Y:beta]) and (iiβ) yields fβ(x) = 1Gβ  =  παβ(fα(x)) for [formula].

Let us check now conditions (iα)-(ivα).

(iα) Suppose that 1  ≤  γ  <  α  =  β + 1. If γ  =  β, then Claim [\ref=alpha:beta] applies. Suppose now that 1  ≤  γ  <  β. Then [formula] by ([\ref=eq:0]), Claim [\ref=alpha:beta] and (iβ).

(iiα) fα( * ) = g'( * ) = 1Gα.

(iiiα) From the definition of fα one has [formula], and so |{x∈X:fα(x)  ≠  1Gα}|  ≤  |Yβ|  ·  |Zβ|  ≤  ω  ·  |β|  ·  ω  ≤  ω  ·  |α| by (iiiβ).

(ivα) Let F be the closure of [formula] in Gα. We need to show that F = Gα. Observe that [formula]. Since [formula] is dense in ker παβ, it now follows that ker παβ  ⊆  F. Since both φα and παβ are surjections and [formula] is a perfect map by ([\ref=eq:0]) and Claim [\ref=phi:are:perfect], Fact [\ref=perfect:is:divisible] allows us to conclude that παβ is a perfect (and hence also closed) map. Therefore, παβ(F) is a closed subset of Gβ. From (iα) one gets παβ(fα(S(X))) = fβ(S(X)), and since παβ is a group homomorphism, one also has [formula]. According to (ivβ), the set [formula] is dense in Gβ, and since παβ(F) is closed in Gβ, this yields παβ(F) = Gβ. Since F is a subgroup of Gα satisfying both ker παβ  ⊆  F and παβ(F) = Gβ  =  παβ(Gα), one obtains F = Gα.

Case 2. α is a limit ordinal. Define

[formula]

Suppose that H  ⊆  Lα and [formula] is dense in Gβ whenever 1  ≤  β  <  α. Then H is dense in Lα. the inverse limit

[formula]

of the inverse spectrum {Gα,πβγ,1  ≤  γ  ≤  β  <  α}.

Let U be an open subset of the product [formula] such that [formula]. Pick arbitrarily [formula]. There exist n∈ω, pairwise distinct ordinals [formula] and an open subset Vi of Hγi for every i  ≤  n such that g(γi)∈Vi for all i  ≤  n and

[formula]

Since α is a limit ordinal, β  =   max {γi:i  ≤  n} + 1 < α. Note that

[formula]

is an open subset of [formula] and [formula]. Since g∈Lα, one has [formula] by ([\ref=def:L]). It follows that [formula]. By the assumption of our claim, there exists some h∈H such that [formula]. Now from ([\ref=eq:1]), ([\ref=eq:2]) and the choice of β we get h∈U. Thus [formula]. there exist an ordinal β with 1  ≤  β  <  α and an open subset V of Gβ such that g(β)∈V and π- 1β(V)  ⊆  U, where [formula] is the projection on βth coordinate. Since [formula] and φβ(X) is dense in Gβ, there exists x∈X such that φβ(x)∈V. Define [formula] by h(γ) = φγ(x) whenever 1  ≤  γ  <  α.

Gα  ⊆  Lα and Gα is dense in Lα.

Let h∈Gα. Then h = φα(g) for some g∈G. For every ordinal β satisfying 1  ≤  β  <  α one has [formula], which yields h∈Lα by ([\ref=def:L]). Thus, Gα  ⊆  Lα.

Assume that β is an ordinal satisfying 1  ≤  β  <  α. Let h'∈Gβ. Then h' = φβ(g) for some g∈G. Now h = φα(g)∈Gα and [formula]. This yields [formula]. The converse inclusion [formula] is trivial. This shows that [formula].

Therefore, Gα (taken as H) satisfies the assumptions of Caim [\ref=dense:claim], so Gα must be dense in Lα by the conclusion of this claim.

Gα = Lα.

The map φα is open by Claim [\ref=phi:are:perfect] and Fact [\ref=quotient:implies:open]. As an open continuous image of a locally compact group G, the group Gα  =  φα(G) is also locally compact. Since Lα is a topological group containing Gα (Claim [\ref=G:alpha:denseness]), Gα must be closed in Lα (Fact [\ref=locally:compact:subgroups:are:closed]). Since Gα is also dense in Lα (Claim [\ref=G:alpha:denseness]), the conclusion of our claim follows.

We are now ready to define fα:S(X)  →  Gα. Let x∈S(X) be arbitrary. Since (iβ) holds for every ordinal β satisfying 1  ≤  β  <  α, there exists a unique hx∈Lα such that [formula] for all β with 1  ≤  β  <  α. Now hx∈Gα by Claim [\ref=G:and:L:coincide], and so we can define fα(x) to be this unique hx.

Let us check now conditions (iα)-(ivα). Condition (iα) clearly holds. Since each fβ is a continuous map, so is fα. (iiβ) for 1  ≤  β  <  α trivially implies (iiα). Similarly, (iiiβ) for 1  ≤  β  <  α yields (iiiα). To check (ivα) it suffices to show, in view of Claim [\ref=G:and:L:coincide], that [formula] satisfies the assumptions of Claim [\ref=dense:claim]. Indeed, assume 1  ≤  β  <  α. Since παβ is a group homomorphism, from (iα) one has

[formula]

and the latter set is dense in Gβ by (ivβ).

The recursive construction has been complete.

According to (iiτ), we have fτ( * ) = 1Gτ. According to (ivτ), [formula] is dense in Gτ. From Lemma [\ref=building:suitable:sets], we conclude that [formula] is a suitable set for Gτ such that [formula] is compact.

Now observe that [formula], and hence φτ:G  →  Gτ is an algebraic isomorphism. Furthermore, φτ is a perfect map by Claim [\ref=phi:are:perfect]. Finally, note that a one-to-one continuous perfect map is a homeomorphism. Thus, G and Gτ are isomorphic as topological groups.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=Hofmann-Morris:theorem]: Let H be a locally compact group. Take an open neighbourhood U of the identity 1H that has a compact closure [formula] in H. Then [formula] is an open (and thus closed [\cite=HR]) subgroup of H. In particular, [formula], and so G is generated by its open subset U with compact closure (in G). According to Theorem [\ref=main:theorem], G has a suitable set S. Choose [formula] such that {xG:x∈X} forms a (faithfully indexed) partition of [formula]. One can easily check now that [formula] is a suitable set for H.
