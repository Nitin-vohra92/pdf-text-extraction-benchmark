The dihedral group D5 as group of symplectic automorphisms on K3 surfaces

Introduction

A finite group of symplectic automorphisms on a K3 surface X has the property that the desingularization of the quotient of X by this group is again a K3 surface. In [\cite=Nikulin_symplectic] the finite abelian groups of symplectic automorphisms on a K3 surface are classified. The main result of Nikulin in [\cite=Nikulin_symplectic] is that the isometries induced by finite abelian groups of symplectic automorphisms on the second cohomology group of a K3 surface are essentially unique. The uniqueness of the isometries induced by G on [formula] implies that the lattice [formula] does not depend on X. Thanks to this result it is possible to associate the lattice ΩG to each finite abelian group G of symplectic automorphisms on a K3 surface. From this one obtains information on the coarse moduli space of K3 surfaces admitting G as group of symplectic automorphisms (cf. [\cite=Nikulin_symplectic], [\cite=symplectic_prime], [\cite=symplectic_not_prime]). In [\cite=symplectic_prime] and [\cite=symplectic_not_prime] the lattices ΩG are computed for each finite abelian group G of symplectic automorphisms on a K3 surface. In [\cite=mukai] and [\cite=Xiao] the finite (not necessary abelian) groups of symplectic automorphisms on a K3 surface are classified. Under some conditions (cf. Section [\ref=section:_symplectic_automorphisms_on_K3_surfaces]) Nikulin's result, on the uniqueness of the isometries induced by finite groups of symplectic automorphisms on the second cohomology group of the K3 surfaces, can be extended to finite (not necessary abelian) groups (cf. [\cite=whitcher]). As a consequence one can attach the lattice [formula], which depends only on G, also to some finite non abelian groups G of symplectic automorphisms on a K3 surface X.

Let us consider a pair of finite groups (G,H) such that G acts symplectically on a K3 surface and H is a subgroup of G. It is evident that the K3 surfaces admitting G as group of symplectic automorphisms, admits also H as group of symplectic automorphisms. It is more surprising that for certain pairs of groups (G,H) also the viceversa holds indeed for certain pair (G,H) the condition "a K3 surface X admits G as group of symplectic automorphism" is equivalent to the condition "X admits H as group of symplectic automorphisms". For these pairs the lattices ΩG and ΩH coincide. The aim of this paper is to describe this situation and to give explicitely one pair (G,H). We observe that in order to find (G,H) with the described property, one has to consider non abelian groups acting symplectically on K3 surfaces, indeed the lattices ΩK associated to abelian groups K are completely described in [\cite=symplectic_prime], [\cite=symplectic_not_prime] and one can check that ΩG and ΩH never coincide if both G and H are abelian and G  ≠  H.

In the Section [\ref=section:_symplectic_automorphisms_on_K3_surfaces] we describe some known results on symplectic automorphisms over kählerian K3 surfaces and we prove our main results (Proposition [\ref=prop:_G_as_symp_group_iff_H_as_symp_group] and Corollary [\ref=cor:_Z/5_iff_Dh5]). In the Proposition [\ref=prop:_G_as_symp_group_iff_H_as_symp_group] we give sufficient conditions on G and H to prove that a K3 surface admits G as group of symplectic automorphisms if and only if it admits H as group of symplectic automorphisms. Applying this proposition we prove (Corollary [\ref=cor:_Z/5_iff_Dh5]) that a K3 surface admits [formula] as group of symplectic automorphisms if and only if it admits D5 (the dihedral group of order 10) as group of symplectic automorphisms. In particular we prove that [formula] In [\cite=symplectic_prime] the isometry induced on [formula] by a symplectic automorphim of order 5, is described. Since we prove that [formula], there is also an involution acting on this lattice. In order to describe both the isometry of order 5 and the involution generating D5 on ΩD5, in the Section [\ref=section:_construction_of_omega5] we give a different description of this lattice: it is an overlattice of [formula] (the isometry of order 5 is induced by the natural one on A4). In the proof of the Corollary [\ref=cor:_omegadh5_is_isomteric_to_DIH10(16)] also the action of the involution is described. Moreover we show that the lattice [formula] (computed in [\cite=symplectic_prime]) is isometric to a lattice describe by Griess and Lam in [\cite=EE8-_lattices_and_dihedral]. In the Section [\ref=section:_examples] we consider algebraic K3 surfaces and in particular 3-dimensional families of K3 surfaces admitting a symplectic automorphisms of order 5, σ5, and a polarization, invariant under σ5. It follows from the results of the Section [\ref=section:_symplectic_automorphisms_on_K3_surfaces] that the K3 surfaces in these families admit also an involution ι, generating together with σ5 the dihedral group D5. For each of these families we exhibit the automorphism σ5 and we find the automorphism ι.

Symplectic automorphisms on K3 surfaces.

Let X be a smooth compact complex surface. The surface X is a K3 surface if the canonical bundle of X is trivial and the irregularity of X, q(X): = h1,0(X), is 0.

The second cohomology group of a K3 surface, equipped with the cup product, is isometric to a lattice, which is the unique, up to isometries, even unimodular lattice with signature (3,19). This lattice will be denoted by ΛK3 and is isometric to [formula], where U is the unimodular lattice with bilinear form [formula] and E8( - 1) is the lattice obtained multipying by - 1 the lattice associated to the Dynking diagram E8. The Néron Severi group of a K3 surface X, NS(X), coincide with its Picard group. The transcendental lattice of X, TX, is the orthogonal to NS(X) in [formula].

An isometry α of [formula] is an effective isometry if it preserves the Kähler cone of X. An isometry α of [formula] is an Hodge isometry if its [formula]-linear extension to [formula] preserves the Hodge decomposition of [formula].

Let X be a K3 surface and g be an automorphism of X, then g* is an effective Hodge isometry of [formula]. Viceversa, let f be an effective Hodge isometry of [formula], then f is induced by an automorphism of X.

An automorphism σ on a K3 surface X is symplectic if σ* acts as the identity on H2,0(X), that is σ*(ωX) = ωX, where ωX is a nowhere vanishing holomorphic two form on X. Equivalently σ is symplectic if the isometry induced by σ* on the transcendental lattice is the identity.

In [\cite=Nikulin_symplectic] the finite abelian groups acting symplectically on a kählerian K3 surface are analyzed. Now it is known that every K3 surface is a Kähler variety, [\cite=Siu], so there are no restrictions on the K3 surfaces analyzed in [\cite=Nikulin_symplectic]. From now on we always assume that G is a finite group of symplectic automorphisms on the K3 surface X.

Let the K3 surface Y be the minimal desingularization of the quotient X / G. Let Mj be the curves arising form the desingularization of the singularities of X / G.

The singularities of the quotient X / G are computed by Nikulin ([\cite=Nikulin_symplectic]) if G is an abelian group, and by Xiao ([\cite=Xiao]) for all the other finite groups. If either G = Q8 (binary dihedral group of order 8) or G = T24 (binary tetrahedral group of order 24), then there are two possible configurations for the singularities of X / G, and hence for the exceptional curve Mj on Y. For all the other groups the number and the type of the singularities of X / G are determined by G.

Let us assume that G  ≠  Q8, G  ≠  T24. The minimal primitive sublattice of NS(Y) containing the curves Mj does not depend on X (cf. [\cite=Nikulin_symplectic], [\cite=Xiao]). It will be denoted by MG.

The lattice MG is computed by Nikulin ([\cite=Nikulin_symplectic]) for each abelian group G, and by Xiao ([\cite=Xiao]) for the all the other gorups G.

For [formula], the lattice [formula] (called Nikulin lattice) is an even overlattice of index 2 of [formula]. Its discriminant group is [formula] (cf. [\cite=Nikulin_symplectic]) and its discriminant form is the same as [formula] (cf. [\cite=morrison]).

We say that G has a unique action on ΛK3 if, given two embeddings [formula], [formula] such that G is a group of symplectic automorphisms on the K3 surfaces X and X', there exists an isometry [formula] such that [formula] for all g∈G.

Let G be a finite group acting symplectically on a K3 surface, G  ≠  Q8, G  ≠  T24. If MG admits a unique primitive embedding in ΛK3, then G has a unique action on ΛK3.

Under the assumptions of the Theorem [\ref=theorem:_unique_action] the lattice [formula] is uniquely determined by G, up to isometry. It will be called ΩG.

By [\cite=Nikulin_symplectic], it follows that rank(ΩG) = rank(MG).

Let G be a finite group acting symplectically on a K3 surface, such that G has a unique action on ΛK3. A K3 surface X admits G as group of symplectic automorphisms if and only if the lattice ΩG is primitively embedded in NS(X).

Nikulin proved that for each abelian group acting symplectically on a K3 surface, the hypothesis of the Theorem [\ref=theorem:_unique_action] (and hence the ones of the Theorem [\ref=theorem:_X_admits_G_iff_omegaG_in_NS(X)]) are satisfied.

Let G be a finite group acting symplectically on a K3 surface and let H be a subgroup of G. Let us assume that both G and H are neither Q8 or T24. We assume that both MH and MG admit a unique primitive embedding in ΛK3 and rank(MG) = rank(MH). Then ΩH≃ΩG and so a K3 surface X admits G as group of symplectic automorphisms if and only if X admits H as group of symplectic automorphisms.

Since H is a subgroup of G, ΩH is a sublattice of ΩG. Moreover rank(ΩG) = rank(ΩH), by the Remark [\ref=rem:_rank_omega_rank_m] and the condition on the rank of the lattices MG and MH. This implies that [formula] with a finite index. Let X be a K3 admitting G as group of symplectic automorphisms. Then both ΩG and [formula] are primitively embedded in NS(X), hence the index of the inclusion [formula] is 1, i.e. ΩG≃ΩH. The K3 surface X admits G as group of symplectic automorphisms if and only if ΩG is primitively embedded in NS(X). By the isometry ΩH≃ΩG this condition is equivalent to require that ΩH is primitively embedded in NS(X), which holds if and only if X admits H as group of symplectic automorphisms.

A K3 surface admits [formula] as group of symplectic automorphisms if and only if it admits D5 as group of symplectic automorphisms.

The lattice [formula] is computed in [\cite=Nikulin_symplectic], where it is proved that it admits a unique primitive embedding in ΛK3 and that its rank is 16. The lattice MD5 is described in [\cite=Xiao] as an overlattice of index 2 of the lattice [formula]. In particular rank(MD5) = 16 and [formula], where [formula] is the Nikulin lattice (see Remark [\ref=rem:_Nikulin_lattice]). Thus the discriminant group of MD5 is [formula]. By [\cite=Nikulin_bilinear], MD5 admits a unique primitive embedding in ΛK3. The corollary immediately follows from the Proposition [\ref=prop:_G_as_symp_group_iff_H_as_symp_group].

Construction of [formula]

The aim of this section is to construct the lattice [formula] as overlattice of [formula] and to describe the action of D5 on this lattice. The automorphism of order five on [formula] will be induced by the automorphism of order five on each copy of A4( - 2).

We will add some rational linear combinations of the elements of [formula] to obtain an even overlattice of [formula]. The main point is that we would like to extend the automorphism of [formula] to the lattice [formula], so if we add an element to [formula] we have to add all elements in its orbit.

We recall that the standard basis of A4 is expressed in terms of the standard basis {εi} of [formula] in the following way: αi  =  εi  -  εi + 1, hence α5 =  - α1  -  α2  -  α3  -  α4. The cyclic permutation of the basis vectors of [formula] induces the automorphism γ on A4 (γ(αi) = αi + 1).

Let us consider the lattice [formula] and the automorphism g: = (γ,γ,γ,γ) (acting as γ on each copy of A4( - 2)). Let aj,i, j,i = 1,2,3,4 be the element αi in the j-copy of A4( - 2). Let Then:

The lattice

[formula]

generated by [formula] and the 8 vectors gi(μ), gi(ν), for i = 0,1,2,3, is an even overlattice of [formula] of rank 16.

The index of [formula] in L is 28.

There are no vectors of length - 2 in L.

Since μ has an integer intersection with the basis {ai,j} of [formula] and has self intersection - 4, we can add the element μ to the lattice [formula] obtaining an even overlattice. All the elements gi(μ) in the orbit of μ have an integer intersection with this basis of [formula] and [formula] for all i,j = 0,1,2,3. Thus we can add the four vectors μ, g(μ), g2(μ), g3(μ) to the lattice [formula]. It is easy to show that the vectors gi(ν), i = 0,1,2,3 have an integer intersection pairing with all the vectors in [formula], and that [formula], [formula] (indeed these are properties of all the vectors of type [formula], k < h < l < m and ν = v1,3,1,2,3,5). Moreover [formula], i,j∈{0,1,2,3} (indeed this is a property of the vectors of type vi,j,k,h,l,m such that [formula] and {k,h,l,m}  =  {i,i + 1,j,j + 2}). Thus adding the vectors in the orbit of ν and of μ to [formula] we construct an even overlattice L of [formula]. By the computation of the discriminant of this lattice, it follows that [formula] has index 28 in L (indeed to construct L we add to [formula] exactly eight vectors of type [formula], [formula] and they are independent over [formula]). Now we prove that there are no vectors with length - 2 in L. Let [formula], [formula]. In [formula] we have:

[formula]

If we require that at least two components of y are equal to zero, we obtain that bi = ci = 0 for all i. So if y  ≠  0, then y has at most one component equal to zero. Each vector w in L is of the form y + z with y as above, bi,ci∈{0,1}, and [formula], moreover such y and z are uniquely determined by w. If y = (0,0,0,0), [formula] and hence w2  ≤   - 4. If y  ≠  (0,0,0,0), then [formula] with wi∈A4( - 2) and at most one of wi = 0. Since w2i  ≤   - 4 and wi  ·  wj = 0 if i  ≠  j, we get [formula]. Hence there are no vectors of length - 2 in L.

The lattice L is isometric to the lattice [formula].

By uniqueness of [formula], to prove the proposition it suffices to show that there exists a K3 surface S such that [formula] is a group of symplectic automorphisms on S and [formula]. By construction L admits an automorphism of order 5, g, acting trivially on the discriminant group. Moreover L is negative definite and its discriminant group is [formula]. Hence it admits a primitive embedding in ΛK3 ([\cite=Nikulin_bilinear]). Since g acts trivially on the discriminat group, G: = 〈g〉 extends to a group of isometries on ΛK3 which acts as the identity on [formula]. Let S be a K3 surface such that L  ⊂  NS(S) (such a K3 surface exists by the surjectivity of the period map). By the Proposition [\ref=prop:_definition_of_L_and_not_-2_vectors], L does not contain elements of length - 2. This is enough to prove that the isometries of G defined above (if necessary composed with a reflection in the Weil group) are effective isometries for S (the proof of this fact is essentially given in [\cite=Nikulin_symplectic], see also [\cite=symplectic_prime]). By construction, these are Hodge isometries (cf. [\cite=Nikulin_symplectic]), so they are induced by automorphisms on S (by the Torelli theorem, cf. [\cite=Burns_Rapoport_torelli_theorem_K3]). Since these automorphisms act as the identity on [formula], they are symplectic. By construction of the isometries of G, [formula], and so [formula].

Since ΩD5≃L, on L acts the dihedral group and in particular an involution. This implies that the lattice [formula] (cf. [\cite=morrison]) is a primitively embedded in L and there exists an involution on L acting as - 1 on this lattice and as the identity on its orthogonal. In the following remark we give an embedding of E8( - 2) in L and in the proof of the Corollary [\ref=cor:_omegadh5_is_isomteric_to_DIH10(16)] we describe the involution associated to this embedding.

Let fi + 8 = g(ei), [formula] where [formula] is the basis of E8( - 2) defined in the Remark [\ref=rem:_E8_in_L]. Since g is an isometry of the lattice it is clear that fi, [formula] generate a copy of E8( - 2) embedded in L. A direct computation shows that the classes ei, fi + 8 [formula] generates a lattice of rank 16 and discriminant 54 embedded in L and so they are a [formula]-basis for L.

The paper [\cite=EE8-_lattices_and_dihedral] classifies positive definite lattices which have dihedral groups Dn (for n = 2,3,4,5,6) in the group of the isometries and which have the properties:

the lattices are rootless (i.e. there are no elements of length 2),

they are the sum of two copies of E8(2),

there are two involutions in Dn acting as minus the identity on each copy of E8(2).

In [\cite=EE8-_lattices_and_dihedral] it is proved that there is a unique lattice with all these properties and admitting D5 in the group of isometries, called DIH10(16).

The lattice DIH10(16) described in [\cite=EE8-_lattices_and_dihedral] is isometric to the lattice L( - 1)≃ΩD5( - 1).

The even lattice L has no vectors of length - 2 (Proposition [\ref=prop:_definition_of_L_and_not_-2_vectors]). On L there is an isometry of order 5, g (Proposition [\ref=prop:_definition_of_L_and_not_-2_vectors]). Let us define a map h on the lattice L which acts as - 1 on the copy of E8( - 2) generated by ei, [formula] (cf. Remark [\ref=rem:_E8_in_L]) and as the idenitity on the orthogonal complement. Since h acts trivially on the discriminant group of [formula], h is an isometry of L and in particular an involution. One can directly check that its action on the basis of [formula] is h(ai,1) =  - ai,1, h(ai,2) =  - ai,5, h(ai,3) =  - ai,4, h(ai,4) =  - ai,3, i = 1,2,3,4. This action extends to a [formula]-basis of L. The group 〈g,h〉 is D5. The involutions h and [formula] are two involutions generating the group D5. By construction h and [formula] act as minus the identity respectively on the lattice [formula] and on the lattice generated by [formula]. These two copies of E8( - 2) generate L (by Remark [\ref=rem:_2_E8_in_L]). So L( - 1) satisfies the conditions which define DIH10(16) and hence DIH10(16)≃L( - 1)≃ΩD5( - 1).

Examples: algebraic K3 surfaces with a polarization of a low degree.

Here we give some very explicit examples of families of K3 surfaces admitting [formula], and hence D5, as group of symplectic automorphisms. In particular in this section we consider algebraic K3 surfaces. We recall that a polarization L, with L2 = 2d, on a K3 surface X defines a map [formula]. In this section we consider K3 surfaces with a polarization L such that φL(X) is a complete intersection in a certain projective space and K3 surfaces with a polarization of degree 2, which exhibits the K3 surfaces as double covers of the plane.

Let X be a general member of a family of K3 surfaces admitting an automorphism of order 5, σ5, and a polarization, L, invariant under σ5. In [\cite=symplectic_prime] the possible Néron-Severi groups of X are computed. In particular if L2 = 2d < 10, one obtains that [formula] . This lattice admits a unique primitive embedding in ΛK3. The family of K3 surfaces with a polarization L, of degree L2  <  10, invariant under a symplectic automorphism of order 5, is then the family of the L2d-polarized K3 surfaces. In particular for each d < 5, we find a 3-dimensional family of K3 with such a polarization L and hence we have the following possibilities:

[formula], so X is a double cover of [formula] branched along a plane sextic curve: in this case NS(X)≃L2;

φL(X) is a quartic in [formula]: in this case NS(X)≃L4;

φL(X) is the complete intersection of a quadric and a cubic in [formula]: in this case NS(X)≃L6;

φL(X) is the complete intersection of three quadrics in [formula]: in this case NS(X)≃L8.

Now we construct a general member of each of these families and show that it also admits a symplectic involution ι generating, together with σ5, the group D5. Since the automorphisms ι and σ5 leave invariant the polarization, both these automorphisms can be extended to automorphisms of the ambient projective space. We will denote by ω a primitive 5-th root of unity.

L2 = 4

This polarization gives a map to [formula] where the K3 surfaces are realized as quartic surfaces. Let us consider the automorphism

[formula]

The quartic surfaces in [formula] defined as

[formula]

are invariant for [formula]. Hence the restriction of [formula] to K3 surfaces with equations [\eqref=formula:_equation_5_in_P3] is an automorphism σ5 of the surfaces. To show that this automorphism is symplectic it suffices to apply σ5 to the following holomorphic two form in local coordinates x = x1 / x0, y = x2 / x0, z = x3 / x0:

[formula]

where f denotes the equation of the quartic in the local coordinate x,y,z. The equation [\eqref=formula:_equation_5_in_P3] depends on 7 parameters. The automorphisms of [formula] commuting with [formula] are diag(α,β,γ,δ) (which is a four dimensional group), hence this family of [formula]-invariant quartics has

[formula]

moduli. So the family of K3 surfaces given by the equation [\eqref=formula:_equation_5_in_P3] is the family of K3 surfaces admitting an automorphisms of order 5 leaving invariant a polarization of degree 4. Up to a projectivity, commuting with [formula], the equation [\eqref=formula:_equation_5_in_P3] becomes

[formula]

Let us define an involution of [formula]:

[formula]

The equation [\eqref=formula:_second_equation_5_in_P3] is invariant under [formula], hence [formula] induces an automorphism of the quartic surfaces with equation [\eqref=formula:_second_equation_5_in_P3], we call this automorphism ι. The fixed point set of [formula] in [formula] is the union of the lines:

[formula]

Hence ι fixes eight points on the quartics [\eqref=formula:_second_equation_5_in_P3]: the intersection of the quartics with l1 and l2. This is enough to show that ι is a symplectic involution, indeed the involutions which are not symplectic either are fixed point free or fix some curves [\cite=Zhang]. Hence the quartics given in [\eqref=formula:_second_equation_5_in_P3] (and hence, up to a projectivity, in [\eqref=formula:_equation_5_in_P3]) admit both the automorphisms σ5 and ι. It is easy to check that [formula], and hence 〈σ5,ι〉  =  D5. So the family of smooth quartic surfaces in [formula] admitting the symplectic automorphism σ5 admits also a symplectic involution ι and in fact the group D5  =  〈σ5,ι〉.

L2 = 6

This polarization gives a map to [formula] where the K3 surfaces are realized as complete intersections of a cubic and a quadric. Let us consider the automorphism

[formula]

Let:

[formula]

then Q and C are [formula]-invariant hypersurfaces in [formula]. We observe that the complete intersection of these two hypersurfaces is generically smooth and thus it is a K3 surface. The complete intersection of Q and C is also the complete intersection of Q and C + λx0Q. Hence there is a 1-dimensional family of invariant cubics giving the same complete intersection: the cubics giving different complete intersections depend on 7 - 1 = 6 parameters. The automorphisms of [formula] which commute with [formula] are of the form diag(α,β,γ,δ,ε). So the family of complete intersections of a cubic and a quadric invariant under the automorphism [formula] has (3 - 1) + (6 - 1) - (5 - 1) = 3 moduli. Let X be the complete intersection of Q and C. The automorphism [formula] induces a symplectic automorphism on X (this can be shown as in case L2 = 4 considering the two holomorphic form, in local coordinates x,y,z,t, [formula] where Fx is the partial derivative of F w.r.t. x). Up to the action of the projectivities commuting with [formula], we can assume that g = h and l = m in the equation of C, in [\eqref=formula:_equation_5_in_P4_quadric]. Hence the involution

[formula]

fixes Q and C. So its restriction to X is an involution, ι, of X. Moreover ι has eight fixed points (six on the plane x1 = x4,x2 = x3 and two on the line x0 = 0, x1 + x4 = 0, x2 + x3 = 0). Thus σ5 and ι are symplectic automorphisms of the K3 surface X and they generate the group D5.

L2 = 8

This polarization gives a map to [formula] where the K3 surfaces are realized as complete intersections three quadrics. Let us consider the map

[formula]

and the complete intersection of the quadrics

[formula]

The group of automorphisms of [formula] commuting with [formula] is (GL(2)  ×  GL(1)4) / GL(1) which has dimension 7 = 8 - 1. So these complete intersections in [formula] have (5 - 1) + (4 - 1) + (4 - 1) - (8 - 1) = 3 moduli. Up to automorphisms of [formula] commuting with [formula] we can assume that the quadrics have the following equation:

[formula]

and in fact they depend on 3 parameters. The complete intersection X of the quadrics Q1, Q2, Q3 is smooth for a generic choice of the parameters b,d,e (one can check it directly putting e = b = 0, d = 1). Moreover X is invariant under the automorphism [formula], so [formula] induces an automorphism σ5 on X and σ5 is symplectic (this can be shown as in the case L2 = 6). The involution

[formula]

fixes the quadric Q1 and switches the quadrics Q2 and Q3. So its restriction to the K3 surface X is an involution, ι, of the surface X. Moreover ι has eight fixed points, on the space x2 = x5, x3 = x4. Thus σ5 and ι are symplectic automorphisms of the K3 surface X and they generate the group D5.

L2 = 2

This polarization gives a 2:1 map to [formula] and the K3 surfaces are realized as double cover of [formula] branched along a sextic plane curve. The map

[formula]

is an automorphism of [formula]. Up to projectivity of [formula] commuting with [formula], the invariant sextic for [formula] are

[formula]

Let X be the double cover of [formula] branched along C6, i.e. X is V(u2 - (x60 + x0x51 + x0x52 + ax40x21x22 + bx30x31x32 + cx31x32)) in the weighted projective space [formula]. The automorphism [formula] lifts to a symplectic automorphism σ5:(u:x0:x1:x2)  →  (u:x0:ωx1:ω4x2) of X. So we constructed the 3-dimensional family of K3 surfaces which are double covers of [formula] and have a symplectic automorphism of order 5 which leavs invarinat the polarization. The involution

[formula]

leaves the curve C6 invariant, so it lifts to an involution αX:(u:x0:x1:x2)  →  (u:x0:x2:x1) of the surface X. The involution αX fixes a curve (the pull back of the line x1 = x2 in [formula]), so it is not symplectic. Let i:(u:x0:x1:x2)  →  ( - u:x0:x1:x2) be the covering involution on X. It is a non symplectic involution (indeed the quotient X / ι is rational) and it commutes both with αX and σ5. The involution [formula] is a symplectic involution on X (because it is the composition of two commuting non symplectic involutions). Moreover one has [formula], and hence D5  =  〈σ5,ι〉 acts symplectically on X.
