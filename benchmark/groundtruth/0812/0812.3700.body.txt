Conjecture Corollary Question

Finite planar emulators for K4,5  -  4K2 and K1,2,2,2 and Fellows' Conjecture

Introduction

We begin by defining the main concepts used in this paper. All graphs considered are assumed to be finite and simple. A map between graphs is assumed to map vertices to vertices and edges to edges. Let [formula] and G be graphs. We say that [formula] is a cover (resp. emulator) of G if there exists a map [formula] so that f is surjective and for any vertex ṽ of [formula], the map induced by f from the neighbors of ṽ to the neighbors of f(ṽ) is a bijection (resp. surjection). A cover (resp. emulator) is called regular if there is a subgroup [formula] (the automorphism group of [formula]) so that [formula], and f is equivalent to the natural projection. In this paper, regular covers and emulators are only used when citing results of Negami and Kitakubo; for detailed definitions see [\cite=negami] (for covers) and [\cite=kitakubo] (for emulators). We note that Kitakubo used the term branched covers for emulators.

Let [formula] be the projection from the sphere to the projective plane given by identifying antipodal points. If a graph G embeds in [formula], then i- 1(G) is a planar double cover of G. Conversely, in [\cite=negami] Negami proved that if a connected graph G admits a finite planar regular cover, then G embeds in [formula]. Negami conjectured that this holds in general:

A connected graph has a finite planar cover if and only if it embeds in the projective plane.

Kitakubo generalized Negami's theorem, showing that if a graph has a finite planar regular emulator, then it embeds in the projective plane. (The authors gave a further generalization in [\cite=yr].) The following conjecture appears in [\cite=negami-survey], where Negami attributes it to Kitakubo:

A connected graph has a finite planar emulator if and only if it embeds in the projective plane.

Prior to Kitakubo, planar emulators were studied by Fellows [\cite=fellowsphd][\cite=fellows], who posed the conjecture below; see, for example, [\cite=hlineny] or [\cite=negami-survey]:

A connected graph has a finite planar emulator if and only if it has a finite planar cover.

In [\cite=hlineny] Hlinný constructed a graph that admits an emulator that embeds in the genus 3 surface, but does not admit a cover that embeds there.

In this note we prove:

The graphs K4,5  -  4K2 and K1,2,2,2 admit finite planar emulators.

Archdeacon [\cite=archdeacon2] proved that K4,5 - 4K2 does not admit a finite planar cover. Together with Theorem [\ref=thm], we get:

The graph K4,5  -  4K2 gives a counterexample to Conjectures [\ref=conj:kitakubo] and [\ref=conj:fellows].

It is known that K1,2,2,2 does not embed in [formula] [\cite=103]. Hence, if it admits a finite planar cover, Negami's Planar Cover Conjecture is false. The work of Archdeacon, Fellows, Hlinný, and Negami shows that the converse also holds, and Negami's Planar Cover Conjecture is in fact equivalent to K1,2,2,2 having no finite planar cover; see, for example, [\cite=negami-survey] or [\cite=hlineny2] and references therein. At the time of writing, the existence of a finite planar cover to K1,2,2,2 remains an intriguing open question. However, Theorem [\ref=thm] shows that K1,2,2,2 does admit a finite planar emulator. Perhaps this should not be seen as evidence against Negami's Planar Cover Conjecture. Perhaps this should be seen as evidence that finite planar emulators are ubiquitous (although clearly not all graphs have finite planar emulators). We note that if Negami's Planar Cover Conjecture holds, then the existence of a finite planar cover can be decided in linear time [\cite=mohar]; the set of forbidden minors is given by Archdeacon [\cite=archdeacon-projective]. By Robertson and Seymour [\cite=rs] there is a set of forbidden minors for existence of a finite planar emulator; therefore [\cite=rs2] existence of such an emulator can be decided in polynomial time.

What graphs admit finite planar emulators? What is the set of forbidden minors? Construct an algorithm to decide if a given graph admits a finite planar emulator. What is the complexity of this problem?

In Section [\ref=sec:ArchdeaconsGraph] we explicitly show an emulator with 50 vertices for K4,5  -  4K2 and in Section [\ref=sec:1222] we explicitly show an emulator with 266 vertices for K1,2,2,2, thus proving Theorem [\ref=thm]. The emulator for K1,2,2,2 is symmetric and quotients out to an emulator with 133 vertices that embeds in [formula].

A Finite Planar Emulator for K4,5  -  4K2.

An emulator for K4,5  -  4K2 is given in Figure [\ref=fig:ArchdeaconsGraph]. We explain how to read this graph. K4,5  -  4K2 is constructed as follows: start with the 1-skeleton of a cube (Figure [\ref=fig:cube]) and add a ninth vertex, denoted v, that is connected to the vertices of the cube labeled 1, 3, 5, and 7. The graph shown in Figure [\ref=fig:ArchdeaconsGraph] maps to K4,5  -  4K2; each vertex is shown as a small circle labeled by the vertex of K4,5  -  4K2 it gets sent to. It can be checked directly that it is a finite planar emulator of K4,5  -  4K2.

Remarks.

It is easy to see how the graph was put together. It is made of 8 white "triangles", each triangle meeting 3 others (this pattern can be seen by taking the convex hull of the midpoints of the edges of a cube or an octahedron). Each triangle is simply a corner of the cube (3 squares).

Note that the graph presented in Figure [\ref=fig:ArchdeaconsGraph] is not a cover of K4,5  -  4K2. For example, we can find a vertex with label 0 which is adjacent to two vertices labeled 3.

A Finite Planar Emulator for K1,2,2,2.

An emulator for K1,2,2,2 is derived from Figure [\ref=fig:1222]. We explain how to read this graph. K1,2,2,2 is constructed as follows: start with the 1-skeleton of an octahedron (Figure [\ref=fig:cube]) and add a seventh vertex, denoted v, that is connected to all the vertices of the octahedron. The graph shown in Figure [\ref=fig:1222] maps to the 1-skeleton of the octahedron; each vertex is shown as a small circle labeled by the vertex of the octahedron it gets sent to. It can be checked directly that it is a finite planar emulator of the 1-skeleton of the octahedron.

Note that some of the faces have been shaded (this includes the outside face). We add a vertex in each of these faces. These vertices all map to v and are connected to every vertex on the boundary of the shaded cells. On the boundary of each shaded face we see all the labels, so each of the vertices that map to v has all the necessary neighbors. Finally, we see that each vertex in Figure [\ref=fig:1222] is on the boundary of at least one shaded face; hence, every vertex has a neighbor that maps to v.

This completes our construction of a finite planar emulator of K1,2,2,2.

Remark. By viewing S2 as the boundary of the convex hull of the midpoints of the edges of the cube or the octahedron, we may draw the emulator for K1,2,2,2 symmetrically, so that it is invariant under the antipodal involution. The quotient gives an emulator for K1,2,2,2 that has 133 vertices and embeds in [formula]. This symmetric presentation of the emulator of K1,2,2,2 reveals another interesting property. By considering the eight triangular faces (each shown in Figure [\ref=fig:1222] as a white triangle with a single shaded face), we can see that they are formed from the union of 4 great circles, one with the labels 0, 1, 2, one with the labels 2, 3, 4, one with the labels 1, 3, 5, and one with the labels 0, 4, 5. Note that if we two color the faces of the octahedron, we have exactly all the faces of one color.
