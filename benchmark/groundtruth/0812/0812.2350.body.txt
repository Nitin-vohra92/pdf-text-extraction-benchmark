On Invertibility of Sobolev Mappings

Introduction

We study differential inclusions under which a Sobolev mapping [formula] is invertible, at least locally. Here [formula] is a connected open set, [formula]. A differential inclusion means that the differential matrix Df, which exist a.e., must be an element of a certain subset of n  ×  n matrices. Specifically, we consider the sets

[formula]

where [formula]. Note that Mn(δ1)  ⊂  Mn(δ2) if δ1  >  δ2, and Mn( - 1) consists of all n  ×  n matrices. When [formula], the differential inclusion Df∈Mn(δ) admits noninvertible solutions such as orthogonal projections. For this reason we introduce a subset of Mn(δ) which contains matrices with distortion at most K, [formula].

[formula]

Here and in what follows [formula] is the operator norm of matrix A with respect to the Euclidean vector norm, which is denoted by [formula].

Let [formula] be a nonconstant mapping. If there exist δ >  - 1 and K <   ∞   such that the differential matrix Df(x) belongs to Mn(δ,K) for almost every x∈Ω, then f is a local homeomorphism. If in addition [formula], then f is a homeomorphism.

A mapping [formula] such that [formula] a.e. in Ω is called K-quasiregular [\cite=Rebook] [\cite=Ribook]. It is called K-quasiconformal if f is also a homeomorphism. In the planar case n = 2 it is convenient to identify [formula] with [formula] and use the complex derivatives [formula]. Set [formula] for [formula].

Suppose that [formula] is K-quasiregular and nonconstant. If [formula] a.e. for some τ  <  τK, then f is a local homeomorphism. If in addition [formula], then f is a homeomorphism.

Corollary [\ref=QRThm] extends the main results of [\cite=IKO], where it was assumed that [formula] a.e. Its sharpness is demonstrated by the following example.

For every [formula] there exists a nonconstant K-quasiregular mapping [formula] such that [formula] and f is not a local homeomorphism.

Theorem [\ref=ThMain0] is a special case of more general results stated as Theorems [\ref=ThMain] and [\ref=ThMain2] in which the assumption of quasiregularity is relaxed. We say that [formula] is a mapping of finite distortion if [formula] a.e. and the matrix Df vanishes a.e. in the zero set of det Df. With such mappings we associate two distortion function, outer and inner.

[formula]

Here [formula] stands for the cofactor matrix of Df and J(x,f) =  det Df(x). A standard reference for mappings of finite distortion is the monograph by Iwaniec and Martin [\cite=IMbook]. When [formula], i.e., f has bounded distortion, we recover the class of K-quasiregular mappings.

Suppose that [formula] is nonconstant and [formula] where p = 1 if n = 2 and p > n - 1 if [formula]. If there exists δ >  - 1 such that Df(x)∈Mn(δ) for almost every x∈Ω, then f is a local homeomorphism.

Under the assumptions of Theorem [\ref=ThMain], if [formula], then f is a global homeomorphism onto [formula].

One cannot allow p < n - 1 in Theorem [\ref=ThMain], as is demonstrated by Example [\ref=ball]. Remarks [\ref=monotone] and [\ref=notmonotone] in Section [\ref=mainproofs] show that Theorem [\ref=ThMain2] does not hold when Ω is a proper convex domain (even a half-space) unless [formula].

The assumptions on the distortion in Theorems [\ref=ThMain] and [\ref=ThMain2] guarantee that f is a discrete and open mapping, see Theorem [\ref=discreteopen]. If we know a priori that f is discrete and open, then a sufficiently high degree of integrability of Df can substitute for the integrability of KO(  ·  ,f).

Let [formula], where p = 2 if n = 2 and p > (n - 1)2 if [formula]. Suppose further that f is discrete and open and there exists δ >  - 1 such that Df(x)∈Mn(δ) for a.e. x∈Ω. Then f is a local homeomorphism. If in addition [formula], then f is a homeomorphism.

We conclude the introduction by comparing our results with known injectivity theorems. It is easy to see that A∈Mn(δ) for some δ >  - 1 if and only if A does not have negative eigenvalues; that is, [formula]. Injectivity of differentiable mappings under similar spectral conditions has been studied recently, e.g., in [\cite=FGR] [\cite=SX] and references therein. In [\cite=FGR] it is proved that if f is differentiable everywhere and [formula] for some ε > 0 independent of x, then f is injective. Under these assumptions f is already known to be a local homeomorphism. In contrast, we consider weakly differentiable mappings, not excluding the possibility Df = 0. For us, proving that f is a local homeomorphism is the main part of the argument. The invertibility of Sobolev mappings was also studied in [\cite=Ba] in connection with boundary value problems of nonlinear elastostatics.

Quasiregular mappings in dimensions [formula] are known to be locally invertible if the distortion K is sufficiently small [\cite=Go] [\cite=MRV]. A quantitative version of this result was recently proved by Rajala [\cite=Ra2]. It is a long-standing open problem whether KI < 2 suffices [\cite=MRV]. Another way to obtain injectivity is to impose a stronger regularity requirement on f. Heinonen and Kilpeläinen [\cite=HK] proved that any mapping [formula] with [formula] is a local homeomorphism. They raised the interesting question whether a quasiregular mapping f with dilatation tensor [formula], where

[formula]

is a local homeomorphism.

Finally, the injectivity of planar quasiregular mappings under certain boundary conditions was established in [\cite=LN], [\cite=BDIS] and already found applications in the theory of differential inclusions [\cite=FS].

Preliminaries

We collect the basic properties of discrete and open mappings which can be found in [\cite=Ribook].

Let Ω be a domain in [formula] and let [formula] be a continuous mapping. We say that f is discrete if the preimage of every point y∈f(Ω) is a discrete set. If f takes open sets to open sets then f is an open mapping. A domain [formula] is called a normal domain for f if f(∂G) = ∂f(G). For [formula] the local degree of f at y with respect to G is denoted μ(y,f,G). If x∈G and G is a normal domain such that [formula], then G is called a normal neighborhood of x. In this case we write i(x,f) = μ(f(x),f,G) for the topological index of f at x. The branch set Bf consists of all points in Ω at which f is not a local homeomorphism. Outside the branch set either [formula] or [formula]. In the first case f is sense-preserving. For E  ⊂  Ω we write

[formula]

If f is a discrete and open mapping and [formula], then N(f,E) <   ∞  . Also, N(f,G) = i(x,f) if G is a normal neighborhood of x. The open ball with radius r centered at a will be denoted by B(a,r).

On several occasions we will use the following result about limits of local homeomorphisms. Although it is likely to be known, we could not find it explicitly stated in the literature. We give a proof that was communicated to us by Jussi Väisälä [\cite=Va].

Let [formula] be a sequence of (local) homeomorphisms which converges locally uniformly to a discrete and open mapping f. Then f is a (local) homeomorphism.

First we consider the case of local homeomorphisms. For this we fix x0∈Ω and let y0 = f(x0), yj = fj(x0). We will prove that there is a neighborhood of x0 in which fj is injective for all j. Let U(x0,f,r) be the connected component of f- 1(B(y0,r)) containing x0. We choose r sufficiently small so that U = U(x0,f,r) is a normal neighborhood of x0 [\cite=Ribook]. We may assume that [formula] for all [formula] and for every j.

Set U1 = U(x0,f,r / 3). Since [formula], there is a component Qj of f- 1j(B(y0,2r / 3)) containing x0. For x∈∂U we have [formula], therefore [formula] and thus [formula]. By [\cite=MRV], fj maps Qj homeomorphically onto B(y0,2r / 3). As f(U1) = B(y0,r / 3), we have fj(U1)  ⊂  B(y0,2r / 3), which implies U1  ⊂  Qj. Hence the restriction of fj to U1 is injective for all j.

Using the homotopy invariance of the topological degree [\cite=Ribook], we obtain

[formula]

for all j. Therefore, f is a local homeomorphism at x0, [\cite=Ribook].

Now we turn to the case of global homeomorphisms. Suppose to the contrary that there are points x0  ≠  x'0 such that f(x0) = f(x'0) = y0. We choose r sufficiently small so that U = U(x0,f,r) and U' = U(x0',f,r) are disjoint normal neighborhoods of x0 and x' respectively. Let Qj  =  f- 1j(B(y0,2r / 3)); this is a connected set because fj is a homeomorphism. The above argument shows that Qj  ⊂  U and Qj  ⊂  U'. This is a contradiction because U and U' are disjoint.

The following sufficient condition for a local homeomorphism to be injective is due to John [\cite=Jo], see also [\cite=Os].

Suppose that [formula] is a local homeomorphism and there exists ε > 0 such that

[formula]

Then f is a homeomorphism onto [formula].

Distortion estimates

The following extension of the fundamental Reshetnyak's theorem [\cite=Rebook] is due to Iwaniec and Sverák [\cite=IS] in the planar case, and to Manfredi and Villamor [\cite=MV] in higher dimensions.

Suppose that [formula] and [formula] where p = 1 if n = 2 and p > n - 1 if [formula]. Then f is either constant or both discrete and open.

For our applications of Theorem [\ref=discreteopen] we need to estimate the distortion functions of fλ(x): = f(x) + λx, λ > 0. This task is of purely algebraic nature. Namely, for an n  ×  n matrix A with det A > 0 we write

[formula]

where [formula] are the singular values of A arranged in the nonincreasing order. Note that [\eqref=distdef] is consistent with ([\ref=distclassical]), see  [\cite=IMbook]. We write [formula] for the minimum of a and b.

Let A∈Mn(δ), δ >  - 1, be an invertible matrix. For λ > 0 let Aλ = A + λI. Then

[formula]

where [formula]. Furthermore,

[formula]

We may assume δ∈( - 1,0], in which case [formula]. Observe that if two vectors [formula] satisfy [formula], then the reverse triangle inequality holds:

[formula]

Indeed, we have

[formula]

which yields [\eqref=revtri] upon completing the square in two different ways.

Estimate [\eqref=revtri] and the triangle inequality imply

[formula]

for all [formula]. By the Courant-Fischer theorem [\cite=HJbook] the singular values of A can be computed as

[formula]

where the minimum is taken over all subspaces [formula] of dimension n + 1 - j. Using [\eqref=this] and [\eqref=lambda3] to estimate σj(Aλ), we arrive at

[formula]

For [formula] the double inequality [\eqref=lambda4] yields

[formula]

This implies [\eqref=lambda1] by virtue of [\eqref=distdef]. Finally [\eqref=lambda2] follows from the left hand side of ([\ref=lambda3]).

Under the assumptions of Lemma [\ref=lambdadist] we have det Aλ > 0. Indeed, det Aλ  ≠  0 by [\eqref=lambda2]. Since λ- n det Aλ  →  1 as λ  →    ∞  , the continuity of λ  ↦   det Aλ yields det Aλ > 0.

Proofs of Theorems [\ref=ThMain0], [\ref=ThMain], [\ref=ThMain2] and [\ref=ThMain3]

If a smooth invertible mapping f has (Df)- 1∈L∞, then its inverse f- 1 is Lipschitz. We prove a similar estimate without assuming injectivity or smoothness of f.

Suppose [formula] is a discrete and open mapping such that

[formula]

Then for every a∈Ω we have

[formula]

Since f is discrete and open it is either sense-preserving or sense-reversing [\cite=Ribook]. We may assume that f is sense-preserving. Since f- 1 does not exist in general we will work with a substitute mapping gU defined in ([\ref=gUreal]) below. To prove that gU is Lipschitz we will use Theorem 2.1 in [\cite=KO] which requires the following.

Condition (N): f preserves sets of measure zero

Condition (N- 1): f- 1(E) has measure zero whenever E does

The branch set Bf has measure zero

First we observe that the inner distortion of f is locally integrable because

[formula]

By Theorem A [\cite=MM] the mapping f satisfies condition (N). The validity of (N- 1) follows from Theorem 1.2 in [\cite=KM]. By virtue of ([\ref=bound]) J(  ·  ,f) > 0 a.e., which implies (iii) because Df cannot be invertible at branch points [\cite=Ribook].

Let U be a normal neighborhood of a∈Ω. For a sufficiently small r > 0 we choose u∈C∞0(Ω) such that

[formula]

Then we define

[formula]

for y∈f(U). We claim that [formula] is bounded a.e. in f(U).

Fix y∈f(U) and [formula]. By Lemma I.4.7 in [\cite=Ribook] the set [formula] is a finite union of normal domains [formula] where [formula]. It is clear that [formula] for all z∈B(y,ρ).

By Theorem 2.1 in [\cite=KO] gVi∈W1,n(B(y,ρ)) for all [formula] with the estimate

[formula]

Jensen's inequality yields

[formula]

Combining this with ([\ref=blah]) and summing over i we obtain

[formula]

Next we use ([\ref=gU]) to estimate [formula] from above:

[formula]

We estimate KI(  ·  ,f) by ([\ref=blah1]).

[formula]

Applying the change of variable inequality, Lemma I.4.11 in [\cite=Ribook], we obtain

[formula]

Dividing by |B(y,ρ)| and letting [formula] we conclude that [formula] a.e. in f(U), where C = 2MN(f,U)2.

We have established that [formula] for all z,w∈B(f(a),d), where [formula]. It also follows from [\eqref=gU] that gU(f(a)) = 0. Therefore gU(y) < 1 whenever [formula]. By the definition of gU this implies [formula] for all y∈B(f(a),r / C). This completes the proof.

In the proof of the following lemma we use an idea of Kirchheim and Székelyhidi [\cite=KS].

Under the assumptions of Theorem [\ref=ThMain] the mapping fλ(x) = f(x) + λx is a local homeomorphism for all λ > 0.

Lemma [\ref=lambdadist] implies [formula] where p = 1 if n = 2 and p > n - 1 if [formula]. Also, fλ is nonconstant, for otherwise we would have Df =  - λI∉Mn(δ). Therefore, fλ is discrete and open by Theorem [\ref=discreteopen].

Suppose to the contrary that fλ is not a local homeomorphism. Without loss of generality 0∈Bfλ and f(0) = 0. Since f is sense-preserving, [formula]. Define

[formula]

Recall that the topological index is upper semicontinuous; that is,

[formula]

provided gn  →  g locally uniformly, and gn and g are discrete and open.

Since

[formula]

locally uniformly it follows that 0∉Bfλ for sufficiently large λ. Therefore Λ  <    ∞  . By [\eqref=uppersemi] we have 0∈BfΛ. It follows from [\eqref=lambda2] that

[formula]

a.e in Ω. Applying Lemma [\ref=liminf] to fΛ we obtain

[formula]

We will obtain a contradiction by showing that 0∈Bfλ whenever |λ  -  Λ| is sufficiently small. By ([\ref=13]) there exist ε > 0 and r0 > 0 such that [formula] whenever 0 < |x| < r0. Fix λ > 0 such that [formula]. Since [formula], the homotopy invariance of topological degree yields

[formula]

for all 0 < r < r0. Therefore, [formula], which means 0∈BfΛ. This is the desired contradiction.

By Lemma [\ref=lochom] fλ is a local homeomorphism for all λ > 0. Also f is discrete and open by Theorem [\ref=discreteopen]. Applying Proposition [\ref=PrVa] we conclude that f is a local homeomorphism.

As in the proof of Theorem [\ref=ThMain] we have that fλ is a local homeomorphism for all λ > 0. It follows from [\eqref=lambda2] that

[formula]

a.e. in [formula]. Now Lemma [\ref=liminf] yields

[formula]

for all [formula]. By Theorem [\ref=john] fλ is a homeomorphism. Since f is discrete and open by Theorem [\ref=discreteopen] we can apply Proposition [\ref=PrVa] and conclude that f is a homeomorphism.

Theorem [\ref=ThMain0] is an immediate consequence of Theorems [\ref=ThMain] and  [\ref=ThMain2].

We will apply Theorems [\ref=ThMain] or [\ref=ThMain2], as appropriate, to fλ(x) = f(x) + λx for λ > 0. In order to do so we must show that fλ is a mapping of finite distortion with sufficient degree of integrability of KO(  ·  ,f). First, J(  ·  ,fλ) > 0 a.e. by Remark [\ref=positive]. Second, using [\eqref=lambda2] and [\eqref=distdef] we obtain

[formula]

a.e. in Ω. Therefore [formula], where p = 2 if n = 2 and p > n - 1 if [formula]. It remains to apply Theorems [\ref=ThMain] or [\ref=ThMain2] and pass to the limit λ  →  0 using Proposition [\ref=PrVa].

We conclude this section with two remarks concerning integration of differential inclusions.

The case [formula] of Theorem [\ref=ThMain3] only requires p = 1. Indeed, integrating Df along a.e. line segment and using the assumption Df∈Mn(δ) we find that

[formula]

whenever the line segment

[formula]

When - 1  <  δ < 0, the differential inclusion Df∈Mn(δ) cannot be integrated to yield [\eqref=deltamon]. A counterexample is given by the complex function f(z) = z5 / 2 defined in the right half-plane [formula]. Indeed, for 2π / 5  <  θ  <  π / 2 the vectors f(eiθ) - f(e- iθ) and eiθ  -  e- iθ point in exactly opposite directions. This mapping also fails to be injective, which shows that the global injectivity part of Theorems [\ref=ThMain0], [\ref=ThMain2] and [\ref=ThMain3] is not true for general convex domains.

Planar case: proof of Corollary [\ref=QRThm]

In the planar case n = 2 the quasiregularity assumption can be expressed in terms of the complex derivatives fz and [formula] as follows. A mapping [formula] is K-quasiregular if and only if [formula] a.e. in Ω, where K = (1 + k) / (1 - k). We also need to translate the condition Df∈M2(δ) into the complex language.

Let [formula] be a mapping, and fix δ∈( - 1,1). At each point of differentiability of f the following three conditions are equivalent:

Df∈M2(δ)

[formula]

either

[formula]

[formula]

Fix a point z∈Ω where f is differentiable and let α = fz(z), [formula]. Condition [\eqref=dcomi] is readily seen to be equivalent to

[formula]

In geometric terms [\eqref=dcom3] means that the disk with center α and radius [formula] is contained in the closed sector [formula]. The latter condition is equivalent to [\eqref=dcom0] because the half-lines [formula] are tangent to the disk.

Next we prove that [\eqref=dcom0] implies [\eqref=dcomiii]. Suppose that [\eqref=dcom0] holds. An immediate consequence is [formula], i.e. the first part of [\eqref=dcom2]. If also the second inequality in [\eqref=dcom2] holds, then we have [\eqref=dcomiii]. Thus we may assume that the second inequality in [\eqref=dcom2] fails, which means [formula]. We can rewrite [\eqref=dcom0] as

[formula]

where the right-hand side is less than [formula]. Therefore, we can apply the sine function to both sides of [\eqref=dcom4] and obtain

[formula]

which after multiplication by [formula] becomes

[formula]

This completes the proof of [\eqref=dcomiii].

Finally, we will suppose [\eqref=dcomiii] and prove [\eqref=dcom0]. If [\eqref=dcom1] holds, then

[formula]

which implies [\eqref=dcom0]. If [\eqref=dcom2] holds, then

[formula]

and [\eqref=dcom0] follows again.

In the special case [formula] one can simplify Lemma [\ref=dcom] by removing [\eqref=dcom2]. This fact can be inferred from Theorem 3.11.6 in [\cite=AIMbook] or, in a less precise form, from Lemma 10 in [\cite=K].

Recall that

[formula]

We may assume that 0 < τ  <  τK. Set [formula]. Since [formula], it follows that

[formula]

Therefore, [formula], which implies δ >  - 1. For a.e. z∈Ω we have

[formula]

Now Lemma [\ref=dcom] yields Df∈M2(δ) a.e. in Ω. By Theorem [\ref=ThMain] f is a local homeomorphism. If [formula], then f is a homeomorphism by Theorem [\ref=ThMain2].

Failure of invertibility

First we show the sharpness of Corollary [\ref=QRThm] by constructing a mapping as in Example [\ref=branchex]. That is, we exhibit a nonconstant mapping [formula] such that

[formula]

and f has a branch point at 0. Here [formula], see [\eqref=tau]. The construction is split into two cases depending on the value of k.

Case 1. [formula]. In this case we will construct a K-quasiregular mapping f with branch point at 0 such that

[formula]

Let [formula], b =  - ik. First we define a quasiregular mapping from the first quadrant [formula] onto the upper half plane by the formula

[formula]

Its complex derivatives are

[formula]

Note that [formula]. Also the image of Q1 under the mapping fz is the rotated quadrant [formula]. Since arg a∈[0,π  /  4], for all w∈R1 we have

[formula]

Therefore, [\eqref=exam1] holds in the interior of Q1.

By reflection about the real axis we extend f to the fourth quadrant [formula]; that is, we set [formula] if z∈Q4. For z in the interior of Q4 we have [formula] and therefore [\eqref=exam1] holds again.

Finally we extend f to the left halfplane as an even function; that is, f(z) = f( - z). It is easy to see that f is quasiregular in [formula] and [\eqref=exam1] is satisfied everywhere in [formula] except for the coordinate axes.

Case 2. [formula]. Following Example 5.1 in [\cite=IKO] we introduce the parameters ε,δ∈(0,1) so that

[formula]

For [formula] we define f(z) by the formula

[formula]

and then extend it to the lower halfplane by reflection [formula]. In [\cite=IKO] it is proved that

[formula]

It remains to show that [\eqref=exam2] holds. If [formula] there is nothing to prove. Otherwise we have [formula] which implies

[formula]

This proves [\eqref=exam2].

Let Ω be the unit ball [formula], [formula]. For any δ∈( - 1,0) there exists a Lipschitz mapping [formula] such that KO(  ·  ,f)∈Lq(Ω) for all q < n - 1 and Df∈Mn(δ) a.e. but f is not a local homeomorphism.

Fix δ∈( - 1,0) and set ε  =    -  δ. Following [\cite=Ba], define [formula] by the rule

[formula]

where [formula]. The construction of Example 1 in [\cite=Ba] shows that f is Lipschitz and J(x,f) > 0 for almost every x∈Ω. So f is a mapping of finite distortion and a direct computation shows that

[formula]

On the other hand, f(x) = 0 whenever s(x)  =  0, which implies that f is not a local homeomorphism.

It remains to show that Df∈Mn(δ) a.e. in Ω. Fix x∈Ω such that s(x)  ≠  0 and denote A = Df(x). The entries of A are as follows: for [formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

Let [formula] be a unit vector. We must prove that

[formula]

Here

[formula]

If [formula], then [formula] and we are done. Suppose tξn  <  0. Since [formula], it follows that

[formula]

Dividing by |ξn| we obtain

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

Since [formula], inequality ([\ref=19]) follows.

Concluding remarks

Theorems [\ref=ThMain], [\ref=ThMain2] and [\ref=ThMain3] could be strengthened if the well-known Iwaniec-Martin- Sverák conjecture is true.

[\cite=IMbook] If [formula] and [formula] then f is either constant or both discrete and open.

Namely, in Theorems [\ref=ThMain] and [\ref=ThMain2] the requirement on the distortion function could be replaced by [formula]. Indeed, this requirement is only needed to ensure that f and fλ are discrete and open.

In Theorem [\ref=ThMain3] it would suffice to have p = n for all [formula]. Then instead of [\eqref=instead] we would use the estimate

[formula]

which implies [formula]. The requirement [formula] remains essential in view of the examples in [\cite=KKM]. Observe that for this improvement of Theorem [\ref=ThMain3] it would suffice to verify the Iwaniec-Martin- Sverák conjecture above the critical exponent 1; that is, for [formula] with q > 1. It seems likely that this case of the conjecture should be more tractable. Indeed, in terms of the outer distortion the critical exponent is n - 1 and discreteness and openness have been proved above the critical exponent by Manfredi and Villamor [\cite=MV]. In the critical case the conjecture has been verified under the additional assumption that f is quasi-light [\cite=HM] [\cite=Ra].
