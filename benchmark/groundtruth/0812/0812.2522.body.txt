On Group bijections φ with φ(B) = A and [formula]

11B60, 11B34, 20D60.

Introduction

Let A and B be finite subsets of a group G with and |A| = |B|. A Wakeford pairing from B onto A is a bijection φ:B  →  A such that xφ(x)∉A, for every x∈B.

Our pairings are dual to pairings used in litterature [\cite=fl] [\cite=los] [\cite=el]. The two notions are equivalent up to replacing the group its opposite group or by replacing (A,B) by (A- 1,B- 1). With our choice, isoperimetric theorems apply more quicquely. Fan and Losonczy [\cite=fl] introduced this notion in [formula] in connection with an old problem of Wakeford related to canonical forms for symmetric tensors.

The number of distinct matching from B onto A will be denoted by μ(B,A).

Let us define a prime group as a group having no proper finite subgroup H. By elementary Group Theory, a group ia a prime group if and only if it is a torsion free group or if it has a prime order.

The next two results are due Losonczy in the abelian case [\cite=los] and to Eliahou-Lecouvey in the non-abelian case [\cite=el]:

If A and B be finite subsets of a prime group with the same cardinality such that 1∉B, then μ(B,A)  ≠  0.

If B is a finite subset of a group such that 1∉B, then μ(B,B)  ≠  0.

The relation 1∉B is obviously a necessary condition for the existence of such a pairing. Take a proper finite subgroup H, [formula] and a∉H. Put [formula]. Suppose that there exists a Wakeford pairing φ:B  →  H. Clearly φ(a) = 1 and hence φ(h)∈H. Thus φ(h)h∈H, a contradiction.

These observations made by Losonczy in [\cite=los] show that in a non-prime group, there exist finite subsets A and B with the same cardinality such that 1∉B, and μ(B,A) = 0. such a thing can not hold in prime groups, by the result mentioned above.

The results mentioned above are proved using some standard Addition Theorems presented below:

Let A and B be finite subsets of a group G. Kneser's Theorem [\cite=knesrdensite] states that |AB|  ≥  |A| + |B| - 1 if G is abelian and if AB is aperiodic. The Scherck-Kemperman Theorem states that |AB|  ≥  |A| + |B| - 1, if [formula] This result was proved first by Scherck [\cite=scherck] for abelian groups and by Kemperman [\cite=kempcompl] for arbitrary groups. As observed by Eliahou-Lecouvey [\cite=el], the existence of a symmetric pairing is related the Scherck-Kemperman Theorem. In the non-abelian case, a result due to Olson [\cite=olsonjnt] states that |AB|  ≥  |A| + |B| - |H|, where H is a subgroup depending on A and B. This last result is related to one result proved independently and shortly before it by the author in [\cite=hejc2]. Developments of this the last result are known as isoperimetric results:

A main tool in the present work is the isoperimetric approach developed by the author [\cite=hejc2] [\cite=hejc3] [\cite=halgebra] [\cite=hast] [\cite=hkemp]. Let us present briefly this method:

The subgroup generated by a set X will be denoted by 〈X〉. Let S be a finite subset of a group G with 1∈S. The kth-connectivity of S is defined as

[formula]

where [formula].

We shall say that S is a Cauchy subset if κ1(S) = |S| - 1. We shall say that S is a Vosper subset if κ2(S)  ≥  |S|. Clearly S is a Cauchy subset if and only if for every X  ⊂  〈S〉 with |X|  ≥  1,

[formula]

Also, S is a Vosper subset if and only if for every X  ⊂  〈S〉 with |X|  ≥  2,

[formula]

A non-empty subset S of a group will be called a Chowla subset if the order of every element of S is ≥  |S| + 1. The notion of a Chowla subset, introduced by the author in [\cite=halgebra] as a relaxation of Chowla's condition in cyclic groups, allows to extend additive properties of prime groups to a large class of subsets of an arbitrary group.

Pairings existence is related to the Cauchy property and the Vosper's property allows to give a lower bound for the number of distinct pairings. We shall investigate pairing of a Chowla subset B onto an arbitrary A and obtain a lower bound for the number of distinct pairings in this case.

Recall the following notion used by Károlyi in his generalization of Vosper's Theorem [\cite=karolyi]:

For a group G, put

[formula]

where [formula] In particular p(G) =   ∞   if G is a prime group.

The organization of the paper is the following:

Section 2 contains essentially known results. Section 2.1 presents König-Hall's Theorem and its particular formulation in the Wakeford graph. Section 2.2 the Erds-Heilbronn averaging argument used to give a bound for the maximum degree of the Wakeford graph R  =  {(x,y)∈B  ×  A | xy∉A}. Section 2.3 presents some isoperimetric formalism. In Section 3, we prove an inverse theorem for cofinite sets. As an application, we obtain the following result:

If B be a finite Chowla subset of a group G and A is a subset of G with |A| = |B|, then μ(B,A)  ≠  0.

In particular, μ(B,A)  ≠  0, if |B| < p(G), where B is a finite subset of a group [formula] and A is a subset of G with |A| = |B|.

Applied to groups with a prime order, the last result reduces to a result of Losonczy [\cite=los]. Also in the case of torsion free groups, it reduces to a result of Eliahou-Lecouvey [\cite=el] generalizing results of Wakeford [\cite=wak] and Losonczy [\cite=los] in the abelian case [\cite=wak].

Assuming that B is a finite Chowla subset of a group G and that A be a subset of G with |A| = |B|, we show in Section 4 that one of the following holds:

[formula]

For some a∈A, [formula]

For some a∈A, Aa- 1 is a progression,

where q denotes the cardinality of the subgroup generated by B. In particular either [formula] or for some a∈B, Ba- 1 is a progression.

Let us now construct two basic examples having a unique Wakeford pairing, where exactly one of the conditions (ii) and (iii) is satisfied:

Put [formula] There is clearly a unique matching from rP onto P, where φ:rs  ↦  rj + 1 - s. Thus μ(rP,P) = 1.

Put [formula] and take [formula] Set [formula] There is a unique matching φ:Q  →  P with φ(a) = 1. Thus μ(Q,P) = 1.

The last example shows that one may have μ(A,B) = 1 for a set A which is not a right progression.

Preliminaries

Matchings

Let R  ⊂  V  ×  W be a relation. A selection of R is a mapping S:V  →  W such that (x,S(x))∈R, for every x∈V. We shall write

Δ(R) =  max {|R(x)|:x∈V} and Δ- 1(R) =  max {|R- 1(x)|:x∈W}.

Suppose that |V| = |W|. A bijective selection of R is called a matching of R. The number of matchings of R will be denoted by μ(R).

We shall use the next two known results:

(König-Hall's Theorem) [\cite=lovasz] Let R  ⊂  V  ×  W be a relation with |V| = |W|. Then R has a matching if and only if |R(Y)|  ≥  |Y|, for every subset Y of V.

An easy consequence of König-Hall's Theorem is the following result observed by Hetyei, c.f. [\cite=lovasz]:

Let R  ⊂  V  ×  W be a relation with |V| = |W| such that |R(Y)|  ≥  |Y| + 1, for every proper subset Y of V. Then every arc (x,y)∈R lies in some matching of R. In particular, μ(R)  ≥   max {Δ(R),Δ- 1(R)}.

Some applications of Matching Theory may be found in the book of Lovász and Plummer [\cite=lovasz]. We mention also applications of Theorem [\ref=khall] and Corollary [\ref=hetei] by Fournier to planar tailings. [\cite=fournier].

Let A and B be finite subsets of a group G. The relation R  =  {(x,y)∈B  ×  A | xy∉A} will be called a Wakeford graph. Clearly [formula] for every x∈B and [formula] for every X  ⊂  B.

Clearly a Wakeford pairing from B onto A is just a matching of the relation R. Thus

[formula]

We shall say that the couple (B,A) is matchable if there is a matching from B onto A.

Notice that xy∉A if and only if xya∉Aa. In particular

[formula]

For every x∈B, we have [formula] In particular,

[formula]

Since [formula] Hall's condition in this graph takes the following form:

For every X  ⊂  B, [formula] In particular, we have by König-Hall's Theorem and Corollary [\ref=hetei]:

Let B be a finite subset of a group G with 1∉B and let A be a subset of G with |A| = |B|. Let R  ⊂  B  ×  A be the Wakeford graph. Then

μ(B,A)  ≠  0 if and only if for every X  ⊂  B, [formula]

If μ(B,A) < Δ(R), then there exists a proper subset X  ⊂  B, with [formula]

The Erds-Heilbronn averaging argument

Let G be a group, B  ⊂  G and x∈G. The Erds-Heilbronn function λ is defined by the relation

[formula]

Erds and Heilbronn introduced this function in the abelian case and proved its sub-modularity [\cite=EH]. Olson generalized it to the non-abelian case. We need two properties of this function:

Let B and C be nonempty subsets of a group G such that [formula]. Then,

[formula]

The following lemma will be used later to show that Δ(R) is not small.

Let S and T be finite subsets of a group G with 1∉S and put q = |〈S〉|. Then there is an x∈S such that

[formula]

where κ2  =  κ2(S̃).

In particular, if κ2 = |S| = |T|, then there is an x∈S such that

[formula]

Put α  =   max {λT(x):x∈S}.

By the definition of κ2, we have |S̃2|  ≥   min (q - 1,1 + |S| + κ2). Take a subset C of S̃2 such that 1∉C, S  ⊂  C and |C| =  min (q - 2,|S| + κ2)

By ( [\ref=eq:clique]) and ( [\ref=eq:x+y]),

[formula]

Thus [formula]

Assume first that |S| + κ2  ≤  q - 2. Then |C| = |S| + κ2 and hence [formula]

Assume now that |S| + κ2  >  q - 2. Then |C| = q - 2 and hence [formula]

Isoperimetric Preliminaries

For a subset X  ⊂  G, we shall write [formula] and [formula]

Let T and S be subsets of a group G with 1∈S. We put [formula] and [formula] Clearly [formula] is a partition. We shall write [formula] Clearly [formula] otherwise there exist z∈TS and y∈S such that zy- 1 = x∈T, and hence [formula] a contradiction. Hence

[formula]

The last observation, used extensively in the isoperimetric method, contains a useful duality.

Recall the following result:

[\cite=hejc2] [\cite=hast] Let S be a finite subset of a group with 1∈S. Then there is a finite subgroup L  ≠  〈S〉 generated by a subset of S such that κ1(S) =  min (|LS| - |L|,|SL| - |L|).

κ1(S̃) = |S|, for any finite Chowla subset S.

By Theorem [\ref=Cay], for some finite subgroup L  ≠  〈S〉, generated by a nonempty subset of S, we have κ1(S̃) =  min (|LS̃| - |L|,|S̃L| - |L|)  ≥  |S|, if |L| = 1. Assume that |L|  ≥  2. Since 1∈S, we have min (|LS|,|SL|)  ≥  2|L|. Thus κ1(S̃) =  min (|LS| - |L|,|SL| - |L|)  ≥  |L|  ≥  |S| + 1, contradicting the obvious inequality κ1(S̃)  ≤  |S|.

We need also the following more precise result:

Let S be a finite Chowla subset. Then S̃ is either a Vosper's subset or a progression.

Let us mention that the notions of left and right progressions coincide for a subset containing 1. For this reason we shall formulate some results using translate copies of sets.

An inverse theorem for cofinite subsets

Inverse Theory (including the isoperimetric approach) deals only with finite sets. In this section, we derive an inverse theorem for cofinite sets.

Let S be a finite Cauchy subset of a group G with 1∈S. Let T be a cofinite subset of G with [formula] Then |∂S(T)|  ≥  |S| - 1 and

[formula]

Assuming moreover that S is a Vosper's subset and that |∂S(T)| = |S| - 1. Then

[formula]

Put and Z = TS and H = 〈S〉. Take a left-decomposition [formula] modulo H, where [formula] for some zi∈Z. By ([\ref=id0]),

[formula]

and hence [formula] By the definition of κ1, we have |ZiS- 1| = |(z- 1i)ZiS- 1|  ≥   min (|H|,|Zi| + |S| - 1) = |Zi| + |S| - 1. Therefore [formula] Thus we have by ([\ref=id0]), j(|S| - 1)  ≤  |∂-S(Z)|  ≤  |∂S(T)|  ≤  |S| - 1. Thus j = 1, proving ([\ref=cf1]). We have also

[formula]

Assume now that S is a Vosper's subset and that |∂S(T)|  ≤  |S| - 1. By ([\ref=idff]), |S| - 1  ≤  |∂-S(TS)|  ≤  |∂S(T)|  ≤  |S| - 1.

In particular, |(TS)S- 1| = |TS| + |∂-S(TS)| = |(TS)| + |S| - 1, proving ([\ref=cf3]).

By ([\ref=idff]) and ([\ref=id0]),

[formula]

We can now show that Chowla subsets behave nicely with respect to matchability.

Let B be a finite Chowla subset of a group G. If A be a subset of G with |A| = |B|, then μ(B,A)  ≠  0.

Let X be a an arbitrary subset of B. Put H = 〈X〉 and  = U. Clearly U is a Chowla subset. By Corollary [\ref=cchowla], U is a Cauchy subset. Put [formula] and W = VU.

By Proposition [\ref=cf], [formula] By Lemma [\ref=KHC], μ(B,A)  ≠  0.

In particular,

Let B be a finite subset of a group G with 1∉B and let A be a subset of G with |A| = |B|.

If |B| < p(G), then μ(B,A)  ≠  0.

Applied to groups with a prime order, the last result reduces to a result of Losonczy [\cite=los]. Also in the case of torsion free groups, it reduces to a result of Eliahou-Lecouvey [\cite=el] generalizing to the non-abelian case results of Wakeford [\cite=wak] and Losonczy [\cite=los].

Distinct matchings

The Vosper's property implies a bound the number of distinct matchings. We shall illustrate this relation in the easier case of Chowla subsets.

Let B be a finite Chowla subset of a group G let A be a subset of G with |A| = |B|. Let R  ⊂  B  ×  A be the Wakeford graph. Then one of the following holds:

μ(B,A)  ≥   max {Δ(R),Δ- 1(R)}.

For some a∈A, [formula]

For some a∈A, Aa- 1 is a progression.

Suppose that (i) is not satisfied. By Lemma [\ref=KHC], for some proper subset X of B, we have [formula] where  = U and [formula]

Put H = 〈X〉 and W = VU. Take w∈W.

By Proposition [\ref=cf], |∂U(V)| = |U| - 1 = |X|. By ([\ref=cf2]),

[formula]

Assume first that |W| = 1, and hence W = {w}. Notice that w∈A- 1. We have clearly Aw = U. Thus |A| = |U| = |X| + 1 and hence |X| = |B| - 1. Therefore [formula] and (ii) holds. Assume |W|  ≥  2. By Theorem [\ref=vchowla], we have one of the two possibilities:

U is an r-progression, for some r.

By ([\ref=cf3]), |UW- 1| = |W| + |U| - 1 = |A|  ≤  |H| - 1. It follows that W- 1w is a progression and hence UW- 1 = Aw is a progression. Thus (iii) holds.

U is a Vosper subset.

Then clearly |X|  ≥  |U| - 1  ≥  2, (since a subset of size 2is not a Vosper's subset). Choose r∈X.

By ([\ref=cf3]), |UW- 1| = |W| + |U| - 1 = |A|  ≤  |H| - 1. Since U is a Vosper's subset of H, we must have |A| = |UW- 1| = |H| - 1. By ([\ref=cf1]), A  ⊂  Hw, and hence [formula] But |〈r〉|  ≥  |A| + 1 = |H|, and hence H = 〈r〉. Since H is cyclic, any subset of H with size |H| - 1 is a progression. Thus Aw- 1 is a progression and (iii) holds

Let B be a Chowla subset with q = |〈B〉|. Then one of the following conditions holds:

[formula]

For some a∈B, Ba- 1 is a progression.

Let R  ⊂  B  ×  A be the Wakeford graph. Suppose that (i) and (ii) are false. By ([\ref=ehol]) and ([\ref=deg]), [formula] By Theorem [\ref=mcp], for some a∈B, [formula]

Since a  ≠  1, we have |B{1,a}| = |B| + 1. Since |B| is less than the order of a, B is an a-progression. Thus Ba- 1 is a progression, a contradiction.
