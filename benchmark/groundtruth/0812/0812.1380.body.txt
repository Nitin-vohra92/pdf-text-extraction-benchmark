Multiple equivalent matings with the aeroplane polynomial

Dedicated to the memory of Adrien Douady

Introduction

Mating of polynomials is a construction invented by A. Douady and J.H. Hubbard in the 1980's, soon after their seminal work on the structure of the Mandelbrot set for quadratic polynomials ([\cite=D-H1] [\cite=D-H2]). The construction is of a rational map [formula] from any two given critically finite quadratic polynomials f1 and f2, apart from some restrictions on (f1,f2) which are (with hindsight) very natural and simple. The construction suggests that the intricacy of structure of the parameter space of quadratic polynomials is, at the very least, reproduced in the parameter space of rational maps. Given that the coordinates of a mating are polynomials, one might expect a product structure of some sort in the space of rational maps. It has been known for some time (from unpublished work of Adam Epstein) that this cannot be true in any strong topological sense. But the way in which the structure translates to the parameter space of rational maps is even more interesting than might at first appear. This has been one aspect of an extensive study. See, for example [\cite=R1] [\cite=R2] [\cite=R3] [\cite=R5] [\cite=R6]. In the current work, we avoid direct reference to such theory, and present some examples. The construction of these examples is self-contained, although they were found during a larger exploration of the theory. We show that, even if we restrict to a single choice of f1, the so-called aeroplane polynomial, the map

[formula]

is unboundedly many-to-one. Thus, a critically finite quadratic rational map can be realised as a mating of the aeroplane polynomial with another polynomial in arbitrarily many ways. We also obtain a similar result for . The capture construction probably first appears in written form in Wittner's 1988 thesis [\cite=W], but was studied by the Hubbard group earlier in the 1980's. (The term, "capture" is used here in a more restrictive sense than is sometimes the case. The precise definition will be given later.) The capture [formula] is a critically finite quadratic rational map made from a critically finite quadratic polynomial f and a path βx from the fixed critical point ∞   of f, which crosses the Julia set of f just once, at a point x in the boundary of a preperiodic Fatou component, and ends at the precritical point in that Fatou component. As in the case of the mating construction, there are some extra, natural and easily stated restrictions. One of the constant refrains of [\cite=R1] [\cite=R2] [\cite=R3] [\cite=R5] [\cite=R6] is that "type III" maps, of which captures are examples, are technically easier to work with than "type IV" maps, of which matings are examples. It is therefore no surprise that the mating result is essentially obtained from the capture result. The way in which this is done is reminiscent of argument in [\cite=R1]. It is not difficult and may indicate that more general theoretical results can be obtained in the same way.

I should like to thank the referee for full and prompt engagement with the paper, and for some helpful comments.

Lamination maps

We use the notation and conventions of [\cite=R5]. This means, in particular, that we work with the lamination map which is Thurston equivalent to the aeroplane polynomial, rather than with the aeroplane polynomial itself. We call this lamination map s3 / 7. It preserves the unit disc, unit circle and exterior of the unit disc. On the exterior of the unit disc, s3 / 7(z) = z2, and on the interior of the unit disc s3 / 7 preserves a lamination known as L3 / 7, and also preserves the set of complementary components of [formula] in the unit disc. This lamination is an example of a . It is a closed set of disjoint chords, or , in the unit disc. of a lamination L in the unit disc means that:

whenever there is a leaf of L joining z1 and z2, there is also a leaf of L joining z21 and z22;

whenever there is a chord joining z1 and z2, there are points ±  z3 and ±  z4 with z23 = z1 and z24 = z2, and such that there are leaves of L joining z3 to z4, and - z3 to - z4.

The label 3 / 7 on L3 / 7 means that the (common) image of the two longest leaves of L3 / 7 has one endpoint at e2πi(3 / 7). This image is known as the of L3 / 7. The other endpoint of the minor leaf is at e2πi(4 / 7). In what follows, we only consider invariant laminations in which every leaf has exactly two preimages. Such an invariant lamination is uniquely determined by its minor leaf. We therefore write L3 / 7 = L4 / 7 and s3 / 7 = s4 / 7. The minor leaf is periodic under s3 / 7, of period 3. It is adjacent to a unique complementary component of [formula] in the unit disc, also known as a of [formula], which is also of period three. The gap adjacent to the minor leaf has a connected preimage under s3 / 7. this connected preimage contains 0 and is known as the , since it maps with degree two onto its image. It then maps homeomorphically on the rest of the cycle, and returns to itself under s33 / 7 with degree two. This is consistent with s3 / 7 having a unique critical point in the unit disc at 0, and this critical point being of period 3. We choose s3 / 7 like this.

More generally, Lp and sp are uniquely determined in the same way, for any odd denominator rational p in

[formula]

Captures and matings

For any path β, we define a homeomorphism σβ, up to isotopy of a suitable type. The definition can be made for any path, but since we only need the definition for paths which are arcs, we only give the definition for these. This homeomorphism σβ is the identity outside a suitably small disc neighbourhood of β, and maps the startpoint of β to the endpoint, as shown in Figure 1.

A is a path from ∞   to a nonperiodic point x in the backward orbit of the (periodic) point 0 which crosses the unit circle just once, into a gap of Lp and ending at x, with no intersections with Lp. A is then a branched covering of the form [formula] for a capture path β. Such a branched covering is critically finite, with critical points at 0 and ∞   and critical values at sp(0) and x, the endpoint of β. Then 0 is periodic under [formula], and the critical point x is eventually mapped by [formula] to the periodic orbit of 0. We refer to such a degree two branched covering, with one critical point periodic, and the other nonperiodic, but in the backward orbit of the first, as being .

In this paper, we only consider captures by s3 / 7, which, up to equivalence, are , since they can equally well be described (up to equivalence) by capture paths in the dynamical plane of the aeroplane polynomial, that is, paths which cross the Julia set of the aeroplane polynomial just once. By the result of Tan Lei, or at least the technique of it ([\cite=TL], see also [\cite=R1]) a capture [formula] is Thurston equivalent to a quadratic rational map (which is unique up to Möbius conjugation) if and only if the endpoint x of the path is a point in the full orbit of 0 which is in the larger region of the unit disc bounded by the leaf of L3 / 7 with endpoints at e±  2πi(1 / 3). This means that the crossing point by the capture path of the unit circle is at e2πiy for [formula]. In section 2.8 of [\cite=R5], elementary equivalences between different captures by s3 / 7 were discussed, for capture paths with the same endpoint. It was shown that any two captures [formula] and [formula], such that β1 and β2 have the same endpoint, are Thurston equivalent, except when the common endpoint of the paths is in the region of the unit disc bounded between the leaves with endpoints e±  2πi(1 / 3), and endpoints e±  2πi(2 / 7). In the exceptional case, [formula] and [formula] are still Thurston equivalent if β1 and β2 have the same endpoint, and if the S1-crossing points e2πiy1 and e2πiy2 are such that y1 and y2 are both in [formula], or both in [formula]. An example was given in 9.2 of [\cite=R5] of capture paths β1 and β2 with different endpoints, with crossing points e2πiy1 and e2πiy2 with [formula] and [formula], such that [formula] and [formula] are Thurston equivalent. It was also shown in the "easy" Main Theorem of [\cite=R5] (2.10 and 6.1) that captures with different endpoints are not Thurston equivalent except when the endpoints are in the region bounded by the leaves joining e±  2πi(1 / 3) and e±  (2πi(2 / 7). (This is essentially a folklore result if the crossing point e2πiy satisfies [formula], but not so if [formula].) A detailed analysis of the for the aeroplane polynomial

[formula]

-- where

[formula]

and on the range is Thurston equivalence -- will be given in [\cite=R6]. The purpose of the present paper is simply to give examples to show that the fibres of this capture map -- that is, the sets of equivalent captures -- can be arbitrarily large.

We also describe matings only up to Thurston equivalence. For (quadratic) lamination maps sp and sq, the [formula] of sp and sq is the branched covering defined by

[formula]

We are only considering, here, the case of [formula]. It follows from Tan Lei's Theorem ([\cite=TL] [\cite=R1]) that [formula] is Thurston equivalent to a quadratic rational map (unique up to Möbius conjugacy) if and only if [formula]. As in the case of captures, it is essentially a folklore result that, for [formula], branched coverings [formula] and [formula] are Thurston equivalent if and only if sq1 = sq2, that is, e2πiq1 and e2πiq2 are endpoints of the same minor leaf (so that Lq1 = Lq2). It is likely that the corresponding result for [formula] is true, and can be proved from the analogous result for captures. It is hoped to include a proof of this in another paper in the near future. For [formula], this is far from true, as the result of this paper shows.

There is a way of describing lamination maps sq and matings up to Thurston equivalence using homeomorphisms σβ, which has been used in [\cite=R1] and [\cite=R2] and which will be useful here, too. First we describe sq up to Thurston equivalence, for any odd denominator rational q in (0,1). Let s0 denote the map s0(z) = z2. Suppose that e2πiq has period r under s0. Let β be an arc from 0 to a point near e2πiq which does not intersect the unit circle. Let ζ be a similar path from 0 to [formula], which is in a small neighbourhood of s- 10(β). Then the Thurston equivalence class of

[formula]

is uniquely determined, assuming that sufficiently small neighbourhoods were chosen. We can choose β to intersect the minor leaf of Lq exactly once, and ζ so as not to intersect [formula] at all. It is then clear that [formula] preserves Lq up to isotopy, and is Thurston equivalent to sq.

For the similar description of matings, we can describe [formula] as follows, again assuming that e2πiq is of period r under s0. We take β to be a path from ∞   to a small neighbourhood of e- 2πiq (not e2πiq, because the identification with the unit disc is by z  ↦  z- 1) which does not cross the unit circle, and let ζ a path from ∞   to a small neighbourhood of [formula] which is in a small neighbourhood of s- 1p(β). Then

[formula]

is Thurston equivalent to [formula].

The Mating and Capture Theorems

We shall prove the following.

Symbolic Dynamics

In order to identify points in S1, and leaves and gaps of L3 / 7, and, in order to do our calculations, we shall use the the symbolic dynamics for s3 / 7 which is used in [\cite=R5] and [\cite=R6], with letters Lj and Rj for 1  ≤  j  ≤  3, and C, BC and UC. The labels on regions are as shown. The vertical lines separating regions join points e±  2πi(r / 14) on the unit circle, for 1  ≤  r  ≤  6. We use D(Lj), D(Rj) and D(C) to denote the closures of the regions labelled by Lj, Rj or C. We define

[formula]

[formula]

Under the map s3 / 7, regions map as follows:

[formula]

Each D(Rj) or D(Lj) is mapped homeomorphically by s3 / 7 onto its image, while D(C) is mapped with degree two onto D(L1) by s3 / 7. Each of D(BC),D(UC) is also mapped onto D(L1).

If [formula] is a word in the letters Lj, Rj, BC, UC and C then we define

[formula]

We can make a similar definition for infinite words, in which case D(w) is a point on the unit circle S1, or a leaf of L3 / 7, or the closure of a gap of L3 / 7. We define

[formula]

and

[formula]

If z is the point of Z∞   of lowest preperiod in D(w), then we write z = p(w) and we sometimes write D(z) for D(w).

We shall often consider words which contain only the letters L3, L2 and R3, possibly with C at the end. For any such word w, D(w) is bounded in the unit disc by vertical chords. For such words, we shall use the notation v < w if D(v) is to the right of D(w) in the unit disc. We shall avoid this notation in the case when v is a prefix of w or vice versa. We shall also sometimes write v  ≤  w, meaning that v < w or v = w. For such a word w, we shall write β(w) for a capture path ending at p(w) and crossing into D(w) on the upper unit circle. The exact crossing point does not matter, because all such paths are homotopic via homotopies which fix the forward orbit of p(w).

Proofs

The basic idea

The following lemma is the basic idea. The rest of the proof of the capture and mating theorems is obtained by variations on this.

Write s3 / 7 = s from now on. We omit the index 0 and simply write v, w and u for v0, w0 and u0. So take x = p(wu) and y = p(vu). Then D(y) is to the right of D(x), although both are in D(L3L2R3L3). Note, also, that p(u) is in the forward orbit under s of x and y, and there is no other point in the forward orbit of y which is between D(y) and D(x). So now we take the subdisc D' of the unit disc which is bounded by D(x) and D(y). It does not matter whether we choose D' to contain D(x) (or D(y)) or not, because we are only concerned with the isotopy class with respect to the strict forward orbit of y but we will choose it to be strictly between D(x) and D(y). Choose a point z∈Z∞   whose word starts with L3, and contains only the letters L3, L2 and R3 such that z is not in [formula], and D(z) is to the right of D(y). We are now going to use [formula] as a base for the construction. The exact position of z does not matter.

Let α be the simple loop based at z, which crosses out of the gap containing z on the upper unit circle, then crosses back to trace round D' in an anti-clockwise direction, crosses out on the upper boundary of the unit circle and then back across the upper unit circle into the gap containing z and then ends at z. Let

[formula]

and similarly for any other point replacing z. Note that p(u) = s8(y) = s8(x) is of preperiod 5 under s, and so [formula]. and for any m  ≥  5, we have [formula]. Now for any m  ≥  5 we can find a homeomorphism

[formula]

such that

[formula]

where this notation ≃ψm (which is also used in [\cite=R1] [\cite=R2] [\cite=R3] [\cite=R5] [\cite=R6]) means that [formula] and [formula] are homotopic via a homotopy through critically finite branched coverings which all take the same values on [formula]. In particular, [formula] and [formula] are Thurston equivalent. Of course, Thurston equivalence is an equivalence relation, while ≃ψm is not. Nevertheless this notation gives useful information. Similarly to [\cite=R5], (3.3, 6.3 or 8.1) we can define ψm by induction on m, setting ψ5 to be the identity. Then we define ψm + 1 in terms of ψm for m  ≥  5 by

[formula]

together with the property that ψm + 1 is isotopic to ψm via an isotopy which is the identity on [formula], which contains O(p(u)). It is then also true that ψm and ψm + 1 are isotopic via an isotopy which is the identity on [formula]. Defining ξm by

[formula]

we have

[formula]

and, for m  ≥  5,

[formula]

We then have

[formula]

We need ψm for m equal to the preperiod of y (so m = 13 in this case, which is also the preperiod of x), up to isotopy preserving [formula]. For such an m, we write ψm  =  ψ. Now each ξk is a composition of disc- exchanging involutions. We see this first for ξ5  =  ψ6, which is a single involution whose support is an arbitrarily small neighbourhood of

[formula]

that is, approximately the union of s- 1(D') and the diagonal in the exterior of the unit disc connecting these. The involution interchanges the components of s- 1(D') -- tracing a path halfway round the boundary of the supporting disc in a direction. This ensures that ξ- 15  =  ψ- 16 exchanges discs, tracing a path halfway round the boundary of the supporting disc in an direction. Similarly we have

[formula]

We only need to consider the components of the support of ξk which intersect O(y). Note that the support of ξ5 does not intersect α, although it does intersect β(z) near ∞  . We shall see inductively that, for all 6  ≤  k  ≤  12, the components of ξk which intersect O(y) do not intersect [formula], but do intersect O(x). So we have

[formula]

and for 6  ≤  k  ≤  12,

[formula]

We can describe the involutions using the symbolic dynamics. The involution of ξ5 is described by

[formula]

The support of ξ5 thus contains just the points p(L3u) and p(R3u) in O(x) and O(y) respectively. We have the following components in the support of ξk for 5  ≤  k  ≤  12. In each case, two discs u1D' and u2D' are connected by an arc in the exterior of the unit disc. The labels "top" and "bot" indicate whether the arc joins onto the disc ujD' on the upper or lower half of the unit circle. We then only need to consider the components of the support of ξk which intersect O(y). Now p(u) is the only point in D' in the forward orbit of y (and x), and it turns out that a single component of the support of ξk contains the points in the backward orbit of both x and y which map forward under sk + 1 to u. For 6  ≤  k  ≤  11, the action of ξk is represented by:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

and finally, for k = 12:

[formula]

The support of this last component contains both x and y, and interchanges them. Define the path γ1 by

[formula]

where *   denotes the usual composition of paths. So the endpoints of γ1 are z and y. We may take this as a pointwise definition of γ1, but we are only interested in γ1 up to homotopy preserving O(y) and O(z). Up to such a homotopy, the path γ1 is an arc which crosses out of the gap containing z across the upper unit circle then into the gap containing y, again across the upper unit circle, and ends at y. Then we write

[formula]

Then

[formula]

None of the involutions in the support of ψ intersects γ1, except for the one in the support of ξ12 which interchanges the discs D(x) and D(y), with connecting arc along the lower unit circle. So the endpoints of γ2 are z and x. Because this disc exchange (like all of them) is in a clockwise direction, ψ(γ1) passes to the left of D(y), while α passes to the right of vD1' where D1'  ⊂  D' is defined by [formula]. However [formula]. Note that when discs are exchanged, upper boundaries go to upper boundaries, and lower boundaries to lower. So ψ(γ1) hooks round wD1', but [formula] -- because [formula]. So

[formula]

and

[formula]

Extensions of [\ref=2.1]

Write

[formula]

It is clear that the pair (a,b) plays a key role in [\ref=2.1]. Note that

[formula]

The following properties hold.

The words v0 and w0 contain only the letters L3, L2 and R3, and u0 contains only the letters L3, L2 and R3 apart from the last letter C.

We have

[formula]

and u0 is the only suffix u of v0u0 which satisfies

[formula]

and w0u0 is obtained from v0u0 by changing the word a preceding u0 in v0u0 to b.

These are essentially the only properties of u0, v0 and w0 which are used in the proof of [\ref=2.1]. We want words v0 and w0 such that D(v0) and D(w0) are in the subset of the unit disc bounded by the leaves of L3 / 7 with endpoints at e±  2πi(2 / 7) and e±  2πi(1 / 3). This will be true provided that the common prefix starts with L2i + 13L2 for some i  ≥  0.

This motivates the following. We choose the words c and d to minimise the preperiods and periods in the Capture and Mating Theorems for all n  ≥  1. Of course other choices are possible. Let a and b be as above and let v0, w0 and u0 be as in [\ref=2.1]. In addition define

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

and define vk, wk, tk and uk inductively for k  ≥  1 by

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

We write |v| for the number of letters in a word v. Note that, for k  ≥  1,

[formula]

[formula]

and so

[formula]

[formula]

and for n  ≥  1 (not n = 0)

[formula]

So we have

[formula]

for all n  ≥  1, and

[formula]

for all n  ≥  0. This will give the numbers in the Capture and Mating Theorems.

vk, uk and wk satisfy the conditions 1--2 of [\ref=2.2].

Each of a, b, c, d, and u0 has an odd number of letters L3 and L2. Hence, the same is true for v0, w0 and t0, which are obtained by prefixing a, b and d by L3L2R3. Hence, by induction, the same is true of vk, wk, uk and tk for all k  ≥  0. Since the words vk, wk, uk and tk for k > 0 are obtained from a, b, c and d by adjoining the common prefix vk - 1tk - 1, which has an even number of letters L3 and L2, and since

[formula]

we have

[formula]

and, for all k > 0,

[formula]

Then, for k > 1, since tk - 1 < uk - 1 we have vk - 1uk - 1 < vk - 1tk - 1, and

[formula]

Now the only condition of [\ref=2.2] that needs to be checked is that uk is the only suffix u of vkuk satisfying vkuk < u < wkuk. Since vk - 1tk - 1 is a common prefix of vk and wk, we only need to consider proper suffixes of vkuk which start with vk - 1tk - 1. To do this, we prove something more general about occurrences of vk - 1tk - 1.

The only occurrences of vk - 1tk - 1 in

[formula]

are those visible in the definitions of vk, tk and uk above, that is, at the start of these words.

Proof We prove this by induction on k. We can easily check that it is true for k = 1, by inspection. Now suppose that it is true for k - 1. Now vk - 1tk - 1 starts with vk - 1, which starts with vk - 2tk - 2. Now

[formula]

So any occurrence of vk - 1tk - 1 in any of the words of ([\ref=2.4.1]) contains a vk - 2tk - 2 which must be in one of the corresponding words for k - 2 and must coincide with the start of one of the words vk - 1, tk - 1 or uk - 1. Then by inspection we see that the only possibility for vk - 1tk - 1 in any of the words of ([\ref=2.4.1]) is at the start of one of the subwords vk, tk or uk.

We then have the following corollary.

For vk, wk and uk defined as above, the captures [formula] and [formula] are Thurston equivalent.

Define y = p(vkuk) and x = p(wkuk) similarly to [\ref=2.1], and define α, D', γ1 and γ2 as in [\ref=2.1]. As before, choose z to the right of D(y) and to the left of D(C), and outside [formula]. Let m = |vk| = 13  ·  2k - 5. Let S be the local inverse of sm defined by vk, so that Sp(uk)) = x. Then [formula] intersects [formula], but, by [\ref=2.3], it does not contain any points of O(x) apart from x itself. Then we can choose z arbitrarily close to [formula], and on the right of this set. Then define the sequences of homeomorphisms ψm and [formula] as in [\ref=2.1]. We need to consider the effect of disc exchanges in the support of [formula] on γ1, as in [\ref=2.1]. We only need to consider those which pull back to ones which intersect γ1, and which also intersect O(y). The first few disc exchanges are as in [\ref=2.1]. The rest are all of the form u'aD'  ↔  u'bD', where u' is a prefix of uk, and, also, u'auk is a suffix of vkuk, that is, u'a is a suffix of vk. By the conditions imposed on z, it is never in either of the sets u'aD' or u'bD', and is only strictly between them if D' is also. So γ1 does not intersect the disc exchange given by u'aD'  ↔  u'bD', if y is not in [formula], and y is not between u'aD' and u'bD'. So there is no intersection, except possibly when u'a is a suffix of vk = vk - 1tk - 1a, and u' is a prefix of vk. So now we consider when this can happen. Take the largest i such that viti is a (not necessarily proper) prefix of u', and hence also a prefix of vk. Then by [\ref=2.4], the only occurrences of viti in vk - 1tk - 1 are those in the subwords vi + 1 and ti + 1 which occur in the construction of vk - 1 and tk - 1. So the only possibility is that u' = vk - 1tk - 1 and u'a = vk. This gives the disc exchange vkD'  ↔  wkD', which has exactly the right effect on γ1, as in [\ref=2.1].

To obtain equivalences between more than two captures, we need a slight generalisation. For n > k, define wk,n and uk,n and tk,n by replacing every occurrence of a which precedes a word vk in vn - or un - by b. Note that by [\ref=2.4], applied to vk - 1tk - 1 every occurrence of vk in these longer words is indeed preceded by a, since d = L23a.

The suffixes u of vnun which satisfy vnun < u < wk,nuk,n are precisely those which start with vk or tk.

We consider the case k = 0 since the proofs are exactly similar. It is clear that we only need to consider prefixes which start with v0 or t0. Every suffix u which starts with t0 certainly satisfies vn < u < w0,n, because w0,n starts with w0 and vn starts with v0. So there is only a question about suffixes which start with v0, and all of these start with v0t0, and hence with either v1 = v0t0a or with t1 = v0t0d -- or with u1 = v0t1c if n = 1. So then we are reduced to considering suffixes which start with v1. Continuing in the same way, we see that all suffices which start with vr for any 1  ≤  r < n or with un have the required property.

The following completes the proof of the theorem for captures.

[formula] and [formula] are Thurston equivalent.

We consider n > k  ≥  0 since [\ref=2.1] covers the case k = n = 0, and [\ref=2.5] covers k = n in general. We consider the case k = 0 since the other cases are exactly similar for any k < n. By [\ref=2.6], the points in the forward orbit of p(vnun) that are between p(vnun) and p(w0,nun) are precisely the points p(u) for all suffixes u of vnun which start with v0 or t0.

Once again, we proceed much as in [\ref=2.1] -- and [\ref=2.5]. Similarly to there, we define

[formula]

We define D' to be the region strictly between D(w0,n) and D(vnun). Choose z as in [\ref=2.5], but with S being the local inverse defined by vk. This is still possible, using [\ref=2.6] rather than [\ref=2.3]. As in [\ref=2.1], we let α be the anticlockwise loop based at z round D', we define γ1 by β(z) * γ1  =  β(y), and proceed to define ξk and ψm as in [\ref=2.1]. As in [\ref=2.1], we want to prove that, for ψ  =  ψm and m = |vn|  +  |un| - 1 = 26.un - 11,

[formula]

By the same argument as in [\ref=2.5], the only disc exchanges u'aD'  ↔  u'bD' which have to be considered are those for which [formula] and y∈D(u'). By [\ref=2.6] these are those for which u'aw is a suffix of vnun, where w is a suffix of vnun which starts with v0 or t0, and u' is also a prefix of vnun. Using [\ref=2.4], we see that the possibilities are u'aw must be a suffix of vnun which starts with vi or ti for some i > 0, or (if n = 1) with u1. All such disc exchanges are properly contained in D', and do not intersect [formula].

This time, in contrast to [\ref=2.1] and [\ref=2.5], there are many disc exchanges intersecting D' and γ1, along the lower unit circle and the upper unit circle. The occurrences of v0t0 in vnun are separated by strings of the form dra for a variable integer r  ≥  0. The number of letters L3 and L2 in dra is odd or even, depending on whether r is even or odd, but each of v0 and d0 has an odd number of letters L3 and L2, and, apart from the very first occurrence of v0, each occurrence of v0 or t0 in vnun is always preceded by a. Now every exchange ξj along the lower unit circle introduces a double hook in ψj + 1(γ1), and every exchange ξj along the upper unit circle is such that ψj + 1(γ1) and ψj(γ1) have the same number of hooks, and the last hook on ψj + 1(γ1) is a reduction of the last hook on ψj(γ1). The picture shows [formula], where [formula] is the first [formula] for which [formula], so that [formula] (see [\ref=2.2]). Note that [formula] is to the right of x. If [formula] is the first [formula] for which [formula], so that [formula], then [formula] is to the right of x, and the last hook is round x. In order to obtain ([\ref=2.7.1]), we need the upward-pointing hooks on ψ(γ1), that is, those which have the hook bridging the upper unit circle, to be homotopically trivial relative to O(x). This is true, because all the upward pointing hooks are round subsets of ψ(D1') where (as in [\ref=2.1]) [formula] is to the right of D', and [formula] by [\ref=2.6]. Therefore [formula]. So we do have ([\ref=2.7.1]), and, as in [\ref=2.1], this gives the desired equivalence.

Proof of the Matings Theorem

The proof of the Matings Theorem is then completed by the following lemma.

We start by considering the case k = 0 = n. Write q0,0 = q0 and q1,0 = q1 Note that r0 = t0. As in [\ref=2.1], we drop the index 0 and write

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Note that the common length of vt and wt is 18, and so in this particular case we are establishing an equivalence between matings with the aeroplane for which the second critical point has period 18.

We define

[formula]

and

[formula]

Then x and y have preperiod 33. As before, we write s3 / 7 = s.

Choose a path ζ(y) from ∞   to p(R3vu) which crosses the unit circle just once, in the upper boundary of the gap of L3 / 7 containing p(R3vu), then stays in this gap, and ends at p(R3vu). Then, using the description of [formula] up to Thurston equivalence given at the end of [\ref=1.3],

[formula]

This is because the gap of L3 / 7 containing the point sj(y), for 0  ≤  j  ≤  17, is closer to exp (2πi2jq1) than any other point si(y) for 0  ≤  i  ≤  17 . Defining γ1 by β(z) * γ1  =  β(y) as before, we also have

[formula]

Similarly, define ζ(x) ending at p(R3wu), so that we have

[formula]

We are going to proceed much as in previous results, in particular, as in [\ref=2.1]. So let D' be the subset of the unit disc between D(x) and D(y), and let z∈Z∞ be such that D(z) is to the right of D(x), and

[formula]

Let α be the anticlockwise loop based at z and round D'. As in [\ref=2.1], we have a homeomorphism ψ  =  ψ33 such that

[formula]

We have

[formula]

Now the postcritical set P(y) of [formula] is

[formula]

Note that it does not include p(vu), and similarly the postcritical set P(x) of [formula] does not include p(wu). So to prove the lemma, we only need to prove that

[formula]

[formula]

The proof of ([\ref=2.8.1]) is much as in [\ref=2.1] and [\ref=2.7]. The support of [formula] intersects [formula] only for [formula] and [formula]. In both cases, just one component of the support of [formula] intersects [formula], and restricted to this component, [formula] exchanges two discs. The homeomorphism ξ14 interchanges a disc containing p(vu) and p(vtvu) with a disc containing p(wu) and p(wtvu), with p(vu) and p(vtvu) mapped to p(wu) and p(wtvu) respectively, and ξ32 interchanges a disc containing p(wtvu) with a disc containing p(wtwu). Figure 6 shows α  *  ψ15(β(y)) and α  *  ψ33(β(y)). The endpoint of ψ15(β(y)) is p(wtvu) and the endpoint of ψ33(β(y)) is p(wtwu) = x. Both of these paths loop round p(wu) as shown (but because of space constraints, this point is not labelled). Since p(wu) = s18(p(x)) is not in P(x), this does not matter, and we have ([\ref=2.8.1]) in the case n = 0.

Now we consider ([\ref=2.8.2]). The action of ξ7  =  ψ8 on ζ(y) is as shown in Figure 7. Note that the support of ξ7 intersects ζ(y) but does not contain p(R3vu) because [formula], because we chose u with t < u, and therefore vu < vt. The two discs in the support of ξ7 interchange in a clockwise direction round ∞  , and the action on ζ(y) is such that ξ7(ζ(y)) hooks round the nearby component of s- 1(D'). The points p(L3u) and p(R3u) in s- 1(D') are interchanged by ξ7. Then there is a composition of disc exchanges similar to those in [\ref=2.1]. The support of [formula] does not intersect ψ8(ζ(y)) for [formula] but does intersect it for [formula]. The endpoint of ψ16(ζ(y)) is then at p(R3wu). For [formula], the discs in the support of [formula] contain only points of preperiod higher than 16, and 16 is the preperiod of p(R3wu). The discs are sufficiently small that any such disc which intersects ψ16(ζ(y)) does not intersect P(x). In particular, ψ33(ζ(y)) is homotopic to ψ16(y) relative to P(x). This gives ([\ref=2.8.2]) in the case k = 0. The case k = n, for any n  ≥  0, of ([\ref=2.8.1]) and ([\ref=2.8.2]), is exactly similar.

So now we consider the case n > k  ≥  0. Write

[formula]

There is a composition of disc exchanges contributing to both ψ(γ1) and ψ(ζ(y)). We consider the disc exchanges affecting γ1, which are similar to those for [\ref=2.7]. However, there is no exchange for the word a preceding vnun in vntnvnun. As in the case k = n = 0, there is a difference from the proof of [\ref=2.7], because this time the disc vkD1' contains the point p(vnun). But this is the only point in O(y) that vkD1' contains, and it is not in P(y). So we have a similar picture to Figure 6, and ([\ref=2.8.1]) holds.

For ζ(y), as before, the first disc exchange which intersects ζ(y) does not move the endpoint, but does create a hook round R3D' exactly as in the picture for the case k = n = 0. The next exchange -- the inverse image of the first one affecting γ1 -- is along the lower unit circle and reduces the size of this hook, replacing it by one of the same shape. As in [\ref=2.7], and as for β(y), the disc exchanges which affect [formula] then alternate between a group of exchanges on the upper and lower unit circle. Finally, for m = 26.2n - 11, we have ψm(ζ(y)) = ζ(x) up to homotopy preserving P(x) and ψm(ζ(y)) = ψ(ζ(y)) up to homotopy preserving P(x). So ([\ref=2.8.2]) holds as before.

Remarks

The pair (a,b) = (L3(L2R3)2,L53) can be varied, to

[formula]

for any j  ≥  1 or

[formula]

for any j  ≥  1.

Let us call such an ordered pair (a,b) an . Note that each a and each b has an odd number of letters L3 and L2. Then if we examine the proof of [\ref=2.7], which works more generally than [\ref=2.1], we see that if y = p(eau) then [formula] and [formula] are Thurston equivalent for some x∈D(eb), whenever the following conditions hold.

[formula] for some [formula].

e consists only of the letters L3, L2 and R3, with an even number of letters L3 and L2.

u consists only of the letters L3, L2 and R3, apart from the last letter C.

No suffix u' of eau satisfies D(u')  ⊂  D(eb).

eau < u < eb, but no suffix u' of eau with |u'|  >  |u| satisfies eau < u' < eb .

Any suffix u' of u with |u'|  <  |u|, which satisfies eaebu < u' < ebu, satisfies the stronger condition eau < u' < ebu.

For any suffix u' of u which satisfies eau < u' < eb, the prefix of u' in u is a1, for some exchangeable pair (a1,b1).

If e'a' is a proper suffix of e for some exchangeable pair (a',b'), such that D(eau) is between D(e'a'eau) and D(e'b'eau), then e' has an even number of letters L3 and L2. Note that this then implies that e'a'eau < eau < e'b'eau.

Once these conditions are satisfied, we can define u1 to be obtained from u by replacing a1 by the second coordinate b1 of the exchangeable pair, for every suffix u' of u with eau < u < eb, where a1 is the first coordinate of the exchangeable pair which precedes u'. Then [formula] and [formula] are Thurston equivalent, where x = p(ebu1). The idea in [\ref=2.7] is to have a word v which can be written in the form eau in many different ways.

This clearly gives a lot of choice, but it is unsatisfactory that the conditions imposed on u are only satisfied by a zero density set of words, as the length tends to infinity. One would like to be able to say that, for a fixed choice of e, and for u in a set of postive density, there exists x∈D(eb) such that [formula] and [formula] are Thurston equivalent. Such questions will be addressed in [\cite=R6].

I am not sure whether or not the growth rate of n equivalent matings or captures with critical point of period or preperiod of O(2n) is the best possible. A related question is on the growth of the length of words v which can be written as eau for n different choices of (e,a,u) where (e,a,u) satisfies the conditions listed above. This growth seems to be O(2n). Once again, it is hoped to address the issue properly in [\cite=R6].
