Introduction

In nonlinear elliptic variational problems involving critical nonlinearities, one of the major difficulties is to recover the compactness of Palais-Smale sequences of the associated Euler-Lagrange functional. Such questions were first studied, in our knowledge, by Brézis and Nirenberg in their well-known work [\cite=BN]. The concentration-compactness principle due to Lions [\cite=PLL] is widely used to overcome these difficulties. Other methods, based on the convergence almost everywhere of the gradients of Palais-Smale sequences, can be also used to recover the compactness. We refer the reader to the papers by Boccardo and Murat [\cite=BM] and by J. M. Rakotoson [\cite=RAK2] for bounded domains. For arbitray domains, we refer to the recent work by A. El Hamidi and J. M. Rakotoson [\cite=ER].

In [\cite=BN], the authors studied the critical perturbation of the eigenvalue problem:

[formula]

where Ω is a bounded domain in [formula], N  ≥  3, with smooth boundary, [formula] is the Sobolev critical exponent of the embedding W1,2(Ω)  ⊂  Lp(Ω), and λ is a positive parameter. The authors introduced an important condition on the level corresponding to the energy of Palais-Smale sequences which guarantees their relative compactness. Indeed, let (un) be a Palais-Smale sequence for the Euler-Lagrange functional

[formula]

More precisely, the authors showed that if

[formula]

then (un) est relatively compact, which implies the existence of nontrivial critical points of Iλ. Here, S denotes the best Sobolev constant in the embedding W1,20(Ω)  ⊂  L2*(Ω). In this work, we begin by giving the generalization of condition ([\ref=seuil]) for the quasilinear equation

[formula]

where Ω is a bounded domain in [formula], N  ≥  3, with smooth boundary [formula], where Γ and Σ are smooth (N - 1)-dimensional submanifolds of ∂Ω with positive measures such that [formula]. Δp is the p-Laplacian and [formula] is the outer normal derivative. Here, f is a subcritical perturbation of |u|p* - 1.

The sharpness of our result is estabished by the construction of suitable Palais-Smale sequences (corresponding to the critical level) which are not relatively compact.

Then we give the analogous condition to ([\ref=seuil]) for a general system with critical exponents

[formula]

together with Dirichlet or mixed boundary conditions, where f and g are subcritical perturbations of |u|p* - 1 and |v|q* - 1 respectively, [formula] (resp. [formula]) is the critical exponent of the Sobolev embedding W1,p(Ω)  ⊂  Lr(Ω) (resp. W1,q(Ω)  ⊂  Lr(Ω)). Our approach provides a general condition based on the Nehari manifold, which can be extended to a large class of critical nonlinear problems. In this work, we confine ourselves to systems involving (p,q) - Laplacian operators and critical nonlinearities. The sharpness of our result is estabished, in the special case p = q, by the construction of suitable Palais-Smale sequences which are not relatively compact. The question of sharpness corresponding to the case p  ≠  q is still open.

For a more complete description of nonlinear elliptic systems, we refer the reader to the papers by De Figueiredo [\cite=FIG1] and by De Figueiredo & Felmer [\cite=FIG2] and the references therein.

A general local compactness result

For the reader's convenience, we start with the scalar case and to render the paper selfcontained we will recall or show some well-known facts.

The scalar case

Let [formula], N  ≥  3, be a bounded domain with smooth boundary ∂Ω. Let [formula] be a function which is measurable in x, continuous in u and satisfying the growt condition at infinity

[formula]

This situation occurs, for example, in the special cases f(x,u)  =  u or f(x,u)  =  uq - 1, 1 < q < p*.

Consider the problem

[formula]

where Ω is a bounded domain in [formula], N  ≥  3, with smooth boundary [formula], where Γ and Σ are smooth (N - 1)-dimensional submanifolds of ∂Ω with positive measures such that [formula]. Problem ([\ref=gen_eq2]) is posed in the framework of the Sobolev space

[formula]

which is the closure of [formula] with respect to the norm of W1,p(Ω). Notice that meas(Γ)  >  0 implies that the Poincaré inequality is still available in W1,pΓ(Ω), so it can be endowed with the norm

[formula]

and (W1,pΓ(Ω),||  .  ||) is a reflexive and separable Banach space. The associated Euler-Lagrange functional is given by

[formula]

the corresponding Euler-Lagrange functional, where [formula].

We recall here that the Nahari manifold associated to the functional Jλ is given by:

[formula]

and it is clear that NJλ contains all nontrivial critical points of Jλ. This manifold can be characterized more explicitely by the following

[formula]

where t  ↦  Jλ(tu) is a function defined from [formula] to itself, for every u given in [formula]. We define the critical level associated to Problem ([\ref=gen_eq2]) by:

[formula]

At this stage, we can state and show our first result

Let [formula] and (un) be a Palais-Smale sequence of Jλ such that

[formula]

Then (un) is relatively compact.

Proof. Let [formula] and (un) be a Palais-Smale sequence for Jλ of level [formula] ((PS)c for short) satisfying the condition ([\ref=elhamidi]). We claim that (un) is bounded in W1,pΓ(Ω). Indeed, on has one hand

[formula]

and

[formula]

Then,

[formula]

Now, let ε > 0, using the growth condition ([\ref=croissance]), there exists c1(ε) > 0 such that

[formula]

Applying the Hölder and the Young inequalities to the last relations, it follows

[formula]

Combining ([\ref=combin]) and ([\ref=niveau]), we deduce that (un) is in fact bounded in W1,pΓ(Ω). So passing, if necessary to a subsequence, we can consider that

[formula]

On the other hand, the growth condition ([\ref=croissance]) implies also that, for almost every x∈Ω, the functions s  ↦  F(x,s) and s  ↦  sf(x,s) satisfy the conditions of the Brézis-Lieb Lemma (see Theorem 2 in [\cite=BL]). Thus, we get the identities

[formula]

Moreover, let ε  >  0, there is c1(ε)  >  0 such that

[formula]

Let C > 0 (which is independent of n and ε), such that ||vn||p*p*  ≤  C. Since (vn) converges strongly to 0 in L1(Ω), there is [formula] such that ||vn||1  ≤  ε  /  c1, for every n  ≥  n0(ε), and consequently

[formula]

In the same way, rewriting [formula] and using the same arguments as above, we deduce that

[formula]

Applying once again the Brézis-Lieb Lemma, we conclude that [formula] and

[formula]

A direct computation gives

[formula]

where

[formula]

Now, let b be the common limit of ||vn||p and ||vn||p*p*. Suppose that b  ≠  0. On one hand we have

[formula]

Then

[formula]

On the other hand, the identity ([\ref=Jzero]) leads to

[formula]

It follows then

[formula]

which contradicts the condition ([\ref=elhamidi]). This achives the proof. [formula]

Sharpness of the critical level formula in the scalar case

To show the sharpness of the critical level formula ([\ref=elhamidi]), it suffices to carry out a Palais-Smale sequence for Jλ of level c*(λ) which contains no convergent subsequence. Consider, for a given ε > 0, the extremal function

[formula]

which attains the best constant S of the Sobolev embedding

[formula]

Without loss of generality, we can consider that 0∈Σ. Moreover, the set ∂Ω satisfies the following property (see more details in Adimurthi, Pacella and Yadava [\cite=APY]): There exist δ > 0, an open neighborhood V of 0 and a diffeomorphism Ψ  :  Bδ(0)  →  V which has a jacobian determinant equal to one at 0, with [formula], where [formula]. Let [formula] such that [formula] in a neighborhood of the origin. We define the sequence defined by

[formula]

It is well known that the sequence (ψn)  ⊂  W1,pΓ(Ω) is a Palais-Smale sequence for J0 of level inf w∈NJ0J0(w), which satisfies

[formula]

Now, let (un) be a Palais-Smale sequence of Jλ of level [formula]. We will not go into further details concerning which subcritical terms f(u) allow the existence of such sequences, but in the litterature, this occurs for various classes of subcritical terms. Applying Theorem [\ref=general], there exists a subsequence, still denoted by (un), which converges to some u∈W1,pΓ(Ω). Then

[formula]

where C a positive constant independent of n. We apply the Brézis-Lieb Lemma to the sequence (un  +  ψn) and get

[formula]

Moreover, one has

[formula]

which implies that

[formula]

Therefore, we conclude that

[formula]

The same argumets applied to the sequence [formula] give

[formula]

Finally, using the fact that

[formula]

where δ0 is the Dirac measure concentrated at the origin and M+(Ω) is the space of positive finite measures [\cite=WIL]), we get that the sequence (un  +  ψn) is a Palais-Smale sequence of Jλ of level c*(λ).

We hence constructed a Palais-Smale sequence (un  +  ψn) of Jλ of level c*(λ) which can not be relatively compact in W1,pΓ(Ω). This justifies the sharpness of the critical level formula ([\ref=elhamidi]).

If we are interested by the homogeneous Dirichlet conditions, i.e. if [formula], the same arguments developed above are still valid, it suffices to assume that the origin 0∈Ω and consider φ∈C∞0(Ω) such that [formula] in a neighborhood of the origin.

The system case

Now, consider the system

[formula]

together with Dirichlet or mixed boundary conditions

[formula]

where, Ω is a bounded domain in [formula], N  ≥  3, with smooth boundary [formula], where Γi and Σi are smooth (N - 1)-dimensional submanifolds of ∂Ω with positive measures such that [formula], i∈{1,2}. Δp is the p-Laplacian and [formula] is the outer normal derivative. Also, it is clear that when Γ1  =  Γ2  =  ∂Ω, one deals with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. We assume here that

[formula]

and the critical condition

[formula]

Indeed, this condition represents the maximal growth such that the integrability of the product term |u|α + 1|v|β + 1 (which will appear in the Euler-Lagrange functional) can be guaranteed by suitable Hölder estimates.

The functions f and g are two caratheodory functions which satisfy the growth conditions

[formula]

Problem ([\ref=syst]), together with ([\ref=mix]), is posed in the framework of the Sobolev space W = W1,pΓ1(Ω)  ×  W1,qΓ2(Ω), where

[formula]

which are respectively the closure of [formula] with respect to the norm of W1,p(Ω) and [formula] with respect to the norm of W1,q(Ω). Notice that meas(Γi)  >  0, i = 1,  2, imply that the Poincaré inequality is still available in W1,pΓ1(Ω) and W1,qΓ2(Ω), so W can be endowed with the norm

[formula]

and (W,||  .  ||) is a reflexive and separable Banach space. The associated Euler-Lagrange functional [formula] is given by

[formula]

where [formula] [formula] [formula] [formula] and [formula]. Notice that R(u,v)  ≤  ||u||α + 1p*||v||β + 1q*  <    +    ∞  .

Consider the Nehari manifold associated to Problem ([\ref=syst]) given by

[formula]

where D1Iλ,μ and D2Iλ,μ are the derivative of Iλ,μ with respect to the first variable and the second variable respectively.

An interesting and useful characterization of [formula] is the following

[formula]

where

[formula]

and Iλ,μ is considered as a functional of four variables (s,u,t,v) in [formula].

Let λ and μ be two real parameters. A sequence (un,vn)∈W is a Palais-Smale sequence of the functional Iλ,μ if

[formula]

where DIλ,μ(un,vn) denotes the Gâteaux derivative of Iλ,μ.

The last condition ([\ref=diff]) implies that

[formula]

where D1Iλ,μ(un,vn) (resp. D2Iλ,μ(un,vn)) denotes the Gâteaux derivative of Iλ,μ with respect to its first (resp. second) variable.

We introduce the critical level corresponding to Problem ([\ref=syst]) by

[formula]

Then we have the following

Let λ and μ be two real parameters and (un,vn) be a Palais-Smale sequence of Iλ,μ such that

[formula]

Then (un,vn) relatively compact.

Proof. Let λ and μ be two real parameters and (un,vn) be a Palais-Smale sequence of Iλ,μ satisfying the condition ([\ref=elhamidi_sys]). We claim that (un,vn) is bounded in W. Indeed, on one hand conditions ([\ref=niv_c]), ([\ref=diff1]) and ([\ref=diff2]) can be rewritten as the following

[formula]

Using ([\ref=H2]), one gets

[formula]

Suppose that there is a subsequence, still denoted by (un,vn) in W which is unbounded, i.e. [formula] tends to +    ∞   as n goes to +    ∞  . If

[formula]

then using ([\ref=croissancef]) one has

[formula]

since ([\ref=croissancef]) implies that for every ε > 0, there exists c1(ε) > 0 such that

[formula]

Similarly, if

[formula]

then using ([\ref=croissanceg]) it follows

[formula]

On one hand, suppose that

[formula]

Substituting ([\ref=Ruv]) in ([\ref=niv]), we obtain

[formula]

which can not hold true. On the other hand, suppose that

[formula]

then ([\ref=der1]) implies that R(un,vn) is unbounded while ([\ref=der2]) implies, on the contrary, that R(un,vn) is bounded. The case

[formula]

leads to a contradiction with the same argument, which achieves the claim. At this stage, we can assume, up to a subsequence, that

[formula]

It is clear that

[formula]

Let us set

[formula]

Using again the growth conditions ([\ref=croissancef]) and ([\ref=croissanceg]), we show easily that the functions, which are defined on [formula]: (x,s)  ↦  sf(x,s), (x,s)  ↦  sg(x,s), (x,s)  ↦  F(x,s) and (x,s)  ↦  G(x,s) satisfy the conditions of the Brézis-Lieb lemma [\cite=BL]. Then, we have the decompositions

[formula]

Moreover, let ε  >  0, then there is c1(ε)  >  0 such that

[formula]

Let C be a positive constant such that ||Xn||p*p*  ≤  C. Since Xn converges to 0 in L1(Ω), there exists [formula] verifying ||Xn||1  ≤  ε  /  c1, for every n  ≥  n0(ε), thus

[formula]

In the same manner, writing [formula] and using the same arguments as above, we get

[formula]

Similarly, it follows that

[formula]

Applying a slightly modified version of the Brézis-Lieb lemma [\cite=MS], one has

[formula]

It follows that

[formula]

Notice that the Nehari manifold associated to I0,0 is given by

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

Let [formula] be the common limit of P(Xn), Q(Yn) and R(Xn,Yn). We claim that [formula]. By contradiction, suppose that [formula], then on one hand we get

[formula]

where

[formula]

A direct computation shows that

[formula]

therefore

[formula]

On the other hand,

[formula]

Hence, we obtain

[formula]

and consequently

[formula]

This leads to a contradiction with ([\ref=elhamidi_sys]), then [formula], which achieves the proof. [formula]

1) In the scalar case, we obtain the analogous of Theorem [\ref=th1], the proof follows easily with the same arguments. We note here that if we consider the special case ([\ref=bn_eq]), direct computations show that

[formula]

which recovers the famous Brézis-Nirenberg condition ([\ref=seuil]). 2) It is clear that our condition ([\ref=elhamidi]) or ([\ref=elhamidi_sys]) can be extended to a large class of quasilinear or semilinear differential operators: Leray-Lions type operators, fourth-order operators. 3) Using the Hölder inequality in the denominator R(u,v), we get

[formula]

where Sp (resp. Sq) denotes the best Sobolev constant in the embedding W1,pΓ1(Ω)  ⊂  Lp*(Ω) (resp. W1,qΓ2(Ω)  ⊂  Lq*(Ω)).

We end this note by the following interesting relation arising in the special case p = q and Γ1  =  Γ2.

Assume that p = q > 1. Then,

[formula]

Proof. In the special case p = q, direct computations give

[formula]

Then, using ([\ref=important]), we conclude that

[formula]

On the other hand, let (un)  ⊂  W1,pΓ1(Ω) be a minimizing sequence of Sp. Then using the identity ([\ref=K]), we get

[formula]

It is clear that the last quantity goes to [formula] as n  +    ∞  , which achieves the proof. [formula]

For the sharpness of the critical level ([\ref=elhamidi_sys]), we define the sequence ψn(x): = φ(x)Φ1 / n(x) as in ([\ref=sharpness]). We consider then a Palais-Smale sequence (un,vn) for Jλ,μ of level [formula]. Following the same argumets developed in the scalar case and using Proposition [\ref=propos], we prove that the sequence (un  +  ψn,vn  +  ψn) is a Palais-Smale sequence for Jλ,μ of level c*(λ,μ) and which can not be relatively compact in W. This implies the sharpness of the critical level formula ([\ref=elhamidi_sys]).
