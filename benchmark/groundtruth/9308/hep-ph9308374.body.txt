We consider a simple model for the strangeness radius of the nucleon. The model is based on vector meson dominance (VMD) and ω  -  φ mixing in addition to a kaon cloud contribution. We find that the VMD contribution is similar in magnitude and of the same sign as the kaon contribution to the Sachs strangeness radius and is significantly larger than the kaon contribution to the Dirac radius.

In a recent calculation by Musolf and Burkardt [\cite=mu], the nucleon's mean square strangeness radius was evaluated in a simple picture: the entire contribution to the matrix elements [formula] was attributed to the kaon cloud of the nucleon and estimated in a one-loop calculation. This calculation was intended to complement Jaffe's model [\cite=ja], where the strangeness radius (and magnetic moment) is obtained by using a 3-pole fit for the spectral function of the isoscalar form factors of the nucleon, in which one of the poles is assumed to be the physical φ meson. We will refer to Jaffe's approach as the "pole picture".

The results of these two pictures differ significantly. First of all, loop and pole predictions for the strangeness radius have opposite sign (the sign of the loop calculation agrees with the Skyrme model estimates [\cite=ps]). Furthermore, the magnitude of the loop prediction for the strangeness radius is about 5 times smaller than the pole result for the Sachs [\cite=sachs] form and about 20 times smaller for the Dirac radius.

In order to set scales we note that the Sachs charge radius of the neutron is [formula] [\cite=hohler] and that the pole calculation gives a Sachs strangeness radius of the same order of magnitude : [formula]. The Dirac charge radius of the neutron, on the other hand, is [formula], to be compared with [formula] obtained in the pole calculation.

What conclusions can be inferred from this disagreement between the two calculations? If the pole result is correct, then the nucleon has a surprisingly large strangeness radius, meaning that the contribution of strange quarks to the structure of the nucleon is rather important. The nucleon is the lightest state with nonzero baryon number. Why should it choose a quark configuration for which [formula] is so large? On the other hand, if the loop result is correct, one might argue that the strange quark contribution to the nucleon structure is generally small, as one would naively expect from the OZI rule. However, there are experimental indication for non-negligible contributions from the strange quark sector to other properties of the nucleon as, for instance, the scalar strange quark density [\cite=gasser], the strange quark axial-vector form factor seen in the elastic νp / νp cross section [\cite=ahrens], and the strange quark contribution to the proton spin, measured by the EMC [\cite=ashman].

In the light of these questions, it seems quite probable to us that the truth lies somewhere between the results of the two calculations. It is clear that the physical pictures underlying the models in refs. [\cite=mu] and [\cite=ja] are quite different. It is not immediately clear how to combine the "pole-ish" physics of ref. [\cite=ja] with the "loopy" physics at ref.  [\cite=mu]. In particular, it seems likely that one can not simply add the two results on the grounds that this will lead to some double counting. It is the purpose of the present note to establish a link between the pole and loop pictures, by combining the vector meson dominance (VMD) model [\cite=sa] in the ω and φ sector (Y = T = 0, JPC = 1-  -) with the loop calculation. The model we propose dynamically incorporates both the physics of the vector mesons and kaons, and thus avoids double counting. In contrast to the approach of ref. [\cite=ja], it models the φ-nucleon coupling explicitly, in the VMD framework.

Were the ω and φ vector mesons pure [formula] and [formula] states respectively, then the strange current, [formula] could interact with the nucleon only through the φ meson. In this case, in the VMD picture, we could write for the strangeness form factor

[formula]

where Fsi(q2) is the intrinsic strangeness form factor of the nucleon which one might associate with the kaon loop calculation. Note that eq. ([\ref=1]) is independent of both the φ  -  γ and φ-nucleon couplings. As usual in VMD models, they cancel as a consequence of charge normalization [\cite=sa]. From eq. ([\ref=1]) it is clear that the strangeness radius would be given by

[formula]

Since Fsi(0) = 0, the result is exactly the same as in the loop calculation of ref. [\cite=mu]. However, in nature ω and φ are not pure [formula] and [formula] -- they mix. The physical ω and φ vector mesons are linear combinations of pure [formula]   (φ0) and [formula]   (ω0) states, as in ref. [\cite=jain] :

[formula]

therefore, the ω meson can contribute to the strangeness radius.

The mixing angle, ε, is known to be small and we will use the value of ref. [\cite=jain] : ε = 0.053, which is deduced from the decay of the φ meson into π  +  γ and is consistent with its decay into π+  +  π-  +  π0. Our results are clearly sensitive to the value of the mixing angle.

Let us now generalize the VMD ideas to take the φ  -  ω mixing into account. Consider the currents

[formula]

In the VMD picture, one can express the form factors as the product of a vector meson propagator (appropriately normalized) and an intrinsic form factor, describing the vector meson coupling to the nucleon:

[formula]

where n stands for Dirac (n = 1) and Pauli (n = 2) form factors and V(q2,ε) is a matrix that gives the contribution of both ω and φ mesons to the considered currents. For a vanishing mixing angle, ε, we have

[formula]

and eq. ([\ref=1]) is recovered.

For ε  ≠  0 the above matrix eq. ([\ref=form0]) will be rotated from its diagonal form,

[formula]

where the matrix Ĉ gives the coupling of the mesons in eq. ([\ref=states]) with the currents in eq. ([\ref=cur]).

Following Jaffe's prescription for the vector-meson current couplings [\cite=ja], each quark qk couples to the current [formula] with the same strength K and does not couple at all to currents of different flavor. As a result we can write

[formula]

and therefore

[formula]

Of course [formula], as is required to fix the normalization of the charges. Using eq. ([\ref=vd]) together with eq. ([\ref=form]) we can finally write

[formula]

[formula]

where Fo1i(0) = 3 / 2 [\cite=ja].

The net effect of including the physics of VMD on both, the Dirac and Sachs square radius, is to add a contribution [formula] to the intrinsic result. This contribution is independent of the dynamics chosen for the intrinsic physics. It is almost three times bigger than the result in ref. [\cite=mu] for the Dirac strangeness radius, and approximately eight times smaller than the result in ref. [\cite=ja], but with a different sign.

For the intrinsic form factor we will take a kaon loop calculation along the lines of ref. [\cite=mu] as a reasonable but crude model for the intrinsic physics. Our calculation basically reproduces that of ref. [\cite=mu]; the only difference is that the calculations in ref. [\cite=mu] were done with MΛ taken to be degenerate with MN and we use the correct MΛ  -  MN splitting, which tends to decrease the intrinsic strangeness radius.

The pseudoscalar meson-baryon coupling for extended hadrons is schematically given by

[formula]

where Ψ and φ are baryon and meson fields respectively, H(k2) is the form factor at the meson-baryon vertices and k is the momentum of the meson.

The amplitude for the process in which the photon couples to the baryon is

[formula]

where Δ(k2)  =  (k2 - m2K + iε)- 1 is the kaon propagator, [formula] is the Λ propagator, [formula] with q being the photon momentum, and QΛ is the Λ strangeness charge. In a convention where the s-quark has strangeness + 1 we get QΛ = 1.

The amplitude for the process in which the photon couples to the meson is

[formula]

where QK =  - 1 is the kaon strangeness charge.

The effective baryon-meson interaction is nonlocal for extended baryons and this induces an electromagnetic vertex current if the photon field is present. The gauge invariance of this effective interaction can be maintained via minimal substitution, which generates the seagull vertex [\cite=ohta]:

[formula]

where the upper and lower signs correspond to an incoming or outgoing meson respectively.

The amplitude for the process in which the photon couples to the vertices is

[formula]

With these three amplitudes it is easy to check the Ward-Takahashi identity

[formula]

where Q is the nucleon strangeness Q = QΛ  +  QK  =  0, and Σ(p) is the self-energy of the nucleon related to the KΛ loop. The sum of the three amplitudes also guaranties the charge non-renormalization (or the Ward Identity)

[formula]

We finally express these amplitudes in terms of the Dirac and Pauli nucleon intrinsic form factors

[formula]

The numerical results for < r2is  >  Dirac and Fs2i(o) = μsi ( the intrinsic strangeness magnetic moment) are shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 respectively, as a function of the form factor cut-off Λ. The value of the coupling and masses used are [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula] [\cite=holz]. For the form factor at the meson-nucleon vertices we use

[formula]

as in the Bonn potential for baryon-baryon interactions [\cite=holz]. The same form was used in ref. [\cite=mu]. The Bonn value for the cut-off Λ in the NΛK vertex is in the range 1.2 -- 1.4 [formula]. We also plot in Figs. 1 and 2, for comparison, the results of ref. [\cite=mu] where MN instead of MΛ was used in the baryon propagators (in eqs. ([\ref=bv]), ([\ref=mv]) and ([\ref=vv])).

In table I, we compare the results for the nucleon mean-square strangeness radius obtained in this work with the pure loop calculation of ref. [\cite=mu] (using MΛ in the baryon intermediate state) and with ref. [\cite=ja]. The first two results correspond to the upper and lower Bonn fit values of the cut-off Λ [\cite=holz]. As in ref. [\cite=mu] the signs of our results are opposite to the pure pole predictions. From this table we conclude that the vector meson contribution to the Dirac strangeness radius of the nucleon, in a world where the real ω and φ mesons are given by eq. ([\ref=states]), is far more important than the intrinsic contribution, even for a mixing angle as small as ε  =  0.053. This is encouraging since, as pointed out in ref. [\cite=mu], the intrinsic contribution to < r2is  >  Dirac from the seagull vertex dominates the remaining intrinsic contributions by more than an order of magnitude. As the prescription to determine the seagull vertex is not unique, it is reassuring that our result, in contrast to ref. [\cite=mu], depends on it only weakly. we find a Dirac strangeness radius almost four times bigger than the pure kaon-loop calculation and around six times smaller than Jaffe's pole result. For the Sachs mean-square strangeness radius we get almost twice the size of the kaon-loop calculation and around 1/3 of the pole result.

We expect that the experiments planned at CEBAF [\cite=cebaf] with the objective of constraining the nucleon's mean-square strangeness radius will soon give some empirical basis for deciding which picture is more appropriate to describe the nucleon's vector current strangeness matrix element.

In conclusion, we evaluated the vector current strangeness matrix element of the nucleon at low momentum transfer, based on the simple physical picture of a kaon cloud, coupled to ω and φ mesons via vector meson dominance. ω and φ are mixed states of pure [formula] and [formula]. The numbers obtained in this picture for the nucleon strangeness radius lie between the results of refs.  [\cite=mu] (pure kaon cloud) and [\cite=ja] (pure vector meson poles), and are both, Dirac and Sachs, of observable magnitude. In contrast to ref. [\cite=ja], in our model a decreasing mixing angle decreases the strange quark matrix elements of the nucleon. Unlike in ref. [\cite=mu], the relative importance of the ambiguous seagull contribution to the result is controllable (less than 30%).
