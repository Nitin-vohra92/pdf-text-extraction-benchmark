There has been much interest recently in associated production of a J / ψ and a photon (γ) in collider [\cite=drekim] and fixed-target experiments [\cite=ours] [\cite=mine]. In the framework of the colour-singlet model [\cite=berjon] [\cite=baier], the QCD subprocess that contributes to the production of a J / ψ and a photon is:

[formula]

The above subprocess is related to that for photoproduction of J / ψ by crossing. The photoproduction process and the process in Eq. ([\ref=e1]) are gluon-initiated, and have been suggested as sensitive probes of gluon densities in lepton-nucleon experiments [\cite=berjon], and in hadron-nucleon experiments [\cite=drekim] [\cite=ours], respectively.

The J / ψ  +  γ mode is also the decay mode in which the P-state charmonia are detected [\cite=isr] [\cite=e705]. In this letter, we emphasise that, at low values of the invariant mass of the J / ψ  +  γ pair, the process in Eq. ([\ref=e1]) forms an important (and computable) part of the background to the decay of P-state charmonia into J / ψ and γ. We present in the following the invariant-mass distributions for the process in Eq. ([\ref=e1]). In the mass region of the χ's, this process is a background to the χ decay signal. At larger masses the J / ψ  +  γ continuum is dominated by the QCD subprocess and could serve as an interesting test of QCD.

The differential cross-section for the process g + g  →  J / ψ  +  γ is

[formula]

where Minv is the invariant mass of the J / ψ-γ pair, [formula] ([formula] being the centre-of-mass energy), and G(x1,2) is the gluon distribution in the beam and the target, respectively. The subprocess cross-section is [\cite=berjon]

[formula]

The modulus squared, |R(0)|2, of the wave-function at the origin is related to the leptonic decay width by

[formula]

and F in Eq. ([\ref=e2]), is given by

[formula]

In the above equation, y1 is the rapidity of the J / ψ, τ  =  M2J / s, and [formula]. The rapidity of the J / ψ is expressed in terms of the variables x1, Minv and xT by the following kinematic relation :

[formula]

with

[formula]

Using the cross-section in Eq. ([\ref=e2]), we obtain the invariant-mass distributions by integrating over x1 and xT, with the ranges of integration chosen to be

[formula]

Note that the xT integration is not bounded from below, and we are integrating over regions of phase space where the photon could become soft. The subprocess cross-section in Eq. ([\ref=e3]) is finite in the soft-photon limit. Nevertheless, for perturbation theory to provide a reliable answer, internal lines in the Feynman graphs of [\cite=berjon] must remain sufficiently off-shell. This requirement means that the kinematic region should be chosen such that the photon does not become soft. This condition can be ensured if we choose Minv such that

[formula]

where Δ is larger than some value, e.g. 1 GeV[formula]. If Minv  ≥   3.25 GeV, then the cross-section given in Eq. ([\ref=e3]) can be considered a reasonable lowest-order estimate of J / ψ  +  γ production. Contributions from soft-gluon radiation [\cite=catani] will tend to increase the cross-section, and so our estimate can be regarded as a lower bound on the cross section arising from the gluon-gluon fusion subprocess. A more reliable estimate of the cross-section could be obtained after the soft-gluon corrections to this process are computed. We plan to undertake a study of these corrections in the future.

Integrating x1 and xT over the ranges specified above, we obtain the invariant-mass distributions for Minv  ≥  3.15 GeV. We present results for pN and πN collisions, for typical values of [formula]. For the proton structure functions, we use the MRS-S0 distributions [\cite=mrs] and for the pion distributions, the GRV-P distributions [\cite=grv]. The parton distributions are evolved to the scale Q2 = M2J + p2T. In Fig. 1 we show the invariant-mass distribution M3invdσ / dMinv as a function of [formula], for pN collisions. The two curves correspond to beam energies of 300 GeV and 600 GeV, respectively. We see that approximate scaling sets in, in the region beyond [formula].

In Fig. 2 we plot the number of events/GeV for pN collisions and compare with data from an ISR experiment [\cite=isr] and the E705 Fermilab experiment [\cite=e705], ([formula] 62 GeV and 23.72 GeV, respectively). For the ISR data we display the distribution as a function of Minv, whereas for the E705 data we use ΔM  =  Minv  -  MJ. In comparing the shapes of our curves with the data, we normalise to the experimental points at Minv  =   4.8 GeV and ΔM = 0.88 GeV, respectively. The shape of the distributions away from the resonance region may be in reasonable agreement with the data, but it is desirable to have data that extend to larger values of Minv. This experimental information will be valuable since it will serve as a test of the QCD predictions of both the magnitude and the Minv dependence. We suggest that data on associated production of J / ψ  +  γ at large invariant masses could provide a QCD test of gluon initiated hard-scattering reactions similar in quality to the QCD test that massive lepton-pair production provides for quark-antiquark initiated hard-scattering.

With the normalisation fixed as stated in the paragraph above, we find that the QCD process could account for about 25% of the events under the resonance, for both sets of data. In [\cite=isr] [\cite=e705] the background to χ decay is constructed from uncorrelated J / ψ and γ momentum vectors obtained from different events and normalized to the data above the χ mass region. Thus, in the analyses of [\cite=isr] [\cite=e705], the QCD signal that we are discussing seems to have been subsumed into the "background".

In Fig. 3 we show the invariant-mass distributions for both pN and πN collisions at [formula] 23.72 GeV. A lower cut on the photon energy is often employed in the data because definition of the photon may be poor at low photon energies. We present results for three different cuts on the laboratory energy of the photon ([formula] 0, 1.0, 2.5 GeV). The mass distribution is not very sensitive to the photon energy cut, although the peak is shifted slightly to larger Minv as the photon energy cut is raised.

In addition to the mass distribution discussed above, we have analysed the angular distributions of the J / ψ in the J / ψ-γ rest-frame (which corresponds, in lowest order perturbation theory, to the subprocess centre-of-mass frame). The angular distribution is expressed as

[formula]

with pT given in terms of the polar angle θ* of the J / ψ as

[formula]

After integrating over x1, we obtain dσ / dθ*dMinv. In Fig. 4 we show the angular distribution as a function of θ* for different values of Minv, for pp collisions at [formula] GeV. The distribution is symmetric about θ*  =  0, and the dependence on θ* becomes stonger with increasing Minv.

Experimental information on angular distributions in the J / ψ-γ rest system should be useful in establishing the production mechanism. In the decay of χ2's to J / ψ  +  γ, the J / ψ angular distribution is expected to follow [\cite=ioffe] a (1 + 2θ*) behaviour. In the same mass region (Minv = 3.5 GeV), the QCD angular distribution that we have computed obeys a (1 + α2θ*) fit, with α = 0.48. Selections on θ* should help to enhance the resonance signal relative to the QCD process and vice-versa. For larger Minv, the QCD angular distribution shows a large contribution from an additional 4θ* term. In the χ resonance region, the resonance and part of the QCD background occur in the same partial wave. A complete analysis of this mass region would require a proper treatment of the effects of final-state interactions.[\cite=basber]

In summary, we have presented calculations of invariant-mass distributions for associated production of J / ψ  +  γ through gluon-gluon fusion. This QCD process provides a potentially important background to the J / ψ  +  γ decay mode of the P-state charmonia. Angular distributions may be useful for separating the QCD contribution from the charmonium resonance signal. At large invariant masses, associated production of J / ψ  +  γ should serve as a good test of hard-scattering initiated by gluons.
