STRINGS, BRANES and TWO-TIME PHYSICS I. Bars, C. Deliduman and D. Minic Department of Physics and Astronomy University of Southern California Los Angeles, CA 90089-0484 Abstract

We generalize the ideas and formalism of Two-Time Physics from particle dynamics to some specific examples of string and p-brane (p  ≥  1) dynamics. The two-time string or p-brane action can be gauge fixed to produce various one-time string or p-brane actions that are dual to each other under gauge transformations. We discuss the particular gauges that correspond to tensionless strings and p-branes in flat (d-1)+1 spacetime, rigid strings and p-branes in flat (d-1)+1 spacetime, and tensionless strings and p-branes propagating in the AdSd - n  ×   Sn backgrounds.

Introduction

There exist by now many convincing examples of a remarkable connection between a global SO(d,2) symmetry (sometimes hidden and non-lineraly realized) in one-time point particle dynamics and the two-time Lorentz SO[formula] symmetry that is linearly realized in a two-time action with extra gauge symmetries [\cite=bda]-[\cite=bdm1]. The basic property is that the gauge symmetry reduces the two-time action to a one-time action, but in many possible gauge equivalent ways, thus establishing a "duality" between various one-time dynamical systems and unifying them in some sense. The motivation for this approach - called Two-Time Physics - comes from the algebraic approach to M-theory and its extensions [\cite=bars1] [\cite=mth] [\cite=fth] [\cite=bk] [\cite=bd2] that provide various hints of hidden two timelike dimensions. There also exist indications that the formalism of Two-Time Physics is applicable to the full structure of M-theory [\cite=bdm2].

The crucial observation of [\cite=bda]-[\cite=bdm1] is that many point particle systems (relativistic massless and massive particle, non-relativistic massless and massive particle, H-atom, harmonic oscillator, particle moving in the AdS background, etc.) in (d-1)-space and 1-time dimensions can be understood as different gauge choices of a 2-time point particle system endowed with a local Sp(2,R) symmetry and manifestly invariant under the global SO(d,2) symmetry. Unlike Yang-Mills type gauge theories, the concept of "time" is gauge dependent in the Two-Time-Physics formalism (see also General Relativity although it has only one gauge dependent timelike dimension). Therefore the gauge fixed Lagrangian or Hamiltonian (spectrum) describes diverse systems that would appear unrelated in ordinary 1-time dynamics. However, there are gauge invariant quantities that can be computed in any one of these systems with identical results (for example Casimir eigenvalues of the SO[formula] representation). Thus such systems display properties of their unification under a common gauge invariant action.

The particular Sp(2,R) symmetry that is gauged in this case is nothing but the familiar authomorphism of the Heisenberg commutation relations in quantum mechanics, or the symplectic group of the one-particle phase space of classical Hamiltonian dynamics. One can also think of the same Sp(2,R)  ~  SO(1,2) as the conformal group in one (world-line) dimension. From this point of view many 0 + 1 quantum gravity systems (relativistic massless and massive particle, non-relativistic massless and massive particle, etc.) can be viewed as different gauge choices of the same 0 + 1 conformal quantum gravity theory [\cite=bda].

In some specific instances (like the relativistic massless particle) the action of the global SO(d,2) can be interpreted as the natural action of the conformal group in d-dimensions. What is surprising is that the same group has a natural action, even though with a highly non-linear realization, in many other physical situations (the relativistic massive particle, for example) [\cite=b1]. The Hamiltonians describing these two different physical systems (relativistic massless and massive particle) are related by a canonical Sp(2,R) transformation, which is responsible for the appearance of the global SO(d,2) invariance of the action describing the relativistic massive particle. The evolution parameters ("times") in the two cases, being canonically conjugate to the respective Hamiltonians, are different as well.

One can also interpret the same SO(d,2) as the Lorentz group in the space with one extra spatial and one extra time dimensions. The parameters in the various Hamiltonians related by the local Sp(2,R) transformations, appear as moduli (values of fields) in this (d,2) dimensional space (e.g. mass of particle, coupling of H-atom, etc.). Note that the Two-Time Physics formalism works both classically and quantum-mechanically [\cite=bda]-[\cite=bdm1]. It turns out that in the full quantum theory, the Sp(2,R) gauge invariant sector is completely described by a unique representation of the conformal group SO(d,2), which fixes the values of the SO(d,2) Casimirs.

The same formalism can be generalized to the case of particles with spin n / 2 by using world-line supersymmetry with n supercharges (by replacing Sp(2,R) with OSp(n|2)) [\cite=bd1] and to target-space supersymmetry (by generalizing the action of the global SO(d,2) symmetry to various superconformal groups) [\cite=bdm1]. In the latter case, the formalism of Two-Time Physics sheds new light on the origin of fermionic kappa supersymmetry. This provides an explicit way for constructing physical models invariant under global superconformal symmetry groups OSp[formula], SU[formula], OSp[formula] which have usual space-time interpretations in d = 3,4,6 [\cite=bdm1] and an expanded space-time interpretation including zero modes of p-brane gauge potentials in other dimensions [\cite=bdm2]. The same approach explicitly establishes the existence of the novel bosonic counterparts of kappa supersymmetry [\cite=bdm2].

In this letter we want to extend the formalism of Two-Time Physics for the case of strings and p-branes (p  ≥  2). We find a natural action of the global SO(d,2) conformal symmetry in the case of many classical systems involving bosonic strings and branes in [formula] dimensions. The list includes the bosonic null string and branes, the null string moving in the AdS background and the bosonic rigid string and branes. The actions for these systems admit the extension to the two-time formalism by the addition of gauge degrees of freedom. The new gauge invariant actions can be gauge fixed to many other dual sytems of branes in the same manner of particle dynamics.

The letter is organized as follows. In section 2 we briefly review the Two-time Physics formalism for the case of particle dynamics. Then in section 3 we extend this formalism and discuss tensionless strings and branes by working with configuration space variables only. We apply this approach in section 4 for the case of tensionless strings and branes moving in the AdS background. In section 5 we discuss the rigid bosonic strings and branes. Finally, we comment on possible generalizations of the results presented in this letter.

Basic Formalism of Two-Time Physics

We start with a brief summary of the Two-Time Physics formalism for the case of spinless particle dynamics [\cite=bda]. The model is an Sp(2,R) gauge theory described by the action (the various forms of the action and their utility will be explained below)

[formula]

Here XMi(τ) is an Sp(2,R) doublet, consisting of the ordinary coordinate and its conjugate momentum ([formula] and [formula]). The indices i,j = 1,2 denote the doublet Sp(2,R), they are raised and lowered by the antisymmetric Levi-Civita symbol εij. The covariant derivative Dτ is defined as

[formula]

The local Sp(2,R) acts as δXMi  =  εikωklXml and δAij  =  ωikεklAkj  +  ωjkεklAik, where [formula] is a symmetric matrix containting three gauge parameters. The second form of the action is obtained after an integration by parts so that only XM1 appears with derivatives. This allows the identification of X,P by the canonical procedure, as indicated in the third form of the action.

The gauge fields [formula], [formula], and [formula] also act as Langrange multipliers for the following three first class constraints (that form the Sp[formula] algebra)

[formula]

as implied by the local Sp(2,R) invariance. It is precisely the solution of these constraints that require that the global metric ηMN has a signature with two-time like dimensions. Thus, ηMN stands for the flat metric on a (d,2) dimensional space-time, which is the only signature consistent with the equations of motion for the Sp(2,R) gauge field Akl, leading to a non-trivial dynamics that can be consistently quantized. Hence the global two-time SO(d,2) is implied by the local Sp(2,R) symmetry. It is possible to extend ηMN to curved spacetime [formula] with suitable modification of the transformation laws and certain conditions on the metric. Likewise, it is possible to extend the action to include background gauge fields. Such generalizations will be discussed in [\cite=emgrav].

The fourth form of the action ([\ref=conform]) is obtained by integrating out PM. Note that the ordinary τ reparametrization [formula] corresponds to a U(1) subgroup of Sp(2,R), with the gauge potential A22 = e and gauge parameter [formula]. Recalling that Sp[formula] is the conformal group on the worldline, this form of the action can be viewed as a generalization of 0 + 1 gravity (τ-reparametrization) to 0 + 1 conformal gravity. The gauge potentials e,A,k and parameters ω22,ω12,ω11 are associated with the SO[formula] generators for local translations, dilatations and conformal transformations respectively.

The fifth form of the action ([\ref=confor]) is obtained after integtating by parts the cross term [formula] and defining [formula] as the total coefficient of X2 / 2. This form of the action is still invariant under the same Sp[formula] local symmetries. The simplest form of the symmetries are the τ reparametrization [formula] and the local scaling [formula]

[formula]

while XM,e and K are all invariant under the local conformal transformations ω11. This is the simplest form of the action, and it is this form that we will explore below in discussing strings and p-branes.

All forms of the action ([\ref=action]-[\ref=confor]) have an explicit global SO(d,2) invariance, generated by the Lorentz generators LMN = XMPN - XNPM  =  εijXMiXNj that are gauge invariant. As we mentioned above, different gauge choices lead to different 0 + 1 theories of 0 + 1 gravity (the relativistic massless and massive particles, H-atom, harmonic oscillator, etc.) all of which have SO(d,2) invariant actions that are directly obtained from ([\ref=action]-[\ref=confor]) by gauge fixing. Since the action ([\ref=action]-[\ref=confor]) and the generators LMN are gauge invariant, the global symmetry SO[formula] is not lost by gauge fixing. This explains why one should expect a hidden (previously unnoticed) global symmetry SO[formula] for each of the 0 + 1 systems that result by gauge fixing. Note that the equations of motion, not only the action, of the manifestly SO(d,2) invariant particle system reduce to the expected equations of motion of the (d - 1,1) gauge fixed systems, indicating the validity of the gauge-fixing procedure.

If the system is quantized in a fixed gauge the absence of ghosts is evident. The system can also be quantized covariantly; then the Sp(2,R) gauge symmetry is just enough to remove all negative-norm states ("ghosts") introduced by two timelike dimensions so that the resulting quantum theory is unitary. In the quantum version of the theory the unifying feature of the system is displayed by the fact that all the gauge fixed systems, or the covariantly quantized system, share the same unitary representation of SO[formula]. For example the quadratic Casimir eigenvalue is [formula] for the free massless particle, the H-atom, harmonic oscillator (in one less dimension), the particle moving on AdSd - n  ×  Sn (any n), etc., and similarly for all Casimir eigenvalues [formula].

As mentioned before this action has been generalized to particles with spin n / 2 (via local OSp[formula] [\cite=bd1]), to spacetime supersymmetry [\cite=bdm1] [\cite=bdm2] and to interactions with background fields [\cite=emgrav].

Extensions to Tensionless Strings and Branes

In this section we want to extend the formalism of Two-Time Physics reviewed in the previous section for the case of tensionless strings and branes. We do not start from a general formalism as in the case of particle mechanics (the general formalism which is still being developed will be given elsewhere). Rather, we discuss specific cases, which point toward a more general formulation. We will work with configuration space variables as in the the last form of the action ([\ref=confor]).

We begin with a string analog of the massless relativistic particle. We rotate the extra space [formula] and time [formula] dimension into a pair of "light-cone-like" coordinates [formula] and [formula].We recall that [\cite=bda]-[\cite=bdm1] in this basis [formula], fixing two gauges [formula], [formula], and solving two constraints X2 = X  ·  P = 0, gives [formula] after identifying Xμ = xμ. Then the action ([\ref=action][\ref=confor]) reduces to the action for a massless particle in d-dimensions [formula]. This action has a well known global non-linearly realized conformal symmetry SO[formula] which is a reflection of the SO[formula] two-time Lorentz symmetry of the original gauge invariant action as as explained in the previous section. This action implies the familiar equations of motion [formula] and [formula]. The stringy counterpart of the massless particle is the null string [\cite=null] in d-space-time dimensions

[formula]

where we used the Poisson bracket {xμ,xν}  =  εab∂axμ∂bxν with a or b = 0,1 denoting the world-sheet indices for τ and σ. The equations of motion for [formula] and [formula] are respectively

[formula]

The last equation says that the determinant g =  det gab of the induced metric gab  =  ∂ax  ·  ∂bx is zero, i.e. [formula]. The fact that the metric is degenerate implies that the world-sheet of the string is a null surface. Also, the tension of the null string is zero. We note that a solution of the equations of motion is given by strings that can be excited purely for left or purely right movers (keep either +   or -   ) with the following constraints

[formula]

Just like the massless particle action, the null string action is invariant under the global d-dimensional conformal group SO(d,2) for which

[formula]

where λ,aμ,bμ,ωμν are the infinitesimal global parameters for dilatations, translations, conformal transformations and Lorentz transformations in Minkowski spacetime. We can reinterpret this SO(d,2) conformal symmetry as the two-time Lorentz symmetry if we start from an action that is manifestly SO(d,2) invariant in d + 2 dimensions, but has extra local symmetries, so that the gauge fixed version of such an action reduces to a d-space-time dimensional action for the null string ([\ref=nulls]). Thus consider the following manifestly SO(d,2) invariant action as a generalization of the particle action ([\ref=confor])

[formula]

In addition to τ,σ reparametrization invariance with parameter [formula]

[formula]

the action is also invariant under the local scale transformations with parameter α(τ,σ)

[formula]

These generalize the symmetries ([\ref=dtau], [\ref=dalpha]) from particles to strings.

Using the local scale invariance we can choose again the gauge [formula] Then the equation of motion for the gauge potential K (which also acts as a lagrange multiplier for the condition X2 = 0) can be solved for [formula]. Plugging back this particular gauge choice into the SO(d,2) invariant action ([\ref=str1]), we immediately get the ordinary null string action in d-space-time dimensions ([\ref=nulls]).

One can also examine the equations of motion for the components [formula], [formula] and Xμ to see that they indeed reduce to the equations of motions of the d-space-time dimensional null string. Thus, the d-space-time dimensional action ([\ref=nulls]) is a genuine gauge fixed version of the manifestly SO(d,2) invariant action ([\ref=str1])!

The generators of the Lorenz transformations in the (d,2)- dimensional space as derived from the action ([\ref=str1]) are [formula] - XNPM0), where now PM0,1  =  ∂0,1XM. It is a simple matter to check that by using the gauge [formula], this reduces to the ordinary generators of the d-dimensional conformal group ([\ref=confgr]) as they would be derived from the action ([\ref=nulls]).

We can immediately extend our discussion to the case of null branes. The manifestly SO(d,2) invariant action for a null p-brane (p  ≥  2) is given by

[formula]

where [formula] with the following definition

[formula]

where now ak denote the world-volume indices. As before, by using the local scale invariance, and going to the gauge [formula], one derives the standard d-space-time dimensional action for the null p-brane. The equations of motion of the manifestly SO(d,2) invariant tensionless p-brane reduce in the same gauge to the equations of motion in d-space-time dimensions.

Thus we conclude that the physics of both null strings and branes are invariant under the action of the d-dimensional conformal group SO(d,2) and can be viewed from a (d,2)-dimensional point of view.

We have also gained a new perpective for these systems. The action ([\ref=str1] can now be gauge fixed in many ways as in the particle case [\cite=bda]-[\cite=bdm1]. This produces various field theories in a p + 1 worldvolume with [formula] degrees of freedom. Since these have have a common origin, a duality exists between them, which amounts to gauge transformations involving the local symmetries. We examine one class of such gauges in the next section.

Tensionless p-Branes in AdSd - n  ×  Sn Backgrounds

In this section we briefly discuss a class of gauges for the theory defined by the action ([\ref=str1]) in analogy to the particle case in [\cite=b3]. We work in the d + 2 dimensional coordinate system labelled by [formula] where the [formula] dimensions are divided into two sets: the first labelled by μ  describes [formula] dimensions including one time, and the second labelled by i describes n + 1 spacelike dimensions. We choose the gauge that makes the length of the vector [formula] a constant R independent of [formula], i.e. [formula] and then solve the constraint X2 = 0. The solution is conveniently parametrized by the two vectors [formula] and [formula]

[formula]

The induced metric is

[formula]

where in the last line we have used the definition of the the length of the vector [formula] and the unit vector [formula] in n + 1 dimensions that describes the sphere Sn. The form of the induced metric gab shows that the background metric describes the curved space AdSd - n  ×  Sn given by

[formula]

Therefore this choice of gauge corresponds to a null p-brane propagating in an AdSd - n  ×  Sn background described by the lagrangian density

[formula]

This is of interest in the recent literature on the AdS/CFT duality [\cite=m1] [\cite=w1] [\cite=gkp]. Our form shows that the global symmetry is larger than the Killing symmetries of the background [formula]; the full symmetry is SO[formula] which contains more than the Killing symmetries.

The important point is that both the flat null p-branes of ([\ref=nulls]) and the null AdS×  S p-branes for every n, appear as particular gauge choices of the same manifestly SO(d,2) invariant action! This provides some examples of dual p-brane theories. We expect that the further exploration of other gauges and dualities would be quite interesting.

Higher Order Terms in the Lagrangian: the Rigid String and Branes

We can also discuss the presence of higher order terms in the manifestly SO(d,2) invariant lagrangian we have used in the discussion of the null string. It turns out that the rigid string [\cite=rigid] naturally appears in this formulation.

First we recall that the action for the rigid string in d-space-time dimensions is given by [\cite=rigid]

[formula]

Here the second fundamental form Kiab is defined by the equation

[formula]

where [formula] is the Christoffel symbol for the induced metric gab  =  ∂axμ∂bxμ. Also, the vectors nμi satisfy

[formula]

where i = 1,...,(d - 2). The above action can be rewritten in many ways up to a total derivative [\cite=rigid]. For example

[formula]

where [formula] is the Laplacian defined with respect to the induced metric gab. Another rewriting of the same action, which we find particularly useful for our purposes, is [\cite=rigid]

[formula]

where [formula].

Now we can easily see that ([\ref=rigidd]) is invariant under the action of the d-dimensional conformal group SO(d,2). We can directly prove the invariance under dilatations (as originally observed in [\cite=rigid]) and the special conformal transformations (as recently observed in [\cite=bcfm]) for the case of the action ([\ref=rig]), if we recall the results from section 3.

Consequently, we can extend the action ([\ref=rigidd]) to a space-time with one extra space and one extra time dimension to the manifestly SO(d,2) invariant action

[formula]

with [formula] and gab  =  ∂aXM∂bXN ηMN . In other words, we claim that when ([\ref=R1] is evaluated in the gauge [formula], [formula] and Xμ = xμ it reduces to the d-space-time dimensional action ([\ref=rigidd] The usual conformal transformations are generated again by LMN of section 3. Again LMN are naturally interpreted as Lorentz generators in (d,2) -dimensional space-time.

We can immediately extend this result for the case of rigid branes. The manifestly SO(d,2) invariant action for a rigid p-brane is

[formula]

with

[formula]

Once again, in the gauge [formula], [formula] and Xμ = xμ this action reduces to the d-space-time dimensional action.

Obviously the same observations can be made if we consider a linear combination of the manifestly SO(d,2) invariant classical null string (or brane) and rigid string (or brane) actions in the same gauge.

It is tempting to speculate (as in [\cite=bcfm]) that a supersymmetric version of these tensionless strings is relevant for the understanding of the dynamics of tensionless strings in 6-space-time dimensions. To make this speculation more concrete we need to extend our formalism to target-space supersymmetry, perhaps along the lines of [\cite=bdm1] [\cite=bdm2].

Outlook

In this letter we have made a few preliminary steps towards extending the formalism of Two-Time Physics for the case of string and p-brane (p  ≥  2) dynamics. We have found a natural action of the global SO(d,2) symmetry in the case of several classical systems involving bosonic strings and branes. The list includes the bosonic null string and branes, the null string moving in the AdS×  S background and the bosonic rigid string and branes.

The next natural question is to ask whether we can extend our results to other examples of string and brane dynamics. For example, in the case of particle dynamics it is possible to obtain the massive relativistic particle as a gauge choice [\cite=b3]. Is it analogously possible to relate the dynamics of strings and branes with tension (see footnote 3) to tensionless strings and branes such that they are all derived from the same two-time physics action? One positive indicator in this direction is the observation made in [\cite=town]: the tension of a bosonic string or brane can be generated if a kind of bosonic Wess-Zumino term is added to the action of the tensionless string. This mechanism has a natural supersymmetric extension. It would be interesting to see if this mechanism has a counterpart in the formalism of Two-Time Physics.

As we have pointed out in the introduction and in eqs.([\ref=action]-[\ref=confor] one way to think about the gauging of the canonical Sp(2,R) group in the case of particle dynamics, is to identify Sp(2,R)  ~  SO(1,2) as the conformal group on the world-line (similarly OSp[formula] for conformal supergravity [\cite=bd1]). Then various 0 + 1 (super) quantum gravity systems emerge as gauge fixed versions of the same (super)conformal gravity system with the manifest global SO(d,2) symmetry. What is the analog of this viewpoint in the case of strings and p-branes? It would be natural to extend gravity to conformal gravity on the world-sheet (or world p+1-volume). For strings the world-sheet conformal group is SO(2,2)  ~  SO(1,2)l ×  SO(1,2)r ~  Sp(2,R)l  ×  Sp(2,R)r which is tantalizing. More generally, for a p-brane conformal gravity would correspond to the gauging of SO[formula]. A general formulation of various string and p-brane models along these lines, with the aim of obtaining a general description of Two-Time Physics is currently under study.

Finally, it is of crucial importance to consider the space-time supersymmetric extensions of our results, perhaps by generalizing the novel formalism of [\cite=bdm1] [\cite=bdm2] to strings and branes.
