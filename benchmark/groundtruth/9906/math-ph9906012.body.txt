Introduction

Kählerian manifolds constitute a major class of Riemannian (complex) manifolds and powerful methods of complex differential geometry have been developed to investigate their properties (see e.g. [\cite=Bes]). In this paper we shall consider an apparently new class of pseudo-Riemannian manifolds which will be called anti-Kählerian manifolds and which are also deeply related with complex analysis.

Recall that a Kählerian  manifold can be defined as a triple (M,g,J) which consists of a smooth manifold M endowed with an almost complex structure J and a Riemannian metric g such that [formula], where [formula] is the Levi-Civita connection of g and the metric g is assumed to be Hermitian: g(JX,JY) = g(X,Y) for all vectorfields X and Y on M. By an anti-Kählerian  manifold we mean instead a triple (M,g,J) which consists of a smooth manifold M, an almost complex structure J and a metric g such that [formula], where [formula] is the Levi-Civita connection of g and the metric g is anti-Hermitian: g(JX,JY) =  - g(X,Y) for all vectorfields X and Y on M. An almost-complex anti-Hermitian structure defines in particular an [formula]-structure on M. Structures of this kind have been also studied under the names: almost complex structure with Norden (or B-) metric [\cite=Nor] [\cite=CHR] [\cite=GI] [\cite=BB] [\cite=OP].

In this paper anti-Kählerian  manifolds will be investigated. In particular we will show that any such metric g should be the real part of a certain holomorphic metric on M. Holomorphic Riemannian metrics on "complex space-times" have been discussed in Plebaski [\cite=Ple], Penrose [\cite=Pen]. Let us mention that the characterization of complex analytic Riemannian metrics in terms of complex connections has been considered in Ivanov [\cite=Iva].

We also consider the Chern numbers of anti-Kählerian  manifolds and anti-Kählerian  Einstein manifolds. A family of examples of anti-Kählerian  manifolds will be given. It will be shown that all odd Chern numbers of anti-Kählerian  manifolds vanish and that a compact Kählerian  manifold cannot be anti-Kählerian. It will also be shown that complex parallelisable manifolds (in particular the factor space G / D of a complex Lie group G over the discrete subgroup D ) are anti-Kählerian  manifolds.

Finally, we show that the complexification of a given Einstein metric leads to a method of generating new solutions of Einstein equations from a given one. In particular, it implies that the class of Einstein metrics with neutral signature is the largest one in the following sense: any Einstein metric, (of arbitrary signature) in dimension m, generates (at least locally) an infinite family of Einstein metrics with neutral signatures in dimensions 2km, [formula]  . Anti-Kählerian  manifolds appeared naturally in a previous work of ours in connection with a variational principle in nonlinear theories of gravity [\cite=BFFV2] [\cite=BFFV3].

Holomorphic metrics

Let (M,J) be a 2m-dimensional real almost-complex manifold and let g be an anti-Hermitian metric on M:

[formula]

or equivalently:

[formula]

Then the metric g has necessarily a neutral (Kleinian) signature (m,m). We extend J,g and the Levi-Civita connection of g in the well known way by [formula]-linearity to the complexification of the tangent bundle [formula]. Let us now fix a (real) basis {X1,...,Xm,JX1,...,JXm} in each tangent space TxM; then the set {Za,Zā}, where Za = Xa - iJXa, Zā = Xa + iJXa, forms a basis for each complexified tangent space [formula]. Unless otherwise stated, little Latin indices a,b,c,... run from 1 to m, while Latin capitals A,B,C,... run through [formula]; for notational convenience we shall also bar capital indices and we shall assume [formula]. One has JZa = iZa and JZā  =   - iZā. We set gAB = g(ZA,ZB) = gBA. Then the following holds:

Proposition 2.1.  Let (M,J) be an almost-complex manifold and g be an anti-Hermitian metric on it. Then the complex extended metric g (in the complex basis introduced above) satisfies the following conditions

[formula]

[formula]

Conversely, if the complex extended metric gAB satisfies (1-2) then the initial metric must be anti-Hermitian.

The proof of this result is straightforward.

It will be customary, in this note, to write a metric satisfying (1-2) as

[formula]

since in adapted almost-complex coordinates (see below) [formula], za = xa + iya one has

[formula]

where [formula], [formula] and Re reads Real Part.

We define now the complex Christoffel symbols ΓCAB by

[formula]

It is known [\cite=KN] that if [formula] then the torsion T and the Nijenhuis tensor N satisfy the identity

[formula]

for all vectorfields X and Y. Since the complex extended Levi-Civita connection [formula] has vanishing torsion, the complex Christoffel symbols are symmetric, i.e.: ΓCAB  =  ΓCBA. In this case the complex structure J is integrable, so that the real manifold M inherits the structure of a complex manifold. Let us now recall (see e.g. [\cite=KN]) that there is a one-to-one correspondence between complex manifolds and real manifolds with an integrable complex structure. This means that there exists an atlas of real, adapted (local) coordinates (x1,...,xm,y1,...,ym) such that J(∂  /  ∂xa) = ∂  /  ∂ya,  J(∂  /  ∂ya) =  - ∂  /  ∂xa. Setting then za = xa + iya and taking Xa  =  ∂  /  ∂xa one gets

[formula]

where ∂A  =  ∂  /  ∂zA and [formula]. It appears that (za) form an atlas of complex (analytic) coordinate charts on M. Now, by using Christoffel formulae, one gets

[formula]

[formula]

Then the following holds (see also [\cite=BFFV3] [\cite=Iva]): Theorem 2.2.  Let M be a m-dimensional complex manifold, seen as a real 2m-dimensional manifold with a complex structure J. Let us further assume that M is provided with an anti-Hermitian metric g. We extend J, g and the Levi-Civita connection [formula] by [formula]-linearity to the complexified tangent bundle TMC. Then the following conditions are equivalent:

(i)

[formula]

where X and Y are arbitrary real vectorfields;

(ii) in all (local) complex coordinate systems (z1,...,zm) on M the (complex) Christoffel symbols satisfy

[formula]

(iii) in all (local) complex coordinate systems (z1,...,zm) on M the components of the complex extended metric gab have the canonical form (3) and moreover they are holomorphic functions, i.e.

[formula]

Proof. From ([\ref=b4]) we have

[formula]

The connection satisfies the conditions

[formula]

[formula]

if and only if

[formula]

This proves the equivalence between (i) and (ii). Then for the Christoffel symbols ([\ref=b7]), by taking ([\ref=b1]) into account one gets

[formula]

and from ([\ref=b11]) it follows that

[formula]

Also the other relations ([\ref=b11]) are reduced to ([\ref=b13]) or its complex conjugate. Therefore the relation ([\ref=b13]) is equivalent to ([\ref=b10]). This proves the equivalence between (i) and (iii). Our claim is thence proved. (Q.E.D.)

Chern Classes of anti-Kählerian  manifolds

Here we consider some conditions on a manifold for the existence of an anti-Kählerian  metric. Let (M,J,g) be an anti-Kählerian  manifold. Then M is a complex manifold and according to Theorem 2.2 there exists a holomorphic metric on M. Therefore there is a complex isomorphism between the complex tangent bundle τ and its dual τ*. From the known properties of the Chern classes cj(τ*) = ( - 1)jcj(τ) one gets the following:

Proposition 3.1.   All odd Chern classes of an anti-Kählerian  manifold M vanish:

[formula]

The following proposition shows that if a simply connected manifold is Kählerian  then it cannot be anti-Kählerian.

Proposition 3.2.   If M is a compact simply connected Kählerian  manifold then it does not admit an anti-Kählerian  metric.

Proof. If c1(M)  ≠  0 then according to proposition 3.1 the manifold M cannot be anti-Kählerian. Now if c1(M) = 0 and M is a compact simply connected Kählerian  manifold then by a theorem due to Kobayashi [\cite=Kob] we have Γ(SmTM) = Γ(SmT*M) = 0 for m > 0 and therefore M does not admit a holomorphic metric. So it cannot be anti-Kählerian. (Q.E.D.)

Examples of anti-Kählerian  manifolds

Let us now consider the question: which manifolds may admit an anti-Kählerian  structure?

Let us first discuss compact manifolds. According to Proposition 3.1, in a compact complex manifold (M,J) which admits a holomorphic metric all odd Chern numbers must vanish: c2j + 1(M) = 0. In complex dimension 1 one has χ(M) = c1(M) = 0, where χ(M) is the Euler cheracteristic of M; therefore M is a torus. On any torus one has a holomorphic metric and the corresponding real anti-Kählerian  metric will be Lorentzian.

In complex dimension 2, if M is a regular (i.e., without holomorphic 1-forms) compact connected (complex) surface with vanishing first Chern class, then it is a K3 surface; moreover it is known that any K3 surface is Kählerian  [\cite=Siu] and simply connected and therefore, in virtue of Proposition 3.2, it does not admit a holomorphic metric. We have then to consider irregular surfaces to find anti-Kählerian  manifolds.

An interesting open question is whether the Hopf manifolds S2p + 1  ×  S2q + 1 admit anti-Kählerian  metrics.

Let us present now a large class of anti-Kählerian  manifolds. A m-dimensional complex manifold M is called (complex) parallelisable if there exist m holomorphic vector fields e1,...,em which are everywhere linearly independent in M. Every complex Lie group G is parallelisable. If D is a discrete subgroup of G then the complex manifold G / D is also parallelisable [\cite=KN]. Conversely, Wang proved [\cite=Wang] [\cite=KN] that every compact parallelisable manifold can be presented as the factor space G / D of a complex Lie group G over a discrete subgroup D.

Proposition 4.1.  Every complex parallelisable manifold M is an anti-Kählerian  manifold.

Proof. Let us take a complex chart (zμ),  μ = 1,...,m, on M and let (eμa) be the components of the independent holomorphic vector fields in this chart,a = 1,...,m. Since the vectorfields are linearly independent the inverse matrix faμ defines m holomorphic covectorfields eμafbμ  =  δba. Now let us set

[formula]

Then gμν is a holomorphic metric on M. Therefore the manifold M is anti-Kählerian. (Q.E.D.)

It would be interesting to know if every (compact) anti-Kählerian  manifold is complex parallelisable.

Remark. It is known that between complex parallelisable manifolds only the tori admit Kählerian  metrics [\cite=Wang].

Anti Kählerian Einstein manifolds

In this section we show that by taking the real part of a holomorphic Einstein metric on a complex manifold of complex dimension m one gets a real Einstein manifold of real dimension 2m. Recall that a metric g is said to be an Einstein metric if

[formula]

where γ is a real constant and Ric(g) denotes the Ricci tensor of the metric g, i.e. Rμν = Rτμτν, where Riem(g) = Rτμρν is the Riemann curvature tensor of the metric g.

The following theorem relating the real and complex Einstein equations holds true:

Theorem 5.1.  Suppose that (M,g,J) is an anti-Kählerian manifold, i.e. a complex manifold of complex dimension m with a holomorphic metric [formula] and a real metric [formula], μ,ν = 1,...,2m defined by (3). Then the holomorphic metric gab(z) is Einstein if and only if the real metric gμν(x) is a solution of the Einstein equations (14). In other words we have: Ric(g) = γg iff Ric(ĝ) = γĝ, i.e. in components:

[formula]

To prove Theorem 5.1 we need first the following lemma, whose proof is just a simple modification of the technical proof of Proposition 3.6 in [\cite=KN] for the Kählerian case.

Lemma 5.2.  The Riemann Riem(g) and the Ricci Ric(g) tensors of the (real) anti-Hermitian metric g of an anti-Kählerian manifold (M,g,J) satisfy the conditions:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

for each X,Y∈χ(M).

Notice that (15c) is a simple combination of (15a-b) and the first Bianchi identity (see also Lemma 1.1 in [\cite=BB]).

We can now prove Theorem 5.1. We shall not discuss here the Einstein equations for a generic metric of the form (3) but consider only the case when gab is a holomorphic function. From (10) and (15a-b) we get then for the Riemann tensor:

[formula]

Moreover, the Christoffel symbols and Riemann tensor are given (in complex coordinates) by the classical formulae:

[formula]

and

[formula]

(see also [\cite=LeB] p. 174, where complex-analytic self-dual Einstein metrics have been studied with some details). Our aim is to establish a link between the complex Ricci tensor [formula] and the real one [formula].

Define [formula] then [formula], where [formula] means the (real) trace of the [formula]-linear endomorphism R̂(X,Y):TxM  →  TxM. Due to (15c) [formula], i.e. R̂(X,Y) is [formula]-linear on (TxM,J). It implies that the trace of the endomorphism R̂(X,Y) (or its [formula]-linear extension into TCxM) do satisfy

[formula]

Now, from (16) the complex Ricci tensor Rab is related with the real one Rμν via Proposition 2.1 . In particular, analogously to (1) we have

[formula]

The (complex) Einstein equations

[formula]

are thus equivalent to a pair of equations

[formula]

[formula]

To get a real solution of Einstein equations (14) from (19) one uses then real coordinates (xμ),μ = 1,...,2m on M, i.e. za = xa + ixm + a,a = 1,...,m and writes the real Ricci tensor Rμν in the form (3)

[formula]

The result then follows.(Q.E.D.)

Remark 5.3.  Recall from [\cite=BFFV3] that beside the original metric g one has to our disposal, on an anti-Kählerian  manifold (M,G,J), another real metric of neutral signature so called twin metric: [formula]. One finds

[formula]

Since [formula] and Jμν  =  hμαgαν both metrics have the same (real and complex) Christoffel symbols: [formula], thus the same (real and complex) Riemann and Ricci tensors. In the real case only one of two twin metrics can be Einstenian. In complex coordinates Rab(gcd) = γgab implies Rab(hcd) =  - iγhab , i.e. both holomorphic metrics are Einstein metrics at the same time. One can say, in this way, that the metric h is an Einstein metric with an imaginary cosmological constant.

The last Theorem can be used to construct a "tower" of solutions of Einstein equations. Let be given a real analytic n-dimensional Einstein manifold Mn with the Einstein metric gαβ(x):Rαβ(g) = γgαβ. Let 2n be a certain complex analytic extension (complexification) of the manifold Mn ([formula]) with the complex analytic metric ĝab(z) which is an analytic continuation of the original metric gαβ(x) (see [\cite=Shu] [\cite=Man] [\cite=Fla]). The pair (2n,ĝ) is an anti-Kählerian  manifold since ĝ is automatically analytic. Moreover, one has the (complex) Einstein equation Rab(ĝ) = γĝab where Rab(ĝ) is obtained from ĝab(z) by using the standard formulae for the Ricci tensor with partial derivatives with respect to the complex coordinates za (see also (18) and [\cite=LeB] p.174). This is so because all steps in the algorithm for calculating the Ricci tensor (e.g., taking the inverse metric, computing partial derivatives, multiplications, etc..) do commute with the operation of analytic continuation g(x)  ↦  ĝ(z). Now, by taking the real part of ĝabdzadzb one gets a new analytic (real) metric of neutral signature on the 2n-dimensional real manifold 2n. On virtue of Theorem 5.1 this new metric is again Einsteinian. We can continue in this way and get a 4n- dimensional real analytic Einstein metric, then the 8n-dimensional and so on.

To produce a whole family of examples one can take the complex analytic continuations of all real analytic solutions of Einstein equations. We give here a simple concrete example. Take the standard Einstein metric on the m-dimensional sphere [formula]. After analytic continuation one gets:

[formula]

This metric gμν lives on "the complex sphere" SmC (w21 + ... + w2m + 1 = 1), which can be interpreted as a quadric ζ21 + ... + ζ2m + 1  -  ζ2m + 2 = 0 in [formula] if one takes wi  =  ζi  /  ζm + 2. It gives a solution of the Einstein equations (14) and provides an example of an anti - Hermitian Einstein manifold (M,g,J). As a real manifold the complex sphere SmC is diffeomorphic to the tangent bundle TSm. In particular for m = 2 we get a real solution of Einstein equations on the 4-dimensional, non-compact real manifold TS2 with a metric of Kleinian signature ( +  +  -  - ).

Notice also that any Einstein metric on a compact Riemannian manifold Mn leads to an anti-Kählerian Einstein metric on another real manifold 2n. It follows from known facts [\cite=Bou] that any Einstein metric is analytic in a certain atlas on Mn. Therefore there exists a complex analytic continuation of the metric to a complex manifold of complex dimension n which is a real anti-Kählerian manifold 2n.
