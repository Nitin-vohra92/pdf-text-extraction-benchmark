Abstract  Cohen, Lewin and Zagier found four ladders that entail the polylogarithms [formula] at order n = 16, with indices [formula], and α1 being the smallest known Salem number, i.e. the larger real root of Lehmer's celebrated polynomial α10  +  α9  -  α7  -  α6  -  α5  -  α4  -  α3  +  α + 1, with the smallest known non-trivial Mahler measure. By adjoining the index k = 630, we generate a fifth ladder at order 16 and a ladder at order 17 that we presume to be unique. This empirical integer relation, between elements of [formula] and [formula], entails 125 constants, multiplied by integers with nearly 300 digits. It has been checked to more than 59,000 decimal digits. Among the ladders that we found in other number fields, the longest has order 13 and index 294. It is based on α10  -  α6  -  α5  -  α4 + 1, which gives the sole Salem number α < 1.3 with degree d < 12 for which α1 / 2  +  α- 1 / 2 fails to be the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of a graph. a) This work was supported by the Director, Office of Computational and Technology Research, Division of Mathematical, Information, and Computational Sciences of the U.S. Department of Energy, under contract number DE-AC03-76SF00098. b) Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, MS 50B-2239, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA dhbailey@lbl.gov c) Open University, Department of Physics, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, UK D.Broadhurst@open.ac.uk

Introduction

The findings reported here arose from the discovery by the second author that

[formula]

where α is one of the 10 algebraic integers of Lehmer's remarkable number field [\cite=DHL]

[formula]

Once found, the cyclotomic relation ([\ref=a630]) was proven by (oft) repeated substitution for α10. It led us to believe that a valid ladder of polylogarithms exists at order n = 17, contrary to a suggestion in [\cite=DZ]. Indeed, we were able to adjoin the index k = 630 to those with [formula], found by Henri Cohen, Leonard Lewin and Don Zagier [\cite=CLZ], and obtain

[formula]

ladders at orders [formula]. In particular, at n = 17, we found 125 non-zero integers a, bj, ck, with less than 300 digits, such that an empirical relation

[formula]

holds to more than 59,000 decimal digits, where

[formula]

is the larger real root of ([\ref=a10]), and the 115 indices k in [formula] are drawn from the set, D(S), of positive integers that divide at least one element of

[formula]

The coefficient of ζ(17) was partially factorized as follows

[formula]

where

[formula]

is a 217-digit non-prime, whose factorization has not yet been obtained. The integers in ([\ref=result]) were obtained using less than 4,000 digits of working precision. The chance of a numerical accident is thus less than 10- 55000.

In section 2, we review the algorithm for generating such ladders from cyclotomic relations [\cite=DZ]. In section 3, we describe our computational strategy, based on the PSLQ integer relation finder [\cite=ppslq]. In section 4, we study ladders based on Salem numbers larger than ([\ref=alpha]), commenting on a connection to graph theory, observed with Gert Almkvist.

Ladder building in self-reciprocal number fields

Consider the cyclotomic polynomials, Φk(x), defined recursively by

[formula]

A real algebraic number x > 1 is said to satisfy a cyclotomic relation with index k if there exist rational numbers [formula] such that

[formula]

For example, identity ([\ref=a630]) establishes that α1 - the smallest known Salem number, and also the smallest known non-trivial Mahler measure - satisfies a cyclotomic relation with index k = 630, which is 63 times larger than the degree of α1. This ratio is larger than any heretofore discovered, the previous [\cite=CLZ] record being k / d = 36.

A Salem number is a real algebraic integer, α > 1, of degree d = 2 + 2s, with 2s > 0 conjugates on the unit circle and the remaining conjugate, 1 / α, inside it. For any monic polynomial, P, with integer coefficients, the Mahler measure, M(P), is the product of the absolute values of the roots outside the unit circle. Thus a Salem number is the Mahler measure of its minimal polynomial. Derrick Lehmer [\cite=DHL] conjectured that there exists a constant c > 1 such that M(P)  ≥  c for all M(P) > 1. A stronger form of this conjecture is that c = α1, the Mahler measure of ([\ref=a10]), found by Lehmer more than 60 years ago, and still [\cite=DWB1] [\cite=DWB2] [\cite=MJM] the smallest known M(P) > 1.

In describing how to build a polylogarithmic ladder, we shall restrict attention to an algebraic number field whose defining polynomial, P(x) = xdP(1 / x), of even degree d, is reciprocal (i.e. palindromic), as in ([\ref=a10]). Moreover, we require at least one real root with x > 1. Hence the discussion encompasses all Salem numbers. We define cyclotomic norms [\cite=DZ]

[formula]

where the product is over all roots of P(x), so that Nk is an integer. Then a necessary condition for a cyclotomic relation of index k is that every prime factor of Nk is also a factor of a norm Nj with j < k. This simplifies, considerably, the business of finding all indices of cyclotomic relations, up to some maximum value, which we set at 1800, i.e. five times larger than the previous record k = 360, set by [\cite=CLZ].

First, one rules out indices that fail the factorization criterion. Then, for each surviving k, one performs an integer relation search, at suitably chosen numerical precision, using the constants log x, log Φk(x) and a subset of { log Φj(x)|j < k} that is consistent with the requirement that

[formula]

be satisfiable by rational numbers Aj. Moreover, this subset can be further - and often greatly - reduced by exploiting the cyclotomic relations with indices less than k. In fact, we obtained integer values of Aj that vanish for each j > d / 2 that does not divide k.

For each putative cyclotomic relation thus indicated by a numerically discovered integer relation between logarithms, one has merely to use the defining polynomial, to eliminate xd, via a computer algebra program, hence proving (or if one is very unlucky disproving) the numerically suggested relation. This is how we discovered and proved the cyclotomic relation ([\ref=a630]), with index k = 630, in the number field defined by Lehmer's polynomial ([\ref=a10]). We are also strongly convinced that there is no cyclotomic relation with [formula] in Lehmer's number field.

Taking the log of a cyclotomic relation, with a real root x > 1, one proves the vanishing of a combination of logarithms of the form

[formula]

where the logarithm Li1(y): =  -  log (1 - y) is merely the n = 1 case of the polylogarithm [formula], with order n, and the rational numbers Bj are easily obtained from the rational numbers Aj in the cyclotomic relation ([\ref=cycr]).

Next, we define polylogarithmic combinations

[formula]

where the superscript indicates that they all vanish at n = 1. In general, these do not vanish at n = 2. Rather, one finds [\cite=LL/AMS] that combinations of them evaluate to rational multiples of ζ(2) = π2 / 6.

Suppose that several Q-linear combinations of the constructs ([\ref=plog]) evaluate to rational multiples of π2 at n = 2, so that

[formula]

with a rational matrix C(2) yielding a rational vector D(2), where the superscript indicates that we have exploited empirical data at order n = 2. Then one forms a vector whose components

[formula]

vanish at n = 2. At n = 3, one seeks Q-linear combinations of ([\ref=v2]) that evaluate, empirically, to rational multiples of ζ(3). However, these are not yet the constructs to carry forward to orders n > 3; one must form combinations that vanish at n = 3. In a self-reciprocal number field, this cannot be done by a subtraction similar to that in ([\ref=v2]), since ζ(3) does not appear in the formula [\cite=LL] for inverting the argument of a polylogarithm.

Thus the generic iteration is to form combinations

[formula]

that vanish for n = 2p + 1, and then combinations

[formula]

that vanish for n = 2p + 2.

The vital issue is this: how does the number of valid ladders decrease at each iteration? Don Zagier observed that the answer depends on the signature of the number field [\cite=DZ]. Suppose that the polynomial P(x) has r > 0 real roots and s pairs of complex roots, so that the degree is d = r + 2s. (Note that r = 2 and s > 0 in the particular case of a Salem number.) Since we restrict attention to reciprocal polynomials, both r and d are even. (In particular, the Lehmer polynomial has r = 2, s = 4, d = 10.) Given N(2p) ladders that evaluate to rational multiples of π2p at order n = 2p, one expects

[formula]

ladders that evaluate to rational multiples of ζ(2p + 1) at order n = 2p + 1, and

[formula]

ladders that evaluate to rational multiples of π2p + 2 at order n = 2p + 2. The + 1 in ([\ref=ito]) occurs because one may include the index k = 0, corresponding to ζ(2p + 1); the - 1 in ([\ref=ite]) because this odd zeta value may not be carried forward. The - d / 2 in ([\ref=ito]) occurs because of conditions on the functionally independent real parts of polylogs of odd order, in a self-reciprocal number field; the - s in ([\ref=ite]) because of conditions on the imaginary parts of polylogs of even order.

For a self-reciprocal number field with degree d = 2 + 2s - and hence for any Salem number - it follows that C cyclotomic relations are expected to generate

[formula]

rational multiples of ζ(n) at order [formula].

By way of example, the self-reciprocal number field α2 - 3α + 1 = 0 has C = 4 cyclotomic relations, with indices k = 1,6,10,12. There are thus 5 - ⌊n / 2⌋ valid ladders at orders [formula]. At n = 9, there is an integer relation

[formula]

where [formula] is the golden ratio and f, gj, hk are essentially unique integers, with indices k dividing 10 or 12. In this very simple case, empirical [\cite=LL/AMS] determination of

[formula]

requires only Euclid's algorithm, to find the rational ratio of each previously vanishing ladder to the current zeta value.

Much more impressively, Cohen, Lewin and Zagier [\cite=CLZ] found 71 cyclotomic relations with indices [formula], for the smallest known Salem number, with d = 10. Thus they obtained [formula] valid ladders at order n = 16, yet no relation at n = 17.

The Lehmer ladder of order 17

The tables on pages 368-370 of [\cite=LL/AMS] exhaust the cyclotomic relations with indices [formula] in the Lehmer number field. It seemed to us peculiarly inconvenient that this tally was precisely one short of what is needed to generate a rational multiple of ζ(17). It was also clear how to look for "the one that got away". We calculated the norms Nk of [formula] and found only one candidate with small factors, namely N630 = N126 = 56. It seemed likely that Φ630(α) / Φ126(α) was party to a cyclotomic relation. Taking logarithms and using PSLQ, we readily found the numerical relation

[formula]

which was then proven by repeated substitution for α101. It entails terms of the form αj1 - 1, where j is one of the 24 divisors of 630. These may be halved in number, as in ([\ref=a630]), by eliminating the 12 divisors j∈{6,7,9,10,18,21,30,42,45,63,70,105}, which are themselves [\cite=LL/AMS] indices of cyclotomic relations.

Proceeding to dilogarithms, we then needed to perform only 6-dimensional searches for integer relations, between the constants ζ(2) and {L(1)j(2)|j = 6,7,8,9,k}, in the 68 cyclotomic cases with [formula]. This resulted in the 67 dilogarithmic ladders of [\cite=LL/AMS] and one new ladder, namely the integer relation

[formula]

whose index, k = 630, exceeds anything found previously. We remark that the coefficients of {Li2(α- j1)|9 < j < 630} are determined by ([\ref=a630]) and that the empirical coefficient of ζ(2) is a 4-digit prime, namely 2003.

At this juncture, we were faced by a computational dilemma: how should one process empirical rational data, at orders n < 17, so as fastest to determine the final order-17 ladder? There are two radically opposed strategies: one systematic, though numerically intensive; the other interventionist, though requiring less numerical precision. In the first approach, one takes no heed of the explosion of primes, such as 2003 at n = 2. Rather, one adopts the simplest procedure of eliminating the predicted number of indices from the lowest currently available, as in the case above with n = 2, where the indices k = 6,7,8,9 were eliminated in passing from 72 cyclotomic relations to 68 dilogarithmic relations. This already differs from the choice adopted by Lewin in [\cite=LL/AMS], who chose to eliminate the indices k = 7,8,9,10, leaving k = 6 as a survivor. The latter choice might, at some intermediate stage, produce integers considerably smaller than those in our method, yet it is difficult to automate an objective criterion that will efficiently limit the growth of scheme-dependent integers at all orders n < 17. Since we envisage a unique valid ladder at order 17, the choice of strategy should not affect the final result. Rather, it affects the working precision that is required.

Happily, the choice is not crucial, since state-of-the-art implementation [\cite=ppslq] of the PSLQ algorithm enables a 6-dimensional search in seconds, when the relation involves integers with less than 600 digits. Thus we were able to experiment at lower orders. The rule of thumb which emerged is this: sub-optimal intermediate integers, produced by systematic elimination of the lowest indices currently available, rarely exceed the squares of those that might be achieved by laborious optimization.

This suggested that systematic elimination would be likely to get us fastest to the ultimate goal, without need for any tuning. It transpired that the task was indeed as easy as we had supposed, since the integer a in ([\ref=ais]) has merely 288 digits, and all the other integers in ([\ref=result]) have less than 300 digits. At no stage did we encounter, in our systematic approach, an integer with more than 600 digits, consistent with the rule of thumb. Thus, in searches with merely 6 constants, we needed less than 4,000-digit working precision, which placed no significant burden on MPFUN [\cite=mpfun] [\cite=mpf90] or PSLQ [\cite=ppslq] [\cite=cpslq].

We remark that on a 433 MHz DecAlpha machine it took 139 seconds to compute the constants {Li17(α- k1)|k∈D(S)} to 4,000 digits. It then took merely 9 seconds for PSLQ to find an integer relation between ζ(17) and the 5 valid ladders that had survived from the previous iteration. Unravelling all the iterations, we then expressed the final - and presumably unique - result in the form ([\ref=result]). Of the 117 divisors of ([\ref=DS]), two are not entailed by cyclotomic relations, namely k = 51 and k = 53. Among the 115 non-zero integers ck, the cyclotomic input guarantees the triviality of 19 ratios, namely

[formula]

where, for example, the final ratio results from ([\ref=simple]) and in the particular case of ([\ref=result]) the order is n = 17. Moreover, the logarithms of ([\ref=result]) may be removed by replacing Lin(y) by the Rogers-type polylogarithm [\cite=LL/AMS]

[formula]

which slightly modifies Kummer's [\cite=LL] [formula], by an inessential normalization factor, and by a Kronecker delta term, at r = 1. The latter completes the process of removal of logs from functional equations, almost achieved by Kummer. Thus the core of relation ([\ref=result]) is specified by the coefficient ([\ref=ais]) of ζ(17) and 96 integers ck, from which the full set of 115 is trivially generated. Analyzing these 97 integers in pairs, we found no pair with a common prime factor greater than 1973, which divides both c1 and c57. From this, one sees that brute-force application of PSLQ would require nearly 30,000 digits of precision to reconstruct the relation, without benefit of further theory. In fact, 4,000 digits were more than enough to ascend the ladder ([\ref=ito],[\ref=ite]), rung by rung.

We presume that the coefficient ([\ref=ais]) of ζ(17) is essentially unique, making it a remarkable integer in the theory of polylogarithms. Its 217-digit factor ([\ref=C217]) is certainly composite, yet has so far resisted factorization by Richard Crandall and his colleagues Karl Dilcher, Richard McIntosh and Alan Powell, whose large-integer code [\cite=REC] efficiently implements an elliptic curve method [\cite=RPB]. Its presence makes it very unlikely that one could discover the final integer relation ([\ref=result]) with less than 1,000 digits of working precision, however hard one tried to emulate the feats of [\cite=CLZ], by interventions that limit the growth of scheme-dependent integers at lower orders. By contrast, the ladder given in [\cite=CLZ], at order n = 16, involved integers with no more than 71 digits, which we shall shortly reduce by 11 digits. Nonetheless, we are left speechless with admiration for the achievement of Henri Cohen in attaining order n = 16 with only 305-digit precision, from Pari.

To check ([\ref=result]), we computed more than 59,000 digits of {Li17(α- k1)|k∈D(S)}, using

[formula]

which conveniently reduces the 114 cases with k > 1 to subsets of the additions for k = 1. To compute ζ(17), we set p = 4 in the identity

[formula]

which corrects the upper limit of the first sum and the sign of the second term of the second summand in Proposition 2 of [\cite=CLZ]. The corrected companion identity simplifies to

[formula]

At p = 0, one finds that ([\ref=z4p]) evaluates to 1 / 4 and ([\ref=z4m]) to - 1 / 12, as expected.

Setting n = 17 in ([\ref=elem]), we obtained the 115 polylogarithmic constants to a precision of [formula] binary digits. Substituting these in ([\ref=result]), with the integers found by PSLQ at less than 4,000-digit precision, we reproduced the first 59,157 decimal places of the value of ζ(17) from ([\ref=z4p]). The chance of a spurious result is thus less than 10- 55000.

Thanks to PSLQ, we are able to scrutinize an inference in [\cite=CLZ], concerning the role of 3617, the numerator of the Bernoulli number B16, and hence of ζ(16) / π16. Appendix A of [\cite=CLZ] gives one of four empirical integer relations found at order n = 16, with indices [formula]. It is of a form

[formula]

On the left, one encounters in [\cite=CLZ] 111 non-zero integers, with up to 71 digits, and on the right a0 has 75 digits. This led the authors of [\cite=CLZ] to infer that ladders do not pick up non-trivial numerators of Bernoulli numbers, since the relation appears more natural when written in terms of π16. However, such evidence was adduced without knowledge of the cyclotomic index k = 630.

Our first remark is that no firm conclusion may be drawn from Appendix A of [\cite=CLZ], since it contains integers with 11 digits more than is necessary. We emphasize that this does not indicate a failure of Pari's LLL [\cite=LLL] algorithm in [\cite=CLZ]. Rather, it shows that a new analysis is required by ([\ref=a630]). Using PSLQ, we obtained 5 independent integer relations of the symmetrical form

[formula]

with integers sk having no more than 62 digits and Euclidean norms in the narrow range

[formula]

We also obtained 5 asymmetrical relations of the form ([\ref=3617]), with norms

[formula]

Comparison of ([\ref=norms]) with ([\ref=norma]) leaves the issue moot. Moreover, these ranges were unchanged by application of the LLL algorithm. An indication of the slight superiority of the asymmetrical form ([\ref=3617]) is obtained by asking LLL to reduce the restricted norms that omit the integer a0. This produced 5 asymmetrical relations with

[formula]

The integer relation with the smallest restricted norm is presented in Table 1, whose 115 integers have no more than 60 digits and yield the 64-digit integer

[formula]

with factors found after running [\cite=REC] for a total of 466 CPUhours, on a cluster of 8 machines.

As further indication that powers of π2, rather than even zeta values, are the constants favoured by polylogarithm ladders, we remark that b8 in ([\ref=result]) is not divisible by 3617, and that b6 is not divisible by 691, the numerator of ζ(12) / π12. Further information on the role of Bernoulli numerators in polylogarithm ladders could be obtained if one found a base in which there is a unique valid ladder of order n = 12 or order n = 16. We hold out no lively hope for the latter. In search of the former, we turn to larger Salem numbers.

Ladders from larger Salem numbers

There are 47 known [\cite=MJM] Salem numbers less than 1.3. Of these, 45 exhaust the possibilities with α < 1.3 and degree d < 42. Of these, merely 6 have degree d < 12. Of these 6, we noted that all but one solve equations of the very simple form

[formula]

with m > 0 and

[formula]

The case m = 1 gives Lehmer's number field. The minimal polynomials of the first five Salem numbers in this family are

[formula]

with approximate numerical roots - and hence Mahler measures - given by

[formula]

As m  →    ∞  , one obtains the real root of ([\ref=Q]), namely

[formula]

which is the smallest algebraic integer, α > 1, with conjugates that all lie inside the unit circle, i.e. the smallest Pisot-Vijayaragharvan (PV) number.

We were alerted to the existence of this family of Salem numbers by graph theory. Gert Almkvist told the second author of a fascinating remark on page 247 of the book [\cite=GHJ] by Frederick Goodman, Pierre de la Harpe and Vaughan Jones, on Coxeter graphs. There they are concerned with the smallest possible value, greater than 2, for the largest eigenvalue, λ max, in the spectrum of a graph. They classify all finite connected graphs with φ1 / 2  +  φ- 1 / 2  ≥  λ max > 2 where [formula] is the golden ratio, and hence prove that the smallest possible λ max > 2 is obtained from the tree graph T2,3,7, formed when three straight lines, with 2, 3, and 7 vertices, are joined by identifying three univalent vertices. The characteristic polynomial of its adjacency matrix is

[formula]

which is, intriguingly, related to Lehmer's polynomial ([\ref=a10]). The relation - which is not correctly stated in [\cite=GHJ] - is

[formula]

which proves that the largest eigenvalue of T2,3,7 is

[formula]

Thanks to help from Gert Almkvist, we proved that this generalizes to the relation

[formula]

between the largest eigenvalue of the tree graph T2,3,6 + m and the Salem number obtained from ([\ref=family]), at any m > 0.

Thus this family of graphs generates a monotonically increasing family of Salem numbers, starting at the smallest yet known and tending to the provably smallest PV number ([\ref=ainf]). It is proven [\cite=GHJ] that ([\ref=la]) is the smallest value, λ max > 2, for the largest eigenvalue of any graph. Sadly, this does not prove that Lehmer's α1 is the smallest Salem number.

Since Lehmer's number field generates the new record, n = 17, for the order of a polylogarithmic ladder, we thought it interesting to examine ladders based on further members of the family of graphs T2,3,6 + m. By way of benchmark, we recall that the square of the golden ratio generates ladder ([\ref=golden]), with order n = 9 and index k = 12. The smallest PV number ([\ref=ainf]) also reaches n = 9, with index k = 42 [\cite=LL/AMS]. In [\cite=z3z5], order n = 11 was attained, from cyclotomic relations that also led to algorithms for finding the ten millionth hexadecimal digits of ζ(3) and ζ(5), without computing previous digits. To our knowledge, n = 11 had been bettered, heretofore, only in the Lehmer number field.

We were intrigued to know the maximum orders achievable in bases derived from trees T2,3,6 + m with m > 1. Accordingly, we studied the cyclotomic relations of ([\ref=family]), with m < 6, and found Nm(n) ladders, for base αm at order n > 1, with

[formula]

The number of cyclotomic relations decreases monotonically, as the Mahler measure increases from α1 to α5. However α4 carries the advantage of having the lowest degree, d = 8, among Salem numbers from trees T2,3,6 + m. The explanation is that the characteristic polynomial of the adjacency matrix of tree T2,3,10 is

[formula]

with the same largest eigenvalue as for tree T2,4,5, which is the first of a family of trees T2,4,4 + m whose largest eigenvalues are β1 / 2m  +  β- 1 / 2m, where the Salem number βm solves

[formula]

with m > 0 and

[formula]

These Salem numbers increase monotonically, from β1  =  α4, to

[formula]

which is the PV number obtained from ([\ref=R]). As seen from ([\ref=n4]), the first of these Salem numbers gives valid ladders up to n = 12. These entail 62 indices that divide elements of

[formula]

Finding two valid ladders at order n = 12, we obtained no definitive answer regarding the appearance of 691, the numerator of ζ(12) / π12.

This study of graphical number fields led to the observation that the Salem number

[formula]

that solves

[formula]

is rather special. It is the sole Salem number α < 1.3 with degree d < 12 for which α1 / 2  +  α- 1 / 2 is not the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of a graph. We note that Gary Ray [\cite=GAR] identified ([\ref=notpol]) as a potentially fruitful source of polylogarithm identities, along with ([\ref=P1],[\ref=P4]).

Accordingly, we sought its cyclotomic relations and hence its polylogarithmic ladders, finding [formula] valid ladders at orders [formula]. At n = 13, we found an integer relation of the form

[formula]

with integers (see footnote 1) u, vj and wk, where k runs over 86 divisors of elements of

[formula]

The coefficient of ζ(13) was factorized as follows

[formula]

where the 94-digit factor

[formula]

is (very) probably prime.

We believe that ([\ref=lad13]), with index k = 294, is the unique valid ladder of order n = 13 in the number field ([\ref=notpol]). In our investigations, the only number field that yielded orders n > 13 was Lehmer's. Thanks to the index k = 630 in ([\ref=a630]), the latter attains order n = 17. We expect this record to abide.

: The 115 integers ak in ([\ref=3617]) yield ([\ref=a0]) and have 11 digits less than those in Appendix A of [\cite=CLZ].
