Bounds on arithmetic projections, and applications to the Kakeya conjecture

Introduction

Let N be a positive integer, and let (Z, + ) be an abelian group. Let A, B, be finite subsets of Z with cardinality

[formula]

Let G be a subset of A  ×  B. We consider the question of bounding the quantity

[formula]

Without any further assumptions on G one can only obtain the trivial bound of N2. However, in [\cite=borg:high-dim] Bourgain showed that under the additional assumption

[formula]

that one could improve the bound on [\eqref=diff] to [formula]. The purpose of this paper is to obtain the following additional improvements.

Let the notation and assumptions be as above. Then we have

[formula]

If we make the further additional assumption

[formula]

then we may improve this further to

[formula]

It appears plausible that further improvements are possible by adding further assumptions of the type in [\eqref=c-card], [\eqref=d-card], but our methods do not seem to be able take advantage of such additional assumptions.

By the arguments in [\cite=borg:high-dim] this implies a bound on the Minkowski and Hausdorff dimensions of Besicovitch sets. Recall that a Besicovitch set in [formula], n  >  1 is a set which contains a unit line segment in every direction. The Kakeya conjecture states that such sets must have full dimension.

[\cite=borg:high-dim] Let E be a Besicovitch set in [formula]. Then the Minkowski dimension of E is at least [formula], while the Hausdorff dimension of E is at least [formula].

The lower bound of [formula] for both types of dimension was obtained in [\cite=wolff:kakeya]. Thus the Minkowski bound is new for n > 8 and the Hausdorff bound is new for n  >  12. We remark that Theorem [\ref=main] can also be used to slightly improve some other recent work on the Kakeya problem in [\cite=borg:high-dim] and [\cite=katzlabatao]. Roughly speaking, the connection between Besicovitch sets and Theorem [\ref=main] arises from taking A, B, C, D to essentially be the slices of the Besicovitch set at the hyperplanes {xn  =  0}, {xn  =  1}, {xn  =  1 / 2}, and {xn  =  2 / 3} respectively, and G to be the set of pairs in A  ×  B whose associated line segment is contained in the Besicovitch set. In principle the Hausdorff bound is improvable to match the Minkowski bound, but one must first prove an analogue of the results in [\cite=heath-brown], namely that that subsets of [formula], with density at least [formula] contain four distinct elements which are affinely equivalent to {0,1,1 / 2,2 / 3} if N is sufficiently large and ε sufficiently small. For recent progress on this type of problem see Gowers [\cite=gowers].

Bourgain's bound of [formula] was obtained using some ideas of Gowers [\cite=gowers] in his work on the Balog-Szemerédi theorem [\cite=balog]. Our arguments are more elementary, and will not yield any new results of Balog-Szemerédi type.

In the converse direction, a simple variant of an example in [\cite=ruzsa] shows that [\eqref=diff] can be as large as [formula] if one assumes [\eqref=c-card], or as large as Nlog (8) /  log (4)  =  N2  -  0.5 if one also assumes [\eqref=d-card]. To see the former claim, let n,M be large integers and and for every integer 0  ≤  a  <  Mn let [formula] be the digits of a base M, thus

[formula]

If we set Z to be the integers and

[formula]

(cf. [\cite=ruzsa]) then we easily see that the hypotheses are satisfied if M  ≥  7 with N  =  3n and [formula], hence the claim. The latter claim is similar but uses the sets

[formula]

and M  >  8.

A combinatorial lemma

We shall need the following combinatorial lemma.

Let X and [formula] be finite sets for some n  ≥  0, and for each 1  ≤  i  ≤  n let fi:X  →  Ai be a function. Then

[formula]

The reader may verify from probabilistic methods that [\eqref=iter] is sharp.

We prove by induction on n. The claim is trivial for n = 0. Now suppose that n  ≥  1, and the claim has been proven for n - 1.

Define an element a∈An to be popular if

[formula]

and define X' to be those elements x∈X such that fn(x) is popular. Since each unpopular element of An contributes at most #  X / (2  #  An) elements to X, we see that

[formula]

so

[formula]

By applying the induction hypothesis to X' we have

[formula]

Since fn(xn - 1) is popular, we thus have

[formula]

>From [\eqref=x-card] we thus have

[formula]

To eliminate the factor of 2- n, we let M be a large integer, and apply [\eqref=cool] with X, Ai replaced by XM, AMi, and fi replaced with the function fMi:XM  →  AMi defined by

[formula]

to obtain

[formula]

The claim then follows by letting M  →    ∞   (cf. [\cite=ruzsa]).

Proof of [\eqref=diff-6]

Fix A, B, C, N. By removing redundant elements of G, we may assume

[formula]

in which case we need to show

[formula]

Define the set

[formula]

By applying [\eqref=iter] with n = 1 and f1:G  →  A being the projection map, we see from [\eqref=ab-card] that

[formula]

Now consider the maps f1:V  →  C  ×  C, f2:V  →  B  ×  B, f3:V  →  C  ×  B by

[formula]

Let S denote the set

[formula]

from [\eqref=iter], [\eqref=ab-card] and eqrefc-card we have

[formula]

Write vi  =  (ai,bi,b'i) for i = 0,1,2,3, and consider the map g:S  →  V  ×  A  ×  B defined by

[formula]

We now observe that g is injective, or in other words that (v0,a2,b3) determines (v0,v1,v2,v3). To see this, we note from construction

[formula]

and

[formula]

>From [\eqref=first] we have

[formula]

while from [\eqref=second] we have

[formula]

Combining these equations, we obtain

[formula]

Thus a3  -  b'3 is determined by (v0,a2,b3). Since (a3,b'3)∈G, we see from [\eqref=one] that (a3,b'3), and thus v3, are determined by (v0,a2,b3). The injectivity of g then follows by using [\eqref=second] to determine v2, and then [\eqref=first] to determine v1.

Since g is injective, we have from [\eqref=ab-card] that

[formula]

Combining this with [\eqref=s-card] we see that

[formula]

and [\eqref=11-6] follows from [\eqref=v-card].

Proof of [\eqref=diff-4]

Fix A, B, C, D, N. We may assume [\eqref=one] as before, so that we need to show that

[formula]

Define V by [\eqref=vert] as before, and define the function f4:V  →  D  ×  B by

[formula]

Let T denote the set

[formula]

>From [\eqref=iter], [\eqref=ab-card], [\eqref=d-card] we have

[formula]

Write vi  =  (ai,bi,b'i) for i = 0,1, and define the map h:T  →  C  ×  C  ×  B by

[formula]

We claim that h is injective, so that h(v0,v1) determines (v0,v1). From construction we have

[formula]

so that

[formula]

Thus a1  -  b'1 is determined by h(v0,v1). From [\eqref=one] we thus see that (a1,b'1) is determined by h(v0,v1). The injectivity of h then follows from [\eqref=third].

Since h is injective, we see from [\eqref=ab-card] and [\eqref=c-card] that

[formula]

>From [\eqref=t-card] we thus have

[formula]

and [\eqref=targ-4] follows from [\eqref=v-card].
