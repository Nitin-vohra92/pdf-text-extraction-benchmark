The Building of Galactic Disks: Insights from the Triangulum Spiral Galaxy Messier 33

Introduction

Spiral galaxies appear to be dynamically open systems, whose disks are still forming at the current epoch and which continue to accrete mass. Isolated spiral galaxies (non-accreting systems) cannot reproduce the observed distribution of gravitational bar torques at all (see Figure 1 in Block et. al. [\cite=blocketal02]). In that study, it was argued that disk masses should double every 10 billion years. The most likely source for the origin of accreted gas could be the reservoirs of gas observed outside nearly all spiral disks (Sancisi [\cite=sancisi83]). Keres et al. ([\cite=keresetal05]) carefully discuss accretion in terms of filaments in the cosmic web. An extremely important point is that accreting systems in gas need not show any signs of accretion in stars, such as the presence of tidal tails, stellar loops or close companions. Disks of galaxies appear to form from the inside out (Block et al. [\cite=blocketal02]). Relative to the inner regions of spiral galaxies, the mean ages of the outer regions are known to be somewhat younger and more metal-poor (Bell and de Jong [\cite=belldejong00]). We can therefore expect the contribution from intermediate-age (0.6 Gyr -   2 Gyr) stars to be stronger in these outer regions, and the near-IR surface brightness of the outer disk will be preferentially enhanced by the presence of thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) stars. Although the average number of carbon stars per intermediate age cluster in the Magellanic clouds is only about 2.5 (Persson et al. [\cite=persson83]), they radiate such an enormous amount of light in the near-infrared that they contribute about 50 percent of the bolometric luminosity of the entire cluster.

There is no better place to start examining the accretion of gas in the outer domains of spiral disks than in our Local Group, and we focus our attention here on the Triangulum Spiral Galaxy M33. The history of the Andromeda Galaxy M31 is discussed elsewhere (Block et al. [\cite=blocketal06]). If accretion of gas is indeed taking place in M33, and if its disk is growing from the inside outwards, then one obvious tell-tale signature would be the presence of a red intermediate age population of carbon stars in its outer disk.

In an earlier study (Block et al. [\cite=blocketal04]), we presented near-infrared images of M33 from a deep subsample of 2MASS, in which individual stars were unresolved. The deep 2MASS images revealed remarkable arcs of red stars in the outer disk; the northern arc subtends [formula] in azimuth angle and ~  5' in width (see Figure [\ref=m33_2mass]). The northern arc is dominant although a very faint southern counterpart arc, forming a partial ring, can also be seen. The arcs lie at a radius of 2-3 disk lengths (in V, the disk scale length is 0.1 degree; Ferguson et al. [\cite=fergusonetal06]). Of course we are not claiming that carbon stars lie only in the two outer arcs, but we do claim that a combination of increased number density, perhaps aided by an increase in the IR integrated-light contribution of carbon stars relative to the underlying stellar population due to a metallicity gradient, makes them stand out in the infrared. That there is an increase in number density at the appropriate radius is confirmed by Rowe et al. (2005).

Fourier analysis of the light distribution shows that the dominant m = 2 peak corresponds to the giant arcs. The pitch angle of the dominant m = 2 structure is ~   58 degrees. It is these outer arcs, not the inner two-armed structure, which dominate the m = 2 Fourier spectra at the NIR.

Observations

Table [\ref=table_mag_cstars] lists the magnitudes and colors of 7 candidate targets in the outer northern arc. In deriving the absolute magnitudes in Table [\ref=table_mag_cstars], we assume a distance modulus to M33 of 24.64m, corresponding to a linear distance of 840 kpc (Freedman et al. [\cite=freedmanetal91]). Noting that (Wilson [\cite=wilson91]), and that the K-band extinction is approximately one-tenth that in the optical, we use a dust extinction correction for the Ks apparent magnitudes of 0.09 mag.

Spectra of our carbon star candidates were obtained on 2004 Aug 17 UT with the Low Resolution Imaging Spectrograph (LRIS; Oke et al. [\cite=okeetal95]) attached to the Keck I telescope.

Observations of M33 were also made using all four bands of the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) on 2005 January 21 as part of a Spitzer Guaranteed Time Observing Program (Program ID 5) conducted by Spitzer Science Working Group member R. D. Gehrz. The IRAC instrument (Fazio et al. [\cite=fazioetal04]) is composed of four detectors which operate at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 μm. All four detector arrays are 256x256 pixels in size with mean pixel scales of 1.221, 1.213, 1.222, and 1.220''- 1 respectively.

Discussion and Conclusions

Carbon stars show a plethora of molecular spectral features, including the C2 Swan bands and the CN bands. All stars in Table 1 as well as those imaged within the white circle (Figure 2) are spectroscopically confirmed to be carbon stars.

Figure 4 shows a PAH emissitivity radial profile in M33, generated from a scaled non-stellar IRAC 8μm - 3.6μm image. We find a dramatic change of phase in the PAH distribution at precisely the same radius where Corbelli and Schneider ([\cite=corbellischneider97]) find a warp in HI. Galactic warps and infall of gas are inextricably linked, as reviewed by Binney (1992).

The Keck spectra offers unique insight into how the disks of one of our closest spiral galaxies, M33, has evolved with time: it continues to grow by accretion of low-metallicity gas from the inside, outwards. The implications of the presence of carbon stars in the outer disk of M33 immediately beckons the question of a possible ubiquity of such an intermediate age population in the outer domains of other spiral disks. At hand is the potential to exploit our technique of identifying thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch carbon stars in the outer domains of more distant spirals on the basis of their near-infrared colours.
