Abstract

We define, on smooth manifolds, the notions of almost twistorial structure and twistorial map, thus providing a unified framework for all known examples of twistor spaces. The condition of being harmonic morphisms naturally appears among the geometric properties of submersive twistorial maps between low-dimensional Weyl spaces endowed with a nonintegrable almost twistorial structure due to Eells and Salamon. This leads to the twistorial characterisation of harmonic morphisms between Weyl spaces of dimensions four and three. Also, we give a thorough description of the twistorial maps with one-dimensional fibres from four-dimensional Weyl spaces endowed with the almost twistorial structure of Eells and Salamon.

Introduction

A predominant theme in the theory of harmonic maps is their relationship to holomorphicity. Right from their inception, harmonic maps have been recognised by Eells and Sampson to include holomorphic maps between Kähler manifolds, and a few years later, Lichnerowicz distinguished two sub-classes of almost Hermitian manifolds for which this also holds. A far harder task is to find conditions forcing harmonic maps to be holomorphic. The clearest situation is between two-spheres since harmonicity then implies conformality, but, in general, additional conditions are required, on the map or on curvature. From a Riemann surface, or a complex projective space, into a compact irreducible Hermitian symmetric space harmonic stability ensures holomorphicity [\cite=BBdBR] , [\cite=OhUd] . In the broader context of compact Kähler manifolds, Siu [\cite=Siu] used a [formula]-Bochner argument to prove, under strong negativity of the target curvature, the holomorphicity of rank four harmonic maps, from which he deduced the biholomorphicity of compact Kähler manifolds of the same homotopy type. Whilst these results are of great importance in understanding harmonic maps, this scheme bears its own natural limits, if only because it requires the presence of complex structures, with their topological consequences. To overcome this hurdle, one can replace the codomain with an adequate bundle admitting a natural complex structure, such that harmonicity of any map is given by holomorphicity of its lift to this bundle. This strategy, which could be traced to Calabi and even Weierstrass, was put into effect by Eells and Salamon [\cite=EelSal] , who modified a well-known twistor construction of Atiyah, Hitchin and Singer (see Example [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr4] , below) to define, in our terminology, an almost twistorial structure on any oriented four-dimensional Riemannian manifold (see Example [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr4'] ). This yields a bijective correspondence between conformal harmonic maps and holomorphic curves (see Proposition [\ref=prop:smoothtwistmap2to3'4'] ). These ideas were extensively pursued by Bryant [\cite=Bry-twistor] , and Burstall and Rawnsley [\cite=BurRaw-LNM] for (even-dimensional) Riemannian symmetric spaces. The success of this strategy leads naturally to considering lifts on both the domain and the codomain, hence removing any need of pre-existing almost complex structures. The objective is two-fold: firstly, show that the existence of a holomorphic lift implies harmonicity and, secondly, find natural conditions under which harmonic maps admit holomorphic lifts. As holomorphic maps are closed under composition, it seems that harmonic morphisms will have an important role in this programme. Besides, the very conformal nature of their characterization makes Weyl geometry an ideal framework for their study, but it also turns out to provide examples of twistor spaces in dimension two, three and four. In the complex category, a twistor, that is, a point of the twistor space of a (complex) manifold M, determines a submanifold, possibly, with self-intersections, of M. For example, the twistor space of an anti-self-dual complex-conformal four-dimensional manifold (M4,c) is the space of self-dual surfaces of (M4,c) ; also, the twistor space of a three-dimensional Einstein-Weyl space (M3,c,D) is the space of coisotropic surfaces of (M3,c) which are totally-geodesic with respect to D (see [\cite=PanWoo-sd] ). Similar considerations apply to the flat complex-conformal even-dimensional manifolds and to the complex-Riemannian manifolds of constant curvature (see [\cite=Pan-sp] ). Also, the space of isotropic geodesics of a complex-conformal manifold is, in a natural way, a twistor space [\cite=LeB-nullgeod] . A complex analytic map φ:M  →  N between manifolds endowed with twistorial structures is twistorial if it maps (some of the) twistors on M to twistors on N (see [\cite=PanWoo-sd] ). In this paper we extend the notions of almost twistorial structure and twistorial map, to the smooth category. We show that, in the smooth category, a twistor on a manifold M (endowed with a twistorial structure) is a pair (N,J) where N is a submanifold of M, possibly, with self-intersections, and J is a linear CR-structure on the normal bundle of N in M (Remark [\ref=rem:smoothtwiststr] ). These submanifolds may well just be points. For example, the twistor space of a four-dimensional anti-self-dual conformal manifold (M4,c) is formed of pairs (x,Jx) where x∈M and Jx is a positive orthogonal complex structure on (TxM,cx) . Similarly, the twistor space Z of a three-dimensional conformal manifold (M3,c) is a five-dimensional CR-manifold consisting of the orthogonal nontrivial CR-structures on (M3,c) [\cite=LeB-CR] (see Example [\ref=exm:nullgeodesics] and note that, if we assume (M3,c) real-analytic, then Z is a real hypersurface, endowed with the induced CR-structure, in the space of isotropic geodesics of the germ-unique complexification of (M3,c) ). On the other hand, the twistor space of a three-dimensional Einstein-Weyl space (see Example [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr3] and Theorem [\ref=thm:smoothtwist3]) is formed of pairs (γ,J) where γ is a geodesic and J is an orthogonal complex structure on the normal bundle of γ . The natural generalizations of this example, to Riemannian manifolds of constant curvature, are given in [\cite=Pan-sp] . As in the complex category, a (smooth) map φ:M  →  N between manifolds endowed with twistorial structures is twistorial if it maps twistors on M to twistors on N (Definition [\ref=defn:smoothtwistmap] ). It follows that twistorial maps naturally generalize holomorphic maps. Examples of twistorial maps have been previously used to obtain constructions of Einstein and anti-self-dual manifolds (see [\cite=Cal-sds] , [\cite=PanWoo-exm] , [\cite=PanWoo-sd] and the references therein). In Section 1, we recall a few basic facts on harmonic morphisms between Weyl spaces. Section 2 is preparatory for Sections 3 and 4 , where we give the definitions of almost twistorial structures and twistorial maps, on smooth manifolds. In Sections 3 and 4 , we also give examples of almost twistorial structures and twistorial maps. In the first part [\cite=LouPan] of this work, we introduced the notion of harmonic morphism between (complex-)Weyl spaces and we continued the study (initiated in [\cite=PanWoo-sd] ) of the relations between harmonic morphisms and twistorial maps. As all of the known examples of complex analytic almost twistorial structures have smooth versions, all of the main results of [\cite=LouPan] have 'real' versions. But not all smooth almost twistorial structures come from complex analytic almost twistorial structures. The first example of such an almost twistorial structure is the almost twistorial structure of Eells and Salamon, mentioned above. We introduce similar almost twistorial structures (Examples [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr3'] and [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr4'phi] ) with respect to which a map (between Weyl spaces of dimensions four and three) is twistorial if and only if it is a harmonic morphism (Theorem [\ref=thm:smoothtwistmap4'phi3'](i) ); this implies that there exists a bijective correspondence between one-dimensional foliations on (M4,c,D) , which are locally defined by harmonic morphisms, and certain almost CR-structures on the bundle of positive orthogonal complex structures on (M4,c) . Other similar results are given in Section 5 . In Section 6 , we also give the necessary and sufficient conditions for a map with one-dimensional fibres from a four-dimensional Weyl space endowed with the almost twistorial structure of Eells and Salamon to be twistorial (Theorem [\ref=thm:smoothtwistmap4'to3''] ). It follows that, all such twistorial maps are harmonic morphisms. Also, a generalized monopole equation (Definition [\ref=defn:pullbackmono](1) ) is naturally involved.

Harmonic morphisms

In this section all the manifolds and maps are assumed to be smooth. Let Mm be a manifold of dimension m . If m is even then we denote by L the line bundle associated to the frame bundle of Mm through the morphism of Lie groups [formula] , ρm(a) = | det a  |1 / m , [formula] ; obviously, L is oriented. If m is odd then we denote by L the line bundle associated to the frame bundle of Mm through the morphism of Lie groups [formula] , ρm(a) = ( det a)1 / m , [formula] ; obviously, [formula] is an oriented vector bundle. We say that L is the line bundle of Mm (cf. [\cite=Cal-sds] ). Similar considerations apply to any vector bundle. Let φ:M  →  N be a submersion and let [formula] be a distribution on M, complementary to the fibres of φ . Let [formula] and LN be the line bundles of [formula] and N, respectively. As [formula] and [formula], where n =  dim N, the differential of φ induces a bundle map Λ from [formula] to L  2N. If n is odd then we also have a bundle map λ from [formula] to LN ; obviously, Λ  =  λ2. Furthermore, if n is odd, [formula] and λ induce a bundle map from [formula] to [formula], which will also be denoted by [formula] ; note that, [formula] is orientation preserving, on each fibre. Let c be a conformal structure on M; that is, c is a section of [formula] which is 'positive-definite'; that is, for any positive section s2 of L2 we have [formula] , where gs is a Riemannian metric on M; then gs is a representative of c . Therefore, c corresponds to a Riemannian metric on the vector bundle [formula] (see [\cite=Cal-sds] ). Furthermore, c corresponds to an injective vector bundle morphism [formula] such that, at each x∈M, the positive bases of L2x are mapped into the cone of positive definite symmetric bilinear forms on T*xM. Obviously, c also corresponds to a reduction of the frame bundle of M to [formula] , where m =  dim M; the total space of the reduction corresponding to c is formed of the conformal frames on (M,c) . If dim M is odd then local sections of L correspond to oriented local representatives of c ; that is, (local) representatives of c , on some oriented open set of M. Let [formula] be a distribution on M. Then c induces a conformal structure [formula] on [formula] and, it follows that, we have an isomorphism, which depends of c , between L  2 and [formula] .

Let (M,cM) and (N,cN) be conformal manifolds. A map φ:(M,cM)  →  (N,cN) is horizontally weakly conformal if at each point x∈M, either [formula] or [formula] is a conformal linear isomorphism from [formula] onto [formula] .

Let (M,cM) and (N,cN) be conformal manifolds and let φ:(M,cM)  →  (N,cN) be a horizontally conformal submersion; denote by LM and LN the line bundles of M and N, respectively. Let [formula] and denote by [formula] its line bundle. As [formula] , the bundle map Λ defines an isomorphism from L  2M to φ*(L  2N) which is called the square dilation of φ . We have [formula] , where n =  dim N and c is the conformal structure on the bundle [formula] induced by cM , cN and φ . Therefore, if φ is horizontally weakly conformal then Λ extends to a (smooth) section of [formula] which is zero over the set of critical points of φ . If dim N is odd, the bundle map λ from [formula] to LN is called the oriented dilation of φ . Note that, [formula] is an orientation preserving isometry, on each fibre. Let (M,c) be a conformal manifold. A connection D on M is confomal if Dc = 0 ; equivalently, D is the covariant derivation of a principal connection on the bundle of conformal frames on (M,c) . If D is torsion-free then it is called a Weyl connection and (M,c,D) is a Weyl space.

(i) Let (M,c,D) be a Weyl space. A harmonic function, on (M,c,D) , is a function f, (locally) defined on M, such that [formula] . (ii) A map φ:(M,cM,DM)  →  (N,cN,DN) between Weyl spaces is a harmonic map if [formula] , where D is the connection on [formula] induced by DM, DN and φ . (iii) A map φ:(M,cM,DM)  →  (N,cN,DN) between Weyl spaces is a harmonic morphism if for any harmonic function [formula] , on (N,cN,DN) , with V an open set of N such that φ- 1(V) is nonempty, [formula] is a harmonic function, on (M,cM,DM) .

Obviously, any harmonic function is a harmonic map and a harmonic morphism, if [formula] is endowed with its conformal structure and canonical connection. The following result is basic for the theory of harmonic morphisms (see [\cite=LouPan] , [\cite=BaiWoo2] ).

A map between Weyl spaces is a harmonic morphism if and only if it is a harmonic map which is horizontally weakly conformal.

We end this section by recalling the fundamental equation for horizontally conformal submersions between Weyl spaces ( [\cite=LouPan] ; cf. [\cite=BaiWoo2] ).

Let φ:(Mm,cM,DM)  →  (Nn,cN,DN) be a horizontally conformal submersion between Weyl spaces; m =  dim M, n =  dim N. Let L be the line bundle of Mm and let [formula] , [formula] ; denote by D the Weyl connection of [formula] . Then we have the following equality of partial connections on Lm - n, over [formula], where we have denoted by the same symbol DN and its pull-back by φ .

Complex distributions

Unless otherwise stated, all the manifolds and maps are assumed to smooth.

A complex distribution on a manifold M is a complex subbundle [formula] of [formula] such that [formula] , (x∈M) , is constant. If [formula] is the zero bundle then [formula] is an almost CR-structure on M, and [formula] an almost CR-manifold.

Next, we define the notion of holomorphic map between manifolds endowed with complex distributions.

Let [formula] and [formula] be complex distributions on M and N, respectively. A map [formula] is holomorphic if [formula]. A map φ:(M,FM)  →  (N,FN) between manifolds endowed with f-structures is holomorphic if [formula] is holomorphic where [formula] and [formula] are the complex distributions, on M and N, associated to FM and FN, respectively.

Let F be an almost f-structure on M and J an almost complex structure on N. Then, a map φ:(M,F)  →  (N,J) is holomorphic if and only if [formula] .

Let M be a manifold. A subbundle E of [formula] is integrable if for any sections X, Y of E we have that

[formula]

Note that a complex distribution [formula] on M is integrable if and only if for any point x∈M, there exists a holomorphic submersion [formula] , from some open neighbourhood U of x, onto some CR-manifold [formula] , such that [formula] . If U = M and φ has connected fibres then [formula] is called simple; then, obviously, up to a CR-diffeomorphism, φ is unique; we call it the holomorphic submersion corresponding to [formula].

The following definition will, also, be useful in the next section.

Let (P,J) be a complex manifold and let Q  ⊆  P be a complex submanifold. A holomorphic distribution (on P) along Q is a holomorphic subbundle of (T1,0P)|Q . Let [formula] be a manifold endowed with an integrable complex distribution such that [formula]. Let N  ⊆  M be a submanifold on which [formula] induces a complex distribution. A complex subbundle E of [formula] is called a holomorphic distribution (on M) along N if, for any x∈N, there exists an open set U  ⊆  M, containing x , and a holomorphic submersion φ from [formula] onto some complex manifold (P,J) , with [formula] , such that [formula] is a holomorphic submersion from [formula] onto a complex submanifold of (P,J) and [formula] maps [formula], isomorphically on each fibre, onto a holomorphic distribution along [formula] (that is, onto a holomorphic subbundle of [formula] ); if N = M then we say that E is a holomorphic distribution on M.

Let F be a f-structure on a manifold M. Obviously, T1,0M is a holomorphic distribution on M.

Let E be a complex vector bundle over M endowed with a complex linear connection [formula] (that is, [formula] is a complex-linear map [formula] such that [formula] for any section s of E and any complex-valued function f on M; equivalently, we have [formula] , with respect to the decomposition [formula] ). Let π:Grk(E)  →  M be the bundle of complex vector subspaces of complex dimension k of E; we shall denote by [formula] the connection induced by [formula] on Grk(E) . Note that, as Grk(E) is a bundle whose typical fibre is a complex manifold and its structural group a complex Lie group acting holomorphically on the fibre, we have [formula] . The following result, which we do not imagine to be new, will be useful later on. We omit the proof.

Let p be a section of Grk(E) (equivalently, p is a complex vector subbundle of complex rank k of E ). Let [formula] for some x0∈M; denote by p0 = p(x0) . (a) The following assertions are equivalent:   [formula] .   [formula] for any section s of [formula]. (b) The following assertions are equivalent:   [formula].   [formula] for any section s of p.

Note that, if X is real (that is, X∈TM) then the assertions (i) ,  , (iv) , of Proposition [\ref=prop:autoparallel] , are equivalent.

Almost twistorial structures

In this section, we define, in the smooth category, the notion of (almost) twistorial structure.

An almost twistorial structure, on a manifold M, is a quadruple [formula] where π:P  →  M is a locally trivial fibre space and [formula] is a complex distribution on P which induces almost complex structures on each fibre of π ; if [formula] is induced by an almost f-structure F then, also, (P,M,π,F) is called an almost twistorial structure. The almost twistorial structure [formula] is integrable if [formula] is integrable. A twistorial structure is an integrable almost twistorial structure; the leaf space of [formula] is called the twistor space of τ. A twistorial structure [formula] is called simple if [formula] is simple; if τ is simple with [formula] the corresponding holomorphic submersion then [formula] is a CR-structure on Z.

Let [formula] be a twistorial structure and let Z be its twistor space. Each z∈Z determines a pair (Nz,Jz) where Nz is a submanifold of M, possibly, with self-intersections, and Jz is a linear CR-structure on the normal bundle of Nz. Indeed, let Nz  =  φ- 1(z) , where φ:P  →  Z is the (continuous) projection whose fibres are the leaves of [formula]. Then π|Nz:Nz  →  M is an immersion. Also, let [formula]. Then the restriction to Nz of the quotient of [formula] through [formula] defines a linear CR-structure Jz on the normal bundle (π|Nz)*(TM) / TNz of Nz in M.

Now, we formulate the examples of almost twistorial structures with which we shall work.

Let (M3,c) be a three-dimensional conformal manifold. Let π:P  →  M be the bundle of nonzero skew-adjoint f-structures on (M3,c) . Let D be a Weyl connection on (M3,c) and let [formula] be a conformal connection on (M3,c) . The following assertions are equivalent:  (i) [formula] and D induce, by applying the construction of Example [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr3] (with [formula] the connection on P induced by [formula] and D , respectively), the same almost f-structure on P.  (ii) [formula] and D are projectively equivalent.  (iii) There exists a section k of L* such that [formula] is the connection associated to D and k .

Next, we recall the necessary and sufficient conditions for the integrability of the almost twistorial structures of Examples [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr3] and [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr4] .

Let (M3,c,D) be a three-dimensional Weyl space and let k be a section of the dual of the line bundle of N3. Let τ = (P,M,π,F) be the almost twistorial structure of Example [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr3] . Let [formula] be the connection induced by [formula] on P. Then τ depends only of (M3,c,D) whilst T1,0P depends only of (M3,c) . Moreover, τ is integrable if and only if (M3,c,D) is Einstein-Weyl. Furthermore, if (M3,c,D) is Einstein-Weyl then we have the following.   [formula] restricted to any fibre [formula] of P is a holomorphic distribution, along Px , isomorphic to O(2) , (x∈M) .   Locally, the following four assertions are equivalent:    [formula] is a holomorphic distribution on P.    [formula] is integrable.    The connection induced by [formula] on [formula] is flat.    The scalar curvature sD of D satisfies [formula], and *  cDk = FD where FD is the curvature form of the connection induced by D on L .

Let (M4,c,D) be a four-dimensional oriented Weyl space and let τ = (P,M,π,J) be the almost twistorial structure of Example [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr4] . Let [formula] be the connection induced by D on P. Then τ depends only of (M4,c) . Moreover, τ is integrable if and only if (M4,c) is anti-self-dual. Furthermore, if (M4,c) is anti-self-dual then we have the following.   [formula] restricted to any fibre [formula] of P is a holomorphic distribution, along Px , isomorphic to [formula] , (x∈M) .   [formula] is a holomorphic distribution on P if and only if, locally, either D is the Levi-Civita connection of an Einstein representative of c or D is the Obata connection of a hyper-Hermitian structure on (M4,c) .

1) Let (M3,c,D) be a three-dimensional Weyl space and let k be a section of L*, where L is the line bundle of N3. Let T1,0P be defined as in Example [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr3] . Then by associating to any p∈P the eigenspace corresponding to -  i we can identify P with the bundle of null directions on (N3,c) . Furthermore, under this isomorphism, T1,0P corresponds to the CR-structure of Example [\ref=exm:nullgeodesics] , associated to (N3,c) . Conversely, any conformal connection on (N3,c) having this property is the connection associated to a Weyl connection on (N3,c) and a section of L*. 2) Let (M3,c) be a three-dimensional conformal manifold and let D be a Weyl connection on (M3,c) . Also, let k be a section of the dual of the line bundle L of M3. Then the almost twistorial structure τ' of Example [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr3'] , associated to (M3,c,D,k) is nonintegrable; that is, always not integrable (cf. [\cite=EelSal] ; apply the integrability result proved in [\cite=Pan-sp] to show that τ' is nonintegrable). Furthermore, if D1 is another Weyl connection on (M3,c) and k1 a section of L* such that the almost twistorial of Example [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr3'] , associated to (M3,c,D1,k1) , is equal to τ' then D = D1 and k = k1 . 3) Let (M4,c) be a four-dimensional oriented conformal manifold and let D be a Weyl connection on (M4,c) . Then the almost twistorial structure τ' of Example [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr4'] , associated to (M4,c,D) is nonintegrable (cf. [\cite=EelSal] ; apply the integrability result proved in [\cite=Pan-sp] to show that τ' is nonintegrable). Furthermore, if D1 is another Weyl connection on (M4,c) such that the almost twistorial structure of Example [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr4'] , associated to (M4,c,D1) , is equal to τ' then D = D1 .

Twistorial maps

We start this section with the definition of twistorial maps (cf. [\cite=Raw-ftwistor] , [\cite=PanWoo-sd] ).

Let [formula] and [formula] be almost twistorial structures and let φ:M  →  N be a map. Suppose that there exists a locally trivial fibre subspace πM,φ:PM,φ  →  M of πM:PM  →  M and a map [formula] with the properties: )  [formula] induces a complex distribution [formula] on PM,φ and almost complex structures on each fibre of πM,φ such that [formula], for any p∈PM,φ . )  [formula] . Then φ:(M,τM)  →  (N,τN) is a twistorial map (with respect to [formula]) if the map [formula] is holomorphic. If [formula] and [formula] are simple complex distributions, with [formula] and [formula], respectively, the corresponding holomorphic submersions onto CR-manifolds, then [formula] induces a holomorphic map Zφ:ZM,φ  →  ZN which is called the twistorial representation of φ .

With the same notations as in Definition [\ref=defn:smoothtwiststr] , we have that [formula] is an almost twistorial structure on M. Obviously, τM,φ is integrable if τM is integrable. Then from (1) it follows that the twistor space ZM,φ of τM,φ is a topological subspace of the twistor space ZM of τM. Moreover, for any z∈ZM,φ the pair (Nz,Jz) of Remark [\ref=rem:smoothtwiststr] applied to τM,φ is equal to the pair determined by z as a point of ZM. If τM is simple then τM,φ is also simple and ZM,φ is a submanifold of ZM. Moreover, if we denote by CM and CM,φ the CR-structures of ZM and ZM,φ , respectively, then [formula] .

Next, we give examples of twistorial maps between manifolds endowed with the almost twistorial structures of Examples [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr2] , [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr3] or [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr4] .

The following three examples are, essentially, due to [\cite=Hit-complexmfds] , [\cite=Raw-ftwistor].

Let φ:(M4,cM)  →  N3 be a submersion from a four-dimensional oriented conformal manifold to a three-dimensional manifold. Let L be the line bundle of N3. As the orientation of M4 corresponds to an isomorphism between [formula] and φ*(L) , the pull-back by φ of any section of L* is a (vertical) one-form on M4. Similarly, if E is a vector bundle over N3, the pull-back by φ of any section of [formula] is a φ*(E)-valued one-form on M4. Next, we recall the following definitions (see [\cite=PanWoo-sd] and the references therein).

Let P be a principal bundle on N3 endowed with a (principal) connection Γ and let A be a section of [formula] . 1) Let N3 be endowed with a conformal structure cN and a Weyl connection DN. The pair (A,Γ) is called a monopole on (N3,cN,DN) if

[formula]

where R is the curvature form of Γ and [formula] is (the covariant derivative of) the connection induced by Γ on AdP. 2) Let (M4,cM) be a four-dimensional oriented conformal manifold and let φ:M4  →  N3 be a submersion. The connection [formula] on φ*(P) defined by

[formula]

is called the pull-back by φ of (A,Γ) .

Next, we prove the following (cf. [\cite=PanWoo-sd] and the references therein):

Let (M4,cM) be a four-dimensional oriented conformal manifold and let (N3,cN,DN) be a three-dimensional Weyl space; denote by τM and τN the almost twistorial structures of Examples [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr4] and [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr3] , associated to (M4,cM) and (N3,cN,DN) , respectively. Let P be a principal bundle over N3 endowed with a connection Γ and let A be a nowhere zero section of [formula] . Also, let φ:(M4,cM)  →  (N3,cN) be a surjective horizontally conformal submersion with connected fibres. Then any two of the following assertions imply the third:   φ:(M4,τM)  →  (N3,τN) is twistorial.   (A,Γ) is a monopole on (N3,cN,DN) .   [formula] is anti-self-dual.

Let [formula] be the curvature form of [formula]. A straightforward calculation shows that, up to an anti-self-dual term, the following equality holds

[formula]

where we have used the isomorphism [formula] , induced by cM . The proof follows.

The fact that [\eqref=e:pullbackmono] holds, up to an anti-self-dual term, does not require φ be horizontally conformal; moreover, this relation characterizes [formula] among the partial connections on [formula], over [formula]. It follows that a submersion from a four-dimensional oriented conformal manifold to a three-dimensional Weyl space is twistorial, as in Example [\ref=exm:smoothtwistmap4to3] , if and only if it pulls-back any (local) monopole to an anti-self-dual connection; the 'only if' part is essentially due to [\cite=PanWoo-sd] whilst the 'if' part is an immediate consequence of Proposition [\ref=prop:pullbackmono] (see also [\cite=PanWoo-sd] and the references therein).

Twistorial maps and harmonic morphisms

We start this section by recalling, from [\cite=LouPan] , the relations between harmonic morphisms and the twistorial maps of Examples [\ref=exm:smoothtwistmap2to2] , [\ref=exm:smoothtwistmap3to2] , [\ref=exm:smoothtwistmap4to2] and [\ref=exm:smoothtwistmap4to3] . Firstly, any map between two-dimensional orientable conformal manifolds is a harmonic morphism if and only if, with respect to suitable orientations, it is a twistorial map.

Let (Mm,cM,DM) and (Nn,cN,DN) be Weyl spaces of dimensions m and n , respectively, where (m,n)∈{(3,2),(4,2),(4,3)} . If m (n) is even then Mm (Nn) is assumed to be oriented. Endow Mm and Nn, according to their dimensions, with the almost twistorial structures τM and τN, respectively, of Examples [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr2] , [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr3] or [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr4] . Let φ:Mm  →  Nn be a submersion. (i) If (m,n) = (3,2) then the following assertions are equivalent:   φ:(M3,cN,DN)  →  (N2,cN,DN) is a harmonic morphism.   φ:(M3,τM)  →  (N2,τN) is a twistorial map. (ii) If (m,n) = (4,2) then the following assertions are equivalent:   φ:(M4,cN,DN)  →  (N2,cN,DN) is a harmonic morphism and φ:(M4,τM)  →  (N2,τN) is a twistorial map.   φ:(M4,cM)  →  (N2,cN) is horizontally conformal and the fibres of [formula] are tangent to the connection induced by DM on PM. (iii) If (m,n) = (4,3) then any two of the following assertions imply the third:   φ:(M4,cN,DN)  →  (N3,cN,DN) is a harmonic morphism.   φ:(M4,τM)  →  (N3,τN) is a twistorial map.   The fibres of [formula] are tangent to the connection induced by DM on PM.

Next we discuss twistorial maps between manifolds endowed with the almost twistorial structures of Examples [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr2] , [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr3'] or [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr4'] . The notations are as in Section [\ref=twistmaps] . The following proposition is essentially due to [\cite=EelSal] ; its proof is similar to the proofs of Propositions [\ref=prop:smoothtwistmap3'to2] and [\ref=prop:smoothtwistmap4'to2] .

Let (Mm,c,D) be a Weyl space, m = 3,4 , and let k be a section of the dual of the line bundle of Mm; if m = 4 assume M4 oriented and k = 0 . Let τM' be the almost twistorial structure on Mm given by Examples [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr3'] or [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr4'] according to m = 3 or m = 4 , respectively. Let N2 be an oriented surface in Mm. Let τN be the twistorial structure of Example [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr4] , associated to (N2,c|N) . The following assertions are equivalent:   (N2,τN)  →  (Mm,τM') is twistorial (with respect to pN).   N2 is a minimal surface in (Mm,c,D) and k|N = 0 .

Let φ:(M3,c)  →  N2 be a submersion from a three-dimensional conformal manifold to an oriented two-dimensional manifold. Let [formula] and [formula]. From the fact that N2 is oriented it follows that c induces an isomorphism between [formula] and the line bundle of M3 . Let [formula] be the second fundamental form of [formula] , with respect to D , and let [formula] be the integrability tensor of [formula] . We shall denote by [formula] the Hodge star operator of [formula] .

Let (M3,cM,D) be a three-dimensional Weyl space and let k be a section of the dual of the line bundle of M3. Let τM' be the almost twistorial structure of Example [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr3'] , associated to (M3,cM,D,k) ; denote by [formula] the connection associated to D and k . Let (N2,cN) be a two-dimensional oriented conformal manifold. Let τN be the twistorial structure of Example [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr2] , associated to (N2,cN) . Let φ:M3  →  N2 be a submersion. The following assertions are equivalent:   φ:(M3,τM')  →  (N2,τN) is a twistorial map.   φ:(M3,cM)  →  (N2,cN) is horizontally conformal, D is the Weyl connection of [formula] and [formula] .   φ:(M3,cM,D)  →  (N2,cN) is a harmonic morphism, [formula] and [formula] .   φ:(M3,cM)  →  (N2,cN) is a horizontally conformal submersion and [formula] , [formula] .

Let pφ be the section of P corresponding to Fφ where τM' = (P,M,π,F') (see Example [\ref=exm:smoothtwistmap3to2] ). Then condition (1) of Definition [\ref=defn:smoothtwistmap] is satisfied by φ , with respect to [formula] , if and only if [formula] , for all x∈M, where [formula] is the direct sum of the eigenbundles of F' corresponding to 0 and -  i . Equivalently, condition (1) of Definition [\ref=defn:smoothtwistmap] is satisfied by φ , with respect to [formula] , if and only if pφ:(M3,Fφ)  →  (P5,F') is holomorphic. It follows that assertion (i) holds if and only if pφ:(M3,Fφ)  →  (P5,F') and φ:(M3,Fφ)  →  (N2,JN) are holomorphic where JN is the positive Hermitian structure on (N2,cN) . The latter condition is equivalent to φ:(M3,cM)  →  (N2,cN) horizontally conformal. We can find local representatives [formula] of cM such that U and Y (locally) generate the eigenbundles of Fφ corresponding to 0 and -  i , respectively; in particular, [formula] . Hence, under the identification of P with the bundle of two-dimensional degenerate spaces on (M3,cM) , the section pφ corresponds to the distribution (locally) generated by U and Y. From Proposition [\ref=prop:autoparallel] it follows that pφ:(M3,Fφ)  →  (P5,F') is holomorphic if and only if g(DUU,Y) = 0 and [formula] . Thus, after a straightforward calculation we obtain that pφ:(M,Fφ)  →  (P,F'  ) is holomorphic if and only if [formula] , [formula] and the fibres of φ are geodesics of D . Thus, we have proved that (i)[formula](ii)[formula](iii) . Also, if φ:(M3,cM)  →  (N2,cN) is horizontally conformal then we have [formula] if and only if [formula] and the fibres of φ are geodesics of D . Hence, (iii)[formula](iv) .

Also, we have the following result.

Let (M4,cM,D) be a four-dimensional oriented Weyl space. Let τM' be the almost twistorial structure of Example [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr4'] , associated to (M4,cM,D) . Let (N2,cN) be a two-dimensional oriented conformal manifold. Let τN be the twistorial structure of Example [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr2] , associated to (N2,cN) . Let φ:M4  →  N2 be a submersion. The following assertions are equivalent:   φ:(M4,τM')  →  (N2,τN) is a twistorial map.   φ:(M4,cM)  →  (N2,cN) is horizontally conformal and D is the Weyl connection of (M4,cM,Jφ).   φ:(M4,cM,D)  →  (N2,cN) is a harmonic morphism and we have [formula] .

Let pφ be the section of P corresponding to Jφ where τM' = (P,M,π,J') (see Example [\ref=exm:smoothtwistmap4to2] ). Similarly to the proof of Proposition [\ref=prop:smoothtwistmap4'to2] , assertion (i) holds if and only if pφ:(M4,Jφ)  →  (P6,J') is holomorphic and φ:(M4,cM)  →  (N2,cN) is horizontally conformal. It follows that (i)[formula](ii) . We can find local representatives [formula] of cM such that U and Y (locally) generate the eigenbundle of Jφ corresponding -  i and such that U and [formula] are vertical. Hence, under the identification of P with the bundle of self-dual spaces on (M4,cM) , the section pφ corresponds to the distribution (locally) generated by U and Y. From Proposition [\ref=prop:autoparallel] it follows that pφ:(M4,Jφ)  →  (P6,J') is holomorphic if and only if [formula] and [formula] . Now, [formula] if and only if the fibres of φ are minimal with respect to D whilst [formula] if and only if [formula] . Hence, (i)[formula](iii) .

Harmonic morphisms and twistorial maps between Weyl spaces of dimensions four and three

We start this section by introducing a generalization of the almost twistorial structure of Example [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr3'] .

The results of Section [\ref=section:twistmapsharmorphs] , which involve the almost twistorial structure of Example [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr3'] , can be easily generalized by working, instead, with the almost twistorial structure of Example [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr3''] . In Theorem [\ref=thm:smoothtwistmap4'to3''] , below, we shall see that this generalization is significant when working with maps between Weyl spaces of dimensions four and three. We shall also need the following.

Let (N3,cN) be a three-dimensional conformal manifold. At least locally, we may assume that [formula] is the adjoint bundle of a rank two complex vector bundle E with group SU(2) . Furthermore, under this identification, PN is isomorphic to PE . As [formula] , any connection on [formula] corresponds to a connection on the PSU(2)-bundle PN. Also, [formula] is the adjoint bundle of the PSU(2)-bundle PN. Similarly, if (M4,cM) is a four-dimensional oriented conformal manifold then the bundle PM of positive orthogonal complex structures on (M4,cM) is a PSU(2)-bundle. Furthermore, a submersion φ:(M4,cM)  →  (N3,cN) is horizontally conformal if and only if [formula] is a morphism of PSU(2)-bundles (in general, [formula] is a morphism of [formula]-bundles). Also, note that, if φ is horizontally conformal then PM  =  φ*(PN) as PSU(2)-bundles.

The following result shows the importance of the almost twistorial structures of Example [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr4'phi] .

Let (M4,cM,DM) be a four-dimensional oriented Weyl space and let PM be the bundle of positive orthogonal complex structures on (M4,cM) . Let (N3,cN,DN) be a three-dimensional Weyl space and let k be a section of the dual of the line bundle of N3; denote by [formula] the connection associated to DN and k . Let τN' be the almost twistorial structure of Example [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr3'] , associated to (N3,cN,DN,k) . Let φ:M4  →  N3 be a submersion; denote by [formula] and [formula]. Let τφ' and τφ'' be the almost twistorial structures of Example [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr4'phi] , associated to (M4,cM,DM) and φ . (i) The following assertions are equivalent:   φ:(M4,τφ')  →  (N3,τN') is twistorial.   φ:(M4,cM,DM)  →  (N3,cN,DN) is a harmonic morphism. (ii) The following assertions are equivalent:   φ:(M4,τφ'')  →  (N3,τN') is twistorial.   φ:(M4,cM)  →  (N3,cN) is horizontally conformal, [formula] and [formula] as partial connections, over [formula], where D is the Weyl connection of [formula] .   φ:(M4,cM)  →  (N3,cN) is horizontally conformal and the partial connections on PM, over [formula], induced by DM and [formula] are equal.

(i) By Remark [\ref=rem:horconf4to3] , if (i1) holds then φ:(M4,cM)  →  (N3,cN) is horizontally conformal. Let [formula] and let τ'N = (PN,N,πN,F') . By associating to each orthogonal complex structure on (M4,cM) its eigenspace corresponding to -  i , we identify πM:PM  →  M with the bundle of self-dual spaces on (M4,cM) . Similarly, by associating to each skew-adjoint f-structure on (N3,cN) the sum of its eigenspaces corresponding to 0 and -  i , we identify πN:PN  →  N with the bundle of (complex) two-dimensional degenerate spaces on (N3,cN) . Under this identifications the natural lift [formula] of φ is given by [formula] , for any p∈PM . Let q be a local section of PN , over some open set V  ⊆  N, and let p be the local section of PM , over φ- 1(V) , such that [formula] . At least locally, we may assume that p is generated by Y = U + iX and Z, with U vertical, and X and Z basic. Thus, q is generated by [formula] and [formula] . We shall assume that, for some x0∈φ- 1(V) , we have [formula] horizontal, with respect to the connection induced by [formula] on PN . Then Proposition [\ref=prop:autoparallel] , the fundamental equation and a straightforward calculation show that [formula] if and only if [formula] , where [formula] is the connection induced by DM and DN on [formula]. This proves that (i2)[formula](i1) . To prove the converse, assume that (i1) holds. Then there exists a unique [formula] such that [formula] . From the fact that [formula] is the line spanned by [formula] , it follows quickly that [formula] . Together with [formula] this gives [formula] . Hence, [formula] and, therefore, [formula] . (ii) By Remark [\ref=rem:horconf4to3] , if (ii1) holds then φ:(M4,cM)  →  (N3,cN) is horizontally conformal. Similarly to above, let p be a basic local section of PM ; that is, there exists a local section q of PN such that [formula] . At least locally, we may assume that p is generated by Y = U + iX and Z, with U vertical, and X and Z basic. Thus, q is generated by [formula] and [formula] . To prove (ii1)[formula](ii2) , we shall asume that p is horizontal, at some point x0∈M, with respect to the connection induced by DM on PM (this could be done as follows: firstly, define p over some hypersurface, containing x0 and which is transversal to the fibres of φ , such that p to be horizontal at x0 ; then, extend p , to an open neighbourhood of x0 , so that to be basic); in particular, [formula] . Assertion (ii1) is equivalent to the fact that, for any such p , we have [formula] is contained in the eigenbundle of F' corresponding to the eigenvalue i . By using Proposition [\ref=prop:autoparallel] , it quickly follows that (ii1)[formula](ii2) . Let h be an oriented representative of cN and let g be a representative of cM such that φ:(M4,g)  →  (N3,h) is a Riemannian submersion. Let αM and αN be the Lee forms of DM and DN with respect to g and h , respectively. The equivalence (ii2)[formula](ii3) follows from the fact that any two of the following assertions imply the third:  (a) [formula] is horizontal, with respect to the connection induced by DM on PM .  (b) q is horizontal at φ(x0) , with respect to the connection induced by [formula] on PN .  (c) At x0 we have [formula] and [formula] , where we have identified k and αN with their pull-backs by φ and, in the first equality, we have used the isomorphism between [formula] and the pull-back by φ of the line bundle of N3 induced by φ and the orientation of M4. The proof is complete.

Let (M4,c,D) be a four-dimensional oriented Weyl spaces and let P be the bundle of positive orthogonal complex structures on (M4,c) . With the same notations as in Example [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr4'phi] , by Theorem [\ref=thm:smoothtwistmap4'phi3'](i) , the relation [formula] induces a bijective correspondence between one-dimensional foliations on (M4,c,D) , which are locally defined by harmonic morphisms, and certain almost CR-structures on P.

Next, we prove the following.

Let (M4,cM,DM) be a four-dimensional oriented Weyl space and let τM' be the almost twistorial structure of Example [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr4'] , associated to (M4,cM,DM) . Let (N3,cN) be a three-dimensional conformal manifold endowed with two Weyl connections D' and D''. Let k be a section of the dual of the line bundle of N3 and let τN'' be the almost twistorial structure of Example [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr3''] , associated to (N3,cN,D',D'',k) . Let φ:M4  →  N3 be a submersion. The following assertions are equivalent:   φ:(M4,τM')  →  (N3,τN'') is twistorial.   φ:(M4,cM)  →  (N3,cN) is horizontally conformal and the connection induced by DM on the bundle of positive orthogonal complex structures on (M4,cM) is the pull-back by φ of [formula] , where [formula] and [formula] is the connection associated to D'' and k .   The following assertions hold:    φ:(M4,cM,DM)  →  (N3,cN,D') is a harmonic morphism;    φ:(M4,τM)  →  (N3,τN) is twistorial, where τM and τN are the almost twistorial structures of Examples [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr4] and [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr3] , associated to (M4,cM) and (N3,cN,2D'' - D') , respectively.    [formula] where [formula] and D is the Weyl connection of [formula] .

From Theorem [\ref=thm:smoothtwistmap4'phi3'] , it follows that assertion (i) holds if and only if φ:(M4,cM,DM)  →  (N3,cN,D') is a harmonic morphism, [formula] and [formula] as partial connections, over [formula] . Together with the fundamental equation, this quickly gives (i)[formula](iii) . Let τ'M = (PM,M,πM,J') . From Theorem [\ref=thm:smoothtwistmap4'phi3'] , it follows that assertion (i) holds if and only if φ:(M4,cM)  →  (N3,cN) is horizontally conformal, the partial connections on PM, over [formula], induced by DM and [formula] are equal, and we have [formula], as partial connections, over [formula]. Let [formula] be a positive conformal local frame on (M4,cM) such that X1 is vertical and X2 , X3 , X4 are basic. Let g be the local representative of cM induced by [formula] . Let αM and α be the Lee forms, with respect to g , of DM and D , respectively. Denote by Γijk , [formula] , the Christoffel symbols of DM with respect to [formula] . Then a straightforward calculation gives the following relations: Thus, we have proved that (i) holds if and only if φ:(M4,cM)  →  (N3,cN) is horizontally conformal, the partial connections on PM, over [formula], induced by DM and [formula] are equal, and the following relations hold: It follows that (i)[formula](ii) .

1) Let (M4,cM,DM) be a four-dimensional oriented Weyl space. Let τM' be the almost twistorial structure of Example [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr4'] , associated to (M4,cM,DM) ; denote by PM be the bundle of positive orthogonal complex structures on (M4,cM) . Let φ:M4  →  N3 be a submersion onto a three-dimensional manifold. Let PN be the bundle of oriented lines on N3. Then, similar to Example [\ref=exm:smoothtwistmap4to3] , there can be defined a bundle map [formula]. Suppose that there exists an almost twistorial structure τ on N3 such that φ:(M4,τM')  →  (N3,τ) is a twistorial map, with respect to [formula]. Then there exists a section k of the dual of the line bundle of N3, a conformal structure cN on N3 and Weyl connections D' and D'' on (N3,cN) such that τ is the almost twistorial structure of Example [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr3''] , associated to (N3,cN,D',D'',k) . Similar comments apply to all of the previous examples of submersive twistorial maps. 2) Let (M4,cM) be an oriented four-dimensional conformal manifold and let (N3,cN,D) be a three-dimensional Weyl space. Denote by τM and τN the almost twistorial structures, of Examples [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr4] and [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr3] , associated to (M4,cM) and (N3,cN,D) , respectively. Let φ:(M4,τM)  →  (N3,τN) be a twistorial map (see [\cite=PanWoo-sd] and [\cite=Cal-sds] for examples of such maps). Let D' be a Weyl connection on (N3,cN) and let k be a section of the dual of the line bundle of N3; denote by [formula] . From Theorem [\ref=thm:smoothtwistmap4'to3''] , it follows that there exists a unique Weyl connection DM on (M4,cM) such that φ:(M4,τM')  →  (N3,τN'') is twistorial, where τM' and τN'' are the almost twistorial structures, of Examples [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr4'] and [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr3''] , associated to (M4,cM,DM) and (N3,cN,D',D'',k) , respectively. 3) Let (M4,cM) be a four-dimensional oriented conformal manifold and let L be the line bundle of M4. Denote by P± the bundles of positive/negative orthogonal complex structures on (M4,cM) . As P± are, locally, the projectivisations of the bundles of positive/negative spinors on [formula] , any conformal connection on (M4,cM) corresponds to a pair (Γ+,Γ-) , where Γ± are connections on P± . Let φ:(M4,cM)  →  (N3,cN) be a horizontally conformal submersion onto a three-dimensional conformal manifold. Endow (N3,cN) with two Weyl connections D' and D'' and let k be a section of the dual of the line bundle of N3. Let Γ+ be the connection on P+ which is the pull-back by φ of [formula] , where [formula] and [formula] is the connection associated to D'' and k . Let Γ- be a connection on P- and suppose that the connection DM corresponding to (Γ+,Γ-) is torsion-free. Then, obviously, DM is a Weyl connection on (M4,cM) . Moreover, by Theorem [\ref=thm:smoothtwistmap4'to3''] , the map φ:(M4,τM')  →  (N3,τN'') is twistorial, where τM' and τN'' are the almost twistorial structures, of Examples [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr4'] and [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr3''] , associated to (M4,cM,DM) and (N3,cN,D',D'',k) , respectively. 4) With the same notations as in Theorem [\ref=thm:smoothtwistmap4'to3''] , it can be proved that [formula] is a monopole on (N3,cN,2D'' - D') if and only if D' = D'' and [formula] is flat (cf. [\cite=GauTod] ; see [\cite=LouPan] for details about the resulting maps).

The following result is an immediate consequence of Theorem [\ref=thm:smoothtwistmap4'to3''] ; note that, the equivalence (ii)[formula](iii) appears in [\cite=LouPan] .

Let (M4,cM,DM) be a four-dimensional oriented Weyl space and let τM' be the almost twistorial structure of Example [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr4'] , associated to (M4,cM,DM) . Let (N3,cN,DN) be a three-dimensional Weyl space and let k be a section of the dual of the line bundle of N3. Let τN' be the almost twistorial structure of Example [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr3'] , associated to (N3,cN,DN,k) . Let φ:M4  →  N3 be a submersion. The following assertions are equivalent:   φ:(M4,τM')  →  (N3,τN') is twistorial.   φ:(M4,cM)  →  (N3,cN) is horizontally conformal and the connection induced by DM on the bundle of positive orthogonal complex structures on (M4,cM) is the pull-back by φ of [formula], where [formula] is the connection associated to DN and k .   The following assertions hold:    φ:(M4,cM,DM)  →  (N3,cN,DN) is a harmonic morphism;    φ:(M4,τM)  →  (N3,τN) is twistorial, where τM and τN are the almost twistorial structure of Examples [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr4] and [\ref=exm:smoothtwiststr3] , associated to (M4,cM) and (N3,cN,DN) , respectively.    [formula] where [formula] and D is the Weyl connection of [formula] .
