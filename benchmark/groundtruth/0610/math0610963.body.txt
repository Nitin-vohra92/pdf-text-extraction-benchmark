A remark on the non-rationality Problem for generic cubic fourfolds

Before to formulate the main statement of the present note, recall some definitions and statements related to Hodge structures.

Let H  =  {M,Hp,n - p,Q} be a polarized Hodge structure of weight n, that is, M is a free [formula]-module, [formula] is a non-degenerate bilinear form, the vector space [formula] is the direct sum of its complex subspaces Hp,n - p for some [formula], a  ≤  b, such that [formula] and

[formula]

A polarized Hodge structure H  =  {M,Hp,q,Q} is called unimodular if Q is an unimodular bilinear form, that is, if (ei) is a free basis of M, then the determinant of the matrix A = (Q(ei,ej)) is equal to ±  1. Let H1  =  {M1,Hp,q1,Q1} and H2  =  {M2,Hp,q2,Q2} be two polarized Hodge structures of weight n. A [formula]-homomorphism f:M1  →  M2 of [formula]-modules is a morphism of polarized Hodge structures if Q2(f(u),f(v)) = Q1(u,v) for all u,v∈M1 and f induces a morphism of Hodge structures, that is, [formula] for all p,q, where [formula]. Note that if f:M1  →  M2 is a morphism of polarized Hodge structures, then f is an embedding, since Q1 and Q2 are non-degenerate bilinear forms. We say that H1 is a polarized Hodge substructure of H2 (and will write H1  ⊂  H2) if the embedding M1  ⊂  M2 is a morphism of polarized Hodge structures. A polarized Hodge structure [formula] is called the direct sum of polarized Hodge structures H1 and H2 if the canonical embeddings [formula] are morphisms of polarized Hodge structures for i = 1,2. In the case of the direct sum we have [formula] for all p,q. We say that a polarized Hodge structure H is non-decomposable if it is not isomorphic to the direct sum of two non-trivial polarized Hodge structures.

Let X be a smooth projective manifold defined over the field [formula], [formula]. It is well known that one can associate to X a polarized Hodge structure HX  =  {MX,Hp,q,Q} of weight n, where

[formula]

[formula] are the spaces of harmonic (p,q)-forms on X, and Q = QX is the restriction to [formula] of the bilinear form

[formula]

It is well known that the lattice (MX,QX) is unimodular. Denote by hp,q = hp,q(X) =  dim Hp,qX  =   dim Hq(X,ΩpX) the Hodge numbers of X, where ΩpX is the sheaf of holomorphic p-forms on X.

Let f:X  →  V be a bi-rational morphism of smooth projective manifolds, [formula]. Then the polarized Hodge structure HX is decomposed in the direct sum of the polarized Hodge structure f*(HV)≃HV and a polarized Hodge structure [formula].

This statement is well-known in the particular case if f = σ:X  →  V is the monoidal transformation with non-singular center C  ⊂  V ([\cite=A], [\cite=D], [\cite=K]; see also [\cite=C-G]). By induction, the correctness of lemma follows for a composition [formula] of monoidal transformations σi:Xi  →  Xi - 1 with non-singular centers [formula], where X0 = V and Xm = Y.

Now, let f be an arbitrary bi-rational morphism. Since deg f = 1, then

[formula]

that is, f* is an embedding of the lattice [formula] in the lattice [formula]. Therefore f*:HV  →  HX is an embedding of the polarized Hodge structure. Since the lattices f*(MV) and MX are unimodular, there is a sublattice [formula] of MX such that [formula] is the direct sum of lattices.

Let us show that this decomposition in the direct sum of lattices induces a decomposition [formula] in the direct sum of polarized Hodge structures. For this, since the image of Hodge structure under a morphism of Hodge structures is a Hodge structure, it suffices to show that the natural projection [formula] is a morphism of Hodge structures. To show that [formula] is a morphism of Hodge structures, let us consider the bi-rational map [formula]. By Hironaka Theorem, there is a composition [formula] of monoidal transformations σi:Yi  →  Yi - 1 with non-singular centers [formula], where Y0 = V and Ym = Y, such that [formula] is a bi-rational morphism. We obtain a decomposition

[formula]

in the direct sum of polarized Hodge structures, where [formula] is the contribution in HY of the monoidal transformation σi + 1. Note that the natural projection [formula] is a morphism of polarized Hodge structures.

It follows from the commutative diagram

that g*:HX  →  HY is an embedding of polarized Hodge structures, such that g*(f*(HV)) = σ*(HV) and [formula]. Therefore we can identify HX with its image g*(HX), f*(HV) with σ*(HV), and [formula] with [formula]. Under this identification, the projection [formula] is identified with the restriction of [formula] to g*(HX). Therefore [formula] is a morphism of Hodge structures as the composition of two morphisms of Hodge structures: namely, of the embedding g* and the projection [formula].

Let [formula]. Believing in Hodge Conjecture, the elements of [formula] will be called algebraic and the module [formula] will be called the module of transcendental n-cycles on X, n = 2k. It is easy to see that the polarized Hodge structure HX induces a polarized Hodge structure TX  =  {TX,Hp,qT,QT}, where [formula] and QT is the restriction of Q to TX.

If S is a smooth projective surface, then the form Q = QS is symmetric unimodular and, by Index Theorem, its signature is equal to (2h2,0 + 1,h1,1 - 1). Note that the polarized Hodge structure TS on the transcendental cycles on a smooth projective surface S is a bi-rational invariant of the surface S. Non-decomposability Conjecture. The polarized Hodge structure TS on the transcendental cycles on a smooth projective surface S is non-decomposable.

Let [formula] be a smooth cubic fourfold. It is known (see [\cite=T1] and [\cite=T2]) that the moduli space of cubic fourfolds contains several families of rational cubics. Nevertheless, the following conjecture is well known. Non-rationality Conjecture. A generic cubic fourfold is non-rational.

The aim of the present note is to show that Non-rationality Conjecture follows from Non-decomposability Conjecture. To formulate the precise statement, we fix one of smooth cubic fourfolds V0. For each cubic fourfold V we can identify the lattice (MV,QV) with the lattice (M0,Q), where [formula] and Q = QV0. Let λ = L2∈M0, where [formula] is the class of the hyperplane section of [formula]. It is well known (see, for example, [\cite=K-K]) that each smooth cubic fourfold V has the following Hodge numbers: h4,0 = h0,4 = 0, h3,1 = h1,3 = 1, and h2,2 = 21. Consider the polarized Hodge structures HV  =  {MV,Hp,q,QV} on the fourth cohomology groups of the smooth cubic fourfolds V. Since h4,0 = 0 and h3,1 = 1, the polarized Hodge structure HV  =  {M0,Hp,qV,Q} is defined by a non-zero element [formula]. It follows from Hodge - Riemann bilinear relations that Q(λ,ω) = Q(ω,ω) = 0 and [formula]. Therefore the classifying space D of polarized Hodge structures of the smooth cubic fourfolds coincides with

[formula]

The point ω(V)∈D, corresponding to the polarized Hodge structure HV  =  {M0,Hp,q(V),Q} of a smooth cubic fourfold V, is called the periods of V. By [\cite=G] and by Global Torelli Theorem proved in [\cite=V], the set D0 of periods of the smooth cubic fourfolds is an open subset of D.

Let P = {μ∈M0  |Q(λ,μ) = 0} be the submodule of M0 consisting of the primitive elements. For each endomorphism [formula] such that A(P)  ⊂  P and the restriction A|P of A to P is not proportional to the identity automorphism of P, denote by

[formula]

Obviously, EA is the intersection of D and a finite number of linear subspaces of [formula] of codimension at least 2. Therefore EA is a proper closed analytic subvariety of D. Put [formula], then E is the union of countably many proper closed analytic subvarieties of D. Therefore [formula] is everywhere dense in D.

For each μ∈M0, μ is not proportional to λ, we put

[formula]

and [formula]. Similarly to above, B is the union of countably many proper closed analytic subvarieties of D. Therefore [formula] is also everywhere dense in D0.

If Non-decomposability Conjecture is true, then a smooth cubic fourfold V is non-rational if its periods [formula].

Assume that a smooth cubic fourfold V is rational and its periods [formula].

Note that the sublattice of transcendental elements TV of the lattice MV coincides with the sublattice of primitive elements P if the periods [formula].

Since V is rational, then there is a bi-rational map [formula]. By Hironaka Theorem, there is a composition [formula] of monoidal transformations τi:Xi  →  Xi - 1 with non-singular centers Ci - 1  ⊂  Xi - 1, where [formula] and Xn = X, such that [formula] is a bi-rational morphism.

Each τi induces an inclusion of unimodular polarized Hodge structures [formula] such that [formula]. In particular,

[formula]

Moreover, if dim Ci - 1  ≤  1, then [formula], and if Ci - 1 is a smooth surface, then [formula], where

[formula]

and Hp,qi - 1 = Hp - 1,q - 1Ci - 1. Therefore [formula], H4,0Xi = 0, and QXi(u,v) = 0 for [formula], [formula].

As a consequence, we obtain a decomposition of the unimodular polarized Hodge structure

[formula]

in the direct sum of polarized Hodge structures, where Hi is the contribution in HX of the (i + 1)th monoidal transformation. By induction, we have [formula] and, consequently,

[formula]

where the sum is taken over all surfaces Ci with pg  ≥  1, since [formula], [formula], and [formula] if the geometric genus pg of the surface Ci is equal to zero.

The morphism f induces a morphism of Hodge structures f*:HV  →  HX. By Lemma 1, the Hodge structure HX is decomposed in the direct sum [formula] of the polarized Hodge structures.

Let V be a smooth cubic fourfold from Proposition 1 and let [formula] and [formula] be morphisms described above. Then there is i0 such that the polarized Hodge structure TCi0 on the transcendental cycles of the surface Ci0 is decomposed in the direct sum of polarized Hodge structures [formula] and [formula].

We have two decompositions

[formula]

of the polarized Hodge structure HX. Consider a non-zero element ω∈f*(H3,1V). It can be represented in the form

[formula]

where ωi∈H3,1i. Let i0 be an index such that ωi0  ≠  0. Put [formula] and let [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula] be the natural projections. Note that all these projections are defined over [formula]. We have [formula] for some [formula], since dim f*(H3,1V) = 1 and [formula], [formula] are morphisms of Hodge structures.

Let us show that a = 1. Indeed, the restriction of [formula] to f*(MV)≃MV induces an endomorphism of MV such that

[formula]

since [formula] is a morphism of Hodge structures, [formula] and P = TV by assumption. Therefore [formula], since [formula] (that is, ω is an eigenvector of [formula] and a is its eigenvalue) and, by assumption, [formula]. Therefore [formula], since [formula] is an endomorphism of [formula]-module f*(P)≃P. Let [formula]. Then we have

[formula]

By Hodge - Riemann bilinear relations, [formula] for γ∈H3,1X and [formula] if and only if γ = 0. Therefore, without loss of generality, we can assume that [formula] and [formula]. We have [formula] and, consequently, a and b can not simultaneously be equal to zero, since ωi0  ≠  0. Besides, we have

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

that is, a2 - a - b = 0, and hence

[formula]

But, [formula] and [formula], therefore b = 0, a = 1 and hence [formula], since [formula]. Therefore, ω∈H3,1i0. Besides, we showed that [formula].

Let us show that f*(TV)  ⊂  Ti0. As above, we have two decompositions

[formula]

of the polarized Hodge structure TX. Each γ∈f*(TV) can be written in the form [formula], where [formula] and [formula]. Then, since [formula] and P = TV, we have

[formula]

where [formula]. Denote by [formula] the natural projection. Then, by definition of transcendental cycles, p(3,1)(γ)  ≠  0 for each non-zero element γ∈TX, since the Hodge number h4,0(X) = 0. In particular, p(3,1)(γ) = aγω for some [formula], aγ  ≠  0, since [formula]. Therefore p(3,1)(γi0) = aγω, since ω∈f*(H3,1V)  ⊂  H3,1i0, and hence [formula]. From this, we have [formula], that is, f*(TV)  ⊂  Ti0.

As a consequence, we obtain that

[formula]

is the direct sum of polarized Hodge structures, where [formula] is a polarized Hodge substructure of [formula]. To complete the proof of Lemma 2, recall that Ti0≃  -  TCi0( - 1), where TCi0 is the polarized Hodge structure on the transcendental 2-cycles on the smooth projective surface Ci0.

There does not exist a smooth projective surface S such that TV≃  -  TS( - 1), where V is a smooth cubic fourfold whose periods [formula].

If TV≃  -  TS( - 1) for some surface S, then its geometric genus pg = h2,0(S) = h3,1(V) = 1 and [formula]. Since pg = 1, the surface S is not a ruled surface. Note that the lattice TS is a bi-rational invariant. Therefore we can assume that S is a minimal model and its second Betti number b2(S) = h1,1(S) + 2h2,0(S)  ≥  23, since [formula] and S should have also algebraic 2-cycles. Therefore h1,1(S) should be greater than 20, since h2,0(S) = 1.

On the other hand, it follows from the classification of algebraic surfaces that K2S  ≥  0, where KS is the canonical class of S. Denote by χ(S) = 1 - h1,0(S) + h2,0(S) the algebraic Euler characteristic of the surface S and by e(S) = 2 + h1,1S + 2h2,0(S) - 4h1,0(S) its topological Euler characteristic. Note that h1,0(S) =  dim H0(S,Ω1S)  ≥  0. By Noether formula, we have [formula] and hence

[formula]

since h2,0(S) = 1. Therefore h1,1(S)  ≤  20.

It follows from Lemma 3 that in decomposition ([\ref=decomp]), the summand [formula] is non-trivial which contradicts Non-decomposability Conjecture.
