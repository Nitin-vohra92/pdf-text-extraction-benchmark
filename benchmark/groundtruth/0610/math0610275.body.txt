On exponentially coprime integers

Mathematics Subject Classification (2000): 11A05, 11A25, 11N37

1. Introduction

Let n > 1 be an integer of canonical form [formula]. The integer d is called an exponential divisor of n if [formula], where ci|ai for every 1  ≤  i  ≤  r, notation: d|en. By convention 1|e1. This notion was introduced by M. V. Subbarao [\cite=Su72]. The smallest exponential divisor of n > 1 is its squarefree kernel [formula].

Let [formula] and [formula] denote the number and the sum of exponential divisors of n, respectively. Properties of these functions were investigated by several authors, see [\cite=FaSu89], [\cite=KaSu2003], [\cite=PeWu97], [\cite=SmWu97], [\cite=Su72], [\cite=Wu95].

Two integers n,m > 1 have common exponential divisors iff they have the same prime factors and for [formula], [formula], ai,bi  ≥  1 (1  ≤  i  ≤  r), the greatest common exponential divisor of n and m is

[formula]

Here (1,1)e = 1 by convention and (1,m)e does not exist for m > 1.

The integers n,m > 1 are called exponentially coprime, if they have the same prime factors and (ai,bi) = 1 for every 1  ≤  i  ≤  r, with the notation of above. In this case [formula]. 1 and 1 are considered to be exponentially coprime. 1 and m > 1 are not exponentially coprime. Exponentially coprime integers were introduced by J. Sándor [\cite=Sa96].

Let pi (1  ≤  i  ≤  r) be fixed distinct primes and let P(e)(p1,...,pr;x) denote the number of pairs 〈n,m〉 of exponentially coprime integers such that [formula] and n,m  ≤  x.

In this note we estimate P(e)(p1,...,pr;x) and show that the asymptotic density of pairs of exponentially coprime integers having r fixed prime divisors is (ζ(2))- r.

As an open problem we formulate the following: What can be said on the asymptotic density of pairs of exponentially coprime integers if their prime divisors are not fixed ?

2. Results

For a real x  ≥  1 and an integer n  ≥  1 consider the Legendre-type function L(e)(x,n) defined as the number of integers k  ≤  x such that k and n are exponentially coprime.

The following estimate holds:

Theorem 1. Let r  ≥  1 be a fixed integer and p1,...,pr be fixed distinct primes. Then uniformly for the real x  ≥  3 and [formula] with a1,...,ar  ≥  1,

[formula]

where φ(a) is Euler's function and θ(a) denotes the number of squarefree divisors of a.

Let N(p1,...,pr;x) denote the number of integers n  ≤  x having the kernel [formula]. Taking [formula] we obtain from Theorem 1 the following known estimate, cf. for ex. [\cite=Te95], Ch. III.5 regarding integers free of large prime factors.

Corollary 1.

Theorem 2. Let r  ≥  1 be a fixed integer and p1,...,pr be fixed distinct primes. Then

Corollary 2. The asymptotic density of pairs of exponentially coprime integers having r fixed prime divisors is (ζ(2))- r.

3. Proofs

The proofs of Theorems 1 and 2 are by induction on r, while Corollary 3 follows from Theorem 2 and Corollary 1. First we prove the following lemma.

Lemma 1. Let r  ≥  1 be a fixed integer and t1,...,tr > 0 be fixed real numbers. Then uniformly for the real z  ≥  1 and the integers a1,...,ar  ≥  1,

[formula]

Proof of Lemma 1. We will use the well-known estimate: if s  ≥  0, then

[formula]

uniformly for z  ≥  1 and a  ≥  1.

Induction on r. For r = 1 (4) follows from (5) applied for s = 0. Suppose formula (4) is valid for r - 1 and prove it for r.

Proof of Theorem 1. Apply Lemma 1 for z =  log x, t1  =   log p1,...,tr  =   log pr.

In order to prove Theorem 2 we need

Lemma 2. Let r  ≥  1 be a fixed integer and t1,...,tr > 0 be fixed real numbers. Then for z  ≥  3,

[formula]

Proof of Lemma 2. Induction on r, similar to the proof of Lemma 1. We use the well-known estimate: let s  ≥   - 1 be a real number, then for z  ≥  3,

For r = 1 (6) follows from (7) applied for s =  - 1. Suppose formula (6) is valid for r - 1 and prove it for r.

here the O-term is O(zr - 1zr - 1z log z) = O(z2r - 1 log z) and applying Lemma 2 to the main term finishes the proof.

Proof of Theorem 2. Apply Lemma 3 for z =  log x, t1  =   log p1,...,tr  =   log pr.

Proof of Corollary 2. This is a direct consequence of Theorem 2 and Corollary 1. The considered asymptotic density is
