Masses and decay constants of Bq mesons in the QCD string approach

Introduction

The decay constants of pseudoscalar (P) mesons fP can be directly measured in P  →  μν decays [\cite=1] and therefore they can be used as an important criterium to compare different theoretical approaches and estimate their accuracy. Although during the last decade fP were calculated many times: in potential models [\cite=2] [\cite=3] [\cite=4], the QCD sum rule method [\cite=5], and in lattice QCD [\cite=6] [\cite=7], here we again address the properties of the B,Bs,Bc mesons for several reasons.

First, we use here the relativistic string Hamiltonian (RSH) [\cite=8], which is derived from the QCD Lagrangian with the use of the field correlator method (FCM) [\cite=9] and successfully applied to light mesons and heavy quarkonia [\cite=10] [\cite=11]. Here we show that the meson Green's function and decay constants can also be derived with the use of FCM.

Second, the remarkable feature of the RSH HR and also the correlator of the currents G(x) is that they are fully determined by a minimal number of fundamental parameters: the string tension σ, [formula], and the pole (current) quark masses mq(q). All these parameters are taken to be fixed from our analysis of heavy quarkonium spectra [\cite=10] and light meson Regge trajectories [\cite=11]:

[formula]

and the pole masses taken are

[formula]

Third, recently new data on the masses of Bc and the P-wave mesons: B1, B2, and Bs2 have been reported by the D0 and CDF Collaborations [\cite=12] [\cite=13], which give additional information on the Bq -meson spectra. Here we calculate the spin-averaged masses of the P-wave states B and Bs.

We would like to emphasize here that in our relativistic calculations no constituent masses are used. In the meson mass formula an overall (fitting) constant, characteristic for potential models, is absent and the whole scheme appears to be rigid.

Nevertheless, we take into account an important nonperturbative (NP) self-energy contribution to the quark mass, ΔSE(q) (see below eq. ([\ref=15])). For the heavy b quark ΔSE(b) = 0 and for the c quark ΔSE(c)≃ - 20 MeV [\cite=10], which is also small.

For any kind of mesons we use a universal static potential with pure scalar confining term,

[formula]

where the coupling αB(r) possesses the asymptotic freedom property and saturates at large distances with αcrit(nf = 4) = 0.52 [\cite=14]. The coupling can be expressed through αB(q) in momentum space,

[formula]

where

[formula]

with [formula] Here the QCD constant ΛB, is expressed as [\cite=15]

[formula]

and MB(σ,ΛB) = (1.00  ±  0.05)   ~   GeV is the so called background mass [\cite=14]. For heavy-light mesons with [formula] one obtains ΛB(nf = 4) = 355(7)  ~  MeV.

String Hamiltonian

At the first stage (1993-2005) the RSH was derived and applied to mesons, glueballs, hybrids, and baryons[\cite=9] [\cite=10]. In all cases a good agreement with experiment and lattice results have been obtained for the same minimal set of parameters.

In this work the same method is applied to the correlator of the currents which defines the decay constant fΓ in any channel Γ. For a meson the RSH can be presented as [\cite=8] [\cite=9]

[formula]

where ΔH = VLS + VSS + VT + VSE is treated as a perturbation and every term can be derived within the same method. The unperturbed RSH was deduced in [\cite=8]:

[formula]

[formula]

In ([\ref=7]) m1(m2) is the pole (current) mass of a quark (antiquark). The variable ωi is defined from extremum condition, which is taken either from (1) The exact condition: [formula], which gives

[formula]

Then

[formula]

reduces to the Salpeter equation, which just defines [formula] as a constituent mass. (2) The approximate condition: [formula] (the so-called einbein approximation). As shown in [\cite=9] the difference between ωi and i is [formula] 5%.

For the RSH ([\ref=6]) the spin-averaged mass [formula] is given by a simple expression:

[formula]

with

[formula]

In the general case, the self-energy term ΔSE is shown to be defined by the analytic formula [\cite=16]

[formula]

with ηf = 0.9 for a u(d) quark, [formula] for an s quark, ηf  =  0.4 for a c quark, and ηb = 0. Therefore, for a b quark ΔSE(b) = 0. The mass formula ([\ref=11]) does not contain any overall constant C. Note that the presence of C violates linear behavior of Regge trajectories.

The calculated masses of the low-lying states of B, Bs, and Bc mesons are given in Table [\ref=tab1], as well as their values taken from [\cite=2] [\cite=3] [\cite=6] [\cite=7].

It is of interest to notice that in our calculations the masses of the P-wave states appear to be by 30-70 MeV lower than in [\cite=2] due to taking into account a string correction [\cite=11].

Current Correlator

The FCM can be also used to define the correlator GΓ(x) of the currents jΓ(x),

[formula]

for S,P,V, and A channels (here the operator [formula]). The correlator,

[formula]

with the use of spectral decomposition of the currents jΓ and the definition,

[formula]

can be presented as [\cite=3]

[formula]

On the other hand, applying the FCM and RSH, a very useful relation can be derived [\cite=18]:

[formula]

Here YP(YV) for the P(V) channel is given by a simple expression:

[formula]

Then from Eqs. ([\ref=15]) and ([\ref=16]) one obtains the following analytical expression for the decay constants (for a given state labelled n):

[formula]

This very transparent formula contains only well defined factors: ω1 and ωb, the meson mass Mn, and φn the eigenvector of Ĥ0. Then in the P channel

[formula]

where the w.f. at the origin, φn(0), is a relativistic one. In the nonrelativistic limit ωi  →  mi, φn(0)  →  φNRn(0) and one comes to the standard expression:

[formula]

The calculated decay constants are given in Table [\ref=tab1] and their values turn out to be in good agreement with lattice data [\cite=6] [\cite=7] and the predictions of Ref. [\cite=3]. Our analysis also shows that fBc is sensitive to the value taken for mc (pole).

Conclusions

From our analysis it follows that

The dynamics of heavy-light mesons is sensitive to the number of flavors nf and to the value of the quark pole mass used (more sensitive than in the case of c and b spectra). For Bq mesons nf = 4 is used.

Solutions of the Salpeter equation using the RSH give the masses of B, ~ B1, and B2 and also Bs and Bc in agreement with experiment within ±  10 MeV accuracy.

For B* and B*s agreement with experimental values is reached if αHF = 0.32(1) s used in the hyperfine interaction.

For the same αHF = 0.32 we predict ΔHF(Bc) = 50 MeV or M(B*c) = 6325 MeV.

In our analytic approach with minimal input of fundamental parameters (σ,αs,mi) the calculated decay constants are fB = 186 ~ MeV, ~ fBs = 222 ~ MeV, ~ fBs / fB = 1.19.

For Bc the decay constant is very sensitive to mc (pole): fBc  =  440 ~ MeV  ~  (mc = 1.40 ~ GeV) and fBc = 425 ~ MeV  ~  (mc = 1.35 ~ GeV)
