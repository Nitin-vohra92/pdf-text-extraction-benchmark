On Faltings' annihilator theorem

Introduction

Throughout the present article, A always denotes a commutative Noetherian ring. We say that the annihilator theorem holds for A if it satisfies the following proposition [\cite=MR82f:13003].

Faltings [\cite=MR58:22058] proved that the annihilator theorem holds for A if A has a dualizing complex or if A is a homomorphic image of a regular ring and that (2) always implies (1). Several authors [\cite=MR2002b:13027] [\cite=MR99h:13020] [\cite=MR2052396] [\cite=MR2229481] [\cite=MR94e:13033] tried to improve Faltings' result. In this article, the author shows the following

The annihilator theorem holds for A if

A is universally catenary;

all the formal fibers of all the localizations of A are Cohen-Macaulay; and

the Cohen-Macaulay locus of each finitely generated A-algebra is open.

These conditions are not only sufficient but also necessary for the annihilator theorem. Indeed, Faltings [\cite=MR82f:13003] showed that A satisfies (C1)-(C3) whenever the annihilator theorem holds for each essentially of finite type A-algebra.

These conditions are also related to the uniform Artin-Rees theorem and the uniform Brianon-Skoda theorem. We give an affirmative answer to the conjecture of Huneke [\cite=MR93b:13027] in the last section.

Preliminaries

First we recall the definition of the local cohomology functor. A subset Z of [formula] is said to be stable under specialization if [formula] implies [formula]. Let M be an A-module and Z a subset of [formula] which is stable under specialization. Then we put

[formula]

It is an A-submodule of M and H0Z( - ) is a left exact functor.

The local cohomology functor HpZ( - ) with respect to Z is the right derived functor of H0Z( - ).

If [formula] is an ideal, then [formula] is stable under specialization and HpZ( - ) coincides with the ordinary local cohomology functor [formula].

Let Z be a subset of [formula] which is stable under specialization. If [formula], [formula] are ideals such that [formula], [formula], then [formula]. Therefore the set F of all ideals [formula] such that [formula] is a directed set with respect to the opposite inclusion. If [formula], [formula] such that [formula], then there is a natural transformation [formula]. Since [formula], we obtain the natural isomorphism

[formula]

The following lemma was essentially given by Raghavan [\cite=MR94e:13033].

Let M be a finitely generated A-module. Then [formula] is stable under specialization} is a finite set.

Let [formula] and [formula] be a primary decomposition of 0 in M where [formula] for all i. Then [formula]. Therefore #  L  ≤  2r.

We need Cousin complexes to prove Theorem [\ref=thm:1.1].

Let M be a finitely generated A-module. For a prime ideal [formula], the M-height of [formula] is defined to be [formula]. If [formula] is an ideal in A such that [formula], then let [formula].

The Cousin complex [formula] of M is defined as follows:

Let M- 2  =  0, M- 1  =  M and d- 2M:M- 2  →  M- 1 be the zero map. If p  ≥  0 and dp - 2M:Mp - 2  →  Mp - 1 is given, then we put

[formula]

If ξ∈Mp - 1 and [formula] is the image of ξ in [formula], then the component of dpM(ξ) in [formula] is  / 1.

The following theorem contains [\cite=MR91g:13010].

Assume that A satisfies (C1)-(C3) and let M be a finitely generated A-module satisfying

[formula] for any [formula], [formula] such that [formula].

Then there is an ideal [formula] in A satisfying the following properties:

(1) [formula] is the non-Cohen-Macaulay locus of M. In particular, [formula].

(2) Let Z be a subset of [formula] which are stable under specialization and n an integer. If [formula] for any [formula], then [formula] for each p  <  n.

(3) Let x1, , xn∈A be a sequence. If [formula], then [formula] annihilates the Koszul cohomology module [formula] of M with respect to x1, , xn for any p  <  n.

Let [formula] be the Cousin complex of M and [formula] the product of all the annihilators of all the non-zero cohomologies of [formula]. Then it is well-defined and satisfies (1). See [\cite=Kawasaki::finiteness].

We prove (2). Because of [\eqref=eqn:2.1.1], it is enough to show that [formula] for any ideal [formula] such that [formula] and for any p  <  n. Let [formula] be such an ideal and [formula] a free resolution of [formula]. The double complex [formula] gives two spectral sequences

[formula]

The first spectral sequence tells us that [formula] for any k.

On the other hand, [formula] if p  <   - 1 or if q  <  0. Let 0  ≤  p  <  n be an integer and [formula] such that [formula]. Since [formula], we find that [formula] is exact. Hence [formula] is also exact. Thus [formula] if 0  ≤  p  <  n and [formula]. If k  <  n, then [formula] whenever p  ≠   - 1. Therefore [formula] is annihilated by [formula].

Next we consider (3). Let [formula] be the Koszul complex of A with respect to x1, , xn. By considering the double complex [formula], instead of [formula], we obtain the assertion.

The proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:1.1]

Before the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:1.1], we fix some notation. Let [formula] be the free Abelian group with basis [formula] and [formula] for all [formula]. If [formula] and [formula] where [formula] whenever i  ≠  j, then we put

[formula]

It is clear that [formula]. Let [formula] and Y be a subset of [formula] which is stable under specialization. Then we put [formula]. Since [formula], Theorem [\ref=thm:1.1] is contained in the following

Assume that A satisfies (C1)-(C3). If M is a finitely generated A-module, then there is [formula] satisfying the following property:

Let Y, Z be subsets of [formula] which are stable under specialization and n an integer. If

[formula] for any [formula] and [formula],

then

[formula] annihilates H0Z(M), , Hn - 1Z(M).

We prove this theorem by the Noetherian induction on [formula] and the induction on the number of associated primes of M.

If M  =  0, then α(M)  =  0 obviously satisfies the assertion. Assume that M  ≠  0 and that, for any finitely generated A-module M', there is α(M') satisfying the assertion of Theorem [\ref=thm:3.1] if [formula] or if [formula] and [formula]. We first prove the following claim.

There is [formula] satisfying the following property:

Let Y, Z be subsets of [formula] which are stable under specialization and n an integer. If [formula] and (A) holds, then (B) also does.

Let [formula]. We may assume that [formula], , Pr without loss of generality. There is an exact sequence

[formula]

such that [formula] and [formula]. Since A is universally catenary and N has the unique minimal prime, N satisfies (QU). Let [formula] be the ideal obtained by applying Theorem [\ref=thm:2.4] to N. Then [formula]. Since [formula], , Pr, we find that [formula], , Pr. Let [formula].

Since [formula] or since [formula] and [formula], there is [formula] satisfying the assertion of Theorem [\ref=thm:3.1]. Let [formula]. We may assume that Q1, , [formula] and Qs0 + 1, , [formula]. Let [formula] and x  =  x'x''.

Since x is an M-non zero divisor, [formula]. We want to show that α'(M)  =  α(M / xM) satisfies the assertion of the claim.

Let Y, Z be subsets of [formula] which are stable under specialization and n an integer. Assume that [formula] and [formula] for any [formula] and [formula]. If [formula], then [formula] because [formula] and P1∉Y. Since [formula], we have

[formula]

By using Theorem [\ref=thm:2.4] (2), we find that x''HpZ(N)  =  0 for any p  <  n.

Let [formula] and [formula]. Since [formula], [formula] is Cohen-Macaulay. If [formula], then [formula] and hence

[formula]

Here we used [\eqref=eqn:3.1.1]. If [formula], then [formula] and hence [formula]. Since [formula], the assumption tells us that [formula]. Therefore [formula]. Because of the induction hypothesis,

[formula]

for p  <  n.

Since [formula], P1, , Pr∉Y and Qs0 + 1, , [formula], we have Qs0 + 1, , [formula]. Therefore [formula] and hence x'HpZ(L)  =  0 if p  <  n. Since HpZ(L)  →  HpZ(M)  →  HpZ(N) is exact, xHpZ(M)  =  0 if p  <  n.

Since x is an M-non zero divisor, H0Z(M)  =  0,

[formula]

is exact for p  <  n and [formula] for any [formula] and [formula]. Therefore [formula] annihilates HpZ(M) if p  <  n.

Next we give α(M). Let [formula] and [formula] be a primary decomposition of 0 in M such that [formula]. Then there are integers k1, , kr such that PkiiM  ⊂  Mi for each i.

Let [formula] is stable under specialization[formula]. Assume that L1  =  0 and L2, , Ls  ≠  0. Since [formula] or [formula], [formula], there is [formula] satisfying the assertion of Theorem [\ref=thm:3.1] for each i  =  2, , s. We put [formula]. Then α(M) has required property.

Indeed, let Y, Z be subsets of [formula] which are stable under specialization and n an integer. If H0Y(M)  =  0, then [formula] and hence [formula] annihilates H0Z(M), , Hn - 1Z(M). Assume that H0Y(M)  =  Lj for some 2  ≤  j  ≤  s. If [formula] and [formula], then [formula] and hence [formula]. Therefore [formula] annihilates H0Z(M / Lj), , Hn - 1Z(M / Lj). On the other hand, since there is a monomorphism

[formula]

we find that [formula]. Since HpZ(Lj)  →  HpZ(M)  →  HpZ(M / Lj) is exact, [formula] annihilates H0Z(M), , Hn - 1Z(M). Thus (B) holds.

If L1, , Ls are all non-zero, then we put [formula]. We can show that α(M) satisfies the assertion of Theorem [\ref=thm:3.1] in the same way as above. The proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:1.1] is completed.

The following corollary is an improvement of [\cite=MR94e:13033].

Assume that A satisfies (C1)-(C3). If M is a finitely generated A-module, then there is a positive integer k satisfying the following property:

Let [formula], [formula] be ideals in A and n an integer. If [formula] for any [formula] and [formula], then [formula] for all p  <  n.

Let [formula] and [formula]. Then [formula].

A conjecture of Huneke

The following theorem is an affirmative answer to Conjecture 2.13 of [\cite=MR93b:13027]. Its proof is similar to that of Theorem [\ref=thm:2.4].

Assume that A satisfies (C1)-(C3) and let M be a finitely generated A-module satisfying (QU). Then there is an ideal [formula] in A satisfying the following property:

[formula].

Let

[formula]

be a complex of finitely generated free A-modules such that

[formula];

[formula] for each - n  <  i  <  0;

[formula] for each - n  ≤  i  <  0 where [formula] for each i.

Then [formula] for all p  <  0. Here Iri(fi) denotes the ideal generated by all the ri-minors of the representation matrix of fi.

Let [formula] be the Cousin complex of M and [formula] the product of all the annihilators of all the non-zero cohomologies of [formula]. Then [formula] satisfies ([\ref=item:4.1.1]). The double complex [formula] gives a spectral sequence

[formula]

It tells us that [formula] for all p. On the other hand, [formula] gives another spectral sequence [formula] where [formula] is the cohomology of

[formula]

If 0  ≤  p  <  n and [formula] such that [formula], then

[formula]

is split exact and hence [formula] if q  <   - p. Therefore [formula] if p  >  0 and p + q  <  0. Furthermore [formula] for each q  <  0. Of course, [formula] if p  <   - 1. Thus [formula] is annihilated by [formula] if p  <  0.
