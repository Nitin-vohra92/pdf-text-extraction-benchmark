CROSSOVER, FLUCTUATIONS AND ANDERSON TRANSITION IN QUARK MATTER FORMATION B. KERBIKOV Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics, Moscow, Russia; email: borisk@itep.ru

During the last years, the investigation of quark matter at finite temperature and density has become one of the QCD focal points. Based on model calculations it has been predicted that at densities 3-5 times larger than the normal nuclear density the system is unstable with respect to the formation of quark-quark Cooper-pair condensate. This phenomenon is called color superconductivity since diquarks belong to [formula] color channel. At present there is a fair understanding of color superconductivity physics in the regime of ultra-high density when αs is small. It took quite some time before it has been realized [\cite=1] [\cite=2] that halfway between the nuclear matter phase and color superconducting state lies a new state unlike anything seen before.

Shortly after the formulation of the BCS theory it has been realized that in one extreme case fermions can pair strongly forming compact nuclear-like states while at the other end of the spectrum they can pair weakly forming Cooper pairs. The continuous transition between the two regimes is called the BEC-BCS crossover (transition from Bose-Einstein condensation to Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer regime). The dimensionless crossover parameter in n1 / 3ξ, where n is the quark number density and ξ is the characteristic length of pair correlation when the system is in the BCS regime and ξ is the root of the mean square radius of the bound state when the system is in the strong coupling regime. The crossover occurs at n1 / 3ξ  ~  1. Calculations within the framework of the NJL-type models show that the gap equation acquires a nontrivial solution Δ  ≠  0 when the quark chemical potential reaches the value μ≃0.4 GeV which corresponds to n1 / 3≃1 fm- 1. The pair size in this region is ξ≃2 fm, so that n1 / 3ξ  ~  1 (for electron superconductors [formula]). We see that NM  →  QM transition brings the system to the crossover regime and not to color superconducting state.

The transition region is also characterized by strong fluctuations of both quark and gluon fields. The two phenomena - crossover and strong fluctuations, are interrelated as we shall see from Eq. ([\ref=1]) below. Due to fluctuating quark pairs the energy spectrum develops a pseudogap instead of the true gap typical for the BCS regime. Fluctuation contribution to the physical quantities and the width of the fluctuation region is measured by the Ginzburg-Levanyuk number Gi which can be estimated as

[formula]

where Tc≃40 - 50 MeV is the critical temperature. In the transition region Tc  /  μ≃0.1, the crossover parameter n1 / 3ξ≃1 - 2, so that Gi≃10- 2 which is a huge number as compared to Gi≃10- 12 - 10- 14 for metal superconductors and several magnitudes larger than for HTSC.

Fluctuating pre-formed quark pairs are responsible for the pseudogap phenomena, while fluctuating gluon field gives rise to induced color diamagnetism. Color field fluctuations may be characterized by the average 〈2〉 of the gauge field in a fixed configuration of the quark field [\cite=3] [\cite=4]. The critical temperature gets lower according to the following equation

[formula]

where g2  =  4παS is the strong coupling constant.

The third basic feature of the transition region is the deformation of the gradient term in the Ginzburg-Landau functional. In momentum space the G - L functional reads

[formula]

The standard expression for c is c = νFξ2 with νF being the density of states at the Fermi level. In the transition region the coefficient c may be expressed via the quark dynamical diffusion coefficient D(ω) which in its turn is expressed via the correlator of the two quark Green's functions. The characteristic frequency ω depends on the dynamics of the gluon field in the transition region which is as yet ill understood. One may think that ω is equal to the gluelump mass but this is a problem for further work. An interesting scenario of the behavior of the coefficient c involving Anderson localization is possible. In case when the quark chemical potential μ and the quark mean free path l meet the condition [formula] the system may undergo Anderson phase transition which would lead to the decrease of the coefficient c in the G - L functional([\ref=3]).

Detailed considerations of some problems touched upon in this talk as well as a list of references can be found in our recent paper [\cite=5].
