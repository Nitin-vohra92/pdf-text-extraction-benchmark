A Class of Groups in Which All Unconditionally Closed Sets are Algebraic

Markov [\cite=Markov1945] called a subset A of a group G unconditionally closed in G if it is closed in any Hausdorff group topology on G. Clearly, all solution sets of equations in G, as well as their finite unions and arbitrary intersections, are unconditionally closed.

A subset A of a group G with identity element 1 is said to be elementary algebraic in G if there exists a word w = w(x) in the alphabet [formula] (x is a variable) such that A  =  {x∈G:w(x)  =  1}. Finite unions of elementary algebraic sets are additively algebraic sets. An arbitrary intersection of additively algebraic sets is called algebraic. Thus, the algebraic sets in G are the solution sets of arbitrary conjunctions of finite disjunctions of equations.

In his 1945 paper [\cite=Markov1945], Markov showed that any algebraic set is unconditionally closed and posed the problem of whether the converse is true. In [\cite=Markov1946] (see also [\cite=Markov1944]), he solved this problem for countable groups by proving that any unconditionally closed set in a countable group is algebraic. In this paper, we show that the answer is also positive for some subgroups of direct products of countable groups (in particular, for all Abelian groups); the proof is based on Markov's ideas. In the general case, the answer is negative (at least, under the continuum hypothesis) [\cite=Sipa].

Let m be a positive integer. By a multiplicative function of m arguments we mean an arbitrary word on the alphabet [formula]. The length of the function is equal to the length of this word. Suppose that G is a group and [formula]. The value of a multiplicative function [formula] (of m arguments) at [formula] in G is defined as

[formula]

For a subset A of a group G, [formula] (or simply [formula]) denotes the algebraic closure of A in G, i.e., the least algebraic set in G containing A.

In what follows, we consider algebraic closures only in H.

Following Dikranjan and Shakhmatov, we say that a subgroup H' of a group H is supernormal in H if, for every x∈H, there exists a y∈H' such that x- 1hx  =  y- 1hy for all h∈H.

By a countable subproduct of a direct product [formula] of groups we mean any product of the form [formula], where G'α  =  Gα for countably many indices α and G'α  =  {1α} for the remaining α ({1α} denotes the identity element of the group Gα).

If H is a subgroup of a direct product G of countable groups such that [formula] is supernormal in H for any countable subproduct G' of G, then A  ⊂  H is unconditionally closed in H if and only if it is algebraic in H.

Let G be the direct product of countable groups Gα, where α∈I, and let H be a subgroup of G with the property specified in the statement of the theorem. By 1 and 1α we denote the identity elements of G and Gα, respectively.

Suppose that A  ⊂  H, [formula], and 1∉A (in particular, A is not algebraic in H). Let us show that A is not unconditionally closed in H. We set a0  =  1 and take an arbitrary element [formula]. This element has only finitely many nonzero coordinates; we denote their indices by [formula]. Note that the set of all multiplicative functions of length < 6 with 2 arguments is finite. Let [formula] be the (finite) subset of this set consisting of all functions Φ for which

[formula]

We set

[formula]

and

[formula]

The set B1 is additively algebraic. We have 1∉B1. On the other hand, [formula]. Since [formula] is the algebraic closure of A, we have [formula]. Take [formula]. Note that x1  ≠  a0,a1. Indeed, x1  ≠  a0  =  1 because x1∈A∋1, and x  ≠  a1 because Φ = (1,1)(1, - 1) is a multiplicative function of length 2 with two arguments for which Φ(a1,a1)  =  a1a- 11  =  1 but Φ(a1,1)  =  a1  ≠  1.

Let [formula] be a finite subset of the index set I such that [formula] and the indices of all nonidentity coordinates of the element [formula] are contained in [formula] (here and in what follows, [formula] denotes direct product). Let us number all elements a of the at most countable set [formula], where G'α = Gα for [formula] and G'α  =  {1α} for [formula], by positive integers ≥  2 so that infinitely many numbers remain unoccupied but the number 2 is occupied, i.e., a2 is defined (e.g., we can put a2 = x1 and use only even numbers for numbering; in this case, we have [formula]. The set [formula] may be finite, but it necessarily contains a0, a1, and a2).

Take an element a2. Arguing as above, we choose x2∈A so that if Φ is a multiplicative function of length < 9 with 4 arguments and Φ(a1,a2,x1,x2)  =  1, then Φ(a1,a2,x1,1)  =  1, and show that x2  ≠  a0,a1,a2. Let n2  >  n1, and let [formula] be a set of indices which contains the indices of all nonidentity coordinates of x2. Let us number all unnumbered elements a of the at most countable set [formula], where G''α = Gα for [formula] and G''α  =  {1α} for [formula], by positive integers that have not been used at the preceding step so that infinitely many numbers remain unoccupied but the number 3 is occupied (e.g., we can put a3 = x2 and use only odd numbers divisible by 3 for numbering).

At the jth step, the situation is as follows. Positive integers [formula] and indices [formula] are defined; elements [formula] and [formula], where G'''α = Gα for [formula] and G''α  =  {1α} for [formula], are defined; all elements a of the at most countable set [formula] are numbered by positive integers, and infinitely many positive integers remain unoccupied (however, the numbers [formula] are occupied by the elements [formula]). Moreover, for any multiplicative function Φ of length < 3j with 2(j - 1) arguments satisfying the condition [formula], we have [formula]. Let us define xj.

The set of all multiplicative functions of length < 3(j + 1) with 2j arguments is finite. Let [formula] be its subset consisting of all functions Φ for which

[formula]

We set

[formula]

and

[formula]

The set Bj is additively algebraic, and 1∉Bj. On the other hand, [formula]. Since [formula] is the algebraic closure of A, we have [formula]. Choose any [formula]. Clearly, [formula], because if xj = ai, then Φ = (i,1)(2j, - 1) is a multiplicative function of length <  3(j + 1) with 2j arguments for which [formula] but [formula]. Take sufficiently large number nj > nj - 1 and set [formula] for which all coordinates of the element xj with indices not belonging to [formula] are the identity elements of the corresponding factors. Let us number all elements a of the at most countable set [formula] (where G''''α = Gα for [formula] and G''''α  =  {1α} for [formula]) which have not been numbered at the preceding steps by positive integers not occupied at the preceding steps so that infinitely many numbers remain unoccupied. If the element aj + 1 has not yet been defined (i.e., the number j + 1 is unoccupied), then we set aj + 1 = xj.

As a result, we obtain a countable set [formula]; all elements of the set [formula], where G*α = Gα for α∈I* and G*α  =  {1α} for α∉I*, are numbered by nonnegative integers: [formula], where and a0 = 1. We also have a sequence [formula] such that if Φ is a multiplicative function of length < 3(j + 1) with 2j arguments and [formula], then [formula]. We set [formula].

Note that G* is a countable supernormal subgroup of H and A*  ⊂  G*. Thus, the situation is quite similar to that considered by Markov in [\cite=Markov1946]. The role of the group G from [\cite=Markov1946] is played by G*, and the role of A is played by A*. In [\cite=Markov1946], Markov defined sequences {bi}∞i = 1, {ai}∞i = 1, and {xi}∞i = 1 with certain properties (the properties of the first sequence are labeled by 2.31 and 2.32 in his paper, the properties of the second are labeled by 2.41-2.44, and the properties of the third are labeled by 2.51 and 2.52). We set bi  =  1 for all i; the sequences {ai}∞i = 1 and {xi}∞i = 1 are already constructed. These sequences have all of the properties mentioned above except 2.32. However, 2.32 is not used in Sections 6-12 of [\cite=Markov1946]; therefore, the argument from these sections applies to the case under consideration without any changes (except that G should be replaced by G* and A by A*); in particular, the functions fj on the sets

[formula]

given by

[formula]

are well defined and can be extended to seminorms Nj on the group G*. Following Markov [\cite=Markov1946], for any positive integer n and sets of integers {pj}nj = 1 and {qj}nj = 1, where pj  ≥  0 and qj > 0 for [formula], we define a seminorm [formula] on G* by

[formula]

we have N0q  =  Nq for [formula], because a0  =  1. Markov showed that these seminorms determine a group topology T* on G*; its neighborhood base at the identity consists of all sets of the form

[formula]

where [formula] for some [formula] and [formula].

Let us prove that 1 belongs to the closure of A* in this topology. It is sufficient to show that UN intersects A* for any N.

Let [formula]. Take a positive integer s such that s > n, s > pj, and s > qj for [formula]. By definition, we have

[formula]

Therefore, xs∈UN. On the other hand, xs∈A* by construction.

Thus, the set A* is not closed in the group G* with the topology T*. Since G* is a supernormal subgroup of H, the neighborhoods of the identity in the topology T* form a neighborhood base of the identity for some group topology T on H. Since any neighborhood of the identity in T* intersects A* and [formula], it follows that any neighborhood of the identity in T intersects A. Thus, A is not unconditionally closed in H.

Now, let B be an arbitrary nonalgebraic set in H; then [formula]. Take [formula]. We have 1∉b- 1B. On the other hand, [formula]. According to Lemma 12 from [\cite=Markov1946], [formula]; hence [formula]. As was shown above, this implies the nonclosedness of the set b- 1B (and, therefore, of B itself) in some group topology on H. Thus, if the set B is not algebraic in H, then it cannot be unconditionally closed in H. On the other hand, any algebraic set in the group H is unconditionally closed in H [\cite=Markov1946].

If G is an Abelian group and A  ⊂  G, then A is unconditionally closed in G if and only if it is algebraic in G.

This assertion follows immediately from the fact that any Abelian group can be embedded in a direct product of countable groups as a subgroup (see, e.g., [\cite=Kaplansky]) and that any subgroup of an Abelian group is supernormal in this group.

If G is a direct product of countable groups and A  ⊂  G, then A is unconditionally closed in G if and only if it is algebraic in G.

Indeed, any countable subproduct in a direct product of groups is a supernormal subgroup of the entire product.

Note that if G1 and G2 are two groups and H1  ⊂  G1 and H2  ⊂  G2 are their supernormal subgroups, then, obviously, H1  ×  H2 is supernormal in G1  ×  G2. This implies the following assertion.

If G = G1  ×  G2, where G1 in an Abelian group and G2 is a direct product of countable groups, and A  ⊂  G, then A is unconditionally closed in G if and only if it is algebraic in G.
