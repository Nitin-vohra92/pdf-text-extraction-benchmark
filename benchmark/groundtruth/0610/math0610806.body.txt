Remark

Strictly nearly Kähler 6-manifolds are not compatible with symplectic forms

introduction

Every symplectic manifold (M,ω) gives rise to an infinite dimensional, contractible Fréchet space of ω-compatible almost complex structures, J, introduced by the property that the bilinear form g(  ·  ,  ·  ) = ω(  ·  ,J  ·  ) is symmetric and positive-definite (i.e. defines a Riemannian metric on M); in this case the (J,g) is an almost Hermitian structure on M, which is referred to as an almost Kähler structure compatible with ω.

It is natural to wonder whether or not a given almost complex structure J on M is ω-compatible for some symplectic form ω? This question, which was first raised and studied by J. Armstrong in [\cite=armstrong], can be asked both locally and globally and the corresponding answers are quite different in nature. In this Note we are interested in the local aspect of the problem, namely we consider the following

Question 1. Is a given almost complex structure J on M locally compatible with symplectic forms? In other words, given J, can one find in a neighbourhood of each point of M a symplectic form compatible with J?

Following [\cite=riviere-tian-2], we shall refer to almost complex structures which are locally compatible with symplectic forms as almost complex structures having the local symplectic property. Further motivation for studying in a greater detail this property comes from [\cite=riviere-tian-1] [\cite=riviere-tian-2], where it shown that many features of the theory of pseudo-holomorphic mappings and currents on symplectic and complex manifolds can be extended to compact almost complex manifolds having the local symplectic property.

As a trivial example, any integrable almost complex structure satisfies the local symplectic property (although there are many complex manifolds which are not symplectic). In particular, when M is 2-dimensional the answer of Question 1 is always positive.

The 4-dimensional case

We start by providing a detailed proof of the following observation made in [\cite=armstrong]:

Any almost complex manifold of dimension 4 has the local symplectic property.

A proof of this result is readily available in [\cite=riviere-tian-1]. For the sake of completeness, and since we find the arguments in [\cite=riviere-tian-1] incomplete (see Remark [\ref=error1] below), we give here an alternative argument based on the Malgrange existence theorem of local solutions of elliptic systems of PDE's.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=th1]. Let (M,J) an almost complex 4-manifold. The vector bundle of (real) 2-forms, [formula], decomposes with respect to J as a direct sum [formula] where [formula] (resp. [formula]) is the vector bundle of [formula]-invariant 2-forms (resp. [formula]-anti-invariant) 2-forms. (The vector bundle [formula], endowed with the complex structure (Jφ)(  ·  ,  ·  ):  =    -  φ(J  ·  ,  ·  ), is naturally isomorphic to the anti-canonical bundle [formula] of (M,J); likewise, [formula].) We denote by ΩJ,  ±(M) etc. the spaces of smooth sections of the corresponding bundles. The above splitting of real 2-forms gives rise to a decomposition of the exterior derivative d:Ω1(M)  →  Ω2(M) as the sum of two differential operators d±:Ω1(M)  →  ΩJ,  ±(M).

In order to prove Theorem [\ref=th1], it is enough to show that for any point p∈M there exists a (connected) neighborhood U∋p and a 1-form α∈Ω1(U), such that, on U,

[formula]

where the sign of a 4-form is determined by the orientation induced by J. Indeed, the 2-form ω  =  dα  =  d+α will be then symplectic and [formula]-invariant. It follows that at each point of U, g(  ·  ,  ·  ): = ω(  ·  ,J  ·  ) is a hermitian-symmetric 2-form on (T(M),J), which can be diagonalized with respect to an Hermitian product h; the condition [formula] means that g has a positive determinant with respect to h; since we are in complex dimension 2, the latter condition implies that g is either positive or negative definite at the given point (and hence by continuity everywhere on U); the almost complex structure J is, therefore, compatible with either ω or -  ω.

To solve [\eqref=conditions], we first notice that the principal symbol of d- is the linear map

[formula]

where [formula] and J* acts on [formula] by (J*α)(X) =  - α(JX). Thus, in 4 dimensions, [formula] is surjective for any [formula].

We can then associate to d- a second order elliptic linear differential operator P:ΩJ, -(M)  →  ΩJ, -(M) by putting P: = d-δh, where h is some J-compatible almost Hermitian metric on (M,J) and δh:Ω2(M)  →  Ω1(M) is the corresponding co-differential, the formal adjoint operator of d with respect to L2-product defined by h. (The principal symbol of P is given by [formula]).

In terms of P, we want to show that for any given point p∈M one can a find a (connected) neighborhood U∋p and a J-anti-invariant 2-form Φ∈ΩJ, -(U), such that

[formula]

at any point of U. Since P is elliptic, it is enough to find a smooth 2-form Φ0∈ΩJ, -(M), which verifies [\eqref=conditions1] only at p (i.e. an infinitesimal solution of [\ref=conditions1]). Indeed, for any such Φ0 one can consider the system P(Ψ) + P(Φ0) = 0. Using the implicit function theorem, it is shown in [\cite=malgrange] that for any ε > 0 there exist a neighborhood Uε of p and a solution Ψε∈ΩJ, -(Uε) with [formula] (where ||  ·  || stands for the Hölder norm of C2,α(U)). Then, for ε small enough, Φ  =  Φ0  +  Ψε and U = Uε will satisfy [\eqref=conditions1].

We thus reduced the problem to verifying that at each point p∈M an infinitesimal solution always exists (for a suitable choice of h). Denote by [formula] the space of [formula]-jets at p of elements of ΩJ, -(M) (where [formula] stands for the [formula]-th symmetric tensor power). By the Borel lemma, for any sequence [formula], there exists a Φ∈ΩJ, -(M) whose [formula]-th jet at p is [formula]. Thus, it is enough to show that there exists jets e = (a2,a1,a0) such that P(e) = 0 and [formula], where the linear differential operators of order ≤  2 are identified with the induced linear maps on the space of jets of order ≤  2. In fact, we will seek for an e verifying the yet stronger condition ((dδh(e))0 = 0, where (  ·  )0 denotes the primitive part of a 2-form (i.e. the orthogonal projection to [formula]). Clearly, (dδh(e))0 = 0 implies P(e) = 0 and [formula], where Lh corresponds to the the linear differential operator Lh(Φ): = h(dδhΦ,F). It follows that [formula] which is positive as soon as Lh(e)  ≠  0. A standard calculation shows that Lh is, in fact, of order one and has principle symbol

[formula]

where θh:  =  JδhF is the Lee form of (h,J), [formula] stands the isomorphism between T*(M) and T(M) via h, {ei} is any h-orthonormal basis of Tp(M) and

[formula]

is the Nijenhuis tensor of J. By making a conformal change efh with f(p) = 0,dfp  ≠  0, if necessary, we may assume that σξ(Lh)  ≠  0. Thus, we can start with e' = (a1,a0) such that Lh(e')  ≠  0. The principal symbol of (dδh) is

[formula]

By polarization over ξ, it induces a linear map from [formula] to the space of primitive 2-forms [formula] which turns out to be surjective. This tells us that there exists an [formula] such that e = (a2,a1,a0) verifies (dδh(e))0 = 0. Since Lh(e) = Lh(e')  ≠  0, this concludes the proof.

Strictly nearly Kähler 6-manifolds

The situation dramatically changes in dimension greater than 4. Indeed, it follows from [\cite=bryant-2] that the standard almost complex structure of S6 does not satisfy the local symplectic property; A. Tomassini [\cite=tomassini] gave other explicit examples of 6-dimensional almost complex manifolds which do not satisfy the local symplectic property. In dimension greater than 10, J. Armstrong [\cite=armstrong] proved that there is an open set of (germs of) almost complex structures which doesn't satisfy the local symplectic property. Nevertheless, a criterion of deciding if a given almost complex structure has the local symplectic property is still to come.

We give below a negative answer to Question 1 for a special class of almost complex 6-manifolds of increasing current interest, the so-called strictly nearly Kähler 6-manifolds (see e.g. [\cite=butruille] [\cite=gray] [\cite=moroianu-et-al] [\cite=nagy] [\cite=carrion] [\cite=verbitsky] and the references therein).

The underlying almost complex structure of a non-integrable, nearly Kähler 6-manifold is not compatible with any symplectic form.

Recall that an almost Hermitian structure (h,J) is nearly Kähler if the covariant derivative (with respect to the Levi-Civita connection Dh) of the corresponding fundamental 2-form F(  ·  ,  ·  )  =  h(J  ·  ,  ·  ) satisfies [formula] (nearly Kähler manifolds was first studied by A. Gray [\cite=gray]). Equivalently, the Nijenhuis thensor N is related to dF by (see e.g. [\cite=kobayashi-nomizu]):

[formula]

Apart from the integrable case, examples include S6 with its canonical almost complex structure and metric, the bi-invariant almost complex structure on S3  ×  S3 with its 3-symmetric almost-Hermitian structure, the twistor spaces over Einstein self-dual 4-manifolds, endowed with the anti-tautological almost complex structure.

A key property of a non-integrable nearly Kähler 6-manifold is that the 3-form dF is the imaginary part of a nowhere vanishing complex (3,0)-form Ψ on (M,J) [\cite=carrion]. The identity [\eqref=NK-N] then reads as

[formula]

where the Nijenhuis tensor N is viewed as a linear map [formula], the induced Hermitian metric h* on (T*M,J*) provides an isomorphism [formula], and the complex volume form Ψ identifies [formula] with [formula].

Theorem [\ref=th2] is then an immediate corollary of the following

Let (M,J) be an almost complex 6-manifold. Suppose that at some point p the Nijenhuis tensor N does not vanish and can be written in the form

[formula]

where [formula] defines a real, J*p-invariant, symmetric quasi-definite form on T*p(M), and [formula] is a non-zero (3,0)-form. Then, J cannot be compatible with any symplectic form defined in a neighborhood of p.

Proof of Lemma [\ref=main]. Since h*p is J*p-invariant, symmetric and quasi-definite, there exists a basis {α1,α2,α3} of [formula], with dual basis {Z1,Z2,Z3} of T1,0p(M), such that [formula] with λi  ≥  0, and [formula]. (Since Np is not zero, at least one of the λi's is positive.) The condition [\eqref=algebraic] then reads as

[formula]

Suppose J is ω-compatible for some symplectic form about p. The corresponding almost Kähler structure (J,g,ω) then satisfies (see e.g. [\cite=kobayashi-nomizu]): (DgXω)(Y,Z) =  - 2g(JN(Y,Z),X), where Dg is the Levi-Civita connection of g. Taking a cyclic permutation over X,Y,Z and using the fact that ω is closed, one gets

[formula]

With respect to the local basis verifying ([\ref=Local_structure]), the latter equality implies

[formula]

a contradiction.
