Restrictions on Information Transfer in Quantum Measurements

Introduction

Despite its significant achievements, Measurement Theory of quantum mechanics (QM) still contains some open questions concerned with its internal consistency1,2,3. The most famous and oldest of them is the State Collapse or Objectification problem, but there are also others, more subtle and less well-known4,5,6. In this paper this problem called often the Quantum Measurement problem is studied mainly within the framework of Information Theory. Really, the measurement of some system S includes the transfer of information from S to the information system O (Observer) which processes and memorizes it. In Information Theory, any measuring system (MS) can be regarded as the information transferring channel, which transfers the parameters of S state to O. Consequently, the possible restrictions on the information transfer from S to O can influence the effects observed in the measurements. In our previous paper it was shown that such restrictions are principally important for the whole picture of measurement. In particular, they induce the unavoidable stochasticity in the observed by O outcomes of measurements, which, by the all appearances, coincide with the collapse of measured state8. Our calculations of this effects exploited the formalism of Observable Algebra - C*-algebra which is most general and deep mathematical QM formulation4. However, this formalism is rather complicated and abstract, so in this paper the same calculations are reconsidered by means of standard Schr[formula]dinger QM formalism; it permits also to analyze the fundamental QM aspects more simply and straightforwardly. It supposed that the evolution of all objects, including macroscopic ones, like O, can be described by the quantum state (density matrix) ρ(t) which obeys to Schr[formula]dinger-Lioville equation in arbitrary reference frame (RF). The information-theoretical approach of system self-description or 'measurement from inside' is applied to the consistent description of information acquisition in quantum measurements7. In Schr[formula]dinger QM framework, the formalism of inference maps in Hilbert space5 responds to this approach, it applied for the calculations of information transfer from S to O.

The principal features of Schr[formula]dinger formalism, essential for our measurement formalism, can be formulated as QM eigenstates ansatz (): for any observable G of quantum finite-dimensional system Ξ there at least two Ξ (pure) states ρi for which Ξ possess the different real properties gi and they are G eigenvalues1. Remind4 that, in general, an arbitrary ρ will be G eigenstate with eigenvalue ga: G,ρ  →  ga, iff l = ()l = gla for any natural l > 0. Thus, predicts with definiteness the result of G measurements for ρi states in the individual events of measurement. All Ξ individual states, i.e. the states in particular event are pure (but can be unknown), yet the statistical (ensemble) states can be also mixed6. As shown below, the set of such Ξ eigenstates {ρGi} for various G constitutes for given Ξ the 'information' basis, which permits to derive the measurement properties of arbitrary state ρ' from its comparison with {ρGi} properties. Overall, we shall argue that together with the systems' self-description formalism of information theory permit to construct the consistent measurement formalism, without inclusion of QM Reduction Postulate. Further details concerning with the inference maps, systems' self-description, etc., can be found elsewhere6,8. Early version of this text was published in12.

Model of Quantum Measurements

Here our measurement model will be described and some aspects of QM Measurements Theory, essential for our approach, discussed at semiqualitative level. In our model MS consists of the studied system S, detector D and the information system O, which memorizes and process the information about MS current state. The effects of D, O decoherence by their environment aren't of primary importance in our theory, they will be regarded briefly in the final part of the paper. As in many other models of measurement1,10, S is taken to be the particle with the spin [formula] and the measurement of its projection Sz is regarded. Its u,d eigenstates denoted |s1,2〉, the measured S pure state is: ψs = a1|s1〉 + a2|s2〉. For the comparison, the incoming u,  d 'test' mixture with the same S̄z should be regarded also. This is S ensemble described by the gemenge1 Ws  =  {|si〉,i}, where i = |ai|2 are the probabilities of individual state |si〉 in this ensemble, its statistical state described by the density matrix:

[formula]

Analogously to S state, D state in O RF is supposedly described by Dirac vector |D〉 in two-dimensional Hilbert space HD. Its basis constitutes |D1,2〉 eigenstates of Q 'pointer' observable with eigenvalues q1,2. The initial D state is: [formula]. S, D interaction ĤS,D starts at t0 and finishes effectively at some t1; for Zurek Hamiltonian HS,D with suitable parameters it would result in S,  D entangled final state ρS,D or the corresponding state vector:

[formula]

relative to O RF. Hence the measurement of S eigenstate |s1,2〉 results in Ψ1,2 = |s1,2〉|D1,2〉, this is factorized S, D state. In case a1,2  ≠  0, D also possess the quantum state RD, but it can't be completely factorized from the entangled S, D state ΨS,D. If to neglect this entanglement, D statistical state coincides with MS partial state, obtained by tracing out S degrees of freedom from S, D state. It will be argued that the situation with individual D state ansatz is more subtle and ambiguous, but in our calculations no particular RD ansatz is used. It turns out that  = |a1|2 - |a2|2 , so D performs Sz measurement of first kind1. At t > t1 D, O interaction starts and finishes at some t2, during this interval, some information about D state is transferred to O. In this chapter O isn't described consistently as the quantum object, it will be done in chap. 3. It assumed arbitrarily that the acquisition of information by O doesn't violate QM laws. It's supposedly true for human observer also, below some terms characteristic for human perception will be used in illustrative purposes.

In Information Theory, the signal induced by the measured state and registrated by O in event n is characterized by the information pattern (IP) J(n) = {e1,...,el}, this is the array of numerical parameters, which represent the complete signal description available for O6. The difference between two individual states for O is reflected by the difference of their IPs6; if some ei are the same for all studied states, they can be omitted in J. In general, the set of all possible J constitutes the independent 'information space', which describes O recognition of measured states or signals7. In quantum case, some states parameters can be uncertain, below it will be shown that it's unimportant for the corresponding IPs and only definite ei should be regarded. Let's regard first the measurement of S eigenstate |s1,2〉, in that case, O supposedly percepts |D1,2〉 state in event n as IP:

[formula]

For final |D1,2〉 states their Q eigenvalues q1,2, which describe D pointer position are D real properties1, corresponding to the orthogonal projectors PD1,2. Hence for O the difference between this D states is the objective or Boolean Difference3 (BD). It means that this states difference is equivalent to the distinction between the logical operands Yes / No, or that's the same between the values 1 / 0 of some discrete parameter Lg available for O. Note that in QM all measurable parameters are related to the observables which represented by Hermitian Operators on H (or POV in general formalism). For example, for |D1,2〉 the parameter Lg = 1 / 0 is the eigenvalue of projector PD1. It will be argued that such strict correspondence reduces the number of feasible parameters, which can be applied for the discrimination of quantum states.

Now let's regard the possible measurement outcomes when a1,2  ≠  0, i.e. ψs is |si〉 superposition. The standard or 'Pedestrian' Interpretation2(PI) of QM claims that without the inclusion of Reduction Postulate into QM formalism, O should percept S, D entangled state ΨS,D as the superposition of IPs induced by |D1,2〉, i.e. the simultaneous coexistence of two IP JD1 and JD2. This hypothesis is the essence of famous 'Schr[formula]dinger Cat' Paradox3. More realistically, one can expect at least that IP Js, induced by ΨS,D, would differ for O from JD1,2. Yet the situation isn't so simple and doesn't favor such prompt jump to the conclusions. Really, given PI implications are correct, O should distinguish in a single event ΨS,D, i.e. the corresponding D state RD from each |D1,2〉. Hence the relation of corresponding O IPs should be characterized by BD, i. e. for ΨS,D the corresponding Js  ≠  JD1,2. Hence it should be at least one measurable D parameter GD which value g0 for ΨS,D is different from its values g1,2 for |D1,2〉. To verify this hypothesis for ΨS,D and |D1,2〉, one should check the set (algebra) of D PV observables {GD} as possible candidates (the role of joint S,  D observables regarded below). The simple check shows that no D observable also can satisfy to this demands; POV generalization of this ansatz will be discussed below, but it doesn't change this conclusion. Really, suppose that such GD - Hermitian operator exists, then it follows:

[formula]

As easy to see, for D observables such equality fulfilled only for GD = I. It can be shown that any nontrivial GD with such properties can respond only to the nonlinear operator on HD, hence the observation of such difference is incompatible with standard QM formalism. Consequently, it's impossible for O to distinguish |Di〉 from RD i.e. from ΨS,D of ([\ref=AA2]) in a single event. Meanwhile, for S ensemble one can expect that the correct [formula] is obtained by O in S detection, to fulfill this condition, O should observe the stochastic q1,2 outcomes with probabilities 1,2. This considerations put doubts on the necessity of independent Reduction Postulate in QM, the similar hypothesis was proposed first by Wigner9 from the considerations of quantum measurements and consequent information aquisition by human observer. To give more arguments in favor of our theory, it's instructive to consider in detail the possible influence of O quantum properties on the measurement picture. Note that the obtained results don't mean that RD is the probabilistic mixture of |D1,2〉, rather RD can be characterized as their 'weak' superposition, induced by the entanglement of S, D states.

Quantum Measurements and System Self-description

Now the information system O will be regarded as the quantum object also, so MS is described by a quantum state ρMS relative to some other RF O'. We shall regard O with the same internal structure as D posess: O pure state is a vector in two-dimensional Hilbert space HO. Analogously to D, we settle O initial state [formula], where |O1,2〉 are eigenstates of O 'internal pointer' observable QO with eigenvalues qO1,2. For suitable D, O Hamiltonian HD,O one can obtain at t > t2:

[formula]

As easy to see, D states only double S states for this set-up, so D can be dropped for the simplicity. In such scheme S directly interacts with O by means of Hamiltonian HS,O, resulting in the final state ρMS and correponding state vector:

[formula]

relative to some external RF O'. Our aim is to find find the relation between this state and the information acquired by O, which is quite intricate problem. In Information Theory, the measurement of parameters of arbitrary system S' by an information system OI is the mapping of S' states set NS to the set NO of OI internal states6. In general case, which is generic for QM, the information acquisition by OI can be described by the formalism of systems' self-description7. In its framework, OI considered as the subsystem of larger system ΞT = S',OI with the states set NT. This approach gives the most fundamental and mathematically self-consistent description of the information transfer in arbitrary S' measurement called 'measurement from inside'. In this case, the information acquired by OI about the surrounding objects and OI itself described by OI internal state RO called also ΞT restricted state or restriction. For given ΞT system RO is defined by the inference map MO of ΞT state to NO set, in general, MO should be derived from the first QM principles. The internal OI state RO corresponds to OI internal degrees of freedom, which, in principle, can 'record' the incoming information. For example, if OI is the atom, RO would describe the state of its electron shells, which are the functions of the relative coordinates of electrons and nucleus. The important property of inference map MO is formulated by Breuer Theorem: if for two arbitrary ΞT states Γ,Γ' their restricted states R,R' coincide, then for OI this ΞT states are indistinguishable, and for any nontrivial S',OI at least one such pair of states exist 5. In classical case, the origin of this effect is obvious: OI has less degrees of freedom than ΞT and hence can't discriminate all possible ΞT states7. In quantum case, the entanglement and nonlocality play the additional important role in this effect and make its description more complicated. Despite that RO are incomplete ΞT states, they are the real physical states for OI observer - 'the states in their own right', as Breuer characterizes them. as will be argued, in this approach the information acquired by O also expressed by IP J, main features of IPs described in chap. 2, conserved also for RO states8.

The mapping relations between S',OI, ΞT states are applicable to MS measurement model which can be also treated as 'measurement from inside' . However, Schr[formula]dinger QM dynamics by itself doesn't permit to derive the inference map MO(ΞT  →  OI) unambiguously, it needs more detailed development of formalism described below. Breuer attempted to avoid this ambiguity phenomenologically, assuming that for arbitrary ΞT its restricted state is equal to the partial trace of ΞT individual state over S', i.e. RO is ΞT partial state on OI. In our set-up for MS pure state ΨMS of (3) it gives:

[formula]

Plainly, such ansatz excludes beforehand any kind of stochastic RO behavior, and this is natural for Schr[formula]dinger formalism. For MS mixed ensemble, induced by incoming Ws ensemble of (1), the individual MS state differs from event to event:

[formula]

where the frequencies of random l(n) appearance in given event n are stipulated by the probabilistic distribution Pl = |al|2. In this approach O restricted state for this mixed ensemble is also stochastic: in a given event

[formula]

where ξOi = |Oi〉〈Oi| appears with the corresponding probability i, so that the ensemble of O states described by the gemenge WOmix  =  {ξOi,i}. RmixO(n) differs formally from RBO in any event n, hence for the restricted O individual states the main condition of cited theorem is violated. From that Breuer concluded that O can discriminate the individual pure/mixed MS states 'from inside', therefore, O can discriminate the individual pure and mixed S states, it supposedly means that the collapse of pure state doesn't occur5.

However, we find that the structure of MS observables set (algebra) together with Schr[formula]dinger dynamics permit to calculate MS restriction to O unambiguously, and the obtained results contradict to Breuer conclusion. Consider the measurement of S eigenstate |si〉, it produces MS individual ςMS states, which restriction are ξO1,2 states with eigenvalues qO1,2. One can expect that O identifies this states as IP:

[formula]

Really, the difference between ξOi states is boolean (classical), because their mutual relation expressed as: 〈Oi|Oj〉  =  δij, and according to Segal theorem, it corresponds to the relation between the classical discrete states defined on QO axe4. In addition, in QM formalism ξOi eigenvalues qOi are O real properties, so this hypothesis seems to be well founded. The proposed correspondence ξOi  →  JOi is quite important for our theory, because it establishes the connection (mapping) between some O quantum states and classical IP set {J}. Generally speaking, this set is the principally different entity from any space of dynamical states, both quantum and classical, since its elements J describe the results of O identification of incoming signals7.

Now we shall use the obtained IP ansatz for the consideration of state collapse, in particular, we shall reconsider Breuer conclusions. Note that the formal difference of two restricted states doesn't mean automatically that their difference will be detected by O. Such difference is the necessary but not sufficient condition, there should be also some particular effect available for O observation, which indicate this difference. For ξOi this are the eigenvalues qOi of observable QO, resulting in BD of ξO1,2 for O and described by IP JO1,2. Analogously, one should explore whether some discriminating effect observed by O can indicate RO and ξOi difference. The check of this hypothesis can be performed analogously to the ansatz described by formulae ([\ref=E1]), but for the completeness of our proof it's instructive to use the alternative operator methods. Suppose that RO  ≠  ξO1,2 for O in BD sense, so that their relation should be expressed also by some O parameter g with the values g0  ≠  g1,2, correspondingly. In QM formalism, such parameter g, if it exists, should correspond to some O observable GO. It should be such O PV observable GO, for which RO,ξOi are its eigenstates with projectors PR, POi and eigenvalues g0,  gi, such that g0  ≠  gi. From Spectral Theorem3 an arbitrary Hermitian operator GO, for which RO,ξOi are eigenstates, admits the orthogonal decomposition:

[formula]

here G' is an arbitrary operator for which G'POi = 0, G'PR = 0; it should be also PRPOi = 0. But POi constitute the complete algebra of projectors in HO corresponding to the orthogonal unit decomposition: [formula], and so:

[formula]

Hence RO can't possess the independent projector in HO and such nontrivial GO doesn't exist. From the correspondence between the states and their projectors follows that RBO of (5) isn't proper ansatz for ΨMS restriction RO, the only solution is to accept that in any event PR = POi and correspondingly:

[formula]

i.e. it coincides with RmixO as the individual state.

For pure MS ensemble the expectation value lO for any natural l can be calculated without the use of Reduction Postulate from Graham-Hartle theorem11, based on quite loose assumptions. To reproduce this lO values, O should observe the collapse of pure MS state to one of qOi at random with probability i = |ai|2, i.e. the ensemble of O states described by the gemenge WO  =  {ξOi,i}. It induces the corresponding O IP ensemble ZO  =  {JOi,i}. Eventually, the inference map MO for ΨMS  →  RO restriction is stochastic, we don't present here MO ansatz in the analytical form, which can be easily derived from the previous calculations but is rather tedious. Our studies show that POV generalization of standard QM PV observables don't change our conclusions. The reason of it is that POV parameters respond to the nonorthogonal unit decomposition, yet BD can exist only between mutually orthogonal states, hence it can be shown that there is no O POV observable which responds to BD between RO and ξOi. In the regarded case, only the parameters corresponding to nonlinear operators can establish BD between this states.

Thus, our assumption about the role of information constraints in state collapse is proved formally, here we shall discuss in more qualitative terms the physical mechanism of such stochasticity in the measurements, because it presents the significant interest for the study of QM foundations. Remind that in QM formalism two kinds of uncertainties exist: suppose that for some state ρ the value [formula] of observable G lays in the interval gmin  ≤    ≤  gmax, Then, depending on ρ, it can be either the stochastic value, i.e. objectively  = gi with some probability P'i, if ρ is a mixed state, or it can be truly uncertain (fuzzy) value [formula] for pure ρ. The difference between this two states revealed by 'interference term' (IT) observables, which demonstrate the presence of [formula] superposition. For MS entangled states no O observables are sensitive to it, it can be only joint S,O observables BMS. As the example, consider the symmetric IT for MS:

[formula]

Being measured by external RF O' via its interaction with S, O, it gives  = 0 for any |si〉 incoming mixture, but   ≠  0 for entangled MS states of (4). For example, for the incoming symmetric S state ψss with [formula], the corresponding ΨsMS is B eigenstate with eigenvalue b1 = 1. However, B value can't be directly measured by O 'from inside', at least simultaneously with Sz, because they don't commute5. In addition, when S,O interaction finishes, S can become free particle again, and so the joint S,O observables can become unavailable for O in a short time. From the same reasons the whole set of IT observables {BMS} is unavailable for O during Sz measurement, but only some O internal observables. Note that, in general, the pure/mixed MS states with the same O can be discriminated only statistically, since their distributions of B values (or other BMS) overlap. Namely, for ΨsMS the probability PB(b1,2) = .5 for such mixture, so its b distribution intersects largely with b distribution for B eigenstate ΨsMS. Consequently, even O' can't discriminate the pure/mixed MS states in a single event, but only statistically for MS ensemble with N  →    ∞  . Overall, it follows from this analysis that no IT observables are available for O, and so one can expect that O can't discriminate the pure and mixed O states, for which qO is 'smeared' inside the same uncertainty interval. Yet we know that ROmix ensemble WOmix can reproduce the same lO values as ΨMS ensemble. Because of this reasons, RO ensemble WO should coincide with the mixed ensemble WOmix. Consequently, for ΨMS the genuine q0 uncertainty can be released in O RF only in the form of q0 randomness inside its uncertainty interval {qO1,qO2}. Roughly speaking, ΨMS induces O signal, which in each event put some income into the resulting lO value, so that their ensemble should produce the proper lO values. But it turns out that such signal can be only stochastic, no ensemble of identical signals with demanded properties exist. It seems that our results constitute the kind of no-go theorem for the observation of |si〉 superpositions by O.

It's well known that the decoherence of pure states by its environment E is the important effect in quantum measurements1,2,10, we find yet that O decoherence by E doesn't play the principal role in our theory. However, its account stabilizes the described collapse mechanism additionally and defines unambiguously the preferred basis PB of O stable final states {ξOi} exploited here. Really, for the specially chosen Hamiltonian of O,E interaction10, one obtains that MS,E final state is:

[formula]

where Ej are E elements, NE is Ej total number. As easy to demonstrate, if an arbitrary O pure state ΨO is produced, it will also qecohere in a very short time into the analogous |Oi〉 combinations, entangled with E, so that O can practically percept only |Oi〉 final states. Such O PB can be derived from other more subtle arguments, yet O decoherence even for quite small NE  ~  2  ÷  4 already defines it effectively.

We conclude that standard Schr[formula]dinger QM formalism together with the theory of quantum systems' self-description permit to obtain the collapse of the measured pure state without implementation of independent Reduction Postulate into QM axiomatics. As was shown, in this approach the main source of stochasticity is the principal constraint on the transfer of specific information in S    →  O information channel. This information, unavailable for O, characterizes the purity of S state8, because of it, O can't discriminate the pure/mixed S states. As the result of this information incompleteness, the stochasticity of measurement outcomes appear, which is the analog of fundamental 'white noise'.. In addition, the formalism of systems' self-description permits to resolve also the old problem of Heisenberg cut in quantum measurements, by the inclusion of the information system into quantum formalism properly and on equal terms with other MS elements9. Of course, the most exciting and controversial question is whether this theory is applicable to the observations made by human observer O, in particular, whether IP J describes the true O 'impressions' about their outcomes ? This is open problem, but since our theory is based on standard QM premises, and at the microscopic level the human brain should obey QM laws, we believe that the answer can be positive. Note that in our theory the brain or any other processor plays only the passive role of signal receiver, the real effect of information loss, essential for collapse, occurs 'on the way', when the quantum signal passes through the information channel. The interesting feature of this theory is that the same MS state can be stochastic in O RF, but evolve linearly in O' RF. In particular, ΨMS restriction to O in O RF is stochastic state RO of (9), yet in O' RF O partial state is RBO of (4), i.e. is the 'weak superposition'. The detailed explanation of this effect is given by the unitarily nonequivalent representations admitted in Algebraic QM8. Here we notice only that O and O' deal with different sets of MS observables, and so the transformation of MS state between them can be nonunitary. Obtained results agree well with our calculation in C* Algebras formalism8, in that approach the inference map MO is the operator restriction of MS observable algebra to O (sub)algebra.
