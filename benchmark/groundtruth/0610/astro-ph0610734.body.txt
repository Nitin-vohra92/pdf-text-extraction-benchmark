Matter instability in modified gravity

Analyses of type Ia supernovae [\cite=SN] and of the cosmic microwave background, including the 3-year WMAP results [\cite=WMAP3], confirm that the present expansion of the universe is accelerated. This is currently explained by invoking a form of dark energy comprising 70% of the total cosmic energy density ρ and with exotic properties (it does not cluster at small scales and has negative pressure Pde≃  -  ρde). Recently, as an alternative to this exotic dark energy, it has been proposed to explain the cosmic acceleration with geometry by modifying Einstein gravity at the largest scales (or at low curvatures) by introducing corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian ("f(R)", or "fourth order", or "modified" gravity). The simplest form for the action of modified gravity is

[formula]

where [formula], R is the Ricci curvature [\cite=footnoteadded], and S(m) is the matter action. One can vary the action with respect to the metric ("metric formalism") or perform a Palatini variation in which the metric and the connection are treated as independent variables [\cite=Palatini] ("Palatini formalism")--the resulting field equations, which coincide in general relativity, are different in higher order gravity. Furthermore, if the matter action S(m) also depends on the connection, one obtains a third possibility, metric-affine gravity theories [\cite=LiberatiSotiriou].

Quadratic quantum corrections were originally introduced to improve the renormalizability of general relativity [\cite=renorma] and were used to achieve inflation in the early universe [\cite=Starobinsky]. There is also motivation for modified gravity from string/M theory [\cite=stringmotivations].

The field equations obtained by varying the action ([\ref=1]) in the metric formalism are

[formula]

where a prime denotes differentiation with respect to R, gab and Rab are the metric and Ricci tensors, and Tab is the stress-energy tensor of ordinary matter. The idea of modified gravity consists in introducing corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert action that are negligible in the early universe and only become effective at late times when the Ricci curvature R decreases (the radiation era with R = 0 deserves a special discussion -- see below). The prototype is the theory f(R) = R - μ4 / R [\cite=MG1] [\cite=CDTT] [\cite=oneoverR] which, however, was found to be unstable [\cite=DolgovKawasaki] [\cite=Odintsovconfirm]. Therefore, we parametrize the deviations from Einstein gravity as

[formula]

where ε is a small parameter with the dimensions of an inverse squared length and φ is arranged to be dimensionless (in the previous example with f = R - μ4 / R it is ε =  - μ4 with μ≃H0  ≈  10- 33 eV, the present value of the Hubble parameter H). In order for the effects of these corrections to appear only at recent times a sensible choice is ε  ≈  H20≃10- 66  2, which amounts to some fine-tuning which is present in all these theories, as well as in dark energy models. At present there is little indication on what the correct modification of Einstein gravity should be and it would be useful to weed out some of the competing models. Besides compatibility with experimental data (e.g., [\cite=Menaetal]), minimal criteria that a modified gravity theory must satisfy in order to be viable are the following: 1) reproducing the desired dynamics of the universe including an inflationary era, followed by a radiation era (required and well-constrained by primordial baryogenesis and nucleosynthesis [\cite=LambiaseScarpetta] and a matter era (required for the formation of structures) and, finally, by the present acceleration epoch (constrained by cosmic microwave background experiments, supernova data, and large scale structure surveys). There is recent evidence [\cite=AmendolaPolarskiTsujikawa] (see also [\cite=Amendolacomments]) that the popular models f(R) = R - μ2(n + 1) / Rn with μ,n > 0 [\cite=MG1] [\cite=CDTT] [\cite=oneoverR] do not allow a matter-dominated era and are therefore ruled out. 2) Having Newtonian and post-Newtonian limits compatible with the available Solar System experiments. This issue is not settled in general, there are conflicting results on the weak-field limit of modified gravity in specific scenarios, and we still lack a general formalism applicable to all modified gravity models [\cite=PPN] [\cite=IgnacioKarel] [\cite=veto]. 3) The theory must be stable at the classical and quantum level. There are in principle several kinds of instabilities to consider [\cite=instabilities]. Dolgov and Kawasaki [\cite=DolgovKawasaki] discovered an instability in the matter sector for the specific model f(R) = R - μ4 / R, a result confirmed in Ref. [\cite=Odintsovconfirm], in which it is also shown that adding a term quadratic in R removes the instability. Instabilities of de Sitter space in the gravity sector were found in Refs. [\cite=mypapers] [\cite=DolgovPelliccia] [\cite=BarrowHervik] [\cite=MullerSchmidtStarobinsky], while stability with respect to black hole nucleation was studied in Refs. [\cite=Cognolaetal]. The consideration of physically different instabilities yields remarkably similar stability conditions. The theory should also be ghost-free: the presence of ghosts has been studied in Refs. [\cite=IgnacioKarel]. In this communication we focus on the Dolgow-Kawasaki instability and generalize their analysis to arbitrary f(R) theories.

By taking the trace of eq. ([\ref=1bis]) one obtains

[formula]

By evaluating [formula] this equation is written as

[formula]

We assume that the second derivative φ'' is different from zero; if φ'' = 0 on an interval then the theory reduces to general relativity and is not of interest here. Isolated zeros of φ'' (at which the theory is "instantaneously general relativity") are not dealt with in this paper, but they are generally allowed and the following discussion applies to the distinct regions in which φ'' maintains its sign.

We now follow the procedure of Ref. [\cite=DolgovKawasaki] and consider a small region of spacetime in the weak-field regime, in which the metric and the curvature can locally be approximated by

[formula]

where ηab is the Minkowski metric and [formula]. This inequality excludes the case of conformally invariant matter with T = 0, including the important case of a radiation fluid with equation of state P = ρ / 3 -- this situation is examined later. Equation ([\ref=4]) yields, to first order in R1,

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] denote the gradient and Laplacian operators in Euclidean three-dimensional space, respectively, and an overdot denotes differentiation with respect to time. The function φ and its derivatives are now evaluated at R =  - κ  T. The coefficient of R1 in the fifth term on the left hand side is the square of an effective mass and is dominated by the term [formula] due to the extremely small value of ε needed for these theories to reproduce the correct cosmological dynamics. It is therefore obvious that the theory will be stable if φ'' = f'' > 0, while an instability arises if this effective mass is negative, i.e., if φ'' = f'' < 0. The time scale for this instability to manifest is estimated to be of order 10- 26 s for the specific case φ(R) =  - μ4 / R [\cite=DolgovKawasaki]. As shown by this example, the smallness of φ'' contributes to the magnitude of the effective mass and the smallness of the characteristic time scale for the instability to develop. Although a φ'' term also appears in the denominator of the last source term on the right hand side of eq. ([\ref=5]), it is partially offset by the presence of φ and φ' in the numerator, while this does not occurs for the dominant term in the effective mass of R1.

Let us consider as an example the model [formula] with μ > 0 and n > 0 (n is not restricted to be an integer): since [formula] this theory always suffers from the Dolgov-Kawasaki instability. Instead, the theory [formula] (again with μ,n > 0) is stable (but the required cosmological dynamics may not be achieved). As another example consider f(R) = R + Λ  +  αRn with n > 0 and Λ > 0 a cosmological constant, corresponding to Starobinsky inflation in the early universe [\cite=Starobinsky]. The R2 correction to the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian is large during this early epoch and the contribution of matter to the dynamics is negligible; any instability could in principle be interesting, and f'' = nαRn - 2 > 0 if α > 0, corresponding to stability.

We can now consider the case of a radiation fluid or other form of matter with vanishing trace T of the stress-energy tensor. In this case eq. ([\ref=5]) becomes

[formula]

Again, the effective mass term is [formula], which has the sign of f'' and the previous stability criterion is recovered [\cite=footnoten].

One could think of using an independent approach and study the equilibrium non-perturbatively by taking advantage of the dynamical equivalence between f(R) gravity and a scalar-tensor theory. By introducing the auxiliary field φ, the action ([\ref=1]) can be rewritten as

[formula]

when f''  ≠  0, where

[formula]

The corresponding field equations are

[formula]

[formula]

The action ([\ref=13]) reduces to ([\ref=1]) trivially if φ = R and, vice-versa, variation of ([\ref=13]) with respect to φ yields φ = R if f''  ≠  0. Now one may think of studying the stability of the model by looking at the shape and extrema of the effective potential V(φ) but this would be misleading. In fact, the dynamics of φ are not regulated by V but are fixed by the strong constraint φ = R. By taking the trace of eq. ([\ref=15]) and using eq. ([\ref=14]), one obtains again eq. ([\ref=2]). Equation ([\ref=16]) for φ has no dynamical content because, using eq. ([\ref=14]) with φ = R, it is identically satisfied. This is linked to the fact that the kinetic term for φ is absent in the action ([\ref=13]) with Brans-Dicke parameter ω = 0 and the dynamical equation for φ degenerates into an identity. Similar considerations apply to the Palatini action, which is equivalent to a Brans-Dicke theory with parameter ω =  - 3 / 2.

In conjunction with the other theoretical requirements listed above, the (in)stability condition derived here constitutes a useful criterion to veto some of the proposed f(R) gravity scenarios from a theoretician's point of view, in order to focus on more promising models.

Note that, when f'' < 0, the instability of these theories can be interpreted, following eq. ([\ref=5]), as an instability in the gravity sector. Equivalently, by using eq. ([\ref=4]), it can be seen as a matter instability (this is the interpretation taken in [\cite=DolgovKawasaki]). Whether the instability arises in the gravity or matter sector seems to be a matter of interpretation.

A problem potentially related to the instability is the weak-field limit of f(R) gravity, which has been the subject of several papers reporting conflicting (sometimes even opposite) results [\cite=PPN] [\cite=IgnacioKarel] [\cite=veto]. We hope to report soon on this issue and its relation with local instability.

Finally, we mention the issue of the Cauchy problem: a well posed Cauchy problem is necessary if the theory is to have predictive power [\cite=Wald]. It was shown in Ref. [\cite=Noakes], using harmonic coordinates, that theories of the form

[formula]

have a well posed initial value problem. Moreover, the existence of a well posed Cauchy problem can be reduced to the analogous problem by using the dynamical equivalence with scalar-tensor gravity ([\ref=13]) and ([\ref=14]) when f''  ≠  0. The well posedness of the Cauchy problem was demonstrated for particular scalar-tensor theories in Refs. [\cite=CockeCohen] [\cite=Noakes] and has recently been the subject of a thorough analysis [\cite=Salgado]. Although further study is needed for the specific cases ω = 0 and ω =  - 3 / 2, which are relevant for f(R) gravity in the metric and Palatini formalism, respectively, it seems that the Cauchy problem is well posed [\cite=Salgado]. Details on this subject will be presented elsewhere.
