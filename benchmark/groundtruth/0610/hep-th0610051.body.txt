On cosmic natural selection

One of the fundamental questions in physics is why the constants of nature have their observed values. This question becomes even more intriguing if we observe that the constants appear to be tuned for the existence of life. This can be explained in the context of multiverse models, where the constants vary from one place in the universe to another. The observed values are then determined partly by chance and partly by anthropic selection (for an up to date discussion, see [\cite=Carr]).

An alternative explanation, suggested by Lee Smolin, is "cosmic natural selection" [\cite=Smolin1] [\cite=Smolinbook] [\cite=Smolin2]. Smolin assumes that every time a black hole is formed, a new, causally disconnected universe is created behind its horizon. The constants of nature in this daughter universe are assumed to be slightly different from those in the original one. Smolin claims that this "reproduction" of universes leads to an ensemble dominated by universes producing the largest possible number of black holes. Furthermore, he claims that the conditions maximizing the formation of massive stars turning into black holes are about the same as the condition needed for the evolution of carbon-based life. This explains the apparent fine-tuning of the constants.

Smolin points out that his theory would be falsified if black hole production were shown to increase when the constants of nature are varied from their present values. He has repeatedly challenged the physics community to refute his theory and maintains that, despite several attempts [\cite=Ellis] [\cite=Harrison] [\cite=Silk] [\cite=Susskind2], it has not yet been falsified. Recently, there has been much discussion of Smolin's ideas, especially in the popular press. In this note, I will argue that black hole production can be enhanced by an increase in the value of the cosmological constant, thus falsifying Smolin's conjecture.

The simplest interpretation of the observed accelerated expansion of the universe is that it is driven by a constant vacuum energy density, which is about 3 times greater than the density of nonrelativistic matter. Ordinary matter is being diluted, while the vacuum energy density remains the same, and in another 10 billion years or so the universe will be completely dominated by the vacuum. The following evolution of the universe is accurately described by de Sitter space. One might think that no new black holes will be formed in such a universe, but this is not the case.

It has been shown by Gibbons and Hawking [\cite=GH] that the state of quantum fields in de Sitter space is similar to a thermal state with a characteristic temperature

is the de Sitter expansion rate, Λ is the cosmological constant, which is related to the vacuum energy density as Λ = 8πρv, and I am using Planck units in which the Planck mass is mP = 1. (In these units, the present Hubble expansion rate is H  ~  10- 61.) Quantum fluctuations of geometry will result in occasional formation of black holes. This is a quantum tunneling process, which is mathematically described by an instanton - a solution of Euclideanized Einstein's equations.

One might be skeptical that we can say something definite about a quantum process involving gravity, since we do not have a full theory of quantum gravity. However, the instanton description of tunneling is based on semiclassical gravity, which only requires the knowledge of classical field equations and is generally believed to be reliable.

The semiclassical nucleation rate of black holes per unit volume per unit time, Γ, has been calculated by Ginsparg and Perry [\cite=Perry], Chao [\cite=Chao], and by Bousso and Hawking [\cite=Bousso]. For black holes of mass M  ≪  H- 1, it is given by [\cite=Chao] [\cite=Bousso]

[formula]

as might be expected. The rate decreases with M and reaches the minimum value for the largest black holes that can fit in de Sitter space, having their Schwarzschild radius equal to the de Sitter horizon. The mass of such black holes is M  ~  H- 1, and their nucleation rate is [\cite=Perry]

[formula]

Since de Sitter space is eternal to the future, the total number of created black holes is infinite. It is not clear then how the numbers of black holes produced in different universes are to be compared. This appears to be a serious difficulty, similar to the measure problem of eternal inflation [\cite=LLM] [\cite=GSPVW], but for the time being it seems natural to assume that the maximum of probability corresponds to the highest rate of black hole production. According to Eqs. ([\ref=Gamma]),([\ref=Gammamin]), the rate grows exponentially with Λ and approaches one black hole per Planck volume per Planck time as Λ gets close to the Planck scale (Λ  ~  1). At that point semiclassical gravity becomes unreliable, and Eq.([\ref=Gamma]) cannot be extended to [formula].

If, for some reason, one does not trust semiclassical gravity, one can argue on general grounds that quantum fluctuations resulting in a local increase of energy density and leading to black hole formation do not violate any conservation laws and should therefore have a nonzero probability. Even if one insists that universes can be created only in black holes resulting from stellar collapse, suitable stars will pop out as quantum fluctuations in de Sitter space at a nonzero rate (assuming that the radius of the star is much smaller than the de Sitter horizon). Quantum fluctuations generally get stronger when Λ is increased (since the effective de Sitter temperature gets higher). Thus, black hole production should increase with increase of Λ [\cite=foot1].

For the observed value of Λ, the nucleation rate ([\ref=Gamma]) is extremely small. With [formula], Eq. ([\ref=Gamma]) gives [formula] [\cite=foot2]. And yet this process dominates over any black holes that have been or will be produced by stellar collapse, since the number of nucleated black holes is infinite. A slight increase in Λ would enhance the nucleation rate, thus falsifying Smolin's conjecture.

One caveat is that the observed dark energy may not be a true cosmological constant and may be gradually decreasing with time, approaching zero or even a negative value. Then the de Sitter expansion may stop before any black holes had a chance to nucleate. But even if the true vacuum energy is constrained to be zero or negative, a vacuum dominated stage can be achieved by varying the parameters of the Higgs potential, so that a high-energy vacuum state becomes metastable with a suffucuently long lifetime. A metastable vacuum will decay through bubble formation, but if the bubble nucleation rate satisfies

[formula]

the volume occupied by the false vacuum will grow exponentially with time [\cite=Guth] and an infinite number of black holes will be produced. It is hard to imagine a realistic broken-symmetry theory of elementary particles whose parameters cannot be adjusted to arrange a metastable high-energy vacuum. An enormous number of such vacua is suggested in string theory [\cite=KKLM] [\cite=Susskind].

I would like to conclude with a general remark. One of the objections Smolin raised against anthropic predictions is that they rely on the principle of mediocrity, while there is no guarantee that our civilization is typical [\cite=Smolin2]. The same criticism, however, can be applied to natural selection. The natural selection model does not fix the constants precisely; it only gives a probability distribution. The constants of nature may be far away from the peak of the distribution in some rare universes, so no prediction can be made unless one assumes that our universe is typical. (This point has been recently emphasized by Vaas [\cite=Vaas].)
