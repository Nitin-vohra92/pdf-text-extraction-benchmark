Introduction

At the Solvay Conference in 1911, Einstein answered a question raised by Lorentz with the statement 'If the length of a pendulum is changed infinitely slowly, its energy remains equal to hν if it was originally hν'. The expression 'adiabatic invariant' came to be used in this context, and this has stuck over the years, even though the change of the system has to be slow, rather than adiabatic in the thermodynamic sense and the quantity in question is not invariant -- and indeed may not even change very slowly, as will be discussed further.

Adiabatic invariance is readily understandable at a superficial level: students studying classical mechanics have no difficulty with the idea that, for a simple pendulum, the quantity E / ω changes very slowly in some sense when the frequency ω is slowly varied. However, the details are often found more elusive, and with good reason: the concept is fundamentally subtle and the proof of invariance is genuinely difficult. The treatment given in most texts relies on the theory of action-angle variables, which already involves a significant level of sophistication; and in addition some form of averaging is usually required. Moreover, many texts are careless of details, omit to state exactly what is being done and do not reveal the motivation for doing what is done. There is a danger too, always present when canonical transformations are used, of losing track of the relation between the dependent and independent variables.

We confine our attention to the case of a one-dimensional system governed by a Hamiltonian

[formula]

where λ is slowly varying in a sense that we will define precisely in section [\ref=sect:proof]. The quantity I defined by

[formula]

is an adiabatic invariant of this system. The integral is to be taken round the curve (assumed to be closed) in phase space given by H(p,q,λ) = E at constant λ. It represents the area inside the curve. It is important to realize that this integral is a purely geometrical construction; it takes no account of the time evolution of the system.

It is always a good idea to have in mind the example of the time-varying simple harmonic oscillator with Hamiltonian H(p,q,ω) given by

[formula]

For this system, we may easily calculate the integral in ([\ref=areaintegral]) to obtain I = E / ω, with the implication that to a good approximation the energy will change proportionally to the frequency.

For many simple systems, it is not even necessary to calculate the integral. For example, in the case H = (p2  +  λq4) / 2, we have

[formula]

from which we see that I is a numerical multiple of [formula] and that in this case to good approximation the energy varies as [formula] for slowly varying changes in λ.

Of course, I is not in general exactly invariant. It is necessary therefore to give a precise definition of adiabatic invariance. Clearly, any quantity such as I (which is essentially an average over a cycle) will vary slowly, since the system varies slowly. In order for I to be adiabatic, it must vary more slowly, in some sense than λ varies and this means that a proof of adiabatic invariance must keep careful track of any error terms.

In the next section, we illustrate some of the features of I by examining a particular adiabatic variation of the harmonic oscillator. In the third section we discuss strategies for differentiating I in order to determine its rate of change. In the fourth section we revisit the harmonic oscillator problem, in this case we consider a general adiabatic variation and present a new proof of the adiabatic invariance of I. In the fifth section, we show how this proof can be applied to more general systems. Finally in section 6 we summarize our discussion and present our conclusions.

The time dependence of I: harmonic oscillator case

In some cases, it is possible to investigate the time dependence of I by solving Hamilton's equations and evaluating the area integral ([\ref=areaintegral]) explicitly. It is instructive to look at the simplest case of the simple harmonic oscillator ([\ref=oscillatorhamiltonian]) with

[formula]

This could be regarded as the approximation, by Taylor series, to a more general slowly-varying ω(t), but for present purposes that would sacrifice clarity to little purpose: it would entail keeping track of an additional set of error terms and the calculations are messy enough in the special case. For similar reasons we will restrict attention to ε > 0. The final expressions would look better if we had set ω2  =  ω20(1 + εt), but the necessary factors can easily be inserted at the end on dimensional considerations.

We will solve Hamilton's equations explicitly for this system in terms of Airy functions, then calculate the value of I(t) using standard asymptotic expansions for the Airy functions.

Hamilton's equations are [formula], [formula], leading to

[formula]

Setting z =   -  ε- 2 / 3(1 + εt) reduces this to the Airy equation q'' - zq = 0 with solutions [formula] and [formula] (see [\cite=Abram] for details). Making use of the fact that the Wronskian of [formula] and [formula] is π- 1, we can write the solution that satisfies q = 0 and [formula] at t = 0 in the form

[formula]

For ε  ≪  1 and [formula], we can apply the standard asymptotic approximations to obtain

[formula]

where

[formula]

Note that θ, which arises naturally from the asymptotic expressions, is well behaved in the limit [formula]. We can now determine the time dependence of I:

[formula]

From this result, we can make two important observations:

The time rate of change of I(t) is not smaller than that of the Hamiltonian; both are first order in the small parameter ε;

I(t) does not grow at a rate proportional to ε; rather, it oscillates and the time-average does not contain a term proportional to ε.

The time dependence of I: general case

In order to evaluate the integral ([\ref=areaintegral]), we can in principle solve the equation H(p,q,t)  =  E at any fixed time t, to obtain a solution of the form p = P(E,q,t). Of course, in practice the appropriate value of E at time t can be obtained explicitly only by solving Hamilton's equations for the system with appropriate initial conditions, obtaining a trajectory in phase space of the from p = P(t), q = Q(t) and setting E(t) = H(P(t),Q(t),t).

At this point, it is instructive to analyse a calculation that is used the basis of the proof of adiabatic invariance in a number of standard text books. We start by differentiating under the integral sign:

[formula]

This seems to be a good result, but as it stands here it is wrong. The step that is incorrect depends on how the integral is to be interpreted and three different interpretations can be found. It should be said that the proofs of adiabatic invariance normally include some sort of averaging which can obfuscate the deficiencies of the above argument.

If the integral is interpreted as being taken round the closed curve H(p,q,t)  =  E (which is how such integrals will be defined in this paper), then equation ([\ref=steptwo]) is wrong: the identity dE / dt  =  ∂H / ∂t follows from Hamilton's equations and Hamilton's equations for the trajectory of the system whose rate of change of energy is dE / dt do not hold on the closed curve. Instead, dE / dt = 0 on this curve, which leads to a rather unhelpful integral.

If instead the path of integration is along the trajectory of the system between points at which q = 0 (say), then the curve is not closed and attention would have to be paid to the variation of the endpoints in equation ([\ref=stepone]); to put it another way, the differentiation cannot simply be taken under the integral sign. As a complicating factor in this case, the integral we are differentiating is not equal to I, and extra error terms need to be included to account for this discrepancy.

Finally, if the path of integration is the closed curve E = H(p,q,t) at a fixed time t and then each point on the curve moves along the Hamiltonian flow to obtain a closed curve at later times, then the rate of change of the integral is indeed identically zero (by Liouville's theorem) but the later curve is no longer of the form E = H(p,q,t) (for example, it does not remain elliptical in the case of the harmonic oscillator).

The remaining equations are standard results: ([\ref=stepthree]) comes from differentiating E = H(P(E,q,t),q,t) partially with respect to E and ([\ref=stepfour]) comes from differentiating this same equation partially with respect to t.

Although we do not use the above calculation explicitly in the proof of adiabatic invariance of I, it does provide a useful idea that underlies our method of proof. It is relatively easy to calculate I in any given case, but it is not at all easy to determine its time dependence. Conversely, there are quantities defined by integrals closely related to I which are not easy to calculate, but the time-dependence of which can be determined. The underlying idea of our proof is to define a quantity J that can be shown to be close to I and whose time dependence can be determined.

Adiabatic invariance of I: the harmonic oscillator case

The proof of the adiabatic invariance of I for a general Hamiltonian presented in the next section is quite difficult to understand at first because of the number of changes of variable and the different independent variables used. This is a problem common to all such proofs. Instead of starting with the full proof, it makes sense to see how it works in the more restricted case of the harmonic oscillator:

[formula]

We have used τ(t) as the slowly varying parameter rather than ω because it has the dimensions of time.

As mentioned above, the plan is to construct a quantity J which remains close to I in value as time evolves, but whose time variation can be determined more easily.

The essence of the proof is to write the system in action-angle coordinates (I,φ) with the dynamics governed by the Hamiltonian K(I,φ,τ). Since K is not independent of time we construct an action variable associated with this new Hamiltonian system. This new action variable J, is an average of I over the cycle defined by [formula]. If the system were independent of time, then I and J would coincide. However when τ is varying they may be shown to differ by an amount which is [formula]. The time evolution of J is much slower than that of I and may be determined from the fact that K may be written as a function of J and τ alone (this follows from the fact that J is the action variable derived from the Hamiltonian K). In this way we are able to deduce that [formula] and the adiabatic invariance of J and hence I may then be established.

We start by defining a new pair of coordinates (I,φ) by

[formula]

I is the adiabatic invariant defined by the integral ([\ref=areaintegral]). It may easily be verified that if p and q satisfy Hamilton's equations with respect to the Hamiltonian ([\ref=oscillatorhamiltonian2]), then I and φ satisfy Hamilton's equations with respect to the Hamiltonian

[formula]

The coordinates (I,φ) are therefore canonical.

Now we define the quantity J by

[formula]

where the path of integration is the closed loop in the I,φ plane determined by K(I,φ,τ) = constant and τ  =   constant. Note that this is precisely analogous to the definition ([\ref=areaintegral]) of I. Just as I can be written in terms of p, q and τ, or equivalently in terms of H and τ, we can write J in terms of I, φ and τ, or equivalently in terms of K and τ, using equation ([\ref=K]):

[formula]

The value of the above integral can be most conveniently obtained using an integral round a unit circle in the complex plane. We can now relate J to I by again using equation ([\ref=K]):

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

which is the key result that ties I to J.

Next we need to determine the evolution of J. Differentiating equation ([\ref=K1]) gives

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

This is the result we want. It shows that, if [formula] and [formula] are small, then J(t) will not vary much from its original value and nor, in view of ([\ref=IJ]), will I(t). The details of this final step are deferred to the next section, once it has been determined exactly what is required from a formal definition of adiabatic invariance.

Adiabatic invariance of I: the general case

First we need to adopt a definition of adiabatic invariance. The most useful one for our purposes is as follows:

Let T be an arbitrary fixed time, for all ε > 0 consider variations [formula] such that [formula] and [formula] (e.g., τ(t) = h(εt) for some function h). We say that a quantity I(t) is an adiabatic invariant of the dynamical system if for all such variations of τ we have |I(t) - I(0)| = O(ε) for all [formula].

Now we follow the method laid out in the previous section for the special case of the harmonic oscillator.

From the Hamiltonian H(p,q,τ(t)) we construct new variables I and φ as follows. First we define I:

[formula]

where the integral is taken over the curve (assumed to be closed) H(p,q,τ)  =   constant at constant τ. As before, I will emerge as a function of H and τ. The generating function for the canonical transformation is given by

[formula]

where p in the integral is written in terms of I, q' (a dummy variable) and τ using ([\ref=Igeneral]). Then the angle variable φ and the new Hamiltonian K are given by

[formula]

where H is written as a function of I and τ only.

Now we define J by

[formula]

where the integral is to be taken round the curve (assumed closed) in the (I,φ) plane given by K =  constant. If we write I as a function of H and τ given by I(H,τ), we can use using ([\ref=KH]) and a Taylor series expansion to obtain:

[formula]

where the final partial derivative is to be evaluated at H = K. Substituting into ([\ref=Jint]), and remembering that K is constant in this integral, gives

[formula]

where we have written ω for ∂H / ∂I at fixed τ. Here we assume that ω is bounded away from zero throughout the motion. This corresponds to the requirement that the system remains in a quasi-periodic state for all times under consideration. Neither ω nor [formula] depend explicitly on the small parameter [formula], so the first result, namely at any given time

[formula]

is established.

Now we have to investigate the time evolution of J. Using that fact that J depends on K and τ only, we find

[formula]

so

[formula]

which establishes the second result.

If the variation in τ is adiabatically slow, so that [formula], then by integrating dJ / dt from 0 to t∈[0,T  /  ε] we deduce that |J(t) - J(0)| = O(ε). Our first result, equation ([\ref=eq:firstresult]), then implies that |I(t) - I(0)| = O(ε), i.e., I is an adiabatic invariant.

Conclusion

The theory of adiabatic invariants is one of the more confusing aspects of Hamiltonian mechanics in undergraduate courses on classical dynamics. An intuitive understanding of the concept is often all that is given, and the subtleties ignored. For instance, as we point out, it is not true to say that an adiabatic invariant varies much more slowly than the slowly-varying parameter. As we discussed in section [\ref=sect:airy], the action variable typically has a rate of change comparable with that of the slowly-varying parameter. However, over suitably defined extended periods of time, the change in the adiabatic quantity is much less than the typical change in the quantity being varied. It is in this rather precise sense that the quantity is 'invariant'.

The subtlety in formulating an adequate definition of adiabatic invariance means that a proof of the adiabatic invariance of the action variable, for instance, will of necessity require a certain level of sophistication. In section [\ref=sect:flaws] we pointed out some of the problems encountered in attempts to prove the result directly, i.e., without recourse to the more advanced theory of canonical transformations and action-angle variables. Frequently attempts to prove the adiabatic invariance of the action variable introduce a time averaging procedure; the average being taken over a time scale over which the system is approximately periodic. One may then be tempted to replace the quantity I, which is a geometrical construction given by an integral over a region in phase space bounded by a certain constant energy contour, with an approximation to I based on the trajectory of the particle in question, a dynamical construction requiring the use of Hamilton's equations. This would make no difference if the system were independent of time, but in the time dependent case, one is then left with the problem of keeping track of the all the errors made in using these approximations.

In contrast, our new proof constructs J, a second action variable which has the natural interpretation as the phase space average of I over all points on the constant energy contour, or more precisely, over the angle variable. This is the analogue of the time-averaging procedure normally used. Perhaps naturally, in light of the simplicity with which this fits into the formalism of Hamiltonian mechanics, this leads to a far clearer proof of the adiabatic invariance of action variable where error terms can be easily tracked at every step of the proof.

We have used the harmonic oscillator to illustrate our proof and to emphasize the subtleties that arise in the theory. For the simplest of variations Hamilton's equations may be solved exactly in terms of Airy functions. The asymptotic properties of these functions are well-known and lead to a concrete example of the issues we have discussed in this paper. The harmonic oscillator with arbitrary adiabatic variation is also simple enough to allow for all of the functions introduced in our general proof to be written down in closed form. This provides a useful touchstone for readers following the general proof.
