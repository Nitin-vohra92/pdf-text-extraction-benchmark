Families of linear semigroups with intermediate growth

Growth functions of finitely generated semigroups

Let S be a finitely generated semigroup and let A be a set of generators for S. Every element x∈S can be written as a word with letters from the set A, that is, as a finite product of elements of A. The length of x with respect to A, denoted [formula], is the number of letters in the shortest word that represents x. Note that [formula] if and only if x∈A. We shall assume that  contains an identity element 1 and that 1∉A. We define [formula]

Let [formula] denote the set of positive integers and [formula] the set of nonnegative integers. For every [formula], let λA(n) denote the number of elements of  of length exactly n. We define the growth function γA(n) of S with respect to A by

[formula]

The function γA(n) is an increasing function that counts the number of elements of  of length at most n. If [formula], then, for all nonnegative integers n,

[formula]

and

[formula]

The semigroup S has polynomial growth with respect to the generating set A if there exist positive numbers c and d such that γA(n)  ≤  cnd for all sufficently large n. In this case, log γA(n)  ≤   log c  +  d log n and so

[formula]

If S does not have polynomial growth, then

[formula]

We say that S has superpolynomial growth if

[formula]

The semigroup S has exponential growth with respect to the generating set A if there exists θ  >  1 such that γA(n)  ≥  θn for all sufficently large n. In this case, log γA(n)  ≥  n log θ and so

[formula]

If  does not have exponential growth, then

[formula]

We say that the S has subexponential growth if

[formula]

The semigroup S has intermediate growth with respect to A if the growth of S is both superpolynomial and subexponential.

We review some standard facts about growth functions. Let A and B be finite generating sets for S, and let

[formula]

and

[formula]

Then

[formula]

and

[formula]

These inequalities imply that the growth function γA(n) is polynomial, superpolynomial, subexponential, or exponential if and only if the growth function γB(n) is, respectively, polynomial, superpolynomial, subexponential, or exponential.

Let S and T be finitely generated semigroups and let f:S  →  T be an injective semigroup homomorphism. If A is any finite generating set for , then there is a finite generating set B for   such that

[formula]

for all [formula] If the growth of T is polynomial or subexponential, then the growth of S is, respectively, polynomial or subexponential. If the growth of S is superpolynomial or exponential, then the growth of T is, respectively, superpolynomial or exponential.

Let A be a finite generating set for S, let B' be any finite generating set for T, and let [formula] If [formula], then [formula] for some [formula]. Since [formula], it follows that [formula] Since f is one-to-one, it follows that γ(S)A(n)  ≤  γ(T)B(n). This inequality implies the statements about growth rates.

Let S be a finitely generated subsemigroup of a finitely generated semigroup T. If the growth of T is polynomial or subexponential, then the growth of S is, respectively, polynomial or subexponential. If the growth of S is superpolynomial or exponential, then the growth of T is, respectively, superpolynomial or exponential.

This follows immediately from Lemma [\ref=intermed:lemma:fone-to-one].

Let S and T be finitely generated semigroups and let f:S  →  T be a surjective semigroup homomorphism. If A is any finite generating set for , then B  =  {f(a):a∈A} is a finite generating set for , and

[formula]

for all [formula]. If the growth of S is polynomial or subexponential, then the growth of T is, respectively, polynomial or subexponential. If the growth of T is superpolynomial or exponential, then the growth of S is, respectively, superpolynomial or exponential.

Let [formula] Since f is onto, there exists [formula] such that f(x)  =  y. If [formula] then there is a sequence [formula] such that [formula], and so B  =  {f(a):a∈A} is a generating set for . Conversely, if [formula] and [formula], then there exist [formula] such that [formula]. Let [formula]. Then f(x)  =  y and [formula] This implies that γ(T)B(n)  ≤  γ(S)A(n) for all n, and the growth conditions follow directly from this inequality.

The growth of a finitely generated abelian semigroup S is always polynomial. Indeed, if A is a set of generators for S with [formula], then

[formula]

and

[formula]

More precisely, Khovanskii [\cite=khov92] [\cite=khov95], Nathanson [\cite=nath00d], Nathanson and Ruzsa [\cite=nath02a] proved that there is a polynomial fA(x) with integer coefficients such that λA(n)  =  fA(n) for all sufficiently large integers n. It follows that there is a polynomial FA(x) with integer coefficients such that γA(n)  =  FA(n) for all sufficiently large n.

The growth of finitely generated free semigroups of rank at least two is always exponential. If  is the free semigroup generated by a set of k  ≥  2 elements, then λA(n)  =  kn and γA(n)  =  (kn + 1 - 1) / (k - 1) > kn. By Lemma [\ref=intermed:lemma:subsemi], a semigroup that contains a free subsemigroup on two generators has exponential growth.

Semigroups of intermediate growth are more difficult to construct. Beljaev, Sesekin, and Trofimov [\cite=belj-sese-trof77] proved that the free semigroup generated by two elements e and g with the relations e2  =  e and egiegje  =  egjegie for all nonnegative integers i and j is a semigroup of intermediate growth. Okniski [\cite=okni98] constructed two examples of linear semigroups, that is, subsemigroups of the multiplicative semigroup [formula] of n  ×  n matrices. Let [formula] be the subsemigroup of [formula] generated by the set

[formula]

and let [formula] be the subsemigroup of [formula] generated by the set

[formula]

Both [formula] and [formula] are homomorphic images of the Beljaev, Sesekin, and Trofimov semigroup and have intermediate growth. Nathanson [\cite=nath99b] gave a simple number-theoretical proof that S(1) has intermediate growth, and Lavrik-Männlin [\cite=lavr01] computed the growth function of S(1). Grigorchuk [\cite=grig88] and Shneerson [\cite=shne01a] [\cite=shne04a] [\cite=shne05a] have also investigated the growth of semigroups.

In this paper we apply ideas from additive number theory to construct families of linear semigroups of intermediate growth that generalize Okniski's examples.

Partition functions of sets of positive integers

Results about the intermediate growth of groups and semigroups often use estimates for the asymptotics of partition functions in additive number theory. We review some of these results here.

Let A be a set of positive integers and let pA(n) denote the number of partitions of n into parts belonging to A. If [formula] is the set of all positive integers, then [formula] is the classical partition function.

If A is a nonempty finite set of relatively prime positive integers and [formula] then

[formula]

(Nathanson [\cite=nath00a] and [\cite=nath00aa]). Let pr(n) denote the number of partitions of n into at most r parts, let p̂r(n) denote the number of partitions of n into exactly r parts, and let r(n) denote the number of partitions of n into exactly r distinct parts. Since the number of partitions of n into at most r parts is equal to the number of partitions of n into parts belonging to the set [formula], it follows that

[formula]

and

[formula]

We note that pr(n) and p̂r(n) are increasing functions of n, and

[formula]

If [formula] is a partition of n into r distinct positive parts [formula], then n  ≥  r(r + 1) / 2 and

[formula]

is a partition of n  -  r(r - 1) / 2 into r parts. This identity establishes a bijection between partitions into exactly r distinct parts and partitions into exactly r parts, and so

[formula]

The set A has asymptotic density d(A)  =  α if

[formula]

If d(A)  =  α > 0 and gcd (A)  =  1, then

[formula]

where

[formula]

(An elementary proof of [\eqref=intermed:part] is in Nathanson [\cite=nath00aa].) In particular, if [formula], then α  =  1 and the partition function [formula] satisfies the Hardy-Ramanujan asymptotic estimate

[formula]

If A is the set of odd positive integers, then α  =  1 / 2 and [formula] Let q(n) denote the number of partitions of n into distinct positive integers. Since the number of partitions of an integer into distinct parts is equal to the number of partitions into odd parts, it follows that

[formula]

A condition for subexponential growth

Let S be a semigroup generated by a set A  =  {e,g}, where e is an idempotent. The set

[formula]

is a subsemigroup of S with identity e, and is generated by the set [formula]. Define g0 = 1. Then

[formula]

Suppose that, for all nonnegative integers i1,j1,i2,j2,

[formula]

For all nonnegative integers i and j, let

[formula]

and let γ0(n)  =  γ0,0(n). Then

[formula]

Let [formula] By condition [\eqref=intermed:gijcondition], every representation of x as a word in e and g must be of the form x  =  giy'gj for some [formula]. Therefore,

[formula]

for some [formula]. If [formula], then [formula] and so γi,j(n)  ≤  γ0(n - i - j).

Let S be a semigroup generated by a set A  =  {e,g}, where e is an idempotent, and let S0  =  eSe. Suppose that

For all nonnegative integers k1 and k2,

[formula]

For all nonnegative integers i1,j1,i2,j2,

[formula]

Then the semigroup S has subexponential growth.

If e = 1, then [formula] and condition (ii) is not satisfied. Thus, we can assume that e  ≠  1. If [formula], then there exist positive integers [formula] such that [formula] Multiplying this identity by e, we obtain e = 1, which is absurd. Therefore, [formula].

Let γ0(n) denote the number of elements y∈S0 such that [formula] If y∈S0 and [formula], then conditions (i) and (ii) imply that either y = e or there exist positive integers r and [formula] such that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Thus, to every [formula] with [formula] there are associated a positive integer r and a partition of m - r - 1 into exactly r parts, and so the number of elements y∈S0 of length exactly m is

[formula]

by [\eqref=intermed:prp]. Since [formula], we have

[formula]

Let γi,j(n) denote the growth function of the set giS0gj with respect to the generating set A. By Lemma [\ref=intermed:lemma:gijcondition],

[formula]

By condition (ii), if gi  =  gj, then [formula] and so i  =  j. Therefore, for every n  ≥  0 there is exactly one element in the set {gi}∞i = 0 of length n, and

[formula]

From the asymptotic formula [\eqref=intermed:part] for the partition function, we obtain

[formula]

and so

[formula]

Thus, the growth function γA(n) is subexponential.

Sequences with many partition products

Let W = {wk}∞k = 1 be a sequence of elements in a semigroup [formula] such that

[formula]

for all positive integers k1,k2. To every finite sequence of positive integers [formula] we associate the element [formula]. For every integer r  ≥  1, let Wr(n) denote the subset of X associated to partitions of positive integers not exceeding n into exactly r parts, that is, w∈Wr(n) if and only if there is a sequence of positive integers [formula] such that [formula] and [formula]. We define

[formula]

The sequence {wk}∞k = 1 has many partition products in W if

[formula]

Here are some examples of sequences with many partition products.

For every positive integer d, let [formula] be the multiplicative semigroup of all positive integers u such that [formula] The sequence

[formula]

has many partition products.

Let r  ≥  1 and let [formula] be a sequence of positive integers with [formula] Associated to this sequence is the integer [formula] Let  denote the set of positive integers k such that dk + 1 is prime, and let K(t) count the number of elements [formula] with k  ≤  t. If [formula] and [formula] are distinct sequences of elements of  such that k1  ≤  n / r and j1  ≤  n / r, then [formula] and [formula], hence [formula] and [formula]. By the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, [formula], and so

[formula]

Let π(x,d,1) denote the number of prime numbers p  ≤  x such that [formula] Let

[formula]

Then dk + 1  ≤  x is prime if and only if k  ≤  n / r. By the prime number theorem for arithmetic progressions, for sufficiently large n we have

[formula]

where the implied constants depend only on d. Therefore,

[formula]

and so

[formula]

and

[formula]

It follows that

[formula]

and the sequence {dk + 1}∞k = 1 has many partition products. This completes the proof.

In additive number theory, a sequence {bk}∞k = k0 contained in an additive abelian semigroup is called a B̂r-sequence if sums of r distinct terms of the sequence are distinct, that is, if [formula] and [formula], and if

[formula]

then ki  =  ji for [formula] The sequence is called a B̂∞-sequence if all finite sums of distinct elements of the set are distinct, that is, if [formula] and [formula], and if

[formula]

then r = s and ki  =  ji for [formula] If {bk}∞k = k0 is a sequence of positive real numbers such that [formula] for all [formula], then the sequence is a B̂∞-sequence. In particular, a B̂∞-sequence is a B̂r-sequence for all r  ≥  1.

Let c,c1,d, and t be positive real numbers with t  >  2, and let {ek}∞k = 1 be a sequence of real numbers such that |ek|  ≤  c1kd for all k  ≥  1. There is an integer k0 such that the sequence

[formula]

is a strictly increasing B̂∞-sequence.

Let bk  =  ctk  +  ek for k  ≥  1. Since t > 2 and |ek|  ≤  c1kd, there is an integer k0 such that

[formula]

for all k  ≥  k0, and also

[formula]

for all k  >  k0. Let [formula] Using [\eqref=intermed:partprodineq] and the inequality

[formula]

we obtain

[formula]

This completes the proof.

Let c,c1d, and t be positive real numbers with t  >  2, and let {ek}∞k = 1 be a sequence of real numbers such that |ek|  ≤  c1kd for all k  ≥  1. Let k0 be a positive integer such that sequence

[formula]

is a B̂∞-sequence. Then W has many partial products.

Let bk  =  ctk  +  ek for k  ≥  1. By Lemma [\ref=intermed:lemma:ctr], there is an integer k0 such that W  =  {ctk  +  ek}∞k = k0 is a strictly increasing B̂r-sequence for every positive integer r. To every partition [formula] into exactly r distinct parts [formula], we associate the real number [formula] Since W is a B̂r-sequence, it follows that different partitions are associated to different real numbers, and so, by the partition asymptotic [\eqref=intermed:qkn],

[formula]

and

[formula]

This completes the proof.

A condition for superpolynomial growth

Let S be a semigroup generated by a set A  =  {e,g}, where e is an idempotent. Let S0  =  eSe  =  {exe:x∈S}. Suppose that, for all nonnegative integers k1 and k2,

[formula]

Let φ be a semigroup homomorphism from S0 into a semigroup [formula] such that the sequence

[formula]

has many partition products in [formula]. Then the semigroup S has superpolynomial growth.

Let wk  =  φ(egke) for [formula] Then

[formula]

for all [formula] If [formula], then

[formula]

Let γA(n) denote the growth function of S with respect to A, and let γ0(n) denote the growth function of S0 with respect to A. Fix a positive integer r. If w∈Wr(n - r - 1), then there are positive integers [formula] such that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Let

[formula]

Then

[formula]

and

[formula]

Thus, to every element w∈Wr(n - r - 1) there is at least one element y∈S0 with φ(y)  =  w and [formula], and so

[formula]

It follows that

[formula]

Since this inequality is true for all positive integers r and Φ(r) tends to infinity, it follows that

[formula]

and so the growth function γA(n) is superpolynomial.

The semigroups S(d)

Let d be a positive integer and let S(d) be the subsemigroup of [formula] generated by the matrices

[formula]

and

[formula]

The semigroup [formula] has intermediate growth.

Multiplying matrices, we obtain

[formula]

and

[formula]

for all nonnegative integers k1,k2. It follows that [formula] satisfies condition (i) of Theorem [\ref=intermed:theorem:subexponential], and

[formula]

where Ud is the multiplicative semigroup of positive integers that are congruent to 1 modulo d.

For all [formula] and all nonnegative integers i and j,

[formula]

Let [formula] and [formula]. Then

[formula]

if and only if u1 = u2 and (i1,j1)  =  (i2,j2). Thus, the semigroup [formula] also satisfies condition (ii) of Theorem [\ref=intermed:theorem:subexponential], and so has subexponential growth.

The function

[formula]

defined by

[formula]

is a semigroup homomorphism. Let wk  =  φ(egke)  =  φ((dk + 1)e)  =  dk + 1 and W  =  {dk + 1}∞k = 1. By Theorem [\ref=intermed:theorem:Ud], the sequence W has many partition products. By Theorem [\ref=intermed:theorem:superpolynomial], the semigroup S(d) has superpolynomial growth. This completes the proof.

If d' divides d, then S(d) is a subsemigroup of S(d'). In particular, for every positive integer d, the semigroup S(d) is a finitely generated subsemigroup of the Okniski semigroup S(1). Let S be finitely generated subsemigroup of a finitely generated semigroup S. How are the growth rates of [formula] and S related?

Subsemigroups of [formula]

For k  ≥  0 and m  ≥  1, let [formula] be the symmetric function of degree k in m variables defined by

[formula]

Define [formula] for k < 0. If k  ≥  1 and m  ≥  2, then

[formula]

In particular,

[formula]

and

[formula]

Consider the upper triangular matrices

[formula]

and

[formula]

with coefficients in a ring. For all k  ≥  0, define

[formula]

Then

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

For [formula],

[formula]

if and only if

[formula]

If r = s = 1, then [\eqref=intermed:k1k2commute] holds for all [formula]

Identity [\eqref=intermed:matrixgk] holds for k = 0 and k = 1. If the formula is true for some k  ≥  1, then [\eqref=intermed:symmetric2] and [\eqref=intermed:symmetric3] imply that

[formula]

and identity [\eqref=intermed:matrixgk] follows by induction on k. Identities [\eqref=intermed:matrix-egke] and [\eqref=intermed:matrix-egk1k2e] follow by matrix multiplication, and [\eqref=intermed:k1k2commute] and [\eqref=intermed:k1k2commutebecause] follow from inspection of [\eqref=intermed:matrix-egk1k2e]. This completes the proof.

Let t,u,v,w be real numbers with t  >  2. Let T be the subsemigroup of [formula] generated by the matrices

[formula]

and

[formula]

The semigroup  has intermediate growth.

For every [formula], let

[formula]

and

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=intermed:lemma:semigroupT], we have e2 = e,

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

for [formula].

Let [formula] Then [formula] consists of all matrices of the form

[formula]

where [formula] is a finite sequence of nonnegative integers. For [formula], the set [formula] consists of all matrices of the form

[formula]

Since {ti}∞i = 0 is a strictly increasing sequence of real numbers, formula [\eqref=intermed:eMatrix] implies that for all [formula],

[formula]

if and only if

[formula]

Thus, the semigroup  satisfies conditions (i) and (ii) of Theorem [\ref=intermed:theorem:subexponential] and so has subexponential growth.

Define the function [formula] by

[formula]

where c  =  uv / (t - 1)2 and ek  =  (w - uv / (t - 1))k - c  =  O(k). Then φ is a homomorphism from [formula] into the additive group of real numbers. By Theorem [\ref=intermed:theorem:Br], there is an integer k0 such that the sequence W  =  {wk}∞k = k0 has many partial products. By Theorem [\ref=intermed:theorem:superpolynomial], the semigroup  has superpolynomial growth. This completes the proof.
