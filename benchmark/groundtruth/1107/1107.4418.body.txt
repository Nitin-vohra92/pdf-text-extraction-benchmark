Introduction

The Comic Rays spectrum at high energies[\cite=PDG10] [\cite=Gaisser] become quite elaborated these days. In particular, the so-called "knee", slightly above 1015eV, and the "ankle", slightly above 1018.5eV, appear rather convincingly. To develop the field further, it is important to understand how these phenomena occur, especially in our Universe.

In this note, we are interested in cosmic rays in the energy range greater than 1014eV but less than 1026eV, including those greater than 1020eV (those unexplored regimes), the so-called "ultra high energy cosmic rays (UHECR's)". In particular, we examine the interaction of UHECR with the [formula] cosmic microwave background (CMB), one cosmic media in our Universe. As seen below, the center of mass (CM) energy squared would be 1.3  ×  1019eV2 for an UHECR of energy 1022  eV intersecting or interacting a CMB photon. So, the CM energy would be 1.15  ×  1011  eV, or 115 GeV, if an UHECR of energy 1025  eV intersects a CMB photon. It is slightly above the mass of the Z0 weak boson. So, the energy range which we talk about coincides the range which the Standard Model[\cite=PDG10] is well tested - so, we shouldn't anticipate any new physics but only a replay of the Standard Model physics in a very peculiar kinematic setup. Isn't it?

What is an UHECR particle? The possibility may include the protons, neutrons (time-dilated), deuterons, alphas, the heavy nuclei, neutrinos, and others. For some reason they could be produced or accelerated to these energies. In the bottom-up scenario, heavy nuclei from astronomical events, maybe severer than supernovae explosions and happening (approaching) in our direction with high relative velocities, may provide UHECR's of greater than 1020  eV; chunks of nuclei or protons would be the origins of those extremely high energy particles (say, ≥  1022  eV).

The muon, if produced at 1022  eV, would have a time-dilation factor 1022 / 108, or 1014; the lifetime would be 2  ×  10- 6  ×  1014 sec , or 2  ×  108 sec  (about 7 years). So, 7 light years (a muon produced and captured 7 light years away) are still too short in our astronomical environments. Others such as pions, kaons, etc. have lifetimes even much shorter and do not play a role here[\cite=PDG10]. On the other hand, a neutron of 1022  eV, of which the lifetime at rest is 15   min , would have a dilated lifetime 1,000   sec   ×  1022 / 109 or 1016   sec  or 3.17  ×  108 years. So, neutrons of 1022eV would be fairly stable and could come from 317 Mega light years away or 100 Mpc away.

In this context, we know that the electrons, positrons, photons, etc., could not survive beyond certain (high) energies, because of the electromagnetic interactions. For example, e±  +  γCMB  →  e±  +  γ, γ  +  γCMB  →  e-  +  e+, etc.

In our Universe, there are plenty of [formula] cosmic microwave background (CMB) and [formula] cosmic neutrino background (CνB). Even though the energies of these particles sound extremely low, the ultra high energy cosmic rays (UHECR), including protons, in fact can see them if energy is high enough. In particular, the following reactions don't have the thresholds:

On the other hand, the reactions listed below have some thresholds and would start to play some important roles, when UHECR's energy reaches at the threshold:

plus some others. Hereafter we assume that cosmic rays, depending on the energy, would be composition of all "stable" particles, including protons, deuterons, e±, μ±, γ, ν, etc. As said earlier, μ± may be the borderline of "stable particles" when we consider the effects due to time dilation; the neutrons, with the lifetime (≈   15 min) much longer, could be "stable" if the energy is greater than, e.g. 1022eV. High energy ν (those higher than tens of GeV) are presumably there but, in view of the feeble nature of weak interactions, cannot be seen so far. These are well-known particles; thus, in this note we don't speculate on those unknown particles, such as super-symmetric particles.

Here we assume that in the UHECR there contain γ, p, d, etc., with certain probabilities - our definition of UHECR[\cite=Gaisser]. The UHECR's interact with the CMB photons via the above reactions and etc. This note emphasizes the interactions of UHECR's with CMB, and emphasizes CMB's visibility by UHECR's.

In a related context[\cite=Ma], we discussed the interplay of the cosmic neutrino background (CνB) and UHECR's, assuming some clustering of CνB. The significant clustering of CνB would lead to the first detection of the CνB. So far, the detection of CνB is still in the air. In this note, we try to provide some semi-quantitative treatments of the interplay of CMB and UHECR.

Initial Thinking

Let us quote the Compton-scattering formula[\cite=Wu]:

[formula]

Now the initial photon is the CMB photon. Suppose that the energy of the UHECR proton is 1022 eV and so the CM energy is s  ≈  2  ×  1022eV  ·  6.5  ×  10- 4eV  ≈  1.3  ×  1019eV2. So, we obtain

[formula]

which already exceeds the size of the present Universe (about 4500 Mpc).

On the other hand, Ep = 1020eV would imply the mean free path λ  ≈  2000  Mpc and Ep  =  1018eV implies λp  ≈  20Mpc.

Now we turn our attention to the similar formula if the UHECR is the electron (positron). For the electron energy Ee = 1015  eV, we have s  ≈  2  ×  1015eV  ·  6.5  ×  10- 4  eV  ≈  1.3  ×  1012eV2 so that σ  ≈  3.35  ×  10- 4  ·  s- 1 ln (s / m2e)  ≈  4.14  ×  10- 16  eV- 2, the cross section corresponding to 0.17  barns, or to λe  ≈  50kpc. If nothing else happens, then the electron would be deflected in 50  kpc.

For the muon of energy 1019  eV or 1.3  ×  1016eV2, we have σ  ≈  3.35  ×  10- 4  ·  s- 1 ln (s / m2μ) or σ  ≈  0.7176  ×  10- 23  eV- 2. For such muon, the (dilated) lifetime becomes 2  ×  10- 6  ×  1019 - 8 sec  or 2  ×  105 sec . Combining the two, a muon of energy 1024eV would last 2  ×  1010 sec  and gets negligible effect from bremsstrahlung.

For the reaction γ  +  γCMB  →  γ  +  γ, it comes from the box diagrams and is of higher order, O((α / 2π)4) (and so is small). Thus, we needn't consider it for the moment. For α  +  γCMB  →  α  +  γ or off other nuclei, the situation is similar to that for p + γCMB  →  p + γ, as described as above.

UHECR physics near 1020  eV

Next, we consider those inelastic reactions which might leave their marks on the UHECR physics, say, Reactions (5)-(9), etc. Reliable estimates can be obtained by working out the peculiar kinematics and using the well-known cross sections.

Let us consider, for example, Reaction (6), i.e. p + γCMB  →  p + (e-e+), with (e-e+) characterized a composite mass [formula]. The four momentum conservation reads

[formula]

Or, we have

[formula]

We find

[formula]

[formula]

To get some ideas, we have [formula] as S  →    ∞  . As quoted earlier (as our benchmark), at E  ≈  1022eV, one has σ  ≈  10- 23eV- 2  ≈  4pb and, with the density of CMB photons, we find a mean free path λ  ≈  2  ×  105Mpc, bigger than the Universe size of 4,000 Mpc.

However, the [formula] behavior indicates that at E  ≈  1018eV we have σ  ≈  0.4nb or λ  ≈  20Mpc, a noticeable result. Comparing the process p  +  γCMB  →  p  +  (e-e+) to p + γCMB  →  p + γ, we lose a factor of α. This means that at 1018eV this effect is barely visible. This would be a marginal explanation of the ankle effect!!

Fortunately, there are other reactions, such as d + γCMB  →  p + n (Reaction (7)) or similar, with the thresholds in the range of a couple of MeV. The deuteron component in the UHECR flux might be small but the cross section is much bigger - it serves as an additional reason for the "ankle".

Our explanation of the "ankle" makes some sense. In general, the electromagnetic effects out of CMB photons, or of higher order, would make marks in the UHECR physics. On the other hand, the weak reactions, of cross section 10- 42cm2 (=  10- 6pb), are mostly invisible.

Now let us return to Reaction (5), i.e. γ  +  γCMB  →  e-  +  e+. We have

[formula]

This means that the high energy photons, those greater than 4.1  ×  1014eV, would be depleted from UHECR. After all, the electromagnetic reactions proceed fast enough. The depletion of the photons from UHECR would explain the happening of the "knee".

Channel (6) or (7) or others, as described as above in a simplified manner, would not occur until UHECR reaches a certain threshold. This happens for UHECR at 1018.5eV, the place for the "ankle". In fact, the cross section for the channel p  +  γCMB  →  p  +  (e-e+) would be down by a factor of α  /  π (as compared to, for example, Reaction (5) or (7)), but the logarithmic plot for the UHECR could show that - the effect of 10- 2.5 if protons are majority of UHECR.

Let come back to Reaction (7), i.e. d  +  γCMB  →  p  +  n. At the threshold, we find, UHECR identified as deuterons,

[formula]

These numbers indicate the threshold of (2me), or sightly above, to occur at 1018.5eV, as explained earlier.

How about reactions (8), (9), etc.? In fact, heavy nuclei (A  ≥  3), as seen by the Auger Collaboration[\cite=Gaisser] [\cite=PDG10], could be of some importance. As indicated earlier, this may be so if parts of UHECR's come from the inward collapse of Supernova explosion.

We see that a lot of nuclear reactions with effective energies less than 10 MeV may become relevant at 1019eV, until we hit another threshold of the famous GZK[\cite=GZK]:

[formula]

This is another order of magnitude - but very close in our logarithmic plot. Clearly, interesting physics occurs for UHECR of energy 1018.5  -  20.5eV.

To say it explicitly, 1020eV is where the GZK effect occurs and 1018.5eV is where the "knee" appears (and where nuclear physics dominates). So, what is above 1021 - 25  eV? Particle physics is probed by CMB - that would be our answer.

The high energy cosmic rays measured in the atmosphere are what we are interested most. We are already in the vicinity of 1020  eV, maybe marching toward higher and the higher. Those UHECR's may come from the outside solar system, or from the distant galaxies, and these would be most interesting. As we have said earlier, these UHECR's are presumably there for a while and thus stable, composed of "stable" particles, such as e±, γ, ν, p, [formula], d, ..., n, μ±, etc. We don't take into account e± because of their zigzag paths. we so far don't take into account ν's or [formula]'s mainly due to their (weak) no-interacting features. As indicated before, too high energy photons (greater than 4.1  ×  1014eV) could become elusive also. How to reproduce the UHECR curve[\cite=Gaisser] should be one of the most urgent questions.

UHECR Physics near 1025  eV

An UHECR particle of energy 1025  eV encountering the [formula] CMB photon would have the CM energy squared of 1.3  ×  1022  eV2 or the CM energy 115  GeV, just above the W± or Z0 mass. This is where Weiler called it the Z0-bursts[\cite=Weiler]. Clearly, both W± and Z0 show up at these energies.

If the UHECR particle would be a proton, an alpha particle, or one of those familiar particles in the Standard Model, it would be a replay of the Standard Model[\cite=PDG10], except the very odd kinematics.

What if the UHECR particle is something else, such as some supersymmetric particle? But it interacts with the [formula] CMB photon, or with the electromagnetic interactions; it means that it carries the electric charge. We infer that this supersymmetric particle cannot be the lowest-mass neutral supersymmetric particle. The open-up of new channel would be very interesting.

In other words, the initial UHECR's do not have to be the ordinary particles and may not interact with the [formula] CMB - we should partition these UHECR's accordingly. It could be the supersymmetric particle to begin with - the primary supersymmetric particle decays eventually the most stable neutral supersymmetric particle plus a bunch of more familiar particles. Our Universe might be full of surprises foe us.

The other aspect is well-known - the occurrence of the W± or Z0 bursts when we crosses the thresholds, as we know the CM energy exceeding 100  GeV. This ought to be rather familiar, except that things are happening with the very odd kinematics.

Outlook

Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays, for the energy greater than 1014eV but less than 1026eV, via interactions with the Cosmic Microwave Background, sort of map out nuclear physics in the lower end (less than 1020  eV) and particle physics in the higher end (near 1026  eV). Why is this interesting? CMB serves as as the medium, becoming the obstacle when the comic rays are energetic enough. CMB and UHECR are both exotic and deserve our attention.
