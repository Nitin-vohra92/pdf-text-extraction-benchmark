Saari's homographic conjecture for planar equal-mass three-body problem under a strong force potential

Saari's homographic conjecture

In 1969, Donald Saari conjectured that if a N-body system has a constant moment of inertia then the motion is a rotation with constant mutual distances rij [\cite=SaariOriginal]. Here, the moment of inertia I is defined by

[formula]

with mk and qk being the masses and position vectors of body [formula]. This is now called Saari's original conjecture. In the conference "Saarifest 2005" at Guanajuato Mexico, Richard Moeckel proved that the original conjecture is true for three-body problem in [formula] for any d  ≥  2 [\cite=MockelProof] [\cite=MoeckelSaarifest].

In the same conference, Saari extended his conjecture. His new conjecture is "if the configurational measure Iα / 2U is constant then the N-body motion is homographic" [\cite=SaariCollisions] [\cite=SaariSaarifest], where,

[formula]

is the potential function. This is indeed a natural extension of the original conjecture. Note that a solution qk of N bodies is called homographic if the configuration formed by the N bodies moves in such a way as to remain similar to itself. For α  ≠  2, we can show that if the moment of inertia is constant then U is constant, therefore the configurational measure is also constant. For α  =  2, on the other hand, I =  constant does not yields U =  constant [\cite=Chenciner1997]. Actually, there are some counter examples for the original conjecture for α = 2 [\cite=Chenciner2002][\cite=Roberts]. However, the extended conjecture is expected to be true for α = 2 and all α > 0.

Florin Diacu, Toshiaki Fujiwara, Ernesto Pérez-Chavela and Manuele Santoprete called this conjecture the "Saari's homographic conjecture" and partly proved this conjecture for some cases [\cite=DiacHomographic]. No one proved this conjecture completely, as far as we know.

Obviously, Saari's conjecture is related to the motion in shape. Here, a shape is a configuration of N bodies up to rotation and scaling. To prove the Saari's original and homographic conjecture, it is important to find appropriate variables to describe motion in shape. The moment of inertia I describes the motion in size, and the angular momentum C describes the rotation. What are the appropriate variables to describe the motion in shape?

An answer was given by Richard Moeckel and Richard Montgomery [\cite=M&M]. They used the ratio of the Jacobi coordinate to describe the motion in shape for planar three-body problem. Let us explain precisely. To avoid non-essential complexity, let us consider equal masses case, and set mk = 1 in this paper. We take the center of mass frame. So, we have

[formula]

In the three-body problem, we have two Jacobi coordinates,

[formula]

Since, we are considering planar motions, let us identify qk and zi with complex numbers. Then, we can define the ratio of the Jacobi coordinates,

[formula]

Note that the variable ζ is invariant under the size change and rotation, qk  ↦  λeiθqk with [formula]. Therefore, ζ depends only on the shape. The great idea by Moeckel and Montgomery is to use the variable ζ to describe the shape. They actually write down the Lagrangian by the variable ζ, the moment of inertia I and the rotation angle θ. They also write down the equations of motion for these variables.

Using the formulation developed by Moeckel and Montgomery, we will show that the Saari's homographic conjecture is true for planar equal-mass three-body problem under the strong force potential,

[formula]

Namely, we will show that dζ / dt = 0 if and only if IU =  constant.

In the section [\ref=Lagrangian], we derive the Lagrangian in terms of I, θ and ζ by elementary calculations. The equations of motion and some useful relations are also shown in this section. Every relations in the section [\ref=Lagrangian] are valid for α  ≠  0. In the section [\ref=Proof], we concentrate on the strong force potential α = 2. We will prove the Saari's homographic conjecture for this case. Details in calculation are shown in [\ref=Mathematica]. In the [\ref=properties], some properties of the shape variable ζ, which may useful to understand this variable.

Lagrangian for planar equal-mass three-body problem in terms of shape, size and rotation angle

In this section, we consider the planar equal-mass three-body problem under the potential function ([\ref=def:U]) with m1 = m2 = m3 = 1 for α  ≠  0. Let [formula] be twice of the kinetic energy, and let the Lagrangian and the total energy be L = K / 2 + U / α and E  =  K / 2 - U / α, respectively. In the center of mass frame ([\ref=CM0]) all quantities ξk = qk / (q2 - q1) are expressed by the shape variable in ([\ref=eq:zeta]), as follows,

[formula]

Obviously, the triangle made of q1,q2,q3 is similar to the triangle made of ξ1,ξ2,ξ3. Therefore, there are some I  ≥  0 and [formula], such that

[formula]

We treat I, θ and ζ as independent dynamical variables.

Lagrangian

Then, direct calculations for K yields

[formula]

Here, the wedge product [formula] represents [formula] for [formula], and the dot d / dt. On the other hand, the potential function U is

[formula]

Therefore, the configurational measure μ is a function of the shape variable ζ,

[formula]

Thus, we get the Lagrangian

[formula]

in terms of I, θ, ζ and their velocities. Or, identifying ζ = x + iy with [formula] to a two dimensional vector [formula], the Lagrangian is expressed as

[formula]

with [formula] and

[formula]

Equation of motion for rotation angle

Obviously, the variable θ is cyclic. Therefore, we get the conservation law of the angular momentum,

[formula]

Then, the kinetic energy K / 2 is given by

[formula]

The three terms in the right hand side represent kinetic energies for the scale change, for the rotation and for the shape change.

Equation of motion for the moment of inertia

The Euler-Lagrange equation for the moment of inertia I,

[formula]

yields

[formula]

Multiplying [formula] both side of the equation ([\ref=eq:I2]), we get

[formula]

This means

[formula]

Therefore, we get

[formula]

This relation was first derived by Saari [\cite=SaariCollisions]. We would like to call this "Saari's relation". Inspired by this relation, let us introduce new 'time' variable s defined by

[formula]

Then, we have

[formula]

and the Saari's relation ([\ref=eq:SaariRelation]) is

[formula]

Equation of motion for the shape variables

The Euler-Lagrange equation for [formula],

[formula]

yields

[formula]

Using the 'time' variable s, this equation of motion is

[formula]

Inner product of [formula] and [formula] yields

[formula]

This is nothing but the Saari's relation in ([\ref=eq:SaariRelationInS]). While, the wedge product of the same pair yields

[formula]

Every equations are valid for all α  ≠  0. We will use these expressions later.

Proof of the Saari's homographic conjecture under the strong force potential

In this section, we will prove the Saari's homographic conjecture for the case α = 2, namely, [formula] if and only if μ  =   constant .

Let us assume

[formula]

Then, by the Saari's relation ([\ref=eq:SaariRelationInS]), we have

[formula]

with constant k  ≥  0.

If k = 0, then [formula], namely [formula].

Let us examine the case k > 0. For this case, the point [formula] moves on the curve [formula] with constant speed [formula]. This motion of [formula] is not able to keep [formula]. Because, the points that satisfy [formula] are only five central configurations at [formula]. See figure [\ref=fig:contourForMu].

So, we can take some finite arc of the curve [formula] on which

[formula]

Then the equation ([\ref=eq:constantVelocity]) and

[formula]

yields

[formula]

Here, ε  =    ±  1 determines the direction of the motion on the curve μ  =  μ0. Differentiate this expression by s again, we have

[formula]

Therefore, we get

[formula]

Therefore, the curvature ρ- 1 of the curve μ  =  μ0 should be

[formula]

On the other hand, by the relation ([\ref=eq:fromTheEquationOfMotion]) which is a result of the equation of motion and the expression for the velocity ([\ref=eq:velocity]), we have another expression for the curvature

[formula]

Our plan to exclude the case k > 0 is the following. Since [formula] constant, the parameter s is proportional to the arc length of the curve [formula] on μ  =  μ0. Therefore, if k > 0 there must be finite arc, on which the curvature ([\ref=eq:kappa]) coincides with ([\ref=eq:kappa2]). We call such arc non-Saari arc. In the following, we will show that non-Saari arc does not exist. Namely, k > 0 is impossible.

Let us examine the condition for the two curvature have the same value. The condition is

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

Where, [formula] and [formula]. The left hand side is a ratio of polynomials of x2 , y2, C2 and k2. Let the numerator of this ratio be a polynomial P(x2,y2,C2,k2), then x2, y2 must satisfy the following equation,

[formula]

The maximum power of the variables for P are x60, y60, C2 and k4.

On the other hand, the equation μ  =  μ0 is also a ratio of polynomials of x2, y2 and μ0. Let the numerator of this ratio be a polynomial Q, then we have the following equation

[formula]

The non-Saari arc must satisfy both P = 0 and Q = 0 for some value of parameters C2, k2 and μ0.

There is no finite arc with x = x0  =   fixed and μ  =  μ0. Because, for x = x0, Q = 0 is a polynomial of y2 of order y6 with the coefficient of y6 being 64  ≠  0. Therefore, solutions of y for Q = 0 are discrete. Thus, any finite arc must have some finite interval x1  ≤  x  ≤  x2.

There is no finite interval x1  ≤  x  ≤  x2 that every x in this interval satisfy P = Q = 0. To show this, we eliminate y2 from P(x2,y2) = Q(x2,y2) = 0 to get new polynomial R(x2) = 0. This polynomial turns out to be order x68,

[formula]

Where, A is a big integer. To have continuous solution of x for R = 0, the polynomial R must be identically equal to zero. Namely, all coefficients cn, [formula] must be zero. Therefore, we have 25 conditions for only three parameters C2, k2 and μ0. Actually, there are no parameters to make all 25 coefficients vanish. See [\ref=Mathematica] for detail. Therefore, there is no finite interval of x on which P = Q = 0 is satisfied. Thus k > 0 case is excluded.

Therefore, we have proved that if μ  =   constant, then [formula], namely the three-body keep its shape of the triangle being similar.

Inversely, if [formula], then obviously μ(ζ) is constant. This completes a proof for the Saari's homographic conjecture for the case α = 2 planar equal-mass three-body problem.

Details in calculation

In this Appendix, details in calculation are shown. The following calculations were performed using Mathematica 8.0.1.0.

To eliminate the variable y2 from the equation P = Q = 0, we calculate the resultant of P and Q with respect to y2,

[formula]

In the actual calculations, we replaced y2 with Y and calculated Resultant

[formula]

Properties of the shape variable

In this appendix, some properties of the shape variable ζ is shown.

Geometrical interpretation of the shape variable

According to the work of Moeckel and Montgomery [\cite=M&M], we defined the shape variable ζ as the ratio of the Jacobi coordinates, in the section [\ref=Introduction]. Here, we give a geometrical interpretation of this definition.

For given triangle q1q2q3, we can transform the points q1  ↦  a =  - 1 / 2 and q2  ↦  b = 1 / 2 keeping the similarity and the orientation of the triangle. The points a and b are fixed. Let ζ be the image of q3 by this transformation. So, the triangles q1q2q3 and abζ are similar and have same orientation. See figure [\ref=fig:defOfZeta]. It is clear that the variable ζ describe the shape of the triangle q1q2q3. This gives an alternative definition of the shape variable ζ.

The center of mass of the triangle abζ is ζ / 3. To make the center of mass being fixed to the origin, we subtract ζ / 3 from the three vertices. Thus, we have three vertices ξ1 =  - 1 / 2 - ζ / 3, ξ2 = 1 / 2 - ζ / 3 and ξ3 = 2ζ / 3. These are the equations ([\ref=eq:xi1])-([\ref=eq:xi3]).

Contribution to the angular momentum of the shape change

The motion in ζ contributes to a size change and the angular momentum as well as shape change. To eliminate the contribution to the size change, we normalized ξk by the size [formula]. Let us write the normalized variable ηk,

[formula]

Then, ηk have unit size, therefore, have no contribution to the size change.

The variables ηk still contribute to the angular momentum. The equation ([\ref=eq:angularMomentum]) describes that the total angular momentum is the sum of the angular momentum of the rotation angle [formula] and the angular momentum of the shape change [formula].

We can subtract the angular momentum from ηk. The result is the variable Qk, k = 1,2,3 introduced by Diacu et al. They defined Qk as follows,

[formula]

They showed that Qk satisfy [formula], [formula] and [formula] [\cite=DiacHomographic]. Namely, the variables Qk have unit size and no rotation (vanishing angular momentum). They used this variables Qk to analyze the shape change.

To have a expression for Qk by ζ, let us write the relation between ζ and qk. Integrating the equation ([\ref=eq:angularMomentum]), we get the expression for θ(t),

[formula]

Substituting this expression to the equation ([\ref=eq:q]), we get the relation,

[formula]

with the equations ([\ref=eq:xi1])-([\ref=eq:xi3]) for ξk. Now, we can express Qk by ζ,

[formula]

Note that the mutual relations between qk(t), Qk(t) and ζ(t) are not local in time. For example, the variable Qk(t) depend on the history of ζ(t') with t  ≥  t'  ≥  0.

Energy for the shape change

The term "energy for the shape change" should be treated carefully. In the equation ([\ref=eq:PartsOfKineticEnergy]), it is natural to understand the therm [formula] be the energy for the size change and C2  /  (2I) be the energy for the rotaion. The last term should be the "energy for the shape change". This is not the kinetic energy of ηk, [formula]. Because this term contains the rotation energy [formula], which is counted in the energy for the rotation C2 / (2I). In the equation ([\ref=eq:calcK]), the "energy for the shape change" is naturally defined by the kinetic energy minus the rotation energy,

[formula]

One may be convinced of this result by knowing that this is equal to [formula], the kinetic energy for Qk which have unit size and no rotation. To see this, an alternative expression for ([\ref=eq:QandZeta])

[formula]

will be useful.
