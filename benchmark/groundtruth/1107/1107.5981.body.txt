Existence of complete Lyapunov functions for semiflows on separable metric spaces

Complete Lyapunov functions

Let φt:X  →  X be a semiflow on a metric space X and denote by RC(φt) its chain recurrent set. A complete Lyapunov function for the semiflow φt is a continuous function L:X  →  [0,1] satisfying the following requirements:

The function t  ↦  L(φt(x)) is constant for each x∈RC(φt) and is decreasing for each x∈X  -  RC(φt).

The set L(RC(φt)) is nowhere dense in

[formula]

A complete Lyapunov function for a continuous map T:X  →  X is a continuous function L:X  →  [0,1] satisfying the above requirements, changing the function t  ↦  L(φt(x)) by the function n  ↦  L(Tn(x)) and changing the chain recurrent set of φt by the chain recurrent set of T, denoted by RC(T).

The existence of a complete Lyapunov function for flows on compact metric spaces was originally proved by Conley in [\cite=conley]. After this, in the reference [\cite=franks], Franks proved the existence of a complete Lyapunov function for maps on compact metric spaces, which was extended to locally compact and then to separable metric spaces by Hurley respectively in [\cite=hurley1] and [\cite=hurley3]. In some places (see e.g. [\cite=alongi-nelson] [\cite=norton] [\cite=patrao]), these existence results are referred as the Fundamental Theorem of Dynamical Systems.

The aim of this short note is to show how to construct a complete Lyapunov function of a semiflow by using a complete Lyapunov function of its time-one map. As a byproduct we assure the existence of complete Lyapunov functions for semiflows on separable metric spaces.
