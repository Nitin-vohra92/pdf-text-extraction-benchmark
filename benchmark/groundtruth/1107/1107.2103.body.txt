Study of the anisotropic magnetic order of the Eu sublattice in single crystals of EuFe2 - xCoxAs2 (x=0, 0.2) by means of magnetization and magnetic torque

Introduction

The discovery of superconductivity in the iron-based pnictides [\cite=Kamihara08] provided a new class of compounds to the high temperature superconductor (HTS) family. Three main groups of these iron-based superconductors are intensively studied: the RFeAsO compounds with R = La-Gd ('1111'),[\cite=Kamihara08] [\cite=Chen08] the ternary arsenides AFe2As2 with A = Ba, Sr, Ca, Eu ('122'),[\cite=Rotter] and the binary chalcogenides such as FeSe1 - x ('11').[\cite=Hsu] Similar to the cuprate HTS's, the undoped iron-pnictides are not superconducting (SC) at ambient pressure and undergo a spin-density wave (SDW) transition at high temperatures.[\cite=Xiao09] The SC state in iron-based compounds can be achieved either under pressure (chemical and hydrostatic) [\cite=Torikachvili] [\cite=Sun] [\cite=Lee] [\cite=Alireza] [\cite=Igawa] [\cite=Fukazawa] [\cite=Duncan] [\cite=Mani] [\cite=Terashima] [\cite=Miclea] or by appropriate charge carrier doping of the parent compounds,[\cite=RenLu08] [\cite=Matsuishi08] [\cite=Zhao08] both accompanied by a suppression of the SDW state.

Here, we focus on EuFe2As2 which is a particularly interesting member of the ternary system AFe2As2, since the A site is occupied by a rare earth Eu2 + S-state (orbital moment L = 0) ion with a 4f7 electronic configuration. Eu2 + has a total electron spin S = 7/2, corresponding to a theoretical effective magnetic moment of 7.94 μB. It is the only known member of the '122' family containing 4f electrons. In addition to the SDW ordering of the Fe moments at TSDW ≃ 190 K, an antiferromagnetic (AFM) order of the Eu2 + spins at TAFM ≃ 19 K was reported by Mössbauer and susceptibility measurements.[\cite=Raffius93] [\cite=ZRen] [\cite=SJiang] Recently, neutron diffraction measurements were performed on EuFe2As2 and the magnetic structure illustrated in Fig. 1 was established.[\cite=Xiao09] This material exhibits an A-type AFM order of the Eu2 + moments, e.g., the Eu2 + spins align ferromagnetically in the planes, while the planes are coupled antiferromagnetically.[\cite=Xiao09] [\cite=Blundell] It was demonstrated that by applying a high enough magnetic field, the Eu2 + moments can be realigned ferromagnetically in both the parent compound EuFe2As2 [\cite=SJiang] [\cite=Xiao] as well as in the Co-doped system EuFe2 - xCoxAs2 (x = 0.22).[\cite=ShuaiJiang] In addition, neutron diffraction measurements [\cite=Xiao] suggested a canted AFM (C-AFM) structure of the Eu2 + moments in EuFe2As2 at intermediate magnetic fields.

Co-substitution may induce superconductivity in EuFe2 - xCoxAs2 with a reentrant behavior of resistivity due to the AFM ordering of the Eu2 + spins.[\cite=He08] Reentrant superconducting behavior was also observed in resistivity experiments on EuFe2As2 under an applied pressure up to 2.5 GPa.[\cite=Terashima] [\cite=Miclea] However, only above 2.8 GPa, where a valence change of the Eu ions from a divalent magnetic state (4f7, J = 7/2) to a trivalent nonmagnetic state (4f6, J = 0) was suggested to occur,[\cite=Sun] a sharp transition to a zero-resistivity state was observed.[\cite=Terashima] Bulk superconductivity was also achieved in EuFe2As2 - xPx [\cite=Sun] [\cite=Jeevan] where isovalent P-substitution of the As-site includes chemical pressure in EuFe2As2. No superconductivity was detected in EuFe2 - xNixAs2,[\cite=ZRen09] while superconductivity with a maximum Tc ≃ 20 K was reported for BaFe2 - xNixAs2.[\cite=LiLuo08] It was suggested in various reports [\cite=SJiang] [\cite=Dengler10] [\cite=Ying10] [\cite=ZRen09] that there is a strong coupling between the localized Eu2 + spins and the conduction electrons of the Fe2As2 layers. Recently, the hyperfine coupling constant AEu between the 75As nuclei and the Eu 4f states in EuFe1.9Co0.1As2 was quantitatively determined from 75As NMR to be AEu = -1.9 ×   107 A/mμB.[\cite=Guguchia] This large value of AEu indicates a strong coupling between the Eu2 + localized moments and the charge carriers in the Fe2As2 layers and points to a strong correlation between the ordering of the localized magnetic moments and superconductivity in EuFe2 - xCoxAs2.

It is well established that the SDW state of the Fe moments is suppressed as a result of Co doping. However, at present there is no clear picture how the ordering of the Eu spins develops with increasing Co concentration. Generally, it was assumed that in the '122' systems the direction of the sublattice magnetization of the Eu2 + magnetic moments is strongly affected by the magnetic behavior of the Fe atoms.[\cite=Xiao09] [\cite=Nowik] [\cite=NowikF] [\cite=Feng] [\cite=NowikFel] [\cite=NowikFelner] Thus, it is important to compare the magnetic properties of the Eu-sublattice in EuFe2 - xCoxAs2 without and with Co doping in order to study the correlation between ordering of Eu2 + moments and the magnetism of the Fe sublattice. This in turn, is crucial to understand the interplay between magnetism of localized moments and supercondcutivity in EuFe2 - xCoxAs2.

In this work, we present magnetic susceptibility, magnetization, and magnetic torque experiment performed on single crystals of EuFe2 - xCoxAs2 (x = 0, 0.2). The goal of this study is to investigate the macroscopic magnetic properties of the Eu-sublattice. Magnetic susceptibility and magnetization investigations provide information on the magnetic structure of a single-crystal sample in magnetic fields applied along the principal axes. In addition, the evolution of the magnetic structure as a function of the tilting angle of the magnetic field and the crystallographic axis can be studied by magnetic torque. This paper is organized as follows: Experimental details are described in Sec. II. The results of the magnetic susceptibility, the magnetization and the magnetic torque measurements are presented and discussed in Sec. III. In Sec. IV the magnetic phase diagrams of the Eu2 + sublattice ordering with respect to magnetic field and temperature in single crystals of EuFe2 - xCoxAs2 (x = 0, 0.2) are discussed. The conclusions follow in Sec. V.

EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

Single crystals of EuFe2 - xCoxAs2 (x = 0, 0.2) were grown out of Sn flux.[\cite=Guguchia] The magnetization measurements of the EuFe2 - xCoxAs2 (x = 0, 0.2) samples were performed with a commercial SQUID magnetometer ([formula] MPMS-XL) with the magnetic field H applied parallel (H [formula] c) or perpendicular (H [formula] c) to the crystallographic c-axis. The magnetic torque measurements were carried out using a home-made torque sensor.[\cite=Kohout2007] The sample is mounted on a platform hanging on piezoresistive legs. A magnetic field [formula] applied to the sample having magnetic moment [formula] results in a mechanical torque [formula] = [formula]. This torque bends the legs, and thus creats a measurable electric signal proportional to the torque amplitude. The temperature is controlled by an [formula] flow cryostat, and the magnetic field is provided by a rotatable resistive [formula] magnet with a maximum magnetic field of 1.4 T.

Magnetization measurements

Temperature dependence

The temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility χ = M/H (here M is the magnetization determined as magnetic moment per mol) for the crystal of EuFe2As2 in a field of μ0H = 0.01 T for H [formula] c and for H [formula] c is shown in Fig. 2a. In agreement with previous reports,[\cite=ZRen] [\cite=SJiang] the magnetic susceptibility for H [formula] [formula] ([formula]) and for H [formula] [formula] ([formula]), determined in the temperature range from 30 to 190 K (i.e., far above TAFM ≃ 19 K of the Eu moments up to TSDW ≃ 190 K of the Fe moments) is well described by the Curie-Weiss law:

[formula]

Here, [formula] denotes the Curie constant and θCW the Curie-Weiss temperature. Analyzing the data in Fig. 2a with Eq. (1) yields: C = 1853(15)×  10- 7 m3 K/mol, θCW = 19.74(8) K for H [formula] [formula] and C = 2127(23)×  10- 7 m3 K/mol, θCW = 20.69(4) K for H [formula] [formula]. The calculated effective magnetic moment is μeff ≃ 7.6 μB for H [formula] [formula] and μeff ≃ 8.3 μB for H [formula] [formula]. These estimates of μeff are close to the theoretical value of the magnetic moment of a free Eu2 + ion (μEu2 + = 7.94 μB). The positive value of θCW for both H [formula] [formula] and H [formula] [formula] is consistent with previous magnetization measurements,[\cite=ZRen] [\cite=SJiang] indicating that the direct interaction between the Eu2 + moments is ferromagnetic (FM). This is in agreement with the magnetic structure of EuFe2As2 suggested by zero field neutron diffraction measurements,[\cite=Xiao09] revealing that the intralayer arrangment of the Eu2 + spins is FM. The sharp increase of χ with decreasing temperature below 30 K also indicates a FM coupling between the Eu2 + moments. The Eu moments align with respect to the Fe moments along the a axis [\cite=Xiao09] as illustrated in Fig. 1.

With decreasing temperature from 19 K to 17 K, the susceptibility [formula] of single-crystal EuFe2As2 decreases rapidly and below 17 K the decrease of [formula] is less pronounced. On the other hand, [formula] decreases with decreasing temperature from 19 K to 17 K and remains constant below 17 K. Moreover, the values of [formula] and [formula] at 19 K are substantially different ([formula]/[formula] ≃ 1.33), already in a rather low magnetic field μ0H = 0.01 T (see Fig. 2a). Note that within the classical picture of an ideal antiferromagnet, the magnetic susceptibility χ in a magnetic field perpendicular to the easy axis is constant, and χ in a field parallel to the easy plane decreases linearly with decreasing temperature. In addition, for an antiferromagnet the values of χ at the antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition temperature are the same for both H [formula] [formula] and H [formula] [formula].[\cite=Blundell] The inset of Fig. 2a illustrates the temperature dependence of the difference between both susceptibilities [formula]. Note that below 19 K the quantity χd decreases with decreasing temperature and reaches zero at around 17 K. This behavior of χd(T) can be explained by invoking a transition from the high-temperature paramagnetic state to a FM state or to a C-AFM state at about 19 K. The transition from a FM or a C-AFM to an AFM state of the Eu2 + spins occurs only below 17 K. The pronounced increase of [formula] above 17 K indicates the appearence of a magnetic moment along the c-axis. Since [formula] is smaller than [formula] in the FM/C-AFM state, it is suggested that the ab-plane is the easy plane of this ordered state. In Fig. 2b the temperature dependences of [formula] and [formula] of single-crystal EuFe2As2 in a magnetic field of 0.3 T and 0.5 T (inset) are shown. Obviously, the AFM transition temperatures for H [formula] c (crossing point of [formula] and [formula]) and for H [formula] c (temperature at which [formula] starts to increase) are shifted to lower temperature with higher magnetic field (see Fig. 2a for comparison). However, at μ0H = 0.5 T the curves [formula] and [formula] do not cross in the investigated temperature range, indicating that the AFM state of the Eu2 + ions is suppressed in EuFe2As2 in magnetic fields H [formula] c exceeding μ0H ≃ 0.5 T. For H [formula] c the suppresion of the AFM state occurs in fields higher than μ0H ≃ 1.2 T, since above this field the susceptibility for H [formula] c is temperature dependent even at temperature as low as 2 K (see Fig. 3b). Importantly, the magnetic field at which the magnetic moments of the Eu sublattice saturates (i.e., the field at which the FM state is reached) is much higher than the field of suppresion of the AFM state. This implies that a FM state appears in a magnetic field higher than the field of suppression of antiferromagnetism and that those two transitions are distinguishable. The peak in the magnetic susceptibility at about 19 K in low fields (see Fig. 2) can be associated with the transition from a PM to a C-AFM state. This peak is shifted to lower temperature with applied magnetic field above μ0H ≃ 0.3 T for H [formula] c and above μ0H ≃ 0.5 T for H [formula] c (see Figs. 2b and 3b). Finally, we may conclude that a field-induced magnetic phase transition from an AFM via a C-AFM configuration to a FM state takes place below 17 K. Such a transition is visible even at the lowest temperature of 2 K reached in our experiment.

The magnetization M(T) in the FM state in the vicinity of the Curie temperature TC can be described by the power law:

[formula]

Here [formula] and M0 are empirical constants. Analyzing the data at 1.5 T with Eq.(2) yields: TC = 27.2(1) K and [formula] = 0.39(1) for both directions of the magnetic field (solid lines in the insets of Fig. 3a and 3b). It was found that TC increases gradually with increasing applied magnetic field for H [formula] [formula] and H [formula] [formula]. By extrapolating TC(H) to low fields the zero-field value of TC was found to be ≃ 19 K. The present values of TC(H) are in agreement with those reported by Xiao et al.[\cite=Xiao]

The temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility for the Co doped crystal EuFe1.8Co0.2As2 in an applied field of μ0H = 0.01 T for H [formula] c and H [formula] c is presented in Fig. 4. In the inset the temperature dependence of the difference between the susceptibilities for two field configurations [formula] is shown. Analyzing the susceptibility data above 30 K with Eq. (2) yields: C = 2108(32)×  10- 7 m3 K/mol, θCW = 21.86(6) K for H [formula] [formula] and C = 1915(34)×  10- 7 m3 K/mol, θCW = 20.67(7) K for H [formula] [formula]. Again θCW turns out to be positive. Like in the parent compound a sharp increase of χ below 30 K is observed, which is attributed to the in-plane FM coupling between the Eu2 + moments. Below 17 K the susceptibility [formula] starts to decrease with decreasing temperature, indicating the onset of an AFM transition of the Eu2 + spins. On the other hand, [formula] remains almost constant below 17 K. This suggests that the Eu2 + moments align along the ab-plane, similar to undoped EuFe2As2. However, for EuFe2As2 the AFM ordering temperature of the Eu2 + spins is about 2 K higher. Below 17 K, [formula] is significantly larger than [formula], even in magnetic fields as low as [formula] = 0.01 T (see Fig. 4). Thus, no crossing between [formula] and [formula] is observed (inset of Fig. 4), in contrast to the parent compound EuFe2As2 (see Fig. 2). Furthermore, [formula] is temperature dependent even at the lowest applied magnetic field. This is inconsistent with an AFM state with an easy c-axis. Hence, we suggest that for all temperatures below 17 K the ground state of the coupled Eu2 + spins in EuFe1.8Co0.2As2 is a C-AFM state with a FM component in the ab-plane. This implies that the magnetic configuration of the Eu moments is strongly influenced by the magnetization of the Fe-sublattice. This is consistent with previous NMR studies, revealing a strong coupling between the Eu and Fe2 - xCoxAs2 layers.[\cite=Guguchia]

The temperature dependences of [formula] and [formula] at different magnetic fields of single-crystal EuFe1.8Co0.2As2 are shown in Fig. 5. Zero field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC) susceptibilities [formula](T) measured in an applied field of μ0H = 0.001 T are shown in the inset of Fig. 5a. Below 17 K the ZFC and FC curves deviate from each other, indicating the presence of a C-AFM state of the Eu2 + moments. The data reveal a decrease of the C-AFM ordering temperature TC - AFM with increasing magnetic field for both field orientations, similar as for the parent compound EuFe2As2. However, the values for TC - AFM for EuFe1.8Co0.2As2 are substantially smaller than those for EuFe2As2.

Field dependence

The susceptibility investigations of the previous section clearly demonstrate that the system EuFe2 - xCoxAs2 (x = 0, 0.2) shows a rich variety of magnetic phases. In order to explore in detail the various magnetic field-induced phases, magnetization experiments were also performed as a function of the applied magnetic field at different temperatures.

The field dependence of the magnetization of single-crystal EuFe2As2 at different temperatures for H [formula] [formula] is shown in Fig. 6. In the inset the low field magnetization [formula] at 5 K is shown. [formula] increases almost linearly with increasing magnetic field H up to μ0H ≃ 0.45 T where a sudden increase of [formula] appears. Then [formula] further increases with increasing H, and finally saturates for μ0H ≥   0.8 T. The value of the saturation magnetization corresponds to an effective magnetic moment of 6.8 μB/f.u., which is close to gμBS = 7 μB/f.u. expected for Eu2 + moments. This result suggests that there is a metamagnetic (MM) [\cite=Luo] [\cite=Perry] transition at μ0HMM ≃ 0.45 T at 5 K in EuFe2As2, consistent with previous observations.[\cite=ZRen] [\cite=SJiang] Such a metamagnetic transition is characteristic for A-type antiferromagnetism in layered systems as, e.g., Na0.85CoO2 [\cite=Luo] and La2 - xSr1 + xMn2O7.[\cite=Kimura] Figure 6 shows that the MM transition shifts towards lower fields with increasing temperature. The values of the magnetic field at which the MM transition occurs is in agreement with the results obtained from the susceptibility for the AFM to C-AFM transition. Thus, we propose that the MM transition corresponds to the onset of a spin-flop transition [\cite=Blundell] from an AFM to a C-AFM state in EuFe2As2. However, no MM transition for H [formula] [formula] is detected in EuFe1.8Co0.2As2 (Fig. 7a). Both [formula] and [formula] first increase almost linearly with increasing H and then saturate at higher fields (Fig. 7). The absence of a MM transition in EuFe1.8Co0.2As2 is consistent with the susceptibility measurements presented above, suggesting that the Eu2 + moments exhibit a C-AFM ground state even at very low H. This conclusion is also supported by magnetic hysteresis measurements at 5 K performed in magnetic fields up to 0.5 T. As demonstrated in the inset of Fig. 7a the field dependence of [formula] at 5 K shows a well developed hysteresis for EuFe1.8Co0.2As2, in contrast to the parent compound EuFe2As2 where no hysteresis is observed.

Obviously, the presented susceptibility and magnetization measurements reveal a complex and rather sophisticated interplay of magnetic phases in the EuFe2 - xCoxAs2 system. Additional information on the complex magnetic phases in EuFe2 - xCoxAs2 is obtained from angular dependent magnetic torque studies presented in the next section.

Magnetic torque

In low magnetic fields the Eu2 + magnetic moments prefer to order antiferromagnetically in EuFe2As2. High magnetic fields reorient the magnetic moments, leading to various magnetic field induced phases. Magnetic torque allows to investigate multiple aspects of magnetic order as a function of the magnetic field with respect to the principal axes. Whereas magnetization provides direct information on the magnetic moment oriented along the field, magnetic torque directly probes the anisotropy of the susceptibility in magnetic systems.

The angular dependence of the magnetic torque τ of single-crystal EuFe2As2 measured at 13 K in various magnetic fields is presented in Fig. [\ref=torque13Kund]a. In Fig. [\ref=torque13Kund]b the same data are plotted in terms of τ  /  (μ0H2). The torque data below 0.3 T are of sinusoidal shape, following a simple angular dependence for a uniaxial antiferromagnet:[\cite=Weyeneth]

[formula]

Here, θ denotes the angle between the field H and the crystallographic c-axis, V is the volume of the sample, and [formula] and [formula] are the magnetic susceptibilities for H [formula] c and for H [formula] c, respectively. Above 0.3 T the shape of the torque signal changes drastically (see Fig. 8). For θ ≃ 90[formula](H almost parallel to the ab-plane) an additional torque signal appears, with an opposite sign relative to the AFM torque. Upon increasing the magnetic field this additional signal rises steeply and leads to a sign change of the torque signal for all angles θ. A similar behavior was observed in RbVBr3 [\cite=Tanaka1992] and was interpreted as the appearance of a weak field-induced magnetic moment. This additional contribution to the torque signal observed here is substantially larger than the AFM torque signal. This is consistent with the magnetization data (see Sec. III(A)), from which the presence of a C-AFM phase was concluded above 0.3 T at 13 K. The sign change of the torque signal is in agreement with the sign change of the quantity [formula], which was interpreted as a signature of a transition to a C-AFM state of the Eu2 + magnetic moments. It was shown previously [\cite=Dengler10] that EuFe2As2 exhibits a weak in-plane anisotropy. Since the in-plane anisotropy is much weaker than the out-of-plane anisotropy, this system can be treated approximately as a uniaxial anisotropic antiferromagnet. However, even a small in-plane anisotropy may lead to discrepancies between experimental results and theoretical predictions for a uniaxial anisotropic ferromagnet. Particularly, the torque signal of the AFM state shown in Fig. 8a is shifted by Δθ ~   10[formula] with respect to one of the C-AFM state (see Fig 8b). A similar phase shift Δθ was observed in [formula] - (BETS)2FeCl4 [\cite=Sasaki2001] and interpreted as a change of the easy-axis. However, here the phase shift appears to indicate a crystallographic multi-domain state, due to a twinning of the crystal in the AFM state.

Figure [\ref=torque20Kund]a shows the measured magnetic torque for the same EuFe2As2 single crystal at 20 K, where according to the magnetization results the AFM regime has disappeared. Consistently, no AFM torque signal is observed. Instead, the magnetic torque amplitude increases with H2 and saturates at higher H. Such a behavior is characteristic for a paramagnet. Consistently, the quantity τ  /  (μ0H2) plotted in Fig. 9b decreases with increasing field.

In Fig. [\ref=3Dtorque] the scaled magnetic torque τ/(μ0H2) for EuFe2As2 and EuFe1.8Co0.2As2 is shown in a color map for the representative temperatures of 13 K, 17 K, and 20 K as a function of angle θ and field H. Note that τ/(μ0H2) is scaling according to the magnetic susceptibility. As seen in Fig. [\ref=3Dtorque]a the low field regime of undoped EuFe2As2 at 13 K is dominated by the AFM state, whereas for higher fields, the C-AFM state appears abruptly along a clearly angular dependent boundary line (dotted line), demonstrating the anisotropy of this magnetically ordered system. At 17 K (Fig. [\ref=3Dtorque]b) the AFM phase is not present, consistent with the conclusions from the above susceptibility measurements. At 20 K (Fig. [\ref=3Dtorque]c) the signal is clearly sinusoidal, consistent with FM behavior. In order to induce a canting of a planar antiferromagnetically ordered subsystem, the in-plane component of the magnetic field [formula] must surpass the in-plane magnetization [formula] in one of the two magnetic sublattices:

[formula]

Here, M is the saturation magnetization of the magnetic sublattice, [formula] its out-of-plane component, and A is a constant. Taking into account

[formula]

where [formula] is the suceptibility of the total Eu2 + magnetic sublattice, we obtain for the boundary condition:

[formula]

Solving this equality for H yields the angle dependent canting field:

[formula]

Interestingly, the resulting Hcant(θ) is analog to the expression for the angular dependence of the upper critical field Hc2(θ) in a type II superconductor.[\cite=GinzburgLandau] Hence, Eq. ([\ref=cantingtorque]) can be simplified according to

[formula]

where [formula] is the in-plane canting field, [formula] its anisotropy parameter, and [formula] the out-of-plane canting field. This shape of the angular dependence of the transition between the AFM and C-AFM phase in the (H, θ) diagram is represented by the dashed line in Fig. [\ref=3Dtorque]a. It describes the experimental torque data rather well, with the parameters [formula](13 K) ≃ 0.42(2) T and γcant ≃ 2.0(2). This yields an estimate of the canting field parallel to the c-axis [formula](13 K) ≃ 0.84(6) T.

The low field torque signal of EuFe1.8Co0.2As2 at 20 K (Fig. 10f) shows a shape typical for an anisotropic paramagnet. However, the anisotropy of the system is quite quickly suppressed with increasing magnetic field, which may indicate a transformation of the paramagnetic state to a short range ordered state at relatively low field. It might be caused by large fluctuations of the magnetic moments in the vicinity of the transition from a disordered PM state to an ordered one in EuFe1.8Co0.2As2. Furthermore, at low temperatures we do not observe any indication of a field induced transition from the AFM to the C-AFM state (Fig. 10d-e). Therefore, we conclude that for EuFe1.8Co0.2As2 even at the lowest magnetic field a transition from a PM to a C-AFM state takes place with decreasing temperature, in agreement with the above magnetization data.

DISCUSSION

In Fig. 11 the results of the susceptibility, magnetization, and magnetic torque experiments are summarized. They are discussed in terms of the phase diagram of the Eu2 + magnetic sublattice of EuFe2As2 and EuFe1.8Co0.2As2 for H [formula] c and H [formula] c.

EuFe2As2

For the parent compound EuFe2As2 four different magnetic phases were identified (see Fig. 11a and b): a paramagnetic (PM), an antiferromagnetic (AFM), a canted antiferromagnetic (C-AFM), and a ferromagnetic (FM) phase. The determination of the corresponding transition temperatures and fields is described in Sec. III. The present experiments suggest a C-AFM order of the Eu2 + spins in EuFe2As2 in the temperature range between 17 K and 19 K, while below 17 K an AFM structure is proposed. We suggest that at low temperatures the system can be well described with a uniaxial model with easy plane and A-type AFM order. By applying a magnetic field within the AFM phase, a transition from AFM order via a canted configuration to a FM structure is observed. The observed TMM(H) at which the metamagnetic (MM) transition occurs (open symbols in Fig. 11a) is in agreement with the results obtained from the susceptibility for the AFM to C-AFM transition (black filled symbols in Fig. 11a). Thus, we propose that the MM transition corresponds to a spin-flop transition from an AFM to a C-AFM state in EuFe2As2. The critical magnetic field Hcr(T) at which the magnetic moment in the Eu sublattice saturates was determined at different temperatures. The values of Hcr extrapolated to zero temperature were found to be [formula](0) ≃ 0.85 T and [formula](0) ≃ 1.5 T for H [formula] [formula] and H [formula] [formula], respectively. By analyzing the shape of the angular dependence of Hcr(θ) shown in Fig. 10a, we may conclude that the in-plane component of the magnetic field is responsible for the canting of the spins.

The magnetic ordering of the Eu2 + moments at low temperatures is consistent with the magnetic structure established by neutron diffraction at 2.5 K.[\cite=Xiao09] Note that in previous reports [\cite=ZRen] [\cite=SJiang] a possible C-AFM state in the temperature range 17 K ≤   T ≤   19 K was not discussed. To our knowledge no neutron data for the magnetic configuration of the Eu sublattice in this temperature range is available.

EuFe1.8Co0.2As2

The corresponding magnetic phase diagrams for Co-doped EuFe1.8Co0.2As2 are shown in Fig. 11c and d. The magnetic ordering temperature of ≃ 17 K is only about 2 K lower as compared to the parent compound. However, in the Co-doped EuFe1.8Co0.2As2, no signatures of a low-field and low-temperature AFM state of the Eu2 + moments was found. Only a C-AFM phase (with a FM component in the ab-plane) is present at low fields and low temperatures. The ordering temperature TC - AFM decreases with increasing magnetic field, similar to the parent compound (see Fig. 11a and b). The critical magnetic field Hcr at which the Eu magnetic ordering is saturated was determined for different temperatures, and the extrapolated zero-temperature values were found to be: [formula](0) ≃ 0.43 T and [formula](0) ≃ 0.58 T for H [formula] [formula] and H [formula] [formula], respectively. These values of μ0Hcr are much smaller than those obtained for the parent compound. Moreover, the magnetic anisotropy γcr = [formula](0)/[formula](0) ≃ 1.35 of Co-doped EuFe1.8Co0.2As2 is also smaller than γcr ≃ 1.76 of the parent compound.

It was concluded from different experiments [\cite=SJiang] [\cite=Dengler10] [\cite=Ying10] [\cite=ZRen09] [\cite=Guguchia] that there is a strong coupling between the localized Eu2 + spins and the conduction electrons of the two-dimensional (2D) Fe2As2 layers. Recently, direct experimental evidence for a strong interlayer coupling was obtained by means of 75As NMR,[\cite=Guguchia] revealing a magnetic exchange interaction between the localized Eu 4f moments which is mediated by the itinerant Fe 3d electrons. However, the direct interaction of the Eu moments and the magnetic moments in Fe sublattice cannot be neglected. Only a combination of both interactions can further elucidate the C-AFM ground state observed in the parent compound EuFe2As2 as well as in the Co-doped system EuFe1.8Co0.2As2 (see Fig. 11).

Note that the present results for EuFe1.8Co0.2As2, exhibiting a SDW ground state below 60 K, [\cite=Ying10] reveal a C-AFM structure of the Eu spins with a FM component in the ab-plane. This finding confirms previous assumptions that for materials in which the Fe ions are in the SDW ground state (such as EuFe2As2) the direction of the Eu magnetic moments is in the ab-plane.[\cite=Xiao09] [\cite=Nowik] On the other hand, in the case of non-magnetic Fe ground states, like in superconducting EuFe2 - xCoxAs2 compounds, where the SDW magnetic state is totally suppresed, the direction of the Eu magnetic moments is parallel to the c-axis.[\cite=NowikF] [\cite=Feng] [\cite=NowikFel] [\cite=NowikFelner]

CONCLUSIONS

The magnetic properties of single crystals of EuFe2As2 and EuFe1.8Co0.2As2 were studied by means of susceptibility, magnetization, and magnetic torque investigations. The susceptibility and magnetization experiments performed for various temperatures and magnetic fields along the crystallographic axes provided information on the magnetic structure of the studied crystals. In addition, the evolution of the magnetic structure as a function of the tilting angle of the field and the crystallographic axes is studied by magnetic torque experiments. The phase diagrams for the ordering of the Eu2 + magnetic sublattice with respect to temperature, magnetic field and the angle between the magnetic field and the crystallographic c-axis in EuFe2 - xCoxAs2 are determined and discussed. The present investigations reveal a complex and sophisticated interplay of magnetic phases in EuFe2 - xCoxAs2. The magnetic ordering temperature of the Eu2 + moments remains nearly unchanged upon Co-doping. However, unlike the parent compound, in which the Eu2 + moments order antiferromagnetically at low temperatures, the Co-doped system EuFe1.8Co0.2As2 exhibits a C-AFM state with a FM component in the ab-plane. The magnetic anisotropy γcr becomes smaller as a result of Co-doping. This implies that the magnetic configuration of the Eu moments is strongly influenced by the magnetic moments of the Fe-sublattice, where superconductivity takes place for a certain range of Co-doping. A detailed knowledge of the interplay between the Eu2 + moments and magnetism of the Fe sublattice is important to understand the role of magnetism of the localized Eu2 + moments for the occurence of supercondcutivity in EuFe2 - xCoxAs2.
