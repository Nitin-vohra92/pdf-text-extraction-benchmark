HERA PRECISION MEASUREMENTS AND IMPACT FOR LHC PREDICTIONS

Combined H1 and ZEUS Cross Section Measurements

The main information on proton structure functions comes from the Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) collider experiments H1 and ZEUS at HERA. Measurements at HERA go well beyond the phase space accessible by fixed target experiments with an extended kinematic range of 0.045  <  Q2  <  30  000 GeV2 and [formula]. To further benefit from the precision of the measurements the H1 and ZEUS cross sections are combined, resulting in the most consistent and precise DIS inclusive double differential cross-section measurement of neutral and charged current e±p scattering to date [\cite=herapdf]. The data combination "procedure" has been repeated to include as well the preliminary high precision measurements at high Q2 from the second run period of HERA. Therefore, these accurate measurements can be used as the sole input to the QCD analysis to determine the proton parton distribution functions (PDFs) as described in the following sections, which can be used then for precise predictions for LHC processes.

QCD Analysis settings

HERA PDFs are determined from QCD fits to HERA data alone. Only the region where perturbative QCD is valid, data above [formula] GeV2 are used in the central fit. The HERA data have a minimum invariant mass of the hadronic system, W, of 15 GeV, such that they are in a kinematic region where there is no sensitivity to non-perturbative effects common to fixed target data.

The fit procedure starts by parametrising PDFs at a starting scale Q20 = 1.9 ~ GeV2, chosen to be below the charm mass threshold. The QCD settings are optimised for HERA measurements of proton structure functions which are dominated by gamma exchange, therefore the parametrised PDFs are the valence distributions xuv and xdv, the gluon distribution xg, and the u-type and d-type sea quark distributions xŪ, x, where xŪ  =  xū, x  =  x + xs̄. Using a simple parametrisation form with the normalisation parameters constrained by the QCD sum-rules and relying on additional assumptions [\cite=herapdf] the number of free paramaters reduces to 10 for the fits to HERA I data. However, the more data become available, the more constraining assumptions can be released, therefore the number of free parameters once HERA II data are added is increased, allowing for more freedom to the gluon and valence distributions, HERAPDF1.5f. For example addition of the preliminary combined charm data, or jet data from H1 [\cite=jetsh11] [\cite=jetsh12] and ZEUS [\cite=jetsz1] [\cite=jetsz2] allows for more flexibility of the gluon distribution. The PDFs are then evolved using the DGLAP evolution equations [\cite=qcdnum] at NLO and NNLO in the [formula] scheme with the renormalisation and factorisation scales set to Q2. The QCD predictions for the structure functions are obtained by convoluting the PDFs with the calculable coefficient functions taking into account mass effects for the heavy quarks based on the general mass variable flavour scheme [\cite=tr]. The PDF uncertainties at HERA are classified in three categories: experimental, model, and parametrisation. The consistency of the input data set and its small systematic uncertainties enables us to calculate the experimental uncertainties on the PDFs using the χ2 tolerance Δχ2 = 1. The model uncertainties are evaluated by varying the input assumptions, as performed in [\cite=herapdf]. The parametrisation uncertainty is estimated as an envelope which is formed as a maximal deviation at each x value from the central fit.

Results and Comparisons

The inclusion of the precise high Q2 preliminary HERA II data in the QCD fits results in HERAPDF1.5. Figure [\ref=Fig:1] shows the comparison between HERAPDF1.5 and HERAPDF1.0 which is based on HERA I data alone. The impact is noticeable especially in the high x region, where the valence contribution dominates. In addition, a meticulous study has been performed to estimate the uncertainties for the NNLO HERAPDF set, also shown in Figure [\ref=Fig:1], where the new NNLO set is compared to the HERAPDF1.0 NNLO. To answer the question about implications of the new PDF sets on the Higgs exclusion limits from Tevatron, Figure [\ref=Fig:2] shows a more explicit comparison of the gluon distribution at high x between HERAPDF and MSTW08 sets at NNLO. The HERAPDF1.5 NNLO set yields a harder gluon at high x compared to the HERAPDF1.0 NNLO set, which is prefered by the Tevatron jet data. The differences are mostly due to the use of a more flexible functional form made possible via the availability of a more precise data.

Another important result is related to the determination of the strong coupling. New results from HERA based solely on the inclusive DIS measurements can not yet pin down the value of αS as shown in Figure [\ref=Fig:2] (right), where a scan in χ2 as function of strong coupling is shown. However, as soon as the jet data are included in the QCD fit, resulting in HERAPDF1.6, it can be seen that the strong coupling is well constrainted. In fact, the addition of the HERA jet data into the fit allows the strong coupling and gluon to be simultaneously constrained. Figure [\ref=Fig:3] shows the impact of the inclusion of the jet data on the gluon distribution when the fit is performed with the strong coupling as a free parameter. As a result, the HERA data prefer a rather larger value for [formula]exp)  ±  0.0007(mod)  ±  0.0012(had)+ 0.0045- 0.0036(th).

In addition, the inclusion of the preliminary HERA charm data provides constraints for the optimal value of the charm mass used in theory models. It has been observed that QCD fits without charm data have only a small sensitivity to the value of the charm mass. However, there is a strong preference for a particular mc once charm data is included. This study has been performed for various schemes, such as those used in the global fit analyses of MSTW08 and CTEQ. The results conclude that each scheme describes the data well at the corresponding best value of the mc. It is interesting to observe that differences in the PDF sets correspond to differences in the charm mass used in different schemes [\cite=myslides].

All HERAPDF sets derived solely from ep measurements are able to give a good prediction of the Z and W at Tevatron from the p processes, and provide a competitive description to pp processes at the LHC as well.

Summary

HERA provides accurate determinations of the proton structure and can predict related Standard Model processes. Additional preliminary combined measurements from HERA II allow the high x region to be better constrained resulting in a more precise HERA PDF set, HERAPDF1.5 at NLO and NNLO in αS with a detailed analysis of the uncertainties. The HERAPDF sets, which are based solely on ep data also describe the Tevatron data well and provide competitive predictions to the LHC processes. Inclusion of the HERA jet data allows for a precise determination of the strong coupling, for which HERA data prefers a rather larger value of αS. In addition, inclusion of the preliminary combined HERA charm data provides constraints on the optimal value for the charm mass used in theory models and it may account for some of the differences among global PDF fits. Therefore, HERAPDF provides a large variety of meticulous studies based on new measurements from HERA for accurate predictions at the LHC [\cite=website].
