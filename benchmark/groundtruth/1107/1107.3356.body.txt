Self-adjoint commuting differential operators and commutative subalgebras of the Weyl algebra

Abstract. In this paper we study self-adjoint commuting ordinary differential operators. We find sufficient conditions when an operator of fourth order commuting with an operator of order 4g + 2 is self-adjoint. We introduce an equation on potentials V(x),W(x) of the self-adjoint operator L = (∂2x + V)2 + W and some additional data. With the help of this equation we find the first example of commuting differential operators of rank two corresponding to a spectral curve of arbitrary genus. These operators have polynomial coefficients and define commutative subalgebras of the first Weyl algebra.

Introduction

The problem of finding commuting differential operators is a classical problem of differential equations (for the first results see [\cite=W]-[\cite=BC]). In the case of operators of rank greater than one, this problem has not been solved until now. In this paper we study self-adjoint commuting ordinary differential operators. One of the main results of this paper is the following. We find an example of commuting differential operators of rank two corresponding to spectral curves of arbitrary genus.

If two differential operators

[formula]

commute, then there is a nonzero polynomial R(z,w) such that R(Ln,Lm) = 0 (see [\cite=BC]). The curve Γ defined by R(z,w) = 0 is called the spectral curve. This curve parametrizes common eigenvalues of the operators. If

[formula]

then (z,w)∈Γ. For almost all (z,w)∈Γ the dimension of the space of common eigenfunctions ψ is the same. The dimension is called the rank. The rank equals the greatest common divisor of m and n.

In this paper we consider only commuting ordinary differential operators whose spectral curves are smooth. Commutative rings of such operators were classified by Krichever [\cite=K1], [\cite=K]. The ring is determined by the spectral curve and some additional spectral data. If the rank is one, then the spectral data define commuting operators by explicit formulas (see [\cite=K1]). In the case of operators of rank greater than one there are the following results. Krichever and Novikov [\cite=KN1], [\cite=KN2] using the method of deformation of Tyurin parameters found operators of rank two corresponding to an elliptic spectral curves. These operators were studied in the papers [\cite=GN]-[\cite=Deh]. Mokhov [\cite=Mokh], using the same method found operators of rank three also corresponding to elliptic spectral curves. Besides this there are examples of operators of rank grater than one corresponding to spectral curves of genus 2,3 and 4 (see [\cite=M1]-[\cite=Z]).

The main results of this paper are the following. We consider a pair L4,L4g + 2 of commuting differential operators of rank two whose spectral curve is a hyperelliptic curve Γ of genus g

[formula]

Operators L4 and L4g + 2 satisfy the equation (L4g + 2)2 = Fg(L4). The curve Γ has a holomorphic involution

[formula]

Common eigenfunctions of L4 and L4g + 2 satisfy the second order differential equation [\cite=K]

[formula]

The coefficients χ0(x,P),χ1(x,P) are rational functions on Γ with 2g simple poles depending on x, χ0 has also an additional simple pole at infinity. These functions satisfy Krichever's equations (see below). To find operators L4,L4g + 2 it is enough to find χ0,χ1.

It is not difficult to prove that if χ1 is invariant under the involution σ, then the operator L4 is self-adjoint. S.P. Novikov has proposed the conjecture that the inverse is also true. In this paper we prove this conjecture.

Theorem 1 The operator L4 is self-adjoint if and only if

[formula]

At g = 1 Theorem 1 was proved by Grinevich and Novikov [\cite=GN].

Let us assume that the operator L4 is self-adjoint

[formula]

then the functions χ0,χ1 have simple poles at some points

[formula]

In the next theorem we find the form of χ0(x,P),χ1(x,P).

Theorem 2 If operator L4 is self-adjoint, then

[formula]

where [formula]. Functions Q,V,W satisfy the equation

[formula]

where Q',Q'',Q(k) mean ∂xQ,∂2xQ,∂kxQ.

To find self-adjoint operators L4,L4g + 2 it is enough to solve the equation ([\ref=e1]).

In this paper we find partial solutions of the equation for arbitrary g. These solutions correspond to operators with polynomial coefficients.

Theorem 3 The operator

[formula]

commutes with a differential operator [formula] of order 4g + 2. The operators [formula] [formula] are operators of rank two. For generic values of parameters (α0,α1,α2,α3) the spectral curve is a nonsingular hyperelliptic curve of genus g.

If g = 1, α1  =  α2 = 0, α3 = 1, then the operators [formula] coincide with the famous Dixmier operators [\cite=D] whose spectral curve is an elliptic curve. Operators [formula] define commutative subalgebras in the first Weyl algebra A1. Theorem 3 means that the equation [formula] has nonconstant solutions X,Y∈A1 for some ci. It is easy to see that the group Aut(A1) preserves the space of all such solutions. It would be very interesting to describe the orbits of Aut(A1) in the space of solutions under the action of Aut(A1). This gives a chance to compare End(A1) and Aut(A1) (the Dixmier conjecture is: End(A1) = Aut(A1)).

In Section 2 we recall the method of deformations of Tyurin parameters. In Sections 3-5 we prove Theorems 1-3.

Operators of rank l > 1

Common eigenfunctions of commuting differential operators are Baker-Akhiezer functions. Let me recall the definition of the Baker-Akhiezer function at l > 1 [\cite=K]. We take the spectral data

[formula]

where Γ is a Riemann surface of genus g, q is a fixed point on Γ, k- 1 is a local parameter near q,

[formula]

is a set of smooth functions, [formula] is a divisor on Γ, v is a set of vectors

[formula]

The pair (γ,v) is called the Tyurin parameters. The Tyurin parameters define a stable holomorphic vector bundle on Γ of rank l and degree lg with holomorphic sections [formula]. The points [formula] are the points of the linear dependence

[formula]

The vector-function [formula] is defined by the following properties.

1. In the neighbourhood of q the vector-function ψ has the form

[formula]

where [formula], the matrix Ψ0 satisfies the equation

[formula]

2. The components of ψ are meromorphic functions on [formula] with the simple poles [formula], and

[formula]

For the rational function f(P) on Γ with the unique pole of order n at q there is a linear differential operator L(f) of order ln  such that

[formula]

For two such functions f(P),g(P) operators L(f), L(g) commute.

The main difficulty to construct operators of rank l > 1 is the fact that the Baker-Akhiezer function is not found explicitly. But the operators can be found by the method of deformation of Tyurin parameters.

The common eigenfunctions of commuting differential operators of rank l satisfy the linear differential equation of order l

[formula]

Coefficients χi are rational functions on Γ [\cite=K] with simple poles [formula], and with the following expansions in the neighbourhood of q

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Let k - γi(x) be a local parameter near Pi(x). Then

[formula]

Functions cij(x),dij(x) satisfy the following equations [\cite=K].

Theorem 4

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

where

[formula]

To find χi one should solve equations ([\ref=w1])-([\ref=w3]).

Proof of Theorem 1

In the case of operators of rank two the common eigenfunctions of L4 and L4g + 2 satisfy equation ([\ref=u1]). In the neighbourhood of q we have the expansions

[formula]

Functions χ0,χ1 have 2g simple poles [formula], and by Theorem 4

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Let Γ be the hyperelliptic spectral curve ([\ref=v1]), q =   ∞  ∈Γ, [formula].

Let us find coefficients of the operator of order 4 corresponding to z, L4ψ = zψ.

Lemma 1 The operator L4  =  ∂4x + f2(x)∂2x + f1(x)∂x + f0(x) has the following coefficients:

[formula]

Operator L4 is self-adjoint if and only if b1 = 0, herewith L4 = (∂2x + V(x))2 + W(x), where V(x) =  - a0(x), W =  - 2a1(x).

Proof. From ([\ref=u1]) it follows that the fourth derivative of ψ is

[formula]

With the help of ([\ref=u1]) and the last equality we rewrite L4ψ = zψ in the form

[formula]

where

[formula]

[formula]

This gives

[formula]

From ([\ref=u3]) we have

[formula]

[formula]

From here we find the coefficients of L4.

Operator L4 is self-adjoint if f1 = f2', i.e. at b1 = 0. Lemma 1 is proved.

If χ1 satisfies ([\ref=u2]) then [formula] hence, by Lemma 1 L4 is self-adjoint.

Let us prove the inverse part of Theorem 1. We assume that L4 is self-adjoint

[formula]

If ψ1,ψ2∈Ker(L4 - z), then

[formula]

Hence, on the space Ker(L4 - z) the following skew-symmetric bilinear form

[formula]

[formula]

is defined. Let ψ1(x,P),ψ2(x,P) satisfy the equation ([\ref=u1]). Using

[formula]

we get

[formula]

Since ψ1,ψ2 satisfy the second order differential equation ([\ref=u1]) we have,

[formula]

[formula]

where g1(z,w),g2(z,w) are some functions on Γ. Let us represent χ1 in the form

[formula]

where G1,G2 are rational functions on Γ. Let

[formula]

then

[formula]

From the last identity it follows that for arbitrary x = x1,x = x2 the function

[formula]

is a rational function on Γ. This is possible only if

[formula]

or equivalent G2 = 0. Hence, χ1 = G1(x,z). This means that χ1 is invariant under the involution σ. Thus, Theorem 1 is proved.

Proof of Theorem 2

Assume that χ1 is invariant under σ, then by ([\ref=u3])-([\ref=u5]) we have

[formula]

[formula]

where Hi(x),κ(x) are some functions. In the neighbourhood of q the function χ0 has the expansion

[formula]

Hence, by Lemma 1

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

Let us substitute χ0,χ1 into ([\ref=e11]). From P2 = 0 we get [formula], where s is a constant. From P1 = z we get

[formula]

[formula]

The last identity is possible only if s = 0 because Q is a polynomial in z. Theorem 2 is proved.

Let us differentiate ([\ref=e1]) in x and divide the result by Q. We get the following equation.

Corollary 1 The functions Q,W,V satisfy the equation

[formula]

Let us substitute z = γj in ([\ref=e1]). It gives

[formula]

We get g - 1 equations on [formula].

Corollary 2 The functions [formula] satisfy the equations

[formula]

Proof of Theorem 3

Let

[formula]

[formula]

Let us consider the equations ([\ref=e1]) where V,W are potentials of the operator [formula]

[formula]

[formula]

We prove that the nonlinear equation ([\ref=e21]) has a polynomial solution Q(x,z) of degree g in z and degree g in x for some polynomial Fg(z). After that we prove that χ0,χ1 satisfy ([\ref=u6]) for the curve w2 = Fg(z). The functions χ0,χ1 have required asymptotic ([\ref=u3]) in q =   ∞  . From here it follows that [formula] commutes with an operator of order 4g + 2 corresponding to the rational function w on Γ with the unique pole of order 2g + 1 at q.

Lemma 2 Equation ([\ref=e21]) has a solution of the form

[formula]

for some polynomial Fg(z) of degree 2g + 1.

Proof. Let us differentiate both sides of ([\ref=e21]) with respect to x and divide the result by Q

[formula]

[formula]

We find a solution of ([\ref=e23]) as a polynomial in x

[formula]

From ([\ref=e23]) we have

[formula]

[formula]

where 0  ≤  s < g - 1, δg is a constant, and δs = 0 at s > g. In particular

[formula]

From ([\ref=e25]) it follows that Q is a polynomial of degree g in z, and up to the multiplication by a constant, the polynomial Q has the form ([\ref=e22]). The right-hand side of ([\ref=e21]) has degree 2g + 1. Lemma 2 is proved.

Lemma 3 The polynomial Q has no multiple root in z

[formula]

Proof. Let us represent Q in the form

[formula]

where QH is a homogeneous polynomial in x,z

[formula]

and  deg < g. Since [formula], the polynomial Q has no constant roots (i.e. γi  ≠  const).

Let us note that Q has no multiple roots of order higher than 2. Indeed, if Q = (z - γi(x))p, p > 2, then from ([\ref=e21]) Fg(γi(x)) = 0, but this is impossible.

If Q has multiple roots, then QH also has multiple roots. This follows from the following fact. The discriminant of Q is a polynomial [formula] in x. The discriminant of QH is bNxN, so if the discriminant of Q is equal to zero, then the discriminant of QH is also zero.

From ([\ref=e25]) it follows that

[formula]

and that QH satisfies the equation

[formula]

Let us multiply this equation by QH and integrate in x. We get

[formula]

where g(z) is a polynomial of degree 2g + 1 in z.

From the last equation it follows that if QH has multiple roots, then the polynomial g(z) has the same roots. However, this is impossible, because all roots of g(z) are constant, but QH has not constant roots. Lemma 3 is proved.

Lemma 4 If [formula], the curve w2 = Fg(z) is nonsingular, where [formula] is some Zariski open set.

Proof. The idea of the proof is the following. We represent Fg in the form

[formula]

and prove that F0g(z) + α3F1g(z) has not multiple roots. Therefore, Fg(z) has not multiple roots for small α3, and consequently for [formula].

Let us consider ([\ref=e24])-([\ref=e26]). We put δg  =  αg3, then

[formula]

Moreover, from ([\ref=e24]) it follows that Q has the form

[formula]

Let us note that from ([\ref=e26]) it follows that

[formula]

Let us substitute ([\ref=e27]) into ([\ref=e21]). We get

[formula]

so,

[formula]

To prove Lemma 4 it is enough to prove that p0(z)z and α1p1(z) + 2q0(z)z have no common roots.

Let us find pi and qi. For this we again substitute ([\ref=e27]) into ([\ref=e23]) and find the coefficients at αi + 13xi and αi + 23xi. These coefficients must be equal to zero. It gives us

[formula]

[formula]

where 0  ≤  i  ≤  g - 2. Hence

[formula]

where Ai is a constant. Thus to prove that p0(z)z and α1p1(z) + 2q0(z)z have no common roots we should prove that [formula] are not roots of q0(z). Assume that q0( - α2s2) = 0 for some s, 2  ≤  s  ≤  g. From ([\ref=e28]) it follows that pk( - α2s2) = 0 at 0  ≤  k < s, pk( - α2s2)  ≠  0 at k  ≥  s, and from ([\ref=e29]) it follows that qk( - α2s2) = 0 at 0  ≤  k  ≤  s - 2.

First of all we consider the case s = g. If i = g - 2, then ([\ref=e29]) yields

[formula]

Hence, if q0( - α2g2) = 0, then qg - 2( - α2g2) = 0, but this is impossible, since pg = 1, so s < g.

Formulas ([\ref=e28]), ([\ref=e29]) at i = s - 2,i = s - 1 give us

[formula]

[formula]

Let z be -  α2s2. After the simplification we have

[formula]

This is impossible, hence [formula] and F0g(z) + α3F2g(z) has no multiple roots. Lemma 4 is proved.

Functions χ0,χ1 are rational functions on the curve w2 = Fg(z). Let [formula] be a local parameter near q =   ∞  . Functions χ0,χ1 have asymptotic ([\ref=u2]). By Lemma, 3 χ0 and χ1 have simple poles [formula] Let us choose in the neighbourhood of P±i the local parameter z - γi(x).

Lemma 5 Functions χ0,χ1 satisfy the equation ([\ref=u6]).

Proof. From ([\ref=e20]) we have

[formula]

for some di,1(x). Function χ1 has simple poles at γi(x), thus

[formula]

for some vi,0(x),di,0(x). By our construction χ0, χ1 satisfy ([\ref=e11]). Let us substitute χ0, χ1 in ([\ref=e11]). We get

[formula]

Hence di,0(x),di,1(x),vi,0(x) satisfy ([\ref=u6]). Lemma 5 and Theorem 3 are proved.

Operator [formula] commuting with [formula] can be found from [formula]. For the simplicity of the formulas we restrict ourselves to the case α1  =  α2 = 0,α3 = 1. Let us introduce the notations: H = ∂2x + x3  +  α0, 〈A,B〉 = AB + BA.
