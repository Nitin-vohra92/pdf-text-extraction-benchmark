Frobenius' result on simple groups of order [formula]

Background

Let p be a prime and [formula] be the group of 2 by 2 determinant 1 matrices with entries in [formula]. The quotient, [formula], of [formula] by [formula] is for p > 2 a group of order [formula]. Galois [\cite=2] introduced and studied this group; in his 1832 letter to Auguste Chevalier he says that it is easily shown to be simple for p > 3. (There are many proofs of simplicity. I'll give a short one in section [\ref=section6].) In 1902 Frobenius [\cite=1] classified certain transitive permutation groups on p + 1 letters up to permutation isomorphism, and deduced as a corollary that [formula] is the "only" simple group of order [formula].

Frobenius' proof of this very early result in the classification of the finite simple groups, though elementary, isn't well-known and hasn't found its way into textbooks. In this note I give a version of it, based on Sylow theory and the cyclicity of [formula]. This version could perhaps be presented in an undergraduate honors algebra course. I thank Jim Humphreys for his close reading of this note, his encouragement, and his expository suggestions.

Another description of [formula] will be useful. Let V be the space of column vectors, [formula], with entries in [formula]. [formula] acts on the set consisting of the p + 1 one-dimensional subspaces of V. We identify this space with [formula] as follows. Given a subspace with generator [formula], map it to the element [formula] of [formula]. Since [formula] is mapped to [formula] by [formula] and to [formula] by [formula], the images of [formula] and [formula] are the translation z  →  z + 1, and the involution [formula]. Easy arguments with row and column operations show that [formula] and [formula] generate [formula]. Since the kernel of the action of [formula] consists of [formula] and [formula], [formula] identifies with the transitive group of permutations of [formula] generated by z  →  z + 1 and [formula].

I'll prove the following (version of a) result of Frobenius, and its easy corollary:

The theorem is trivial when p = 3. For now |G| = 12 and G is a permutation group on 4 elements. So G consists of the even permutations, and thus contains (0  ∞  )(12). In the following sections we prove the theorem for p > 3, but now we show how the corollary follows. Suppose G is a simple group of order [formula] with p > 3. Then p divides |G| and G has mp + 1 p-Sylow subgroups; since G is simple m > 0. Furthermore [formula] is an integer [formula] and so is ≥  p - 1; it follows that m = 1. G acts on the set S consisting of the p + 1 p-Sylows, and by Sylow theory the action is transitive. Since G is simple, the action is faithful. Select an element σ of G of order p. This element acts by a p-cycle on S; denote the element it fixes by ∞  . We may label the remaining elements of S with tags in [formula] so that σ is the translation [formula], z  →  z + 1, of [formula]. If we view G as a group of permutations of [formula], the hypotheses of the classification theorem are satisfied. Since G has no normal subgroup of order 8, we're in the situation of (a), and we conclude that G is isomorphic to [formula].

Easy facts about [formula]

For the rest of this note G is a group satisfying the hypotheses of the classification theorem. Then the stabilizer, G∞, of ∞   in G contains the translations and so is transitive on [formula]. Consequently:

G is doubly transitive on [formula].

K is the subgroup of G consisting of elements fixing 0 and ∞  . q consists of the elements of G interchanging 0 and ∞  . [formula] is the stabilizer of {0,  ∞  } in G.

Since G is doubly transitive, [formula]. Double transitivity also shows that q is non-empty. So K is of index 2 in H, and [formula].

R is the set of squares in [formula], N the set of non-squares.

Since [formula] is cyclic, so is R. Furthermore, [formula].

K is cyclic and consists of the maps z  →  az, a in R.

No element of G fixes more than 2 letters.

[formula]. The Sylow theorems then show that the group of translations is the unique p-Sylow subgroup of G∞, and so is normal in G∞. So for τ in G∞, [formula] for some a in [formula]. If τ is in K, τ(0) = 0. Since τ(z + 1) = τz + a, τ(z) = az for all z in [formula]. Now the maps z  →  az, a in [formula], form a cyclic group of order p - 1. Since K is a subgroup of that group of order [formula] we get (1).

Suppose next that τ  ≠  e fixes 3 or more letters. By double transitivity we may assume that 2 of these letters are 0 and ∞  , so that τ is in K. But the only map z  →  az fixing a third letter is e.

Suppose τ∈q.

If [formula], - 1∈R and τ stabilizes R and N.

If [formula], - 1∈N and τ interchanges R and N.

By Lemma [\ref=lemma2.4] (1), the orbits of K acting on [formula] are R and N. Since τ normalizes K it permutes these orbits. Suppose first that [formula]. Then [formula] is even and R contains an element of [formula] of order 2, which must be - 1. Furthermore by Lemma [\ref=lemma2.4] (1), z  →   - z is in G and has an orbit (u,v) of size 2. By double transitivity some conjugate, λ, of this element lies in q, and, like z  →   - z, fixes 2 letters. Such a λ cannot possibly interchange R and N. So it stabilizes R and N, and since q is a coset of K in H, the same is true of all τ in q. Suppose next that [formula]. Then [formula] is odd, so - 1 cannot be in R. If the lemma fails there is a τ in q with τ(1) in R. Since q is a coset of K in H there is a λ in q with λ(1) = 1. Then [formula] fixes the letters 0, ∞   and 1. By Lemma [\ref=lemma2.4] (2), λ has order 2 and fixes 1. Since λ is a product of disjoint 2-cycles, λ must fix a second letter as well. By double transitivity some conjugate of λ is an order 2 element of K. But [formula] is odd.

Suppose τ∈q. Then there is an n such that whenever z is in [formula] and a is in R, τ(az) = anτ(z). Furthermore [formula] divides n2 - 1.

τ normalizes K. So σ  →  τστ- 1 is an automorphism of K which is of the form σ  →  σn since K is cyclic. Then [formula], giving the first result. Since the square of the automorphism is the identity, [formula] divides n2 - 1.

The case [formula]

In this section [formula]. Our first goal is to show that the n of Lemma [\ref=lemma2.6] can be chosen to be - 1.

X is the set of pairs whose first element is a τ in G, and whose second element is a size 2 orbit {u,v} of τ.

[formula].

The number of size 2 subsets of [formula] is [formula]. We prove the lemma by showing that for each such subset {u,v} there are exactly [formula] elements of G having {u,v} as an orbit. By double transitivity we may assume {u,v}  =  {0,  ∞  }. But τ has {0,  ∞  } as an orbit precisely when τ is in q.

Every element of q has order 2.

Since - 1 is in R, τ:z  →   - z is in K. The letters fixed by τ are 0 and ∞  ; it follows that every element of G commuting with τ stabilizes the set {0,  ∞  } and lies in H. So the centralizer of τ in G has order at most |H| = p - 1, and the number of conjugates of τ is at least [formula]. Call these conjugates τi. Like τ, each τi has [formula] orbits of size 2. So the number of pairs whose first element is some τi and whose second is an orbit of that τi is at least [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lemma3.2] these pairs exhaust X. Suppose now that λ is in q. Then λ has a size 2 orbit, {0,  ∞  }, and so must be some τi, proving the lemma.

The n of Lemma [\ref=lemma2.6] can be taken to be - 1.

Take τ in q, σ in K. By Lemma [\ref=lemma3.3], (τσ)(τσ) = e and τ  =  τ- 1. So τστ- 1  =  σ- 1. Examining the proof of Lemma [\ref=lemma2.6] we get the result.

There is a λ in q and a c in [formula] such that:

λ(z) = z- 1 for z in R.

λ(z) = cz- 1 for z in N.

By Lemma [\ref=lemma2.5] there is a q in R with λ(1) = 1. The result now follows from Corollary [\ref=corollary3.4] and Lemma [\ref=lemma2.6]

Suppose we can show that the c of Corollary [\ref=corollary3.5] is 1. Then, composing λ with the element z  →   - z of K we deduce that [formula] is in G. So to prove the classification theorem for [formula] it's enough to show that c = 1.

When [formula], [formula] is in G.

Let α(z) = 1 - λ(z) with λ as in Corollary [\ref=corollary3.5]. Since - 1 is in R, α is in G. Using the fact that [formula] we see that α- 1(z) = λ(1 - z). Now α(0) =   ∞  , α(  ∞  ) = 1, α(1) = 1 - 1 = 0. So [formula] fixes the letters 0, ∞   and 1. By Lemma [\ref=lemma2.4] (2), α has order 3.

Since [formula], p - 1 is in R. As not all of [formula] are in R there is an x in R with x - 1 in N. The paragraph above shows that α(α(x)) = α- 1(x) = λ(1 - x). We'll use this to show that c = 1. Since [formula], [formula] is in N. Consequently, [formula]. Then [formula] while [formula]. So x - 1 = cx - c, and c = 1.

[formula]

In this section [formula].

There is a unique λ in q with -  λ(1)λ( - 1) = 1. Furthermore λ has order 2.

Fix τ in q. By Lemma [\ref=lemma2.5], - 1 and τ(1) are in N while τ( - 1) is in R. So u =  - τ(1)τ( - 1) is in R. Replacing τ by z  →  vτ(z) with v in R multiplies -  τ(1)τ( - 1) by v2. Since there is a unique v in R with v2 = u- 1 we get the existence and uniqueness of λ. By Lemma [\ref=lemma2.5] there are a and b in R with λ(a) =  - 1, λ( - b) = 1. Taking n as in Lemma [\ref=lemma2.6] we find that anλ(1) =  - 1, bnλ( - 1) = 1. Multiplying we see that (ab)n = 1, so ab = 1. Now -  λ- 1( - 1)λ- 1(1) = ( - a)( - b) = 1, and the uniqueness of λ tells us that λ  =  λ- 1.

Choose n odd as in Lemma [\ref=lemma2.6]. Then there is a λ of order 2 in q and a c in N with

λ(z) = czn  zR

λ(z) = c- 1zn  zN

cn = c

Take λ as in Lemma [\ref=lemma4.1] and set c = λ(1). By Lemma [\ref=lemma2.5], c is in N. Since λ(1) = c, [formula]. Lemma [\ref=lemma2.6] then gives (1) and (2). Since c is in N, λ(c) = c- 1  ·  cn. But as λ has order 2, λ(c) = 1.

Let α(z) = 1 - c- 1λ(z) with c and λ as above. Then α is an element of G of order 3 and α- 1(z) = λ(c(1 - z)).

Since c is in N, - c- 1 is in R, and α is in G. Also α(0) =   ∞  , α(  ∞  ) = 1 and α(1) = 1 - c- 1  ·  c = 0. So [formula] fixes the letters 0, ∞   and 1; by Lemma [\ref=lemma2.4] (2), α has order 3. Finally if μ is the map z  →  λ(c(1 - z)), then μ(α(z)) = λ(λ(z)) = z, and so α- 1  =  μ.

The proof of the classification theorem for [formula] now divides into 2 subcases. In this section we treat the "main case" where the c of Corollary [\ref=corollary4.2] is - 1, showing that [formula] so that [formula] for all z. The "special case", c  ≠   - 1, which leads to conclusion (b) of the classification theorem will be handled in the next section -- it's a bit more technical.

In the main case the only solutions of xn = x in [formula] are 1 and - 1.

Since c =  - 1, c- 1 =  - 1, and λ(x) =  - xn for all x in [formula]. Thus α(x) = 1 - xn. Suppose now that x  ≠  1 is in [formula] with xn = x. Then α(x) = 1 - x and so α(α(x)) = 1 - (1 - x)n. By Lemma [\ref=lemma4.3], α- 1(x) = λ(x - 1) =  - (x - 1)n = (1 - x)n. Since α(α(x)) = α- 1(x), [formula]. Raising to the nth power we find that 1 - x = 2- n. So 1 and 1 - 2- n are the only possible solutions of xn = x in [formula]. Since 1 and - 1 are solutions we're done.

Suppose [formula]. In the main case, λ is the map [formula], and so [formula] is in G.

By Lemma [\ref=lemma4.4] the only solution of xn = x in the cyclic group R of order [formula] is 1. So n - 1 is prime to [formula]. Now [formula] divides (n + 1)(n - 1) by Lemma [\ref=lemma2.6]. So it divides n + 1, and as n is odd, [formula]. Then for z in [formula], [formula]. Furthermore λ(0) =   ∞  , λ(  ∞  ) = 0.

[formula]

We continue with the notation of Section [\ref=section4] but now assume c  ≠   - 1

Let x be a power of - c, and suppose that 1 - x is in N. Then:

α(α(x)) = 1 - c- 2(1 - x)n

α(α(x- 1)) = 1 + x- 1(1 - x)n

α- 1(x) = c2(1 - x)n

α- 1(x- 1) =  - x- 1(1 - x)n

Since cn = c and n is odd, xn = x. Since c is in N, x is in R. Thus α(x) = 1 - c- 1(cxn) = 1 - x, and similarly [formula], which is in R.

Now α(α(x)) = α(1 - x) = 1 - c- 1c- 1(1 - x)n giving (a). And [formula] giving (b). Furthermore α- 1(x) = λ(c(1 - x)). Since c(1 - x) is in R, this is c  ·  c(1 - x)n. Finally [formula].

In the situation of Lemma [\ref=lemma5.1], c2 + c- 2 + 2x- 1 = 0.

α(α(x)) = α- 1(x) by Lemma [\ref=lemma4.3]. (a) and (c) above tell us that (c2 + c- 2)(1 - x)n = 1. Similarly, (b) and (d) tell us that 2x- 1(1 - x)n =  - 1. Adding these identities and noting that (1 - x)n  ≠  0 we get the result.

c3 =  - 1, and either c4 + 3 = 0 or 3c4 + 1 = 0.

There is an x in {c2,c- 2} such that 1 - x is in N. For neither 1 - c2 nor 1 - c- 2 is 0, and if both were in R, their quotient, - c2, would be in R. Similarly there is a y in { - c, - c- 1} such that 1 - y is in N. By Lemma [\ref=lemma5.2], c2 + c- 2 + 2x- 1 and c2 + c- 2 + 2y- 1 are both 0. So x = y, and c3 =  - 1. Also, since c2 + c- 2 + 2x- 1 = 0, either c2 + 3c- 2 or 3c2 + c- 2 is 0.

p = 7. Furthermore either c = 3 and λ = (0  ∞  )(13)(26)(45), or c = 5 and λ = (0  ∞  )(15)(23)(46)

Suppose c4 + 3 = 0. Then, since c3 =  - 1, c = 3. Also 27 =  - 1 in [formula], and so p = 7. We know that cn = c in [formula]. Since c = 3 is a generator of [formula], zn = z for all z in [formula]. In particular if z is in R, λ(z) = czn = 3z, and so λ = (0  ∞  )(13)(26)(45).

Suppose 3c4 + 1 = 0. Then since c3 =  - 1, 3c = 1. So 27c3 = 1, - 27 = 1 in [formula], and once again p = 7. Since 3c = 1, c = 5. Arguing as in the paragraph above we find that λ = (0  ∞  )(15)(23)(46).

Suppose now that c = 3. Then z  →  z + 1 is in G, and since 2 is in R, z  →  2z is also in G. To complete the proof of the classification theorem for c = 3 it suffices to show that the group of permutations of [formula] generated by z  →  z + 1, z  →  2z and λ is of order 168, and has a normal subgroup of order 8 (since G contains this group, and |G| = 168). This can be shown by brute force, but here's a conceptual argument using some of the theory of finite fields.

Let F be the field of 8 elements, ζ be a generator of F*, and U be the group of permutations of F generated by x  →  x + 1, x  →  ζx and x  →  x2. If r is in F*, the conjugate of x  →  x + 1 by x  →  rx is x  →  x + r. It follows that x  →  x + 1 and x  →  ζx generate the "affine group" of F, a group of order 7  ·  8 = 56. Furthermore x  →  x2 is a permutation of F of order 3 normalizing the affine group. We conclude that |U| = 56  ·  3  =  168. The translations x  →  x + a evidently form a normal subgroup of U with 8 elements.

Now identify F with [formula] by mapping 0 to ∞   and ζi to i. Then U may be viewed as a group of permutations of [formula] of order 168. x  →  ζx is the permutation z  →  z + 1, while x  →  x2 is the permutation z  →  2z. Now ζ has degree 3 over [formula], and so ζ3  +  ζ + 1 = 0 or ζ3  +  ζ2 + 1 = 0. Choose ζ so that ζ3  +  ζ + 1 = 0. Then, 1 + 1 = 0, 1 + ζ  =  ζ3, 1 + ζ2  =  ζ6 and 1 + ζ4  =  ζ12  =  ζ5. So x  →  x + 1 is the permutation (0  ∞  )(13)(26)(45) of [formula]. Thus the group generated by z  →  z + 1, z  →  2z and (0  ∞  )(13)(26)(45) identifies with U, and has order 168, and a normal subgroup of order 8. The argument is the same when c = 5, except that we now take ζ with ζ3  +  ζ2 + 1 = 0.

Simplicity results for [formula] and final remarks

The simplicity result of Galois has been generalized in various ways. For example if F is any field with more than 3 elements, finite or infinite, then PSL2(F) is a simple group. I'll give one of the many proofs of this result. Let N be a normal subgroup of SL2(F) containing some non-scalar matrix. If suffices to show that N = SL2(F).

There is an [formula] in N with b  ≠  0.

If not, then since N is normal, every element of N also has c = 0, and so is diagonal. But if [formula] is a non-scalar element of N, the conjugate of [formula] by [formula] isn't diagonal.

Now let P and [formula] be the subgroups [formula] and [formula] of SL2(F). P and [formula] evidently generate SL2(F). Since N is normal, PN = NP, and is the subgroup of SL2(F) generated by P and N.

PN = NP = SL2(F).

Take [formula] in N as in Lemma [\ref=lemma6.1]. Multiplying this matrix on the left by [formula] has the effect of adding r  ·   (row 1) to row 2. So PN contains a matrix [formula]. Multiplying this new matrix on the right by [formula] has the effect of adding s  ·   (column 2) to column 1. So PNP = PN contains a matrix [formula]. This matrix conjugates P into [formula]. So PN contains [formula] as well as P, and is all of SL2(F).

If |F| > 3, N  ⊃  P. So by the remark above, N = SL2(F). Consequently SL2(F) is simple.

Take a  ≠  0, 1 or - 1 in F and let d = a- 1. By Lemma [\ref=lemma6.2], [formula] for some B in the normal subgroup N. Then [formula]. A short calculation shows that as A runs over all the elements of P, (ABA- 1)  ·  B- 1 also runs over all the elements of P. Since each (ABA- 1)  ·  B- 1 is in N, we're done.

In presenting the material of this note to a class one might add the following remarks:

Let F be the field of q elements where q is a prime power. Then PSL2(F) has order [formula] or q3 - q according as q is odd or even. By Proposition [\ref=prop6.3] these groups are simple for q > 3.

If F is the field of q elements it's true that the "only" simple group having the same order as PSL2(F) is PSL2(F) itself. But I think that all proofs of this generalization of Frobenius' result are very difficult. The case q = 4 is trivial -- since [formula], uniqueness when q = 4 follows from the uniqueness when q = 5. The next cases of interest are q = 9 when [formula], and q = 8 when |G| = 83 - 8 = 504. In 1893, F. N. Cole, [\cite=3] (best known to mathematicians for the establishment in his honor of the Cole prize), used intricate arguments to handle these cases. He starts by showing that G is isomorphic to a doubly transitive permutation group on q + 1 letters. But this is no longer an easy consequence of Sylow theory, as it is in the case of prime q.

For n > 2, let SLn(F) be the group of n by n determinant 1 matrices with entries in F, and PSLn(F) be the quotient of SLn(F) by the group of determinant 1 scalar matrices. It can be shown that for all F and for all n > 2 the group PSLn(F) is simple. But now the generalization of Frobenius' theorem has an exception. If F is the field of 4 elements then PSL3(F) and [formula] are non-isomorphic simple groups of order 20,160. (The group of even permutations of 8 letters is also simple of order 20,160, but it is isomorphic to [formula].)
