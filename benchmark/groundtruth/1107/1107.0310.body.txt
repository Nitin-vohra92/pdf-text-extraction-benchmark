On twisted conjugacy classes of type D in sporadic simple groups

Introduction

A fundamental step in the classification of finite-dimensional complex pointed Hopf algebras, in the context of the Lifting method [\cite=MR1659895], is the determination of all finite-dimensional Nichols algebras of braided vector spaces arising from Yetter-Drinfled modules over groups. This problem can be reformulated in other terms: to study finite-dimensional Nichols algebras of braided vector spaces arising from pairs (X,q), where X is a rack and q is a 2-cocycle of X.

A useful strategy to deal with this problem is to discard those pairs (X,q) whose associated Nichols algebra is infinite dimensional. A powerful tool to discard such pairs is the notion of rack of type D [\cite=AMPA]. This notion is based on the theory of Weyl groupoids developed in [\cite=MR2766176] and [\cite=MR2734956]. The importance of racks of type D lies in the following fact: if X is a rack of type D then the Nichols algebra associated to (X,q) is infinite-dimensional for all 2-cocycle q. The property of being of type D is well-behaved with respect to monomorphisms and epimorphisms, see Remark [\ref=rem:tipoD:inj:proy]. On the other hand, it is well-known that a finite rack can be decomposed as an union of indecomposable subracks. Further, every indecomposable rack X admits a surjection X  →  Y, where Y is a simple rack, and the classification of finite simple racks is known, see [\cite=MR1994219] and [\cite=MR682881]. These facts and the ubiquity of racks of type D suggests a powerful approach for the classification problem of finite-dimensional pointed Hopf algebras over non-abelian groups: to classify finite simple racks of type D. This program was described in [\cite=CLA] and successfully applied to the classification of finite-dimensional pointed Hopf algebras over the alternating simple groups [\cite=AMPA] and over many of the sporadic simple groups [\cite=MR2745542]. This paper is a contribution to this program.

Towards the classification of simple racks of type D, we study an important family of simple racks: the twisted conjugacy classes of a sporadic simple group L. Our aim is to classify which of these racks are of type D. For that purpose, we use the fact that these racks can be realized as conjugacy classes of the group of automorphisms of L. The main result of our work is the following theorem.

Let L be one of the simple groups

[formula]

Let O be a conjugacy class of [formula] not contained in L which is not listed in Table [\ref=tab:classes]. Then O is of type D.

Notice that the groups in Theorem [\ref=thm:main] are the only sporadic simple groups with non-trivial outer automorphism group. Theorem [\ref=thm:main] with [\cite=MR2745542] and the lifting method [\cite=MR1659895] imply the following classification result.

Let L be one of the simple groups

[formula]

Then [formula] does not have non-trivial finite-dimensional complex pointed Hopf algebras.

The study of twisted conjugacy classes of sporadic groups is suitable for being attacked case-by-case with the help of computer calculations. The strategy for proving Theorem [\ref=thm:main] is the same as in [\cite=MR2745541] [\cite=MR2745542]. We use the computer algebra system GAP  to perform the computations [\cite=GAP] [\cite=B] [\cite=AtlasRep1.4] [\cite=ATLASwww]. The main scripts and log files of this work can be found in: +http://www.famaf.unc.edu.ar/ fantino/fv.tar.gz+ or +http://mate.dm.uba.ar/ lvendram/fv.tar.gz+.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section [\ref=se:preliminaries] we deal with the basic definitions and the basic techniques for studying Nichols algebras over simple racks. The proof of the main result is given in Section [\ref=se:mainresult]. In the appendix we improve the classification of racks of type D given in [\cite=MR2745542]. With the exception of the Monster group, conjugacy classes of type D in sporadic simple groups are classified, see Remark [\ref=rem:M].

Preliminaries

We refer to [\cite=MR1913436] for generalities about Nichols algebras and to [\cite=MR1994219] for generalities about racks and their cohomologies in the context of Nichols algebras. We follow [\cite=MR827219] for the notations concerning the sporadic simple groups.

A rack is a pair [formula], where X is a non-empty set and [formula] is a map (considered as a binary operation on X) such that the map φx:X  →  X, [formula], is bijective for all x∈X, and [formula] for all x,y,z∈X. A subrack of a rack X is a non-empty subset Y  ⊆  X such that [formula] is also a rack. A rack X is said to be a quandle if [formula] for all x∈X. All the racks considered in this work are indeed quandles.

A rack [formula] is said to be of type D if it contains a decomposable subrack [formula] such that [formula] for some r∈R, s∈S.

Let G be a group. A conjugacy class O of G is of type D if and only if there exist r,s∈O such that (rs)2  ≠  (sr)2 and r and s are not conjugate in the group generated by r and s, see [\cite=MR2745542].

Racks of type D have the following properties:

If Y  ⊆  X is a subrack of type D, then X is of type D.

If Z is a finite rack and p:Z  →  X is an epimorphism, then X of type D implies Z of type D.

The following result is the reason why it is important to study racks of type D. This theorem is based on [\cite=MR2766176] and [\cite=MR2734956].

[\cite=AMPA] Let X be a finite rack of type D. Then the Nichols algebra associated with the pair (X,q) is infinite-dimensional for all 2-cocycles q.

A rack is simple if it has no quotients except itself and the one-element rack. We recall the classification of finite simple racks given in [\cite=MR1994219], see also [\cite=MR682881]. A finite simple rack belongs to one of the following classes:

simple affine racks;

non-trivial conjugacy classes of non-abelian finite simple groups;

non-trivial twisted conjugacy classes of non-abelian finite simple groups;

simple twisted homogeneous racks.

In this paper we study non-trivial twisted conjugacy classes of type D of sporadic simple groups. These racks belong to the class [\eqref=item:tcc] mentioned above.

Twisted conjugacy classes

Let G be a finite group and [formula]. The group G acts on itself by [formula] for all x,y∈G. The orbit of x under this action will be called the u-twisted conjugacy class of x and it will be denoted by OG,ux. It is easy to prove that the orbit OG,ux is a rack with for all y,z∈OG,ux. Notice that [formula] is a conjugacy class in G.

We write [formula] for the group of outer automorphisms of G and [formula] for the canonical surjection.

Assume that [formula]. Let [formula] such that [formula]. Every u-twisted conjugacy class in G is isomorphic (as a rack) to a conjugacy class in the semidirect product [formula]. Indeed,

[formula]

for all x∈G. Therefore the problem of determining u-twisted conjugacy classes of type D in G can be reduced to study conjugacy classes of type D in [formula] and contained in G  ×  {u}.

Conjugacy classes to study

Let L be one of the simple groups

[formula]

It is well-known that [formula] [\cite=MR827219]. Hence, since L is a normal subgroup of [formula], it is possible to compute the list of conjugacy classes of [formula] not contained in L from the character table of [formula], see for example [\cite=MR2270898]. For that purpose, we use the GAP function +ClassPositionsOfDerivedSubgroup+. See the file +classes.log+ for the information concerning the conjugacy classes of [formula] not contained in L.

Strategy

Our aim is to classify twisted conjugacy classes of sporadic simple groups of type D. By Subsection [\ref=subsec:TCC], we need to consider the conjugacy classes in [formula], where L is a sporadic simple group with [formula]. The strategy for studying these conjugacy classes is essentially based on studying conjugacy classes of type D in maximal subgroups of [formula]. See [\cite=MR2745541] for an exposition about the algorithms used.

Useful lemmata

Let G be a non-abelian group and g∈G. We write gG for the conjugacy class of g in G. Let

[formula]

Assume that for all [formula] there exists m∈M such that

[formula]

If gG is of type D, then there exist [formula] and n∈N such that [formula] is of type D.

Since gG is of type D, there exist r,s∈gG such that (rs)2  ≠  (sr)2 and [formula] for H = 〈r,s〉. Since [formula] and [formula], the group H is contained in some maximal subgroup [formula]. Hence [formula] for some n∈N and the claim follows.

Let O be a conjugacy class of G and let H be a subgroup of G such that O contains two conjugacy classes O1, O2 of H. Assume that there exist r∈O1 and s∈O2 such that (rs)2 does not belong to the centralizer of r in G. Then O is of type D.

Notice that (rs)2 = (sr)2 if and only if (rs)2 commutes with r. Then the claim follows.

Let O be a conjugacy class of involutions of G. Then O is of type D if and only if there exist r, s∈O such that the order of rs is even and greater or equal to 6.

Assume that |rs| = n. Then [formula] and the claim follows; see [\cite=MR2745542].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:main]

The claim concerning the automorphism groups of M12 and J2 follows from the application of [\cite=MR2745542]. The claim for the automorphism groups of M22, Suz, HS, He, Fi22 and T follows from the application of [\cite=MR2745542]. There is one log file for each of these groups, see Table [\ref=tab:logs]. The automorphism groups of J3, ON, McL, HN and Fi24' are studied in Subsections [\ref=subsec:ON_McL_J3], [\ref=subsec:HN] and [\ref=subsec:Fi24'], respectively.

The groups [formula], [formula] and [formula]

A conjugacy class O of [formula] is of type D if and only if O∉{}.

A conjugacy class O of [formula] is of type D if and only if O∉{}.

A conjugacy class O of [formula] is of type D if and only if O∉{}.

We first prove (1). We claim that the classes 34A, 34B are not of type D. Let [formula] and let g be a representative of the conjugacy class 34A (the proof for the class 34B is analogous). By [\cite=MR827219], the only maximal subgroup containing elements of order 34 is [formula]. Further, it is easy to see that [formula] satisfies [formula] for some m∈M4 and the class mM4 is not of type D. Hence Lemma [\ref=lem:Breuer_general] applies. See the file +J3.2/34AB.log+ for more information. To prove that the remaining conjugacy classes are of type D, apply [\cite=MR2745542]. See the file J3.2/J3.2.log for more information.

Now we prove (2). We claim that the classes 38A, 38B, 38C of [formula] are not of type D. The only maximal subgroup (up to conjugation) of [formula] containing elements of order 38 is the second maximal subgroup M2. By Lemma [\ref=lem:Breuer_general], it suffices to prove that the classes 38a, 38b, 38c of M2 are not of type D. This follows from a direct GAP computation. See the file +ON.2/38ABC.log+ for more information. To prove that the remaining conjugacy classes are of type D we apply [\cite=MR2745542]. See the file ON.2/ON.2.log for more information.

Now we prove (3). We claim that the classes 22A, 22B of [formula] are not of type D. The only maximal subgroup (up to conjugation) of [formula] containing elements of order 22 is the 8th maximal subgroup M8. By Lemma [\ref=lem:Breuer_general], it suffices to prove that the classes 22a, 22b of M8 are not of type D. This follows from a direct GAP computation. See the file +McL.2/22AB.log+ for more information. To prove that the remaining conjugacy classes are of type D, apply [\cite=MR2745542]. See the file McL.2/McL.2.log for more information.

The group [formula]

All the conjugacy classes in [formula] are of type D.

With GAP  it is possible to obtain the information related to the fusion of the conjugacy classes from the maximal subgroups of [formula] into [formula]. The following table shows the maximal subgroup (and the log file) used and the conjugacy classes of [formula] of type D.

It remains to prove that the class 2C is of type D. By [\cite=AMPA], the class of transpositions in [formula] is the unique class of involutions which is not of type D. But there are three different conjugacy classes of involutions of the maximal subgroup [formula] contained in the class 2C of [formula] and hence the latter is of type D.

The group [formula]

Let O be a conjugacy class of [formula]. Then O is of type D if and only if O∉{}.

As before, we study conjugacy classes in certain maximal subgroups. See the following table for more information:

To prove that the classes 6V, 42D, 84A are of type D we use the maximal subgroup [formula]. Notice that six conjugacy classes of M19 are contained in the class 6V. Further, three of them are of type D. On the other hand, the conjugacy classes of elements of order 42 and 84 in M19 are of type D.

The class 2D of [formula] contains the classes O1  =   and O2  =   of the maximal subgroup [formula]. With GAP we show that there exist r∈O1 and s∈O2 such that (rs)2 has order 13 which does not divide order of the centralizer of the conjugacy class 2A of [formula]. Hence (rs)2 does not commute with r and therefore Lemma [\ref=lem:usefulresult] applies and hence 2D is of type D.

The class 2C is not of type D. Indeed, for all r,s∈, the order of rs is 1, 2 or 3; for this we use the GAP function ClassMultiplicationCoefficient. By Lemma [\ref=prop:tipoD:inv], the claim holds.

For studying the remaining conjugacy classes we use the maximal subgroup [formula]. By [\cite=MR2745542], every conjugacy class of M2 with representative of order distinct from 2 is of type D, see Proposition [\ref=pro:Fi23] in the appendix. Hence the claim follows.

Appendix: the sporadic simple groups

In this appendix we improve some of the results obtained in [\cite=MR2745542]. We remark that it is important to know if a rack X is of type D. By Theorem [\ref=thm:AMPA], if X is of type D, then [formula] for any 2-cocycle q of X, and hence the calculation of the 2-cocycles of X is not needed. Further, as a corollary we obtain that the Nichols algebras associated with any rack Y containing X and for any rack Z having X as a quotient are also infinite-dimensional; see [\cite=CLA] or [\cite=MR2745542]. Indeed, since any finite rack has a projection onto a simple rack, this shows the intrinsic importance of a conjugacy class of being of type D, not just for the specific group where it lives but to the whole classification program of finite-dimensional Nichols algebras associated to racks.

Table [\ref=tab:notD] contains the list of conjugacy classes of sporadic simple groups which are not of type D. The open cases are listed in Remark [\ref=rem:M].

The groups T and Suz

It follows from [\cite=MR2745542] and a direct computer calculation. See the log files for details.

The groups ON, McL, Co3, Ru, HS and J3

We prove (1). By [\cite=MR2745542], it remains to prove that the classes 31A, 31B are not of type D. Let g be a representative for the conjugacy class 31A of G = ON (the proof for the class 31B is analogous). By [\cite=MR827219], the only maximal subgroups (up to conjugacy) containing elements of order 31 are M7 and M8. Further, [formula] and it is easy to see that if M = M7 (or M8) then [formula] for some m∈M. Since the conjugacy class mM is not of type D for all m∈M of order 31, Lemma [\ref=lem:Breuer_general] applies.

To prove (2) the maximal subgroups to use are the Mathieu groups M11 and M22. Then the claim follows from Lemma [\ref=lem:Breuer_general] and [\cite=MR2745542]. To prove (3) the maximal subgroups to use are the Mathieu groups M23. The proofs for (4)-(6) are similar.

The group Fi23

By [\cite=MR2745542], it remains to prove that the classes 23A, 23B are of type D. Let N denote the normal subgroup of order 211 in the maximal subgroup M6≃211.M23 of Fi23, and let x be an element of order 23 in the factor group M6 / N. All preimages of x under the natural epimorphism from M6 to M6 / N have order 23, they are conjugate in M6, and their squares are also conjugate in M6. Take a preimage r of x under the natural epimorphism, choose a nonidentity element n∈N, and set s  =  r2n. Then r and s are conjugate in M6. Moreover, (rs)2 and (sr)2  =  r- 1(rs)2r are different. Indeed, (rs)2  =  (r3n)2  =  r6n', with n': = (r- 3nr3)n, whereas (sr)2  =  r6(r- 1n'r).

The group U generated by r and s is also generated by r and n, and since r acts irreducibly on N, we get that U is a semidirect product of N and 〈r〉. In particular, r and s are not conjugate in U. Hence, the class of r in M6 is of type D.

The groups Fi22 and Co2

The group Fi22

By [\cite=MR2745542], it remains to prove that the classes 22A, 22B are not of type D. Assume that the class 22A of Fi22 is of type D (the proof for the class 22B is analogous). Let r and s be elements of the class 22A such that r and s are not conjugate in the group H = 〈r,s〉. By the fusion of conjugacy classes, H is a proper subgroup of some maximal subgroup M isomorphic to 2.U6(2). Notice that the center of M is [formula]. Using the GAP function PowerMap we get r11 = s11 = z and hence Z(M)  ⊆  H. We claim that the elements rZ(M) and sZ(M) are not conjugate in the quotient H / Z(M). Let p:H  →  H / Z(M) be the canonical projection, and let x∈H such that p(x)p(r)p(x)- 1 = p(s). Then xrx- 1∈{s,sz} and hence xrx- 1 = s since sz has order 11. Now the claim follows from the following lemma.

Let Q = U6(2) and x,y∈Q be two elements of order 11 such that xQ = yQ. Assume that x and y are not conjugate in the subgroup 〈x,y〉. Then [formula].

Let U = 〈x,y〉. Since xQ = yQ and xU  ≠  yU, U is a proper subgroup of a maximal subgroup M and M≃U5(2) or M≃M22. The only maximal subgroup of M which contains elements of order 11 is isomorphic to L2(11) and hence we may assume that U is a proper subgroup of L2(11) because L2(11) has exactly two conjugacy classes of elements of order 11. The only maximal subgroups of L2(11) that contain elements of order 11 are isomorphic to [formula]. These groups have exactly two conjugacy classes of elements of order 11 and hence U must be a proper subgroup of [formula]. From this the claim follows.

The Conway group Co2

By [\cite=MR2745542], it remains to prove that the classes 23A, 23B are not of type D. This follows from the following lemma.

Let Q = Co2 and x,y∈Q be two elements of order 23 such that xQ = yQ. Assume that x and y are not conjugate in the subgroup 〈x,y〉. Then [formula].

Let U = 〈x,y〉. Since xQ = yQ and xU  ≠  yU, U is a proper subgroup of a maximal subgroup M and M≃M23. The only maximal subgroup of M which contains elements of order 23 is isomorphic to [formula]. These groups have exactly two conjugacy classes of elements of order 23 and hence U must be a proper subgroup of [formula]. From this the claim follows.

The groups J4, Ly, Fi24' and B

The Janko group J4

By [\cite=MR2745542] it remains to study the classes 29A, 37A, 37B, 37C, 43A, 43B, 43C. We split the proof into two steps.

This is similar to the proof of Proposition [\ref=pro:ON]. See the files in the folder +J4+ for more information.

The class 37A of J4 contains the classes O1  =   and O2  =   of the maximal subgroup M5≃U3(11).2. With GAP we show that there exist r∈O1 and s∈O2 such that (rs)2 has order 5. The centralizer associated with the conjugacy class 37A of J4 is isomorphic to [formula] and therefore (rs)2 does not commute with r. Hence Lemma [\ref=lem:usefulresult] applies and the claim follows. The proof for the classes 37B, 37C of J4 is analogous, see the file +J4/37ABC.log+ for more information.

The group Ly

By [\cite=MR2745542], it remains to study the classes 33A, 33B, 37A, 37B, 37C, 37C, 67A, 67B, 67C. We split the proof into two steps.

It is similar to the proof of Proposition [\ref=pro:ON]. See the files +Ly/37AB.log+ and +Ly/67ABC.log+ for more information.

It suffices to prove that the classes 33A and 33B of the maximal subgroup 3.McL.2 are of type D. This follows from Lemma [\ref=lem:usefulresult] with the subgroup 3.McL. See the file +Ly/33AB.log+ for more information.

The group Fi24'

By [\cite=MR2745542], it remains to prove that the classes 23A, 23B, 27B, 27C, 33A, 33B, 39C, 39D of Fi24' are of type D and that the classes 29A, 29B are not. For the classes 23A and 23B the result follows from Proposition [\ref=pro:Fi23]. The following six classes can be treated by Lemma [\ref=lem:usefulresult]. The table below contains the information concerning the maximal subgroups to use:

Now we prove that the classes 29A, 29B of Fi24' are not of type D. The unique maximal subgroup (up to conjugacy) that contains elements of order 29 is [formula]. This group has two classes of elements of order 29 and these classes are not of type D. Therefore Lemma [\ref=lem:Breuer_general] applies.

The Conway group Co1

By [\cite=MR2745542], it remains to prove that the classes 23A, 23B are of type D and that the class 3A is not of type D. The proof for the classes 23A and 23B is analogous to the proof of Proposition [\ref=pro:Fi23] using the maximal subgroup M3≃211:M24. The claim for the class 3A follows from a straightforward computer calculation.

The group B

By [\cite=MR2745542], it remains to study the conjugacy classes 2A, 16C, 16D, 32A, 32B, 32C, 32D, 34A, 46A, 46B, 47A, 47B. We split the proof into several steps.

With the GAP function ClassMultiplicationCoefficient we see that for all r,s∈, |rs| is 1, 2, 3 or 4. Then the claim follows from Lemma [\ref=prop:tipoD:inv].

Assume that the class 46A of B is of type D (the proof for the class 46B is analogous). Let r and s be elements of the class 46A such that r and s are not conjugate in the group H = 〈r,s〉. By the fusion of conjugacy classes, H is a proper subgroup of some maximal subgroup M isomorphic to 21 + 22.Co2. Notice that the center of M is [formula]. With the GAP function PowerMap we get r23 = s23 = z and hence Z(M)  ⊆  H. We claim that the elements rZ(M) and sZ(M) are not conjugate in the quotient H / Z(M). Let p:H  →  H / Z(M) be the canonical projection, and let x∈H such that p(x)p(r)p(x)- 1 = p(s). Then xrx- 1∈{s,sz} and hence xrx- 1 = s since sz has order 23. Now the claim follows from Lemma [\ref=lem:Co2].

It is easy to check that the only maximal subgroup of B (up to conjugacy) which contains elements of order 47 is [formula]. (This is the only non-abelian group of order 1081.) This group has two conjugacy classes of elements of order 47 and these classes are not of type D. Then the claim follows from Lemma [\ref=lem:Breuer_general].

The conjugacy classes O1  =   and O2  =   of the first maximal subgroup of B are contained in the class 34A of B. With the GAP functions +ClassMultiplicationCoefficient+ and +PowerMap+ we see that there exist r∈O1 and s∈O2 such that |(rs)2| = 5. Since the centralizer corresponding to the class 34A has order 68, the claim follows from Lemma [\ref=lem:usefulresult].

Let O be the conjugacy class 16C (resp. 16D) of B. The conjugacy classes O1  =   (resp. 16a) and O2  =   (resp. 16f) of the first maximal subgroup of B are contained in the class O. With the GAP functions +ClassMultiplicationCoefficient+ and +PowerMap+ it is easy to see that there exist r∈O1 and s∈O2 such that (rs)2 has order 5. Since the centralizer corresponding to the class O has order 211, the claim follows from Lemma [\ref=lem:usefulresult].

Let O be the conjugacy class 32A of B. We use the GAP function +PossibleClassFusions+ to obtain a list with all the possible fusions from the maximal subgroup M6 into B. As in the previous step, with the GAP functions +ClassMultiplicationCoefficient+ and +PowerMap+ it is easy to show that if O1 and O2 are two different conjugacy classes of M6 contained in the class O of B, then there exist r∈O1 and s∈O2 such that (rs)2 has order 5. Since the centralizer related to the class O has size 27, the claim follows from Lemma [\ref=lem:usefulresult]. The proof for the claim concerning the classes 32B, 32C, 32D is analogous.

The following conjugacy classes of the Monster group M are not known to be of type D: 32A, 32B, 41A, 46A, 46B, 47A, 47B, 59A, 59B, 69A, 69B, 71A, 71B, 87A, 87B, 92A, 92B, 94A, 94B. These are the only open cases related to the problem of classifying conjugacy classes of type D in sporadic simple groups.

It is still unknown whether the Nichols algebras associated with the classes 22A, 22B of Fi22, the classes 2A, 46A, 46B of B, and the classes 32A, 32B, 46A, 46B, 92A, 92B, 94A, 94B of M are finite-dimensional.
