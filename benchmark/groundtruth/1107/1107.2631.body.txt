Notes on the Gabriel-Roiter measure

In his proof of the first Brauer-Thrall conjecture [\cite=Ro], Roiter used an induction scheme which Gabriel formalized in his report on abelian length categories [\cite=G]. The first Brauer-Thrall conjecture asserts that every finite dimensional algebra of bounded representation type is of finite representation type. Ringel noticed that the formalism of Gabriel and Roiter is also useful for studying the representations of algebras having unbounded representation type.

In these notes we present a purely combinatorial definition of the Gabriel-Roiter measure and combine this with an axiomatic characterization; see also [\cite=K]. Given a finite dimensional algebra Λ, the Gabriel-Roiter measure is characterized as a universal morphism [formula] of partially ordered sets. The map is defined on the isomorphism classes of finite dimensional indecomposable Λ-modules and is a suitable refinement of the length function [formula] which sends a module to its composition length. The axiomatic treatment is complemented by a recursive definition of the Gabriel-Roiter measure.

The second part of these notes discusses the Gabriel-Roiter measure for a fixed abelian length category. This is the original setting for Gabriel's work. In particular, Gabriel's main property of the measure is proved. This is used to extend the Gabriel-Roiter measure from indecomposable to arbitrary objects. Our main example is the category of finite dimensional Λ-modules over some finite dimensional algebra Λ. We report on Ringel's work [\cite=R1] [\cite=R2], presenting for instance his refinement of the first Brauer-Thrall conjecture.

These are the notes for a series of four lectures at the "Advanced School and Conference on Representation Theory and Related Topics" in Trieste (ICTP, January 2006). I am grateful to the organizers of this school for exposing me to this beautiful subject. In addition, I wish to express my thanks to the participants for their enthusiasm and to Philipp Fahr for numerous helpful comments.

Chains and length functions

The Gabriel-Roiter measure

There are a number of possible approaches to define the Gabriel-Roiter measure. Fix a partially ordered set [formula] which is equipped with a length function [formula]. We start off by defining the Gabriel-Roiter measure for S as a morphism μ:S  →  P of partially ordered sets which refines the length function λ. Let us stress right away that the values μ(x) for x∈S are not relevant. All we need to know is whether for a pair x,y of elements in S, the relation [formula] holds or not. This is the essence of a measure and we make this precise in the following definition.

Let [formula] be a partially ordered set. A measure μ for S is a relation on S, written [formula], for a pair x,y of elements in S, such that for all x,y,z in S the following holds:

[formula] and [formula] imply [formula].

[formula] or [formula].

[formula] implies [formula].

We write μ(x) = μ(y) if both [formula] and [formula] hold.

A measure μ for S gives rise to an equivalence relation on S as follows: Call two elements x and y equivalent if μ(x) = μ(y). The set S / μ of equivalence classes is totally ordered via μ and the canonical map S  →  S / μ is a morphism of partially ordered sets. Conversely, any morphism φ:S  →  P to a totally ordered set P gives rise to a measure μ for S provided one defines [formula] if [formula] holds.

In this section we present three different approaches defining the Gabriel-Roiter measure for a partially ordered set S and a length function [formula]. To be more precise, we define the Gabriel-Roiter measure as a morphism [formula] of partially ordered sets, where [formula] denotes the lexicographically ordered set of finite sets of natural numbers. We complement this by a recursive and an axiomatic definition. Note that all three concepts are equivalent in the sense that they yield the same measure for S.

The lexicographic order on finite chains

Let [formula] be a partially ordered set. A subset X  ⊆  S is a chain if [formula] or [formula] for each pair x1,x2∈X. For a finite chain X, we denote by min X its minimal and by max X its maximal element, using the convention

[formula]

We write [formula] for the set of all finite chains in S and let

[formula]

On [formula] we consider the lexicographic order which is defined by

[formula]

(1) X  ⊆  Y implies [formula] for [formula].

(2) Suppose that S is totally ordered. Then [formula] is totally ordered. We may think of [formula] as a string of 0s and 1s which is indexed by the elements in S. The usual lexicographic order on such strings coincides with the lexicographic order on [formula].

We need the following properties of the lexicographic order.

Let [formula] and [formula].

[formula].

If X*  <  Y and [formula], then [formula].

(1) Let X' < X and max X' <  max X. We show that [formula]. This is clear if X'  ⊆  X*. Otherwise, we have

[formula]

and therefore [formula].

(2) The assumption X*  <  Y implies by definition

[formula]

We consider two cases. Suppose first that X*  ⊆  Y. If X  ⊆  Y, then [formula]. Otherwise,

[formula]

and therefore X < Y. Now suppose that [formula]. We use again that [formula], exclude the case Y  ⊆  X, and obtain

[formula]

Thus [formula] and the proof is complete.

Length functions

Let [formula] be a partially ordered set. A length function on S is by definition a map

[formula]

such that x < y in S implies λ(x) < λ(y). A length function [formula] induces for each x∈S a map

[formula]

and therefore the following chain length function

[formula]

This chain length function is by definition the Gabriel-Roiter measure for S with respect to λ.

We continue with a list of basic properties (C0) - (C5) of λ*.

A recursive definition

The following property (C0) of the chain length function [formula] can be used to define λ* by induction on the length of the elements in S. We take this as our second definition of the Gabriel-Roiter measure for S with respect to λ. Note that λ*(x) = {λ(x)} if x is a minimal element of S.

Let x∈S.

[formula].

Let X = λ*(x) and note that max X = λ(x). The assertion follows from Lemma [\ref=se:lex] because we have

Basic properties

Let [formula] be a length function and [formula] the induced chain length function. The following basic properties suggest to think of λ* as a refinement of λ.

Let x,y∈S.

[formula] implies [formula].

λ*(x) = λ*(y) implies λ(x) = λ(y).

λ*(x') < λ*(y) for all x' < x and [formula] imply [formula].

Suppose [formula] and let [formula]. Then [formula] and we have [formula] since λ(X)  ⊆  λ(Y). Thus [formula]. If λ*(x) = λ*(y), then

[formula]

To prove (C3), we use (C0) and apply Lemma [\ref=se:lex] with X = λ*(x) and Y = λ*(y). In fact, λ*(x') < λ*(y) for all x' < x implies X* < Y, and [formula] implies [formula]. Thus [formula].

We state some further elementary properties of the map λ*.

Let x,y∈S.

[formula] or [formula].

[formula] is finite for all [formula].

(C4) is clear since [formula] is totally ordered. (C5) follows from the fact that [formula] is finite for all [formula].

The map λ* induces a measure μ for S in the sense of Definition [\ref=se:defgr].

The chain length function λ* induces via

[formula]

a measure for S. Moreover, we have for all x,y in S

[formula]

(C1) and (C4) imply that the map λ* induces a measure μ for S. The characterization for μ(x) = μ(y) follows from (C0).

An axiomatic definition

Let [formula] be a length function. We present an axiomatic characterization of the induced chain length function λ*. Thus we can replace the original definition in terms of chains by three simple conditions which express the fact that λ* refines λ. We take this as our third definition of the Gabriel-Roiter measure for S with respect to λ.

Let [formula] be a length function. Then there exists a map μ:S  →  P into a partially ordered set P satisfying for all x,y∈S the following:

[formula] implies [formula].

μ(x) = μ(y) implies λ(x) = λ(y).

μ(x') < μ(y) for all x' < x and [formula] imply [formula].

Moreover, for any map μ':S  →  P' into a partially ordered set P' satisfying the above conditions, we have for all x,y in S

[formula]

We have seen in ([\ref=se:def]) that λ* satisfies (P1) - (P3). So it remains to show that for any map μ:S  →  P into a partially ordered set P, the conditions (P1) - (P3) uniquely determine the relation [formula] for any pair x,y∈S. In fact, we claim that (P1) - (P3) imply [formula] or [formula]. We proceed by induction on the length of the elements in S. For elements of length n = 1, the assertion is clear. In fact, λ(x) = 1 = λ(y) implies μ(x) = μ(y) by (P3). Now let n > 1 and assume the assertion is true for all elements x∈S of length λ(x) < n. We choose for each x∈S of length [formula] a Gabriel-Roiter filtration, that is, a sequence

[formula]

in S such that x1 is minimal and max x' < xiμ(x') = μ(xi - 1) for all [formula]. Such a filtration exists because the elements μ(x') with x' < x are totally ordered. Now fix x,y∈S of length at most n and let [formula]. We consider r =  max I and put r = 0 if [formula]. There are two possible cases. Suppose first that r = γ(x) or r = γ(y). If r = γ(x), then [formula] by (P1). Now suppose γ(x)  ≠  r  ≠  γ(y). Then we have λ(xr + 1)  ≠  λ(yr + 1) by (P2) and (P3). If λ(xr + 1) > λ(yr + 1), then we obtain μ(xr + 1) < μ(yr + 1), again using (P2) and (P3). Iterating this argument, we get μ(x) = μ(xγ(x)) < μ(yr + 1). From (P1) we get [formula]. Thus [formula] or [formula] and the proof is complete.

Abelian length categories

Additive categories

A category A is additive if every finite family [formula] of objects has a coproduct

[formula]

each set [formula] is an abelian group, and the composition maps

[formula]

are bilinear.

Abelian categories

An additive category A is abelian, if every map φ:A  →  B has a kernel and a cokernel, and if the canonical factorization

[formula]

of φ induces an isomorphism [formula].

Subobjects

Let A be an abelian category. We say that two monomorphisms X1  →  X and X2  →  X are equivalent, if there exists an isomorphism X1  →  X2 making the following diagram commutative. An equivalence class of monomorphisms into X is called a subobject of X. Given subobjects X1  →  X and X2  →  X, we write X1  ⊆  X2 if there is a morphism X1  →  X2 making the above diagram commutative. An object X  ≠  0 is simple if X'  ⊆  X implies X' = 0 or X' = X.

Length categories

Let A be an abelian category. An object X has finite length if it has a finite composition series

[formula]

that is, each Xi / Xi - 1 is simple. In this case the length of a composition series is an invariant of X by the Jordan-Hölder Theorem; it is called the length of X and is denoted by [formula]. For instance, X is simple if and only if [formula]. Note that X has finite length if and only if X is both artinian (i.e. satisfies the descending chain condition on subobjects) and noetherian (i.e. satisfies the ascending chain condition on subobjects).

An abelian category is called a length category if all objects have finite length and the isomorphism classes of objects form a set.

An object X  ≠  0 is called indecomposable if [formula] implies X1 = 0 or X2 = 0. A finite length object admits a finite direct sum decomposition into indecomposable objects having local endomorphism rings. Moreover, such a decomposition is unique up to an isomorphism by the Krull-Remak-Schmidt Theorem.

We denote by [formula] the set of isomorphism classes of indecomposable objects of A.

The Gabriel-Roiter measure

Let A be an abelian length category. We give the definition of the Gabriel-Roiter measure for A which is due to Gabriel [\cite=G] and was inspired by the work of Roiter [\cite=Ro]. Then we discuss some specific properties, including Ringel's results about Gabriel-Roiter inclusions [\cite=R1].

The definition

Let A be an abelian length category. The isomorphism classes of objects of A are partially ordered via the subobject relation

[formula]

We consider the length function [formula] which takes an object X to its composition length [formula]. Then the induced chain length function [formula] is by definition the Gabriel-Roiter measure for A. We will only work with this definition when making explicit computations. Otherwise, we take the induced measure in the sense of Definition [\ref=se:defgr] which is characterized as follows.

Let A be an abelian length category. The Gabriel-Roiter measure induces via

[formula]

a relation on [formula]. This is the unique transitive relation on [formula] satisfying for all objects X,Y the following:

X  ⊆  Y implies [formula].

μ(X) = μ(Y) implies [formula].

μ(X') < μ(Y) for all X'  ⊂  X and [formula] imply [formula].

Here we use the following convention: We write μ(X) = μ(Y) if [formula] and [formula] hold. Morever, we write μ(X) < μ(Y) if [formula] and μ(X)  ≠  μ(Y) hold.

The relation μ(X) = μ(Y) defines an equivalence relation on [formula] and we denote by [formula] the set of equivalence classes. This set is partially ordered via μ. The canonical map [formula] is a morphism of partially ordered sets satisfying the conditions (P1) - (P3) from Theorem [\ref=se:axiom]. Suppose we have another transitive relation, written [formula] for X,Y in [formula], and satisfying (GR1) - (GR3). We obtain a second morphism [formula] of partially ordered sets satisfying the conditions (P1) - (P3), and we deduce from Theorem [\ref=se:axiom] that for all X,Y

Basic properties

Recall from ([\ref=se:def]) that we have established the following property of the Gabriel-Roiter measure.

[formula] or [formula] for X,Y in [formula].

[formula] is finite for all [formula].

Next we discuss further properties of the Gabriel-Roiter measure which depend on the fact that A is a length category.

Gabriel-Roiter filtrations

Let [formula]. We say that X is a Gabriel-Roiter predecessor of Y if X  ⊂  Y and μ(X) =  max Y'  ⊂  Yμ(Y'). Note that each object [formula] which is not simple admits a Gabriel-Roiter predecessor, by (GR4) and (GR5). A Gabriel-Roiter predecessor X of Y is usually not unique, but the value μ(X) is determined by μ(Y).

A sequence

[formula]

in [formula] is called a Gabriel-Roiter filtration of X if X1 is simple and Xi - 1 is a Gabriel-Roiter predecessor of Xi for all [formula]. Clearly, each X admits such a filtration and the values μ(Xi) are uniquely determined by X.

Let [formula].

[formula] is simple if and only if [formula] for all [formula].

Suppose that μ(X) < μ(Y). Then there are Y'  ⊂  Y''  ⊆  Y in [formula] such that Y' is a Gabriel-Roiter predecessor of Y'' with [formula] and [formula].

For (GR6), one uses that each indecomposable object has a simple subobject. To prove (GR7), fix a Gabriel-Roiter filtration [formula] of Y. We have [formula] because Y1 is simple. Using (GR4), there exists some i such that [formula]. Now put Y' = Yi and Y'' = Yi + 1. Comparing the filtration of Y with a Gabriel-Roiter filtration of X (as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=se:axiom]), we find that [formula].

The main property

The following main property of the Gabriel-Roiter measure is crucial for the whole theory.

Let [formula].

Suppose that [formula]. Then [formula] and X is a direct summand of Y if μ(X) =  max μ(Yi).

The proof only uses the properties (GR1) - (GR3) of μ. Fix a monomorphism φ:X  →  Y. We proceed by induction on [formula]. If n = 2, then φ is an isomorphism and the assertion is clear. Now suppose n > 2. We can assume that for each i the ith component φi:X  →  Yi of φ is an epimorphism. Otherwise choose for each i a decomposition [formula] of the image of φi into indecomposables. Then we use (GR1) and have [formula] because [formula] and Yij  ⊆  Yi for all j. Now suppose that each φi is an epimorphism. Thus [formula] for all i. Let X'  ⊂  X be a proper indecomposable subobject. Then [formula] because [formula], and X' is a direct summand if μ(X') =  max μ(Yi). We can exclude the case that μ(X') =  max μ(Yi) because then X' is a proper direct summand of X, which is impossible. Now we apply (GR3) and obtain [formula]. Finally, suppose that μ(X) =  max μ(Yi) = μ(Yk) for some k. We claim that we can choose k such that φk is an epimorphism. Otherwise, replace all Yi with μ(X) = μ(Yi) by the image [formula] of φi as before. We obtain [formula] since Ykj  ⊂  Yk for all j, using (GR1) and (GR2). This is a contradiction. Thus φk is an epimorphism and in fact an isomorphism because [formula] by (GR2). In particular, X is a direct summand of [formula]. This completes the proof.

Let [formula] and suppose that X  ⊂  Y with μ(X) =  max Y'  ⊂  Yμ(Y'). If X  ⊆  U  ⊂  Y in A, then X is a direct summand of U.

Let [formula] be a decomposition into indecomposables. Now apply (GR8). We obtain [formula] and our assumption on X  ⊂  Y implies that X is a direct summand of U.

The Gabriel-Roiter measure [formula] for A can be extended to a measure defined for all objects in A, not only the indecomposable ones. Let [formula] be an object written as a direct sum of indecomposable objects. Then we define

[formula]

The relation

[formula]

induces a measure for the set of isomorphism classes of A.

We need to verify (M1) - (M3) from Definition [\ref=se:defgr]. The first two conditions are automatic and the third is an immediate consequence of (GR8).

Gabriel-Roiter inclusions

Let [formula]. An inclusion X  ⊆  Y is called Gabriel-Roiter inclusion if μ(X) =  max Y'  ⊂  Yμ(Y'). Thus we have a Gabriel-Roiter inclusion X  ⊆  Y if and only if X is a Gabriel-Roiter predecessor of Y.

Let [formula] and suppose that X  ⊂  Y is a Gabriel-Roiter inclusion. Then Y / X is an indecomposable object.

Let Z = Y / X and assume that [formula] with Z''  ≠  0. We obtain the following commutative diagram with exact rows and columns.

[formula]

We have X  ⊆  Y'  ⊂  Y and therefore the monomorphism X  →  Y' splits by Corollary [\ref=se:main]. Thus the inclusion Z'  →  Z factors through Y  →  Z via a split monomorphism Z'  →  Y. We conclude that Z' = 0 since Y is indecomposable.

The argument is borrowed from Auslander and Reiten. They show that the cokernel of an irreducible monomorphism between indecomposable objects is indecomposable.

Let Y be an indecomposable object in A which is not simple. Then there exists a short exact sequence 0  →  X  →  Y  →  Z  →  0 in A such that X and Z are indecomposable.

Take X  ⊂  Y with μ(X) =  max Y'  ⊂  Yμ(Y').

Finiteness results

In this section, Ringel's refinement of the first Brauer-Thrall conjecture is presented [\cite=R1]. More precisely, we prove a structural result about the partial order of the values of the Gabriel-Roiter measure.

Covariant finiteness

A subcategory C of A is called covariantly finite if every object X∈A admits a left C-approximation, that is, a map X  →  Y with Y∈C such that the induced map [formula] is surjective for all C∈C. We have also the dual notion: a subcategory C is contravariantly finite if every object in A admits a right C-approximation.

Let C be a subcategory of A which is closed under taking direct sums and subobjects. Then C is a covariantly finite subcategory of A.

Fix X∈A. Let X'  ⊆  X be minimal among the kernels of all maps X  →  Y with Y∈C. Then the canonical map X  →  X / X' is a left C-approximation.

The proof shows that the inclusion functor C  →  A admits a left adjoint F:A  →  C which takes X∈A to X / X'. Note that the adjunction map X  →  FX is a left C-approximation.

Let M be any set of values μ(X). Then we define the subcategory

[formula]

Let M be a set of values μ(X) which is closed under predecessors, that is, [formula] and μ(X2)∈M implies μ(X1)∈M. Then A(M) is a covariantly finite subcategory of A.

The subcategory A(M) is closed under taking subobjects by (GR8).

Almost split morphisms

A map φ:X  →  Y in A is called left almost split if φ is not a split monomorphism and every map X  →  Y' in A which is not a split monomorphism factors through φ. Dually, a map ψ:Y  →  Z is called right almost split if ψ is not a split epimorphism and every map Y'  →  Z which is not a split epimorphism factors through ψ. For example, if [formula] for some artin algebra Λ, then every indecomposable object X∈A admits a left almost split map starting at X and a right almost split map ending at X; see [\cite=ARS].

Immediate successors

Let [formula]. An immediate successor of μ(X) is by definition a minimal element in

[formula]

Let [formula] and suppose that X is a Gabriel-Roiter predecessor of Y. If X  →  X̄ is a left almost split map in A, then Y is a factor object of X̄.

The monomorphism X  →  Y factors through X  →  X̄ via a map φ:X̄  →  Y. Let U be the image of φ. Applying Corollary [\ref=se:main], we find that U = Y.

Let [formula] and suppose there exists [formula] such that each [formula] with [formula] and [formula] admits a left almost split map V  →   with [formula]. Then there exists an immediate successor of μ(X) provided that μ(X) is not maximal.

Let μ(X) < μ(Y). We apply (GR7) and find Y'  ⊂  Y''  ⊆  Y in [formula] such that Y' is a Gabriel-Roiter predecessor of Y'' with [formula] and [formula]. The preceding lemma implies [formula], and (GR5) implies that the number of values μ(Y'') is finite. Thus there exists a minimal element among those μ(Y'').

Let Λ be an artin algebra and [formula]. Then there exists an immediate successor of μ(X) provided that μ(X) is not maximal.

Use that there exists [formula] having the following property: for each indecomposable [formula], there exists a left almost split map V  →   satisfying [formula]. In fact, one takes [formula], where p denotes the maximal length of an indecomposable projective Λ-module and q denotes the maximal length of an indecomposable injective Λ-module; see [\cite=ARS].

A finiteness criterion

We present a criterion for a subcategory C of A such that the number of indecomposable objects in C is finite. This is based on the following classical lemma.

Let [formula]. A composition [formula] of non-invertible maps between indecomposable objects of length at most n is zero.

See [\cite=ARS].

Let A be a length category with left almost split maps and only finitely many isomorphism classes of simple objects. Suppose that C is a subcategory such that

C is covariantly finite, and

there exists [formula] such that [formula] for all indecomposable X∈C.

Then there are only finitely many isomorphism classes of indecomposable objects in C.

We claim that we can construct all indecomposable objects X∈C in at most 2n steps from the finitely many simple objects in A as follows. Choose a non-zero map S  →  X from a simple object S and factor this map through the left C-approximation S  →  S'. Take an indecomposable direct summand X0 of S' such that the component S  →  X0  →  X of the composition S  →  S'  →  X is non-zero. Stop if X0  →  X is an isomorphism. Otherwise take a left almost split map X0  →  Y0 and a left C-approximation Y0  →  Z0. The map X0  →  X factors through the composition X0  →  Y0  →  Z0 and we choose an indecomposable direct summand X1 of Z0 such that the component X0  →  Y0  →  X1  →  X is non-zero. Again, we stop if X1  →  X is an isomorphism. Otherwise, we continue as before and obtain in step r a sequence of non-invertible maps

[formula]

such that the composition is non-zero. The Harada-Sai lemma implies that r < 2n because [formula] for all i by our assumption. Thus X is isomorphic to Xi for some i < 2n, and we obtain X in at most 2n steps, having in each step only finitely many choices by taking an indecomposable direct summand. We conclude that C has only a finite number of indecomposable objects.

This classical argument provides a quick proof of the first Brauer-Thrall conjecture; it is due to Auslander and Yamagata.

The initial segment

Let A be a length category such that [formula] is infinite. Suppose also that A has only finitely many isomorphism classes of simple objects and that every indecomposable object admits a left almost split map. Then there exist infinitely many values [formula] of the Gabriel-Roiter measure for A having the following properties.

If μ(X)  ≠  μ(Xi) for all i, then μ(Xi) < μ(X) for all i.

The set [formula] is finite for all i.

We construct the values μ(Xi) by induction as follows. Take for X1 any simple object. Observe that μ(X1) is minimal among all μ(X) by (GR6) and that only finitely many [formula] satisfy μ(X) = μ(X1) because A has only finitely many simple objects. Now suppose that [formula] have been constructed, satisfying the conditions (1) and (2) for all [formula]. We can apply Proposition [\ref=se:suc] and find an immediate successor μ(Xn + 1) of μ(Xn). It remains to show that the set [formula] is finite. To this end consider [formula]. We know from Proposition [\ref=se:cov] that A(M) is a covariantly finite subcategory. Clearly, [formula] is bounded by [formula] for all indecomposable X∈A(M) by (GR2). We conclude from Proposition [\ref=se:fin] that the number of indecomposables in A(M) is finite. Thus [formula] is finite and the proof is complete.

Let A be a length category satisfying the above conditions. Then for every [formula] there exists an indecomposable object X∈A with [formula].

Use that for fixed [formula], there are only finitely many values μ(X) with [formula], by (GR5).

The terminal segment

Let A be a length category such that [formula] is infinite. Suppose also that A has a cogenerator (i.e. an object Q such that each object in A admits a monomorphism into a direct sum of copies of Q) and that every indecomposable object admits a right almost split map. Then there exist infinitely many values [formula] of the Gabriel-Roiter measure for A having the following properties.

If μ(X)  ≠  μ(Xi) for all i, then μ(Xi) > μ(X) for all i.

The set [formula] is finite for all i.

The proof is based on the following lemma.

Let A be a length category and let X∈A. Denote by AX the subcategory formed by all objects in A having no indecomposable direct summand which is isomorphic to a direct summand of X. If every indecomposable direct summand of X admits a right almost split map, then AX is contravariantly finite.

Let [formula] be a decomposition into indecomposables. It is sufficient to construct a right AX-approximation for each indecomposable object Z∈A. We take the identity map if Z∈AX. Otherwise, Z is isomorphic to Xi0 for some i0 and we proceed as follows. Let φi0:X̄i0  →  Xi0 be a right almost split map and choose a decomposition

[formula]

such that Yi0∈AX and [formula] for all i1. Note that each map V  →  Xi0 with V∈AX factors through φi0. Also, each component Xi0i1  →  Xi0 of φi0 is non-invertible. Now compose φi0 with [formula] to obtain a map

[formula]

Again, each map V  →  Xi0 with V∈AX factors through this new map, and each component Xi0i1i2  →  Xi0i1 is non-invertible. We continue this procedure, compose this map with

[formula]

and so on. Now let n = 2m where [formula]. Then the Harada-Sai lemma implies that any composition

[formula]

is zero. Thus the induced map

[formula]

is a right AX-approximation of Xi0.

We construct the values μ(Xi) by induction as follows. Let [formula] and suppose that [formula] have been constructed, satisfying the conditions (1) and (2) for all [formula]. Denote by P the direct sum of all [formula] with [formula], and let P = 0 if n = 0. Choose a right AP-approximation P'  →  Q and take for Xn + 1 any indecomposable direct summand X of P' such that μ(X) is maximal. Observe that every indecomposable object X∈AP is cogenerated by Q and therefore by P'. Thus (GR8) implies that μ(X) is bounded by μ(Xn + 1). Moreover, if μ(X) = μ(Xn + 1), then X is isomorphic to a direct summand of P'. Thus [formula] is finite and the proof is complete.

Let Λ be an artin algebra of infinite representation type. Then [formula] satisfies the assumptions of Theorems [\ref=se:init] and [\ref=se:term]. Let us summarize the structure of the partial order on the values of the Gabriel-Roiter measure as follows. We have

[formula]

where the notation [formula] for a poset S means [formula] and x1 < x2 for all x1∈S1, x2∈S2.

The Kronecker algebra

Let [formula] be the Kronecker algebra over an algebraically closed field k. We consider the abelian length category which is formed by all finite dimensional Λ-modules. A complete list of indecomposable objects is given by the preprojectives Pn, the regulars Rn(α,β), and the preinjectives Qn; see [\cite=ARS]. More precisely,

[formula]

and we obtain the following Hasse diagram.

[formula]

The set of indecomposables is ordered via the Gabriel-Roiter measure as follows:

Let A be an abelian length category. We propose a definition of the Gabriel-Roiter measure for the bounded derived category [formula]. The derived Gabriel-Roiter measure extends the Gabriel-Roiter measure for the underlying abelian category A.

The definition

The bounded derived category [formula] of A is by definition the full subcategory of the derived category [formula] which is formed by all complexes X such that HnX = 0 for almost all n. Note that each object of [formula] admits a finite direct sum decomposition into indecomposable objects having local endomorphism rings. Moreover, such a decomposition is unique up to an isomorphism. We denote by [formula] the set of isomorphism classes of indecomposable objects of [formula].

We consider the functor

[formula]

and the isomorphism classes of objects of [formula] are partially ordered via

[formula]

We have the length function

[formula]

and the induced chain length function [formula] is by definition the Gabriel-Roiter measure for [formula].

Derived versus abelian Gabriel-Roiter measure

The Gabriel-Roiter measure for [formula] extends the Gabriel-Roiter measure for A. More precisely, the canonical functor [formula] sending an object of A to the corresponding complex concentrated in degree zero induces an inclusion [formula] of partially ordered sets, which makes the following diagram commutative.

[formula]

Use the fact that the diagram

[formula]

is commutative and that [formula] is closed under predeccessors in [formula].

An alternative definition

For an alternative definition of the Gabriel-Roiter measure for [formula], consider the lexicographic order on

[formula]

[formula]

Take instead of [formula] the length function

[formula]

and instead of [formula] the induced chain length function

[formula]

We illustrate the difference between both definitions by taking a hereditary length category A. Recall that A is hereditary if [formula]. Then each indecomposable object of [formula] is isomorphic to a complex concentrated in a single degree. Identifying objects having the same Gabriel-Roiter measure, we obtain

[formula]
