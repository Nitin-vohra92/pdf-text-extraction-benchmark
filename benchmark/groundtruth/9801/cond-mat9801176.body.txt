A Conjecture on random bipartite matching

The problem of random bipartite matching (or assignment) is interesting both from the point of view of optimisation theory and of statistical mechanics [\cite=PS] [\cite=mp1] [\cite=mp2] [\cite=qua].

Each instance of the problem is characterised by a N cross N matrix d; sometimes d(i,k) represents the distance between i and k. We are interested to compute the length of the optimal bipartite matching defined as:

[formula]

where the minimum is done over all the N! permutations (Π) of N elements and Π(i) denote the results of the action of the permutation Π on i.

If the matrix d has a given probability distribution, we can define the average of L(d) over this probability distribution. The problem of computing this average can be studied using the technique of statistical mechanics.

A well studied case is when the elements of d are statistically independent one from the others. Here we can use replica theory [\cite=mpv] [\cite=parisibook2] in the mean field approximation. When the probability distribution of each element of d is flat in the interval
