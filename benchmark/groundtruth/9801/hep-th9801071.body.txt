ABSTRACT

We calculate vacuum energy for twisted SUSY D-brane on toroidal background with constant magnetic or constant electric field. Its behaviour for toroidal D-brane (p=2) in constant electric field shows the presence of stable minimum for twisted versions of the theory. That indicates such background maybe reasonable groundstate.

In attempts to understand the D-brane theory [\cite=2] [\cite=3] [\cite=4] study of its vacuum polarization may be quite important because of different reasons. In particular, calculation of the vacuum energy (or the effective potential) (as in the case of p-brane [\cite=8]) and study their properties may define reasonable background as a candidate for groundstate. The investigation of such groundstate can clarify if theory contains tachyons in the spectrum or not.

Toroidal background is one of the simplest candidates for groundstate in the theory of extended objects. It is well-known fact that toroidal background in the theory of D = 11 supermembrane [\cite=DI] is supersymmetric one and the vacuum energy is zero on such background. However, if antiperiodic boundary conditions are chosen for fermions (like non-zero temperature) the supersymmetry is usually broken and the vacuum energy is not zero. Such twist assignments (antiperiodic boundary conditions for all or part of fermions) are consistent with classical SUSY transformations so it could be that not all supersymmetries of the model are broken (compare with [\cite=14]).

Recently the effective potential for SUSY D-brane in the constant electromagnetic field has been found [\cite=KN] (for the case of bosonic D-brane see [\cite=NO]). However, only periodic boundary conditions have been discussed in Ref. [\cite=KN].

The purpose of present letter is to extend results of the paper [\cite=KN] to the case of twisted fermion fields. In particular, we may have such situation for the effective potential at non-zero temperature if identify one of dimensions of torus with temperature.

The supersymmetric D-brane can be given by the following Dirac-Born-Infeld-type action (see Refs. [\cite=Ab] [\cite=So] [\cite=Ag])

[formula]

where ζi's are coordinates on the D-brane world sheet ([formula]), Fij is the electromagnetic field strength on the D-brane world sheet:

[formula]

and ZM are the superspace coordinates of D-brane

[formula]

([formula], [formula]). θ is a Majorana-Weyl (16 independent components) spinor in case of heterotic string, a Majorana spinor in case of type IIA superstring and are two kinds of Majorana-Weyl (totally 32 components) spinors in case of type IIB superstring. In Eq. (1) φ(X) is a dilaton field and SWZ is Wess-Zumino like term containing anti-symmetric tensor fields. Note that this term will not be important for our purposes so we dont discuss it below.

We consider the case when the action is given by

[formula]

Gμν is the metric of the space-time, Bμν is the anti-symmetric tensor and

[formula]

where Γμ = eμaγa (eμa is the vielbein field and γa's denote γ matrices in 10 dimensions). For simplicity, we assume Gμν and Bμν are constants. The action ([\ref=DBIS]) is invariant under the global super-Poincaré transformation

[formula]

The correspondent transformations for vector and tensor fields are not written explicitly. The system also has local reparametrization invariance with respect to ζ and κ-symmetry.

The reparametrization invariance is fixed by choosing the gauge condition

[formula]

A fermionic symmetry is fixed by

[formula]

where matrix Γ squares to 1 and has a vanishing trace; (1 + Γ) is a projector which makes a 32-dimensional parameter of κ-supersymmetry effectively only 16-dimensional. Note that in the above gauge, there appear no Faddeev-Popov ghosts.

We want to address the stability of D-brane when Fij (or Bij) has nontrivial vacuum expectation value and study the effective potential, which is defined by

[formula]

Here VA is the gauge volume for the gauge field Ai and

[formula]

The integration in Eq. ([\ref=EP]) with respect to θ should be understand to be integrated over the θα space restricted by ([\ref=kappagf]). We now also impose boundary conditions corresponding to the toroidal D-brane. The twist assignments to X,θ,ε must be consistent with the supersymmetry transformations (6). For instance the case when spinor fields are twisted is admissible as well as the case when the fields are untwisted. Note that the number of non-isomorphic linear real bundles over the toroidal space Tp + 1 (the number of spinor fields) is the number of elements in 1st cohomology group [formula]. Therefore the number of topologically non-equivalent spinor configurations is 2p + 1 and we have

[formula]

where [formula] for type IIA,  IIB superstring and α = 8 for heterotic string. Below we only consider the Type IIA and IIB superstrings with

[formula]

and assume that anti-symmetric tensor fields in SWZ vanish. We also divide the anti-symmetric part Fij in Ĝij into the sum of the classical part Fcij and the quantum fluctuation Fqij:

[formula]

In the following we write R2iδij  +  Fcij as Ĝij and Fqij as Fij.

Quadratic expansion of the action has been done in Ref. [\cite=KN]

[formula]

where

[formula]

is defined with the inverse matrix (Ĝ- 1)ij of Ĝij. The contribution to the one-loop effective potential from the [formula] and the gauge fields was calculated in [\cite=NO]. The contribution from fermions was found in [\cite=KN]:

[formula]

Then with the following matrices

[formula]

one gets

[formula]

where gα,  gβ = 0 or 1 / 2,  depending on the spinor field type choosen in Tp + 1, [formula].

Let us consider explicit examples for the choice of electromagnetic background. First we consider the membrane (p = 2) with the magnetic background

[formula]

and assume

[formula]

Then we obtain

[formula]

and

[formula]

The total one-loop effective potential (taking into account the bosonic contribution [\cite=NO]) has the following form

[formula]

where the last term gives the contribution from fermions. Here we have used zeta-function regularization (see ref. [\cite=E] for a review). We define the 2-dimensional Epstein zeta-function associated with the quadratic form [formula] and with s > 1 by the formula

[formula]

[formula]

where gi and hi  (i = 1,2) are some real numbers, the prime means omitting the term with (n1,n2) = ( - g1, - g2) if all the gi are integers. For s < 1 the Epstein function is understood to be the analytic continuation of the right-hand side of Eq. (28). Defined in such a way, the Epstein function obeys the explicit form (see Ref. [\cite=zuck] for detail)

[formula]

[formula]

where the function ζ(s) is the Riemann zeta function, η(s) = (1 - 21 - s)ζ(s) and β(s) is the analytical continuation of the series sum [formula] convergent at s > 0. Therefore [formula], while [formula] for [formula] or for [formula].

Rescaling

[formula]

we obtain

[formula]

Therefore if g1  =  g2 = 0 then VT = h3 / 2(R4 + 1)1 / 2, but if (g1,g2)  ≠  (0,0) one gets

[formula]

For R  →  0 we have VT = h3 / 2  +  O(R), while for R  →    ∞  ,  VT = h3 / 2R2  +  O(R- 1). It can be shown that the one-loop effective potential has stable minimums iff (g1,g2)  ≠  (0,0).

Let us find now the one-loop effective potential of the membrane in the constant electric background where

[formula]

Then we find

[formula]

[formula]

Now the total one-loop effective potential (taking into account the bosonic contribution found in Ref. [\cite=NO]) is given by

[formula]

The function [formula] is defined by the relation for s > 1

[formula]

where [formula], a is a real number, i.e. a2 > 0. Use the Mellin representation

[formula]

and the Poisson resummation formula yields the following expression

[formula]

[formula]

In Eq. (39) Kν(z) are the modified Bessel functions and G(an2) = a(n2  +  g2) + g1. In the case [formula] the Z0(s;a) is given by the Chowla-Selberg formula [\cite=chow49-35-317]

[formula]

[formula]

where [formula], sum over the s-powers of the divisors of n. Finally for s =  - 1 we have

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

In Eq. (41) the functional equation (analytic continuation)

[formula]

has been used. A simple calculation along the above line gives

[formula]

and [formula], while [formula].

When R  →  0,    (a  →   - 1) and (g1,g2)  ≠  (0,0) the one-loop effective potential behaves as

[formula]

where [formula] for g1  =  g2 and [formula] for g1  -  g2  =    ±  1 / 2. On the other hand, when R  →    ∞      (a  →  0) we have

[formula]

Thus using Eqs. (45) and (46) one can show that there are minimums of the function VT. This should be compared with the effective potential of the bosonic D-membrane in the electric background, which is unstable. Thus supersymmetric D-brane in constant electric field becomes the stable one unlike the case of the bosonic D-brane. That indicates such background maybe reasonable candidate for groundstate. Then detailed quantization of D-brane on such background deserves further study.
