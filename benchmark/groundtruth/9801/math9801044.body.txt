Whitney's index formula in higher dimensions and Laplace integrals

Introduction

Let f  =  (f1,f2):I  R  →  I  R2 be a long curve, i.e. a smooth immersion such that f1(x)  =  x and f2(x)  =  0 for x  ≤   - 1 and x  ≥  1. By the famous theorem of Whitney (see [\cite=Index]) long curves are classified by a single integral invariant, an index (rotation number). Informally saying, index is a number of full rotations made by the tangent vector Df(x)  =  (f1'(x),f2'(x))  ≠  0 as x goes from -    ∞   to +    ∞   (or, equally, from - 1 to 1). The explicit formula for the index is as follows:

[formula]

The integral in the right-hand side of ([\ref=Eq:Index1]) is [formula] where

[formula]

is the closed form in [formula] forming a basis in its de Rham cohomologies [formula].

Suppose now that f is generic. By Thom's transversality theorem (see [\cite=Singul]) f has only a finite number of self-intersection points. All these points are simple (i.e. only two branches of the curve meet) and transversal. A point a∈I  R2 of simple transversal self-intersection can be equipped with a sign σ(a)  =    ±  1 by the following rule. Let f(x(1))  =  f(x(2))  =  a and x(1)  <  x(2). By transversality, the tangent vectors Df(x(1)) and Df(x(2)) are not parallel, and therefore form a basis in I  R2. Choose an orientation of I  R2 and take

[formula]

Then there holds Whitney's index formula (see [\cite=Index]):

[formula]

where the sum is taken over all the self-intersection points of the curve f.

The paper is devoted to the generalization of ([\ref=Eq:Index1])-([\ref=Eq:SumSign1]) to the case of smooth immersions f:I  Rn  →  I  R2n such that f(x)  =  (x,0) for [formula] large. In Section [\ref=Sec:SelfInt] we define an index and prove a "sum of signs" formula for generic immersions. Section [\ref=Sec:Integral] contains a proof of an explicit integral formula for the index (for n even); the proof makes use of asymptotic expansions of certain Laplace integrals. The formula obtained looks like [formula] where ω is an n-form on the Stiefel variety V(n,2n) and Df:I  Rn  →  V(n,2n) is a differential. It is proved in Section [\ref=Sec:Stiefel] that ω is a generator of the de Rham cohomology group Hn(V(n,2n)).

Index and self-intersection points

Recall that the map [formula] is called an immersion if for any x∈I  Rn the (n  ×  2n)-matrix

[formula]

has the rank n (i.e., belongs to the Stiefel variety V(n,2n)). We will always suppose that the immersion f is "fixed at infinity", i.e. f(x)  =  (x,0) as soon as x lies outside the unit cube of I  Rn. Generic immersions I  Rn  →  I  R2n fixed at infinity have only a finite number of self-intersection points, all of which are simple and transversal.

The homotopy classes of immersions I  Rn  →  I  R2n form an abelian group [formula]. Definition of the multiplication resembles that of a homotopy group: take

One of the formulations of the famous Smale classification theorem (see [\cite=ClassImm]) is

The mapping [formula] is a group isomorphism.

So to classify immersions we need to know the group πn(V(n,2n)). The answer is the following well-known lemma (see, for example, [\cite=FuchsFom], page 173):

[formula]

Thus, smooth immersions f:I  Rn  →  I  R2n are classified by a single invariant, an index I(f) which is either an integer (for n  =  1 and n even) or an element of Z   Z2 (for odd n  ≥  3). The case n  =  1 is covered by the results of Whitney, and in what follows we will always assume that n  >  1.

For n even, a point a∈I  R2n of simple transversal self-intersection of immersion f can be equipped with a sign σ(a)  =    ±  1 by the following rule: if f(x(1))  =  f(x(2))  =  a (and x(1)  ≠  x(2)), then take

[formula]

(the right-hand side contains a determinant of the matrix 2n  ×  2n). Geometrically this means that we choose positively oriented bases in the tangent spaces to the image of f at points x(1) and x(2). Since f is immersion, these 2n vectors form a basis in I  R2n, and σ(a) is taken ±  1 depending on the orientation of this basis (orientation of I  R2n is fixed beforehand). Since n is supposed to be even, the result will not depend on the order in which the preimages x(1),x(2)∈f- 1(a) are taken (for n = 1 we supposed that x(1)  <  x(2), but there is no way to choose this order for n  >  1).

[formula]

where the sum is taken over all the self-intersection points of f, and the summation is performed in Z   Z for n even and in Z   Z2 for odd n  ≥  3.

Let ft be a generic continuous family of smooth immersions I  Rn  →  I  R2n fixed at infinity. By Thom's transversality theorem the set of self-intersection points of ft is changes continuously with t, except for a finite number of points [formula] where two "catastrophes" may occur: either two self-intersection points merge and disappear, or, conversely, emerge. It can be easily observed that for n even the pair of points to emerge or to perish always have opposite signs. It follows from this that (for any n) the right-hand side of ([\ref=Eq:SumSignN]) depends only on the homotopic class of the immersion f. Thus, this right-hand side defines a mapping S from [formula] to Z   Z or Z   Z2, depending on parity of n.

Definition of multiplication in [formula] shows that S is a homomorphism. By Theorem [\ref=Th:ClassImm], to prove equation ([\ref=Eq:SumSignN]) it is enough to show that S is an isomorphism, i.e. that its image is the whole Z   Z or Z   Z2. In other words it should be proved that [formula], i.e. that there exists an immersion f(n):I  Rn  →  I  R2n with only one self-intersection point.

Such immersion is easily constructed by induction on n. For n  =  1 take a smooth plane curve f(1) such that f(1)( - 1 / 2)  =  f(1)(1 / 2), and there are no more self-intersection points. Suppose now that immersion f(n) is already constructed, and the self-intersection is [formula]. Let φ(t) be a smooth function such that φ( - 1 / 2)  ≠  φ(1 / 2) and φ(t)  =  0 for [formula]. Then it can be easily seen that the formula

[formula]

defines an immersion I  Rn + 1  →  I  R2n + 2 whose sole self-intersection is [formula], so that induction step is made.

An integral formula for the index

Let us derive an explicit integral formula for the index I(f). For the reasons explained in the previous Section we restrict ourselves to the case of n even (an element of Z   Z2 hardly can appear as an integral).

Start with a technical result. Let f:I  Rn  →  I  R2n be an arbitrary smooth map (even not immersion) fixed at infinity. Consider a mapping Af:I  R2n  →  I  R2n given by the formula Af(x,y)  =  f(x)  -  f(y) (x,y∈I  Rn) and recall that degree of a smooth mapping g:M  →  N (M and N being oriented manifolds of the same dimension) is defined as Here y∈N is a generic point, and [formula] is taken 1 or - 1 depending on whether the mapping Df:TxM  →  TyN preserves or inverts orientation. The right-hand side of this equation can be called multiplicity of g at y.

The degree of the mapping Af is zero.

Prove first that the degree of Af is defined. To do this denote E  ⊂  I  R2n the subspace of vectors [formula]. Since n  >  1, any two points [formula] can be connected with the path zt that does not intersect E. Notice now that since f is fixed at infinity, for every compact set [formula] its full preimage A- 1f(B) is compact, and therefore multiplicity of Af at zt does not depend on t. So, multiplicity is the same for all generic points, and [formula] is defined. But then [formula] because the image of Af is not the whole I  R2n (for example, if z∈I  R2n is large enough and normal to the subspace E then certainly [formula]).

Consider not Af as a change of variable in I  R2n and apply it to the 2n-form [formula]. Using Lemma [\ref=Lm:DegZero], obtain the following result:

[formula]

Our idea is now to find the asymptotics of the integral ([\ref=Eq:IntIsZero]) for λ  →    +    ∞   using the general results about asymptotics of Laplace integrals. Then we consider the principal term of the asymptotics and equalize it to zero.

To formulate the result introduce first some notations. Let φ  =  (φji)∈V(n,2n) (i.e. [formula]). For an arbitrary set of integers [formula] such that [formula] denote

[formula]

Denote also

[formula]

(by the general theorem about Gram determinant, det U equals the sum of squares of the n-th order minors of the matrix φ, and is therefore positive).

Let n be even, f:I  Rn  →  I  R2n be a smooth immersion fixed at infinity, and Df:I  Rn  →  V(n,2n) be its differential. Then the index of f is given by the formula

[formula]

where the 2n-form ω at the point φ  =  (φji)∈V(n,2n) is

[formula]

(Σn means the symmetric group).

To prove Theorem [\ref=Th:IntIndex] we will need the following asymptotical expansion found in [\cite=Asymp] (Statement 4.1 at page 125):

Let a,S be smooth real-valued functions at I  Rk, S achieving its minimum at the origin (and only at the origin). Let the Hessian [formula] be nondegenerate. Denote L the 2nd order differential operator [formula], and [formula]. Then for λ  →    +    ∞   there is an aymptotic expansion up to the O(λ-    ∞):

[formula]

The left-hand side J(f) of ([\ref=Eq:IntIsZero]) is exactly the Laplace integral mentioned in Lemma [\ref=Lm:Expand] with k  =  2n, u  =  (x,y), [formula], and [formula]. Minimum point of S is not unique but the general localization principle for Laplace integrals (see [\cite=Asymp]) tells that one should consider expansions ([\ref=Eq:Expand]) for all such points and sum them up (points other then local minima make O(λ-    ∞) contributions).

Local minima of S(x,y) are:

Self-intersection points of f: f(x)  =  f(y) and x  ≠  y.

Diagonal points: x  =  y.

Other ("sporadic") minima.

At sporadic minima s  =  S(x,y)  >  0. So expansion ([\ref=Eq:Expand]) contains the term exp ( - λs) and therefore is already O(λ-    ∞). Thus, sporadic minima will be neglected.

To self-intersection points (x,y) Lemma [\ref=Lm:Expand] can be applied directly. The principal term here is p  =  0. Denote [formula] the vector [formula] and observe that [formula]. By the general theorem about Gram determinant we have [formula], and the principal term is It follows now from Theorem [\ref=Th:SumSign] that total contribution to the principal term of asymptotics from all the self-intersection points is equal to

[formula]

The factor 2 is present because every self-intersection point appears twice as a minimum of S: the first time as (x,y) and the second time as (y,x).

Consider now the contribution from the diagonal. The minimum of S here is not isolated (and therefore degenerate) but it is easy to see that we should consider asymptotic expansion of the integral over y (with x fixed) and then integrate it over x (necessary theorems about uniformity of asymptotic expansion ([\ref=Eq:Expand]) are contained in [\cite=Asymp]). If x is fixed then y  =  x is a nondegenerate minimum of S, and [formula] where [formula]. By the general theorem about Gram determinant

[formula]

The right-hand side contains the sum of squares of all the n-th order minors of the (2n  ×  n)-matrix [formula].

First we are to find the leading term of expansion. Let v(t),w(t) be smooth functions of one variable. Then it is easy to see that

[formula]

for some integers [formula] (which we need not specify). Apply this formula with v  =  a, w  =  R to expansion ([\ref=Eq:Expand]). Here [formula] and [formula], and the degree of the operator L is 2 (so, Lp contains differentiations of the order 2p). Thus, the p-th term of expansion will contain λu - p - n / 2 where

[formula]

Thus 2p  ≥  n  +  3u, and therefore u - p  ≤   - n / 2. So, the leading term is

[formula]

where g(x) is given by ([\ref=Eq:Def_g]).

Denote [formula]. Then, by definition, and This yields:

[formula]

Here Σn means the symmetric group. The subscript j in determinants runs from 1 to 2n, the subscript k, from 1 to n. Thus, total contribution to the principal term of the asymptotics of J(f) from the diagonal y  =  x equals:

[formula]

But it follows from ([\ref=Eq:IntIsZero]) that [formula]. Thus, combining ([\ref=Eq:ContSInt]) and ([\ref=Eq:ContrDiag]), one has

[formula]

Notice now that for any [formula]

[formula]

Now to get ([\ref=Eq:IndexForm]) expand the determinant in ([\ref=Eq:IndThrInt]) in the first n rows.

An explicit formula for the generator of Hn(V(n,2n))

Take up again Lemma [\ref=Lm:HomStie]. By Gurevich theorem (see e.g. [\cite=FuchsFom]) for n even, HnDR(V(n,2n))  =  I  R is the first nontrivial cohomology group of the Stiefel variety V(n,2n). Let ω0 be a closed n-form at V(n,2n) whose integral over the fundamental cycle (generator of the Hn(V(n,2n),Z   Z)) is 1. Then the homotopic class ∈πn(V(n,2n))  =  Z   Z of the spheroid γ:Sn  →  V(n,2n) equals to [formula]. Now Theorems [\ref=Th:IntIndex] and [\ref=Th:ClassImm] suggest that ω  =  ω0, i.e.,

The cohomology class of the n-form ω given by ([\ref=Eq:FormStie]) forms the basis in HnDR(V(n,2n)). The value of this class on the generator of the Hn(V(n,2n),Z   Z) is 1.

The main step in the proof of Theorem [\ref=Th:OmeBasis] is the following

The form ω is closed.

By Theorem [\ref=Th:IntIndex] the equality

[formula]

holds for any holonomic γ  =  (γij):I  Rn  →  V(n,2n). The holonomity means that γ  =  Df for some immersion f:I  Rn  →  I  R2n fixed at infinity, or, equivalently, that the equations

[formula]

and

[formula]

(for x lying outside the unit cube of I  Rn) hold.

Consider a one-parameter family of mappings γt  =  (γij  +  tδij). The definition of Lie derivative L and the Cartan formula LX  =  ιXd  +  dιX imply that

[formula]

Taking in ([\ref=Eq:Deriv]) t  =  0 and γ  =  γ0  =  Df, and taking ([\ref=Eq:IntOmOm0])-([\ref=Eq:InfGamma]) into consideration, one obtains the equality

[formula]

for every f and every δ  =  (δij(x)) such that

[formula]

and

[formula]

for x lying outside the unit cube of I  Rn.

Take some immersion f:I  Rn  →  I  R2n fixed at infinity, and denote Pij(x) the function such that [formula]. Denote also Qijk a function such that [formula]. Qijk is defined uniquely up to addition of a function Cijk independent of xk. If ([\ref=Eq:DeltHol]) and ([\ref=Eq:DeltInf]) are fulfilled then

[formula]

Since ([\ref=Eq:FunctDelt]) is zero for δ satisfying ([\ref=Eq:DeltHol]) and ([\ref=Eq:DeltInf]), the standard Riesz lemma implies that

[formula]

In particular, it holds for j = k, i.e. or

[formula]

Equation ([\ref=Eq:DiffDfj]) and boundary condition ([\ref=Eq:InfGamma]) imply that (Df)*ι∂  /  ∂φijdω  =  0. Since f is arbitrary, it is possible only if ι∂  /  ∂φijdω  =  0 for any i,j, which means that dω  =  0. Lemma is proved.

Since ω is closed and the cohomologies Hn(V(n,2n)) are one-dimensional, there exist λ∈I  R and the (n - 1)-form ν such that ω  =  λω0  +  dν. Then for any γ:I  Rn  →  V(n,2n) fixed at infinity one obtains

[formula]

Comparing ([\ref=Eq:IntOmLOm0]) with ([\ref=Eq:IntOmOm0]) one obtains λ  =  1. Theorem is proved.
