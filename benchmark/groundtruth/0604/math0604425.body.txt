On the number of rational squares at fixed distance from a fifth power

Introduction

Let A  ≠  0 be a rational number. We are interested in the number of rational solutions (x,y) to the equation y2  =  x5  +  A. In more geometric terms, this amounts to counting the (affine) rational points on the curve CA given by the (affine) equation

[formula]

In this note, we take up ideas from [\cite=Stoll] and apply them to this family of genus 2 curves. In the following, CA will denote a smooth projective model of the curve in question. With respect to rational points, this means that there is one additional rational point "at infinity", which we will denote ∞   in what follows.

Let JA be the Jacobian of CA, and denote by rA the Mordell-Weil rank of [formula]. Since CA and CB are isomorphic when the quotient A / B is a tenth power, we can (and will) assume that A is an integer, not divisible by the tenth power of any prime. Let nA be half the number of "non-trivial" points in [formula], i.e., finite points with non-vanishing x and y coordinates. Then [formula], where dA  =  1, 2, 3, or 4 if A is neither a square nor a fifth power, a fifth power but A  ≠  1, a square but A  ≠  1, or A  =  1, respectively. Since r1  =  0, we have dA  ≤  3 if rA  ≥  1.

The numbers we are interested in are nA and [formula]. The result we will prove is as follows.

Let A be a tenth power free integer, and assume that rA  =  1. Then nA  ≤  2 and therefore [formula]. Furthermore, [formula] only when A  =  182.

Let S be the set of tenth power free integers. If we define

[formula]

then the theorem says that N(1)  =  2, B(1)  =  7.

For r  =  0, we obtain N(0)  =  1, B(0)  =  4. This is because the torsion points on CA are known to be (see for example [\cite=PoonenTors])

[formula]

where ζ is a primitive fifth root of unity. The only nontrivial points in this list are of the form given last. But there is only one value of A, namely A  =  28   ·   55, such that this leads to a pair of rational points on CA. We have rA  =  0 and nA  =  1 in this case (but dA  =  1, so [formula]). For all other A such that rA  =  0, we must have nA  =  0, hence [formula]. The maxmimum is attained for the unique A with dA  =  4, namely A  =  1.

Since the method of proof can be applied only when rA  <  g(CA)  =  2, we cannot obtain exact values for higher ranks. However, we have found the following examples, thus obtaining lower bounds.

[formula]

For these examples, the rank rA was determined by first computing an upper bound using 2-descent as described in [\cite=StollDesc] and then exhibiting sufficiently many independent points in the Mordell-Weil group (which are here provided by the rational points on CA).

The method

We will apply Chabauty's method with a twist, as explained in [\cite=Stoll]. In that paper, we were only considering sufficiently large primes. In our situation, we obtain the following result in this way. In the following, vp denotes the normalized p-adic valuation.

Suppose that rA  =  1. Then nA  ≤  1 in the following cases.

vp(A)  =  5 for some prime p  ≥  7.

vp(A)∈{2,4,6,8} for some prime p  ≥  11.

vp(A)∈{1,3,7,9} for some prime p  ≥  17.

We use the main result of [\cite=Stoll], applied to CA with Γ taken to be (1) μ2 acting on y, (2) μ5 acting on x, and (3) μ2  ×  μ5 acting on (y,x), respectively. Note that in each case, CA is a Γ-twist of CA / pvp(A), which has good reduction at p.

In principle, this reduces the cases that we have to check to a finite number. However, the number of cases is large (a priori, there are 103   ·   9   ·   52  =  225  000 curves; we can expect close to half of them to have rA  =  1), and dealing with them one by one would require a very large amount of computation.

We therefore want to use the method at the small primes, too. This will reduce the cases we have to look at to a manageable number.

The basic setup is as follows. If rA  =  1, then there is a differential

[formula]

(with [formula]) killing the Mordell-Weil group in the sense that

[formula]

Note that the integral is linear both in [formula] and in ω, and vanishes when P is a torsion point in [formula]. We embed CA into JA using the point at infinity as a base point and from now on consider CA as a subvariety of JA. Then [formula] is contained in the set of zeros of λω on [formula]. Therefore the number of nontrivial rational points is bounded by the number of nontrivial zeros of λω (note that λω vanishes at the trivial points, since they are mapped to torsion points of JA).

Before we use the twisting trick of [\cite=Stoll], let us prove a result that will help reduce the number of cases later, using the standard Chabauty technique.

Assume that rA  =  1. If [formula], then we have nA  ≤  1. If [formula], then we have nA  ≤  2.

If [formula], then we have [formula] If [formula], then [formula]

Let [formula] be the reduction of (a suitable multiple of) ω mod 3. We find that v(3,0)  =  0, v(3,1)  =  1, v(3,2)  =  0 in the notation of [\cite=Stoll]. By Prop. 6.3 in [\cite=Stoll], the number of zeros of λω on the residue class of [formula] is at most 1  +  n  +  v(3,n), where n  =  vP(). This implies that we can only get nontrivial points in residue classes on which [formula] vanishes, or in nontrivial residue classes. Furthermore, the number of zeros of λω in the residue class of P can be at most 3, since vP()  ≤  2. The two nontrivial classes ( - 1,  ±  1) that occur for [formula] contain the torsion point [formula]. Since this point is rational only when A  =  28   ·   55, and rA  =  0 in this case, it is still true that we can get nontrivial rational points in these classes only when [formula] vanishes there.

Let us consider the various classes in turn. If P  =    ∞   or P  =  (  ±  1,0) and [formula] vanishes at P (then of second order), there can only be one pair of nontrivial rational points in this residue class, and hence nA  ≤  1, since no other class contributes to nA.

In the other cases, [formula] can only vanish to first order. One of the a priori up to three zeros on the residue class will be a torsion point, which is trivial or not rational. Therefore there can be at most two pairs of nontrivial rational points, and nA  ≤  2. It remains to show that in fact, nA  ≤  1 if [formula]. In this case, we have P  =  (0,  ±  1) with vP()  =  1, so   =  x  dx / 2y.

We write A  =  a2 with [formula] such that (0,a) reduces to the point we are considering. t  =  x is a uniformizer, and we have, taking ω  =  (3α  +  x)dx / 2y:

[formula]

We see that there is only one non-trivial root in [formula] (satisfying [formula]); therefore nA  ≤  1.

Looking at the small primes

Our first goal is to show that nA  ≤  2 for all A such that rA  =  1, by a detailed study of the 3-adic situation. We have covered the case v3(A)  =  0 in Lemma [\ref=Lem30] already, so here we will consider the cases 1  ≤  v3(A)  ≤  9.

We keep the notations introduced above. However, we now suppose that A is divisible by p (we will mostly take p  =  3 below), so that A  =  pν  a with some 1  ≤  ν  ≤  9 and [formula]. Let π  =  p1 / 10 and set x  =  π2ν  X, y  =  π5ν  Y; then over [formula], CA is isomorphic to

[formula]

and on Ca,

[formula]

Since [formula] is totally ramified, the residue class field of [formula] is [formula]. The points in [formula] are mapped to one of the following types of points in [formula]. ([formula] denotes the image of [formula].)

∞  .

( - ,0) if ν  =  5 and a  =  b5 for some [formula].

(0,) if ν is even and a  =  b2 for some [formula].

This holds when p  ≠  2,5. It still holds when p  =  2 or 5 and [formula].

We want to bound the number of non-trivial points in [formula] mapping to each of these points mod π. If p is large enough, this bound is given by the order of vanishing of the differential [formula] at the point in question (assuming ω is scaled such that it is integral and reduces to something non-zero mod π). This is how the results in Prop. [\ref=Prop] are obtained. In order to get bounds when p is small, we need to take a closer look at the logarithm

[formula]

(recall that the logarithm vanishes on torsion points) where T is a uniformizer at the trivial point P(0) in the residue class under consideration, and P(T) is the point corresponding to the value T∈πOπ of the uniformizer. This logarithm λω can be expanded into a power series in T, and the number of its zeros in πOπ can be bounded above by considering the valuations of the coefficients (and, in some cases, the factoring of polynomials over [formula]). In fact, we are only interested in zeros that arise from points in [formula], which restricts the possibilities further.

We discuss the various possible image points in turn.

The residue class of ∞

The corresponding points on CA have [formula], and we have [formula]. T is a uniformiser in ∞   on Ca. We have the equations

[formula]

so

[formula]

Since 3, 11 and 13 are the only primes occurring in denominators of relevant coefficients (the later terms do not matter, as is easily seen), we see that for all other primes p, the following holds.

If [formula], then there is only one rational point (namely ∞  ) in this residue class. Otherwise, if [formula], there may be three, and if [formula] with ξ  ≠  0, there is one point if - 3αβ is a non-square mod p, and at most three points if - 3αβ is a square mod p.

We will not discuss p  =  11 and p  =  13 here. If p  =  3, there always are at most three points, but the condition is shifted. We write ω  =  (3α'  +  β  x)  dx / 2y with [formula]; then there can be three points if '  ≠  0 and -  ' is a square. We obtain the following result, strengthening part (3) of Prop. [\ref=Prop].

Suppose rA  =  1. If vp(A)∈{1,3,7,9} for some p  ≠  11,13, then nA  ≤  1.

Note that if vp(A)∈{1,3,7,9}, ∞   is the only point in [formula] that is hit by [formula]. By the preceding discussion, there is at most one pair of nontrivial rational points in this residue class.

The residue class of ( - b,0)

we now assume ν  =  5 (and p  ≠  5) and a  =  b5, so we have y2  =  x5  +  p5b5. The points in the residue class we are considering have [formula] and [formula]. We choose T  =  Y as the uniformiser on Ca; then [formula] with [formula]. Expanding everything in terms of T, we get

[formula]

The interesting case for us here is p  =  3. We again write α  =  3α' and assume that [formula], not both in [formula]; then up to scaling, we have mod 3

[formula]

If '  =  0, there will be only one solution. If α'  =  1, we will have three solutions if a(1  -  bβ) is a square, and one solution if it is a non-square. In any case, there is at most one pair of nontrivial rational points in this residue class. For all other primes p  ≠  5, we get at most one pair of nontrivial rational points in this class as well, but only if vp(α)  >  vp(β). We therefore obtain, taking into account the discussion of ∞   above, the following strengthening of Prop. [\ref=Prop], part (1).

Suppose rA  =  1. If v3(A)  =  5, then nA  ≤  2. If vp(A)  =  5 for a prime p∉{3,5}, then nA  ≤  1.

The residue class of (0,b)

Let ν  =  2n and set [formula]. We must exclude p  =  2 here. We have ρ  =  5μ  -  ν  =  3,1,4,2 for n  =  1,2,3,4, respectively. The points in the residue class have x  =  pμ  t with [formula] and [formula]. We choose T  =  X  =  π2ρ  t as a uniformiser on Ca. This gives

[formula]

If p∉{2,3,7}, then there is at most one nontrivial solution, and we obtain at most one pair of nontrivial rational points mapping to (0,  ±  ). Together with the discussion of ∞  , this proves the following. The only new case is p  =  5, since p  ≥  11 is already taken care of by Prop. [\ref=Prop], part (2).

Assume rA  =  1 and vp(A)∈{2,4,6,8} for some p∉{2,3,7}. Then nA  ≤  1.

We have a contribution of at most 1 to nA from ∞   and a contribution of at most 1 from (0,  ±  ). However, we get a contribution from ∞   only when vp(β)  ≥  vp(α), but then there is no contribution from (0,  ±  ), as can be seen from the expansion of λω above.

We have to consider the cases p  =  3 and p  =  7 separately. When p  =  3, we have, with ω  =  (3α'  +  βx)dx / 2y as before:

[formula]

If ρ  >  1, only the first two terms matter. We get extra solutions only if v3(α')  ≥  v3(β)  +  μ  -  1. If ρ  =  1 (and therefore μ  =  1, ν  =  4), we have to look at solutions in [formula] of

[formula]

(Recall that a is a square, so ā  =  1.) If '  =  0, there is one extra solution. Otherwise, we can take α'  =  1, and then we have no extra solutions if   =   - 1, we have one extra solution if   =  0, and we have potentially two extra solutions if   =  1. Considering this together with the result at infinity, we get the following.

Suppose rA  =  1. If v3(A)∈{6,8}, then nA  ≤  1. If v3(A)∈{2,4}, then nA  ≤  2.

The following table summarizes the possible contributions to nA from the residue classes of ∞   and of (0,  ±  b), depending on the reduction mod 3 of [formula].

[formula]

We see that for ν  =  6 or 8, nA  ≤  1, whereas for ν  =  2 or 4, nA  ≤  2.

Now we consider p  =  7. This leads to

[formula]

The t5 term is irrelevant. If   ≠  0, then there are no extra solutions. In general, we need v7(α)  ≥  v7(β)  +  μ for there to be extra solutions. In this case, if ρ  >  1, then there is just one extra solution. If ρ  =  1, i.e., ν  =  4 and α  =  7α', then (taking β  =  1 without loss of generality), we must consider the roots in [formula] of

[formula]

There can be more than one extra solution; in this case there are up to four extra solutions. In any case, together with the result at infinity, we get the following.

Suppose rA  =  1. If v7(A)∈{2,6,8}, then nA  ≤  1.

Putting it Together

Collecting the information obtained so far, we see that Lemmas [\ref=Lem30], [\ref=Lem31], [\ref=Lem35] and [\ref=Lem32] cover all cases. This proves the first part of Theorem [\ref=Thm].

Now, if A is such that rA  =  1 and [formula], we need to have dA  =  3 and nA  =  2. So A has to be a square. Furthermore, by Lemma [\ref=Lem5], the prime factors of A are contained in {2,3,7}, by Lemma [\ref=Lem7], v7(A)∈{0,4}, and by Lemmas [\ref=Lem30] and [\ref=Lem32], v3(A)∈{2,4}. This leaves 5   ·   2   ·   2  =  20 values of A to check. We can reduce the number of cases further by noting that if [formula], all points in [formula] lift to torsion points in [formula], and therefore by standard Chabauty, nA  ≤  1. This reduces the list to the following eight values:

[formula]

The table below summarizes the data for these curves.

[formula]

The ranks rA have been found by computing an upper bound as described in [\cite=StollDesc] and exhibiting sufficiently many independent points in [formula] (which are mostly provided by points in [formula]). The values for nA in the cases when rA  =  1 have been verified by a standard Chabauty computation (at p  =  29 for A  =  28   ·   32, at p  =  29 and p  =  59 for A  =  26  ·  32: there are four extra residue classes left after the computation with p  =  29, which can then be excluded by looking mod 59 -- see [\cite=PSS] for an explanation of the method).

This shows that A  =  182  =  22   ·   34 is the only value such that rA  =  1 and CA has 7 rational points. The last statement of Theorem [\ref=Thm] is therefore also verified.

It would be interesting to find out if there are more values of A such that rA  =  1 and nA  =  2 (which then will be non-squares).

In any case, it is easy to see that there is no A such that rA  =  1 and [formula]. This would imply that nA  =  2 and A is a fifth power, so by Lemma [\ref=Lem35], A is one of 1,35,55,35   ·   55. But all these values satisfy [formula], so nA  ≤  1 if rA  =  1 (which is the case for A  =  35 and 35   ·   55).
