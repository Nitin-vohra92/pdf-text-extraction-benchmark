Abstract

In this paper we present the necessary and sufficient conditions of separability for multipartite pure states. These conditions are very simple, and they don't require Schmidt decomposition or tracing out operations. We also give a necessary condition for a local unitary equivalence class for a bipartite system in terms of the determinant of the matrix of amplitudes and explore a variance as a measure of entanglement for multipartite pure states.

Keywords: Entanglement, measure of entanglement, quantum computing, separability.

Introduction:

Notation: M+ is the complex conjugate of transpose of M.

Let |ψ〉 and |φ〉 be two pure states of a composite system AB possessed by both Alice and Bob, where system A (B) is called Alice's (Bob's) system. By Nielsen's notation |ψ〉 ~   |φ〉 if and only if |ψ〉  and |φ〉 are locally unitarily equivalent [\cite=Nielsen99]. Let ρAψ and ρAφ be the states of Alice's system. It is known that |ψ〉 ~   |φ〉  if and only if ρAψ and ρAφ have the same spectrum of eigenvalues [\cite=Nielsen99] [\cite=Peres]. A pure state is separable if and only if it can be written as a tensor product of states of different subsystems. It is also known that a state |ψ〉 of a bipartite system is separable if and only if it has Schmidt number 1 [\cite=Nielsen00]. Clearly it is essential to do Schmidt decomposition to find the eigenvalues of ρAψ and ρAφ. To obtain a Schmidt decomposition of a pure state |ψ〉, we need to compute (1) the density operator ρABψ; (2) the reduced density operator ρAψ for system A; (3) the eigenvalues of ρAψ. However it is hard to compute roots of a characteristic polynomial of high degree.

Peres presented a necessary and sufficient condition for the occurrence of Schmidt decomposition for a tripartite pure state [\cite=Peres95] and showed that the positivity of the partial transpose of a density matrix is a necessary condition for separability [\cite=Peres96]. Thapliyal showed that a multipartite pure state is Schmidt decomposable if and only if the density matrices obtained by tracing out any party are separable [\cite=Thapliyal99]. In [\cite=Grassl] the local invariants of quantum-bit systems were investigated. In [\cite=Sudbery00][\cite=Sudbery01] the local symmetry properties and local invariants of pure three-qubit states were discussed, respectively. In [\cite=Acin] the classification of three-qubit states was given. Bennett reported measures of multipartite pure-state entanglement in [\cite=Bennett00]. Meyer and Wallach [\cite=Meyer] proposed a measure of n - qubit pure-state entanglement. Nielsen used the majorization of the eigenvalues of the reduced density operators of a composite system AB to describe the equivalence class under LOCC transformations.

For a multi (n)-  partite system, in this paper we illustrate the reduced density operators obtained by tracing out the ith subsystem ρ12...(i - 1)(i + 1)...n = tri(ρ12...n) = MiM+i, where i = 1,2,...,n and Mi are the dn - 1  ×  d matrices, of which every entry is an amplitude of the state in question. For a bipartite system AB, the reduced density operator ρAψ (ρBψ)= MM+, where M is the matrix of the amplitudes. Hence det (ρAψ) = | det (M)|2. However, for a multi (n)-  partite system, Mi are not square. In section 2, we present a necessary and sufficient condition for separability for a bipartite system in terms of the determinants of all the 2  ×  2 submatrices of the matrix of the amplitudes. Section 3 contains three versions of the necessary and sufficient separability criterion for a n - qubit system. Section 4 is devoted to study the separability of multipartite pure states, and two versions of the necessary and sufficient separability criterion are proposed. Section 5 gives a simple necessary criterion for |ψ〉 ~   |φ〉 for a bipartite system. Section 6 suggests an intuitive measure of multipartite pure-state entanglement.

The separability for a bipartite system

Let |ψ〉 be a pure state of a composite system AB possessed by both Alice and Bob. In this section we give a simple and intuitive criterion for the separability. Let |i〉 (|j〉) be the orthonormal basis for system A (B). Then we can write [formula], where [formula]. Let M = (aij)n  ×  n be the matrix of the amplitudes of |ψ〉. Then the criterion for the separability is as follows.

|ψ〉 is separable if and only if the determinants of all the 2  ×  2 submatrices of M are zero.

This criterion for the separability avoids Schmidt decomposition. To compute the determinants, it needs n2(n - 1)2 / 2 multiplication operations and n2(n - 1)2 / 4 minus operations.

Proof. Suppose that systems A and B have the same dimension n. By definition, |ψ〉 is separable if and only if we can write [formula], where [formula] and [formula]. By tensor product [formula]. It means that |ψ〉 is separable if and only if xiyj = aij, i,j = 0,1,...,(n - 1)......(1). Let [formula]a&a[formula]a&a[formula] be any 2  ×  2 submatrix of M. It is easy to check det (m) = ailajk - aikajl = xiylxjyk - xiykxjyl = 0. Therefore if |ψ〉 is separable then the determinants of all the 2  ×  2 submatrices of M are zero.

Conversely, suppose that the determinants of all the 2  ×  2 submatrices of M are zero. We can write M in the block form, [formula]A[formula]A[formula] [formula]A[formula], where Ai is the ith row and Bi is the ith column of M, respectively, i = 0,1,...,(n - 1). Let [formula] and [formula], i,j = 0,1,...,(n - 1), respectively. Under the supposition we can show that the above xi in (2) and yj in (3) satisfy (1). Let us consider the case in which all the aij are real. It is not hard to extend the result to the case in which all the aij are complex. We only show [formula] and omit the others. From (2) and (3), [formula] [formula]. In the last but one step we use the equality [formula], which holds since [formula]a&a[formula]a&a[formula] is a 2  ×  2 submatrix of M. This completes the proof.

Corollary

If |ψ〉 is separable then det (M) = 0.

The separability for a n - qubit system

Let |ψ〉 be a pure state of a n - qubit system. Then we can write [formula]. Let the density operator ρ12...n = |ψ〉〈ψ| and ρ12...(i - 1)(i + 1)...n be the reduced density operator obtained by tracing out the ith qubit. Then ρ12...(i - 1)(i + 1)...n = tri(ρ12...n) = MiM+i, where i = 1,2,...,n and Mi are 2(n - 1)  ×  2 matrices of the form [formula] in which b1,b2,...,bn∈{0,1}.

For example, let |ψ〉 be a state of a 3-qubit system. Then |ψ〉 can be written as [formula]. M3 is a 4  ×  2 matrix [formula]a&a[formula]a&a[formula]a&a[formula]a&a[formula]. Each entry of M3 is an amplitude of |ψ〉.

There are three versions of the separability.

Version 1. |ψ〉 is separable if and only if the determinants of all the 2  ×  2 submatrices of M1,M2,.... and Mn are zero.

The proof of version 1 is similar to the one for a bipartite system in section 2.

Version 2. |ψ〉 is separable if and only if aiaj = akal, where i + j = k + l and [formula] where 0  ≤  i,j,k,l  ≤  2n - 1 are n - bit strings and [formula] indicates addition modulo 2.

For example, 2, 7, 5 and 4 can be written in binary numbers as 010,111,101 and 100, respectively. It is well known 010 + 111(modulo 2)= 101, 101 +   100 = 001(modulo 2). Therefore 2 + 7  ≠  5 + 4(modulo 2) though 2 + 7 = 5 + 4 = 9.

Using this condition it is easy to verify that states [formula] |21〉 + ... + |2n - 1〉 and [formula] for a n - qubit system [\cite=Dur] are entangled.

Let i1i2...in, j1j2...jn, k1k2...kn and l1l2...ln be n - bit strings of i,j,k and l, respectively. Then version 3 is phrased below.

Version 3. |ψ〉 is separable if and only if aiaj = akal, where {it,jt}  =  {kt,lt}, t = 1,2,...,n.

The following lemma 1 shows that versions 2 and 3 are equivalent to each other.

Lemma 1. i + j = k + l and [formula] if and only if {it,jt}  =  {kt,lt}, t = 1,2,...,n.

The proof of lemma 1 is put in appendix A.

We argue version 3 next.

Assume that [formula]. By tensor product x(1)i1x(2)i2....x(n)in = ai1i2...in, where it = 0,1, t = 1,2,...,n. Then aiaj = x(1)i1x(1)j1x(2)i2x(2)j2....x(n)inx(n)jn and akal = x(1)k1x(1)l1x(2)k2x(2)l2....x(n)knx(n)ln. Explicitly, aiaj = akal whenever {it,jt}  =  {kt,lt}, t = 1,2,...,n.

Conversely, suppose that aiaj = akal whenever {it,jt}  =  {kt,lt}, t = 1,2,...,n. Let [formula], where t = 1,2,...,n. We can show |x(1)i1x(2)i2....x(n)in|2 = |ai1i2...in|2. We only demonstrate the cases of n = 2 and 3 to give the essential ideas of the general case.

When n = 2, see section 2. When n = 3, see appendix B. The two cases suggest that it be simpler to prove [formula]. Now we finish the argument for the real number case. It is not hard to extend the result to the complex number case.

The separability for a multi (n)-  partite system

Assume that each subsystem has the same dimension d. Let |it〉 be the orthonormal basis |0〉,|1〉,...,|(d - 1)〉 for the tth subsystem. Then any pure state |ψ〉 can be written as [formula]. Assume that |ψ〉 is separable. Then we can write [formula]. By tensor product x(1)i1x(2)i2....x(n)in = ai1i2...in, where i1,i2,...,in∈{0,1,...,(d - 1)}.

Let the density operator ρ12...n = |ψ〉〈ψ| and ρ12...(i - 1)(i + 1)...n be the reduced density operator obtained by tracing out the ith subsystem. Then ρ12...(i - 1)(i + 1)...n = tri(ρ12...n) = MiM+i, where i = 1,2,...,n and Mi are dn - 1  ×  d matrices of the amplitudes of the form

[formula], where k1,k2,...,ki - 1,ki + 1,...,kn∈{0,1,...,(d - 1)}.

There are two versions of the separability.

Version 1. |ψ〉 is separable if and only if the determinants of all the 2  ×  2 submatrices of M1, M2, ... and Mn are zero.

Version 2. |ψ〉 is separable if and only if ai1i2...inaj1j2...jn = ak1k2...knal1l2...ln, where {it,jt}  =  {kt,lt}, t = 1,2,...,n.

The proof of version 1 is similar to the one for a bipartite system. The proof of version 2 is similar to the one for a n - qubit system.

When n = 2, the criterion is reduced to the one for a bipartite system. When d = 2, the criterion is reduced to the one for a n-qubit system.

A necessary condition for a local unitary equivalence class for a bipartite system

We use the following lemma 2 to establish the necessary condition.

Lemma 2. Let |ψ〉 be a pure state of a composite system AB possessed by both Alice and Bob. Let M = (ajk)n  ×  n be the matrix of the amplitudes of |ψ〉. Let ρAB  =   |ψ〉〈ψ| and ρA = trB(ρAB). Then [formula] is just the product of the eigenvalues of ρA.

The proof is put in appendix C.

Lemma 2 reveals the relation between the determinant of the matrix of the amplitudes and the eigenvalues of ρA for a bipartite system.

The corollary of lemma 2

Let Mψ (Mφ) be the matrix of the amplitudes of a pure state |ψ〉 (|φ〉) of a composite system AB. Then [formula] whenever |ψ〉 ~   |φ〉. That is, [formula] is invariant under local unitary operators.

It is well known that it only needs O(n3) multiplication operations to compute [formula] instead of doing Schmidt decomposition in [\cite=Nielsen99][\cite=Peres].

For a two-qubit system, let |ψ〉 = a|00〉 + b|01〉 + c|10〉 + d|11〉 and ρ12 = |ψ〉〈ψ|. By lemma 2 |ad - bc|2 is the product of the eigenvalues of ρ1. Let |ad - bc| = ∈. We can show that ∈ satisfies [formula] and eigenvalues [formula]. Hence, [formula] or [formula].

The variance as a measure of entanglement

We obtain the necessary and sufficient conditions of separability in sections 2, 3 and 4. Apparently, [formula], where {it,jt}  =  {kt,lt}, t = 1,2,...,n., is just a deviation from a product state. It is intuitive to suggest the variance: [formula], where {it,jt}  =  {kt,lt}, t = 1,2,...,n, as a measure of entanglement of |ψ〉. Let DE(|ψ〉) be the measure of entanglement.

DE(|ψ〉) has the following properties.

Property 1. DE(|ψ〉) = 0 if and only if |ψ〉 is separable.

The properties for a two-qubit system

For a two-qubit system, let |ψ〉 = a|00〉 + b|01〉 + c|10〉 + d|11〉. Then [formula].

Property 2. The maximum of [formula]

When a,b,c and d are real, by computing extremum it is derived that the maximally entangled states must be of the forms: x|00〉 + y|01〉 - y|10〉 + x|11〉 or x|00〉 + y|01〉 + y|10〉 - x|11〉.

Property 3. |ψ〉 ~   [formula] if and only if [formula].

Given |ψ〉 = a|00〉 + b|01〉 + c|10〉 + d|11〉 and [formula]. Suppose that [formula]. By the necessary condition in section 5, [formula].

Conversely, suppose [formula]. Let us show [formula]. Using Schmidt decomposition, we can write [formula], where λ1  +  λ2 = 1. As discussed above [formula]. As well using Schmidt decomposition we can write [formula], where ρ1  +  ρ2 = 1, and [formula]. Thus λ1λ2  =  ρ1ρ2. Then λ1(1 - λ1) = ρ1(1 - ρ1). There are two cases. Case 1. λ1  =  ρ1. Then λ2  =  ρ2. Case 2. λ1  +  ρ1 + 1 = 0. In the case λ2  =  ρ1 and λ1  =  ρ2. It means that |ψ〉 and [formula] have the same Schmidt co-efficient for either of the two cases. By factor 5 in [\cite=Nielsen99][\cite=Peres], [formula].

Nielsen in [\cite=Nielsen99] showed [formula] ~   [formula] by calculating eigenvalue, where [formula], and [formula]. By property 3 it only needs to check [formula].

Conclusion

In this paper we have presented the necessary and sufficient conditions of separability for multipartite pure states. These conditions don't require Schmidt decomposition or tracing out operations. By using the conditions it is easy to check whether or not a multipartite pure state is entangled.

Appendix A. The proof of lemma 1

Let α1α2...αn, β1β2...βn, δ1δ2...δn and γ1γ2...γn be the n - bit strings of α, β, δ and γ, respectively.

Lemma 1. {αi, βi}={δi, γi}, i = 1,2,...,n, if and only if α  +  β  =  δ +   γ and [formula] [formula] γ, where [formula] indicates addition modulo 2.

Proof. Suppose {αi, βi}={δi, γi}, i = 1,2,...,n. Since α  +  β = (α1  +  β1)2n - 1 + (α2  +  β2)2n - 2 + ... + (αn  +  βn) and δ +   γ = (δ1  +  γ1)2n - 1 + (δ2  +  γ2)2n - 2 + ... + (δn  +  γn), by the supposition it is easy to see α  +  β  =  δ +   γ. It is straightforward to obtain [formula].

Conversely, suppose α  +  β  =  δ +   γ and [formula] [formula] γ. First let us consider the case where n = 1. There are three cases.

Case 1. α1  +  β1  =  δ1  +  γ1 = 0. This means α1  =  β1  =  δ1  =  γ1 = 0.

Case 2. α1  +  β1  =  δ1  +  γ1 = 1. This implies {α1,β1}  =  {δ1,γ1}  =  {1,0}.

Case 3. α1  +  β1  =  δ1  +  γ1 = 2.  This says α1  =  β1  =  δ1  =  γ1 = 1.

No matter which of the above three cases happens, it yields {α1, β1}={δ1, γ1}.

Let us consider the case n. Since α  +  β  =  δ +   γ, (α1  +  β1)2n - 1 + (α2  +  β2)2n - 2 + ... + (αn  +  βn) = (δ1  +  γ1)2n - 1 + (δ2  +  γ2)2n - 2 + ... + (δn  +  γn). Again since [formula] [formula] γ, that is, [formula], we obtain [formula], i = 1,2,...,n.  There are two cases.

Case 1. [formula]. In the case {αn, βn}  =  {δn, γn}  =  {0,1}. Then (α1  +  β1)2n - 2 + (α2  +  β2)2n - 3 + ... + (αn - 1  +  βn - 1) = (δ1  +  γ1)2n - 2 + (δ2  +  γ2)2n - 3 + ... + (δn - 1  +  γn - 1)   and [formula], i = 1,2,...,n - 1. By induction hypothesis {αi,βi}  =  {δi,γi}, i = 1,2,...,n - 1.

Case 2. [formula]. There are two subcases.

Subcase 2.1. αn  =  βn  =  δn  =  γn = 0 or αn  =  βn  =  δn  =  γn = 1. As discussed in case 1, we can obtain {αi,βi}  =  {δi,γi}, i = 1,2,...,n - 1 by induction hypothesis.

Subcase 2.2. αn  =  βn = 1 and δn  =  γn = 0 or αn  =  βn = 0 and δn  =  γn = 1. Let us consider the former case. In the case (α1  +  β1)2n - 2 + (α2  +  β2)2n - 3 + ... + (αn - 2  +  βn - 2)2 + (αn - 1  +  βn - 1 + 1) =

(δ1  +  γ1)2n - 2 + (δ2  +  γ2)2n - 3 + ... + (δn - 2  +  γn - 2)2 + (δn - 1  +  γn - 1).

Since [formula], either [formula] or 1 causes that one of (αn - 1  +  βn - 1 + 1) and (δn - 1  +  γn - 1) is odd and the other is even. It contradicts [formula] [formula] γ.   Appendix B. The separability for a n - qubit system

When n = 3, let us show |x(1)i1x(2)i2x(3)i3|2 = |ai1i2i3|2 when aiaj = akal, where {it,jt}  =  {kt,lt}, t = 1,2,3. We only illustrate |x(1)0x(2)0x(3)0|2 = |a000|2. Other cases then follow readily. Experientially, it is simpler to prove |x(1)0x(2)0x(3)0|2 [formula], where [formula], [formula] and [formula].

First we show that a0ijak0lapq0 can be rewritten as a000aα1α2α3aδ1δ2δ3. There are the following four cases.

Case 1. Consider a0ijak0l and the pairs {0,k},{i,0} and {j,l}. If [formula] , then a0ijak0l = a000aki(j + l) since {j,l}  =  {0,j + l}.

Case 2. Consider a0ijapq0 and the pairs {0,p},{i,q} and {j,0}. If [formula], then a0ijapq0 = a000ap(i + q)j since {i,q}  =  {0,i + q}.

Case 3. Consider ak0lapq0 and the pairs {k,p},{0,q} and {l,0}. If [formula], then ak0lapq0 = a000a(k + p)ql since {k,p}  =  {0,k + p}.

Case 4. Otherwise i = j = l = k = p = q = 1. It is not hard to derive a3a5a6 = a1a7a6 = a0a27.

Second, let us show that a000aα1α2α3aδ1δ2δ3 can be rewritten as a0ijak0lapq0. If a000aα1α2α3aδ1δ2δ3 is of the forms: a000a0ijak0l, a000a0ijapq0 or a000ak0lapq0, then these forms are desired. Otherwise a000aα1α2α3aδ1δ2δ3 must be a0a6a6, a0a3a3, a0a5a5 or of the form a0a7arst, which can be rewritten as a2a4a6, a1a2a3, a1a4a5, a1a6arst, respectively. a2a4a6, a1a2a3 and a1a4a5 are just desired and a1a6arst is furthermore rewritten as follows. There are three cases.

Case 1. In the case r = 0 or s = 0, this is desired.

Case 2. In the case r = s = t = 1, a1a6a7 = a3a5a6, desired.

Case 3. In the case r = s = 1 and t = 0, a1a6a6 = a2a5a6, desired.

Appendix C. The proof of lemma 2

Proof. Suppose that systems A and B have the same dimensions n. Let [formula]. Then M = (aij)n  ×  n. Let density operator ρAB = |ψ〉〈ψ|. Then [formula]

[formula]. The reduced density operator for system A is defined by ρA = trB(ρAB). Let us compute ρA.

[formula] (where δkj = 1 when k = j. Otherwise 0.) [formula]. Let Ai = (ai0,ai1,....ai(n - 1)), that is, the ith row of A. Then [formula]. Finally [formula]A[formula]A[formula] [formula]A[formula]. Thus det (ρA) = | det (M)|2. Hence [formula] is just the product of the eigenvalues of ρA. Q.E.D.
