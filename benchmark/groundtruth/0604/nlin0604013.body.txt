Introduction

The aim of the present paper is devoted to the rather old but still open problem how to construct exact periodic solutions of integrable and nonintegrable soliton systems. This problem is important from the physical point of view to study nonlinear waves. These solutions are expressed in terms of Hermite and Lamé polynomials. Results are presented both for integrable and nonintegrable dynamical systems. As examples optical cascading equations and vector nonlinear Schrödinger equation are considered.

Optical cascading equations and phase-locked solutions

We consider χ(2):χ(2) cascading equations in the normalized form

[formula]

where a1 and a2 are the normalized complex envelopes of FW and SHW, respectively, t is the normalized distance along the wave guide, and x is the normalized transverse coordinate. The real constant α is given by minus ratio of the wave numbers of the FW and SHW, the quantity β corresponds to the normalized wave number mismatch and the parameter δ corresponds to normalized walkoff coefficient, r =   ±  1.

We seek solution of ([\ref=OCE]) in the following form

[formula]

with ξ  =  ωx - vt and we define φ  =  φ2 - 2φ1. We will consider phase-locked solutions (φ = kπ, [formula], then the system ([\ref=OCE]) is reduced to two ordinary differential equations,

[formula]

where we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

Introducing new variable

[formula]

where F is Hermite polynomial [\cite=ww86], g2,g3 are elliptic invariants defined in [\cite=ww86]. [formula] is Weierstrass function shifted by half period ω' is related to [formula] Jacobian elliptic function with modulus k

[formula]

where [formula] and ei,  i = 1,2,3,  e3  ≤  e2  ≤  e1 are the real roots of the cubic equation

[formula]

Using wave height α and modulus [formula] we have the following relations

[formula]

Inserting this expression in ([\ref=ROCE1]) we have the following nonlinear differential equation with spectral parameter λ =  - C0 / 2

[formula]

with eigenvalue equations

[formula]

or in factorized form

[formula]

It is well known that equation ([\ref=Feq]) is reduced to linear periodic spectral problem of one dimensional Schrödinger equation with two gap potential [formula] and with five normalized eigenfunctions q(i)1, [formula]:

[formula]

Under these conditions the second equation ([\ref=ROCE2]) is automatically satisfied. Second equation can be considered as "self-consistent" equation for potential u(ξ). Finally the five spectral families of periodic solutions can be written in the following Table [\ref=tab:1]

where

[formula]

are normalized two-gap Lamé functions [\cite=ww86], [formula], [formula] are Jacobian elliptic functions and potential u(ξ) have the form

[formula]

If, however, we restrict ourselves to using solitary waves that corresponds to limit k  →  1, for FW q1 we have the following forms (case I): [formula]; case (II) and (V):   2(αξ); case (III) and (IV):   (αξ)(αξ), the red, white and blue solitary waves respectively. These wavetrains, so called order two solitary waves are well known phenomena only in the case of coupled nonlinear Schrödinger equations [\cite=hioe98], [\cite=aa99].

The theory of optical cascading in materials with a pure quadratic (or χ(2)) nonlinearity became the subject of many theoretical and experimental investigations. In the case of χ(2) materials it has been possible to produce solitary waves and periodic solutions as background trough χ(2):χ(2) cascading. This effect occurs in parametrically coupled fields with quadratic nonlinearities and interacting fundamental (FW) and second harmonic (SHW) waves. Several particular wave solutions of the system describing this phenomenon have been obtained, e.g. with the aid of the Hamiltonian formalism [\cite=ft95], direct substitution [\cite=p98] [\cite=pt99] [\cite=pp02], and Lie group analysis [\cite=lwm98]. General families of periodic waves are reported recently in [\cite=kvt03] [\cite=kezvt04].

Vector nonlinear Schrödinger equation

We consider the system of coupled nonlinear Schrödinger equations

[formula]

where s =   ±  1, σ  =    ±  1. These equations are important for a number of physical applications. For example, for photorefractive media with a drift mechanism of nonlinear response, a good approximation describing the propagation of n self-trapped mutually incoherent wave packets is the set of equations for a Kerr-type nonlinearity [\cite=kpsv98]

[formula]

where j denotes the jth component of the beam, α is a coefficient representing the strength of nonlinearity, z' and x' are the coordinate along the direction of propagation and transverse coordinate respectively. The change in refractive index profile η created by all the incoherent components in the light beam is defined by

[formula]

Inserting ([\ref=index]) in ([\ref=photorefEq]) and renormalising the variables as [formula], z' = 2t,x' = x we obtain the vector nonlinear Schrödinger equation ([\ref=VNLSE]). Stability, localization, and soliton asymptotics of multicomponent photorefractive cnoidal waves are discussed in [\cite=psv99]. New solutions are presented next for the case n = 3,4.

We seek solution of ([\ref=VNLSE]) in the following form [\cite=eek00])

[formula]

where z = x - ct, Θj  =  Θj(z,t), with qj,Θj real. Substituting ([\ref=ansatz]) into ([\ref=VNLSE]) and separating real and imaginary parts by supposing that the functions [formula] behave as

[formula]

we obtain the system (σ  =  s  =    ±  1)

[formula]

where Cj, [formula] are free parameters and Θj0 are constants. These equations describe the integrable case of motion of a particle in a quartic potential perturbed with inverse squared potential, which is separable in ellipsoidal coordinates. The solutions of the system ([\ref=systemn]) are then given as

[formula]

where F(z,λ) is Hermite polynomial associated with Lamé potential. The final formula for the solutions of the system ([\ref=VNLSE]) then reads

[formula]

where

[formula]

and [formula] and we have made use of ([\ref=answern1]) and ([\ref=ansatz]). To obtain the special class of periodic solution of ([\ref=systemn]) we introduce the following ansatses

[formula]

As a result we obtain:

[formula]

and using the well known relations

[formula]

and

[formula]

We derive the following result

[formula]

where

[formula]

One special solution is written by

[formula]

where

[formula]

in the limit k  →  1 we obtain soliton solution

[formula]

where we introduce the following notations

[formula]

where x0 is the position of soliton, εj,j = 1,2,3 are the components of polarization vector. One notes that the real part of ζ1 i.e. c / 2 gives us the soliton velocity while the imaginary part of ζ1 i.e. [formula] gives the soliton amplitude and width. Another special solution is written by

[formula]

where

[formula]

in the limit k  →  1 we obtain the following soliton solution

[formula]

where we introduce the following notations

[formula]

To obtain the class of periodic solutions of system ([\ref=systemn]) for n = 3,4 we introduce the following two ansatses in terms of the Weierstrass function [formula]

[formula]

where [formula]. Next for conciseness we denote [formula], then the second ansatz have the form

[formula]

with the constants Ai,Bi,Ci,Di,Ei defined from the compatibility condition of the ansatz with the equations of motion ([\ref=systemn]). Inserting ([\ref=Hansatz]) and ([\ref=Hansatz1]) into Eqs. ([\ref=systemn]), using the basic equations for Weierstrass [formula] function [\cite=ww86]

[formula]

and equating to zero the coefficients at different powers of [formula] we obtain the following algebraic equations for the parameters of the solutions Ai,Bi,Ci,Di,i = 1,2,3 for n = 3

[formula]

The analogical algebraic system for n = 4 is as follows

[formula]

Another result from the algebraic systems is the expression for constants Ci which parametrize our solutions. For them we obtain

[formula]

where i,k = 3    4 and parameters ν are defined by (for n = 3)

[formula]

and (for n = 4)

[formula]

Using the general formulae, we will consider below the physically important cases of n = 3,4 [\cite=psv99] which are associated with the three-gap [formula], and four-gap elliptic potentials [formula].

The Hermite polynomial [formula] associated to the Lamé potential [formula] has the form

[formula]

The solution is real under the choice of the arbitrary constants [formula] in such way, that the constants [formula] lie in different lacunae. Comparing ([\ref=Hansatz]) and ([\ref=HerPol3]) and using ([\ref=answern1]) the solutions of polynomial equations ([\ref=Peq1]),([\ref=Peq2]),([\ref=Peq3]) can be given by

[formula]

The Hermite polynomial [formula] associated to the Lamé potential [formula] can be written as

[formula]

Comparing ([\ref=Hansatz1]) and ([\ref=HerPol4]) and using ([\ref=answern1]) the solutions of polynomial equations ([\ref=Pequ1]-[\ref=Pequ4]) can be given by

[formula]

Next solution of system ([\ref=systemn],n = 3) we obtain using the following ansatz

[formula]

then we have

[formula]

where λ =  - 3Bi / Ai. More complicated solution we can obtain as a special solution of last polynomial system

[formula]

where

[formula]

Another solution is written by

[formula]

where

[formula]

Next solution is given by

[formula]

where

[formula]

From last three solutions in the limit k  →  1 we obtain the following soliton solutions

[formula]

where we introduce the following notations

[formula]

Another type solution in the limit k  →  1 have the following form

[formula]

where we introduce the following notations

[formula]

Lamé polynomials and multicomponent cnoidal waves

Next we skip the details of derivation of exact solutions and give only the final results for special case n = 3 and all Cj = 0 using methods presented in [\cite=eek00]. The (2n + 1) Lamé polynomials of order n are solutions of

[formula]

For n = 3 we introduce the following eigenfunctions functions [formula] and eigenvalues λi given in table [\ref=tab:2], [formula] and the constants C(3)i given in table [\ref=tab:3].

Next we enumerate the periodic solutions of the system ([\ref=systemn]) σ = 1, s = 1, n = 3. The results are collected in Table [\ref=tab:4]. For convenience we present solutions in the following form

[formula]

and

[formula]

where i  ≠  j  ≠  k and

[formula]

For defocusing case σ =  - 1, s = 1, n = 3 we have presented solutions in Table [\ref=tab:5].

Conclusions

In this paper we find five different families of periodic solutions of optical cascading equations related to eigenvalues of Lamé equation with two-gap potential. We investigate also localized solitary wave solutions as a special limit of periodic solutions.

The existence of two-gap solutions expressed as product of two elliptic functions can be viewed as manifestation of "partial integrability" of these equations. We expected that both group theoretical method [\cite=lwm98] and spectral method will lead us to new understanding of "partial integrability" of optical cascading equations.

For vector nonlinear Schrödinger equation n = 3,4 we present exact solutions in a form of multicomponent cnoidal waves. Multicomponent cnoidal waves are previously discussed in [\cite=psv99].
