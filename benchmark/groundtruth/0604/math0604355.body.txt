The Volume Entropy of a Riemannian Metric Evolving by the Ricci Flow on a Manifold of Dimension 3 or Above

Lemma Proposition Corollary Definition Example Remark Observation

Introduction

Consider on a compact manifold M of dimension greater the 3 a riemannian metric evolving by the Ricci Flow : [formula]. In [\cite=manning] A. Manning studies the volume entropy of a surface evolving under the normalized Ricci Flow. Here, the author studies the volume entropy of a manifold of dimension 3 or above, evolving by the unnormalized flow, in connection with collapsing riemannian manifolds. In [\cite=per1] G. Perelman proves a noncollapsing theorem for a solution to the Ricci flow that develops finite time singularities. Despite this, a solution g(t) that exists [formula], could collapse. The present paper deals with this case.

Let π:  →  M be the universal cover of M. Geometric data on [formula] will be denoted with tilde (such as [formula] for the scalar curvature) to be distinguished from the data on M. Consider The Ricci Flow on [formula]: [formula] and the one on M: [formula]. If (0) is the covering riemannian metric of g(o) then, as symmetries are preserved by the Ricci flow, (t) will be the covering riemannian metric of g(t), for all t for which the two solution exist.

By definition, the volume growth function of a compact riemannin manifold (M,g) is [formula], where (r) is the radius r ball in the universal cover (,) (the center of the ball doesn't matter). The volume entropy is the quantity h(M,g) = limr  →    ∞ω(M,g,r).

Evolution of The Volume Entropy

Consider the volume growth function of (M,g(t)), [formula]. We have that [formula] [formula] [formula] [formula] [formula]. Since, as in [\cite=ham1], the riemannian measure evolves under the Ricci Flow by

[formula]

we shall have [formula] [formula].

Thus, since the second term vanishes, we obtain the evolution

[formula]

for the volume growth function. Now, the injectivity radius of the universal riemannian cover satisfies i(,(t))  ≥  i(M,g(t))  ≥  i so, by a theorem from [\cite=shen] that generalizes [\cite=bg] we have that

[formula]

for some positive [formula], so

[formula]

Therefore, from equation [\ref=evolutia], for r  →    ∞  , we get [formula].

For the second assertion, we have that [formula], where dσ(t) is the restriction of the riemannian measure of the universal cover to the sphere S̃(r(t)), and H̃ denotes the mean curvature of the sphere. Thus, via equation ([\ref=evolutia]), we get

[formula]

and this is a heat equation! Now, assuming by hypothesis that [formula] [formula], in equation ([\ref=heateq]) above the last three terms are positive, which implies that

[formula]

In this point of the proof, we can apply the maximum principle for a supersolution to the equation ([\ref=supersol]). In order to do this, consider the ODE [formula] which has the solution x = Ce( - 2 / r2)t. By the maximum principle, the ODE gives pointwise bounds to the PDE, so

[formula]

and this happens for all r. Taking limit as r  →    ∞  , we get

[formula]

Let [formula]. By repeating the argument above with tk as origin, we obtain that h(M,g(t)) is nondecreasing. [formula]

The Volume Entropy and The Limit Solutions

Since a riemannian covering   →  M, beign a local isometry, has |m(y)| = |Rm(π(y))|, we shall omit the tilde in the following computation, to simplify notations.

Let (xi,ti) a sequence of points xi∈M and times [formula] which converges to the singular time T. Then, a parabolic rescaling of the metric is given by the formula

[formula]

Hence, the volume of balls changes according to

[formula]

so

[formula]

and equation ([\ref=parabolic]) follows. [formula]

Let (M∞,g∞(t)) be the limit solution. Consider a type I solution, i.e. a solution that exhibits a singularity in finite time T and [formula]. Assume |Rm(xi,ti)| has not polynomial growth, i.e. [formula] for some positive p, hence [formula], so [formula] and this contradicts the fact that ti  →  T. Therefore |Rm(xi,ti)| has polynomial growth, and by equation ([\ref=parabolic])

[formula]

so h(M∞,g∞(t)) =  lim t  →  Th(M,g(t)).

Consider now a type III solution, i.e. a solution that does not exhibit a singularity in finite time, and [formula]. Assume again |Rm(xi,ti)| has not polynomial growth, i.e. [formula] for some positive p and repeat the above reasoning. Follows that h(M∞,g∞(t)) =  lim t  →    ∞h(M,g(t)) which completes the proof.
