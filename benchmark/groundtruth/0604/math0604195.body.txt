Universal torsors of Del Pezzo surfacesand homogeneous spaces

Introduction

In this note we continue our investigations of universal torsors over Del Pezzo surfaces over an algebraically closed field [formula] of characteristic 0. The blow-up Sr of [formula] in r  ≤  8 points in general position is a smooth Del Pezzo surface of degree 9 - r; we will assume that [formula]. A smooth Del Pezzo surface of degree 3 (resp. degree 2) is a smooth cubic surface in [formula] (resp. a double cover of [formula] ramified in a smooth curve of degree 4). The Picard group [formula] is a lattice with a non-degenerate symmetric linear form (  ·  ,  ·  ), the intersection form. It is well-known that [formula] contains a canonical root system Rr, which carries the action of the associated Weyl group Wr, see Table [\ref=tab:weyl_groups] and [\cite=MR833513].

It was a general expectation that the Weyl group symmetry on [formula] should be a reflection of a geometric link between Del Pezzo surfaces and algebraic groups. Here we show that universal torsors of smooth Del Pezzo surfaces of degree 2 and 3 admit an embedding into a certain flag variety for the corresponding algebraic group. The degree 5 case goes back to Salberger (talk at the Borel seminar Bern, June 1993) following Mumford [\cite=MR0437531], and independently Skorobogatov [\cite=MR1260765]. The degree 4 case was treated in the thesis of Popov [\cite=popov_diplom]. The existence of such an embedding in general was conjectured by Batyrev in his lecture at the conference Diophantine geometry (Universität Göttingen, June 2004). Skorobogatov announced related work in progress (joint with Serganova) at the conference Cohomological approaches to rational points (MSRI, March 2006).

As in [\cite=MR2029863], the simple roots of Rr - 1 (with [formula]) can be identified with a subset Ir of the simple roots of Rr such that the edges in the Dynkin diagrams are respected. The complement of Ir in Rr consists of exactly one simple root αr, with associated fundamental weight ϖr. Let Gr be a simply connected linear algebraic group associated to Rr, and fix a Borel group containing a maximal torus. The Weyl group Wr acts on the weight lattice of Gr. The fundamental representation ϱr of Gr with highest weight ϖr has dimension Nr as listed in Table [\ref=tab:weyl_groups]; the weights of ϱr can be identified with classes of curves E  ⊂  Sr with self-intersection number (E,E)  =   - 1, so called ( - 1)-curves.

Let Pr be the maximal parabolic subgroup corresponding to Ir. By [\cite=MR541023], we can regard the Gr-orbit Hr of the weight space to ϖr as the affine cone over Gr / Pr, and Hr is given by quadratic equations in affine space [formula]. For r = 6, the equations are all partial derivatives of a certain cubic form on the 27-dimensional representation ϱ6 of G6. For r = 7, equations can be found in [\cite=MR0054609]. In both cases, the equations were already known to E. Cartan in the 19th century. See Section [\ref=sec:homogeneous_spaces] for more details on Gr, ϱr, and Hr for r∈{6,7}.

The universal torsor Tr over Sr is defined as follows: Let [formula] be a basis of [formula], and let [formula]. Then

[formula]

It is a [formula]-bundle over Sr, where [formula] is the Néron-Severi torus of Sr.

The total coordinate ring, or Cox ring of Sr is defined as

[formula]

as a vectorspace, and the multiplication is induced by the multiplication of sections (see [\cite=MR2001i:14059] and [\cite=MR2029863]). It is naturally graded by [formula], and it is generated by Nr sections corresponding to the ( - 1)-curves on Sr. The ideal of relations in [formula] is generated by certain quadratic relations which are homogeneous with respect to the [formula]-grading (see [\cite=MR2029863] for more details). Let [formula] be the corresponding affine variety. The universal torsor Tr is an open subset of [formula] (cf. [\cite=MR2001i:14059]). See [\cite=MR2029868] and [\cite=math.AG/0604194] for the calculation of universal torsors and Cox rings for singular Del Pezzo surfaces and [\cite=math.AG/0603111] for the smooth cases.

Universal torsors can be applied to Manin's conjecture (see [\cite=MR89m:11060] and [\cite=MR1032922]) on the number of rational points of bounded height on Del Pezzo surfaces. For the moment, let the Del Pezzo surface Sr be defined over a number field k, and let [formula] be the anticanonical height function. Let U be the complement of the ( - 1)-curves on Sr. Then Manin's conjecture predicts that

[formula]

behaves asymptotically as

[formula]

for some positive constant c, where n is the rank of the Picard group (over k) of Sr.

In results concerning Manin's conjecture for various Del Pezzo surfaces (see [\cite=math.NT/0511041] and [\cite=math.NT/0604193] for an overview), often the first step is a translation of the counting problem for rational points on Sr to the counting of integral points in certain ranges on a universal torsor Tr. The number of these points on Tr can then be estimated using techniques from analytic number theory.

Salberger [\cite=MR1679841] gave a proof of Manin's conjecture for toric varieties, which include smooth Del Pezzo surfaces of degree ≥  6, using universal torsors. De la Bretèche [\cite=MR1909606] used Salberger's and Skorobogatov's description of the universal torsor as a homogeneous space in his proof of the asymptotic formula for a Del Pezzo surface of degree 5. In lower degrees, Manin's conjecture has been proved only for examples of singular Del Pezzo surfaces (see [\cite=math.NT/0509370] for a singular cubic surface, using the universal torsor), but it is a general expectation that universal torsors should lead to a proof of Manin's conjecture also in the remaining smooth cases.

We have seen that both [formula] and Hr can be viewed as embedded into [formula], with a natural identification of the coordinates. For the embedding of [formula], we have some freedom: As the generators of [formula] are canonical only up to a non-zero constant, we can choose a rescaling factor for each of the Nr coordinates, giving a Nr-parameter family of embeddings of [formula] into affine space. The task is to find a rescaling such that [formula] is embedded into Hr.

More precisely, we start with an arbitrary embedding

[formula]

and view

[formula]

as embedded into a different affine space. An isomorphism [formula] such that

[formula]

for each of the Nr coordinates, with [formula], is called a rescaling, and the factors ξ''(E) are (a system of) rescaling factors. A rescaling φr which embeds [formula] into Hr is called a good rescaling.

Our main result is:

Let Sr be a smooth Del Pezzo surface of degree 9 - r and [formula] the affine variety described above. Let Hr be the affine cone over the flag variety Gr / Pr associated to the root system Rr as in Table [\ref=tab:weyl_groups].

For r∈{6,7}, there exists a (Nr - 2 + 2)-parameter family of good rescalings φr which embed [formula] into Hr.

The number Nr - 2 + 2 of parameters is 12 for r = 6, respectively 18 for r = 7.

The rescaling factors are naturally graded by [formula], and we will see in Section [\ref=sec:rescalings] that the conditions for good rescaling are homogeneous with respect to this grading. Therefore, for each good rescaling φr, there is a (r + 1)-parameter family of good rescalings which differ from φr only by the action of [formula]. Similarly, [formula] acts on [formula], and it is easy to see that the image of [formula] in Hr is the same for all good rescalings in the same (r + 1)-parameter family. Therefore, the (Nr - 2 + 2)-parameter family of good rescalings gives rise to a (Nr - 2 - r + 1)-parameter family (where Nr - 2 - r + 1 equals 5 for r = 6, resp. 10 for r = 7) of images of [formula] in Hr.

For r = 5, we have Nr - 2 - r + 1  =  2, and by [\cite=popov_diplom], there is a two-parameter family of images of [formula] under good rescalings in H5.

In Section [\ref=sec:del_pezzo], we summarize results of [\cite=MR2029863] and [\cite=math.AG/0603111] on Cox rings of Del Pezzo surfaces of degree 3 and 2. In Section [\ref=sec:homogeneous_spaces], we recall the classical equations for the homogeneous spaces Gr / Pr and give a simplified description on a certain Zariski open subset; this will help to find good rescalings. In Section [\ref=sec:rescalings], we derive conditions on the rescaling factors in terms of the description of [formula] and Gr / Pr. In Section [\ref=sec:degree_3] and Section [\ref=sec:degree_2], we determine good rescalings in degree 3 and 2, finishing the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:main].

Cox rings of Del Pezzo surfaces

In this section, we describe the Cox ring of Del Pezzo surfaces of degree 3 and 2 in order to fix some notation. The results can be found in [\cite=MR2029863] and [\cite=math.AG/0603111].

Let r∈{6,7}. Without loss of generality, we may assume that four of the r blown-up points in [formula] giving Sr are in the positions By [\cite=MR2029863], the generators of [formula] are sections ξ(E) vanishing in a ( - 1)-curve E on Sr. Their number is Nr as in Table [\ref=tab:weyl_groups]. We use the same symbols ξ(E) for the coordinates in [formula]. Let - Kr be the anticanonical divisor class of Sr.

A (k)-ruling [formula] is the sum of two ( - 1)-curves whose intersection number is k, cf. [\cite=MR2029863] and [\cite=math.AG/0603111]. The relations come in groups of r - 3 for each (1)-ruling D. We will denote them by

[formula]

For r = 7, we have further relations corresponding to the (2)-ruling - K7. The ideal Jr generated by these relations defines [formula] (see [\cite=MR2029863] for r  ≤  6 and [\cite=math.AG/0603111] for r = 7).

For r  =  6, we assume

[formula]

The N6 = 27 ( - 1)-curves E are denoted by Ei, mi,j, and Qi corresponding to the six blown-up points, the 15 transforms of the lines through two of the six points, and the six transforms of the conics through five points as described in [\cite=math.AG/0603111]. Let ηi: = ξ(Ei), μi,j: = ξ(mi,j), and λi: = ξ(Qi). We order them in the following way:

[formula]

The (1)-rulings are - K6 - E, where E runs through the ( - 1)-curves. We have

[formula]

where the 81 equations [formula] are listed in [\cite=math.AG/0603111].

For r = 7, let

[formula]

The N7 = 56 ( - 1)-curves Ei,mi,j,Qi,j,Ci and the corresponding generators ξ(E) are described in [\cite=math.AG/0603111]. They are ordered as

[formula]

By [\cite=math.AG/0603111], there are 529 relations FD,i (four for each of the 126 (1)-rulings, and 25 for the (2)-ruling - K7) between them. We do not want to list them here, as they can be determined by the method of [\cite=math.AG/0603111] in a straightforward manner.

Homogeneous spaces

In this section, we examine the equations defining the affine cone [formula] over Gr / Pr for r∈{6,7}. For the Nr coordinates ξ'(E) of [formula], we also use the names η'i, μ'i,j, λ'i, and furthermore ν'i,j in the case r = 7, with the obvious correspondence to the coordinates of [formula] as in the previous section.

In particular, we show that Hr is a complete intersection on the open subset Ur of [formula] where the coordinates [formula] are non-zero.

We will see that Hr is defined by quadratic relations which are homogeneous with respect to the [formula]-grading. For each (1)-ruling D, we have exactly one relation pD of degree D, and furthermore in the case r = 7, we have eight relations [formula] where we use the convention p- K7: = p(1)- K7. For any possibility to write D as the sum of two ( - 1)-curves E, E', the relation pD has a term ξ'(E)ξ'(E') with a non-zero coefficient.

For a ( - 1)-curve E, let UE be the open subset of [formula] where ξ'(E) is non-zero. Let N(E)k be the set of ( - 1)-curves E' with (E,E')  =  k, and let Ξ'(E)k be the set of the corresponding ξ'(E'). Let N(E)> k and Ξ'(E)> k be defined similarly, but with the condition (E,E')  >  k.

Let [formula] be the intersection of [formula].

Note that N(E)0 has exactly Nr - 1 elements because we can identify its elements with the ( - 1)-curves on Sr - 1. Since the only ( - 1)-curve intersecting E negatively is E itself, the number of elements of N(E)> 0 is Nr - Nr - 1 - 1.

Let

[formula]

be the projection to the coordinates ξ'(E)∈Ξ'(E1)0 and η'1. The map Φr is an isomorphism. The dimension of Hr is Nr - 1 + 1.

If D = E1 + E is a (1)-ruling, then (E1,D) = 0, and all variables occurring in pD besides η'1 and ξ'(E) are elements of Ξ'(E1)0. For η'1  ≠  0, the relation pD expresses ξ'(E) in terms of η'1 and Ξ'(E1)0.

For a (2)-ruling D = E1 + E, we have (E1,D) = 1, so the relation pD expresses ξ'(E) in terms of η'1 and monomials ξ'(Ei')ξ'(Ei'') where ξ(Ei')∈Ξ'(E1)0 and ξ'(Ei'')∈Ξ'(E1)1. Using the expressions for the elements of Ξ'(E1)1 of the first step, this shows that we can express the coordinates Ξ'(E1)> 0 in terms of η'1 and Ξ'(E1)0 by using the Nr - Nr - 1 - 1 relations gE1 + E for E∈N(E)> 0. This allows us to construct a map

[formula]

It remains to show that the image of Ψr is in Hr, i.e., that the resulting point also satisfies the remaining equations which define Hr. This is done in Lemma [\ref=lem:homspace_degree3] and Lemma [\ref=lem:homspace_degree2] below.

Proposition [\ref=prop:homspace] is also true if we enlarge Ur to UE1 and Ur - 1 to [formula]. However, the proofs of Lemma [\ref=lem:homspace_degree3] and Lemma [\ref=lem:homspace_degree2] are slightly simplified by restricting to Ur.

First, we consider the case r = 6. Consider the cubic form in N6 = 27 variables

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

By [\cite=MR2235344], the group of invertible N6  ×  N6-matrices which leave invariant F is a simply connected linear algebraic group G6 of type [formula].

Note that the terms of [formula] are M(i,j)1M(j,k)2M(k,i)3 for i,j,k∈{1,2,3} (where M(b,c)a is the entry (b,c) of the matrix Ma), so the number of terms of F is 3  ·  6 + 33 = 45. Each is a product of three variables ξ'(E), ξ'(E'), ξ'(E'') such that the corresponding ( - 1)-curves E, E', E'' on S6 form a triangle, and their divisor classes add up to - K6. The coefficient is + 1 in the nine cases and - 1 in the remaining 36 cases. (Of course, there is some choice here, for example by permuting the indices [formula], but it is not as simple as choosing any 9 of the 45 terms to have the coefficient + 1. See [\cite=MR1854697] for more details.)

Let α6 be the simple root at the end of one of the "long legs" in the Dynkin diagram [formula]. Let ϖ6 be the associated fundamental weight. The action of G6 on [formula] is a N6-dimensional irreducible representation of G6 whose highest weight is ϖ6 (cf. [\cite=MR0106966]). The orbit H6 of the weight space of ϖ6 is described by the vanishing of the N6 partial derivatives of the cubic form F (see [\cite=MR1234494]).

The derivative with respect to ξ'(E) contains five terms ±  ξ'(E')ξ'(E'') corresponding to the five ways to write the (1)-ruling D: =  - K6 - E as the sum of two intersecting ( - 1)-curves E',E''. We will denote it by pD  =  p- K6 - E.

For η'1  ≠  0 and any values of

[formula]

with non-zero [formula], the equations pE1 + E for

[formula]

define a point of H6.

As [formula] acts on H6 and [formula] is a subset of a basis of [formula], we may assume that [formula]. Then for [formula], the equation pE1 + m1,i allows us to express μ'1,i in terms of the remaining μ'i,j: Furthermore, for [formula], we can use pE1 + Qi in order to express λ'i in terms of λ'1 and μ'j,k: By substituting and expanding, we check that the remaining 17 relations are fulfilled. Therefore, the resulting point lies in H6.

Next, we obtain similar results in the case r = 7 with N7 = 56. By [\cite=MR2235344], a simply connected linear algebraic group G7 of type [formula] is obtained as the identity component of the group of invertible N7  ×  N7-matrices which leave invariant a certain quartic form defined on a vectorspace of dimension N7 as in [\cite=MR2235344]. The action of G7 on this vectorspace is an irreducible representation whose highest weight ϖ7 is the fundamental weight corresponding to the simple root α7 at the end of the "longest leg" of the Dynkin diagram [formula] (cf. [\cite=MR0106966]).

We describe the orbit H7 of the weight space of ϖ7 under G7 explicitly. The N7 coordinates ξ'(E) in [formula] are ηi',μj,k',νj,k',λ'i for [formula] and j  <  k. The equations for H7 are described in [\cite=MR0054609] in terms of 56 coordinates xij,yij ([formula]). They correspond to our variables as follows:

[formula]

For the (1)-rulings D [\cite=math.AG/0603111], the relations pD are uijkl and vij as below. In the first column of Table [\ref=tab:relations_degree2], we list a symbol D(n)I assigned to the (1)-ruling in the second column, and the third column gives the corresponding relation.

Let

[formula]

where i < j < k < l and a < b < c < d, with (i,j,k,l,a,b,c,d) a permutation of [formula], and σ its sign. For i  ≠  j

[formula]

where xba =  - xab and yba =  - yab if b > a.

For the (2)-ruling - K7, we have the following eight equations with 28 terms:

[formula]

For [formula], the 28 coordinates

[formula]

in Ξ'(E1)0 and the 28 equations pD for

[formula]

define

[formula]

resulting in a point on H7.

Furthermore, we may replace p- K by pD for D = D(3)2,1.

As above, we may assume that [formula] because of the action of [formula]. For the 27 ( - 1)-curves E∈N(E1)1, the equation pE1 + E defines ξ'(E) directly in terms of the 28 variables in Ξ'(E1)0; we do not list the expressions here. By substituting these results, we use v11 in order to express λ'1 in terms of these variables: We check directly by substituting and expanding that the remaining equations defining H7 are fulfilled.

As v21 contains the term η'2λ'1, and η'2  ≠  0, we may replace v11 by v21.

Rescalings

Let r∈{6,7}. We follow the strategy of the case r = 5 [\cite=popov_diplom] in order to describe conditions for good rescalings explicitly in terms of the rescaling factors. However, we use the results of the previous section to simplify this as follows:

Let

[formula]

and let

[formula]

Let [formula] be the variety defined by the equations gD for D∈Mr.

By Proposition [\ref=prop:homspace], Lemma [\ref=lem:homspace_degree3], and Lemma [\ref=lem:homspace_degree2], [formula].

Because of N(E1)2  =  {C1}, it could be considered more natural to use - K7 = E1 + C1 instead of D(3)2,1 = E2 + C1 in the definition of M7. However, we choose to avoid the (2)-ruling - K7 for technical reasons.

A rescaling [formula] is good if and only if it embeds [formula] into [formula].

As [formula], a good rescaling φr satisfies [formula]. Conversely, we have

[formula]

by Lemma [\ref=lem:homspace_degree3] and Lemma [\ref=lem:homspace_degree2]. Taking the closure and using that Hr is closed and that [formula] is irreducible by [\cite=MR2029863], we conclude that [formula], so the rescaling is good.

As in Section [\ref=sec:del_pezzo], let Jr be the ideal defining [formula] in [formula].

In terms of the coordinate rings [formula] and [formula] and in view of the previous lemma, a rescaling φr is good if, for all D∈Mr, the ideal [formula] contains φ*r(pD), where pD is the equation defining Hr corresponding to the (1)-ruling D.

As [formula] and [formula] are both graded by [formula] and φ*r respects this grading, we need rescaling factors such that φ*r(pD) of degree D∈Mr is a linear combination of the equations [formula]. For concrete calculations in the next sections, we describe this more explicitly:

Let D∈Mr be a (1)-ruling, which can be written in r - 1 ways as the sum of two ( - 1)-curves Ei',Ei''. For [formula], let

[formula]

Then pD has the form

[formula]

with εi∈{  ±  1}.

As ξi vanishes exactly on [formula], the 2-dimensional space H0(Sr,O(D)) is generated by any two ξi, ξi'. Hence, all other r - 3 elements ξj are linear combinations of ξi, ξi', with non-vanishing coefficients. This gives r - 3 relations of degree D in [formula]. Rearranging [formula] such that the two elements ξi, ξi' of our choice have the indices r - 2 and r - 1, we can write them as

[formula]

for [formula], where [formula].

Suppose that φ*r(pD) is a linear combination of the FD,j with factors λj:

[formula]

Since φ*r(ξ'(E))  =  ξ''(E)  ·  ξ(E), we have φ*r(ξi')  =  ξi''  ·  ξi for the monomials of degree 2. Then the above equation is equivalent to the vanishing of

[formula]

For [formula], we see by considering the coefficients of ξi that we must choose λi  =  εiξi''. With this, consideration of the coefficients of ξr - 2 and ξr - 1 results in the following conditions gD,1, gD,2 on the rescaling factors ξj'', which are homogeneous of degree [formula]:

[formula]

Note that our choice of ξr - 2 and ξr - 1 in the definition of FD,j as discussed before [\eqref=eq:defining_FDj] is reflected here in the sense that gD,1 and gD,2 express the corresponding ξ''r - 2 and ξ''r - 1 as linear combinations of [formula] with non-zero coefficients.

This information can be summarized as follows:

For r∈{6,7}, a rescaling is good if and only if the rescaling factors ξ''(E) fulfill the equations gD,1 and gD,2 for each (1)-ruling D∈Mr.

As described above precisely, the non-zero coefficients εi are taken from the equations pD [\eqref=eq:defining_Hr] defining Hr, and the non-zero αj, βj are taken from the equations FD,j [\eqref=eq:defining_FDj] defining [formula].

Let Ξ''(E)k (resp. Ξ''(E)> k) be the set of all ξ''(E') for E'∈N(E)k (resp. E'∈N(E)> k). Let

[formula]

We claim that we may express the rescaling factors [formula] in terms of the other Nr - 2 + 2 rescaling factors [formula].

We will prove this for r∈{6,7} as follows: The 2  ·  (Nr - Nr - 1 - 1) equations gD,i are homogeneous of degree D with respect to the [formula]-grading of the variables ξ''(E), and we are interested only in the solutions where all ξ''(E) are non-zero. Because of the action of [formula] on the rescaling factors and as [formula] are part of a basis of [formula], we may assume [formula].

Consider a (1)-ruling D = E1 + E such that (E2,E) = 0. Then

[formula]

are the r - 1 possibilities to write D as the sum of two intersecting ( - 1)-curves. Here, [formula]. As in the discussion before Lemma [\ref=lem:equations], we may set up the equations FD,j such that gD,1 and gD,2 express ξ''(E) and ξ''(E') directly as a linear combination of ξ''(E'i)ξ''(E''i). This expresses all ξ(E)∈Ξ'',10 and all ξ''(E')∈Ξ'',01 in terms of variables in Ξ'',00.

For a (1)-ruling D = E1 + E such that (E2,E) = 1, we have

[formula]

where we may assume (E2,E'i) = 0 and (E2,E''i) = 1. Since (E1,E'i) = (E1,E''i) = 0, we have ξ''(E'i)∈Ξ'',00 and ξ''(E''i)∈Ξ'',01. Using the previous findings to express ξ''(E''i) in terms of variables Ξ'',00, the equation gD,1 results in a condition on the variables Ξ'',00, while gD,2 expresses ξ''(E)∈Ξ'',11 in terms of these variables.

In the case r = 7, the equation gD,2 for D = E1 + C2 expresses λ''2∈Ξ'',12 in terms of variables in Ξ'',01, and gD,1 gives a further condition on these variables. Furthermore, gD,2 for the (1)-ruling D = E2 + C1 expresses λ''1∈Ξ'',21 in terms of Ξ'',10, while gD,1 gives a further condition on them. Substituting the expressions for Ξ'',01 respectively Ξ'',10 in terms of Ξ'',00, we get expressions for λ''2 and λ''1, while the gD,1 result in further condition on Ξ'',00.

We summarize this in the following lemma. For its proof, it remains to show in the following sections that the expressions for [formula] are non-zero, and that the further conditions vanish.

We can write the Nr - Nr - 2 - 2 rescaling factors in the set [formula] as non-zero expressions in terms of Nr - 2 + 2 rescaling factors [formula]. With this, the Nr - 2Nr - 1 + Nr - 2 further conditions on the rescaling factors are trivial.

For an open subset of the Nr - 2 + 2 parameters [formula], all rescaling factors are non-zero, so we obtain good rescalings, which proves Theorem [\ref=thm:main] once the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:factors] is completed.

Degree 3

In this section, we prove Lemma [\ref=lem:factors] for r = 6 by solving the system of equations on the rescaling factors of Lemma [\ref=lem:equations]: For each (1)-ruling D∈M6, we determine the coefficients of the equation pD defining H6 as in [\eqref=eq:defining_Hr], and find the coefficients αj,βj of FD,j defining [formula] as in [\eqref=eq:defining_FDj] in the list in [\cite=math.AG/0603111]. This allows us to write down the 20 equations gD,i on the rescaling factors ξ''(E) explicitly. Let

[formula]

for simplicity.

[formula]

As explained in the previous section, we may assume [formula].

Recall the discussion before the definition [\eqref=eq:defining_FDj] of FD,j and before Lemma [\ref=lem:equations]. If we had chosen ξ4  =  ηiλ1 and ξ5  =  η1λi when writing down the equations FE1 + Qi,j in [\cite=math.AG/0603111], then the resulting gE1 + Qi,2 would give λ''i directly as a quadratic expression in terms of μ''j,k. Furthermore, each of the five gE1 + Qi,1 would express λ''1 as a quadratic equation in μ''j,k. Of course, we get the same result by solving the equivalent system of equations gE1 + Qi,j as listed above.

The equations gE1 + m1,i,j for [formula] and gE1 + Q2,j allow us to express the variables μ''1,i, λ''2 in Ξ'',10 and μ''2,i, λ''1 in Ξ'',01 in terms of the six variables [formula]. (As we have set the remaining elements [formula] of Ξ'',00 to the value 1, they do not occur in these expressions.)

With γ3: = d(a - c)(1 - b) - c(b - d)(1 - a), we obtain:

[formula]

For [formula], we consider the remaining equations gE1 + E,i. We can use gE1 + E,2 and substitution of our previous results in order to express ξ''(E)∈Ξ'',11 in terms of Ξ'',00:

Finally, we check by substituting and expanding that the five further conditions gE1 + E,1 are trivial.

Using the restrictions on a, b, c, d imposed by the fact that [formula] are in general position (e.g., a must be different from b and c, and all are neither 0 nor 1), we see that [formula] are non-zero polynomials in [formula]. Therefore, for an open subset of the N4 + 2 = 12 parameters [formula], all rescaling factors are non-zero, resulting in good rescalings.

Degree 2

For the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:factors] for r = 7, we proceed as in the case r = 6 and assume [formula].

Let D: = D(1)i∈M7 for [formula]. We can arrange [formula] in such a way that gD,1 and gD,2 express μ''1,i and μ''2,i in terms of μ''i,j for [formula] (see the discussion before Lemma [\ref=lem:equations]). Similarly, for [formula] and D: = D(2)1,2,i∈M7, we can arrange gD,1 and gD,2 such that they express ν''1,i and ν''2,i linearly in ν''1,2 and of degree 2 in [formula]. This expresses all variables in [formula] in terms of Ξ'',00.

Substituting this into an appropriately arranged gD,2 for D: = D(1)2∈M7 gives μ''1,2∈Ξ'',11 in terms of [formula], and we check that gD,1 becomes trivial.

Now, let D: = D(2)1,i,j∈M7 for [formula]. We arrange gD,1 and gD,2 such that they express ν''1,i respectively ν''i,j in terms of ν''1,j and expressions of degree 2 in μ''k,l. Using our previous findings, the first expression turns out trivial, and the second one gives ν''i,j∈Ξ'',11 in terms of [formula].

Finally, let [formula]. We arrange gD,1 and gD,2 such that the first one is an expression in μ''j,k and ν''j,k which becomes trivial. The second one expresses λ''i in terms of μ''j,k and ν''j,k, and we substitute again our previous results.

This completes the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:factors] and thus Theorem [\ref=thm:main]. In total, we obtain good rescalings for an open subset of a system N5 + 2 = 18 parameters

[formula]

Since it is straightforward to determine the exact expressions for the remaining 38 rescaling factors in terms of these parameters, and since the expressions are rather long, we choose not to list them here.

In principle, it would be possible to consider the conditions gD,i for all (1)-rulings without reducing to the subset Mr as we did in Section [\ref=sec:homogeneous_spaces]. While this is doable in degree 3 with some software help (Magma), especially the expressions corresponding to the (1)-ruling D(5)i in degree 2 seem to be out of reach for direct computations. Furthermore, we would have to embed the relations vii corresponding to the (2)-ruling - K7, which causes further complications.

For r∈{5,6,7}, there is a (Nr - 2 - r + 1)-parameter family of images of [formula] under good embeddings in Hr by Remark [\ref=rem:parameters]. The dimension of [formula] is r + 3, and there is a (2  ·  (r - 4))-parameter family of smooth Del Pezzo surfaces Sr of degree 9 - r. The dimension of Hr is Nr - 1 + 1.

In fact, [\cite=popov_diplom] shows that the closure of the union of all these images for all Del Pezzo surfaces of degree 4 equals H5.

For r = 6, by comparing the dimensions and numbers of parameters, a similar result seems possible. However, for r = 7, we have

[formula]

while H7 has dimension Nr - 1 + 1 = 28. Consequently, the closure of the union of the corresponding images, over all Del Pezzo surfaces of degree 2, under all good embeddings cannot be H7 for dimension reasons.
