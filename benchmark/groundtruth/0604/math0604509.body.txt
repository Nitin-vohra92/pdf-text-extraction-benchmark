Introduction

Let [formula] be a domain. Let {fj} be a sequence of holomorphic self-maps of D. Let [formula]. The sequence {Fj} is called the holomorphic iterated function system (associated to {fj}). Such systems are encountered naturally in dynamical systems, continued fraction theory and other areas of complex analysis. Given a holomorphic iterated function system, one is interested in knowing its asymptotical behavior, namely, to know the possible limits (in the compact-open topology for instance) of the sequence. In general such a question is rather difficult and one contents to know which conditions guarantee that every limit of {Fj} is constant (we refer the reader to the papers [\cite=BCMN] and [\cite=Ke-La] and bibliography therein).

More in detail, let X  ⊂  D be a subset of D. We say that the set X is degenerate in D if all the limits of any holomorphic iterated function system {Fj} for which fj:D  →  X are constant.

In case [formula], degenerate subdomains are completely characterized in terms of hyperbolic distance by Beardon, Carne, Minda and Ng [\cite=BCMN] and Keen and Lakic [\cite=Ke-La]. To state their results, we first introduce some terminology, as needed for our later aims.

We denote by kD the Kobayashi distance of D and by κD the corresponding Kobayashi infinitesimal metric (for definition and properties we refer to [\cite=Ko]). Notice that for [formula] then [formula] is nothing but the usual Poincaré distance.

Let X  ⊂  D. Let us denote by R(X) its Bloch radius, namely

[formula]

where BD(w,r) = {w∈D:kD(w,z) < r} is a Kobayashi ball of center z∈D and radius r > 0. A subset X  ⊂  D is a Bloch subset of D if R(X) <  +   ∞  .

Let now Z  ⊆  D be a subdomain of D. Then κZ(z;v)  ≥  κD(z;v) for all z∈Z and v∈TzZ. The hyperbolic Lipschitz constant of Z is defined as

[formula]

The subdomain Z is called a Lipschitz subdomain of D is μD(Z) < 1.

In [\cite=BCMN] Beardon, Carne, Minda and Ng proved the following result:

In [\cite=Ke-La] Keen and Lakic showed that also the converse of (2) holds:

Thus the theorems of Beardon, Carne, Minda and Ng and of Keen and Lakic completely characterize geometrically degenerate subdomains of [formula].

In higher dimension the story is different. In [\cite=BCMN] it is in fact also proved:

However, as Beardon, Carne, Minda and Ng show, Bloch domains are not necessarily Lipschitz domains in several dimensions, and the question of characterizing in a geometric flavor both Lipschitz and degenerate subdomains of bounded domains in higher dimension is open.

The aim of the present note is to present a Bloch-type property that guarantees a subset (not just an open subdomain) of a bounded convex domain to be degenerate. To motivate our definitions and results, we first look at the following example:

The previous example suggests that degenerate properties of a subset should be related to Blochness properties of the intersection of that subset with suitably chosen analytic discs. In order to make this argument work (and to choose the right discs) we briefly recall how a Lempert projection device is defined (see [\cite=Le], [\cite=Abate] and [\cite=Ko] for further details).

Let D be a bounded convex domain in [formula] and let z0∈D. Given any point z∈D there exists a complex geodesic [formula], i.e., a holomorphic isometry between [formula] and kD, such that φ(0) = z0 and φ(t) = z for some t∈(0,1). A complex geodesic is also an infinitesimal isometry between the Poincaré metric and the Kobayashi metric, and, given any point z∈D and nonzero direction v∈TzD there exists a complex geodesic containing z and tangent to v at z.

Moreover for any such a complex geodesic there exists a holomorphic retraction [formula] with affine fibers, i.e. [formula] is a holomorphic self-map of D such that [formula], [formula] for any [formula] and [formula] is the intersection of D with a complex hyperplane for all [formula]. We call such a [formula] a Lempert projection associated to φ. We remark that if D is convex but not strongly convex then [formula] is not unique in general. For instance in the bidisc [formula] the complex geodesic [formula] has several Lempert projections such as ρ1(z,w) = (z,z) and [formula]. However, if D is strongly convex then the Lempert projection (that is the one with affine fibers) is unique (see [\cite=BPT]).

Furthermore we let [formula] and call it the left inverse of φ, for [formula]. The triple [formula] is a so-called Lempert projection device.

For [formula] the unit ball of [formula] the image of the complex geodesic through the points [formula] is just the one dimensional slice [formula]. The Lempert projection is thus given by the orthogonal projection of [formula] onto Sz,w.

Let [formula] be a bounded convex domain. We say that a subset X  ⊂  D is 1-Bloch in D if there exists C > 0 such that for any Lempert projection device [formula] the subset [formula] is contained in a Bloch subdomain [formula] of [formula] with Bloch radius [formula].

The main result of this note is:

The proof of Theorem [\ref=main1] is contained in section two. Such a proof does not rely on any Lipschitzian property of 1-Bloch subsets but, as we show in section three, a 1-Bloch subdomain of D is necessarily Lipschitz in D (so that, in case X is a subdomain, Theorem [\ref=main1] follows also from Theorem [\ref=Ng2]). In section three we also discuss of another natural Blochness condition which is implied by the Lipschitz condition for subdomains, giving some geometric hints on what a Lipschitz subdomain in several complex variables looks like.

Bloch, 1-Bloch and degenerate subsets

In all the present section D is bounded convex domain in [formula] and X  ⊂  D denotes a subset of D. We begin with the following simple observation:

Let BD(z0,r) be any Kobayashi ball contained in X. Then for any complex geodesic [formula] such that φ(0) = z0 it follows that [formula] and therefore [formula] contains the hyperbolic disc [formula]. Since [formula] then [formula] contains the hyperbolic disc [formula]. Hence the Bloch radius of any domain in D containing [formula] must be greater than or equal to r. Since by the very definition there exists a domain [formula] containing [formula] with Bloch radius ≤  C, it follows that r  ≤  C and hence X has Bloch radius ≤  C, and it is a Bloch subset of D.

Notice that Example [\ref=esempio] shows that the converse of Proposition [\ref=chara] is false in general.

In order to prove Theorem [\ref=main1] we need a preliminary fact, quite interesting by its own. First, we recall the following lemma [\cite=BCMN]

Then we have

By Theorem [\ref=Ng] there exists c < 1 such that the hyperbolic Lipschitz constant μ(Wj) < c for all j. By Lemma [\ref=lemmaBMCN] it follows that [formula] for all [formula] and [formula]. Thus the sequence {gj} is strictly decreasing with respect to [formula] with uniform constant c < 1 and our statement follows from a Contraction Mapping Theorem (see, [\cite=BCMN]).

Now we can prove Theorem [\ref=main1].

Let {fj} be a sequence of holomorphic self-maps of D with image contained in X. Let F be a limit of the associated holomorphic iterated system {Fj} (where [formula]). Up to relabeling we can assume that {Fj} converges to F. Assume that F is not constant and that F(z)  ≠  F(w) for some z,w∈D. Let [formula] be a complex geodesic such that φ1(0) = z and φ1(t1) = w for some 0 < t1 < 1. Let [formula] for j  ≥  2 be a complex geodesic defined by induction as follows: [formula] and [formula] for some 0 < tj < 1. Let [formula]. Then [formula] is holomorphic. By construction [formula] while [formula]. Now, the family {φj} is a normal family in D. Let [formula] be one of its limit. By continuity of the Kobayashi distance it follows that either φ is a complex geodesic or [formula]. Since φj(0) = Fj - 1(z)  →  F(z) as j  →    ∞  , it follows that φ is in fact a complex geodesic. Moreover, since φj(tj) = Fj(w)  →  F(w) as j  →    ∞  , it follows that there exists t∈(0,1) such that tj  →  t as j  →    ∞   and φ(t) = F(w). Up to re-labelling, we can assume that φ is the only limit of {φj}.

Next, we claim that the Lempert projections {ρφj} converge (up to subsequences) in the compact-open topology of D to a Lempert projection [formula] (showing that [formula] converges to [formula]). To see this, let ρ be any limit of the normal family {ρφj}. Again, up to re-labeling, we can assume that ρ is the only limit. First we notice that, since ρφj(φj(ζ)) = φj(ζ) for all [formula] and [formula], it follows that ρ(φ(ζ)) = φ(ζ) for all [formula]. Thus, in particular, ρ(D)  ⊂  D and, since [formula] for any j, it follows that [formula]. Now we claim that [formula]. We already know that [formula]. Let ρ(z)∈ρ(D). Then there exists a sequence {zj}  ⊂  D such that ρj(zj)  →  ρ(z) as j  →    ∞  . But ρj(zj) = φj(ζj) for some [formula] and [formula]. Thus φj(ζj)  →  φ(ζ) = ρ(z) and hence [formula]. Finally, it is clear that the fibers of ρ are to be affine for those of every ρφj are. Hence ρ is a Lempert projection associated to φ.

As a result, if g is any limit of the holomorphic iterated function system {gj} it follows that [formula] and [formula]. Hence the holomorphic iterated function system {gj} has a non-constant limit. However, by the very definition of 1-Bloch, [formula] with [formula] where Uj is a Bloch domain in [formula] with Bloch radius bounded from above by some C > 0 independently of j. This contradicts Proposition [\ref=unioneBloch] and we are done.

c-Bloch, 1-Bloch and Lipschitz subdomains

In all the present section D is a bounded convex domain in [formula] and X  ⊂  D denotes a subdomain of D.

The subdomain X  ⊂  D is c-Bloch if there exists C > 0 such that for every Lempert projection device [formula] the (possibly empty) open set [formula] is contained in a Bloch subdomain of [formula] with Bloch radius bounded from above by C.

By the very definition we have

The converse is however false in general as the following example shows:

We have the following relations among 1-Bloch, c-Bloch and Lipschitz subdomain

(1) Let [formula] be a complex geodesic such that [formula]. The set [formula] is a (not necessarily connected) domain in [formula]. Since [formula] is holomorphic, by the monotonicity of the Kobayashi metric [formula] for all [formula] and [formula]. Hence for all [formula] we have

[formula]

for some c < 1 independent of φ (because X is Lipschitz in D by hypothesis). Thus [formula] is Lipschitz in [formula] and by Theorem [\ref=Ng].(1) it is a Bloch subdomain of [formula] with Bloch radius bounded from above by 2 tanh - 1c. Hence X is c-Bloch.

(2) Assume that X is 1-Bloch. This means that there exists a constant C > 0 such that for all Lempert projection devices [formula] it follows that the Bloch radius of [formula] is less than or equal to C. In particular by Theorem [\ref=Ng].(1), the (possibly empty) open set [formula] is a Lipschitz subdomain of [formula] with hyperbolic Lipschitz constant bounded from above by c =  tanh C.

Fix z∈X and [formula]. Let [formula] be a complex geodesic such that φ(0) = z and dφ0(ξ) = v for some [formula]. Let [formula] be the left inverse of φ. By the monotonicity of the Kobayashi metric, considering the holomorphic map [formula] and since [formula], we have

[formula]

Therefore, taking into account that [formula], it follows

[formula]

proving that X is Lipschitz in D.

Proposition [\ref=main2] gives a geometric necessary condition (c-Blochness) for a subdomain to be Lipschitz, and then degenerate. Such a condition is rather easy to be verified in simple domains such as the unit ball [formula] of [formula]. We do not know whether such a condition is also sufficient, namely, it is an open question if c-Bloch implies Lipschitz.
