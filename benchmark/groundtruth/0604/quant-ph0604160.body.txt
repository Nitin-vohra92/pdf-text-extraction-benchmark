Abstract

We put forward an alternative approach to the SLOCC classification of entanglement states of three-qubit and four-qubit systems. By directly solving matrix equations, we obtain the relations satisfied by the amplitudes of states. The relations are readily tested since in them only addition, subtraction and multiplication occur.

Introduction

Entanglement plays a key role in quantum computing and quantum information theory. One of the interesting issues on entanglement is how to define the equivalence of two entangled states. If two states can be obtained from each other by means of local operations and classical communication (LOCC) with nonzero probability, we say that two states have the same kind of entanglement[\cite=Bennett]. It is well known that a pure entangled state of two-qubits can be locally transformed into a EPR state. For multipartite systems, there are several inequivalent forms of entanglement under asymptotic LOCC[\cite=Bennett2]. Recently, many authors investigated the equivalence classes of three-qubit states specified by stochastic local operations and classical communication (SLOCC)[\cite=Acin]-  [\cite=Pan]. Dür et al showed that for pure states of three-qubits there are total six different classes of the entanglement and out of the six classes, there are two inequivalent types of genuine tripartite entanglement[\cite=Dur]. They put forward a principled method to distinguish the six classes from each other by calculating the ranks of the reduced density matrices and the minimal product decomposition[\cite=Dur]. For example, they pointed out that if a state of a three-qubit system with r(ρA) = r(ρB) = r(ρC) = 2 has 2 (resp. 3) product terms in its minimal product decomposition under SLOCC, then the state is equivalent to |GHZ〉 (resp. |W〉). However, so far no criterion is proposed for the minimal number of product decomposition terms under SLOCC[\cite=Acin][\cite=Dur][\cite=Sampera]. In a more recent paper, Verstraete et al[\cite=Moor2] considered the entanglement class of four-qubits under SLOCC and concluded that there exist nine families of states corresponding to nine different ways of entanglement. In these previous papers, the authors just put forward some principled rules of classifying the entangled states. It needs complicated calculations when these principled rules is used to real states. It will be quite useful if a feasible approach can be found. Here, we present an alternative approach to classify the entanglement of three-qubits, and then generalize the case of four-qubits. We will give simple criteria of distinguishing the entanglement classes from each other simply by checking the relations satisfied by the amplitudes of the states.

Classification of entanglement for a three-qubit system

We first discuss the system comprising three qubits A, B, C. The states of a three-qubit system can be generally expressed as

[formula]

Two states |ψ〉 and [formula], are equivalent under SLOCC if and only if there exist invertible local operators α,β and γ such that

[formula]

where the local operators α,β and γ can be expressed as 2  ×  2 invertible matrices

[formula]

We consider the following six classes, respectively.

The class equivalent to the state |GHZ〉

Let [formula], i.e.

[formula]

Substituting Eq. ([\ref=ghz]) into Eq. ([\ref=psi']), we get

[formula]

By calculating aiaj - akal, where i + j = k + l and [formula], where [formula] is addition modulo two, we obtain the following equations:

[formula]

By using the above equations, we further obtain

[formula]

|ψ〉 is equivalent to |GHZ〉 under SLOCC, if and only if the invertible operators α,β and γ exist. From Eq. ([\ref=ghz2]), we may immediately conclude that the necessary and sufficient condition of |ψ〉 being equivalent to |GHZ〉 is

[formula]

It is not hard to verify that

[formula]

Therefore the above condition ([\ref=ghz3]) can be replaced by the following any one of the following conditions.

[formula]

The class equivalent to the state |W〉

Let [formula], i.e.

[formula]

Substituting Eq. ([\ref=w1]) into Eq. ([\ref=psi']), we get

[formula]

By calculating aiaj - akal, where i + j = k + l and [formula], we have

[formula]

By using the above equations, we can conclude that ψ〉 is equivalent to |W〉 under SLOCC if and only if ai satisfy the following equation

[formula]

and inequalities

[formula]

Notice that from ([\ref=ghz4]) Eq. ([\ref=w2]) can be replaced by any one of the following equations.

[formula]

A-BC class

If |ψ〉 belongs to A-BC class, then |ψ〉 can be written as |ψ〉 = (s|0〉A + t|1〉A)(a|00〉BC + b|01〉BC + c|10〉BC + d|11〉BC), where bc  ≠  ad since systems B and C are entangled. Thus we obtain the following equations.

[formula]

By using the equations ([\ref=c2]) and bc  ≠  ad, we can obtain the following equalities and inequalities,

[formula]

It is clear that the relations in Eq. ([\ref=c1]) are the necessary condition of |ψ〉 being equivalent to the class A-BC. Conversely, we can show that this criterion is sufficient too. To this end, let [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula]. For the real number case, we can see that the above amplitude equations in ([\ref=c2]) hold true under the equalities in ([\ref=c1]). For example, a2s2 = (a20 + a24)(a20 + a21 + a22 + a23) = a20(a20 + a21 + a22 + a23) + a20a24 + a21a24 + a22a24 + a23a24 = a20(a20 + a21 + a22 + a23 + a24 + a25 + a26 + a27) = a20. These amplitude equations imply that |ψ〉 = (s|0〉A + t|1〉A)(a|00〉BC + b|01〉BC + c|10〉BC + d|11〉BC). This case can be extended to the complex case.

Next we show that systems B and C are entangled. From the amplitude equations ([\ref=c2]) we can obtain that bcs2 = a1a2, ads2 = a0a3, bct2 = a5a6 and adt2 = a4a7. Further from the inequalities of this criterion, it is easy to derive that bcs2  ≠  ads2 or bct2  ≠  adt2. Since at least one of s and t is not zero, then bc  ≠  ad, which means that systems B and C are entangled.

We arrive at the conclusion that |ψ〉 belongs to the A-BC class if and only if ai satisfy the equalities and inequalities given in Eq. ([\ref=c1]).

Notice that it can be verified by using ([\ref=c2]) that ([\ref=w2]) also holds for A - BC class.

B-AC class

Similarly, we can show that |ψ〉 belongs to this class if and only if ai satisfy the following equalities and inequalities:

[formula]

The proof is similar to the one for class A - BC.

Notice that ([\ref=w2]) also holds for B - AC class.

C-AB class

|ψ〉 belongs to the class C-AB, if and only if ai satisfy the following equalities and inequalities:

[formula]

The proof is similar to the one for class A - BC.

Notice that ([\ref=w2]) also holds for C - AB class.

A - B - C class

If the state |ψ〉 belongs to the class A-B-C, the necessary and sufficient condition[\cite=LDF] reads

[formula]

Notice that it is easy to see from ([\ref=f1]) that ([\ref=w2]) holds.

The complete partition

Before proceeding further, we would like to point out that the criteria for classes A - B - C, A - BC, B - AC, C - AB, |GHZ〉 and |W〉 are exclusive to each other ( see Appendix A for the details). The criteria form a complete partition (see table 1 for the details). For this completeness, what we need to do next is to demonstrate the "not-occur" cases and the alternate criteria for A - BC, B - AC, C - AB, A - B - C in table 1. We finish these proofs in appendixes B, C and D respectively. Thus we argue that any state has to be in one of classes A - B - C, A - BC, B - AC, C - AB, |GHZ〉 and |W〉 and any two states satisfying the same criterion are related by SLOCC. In other words, we give a different proof of Dür et al.'s SLOCC classification.

The table 1: The complete partition

In the table 1, "Y" means that the condition holds and "N" means that the condition does not hold. "not-occur" means the case does not occur.

Classification of entanglement for a four-qubit system

We now turn the discussion to four-qubit systems. By means of the criteria for SLOCC entanglement classes of three-qubits, we can derive the criteria for degenerated four-qubit entanglement. We give the necessary criteria which the four-qubit |GHZ〉 and |W〉 classes satisfy. Let [formula]. We argue that |C4〉 is a genuinely four-qubit entangled state which is inequivalent to |GHZ〉 or |W〉 states of four-qubits under SLOCC.

Let |ψ〉 [formula] be any pure state of four-qubits.

Three-qubit GHZ entanglement accompanied with a separable one qubit

We only study that ABC are GHZ -  entangled. Let |ψ〉 = |φ〉ABC(s|0〉 + t|1〉)D, where[formula] and |φ〉 is in |GHZ〉 class of three-qubits. By the criterion for |GHZ〉 class of three-qubits, we have the following inequality,

(b0b7 - b2b5 + (b1b6 - b3b4))2  ≠  4(b2b4 - b0b6)(b3b5 - b1b7).

Since γ  ≠  0 or δ  ≠  0,

γ4  ≠  0 or

δ4  ≠  0.

Consequently, ai satisfy the following inequalities:

(a0a14 - a4a10 + a2a12 - a6a8)2  ≠  4(a4a8 - a0a12)(a6a10 - a2a14) or

(a1a15 - a5a11 + a3a13 - a7a9)2  ≠  4(a5a9 - a1a13)(a7a11 - a3a15)

and the following equalities:

aiaj = akal, where aiaj - akal are all the 2  ×  2 minor determinants of the following matrix,

[formula]a&a&a&a&a&a&a&a[formula]a&a&a&a&a&a&a&a[formula].

These conditions are necessary and sufficient.

Example, [formula] satisfies the above conditions.

Three-qubit W entanglement accompanied with a separable one qubit

We only illustrate that ABC are W -  entangled. Let |ψ〉 = |φ〉ABC(s|0〉 + t|1〉)D, where[formula] and |φ〉 is in |W〉 class of three-qubits. By means of the criterion for |W〉 class of three-qubits, ai satisfy the following equalities:

(a0a14 - a4a10 + a2a12 - a6a8)2 = 4(a4a8 - a0a12)(a6a10 - a2a14),

(a1a15 - a5a11 + a3a13 - a7a9)2 = 4(a5a9 - a1a13)(a7a11 - a3a15),

aiaj = akal, where aiaj - akal are all the 2  ×  2 minor determinants of the following matrix,

[formula]a&a&a&a&a&a&a&a[formula]a&a&a&a&a&a&a&a[formula]

and satisfy the following inequalities:

[formula] [formula] [formula]

[formula] [formula] [formula]

[formula] [formula] [formula].

These conditions are necessary and sufficient.

For example, [formula] and [formula] satisfy the above conditions.

A state consisting of two EPR pairs

We only investigate AB - CD class, where AB and CD are EPR pairs, as follows. |ψ〉 is in this class if and only if ai satisfy the following inequalities

[formula]

[formula]

and the following equalities:

aiaj = akal, where aiaj - akal are all the 2  ×  2 minor determinants of the following matrix,

[formula]a&a&a&a[formula]a&a&a&a[formula]a&a&a&a[formula]a&a&a&a[formula].

Example, |φ4〉, which is (|0000〉 + |0011〉 + |1100〉 - |1111〉) / 2 in [\cite=Briegel], does not satisfy the above conditions.

Only two qubits are entangled

We only discuss A - B - CD class where CD is a EPR pair. Then one can obtain that |ψ〉 is in this class if and only if ai satisfy the following inequalities

[formula]

and the following equalities

aiaj = akal, where i + j = k + l and [formula], i < j, k < l, i = l (mod4), j = k (mod4).

A-B-C-D class

|ψ〉 is separable if and only if aiaj = akal, where i + j = k + l and [formula].

|GHZ〉 class

Let [formula]. Then if |ψ〉 is equivalent to |GHZ〉 under SLOCC then ai satisfy the following inequality,

a2a13 - a3a12 + (a4a11 - a5a10)  ≠  (a0a15 - a1a14) + (a6a9 - a7a8)

and the following equalities,

(a1a4 - a0a5)(a11a14 - a10a15) = (a3a6 - a2a7)(a9a12 - a8a13),

(a4a7 - a5a6)(a8a11 - a9a10) = (a0a3 - a1a2)(a12a15 - a13a14),

[formula].

For example, |GHZ〉 satisfies the above conditions, while |φ4〉[\cite=Briegel] does not satisfy the second equality of this criterion. Thus, we also show that |φ4〉 is not in the four-qubit GHZ entanglement class.

|W〉 class

Let |W〉  =   (|0001〉 + |0010〉 + |0100〉 + |1000) / 2. Then if |ψ〉 is equivalent to |W〉 under SLOCC then ai satisfy the following equalities

a2a13 - a3a12 + a4a11  -   a5a10 = a0a15  -   a1a14 + a6a9 - a7a8

((a0a7 - a3a4) + (a1a6 - a2a5))2 = 4(a3a5 - a1a7)(a2a4 - a0a6),

((a4a11 - a7a8) + (a5a10 - a6a9))2 = 4(a7a9 - a5a11)(a6a8 - a4a10),

((a8a15 - a11a12) + (a9a14 - a10a13))2 = 4(a11a13 - a9a15)(a10a12 - a8a14),

(a0a14 - a4a10 + a2a12 - a6a8)2 = 4(a4a8 - a0a12)(a6a10 - a2a14)

(a1a15 - a5a11 + a3a13 - a7a9)2 = 4(a5a9 - a1a13)(a7a11 - a3a15)

(a0a11 - a2a9 + a1a10 - a3a8)2 = 4(a2a8 - a0a10)(a3a9 - a1a11)

(a4a15 - a6a13 + a5a14 - a7a12)2 = 4(a6a12 - a4a14)(a7a13 - a5a15)

(a0a13 - a4a9 + a1a12 - a5a8)2 = 4(a4a8 - a0a12)(a5a9 - a1a13)

(a2a15 - a6a11 + a3a14 - a7a10)2 = 4(a6a10 - a2a14)(a7a11 - a3a15)

(a1a4 - a0a5)(a11a14 - a10a15) = (a3a6 - a2a7)(a9a12 - a8a13),

(a4a7 - a5a6)(a8a11 - a9a10) = (a0a3 - a1a2)(a12a15 - a13a14),

(a3a5 - a1a7)(a10a12 - a8a14) = (a2a4 - a0a6)(a11a13 - a9a15),

and the following inequalities

a0a3  ≠   a1a2 or a5a6  ≠   a4a7 or a8a11  ≠   a9a10 or a13a14  ≠   a12a15,

a1a4  ≠   a0a5 or a3a6  ≠  a2a7 or a9a12  ≠   a8a13 or a11a14  ≠   a10a15,

and a3a5  ≠  a1a7 or a2a4  ≠   a0a6 or a11a13  ≠   a9a15 or a10a12  ≠   a8a14.

The proof is in appendix E.

Example, |W〉 satisfies the above conditions, while |φ4〉 does not satisfy this criterion.

A genuinely four-qubit entanglement |C4〉 class

It is easy to verify that |C4〉 does not satisfy the criteria for degenerated four-qubit entanglement. It means that |C4〉 is a genuinely four-qubit entangled state. We can also observe that |C4〉 does not satisfy the first equality of the criteria for |GHZ〉 or |W〉 classes. Therefore, |C4〉 is inequivalent to |GHZ〉 or |W〉 under SLOCC.

|C4〉 possesses the following properties.

(1).|C4〉 is symmetric under permutation of parties.

(2).|C4〉 is self-complementary in the following sense.

Let [formula] ( [formula] ) be the complement of a bit 1 (0). Then [formula] = 1 and  = 0. Let   =  ... denote the complement of a binary string z = z1z2....zn. Likewise, we can define [formula] + c1|〉 [formula], where |Φ〉 = c0|0〉 + c1|1〉 + .... + c2n - 1|2n - 1〉, and call [formula] the complement of |Φ〉. Obviously, [formula].

(3). When any one of the four qubits is traced out, the remaining three qubits are identical and mixed. For example, [formula], where |W〉 is [formula].

(4). When any two of the four qubits are traced out, the remaining two qubits are identical and mixed. For example, [formula], where [formula].

Summaries

In summaries, in this paper we propose the simple criteria, in which only addition and multiplication occur, for the SLOCC equivalence classes and show that these criteria are exclusive and form a complete partition. Thus, new proofs are given for Dür et al.'s SLOCC classification of three-qubits. By means of the criteria for SLOCC entanglement classes of three-qubits, we can derive the criteria for degenerated four-qubit entanglement. We obtain the necessary criteria which the four-qubit |GHZ〉 and |W〉 classes satisfy. We observe that |C4〉 is a genuinely four-qubit entangled state which is inequivalent to |GHZ〉 or |W〉 states of four-qubits under SLOCC. By means of the criteria of four-qubits, we can determine if a state is a genuinely four-qubit entangled state which is inequivalent to |GHZ〉 or |W〉 under SLOCC.

Appendix A

Proof.

Case 1. The criteria for |GHZ〉 and |W〉 classes are exclusive.

This is because the criterion for |GHZ〉 class contradicts condition (1) of the criterion for |W〉 class.

Case 2. The criteria for class |W〉 and for any one of classes A - B - C , A - BC, B - AC and C - AB are exclusive.

Condition (2) of the criterion for |W〉 class implies that the criteria for |W〉 class and A - B - C class are exclusive.

In A - BC class, any state satisfies a1a4 = a0a5 and a3a6 = a2a7. However, condition (2) of the criterion for |W〉 class says that a1a4  ≠   a0a5 or a3a6  ≠  a2a7. Therefore the criteria for |W〉 class and A - BC class are exclusive.

Similarly, the criteria for classes |W〉 and B - AC and for classes |W〉 and C - AB are exclusive, respectively.

Case 3. The criteria for class |GHZ〉 and for any one of classes A - B - C , A - BC, B - AC and C - AB are exclusive.

First let us demonstrate that the criteria for classes |GHZ〉 and A - B - C are exclusive. We see immediately that any state in A - B - C class does not satisfy the criteria for |GHZ〉 class. Conversely, if a state in |GHZ〉 class satisfies a3a5  ≠  a1a7 or a2a4  ≠   a0a6, then the state is not separable by the criterion for class A - B - C. Otherwise the state in |GHZ〉 class satisfies a3a5 = a1a7 and a2a4  =   a0a6. By the criterion for |GHZ〉 class, it follows that a0a7  -   a2a5 + (a1a6 - a3a4)  ≠  0. It means that it is impossible that a0a7 = a2a5 and a1a6 = a3a4. Thus the state in |GHZ〉 class is not in class A - B - C. Therefore the criteria for classes |GHZ〉 and A - B - C are exclusive.

Next let us deduce that the criteria for classes |GHZ〉 and A - BC are exclusive. From section 2 we know that any state in A - BC class satisfies a1a4 = a0a5, a3a6 = a2a7, a0a7  =   a3a4 and a1a6 = a2a5. Using these equalities we can derive that a0a7 - a2a5 + (a1a6 - a3a4) = 0 and (a2a4 - a0a6)(a3a5 - a1a7) = 0. It means that any state in A - BC class does not satisfy criterion for |GHZ〉 class. Conversely, if a state in |GHZ〉 class satisfies a0a7  ≠   a3a4 or a1a6  ≠  a2a5, then the state in |GHZ〉 class is not in A - BC class by the criterion for class A - BC. Otherwise the state in |GHZ〉 class satisfies a0a7  =   a3a4 and a1a6 = a2a5. Then by the criterion for |GHZ〉 class, it follows that (a2a4 - a0a6)(a3a5 - a1a7)  ≠  0. This results in that the state in |GHZ〉 class is not in A - BC class. Therefore the criteria for classes |GHZ〉 and A - BC are exclusive.

Similarly, we can infer that the criteria for classes |GHZ〉 and B - AC, and for classes |GHZ〉 and C - AB are exclusive, respectively.

Case 4. It is easy to see that the criteria for classes A - B - C , A - BC, B - AC and C - AB are pairwise exclusive.

Appendix B

Lemma. No states satisfy the following conditions. In other words, the conditions (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5) are inconsistent. Therefore the situation is not applicable. For other "not-occur" cases in table 1, the discussions are similar therefore omitted.

(a0a7 - a2a5 + (a1a6 - a3a4))2 = 4(a2a4 - a0a6)(a3a5 - a1a7).....(1)

a3a5 = a1a7......(2)

a2a4 = a0a6 .......(3)

a0a3  ≠   a1a2 or a5a6  ≠   a4a7 ......(4)

a1a4  ≠   a0a5 or a3a6  ≠  a2a7........(5)

Proof.

From (1), (2) and (3), we have the following

a0a7 - a3a4 = a2a5 - a1a6...........(6).

Next we prove that (4) holds means that (5) does not hold under (1), (2) and (3). That is, a0a3  ≠  a1a2 or a5a6  ≠   a4a7 results in a1a4  =   a0a5 and a3a6 = a2a7. There are two cases.

Case 1. a0a3  ≠   a1a2 implies a1a4  =   a0a5 and a3a6 = a2a7.

Case 1.1. Replacing a1a7 by a3a5 and a0a6 by a2a4 in a0a1(a0a7 - a3a4) = a0a1(a2a5 - a1a6) from (6) respectively, and by factoring we have (a0a3  -   a1a2)(a1a4  -   a0a5) = 0. Therefore a0a3  ≠   a1a2 yields a1a4  =   a0a5.

Case 1.2. Replacing a3a5 by a1a7 and a2a4 by a0a6 in a2a3(a0a7 - a3a4) = a2a3(a2a5 - a1a6) from (6) respectively, and by factoring we have

(a0a3  -   a1a2)(a2a7 - a3a6) = 0, which yields a3a6 = a2a7 since a0a3  ≠   a1a2.

Case 2. Suppose a5a6  ≠   a4a7. Similarly we can derive a1a4  =   a0a5 and a3a6 = a2a7.

Appendix C

Lemma. the criterion for B - AC class is equivalent to the following six conditions.

a0a7 - a3a4 = a2a5 - a1a6.....(1),

a2a4 = a0a6 .......(2),

a3a5 = a1a7 ......(3),

a0a3  =   a1a2 ........(4),

a5a6  =   a4a7 ......(5),

a1a4  ≠   a0a5 or a3a6  ≠  a2a7........(6).

For A - BC and C - AB, the discussion is similar to this one.

Proof. It is trivial to verify that the criterion for B - AC in section 2 satisfies the above conditions. Conversely, we can prove that the above conditions satisfy the criterion for B - AC. It is enough to show a0a7  =   a2a5 and a1a6 = a3a4. Replacing a2a4 by a0a6 and a1a2 by a0a3 respectively, in a2(a0a7 - a3a4) = a2(a2a5 - a1a6) from (1), we obtain a0a2a7  =   a22a5. When a2  ≠  0, we have a0a7  =   a2a5. Otherwise it is straightforward to obtain a0a7  =   a2a5 since it is trivial when a0 = 0 and a0  ≠  0 leads to a3 = a6 = 0 from (2) and (4) and further, a0a7 = 0 from (1). Similarly, replacing a1a7 by a3a5  and a1a2 by a0a3 respectively, in a1(a0a7 - a3a4) = a1(a2a5 - a1a6) from (1), we get a1a3a4 = a21a6. Then we observe a1a6 = a3a4 when a1  ≠  0. Otherwise it is easy to find a1a6 = a3a4.

Appendix D

Lemma. The criterion for A - B - C in section 2 is equivalent to the following equalities.

a0a7 - a3a4 = a2a5 - a1a6, a2a4 = a0a6, a3a5 = a1a7,

a0a3  =   a1a2, a5a6  =   a4a7, a1a4  =   a0a5, a3a6 = a2a7.

Proof. It is easy to verify that the criterion for A - B - C satisfies the above equalities. Conversely, in appendix C, by using the first five equalities we derive a0a7 = a2a5 and a1a6 = a3a4. Similarly, we can obtain a0a7 = a1a6, a1a6 = a2a5, a2a5 = a3a4, a0a7 = a3a4. Therefore the criterion for A - B - C is satisfied.

Appendix E

The necessary criterion of the entanglement class |W〉 for a four-qubit system

Proof.

Let α, β, γ and δ be operators and [formula] [formula], where δ  =   [formula] δ & δ [formula] δ & δ [formula]. Then

a0 = (α1β1γ1δ2  +  α1β1γ2δ1  +  α1β2γ1δ1  +  α2β1γ1δ1) / 2 and other ai are omitted.

Computing aiaj - akal, where i + j = k + l and [formula], we obtain the following equations:

a0a3  -   [formula]

[formula]

a1a4  -   [formula]

a3a6  -   [formula]

a3a5  -   [formula]

a2a4  -   [formula]

a8a11  -   [formula]

[formula]

a9a12  -   [formula]

a11a14  -   [formula]

a11a13  -   [formula]

a10a12  -   [formula]

From the above equations, we conclude the equalities of this criterion.

Next we argue that the inequalities hold. Given α, β, γ and δ are invertible. Assume that a0a3 = a1a2, a5a6  =   a4a7, a8a11  =   a9a10 and a13a14  =   a12a15. Then we obtain α1β1 = 0, α1β3 = 0, α3β1 = 0 and α3β3 = 0. Intuitively α1  ≠  0 or α3  ≠  0 results in β1  =  β3 = 0. Therefore these inequalities hold.
