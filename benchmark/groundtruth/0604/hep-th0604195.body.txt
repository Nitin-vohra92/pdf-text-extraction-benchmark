Stability analysis of the Randall-Sundrum braneworld in presence of bulk scalar

Standard model for strong, weak and electromagnetic interactions based on the gauge group SU(3)  ×  SU(2)  ×  U(1) has been extremely successful in explaining physical phenomena upto TeV scale. Such a model, however, encounters the well known fine tuning problem in connection with Higgs mass related to the gauge hierarchy problem which refers to the vast disparity between the weak and Planck scale. By invoking supersymmetry one can resolve this problem at the expense of incorporating a large number of (hitherto unseen) superpartners in the theory. In an alternative approach, theories with extra spatial dimension(s) have attracted a lot of attention because of the new geometric approach to solve the same problem and also the distinct features from ordinary Kaluza-Klien theory. In such models the standard model fields are localized on a 3+1 dimensional brane [\cite=arkani] [\cite=antoniadis] [\cite=witten] [\cite=rs] [\cite=lykken] [\cite=cohen] [\cite=kaloper] where gravity can propagate in the bulk spacetime. One of the most theoretically appealing and phenomenologically interesting model in this context was proposed by Randall and Sundrum (RS) [\cite=rs] where the mass hierarchy emerged naturally in an exponentially warped geometry along the extra dimension. The model contains two 3+1 dimensional branes sitting at the two orbifold fixed points where the single extra dimension in a 4+1 dimensional bulk has been compactified on a S1 / Z2 orbifold. The model contains two parameters namely the bulk cosmological constant Λ and the brane separation rc. The geometry and the Higgs mass is warped exponentially by a dimensionless parameter krc, where [formula], M being the 5D Planck mass. For the desired warping one should have krc  ~  11. If k  ~   Planck mass then, rc should have a stable value near Planck length. To stabilize the value of rc, Goldberger and Wise (GW) [\cite=gw] proposed a simple mechanism by introducing a minimally coupled massive scalar field in the bulk. Later several other works have been done in this direction [\cite=luty-sundrum] [\cite=maru] [\cite=ssg] [\cite=kogan]. In the original work of GW the effect of back-reaction of the scalar field on the background metric was neglected. Such back-reaction was later included in subsequent works and a modified solution for the metric was found [\cite=gub] [\cite=csaki]. In this paper we carefully re-examine the stability issue in the back-reacted RS model when the scalar field is introduced in bulk. We show on a very general ground that stabilization is not possible with a minimally coupled scalar field in the bulk. Following GW we subsequently show that if the dependence of scalar field action on the extra coordinate is tachyon-like then we can stabilize the brane world and the stabilized value of rc can produce the desired hierarchy from Planck scale to TeV scale.

Let us first consider the following bulk action [\cite=gw] [\cite=gub] [\cite=csaki] [\cite=bulk]

[formula]

where [formula] are a set of n scalar fields with a mixed potential V({φi}) and the index a runs over the brane locations. The corresponding brane potentials are denoted by λa.

Taking the line element in the form

[formula]

the field equations are given as where prime {'} denotes partial differentiation with respect to the extra spatial coordinate y.

The boundary conditions are

[formula]

Denoting C  =  1 / 24M3, it follows

In order to obtain analytic closed form solutions we resort to the particular class of effective potentials as in refs. [\cite=gub] [\cite=cvetic]:

[formula]

where

[formula]

is a sum of n superpotentials [formula].

Eqs.([\ref=efffeq]) lead to the first order equations:

[formula]

Following GW [\cite=gw], we calculate the effective potential Veff on the 3-brane as:

[formula]

where the Planck brane is located at y  =  0 and the visible brane is at y  =  yπ, and we have used the notations: [formula] for [formula]. Using the boundary conditions ([\ref=bc]) which now take the form the brane potentials λ0(φ) and λπ(φ) are given by [\cite=gub] where the constants γ0i and γπi, (for [formula]) are parameters of various potentials.

Now, in order to have extremum for the above effective potential at some value of yπ  ~  (=  ys, say)

[formula]

which implies W(yπ) ~  =  ~ 0 as well as ∂2Veff  /  ∂y2π ~  =  ~ 0 at yπ  =  ys. On the other hand, the third derivative is given by

[formula]

which is clearly non-vanishing in accord with the above boundary conditions. Therefore, no extremum exists and we only have a point of inflection at the value of yπ  =  ys for which W vanishes.

Let us now resort to a general solution ansatz for the metric function A(y) and single scalar field φ so that the standard RS [\cite=rs] solution is obtained in the limit where the scalar φ(y) becomes trivial:

[formula]

where a1,a2 are the initial parameters of the theory and constant k  ~   5D Planck scale as in the RS picture.

The field equations ([\ref=efffeq]) yield In the limit f  →  0, V  →    -  12M3k2  =  Λ which gives the standard AdS5 bulk geometry of RS model.

>From Eqs.([\ref=bc]), the boundary values of the brane potentials and their first derivatives are obtained as

At a stable point yπ  =  ys, the effective 4D potential ([\ref=effpot]) has a vanishing first derivative

[formula]

which at once implies that the second derivative ∂2Veff  /  ∂y2π also vanishes at the stable point ys. The third derivative, however, is given at yπ  =  ys as

[formula]

which is, of course, non-vanishing in consistence with Eq.([\ref=eom]a).

Considering, for example

[formula]

we find from Eqs.([\ref=eom])

[formula]

where W  =  12kM3  -  a2φ2. Clearly, one gets back the same results as discussed in [\cite=gub].

We now consider a tachyon-like scalar in the bulk [\cite=sen] [\cite=sk]. The action is given as

[formula]

where V is the potential of the field.

With a similar metric ansatz the field equations take the form and the corresponding boundary conditions are

[formula]

where {i} corresponds to the brane locations at orbifold fixed points along the extra direction.

Proceeding along the same line as in the previous section, we obtain from Eq.([\ref=teqm])

[formula]

Let us now consider the simple solution ansatz as

[formula]

where k,a1,a2 are the parameters of the theory. We get

These equations imply that a1  =  0 gives V  =   - 12k and φ  =   constant, indicating pure RS background. We are, however, interested in a1  ≠  0, in which case a real solution for φ can be obtained only when a1 is negative:

[formula]

After a long but straightforward calculation following GW [\cite=gw], we get

[formula]

So the stable point is at

[formula]

The corresponding metric function, upon setting |a1|  =  m2, is given by

[formula]

It is now clear that one can easily get the acceptable hierarchy by appropriately choosing the values of k / m and ka2 with the stabilized radius ys.

Our work clearly reveals an inherent instability in Randall-Sundrum two brane model. It is shown that just by introducing a canonical scalar field in the bulk, as initially suggested by GW, stabilization can not be achieved even with an arbitrary potential if full back-reaction of the scalar field on the metric is considered. However, we also show that in such models the two-brane separation can indeed be stabilized if the bulk scalar field has a tachyon-like action with respect to the bulk coordinate. We finally show that the full back-reacted metric in such case can also yield the desired warping from Planck scale to TeV scale and thus resolves the fine tuning problem of the Higgs mass in a stable braneworld scenario.
