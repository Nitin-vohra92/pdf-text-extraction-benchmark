Observation of superconducting gap in boron-doped diamond by laser-excited photoemission spectroscopy

Diamond has been well studied through the progress of solid state physics as one of the simplest sp3 covalent system. Although it is a typical band insulator with a gap of 5.5 eV, its high thermal conductivity owing to the high Debye temperature is well known also from the application point of view. When doped with boron (B), which plays a role of an accepter with the activation energy of 0.37 eV, the diamond behaves as a well organized p-type semiconductor. On increasing the B concentration (nB), the system goes across the insulator-metal (Mott) transition at nMIB  ~  2  ×  1020 cm- 3. It is recently that a striking discovery of the superconductivity (Tc  ~  2 K) was reported in B-concentration above nMIB [\cite=ekimov04]. Shortly after, by virtue of advanced crystal growth technique such as the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method, the sample quality and its Tc have become higher [\cite=takano04] [\cite=takanoDRM] [\cite=bustarret04] [\cite=umezawa05]. Such progress has made possible the experimental studies in a wide variety, and opens a new field for device applications using diamond related materials.

From the theoretical side, several scenarios have been proposed. The band calculations with the virtual crystal approximation (VCA) [\cite=boeri04] [\cite=lee04] predict that the top of the host diamond valence band at Γ-point is shifted above the Fermi level in the metallic region (e.g. 0.61 eV shift for 2.5% hole doping in [\cite=lee04]). The holes at the small pocket around Γ strongly couple to the optical phonon with ~  160 meV, which gives rise to the BCS-type superconductivity. Actually, the rigid shift of the valence band and the phonon softening at Γ-point are recently confirmed by the angle-resolved PES [\cite=yokoya05] and inelastic x-ray [\cite=hoesch05] measurements respectively, which shows that the above models are valid at least qualitatively. The supercell calculation points out a certain importance of the boron circumstance in addition, which has a large local density-of-states (DOS) at EF (though smaller than the total DOS of carbon) and modifies the host diamond band by its randomness [\cite=blase04] [\cite=xiang04]. They also show that the local B-C vibration mode will significantly contribute to the electron-phonon coupling constant λ. On the contrary, there is a theoretical report which is entirely based upon the half-filled narrow boron impurity band as schematically realized in the Mott transition picture [\cite=baskaran04]. This scenario will produce a dirty superconducting state with an extended s-wave gap by an exotic pairing interaction, resonating-valence-bond (RVB) mechanism, which manifests itself in a strong correlation regime.

In this study, we investigated the low-energy electronic structure of the B-doped diamond to clarify the characteristics of the superconductivity realized in this doped semiconductor system. By using the ultrahigh resolution laser-excited photoemission spectroscopy, we succeeded in the observation of the superconducting gap evolving below 11 K. We discuss our result in the light of boron-induced disorder effect.

PES measurements were performed using a system constructed with the Scienta R4000 electron analyzer and an ultraviolet (hν = 6.994 eV) laser for the incident light [\cite=kiss05]. The escape depth of the photoelectron in this energy region (i.e. kinetic energy of 2  ~  3 eV) attains a large value of ~  100 Å, [\cite=seah79] which enables us the bulk-sensitive measurements. The temperature was precisely controlled down to 4.5 K using a flow-type He liquid refrigerator. The base pressure of the chamber was below ~  5  ×  10- 11 Torr throughout all the measurements. We annealed the samples before the measurement at 400 [formula]C in the vacuum of <  10- 7 Torr. This procedure increased the photoelectron intensity near the Fermi level (EF) for about a factor of 10 times, while not changing the spectral shape. Since we could not catch clear evidence of angle-resolved (k-dispersed) signal, all measurements were performed with an angle-integration mode. The energy resolution was ΔE  =   0.7 meV. The Fermi level (EF) of the sample was referred to that of the Au film evaporated on the sample substrate.

The B-doped diamond (BDD) sample we used for our measurement is obtained by a microwave plasma-assisted chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method as described elsewhere [\cite=takano04] [\cite=umezawa05]. It was grown homoepitaxially on an undoped (1 1 1) oriented diamond synthesized in high pressure and high temperature [\cite=umezawa05]. The BDD thus grown is single crystalline. The boron concentration determined by the secondary ion mass spectroscopy method is nB = 8.4  ×  1021 cm- 3, which corresponds to B/C ratio of 5%. The carrier density estimated from the Hall coefficient is nH = 1.3  ×  1022 cm- 3 [\cite=umezawa05]. We show in Fig. [\ref=fig1] the resistivity and magnetization curves for the BDD sample. The superconducting transition temperature of this sample determined from the Meissner response is Tmc  =  6.6 K as indicated in the inset of Fig. [\ref=fig1](b). The diamagnetic response keeps increasing on lowering the temperature down to 2 K without any sign of saturation, reflecting the disordered nature of the superconductivity. The resistivity, on the other hand, steeply starts decreasing at 8.2 K and shows the zero-resistivity at around 7 K. There is another characteristic temperature T0  ~  11 K where the resistivity starts to deviate from that of the weakly insulating normal state under the magnetic field, which will be discussed later. The normal-state resistivity is almost temperature-independent with the values of ρ(300K) = 0.59 mΩ (not shown) and ρ(10K) = 0.68 mΩ, indicative of the fairly localized carrier dynamics in this system. Here we estimate the carrier mean free path from [formula] and kF = (3π2n)1 / 3 in a simple free-electron picture. Substituting ρ(10K) and the above mentioned nH for the carrier density n, we obtain l = 3.4 Å. It is nearly equivalent with the cubic lattice parameter a = 3.57 Å [\cite=umezawa05] indicating that this system is fairly close to the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit [\cite=takagi92]. We also note that this value coincides with that previously reported by Sidorov et al. in a lower-doped single crystalline sample (nH  ~  1.8  ×  1021 cm- 3, ρ(10K)  ~  2.5 mΩcm) [\cite=sidorov05]. Since kF is greater in our sample with higher n, the carrier mobility [formula] must be lower instead in order to obtain the same l, where τ and m* represent the lifetime and the effective mass of the carriers. On the other hand, the coherence length estimated from the upper critical field Hc2 is ξ  ~  60 Å >  l [\cite=umezawa05], which classifies this BDD sample as a dirty superconductor.

Figure [\ref=fig2] shows the photoelectron spectrum (PES) of the superconducting state observed in the BDD sample. With decreasing temperature from 15.5 K, a slight shift of the spectral edge can be observed below 9.5 K (see the enlarged plot in Fig. [\ref=fig2](b)). At the same time, the spectral shape becomes slightly convex downward at EF. Such temperature dependence is indicative of a gap opening at EF, which is a clear evidence of the mass superconductivity in this sample. Even at the lowest temperature (4.5 K), however, a considerable amount of DOS at EF remains and a clear quasiparticle peak cannot be observed. We tried to estimate the gap value at 4.5 K by fitting the PES using the Dynes function [\cite=dynes78] for the DOS represented with the isotropic (s-wave) superconducting gap and the phenomenological broadening parameters Δ and Γ, as

[formula]

The best-fitted result is shown in Fig. [\ref=fig2](c) as the red curve, with the parameters Δ  =  0.78 meV and Γ  =  0.7 meV. We note that Γ is remarkably large, Γ  ≈  Δ, which accounts for the large DOS at EF and the hardly recognizable quasiparticle peak. Due to such spectral shape, it is impossible at present to discuss the superconducting gap symmetry, whether it is simple s-wave or not, solely from our result. Here we estimate the reduced gap Δ(0) / kBTc from our result at the lowest temperature, ie. Δ(4.5K) = 0.78 meV, by simply assuming the BCS-like temperature dependence of Δ(T). If we take Tc = Tmc = 6.6 K, Δ(0) / kBTc  =  1.78 is obtained with Δ(0) = 1.01 meV. It is close to a typical value for weakly-coupled BCS superconductors. This result thus seems to suggest that Δ we observed is well related in a weak-coupling regime with Tmc where the superconductivity shows up in the volume-sensitive magnetization.

To confirm the evolution of the gap structure itself, we show in Fig. [\ref=fig3] the PES symmetrized at EF to remove the spectral cutoff by the Fermi-Dirac distribution. It is now clearly recognized that the intensity at EF starts to decrease and gradually forms a gap below 9.5 K. Also in this symmetrized PES which represents the DOS, we cannot discern a well-defined quasiparticle peak. This result is in a striking contrast to that of scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) study on a (1 0 0) CVD thin film with Tc = 1.9 K and nB = 1.9  ×  1021 cm- 3 [\cite=sacepe05], where a superconducting gap spectrum with well defined quasiparticle peaks (Δ = 0.285 meV and Γ  =  255 mK = 0.022 meV at T = 70 mK) is observed. Furthermore, its temperature dependence is well in accord with the weak-coupling BCS gap function with Δ(0)  =  1.74kBTc. On the other hand, another very recent STS result on a (1 1 1) CVD thin film with nB = 6  ×  1021 cm- 3 and Tmc = 5.4 K shows a broad superconducting gap spectrum fairly similar to ours with Δ = 0.87 meV and Γ = 0.38 meV at 0.47 K [\cite=nishizaki06]. Both measurements report that the STS spectra reflecting the local DOS show very little dependence on the location at the sample surfaces, which should rule out the possibility of mesoscopic (nanoscale) modification of the superconducting state in these samples. The discrepancy among the results on (1 0 0) and (1 1 1) samples may be explained by the difference in nB. We note that on increasing nB, the mobility tends to get lower reflecting the disorder induced by random boron doping. Recent ARPES result also shows that the lifetime of the carriers estimated from the spectral linewidth becomes shorter in the sample with higher nB [\cite=yokoya05]. They indicate the possible dirtiness of the electronic structure in high-nB samples, which gives rise to the superconducting gap with large Γ as observed in (1 1 1) samples. Another possibility is the extrinsic sample inhomogeneity which is known to be greater in (1 1 1) samples. It is actually reported that there are two structural phases with slightly different lattice constants in (1 1 1) samples when nB and Tc become high (Tmc  >  6 K) [\cite=takenouchi06]. Since the lattice constant of a heavily B-doped diamond is greater than that of undoped ones by about 0.5%, there is a tendency toward a uniaxially expanded phase near the substrate and an isotropically relaxed phase for the rest. Though exactly how these two phases coexist in BDD thin films is yet under investigation, such local inhomogeneity may account for the lousy superconducting gap structure in our PES result.

Now we discuss the temperature dependence of the superconducting gap in this sample. Since it is very difficult to get accurate gap values by fitting these rather featureless spectra for all temperatures, we simply estimated the energy shift of the leading edge in PES (Fig. [\ref=fig2]) instead. Its temperature dependence in Fig. [\ref=fig4] rather resembles that of the Meissner response which monotonically keeps growing on decreasing temperature, as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig1](b). The onset temperature of gap evolution at around T0  ~  11 K, however, is apparently higher than that of the magnetization, Tmc = 6.6 K. Looking back on the resistivity curve in Fig. [\ref=fig1](a), we find a characteristic behavior at around T0. At T0, the resistivity starts to deviate from the weakly insulating normal state which is apparent under a magnetic field. Such a deviation may be reflecting the inhomogeneous conductivity near Tc, which attributes T0 to the onset of the local superconducting transition and Toffc  ~  7 K to the temperature of bulk supercurrent percolation. If this is the case, our PES result is suggestive of its high sensitivity that probes the local superconducting state with high Tc. At the same time, it shows the potential for development of a diamond superconductor with Tc  ~  11 K by aggregating such local "high-Tc" segments.

In conclusion, we have performed an ultrahigh resolution photoemission spectroscopy measurement to elucidate the near-EF electronic structure of the superconducting boron-doped diamond with Tmc = 6.6 K. We observed the gradual formation of the superconducting gap below T0  ~  11 K, the temperature where the deviation of the resistivity from the normal state is observed. The dominant size of the gap, though under an uncertainty due to the lack of quasiparticle peak, is estimated to be about Δ = 0.78 meV at 4.5 K. Its broad spectral shape and the diffusive temperature dependence indicate that the superconductivity in this system is strongly affected by randomness and/or inhomogeneity introduced by boron doping. Further precise investigation is desired using samples with the least extrinsic nonstoichiometry.
