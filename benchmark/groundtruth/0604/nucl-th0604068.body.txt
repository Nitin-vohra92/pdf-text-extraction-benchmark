Relating pseudospin and spin symmetries through charge conjugation and chiral transformations: the case of the relativistic harmonic oscillator

Introduction

Recently, there has been a wide interest in relativistic potentials involving mixtures of vector and scalar potentials with opposite signs. The interest lies on attempts to explain the pseudospin symmetry in nuclear physics. Chen et al. [\cite=che], using a Dirac Hamiltonian with scalar Vs and vector Vv potentials quadratic in space coordinates, found a harmonic-oscillator-like second order equation which can be solved analytically for Δ = Vt - Vs = 0, as considered before by Kukulin et al. [\cite=kuk], and also for Σ = Vt + Vs = 0. Very recently, Ginocchio solved the triaxial, axial, and spherical harmonic oscillators for the case Δ = 0 and applied it to the study of antinucleons embedded in nuclei [\cite=gin2]. The case Σ = 0 is particularly relevant in nuclear physics, since it is usually pointed out as a necessary condition for occurrence of pseudospin symmetry in nuclei [\cite=gin3]-[\cite=gin5]. Also the observed isospin dependence of pseudospin can be explained by the effect of the ρ potential on the shape of the Σ potential [\cite=meng0]-[\cite=bjp34]. As shown by Bell and Ruegg [\cite=bell], the Δ = 0 and Σ = 0 cases correspond to a SU(2) symmetry of the Dirac Hamiltonian with only scalar and vector potentials which is independent of the particular shapes of these potentials.

A generalized harmonic oscillator (HO) for spin 1/2 particles that includes not only those combinations of scalar and vector potentials, but also a linear tensor potential, giving rise to the so-called Dirac oscillator, has also been considered in [\cite=nosso]. The research of this kind of interaction was started by Itô [\cite=ito] and has been revived by Moshinsky and Szczepaniak [\cite=mosh1] (see [\cite=nosso] for a complete reference list).

In Ref. [\cite=nosso] a special attention was paid to the case when the scalar and vector potentials are such that Σ = 0, which, as stated before, has been related to the nuclear pseudospin symmetry. There it has been concluded that only when the tensor potential is turned on one gets negative energy bound-state solutions along with the usual positive energy solutions. Those negative energy solutions are important to describe the possible existence of antinucleons in nuclei [\cite=gin5]. When the tensor potential is absent the special conditions relating the scalar and vector potentials (Vs  =    ±  Vt) are needed to have a standard positive HO potential which is only able to bind fermions, and therefore exclude the negative bound-state solutions from the spectra. Actually, as was discussed in another context in [\cite=asc3], with an appropriate choice of signs, potentials fulfilling the relations Vs  =    ±  Vt are able to bind either fermions or antifermions. As an example, we will see later that a (negative) harmonic potential, with no tensor potential, binds antifermions and does not allow positive bound-state solutions.

Closely related to this is the fact that, in the nucleus, the charge-conjugation transformation relates the spin symmetry of the negative bound-state solutions (antinucleons) to the pseudospin symmetry of the positive bound-state solutions (nucleons) [\cite=Zhou]. This has also been discussed recently in [\cite=gin2], analyzing the HO for antinucleons with spin symmetry (Δ = 0) and without the tensor interaction. Again, the charge conjugation connects this problem with the HO for nucleons with pseudospin symmetry (Σ = 0), but in this case the positive harmonic binding potential is Δ. Note that, because the harmonic potential does not vanish for large distances but is a confining potential, it is possible to obtain particle bound-state solutions in the exact pseudospin limit [\cite=nosso]. Therefore, we believe that this connection between spin and pseudospin symmetry obtained by charge conjugation deserves to be more explored. In addition, after the pseudospin symmetry has been revealed as a relativistic symmetry by Ginocchio [\cite=gin3], a link of it to chiral symmetry has been suggested based on sum rules calculations in relativistic chiral models that support a small value for Σ [\cite=furn]. However, until now, a clear connection of pseudospin and chiral symmetries has not been established.

The main motivation of this paper is to shed some light in the relation between spin and pseudospin symmetries by means of charge-conjugation and γ5 chiral transformations. In order to do so, we solve the mixed scalar-vector-pseudoscalar HO potential in 1+1 dimensions, taking advantage of the simplicity of the lowest dimensionality of the space-time. This approach is equivalent to consider fermions in 3+1 dimensions which are restricted to move in one direction [\cite=str]. We explore the spectra when it is possible to obtain analytical solutions, i.e., in the particular cases when Δ = 0 and Σ = 0. As referred before, if the pseudocalar term is turned off, these cases correspond, respectively, to have exact spin and pseudospin symmetry in 3+1 dimensions. We explore all the possible signs of the quadratic (Δ or Σ) and linear (pseudoscalar) potentials, thus paying attention to bound states of fermions and antifermions as well. We compare both cases Δ = 0 and Σ = 0 to establish the charge-conjugation connection discussed above in the presence of the pseudoscalar term. We also consider the case of zero mass to look for the connection between spin and pseudospin symmetries by means of the chiral transformation.

An added motivation for this paper is given by the recent demonstration that the relativistic 3+1 HO with scalar and vector potentials can describe successfully the heavy nucleus spectrum [\cite=guo]. The parameters of the HO are determined by fitting the scalar and vector potentials derived from Relativistic Mean Field nuclear calculations (RMF). The 208Pb neutron single-particle levels obtained in the HO are very similar to the RMF results. The pseudospin symmetry is shown to be almost satisfied for a heavy nucleus in the HO description. The possibility of breaking perturbatively this symmetry in the 3+1 HO by a tensor interaction (in our 1+1 case a pseudoscalar coupling) has been discussed in [\cite=ronai] and can be included in a calculation like the one of Ref. [\cite=guo] in order to improve the results. Thus, the study of all the possible eigenenergies of the 1+1 HO, presented in this paper, considering not only the positive energy solutions already obtained for the 3+1 case in [\cite=nosso] but also the negative ones, can be applied to analyze the existence of antinucleons in nuclei and their spectrum.

The particle and antiparticle spectra we obtain for the cases Σ = 0 and Δ = 0 demonstrate the charge-conjugation connection referred above. They also show that the spectra of massless Δ = 0 states are degenerate with massless Σ = 0 states. Further imposing chiral symmetry to these states, such that they would become eigenstates of γ5, would imply that all potentials would be zero and thus one would have just massless free fermions. Our conclusions are valid in the case of 3+1 dimensions, because, as will be shown later, one basically has to add the angular momentum quantum numbers [formula] and κ to the coefficients of the functions appearing in the 1+1 eigenvalue equations in order to get the corresponding 3+1 equations.

This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. [\ref=Sec:Dirac_1+1] we present the general Dirac equation in 1+1 dimensions with a potential with a completely general Lorentz structure. The effect of charge-conjugation and the γ5 chiral transformations upon the general 1+1 Dirac Hamiltonian is discussed in Secs. [\ref=SubSec:charge_conj] and [\ref=SubSec:chiral] respectively. In Secs. [\ref=SubSec:Eq_motion] and [\ref=SubSec:Sturm-Liouville] we present the equations of motion and discuss the isolated solutions, i.e., the solutions out of the Sturm-Liouville problem, for Δ = 0 and Σ = 0. The nonrelativistic limits of the Δ = 0 and Σ = 0 cases are discussed in Sec. [\ref=SubSec:nonrel_limit], where we show that when Σ = 0 there is no nonrelativistic limit when the pseudoscalar potential vanishes or is very small. In Sec. [\ref=Sec:rel_h_oscillator] we introduce the general relativistic harmonic oscillator in 1+1 dimensions for Δ = 0 by assigning a quadratic potential k1x2 / 2 for Σ and a linear potential k2x for the pseudoscalar potential Vp. There we also present the eigenvalue equation and the wave functions for bound states, discuss the Dirac oscillator case (Δ  =  Σ = 0 and [formula]) and show how one can use the charge-conjugation and chiral transformations to get the eigenenergies for the Σ = 0 case from the Δ = 0 case. The following section is devoted to a detailed analysis of the solutions of the Δ = 0 relativistic HO for all signs of the parameters k1 and k2. Finally in Sec. [\ref=Sec:sol_sym_arg] we discuss the spectrum for Σ = 0 and massless fermions and in Sec. [\ref=Sec:conclusions] we draw the conclusions.

The Dirac equation in 1+1 dimensions

The two-dimensional Dirac equation can be obtained from the four-dimensional one with the mixture of spherically symmetric scalar, vector and anomalous magnetic-like (tensor) interactions. If we limit the fermion motion to the x-direction (py = pz = 0) the four-dimensional Dirac equation decomposes into two equivalent two-dimensional equations with 2-component spinors and 2×  2 matrices [\cite=str]. Then, there results that the scalar and vector interactions preserve their Lorentz structures whereas the anomalous magnetic-like interaction turns out to be a pseudoscalar interaction. Furthermore, in the 1+1 world there is no angular momentum so that the spin is absent. Therefore, the 1+1 dimensional Dirac equation allows us to explore the physical consequences of the negative-energy states in a mathematically simpler and more physically transparent way. In this spirit the two-dimensional version of the anomalous magnetic-like interaction linear in the space coordinate has also received attention [\cite=nogami]-[\cite=asc1]. Later this system was shown to be a particular case of a more general class of exactly solvable problems [\cite=asc2].

Let us begin by presenting the Dirac equation in 1+1 dimensions. The Dirac equation for a particle with mass m and a general potential V, to be defined later, is formally the same as its 3+1 counterpart:

[formula]

Here μ = 0,1 and the 2  ×  2 matrices γμ obey the usual relations {γμ,γν} = 2gμνI, where I is the 2  ×  2 identity matrix. The metric tensor and the covariant derivative operator are, respectively, [formula] and [formula]. The Hamiltonian is defined in the usual way, such that Eq. ([\ref=eq_Dirac_gen]) is written as

[formula]

where [formula]. The positive definite function [formula], satisfying a continuity equation, is interpreted as a position probability density and its norm is a constant of motion. This interpretation is completely satisfactory for single-particle states [\cite=tha]. The traceless matrices α and β are defined by α  =  γ0γ1 and β  =  γ0, and obey the relations α2  =  β2 = I, {α,β} = 0. We set V to be

[formula]

where γ5  =  γ0γ1  =  α. This is the most general combination of Lorentz structures because there are only four linearly independent 2×  2 matrices. The subscripts for the terms of the potential denote their properties under a Lorentz transformation: t and sp for the time and space components of the 2-vector potential, s and p for the scalar and pseudoscalar terms, respectively.

If the terms in the potential V are time-independent, the Dirac equation ([\ref=def_hamiltoniano_d]) becomes

[formula]

where

[formula]

and E is the fermion energy. To have an explicit expression for the α and β matrices one can choose 2×  2 Pauli matrices which satisfy the same algebra. We use β  =  σ3, α  =  σ1 and thus βγ5 = iσ2.

The Hamiltonian ([\ref=time_ind_H]) is invariant under the parity operation, i.e., when x  →   - x, Vsp(x) and Vp(x) change sign, whereas Vt(x) and Vs(x) remain the same. This is because the parity operator is P =  exp (iη)P0σ3, where η is a constant phase and P0 changes x into - x. Since this unitary operator anticommutes with α and βγ5, they change sign under a parity transformation, whereas I and β, which commute with P, remain the same. When one writes down the explicit equations of motion in terms of the components of the spinor ψ̃, the combinations Σ = Vt + Vs and Δ = Vt - Vs of the vector and scalar components arise naturally. Therefore, it is convenient to rewrite the Hamiltonian ([\ref=time_ind_H]) in terms of these potentials. We have

[formula]

Charge conjugation

The charge-conjugation operation changes the sign of the electromagnetic interaction, i.e., changes the sign of the time and space potentials in ([\ref=def_V]). This is accomplished by the transformation (see, for example, Itzykson and Zuber [\cite=Itzykson_Zuber])

[formula]

where T denotes matrix transposition and C is a matrix such that Cγμ  TC- 1 =  - γμ. In 1 + 1 dimensions one matrix that satisfies this relation is

[formula]

If we choose the phase factor eiθ equal to 1, we have

[formula]

After applying this charge-conjugation operation to the Dirac equation ([\ref=def_hamiltoniano_d]), the time-independent Dirac equation becomes

[formula]

where [formula] and Hc is given by

[formula]

In terms of the potentials Δ and Σ, this Hamiltonian reads

[formula]

One sees that the charge-conjugation operation changes the sign of the energy and of the potentials Vt, Vsp and Vp. In turn, this means that Σ turns into -  Δ and Δ into -  Σ. Therefore, to be invariant under charge conjugation, the Hamiltonian must contain only a scalar potential.

Chiral transformation

The chiral operator for a Dirac spinor is the matrix γ5, and we will call "chiral transformation" the transformation associated with it. Thus, the transformed spinor is given by Ψχ  =  γ5Ψ and the transformed Hamiltonian Hχ  =  γ5Hγ5. Since γ5 anticommutes with β, the time-independent chiral-transformed Dirac equation is

[formula]

where Hχ is given by

[formula]

or

[formula]

in terms of Σ and Δ. This means that the chiral transformation changes the sign of the mass and of the scalar and pseudoscalar potentials, thus turning Σ into Δ and vice-versa. A chiral-invariant Hamiltonian needs to have zero mass and Vs and Vp zero everywhere.

Equations of motion

The space component of the 2-vector potential in ([\ref=def_V]) can be absorbed into the wave function by defining a new spinor ψ such that

[formula]

in which [formula], since we have Hψ̃ = e- iΛ(H - αVsp)ψ. From this point on, we will refer to Vt as simply a vector potential, following the common usage of this term (usually denoted by Vv). If we now write the spinor ψ in terms of its components,

[formula]

the Dirac equation gives rise to two coupled first-order equations for ψ+ and ψ-:

[formula]

where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to x. In terms of ψ+ and ψ- the spinor is normalized as [formula], so that ψ+ and ψ- are square integrable functions. It is clear from the pair of coupled first-order differential equations ([\ref=eq_mot_1]) and ([\ref=eq_mot_2]) that ψ+ and ψ- have opposite parities if the Dirac equation is covariant under x  →   - x.

Under the charge-conjugation and chiral transformations the spinor ([\ref=def_psi_comp]) becomes

[formula]

and

[formula]

respectively.

The Sturm-Liouville problem and isolated solutions

Using the expression for ψ- obtained from ([\ref=eq_mot_2]) with E  ≠   - mc2  +  Δ, viz.

[formula]

and inserting it in ([\ref=eq_mot_1]) one arrives at the following second-order differential equation for ψ+:

[formula]

In a similar way, using the expression for ψ+ obtained from ([\ref=eq_mot_1]) with E  ≠  mc2  +  Σ, viz.

[formula]

and inserting it in ([\ref=eq_mot_2]) one arrives at the following second-order differential equation for ψ-:

[formula]

For Δ = 0 with E  ≠   - mc2, ([\ref=psi-_gen]) and ([\ref=2_order_gen_psi+]) reduce to

[formula]

[formula]

and for Σ = 0 with E  ≠  mc2, ([\ref=psi+_gen]) and ([\ref=2_order_gen_psi-]) reduce to

[formula]

[formula]

Either for Δ = 0 with E  ≠   - mc2 or Σ = 0 with E  ≠  mc2 the solution of the relativistic problem is mapped into a Sturm-Liouville problem in such a way that solution can be found by solving a Schrödinger-like problem. If one considers potentials Vt and Vs quadratic in x with Vt  =    ±  Vs and a potential Vp linear in x one obtains Schr'odinger-like equations for the harmonic oscillator potential.

The solutions for Δ = 0 with E =  - mc2 and Σ = 0 with E = mc2, excluded from the Sturm-Liouville problem, can be obtained directly from the original first-order equations ([\ref=eq_mot_1]) and ([\ref=eq_mot_2]). They are

[formula]

and

[formula]

where ψ(0)+ and ψ(0)- are normalization constants. Since, by parity conservation, Vp must be an odd function of x, its integral must be an even function of x. Thus, if the integral of Vp has a definite sign, its overall sign can determine whether the isolated solutions ([\ref=isol_sol_Delta=0]) and ([\ref=isol_sol_Sigma=0]) are bound states. In particular, if Vp and Σ or Δ are powers of x, one sees from each pair of equations ([\ref=isol_sol_Delta=0]) and ([\ref=isol_sol_Sigma=0]) that, in general, one of the spinor components has to be zero, either ψ+ in the first case (sign of the Vp coefficient positive) or ψ- in the last case (sign of the Vp coefficient negative). This is the case of the harmonic oscillator potentials, as we will see in the next section. However, it is possible find solutions with the Vp coefficient negative in the first case (Δ = 0, E =  - mc2) and with the Vp coefficient positive in the second case (Σ = 0, E = mc2), provided a certain relation between the coefficients of all the potentials is satisfied, as we will see later.

The nonrelativistic limit

In the nonrelativistic limit, E  ~  mc2, Eq. ([\ref=2_order_gen_psi+]) becomes

[formula]

where E = E - mc2. Since, in the nonrelativistic regime, for the range of values of x in which the wave function is not negligible, |Δ(x)|  ≪  mc2, from Eq. ([\ref=psi-_gen]) we see that ψ- is of order v / c  ≪  1 relative to ψ+, provided, of course, one has also |Vp(x)|  ≪  mc2. On the other hand, since in these conditions 2mc2  -  Δ  ~  2mc2 and the Δ' term in Eq. ([\ref=eq_mot_nr2a]) is suppressed relative to the other terms, we also see that ψ+ obeys a Schrödinger equation with binding energy equal to E = E - mc2.

We shall consider now the nonrelativistic limit in the special cases Δ = 0 and Σ = 0, which we will also consider later in the paper when we solve the Dirac equation for harmonic oscillator potentials.

When Δ = 0, Eq. ([\ref=eq_mot_nr2a]) becomes

[formula]

Here we clearly see that Σ plays the role of a binding potential in the nonrelativistic limit and that Vp gives rise to effective binding potentials proportional to [formula] and V2p. This means that even a pseudoscalar potential unbounded from below could be a confining potential. Note that if Vp / (mc2) is of the same order that Σ / (mc2) in a 1 / (mc2) expansion within the classically accessible region (positive kinetic energy) where the wave function is not negligible, and if its variation over this region is such that [formula] (Vp changes very little over a distance of the order of a Compton wavelength), Vp gets suppressed relative to Σ.

For the case Σ = 0 and if |Δ| / (mc2) is very small in the classically accessible region, Eq. ([\ref=eq_mot_nr2a]) becomes

[formula]

If Vp = 0 or if, as explained before, the V2p and V'p terms are higher-order terms in a 1 / (mc2) expansion within the classically accessible region, Eq. ([\ref=eq_mot_nr2a_Sigma=0]) becomes a free particle Schrödinger equation. This is in agreement with what was found in Ref. [\cite=nosso], namely that when Σ = Vp = 0 and Δ is a three-dimensional harmonic oscillator potential, there is no nonrelativistic limit. In this case we were able to show that this is true in a more general framework. A model for a relativistic particle in which the vector and scalar potentials are such that Σ = 0, and where the pseudoscalar potential is suppressed, is intrinsically relativistic, as far as bound states are concerned.

This last result deserves some more comments. The fact that in a Dirac equation one can have Lorentz scalar and pseudoscalar potentials leads to remarkable results that are at odds with what is known from nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, where the Lorentz structure plays no role, since one has only potentials which couple to the energy, i.e., behave as time components of a relativistic vector. Among these results is the fact that the Dirac equation is not invariant under a simultaneous shift of the energy, the scalar potential, and the pseudoscalar potential. It has already been verified that a constant added to the pseudoscalar screened Coulomb potential [\cite=asc10] or to the pseudoscalar inversely linear potential [\cite=asc100] is physically relevant and plays a crucial role in ensuring the existence of bound states. As an example of another notable result, it is well known that a confining potential for a nonrelativistic fermion cannot confine it in the relativistic regime when the potential is considered as a Lorentz vector (see, e.g., [\cite=tha]), simply because there is pair creation and the single-particle picture does not hold anymore. It is surprising that the converse is also true, i.e., that relativistic binding potentials may not bind in the nonrelativistic limit. This is the case of Vt =  - Vs (Σ = 0) referred before, and is basically due to the fact that vector potentials couple in a different way than scalar potentials in the Dirac equation, whereas there is no such distinction in the Schrödinger equation. Actually, as we have seen before, Σ, which is the sum of a vector and a scalar potential, plays the role of a binding potential in the nonrelativistic limit, whereas a weak enough Δ cannot bind a fermion with nonrelativistic energy if Σ = 0. Note that for potentials going to zero at infinity, like mean-field nuclear potentials, there are no bound states when Σ = 0, even if Δ is not small compared with fermion rest energy [\cite=gin3]-[\cite=alb2].

Regarding antiparticles, an attractive vector potential for a particle is, of course, repulsive for its corresponding antiparticle, and vice versa. However, the attractive (repulsive) scalar potential for particles is also attractive (repulsive) for antiparticles. This is expressed in the change Δ  →    -  Σ and Σ  →    -  Δ under charge conjugation, as referred in Sec. [\ref=SubSec:charge_conj]. This means that an antiparticle with nonrelativistic energies (E  ≈   - mc2) will not be bound when Δ = 0, provided Vp is small enough.

The relativistic harmonic oscillator

Let us consider

[formula]

As we have seen in the last section, the chiral transformation performs the changes Δ  →  Σ, Σ  →  Δ, m  →   - m and Vp  →   - Vp. Morever, since γ5 interchanges the upper and lower components (see ([\ref=psi_comp_chiral])), the resulting pair of transformed equations of motion are formally the same, so that their solutions have the same energy eigenvalues. This symmetry can be clearly seen from the two equation pairs ([\ref=psi-_gen])-([\ref=2_order_gen_psi+]) and ([\ref=psi+_gen])-([\ref=2_order_gen_psi-]) as well as from the isolated solutions ([\ref=isol_sol_Delta=0]) and ([\ref=isol_sol_Sigma=0]) which are converted into each other by this kind of transformation. This means that one can restrict the discussion to the Σ case (Δ = 0). The results for the case when [formula] can be obtained immediately by just changing the sign of m and of k2 in the relevant expressions.

The Dirac spinor corresponding to the isolated solution with E =  - mc2 is obtained from ([\ref=isol_sol_Delta=0]). Only for k2 > 0 there is a normalizable Dirac spinor and, as commented before, the upper component vanishes whereas the lower component is given by [formula], regardless the value of k2. For E  ≠   - mc2, Eq. ([\ref=2_order_Delta=0_psi+]) takes the form

[formula]

where

[formula]

The well-behaved solution for ([\ref=2_order_Delta=0_OH_psi+]), with K necessarily real and positive, is the well-known solution of the Schrödinger equation for the nonrelativistic harmonic oscillator (see, e.g., [\cite=sch]):

[formula]

where [formula], Nn is a normalization constant, [formula] is a n-th degree Hermite polynomial and

[formula]

The lower component of the Dirac spinor is obtained from ([\ref=psi-_Delta=0]). When one uses the recursion relations for the Hermite polynomials (see, e.g., [\cite=abra]) one gets

[formula]

Since the Hermite polynomial [formula] has n distinct zeros one may conclude that ψ+ has n nodes, and the expression for ψ- suggests that it has n  ±  1 nodes, depending on the sign k2. In fact, if k1 = 0, this last expression reduces to

[formula]

showing that ψ- is proportional to Hn + 1(λx) if k2 is positive. If k2 < 0, the recursion relations of Hermite polynomials imply that ψ- is proportional to Hn - 1(λx) (see [\cite=abra]).

From Eqs. ([\ref=def_K]), ([\ref=def_EE]) and ([\ref=Delta=0_OH_EE]) we can get the quantization condition for the Dirac eigenenergies:

[formula]

The nonrelativistic limit is reached when 2|k1| / (m3c4)  ≪  1 and 2| / (m2c3)  ≪  1. In this case E  ~  mc2 for small quantum numbers, and Eq. ([\ref=eigen_eq_Delta=0]) becomes

[formula]

so that k1 is restricted to k1 >  - k22 / (mc2).

In general there is no requirements on the signs of k1 and k2, except that, as stated before, K > 0, and therefore, from ([\ref=def_K]), the Dirac eigenenergies corresponding to the bound-state solutions must be within the limits

[formula]

For k1 = 0, when there is a pure pseudoscalar potential linear in x (the two-dimensional Dirac oscillator), Eq. ([\ref=eigen_eq_Delta=0]) reduces to

[formula]

Note that n  ≥  0 for k2 > 0 and n  ≥  1 for k2 < 0, because for the latter case the lower component is proportional to a Hermite polynomial of degree n - 1. This result, together with Eq. ([\ref=energy_eigen_k1=0]), allows us to conclude that the Dirac eigenvalues are given by E =   ±  E0, where [formula], [formula], irrespective of the sign of k2. This means that the spectrum is independent of the sign of k2. The solutions E = mc2 and E =  - mc2 correspond to isolated solutions for k2 < 0 and k2 > 0, respectively (see Eqs. ([\ref=isol_sol_Delta=0]) and ([\ref=isol_sol_Sigma=0])). However, the spinors do depend on the sign of k2, because different signs induce different node structures, as can be seen from ([\ref=psi-_Delta=0_k1=0]). Since the charge-conjugation transformation changes the sign of k2, it connects both kinds of solutions, but each can have both positive and negative energies. Thus a complete set of states for a certain k2 includes both particle (positive energy) and antiparticle (negative energy) states but they are not related to each other by a charge-conjugation transformation. The spectral gap between these solutions is [formula] and does not disappear when m = 0. Therefore, there is no room for transitions from positive- to negative-energy solutions and Klein's paradox never comes into play. There are no scattering states when k1 = 0, but for k1  ≠  0 the continuum states are those ones which have energies beyond the limits expressed by ([\ref=limit_values_k1_p])-([\ref=limit_values_k1_n]), for which K  ≤  0. As far as the chiral transformation is concerned, one can note that γ5 acts much in the same way as the charge-conjugation transformation, except that it does not change the sign of the energy and changes the mass sign. Therefore, the chiral transformation connects solutions with the same energy sign but that have opposite k2 signs.

When k2 = 0, i.e., no pseudoscalar potential, there is no isolated bounded solutions and the quantization condition expressed by Eq. ([\ref=eigen_eq_Delta=0]) takes the form

[formula]

where [formula] stands for the sign function. This means that when k1 > 0 there are only bound states for fermions with E > mc2 and those bounded solutions are kept apart from the negative-energy continuum (E <  - mc2) by an energy gap greater than 2mc2. On the other hand, for k1 < 0 there are only bound states for antifermions with E <  - mc2 and those bounded solutions also do not mix with continuum states with E >  - mc2. Therefore, the positive-energy bound states of fermions never sink into the Dirac sea of negative energies, and the negative-energy bound states of antifermions never reach the upper continuum, so again there is no danger of reaching the conditions for Klein's paradox. It is important to note that the solutions with k1 < 0 are not the antiparticles of the solutions with k1 > 0 because charge conjugation changes Σ into -  Δ and vice-versa. This means that the antiparticles of the states with [formula] and k1 > 0 are the negative-energy solutions of the relativistic system with [formula], with k1 positive.

To conclude, let us present, as an example of the rule stated at the beginning of the section, the eigenvalue equation for the relativistic harmonic oscillator when [formula]:

[formula]

Here ñ is the number of nodes (the degree of the Hermite polynomial) for the lower component, since the chiral transformation interchanges the upper and lower components, so that the second-order equation to solve in this case is the one for the lower component, Eq. ([\ref=2_order_Sigma=0_psi-]). The upper component would be obtained from the corresponding first-order equation Eq. ([\ref=psi+_Sigma=0]). As a final remark, one may note that for massless particles, the Δ = 0 and Σ = 0 oscillators have the same spectrum with the sign of k2 reversed.

In 3+1 dimensions the corresponding eigenvalue equations to Eqs. ([\ref=eigen_eq_Delta=0]) and ([\ref=eigen_eq_Sigma=0]) have a very similar structure. From [\cite=nosso] we see that, for Δ = 0, one just adds the Dirac equation quantum number κ to the coefficient of k2 and modifies the coefficient of the square root to include the orbital angular momentum l of the upper component

[formula]

while for Σ = 0 one uses the orbital angular momentum [formula] of the lower component

[formula]

where  =  - κ (see [\cite=nosso]). If we compare these equations with ([\ref=eigen_eq_Delta=0]) and ([\ref=eigen_eq_Sigma=0]), we see that the main features are identical, and thus all the main results obtained in the next section remain valid for the relativistic harmonic oscillator in three spatial dimensions.

Graphical determination of the energy levels

We turn now to the solutions of Eq. ([\ref=eigen_eq_Delta=0]). In order to obtain a deeper insight on those solutions for arbitrary k1 and k2 one has to seek a convenient method for solving this transcendental equation. If we square Eq. ([\ref=eigen_eq_Delta=0]) the resulting equation is in general a quartic algebraic equation in E, which in principle can be solved analytically. The price paid is that some spurious roots can appear in this process, although, of course, these can be eliminated by checking whether they satisfy the original equation. A more instructive procedure is follow a graphical method, by which one seeks the intersection points of the functions of energy in Eq. ([\ref=eigen_eq_Delta=0]): a parabola on the left-hand side

[formula]

and a square-root function on the right-hand side

[formula]

In this way, it is easy to see that there are at most two acceptable solutions of ([\ref=eigen_eq_Delta=0]), since the parabola and the square-root function can have at most two intersection points. The construction of the graph of fs(E) is split into three distinct classes depending on the k1 values. Below we discuss these three classes of problems. It should not be forgotten, though, that the solutions with E =  - mc2 are not included in this discussion, since they correspond to isolated solutions for k2 > 0.

This kind of analysis and the conclusions that will be drawn from it in the following subsections can be applied with appropriate modifications to the 3+1 case, and therefore to nucleon and antinucleon single-particle spectra. This is especially true as far the relations between the spectra of systems with Δ = 0 and Σ = 0 are concerned, since these are obtained from the general properties of charge-conjugation and γ5 transformations which hold in 3+1 dimensions.

The case k1 = 0

Although we have already solved this case, it is presented here for the sake of completeness. For k1 = 0, fs(E) is just a nonnegative constant function as can be seen from Eq. ([\ref=energy_eigen_k1=0]), having two symmetric intersections with the parabola.

Fig. [\ref=Fig1] and Fig. [\ref=Fig2] present the results for the first four quantum numbers. In these and the following plots we use the scaled quantities e = E / (mc2), κ1  =  2k1 / (m3c4) and κ2  =  2 / (m2c3). The first shows how the values of the energy are obtained from the intersection of the two curves and the second how the eigenvalues vary with k2. The energies for the zero mass case can also be computed from the intersections with the dashed parabola in Fig. [\ref=Fig1]. From these figures it is clear the symmetry of the energy levels. Note again that the isolated solution is not plotted.

The case k1 > 0

When k1 > 0, fs(E) is a monotonically increasing function of E. For each n, it can intersect the parabola at one or two points, depending on the particular values of k1 and k2. To determine the conditions for this to occur, we have first to determine the minimum of fs(E), which occurs when the expression under the square root in ([\ref=def_f_s]) is zero:

[formula]

This value sets a lower bound for the energies of all the solutions of Eq. ([\ref=eigen_eq_Delta=0]). For E = Emin, the function fs(E) takes the value

[formula]

and fp takes the value

[formula]

When k1 > 0, the minimum of fs(E) occurs for negative values of the energy, that is, on the left (and decreasing) side of the parabola. If fpmin  < fsmin  there is only one solution of Eq. ([\ref=eigen_eq_Delta=0]) and it has positive energy. From ([\ref=f_s_min]), this can happen only for k2 > 0, since fpmin  > 0. If fsmin   ≤  fpmin  there are always two solutions, one negative and one positive, because [formula] is always positive, no matter how large is |k2|, for a positive k1. Furthermore, the positive and negative solutions are such that |E| > mc2, since, when |E| < mc2, fs(E) > fp(E) and thus there are no solutions. Note, however, that for n = 0 and k2 negative there is a solution with E =  - mc2, but this is an isolated solution out of the Sturm-Liouville problem we are considering.

The considerations of the previous paragraph can be further elaborated by analyzing the behavior of the function F(k2)

[formula]

According to what was stated in the previous paragraph, if F(k2) > 0 one has two solutions for each n, and if F(k2) < 0 there is just one solution for each n. To determine the signs of F(k2) for each value of k2, we will need to know the values of k2 which are roots of F(k2) = 0, or of the equation

[formula]

excluding the solution k2 = 0. Applying Descartes' rule of signs to this last equation, we see that it can only have a positive real solution. The rule states that the number of positive real roots nr of an algebraic equation with real coefficients

[formula]

is never greater than the number of changes of signs nc in the sequence [formula] (not counting the null coefficients) and, if less, then differs from nc by an even number. This means that nr can take the values [formula], [formula] . In this case, for positive k1, there is only one such sign change and therefore there is only a positive and unique solution, which we shall call k*2. The function F(k2) changes sign at k2 = 0 and k2 = k*2, being negative in the interval 0 < k2 < k*2 and positive outside this interval. Therefore, according to what we have said before, there is only one positive-energy solution when 0 < k2 < k*2 and two solutions (one positive and one negative) when k2 < 0 or k2  ≥  k*2. If k2 = 0, the two functions intersect at Emin  =  - mc2, but again, since this solution was excluded from the Sturm-Liouville problem leading to the eigenvalue equation ([\ref=eigen_eq_Delta=0]), we consider only the harmonic oscillator solutions with energy greater than mc2.

The graphical representations of fp and fs are shown in Fig. [\ref=Fig3] for m  ≠  0. We plot the square-root function for three values of κ2 (the scaled k2), for a positive k1. We plot fs(E) with n = 0 for κ2 = 0,  0.6 and with n = 0 and n = 1 for κ2 =  - 0.6. The value of κ1 was chosen such that F(k2) has a positive value for κ2 = 0.6. There is always an infinite and unbounded set of positive-energy states with E > mc2 for any value of k2, and there are always negative states when k2 is negative. Note that increasing the value of n does not change qualitatively these features, as can be seen from the plots of fs(E) when k2 is negative.

In Fig. [\ref=Fig4] it is clearly seen that for values of k2 between zero and k*2 there are only positive-energy solutions. Moreover, one can see from Eq. ([\ref=fs_min=fp_min]) that the value of k*2 increases with k1, meaning that when k1  ≫  |k2| one reaches the limit of the harmonic oscillator (k1 > 0, k2 = 0) where there are only positive bound-state solutions with E > mc2. Thus, the existence of the pseudoscalar potential gives rise to negative-energy solutions coming from the Dirac sea. For k2 < 0 these kind of solutions always exist. We excluded the isolated level with n = 0 for negative k2. Note also that for decreasing negative k2 the positive-energy solution for n = 0 goes to E = mc2, which was the case we discarded in the discussion of the Dirac oscillator in the previous section. When k2 = k*2 there is an infinite set of degenerate solutions with E = Emin, because in this case the intersection point of fs(E) with the negative-energy branch of fp(E) is the initial (minimum) point of the square-root function, which of course does not change with n (see Fig. [\ref=Fig3]). However, when E = Emin, the value of K defined in ([\ref=def_K]) is zero, and thus, from ([\ref=def_lambda]), λ = 0 and therefore these solutions do not correspond to bound states (see Eqs. ([\ref=psi+_Delta=0_OH]) and ([\ref=psi-_Delta=0_OH])). For [formula] the degeneracy is removed and we have a very high density of very delocalized states (since [formula]) which then decreases with increasing k2. In Fig. [\ref=Fig4] we also plotted the parabola - mc2 - 2k22 / k1 (in scaled units - 1 - 2κ22  /  κ1) which corresponds to the asymptotic values of the negative-energy states when n  →    ∞   and thus represents the set of lower energy bounds of the negative-energy solutions for each pair of k1 and k2 values. This parabola can be also seen as delimiting the region in the energy-k2 plane in which K  ≤  0, i.e., where there are no bound-state solutions. This is related to the discussion in the previous section leading to Eqs. ([\ref=limit_values_k1_p]) and ([\ref=limit_values_k1_n]).

As referred before, for a given energy E <  - mc2 and positive k1 there are not bound states for values of k2 in the interval [formula]. In fact, from what was said above in this section, one can be more precise and state that there are no negative bound states for 0 < k2  <  k*2. Since k*2 is zero when k1 = 0 and increases with increasing k1, this means that when k1 = 0 (the Dirac oscillator) there are no continuum states and when k1  →    ∞   (or when k2  →  0), all the negative-energy states are continuum states.

The case k1 < 0

For k1 < 0 the function fs(E) decreases monotonically with the energy, reaching again its minimum when the expression under the square root in ([\ref=def_f_s]) is zero, setting now a maximum value for the energy of the solutions of Eq. ([\ref=eigen_eq_Delta=0]). The expressions for Emax , fsmin  = fs(Emax ) and fpmin  = fp(Emax ) are the same as corresponding ones in the previous subsection, respectively Eqs. ([\ref=E_min]), ([\ref=f_s_min]) and ([\ref=f_p_min]), except that, of course, now k1 is negative.

Noting that fs at E =  - mc2 has a nonnegative value given by fs( - mc2) = (2n + 1)2| + k2, we see that there is always an infinite and unbounded set of negative-energy solutions (one for each n) with E <  - mc2. For n = 0 and k2  ≤  0, there is a solution with E =  - mc2 which was already discussed in the previous section. However, when k1 < 0, one can solve Eq. ([\ref=isol_sol_Delta=0]) when E =  - mc2 and obtain a bound-state solution with both upper and lower components different from zero, if and only if κ2  =  κ1 / 8. One can show that this corresponds to a n = 0 solution given by the functions ([\ref=psi+_Delta=0_OH]) and ([\ref=psi-_Delta=0_OH]) taking the limit E  →   - mc2.

In addition to that set of solutions, there can be another set of solutions only if the function F(k2) (see Eq. [\ref=def_F(k2)]) is zero or positive, as explained before. To determine the values of k2 for which this happens, one has to compute the roots [formula] of F(k2) = 0. When k1 < 0, Descartes' rule of signs applied to F(k2) = 0 states that one can have a positive root and two or zero negative roots (this is done by changing z  →   - z in ([\ref=Descartes_rule])), in addition to, of course, the root [formula]. The two negative roots arise for a value of k1 = kc1 such that [formula]. In scaled units, this value is κc1 =  - 64 / 27, corresponding to the double negative root [formula]. For κ1  <  κc1 there is only a positive root, while for κc1  ≤  κ1 < 0 there are two negative roots and a positive root. Because F(k2) changes sign at [formula] (except when [formula] is a double root) and F(k2) is always positive when |k2|  →    ∞  , this means that when κ1  <  κc1 there is only one range of values of k2 where F(k2) < 0 whereas when κ1  >  κc1 there are two ranges of k2 values where this happens. Within these ranges, only negative-energy solutions exist. When κ1  =  κc1, the value [formula] corresponds to an infinite set of degenerate negative-energy solutions with scaled energy [formula], which, as mentioned before, are not bound-state solutions. These features of the spectrum can be seen in Figs. [\ref=Fig5] and [\ref=Fig6].

In Fig. [\ref=Fig5] the solutions with - mc2 < E < 0 with [formula] are basically degenerate (they follow closely the parabola - 1 - 2κ22  /  κ1) and the n = 0 solution is very close to them. Since, as remarked before, on the parabola the value of K is zero, these are very weakly bounded solutions. Note that the n = 0 positive-energy solution with E < mc2 goes to mc2 when k2  →    -    ∞  , thus becoming the isolated solution of the Dirac oscillator (k1 = 0). This can also be seen in Fig. [\ref=Fig6], where one may also remark that there is a value of κ2 around - 0.9 for which the solutions for distinct values of n and - mc2 < E < 0 are almost degenerate. This point corresponds to the local minimum of F(k2), which, for κ1 =  - 3, is very close to the double root κ*2 =  - 8 / 9. Similarly as in the case of k1 > 0, the solutions with [formula] have infinite degeneracy, but they do not correspond to bounded solutions. Again, for k2 near k*2 there is a high density of very delocalized states. The parabola - 1 - 2κ22  /  κ1 sets now an upper bound (n  →    ∞  ) for the positive-energy states.

The limits k2  →  0 and |k2|  →    ∞   correspond, respectively, to the harmonic oscillator solutions for negative-energy (antiparticle) states and to the Dirac oscillator. In the first case there are no bound states for particles (positive-energy states). As |k2| increases, positive bound states start to appear.

Variation with k1 for k2 fixed

To complete the study of solutions of equation ([\ref=eigen_eq_Delta=0]) we present now a plot of its solutions when k2 is kept fixed and let k1 vary. Note that the existence of one or two solutions is governed by the sign of the function

[formula]

identical with F(k2), except that now k2 acts as a parameter and k1 is the variable. The critical value is now κc2 =  - 1. In Fig. [\ref=Fig7] we present a plot of the solutions for k2 > 0, when there are two possible values for k*1, the roots of G(k1) = 0. Apart the factor 4k2 / k21, this is just a quadratic equation in k1, so that it is easily shown that when κ2  ≤   - 1 it has no real solutions. This means that, since in this case G(k1)  ≥  0, there are always two sets of solutions. Note that now the points in the energy-k1 plane for which K = 0 are on the hyperbole - 1 - 2k22 / k1, such that only in the region between the hyperbole branches, where K is positive, bound states may exist.

As before, we can recognize the Dirac oscillator and the harmonic oscillator limits, as one sets k1 = 0 and |k1|  →    ∞  , respectively. In this last case, one has the harmonic oscillator solutions for particles or antiparticles depending whether k1 goes to +    ∞   or -    ∞  . One can again see that the energy levels of the Dirac oscillator are symmetric about E = 0 and that there are no scattering states. Here this follows simply from the fact that k1 = 0 is an asymptote of the hyperbole branches which separate the continuum region from the bound-state region.

Solutions from symmetry arguments

As referred before, the case Σ = 0 can be obtained from the Δ = 0 case by applying the charge-conjugation transformation. We recall that this transformation performs the changes E  →   - E, Δ  →    -  Σ and Vp  →   - Vp, or, for harmonic oscillator potentials, the changes k1  →   - k1 and k2  →   - k2. This can be seen if we solve the eigenvalue equation for Σ = 0, Eq. ([\ref=eigen_eq_Sigma=0]), for κ1 = 1 and plot the solutions for several values of κ2. The result is shown in Fig. [\ref=Fig8].

If we compare this figure with Fig. [\ref=Fig5] (κ1 =  - 1) we see that the plots are identical if we reverse both the vertical and horizontal axes, i.e, if we reverse the sign of the energy and of k2, respectively. Of course, the identification of the particle and antiparticle levels is also reversed, as it should be, since we are applying the charge-conjugation transformation.

The existence of both positive- and negative-energy solutions in a system with Σ = 0 can be relevant for nuclei. In the 3+1 Dirac equation of relativistic nuclear mean-field theories there is a connection between the (isoscalar) vector and tensor potential. The latter is proportional to the derivative of the former [\cite=nosso2]. For the harmonic oscillator potentials used in this paper, this would give, using the notation of Ref. [\cite=nosso2], the relation

[formula]

The constant fv can take values up to around 1.3 in nuclei using relativistic mean-field potentials of Woods-Saxon type [\cite=nosso2]. For harmonic oscillator mean-field potentials, there should be also an upper value for fv, and therefore the relation ([\ref=k_2_k_1_f_v]) sets a maximum for κ2 in nuclei. As was seen above, this is relevant to know whether there can be simultaneously nucleon and antinucleon bound states in nuclei. This would depend very much on the strength of the Δ potential, which is given by k1. As is apparent from Fig. [\ref=Fig8], for small values of the scaled k1, κ1, the maximum value of κ2 allowed by Eq. ([\ref=k_2_k_1_f_v]) could be such that there would exist only positive-energy states. On the other hand, for stronger Δ potentials, the relation ([\ref=k_2_k_1_f_v]) could allow both positive- and negative-energy bound states, as can be seen by applying the axis reversal described above to the Δ = 0 spectrum shown in Fig. [\ref=Fig6].

In Sec. [\ref=Sec:rel_h_oscillator] we have seen that the γ5 chiral transformation can also be used to get formally Σ = 0 from Δ = 0 solutions, involving, however, the unphysical transformation m  →   - m. This objection is overcome when we deal with ultrarelativistic particles, for which we may consider m  ~  0. In this case, the chiral transformation relates massless physical states with Δ = 0,  Σ = V and a pseudoscalar potential Vp to massless states with Σ = 0,  Δ = V and - Vp, where V can be an arbitrary potential. For harmonic oscillator potentials, one has Σ = k1x2 / 2    →    Δ = k1x2 / 2 and k2  →   - k2. Since, as explained in Sec. [\ref=Sec:rel_h_oscillator], the chiral transformation does not change the equations of motion, the energy of their solutions is not changed. This can be seen in Figs. [\ref=Fig9] and [\ref=Fig10], where are plotted, respectively, the solutions of the Δ = 0 and Σ = 0 eigenvalue equations, Eqs. ([\ref=eigen_eq_Delta=0]) and ([\ref=eigen_eq_Sigma=0]), when m = 0, for κ = 1 and several k2 values. The basic features of these plots were already discussed in the previous section. As before, the E = 0 isolated solution was excluded. We see that the spectra are the same apart from the k2  →   - k2 change, which shows up as a reversal of the horizontal axis. For k2 = 0, the pure harmonic oscillator solution, both spectra are identical, with no negative-energy solutions and, of course, no nonrelativistic limit. Note, however, that the Δ = 0 and Σ = 0 energy eigenstates are not the same, since γ5 interchanges the upper and lower components. This amounts to say that these states are not eigenstates of γ5, which of course they could not be, since, because of Vs, it does not commute with the Hamiltonian ([\ref=hamiltonian_d_sigma_delta]) even with m = 0 and Vp = 0. If Vs would be zero, then, because one has either Δ = 0 or Σ = 0, Vt would have also to be zero, and we would have a free ultrarelativistic particle, which has a good chirality, i.e., is an eigenstate of γ5.

Conclusions

In this work we studied the solutions of 1+1 Dirac equation with a potential with the most general Lorentz structure which leads to harmonic oscillator potentials in the second-order differential equation for the spinor components. This is achieved when the vector Vt and scalar Vs potentials are quadratic and satisfy either Δ = Vt - Vs = 0 or Σ = Vt + Vs = 0, and the pseudoscalar potential is linear. We showed that there are no bound-state solutions in the nonrelativistic limit for Σ = 0 and Vp very small, meaning in this case we have an intrinsic relativistic problem.

We analyzed in great detail, by use of a graphical procedure, the solutions of the transcendental eigenvalue equation in the case of Δ = 0, for all signs of the potentials and for both particle and antiparticle states. As referred in the Introduction, there is an increasing interest in studying the behavior of antinucleon in nuclei, and in particular how well pseudospin and spin symmetries hold for nucleons and antinucleons respectively.

We discussed in detail the isolated solutions, i.e., solutions out of the Sturm-Liouville problem, as well as the critical points in the parameter space of k1 and k2, the coefficients of the quadratic and linear potentials. Near these points there is a high density of bounded states which are very extended in space. These critical points are also relevant to determine which values of k1 and k2 allow to have a spectrum of both fermion and antifermion bounded solutions simultaneously or just one of these kind of solutions. We established a connection to 3+1 dimensional relativistic oscillator harmonic potentials applied to nuclei, where there is a relation between those coefficients and concluded that, for a sufficiently strong Δ potential, both kinds of solutions (i.e, for both nucleons and antinucleons) can coexist.

We showed how to obtain the solutions for Σ = 0 from the Δ = 0 case, using the charge-conjugation and chiral transformations. In particular, we used the chiral transformation to show that, for massless fermions and zero pseudoscalar potential, the Δ = 0 and Σ = 0 solutions have the same spectrum. These conclusions are quite general and do not depend on the number of dimensions so that they remain true in 3+1 dimensions. Also, most of the features of the 1+1 spectra presented in this work are also present in the 3+1 relativistic harmonic oscillator. Indeed, since the 1+1 eigenvalue equations for Δ = 0 and Σ = 0 are very similar to the corresponding 3+1 equations, we can apply the same graphical methods to the 3+1 case, and therefore most of the analysis of the 1+1 case remains true with appropriate changes. For instance, the shape of the parabola in the energy-k2 plane related to Emin would depend now on the value of the spin-orbit quantum number κ. The function F(k2) would also depend on κ, and therefore the roots k*2 and critical value kc2 would also depend on κ. For k2 = 0 there would be the known harmonic oscillator 2n + l degeneracy, produced by the U(3) symmetry studied very recently by Ginocchio [\cite=gin6] in connection to spin and isospin symmetry.

Finally, the chiral transformation enables us to switch between the so-called pseudospin (Σ = 0 and Vp = 0) and spin symmetries (Δ = 0 and Vp = 0) [\cite=bell] [\cite=gin5] for any potential. In the context of a study of the symmetries of a 3-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator, Ginocchio already showed that one can transform the generators of the SU(2) spin symmetry into the pseudospin generators by a γ5 transformation [\cite=gin6]. We showed that this transformation allows us to relate the Δ = 0,  Σ = V and Σ = 0,  Δ = V problems for any potential V, and, for massless fermions and zero pseudoscalar potential, also to conclude that the two energy spectra are the same.
