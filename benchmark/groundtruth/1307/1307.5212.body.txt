TESTS OF LORENTZ INVARIANCE USING HIGH-ENERGY ASTROPHYSICS OBSERVATIONS

Everything that is not forbidden is compulsory. -- Murray Gell-Mann

Introduction

Colladay and Kostelecký[\cite=ck98] proposed an effective field theory framework for quantifying and cataloging the empirical effects of small violations of CPT and Lorentz invariance known as the Standard-Model Extension (SME). The SME is based on the introduction of small Lorentz and CPT violating perturbations in the individual free particle Lagrangians. Coleman and Glashow[\cite=co99] have presented a simplified formalism, assuming rotational invariance, wherein particle interactions that violate Lorentz invariance can be modified in terms of the maximum attainable velocities (MAV) of the various particles involved. Thus superluminal particle velocities can be directly related to Lorentz invariance violation. This in turn can lead to the allowance or prohibition of various particle interactions.

Why high-energy astrophysics observations?

Lorentz invariance implies scale-free spacetime. The group of Lorentz boosts is unbounded. Very large boosts probe physics at ultrashort distance intervals λ. To probe physics at these distance intervals, particularly the nature of space and time, we need to go to ultrahigh energies E  =  1 / λ. Cosmic γ-rays and cosmic rays provide the highest observable energies in the Universe. Physics at the Planck scale of [formula] m, e.g., quantum gravity, may involve a fundamental length scale. That, in itself, violates Lorentz invariance. Some frameworks for considering Lorentz invariance violation include effective field theory such as SME, deformed special relativity, stochastic spacetime foam, loop quantum gravity, string inspired models (D-branes), and emergent spacetime theories[\cite=dm05]. I will discuss some particular astrophysical tests of Lorentz invariance violation and limits on MAV.

Limits from photons and electrons

I follow the well-defined formalism for Lorentz invariance breaking discussed in Ref. . Within this scenario, the MAV of an electron need not equal the in vacuo velocity of light, i.e., ce  ≠  cγ. The physical consequences of this violation of Lorentz invariance depend on the sign of the difference. I define the parameter [formula] as the difference between the MAVs of particles i and j.

Direct limits

Direct limits on δeγ follow from the observation of 2 TeV cosmic-ray electrons and 50 TeV γ-rays from the Crab Nebula[\cite=co99] [\cite=sg01]. These limits are δeγ  <  1.3  ×  10- 13 and -  δeγ  <  2  ×  10- 16.

Threshold for annihilation of γ-rays

If δeγ  >  0 the threshold energy for the pair production process γ  +  γ  →  e+  +  e- is altered because the square of the four-momentum becomes

[formula]

The Mrk 501 γ-ray spectrum of a strong flare the nearby blazer Mrk 501 above ~  20 TeV can be understood as a result of expected intergalactic absorption by pair production. It follows that δeγ  ≤  2(me / Eγ)2  =  1.3  ×  10- 15[\cite=sg01].

Time of flight for photons from γ-ray bursts

The Large Area Telescope aboard the Fermi satellite has placed direct time-of-flight limits on the energy dependence of photon velocity.[\cite=vl13]. This limit rules out the simple E / MPlanck dependence for photon retardation as predicted in some quantum gravity scenarios[\cite=el].

Vacuum birefringence

Then, using the reported detection of polarized soft γ-ray emission from the γ-ray burst GRB041219a that is indicative of an absence of vacuum birefringence, together with a very recent improved method for estimating the redshift of the burst, I have derived strong constraints on the dimension-5 Lorentz invariance violation term

[formula]

I obtain an upper limit on |ξ| of 2.4  ×  10- 15, corresponding to a constraint on the dimension-5 SME coefficient k(5)(V)00  ≤  4.2  ×  10- 34 GeV- 1[\cite=st11]. It also gives a directional frame independent constraint in terms of the SME coefficients of

[formula]

Other directional constraints from various γ-ray bursts have recently been derived[\cite=ko13].

Synchrotron emission from the Crab nebula

Synchrotron γ-rays from the strong April 2011 Crab Nebula flare were observed by the Large Area Telescope on Fermi up to an energy ~  400 MeV [\cite=ab11]. This places an upper limit on δeγ of 6  ×  10- 20[\cite=st13]. This equals the limit on the SME parameter - ceTT.

Limits from neutrinos

The observation of two PeV-scale neutrino events reported by Ice Cube[\cite=aa13] can, in principle, allow one to place constraints on Lorentz invariance violation in the neutrino sector. This observation implies an upper limit on δνe of [formula]. Combined with the best limit on δeγ given in Section 3.5, this gives an upper limit on δνγ of [formula][\cite=st13]. This equals the limit on the SME parameter [formula]

Limits from hadrons

Owing to the GZK effect[\cite=gr66] [\cite=za66], protons with energies above 100 EeV should be attenuated from distances beyond ~  100 Mpc because they interact with the CBR photons with a resonant photoproduction of pions[\cite=st68]. The threshold energy for this reaction is changed by 2δπpE2π. This leads to an upper limit δπp  ≤  3.23  ×  10- 24(ω  /  ω0)2 where ω0  =  kTCMB  =  2.35  ×  10- 4 eV with TCMB  =  2.725  ±  0.02 K[\cite=co99]. By comparing the observed spectrum of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays with the predicted modification from Lorentz invariance violation an extremely low upper limit on δπp of 4.5  ×  10- 23 is obtained[\cite=ss09].

Conclusion

Presently, we have no positive evidence for modifying special relativity at even the highest energies observed. Theoretical models involving Planck scale physics and quantum gravity need to meet all of the present observational constraints.
