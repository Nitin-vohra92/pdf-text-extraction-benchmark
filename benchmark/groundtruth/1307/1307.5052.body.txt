Introduction

Neutron stars in binary systems accrete matter either from stellar winds [\citep=ostriker73] or from Roche lobe overflow [\citep=ghosh77] [\citep=romanova02] [\citep=romanova03] of the companion. The matter is channelled by the magnetic field to the poles, forming accretion mounds. Radiation from such mounds and the overlying columns gives rise to the pulsating X-ray emission observed due to the rotation of the neutron star (e.g. see [\citet=patruno12] and [\citet=caballero12] for some examples of accretion powered X-ray pulsars).

The pressure of the confined accreted matter distorts the local magnetic field [\citep=hameury83] [\citep=melatos01] [\citep=melatos04] [\citep=dipanjan12] with important consequences for the X-ray emission from the mounds and secular evolution of the neutron star's magnetic field. For high mass X-ray binary systems (hereafter HMXB) with companion masses [formula], the accreted matter confined within a polar cap of radius ~  1km generates strong broad band X-ray emission with characteristic cyclotron resonance scattering features (hereafter CRSF) (see [\citet=coburn02] [\citet=heindl04] for a review). Superposition of spectra from different parts of the mound with strong local distortions in the field lines would tend to make the CRSF structure broad and complex [\citep=dipanjan12] (hereafter MB12). The observed broadening of CRSF at lower luminosity, e.g. in V0332+53 [\citep=tsygankov10], may be due to larger field distortions closer to the mound.

Over long term, the accreted matter would eventually flow horizontally along the neutron star surface. It has been proposed by various authors [\citep=romani90] [\citep=young95] [\citep=cumming01] [\citep=melatos01] [\citep=melatos04] that such material flow may drag the field and bury it, leading to the relatively lower fields (~  108 - 109G) of neutron stars in low mass X-ray binaries (hereafter LMXB) as compared to the ~  1012G fields in younger HMXB systems. However, plasma instabilities may disrupt such a burial processes by enabling cross-field transport of matter. Gravity driven modes may be triggered inside the accretion mound [\citep=cumming01] resulting in the formation of closed disconnected loops [\citep=melatos04] [\citep=dipanjan12] [\citep=dipanjan13a]. Such mounds are also prone to pressure driven instabilities [\citep=litwin01], as is common in systems like tokamaks where highly curved magnetic fields confine internal plasma (see [\citet=friedberg82] for a review of MHD instabilities in such systems).

In this work we explore the MHD instabilities in accretion mounds strictly contained inside a polar cap of radius ~  1km on a neutron star of surface field ~  1012G. This is appropriate for accretion mounds formed on HMXB and young LMXB with high magnetic field. The effects of gravity driven modes in such systems have been explored in [\citet=dipanjan13a] (hereafter MBM13) via 2D axisymmetric simulations. In this paper we extend the work of MB12 and MBM13 to perform perturbation analysis in full 3D setting via MHD simulations.

This paper is organised as follows: i) in Sec. [\ref=Num.setup] we describe the equations solved to obtain the equilibrium structure of the mound which is subsequently perturbed and evolved to perform the MHD simulations, ii) in Sec. [\ref=Sec.results] we describe the results of the simulations for mounds of different sizes and structure. We show that higher mass mounds with large field distortions are highly unstable whereas mounds of smaller mass have slower growth rates tending to a stability threshold. iii) In Sec. [\ref=Sec.discuss] we discuss the implications of the MHD instabilities on a) the long term field evolution in such systems, b) the spectra and CRSF from mounds on HMXB systems and c) the timing features expected from such mounds.

Numerical set up

The analytical and numerical techniques employed to obtain the equilibrium solution of the mound structure have already been discussed in detail in MB12 and MBM13. In this section we briefly summarise the steps and discuss the differences between the 2D and 3D simulations. Following MB12, we first solve for the equilibrium field configuration of the static mound by solving a Grad-Shafranov (hereafter GS) equation in cylindrical coordinate system:

[formula]

where the GS operator is defined as: [formula]. The flux function ψ is related to the poloidal magnetic field as [formula]. We assume zero toroidal magnetic field. We consider a degenerate non-relativistic plasma (with μe = 2) whose pressure is given by

[formula]

ρ being the density in g cm- 3. We assume Newtonian gravity with constant acceleration g = 1.86  ×  1014- 2 for a neutron star of radius 10km and mass [formula]. As in MBM13, we use a GS solution for a polar field [formula], with B0 = 1012G at the surface. The shape of the mound is defined by the mound height function Z0(ψ) (see MB12 for more on the mound height function). Following MBM13, for a filled mound, we consider the profile

[formula]

and for a hollow mound we use

[formula]

where ψ̃  =  ψ  /  ψp, ψp  =  1 / 2(B0R2p) is the flux function at the polar cap radius Rp = 1km. The apex height is given by Zc which for a filled mound is at r = 0 and for a hollow mound at r(ψ̃ = 0.5).

The equilibrium solutions from the GS solver are used as initial conditions in the PLUTO MHD code [\citep=andrea07]. The PLUTO code solves the full set of ideal MHD equations following the Godunov scheme (e.g. MBM13, [\citet=andrea07]). As the density falls off to zero beyond the mound height, we choose a section of the GS solution as the PLUTO domain (as in MBM13), such that local Alfvén speeds are non-relativistic. The 2D axisymmetric GS solutions carried out over a polar plane (r - z) are rotated in the azimuthal direction to construct the 3D mound in force equilibrium. The GS solutions are then imported into PLUTO by a trilinear interpolation scheme. The simulation is carried out in [formula] domain in the azimuthal direction with periodic boundary condition at both ends. Although this does impose an assumed symmetry of a quarter of a quadrant, the results are qualitatively similar to that of a full azimuthal domain

Results

Toroidal mode instabilities in filled mounds

Non-axisymmetric structures: For a mound near the GS threshold (Zc  =  70m following eq. ([\ref=parabolicpro]), with Bp = 1012G), applied perturbations easily excite MHD instabilities resulting in the growth of toroidal modes. At the onset of the instability, several radial finger like channels are formed which later merge to form random over and under-dense regions (see Fig. [\ref=density_slices_70m]). To investigate the structures developed by the toroidal modes we perform one dimensional discrete Fourier transform along the azimuthal direction at certain fixed values of time, radius and height:

[formula]

where Q is any physical parameter (e.g. density) and [formula] is its Fourier transform, φl = lπ / (2Nθ) is the azimuthal coordinate and Nθ is the total number of cells in the azimuthal direction. The corresponding frequencies in the Fourier domain are un  =  n / (π / 2). Using the above in eq. ([\ref=eqFT]), we get the power spectral density (PSD) as

[formula]

where m = 4n can be identified as the mode number for Fourier modes over the whole domain of

[formula]

for a smaller evolution time and compared them with single quadrant simulations. The results are qualitatively similar in both cases with similar nature of the growth of the instabilities (see Fig. [\ref=fullrho] for normalised density at ~  1tA). It is seen that the PSD of the physical parameters (e.g. density) at different heights and radii are very similar for both cases (see Fig. [\ref=PSDcompare] for a comparison at t  ~  0.25tA), indicating that the results of our simulations are not significantly affected by constraining the domain to

[formula]

domain of the azimuthal angle.

Resolution dependence: We have performed the simulation at different resolutions to check for convergence. At higher resolutions more internal structures are resolved. As cross field diffusion is reduced, field lines are deformed at earlier times due to internal flows. Thus higher resolutions result in faster onset of the instabilities, which has also been demonstrated for 2D simulations in MBM13. However, we have found that for grids with spatial resolutions ≤  1m, the results of the MHD instabilities are qualitatively similar. In Fig. [\ref=rhorescompare] the density at t  ~  0.75tA and z  ~  25m is plotted for three different resolutions (Nr  ×  Nθ  ×  Nz): 256  ×  384  ×  24, 512  ×  768  ×  48 and 1024  ×  1536  ×  96 respectively. It is seen that for the simulation with radial grid size Nr = 256 the radial structures have not developed yet whereas for the simulations with Nr = 512 and Nr = 1024 the toroidal modes have fully developed and reached the non-linear saturation phase. The time evolution of the gravitational potential energy at different resolutions are compared in Fig. [\ref=gravcompare] (other energy components behave similarly). There is a tendency for the energy curves to converge at higher resolution. It can be seen that the runs with Nr = 512 and Nr = 1024 resemble each other better than that with Nr = 256. Thus further simulations were performed with the resolution set to 512  ×  768  ×  48, which corresponds to a spatial resolution of ~  1m at the centre of the domain. Similar resolution settings have been adopted for mounds of different sizes.

Mounds of medium size : threshold of stability

Mounds of smaller mass with less field distortion display slower growth of instabilities. For mounds near the GS threshold (e.g. Zc  ~  70m and 65m) the instability onset time is tinst  ~  0.3tA and ~  3.5tA respectively, whereas for smaller mounds it is larger e.g. tinst  ~  1.1tA for Zc = 55m and ~  2.5tA for Zc = 50m (see Fig. [\ref=multimounden]). For a 50m mound, the density initially settles in stationary pockets of lower field strength (see Fig. [\ref=50mrhobmag]). The initially formed filaments remain stationary till ~  2.5tA after which the instability starts to spread throughout the mound with a corresponding change in the energy components (see Fig. [\ref=multimounden] for magnetic energy plot).

For a Zc = 45m mound, MHD instabilities do not grow during the run time of the simulation. The perturbed mound quickly settles into a steady state after some initial oscillations (see Fig. [\ref=45mben]). Thus with decrease in mound mass, the system tends to become stable. This agrees with the results of [\citet=litwin01] which predicts that accretion mounds are unstable only if plasma β  =  p / (B2 / 8π) is higher than a threshold value. As shown in the discussion of MBM13, the maximum plasma β for a Zc = 45m mound is very close to such a threshold. This confirms that filled mounds of central height lower than ~  45m may be stable with respect to pressure driven ballooning instabilities.

Hollow mound

As discussed in MBM13, a finite range of the mass loading region in the accretion disc will result in the formation of hollow ring-like accretion mounds on the neutron star surface. The GS solutions and results from 2D perturbation tests have already been discussed in MBM13. Here we perform 3D perturbation tests of GS solutions of such mounds (eq. ([\ref=holopro]) with zc  =  45m). As in filled mounds, multiple radial streams appear at the outer edge. The instabilities saturate by about ~  2tA, as is evident from the flattening of the energy curves after initial changes (see Fig. [\ref=holoen]). However, unlike in filled mounds, radial streams also appear at the inner boundary (see Fig. [\ref=holoslices]), which is characterised by a second dip in the internal energy at ~  5tA. The toroidal mode instabilities will cause radial outflow of matter at both outer and inner radial edges, which may, in time, fill up the interior of the hollow mound. However, due to constraints of compute resources, we have not been able to evolve the system for long enough to detect significant mass loss in our current runs. In any case, the restrictive boundary conditions used in our simulations would be unable to provide an adequate description of mass outflow.

Discussion

In this paper we have performed 3D MHD simulations of perturbed accretion mounds which are initially in force equilibrium. We have confirmed the onset of pressure driven toroidal mode instabilities. [\citet=litwin01] had shown that [formula] non-axisymmetric modes will disrupt the equilibria for mounds beyond a threshold mass. Such ballooning type instabilities are multi-dimensional in nature and require a full 3D simulation for their investigation. Our simulations show that such instabilities result in the formation of multiple radially elongated streams distributed in the azimuthal direction. Part of the internal and gravitational potential energy is converted to magnetic energy and the strength is increased by the stretching of field lines due to internal motions. There is a substantial increase of the toroidal magnetic field component (from initial zero value). The instabilities grow more slowly in mounds of smaller size, and for mounds smaller than a threshold, instabilities were not excited within the run time of the simulations. This roughly corresponds to the threshold discussed by [\citet=litwin01] e.g. for a Zc = 45m mound, from our GS solutions we have β max = 293, which is close to the threshold β (~  260) predicted by [\citet=litwin01] for MHD instabilities (see discussion in MBM13).

A threshold mound mass was obtained by MB12 from static solutions, which was shown in MBM13 to correspond to the mass threshold beyond which gravity driven instabilities are triggered. From our current 3D MHD simulations we predict a lower mass threshold ([formula] for Bp  ~  1012G) above which pressure driven instabilities will start operating and matter will not be efficiently confined by the local field in the polar cap. Further addition of mass will result in the formation of radial density streams nestled in magnetic valleys and matter will flow out of the polar cap to spread over the surface of the neutron star. Our current simulations, limited by computational resources, could not follow the evolution of the mound beyond a few Alfvén times. However, we can expect that with continued accretion, there will be a dynamic equilibrium between inflow from the top and outflow from the sides. Such an outflow, aided by MHD instabilities, may prevent the secular process of field burial often invoked to explain the low magnetic fields of neutron stars in LMXBs and millisecond pulsars.

Semi-analytic work and MHD simulations by [\citet=melatos04] (hereafter PM04), [\citet=payne07] and [\citet=vigelius08] address the problem of field burial by accretion and come to the conclusion that mounds of size [formula] can cause the field to be buried. However our current work differs from the approach of PM04 in various aspects. We consider the confined matter to be a degenerate Fermi plasma whose pressure is several orders of magnitude larger than that of an isothermal gas considered in PM04. PM04 employ plasma loading on all field lines up to the equator whereas we confine the plasma strictly within a small polar cap. The excess mass loaded onto the field lines beyond the polar cap in PM04 provides additional lateral support which helps in the formation of large mounds and possible eventual burial of the local field.

In our current work, we have not addressed the burial problem directly, as we have limited ourselves to accretion mounds strictly confined within the polar cap with a fixed boundary far from the surface. Such a situation is more applicable to HMXB or young LMXB systems where higher field strengths and lower accretion rates result in mounds of smaller mass and size. If such a neutron star is to evolve into a low-field object by field burial, the process should commence at this early stage itself. However, our current work hints that pressure driven instabilities, which have so far been ignored, may play an important role in limiting the efficacy of the burial process.

Since our current PLUTO simulations are limited to a vertical extent less than the mound height, dynamic field distortions above the mound cannot be probed by them. However, from the static GS solutions in Fig. [\ref=45mGSextended] and Fig. [\ref=fieldcompare], it is clear that although the mound is only a few tens of metres high, the distortions in the field lines last for several hundred metres. This implies that distortions in the mound structure due to the MHD instabilities will also affect the field structure far away from the mound, leaving their imprint on the cyclotron lines (CRSF) from the accretion column.

Any distortion in the field lines will introduce broadening and complexity in the CRSF structure. To illustrate this we have evaluated the CRSF by taking the field distribution at the top of the PLUTO domain at the end of the simulation run (~  3.6tA) of a Zc = 50m mound using the method outlined in MB12. Fig. [\ref=pluto50mcrsf] shows the effect of broadening of the CRSF due to superposition of spectra from different parts of the mound. The extent of such broadening is expected to increase with accretion rate.

MHD instabilities may also produce observable timing signatures from accreting neutron stars. Although any radiation from the mound will be reprocessed in the overlying column, oscillations set up in the mound will be carried higher up in the column by the magnetic field, which will add to the noise observed in the power spectra from these systems. The rapid formation of the density streams within a few Alfvén times and subsequent oscillations in similar time scales will inject power in the fluctuation spectrum at frequencies corresponding to local instability growth rates. We have calculated the power spectral density from the Fourier transform of a simulated light curve from the surface of a hollow mound of Zc = 45m, by assuming the intensity of the local emission to depend on density as [formula] (see Fig. [\ref=holopds]). We integrate this over the top of the PLUTO domain to get the flux as a function of time, for a duration of [formula]s, corresponding to the longest run amongst the current set of simulations. The lightcurve clearly shows repetitive patterns which contribute to a broad feature of excess power around ~  800Hz in the power spectrum. Bumps at kilo Hertz frequencies corresponding to local Alfvén time scales are also seen. Thus MHD instabilities can result in oscillations in the emergent intensity which can show up as broad features in the power spectra of observed X-ray flux, and also contribute to high frequency noise.

Although power spectra of HMXB systems are mostly dominated by low frequency features arising in the accretion disc, some sources such as Cen X-3 [\citep=jernigan2000] show excess power in the high frequency regime which has been attributed to instabilities in the accretion column. Some sources show correlation between the photon index and the frequency of the main noise component which indicates that they may originate from the same physical region inside the accretion column [\citep=reig13]. For mounds of smaller mass, the growth rates being smaller, the characteristic frequencies at which the power would peak due to the MHD processes would also be lower. However, to explore the nature of the power spectra at lower frequencies, longer simulation runs need to be performed.
