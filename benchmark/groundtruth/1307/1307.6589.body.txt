A static universe is consistent with type Ia supernovae observations

Introduction

A major aim of this paper is to consider the hypothesis that current type Ia supernovae (for brevity SNe) observations analysed by [\cite=Betoule14] (hereafter B14) are consistent with a static universe. For cosmological results this paper should be read in conjunction with the results provided in [\citep=Crawford09b] (briefly described in Appendix [\ref=as1]).

Modern cosmology is dominated by the Big Bang theory, which attempts to bring together observational astronomy and particle physics. It has been observed that SNe produce consistent peak-luminosities which allows them to be considered as "standard candles" and used to measure the distance to their host galaxies. A fiducial constant is defined to be a property of type Ia supernovae that has no dependence on redshift and is, within statistical fluctuations, identical for each supernova.

The observed Hubble redshift, z, is defined as the ratio of the observed wavelength to the emitted wavelength minus one. In an expansion model the ratio of any observed time period to the emitted time period is identical to the ratio of the wavelengths, namely (1 + z). This is true for any time interval and is the time dilation. Therefore in an expansion model the stretch factor, defined as the width of the light curve divided by (1 + z), is considered to be an intrinsic property of SNe. On the other hand in a static universe the spectra are redshifted but there is no time dilation.

An observed characteristic of SNe is the strong positive correlation between the peak-luminosity and the width of the light curve so that on average an increase in the observed peak-luminosity is accompanied by an increase in the width of the light curve. This relation is referred to as the Phillips relation [\citep=Phillips93] and is used to provide a correction to the peak-magnitude that results in a better estimate for the fiducial constant than the peak-magnitude alone. A correlation between the colour-measure and the luminosity can be used to make a further improvement in the estimate of the fiducial constant.

The first strong evidence for time dilation in type Ia supernovae was provided by [\cite=Leibundgut96] with one supernova and [\cite=Goldhaber96] with seven SNe. This was quickly followed by multiple SNe results from [\cite=Goldhaber97] [\cite=Perlmutter99] [\cite=Goldhaber01]. These papers record developments in both SNe observations and analysis, the results of which are asserted to provide strong evidence for an expansion model chiefly because they show that the width of type Ia supernova light curves appears to increase with redshift in good agreement (but not completely accurately) with time dilation.

This paper nevertheless argues that more recent observations can be shown to be consistent with the hypothesis of a static cosmological model in which there is no time dilation and where redshifts are not due to expansion. It is shown that a property of the standard analysis means that regardless of whatever redshift dependence the observed light curve widths may have the calibrated widths will have only a very small redshift dependence.

It is shown that the apparent increase of widths of well observed SNe with redshift is partly due to selection effects and the assumption of an expansion model.

There are two further findings from SNe observations that appear to support the expansion model. First is the apparent dependence of photometric-redshift observations on redshift. These are observations that photometric properties of type Ia supernova spectra, as distinct from spectral wavelength measurements used to determine redshift, show a redshift dependence. Second the age of a spectrum is the number of days between the observation of the spectrum and the epoch of the peak-magnitude of the supernova. The ability to determine the age from subtle changes in the spectrum provides an independent method of estimating the light curve width of the supernova. However in a static model a measurement of redshift does not imply time dilation or alternatively a measurement of light curve width does not imply a measurement of redshift.

In a separate analysis of density of SNe observations it is shown that the static model can predict the density distribution of the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) SNe as a function of redshift without the need for evolution.

Section [\ref=s2] of this paper introduces the SNe data set provided by B14 which provides the redshift, the apparent peak-magnitude, the stretch factor (the light curve width divided by the time dilation), and the colour-measure for each type Ia supernova. These values have been obtained by a complex analysis based on an expansion model. A discussion of the Phillips relation follows, including definitions of notations to be used in this paper.

Section [\ref=s9] shows that the standard calibration method used by B14 has a property that regardless of the redshift dependency of the observed widths (or stretch factors) the calibrated supernova light widths will have little or no redshift dependence.

Section [\ref=s4] provides regressions as a function of redshift, z, for fiducial constants, stretch factors, absolute magnitudes and colour measures for an expansion model.

Section [\ref=s5] provides the major arguments for the hypothesis that the observations provided by B14 come from a static model and provides results in the form of graphs and tables.

Section [\ref=s5.1] explains why contrary to a static model extra wide SNe are apparently observed at large redshifts.

Section [\ref=s6] examines photometric and spectroscopic indicators of redshift. It is argued that both are consistent with a static universe.

Section [\ref=s7] shows that in a static model the observed rate of SNe is independent of redshift and depends only on volume surveyed and the area and duration of the survey. The predicted density of SNe as a function of redshift shows good agreement with the number distribution from the SNLS survey.

Section [\ref=s8] concludes with a brief discussion and summary of the important findings and summarizes the conclusions.

The distance modulus (equation [\ref=a6]) and the volume function (equation [\ref=a5]) for the static model are described in Appendix [\ref=as1]. The Big Bang distance-modulus used is for the modified Λ-CDM model (the required equations are provided in Appendix [\ref=as2]). For both cosmologies the reduced Hubble constant is h=0.7. In order to avoid ambiguity all measurements dependent on the expansion model are denoted by the suffix "B"(Big Bang), whereas all measurements dependent on the static model are denoted by the suffix "S".

The observations

The SNe data set

Recently B14 have provided an update of the [\cite=Conley11] analysis with better optical calibrations and more SNe. This JLA ("joint light-curve analysis") list sample has 720 SNe from the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS), nearby SNe (lowZ), the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) [\citep=Holtzman08] [\citep=Kessler09] and those revealed by the Hubble Sky Telescope (HST) [\citep=Riess07]. For each supernova, B14 provide the redshift, z, the apparent B band peak-magnitude, [formula], a light curve stretching parameter, X1, and the colour-measure, [formula], all with measurement uncertainty estimates. Since [\cite=Conley11] used a stretch factor that is more intuitive than X1 the stretch factors, [formula], were determine by the equation [\ref=d0] [\citep=Guy07]

[formula]

In order to simplify the analysis a colour-luminosity correction of [formula] (B14) is added to the apparent peak-magnitudes to get corrected peak-apparent magnitudes. Then to the first order these modified magnitudes are independent of the colour-measure.

The Phillips relation

The Phillips relation is central to the analysis presented in this paper. [\cite=Phillips93] found that the absolute peak-luminosities of SNe appear to be tightly correlated with the rate of decline of the B light curve. This correlation may be interpreted as being between magnitude and light curve width. The Phillips relation is intrinsic to the SNe and thus independent of any cosmological model. Rather than using peak-luminosity and width the more useful variables are peak-magnitude and width. In order to simplify later expressions in this paper the width and stretch factors are measured in magnitude units. Define a new variable, W, such that W = 2.5 log (w) where the width, w, is relative to a standard light curve. Thus the reference value of W is zero. Similarly define the stretch factor measured in magnitudes as S = 2.5 log (s)  ≈  1.086(s - 1) and define a new redshift variable Z = 2.5 log (1 + z)  ≈  1.086z which is the redshift measured in magnitudes. Thus the relationship w = (1 + z)s becomes W = S + Z. One advantage of using W is that although W can be unbounded, w is always greater than zero.

The Phillips relation between the apparent peak-magnitude, m, and W is defined by the equation m  =  m0  -  αW, where m0 is the expected apparent peak-magnitude and where α is the slope and by convention is positive. This equation corresponds to a luminosity equation: luminosity [formula].

In the current notation the use of the Phillips relation at a particular redshift requires that, within statistical fluctuations, m + αW is constant. Hence since M = m - μ, where μ is the distance modulus, then for all redshifts M + αW is constant. Early observations showed that all SNe have about the same magnitude. Then if the cosmology is correct the fiducial constant E defined by

[formula]

is a better fiducial constant than M and can be used for cosmological investigations.

B14 provide a value for α that allowing for equation [\ref=d0] (and the 1.086 factor) is [formula]. [\cite=Conley11] suggest α = 1.37 whereas [\cite=Sullivan11] have values near 1.39. Since the main aim of this paper is to compare cosmological models the important aspect is to compare SNe characteristics between low and high redshifts. Thus the best estimate of α is obtained by minimizing the χ2 if the fit of equation [\ref=e0] to a constant for nearby SNe. Furthermore any distinction between widths and stretch factors is removed by subtracting a linear fit relative to redshift from the absolute peak-magnitudes and the widths before the minimization process. The minimization with respect to [formula] using the 118 "lowZ" SNe produces the value [formula] which agrees with the B14 value. Thus α = 1.36 is used throughout this paper.

The calibration method

This paper argues that a property of the B14 calibration method for the widths of type Ia supernova is that any redshift dependence in the observed widths (or stretch factors) is automatically removed from the calibrated output. As indicated in Figure 1 of [\cite=Goobar11] intrinsic SNe light curves can have a wide variation as a function of wavelength. The B14 calibration method [\citep=Guy07] uses a light curve template to eliminate the effects of these intrinsic variations from the observed supernova light curves. For example the calibrated light curve width is the observed light curve width divided by a reference width which is the average, weighted by filter gain factors, of the template width over the observed rest-frame wavelengths. If wobserved(λ0) is the observed width for a supernova at an observed wavelength λ0 and wtemplate(λ) is the template width for the rest-frame wavelength λ then the calibrated width for the supernova is [formula] where λ0 = (1 + z)λ and the over-line denotes an average that includes filter gain factors. The calculation of the reference width mathematically mimics the operation of the telescope observing an ideal supernova. The assumption is that the rest-frame template light curves are the same for all SNe.

The virtue of this method is that if there are enough SNe the template light curves can be determined from the observed light curves. This can be done because the expected values for the calibrated widths should be a constant for all SNe. The estimation is done using an iterative procedure that minimizes the sum of the squares of the difference between calibrated widths (stretch factors) and a constant.

But if the rest-frame wavelength cover for individual SNe does not cover the full wavelength range this calibration method cannot distinguish between intrinsic wavelength variations in the width and any width dependence on redshift in the observed widths. Suppose there is redshift dependence that is common to all the SNe then the rest-frame light curve template will include this redshift variation as if it is part of the intrinsic wavelength variation in the light curves. Consequently the calibrated light curves for individual supernovae will not include this redshift dependence. A computer simulation of this calibration process confirmed this conclusion.

Since they assume that the expansion model is correct B14 divide the epoch differences for each SNe by (1 + z) to remove the time dilation which changes the widths to stretch factors. Since any correction like this is made prior to the main calibration the correction is identical in effect to an intrinsic redshift dependence. If they omitted this correction the output stretch factors for each SNe would (to the first order) agree with those from the original analysis. However if the universe is static the time dilation corrections are introducing an erroneous correction which is removed during analysis to produce calibrated widths that agree with the stretch factors. The basic conclusion is that this method of analysis will always produce calibrated widths (stretch factors) that do not show any redshift dependence. Note that the analysis procedure was designed to suit the situation where there was no intrinsic redshift dependence in the observed stretch factors.

Because the full light curve calibration is much more complex and involves more parameters there is a possibility of interactions between a redshift dependence in the widths and other parameters that could produce second order effects that would show up as a small redshift dependence in the calibrated widths (stretch factors). Clearly it would only occur if there was an original redshift dependence in the observed widths (stretch factors).

Irrespective of cosmology the effect of this calibration method is, to the first order, to produce calibrated widths that do not have any systematic redshifts (either intrinsic or applied) but that are correct;y calibrated relative to the intrinsic wavelength dependent widths. Thus the phase factor for these calibrated widths is simply the epoch difference without the (1 + z) divisor. Thus for the B14 data and calibration method the difference between the expansion model and the static model is in the interpretation of the calibrated parameters. The expansion model has apparent peak-magnitude and stretch factors and the static model has apparent peak-magnitude and widths.

Expansion model

Although the literature on the analysis of SNe in an expansion model is comprehensive and extensive [\citep=Goobar11], the following reanalysis provides a brief summary of results for later comparison with those from a static model. There are two reasons for this reanalysis, first to put them in the same form as the later results and second to provide results using [formula] (the stretch factor measured in magnitudes). Since W = S + Z any intrinsic variation in [formula] has the same variation in [formula]. The estimate of the fiducial constant [formula] is the absolute magnitude corrected for the Phillips relation and for any type Ia supernova with apparent magnitude, [formula], it is

[formula]

where [formula] is the absolute magnitude for an expansion cosmology and [formula] (equation [\ref=b2]) is the distance modulus. It is [formula] that is an estimate of the fiducial constant deemed to be constant for all SNe. Since at any redshift the expected value of the stretch factor, S, is zero then the expected value of [formula] is M0.

Table [\ref=t1] shows results for important regressions as a function of redshift (z) for both cosmological models which were obtained using the B14 results. In all rows the regressions were for the complete 740 SNe and the residuals (in magnitudes) are the residuals after the linear fit. The regression allowed for uncertainties in both variables and the uncertainties in the offset and slope were multiplied by the square root of the ratio of the χ2 / (N - 2) where N is the number of paired values. That is the original uncertainties were used only to produce weight factors and the final uncertainties reflect internal consistency.

Row 1 shows the regression for the stretch factor, [formula]. Row 2 shows the regression for the stretch factor, [formula]. Row 3 shows the regression for the width, [formula]. Row 4 shows the regression for the colour-measure, [formula]. Row 5 shows the regression for the magnitude, [formula]. Row 6 shows the regression for the fiducial constant, [formula].

Row 6 shows that [formula], with its insignificant slope and small variance, is a good fiducial constant. Furthermore the colour-measure (row 4) has a significant redshift dependence.

Both [formula] and [formula] have small but significant redshift dependencies. Since the stretch factor of SNe is intrinsic it should not have any dependence on redshift. This dependency is the major factor that has led to the idea of an acceleration of the universe and the concept of dark energy. However the property of the calibration method (section [\ref=s9]) means that this significant redshift dependence is probably an artifact and the results do not show strong support for the expansion model. At best they show consistency with the expansion model.

Some results, obtained later (section [\ref=s5]), from the static cosmological model are also shown in Table [\ref=t1], in which row 7 shows the regression for the static model width, WS, row 8 shows the regression for the absolute magnitude, [formula], and row 9 shows the regression for the fiducial constant, [formula].

Static model

A fundamental requirement of a static model is that there is no time dilation and thus the Hubble redshift is due to some mechanism (see Appendix [\ref=as1]) other than universal expansion.

The Phillips relation for a static model and for any type Ia supernova is

[formula]

where [formula] is the observed absolute peak-magnitude, [formula] is the apparent peak-magnitude, and the static cosmology distance modulus is [formula] (equation [\ref=a6]). For a static model and for all redshifts the expected value of [formula] is zero and the expected value for [formula] and [formula] is M0.

Consider the expected peak-magnitude and widths for SNe at a fixed redshift. Then because the Phillips relation is an intrinsic property of SNe the expected values must satisfy

[formula]

We can choose any value for [formula] and [formula] provided that equation [\ref=e4] is satisfied. The obvious choice that satisfies the requirement that in the static model the widths must be constant and agrees with section [\ref=s9] is to put [formula] equal to the stretch factor which produces

[formula]

These equations show that the expected value for the peak-magnitude for the static model, [formula], is significantly brighter than that for the expansion model. Note that [formula] and [formula] are both apparent magnitudes in the sense that no distance modulus is involved but not in the sense that they apply to a single observation.

Figure [\ref=f1] shows a scatter plot of the static model widths, [formula], as a function of redshift. The regression equation for this width is shown in row 7 of Table [\ref=t1] and it shows that they have a small but significant redshift dependence. As previously argued (section [\ref=s9]) the erroneous application of the time dilation correction will to the first order be removed by the B14 analysis. The small redshift dependence may be due to second order effects. Without a complete re-analysis without this erroneous time dilation correction we can conclude only that the light curve widths are consistent with the static model. The prediction is that if the universe is static a re-analysis will not show any significant redshift dependence in the calibrated widths.

Figure [\ref=f2] shows a plot of the static model absolute magnitude, [formula], as a function of redshift. The regression results are shown in row 8 of Table [\ref=t1] and show that [formula] has a small but just significant (5.2σ) redshift dependence. Note that whereas the expansion model distance modulus has, over the years, been fine-tuned to produce a good fiducial constant the static model distance modulus was derived completely independently of supernova observations and has no free parameters.

Figure [\ref=f3] shows a plot of the static model fiducial constant, [formula], as a function of redshift. The regression results are shown in row 9 of Table [\ref=t1] and show that [formula] has a negligible redshift dependence.

It is of interest to see why both the expansion model and the static model can be compatible with the data. Consider the relationship between the two absolute magnitudes, namely

[formula]

where f(z) is defined by

[formula]

What is remarkable is that f(z) is close to zero over the redshift range of the B14 SNe. The function f(z) starts at zero and has a maximum of ≈  0.1 mag at z = 0.8 and falling to 0.07 mag at z = 1.3.

These figures and regressions show that for B14 data the widths, absolute peak-magnitudes and fiducial constants of SNe are consistent with a static universe.

The apparent large widths at large redshifts

There is a problem that the widths of light curves of type Ia supernovae appear to show a systematic increase with redshift that appears to be contrary to a static universe. The major reason for this notion is that it is because these widths are computed with the expansion model that includes the time dilation effect.

An example is the 14 light curves shown by [\cite=Suzuki12]. For these supernovae the redshifts vary from 0.623 to 1.415 and the light curve (expansion model) widths vary from 1.48 to 2.43. However these SNe were analysed using the SALT2 calibration method (section [\ref=s9]) that means that the static model widths are equal to the stretch factors and these are not anomalous.

However there is a selection effect on the width that can be important. B14 require that - 3 < X1 < 3 and [\cite=Conley11] require that the stretch factor is in the equivalent range (0.7 < s < 1.3). Since resources are limited the search for high redshift SNe requires that the selection criteria are applied early in the search procedure. Typically this done by applying limits on the rest-frame rise and fall times. If this selection is done independently of the calibration method then it will tend to select SNe that have a static model width near (1+z).

Another important effect is selection of magnitude. That is the apparent magnitude [formula] must be close to the expected magnitude for that redshift. But as shown by equation [\ref=e5] the expected magnitude in the static model has a magnitude that is αZ fainter where the SNe have an expected width of (1 + z). For example at a redshift of one αZ  =  1.04 mag and at z = 1.5 it is 1.37 mag. Furthermore any bias in favour of brighter supernovae will, because of the Phillips relationship, produce a bias towards wider supernovae. Consequently a bias towards wider light curves at large redshifts is expected.

Although SNe with genuinely extra wide light curves are very rare this rarity is compensated by the very large search volumes at larger redshifts. This rarity also explains why SNe with very wide light curves are not seen in the local universe.

Other redshift evidence

Clearly the redshift of a SNe could be estimated by comparing its wavelength spectrum to the average rest-frame wavelength dependence. For example ever since [\cite=Tripp98] showed that there was a correlation between redshifts of SNe and their colour index B-V there has been a considerable effort [\citep=Howell07] [\citep=Bazin11] [\citep=Guy07] [\citep=Mohlabeng13] [\citep=Wang13] to use this correlation in order to develop a predictor of the redshift from photometric measurements. However in a static universe although this is a valid estimate of the redshift it is not evidence for time dilation. It is only in the expansion model that the redshift is related to time dilation and therefore with light curve width.

Another example is spectroscopic ages. SNe show a consistent variation in characteristics of their spectra with the number of days before and after the maximum. This variation is due to changes in composition, changes in the velocity of the ejecta and the depth of penetration of the ejecta. [\cite=Blondin08] have made a comprehensive analysis of these spectra for both local SNe and 13 high redshift SNe that shows that the age (the position in the light curve from the position of the peak-luminosity) of a spectrum can be estimated to within 1-3 days. If there are two or more spectra the aging rate and therefore the width can be estimated. In their analysis they explicitly assumed that this width dependence was a measure of redshift which is only true for the expansion model.

Density of SNLS SNe

The SNLS and the SDSS surveys both use the technique of wide-field rolling survey in which the same section of the sky is repeatedly observed in a regular manner. Whenever there is sudden brightening a possible supernova is flagged. The magnitude at this position is repeatedly measured and, if it passes selection criteria, a spectrum is taken and the redshift is measured. The important aspect of this technique is that to the first order and within the selected magnitude range there is no selection on redshift. Thus in a static model the relative number of SNe that are observed as a function of redshift depends only on the differential volume at that redshift. Different surveys have different time coverage and cover quite different areas. Therefore this analysis must be applied separately to each survey. Here the analysis is limited to the SNLS survey since it covered the largest redshift range.

Assuming that the density of supernova type Ia progenitors and their production rate for a particular survey is independent of redshift, the number expected in a survey is proportional to the density times the observed volume (equation [\ref=a5], below). We assume that the only selection criterion is that the observed SNe have an apparent magnitude greater than [formula] mag (equation [\ref=e3]) and that the magnitude distribution is Gaussian with a standard deviation of 0.2 mag.

The number of observed SNe in the SNLS survey are plotted as a function of redshift in Figure [\ref=f4]. The solid (red) line shows the expected distribution for a static model with SNe selected by apparent expansion model magnitude. For comparison the results for the expansion model assuming that the magnitudes have the same Gaussian distribution and magnitude cut off of 26 mag is shown as the dashed (blue) line.

In both models the density was chosen to match the observed counts by using a χ2 fit for the first six points (with count ≥  5 and with z  <  0.75) where the selection process has negligible effect. The multiplier for equation ([\ref=a5]) with a range of ±  0.05 about each z value was 3.04  kpc  - 3. The important point is that the position of the turn over near z = 0.7 for the static model is in reasonable agreement with the observations. Whereas the turn over for the expansion model is at larger redshifts. In the expansion model this discrepancy is explained by evolution.

Discussion

From the analysis of the B14 SNe data the main difference between the two cosmologies is in the composition of the fiducial constants. The expansion model decomposes the fiducial constant into a magnitude and stretch factor whereas the static model decomposes it into a magnitude and width.

To summarize the absolute peak-magnitudes, the widths, and the fiducial constants are consistent with a static universe.

Although photometric-redshift results can predict redshifts, in a static model this is not evidence for time dilation. The use of spectroscopic aging can predict light curve widths. But in a static model this is not a prediction of redshift. Consequently both results are consistent with the static model.

In an unrelated analysis it has been shown the number distribution of the (SNLS) SNe with redshift agrees with the static model without needing evolution or other ad hoc inclusions.

Finally note that if the SNe observations are fully explained by a static model the concept of dark energy or any other hypothesis invoked to explain the "expansion" of the universe is unnecessary.

Conclusions

For cosmological results this paper should be read in conjunction with the results described in [\citep=Crawford09b]. The most important conclusions for this paper are:

The supernovae Ia observations are consistent with a static universe.

There is no dark energy in a static universe.

The density of type Ia supernovae is independent of redshift.

An important conclusion from [\citep=Crawford09b] that is relevant here is

Dark matter is not required in a static universe.

Static Cosmology

The static cosmology used here is Curvature Cosmology [\citep=Crawford87a] [\citep=Crawford87b] [\citep=Crawford91] [\citep=Crawford93] [\citep=Crawford95a] [\citep=Crawford95b] [\citep=Crawford99] [\citep=Crawford06] [\citep=Crawford09a] [\citep=Crawford09b] that is a complete cosmology that shows excellent agreement with all major cosmological observations without needing dark matter or dark energy. (Note that [\citep=Crawford09b] is an update with corrections of the previous work.) It is compatible with both (slightly modified) general relativity and quantum mechanics and obeys the perfect cosmological principle that the universe is statistically the same at all places and times. It was shown in those papers that all the major observations (except supernovae) which have been used as evidence of expansion are in fact consistent with a static model.

Curvature Cosmology is based on two major hypotheses. The first hypothesis is that the Hubble redshift is due to curvature redshift, which is due to an interaction of photons with curved spacetime where they lose energy to other very low energy photons. Thus it is a tired-light model. The basic premise is that the local quantum field describing a photon is propagated along geodesics and is therefore subject to the focussing theorem. The angular momentum is determined by a volume integral over the quantum field and if its transverse size is changed there is a change in angular momentum which is contrary to its fixed angular momentum. The resolution of this contradiction is that the photon decays into one photon with nearly all the energy and two very low energy photons. Because of symmetry the large energy photon maintains the same trajectory as the original photon. Thus there is no angular deviation that would produce fuzzy images of distant objects. The second hypothesis is that there is a reaction pressure (curvature pressure) acting on the material causing spacetime curvature from the acceleration of high velocity particles in curved spacetime. Since the acceleration of the particles is normal to their velocity there is no change in their energy. The major effect of curvature pressure is to provide stability in the cosmological model. The basic cosmology is for a simple universal model of a uniform high temperature plasma (cosmic gas) at a constant density.

The theory has a good fit to the background X-ray radiation between the energies of 10-300 keV. The fitted temperature was [formula]K and the fitted density was equivalent to [formula] hydrogen atoms per cubic meter (2.57[formula]kg m- 3). For the simple homogeneous model this density is the only free parameter in the theory of curvature cosmology. The observations recorded in [\citep=Crawford09b] show that curvature cosmology is consistent with the observations of: Tolman surface brightness, angular size, SNe (superseded by this paper), gamma ray bursts, galaxy luminosity distributions, quasar luminosity distributions, X-ray background radiation, cosmic microwave background radiation, quasar variability, radio source counts, and the Butcher-Oemler effect. In curvature cosmology the cosmic background radiation (CMBR) is produced by the interaction of high energy electrons in the cosmic plasma with curved spacetime. The predicted temperature of the CMBR is 3.18 K to be compared with an observed value of 2.725 K. The prediction does depend on the nuclei mix in the cosmic gas and could vary from this value by several tenths of a degree. It is argued that its black body spectrum arises from the large number of curvature redshift interactions undergone by the CMBR photons.

As discussed in [\citep=Crawford09a] the quasar luminosity function is close to a power law in luminosity which is equivalent to an exponential distribution in magnitude. Consequently it is possible to estimate the two constants of the luminosity function for a group of quasars that have almost the same redshift. An estimate of the average apparent peak-magnitude can be derived from these constants and it can be used as a "standard candle". Assuming that luminosity function is the same at all redshifts these results can be used to estimate the distance modulus. The result is shown in Figure [\ref=f5]. Clearly Curvature Cosmology provides a good fit to the observations whereas the concordance results require inclusion of an evolutionary function.

Curvature redshift can explain the velocity dispersion of galaxies in the Coma cluster without requiring dark energy. Finally the anomalous acceleration of Pioneer 10 is explained by the effects of curvature redshift due to inter-planetary dust producing a very small decrease in the radio frequencies sent to and from the spacecraft.

An important result of curvature redshift is that the rate of energy loss by a photon (to extremely low energy secondary photons) as a function of distance, ds, is given by

[formula]

where MH is the mass of a hydrogen atom and the density in hydrogen atoms per cubic metrae is N = ρ / MH. Equation ([\ref=a1]) shows that the energy loss is proportional to the integral of the square root of the density along the photon's path. The Hubble constant is predicted to be

[formula]

The geometry is that of a three dimensional surface of a four dimensional hyper sphere. For this geometry the area of a three dimensional sphere with radius, r = Rχ where [formula] (work prior to 2009 has [formula]), is given by

[formula]

The surface is finite and χ can vary from 0 to π. The total volume v, is given by

[formula]

The only other result required here is the equation for the distance-modulus, (μC = m - M), which is

[formula]

where h = H / 100  km  s- 1  Mpc- 1.

Expansion model functions

The equations needed for the modified Λ-CDM model [\citep=Hogg99] [\citep=Goliath01] [\citep=Barboza08], with ΩM = 0.27, ΩK = 0 and where h is the reduced Hubble constant, are listed below. The symbol w* is used for the acceleration parameter in order to avoid confusion with the width, w. These equations depend on the function E(z) defined here by

[formula]

The distance modulus is

[formula]

The co-moving volume is

[formula]

The equation of state parameter w* in the expansion model distance modulus is included to investigate the effects of including the cosmological constant. [\cite=Conley11] found that the parameter, w*, has a value w* =  - 0.91, whereas [\cite=Sullivan11] found that w* =  - 1.069. Although its actual value is not critical for this paper the value of w* is chosen to be w* =  - 1.11, so that [formula] would be the best fiducial constant with the values for the peak-magnitudes and stretch factors provided by B14.
