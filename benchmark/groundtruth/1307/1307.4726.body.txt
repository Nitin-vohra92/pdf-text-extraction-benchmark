Stein fillings of contact 3-manifolds obtained as Legendrian surgeries

Introduction

A Stein manifold is a complex manifold that admits a proper holomorphic embedding into [formula] for some large integer N. According to [\cite=Grauert_Levi's_problem_and_imbedding_real_analytic_manifolds_1958], a Stein manifold W admits an exhausting plurisubharmonic function [formula]. For any regular value c of ρ, the complex tangencies define a contact structure on the level set Mc: = {x∈W|ρ(x) = c}. We call the manifold Wc: = {x∈W|ρ(x)  ≤  c} a Stein filling of the contact manifold Mc.

Given a contact 3-manifold (M,ξ), there are two natural questions one can ask: Is (M,ξ) Stein fillable? and if yes, then is it possible to classify all the Stein fillings of (M,ξ)?

The first question has been addressed in terms of open book decompositions. For example, in [\cite=Giroux_Correspondence], Giroux gave a complete characterization of Stein fillability in terms of open book decomposition, see also [\cite=Akbulut_Ozbagci_Stein_Surface_Lefschetz_fibrations] [\cite=Loi_Piergallini_Lefschetz_fibrations].

The second question has been answered for some specific contact 3-manifolds. Here we recall a few results in this direction. In [\cite=Eliashberg_Filling_by_holomorphic_disks_and_applications], Eliashberg showed that there is a unique Stein filling, up to symplectic deformation, of S3 with the standard tight contact structure. In [\cite=Stipsicz_gauge_theory_and_stein_fillings_of_certain_3_manifolds], Stipsicz showed that there is a unique Stein filling, up to homeomorphism, of the Poincaré homology sphere Σ(2,3,5) and the 3-torus T3. In [\cite=Wendl_Planar_open_books], Wendl showed that there is a unique Stein filling, up to symplectomorphism, of the 3-torus T3. In [\cite=McDuff_Rational_ruled_surfaces], McDuff showed that, for a universally tight contact structure, there is a unique Stein filling of a lens space L(p,1) ([formula]), and there are two Stein fillings of the lens space L(4,1), up to diffeomorphism. In [\cite=Lisca_Classification_of_Stein_fillings_on_lens_spaces], Lisca classified the Stein fillings of universally tight lens spaces up to diffeomorphism. In [\cite=Plamenevskaya_VHMorris_Planar_open_books], Plamenevskaya and Van Horn-Morris showed that there is a unique Stein filling, up to symplectic deformation, of L(p,1) with a virtually overtwisted tight contact structure. In [\cite=Kaloti_Stein_fillings_of_planar_open_books], among other classes of manifolds, the first author classified Stein fillings of virtually overtwisted tight contact structures on the lens space L(pm + 1,m) for [formula], up to symplectic deformation. In [\cite=Ohta_Ono_Classifications_of_Stein_fillings_1] [\cite=Ohta_Ono_Classifications_of_Stein_fillings_2], Ohta and Ono classified the Stein fillings of some links of simple singularities. In [\cite=Schoenenberger_thesis_upenn], Schönenberger showed that the Stein fillings of some contact Seifert fibered spaces are unique up to diffeomorphism. In [\cite=Starkston_Symplectic_fillings_of_Seifert_fibered_spaces], Starkston gave finiteness results and some classifications, up to diffeomorphism, of minimal strong symplectic fillings of certain contact Seifert fibered spaces over S2.

In this paper, we classify the Stein fillings, up to diffeomorphism, or up to symplectic deformation, for an infinite family of contact 3-manifolds including an infinite number of contact hyperbolic 3-manifolds. This is the first known classification result for any contact hyperbolic 3-manifolds.

These contact manifolds are supported by particular open books, which we describe now. Let Σ be a compact planar surface with n + p + q + 1 boundary components [formula] as shown in Figure [\ref=fig:p14], where [formula] and n  ≥  k. Let Φ be a diffeomorphism which is the composition of right handed Dehn twists written as

[formula]

where τi is the positive Dehn twist about a simple closed curve parallel to the boundary component ci, mi  ≥  0, and τB1, τB2 are positive Dehn twists along the simple closed curves B1 and B2 shown in Figure [\ref=fig:p14].

Let (M,ξ) be the contact 3-manifold supported by the open book (Σ,Φ). Then the contact 3-manifold (M,ξ) admits a unique Stein filling up to diffeomorphism.

The open book shown in Figure [\ref=fig:p14] covers a lot of interesting special cases. We describe a few of them below. In (S3,ξstd), let L be a Legendrian twist knot, K- 2p, with Thurston-Bennequin invariant - 1 and rotation number 0, where 2p denotes the number of left-handed half twists. If p = 1, then it is a right handed trefoil. Note that the maximal Thurston-Bennequin invariant is 1 for the Legendrian twist knot K- 2p at hand [\cite=Etnyre_Ng_Vertesi_Twist_knots_classification], and one stabilizes it twice to obtain the Legendrian knot L and stabilize it further as in Figure [\ref=fig:Legendrian_surgery_diagram_for_infinite_family1]. Let n,k  ≥  1 be two integers such that n  ≥  k. Let Sn - k+Sk - 1-(L) be the result of n - k positive stabilizations and k - 1 negative stabilizations of L. Figure [\ref=fig:Legendrian_surgery_diagram_for_infinite_family1] depicts a Legendrian link in (S3,ξstd) one of whose components is Sn - k+Sk - 1-(L). The other components are all Legendrian unknots with Thurston-Bennequin invariant - 1, pushed off mi times, where mi is a non-negative integer for [formula] if k > 1 or n > k. Let (M',ξ') denote the contact structure obtained by performing Legendrian surgery along the link given in Figure [\ref=fig:Legendrian_surgery_diagram_for_infinite_family1].

The contact 3-manifold (M',ξ') has a unique Stein filling up to diffeomorphism.

Another application of the above observation is classifying Stein fillings of manifolds obtained by Legendrian surgeries along some Legendrian 2-bridge knots. Figure [\ref=fig:2-bridge_knots] depicts a 2-bridge knot B(p,q), where p,q are positive integers. If q = 1, then it is the twist knot K- 2p.

There is a Legendrian 2-bridge knot B(p,q) with Thurston-Bennequin invariant - 1 and rotation number 0, such that the Legendrian surgery on (S3,ξstd) along any of its stabilizations yields a contact 3-manifold with unique Stein filling up to diffeomorphism.

In addition to classifying Stein fillings up to diffeomorphism, we can classify Stein fillings of Legendrian surgeries along some Legendrian twist knots up to symplectic deformation. Even though these manifolds admit open books considered in Theorem [\ref=theorem_factorization_of_mapping_class], we include a separate proof here because the notion of symplectic deformation is stronger than that of diffeomorphism.

If L is a Legendrian twist knot K- 2p with Thurston-Bennequin invariant - 1 and rotation number 0, then the Legendrian surgery on (S3,ξstd) along any stabilization of L yields a contact 3-manifold with unique Stein filling up to symplectic deformation equivalence.

If p > 1, then the twist knot K- 2p is hyperbolic. By the hyperbolic Dehn surgery theorem in [\cite=Thurston_3_Manifolds_Kleinian_groups_and_hyperbolic_geometry], Legendrian surgery on (S3,ξstd) along a Legendrian hyperbolic twist knot with sufficiently many stabilizations yields a contact hyperbolic 3-manifold. So, immediately, we have

There are infinitely many contact hyperbolic 3-manifolds each of which admits a unique Stein filling up to symplectic deformation equivalence.

Rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section [\ref=background] we recall some basic notions from mapping class groups and contact geometry. In Section [\ref=proofs_of_main_results] we give proofs of all our results.

Background

In this section, we recall some basic notions from mapping class groups and give an explicit presentation of the planar mapping class groups to be used throughout. We also describe a technique used to understand surgeries along Legendrian knots through open books.

Planar mapping class group

Let [formula] denote a sphere with n + 1 open disks removed. We label the boundary components of [formula] as [formula]. By fixing an outer boundary component, denoted by c0, we can embed [formula] in [formula]. The mapping class group of [formula] is a group of self diffeomorphisms of [formula] up to isotopy such that each diffeomorphism fixes the boundary pointwise. We will denote the mapping class group by [formula] and will call it planar mapping class group. It is a well known fact that the mapping class group of any surface is finitely presented, see [\cite=Farb_Margalit_Primer]. We use a particular presentation of the mapping class group of a planar surface due to Margalit and McCommand, [\cite=McCommand_Margalit_Braid_Group]. We briefly describe their presentation.

For this presentation, we assume that the boundary components are arranged at vertices of a regular n-gon. We call a curve convex, if it is isotopic to the boundary of a convex hull of a collection of boundary components. A Dehn twist about a convex curve is called convex Dehn twist. According to [\cite=McCommand_Margalit_Braid_Group], mapping class group of [formula] is generated by convex twists. The relations are given by

τAτB  =  τBτA if and only if A is disjoint from B. Here A and B are simple closed curves.

[formula], where A,B,C are disjoint collections of boundary components and Dehn twists are convex Dehn twist about them. In addition, we require that the boundary components are ordered such that the cyclic clockwise ordering of boundary components in A followed by those in B followed by those in C induces the cyclic clockwise ordering of boundary components in [formula].

Now we define homomorphisms from [formula] to [formula], which define multiplicities associated to Dehn twists. Similar homomorphisms were defined in [\cite=Plamenevskaya_VHMorris_Planar_open_books]. Recall that [formula] is isomorphic to [formula] which is generated by Dehn twists about each of the boundary components. Let [formula] be a word written as product of positive Dehn twists. Let ci and cj be any boundary components in [formula] other than c0.

Capping off all the boundary components of [formula] except ci,cj,c0 with disks, we obtain a map to [formula] which just counts the number of Dehn twists about the curve parallel to the outer boundary c0. We call this the joint multiplicity of boundary components i and j and denote it by Mi,j(Φ).

Cap off all the holes except the boundary components ci and c0. This induces a map from [formula] to [formula] and the map counts the Dehn twists about the boundary parallel curve. We call this the multiplicity of the boundary component ci. Denote it by Mi(Φ).

Open book decompositions, Lefschetz fibrations and Stein fillings

We recall briefly notion of open book decompositions. Given a closed oriented 3-manifold M, an embedded open book decomposition of M is a pair (B,π) where

B is an oriented link in M called the binding of the open book decomposition and,

[formula] is a fibration such that π- 1(θ) is the interior of a compact surface Sθ with ∂Sθ = B for all θ∈S1.

Given an embedded open book decomposition as above, since π is a locally trivial fibration over S1, it is completely specified by a diffeomorphism of the fiber surface S. To see this, think of S1 as the interval

[formula]

is contractible any fiber bundle over it is trivial. Hence, the original fibration [formula] can now be obtained by gluing the surfaces S  ×  {0} and S  ×  {2π}. Hence we get an alternate description of an open book decomposition for M called an abstract open book decomposition which is defined as follows.

S is an oriented compact surface with boundary called the page of the open book decomposition.

φ:S  →  S is a diffeomorphism of S such that φ|∂S is the identity. The diffeomorpshim φ is called the monodromy of the open book decomposition.

Given an abstract open book decomposition (S,φ), we get a 3-manifold Mφ as S  ×  [0,1]  /    ~  , where ~   is the equivalence relation (x,1)  ~  (φ(x),0) for x∈S, and (y,t)  ~  (y,t') for y∈∂S, t,t'∈[0,1].

Note that an abstract open book decomposition (S,φ) determines an oriented closed manifold Mφ and an embedded open book decomposition (Bφ,πφ) up to diffeomorphism.

For an embedded open book decomposition (B,π), a positive stabilization is an operation of plumbing a positive Hopf band to (B,π). For an abstract open book decomposition, a positive stabilization changes the page S by attaching a 1-handle to get a new surface S'. The monodromy of the open book decomposition changes from φ to φ  ·  τc, where c is curve which intersects the co-core of the attached 1-handle exactly once and φ is extended to the new surface by identity. For an abstract open book decomposition (S,φ), a conjugation is an operation to replace the monodromy φ by fφf- 1, where f is a self-diffeomorphism of S which is identity on the boundary.

A contact structure ξ on M is supported by an embedded open book decomposition (B,π) of M if ξ can be isotoped through contact structures so that there is a 1-form α for ξ such that:

α  >  0 on B.

dα is a positive area form on each page Sθ of the open book decomposition.

A contact 3-manifold is supported by an abstract open book decomposition (S,φ) of if ξ is supported by an embedded open book decomposition determined by (S,φ).

Given any abstract, or embedded open book decomposition (B,π) of M, according to a construction of Thurston and Winkelnkemper [\cite=Thurston_Wilkenkeper_Contact_structures_from_open_books], it supports a contact structure ξ. Giroux proved that given a contact structure ξ on M, one can find an embedded open book decomposition of M supporting ξ.

Let M be a closed oriented 3-manifold. Then there is a one to one correspondence between the oriented contact structures on M up to isotopy and the open book decompositions of M up to positive stabilization, and there is a one to one correspondence between the oriented contact structures on M up to isomorphism and the abstract open book decompositions of M up to positive stabilization and conjugation.

From now on, unless explicitly specified, an open book decomposition will mean the abstract one.

Following Theorem [\ref=Giroux_1-1], Giroux [\cite=Giroux_Correspondence], Loi-Piergallini [\cite=Loi_Piergallini_Lefschetz_fibrations], Akbulut-Ozbagci [\cite=Akbulut_Ozbagci_Stein_Surface_Lefschetz_fibrations] showed that a contact manifold (M,ξ) is Stein fillable if and only if there exists an open book decomposition (S,φ) supporting (M,ξ) such that the monodromy is written as a product of positive Dehn twists. The proof of this result tells us how to construct a Stein filling from (S,φ) and a given a positive factorization of φ. We briefly recall it here. To do so we first need to recall a few facts about Lefschetz fibrations. We refer the reader to [\cite=Gompf_Stipsicz] for more details.

Suppose X is an oriented 4-manifold, and D2 is an oriented 2-dimensional disk. The smooth map f:X  →  D2 is a Lefschetz fibration if df is onto with finitely many exceptional points in the interior of D2, the map f is locally trivial in the complement of these exceptional points, and around each of the exceptional points, f can be modelled in some choice of complex coordinates by f(z1,z2) = z21 + z22. If x∈D2 is a regular value, then f- 1(x) is a compact smooth surface S. This surface S is called the regular fiber. At each critical value p∈D2, f- 1(p) is a singular surface with exactly one positive transverse self-intersection point, we call it a singular fiber. One can assume that all the critical values, [formula] are isolated and monodromy of the fibration around each critical value pi, is specified by an element of Map(S,∂S). This element is given by a right handed Dehn twist about a non trivial curve αi  ⊂  S. The global monodromy of the fibration is given by the product of Dehn twists [formula].

For positive factorizations, a Hurwitz move is defined by

[formula]

for 1  ≤  i  <  n. Two positive factorizations are Hurwitz equivalent if one of them can be obtained from the other by finitely many Hurwitz moves.

In addition, to remove the dependence on choice of the reference fiber, the Dehn twists are thought of as elements of the mapping class of an abstract surface S. This requires the choice of an identification diffeomorphism and induces an equivalence relation on the set of mapping class group factorizations: global conjugation. It is defined as

[formula]

where f is a diffeomorphism of Σ which is an element of Map(S,∂S).

Given an abstract open book decomposition (S,φ) of the manifold (M,ξ) and a positive factorization of φ by [formula], where [formula] are nontrivial curves in S, one can construct a Lefschetz fibration X which has global monodromy [formula], and is diffeomorphic to [formula], where Hi is a 4-dimensional 2-handle attached along αi in a fiber of S  ×  ∂D2  →  ∂D2 with relative framing - 1. Note that the diffeomorphism type of X is unique up to Hurwitz equivalence and global conjugation of the positive factorization of φ. According to [\cite=Eliashberg_Stein_handle_attachment], X admits a Stein structure, and ∂X is diffeomorphic to M. Furthermore, the contact structure on M induced by this Stein filling agrees with the contact structure supported by the open book decomposition (S,φ) through the Giroux correspondence. Hence, X gives a Stein filling of (M,ξ).

Conversely, given a Stein filling, X, of (M,ξ), one can construct a Lefschetz fibration of X (see [\cite=Akbulut_Ozbagci_Stein_Surface_Lefschetz_fibrations] [\cite=Loi_Piergallini_Lefschetz_fibrations]) such that ∂X  =  M has a natural open book decomposition with monodromy written as a positive factorization and supports ξ. Hence to get an upper bound on the number of Stein fillings of (M,ξ), one will have to find all compatible open books and then find all possible ways of factorizing a given monodromy in terms of positive Dehn twists. But in the case of manifolds supported by planar open book decompositions this problem is approachable due to the following theorem of Wendl.

Suppose (M,ξ) is supported by a planar open book decomposition. Then every strong symplectic filling (X,ω) of (M,ξ) is symplectic deformation equivalent to a blow-up of an allowable Lefschetz fibration compatible with the given open book decomposition of (M,ξ).

So in case of contact manifolds supported by planar open book decompositions, this theorem tells us that we need to find all possible ways of factorizing the given monodromy in terms of positive Dehn twists, to get an upper bound on the number of Stein fillings. Then one can try to classify the Stein fillings by realizing this upper bound. This approach to classifying Stein fillings has proved to be successful in [\cite=Plamenevskaya_VHMorris_Planar_open_books] [\cite=Kaloti_Stein_fillings_of_planar_open_books].

Open book decompositions for manifolds obtained by surgery along knots.

It follows from Giroux correspondence that any Legendrian knot L in (M,ξ) can be embedded in a page of an open book supporting ξ as an essential simple closed curve, see [\cite=Etnyre_Lectures_on_open_book_decompositions]. One can prove that if L is a Legendrian knot on a page of open book (S,φ) supporting (M,ξ) and (M( - 1)(L),ξL) is the contact structure obtained from (M,ξ) by Legendrian surgery along L, then (M( - 1)(L),ξL) is supported by the open book decomposition (S,φ  ·  τL). Here L is thought of as a simple closed curve embedded in the surface S.

Given a Legendrian knot L, there is a natural operation called positive/negative stabilization of L that can be used to get another Legendrian knot in the same knot type. For a Legendrian knot in [formula] with its standard contact structure, positive (resp. negative) stabilization is achieved by adding a zigzag to the front projection of the Legendrian knot such that rotation number of the Legendrian knot increases (resp. decreases) by 1. Stabilization is a well-defined operation, that is, it does not depend on the point at which zigzags are added. See [\cite=Etnyre_Lectures_on_open_book_decompositions] for details and proof of the following lemma.

Let (S,φ) be an open book decomposition supporting the contact structure ξ on M. Suppose L is a Legendrian knot in M that lies in the page S. If we stabilize (S,φ) as shown in Figure [\ref=Knot_stabilization], then we may isotope the page of the open book so that positive (negative) stabilization of L appears on the page S as shown in Figure [\ref=Knot_stabilization].

Classification of Stein fillings

We begin by observing a purely combinatorial lemma. The purpose of this lemma is to get restrictions on the curves which can appear in any positive factorization of the given monodromy in terms of Dehn twists. Refer to Figure [\ref=fig:p14] for the notation used below.

Any positive factorization of Φ must be given by the product of Dehn twists τm11, τm22, [formula] τmn + q - 1n + q - 1, τmn + q + 1n + q + 1, [formula] τmn + p + qn + p + q, and the Dehn twists τB'1 and τB'2 where B'1 encloses the same holes as B1, and B'2 the same holes as B2.

Recall from Section [\ref=background] that, Mi,j denotes the joint multiplicity of the mapping class Φ about the ith and jth boundary components, and Mi denotes the multiplicity of the mapping class Φ about the ith boundary component.

Since Mn + q = 2 and Mi,n + q = 2 for [formula], there are exactly two monodromy curves, say B'1 and B'2, enclosing cn + q and ci for [formula]. Since Mn + q,j = 0 for [formula], Mr,n + q = 1 for [formula], and Ms,t = 0 for [formula] and [formula], the two monodromy curves B'1 and B'2 enclose [formula] and [formula] respectively.

For [formula], Mj = mj and Mi,j = 0 for any [formula] and i  ≠  j. So cj is enclosed solely by mj boundary parallel monodromy curves.

For [formula], there are no non-boundary-parallel monodromy curves, other than B'1 and B'2, enclosing ci. Suppose otherwise, then for some [formula], there is a monodromy curve, other than B'1 and B'2, enclosing cj and ch. If either j or h does not belong to [formula], then j and h cannot belong to [formula] and [formula], respectively. So Mj,h  ≥  2. However, from the original positive decomposition of Φ, we have Mj,h = 1. So we arrive at a contradiction. If both j and h belong to [formula], then Mj,h  ≥  3. However, also from the original positive decomposition of Φ, we have Mj,h = 2. So we arrive at a contradiction as well.

Hence for [formula], there are mi boundary parallel monodromy curves enclosing ci.

With the notation as in above lemma, any other factorization of Φ can be written as [formula] up to Hurwitz equivalence. To see this, recall that since boundary Dehn twists commute with every diffeomorphism we can move them all to the left in the factorization as written above. Now product of Dehn twists τB'1 and τB'2 is on the right side of this positive factorization. Hurwitz move on the product of Dehn twists can potentially change the homotopy class of both the curves B'1 and B'2, to say B''1 and B''2. But still B''i enclose the same set of holes as B'i for i = 1,2. With abuse of notation we still call these new set of curves as B'1 and B'2, as Lemma [\ref=lemma_combinatorial] only specifies the curves B'1 and B'2 up to the set of holes enclosed by each of these curves. So using commutativity of boundary parallel Dehn twists and Hurwitz moves one can arrange the factorization as above.

In our case, since we only have two non boundary parallel monodromy curves, a Hurwitz move is also a global conjugation.

Positive factorizations.

In this subsection, we prove that τB1τB2 has at most 2 different positive factorizations, up to a global conjugation, in Map(Σ,∂Σ) for some simple cases of the surface Σ. We will reduce the above factorization problem to these simple cases later.

In proving these results, first step will be to get restrictions on intersection number of curves B'1 and B'2. To make sense of intersection numbers of curves, we assume for the rest of the paper that any two curves are isotoped to intersect minimally.

Let Σ be the surface in Figure [\ref=fig:p14] with k = 1 and n = 1. Suppose p = q = 1. Then [formula] has at most two positive factorizations up to a global conjugation.

Since k = n = 1, there is no hole which is enclosed by B2 but not by B1, and there is no hole which is enclosed by B1 but not by B2.

By Lemma [\ref=lemma_combinatorial], any positive factorization of τB1τB2 is τB'1τB'2 up to a global conjugation, where B'1 and B'2 enclose the same set of holes as B1 and B2, respectively.

We would like to get more information about the curves B'1 and B'2. To do that, we use a theorem by Thurston [\cite=thurston_geometry_and_dynamics_of_diffeomorphism_of_surface]. This was suggested by Dan Margalit to us.

We assume that each of the boundary components is filled by a disk with one puncture. To avoid confusion, we will call this surface [formula] still. Note that the curves B1 and B2 fill the surface [formula]. As explained in [\cite=FLP_Thurston's_work_on_surfaces], one can construct a singular flat Euclidean structure and a representation of the subgroup of [formula] generated by τB1 and τB2. Precisely (see [\cite=thurston_geometry_and_dynamics_of_diffeomorphism_of_surface], and [\cite=Farb_Margalit_Primer]), suppose I(B1,B2) denote the geometric intersection number of B1 and B2, then there is a representation [formula] given by

[formula]

with the following properties:

An element g∈〈τB1,τB2〉 is periodic, reducible, or pseudo-Anosov according to whether ρ(g) is elliptic, parabolic, or hyperbolic.

When ρ(g) is hyperbolic the pseudo-Anosov mapping class g has stretch factor equal to the larger of the absolute values of the two eigenvalues of ρ(g).

The matrix ρ(g) is called an affine representative for g. So τB1 has affine representative given by [formula], and τB2 has an affine representative [formula]. Thus, we obtain an affine representative for τB1τB2. It is [formula]. This matrix has trace - 14, so τB1τB2 has a pseudo-Anosov representative with stretch factor the larger of the absolute values of the two eigenvalues, that is [formula]. Note that the stretch factor of a pseudo-Anosov representative of a pseudo-Anosov diffeomorphism is in fact an invariant of the pseudo-Anosov diffeomorphism. This is because two homotopic pseudo-Anosov representatives are conjugate by a diffeomorphism isotopic to the identity ([\cite=FLP_Thurston's_work_on_surfaces]), and any two conjugate pseudo-Anosov representatives have the same stretch factors ([\cite=Farb_Margalit_Primer]).

Since τB'1τB'2, as a conjugation of τB1τB2, is also pseudo-Anosov, B'1 and B'2 have to intersect and fill the surface [formula]. Otherwise there is a non-boundary-parallel simple closed curve which is invariant by τB'1τB'2. This is impossible for a pseudo-Anosov diffeomorphism.

Assume that I(B'1,B'2)  =  z, where z is a non-negative integer. As above we obtain the affine representative for τB'1τB'2. It is [formula]. Since τB'1τB'2 and τB1τB2 are conjugate, they have the same stretch factors ([\cite=Farb_Margalit_Primer]). So [formula], and z = 4.

Now we conjugate τB'1τB'2 by a diffeomorphism which takes B'1 to B1, and B'2 to a curve B''2. We know that B''2 and B1 intersect in exactly 4 points. Since B''2 and B2 represent the same homology classes in [formula], we know that the algebraic intersection number of B''2 and B2 with each nontrivial arc in the surface is the same. In particular, for the arc γ shown in the left of Figure [\ref=fig:open_book_and_arc_a_shown], the algebraic intersection number of B''2 and γ is 0, and the geometric intersection number of B''2 and γ is even.

If I(B''2,γ)  =  0, then it is easy to see that B''2 is isotopic to B1. This is impossible by the above argument.

Suppose I(B''2,γ)  ≥  2. We cut the surface [formula] open along the arc γ, and think of the resulted surface as a pair of pants with the outer boundary drawn as a rectangle. See the right of Figure [\ref=fig:open_book_and_arc_a_shown]. Under this operation, B''2 is cut into a collection of properly embedded arcs which are pairwise disjoint. Each of these arcs is one of the following three types.

Type I: Both end points of the arc are on the left edge of the rectangle.

Type II: Both end points of the arc are on the right edge of the rectangle.

Type III: The arcs have one end point on the left edge and the other on the right edge of the rectangle.

Since B1 is parallel to the outer boundary of the rectangle, each of Type I, II and III arcs intersects the curve B1 in 2 points or is disjoint with B1. It is easy to see that each of Type I, II, and III arcs intersects the curve B1 in exactly 2 points.

For B''2 to be a simple closed curve enclosing holes c1 and c2, there is at least one arc of Type I and at least one arc of Type II. Since I(B''2,B1)  =  4, B''2 is cut open into a Type I arc and a Type II arc.

If the Type I arc encloses the hole c1 with the left edge of the rectangle, and the Type II arc encloses the hole c2 with the right edge of the rectangle, then some power of τB1 will send B''2 to be the one which is formed by the two arcs shown in the right of Figure [\ref=fig:open_book_and_arc_a_shown]. Hence τB1τB''2 is conjugate to τB1τB2.

If the Type I arc encloses the hole c2 with the left edge of the rectangle, and the Type II arc encloses the hole c1 with the right edge of the rectangle, then some power of τB1 will send B''2 to be the one which is formed by the two arcs shown in the left of Figure [\ref=fig:open_book_and_arc_a_shown0]. So there are at most two choices for the curve B''2 up to conjugation. Hence, there are at most two different factorizations of τB1τB2 up to a global conjugation.

Let Σ be the surface in Figure [\ref=fig:p14] with k = 1 or 2, and n = 2. Suppose p = q = 1. Then [formula] has at most two positive factorizations up to a global conjugation.

If k = 1 and n = 2, then there is no hole which is enclosed by B2 but not by B1, and there is one hole which is enclosed by B1 but not by B2. If k = n = 2, then there is no hole which is enclosed by B1 but not by B2, and there is one hole which is enclosed by B2 but not by B1. By symmetry, we can only prove for the first case.

By Lemma [\ref=lemma_combinatorial], any positive factorization of τB1τB2 is τB'1τB'2 up to a global conjugation, where B'1 and B'2 enclose the same set of holes as B1 and B2, respectively.

The curves B1 and B2 fill the surface [formula]. Following exactly the same argument we get that B'1 and B'2 intersect in exactly 4 points. Now we conjugate τB'1τB'2 by a diffeomorphism which takes curve B'1 to B1. This will change τB'1τB'2 to τB1τB''2, where B''2 is a curve which encloses the same set of holes as B2.

Let γ be an arc connecting holes c4 and c0, see the left of Figure [\ref=fig:open_book_and_arc_a_shown1]. Then, by the proof of Lemma [\ref=lemma_uniqueness_of_positive_factorization], B''2 intersects γ in 2 points minimally. We cut the surface [formula] open along the arc γ, and think of the resulted surface with the outer boundary drawn as a rectangle. See the right of Figure [\ref=fig:open_book_and_arc_a_shown1]. So B''2 becomes two arcs one of which has two endpoints belong to the left edge and encloses one hole of c1 and c3, and the other of which has two endpoints belong to the right edge and encloses the other hole of c1 and c3.

Exactly as in the proof of Lemma [\ref=lemma_uniqueness_of_positive_factorization], we get that up to a diffeomorphism preserving orientation and commuting with τB1, there are at most two choices for the curve B''2. Hence, there are at most two different positive factorizations of τB1τB2 up to a global conjugation.

Let Σ be the surface in Figure [\ref=fig:p14] with k = 2 and n = 3. Suppose p = q = 1. Then [formula] has at most two positive factorizations up to a global conjugation.

Since k = 2 and n = 3, there is one hole which is enclosed by B2 but not by B1, and one hole which is enclosed by B1 but not by B2.

By Lemma [\ref=lemma_combinatorial], any positive factorization of τB1τB2 is τB'1τB'2 up to a global conjugation, where B'1 and B'2 enclose the same set of holes as B1 and B2, respectively.

The curves B1 and B2 fill the surface [formula]. Following exactly the same argument as in the proof of Lemma [\ref=lemma_uniqueness_of_positive_factorization], we get that B'1 and B'2 intersect in exactly 4 points. Now we conjugate τB'1τB'2 by a diffeomorphism which takes curve B'1 to B1. This will change τB'1τB'2 to τB1τB''2, where B''2 is a curve which encloses the same set of holes as B2.

If we fill each hole of [formula], including the outer boundary, by a disk with a marked point, then we get a 2-sphere with 6 marked points. The two curves B1 and B''2 give a cell decomposition of the 2-sphere. It has four vertices, eight edges and six 2-cells. Each 2-cell contains a boundary component of [formula]. There are four 2-cells which are bigons containing c0, c2, c4, and c5, respectively. There are two 2-cells which are squares containing c1 and c3, respectively. Each square has exactly one common edge with each of the four bigons. So there is a properly embedded arc γ'1 in S which connects holes c1 and c5, has exactly one intersection point with the common edge of the square containing c1 and the bigon containing c5, and is disjoint with B1. There is a properly embedded arc γ'2 in S which connects holes c1 and c0, has exactly one intersection point with the common edge of the square containing c1 and the bigon containing c0, and is disjoint with B1. Note that γ'1 and γ'2 correspond to two coedges of the cell decomposition. It is easy to make sure that we can choose the arcs γ'1 and γ'2 to be disjoint.

There is a diffeomorphism of [formula] which takes γ'1 and γ'2 to γ1 and γ2, respectively, where γ1 and γ2 are as shown in the left of Figure [\ref=fig:open_book_and_arc_a_shown2] and keeps B1 invariant. Such a diffeomorphism exists because the arcs γ'1 and γ'2 are chosen to be disjoint from the curve B1. We denote the image of B''2 under this diffeomorphism by B''2 still. Then I(B''2,γi) = 1 for i = 1,2.

We cut the surface [formula] open along [formula], and think of the resulting surface with the outer boundary drawn as a rectangle. To avoid confusion with other terminology used, we will denote this cut open surface by R. See the right of Figure [\ref=fig:open_book_and_arc_a_shown2]. The curve B''2 is cut open into two arcs. One of them has both endpoints in the left edge of R, and the other of them has both endpoints in the right edge of R. Since B1 is parallel to the outer boundary of R, each of the two arcs are either disjoint with B1 or has exactly two intersection points with B1. Since I(B1,B''2) = 4, both of the two arcs have exactly two intersection points with B1. One of them encloses one hole of c2 and c4 with a subarc of the left edge of R. The other of them encloses the other hole of c2 and c4 with a subarc of the right edge of R.

Just as in the proofs of Lemma [\ref=lemma_uniqueness_of_positive_factorization] and Lemma [\ref=general_uniqueness_of_factorization], we get that there are at most two choices for B''2. Hence, τB1τB2 has at most two positive factorizations up to a global conjugation.

Stein fillings of certain planar open books

Now we go back to the proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem_factorization_of_mapping_class].

Suppose [formula] are k - 1 properly embedded pairwise disjoint arcs in Σ which satisfy that: 1) ai connects the boundary components ci and ci + 1, 2) ai is disjoint with B1 and B2. Suppose [formula] are n - k - 1 properly embedded pairwise disjoint arcs in Σ which satisfy that: 1) bi connects the boundary components ci and ci + 1, 2) bi is disjoint with B1 and B2.

If p = q = 1, then by Lemma [\ref=lemma_combinatorial], any other positive factorization of Φ must be the product of τm11, τm22, [formula], τmnn, τmn + 2n + 2, τB'1 and τB'2, where the curves B'1 and B'2 enclose the same set of holes as curves B1 and B2, respectively. In particular, either τB1τB2  =  τB'1τB'2 or τB1τB2  =  τB'2τB'1. Without loss of generality, we assume that τB1τB2  =  τB'1τB'2.

Since the curves B1 and B2 do not intersect any of the arcs ai, the diffeomorphism τB1τB2 does not move them. It follows that the diffeomorphism τB'1τB'2 does not move any of the arcs ai as well. We claim that the curves B'1 and B'2 do not intersect any of the arcs ai. Suppose one of the curves B'1,B'2 intersects the arc ai for some i. Without loss of generality we can assume that curve to be B'2. In this case, since any positive Dehn twist is right veering(see [\cite=HKM_Right_Veering_1]), the diffeomorphism τB'2 will move the arc ai strictly to the right. Hence, τB'1 should move the arc ai strictly to the left, which is impossible. Similarly, the curves B'1 and B'2 do not intersect any of the arcs bi.

Since the arcs ai and bi are not moved by the diffeomorphism τB'1τB'2, we can cut along arcs ai and bi. If we do that we are left with the surface [formula], [formula] or [formula], depending on k and n. We still denote the curves by B1,B2,B'1,B'2 in this new surface. As before, there is a diffeomorphism which sends B'1 to B1, and B'2 to B''2. Now from Lemmas [\ref=lemma_uniqueness_of_positive_factorization],  [\ref=general_uniqueness_of_factorization] and  [\ref=more_general_uniqueness_of_factorization] it follows that there are at most two factorizations, up to a global conjugation, of the monodromy given by two different choices for the curve B''2.

From the Kirby diagrams, see Figure [\ref=fig:Kirby_diagrams] for an example, we know that for both of these two choices of the curve B''2, the manifold supported by the open book decomposition

[formula]

is diffeomorphic to the original oriented 3-manifold, and their corresponding Stein fillings are diffeomorphic. According to Theorem [\ref=Wendl_Planar_open_books], Theorem [\ref=theorem_factorization_of_mapping_class] holds in this special case.

Now we are left to prove the general case. Any other factorization of Φ is

[formula]

up to a global conjugation, where B'1 and B'2 enclose the same boundary components as B1 and B2, respectively. In particular, either τB1τB2  =  τB'1τB'2 or τB1τB2  =  τB'2τB'1. Without loss of generality, we assume that τB1τB2  =  τB'1τB'2.

Suppose [formula] are p - 1 properly embedded pairwise disjoint arcs in Σ which satisfy that: 1) ui connects the boundary components ci and ci + 1, 2) ui is disjoint with B1 and B2. Suppose [formula] are q - 1 properly embedded pairwise disjoint arcs in Σ which satisfy that: 1) vi connects the boundary components ci and ci + 1, 2) vi is disjoint with B1 and B2.

Note that the diffeomorphism τB1τB2 does not move any of the arcs [formula] un + q + p - 1,vk, [formula] and so τB'1τB'2 does not move these arcs either. By the same argument as in previous paragraph, the curves B'1 and B'2 do not intersect arcs [formula] un + q + p - 1,vk, [formula].

Hence, to factorize Φ we need to specify curves B'1 and B'2 in the complement of arcs [formula] un + q + p - 1,vk, [formula]. So we cut the surface along arcs un + q + 1, [formula], un + q + p - 1, vk, [formula], vk + q - 2, and what left is a planar surface with n + 3 boundary components. Also, there is a diffeomorphism which sends B'1 to B1, and B'2 to B''2.

By Lemma [\ref=lemma_uniqueness_of_positive_factorization], Lemma [\ref=general_uniqueness_of_factorization] and Lemma [\ref=more_general_uniqueness_of_factorization], there are at most two factorizations, up to a global conjugation, of the monodromy given by two different choices for the curve B''2. Considering the Kirby diagrams, we know that the two Stein fillings are diffeomorphic. This finishes the proof by Theorem [\ref=Wendl_Planar_open_books].

Proofs of the corollaries

Let L' be a Legendrian twist knot K- 2p with Thurston-Bennequin invariant - n and rotation number n - 2k + 1. According to [\cite=Li_Wang_support_genera_of_legendrian_knots], we can embed the Legendrian link in Figure [\ref=fig:Legendrian_surgery_diagram_for_infinite_family1] into a page of an embedded open book supporting (S3,ξstd). See Figure [\ref=fig:embedded_open_book]. In the figure, L' denotes a Legendrian twist knot K- 2p and [formula] denote Legendrian unknots with tb =  - 1 and rot  =  0 embedded in the page of an open book decomposition supporting (S3,ξstd).

The embedded open book supporting (S3,ξstd) depicted in Figure [\ref=fig:embedded_open_book] can be transformed into an abstract version (Σ,φ) shown in Figure [\ref=fig:p14], with q = 1 and

[formula]

The embedded open book depicted in Figure [\ref=fig:embedded_open_book] can be obtained from the open book supporting (S3,ξstd), whose binding is an unknot, by plumbing finitely many positive Hopf bands successively. It is easy to see that an embedded open book with an unknot as binding can be transformed to an abstract version whose page is a disk and monodromy is the identity. Recall that plumbing a positive Hopf band either increases the genus of the page by 1 or increases the number of boundary components by 1, depending on the way in which the 1-handle is attached. See [\cite=Etnyre_Lectures_on_open_book_decompositions] for details. In this proof, each plumbing is done so that we increase only the number of boundary components. With this set up, one can plumb the positive Hopf bands in the order that creates the boundary components c1, [formula], ck - 1, ck, ck + 1, [formula], cn, cn + 2, [formula], cn + p + 1, and cn + 1 one after another.

Suppose an embedded open book (∂S1,π1) with page S1 supporting (S3,ξstd) is transformed into an abstract version (Σ1,φ) through a diffeomorphism from S1 to Σ1, and an embedded open book (∂S2,π2) with page S2 is obtained from (∂S1,π1) by plumbing a positive Hopf band along a properly embedded arc a  ⊂  S1. By the definition of plumbing, the positive Hopf band is attached at the two end points of the arc a, so that the union of arc a and the core of the positive Hopf band is a simple closed curve which can be pushed away from the page S1 and does not link with ∂S1. Note that the isotopy class of the resulted embedded open book (∂S2,π2) does not depend on the choice of the interior of a. We denote by a, still, the properly embedded arc in the page of abstract open book (Σ1,φ) which is the image of the arc a in S1. Then we can transform the embedded open book (∂S2,π2) into an abstract version (Σ2,φ  ·  τc), where Σ2 is obtained from Σ1 by adding a 1-handle at the two end points of the arc a, and the simple closed curve c  ⊂  Σ2, called a stabilizing curve, is the union of the arc a  ⊂  Σ1 and the core of the attached 1-handle. The abstract open book (Σ2,φ  ·  τc) is a positive stabilization of (Σ1,φ).

It is easy to draw the arcs along which the positive Hopf bands are plumbed to obtain the embedded open book in Figure [\ref=fig:embedded_open_book]. Following the local transformation process in the order of plumbing mentioned above, we obtain an abstract version of the open book decomposition in Figure [\ref=fig:embedded_open_book] as shown in Figure [\ref=fig:abstract_open_book_twist_knot], with L' being a Legendrian twist knot K- 2p in (S3,ξstd). By definition, each positive Hopf band corresponds to a stabilizing curve. For [formula], there is a stabilizing curve for open book decomposition supporting (S3,ξstd) which is parallel to the i-th boundary component. Moreover, the curve α is also a stabilizing curve for open book decomposition supporting (S3,ξstd) which corresponds to the top positive Hopf band in Figure [\ref=fig:embedded_open_book] that creates the boundary component cn + 1.

It is easy to see that there is a diffeomorphism taking the surface in Figure [\ref=fig:abstract_open_book_twist_knot] to the one in Figure [\ref=fig:p14] when q = 1. Under this diffeomorphism the curves L',α in Figure [\ref=fig:abstract_open_book_twist_knot] become the curves B2,B1 in Figure [\ref=fig:p14].

So the contact structure (M',ξ') is supported by the open book (Σ,Φ) with q = 1 and

[formula]

where [formula] for [formula].

By Theorem [\ref=theorem_factorization_of_mapping_class], (M',ξ') admits a unique Stein filling up to diffeomorphism.

The open book

[formula]

corresponds to (S3,ξstd). If we transform it to the embedded version which is similar to Figure [\ref=fig:embedded_open_book], then B2 can be realized as a Legendrian 2-bridge knot B(p,q) topologically shown in Figure [\ref=fig:2-bridge_knots]. By Lemma [\ref=lemma:knot_stabilization], it is the result of n - k positive stabilizations and k - 1 negative stabilizations of a Legendrian 2-bridge knot B(p,q) with Thurston-Bennequin invariant - 1 and rotation number 0. So by Theorem [\ref=theorem_factorization_of_mapping_class], the contact 3-manifold which is obtained by Legendrian surgery on (S3,ξstd) along the Legendrian B2 admits a unique Stein filling up to diffeomorphism.

Uniqueness of certain Stein fillings up to symplectic deformation equivalence

Since L is a Legendrian twist knot K- 2p with Thurston-Bennequin invariant - 1 and rotation number 0, we can embed Sn - k+Sk - 1-(L) into a page of an embedded open book decomposition supporting (S3,ξstd) as in Figure [\ref=fig:embedded_open_book], where the page is a compact planar surface with n + p + 2 boundary components. By Lemma [\ref=embed_to_abstract], we can transform this embedded open book decomposition into an abstract version (Σ,φ) with q = 1 and

[formula]

The Legendrian surgery on (S3,ξstd) along the stabilization Sn - k+Sk - 1-(L) yields a contact structure ξk on the 3-manifold S3- 1 - n(K- 2p), which is supported by the open book decomposition (Σ,Φ) with q = 1 and

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=lemma_combinatorial], any positive factorization of Φ has to be the product of τ1, τ2, [formula], τn, τn + 2, [formula], τn + p + 1, τB'1, τB'2, where B'1 and B'2 enclose the same set of holes as B1 and B2, respectively.

The open book decomposition

[formula]

also supports (S3,ξstd). We think of B'2 as a knot in (S3,ξstd).

We claim that B'2 is isotopic to the twist knot K- 2p. There is an element f∈Map(Σ,∂Σ) which sends B'1 to B1. We denote f(B'2) by B''2. According to the proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem_factorization_of_mapping_class], the given monodromy Φ has at most two different positive factorizations, up to a global conjugation, depending on the two choices for B''2. Both of the two choices of B''2 are isotopic to the twist knot K- 2p. So B'2 is isotopic to the twist knot K- 2p.

We compute the page framing of B'2 in the open book decomposition

[formula]

To this end, we compute the linking number of B''2 and its push-off in the page of open book decomposition

[formula]

shown in Figure [\ref=fig:embedded_open_book]. For both of the two choices of B''2, it is routine to check that the linking numbers of B''2 and its push-off in the page are - n. So B'2 has page framing - n with respect to the Seifert framing.

Since B'2 is not null-homologous in Σ, we can Legendrian realize it. According to the definition of open book decomposition, we know that the Thurston-Bennequin invariant of B'2 is the difference between the page framing and the Seifert framing, that is, - n.

Therefore, the Lefschetz fibration X over D2, with fiber Σ, corresponding to the positive factorization [formula] of Φ is diffeomorphic to D4, with its standard complex structure, and a 2-handle attached along a ( - 1 - n)-framed twist knot K- 2p. Also, X has a Stein structure that arises from the Legendrian surgery along the Legendrian realized B'2. By a theorem of Eliashberg [\cite=Eliashberg_Stein_handle_attachment], we can extend the Stein structure uniquely to this new manifold. Since there is a unique Legendrian twist knot K- 2p with Thurston-Bennequin invariant - n and rotation number n - 2k + 1, [\cite=Etnyre_Ng_Vertesi_Twist_knots_classification], we know that the only Legendrian twist knot K- 2p that can produce (S3- 1 - n(K- 2p),ξk) is Sn - k+Sk - 1-(L). This implies that all Stein structures on X are symplectic deformation equivalent. So X has a unique Stein structure up to symplectic deformation.

According to Theorem [\ref=Wendl_Planar_open_books], every Stein filling of (S3- 1 - n(K- 2p),ξk) is symplectic deformation equivalent to a Lefschetz fibration compatible with the given planar open book decomposition (Σ,Φ). So there is a unique Stein filling on (S3- 1 - n(K- 2p),ξk), up to symplectic deformation.
