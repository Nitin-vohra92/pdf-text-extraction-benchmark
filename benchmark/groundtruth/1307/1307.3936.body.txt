Spectroscopy of fullerenes, fulleranes and PAHs in the UV, visible and near infrared spectral range

C60 and C70 fullerenes display quite complex spectra in the ultraviolet and visible spectral regions due to the electronic transitions of the π electrons of their weakly conjugated double bonds. C60 shows two intense bands at 213 and 257 nm, respectively, with a molar extiction coefficient ε of 135000 and 175000 L cm- 1 mol- 1, respectively. Other bands of C60 appear at 329 nm (ε = 51000 L cm- 1 mol- 1), 404 nm and a broad and relatively weak band between 440 and 670 nm with subfeatures at 500, 540, 570, 600 and 625 nm. Similarly, also the electronic absorption spectrum of C70 is characterized by two intense transitions at 210 and 228 nm followed by a series of weak electronic transitions at 327, 358 and 375 nm and by a weak and broad band at 460 nm. Both C60 and C70 fullerenes are extremely reactive and avid of atomic hydrogen and it was demonstrated experimentally that C60 is transformed very quickly into the fullerane C60H36 when reacted with atomic hydrogen while C70 yields C70H38 (Cataldo & Iglesias-Groth 2009, 2010). The same reactivity is also shown by C60 and C70 with deuterium yielding the deuterated fulleranes analogous to the hydrogenated derivatives mentioned above (Cataldo et al. 2009a,b). The C60H36 fullerane displays an electronic absorpion spectrum with a unique absorption band at 217 nm with a molar extinction coefficient ε = 17140 L cm- 1 mol- 1 while C60D36 shows an analogous spectrum with a maximum at 217 nm and ε = 16480 L cm- 1 mol- 1 (Cataldo & Iglesias-Groth 2009; Cataldo et al. 2009c). It has been shown that the peak of C60H36 matches both in position and in width the UV bump of the interstellar light extinction curve (Cataldo & Iglesias-Groth 2009). It is interesting to note that also the hydrogenated and deuterated C70 under the form of C70H38 and C70D38 display an analogous UV spectrum as that shown by the hydrogenated and perdeuterated C60 derivatives. The peak position is found at 214 nm with ε = 6300 L cm- 1 mol- 1 in the case of C70H38 and ε = 5800 L cm- 1 mol- 1 in the case of C70D38 (Cataldo et al. 2009d). These results imply that hydrogenated and deuterated C60 and C70 fullerenes can be present in the interstellar medium and may contribute to the UV bump of the interstellar light extinction curve and may play a key role in molecular hydrogen formation in space starting from the atomic hydrogen adsorption on the fullerene cage structure and release as molecular hydrogen under UV irradiation (Cataldo & Iglesias-Groth 2010). Indeed, it was shown experimentally (Cataldo & Iglesias-Groth 2009; Cataldo et al. 2009c,d) that the UV irradiation of fulleranes, the hydrogenated fullerenes, causes the release of molecular hydrogen and the consequent partial dehydrogenation of the fullerane with a shift of the electronic transition at 217 nm toward longer wavelengths. Another characteristic property of hydrogenated/deuterated fullerenes regards the kinetic isotope effect observed experimentally during the photolysis, which involves an easier photolysis of the C-H bond in comparison to the C-D bond with the consequent possible H/D fractionation on the fullerene surface (Cataldo & Iglesias-Groth 2009; Cataldo et al. 2009c,d).

In the interstellar medium under the action of cosmic rays or other radiation, C60 may undergo ionization losing one electron and yielding a radical cation. In laboratory the radical cation spectrum of C60 was produced in a very high oxidizing medium known as oleum (Cataldo et al. 2012a) and the resulting electronic transitions were found in the near-infrared at 823.7 nm and at 931.5 nm. The latter transition was interpreted as the true radical cation transition of C60. On the other hand, under the same conditions the radical cation of C70 displays its longest wavelength transition at about 640 nm (Cataldo et al. 2012a). When hydrogenated C60 and C70 are dissolved in the same medium that generates C60+ . and C70+ ., it happens that they undergo an almost complete dehydrogenation, displaying once again the bands of the radical cation spectra (Cataldo et al. 2009b, 2012b): C60H36 +   oleum →   C60+ . +   18H2 and C70H38 +   oleum →   C70+ . +   19H2.

An attempt to record the radical cation spectra of higher fullerenes like C76, C78 and C84 in oleum was also made but the results show only weak and broad transitions in the near infrared that may suggest that higher fullerenes once oxidized to the radical cation stage undergo further oxidative decomposition (at least in oleum) (Cataldo et al. 2012a).

Although less probable than the radical cation formation, it is expected that in space C60 and C70 fullerenes may produce also the radical anion (Cataldo et al. 2013a). The radical anion spectrum of C60 is characterized by a complex band pattern, showing a series of peaks at 935, 994, 1032 and 1058 nm while the radical anion spectrum of C70 shows only a broad band with a peak in the range comprised between 814 and 840 nm.

The infrared spectra of a series of reference fullerenes and fulleranes have been recorded in the laboratory by Iglesias-Groth et al. (2011, 2012) together with the relative molar absorptivity. This recent laboratory spectroscopy of C60 and C70 fullerenes has permitted an accurate determination of the fullerene abundances in space (García-Hernández et al. 2011, 2012). In addition, because the reference spectra of hydrogenated fullerenes (fulleranes) are now available, a search for these molecular species can now be made in space, and their possible detection in astrophysical environments may be only a matter of time and luck.

Very large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (VLPAHs) are not easily accessible but of high interest as reference molecules for the explanation of the diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs). Using the Scholl reaction, Cataldo et al. (2011) have synthesized a series of VLPAHs, ranging from dicoronylene to quaterrylene to hexabenzocoronene. Dicoronylene was also obtained by the thermal dimerization of coronene. If the thermal treatment of coronene is prolonged, then the oligomerization of coronene proceeds further, yielding a black oligomer, which is probably a trimer or a higher homologue. It is shown that from coronene oligomerization it is possible to build a sheet of graphene.

The radical cation spectra of a series of normal PAHs and VLPAHs were studied by Cataldo et al. (2010) using oleum as oxidizing medium. PAHs and VLPAHs in the harsh space conditions are expected to undergo ionization, being mainly in the form of radical cations. The radical cation spectra of PAHs and VLPAHs are characterized by intense electronic transitions, which in our laboratory conditions appear as relatively broad bands but in the gas phase and at relatively lower temperature such electronic transition must appear as sharp and narrow bands. Thus, it is possible that some DIBs could be associated to the radical cation transitions of some PAHs or, even better, to some VLPAHs. It could be useful to mention here some of the results reported in the work of Cataldo et al. (2010). First of all the PAHs and VLPAHs once oxidized to the radical cation display electronic transitions in the visible and in the near infrared and may be associated to certain DIBs. The anthracene radical cation shows its longest wavelength transition (LWT) at 588.2 nm, tetracene radical cation LWT = 652.8 nm, pentacene radical cation LWT = 760.4 nm, pyrene radical cation LWT = 556 and 602 nm, coronene radical cation LWT = 574 nm, dicoronylene radical cation LWT = 755 nm, coronene oligomer radical cation LWT = 881 nm, perylene radical cation LWT = 515 nm and quaterrylene radical cation LWT = 811 and 838 nm. Finally, far infrared spectroscopy on a series of PAHs, VLPAHs and petroleum and coal fractions were also reported in recent works by Cataldo et al. (2013b,c).
