Construction of Hamiltonian-stationary Lagrangian submanifolds of constant curvature ε in complex space forms n(4ε)

Introduction.

Let   n(4ε)   denote the complex projective n-space   CPn(4ε), the complex Euclidean n-space [formula] or the complex hyperbolic n-space CHn(4ε) according to ε > 0,  ε = 0 or ε < 0, respectively.

The Kaehler 2-form ω is defined by [formula], where J is the complex structure. An isometric immersion ψ:Mn  →  n(4ε) of an n-manifold M into n(4ε) is called Lagrangian if ψ*ω = 0 on M. A vector field X on n(4ε) is called Hamiltonian if LXω = fω for some smooth function f on n(4ε), where L is the Lie derivative. Thus, there exists a smooth real-valued function φ on n(4ε) such that X = Jφ, where [formula] is the gradient. The diffeomorphisms of the flux φt of X transform Lagrangian submanifolds into Lagrangian submanifolds.

A normal vector field ξ to a Lagrangian immersion ψ:Mn  →  n(4ε) is called Hamiltonian if [formula], where f is a smooth function on Mn and [formula] is the gradient of f with respect to the induced metric. If f∈C∞0(M) and ψt:M  →  n(4ε) is a variation of ψ with ψ0  =  ψ and variational vector field ξ, then the first variation of the volume functional is

[formula]

where H is the mean curvature vector of ψ and div is the divergence on Mn. Critical points of this variational functional are called H-stationary or Hamiltonian-stationary (cf. [\cite=Oh]). Among others, H-stationary Lagrangian submanifolds in complex space forms have been studied in [\cite=a3]-[\cite=cd], [\cite=cg]-[\cite=Oh].

An effective method using twisted products for constructing Lagrangian immersions of a real space form Mn(ε) into a complex space form n(4ε) was developed by Chen, Dillen, Verstraelen and Vrancken in [\cite=cdvv].

One main result of [\cite=cdvv] states that if the twistor form of a twisted product decomposition [formula] of a simply-connected real space form Mn(ε) of constant curvature ε is twisted closed, then it admits a "unique" adapted Lagrangian immersion:

[formula]

Conversely, if L:Mn(ε)  →  n(4ε) is a non-totally geodesic Lagrangian immersion, then Mn(ε) admits a twisted product decomposition with twisted closed twistor form; moreover, the Lagrangian immersion is given by the adapted Lagrangian immersion of the twisted product decomposition. A twisted product decomposition of a real space form is called a warped product decomposition if it is a warped product.

In this article we survey recent results concerning construction of Hamiltonian-stationary Lagrangian submanifolds in complex space forms using this effective method of [\cite=cdvv].

Preliminaries.

Basic notation and formulas

Let L:M  →  n(4) be an isometric immersion of a Riemannian n-manifold M into Mn(4). Denote the Riemannian connections of M and Mn(4) by [formula] and [formula], respectively; and by D the connection on the normal bundle of the submanifold. Let R denote the curvature tensor of [formula].

The formulas of Gauss and Weingarten are

[formula]

for tangent vector fields X,Y and normal vector field ξ.

If L:M  →  n(4) is a Lagrangian immersion, then the equations of Gauss and Codazzi are given respectively by

[formula]

where

[formula]

For the Lagrangian immersion we also have (cf. [\cite=CO])

[formula]

At a given point p on the Lagrangian submanifold M, the relative null space Np at p is the subspace of the tangent space TpM defined by

[formula]

The dimension of Np is called the relative nullity at p.

Lagrangian and Legendrian submanifolds.

We recall a general method from [\cite=R] for constructing Lagrangian submanifolds via Hopf's fibration.

Case (1): CPn(4). Let

[formula]

be the unit hypersphere in [formula] centered at the origin. On S2n + 1(1) we consider the canonical Sasakian structure consisting of φ induced from the complex structure J of [formula] and the structure vector field ξ = Jx with x being the position vector.

An isometric immersion ψ:  M  →  S2n + 1(1) is called Legendrian if ξ is normal to f*(TM) and [formula], where [formula] denotes the inner product on [formula]. The vectors of S2n + 1(1) normal to ξ at a point z define the horizontal subspace Hz of the Hopf fibration:

[formula]

Let ψ̂:  M  →  CPn(4) be a Lagrangian isometric immersion. Then there is an isometric covering map τ:    →  M and a Legendrian immersion ψ:    →  S2n + 1(1) such that ψ̂(τ) = π(ψ). Hence every Lagrangian immersion can be lifted locally (or globally if we assume the manifold is simply connected) to a Legendrian immersion of the same Riemannian manifold.

Conversely, suppose that ψ:    →  S2n + 1(1) is a Legendrian immersion. Then ψ̂  =  π(ψ):  M  →  CPn(4) is a Lagrangian isometric immersion. Under this correspondence, the second fundamental forms hψ and hψ̂ of ψ and ψ̂ satisfy π*hψ = hψ̂. We shall denote hψ and hψ̂ simply by h.

Case (2): CHn( - 4). Consider the complex number space [formula] with the pseudo Euclidean metric: [formula]. Put

[formula]

where [formula] is the inner product on [formula] induced from g0.

Put

[formula]

and

[formula]

Then we have an H11-action on H2n + 11( - 1), z  ↦  λz and at each point z∈H2n + 11( - 1), the vector iz is tangent to the flow of the action. Since the metric g0 is Hermitian, we have [formula]. The orbit lies in the negative definite plane spanned by z and iz. The quotient space H2n + 11  /    ~  , under the identification from the action, is the complex hyperbolic space CHn( - 4) with holomorphic sectional curvature - 4, with the complex structure J induced from the canonical complex structure J on [formula] via the following pseudo-Riemannian submersion:

[formula]

Just as in Case (1), let g:  M  →  CHn( - 4) be a Lagrangian isometric immersion. Then there exists an isometric covering map τ:    →  M, and a Legendrian isometric immersion f:    →  H2n + 11( - 1) such that g(τ) = π(f). Hence every Lagrangian immersion can be lifted locally to a Legendrian immersion.

Conversely, let f:  →  H2n + 11( - 1) be a Legendrian immersion. Then g = π(f):  M  →  CHn( - 4) is again a Lagrangian isometric immersion. Similarly, under this correspondence, the second fundamental forms hf and hg of f and g satisfy π*hf = hg. We shall also denote hf and hg simply by h.

Assume that M is a submanifold of S2n + 1(1) or H2n + 11( - 1). Denote by [formula] and [formula] the Levi-Civita connections of [formula] or [formula] and of M, respectively. Let h be the second fundamental form of M in S2n + 1(1) or H2n + 11( - 1). Then we have

[formula]

where x is the position vector of M in [formula] or in [formula]; and ε = 1 or - 1, according to the ambient space being [formula] or being [formula], respectively.

Warped product decompositions and H-stationary.

Let [formula] be m Riemannian manifolds, fi a positive function on [formula] and [formula] the i-th canonical projection for [formula] The twisted product

[formula]

is the product manifold [formula] equipped with the twisted product metric g defined by

[formula]

Let [formula] be an [formula]-dimensional real space form of constant curvature ε. For [formula] we consider the following twisted product:

[formula]

with twisted product metric given by

[formula]

where g0 is the canonical metric of [formula] and [formula] are open intervals. When [formula], we shall replace Nn - 1(ε) by an open interval. If the twisted product is a real-space-form Mn(ε), it is called a twisted product decomposition of Mn(ε). We denote such a decomposition by [formula].

Coordinates [formula] on [formula] are called adapted coordinates if ∂  /  ∂xj is tangent to Ij for [formula], the last [formula] coordinate vectors are tangent to [formula], and if the metric takes the form .

The twistor form Φ(TP) on [formula] is defined by

[formula]

The twistor form is called twisted closed if we have (cf. [\cite=cdvv])

[formula]

Obviously, if [formula], the twisted form Φ(TP) is twisted closed automatically.

[\cite=cdvv] Let [formula] be a twisted product decomposition of a simply-connected real-space-form Mn(ε). If the twistor form Φ(TP) is twisted closed, then, up to rigid motions of n(4ε), there is a unique Lagrangian immersion:

[formula]

whose second fundamental form satisfies

[formula]

for any adapted coordinate system [formula].

Conversely, if   L:Mn(ε)  →  n(4ε)   is a non-totally geodesic Lagrangian immersion of a real-space-form Mn(ε) of constant curvature ε into a complex-space-form n(4ε), then Mn(ε) admits an appropriate twisted product decomposition with twisted closed twistor form and, moreover, the Lagrangian immersion L is given by the corresponding adapted Lagrangian immersion of the twisted product.

The H-stationary condition for the adapted Lagrangian immersion [formula] have been computed by Dong and Han in [\cite=DH].

Let [formula] be an adapted Lagrangian immersion given in Theorem [\ref=T:1]. Then [formula] is H-stationary if and only if the twistor functions [formula] satisfy

[formula]

An immediate consequence of this proposition is the following

[\cite=DH] Any adapted Lagrangian immersion Lff:TPnff(ε)  →  n(4ε) (with k = 2 and f1 = f2 = f) is H-stationary.

A twisted product decomposition [formula] of a real space form Mn(ε) is called a warped product decomposition if [formula] and [formula] are independent of the adapted coordinates [formula].

By applying Theorem [\ref=T:1] and Proposition [\ref=P:3.1], we also have the following (cf. [\cite=cd] [\cite=cg]).

Let TPnf1(ε) be a twisted product decomposition of a real space form Mn(ε) of constant curvature ε. Then the adapted Lagrangian immersion Lf1:TPnf1(ε)  →  n(4ε) is H-stationary if and only if TPnf1(ε) is a warped product decomposition.

If [formula] is a warped product decomposition of a simply-connected real space form Mn(ε), then up to rigid motions, there exists a unique H-stationary Lagrangian immersion

[formula]

whose second fundamental form satisfies .

H-stationary Lagrangian submanifolds arisen from warped product decompositions.

It follows from Proposition [\ref=P:3.3] that each warped decomposition of a real space space of constant curvature ε gives rise a Hamiltonian-stationary Lagrangian submanifold in a complex space form of constant holomorphic sectional curvature 4ε.

Hamiltonian-stationary Lagrangian submanifolds in complex space forms arisen from warped product decompositions have been completely classified by Chen and Dillen in [\cite=cd].

Type I Hamiltonian-stationary Lagrangian surfaces in 2(4ε).

For a twisted product decomposition TP2fk(ε) of a simply-connected surface of constant curvature ε, we have

[formula]

The twistor form Φ(TP) = f2dx2 + k2dy is twisted closed if and only if we have

[formula]

For [formula], Proposition [\ref=P:3.1] reduces to

[\cite=DH] Let Lfk:TP2fk(ε)  →  2(4ε) be an adapted Lagrangian immersion. Then Lfk is Hamiltonian-stationary if and only if we have

[formula]

Proposition [\ref=P:3.4] implies that the adapted Lagrangian immersion Lfk is always Hamiltonian-stationary whenever f2 = k2. We call such Hamiltonian-stationary Lagrangian surfaces to be of type I.

It was proved in [\cite=cdvv] that Hamiltonian-stationary Lagrangian surfaces of type I in CP2(4) are congruent to

[formula]

It is also known in [\cite=cdvv] that type I Hamiltonian-stationary Lagrangian immersions in [formula] are congruent to one of the following two immersions:

[formula]

For type I Hamiltonian-stationary Lagrangian immersions in CH2( - 4), it is known in [\cite=cdvv] that they are congruent to a Lagrangian surfaces obtained from one of the following five families:

where s = x + y and t = x - y.

Type II Hamiltonian-stationary Lagrangian surfaces in 2(4ε).

In this and next two sections, I present my recent joint work with O. J. Garay and Z. Zhou [\cite=cgz] concerning Hamiltonian-stationary Lagrangian surfaces of type II.

If the two twistor functions f and k are unequal, then the twisted product decomposition TP2fk(ε) of a surface of constant curvature ε gives rise to a H-stationary Lagrangian surface in 2(4ε) if and only if f and k satisfy the following over-determined PDE system:

[formula]

Hamiltonian-stationary Lagrangian immersions obtained from such functions f,k with f2  ≠  k2 are said to be of type II.

In order to find non-trivial solutions of this over-determined PDE system -, first we give the following two lemmas from [\cite=cgz].

If f(x,y) and k(x,y) satisfy Eqs. and , then

[formula]

satisfy Eqs. and automatically for any constant c  ≠  0.

The easiest way to obtain a solution of system - with f2  ≠  k2 is to start from f,k with f2 = k2 since is apparently satisfied, and and are in much simpler form.

If f(x,y) is a solution of system - with f2 = k2, then

[formula]

for some function (x + y) which is a traveling wave solution with unit traveling speed. In addition, we have a family of solutions of the system - given by

[formula]

where m is any positive constant.

Now, we can apply Lemma [\ref=L:6.2] to construct some nontrivial traveling wave solutions of the over-determined PDE system - with f2  ≠  k2.

H-stationary surfaces arisen from traveling wave solutions.

We are able to construct type II Hamiltonian-stationary Lagrangian surfaces in 2(4ε) using the traveling wave solutions.

First, let us consider the twisted product decomposition with

[formula]

The horizontal lift L̂ of the corresponding H-stationary Lagrangian immersion L satisfies the following PDE system:

[formula]

Solving this system gives the following family of Hamiltonian-stationary Lagrangian surfaces in CP2(4):

[formula]

Next, let us consider the following twisted product flat metric:

[formula]

The corresponding H-stationary Lagrangian immersion L satisfies the following PDE system:

[formula]

Solving this system yields the following new family of flat H-stationary Lagrangian surfaces in C2:

[formula]

where b,m are real numbers with 0 < m  ≠  1. In particular, if b = 0, we obtain the following new family of H-stationary surfaces:

[formula]

For CH2( - 4) we obtain the following:

[\cite=cgz] There exist five families of Hamiltonian-stationary surfaces of type II in CH2( - 4) arisen the traveling wave solutions:

[formula]

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula].

Complete solutions of system - for ε = 0.

It is quite difficult to find all exact solutions of the over-determined system. Fortunately, we are able to solve it for the case ε = 0.

[\cite=cgz] The solutions {f,k} of the following over-determined PDE system:

[formula]

are the following:

[formula]

where a,b,c,m are real numbers with a,c,m  ≠  0 and m  ≠    ±  1.

The H-stationary Lagrangian surfaces of type II in [formula] corresponding to solutions can also be completely determined as follows:

[formula]

for a > 0,  c  ≠  0, where r,θ and x,y are related by

[formula]

and Jν(z) is the Bessel function of the first kind with index ν, which can be expressed the following infinite series:

[formula]

.

Some applications.

As an application of the results in section 7, we mention the following classification result from [\cite=cg].

There exist five families of Hamiltonian-stationary Lagrangian submanifolds of constant curvature with positive relative nullity in the complex projective 3-space CP3(4):

(1) A totally geodesic Lagrangian submanifold given by L:RP3(1)  →  CP3;

(2) A Lagrangian submanifold defined by

[formula]

where a,b,c are real numbers and

[formula]

(3) A Lagrangian submanifold defined by

[formula]

where b is a positive number;

(4) A Lagrangian submanifold defined by

[formula]

where a,b are positive numbers.

(5) A Lagrangian submanifold defined by

[formula]

where [formula] is a horizontal lift of a type II Hamiltonian-stationary Lagrangian surface L:TP2fk(1)  →  CP2(4).

Conversely, locally every Hamiltonian-stationary Lagrangian submanifold of constant curvature in CP3 with positive relative nullity is congruent to an open portion of a Lagrangian submanifold from one of the above five families.

For Hamiltonian-stationary Lagrangian submanifolds in CH3, we have the following result from [\cite=c5].

There exist ten families of Hamiltonian-stationary Lagrangian submanifolds of constant curvature in CH3( - 4) with positive relative nullity:

(1) A totally geodesic Lagrangian submanifold L:H3( - 1)  →  CH3( - 4);

where P̃ is a horizontal lift of a type II Hamiltonian-stationary Lagrangian surface L:TPnf2k2( - 1)  →  CH2( - 4) via the Hopf fibration π:H51( - 1)  →  CH2( - 4).

Conversely, locally every Hamiltonian-stationary Lagrangian submanifold of constant curvature in CH3( - 4) with positive relative nullity is congruent to an open portion of a Lagrangian submanifold from one of the above tex families.

(Added on July 13, 2013) The PDE system (A) given in Theorem 8.1 was completely solved in [\cite=c12]. In particular, it was proved in [\cite=c12] that the PDE system admits only traveling wave solutions, whenever ε  ≠  0.
