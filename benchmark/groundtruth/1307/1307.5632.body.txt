Handlebody-knot invariants derived from unimodular Hopf algebras

and Akira Masuoka

Introduction

A handlebody-knot is a handlebody embedded in the 3-sphere S3; it is alternatively called a knotted handlebody or a spatial handlebody. A handlebody-link is a disjoint union of handlebodies embedded in S3. Two handlebody-links are equivalent if there exists an isotopy of S3 which takes one to the other, or equivalently if there exists an orientation-preserving self-homeomorphism of S3 which sends one to the other. The aim of this paper is to establish a uniform method to construct invariants for handlebody-links.

A handlebody-knot was first introduced as a neighborhood equivalence class of a spatial graph by Suzuki [\cite=Suzuki70]. Since neighborhood equivalence classes of knots coincide with ambient isotopy classes of knots, genus 1 handlebody-knots correspond to knots, which means that a handlebody-knot is a generalization of a knot. Study of knots with invariants has made great progress since the discovery of the Jones polynomial and the subsequent so-called quantum invariants; see, for example, [\cite=Ohtsuki02]. Quantum invariants are derived from representations of quantum groups. Superiority of a quantum invariant is that it can be derived from any representation of any quantum group. A functor from the category of tangles to that of vector spaces, which is obtained via a representation of a quantum group, gives a quantum invariant of tangles, especially of links.

Invariants of handlebody-links can be realized as those of spatial trivalent graphs which are invariant under IH-moves [\cite=Ishii08], where an IH-move is a local move on spatial trivalent graphs. When a handlebody-link H is a regular neighborhood of a spatial graph K, we say that H is represented by K. In this paper trivalent graphs may contain circle components. Then any handlebody-link can be represented by some spatial trivalent graph. The existence of trivalent vertices distinguishes mostly handlebody-links from ordinary links, and gives us the biggest barrier when we construct functors on handlebody-tangles. In order to get over this barrier, we introduce quantum-commutative quantum-symmetric algebras (see Definition [\ref=def:q-symmetric-alg]), and assign the multiplication mapping to a trivalent vertex. Then invariance under IH-moves follows from the associativity of multiplication. We obtain an invariant for handlebody-links with every quantum-commutative quantum-symmetric algebra. A good example of quantum-commutative quantum-symmetric algebras is given by finite-dimensional unimodular Hopf algebras, which include finite groups as the simplest example. Our invariant derived from a finite group coincides with the number of the homomorphisms from the fundamental group of the exterior of a handlebody-knot to the group.

We remark that Mizusawa and Murakami [\cite=MizusawaMurakami14] constructed quantum Uq(sl2) type invariants for handlebody-knots in S3 via Yokota's invariants [\cite=Yokota96].

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the category T of handlebody-tangles and present it by generators and relations; the result enables us to construct on T the functors which gives our invariants. In Section 3, we introduce the notion of quantum-commutative quantum-symmetric algebras and see how the invariants are obtained from those algebras. In Section 4, we focus on quantum-commutative quantum-symmetric algebras in the categories of Yetter-Drinfeld modules and show that every finite-dimensional unimodular Hopf algebra A is a quantum-commutative quantum-symmetric algebra in the category of Yetter-Drinfeld modules over A. In Section 5, we investigate the invariants derived from unimodular Hopf algebras in some algebraic and geometric situations such as the disk sum or the mirror image. In Sections 6 and 7, we give examples of invariants derived from unimodular Hopf algebras together with their data needed to compute the invariants.

The category of handlebody-tangles

A handlebody-tangle is a disjoint union of handlebodies embedded in a cube I3 such that the intersection of the handlebodies and the boundary of I3 is the union of sequences of disks in the top and bottom squares as shown in Figure [\ref=fig:handlebody-tangle]. We call the disks in the top (resp. bottom) square the top (resp. bottom) end disks of the handlebody-tangle. Two handlebody-tangles are assumed to be the same if one can be transformed into the other by an isotopy of I3 preserving the order of the end disks in the top and bottom squares. We remark that a handlebody-tangle with no end disks corresponds to a handlebody-link.

We define a strict tensor category T of handlebody-tangles as follows. The objects of T consist of finite sequences of disks. We denote by the number n the sequence of n disks. Then [formula]. The morphisms of T are handlebody-tangles. The source s(T) and the target b(T) of a handlebody-tangle T with m top end disks and n bottom end disks are defined by s(T) = n and b(T) = m. The identity morphism [formula] of an object n is the equivalence class of the trivial handlebody-tangle with n top end disks and n bottom end disks, where the trivial handlebody-tangle is the direct product of disks and the interval I as shown in the right picture of Figure [\ref=fig:handlebody-tangle]. We remark that the identity morphism [formula] is the empty set. For handlebody-tangles T,T' such that s(T) = b(T'), the composition [formula] of T and T' is the handlebody-tangle obtained by placing T on top of T' and gluing the bottom end disks of T and the top end disks of T' as shown in the left picture of Figure [\ref=fig:composition_tensor]. Then T is a category. We equip T with a tensor product as follows. For objects m, n of T, we define [formula]. For handlebody-tangles T,T', the tensor product [formula] is the handlebody-tangle obtained by placing T' to the right of T as show in the right picture of Figure [\ref=fig:composition_tensor]. Then the handlebody-tangle category T equipped with the tensor product is a strict tensor category with the unit 0.

We give generators and relations for the strict tensor category T. Every morphism in T can be presented by the generators with the operations of composing and tensoring applied. Two morphisms are identical if and only if they, presented as above, deform to each other by using the relations. We refer the reader to [\cite=Kassel95] for details of generators and relations for a strict tensor category. Let   |  , [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], X, and [formula] be the handlebody-tangles depicted in Figure [\ref=fig:elementary_handlebody-tangle]. The following proposition immediately follows from Theorem 11 in [\cite=IshiharaIshii12].

The strict tensor category T is generated by the six morphisms

[formula]

and the relations

[formula]

where we have presented [formula] by the juxtaposition AB.

We improve below the presentation of T above into a more economical one, which will be crucial when we prove Proposition [\ref=prop:F_A1].

The strict tensor category T is generated by the five morphisms

[formula]

and the relations [\eqref=eq:old1], [\eqref=eq:old6], [\eqref=eq:old7], [\eqref=eq:old9], [\eqref=eq:old10], [\eqref=eq:old11] together with

[formula]

The five morphisms generate T since we have

[formula]

By this equality the relation [\eqref=eq:old4] turns into the relation

[formula]

We see that the conditions in Proposition [\ref=prop:new-relations] follow from those in Proposition [\ref=prop:old-relations]. To prove the converse it suffices to verify [\eqref=eq:old2], [\eqref=eq:old3], [\eqref=eq:old5] and [\eqref=eq:old4']. This is done as follows.

[formula]

The following is now easy to see.

The tensor category T is braided with respect to the braiding depicted in Figure [\ref=fig:braiding].

Quantum-commutative quantum-symmetric algebras

In this section, [formula] denotes a braided tensor category unless otherwise stated. The braiding and its inverse will be denoted by, and depicted as where [formula]. Suppose that A is a (non-unital) algebra in B. Thus, A is equipped with a morphism in B which satisfies the associativity

[formula]

Here and in what follows we omit the associativity constraint in diagrams.

A (non-unital) algebra A in B, equipped with two morphisms is called a quantum-commutative quantum-symmetric algebra if it satisfies the selfduality [\eqref=eq:selfduality], the Frobenius property [\eqref=eq:Frobenius], the quantum-commutativity [\eqref=eq:q-commutativity] and the quantum-symmetry [\eqref=eq:q-symmetry], given below.

[formula]

These coincide respectively with [\eqref=eq:old1], [\eqref=eq:new1], [\eqref=eq:new5], [\eqref=eq:new2] given before, if the [formula] and X before read [formula] and cA,A, respectively.

In the braided tensor category T of handlebody-tangles, the object 1 equipped with [formula] is a quantum-commutative quantum-symmetric algebra.

If F:T  →  B is a braided tensor functor, then the object F(1), together with the morphisms which are given by [formula], [formula], [formula] composed with the tensor structure I≃F(0), [formula] of F, forms a quantum-commutative quantum-symmetric algebra in B.

This follows by Proposition [\ref=prop:new-relations].

This follows by a standard argument which depends on the fact that the notion of quantum-commutative quantum-symmetric algebras is tensor-categorical.

Assume that B is strict as a tensor category. Given a quantum-commutative quantum-symmetric algebra [formula] in B, there uniquely exists a braided strict tensor functor FA:T  →  B such that

[formula]

Define objects [formula] by

[formula]

and define a map [formula] by

[formula]

Then this F strictly preserves the tensor product.

Let us see that the relations in Proposition [\ref=prop:new-relations] with X, [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula] replaced by cA,A, c- 1A,A, mA, [formula], [formula] are satisfied. Since cA,A is a braiding, the relations [\eqref=eq:old7], [\eqref=eq:old9], [\eqref=eq:old10], [\eqref=eq:new3] and [\eqref=eq:new4] are satisfied; cf. Remark [\ref=rem:braided-alg] below. The rest is satisfied by the coincidence noted below [\eqref=eq:selfduality]-[\eqref=eq:q-symmetry] and since cA,A and c- 1A,A are inverses of each other.

It follows by [\cite=Kassel95] that the map F defined above gives rise uniquely to a strict tensor functor FA:T  →  B which satisfies the equalities in [\eqref=eq:braided-functor] as well as FA(X) = cA,A, [formula]. One sees easily that this FA preserves the braiding, and is indeed a unique functor such as described above.

Assume that B is strict, but is not necessarily braided. As was essentially shown above, if we have a (non-unital) algebra A in B equipped with morphisms [formula] which satisfy the relations in Proposition [\ref=prop:new-relations] except [\eqref=eq:old11], there uniquely exists a strict tensor functor FA:T  →  B which satisfies the equalities in [\eqref=eq:braided-functor] as well as FA(X) = cA,A, [formula]. In fact, it is essentially from such functors that Ishihara and the first author [\cite=IshiharaIshii12] constructed invariants of handlebody-knots. However, we choose, in this paper, to work with braided tensor categories, because the algebras of our main concern sit in such a category.

Suppose that B is braided. To modify the proposition above when B is not necessarily strict, let us say that a tensor functor F:T  →  B is almost strict, if it satisfies the following three conditions: (i) F(0) = I, (ii) if we set A = F(1), then for each n > 1, [formula], where [formula] is defined by [\eqref=eq:tensor-power], and (iii) the tensor structure φ0, φ2 of F is as follows,

[formula] is the identity [formula];

for every n,m > 0, [formula] is canonical in the sense that it is built from the associativity constraint [formula] and the identity [formula] by composing and tensoring; such an isomorphism is unique by MacLane's coherence theorem.

One sees from (a) that if n = 0 or m = 0, then φ2(n,m) must coincide with the left or right unit constraint [formula], [formula].

Given a quantum-commutative quantum-symmetric algebra [formula] in B, there uniquely exists a braided, almost strict tensor functor FA:T  →  B which satisfies the equalities given in [\eqref=eq:braided-functor].

For a tensor category B in general, a strict tensor category Bstr together with a strict tensor equivalence G:B  →  Bstr is constructed in [\cite=Kassel95].

Suppose we are in our special situation. It follows by the construction of [\cite=Kassel95] that for every n,m > 0, the unique canonical isomorphism [formula] is sent by G to the identity on [formula]. We can apply Remark [\ref=rem:braided-alg] to [formula] in Bstr. The result is translated via G so that the same result as in the remark holds true with "a strict tensor functor FA" replaced with "an almost strict tensor functor FA." This implies the desired result.

Given a quantum-commutative quantum-symmetric algebra A in a braided tensor category, FA(H) gives an invariant for handlebody-links H, which has values in the endomorphism monoid [formula].

This is a direct consequence of Proposition [\ref=prop:F_A2].

Quantum-commutative quantum-symmetric algebras in Yetter-Drinfeld modules

We will show that every finite-dimensional unimodular Hopf algebra over a field, regarded as an algebra in a braided tensor category of Yetter-Drinfeld modules, is a quantum-commutative quantum-symmetric algebra, which is unital.

In what follows we work over a fixed base field k; the tensor products [formula] denote those for vector spaces over k. Let A be a Hopf algebra with the coproduct [formula], the counit ε:A  →  k and the antipode S:A  →  A. For Δ, we will use the following variant of the Sweedler notation [\cite=Sweedler69]:

[formula]

For our purpose we may and we do assume that A is finite-dimensional. Then A includes the one-dimensional subspaces

[formula]

consisting of all left and resp., right integrals; see [\cite=Sweedler69]. It possibly happen that Il(A)  ≠  Ir(A).

A is said to be unimodular, if Il(A) = Ir(A).

The assumption dim A <   ∞   ensures that the antipode S is bijective; see [\cite=Sweedler69].

Given a left A-comodule V, we will write its structure, say [formula], explicitly so that

[formula]

Let [formula] denote the k-linear abelian, braided tensor category of Yetter-Drinfeld modules over A; see [\cite=Montgomery93]. Such a module is by definition a left A-module V given a left A-comodule structure [formula] which satisfies

[formula]

Morphisms in [formula] are A-linear and A-colinear maps. In [formula], the tensor product, the unit object (that is k), and the associativity and unit constraints are the obvious ones, being the same as those for left (co)modules. The braiding is defined by

[formula]

whose inverse is given by

[formula]

As is well known, the braided tensor category [formula] thus defined is naturally identified with that of left modules over the quantum double D(A); see [\cite=Montgomery93] or [\cite=Kassel95]. Though the latter category might be more familiar, the former is more suitable for our purpose. In the following section we will treat with the quantum double D(kG) of a finite group algebra kG, as an example of the present A.

We regard A as a left A-module with respect to the conjugate action [formula] defined by

[formula]

We regard A as a left A-comodule with respect to the coproduct [formula].

We have [formula]. Moreover, this A, equipped with the original algebra structure, turns into a unital algebra in [formula] which satisfies the quantum-commutativity [\eqref=eq:q-commutativity].

This is directly verified; the quantum-commutativity follows from [formula].

Continue to suppose that A is a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra. The dual vector space [formula] of A forms naturally a Hopf algebra (see [\cite=Sweedler69]), so that we have Il(A*), Ir(A*). We will use the following well-known fact; see Proposition 1 (e) and Corollary 1 of [\cite=Radford94a], for example.

Let λ be a non-zero left or right integral in A*.

If Λ is a left (resp., right) integral in A, then [formula] is a right (resp., left) integral in A, and [formula].

There exists uniquely a left or right integral Λ in A such that λ(Λ) = 1. It follows that the evaluation map [formula] and the analogous ones are all linear isomorphisms.

Choose 0  ≠  λ∈Il(A*), and define a bilinear form on A by

[formula]

The following is well known; see [\cite=Montgomery93].

This bilinear form is non-degenerate.

Choose bases (αi), (βi) of A which are dual to each other with respect to 〈 ~ , ~ 〉λ, so that 〈αi,βj〉λ  =  δij. Set

[formula]

This element is characterized by the property that

[formula]

for all a∈A.

Let 0  ≠  λ∈Il(A*) as above.

Let Λ be a unique right integral in A such that λ(Λ) = 1. Then

[formula]

Let Λ be a unique left integral in A such that λ(Λ) = 1. Then

[formula]

Since Λ∈Ir(A), we have

[formula]

To see that the element [formula] satisfies the first equation of [\eqref=eq:Ulambda], we have to show that for any a∈A, f∈A*,

[formula]

From [\eqref=eq:right-integral] and λ∈Il(A*), we see that this left-hand side equals

[formula]

as desired, where [formula] is defined by [formula], b∈A.

If Λ∈Il(A) with λ(Λ) = 1, then S- 1(Λ)∈Ir(A) with λ(S- 1(Λ)) = 1, by Proposition [\ref=prop:integral-integral] (1). Part 1 applied to S- 1(Λ) shows Part 2.

To continue our construction we define linear maps,

[formula]

Let [formula] denote the product on A. Then we have

[formula]

Obviously, [formula], [formula] defined above satisfy the selfduality [\eqref=eq:selfduality] and the Frobenius property [\eqref=eq:Frobenius].

Assume that A is unimodular.

[formula] and [formula] defined above are both morphisms in [formula].

The object [formula] in [formula], equipped with mA, [formula], [formula], is a quantum-commutative quantum-symmetric algebra in [formula].

First, we show, without the unimodularity assumption, that [formula] and [formula] are A-colinear. Since λ, regarded as a linear map A  →  k, is left A-colinear, it follows by [\eqref=eq:ev] that [formula] is A-colinear, since mA is obviously A-colinear. For [formula], let us use the expression of Uλ given by Lemma [\ref=lem:Ulambda] (1). Then the A-colinearity of [formula] follows since we see

[formula]

To show the remaining A-linearity, assume that A is unimodular. Let (Aop)cop denote the Hopf algebra A with the opposite product and coproduct; it has the same antipode as A, and our λ is a right integral in its dual Hopf algebra. Apply the equality (a) of [\cite=Radford94a] to this (Aop)cop. Since the unimodularity assumption implies that the α in that equality equals ε, it follows that

[formula]

Since the product mA is obviously A-linear, it follows by [\eqref=eq:ev] that in order to prove the A-linearity of [formula], it suffices to see that λ:A  →  k is A-linear. In fact, this holds true, since we see from [\eqref=eq:commutator] that for a,b∈A, The A-linearity of [formula] will follow if one sees, using the same expression of Uλ as above, that for every a∈A,

[formula]

Use [\eqref=eq:right-integral] and the analogous equation

[formula]

which holds since Λ∈Il(A). Then we see that the left-hand side of the desired equation equals

[formula]

which is seen to equal the right-hand side.

It remains to verify the quantum-symmetry. By [\eqref=eq:ev], this desired property follows from the quantum-commutativity which was verified by Lemma [\ref=lem:YD-alg].

The construction above is generalized as follows. Suppose that A, L are finite-dimensional Hopf algebras, and that B is an (L,A)-biGalois object, that is, an (L,A)-bicomodule algebra which is a Galois extension [\cite=Montgomery93] over k on both sides. Choose 0  ≠  λ∈Il(A*), and define 〈b,c〉λ = b(0)c(0)λ(b(1)c(1)) for b,c∈B, where [formula] denotes the right A-comodule structure on B. Then one can prove that this last defines indeed a bilinear form 〈 ~ , ~ 〉λ:B  ×  B  →  k which is non-degenerate. By the same procedure as above, we see that if A is unimodular, then B turns into a quantum-commutative quantum-symmetric algebra in [formula], where the left L-module structure on B is given by the so-called Miyashita-Ulbrich action. This construction applied to A, which is regarded naturally as an (A,A)-biGalois object, produces the quantum-commutative quantum-symmetric algebra in [formula] given by the last proposition.

However, we have a natural equivalence [formula] of braided tensor categories (see [\cite=Masuoka08], for example), under which A and B correspond to each other, so that the associated braided tensor functors FA, FB are identified via the equivalence. Therefore, we may restrict ourselves to Hopf algebras, without working with biGalois objects.

Invariants derived from unimodular Hopf algebras

Let A be a finite-dimensional unimodular Hopf algebra, and choose 0  ≠  λ∈Il(A*). By Proposition [\ref=prop:Hopf-alg-as-q-sym-alg], A turns into a quantum-commutative quantum-symmetric algebra A in [formula]. By Corollary [\ref=cor:invariant] this A gives an invariant FA(H) for handlebody-links H, which has values in k since the endomorphism ring [formula] in [formula] coincides with k. The invariant FA(H) depends on choice of λ, but we will not indicate it within the notation except in the following.

Let us write here FA,λ(H) for FA(H), indicating λ. Let 0  ≠  c∈k. If we replace λ with cλ, then [formula] (resp., [formula]) is replaced by its scalar multiple by c (resp., by c- 1). Therefore, we have

[formula]

where [formula], [formula] respectively denote the numbers of [formula], [formula] in H.

Here is the simplest example of computations.

Let O be the trivial genus 1 handlebody-knot, which is represented by the trivial knot. Then,

[formula]

the trace of the linear endomorphism [formula] of A. In particular, [formula], if S is an involution, that is, [formula]. To prove the formula above, we use the expression of Uλ given by Lemma [\ref=lem:Ulambda] (1). Then it follows by Eq. (3) of [\cite=LarsonRadford87] that

[formula]

We should carefully choose A for the invariant, as is seen from the following proposition, whose proof will be postponed for a moment.

If A is not cosemisimple, then FA(H) = 0 for any handlebody-link H.

We say that a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra A is cosemisimple if A* is semisimple as an algebra. We recall the following fundamental results on (co)semisimplicity; see [\cite=Sweedler69] for (1), [\cite=LarsonRadford87], [\cite=LarsonRadford88] for (2), and [\cite=EtingofGelaki98] for (3).

Let A be a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra.

(Sweedler) The following are equivalent:

A is cosemisimple;

There exists a left or right integral λ in A* such that λ(1) = 1;

There exists a left and right integral λ in A* such that λ(1) = 1.

In particular, if A is cosemisimple, then A* is unimodular.

(Larson-Radford) Assume [formula]. Then the following are equivalent:

A is cosemisimple;

A is semisimple;

The antipode S is an involution.

(Etingof-Gelaki) Assume [formula]. Then the following are equivalent:

A is semisimple and cosemisimple;

S is an involution, and [formula] does not divide dim A.

We remark that λ such as in (b), (c) of Part 1 above is unique. As the dual result of Part 1, a finite-dimensional semisimple Hopf algebra is unimodular. It follows from Part 2 that if [formula], then a finite-dimensional cosemisimple Hopf algebra is necessarily unimodular. Whether the same statement holds true in positive characteristic seems an open problem.

Our proof of Proposition [\ref=prop:zero-invariant] is based on the following fact.

Let A be a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra. The vector space [formula] of all morphisms [formula] in [formula] is isomorphic, via φ  ↦  φ(1), to the sub-vector space k1 in A.

Note that given an object V in [formula], the vector space [formula] of all morphisms φ:k  →  V is isomorphic, via φ  ↦  φ(1), to the sub-vector space of V which consists of the elements v such that

[formula]

Suppose V = A. Then the second condition of [\eqref=eq:invariant] is equivalent to v∈k1, which implies the first condition. This proves the lemma.

For the following proof and for later use, let H be a handlebody-link. Choose arbitrarily one from the top handlebody-tangles [formula] in H, and replace it by [formula]. Let [formula] denote the resulting handlebody-tangle; see Figure [\ref=fig:(1] [\ref=0)-tangle]. We thus have [formula], [formula]. We call [formula] a handlebody-tangle horned to H; this varies according to choice of the top [formula].

Let H, [formula] be as above. Lemma [\ref=lem:ktoA] shows that [formula] has values in k1 (⊂  A). Since Il(A*) is spanned by λ, Theorem [\ref=thm:cosemisimple] (1) shows that the non-cosemisimplicity assumption is equivalent to the condition that λ vanishes on k1, which implies that [formula], since [formula] by [\eqref=eq:ev].

By modifying FA(H), we wish to obtain some meaningful invariant of handlebody-links H, when A is not necessarily cosemisimple. Let A be a finite-dimensional unimodular Hopf algebra, and choose 0  ≠  λ∈Il(A*). Let Z(A) denote the center of A. Assume that

[formula]

This assumption is independent of choice of λ, and is satisfied if A* is unimodular, since then [formula], as is seen from Proposition [\ref=prop:integral-integral]. In particular, it is satisfied if A is cosemisimple; see Theorem [\ref=thm:cosemisimple] (1). There are known examples of finite-dimensional cocommutative Hopf algebras which are not unimodular; see [\cite=Montgomery93], for example. Their dual Hopf algebras are examples of finite-dimensional unimodular Hopf algebras which do not satisfy [\eqref=eq:assumption].

Let A, λ be as above. For a handlebody-link H, we define a scalar vA(H) in k by

[formula]

where [formula] is a handlebody-tangle horned to H. Notice from Lemma [\ref=lem:ktoA] that [formula] in k.

We have to show that the value [formula] is independent of choice of the top [formula] to be replaced by [formula]. This will be proved below Lemma [\ref=lem:double-horns].

Suppose that A is cosemisimple. Then by Theorem [\ref=thm:cosemisimple] (1), λ can be chosen so that λ(1) = 1. In this case we have vA(H)  =  FA(H) for every handlebody-link H, since

[formula]

If A is not cosemisimple, we do not have any canonical choice of λ as above. We see from Remark [\ref=rem:choice-of-lambda] that if λ is replaced by cλ with 0  ≠  c∈k, then vA(H) changes by the scalar multiple by [formula].

Let A be a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra. Then the vector space [formula] of all morphisms [formula] in [formula], where [formula] is the tensor product of two copies of [formula], is isomorphic, via φ  ↦  φ(1), to the sub-vector space of [formula] consisting of the elements [formula], where z is an arbitrary element in the center Z(A) of A.

Set [formula]. Give to the same vector space [formula], an alternative structure of a Yetter-Derinfeld module by defining

[formula]

where a∈A, [formula]. Let V' denote the thus defined object. We see that [formula] gives an isomorphism [formula] in [formula], whose inverse is given by [formula]. As is easily seen, the elements [formula], z∈Z(A) are precisely those elements in V' which satisfies the conditions [\eqref=eq:invariant]. It follows that the elements [formula], z∈Z(A) are precisely those which satisfies the same conditions. The proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:ktoA] shows the desired result.

For the rest of this section, let A be a finite-dimensional unimodular Hopf algebra, and choose 0  ≠  λ∈Il(A*) (so that λ(1) = 1 if A is cosemisimple).

Assume [\eqref=eq:assumption]. For any handlebody-tangle T such that s(T) = 0, b(T) = 2, we have

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=lem:ktoAA], for a morphism [formula] in [formula], we have [formula] for some z∈Z(A). The desired result will follow if we see that λ(S(z(1)))z(2) = S(z(1))λ(z(2)), or equivalently,

[formula]

Since λ∈Il(A*) and [formula], we see that the assumption [\eqref=eq:assumption] ensures this last desired condition.

The desired independency of the value vA(H) follows since Lemmas [\ref=lem:ktoA] and [\ref=lem:double-horns] show

The same idea as proving Lemma [\ref=lem:double-horns] shows the following as well.

Assume [\eqref=eq:assumption]. Given two handlebody-links Hi (  ⊂  Bi), i = 1,2, contained in disjoint balls Bi, let H1  #  H2 denote the handlebody-link obtained by attaching them by a 1-handle. Then we have

[formula]

For i = 1,2, let [formula] be a handlebody-tangle horned to Hi. Then [formula]. Since ε:A  →  k is an algebra map, we have

[formula]

Given a handlebody-link (or more generally, a handlebody-tangle) H, let H* denote its mirror image. Let us evaluate vA(H*). Let Aop denote the Hopf algebra A with the opposite product; it has S- 1 as its antipode. We can and we do choose the same λ as the original one as a non-zero left integral in (Aop)*.

For a handlebody-link H, we have

[formula]

We prove this in a generalized situation. Let [formula], τ1(a) = aop denote the canonical linear isomorphism, so that aopbop = (ba)op, where a,b∈A. Let τ0:k  →  k be the identity map. For n > 1, let [formula] be the linear isomorphism defined by

[formula]

Let T be a handlebody-tangle such that s(T) = m, b(T) = n. Then we have

[formula]

By Proposition [\ref=prop:new-relations], we may suppose that T is one of the five tangles listed there.

Suppose T = X. Then [formula]. An element [formula] in [formula] is sent by [formula] to [formula], while it is sent by [formula] to [formula]. Obviously, the two results coincide.

Suppose [formula]. Then [formula]. If (αi), (βi) are the dual bases with respect to 〈 ~ , ~ 〉λ:A  ×  A  →  k, that is, λ(αiβj) = δij, then (βopi), (αopi) are the dual bases with respect to 〈 ~ , ~ 〉λ:Aop  ×  Aop  →  k. This implies that [formula].

Similarly, the desired results follow in the remaining three cases.

Since [formula], Proposition [\ref=prop:mirror-image-knot] follows from Proposition [\ref=prop:mirror-image-tangle] in the special situation when m = 0,n = 1.

First examples of unimodular Hopf algebras

We raise below three examples of finite-dimensional unimodular Hopf algebras A, giving their data needed to compute the invariants vA(H). The duals A* are all unimodular, and the antipodes S of A are involutions. It follows by Theorem [\ref=thm:cosemisimple] that if [formula], then A is semisimple and cosemisimple. We choose two-sided integrals λ in A* and Λ in A such that λ(Λ) = 1.

Let A = kG be the group algebra, where G is a finite group. The Hopf algebra structure is given by

[formula]

where g∈G. We have

[formula]

[formula]

where g,h∈G.

Note λ(1) = 1 and that this A is cosemisimple. By Maschke's Theorem, A is semisimple if and only if [formula] does not divide the order |G| of G.

We remark that if [formula], then the invariant vA(H) coincides with the number of the homomorphisms from the fundamental group of the exterior of a handlebody-knot H to the group G. For, when we regard the value of the invariant as a state sum, each state corresponds to the G-coloring of the diagram.

Let A = D(kG) be the quantum double of kG, where G is a finite group. Note that the dual Hopf algebra (kG)* of kG is spanned by those orthogonal idempotents eg, g∈G, which are defined by eg(h) = δg,h, where g,h∈G. As a coalgebra, [formula], and so

[formula]

where a,g∈G. The product and the antipode on A are given by

[formula]

[formula]

where a,b,g,h∈G. The unit equals [formula]. The remaining data are given by

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Note λ(1) = |G|1. This A is semisimple if and only if it is cosemisimple if and only if [formula]. If these equivalent conditions hold, we should replace the integrals λ, Λ above with |G|- 1λ, |G|Λ, respectively.

Assume that the characteristic [formula] of k is not 2. Fix an integer m > 2. Let A = B4m be the Hopf algebra as defined by [\cite=Masuoka00]. As an algebra this is generated by three elements, a,t,z, and is defined by the relations

[formula]

Here we have re-chosen the generators [formula] given in [\cite=Masuoka00] so that t = s+, z = s+s-, as in [\cite=Masuoka00]. Note z- 1 = azm - 1. Set e0 = (1 / 2)(1 + a), e1 = (1 / 2)(1 - a); these are central idempotents in A such that e0e1 = 0, e0 + e1 = 1. The structure on A is given by

[formula]

This A has (aitjzk)0  ≤  i,j < 2,0  ≤  k < m as a basis, so that dim A = 4m. Note that (eitjzk)0  ≤  i,j < 2,0  ≤  k < m is another basis of A. Let 0  ≤  i,j,p,q < 2, 0  ≤  k,r < m. Set

[formula]

Then we have

[formula]

Note that if q = 0 in particular, then

[formula]

The remaining data are given by

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

It is easy to represent these data with respect to the other basis (eitjzk)0  ≤  i,j < 2,0  ≤  k < m.

Note λ(1) = 1, and that this A is cosemisimple. It is known that A is semisimple if and only if [formula]. Moreover, if k contains a primitive 4m-th root of 1, then A is selfdual, that is, A≃A* as Hopf algebras.

Table [\ref=tab:Kac] lists the invariant vA(H) for the handlebody-knots [formula] in the table given in [\cite=IshiiKishimotoMoriuchiSuzuki12] when [formula].

The invariants derived from the finite quantum group [formula]

Recall from [\cite=Kassel95] the finite quantum group [formula] associated to sl2. Let [formula] be a root of 1, and let e (> 1) denote the order of q2. As an algebra, [formula] is generated by K, E and F, and is defined by the relations

[formula]

This [formula] is a Hopf algebra with respect to the structure

[formula]

To apply results of Radford [\cite=Radford94b], it is convenient to replace the generators above with

[formula]

Then the defining relations turn into

[formula]

We have

[formula]

The Hopf algebra [formula] thus presented coincides with Radford's U(N,ν,ω) in the special situation when N = e, ν = 1 and ω = q2; see [\cite=Radford94b]. We remark that the q in [\cite=Radford94b] should read our q2. The first three parts of the following proposition are proved in Propositions 10, 11 of [\cite=Radford94b].

(aixjyk)0  ≤  i,j,k < e is a basis of [formula], so that [formula].

[formula] is unimodular, and

[formula]

is a non-zero two-sided integral in [formula].

The elements λ, λ' of [formula] defined by

[formula]

where 0  ≤  i,j,k < e, are the left and the right integrals, respectively, in [formula] such that λ(Λ) = 1 = λ'(Λ). It follows that [formula] is not cosemisimple.

[formula] satisfies the assumption of Lemma [\ref=lem:double-horns].

Let us prove Part 4. Since λ(Λ) = λ'(Λ) by Part 3, we see from Proposition [\ref=prop:integral-integral] that [formula]. Let z∈Z(A). Since z commutes with a, we have [formula] with cij∈k. To prove λ(z) = λ'(z), we wish to show that c0,e - 1 = c2,e - 1. The formula given in [\cite=Radford94b] tells us that for each 0 < j < e,

[formula]

where [formula]. This implies that the term a2xe - 2ye - 1 in yz arises from the product of y with the terms a2xe - 2ye - 2, xe - 1ye - 1, a2xe - 1ye - 1 in z. It follows that the coefficient of a2xe - 2ye - 1 in yz equals

[formula]

while the same coefficient in zy equals c2,e - 2. This proves c0,e - 1 = c2,e - 1, as desired.

In what follows we suppose that the base field k is the field [formula] of complex numbers. Hence, q- 1 equals the complex conjugate [formula] of q. We re-choose Λ, λ given in Proposition [\ref=prop:Uq] (2), (3) so that the derived invariants behave preferably with mirror images. For q as above, we define complex numbers cq, εq by

[formula]

Note that εq = 1 if the order [formula] of q is odd, and εq =  - 1 if [formula] is even, and so that [formula]. We define

[formula]

One sees that Λq is a two-sided integral in [formula], and [formula] with λq(Λq) = 1.

We have

[formula]

This follows since one computes

[formula]

K  ↦  Kop, E  ↦  Eop and F  ↦  Fop give a Hopf algebra isomorphism [formula], under which [formula].

It is well-known that the correspondences above gives a Hopf algebra isomorphism. To see that [formula], it suffices to prove that

[formula]

in [formula], since [formula]. By [\eqref=eq:yx] for j = e - 1, we see

[formula]

By multiplying a- (e - 1) = a from the right, it follows that

[formula]

which implies the desired equality.

By Proposition [\ref=prop:Uq] (4), [formula] together with λq defines the invariant [formula] for each handlebody-knot H. Let us write simply vq(H) for this.

Given a handlebody-knot H, the invariant vq(H*) of the mirror image H* of H equals the complex conjugate [formula] of vq(H), that is, [formula].

By Proposition [\ref=prop:integral-integral], the composite of the isomorphism in Lemma [\ref=lem:Uq-isom] with λq coincides with [formula]. Then Proposition [\ref=prop:mirror-image-knot] shows [formula]. It remains to prove [formula]. This equality holds since the Hopf algebra [formula] and the linear map [formula] are the base extensions of [formula], λq, respectively, along the complex conjugation [formula].

Let [formula]. For [formula] we have checked by computer calculation that the invariant does not detect the handlebody-knots [formula] given in [\cite=IshiiKishimotoMoriuchiSuzuki12]. For n > 4 the calculation takes so far too long time for us to see whether the invariant is non-trivial.
