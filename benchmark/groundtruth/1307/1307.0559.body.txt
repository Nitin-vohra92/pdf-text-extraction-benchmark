Introduction

Let X be a compact metric space and T:X  →  X an expanding map. This means that T is Lipschitz continuous and there are numbers [formula], 0 < λ < 1 such that for every point x∈X there is a neighborhood Ux of x in X and continuous branches Si, [formula] of the inverse of T with disjoint images Si(Ux), such that [formula], [formula] [formula], and

[formula]

Given a continuous function [formula], a maximizing measure is a T-invariant Borel probability measure μ which maximizes the integral of F among all T-invariant Borel probabilities:

[formula]

where

[formula]

Recall that an equilibrium state for F is an invariant Borel probability μF which satisfies

[formula]

Ground states are the zero temperature limits of equilibrium states. This means limits of the form [formula]. Here β is interpreted as the inverse of the temperature. It is known [\cite=CLT] that if the limit of a sequence {μβkF}k with βk  →    ∞   exists, then it has to be a maximizing measure with maximal entropy among the maximizing measures. Brémont [\cite=Bre1] proves that the limit [formula] exists if F is locally constant. Chazottes, Gambaudo and Ugalde [\cite=CGU] give a characterization of the limit and a new proof of Brémont's result. Leplaideur [\cite=Lep] gives another proof of Brémont's theorem and a generalization: if G is Hölder continuous and F is locally constant, then the limit when β  →    ∞   of the equilibrium states of G + β  F exists. Chazottes and Hochman [\cite=ChHo] give an example of a Lipschitz function F for which the zero temperature limit does not exist. An example with a discontinuous function was given before by Van Enter and Ruszel [\cite=vER].

For generic Hölder or Lipschitz functions F, the maximizing measure is unique. This is proven in Contreras, Lopes, Thieullen [\cite=CLT] and it is presented in a general version in Jenkinson [\cite=ErgOpt]. The ideas came from an analogous result for lagrangian systems by Mañé [\cite=Ma6]. After Jenkinson lecture notes [\cite=ErgOpt] the study of maximizing measures for a fixed dynamical system became known as Ergodic Optimization. Surveys of the subject are presented by Jenkinson [\cite=ErgOpt] and Baraviera, Leplaideur, Lopes [\cite=BLL].

Let T:X  →  X be a continuous map of a compact metric space. Let E be a topological vector space which is densely and continuously embedded in [formula]. Write

[formula]

Then U(E) is a countable intersection of open and dense sets.

If moreover E is a Baire space, then U(E) is dense in E.

The main conjecture in Ergodic Optimization during the last decade have been wether the maximizing measure for generic Hölder or Lipschitz functions F is supported on a periodic orbit. For lagrangian systems an analogous statement is known as Mañé's conjecture.

On the space [formula] of Lipschitz functions on X we use the norm

[formula]

We denote the the first term in [\eqref=lipnorm] as [formula] and the second term as [formula].

Here we prove

On the negative side, for expanding transformations Bousch [\cite=Bou1] proves that for generic continuous functions the maximizing measure is not supported on a periodic orbit. Indeed, its support is the total space [\cite=Bou1]. Bousch theorem in he case of hyperbolic sets is presented by Jenkinson in [\cite=ErgOpt].

There have been several approaches to the conjecture from which we will use some of their techniques. Write

[formula]

Contreras, Lopes, Thieullen [\cite=CLT] prove that P(E) is open for [formula] the space of α-Hölder continuous functions and in the α-Hölder topology it is open and dense in [formula], the space of functions [formula] such that

[formula]

The main technique is the introduction of a sub-action [formula] to transform the function F to a cohomologous function [formula] such that [formula], where μG is a maximizing measure for G and F. The sub-action is defined similarly, and plays the same role, as a sub-solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for Lagrangian systems. In fact analogous constructions to the weak KAM theory can be translated to this setting. In proposition [\ref=wK] we construct a sub-action following the original method by Fathi [\cite=Fa1] to construct weak KAM solutions. This method was used in ergodic optimization by Bousch in [\cite=BouschP]. In fact many results from Lagrangians systems can be translated to the ergodic optimization setting, see for example Garibaldi, Lopes, Thieullen [\cite=GLT].

Bousch proves that P(E) is dense for Walters functions. Yuan and Hunt [\cite=YH] prove that if a fixed measure is maximizing for an open set of functions F in the Lipschitz topology, then it is supported on a periodic orbit. Their method of perturbation is the basis of the present work. Quas and Siefken [\cite=QS] work in a one-sided shift. They prove that P(E) contains an open and dense set if E is the space of super-continuous functions. They present an elegant version of the method of Yuan and Hunt. We need to modify it for Lipschitz functions and pseudo-orbits with finitely many jumps in Proposition [\ref=perturb].

Another ingredient of the proof is the following theorem. As a weak version of the conjecture, Morris [\cite=Morris] proves

Let X be a compact metric space and [formula] an expanding map. There is a residual set [formula] such that if F∈G then there is a unique F-maximizing measure and it has zero metric entropy.

The idea of the proof of Theorem [\ref=Tmorris] is to use a periodic orbit with small action and small period constructed by Bressaud and Quas [\cite=BQ] and perturb F so that the new minimizing measures are nearby the periodic orbit and hence have small entropy.

The original version of Theorem [\ref=Tmorris] is for Hölder functions in a shift of finite type. In appendix [\ref=aze] we describe the modifications from the proof in Morris [\cite=Morris] needed to obtain Theorem [\ref=Tmorris].

In section [\ref=S1] we develop the techniques from ergodic optimization that we need and present the main perturbation result in proposition [\ref=perturb]. In section [\ref=S2] we prove Theorem [\ref=ThmA] with an argument by contradiction. We show that if the conditions for a perturbation as in proposition [\ref=perturb] do not hold then the entropy must be positive, contradicting Morris Theorem [\ref=Tmorris].

Preliminars

Since X is compact there is a finite subcover of {Ux}x∈X in the definition of expanding transformation. Also there is e0 > 0 such that for every x∈X there is some Uy such that the ball B(x,e0)  ⊂  Uy.

We have that e0 > 0 and 0 < λ < 1 are such that for every x∈X the branches of the inverse of T are well defined, injective, have disjoint images and are λ-contractions on the ball B(x,e0) of radius e0 centered at x.

Given [formula], the Lax operator for F is [formula]

[formula]

where

[formula]

Denote the set of maximizing measures by

[formula]

A calibrated sub-action for F is a fixed point of the Lax operator LF.

If [formula], the Lipschitz constants satisfy

[formula]

In particular [formula].

If LF(u) = u, writing

[formula]

we have that

[formula].

[formula].

[formula]

If [formula] and [formula] satisfy LF(u) = u + β, then β = 0.

Given x,y∈X with d(x,y) < e0, let [formula] be such that

[formula]

Let S:B(y,e0)  →  X be the branch of the inverse of T such that [formula]. We have that

[formula]

The other inequality is similar.

Observe that for any invariant probability μ we have that

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

This gives (i).

(ii). Since LF(u) = u, we have that

[formula]

Thus [formula].

(iii). By the equality [\eqref=oF] we have that [formula]. Since T is continuous, under the weak* topology, the space M(T) of invariant measures is closed in the space of Borel probabilities in X, which is compact. Since [formula] is continuous, the map [formula] is continuous. Therefore the maximum in (i) is attained by an invariant probability.

By (ii) the function [formula] is non-positive. Therefore any invariant measure supported on

[formula]

.

Define [formula] by [\eqref=ovF]. The hypothesis LF(u) = u + β implies that [formula] for all y∈X. Therefore

[formula]

The set

[formula]

f   dμ := 1N f(x),   f∈ C(X, R).

[formula]

and it is T-invariant. We have that

[formula]

For [formula] continuous, write

[formula]

There exists a Lipschitz calibrated sub-action.

By [\eqref=LFu], the Lax operator LF leaves invariant the space

[formula]

Fix x0∈X. Arzelà-Ascoli Theorem implies that the quotient space [formula] with the supremum norm [formula] is compact.

If [formula] then LF(u + a) = LF(u) + a. Therefore [formula] is well defined. If [formula], x∈X and x*u∈X is such that L(u)  =  α + F(x*u) + u(x*u), then

[formula]

Choosing representatives for [formula] and [formula] such that u(x0) = v(x0), we have that [formula]. Thus

[formula]

Therefore the space [formula] is compact and convex and on it LF is continuous. By Schauder Theorem [\cite=GK] LF has a fixed point in [formula]. In fact LF is non-expanding in the supremum norm and a simpler fixed point applies [\cite=GK].

Then there is [formula] and [formula] such that LF(u) = u + β. By Lemma [\ref=LoF]-3, we have that β = 0.

If u is a calibrated sub-action, every point z∈X has a calibrating pre-orbit, (zk)k  ≤  0 such that T(z- k) = z- k + 1, Ti(z- i) = z0 = z and

[formula]

Or equivalently, since T(zk) = zk + 1,

[formula]

The iteration of equality [\eqref=cal] gives

[formula]

for any calibrating pre-orbit.

If there is a periodic orbit O(y) such that for any calibrated sub-action the α-limit of every calibrating pre-orbit is O(y) then every maximizing measure has support on O(y).

It is enough to prove the following

If ν is an ergodic maximizing measure there is a Borel set Y with ν(Y) = 1 such that for any y∈Y there is a calibrating pre-orbit [formula] of a calibrated sub-action u such that y∈α-lim[formula].

We will prove it by applying Poincaré Recurrence Theorem to the inverse of the natural (bijective) extension of T.

There is a canonical way of embedding an expanding map into an invertible map as follows. Let [formula] be the space of sequences [formula] with T(xn + 1) = xn for every [formula], endowed with the subspace topology induced by the product tolopogy on [formula]. Since X is compact, by Tychonof Theorem [formula] is compact and then, as a closed subspace, [formula] is compact. Let [formula] be defined by [formula]. Then [formula] is a homeomorphism with inverse [formula]. We have the semiconjugacy

[formula]

given by [formula]. The projection π0 is continuous and hence Borel measurable. There is a natural way of lifting invariant measures as follows (cf. Bowen [\cite=Bowen0]). If [formula] define [formula] by

[formula]

If μ is a T-invariant Borel probability on X define [formula] on Borel([formula]) by

[formula]

Then [formula] is [formula]-invariant and (π0)*() = μ.

Suppose that ν is an ergodic maximizing measure for [formula] and let [formula] be its invariant lift to [formula] as defined above. The measure [formula] is [formula]-invariant and thus also [formula]-invariant. Then [formula] is [formula]-invariant. Let [formula] be the set of [formula]-recurrent points in [formula] and [formula]. Then [formula]. If y∈Y then there is [formula] such that [formula] is [formula]-recurrent, i.e. [formula]. We have that [formula] is a pre-orbit of T in [formula] with y0 = y and [formula].

Let u be any calibrated sub-action. Let [formula] be defined by [\eqref=ovF]. By Lemma [\ref=LoF]-2.(iii) we have that [formula]. Thus by the remark in [\eqref=cal2] the pre-orbit [formula] calibrates u.

We say that a sequence [formula] is a δ-pseudo-orbit if d(xn + 1,T(xn))  ≤  δ, [formula].

We say that the orbit of y ε-shadows a pseudo-orbit [formula] if [formula], d(Tn(y),xn) < ε.

If [formula] is a δ-pseudo-orbit with δ < (1 - λ)e0 then there is y∈X whose orbit ε-shadows [formula] with [formula]. If [formula] is a periodic pseudo-orbit then y is a periodic orbit with the same period.

Write B(x,r): = {  z∈X  |  d(z,x)  ≤  r  } and [formula]. Let Sk be the branch of the inverse of T such that Sk(T(xk)) = xk. Since a + δ  <  e0, we have that

[formula]

Let y∈X be given by

[formula]

The point y exists and is unique because it is the intersection of a nested family of non-empty compact sets with diameter smaller than 2aλk. We have that Tk(y)∈B(xk,a). Thus y a-shadows (xk). Now suppose (xk) is p-periodic. Then also Tp(y) a-shadows (xk). The uniqueness of y implies that Tp(y) = y.

If Tp(y) = y and (zk)k  ≤  0 is a pre-orbit which (1 - λ)e0-shadows the orbit O(y) of y, i.e. [formula], T(zk) = zk + 1 and d(zk,Tk    mod  p(y)) < (1 - λ)e0, then the α-limit of (zk) is O(y).

Let [formula]. Then there is a sequence kn  →    -    ∞   such that lim nzkn = w. Extracting a subsequence if necessary, we may assume that [formula] is constant. Then there is [formula] such that [formula] for all n. The argument in Proposition [\ref=shadowing] shows that [formula]. Therefore [formula]. It follows that [formula].

We show now a condition which allows to obtain a perturbation with maximizing measure supported on a periodic orbit. The argument appeared first in Yuan and Hunt [\cite=YH]. The proof below is a modification that we shall need of the arguments by Quas and Siefken [\cite=QS] which we adapt to pseudo-orbits.

Let [formula] be a periodic point for T. Let Py be the set of Lipschitz functions [formula] such that there is a unique F-maximizing measure and it is supported on the positive orbit of y. Let Uy be the interior of Py in [formula].

Let [formula] with LF(u) = u and let [formula] be defined by [\eqref=ovF].

Suppose that there exists [formula] such that for every Q > 1 and δ0 > 0 there exist 0 < δ  <  δ0 and a p(δ)-periodic δ-pseudo-orbit [formula] in

[formula]

Observe that fixing [formula], for any [formula] the functions H and [formula] have the same maximizing measures. Therefore it is enough to prove that the function [formula] is in the closure of [formula].

Let ε > 0. We will show a perturbation of F with Lipschitz norm smaller than ε such that it has a unique maximizing measure supported on a periodic orbit. Moreover, we will exhibit a neighborhood of the perturbed function in which the same periodic orbit is the unique maximizing measure for all functions in the neighborhood. The neighborhood will depend on the periodic orbit.

Let

[formula]

Assume that δ, [formula] and [formula] are so small that δ, ρ, γ3 are all positive, smaller than (1 - λ)e0 and that

[formula]

Let y be the p-periodic point which [formula]-shadows (xk). Write yk: = Tk(y) and

[formula]

For a function [formula] write

[formula]

Let ni, [formula], [formula], be the jumps of (xk); i.e. [formula] if [formula]. Using Proposition [\ref=shadowing], we have that

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

By hypothesis [formula], [formula], thus [formula]. Therefore

[formula]

[formula]

Observe that if 0  ≤  i < j < p,

[formula]

Assume that d(z,yk)  ≤  ρ  ≪  e0. Take w1∈T- 1{z} such that d(w1,yk - 1) < λρ. If [formula] then

[formula]

Proof: Let yj∈O(y) be such that d(w2,O(y)) = d(w2,yj).

Let S be the branch of the inverse of T such that S(z) = w1. If x,y∈B(z,e0) then

[formula]

This implies that [formula]. We also get that [formula] and then T is injective in the ball [formula]. In particular [formula].

If j = k  -  1 then

[formula]

If j  ≠  k - 1 then

[formula]

[formula]

This proves the claim.

Now we make two perturbations to [formula]. The first perturbation is the addition of -  εg(x), where

[formula]

This is a perturbation with

[formula]

The second is a perturbation by any function with

[formula]

This perturbation depends on O(y), and in particular on its period p. We shall prove that the function [formula] has a unique maximizing measure supported on the periodic orbit O(y). Since the set of such functions G1 contains an open ball centered at [formula], this proves the proposition.

Let

[formula]

where

[formula]

It is enough to prove the claim for G because G and G1 have the same maximizing measures.

Using [\eqref=AF], we have that

[formula]

Let v be a calibrated sub-action for G, LG(v) = v. Given any z∈X let (zk)k  ≤  0 be a pre-orbit of z which calibrates v. Let [formula] be the times on which d(zk,O(y)) > ρ. If tn + 1 < tn - 1 there is [formula] such that the orbit segment (zk)tn - 1k = tn + 1 + 1 ρ-shadows (y- i + sn)1i = tn - tn + 1 - 1, thus

[formula]

By the Claim, we have that

[formula]

Since both terms in [formula] are non-positive, from [\eqref=G] and [\eqref=beta] we obtain

[formula]

On a shadowing segment we have

[formula]

Write

[formula]

with 0  ≤  r < p and separate the shadowing segment in m loops along the orbit O(y) and a residue with at most p - 1 iterates. Using [\eqref=hb] for (p - 1) times and [\eqref=shadowbound], we have that

[formula]

By the definition of β we have that 〈G〉(y)  ≤  0. Therefore

[formula]

On the points ztn we have that d(ztn,O(y)) > ρ. Using [\eqref=G], [\eqref=hb], [\eqref=h0] and [\eqref=defb],

[formula]

In particular, this holds when tn = tn - 1 - 1.

When tn + 1 < tn - 1, using [\eqref=G], [\eqref=tg3] and [\eqref=hb], we have that

[formula]

Thus, adding [\eqref=SG] and [\eqref=Gzt], and using [\eqref=h0] and [\eqref=defa],

[formula]

From [\eqref=defbeta] we have that α(G) = 0. Since by definition (zk)k  ≤  0 is a calibrating pre-orbit for v, as in [\eqref=sumcal], we have that for all k < 0,

[formula]

Since v is finite, we get that

[formula]

From [\eqref=Gzt1] and [\eqref=Gtn] we obtain that the sequence tn is finite. Since ρ < (1 - λ)e0, from Corollary [\ref=expansivity] we get that every calibrating pre-orbit has α-limit O(y). By Lemma [\ref=rp], this implies that every maximizing measure for G has support on O(y).

Proof of Theorem [\ref=ThmA]

Proof of theorem [\ref=ThmA]:

We prove that [formula] is open and dense. It is clearly open.

Suppose, by contradiction, that there is a non-empty open set

[formula]

which is disjoint from [formula]. By Theorem [\ref=Tmorris] and Remark [\ref=mergodic] we can choose F∈W such that it has an ergodic maximizing measure μ with entropy

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=LoF]-2.(iii) for any calibrating subaction u for F, we have that [formula], where [formula] is from [\eqref=ovF]. Let [formula] be a generic point for μ, i.e. for any continuous function [formula],

[formula]

Since F is not in the closure of [formula], by Proposition [\ref=perturb] with M = 2, we have the following

Let N0 be such that

[formula]

Fix a point [formula] for which Brin-Katok Theorem holds [\cite=BK], i.e.

[formula]

where V(w,L,ε) is the dynamic ball:

[formula]

Given N > N0 let [formula] be all the [formula] returns to w, i.e.

[formula]

We need the following

For any [formula],   [formula]

Using Proposition [\ref=expo] we continue the proof of Theorem A.

Write

[formula]

Given N  ≫  N0, let [formula] be a continuous function such that 0  ≤  f  ≤  1, [formula] and [formula]. Using that q is a generic point for μ and Proposition [\ref=expo], we have that

[formula]

Recall that the dynamic ball about w is

[formula]

We have that

[formula]

where Sk is the branch of the inverse of T such that Sk(Tkw) = Tk - 1w. Therefore

[formula]

Let N be such that

[formula]

Then

[formula]

Using [\eqref=muB], we have that

[formula]

[formula]

By Brin-Katok Theorem [\cite=BK] and the choice of w in [\eqref=wBK], we have that This contradicts the choice of F and μ in [\eqref=0ent]. Therefore such non-empty open set W in [\eqref=cU] does not exist. This implies that the (open) set [formula] is dense.

Now we prove

For any [formula],   [formula]

Proof: For [formula], let

[formula]

From [\eqref=N0] and Statement [\ref=STM], we get

Write qi: = Ti(q). From [\eqref=Nreturns], the sequence [formula] is a periodic Q- N pseudo-orbit in O(q) with 1 jump. Therefore there is a Q- N + 1-return [formula] with [formula] and [formula]. This gives rise to two Q- N + 1 periodic pseudo-orbits in O(q) with at most 2 jumps. Namely, [formula] and [formula]. Each of them give rise to a Q- N + 2 return... This process will continue as long as N  ≥  N0.

It is simpler to show the inductive process in a picture. Draw a circle [formula] with the elements of the pseudo-orbit [formula]. Inside the disk [formula], draw a line from qi to qj. It may be that [formula] but in that case [formula]. The line [formula] separates the disk in two components. Each component is a Q- N + 1 pseudo-orbit with at most two jumps (one jump of size ≤  Q- N + 1 and possibly another with size ≤  Q- N < Q- N + 1). Thus, each component has at least one Q- N + 2 return [formula] The interior of the lines in this construction do not intersect.

We will also draw a tree with the returns, in order to see that their number grows exponentially. An example appears in figure [\ref=ex1]. The nodes of the tree are the returns implied by Statement [\ref=STM2]. The height of the node bounds the size of the return. The numbers near a node are the quantity of returns in upper levels of the tree which are adjacent to the return of the node, either at its left or at its right. These numbers are also equal to - 1 +the quantity of jumps of the two new periodic pseudo-orbits determined by the node.

We show how the tree is constructed in the example of figure [\ref=ex1]. We begin with a return in [formula]. This gives a periodic Q- N pseudo-orbit with no other jump. It implies the existence of a return in [formula]. In the tree we draw a vertical line from level N to level N - 1. At this stage, the line in the circle corresponding to the [formula] return divides the disk in two components. One side has 1 return in [formula] that appears in a previous level in the tree and the other side has 0 returns appearing above in the tree. We write the numbers 0 and 1 at the sides of the node of the tree corresponding to the [formula] return. The [formula] return divides the circle in two components. The component at the left is a periodic QN - 1 pseudo-orbit with only one QN - 1 jump, corresponding to the number 0 in the tree. The component at the right is a QN - 1 pseudo-orbit with a QN - 1 jump and also a QN jump, and corresponds to the number 1 in the tree in the node at level N - 1.

Statement [\ref=STM2] implies the existence of other returns in [formula] for both pseudo-orbits. In the right hand side of figure [\ref=ex1] we draw the case in which the pseudo-orbit segment between the [formula] return contains a Q- N jump. Cutting the QN - 1 pseudo-orbit of the right hand side of the circle at the [formula] return we obtain two QN - 2 periodic pseudo-orbits. The one at the right has a QN jump which appears previously in the tree and the one at the left has a QN - 1 jump appearing previously in the tree. We write the numbers 1 and 1 in the corresponding node of the tree.

We want to guarantee that each node of the tree corresponds to a return which has at least one new point of the pseudo-orbit [formula] which did not appear in the returns corresponding to the other nodes of the tree. So that we have

[formula]

Given a Q- B periodic pseudo-orbit [formula] with at most M = 2 jumps, from Statement [\ref=STM2] we get a return (i,j) with [formula], a  ≤  i  <  j  ≤  b and (i,j)  ≠  (a,b). Say i = a. We have one return (a,j) and the next return in the construction of the tree would be (j,b). In that case the new node in the tree does not correspond to a new element in the pseudo-orbit, the points qa, qj, qb were already counted. To avoid this situation we observe that [formula] is indeed a Q- B + 1 periodic pseudo-orbit because [formula]. In the disk we draw two new lines [formula] and [formula] and shadow the region bounded by these two lines and [formula]. We treat the region as a new line. That is, the two new components in the [formula] are treated as the two sides of a new line in [formula] corresponding to a node in the tree. The numbers in the node are -1 + the quantity of jumps of each of the pseudo-orbits determined by the components. There is some ambiguity about which side is the left or the right of the shadow. Introducing the shadow forces that the descendant nodes from the shadow contain new points of the orbit segment which have not been accounted for in the upper levels of the tree.

We describe in figures [\ref=emu00] - [\ref=emu02] all the possibilities for a vertical step of size one of the tree's construction. The "bitten" parts are returns which appeared previously in the tree's construction. In the case of a node at level B with numbers (0,2), for M = 2 Statement [\ref=STM2] does not give a new return for the side which already has 2 returns. In this case Statement [\ref=STM2] only implies that there is one return in [formula] in the side which had 0 previous returns. Then for a node at level B with numbers (0,2) we draw only one vertical line to level B - 1, as in figure [\ref=emu02].

The tree is constructed by joining the pieces shown in these figures. Except for the nodes with numbers (0,2) all the other nodes have two child nodes. All the nodes have at least one child. Nodes with numbers (1,2) do not appear in the construction. The nodes with numbers (0,2) in figure [\ref=emu02] have one child with numbers different from (0,2). This implies that they have at least two grandchildren nodes. This is graphically shown in figure [\ref=desc]. Therefore the quantity of nodes at least duplicates in every sequence of two vertical steps. The tree continues growing while the height number is larger than N0. Thus it has at least N - N0 vertical steps and then at least (N - N0 - 1) / 2 sequences of two vertical steps (and hence duplication of nodes). We obtain

[formula]

Zero Entropy.

In this appendix we prove Ian Morris Theorem [\ref=Tmorris]. The published version was written for symbolic dynamics. We need two lemmas.

Let [formula] be non-negative real numbers, and let [formula]. Then

[formula]

where we use the convention 0   log 0  =  0.

Applying Jensen's inequality to the concave function x  ↦   - x log x yields

[formula]

from which the result follows.

Let [formula] and suppose that M max(f) = {μ} for some μ∈M(T). Then there is C > 0 such that for every ν∈M(T),

Since [formula] is continuous, it follows that [formula] for every [formula]. Let [formula]. Given x∈X, let z∈K be such that d(x,z) = d(x,K). We have that

[formula]

from which the result follows.

[\ref=Tmorris]. Theorem {(Morris [\cite=Morris]).

By the linearity of the integral, or by the characterization of maximizing measures in Lemma [\ref=LoF]-2.(iii), the ergodic components of a maximizing measure are also maximizing. Therefore the unique maximizing measure in Theorem [\ref=Tmorris] is ergodic. In fact the map [formula] is uniquely ergodic.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=Tmorris]:

For p  ≥  1 let Mp(T) be the set of invariant probabilities supported on a periodic orbit of period smaller or equal to p. In this appendix we will identify a periodic orbit [formula] with the corresponding invariant measure [formula].

Let

[formula]

be such that for every x∈X the branches of the inverses of T at x are well defined, injective, and are λ-contractions on the ball B(x,ε0) of radius e0 centered at x.

is residual.

It is enough to prove that [formula] is open and dense for every γ > 0, for then the set

satisfies the requirements of the Theorem.

Step 1. [formula] is open.

Suppose that [formula], [formula] and lim nfn  =  f in [formula]. Then there are νn∈M max(fn) with h(νn)  ≥  2γ  htop(T). Taking a subsequence if necessary, we may assume that νn  →  ν∈M(T). For any μ∈M(T) we have that

[formula]

Taking lim n we get that [formula] for any μ∈M(T) and hence ν∈M max(T). Since the map m  ↦  h(m) is upper semicontinuous (see e.g. Walters [\cite=Walters]) we have that h(ν)  ≥  2γ  htop(T). Therefore [formula]. We conclude that [formula] is closed and then [formula] is open.

Step 2. We have to prove that [formula] intersects every non-empty open set. Let [formula] be open and non-empty. By Theorem [\ref=CLT] there is f∈U such that M max(f) has only one element μ. If μ is a periodic orbit then [formula] and we are done. Otherwise, since by Lemma [\ref=LoF]-2.(iii) any measure in [formula] would also be maximizing, we have that [formula] does not contain a periodic orbit. By Lemma [\ref=A.2] there is a real number C > 0 and a compact invariant set K such that for every ν∈M(T)

[formula]

and such that K does not contain a periodic orbit.

Let β > 0 be small enough that f + g∈U whenever

[formula]

We will construct a sequence of approximating functions such that [formula] for n large enough. In the next two steps we choose a sequence of periodic orbits which will be used in the construction.

Step 3.

Given any 0 < θ < 1, there is a sequence of integers (mn)n and a sequence of periodic orbits μn∈Mn(T) such that

Proof of the Claim. By a theorem of Bressaud and Quas [\cite=BQ] for every k > 0

[formula]

Indeed recall that using a Markov partition (cf. Ruelle [\cite=ruelle]) the map T is Hölder continuously semi-conjugate to a subshift of finite type. This is enough to obtain estimate [\eqref=eBQ] (see the proof of Corollary 3 in Bressaud and Quas [\cite=BQ]).

From [\eqref=eBQ] there exists a sequence of periodic orbits μn∈Mn(T) such that

[formula]

Define

[formula]

Since

[formula]

we have that r- 1n log θn  →  0. Define [formula], then m- 1n log θn  →  0 and

[formula]

as required.

Step 4. Using [\eqref=e0] fix

[formula]

Choose mn and μn as in Claim [\ref=CTM]. Define [formula].

There is [formula] such that when [formula]

[formula]

for every invariant measure ν∈M(T) such that h(ν)  ≥  2γ  htop(T).

Proof of the Claim.

Recall that a Markov partition for T is a finite collection of sets Si which cover X such that

[formula].

If i  ≠  j then [formula].

f(Si) is a union of sets Sj.

Ruelle [\cite=ruelle] proves that for expanding maps there are Markov partitions of arbitrarily small diameter. Let [formula] be a Markov partition with [formula]. The elements of the partition

[formula]

have diameter smaller than λn - 1e0 and contain an open set. Then the partition [formula] is generating because the σ-algebra

[formula]

contains all the open sets. Therefore (cf. Walters [\cite=Walters]) for every invariant measure ν∈M(T),

[formula]

From the definition of topological entropy using covers (cf. Walters [\cite=Walters]) we have that

[formula]

Choose [formula] large enough such that for all [formula]

Let ν∈M(T) and suppose that

[formula]

for some [formula]. We will show that necessarily h(ν) < 2γ  htop(ν).

Let

[formula]

From [\eqref=lega],

[formula]

Using lemma [\ref=A.1] we have that

[formula]

Let g be a branch of the inverse of Tmn. If x,y are in the domain of g, we have that

[formula]

Using [\eqref=theta], observe that since [formula] for any y∈Ln there is a branch g of the inverse of Tmn such that the ball

[formula]

Since [formula] is a Markov partition with [formula],

[formula]

Therefore the ball B(y,θmn) intersects at most [formula] elements of [formula] because by applying Tmn

[formula]

Since Ln has at most n elements, [formula]. Thus from [\eqref=hnu] and [\eqref=20] we have that

[formula]

This proves the claim.

Step 5. We now complete the proof. Define a sequence of functions [formula] by

[formula]

where [formula] as above. From the definition of β in [\eqref=Ubeta] we have that fn∈U for each n  ≥  1. From Claim [\ref=CTM] in step 3 we have that and from Claim [\ref=CSA4] in step 4 it follows that when n is sufficiently large,

[formula]

for all ν∈M(T) such that h(ν)  ≥  2γ  htop(T).

We may therefore choose n such that [formula] for every ν∈M(T) such that h(ν)  ≥  2γ  htop(T). It follows that for every such measure ν

[formula]

where we have applied [\eqref=Ae3] and [\eqref=fn]. We have shown that if ν∈M(T) and h(ν)  ≥  2γ  htop(T), then ν∉M max(fn), and therefore [formula]. We conclude that [formula] is dense in [formula] and the theorem is proved.
