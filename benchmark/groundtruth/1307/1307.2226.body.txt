Symmetry breaking of extremals for the Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequalities in a non-Hilbertian setting

Introduction

This paper deals with the celebrated Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequalities in [formula], n  ≥  2. Let p,q be given exponents, such that

[formula]

where [formula] if p < n, and p*  =    ∞   if p  ≥  n. For any a > p - n define

[formula]

In [\cite=CKN] and [\cite=Maz] it is proved that there exists a constant c = c(N,p,a,q) > 0 such that

[formula]

for any [formula]. Let

[formula]

Notice that [formula] if p < n and a = 0. The best constant in ([\ref=eq:CKN]) is given by

[formula]

We point out that the minimization problem ([\ref=eq:minimization]) is characterized by a lack of compactness, since the integrals in ([\ref=eq:CKN]) are both invariant with respect to the group of transforms

[formula]

Nevertheless, the infimum Sp(a,q) is always achieved: we quote [\cite=CaWa] for p = 2 (see also [\cite=CaMu99] for a very first result in a special case), and [\cite=Ho], [\cite=GaMu1] in the generality of the above assumptions. The exponent H in ([\ref=eq:dilations]) has a special meaning, as it is related to the Hardy inequality: it is well known that

[formula]

The presence of weights in the integrals in ([\ref=eq:minimization]) affects the property of minimizers to be radially symmetric or not. In this paper we prove the following result.

Assume p < q < p* and let a > p - n be given. If

[formula]

where p' is the conjugate exponent to p, then no minimizer for Sp(a,q) is radial.

As a consequence to Theorem [\ref=T:BS1], we immediately get a multiplicity result for problem

[formula]

If the assumptions in Theorem [\ref=T:BS1] are satisfied, then problem ([\ref=eq:equation]) has at least two distinct nonnegative and nontrivial solutions.

Theorem [\ref=T:BS1] implies in particular that for any fixed p,q, if a is larger than the unique a* > p - n such that

[formula]

then symmetry breaking occurs. The next result better explains this phenomenon from a qualitative point of view (see also Remark [\ref=R:np] for the case n  ≤  p).

Let p,q be given, with n > p and 1 < p < q < p*. There exists an exponent a *   ≥  0 such that

for any a > a *  no extremal for Sp(a,q) is radially symmetric;

for any a  ≤  a *  there exists a radial extremal for Sp(a,q).

By Theorem [\ref=T:BS1] we have that a *   ≤  a*. We conjecture that condition ([\ref=eq:BS]) can not be improved, that is, a *  = a*.

More results are available in the Hibertian case p = 2. Symmetry breaking was already observed by Catrina and Wang in [\cite=CaWa]. Then in [\cite=FeSc] Felli and Schneider gave a sharper description of the region in which symmetry breaking occurs. More precisely, from Corollary 1.2 of [\cite=FeSc] one gets that if

[formula]

then no minimizer for S2(a,q) is radial. Notice that condition ([\ref=eq:BS]) with p = 2 coincides with the Felli-Schneider's one.

As concerns symmetry results, in the recent paper [\cite=DEL] Dolbeault, Esteban and Loss prove that minimizers for S2(a,q) are necessarily radial when

[formula]

In particular, a* > 0 in the Hilbertian case p = 2.

In [\cite=BW] and [\cite=SW] the case p > 1 is considered. The main result in those papers gives symmetry breaking for any a  ≥  a0, with a0 = a0(n,p,q) large enough. However, no explicit estimate for a0 is given there. The proofs in [\cite=BW] and in [\cite=SW] are based on the analysis of the asymptotic behaviour of the best constants Sp(a,q) and Sp,rad(a,q) (on radial functions) as a  →    ∞  .

Our proof relies on the explicit knowledge of radial solutions to ([\ref=eq:equation]) and is developed by computing the second variation of the functional defined by the quotient in ([\ref=eq:minimization]), along a suitably chosen direction [formula].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=T:BS1]

It has been recently proved in [\cite=MuAMPA] that, up to change of sign and up to the transform ([\ref=eq:dilations]), problem ([\ref=eq:equation]) has a unique nontrivial radial solution U in [formula]. More precisely, U is given by

[formula]

Since the function U in ([\ref=eq:U_explicit]) solves ([\ref=eq:equation]), then U is a critical point of the functional

[formula]

Theorem [\ref=T:BS1] follows by analyzing the linearized operator around the radial extremal U, to show that if U achieves the best constant Sp(a,q) then ([\ref=eq:BS]) can not hold.

Assume that U is a local minimum for R. Let [formula] be the eigenfunction of the Laplace operator on [formula] relatively to the smaller positive eigenvalue, that is,

[formula]

Fix any nontrivial and radial function [formula]. Clearly, one has that [formula]. Since U achieves the best constant Sp(a,q), then the real function Rv:t  ↦    ~  R(U + tvφ1) has a local minimum at t = 0. Notice that Rv is twice differentiable at 0, as [formula] never vanishes on the support of v (some care is needed if p < 2). Using

[formula]

([\ref=eq:f1]) and Rv''(0)  ≥  0 one gets

[formula]

Our next goal is to take

[formula]

and β to choose in a suitable way. This step can be done by a standard limit argument provided that the exponent β is such that the mappings [formula], [formula], and |x|- baUq - 2|v|2, with v given by ([\ref=eq:v]), are integrable on [formula]. To this purpose we set and we notice that the summability at the origin and at infinity of the functions contained in the above integrals is ensured provided that β satisfies

[formula]

respectively. In this case one has that Setting

[formula]

where [formula] and C is the constant in ([\ref=eq:U_explicit]), and

[formula]

we can write As 0 < s + n < tQH, integration by parts yields that

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

where

[formula]

Using the above computations and notation, from ([\ref=eq:Q'']) we infer that

[formula]

The right hand side in ([\ref=eq:Q''beta]) is a second order polynomial function with respect to β having a minimum at

[formula]

We notice that this value of β satisfies ([\ref=eq:summability]). For such a value of β ([\ref=eq:Q''beta]) becomes Hence if ([\ref=eq:BS]) holds, then the extremal function for Sp(a,q) cannot be radial.

Let us focus our attention on the mapping [formula] used as a test function in the previous proof. When p = 2 this choice of v was already considered in [\cite=FeSc], and in Proposition 8 of [\cite=DELT], to estimate the region of parameters (a,q) for which symmetry breaking occurs. In [\cite=FeSc] and in [\cite=DELT] the expression for v was suggested in a natural way by the explicit knowledge of the solutions of a related eigenvalue problem, according to known results displayed in the book [\cite=LL] by Landau and Lifshitz. In the general case considered here, i.e., when p  ≠  2, to our knowledge this information is missing. We finally point out that the exponent βH in the expression of v is the same appearing in the formula ([\ref=eq:U_explicit]) of the radial ground state U.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=T:2]

We define

[formula]

For a given pair a,a' > p - n we put

[formula]

From the explicit knowledge of the extremals for Sradp(a,q) one infers that

[formula]

Next we put

[formula]

By Theorem [\ref=T:BS1] the set A is not empty. Fix a∈A and take a' > a. We claim that a'∈A. For the proof, let u be an extremal for Sp(a,q). Define t as before, and put

[formula]

We compute, using polar coordinates [formula],

[formula]

as t > 1. Since in addition

[formula]

we infer that

[formula]

Now we recall that u∈A achieves Sp(a,q). Therefore, using also ([\ref=eq:rad]) we conclude that

[formula]

and therefore a'∈A. We have proved that A  ⊇  (a * ,  ∞  ), where a * : =  inf A. Actually, A = (a * ,  ∞  ), thanks to a continuity argument.

To check that a is nonnegative we first notice that Sp(a,q)  ≤  Sradp(a,q) for any a > p - n. If a = 0 the weight |x|- b0 is radially decreasing. Thus Schwarz symmetrization (see [\cite=LiLo]) implies that

[formula]

that is, 0∉A and therefore 0  ≤  a * .

Assume p  ≥  n. The above argument gives the existence of a *   ≥  p - n such that symmetry breaking occurs in (a * ,  ∞  ) and can not occur in (p - n,a * ]. It would be of interest to know if a *  > p - n. A positive answer to this question was given by Dolbeault, Esteban, Loss and Tarantello in the Hilbertian case n = p = 2, see Theorem 2 in [\cite=DET].

Here we assume that 1 < p < n and we take q = p*. From [\cite=CKN] we know that the infimum

[formula]

is positive, provided that a > p - n. Moreover, if in addition a  ≤  0 then Sp(a,p*) is attained (see [\cite=Au], [\cite=Ta] when a = 0 and [\cite=Ho], [\cite=GaMu1] when a∈(p - n,0)). The argument in the proof of Theorem [\ref=T:2] has been already used by Horiuchi in [\cite=Ho] to show that Sp(a,p*) = Sradp(a,p*) for any a  ≤  0.

If a > 0 and p = 2 then S2(a,2*) is not attained (see [\cite=CaWa]) whereas if p  ≠  2, to our knowledge any existence or non existence result of ground state is still missing.
