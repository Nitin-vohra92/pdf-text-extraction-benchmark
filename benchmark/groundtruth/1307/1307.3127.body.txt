Origin of magnetar-scale crustal field in PSR J1852+0040 and "frozen" magnetars

INTRODUCTION

Magnetars are neutron stars (NSs) whose energy budget is dominated by dissipation of electric currents supporting magnetic fields. Known objects of this type have strong fields: poloidal (in particular, dipolar) or/and toroidal. The origin of these strong fields is still not clear.

In their foundational paper [\cite=dt92] proposed that strong fields are enhanced via a dynamo mechanism. This scenario requires rapid initial rotation of a NS. Field of the order of 1015 G can be reached if the initial spin is ~  1 msec. This is a strong prediction that potentially can be tested.

[\cite=vink] studied supernova remnants (SNRs) with magnetars to check if traces of additional energy release due to a rapidly spinning down magnetar can be found. Indeed, a young magnetar is a very powerful source with a luminosity [formula] erg s- 1. Such objects were even considered as central engines of gamma-ray bursts [\citep=usov]. Though, no additional energy input in magnetars' SNRs have been found [\citep=vink]. Still, this result does not exclude the original scenario by [\cite=dt92]. Note also, that alternatives related to fossil fields [\citep=ferrario] have been seriously critisized [\citep=spruit], as just a small fraction of the total stellar magnetic flux can end in a NS.

Unfortunately, due to a rapid spin down and field decay initial periods of magnetars are quickly "forgotten". However, there is a situation, when the initial period can be "frozen". This is related to strong fall-back which results in burying of the magnetic field [\citep=mp95] [\citep=ho11] [\citep=vp12] [\citep=bern12]. Such a NS -- magnetar inside, anti-magnetar outside, -- can be a Rosetta stone for understanding the origin of strong magnetic fields. Potentially, a NS in the SNR Kes 79 could be such an object.

The NS in Kes 79 (PSR J1852+0040) belongs to the class of so-called "anti-magnetars" [\citep=hg10]. It has a spin period p = 0.105 s, [formula], and so the polar magnetic field for an orthogonal rotator is about 6.2  ×  1010 G. The SNR age is estimated as ~  6  ×  103 years. The source has one peculiar feature: large (64%) pulse fraction. [\cite=sl12] show that large pulse fraction of the NS in Kes 79 can be explained if its magnetic field in the crust is very strong: few ×  1014 G. In their study the authors assumed that the strong component of the field is the toroidal one. Potentially, this opens two possibilities. First, despite its young age the NS in Kes 79 is an analogue of so-called low-field magnetars (see a review in [\citealt=turolla]). Second, both components are strong, and they have been significantly submerged due to a strong fall-back episode ([\citealt=gpz99] called such sources "hidden magnetars"). Below we analyse how this can be used to put constraints on the origin of magnetars' magnetic field.

ANALYSIS AND ESTIMATES

The process of fall-back on a newborn magnetar can be a very complicated one. However, in this section we apply simple formulae to perform a qualitative analysis of the consequences of such a process.

At first, we recall that accretion on the surface of a NS can be prohibited either by a relativistic wind (so-called ejector stage), or by a rapidly rotating magnetosphere (propeller stage), see a detailed description of stages, for example, in [\cite=lipunov]. Transition between stages can be formalized in terms of critical spin periods (back transitions can be not symmetric, and so corresponding critical periods can be different, also additional conditions can be important, but we do not discuss here situations not applicable to the fall-back case).

The first one, [formula], corresponds to the transition ejector→  propeller. The second, [formula], -- to the transition propeller→  accretor. We are interested mainly in the latter one, as the fall-back we are interested in, is strong enough to switch off the pulsar.

[formula]

Here μ -- magnetic moment of a NS, M -- its mass, and [formula] -- accretion rate. We use standard accretion formulae for the adiabatic index γ = 5 / 3. [\cite=che89] is his estimates used γ = 4 / 3 (a radiation dominated envelope). However, as can be seen from his eqs. (4.22) and (5.2) for fields of the magnetar scale the magnetosphere can start to be important for γ = 4 / 3, too. So in the case of a rapidly rotating NS the propeller stage can appear for reasonable accretion rates also for this value of the adiabatic index.

If the initial dipole magnetic field is strong and the spin period is short, then accretion is possible only for a very large accretion rate [formula] yr - 1. Such rates are not unexpected. For example, [\cite=che89] estimated the accretion rate for SN1987A as [formula] yr- 1 (lower values about tens of solar masses per year also have been reported by other authors).

[\cite=bern12] demonstrated that for such strong fall-back the field is rapidly (~  100 msec) submerged. Then it can diffuse out on a time scale of thousands or tens of thousand years [\citep=ho11] [\citep=vp12]. While the field is submerged the NS appears as an anti-magnetar. Rotation braking is very slow in this case. The spin period is nearly constant, frozen. A similar situation appears if the initial dipolar field was small, but the toroidal is large. In this case the accretion gates are opened even for lower [formula]. Discovery of an anti-magnetar with a large crustal field and a millisecond-scale spin period would be a proof for a dynamo-mechanism field origin. Oppositely, PSR J1852+0040 (with its large spin period) most probably represents a counter example.

In PSR J1852+0040 the present day spin period is nearly the same as the initial one because [formula] is low due to the low field and the relatively long spin period. And it is easy to estimate that no spin-down mechanism (magneto-rotational or similar ones, propeller, interaction with a disc, etc.) can slow the rotation from few milliseconds down to 100 msec in a very short time before the field is buried.

One of the most effective spin-down mechanisms ever discussed was proposed by [\cite=shakura] (see a list of other spin-down formulae for the propeller stage in [\citealt=lp95]):

[formula]

Here [formula] is the magnetospheric (Alfven) radius, ω = 2π / p -- is the spin frequency, and I -- is the moment of inertia of a NS. Eq. (2) can be rewritten as:

[formula]

[formula]

Despite the exponential spin-down during this stage, field submergence (as numerical experiments indicate) happens so rapidly, that the period cannot be increased by a factor ~  100. Obviously, normal magneto-dipole spindown is less effective, and a newborn magnetar cannot be slowed down significantly due to this mechanism.

We conclude, that a strong crustal toroidal magnetic field in Kes 79 could not be generated with a dynamo mechanism.

DISCUSSION

[\cite=sl12] comment that the field configuration they obtained can be not a unique one which explains the large pulse fraction of PSR J1852+0040. This means that we cannot be sure if the dipolar component of the field was strong before the fall-back episode, or not.

[\cite=bern12] mention that the accretion of magnetized matter can modify the magnetic field of a NS, reducing the dipolar component while making the general shape of the field configuration more complicated. If this is the case for PSR J1852+0040, than it can be much different from normal magnetars. Even if the strength of toroidal field in the crust is high, the total energy of the field can be orders of magnitude smaller than in magnetars [\citep=pons]. Probably, an effective dynamo mechanism is not necessary in this case. Then accretion could start for 100 msec period even for relatively low accretion rates.

High accretion rates normally result in a large total accreted mass, comparable with the mass of the crust. Roughly, the mass of the crust is accreted in one hour for the rate [formula] yr- 1:

[formula]

The total accreted mass can be up to few tenths of solar mass [\citep=che89]. A NS which experienced such strong fall-back episode can so much more massive that it follows a different cooling history. In all scenarios massive NSs are colder [\citep=yakovlev] [\citep=page] [\citep=blaschke]. As far as the NS in Kes 79 is a hot source, then an additional heating mechanism is required. It can be easily provided due to rapid magnetic field decay in the crust, as the field is confined in a narrow layer (see, for example, [\citealt=gpz99]).

It would be important to estimate for PSR J1852+0040 the total amount of accreted matter. This can allow the calculation of the maximum accrection rate during the fall-back. Then all estimates above can be made in a more robust way.

As a determination of initial spin periods for known magnetars is impossible, a promising way to get solid arguments in favour of the dynamo mechanism hypothesis is to find a real "frozen magnetar". In the modern picture of unified NS population (see, for example, [\citealt=geppert] for description of different possibilities and evolutionary histories, especially their Fig. 2 for evolutionary tracks) such sources are quite natural. However, they must be relatively rare.

Magnetars form up to 10% of all NSs as both observations and population synthesis studies indicate (see [\citealt=gillheyl2007], and also [\citealt=popov] for a unified desription of magnetars, pulsars and cooling NSs, and references therein). If we assume that the submergence of the magnetic field happens in magnetars as often, as in other NSs, and that CCOs are NSs with submerged fields, then the number of "frozen" magnetars is [formula]% of the number of CCOs. However, it is natural to assume that the larger the fields, the more difficult it is to bury them. Then, the fraction of "frozen magnetars" is even lower. In addition, if magnetars are born in binary systems where spin of the progenitor was increased due to interaction with the companion [\citep=pp2006] [\citep=bp2009], then the amount of fall-back can be smaller as a significant part of the outer layers of the star are already removed (this was mentioned, for example, by [\citealt=che89]). The problem of identification (the detectability of millisecond periods for complicated field topology in the crust, pulse profiles, etc.) also can prevent easy discovery of "frozen magnetars" (but see a recent discussion in [\citealt=perna13]). On the other hand, an additional energy source - field decay - can help such sources to stay bright for a longer time, which favours their discovery [\citep=heyl1998].

CONCLUSIONS

The CCO in Kes 79 has a relatively long spin period (0.1 s) and might have a strong crustal field [\citep=sl12]. We argue that this field could not be generated by a dynamo mechanism as, on one hand, known mechanisms of NS spin down applicable in the case of this source cannot slow down rotation form ~   msec to the present day period before the field is buried, on the other -- the present day low field excludes also a significant spin-down during the lifetime of the source. Discovery of a "frozen magnetar" -- a CCO-like source with a millisecond period and indications of a strong crustal field, - would be a strong argument in favour of the dynamo mechanism scenario by [\cite=dt92].
