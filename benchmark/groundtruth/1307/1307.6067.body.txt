Charge tuning of non-resonant magneto-exciton phonon interactions in graphene

When Dirac fermions in graphene are subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field B, the electronic states form discrete, degenerate Landau levels (LL) with energy of [formula] (n is the Landau level index) [\cite=neto2009electronic] [\cite=goerbig2011electronic]. Each level has spin(2) and valley(2) degeneracy with a system occupancy described by the filling factor [formula], where [formula] is the surface density of charges [\cite=goerbig2007filling]. At charge neutrality ν  =  0 and the n = 0 level is half filled. A coherent superposition of inter-LL magneto-excitons and phonons can occur when the magnetic field is tuned so that an allowed LL transition is in resonance with the phonon energy [\cite=ando2007magnetic] [\cite=goerbig2007filling] [\cite=goerbig2011electronic]. Systems where the electronic and phonon dephasing is smaller than the electron-phonon interaction strength show pronounced anticrossings of the energy of the phonon and magneto-exciton states [\cite=ando2007magnetic] [\cite=goerbig2007filling] [\cite=goerbig2011electronic] [\cite=PhysRevB.84.235138] [\cite=kim2012magnetophonon] [\cite=yan2010observation] [\cite=kuhne2012polarization] [\cite=faugeras2011magneto] [\cite=yan2010observation]. The first observation of strong electron-phonon coupling at resonance conditions was made by Raman spectroscopy of magneto-phonons in multi-layer graphene on SiC. However the sample was not pristine enough to exhibit coherent phonon magneto-exciton states[\cite=faugeras2009tuning]. Coherent magneto-phonon Raman response has since been observed in graphite [\cite=PhysRevB.84.235138] [\cite=kim2012magnetophonon] [\cite=yan2010observation] and decoupled surface layers of graphene on graphite crystals [\cite=kuhne2012polarization] [\cite=faugeras2011magneto] [\cite=yan2010observation]. Recently, magneto-phonon resonances have also been observed on single layer graphene exfoliated on SiO2 [\cite=PhysRevLett.110.227402] [\cite=kossacki2012circular].

Magneto-exciton transitions couple to orthogonal states of the degenerate modes of the G-band phonon. Symmetry allowed transitions obey the selection rule [formula] [\cite=PhysRevB.84.235138]. Experimentally selective excitation of the orthogonal states is achieved using cross circular polarized optical excitation and detection channels. In a σ+  /  σ- configuration, only states coupling to Δn =  + 1 transitions can be observed, while only states coupling to Δn =  - 1 transitions are observed in σ-  /  σ+ polarization configuration [\cite=kossacki2012circular] [\cite=PhysRevLett.110.227402] [\cite=PhysRevB.84.235138] [\cite=kuhne2012polarization]. These selection rules create optical dichroism for doped graphene [\cite=goerbig2007filling] [\cite=ando2007magnetic] and have been observed in graphene on SiO2 due to partial Pauli blocking of the initial or final Landau level states [\cite=PhysRevLett.110.227402] [\cite=kossacki2012circular]. High quality graphene on SiC or on graphite can be considered charge neutral, while exfoliated graphene on SiO2 typically shows accidental doping from sample preparation and impurities in the substrate. So far, only limited control of the doping level [formula] has been achieved by annealing and gas exposure in between scanned B-field measurements [\cite=PhysRevLett.110.227402]. However, for constant [formula] the filling factor ν varies with the B-field strength. We use graphene field effect devices, widely used in transport [\cite=novoselov2004electric] [\cite=novoselov2005two] [\cite=zhang2005experimental] as well as Raman measurements [\cite=pisana2007breakdown] [\cite=yan2007electric] [\cite=stampfer2007raman] to provide full control of the charge density and decouple the effects of magnetic field and filling factor dependence.

Here we show for the first time charge carrier density dependent magneto Raman measurements on single layer graphene field effect devices at constant magnetic fields. Contrary to previous magneto-phonon studies, we explore the Raman response in a magnetic field far from magneto-phonon resonance conditions. We predict a linear dependence with ν for the non-resonant regime, rather than the [formula] behavior predicted for the on-resonance response. Notably, at constant magnetic field we observe pronounced splittings and slope changes of the G-band phonon energy as a function of ν, the LL filling. We show that the structure in the electron-phonon coupling is due to the occupancy of Landau level magneto-exciton transitions coupled to the phonon. In contrast to on-resonance measurements, no single transition dominates the coupling, and several inter and intra-band transitions have to be considered to account for the experimental observations. Splitting is due to the different filling factor dependent response to left and right hand polarized light.

For control of the charge carrier density we fabricated field effect devices based on single layer graphene where the charge density is controlled by the gate voltage. Graphene is exfoliated onto a 300 nm thick SiO2/Si substrate and the devices are fabricated using standard microfabrication processes. We confirm the single layer character by Raman spectroscopy and measurement of the optical contrast [\cite=ferrari2006raman] [\cite=casiraghi2007rayleigh] [\cite=ni2007graphene] [\cite=blake2007making].

Raman measurements are performed at 4K in a He bath cryostat, schematically drawn in Fig. [\ref=setup](a). The sample is mounted on a piezoelectric x-y-z stage at the focus of a confocal, free-space microscope cooled with He exchange gas and placed in the center of a superconducting magnet with an accessible range of [formula]. The Raman response is excited using a HeNe Laser at λ = 632.8  nm with a diffraction limited spot size ~  1  μm. The excitation laser is linearly polarized, although we do not monitor or optimize the polarization. Since our experiment uses linear polarized light without an analyzer, we measure both σ+  /  σ- and σ-  /  σ+ transitions, i.e. both [formula] transitions are detected simultaneously. Scattered light is filtered by a long pass filter to remove the laser light, collected by a single mode fiber and analyzed using a conventional grating spectrometer.

Fig. [\ref=setup](b) illustrates the effect of applying a backgate voltage Vbg at finite magnetic field of B = 12.6  T. For ν =  - 4.7 (Vbg =  - 20  V) the G-band is symmetric with a single peak (black line), but splits into 2 peaks for ν =  - 1.8 (Vbg =  - 8  V) due to the interaction of the optical phonons with the discrete Landau levels [\cite=kias2009] .

Characterization of the phonon response versus charge density was performed by Raman spectroscopy while sweeping the backgate in the range [formula] both at B = 0  T as well as B = 12.6  T. Fig. [\ref=bcompare] shows a Raman intensity map of the observed spectra as a function of Vbg. We extract the position of the G-band by fitting the spectra with single (B = 0  T) and double lorentzian (B = 12.6  T) functions shown in Fig. [\ref=bcompare](c) and (d).

Measurements results at B = 0  T are shown in Fig. [\ref=bcompare](a) and (c). The behavior of the G-band as a function of charge density has previously been studied theoretically and experimentally [\cite=pisana2007breakdown] [\cite=yan2007electric] [\cite=stampfer2007raman] [\cite=tsuneya2006anomaly]. We use the model of [\cite=tsuneya2006anomaly] to fit the data, and also include the effects of inhomogeneous broadening due to charge carrier density fluctuations [\cite=yan2007electric]. In Fig. [\ref=bcompare](c) we plot the fit results (red dashed line) as a function of Vbg, and extract the following system parameters: The electron-phonon coupling strength λ  =  4.8  ×  10- 3, the phenomenological broadening parameter [\cite=tsuneya2006anomaly] δ = 10  meV, the unperturbed phonon energy at B = 0  T, ε = 1582.0  cm- 1, the inhomogeneous broadening [formula] (standard deviation of a Gaussian distribution) and finally the Fermi velocity vF = 1.10  ×  106  ms- 1. For more details on the qualitative and quantitative description at B = 0  T we refer to the supplementary material.

Fig. [\ref=bcompare](b) and (d) shows a very different behavior for B = 12.6  T. G-band splitting starts around ν=- 6 (Vbg ≈   - 25  V) then reaches a maximum at ν=- 2 (Vbg  ≈   - 9  V), disappears at ν=0 (Vbg  =  0  V) and repeats symmetrically for ν > 0. The largest magnitude of the splitting is ~  12  cm- 1. At B = 12.6  T, the nearest magneto-phonon resonances are the transitions between [formula] and [formula] at B = 25  T and [formula] and [formula] at B = 4.1  T.

Following [\cite=goerbig2007filling] [\cite=ando2007magnetic] [\cite=kossacki2012circular] we consider the phonon energy εA in Eqn. ([\ref=greens-full]). The index A denotes the two orthogonal circularly polarized phonon states accessed by σ+ or σ- circularly polarized light.

[formula]

Here ε0 is the unperturbed phonon energy, λ is the dimensionless electron-phonon coupling parameter and δ is the phenomenological broadening introduced by Ando [\cite=ando2007magnetic]. The two sums are the contribution from all the interband and intraband asymmetric transitions (see Fig. [\ref=bfield](a)). The interband transitions have energy [formula] and intraband transitions [formula] where [formula]. For B = 12.6  T, T0  ≈  140  meV compared with ~  196  meV for the G band phonon. The filling factor dependence of the coupling to the highly degenerate Landau level states is described by the factor fA,n. For interband transitions fA,n is defined by

[formula]

Here n is the normalized filling factor describing the fraction of filling of the n’th Landau level. It is related to the filling factor ν by [formula] since each Landau level state is fourfold degenerate. Hence 0 < n < 1. The definition of fA,n for intraband transition is easily obtained by replacing the index ∓  n by ±  n. In Fig. [\ref=bfield](a) we illustrate the level occupation for a filling factor ν = 2, i.e. the n = 0 level is completely filled (partial filling factor 0 = 1). Hence, the transition between n =  - 1 and n = 0 is Pauli blocked (dashed lines in figure) and fσ-,0 = 0, while all transitions originating from the n=0 level have maximum strength due to the high density of occupied states that can be excited, with fσ+,0 = 1.

Eqn. ([\ref=greens-full]) is valid for all B fields and charge states, although it is cumbersome to use. Near resonance, a single resonant term dominates, so other terms can be neglected in solving Eqn. ([\ref=greens-full]). The solution is described by a two-level coupled mode model [\cite=yan2010observation] [\cite=PhysRevLett.110.227402]

[formula]

Eqn. ([\ref=resonant-shift]) describes the anticrossing between the coherent coupled states ε±A. The index ±   refers to the upper and lower branches of the anticrossing.

In the non-resonant regime, where our experiment is performed, the approximation leading to Eqn. ([\ref=resonant-shift]) is not valid. Since ΔεA  =  εA  -  ε0 is small, Eqn. ([\ref=greens-full]) can be linearized by noting that ε2A  -  ε20  ≈  (εA  -  ε0)2ε0, and replacing the εA in the denominator by the unperturbed phonon frequency ε0 [\cite=ando2007magnetic]. The shift of the G-band in the non-resonant regime is then given by

[formula]

The expressions Eqn. ([\ref=resonant-shift]) and Eqn. ([\ref=greens]) are distinguished by the numbers of terms needed, and by their different filling factor dependence. In the resonance approximation Eqn. ([\ref=resonant-shift]) the shift is proportional to [formula] while in the non-resonant case Eqn. ([\ref=greens]) is linear in the filling factor ν.

We now consider the effect of the charge tuning in Eqn. ([\ref=greens]) with fixed B field. In order to evaluate the contributions from participating inter- and intra-band transitions, we calculate the individual contribution to the phonon energy shift Δεn from each term in Eqn. ([\ref=greens]) evaluated at B = 12.6  T. Shown in Fig. [\ref=bfield](b) are the Δεn for the lowest lying inter- and intra-band transitions for σ+ polarization, i.e. transitions with Δn =  + 1. We use the values for ε0, λ, vF and δ from the B = 0  T fit. Curves are labeled as Tn (red shaded) for inter-band and Sn (green shaded) for intra-band transitions, normalized by λT0. The largest contribution is due to the T0 term which shows a strong peak at ν = 2. The contributions from the remaining inter-band transitions are strong as well. The shift due to the T1 term is 28% and the T2 term is still at 17.9% relative to the shift caused by the T0 term. The action of intra-band terms are restricted to a smaller range of ν values, but their strength can be significant nevertheless (S1/T0 ≈   10%). The case of σ- polarization is completely symmetric relative to the point ν  =  0.

Finally, we combine these contributions and compare to our experimental data (Fig. [\ref=bfield](c)). We only include the first 5 terms of Eqn. ([\ref=greens]) in our calculation, since the neglected terms only cause a small overall downshift of ~   - 1cm- 1 in the range of our measurement (See supplementary material). The phonon energy is plotted versus filling factor rather than charge density to highlight the correspondence between the filled Landau levels and the extrema of kinks in the slope (orange lines). The solid red and blue lines are the numerical results for the energies εσ+ and εσ-. We emphasize that no adjustable parameters have been used to compare data and theory at B = 12.6  T - all parameters are determined from the B = 0 data. The splitting between εσ+ and εσ- is maximal at ν =  - 2 and ν = 2 where the coupling strength to the T0 transitions corresponding to [formula] respectively are strongest. Fig. [\ref=bfield](b) also explains the kink in slope [formula] due to Pauli blocking of T0 and T1 transitions. The upshift with increasing |ν| is caused by the linear decrease of the T1 transition as the LL [formula] are filled or emptied, respectively. In principle scanning to larger absolute value |ν| will reveal higher and higher n transitions. There is some evidence in the data of a small contribution from the symmetric transitions Δn  =  0 [\cite=PhysRevB.84.235138] at the same reduced coupling strength seen by [\cite=faugeras2011magneto] [\cite=kuhne2012polarization], however, it is not conclusive (see supplementary material). We could not resolve the small splitting of ~  1  cm- 1 between εσ+ and εσ- for [formula] predicted by the model.

The extracted values of Fermi velocity vF = 1.1  ×  106  ms- 1 and electron phonon coupling λ = 4.8  ×  10- 3 agree well with those determined in previous experiments on SiO2 [\cite=PhysRevLett.110.227402] [\cite=kossacki2012circular]. However, for graphene on graphite, a lower vF, and a 23% higher value of λ is reported [\cite=yan2010observation]. (See supplementary material for further discussion).

By focusing on the non-resonant regime we have discovered fine structure in the G-band optical phonon in single layer graphene at high magnetic fields as a function of charge density. The observed behavior is caused by coupling between the phonon and magneto-exciton far from resonance that results in a linear dependence on filling factor, in contrast to on-resonant coupling that leads to a square root dependence on filling factor. High magnetic field Raman scattering with electrostatic tuning of the charge carrier density allows us to explore the filling factor dependent coupling strength of orthogonal, non-resonant magneto-phonon states as they are being turned on and off. By including coupling to many Landau level transitions we show qualitative and quantitative agreement with numerical calculations of a linearized model of electron-phonon interactions in magnetic fields. The measured coupling strength, broadening and Fermi velocity is in good agreement with independent observations at B = 0  T and earlier experiments.
