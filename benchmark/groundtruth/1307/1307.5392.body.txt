Introduction

Transversals play an important role in characterizing the group and the embedding of subgroup in the group. In [\cite=tm], Tarski monsters has been characterized with the help of transversals. In [\cite=p], Lal shows that if all subgroups of a finitely generated solvable group are stable (any right transversals of a subgroup have isomorphic group torsion), then the group is nilpotent. In [\cite=ict2], it has been shown that if the isomorphism classes of transversals of a subgroup in a finite group is 3, then the subgroup itself has index 3. Converse of this fact is also true. In this paper we will characterize solvability of group in terms of a generating transversal of a core-free subgroup. Also we will propose some problems.

In [\cite=rltr], it has been shown that each right transversal is a right loop with respect to the operation induced by the operation of the group. Let us see how. Let G be a finite group and H a proper core-free subgroup of G. A right transversal is a subset of G obtained by selecting one and only one element from each right coset of H in G and identity from the coset H. Now we will call it transversal in place of right transversal. Suppose that S is a transversal of H in G. We define an operation [formula] on S as follows: for x,y∈S, [formula]. It is easy to check that [formula] is a right loop, that is the equation of the type [formula], X is unknown and a,b∈S has unique solution in S and [formula] has both sided identity. In [\cite=rltr], it has been shown that for each right loop there exists a pair (G,H) such that H is a core-free subgroup of the group G and the given right loop can be identified with a tansversal of H in G. Not all transversals of a subgroup generate the group. But it is proved by Cameron in [\cite=pjc], that if a subgroup is core-free, then always there exists a transversal which generates the whole group. We call such a transversal as generating transversal.

The difference between right loop and group is the associativity of operation. In [\cite=rltr], a notion of group torsion is introduced which measures the deviation of a right loop from being a group. Let us explain. Let [formula] be a right loop (identity denoted by 1). Let x,y,z∈S. Define a map fS(y,z) from S to S as follows: fS(y,z)(x) is the unique solution of the equation [formula], where X is unknown. It is easy to verify that fS(y,z) is a bijective map. We denote by GS the subgroup of Sym(S), the symmetric group on S generated by the set {fS(y,z)|y,z∈S}. This group is called group torsion of S [\cite=rltr]. Further, it acts on S through the action θS defined as: for x∈S and h∈GS; xθSh: = h(x). Also note that right multiplication by an element of S gives a bijective map from S to S, that is an element of Sym(S). The subgroup generated by this type of elements in Sym(S) is denoted by GSS because GS is a subgroup of it and the right multiplication map associated with the elements of S form a transversal of GS in GSS. Note that if H is core-free subgroup of a group G and S is a transversal of H in G. Then [formula] such that [formula] [\cite=rltr].

In this paper we will prove following two results:

If a finite group has a solvable generating transversal with respect to a core-free subgroup, then the group is solvable.

Note that by a solvable transversal we mean a transversal which is solvable with respect to induced right loop structure and solvability of right loop is introduced in Definition [\ref=s].

Suppose that S is a right loop and T is its invariant sub right loop such that the quotient S / T is a group. Then the group torsion of S will be elementary abelian 2-group.

Definitions and Lemmas

Now for defining solvability of a right loop, we need following basic definitions and results.

[\cite=rps] An equivalence relation R on a right loop S is called a congruence in S, if it is a sub right loop of S  ×  S.

[\cite=rps] An equivalence class of identity of a congruence is called invariant sub right loop.

Suppose that I is an invariant sub right loop of a right loop [formula]. Then [formula] is a congruence in S (for details see [\cite=rps]) such that the equivalence class of identity R1 = I.

If R is a congruence on a right loop [formula] and R1 denotes the equivalence class of identity, then the set [formula] together with operation [formula] defined as [formula], is a right loop. Now onwards we will use the operation of S to denote the operation of S / R1. Note that S / R1 is also denoted as S / R.

Let [formula] be a right quasigroup with identity. Let R be the congruence on S generated by {(x,xθSfS(y,z)) ~ |x,y,z∈S}. Then R is the smallest congruence on S such that the quotient right loop S / R is a group.

First, we will show that S / R is a group. Let 1 denote the identity of S. Since R is a congruence on S, R1 (equivalence class of 1 under R) is an invariant sub right loop of S. So for showing that S / R is a group, it is sufficient to show that the binary operation of S / R is associative. Let x,y,z∈S. Then

[formula]

Hence S / R is a group. Let φ:S  →  S / R be the quotient homomorphism ([formula]). Let H be a group with a homomorphism (of right loops) φ' ~ :  ~  S  →  H. Since φ' is a homomorphism of right loops, φ'(S) is a sub right loop of H. Further, since the binary operation on φ'(S) is associative, it is a subgroup of H. It is easy to verify that Kerφ' is an invariant sub right loop, that is there exists a congruence K on S such that K1 = Kerφ' (by Remark [\ref=r3]). By the Fundamental Theorem of homomorphisms for right loops there exists a unique one-one homomorphism ' ~ :S / K  →  H such that [formula], where ν:S  →  S / K is the quotient homomorphism ([formula]). Since S / K is a group (being isomorphic to the subgroup φ'(S) of H), the associativity of its binary operation implies that (x,xθSfS(y,z))∈K for all x,y,z∈S. This implies R  ⊆  K. This defines an onto homomorphism η from S / R to S / K given by [formula]. Let [formula]. Then it follows easily that η' is the unique homomorphism from S / R to H such that [formula].

Let S and R be as in the above Lemma. Let T be a congruence on S containing R. Since T1 / R1 is an invariant sub right loop of S / R1, it is a normal subgroup of S / R1. Thus S / T is a group for it is isomorphic to S / R1 / (T1 / R1).

It is easy to prove following lemma.

Let [formula] be a right loop. Let L be the congruence on S generated by [formula]. Then L is the smallest congruence on S such that the quotient right loop S / L is an abelian group.

We define S(1) to be the smallest invariant sub right loop of S such that S / S(1) is an abelian group that is, if there is another invariant sub right loop N such that S / N is an abelian group, then S(1)  ⊆  N.

We define S(n) by induction. Suppose S(n - 1) is defined. Then S(n) is an invariant sub right loop of S such that S(n) = (S(n - 1))(1).

Note that if S is a group, then S(1) is the commutator subgroup and S(n) is the nth-commutator subgroup.

We call S solvable if there exists an [formula] such that S(n)  =  {1}.

Let G be a group, H a subgroup of G and S a transversal of H in G. Suppose that [formula] containing H. Then

[formula]

Suppose that [formula] denotes the induced right loop operation on S. Consider the map ψ:S  →  HS / N defined as ψ(x) = xN. This is a homomorphism, for

[formula]

Also, [formula] Since for h∈H ~  and ~ x∈S, we have hxN = xN and ψ(x) = xN, ψ is onto and so by the Fundamental Theorem of homomorphisms for right loops, [formula].

Let G be a group, H a subgroup and S a transversal of H in G. Suppose that [formula] is the induced right loop structure on S. We define a map f:S  ×  S  →  H as: for x,y∈S, [formula]. We further define the action θ of H on S as [formula] where h∈H and x∈S. With these notations it is easy to prove following lemma.

For x,y,z∈S, we have xθSfS(y,z) = xθf(y,z).

Let H be a subgroup of a group G and S a transversal of H in G. Let T be the congruence on S such that {(x,xθh) ~ | ~ h∈H,x∈S}  ⊆  T. Then S / T is a group. Moreover, [formula] (and so [formula] and  [formula] and [formula], where T1 denotes the equivalence class of 1 under T.

By Lemma [\ref=l4], xθf(y,z) = xθSfS(y,z) for all x,y,z∈S. Then by Lemma [\ref=gl2], R  ⊆  T and by Remark [\ref=gr3], S / T is a group. Let φ:G  →  S / T be the map defined by [formula]. This is a homomorphism, because for all h1, ~ h2∈H and x1, ~ x2∈S,

[formula]

Let h∈H and x∈S. Then hx∈Kerφ if and only if x∈T1. Hence Kerφ  =  HT1 = N(say). This proves the lemma.

Proof of Theorems

Let G be a finite group and H a core-free subgroup of it. Suppose that S is a generating transversal of H in G. Then the group G can be written as HS. By Lemma [\ref=a], [formula]. So,

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=b], HS(1) is normal subgroup of G. Thus G / HS(1) = S / S(1) (Lemma [\ref=a]). Since S / S(1) is abelian, G(1)  ⊆  HS(1). Thus

[formula]

From [\eqref=(ii)] and [\eqref=(i)], it is clear that

[formula]

and

[formula]

We will use induction to prove that, HS(n)  =  H(HS(n - 1))(1) for n  ≥  1 and by S(0) we mean S. For n = 1, HS(1)  =  HG(1)  =  H(HS(0))(1) (by [\eqref=(iii)(b)]). By induction, suppose that HS(n - 1)  =  H(HS(n - 2))(1). Since [formula] is an abelian group, (HS(n - 1))(1)  ⊆  HS(n). Thus H(HS(n - 1))(1)   ⊆  HS(n).

Now, HS(n - 1) / H(HS(n - 1))(1) [formula] (Lemma [\ref=a]). So [formula]. That is,

[formula]

Now [\eqref=(*)] implies that

[formula]

Proceeding inductively, we have HS(n)  ⊇  H(HS)(n) = HG(n). Suppose that S is solvable, that is there exists [formula] such that S(n)  =  {1}. Then (G)(n)  ⊆  H. Since (G)(n) is normal subgroup of G contained in H, so (G)(n)  =  {1}. This proves the theorem.

Converse of the above theorem is not true. For example take G to be the Symmetric group on three symbols and H to be any two order subgroup of it. Then H has no solvable generating transversal but we know that G is solvable. Following is the easy consequence of the above theorem.

If S is a finite solvable right loop, then GSS is solvable.

Suppose that T = {1,t}. Since T is an invariant sub right loop, so t is fixed by all the elements of GS. Consider the equation [formula]. Since S / T has associativity, so [formula]. Since S / T is a group, so by cancellation law we have [formula]. This implies [formula]. Note that for each y,z∈S, an element x∈S is either fixed by fS(y,z) or [formula]. Suppose that [formula]. Since fS(y,z) is bijective, so [formula]. Then [formula]. Thus either x is fixed by fS(y,z) or there is a transposition [formula] in the cycle decomposition of fS(y,z). That is fS(y,z) can be written as a product of disjoint transpositions. This clearly implies that GS  =  〈{fS(y,z)|y,z∈S}〉 is an elementary abelian 2-group. This proves the theorem.

Following is a known result (can be proved independently) follows from Theorem [\ref=2].

Let G be a finite group and H a core-free subgroup contained in a normal subgroup N such that the index of H in N is 2. Then N is an elementary abelian 2-group.

Some Problems

It is an interesting problem to find condition on a right loop S such that GSS holds some group theoretical property. For example, what is the minimum condition on right loop S for which GSS is a nilpotent group?
