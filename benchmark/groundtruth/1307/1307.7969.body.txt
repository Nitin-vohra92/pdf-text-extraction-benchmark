HIGHER-ORDER LORENTZ VIOLATION

Introduction

The Standard-Model Extension (SME) provides a general framework for theoretical and experimental studies of Lorentz and CPT violation.[\cite=datatables] Most early research focused on the minimal SME (mSME), which restricts attention to operators of renormalizable dimensions d = 3 and 4 in flat spacetime.[\cite=ck] However, the full SME encompasses curved spacetime[\cite=smegrav] and includes operators of arbitrary dimension. Here, we give a brief discussion of recent efforts to classify terms in the photon and neutrino sectors of the SME, including those of nonrenormalizable dimensions d  ≥  5. Details can be found in Refs.  and . A summary of experimental results is given in Ref. .

Photons

The pure photon sector of the SME is given by the lagrangian[\cite=km09]

[formula]

In addition to the usual Maxwell term, there are two Lorentz-violating terms involving the CPT-odd four-vector [formula] and CPT-even tensor (F)κλμν. Both [formula] and (F)κλμν are constants in the mSME but are momentum dependent in the full SME, where they each take the form of a power series in photon momentum. The expansion constants in the series give coefficients for Lorentz violation.

The total number of coefficients for Lorentz violation that appear in the expansions of [formula] and (F)κλμν grows rapidly (~  d3) as we consider higher dimensions. To aid in classifying the numerous coefficients, a spherical-harmonic expansion of [formula] and (F)κλμν is performed, giving sets of spherical coefficients for Lorentz violation that can be tested by different types of experiment. Several classes of experiment provide high sensitivity to various subsets of the coefficients, including searches for astrophysical birefringence and dispersion, and resonant-cavity tests. Below is a summary of coefficients that have been experimentally tested thus far.

Birefringent vacuum coefficients. The coefficients k(d)(E)jm, k(d)(B)jm, and k(d)(V)jm lead to birefringence of light propagating in vacuo. The result is a change in polarization as light propagates. The effect can depend on the direction of propagation and photon energy. Polarimetry of radiation from distant astrophysical sources has led to many constraints on the mSME coefficients[\cite=bire_renorm] [\cite=kmapjl] and nonminimal coefficients up to dimension d = 9.[\cite=km09] [\cite=bire_nonrenorm]

Nonbirefringent vacuum coefficients. The coefficients c(d)(I)jm affect the propagation of light in a polarization-independent way, implying no birefringence. However, they do lead to vacuum dispersion for d  ≥  6. Time-of-flight tests involving high-energy sources, such as γ-ray bursts, search for differences in arrival times of photons at different energies. Again, this effect can depend on the photon energy and direction of propagation. Constraints on the c(d)(I)jm coefficients for d = 6 and 8 have been found.[\cite=km09] [\cite=kmapjl] [\cite=fermi]

Camouflage coefficients. A large class of Lorentz violation has no effect on the propagation of light. These violations are referred to as vacuum orthogonal. Among them are the so-called camouflage violations, which generically give polarization-independent effects, in addition to giving conventional light propagation. As a result, the effects of the associated camouflage coefficients [formula] are particularly subtle. They can, however, be tested in resonant-cavity experiments, where they lead to tiny shifts in resonant frequencies.[\cite=km09] [\cite=cavity_theory] Numerous cavity searches for d = 4 coefficients have been performed.[\cite=cavity_expt] A recent experiment placed the first cavity bounds on nonminimal d = 6 and 8 camouflage coefficients.[\cite=parker]

Neutrinos

Neutrinos in the SME are governed by a 6  ×  6 effective hamiltonian that acts on the six-dimensional space that includes both neutrinos and antineutrinos. The Lorentz-violating part of the hamiltonian takes the form[\cite=km12]

[formula]

The 3  ×  3 matrices âeff, eff, qeff, and Ĥeff are functions of the neutrino momentum vector [formula], giving rise to unusual direction dependence and an unconventional energy-momentum relation. Note that the qeff, and Ĥeff terms cause mixing between neutrinos and antineutrinos. The eff and Ĥeff matrices contain the CPT-even violations, while the CPT-odd terms are in âeff and qeff. As with photons, a spherical-harmonic expansion is used to enumerate and classify the various effects and coefficients. For example, the âeff matrix has the expansion [formula], giving spherical coefficients for Lorentz violation [formula]. Most research in neutrinos, so far, focuses on one of the following cases.

Oscillation coefficients. Except for a small subset of flavor-diagonal coefficients, most of the spherical coefficients, [formula], [formula], [formula], and [formula], produce oscillations. Signatures of Lorentz violation in oscillations include direction dependence, unconventional energy dependence, neutrino-antineutrino oscillations, and CPT asymmetries. Neutrino oscillations are interferometric in nature, so high sensitivity to Lorentz violation is possible. While some bounds on coefficients up to d = 10 have been deduced from earlier analyses,[\cite=km12] most of the research so far has focused on the d = 3 and 4 cases,[\cite=nu_theory] with many constraints on mSME coefficients.[\cite=nu_expt]

Oscillation-free coefficients. Lorentz violation also affects the kinematics of neutrino propagation. Kinematic effects are characterized, independent of oscillations, in the simple oscillation-free limit, where oscillations are neglected, and all neutrinos are treated the same. The energy in this limit is given by

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] are oscillation-free coefficients. This provides a framework for a range of studies, such as time-of-flight tests, analyses of meson-decay thresholds, and Cerenkov-like decays of neutrinos, each of which has produced constraints on coefficients up to d = 10.[\cite=km12] [\cite=alt]
