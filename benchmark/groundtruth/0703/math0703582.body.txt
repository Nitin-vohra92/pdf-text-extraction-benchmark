Frames and bases in tensor products of Hilbert spaces and Hilbert [formula]-modules

Introduction

Gabor [\cite=Ga], in 1946 introduced a technique for signal processing which eventually led to wavelet theory. Later in 1952, Duffin and Schaeffer [\cite=sh] in the context of nonharmonic Fourier series introduced frame theory for Hilbert spaces. In 1986, Daubechies, and Meyer [\cite=dgm] showed that Duffin and Schaeffer's definition was an abstraction of Gabor's concept. Frames are used in signal processing, image processing, data compression, sampling theory, migrating the effect of losses in packet-based communication systems and improving the robustness of data transmission. Since tensor product is useful in the approximation of multi-variate functions of combinations of univariate ones, Khosravi and Asgari [\cite=ka] introduced frames in tensor product of Hilbert spaces. Meanwhile, the notion of frames in Hilbert C*-modules was introduced and some of their properties were investigated [\cite=fornasier] [\cite=FL1] [\cite=FL2] [\cite=Heilw] [\cite=Lance]. In this article, we study the frames and bases in tensor product of Hilbert C*-modules which were introduced in [\cite=Lance] and we generalize the techniques of [\cite=ka] to C*-modules.

In § 2, we briefly recall the definitions and basic properties of Hilbert C*-modules. In § 3, we investigate tensor product of Hilbert C*-modules, which is introduced in [\cite=Lance] and we show that tensor product of frames for Hilbert C*-modules E and F, present frames for [formula], and tensor product of their frame operators is the frame operator of the tensor product of frames. We also show that tensor product of frames of subspaces produce a frame of subspaces for their tensor product. In § 4, we study resolution of the identity and prove that tensor product of any resolutions of H and K, is a resolution of the identity for [formula]. In § 5, we study the frame representation and we show that tensor product of frame vectors is a frame vector. Also we show that tensor product of analysis operators (resp. decomposition operators) is an analysis operator (resp. a decomposition operator).

Throughout this paper, [formula] and [formula] will denote the set of natural numbers and the set of complex numbers, respectively. A and B will be unital C*-algebras.

Preliminaries

Let I and J be countable index sets. In this section we briefly recall the definitions and basic properties of Hilbert C*-modules and frames in Hilbert C*-modules. For information about frames in Hilbert spaces we refer to [\cite=cas.art] [\cite=Heilw] [\cite=chrote] [\cite=young]. Our reference for C*-algebras is [\cite=mur] [\cite=Weg-alg]. For a C*-algebra A if a∈A is positive we write a  ≥  0 and A+ denotes the set of positive elements of A.

Main results

Let A and B be C*-algebras, E a Hilbert A-module and let F be a Hilbert B-module. We take [formula] as the completion of [formula] with the spatial norm. Hence [formula] is a C*-algebra and for every a∈A, b∈B we have [formula]. The algebraic tensor product [formula] is a pre-Hilbert [formula]-module with module action and [formula]-valued inner product We also know that for [formula] in [formula] we have and 〈z,z〉 = 0 if and only if z = 0. Just as in the case of ordinary pre-Hilbert space, we can form the completion [formula] of [formula], which is a Hilbert [formula]-module. It is called the tensor product of E and F (see [\cite=Lance]). We note that if a∈A+ and b∈B+, then [formula]. Plainly if a, b are hermitian elements of A and a  ≥  b, then for every positive element x of B, we have [formula].

Let {ui}i∈I be a frame for E with frame bounds A and B , and let {vj}j∈J be a frame for F with frame bounds C and D. Then [formula] is a frame for [formula] with frame bounds AC and BD. In particular , if {ui}i∈I and {vj}j∈J are tight or Parseval frames , then so is [formula].

Let x∈E and y∈F. Then we have

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

Now by (3), we have

[formula]

Consequently we have

[formula]

From these inequalities it follows that for all [formula] in [formula],

[formula]

Hence relation (4) holds for all z in [formula]. [formula]

From Theorem 1 of [\cite=bak] and the above lemma we have the following result.

It is clear that each [formula] is a basic element of [formula] and [formula] is an orthonormal system in [formula]. Now for each x∈E and each y∈F, we have [formula] and [formula]. Hence Similar to the above lemma we can show that for each z in [formula], we have [formula]. But Bakic and Guljas in Theorem 1 of [\cite=bak] showed that if W is a Hilbert C*-module over a C*-algebra A, and (vλ)λ∈Λ is an orthonormal system in W, then (vλ)λ∈Λ is an orthonormal basis for W if and only if for every w∈W, [formula]. Now by using this fact we have the result. [formula]

Let {ui}i∈I and {vj}j∈J be standard frames for E and F, respectively. So [formula] is a standard frame for [formula].

Let S, S' and S'' be the frame operators of {ui}i∈I, {vj}j∈J and [formula], respectively. So S is A-linear and S' is B-linear. Hence for every x∈E and y∈F, we have [formula], [formula]. Therefore

[formula]

Now by the uniqueness of frame operator we have [formula]. Hence [formula], which is a bounded [formula]-linear, self-adjoint, positive and invertible operator on [formula]. We note that [formula]. Now we summarize the above results as follows:

For the frame operator we prove the following result.

If {xi}i∈I is a frame in Hilbert A-module X with frame operator S and Q∈ End*A(X) is invertible , then {Qxi}i∈I is a frame in X with frame operator Q*  - 1SQ- 1.

Let {xi}i∈I be a frame of X with frame operator S. Then there exist constants A, B > 0 such that for every x∈X,

[formula]

and [formula]. Since Q is invertible and [formula], then Q is a bounded A-linear map with invertible adjoint Q*. So for every x∈X, we have

[formula]

Since Q is A-linear, [formula]. So [formula] Qxi, because Consequently, for every x∈X,

[formula]

Now by using (5) and (6) we have

[formula]

On the other hand, 〈Q*x,xi〉  =  〈x,Qxi〉, so {Qxi}i∈I is a frame for X and by (7), Q*  - 1SQ- 1 = (QS- 1Q*)- 1 is the frame operator of {Qxi}i∈I. [formula]

Since [formula], [formula] with inverse [formula]. It is obvious that [formula] is [formula]-linear, adjointable, with adjoint [formula]. An easy calculation shows that for every elementary tensor [formula],

[formula]

So [formula] is bounded, and therefore it can be extended to [formula]. Similarly for [formula]. Hence [formula] is [formula]-linear, adjointable with adjoint [formula], and as we mentioned in the proof of Lemma 3.4, Q* is invertible and bounded. Hence for every [formula], we have

[formula]

Hence [formula]. Now by the above lemma we have the result. [formula]

Now we generalize some of the results in [\cite=ka] to frame of subspaces. First we recall the definition of frame of subspaces (for basic definitions and properties, see [\cite=cas.sub]).

Let [formula] be an elementary tensor. Then [formula] and [formula].

A simple calculation shows that

[formula]

Hence Therefore

[formula]

Consequently, for every [formula] in [formula] and every z in [formula], the relation (9) holds. Hence we have the result. [formula]

Now we try to generalize a known result of frames (Proposition 3.1 of [\cite=ka]) to frames of subspaces.

Let [formula] be an elementary tensor. Therefore

[formula]

Now the uniqueness of frame operator implies that [formula] is the desired frame operator. [formula]

Let H and K be Hilbert spaces. A map [formula] is antilinear (or conjugate linear) if T(λx + y) = λ̄T(x) + T(y) for all [formula] and x,y∈H. By the techniques in [\cite=folland], [formula] is the set of anti-linear maps [formula] with the norm [formula] defined by So [formula] is the set of anti-linear maps [formula] and therefore [formula] is the map which assigns to every [formula], the restriction of [formula] to Zj, i.e. [formula].

Resolution of the identity

In this section we present the notion of [formula]-resolution of the identity with lower resolution bound in tensor product of Hilbert spaces (for more information see [\cite=cas.sub] [\cite=fornasier]).

Let f∈H, g∈K. Then [formula], [formula], and consequently

[formula]

Since both the series [formula] and [formula] are unconditionally convergent, the above series is unconditionally convergent. So for every [formula] and consequently for every [formula] the above relation holds. Let C, D and C', D' be the bounds of the resolutions {Ti} and {Sj}, respectively. Then for every f∈H, g∈K we have

[formula]

Now by using the fact that and [formula], we conclude that for every [formula] and consequently for every [formula] the relation (10) holds. [formula]

From the above proposition and Proposition 3.26 of [\cite=cas.sub] we have the following result.

Frame representation

Let H be a separable Hilbert space, and let G be a discrete countable abelian group. Let [formula] be a unitary representation of G on H. If there is a vector v∈H such that {π(g)v|g∈G} is a frame for H, then the representation π is called a frame representation. Let Ĝ denote the dual group of G, i.e., the group of characters on G and let λ be the normalized Haar measure on Ĝ. Let π:G  →  B(H) be a frame representation with frame vector v. As we have in [\cite=altw] [\cite=HL] [\cite=mur] there is a spectral measure E on Ĝ such that Since π is a frame representation, by using the results in § 2 of [\cite=altw] and the properties of spectral measure there is a unitary operator [formula], where F is a measurable subset of Ĝ with λ(F) > 0 and λ|F is the restriction of Haar measure λ to F such that U interwines the spectral measure on H and the canonical spectral measure on Ĝ. The operator U is called the decomposition operator. Moreover π is unitarily equivalent to the representation [formula] defined by σ(g) = Mg, where Mg is the multiplication operator with symbol g. In fact, U*MgU = π(g).

We also note that if θv is the analysis operator of H for frame vector v, then θvπ(g) = Lgθv, where [formula] is defined by (Lgx)(h) = x(g- 1h) for all h∈G. In fact, if J is the range of θv, then the representation π of G is unitarily equivalent to ρ = Lg|J (see Lemma 3 of [\cite=altw]). For more details see [\cite=altw] or [\cite=HL].

Let H and K be separable Hilbert spaces and let [formula] and [formula] be frame representations on H and K with frame vectors v∈H and w∈K, respectively. Since G1 and G2 are discrete countable abelian groups, their direct sum [formula] is a discrete countable abelian group. Hence we can consider the representation [formula] defined by Since [formula] is a frame for H and [formula] is a frame for K, by Lemma 3.1 and the definition of [formula], is a frame for [formula]. So [formula] is a frame representation of [formula] with frame vector [formula]. Moreover, if θv and θw are the analysis operators of H and K for frame vectors v and w, respectively, then [formula] is the analysis operator of [formula] for frame vector [formula]. Hence we have proved the following result.

For the decomposition operators we have the following result.

It is clear that [formula]. If [formula] and [formula], where   ⊇  E,   ⊇  F, then [formula] and [formula], where λ  ×  μ is the product measure of λ and μ. We note that for every x∈H, y∈K, the function [formula] defined on [formula] by [formula] and since [formula] is isomorphic to [formula] we can take [formula]. Since G1 and G2 form an orthonormal basis of L2(Ĝ1,λ) and L2(Ĝ2,μ), respectively (Corollary 4.26 of [\cite=folland]), a simple calculation shows that

[formula]

[formula]

First we note that for all x∈H, and Similarly Hence for every elementary tensor [formula] we have [formula] and

[formula]

So we have the result. [formula]

We can also state similar results for Bessel vectors.

Suppose π and σ are frame representations on H and K with frame vectors v and w , respectively. If v' and w' are Bessel vectors for π and σ , respectively , then [formula] is a Bessel vector for [formula].

By Theorem 5.1, [formula] is a frame representation with frame vector [formula], and since v' and w' are Bessel vectors for π and σ, respectively, there are constants C2 and C'2 such that

[formula]

Hence for every elementary tensor [formula] we have As we have in $ 4, the above relation holds for every [formula] and so for every [formula]. Therefore [formula] is a Bessel vector for [formula]. [formula]
