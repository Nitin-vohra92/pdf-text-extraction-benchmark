Introduction

Over the last decade, the field of cold degenerate gases has been one of the most active areas in physics. The discovery of Bose-Einstein Condensates (BEC) in 1995 (see e.g. [\cite=dgps99] [\cite=mo06]) greatly stimulated research of ultracold dilute Boson-Fermion mixtures. This interest is driven by the desire to understand strongly interacting and strongly correlated systems, with applications in solid-state physics, nuclear physics, astrophysics, quantum computing, and nanotechnologies.

An important property of Bose-Fermi mixtures wherein the fermion component is dominant is that the mixture tends to exhibit essentially three-dimensional character even in a strongly elongated trap. During the last decade, great progress has been achieved in the experimental realization of Bose-Fermi mixtures [\cite=mrr02] [\cite=sfc01], in particular Bose-Fermi mixtures in one-dimensional lattices. Optical lattices provide a powerful tool to manipulate matter waves, in particular solitons. The Pauli exclusion principle results in the extension of the fermion cloud in the transverse direction over distances comparable to the longitudinal dimension of the excitations. It has been shown recently, however, that the quasi-one-dimensional situation can nevertheless be realized in a Bose-Fermi mixture due to strong localization of the bosonic component [\cite=tw00] [\cite=skk06]. With account of the effectiveness of the optical lattice in managing systems of cold atoms, their effect on the dynamics of Bose-Fermi mixtures is of obvious interest. Some of the aspects of this problem have already been explored within the framework of the mean-field approximation. In particular, the dynamics of the Bose-Fermi mixtures were explored from the point of view of designing quantum dots [\cite=s05]. The localized states of Bose-Fermi mixtures with attractive (repulsive) Bose-Fermi interactions are viewed as a matter-wave realization of quantum dots and antidots. The case of Bose-Fermi mixtures in optical lattices is investigated in detail and the existence of gap solitons is shown. In particular, in [\cite=s05] it is obtained that the gap solitons can trap a number of fermionic bound-state levels inside both for repulsive and attractive boson-boson interactions. The time-dependent dynamical mean-field-hydrodynamic model to study the formation of fermionic bright solitons in a trapped degenerate Fermi gas mixed with a Bose-Einstein condensate in a quasi-one-dimensional cigar-shaped geometry is proposed in [\cite=a05]. Similar model is used to study mixing-demixing in a degenerate fermion-fermion mixture in [\cite=a06]. Modulational instability, solitons and periodic waves in a model of quantum degenerate boson-fermion mixtures are obtained in [\cite=bpv07].

Our aim is to derive two new classes of quasi-periodic exact solutions of the time dependent mean field equations of Bose-Fermi mixture in one-dimensional lattice. We also study some limiting cases of these solutions. The paper is organized as follows. In Section [\ref=sec:1] we give the basic equations. Section [\ref=sec:2] is devoted to derivation of the first class quasi-periodic solutions with non-trivial phases. A system of Nf + 1 equations, which reduce quasi-periodic solutions to periodic are derived. In Section [\ref=sec:3] we present second class (type B) nontrivial phase solutions. In Section [\ref=sec:4] we obtain 14 classes of elliptic solutions. Section [\ref=sec:5] is devoted to two special limits, to hyperbolic and trigonometric functions. In Section [\ref=sec:7] preliminary results about the linear stability of solutions are given. Section [\ref=sec:8] summarizes the main conclusions of the paper.

Basic equations

At mean field approximation we consider the following Nf  +  1 coupled equations [\cite=kb04] [\cite=s05] [\cite=bskk06] [\cite=bpv07] where [formula] and [formula] and [formula] are the scattering lengths for s-wave collisions for boson-boson and boson-fermion interactions, respectively. In recent experiments [\cite=mi02] [\cite=gi04] the quantum degenerate mixtures of [formula] and [formula] are studied where [formula] , [formula] and [formula] [formula]. Equations ([\ref=bf1]), ([\ref=bf2]) have been studied numerically in [\cite=kb04]. The formation of localized structures containing bosons and fermions has been reported in the particular case in which the interspecies scattering length [formula] is negative, which is the case of the [formula]K-[formula]Rb mixture. An appropriate class of periodic potentials to model the quasi-1D confinement produced by a standing light wave is given by [\cite=bcdn01] where [formula] denotes the Jacobian elliptic sine function with elliptic modulus 0  ≤  k  ≤  1.

Experimental realization of two-component Bose-Einstein condensates have stimulated considerable attention in general [\cite=mdfmm00] and in particular in the quasi-1D regime [\cite=ba01] [\cite=Deco] when the Gross-Pitaevskii equations for two interacting Bose-Einstein condensates reduce to coupled nonlinear Schrödinger (CNLS) equations with an external potential. In specific cases the two component CNLS equations can be reduced to the Manakov system [\cite=Manakov] with an external potential.

Important role in analyzing these effects was played by the elliptic and periodic solutions of the above-mentioned equations. Such solutions for the one-component nonlinear Schrödinger equation are well known, see [\cite=book] and the numerous references therein. Elliptic solutions for the CNLS and Manakov system were derived in [\cite=pp*99] [\cite=ceek00] [\cite=EilEnoKo].

In the presence of external elliptic potential explicit stationary solutions for NLS were derived in [\cite=bcdn01] [\cite=ckr01] [\cite=bcdkp01]. These results were generalized to the n-component CNLS in [\cite=Deco]. For 2-component CNLS explicit stationary solutions are derived in [\cite=kegks04].

Stationary solutions with non-trivial phases

We restrict our attention to stationary solutions of these CNLS where [formula], κ0, κ0,j, are constant phases, qj and Θ0, Θj(x) are real-valued functions connected by the relation C0,Cj, [formula] being constants of integration. Substituting the ansatz ([\ref=Abf1]), ([\ref=Abf2]) in equations ([\ref=bf1]) and separating the real and imaginary part we get

We seek solutions for q20 and q2j, [formula] as a quadratic function of [formula]: Inserting ([\ref=AbfV1]) in ([\ref=sBFV1]) and equating the coefficients of equal powers of [formula] results in the following relations among the solution parameters ωj, j, Aj and Bj and the characteristic of the optical lattice V0, α and k: where [formula]. Next for convenience we introduce then In order for our results ([\ref=AbfV1]) to be consistent with the parametrization ([\ref=Abf1])-([\ref=Theta]) we must ensure that both q0(x) and Θ0(x) are real-valued, and also qj(x) and Θj(x) are real-valued; this means that C20  ≥  0 and q20(x)  ≥  0 and also C2j  ≥  0 and q2j(x)  ≥  0 (see Table [\ref=tab:1], [formula], [formula]). An elementary analysis shows that with [formula] one of the following conditions must hold

Although our main interest is to analyze periodic solutions, note that the solutions Ψb, Ψfj in ([\ref=bf1]), ([\ref=bf2]) are not always periodic in x. Indeed, let us first calculate explicitly Θ0(x) and Θj(x) by using the well known formula, see e.g. [\cite=as65]: where [formula], ζ, σ are standard Weierstrass functions.

In the case a) we replace v by iv0 and v by ivj, set [formula], [formula] and

[formula]

and rewrite the l.h.s in terms of Jacobi elliptic functions: and for [formula] we have Skipping the details we find the explicit form of and for Θj(x), [formula] we have

These formulae provide an explicit expression for the solutions Ψb, Ψfj with nontrivial phases; note that for real values of v0 Θ0(x), vj Θj(x) are also real. Now we can find the conditions under which Qj(x,t) are periodic. Indeed, from ([\ref=eq:Thet_j]) we can calculate the quantities T0, Tj satisfying: Then Ψb, Ψfj will be periodic in x with periods T0 = 2m0ω  /  α, Tj = 2mjω  /  α if there exist pairs of integers m0, p0, and mj, pj, such that: where ω (and ω') are the half-periods of the Weierstrass functions.

Type B nontrivial phase solutions

For the first time solutions of this type were derived in [\cite=bcdn01] [\cite=ckr01] [\cite=bcdkp01] for the case of nonlinear Schrödinger equation and in [\cite=Deco] for the n-component CNLSE. For Bose-Fermi mixtures solutions of this type are possible

when we have two lattices [formula] and [formula],

when [formula].

We seek the solutions in one of the following forms: In the first case ([\ref=AbfV1B1]) we have We remark that due to relations [formula] we have that all qj of the fermion fields are proportional to q1.

Examples of elliptic solutions

Using the general solution equations ([\ref=A])-([\ref=AC]) we have the following special cases: (these solutions are possible only when we have some restrictions on [formula], [formula], and V0 see the Table [\ref=tab:1])

Suppose that B0 = Bj = 0. Therefore we have For the frequencies ω0 and ωj we have as well as C0  =  Cj = 0.

Let B0 =  - A0 and Bj =  - Aj hold true. Then we have The coefficients A0 and Aj have the same form as ([\ref=A_0]). The frequencies ω0 and ωj now look as follows The constants C0 and Cj are equal to zero again.

B0 =  - A0 / k2 and Bj =  - Aj / k2. In this case we obtain As before C0  =  Cj = 0.

B0 = 0 and Bj =  - Aj. The result reads By analogy with the previous examples the constants A0, Aj, C0 and Cj are given by formulae ([\ref=A_0]) and C0, Cj are all zero.

B0 = 0 and Bj =  - Aj / k2. Thus one gets

Let B0 =  - A0 and Bj = 0. Hence we have

Let B0 =  - A0 and Bj =  - Aj / k2. We obtain

Suppose B0 =  - A0 / k2 and Bj = 0. Then

Let B0 =  - A0 / k2 and Bj =  - Aj. Thus

All these cases when V0 = 0 and j = 2 are derived for the first time in [\cite=bpv07].

Mixed trivial phase solution

When B0 = 0, B1 = 0, B2 =  - A2, Bj =  - Aj / k2, [formula] the solutions obtain the form Using equations ([\ref=A])-([\ref=AC]) we have

Let B0 = B1 = 0 and Bj =  - Aj where [formula]. Therefore the solutions read Then we obtain for frequencies the following results

Suppose B0 =  - A0, B1 = 0, B2 =  - A2 and Bj =  - Aj / k2 where [formula]. The solutions have the form The frequencies are

Let B0 =  - A0, B1 =  - A1 and Bj =  - Aj / k2 for [formula]. Then

Let B0 =  - A0 / k2, B1 =  - A1 and Bj =  - Aj / k2 for [formula]. Hence

Certainly these examples do not exhaust all possible combinations of solutions and it is easy to extend this list.

Vector soliton solutions

Vector bright-bright soliton solutions

When [formula], [formula] and B0 =  - A0, Bj =  - Aj we obtain that the solutions read where A0  ≤  0 as well as Aj  ≤  0. Using equations ([\ref=A])-([\ref=AC]) we have As a consequence of the restrictions on A0 and Aj one can get the following unequalities Vector bright soliton solution when V0 = 0 is derived for the first time in [\cite=bpv07].

Vector dark-dark soliton solutions

When [formula] and B0 = Bj = 0 are satisfied the solutions read The natural restrictions A0  ≥  0 and Aj  ≥  0 lead to For the frequencies ω0 and ωj and the constants C0 and Cj we have

Vector bright-dark soliton solutions

When k  →  1, B0 =  - A0 and Bj = 0, we have The parameters A0 and Aj are given by ([\ref=vsol1_A]). In this case we have the following restrictions

Vector dark-bright soliton solutions

When [formula] and provided that B0 = 0 and Bj =  - Aj the result is By analogy with the previous examples the constants A0, Aj, C0 and Cj are given by formulae ([\ref=vsol1_A]) and ([\ref=vsol1_C]) respectively. The restrictions now are

Vector dark-dark-bright soliton solutions

Let B0 = B1 = 0 and Bj =  - Aj where [formula]. Therefore the solutions read Then we obtain for frequencies the following results These examples are by no means exhaustive.

Nontrivial phase, trigonometric limit

In this section we consider a trap potential of the form [formula], as a model for an optical lattice. Our potential V is similar and differs only with additive constant. When k  →  0, [formula] Using equations ([\ref=A])-([\ref=AC]) again we obtain the following result when (see Table [\ref=tab:2a]) where

This solution is the most important from the physical point of view [\cite=s05].

Linear stability, preliminary results

To analyze linear stability of our initial system of equations we seek solutions in the form and obtain the following linearized equations where The analysis of the latter matrix system is a difficult problem and only numerical simulations are possible. Recently a great progress was achieved for analysis of linear stability of periodic solutions of type ([\ref=Abf1]), ([\ref=Abf2]) (see e.g. [\cite=bcdn01] [\cite=ckr01] [\cite=bcdkp01] [\cite=Deco] [\cite=kegks04] and references therein). Nevertheless the stability analysis is known only for solutions of type ([\ref=Ell1])-([\ref=Ell11]) and solutions with nontrivial phase of type ([\ref=SSol1]) and ([\ref=SSol2]). Linear analysis of soliton solutions is well developed, but it is out scope of the present paper.

Finally we discuss three special cases:

Case I. Let B0 = Bj = 0 then for [formula] and [formula], [formula] we have the following linearized equations:

Case II. Let B0 =  - A0, Bj =  - Aj then for [formula], [formula] we obtain the following linearized equations:

Case III. Let B0 =  - A0 / k2, Bj =  - Aj / k2 therefore the solutions are and we obtain the following linearized equations These cases are by no means exhaustive.

Conclusions

In conclusion, we have considered the mean field model for boson-fermion mixtures in optical lattice. Classes of quasi-periodic, periodic, elliptic solutions, and solitons have been analyzed in detail. These solutions can be used as initial states which can generate localized matter waves (solitons) through the modulational instability mechanism. This important problem is under consideration.
