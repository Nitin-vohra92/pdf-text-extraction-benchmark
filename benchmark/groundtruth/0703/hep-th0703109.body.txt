Generalized Electromagnetic fields in Chiral Medium

Introduction

Physicists were fascinated about magnetic monopoles since its ingenious idea was put forward by Dirac [\cite=key-1] and also by Saha [\cite=key-2]. So many attempts [\cite=key-3] [\cite=key-4] were made for the experimental verification of conclusive existence of magnetic monopoles and after the failure of attempts, the literature [\cite=key-5] [\cite=key-6] [\cite=key-7] turned partially negative casting doubts on the existence of such particles. The work of the Schwinger [\cite=key-8] was the first exception to the argument against the existence of monopoles. At the same time so many paradoxes were related to the theory of pure Abelian monopoles, as Dirac's veto, wrong spin-statistics connection [\cite=key-9] and many others [\cite=key-10] [\cite=key-11]. Several problems were soon resolved by the invention of dyons [\cite=key-12] [\cite=key-13] [\cite=key-14] [\cite=key-15] particles carrying simultaneous existence of electric and magnetic charges. Fresh interest in this subject was enhanced by the idea given by t'Hooft [\cite=key-16] and Polyakov [\cite=key-17] showing that monopoles are the intrinsic parts of grand unified theories. The Dirac monopole is an elementary particle but the t'Hooft-Polyakov monopole [\cite=key-16] [\cite=key-17] is a complicated extended object having a definite mass and finite size inside of which massive fields play a role in providing a smooth structure and outside it they vanish rapidly leaving the field configuration identical to Abelian Dirac monopole. Julia and Zee [\cite=key-18] have extended the idea of t' Hooft [\cite=key-16] and Polyakov [\cite=key-17] to construct the classical solutions for non-Abelian dyon. On the other hand, Prasad and Sommerfield [\cite=key-19] [\cite=key-20] have derived the analytic stable solutions for the non-Abelian monopoles and dyons of finite mass by keeping the symmetry of vacuum broken but letting the self-interaction of Higgs field approaching zero. Such solutions, satisfying Bogomolnys condition [\cite=key-21] are described as Bogomolny-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) monopoles. Kranchenko and coauthors [\cite=key-22] [\cite=key-23] discussed the Maxwell's equations in homogenous media and developed [\cite=key-24] the quaternionic reformulation of the time-dependent Maxwell's equations along with the classical solution of a moving source i.e. electron. They have also demonstrated [\cite=key-25] the elctromagnetic fields in chiral media along with their quaternionic reformulation in a simple and consistent manner. Recently, we have extended the work of Kranchenko [\cite=key-22] [\cite=key-23] and reformulated [\cite=key-26] the Maxwell's -Dirac equation in homogenous (isotropic) medium and their quaternionic forms in a unique and consistent way [\cite=key-27]. We have also described [\cite=key-28] the time-harmonic Maxwell's equations for generalized fields of dyons in a consistent manner. Keeping these facts in mind, in this paper, we have derived the generalized theory of Maxwell's -Dirac equation in presence of electric and magnetic charges in chiral and homogenous (isotropic) medium. The quaternion analysis of these time dependent Maxwell's equations in presence of electric and magnetic charges are obtained in unique, simpler and consistent manner. It has been shown that the quantum equations and equation of motion represent the dynamics of electric charge similar to the theory described by Kranchenko [\cite=key-22] [\cite=key-23] in the absence of magnetic monopole or vice versa.

Generalized Maxwell's Equation of Dyons in Isotropic Medium

Considering the existence of magnetic monopoles, Dirac [\cite=key-1] generalized the Maxwell's field equations in homogenous (isotropic) medium in the following manner [\cite=key-26];

where ρe and ρm are respectively the electric and magnetic charge densities while [formula] and [formula] are the corresponding current densities, [formula] is electric induction vector, [formula] is electric field, [formula] is magnetic field andεr and μr are defined respectively as relative permitivity and permeability in electric and magnetic fields.

The electric and magnetic fields of dyons are expresed in homogenous medium in terms of two potentials as,

where {Vμ} is the generalised four-potential of dyons in homogenous medium and is defined as

[formula]

i.e.

Using equation ([\ref=eq:9]) we introduce a new parameter[formula] (i.e. the field current) as

where [formula]is the D'Alembertian operator.

In terms of components of complex potential the Maxell's -Dirac equations are written as

[formula]

We may thus write the tensorial form of generalized Maxwell's -Dirac equations of dyons in homogenous medium as

Operating first equation of ([\ref=eq:26]) to equation ([\ref=eq:27]) and using equation ([\ref=eq:21] ), we get

[formula]

Similarly we operate first equation of ([\ref=eq:26]) to equation ([\ref=eq:29]) and using equation ([\ref=eq:21] ) , we get

[formula]

Equations ([\ref=eq:32]) and ([\ref=eq:33] ) are the quaternion forms of field equations associated respectivly with the generalized potential and currents of dyons in homogeneous isotropic medium. These equations are invariant under quaternion transformations as well as with homogeneous Lorentz transformations. Instead of four sets of differential equations of fileld equations we may write only one set of quaternion differential equations in compact ,simple and consistent manner. We may reinterpret our results as that the algebra over the field of real numbers corresponds four sets of differential equations given by equation ([\ref=eq:1] ), the algebra over the field of complex numbers corresponds to two sets of differential equations given by equation ([\ref=eq:9]-[\ref=eq:10] ) while the algebra over the field of quaternion variables corresponds only to one set of differential equations given by equation ([\ref=eq:32] ). As such equations ([\ref=eq:32]) and ([\ref=eq:33] ) are the quaternion forms of differential equations ( [\ref=eq:9]-[\ref=eq:10]and [\ref=eq:13] ) and may be visualzed as the quaternion reformulation of generalized potential and current of dyons in isotropic homogeneous medium in compact, simpler and cosistent manner.

Generalized Electromagnetic Fields in Chiral Media

Let us consider the generalized Maxwell's equations for dyons in homogenous (isotropic) medium as

[formula]

In the above equation we have taken the electric field [formula] and magnetic field [formula] is time harmonic. Considering electric and magnetic field as under [\cite=key-28]

where ε,μ, and β are premittivity, permeability and chiral parameter respectively. If the medium is isotropic, the cartesian field components are given by

[formula]

Applying the condition given by ([\ref=eq:36]) into third and fourth equation of equation ([\ref=eq:35]) we get,

Let us consider the following purely vectorial biquaternionic functions as,

[formula]

Operating the quaternionic differential operator D on equation ([\ref=eq:41]), we get

[formula]

Thus the complex quaternionic function [formula] satisfies the following equation

[formula]

By analogy of equation ([\ref=eq:44]), we obtain the equation for [formula] as,

[formula]

On using equation ([\ref=eq:34]) and equation ([\ref=eq:40]), the continuity equation is described in the following manner,

[formula]

Introducing the notations

[formula]

and using equations ([\ref=eq:46]) and ([\ref=eq:47]), we may write the differential equations ([\ref=eq:44] )and ([\ref=eq:45] ) in the folowing forms i.e.,

[formula]

In the above equations if we put β = 0, we get the quaternionic form of the generalized Maxwell's equation of dyons in the absence of chiral medium. In general the wave numbers α1and α2 are different and physically characterize the propogation of waves of opposing circular polarizations.

Discussion

In the fore going analysis, the equations ([\ref=eq:36]) showing the dependence of the electric displacement vector and the magnetic induction vector on the electric and magnetic fields, do not take into account the chirality of the medium. Instead, they depend upon only on the conductivity, electric permittivity and magnetic permeability of the medium. Chirality is described as the asymmetry in the molecular structure where a molecule is chiral if it cannot be superimposed onto its mirror image. Presence of chirality results in the rotation of electromagnetic fields and its observable, particular in the microwave range even for the case of a particle consisting electric and magnetic charges (i.e. a dyon). Such experimental observations may be used in physical chemistry to characterize molecular structure. The present theory of generalized electrodynamics of dyons leads the connection between the mechanical parameters with the chirality and dilectric properties of the brain tissue considered as a bioplasama . Hence the proposal for dyonic bioplasama is being considered. Our theory reduces to the theories described earlier [\cite=key-22] [\cite=key-23] [\cite=key-24] [\cite=key-25] [\cite=key-29] [\cite=key-30] [\cite=key-31] [\cite=key-32] for the case of elecrtic charge in the absence of magnetic mponopole on dyon and cosequently the theories of pure monopole be described from duality in the absence of electric charge on dyons.
