Introduction

The crossed product of a C*-algebra A by an automorphism δ:A  →  A is defined as a universal C*-algebra generated by a copy of A and a unitary element U satisfying the relations

[formula]

On one hand, algebras arising in this way (or their versions adapted to actions of groups of automorphisms) are very well understood and became a part of a C*-folklore [\cite=Kadison], [\cite=Pedersen]. On the other hand, it is very symptomatic that, even though the first attempts on generalizing this kind of constructions to endomorphisms go back to 1970s, articles introducing different definitions of the related object appear almost continuously until the present-day, see, for example, [\cite=CK], [\cite=Paschke], [\cite=Stacey], [\cite=Murphy], [\cite=exel1], [\cite=exel2], [\cite=kwa], [\cite=Ant-Bakht-Leb]. This phenomenon is caused by very fundamental problems one has to face when dealing with crossed products by endomorphisms. Namely, one has to answer the following questions:

What relations should the element U satisfy?

What should be used in place of δ- 1?

It is important that in spite of the substantial freedom of choice (in answering the foregoing questions), all the above listed papers do however have a certain nontrivial intersection. They mostly agree, and simultaneously boast their greatest successes, in the case when dynamics is implemented by monomorphisms with a hereditary range. In view of the recent articles [\cite=Bakht-Leb], [\cite=Ant-Bakht-Leb], [\cite=kwa3], this coincidence is completely understood. It is shown in [\cite=Bakht-Leb] that in the case of monomorphism with hereditary range there exists a unique non-degenerate transfer operator δ* for (A,δ), called by authors of [\cite=Bakht-Leb] a complete transfer operator, and the theory goes smooth with δ* as it takes over the role classically played by δ- 1. The C*-dynamical systems of this sort will be called partially reversible.

If the pair (A,δ) is of the above described type then A is called a coefficient algebra. This notion was introduced in [\cite=Leb-Odz] where its investigation and relation to the extensions of C*-algebras by partial isometries was clarified. Further in [\cite=Bakht-Leb] a certain criterion for a C*-algebra to be a coefficient algebra associated with a given endomorphism was obtained. On the base of the results of these papers one naturally arrives at the construction of a certain crossed product which was implemented in [\cite=Ant-Bakht-Leb]. It was also observed in [\cite=Ant-Bakht-Leb] that in the most natural situations the coefficient algebras arise as a result of a certain extension procedure on the initial C*-algebra. Since the crossed product is (should be) an extension of the initial C*-algebra one can consider the construction of an appropriate coefficient algebra as one of the most important intermediate steps in the procedure of construction of the crossed product itself. Thus one arrives at the next natural problem: can we extend a C*-dynamical system associated with an arbitrary endomorphism to a partially reversible C*-dynamical system? In the commutative C*-algebra situation the corresponding procedure and the explicit description of maximal ideals of the arising C*-algebra is given in [\cite=maxid]. On the base of this construction the general construction of the crossed product associated to an arbitrary endomorphism of a commutative C*-algebra is presented in [\cite=kwa]. Further the general construction of an extension of a C*-dynamical system associated with an arbitrary endomorphism to a partially reversible C*-dynamical system is worked out in [\cite=kwa3], [\cite=kwa4]. Therefore the mentioned results of [\cite=Bakht-Leb], [\cite=Ant-Bakht-Leb], [\cite=kwa3], [\cite=kwa4], give us the key to construct a general crossed product starting from a C*-dynamical system associated with an arbitrary endomorphism, and this is the theme of the present article, see also Remark [\ref=remark_something].

The main novelty here is

the explicit description of the crossed product based on the worked out matrix calculus presented in Section [\ref=2],

and an observation of (in a way unexpected) phenomena that

in general the universal construction of the crossed product depends not only on the algebra A and an endomorphism δ one starts with but also on the choice of an ( arbitrary) singled out ideal J orthogonal to the kernel of δ (see Section [\ref=1]).

So in fact we have a variety of crossed products depending on J.

The paper is organized as follows.

In the first section we recall a notion of covariant representation of C*-dynamical system which appear in a similar or identical form, for instance, in [\cite=kwa4], [\cite=Leb-Odz], [\cite=kwa], [\cite=exel2], [\cite=Murphy], [\cite=Stacey]. We split a class of covariant representation into subclasses according to a certain ideal they determine, and explain a role this distinction plays in the present article. Section 2 contains a matrix calculus which describes an algebraic structure of the crossed product and in Section 3 we calculate the appropriate norms. Gathering the facts from the previous sections we define crossed product in Section 4. In the final section we include theorems concerning representations of the newly defined object.

Covariant representations and orthogonal ideals

In this section we discuss interrelations between covariant representations and orthogonal ideals. In particular, we indicate (in Remark [\ref=remark_something]) a definition of the crossed product.

Let (A,δ) be a pair consisting of a C*-algebra A, containing an identity and an endomorphism δ:A  →  A. Throughout the paper the pair (A,δ) will be called a C*-dynamical system.

Let (A,δ) be a C*-dynamical system. A triple (π,U,H) consisting of a non-degenerate faithful representation π:A  →  B(H) on a Hilbert space H and a partial isometry U∈B(H) satisfying

[formula]

will be called a covariant representation of (A,δ).

The first named author described in [\cite=kwa4] a procedure of extending any C*-dynamical system (A,δ) up to a system (A+,δ+) with a property that a kernel of δ+ is unital. Moreover, the resulting system (A+,δ+) is in a sense the smallest extension of (A,δ) possessing that property, see [\cite=kwa4]. Let us now slightly generalize this construction, which will be essential for our future purposes. Let (A,δ) be a C*-dynamical system and denote by I the kernel of δ:A  →  A. We shall say that an ideal J in A is orthogonal to I if

[formula]

There exists the biggest ideal orthogonal to I (in the sense that it contains all other orthogonal ideals to I) and we shall denote it by [formula]. This ideal could be defined explicitly. Namely if we let

[formula]

then we have

[formula]

Alternative explicit definition of [formula] can be found in [\cite=kwa4]. Our construction will depend on the choice of an ideal orthogonal to I. Let us single out a certain ideal J which is orthogonal to I in A, that is

[formula]

By AJ we denote the direct sum of quotient algebras

[formula]

and we set δJ:AJ  →  AJ by the formula

[formula]

Routine verification shows that

[formula]

Since I = Kerδ it follows that an element δ(a) does not depend on the choice of a representative of a + I and so the mapping δJ is well defined. Clearly, δJ is an endomorphism and its kernel is unital with the unit of the form [formula]. Moreover, the C*-algebra A embeds into C*-algebra AJ via

[formula]

Since [formula] this mapping is injective and we shall treat A as the corresponding subalgebra of AJ. Under this identification δJ is an extension of δ. The main motivation of the preceding construction is the following statement.

Let (π,U,H) be a covariant representation of (A,δ) and let

[formula]

Then I is the kernel of δ and J is an ideal orthogonal to I. Moreover, if (AJ,δJ) is the extension of (A,δ) constructed above, then π uniquely extends to the isomorphism [formula] such that [formula] is a covariant representation of (AJ,δJ). Namely [formula] is given by

[formula]

Observe that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Therefore the mappings

[formula]

[formula]

establish an isomorphism [formula] Thus

[formula]

Which means that I is the kernel of δ.

It is clear that J is an ideal orthogonal to I. If [formula] is onto and [formula] is a covariant representation of (AJ,δJ) then by [\cite=kwa4] we have

[formula]

Thus [formula] is of the form [\eqref=extension_of_pi_to_J-algebra]. Conversely, formula [\eqref=extension_of_pi_to_J-algebra] defines an isomorphism which follows from the definitions of I and J. It is readily checked that [formula] is a covariant representation of (AJ,δJ).

The larger ideal J is the smaller AJ is. Namely, since KerδJ  =  (0,  A / J) (recall ([\ref=kerd_J])) it follows that as J varies from {0} to [formula] the kernel of δJ varies from (0,  A) to [formula]. On the other hand, in view of ([\ref=d_J]) and ([\ref=A_in]), the image of δJ is always isomorphic to A / I (the first summand of AJ) and thereby it does not depend on the choice of J. The case when [formula] was considered in [\cite=kwa4], see discussion below.

Proposition [\ref=motivation_prop] makes it natural to introduce the following definition.

Let (π,U,H) be a covariant representation (π,U,H) of (A,δ) and J an ideal in A orthogonal to kernel of δ. If (π,U,H) and J are combined with each other via equality

[formula]

then we shall say that (π,U,H) is a covariant representation associated with the ideal J and also that J is the ideal associated to covariant representation (π,U,H).

We stress that in view of Proposition [\ref=motivation_prop] and results of [\cite=kwa4] and [\cite=Ant-Bakht-Leb] one could proceed to defining crossed product associated with an ideal J, right away. Namely, if we fix an ideal J orthogonal to kernel of δ then the algebra

[formula]

does not depend on the choice of a covariant representation (π,U,H) (as long as it is associated with J). Furthermore, it was shown in [\cite=kwa4] that the algebra

[formula]

can be described in terms of the system (AJ,δJ), and therefore it also does not depend on the choice of (π,U,H). Obviously we have

[formula]

which means that B is a coefficient algebra for C*(π(A),U) and the C*-dynamical system on B, with dynamics implemented by U, is partially reversible. Thus we can apply the crossed product elaborated in [\cite=Ant-Bakht-Leb] to the extended partially reversible system on B (which is uniquely determined by (A,δ) and J). Summing up, the construction of crossed product involve essentially two steps: extending an irreversible system on A up to a partially reversible system on B, and then attaching the crossed product to the extended system. Such an approach was explored in the commutative case in [\cite=kwa]. In contrast to this two (or even three) step construction, in the present paper, however, we propose a direct approach which provides us with a one more interesting, integral point of view.

In view of Proposition [\ref=motivation_prop] and [\cite=kwa4], cf. above remark, we have the following highly non-trivial statement.

Let J be an arbitrary ideal in A having zero intersection with the kernel of δ. There exists a covariant representation associated with the ideal J.

The first named author introduced in [\cite=kwa4] a notion of a strict covariant representation where by a strict covariant representation of (A,δ) he meant a covariant representation (π,U,H) such that

[formula]

where {μλ}λ∈Λ is an approximate unit in the kernel I of δ. It follows that if (π,U,H) satisfies [\eqref=stricct_covariant_eqation] it is associated with the ideal [formula], cf. [\cite=kwa4]. However the converse statement is not true.

Let A = c be the algebra of all converging sequences (numbered by 1,2,3,4,...) and let δ be an endomorphism of A which maps a sequence (a(1),a(2),...) onto a constant one (a(  ∞  ),a(  ∞  ),...) where a(  ∞  ) =  lim k  →    ∞a(k). Then the kernel I = c0 of δ is the algebra of all sequences converging to zero. Let [formula] and define π:A  →  L(H) by

[formula]

Let us consider the family of co-isometries Un∈L(H), n = 0,1,2,..., where

[formula]

Then for every n the triple (π,Un,H) is a covariant representations associated with [formula]. However, (π,Un,H) satisfies [\eqref=stricct_covariant_eqation] if and only if n = 0.

Matrix calculus for covariance algebras

In this section we describe a certain matrix calculus that will be an algebraic framework for constructing our principal object -- the crossed product.

We denote by M(A) the set of infinite matrices [formula] with entries in A indexed by pairs of natural numbers such that the coefficients aij are of the form

[formula]

and there is at most finite number of aij which are non-zero. We will take advantage of this standard matrix notation when defining operations on M(A) and investigating a natural homomorphism from M(A) to the covariance algebras generated by covariant representations. However, when investigating norm of elements in covariance algebras, it more handy to index the entries of an element in M(A) by a pair consisting of a natural number and an integer. Hence we shall paralellely use two notations concerning matrices in M(A). Namely, we presume the following identifications

[formula]

under which we have two equivalent matrix presentations

[formula]

The use of one of this conventions will always be clear from the context. We define the addition, multiplication by scalar, and involution on M(A) in a natural manner. Namely, let [formula] and [formula]. We put Moreover, we introduce a convolution multiplication "[formula]" on M(A), which is a reflection of the operator multiplication in covariance algebras. We set

[formula]

where ·   is the standard multiplication of matrices and mapping Λ:M(A)  →  M(A) is defined to act as follows: Λ(a)ij  =  δ(ai - 1,j - 1), for i,j > 1, and Λ(a)ij = 0 otherwise, that is Λ assumes the following shape

[formula]

The set M(A) with operations [\eqref=add1], [\eqref=mulscal1], [\eqref=invol1], [\eqref=star1] becomes an algebra with involution.

The only thing we show is the associativity of the multiplication [\eqref=star1], the rest is straightforward. For that purpose we note that Λ preserves the standard matrix multiplication and thus we have

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

We embed A into M(A) by identifying element a∈A with a matrix [formula] where a00 = a and amn = 0 if (m,n)  ≠  (0,0). We also define a partial isometry [formula] in M(A) such that u01  =  δ(1) and umn = 0 if (m,n)  ≠  (0,1). In other words, we adopt the following notation

[formula]

One can easily check that the *-algebra M(A) is generated by u and A. Furthermore, for every a∈A we have

[formula]

Let (π,U,H) be a covariant representation of (A,δ). Then there exists a unique *-homomorphism Ψ(π,U) from M(A) onto a *-algebra C*0(π(A),U) generated by π(A) and U, such that

[formula]

Moreover, Ψ(π,U) is given by the formula

[formula]

and thus [formula].

It is clear that Ψ(π,U) has to satisfy form [\eqref=Psi_form_eq]. Thus it is enough to check that Ψ(π,U) is a *-homomorphism, and in fact we only need to show that Ψ(π,U) is multiplicative as the rest is obvious. For that purpose let us fix two matrices [formula]. We shall examine the product

[formula]

Depending on the relationship between r and s we have two cases. Using the formulas obtained in 1) and 2) we have

[formula]

[formula]

and the proof is complete.

We now examine the structure of M(A). We shall say that a matrix [formula] in M(A) is k-diagonal, where k is an integer, if it satisfies the condition

[formula]

In other words k-diagonal matrix is the one of the form

The linear space consisting of all k-diagonal matrices will be denoted by Mk. These will correspond to spectral subspaces.

The spaces Mk define a [formula]-gradated algebra structure on M(A). Namely

[formula]

and for every k, [formula] we have the following relations

[formula]

In particular, M0 is a *-algebra, [formula] is a self-adjoint two sided ideal in M0. Moreover

[formula]

Relations M*k  =  M- k, [formula] and [formula] can be checked by means of an elementary matrix calculus. Using these relations we get

[formula]

[formula]

and thus [formula] is an ideal in M0. Since the product of two ideals is equal to their intersection we have [formula]. In order to see that [formula] one readily checks that the identity 1k in [formula] satisfies 1ka = a for every a∈Mk.

Proposition [\ref=**] indicates in particular that M0 may be regarded as a coefficient algebra for M(A). This will be showed explicitly in Proposition [\ref=nie_dam_rady_umre].

Let (π,U,H) be covariant representation of (A,δ) and let Bk  =  Ψ(π,U)(Mk) be the linear space consisting of the elements of the form

[formula]

Then for every k and [formula] we have the following relations

[formula]

In particular, B0 is a C*-algebra, BkB*k is a self-adjoint two sided ideal in B0 and

[formula]

The importance of B0 was observed in [\cite=Leb-Odz] and is clarified by the next proposition, see [\cite=Leb-Odz].

Let (π,U,H) be covariant representation of (A,δ) and adopt the notation from Theorem [\ref=dense_subalgera_structure_prop] and Corollary [\ref=wniosek_o_spektralnych_podprzestrzeniach]. Every element a∈C*0(π(A),U) can be presented in the form

[formula]

where a- k∈B0π(δk(1)), ak∈π(δk(1))B0, [formula], and only finite number of these coefficients are non-zero.

We shall now formulate a similar result concerning M(A). For each [formula] we define a mapping Nk:M(A)  →  M0, [formula], that carries a k-diagonal onto a 0-diagonal and delete all the remaining ones. Namely, for a  =  {a(k)n} we set

[formula]

One readily checks that for k  ≥  0 we have [formula], [formula]. Thus we get that the algebra M0 consists of elements that play the role of Fourier coefficients in M(A).

Every element a of M(A) is uniquely presented in the form

[formula]

where u is given by ([\ref=notation_stupid]) and [formula], [formula], [formula], and only finite number of these coefficients is non-zero. Namely, ak = Nk(a) for [formula].

Norm evaluation of elements in C*0(π(A),U)

In this section we gather a number of technical results concerning norm evaluation of elements in C*0(π(A),U). We shall make use of these results in the subsequent sections.

The mappings Nk:Mk  →  M0 factors through Φ(π,U) to mappings Nk:Bk  →  B0.

Let (π,U,H) be a covariant representation of (A,δ) and let [formula]. Then the norm [formula] of an element a∈Bk corresponding to the matrix [formula] in Mk is given by

[formula]

In particular the mapping Nk:Bk  →  B0 given by

[formula]

is a well defined linear isometry establishing the following isometric isomorphisms

[formula]

Let us assume that k  ≥  0. Let N be such that a(k)m = 0 for m > N. Then, similarly as it was done in [\cite=kwa4], one checks that defining

[formula]

we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

Since Uk is a partial isometry, fomulae [\eqref=postac_coefficientowa] and [\eqref=coefficients_warunki1] imply the following equalities

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

where the final equality follows from [\eqref=coefficients_warunki1] and the fact that U* jUj - U* j + 1Uj + 1, j = 0,..,N, and U* N + 1UN + 1 are pairwise orthogonal projections lying in π(A)', cf. [\cite=kwa4]. This proves the case when k  ≥  0. In the case of negative k one may apply the part of proposition proved above to the adjoint a* of the element a and thus the hypotheses follows.

We denote by

[formula]

the usual distance of an element a from the set K. The definition of an ideal associated to a covariant representation (Definition [\ref=kowariant_rep_defn_2]) and a known fact expressing quotient norms in terms of projections, see for instance, [\cite=Kadison], gives us the following

If (π,U,H) is a covariant representation of (A,δ) associated with an ideal J and I denotes the kernel of δ, then the norm of an element a∈Bk corresponding to a matrix [formula] in Mk is given by

[formula]

In particular, the spaces Bk, [formula] do not depend on the choice of covariant representation associated with a fixed ideal J orthogonal to I.

We showed in Proposition [\ref=proposition_for_k-diagonals] that for an arbitrary covariant representation (π,U,H), the mappings Nk factor through to the mappings Nk acting on spaces Bk, in general however, Nk:M(A)  →  B0 do not factor through Ψ(π,U) to the mappings acting on the algebra C*0(π(A),U). In fact, it is the case iff the covariant representation (π,U,H) satisfies a certain property we are just about to introduce.

We shall say that a covariant representation (π,U,H) of (A,δ) possesses the property ( * ) if for any a∈C*0(π(A),U) given by a matrix [formula] the inequality

[formula]

holds. In view of Corollary [\ref=corollary_with_distance] the above equality could be equivalently stated in the form

[formula]

where (π,U,H) is associated with an ideal J and I is the kernel of δ.

The next result, see [\cite=Leb-Odz], indicates that under the fulfillment of property (*) elements of B0 play the role of 'Fourier' coefficients in the algebra C*0(π(A),U).

Let (π,U,H) be covariant representation possessing the property ( * ) then the mappings Nk:C*0(π(A),U)  →  B0, [formula], given by formulae

[formula]

where [formula], are well defined contractions and thus they extend uniquely to bounded operators on C*(π(A),U). In particular, every element a∈C*0(π(A),U) can be uniquely presented in the form

[formula]

where a- k∈B0π(δk(1)), ak∈π(δk(1))B0, [formula], namely, ak  =  Nk(a), [formula].

Let us also recall [\cite=Leb-Odz].

If (π,U,H) possess the property ( * ), then for any element a in C*0(π(A),U) we have

[formula]

where N0 is the mapping defined by [\eqref=rzuty_na_coefficienty].

Using the above results one sees that in the presence of property ( * ) the norm of an element a∈C*0(π(A),U) may be calculated only in terms of the elements of A. Indeed, as [formula] belongs to B0 one can apply Corollary [\ref=corollary_with_distance] to calculate [formula] in terms of the matrix from M(A) corresponding to a. However in practice, the calculation of the matrix corresponding to the element (aa*)2k starting from a, see formula [\eqref=star1], seems to be an extremely difficult task.

Crossed product

Now we proceed to the description of the goal (the main object) of the article.

The set M(A) with operations [\eqref=add1], [\eqref=mulscal1], [\eqref=invol1], [\eqref=star1] is an algebra with involution. We define a seminorm on M(A) that will depend on the choice of an orthogonal ideal. Let J be a fixed ideal in A having zero intersection with kernel of δ. Let

[formula]

where [formula].

The function [formula] defined above is a seminorm on M(A) which is *-invariant and submulitplicative.

Let (π,U,H) be an arbitrary covariant representation of (|A,δ) associated with J. Such representation does exist by Theorem [\ref=existance_theorem]. Then in view of Corollary [\ref=corollary_with_distance] for every a∈Mk, [formula], we have

[formula]

where Φ(π,U):M(A)  →  L(H) is the *-homomorphism defined in Proposition [\ref=dense_subalgebra_structure_prop]. Using the fact that every element a∈M(A) can be presented in the form [formula] where a(k)∈Mk one easily sees that [formula] is *-invariant seminorm. To show that it is submultiplicative take [formula] and [formula] such that a(k),b(k)∈Mk. Then

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Let (A,δ) be a C*-dynamical system and J an ideal in A having a zero intersection with the kernel of δ. Let

[formula]

be the enveloping C*-algebra of the quotient *-algebra [formula]. The C*-algebra C*(A,δ,J) will be called a crossed product of A by δ associated with J.

Regardless of J, composing the quotient map with natural embedding of A into M(A) one has an embedding of A into C*(A,δ,J). Moreover, denoting by û an element of C*(A,δ,J) corresponding to u∈M(A) (see ([\ref=notation_stupid])), one sees that C*(A,δ,J) is generated by A and û.

Isomorphism theorem

Once a universal object (the crossed product) is defined it is reasonable to have its faithful representation. This section is devoted to the description of the properties of such representations.

Let J be an ideal in A having a zero intersection with the kernel I of δ and let (πi,Ui,Hi), i = 1,2, be covariant representations of (A,δ) associated with J and possessing the property ( * ). Then the relations

[formula]

gives rise to the isomorphism between the C*-algebras C*(π1(A),U1) and C*(π2(A),U2).

Let B0,i be a *-algebra consisting of elements of the form [formula], i = 1,2. In view of Corollary [\ref=corollary_with_distance], Φ extends to the isometric isomorphism from B0,1 onto B0,2. Moreover, we have

[formula]

Hence the assumptions of [\cite=Leb-Odz] are satisfied and the hypotheses follows.

If (π,U,H) possess property ( * ), then we have the action α of the group S1 on C*(π(A),U) by authomorphisms given by

[formula]

Moreover the spaces [formula] are the spectral subspaces corresponding to this action, that is we have

[formula]

In particular, the C*-algebra [formula] is the fixed point algebra for α.

Let (π,U,H) be associated with J and let z∈S1. It is clear that (π,zU,H) is also a covariant representation of (A,δ) associated with J and (π,zU,H) possess property ( * ). Hence by using Theorem [\ref=isomorphiasm_theorem], αz extends to the isomorphism of C*(π(A),U) = C*(π(A),zU). The remaining part of the statement is obvious.

The next theorem is an immediate corollary of the previous statements and [\cite=Leb-Odz]. It is another manifestation of the fact that the elements Nk(a), [formula], should be considered as Fourier coefficients for a∈C*(π(A),U).

Let (π,U,H) possess property ( * ) and let

a∈C*(π(A),U)

Then the following conditions are equivalent:

a = 0;

Nk(a) = 0,  [formula]

N0(a*a) = 0.

The results presented above give us a possibility to write out a criterion for the representation of the crossed product to be faithful.

If (π,U,H), is covariant representations of (A,δ) associated with J, then relations

[formula]

determines in unique way an epimorphism π  ×  U:C*(A,δ,J)  →  C*(A,U). Moreover π  ×  U is an isomorphism iff (π,U,H) possesses property ( * )
