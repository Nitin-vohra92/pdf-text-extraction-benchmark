Schwarzschild or Kerr solution in 3-dim space and N-dim time

Rotations in time plane

In paper [\cite=KW] authors obtained spherically symmetric solution for metric for 2-dim time and 3-dim space in frames of Kaluza theoretic approach For interval they obtained

[formula]

where

[formula]

Here u and t are time coordinates (speed of light c  =  1) and R,J,C and P are constants satisfying relations

[formula]

Substituting [formula] (where square root takes any of two signs) in ([\ref=1]) one obtains

[formula]

Consider rotation in time plane

[formula]

Metric ([\ref=4]) preserves its form under rotation ([\ref=5]) and ([\ref=6]) being provided with tilde quantities

[formula]

Note that under rotation ([\ref=7]) ([\ref=8])

[formula]

From ([\ref=3]) it follows

[formula]

In particular taking

[formula]

one obtains for interval

[formula]

and in ([\ref=12]) one recognizes Schwarzschild solution in 4-dim spacetime with cylinderical extension on 2-nd time dimension which is also solution of Einstein equations in Ricci-flat 5-dim spacetime One may interpret worldline corresponding to {ũ;r;θ;φ}  =  constant as one of uncharged black hole and rotation inverse to ([\ref=5]) ([\ref=6]) corresponds to situation when black hole has momentum along both time coordinates t and u which in Kaluza theory is adequate to motion of charged object In other words if one observer (frame of reference t̃;ũ;ro;θo;φo) sees uncharged black hole then another observer (frame of reference t;u;ro;θo;φo) sees same object as electrically charged These observations suggest insight for construction of analogous solution in case of N-dim of time volume

Schwarzschild solution for N-dim time

One may show that generalizing solution ([\ref=1]) on N-dim time one obtains following expression for interval

[formula]

Here {uk} k  =  1...N are time coordinates; δik  =   diag(1,1,...,1) is unit matrix N  ×  N  ; [formula] ([formula]) are constants as well as M Really consider orthogonal transformation of time coordinates uk  ; ui  =  δikuk

[formula]

here

[formula]

Taking

[formula]

and using ([\ref=15]) one obtains for interval

[formula]

Evidently ([\ref=17]) is solution of Einstein equations hence ([\ref=13]) is solution as well

Kerr solution for N-dim time volume

Kerr solution in covariant and contravariant components [\cite=Landau] is

[formula]

Here

[formula]

Take cylinderical extension of ([\ref=1-1]) on N-dim time (ũ1...ũN) ([formula]) which is also solution of Ricci-flat Einstein equations

[formula]

Consider rotation ([\ref=14]) ([\ref=15]) in time volume according to which dũl  =  Ω  lkduk Then interval ([\ref=18]) may be rewritten as follows

[formula]

Here δkl  =   diag(1,1,...,1) is unit matrix N  ×  N Solution ([\ref=19]) corresponds to charged rotating black hole

Conclusion

In that work I have found easy way to generalize some of solutions of Einstein GRT on N-time volume
