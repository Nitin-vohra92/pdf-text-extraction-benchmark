Introduction to black holes

The laws of black hole mechanics

The laws of black hole mechanics [\cite=BCH:73] imply that black hole solutions of classical gravity are subject to relations which are formally equivalent to the laws of thermodynamics. The zeroth law states that the so-called surface gravity κS of a stationary black hole is constant over the event horizon,

[formula]

The surface gravity of a stationary black hole is the acceleration of a static observer at the horizon, as measured by an observer at infinity. The first law,

[formula]

relates a change of the mass M of a stationary black hole to changes of the area A, the angular momentum J and the electric charge q. The parameters multiplying the variations are the surface gravity κS, the angular velocity at the horizon ω, and the electrostatic potential at the horizon φ. The second law,

[formula]

states that the total area of event horizons is non-decreasing. Finally, the third law states that the extremal limit κS  =  0 cannot be reached in finite time by any physical process.

The laws suggest to identify surface gravity with temperature and area with entropy,

[formula]

In classical physics it does not make sense to assign a finite temperature to a black hole, because it cannot emit radiation. However, once quantum effects are taken into account a black hole of surface gravity κS is found to have the (Hawking) temperature [\cite=Haw]

[formula]

which fixes

[formula]

We will come back to this later, and for the time being we focus on the assumptions underlying the derivation of the laws of black hole mechanics. The laws are statements about solutions of the field equations, and in the original proofs the Einstein equations are used explicitly. The behaviour of matter is controlled by imposing a suitable energy condition. While the zeroth and first law refer to stationary black holes, the second law allows processes where black holes collide and merge. To have control over the time evolution one needs to impose (in addition to the field equations and an energy condition), that the space-time is 'asymptotically predictable'.

It turns out that the zeroth and first law do not depend on details of the field equations. They can be proved for any reparametrization invariant action, provided one makes the following assumptions: (i) the field equations admit stationary black hole solutions, which are either static, or axisymmetric and t - φ reflection symmetric, (ii) the event horizon is a Killing horizon, and, (iii) the space-time is globally hyperbolic [\cite=Wald:93] [\cite=RacWal:95]. Let us explain these conditions in more detail. In the following the only restriction imposed on the action is that it is reparametrization invariant. In particular, the action might contain higher derivative and especially higher curvature terms, which are expected to be present in quantum-effective actions. Concerning condition (i): evidently, if the action is restricted by nothing but general covariance, it is not clear that it admits black hole solutions, which therefore needs to be postulated. Moreover, the proofs of the zeroth and first law rely on symmetry properties, which in Einstein gravity follow from the field equations, but need to be postulated when working in a more general setting. Recall that a space-time is called stationary when it admits a time-like Killing vector field, which in adapted coordinates takes the form ξ  =  ∂t. Here t is a timelike coordinate along the integral lines of the Killing vector field. A space-time is called static if in addition the Killing vector field is hypersurface orthogonal. The latter statement is equivalent to the existence of a coordinate transformation which removes the mixed components gti of the metric. For non-static stationary black holes one needs to require that they are axisymmetric. The associated Killing vector field is denoted ∂φ. Moreover it must be symmetric under simultanous reflection of the time coordinate t and the angular coordinate φ. This is called t - φ reflection symmetry and is a well-known property of the Kerr solution. Concerning condition (ii): a Killing horizon is a hypersurface in space-time where a Killing vector fields becomes null. In Einstein gravity all event horizons of stationary black holes are Killing horizons. It is not known whether this is true for general gravitational actions, but the proofs of the zeroth and first theorem make use of this property. For static black holes the 'horizontal' Killing vector field is just the one associated with time-translation invariance, ξ  =  ∂t, whereas it takes the form ξ  =  ∂t  +  ω∂φ in the non-static case. A surface gravity can be naturally defined for any Killing horizon, and its properties are essentially determined by the horizontal Killing vector field. Concerning condition (iii): this means that the space-time has a Cauchy hypersurface and, hence, a well defined initial value problem. With these assumptions the zeroth law can be proved, without using the explicit form of the field equations. The proof of the first theorem needs an additional ingredient: the definition of the black hole entropy needs to be generalized. The proof of the first law for general actions relies on the observation that all the quantities which are varied, i.e., mass, entropy, angular momentum and charge can be expressed as surface charges. This is well known for the electric charge, which can be measured by the flux of the electric field through a two-sphere at spatial infinity. But it is also true for entropy, mass and angular momentum. The reason is that the Noether current associated with reparametrisations is itself a total derivative, i.e., it can be written as the divergence of an antisymmetric Noether potential, [formula] [\cite=Wald:90]. Therefore the associated Noether charges, which a priori involve integration over a spatial hypersurface, can be re-written as surface charges. The basic observation underlying the proof of the first law is that the Noether charge associated with the horizontal Killing vector field ξ  =  ∂t  +  ω∂φ does not change when deforming a given stationary solution infinitesimally into another stationary solution [\cite=Wald:93]. The Noether charge receives two contributions, one from infinity, the other from the horizon. Since the total charge is conserved, changes in the two contributions must balance against each other. The contribution from infinity contains two terms: one proportional to ∂t, which gives the change in mass, another one proportional to ∂φ, which gives the change in angular momentum. Therefore the contribution from the horizon is interpreted as the change in entropy. This can be used to define the black hole entropy for general gravitational actions such that the first law of black hole mechanics holds:

[formula]

where the entropy is given by Wald's formula [\cite=Wald:93]

[formula]

The tensor field μν is related to the Noether potential Qμν by scaling out the surface gravity κS. The integral can be taken over any spatial section H of the event horizon [\cite=Myers]. The Noether charge is linear in the Killing vector field and its derivatives. It has been shown that it can be expressed in terms of the variational derivative of the Lagrangian with respect to the Riemann tensor by [\cite=WaldVar]

[formula]

Here εμν is the normal bivector of H, and h denotes the induced metric. It is easy to check that this formula reproduces the area law [formula] if the only term which contributes is the Einstein-Hilbert term. However, if the action contains further curvature terms, there are modifications in general.

At this point it is natural to wonder whether the second law can be proved for general gravitational actions. Though it has been observed in the literature that the Noether charge is well defined and natural for non-stationary space-times [\cite=WaldVar], there is no general proof of the second law in this setting. Since one has to admit dynamical processes such as black hole collisions and black hole fusion, one might also question whether the second law should hold for any action, or whether it singles out a subclass of 'physically reasonable' ones. We will comment on the second and third law for quantum black holes in the next section.

Quantum mechanical aspects of black holes

So far our discussion appeared to be purely classical, in that we studied the properties of stationary black hole solutions associated to some Lagrangian. But as is obvious from the very name, black holes can only absorbe matter and radiation, and therefore it does not make sense to assign to them a finite temperature. This changes once quantum effects in the matter sector are taken into account. This can be done using quantum field theory in curved space-time, where gravity is taken as a classical background field, while matter is described by quantum field theory [\cite=Wald2] [\cite=BirDav] [\cite=FroNov]. The Hawking effect [\cite=Haw] can be derived by either taking space-time to describe the collapse of a mass distribution, or by taking a stationary black hole background. In both cases one finds outgoing radiation which allows to assign the (Hawking) temperature ([\ref=HawkingTemperature]) to the black hole. Combining this with the first law one concludes that the black hole should have the entropy

[formula]

where we took already into account that the area law is modified when further curvature terms are present in the Lagrangian.

Of course, quantum field theory in curved space-time is only an approximation of a full theory of quantum gravity. The full quantum treatment of black holes poses a lot of challenges, both conceptually and technically. The success of any proposed theory of quantum gravity can be judged by its capability to provide answers. Here we will focus on one particular aspect, the so-called entropy problem, and we will review what string theory has to say about this. We will not be able to give a complete overview, but focus on one line of thought, which can be tested with high precision.

The entropy S appearing in the laws of black hole mechanics should be interpreted as a thermodynamical or macroscopic entropy, denoted Smacro. More generally, we think about the description of black holes provided by a general gravitational action as a coarse-grained, macroscopic, effective description of an underlying microscopic quantum theory. The microcsopic or statistical entropy Smicro is then given by

[formula]

where d(M,J,q) is the number of microstates of a black hole with the macroscopic parameters M,J,q. We expect that macroscopic and microscopic entropy agree, at least in the thermodynamical limit, which we identify with the semiclassical limit where the macroscopic parameters (if non-vanishing) become large.

The reason why we reviewed the definition of the (macroscopic) entropy for generally covariant theories is that we want to make a detailed comparison between both entropies, including subleading corrections. The Lagrangians which we use in the macroscopic description are taken to be effective Lagrangians derived from an underlying microscopic theory by integrating out the massive modes and expanding in derivatives. Such effective Lagrangians are expected to be covariant, and to contain higher derivative and in particular higher curvature terms. Any quantum theory of gravity should provide a way for calculating effective Lagrangians. In string theory effective Lagrangians are computable in principle (UV finiteness), and they have been computed in practice in several cases.

On the microscopic side one needs to identify and count the microstates which give rise to the same coarse-grained macrostate. The basic idea will be explained in the next section. Before turning to this, let us also point out that there are further goals beyond just matching the macroscopic and microscopic entropy. Ultimately one would like to derive the macroscopic properties of black holes from the underlying microscopic theory. One step in this direction is the OSV conjecture [\cite=OSV], which defines a black hole partition function and relates it to the partition function of the topological string. We will come back to this at the end of this article.

Finally, let us comment on the second and third law in the quantum realm. Since Hawking radiation extracts energy from a black hole, it will shrink, thus violating the second law of black hole mechanics. This complements the observation that the presence of black holes leads to a violation of the classical second law of thermodynamics, because entropy could be reduced by moving matter adiabatically into black holes. This is an independent motivation for assigning an entropy to black holes [\cite=Bekenstein]. The generalized second law of thermodynamics, which is expected to hold quantum mechanically, states that the total entropy obtained by adding thermodynamical and black hole entropy is non-decreasing.

Like the third law of thermodynamics, the third law of black hole mechanics has different versions. The strong version states that in the extremal limit (zero temperature) the entropy vanishes. This version is already violated in thermodynamics [\cite=Kiefer], and for black holes it is at odds with the fact that extremal black holes have a finite horizon. While the application of Euclidean methods to extremal black holes yields a vanishing entropy [\cite=ZeroEntropy], it has been pointed out in [\cite=LouKie] that the extremal limit does not commute with quantization. If the extremal limit is taken within the quantum theory, the entropy is finite. This is consistent with results from string theory where extremal black holes have a finite microscopic entropy [\cite=StrVaf]. The weak version of the third theorem states the extremal limit cannot be reached in finite time by any physical process. We refer to [\cite=Wald] [\cite=Kiefer] for a more detailed discussion. For our purposes the third law will not be of great importance. We will be mainly concerned with extremal black holes, but these are used as theoretical laboratories to test ideas, not as a realistic description of astrophysical black holes. Therefore it not important whether the extremal limit can actually be reached in finite time.

The string-black hole correspondence

The string-black hole correspondence introduced in [\cite=Sus:93] is a heuristic but very general way to understand the entropy of black holes. The basic idea is that black hole microstates simply are states of highly excited massive strings. Consider, for concreteness, strings moving in a flat four-dimensional space-time (neglecting that quantum consistency requires additional dimensions). Since string theory contains gravity, one might wonder why it is allowed to neglect the backreaction of the strings on space-time. The answer is that at asymptotically small string coupling the string scale [formula] is much larger than the Schwarzschild radius of the string, rS. Since the Schwarzschild radius sets the scale for the backreaction on space-time, it is consistent to treat space-time as a flat background in the string perturbative regime [formula]. However, if we sufficiently increase the mass (at fixed coupling) or the coupling (at fixed mass), then rS will grow relative to [formula] and, ultimately it will become comparable. While not much is known about what happens precisely in this regime, we can go to the opposite limit where [formula]. Now the Schwarzschild radius is much larger than the string scale, and stringy effects are suppressed. Therefore we can apply classical gravity and conclude that the string state should be described as a black hole, because it sits within its Schwarzschild radius. Note that [formula] means that higher derivative terms in the effective Lagrangian are suppressed. We call this regime the semi-classical gravity regime.

Assuming that the interpolation is allowed, we can count the number of states of a string of given mass and compare it to the entropy of a black hole of the same mass. We need a few formulae. First note that in four dimensions the Regge slope α' and Newton's constant GN are related by

[formula]

where gS is the four-dimensional string coupling. For large excitation numbers [formula], the mass M of a string state goes like

[formula]

The number of states at given n grows like [formula] [\cite=GSW], so that the microscopic (statistical) entropy is (to leading order)

[formula]

Using the relation between GN and α', the Schwarzschild radius of a string state of level n is

[formula]

Now we can read off that the string perturbative regime corresponds to [formula], while the semiclassical gravity regime corresponds to [formula]. We can also compare the statistical entropy ([\ref=Sstatstring]) of string states to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy Smacro≃A≃r2S of a black hole of the same mass. While both entropies disagree in general, we observe that they are equal within one order of magnitude when the Schwarzschild radius equals the string scale:

[formula]

This is of course the regime where we cannot describe the black hole in detail. But the matching of the entropies suggests that there is a transition between the two descriptions in this regime. This might be a phase transition or a smooth crossover, and is possibly related to the Hagedorn transition. This scenario makes a prediction for the final state of black hole evaporation: a black hole looses mass through Hawking radiation until its size reaches the string scale where it converts into a highly excited string state. Since there is precisely the right number of string states to account for the black hole entropy, one expects that the time evolution is unitary and that there is no information loss.

While this picture of black holes is very general, it is heuristic and begs many questions. A priori it is not clear whether the number of states should be conserved when we interpolate between the two regimes. Also, the matching ([\ref=Matching1]) holds only up to factors of order unity, and there are subleading corrections on both sides. One way to improve the situation is to consider special supersymmetric (BPS) states, where both the macroscopic entropy Smacro and the microscopic entropy Smicro can be computed to high precision in their respective regimes. The interpolation between both regimes is also more reliable in this case, because BPS states saturate the mass bound implied by the supersymmetry algebra (more later). While the original string-black hole correspondences only invokes fundamental string states, there are other candidates for black hole microstates in string theory. One important class are D-branes whose excitations are described by the open strings ending on it. The first successful quantitative derivation of black hole entropy was based on D-branes [\cite=StrVaf]. A unified formulation of the string-black hole correspondence which encompases both fundamental string states and D-branes was formulated in [\cite=HorPol].

We should also stress that the space-time into which the fundamental strings or D-branes are embedded need not to be flat. It can be any curved (on-shell) string background. If we want to describe four-dimensional black holes we should consider space-times where the extra dimensions have been compactified. While this enlarges the number of possible microscopic descriptions of black holes, one feature that we saw in the above example remains: one needs to interpolate between two regimes. The state counting is done in a regime where the feedback of strings and D-branes on the background can be neglected, while the description as a four-dimensional black hole with an event horizon is valid when we can use a four-dimensional effective action. The interpolation between these two regimes involves the variation of the string coupling and possibly of geometrical moduli.

Black holes in N = 2 supergravity

BPS states and BPS solitons

Let us review some standard facts about supersymmetry algebras and their representations [\cite=WessBagger] [\cite=West]. The N-extended four-dimensional supersymmetry algebra takes the following form:

[formula]

where [formula] labels the supercharges, which we have taken to be Majorana spinors. ZAB is a complex antisymmetric matrix of central operators. Using R-symmetry rotations it can be skew-diagonalized. The eigenvalues, called central charges are constant on irreducible representations by Schur's lemma. The same is true for the mass M2  =    -  PμPμ. Using the algebra one can show that the mass is bounded by the central charges:

[formula]

If one or several of the inequalities for M are saturated, then part of the supercharges operate trivially. As a result the corresponding representation is smaller than a generic massive representation. Such representations are called BPS representations, also shortened representations or supersymmetric representations (since the states are invariant under part of the supersymmetry transformations). The most extreme case are the short or [formula]-BPS representations, where all central charges are equal: [formula] Such representations are invariant under half of the supersymmetry transformations and have as many states as massless representations.

BPS states cannot only be realized as one-particle representations on the Hilbert space, but also as finite energy solutions of the field equations. Such objects are called BPS solitons. By soliton we refer to stationary, finite energy solutions Φ0 to the equations of motion, which are regular in the sense of not having naked singularities (admitting black holes). Note that due to the finite energy condition a soliton must approach the vacuum asymptotically. Since its energy density is effectively localized in space, it is considered as a particle-like object. BPS solitons (also called supersymmetric solitons) are in addition invariant under a subset of the supersymmetry transformations. I.e., the supersymmetry transformation parameters ε can be chosen such that the field configuration Φ0 is invariant:

[formula]

The corresponding transformation parameters ε are called Killing spinors.

The extremal Reissner-Nordstrom black hole is a standard example for a BPS soliton [\cite=Gibbons]. Since it is the prototype for the supersymmetric black holes to be considered later, let us review its key features. Einstein-Maxwell theory is the bosonic part of N = 2 supergravity. Therefore the extremal Reissner-Nordstrom black hole is a solution to the full field equations of N = 2 supergravity. The two gravitini, which provide the fermionic degrees of freedom are identically zero in this solution. Since the N = 2 supersymmetry algebra has eight real supercharges (two Majorana spinors), there can be at most eight linearly independent Killing spinors. The extremal Reissner-Nordstrom black hole has four Killing spinors and is therefore a [formula]-BPS solution. At infinity the solution approaches the Minkowski vacuum, which is a supersymmetric ground state and therefore invariant under all supersymmetry transformations. The eight linearly independent Killing spinors can be taken to be constant. A doubling of unbroken supersymmetries also occurs at the event horizon. The asymptotic near-horizon solution is the so-called Bertotti-Robinson solution. The geometry is AdS2  ×  S2, while the gauge field is covariantly constant. This solution has eight Killing spinors, and can therefore be considered as an alternative supersymmetric vacuum. We observe a feature which is typical for two-dimensional solitons: the solution interpolates between two vacua. This is understandable, since the extreme Reissner-Nordstrom solution is spherically symmetric and effectively depends only on one spatial coordinate, the radial one.

Special geometry

We will be interested in BPS black holes in four-dimensional string compactifications with N = 2 and N = 4 supersymmetry. The compactification of the heterotic string on K3  ×  T2 or of the type-II string on a Calabi-Yau threefold gives N = 2 supergravity plus some number n of vector multiplets plus further matter multiplets which are irrelevant for our purposes. The compactification of the heterotic string on T6 or of the type-II string on K3  ×  T2 gives N = 4 supergravity plus some number n of vector multiplets. We will describe the N = 4 theory using the N = 2 formalism. Therefore we need to discuss N = 2 vector multiplets.

The main tool for handling N = 2 vector multiplets is the so-called special geometry discovered in [\cite=deWVPr]. While the Lagrangian is complicated, all couplings are encoded in a single holomorphic function, the prepotential. This results from an invariance of the field equations under [formula] transformations, which generalize the electric-magnetic duality rotations of Maxwell theory. Stringy symmetries, such as T-duality and S-duality, form a discrete subgroup of this symplectic group.

Let us provide some details. The N = 2 gravity multiplet contains the vielbein (graviton), a doublet of Majorana gravitini, and a vector field called the graviphoton. A vector multiplet contains a vector field, a doublet of spinors and a complex scalar. The bosonic Lagrangian is a generalized Einstein-Maxwell Lagrangian plus a scalar sigma-model:

[formula]

Here zA, [formula] are the scalar fields, and the field dependent coupling [formula] can be interpreted as the metric of the scalar manifold MVM. F±  Iμν are the (anti-)selfdual parts of the field strength of the n + 1 vector fields, [formula]. The gauge couplings [formula] are field-dependent.

To make the [formula] invariance of the field equations manifest, one defines the dual field strength by

[formula]

These are of course dependent fields, but they are useful because (F±  Iμν,G±I|μν)T transforms linearly under [formula]. Such quantities are called symplectic vectors. Another symplectic vector is provided by the magnetic and electric charges, (pI,qI)T. This is clear because the charges are obtained by integrating the (dual) field strength over an asymptotic two-sphere: [formula], [formula]. The [formula] transformations are not only invariances of the gauge field equations but of the full field equations. To describe the scalars in a covariant way, one does not work with the physical scalar fields zA, but with a symplectic vector (XI,FI)T. Here XI are homogenous coordinates on the scalar manifold MVM, i.e. [formula]. The prepotential F, which encodes all vector multiplet coulings, is a function of the XI. Local N = 2 supersymmetry implies that it is holomorphic and homogenous of degree two:

[formula]

The quantities FI which complete the symplectic vector (XI,FI)T, are the components of the gradient of F(XI):

[formula]

The structure of the scalar sector becomes transparent when constructing the theory using the superconformal calculus. Here one starts with n + 1 vector multiplets with scalars XI and imposes that the theory is superconformally invariant. While (rigid) N = 2 supersymmetry implies the existence of a holomorphic prepotential, superconformal invariance imposes in addition that F must be homogenous of degree two. The next step is to make the superconformal symmetry local. The necessary covariantization introduces gauge fields which belong to the so-called Weyl multiplet. The resulting theory turns out to be gauge equivalent to N = 2 Poincaré supergravity. This means that one can gauge fix the additional symmetries to obtain a Poincaré supergravity theory. Conversely, a Poincaré supergravity theory can be made superconformal by simultanously introducing new symmetries and new fields which act as compensators. The gauge fixing imposes one (complex) relation on the superconformal scalars XI, which can then be expressed in terms of the n independent physical scalars zA. In contrast, all n + 1 gauge fields remain independent, although one of them becomes part of the Poincaré gravity multiplet, so that only n vector multiplets remain. The other physical degrees of freedom of the Poincaré gravity multiplet, namely the graviton and two gravitini are provided by the Weyl multiplet.

The scalar geometry can be cast in the following form, as explained in [\cite=ACD]: while the physical scalars zA are coordinates on a complex n-dimensional Kähler manifold MVM, the scalars XI are coordinates on a complex cone NVM over MVM. This cone is the scalar manifold of the rigid superconformal theory used as the starting point in the superconformal calculus. The existence of a holomorphic prepotential is equivalent to the local existence of a holomorphic Lagrangian immersion φ  =  dF of the cone into the flat complex symplectic vector space [formula]. The quantities (XI,FI)T can be interpreted as symplectic coordinates on [formula]. NVM is generically immersed into this space as a graph. Therefore one can take the XI as coordinates on NVM, and the FI become functions of the XI along the immersed space. Since the immersion is Lagrangian, the FI form the gradient of some function F, which generates the immersion. All geometric data of the cone, i.p. its Kähler metric and its Kähler form can be obtaind by pulling back the standard hermitean form of [formula] with φ. As a result all data can be expressed through the prepotential. In particular the Kähler metric on NVM has a holomorphic prepotential. Note that the relation between NVM and [formula] applies irrespective of whether the prepotential is homogenous or not. Manifolds which can be obtained through this construction as holomorphic, Lagrangian immersions into a complex symplectic vector space are called affine special Kähler manifolds. They are the scalar manifolds of (not necesserily superconformal) rigid N = 2 vector multiplets.

If one imposes superconformal invariance, the prepotential must be homogenous of degree two. Geometrically, this implies that the affine special Kähler manifold NVM is a complex cone. One can then perform a [formula]-quotient and obtain a new Kähler manifold MVM, which is the basis of the complex cone. Such manifolds are called projective special Kähler manifolds, and they are the scalar target spaces of N = 2 vector multiplets coupled to Poincaré supergravity. The Kähler potential of the metric on MVM, in fact all couplings in the Poincaré supergravity Lagrangian, can be expressed in terms of the prepotential F.

A natural realization of special geometry is provided by the moduli space of Calabi-Yau threefolds X. In string theory this occurs, for example, when compactifying type IIB string theory on X. Then the scalar manifold of the physical vector multiplet scalars zA is the moduli space of complex structures of X, while the cone parametrized by the XI is obtained by combining deformations of the complex structure with those of the holomorphic top form. The complex vector space into which the resulting cone can be embedded is the complex middle cohomology [formula]. Its coordinates (XI,FI) are the periods of the holomorphic top form.

The black hole attractor mechanism

We now turn to [formula]-BPS solutions of N = 2 supergravity. As we will see special geometry is extremely useful in finding and analysing solutions. We only consider static, spherically symmetric solutions which describe a single extremal black hole. Then the line element takes the form

[formula]

and supersymmetry requires in addition that g(r)  =   - f(r) [\cite=CdWKM:2000]. Moreover each gauge field has only two independent components, corresponding to static, radially symmetric electric and magnetic fields. The main new feature compared to the extremal Reissner-Nordstrom black hole is that there are scalar fields, zA(r). To maintain symplectic covariance one can work with the conformal scalars XI(r). In fact, it is convenient to rescale the XI(r) such that they become invariant under the radial U(1)-part of the [formula]-transformations. This can be done using the symplectic function

[formula]

which transforms with the same phase as XI. In an asymptotically flat background this function agrees with the central charge of the N = 2 supersymmetry algebra, when evaluated at infinity. Therefore it is often simply called the central charge. Note however that Z is a function, which through the scalar fields depends on space-time, i.e. Z = Z(r) for the backgrounds under consideration. The U(1)-invariant scalars are then defined by [formula] [\cite=CdWKM:2000]. Note that the physical scalars are given by zA(r)  =  YA(r) / Y0(r).

The resulting solutions [\cite=BLS] [\cite=CdWKM:2000] have two interesting asymptotic regimes. The first is r  →    ∞  , where they become asymptotically flat. In this limit the scalars approach arbitrary values zA  →  zA(  ∞  )∈MVM. Together with the 2n + 2 charges pI,qI there are 4n + 2 real integration constants. The second asymptotic regime is the event horizon, r  →  0. Here the scalars do not take arbitrary values, but specific fixed point values which are determined by the charges. This is the celebrated black hole attractor mechanism [\cite=FKS]. The reason for this behaviour is that if the solution is to remain regular at the horizon, it has to approach the Bertotti-Robinson solution AdS2  ×  S2, which has eight Killing spinors and is fully supersymmetric. The fact that the scalars take special fixed point values follows from gradient flow equations implied by the gaugino variations [\cite=FKS]. It also follows by imposing full supersymmetry, irrespective of whether the resulting Bertotti-Robinson solution is global, or the near horizon asymptotics of a black hole [\cite=CdWKM:2000]. Alternatively, the attractor mechanism can be derived from the equations of motion, for example by studying the motion of a test particle in the near horizon geometry [\cite=FGK]. This is governed by an effective 'black hole potential', which is extremized at the horizon. Equivalently, we might think about the Bertotti-Robinson solution as a flux compactification from four to two dimensions. Since the S2 factor is not Ricci flat, flux (a covariantly constant gauge field) has to be turned on to solve the Einstein equations. This induces a potential for the scalars, which is extremized at the horizon. The latter arguments rely on the equations of motion and do not depend on supersymmetry. They therefore suggest that the attractor mechanism can also be realized for non-supersymmetric black holes. This is indeed true, as we will review below.

The values of the scalar fields at the horizon are determined by the so-called attractor equations (or stabilization equations), which in our conventions take the following form:

[formula]

where *   denotes evaluation at the horizon. Observe that this is an equation between two symplectic vectors.

As a consequence, the black hole entropy only depends on the (discrete) charges, but not on the (continuous) moduli zA(  ∞  ). The area of the event horizon is proportional to |Z|2*, where the symplectic function Z  =  pIFI(X)  -  qIXI is now evaluated on the event horizon. As a result the macroscopic entropy is a symplectic function:

[formula]

The black hole variational principle

Shortly after the discovery of the black hole attractor mechanism, it was observed that the attractor equations follow from a variational principle [\cite=BCdWKLM]. The importance of this observation was only appreciated much later, after the work of [\cite=OSV] uncovered a direct link between black hole entropy and the topological string partition function.

The variational principle is based on the following 'entropy function'

[formula]

where

[formula]

is the black hole 'free energy'. Both entropy function and free energy are symplectic functions. It is straightforward to verify that the extremisation equations

[formula]

for the entropy function are precisely the black hole attractor equations ([\ref=AttractorEqsI]). Moreover, at the critical point Σ equals the black hole entropy, up to a conventional factor:

[formula]

The geometrical meaning of the variational principle becomes clearer when one parametrizes the scalar manifold NVM using real variables [\cite=CdWKM:2006]. Equation ([\ref=EntropyFunction]) suggests to use

[formula]

instead of YI as coordinates on NVM. The real quantities xI,yI are indeed Darboux coordinates on NVM [\cite=Freed]. The transition between the coordinates YI  =  YI  +  iYI and the coordinates xI,yI can be viewed as a Legendre transform, which replaces uI  =  YI by yI  =  FI as independent variables. When working with the real coordinates xI,yI, the metric on NVM (and in fact all couplings in the Lagrangian) can be expressed in terms of a Hesse potential H(x,y), which is, up to a factor, the Legendre transform of the imaginary part of the holomorphic prepotential [\cite=Cor:01]:

[formula]

Using the homogenity properties of the prepotential one sees immediately that the black hole free energy equals the Hesse potential, up to a factor:

[formula]

Moreover, when expressing the entropy function in terms of real variables,

[formula]

we see that the black hole variational principle also can be expressed in terms of a Legendre transform: the black hole entropy is (up to a factor), the Legendre transform of the Hesse potential

[formula]

This observation motivates to call [formula] the black hole free energy.

R2-corrections

So far, our discussion referred to supergravity actions containing up to two derivatives of the fields. Effective actions derived from string theory contain an infinite series of higher derivative terms, which are computable, at least in principle, in perturbation theory. In four-dimensional N = 2 supergravity there is a particular class of higher derivative terms, often called 'R2-terms', for which an off-shell description is available. It is advisable to work in the superconformal formalism, where the gravitational degrees of freedom reside in the Weyl multiplet. Then, R2-terms can be taken into account by giving the prepotential an explicit dependence on an additional complex variable Υ, which is proportional to the lowest component of the Weyl multiplet. The function F(YI,Υ) is restricted by supersymmetry to be holomorphic and ('graded') homogenous of degree two:

[formula]

In order to determine this function for N = 2 string compactifications, one expands it in powers of Υ:

[formula]

It turns out that in type-II Calabi-Yau compactifications the coefficient functions F(g)(YI) are proportional to the so-called genus-g topological free energy. I.e., exp F(g) is the genus-g partition function of the topologically twisted type-II string on the given Calabi-Yau manifold [\cite=BCO]. In the string effective action they occur as couplings in front of certain higher-derivative terms [\cite=AGNT]. Among these are terms of the form

[formula]

where C-μνρσ is the anti-selfdual part of the (space-time) Weyl tensor, and T-αβ is the anti-selfdual part of the antisymmetric tensor field sitting in the lowest component of the Weyl multiplet. These terms are responsible for the terminology 'R2-terms', as they are quadratic in the Riemann tensor. Note that there are several other higher-derivative terms, which are related to the ones given here by supersymmetry.

Using the superconformal off-shell formalism, the effect of these R2-terms on black holes can be analyzed in surprising generality [\cite=CdWM:98] [\cite=CdWKM:2000]. One can even construct explicit solutions, at least iteratively. The attractor equations generalize by replacing the prepotential by the function F(YI,Υ), where the auxiliary field Υ takes a specific constant value on the horizon:

[formula]

When computing the entropy one needs to replace the naive area law by Wald's generalized formula ([\ref=Wald]), since higher curvature terms are present in the Lagrangian. Application of the general entropy formula to the N = 2 supergravity Lagrangian results in the following expression for the entropy, which is a symplectic function:

[formula]

Note that the entropy gets modified by the higher derivative terms in two ways. First, the area of the event horizon changes, which is apparent from the presence of the full function F(YI,Υ) in the attractor equations and in the area term in the entropy formula. Second, there is a modification of the area law by the last term. Like the area, this term is a symplectic function. A matching between macroscopic and microscopic entropy is only found, when both corrections are taken into account [\cite=CdWM:98].

Other higher derivative terms

The Weyl multiplet encodes one specific class of higher derivative terms, namely those of the form ([\ref=HDterms]) and their supersymmetry transforms. The string effective action includes many other higher derivative terms, for example terms involving higher powers of the Riemann tensor. It is natural to expect that such terms should contribute to the entropy as well.

There is, however, strong evidence that the R2-terms are at least the most important class. It is precisely these terms which are captured by the topological string. Since the topological string seems to encode all important phenomenological features of string compactifications, one might expect that the same is true for black holes. While this is not a particularly strong argument by itself, strong 'empirical' evidence stems from the observation that already the inclusion of the R2-terms leads to a remarkable quantitative matching between macroscopic and microscopic entropy, including in some cases even infinitely many subleading terms [\cite=CdWM:98] [\cite=CdWM:9906] [\cite=CdWKM:2000]. R2-terms also have the remarkable property that they can resolve null singularities [\cite=DabKalMal]. These are singularities which coincide with an event horizon. In our context this occurs in the form of black hole solutions which have a vanishing area of event horizon. There are many examples where black hole solutions are null singular at the two-derivative level but become regular black hole solutions with a finite event horizon once R2-corrections are taken into account. Such black holes are called 'small' black holes, because their area is small when measured in string units. In contrast 'large' black holes already have a nonvanishing horizon at the two-derivative level. While R2-terms resolve the null singularities of most of the known small black holes, there are a few counterexamples where further higher derivative terms are needed [\cite=Sen:0504] [\cite=DDMP2]. This illustrates that it is important to construct and study further classes of higher derivative terms in supergravity. An important step forward in this direction was made recently, in the framework of the superconformal calculus [\cite=deWSau]. One interesting observation made there is that while several further supersymmetric higher derivative terms can be constructed, there are cancellations among them when the background is restricted to be supersymmetric. This confirms the distinguished role of the R2-terms. Another important observation was made in [\cite=BCM] and [\cite=Sen:05]: the same answer for the entropy is obtained by simply adding, instead of the whole set of supersymmetric R2-terms, the Gauss-Bonnet term to the Einstein-Hilbert action. This suggest that the black hole entropy is a 'robust' quantity, in the sense that gravitational Lagrangians form large equivalence classes which lead to identical results for the entropy. Finally, yet another argument for the particular role of the R2-terms comes from the AdS3 / CFT2 correspondence, on which we comment in the next section.

The AdS3 / CFT2 correspondence

The AdS3 / CFT2 correspondence provides a general and robust way to study the relation between microscopic and macroscopic properties of four-dimensional black holes [\cite=KraLar:2005] [\cite=GSY:06]. More generally, the correspondence can be applied whenever the near horizon geometry of a black hole is locally of the form AdS3  ×  Sn, where Sn is an n-dimensional sphere. In the known examples the global geometry of the three-dimensional part is a discrete quotient of AdS3, typically a BTZ black hole or an [formula] transform thereof [\cite=KraLar:2006] [\cite=dBCDMV]. For four-dimensional extremal black holes the near horizon geometry is locally AdS2  ×  S2, but in string compactifications the AdS2 factor can combine with an internal S1 to form an AdS3. One can then use the correspondence between gravity or string theory on AdS3 and a two-dimensional conformal field theory on the (conformal) boundary of the AdS-space. States can be counted in the CFT2. Already the central charge gives the leading asymptotics of states by Cardy's formula. If the partition function is known, one can compute further corrections. Accepting the AdS / CFT correspondence in generality, one can apply it to non-superysmmetric black holes. One can also treat non-extremal black holes, if they can be related to non-extremal BTZ black holes.

In [\cite=SaiSod] [\cite=KraLar:2005] the correspondence was used to argue that the Cardy formula for the CFT2 agrees with the entropy of the corresponding black hole, including higher derivative corrections. Moreover, after lifting four-dimensional black holes to five dimensions one can use anomalies to rederive the entropy formula for BPS black holes in Calabi-Yau compactifications of eleven-dimensional M-theory [\cite=KraLar:2005] [\cite=KraLar:0508]. This derivation shows again the distinguished role of R2-terms, since it suffices to consider them in order to find the full anomaly. Thus other higher derivative terms do not contribute to the anomaly, and, hence not to the black hole entropy. This anomaly argument also applies to non-BPS black holes.

The interested reader is referred to the nice lecture notes [\cite=Kraus] for a detailed review of the AdS3 / CFT2 correspondence and its application to black holes. If the partition function of the CFT2 is known explicitly, one can evaluate the state degeneracy beyond leading order. We will encounter some of these results later in the context of black hole partition functions. Here we add some comments on the limitations of the AdS3 / CFT2 approach. The first limitation is that not all black holes can be related to AdS3. One straightforward way to obtain a four-dimensional extremal black hole with horizon AdS2  ×  S2 from five dimensions is to compactify a five-dimensional BPS black string with horizon AdS3  ×  S2 [\cite=ChaFerGibKal] [\cite=ChaSab] on S1, while adding momentum along the string [\cite=MSW]. This accounts for half of the possible charges of a four-dimensional black hole, and further charges can be included, for example as induced M2-brane charges if one considers eleven-dimensional supergravity compactified on CY3  ×  S1 (where CY3 denotes a Calabi-Yau threefold) [\cite=MSW]. In fact, even the general four-dimensional BPS black hole can be lifted to a spinning five-dimensional BPS black hole [\cite=GSY:05], but the near horizon geometry is more complicated. In particular, one needs to superimpose a Taub-NUT solution to account for non-vanishing D6 charge. Thus additional input is needed to fully account for the microscopic description of spinning five-dimensional and general four-dimensional BPS black holes. Additional examples of interesting black holes which do not have an AdS3 description can be found in [\cite=DabSenTri]. Another problem is the regime in parameter space where one can apply the correspondence after lifting a local AdS2 factor to a local AdS3 factor. As explained in [\cite=DabSenTri] this is only adaequate if the additional circle is large, which imposes a constraint on the charges. If, for example, all charges are large, then the extra circle is not large, and the dimensional reduction of the AdS3 theory on the circle fails to capture the full dynamics in AdS2. As a consequence there are corrections to the Cardy formula, which are sensitive to the details of the boundary CFT2. A probably related question is how to account for the world-sheet and space-time instanton corrections of the four-dimensional theory. This manifests itself already at the two-derivative level. While supersymmetry only restricts the prepotential of the four-dimensional supergravity theory to be holomorphic and homogenous of degree two, the prepotential of the dimensionally lifted five-dimensional supergravity theory must be a cubic polynomial. The finiteness of the fifth dimension gives rise to an infinite series of subleading corrections, which, in string theory, correspond to world-sheet and space-time instantons which have finite action once the additional compact direction becomes available. Finally, while the AdS3 / CFT2 correspondence is robust in the sense of being independent of details of the dynamics, and can potentially be used for non-supersymmetric and non-extremal black holes, one still needs to make the assumption that the AdS2 or AdS3 geometry survives corrections, i.p. higher derivative corrections. For four-dimensional BPS black holes we know by explicit construction that the near horizon geometry survives the R2-corrections [\cite=CdWKM:2000], and it is desirable to also have explicit results for five-dimensional black holes, and for other classes of higher derivative terms.

Non-supersymmetric black holes

The black hole attractor mechanism also works for black holes which are extremal, but not supersymmetric, i.e. for black holes which do not admit Killing spinors, but have the near horizon asymptotics AdS2  ×  S2 [\cite=FGK] [\cite=GIJT]. With hindsight the presence of an attractor mechanism is easy to understand, given the interpreation of AdS2  ×  S2 as a flux compactification. The background flux induces an effective potential for the scalars, which is extremized at the horizon. This naturally fixes the scalars. Since this argument relies on the field equations and the structure of the bosonic Lagrangian, it does not depend on supersymmetry. It applies to non-supersymmetric Lagrangians, and to both BPS and non-BPS extremal solutions of supersymmetric Lagrangians.

An elegant formalism for the treatment of general extremal black holes was introduced by A. Sen [\cite=SenEntropyFct]. In this formalism one can use any covariant Einstein-Maxwell type Lagrangian, including matter and higher derivative terms, as input. From the Lagrangian one extracts an entropy function by dimensional reduction in the near-horizon geometry. The entropy function yields the entropy upon extremisation. Since the entropy can itself be expressed in terms of variational derivatives of the Lagrangian, everything is tied directly to the Lagrangian. This approach is independent of the details of the field equations, as long as they come from a generally covariant Lagrangian and admit extremal solutions. Since there is an underlying variational principle, one might expect that there is a close relation to the variational principle for BPS black holes, which we described in section [\ref=Sect:VarPri]. Indeed, it has been shown in [\cite=CdWMa] that the two entropy functions only differ by terms which vanish in supersymmetric backgrounds.

The entropy function approach was used in [\cite=SahSen] to compute the entropy of BPS and non-BPS extremal black holes in N = 2 supergravity with higher derivative corrections. While the results agree with previous results for BPS black holes, they found a disagreement for non-BPS black holes when comparing to the dimensional reduction of the results of [\cite=KraLar:2005]. This discrepancy was resolved in [\cite=SahSen:0608], who found that further terms in the effective action have to be taken into account, which descend by dimensional reduction from Chern-Simons terms. While the original definition of an entropy function does not apply when Chern-Simons terms are present, generalizations have been formulated, which allow to include three-dimensional BTZ black holes [\cite=SahSen:06] and extremal, rotating black hole solutions of five-dimensional supergravity [\cite=COP] [\cite=GolJen]. An entropy function for non-extremal black holes with a BTZ factor has been proposed in [\cite=SahSen:06] [\cite=CaiPang].

The detailed study of explicit non-BPS solutions in supersymmetric compactifications, and of non-BPS fixed points of the attractor equations has become an active subject starting from [\cite=GIJT] [\cite=Kal:2005]. A very important question, which has been re-addressed recently in [\cite=DabSenTri] is whether one can count microstates for non-BPS extremal black holes. Surprisingly the conclusion is that under certain assumptions the attractor mechanism allows one to reliably extrapolate the macroscopic entropy from the semi-classical gravity regime to the string perturbative regime, where microstates can be counted.

Finally, we already mentioned how one particular version of the AdS / CFT correspondence can be used to investigate non-BPS black holes. Let us add that this correspondence can also applied in many other ways. In particular, it can be applied to non-extremal black holes, if they are asymptotically AdS at infinity. Such black holes correspond to thermal states of the dual gauge theory [\cite=WitAdS].

Black hole partition functions

Reduced variational principles

When we discussed the variational principle for BPS black holes in section [\ref=Sect:VarPri], all attractor equations were imposed simultanously. This procedure can be broken up into several steps, by imposing part of the attractor equations and substituting them back into the entropy function. If the resulting entropy function produces upon extremization the remaining attractor equations, one has found a new, reduced variational principle [\cite=CdWKM:2006]. This works, in particular, if one imposes the magnetic attractor equations in the first step, and this allows us to relate the variational principle of section [\ref=Sect:VarPri] to the work of Ooguri, Strominger and Vafa [\cite=OSV] on black hole partition functions and the topological string.

The magnetic attractor equations read [formula], and can be solved by setting

[formula]

The quantities [formula] are to be determined by the remaining, electric attractor equations. Looking at the gauge field equations of motion one realizes that the φI are, in the backgrounds under consideration, the electrostatic potentials (see for example [\cite=CdWKM:2000]). In thermodynamical terms this means that they are the chemical potentials dual to the electric charge. Substituting the magnetic attractor equations into the entropy function, one obtains the reduced entropy function

[formula]

where

[formula]

and YI = YI(p,φ) is given by ([\ref=solve_magnetic]). Variation of the reduced entropy function yields the electric attractor equations

[formula]

and at the critical point one finds

[formula]

which shows that the black hole entropy is obtained from the 'free energy' FOSV(p,φ) through a partial Legendre transform which replaces [formula] by qI as independent variable.

The interpretation of FOSV(p,φ) as a black hole free energy is strongly supported by the following observation [\cite=OSV]. The function F(YI,Υ), which encodes the R2-couplings together with the prepotential, is proportional to the (holomorphic) free energy Ftop of the topologically twisted type-II string. Taking into account conventional normalization factors, the precise relation is

[formula]

where Ztop is the (holomorphic) partition function of the topological string. This suggests to take the interpretation of FOSV(p,φ) as a black hole free energy seriously. Since this function depends on the magnetic charges pI and the electrostatic potentials φI, the free energy FOSV(p,φ) belongs to a mixed ensemble, where magnetic charges are treated microcanonically, whereas electric charges are treated canonically. The partition function for such an ensemble is

[formula]

where d(p,q) is the microscopic state degeneracy, i.e., the partition function of the microcanonical ensemble where both electric and magnetic charges are kept fixed. The two partition functions are related by a (discrete) Laplace transformation.

One can now formulated the OSV conjecture [\cite=OSV]

[formula]

where ≃ denotes asymptotic equality in the limit of large charges, which is the semi-classical limit. Thus the macroscopic quantity FOSV, which is determined by the couplings in the low energy effective action is directly related to the microscopic state degeneracy. Another, suggestive way to formulate the conjecture is [\cite=OSV]

[formula]

By only requiring asymptotic equality we have formulated a 'weak' version of the OSV conjecture [\cite=OSV]. Here asymptotic equality means equality order by order in an expansion in inverse charges, where the charges are taken to be uniformly large. Due to the homogenity properties of the prepotential, such an expansion is natural. The weak form of the conjecture has been tested successfully for 'large' black holes, while there are problems with the subleading terms for 'small' black holes. We will come back to this later.

An even more intriguing 'strong' version of the conjecture [\cite=OSV] asserts that ([\ref=Z=Z2]) can be extended to an exact equality, which might even provide a non-perturbative definition of the topological string in terms of black hole data [\cite=OSV] [\cite=DGNV]. As we will discuss below, the status of this version is much less clear. In any case the original conjecture needs to be amended. In particular, the holomorphic factorization ([\ref=Z=Z2]) cannot be exact.

Tests of the conjecture can be performed by either predicting the free energy FOSV(p,φ) from the microscopic state degeneracy d(p,q), or vice versa. For the latter method one formally inverts ([\ref=ZBH]) and expresses the state degeneracy through an inverse Laplace transformation:

[formula]

At this point we should mention several open questions. One point is that the sums and integrals appearing in ([\ref=ZBH]), ([\ref=InverseLaplace]) are given as formal expressions. The leading term in the integral ([\ref=InverseLaplace]) is a Gaussian integral associated to an indefinite quadratic form, which requires resummation or analytical continuation. The convergence of ([\ref=ZBH]), ([\ref=InverseLaplace]) and the proper choice of integration contours in ([\ref=InverseLaplace]) have not been investigated in much detail. Also note that φI appears as a complex variable in ([\ref=InverseLaplace]), while its physical values are real, which shows again that the definition of ([\ref=InverseLaplace]) involves an analytic continuation. These questions can be ignored as long as ([\ref=ZBH]), ([\ref=InverseLaplace]) are evaluated in saddle point approximation, but become relevant if one wants to go beyond this.

Another noteworthy point is that symplectic covariance (electric-magnetic duality) is not manifest in the OSV conjecture. Since stringy symmetries, such as S-duality and T-duality form a discrete subgroup of the symplectic rotations, one might be worried whether the conjecture is compatible with string dualities. A closely related point is the role of the so-called non-holomorphic corrections, to be discussed below. There we will formulate a manifestly duality invariant version of the OSV conjecture, which predicts the presence of a specific correction factor in ([\ref=ZBH]), ([\ref=InverseLaplace]).

There is also the question whether d(p,q) really is the absolute state degeneracy, or a weighted, index-like quantity. Here we should remember that we need to vary parameters to go from the string perturbative regime (state counting) to the effective gravity regime (black hole with event horizon). During the interpolation, BPS states might pair up into non-BPS states, or decay when crossing lines of marginal stability. Index-like quantities, like the elliptic genus, are at least insensitive to the first effect. Therefore it appears natural from the microscopic point of view that d(p,q) is an index [\cite=OSV]. However, entropy is normally related with the absolute state degeneracy. An extensive study of 'small' black holes in various N = 4 and N = 2 compactifications [\cite=DDMP1] [\cite=DDMP2] found that most cases are insensitive to the distinction between an indexed and an absolute degeneracy. However, for untwisted states in N = 2 orbifolds the OSV prediction for the state degeneracy agrees with the absolute degeneracy and disagrees with the exponentially smaller indexed degeneracy [\cite=DDMP2]. Related observations were reported and discussed in [\cite=Sen:0504]. Recently [\cite=DenMoo] have made an interesting proposal for resolving the problem: they suggest that the true degeneracy, when computed at finite coupling, is always counted by an appropriate index. This idea makes use of the fact that BPS states can become marginally stable and decay upon variation of the coupling.

Non-holomorphic corrections

So far, our discussion of N = 2 BPS black holes was based on the holomorphic function F(YI,Υ). This description is however incomplete. This is seen immediately when looking at explicit examples of black hole solutions. A particularly instructive class of examples is provided by compactifications with enhanced N = 4 supersymmetry. These can be described in terms of the N = 2 formalism used here. The function F(YI,Υ) takes the special form

[formula]

Here [formula], where n is the number of N = 2 vector multiplets. In heterotic N = 4 compactifications [formula] is the dilaton. Note that, in contrast to the R2-coupling F(1), the prepotential does not receive instanton corrections, and that all the higher coupling functions F(g)(YI), g > 1 vanish. Moreover S- and T-duality are believed to be exact symmetries in N = 4 compactifications. The heterotic dilaton S is inert under T-duality and transforms fractionally linear under S-duality

[formula]

It is then straightforward to show that the attractor equations and the black hole entropy can only be S-duality covariant if the function [formula] transforms with weight 2 [\cite=CdWM:9906]. But this is not possible if F(1)(S) is holomorphic. The only way to get an S-duality invariant entropy is to add non-holomorphic terms. Both the problem and its solution are variants of a well known phenomenon, which occurs generally in supersymmetric string effective field theories [\cite=DKL]. One has to distinguish between two types of couplings: the Wilsonian couplings are part of a local Wilsonian effective action. In supersymmetric theories this results in a holomorphic dependence on the moduli. However the Wilsonian couplings are different from the physical couplings which can be extracted from string scattering amplitudes. In particular, they do not transform covariantly under string dualities. In contrast, the physical couplings are duality covariant, but have a more complicated, non-holomorphic dependence on the moduli. They are related to a different type of effective action, the generating functional of one particle-irreducible graphs. If the theory contains massless particles, this type of action is in general non-local.

Since the black hole entropy is a physical quantity, it needs the full physical couplings as input. A systematic way of incorporating non-holomorphic corrections into the attractor equations, the variational principle and the black hole entropy was worked out in [\cite=CdWM:9906] [\cite=CdWKM:2004] [\cite=CdWKM:2006]. Basically, the modification amounts to the following replacement:

[formula]

where [formula] is a real-valued function which is homogenous of degree two. For concrete models this function has to be computed in string theory. Note that any harmonic part of Ω can be absorbed into F. In other words, 'non-holomorphic' corrections correspond to non-harmonic functions Ω.

The non-holomorphic contributions to the string effective action have their microscopic counterpart in the holomorphic anomaly of the topological type-II string [\cite=BCO]. Consequences of the holomorphic anomaly for the OSV conjecture have been discussed in [\cite=OSV] [\cite=DGNV] [\cite=Ver:2004] [\cite=SenNH]. Our 'macroscopic' approach, whose relation to these 'microscopic' approaches is not completely understood, takes the non-holomorphic corrections into account ab intio, and maintains manifest symplectic covariance and duality invariance throughout. This leads us to postulate a specific modified version of ([\ref=OSVconjecture]), which is based on the black hole variational principle of section [\ref=Sect:VarPri]. Consequently, we do not start from the mixed, but from the canonical ensemble and postulate that the black hole partition function is given by

[formula]

or, equivalently,

[formula]

Here the generalized Hesse potential H and the canonical free energy F include the non-harmonic function Ω. By an inverse Laplace transformation we can solve for the microstate degeneracy:

[formula]

where Σ is the entropy function and

[formula]

When expressing the integral in terms of the real variables xI,yI, the measure is just the natural symplectically invariant measure on NVM (proportional to the top exterior power of the symplectic form). Conversion to the complex variables YI results in a rather complicated measure factor. This shows that the real variables are conceptually more natural. However, in practice we only know the subleading corrections to Σ in terms of complex variables. Fortunately, the measure factor is subleading in the limit of large charges. The microscopic entropy is by definition the natural logarithm of the state degeneracy, while the macrocopic entropy is given by the saddle point value of the entropy function, Smacro(p,q)  =  πΣ*. If we evaluate ([\ref=StatesFromCan]) in saddle point approximation, we obtain the following relation:

[formula]

Here Δ+ is the fluctuation determinant of the Gaussian integral around the stationary point. Both entropies are different in general, as expected, since they correspond to different ensembles. Since the correction factors Δ± are subleading, they agree in the limit of large charges, which plays the role of the thermodynamic limit.

It is instructive to evaluate ([\ref=StatesFromCan]) in such a way that one can compare to the original OSV conjecture ([\ref=OSVconjecture]). The observation that the variational principle can be broken up into two steps can be used to perform a saddle point evaluation of ([\ref=StatesFromCan]) with respect to YI, which gives

[formula]

Here we denote the free energy in the mixed ensemble by FE instead of FOSV because we include the non-holomorphic corrections. After applying a discrete Laplace transform

[formula]

we can compare to the original OSV conjecture

[formula]

We see that imposing symplectic covariance has lead us to two modifications: we have an additional measure factor Δ-, and we have included the non-holomorphic corrections.

Large black holes

We now turn to tests of our conjectures ([\ref=OSVmodHesse])-([\ref=OSVmod]) about black hole partition functions. Here we concentrate on N = 4 compactifications, where exact S- and T-duality invariance and the vanishing of the higher coupling functions F(g), g > 1 leads to simplifications. In N = 4 compactifications there are two types of BPS states: [formula]-BPS states which carry both electric and magnetic charge and [formula] BPS states which are purely electric or purely magnetic. These correspond to large and to small black holes, respectively. In this section we consider [formula]-BPS states, for which the following formula for the state degeneracy has been conjectured [\cite=DVV] [\cite=SSY]:

[formula]

The integral is a three-fold contour integral in the so-called rank 2 Siegel upper half space, which can be representated as the space of complex, symmetric matrices with positive imaginary part,

[formula]

The function Φ10(ρ,σ,v) is the weight 10 Siegel cusp form, which generalizes the well-known discriminant function η24(ρ). p and q are the vectors of electric and magnetic charges, and p2,q2,p  ·  q are the three T-duality invariant scalars one can form out of them. Since these three T-duality invariants transform in a three-dimensional representation of the S-duality group [formula], the above expression for d(p,q) is formally S- and T-duality invariant, as it must be. Strong support for ([\ref=DVV]) has been given by various independent arguments, including derivations from the worldvolume theory of type-II NS5-brane [\cite=DVV] and from the D1-D5 bound state [\cite=SSY]. The formula also has been generalized to the so-called CHL models [\cite=CHL], which are N = 4 orbifolds, in [\cite=JatSen]. The microscopic formula ([\ref=DVV]) can be evaluated in a saddle point approximation. The result can then be compared to the macroscopic black hole entropy and to the black hole partition function, including subleading corrections [\cite=CdWKM:2004].

The key for handling the subleading corrections on the macroscopic side is the observation that for N = 4 compactifications there is a further reduction of the black hole variational principle [\cite=CdWM:98] [\cite=CdWKM:2006]. Due to the special structure of the prepotential, one can solve all but two attractor equations explicitly, for general values of the charges. The remaining two attractor equations then determine the value of the (heterotic) dilaton on the horizon. Substituting the solution back into the entropy function, one obtains the reduced entropy function

[formula]

Here we absorbed the holomorphic R2-couplings F(1) into the function Ω [formula] for convenience. Given the transformation properties of the charges and of the dilaton, Σ is a symplectic function, and the black hole entropy Smacro(p,q)  =  πΣ* is manifestly S- and T-duality invariant, for any S-duality invariant function Ω.

At the two-derivative level, which corresponds to Ω = 0, the BPS black hole entropy is

[formula]

[\cite=CveYou] [\cite=CveTse] [\cite=BerKalOrt], which agrees with the saddle point value of ([\ref=DVV]) [\cite=DVV]. For the simplest N = 4 compactification, which can be realized by compactifying the heterotic string on T6, Ω takes the form

[formula]

[\cite=HarMor:96]. Expansion of the Dedekind function

[formula]

shows that there is a tree-level R2-term, which receives an infinite series of instanton corrections. The integral ([\ref=DVV]) is evaluated in two steps. The v-integral is done by taking residues. It can be shown that for large dyonic charges one residue dominates, while all others are exponentially surpressed [\cite=DVV] [\cite=ShiYin]. After taking this leading residue, the ρ- and σ-integrals can be performed in saddle point approximation. It turns out that the saddle point equations for ρ and σ are precisely the two attractor equations for the dilaton, which remain after the other attractor equations have been solved [\cite=CdWKM:2004]. As a result macroscopic and microscopic entropy agree (the Δ± factors cancel, possibly up to subleading terms). This result is semi-classical, as it is obtained in saddle point approximation. However, the matching involves the full function Ω, including the infinite series of instanton corrections, which are exponentially surpressed for large charges [\cite=CdWKM:2004].

In order to draw conclusions about the OSV conjecture, one can proceed in a different way, following [\cite=ShiYin]. Namely, one can use the integral representation ([\ref=DVV]) for the state degeneracy to evaluate the mixed partition function [formula]. The result can be written in the following way

[formula]

The right hand side of this equation contains a sum over shifts in φ. This has to be included to match the manifest periodicity properties of the left hand side. The function in the exponent agrees exactly with the mixed ensemble black hole free energy

[formula]

including all R2- and nonholomorphic terms [\cite=CdWKM:2006]. Finally there is a non-trivial measure factor -, which agrees with our prediction ([\ref=OSVmod]) in the limit of large charges.

We can also connect our results to an observation made in [\cite=DavSen]. There it was shown that the microscopic state degeneracy for N = 4 compactifications can be brought to the form

[formula]

Both the function Σ̃ and the measure are manifestly S- and T-duality invariant. The function Σ̃ can be interpreted as a microscopic entropy function, i.e., as a microscopic analogue of the macroscopic entropy function used in the formalism of [\cite=SenEntropyFct]. The state degeneracy can be evaluated systematically by treating Σ̃ as a classical Lagrangian, adding a source term, and using Feynman diagram and background field techniques to evaluate the corresponding partition function [\cite=DavSen]. While the tree level evaluation corresponds to taking the saddle point value of the integral, the one loop level corresponds to the full saddle point evaluation, including the fluctuation determinant. We expect that at least in this approximation the result should agree with the one obtained from our macroscopic entropy function ([\ref=EntropyFunction]) (generalized to include R2- and non-holomorphic corrections [\cite=CdWKM:2006]). To show that this is indeed the case, we note that in the saddle point approximation Σ̃ takes the following form:

[formula]

which is manifestly S- and T-duality invariant. Here we converted a result of [\cite=DavSen] into our conventions. Constant terms and an infinite series of terms suppressed by negative powers of the charges have been neglected. Looking back to ([\ref=EntropyFunctionDilatonic]) and ([\ref=Omega4R2NH]), and taking into account that Υ*  =   - 64 we immediately see that

[formula]

where Σ is the reduced 'dilatonic' entropy function ([\ref=EntropyFunctionDilatonic]). * is the attractor value of the symplectic function [formula], where the 'hat' signals the inclusion of non-holomorphic terms. At the attractor point this quantity is proportional to the area [\cite=CdWKM:2000],

[formula]

The quantity [formula] is the leading term of the measure Δ- in the canonical partition function. In a saddle point approximation one can bring the partition function ([\ref=OSVmodFree]) to the following form, where all but two integrations have been performed:.

[formula]

which agrees with the microscopic formula ([\ref=MicroEntro]). Thus in a saddle point approximation the microscopic entropy function of [\cite=DavSen] can be matched macroscopically by absorbing the measure factor into the reduced dilatonic entropy function, which includes R2 and non-holomorphic corrections.

The tests described in this section provide strong evidence that our proposed modifications of the OSV conjecture are correct in the semi-classical limit. Note that while we displayed explicit results specifically for toroidal heterotic compactifications, the same tests are passed successfully by CHL models [\cite=CdWKM:2006]. This generalisation relies on the explicit results on CHL models obtained in [\cite=JatSen]. The presence of a measure factor in the OSV formula has been established beyond doubt [\cite=ShiYin] [\cite=CdWKM:2006]. Note, however, that the explicit measure factor that we propose has so far only been tested in the saddle point approximation. In view of the intricate nature of further corrections it is possible, in fact even quite likely that this is not the full story.

Small black holes

Due to lack of space we only discuss the situation concerning small black holes very briefly. A more detailed discussion can be found in [\cite=DDMP1] [\cite=DDMP2] and in [\cite=CdWKM:2006]. While many more examples have been studied in [\cite=DDMP1] [\cite=DDMP2], we consider the simplest case, electric black holes in toroidal compactifications of the heterotic string, which serves us well to explain what we consider to be the main problem. These black holes are expected to be in one-to-one correspondence with the [formula]-BPS states of the perturbative heterotic string, known as Dabholkar-Harvey states [\cite=DabHar]. The problem of computing the state degeneracy is formally equivalent to (a version of) the classical problem of counting partitions of integers, which was studied by Hardy and Ramanujan, and which can be solved using a technique developed by Rademacher [\cite=Rademacher]. Therefore this is an ideal case for precision tests of the OSV conjecture [\cite=Dabholkar]. Using the Rademacher expansion, the microscopic entropy is (see for example [\cite=FareyTail1]):

[formula]

Here q2 is the T-duality invariant norm of the vector [formula] of electric charges, and Î13 is a modified Bessel function. The Rademacher expansion contains an infinite series of further Bessel functions, which are exponentially surpressed for large charges. We also have made explicit the first two terms in the asymptotic expansion of the leading Bessel function. There is an infinite series of further terms involving inverse powers of the charges, see for example [\cite=DDMP2]. In [\cite=DDMP2] the prediction of the unmodified OSV conjecture for the state degeneracy was found to be

[formula]

Here 'unmodified OSV conjecture' means that the integral ([\ref=InverseLaplace]) was evaluated without a measure factor and without including non-holomorphic terms. This result matches the leading terms and almost matches infinitely many subleading terms. However, the prefactor (p1)2 spoils T-duality and leads to a mismatch of the subleading terms. Moreover, in order to get a Bessel function with the correct index 13, one needs to truncate the OSV integral from 28 to 24 integrations [\cite=DDMP2]. The failure of T-duality suggests the presence of a measure factor in the OSV integral [\cite=DDMP2]. When evaluating the modified OSV integral ([\ref=StatesFromMod]), which includes a measure factor and the non-holomorphic terms, one finds [\cite=CdWKM:2006]:

[formula]

This is manifestly T-duality invariant, and the OSV integral involves the full set of 28 integrations, as in the dyonic case. However, a contribution from the measure shifts the index of the Bessel function, which results in a systematic mismatch of infinitely many subleading terms encoded in the leading Bessel function. This is puzzling. Moreover, the structure of the exponentially surpressed terms seen in any version of the OSV conjecture is completely different from the one appearing in microscopic state counting [\cite=DDMP2] [\cite=CdWKM:2006].

As a result the status of the OSV conjecture for electric black holes is unclear. Only the leading term matches quantitatively. One obvious reason for the problem is that in the limit of large charges the (would-be) leading contribution to the entropy and to the measure factor vanishes. Thus the starting point of the expanison is ill defined. One might still hope to find an improved expansion which leads to a matching for the inverse power corrections. Exponentially surpressed corrections, if they can be made work at all, seem to require a drastic modification.

Why [formula].

While it was clear from the beginning that the relation ZBH  =  |Ztop|2, with Ztop being holomorphic, cannot be literally true due to existence of non-holomorphic corrections [\cite=OSV], this is not always appreciated. From the macroscopic perspective the non-holomorphic contributions reflect that the black hole partition function is a physical quantity, because it encodes state degeneracies. Therefore it must be related to the 'physical' rather than the 'Wilsonian' couplings. In fact, the structure to be expected is familiar from supersymmetric mass formulae of the form M2  =  eK|W|2, which involve the square of a holomorphic object (the superpotential W, evaluated at its minimum) together with a non-holomorphic factor, the exponentiated Kähler potential. Therefore the presence of a non-holomorphic measure factor is not surprising. What is less clear is how this factor can be understood microscopically.

Recently, there has been progress in understanding the subleading microscopic contributions to the entropy of N = 2 black holes, by combining various ingredients such as the the AdS3 / CFT2 correspondence, the elliptic genus, and generalizations of the Rademacher expansion. In particular, a microscopic explanation has been found why ZBH≃|Ztop|2 in the limit of large charges [\cite=GSY:06] [\cite=KraLar:2006] [\cite=BGGHSY] [\cite=dBCDMV]: the asymptotic factorization reflects that the entropy receives contributions from both branes and anti-branes, which do not couple to leading order. Therefore the breakdown of holomorphic factorization should result from a breakdown of decoupling. Most recently, the refined analysis performed in [\cite=DenMoo] has indeed identified a microscopic measure factor, which agrees, in the semiclassical limit, with the factor found in [\cite=ShiYin] [\cite=CdWKM:2006].

Concluding remarks

Supersymmetric black holes and their role in string theory have been a topic of tremendous interest and activity over the last years. This overview could not do justice to all aspects of this field, and it has been biased in stressing the macroscopic or supergravity perspective. A good introduction to the microscopic aspects is included in the nice set of lecture notes [\cite=Pioline], while [\cite=Kraus] reviews the AdS3 / CFT2 perspective. We have tried to be complete at least in our discussion of open questions and problems, since we believe that this will continue to be an exciting topic of research for years to come.
