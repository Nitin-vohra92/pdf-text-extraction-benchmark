Plasma: the genesis of the word

Michel Foucault wrote that objects and words intercross deeply, and Nature only offer herself to our understanding through words; without the right words, Nature will subsume in a fading light [\cite=Foucault]. This reasoning pushed us to recall how the "fourth state of matter" was denominated. We believe that understanding the genealogy of the word will throw some light to its roots, the content and philosophy of this science.

In fact, the word plasma comes from the Greek (πλασμα) and means "to mold", "to shape". Jan Evangelista Purkyn (1787-1869), a notable Czech medical scientist (best known for his discovery of Purkinje cells), used for the first time this word to designate the reminescent translucid liquid that remains after completely removing the blood from all the corpuscules (he also introduced the word protoplasm for the substance inside the cell).

Faraday pointed out that matter can be classified in four states: solid, liquid, gas, and radiant (in his own words). The research on this new form of matter was initiated by Heinrich Geiβler (1814-1879), a glassblower, who invented the sealed glass tube (now called Geiβler tube). Julius Plücker (1801-1868), while professor at Bonn, published his results about the action of the magnet on the electric discharge in rarefied gases. With his pupil Johann Wilhelm Hittorf (1824-1914) he made many important discoveries in the spectroscopy of gases [\cite=Hittorf] [\cite=Tomaschek].

Later on Sir William Crookes took again the term "radiant matter" coined by Faraday, to designate this new "form" of matter. In his own words:

�So distinct are these phenomena from anything which occurs in air or gas at ordinary tension, that we are led to assume that we are here brought face to face with matter in a fourth state or condition, a condition as far removed from the state of gas as a gas is from a liquid.� [\cite=Crookes_1].

The invention of the radiometer by Crookes lead him to the study of rarefied gases and, in particular, to study electric discharges in rarefied gases. This new line of research was open by the discovery of cathode rays by Wilhelm Hittorf in 1869. According to Crookes cathode rays were a kind of matter in the ultra-gaseous state, emitted by the cathode and had the dimensions of molecules. They were invisible but could be turned perceptible by the phosphorescence that they induce on the walls of the glass tube or by the shadows left behind by objects placed along their paths.

The researches done by Plücker, Hittorf and Crookes constitute the first fundamental observations of new phenomena that led to the new discipline of glow discharge plasma, dedicated to the study of a very complex non-equilibrium plasma. A voltage were applied across two electrodes placed inside in an optically transparent vacuum envelope (with a pressure of the order of a few torr), usually made of pyrex glass or quartz. The region near the cathode was later on called the Hittorf-Crookes dark space; dark because the electrons density is not enough to ionize the gas.

But experiments done in 1881 by J. J. Thomson have shown later that this "radiant matter" were in fact constituted by electrified corpuscules that were later named electrons (a term coined by Johnstone Stoney [\cite=Stoney_1]), the separate units of electricity, and that theory was abandoned.

It is quite interesting to notice that some esoteric notions used by Crookes were possibly at the historical root of the word plasma. The same pre-logical formulations were present at the genesis of Newton's mechanics, endowing the gravitic force with esoteric properties:

This most beautiful system of the sun, planets, and comets, could only proceed from the counsel and dominion of an intelligent and power Being." [\cite=Newton_1].

But the word plasma may possibly had a previous meaning related to phantoms, ghosts and others interests pursued on by Sir William Crookes, and that ultimately led some people to denounce him as a not honest, or lucid, scientist. Let's cite just a small paragraph of his 1883 Bakerian Lecture given to the Royal Society of London:

No Will-o'-the-Wisp ever led the unwary traveller into so many pitfalls and sloughs of despond as the hunt for this phantom band had entrapped me." [\cite=Crookes_2]

Of course, we know that his open-mindedness lead him to investigate psychic phenomena with several famous spiritual mediums. But this fact does not undermine the great achievements done by this great man of science, that ultimately made the first experimental observations of new phenomena and build the grounds of this new area of scientific research, known as plasma science. Among his achievements we can refer the invention of the spinthariscope, a remarkable particle's detector using a zinc sulfide screen to detect alpha particles, and the study of radioactive materials. And the nowadays wonderful toy, the Crookes radiometer, which ultimately gave one of the first evidence of the existence of atoms and supported the kinetic theory of gases.

Francis Chen in his renowned book on plasma science advances with a meaning which contains some weird suggestion:

"The word 'plasma' seems to be a misnomer. It comes from the Greek πλασμα, -ατoς, τó, which means something molded or fabricated. Because of collective behavior, it often behaves as if it had a mind of its own" [\cite=Chen_1].

However, the use of this term to describe an ionized gas in a written paper is due to the Nobel prize winning American chemist Irving Langmuir (1881-1957) in 1928 [\cite=Langmuir1]. It seems that Langmuir was reminded of the way blood plasma carries red and white corpuscles in a way that somehow similar to an electrified fluid carrying electrons and ions [\cite=Tonks_1].

This short note intended to recall the origin of the word and the pre-logical epistemological viewpoint sustaining at its beginning the actual branch of plasmas science.
