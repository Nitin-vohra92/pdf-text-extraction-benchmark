Remark

Hadamard matrices of order 764 exist

2000 Mathematics Subject Classification

Recall that a Hadamard matrix of order m is a [formula]-matrix A of size m  ×  m such that AAT = mIm, where T denotes the transpose and Im the identity matrix. We refer the reader to one of [\cite=KH] [\cite=SY] for the survey of known results about Hadamard matrices.

In our previous note [\cite=DZ], written about 13 years ago, we listed 17 integers [formula] for which no Hadamard matrix of order 4n was known at that time. Two of these integers were removed in that note and the smallest one, n = 107, was removed recently by Kharaghani and Tayfeh-Rezaie [\cite=KT]. Among the remaining 14 integers n only four are less than 1000. The problem of existence of Hadamard matrices of these four orders, namely 668, 716, 764 and 892, has been singled out as Research Problem 7 in the recent book [\cite=KH] by Kathy Horadam. In this note we shall remove the integer 764 from the mentioned list by constructing two examples of Hadamard matrices of Goethals-Seidel type of that order. (We have constructed a bunch of examples but we shall present only two of them.) Consequently, the revised list now consists of 13 integers:

[formula]

all of them primes congruent to 3 mod 4.

For the remainder of this note we set n = 191. Let G be the multiplicative group of non-zero residue classes modulo the prime n = 191, a cyclic group of order n - 1 = 190, and let H = 〈39〉  =  {1,39,184,109,49} be its subgroup of order 5. We choose the enumeration of the 38 cosets αi, 0  ≤  i  ≤  37, of H in G so that α2i + 1 =  - 1  ·  α2i for 0  ≤  i  ≤  18 and

[formula]

Define four index sets:

[formula]

and introduce the following four sets of integers modulo 191:

[formula]

Their cardinals nk = |Sk| = 5|Jk| are:

[formula]

and we set

[formula]

For [formula] let λk(r) denote the number of solutions of the congruence [formula] with {i,j}  ⊆  Sk. It is easy to verify (by using a computer) that

[formula]

is valid for all such r. Hence the sets S1,S2,S3,S4 are supplementary difference sets (SDS), with associated decomposition

[formula]

Let Ak be the n  ×  n circulant matrix with first row

[formula]

where ak,j =  - 1 if j∈Sk and ak,j = 1 otherwise. These [formula]-matrices satisfy the identity

[formula]

One can now plug in the matrices Ak into the Goethals-Seidel array to obtain a Hadamard matrix of order 4n = 764.

Our second example is constructed in the same way by using the index sets:

[formula]

The two solutions are not equivalent in the sense that the two SDS's are not equivalent. (For the definition of equivalence for SDS's see our note [\cite=DZ].)
