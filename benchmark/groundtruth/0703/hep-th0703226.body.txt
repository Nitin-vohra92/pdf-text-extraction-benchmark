Spectrum of local boundary operators from boundary form factor bootstrap

1E�tv�s University, Budapest, Hungary 2Theoretical Physics Research Group of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences

Introduction

The bootstrap program aims to classify and explicitly solve 1+1 dimensional integrable quantum field theories by constructing all of their Wightman functions. For bulk theories, the first stage is the S-matrix bootstrap: the scattering matrix, connecting asymptotic in and out states, is determined from its properties such as factorizability, unitarity, crossing symmetry and the Yang-Baxter equation supplemented by the maximal analyticity assumption which results in the complete on-shell solution of the theory, i.e. the spectrum of excitations and their scattering amplitudes (for reviews see [\cite=Sbstr] [\cite=Sanal]). The second step is the form factor bootstrap, which allows one to determine matrix elements of local operators between asymptotic states (form factors) using their analytic properties originating from the already known S-matrix. The form factors are then used to build the correlation (Wightman) functions via their spectral representations, yielding a complete off-shell description of the theory (see [\cite=Smirnov] for a review).

The first step of an analogous bootstrap program for 1+1 dimensional integrable boundary quantum field theories, the boundary R-matrix bootstrap, was developed in the pioneering work by Ghoshal and Zamolodchikov [\cite=GZ]; it makes possible the determination of the reflection matrices and provides complete description of the theory on the mass shell.

For the second step matrix elements of local operators between asymptotic states have to be computed. In a boundary quantum field theory there are two types of operators, the bulk and the boundary operators, where their names indicate their localization point. The boundary bootstrap program, namely the boundary form factor program for calculating the matrix elements of local boundary operators between asymptotic states was initiated in [\cite=bffprogram].

In this work we make further progress in understanding the boundary form factor bootstrap by classifying and counting the solutions. In the bulk case it was proposed by Cardy and Mussardo that the space of solutions of form factor axioms is to be identified with the space of local operators [\cite=cardy_mussardo]. The program of counting the solutions was performed for several interesting models [\cite=koubek_mussardo] [\cite=koubek1] [\cite=koubek2] [\cite=smirnovcounting] and it was shown that the results agree with the spectrum of local operators expected from the Lagrangian description in terms of the ultraviolet limiting conformal field theory. Here we take the models treated in [\cite=bffprogram] and perform a similar counting of solutions, which can then be brought into correspondence with the spectrum of boundary operators predicted by boundary conformal field theory.

The outline of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we give a short overview of the boundary form factor axioms and also introduce some basic notions concerning form factor solutions. In Section 3 we investigate the scaling Lee-Yang model with boundary, which has two physically inequivalent boundary conditions. We start with the simpler boundary condition (denoted by [formula]) and develop all the concepts necessary to perform the counting of the form factor solutions. Then we apply these to the other boundary condition (denoted by Φ) too, while in Section 4 we treat the boundary sinh-Gordon model using the same tools. We give our conclusions and discuss major open problems in Section 5.

The boundary form factor bootstrap and the classification of solutions

The boundary form factor axioms

The axioms satisfied by the form factors of a local boundary operator were derived in [\cite=bffprogram]. Here we only list them without much further explanation. Let us suppose that we treat an integrable boundary quantum field theory in the domain x < 0, with a single scalar particle of mass m, which has a two-particle S matrix S(θ) (using the standard rapidity parametrization) and a one-particle reflection factor R(θ) off the boundary, satisfying the boundary reflection factor bootstrap conditions of Ghoshal and Zamolodchikov [\cite=GZ]. For a local operator O(t) localized at the boundary (located at x = 0, and parameterized by the time coordinate t) the form factors are defined as

[formula]

for [formula] and [formula], using the asymptotic in / out state formalism introduced in [\cite=BBT]. They can be extended analytically to other values of rapidities. With the help of the crossing relations derived in [\cite=bffprogram] all form factors can be expressed in terms of the elementary form factors

[formula]

which can be shown to satisfy the following axioms:

I. Permutation:

[formula]

II. Reflection:

[formula]

III. Crossing reflection:

[formula]

IV. Kinematical singularity

[formula]

or equivalently described as

[formula]

V. Boundary kinematical singularity

[formula]

where g is the one-particle coupling to the boundary

[formula]

VI. Bulk dynamical singularity

[formula]

corresponding to a bound state pole of the S matrix

[formula]

(in a theory with a single particle, the only possible value is u = π / 3).

VII. Boundary dynamical singularity

[formula]

which corresponds to a pole in the reflection factor describing a boundary excited state:

[formula]

We further assume maximum analyticity i.e. that the form factors have only the minimal singularity structure consistent with the above axioms.

Solution of the axioms

The general Ansatz

The general form factor solution can be written in the following form [\cite=bffprogram]

[formula]

where f is the minimal bulk two-particle form factor (2PFF) satisfying the conditions

[formula]

and having the minimum possible number of singularities in the physical strip 0  ≤  θ  <  π together with the slowest possible growth at infinity [\cite=KW], and r is the minimal boundary one-particle form factor (1PFF) satisfying

[formula]

plus analytic conditions similar to those of f, but in this case in the strip 0  ≤  θ  <  π / 2.

The functions Gn are totally symmetric and meromorphic in the rapidities θi. They are also even and periodic in them with the period 2πi, so they can only be functions of the variables

[formula]

Let us now turn to the analysis of the singularity structure. In a theory with only one particle, the only possible singularity of the S matrix in the physical strip is located at θ = 2πi / 3 corresponding to the self-fusion of the particle (plus the crossed channel pole for the same process at πi / 3) and the relevant fusion coupling is defined as

[formula]

We suppose that the 2PFF function f is chosen such that it has a pole at θ = 2πi / 3 so that it encodes this singularity (for an example see ([\ref=eq:min2pffly])). We further assume that the boundary dynamical singularities (but not the kinematical ones!) are similarly contained in the 1PFF function r. Then the functions Gn only have singularities at the positions of the kinematical singularities, and so they can be written in the form

[formula]

where the Qn are entire functions symmetric in their arguments.

Two-point functions and scaling weights

The two-point functions can be written using a spectral representation:

[formula]

where time translation invariance was used and the form factors Fn, F+n are defined as

[formula]

and

[formula]

which, for unitary theories, is the complex conjugate of the previous one: F+n = F*n. In the Euclidean time τ = it the form factor expansion of the correlator converges rapidly for large separations since multi-particle terms are exponentially suppressed.

We are interested in operators which can be classified according to their scaling dimensions, which means that the two-point function must have a power-like short-distance singularity

[formula]

where Δ is an exponent determined by the ultraviolet scaling weights of the local fields. More precisely let us consider the conformal operator product expansion

[formula]

where h is the ultraviolet weight of the field O and the hi are the weight of the Oi. It is obvious that

[formula]

where [formula] is the minimum of the weights of the operators appearing in the expansion. In many cases it is [formula] (corresponding to the weight of the identity) and then h and Δ are identical.

It is well-known that the presence of a power-like singularity means that the form factors themselves can only grow exponentially in the rapidity variables [\cite=delfino_mussardo] and so the functions Qn are symmetric polynomials in the variables yi. The singularity axioms give recursion relations for the polynomials Qn, for which we introduce the abbreviated notation

[formula]

where K, D and B denote the recursion relation resulting from the bulk kinematical, bulk dynamical and boundary kinematical singularity axioms respectively. We give explicit forms of these relations for specific models later.

If the form factors grow asymptotically as

[formula]

(where we assume that the exponent x is independent of the level n) then the leading short-distance behaviour of the individual terms can be easily shown to be 1 / τ2x and so naively Δ = x. In fact, leading logarithmic corrections in τ can (and in many cases do) sum up to an anomalous contribution to the ultraviolet exponent Δ and therefore we call x the naive (or engineering) dimension of the form factor solution.

Towers and local operators

Following the ideas in the work of Koubek and Mussardo on classification of the bulk form factor solutions [\cite=koubek_mussardo], the set of elementary form factors corresponding to a local operator forms a tower of form factors, graded by the number of particles:

[formula]

Due to the recursion relations ([\ref=eq:genrecrel]) the solutions ([\ref=eq:GenAnsatz])

[formula]

of the form factor equations can also be classified into towers which consist of a single form factor at each level n such that the solutions at different levels are linked together via the relations ([\ref=eq:genrecrel]). As we show later in the explicit examples, the recursion relations are such that the naive scaling dimension x is independent of the level n and therefore it can be assigned to the tower itself. Therefore the space of form factor solutions can be rearranged into a space of towers T, which can in turn be graded by the naive scaling dimension. Due to the linearity of the form factor axioms, the space of towers is a linear space i.e. whenever [formula]and [formula] are two towers, so is their general linear combination

[formula]

While the space of towers (T) is always infinite dimensional, the subspaces corresponding to a given value of x can be finite dimensional; in that case it makes sense to count the towers graded by x. We can introduce the character of this space by

[formula]

where dx is the linear dimension of those towers which have naive dimension x.

The space L of scaling local boundary operators is also a graded linear space, where the grading is given by the ultraviolet scaling weight Δ. The character of that space can be obtained from boundary conformal field theory. Our aim here is to bring the two graded spaces into correspondence with each other via comparing their characters, which is actually nothing else than the counting of linearly independent local operators classified by their ultraviolet scaling behaviour.

Scaling Lee-Yang model with boundary

The scaling Lee-Yang model with boundary is a combined bulk and boundary perturbation of the boundary version of the M2,5 Virasoro minimal model which was investigated in detail in [\cite=DPTW1]. The conformal field theory has central charge c =  - 22 / 5 and the Virasoro algebra has two irreducible representations Vh with highest weight h = h1,1 = 0 and h = h1,2 =  - 1 / 5 [\cite=lycft]. We define the truncated characters of these representations by

[formula]

where d(n) gives the degeneracy of the level n descendents. They can be represented as the following fermionic sums [\cite=fermchars]

[formula]

Boundary conformal field theory was developed in [\cite=cardybcft] [\cite=bulkboundaryope] [\cite=sewing] and the interested reader is referred to them for details. Applying the formalism to the conformal Lee-Yang model it can be seen that there are two conformally invariant boundary conditions. On one of them, denoted by [formula] in [\cite=DPTW1], the spectrum of boundary fields is given by the vacuum representation V0 of the Virasoro algebra, and therefore it does not have any relevant boundary fields - thus can have no boundary perturbation either. In the other case, denoted Φ in [\cite=DPTW1], the spectrum of boundary fields is given by the direct sum [formula] and therefore it has a nontrivial relevant boundary field φ with scaling dimension - 1 / 5 and the general perturbed boundary conformal field theory action can be written as

[formula]

where AΦ denotes the action for M(2 / 5) with the Φ boundary condition imposed at x = 0, and μ and μB denote the bulk and boundary couplings respectively. There is a unique nontrivial relevant bulk perturbation given by the spinless field φ with scaling dimensions h =  =  - 1 / 5. The action of Aλ,1 is similar, but the last term on the right hand side is missing. For μ > 0 the bulk behaviour is described by an integrable massive theory having only a single particle with mass m with the following S matrix [\cite=CM]:

[formula]

The pole at [formula] corresponds to the "φ3 property", i.e. the particle appears as a bound state of itself. The minimal bulk two-particle form factor only has a zero at θ = 0 and a pole at [formula] in the strip [formula] and is of the form [\cite=Z1]:

[formula]

where

[formula]

and it satisfies

[formula]

and consequently also f(θ)  ~  O(1) for large θ.

In the boundary theory with the perturbed Φ boundary, the reflection amplitude of the particle depends on the strength of the coupling constant of the boundary field as [\cite=DPTW1]

[formula]

with the one-particle coupling

[formula]

where the relation between the dimensionless bootstrap parameter b and the dimensionful Lagrangian parameters μ and μB is known explicitely [\cite=dtwgfunct], while in the case of the [formula] boundary the reflection amplitude is the parameter independent expression

[formula]

and the one-particle coupling is

[formula]

Counting towers for the boundary condition [formula]

The recursive equations for the form factors

The 1PFF function corresponding to the parameter free reflection factor R(θ)1 is

[formula]

where

[formula]

and asymptotically behaves as [formula] when θ  →    ∞  . Following the general ideas in 2.2.1 we introduce the Ansatz

[formula]

where

[formula]

Then one finds the following recursion equations for the Qn-s [\cite=bffprogram]:

[formula]

where

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

with the auxiliary variable z defined as a solution of y = z + z- 1 (i.e. writing y = 2 cosh θ we obtain [formula]). The symmetry of the expressions ([\ref=eq:ylrecrel1], [\ref=eq:Pequ]) in y± ensures that the resulting relations do not depend on which of the two possible solutions of the relation y = z + z- 1 is chosen (switching from [formula] to [formula] only interchanges y+ with y-).

Note also that [formula] only depends on y rather than separately on y± because due to its symmetry in all variables it can only depend on the combinations y+ + y- = y and y+y- = y2 - 3. Furthermore it is easy to see that Pn is a polynomial in all of its variables (since the expression inside the parentheses vanishes if y+ = y- and is therefore divisible by y+ - y-), and using the previous argument again it only depends on y. However, elimination of y± makes the formulae rather cumbersome and therefore we prefer to keep them in our equations.

It is also interesting to note that the boundary kinematical recursion is actually "almost" entirely contained in the bulk recursion. Using the bulk kinematical recursion with y = 0 results in

[formula]

while using the boundary kinematical recursion twice leads to

[formula]

and therefore it must be true that

[formula]

which is indeed satisfied by the expression ([\ref=eq:Pequ], [\ref=eq:Bequ]). This means that the "square" of the boundary kinematical recursion is contained in the bulk one, as already discussed in [\cite=bffprogram]. The only independent information that the boundary kinematical singularity axiom carries is the sign of the one-particle coupling g: all the other axioms depend only on the one-particle reflection factor R, which in turn contains only g2 using eqn. ([\ref=eq:gdef]).

Indeed it was shown by Dorey, Tateo and Watts in [\cite=DTWbct] that although the fundamental reflection factors of the boundary condition [formula] and Φ(b = 0) are identical, these boundary conditions are physically different. Their one-particle couplings differ by a sign

[formula]

and, as a result the whole bootstrap structure changes: the [formula] boundary condition has no boundary excited state, while the Φ(b = 0) does. This is also reflected in the different expression for their 1PFF function r as discussed after eqn. ([\ref=eq:1pffphi]). We note that while the sign of g is not manifest in the reflection factor itself, it affects many physical quantities besides the spectrum such as finite size corrections to the energy levels [\cite=DPTW1] [\cite=BLusch] and one-point functions of the bulk fields [\cite=DPTW1pt] [\cite=bstate].

Asymptotic behaviour of form factors and simple towers

It can be easily deduced that the asymptotic behaviour of the Ansatz ([\ref=Ansatz1]) is given by

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the total degree of the multivariable polynomial P defined by

[formula]

Note that

[formula]

As a result, the solutions of the recursion relation can be expanded in the basis of simple towers which are defined to be towers with the property

[formula]

for some [formula].

For a simple tower the exponent xn describing the asymptotic growth of the form factor tower is independent of the level n. Therefore we can use the naive dimension to introduce a grading on the space of towers: the subspace of towers of grade x is spanned by the simple towers with naive scaling dimension x. For a simple tower given by the polynomials [formula] the scaling dimension can be expressed as

[formula]

The recursion kernel and the number of independent towers

Here we carry over an approach developed by Koubek [\cite=koubek1] [\cite=koubek2] to count solutions of the bulk form factor equations to the boundary case. The idea is to classify the so-called 'kernels' of the recursion relations ([\ref=eq:genrecrel]) first and use these to get the dimensions of the spaces of simple towers.

The kernel can be defined as polynomials (at a given level n) that are taken to zero by the appropriate recursion relation in ([\ref=eq:genrecrel]). The kernel of each recursion at level n can be generated by multiplying an elementary kernel polynomial with an arbitrary symmetric polynomial of n variables. The generating polynomials are

[formula]

The common kernel of the three recursions at level n is generated by the least common multiple of these polynomials which is just equal to their product:

[formula]

with degree

[formula]

and a basis of the kernel polynomials at level n is given by

[formula]

where σ(n)k are the elementary symmetric polynomials of n variables and degree k defined by the generating relation

[formula]

The number of linearly independent towers can be counted using the observation that every independent tower starts from a kernel polynomial, because each new tower appears at some level (number of particles) n as an ambiguity of the solution of the recursion relations. This is true even for the towers starting at the lowest level n = 1 if we note that the kernel at level 1 is generated by

[formula]

The naive scaling dimension of the simple tower starting from the polynomial [formula] is

[formula]

Now we can write down the generating function X(q) defined in ([\ref=eq:towercharacter]) easily:

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the number of partitions of the number m such that none of the summands is greater than n. Using the identity

[formula]

we obtain

[formula]

and with the help of a Rogers-Ramanujan identity (following [\cite=koubek2])

[formula]

using ([\ref=eq:trunclychars]). Therefore the result of the counting of the form factor towers, graded by their naive scaling dimension, exactly matches the conformal spectrum of the operators localized on the [formula] boundary, which is given by the vacuum representation of the Virasoro algebra (with highest weight h1,1 = 0). The subtraction - 1 corresponds to the identity operator which only has trivial (vanishing) form factors.

Note that in claiming the agreement we tacitly supposed that the naive scaling dimension x of the towers can be identified directly with the conformal weights of the scaling operators, i.e. that there are no anomalous dimensions. This was checked for the form factor tower with the lowest possible dimension x = 2 in [\cite=bffprogram], where performing the spectral sum we obtained that the ultraviolet dimension of the corresponding operator was indeed Δ = 2.

Some explicit solutions

Finally we give the explicit forms of the lowest levels of some form factor towers. The n = 1 generating kernel polynomial is K1  =  σ1, and all kernel polynomials can simply be written as σn1. The first three towers starting at level 1 are

[formula]

The upper index T shows that the tower corresponds to the (off-critical version of the) boundary stress-energy operator [formula] (already found in [\cite=bffprogram]), while the other towers are its first and second derivatives respectively. In fact, there is a single tower for each value of x less than 6 which corresponds to the fact that up to this level (due to the presence of null-vectors) the conformal vacuum representation of the c =  - 22 / 5 Virasoro algebra contains only the vectors [formula] (n = 0,  1,  2,  3). At x = 6 the conformal representation contains another linearly independent vector, and indeed a new tower appears, which starts from the level 2 generating kernel polynomial:

[formula]

The counting argument in the last subsection ensures that the new towers always appear in such a way that the space of simple towers graded by x matches the space of linearly independent vectors in the vacuum representation.

Counting towers for the boundary condition Φ

In this case the 1PFF is [\cite=bffprogram]

[formula]

The main difference from the [formula] case is the presence of the denominators, which correspond to boundary excited states. Note that at b = 0 the reflection factor R(θ)Φ is identical to R(θ)1, but the corresponding 1PFFs are different. This is related to the different interpretation of the pole structure of the R matrices discussed in detail in [\cite=DTWbct]: for the boundary condition [formula] the boundary excited state is absent and the corresponding pole at [formula] is explained by a Coleman-Thun diagram. In this case we take the following Ansatz

[formula]

The recursion relations in this case are [\cite=bffprogram]

[formula]

where Pn and Bn are given by eqns. ([\ref=eq:Pequ], [\ref=eq:Bequ], [\ref=eq:ypmeq]) and

[formula]

The bulk and boundary kinematical recursions again satisfy the appropriate generalization of the compatibility relation ([\ref=eq:PBrelation]).

For the degrees of the recursions we have

[formula]

and so simple towers can now be defined by the property

[formula]

Due to the additional factors in the denominator the asymptotic behaviour of rΦ(θ) for θ  →    ∞   is O(1), and so the naive scaling dimension of a simple tower corresponding to the polynomials [formula] is

[formula]

The kernel is generated by the same polynomials as before, but now the naive scaling dimension corresponding to [formula] is

[formula]

and as a result we obtain

[formula]

using again a Rogers-Ramanujan identity following [\cite=koubek2]. This is consistent with the fact that in the conformal limit the boundary operator content of the Φ boundary condition is given by the direct sum of the vacuum module with highest weight h1,1 = 0 and the only other nontrivial representation with highest weight h1,2 =  - 1 / 5.

Note that in this case to achieve the agreement we must suppose that the naive scaling dimensions of the towers corresponding to operators of the identity representation do not get any anomalous corrections, while those corresponding to operators in the model with highest weight h1,2 =  - 1 / 5 get exactly the right contribution for their conformal weight to match with that predicted by conformal field theory. The true scaling weight of the operator can only be computed by examining appropriate two-point functions. This makes the operator identification very difficult for higher levels as shown below using the example of the boundary stress-energy tensor.

For x = 0 the operator identification is easy, since there is a unique tower with the required asymptotic properties:

[formula]

In [\cite=bffprogram] the two-point function of this tower was compared to the perturbed conformal field theory prediction and we found that its identification with the operator φ is justified (this also settles the case for all the derivatives of φ). We remark that the anomalous dimension of the correlator in this case turns out to be

[formula]

which is due to the fact that φ itself appears in the φφ operator product, and so the above result is in accordance with the discussion under 2.2.2 since [formula] (cf. also [\cite=bffprogram] and also the analogous bulk situation discussed by Zamolodchikov in [\cite=Z1]). For x = 1 there is again a single operator

[formula]

whose scaling dimension can be known exactly in terms of the scaling dimensions of the lowest tower, since it is a derivative operator. However, we find two towers at x = 2. One is the second derivative

[formula]

while the other one starts from the n = 2 generating kernel polynomial:

[formula]

which is consistent with the fact that both the Virasoro module [formula] and the module h = 0 have a single linearly independent vector at level two: L2- 1φ and [formula], respectively. The tower ([\ref=eq:d2phi]) can be directly identified with L2- 1φ since the action of L- 1 is exactly given by the derivative, but the identification of T is more involved. In general we expect that

[formula]

(where the proportionality sign means that the normalization of the operator must also be fixed). Note that T cannot mix with higher towers because that would spoil the short-distance behaviour. The identification of T is an open question, to which we return in the conclusions.

Sinh-Gordon model with Dirichlet boundary conditions

The sinh-Gordon theory in the bulk is defined by the Lagrangian

[formula]

It can be considered as the analytic continuation of the sine-Gordon model for imaginary coupling β = ib. The S-matrix of the model is

[formula]

In this case there is no self-fusion pole, and so bulk dynamical singularities are absent. The minimal bulk two-particle form factor belonging to this S-matrix is [\cite=FMS]

[formula]

satisfying

[formula]

and therefore f(θ)  ~  O(1) as θ  →    ∞  .

Sinh-Gordon theory can be restricted to the negative half-line, but integrability is only maintained by imposing either the Dirichlet

[formula]

or the two parameter family of perturbed Neumann

[formula]

boundary conditions [\cite=GZ]. The latter interpolates between the Neumann and the Dirichlet boundary conditions, since for M0 = 0 we recover the Neumann, while for M0  →    ∞   the Dirichlet boundary condition with ΦD0  =  Φ0. The reflection factor which depends on two continuous parameters can be written as [\cite=shGEF]

[formula]

and can be obtained as the analytic continuation of the first breather reflection factor in boundary sine-Gordon model which was calculated by Ghoshal in [\cite=ghoshal]. The relation of the bootstrap parameters E and F to the parameters of the Lagrangian is known both from a semiclassical calculation [\cite=shGEF] [\cite=corrigan] and also in an exact form in the perturbed boundary conformal field theory framework [\cite=sinG_uvir]. Imposing Dirichlet boundary condition instead of the general one corresponds to removing the F dependent factor from R(θ).

Recursion relations for the form factors with Dirichlet boundary conditions

Boundary form factors for sinh-Gordon theory with Dirichlet boundary condition have already been investigated to some extent in [\cite=bffprogram], and many solutions were constructed by Castro-Alvaredo [\cite=alvaredo] at the self-dual point B = 1. Here we aim to classify all the solutions for general coupling.

The 1PFF corresponding to Dirichlet boundary condition is [\cite=bffprogram]

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

The asymptotics of the 1PFF is [formula] as θ  →    ∞  . The one-particle coupling to the boundary is given by

[formula]

Writing the n-particle form factors in the general form

[formula]

and choosing the ratio of the Hn-s appropriately the recursion equations take the form:

[formula]

where Pn is given by eqns. ([\ref=eq:Pequ], [\ref=eq:ypmeq]) with [formula],

[formula]

and the bulk and boundary kinematical recursions again satisfy the appropriate generalization of the compatibility relation ([\ref=eq:PBrelation]). Note that for E = 0 the right-hand side of the boundary kinematical relation is zero:

[formula]

and so one could dispense with the boundary kinematical recursion choosing an Ansatz of the form

[formula]

as in [\cite=bffprogram]. In this paper, however, we choose to treat the two cases together.

Counting towers and the spectrum of local operators

The recursion relations ([\ref=eq:sinhgrecursions]) have the following degrees:

[formula]

and so simple towers are defined as

[formula]

while the naive scaling dimension of a simple tower corresponding to the polynomials [formula] is given by

[formula]

Due to the absence of bulk dynamical singularities, the generating kernel polynomial at level n is the product of the ones for the bulk and boundary kinematical recursions

[formula]

with degree

[formula]

and the naive scaling dimension of the simple tower starting from the polynomial [formula] is

[formula]

The generating function ([\ref=eq:towercharacter]) takes the form

[formula]

where [formula] is simply the number of all partitions of n.

On the other hand, the independent boundary operators for the Dirichlet boundary condition Φ(t,x = 0) = Φ0 are simply given by the differential monomials

[formula]

which have scaling weight [formula]. Therefore the number of operators with a given scaling weight [formula] is indeed equal to the number of integer partitions of n.

General boundary conditions

When both E and F are nonzero, the 1PFF reads

[formula]

with asymptotics rEF  ~  O(1) when θ  →    ∞  , and therefore the scaling dimension of a simple tower is

[formula]

and so each tower starting from an elementary kernel polynomial Kn' has naive scaling dimension x = 0. This results in infinitely many towers corresponding to any integer value of the naive scaling dimension!

This is in fact not so surprising if we consider the expected spectrum of scaling operators. These are of the form

[formula]

(the x-derivatives of the field can be expressed with exponential operators using the boundary condition). These can be thought to be organized into families of descendents of the exponential operators

[formula]

the descendent level given by [formula], so the number of descendents at some level n is the number of partitions of the integer n. However, the exponential operator has naive (classical) scaling dimension zero: its scaling weight is a fully quantum effect. Although at first it seems that there exists a continuum of such operators, recall that they can be expressed in terms of powers of the field:

[formula]

which shows that they depend only on countably many independent operators, the powers Φk (which are not scaling fields in themselves, their correlation function involves logarithms) so one expects only a countable infinity of form factor towers with naive scaling dimension 0, which is indeed what we found.

In this paper we cannot go further with the identification between the form factor towers and the local operators because some further tools are necessary in order to classify the towers of zero naive scaling dimension arising from the kernel solutions; see the conclusions in the next section for details. We only wish to note that our results in the free field limit are identical to those in [\cite=bffprogram], and that the whole situation above is very similar to the case of the bulk sinh-Gordon model [\cite=koubek_mussardo].

Conclusions and open problems

In this paper we performed the classification and counting of the solutions of the boundary form factor bootstrap based on their ultraviolet behaviour. We showed that in the boundary version of the scaling Lee-Yang model and in the boundary sinh-Gordon model the results are in perfect agreement with the expectations based on boundary conformal field theory in the first case and on the Lagrangian formulation in the second. This gives an additional and crucial piece of evidence for the consistency of the bootstrap axioms developed in [\cite=bffprogram].

Our discussion, however, has made several open problems manifest, that are worthwhile to be pursued in the future.

The issue of anomalous dimensions

The first is the question of anomalous dimensions. It was shown (using the example of the boundary operator φ and its descendents in the Lee-Yang case) that the naive dimension obtained from the asymptotic growth of the form factors of some tower is not necessarily identical to the exact ultraviolet weight of the corresponding operator. In fact the counting of towers depends very much on the additional assumption that anomalous contributions to the scaling dimensions do not mess up the spectrum, and so the space of simple towers with a given value of the naive scaling dimension x can be brought into correspondence with the space of local operators of a given value for the exact ultraviolet weight h.

This issue is also well-known in the bulk and there the computation the ultraviolet weight can be tackled by two different approaches. One of them uses the cumulant expansion of the logarithm of the two-point function [\cite=smirnovcumulant] (for a very nice discussion see also [\cite=babujiankarowski]). The spectral expansion ([\ref=eq:2pt]) can be written in the following form for the Euclidean two-point function

[formula]

where we used that the functions fn are symmetric and even in all the rapidity variables due to the symmetry properties of the form factors (note that in a unitary theory they are also positive semidefinite, but that is not necessary for the following argument). Supposing that the leading n = 0 term in the short-distance limit is a constant and normalizing it to 1 we can write a similar expansion for the logarithm of the correlation function

[formula]

where the hn are the cumulants of the functions fn defined recursively by

[formula]

Defining

[formula]

it is easy to see that the functions n depend only on the differences of the rapidities (for spinless operators in the bulk this is already true for fn and therefore also hn and in that case [formula]). Following the same argument as in the bulk case we arrive at the representation

[formula]

for the short-distance exponent defined in ([\ref=eq:shortdistance]).

The main problem with this approach is that the limit ([\ref=eq:hbarlimit]) exists only for boundary operators for which the naive scaling dimension is zero, and therefore it is of very limited use (in the bulk it obviously exists for any spinless operator, but a similar problem appears when trying to apply this approach to operators with non-vanishing Lorentz spin). An example to which the cumulant expansion ([\ref=eq:cumulantexpansion]) can be applied is given by the operator φ in the scaling Lee-Yang model with Φ boundary condition, but in that case we already have a much more detailed comparison with the conformal prediction directly via the two-point function, which was carried out in [\cite=bffprogram]. Therefore it is an interesting problem to develop some method to extract the ultraviolet dimension directly using only the spectral densities fn, generalizing the above argument.

The other approach in the bulk is to use a sum rule such as the so-called Δ-theorem developed in [\cite=delta-th]. Unfortunately, the arguments used in the bulk case are not directly applicable to boundary theories, because the boundary component of the energy-momentum tensor does not obey any conservation law in itself, but it remains to be seen whether there exists some other way of deriving a sum rule.

A further possibility along this line of thought would be to examine the operator product of T (the operator that corresponds to the conformal boundary Virasoro current off criticality) with the boundary operator O in question using the spectral representation for their two-point function, since it is known from boundary conformal field theory that they have an operator product expansion of the form

[formula]

but to perform this we would need to identify the form factors corresponding to T; the discussion below just highlights the difficulties related to operator identification.

Operator identification

It is also an open problem how to identify individual operators with their corresponding towers. In some cases this is straightforward, like for the operator with the lowest conformal weight (an excellent example is again the operator φ in the scaling Lee-Yang model with Φ boundary condition, or the boundary stress energy tensor T in the case of the [formula] boundary condition [\cite=bffprogram]). It is also rather easy to identify form factors of derivative operators since

[formula]

(once the form factors of O are known). For other operators, however, the identification is not at all straightforward. Take the example of the boundary stress energy tensor T for the Φ boundary condition in the scaling Lee-Yang model (subsection 3.2) where the new tower at x = 2, corresponding to the appearance of T, mixes non-trivially with other towers according to ([\ref=eq:Tmixing]). It is not easy to disentangle the mixing and so produce a direct identification. There are certainly some approaches to try which we leave to future investigations.

One possibility is to calculate the mutual two-point correlation functions of the towers T̃, φ, ∂φ, ∂2φ and compare it numerically to the conformal perturbation theory prediction for the operators T, φ, L- 1φ, L2- 1φ (in fact only the correlators involving T̃ are necessary). Using that, one can then fit the mixing (and normalization) coefficients numerically.

Another approach to operator identification in general is to use a boundary extension of the approach developed by Delfino and Niccoli for the bulk scaling Lee-Yang model in [\cite=descendents] who used the fact that part of the conformal descendents can be generated using derivation (L- 1) and the charges which remain conserved off-criticality. This is very efficient for low levels: it makes possible the precise identification of towers with the appropriate operators up to descendent level 7. It remains to be seen whether this method can be extended to the boundary case.

In general, however, it is also difficult to identify towers corresponding to the primary fields. As we have shown in subsection 4.3, this is a very complicated issue in the boundary sinh-Gordon model with general boundary conditions, where an infinity of x = 0 towers must be matched against the spectrum of exponential fields. In the bulk case form factors of primary fields satisfy a factorization property [\cite=Smirnov] [\cite=smirnovcumulant] [\cite=mussardo_simonetti], for which a general argument was given in [\cite=delta-th]. Factorization makes possible the identification of towers corresponding to primary fields, and can also be extended to descendents. It remains to be seen whether such clustering property can be extended to the boundary form factor bootstrap: at first sight, it seems more promising to take an approach which relates clustering to the operator product expansion as in the paper [\cite=balog_weisz] by Balog and Weisz instead of one appealing to conformal holomorphic factorization (as done by Cardy et al. in [\cite=delta-th]), which is broken by the presence of the boundary condition. In this regard it is also interesting to examine the relation between the bulk and boundary form factor bootstrap, to which we now turn.

Connection to the bulk form factor bootstrap

Isolating the leading asymptotic coefficient of the n-particle form factor FOn in the large rapidity limit

[formula]

it is obvious that [formula] is a function of rapidity differences only, and it is also easy to verify that it satisfies the bulk form factor axioms as a consequence of FOn satisfying the boundary form factor axioms. Therefore [formula] can identified with the n-particle form factor [formula] of some bulk operator [formula]. As an example, using the asymptotic behaviours of the 2PFF function f in ([\ref=eq:min2pffly]) and of the 1PFF function rΦ in ([\ref=eq:1pffphi]), the form factor tower Fφ ([\ref=eq:fitower]) in the Lee-Yang model with Φ boundary condition in this limit gives rise (up to normalization) to the bulk form factor tower of the trace of stress energy tensor Θ found by Zamolodchikov [\cite=Z1]. As an application of this correspondence it is easy to see that the bulk cumulant expansion for the anomalous dimension of Θ in [\cite=smirnovcumulant] is just twice the expression ([\ref=eq:cumulantexpansion]) evaluated for the boundary field φ. This is consistent with the fact that in the bulk ΔΘ =  - 2 / 5 while for the boundary case Δφ =  - 1 / 5.

This correspondence may be related in some way to the bulk-boundary operator product expansion in boundary conformal field theory [\cite=bulkboundaryope], and it is possible that (extending the example above) the exact scaling dimension of operators can be identified this way using known results for the bulk form factors. It could also explain why the detailed structure of the counting of form factor towers (kernels, naive scaling dimensions, character identities to use etc.) is so similar to the bulk case as it was treated in [\cite=koubek_mussardo] [\cite=koubek1] [\cite=koubek2].
