Milnor algebras could be isomorphic to modular algebras

Introduction

Let [formula] be a germ of an isolated hypersurface singularity defined by an analytic function f(x) = 0, [formula]. An important topological invariant of the germ is the Milnor number, which can be computed as the [formula]-dimension of the so-called Milnor algebra [formula], [\cite=1]. The Milnor algebra carries a canonical structure of a [formula]-algebra defined by the multiplication with f. A special version of the Mather-Yau theorem states that the R-class (right-equivalence class) of the function f(x) with isolated critical point is fully determined by the isomorphism class of Q(f) as [formula]-algebra [\cite=scherk].

By computational experiments, we have found another occurrence of the Milnor algebra - this time connected with the K-class (the contact equivalence class) of f(x), i.e. with the isomorphism-class of the germ X0. Our observation concerns unimodal functions that are not quasihomogeneous. Here we consider a miniversal deformation F:X  →  S of the singularity X0. It has a smooth base space of dimension τ, with τ being the Tjurina number, i.e. the [formula]-dimension of the Tjurina algebra T(f): = Q(f) / fQ(f). We consider the relative singular locus [formula] of X over S and its flatness stratum [formula], which depends only on X0, up to isomorphism. The flatness stratum is computable for sufficiently simple functions using a special algorithm [\cite=flatalg]. Surprisingly, the local ring of the flatness stratum of a unimodal singularity is isomorphic in all computed cases, either to the Milnor algebra of the defining function (in case [formula]), or to the Milnor algebra of a 'nearby' function with non-isolated critical point, otherwise.

The notion of a modular stratum was developed by Palamodov, [\cite=P1], in order to find a moduli space for singularities. It coincides with the flatness stratum [formula] [\cite=flat], which has been described for unimodal functions in [\cite=lum]. Only for some singularities from the T-series the modular stratum has expected dimension 1 with smooth curves and embedded fat points as primary components. The combinatorial pattern of its occurrence was found and the phenomenon of a splitting singular locus along a τ-constant stratum was discovered. Here we extend our observation that the modular stratum is the spectrum of the Milnor algebra of an associated non-isolated limiting singularity.

The modular stratum is a fat point of multiplicity μ isomorphic to [formula] in all other (computed) cases of T-series singularities. The same holds for all 14 exceptional and non-quasihomogeneous unimodal singularities. In the case of a quasihomogenous exceptional singularity, the modular stratum is a smooth germ, hence corresponding to a trivial Milnor algebra.

For completeness, we will first recall the basic results on modular strata and prove that they are algebraic. Second, we collect and complete results on the modular strata of unimodal functions, which are already found in [\cite=lum]. Subsequently, some of the non-trivial unexpected isomorphisms are presented. A further example of higher modality is discussed in section 4. Hypotheses towards a possible generalisation of these experimental results are formulated. Finally an algorithmic approach is outlined, how to perform a check of algebra isomorphy using a computer algebra system, knowing that there is no practical algorithm in general. All computations were executed in the computer algebra system Singular [\cite=9].

Characterisations of a modular germ

The definition of modularity was introduced by Palamodov, cf.  for instance [\cite=P1] and [\cite=P2], and was simultaneously discussed by Laudal for the case of formal power series under the name prorepresentable substratum'. This notion can be considered for any isolated singularity with respect to several deformation functors or to deformations of other objects, cf. [\cite=nato]. For simplicity we restrict ourselves to the case of a germ of an isolated complex hypersurface singularity [formula], or an isolated complete intersection singularity (ICIS).

A deformation of X0 is a flat morphism of germs ξ:X  →  S with its special fibre isomorphic to X0. It is called versal, if any other deformation of X0 can be induced via a morphism of the base spaces up to isomorphism. It is called miniversal, if the dimension of the base space is minimal. Miniversal deformations exist for isolated singularities and are unique up to a non-canonical isomorphism. In case of a hypersurface, a miniversal deformation has a smooth base space, i.e. the deformations are unobstructed. It can be represented as an embedded deformation [formula], [formula], X = F- 1(0), [formula], where [formula] induces a [formula]-basis of the Tjurina algebra T(f).

Obviously, a miniversal deformation has not the properties of a moduli space, because there are always isomorphic fibres or even locally trivial subfamilies. Hence, the inducing morphism of another deformation is not unique. One can, however, look for subfamilies of a miniversal deformation having this universal property.

Let ξ:X  →  S be a miniversal deformation of a complex germ X0. A subgerm M  ⊆  S of the base space germ is called modular if the following universal property holds: If φ:T  →  M and ψ:T  →  S are morphisms such that the induced deformations φ*(ξ|M) and ψ*(ξ) over T are isomorphic, then φ  =  ψ.

The union of two modular subgerms inside a miniversal family is again modular. Hence, a unique maximal modular subgerm exists. It is called modular stratum of the singularity. Note that any two modular strata of a singularity are isomorphic by definition.

If X0 is an ICIS with a good [formula]-action, i.e. defined by quasihomogeneous polynomials, then its modular stratum coincides with the reduced τ-constant stratum and is smooth, cf. [\cite=alex].

Palamodov's definition of modularity is difficult to handle. It made it challenging to find non-trivial explicit examples. Even the knowledge of the basic characterisations of modularity in terms of cotangent cohomology, which were already discussed by Palamodov and Laudal, did not lead to more examples, cf. [\cite=P1].

Given a miniversal deformation ξ:X  →  S of an isolated singularity X0, the following conditions are equivalent for a subgerm of the base space M  ⊆  S:

M is modular.

M is infinitesimally modular, i.e. injectivity of the relative Kodaira-Spencer map T0(S,OM)   →   T1(X / S,OS)|M holds.

M has the lifting property of vector fields of the special fibre: T0(X / S,OS)|M →   [formula] is surjective.

Note that T0 corresponds to the module of associated vector fields, while T1 describes all infinitesimal deformations. It is represented in the hypersurface case by the (relative) Tjurina algebra [formula].

All geometric objects belong to the category of analytic germs. But an isolated singularity is algebraic, i.e. its defining equations can be chosen as polynomials. Ad hoc it is not clear whether the modular stratum is algebraic, too, and to our knowledge it has not been demonstrated. Here, we add a proof in case of ICIS for completeness.

Let X0 be a germ of an isolated complete intersection singularity. Then its modular stratum [formula] is an algebraic subgerm.

The proof uses the characterisation of modularity as flatness stratum of the Tjurina-module. A more general result holds under weaker assumptions than ICIS, too, cf. [\cite=flat].

Let [formula] be an isolated complete intersection singularity defined by p equations [formula] with miniversal deformation ξ:X  →  S. Then the modular space coincides with the flatness stratum of the relative Tjurina module T1(X / S) = OpX / (∂F / ∂x)OpX as OS-module, F being the equations of the deformation.

We may choose the defining equations [formula] of the germ X0 as polynomials by finite determination of isolated singularities. The affine variety defined by these polynomials [formula] has in general other singularities than the zero point. But, we can choose an embedding such that [formula] is concentrated at zero. This holds iff global and local Tjurina number are equal

[formula]

Consider the [formula]-module [formula]. The module B is finite as [formula]-module. Its flatness stratum over S at zero [formula], [formula], is well defined by the fitting ideal of B as [formula]-module. The [formula]-module T1(X / S,OS) is finite as [formula]-module. Consider the modules B0: = B / sB and T1(X0) = T1(X / S,OS)|s = 0, then the localisation at x = 0 of B0 and T1(X0) have identical module-structures which are both already given as [formula]-modules: B0 (x) = T1(X0), hence the germ at zero [formula] coincides with the flattening stratum of T1(X / S,OS).

We add some remarks concerning the flatness criterion:

The support of T1(X / S,OS) is exactly the relative singular locus of the mapping germ [formula] over S. In case of a hypersurface, i.e. p = 1, T1(X / S,OS) coincides with the OS-algebra of the relative singular locus, that is the relative Tjurina-algebra [formula].

The support of the flatness-stratum [formula] is the locus where the finitely generated OS-module T1(X / S,OS) has constant rank τ. The fact that Mred is the τ-constant stratum was already explained by Palamodov, cf. [\cite=P1]. Besides the case of a quasihomogeneous singularity, see example [\ref=ex1], a non-reduced structure of M is expected generally.

It follows from a non-trivial result, cf. [\cite=le], that the finite map [formula] is unramified over the μ-constant stratum. But the analogous statement for the τ-constant stratum does not hold, see below. This phenomenon we have called splitting singular locus over the τ-constant stratum.

Computing the modular germs of unimodal singularities

Applying the algorithm for computing the flatness stratum, cf. [\cite=flatalg], we can compute the modular stratum of not too complicated singularities. More precisely, the output of the algorithm is the k-jet of the germ of the flatness stratum for some positive integer k. If the modular stratum is a fat point we are done with some big number k. We can not prove or even expect to end up with an algebraic representation generally. But, it does occur, as in all presented examples below.

The classification of singularities starts with the simple singularities, the ADE-singularities. These are all quasihomogeneous, their modular strata are all trivial, i.e. simple points. Following the classification of functions by Arnol'd [\cite=agv] the next more complicated singularities are the unimodal ones. They are characterised by the fact, that in a neighbourhood of the function only R-orbit families occur which depend on at most one parameter.

Recall the classification of unimodal functions: We have the T-series singularities and 14 so called exceptional unimodal singularities. We may restrict their representation to three variables up to stable equivalence. Any type is representing a one-parameter μ-constant family of R-equivalence classes. The exceptional ones, cf. appendix [\ref=sec:appendix-table], are all semi-quasihomogeneous of a special type: The μ-constant family can be written as

[formula]

where f0 is quasihomogeneous and [formula] is the Hesse form of f0. Such a family splits into exactly two K-classes, one quasihomogeneous (λ = 0) with trivial modular stratum and one semi-quasihomogeneous ([formula], we call it of Hesse-type). Here τ(f1) = μ(f1) - 1 holds, the modular strata are fat points of multiplicity μ, cf. [\cite=lum].

The singularities of the T-series are defined by the equations

[formula]

In exactly three cases we have [formula]. These singularities are quasihomogeneous. They are called the parabolic singularities P8, X9 and J10 in Arnold's notation or elliptic hypersurface singularities Ẽ6, Ẽ7 and Ẽ8, in Saito's paper [\cite=sa]:

Ẽ6 = P8  =  T3,3,3: x3 + y3 + z3  +  λxyz,  λ3  ≠   - 33,  τ  =  μ = 8;

[formula];

[formula].

It is well known that their K-classes (here equal to the R-classes) are not determined by λ. The K-equivalence induces a discrete equivalence relation on the λ-line with the indicated gaps. Its quotient is an affine line parametrised by the classical j-invariant of elliptic curves. Precise formulæ  for j can be found in Saito's paper. Their modular strata are germs of a line.

All other T-series singularities are called hyperbolic. Their K-class is independent of λ, [formula], the Newton boundary has three maximal faces and the singularity is neither quasihomogeneous nor semi-quasihomogeneous. We have τ(Tp,q,r) = μ(Tp,q,r) - 1 = p + q + r - 2. The modular strata of the hyperbolic singularities are more complicated. Some of them are 1-dimensional, others are just fat points. First computations are discussed in [\cite=lum].

Obviously, a hyperbolic singularity of type Tp,q,r is adjacent to another T-series singularity, iff all three parameters (p,q,r) are greater or equal to the parameters of the second. Hence, any hyperbolic singularity is adjacent to at least one parabolic singularity. Inspecting the list we find exactly six types of hyperbolic singularities which have the same Tjurina number as an adjacent parabolic singularity. They are candidates for modular strata of dimension 1, because in their miniversal deformation the associated parabolic singularity occurs as one dimensional τ-constant family including the special fibre. Indeed, these six singularities are leading members of six sub-series of the hyperbolic singularities, which have a one-dimensional modular strata, cf. [\cite=lum]. These exceptional sub-series are characterised by the fact, that two of the three indices coincide with that of a parabolic one.

Any singularity of one of the following six exceptional sub-series contains a splitting line in their modular stratum:

[formula]

[formula]

The families over the τ-constant lines with index k are given by

[formula]

The fibre singularities over [formula] consist of one singularity of the associated parabolic type and of one singularity of type Ak - l - 1 outside the zero section, if k > l - 1. These lines, called splitting lines, are components of the modular stratum, which mostly contains another embedded component (fat point) at zero. Exactly three of the singularities of the sub-series have two line components and two of them have three line components, cf. [\cite=lum]. We call these five types the symmetric exceptions, because they come from an additional symmetry in the equation or from a crossover of two exceptional sub-series. All other computed examples of modular strata of T-series singularities, not belonging to the above six exceptional sub-series, are fat points.

ft: = x4 + y3 + z3 + xyz + tx3 is a τ-constant deformation of T4,3,3 with generic fibre type P8. The modular deformation ft fits into the λ-line of P8(λ) at infinity: [formula] for [formula], i.e. we get a threefold covering of the t-line, [formula], by the λ-line, [formula]. We may think of a compactification of the modular λ-line of P8 at infinity with a point corresponding to the T4,3,3-singularity. The same holds for T4,4,3 and T5,4,2 with respect to X9. This causes two different compactifications of the same modular family over the punctured disc X9(1 / λ), λ > N, at the special point zero to a modular family over the disc.

New explicit results on unimodal modular strata

A careful inspection of our computations leads us to generic formulæ  for the equations of the modular strata of the T-series singularities in terms of the index-parameters (p,q,r). We confirm these equations by checking all modular strata up to τ < 50, giving a strong indication of their correctness. Moreover, it gives an explanation for the occurrence of line components in the modular strata of exceptional sub-series singularities. In addition we obtain the isomorphy of the modular algebra of a T-series singularity, not belonging to one of the six sub-series, to its Milnor algebra, the isomorphy of the modular algebra of sub-series singularities to the Milnor algebra of certain non-isolated functions, and the isomorphy of all modular strata from the same sub-series up to the five symmetric exceptions.

Let X0 be the hyperbolic singularity defined by f = xp + yq + zr + xyz. Then

[formula]

defines a miniversal deformation X  →  S of X0, with [formula].

We consider the following the ideal I(p,q,r)  ⊂  OS:

[formula]

where

[formula]

with coefficients

[formula]

[formula]

The coefficient cp is zero iff [formula] for some 1  ≤  k  ≤  p, and similarly for dq and er. So one of them vanishes exactly if Tp,q,r belongs to one of the six exceptional sub-series. More than one of the coefficients is zero exactly for the five symmetric exceptions, see proposition [\ref=symexc]. Hence, the number of vanishing coefficients corresponds to the number of line components.

We have checked by computer.

The ideal I(p,q,r) from example [\ref=exmp:tseries] defines the modular stratum of the singularity T = Tp,q,r, if τ(T)  ≤  50.

A linear diagonal transformation

[formula]

induces isomorphy of the algebra defined by I(p,q,r) and the Milnor algebra of Tp,q,r in the case that none of the coefficients cp, dq and er vanishes.

If Tp,q,r does not belong to one of the six exceptional sub-series, then

[formula]

In particular, for those singularities with τ < 50 the Milnor algebra is isomorphic to the modular algebra of the singularity.

We associate to an exceptional sub-series (Tk,q,r)k the limit singularity T∞  ,q,r defined by the equation yq + zr + xyz, which is non-isolated and belongs to the closure of the K-orbit of any member of the sub-series.

If [formula] belongs to one of the six exceptional sub-series, then

[formula]

apart from the five symmetric exceptions. In particular, for those singularities [formula] with τ < 50 the Milnor algebra Q(T∞  ,q,r) is isomorphic to the modular algebra of the singularity.

Again, the isomorphy to the Milnor algebra is obtained by multiplying t1,u1,v1 with some constants. It remains to check the five symmetric exceptions.

The local algebra of a modular stratum is isomorphic to the Milnor algebra of a non-isolated singularity for the five symmetric exceptions of T-series singularities:

[formula]

This follows from the equations in example [\ref=exmp:tseries] and proposition [\ref=sec:prop-t-series-formulae].

Next we investigate the modular strata of all 14 exceptional semi-quasihomogeneous singularities and obtain a similar result.

All 14 exceptional semi-quasihomogeneous unimodal singularities fulfil: The local ring of their modular stratum is isomorphic to their Milnor algebra.

We list our results in a table at the end of the article. The isomorphisms are rather complicated. They are computed with the algorithm presented in appendix [\ref=sec:algorithm]. We omit the formulæ, but discuss only one case in detail.

We consider f  =  x4 + y5 + x2y3 and choose [formula] as representatives of a [formula]-basis of the Tjurina algebra T(f). Now, [formula] defines a miniversal deformation X  →  S of X0.

The ideal IM  ⊂  OS of the maximal modular subgerm M  ⊂  S, computed with Singular is given by the following completely interreduced generators:

[formula]

[formula]

OM is a zero-dimensional local algebra of embedding dimension 2. A minimal embedding is defined by the two polynomials printed in bold. The mapping

[formula]

defines an isomorphism between this local algebra and the Milnor algebra of f.

We give the isomorphism for Z11 and S11:

See appendix [\ref=sec:algorithm] for an algorithm that calculates these isomorphormism.

In the table in appendix [\ref=sec:appendix-table] we list the relevant equations of the modular strata of all 14 unimodal exceptional singularities. The last monomial of the normal form induces in Q(f) the Hesse form of the quasihomogeneous leading form f0. The representatives of a [formula]-basis of T(f) [formula] are given in the second column, which are used to fix a miniversal deformation [formula]. The equations in column three describe the modular stratum in the base of this deformation. Note, that we omit equations of the form si  +  O(s2), because we may eliminate the variables occurring linearly in these equations. A minimal embedding with the remaining variables is given by the listed equations in the last column. In the miniversal deformation these remaining variables si correspond to the monomials printed in bold.

Further examples and questions

We have calculated modular strata for singularities of higher modality, too. The results raise hope that our observation generalises. We give one example of a bimodal singularity.

We consider the hypersurface singularity given by the semi-quasihomogeneous singularity of Hesse type f = x10 + y3 + x4y2. A miniversal deformation is defined by

[formula]

The maximal modular subgerm M in the base this deformation is defined by an ideal generated by

[formula]

The local ring OM  =  O17 / JM is again isomorphic to Q(f) via

[formula]

with coefficients

[formula]

In all the examples we have considered a function f defining an isolated hypersurface singularity X0, and related its modular stratum to the Milnor algebra of f. If we take another K-equivalent function f', the isomorphism-class of the modular stratum does not change by definition. While μ(f) is an invariant of K-class, this is in general not true for the isomorphism-class of the Milnor algebra, cf. [\cite=by].

Nevertheless, we have the following proposition for singularities with τ  =  μ - 1.

Let be f an analytic function with isolated critical point with τ(f) = μ(f) - 1, then its Milnor algebra is K-invariant.

This is a direct implication of the following two lemmas.

[\cite=by] If [formula] then [formula]-class and the K-class of f coincide.

Let [formula] be a function with isolated singularity and [formula] a vector field with δ(f)∈(f) then [formula].

This statement is only a slight generalisation of [\cite=saqh] and we can use the same proof found there with gf = δ(f) instead of f.

Look at the exact sequence

[formula]

Then [formula] has [formula]-dimension μ - 1 and thus equals the maximal ideal [formula]. That means [formula]. Because of lemma [\ref=lemma:saito], even [formula] holds. By lemma [\ref=lemma:bensonyau] we know that the K-class of f equals its [formula]-class, but Q(f) is [formula]-invariant.

Due to this result we can speak of the Milnor algebra of a hypersurface singularity in the case τ  =  μ - 1. Hence, we can state the following conjecture, motivated by our examples.

We found the modular strata to be of Milnor type in all computed examples. So one could ask more generally: For which singularities is the modular stratum of Milnor type?

Up to now we were not able to proof the hypothesis. There are some indications that it is strongly connected with the restriction μ  -  τ = 1.

Modular strata of exceptional unimodal singularities

Finding isomorphisms between Artinian local rings

We have to look for isomorphisms between local rings of modular strata and algebras of Milnor type in order to test the hypothesis for the above examples. Using computer algebra and a direct approach we check, whether two Artinian local algebras [formula] and [formula] are isomorphic. A slightly generalised problem is considered. Let A be arbitrary and B Artinian. We will check if there is a surjective homomorphism A  →  B. After eliminating variables we may assume that [formula].

Choose representatives of a [formula]-basis of B [formula] and make an ansatz as follows:

[formula]

Our aim is to decide for which choice of [formula] φ defines a surjection such that φ(IA)  ⊂  IB. Put [formula] and

[formula]

Fix generators [formula] of IA and a local term ordering >   on [formula] and compute the reduced normal forms [formula] of ai with respect to a standard basis GB of [formula]. Consider the ideal J  ⊂  R, generated by the coefficients of the ãi. Any [formula] defines an evaluation homomorphism

[formula]

With the notation of above: [formula] defines surjection [formula] with φ(IA)  ⊂  IB if and only if [formula].

Obviously [formula] defines indeed a surjection [formula] iff not all n-minors of [formula] vanish. The key observation is: ep(ãi) is a reduced normal form for ep(ai) with respect to GB. Hence, all coefficients of ãi have to be mapped to zero by ep in order to have [formula]. Thus, all coefficients must belong to [formula].

For Artinian algebras A and B we first check that their [formula]-dimensions coincide. If the algorithm leads to a homomorphism φ:A  →  B, this will be a surjective homomorphism of vector spaces of same dimension. Thus, φ is injective, too. If the algorithm does not succeed in finding a surjective homomorphism, then A and B can not be isomorphic.
