Supersymmetric Black Holes

Our setup for constructing supersymmetric black hole solutions is N = 2 supergravity couled to n vector multiplets. This arises as the effective field theory of heterotic string compactifications on K3  ×  T2 and of type-II string theory on Calabi-Yau threefolds. The field equations are invariant under [formula] rotations, which generalize the electric-magnetic duality rotations of Einstein-Maxwell theory. As a consequence, all vector multiplet couplings are encoded in a single holomorphic function called the prepotential F. This function must be homogenous of degree 2 in its variables YI, which provide homogenous coordinates on the scalar manifold MVM. The Kähler potential for the metric on MVM can be expressed in terms of the holomorphic prepotential. The resulting geometry is known as special (Kähler) geometry [\cite=deWit:1984pk] [\cite=deWit:1984px]. It is possible to include a certain class of higher derivative terms involving the square of the Riemann tensor and arbitrary powers of gauge field strengths, by giving the prepotential an explicit dependence on the so-called Weyl multiplet. Associated to these terms is an infinite series of field-dependent couplings. In type-II compactifications these couplings can be computed in terms of the free energy of topologically twisted string theory [\cite=Bershadsky:1993cx] [\cite=Antoniadis:1993ze].

As long as we neglect the higher derivative terms, we are dealing with a generalized Einstein-Maxwell theory with several abelian gauge fields and field-dependent couplings, plus a scalar sigma-model. The supersymmetric black hole solutions of such a theory are natural generalizations of the extremal Reissner-Nordström black hole. Besides that the black hole now carries several electric and magnetic charges, the new feature is that we have scalar fields which vary non-trivially as a function of the radial variable. At infinity, the solutions are asymptotically flat and the scalars can take arbitrary values in MVM. The behaviour at the horizon is radically different: the scalars cannot take arbitrary values but must take fixed point values which are determined by the electric and magnetic charges of the black hole. This is the so-called black hole attractor mechanism [\cite=Ferrara:1995ih], which generalizes to the case where higher derivative terms are included [\cite=LopesCardoso:1998wt] [\cite=LopesCardoso:2000qm]. Since both metric and gauge fields are determined by the scalar fields through supersymmetry, it follows that the area of the event horizon is a function of the electric and magnetic charges, and does not depend on the values of the scalar fields at infinity. Once higher curvature terms are included in the action, the black hole entropy is no longer given by one quarter of the area of the event horizon but is given by the surface charge of the Killing vector field which becomes null on the horizon [\cite=Wald:1993nt]. When evaluating the surface charge for supersymmetric black holes in N = 2 supergravity, one sees that the entropy is given by the sum of two symplectic functions of the charges [\cite=LopesCardoso:1998wt]. While the first term is the area of the horizon divided by 4, the second term depends only on the couplings of the higher derivative terms. Therefore the black hole entropy is modified in two ways: first through the modification of the area itself, second by the deviation from the area law. The microscopic state degeneracy[\cite=Maldacena:1997de] [\cite=Vafa:1997gr] agrees with black hole entropy if and only if both corrections are taken into account [\cite=LopesCardoso:1998wt].

Black Hole Partition Functions

If one performs a partial Legendre transformation of the black hole entropy, which replaces the electric charges by the associated electrostatic potentials, one obtains the imaginary part of the 'generalized prepotential' [\cite=Ooguri:2004zv]. This is a power series in the Weyl multiplet which has as its coefficients the prepotential (determining the two-derivative couplings) and the coupling functions of the higher derivative terms. By the relation between couplings in the effective action and the topological string, this function is proportional to the real part of the (holomorphic) free energy of the topologically twisted type-II string. This suggests to interprete the imaginary part of the generalized prepotential as the free energy of the black hole, and one obtains the 'OSV-relation' [\cite=Ooguri:2004zv] ZBH  =  |Ztop|2, which relates the black hole partition function (exponential of the free energy) to the partition function of the topological string. However, many details of this proposal need to be made more precise. One is whether the relation is meant to be an exact statement (strong version) or as an asymptotic statement in the limit of large charges, which corresponds to the semi-classical limit (weak version). Before reviewing the evidence supporting the weak version, we need to address another point. By definition, the black hole free energy is a function of the magnetic charges and of the electrostatic potential. Thermodynamically this corresponds to a mixed ensemble, where the magnetic charges have been fixed, while electric charges fluctuate and the corresponding chemical potentials are fixed [\cite=Ooguri:2004zv]. This implies that a fundamental property, namely covariance with respect to symplectic transformations is not manifest. As a consequence, it is not clear whether the proposal is compatible with string dualities. In fact, discrepancies between the actual microscopic state degeneracy and the state degeneracy predicted by the OSV conjecture show that the OSV-relation must be modified[\cite=Shih:2005he] [\cite=LopesCardoso:2006bg]. A natural way of deriving the modification is based on the observation that the full Legendre transformation of the black hole entropy, where both electric and magnetic charges are replaced by the corresponding potentials has a natural meaning: the resulting function is a Hesse potential for the metric on the scalar manifold [\cite=LopesCardoso:2006bg]. Moreover, the relations between entropy, free energy (mixed ensemble), Hesse potential and attractor equations can be formulated in terms of a variational principle [\cite=Behrndt:1996jn] [\cite=LopesCardoso:2006bg]. This suggests to interprete the Hesse potential as the free energy of the black hole, but now with respect to a canonical instead of a mixed ensemble. One can show that this proposal leads to a specific correction factor in the OSV-relation. Explicit tests can be performed in compactifications with N = 4 supersymmetry, which can be treated within the N = 2 formalism explained in this article [\cite=LopesCardoso:1999ur]. Subleading corrections to the state degeneracy have been computed [\cite=Dijkgraaf:1996it] [\cite=LopesCardoso:2004xf] [\cite=Jatkar:2005bh] and the result agrees with the canonical black hole partition function proposed in [\cite=LopesCardoso:2006bg] in the semi-classical limit. The agreement is impressive as it involves an infinite series of non-perturbative corrections to the effective action. The precise relation between the canonical black hole partition function and the topological string remains to be clarified.
