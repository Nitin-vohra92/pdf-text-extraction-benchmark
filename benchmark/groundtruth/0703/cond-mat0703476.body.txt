Topological Vortex Lines in Two-Gap Superconductor

introduction

Superconductors allow for a rich variety of topological defects and phase transitions [\cite=T1]. The best known topological object is the Abrikosov vortex in one-gap superconductors. But the advent of two-gap superconductors has opened a new possibility for us to have far more interesting topological properties [\cite=zhang1]. The equivalence between the Ginzburg-Landau-Gross-Pitaevskii (GLGP) functional and the nonlinear O(3) σ model makes knotted solitons exist in the two-gap system [\cite=Babaev]; Monopoles different from those in one-gap superconductors have been also discussed in Ref. [\cite=jiang]. Here we shall particularly interest in the topological vortex lines in two-gap superconductor. The purpose of the paper is twofold. First we find out the condition, under which the vortices can carry an arbitrary fraction of magnetic flux quantum. The second purpose is to research the knotted configurations in the two-gap superconductor.

The intriguing possibilities of topological defects carrying a fraction of flux quantum have long attracted interest, and several nontrivial realizations were identified [\cite=T1]. Simultaneously, it is well known that knots as string structure of finite energy appear in a variety of physical scenarios, including the structure of elementary particles [\cite=liu1] [\cite=liu2], the early cosmology [\cite=liu3] [\cite=liu5], Bose-Einstein condensation [\cite=liu6]. In geometry, a knot is an embedding map γ:S1  →  R3. Two or more knots together are called a link, i.e., a family knots, which posses many important topological numbers, including self-linking number and Gauss linking number [\cite=liu9]. Here we research the vortex lines and the knotted vortex lines in two-gap superconductor from the point of view of topology and reveal the inner relationship between the Chern-Simon action and the topological characteristic numbers of the knot family.

Fractional magnetic flux

Two-gap superconductor can be described by a two-flavor (denoted by α = 1,2) GLGP functional, whose free energy density is given by

[formula]

where [formula]. The two condensates are characterized by the different effective masses mα, the different coherence lengths [formula] and the different concentrations Nα     =     〈|Ψα|2〉    =    bα / cα. Then it is known that the contribution of the condensate Ψ1 is [formula] and the condensate Ψ2 contributes [formula] to the two-gap system. What is the importance in the present GLGP model is that the two charged fields are not independent but nontrivial coupled through the electromagnetic field. This kind of nontrivial coupling indicates that in this system there should be a nontrivial, hidden topology. In order to find out the topological structure and to investigate it conveniently, we introduce the decomposition of U(1) gauge potential theory and the φ-mapping method [\cite=phi1] [\cite=phi2]. In the theory of two-gap superconductor, the condensate wave function Ψα are the order parameter of the charged continuum, which are sections of the complex line bundle: Ψα(x) = φ1α + iφ2α. The U(1) covariant derivative DμΨα are introduced to describe the interaction between Ψα and the electromagnetic field: DμΨα(x) = ∂μΨα - igAμΨα, where μ  =  0,1,2,3 denote the four-dimensional space-time, g = 2e  /  c, and Aμ is the U(1) gauge potential. Then the U(1) gauge field tensor is given by: Fμν  =  ∂μAν  -  ∂νAμ. Defining two-dimensional unit vectors in terms of φaα by: [formula] one can prove [\cite=liu13] that Aμ can be decomposed in terms of maα,

[formula]

where θ is a phase factor. Since ∂μθ does not contribute to the gauge field tensor Fμν, we obtain the two kinds of decomposition expression:

[formula]

As follows, we can see that the two-gap superconductor acquires properties which are qualitatively very different from those of a one-gap superconductor. Introducing a two-dimensional topological tensor current Kμνα = (1  /  4π)εμνλρεab∂λmaα∂ρmbα, using [formula] and considering the Green's function relation in φ space: [formula] (∂a  =  ∂  /  ∂φaα), one can prove that [\cite=phi1]: [formula]. Denoting the spacial components of Kμνα by Kiα = Ki0α, we have

[formula]

in which Di(φα / x) = Di0(φα / x) is the Jacobian vector. The expression of Eq. ([\ref=current]) provides an important conclusion: Kiα = 0, if and only if [formula]; [formula], if and only if [formula]. So it is necessary to study the zero points of [formula] to determine the nonzero solutions of Kiα. The implicit function theory [\cite=implicit] shows that under the regular condition Di(φα / x)  ≠  0, the general solutions of

[formula]

can be expressed as [formula], which represent the world surfaces of N moving isolated singular strings Lk with string parameter [formula]. This indicates that there are vortex lines located at the zero points of the [formula] field.

We investigate the magnetic flux carried by the vortices: [formula]. It is due to the different contributions of the two gaps that the magnetic flux can be expressed as: [formula]. Using the Stokes' theorem and the φ-mapping method, we get [formula] in which [formula] stands for the standard flux quantum in two-gap superconductor. In δ-function theory [\cite=delta], we can obtain a decomposition expression on the 2-dimensional surface Σ: [formula], where [formula] are the crossing points of vortices and the surface Σ, and the positive integer βl is the Hopf index of the φ-mapping, which means that when [formula] covers the neighborhood of the point [formula] once, the vector field [formula] covers the corresponding region in φ space βl times. Then the magnetic flux in two-gap system can be reexpressed as

[formula]

in which [formula] is the Brower degree of the φ-mapping. When β1l  =  β2l and η1l =  - η2l, it is easy to see that Φ = (κ1  -  κ2)W1Φ0, where [formula] is the winding number of the [formula] around [formula]. Since there exists the relation κ1  -  κ2  =   cos  [\cite=Babaev], one can arrive at the result that in the case of W1 =  - W2, the vortices in two-gap superconductor can carry an arbitrary fraction of magnetic flux quantum; When β1l  =  β2l and η1l  =  η2l, one can get [formula]. Thus in this case the vortices can carry only an integer number of magnetic flux quanta; When β1l  ≠  β2l, we obtain the general form of the magnetic flux in two-gap superconductor: Φ  =  κ1W1  +  κ2W2.

The knotted vortex lines

We will discuss the knotted vortex lines in the two-gap system. In δ-function theory [\cite=delta], one can prove that in three-dimensional space

[formula]

where [formula], and Σk is the kth planar element transverse to Lk with local coordinates (u1,u2). The positive integer βk is the Hopf index of the φ-mapping. Meanwhile taking notice of the definition of Jacobian, the direction vector of Lk is given by

[formula]

Then from Eqs. ([\ref=delta]) and ([\ref=volicity]), we obtain the inner structure of Kiα

[formula]

where Wαk  =  βαkηαk is the winding number of the field [formula] around Lk, with ηαk  =  D(φα / u) =   ±  1 being the Brouwer degree of φ-mapping. We can see that vortex lines exist at the zeros of the two order parameter field Ψ1 and Ψ2, respectively. To explore the topological property of the knotted vortices, introduce the Chern-Simon action, which is defined by [\cite=chern] [\cite=chern1]

[formula]

where i;j;k denote the three-dimensional space. It can be seen that considering Eq. ([\ref=tensor1]) and substituting Eq. ([\ref=K]) into Eq. ([\ref=chern]), one can obtain [formula]. Since Ai satisfies the U(1) gauge transformation: Ai' = Ai  +  ∂iφ, where φ∈I  R is a phase factor denoting the U(1) transformation, when these vortex lines are N closed curves, i.e., a family of N knots γk [formula], the terms ∂iφ contributes nothing to the integral

[formula]

Then the expression ([\ref=chern1]) is invariant under the gauge transformation. Meanwhile we know that S independent of the metric. Therefore one can conclude that S are topological invariant for the knotted vortex lines in two-gap superconductors.

In the following, we investigate the relations between the Chern-Simon action S and the topological numbers of a knot family. Let [formula] and [formula] be two points respectively on the knots γk and γl. Noticing the symmetry between the two points, Eq. ([\ref=chern1]) should be reexpressed as

[formula]

Considering that γk and γl can be the same one knot or two different knots, we should write Eq. ([\ref=chern2]) in two parts (k = l and k  ≠  l ); furthermore the k = l part includes both the [formula] and the [formula] cases. To explore the relation between S and the topological numbers of a family knot, we should first express Ai in terms of the vector field which carries the geometric information of the knot family. Define the Gauss mapping [formula] [formula], where [formula] is a three-dimensional unit vector, i.e., a section of sphere bundle S2. Let [formula] be a two-dimensional unit vector on the sphere S2 and satisfy: [formula]. Then, using the decomposition of U(1) gauge potential theory, one can obtain the inner structure of Ai in terms of [formula] as Ai  =  εabea∂ieb  (a,b = 1,2). Then the Chern-Simon action Eq. ([\ref=chern2]) is expressed as

[formula]

When γk and γl are the same one knot but [formula] and [formula] are different points, we get

[formula]

where [formula] is the pull-back of S2 surface element. The expression ([\ref=W]) is just related to the writhing number Wr(γk) of γk [\cite=White]: [formula]. Furthermore when k = l and [formula], Eq. ([\ref=chern2]) should be written as

[formula]

Let [formula] be the unit tangent vector of knot γk at [formula] ([formula] when [formula]), and [formula] is defined as ea  =  εabVb [formula]. One can prove that [formula], where Tw(γk) is the twisting number of γk. From the Calugareanu formula [\cite=White]: SL(γk) = Wr(γk) + Tw(γk), (where SL(γk) is the self-linking number of γk), we can see that Eqs. ([\ref=W]) and ([\ref=T]) just compose the self-linking numbers of the N knots. Let us discuss the third case: γl and γk are the different knots. It is easy to obtain

[formula]

Comparing the expression Eq. ([\ref=L]) with the definition of the Gauss linking number: [formula], we know that in this case the action S is related to the Gauss linking number Lk(γk,γl) between γk and γl  (k  ≠  l). Therefore, we arrive at the important result

[formula]

This precise expression just reveals the relationship between the Chern-Simon quantum number S and the linking numbers of the knots family. Since the self-linking and Gauss linking are both the intrinsic characteristic numbers of knotlike configurations in geometry, expression Eq. ([\ref=Chern3]) directly relates S to the topology of the knots family itself, and therefore S can be regarded as an important invariant required to describe the topology of knotted vortex lines in two-gap superconductor. This is just the significance of the introduction and research of topological invariant S

conclusion

In summary, we investigate the topological vortex lines and the knotted vortex lines in the two-gap superconductor. It is due to the different contribution of the two gaps that the vortex lines can carry an arbitrary fraction of magnetic flux. Furthermore, we find out that the Chern-Simon action is a topological invariant for the knot family and reveal that it is just the total sum of all the self-linking numbers and all the linking numbers of the knot family in two-gap superconductor.
