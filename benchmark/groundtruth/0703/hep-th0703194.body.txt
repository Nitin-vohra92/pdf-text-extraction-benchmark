Effective Fractional Hall Effect with Pseudo-Photons

Introduction and Conclusion

The integer Hall effect was first analysed experimentally by Klitzing, Dorda and Pepper [\cite=IHE_exp] in 1980 and explained theoretically by Laughlin [\cite=Laughlin_1]. The fractional hall effect was unexpected detected in 1982 by Tsui, Stormer and Gossard [\cite=FQHE_exp], who measured a hall conductivity of [formula] corresponding to a fractional Landau filling level of [formula]. The Laughlin wave function for the fractional Hall effect [\cite=Laughlin_2] was at that time derived phenomenologically and although not completely theoretically understood is the best account for this effect. It renders fractional filling levels [formula] for states corresponding to quasi-particles and quasi-holes of fractional electrical charge.

Laughlin's quasi-particles and quasi-holes are interpreted as composite fermions constituted by one electron with magnetic flux tubes attached known as anyons. These particles obey fractional statistics [\cite=frac] have a fractional spin-statistics relation which explain the fractional filling fraction. By moving an anyon adiabatically around a close loop we obtain both an Aharanov-Bohm contribution [\cite=AB] and a Berry phase contribution [\cite=Berry] (see [\cite=frac] for further details). After these developments the same results have been obtained using an effective Landau-Ginzburg theory for anyons (similar to superconductivity [\cite=SC]) represented by a scalar complex field φ together with a Chern-Simons term for an internal collective gauge field (a, also known as statistical gauge field) accounting for the long-range particle interactions [\cite=CS]. For a review in this topics see [\cite=review].

In the Landau-Ginzburg Chern-Simon theories the fractional statistics is imposed externally by fine-tuning the Chern-Simons coupling which is related to the filling fraction by [formula] [\cite=CS]. As for parity P and time-inversion T are explicitly violated both at level of the action and of the electromagnetic equations since relate scalar (or vector) quantities to pseudo-scalar (or pseudo-vector) quantities. In particular the internal field solution for the internal gauge field ai (a vector) is given in terms of a pseudo-vector quantity

[formula]

as well as the well-known electric Hall current (a vector) in the presence of an external electric field Ei is given by the pseudo-scalar quantity

[formula]

The internal gauge field is commonly interpreted as not being a true physical field and is not directly measured experimentally in this physical framework. However the electric current is directly measured and is physically meaningful. Hence equation ([\ref=CS_Hall]), although qualitatively correct is, from a more fundamental point of view, inconsistent: it is relating a physical vectorial current with a pseudo-vector quantity. In more simple terms we note that the Hall conductance must be a pseudo-scalar. The most straight forward solution is to consider the Chern-Simons coupling θk to be a pseudo-scalar (see for instance [\cite=Sing_2]), in this work we give another solution for this problem.

Extended Ue(1)  ×  Ug(1) electromagnetism was originally motivated by the work of Cabibbo and Ferrari [\cite=CF] and the possibility of the existence of magnetic monopoles [\cite=Sing_1] [\cite=dual] [\cite=CCN]. However has recently, in a very conservative framework, been justified at variational level (meaning at action level) in the presence of non-regular external electromagnetic fields (for example rotating magnetic fields) since the full Maxwell equations cannot be described in this situation by theories with only the standard gauge field (photon) [\cite=pseudo]. In addition this theory has also been successfully applied to plasmon mass generation (Schwinger-Anderson mechanism) [\cite=mass] and in planar system allow a description of electromagnetism in terms of the full vectorial electric and magnetic fields [\cite=planar] instead of only the transverse magnetic field and the longitudinal electric fields. Specificaly the bare gauge action for extended Ue(1)  ×  Ug(1) electromagnetism containing both the standard external gauge field A (photon) and an internal gauge field C (pseudo-photon) in planar systems reads [\cite=Witten] [\cite=Schwarz] [\cite=planar]

[formula]

and the electromagnetic field definitions read [\cite=planar]

[formula]

where the tilde indicate that the respective physical fields are defined in terms of the pseudo-photon C and Ẽ and B stand for the components of the electromagnetic fields orthogonal to the planar system. Hence the motivation for the present study is two-fold, both to test extended Ue(1)  ×  Ug(1) electromagnetism in a new framework and to solve the above stated inconsistence in the vector/pseudo-vector nature of the electromagnetic equations. In the remaining of this work we are going to develop a Landau-Ginzburg Chern-Simons model containing pseudo-photons taking the following assumptions:

The internal standard gauge field a (photon) is effectively excluded from the theory by some sort of condensation mechanism or effective screening mechanism not discussed in this work. This ensures compatibility of the model both with the pseudo nature of the Laughlin's wave solution and macroscopical P and T invariance.

φ is a complex field representing a many particle state of anyons, composite electrons carrying each an electric charge density eα (or equivalently electric flux depending on the interpretation) and a magnetic flux density g. Here g is the coupling constant associated to the pseudo-vector C which corresponds to the unit of magnetic charge [\cite=dual].

φ*φ is real and transforms as a scalar under the discrete symmetries P and T.

The coupling to the electric flux is done trough the effective constant (non-dynamical and space-time independent) scalar α that accounts for the amount of electric flux of each anyon.

The coupling to the magnetic flux is done trough the effective constant (non-dynamical and space-time independent) pseudo-scalar [formula] that accounts for the amount of magnetic flux of each anyon. Being a pseudo-scalar we ensure that the coupling maintains the Lagrangian P and T invariant [\cite=Sing_2].

As we will show in the remaining of this work this construction solves the stated inconsistence in the vector/pseudo-vector nature of the electromagnetic equations, in particular of the electric Hall current ([\ref=CS_Hall]). Also for the model developed in this work we obtain the new features:

theoretical justification for the experimentally measured fractional charge [formula] for every filling fraction [formula] independently of p [\cite=exp_charge]. This is due to the electric flux density being attributed to electric vortexes of pseudo-photons instead of the electric charge of the electron.

theoretical justification for the low energy contribution to Laughlin's wave function solutions due to the negative energy contributions of pseudo-photon excitations (which are ghost or phantoms).

equivalence between Dirac's quantization condition [\cite=Dirac] and the experimentally verified quantization of magnetic flux [\cite=London] given directly in terms of the units charges e and g which is fully justified in the context of Ue(1)  ×  Ug(1) electromagnetism.

theoretical justification for the orthogonal electric potential due to pseudo-photon electric vortexes which may justify the experimental existence of BEC condensates in bi-layer electron-electron Hall systems instead of its existence in electron-hole Hall systems as originaly expected [\cite=BEC].

macroscopical P and T invariance in the planar system both at the level of the action and electromagnetic equations.

Given these results we conclude that we may be doing something right and that pseudo-photons do have a relevant role in Hall systems. Also this work is one more example of physical systems where pseudo-photons can be successfully applied and it is interesting that our results may also be related to other frameworks as for example BF theories describing effective topological superconductivity [\cite=AG]. A relevant issue to address in a future work is, based in the framework set in [\cite=planar], to derive a consistent microscopical theory in the framework of Ue(1)  ×  Ug(1) that accounts both for the anyon fractional statistics and to the effective screening of the internal photon field a [\cite=progress].

The Model with Pseudo-Photons

In the framework of Ue(1)  ×  Ug(1), a particle carrying both electric flux and magnetic flux must couple both to the A field (through its electric flux) and to the C field (through the magnetic flux). This is the case for anyons. We further remark that in a planar system an external measurement of magnetic and electric fluxes cannot, in principle, distinguish between a real physical charge and other objects such as flux tubes. In simple terms we recall that a charge is detected by measuring the electric flux that it generates. Hence we consider the Lagrangian L  =  Lφ,C  +  LC

[formula]

Here [formula] is the effective renormalized mass of the anyon and Lφ,C is given by equation ([\ref=S_AC]). Next we derive the stationary solutions for the equations of motion following the same procedure of the works [\cite=CS]. We note that the contribution of the kinetic terms for the equations of motion are null for stationary solutions. For external electric field Ei =  - ∂iA0 and external magnetic field B =  - εij∂iAj / 2 we obtain

[formula]

with the external magnetic field locked to B = gN (from the equation of motion for C0) and μ  =  λN / 2 (from the equation of motion for φ). The equations of motion for A0 hold that

[formula]

with solution

[formula]

We note that in theories with both photons and pseudo-photons the roles of each of the gauge fields A and C are reversed with respect to the definitions of the electric and magnetic fields as defined in ([\ref=field_defs]). Therefore the physical interpretation of equation ([\ref=C_sol]) is that the anyon gas reacts to the external magnetic field by inducing a transverse electric field. Also it is important to stress that the solution ([\ref=C_sol]) transforms as a pseudo-vector under P and T accordingly to C being a pseudo-vector as opposed to the usual solutions ([\ref=a_CS]) for the standard internal photon. The equations of motion for Ai hold the Hall conductance equation

[formula]

For last we note that in the absence of external electric field the equation of motion for Ci are identically null. When the external electric field is turn on, these equations hold a magnetic flux current, this is simply understood by noting that a current of anyons is both an electric current and a current of the attached flux tubes.

By considering the Dirac quantization condition [\cite=Dirac]

[formula]

for n = 1 we obtain, in terms of the magnetic flux quantum Φ0 = h / 2e, that

[formula]

Therefore, from ([\ref=ji_C]), the Hall conductance is a pseudo-scalar quantity given by

[formula]

hence proportional to the ratio between the electric charge and the magnetic flux of the anyon. Let us now use an adaptation from Haldane and Halperin [\cite=frac] arguments (see also [\cite=Laughlin_3]). We may consider that the anyons have a fractional electric charge corresponding to α = 1 / (2n - 1) and a magnetic flux corresponding to  = 1 / p such that we obtain the fractional Hall conductances

[formula]

and the respective Landau level filling fraction νp,n  =  α  /   = p / (2n - 1). This construction is in close agreement with the original Laughlin wave function [\cite=Laughlin_2] and the experimental verification of fractional charge quantization of 1 / (2n - 1) independently of p [\cite=exp_charge]. Only in these last equations we explicitly considered h, we note that in the remaining of this work we are considering natural units [formula] (which affects only momenta and energy definitions).

We stress that, although we obtain the same quantitative results of standard Chern-Simons theories, the physical content of the model is completly distinct. Also as already pointed out the equations for this model are consistent in relation to the transformations of the quantities under P and T, in particular the solution ([\ref=C_sol]) is consistently a pseudo-vector and the Hall conductance σ̂H ([\ref=HA_H]) is consistently a pseudo-scalar quantity.

Flux Tubes, Fractional Charges and Negative Energy Contributions

In Landau-Ginzburg Chern-Simons models there are finite energy solutions magnetic flux tubes for the standard internal photon field a [\cite=CS] [\cite=NO]. In our model, we have instead finite energy (electric) vortex solutions for the pseudo-photon field given by

[formula]

Considering one of such vortex, the equation of motion for A0 reads

[formula]

with N = φ*φ such that by considering the redefinition α  →  α' we obtain

[formula]

where we have assumed that the Dirac condition holds [\cite=Dirac]. Given this result we confirm our original assumption: α simply accounts for the density (per electron) of electric vortexes in the system, hence eαN is the effective physical electric flux generated by the system. This result is as expected in agreement with solution ([\ref=C_sol]).

We have assumed that the internal gauge field is excluded from the macroscopical theory. Let us assume that, although not a dynamical field, the effect of the a field is present trough vortexes solutions of the type

[formula]

which carry a multiple of the unit of magnetic flux quanta. Considering the addition of one of such vortex to the system, the equations of motion for Ci read

[formula]

where again we have replaced φ*φ = N. Then we can consider the redefinition   →  ' obtaining

[formula]

where again we considered Dirac's quantization condition ([\ref=Dirac]). This result confirms our original assumption of interpreting the pseudo-scalar [formula] as accounting for the magnetic flux density (per electron) of vortexes in the system such that gN stands for effective magnetic flux generated by the system. In addition it also shows that the magnetic flux tubes are due to the internal gauge field a, i.e. the standard photon. The condensation or screening effect is however not explained at all by this construction, as we have put forward in [\cite=planar] a microscopical description must be developed in order to fully understand and describe it. Here we simply show that the existence of magnetic vortexes justifies our original assumptions when setting up the model.

It is interesting to note that, in our framework, electric flux tubes are equivalent to quasi-holes excitations (phantom excitations [\cite=Laughlin_2]). These excitations decrease the electric charge and hold lower energies for the configuration [\cite=Laughlin_2] [\cite=frac]. Furthermore, in the framework of Ue(1)  ×  Ug(1) electromagnetism, these vortex configurations correspond to excitations of the pseudo-photon. This is actually consistent with the fact that the pseudo-photon is, quantum mechanically, a ghost [\cite=dual] (or a phantom). Hence excitations of this field contribute negatively to the energy of the state. More specifically let us consider the kinetic terms of action ([\ref=S_AC]) such that the potential energy due to the orthogonal components of the electromagnetic internal fields reads [\cite=planar] [\cite=dual]

[formula]

where Ẽ = G12  =  ∂1C2  -  ∂1C2, b = f12  =  ∂1a2  -  ∂1a2 and [formula] is the effective thickness of the system [\cite=planar]. For a giving electric vortex density α = 1 / (2m - 1), considering the effective vortex area σm and for simplicity setting the thickness to unit, from ([\ref=vortex_C]), we obtain the same negative energy density contribution of Laughlin [\cite=Laughlin_2]

[formula]

As expected this is the negative contribution from the quasi-holes and corresponds to a short-range -   ln (r) interaction. The remaining terms that contributes to the potential energy are positive and may be explained due to the interaction between several electric vortexes. These can be obtained by higher order corrections on powers of σm [\cite=Laughlin_2] [\cite=frac]. We note that accordingly to the original references we are in the presence of a strong coupled plasma, this is consistent with the coupling constant being g  ~  1 / e. In order to justify the effective finite size of the vortexes, hence finite energy contribution due to the Maxwell terms, it is necessary either to consider miscroscopical arguments [\cite=progress] or the effects due to the thickness of the system, in the works [\cite=thick] it was shown that the thickness effects correctly render a ln(r) short range interaction and a 1 / r long range interaction.

Hence we have justified our interpretation of the coupling constants α and [formula] as the measurable macroscopical densities of electric and magnetic fluxes in the planar system as well as put forward a possible theoretical justification for the negative energy contribution of the Laughlin wave functions in the framework of Ue(1)  ×  Ug(1) electromagnetism.
