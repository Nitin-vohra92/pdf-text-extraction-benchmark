Kolmogorov and Kelvin-Wave Cascades of Superfluid Turbulence at T = 0: What is in Between ?

Nowadays, superfluid turbulence [\cite=Donnelly] [\cite=Cambridge]--a structured or non-structured tangle of quantized vortex lines--is attracting much attention [\cite=Vinen06], stimulated, in particular, by advances in experimental techniques allowing studies of different turbulent regimes in diverse superfluid systems, such as 4He [\cite=Cambridge] [\cite=Lathrop], 3He-B [\cite=3He_Nature] [\cite=Pickett], and Bose-Einstein condensates of ultacold atoms [\cite=Cambridge] [\cite=BEC]. In superfluids at T = 0, vorticity can only exist in the form of topological defects--vortex lines of microscopic thickness, the circulation of velocity around which being equal to the liquid-specific quantum κ. Speaking generally, the dynamical mechanisms governing superfluid turbulence are fundamentally different from those of classical turbulence (see, e.g., recent review [\cite=Vinen06] and references therein).

A new wave of interest in dynamics of superfluid turbulence came with the experiment by Maurer and Tabeling [\cite=Maurer_Tabeling], who observed that superfluid turbulence in 4He formed by counter-rotating discs is indistinguishable from classical turbulence at large length scales, in particular, exhibiting the classical Kolmogorov cascade. Shortly, the same effect was found in superfluid turbulence generated by a towed grid [\cite=Skrbek]. In the experiments [\cite=Maurer_Tabeling] [\cite=Skrbek], the fraction of normal component is considerable making analysis of vortex tangle dynamics and structure significantly complicated [\cite=Vinen2000] [\cite=Vinen_Niemela]. (Considerations regarding possible energy spectra in this case are presented in Ref. [\cite=En_spectra].) However, the similarity between classical and superfluid turbulence exists even at practically zero temperature, which was first observed in numerical simulations [\cite=Nore] [\cite=Tsubota_2002] [\cite=Barenghi_2002], and, just recently, for the first time confirmed by measurements in 3He-B [\cite=Pickett].

By the nature of a cascade regime, implying that the kinetic times get progressively shorter down the hierarchy of length scales, instantaneous structure of turbulence follows the evolution at the largest length scales (typically of order of system size), where the energy flux (per unit mass) ε is formed. At very low temperatures, due to the absence of frictional dissipation, the flux ε must be carried down to scales significantly smaller than the (related to ε) typical separation between the vortex lines l0. At small enough length scales, the energy flux is carried by pure Kelvin-wave cascades on separate vortex lines [\cite=SvK_2004] [\cite=Vinen_2003], the cutoff being due to sound radiation [\cite=Vinen2000] [\cite=Vinen2001] [\cite=SvK_vortex_phonon].

The fact that superfluid turbulence at large compared to l0 length scales may be consistent with the classical Kolmogorov law is not surprising (a formal proof is mentioned below). It is well known [\cite=Donnelly] that macroscopic velocity profile of a rapidly rotated superfluid mimics solid-body rotation, which is accomplished by formation of a dense array of vortex lines aligned along the rotation axis. By the same mechanism, "stirring" a superfluid one can produce vorticity in the course-grained up to length scales larger than l0 superfluid velocity field, indistinguishable from that of a normal fluid, the underlying vortex tangle being organized in polarized "bundles" of vortex lines. What turns out to be a puzzle [\cite=Bottleneck], however, is how the vortex tangle looks like when one zooms in down to scales of order of the interline separation l0, where the vorticity is essentially discrete.

In this Letter, we analyze the structure of turbulence at all length scales tracing the transformation of the classical regime, described by the Kolmogorov law at large length scales, into the quantized regime, in which the discreteness of vortex lines is important, in the fundamental case of zero temperature. The analysis relies on the large parameter

[formula]

where a0 is the vortex core radius. In realistic 4He experiments, Λ  ~  15. The attention to the problem of linking the two regimes was drawn recently by L'vov et al. [\cite=Bottleneck], who realized that it is impossible to directly cross over from Kolmogorov regime to the pure Kelvin-wave cascade, and put forward the idea of a bottleneck, with specific dynamical implications. The Achilles' heel of the treatment of Ref. [\cite=Bottleneck] is taking it for granted [\cite=Vinen2000] [\cite=Vinen_Niemela] that the coarse-grained macroscopic description of quantized vorticity remains valid down to the scale of l0.

We show that the locally-induced motion of the vortex lines radically changes dynamical picture already at the scale

[formula]

with the interline separation related to the energy flux by

[formula]

In the range of wavelength r0  >  λ  >  λ*,

[formula]

there takes place a chain of three cascade regimes, in which the energy flux ε is carried by locally-induced motion combined with vortex line reconnections. The three regimes are distinguished by their specific types of reconnections: (i) reconnections of vortex-line bundles, (ii) reconnections between nearest-neighbor vortex lines, (iii) self-reconnections on single vortex lines--the mechanism introduced earlier by one of us [\cite=Sv_95] in the context of the decay of non-structured superfluid turbulence. The existence of the regime (iii) means unavoidable production of vortex rings of the typical size λ* at a rate immediately following from ([\ref=l_0]) by conservation of energy. Namely, ~  κΛ1 / 2 / l20 rings are emitted per unit time in the characteristic volume of l30. Remarkably, this rate is ~  Λ3 / 2 times smaller than the rate of vortex ring production characteristic of non-structured superfluid turbulence [\cite=Sv_95] [\cite=SvK_2004].

For realistic values of Λ, sharp distinction between the three sub-regimes is likely to be lost, although characteristic features of strong turbulence, such as generation of a spectrum of vortex rings by the mechanism (iii), might manifest themselves. At the wavelength scale λ*, self-reconnections cease and the weak-turbulent regime sets in, with purely non-linear Kelvin-wave cascade [\cite=SvK_2004]. This regime covers a significant part of the inertial range until eventually, at the scale [\cite=SvK_vortex_phonon]

[formula]

(c is the sound velocity), the cascade is cut off due to the radiation of sound by Kelvin waves. With κ / c  ~  a0 we have [formula].

The structure of turbulence is summarized in Fig. ([\ref=f1]). We emphasize that the notion of energy spectrum E(k), where E(k)dk gives the energy per unit mass associated with variations of fluid velocity over length scales ~  k- 1 in the interval dk, is practically meaningful only in the classical regime. In the quantized regime, the relevant degrees of freedom are waves on vortex lines, while even a perfectly straight vortex line has a nontrivial spectrum E(k)  ~  k. On the experimental side, recently introduced vortex line visualization technique in 4He [\cite=Lathrop] could provide the most direct probe for the quantized regime.

Analysis. The key to understanding vortex dynamics at zero temperature is given by Kelvin-Helmholtz's theorem, which states that a vortex line element moves with local fluid velocity. Mathematically, this is reflected in the Biot-Savart equation [\cite=Donnelly], Here [formula] is the superfluid velocity field, [formula] is the time-evolving radius-vector of the vortex line element, the dot denotes differentiation with respect to time, the vector 0 has the same physical meaning as [formula], understood as an integration variable, and the integration is along all the vortex lines. In the long-wave limit, when discreteness of vortex lines is irrelevant, Eqs. ([\ref=BS]) can be coarse grained: The second equation turns into Biot-Savart resolvent restoring the field [formula] from its curl, [formula]. The first equation coarse-grains into Euler's equation for incompressible fluid,

[formula]

Here the first term in the r.h.s. comes from translation of the vortex array by the flow, the second term originates from bending of the array by velocity gradient. This formally proves the equivalence of (structured) superfluid and normal-ideal-incompressible-fluid turbulence. For a non-structured tangle, coarse graining trivially leads to [formula].

For our purposes, it is instructive to formally decompose the integral ([\ref=BS]) into the self-induced part, [formula], for which the integration is restricted to the vortex line containing the element [formula], and the remaining contribution induced by all the other lines [formula],

[formula]

Since the velocities [formula] and [formula] define the r.h.s. of Eq. ([\ref=BS]), the competition between them is crucial for the problem.

The leading contribution to [formula] is given by the local induction approximation (LIA), which reduces the integral over the vortex line to its local differential characteristics,

[formula]

where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to the arc length and R is the typical curvature radius. A necessary condition of applicability of the LIA is ΛR  ≫  1. Taking into account that ΛR is a very weak function of R, we shall treat it as a constant of typical value ΛR  ~  Λ. Note, however, that despite the fact that the condition ([\ref=Lambda]) is typically well satisfied, using the LIA is not always appropriate.--Being an integrable model, LIA does not capture reconnection-free (purely non-linear) kinetics of Kelvin waves [\cite=SvK_2004].

To determine the crossover scale r0, consider the structure of the vortex tangle in the classical regime. By the definition of r0, at length scales r  ≫  r0 turbulence mimics classical vorticity by taking on the form of a dense coherently moving array of vortex lines bent at curvature radius of order r. Velocity field of this configuration obeys the Kolmogorov law

[formula]

Here and below the subscript r means typical variation of a field over distance ~  r. On the other hand, the value of vr is fixed by the quantization of velocity circulation around a contour of radius r, namely vrr  ~  κnrr2, where nr is the areal density of vortex lines responsible for vorticity at the scale r. Note, that scale invariance requires that on top of vorticity at the scale r there be a fine structure of vortex bundles of smaller sizes, so that, mathematically, nrr2 is the difference between huge numbers of vortex lines crossing the area of the contour r in opposite directions. The quantity nr is related to the flux by

[formula]

The underlying dynamics of a single vortex line in the bundle is governed by [formula] and [formula]. While, by its definition, vIr  ~  vr, which is given by Eq. ([\ref=Kolmogorov]), the self-induced part is determined by the curvature radius r of the vortex line according to Eq. ([\ref=LIA]),

[formula]

At length scales where [formula], the vortex lines in the bundle move coherently with the same velocity [formula]. However, at the scale r0  ~  (Λ3κ3  /  ε)1 / 4, the self-induced motion of the vortex line becomes comparable to the collective motion, [formula]. At this scale, individual vortex lines start to behave independently from each other and thus r0 gives the lower cutoff of the inertial region of the Kolmogorov spectrum ([\ref=Kolmogorov]).

Since r0 is the size of the smallest classical eddies, the areal density of vortex lines at this scale is given by the typical interline separation, nr0  ~  1 / l20. With Eq. ([\ref=n_r]), we arrive at ([\ref=r_0-l_0])-([\ref=l_0]).

At the scale r0, turbulence consists of randomly oriented vortex line bundles of size r0, left by the classical regime. The typical number of vortices in the bundle is given by nr0r20  ~  Λ. The length r0 plays the role of a correlation radius in the sense that relative orientation of two vortex lines becomes uncorrelated only if they are a distance [formula] apart. On the other hand, the crossover to the quantized regime means that each line starts moving according to its geometric shape, as described by Eq. ([\ref=LIA]). Therefore, reconnections, at least between separate bundles, are inevitable and, as we show below, capable of sustaining the flux ε.

Reconnections play the leading role at [formula]. Although this region is relatively narrow as compared to the whole Kelvin-wave inertial range, it is significantly large in the absolute units. Before going into the details of the reconnection-assisted regimes, we describe the remaining and dominant region of the cascade. As was shown by the authors [\cite=SvK_2004], at a sufficiently small wavelength, a strongly turbulent cascade of Kelvin waves is replaced by a purely non-linear cascade, in which the reconnections are exponentially suppressed. The spectrum of Kelvin-wave amplitudes bk, k  ~  λ- 1, in the non-linear cascade has the form

[formula]

where Θ is the flux of energy per unit vortex line length supported by the non-linear cascade. The value of λ* can be determined by matching the energy flux ε with Θ  /  ρl20, where bk  ~  k- 1  ~  λ*. With Eq. ([\ref=l_0]), we then obtain Eq. ([\ref=lambda_*]).

Kelvin waves decay with emitting phonons [\cite=Vinen2000]. For Kelvin waves of wavenumber ~  k, the power of sound emission per unit line length is given by [\cite=SvK_vortex_phonon]

[formula]

This dissipation mechanism is negligibly weak all the way down to wavelengths of order [formula], given by Eq. ([\ref=lambda_ph]), where Πk  /  ρl20 becomes comparable to ε. The scale [formula] gives the lower dissipative cutoff of the Kelvin wave cascade.

Now we focus on the strongly turbulent regimes at [formula]. The key quantity here is the energy transferred to a lower scale after one reconnection of vortex lines at the scale k- 1, which, following Ref. [\cite=Sv_95], can be written as

[formula]

Here, f(γ) is a dimensionless function of the angle γ at which the vortex lines cross, γ = 0 corresponding to parallel lines. Its asymptotic form is

[formula]

Although, at the scale r0, there is already no coupling between vortex lines to stabilize the bundles, they should still move coherently--the geometry of neighboring lines at this scale is essentially the same over distances ~  r0--until the whole bundles cross each other. It is possible, however, that vortex lines within the bundle reconnect. One can show that such processes can not lead to any significant redistribution of energy, and thus to a deformation of the bundle at the scale r0, because they happen at small angles so that the energy ([\ref=energy-reconn]) is too small. Indeed, the dimensional upper bound on the rate at which two lines at distance l  ≪  r0 can cross each other is, from Eq. ([\ref=LIA]), Λκ / r0l, while the actual value should be much smaller due to the strong correlations between line geometries. Taking into account that the number of lines in the bundle is (r0 / l0)2 and that γ  ~  l / r0, the contribution to the energy flux from these processes is bounded by (l / r0)ε.

Crossing of the bundles results in reconnections between their vortex lines and Kelvin waves with somewhat smaller wavelength λ are generated. The coherence of the initial bundles implies that the waves on different vortex lines must be generated coherently. Thus, at the scale [formula], vortex lines should be also organized in bundles of length λ that are bent with the amplitude of the Kelvin waves bk, k  ~  λ- 1, while the correlation radius for vortex line configurations in the transversal direction is ~  bk. Then, reconnections between the bundles at the scale λ transport the energy to a lower scale. The cascade of bundles should repeat itself self-similarly in a range of wavelength l0  ≪  k- 1,bk  <  r0, in which the notion of bundles is meaningful. The spectrum of Kelvin waves bk in this regime can be obtained from the condition [formula], where k is the energy flux per unit mass transported by the reconnections at the scale k- 1 given by

[formula]

Here, we take into account that the correlation volume is b2k / k, the Nk  ~  (bk / l0)2 is the number of vortex lines in the bundle, and τ- 1k  ~  Λκk2 is the rate at which the bundles cross. Physically, bk determines the typical crossing angle, γ  ~  bkk, thereby controlling the energy lost in one reconnection. Thus, the spectrum of Kelvin waves in the bundles is

[formula]

At the wavelength [formula], the amplitudes become of order of the interline separation bk  ~  l0 and the cascade of bundles is cut off. At this scale, bkk  ≪  1, so that the mechanism of self-reconnections is strongly suppressed. The kinetic times of the purely non-linear regime are too long to carry the flux ε [\cite=SvK_2004]. We thus conclude that at [formula] the cascade is supported by nearest-neighbor reconnections, the amplitudes bk being defined by the condition of constant energy flux per unit length and the crossover scale [formula] being associated with the condition [formula] meaning that at [formula] the self-crossing regime takes over. The observation crucial for understanding the particular mechanism of the cascade and thus finding bk is that each nearest-neighbor reconnection (happening at the rate [formula] per each line element of the length ~  λb) performs a sort of parallel processing of the cascade for each of the wavelength scales of the range
