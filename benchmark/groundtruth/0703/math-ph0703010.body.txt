Bessel functions of integer order in terms of hyperbolic functions

In this article we shall propose a simple formula expressing the modified Bessel functions of integer order, In, in terms of powers and hyperbolic functions of the same argument. It can be easily adapted for the Bessel functions Jn.

The starting point is the generalization of the Jacobi identity ([\cite=W] p.22) used in the calculation of lattice sums [\cite=1]:

[formula]

For w = 1 and N = 2, ([\ref=1]) gives a well-known formula:

[formula]

(see for instance [\cite=2], eq.9.6.39)

It is interesting to exploit ([\ref=1]) at w = 1, for larger values of N. For N = 4,

[formula]

and for N = 8:

[formula]

It is easy to see that, if the l.h.s. of these equations contains p hyperbolic cosines, it provides an exact expression for the series of I0(z), cut off at the z4p term. The generalization of ([\ref=4]) for N = 4p, with p - an arbitrary integer, is indeed:

[formula]

Because

[formula]

our result ([\ref=5]) can be written as:

[formula]

It is easy to obtain formulae similar to ([\ref=5]) for any modified Bessel function of integer order. Let us introduce the notations:

[formula]

and let us define the functions:

[formula]

We have:

Using recurrently the formula ([\cite=Gradst] 8.486.4):

[formula]

and the notation:

[formula]

we get:

For n = 1,2,3,4:

The general expressions are:

[formula]

We get:

[formula]

and the following recurrence relations for the coefficients [formula]

[formula]

Other general expressions of the coefficients are:

[formula]

Ignoring the series in the r.h.s. of ([\ref=14]), we get approximate expression for In. Let us give here these expressions for the value p = 2 and n = 0,1,2,3:
