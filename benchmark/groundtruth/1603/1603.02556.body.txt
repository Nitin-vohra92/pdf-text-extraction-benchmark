Local Lipschitz Stability for Inverse Robin Problems in Elliptic and Parabolic Systems

Key Words. Inverse Robin problems, local Lipschitz stability, elliptic and parabolic equations

Introduction

We are concerned in this work with the determination of a spatially dependent Robin coefficient in both stationary elliptic and time-dependent parabolic systems from measurement data on a partial boundary. This is a highly nonlinear inverse problem and arises in several applications of practical importance. The Robin coefficient may characterize the thermal properties of conductive materials on the interface or certain physical processes near the boundary, e.g., it represents the corrosion damage profile in corrosion detection [\cite=fang04][\cite=ing97], and indicates the thermal property in quenching processes [\cite=osm89].

For the description of the model problems that are considered in this work, we let Ω  ⊂  R2 be an open bounded and connected domain, with a boundary ∂Ω, which consists of two disjointed parts [formula]. Γi and Γa are respectively the part of the boundary that is inaccessible and accessible to experimental measurements. Then we shall consider the inverse Robin problems associated with the following elliptic boundary value problem

[formula]

and parabolic initial boundary value problem

[formula]

The coefficients [formula] and [formula] are the heat conductivity and radiation coefficient, satisfying that [formula] and [formula] in Ω, where a1,  a2 and c1,  c2 are positive constants. Functions f, g and h are the source strength, ambient temperature and heat flux respectively. Both coefficients [formula] in ([\ref=ch1]) and ([\ref=ch1t]) represent the Robin coefficients, which will be the focus of our interest and are assumed to stay in the following feasible constraint set:

[formula]

where γ and [formula] are two positive constants. For convenience, we often write the solutions of the systems ([\ref=ch1]) and ([\ref=ch1t]) as u(γ) to emphasize their dependence on the Robin coefficient γ.

We are now ready to formulate the inverse problems of our interest in this work.

Elliptic Inverse Robin Problem: recover the Robin coefficient [formula] in ([\ref=ch1]) on the inaccessible part Γi from the measurable data z of u on the accessible part Γa.

Parabolic inverse Robin problem: recover the Robin coefficient [formula] in ([\ref=ch1t]) on the inaccessible part Γi from the measurable data z of u on the accessible part Γa over the time range

Local Lipschitz stability for elliptic inverse Robin problem

In this section, we shall restructure the arguments in [\cite=chou04] for the local Lipschitz stability of the elliptic inverse Robin problem stated in the previous section so that the stability comes as a consequence of three basic conditions, which are described in three lemmas below. We first present the classical well-posedness of the forward system ([\ref=ch1]).

Let Ω be an open bounded and connected domain with a C2-boundary ∂Ω. We assume that a∈H1(Ω) and c∈L∞(Ω) with positive lower and upper bounds a1,a2 and c1,c2 respectively, and

[formula]

Then there exists a unique solution [formula] to system ([\ref=ch1]), with the estimates (cf. [\cite=lions72][\cite=chou04])

[formula]

The next lemma studies the differentiability of the solution u(γ) to system [\eqref=ch1] and gives its Fréchet derivative.

For any γ∈K and d∈L∞(Γi), let u(γ) and w̃  =  w̃(γ)∈H1(Ω) be respectively the solutions to the system [\eqref=ch1] and the following system:

[formula]

then u(γ) is continuously Fréchet differentiable and its derivative u'(γ)d at direction d∈L∞(Γi) is given by w̃(γ).

Proof. For any γ∈K and d∈L∞(Γi) such that γ + d∈K, let [formula]. Then we can easily see

[formula]

From estimate [\eqref=ch2] and the Sobolev embedding theorem, we obtain

[formula]

where [formula] satisfies the following elliptic equation

[formula]

Similarly, we can show from estimate [\eqref=ch2] and the Sobolev embedding theorem that

[formula]

Thus it follows directly that

[formula]

which means that u(γ) is Fréchet differentiable and u'(γ)d is its derivative.

Next, we verify the continuity of u'(γ)d. Let φ∈L∞(Γi), then [formula] satisfies

[formula]

Using estimate [\eqref=ch2] again, we derive

[formula]

clearly y converges to 0 in H1(Ω) when φ tends 0 in L ∞ (Γi). [formula]

Now let γ*∈K be the true Robin coefficient for the proposed elliptic Robin inverse problem and ω(d) satisfy the following elliptic system

[formula]

We define a bounded and linear operator from L2(Γi) to L2(Γi) as follows:

[formula]

N is bijective and [formula] is bounded.

Proof. It is obviously that N is injective. Now we prove N is surjective, which meas that for any φ∈L2(Γi), we want to seek d∈L2(Γi) such that N(d) = φ, i.e.,

[formula]

This identity leads to the following equation

[formula]

where O is an operator formed by O = BA, with the operators A and B given by

[formula]

From the definition of operator A, Sobolev embedding theorem and the estimate ([\ref=ch2]), we know that

[formula]

Since H1(Γi) is compactly embedded in L2(Γi), we deduce that A is compact. On the other hand, as γ*∈K, we know the operator B is bounded. Hence the operator O = BA is also compact.

Next, we claim that 1 does not belong to the spectrum of the compact operator O. Then by the Fredholm alternative theorem [\cite=con03], we know that (O - I)- 1 is linear and bounded, and therefore d = (O - I)- 1(φ).

Indeed, if 1 is an eigenvalue of O, then we can find an element d∈L2(Γi), not identically equal to zero, such that O(d) = d, which is equivalent to N(d) = 0. Then by the definition of N, we have [formula] on Γi. Moreover, noting that w(d) is the solution of the system ([\ref=ch4]), we can easily verify that w(d) is also the solution of the following elliptic system

[formula]

Therefore we know w(d) = 0 in Ω, so is d. But this contradicts the fact that d is an eigenfunction.

As N is linear, bounded and bijective, then by the Open Mapping Theorem [\cite=con03], we know that the inverse N- 1 exists and [formula] is bounded. [formula]

Finally, we present the following theorem for the local Lipschitz stability, which was proved in [\cite=chou04] for the simple elliptic model [\eqref=j1] under the three basic conditions: the solution u(γ) to system [\eqref=j1] belongs to [formula]; u(γ) is continuously Fréchet differentiable; and the operator N is an isomorphism. Clearly these conditions follow now directly from Lemmas [\ref=lem:well]-[\ref=lem:sur] for the more general elliptic system [\eqref=ch1]. For convenience, we shall write for any positive constant b that

[formula]

Assume that u(γ*)  ≥  c0 > 0 on Γi, then there exists a positive constant b such that the following stability estimate holds:

[formula]

Local Lipschitz stability for parabolic inverse Robin problem

In this section, we shall establish the local Lipschitz stability for the parabolic inverse Robin problem formulated in the Introduction. We first give a preliminary lemma for recalling the classical well-posedness of the forward system ([\ref=ch1t]).

(see [\cite=lions72]) Let Ω be an open bounded and connected domain with a C2-boundary ∂Ω, [formula], [formula] with positive lower and upper bounds a1,a2, c1,c2 respectively, [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula], then there exists a unique solution [formula] to system ([\ref=ch1t]) and it satisfies

[formula]

For our later use, we give the following norm equivalence lemma.

The norm [formula] defined by

[formula]

is equivalent to the standard norm [formula] on H1(Ω).

Then we study the differentiability of the solution u(γ) to system [\eqref=ch1t] and give its Fréchet derivative.

For any γ∈K and d∈L∞(Γi), let u(γ) and w̃  =  w̃(γ)∈L2(0,T;H1(Ω)) be respectively the solutions to the system [\eqref=ch1t] and the following system:

[formula]

then u(γ) is continuously Fréchet differentiable and its derivative u'(γ)d at direction d∈L∞(Γi) is given by w̃(γ).

Proof. For any γ∈K, d∈L∞(Γi) such that γ + d∈K, let [formula], then

[formula]

From estimate [\eqref=c1] and the Sobolev embedding theorem, we obtain

[formula]

As [formula] satisfies the following parabolic equation

[formula]

Similarly, we can show from estimate [\eqref=c1] and the Sobolev embedding theorem that

[formula]

Thus it follows directly that

[formula]

which means that u(γ) is Fréchet differentiable and u'(γ)d is its derivative.

Next, we verify the continuity of u'(γ)d. Let φ∈L∞(Γi), then [formula] satisfies

[formula]

Once again estimate [\eqref=c1] implies that

[formula]

which y converges to 0 in H1(Ω) when [formula] tends to 0. [formula]

Now let γ*∈K be the true Robin coefficient for the proposed parabolic Robin inverse problem and assume u(γ*)  ≥  c0 > 0 on Γi  ×  [0,T]. Then we introduce a function ω(p) for any p∈L2(Γi), which satisfies the following parabolic system

[formula]

With the help of ω(p), we can define a bounded and linear operator from L2(Γi) to L2(0,T;L2(Γi)):

[formula]

The operator N is bijective and [formula] is bounded.

Proof. It is easy to see the injectiveness of N. Now we prove N is surjective, which meas that for any element φ∈L2(0,T;L2(Γi)), we want to seek a function p∈L2(Γi) such that N(p) = φ, i.e.,

[formula]

This identity leads to the following equation

[formula]

where O = BA and the operators A and B are given by

[formula]

From the definition of operator A, Sobolev embedding theorem and the estimate ([\ref=c1]), we know that

[formula]

Since L2(0,T;H1(Γi)) is compactly embedded in L2(0,T;L2(Γi)), we deduce that A is compact. On the other hand, as γ*∈K and u(γ*)  ≥  c0 > 0 on Γi  ×  [0,T], we have

[formula]

which implies that the operator B is bounded, and thus the operator O = BA is also compact.

Next, we claim that 1 does not belong to the spectrum of the compact operator O. Then by the Fredholm alternative theorem [\cite=con03], we know that (O - I)- 1 exists and is bounded, and therefore [formula].

Indeed, if 1 is an eigenvalue of O, then we can find an element p∈L2(Γi) that is not identically equal to zero such that O(p) = p, which with [\eqref=c4] imply [formula] on Γi  ×  [0,T]. As u(γ*)  ≥  c0 > 0 on Γi  ×  [0,T], then we have φ = 0, so is N(p) = 0. Then by the definition of N, we have [formula] on Γi  ×  [0,T]. Moreover, noting that w(p) is the solution of the system ([\ref=c3]), we know that w(p) is also the solution of the following parabolic system

[formula]

Therefore, we get w(p) = 0 in Ω  ×  [0,T] and then pu(γ*) = 0. Since u(γ*)  ≥  c0 > 0 on Γi  ×  [0,T], we get p = 0. But this contradicts the fact that p is an eigenfunction.

As N is linear, bounded and bijective, then by the Open Mapping Theorem, we know that N- 1 exists and [formula] is bounded. [formula]

We are now ready to establish the local Lipschitz stability for the parabolic inverse Robin problem.

Assume that u(γ*)  ≥  c0 > 0 on Γi  ×  [0,T], then there exists a constant b > 0 such that

[formula]

Proof. Let ε > 0, we denote the solution of system [\eqref=ch1t] by uε(γ) when (f,g,h,u0) is replaced by (εf,εg,εh,εu0). Clearly we see uε(γ) = εu(γ), and therefore uε(γ*)  ≥  εc0 > 0 on Γi  ×  [0,T].

We now consider on L2(Γi) the equivalent norm defined by

[formula]

In what follows we use the notation L2ε(Γi) when L2(Γi) is equipped with the norm [formula]. We introduce an important mapping

[formula]

and will show below that θε(γ*) is a C1-diffeomorphism. Indeed, as uε(γ*) is continuously Fréchet-differentiable, then we get θε(γ*) is Fréchet-differentiable and [formula], where vε(γ*)p is the solution of the following system

[formula]

Noting the definition of w(p) in [\eqref=c3] and the fact that uε(γ*) = εu(γ*), it is easy to see that vε(γ*)p = εw(p), and therefore we obtain θε'(γ*) = εN by the definitions of N in [\eqref=c7] and θε'(γ*). Hence we know θε'(γ*) is an isomorphism as N is an isomorphism and

[formula]

and it follows from lemma [\ref=lem:sur2] that

[formula]

Then by the inverse function theorem [\cite=dep03] we find that θε(γ*) is a C1-diffeomorphism on a neighborhood of γ*, consequently θε(γ*)- 1 is locally Lipschitz continuous and [formula] [formula]. Thus, there exists a neighborhood N(γ*,b) of γ* such that the Lipschitz constant is less equal to [formula], i.e., for any γ1,γ2∈N(γ*,b), it holds that

[formula]

Recalling the definition of u(γ) in [\eqref=ch1t], we have the following identity on Γi:

[formula]

Then it follows readily from the definition of the norm [formula] and the upper bound of any γ∈K that

[formula]

Further using the Sobolev embedding theorem and the estimate [\eqref=c1], we derive

[formula]

Taking the above estimate and [\eqref=c9] in [\eqref=c8] yields

[formula]

Now choosing ε0 > 0 such that 1 - C1ε > 0 for all 0 < ε  ≤  ε0, then we obtain

[formula]

where (ε) = C2 / (ε(1 - C1ε)).

Next we estimate φε: = uε(γ1) - uε(γ2). We first use the Sobolev embedding theorem and the equivalent norm [formula] defined in Lemma [\ref=lem:equi] to deduce

[formula]

Noting that φε solves the following parabolic system

[formula]

we know

[formula]

Applying this estimate to [\eqref=c11], we derive

[formula]

But using estimates [\eqref=c10] and [\eqref=c13], we obtain

[formula]

Noting (ε)ε2 = C2ε / (1 - C1ε) tends to 0 as ε  →  0, we can fix ε*∈(0,ε0] such that 1 - (ε*)C4ε2* > 0 and obtain

[formula]

where [formula].

Now using the equivalence between the norms [formula] and [formula] and the relations uε*(γ1) = ε*u(γ1) and uε*(γ2) = ε*u(γ2), we deduce

[formula]

which completes the desired estimate. [formula]
