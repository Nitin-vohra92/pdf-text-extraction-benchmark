Tree-level equivalence between a Lorentz-violating extension of QED and its dual model in electron-electron scattering.

Introduction

In some situations it is possible to establish relations between a class of models which are essentially different but that are equivalent in describing the physical behavior of a system. These are called dual models. This concept of duality is very useful, because there are some physical properties which are hidden in one model but are explicit in its dual theory. For example, the relation between electric and magnetic couplings are implemented by the dual mapping of a weakly-coupled theory in a strongly-coupled one.

Historically, the first well established dual correspondence has been formulated by Deser and Jackiw, between the three-dimensional spacetime self-dual and Maxwell-Chern-Simons models [\cite=DJ]. Besides, this duality was discussed as a part of a wide class of models in [\cite=Nieuw]. The subject was developed since then with the elaboration of different techniques to attain the duality between models [\cite=review]. Among the approaches to obtain physically equivalent models, we can cite the master action method [\cite=Malacarne] and the gauge embedding technique [\cite=Anacleto]. In the first approach, the so-called master action involves two vector fields and the dual models are obtained with the use of the equations of motion for each one of the fields. In the gauge embedding procedure (also called Noether dualization method), on the other hand, a gauge theory is obtained from a self-dual model by the use of iterative embedding Noether counterterms, which are on mass shell vanishing terms. The Noether dualization method (NDM) is based on the idea of a local lifting of a global symmetry, which was important for the construction of component-field supergravity actions [\cite=Nieuw2] [\cite=Ferrara1] [\cite=Ferrara2].

The gauging iterative Noether Dualization Method has been shown to be effective in establishing dualities between some models [\cite=Ilha2]. This method provides a strong suggestion of duality, since it furnishes the expected result in the paradigmatic duality between the self-dual and Maxwell-Chern-Simons models in three dimensions. Furthermore, the procedure has been applied in the context of Lorentz-violating models with interesting results [\cite=Bota], [\cite=Petrov], [\cite=Fargnoli], [\cite=dual-LV].

However, an intriguing result has been shown to be general when NDM is applied to Procca-like models [\cite=scarp-epl]. The gauge model obtained from the dualization algorithm, although sharing with the original theory the physical spectrum, acquires ghost modes. More precisely, the gauge model obtained by means of NDM encompasses the physical spectrum of the original Procca-like theory and, in addition, it possesses, with the wrong sign, the spectrum of the corresponding massless model. This was shown to be true even for Lorentz-breaking theories. In [\cite=scarp-epl], it was obtained a relation between the propagators of dual models which shed some light on this fact.

Alternatives to avoid the emergency of ghosts in the process of dualization were studied [\cite=Dalmazi1], [\cite=Dalmazi2], [\cite=Dalmazi3], [\cite=Dalmazi4]. In some cases, the price to be paid is the lost of locality [\cite=Dalmazi1]. For a model with a spin-2 self-dual field in three spacetime dimensions, it was shown that the dual theory achieved by NDM does not suffer with the presence of ghosts [\cite=Dalmazi4].

In [\cite=Fargnoli], it was considered the dualization of a CPT-even model which includes Lorentz-breaking kinetic and mass terms. It was found a generalization of the relation of [\cite=scarp-epl], with new terms. The existence of ghost modes in the dualized model is kind of uncomfortable if one cannot show that the nonphysical modes decouple and have no dynamics. A possible analysis is the study of the saturated propagator which makes use of the current conservation to discard the nondynamical poles. However, it is desirable to see how it works in a practical calculation, like in a quantum process.

In this paper, we reassess the model of [\cite=Fargnoli], with the inclusion of the fermionic and the interaction sectors. The dualization by gauge embedding is carried out and the dual gauge invariant theory is obtained. In addition to the action achieved in the previous work, new interaction terms are generated, which are nonminimal. In order to check the decoupling of the nonphysical modes, S-matrix amplitudes for the electron-electron scattering are calculated. We show that nontrivial cancelations occur in the calculation with the dualized action, such that the perturbative equivalence is established at tree-level.

The paper is organized as follows. In section II, we describe and justify the model under analysis and, further, obtain by the Noether dualization technique its gauge invariant dual theory. In section III, the tree level calculation of the electron-electron scattering is performed and the perturbative equivalence of the models is verified. The concluding comments are enclosed in section IV.

Description of the model and dualization

In the present work, we consider the CPT-even Lorentz-breaking model of [\cite=Fargnoli], but now with the vector field Aμ minimally coupled to a Dirac fermion. Thus, we have an extended QED model defined by the Lagrangian density

[formula]

where hμν  =  gμν  -  βbμbν and bμ is a constant background four-vector. Here, m and M are the masses of the gauge field Aμ and the electron, respectively, whereas ρ and β are dimensionless parameters introduced just to make explicit the contributions from distinct Lorentz-violating terms which appear in ([\ref=modelo]). The kinetic Lorentz-violating term, which we call aether term [\cite=Carroll], is a particular version of the more general CPT-even part of the gauge sector of the Standard Model Extension [\cite=kostelecky1] [\cite=kostelecky2], and can be radiatively induced [\cite=aether] when nonminimal couplings to fermions [\cite=nonminimal] are considered. On the other hand, the Lorentz-breaking mass term in the gauge sector can, for example, be generated by spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking in a Lorentz-violating gauge-Higgs model [\cite=lv-mass], emerging from the symmetric part of the second-rank background tensor which couples to the kinetic part of the Higgs field.

The gauge sector of this model was investigated in detail in [\cite=Fargnoli] and it was shown that it incorporates very interesting features. For example, it presents physical massive poles which, depending on the choice of the coefficients ρ and β, have its degrees of freedom changed. For this class of models, uncommon physical aspects can be accommodated for particular values of ρ and β, like, for example, the presence of propagating superluminal modes.

We now proceed to the dualization using the Noether dualization method. First, we carry out the variation of ([\ref=modelo]) related to an infinitesimal change δAμ in the gauge field:

[formula]

Of course, it is an off-shell method, since in the space of solutions we will have Jμ = 0. So the current Jμ in ([\ref=variat0]) can be used to construct a second Lagrangian density,

[formula]

where Bμ is an auxiliary vector field. If the auxiliary field is chosen such that δBμ  =  δAμ, the variation of ([\ref=L1]) will be given by

[formula]

in which δJμ  =  m2hμνδAν. With the variation ([\ref=deltaL1]), we can use the auxiliary field Bμ to construct a gauge invariant Lagrangian density. Actually, using a compensatory quadratic term in Bμ as

[formula]

we have [formula]. Finally, it is used the equation of motion for the field Bμ to obtain

[formula]

where we have defined the inverse of hμν as

[formula]

which should be used to write [formula] in terms of the field Aμ. So the resulting dual gauge invariant Lagrangian associated with the original model ([\ref=modelo]) reads

[formula]

in which we have inserted a gauge fixing term.

By construction, the NDM method gives rise to a gauge invariant Lagrangian, whereas the original model ([\ref=modelo]) does not have this symmetry. It is believed that the non-invariant model can be considered as the gauge fixed version of a gauge theory. Note that now the Dirac fermions are nonminimally coupled to the gauge field Aμ. Besides, the dual Lagrangian has a contribution of a four-fermion nonrenormalizable vertex, which is similar to the result obtained in the duality between the self-dual and Maxwell-Chern-Simons models coupled to fermions [\cite=Gomes:1997mf].

Electron-electron scattering

We now proceed to quantum perturbative calculations in order to check, at tree level, the physical equivalence of the models. We first observe the two photon propagators. From the quadratic terms in Aμ, the propagators for the gauge field in momentum-space for the original ([\ref=modelo]) and the dual ([\ref=duallagrang]) models are given, respectively, by

[formula]

and

[formula]

where the coefficients [formula] and [formula] are given by

[formula]

and

[formula]

The functions A1, A2, E, F and G in ([\ref=aCoeff]) and ([\ref=bCoeff]) are defined by

[formula]

As carefully studied in [\cite=Fargnoli], the propagator DμνD has, besides the physical poles of DμνO, new nonphysical ones. One way to proceed is to study the saturated propagator, which makes use of the current conservation to discard the nondynamical poles. Here, we intend to go further in a practical calculation of the electron-electron scattering.

Returning to the Feynman rules, in both cases the propagator of the matter field is the usual Dirac propagator.

Now we start to investigate the physical equivalence between the models, which is the main purpose of this letter. We are going to calculate the S-matrix contribution at order e2 in the electron-electron scattering.

Calculation with the original model

First, we consider the original model ([\ref=modelo]). Since the model has only the usual Dirac fermion minimally coupled to the gauge field Aμ, the two diagrams in figure [\ref=electron-3vertex] contribute at tree-level with the same vertex as ordinary QED. However, in this case, with the Aμ propagator given by expression ([\ref=PropagOrig]). The contribution to the S-matrix amplitude is given by [formula], where

[formula]

We have used p1 and p2 for external momentum of the free electrons in the initial states described by the spinors u(p1) and u(p2), and [formula] and [formula] for the free electrons in the final states [formula] and [formula]. The expression ([\ref=amplit1Orig]) can be obtained from the direct application of the LSZ reduction formula.

Since the fermions are on-shell, all terms from DμνO which are dependent on the external momentum can be neglected in the calculation of the amplitude. Thus, we stay with

[formula]

Calculation with the dual model

Interestingly, we can establish the perturbative equivalence between the original and the dual models at tree-level by comparing the expression ([\ref=amp_original]) with the similar expression obtained by using the Feynman rules from the Lagrangian ([\ref=duallagrang]). Besides the two diagrams in figure [\ref=electron-3vertex], in the dual model we must take into account the diagrams of figure [\ref=electron-4vertex]. For the calculation of the diagrams of figure [\ref=electron-3vertex], in this case, the Dirac matrix in ([\ref=amplit1Orig]) is given by

[formula]

and the propagator DμνO by the dual propagator in equation ([\ref=PropagDual]). It is interesting to note that the calculation is greatly simplified if it is used the following relation, satisfied by Γμ,

[formula]

By making these modifications in ([\ref=amplit1Orig]), using the relation ([\ref=relationGamma]) and the fact that fermions are on-shell, after a lengthy but straightforward algebra, we obtain

[formula]

in which

[formula]

and

[formula]

In addition, the contributions of the four-vertex diagrams of figure [\ref=electron-4vertex] read

[formula]

Finally, putting together contributions ([\ref=tau1]) and ([\ref=tau2]), we obtain the total tree-level amplitude for the dual theory:

[formula]

Comparing ([\ref=amplitDual]) and ([\ref=amp_original]), the physical equivalence of the models requires that

[formula]

In fact, using expressions ([\ref=Lexp]) and ([\ref=Qexp]) for Lμν and Qμν, respectively, and after a very lengthy algebra on the left-hand side of ([\ref=equivalencia]), the above relation is checked. So, τO  =  τD and the equivalence at this order is proved.

The cross section

To finish, we present the tree-level cross section for the electron-electron scattering at second order in the Lorentz-violating parameter bμ. To carry out this calculation, we have used the FeynCalc Mathematica package. The cross section is given by

[formula]

where τ  =  τO  =  τD and E is the energy in the center of mass. Using the approximations m / M <  < 1 and |b|2 <  < 1, we obtain the following expansion

[formula]

in which the dots represent higher order terms in the Lorentz-violating background vector bμ. The first term in ([\ref=secaochoque]) is just the well known result from ordinary QED. The second term is the contribution due to the Procca term, which reads

[formula]

where θ is the scattering angle between the direction of the incident and the outgoing particles. The last term of ([\ref=secaochoque]) is the correction introduced by the Lorentz violation. Just to illustrate, we explicitly show the expressions for timelike and spacelike bμ. For bμ spacelike, we take bμ = (t,0,0,0), such that the result reads

[formula]

For the spacelike case, we use bμ  =  (0,0,0,t) and the Lorentz-violating contribution reads

[formula]

To carry out these calculations we have chosen the spatial part of bμ in the same direction of the outgoing particle with momentum [formula]. Note that at second order in bμ only the aether term, [formula], contributes to the cross section, since only the parameter ρ appears in ([\ref=secaochoque]). The Lorentz-violating mass term in ([\ref=modelo]), which appears multiplied by the parameter β, will contribute only at higher orders.

Conclusion

We investigated the quantum equivalence of two dual Lorentz-breaking models. The procedure of dualization is known to produce knew nonphysical modes which, in some cases, may turn the model meaningless. A way out is to show that the new sector decouples from the physical part, and does not disturb the practical calculations. In some situations it is simple to prove that these modes have no dynamics by saturating the propagators with conserved currents. Here we opted to show how this mechanism works in a practical calculation of a physical process, more precisely the cross section of the electron-electron scattering.

We used the dual models studied in detail in [\cite=Fargnoli], in which a complicated structure of poles emerged for the dual gauge-invariant model. The equivalence of the models in this calculation was shown at tree-level through nontrivial cancelations. For this, an essential role was played by the new fermionic couplings which emerged in the dualization process. We expect that this equivalence is still valid in the nonperturbative approach, which is left for a future investigation.
