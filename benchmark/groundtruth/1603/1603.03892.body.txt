Introduction.

Historical background and some facts on the Mackey topology.

Locally convex topologies on linear spaces are a topic which has boosted a wide research in Functional Analysis. It was proved by G. Mackey [\cite=mack46] that the family of compatible locally convex topologies on a locally convex space has a top element. That is, for a (real or complex) locally convex space E with dual space E', there exists a locally convex topology μ  =  μ(E,E') with (E,μ)' = E', such that any other locally convex topology ν on E the dual of which is E', satisfies the inequality ν  ≤  μ. The topology μ satisfying these conditions is named the Mackey topology of E. The following result will be the inspiring source for our reflections on abelian topological groups.

[\cite=LTS] Metrizable locally convex linear topological spaces carry their Mackey topology.

A parallelism between real topological vector spaces and abelian topological groups can be established if the dualizing object in the framework of abelian topological groups is taken as the circle group [formula] (or equivalently the quotient group [formula]). The role of linear forms is played now by characters, and the dual group of a topological abelian group G is now [formula]. Another group topology on a topological group G will be called compatible if it gives rise to the same dual group [formula]. These basic concepts permit to study duality in the class of abelian topological groups.

The notion of quasi-convex subsets of a topological abelian group (Vilenkin, [\cite=Vil]) paved the way to formulate the questions underlying the Mackey theory from topological vector spaces to the class of abelian groups. A decade after the introduction of locally quasi-convex groups, Varopoulos tried to extend the Mackey theory to abelian groups, seemingly unaware of the work of Vilenkin. For this goal he focused on locally precompact groups, a subclass of the class of locally quasi-convex groups. He proved that a metrizable locally precompact topological abelian group carries the finest compatible locally precompact group topology [\cite=V]. That is, a metrizable locally precompact group is Mackey in the class of locally precompact groups (or Lpc-Mackey, in terms of Definition [\ref=Def-G-Mackey]).

In 1999 in [\cite=CMPT] a framework was established to generalize the Mackey theory for locally convex spaces to the larger class of locally quasi-convex groups. Although a topological vector space is locally convex if and only if it is locally quasi-convex as a topological group [\cite=B], there are some obstructions to extend the Mackey-Arens theorem to the class of locally quasi-convex groups, so the Mackey problem is stated as follows in [\cite=CMPT]:

Let (G,τ) be a locally quasi-convex topological group. Let C(G,τ) denote the family of all locally quasi-convex group topologies which are compatible with τ.

Does there exist a top element in the family C(G,τ)?

If it exists, we denote it by μ  =  μ(G,τ). Then (G,μ) will be called a Mackey group and μ the Mackey topology for (G,τ).

In the class Lqc there always exists a bottom element in C(G,τ), namely the weak topology on G induced by [formula]. So in case a precompact topology is Mackey (cf. Theorem B (ii)), then it is the unique compatible topology.

This problem is a specialization of a more general one. In order to formulate it we need the following:

Let G be a class of abelian topological groups and let (G,τ) be a topological group in G. Let [formula] denote the family of all G-topologies ν on G compatible with τ. We say that [formula] is the G-Mackey topology for [formula] (or the Mackey topology for (G,τ) in G) if ν  ≤  μ for all [formula]. If G is the class of locally quasi-convex groups Lqc, we will simply say that the topology is Mackey.

The Mackey topology exists in G if and only if the supremum of two compatible topologies in G is again compatible.

Let G be a class of topological abelian groups. Does there exist a top element in the family [formula], i.e., does the G-Mackey topology exist ?

The problem whether the Mackey topology exists, in the setting of Lqc-groups, is so far open. Under some constrains on the starting topological group it does. For instance, in the following classes of topological groups, the Mackey topology exists and it is precisely the original one:

[\cite=CMPT] Let (G,τ) be a locally quasi-convex topological group satisfying one of the following conditions:

G is Baire and separable.

G is ech-complete (in particular, if G is metrizable and complete).

G is pseudocompact.

Then τ is the Mackey topology for (G,τ).

The fact that every metrizable and complete locally quasi-convex group is Mackey, points out an analogy between topological groups and linear topological spaces where the counterpart of this result is available (see Theorem [\ref=MackeyThm]).

There are metrizable locally quasi-convex groups which are not Mackey. Thus completeness seems to be an essential requirement.

The following groups admit a metrizable non-discrete locally quasi-convex topology which is not Mackey. Since they are countable they cannot be complete, for otherwise, by the Baire Category Theorem they would be discrete:

The group of the integers [formula] endowed with any non-discrete linear topology is metrizable and locally quasi-convex but fails to be Mackey ([\cite=AD]).

The Prüfer groups [formula] endowed with the topology inherited from [formula] are metrizable locally-quasi-convex groups which are not Mackey ([\cite=DlB]).

The group of rationals [formula] endowed with the topology inherited from the real line is a non precompact metrizable locally quasi-convex group which is not Mackey ([\cite=DlB] [\cite=DE]).

The following groups are metrizable locally quasi-convex and Mackey:

Let m  ≥  2 be a natural number and consider the direct sum of countable many copies of [formula], [formula] endowed with the topology inherited from the product [formula]. Then Gm is a metrizable, locally quasi-convex non-complete Mackey group ([\cite=BTM]).

One can also find examples with a stronger flavor from Functional Analysis, namely connected, metrizable topological groups which are not Mackey. Indeed, the group of all the null-sequences on [formula], endowed with the topology inherited from the product [formula] is a metrizable connected precompact locally quasi-convex group topology which is not Mackey ([\cite=DMPT]).

Main results.

Metrizability alone does not ensure that a locally quasi-convex topology on a group is Mackey, unless it is accompanied (or replaced) by an additional topological property (completeness, etc., see Theorem [\ref=TheoremCMPT]). This motivates to investigate which additional properties of algebraic nature, that when imposed along with metrizability guarantees that a locally quasi-convex topology group is Mackey.

We say that an abelian group G satisfies the Varopoulos Paradigm, if every metrizable locally quasi-convex topology on G must be a Mackey topology. We briefly denote this by [formula].

According to the main theorem of this paper, the groups satisfying the Varopoulos Paradigm are exactly the bounded ones:

Theorem A:

For the proof of Theorem A, we will consider separately the cases of bounded and unbounded groups. In each case we will get one of the implications of Theorem A. In fact, Theorem B is a stronger version of the implication (ii)  ⇒  (i) in Theorem A, while Theorem C is simply the implication (i)  ⇒  (ii).

The main result in the case of bounded groups is:

Theorem B:

In [\cite=BTM] a weaker version of Theorem B (ii) was shown, namely: Every bounded precompact topological group (G,τ) with [formula] is Mackey.

In [\cite=LL] Theorem B (ii) was proved by other methods.

Immediately from Theorem B (ii) we get:

Let (G,τ) be a locally quasi-convex group topology on a bounded group which is not precompact. Then [formula].

The following examples shall show that none of the hypotheses of Theorem B can be omitted:

The p-adic topology on [formula] is locally quasi-convex (even linear), metrizable, and precompact, but it is not Mackey ([\cite=AD]). Its dual group has cardinality [formula].

Consider a D-sequence [formula] satisfying [formula] as in [\cite=AD]. Let [formula] be the topology on [formula] of uniform convergence on the set [formula]. As proved in [\cite=AD], [formula] is metrizable and locally quasi-convex and satisfies [formula] but it is not precompact.

The Pr�fer group [formula] endowed with the topology from [formula] is a prcompact, metrizable torsion group with countable dual group which is not Mackey according to [\cite=DlB]. This shows that we cannot replace "bounded" by "torsion groups".

The direct sum of [formula]-many copies of [formula] endowed with the topology inherited from the product [formula] is precompact (and linear) and bounded, but its dual group has cardinality [formula]. This shows that the first implication of Theorem B (ii) cannot be inverted.

The group [formula] endowed with the discrete topology is bounded, locally quasi-convex with [formula], but it is not precompact.

Let G be an infinite (bounded) group. Let δ+ denote the Bohr topology on G, i.e. the weak topology on G induced by all homomorphisms [formula]. Then (G,δ+) is (bounded,) precompact, [formula] and it is not Mackey, as the discrete topology is Mackey topology for [formula].

From Theorem B (and some extra results from [\cite=ADM1]), we compute the cardinality of the family C(G,τ) for a metrizable bounded group, as expressed next:

Corollary B1: Let (G,τ) be a metrizable, locally quasi-convex and bounded group. Then:

[formula] if and only if τ is precompact. In this case, (G,τ) is precompact and Mackey.

Otherwise [formula]. In this case, τ is the only metrizable topology in C(G,τ).

Corollary B1 solves Conjecture 7.6 in [\cite=ADM1] for bounded groups.

Let G be a countable group. Under Martin Axiom, there exist [formula] precompact topologies of weight [formula] on G. Indeed, there exist [formula] precompact -pairwise different- topologies on G. We compute the cardinality of precompact topologies with weight [formula]. Consider a cardinal [formula]. Since every precompact topology of weight κ is determined exactly by a subgroup of G* of cardinality κ, there exist [formula] precompact topologies of weight κ. Now, [formula], hence [formula] . Consequently, there exist [formula] precompact topologies of weight [formula] on G.

The following question arises:

Let G be a countable group. How many of the precompact topologies of weight [formula] on G are Mackey? How many of them fail to be Mackey?

Although we don't know the answer to this question, we give the following partial answer:

Corollary B 2: Let G be a bounded countably infinite group. Then, there exist [formula] precompact topologies of weight [formula] which are not Mackey.

Since G is bounded and countably infinite, there exists a natural number L such that [formula], where mn < L for all [formula]. Hence, we can write G = G1  ×  G2 where both G1 and G2 are infinite. Since G1 is infinite, there exists a family of [formula] precompact topologies {τi} on G1 whose weight is [formula]. Consider the discrete topology d in G2 and in G the product topology, namely Ti  =  τi  ×  d. The topology Ti is metrizable (hence, by Theorem B, Mackey) but not precompact (for each i). In addition, [formula]. Hence the topologies T+i are precompact of weight [formula] and not Mackey.

Does there exist a precompact bounded group of weight [formula] which is Mackey?

In § [\ref=sectionBounded], we prove Theorem B and Corollary B1.

We shall show in another paper that in the class of linearly topologized groups the Mackey topology exists and that every metrizable linear topology is the Mackey topology in this class.

For unbounded groups, the picture is completely different. In fact, on any unbounded topological group we can build a metrizable locally quasi-convex group topology which is not Mackey. This is Theorem C, which is the main result in this direction:

Theorem C:

The proof of Theorem C, given in § 3, is based in the following facts:

[formula] and [formula] have a metrizable locally quasi-convex non-Mackey topology (see Example [\ref=exampleUnboundedDadidi]).

Every unbounded group G has a subgroup of the form [formula] or [formula], where p is a prime and (mn) is a sequence with lim mn  =    ∞   [\cite=Fuc].

Open subgroups of Mackey groups are Mackey (Lemma [\ref=theorem11Dadidi]).

For any sequence (mn) with mn  →    ∞   the product topology of the group [formula] is metrizable and non-Mackey (Proposition [\ref=theorem12Dadidi]), witnessing [formula].

As a by-product, the construction in Proposition [\ref=theorem12Dadidi] (of a compatible locally quasi-convex topology finer than the product topology) can be used to provide [formula] many pairwise non-isomorphic metrizable locally precompact linear group topologies on the group [formula] and all its subgroups of infinite rank (compare with Example [\ref=exampleUnboundedDadidi](c), where the single topology with similar properties is not linear).

Notation and terminology.

The symbols [formula] will stand for the natural numbers, the integer numbers, the rational numbers, the complex numbers, the Prüfer groups and the unit circle of the complex plane respectively. Using the structure of [formula], in particular, the real part function Re(z) for [formula], we let [formula] (although we frequently identify [formula] with the quotient group [formula], if the additive notation is more convenient). The group [formula] denotes the cyclic group of m elements. For an abelian group G, we denote by Gd the group endowed with its discrete topology and [formula]. For a cardinal κ we denote by G(κ) the direct sum [formula] of κ copies of G.

For a topological group (G,τ) its dual group is the group of continuous homomorphisms [formula], and will be denoted by [formula] or [formula] if the topology is clear. For an abelian group G, we say that τ and ν are compatible if [formula]. For a topological group (G,τ), we denote by C(G,τ) the family of all locally quasi-convex topologies on G which are compatible with τ. A subgroup H  ≤  G of a topological group is dually closed if for any x∉H, there exists [formula] satisfying that φ(H) = 0 and φ(x)  ≠  0.

For an abelian group G and a subgroup [formula] we shall denote by σ(G,H) the weak topology on G induced by the elements of H. When the initial group is a topological group, then [formula] is a subgroup and we write τ+ instead of [formula]. The topology τ+ is usually called the Bohr topology of (G,τ). Obviously, H is dually closed if it is τ+-closed. If G carries the discrete topology, the corresponding Bohr topology has remarkable properties (see for example [\cite=VD1990]).

A group G is said to be bounded if there exists [formula] satisfying that mG = 0. In this case, we will call the exponent of G to the minimum positive integer satisfying this condition. For a prime number p, we say that a group G is a p-group if for every x∈G there exists a natural number n satisfying that pnx = 0.

Let (G,τ) be a topological group. We say that τ is linear if it has a neighborhood basis consisting in subgroups. In this case, we say that (G,τ) is linearly topologized.

Let (G,τ) be a topological group. We say that a subset M  ⊂  G is quasi-convex if for every [formula], there exists [formula] satisfying that [formula] and [formula]. If τ has a neighborhood basis consisting in quasi-convex sets, we say that τ is locally quasi-convex.

Further, we set for a subset [formula] and for a subset [formula].

For the reader's convenience, we include a proof of the following result, which can be found also in [\cite=AG].

Let (G,τ) be a locally quasi-convex bounded group. Then τ is linear.

Suppose that mG = 0. Let U be a quasi-convex neighborhood of 0 in G. It is well known that [formula] is an equicontinuous subset of [formula]. Hence there exists a neighborhood W of 0 in G such that [formula](m)isnon - decreasing,sincearearrangementofthesequence(m)leadstoanisomorphicgroup.Forx=(x,x,)∈ Gandχ=(χ,χ,)∈ G,wehaveχ(x)=χ x+ Z.Forn∈,let(e)=(0,,0,1,0,)∈ G,with1inn- thpositionanddefine={± e:n∈}{0}⊂ G.Identifying Twith(-,],welet T= {x∈: | x |≤}[formula]{V:m∈}isaneighborhoodbasisof0forthetopologyτofuniformconvergenceon.Writingtheelementsx=(x)ofG,withx=(asin()),onehasV={x∈ G:| k |≤ for all n}[formula](G,τ)=.Thefact≤ (G,τ)isstraightforward.Indeed,letχ∈.Thenthereexistsn∈suchthatχ=0ifn≥ n.Letm=m,hencex==x=0forallx∈ V.Thenχ(V)={0}.Letχ=(χ)∈.ThenthesetA:={n∈:χ≠ 0}isinfinite.Ouraimistoprovethatχ∈(G,τ).Wearguebycontradiction,assumingthatχ∈(G,τ).Thenχ∈ V:={φ∈ (G,τ):φ(V)⊂}forsomem∈.Hence,wemustfindx∈ Vwithχ(x)∉[formula] ≤ifn≥ n.Wedescribenextin(a)someelementsofV,whichwillbesuitableforourpurposesandin(b)aconditionforthecomponentsofχ[formula]x=0forn<nandx∈{0,±}foralln≥ n,thenx=(x)∈ V[formula] ≤ for all n≤ n.(a)Indeed,since ≤≤ifn≥ n,itfollowsfrom()thatx∈ V.(b)Byitem(a),wehavethatx=(0,,,)∈ V.Sinceχ∈ V,itfollowsthat | χ(x) |=≤.

To continue the proof of Lemma [\ref=lemma12.1Dadidi], define, for each [formula], the set

[formula]

Then [formula] is a finite partition of A and at least one Ak is infinite, as A is infinite. In order to define an element x∈Vm which satisfies [formula] we distinguish the cases k  ≥  1 and k = 0.

Case 1: [formula] Since Ak is infinite, one can find [formula] in Ak. Define

[formula]

By the definition of Ak, we have [formula] for [formula]. Thus,

[formula]

Taking into account that each summand in the above sum satisfies [formula] by Claim [\ref=LastClaim](b), we conclude that there exists a natural N  ≤  mn0 such that

[formula]

Define

[formula]

By Claim [\ref=LastClaim](a), x' = (x'n)∈Vm and by construction [formula].

Case 2: [formula]

That is: A0 is infinite. Choose J  ⊂  A0 with [formula]. For n∈J, define

[formula]

First, note that for all n∈J one has jn  ≠  0, as [formula], where the last inequality is due to ([\ref=n03Abril]). On the other hand,

[formula]

This gives [formula], as [formula]. Define

[formula]

Then, x  =  (xn)∈Vm, by equation ([\ref=(99)]).

In addition,

[formula]

Combining ([\ref=Estimacion13Abril]) and ([\ref=Estimacion23Abril]), we get, for n∈J:

[formula]

Applying these inequalities to [formula] gives

[formula]

This implies that [formula], a contradiction in view of x∈Vm.

In both cases this proves that [formula].

Hence [formula].

Proof of Theorem C: We have to prove that for any unbounded abelian group G, there exists a metrizable locally quasi-convex group topology which is not Mackey. We divide the proof in three cases, namely:

G is non reduced.

G is non torsion.

G is reduced and torsion.

(a) If G is non reduced, write d(G) its maximal divisible subgroup. Then [formula] [\cite=Fuc].

If α  ≠  0, then we there exists H  ≤  G, where [formula]. Since, there exists a metrizable non-Mackey topology on [formula] ([\cite=DlB]), applying Lemma [\ref=lemma11.1Dadidi], G is not Mackey as well.

If α = 0, then there exists pi satisfying [formula]. Since there exists a metrizable, non-Mackey topology on [formula] ([\cite=DlB]), there exists (by Lemma [\ref=lemma11.1Dadidi]) a metrizable topology on G which is not Mackey.

(b) If G is non torsion, there exists x∈G, such that [formula]. Equip [formula] with the [formula]-adic topology, which is metrizable but not Mackey ([\cite=AD]). Applying Lemma [\ref=lemma11.1Dadidi], we get the result.

(c) We can write G as the direct sum of its primary components, that is [formula]. Consider two cases:

(c.1) Gp  ≠  0 for infinitely many prime numbers p. Then, for some infinite set Π of prime numbers,we have [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=theorem12Dadidi], there exists a metrizable locally quasi-convex group topology on [formula] which is not Mackey. Hence, by Lemma [\ref=lemma11.1Dadidi], there exists a metrizable locally quasi-convex group topology which is not Mackey on G.

(c.2) Gp  ≠  0 for finitely many p. Then, one of them is unbounded, say Gp. Let [formula] be a basic subgroup of Gp, i.e., B is pure and Gp / B is divisible [\cite=Fuc]. Let us recall the fact that purity of B means that [formula] for every [formula].

We aim to prove that B is unbounded. Assume for contradiction that B is bounded, so pnB = 0 for some [formula]. Then [formula]. One has [formula]; the last congruence holds, since B is pure in Gp and the last equality is a consequence of the divisibility of Gp / B. This means that pnGp + B = Gp. Since [formula], this is equivalent to [formula]. Then [formula] is a divisible subgroup of the reduced group Gp. Hence [formula] and Gp  =  B is bounded, a contradiction.

Since B is unbounded there exists a sequence [formula] with αni  ≠  0 such that [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=theorem12Dadidi], there exists a metrizable locally quasi-convex group topology on [formula] which is not Mackey. Hence, by Lemma [\ref=lemma11.1Dadidi], there exists a metrizable locally quasi-convex group topology which is not Mackey on G.

Now we can prove the main theorem.

Proof of Theorem A: We have to prove that for an abelian group G the following assertions are equivalent:

Every metrizable locally quasi-convex group topology on G is Mackey.

G is bounded.

(i) implies (ii) is Theorem C. (ii) implies (i) is Theorem B.
