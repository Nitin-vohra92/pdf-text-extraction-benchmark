Prefactor in the dynamically assisted Sauter-Schwinger effect

Introduction

In [\cite=Linder2015] the impact of different pulse shapes on the dynamically assisted Sauter-Schwinger mechanism has been compared. The Sauter-Schwinger effect is a striking phenomenon predicted by Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), that describes non-perturbative pair creation from the QED vacuum by a strong electromagnetic field [\cite=Sauter1931] [\cite=Sauter1932] [\cite=Heisenberg1936] [\cite=Schwinger1951]. So far, experimental verification has not been possible, due to the extremely high critical field strength [formula] where pair production is expected for a uniform, static electric field.

An extension that can significantly lower this threshold is dynamical assistance [\cite=Schutzhold2008], where an additional weak, time dependent field with [formula] is superimposed onto a static field.

In the following, we will apply the worldline instanton method [\cite=Feynman1950] [\cite=Affleck1982] [\cite=Schubert2001] [\cite=Kim2002] [\cite=Dunne2005] [\cite=Dunne2006a] [\cite=Schubert2012] to calculate the full pair production rate (i.e. the exponent and the prefactor) in the dynamically assisted Sauter-Schwinger effect for different shapes of time dependent pulses. Section [\ref=sec:method] will give a summary of the method, which is then used in section [\ref=sec:application] to yield both numerical results without any further approximations and analytical estimates in certain parameter regions.

Worldline instanton method

Let us first briefly review the worldline instanton method. For a detailed derivation see, e.g. [\cite=Dunne2005] [\cite=Dunne2006a]. We start out with the vacuum persistence amplitude, which can be expressed using the effective action [formula],

[formula]

We use the subscript [formula] to indicate Minkowskian quantities, in contrast to the Euclidean versions we will mostly be concerned with in the following.

If the effective action were to gain an imaginary part, the absolute value of the vacuum persistence would deviate from one, which can be interpreted as the probability amplitude for pair production:

[formula]

After analytic continuation, the Euclidean effective action can be expressed using the worldline path integral

[formula]

The worldline instanton approach is a semiclassical approximation to [\eqref=eq:fullpathintegral], by evaluating both the path integral and the integral over T using the saddle point method.

For the path integral, we need to find a path x(τ) with x(T) = x(0) that extremizes

[formula]

for a given T. The Euler-Lagrange equations for this action functional give the equations of motion

[formula]

A solution to [\eqref=eq:instantoneqs] that satisfies the periodicity conditions is called a world line instanton, in analogy to the instantons in nonrelativistic quantum tunneling [\cite=Coleman1985].

The saddle point approximation includes an additional prefactor, arising from the fluctuations around the extremum. For the path integral, this amounts to the determinant of a second order differential operator [\cite=kleinert2009]. Remarkably, this determinant can be found using a finite determinant comprised of solutions to a certain initial value problem (for a derivation using methods of complex analysis, see [\cite=Kirsten2003]).

Including the fluctuation prefactor, the saddle point approximation of the path integral in [\eqref=eq:fullpathintegral] is given by

[formula]

The ημ are solutions to the fluctuation equations of motion and θ is the Morse index [\cite=morse1934] of the fluctuation operator (omitted here for brevity).

Let us now restrict ourselves to time dependent, homogeneous electric fields of constant direction. In particular, we use the Euclidean four-potential

[formula]

leading to the electric field

[formula]

In this case, both the instanton action and the fluctuation determinant can be found, up to quadrature, in terms of the function f.

The remaining T-integral can be done explicitly using the saddle point approximation as well. The imaginary part of the Minkowski effective action is then completely determined by the single function

[formula]

where γ = mω / qE is the Keldysh parameter and χ* is determined by the implicit equation

[formula]

Using this function, we find our final expression for the imaginary part of the effective action, and thus the pair production rate:

[formula]

with the function

[formula]

The three-volume V3 is given by the spatial extent of the electric field, for example the focal spot of a laser beam.

Dynamically assisted Sauter-Schwinger effect

We now apply [\eqref=eq:gDefinition], [\eqref=eq:effectiveAction] and [\eqref=eq:invpfDefinition] to the dynamically assisted Sauter-Schwinger effect.

As in [\cite=Linder2015], we choose the function

[formula]

representing the sum of a strong, slow field (in this case approximated by a static background) and a weak, faster profile with [formula],

[formula]

Note that in this case, the combined Keldysh parameter γ = mω / qE depends on the frequency ω of the weak pulse, but on the field strength E of the slow, strong field.

In the remainder of this section, we will choose the following profiles for the time dependent pulses:

Cosine cos (ωt), [formula]

Gaussian exp ( - ω2t2), [formula]

Sauter cosh - 2(ωt), [formula]

Lorentzian (1 + ω2t2)- 1, [formula]

First, we will numerically calculate g(γ) and Φ(γ) (and thus [formula]) for these pulse shapes h(χ). In section [\ref=sec:analytical] we will then present analytical approximations for the pair production rate.

Numerical evaluation

The effective action [\eqref=eq:effectiveAction] can be evaluated straightforwardly using numerical methods. The only challenge is solving the implicit equation [\eqref=eq:chiImplicit], which, for our choice of f [\eqref=eq:assistedF] has the form For the cosine and Gaussian profiles, h is smooth and a simple root finding algorithm converges using basically any choice of starting point. For the other two profiles however, h diverges (at χ  =  π / 2 or χ = 1 respectively), so for small ε, the starting points for the root finding method have to be chosen with some care.

As soon as χ* is found, a standard numerical integration routine can be used to evaluate [\eqref=eq:gDefinition] and [\eqref=eq:invpfDefinition], yielding the effective Action [\eqref=eq:effectiveAction].

For the spatial volume, we choose a focal region of [formula] and sum the pair production for each of the fast pulses while the strong field is active (an additional factor of [formula]). The strong field has an intensity of , corresponding to [formula].

Figure [\ref=fig:actionContour] shows the results of this procedure. In all cases there is a region of relatively weak dependence on the frequency of the weak field and a region of strong enhancement, as soon as the Keldysh parameter crosses a threshold value [formula]. For the cosine and Gauss profiles, this threshold depends on ε, while it is approximately constant for the Sauter and Lorentz pulses. This is the same behavior as seen in [\cite=Linder2015] considering the exponent only, we can now conclude that the prefactor does not change this qualitatively.

Analytical approximations

To find analytical expressions for g(γ) and thus Φ(γ) and [formula], we can use different approaches for [formula] and [formula].

Below threshold, we can Taylor-expand g(γ) to first order in ε

[formula]

Note that this approximation works only for subcritical γ, because otherwise h(γχ) grows large, invalidating the expansion.

Substituting this expression for g(γ) in [\eqref=eq:invpfDefinition] we get

[formula]

Now all that is left is to calculate G(γ) for the different pulse profiles:

For the Sauter profile, it is unfortunately not possible to find a closed form expression for the integral in G(γ), so we can not give an analytic expression for its subcritical behavior.

For [formula] however, the function g(γ) can be approximated in the limit [formula] for the Sauter and Lorentzian pulses by geometric considerations [\cite=Schutzhold2008], leading to

[formula]

and substituting [formula] (due to the different pole position for the Lorentzian pulse)

[formula]

Figure [\ref=fig:lorentzAna] shows the numerical calculation of [formula] for different values of ε, the approximations [\eqref=eq:lorentzG] and [\eqref=eq:lorentzInvpf] for γ < 1 and [\eqref=eq:lorentzgAbove] for γ > 1. Far above threshold, the pair production rate converges to the approximation [\eqref=eq:lorentzgAbove], independent of ε. Closer to the threshold, the geometric approach breaks down for larger values of ε, although for ε = 10- 2 the numerical values agree with the approximation very well. As expected, the approximation [\eqref=eq:lorentzG] below threshold works better, the smaller the expansion parameter ε gets.

Summary and conclusion

Using the worldline instanton method, we have been able to numerically calculate and find analytical approximations for the pair production rate in the dynamically assisted Sauter-Schwinger effect. Building on [\cite=Linder2015], this now includes the quantum mechanical fluctuation prefactor, which is shown not to counteract the mechanism of dynamical assistance.

Comparing the different pulse shapes considered, they all exhibit the same qualitative behavior. This includes a region of negligible dependence on the time dependent field up to a threshold value of the Keldysh parameter γ, beyond which the pair production rate is exponentially enhanced.

This threshold [formula] is independent of ε for the Sauter and Lorentzian pulses, in contrast to the sinusoidally varying field and Gaussian pulse which is caused by the different analytic structure of the field profiles.
