Spin and quadrupolar orders in the spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic model for iron-based superconductors

[formula]

Introduction

The parent compounds of the recently discovered iron-based superconductors (SCs) exhibit a variety of unusual magnetic phases, reviewed by Ref. [\cite=RevModPhys.87.855] and references therein. Instead of the regular Néel antiferromagnetic (AFM) order found in cuprates, iron pnictides display an collinear antiferromagnetic (CAFM) order. In contrast to cuprates superconductors where the magnetism of the parent compounds are well described by a nearest-neighbor (NN) Heisenberg model, the character of magnetic interactions in iron-based SCs may not be well described by Heisenberg-type models.

Early inelastic neutron scattering (INS) experiments in the iron pnictides show that the spin-wave excitations in these compounds are highly anisotropic [\cite=NatPhys.5.555] [\cite=PhysRevB.83.214519] [\cite=PhysRevB.84.054544], with a dispersion which can be understood in terms of an anisotropic Jx - Jy - J2 model with antiferromagnetic Jx and ferromagnetic Jy, which are impossible to reconcile even when the small orthorhombic lattice distortion is taken into account. Instead, this puzzling feature can be naturally explained with the inclusion of a biquadratic interaction. Indeed, the parent compounds of a large majority of iron-based SCs host a range of semimetallic behaviors, signaling the deviation of Mott insulating state, it is natural that the magnetic Hamiltonian consists of not only bilinear spin interactions originating from the strong coupling regime but also interactions involving multi-spin exchange terms when perturbation expansion is carried out up to fourth order [\cite=Fazekas1999] [\cite=EurPhysJB]. Note that the strong anisotropy of magnetic interactions in iron-based SCs was also argued to be linked with nematic ordering [\cite=NatPhys.10.97] while whether the spin-nematic scenario [\cite=PhysRevB.77.224509] [\cite=PhysRevB.78.020501] [\cite=Dai17032009] [\cite=PhysRevLett.107.217002] or orbital ordering [\cite=PhysRevB.79.054504] [\cite=PhysRevB.80.224506] [\cite=PhysRevLett.103.267001] [\cite=PhysRevB.80.180418] [\cite=PhysRevB.82.045125] plays the role is still under debate.

In the previous studies of the CAFM iron pnictides, only the NN biquadratic coupling K1 was included which leads to a minimum effective J1 - J2 - K model  [\cite=NatPhys.7.485] [\cite=PhysRevB.84.064505] [\cite=PhysRevB.85.144403] [\cite=PhysRevB.86.085148] [\cite=PhysRevB.92.165102]. The model can really preserve the tetragonal lattice symmetry and capture the essentially anisotropic spin excitations of the parent compounds CaFe2As2 and BaFe2As2. However, it is not a prior that the next NN biquadratic coupling K2 is negligible since the NN and next NN (NNN) bilinear exchanges J1 and J2 are comparable by inferring from the INS experiments, indicating that the superexchange processes through NNN sites are substantial. In this paper, we consider the extended bilinear-biquadratic (BBQ) model defined as

[formula]

where 〈ij〉1 and 〈ij〉2 denote the NN and NNN bonds, respectively. We note that we have not considered the third NN couplings which are believed to be essential to describe the magnetic properties of iron chalcogenides [\cite=PhysRevB.85.144403] [\cite=PhysRevLett.115.116401], since the above model appears to be adequate to describe iron pnictides.

In the present work, we assume the effective spin S = 1 on the iron sites based on the successful studies of two-band models [\cite=PhysRevB.77.220503]. The reason is two-fold, (i) [formula] agrees with the observed relative small local moments from the integrated spin spectral weight of INS measurements, (ii) the biquadratic spin interactions are expected to be a natural consequence of the strong coupling expansion in multi-orbital systems with local effective spin [formula] induced by Hund's coupling. The later can be easily understood by recasting the biquadratic term as

[formula]

where [formula] is the quadrupolar operator with five components [formula] [\cite=Penc2010]. It is worth noting that [formula] for [formula] and the BBQ model ([\ref=BBQmodel]) reduces to an effective   -   model with renormalized exchange constants [formula] and [formula]. Since it is commonly believed that a J1 - J2 model can not explain the observed anisotropic spin excitations in iron pnictides, this justifies the validity of using S = 1 for our study.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec. [\ref=Sec.ground_state], we respectively identify various variational ground states and a portion of the mean-field phase diagram for the present model. In Sec. [\ref=Sec.flavor_wave], we introduce the SU(3) flavor-wave theory for spin-1 systems and discuss its implications for the spin dynamics of CAFM iron pnictides. The comparison with the results given by conventional SU(2) spin-wave theory is also made. In Sec. [\ref=Sec.dynamic_correlations] we present the dynamic correlation functions of both spin dipolar and quadrupolar components with connections to the future experiments in iron pnictides. Sec. [\ref=Sec.conclusion] is devoted to our summary and conclusion. For the sake of completeness, we present the formula of the conventional SU(2) spin-wave theory in the Appendix.

Variational ground states

Parametrization of spin-1 states

We discuss the zero temperature variational phase diagram based on the following site-factorized wave function [\cite=PhysRevLett.97.087205] [\cite=TsunetsuguJPSJ75083701]

[formula]

where N is the number of lattice sites and [formula] the local wave function. It is convenient to introduce the time-reversal invariant basis for spin-1 states

[formula]

where [formula] are the usual basis quantized along the z axis. A general single-site wave function can be written as

[formula]

where [formula] satisfies the normalization constraint [formula]. Without loss of generality, one can choose [formula] and [formula] in such a way that [formula]. The coherent spin state is realized for u = v and [formula]. If u = 0 or v = 0, the state is purely quadrupolar with a director along the nonzero component [formula] or [formula]. In fact, one may refer to the larger of the two vectors as the director in the case [formula] (in other words, the spin is not fully developed). It is evident that the director has to lie in the plane perpendicular to the spin vector in the partially developed state.

Large-J ground state

Using Eq. ([\ref=BQterm]), we can recast the BBQ Hamiltonian ([\ref=BBQmodel]) as, up to a constant energy ([formula]

[formula]

where we have defined the effective spin dipolar and quadrupolar couplings [formula] and [formula], respectively. In order to provide a simple but rather instructive picture, the minimization of the mean-field ground state energy [formula] can be carried out first for several limiting cases with only one type of coupling surviving, which we call large-J limit. Since the exchange couplings involve both NN and NNN bonds, one obtains eight different ground state manifolds depending on the sign of the coupling coefficient. Some of these ground state manifolds are unique while others are degenerate. The variational results are summarized in Table [\ref=Table:Groundstate]. We will now present the detailed analysis for each case in the following.

(i) Large-JD1 limit. We may set |JD1| = 1 and JQ1 = JD2 = JQ2 = 0. In this case we find only spin dipolar operators among NN bonds are coupled. The presence of only JD1 interaction induces conventional ferromagnetic (FM) phase for JD1 < 0 and Néel AFM phase for JD1 > 0.

(ii) Large-JQ1 limit. We may set |JQ1| = 1 and JD1 = JD2 = JQ2 = 0. In this case we find only spin quadrupolar operators among NN bonds are coupled. It is easy to show that a ferroquadrupolar (FQ) phase with parallel directors for all the sites will be stabilized for JQ1 > 0. However, the case for antiferroquadrupolar (AFQ) coupling JQ1 < 0 is nontrivial. In order to gain further insight, one should note that the expectation value of a pair of quadrupolar operators can be written as

[formula]

We see that [formula] is minimized if [formula] is orthogonal both to [formula] and its time-reversal transform, which implies that one state is a pure quadrupole with director [formula] while another one may feature either a pure quadrupole with its director prependicular to [formula], or a spin vector of arbitrary length pointing along [formula]. Following Ref. [\cite=Papanicolaou1988367] [\cite=PhysRevLett.105.265301] [\cite=PhysRevB.85.140403], we call this phase "semi-ordered" (SO). The degeneracy of a SO bond with dominant AFQ coupling among two sites is depicted in Fig. [\ref=fig:SObond].

(iii) Large-JD2 limit. We may set |JD2| = 1 and JD1 = JQ1 = JQ2 = 0. In this case we find only spin dipolar operators among NNN bonds are coupled. In the presence of only JD2 interaction, the lattice decouples into two interpenetrating FM (JD2 < 0) or AFM (JD2 < 0) sublattices and the angle between the magnetization or staggered magnetization of these two sublattices is arbitrary. The decoupled AFM and FM phases on a plaquette are depicted in Fig. [\ref=fig:Decoupled] (a) and (b), respectively.

(iv) Large-JQ2 limit. We may set |JQ2| = 1 and JD1 = JQ1 = JD2 = 0. In this case, we find only spin quadrupolar operators among NNN bonds are coupled. In analogy with the above analysis, we also find two decoupled phases with decoupled FQ for JQ2 > 0 and deoupled SO for JQ2 < 0. We depicted two examples on a plaquette in Fig. [\ref=fig:Decoupled] (c) and (d).

Lift of degeneracy via various perturbations

Based on the large-J analysis, we find that the SO phase and the four decoupled phase are infinitely degenerate. The presence of infinite degeneracies comes from two aspects. One is from the arbitrary spin moment in a SO bond. Another is from the continuous rotation between the two decoupled lattices. We will show that the massive degeneracy in the large-J phases can be fully or partially lifted due to the perturbation of various secondary interactions. The results are summarized in Table [\ref=Table:lift]. We present the detailed analysis for each degenerate large-J phase in the following.

(i) Lift of degeneracy in the SO phase. Since the expectation value of a pair of spin operators can be written as

[formula]

We see that [formula] is always zero when one of the two sites features a purely quadrupolar state. Thus including the NN dipolar coupling JD1 has no consequence on the ground state energy of SO phase.

However, we find that the degeneracy of the SO phase will be fully lifted in the presence of finite JD2 coupling , leading to two interpenetrating sublattices along the diagonal direction with one sublattice featuring FQ order and the other featuring AFM (JD2 > 0) or FM (JD2 < 0) order, see Fig. [\ref=fig:SOlift] (a) and (b) for an illustration on a plaquette. We call this phase diagonal FQ+FM for JD2 < 0 and diagonal FQ+AFM for JD2 > 0.

Likewise, the presence of finite JQ2 coupling will also lift the degeneracy of the SO phase. For JQ2 > 0, the degeneracy is fully lifted, leading to a two-sublattice Néel type AFQ order, see Fig. [\ref=fig:SOlift] (c). However the massive degeneracy is partially lifted for JQ2 < 0 and we find that a highly degenerate state with purely quadrupolar nature is stabilized. This degenerate phase can be constructed by filling the square lattice with three purely quadrupolar state (e.g. [formula] , [formula] and [formula]) by requiring all NN bonds featuring orthogonal state, see Fig. [\ref=fig:SOlift] (d) for a sketch on a plaquette. We call this phase degenerate AFQ. In fact, the ground state configuration for the degenerate AFQ phase on the square lattice has been extensively studied with only NN bilinear and biquadratic interactions [\cite=Papanicolaou1988367] and it is recently proposed that a peculiar three-sublattice ordering is selected by quantum fluctuations [\cite=PhysRevLett.105.265301] [\cite=PhysRevB.85.140403].

(ii) Lift of degeneracy in the decoupled AFM phase. It is easy to show that only JQ1 has consequence on the ground state energy. We find that the degeneracy due to the continuous rotation between the two decoupled lattices will be fully lifted in the presence of finite NN quadrupolar coupling, leading to a collinear configuration (CAFM phase) with NN spin moments being parallel for JQ1 > 0 and an orthomagnetic (OM) phase with NN spin moments being perpendicular for JQ1 < 0. The collinear phase has a twofold degeneracy with ordering wave vector (π,0) or (0,π) while the OM phase preserves the tertragonal lattice symmetry [\cite=PhysRevB.91.024401]. We depict these two phases in Fig. [\ref=fig:DAFMlift](a) and (b), respectively.

(iii) Lift of degeneracy in the decoupled FM phase. It can be shown that the decoupled FM phase is unstable with the perturbation of all NN dipolar and quadrupolar couplings. The selection mechanism is strongly dependent on the sign of the interactions. In particular, we find that the FM phase is selected by JD1 < 0, the AFM phase is selected by JD1 > 0 and the OM phase is selected by JQ1 < 0. However, for JQ1 > 0 both the FM and AFM phase are the variational ground states.

(iv) Lift of degeneracy in the decoupled FQ phase. We find that the degeneracy in the decoupled FQ phase is only lifted by the presence NN quadrupolar couplings. A uniform FQ order is selected by JQ1 > 0 while the Néel AFQ order is selected by JQ1 < 0.

(v) Lift of degeneracy in the decoupled SO phase. The decoupled SO phase is unstable with the perturbation of all NN dipolar and quadrupolar couplings.

In the presence of perturbed NN dipolar interaction JD1, one can obtain two different phases with mixed dipolar and quadrupolar characters. In particular, one finds the ground state manifold will feature alternate dipolar and quadrupolar alignments along the columns (rows) with collinear directors and moments. Since the directors of the quadrupolar alignment should be parallel to their adjacent spin moments, we call this phase stripe FQ+AFM for JD1 > 0 and FQ+FM for JD1 < 0. We depict the two phases on a plaquette in Fig. [\ref=fig:DSOlift](a) and (b). Notice that the two stripe phases on the square lattice are still infinitely degenerate since the every AFM/FM column (row) is decoupled. Thus the degeneracy is only partially lifted in this case.

In the presence of perturbed NN quadrupolar interactions, one still obtains two highly degenerate phases. For JQ1 > 0, the variational results support a peculiar purely quadrupolar phase with two decoupled Néel AFQ lattice, see Fig. [\ref=fig:DSOlift](c). In this case, it is expected that a quantum order-by-disorder mechanism can break the continuous degeneracy due to the arbitrary angle between the staggered directors of these two sublattice, leading to a FQ alignment along one direction with parallel directors between two NN sites and an alternate AFQ configuration along the the other direction with orthogonal directors between two NN sites. We note that the effect of additional third NN interactions is important to stabilize a genuine two-sublattice collinear AFQ (CAFQ) phase with ordering wave vector (π,0) / (0,π). The (π,0) AFQ order is recently proposed to explain the curious magnetic properties and nematicity of FeSe, see Ref. [\cite=PhysRevLett.115.116401]. For JQ1 < 0, the degeneracy of one diagonal SO bond on a plaquette will be lifted, leading to a purely quadrupolar configuration with orthogonal directors, while the the degeneracy of the other diagonal SO bond is still preserved, see Fig. [\ref=fig:DSOlift](d) for an illustration. We denote this phase as degenerate SO.

Phase diagram relevant to iron-based SCs

Based on the above variational analysis, we find that the extended BBQ model ([\ref=BBQmodel]) can support various ground state manifolds including conventional spin dipolar orderings (ferro- or antiferromagnet), novel quadrupolar (spin nematic) orderings and mixed dipolar-quadrupolar orderings. An exhaustive phase diagram can be mapped out by comparing the ground state energy of different phases. Since we are interested in the emergence of possible new ground states relevant to iron-based SCs, we restrict our discussion to JQ1 > 0 (or K1 > 0) regime where the (π,0) CAFM phase for iron pnictides is stabilized in the presence of dominant antiferromagnetic J2 interaction. Henceforth, we will set J2 = 1 as the energy unit in order to incorporate the NNN antiferromagnetic superexchange processes in iron pnictides and chalcogenides.

A portion of the variational phase diagram under the influence of tunable K1 and K2 interactions is mapped out in Fig. [\ref=fig:Phasediagram] for several J1 interactions. We see that for strong NN biquadratic coupling K1 the ground state consists of FQ or AFM ordering since K1 enhances both antiferromagnetic dipolar coupling as well as ferroquadrupolar coupling among NN sites according to Eq. ([\ref=BQterm]). The CAFM phase occupies the upper left part of the phase diagram since a large and positive K2 interaction will enhance the NNN antiferromagnetic dipolar coupling and the presence of moderate K1 > 0 will select the collinear phase at the variational level. The most interesting feature is in the lower left part of the phase diagram. We find that for J1 < 0 it is separated by a mixed dipolar-quadrupolar phase (stripe FQ+FM) and a purely quadrupolar phase (decoupled AFQ). While for [formula] the stripe FQ+FM disappears from the phase diagram and another mixed phase (stripe FQ+AFM) dominates the whole lower left region for J1 > 0. Thus the emergence of a nonuniform purely quadrupolar phase, including the proposed (π,0) AFQ phase relevant to FeSe, is only realized for J1 < 0.

SU(3) flavor-wave theory

Since the quadrupolar operators are related to the generators of SU(3) Lie algebra, the spin dipolar and quadrupolar order parameters fluctuate in the SU(3) space instead of the SU(2) space of local spin rotations [\cite=Muniz01082014]. The SU(3) flavor-wave theory for spin-1 systems starts from introducing three-flavor Schwinger bosons (SBs) a†μ (with μ = 1,2,3) which create the three local spin-1 basis [formula] and satisfiy the local constraint

[formula]

For the description of conventional spin dopolar phases, it is convenient to use the usual Sz basis [formula], while the time-reversal invariant basis [formula] is used for the study of quadrupolar phases. In terms of the SBs, the local spin and quadrupolar operators have bilinear forms which are constructed by the eight generators of SU(3) group in the fundamental representation [\cite=Auerbach2012]. In the next we investigate the dynamic properties of the BBQ model in the (π,0) CAFM phase within the framework of SU(3) flavor-wave theory.

General results for the (π,0) CAFM phase

The three-flavor SBs which create the three local spin-1 basis are introduced as

[formula]

and satisfiy the local constraint ([\ref=constraint]). In terms of the three-flavor SBs, the local spin and quadrupolar operators are constructed by the fundamental representation of SU(3) Lie algebra which have the following bilinear forms [\cite=Batista10.1080] [\cite=RevModPhys.86.563]

[formula]

In order to study the two-sublattice CAFM phase, it is convenient to perform a local rotation in the spin space

[formula]

where [formula] is the corresponding ordering wave vector. In the local frame, the following mean-field ground state is stabilized

[formula]

The leading quantum correction above the mean-field ground state is described by the SU(3) flavor-wave theory which is implemented via the condensation of the boson a3 under the local constraint ([\ref=constraint])

[formula]

The SB operators (a1,a2) thus play the role of the Holstein-Primakoff bosons in the SU(2) spin-wave theory which describe the fluctuations around the variational ground state. After performing the Fourier transformation, we obtain the quadratic SU(3) flavor-wave Hamiltonian

[formula]

where

[formula]

The resulting Hamiltonian can be diagonalized via a Bogoliubov transformation

[formula]

with

[formula]

The elementary excitation spectrum consists of two branches

[formula]

According to ([\ref=cafmSBs]), we find that the operator a†1 creates an excitation with ΔSz = 2, the corresponding branch [formula] has a quadrupolar (nematic) character, which is the bound state of two magnons and always gapped in the magnetic dipolar phase. While a†2 creates an excitation with ΔSz = 1, the corresponding branch [formula] is the conventional magnon mode (Goldstone mode) with gapless excitations. The quasiparticle dispersion for several representative points in the phase diagram of the CAFM phase is shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:flavordispersion]. We see that when the system approaches a nematic critical point, as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:flavordispersion](a), the high-energy branch eventually becomes gapless excitations, signaling the onset of quadrupolar order. It is already clear from Eq. ([\ref=CAFdisp]) that the low-energy magnon spectrum has zeros at [formula] and [formula] in the two-dimensional Brillouin zone, see Fig. [\ref=fig:flavordispersion](b).

Spin-wave dispersion of iron pnictides

We now discuss the applicability of the extended BBQ model for iron pnictides and determine which regime in the parameter space is the most relevant to the experimentally observed spin-wave dispersion. Experimentally, the magnon dispersion is best known for the 122 compounds CaFe2As2 [\cite=NatPhys.5.555] and BaFe2As2 [\cite=PhysRevB.84.054544]. Hence we fit the dispersion obtained by the SU(3) flavor-wave theory of the BBQ model ([\ref=BBQmodel]) to the measured spin-wave dispersion for iron pnictides. Then we are able to compare the exchange values with those obtained by the conventional SU(2) spin-wave approaches, see Appendix [\ref=App:SU(2)SWT] for a general introduction to the spin-wave theory.

To address this issue we would like to make a brief review of previous efforts. The experimentally observed INS spectrum of CAFM iron pnictides exhibits a striking feature, namely, the spin-wave energy approximately forms a maximum at (π,π) point [\cite=NatPhys.5.555] [\cite=PhysRevB.84.054544] [\cite=PhysRevB.84.155108]. This distinct feature can not explained by a simple Heisenberg J1 - J2 model which predicts a minimum at (π,π) point [\cite=PhysRevB.78.052507] [\cite=PhysRevB.79.092416] [\cite=PhysRevB.83.144528]. The initial fits are performed by a phenomenological Jx - Jy - J2 model with antiferromagnetic Jx and nearly ferromagnetic Jy, which are impossible to reconcile even when the small orthorhombic lattice distortion is taken into account. Therefore, it is of great importance to formulate a minimum effective spin model which can both capture the correct spin-wave spectrum and preserve the tetragonal lattice symmetry. Such efforts are subsequently made by the inclusion of a biquadratic coupling between NN sites which is just the celebrated J1 - J2 - K model. The J1 - J2 - K model studied in Refs. [\cite=NatPhys.7.485] [\cite=PhysRevB.86.085148] [\cite=PhysRevB.85.144403] is based on a mean-field decoupling of the biquadratic term which is shown to be identical to the Jx - Jy - J2 model, see Appendix [\ref=App:SU(2)SWT] for a exact mapping between these two models under a Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. Thus such fit gives the traditionally accepted magnetic exchange interactions with J1 = 22 meV, J2 = 19 meV and K = 14 meV for CaFe2As2 and J1 = 25 meV, J2 = 14 meV and K = 17 meV for BaFe2As2. However, the limitations of the mean-field decoupling are realized subsequently by authors in Refs. [\cite=PhysRevB.84.064505] [\cite=PhysRevB.92.165102] where they carry out a nonlinear spin-wave calculation and find that the experimental spectra can not be well captured even with fairly large biquadratic coupling, namely, the spin-wave energy always forms a local maximum at (π,π) point.

However, we have to point out that all of these fittings carried out in previous works are based on the assumption of J1  ≈  J2. Actually it was previously realized in Ref. [\cite=PhysRevLett.101.076401] that the NN coupling J1 in iron pnictides may be strongly differs with the dominant antiferromagnetic J2 interaction by fully taking into account the As bridging superexchange processes and a ferromagnetic J1 interactionwas is also proposed in some iron chalcogendes, see Table I in Ref. [\cite=PhysRevB.85.144403] for a summary of the exchange constants in various iron compounds. In addition, the dramatic reduction or even sign change of J1 / J2 signals the importance of the p orbitals of As or Te/Se on the influence of magnetism in iron-based SCs.

In the present work, we will extend the fit by comprising a tunable J1 interaction ranging from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic in the framework of SU(3) flavor-wave theory. We find that for J1  ≈  J2 scenario, the existence of local minimun at (π,π) is robust against the both the NN and NNN biquadratic interactions which is in good agreement with the nonlinear SU(2) spin-wave theory prediction [\cite=PhysRevB.92.165102]. The best fit of the experimental magnon dispersion for Ca(Ba)Fe2As2 under J1  ≪  J2 scenario in the framework of SU(3) flavor-wave theory is achieved for J1 =  - 0.1J2, K1 = 0.9J2 and K2 =  - 0.5J2 with the energy scale J2 = 50 meV, see Fig. [\ref=fig:DispersionFit].

Dynamic correlation functions

Spin dynamic structure factors

Neutron scattering cross section is directly related to the diagonal components of the spin dipolar dynamical structure factor (DSF), or the dynamical spin-spin correlation function

[formula]

where α0 and β0 refer to spin dipolar components in the laboratory frame {x0,y0,z0}. Using ([\ref=rotation]), we obtain the spin dipolar DSF in the rotating frame

[formula]

In Eq. ([\ref=rotatingDSF]) one can readily identify the conventional transverse and longitudinal components of the DSF which are respectively given by

[formula]

In order to determine the leading contributions of the one- and two-particle excitations to the total DSF in ([\ref=rotatingDSF]), the spin operators are expanded to the quadratic terms according to ([\ref=su3operators]) with the help of ([\ref=hpexpansion]), leading to

[formula]

According to Eq. ([\ref=sexpand]) the transverse DSF can be expressed as

[formula]

with

[formula]

Apart from the coherent part ST1 which is contributed by the single-magnon excitation, one can clearly see that the transverse DSF also consists of a two-particle continuum. The incoherent spectrum ST2 which can not be identified by SU(2) spin-wave theory represents the simultaneous excitation of a magnon mode ε2 plus a quadrupolar mode ε1 . In Fig. [\ref=fig:DSFpipi](a) we present the transverse DSF at momentum point (π,π) for CaFe2As2. The coherent spectra show a δ function peak exactly at the spin-wave energy of [formula], while the high-energy incoherent continuum ranges from about 6J2 to 11J2. Similarly, we find that the inelastic part of longitudinal DSF consists of two incoherent excitations

[formula]

with

[formula]

Thus the longitudinal DSF describes the excitations of two quadrupolar modes (SLa) and two magnon modes (SLb) while the former can not be identified by SU(2) spin-wave theory either. In Fig. [\ref=fig:DSFpipi](b) we display the inelastic part of longitudinal DSF at momentum point (π,π) for CaFe2As2. It is interesting to point out that the two continua are separated by a finite gap with SLa(b) contributing to high(low)-energy spectra.

The total DSF at momentum point (π,π) for CaFe2As2 is shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:DSFpipi](c). Though the two longitudinal continua SLa and SLb have no overlap, the transverse continuum ST2 bridges the gap and the three different continua give rise to a robust high-energy sideband which may be verified experimentally.

Quadrupolar dynamic structure factors

Moreover one will see that the correlation functions of spin quadrupolar operators will also come into play even in the conventional magnetic dipolar phases. To access the fingerprint of quadrupolar correlations, we will consider the spin quadrupolar DSF

[formula]

where we have kept the experimental details unspecified and calculate the quadrupolar DSF in the diagonalized representation. Though the quadrupolar DSF can not be directly seen in conventional neutron probes, it may be detected by optical measurements [\cite=PhysRevB.84.184424] at certain conditions and it is recently proposed that the momentum resolved quadrupolar DSF can be experimentally discernible in resonant inelastic x-ray scattering spectroscopy [\cite=arXiv:1506.04752]. In order to determine the leading contributions of the coherent and incoherent excitations, the quadrupolar operators can be also expanded to the quadratic terms according to ([\ref=su3operators]) with the help of ([\ref=hpexpansion]), leading to

[formula]

It is clear to see that the correlation function of Q3z2 - r2 can give rise to elastic scattering cross section in experimental probes. The presence of magnetic Bragg peak in quadrupolar DSF in the conventional magnets does not signal any quadrupolar order parameter but exhibits the intrinsic properties of spin-1 systems. The comparison of the spin dipolar and quadrupolar DSF of iron pnictides is shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:DSFsq] where we have only calculated the dominated coherent spectra. The low-energy magnon mode is revealed in the spin DSF with strong intensity near the antiferromagnetic wave vector (π,0) and gapless excitations at (0,0) zero point, see Fig. [\ref=fig:DSFsq](a). However, both the low-energy magnon mode and high-energy quadrupolar mode are simultaneously revealed in the quadrupolar DSF, see Fig. [\ref=fig:DSFsq](b). Note that in the quadrupolar DSF, the quadrupolar branch has a gap of about 2J2 which is directly accessible by experimental measurements.

To better understand the spectral weight of DSFs in momentum space, we also present the constant energy cuts of [formula] and [formula] in Fig. [\ref=fig:DSFscan]. At low energies, as displayed in Figs. [\ref=fig:DSFscan](a) and (d), the spin dipolar and quadrupolar DSF show similar structure with elliptic rings emerging from the magnetic ordering vector (π,0). This is not surprising since only magnon excitations come into play below the energy gap of quadrupolar branch. With increasing energy, the rings increase with size, see Figs. [\ref=fig:DSFscan](b) and (e). The peculiar feature of the quadrupolar DSF is the presence of two concentric rings when the cutting energies are above the gap. The inner one is attributed to the coherent excitations of quadrupolar mode. For sufficiently high energy, the spectral weight of the dipolar DSF decreases greatly and ultimately disappears as the cutting energy exceeds the band width of the magnon dispersion, see Fig. [\ref=fig:DSFscan](c). Thus in the energy interval between the maximum energy of magnon and quadrupolar dispersion, only quadrupolar DSF persists which forms stripe patterns, see Fig. [\ref=fig:DSFscan](f).

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

To summarize, we have studied the variational phase diagram of the extended BBQ model by incorporating both NN and NNN exchange couplings on the square lattice. In spite of the (π,0) CAFM phase relevant to iron pnictides, various magnetic orderings including conventional spin dipolar orderings, novel quadrupolar (spin nematic) orderings and mixed dipolar-quadrupolar orderings are identified. This suggests that it is possible to find these novel orders in close proximity to the CAFM phase in the phase diagram in certain materials, e.g. the (π,0) AFQ order in FeSe.

We have also calculated the elementary excitation spectrum in the (π,0) CAFM phase within the framework of SU(3) flavor-wave theory. By fitting the experimental spin-wave dispersion, we have obtained the most relevant exchange constants for iron pnictides. It is suggested that the NN billinear coupling J1 given by the SU(3) flavor-wave theory differs strongly with previous predictions achieved by conventional SU(2) spin-wave theory.

Finally, we have presented the dynamical correlations of both spin dipolar for quadrupolar components for iron pnictides. The spin dipolar and quadrupolar DSFs can be directly probed with future experiments in INS and RIXS spectroscopies. Our results are consistent with and go beyond prior studies with conventional SU(2) spin-wave theory where the quadrupolar nature can not be captured.

SU(2) spin-wave theory for the BBQ model

Here we use the conventional SU(2) spin-wave theory to study the BBQ model ([\ref=BBQmodel]) and compare the result with the SU(3) favor-wave theory. The Schwinger representation of SU(2) algebra is defined by introducing two boson, a and b. The spin operators can be written as

[formula]

along with the constraint

[formula]

The Holstein-Primakoff (HP) transformation is introduced to desccribe the broken symmetry phases by condensing one of the two bosons with the constraint ([\ref=su2constraint]). In the local rotating frame, we can define the following HP transformation

[formula]

The quadratic SU(2) spin-wave theory Hamiltonian of the BBQ model ([\ref=BBQmodel]) in the momentum space is given by

[formula]

with

[formula]

It is worth noting that the linear spin-wave theory Hamiltonian of the spin-1 BBQ model can be also obtained from a x  -  y  -  2 model. Actually in the linear spin-wave level the two models are exactly related via the following Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation [\cite=NatPhys.7.485] [\cite=PhysRevB.85.144403] [\cite=PhysRevB.86.085148] [\cite=PhysRevB.92.165102]

[formula]

The resulting Hamiltonian can be diagonalized by a Bogoliubov transformation, leading to the elementary excitation spectrum

[formula]

The dynamic spin correlations can be also calculated by expanding the HP transformation of spin operators to quadratic terms. We find that the transverse DSF consists of only one type of excitations, namely the singe-magnon excitations

[formula]

which shows clear differences when compared with the results given by SU(3) flavor-wave theory.
