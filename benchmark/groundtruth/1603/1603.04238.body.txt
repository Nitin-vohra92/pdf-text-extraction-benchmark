Probing the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation time at the nanoscale

Among the most informative probes of electron systems in solids is the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate 1 / T1. This value quantifies the damping of the nuclear spin precession due to the coupling to the electron spins. This in turn can be related to the momentum averaged imaginary part of the dynamical spin susceptibility of the electron system, measured at the very low Larmor frequency of the nuclear spins. This is a most useful quantity revealing basic physics of the electron system. For instance, in Fermi liquids like copper, the Korringa relation [\cite=Korringa1950], 1 / (T1T)  =   constant, universally holds, while non-Korringa behaviors have played a pivotal role in establishing the unconventional nature of various strongly interacting electron systems [\cite=Alloul2014]. This mainstay of traditional NMR methods has been hampered by the fact that it is a very weak signal that usually can only be detected in bulk samples [\cite=Glover2002]. We will demonstrate here an important step forward towards turning this into a nanoscopic probe, by delivering proof of principle that 1 / T1 can be measured at subKelvin temperatures using Magnetic Resonance Force Microscopy (MRFM). State of the art MRFM has demonstrated an imaging resolution of < 10 nm, a 100-million fold improvement in volume resolution over bulk NMR, by detecting the proton spins in a virus particle [\cite=Degen2009]. In their experiment the statistical polarization of the protons was measured, since the Boltzmann polarization was too small to detect.

Measurements of the recovery of the Boltzmann polarization after radiofrequent pulses relate directly to spin-lattice relaxation times. The force gradient detection of T1 was measured before in GaAs at temperatures down to 4.8 K [\cite=Alexson2012]. In this paper we demonstrate T1 measurements (see Fig. [\ref=fig:figure2](a)) at temperatures which are lower by two orders of magnitude and a volume sensitivity of three orders of magnitude larger. Furthermore we obtain the temperature dependence of the relaxation time T1 satisfying quantitatively the Korringa relation of copper, see Fig. [\ref=fig:figure3]. This is a major step forward towards the ultimate goal of a device that can measure variations of T1 at the nanoscale to study the properties of the inhomogeneous electron systems which are at the forefront of modern condensed matter physics, such as the surface states of topological insulators [\cite=Chen2009], oxide interfaces [\cite=Mannhart2010] [\cite=Richter2013] [\cite=Kalisky2013] [\cite=Scopigno2016] and strongly correlated electron systems [\cite=Dagotto2005] including the high-Tc superconductors [\cite=Keimer2015].

MRFM uses a magnetic particle attached to an ultrasoft cantilever (Fig. [\ref=fig:figure1](a)) to detect the force gradients between sample spins and the tip. In most MRFM apparatuses a laser is used to read out the motion of the cantilever. The spins in the sample are manipulated using radio-frequent (RF) currents that are applied using a copper or gold nanowire [\cite=Poggio2007] [\cite=Isaac2016]. The laser and large RF currents in the copper or gold nanowires prevent experiments at milliKelvin temperatures. To our knowledge, sample temperatures below 4.2 K have not been verified, only that the working temperature of the cryostat can remain at 300 mK [\cite=Degen2009]. In our setup, a Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) [\cite=Usenko2011] [\cite=Vinante2011] [\cite=Vinante2012] is used combined with a superconducting RF wire (Fig. [\ref=fig:figure1](b)). This enables us to perform nuclear MRFM experiments down to temperatures of 42 mK, and we are able to verify that the sample indeed remains at this temperature.

The experimental setup closely resembles the one that was recently used to measure the dangling bonds on a silicon substrate [\cite=Haan2015]. The NdFeB magnetic particle is [formula] μm in diameter, and has a saturation magnetization of 1.15 T. The cantilever's natural resonance frequency is f0 = 3.0 kHz with a mechanical quality factor of [formula], when far away from the surface. An in-house developed cryopositioning system is used to move the cantilever relative to the sample with a range of 1 mm in all dimensions. The absolute position of the cantilever is measured using three capacitive sensors. The sample holder is placed on a finestage which is used to change the height of the sample in a range of 2.3 μm.

For the fabrication of the detection chip consisting of a superconducting RF wire, a pickup coil, and the copper sample, we started with a NbTiN film on a silicon wafer with its natural oxide. The film has an average thickness of 378 nm, a resistivity of 92 μΩ cm and a critical temperature of 15.3 K. Using standard electron beam lithography techniques, with a negative resist, we patterned the RF wire structure and pick-up coil. We used reactive ion etching in a SF6/O2 plasma to etch the film. The copper is sputtered with a thickness of 300 nm and a roughness of 10 nm. In order to prevent oxidation of the copper, a gold capping layer of 15 nm was sputtered while the sample remained in high vacuum. The copper sample is thermalized using a patterned copper wire leading to a large copper area, which is connected to the sample holder via gold wire bonds. The sample holder is connected to the mixing chamber of the dilution refrigerator via a welded silver wire.

We positioned the cantilever above the copper, as indicated by a small black dot in Fig. [\ref=fig:figure1](b), close ([formula] μm) to the center of the RF wire and close ([formula] μm) to the pick up coil for sufficient signal strength. While approaching the copper, we measured an enormous drop in the quality factor of the cantilever towards Q = 300 which strongly depends on the distance to the sample. This is caused by eddy currents in the copper induced by the magnetic fields of the magnetic particle attached to the moving cantilever. The drop in quality factor limited the minimal height above the surface, reducing the signal strength.

Natural copper exists in two isotopes. Both isotopes have a spin S = 3 / 2, 63Cu has a natural abundance of 69% and a gyromagnetic ratio 63γ / (2π) = 11.3 MHz/T and 65Cu has a natural abundance of 31% and a gyromagnetic ratio 65γ / (2π) = 12.1 MHz/T. In fcc-copper there is no quadrupolar coupling, since electric field gradients are zero given the cubic symmetry.

The magnetic particle on the cantilever couples to all nuclear spins in the sample via it's field gradient. Every spin effectively shifts the resonance frequency of the cantilever by an amount Δfs. The alignment of the nuclear spins will be perturbed when a radio-frequent pulse is applied to the sample. The spins that meet the resonance condition [formula] are said to be in the resonance slice, where fRF is the RF frequency and B0 the local magnetic field. The total frequency shift due to all the spins within a resonance slice can be calculated by the summation of the single spin contributions [formula], where p is the net Boltzmann polarization of the nuclear spins. We present analytic expressions for the single spin contributions and the outcome of the summation over the resonance slice in the Supplemental Material . Those spins losing their net Boltzmann polarization (i.e., [formula]) will cause a total frequency shift of -  Δf0. This effect can be obtained at low radio frequent magnetic fields in a saturation experiment with low enough currents to prevent heating of the sample.

A RF current of 0.2 mA is applied in all measurements. Taking the approximation of a circular wire, we estimate the typical field strength in the rotating frame for a current of 0.2 mA at a distance r = 7 μm to be [formula]T. The RF-field is mostly perpendicular to B0 (see Fig. [\ref=fig:figure1](c)). The saturation parameter [formula] [\cite=Abragam1961] is used to calculate the ratio of total saturation which is given by [formula]. For temperatures T < 250 mK, the expected values for the relaxation times are T1 > 5 s. Given a T2 = 0.15 ms [\cite=Pobell2007], the saturation parameter becomes s > 30, indicating that the spin saturation will be at least 95%, for those spins that satisfy the resonance condition. Since we work with field gradients, there will always be spins which are not fully saturated. For the sake of simplicity, we assume that we have a resonance slice thickness d, within which the spins are fully saturated. The Rabi frequency is [formula] Hz, so we assume that for pulse lengths of 1 s all levels are fully saturated. When all levels saturate, the magnetization after a pulse will restore according to a single exponential, with a decay time equal to the spin-lattice relaxation time T1. The frequency shift of the cantilever is proportional to the magnetization, and the time dependent resonance frequency f(t) becomes:

[formula]

We use the Phase Locked Loop (PLL) of a Zurich Instruments lock-in amplifier to measure the shifts in resonance frequency of the cantilever at a bandwidth of 40 Hz . The measurement scheme is as follows: first we measure the natural resonance frequency f0 using a PLL. The PLL is turned off and the RF-current is turned on for one second. At t0 the RF current is turned off. Shortly after the PLL is turned on and we measure the frequency shift relative to f0. The PLL is switched off during and shortly after the RF pulse in order to avoid crosstalk.

At frequencies larger than 1 MHz and currents higher than 1 mA, we measure a milliKelvin increase in the temperature of the sample. The dissipation of the RF wire will be subject of further study, since for nanoscale imaging based on (proton) density, the magnetic RF fields need to be large (> 3 mT) enough for adiabatic rapid passages [\cite=Poggio2007]. In this Letter, we avoid the large currents in order to prevent heating.

In Fig. [\ref=fig:figure2](a) we show a representative plot of a saturation recovery measurement performed at a temperature of 42 mK and a RF frequency of 542 kHz. The cantilever was positioned at a height of approximately 1.5 μm above the surface of the copper. At fRF = 542 kHz, the measured frequency shifts were larger than those observed at other frequencies. This is caused by the presence of a higher resonance mode of the cantilever which can be driven by the magnetic field of the RF wire. The resulting increased motion of the magnetic particle at the end of the cantilever gives an additional RF-field that will increase the number of spins that are saturated. The exact mechanism for this will be presented in a different paper . We measured the frequency shift up to t = 50 s and averaged 50 times. Subsequently, the data is fitted to Eq. [\ref=eq:fitting] to extract Δf0, T1 and a residual frequency offset δf0

The direct frequency shift Δf0 is plotted versus temperature in Fig. [\ref=fig:figure2](b) and fitted with a straight line according to the expected Curie's law [formula], which implicitly assumes that the resonance slice thickness is temperature independent. Δf0 shows a saturation at the lowest temperatures. This indicates that the (electron) spins are difficult to cool, although the saturation could also be caused by the approach of minimum temperature of the refrigerator. For every temperature, we collected at least three sets of 50 curves. The error bars are the standard deviations calculated from the separate fits.

In Fig. [\ref=fig:figure2](c) the direct frequency shift is plotted versus RF-frequency for three different cantilever heights. Every data point resembles a data set of 50 averaged single measurements. The solid line is a numerical calculation, with the only fitting parameters the resonance slice width and height of the cantilever above the surface. The height of the cantilever is left a fitting parameter, because the absolute height is not known with sufficient accuracy, due to the nonlinear behavior of the piezostack in the finestage.

Several mechanisms will contribute to the resonance slice thickness, for example the width of the resonant slice is determined by the NMR line width, i.e. the saturation parameter, and may be further broadened by the nuclear spin diffusion and by the resonant displacement of the cantilever. Below we discuss these various contributions. . This results in a variation of the thickness at different locations of the resonance slice. For the calculations of this experiment we have taken the resonant slice thickness to be uniform over the resonance slice.

For two different RF-frequencies, 542 kHz and 625 kHz, at two different heights, 1.54 μm and 1.31 μm, we measured the relaxation time T1 versus temperature. The results are shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:figure3]. We observe a linear dependence of T1 on the temperature, following the Korringa law T1T = κ. T is the electron temperature and κ is the Korringa constant. From the linear fits we extract [formula] sK and [formula] sK, which is close to the expected value of the combined 63Cu and 65Cu Korringa constants, κ = 1.2 sK [\cite=Pobell2007], which is measured in bulk copper.

In conclusion, by performing nuclear magnetic resonance force microscopy experiments down to 42 mK, we have demonstrated that the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation time T1 can be detected by measuring the spin polarization in a volume of about 3000  ×  3000  ×  30 nm3, see Fig. [\ref=fig:figure1](c). A much smaller volume would give the same signal-to-noise ratio when a different sample than copper is measured and a smaller magnetic particle is used. First, copper is such a good conductor that our experiment is hampered by the eddy currents generated in the copper due to the motion of the magnetic force sensor. The subsequent drop in quality factor increases the frequency noise in the measurements with an order of magnitude. This prevented us from performing experiments at smaller tip-sample heights. When the magnet is closer to the sample, the magnetization of the nuclei is also larger. Secondly, we improved the operation temperature of the fridge, such that future experiments can be performed at 10 mK.

By taking the ratio between the frequency noise within a bandwidth of 1 Hz at a Q > 1000 and the frequency shift of a single spin when the height between magnet and sample is minimal, we find a volume sensitivity of [formula]. Further improvements are possible when using smaller magnets on the force sensor [\cite=Overweg2015], which provide much higher field gradients. Previous measurements of the relaxation time with MRFM [\citep=Alexson2012] had a volume sensitivity three orders of magnitude smaller [\cite=Garner2004]. Our volume sensitivity is at least 4 orders of magnitude larger than that can theoretically be achieved in bulk NMR, and even 10 orders larger than is usually reported in solid state NMR [\cite=Glover2002]. Our results show that our technique is promising for studying the properties of inhomogenuous electron systems, such as topological insulators, oxide interfaces and strongly correlated electron systems.
