Efficiency calculation of thermoelectric generator by extracting waste heat, for practical applications

]

INTRODUCTION

Now a day, due to heavy industrialization and increased demand of power for day to day life applications, we need to supply an enormous amount of energy. Mostly energy is being produced by coal, petroleum, hydro, solar, wind, nuclear, etc., where globally around 65% of electrical energy is being produced by coal and petroleum only. We can see the extent of our dependency on non-renewable natural resources, where stocks are limited. If we keep on using these non renewable sources with the same pace, currently available stocks are going to be exhausted in next 50 years. If we take the example of India, where around 70% of power is being produced by thermal plant[\cite=india], which fully depends on the limited resources of fossil fuels. These thermal plants operate at around 32% efficiency, which means approximately 68% of energy is being wasted out. Same situation is also with automotive sector where around two third of energy is being wasted out[\cite=tervo]. So if there is any possibility to extract some useful energy from that waste heat, then it will help us to reduce our dependencies over coal and petroleum to some extent[\cite=leblanc]. For extracting energy from waste heat, we have thermoelectric generators (TEG) made of thermoelectric materials are the best candidate. TEG has many novel qualities such as it is Eco-friendly, it has no having moving parts that's why it needs less maintenance, etc.

In spite of the above mentioned novelty of TEG, there are certain challenges in developing a good TEG for a particular application and one of them is efficiency. As we know that the TEG works on the principle[\cite=rodger] of temperature difference between two ends of sample, which creates a potential difference between hot and cold ends of sample. Consequently, electrical energy is produced. The efficiency in general is defined as:-

[formula]

The maximum efficiency[\cite=sherman] of a TEG using thermoelectric materials, also includes the materials related parameter, which is defined as,

[formula]

Where [formula], Th and Tc are source and sink temperature, respectively. z is called as figure of merit[\cite=rowe] where z is defined as

[formula]

In above equation s, σ, λ are Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity respectively, of material used for making TEG[\cite=taylor]. Above formula for ηmax gives us criterion for selecting a material for fabricating TEG, which suggests that higher the z higher will be the ηmax for a fixed value of Th and Tc. Here z appears as constant, however z has temperature dependence[\cite=tritt] through equation (3). If z has appreciable temperature dependence in a given temperature range of application, then direct use of equation will not give accurate value for ηmax. Although it appears to be simple, but because of its temperature dependence through equation (3), use of equation (2) becomes tricky if z varies appreciably in a given temperature range. So to overcome that problem we have formulated a technique of segmentation of sample and successfully reached to reasonable results. First, we took under consideration within fixed temperature difference and found out efficiency within that region. Simultaneously, we calculated efficiency of TAGS and SiGe for some operating temperature range. Keeping application point of view in mind, we can think about automobile sector[\cite=snyder2008] where usually higher temperature remains as fixed. For that we calculated temperature dependent efficiency of Bi2Te3, TAGS and SiGe keeping higher temperature fixed and varying lower temperature as per their favorable operating temperature range where their z value is more.

METHODOLOGY

In order to calculate the ηmax from the temperature dependence data of z, we have divided working temperature range in "n" number of segments as shown in figure 1. Where Th and Tc denotes the temperature of hot and cold ends, respectively. For that small segmented temperature difference we can assume fixed value of z. This temperature difference of each segment can be decided by looking at the temperature dependent behavior of z for the sample. The number of slicing will depend on the temperature range of our sliced part. If ΔT is a temperature difference across each slice which gives an almost constant value of z in that region. Then the number of segments will be [formula]. First, consider segment 1, for which ΔT  =  Th - T1, where Th and T1 are defined as [formula], [formula] and z is the figure of merit for this segment, which is assumed to be constant for ΔT. By putting z, Th and T1 in equation (2), we get the efficiency of segment (1), i.e,

[formula]

Similarly, by using the above procedure for each segment, we can get the efficiency of all individual segments, which are η1, η2, η3.....ηn for 1st, 2nd, 3rd....nth segment, respectively. Considering all the individual segmented efficiency[\cite=okamoto] that are in series, we can apply the fundamental law of thermodynamics for efficiency calculation of cascaded system[\cite=chen],[\cite=zhang]. Which gives overall efficiency of TEG as[\cite=ybarrondo]

Result and Discussion

It is clear from above discussed method that one can calculate the efficiency of a TEG works in a given temperature range where z has temperature dependence. Now we want to verify the accuracy of the calculated efficiency using above method by comparing with experimentally observed efficiency. First of all we apply the method for Bi2Te3 in the temperature range of Th=585 K and Tc= 310 K. Here we have considered ΔT = 10 and used the temperature dependent z data from the literature. Consequently segmentation of sample is done, which are 28 in number. For the first segment  = 580K. Using the value of [formula], ΔT and z = 0.125 at 580 K in equation 4, we get η1 = 0.000509%. Using the similar procedure, we got the efficiency of the consecutive layers which are η2 = 0.000581%......η28 = 0.004472%. Using all these segmented efficiencies in equation (5), we got ηoverall = 7.1%[\cite=sano]. The result obtained through this approach is close to the experimental value of 7% in the temperature range of 585-310 K. Using this procedure, we have also calculated the overall efficiency for TAGS material, in the temperature range of 830-580 K. The calculated value comes out to be 8.95%, which is in good agreement with the experimental result[\cite=salzgeber]. In this case we have used the z data reported in ref[\cite=snyder2004]. Here we considered the total number of segments is 25. The experimental and calculated efficiency of Bi2Te3 and TAGS along with the operating temperature is given in table 1. Here we have also calculated the efficiency for SiGe for operating temperature range of 1260-870 K. In this temperature range total number of segment come out to be 39. The value of z in each segment is taken from fig.(2) of ref [\cite=snyder2004]. In this case the calculated efficiency comes out to 3.5%. In the absence of experimental efficiency, we could not compare the calculated result with the experiment. Hence our result suggests that SiGe is not a good material for TEG in this temperature range. It is clear from the above discussion that by using the temperature dependent data of z one can calculate the efficiency of a TEG operates in a particular temperature range. This method can also be used to calculate the temperature dependent efficiency of TEG when the temperature of one end is fixed and that of other end is varying. We have calculated the temperature dependent efficiency for Bi2Te3 when temperature of cold end is fixed at 310 K and the temperature of hot end is varying in the step of 10 K, up to 590 K. The efficiency when higher temperature is T with Tc is fixed, can be written as

[formula]

Where T = Tc  +  ΔT(n - i + 1) and ΔT is the temperature difference across each segment. Temperature dependent efficiency obtained through this formula is plotted in Fig.(2). Salzgeber er.al [\cite=salzgeber] have also reported experimental temperature dependent efficiency of TEG made up of Bi2Te3 for fixed Tc = 310K. Our data is in good agreement with the data of Salzgeber et.al. It is clear from fig.(2) that the rate of increase of efficiency decreases with increase in temperature. Thus, such graph is expected to be very useful in deciding the economical operating temperature range.The fairly good agreement between our calculated results with the experimental results obtained from TEG suggests the utility of our methods in predicting the efficiency of TEG under various condition by using material properties like s, σ, λ on which figure of merit z depends. It is clear from above discussion that the present method provides us a reliable tool to predict the efficiency of a TEG by using temperature dependent material properties s, σ, λ on z parameter depends through equation (3). Since the temperature dependent data of s, σ, λ for various materials are available in the literature, so this method provides a cheap and efficient way for evaluating the efficiency of a TEG made up of particular materials. Finally, it will help in selecting a proper thermoelectric materials for a particular application.Here we will apply our method on Bi2Te3 , TAGS and SiGe materials for low, medium and high temperature range[\cite=snyder2008complex], respectively to evaluate the applicability in automobile sectors. In automobile sector enormous amount of energy is being wasted out through exhaust port[\cite=meisner]. Extracting some useful energy from that waste heat will reduce our dependencies over natural resources. In automobile case, upper temperature is governed by type of engine installed in that vehicle (keeping other parameter such as velocity, road condition, engine power,etc. constant). So, exhaust port temperature will vary from low, medium, high for LMV (light motor vehicle), LTV (light transport vehicle), HMV (heavy motor vehicle), respectively. In this case the temperature of the hot end will be decided by the exhaust temperature of particular type of vehicles. Thus, here we have estimated the temperature dependent efficiency of TEG with hot end is kept at fixed temperature by varying cold end temperature, which is presented in figure (3). It is important to note that in X-axis, we have taken the relative temperature of the cold end with respect to the hot end. For calculating the absolute temperature of the cold end, we have to subtract the relative temperature from the temperature of hot end. Above calculation is drawn in figure (3). At first we know that hot end temperature is fixed and cold side temperature is surrounding dependent, so for different conditions there will be different cold side temperature. Here calculating temperature difference between two ends of cylindrical Bi2Te3 sample having 0.5 cm diameter and 2 cm long, convective heat transfer coefficient as 5 W / (m2K) by considering conductive as well as convective loss through sample, we found out cold end temperature as 492 K, keeping hot end temperature fixed at 585 K. Similarly, only by doubling the length of sample, we found out Tc = 388K. Through this calculation we can tell about efficiency, only by knowing temperature difference using graph obtained in figure (3) as 1% and 4% respectively for two cases. Consequently, there will be different temperature differences between two ends of TEG for different lengths. For this situation, we have temperature dependent efficiency for different ambient condition. Here cold side temperature is varying from 305-590 K, 580-830 K and 870-1260 K for Bi2Te3, TAGS and SiGe, respectively. These types of curve are very useful for design engineers as it directly provides information about efficiency by knowing temperature difference between hot and cold end. Simultaneously to judge the best possible temperature range for maximizing efficiency of a TEG at various operating temperature range.

CONCLUSION

In this study, we formulated an alternate and precise way to measure efficiency of TEG for power generation as well as an approach for direct calculation of efficiency for a particular temperature difference. We applied one dimensional model for calculating efficiency after considering temperature dependent parameter. Here we imaginarily segmented our sample and used fundamental law of thermodynamics behind cascaded system for calculation of efficiency. This approach allows to do straightforward computation of TEG efficiency for automotive design engineer to fabricate TEG. Whatever approach we applied, that is validated with experimental published results. The basic understanding of efficiency calculation will give us some clue for material selection in designing of TEG, consequently our time and money get saved.
