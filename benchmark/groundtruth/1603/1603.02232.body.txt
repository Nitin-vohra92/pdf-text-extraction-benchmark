Introduction

Motivation

In this paper linear sets of rank t in the projective line [formula] are investigated, where q is a power of a prime p. Such linear sets can be described by means of the field reduction map F  =  F2,t,q [\cite=LaVa2015] mapping any point [formula] to the (t - 1)-subspace of [formula] associated with 〈(a,b)〉qt (considered here as a t-dimensional [formula]-vector subspace). A point set [formula] is said to be [formula]-linear (or just linear) of rank n if L = B(T'), where T' is an (n - 1)-subspace of [formula], and

[formula]

Additionally, each such T' gives rise to the set [formula], which is a collection of (t - 1)-subspaces belonging to the standard Desarguesian spread [formula] of [formula].

If a linear set L of rank n in [formula] has size θn - 1 = (qn - 1) / (q - 1) (which is the maximum size for a linear set of rank n), then L is a scattered linear set. For generalities on the linear sets the reader is referred to [\cite=LaVdV2015], [\cite=LaVa2015], [\cite=LaZa2015], [\cite=LaZa201X], and [\cite=Po2010].

As it has been pointed out in [\cite=LaShZa2015], if L = B(T') is a scattered linear set of rank t in [formula], then the union of all subspaces in [formula] is a hypersurface Q of degree t in [formula], and an embedded product space isomorphic to [formula]. So, Q has two partitions in (t - 1)-subspaces. The first one is U(T'), the second one is [formula], where T'h = {〈(hu,hv)〉q|〈(u,v)〉q∈T'}. By Prop. [\ref=p:caratt-massimali], the family U'(T') can be recovered uniquely from U(T') and T' (disregarding that [formula] is the underlying vector space of our [formula]).

For t = n there is alternative approach to B(T') and U(T') irrespective of whether T' is scattered or not. It is based on the [formula]-endomorphism ring E of [formula] and the projective line [formula] over this ring. On the one hand, there is a bijection Ψ between the projective line [formula] and the Grassmannian G2t,t,q of (t - 1)-subspaces of [formula]. So, instead of T' we may consider its image under Ψ- 1, which is a point T of [formula]. On the other hand, we have a natural embedding [formula]. It maps the linear set B(T') to a subset B(T')ι = :LT of [formula], which in turn is the preimage under Ψ of U(T'). In Section [\ref=s:basic], we take up these ideas, but we start with an equivalent definition, which is in terms of [formula] only, of the set LT. There we also define a second set [formula] in such a way that (L'T)Ψ equals the set U'(TΨ) from above in the scattered case. Furthermore, since T will play a predominant role, B(T') = B(TΨ) will frequently also be denoted by B(T); mutatis mutandis this applies also to U(T') and U'(T').

A special example of a scattered linear set L = B(T) in [formula] is a linear set of pseudoregulus type, defined in [\cite=DoDu2014], [\cite=LuMaPoTr2014], and further investigated in [\cite=CsZa2016]. In our setting it is obtained by taking [formula], where τ is a generator of the Galois group [formula]. The related hypersurface Q in [formula] has been studied in [\cite=LaShZa2015], revealing a high degree of symmetry. As a matter of fact there are t families S0, S1, [formula], St - 1 of (t - 1)-subspaces partitioning Q [\cite=LaShZa2015] where S0  =  U(T) = LΨT and S1  =  U'(T) = (L'T)Ψ are defined above. Furthermore, in [\cite=LaShZa2015] it is proved that the stabilizer of Q inside [formula] contains a dihedral subgroup of order 2t acting on such t families of (t - 1)-subspaces. A consequence thereof is the following result, for which we give a short direct proof in Prop. [\ref=p:zero-converse]: There is a projectivity of [formula] mapping LT onto L'T. For [formula] this turns out to be a characteristic property of the linear sets of pseudoregulus type (Thm. [\ref=t:pseudoreg]). As the projectivities of [formula] and the projectivities of [formula] are in one-to-one correspondence, this leads to the following:

Notation

Let [formula] with t  ≥  2 be the ring of [formula]-linear endomorphisms of [formula]. The ring E has the identity [formula] as its unit element. The multiplicative group comprising all invertible elements of E will be denoted as E*.

Let us briefly recall the definition of the projective line over the ring E, which will be denoted by [formula], and several basic notions; see [\cite=BlHe2005], [\cite=Ha2012], and [\cite=He1995]. We start with E2, which is regarded as a left module over E in the usual way. Elements of E2 are written as rows. This module has the standard basis [formula], and so it is a free module of rank 2. All invertible 2  ×  2 matrices with entries in E constitute the general linear group [formula], which acts in a natural way on the elements of E2 from the right hand side. Now [formula], whose elements will be called points, is defined as the orbit of the cyclic submodule [formula] (the "starter point") under the action of the group [formula] on E2. Therefore, any point of [formula] can be written in the form E(α,β), where the pair (α,β)∈E2 is admissible, i.e., it is the first row of a matrix from [formula]. Furthermore, if (α',β') is any element of E2 then E(α',β') = E(α,β) holds precisely when there is an element γ∈E* such that (α',β') = (γα,γβ). In this case (α',β') is admissible too.

The projective line [formula] is endowed with a binary distant relation [formula] as follows: The relation [formula] is the orbit of the pair [formula] under the (componentwise) action of [formula]. Thus [formula] holds if, and only if, [formula].

The map

[formula]

is a bijection of [formula] onto the Grassmannian G2t,t,q of (t - 1)-subspaces of [formula]. Any two points of [formula] are distant if, and only if, their images under Ψ are disjoint (or, said differently, complementary) [\cite=Bl1999]. For versions of the previous results in terms of matrix rings we refer to [\cite=BlHe2005], [\cite=Ha2012], and [\cite=He1995]. See also [\cite=Wan1996], even though the terminology used there is quite different from ours.

Let φ denote a projectivity of [formula], i.e., φ is given by a matrix

[formula]

acting on E2. Then the mapping

[formula]

is a projective collineation. The action of [formula] on the Grassmannian G2t,t,q is given by Ψ- 1φΨ. By [\cite=Lang93], every projective collineation of [formula] can be written as in [\eqref=e:hat-phi] for some matrix from [formula].

Under any projectivity of [formula] the distant relation [formula] is preserved. The obvious counterpart of this observation is the fact that under any projective collineation of [formula] the complementarity of subspaces from G2t,t,q is preserved.

If [formula] then ρa∈E is defined by xρa = ax for all [formula]. The mapping is a monomorphism of rings taking [formula] to the identity [formula]. The image of this monomorphism will be denoted by F. We now consider [formula] as a subset of [formula] by identifying F(ρa,ρb) with E(ρa,ρb) for all [formula]. This allows us to embed the projective line [formula] in the projective line [formula] as follows:

[formula]

Following [\cite=BlHa2000a], the image of [formula] under any projectivity of [formula] is called an F-chain of [formula]. In particular, [formula] is an F-chain of [formula].

Any two distinct points of [formula] are distant precisely when they belong to a common F-chain [\cite=BlHa2000a]. From this we obtain the following result [\cite=Ha2012], which is a slightly modified version of [\cite=BlHa2000a]:

Given three distinct points P1,Q1,R1 on an F-chain C1 and three distinct points P2,Q2,R2 on an F-chain C2 there is at least one projectivity π of [formula] with Pπ1  =  P2, Qπ1 = Q2, Rπ1 = R2 and Cπ1 = C2.

Scattered points

For any point [formula] define:

[formula]

Also, we introduce the shorthand [formula], where h is as above. By the proof of Prop. [\ref=p:hans3] below, the point set L'T is the orbit of T under the group of all projectivities of [formula] that fix [formula] pointwise.

The following diagram describes the relationships involving some objects defined so far. (Note that the right hand side of [\eqref=e:B(T)] gives [formula].)

A scattered point of [formula] is a point T such that #  LT  =  θt - 1.

A point [formula] is scattered if, and only if, B(T) is a scattered linear set. For a point X = E(ρa,ρb) is distant from T if, and only if, the (t - 1)-subspace XΨ defined by the vector subspace 〈(a,b)〉qt is disjoint from TΨ.

If τ is a generator of [formula] and [formula], then B(T0) is a scattered linear set of pseudoregulus type [\cite=LuMaPoTr2014]. Hence T0 is a scattered point of [formula].

For [formula], the set LT will be said of pseudoregulus type when Lι- 1T is a linear set of pseudoregulus type.

Any two linear sets of pseudoregulus type are projectively equivalent [\cite=DoDu2014], [\cite=LuMaPoTr2014]. So LT is of pseudoregulus type if and only if [formula] where τ is a generator of [formula] and π is a projectivity of [formula].

The point [formula] with σ:u  ↦  uq, [formula], and [formula] is scattered [\cite=LuPo2001].

Let [formula]. Then Th = Tk for any [formula] such that [formula]. Furthermore, if T is scattered, then [formula] for any [formula] such that [formula].

If [formula] and T = E(α,β), then

[formula]

Let P' be the set of all points of [formula] belonging to the (t - 1)-subspaces of LT'Ψ. By the previous paragraph, it follows #  P'  ≤  θ2t - 1, and the equality holds if, and only if, for any h,k the relation [formula] implies [formula].

Let P be the set of all points of [formula] belonging to the (t - 1)-subspaces in LΨT. Then P  ⊆  P'.

If T is scattered, then #  P  =  θ2t - 1.

Let [formula] be a scattered point of [formula]. Then the following assertions hold:

A point [formula] belongs to LT if, and only if, a [formula] exists such that [formula];

the size of the set [formula] is θt - 1;

for any [formula], u and v are [formula]-linearly dependent if, and only if, uβ / u = vβ / v;

the dimension of ker β is at most one;

β is a singular endomorphism if, and only if, [formula].

Let P = E(ρa,ρb) be a point. Then P∈LT holds precisely when the (t - 1)-subspaces PΨ and TΨ are not disjoint; that is, there are two nonzero elements of [formula], say u and v, such that u = va and uβ = vb. This is equivalent to [formula] and uβ = a- 1bu. This implies (i), and consequently (v).

The size of I equals the size of LT, and this implies (ii).

If [formula] and [formula], then (ru)β / (ru) = uβ / u. This implies that the size of the image of the map [formula] is at most θt - 1, and the equality holds only if condition (iii) is satisfied. The last condition implies (iv).

Take notice that (i) and (v) hold irrespective of whether the point [formula] is scattered or not.

The following result is merely a reformulation of [\cite=LaShZa2015], with β∈E playing the role of the matrix A from there.

Let [formula] be a scattered point. The map

[formula]

is a projective embedding of the product space [formula] into [formula], that is, is an injective mapping such that the image of any line of the product space is a line of [formula].

In the case of non-scattered linear sets, the map ε is not an embedding, but the image of ε is still a non-injective projection of a Segre variety [\cite=LaZa201X].

In [\cite=Dy1991] a result similar to the following one is proved in terms of the matrix group [formula].

Let [formula] be a collineation of [formula] whose accompanying automorphism η is in [formula]. After embedding [formula] in [formula] according to [\eqref=e:embed], the collineation ι- 1κι of [formula] can be extended to at least one projectivity of [formula]. Conversely, the restriction to [formula] of any projectivity of [formula] that fixes [formula] as a set is a collineation with accompanying automorphism in [formula].

There is a matrix [formula] such that For all [formula] we have xaη  =  (xη- 1a)η and so ρaη  =  η- 1ρaη. The permutation of [formula] given by

[formula]

is a projectivity, since the automorphism of E acting on α and β is inner. By construction, this projectivity extends the collineation ι- 1κι of [formula].

Conversely, let π be a projectivity of [formula] that fixes [formula] as a set. Since [formula] acts (sharply) 3-transitively on [formula] there is a (unique) projectivity λ of [formula] such that the images of [formula], [formula], [formula] under ι- 1λι and π are the same. We choose matrices [formula] and [formula] that describe π and λ, respectively. Then (πij)  ·  (ρcij)- 1 induces a projectivity of [formula] that fixes each of the points [formula], [formula], [formula] and also the F-chain [formula]. So there is a δ∈E* with and for each [formula] there is a unique [formula] such that This leads us to δ- 1ρbδ  =  ρb' for all [formula]. Thus the inner automorphism of E given by δ restricts to an automorphism of the field F. Going back to [formula] shows that [formula] is an automorphism of [formula]. Furthermore, we read off [formula] from ρb being in the centre of E for all [formula].

Let [formula] and choose any [formula]. Calculating the image of d under δ- 1ρbδ  =  ρbη in two ways gives bδ  =  dbη, whence δ  =  ηρd. This leads us finally to

[formula]

We now repeat the first part of the proof with (dcij) instead of (mij). This gives the projectivity

[formula]

which obviously coincides with π.

The collineation κ from the previous proposition can be extended in precisely θt - 1 different ways to a projectivity of [formula]. Even though this could be derived easily from well known results about spreads [\cite=Knarr1995], we give a short direct proof.

There are precisely θt - 1 projectivities of [formula] that fix [formula] pointwise.

Let π be a projectivity of [formula] that fixes [formula] pointwise. We repeat the second part of the proof of Prop. [\ref=p:hans1] under this stronger assumption, while maintaining all notations from there. However, in our current setting we may choose [formula]. We are thus led to [formula] for some δ∈E*. This δ has to satisfy now δ- 1ρbδ  =  ρb for all [formula], which in turn gives that η is the trivial automorphism of [formula]. Letting d: = 1δ, as we did before, gives therefore that π is given by the matrix

Conversely, for all [formula] the matrix [formula] determines a projectivity of [formula] that fixes [formula] pointwise. Two matrices of this kind give rise to the same projectivity if, and only if, they differ by a factor [formula], where γ is an invertible element from the centre of E. This condition for γ is equivalent to γ  =  ρf with [formula], whence the assertion follows from [formula].

If [formula] stabilizes [formula], then LTπ = (LT)π and L'Tπ = (L'T)π for each [formula].

The first equation can be derived as follows:

[formula]

Let [formula]. Taking into account the structure of the projectivity π, described in ([\ref=e:struttura]), Tπh = (Thη- 1)π, whence L'Tπ = (L'T)π.

The investigation of scattered points can be restricted taking into account that if T is a scattered point of [formula], then there exist a projectivity π of [formula] and an element β∈E*, such that [formula], [formula], and [formula] (cf. [\cite=LuMaPoTr2014]).

Let s be the greatest element of [formula] that divides t. Then any two distinct F-chains of [formula] have at most qs + 1 common points.

Due to 3 = 21 + 1  ≤  qs + 1 it is enough to consider two distinct F-chains C1 and C2 with at least three distinct common points. By Prop. [\ref=p:0], we may assume these points to be [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula]. Applying Prop. [\ref=p:0] once more shows that there is a projectivity π of [formula] that fixes each of the points [formula], [formula], [formula] and takes C1 to C2. Consequently, there is a δ∈E* such that This gives The intersection [formula] is a proper subfield of F, since δ- 1Fδ is an isomorphic copy of F in E and C1  ≠  C2 implies F  ≠  δ- 1Fδ. This gives [formula].

Let T be a scattered point of [formula] and assume that t  ≥  3. Then LT is contained in no F-chain other than [formula].

From t  ≥  3 follows #  LT  =  θt - 1  >  qt - 1  +  1. The assertion is now immediate from Lemma [\ref=l:hans1].

For t = 2 the set LΨT is a regulus in [formula] and the F-chains are precisely the regular spreads in [formula]. Choose a point that is off the hyperbolic quadric H that carries LΨT. Then there are as many regular spreads through LΨT as there are external lines to H through the chosen point. A straightforward counting shows that the number of these lines is [formula]. Thus, unless q = 2, there is more than one F-chain through LT.

If κ is given as in (i) then, by the first part of Prop. [\ref=p:hans1], there is a projectivity of [formula] that takes B(T)ι = LT to B(U)ι = LU.

Conversely, let π be a projectivity of [formula] that takes LT to LU. There are two cases:

Case 1: t  ≥  3. From #  LT  =    #  LU the point U is scattered. By Prop. [\ref=p:hans2], each of the sets LT and LU is contained in no F-chain other than [formula]. Hence [formula] is invariant under π so that the second part of Prop. [\ref=p:hans1] shows the existence of a collineation of [formula] with the required properties.

Case 2: t = 2. The sets B(T) and B(U) are two linear sets of rank 2 and cardinality q + 1, i.e. two Baer sublines of [formula]. These are well known to be projectively equivalent.

If [formula] and t,q > 3, the sets LT0 and LT1, where T0 and T1 are defined in Examples [\ref=T_0] and [\ref=T_1], are not projectively equivalent in [formula].

The sets B(T0) and B(T1) are not projectively equivalent [\cite=LuMaPoTr2014]. Since any linear set in the [formula]-orbit of a linear set of pseudoregulus type is again of pseudoregulus type, B(T0) and B(T1) also are not equivalent up to collineations. Then the assertion follows from Thm. [\ref=t:preq].

Characterization of the linear sets of pseudoregulus type

[\cite=LaShZa2015] Let [formula] be such that LT is a set of pseudoregulus type. Then there is a [formula] such that LφT = LT'.

Since up to projectivities in [formula] there is a unique linear set of pseudoregulus type [\cite=DoDu2014] [\cite=LuMaPoTr2014], it may be assumed that [formula] with τ a generator of [formula]. A projectivity φ satisfying the thesis is given by the matrix [formula]. As a matter of fact, for any [formula],

[formula]

and by Prop. [\ref=p:varie] this implies that φ maps LT onto L'T.

The goal of this section is to prove the converse of Prop. [\ref=p:zero-converse].

Let ε:Π1  ×  Π2  →  Π3 be a projective embedding, where Πj is a projective space of finite dimension dj  ≥  1 for j = 1,2,3. Let U1 be the set of all d1-subspaces of type (Π1  ×  Q)ε for Q a point in Π2, and U2 the set of all d2-subspaces of type (P  ×  Π2)ε for P a point in Π1. Fix any point S∈Π2 and consider the subspace (Π1  ×  S)ε∈U1. Under these assumptions the following assertions hold:

A line y of Π3 is contained in some subspace belonging to U1 if, and only if, there is a d2-regulus Ry in Π3 subject to the following three conditions:

Ry has a transversal line in (Π1  ×  S)ε.

Ry is contained in U2.

y is a transversal line of Ry.

A subspace V of Π3 belongs to U1 if, and only if, V has dimension d1 and for any line y of V there is a d2-regulus Ry subject to the conditions (a), (b), and (c) from above.

Our reasoning will be based on the following three facts: (i) due to the injectivity of ε, each point in the image of ε is incident with a unique subspace from U1 and a unique subspace from U2; (ii) for any line [formula] the set

[formula]

is a d2-regulus; (iii) the transversal lines of this regulus are precisely the lines of the form [formula] with Q varying in Π2.

Ad 1. Let y be a line such that y  ⊂  (Π1  ×  R)ε∈U1, where R∈Π2. Since the restriction of ε to Π1  ×  R is a collineation onto the subspace (Π1  ×  R)ε, there is a unique line [formula] such that [formula]. By [\eqref=e:regulus], the d2-regulus [formula] satisfies (b). Furthermore, both y and [formula] are transversal lines of Ry, whence conditions (a) and (c) are satisfied too.

Conversely, assume that for a line y  ⊂  Π3 there is a regulus Ry satisfying the three conditions from above. By (a), there is a line [formula] for which [formula] is a transversal line of Ry. Now (b) implies that Ry can be written as in [\eqref=e:regulus] with [formula] to be replaced with [formula]. Thus (c) shows that there is a point R∈Π2 such that [formula]. This in turn gives y  ⊂  Π1  ×  R∈U1.

Ad 2. Let V∈U1. The dimension of V obviously is d1. Given any line y  ⊂  V there is a regulus Ry with the required properties by the first part of the proposition.

For a proof of the converse, we fix a point Y∈V and consider an arbitrary line y  ⊂  V through Y. By the first part of the proposition, there is at least one point R∈Π2 such that y  ⊂  (Π1  ×  R)ε∈U1. This implies Y = (X,R)ε for some point X∈Π1. The point R does not depend on the choice of the line y on Y. Consequently, V  ⊂  (Π1  ×  R)ε and, due to d1 being the dimension of V, these two subspaces are identical.

Clearly, analogous statements hold, where the roles of U1 and U2 are interchanged. We will refer to U1 and U2 in Prop. [\ref=p:caratt-massimali] as to the maximal subspaces of the embedded product space (Π1  ×  Π2)ε. Notice that such subspaces are defined with respect to the embedding, since (Π1  ×  Π2)ε may contain further maximal subspaces. Prop. [\ref=p:caratt-massimali] implies:

Let U1 and V be a collection of d1-subspaces and a d2-subspace in a projective space Π, respectively, where d1 and d2 are positive integers. There exists at most one collection U2 of d2-subspaces of Π with V∈U2, and such that U1 and U2 are the collections of maximal subspaces of an embedded product space.

By Prop. [\ref=p:caratt-massimali], a point [formula] is in L'T if, and only if, no line of PΨ is irregular as defined in [\cite=LaVdV2015] with respect to the scattered subspace TΨ.

Let [formula] be a scattered point, where β∈E*, let t  ≥  3 and suppose that there exists a projectivity [formula] such that LφT = L'T. Then LT is of pseudoregulus type.

We split the proof into four steps.

Step 1. First we fix some matrix [formula] that describes φ. Then we choose any point [formula] such that Uφ∈LT. The point Uφ is non-distant to all points of L'T, whence U is non-distant to all (namely θt - 1) points of LT. So U is scattered and LT = LU. Also, there is a γ∈E* satisfying According to [\eqref=e:hat-phi], the matrix (φij) describes also that projective collineation [formula] of [formula] whose action on the Grassmannian [formula] coincides with Ψ- 1φΨ. It can be deduced from Prop. [\ref=p:PGxPG-embed] that for any scattered point [formula], LΨX and (L'X)Ψ are the two collections of maximal subspaces of an embedded product space. So, a repeated application of Prop. [\ref=p:rekonstr-alt] implies:

LΨT is the unique collection of maximal subspaces of an embedded product space, containing UφΨ, the other collection being (L'T)Ψ.

(L'U)Ψ is the unique collection of maximal subspaces of an embedded product space, containing UΨ, the other one being LΨU = LΨT.

By applying [formula] to (b), one obtains:

(L'U)φΨ is the unique collection of maximal subspaces of an embedded product space, containing UφΨ, the other one being LφΨT = (L'T)Ψ.

By (a) and (c)

[formula]

Step 2. Let H be the subgroup [formula] formed by all matrices [formula] with [formula]. Also, let Λ be the associated group of projectivities of [formula]. Both [formula] and [formula] are cyclic. Now, for all [formula] the equality E(ρh,γρh) = E(ρk,γρk) holds precisely when h and k are [formula]-linearly dependent (cf. Prop. [\ref=p:Th]). Consequently we have shown: the cyclic group Λ acts regularly on L'U and fixes LU = LT pointwise.

Consider now the subgroup of [formula] and the corresponding group Λ': = φ- 1Λφ of projectivities. By the above, the group Λ' is cyclic, acts regularly on LT, and fixes L'T pointwise. From t  ≥  3 and Prop. [\ref=p:hans2] the F-chain [formula] is invariant under the action of Λ'. Since Λ' has order θt - 1, which is the size of the orbit LT, the group Λ' acts faithfully on [formula].

Step 3. Let us choose any element [formula]. The projectivity π given by the matrix fixes [formula], as a set. We therefore can repeat the second part of the proof of Prop. [\ref=p:hans1] up to [\eqref=e:mu_final]. By this formula, there exists an automorphism [formula] and an invertible matrix [formula] such that

[formula]

We claim that [formula]. In order to verify this assertion, we fix any element [formula]. The point E(ρu,ρuβ) is in LT, which is invariant under π∈Λ' by Step 2. This implies that there is a [formula] such that E(ρu,ρuβ)π  =  E(ρv,ρvβ). Furthermore, L'T is fixed pointwise under π. So, the associated projective collineation π̂ of [formula] sends for all [formula] the point to the point Therefore, for each [formula] there is an element [formula] such that As [formula] is also a vector space over [formula], this can be rewritten in the form Letting k: = 1 gives (uη,uβη)  ·  (cij)  =  x1(v,vβ) so that kηx1(v,vβ)  =  xkk(v,vβ). We thus have arrived at This means that each [formula] is an eigenvector of the [formula]-linear mapping η∈E. Thus η has a unique eigenvalue, i.e., xk / x1 is a constant that does not depend on k. Finally, 1η = 1 shows that this constant is equal to 1.

Step 4. We maintain all notions from the previous step (with [formula], under the additional assumption that h is a generator of the multiplicative group [formula]. There are three possibilities for the matrix [formula]:

First, assume that (cij) has a single eigenvalue in [formula]. Then, since (cij) cannot be a scalar multiple of the identity matrix, it is similar to a matrix of the form Due to [formula], the p-th power of this matrix is [formula], which gives that Λ' acts on [formula] as a cyclic permutation group of order p. Since LT is an orbit under this action, we obtain the contradiction #  LT  =  θt - 1  ≤  p.

Next, assume that (cij) has no eigenvalue in [formula], whence it has two distinct eigenvalues [formula] in [formula]. Here [formula] denotes the unique non-trivial automorphism in [formula]. So, over [formula], the matrix (cij) is similar to [formula]. Let w be a generator of the multiplicative group [formula]. We consider the matrix group [formula] of order q2t - 1. It acts as a group Ω of projectivities on [formula]. The kernel of this action comprises all matrices [formula] with [formula] or, equivalently, with [formula]. Hence we have The powers of [formula] constitute a matrix group and give rise to a subgroup of Ω. This subgroup is isomorphic to Λ', and therefore its order is θt - 1. This gives that θt - 1 divides qt + 1, which is impossible due to

By the above, (cij) has two distinct eigenvalues a,b in [formula] and so there is a matrix [formula] such that Let [formula] and let [formula] be the projectivity given by (μij). It fixes the F-chain [formula] as a set. We therefore obtain that Tμ is a scattered point and the equality LμT  =  LTμ (cf. Prop. [\ref=p:varie_1]). The group induces the cyclic group Λ'': = μ- 1Λ'μ of projectivities, which acts regularly on LμT and fixes the points [formula] and [formula]. So LμT contains none of these points, whence we have The matrix group generated by [formula] also induces the group Λ''. So the order of b / a in the multiplicative group [formula] is θt - 1. There is an element [formula] such that This allows us to give another group of matrices that induces Λ'', namely the group generated by

[formula]

where [formula] is given by x  ↦  xq.

Finally, let d: = 1δ. Then [formula] and, by writing the action of Λ'' in terms of the powers of the matrix from [\eqref=e:galois], we obtain Thus LμT is contained in LW, where This implies, due to #  LμT  =    #  LW, that LT is projectively equivalent to LW, which is of pseudoregulus type.

It should be noted that in Step 4 in the proof above the choice of a generator h of the multiplicative group [formula] serves the sole purpose that the projectivity related to the matrix (ρcij) is a generator of the group Λ' acting regularly on LT. Bearing this in mind, the following proposition can be extrapolated:

Let L be a scattered linear set of rank t in [formula]. If there exists a cyclic subgroup of [formula] acting regularly on L, then L is of pseudoregulus type.

On the other hand, any linear set of pseudoregulus type is projectively equivalent to [formula] [\cite=DoDu2014], [\cite=LuMaPoTr2014]. Hence the converse of Prop. [\ref=p:gruppo-transitivo] can be proved directly.
