Permutation-like Matrix Groups with a Maximal Cycle of Length Power of Two

Introduction

By [formula] we denote the complex general linear group of dimension (degree) d consisting of invertible d  ×  d complex matrices. Any subgroup G of [formula] is said to be a matrix group of dimension d. If there is a [formula] such that for every A∈G the conjugation T- 1AT is a permutation matrix, then we say that G is a permutation matrix group. If for any A∈G there is a [formula] such that T- 1AT is a permutation matrix, then G is called a permutation-like matrix group.

Cigler [\cite=C05] [\cite=C07] showed that a permutation-like matrix group is not a permutation matrix group in general. A d  ×  d matrix is called a maximal cycle if it is similar to a permutation matrix corresponding to the cycle permutation of length d. Cigler conjectured that:

Conjecture:  If a permutation-like matrix group contains a maximal cycle, then it is a permutation matrix group.

Let G be a permutation-like matrix group containing a maximal cycle which generates a normal cyclic subgroup. Cigler [\cite=C05] [\cite=C07] proved that if the dimension of G is a prime then G is a permutation matrix group. In [\cite=DF] [\cite=DF15], we further proved that the G is a permutation matrix group if the dimension is a square of a prime, or any power of an odd prime.

In this paper we prove:

Let G be a permutation-like matrix group of dimension 2n where n is any positive integer. If G contains a maximal cycle which generates a normal cyclic subgroup, then G is a permutation matrix group.

Necessary preparations for the proof of the theorem are made in Section [\ref=pre]. For fundamentals of the group theory, please refer to [\cite=AB] [\cite=R]. In Section [\ref=cyclic_case] we prove the theorem in the case when the quotient group of G over the cyclic subgroup generated by the maximal cycle is a cyclic group, see Theorem [\ref=cyclic] below. In Section [\ref=non-cyclic_case] we prove the theorem for the case when the quotient group is not cyclic, see Theorem [\ref=non-cyclic] below.

Preparations

We sketch necessary fundamentals from group theory, number theory and matrix theory, and formulate them in a way suitable to our later quotations.

The order of an element C of a group G is denoted by ordG(C), or ord(C) in short if the group is known from context. By 〈C〉 we denote the cyclic group generated by C. Assume that ord(C) = d. Then 〈C〉 is isomorphic to the additive group of the residue ring [formula] of the integer ring [formula] modulo d by mapping [formula] to Cj∈〈C〉. In this way, the properties of the cyclic group 〈C〉 are exactly corresponding to the properties of the additive group [formula], some of which are listed as follows.

〈Cr〉  =  〈C〉 if and only if [formula], where [formula] denotes the multiplicative group consisting of the reduced residue classes in [formula]; in that case Cr is said to be a generator of the cyclic group 〈C〉. automorphism α of 〈C〉 is corresponding to exactly one [formula] such that α(Cj) = Crj for any Cj∈〈C〉, and μr is an automorphism of the additive group [formula], where μr(j) = rj for any [formula]. 〈C〉 is normal in G, then G  /  CentG(〈C〉) is homomorphic to a subgroup of [formula], where CentG(〈C〉)  =  {A∈G|A- 1CA = C}, called the centralizer of 〈C〉 in G. If CentG(〈C〉)  ⊆  〈C〉, then 〈C〉 is said to be self-centralized in G.

In this paper we are concerned with the cyclic group of order 2n (with [formula] correspondingly). The next lemma has appeared in [\cite=DF15].

Assume that G  =  〈C〉 is a cyclic group of order |G| = 2n and 0  ≤  a < n. Let G2a  =  {C2at|0  ≤  t < 2n - a}. Then:

G2a  =  〈C2a〉 is a cyclic subgroup of G of order 2n - a generated by C2a.

The mapping Cj  ↦  C2aj is a homomorphism of G onto G2a with kernel G2n - a. Hence, for any generator G of the cyclic group G2a there are exactly 2a generators of G which are mapped to G.

By Φm(x) we denote the cyclotomic polynomial of degree m, i.e., [formula] with θ running over the primitive m-th roots of unity. Note that Lemma [\ref=2-cyclic] (ii) (with k = n - a) implies that

[formula]

where the subscript ω of [formula] runs over the primitive 2k-th roots of unity. In the specific case when k = 1, since - 1 is the unique primitive 2-th root of unity, we get a known formula: Φ2a + 1(x) = x2a + 1.

The structure of the multiplicative group [formula] is known (e.g., see [\cite=CDFL]). If n  ≥  3 then the following hold:

[formula] with [formula] and [formula].

[formula], and [formula].

[formula], and [formula].

In our study, the behaviors of the elements - 1, 1 + 2bv and - 1 + 2bv are quite different. But note that [formula] provided [formula] is even.

For the subgroups of [formula], we have the following result.

If H is a subgroup of the multiplicative group [formula] where n  ≥  3, then one of the following holds:

H is a cyclic group, and, if the order |H| = 2a, then 0  ≤  a  ≤  n - 2 and H  =  〈1 + 2n - a〉, or H  =  〈 - 1 + 2n - a〉, or H  =  〈 - 1〉 (hence a = 1).

H  =  〈 - 1〉  ×  〈1 + 2n - a〉 with 1  ≤  a  ≤  n - 2.

Proof.  By Remark [\ref=Z^*], we have a surjective homomorphism [formula] such that ρ( - 1) = 1, ρ(1 + 2bv) = 1 + 2bv and ρ( - 1 + 2bv) = 1 + 2b(2n - b - v). Then ρ(H) is a subgroup of 〈5〉, hence ρ(H) is a cyclic group of order 2a with 0  ≤  a  ≤  n - 2. If a = 0, then H = 1 or H  =  〈 - 1〉. Assume that a  ≥  1 in the following. Take a k∈H such that ρ(k) is a generator of ρ(H). Then [formula], and k = 1 + 2n - a or k =  - 1 + 2n - a. If [formula], then (i) holds. Otherwise, [formula], hence H  =  〈k〉  ×  〈 - 1〉; if k =  - 1 + 2n - a, we can replace k by - k. In a word, (ii) holds.

For any non-zero integer k, by ν2(k) we denote the 2-adic valuation of k, i.e., k = 2ν2(k)u for an odd integer u.

Let [formula] such that [formula] with 1  ≤  a  ≤  n - 2.

If r =  - 1, then a = 1 and [formula].

If r = 1 + 2n - av with v being odd, then

[formula]

If r =  - 1 + 2n - av with v being odd, then

[formula]

Proof.  (i) is obvious.

(ii).  Since ν2(2a - j) = ν2(j) for 0 < j < 2a, for the binomial coefficients [formula] we get that

[formula]

So

[formula]

(iii).  Noting that r - 1 = 2u with u being odd, by Eqn [\eqref=binom_coef] we obtain that

[formula]

where [formula].

Let G  =  〈A,C〉 be a finite group generated by A and C. If 〈C〉 is a self-centralized normal cyclic subgroup of order 2n and A- 1CA = Cr for an [formula] with [formula], then |G| = 2n + a and:

If [formula], then there is an A'∈G such that G  =  〈A',C〉 with A'- 1CA' = Cr and A'2a = 1.

If [formula] (hence a = 1), then one of the following two holds:

A2 = 1; in that case (ACk)2 = 1 for any Ck∈〈C〉 (i.e., G is the dihedral group of order 2n + 1).

A2 = C2n - 1; in that case (ACk)2 = C2n - 1 for any Ck∈〈C〉 (i.e., G is the generalized quaternion group of order 2n + 1).

Proof.  Since 〈C〉 is self-centralized, the quotient group [formula] is isomorphic to a cyclic subgroup 〈r〉 of the group [formula]. So [formula], |G| = 2n + a and A2a∈〈C〉. Let 〈C〉A  =  {Ct|A- 1CtA = Ct}, i.e., the centralizer in 〈C〉 of A. Then A2a∈〈C〉A. Since A- 1CtA = Ctr,

[formula]

Suppose that r =  - 1 + 2n - av where v is zero (i.e., r =  - 1) or odd. Since n - a  ≥  2, we have r - 1 =  - 2 + v2n - a = 2u with u being odd.

[formula]

Thus 〈C〉A  =  〈C2n - 1〉 which is a group of order 2 consisting of two elements {1,C2n - 1}. So

[formula]

In particular, if v = 0, i.e., r =  - 1, then we obtain the conclusion (ii).

Next, we assume that r =  - 1 + 2n - av with v being odd. Then A2a = 1 or A2a = C2n - 1. If A2a = 1 then we are done. Suppose that A2a = C2n - 1. Note that for any integer k and any positive integer j, by a direct computation we have the following formula:

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=1+r+](iii), [formula] with u being odd. We have an integer u' such that [formula]. Taking j = 2a and k = u' in Eqn [\eqref=(AC)^j], we obtain

[formula]

Replacing A by A' = ACu', we get that G  =  〈A',C〉, A'- 1CA' = Cr and A'2a = 1. So (i) holds.

Finally, assume that r = 1 + 2n - av with v being odd. Then

[formula]

By Eqn [\eqref=C^A], 〈C〉A  =  〈C2a〉; hence A2a∈〈C〉A  =  〈C2a〉. So, we can find an integer h such that A2aC2ah = 1. By Lemma [\ref=1+r+](ii) we can assume that [formula] with u being odd. We have an integer u' such that [formula], Taking j = 2a and k = u'h in Eqn [\eqref=(AC)^j], we obtain

[formula]

Replacing A by A' = ACu'h, we get the conclusion (i).

The next lemma shows that the condition "self-centralized" is usually satisfied in our study.

If G is a permutation-like matrix group and C∈G is a maximal cycle, then 〈C〉 is self-centralized in G.

There is also a proof of this lemma in [\cite=DF15].

For any complex matrix A, by charA(x) we denote the characteristic polynomial of A, i.e., charA(x) =  det (xI - A), where I denotes the identity matrix.

The following two are equivalent to each other:

A is similar to a permutation matrix.

A is diagonalizable and [formula].

If it is the case, then each factor [formula] of charA(x) corresponds to exactly one [formula]-cycle of the cycle decomposition of the permutation of the permutation matrix.

Note that [formula], where Φk(x) is the cyclotomic polynomial of degree k, and "k|n" stands for that k divides n. We get an immediate consequence of the above lemma as follows.

Let A be a matrix similar to a permutation matrix, and m,n be positive integers. If [formula], then [formula] for any k  |  n.

The quotient G  /  〈C〉 is cyclic

In this section we always assume:

[formula];

C is a maximal cycle;

A- 1CA = Cr, where [formula] and [formula] with 0  ≤  a  ≤  n - 2.

Let λ be a primitive 2n-th root of unity. Then

[formula]

is the spectrum (i.e., the set of eigenvalues) of C. The eigen-subspace of each eigenvalue λj of C, denoted by E(λj), has dimension 1; and the complex space [formula] is decomposed into a direct sum of the eigen-subspaces:

[formula]

Taking any non-zero vector ej∈E(λj) for every index [formula], we get a basis of [formula]:

[formula]

which will play a key role in our study. For convenience we denote the diagonal blocked matrix [formula] by [formula]. With the basis E in Eqn [\eqref=basis], the transformation C on [formula] has the diagonal matrix

[formula]

For the above, please see [\cite=DF15].

Consider the matrix A|E with respect to the basis E in Eqn [\eqref=basis]. Recall that A- 1CA = Cr where [formula] with [formula]. It is easy to see that

[formula]

i.e., A permutes the eigen-subspaces E(λj) for [formula] the same as μr permutes [formula], cf. [\cite=DF15]. For any μr-orbit [formula] on [formula] of length 2b (b  ≤  a of course), the subset [formula] of E is a basis of the subspace [formula]. And there are [formula] such that Aejk  =  α1erjk, Aerjk  =  α2er2jk, [formula], Aer2b - 1jk  =  α2bejk. That is, Vk is invariant by A, and the matrix of A with respect to the basis Ek is

[formula]

If ord(A) = 2a' (a'  ≥  a of course), then [formula] being a 2a' - b-th root of unity. Replacing Ek by

[formula]

we get

[formula]

In particular, A|Ek is a permutation matrix once a' = b (because ω2b = 1 once a' = b); in that case, A permutes the set Ek cyclically.

Similarly to 〈C〉, by 〈A,C〉 we denote the group generated by A and C.

Let notations be as above. If there is a choice of the basis E in Eqn [\eqref=basis] such that the matrix A|E is a permutation matrix, then the matrix group 〈A,C〉 is a permutation matrix group.

The statement "the matrix A|E is a permutation matrix" is equivalent to saying that "the set E is A-stable", i.e., A permutes the elements of the set E. In that case we call E an A-permutation basis. The rest of this section contributes mainly to finding such a basis E.

We partition [formula] into a disjoint union [formula], where

[formula]

Correspondingly, the basis E in Eqn [\eqref=basis] is partitioned into [formula] where [formula] and [formula]. And by Eqn [\eqref=eigen-subspace], [formula] is decomposed into a direct sum of two subspaces: [formula] where

[formula]

Both [formula] and [formula] are μr-invariant. So, for any k with 0  ≤  k < 2n, both V2 and V* are ACk-invariant subspaces of [formula]. By ACk|V2 and ACk|V* we denote the linear transformations of ACk restricted to V2 and V* respectively. Correspondingly, ACk|E2 and ACk|E* are matrices of ACk|V2 and ACk|V* respectively.

The two elements [formula] are always fixed by μr for any [formula]. So, the two eigen-subspaces E(λ0) = E(1) and E(λ2n - 1) = E( - 1) are always A-invariant subspaces.

(i).  Note that: if 〈A,C〉 is a permutation-like matrix group, then Ae0 = e0 for any e0∈E(λ0).  Because: in that case [formula] (since the traces of permutation matrices are non-negative integers, and the trace of I is 2n > 0), there is a vector [formula] such that [formula]; it is easy to see that Cf0 = f0 and Af0 = f0; hence f0∈E(λ0), and Ae0 = e0 for any e0∈E(λ0).

(ii). It is obvious that, if A|E is a permutation matrix, then Ae2n - 1 = e2n - 1.

Assume that [formula], C is a maximal cycle and A- 1CA = Cr where [formula] with [formula]. If A2a = I, then there is a choice of the basis E* of V* in Eqn [\eqref=V2V*] such that A|E* is a permutation matrix.

Proof.  Since [formula], the length of any μr-orbit on [formula] equals to 2a. Note that ord(A) = 2a. The conclusion follows from Eqn [\eqref=1-monomial_cycle].

The following lemma exhibits the information for the case when r =  - 1, which is enough for our later quotations.

Assume that [formula], C is a maximal cycle and A- 1CA = C- 1. If G  =  〈A,C〉 is a permutation-like matrix group, then A2 = I (i.e., G is a dihedral group of order 2n + 1) and one of the following two holds:

Ae2n - 1 = e2n - 1 for e2n - 1∈E(λ2n - 1), and

[formula]

In that case, there is a choice of the basis E in Eqn [\eqref=basis] such that A|E is a permutation matrix.

Ae2n - 1 =  - e2n - 1 for e2n - 1∈E(λ2n - 1), and

[formula]

Proof.  It is easy to see that [formula] is partitioned in to μ- 1-orbits as follows: Correspondingly, C is diagonally blocked as follows:

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=split], either A2 = I or A2 = C2n - 1. We prove that A2  ≠  C2n - 1 by contradiction. Suppose that A2 = C2n - 1, i.e., [formula] with

[formula]

By Eqn [\eqref=1-monomial_cycle], After a suitable choice of the basis E we can assume that

[formula]

and

[formula]

So, charA|E2(x) = (x - 1)(x  ∓  1)(x2 - 1)2n - 2 - 1 and charA|E*(x) = (x2 + 1)2n - 2. We get

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=permutable], the second factor of the right hand side has to be x + 1. Hence

[formula]

Then we get the matrix of AC as follows:

[formula]

and the characteristic polynomial as follows:

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=permutable], AC is not similar to a permutation matrix. However, the assumption of the lemma says that AC is similar to a permutation matrix. The contradiction forces that A2  ≠  C2n - 1.

Thus, we obtain that A2 = I and

[formula]

It is easy to check that:

[formula]  if [formula], then (i) holds;

[formula]  otherwise, [formula] and (ii) holds.

In the following we consider the case when [formula] and find a basis E in Eqn [\eqref=basis] such that A|E is a permutation matrix. We start it with an investigation of the characteristic polynomial of ACk.

Let [formula]. Assume that C is a maximal cycle, A- 1CA = Cr where [formula] with [formula], and A2a = I. Let V2 and V* be the subspaces in Eqn [\eqref=V2V*].

If r = 1 + 2n - av where 0  ≤  a  ≤  n - 2 and v is odd, then

[formula]

If r =  - 1 + 2n - av where 1  ≤  a  ≤  n - 2 and v is odd, then

[formula]

Proof.  By the assumption, [formula] is partitioned into μr-orbits Γ1, [formula], Γh with the lengths all being 2a and the number h = 2n - a - 1:

[formula]

By Eqn [\eqref=basis] and Eqn [\eqref=cycle_basis], we can assume that [formula] with

[formula]

Denote the matrices of A and C restricted to E*i by Ai = A|E*i and Ci = C|E*i for [formula]. Since A2ai = I, by Lemma [\ref=V^*] we have Thus [formula] and [formula] The conclusion is obviously true if k = 0. So we further assume that k  ≠  0.

Writing k = k'2ν2(k) with k' being odd, and writing [formula] with a' being odd and [formula], we have If a'' + ν2(k)  ≥  n, then λjia'k'2a'' + ν2(k) = 1. However, if a'' + ν2(k) < n, then λjia'k'2a'' + ν2(k) is a primitive 2n - a'' - ν2(k)-th root of unity, and, by Lemma [\ref=2-cyclic] (ii), the collection of

[formula]

is just the collection of all primitive 2n - a'' - ν2(k)-th roots of unity, each of which appears with multiplicity [formula] By Eqn [\eqref=cor_2-cyclic], we obtain that

If r = 1 + 2n - av where 0  ≤  a  ≤  n - 2 and v is odd, then, by Lemma [\ref=1+r+](ii), a'' = a; hence (i) is proved.

Next, assume that r =  - 1 + 2n - av where 1  ≤  a  ≤  n - 2 and v is odd. By Lemma [\ref=1+r+](iii), a'' = n - 1. So a'' + ν2(k) < n if and only if k is odd; in that case, n + a - a'' - ν2(k) = a + 1. Noting that Φ2a + 1(x) = x2a + 1, we are done for the conclusion (ii).

The second step is a preparation for induction. Let [formula]. Then μr (the action by multiplication) acts on both [formula] and [formula], and the map

[formula]

is an isomorphism between the μr-acted sets [formula] and [formula].

Let notation be as in Lemma [\ref=AC^k]. Assume further that the matrix group 〈A,C〉 is permutation-like. Then [formula] is a permutation-like matrix group of dimension 2n - 1 with C|V2 being a maximal cycle.

Proof.  Since [formula], with the isomorphism [\eqref=eq_2Z], C|V2 is a maximal cycle of length 2n - 1. Note that [formula] To complete the proof, it is enough to show that any [formula] is similar to a permutation matrix.

Let [formula], [formula] and [formula]. Then A'- 1CA' = Cr' and [formula]. We compute [formula] in two cases.

Case 1: r∈〈5〉 or [formula] (cf. Remark [\ref=Z^*]). We can use Lemma [\ref=AC^k](i) to A'Ck and get that Since [formula] is similar to a permutation matrix, by Lemma [\ref=permutable] and its corollary,

[formula]

Case 2: r =  - 1 + 2n - av with v being odd and [formula] (i.e. a' = a). By Lemma [\ref=AC^k](ii) (applied to A'Ck),

[formula]

Since [formula] is similar to a permutation matrix, by Lemma [\ref=permutable] and its corollary,

[formula]

In both cases, by Lemma [\ref=permutable] again, we can conclude that [formula] is similar to a permutation matrix.

Now we can get enough information for A|E when [formula]. We proceed in two cases: [formula], or [formula].

Let [formula]. Assume that C is a maximal cycle, A- 1CA = Cr where [formula] with [formula], and A2 = I. Assume further that 〈A,C〉 is a permutation-like matrix group.

If r = 1 + 2n - 1, then A|V2 = I.

If r =  - 1 + 2n - 1, then charA|V2(x) = (x - 1)2(x2 - 1)2n - 1 - 1.

In the both cases there is a choice of the basis E in Eqn [\eqref=basis] such that A|E is a permutation matrix.

Proof.  By Lemma [\ref=V^2], [formula] is a permutation-like matrix group of dimension 2n - 1 with C|V2 being a maximal cycle.

(i).  Obviously, r = 1 + 2n - 1 acts by multiplication on [formula] trivially. So, A|E2 is a diagonal matrix, hence A|E2 commutes with C|E2 which is a maximal cycle of dimension 2n - 1. By Lemma [\ref=self-centralized], [formula]. But (A|E2)2 = I and ord(C|E2) = 2n - 1. Thus A|E2 = I2n - 1  ×  2n - 1 or =  (C|E2)2n - 2. Suppose that A|E2  =  (C|E2)2n - 2, i.e., (A|E2)(C|E2)-  2n - 2 = I2n - 1  ×  2n - 1. Then

[formula]

However, ν2( - 2n - 2) = n - 2, and by Eqn [\eqref=r=5_V^2],

[formula]

We reached an impossible equality "(x - 1)2n - 1  =  (x2  -  1)2n - 2". So it is impossible that A|E2  =  (C|E2)2n - 2, and it has to be the case that A|E2 = I2n - 1  ×  2n - 1. By Lemma [\ref=V^*], we already have a basis E* of V* such that A|E* is a permutation matrix. Thus the basis E in Eqn [\eqref=basis] can be obtained such that A|E is a permutation matrix.

(ii).  Note that [formula] (cf. Eqn [\eqref=eq_2Z]), so

[formula]

From Lemma [\ref=V^2](ii) and its Eqn [\eqref=r=3_V^2], we have seen that [formula] is a permutation-like matrix group of dimension 2n - 1 with C|E2 being a maximal cycle, and

[formula]

Comparing it with Lemma [\ref=BC^k], we see that (A|V2)e2n - 1 = e2n - 1, and, with a suitable choice of the basis E2, A|E2 is a permutation matrix.

Assume thar [formula], C is a maximal cycle and A- 1CA = Cr where [formula] with [formula]. If a  ≥  2 and A2a = I, then there is a choice of the basis E in Eqn [\eqref=basis] such that A|E is a permutation matrix.

Proof.  We prove it by induction on n. By Remark [\ref=Z^*],

[formula]

From Lemma [\ref=V^*], we have a basis E* of V* in Eqn [\eqref=V2V*] such that A|E* is a permutation matrix. By Lemma [\ref=V^2], [formula] is a permutation-like matrix group of dimension 2n - 1 with C|V2 being a maximal cycle. Let A'    =    A2a  -  1. Then A'2 = I and A'- 1CA' = Cr2a - 1. Since 2a - 1 is even, we see that r2a  -  1 ∈ 〈5〉, hence r2a - 1 is the unique element of order 2 in 〈5〉, i.e., [formula]; see Remark [\ref=Z^*]. By Lemma [\ref=a=1](i), A'|V2 = I; i.e.,

[formula]

Note that [formula]. By induction, we have a basis E2 of V2 in Eqn [\eqref=V2V*] such that A|E2 is a permutation matrix. Then [formula] is a basis of [formula] in Eqn [\eqref=basis] such that A|E is a permutation matrix.

Assume that G is a 2n-dimensional permutation-like matrix group which contains a maximal cycle C such that 〈C〉 is normal in G and the quotient group G  /  〈C〉 is cyclic. Then G is a permutation matrix group.

Proof.  By the assumption we can assume that G  =  〈A,C〉 and A- 1CA = Cr for an [formula] with [formula] where 0  ≤  a  ≤  n - 2. By Lemma [\ref=self-centralized], 〈C〉 is self-centralized in G. By Lemma [\ref=split] and Lemma [\ref=BC^k], we can further assume that A2a = I and 1  ≤  a  ≤  n - 2. By Remark [\ref=Z^*], we prove the theorem in three cases.

Case 1:  r =  - 1, hence a = 1 and A2 = I. By Lemma [\ref=BC^k], Ae2n - 1  =    ±  e2n - 1. If Ae2n - 1 =  - e2n - 1, then we replace A by AC. So we can assume that Ae2n - 1 = e2n - 1. By Lemma [\ref=BC^k] (i), there is a basis E in Eqn [\eqref=basis] such that A|E is a permutation matrix. By Lemma [\ref=SC], G is a permutation matrix group.

Case 2:  r =   ±  1 + 2n - 1 (hence a = 1). By Lemma [\ref=split](ii), we can assume that A2 = I. By Lemma [\ref=a=1], there is a basis E in Eqn [\eqref=basis] such that A|E is a permutation matrix. By Lemma [\ref=SC], G is a permutation matrix group.

Case 3:  r =   ±  1 + 2n - av with v being odd and 2  ≤  a  ≤  n - 2. By Lemma [\ref=split](ii), we can assume that A2a = I. By Lemma [\ref=a_ge_2], there is a basis E in Eqn [\eqref=basis] such that A|E is a permutation matrix. By Lemma [\ref=SC], we are done.

The quotient G  /  〈C〉 is non-cyclic

In this section we consider any 2n-dimensional permutation-like matrix group G with a maximal cycle C such that 〈C〉 is normal in G and the quotient group G  /  〈C〉 is not cyclic, and prove that G is in fact a permutation matrix group.

It is easy to extend Lemma [\ref=SC] as follows.

Let [formula] with C being a maximal cycle and the subgroup 〈C〉 being normal in G  =  〈A,B,C〉. If there is a choice of the basis E in Eqn [\eqref=basis] such that both A|E and B|E are permutation matrices, then the matrix group G is a permutation matrix group.

Proof.  Let [formula] and [formula]. Because the matrix to transform the basis E to the set F is a Vandemond matrix formed by [formula] which is non-degenerate, F is a basis of [formula]. With respect to the basis F, C|F is obviously a permutation matrix. Since A permutes the elements of E, we have Af = f. For any Cjf∈F,

[formula]

Thus A|F is a permutation matrix. Similarly, B|F is a permutation matrix. So, with respect to the basis F every element of G is a permutation matrix.

Let [formula] where 1  ≤  a  ≤  n - 2. Then there are [formula] such that all the μr-orbits on [formula] are written as follows (note that bt = 1, 1  ≤  t  ≤  m, is allowed):

[formula]

Proof.  For [formula], [formula] if and only if [formula]. However, ν2(r + 1) = 1 since r + 1 = 2 + 2n - a and n - a  ≥  2. We see that [formula] if and only if [formula]. So, for any μr-orbit [formula] on [formula], the set [formula] is another μr-orbit on [formula], and

[formula]

Starting from any μr-orbit [formula] on [formula], we get a pair Γ1,μ- 1Γ1 of μr-orbits on [formula]. Taking any μr-orbit [formula] on [formula], we get another pair Γ2,μ- 1Γ2 on [formula]. Go on in this way till to [formula] exhausted, we obtain all the μr-orbits on [formula] as listed pairwise in the lemma.

Assume that G is a 2n-dimensional permutation-like matrix group which contains a maximal cycle C such that 〈C〉 is normal and the quotient group G  /  〈C〉 is not cyclic. Then G is a permutation matrix group.

Proof.  Since 〈C〉 is self-centralized in G (see Lemma [\ref=self-centralized]), G  /  〈C〉 is isomorphic to a subgroup H of the multiplicative group [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=sub_Z^*] (ii), H  =  〈r〉  ×  〈 - 1〉 where r = 1 + 2n - a with 1  ≤  a  ≤  n - 2. Then there are A,B∈G such that

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=split](i) and Lemma [\ref=BC^k], we further assume that A2a   =   I and B2   =   I.

First we show that there is a suitable choice of B such that AB = BA. Since the quotient group [formula] is commutative, in G  /  〈C〉 the image of B- 1AB coincides with the image of A itself. So there is a Ck∈〈C〉 such that B- 1AB = ACk. Note that ord(B- 1AB) = ord(A) = 2a, by Eqn [\eqref=(AC)^j],

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=1+r+](ii), [formula]. So the above equality implies that ν2(k)  ≥  n - a. We can write k = 2n - ah. Noting that r - 1 = 2n - a, we obtain:

[formula]

Replacing B with BCh, we still have G  =  〈A,B,C〉, B- 1CB = C- 1 and B2 = I (since (BCh)2 = I, see Lemma [\ref=split](ii.1)), and we have a further condition that AB = BA.

By Lemma [\ref=a=1](i) (for a = 1) and Lemma [\ref=a_ge_2] (for a > 1), there exists a basis E in Eqn [\eqref=basis] such that A|E is a permutation matrix. Specifically, Ae0 = e0 for any e0∈E(λ0) and Ae2n - 1 = e2n - 1 for any e2n - 1∈E(λ2n - 1), see Remark [\ref=e_0]. Using the notation in Lemma [\ref=r_and_-1] and the method in Eqn [\eqref=1-monomial_cycle], we construct the basis E precisely by choosing ej for [formula] as follows.

Let Γt and μ- 1Γt, for [formula], be the μr-orbits in Lemma [\ref=r_and_-1]. We take a non-zero vector ejt∈E(λjt). By Eqn [\eqref=1-monomial_cycle], [formula] is a basis of the subspace [formula] such that A|Et is a permutation matrix. Since Bejt∈E(λ- jt) (see Eqn [\eqref=permute_E]), we can take e- jt = Bejt. Then [formula] is a basis of the subspace [formula] such that A|E't is a permutation matrix. Let [formula]. Then E is a basis in Eqn [\eqref=basis] such that A|E is a permutation matrix.

On the other hand, Be- jt = B2ejt = ejt. i.e., B interchanges ejt and e- jt. Since B commutes with A, we get that B(Aejt) = A(Bejt) = Ae- jt. It is the same that BAe- jt = Aejt. So, B interchanges Aejt and Ae- jt. Similarly, B interchanges Aiejt and Aie- jt for [formula]. In a word, [formula] is a permutation matrix. Of course, Be0 = e0, see Remark [\ref=e_0]. To complete the proof, it is enough to show that Be2n  -  1  =  e2n  -  1; because: it implies that B|E is a permutation matrix, and by Lemma [\ref=SC_2], G is a permutation matrix group.

From an easy computation:

[formula]

we have (AB)- 1C(AB) = C- 1 + 2n - av with v =  - 1 being odd. Obviously, 〈AB,C〉 is a permutation-like matrix group and (AB)2a = A2aB2a = I (since AB = BA). By Lemma [\ref=a=1](ii) and Lemma [\ref=a_ge_2], there is a basis E' in Eqn [\eqref=basis] such that (AB)|E' is a permutation matrix. In particular, (AB)e2n - 1 = e2n - 1, see Remark [\ref=e_0]. Note that Ae2n - 1 = e2n - 1 implies that A- 1e2n - 1 = e2n - 1. Then Be2n - 1 = A- 1(ABe2n - 1) = A- 1e2n - 1 = e2n - 1. We are done.
