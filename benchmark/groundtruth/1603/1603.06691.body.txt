Higgs bundles and applications

Introduction

Higgs bundles were first studied by Nigel Hitchin in 1987, and appeared as solutions of Yang-Mills self-duality equations on a Riemann surface [\cite=LPS_N1]. Classically, a Higgs bundle on a compact Riemann surface Σ of genus g  ≥  2 is a pair (E,Φ) where E is a holomorphic vector bundle on Σ, and Φ, the Higgs field, is a holomorphic 1-form in [formula] for KΣ the cotangent bundle of Σ and End0(E) the traceless endomorphisms of E. Higgs bundles can also be defined for complex groups Gc, and through stability conditions, one can construct their moduli spaces MGc.

A natural way of studying the moduli space of Higgs bundles is through the Hitchin fibration, sending the class of a Higgs bundle (E,Φ) to the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial det (xI  -  Φ). The generic fibre is an abelian variety, which can be seen through line bundles on an algebraic curve S, the spectral curve associated to the Higgs field. The spectral data is then given by a line bundle on S satisfying certain conditions, and it provides a geometric description of the fibres of the Hitchin fibration. For instance in the case of classical Higgs bundles, the smooth fibres can be seen through spectral data as Jacobian varieties of S.

Higgs bundles and branes

The smooth locus of the moduli space MGc of Gc-Higgs bundles on a compact Riemann surface Σ for a a complex reductive Lie group Gc is a hyper-Kähler manifold, so there are natural complex structures I,J,K obeying the same relations as the imaginary quaternions (adopting the notation of [\cite=LPS_Kap]). Adopting the language of physicists, a Lagrangian submanifold of a symplectic manifold is called (the base of) an A-brane and a complex submanifold (the base of) a B-brane. A submanifold of a hyper-Kähler manifold may be of type A or B with respect to each of the complex or symplectic structures, and thus choosing a triple of structures one may speak of branes of type (B,B,B),(B,A,A),(A,B,A) and (A,A,B).

It is hence natural to construct different families of branes inside the moduli space MGc, as was first done in [\cite=LPS_Kap] (see also [\cite=LPS_Witten]). Together with D. Baraglia we introduced a naturally defined triple of commuting real structures i1,i2,i3 on MGc, and through the spectral data gave a detailed picture of their fixed point sets as different types of branes. Given (E,Φ) a Gc-Higgs bundle on Σ, consider pairs [formula], where [formula] denotes a [formula]-connection on E defining a holomorphic structure, and Φ is a section of Ω1,0(Σ,ad(E)), for ad(E) the adjoint bundle of E. Through the Cartan involution θ of a real form G of Gc one obtains

[formula]

Moreover, a real structure f:Σ  →  Σ on Σ induces an involution i2 given by

[formula]

Lastly, by looking at [formula], one obtains i3(A,Φ) = (f*σ(A),f*σ(Φ)). The fixed point sets of i1,i2,i3 are branes of type (B,A,A),(A,B,A) and (A,A,B) respectively. In [\cite=LPS_real], with D. Baraglia we studied these branes through the associated spectral data and described the topological invariants involved using KO, KR and equivariant K-theory. In particular, it was shown that amongst the fixed points of i1 are solutions to the Hitchin equations with holonomy in G.

Higgs bundles and (A,B,A)-branes

Amongst the fixed points of the involution i2 are representations of π1(Σ) that extend to certain 3-manifolds M whose boundary is Σ. Indeed, consider the space [formula] with involution τ(x,t)  =  (f(x), - t), for f the anti-holomorphic involution on Σ giving i2. The quotient [formula] is a 3-manifold with boundary ∂M  =  Σ, and satisfies the following:

Let (E,Φ) be a fixed point of i2 with simple holonomy. Then the associated connection extends over M as a flat connection if and only if the class [formula] in reduced equivariant K-theory is trivial.

Since Langlands duality can be seen in terms of Higgs bundles as a duality between the fibres of the Hitchin fibrations for MGc and MLGc, for LGc the Langlands dual group of Gc (as was first seen in [\cite=LPS_Tamas]), it is natural to ask what the duality between branes should be. In [\cite=LPS_real] we proposed the following:

For Lρ the compact structure of LGc, the support of the dual brane of the fixed point set of i2 is the fixed point set in MLGc of

[formula]

Higgs bundles and (B,A,A)-branes

Higgs bundles can be defined for complex Lie groups Gc, as well as for real forms G of Gc. Moreover, as seen in [\cite=LPS_Kap], the moduli spaces of real Higgs bundles MG lie as (B,A,A) branes inside the moduli spaces MGc. It is thus natural to ask how MG intersects the Hitchin fibration for the complex moduli space MGc, which is the main subject of [\cite=LPS_yoU] [\cite=LPS_thesis] (see also [\cite=LPS_spectral]). Moreover, considering Langlands duality, in [\cite=LPS_real] we propose the following:

The support of the dual brane to the fixed point set of i1 is the moduli space [formula] of [formula]-Higgs bundles for [formula] the so-called Nadler group, the group associated to the Lie algebra [formula] in [\cite=LPS_Nadler].

On (B,A,A)-branes having finite intersection with smooth fibres

In the case of Higgs bundles for a split real form G of a complex reductive Lie group Gc, from [\cite=LPS_thesis] one has the following description of the intersection:

The moduli space MG as sitting inside MGc is given by points of order two in the smooth fibres of the Hitchin fibration h:MGc  →  AGc.

This result is used in [\cite=LPS_monodromy] to study the moduli space of [formula]-Higgs bundles from a combinatorial point of view. The above theorem was also be used when studying L-twisted Higgs bundles (E,Φ) in [\cite=LPS_mono2], where the Higgs field is now twisted by any line bundle L obtaining [formula].

The monodromy action of an element s̃γ in the Hitchin base is the automorphism of [formula] induced by a Dehn twist of the spectral curve S around a loop lγ. Let [formula] be the Poincaré dual of the homology class of lγ. Then the monodromy of s̃γ acts on [formula] as a Picard-Lefschetz transformation: x  ↦  x  +  〈cγ,x〉cγ.

As an application of this theorem, one can obtain information about some real character varieties Rep(G). For instance, with D. Baraglia we prove in [\cite=LPS_mono2] that there are 3.22g + g - 3 connected components for [formula], and recover the number of components of maximal representations [formula], given by 3.22g + 2g - 4.

On (B,A,A)-branes having no intersection with smooth fibres

For other real forms the brane MG may lie inside the singular fibres of the Hitchin fibration for Gc-Higgs bundles. By extending the approach from [\cite=LPS_thesis] for Sp(2p,2p)-Higgs bundles, together with N. Hitchin we showed in [\cite=LPS_nonabelian] that this situation appears naturally when considering Higgs bundles corresponding to flat connections on Σ with holonomy in the real Lie groups [formula] and [formula] (i.e., SU*(2m) and SO*(2n)).

The fibres of the (B,A,A)-brane in the Hitchin fibration for [formula], [formula] and Sp(2m,2m)-Higgs bundles are not abelian varieties, but are instead moduli spaces of rank 2 bundles on a spectral curve, satisfying certain natural stability conditions.
