Affine transformations of the plane and their geometrical properties

Introduction

Let [formula] be the standard two-dimensional Euclidean space and φ be a reversible, non-isometric linear operator on this space. Let [formula] be the matrix of φ in the standard basis [formula], [formula] of [formula]. We will assume that operator φ is reversible, so [formula].

Let [formula] be the characteristic polynomial of operator φ. The roots λ1,λ2 of polynomial P could be either real numbers (real spectrum), or complex conjugate (complex spectrum). In the case of real spectrum we will assume that λ2  >  λ1 > 0. In the real case there are two one-dimensional invariant subspaces L1 and L2 in [formula], which consist of the eigenvectors with eigenvalues λ1 and λ2, respectively. In the complex case there are no non-trivial invariant subspaces.

Matrix A of operator φ satisfy the condition

[formula]

or

[formula]

in the complex case, and the condition

[formula]

in the real case.

Let φ be the operator with the real spectrum, λ1,λ2 are positive eigenvalues of the operator φ and β is the acute angle between the eigenvectors, then [formula].

In [\ref=s3:art2] we consider an operator φ with the complex spectrum and, using its polar decomposition, we obtain the following result:

Let φ be an operator with the complex spectrum, then [formula], where α is the rotation angle of the isometric operator and [formula] and [formula] are the eigenvalues of the positive self-conjugate operator in the polar decomposition of the operator φ.

In [\ref=s4:art2] we compute [formula] the mean value of the angle γ for the operators with the complex spectrum.

For the operators with the complex spectrum [formula].

In [\ref=s5:art2] we compute the norm of an operator φ and in [\ref=s6:art2] we study trajectories of the points under the action of an operator with the complex spectrum such that det (A) = 1. We prove that each trajectory belongs to some ellipse.

Other applications of polar decomposition can be seen in [\cite=4-art2].

The polar decomposition of the reversible linear operator on the plane

Let us note at first that if φ is an operator in [formula] with complex spectrum, then det (A) > 0, where [formula] is the matrix of φ in the standard base. Indeed, in this case the discriminant (a + d)2 - 4(ad - bc) of the characteristic polynomial of matrix A is negative.

In the real case we will assume that eigenvalues λ1 and λ2 of φ are positive. Here det (A) is also positive.

Now let us consider a self-conjugate operator [formula] ([formula]) and its (symmetric) matrix [formula]. It is well known that eigenvalues λ and μ of operator [formula] are positive and the corresponding eigenvectors [formula] and [formula] -- orthonormal. There exists operator [formula] such that [formula]. [formula] is a positive operator with the matrix B in the standard base and the matrix

[formula]

in base [formula] and [formula]. It must be noted that B is a symmetric matrix, because [formula] is a self-adjoint operator, and [formula].

The product A = (AB- 1)B = OB is called a polar decomposition of matrix A. Here the matrix O = AB- 1 is orthogonal. Indeed,

[formula]

Orthogonal matrix O defines an operator ψ, which is either a rotation, if det (O) > 0, or reflection, if det (O) < 0. If det (A) > 0 and [formula] is a positive operator, then O defines a rotation on angle α, thus

[formula]

If φ is an operator with complex spectrum, then, as we know, det (A) > 0. So, in this case also the orthogonal operator ψ in polar decomposition is a rotation.

Let [formula] be the matrix of operator φ in the base [formula] and [formula]. As [formula], then

[formula]

Condition [\eqref=eq2:art2] may be rewritten as

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

in the case of complex spectrum, and

[formula]

in the case of the real one.

Angles of rotations of the operator with the real spectrum

Let λ1 and λ2, 0 < λ1  <  λ2, be eigenvalues of φ and [formula] and [formula], [formula], be the corresponding eigenvectors. Let β be the acute angle between [formula] and [formula]. The plane is divided in four parts (cones) by two lines corresponding to the subspaces [formula] and [formula]. Each open cone is invariant under the action of φ and under this action each vector [formula] moves in the direction to the line L2. Let us compute the maximal value [formula] of the angle γ between the vectors [formula] and [formula] and estimate the angle γ.

Let φ be the operator with the real spectrum , λ1,λ2 are positive eigenvalues of the operator φ and β is the acute angle between the eigenvectors, then [formula].

We shall work in the base [formula]. Let x1 and x2 be the coordinates of vector [formula] in our base, then [formula]. As [formula] and Gram matrix of the vectors [formula] is [formula] then [formula].

[formula]

If we denote [formula] by t and [formula] by δ, then the formula [\eqref=eq7:art2] may be rewritten as

[formula]

To estimate the values of the function f(t) we calculate its derivative

[formula]

From [\eqref=eq9:art2] follows that the equation [formula] has three roots: t = 0, [formula] and [formula], hence [formula] for t∈(0, +   ∞  ), and [formula] for t∈( -   ∞  ,0). Notice that if [formula] then [formula] and hence

[formula]

Thus [formula].

If the base [formula] is orthonormal, thus cos β = 0, then from [\eqref=eq10:art2] follows that

[formula]

If λ1 < 0, λ2 < 0, then the operator φ is the composition of the operator with the real positive spectrum [formula] and the operator of the central symmetry and angle γ also can be estimated [formula].

If λ1 and λ2 are of different signs, then vectors [formula] and [formula] are in the adjacent cones and [formula].

Angles of rotations of the operator with the complex spectrum

Let

[formula]

be its matrix in the base [formula] (see [\ref=s1:art2]).

Here α is the rotation angle of the orthogonal operator ψ and λ and μ are eigenvalues of positive operator [formula]. As φ has no eigenvectors then it rotates each vector [formula] in one direction on some angle [formula]. If [formula] is the angle between vectors [formula] and [formula], then [formula]. It must be noted that angles [formula] may be positive and negative i. e. rotation from [formula] to [formula] may be counterclockwise or clockwise.

Let φ be the operator with the complex spectrum, then

[formula]

As [formula] is an operator with real positive spectrum and the base [formula] is orthonormal, then we can use the formula [\eqref=eq11:art2].

[formula]

Now from [\eqref=eq5:art2] we see that [formula], thus maximal rotation angle of φ is the sum [formula] and minimal rotation angle of φ is the difference [formula]. So [formula].

The mean value of the angle of rotation (complex case)

Let φ be an operator with the complex spectrum and [formula] be its matrix in the standard base. Then, as we know [\eqref=eq1:art2], a2 + 2ad + 4bc + d2 < 0. This condition defines a domain G in the four-dimensional real space with coordinates a,b,c,d.

In [\ref=s3:art2] it was proved that [formula] where γ is the angle between the vectors [formula] and [formula], α is the rotation angle of orthogonal operator ψ and [formula] is the maximal rotation angle of positive operator [formula] ([formula]). As λ and μ are eigenvalues of matrix [formula], then λ  +  μ  =  a2 + b2 + c2 + d2, λμ  =  (ad - bc)2. Set [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], then [formula], [formula] and the inequality x2  +  y2  -  z2  <  0 describes the domain G in new coordinates.

Also we have, that [formula]. Let [formula] be the mean value of the angle of rotation of the operators with the complex spectrum.

For the operators with the complex spectrum [formula].

As [formula], then, in order to estimate [formula], we have to calculate [formula] -- the mean value of the maximal rotation angle of operators [formula].

[formula]

Let us consider the domain [formula], where C  =  C1  ×  C2, C1  =  {(x,y);(x)2  +  (y)2  <  1} and, C2  =  {(z,t);(z)2 + (t)2 < 1}. As [formula] is a homogeneous function, we , instead of calculating [formula] by the formula [\eqref=eq14:art2], can use the following one:

[formula]

In order to simplify the integration we apply the polar coordinates x  =  ρ cos η, y = ρ sin η, t = r cos ξ, z = r sin ξ. [formula]. Now we can compute both integrals in formula [\eqref=eq15:art2].

[formula]

So from [\eqref=eq15:art2]-[\eqref=eq17:art2] it follows that [formula].

In order to get the sensible result for [formula] we have to limit the value of the angles α -- the angles of rotation of the operators ψ. Let α∈[0,π] then α can be uniquely determined by cos α. As similar matrices have the same trace, then [formula] or, after the change of variables, [formula]. As sin α  >  0 for α∈[0,π] then [formula], [formula] and, in order to compute [formula] -- the mean value of the angles α, we have to consider only part of the domain G corresponding to z > 0. As α  =  α(x,y,z,t) is the homogeneous function, we can use the domain [formula] with the condition z > 0.

[formula]

Thus we have the final result [formula].

The norm of the operator

Let now φ be an operator with the complex spectrum or an operator with the positive real spectrum, then [formula] be its matrix in the base [formula] (see [\ref=s1:art2]). The operator φ not only rotates the vector [formula] but also changes its length. If [formula] then [formula]. As an orthogonal operator ψ does not change the length of the vectors, then [formula]. So [formula]. It is easy to estimate all possible values of this ratio and to calculate the norm of an operator φ.

[formula]

If x1 = 0, then [formula], but if x2 = 0, then [formula], hence from [\eqref=eq18:art2] it follows that the norm of an operator φ is [formula].

Notice that if [formula] then an operator φ preserves the length of the vector [formula]. We can find vector [formula] satisfying this condition if and only if [formula].

Some curves related to the operator with the complex spectrum

Let φ be an operator with the complex spectrum, such that det (A) = 1. Thus its eigenvalues are complex conjugate numbers exp (iθ), exp ( - iθ) of modul 1.

Let Φ be the complexification of φ and [formula] be the eigenvector of Φ corresponding to the eigenvalue exp (iθ), then [formula], where [formula], [formula].

As [formula], then

[formula]

Now consider conjugate complex vector [formula]. [formula], hence [formula] is the eigenvector of Φ corresponding to the eigenvalue exp ( - iθ). The vectors [formula] and [formula] are linearly independent hence the vectors [formula] and [formula] are linearly independent too and can be taken as the base of the space [formula]. It follows from [\eqref=eq19:art2] and [\eqref=eq20:art2] that the matrix for the operator φ in the base [formula] is

[formula]

This matrix describes a rotation of the plane on an angle θ if and only if the basis [formula] is orthonormal, but for an operator with the complex spectrum it is not true in general.

Let us look at two co-ordinate systems on the plane. One of them has the x-axis and the y-axis corresponding the base [formula] and another co-ordinate system has the [formula]-axis and the [formula]-axis corresponding the base [formula]. Let [formula] and [formula] are coordinates of vector [formula] in the base [formula], then according to [\eqref=eq21:art2], coordinates of vector [formula] in this base, [formula] and [formula], satisfy the condition [formula].

It means, that under the action of φ, each point [formula] remains on a curve Γ

[formula]

Let [formula] be the change-of-basis matrix (from the base [formula] to the base [formula]), then

[formula]

Now we are able to get the equation of curve Γ in the Cartesian coordinate system. [formula] where [formula]. The curve Γ is the second-order curve and its quadric quantic is f(x,y)  =  (p2 + s2)x2  +  2(pq + st)xy  +  (q2 + t2)y2. [formula] is the matrix of this quadric quantic.

The three fundamental invariants Δ, δ and S determine a second-order curve up to a motion of the Euclidean plane: [formula], [formula], S  =  p2 + s2  +  q2 + t2.

As S > 0, δ  =  (p2 + s2)(q2 + t2)  -  (pq + st)2  =  (sq - pt)2  =   det 2(P) > 0 and Δ  =    -  δr2 < 0, then Γ is ellipse. The directions of major axis and minor axes coincide with the directions of the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues, [formula] of the matrix Af. So the canonical equation of an ellipse is [formula], where [formula], [formula] and irrespective of r all these ellipses are similar. Thus under the action of φ each point of the plane remains on the ellipse. The trajectory of the points is either finite number of points of ellipse if the angle θ is commensurable with π or the infinite dense set of points in the opposite case.
