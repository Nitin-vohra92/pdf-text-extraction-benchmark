Near field asymptotic behavior for the porous medium equation on the half-line

Introduction

This paper is concerned with the large time behavior of solutions to the porous medium equation (PME in what follows) in the half line,

[formula]

with m > 1, and nonnegative, and compactly supported integrable initial data. This problem, which models the flow of a fluid in a porous medium, has a unique weak solution; see [\cite=Vazquez-book]. The asymptotic behavior was first studied by Kamin and Vázquez in [\cite=Kamin-Vazquez-1991], and depends heavily on the fact that solutions to [\eqref=eq:main] preserve the first moment along the evolution, [formula] for all t > 0. Indeed, the behavior is given in terms of the so called dipole solution of the PME with first moment [formula],

[formula]

Note that this solution has a self-similar structure, and that, due to the choice of the similarity exponents α and β, its first moment is constant in time. The precise result in [\cite=Kamin-Vazquez-1991] states that

[formula]

In order for DM to be a weak solution of the equation on the half-line, with DM(0,t) = 0, the profile FM has to solve, in a weak sense,

[formula]

while the condition on the value of the first moment imposes

[formula]

A simple scaling argument shows that FM(ξ) = M1 / mF1(ξ / M(m - 1) / (2m)). It turns out that there is a unique bounded profile corresponding to M = 1, which is moreover explicit,

[formula]

with constants Cm and κm given by

[formula]

see [\cite=Barenblatt-Zeldovich-1957] [\cite=Gilding-Peletier-1976] [\cite=Gilding-Peletier-1977]. Note that F1 has a compact support,

[formula]

, with

[formula]

Let us remark that [formula]. In other words, the antisymmetric extension of DM, [formula], satisfies [formula], where δ' is the distributional derivative of the delta function. This is called in physics an elementary dipole. Hence the name dipole solution of the PME for DM.

Remarks. (a) The result in [\cite=Kamin-Vazquez-1991] states that solutions to the signed PME in the whole real line

[formula]

with an integrable and compactly supported initial data having zero mass and a nontrivial first moment [formula] converge to [formula], with an error which is o(t-  α). Solutions to [\eqref=eq:main] clearly fall within this framework, since they coincide with the restriction to the half line of the solution to [\eqref=eq:signed.PME] having as initial datum the antisymmetric extension of u0.

(b) The proof in [\cite=Kamin-Vazquez-1991] uses that [formula] is a solution to the p-laplacian evolution equation with p = m + 1,

[formula]

Convergence for u is deduced from the convergence of v and its derivatives. In particular, DM  =  ∂xB- 2M, where BK denotes the source type solution to [\eqref=eq:p.laplacian], that has Kδ as initial datum.

The limit [\eqref=eq:KV.result] gives the first nontrivial term in the asymptotic expansion of u for x = O(tβ), in the so called far field limit. However, since FM(0) = 0, in the near field, x = o(tβ), it only says that u is o(t-  α). The aim of this paper is to improve the result of Kamin and Vázquez in the near field, giving a sharp decay rate, which is faster than that in the far field, and a nontrivial asymptotic profile, which turns out to be a multiple of x1 / m. The precise result reads as follows. In particular, on compact sets, x∈[0,K], u is [formula], and [formula] converges to M2 / (m + 1)C1 / (m - 1)mx1 / m, while

[formula]

if g(t)  →    ∞  , g(t) = o(tβ).

We already know that the result is true in the far-field scale, ξ1  ≤  x / tβ  ≤  ξ2, 0 < ξ1  ≤  ξ2  <    ∞  ; see [\eqref=eq:KV.result]. If x  ≥  g(t)tβ, with g(t)  →    ∞   as t  →    ∞   (the very far field scale), formula [\eqref=eq:KV.result] yields a better result. Nevertheless, since DM(x,t) = 0 for x  ≥  ξMtβ, it only says that the solution is o(t-  α) there. However, by using some asymptotic formulas from [\cite=Esteban-Vazquez-1988], Kamin and Vázquez prove that s(t) =  sup {x:u(x,t) > 0} satisfies

[formula]

which gives a complete characterization of the asymptotic behavior for x > ξMtβ. Hence, it only remains to check what happens in the near-field. This is done through a matching argument with the outer behavior, which is based on a clever choice of sub and supersolutions. Comparison is performed in sets of the form 0 < x  <  δtβ, for some small δ. The ordering in the outer boundary comes from the outer behavior which was already known from the analysis in [\cite=Kamin-Vazquez-1991]. We devote Section [\ref=sect-supersolution] to obtain the upper limit and Section [\ref=sect-subsolution] to get the lower one.

A similar analysis for the linear heat equation has been recently performed in [\cite=CEQW2]. However, in that case linearity made things easier, since a representation formula for the solution in terms of the initial datum was available. That paper also considers a nonlocal version of the heat equation.

Control from above

The purpose of this section is to prove the upper" part of [\eqref=eq:main.result]. To this aim we will construct a supersolution V approaching DM with the right rate as t goes to infinity. We only need the function V to be a supersolution in sets of the form

[formula]

for T > 0 big and δ > 0 small. Our candidate is

[formula]

for some function k satisfying [formula] as t  →    ∞  . It will turn out that a good choice for k is given by the solution to

[formula]

Note that k(t) is well defined and that it is a monotone decreasing function of time.

We start by proving that V is a supersolution to the PME in Aδ,T if δ is small and T is big.

Let [formula]. Since mα + 2β  =  α + 1, a straightforward computation combined with [\eqref=eq:profile] shows that

[formula]

Thus, if we choose k satisfying [\eqref=eq:k], we get

[formula]

Now we observe that there is a value ∈(0,ξ1) such that F1'(ξ) > 0 for ξ∈(0,). Therefore,

[formula]

On the other hand, if we take   <  M(m - 1) / (2m) / 2, and then [formula], for any δ∈(0,) and [formula] we get

[formula]

Hence, - (FmM)''(ξ) - αFM(ξ) = βξFM'(ξ) > 0 if (x,t)∈Aδ,T, and the result follows, since k(t) > 1 for all times.

We now arrive at the matching part of the result where, using the behavior in the far field scale, we obtain an upper bound in sets of the form Aδ,T for δ small and T large.

Formula [\eqref=eq:KV.result] implies that for every ε > 0 there exists [formula], which may be assumed to be larger than [formula], such that

[formula]

For any given [formula] and some big enough k0 > 1 to be determined below, we define V by [\eqref=eq:V]-[\eqref=eq:k].

Since k(t) > 1, [\eqref=eq:positivity.derivative] implies that DM(x,t)  ≤  V(x,t) in [formula], and hence in Aδ,T. Therefore,

[formula]

On the other hand, for x = δtβ and t  ≥  T,

[formula]

and we conclude that

[formula]

Thus,

[formula]

Since solutions to [\eqref=eq:signed.PME] with integrable initial data are bounded for t  ≥  τ > 0, see [\cite=Vazquez-book], formula [\eqref=eq:KV.result] implies that there is a constant C0 > 0 such that u(x,t)  ≤  C0t-  α for [formula]. Thus, using the monotonicity property [\eqref=eq:positivity.derivative], we get

[formula]

if [formula]. Therefore, with that choice of k0,

[formula]

We now observe that W is a supersolution to the PME in Aδ,T. Indeed, in that set we have [formula], and hence Lemma [\ref=lem:control-from-above] implies that

[formula]

We finally notice that W(0,t) > 0 for all t > T. Therefore, comparison yields [\eqref=eq:upper.estimate].

The third ingredient, that we prove next, is that V and DM are ε-close in sets of the form Aδ,T for large times, even when the difference is multiplied by [formula], if the parameter a in the definition of V is O(εm).

There holds that

[formula]

In order to estimate I we notice that there exist constants ∈(0,) and K > 0 such that [formula] for ξ∈(0,). Thus, if we take   <  M(m - 1) / (2m) / 2, and then T̂ = (1 / )1 / β, for any δ∈(0,) and T  ≥  T̂, we get

[formula]

Therefore,   <  ε / 2 if [formula].

As for the other term, we will use that

[formula]

see formula [\eqref=eq:profile]. Therefore, taking into account that a < 1, we obtain

[formula]

if [formula] for some [formula], since k(t)  →  1 as t  →    ∞  .

We finally arrive at the main result of this section, the upper limit.

Let u be the unique weak solution to [\eqref=eq:main], and DM be the unique dipole solution to the PME with first moment [formula]. If [formula] is the constant given by Lemma [\ref=lema-D-V], then, for all δ∈(0,),

[formula]

Given ε > 0, let [formula] as in Lemma [\ref=lem:control-from-above], and T̂ and [formula] as in Lemma [\ref=lema-D-V]. We take [formula] and [formula], and then k0 > 1 large so that the function V defined by [\eqref=eq:V]-[\eqref=eq:k] satisfies [\eqref=eq:upper.estimate] and [\eqref=eq:epsilon.approximate] for any given δ∈(0,) for some large [formula].

On the other hand, since [formula] as t  →    ∞   and a∈(0,1), using [\eqref=eq:estimate.profile.above] we get

[formula]

for all large enough times.

Combining all the estimates mentioned above we finally get, for 0 < x < δtβ and all large enough times,

[formula]

Control from below

We will now deal with the lower" part of [\eqref=eq:main.result]. The proof is quite similar to that of the upper" part. However, in this case, subsolutions are only obtained in sets of the form

[formula]

and the points x∈(0,a) have to be treated separately.

The subsolution approaching DM with the right rate as t goes to infinity will have the form

[formula]

where c is the solution to the Initial Value Problem

[formula]

The function c is well defined for t  ≥  T. It is monotone increasing and [formula] as t  →    ∞  , as desired.

We start by proving that v is a subsolution to the PME in Aa,δ,T if δ is small and T is big, no matter the value of a∈(0,1).

Let [formula]. A computation analogous to the one we did in the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:supersolution] shows that

[formula]

But,

[formula]

and hence the result follows from [\eqref=eq:positivity.derivative], since c(t) < 1 for all times.

The matching with the outer behavior will require to know that u is positive in some set Aδ,T. This is what we prove next.

Since δ  <  ξM, the convergence result [\eqref=eq:KV.result] implies that there is a time tδ such that u(x,t)  ≥  K  t-  α for some K > 0 if [formula], t  ≥  tδ.

We now use that non-negative solutions to [\eqref=eq:main] have the so-called retention property: if u(x,) > 0, then u(x,t) > 0 for all t  ≥  . This can be proved in several ways, for instance, using that the application t  ↦  t1 / (m - 1)u(x,t) is non-decreasing. This monotonicity property follows easily from the estimate ut  ≥   - u / ((m - 1)t), which is proved using comparison arguments; see, for instance, [\cite=Vazquez-book]. Hence, u(x,t) > 0 for x∈((δ / 2)tβδ,δtβ), t  ≥  tδ.

It only remains to prove that u(x,Tδ) > 0 if x∈(0,(δ / 2)Tβδ) for some large enough Tδ  ≥  tδ, since the result will then follow from the retention property. The positivity in this fixed interval is achieved by comparison with a suitable translate of a source type solution of the PME,

[formula]

where the constant κm is as in [\eqref=eq:constants]. Such solutions are due to Zel'dovi[formula] and Kompaneets [\cite=Zeldovic-Kompaneec-1950] and Barenblatt [\cite=Barenblatt-1952]. Indeed, take [formula]. It is easy to check that if C > 0 is small enough, then

[formula]

Moreover, B(x - x0,t;C) is a solution to [\eqref=eq:main] until it touches the boundary x = 0. This will happen in a finite time Tδ  ≥  tδ. Then, comparison yields that u(x,t)  ≥  B(x - x0,t;C) for all t∈[tδ,Tδ], and hence the required positivity.

We now perform the matching with the outer behavior in order to obtain the control from below.

Let δ∈(0,) and a∈(0,1). Note that   <  ξM. The convergence result [\eqref=eq:KV.result] implies that, given ε > 0, there exists a value [formula] such that [\eqref=eq:outer.epsilon.approx] holds with [formula].

Let T  ≥  Tε,a,δ. We know from Lemma [\ref=lem:positivity] that there is a constant κ  =  κ(a,δ,T) such that u(x,T)  ≥  κ if a < x < δTβ. Take now c0∈(0,1) small so that c0T-  αFM(δ)  ≤  κ. With this choice of T and c0, we define v by [\eqref=eq:v]-[\eqref=eq:c]. Using the monotonicity property [\eqref=eq:positivity.derivative], we get

[formula]

On the other hand, since T  ≥  Tε,a,δ, the convergence result [\eqref=eq:KV.result] together with the selfsimilar form of DM, formula [\eqref=eq:selfsimilar.form.dipole] yield

[formula]

We notice now that c(t) < 1. Therefore, [\eqref=eq:positivity.derivative] implies that DM  ≥  v in Aδ,T, and we conclude that, for ε < FM(δ) and Cδ = 1 / FM(δ),

[formula]

We now observe that w is a subsolution to the PME in Aa,δ,T. Indeed, in that set we have [formula], and hence Lemma [\ref=lem:subsolution] implies that

[formula]

We finally notice that w(a,t) = 0 for all t > T. Therefore, a comparison argument allows to conclude that [\eqref=eq:bound-from-below] holds.

The next step is to control the difference between v and DM for large times.

Let x∈(a,δtβ) with δ  <  . Arguing as in the proof of Lemma [\ref=lema-D-V] we get

[formula]

if [formula].

On the other hand, using [\eqref=eq:estimate.profile.above],

[formula]

if [formula] for some large enough [formula], since [formula] as t  →    ∞  .

The combination of the above two estimates yields the result.

We now have all the tools we need to prove the lower limit. Here a difference arises with respect to the upper limit: we will have to treat separately the limit in sets of the form (0,a) with a small. This is done using that both u and DM are small in that set for large times.

Let u be the unique weak solution to [\eqref=eq:main], and DM be the unique dipole solution to the PME with first moment [formula]. If [formula] is the constant given by Lemma [\ref=lema-D-V], then, for all δ∈(0,),

[formula]

Given δ∈(0,) and ε∈(0,FM(δ)), we choose a small value [formula], with [formula] as in Lemma [\ref=lema-D-V]. We will precise how small it has to be later on. We take [formula], with [formula] as in Lemma [\ref=lem:control-from-above], and Tε,a,δ as in Lemma [\ref=lem:control-from-below], and then c0∈(0,1) small enough so that the function v defined by [\eqref=eq:v]-[\eqref=eq:c] satisfies [\eqref=eq:bound-from-below] and [\eqref=eq:difference.D.v].

By Lemma [\ref=lem:control-from-above], we know that there is a value [formula] such that the function V defined by [\eqref=eq:V]-[\eqref=eq:k] satisfies [\eqref=eq:upper.estimate]. Besides, since [formula] as t  →    ∞  , there exists a time [formula] such that k(t)  ≤  2 for all [formula]. Therefore, since Cδε < 1, using [\eqref=eq:estimate.profile.above] we get

[formula]

if a is small enough. On the other hand, using again [\eqref=eq:estimate.profile.above],

[formula]

We conclude that

[formula]

We now consider the set a < x < δtβ. Since [formula] as t  →    ∞  , using [\eqref=eq:estimate.profile.above] we get

[formula]

for all large enough times. Combining this estimate with [\eqref=eq:bound-from-below] and [\eqref=eq:difference.D.v], we finally get, for a < x < δtβ and all large enough times,

[formula]
