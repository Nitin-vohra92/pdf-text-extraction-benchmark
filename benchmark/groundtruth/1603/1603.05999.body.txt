Precise Near-Infrared Radial Velocities

Introduction

We are carrying out an exoplanet search to exploit the "M dwarf opportunity." Approximately 70% of main sequence stars are M dwarfs, spanning a factor of 5 in mass/radius and ~  103 in luminosity. Due to their smaller masses and radii and cooler temperatures compared to FGK stars, transiting exoplanets produced deeper eclipses of M dwarfs, exoplanet habitable zones are closer, and exoplanet radial velocity amplitude reflex motions are larger. More recently, a new "M dwarf opportunity" for finding exoplanets has been identified with the Kepler mission - not only are planets smaller than 4 [formula] more common than Jovian planets, they are predominantly found around lower mass stars (Howard et al. 2012, Dressing & Charbonneau 2013).

There are several factors spoiling the "M dwarf opportunity." First, M dwarfs are red and faint, with V - K > 3.5 mag and only 4 M4 or later dwarfs with V < 12 mag. Additionally, small planetary RV signals are comparable in amplitude and time-scale to numerous periodic perturbing stellar jitter signals such as rotational spot modulation & magnetic activity cycles (Vanderberg et al. 2015, Robertson et al. 2015). One solution to both of these challenges is to observe in the NIR, where M dwarfs put out much of their bolometric luminosity, and the amplitude of stellar jitter is diminished (Reiners et al. 2010, Plavchan et al. 2013a,b,2015, Anglada-Escude et al. 2012).

Results and Conclusions

We have obtained our goal precision of ~  30-60 m/s in our young M dwarf survey from 2010-2012, and ~  20-30 m/s in 2014 at higher SNR for nearby M dwarfs not previously surveyed by visible RV teams. We present a sample RV curve and our survey results in Figure 1. We are in the process of publishing our detailed survey results.

Looking towards the future, we have made the gas cells for iSHELL (R~  75,000, spectral grasp of 250 nm), which will replace CSHELL in 2016. We expect to get to <   5 m/s precision with iSHELL due to the increased spectral grasp alone (Figure 2). The increased efficiency, resolution, no fringing, and smaller number of bad pixels will provide further improvements.
