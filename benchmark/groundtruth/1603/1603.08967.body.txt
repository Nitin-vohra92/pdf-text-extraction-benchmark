Direct measurement of the electron energy relaxation dynamics in metallic wires

Energy relaxation of electrons in a conductor is a very important issue both on an applied and fundamental point of view. For example, the energy relaxation rate determines the bandwidth of hot electron bolometers used to detect electromagnetic radiation through heating of the electron gas [\cite=burke_mixing_1999]. Hence, we can distinguish between devices where relaxation processes are due to electron-phonon coupling (phonon cooled [\cite=kawamura_low_1997]) and devices where the electron gas cools down by out diffusion of hot electrons in reservoirs (diffusion cooled [\cite=skalare_large_1996]). In the former devices, the relevant inelastic time is the electron-phonon scattering time τe - ph while in the latter it is the diffusion time τD. On a fundamental point of view, inelastic times are key parameters for example for quantum correction to electron transport, electron localization at low temperature [\cite=Li_two_2012] and non-equilibrium effects [\cite=kawamura_low_1997]. Usual transport measurements such as conductance versus temperature fail to give access to the energy relaxation dynamics. At high temperature the conductance of a metal is usually determined by electron-phonon interaction, but τe - ph is so short that it is not accessible through transport and one has to use ultrafast optical methods to measure it [\cite=rogier_femtosecond_1995]. At low temperature in disordered conductors, the conductance is determined by the elastic mean free path, and independent of electron-phonon interactions. As a consequence, inelastic times are not determined directly. They are obtained as fitting parameters in measurements of weak localization corrections to conductance [\cite=santhanam_inelastic_1984] [\cite=pieper_measurement_1992] (in normal metals or superconductors above Tc) or in tunneling experiments which access the energy distribution function [\cite=Energy_pothier_1997]. A direct determination of inelastic times would provide a way to better test theories of quantum transport at low temperature. Beyond conductance measurements, noise, i.e. the variance of current fluctuations, is an interesting candidate to the measurement of inelastic dynamics. While noise is believed to be frequency independent up to frequencies related to charge screening [\cite=Nagaev_Long_1998], the effect of an ac excitation on the noise has been predicted to reveal inelastic times: first, Reulet and Prober [\cite=reulet_noise_2005] showed that the noise of a metallic wire should oscillate in time, the frequency dependence of the amplitude of that oscillation being a direct consequence of the energy relaxation dynamics. The present work is the experimental confirmation of this theoretical prediction. Second, the time-averaged noise (usually called photo-assisted noise) also presents a frequency dependence that depends on τD [\cite=Bagrets_Photon_2007] [\cite=frequency_bagrets_2007] or τe - ph [\cite=taskien_direct_2004]. In a conductor at equilibrium, the low frequency current noise spectral density is S2 = 4kBTG (in [formula]) where T is the electron temperature and G the electrical conductance. If the sample is driven out of equilibrium, for example by a dc voltage V0, the noise can still be expressed in terms of an equivalent noise temperature TN = S2 / (4kBG). The bias heats up the electrons by Joule effect, leading to an increased noise temperature. A small increase ΔPJ of the Joule power dissipated in the sample leads to an increased ΔTN with ΔPJ = GthΔTN where Gth is the thermal conductance between the electron gas and some thermal reservoir, for example the phonon bath [\cite=wellstood_hot_1994]. From this one can deduce the electron-phonon scattering time τe - ph = Ce / Gth provided the electronic heat capacity Ce is known [\cite=gershenson_millisecond_2001]. While Ce is known for some bulk materials, its value in thin, disordered films is not. In our experiment, the voltage bias contains an oscillating component: V(t) = V0  +  δV cos (2πft) with δV  ≪  V0. This induces an oscillating Joule heating power δPJ(f) at frequency f which modulates the noise temperature. From the complex (phase and amplitude) response δTN(f) we define the Noise Thermal Impedance, hereafter called NTI, R(f) = δTN(f) / δPJ(f). Its zero frequency value is simply R(0) = G- 1th. The frequency dependence of R(f) (and not its absolute value) is a direct probe of the electron energy relaxation rate Γ without any assumption about Ce. On the contrary, Ce can be determined by combining measurements of R(f) at low and high frequency. The frequency dependence of R(f) has been calculated for metallic wires in different regimes [\cite=reulet_noise_2005]. For long enough samples the energy relaxation of the electron gas is dominated by electron-phonon interactions. This occurs when L  ≫  Le - ph where Le - ph is the electron-phonon scattering length given by L2e - ph = Dτe - ph with D the diffusion coefficient. In this case the energy relaxation occurs in a time τe - ph and the NTI has the form:

[formula]

where Ge - ph is the thermal conductance between electrons and phonons. For shorter samples L  ≪  Le - ph electron-phonon processes are inefficient and the energy relaxation is dominated by diffusion of hot electrons into the contacts. Thus the time scale of energy relaxation is proportional to the diffusion time τD. The frequency dependence of R(f) for short samples has been calculated in [\cite=reulet_noise_2005] both with or without electron-electron interactions. It was found only a very slight difference between those two limits. We checked that the frequency dependence of R(f) is extremely well approximated by a Lorentzian decay with a characteristic frequency ≃10.01 / τD. As a result, both for L  ≫  Le - ph and L  ≪  Le - ph, we expect a NTI of the form:

[formula]

where Γ the energy relaxation rate depends on the relaxation process. In the presence of several relaxation processes, the fastest relaxation usually dominates. Since τe - ph is strongly temperature dependent and diverges at low temperature whereas τD is temperature independent, the energy relaxation is dominated by electron-phonon coupling at high temperature (τe - ph  ≪  τD) and diffusion at low temperature (τe - ph  ≫  τD). Our measurement allows continuous monitoring of Γ as a function of temperature. We have measured Γ(T) for six samples made of different metals (Al, Ag) and different geometries (the Al has been kept in its normal state with the help of a strong Neodymium permanent magnet). The wires have length L ranging from 5 [formula] to 300 [formula] long and have thickness d of 10 nm for the shortest and 20 nm for the others, see Table [\ref=table1]. The width has been adjusted to obtain a resistance R of the order of 50 Ω for impedance matching purpose. The contacts, made of the same metal as the wires, are much larger([formula]) and thicker (200 nm) to make sure they behave as electron reservoirs (for discussion on non perfect reservoirs see [\cite=henny_1/3_1999]). Samples from 5 μm to 25 μm have been made by e-beam lithography and the metal has been deposited by double angle evaporation [\cite=reese_niobium_2007] [\cite=dolan_offset_1977]. In this process we first evaporate the wire followed by the contacts without breaking the vacuum, thus preventing the growth of an oxide at their interface. Samples 1 and 2 have been made in two photo-lithography steps. A first one to make the wire and a second one for the contacts. The native oxide that develops on the wire between the two processes has been removed by ion milling before evaporating the contacts. The experimental setup is presented in Fig. [\ref=Fig.1]. The sample, placed at the 10 mK stage of a dilution refrigerator, is dc and ac biased through the low frequency port of a diplexer by a time dependent voltage V = V0  +  δV cos (2πft) with δV < V0. The dc part V0 is used to control the sample mean electron temperature through a constant Joule heating ΔPJ = GV20 and allowed us to work between ~  50 mK and ~  2 K. The superimposed ac power at frequency f, δPJ(t) = 2GV0δV cos (2πft) modulates the noise temperature of the sample. In the frequency band ΔF≃1.5 - 5 GHz (high frequency port of the diplexer) the voltage fluctuations generated by the sample are amplified by a cryogenic amplifier placed at the 3 K stage of the dilution refrigerator. Their rms amplitude is detected by a power meter (diode symbol in Fig. [\ref=Fig.1]) whose response time [formula] ns limits the maximum frequency at which the noise modulation can be detected, [formula] GHz. The detected power Pdet contains the noise generated by the sample and the amplifier. Its oscillation at frequency f, δPdet(f), detected with a vector network analyzer (VNA), is given by:

[formula]

where η is the response function of the detection chain (which frequency dependence is dominated by the response time of the power detector) and δPJ(f) the ac Joule power dissipated in the sample (note that due to imperfections and attenuation in the excitation line, the ac voltage across the sample is not known). Both need to be calibrated to extract R(f). In order to determine Γ(T), it is enough to know the frequency dependence of R(f), not its absolute value. Thus we consider the normalized R(f):

[formula]

At high temperature the frequency dependence of the NTI is given by the electron-phonon sacattering rate which increases with temperature (Γ(T) = τ- 1e - ph = A  ×  Tn with [formula]) [\cite=lawrence_calculation_1978]. Thus for T[formula] K the NTI is frequency independent below 1 GHz and the observed frequency dependence of δPdet(f) reflects only that of the setup, which allows the determination of Λ(f). Experiments have been performed at a phonon temperature of 10 mK. To make the link between the applied bias V0 and the electron temperature we first measured the noise of the sample at low frequency (1.5 GHz) at equilibrium (no bias) as a function of the temperature T, as well as the noise at base temperature as a function of V0. From these two measurements we deduce the link between applied voltage and electron temperature, i.e. how much voltage V0 is needed for the sample to generate as much noise as when it is at equilibrium at temperature T. We verified that even on the shortest sample, heating by applying a dc voltage or by increasing the overall temperature of the dilution refrigerator leads to the same Γ(T). In Fig. [\ref=Fig.2], we present the normalized noise thermal impedance versus frequency for sample 2 for electron temperatures between 53 mK and 1.04 K. The symbols are the experimental data and the black dashed lines the fits according to Eq. ([\ref=NTI_bis]). The frequency dependence of R(f) is very well fitted by a Lorentzian, Γ(T) being the only fitting parameter. We have performed this experiment for all the samples of Table 1 and extracted Γ(T) on 5 orders of magnitude. We present in Fig. [\ref=Fig.3] the measured relaxation rates as a function of electron temperature for all the wires. At low temperature we observe a plateau, the relaxation rate does not depend on temperature. In this limit only diffusion cooling occurs, and [formula]. At high temperature the observed Tn dependency is characteristic of an electron-phonon cooling process [\cite=lawrence_calculation_1978]. In [\cite=huard_electron_2007] the dynamic has only been calculated in the electron-phonon cooling or diffusion cooling regimes and not during the crossover. We thus assume that the frequency dependence of R(f) follows a Lorentzian even during the crossover between the two regimes with a relaxation rate given by the sum of the relaxation rates of the two processes:

[formula]

Dashed lines in Fig. [\ref=Fig.3] are fits according to Eq. ([\ref=equg]). The parameters A, n and τD extracted from the fits are summarized in table [\ref=table1]. The plateau observed in Γ(T) at low temperature, see Fig. [\ref=Fig.3], provides a direct determination of the diffusion time τD as a function of sample length. We expect τD = L2 / DE where DE is the energy diffusion coefficient, since our experiment probes energy relaxation. On the other hand the Einstein relation σ  =  κe2Dq relates the conductivity σ to the charge diffusion coefficient Dq, with κ the electronic compressibility, which reduces to the density of state at Fermi energy n(EF) for non interacting electrons. At low temperature, since diffusion is the only way energy can be relaxed, one expects Dq = DE = D according to the Wiedemann-Franz law. Thus, taking n(EF) in the free electron approximation, one deduces D from the conductivity. Accordingly, we plot the product DτD vs. L on the inset of Fig. [\ref=Fig.4] for all the samples. One clearly observes DτD = L2 (solid line) except for the longest Al wire . At high temperature the relaxation is dominated by electron-phonon interaction, and Γ(T) = ATn. We find n≃3 (see Table [\ref=table1]), the expected value for three dimensional phonon bath in the clean metallic limit [\cite=lawrence_calculation_1978] [\cite=santhanam_inelastic_1984]. In previous experiments, τ- 1e - ph has been reported to behave as Tn with n ranging from 2 to 4 depending on the nature of the disorder [\cite=sergeev_electron_2000] [\cite=bergmann_nonequilibrium_1990] [\cite=bergmann_inelastic_1982] [\cite=peters_1985] [\cite=echternach_electron_1992] [\cite=gershenson_millisecond_2001] [\cite=roukes_hot_1985]. Disordered gold wires have been observed to behave as T2.9 below 1K [\cite=echternach_electron_1992]. As far as we know, eletron-phonon relaxation rates of Al and Ag have not been measured below 1K, a temperature range hardly explored [\cite=echternach_electron_1992] [\cite=gershenson_millisecond_2001] [\cite=roukes_hot_1985]. While the frequency dependence of the ratio R(f) / R(0) provides a calibration-free method to determine the energy relaxation rate of the electrons, the measurement of R(f) with absolute units contains more information. At low frequency, R(0) = dTN / dPJ is deduced from the voltage dependence of the noise temperature TN. In the phonon cooled regime R(0) = G- 1e - ph. Combining this measurement with that of the scattering time τe - ph one can determine the electronic heat capacity Ce = Ge - phτep - h. We show on Fig. [\ref=Fig.4] (red symbols) the heat capacity of sample 2 in which electron-phonon dominates above 0.3 K, see Fig. [\ref=Fig.3]. In the diffusion cooled regime the electronic heat capacity is determined by Ce = GthτD. Gth can be determined from R(0) (i.e., calibrated dc noise measurement) or from the electrical conductance G using the Wiedmann-Franz law. Green symbols on Fig. [\ref=Fig.4] show Ce in the diffusion cooled regime obtained by combining NTI and conductance measurements. We observe that these two limits coincide and are in good agreement with the free electron model (dashed line) [\cite=Ashcroft]. Note that for our shortest sample (sample 5) at 50 mK we have been able to detect an extremely small value of the heat capacity [formula] J.K- 1 which is orders of magnitude lower than what is done using usual thermodynamic techniques [\cite=garden_thermo_2009]. We have determined Ce(T) in two limits. A theory for the full temperature dependence of R(f) is required to extract Ce(T) in the whole temperature range. We have demonstrated a sub-kelvin direct measurement of inelastic times in wires made of simple metals, which provides the determination of the electron-phonon scattering time, the diffusion time and the electron heat capacity of the sample. Our approach is however extremely versatile, and of great interest to study interactions and electron diffusion in modern materials. The measurement of the relaxation rate as a function of temperature or magnetic field could give a strong insight into the electron-phonon mechanism in graphene [\cite=betz_supercollision_2012] and topological materials [\cite=spivak_magneto_2016]. The direct determination of the diffusion time would play a pivotal role in the study of transport in materials such as quasi-crystals or thin films with fractal geometry, for which a deviation from a quadratic scaling of τD with the length of the sample is expected [\cite=roche_fermi_1998] [\cite=sokolov_fractal_2011]. Finally, our technique will allow the measurement of the electron heat capacity where conventional techniques simply do not work, in particular in samples which do not exist in bulk (nanowires, disordered thin films, 2D electron gas in heterostructures with strongly correlated materials).
