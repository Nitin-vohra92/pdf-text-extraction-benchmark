TI tether rig for solving secular spinrate change problem of electric sail

Nomenclature

Introduction

The solar wind electric sail (E-sail) is a concept how to propel a spacecraft in the solar system using the natural solar wind (SW) [\citep=paper1] [\citep=RSIpaper]. The E-sail uses a number of thin metallic and centrifugally stretched tethers which are biased at high positive potential (Fig. [\ref=fig:Esail]). The biasing is effected by an onboard electron gun which continuously pumps out negative charge from the tethers.

The following secular spinrate change problem was, however, identified [\citep=paper14]. When an E-sail orbits around the sun with the sail inclined with respect to the SW, the orbital Coriolis effect causes a secular increase or decrease of the spinrate. Inclining the sail is necessary if one wants to produce transverse thrust perpendicular to the SW direction, which is usually the case. Specifically, if the sail is inclined so that it brakes the orbital motion and keeps the spacecraft spiralling towards the sun, the spinrate decreases, and if the sail is inclined in the opposite way so that the orbit is an outward moving spiral, the spinrate increases. The rate of spinrate increase or decrease obeys approximately the equation

[formula]

Here Ω is the angular frequency of the heliocentric orbit and α is the sail angle, i.e. the (positive) angle between the sail spin axis and the SW direction. For example if α is [formula] and the spacecraft is in a circular orbit at 1 au distance, the spinrate changes by 9 % in each week. To overcome the problem, various technical solutions were proposed and analysed, for example the use of ionic liquid field-effect electric propulsion (FEEP) thrusters [\citep=D462] [\citep=D463] [\citep=MarcuccioEtAl2009] or photonic blades [\citep=paper16] on the remote units.

In this paper we present a novel design concept (the TI tether rig) for the E-sail which overcomes the secular spinrate problem and yields a technically simple hardware. We also present a control algorithm and demonstrate by detailed numerical simulation that the algorithm is able to fly the E-sail in real SW with full capability to control the orientation of the spin plane and the spinrate. We also demonstrate that the algorithm is able to accomplish its task using a simple set of sensors (remote unit position imager and vector accelerometer) with realistic amount of measurement noise.

The structure of the paper is as follows. We show that electric auxtethers enable spinrate control, present the TI tether rig design, the control algorithm, the dynamical simulation model and the simulation results. The paper closes with summary and conclusions.

Electric auxtethers enable spinrate control

We consider an E-sail as in Fig. [\ref=fig:ElAux3D] where the auxiliary tethers (auxtethers) are metallic and can be biased at high voltage, similarly to the maintethers. A segment of an auxtether then generates E-sail thrust which is perpendicular to it. Our aim is then to show that if the auxtether voltages can be controlled independently from the maintether voltages, spinrate control becomes possible.

Figure [\ref=fig:ElAux2D]a again shows an E-sail inclined at angle α to the SW flow, but now viewed from the top, antiparallel to the y axis. Consider a maintether in the xz plane i.e. in the plane of Fig. [\ref=fig:ElAux2D]a. The maintether generates a thrust vector [formula] which is perpendicular to itself.

Figure [\ref=fig:ElAux2D]b shows the same maintether [formula] rotation later when it is parallel to y axis. Now, because the tether is perpendicular to the SW, its thrust vector [formula] is aligned with the SW. We decompose [formula] in spinplane component [formula] and spinplane normal component [formula]. The spinplane component [formula] brakes the tether's spinrate when it moves upstream and accelerates it [formula] rotation later, and the net effect vanishes.

Panel [\ref=fig:ElAux2D]c is the same as panel [\ref=fig:ElAux2D]b, but we have added a charged auxtether segment at the tip of the maintether. The thrust vector [formula] is now a vector sum of the maintether thrust and the auxtether thrust. The maintether thrust is still along the SW flow as it was in [\ref=fig:ElAux2D]b, but the auxtether's thrust contribution is perpendicular to the auxtether, i.e. perpendicular to the spin plane. As a result, [formula] is not aligned with the SW and the ratio Fs / Fn depends on the ratio of the auxtether thrust versus the maintether thrust. In particular, by modulating the auxtether and maintether voltages separately, the ratio Fs / Fn can be different when the maintether is parallel or antiparallel with the y axis. By having the same Fn but different Fs in the upstream and downstream portions of the maintether's rotation cycle, we can modify the sail's spin rate while keeping its orientation fixed. Separate control of sail spinrate and spinplane orientation becomes possible because one has two control parameters in each angular segment, namely maintether voltage and auxtether voltage.

TI tether rig

To enable separate control of auxtether and maintether voltages, one could use various technical means, for example, each remote unit could carry a potentiometer or other means of regulating the auxtether voltage between zero and the maintether voltage. However, we propose a simpler arrangement where the remote units need no active parts. We propose that even-numbered maintethers are such that their remote unit is galvanically connected with both the left-side and right-side auxtethers (Fig. [\ref=fig:schematic], blue), while odd-numbered maintethers are electrically insulated from the remote unit (Fig. [\ref=fig:schematic], red). We call the even-numbered tethers the T-tethers because of the T-shaped shape of the blue equipotential region, and odd-numbered tethers are correspondingly called I-tethers.

In a given angular sector of the sail, we can effectively increase (decrease) the auxtether voltages by setting T-tethers to higher (lower) voltage than I-tethers. The auxtethers are always at the same potential as their associated T-tether so that no potentiometers or other functional parts are needed on the remote units. Two types of remote units are needed: ones that provide galvanic connection between the maintether and the two auxtethers, and ones that provide an insulating connection between all three connecting tethers. As usual, the remote units contain reels of the auxtethers which are used during deployment phase. During propulsive flight, no functionality is required from the remote units. The units only have to continue to provide the mechanical and electrical connection which is of galvanic and insulating type of even and odd-numbered units, respectively. Because of the presence of T-tethers and I-tethers, we call the design as a whole the TI tether rig.

Control algorithm

The control algorithm consists of six throttling factors which are multiplied together at the end to yield the voltage throttling of each maintether. The six factors and their roles in the control algorithm are listed in Table [\ref=tab:factors].

Let [formula] be the remote unit's position vector relative to the spacecraft and [formula] is the corresponding unit vector. We denote the angular momentum of the tether rig by [formula] and the corresponding unit vector (spin axis vector) by [formula]. The controller computes instantaneous angular momentum [formula] approximately from imaged positions [formula] of the remote units and their velocities [formula] found by finite differencing with Δt = 2 s timestep. The angular momentum [formula] used by the control algorithm below is a time-averaged version of [formula] which is obtained by continuously solving the differential equation

[formula]

where [formula] s is timescale used in the time-averaging.

Factor f1

The first throttling factor is

[formula]

where [formula] is a greediness parameter for spinplane turning and [formula] is the goal spin axis orientation. The factor f1 is responsible for turning the spinplane when [formula]. It modulates the tether voltages so that the SW thrust applies a torque to the tether rig.

Factor f2

The second throttling factor f2 takes care of keeping the spinplane orientation constant. The second factor is

[formula]

where the 'spinplane keeper factor' K is

[formula]

and the auxiliary factor

[formula]

The algorithm works moderately well even if A = 0, but it works better if A has the value ([\ref=eq:A]). The denominator of K is the tether-perpendicular component of [formula]. If the tethers spin rapidly so that they move nearly in a plane without coning, K does not depend on tether phase angle. However, in a real sail some coning occurs. Then the K factor decreases and increases thrust on the upwind and downwind orientations of the spinning tether, respectively, to keep the total torque zero.

Factor f3

The third throttling factor f3 takes care of increasing or decreasing the spin rate. First we define the spinrate increase factor S by

[formula]

Here [formula] is the spinrate increase greediness factor and [formula] is the goal for the relative spinrate, i.e. the angular mometum magnitude relative to the initial angular momentum magnitude [formula]. The throttling factor is given by

[formula]

Here [formula] is the instantaneous velocity of the remote unit (relative to the spacecraft, similarly to [formula]) and [formula] is the maximum allowed amplitude of our sawtooth tether modulation. Plus sign is selected for T-tethers and minus sign for I-tethers. The function [formula] forces the first argument within given limits a and b, a  ≤  b. For any x, [formula] is defined by

[formula]

The controller algorithm as described up to now works, but it does not damp tether oscillations that are produced by SW variations and the spinplane manoeuvres. Neither does it set the E-sail thrust to a wanted value. The purpose of the remaining factors f4, f5 and f6 is to take care of these.

Factor f4

For the first damping related factor, f4, we measure the spin-axis aligned speed [formula] (sign convention: positive sunward) of the remote units relative to the spacecraft, averaged over the remote units. The measurement is done by finite differencing the imaged remote unit angular positions and the throttling factor is

[formula]

where [formula] is greediness factor for damping and [formula] is the average rotation speed of the remote units with respect to the spacecraft. The idea is that if the tether rig oscillates collectively along the spin axis so that the tether cone angle changes periodically, the oscillation is damped if voltages are slightly throttled down when the rig is moving in the direction of the SW.

Factor f5

The factor f4 reduces collective oscillation of the whole tether rig, but each tether can also oscillate individually like a guitar string between the spacecraft and the remote unit. For reducing these a bit faster oscillations we introduce throttling factor f5. We measure the instantaneous thrust force [formula] acting on the spacecraft body (at 20 s resolution) by an onboard vector accelerometer. Notice that [formula] is the force exerted on the spacecraft by the tethers which is usually not equal to the total E-sail force exerted on the whole tether rig, except as an average over a long enough time period. When [formula] increases significantly, we apply overall throttling f5 to tether voltages where

[formula]

Here [formula] s is a damping timescale parameter, [formula] is the maximum applied thrust reduction due to damping and F0 is the typical tether tension multiplied by the number of tethers [formula]. We set the typical tension equal to the tether tension in the initial state.

Factor f6

The final throttling factor f6 is used to settle the E-sail thrust to a wanted value [formula]. We estimate the E-sail thrust on the tether rig as

[formula]

where [formula] is the momentum of the tether rig relative to the spacecraft (determined by imaging and finite differencing the remote unit angular positions) and [formula], [formula] is the mass of the tether rig and the total mass, respectively. The first term is due to acceleration of the tether rig with respect to the spacecraft body and the second term is due to acceleration of the spacecraft with respect to an inertial frame of reference. The time average of the first term is obviously zero, but its instantaneous value is usually nonzero and it carries information about tether rig oscillations that we want to damp. The instantaneous thrust exerted on the whole system (spacecraft plus tether rig) is

[formula]

From the instantaneous [formula] we calculate a time-averaged version [formula] by keeping on solving the time-dependent differential equation

[formula]

where [formula] s is another damping timescale parameter. Finally the overall throttling factor f6 is calculated as

[formula]

where [formula] s is the timestep how often the damping algorithm is called, [formula] is the previous value of f6 and [formula] is f6's maximum allowed value. Equation ([\ref=eq:f6]) resembles solving a differential equation similar to ([\ref=eq:L]) and ([\ref=eq:Ftotave]), except that ([\ref=eq:f6]) also clamps the solution if it goes outside bounds [formula].

Combining the throttling factors

The total throttling factor is

[formula]

where the maximum is taken over the maintethers.

Factors f4, f5 and f6 are updated at [formula] s intervals while f1, f2 and f3 are updated with Δt = 2 s time resolution. The motivation for using slower updating of f4, f5 and f6 is only to save onboard computing power. The computing power requirement is low in any case, but as a matter of principle we want to avoid unnecessary onboard computing cycles.

Factors f4 and f5 make only small modifications to the total throttling factor f. Despite this, their ability to damp tether rig oscillations is profound.

The tether voltages are modulated by f. We assume in this paper that the E-sail force depends linearly on V so that we can achieve the wanted force throttling by simply modulation the voltages by f. This should be a rather good approximation (see equation 3 of [\citet=RSIpaper]). Were this assumption not made, the nonlinear relationship should be modelled or determined experimentally and then used during flight to map thrust modulation values f into voltage modulation values.

Simulation model

We use a dynamical simulator which was build for simulating dynamical behaviour of the E-sail tether rig [\citep=SimDoc1] [\citep=SimDoc2]. The simulator models the E-sail as a collection of point masses, rigid bodies and interaction forces between them. Also external forces and torques can be included. The core of the simulator solves the ordinary differential equations corresponding to Newton's laws for the collection the bodies. The solver is an eight order accurate adaptive Runge-Kutta solver adapted from [\citet=NumericalRecipes3]. The solver provides in practice fully accurate discretisation in time. The only essential approximation is replacing continuous tethers by chains of point masses connected by interaction forces that model their elasticity. The E-sail force is included in the model. Synthetic or satellite-measured SW data can be used as the source. Table [\ref=tab:simparams] summarises the main parameters of the simulation used in this paper.

The control algorithm needs only two types of sensors. Firstly, we need imaging sensors to detect the angular positions of the remote units with moderate angular [formula] resolution and 2 s temporal resolution. The angular resolution requirement corresponds to about 2200×  530 pixels, either in a single panoramic imager or several small imagers along the spacecraft's perimeter. Secondly, we need a vector accelerometer onboard the main spacecraft, for which we assume noise level of 1.5 [formula]. A low-noise low-noise accelerometer such as Colibrys SF-1500 has noise level five times smaller than this. The imager resolution and accelerometer noise level were found by numerical experimentation. The chosen values are optimal in the sense that smaller measurement error in sensors would not noticeably improve the fidelity of the control and its oscillation damping properties.

In Table [\ref=tab:controlparams] we summarise the parameters of the control algorithm, including its virtual sensors.

Simulation results

All simulations start from an initial state where the sail rotates perpendicular to the SW. Synthetic constant SW is used in first three runs. In the last run, real SW is used. In all runs the thrust is modulated by [formula] so that it starts off gradually from zero. This is done to avoid inducing tether oscillations as an initial transient: although the algorithm can damp such oscillations, damping would not occur immediately.

In Run 1 (Fig. [\ref=fig:run1]), the tilt angle goal (panel a) is zero until 12 h, then it is set to 45[formula] where it remains for 18 hours. The sail starts turning when the angle is set and reaches almost [formula] angle after 18 hours. Then the φ angle goal is changed from 90[formula] to -90[formula] so that the sail starts turning again, via zero to the opposite direction. At 48 h the α angle goal is returned back to zero. Thus, Run 1 exercises a back and forth swing of the tether rig. Spinrate regulation greediness parameter [formula] is set to zero in Run 1 so that we can observe the natural tendency of the spinrate to vary during the turning manoeuvre. The spinrate (Fig. [\ref=fig:run1], panel d) increases up to 25 % from the initial value when the sail reaches [formula] angle. The increase is due to conservation of the sun-directed angular momentum component Lz: [formula] must increase if L2x + L2y increases while Lz remains constant.

The thrust direction (Fig. [\ref=fig:run1], panel e) varies according to the spinplane orientation. The total thrust is somewhat smaller when the spinplane is actively turned, which is due to the fact some tethers are then throttled in voltage (Fig. [\ref=fig:run1], panel f).

In Run 2 (Fig. [\ref=fig:run2]), the goal α angle is put to [formula] throughout. The spinrate control greediness parameter [formula] is put to its normal value of 2.0. The spinrate goal is 110 % spin for the first 18 hours and is put to very large value after that. The controller turns the spinplane smoothly to [formula] which also increases the spinrate moderately because of Lz conservation. When the spinrate goal is put high, the spinrate starts to increase almost linearly, reaching 60 % increase at the end of the run which is 2.25 days since setting the spinrate goal high. As a byproduct of the spinrate increase part of the algorithm, the sail angle (Fig. [\ref=fig:run2], panel a) decreases slightly from [formula] to about [formula]. The reason is that the spinrate modification and tilt angle modification parts of the controller algorithm slightly compete with each other because both use the same tether voltages for actuation. We do not expect this competition to be a practical issue because usually (to compensate the secular trend) the wanted spinrate change is much slower than in Run 2. In any case, Run 2 shows that if needed for any reason, the spinrate can be increased in a matter of few days with the model sail.

Run 3 (Fig. [\ref=fig:run3]) is similar to Run 2, but now we demonstrate decreasing rather than increaseing of the spinrate. The spinrate goal is put to 40 % at 18 h. The spin slows down obediently. In this case the sail angle increases somewhat above the goal value [formula].

Finally, in Run 4 we simulate a typical use case of the E-sail. We set the sail angle α goal to [formula] and the spinrate goal at 100 %. In Run 4 we also use real SW data to drive the E-sail where t = 0 corresponds to epoch January 1, 2000, 00:00 UT. The used SW data comes from NASA/GSFCV's OMNI 1-minute resolution dataset through OMNIWeb (Fig. [\ref=fig:SW],[\citep=KingAndPapitashvili2005]).

Gaps in OMNI data were filled by the following simple algorithm (Fig. [\ref=fig:gaprm]). Let f(t) be the data which has a gap at t1  <  t  <  t2. Mirror the data before t1 to make a function f1(t) = f(2t1 - t). Now, function f1(t) fills the gap

[formula]

Summary and conclusions

We have presented a new E-sail design and its accompanying control algorithm and sensor set which satisfies the following requirements:

Control of tether voltages from the main spacecraft is the only actuation mechanism.

Capability to control the orientation of the spin plane and thereby the orientation of the E-sail thrust vector.

Delivery of the wanted amount of E-sail thrust.

Spinrate acceleration and deceleration capability. With typical parameters, the spinrate modification control authority is many times larger than what is needed to overcome the heliocentric orbit Coriolis effect.

Remote units have no functionality requirements after deployment.

Algorithmic automatic capability to damp tether oscillations.

Both maintethers and auxtethers are biased and thereby propulsive.

Only two sensors are needed: remote unit angular position detection by imaging and accelerometer.

Moderate resolution sufficies for the imaging sensors.

The accelerometer should have low noise ([formula]), but devices exist (e.g. Colibrys SF-1500) whose noise level is even five times less.

In the simulations of this paper we did not study deployment, but an obvious question is if the spinrate increase capability of the algorithm would be enough to deploy the sail in reasonable time. Based on our preliminary analysis, the answer seems to be yes, provided that deployment to a few hundred metre tether length is first achieved by some other means.

Another future work that could be performed with our simulation is systematic analysis of average and maximum tether tension. Although not reported here, we have already monitored tether tension in our simulations, and the version of the control algorithm presented in this paper (Table [\ref=tab:controlparams]) was arrived at partly by trial and error minimisation of the maximum tether tension when thrust was kept fixed.

We think that the TI tether rig is a significant step forward in E-sail design particularly because it enables full control of the angular momentum vector while not requiring any functionality from the remote units during flight. As a result, the secular spinrate problem originally identified by [\citet=paper14] gets solved in a simple way.
