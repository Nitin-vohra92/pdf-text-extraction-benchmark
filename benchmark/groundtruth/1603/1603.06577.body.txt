Constraints on Black Hole/Host Galaxy Co-evolution and Binary Stalling Using Pulsar Timing Arrays

Introduction

Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are beginning to place meaningful constraints on the gravitational wave background (GWB) in the nanoHz-μHz gravitational wave band. In particular, recent upper limits have cut into the range of predicted strengths of the GWB from supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries [\citep=EPTA+15] [\citep=nanograv+15] [\citep=ppta+15].

The characteristic strain spectrum of the GWB, hc(f), is the quadrature sum of individual sources emitting in a certain GW frequency band. The first predictions of the GWB signal in the PTA band were made primarily using semi-analytical dark matter halo simulations [\citep=jaffebacker] [\citep=wyitheloeb]. These have been updated with full cosmological simulations (i.e. the Millennium simulation [\citep=Sesana+09] [\citep=Ravi+12]). In recent years it has been recognized that the dominant source of emission in the PTA band may come from the [formula] binary population [\citep=sesana+08] and efforts to predict hc(f) have been based on various combinations of simulated and observed components of cosmological galaxy evolution. In fact, a number of the parameters that make up the astrophysical GWB are well-constrained by observation. Thus, the focus has turned toward modeling the GWB based on local observables [\citep=sesana13] [\citep=mcwilliams+14] [\citep=ravi+15]. Current work attempts to understand the effects that both under-efficient inspiral (binary "stalling") and super-efficient inspiral (i. e. binary coupling with the galaxy core environment through the PTA band) might have on hc(f) [\citep=sesana13CQG] [\citep=ravi+14] [\citep=huerta+15] [\citep=sampson+15]. Inspiral efficiency affects both the predicted amplitude and the spectral shape of the of GWB, but it is unclear how the effects described above map into galaxy evolution parameters.

In this work, we aim to provide an accessible "translation" of GW strain directly to the parameters contributing to the largest uncertainties in the GWB spectrum. Our base assumptions are 1) circular SMBH binaries, and 2) dominantly GW-driven inspiral through the nHz-μHz GW band (i. e. a single power-law GWB). Section [\ref=sec:model] lays out the mathematical preliminaries of galaxy evolution parameters that contribute to the strain spectrum. These parameters provide the basis for our construction of the astrophysical GWB. Section [\ref=sec:obscon] describes the state-of-the-art observational constraints on these parameters from the literature used in this work. Section [\ref=sec:results] presents how each astrophysical parameter effects the strain amplitude, specifically exploring a direct mapping to the [formula] relation. Finally, Sec. [\ref=sec:ptacon] explores an example use-case for the results of this paper.

Model Of PTA Strain Spectrum

The polarization and sky-averaged strain from one circular binary system is

[formula]

[\citep=thorne87], where Mc  =  (M1M2)3 / 5 / (M1  +  M2)1 / 5 is the chirp mass of the binary, Dc is the proper (co-moving) distance to the binary [\citep=petersmathews63]. fr is the frequency of the GWs emitted in the rest frame of the binary, where Earth-observed frequency f = fr / (1 + z) for a circular binary. In the absence of external influence from the galactic environment, the orbit of such a system changes due to the emission of gravitational radiation at a rate [\citep=petersmathews63]:

[formula]

As in [\citet=sesana+08], we construct the characteristic strain spectrum for binary SMBHs as

[formula]

where d4N is the number of binaries in a given redshift range dz, mass range dM, and mass ratio range dq, which are emitting in a given GW frequency range d( lnf). h2s is the polarization and sky-averaged strain from each binary in that range, Eq. [\ref=eq:hrms]. Note that we expand chirp mass here into mass, M, and mass ratio, q, with q  ≤  1: Mc  =  M(q3 / (1 + q))1 / 5. The contents of the triple integral encapsulate the total number of binaries in a given frequency interval which, due to the constraints of human lifetime and measurement capabilities, are predicted based on the evolutionary properties of the galaxies that host the relevant SMBHs:

[formula]

In this expression, d3n is the number density of binaries in a given redshift, mass, and mass ratio range (dz, dM, and dq, respectively). The resulting conversion takes the number of binaries per co-moving volume shell, dVc, and converts it to the number of binaries per earth-observed gravitational wave frequency bin, [formula]. This is done first by converting from co-moving volume shell to redshift, and then converting from redshift to Earth-observed time.

Given Eqs. [\ref=eq:hrms]-[\ref=eq:d4N], hc can be written as a power-law with dimensionless amplitude Ayr [\citep=jenet+06]:

[formula]

PTA constraints are often quoted as an upper limit on Ayr using this basic f- 2 / 3 model of the expected SMBH binary background. However, PTAs are most sensitive to the GW frequency close to [formula], where Tobs is the total observation time, which for current data sets is around ten years. The constraint on Ayr is extrapolated using a spectral model of f- 2 / 3. A super-efficient inspiral from environmental coupling could give rise to a different spectral shape of the GWB [\citep=sesana13CQG] [\citep=ravi+14] [\citep=huerta+15], which may include a "turn-over" frequency in the PTA band, where the binary evolution changes from being dominated by energy removal from environmental coupling to being dominated by gravitational radiation [\citep=sampson+15]. In this paper, we work within the single-power-law model, but as PTA limits continue to improve, the extrapolation to a meaningful limit on Ayr will become increasingly dependent on the assumed shape of the spectrum [\citep=nanograv+15].

Parameters of Galaxy Evolution

There are no current direct observational constraints on the demographics of supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries. This work follows the prescription used in [\citet=sesana13] and [\citet=ravi+15], where the galaxy merger rate is used as a proxy and each galaxy in a merger is populated with a central SMBH using the observed relationship between SMBHs and their host galaxies.

The number density of galaxy mergers

[formula]

is a combination of two functions: the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF), Φ(z,M), and the galaxy merger rate R(z,M,q).

The GSMF is an astronomical observable, and is typically parametrized in terms of a either a single or a double Schechter function:

[formula]

The galaxy merger rate is the redshift-dependent rate at which a galaxy of mass M is involved in a major merger ([formula]) with a second galaxy with mass qM:

[formula]

This is calculated by combining the galaxy pair fraction, fpair(z), and the merger timescale, τ(z,M). The galaxy pair fraction is an astronomical observable. The merger timescale, which approximates the dynamical friction timescale for a dynamically bound pair of galaxies, must be determined through simulations.

Once the number of galaxy mergers has been calculated in a given redshift, mass and mass ratio range, the mass of each black hole in the merger is calculated using SMBH-galaxy scaling relations that have been observed in the local Universe. Again, we use the prescription described in [\citet=sesana13] to calculate Mbulge for each galaxy assuming some fraction of the total mass is in the central bulge. This fraction, fbulge, depends on galaxy morphology and mass. The SMBH mass is then calculated using a relationship of the form:

[formula]

Additionally there is an intrinsic scatter, ε, associated with each measurement of this relation, which is the natural scatter of individual galaxies around the trend line shown above.

Combining Equations [\ref=eq:strain] - [\ref=eqn:MSig], this model gives a prediction for Ayr:

[formula]

Observational Constraints

[\citet=sesana13] presented the first systematic investigation of the GWB using the method described in Section [\ref=sec:model] and utilized the mean values of many different observations. This work seeks to update that investigation in a complimentary way to what was done in [\citet=ravi+15], which used fewer, but more complete observations and focused closely on the uncertainties in the galaxy merger rate as well as other uncertainties inherent to the specific observations used to determine the GSMF and the [formula] relation. This work attempts to find a balance between these two approaches, using multiple current and complete observations, while also attempting to parse which details are more relevant to Ayr predictions.

Galaxy Stellar Mass Function

The total GSMF is fairly well-constrained by observation out to z  =  1.5 [\citep=tomczak+14], however there is still debate about how the total GSMF is broken down by galaxy type (star-forming vs. quiescent). Quiescent galaxies dominate the GW radiation that PTAs are sensitive to because they host larger black holes than star-forming galaxies. Therefore, the break-down of galaxy type as a function of mass and redshift has a large impact on the overall signal. We do not assume any kind clustering effect on mergers, so a quiescent galaxy's likelihood of merging with another quiescent is only based on the fraction of quiescent galaxies in a given redshift, mass, and mass ratio range. [\citet=ravi+15] shows that while there is some possibility for contamination of colour-selected GSMFs, the overall effect on the amplitude of the GWB is negligible compared to other contributions.

In this paper, we use the GSMF measured by the CANDELS/ZFOURGE survey [\citep=tomczak+14], and the full UltraVISTA survey [\citep=ilbert+13] for z  >  0.2. The ZFOURGE survey provides the deepest GSMF measurements to date [\citep=tomczak+14], while the UltraVISTA survey covers a wide field and so they compliment each other well. These two surveys show consistent results with the updated GSMF from [\citet=muzzin+13] used by [\citet=ravi+15]. This paper uses the SDSS/GALEX observations of the local universe GSMF (z  <  0.2; [\citealt=moustakas+13]).

Galaxy Merger Rate & Timescale Between Mergers

The observed galaxy merger rate is a combination of the observed galaxy pair fraction fpair, and an analytically calculated merger timescale τ (Eqn. [\ref=eqn:GMRate]). The galaxy pair fraction, fpair is fairly well constrained in the local universe (z  ~  0.1), but it is less constrained with increasing redshift [\citep=keenan+14]. fpair is expected to peak and turn-over somewhere around z  ~  2 - 3 for the most massive galaxies, which we are interested in [\citep=conselice14]. In this paper, we use the galaxy pair fraction from the GAMA survey [\citep=robotham+14] and the combined value resulting from analysis of the RCS1, UKIDSS, and 2MASS surveys [\citep=keenan+14]. While these two papers agree on the pair fraction in the local universe (z  ~  0.1), they differ by a factor of two on the redshift dependence of the pair fraction, with [\citet=keenan+14] showing a lower value. Here we keep the values of fpair fixed out to z  =  3, and find that the values of fpair reached are approximately at both the high and low ends of predictions, respectively [\citep=conselice14]. While both [\citet=sesana13] and [\citet=ravi+15] use the fpair measurement from [\citet=xu+12], it is not used in this work because the authors of [\citet=robotham+14] note that a local pair fraction observation from [\citet=xu+12], which sets both the low fraction at z = 0 and the high slope of the redshift dependence of the presented fpair relation, has been shown to be unrealistic. The revised measurement of [\citet=xu+12] is shown to be consistent with [\citet=robotham+14].

For self-consistent comparisons, recent observations of the galaxy pair fraction use one of two formulas for τ [\citep=lotz+11] [\citep=kw08], which differ by a factor of two. The [\citet=kw08] timescale is a lower limit for the galaxy merger timescale because it is derived by a dark matter halo merger timescale from the Millennium Simulation. [\citet=lotz+11] calculates τ from a set of hydrodynamical simulations, which incorporates gas and dust into the galaxy merger, unlike [\citet=kw08]. [\citet=xu+12] combined the mass and redshift dependence from [\citet=kw08] with the results from [\citet=lotz+11] to give a description of the major-merger timescale for z  <  1 which is combined with the pair fractions described above to give two different galaxy merger rates used in this work. Since this paper is focused on the effects of observable galaxy evolution parameters on the GWB we do not investigate different formulations of tau. However, in [\citet=ravi+15] the removal of the mass and redshift dependence of τ was found to produce a slightly higher value for Ayr.

SMBH mass - Galaxy Bulge Mass Relation

In the past few years, there have been observations of a steeper relationship than previously observed for the correlation between bulge mass and the mass of the resident SMBH. The steeper values are largely due to the recent measurements of the high-mass end of Mbulge, which in turn house the most massive SMBHs that will contribute to the GW signal in the PTA band [\citep=scott+13] [\citep=kormendyho13] [\citep=mcconnellma13]. As we aim to predict the most realistic GWB signal as relevant to PTAs, in our simulation we thus only consider the [formula]-Mbulge relations that include these massive galaxy measurements. Figure [\ref=fig:mmbulge] shows a demonstration of how the parameters of Eq. [\ref=eqn:MSig] vary with the inclusion or exclusion of measurements at the high-mass end, and various other considerations. It is unclear whether a single power-law best describes this relationship over the full mass range [\citep=graham16], but it appears to be sufficient for the most massive systems, and so in this work we do not consider the broken power-law prescriptions in [\citet=scott+13]. Additionally, we note that the high mass relation in [\citet=scott+13] is almost identical to the relation in [\citet=kormendyho13].

Measurements of the [formula] relation also include ε, the "intrinsic scatter", which is the natural scatter of individual galaxies around the trend line described by α and β in Eqn. [\ref=eqn:MSig]. This parameter plays a critical role in Ayr predictions as a way accounting for the outliers in the distribution. The galaxies containing over-massive black holes will contribute more to the GW signal in the PTA band than most galaxies of similar mass and thus are a necessary inclusion into any prediction of Ayr.

Results

Combining all of the observational constraints from §[\ref=sec:obscon] into our model described in Eqn. [\ref=eqn:a^2], we calculate a range of predictions for Ayr. The inputs are allowed to vary within the reported observational errors for each combination of GSMF, fpair, and [formula] relation used in this paper. Each combination is run 500 times for a total of 4000 predictions of Ayr. Figure [\ref=fig:Ayr] shows a plot of this distribution for major-mergers, [formula], between galaxies with a stellar mass in the range [formula] and lying in a redshift range z  <  3. Additionally, we include the predictions from [\citet=sesana13] and [\citet=ravi+15], and find that all ranges on Ayr are similar. Fig [\ref=fig:Ayr] also indicates where recent PTA upper limits fall in respect to this model's predictions. The most recently published upper limit comes from 11 years of data taken by the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array [\citep=ppta+15], which quotes an upper limit on Ayr of [formula]. The North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) has released nine years of data which produce an upper limit of [formula] [\citep=nanograv+15], and the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) quoted an upper limit of Ayr of [formula] [\citep=EPTA+15]. PTA upper limits are typically shown to "rule out" some portion of the predicted range on Ayr. However, it is often unclear what that means in terms of limits on the input SMBH evolution parameters. We aim to provide clarity by determining how, and how much, each parameter effects the resulting prediction of Ayr.

As expected for each prediction, Ayr is dominated by binary sources with chirp masses larger then [formula] as seen in Figure [\ref=fig:McvsAyr], which shows how the cumulative contribution to Ayr from increasing chirp masses. Figures [\ref=fig:ZvsAyr_gsmf] & [\ref=fig:ZvsAyr_fpair] show that the majority of the signal is produced at [formula], also as expected, but there is a lot of variance at lower redshift, which is discussed further Section [\ref=sec:error]. Figure [\ref=fig:ZvsAyr_gsmf] shows the contribution from binaries at different redshifts for both GSMFs used in this paper. While the general trend is the same for each, the differences in them directly follow the way that each GSMF handles the abundance of massive early-type galaxies, specifically between 0.5  <  z  <  1.5.

At higher redshifts the amount of signal is dominated by the total number of binaries, which is set in part by fpair. The effect of different fpair on the redshift distribution of the contribution to Ayr is shown in Figure [\ref=fig:ZvsAyr_fpair]. While both values of fpair used in this paper have the same value at z  =  0, the redshift dependencies vary by a factor of two. However, as described in Section [\ref=subsec:gmr], the two values trace the upper and lower ends of predictions for fpair at high redshift. An interesting feature of Figure [\ref=fig:ZvsAyr_fpair] is that the higher slope fpair from [\citet=robotham+14] contributes less at lower redshifts than the the lower slope fpair from [\citet=keenan+14]. This trend is directly related to the number of binaries contributing to Ayr at higher redshifts.

Relative effects of GSMF, fpair, and [formula]

Each parameter in Eqn.[\ref=eqn:a^2] that has an observational constraint also has an associated error. These errors obviously effect the variance in the final strain spectrum prediction. In Fig. [\ref=fig:Table1], we show the 1 - σ range of predictions for Ayr given by each combination of observational parameters. The percentage contribution to the total error is broken down for each parameter in a given combination, and shown underneath the predicted range of Ayr. Below, we discuss the breakdown of the errors in individual observational parameters impact on the final range of Ayr.

Given that [formula], the parameters which affect the binary chirp mass should have substantial impact on the prediction of A2yr [\citep=sesana10CQG]. Accordingly, we find the [formula] relation sets the mean value for A2yr predictions, as can be seen by the breakdown in Figure [\ref=fig:Ayr]. This is the relation that provides the translation from galaxy population to BH mass and therefore sets the mean value of the Mc distribution. Section [\ref=sec:astrolimsmbulge] discusses in detail how the [formula] measurement parameters contribute to A2yr.

The GSMF plays a large role in determining the variance of a certain prediction. All mass functions used in this paper are parametrized using a double Schechter function (Eqn [\ref=eqn:gsmf]) for z  <  1.5, so there are a lot observed parameters included in each calculation. Looking at each Schechter parameter and the error bars associated with it reveals that uncertainty in [formula] has the largest effect A2yr predictions, contributing 45% of the GSMF error for both observations used in this paper. [formula] is the mass at which the Schechter function transitions between the high-mass exponential decay and the lower-mass slopes α1 and α2. The error from the local GSMF, z  <  0.2 [\citep=moustakas+13], is minimal at 2% of the GSMF error, but the next redshift bin, 0.2  <  z  <  0.5, in both GSMF observations used in this paper provides the largest influence by redshift on GSMF error contribution to A2yr at 55% for [\citet=tomczak+14] and 72% for [\citet=ilbert+13].

The host galaxy's mass is used to estimate each black hole's mass using fbulge. fbulge for quiescent galaxies is described with two values, one that sets the fraction of mass in the central bulge for massive galaxies, [formula], and one that sets the fraction of mass in the central bulge for galaxies with stellar masses of [formula]. Given the dominance of the signal from binaries with chirp masses above [formula], the effect of the quiescent galaxy's fbulge on Ayr was calculated. Fig. [\ref=fig:fbulge] demonstrates the dependence of Ayr on fbulge for quiescent galaxies, making it clear that there is not a strong dependence (less than a factor of [formula]).

The pair fraction, fpair, has the least impact on A2yr. Although the parameter itself has a large range, it only impacts the number of sources ([formula]), rather than the masses of those sources.

Translating GWB Limits and Astrophysical Parameters

The overarching goal of this paper is to provide a mapping of GWB limit/measurement values to specific parameters of galaxy formation. Below, we look at how areas of parameter space correspond to specific values of Ayr with an associated error range. In our discussions below we aim to make the following two statements attainable:

Given a PTA upper limit on the GWB, what specifically does this mean for galaxy/SMBH evolution?

Given a new observation of the [formula]-Mbulge relation, are the new values compatible with the best PTA limit? If not, how can they be reconciled?

GW limits and the Black Hole - Host Galaxy Relation

The parameter space that characterizes the black hole-host galaxy relation is encompassed by α, β, and ε. The last of these is the natural scatter of individual galaxies around the trend described by intercept α and slope β. This ε plays a critical role in Ayr predictions; as ε increases, higher masses are present in a few binaries, which increases the distribution of chirp masses and effectively weights Ayr upward. We demonstrate the implications of this in Figure [\ref=fig:hvse], which shows the dependence calculated numerically; for any combination of α and β, changes in ε effect A2yr in the same way.

In Fig. [\ref=fig:avsb], we show contours of constant Ayr in α-β space, while keeping ε equal to zero, as this is the most common way that the [formula] relation is reported. Yet, for a specific value of α, changing β across the entire range of observed values translates to only a < 20% change in Ayr. It is thus α and ε that have the most impact on a prediction of Ayr, and so we combine the results of Fig. [\ref=fig:hvse] & [\ref=fig:avsb] in Fig. [\ref=fig:avse] to show Ayr as a function of α and ε, while holding β = 1.

GW limits and Stalling Binaries

The assumption that galaxy mergers and binary black holes form at the same cosmological time has until now been implicit in the model used in this paper and others. Yet, as PTA upper limits become inconsistent with measured astronomical parameters, the assumptions of this model must be questioned. It is straight forward to ease this assumption by allowing for a "stall" in the binary SMBH formation. Let us introduce a variable, Tstall, which is a measure of the time between the galaxy merger, which occurs approximately on a dynamical friction timescale, and the binary SMBH entering the PTA band. This stalling timescale creates a redshift offset between the galaxy merger and binary SMBH's in-band GW emission. This is incorporated into Eqn. [\ref=eq:d4N] like so:

[formula]

where z1 is the redshift of the galaxy merger, and z2 is the redshift at which the binary is emitting in the PTA band, while Tstall is the proper time between z1 and z2. Fig. [\ref=fig:hvsTstall] shows how Ayr changes with different values of Tstall. Obviously as the stalling time scale reaches values nearing the Hubble time, Ayr falls to zero as no systems are expected to ever enter the PTA band. The meaning and use of limits on Tstall are described further in Section [\ref=sec:stall].

Limiting [formula] and stalling timescale with PTA constraints

The following section describes a method by which PTA constraints can be extended beyond Ayr and into the parameter space of galaxy evolution. Similar goals have been proposed using different methods in [\citet=middleton+16]. We note that a key difference between this work and that of [\citet=middleton+16] is that we interpret PTA limits in the context of other observational constraints on galaxy evolution, whereas the [\citet=middleton+16] method assumes no outside knowledge of the SMBH binary population, except for a general form of the SMBH merger rate density (which is well motivated), to formulate their constraints. As such, they were unable to place meaningful limits on the binary population, while this work is able to place tighter constraints by utilizing a well established range of prior information.

Constraining α, β, and ε with PTAs

It is common for PTA constraints to be quoted as a single number, Ayr, which represents the 95% upper limit on a GWB of a given spectral index: for binary SMBHs, αh =  - 2 / 3 (Eq. [\ref=eq:hpowerlaw]). However, quoting a single number is only for simplicity; the actual result produced by PTAs for a limit on a power-law GWB is a probability distribution for the value of the strain amplitude.

Here we describe the use of this probability distribution to obtain direct limits on α, β, and ε. We then demonstrate how an inconsistency with an observed value can be used to place a lower limit on Tstall.

In terms of Bayesian statistics, a PTA produces a posterior on Ayr,

[formula]

where [formula] is the prior distribution, and [formula] is the likelihood. We are interested in producing a posterior on parameters from our model. As the [formula]-Mbulge relation provides the most influential parameters on Ayr, here we calculate the posteriors on α, β, and ε:

[formula]

Our model gives us a way of translating α, β, and ε into a value of Ayr, which means the two likelihoods are equivalent,

[formula]

We do need to include other observational parameters into our model, specifically the GSMF and the galaxy merger rate. We will represent all of these parameters with θ, which we can marginalize over, giving

[formula]

Fig. [\ref=fig:TriPlot_abe] shows the translation of the recent upper limit from [\citet=ppta+15] into the parameter space that characterizes the [formula]-Mbulge relation. We can set a 95% upper limit in the 2 - D parameter space, α-ε, by integrating the distribution, shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:Bayes_avse]. Similar work has been done in [\citet=middleton+16], where an attempt is made to reconstruct a parametrized form of the black hole merger rate density from a posterior on Ayr from PTAs. This kind of mapping from PTA data to astrophysical parameters is the next step forward in analyzing PTA data and is already being used in recent PTA limit papers [\citep=nanograv+15].

Reconciling PTA limits with [formula]-Mbulge measurements

Fig. [\ref=fig:Bayes_avse] demonstrates that the [\citet=kormendyho13] and [\citet=mcconnellma13] measurements are inconsistent with the upper limit on the GWB by [\citet=ppta+15]. We can thus attempt to reconcile this discrepancy by considering whether a non-zero Tstall can make these two results consistent. If we assume the measured values are correct, then we can do a direct translation of the PPTA upper limit into a probability distribution on Tstall. This is seen in Fig. [\ref=fig:Tstall_UpLim], and we set a lower limit of Tstall > 2.3 Gyrs using [\citet=kormendyho13] and a lower limit of Tstall > 1.2 Gyrs using [\citet=mcconnellma13].

We reiterate that in our formulation, τ essentially represents a dynamical friction timescale (the merger timescale), while Tstall represents the additional time it takes the binary to enter the PTA waveband. Our limits on Tstall could be capturing a longer merger timescale, such as those discussed in [\citet=ravi+15]. However, since there is not a concrete definition for each of these parameters in the literature, we choose to make the straight-forward assumption that after a standard dynamical friction timescale estimate, the remaining time for binary evolution is captured by Tstall.

There are a limited number of observational and theoretical limits on stalling timescales in the literature. Originally, the apparently "missing" inspiral mechanisms were taken to imply that binary SMBHs might stall for up to a Hubble time [\citep=begelman80], although for a few systems with sufficient gas it was shown that binary SMBHs can inspiral efficiently [\citep=mayer+07] [\citep=cuadra+09]. More recently, numerical simulations have demonstrated that with mild triaxiality or axisymmetries in merging galaxies, binary SMBH coalescence timescales can be pushed to [formula] Gyr, and contrary to previous inference, timescales have been found to be much less (< 0.5  Gyr) for the highest-mass galaxies [\citep=preto+11] [\citep=khan+11] [\citep=khan+13]. Furthermore, [\citet=radiocensus] placed an observational upper limit on the stalling timescale of the most massive binary SMBH systems ([formula]) of < 1.25 Gyr at 50% confidence (i. e. a few Gyrs at 95% confidence). The latter observationally-derived value is consistent with our lower limits using both the [\citet=mcconnellma13] and the [\citet=kormendyho13] relations. However, the theoretical result that inspiral due to host axisymmetries can be [formula] Gyr, or beyond < 0.5Gyr for the highest-mass galaxies we're probing here, is in contention with both of these limits. More recent work has shown that for 'dry' mergers, where there is little gas present, the total merger time is > 1 Gyr [\citep=Sesana+15], which is consistent with our limits.

There are two likely interpretations of this result. First, if we assume that the Mbulge relations here hold, we must infer that either something else is reducing the expected GW background (for instance, a turn-over due to environmental coupling or a longer merger timescale than assumed here), or that triaxiality and axisymmetry are not prevalent enough to be the dominant force in driving pre-GW-dominant inspiral in massive galaxies. Second, it is possible that the parameterizations of Mbulge relations have been over-estimated. As a more general consideration for this analysis, it is worth noting here that it has been suggested that recent black hole - host relations might err on using an upper-limit mass value for many black holes in their fits, for a range of valid values [\citet=merrittbook]. Thus, it is possible that the [\citet=mcconnellma13] and [\citet=kormendyho13] measurements have arrived at disproportionately high values, particularly for α and ε. Recent work has proposed there is a bias in these measurements as well [\citep=Shankar+16], and we are currently working to assess what impact this effect would have on our results, we note that a moderate downward shift of both the [\citet=mcconnellma13] and [\citet=kormendyho13] relations in α and/or ε would render fits consistent with current PTA limits (e. g. Fig. [\ref=fig:Bayes_avse]).

As previously noted, there could exist a deviation from a single-power-law GWB spectrum due to essentially the opposite effect from stalling: a super-efficient evolution through low orbital frequencies that also affects the PTA band. This may lead to a low-frequency turn-over in the strain spectrum and significant additional complexity to PTA analysis [\citep=ravi+14] [\citep=huerta+15] [\citep=sampson+15] [\citep=nanograv+15]. An investigation of that possibility is beyond the scope of this paper.

Conclusions

We inspected the amplitude variance of the nHz-μHz waveband GWB, as formulated from state-of-the-art observations of massive galaxies, massive galaxy mergers, and SMBHs in the [formula] Universe. In the course of this analysis we provided simple reference plots which can be used to map PTA limits on the GWB to the parameters of cosmological evolution that most impact the power-law GWB prediction (Figs. [\ref=fig:hvse]-[\ref=fig:hvsTstall]).

We found that the vastly different observations of the intercept (α) and scatter (ε) of the [formula] relation have the most impact on the range of GWB amplitude prediction. We used the most constraining PTA upper limit on the GWB of [formula] from [\citet=ppta+15] to compare with our mapping to these parameters, and found that the [formula] relations of [\citet=mcconnellma13] and [\citet=kormendyho13] are inconsistent with the PTA limit. Both of these measurements include the high-mass SMBHs expected to contribute the majority of signal to the PTA gravitational wave band [\citep=kormendyho13] [\citep=mcconnellma13], making them the appropriate measurements for this comparison.

As discussed in Sec. [\ref=sec:stall], this inconsistency can be reconciled in a number of ways. First, we can include a moderate amount of "stalling" in the inspiral of the binary SMBH, in which the pair slows its evolution for at least 1.2 and 2.3 Gyr for the α,ε values of [\citet=mcconnellma13] and [\citet=kormendyho13], respectively, which are in contention with theoretical work that has shown how axisymmetries may allow inspiral efficiencies of < 0.5Gyr for the most massive pairs.

Observationally, the uncertainty in [formula] and similar relations are largely due to small sample sizes. One important conclusion drawn from this analysis is that better constraints on the [formula] relation will greatly tighten GWB predictions, motivating further SMBH measurements to be made in the [formula] range. Furthermore, it has been pointed out that the masses used for many SMBH - host galaxy relations may be overestimated, potentially solving the discrepancy we have found, as recently noted in [\citet=Shankar+16]. However, this only points more strongly towards a need for better characterization of these relations to allow an accurate prediction of the GWB, which we intend to pursue in more detail in future work. The host-galaxy relation is most critical to be improved if we are to tighten the constraints PTAs can put on effects such as binary stalling, wandering SMBHs, and environmental interactions from the influence of gas or stellar dynamics during the GW-dominant regime. Finally, while the redshift evolution of this relation was not considered in this work, it is clear that strong evolution could further heighten its impact on GWB predictions (see, e. g., [\citealt=ravi+15]).

We conclude by reiterating several caveats. We have considered only a power-law GWB, in which the binary inspiral is decoupled from its environment throughout the nHz-μHz GW band. However, a quantification of super-efficient evolution due to strong environmental coupling poses an equally large, if not much larger, source of uncertainty in the low-frequency end of the PTA band. This must be better assessed via observational and theoretical work.
