Characterization of multiple topological scales in multiplex networks through supra-Laplacian eigengaps

Complex networks exhibit non-traditional critical effects due to their extreme compactness together with their complex organization [\cite=dorogovtsev2008critical]. The introduction of multilayer networks in general, and multiplex networks in particular [\cite=Kivela2014Multilayer], as a more natural substrate for a plethora of phenomena, poses the central theoretical question of whether critical phenomena will behave differently on such networks with respect to traditional networks [\cite=Boccaletti06]. So far, theoretical studies have pointed out that such differences in the critical behavior actually exist [\cite=parshani2010interdependent] [\cite=son2012percolation] [\cite=Cozzo2013]. Recently, it has be shown [\cite=RadicchiArenas] [\cite=radicchi2014driving] that a multiplex network might have different structural phases, the transition among them being abrupt under some conditions. Here we show that there are indeed three different topological scales that can be naturally identified in a multiplex network: they are associated to i) the individual layers; ii) the network of layers; and iii) the aggregate network. Moreover, by using the notion of quotient graph [\cite=sanchez2014dimensionality], we derive the connection between these scales in terms of the spectral properties of the parent multiplex network and its coarse-grained representations.

Given the layer set [formula], in which each index α∈L represents a layer of interaction, consider a set of nodes V, where nodes represent the components of the system, and let GP = (V,L,P) be a binary relation, where P  ⊆  V  ×  L. The statement (u,α)∈P, with u∈V, and α∈L, is read as node u participates in layer α. We call the ordered pair (u,α) a node-layer pair. If each node u∈V has a representative in each layer, i.e., P = V  ×  L, we refer to this multiplex as a node-aligned multiplex [\cite=Kivela2014Multilayer]. Moreover, we denote by n = |V| the number of nodes, and by N = |P| the number of node-layer pairs.

Following the previous definitions, each system of relations or interactions of different kinds is naturally represented by a graph Gβ(Vβ,Eβ), where Vβ  =  {(u,α)∈P|α  =  β}. This representation or graph Gβ will be called a layer-graph. Additionally, consider the graph GC on P in which there is an edge between two node-layer pairs (u,α) and (v,β) if and only if u = v, that is, when the two node-layer pairs represent the same node but in different layers. Thus, it follows that the intra-layer graph can be defined as the union of all layer-graphs, i.e., [formula]. Finally, the supra-graph GM, which is a synthetic representation of the whole multiplex network, can be defined as [formula].

In this paper, we focus our attention on the spectra of the supra-Laplacian, i.e., the Laplacian matrix associated to GM, and show how the interplay between different topological scales affects the whole structural organization of a multiplex network. The spectrum of the Laplacian is a natural choice to address this problem, since it reveals a number of structural properties. In particular, gaps in the Laplacian spectrum (eigenpas) are known to unveil a number of structural and dynamical properties of the network related to the presence of different topological scales in it, from communities at different topological scales to synchronization patterns [\cite=shen2010covariance] [\cite=review_sync]. Thus, the emerging of an eigengap points to structural changes that result in qualitatively different dynamical patterns. For this reason, we introduce a weight parameter p that allows us to tune the relative strength of the coupling with respect to intra-layer connectivity. Note that the weight p might have a physical meaning, like the (inverse of) the commuting time in a multiplex graph representing multimodal transportation networks, however, it can be always intended to be a tuning parameter.

The supra-Laplacian with the weight parameter p reads as:

[formula]

where [formula] is Laplacian of the layer α, while LC is the Laplacian of the coupling graph. In the special case of node-aligned multiplex networks, i.e., multiplex networks in which each node has a representative in each layer, it takes the simple form:

[formula]

where m is the number of layers and [formula] is the adjacency matrix of a complete graph of m nodes. In [\cite=sanchez2014dimensionality], we define two coarse-grained reductions of a multiplex in terms of quotient graphs: the aggregate network and the network of layers, see Fig. [\ref=fig1].

Let a and l be the Laplacian of, respectively, the aggregate network and of the network of layers. They are given by

[formula]

where [formula] is the multiplexity degree matrix, i.e., has the number of layers in which a node has a representative on the diagonal, [formula] is the node characteristic matrix whose elements siu = 1 if and only if the node-layer pair i is a representative of node u, [formula] is the layer size matrix, i.e. has the number of node-layer pairs of each layer on the diagonal, and [formula] is the layer characteristic matrix whose elements siα = 1 only if the node-layer pair i is in layer α.

We denote the eigenvalues of the first Laplacian, a, as [formula] and that of the latter, l, as [formula]. We have that the eigenvalues of the coarse-grained networks interlace that of the parent supra-Laplacian, that is,

[formula]

In particular, the spectrum of the Laplacian of the network of layers is a subset of the spectrum of the parent supra-Laplacian under our assumption, i.e., the eigenvalue mp is always in the spectrum of [formula].

Figure [\ref=toy] shows the full spectrum of a toy node-aligned multiplex network of 4 nodes and 2 layers -thus 8 node-layer pairs. We first note, as claimed in [\cite=gomez2013diffusion] [\cite=sole2013spectral], that the spectrum splits into two groups: one made up by eigenvalues that remain bounded while increasing p, and another group of eigenvalues that diverge linearly with p. The whole characterization of the structural changes in a multiplex network basically depends on this splitting, i.e., on the emerging of gaps in the spectrum. The Laplacian spectrum of the network of layers is composed of just two eigenvalues: 0 with multiplicity 1, and mp with multiplicity (m - 1). Because of the inclusion relation [\cite=sanchez2014dimensionality] between the coarse-grained and the parent spectra, mp will be always an eigenvalue of the supra-Laplacian. It results that, for low enough values of p, mp will be the smallest non-zero eigenvalue of [formula]. On the other hand, each eigenvalue μ̄i of [formula], with [formula], will be bounded by the respective Laplacian eigenvalue (a)i of the aggregate network because of the interlace. It is evident that, by increasing p, at some value p = p*, it will happen that μ̄2  ≠  mp and that it will approach its bound (a)2. For continuity, at p*, μ̄3 = mp must hold, since mp is always an eigenvalue of the supra-Laplacian. p = p* is the point at which the structural transition described in [\cite=RadicchiArenas] [\cite=martin2014algebraic] occurs, as already noted by Darabi Sahneh et al. [\cite=sahneh2014exact]. Each eigenvalue up to μ̄n will follow the same pattern, following the line μ̄i = mp and departing from it to approach its bound (a)i when it hits the next eigenvalue μ̄i = mp (see Fig. [\ref=toy]). At the point [formula] at which μ̄n  ≠  mp, μ̄n + 1 = mp must hold and it will hold forever, since μ̄n + 1 is not bounded.

Continuing with this reasoning, it follows that the supra-Laplacian spectrum for [formula] can be divided into two groups: one of n bounded eigenvalues that will approach the aggregated Laplacian eigenvalues as p increases, and one of N - n = n(m - 1) eigenvalues diverging with p. Therefore, the system can be characterized by an eigengap emerging at [formula]. Moreover, while the splitting of the eigenvalues in these two groups is always present (because of the interlacing), the crossing of the eigenvalues at p* and at [formula] (and between those points) only happens when the multiplex is node-aligned, this is because the inclusion relation only holds in that case.

In order to quantify an eigengap, we introduce the following metric:

[formula]

and we will focus on gn(p), i.e., the gap emerging between the last bounded eigenvalue and the first unbounded at [formula]. By construction

[formula]

For [formula], log (μ̄n + 1) will diverge while log (μ̄n) will remain bounded by (a)n, so gn will approach 1. For [formula], in general, both μ̄n + 1 and μ̄n will be in the continuous part of the spectrum, so gn will be 0 in the large size limit. That is, in the large system size limit,

[formula]

This phenomenology is confirmed by numerical simulations, see Fig. [\ref=g_n]. It describes a structural transition occurring at [formula]. In the case of a non node-aligned multiplex network, where [formula] is not defined since there is no crossing, gn(p) can be used to define it operationally. Indeed, an upper bound for [formula] can be given in terms of the structural properties of the layers. If ω(α)i is the strength of node u in layer α, its strength in the aggregate network is [formula]. Next let's define ij  =  i  +  j, [formula], where i  ~  j indicates a link between i and j in the aggregate network. We have that [\cite=kinkar2005]

[formula]

resulting in the following bound for [formula]

[formula]

The exact value of [formula] can be derived following [\cite=sahneh2014exact] to be

[formula]

being, for the case of two layers, [formula], [formula], and [formula] the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of A.

To further characterize this transition, we next compare a multiplex network M with the coarse-grained networks associated to it. However, a direct comparison is not possible, since those structures have different dimensionality. To overcome this problem, we define an auxiliary structure that has the same properties of the aggregate network and the network of layers, but also the same dimensionality of M. We call it the Aggregate-Equivalent Multiplex (AEM). The AEM of a parent multiplex network M is a multiplex network with the same number of layers of M, each layer being identical to the aggregate network of M. Additionally, node-layer pairs representing the same nodes are connected with a connection pattern identical to the network of layers. Formally speaking, the AEM is given by the Cartesian product between the aggregate network and the network of layers. Thus, its adjacency matrix is given by

[formula]

where [formula] is the adjacency matrix of the aggregate network, and its Laplacian matrix is given by

[formula]

where a is the Laplacian matrix of the network of layer and [formula] is the Laplacian of a complete graph of m nodes. Its Laplacian spectrum is completely determined in terms of the spectra of a and of the spectra of l. In particular, we have

[formula]

That is, each eigenvalue of [formula] is the sum of an eigenvalue of a and an eigenvalue of l. We also note that, since 0 is an eigenvalue of both coarse-grained Laplacians, the spectrum of both a and l are included in the spectrum of [formula].

To compare the parent multiplex network with its AEM, we compute the quantum relative entropies between the former and the latter. The quantum entropy (or Von-Neumann entropy) of M is defined as

[formula]

where [formula], with E being the number of intra-layer links in M [\cite=passerini2009quantifying], i.e., ρ is the supra-Laplacian normalized by the degree sum. Thus, the quantum relative entropy of the multiplex network M with its associated AEM is defined as

[formula]

where σ is the supra-Laplacian of the AEM normalized by its degree sum without considering self-loops. In Fig. [\ref=entr] we show the quantum relative entropy between the parent multiplex and its AEM: it goes to 0 when p increases, which means that the parent multiplex will be indistinguishable from the AEM. Finally, it is informative to look at the quantum entropy of M. Sq(M) shows a clear peak after p* and before [formula] (see the inset of Fig. [\ref=entr]), i.e., in the region after the transition observed in [\cite=RadicchiArenas] [\cite=martin2014algebraic] and before the one we have introduced here. In fact, by studying the sign of the derivative of Sq, it can be proven that the quantum entropy must have a peak before [formula].

To gain intuition on the phenomenological implications of our findings, it is enlightening to consider a diffusion dynamics. In such a dynamics, the large time scale is dominated by the bounded group of eigenvalues for [formula]. These eigenvalues are close to those of the aggregate network, indicating that each layer shows practically the same behavior of the latter network. This is because the fast time scale is dominated by the diverging group of eigenvalues that are close to those of the aggregate network plus those of the network of layers. In summary, the network of layers determines how each node-layer pair accommodates with its replica on a fast time scale, being always "at equilibrium", while the aggregate network determines how and on what time scale the global equilibrium is attained. From this point of view, the "world" will look the same from each layer and it will look like in the aggregate network. From the viewpoint of a random walk, we can look at the average commute time c(i,j), i.e., the mean time needed by a walker starting in i to hit node j for the first time and coming back. This quantity can be expressed in terms of the eigenvalue of [formula], the pseudoinverse of the supra-laplacian. Since the eigenvalues of [formula] are the reciprocal of the eigenvalues of [formula], the aggregate network mean commute time (i,j) is a good approximation of c(i,j) after [formula][\cite=saerens2004principal]:

[formula]

In summary, in this paper, capitalizing on the coarse-grained representations of a multiplex network via the aggregate network and the network of layers, we have unveiled the following structural phases as a function of p: before p* the system is structurally dominated by the network of layers, whereas after [formula] it is structurally dominated by the aggregate network. Between these two points the system is in an effective multiplex state, i.e., neither of the coarse-grained structures dominate. We have also shown that the novel structural transition at [formula] is rooted in a gap that appears between the n-th and the (n + 1)-th eigenvalues of the supra-Laplacian. In this region the VN-entropy -a measure of structural complexity - shows a peak. Finally, the definition of the Aggregate-Equivalent Multiplex allowed to compare the multiplex with its associated coarse-grained representations and to show that the relative entropy between the parent multiplex and its AEM varies smoothly with p, which implies that the two transitions are smooth from a global point of view. Altogether, the present work provides a full understanding of the spectrum of the supra-Laplacian of a multiplex network.
