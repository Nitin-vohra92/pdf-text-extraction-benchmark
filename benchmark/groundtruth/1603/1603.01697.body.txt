Introduction

For given k-uniform hypergraphs G and H, the Ramsey number R(G,H) is the smallest positive integer N such that in every red-blue coloring of the edges of the complete k-uniform hypergraph KkN, there is a red copy of G or a blue copy of H. A k-uniform loose cycle Ckn (shortly, a cycle of length n) is a hypergraph with vertex set [formula] and with the set of n edges [formula], [formula], where we use mod n(k - 1) arithmetic and adding a number t to a set [formula] means a shift, i.e. the set obtained by adding t to subscripts of each element of H. Similarly, a k-uniform loose path Pkn (shortly, a path of length n) is a hypergraph with vertex set [formula] and with the set of n edges [formula], [formula]. For an edge [formula] of a given loose path (also a given loose cycle) K, the first vertex (v(i - 1)(k - 1) + 1) and the last vertex (vi(k - 1) + 1) are denoted by fK,ei and lK,ei, respectively. In this paper, we consider the problem of finding the 2-color Ramsey number of k-uniform loose paths and cycles for k = 4,5.

The investigation of the Ramsey numbers of hypergraph loose cycles was initiated by Haxell et al. in [\cite=Ramsy_number_of_loose_cycle]. They proved that R(C3n,C3n) is asymptotically [formula]. This result was extended by Gyárfás, Sárközy and Szemerédi [\cite=Ramsy_number_of_loose_cycle_for_k-uniform] to k-uniform loose cycles. More precisely, they proved that for all η > 0 there exists n0 = n0(η) such that for every n > n0, every 2-coloring of KkN with [formula] contains a monochromatic copy of Ckn.

In [\cite=subm], Gyárfás and Raeisi determined the value of the Ramsey number of a k-uniform loose triangle and quadrangle. Recently, we proved the following general result on the Ramsey numbers of loose paths and loose cycles in 3-uniform hypergraphs.

For every n  ≥  m  ≥  3,

[formula]

In [\cite=Ramsey_numbers_of_loose_cycles_in_uniform_hypergraphs], we presented another proof of Theorem [\ref=Omidi] and posed the following conjecture.

Let k  ≥  3 be an integer number. For every n  ≥  m  ≥  3,

[formula]

Also, the following theorem is obtained on the Ramsey number of loose paths and cycles in k-uniform hypergraphs [\cite=Ramsey_numbers_of_loose_cycles_in_uniform_hypergraphs].

Let n  ≥  m  ≥  2 be given integers and [formula] Then [formula] and [formula]. Moreover, for n = m we have [formula].

Using Theorem [\ref=connection], one can easily see that Conjecture [\ref=our_conjecture] is equivalent to the following.

Let k  ≥  3 be an integer number. For every n  ≥  m  ≥  3,

[formula]

Recently, it is shown that Conjecture [\ref=our_conjecture2] holds for n = m and k  ≥  8 (see [\cite=diagonal]). In this paper, we investigate Conjecture [\ref=our_conjecture2] for k = 4,5. More precisely, we extend the method that used in [\cite=Ramsey_numbers_of_loose_cycles_in_uniform_hypergraphs] and we show that Conjecture [\ref=our_conjecture2] holds for k = 4 where n > m or n = m is odd. When n = m is even we show that R(C4n,C4m) either is the value that is claimed in Conjecture [\ref=our_conjecture2] or is equal to this value minus one. Also, we demonstrate that Conjecture [\ref=our_conjecture2] holds for k = 5 when [formula]. Consequently, using Theorem [\ref=connection], we obtained the values of some Ramsey numbers involving paths. Throughout the paper, by Lemma 1 of [\cite=subm], it suffices to prove only the upper bound for the claimed Ramsey numbers. The last section of this paper contains some concluding remarks. Throughout the paper, for a 2-edge colored hypergraph H we denote by Hred and Hblue the induced hypergraphs on red edges and blue edges, respectively. Also we denote by |H| and [formula] the number of vertices and edges of H, respectively.

Preliminaries

In this section, we prove some lemmas that will be needed in our main results. Also, we recall some results from [\cite=subm] and [\cite=Ramsey_numbers_of_loose_cycles_in_uniform_hypergraphs].

For every k  ≥  3,

R(Pk3,Pk3) = R(Ck3,Pk3) = R(Ck3,Ck3) + 1 = 3k - 1,

R(Pk4,Pk4) = R(Ck4,Pk4) = R(Ck4,Ck4) + 1 = 4k - 2.

Let n,k  ≥  3 be integer numbers. Then

[formula]

In order to state our main results we need some definitions. Let H be a 2-edge colored complete k-uniform hypergraph for k  ≥  4, P be a loose path in H and W be a set of vertices with [formula]. By a ϖS-configuration, we mean a copy of Pk2 with edges

[formula]

so that {x,y}  ⊆  W and [formula] is a set of unordered vertices of k - 1 consecutive edges of P with [formula] The vertices x and y are called the end vertices of this configuration. A ϖS-configuration, [formula], is good if at least one of the vertices of [formula] is not in S. We say that a monochromatic path [formula] is maximal with respect to (w.r.t. for short) [formula] if there is no W'  ⊆  W so that for some 1  ≤  r  ≤  n and 1  ≤  i  ≤  n - r + 1,

[formula]

is a monochromatic path with n + 1 edges and the following properties:

[formula],

if i = 1, then fP',e'i = fP,ei,

if i + r - 1 = n, then lP',e'i + r = lP,en.

Clearly, if P is maximal w.r.t. W, then it is maximal w.r.t. every W'  ⊆  W and also every loose path P' which is a sub-hypergraph of P is again maximal w.r.t. W.

We use these definitions to deduce the following essential lemma.

Assume that k  ≥  4 and H  =  Kkn is 2-edge colored red and blue. Let P  ⊆  Hred be a maximal path w.r.t. W, where [formula] and |W|  ≥  k. For every k - 2 consecutive edges [formula] of P there is a good ϖS-configuration, say C = fg, in Hblue with end vertices x∈f and y∈g in W and [formula]. Moreover, there are two subsets W1  ⊆  W and W2  ⊆  W with |W1|  ≥  |W| - (k - 2) and |W2|  ≥  |W| - (k - 1) so that for every distinct vertices x'∈W1 and y'∈W2, the path [formula] is also a good ϖS-configuration in Hblue with end vertices x' and y' in W.

By an argument similar to the proof of Lemma [\ref=spacial_configuration1], we have the following general result.

Assume that k  ≥  4 and H  =  Kkn, is 2-edge colored red and blue. Let P  ⊆  Hred be a maximal path w.r.t. W, where [formula] and |W|  ≥  k. Let A1  =  {fP,e1} and [formula] for i > 1. Then for every k - 2 consecutive edges [formula] of P and for each u∈Ai there is a good ϖS-configuration, say C = fg, in Hblue with end vertices x∈f and y∈g in W and

[formula]

for some v∈Ak + i - 2. Moreover, there are two subsets W1  ⊆  W and W2  ⊆  W with |W1|  ≥  |W| - (k - 2) and |W2|  ≥  |W| - (k - 1) so that for every distinct vertices x'∈W1 and y'∈W2, the path [formula] is also a good ϖS-configuration in Hblue with end vertices x' and y' in W.

The following result is an immediate corollary of Lemma [\ref=spacial_configuration2].

Let k∈{4,5} and H  =  Kkl be two edge colored red and blue. Also let [formula] n  ≥  k - 2, be a maximal red path w.r.t. W, where [formula] and |W|  ≥  k. Then for some r  ≥  0 and W'  ⊆  W there are two disjoint blue paths Q and Q', with [formula] and

[formula]

between W' and [formula] so that [formula] is actually the end vertex of e for each edge [formula] and at least one of the vertices of [formula] is not in [formula]. Moreover, if [formula] then either [formula] or x  ≥  k - 1 and 0  ≤  r  ≤  k - 3. Otherwise, either [formula] or x  ≥  k - 3 and 0  ≤  r  ≤  k - 3.

Ramsey number of 4-uniform loose cycles

In this section we investigate Conjecture [\ref=our_conjecture2] for k = 4. Indeed, we determine the exact value of R(C4n,C4m), where n > m  ≥  3 and n = m is odd. When n = m is even, we show that R(C4n,C4n) is between two values with difference one. For this purpose we need the following essential lemma.

Let n  ≥  m  ≥  3, (n,m)  ≠  (3,3),(4,3),(4,4) and

[formula]

Assume that H  =  K43n + t is 2-edge colored red and blue and there is no copy of C4n in Hred. If C  =  C4n - 1  ⊆  Hred, then C4m  ⊆  Hblue.

The following results are the main results of this section.

For every n  ≥  m + 1  ≥  4,

[formula]

For every n  ≥  4,

[formula]

Using Lemma 1 of [\cite=subm] and Theorem [\ref=main_theorem1] we conclude the following corollary.

Let n  ≥  4. If n is odd, then [formula] Otherwise,

[formula]

Clearly using the above results on the Ramsey number of loose cycles and Theorem [\ref=connection], we obtain the following results.

If n  ≥  m + 1  ≥  4 or n = m is odd, then

[formula]

If n  ≥  m + 2  ≥  5 or n is odd, then

[formula]

Ramsey number of 5-uniform loose cycles

In this section we determine the exact value of the Ramsey number R(C5n,C5m) of 5-uniform loose cycles C5n and C5m, where [formula]

Let H  =  K5q be 2-edge colored red and blue and [formula] be a maximal path w.r.t. W, where [formula] and |W|  ≥  7. For every two consecutive edges ei and ei + 1 of P there is a P53  ⊆  Hred, say Q, with end vertices in W such that [formula] at least one of the vertices of [formula] is not in Q and [formula]. Moreover, each vertex of W, with the exception of at most one, can be considered as an end vertex of Q.

By an argument similar to the proof of Lemma [\ref=there_is_P3], we have the following general lemma.

Let H  =  K5q be 2-edge colored red and blue and [formula] be a maximal path w.r.t. W, where [formula] and |W|  ≥  7. Assume that A1  =  {fP,e1} and [formula] for i > 1. Then for every two consecutive edges ei and ei + 1 of P and for each u∈Ai, there is a P53  ⊆  Hred, say Q, with end vertices in W such that [formula] at least one of the vertices of Ai + 2 is not in Q and [formula]. Moreover, each vertex of W, with the exception of at most one, can be considered as an end vertex of Q.

We shall use Lemmas [\ref=there_is_P3] and [\ref=there_is_P3:2] to prove the following basic lemma.

Let [formula], m  ≥  4, and [formula] be 2-edge colored red and blue. If there is no copy of C5m in Hblue and C  =  C5m - 1  ⊆  Hblue, then C5n - 1  ⊆  Hred.

Let [formula], 6  ≥  m  ≥  4 and [formula] be 2-edge colored red and blue. If there is no red copy of C5n and C  =  C5n - 1  ⊆  Hred, then C5m  ⊆  Hblue.

Let [formula], m  ≥  7 and [formula] be 2-edge colored red and blue. If there is no red copy of C5n and C  =  C5n - 1  ⊆  Hred, then C5m  ⊆  Hblue.

We shall use Theorem [\ref=R(C3] [\ref=C4)] and Lemmas [\ref=pm-1_implies_pn-1] and [\ref=Cn-1_implies_cm] to prove the following main theorem.

For every [formula],
