On a complete topological inverse polycyclic monoid

In this paper all topological spaces will be assumed to be Hausdorff. We shall follow the terminology of [\cite=Carruth-Hildebrant-Koch-1983-1986] [\cite=Clifford-Preston-1961-1967] [\cite=Engelking-1989] [\cite=Lawson-1998]. If A is a subset of a topological space X, then we denote the closure of the set A in X by [formula]. By [formula] we denote the set of all positive integers and by ω the first infinite cardinal.

A semigroup S is called an inverse semigroup if every a in S possesses an unique inverse, i.e. if there exists an unique element a- 1 in S such that A map which associates to any element of an inverse semigroup its inverse is called the inversion.

A band is a semigroup of idempotents. If S is a semigroup, then we shall denote the subset of idempotents in S by E(S). If S is an inverse semigroup, then E(S) is closed under multiplication. The semigroup operation on S determines the following partial order [formula] on E(S): [formula] if and only if ef = fe = e. This order is called the natural partial order on E(S). A semilattice is a commutative semigroup of idempotents. A semilattice E is called linearly ordered or a chain if its natural order is a linear order. A maximal chain of a semilattice E is a chain which is properly contained in no other chain of E. The Axiom of Choice implies the existence of maximal chains in any partially ordered set. According to [\cite=Petrich-1984] a chain L is called ω-chain if L is order isomorphic to [formula] with the usual order [formula]. Let E be a semilattice and e∈E. We denote [formula] and [formula].

If S is a semigroup, then we shall denote by [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula] the Green relations on S (see [\cite=GreenJ1951] or [\cite=Clifford-Preston-1961-1967]):

The [formula]-class (resp., [formula]-, [formula]-, or [formula]-class) of the semigroup S which contains an element a of S will be denoted by Ra (resp., La, Ha, or Da).

The bicyclic monoid [formula] is the semigroup with the identity 1 generated by two elements p and q subjected only to the condition pq = 1. The semigroup operation on [formula] is determined as follows: It is well known that the bicyclic monoid [formula] is a bisimple (and hence simple) combinatorial E-unitary inverse semigroup and every non-trivial congruence on [formula] is a group congruence [\cite=Clifford-Preston-1961-1967]. Also the well known Andersen Theorem states that a simple semigroup S with an idempotent is completely simple if and only if S does not contains an isomorphic copy of the bicyclic semigroup (see [\cite=Andersen-1952] and [\cite=Clifford-Preston-1961-1967]).

Let λ be a non-zero cardinal. On the set [formula], where 0∉λ  ×  λ, we define the semigroup operation "    ·    " as follows and (a,b)  ·  0 = 0  ·  (a,b) = 0  ·  0 = 0 for a,b,c,d∈λ. The semigroup Bλ is called the semigroup of λ  ×  λ-matrix units (see [\cite=Clifford-Preston-1961-1967]).

In 1970 Nivat and Perrot proposed the following generalization of the bicyclic monoid (see [\cite=Nivat-Perrot-1970] and [\cite=Lawson-1998]). For a non-zero cardinal λ, the polycyclic monoid on λ generators Pλ is the semigroup with zero given by the presentation: It is obvious that in the case when λ = 1 the semigroup P1 is isomorphic to the bicyclic semigroup with adjoined zero. For every finite non-zero cardinal λ = n the polycyclic monoid Pn is a congruence free, combinatorial, 0-bisimple, 0-E-unitary inverse semigroup (see [\cite=Lawson-1998]).

A topological (inverse) semigroup is a Hausdorff topological space together with a continuous semigroup operation (and an inversion, respectively). Obviously, the inversion defined on a topological inverse semigroup is a homeomorphism. If S is a semigroup (an inverse semigroup) and τ is a topology on S such that (S,τ) is a topological (inverse) semigroup, then we shall call τ a (inverse) semigroup topology on S. A semitopological semigroup is a Hausdorff topological space endowed with a separately continuous semigroup operation.

Let [formula] be a class of topological semigroups. A semigroup [formula] is called H-closed in [formula], if S is a closed subsemigroup of any topological semigroup [formula] which contains S both as a subsemigroup and as a topological space. The H-closed topological semigroups were introduced by Stepp in [\cite=Stepp-1969], and there they were called maximal semigroups. A topological semigroup [formula] is called absolutely H-closed in the class [formula], if any continuous homomorphic image of S into [formula] is H-closed in [formula]. Absolutely H-closed topological semigroups were introduced by Stepp in [\cite=Stepp-1975], and there they were called absolutely maximal.

Recall [\cite=Aleksandrov-1942], a topological group G is called absolutely closed if G is a closed subgroup of any topological group which contains G as a subgroup. In our terminology such topological groups are called H-closed in the class of topological groups. In [\cite=Raikov-1946] Raikov proved that a topological group G is absolutely closed if and only if it is Raikov complete, i.e., G is complete with respect to the two-sided uniformity. A topological group G is called h-complete if for every continuous homomorphism h:G  →  H the subgroup f(G) of H is closed [\cite=Dikranjan-Uspenskij-1998]. In our terminology such topological groups are called absolutely H-closed in the class of topological groups. The h-completeness is preserved under taking products and closed central subgroups [\cite=Dikranjan-Uspenskij-1998]. H-closed paratopological and topological groups in the class of paratopological groups were studied in [\cite=Ravsky-2003]. The paper [\cite=Bardyla-Gutik-Ravsky-2016-?] contains a sufficient condition for a quasitopological group to be H-closed, which allowed us to solve a problem by Arhangel'skii and Choban [\cite=Arhangelskii-Choban-2009] and show that a topological group G is H-closed in the class of quasitopological groups if and only if G is Rakov-complete. In [\cite=Gutik-2014] it is proved that a topological group G is H-closed in the class of semitopological inverse semigroups with continuous inversion if and only if G is compact.

In [\cite=Stepp-1975] Stepp studied H-closed topological semilattices in the class of topological semigroups. There he proved that an algebraic semilattice E is algebraically h-complete in the class of topological semilattices if and only if every chain in E is finite. In [\cite=Gutik-Repovs-2008] Gutik and Repov studied the closure of a linearly ordered topological semilattice in a topological semilattice. They obtained a characterization of H-closed linearly ordered topological semilattices in the class of topological semilattices and showed that every H-closed linear topological semilattice is absolutely H-closed in the class of topological semilattices. Such semilattices were studied also in [\cite=Chuchman-Gutik-2007] [\cite=Gutik-Pagon-Repovs-2010]. In [\cite=Bardyla-Gutik-2012] the closures of the discrete semilattices [formula] and [formula] were described. In that paper the authors constructed an example of an H-closed topological semilattice in the class of topological semilattices, which is not absolutely H-closed in the class of topological semilattices. The constructed example gives a negative answer to Question 17 from [\cite=Stepp-1975]. H-closed and absolutely H-closed (semi)topological semigroups and their extensions in different classes of topological and semitopological semigroups were studied in [\cite=Berezovski-Gutik-Pavlyk-2010] [\cite=Gutik-2014] [\cite=Gutik-Lawson-Repovs-2009] [\cite=Gutik-Pavlyk-2001] [\cite=Gutik-Pavlyk-2003] [\cite=Gutik-Pavlyk-2005] [\cite=Gutik-Pavlyk-Reiter-2009] [\cite=Gutik-Reiter-2009] [\cite=Gutik-Reiter-2010]

In [\cite=Bardyla-Gutik-2016-?] we showed that the λ-polycyclic monoid for in infinite cardinal [formula] has similar algebraic properties to that of the polycyclic monoid Pn with finitely many [formula] generators. In particular we proved that for every infinite cardinal λ the polycyclic monoid Pλ is a congruence-free, combinatorial, 0-bisimple, 0-E-unitary, inverse semigroup. Also we showed that every non-zero element x∈Pλ is an isolated point in (Pλ,τ) for every Hausdorff topology on Pλ, such that Pλ is a semitopological semigroup; moreover, every locally compact Hausdorff semigroup topology on Pλ is discrete. The last statement extends results of the paper [\cite=Mesyan-Mitchell-Morayne-Peresse-20??] treating topological inverse graph semigroups. We described all feebly compact topologies τ on Pλ such that [formula] is a semitopological semigroup. Also in [\cite=Bardyla-Gutik-2016-?] we proved that for every cardinal [formula] any continuous homomorphism from a topological semigroup Pλ into an arbitrary countably compact topological semigroup is annihilating and there exists no Hausdorff feebly compact topological semigroup containing Pλ as a dense subsemigroup.

This paper is a continuation of [\cite=Bardyla-Gutik-2016-?]. In this paper we give sufficient conditions on a topological inverse λ-polycyclic monoid Pλ to be absolutely H-closed in the class of topological inverse semigroups. For every infinite cardinal λ we construct the coarsest semigroup inverse topology τmi on Pλ and give an example of a topological inverse monoid S which contains the polycyclic monoid P2 as a dense discrete subsemigroup.

It is well known that for an arbitrary topological inverse semigroup S and every element x∈S the continuity of the semigroup operation and the inversion in S implies that any [formula]-class Lx and any [formula]-class Rx which contain the element x are closed subsets in S. Indeed, the Wagner-Preston Theorem (see Theorem 1.17 from [\cite=Clifford-Preston-1961-1967]) implies that Lx = Lx- 1x and Rx = Rxx- 1 for arbitrary x∈S and since the maps φ:S  →  E(S) and ψ:S  →  E(S) defined by the formulae are continuous, we get that Lx = (x- 1x)ψ- 1 and Rx = (xx- 1)φ- 1 are closed subsets of the topological semigroup S. This implies that for any idempotents e and f of a topological inverse semigroup S the following [formula]-classes of S: are closed subsets of the topological inverse semigroup S too. Moreover, the relations [formula], [formula] and [formula] are closed subsets in S  ×  S, but [formula] and [formula] are not necessary closed subsets in S  ×  S for an arbitrary topological inverse semigroup S (see [\cite=Eberhart-Selden-1969]).

The following proposition describes [formula]-equivalent [formula]-classes in an arbitrary topological inverse semigroup.

Let S be a Hausdorff topological inverse semigroup and a,c be [formula]-equivalent elements of S. Then there exists b∈S such that [formula] and [formula] in S, and hence as = b, [formula], tb = c, [formula], for some [formula]. The mappings [formula] and [formula] are continuous and mutually inverse, and hence are homeomorphisms of closed subspaces Ha and Hc of the topological space S. Moreover, if Ha and Hc are subgroups of S then Ha and Hc are topologically isomorphic closed topological subgroups in the topological inverse semigroup S.

The above arguments imply that Ha and Hc are closed subspaces of S. Also, the algebraic part of the statement of our theorem follows from Theorem 2.3 of [\cite=Clifford-Preston-1961-1967] and Theorem 1.2.7 from [\cite=Higgins-1992]. The continuity of the semigroup operation in S implies that the maps [formula] and [formula] are continuous and hence are homeomorphisms. Now, the proof of Theorem 1.2.7 from [\cite=Higgins-1992] implies that in the case when Ha and Hc are subgroups of S, then there exist [formula] such that the maps [formula] and [formula] are mutually inverse isomorphisms and the continuity of the semigroup operation in S implies that so defined maps are topological isomorphisms.

The proof of Proposition [\ref=proposition-5.1] implies that any two [formula]-equivalent [formula]-classes of a Hausdorff semitopological semigroup S are homeomorphic subspaces in S, but they are not necessary closed subspaces in S, and a similar statement holds for maximal subgroups in S (see [\cite=Gutik-2014]).

Let T and S be a Hausdorff topological inverse semigroup such that S is an inverse subsemigroup of T. Let G be an [formula]-class in S which is a closed subset of the topological inverse semigroup T and DG be a [formula]-class of the semigroup S which contains the set G. Then every [formula]-class H  ⊆  DG of the semigroup S is a closed subset of the topological space T.

First we consider the case when G has an idempotent, i.e., G is a maximal subgroup of the semigroup S (see Theorem 2.16 of [\cite=Clifford-Preston-1961-1967]).

In the case when the [formula]-class H contains an idempotent, Theorem 2.16 in [\cite=Clifford-Preston-1961-1967] implies that H is a maximal subgroup of S and hence H is a subgroup of topological inverse semigroup T. We put e and f are unit elements of the groups G and H, respectively. Since the idempotents e and f are [formula]-equivalent in S, Proposition 3.2.5 of [\cite=Lawson-1998] implies that there exists a∈S such that aa- 1 = e and a- 1a = f. Now by Proposition 3.2.11(5) of [\cite=Lawson-1998] the idempotents e and f are [formula]-equivalent in the semigroup T. Put HTe and HTf be the [formula]-classes of idempotents e and f in the semigroup T, respectively. We define the maps [formula] and [formula] by the formulae [formula] and [formula], respectively. Then for any s∈HTe and t∈HTf we get the equalities because aa- 1 = ss- 1 = s- 1s = e, ea = a, af = a and a- 1a = tt- 1 = t- 1 = f. Similarly, for arbitrary s,v∈HTe and t,u∈HTf we have that and

Hence the restrictions [formula] and [formula] are mutually invertible group isomorphisms. Also, since a∈S we get that the restrictions [formula] and [formula] are mutually invertible group isomorphisms too. This and the continuity of left and right translations in T imply that H is a closed subgroup of the topological inverse semigroup T.

Next we consider the case when the [formula]-class H contains no idempotents. Then there exists distinct idempotents e,f∈S such that ss- 1 = e and s- 1s = f for all s∈H. Suppose to the contrary that H is not a closed subset of the topological inverse semigroup T. Then there exists an accumulation point [formula] of the set H in the topological space T. Since every [formula]-class of a topological inverse semigroup T is a closed subset of T we get that H and x are contained in a same [formula]-class Hx of the semigroup T. Then xx- 1 = e and x- 1x = f. Now the [formula]-class HTe in T which contains the idempotent e∈S is a topological subgroup of the topological inverse semigroup T and by Proposition [\ref=proposition-5.1] the subspace HTe of the topological space T is homeomorphic to the subspace Hx of T. Moreover, Theorem 1.2.7 from [\cite=Higgins-1992] implies that there exists a homeomorphism [formula] such that the image [formula] is a topological subgroup of the topological inverse semigroup T and [formula] is topologically isomorphic to the topological group G. Then [formula] is not a closed subgroup of T which contradicts our above part of the proof.

Assume that G has no idempotents. By the previous part of the proof it suffices to show that there exists a maximal subgroup He with an idempotent e in the [formula]-class DG such that He is a closed subgroup of topological semigroup T. Suppose to the contrary that every maximal subgroup in the [formula]-class DG is not a closed in T. Fix and arbitrary subgroup He with an idempotent e in the [formula]-class DG such that xx- 1 = e for all x∈G. Then Proposition 3.2.11(3) of [\cite=Lawson-1998] implies that there exist [formula]-classes HTG and HTe in the semigroup T which contain the set G and group He. Since in the topological semigroup T every [formula]-class is a closed subset in T, we have that G is a closed subset of the space HTG and He is not a closed subgroup of the topological group HTe. Then Proposition 3.2.11 of [\cite=Lawson-1998] and Proposition [\ref=proposition-5.1] imply that there exist [formula] such that the maps [formula] and [formula] are mutually invertible homeomorphisms of the topological spaces HTe and HTG such that the restrictions [formula] and [formula] are mutually invertible homeomorphisms. This is a contradiction, because He is not a closed subset of HTe. This completes the proof of the lemma.

Lemma [\ref=lemma-5.3] implies the following corollary.

Let T and S be a Hausdorff topological inverse semigroup such that S is an inverse subsemigroup of T. Let G be a maximal subgroup in S which is H-closed in the class of topological inverse semigroups and DG be a [formula]-class of the semigroup S which contains the group G. Then every [formula]-class H  ⊆  DG of the semigroup S is a closed subset of the topological space T.

Let S be a Hausdorff topological inverse semigroup such the following conditions hold:

every maximal subgroup of the semigroup S is H-closed in the class topological groups;

all non-minimal elements of the semilattice E(S) are isolated points in E(S).

If there exists a topological inverse semigroup T such that S is a dense subsemigroup of T and [formula] then for every [formula] at least one of the points x  ·  x- 1 or x- 1  ·  x belongs to [formula].

First we consider the case when the topological semilattice E(S) does not have the smallest element. Then the space E(S) is discrete and Theorem 3.3.9 of [\cite=Engelking-1989] implies that E(S) is an open subset of the topological space E(T) and hence every point of the set E(S) is isolated in E(T). Also by Proposition II.3 [\cite=Eberhart-Selden-1969] we have that [formula] and hence the points of the set [formula] are not isolated in the space E(T).

Fix an arbitrary point [formula]. By Corollary [\ref=corollary-5.4] every [formula]-class is a closed subset of the topological inverse semigroup T. Since x is an accumulation point of the set S in the topological space T we have that every open neighbourhood U(x) of the point x in T intersects infinitely many [formula]-classes of the semigroup S. By Proposition II.1 of [\cite=Eberhart-Selden-1969] the inversion on T is a homeomorphism of the topological space T and hence [formula] is an open neighbourhood of the point x- 1 in T which intersects infinitely many [formula]-classes of the semigroup S. Then the continuity of the semigroup operations and the inversion in T implies that at least one of the sets [formula] or [formula] is infinite for every open neighbourhood U(x) of the point x in the topological semigroup T. This implies that at least one of x  ·  x- 1 or x- 1  ·  x is a non-isolated point in the topological space E(T).

In the case when the semilattice E(S) has a minimal idempotent the presented above arguments imply that for arbitrary point [formula] and every open neighbourhood U(x) of the point x in T one of the sets [formula] or [formula] is infinite for every open neighbourhood U(x) of the point x in the topological semigroup T. Since He is a minimal ideal of S and it is a Raı kov complete topological group. Then there exists an open neighborhood U(x) of x in T, such that [formula]. If xx- 1 = e or x- 1x = e then x = xx- 1x∈He, which contradicts that [formula]. Hence [formula] or [formula].

Lemma [\ref=lemma-5.5] implies the following two corollaries.

Let S be a Hausdorff topological inverse semigroup satisfying the following conditions:

every maximal subgroup of the semigroup S and the semilattice E(S) are H-closed in the class of topological inverse semigroups;

all non-minimal elements of the semilattice E(S) are isolated points in E(S).

Then S is H-closed in the class of topological inverse semigroups.

Let [formula] and let Pλ be a proper dense subsemigroup of a topological inverse semigroup S. Then either [formula] or [formula] for every [formula].

The following theorem gives sufficient condition when a topological inverse λ-polycyclic monoid Pλ is absolutely H-closed in the class of topological inverse semigroups.

Let λ be a cardinal [formula] and τ be a Hausdorff inverse semigroup topology on Pλ such that [formula] is an infinite set for every open neighborhood U(0) of zero 0 in (Pλ,τ) and every maximal chain L of the semilattice E(Pλ). Then (Pλ,τ) is absolutely H-closed in the class of topological inverse semigroups.

First we observe that the definition of the λ-polycyclic monoid Pλ implies that for every maximal chain L in E(Pλ) the set [formula] is an ω-chain. Then Theorem 2 of [\cite=Bardyla-Gutik-2012] implies that every maximal chain L in E(Pλ) with the induced topology from (Pλ,τ) is an absolutely H-closed topological semilattice. Suppose that E(Pλ) with the induced topology from (Pλ,τ) is not an H-closed topological semilattice. Then there exists a topological semilattice S which contains E(Pλ) as a dense proper subsemilattice. Also the continuity of the semilattice operation in S implies that zero 0 of E(Pλ) is zero in S. Fix an arbitrary element [formula]. Then for an arbitrary open neighbourhood U(x) of the point x in S such that 0∉U(x) the continuity of the semilattice operation in S implies that there exists an open neighbourhood V(x)  ⊆  U(x) of x in S such that V(x)  ·  V(x)  ⊆  U(x). Now, the neighbourhood V(x) intersects infinitely many maximal chains of the semilattice E(Pλ), because all maximal chains in E(Pλ) with the induced topology from (Pλ,τ) are absolutely H-closed topological semilattices. Then the semigroup operation of Pλ implies that 0∈V(x)  ·  V(x)  ⊆  U(x), which contradicts the choice of the neighbourhood U(0). Therefore, E(Pλ) with the induced topology from (Pλ,τ) is an H-closed topological semilattice.

Now, by Corollary [\ref=corollary-5.6] the topological inverse semigroup (Pλ,τ) is H-closed in the class of topological inverse semigroups. Since the λ-polycyclic monoid Pλ is congruence free, every continuous homomorphic image of (Pλ,τ) is H-closed in the class of topological inverse semigroups. Indeed, if h:(Pλ,τ)  →  T is a continuous (algebraic) homomorphism from (Pλ,τ) into a topological inverse semigroup T, then the set [formula] is infinite for every open neighbourhood U(h(0)) of the image zero h(0) in T. Then the previous part of the proof implies that h(Pλ) is a closed subsemigroup of T.

By Remark 2.6 from [\cite=Jones-Lawson-2014] (also see [\cite=Jones-Lawson-2014], [\cite=Jones-2011] and [\cite=Lawson-1998]) for every positive integer [formula] any non-zero element x of the polycyclic monoid Pn has the form u- 1v, where u and v are elements of the free monoid [formula], and the semigroup operation on Pn in this representation is defined in the following way:

[formula]

Then Lemma 2.4 of [\cite=Bardyla-Gutik-2016-?] implies that every any non-zero element x of the polycyclic monoid Pλ has the form u- 1v, where u and v are elements of the free monoid [formula], and the semigroup operation on Pλ in this representation is defined by formula ([\ref=eq-5.1]).

Now we shall construct a topology [formula] on the λ-polycyclic monoid Pλ such that [formula] is absolutely H-closed in the class of topological inverse semigroups.

We define a topology [formula] on the polycyclic monoid Pλ in the following way. All non-zero elements of Pλ are isolated point in [formula]. For an arbitrary finite subset A of [formula] put We put [formula] to be a base of the topology [formula] at zero 0∈Pλ.

We observe that [formula] is a Hausdorff topology on Pλ because [formula] for every non-zero element a- 1b∈Pλ. Also, since [formula] for any [formula], the inversion is continuous in [formula]. Fix an arbitrary a- 1b∈Pλ and any basic neighbourhood UA(0) of zero in [formula]. Let Sb be a set of all suffixes of the word b. Put [formula]. It is obvious that the set B is finite and hence formula ([\ref=eq-5.1]) implies that a- 1b  ·  UB(0)  ⊆  UA(0). Let Sa be a set of all suffixes of the word a. Put [formula]. It is obvious that the set D is finite and hence formula ([\ref=eq-5.1]) implies that UD(0)  ·  a- 1b  ⊆  UA(0). Also UT(0)  ·  UT(0)  ⊆  UA(0) for [formula]. Therefore [formula] is a topological inverse semigroup.

Theorem [\ref=theorem-5.8] and Example [\ref=example-5.11] implies the following corollary.

The topological inverse semigroup [formula] is absolutely H-closed in the class of topological inverse semigroups.

A Hausdorff topological (inverse) semigroup (S,τ) is said to be minimal if no Hausdorff semigroup (inverse) topology on S is strictly contained in τ. If (S,τ) is minimal topological (inverse) semigroup, then τ is called a minimal (inverse) semigroup topology.

Minimal topological groups were introduced independently in the early 1970's by Doïtchinov [\cite=Doitchinov-1972] and Stephenson [\cite=Stephenson-1971]. Both authors were motivated by the theory of minimal topological spaces, which was well understood at that time (cf. [\cite=Berri-Porter-Stephenson-1971]). More than 20 years earlier L. Nachbin [\cite=Nachbin-1949] had studied minimality in the context of division rings, and B. Banaschewski [\cite=Banaschewski-1974] investigated minimality in the more general setting of topological algebras. In [\cite=Gutik-Pavlyk-2005] on the infinite semigroup of λ  ×  λ-matrix units Bλ the minimal semigroup and the minimal semigroup inverse topologies were constructed.

For any infinite cardinal λ, [formula] is the coarsest inverse semigroup topology on Pλ, and hence is minimal inverse semigroup.

The definition of the topology [formula] on Pλ implies that the subsemigroup of idempotents E(Pλ) of the semigroup Pλ is a compact subset of the space [formula]. By Proposition 3.1 of [\cite=Bardyla-Gutik-2016-?] every non zero-element of a semitopological monoid (Pλ,τ) is an isolated point in the space (Pλ,τ). This and above arguments imply that the topology [formula] on Pλ induces the coarsest semigroup topology on the semilattice E(Pλ). Also by Remark 2.6 from [\cite=Jones-Lawson-2014] (also see [\cite=Jones-Lawson-2014], [\cite=Jones-2011] and [\cite=Lawson-1998])we have that every non-zero element of the semilattice E(Pλ) can be represented in the form a- 1a where a are elements of the free monoid [formula], and the semigroup operation on E(Pλ) in this representation is defined by formula ([\ref=eq-5.1]).

Also, we observe that for any topological inverse semigroup S the following maps φ:S  →  E(S) and ψ:S  →  E(S) defines by the formulae φ(x) = xx- 1 and ψ(x) = x- 1x, respectively, are continuous. Since the inverse element of u- 1v in Pλ is equal to v- 1u, we have that [formula], for any finite subset A of the free monoid [formula]. This implies that UA(A)∈τ for every inverse semigroup topology τ on Pλ, where A is an arbitrary finite subset of [formula]. Thus, [formula] is the coarsest inverse semigroup topology on the λ-polycyclic monoid Pλ.

In the next example we construct a topological inverse monoid S which contains the polycyclic monoid [formula] as a dense discrete subsemigroup, i.e., the polycyclic monoid P2 with the discrete topology is not H-closed in the class of topological inverse semigroups. Also, later we assume that the free monoid [formula] is generated by two element p1 and p2.

Let [formula] be the filter on the bicyclic semigroup [formula], generated by the base [formula], where [formula]. We denote

For any element a- 1b of the set A let [formula] be the filter on P2, generated by the base [formula], where [formula]. It is obvious that [formula], where 1 is the unit element of the free monoid [formula].

We extend the binary operation from P2 onto [formula] by the following formulae:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

It is obvious that the subset [formula] with the induced binary operation from S is isomorphic to the semigroup of ω  ×  ω-matrix units Bω and moreover we have that [formula] in T.

We determine a topology τ on the set S in the following way: assume that the elements of the semigroup P2 are isolated points in (S,τ) and the family of the set [formula] is a neighborhood base of the topology τ at the point [formula].

Now we show that so defined binary operation on (S,τ) is continuous.

In case (I) we consider three cases.

If [formula] then we have that [formula] for any positive integer n.

If [formula] then c = eb. We claim that [formula] for any open basic neighbourhood [formula] of the point [formula] in (S,τ). Indeed, if [formula] then x = (pm1c)- 1pk1d for some positive integers m,k > n, and hence we have that

If [formula], then e is the longest suffix of the word a in [formula] which is not equal to the word p1f for some [formula]. This holds when b = pt1c for some positive integer t. We claim that [formula] for any open basic neighbourhood [formula] of the point [formula] in (S,τ). Indeed, if [formula], then x = (pm + t1c)- 1pk + t1d for some positive integers m,k > n, and hence we have that

In case (II) the proof of the continuity of binary operation in (S,τ) is similar to case (I).

Now we consider case (III).

If [formula] then [formula], for any open basic neighbourhoods [formula] and [formula] of the points [formula] and [formula] in (S,τ), respectively.

If [formula] then b = c and for every any open basic neighbourhood [formula] of the point [formula] in (S,τ) we have that [formula]. Indeed if [formula] and [formula] then for some positive integers s,z > n, and hence [formula].

Thus, we proved that the binary operation on (S,τ) is continuous. Taking into account that P2 is a dense subsemigroup of (S,τ) we conclude that (S,τ) is a topological semigroup. Also, since [formula] with the induced binary operation from S is isomorphic to the semigroup of ω  ×  ω-matrix units Bω we have that idempotents in S commute and moreover [formula]. This implies that S is an inverse semigroup. Also, for every open basic neighbourhood [formula] of the point [formula] in (S,τ) we have that [formula] for all [formula] and hence the inversion in (S,τ) is continuous.
