Mass ratio determination from Hα lines in Black-Hole X-ray transients

Introduction

Stellar-mass black holes (BHs) are mostly detected through dramatic X-ray outbursts exhibited by transient X-ray binaries (SXTs; [\citealt=tanaka96]). About 60 BH candidates have been identified in the 50 year lifetime of X-ray astronomy [\citep=corral15], although only 17 of these have been confirmed by dynamical studies i.e. they possess a mass function f(M) = M1 sin 3i  /  (1 + q)2 in excess of 3 M[formula], where q = M2 / M1 is the mass ratio of the companion star to the compact object. The reason for the low rate of confirmed BHs lies in the difficulty of detecting the companion star for quiescent optical magnitudes fainter than ~  22. Time-resolved spectroscopy with signal-to-noise ratio [formula] is typically needed to detect the weak absorption features and trace their orbital motion. Determining the binary mass ratio is even more challenging as it also requires resolving powers [formula] to measure the rotational broadening of the absorption lines (e.g. [\citealt=casares94]). In addition, moderately short integration times are essential to avoid significant orbital smearing. It should be mentioned that alternative methods based on the radial velocities of the disc emission lines are uncertain and prone to large systematic effects (see e.g. [\citealt=marsh94]). A critical review on the determination of system parameters in BH SXTs can be found in [\cite=casares14].

In [\cite=casares15] (henceforth Paper I) we showed that the full-width-half maximum (FWHM) of the disc Hα line in quiescent BH SXTs scales with the velocity semi-amplitude of the companion star. We here present the discovery of a another correlation between q and the ratio of the double peak separation to the line width. Both relations open the door to constrain fundamental parameters and perform dynamical studies in much fainter samples of quiescent BH candidates than is currently possible.

Database

We have selected a sample of quiescent spectra of nine dynamical BH and two neutron star (NS) SXTs from Paper I, all with reliable mass ratio determinations. Only mass ratios obtained by resolving the rotational broadening of the companion star (the V sin i technique) have been considered. Table 1 presents our sample and the associated references. Full observational details for every target are given in Paper I. For the case of XTE J1118+480, we decided to include also 34 additional spectra obtained with the 10.4m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) and reported in [\cite=gonzalez14]. Note that GRO J0422+320 is not included despite having a q determination through the V sin i technique. This is because the resolution of the only three quiescent spectra available to us is too poor (Δλ > 25% of the double peak separation) for a realistic determination of the double peak separation.

For comparison we have also chosen a sub-sample of quiescent Cataclysmic Variables (CVs) from Paper I. From the 24 possible CVs with reliable q determinations, 13 have been rejected because the line core is dominated by a strong S-wave component which prevents us from measuring the double peak separation with the simple model outlined below. In any case, these are all CVs with large mass ratios [formula] which, as we will show later, are not relevant to our analysis. From the remaining 11 CVs, two have q values based on the V sin i technique (GK Per, CTCV J1300-3052) and another two on a direct determination of the radial velocity curves of both the white dwarf and the donor star (U Gem and WZ Sge). In the remaining seven the companion star is not directly observed but robust q values are available through modeling the eclipse of the white dwarf and the hot spot (see e.g. [\citealt=littlefair08]). Our CV sample is listed in Table 2.

The DP / FWHM - q relation

Double peak separations (DP) were obtained by fitting a symmetric 2-Gaussian model to the average Hα profile in every SXT and CV. In the case of eclipsing CVs we excluded those spectra obtained within ±  0.05 phases from the time of the central eclipse. The fitted model consists of a constant plus two Gaussians of identical width and height. The continuum rectified spectra were fitted in a window of ±  10000 km s- 1, centered on the Hα line after masking the neighboring HeI line at λ6678. Prior to the fit, the 2-Gaussian model was degraded to the resolution of the data by convolution with the instrumental profile We adopted 1-σ formal errors on the fitted parameter as derived through χ2 minimization. Fig. 1 displays some fit examples using our 2-Gaussian model. In addition, FWHM values were extracted from single Gaussian fits to the same average Hα profiles following Paper I.

Tables 1 and 2 list the parameter DP / FWHM and its propagated 1-σ error as derived from our Gaussian model fits. The evolution of DP / FWHM with q is presented in Fig. 2. The figure shows that DP / FWHM varies very rapidly for small q values, with a 10% increase for q under 0.2.

In order to understand this behaviour, we follow on from Paper I and start by assuming that the FWHM of the Hα line is determined by gas with Keplerian velocity at a characteristic radius RW  =  αRL1, with α < 1 and RL1 the Roche lobe of the compact star, i.e.

[formula]

On the other hand, the double peak separation is set by the velocity of the outer disc, whose radius Rd is truncated by the tidal forces of the companion star [\citep=paczynski77] [\citep=papaloizou77]. There is ample evidence for the outer disc velocities to be sub-Keplerian (e.g. [\citealt=north02]) and thus we decided to adopt

[formula]

where the parameter β < 1 accounts for the fraction by which the outer disc material is sub-Keplerian. For extreme mass ratios [formula] the disc is effectively truncated at the resonance radius of the (j=3, k=2) commensurability or 3:1 resonance radius i.e. the radius at which the disc angular velocity is three times the angular velocity of the companion star (see [\citealt=hirose90] [\citealt=frank02]). Therefore,

[formula]

where a the binary separation. If we now bring eq. 3 into eq. 2 and use Eggleton's relation [\citep=eggleton83] to remove RL1 / a we find

[formula]

where f(q) is the same expression as in eq. 6 of Paper I, i.e.

[formula]

By computing the ratio between the double peak separation and the line width we have managed to cancel out the dependence on compact object mass and binary inclination. Interestingly, in contrast with the FWHM - K2 correlation presented in Paper I, eq. 4 is very sensitive to the mass ratio for [formula] i.e. the typical values achieved by BH SXTs.

For the sake of comparison, we also plot eq. 4 in Fig. 2 for α = 0.42 (adopted from Paper I) and β = 0.77. Although not intended to be a fit, the alignment of the data with the model indicates that eq. 4 provides a good description of the observations. This endorses our interpretation that the strong dependence of DP / FWHM with q is driven by the truncation of the outer disc radius caused by the 3:1 resonance tide. The bottom panel in Fig. 2 also displays the evolution of DP / FWHM for the CV sample, with the model for α = 0.42 and β = 0.83 superimposed. The comparison of the SXT and CV data with the model indicates that the velocities at the outer accretion disc are sub-Keplerian by ≈  20%, in good agreement with other studies (e.g. [\citealt=wade88]). Note that for [formula] the 3:1 resonance lies beyond ≈  0.9 RL1 and the outer disc radius is then limited by the largest non-intersecting orbits allowed by three-body interactions [\citep=paczynski77]. Under these circumstances, the dependence of the outer disc radius on q is very weak [\citep=frank02] and, therefore, a nearly constant evolution of DP / FWHM versus q is expected for [formula].

For practical purposes, we display in Fig. 3 the variation of DP / FWHM versus q in logarithmic units. A least-squares linear fit yields

[formula]

witha Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0.95. In order to estimate the error in q implied by this relation we have computed the difference with respect to the true observed values for our 11 SXTs. The distribution of differences can be approximated by a normal function with σ(q) = 0.015. This indicates that mass ratios can be realistically obtained from eq. 6 with a typical [formula]% uncertainty.

Orbital effects

The spectra that we have used to produce the DP / FWHM - q correlation are orbital averages. This is party because individual spectra rarely possess enough signal-to-noise for the technique to be applicable. But also, because orbital means average out possible asymmetries in individual spectra from, for example, hot-spots or disc eccentricitiies which could potentially bias the determination of q.

At this point we decided to explore the impact of line asymmetries in the results of our technique. Since this can only be tested on data with sufficient signal-to-noise we have focused on the 154 high quality GTC spectra of XTE J1118+480 obtained along four different orbits over two years. We have performed Gaussian fits on every individual spectrum and computed mass ratios using eq. 6. The distribution of q values is found to peak at q = 0.024 (bottom panel in Fig. 4), with 68% of the values contained between q = 0.021 and 0.045. This indicates that, if q were to be obtained from a single individual spectrum, the typical uncertainty would be about ~  56%.

In order to trace the effect of line asymmetries we also extracted the V / R parameter from each spectrum, with V / R defined as the ratio of equivalent widths between the blue and the red part of the Hα profile. The two halves of the line are set from the rest wavelength till ±  2500 km s- 1. For example, V / R = 0.8 indicates a line with the red part stronger by 20% while V / R = 1 implies a symmetric profile. A plot of q versus V / R (see top panel in Fig. 4) seems to show a trend, with asymmetric profiles preferring slightly lower q values, although the large scatter prevents from drawing a firm conclusion.

However, as we have mentioned above, the technique outlined in this paper is most useful on phase averaged spectra because individual spectra typically have very limited signal-to-noise. Consequently, we have extracted q values by fitting Gaussians to the four orbital averages of the 154 individual spectra. The distribution of q values has a mean at 0.026 and a standard deviation of 0.05, indicating that the typical error on phase averaged spectra is reduced to ~  19% i.e. smaller than the 25% uncertainty drawn from the correlation. We therefore conclude that the uncertainty expected from the application of our technique to phase averaged spectra is about 32%.

Discussion: application to three faint BHs

In Paper I we showed that the FWHM of the Hα line in quiescent SXTs and CVs is formed at ≃42% of RL1. Furthermore, it is tightly correlated with the projected velocity of the donor star K2 and thus, the quantity FWHM / K2 can be used to extract dynamical information from single epoch low resolution ([formula]) spectroscopy. In addition, we showed that FWHM / K2 is weakly dependent on q, resulting in a ~  27% flatter slope for (long-period) CVs.

We here now present a new method to estimate the binary mass ratio in quiescent BH SXTs from the properties of the Hα line. We have proved that the quantity DP / FWHM is strongly dependent on q, with a 10% variation for [formula]. The reason behind this is the efficient truncation of the outer disc radius by the 3:1 tidal resonance of the donor star. The correlation of DP / FWHM with q, therefore, opens a new avenue to measure mass ratios in quiescent BH SXTs. The double peak separation can be solidly measured by fitting a symmetric double-Gaussian model to phase averaged Hα profiles. We estimate that instrumental resolution better than 25% of the double peak separation is required to resolve the latter. This typically demands resolving powers of only [formula]1000 i.e a factor [formula] lower than required to measure q using the V sin i technique. More significantly for observational feasibility, this method makes use of the disc Hα line which, with a typical [formula] Å, is much stronger that the weak atmospheric features of the donor star.

The relations presented in this paper and in Paper I thus allow for a reasonably accurate estimation of the system parameters in very faint SXTs which otherwise cannot be tackled with current instrumentation and standard techniques. As an example, we have applied our method to the BH SXTs XTE J1650-500, XTE J1859+226 and Swift J1357-0933. They all have [formula] and none of them has yet a mass ratio determination. We have produced averaged spectra for XTE J1650-500 and XTE J1859+226 using the data presented in Table 1 of Paper I. Regarding Swift J1357-0933 we have used a more recent and extended database reported in [\cite=mata15]. Fig.5 displays the averaged spectra of the three BHs together with the best double-Gaussian model fits, which result in [formula], 0.5741±  0.0072 and 0.5805±  0.0027 for XTE J1650-500, XTE J1859+226 and Swift J1357-0933 respectively. The mass ratios implied by eq. 6 are q = 0.026+ 0.038- 0.007, 0.049+ 0.023- 0.012 and 0.040+ 0.003- 0.005, respectively. The quoted uncertainties correspond to 68% confidence regions and have been computed using a Monte Carlo simulation with 105 realizations. We note in passing that our mass ratio for Swift J1357-0933 is in excellent agreement with an independent estimate based on the radial velocity curve of the wings of the Hα line [\citep=mata15].

Regarding Swift J1357-0933 we are now in a position to present a credible BH mass based on our scaling relations. By combining our mass ratio with the mass function obtained by means of the FWHM / K2 correlation [\citep=mata15] and a conservative estimate of the inclination angle [formula] [\citep=corral13] [\citep=mata15] we find [formula] M[formula]. This result confirms Swift J1357-0933 as one of the most massive BH low-mass X-ray binaries in the Galaxy, only rivaled by GRS 1915+105 [\citep=reid14].

To conclude we would like to stress that the relations presented here and in Paper I will help deepen the search for new BH transients to substantially fainter limits. They will also prove very useful in extracting fundamental parameters from large numbers of data to be delivered by new spectroscopic surveys such as GAIA or WEAVE.
