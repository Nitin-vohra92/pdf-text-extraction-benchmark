Searching PeV neutrinos from photomeson interactions in magnetars

Introduction

Detection of PeV muon neutrinos (νμ-s) and gamma-rays (γ-rays) produced via hadronic interactions of very high-energy cosmic rays (VHECRs) with ambient gas and radiation in, or surrounding, not yet known cosmic accelerators is expected to reveal the mystery on the origin of CRs. Only a few such detected PeV ν-s can be significant because contribution from atmospheric neutrino flux as background is extremely low in this region. Probable candidates of high-energy γ-rays and ν-s include various extragalactic sources, such as active galactic nuclei (AGNs), gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), or star-burst galaxies. These ν-s can travel over extragalactic distances retaining their directional information unaffected and not experiencing strong absorption. However, the extragalactic PeV γ-ray component will be attenuated significantly due to pair-production processes in cosmic background radiations and no longer remain as important cosmic messengers in order to explore their origin. Efforts have been made to detect such astrophysical ν-s by the 1 km3 IceCube neutrino observatory since the time when data analysis was begun [\citep=hal14]. The IceCube detector observed two high-energy ν-s above 1 PeV satisfying all selection criteria in two years data collection might be of astrophysical origin [\citep=aar13].

The possible potential sources of these PeV ν events have been studying by many, those have been reported in many recent papers and reviews [\citep=lah13] [\citep=aar14] but still remains a topic of much speculation.

Our present article aims to show that the PeV νμ-s could be produced by relatively young local neutron stars with strong magnetic fields (B  ~  1014 - 16 G) widely known as magnetars. The model dependent calculation of PeV νμ flux from magnetars limits the upper bound on the γ-ray flux at these energies.

Recently identified magnetar candidates are traditionally known to be either anomalous X-ray pulsar (AXPs) or soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs), mainly considered as high-energy X-ray emitters [\citep=ola14] [\citep=mer13]. Like pulsars [\citep=lin05] [\citep=lin06] [\citep=bha09], it has been learned that if magnetars polar caps with   <  0 can accelerate protons/ions, TeV ν-s and γ-rays could be produced via photo-meson productions due to interactions between accelerated protons and UV/X-radiations close to polar caps regardless of their relatively slow rotations [\citep=zha03].

The magnetar spin period (P) versus B, the phase diagram in [\citep=zha03], indicates that the star could be neutrino-loud for some suitable set of parameters those characterizing its evolution. In this paper, we have shown that if the spin-down power of a local magnetar for a favorable set of P and B values corresponding to a evolutionary phase is consumed to accelerate protons/ions, then these objects may emit PeV νμ-s and γ-rays by photo-meson interactions between such accelerated protons/ions in polar caps and surrounding radiation. The ambient radiation field is believed to be filled mainly with soft ultraviolet (UV)-A or B photons produced from hard UV-C radiation in ultra-strong magnetic fields. This is much worthy to note that this type of magnetars have not yet been reported from observation, predicted theoretically only [\citep=zha03].

This paper is organized as follows. In the next Sect., we provide an overview of the basic model following its detailed description, and obtain required expressions for the expected flux of νμ-s/γ-rays that results from the model, with numerical values for a typical magnetar. In sect. III, the possible implications of the photon splitting process to the modification of the low and high energy electromagnetic spectra is discussed. A brief discussion of the prospects for detection of such high-energy νμ-s and γ-rays by the present (IceCube) and future experiments is given in Sect. IV. In Sect. V, we summarize our conclusions.

Emission of PeV neutrinos and gamma-rays

Photomeson production

There has been an unanimity among researchers in particle astrophysics over half a century that VHE protons and/or heavier ions emitted by cosmic accelerators (e.g. pulsars, supernovae remnants, young magnetars) are affected by the presence of the ambient matter or radiation fields. Consequent upon, these sources would generate ν-s via dominant photo-meson interaction in the ambient radiation zone through the reactions given below:

[formula]

The final products of all ν flavours along with γ-ray keep the ratio approximately as νe:νμ:ντ:γ  =  1:2:0:2 at the sources but the process of neutrino oscillation turns this into a ratio of νe:νμ:ντ:γ  =  1:1:1:2 while observing at earth.

In magnetar's early life, the spin-down power is consumed to accelerate protons/ions, and the magnetic field driven power supplies ambient photon targets. The kinematic threshold for photo-meson interaction process in (A) is determined by the accessible photon energies in the radiation field. For ambient photons mostly are ultra-violet (UV), as characteristic of many stars (pulsars, nebulae, accreting objects), the proton's kinetic energy has to range in the few tens to hundreds of PeV.

For common magnetars the surface magnetic field is of the order of 1015 G, the γ  -  γ pair production (or photon splitting) process due to γ  -  B interaction starts in the magnetosphere where the magnetic field reduces into the magnitude of ~  1012 G. For such slowly rotating objects the high-energy emission is described by the outer gap model [\citep=che86]. In this gap closure scenario these class of magnetars exhibit γ-ray energy degradation with almost zero detectability to direct observation like Fermi-LAT [\citep=ton10].

It is clear that the principal effect of the exotic photon splitting process is responsible to lower photon energies estimated at any distant point from some astrophysical accelerators with extreme physical conditions [\citep=chi12]. But in the present work it has been suggested and believed that in a magnetar the exotic process may also degrade energies of ambient photons in the star's radiation zone along with conventional pair-production loss i.e. γ  →  e+e-. Though in [\citep=chi12], photon splitting process was studied around εγ  ~  0.51 MeV but its effect in pure magnetic field might be significant at low energy (εγ <  < mec2). If so, a main fraction of the UV photons (0.2  -  0.4 KeV) of the ambient field may convert into a low energy radiation comprising chiefly by UV-A and UV-B types with average photon energy ≈  0.01 keV. Interaction of VHE protons with this modified UV radiation field through photo-meson process in the open field line zone of the magnetosphere will generate PeV ν-s and γ-rays that will be detected on earth.

Physical model and photo-meson threshold

For young pulsars/magnetars with a large spin-down power, acceleration of protons/ions has been considered by the widely used polar cap [\citep=rud75] [\citep=aro79] [\citep=har98] and outer gap models [\citep=che86] inside the magnetosphere. More clearly, charged particles undergo acceleration in the open field line zone near the magnetar's pole in the polar cap model whereas in the later model it takes place in the empty gaps within the bounded region by the neutral and last open lines in the magnetosphere.

The neutron star (NS) remnant or merger that appears from massive binary NSs ([formula]) coalescence, may form a millisecond magnetar with thin ejecta walls across polar caps in its very early phase. As the star receives huge angular momentum from the binary it possesses a rapid rotation at the moment of its birth. Such magnetars have also super-strong magnetic fields [\citep=zra13] [\citep=dan92]. However, formation of a prompt black hole from the merging can't provide such a spin-down driven energy injection. On the other hand, detection of quiescent emission and flares from some magnetars (normally as slow rotators with P  ~  5  -  12s) can only be interpreted in terms of magnetic field driven power [\citep=dan92] [\citep=tho95]. Here, we suggest that in the evolutionary phase of a magnetar that appears from NSs merger, may transit a state when spin-down power is comparable with its magnetic power and spin period falls in the range 200  -  500 ms [\citep=zha03]. At these times the magnetar may induce photo-meson process in the polar cap which in turn produces PeV ν-s and γ-rays.

Generally, the spin down power induces strong electric fields where particles those coming out from the polar cap will experience acceleration, and directed towards the open field lines near the star's pole. The ultimate limit of potential drop of a magnetar with angular velocity Ω  =  2π / P corresponding to the induced electric field across the magnetic field lines from the magnetic pole to the last line that extends to infinity is Δφ  =  BSR3Ω2 / 2c2 [\citep=gol69] where R is the radius of the magnetar, BS is the strength of magnetic field at star's surface, and c is the speed of light. In the present work the evolutionary phase of a magnetar is considered to be nearly analogous to a young pulsar except its magnetic field intensity ([formula] G) and existence of γ  -  γ pair cascades in addition to e+ - e- pairs. The magnitude of the potential drop would be huge with a value of 7  ×  1021B15P- 2ms volts. In polar cap model of magnetar, presence of e+ - e- pair cascades in the strong magnetic field would tumble the electric field slightly in comparison with pulsars along field lines due to screening effect. The presence of such e+ - e- pair cascades were validated by the results obtained from the observation of the crab and other pulsar wind nebulae (PWN) but our present understanding on various aspects of the cascade formation is still incomplete that needs more research.

An extension of previous calculations for young pulsars by [\cite=lin05] and [\cite=lin06] to magnetars, it reveals that protons or heavier ions undergo acceleration near the magnetar's surface by polar caps to energies nearly at 1016  -  1017 eV when the magnetar's magnetic moment vector [formula] and [formula] parameter satisfy the strong condition, . < 0. These VHE protons will interact with soft UV-A and UV-B photons close to the magnetar's surface, the Δ resonance state may occur satisfying the kinematic threshold condition for process (A). The photo-meson production threshold for a proton to reach the Δ+ state is something where the kinetic energies of the proton (εp) and UV-A/B photon (εγ) would satisfy

[formula]

where θpγ is the incident angle between the proton and photon as measured in the laboratory frame. In a young magnetar, the typical photon energies near the surface are much smaller than a young pulsar because of intense magnetic field, with values 2.8kT∞(1 + zg)  ~  0.01 keV, where zg ~  0.4 being the gravitational red shift. This implies that the proton threshold energy εp,Th for the Δ+ resonance state lies at [formula] eV.

The ion/proton flux interact in the UV radiation zone

Since one may expect that the approximate ion injection rate around the equatorial sector is the Goldreich-Julian rate [\citep=gal94] and hence for a quasi-static magnetospheric environment the charge density near magnetar surface can be approximated to ρq≃eZno when the Goldreich-Jullian density of ions at a radial distance r is equated to [formula] [\citep=gol69]. There must be charge depleted gaps above stellar surface to induce acceleration where the density of ions may be parametrized as fd(1 - fd)no, with fd (  <  1 for modest depletion) is the depletion factor depending on adopted models and is unreliable one. The VHE proton flux emitted from the polar cap region would therefore be

[formula]

where APC denotes polar cap area and it is ηA(4πR2) in which ηA accounts the ratio of polar cap area to the magnetar surface area. Earlier calculations in [\citep=lin05] [\citep=lin06], for estimating proton/ion flux in pulsar's polar caps took the parameter ηA as unity. The characteristic polar cap radius can be given by rPC = R(ΩR / c)1 / 2, and hence ηA takes the form ΩR / (4c) [\citep=bes93].

The neutrino and gamma-ray fluxes on earth

It is seen from the process in (A) that charge-changing reaction goes on just [formula]-rd of the reaction time, about three high-energy ν (or a pair of νμ,) will accompany with four high-energy γ-rays when a significant number of such reactions proceed successfully. The νμ-s and γ-rays those are produced from charged and neutral pions via Δ resonance will be moving in nearly the original direction of protons. These ν will arrive at earth without a change in flux and energy whereas the high-energy γ-rays flux might suffer a change due to QED effects in presence of strong magnetic field in magnetar's magnetosphere. Suppose, the factor fs accounts such reduction in flux.

In the UV-A/B dominated radiation field of magnetar where accelerated ions by a polar cap will suffer interaction. For a young magnetar with surface temperature T∞, the UV-C photon density in the vicinity to the star surface area is [formula], aSB being the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. A numerical value of nγ(R) could be approximated as 9  ×  1019T30.1  keV (close to R, T0.1  keV  ~  0.5). The photon density increases due to splitting and at the same time will decrease with the increase of radial distance from the stellar surface, and we assume here that these two variations will keep the overall photon density nearly constant not much distance away from the star's surface. The UV-C type photon spectra will reduce into UV-A/B spectra only. Now, the conversion probability for p  →  Δ+ via UV-A/B interaction along the distance from R to r is given by (LB) Pc(r) = 1  -  P(r), where dP / P(r) =  - nγ(r)σpγdr≃ - nγ(R)σpγdr with εγ  ~  0.01 keV, and conversion to continue in the range from ~  R to 1.2R. The threshold level εp,Th for Δ+ production in p - UV(A/B) interaction according to the equation (1) increases rapidly with r because of the angle factor (1 - cosθpγ)- 1. The conversion probability can be parametrized as Pc≃T30.1  keV using modified radiation zone temperature [\citep=lin06]. Therefore, very near to the upper bound of the p  →  Δ+ transformation region, the total flux of ν-s/γ-rays coming out from the disintegration of Δ+ resonance state is

[formula]

with fξ is 4 / 3 and 2 / 3 for γ-rays and νμs respectively. If now the duty cycle factor fdc of the γ-ray/νμ is taken into account, the phase averaged γ-ray/νμ on the Earth from a magnetar at a distance D is given by

[formula]

In equation (4), the flavor ratio of ν at their production center to a very large distance like at a detection level on earth is different due to well known ν oscillation, and the effect is represented by the parameter fζ ( 1/2 and 1 for νμ's and γ-rays whereas fs is 1 for νμ but not yet known correctly for γ-rays). The factor of 2 in equation (3) or (4)arises due to [formula] production in the process (A).

The efficiency of the dynamo process in young magnetars is partly defined by the initial angular speed Ωi  =  2π / Pi. The associated analytical calculations suggest that the creation of such enormous magnetic field needs rotational period with Pi  ~  1 ms at birth time [\citep=dan92]. Under such a circumstance stars possess huge rotational energy for a small period before transforming into other class of stars through rapid evolutions. But, in this work we have taken < P >  as ~  350 ms so that the magnetar may just transit in the neutrino-loud regime during its evolutionary phase [\citep=zha03].

As an example, we calculate numerical values for νμ and γ-ray fluxes from the model prediction for a typical galactic magnetar with D  ~  2 kpc, P  ~  350 ms, B15  ~  1.5, T0.1keV  ~  0.0255, and fdc  ≤  0.10 in both the cases when ηA is equal to (i) 1 and (ii) ΩR / (4c) . However, the factor fs in the expression (4) is considered to be ~  1 now. We have taken star radius simply equal to R  =  10 km for the present calculation. For the purpose, we choose Z  =  1 and fd  =  1 / 2 here.

The corresponding νμ and γ-ray fluxes (E2φνμ  /  γ) calculated out from the eqn.(4) are 6.03  ×  10- 10 and 48.34  ×  10- 10 for ηA  =  1 while these values are 0.0009  ×  10- 10 and 0.007  ×  10- 10 according to the case (ii) in GeVcm- 2s- 1. If compared with IceCube measurements, these predicted values are quite low when more accurate ηA corresponding to case (ii) has been used in the calculation.

The neutrino and gamma-ray energies

The average percentage of proton energy converted to the pion in the photo-meson process is ~  20%, or in terms of temperature the pion energy would be ~  200  ×  T- 10.1  keV TeV [\citep=lin05]. Since the pion resides only a very short time in the dense UV radiation zone and hence suffers negligible energy loss through inverse Compton scattering. Subsequently pion decay occurs and [formula]-th of its energy will be transferred into νμ, the rest will equally be shared by the other three leptons. Average energy of the νμ for a young magnetar with T0.1  keV  ~  0.0255 is therefore

[formula]

On the other hand, the average energy of γ-rays is expected to be

[formula]

But, the resulting γ-ray energy is expected to be smaller than what was obtained from the model prediction due to QED phenomenon in the region around 1.2R stellar distance where magnetic field intensity is approaching to Bcr.  ≈  4.4  ×  1013 G in a magnetar. This energy degradation aspect of γ-rays is discussed in Sect. III. It should be mentioned that in this calculation loss due to pion curvature process is considered inefficient [\citep=her08].

Photon splitting process in the magnetosphere

The photon splitting, a QED process that splits a high-energy photon into pair of low energy photons in presence of a pure magnetic field and/or magnetized plasma. The effect leaves some important signatures in astrophysical environments e.g. magnetars, gamma-ray bursts etc. where magnetic fields approaching or even exceeding the quantum critical value, Bcr  =  4.41  ×  1013 G. Indication of spectral cutoffs in the emergent γ-ray spectra of soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs) and the radio quiescence of SGRs and anomalous x-ray pulsars (AXPS) could be explained by the exotic process under consideration [\citep=bar95] [\citep=tho95]

Generally, in a strongly magnetized plasma or vacuum, two more competing processes such as photon merging and Compton scattering may onset along with the photon splitting [\citep=har97] [\citep=chi12]. No detailed calculation on the probabilities of these processes in the current scenario (B  >  Bcr with plasma) is available except a numerical calculation used in [\citep=chi12]. The photon splitting rate could be affected considerably by the magnetized plasma. The environment effects the rate by changing photo dispersion properties of the region. The ambient radiation zone in the vicinity of a magnetar can be approximated to an environment with magnetized rarefied plasma (inclusion of γ  -  γ pairs in combination with e+  -  e- pairs in super-strong field). On the other hand, the region in the magnetar magnetosphere where high-energy γ-rays and ν's are emitted is considered to be a strong magnetized vacuum i.e. environment without plasma.

Photon splitting may occur via various channels which are determined by the electric field vector ([formula]), momentum vector ([formula]) associated with a photon, and the magnetic field vector ([formula]). The state '1' refers to a configuration where [formula] is perpendicular to the plane containing [formula] and [formula] while '2' corresponds the [formula] being parallel to their plane. For low energy ambient radiation zone UV-C photons ([formula] keV <  < mec2) the only physical mode γ1  →  γ2  +  γ2 is responsible for splitting and, thereby soften photon spectra in the magnetized plasma [\citep=chi12]. In addition the photon merging channel γ2  +  γ2  →  γ1 also plays an important role in the attenuation and softening of photons. But in the absence of plasma the physical mode γ1  →  γ1  +  γ2 is the significant one for photon splitting over the channel γ1  →  γ2  +  γ2. It should be mentioned that the influence of the Compton scattering has negligible effect on softening of radiation field photons against photon splitting in magnetar model.

In magnetar model, conversion of π0 into γ-rays generally occurs near the magnetic vacuum region of the magnetosphere where the magnetic field intensity touches or even goes below the Bcr. Consequently, the influence of the main exotic process γ1  →  γ1  +  γ2 on the modification of the emergent γ-ray spectra in such a pure magnetic field is essentially none. Therefore, in this work, the factor fs that is present in the expression of γ-ray flux is approximated to 1 in both the cases with or without consideration of QED effects.

PeV neutrino events in IceCube

Detection of two neutrino events with energies between 1 - 10 PeV reported recently by IceCube [\citep=aar13]. These high-energy νμ-s are usually detected indirectly through the observation of the Cherenkov light produced in ice by charged secondary particles created from neutral-current or charged-current interactions. The visible track length leaving behind the path of a produced high-energy μ is estimated from the reconstruction of the Cherenkov light detected by optical sensors buried in the Antarctic ice in configuration with the digital optical modules. Events with angular resolution ≤  1o, 50% confidence level correspond visible muon tracks out of all events [\citep=aara14]. Event selection for astrophysical neutrinos from backgrounds mostly arising from VHECR air shower induced muons is implemented through Monte Carlo simulations [\citep=abb13] [\citep=aarb13]. Here, the probability of conversion of νμ   →   μ in ice is expected to be [formula] [\citep=gai95], and corresponding event rates in IceCube detector would be

[formula]

For observing TeV γ-rays the imaging air Cherenkov telescopes and air fluorescence detectors have been used in many experiments [\citep=abra10]. High-energy γ-rays might also be detected by ground based air-shower arrays equipped with muon detectors [\citep=gup05]. The High-altitude water Cherenkov (HAWC) observatory has been dedicated to observe very high energy γ-rays [\citep=abe12]. The upcoming high sensitive Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) [\citep=ach13] would provide a good chance to observe γ-rays up to few PeV energies. Under present perspective of the work, the simultaneous observation of νμs and γ-rays in the PeV range has to be ensured in IceCube experiment [\citep=gup13]. Presently the surface component of IceCube namely the IceTop containing an array of Cherenkov detecting large water tanks has started data analysis to give preliminary results with relatively less sensitivity [\citep=aarc13].

The daughter particles from pγ interactions are ν-s, γ-rays, degraded protons and neutrons. Among them protons may remain trapped in star's magnetic field and neutrons will decay and results into CRs. Hence these components cannot reach on earth uninterrupted due to various interactions and deflections in the interstellar medium, and thereby obscuring directional information completely. In each such pγ interaction, VHE protons lose about 20% of their initial energy from which νμ and γ-ray gain ~  5% of the proton energy each. This suggests a possibility of simultaneous detections of PeV ν-s and γ-rays from magnetars on earth if the γ-rays escape the emission region without making pairs (more likely since mean free path for e+ - e- pair production is ≥  10 kpc [\citep=pro96]). Upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) and high sensitive Icecube experiments in future may detect these PeV γ-rays [\citep=aarc13] [\citep=ach13]. These PeV γ-rays are unlikely to reach at detection site from extragalactic sources because of their pair-production losses with cosmic background radiations. Hence, results from CTA on the VHE γ-ray component and the simultaneous investigation for PeV ν-s and γ-rays by the ongoing Icecube with higher sensitivity in future will resolve the enigma on the origin of PeV γ-rays.

Conclusions

If protons reach 10  -  100 PeV energy scale in a magnetar then their interactions with modified UV-A/B photons may generate PeV neutrino events with energies between 1  -  10 PeV as observed by the IceCube experiment. The predicted event rates of PeV neutrinos by the model suggest no possible indication of any statistically significant excess from the direction of any local magnetar to be observed by IceCube in near future and is thus as per IceCube expectations [\citep=aard14].

Since the process of photon splitting in the PeV region is not studied yet in QED, and if PeV γ-rays might have generated in the magnetosphere where B  >  Bcr., then one cannot rule out the modification of the PeV γ-ray spectra detected at earth from magnetars.

If γ-rays are detected simultaneously with ν-s at PeV energies then the origin of PeV astrophysical ν-s would probably be resolved.
