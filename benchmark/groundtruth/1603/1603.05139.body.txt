Cellularity of hermitian K-theory and Witt-theory

Introduction

The notion of a cellular object in motivic homotopy theory is intrinsically linked to the geometry of motivic spheres Sp,q [\cite=MR2153114]. Suppose the smooth scheme X admits a filtration by closed subschemes where [formula] is a disjoint union of affine spaces [formula]. Examples of such filtrations arise in the context of Białynicki-Birula decompositions for [formula]-action on smooth projective varieties [\cite=MR0366940], cf. [\cite=MR2178658] for a more recent implementation. By homotopy purity [\cite=MR1813224] for Thom spaces of normal bundles of closed embeddings, there is a homotopy cofiber sequence By assumption the normal bundle Ni is trivial. Thus the splitting [formula] and the two-out-of-three property for stably cellular objects [\cite=MR2153114] imply inductively that X is stably cellular in the sense of [\cite=MR2153114].

In this paper we employ a similar strategy to prove cellularity for Thom spaces of direct sums of tautological sympletic bundles over quaternionic Grassmannians. This allows us to show cellularity of the motivic spectra representing hermitian K-theory and Witt-theory [\cite=MR2122220]. By a base scheme we mean any regular noetherian separated scheme of finite Krull dimension.

Suppose all points on the base scheme have residue characteristic unequal to two. Then hermitian K-theory [formula] and Witt-theory [formula] are cellular motivic spectra.

For a related antecedent result showing cellularity of algebraic K-theory, see [\cite=MR2153114]. The proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem:KQcellular] exploits the geometry of quaternionic Grassmannians and the explicit model for hermitian K-theory from [\cite=panin-walterKO].

Recent applications of [formula] and [formula] concern computations of stable homotopy groups of motivic spheres [\cite=MR2061856], [\cite=MR3255457], [\cite=roendigs-spitzweck-oestvaer.1line], and a proof of the Milnor conjecture on quadratic forms [\cite=roendigs-oestvaer.hermitian]. For cellular motivic spectra one has the powerful fact that stable motivic weak equivalences are detected by [formula]-isomorphisms [\cite=MR2153114]. Our main motivation for proving Theorem [\ref=theorem:KQcellular] is that it is being used in the computation of the slices of [formula] in [\cite=roendigs-spitzweck-oestvaer.1line]. In terms of motivic cohomology with integral and mod-2 coefficients, the result is In turn, this is an essential ingredient in our proof of Morel's π1-conjecture in [\cite=roendigs-spitzweck-oestvaer.1line]. It is an interesting problem to make sense of Theorem [\ref=theorem:KQcellular] without any assumptions on the points of the base scheme.

This short paper is organized into Section [\ref=section:cellularobjects] on basic properties of motivic cellular spectra, Section [\ref=section:quaternionicGrassmannians] on the geometry of quaternionic Grassmannians, and Section [\ref=section:hermitianKtheoryandWitttheory] on hermitian K-theory and Witt-theory.

Cellular objects

The subcategory of cellular spectra in the motivic stable homotopy category is the smallest full localizing subcategory that contains all suspensions of the sphere spectrum, cf. [\cite=MR2153114]. For our purposes it suffices to know four basic facts about cellular motivic spectra. First we recall part (3) of Definition 2.1 in [\cite=MR2153114].

The homotopy colimit of a diagram of cellular motivic spectra is cellular.

The second fact is a specialization of [\cite=MR2153114].

Let E be a motivic spectrum and let p, q be integers. Then E is cellular if and only if its (p,q)-suspension Σp,qE is cellular.

The third fact is a specialization of [\cite=MR2153114].

If E  →  F  →  G is a homotopy cofiber sequence of motivic spectra such that any two of E, F, and G are cellular, then so is the third.

Finally, we recall Lemma 3.2 in [\cite=MR2153114].

If Ei is a cellular motivic spectrum for all i∈I, then [formula] is cellular.

Quaternionic Grassmannians

The quaternionic Grassmannian [formula] is the open subscheme of the ordinary Grassmannian [formula] parametrizing 2r-dimensional subspaces of the trivial vector bundle [formula] on which the standard symplectic form is nondegenerate. It is smooth affine of dimension 4r(n - r) over the base scheme. Let Ur,n be short for the tautological symplectic subbundle of rank 2r on [formula]. It is the restriction to [formula] of the tautological subbundle of [formula] together with the restriction to Ur,n of the standard symplectic form on [formula].

More generally, to every symplectic bundle (E,φ) one associates the quaternionic Grassmannian [formula]; it is the open subscheme of the Grassmannian [formula] parametrizing 2r-dimensional subspaces of the fibers of E on which φ is nondegenerate. Associated to the trivial rank 2n - 2 symplectic bundle (E,ψ) is the bundle [formula] equipped with the direct sum of ψ and the hyperbolic symplectic form, i.e.,

[formula]

For simplicity we write [formula] for [formula] and likewise for F.

The normal bundle N of the embedding [formula] is the tensor product [formula] for the dual of the tautological symplectic subbundle of rank 2r on [formula]. Theorem 4.1 in [\cite=panin-walterGP] shows that N is naturally isomorphic to an open subscheme of [formula] and there is a decomposition [formula]; here, [formula] and [formula] have intersection [formula]. Thus there are natural vector bundle isomorphisms [formula] and the normal bundle N of N+ in [formula] is isomorphic to [formula] for the bundle projection [formula]. Moreover, there is a vector bundle isomorphism between the restriction Ur,n|N+ of Ur,n to N+ and [formula]. For r  ≤  n - 1, let Y denote the complement of N+ in [formula] [\cite=panin-walterGP].

For m  ≥  0 the suspension spectrum of the Thom space of the vector bundle [formula] on [formula] is a finite cellular spectrum. In particular, [formula] is a cellular spectrum.

The proof proceeds by a double induction argument on r and n  ≥  r. The base cases [formula] and [formula] are clear, so we may assume 0 < r < n. Define the motivic space Z by the homotopy cofiber sequence

[formula]

According to [\cite=MR2771593] there is a canonical isomorphism in the motivic homotopy category

[formula]

Using the above we note [formula] and hence there are canonical isomorphisms

[formula]

By induction hypothesis Σ∞Z is a finite cellular spectrum. Thus Lemma [\ref=lemma:homotopycofibersequence] and [\eqref=equation:homotopycofibersequence] reduce the proof to showing that [formula] is a finite cellular spectrum. To this end we recall parts of Theorem 5.1 in [\cite=panin-walterGP]: There exists maps where gi and q are Zariski locally trivial torsors over vector bundles of rank 2r - i and 4n - 3, respectively. Moreover, [formula] is isomorphic to [formula]. Invoking [\cite=MR1813224] this implies the canonical isomorphisms

[formula]

Here, the suspension spectrum of [formula] is finite cellular by the induction hypothesis. This finishes the proof using Lemma [\ref=lemma:suspensioncellular].

Hermitian K-theory and Witt-theory

In this section we finish the proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem:KQcellular] stated in the introduction.

The quaternionic plane [formula] is the first quaternionic Grassmannian [formula]. In the pointed unstable motivic homotopy category, [formula] is isomorphic to the two-fold smash product of the Tate object [formula]. It follows that the [formula]-mapping cone [formula] of the rational point [formula] is isomorphic to [formula]. Hence the stable homotopy category of [formula]-spectra is equivalent to the standard model for the stable motivic homotopy category [\cite=panin-walterKO].

Theorem 12.3 in [\cite=panin-walterKO] shows there is an isomorphism between hermitian K-theory [formula] and an [formula]-spectrum [formula]. For n odd, [formula] [\cite=panin-walterKO]. Here [formula] denotes the infinite quaternionic Grassmannian, i.e., the sequential colimit

[formula]

We note that the transition maps in the colimit are defined in [\cite=panin-walterKO]. The motivic space [formula] is pointed by [formula]. Thus [formula] is isomorphic to the homotopy colimit

[formula]

It remains to show cellularity of [\eqref=equation:KQcolimit]. Note that [formula] is a homotopy colimit of cellular spectra by Lemma [\ref=lemma:disjointcellular] and Proposition [\ref=proposition:finitecellular]. It follows that [formula] is cellular according to Lemmas [\ref=lemma:colimitcellular] and [\ref=lemma:suspensioncellular]. We conclude the proof for [formula] by applying Lemma [\ref=lemma:colimitcellular].

Cellularity of [formula] follows from that of [formula] via Lemma [\ref=lemma:colimitcellular] and the description of [formula] as the homotopy colimit of the diagram given in [\cite=ananyevskiy.sl]. Here, η is the first stable Hopf map induced by the canonical map [formula].
