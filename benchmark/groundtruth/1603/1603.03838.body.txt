A note on smoothing properties of the Bergman projection

Introduction

Let Ω be a bounded domain in [formula]. The Bergman projection BΩ is the orthogonal projection operator from the space of square integrable functions L2(Ω) onto the closed subspace of square integrable holomorphic functions A2(Ω). The boundedness of BΩ on other function spaces is of considerable interest and it has deep connections with the geometry of the domain. For example, if Ω is strongly pseudoconvex then the projection operator is bounded on all Lp-Sobolev spaces Wp,k(Ω) for all p∈(1,  ∞  ) and k  ≥  0 [\cite=PhoSte]. On the other hand, if the operator BΩ is bounded on all L2-Sobolev spaces Wk(Ω) for k  ≥  0 then any biholomoprhic map from a smooth Ω to another smoothly bounded pseudoconvex domain extends smoothly to the closure of domains [\cite=Bell].

The Bergman projection preserves holomorphic functions and hence the holomorphic Sobolev space at each scale. Therefore, one can not expect any gain in the Sobolev scale under BΩ. However, in two recent papers [\cite=HerMcN] and [\cite=HerMcNStr] the authors have shown that BΩ gains derivatives in certain directions on a class of bounded pseudoconvex domains. Out of a few different formulations of this gain, we highlight the following version. A domain Ω satisfies condition R if BΩ maps the space of functions smooth up to the boundary [formula] to itself.

We note that even when the function f does not belong to any Sobolev space Wk(Ω) for k > 0, the projection BΩ automatically lands in all Wk(Ω). In other words, on such domains the Bergman projection BΩ smoothens conjugate holomorphic functions.

Moreover, the following observation on complete Reinhardt domains suggests a further smoothing may hold. On such a domain Ω, BΩ is a constant for f∈A2(Ω). This follows from {zα / cα} forming an orthonormal basis for A2(Ω). Consequently, not only is BΩ smooth up to the boundary, it is, in fact, holomorphic on a larger domain (actually holomorphic on [formula]). This example suggests that BΩ may have a further smoothing property and we indeed prove such a result on a family of Reinhardt domains.

Let [formula] be a bounded Reinhardt domain such that [formula] does not intersect the coordinate axes. Then, for every f∈A2(Ω), BΩ extends holomorphically to a (strictly) larger log-convex Reinhardt domain.

In contrast to the result of Herbig, McNeal, and Straube, the above theorem describes a new phenomenon on a different class of domains. Even on smooth Reinhardt domains which satisfy condition R (see [\cite=Boas84] [\cite=Straube86]), our result draws a stronger conclusion. Note that on any smooth bounded domain there exists a holomorphic function that is smooth up to the boundary and does not extend past any boundary point [\cite=Catlin80]. Furthermore, it is not known whether condition R holds on the domains we consider without smoothness of the boundary.

Our main tool in proving this result is observing it in the special case of a product of annuli in [formula]. We show this in Proposition [\ref=prop:ExtnProdAnn] and this can be rephrased as the following local smoothing property. Once we prove the local statement, the global version follows from a patching argument.

Let [formula] be a Reinhardt domain and P  ⊂  Ω be a product of annuli such that [formula] does not intersect the coordinate axes. Then, for every f∈A2(Ω), BΩ extends holomorphically past [formula].

In the next section, we go over some basic facts about the Bergman projection and some examples that lead into the main theorem. We prove the main statements in Section [\ref=sec:MainThmPf]. We conclude with some further remarks in the last section.

Setup and Examples

Basic Setup

In this section, we focus on bounded Reinhardt domains. Let Ω be a bounded Reinhardt domain in [formula]; that is, if z∈Ω and |t| = 1 then tz∈Ω. We denote the Hilbert space of square integrable functions with respect to the Lebesgue measure dV by L2(Ω). The subspace of holomorphic functions in L2(Ω) is called the Bergman space and it is denoted by A2(Ω). It follows from the mean value property of holomorphic functions that A2(Ω) is a closed subspace of L2(Ω). Hence, there exists an orthogonal projection operator from L2(Ω) onto A2(Ω) and it is called the Bergman projection BΩ.

The set (or a subset) of monomials [formula] forms an orthogonal basis for A2(Ω). Let [formula]. Then, the set [formula] forms an orthonormal basis for the Bergman space. It turns out that A2(Ω) is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space and we have the following representation for the Bergman kernel by using this orthonormal basis,

[formula]

and the Bergman projection is the integral operator associated to this kernel,

[formula]

for any f∈L2(Ω). We refer to [\cite=KrantzBook] for more on the basics of the Bergman projection.

Originally defined only on L2(Ω), it is known that BΩ is a bounded operator on other function spaces under various geometric conditions. We refer to [\cite=BoasStraubeSurvey] for a survey of results on Sobolev spaces and to [\cite=McNSte94] [\cite=ZeytuncuTran] and the references therein for a sample of results on Lp spaces.

Examples

We begin by studying a motivating example - an annulus in [formula]. An elementary calculation yields that the Bergman projection of a conjugate holomorphic function in L2 extends holomorphically to a larger domain. For 0  ≤  r < R, let [formula] denote the annulus [formula].

Let [formula] for 0 < r < 1. Then, [formula] is holomorphic extends holomorphically to [formula].

For [formula], let [formula] so that {zj / cj} is an orthonormal basis for [formula]. Let us use the Laurent expansion [formula] of [formula] to compute [formula].

[formula]

since, for [formula],

[formula]

Calculating the cj's and organizing the terms suitably yields

[formula]

The conclusion follows by noting that the middle term converges (uniformly absolutely on compact subsets of) on [formula] and the last term on [formula].

A simple scaling argument gives us the following generalization.

Let [formula] for 0 < r < R. Then, [formula] extends holomorphically to [formula].

If we consider an annulus with inner radius 0, that is, the punctured disc, we are in a rather simple situation where the Bergman projection of an L2 conjugate holomorphic function is a constant; in particular, an entire function.

The following example of the Hartogs' triangle, in which the origin is in the closure of the domain, however, presents a much subtler picture. The global version of the main theorem fails to hold whereas the local version holds everywhere except at the origin. This highlights the importance of the assumption that [formula] not intersect the coordinate axes in Theorem [\ref=thm:Main].

Main Theorem and its Proof

We begin with a proposition that proves the main theorem for a product of annuli. We will use this result to prove the local version of the main theorem which in turn is used to prove the main theorem.

Let [formula] be a product of annuli such that [formula] does not intersect the coordinate axes.

Then, there exists a product of annuli [formula] such that

[formula],

[formula] does not intersect the coordinate axes, and

for every f∈A2(P), BP∈A2(P'). i.e., there exists F∈A2(P') such that [formula].

Let [formula] be any product of annuli such that [formula] and [formula] does not intersect the coordinate axes. We will place further restrictions on P' to ensure that it satisfies the other conclusions in the statement.

For [formula], let [formula] and [formula] so that {zα / cα} and {zα / dα} are orthonormal bases for A2(P) and A2(P') respectively. Let [formula]. Then,

[formula]

and hence

[formula]

Since [formula], it suffices to choose P' so that dα  ≤  c-  αc2α for all [formula]. That is, we need to find P' so that the following holds:

[formula]

for all [formula] and some C > 0 which is independent of α.

Since P and P' are products of annuli, we will be done if we show the following: given an annulus [formula] there exists an annulus [formula] such that [formula], [formula], and the pair [formula] and [formula] satisfy the above inequality. Suppose [formula] for some 0 < r < R. Then, one can check that [formula] satisfies the above criteria for any r' and R' satisfying

[formula]

This is in agreement with the conclusion of Corollary [\ref=cor:GenAnnExtn] which guaranteed holomorphic extension of [formula], for [formula], to [formula] from which it follows that the extension is L2 in any compact subset of [formula]. i.e., [formula].

Note that the closure of P not intersecting the coordinate axes was crucial in the above proof. This was highlighted earlier in Example [\ref=eg:HartogsTri] as well. Let us now proceed to prove the local version of the main theorem.

Let [formula] be a Reinhardt domain and P  ⊂  Ω be a product of annuli such that [formula] does not intersect the coordinate axes.

Then, for every f∈A2(Ω), BΩ extends holomorphically past [formula].

More precisely, there exists a product of annuli P' such that

[formula], and hence [formula],

[formula] does not intersect the coordinate axes, and

for every f∈A2(Ω), BΩ∈A2(P'). i.e., there exists F∈A2(P') such that [formula].

Write f∈A2(Ω) as [formula] with fα = 0 when zα∉A2(Ω). For [formula], let [formula] and [formula] noting that some of the cα's might be infinite. Hence,

[formula]

By Proposition [\ref=prop:ExtnProdAnn] there exists a larger product of annuli P' such that [formula] and BP∈A2(P'). If we let [formula] for [formula], we have,

[formula]

We conclude that BΩ∈A2(P') since [formula] and dα  ≤  cα for every [formula].

Let [formula] be a bounded Reinhardt domain such that [formula] does not intersect the coordinate axes.

Then, for every f∈A2(Ω), BΩ extends holomorphically to a (strictly) larger log-convex Reinhardt domain.

More precisely, there exists a log-convex Reinhardt domain [formula] such that

[formula], and

for every f∈A2(Ω), BΩ extends holomorphically to Ω'.

We apply the local version of the main theorem at each boundary point and show that this gives us the result. For every z∈bΩ, let Pz be a product of annuli satisfying the following properties: Pz  ⊂  Ω, z∈bPz, and [formula] does not intersect the coordinate axes. Note that this can be done since Ω is a Reinhardt domain whose closure does not intersect the coordinate axes. By Theorem [\ref=thm:MainLocalFull], there exists P'z, for every z∈bΩ, such that [formula], [formula] does not intersect the coordinate axes, and for every f∈A2(Ω), BΩ∈A2(P'z).

Since {P'z  :  z∈bΩ} covers bΩ, there exists [formula] such that {P'zj  :  1  ≤  j  ≤  N} covers bΩ. In fact, this sub-collection covers a full neighbourhood of bΩ. Now, let

[formula]

Clearly [formula] and Ω' is a Reinhardt domain. For f∈A2(Ω), BΩ∈A2(P'zj), for 1  ≤  j  ≤  N, as noted earlier and BΩ∈A2(Ω) by definition. Hence, BΩ∈A2(Ω') and, in particular, it is holomorphic in Ω'.

Recall that a Reinhardt domain is pseudoconvex if and only if it is log-convex. If Ω' is not pseudoconvex, all holomorphic functions on Ω' extend holomorphically to its pseudoconvex hull. Hence, we may replace Ω' by its pseudoconvex hull which is the smallest log-convex Reinhardt domain containing it.

Concluding Remarks

In light of the results presented here, it is natural to ask whether holomorphic extension (at least for conjugate holomorphic functions) holds on other classes of domains.

Recently, in [\cite=ChaDupMou] it is shown that the smoothing property observed in [\cite=HerMcN] [\cite=HerMcNStr] also holds for weighted Bergman projections. A direct adaptation of our arguments here would show that the same holomorphic extension also holds for weighted Bergman projections with multi-radial weights.

A version of the smoothing property shown in [\cite=HerMcN] also holds for the harmonic Bergman projection [\cite=Her13]. Analogously, one can investigate harmonic extension phenomena enjoyed by the harmonic Bergman projection on domains with certain symmetries.
