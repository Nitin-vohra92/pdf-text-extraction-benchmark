A remark on the multipliers on spaces of Weak Products of functions

Introduction

Let d be a positive integer and let [formula] denote the radial derivative operator. For [formula] the holomorphic Besov space Bs is defined to be the space of holomorphic functions f on the unit ball [formula] of [formula] such that for some nonnegative integer k > s

[formula]

Here dV denotes Lebesgue measure on [formula]. It is well-known that for any [formula] and any [formula] the quantity [formula] is finite for some nonnegative integer k > s if and only if it is finite for all nonnegative integers k > s, and that for each k > s [formula] defines a norm on Bs, and that all these norms are equivalent to one another, see [\cite=BeatrousBurbea]. For s < 0 one can take k = 0 and these spaces are weighted Bergman spaces. In particular, [formula] is the unweighted Bergman space. For s = 0 one obtains the Hardy space of [formula] and one has that for each k  ≥  1 [formula] is equivalent to [formula], where σ is the rotationally invariant probability measure on [formula]. We also note that for s = (d  -  1) / 2 we have Bs = H2d, the Drury-Arveson space. If d = 1 and s = 1 / 2, then Bs = D, the classical Dirichlet space of the unit disc.

Let [formula] be a reproducing kernel Hilbert space such that 1∈H. The weak product of H is denoted by [formula] and it is defined to be the collection of all functions [formula] such that there are sequences {fi}i  ≥  1,{gi}i  ≥  1  ⊆  H with [formula] and for all [formula], [formula].

We define a norm on [formula] by

[formula]

In what appears below we will frequently take H = Bs, and will use the same notation for this weak product.

Weak products have their origin in the work of Coifman, Rochberg, and Weiss [\cite=CRW]. In the frame work of the Hilbert space H one may consider the weak product to be an analogue of the Hardy H1-space. For example, one has [formula] and [formula], see [\cite=CRW]. For the Dirichlet space D the weak product [formula] has recently been considered in [\cite=ARSW], [\cite=CasOrt], [\cite=RiSu], [\cite=Luo], and [\cite=LuoRi]. The space [formula] was used in [\cite=RiSunkes]. For further motivation and general background on weak products we refer the reader to [\cite=ARSW] and [\cite=RiSu].

Let B be a Banach space of analytic functions on [formula] such that point evaluations are continuous and such that 1∈B. We use M(B) to denote the multiplier algebra of B,

[formula]

The multiplier norm [formula] is defined to be the norm of the associated multiplication operator Mφ:B  →  B. It is easy to check and is well-known that [formula], and that for s  ≤  0 we have [formula]. For s > d / 2 the space Bs is an algebra [\cite=BeatrousBurbea], hence Bs  =  M(Bs), but for 0 < s  ≤  d / 2 one has [formula] For those cases M(Bs) has been described by a certain Carleson measure condition, see [\cite=OrtFab] [\cite=CasFabOrt].

It is easy to see that [formula] (see Proposition [\ref=MultIncl]). Thus, if s  ≤  0, then [formula]. Furthermore, if s > d / 2, then [formula] since Bs is an algebra. This raises the question whether M(Bs) and [formula] always agree. We prove the following:

Let [formula] and [formula]. If s  ≤  1 or d  ≤  2, then [formula].

Note that when d  ≤  2, then Bs is an algebra for all s > 1. Thus for each [formula] the nontrivial range of the Theorem is 0 < s  ≤  1. If d = 1 then the theorem applies to the classical Dirichlet space of the unit disc and for d  ≤  3 it applies to the Drury-Arveson space.

Preliminaries

For [formula] and [formula] we write eitz = (eitz1,...,eitzd) and we write 〈z,w〉 for the inner product in [formula]. Furthermore, if h is a function on [formula], then we define Ttf by (Ttf)(z) = f(eitz). We say that a space [formula] is radially symmetric, if each Tt acts isometrically on H and if for all [formula], Tt  →  Tt0 in the strong operator topology as t  →  t0, i.e. if [formula] and [formula] for all f∈H. For example, for each [formula] the holomorphic Besov space Bs is radially symmetric when equipped with any of the norms [formula], k > s.

It is elementary to verify the following lemma.

If [formula] is radially symmetric, then so is [formula].

Note that if h and φ are functions on [formula], then for every [formula] we have (Ttφ)h = Tt(φT- th), hence if a space is radially symmetric, then Tt acts isometrically on the multiplier algebra. For 0 < r < 1 we write fr(z) = f(rz).

If [formula] is radially symmetric, and if [formula], then for all 0 < r < 1 we have [formula].

Let [formula] and [formula], then for 0 < r < 1 we have

[formula]

This implies

[formula]

Thus, [formula].

Multipliers

The following Proposition is elementary.

We have [formula] and if φ∈M(H), [formula].

As explained in the Introduction, the following will establish Theorem [\ref=MainTh].

Let 0 < s  ≤  1. Then [formula] and there is a Cs > 0 such that

[formula]

for all φ∈M(Bs).

Here for each s we have the norm on Bs to be [formula], where k is the smallest natural number > s.

We first do the case 0 < s < 1. Then k = 1, and [formula], where dVs(z) = (1 - |z|2)1 - 2sdV(z). For later reference we note that a short calculation shows that [formula].

We write [formula] for the Carleson measure norm of |Rφ|2, i.e.

[formula]

Since [formula] it is clear that [formula] is equivalent to [formula]. Thus, it suffices to show that there is a c > 0 such that [formula] for all [formula].

First we note that if b is holomorphic in a neighborhood of [formula] and [formula], then

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

where we have continued to write [formula] for [formula].

Let [formula] and let 0 < r < 1. Then for all f∈Bs we have [formula], hence

[formula]

Next we take the sup of the left hand side of this expression over all f with [formula] and we obtain [formula] which implies that [formula] holds for all 0 < r < 1. Thus, for 0 < s < 1 the result follows from Fatou's lemma as r  →  1.

If s = 1, then [formula] and the argument proceeds as above.
