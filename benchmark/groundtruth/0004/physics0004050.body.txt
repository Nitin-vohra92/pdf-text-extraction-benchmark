A BRIEF NOTE ON THE MAGNETIC EFFECTS OF THE ELECTRON

E-mail:birlasc@hd1.vsnl.net.in

In a recent model[\cite=r1] [\cite=r2] [\cite=r3] it was shown how an electron could be described as a Kerr-Newman type black hole with Quantum Mechanical inputs. Such a scheme lead to a cosmology consistent with all so called large number relations and which predicted that the universe would continue to expand for ever[\cite=r4] [\cite=r5], as indeed has been subsequently observed[\cite=r6] [\cite=r7]. Moreover this scheme also gives a description of the quark picture including such features as the characteristic fractional charge, handedness, confinement and an order of magnitude estimate of the masses[\cite=r8] [\cite=r9] [\cite=r10]. We would now like to point out two additional consequences of the above model, one an extra magnetic effect in the electromagnetic vacuum and the other an Aharanov-Bohm type effect[\cite=r11]. We first observe that the magnetic component of the field of a static electron as a Kerr-Newman black hole is given in the familiar spherical polar coordinates by (Cf.refs.[\cite=r1] [\cite=r2])

[formula]

whereas the electrical part is given by

[formula]

A comparison of ([\ref=e1]) and ([\ref=e2]) shows that there is a magnetic component of shorter range apart from the dipole which is given by the first term on the right in equation ([\ref=e1])- infact this model also exhibits the anomalous gyro magnetic ratio g = 2 of the electron. We would like to point out that a short range force the B(3) force mediated by massive photons has indeed been observed at Cornell and studied over the past few years[\cite=r12]. On the other hand as the Kerr-Newman charged black hole can be approximated by a solinoid, we have as in the Aharonov-Bohm effect, a negligible magnetic field outdside, but at the same time a real vector potential [formula] which would contribute to a shift in phase. Infact this shift in phase is given by

[formula]

There is also a similar effect due to the electric charge given by

[formula]

where A0 is the usual electro static potential given in ([\ref=e2]). In the above Kerr-Newman formulation, [formula] of ([\ref=e3]) and ([\ref=e4]) are given by (Cf.refs.[\cite=r1] [\cite=r2])

[formula]

From ([\ref=e5]) it can be seen that

[formula]

Substitution of ([\ref=e6]) in ([\ref=e3]) then gives us the contribution of the shift in phase due to the magnetic field.
