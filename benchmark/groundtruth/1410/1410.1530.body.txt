Simulations on the survivability of Tidal Dwarf Galaxies

Introduction

The formation of TDGs, as actively star-forming gaseous over-densities embedded in the tidal arms of interacting galaxies, is studied with observations in various wavelengths and their formation is modelled within large-scale simulations of galaxy interactions [\citep=Duc2013]. Whereas they are easily identifiable when they are still connected to the tidal arm, their typical lifetimes remain under discussion. The contribution of ancient TDGs to the population of low-mass galaxies depends on both their formation rate as well as on their survivability. The estimates of dwarf galaxies (DGs) with a tidal origin cover a wide range from 6% [\citep=Kaviraj2012] to 100% [\citep=Okazaki2000]. Long-term chemo-dynamical simulations of TDGs do not only allow for a better estimate of their typical lifetimes but can also constrain the physical and chemical properties of ancient TDGs.

Results

Early response to stellar feedback: The initial conditions of the simulated TDGs represent a spherical, pressure supported gas cloud with cold over-densities that serve as the seeds for immediate star formation (SF). Within 20 Myr after the simulations start, the total SF rate of the TDGs reaches [formula]. We study the response of dark matter (DM)-free DGs to different stellar feedback scenarios. In the low feedback case, the initial mass function (IMF) of each star cluster is truncated at a maximal star mass up to which at least a single star can be formed and that is dependent on the mass of the star cluster [\citep=Kroupa2003] [\citep=Weidner2013]. For the high feedback case the IMF is assumed to be completely filled up to a maximal star mass of [formula] for every star cluster. In the first 300 Myr, the stellar feedback regulates the SF significantly stronger in the high feedback case, resulting in a 6 times lower stellar mass after 500 Myr than in the low feedback case ([formula] and [formula], respectively). After 300 Myr, both simulated TDGs regulate their SF to a constant rate below [formula]. In both cases, the initially high SF does not lead to a disruption of the TDG [\citep=Ploeckinger2014a].

Long term evolution: Starting from a smooth, warm, rotating gas cloud in the tidal field of a massive galaxy, we simulate the long-term evolution of TDGs. In order to carve out the effect of the tidal field, a comparison simulation of an identical but isolated TDG is performed. In the first Gyr the SF is comparable. After 1 Gyr, as the TDG in the tidal field is approaching the peri-center of its orbit, the TDG is compressed and subsequently the SF increases by more than 2 orders of magnitude, but both TDGs survive until the end of the simulation time at t = 3 Gyr [\citep=Ploeckinger2014b].

Conclusions

We simulate pressure supported and rotating TDGs, with low and high stellar feedback, and exposed them to ram pressure and a tidal field. All simulated TDGs ([formula]) survive until the end of the simulation (up to 3 Gyr). This serves as an additional sign that TDGs can turn into long-lived objects, complementary to indications from observations [\citep=Dabringhausen2013] [\citep=Duc2014] and simulations of galaxy interactions [\citep=Bournaud2006] [\citep=Hammer2010] [\citep=Fouquet2012].
