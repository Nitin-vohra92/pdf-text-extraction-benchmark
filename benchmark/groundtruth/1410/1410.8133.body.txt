Genus two trisections are standard

Introduction

A trisection of a smooth 4-manifold X is a decomposition of X into three pieces, each of which is diffeomorphic to a 4-dimensional handlebody. Trisections have been introduced by Gay and Kirby as a 4-dimensional analogue to Heegaard splittings of 3-manifolds [\cite=gay-kirby:trisections]. An explicit goal of the theory of trisections is to provide a vehicle to apply 3-manifold techniques to problems in 4-dimensional topology. In their seminal paper, they prove that every closed, orientable 4-manifold admits a trisection, and any two trisections for the same 4-manifold become isotopic after some number of iterations of a natural stabilization operation, akin to the Reidemeister-Singer Theorem in dimension three.

While a Heegaard splitting of a 3-manifold has only one complexity parameter (the genus of the splitting), a trisection comes equipped with two such parameters. A (g,k)-trisection of a closed, orientable, smooth 4-manifold X is a decomposition

[formula]

where each Xi is a 4-dimensional 1-handlebody obtained by attaching k 1-handles to one 0-handle, each [formula] is 3-dimensional genus g handlebody, and [formula] is a closed genus g surface, which we call a trisection surface. Observe that Σ is a Heegaard surface for each 3-manifold ∂Xi  =    #  k(S1  ×  S2); hence, the definition implies that g  ≥  k.

Since the field is still in its infancy, there are many basic questions about trisections which have not yet been answered. In terms of 3-manifolds, the only manifold Y with a genus zero Heegaard splitting is S3, and the manifolds with genus one splittings (lens spaces, S1  ×  S2, and S3) are neatly parameterized by the extended rational numbers. This leads to the following general question.

To what extent can we enumerate (g,k)-trisections for small values of g?

In addition to proving the existence of trisections, Gay and Kirby relate them to handle decompositions. They show that a 4-manifold admitting a (g,k)-trisection has a handle decomposition with one 0-handle, k 1-handles, (g - k) 2-handles, k 3-handles, and one 4-handle. As such, it is easy to classify (g,g)-trisections. If X has a (g,g)-trisection, then X has a handle decomposition with no 2-handles; therefore, by [\cite=laudenbach-poenaru], we have that X is diffeomorphic to #  g(S1  ×  S3) (where #  0(S1  ×  S3)  =  S4). It follows that there is a unique genus zero trisection: the standard (0,0)-trisection of S4 into three 4-balls, two of which are glued to each other along one hemisphere of their 3-sphere boundaries, and the third of which is attached along the resulting 3-sphere boundary.

Note that every Heegaard splitting [formula] can be presented by a Heegaard diagram (in fact, infinitely many Heegaard diagrams), which is a triple denoted (Σ,α,β). This notion has an analogue in terms of trisections: a (g,k)-trisection diagram is a quadruple (Σ,α,β,γ) such that each Heegaard diagram (Σ,α,β), (Σ,β,γ), and (Σ,α,γ) presents a genus g splitting of #  k(S1  ×  S2). Every trisection diagram yields a straightforward construction of a trisected 4-manifold X (see Section [\ref=sec:prelims]).

The manifolds that admit genus one trisections are not difficult to classify; they are described in detail in [\cite=gay-kirby:trisections] and diagrams of these trisections are pictured in Figure [\ref=fig:G1Diags]. There are precisely two manifolds which admit (1,0)-trisections: [formula] and [formula]. Thus, the situation is somewhat different here than in dimension three, suggesting another basic question.

What is the smallest value of g for which there are infinitely many 4-manifolds X which admit a (g,k)-trisection for some k?

Work in progress by the authors and David Gay reveals that the answer to Question [\ref=infinite] satisfies g  ≤  3. It is shown that if X is the double cover of S4 branched over a k-twist spun 2-bridge knot where k  ≠    ±  1, then X admits a minimal genus (3,1)-trisection [\cite=gmz]. Hence, Question [\ref=infinite] reduces to understanding genus two trisections. This brings us to the main result of the present paper.

If X admits a genus two trisection, then X is either S2  ×  S2 or a connected sum of S1  ×  S3, [formula], and [formula] with two summands. Moreover, each of these 4-manifolds has a unique genus two trisection up to diffeomorphism.

Suppose X admits a (2,k)-trisection [formula]. If k  =  2, then trivially X is diffeomorphic to (S1  ×  S3)  #  (S1  ×  S3) and has a trisection diagram (α,β,γ) such that α  =  β  =  γ. If k  =  1, then by Corollary [\ref=21class], the trisection is reducible and can be written as the connected sum of one of the standard (1,0)-trisections and the standard (1,1)-trisection shown in Figure [\ref=fig:G1Diags]. It follows that X is diffeomorphic to [formula] or [formula]. Finally, if k  =  2, then by Theorem [\ref=claim2], the trisection has a diagram homeomorphic to one of the standard diagrams pictured in Figure [\ref=fig:StdDiags], and thus X is diffeomorphic to S2  ×  S2, [formula], or [formula] by [\cite=gay-kirby:trisections].

The bulk of this paper is devoted to proving Theorem [\ref=claim2], the classification of (2,0)-trisections, by understanding (2,0)-trisection diagrams (Σ,α,β,γ). In this case, each of (Σ,α,β), (Σ,β,γ), and (Σ,γ,α) is a genus two Heegaard diagram for S3, and these are well-studied objects in 3-manifold topology. A result of Homma-Ochiai-Takahashi [\cite=hot] states that every genus two Heegaard splitting of S3 can be reduced algorithmically (see Section [\ref=sec:prelims]), and this is the main input into our proof of Theorem [\ref=claim2].

As a corollary to the main theorem, we obtain the following result (see Section [\ref=sec:surgery] for definitions).

Suppose that L is a two-component link contained in a genus two Heegaard surface Σ for S3, and L admits an S3 surgery with slope given by the surface slope of L in Σ. Then there is a series of handle slides on L contained in the surface Σ that converts L to a (  ±  1)-framed unlink or a 0-framed Hopf link.

In Section [\ref=sec:surgery], we discuss how Corollary [\ref=cor:surgery] relates to the search for exotic, simply connected 4-manifolds with b2 = 2. We also remark on the similarity between Corollary [\ref=cor:surgery] and the Generalized Property R Conjecture [\cite=gst].

Organization

In Section [\ref=sec:prelims], we introduce notation and terminology which will be used in the rest of the paper. In Section [\ref=sec:start], we define a complexity measure for (2,0)-trisection diagrams and prove some preliminary results about this complexity. Section [\ref=sec:digress] includes a digression into a special type of Heegaard diagram for S3, which we will use to further reduce the complexity of an arbitrary trisection diagram in Section [\ref=sec:hard_case]. We prove the main theorem about (2,0)-trisections in Section [\ref=sec:main] and conclude by classifying (2,1)-trisections and establishing Corollary [\ref=cor:surgery] in Section [\ref=sec:surgery].

Preliminary Set-up

Manifolds are orientable and connected unless otherwise specified. For the remainder of the paper, we fix a genus two surface Σ and let ν(  ·  ) denote an open regular neighborhood in Σ. We use the term curve to mean an isotopy class of simple closed curves in Σ. Given two distinct curves c1 and c2 in Σ, we assume that c1 and c2 have been isotoped so that [formula] is minimal, and we let ι(c1,c2) denote this geometric intersection number. By orienting c1 and c2, we can also compute the algebraic intersection number, denoted c1  ·  c2, by counting the signed intersection number of c1 and c2.

A cut system α for Σ is a pair of disjoint curves α1 and α2 that cut Σ into a four-punctured sphere, which we will denote Σα. In a slight abuse of language, we refer to [formula] as both a four-punctured sphere and a sphere with four boundary components. A Heegaard diagram (Σ,α,β) consists of two cut systems α and β for Σ, whereas a trisection diagram (Σ,α,β,γ) consists of three cut systems α, β, and γ for Σ with the additional restrictions described above. We often suppress Σ and simply write (α,β) and (α,β,γ) for Heegaard and trisection diagrams, respectively. Given a Heegaard diagram (α,β), we may construct a 3-manifold by gluing 3-dimensional 2-handles along α and β on opposite sides of a product neighborhood Σ  ×  I of Σ and capping off the resulting 2-sphere boundary components with 3-balls. Similarly, given a trisection diagram (Σ,α,β,γ), we may construct a 4-manifold by taking a 4-dimensional regular neighborhood Σ  ×  D of Σ and attaching 4-dimensional 2-handles along α  ×  {1}, β  ×  {e2πi / 3}, and γ  ×  {e4πi / 3}, where D is viewed as the complex unit disk and the framings of the handle attachments are given by Σ  ×  {p}. Finally, we cap off boundary components with 3- and 4-handles, which can be done in a unique way by [\cite=laudenbach-poenaru].

We begin by stating several standard lemmata dealing with genus two Heegaard diagrams of S3. We say that a Heegaard diagram (α,β) for S3, where α  =  {α1,α2} and β  =  {β1,β2}, is trivial if ι(αi,βj)  =  δij. Trivial Heegaard diagrams are unique (up to homeomorphism). Given a Heegaard diagram (α,β), we define the intersection matrix M(α,β) of (α,β) to be

[formula]

If (α,β) is a Heegaard diagram for S3, then [formula].

It follows immediately that if (α,β) is a Heegaard diagram for S3 satisfying ι(α,β)  =  2, then (α,β) is the trivial diagram. Now, suppose that α1,α2, and α3 are pairwise disjoint curves in Σ, and let α  =  {α1,α2} and α'  =  {α2,α3}. We say that α and α' are related by a handle slide.

[\cite=johannson] Two Heegaard diagrams (α,β) and (α',β') determine the same Heegaard splitting if and only if there are sequences of handle slides taking α to α' and β to β'.

We now turn our attention to trisection diagrams. The first lemma is due to Gay and Kirby.

[\cite=gay-kirby:trisections] Two trisection diagrams (α,β,γ) and (α',β',γ') determine the same trisection if and only if there are sequences of handle slides taking α to α, β to β', and γ to γ'.

We say that a (2,0)-trisecton diagram (α,β,γ) is standard if ι(α,β)  =  ι(α,γ)  =  ι(β,γ)  =  2. In Figure [\ref=fig:StdDiags], [formula] is shown for each of the three standard (2,0)-trisection diagrams. The main theorem presented in this paper asserts that for any (2,0)-trisection diagram (α,β,γ), there is a sequence of handle slides taking (α,β,γ) to one of these three standard diagrams.

For α  =  {α1,α2} and C a collection of curves in Σ, intersection [formula] is a collection of properly embedded essential arcs. Viewing the boundary components of [formula] as four fat vertices and the essential arcs as edges, we may consider [formula] as a (topological) graph, the Whitehead graph of C with respect to α, denoted Σα(C). By collapsing each boundary component of Σα to a vertex and collections of parallel edges in Σα(C) to a single edge, we construct the reduced Whitehead graph Gα(C). To avoid confusion, we will refer to edges in Σα(C) as arcs and edges in Gα(C) as edges. If an arc a in [formula] corresponds to an edge e in Gα(C), we say that a is in the edge e. The weight of an edge e∈Gα(C), denoted wC(e), is the number of arcs in e. If C'  ⊂  C, then Σα(C') is a subgraph of [formula] and Gα(C') is a subgraph of Gα(C). In this case we let wC'(e) denote the weight of e as an edge in Gα(C'). We use α±i (i = 1,2) to denote the vertices of both [formula] and Gα(C).

Non-isotopic arcs a and b in [formula] can intersect in two fundamentally different ways. If an intersection point [formula] is a vertex of a triangle in [formula] cobounded by subarcs of a, b, and a boundary component α±i, we call p an inessential point of intersection based in α±i. Note that if a and b are arcs of [formula] and [formula] for curves c,d  ⊂  Σ, then there is an isotopy of c and d in Σ which pushes p through α±i, converting it to an inessential point of intersection based in α∓i. A point [formula] which is not inessential is called an essential point of intersection. See Figure [\ref=fig:InessentialInt]. Observe that essential points of intersection are present in [formula] but we lose all information about inessential points of intersection when passing from [formula] to [formula].

An arc a in [formula] with endpoints in disjoint boundary components is called a seam. Otherwise a is called a wave. Seams in Σα may be parameterized by the extended rational numbers [formula] in the following way: Choose four pairwise disjoint seams which cut Σ into two squares with their vertices removed. Assign the left and right sides of the square the slope [formula] and the top and bottom the slope [formula]. Any other seam may be isotoped to have constant rational slope in each of the squares, and we assign this slope to the seam.

We call a seam in Σα that connects either α+1 or α-1 to either α+2 or α-2 a cross-seam, since it travels across Σα from one pair of boundary components to the other. Cross-seams come in pairs: There is a hyperelliptic involution J of Σ that leaves every curve invariant [\cite=haas-susskind]. Thus, the restriction of J to Σα is a homeomorphism of [formula] which maps α±i to α∓i. It follows that if c is a curve in Σ and a+ is a cross-seam of [formula] connecting to α+1 to α±2, then since J(c)  =  c, we have that a-  =  J(a+) is a cross-seam of [formula] connecting α-1 to α∓2. See Figure [\ref=fig:Involutions].

Next, we show that the slopes of seams determine the number of times they intersect essentially. For each essential arc a  ⊂  Σα, there is a unique essential curve in [formula], which we will henceforth call Δa, such that [formula]. See Figure [\ref=fig:WaveSurgIntPf].

If a and b are seams in Σα parameterized by slopes [formula] and [formula], respectively, and a and b have endpoints on k common boundary components of ∂Σα, (where k∈{0,1,2}), then a and b intersect essentially in [formula] points.

It is well-known that i(Δa,Δb)  =  2|wz - xy|. Each common boundary component of a and b contributes two points of intersection to [formula], and each essential point of intersection of a and b contributes four points of intersection to [formula]. See Figure [\ref=fig:WaveSurgIntPf]. If there are q essential points of [formula], it follows that

[formula]

which easily yields the desired statement.

Given a Heegaard diagram (α,β), an α-wave for (α,β) is wave ω properly embedded in [formula] such that [formula]. A β-wave is defined similarly. If such an arc exists, we say that (α,β) contains a wave based in α (resp., β) and that [formula] (resp., [formula]) contains a wave. Let α  =  {α1,α2} and α3  =  Δω, and suppose that ∂ω  ⊂  α±1. Then α'  =  {α2,α3} is related to α by a handle slide, and we say that the diagram (α',β) is the result of wave surgery (or just surgery, for short) on α along ω.

[\cite=hot] Let (α,β) be a Heegaard diagram for S3 that contains a wave based in α, and let (α',β) be the diagram obtained by wave surgery on α. Then ι(α',β) < ι(α,β).

Thus, it is desirable for a nontrivial Heegaard diagram to contain a wave, as it allows for a straightforward simplification of the diagram. Unfortunately, this is not the case for Heegaard diagrams of S3 of arbitrary genera [\cite=ochiai:Whitehead]. However, the situation in genus two is much more manageable, as is shown by the following theorem of Homma, Ochiai, and Takahashi.

[\cite=hot] Every nontrivial genus two Heegaard diagram for S3 contains a wave.

Wave surgery has a dual notion, known as banding. Let α'  =  {α2,α3} and suppose υ is an arc with one endpoint on each of α2 and α3 and whose interior is disjoint from α' (we call υ a band). Then one component α1 of [formula] is not isotopic to α2 or α3, and we that say α1 is the result of banding α2 to α3. For every wave ω such that wave surgery on α  =  {α1,α2} yields α'  =  {α2,α3}, there is a dual band υ such that α1 is the result of banding α2 to α3; thus, banding and wave surgery are inverse processes.

We now state several general facts about the reduced Whitehead graphs corresponding to genus two Heegaard diagrams. First, every such graph is isomorphic to one of the graphs shown in Figure [\ref=fig:WhGraphs] [\cite=ochiai:Whitehead], which we henceforth refer to as Type I, Type II, and Type III, as labeled in the figure. We will automatically assume that a graph of one of these types inherits the edge labelings shown. Note that if all edge weights are nonzero, then the three families are mutually exclusive; however, if some edge weights are zero there may be graphs that fall into more than one family. In addition, the existence of the involution J implies that wβ(a+)  =  wβ(a-) and wβ(b+)  =  wβ(b-) and so we may denote these weights wβ(a) and wβ(b) without ambiguity.

If a reduced Whitehead graph Gα(β) contains exactly four edges and one 4-cycle, we will call Gα(β) a square graph. Equivalently, a square graph is a Type I graph such that wβ(b)  =  0 and all other edges have nonzero weights. If Gα(β) is a graph of any type such that wβ(a),wβ(c)  ≠  0 while wβ(b) = wβ(d)  =  0, we say that Gα(β) is a c-graph (as its shape looks like the letter c).

The next lemma provides basic information about some of the weights in Gα(β) when (α,β) is a diagram for S3.

If (α,β) is a nontrivial diagram for S3, then Σα(β) contains a cross-seam.

Observe that if (α,β) contains a wave based in α, then the graph Gα(β) must be of Type III. A graph of Type I or II that admits a wave must also fall under the Type III category. Figure [\ref=fig:TypeIIIWave] shows the obvious wave in this case. Equivalently, (α,β) contains a wave based in α if and only if a vertex in Gα(β) has valence one (recall that Gα(β) is a reduced graph). Note that Theorem [\ref=wave] implies that if (α,β) is a Heegaard diagram for S3, then there is a wave based in either α or β. However, if Gα(β) is a c-graph, we can say something stronger:

If (α,β) is a diagram for S3 and Gα(β) is a c-graph, then (α,β) contains a wave based in α and a wave based in β.

In this case, [formula] contains some number of rectangular regions and one 12-sided region, which we will call U, where the boundary of U alternates between a set of six arcs in α and a set of six arcs in β. See Figure [\ref=fig:cGraphWave]. A choice of orientation α and β orients each arc in ∂U clockwise or counter-clockwise. Moreover, each α-arc comes from either α1 or α2. Therefore, there are four labeling options for each α-arc. However, since there are six α-arcs, at least two have a common labeling, and an arc [formula] in U connecting two such arcs is a wave based in α. See Figure [\ref=fig:cGraphWave](b). A parallel argument shows that there is a wave [formula] in U based in β.

In the case-by-case arguments that follow, we attempt to rule out the existence of certain waves for a Heegaard diagram, so we lay the groundwork for that strategy here. If two oriented curves meet in two points, we say that these points are coherently oriented if they have the same sign and oppositely oriented if they have opposite sign. Note that this definition is independent of the choice of orientations on the curves. If (α,β) is a Heegaard diagram and there is a choice of orientations on curves in α and β so that all points of [formula] are coherently oriented, we call (α,β) a positive Heegaard diagram.

Suppose that (α,β) is a Heegaard diagram and that β1 contains an arc a that meets α1 only in its oppositely oriented endpoints and meets α2 in one point in its interior. We call an arc a satisfying these conditions a wave-busting arc. Similarly, if β contains two arcs c and d such that c meets α1 only in its coherently oriented endpoints and avoids α2, while d meets α2 only in its coherently oriented endpoints and avoids α1, we say that the pair (c,d) is a wave-busting pair. The next lemma makes clear our use of the term "wave-busting."

If (α,β) is a nontrivial Heegaard diagram such that β contains a wave-busting arc a or a wave-busting pair (c,d), then (α,β) does not contain a wave based in α.

A wave-busting arc a contributes two cross-seams to Gα(β), one from α±1 to α+2 and one from α±1 to α-2. It follows by the symmetry of Gα(β) that each vertex has valence at least two, and thus Gα(β) cannot be a graph of Type III. On the other hand, a wave-busting pair contributes seams connecting α+1 to α-1 and α+2 to α-2, again implying that Gα(β) is not a Type III graph.

To conclude this section, we discuss how homeomorphisms of Σα can be used to reduce the number of cases in the arguments that follow. The five homeomorphisms most relevant to our proof are shown in Figure [\ref=fig:Involutions]. The mapping class group of a four-punctured sphere is generated by [formula] and two involutions [\cite=farb-margalit:primer], the first of which is the hyperelliptic involution J discussed above, and the second of which we will call J' and is depicted in Figure [\ref=fig:Involutions](a). Note that J and J' preserve the slopes of arcs in [formula], so to determine the behavior of slopes of arcs with respect to a given homeomorphism σ, we need only specify an element of [formula], which we will call Mσ.

Let cφ  =  Δa for a seam a of slope [formula], and let the homeomorphism φ be given by fixing α±1 and cφ and performing a half-twist on α±2 which exchanges these two punctures, as in Figure [\ref=fig:Involutions](b). The matrices for φ and φ- 1 are given by

[formula]

The remaining two homeomorphisms reverse the orientation of [formula]. Let H be the horizontal reflection fixing the curve cH shown in Figure [\ref=fig:Involutions](a), and let ψ be a reflection of [formula] fixing the four arcs denoted cψ in Figure [\ref=fig:Involutions](c). Note that ψ preserves a Type III graph; edges a± and b± are fixed, while edges c and d are exchanged. The matrices for H and ψ are given by

[formula]

The complexity of a (2,0)-trisection diagram

To classify (2,0)-trisections, we will show that a trisection diagram which minimizes a prescribed complexity over all diagrams corresponding to a fixed (2,0)-trisection must be a standard diagram. Define the complexity C(α,β,γ) of a trisection diagram (α,β,γ) to be the triple given by

[formula]

For a (2,0)-trisection [formula], we call a trisection diagram minimal if it minimizes the complexity C (with the dictionary ordering) among diagrams satisfying ι(α,β) = 2. A plurality of this paper (Sections [\ref=sec:start]-[\ref=sec:hard_case]) is devoted to proving the following proposition, which we will use later to classify (2,0)-trisections in Section [\ref=sec:main].

If (α,β,γ) is minimal, then ι(α,γ)  =  2.

To prove the proposition, we will suppose by way of contradiction that (α,β,γ) is minimal, but (α,γ) is not trivial, so that ι(α,γ)  >  2. We may also suppose that (β,γ) is not trivial; otherwise C(β,γ,α)  <  C(α,β,γ) and (α,β,γ) is not minimal. One case is quite easy to rule out.

If Gγ(α) is a Type III graph, then (α,β,γ) is not minimal.

In this case, Σγ(α) contains a wave, and we let γ' be the result of surgery on γ along this wave, so that γ and γ' are related by a handle slide. With Figure [\ref=fig:TypeIIIWave] in mind, we compute

[formula]

Thus, if wα2(a) or wα2(b) is nonzero in Gγ(α), then ι(α2,γ')  <  ι(α2,γ) and C(α,β,γ')  <  C(α,β,γ). Otherwise, we have ι(α2,γ)  =  ι(α2,γ'). However, since γ' is surgery on γ along a wave, ι(α,γ')  <  ι(α,γ), which implies that ι(α1,γ')  <  ι(α1,γ), and once again, C(α,β,γ')  <  C(α,β,γ). In either case, (α,β,γ) is not minimal.

Using Equations ([\ref=eq1]) and ([\ref=eq2]), we also have the next lemma.

If Gγ(α2) is a Type III graph that contains a cross-seam, then (α,β,γ) is not minimal.

In this case, we have wα2(a)  ≠  0, and so (α,β,γ) is not minimal by the proof of Lemma [\ref=gwave].

By Theorem [\ref=wave] and the assumption that (α,γ) is not trivial, we have that (α,γ) contains a wave ω. If ω is based in γ, then Gγ(α) is a Type III graph, so (α,β,γ) is not minimal by Lemma [\ref=gwave]. Thus, we may assume that ω is based in α, and Gα(γ) is a Type III graph. Since (α,β,γ) is minimal, we have that ι(α2,γ)  ≤  ι(α1,γ); otherwise we could change the labeling of α  =  {α1,α2} to reduce complexity. Therefore, we can assume that ∂ω  ⊂  α1.

We parameterize arcs in Gα(γ) by assigning the seams connecting α+1 to α-1 the slopes [formula] and [formula], and the seams connecting α±1 to α±2 the slope [formula]. Since ι(α,β)  =  2, each intersection [formula] is a single seam connecting α+i and α-i for i = 1,2, and these two seams have the same slope. Let [formula] denote the slope of these seams, noting that m must be odd and n must be even, and we suppose that m  >  0. We also assume that ι(αi,βj)  =  δij. In the case that m  =  1, there is a curve β3 such that [formula] consists of two cross-seams of slope [formula] and [formula]. See Figure [\ref=fig:Case-m=1]. We call the curve β3 the 0-replacement for β.

If m  =  1, then (α,β,γ) is not minimal.

Let α'  =  {α3,α2} be the result of surgery on α along the wave ω, let β3 be the 0-replacement for β, and let β'  =  {β1,β3}. Then α and β are related to α' and β' by handle slides, and ι(α',β')  =  2. However, ι(α3,γ)  <  ι(α1,γ) and thus C(α',β',γ)  <  C(α,β,γ). See Figure [\ref=fig:Case-m=1].

We suppose for the remainder of this section that m  ≥  3. Our plan of attack is as follows: We show that, in most cases, (β,γ) contains a wave based in γ and that (α,β,γ) is not minimal by Lemma [\ref=nogwave]. In the exceptional case, we will prove in Section [\ref=sec:hard_case] that (β,γ) is not a Heegaard diagram for S3, a contradiction.

Before we proceed, we require a technical lemma, which we state in greatest generality for use in later sections.

Suppose that (δ,ε) is a Heegaard diagram such that ι(δ1,ε2)  =  0 and Gδ(ε) is a square graph. Then (δ,ε) is not a Heegaard diagram for S3.

We label the edges of the Type I graph Gδ(ε) as in Figure [\ref=fig:WhGraphs], noting that ε2 contributes to only one edge, d, in Gδ(ε). Let k1  =  wε2(d). Since Gδ(ε) is a square graph, we may orient δ and ε so that all intersection points have the same sign; thus, (δ,ε) is a positive Heegaard diagram. It follows that ι(δi,εj)  =  δi  ·  εj. Since all edges of Gδ(ε) have nonzero weights, ε1 intersects δ2 in k2  =  wε(a) > 0 points and δ1 in k3  =  wε(a)  +  wε(c)  >  1 points. This implies that the intersection matrix M(δ,ε) is

[formula]

where [formula]. Thus, (δ,ε) is not a Heegaard diagram for S3 by Lemma [\ref=determ].

Now, we return to (α,β,γ). If β* is a seam in Σα(β) connecting α+i to α-i, then the slope of β* is [formula]. A seam γ* in [formula] connecting α+1 to α1  -   has slope [formula] or [formula], while a cross-seam has slope [formula]. It follows from Lemma [\ref=inter] that β* intersects γ* essentially. The same is true if γ* is a wave arc. Recall that we have assumed that (β,γ) is not trivial, so by Theorem [\ref=wave], (β,γ) contains a wave.

If (β,γ) contains a wave based in γ, then (α,β,γ) is not minimal.

If (β,γ) contains a wave based in γ, then Gγ(β) is a Type III graph, and thus each vertex γ±2 is incident to only one edge a± in Gγ(β). Isotope α so that any inessential intersections of α and β in [formula] based in γ±2 (there are at most two of them) are based in γ-2. We note that γ+2 does not contain two consecutive intersections with α. Otherwise, the subarc connecting such intersections corresponds to an arc γ* in [formula] which avoids β, contradicting that every such arc γ* intersects an arc of β essentially in [formula].

It follows that in Σγ(α,β), all α-arcs meeting γ+2 with possibly one exception are situated between β-arcs in the edge a+. In other words, in the reduced graph Gγ(α), the vertex γ+2 is incident to at most two edges, one of which has the same slope as a+ in Gγ(β), and so we will call this edge a+, and the other of which we will call e. See Figure [\ref=fig:LocalC2+]. Note that wα(e)  =  1. We split the remainder of the argument into four cases, based on possible values of wα2(a) and wα2(e).

Case 1: wα2(a)  ≠  0 and wα2(e)  =  0. In this case, the vertex γ+2 has valence one in Gγ(α2) and Gγ(α2) contains the cross-seam a+. By Lemma [\ref=g2wave], the diagram (α,β,γ) is not minimal.

Case 2: wα2(a)  =  0 and wα2(e)  ≠  0. If e is a cross-seam, then by the same argument as in Case 1, (α,β,γ) is not minimal. Otherwise, e connects γ+2 to γ-2. By the argument above, γ±2 is incident to exactly two edges a± and e in Gγ(α). If γ±1 has valence one in Gγ(α), then Gγ(α) is a c-graph and there is a wave for (α,γ) based in γ by Lemma [\ref=12gon] and thus (α,β,γ) is not minimal by Lemma [\ref=gwave]. If γ+1 has valence greater than one, there is another edge c incident to γ+1 in Gγ(α), and c must connect γ+1 to γ-1. It follows that Gγ(α) is a Type I graph with only one cross-seam; equivalently, Gγ(α) is a square graph, and the assumption wα2(a)  =  0 implies that ι(α2,γ1)  =  0. However, in this case Lemma [\ref=missedcase] implies that (α,γ) is not a Heegaard diagram for S3, a contradiction.

Case 3: wα2(a)  ≠  0 and wα2(e)  ≠  0. Here, wα2(e)  =  1 and thus wα1(e)  =  0. Let γ3  =  Δa and γ'  =  {γ2,γ3}, so that γ is related to γ' by a handle slide. There are two subcases to consider; refer to Figure [\ref=fig:a2graphs]. Suppose first that e is a cross-seam, so that there is another cross-seam e' which meets γ-2 by the symmetry of Gγ(α). Since the valence of γ+2 in Gγ(α) is two, we have Gγ(α) is a Type II graph. Let c and d denote the two distinct edges connecting γ+1 to γ-1. We compute

[formula]

It follows from wα2(a)  ≠  0 that ι(α2,γ')  ≤  ι(α2,γ). If this inequality is strict, then (α,β,γ) is not minimal. Otherwise, we assume ι(α2,γ')  =  ι(α2,γ). Since wα1(e)  =  0, Gγ(α1) is a Type III graph. Thus, if wα1(a)  ≠  0, then ι(α1,γ')  <  ι(α1,γ) so that C(α,β,γ')  <  C(α,β,γ). Otherwise, wα1(a)  =  0 and thus ι(α1,γ')  =  ι(α1,γ). Now, since γ' is the result of surgery on a wave for (β,γ), we have ι(β,γ')  <  ι(β,γ) in addition to ι(α2,γ')  =  ι(α2,γ) and ι(α1,γ')  =  ι(α1,γ); hence C(α,β,γ')  <  C(α,β,γ).

In the second case, we suppose that e connects γ+2 to γ-2. If the valence of γ±1 in Gγ(α2) is one, then (α,β,γ) is not minimal by Lemma [\ref=g2wave]. Otherwise, the valence of γ±1 is greater than one in Gγ(α), and since the valence of γ+2 is two, Gγ(α) is a Type I graph with one cross-seam; equivalently, Gγ(α) is a square graph. Here we let c denote the single edge connecting γ+1 and γ-1. As above, we compute

[formula]

If wα2(a)  >  1, then ι(α2,γ')  <  ι(_2A,γ) and (α,β,γ) is not minimal. On the other hand, if wα2(a)  =  1, then ι(α2,γ)  =  ι(α2,γ'), while Gγ(α1) is a Type III graph, which implies C(α,β,γ')  <  C(α,β,γ) as above.

Case 4: wα2(a)  =  wα2(e)  =  0. If wα(a)  =  wα(e)  =  0, then Lemma [\ref=crossseam] implies that (α,γ) is trivial. If one of wα(a) or wα(e) is zero, then Gγ(α) is a Type III graph and (α,β,γ) is not minimal by Lemma [\ref=gwave]. Otherwise, wα1(e)  =  1 and wα1(a)  ≠  0. Suppose first that e is a cross-seam, so that by the symmetry of Gγ(α1), there is another weight one cross-seam e' which meets γ-2. Since the valence of γ±2 is two and Gγ(α) contains two distinct cross-seams, the graph Gγ(α) is a Type II graph (as in Figure [\ref=fig:a2graphs](a)). Let c and d denote the edges connecting γ+1 to γ-1, let γ3  =  Δa, and let γ'  =  {γ2,γ3} so that γ' is related to γ by a handle slide. Then ι(α2,γ3)  =  ι(α2,γ1)  =  wα2(c)  +  wα2(d), and, using wα1(e)  =  wα1(e')  =  1, we compute

[formula]

Thus, if wα1(a)  >  1, then ι(α1,γ')  <  ι(α1,γ) so that C(α,β,γ')  <  C(α,β,γ). Otherwise, wα1(a)  =  1 and thus ι(α1,γ')  =  ι(α1,γ). As above, since γ' is the result of surgery on a wave for (β,γ), we have ι(β,γ')  <  ι(β,γ); hence C(α,β,γ')  <  C(α,β,γ).

In the second subcase, suppose that e is a seam connecting γ+2 to γ-2. Since an α2-arc contributes an edge, call it c, connecting γ+1 to γ-1 in Gγ(α), it follows that Gγ(α) is a Type I graph with only one cross-seam (see Figure [\ref=fig:a2graphs](b)); that is, Gγ(α) is a square graph. Moreover, wα2(a)  =  wα2(e)  =  0 implies ι(α2,γ2)  =  0, so by Lemma [\ref=missedcase], we have (α,γ) is not a Heegaard diagram for S3, a contradiction.

In the two lemmas that follow, we return our attention to Gα(β,γ). These two lemmas, together with our previous work in this section, prove Proposition [\ref=claim1] in all but one exceptional case. This case is significantly more complicated and requires the arguments in Sections [\ref=sec:digress] and [\ref=sec:hard_case] to settle.

If wγ(b)  ≠  0 in Gα(γ), then (β,γ) does not contain a wave based in β.

Observe that there is an arc β* of β2 which connects α+2 to a point p contained in an arc γ0 in the edge b+ of [formula]. See Figure [\ref=fig:wb=0](a). Since m  ≥  3, we have that β1 intersects arcs in the edge a essentially, which implies that β1 meets γ0 in a nonempty set of pairs of oppositely oriented points. It follows that γ0 contains a wave-busting arc γ* containing the point p; hence Gβ(γ) does not contain a wave by Lemma [\ref=sat].

We now assume that [formula]. Recall that the homeomorphism ψ described in Section [\ref=sec:prelims] maps Gα(γ) onto itself.

If [formula], then (β,γ) does not contain a wave based in β or (α,β,γ) is not minimal.

First, we note that wγ(a), wγ(c), and wγ(d) are not zero; otherwise, Gγ(α) is a c-graph and contains a wave by Lemma [\ref=12gon], so (α,β,γ) is not minimal by Lemma [\ref=gwave]. To prove the lemma, we will view Σα as two unit squares I and I' glued together along their boundaries with a neighborhood of their vertices removed. We describe points in I with Cartesian coordinates, where α-1  =  (0,0). First, suppose that [formula] and 1  <  m  <  |n|  -  1. Let β*2 denote the arc of [formula] which meets the vertex of I at the coordinates (1,0). Since the slope of β*2 is [formula], the coordinates of the other endpoint of β*2 are [formula]. In I, there are two arcs of β1, call them β1' and β1'', which are adjacent to β*2. The endpoints of β1' and β1'' are given by

[formula]

See Figure [\ref=fig:wb=0](b). The assumption that 1  <  m  <  |n| - 1 ensures that none of these four endpoints is a vertex of I. In addition, we note that in I', the endpoints [formula] and [formula] are connected by an arc in β1. Thus, an arc in [formula] which has slope [formula] contains a subarc γ* connecting oppositely oriented points of intersection with β1, [formula] and [formula]. Further, γ* meets β2 precisely once in the point [formula]. Therefore, γ* is a wave-busting arc and (β,γ) does not contain a wave by Lemma [\ref=sat].

For the other cases, we will show that by applying the homeomorphism ψ to Σα, we can reduce the argument to the one above. Since ψ preserves Gα(γ), we need only determine the action of ψ on the slope of [formula] of arcs in β. Suppose that either [formula] or [formula] and m  >  |n|  +  1. We have

[formula]

If [formula], then certainly [formula] and m  <  2m + n - 1. Hence, the above argument shows that there exists a wave-busting arc γ*  ⊂  γ, so (β,γ) does not contain a wave based in γ. Now, suppose that n  <  0 and m  >  |n|  +  1 and let k  =  2m  +  n  =  2m - |n|, so that k  >  m + 1 and thus m  <  k - 1. Once again, we have that [formula] is of the form handled by the above argument, and we conclude that (β,γ) does not contain a wave based in β.

The remaining case to consider in the proof of Proposition [\ref=claim1] occurs when [formula], and we postpone our examination of this case until Section [\ref=sec:hard_case].

A brief digression into square graphs

Recall some of the assumptions and conclusions we have made up to this point. First, (α,β,γ) is minimal, and so neither Gγ(α) nor [formula] is a Type III graph. Second, the weight wγ(b) = 0 in Gα(γ), which is a Type III graph. This implies that α and γ can be oriented so that all points of intersection occur are coherently oriented; in other words, (α,γ) is a positive Heegaard diagram. In this case, we consider Gγ(α).

The graph Gγ(α) is a square graph.

Since Gγ(α) does not contain a wave by assumption, we know that it falls under Type I or Type II. Refer to Figure [\ref=fig:WhGraphs]. In addition, (α,γ) is a positive Heegaard diagram, so all cross-seams in Σγ(α) originating from γ+1 and terminating in γ±2 must terminate in the same vertex, say γ+2. Thus, Gγ(α) contains an edge connecting γ+1 to γ+2, its symmetric image connecting γ-1 to γ-2, and no edges connecting γ±1 to γ∓2. It follows that if Gγ(α) is a graph of Type II, then wα(b)  =  0 and Gγ(α) contains a wave, a contradiction. Thus, Gγ(α) is a graph of Type I and wα(b)  =  0, as desired.

Recall that we assume that the edges in a square graph or a c-graph have nonzero weights. By Lemma [\ref=crossseam], a graph for S3 with only two edges is trivial, and such a graph must be Type I with w(a) = w(b) = 0 and w(c) = w(d) = 1. In keeping with Figure [\ref=fig:WhGraphs], we will refer to the edges a± of a square graph as horizontal edges and the edges c and d as vertical edges. Note that if (δ,ε) is a positive Heegaard diagram for S3 such that Gδ(ε) is a square graph, then Gδ(ε) is not a Type III graph and as such, there is no wave based in δ for (δ,ε). By Theorem [\ref=wave], it follows that there must be a wave based in ε. In this setting, we may keep track of the structure of Gδ(ε) after doing wave surgery.

Suppose that (δ,ε) is a positive Heegaard diagram for S3 such that Gδ(ε) is a square graph, and let (δ,ε') be the result of doing wave surgery on (δ,ε). Then Gδ(ε') is either a square graph or a c-graph.

Let δ  =  {δ1,δ2}, ε  =  {ε1,ε2}, and ε'  =  {ε2,ε3}. Observe that ε3 can be embedded disjointly from ε and consider [formula]. The curve ε3 may introduce at most one additional edge; however, doing wave surgery introduces no new points of intersection and does not change the sign of existing intersection points. Therefore, (δ,ε') remains a positive diagram, and Gδ(ε') cannot have such an edge. Thus Gδ(ε') is a subgraph of Gδ(ε).

We must show that Gδ(ε') has more than two edges. Suppose by way of contradiction that Gδ(ε') has two edges, so that it is the trivial diagram. It follows that ι(δ,ε2) = 1, so we may assume that ι(δ1,ε2)  =  0. By Lemma [\ref=missedcase], (δ,ε) is not a Heegaard diagram for S3, a contradiction.

As an immediate consequence, we have the next lemma.

Suppose that (δ,ε) is a positive Heegaard diagram for S3 and Gδ(ε) is a square graph. Then there is a sequence of diagrams [formula] such that (δ,εi) is the result of wave surgery on (δ,εi + 1), the graph Gδ(εi) is a square graph for i  >  0, and Gδ(ε0) is a c-graph.

By Lemma [\ref=cgraph], Gδ(εl - 1) is either a square graph or a c-graph. By induction on (l - i), suppose that Gδ(εi) is square graph. Observe that (δ,εi) always contains a wave, that the wave must be based in εi, and that δ is preserved by the wave surgery. Since ι(δ,εi - 1)  <  ι(δ,εi), finitely many applications of Lemma [\ref=cgraph] yield the desired result.

Observe that for i > 0, [formula] is a collection of rectangles and two octagons whose sides alternate between arcs in δ and arcs in εi. It follows that Gεi(δ) is a Type III graph with wδ(b)  =  0 and all other edge weights nonzero. As such, there is a unique way to do wave surgery on εi, and so we call the sequence [formula] guaranteed by Lemma [\ref=reducing] the reducing sequence for ε (without ambiguity). See Figure [\ref=fig:SquareGraphs].

The involution of Σ maps one of the octagons cut out by δ and εi to the other octagon, and thus it suffices to examine one of the octagons, which we will call Oi. Since the diagram is positive, any wave or band for (δ,εi) must connect opposite arcs of εi contained in the boundary of Oi. We will call a wave ω parallel to a horizontal edge of Gδ(εi) a horizontal wave; otherwise ω is parallel to a vertical edge and we call ω a vertical wave. The notions of a horizontal band and vertical band are defined similarly.

Let ωi denote the wave for (δ,εi) such that surgery on ωi yields (δ,εi - 1), and let υi denote the band dual to each ωi (so that banding (δ,εi - 1) along υi yields (δ,εi)). Let εi  =  {εi1,εi2}. Note that ωi necessarily has endpoints in the same component of εi, whereas υi + 1 always connects εi1 to εi2. In addition, υi is vertical if and only if ωi is horizontal.

Every wave ωi is a horizontal wave.

The band υ1 is contained in the c-graph Gδ(ε0), and thus it must be a vertical band. It follows that ω1 is a horizontal wave. Suppose by way of induction that ωi is a horizontal wave in Gδ(εi). Since the band υi is also contained in Gδ(εi), we have that υi + 1 cannot be parallel to ωi since ωi connects the same component of εi while υi + 1 connects distinct components of εi. Thus, υi + 1 is vertical, which implies that its dual wave ωi + 1 is horizontal as well.

Here we introduce some terminology to better understand what happens to arcs of Σδ(εi) when two curves are banded together. We say that two arcs in Σδ(εi) are adjacent if they cobound a rectangle in [formula] with arcs in δ.

If εi3 is the result of banding εi1 to εi2 along υi + i, then ι(δ,εi3)  =  ι(δ,εi). In addition, in [formula] every arc of εi is adjacent to an arc of εi3.

In order to construct εi3 from εi1 and εi2 in Σδ, we begin with two parallel copies of εi1 and εi2 which have been pushed off of εi so that two of their horizontal arcs lie in the octagon Oi. Attaching the band υi + 1 to these two arcs transforms them into two vertical arcs and leaves all other arcs of εi unchanged, proving the first statement. Since the vertical band υi + 1 connects εi1 to εi2, we have wεij(a)  ≥  1 for j  =  1,2. Thus wεi(a)  ≥  2, and every arc of εi is adjacent to some arc of its push-off that has not been changed by attaching the band υi + 1. See Figure [\ref=fig:AltAdj].

Now, we return to the trisection diagram (α,β,γ). By Lemma [\ref=lemma:4cycle], Gγ(α) is a square graph, and, as such, α has a reducing sequence [formula] by Lemma [\ref=reducing]. The next lemma examines this reducing sequence more closely.

Suppose that α0 and αl have a curve α0* in common. Then (α,β,γ) is not minimal.

Let αl  =  {αl1,α0*}. If (α,β,γ) is minimal, then ι(α1,γ)  ≥  ι(α2,γ), and by Lemma [\ref=weights], ι(αl1,γ)  ≥  ι(α0,γ)  >  ι(α0*,γ). It follows that α1  =  αl1 and α2  =  α0*. In addition, we have that Gγ(α2) is a subgraph of the c-graph Gγ(α0). If Gγ(α2) contains a cross-seam, them (α,β,γ) is not minimal by Lemma [\ref=g2wave]. Otherwise, ι(α2,γj)  =  0 for either j = 1 or j = 2; therefore, (α,γ) is not a Heegaard diagram for S3 by Lemma [\ref=missedcase].

In order to deal with the intricacy of the remaining case in Section [\ref=sec:hard_case], we will need to keep track of the cyclic ordering of arcs at the vertices of Σα(γ). One way to obtain this information is to understand adjacency in Σγ(α), since the regions of [formula] appear in both graphs. We say that (αi,γ) has upper alternating adjacency (resp. lower alternating adjacency) if the horizontal boundary arc of Oi in the edge a+ (resp. a-) is adjacent to an arc in the opposite curve of αi. See Figure [\ref=fig:SquareGraphs]. If (αi,γ) has both upper and lower alternating adjacencies, we say that it has alternating adjacency. The remainder of the section includes several lemmas which establish that Gγ(α) has alternating adjacency.

If (αi,γ) has upper (resp. lower) alternating adjacency, then (αi + 1,γ) has upper (resp. lower) alternating adjacency.

By Lemma [\ref=hor], the band υi + 1 dual to the horizontal wave ωi + 1 is vertical. Let αi3 correspond to the curve created by banding αi1 to αi2 along υi + 1, so that αi + 1 is either {αi1,αi3} or {αi2,αi3}.

Let α*  =  {αi1,αi2,αi3} and consider [formula], letting O* denote the octagon in [formula] such that O*  ⊂  Oi + 1. By the proof of Lemma [\ref=weights], both vertical arcs of ∂O* in α* are in αi3, and ∂O* has one horizontal arc in each of αi1 and αi2; call these arcs α*1 and α*2, respectively. Suppose that α*1 is in the edge a+ (resp. a-). Then by Lemma [\ref=weights], α*1 is adjacent to an arc in αi3, which in turn is adjacent to an arc in αi2 by the upper (resp. lower) alternating adjacency of {αi,γ}. Thus, independently of whether αi1∈αi + 1 or αi2∈αi + 1, the diagram (αi + 1,γ) must also have upper (resp. lower) alternating adjacency. See Figure [\ref=fig:AltAdj].

Note that, in the proof of Lemma [\ref=adjpreserve], if αi1∈αi + 1, then we need not require that (αi,γ) have upper (resp. lower) alternating adjacency. The next lemma follows immediately.

If an arc in αij is in the upper (resp. lower) horizontal boundary of Oi and αij∈αi + 1, then (αi + 1,γ) has upper (resp. lower) alternating adjacency.

Now, we combine Lemmas [\ref=adjpreserve] and [\ref=adjnew] to determine adjacency for (α,γ) when (α,β,γ) is minimal.

If α0 and αl do not have a curve in common, then (αl,γ) has alternating adjacency.

Note that the band υ1 is vertical, so it connects α01 to α02. Suppose without loss of generality that υ1 connects an upper horizontal arc of α01 to a lower horizontal arc of α02, and suppose further that α01∈α1. By Lemma [\ref=adjnew], (α1,γ) has upper alternating adjacency, and by Lemma [\ref=adjpreserve], (αi,γ) has upper alternating adjacency for all i  >  0. Let k be the largest index such that α01∈αk, and suppose αk  =  {α01,αk2}. By assumption, k  <  l, and following the proof of Lemma [\ref=adjpreserve], we have that the upper horizontal boundary of Ok is an arc in α01 while the lower boundary is an arc in αk2. Since α01∉αk + 1, we have αk2∈αk + 1 and thus (αk + 1,γ) has lower alternating adjacency by Lemma [\ref=adjnew]. Finally, Lemma [\ref=adjpreserve] implies that (αi,γ) has lower alternating adjacency for all i  >  k, and thus (αl,γ) has alternating adjacency as desired.

In summary, we have the following.

If Gγ(α) is a square graph, then (α,γ) has alternating adjacency or (α,β,γ) is not minimal.

By Lemma [\ref=reducing], there is a reducing sequence [formula] for (α,γ). If αl and α0 have no curve in common, then (α,γ) has alternating adjacency by Lemma [\ref=nocommon]. Otherwise, (α,β,γ) is not minimal by Lemma [\ref=onearc].

The case in which m  =   - n  ±  1

Up to this point in the paper, our arguments have not required information about the cyclic ordering of the intersections of arcs with the fat vertices in Σα(β,γ). However, this case is significantly more delicate than the preceding ones, and thus we must be more precise about how we recover (α,β,γ) from Σα(β,γ). We will assume that β has been isotoped so that all inessential intersections between β and γ correspond to triangles based in α+1 or α+2.

Let us recall our current assumptions. First, neither diagram (α,γ) or (β,γ) is trivial, there is no wave based in γ, and the trisection diagram (α,β,γ) is minimal. Second, Gα(γ) is a Type III graph such that wb(γ)  =  0 and all other weights are nonzero. This implies that [formula] contains some number of rectangular regions and two octagonal regions, which we call O' and O''. Third, [formula] is a square graph with alternating adjacency and (α,γ) contains a wave based in α1. Fourth, by Lemma [\ref=nogwave] we may assume that (β,γ) does not contain a wave based in γ, so that it must contain a wave based in β. Finally, the slopes of the β-arcs in [formula] are both [formula]. Since the slopes of the β-arcs differ from the slopes of the γ-arcs, and since there are no inessential intersection points based at α-i, βi intersects α-i in an edge of either O' or O'' for i = 1,2.

If Gγ(α) has an edge of weight one, then (α,β,γ) is not minimal.

Suppose that in the square graph Gγ(α), one of the edges a±, c, or d has weight one (see Figure [\ref=fig:WhGraphs]). Note that each octagon O' and O'' contains three boundary components in α1 and one boundary component in α2. By Lemma [\ref=reducing], there is a hortizontal wave contained in Σγ(α), and so both vertical boundary arcs of O' in Σγ(α) are in α1. This means that O' has horizontal boundary arcs in both α1 and α2; thus wα(a)  ≥  2.

Consequently, we suppose without loss of generality that wα(d)  =  1. If wα2(d)  =  0, then Gγ(α2) is a Type III graph containing a cross-seam and (α,β,γ) is not minimal by Lemma [\ref=g2wave]. If wα2(d)  =  1, let γ3  =  Δa and let γ'  =  {γ2,γ3}. Then γ' is related to γ by a handle slide, so by the minimality of (α,β,γ), we have that ι(α2,γ)  ≤  ι(α2,γ') and thus ι(α2,γ1)  ≤  ι(α2,γ3). However, this implies that wα2(a)  +  wα2(c)  ≤  wα2(c)  +  1 and so wα2(a)  =  1 and ι(α2,γ)  =  ι(α2,γ'). By the above arguments, wα1(a)  >  0, and so

[formula]

This implies C(α,β,γ')  <  C(α,β,γ), as desired.

The next lemma uses our work from Section [\ref=sec:digress] to determine how β1 meets α+1 relative to γ in [formula].

For i = 1,2, the arc βi intersects α+i between parallel arcs of γ in the edge a+.

Let α*  ⊂  α1 denote the boundary arc of the octagon, say O', which contains the intersection of β1 with α-1, and observe by examination of Σα(γ) that in O' the arc α* is opposite an arc in α2. See Figure [\ref=fig:sec5_ExamplePair1]. By Lemma [\ref=hor], the wave ω for (α,γ) is horizontal, and thus opposite pairs of vertical arcs in Σγ(α) contained in ∂O' meet ω and are in the same curve α1. This implies that α* is a horizontal arc in one of a± in Gγ(α). Now, we invoke Lemma [\ref=alt], which asserts that (α,γ) has alternating adjacency. It follows that α* also cobounds a rectangular component R of [formula], and is opposite an arc of α2 in R. Since the only such rectangles in Σα(γ) lie between parallel arcs in the edge a+, the desired statement follows. A parallel argument shows that the same is true for β2 and α+2.

We note that if the weight of the edge a+ in Σγ(α) is large, then β1 and β2 will not necessarily intersect α+1 and α+2 between the same set of parallel arcs in the edge a+ in Σα(γ) as in Figure [\ref=fig:sec5_ExamplePair1]. We will also keep track of how β and γ intersect near the vertices α+i, but we require the following lemma first.

All essential points of [formula] are coherently oriented.

Consider Σα(β,γ). Choose an orientation for γ and note that since (α,γ) is a positive diagram, each arc corresponding to a single edge in Gα(γ) has the same orientation. Thus, we may orient the edges of Gα(γ) so that oriented arcs originate in α+1 and α-2 and terminate in α-1 and α+2. Now, we may orient β1 and β2 so that all essential points of intersection of β and the edge a+ are coherently oriented. The involution J preserves β1 and β2 setwise while reversing their orientations; hence essential points of [formula] and [formula] are coherently oriented. Since the slope [formula] of β is negative, it follows that essential points of [formula] and [formula] are coherently oriented as well. Finally, the homeomorphism ψ of Gα(β,γ) swaps γ-arcs in the edge c with those in the edge d while preserving their orientations and maps β-arcs of slope [formula] to arcs of slope [formula]. Thus, by applying ψ to Gα(β,γ), we may make a parallel argument that all essential points of [formula] and [formula] are coherently oriented. We conclude that all essential intersections of β and γ in Gα(β,γ) are coherently oriented. See Figure [\ref=fig:sec5_ExamplePair1] and Figure [\ref=fig:sec5_FirstWave](a).

Now, we define the winding of βj relative to γ at αi, denoted Wi(βj) (or simply Wi when the relevant β-curve is clear), to be the number of inessential intersections (counted with sign) of β and γ that are vertices of triangles based in α+i divided by ι(αi,γ) for i = 1,2. An inessential intersection is positive if it is coherently oriented with the essential points of intersection and negative otherwise. In the next four lemmas, we place restrictions on the values of W1 and W2 by showing that certain combinations of windings imply that (α,β,γ) is not minimal or (β,γ) does not contain a wave based in β, which contradicts our prior assumptions.

If W1 or W2 is an integer, then (α,β,γ) is not minimal.

If the winding of β relative to γ at α1 is an integer, then the two octagonal regions of [formula] are separated by a single arc contained in α1. It follows that in the square graph Gγ(α), one of the edges has weight one and thus (α,β,γ) is not minimal by Lemma [\ref=weightone].

If Wi  <  0 for either i = 1 or i = 2, then [formula] does not contain a wave.

Consider Σα(β,γ) and note that there is a subarc of a γ-arc contained in the edge a+ with endpoints in essential intersections of β1 and β2; thus Gβ(γ) contains an edge connecting β+1 to β+2. For any arc of γ originating from α+1, its first essential intersection is with β2. Suppose that [formula] contains an inessential point of intersection based in α+1 which is oriented opposite the essential points of intersection. Then there is an arc of γ connecting an inessential point of intersection with β1 with an oppositely oriented essential point of intersection with β2. It follows that Gβ(γ) contains an edge connecting β+1 to β-2, and by the argument of Lemma [\ref=sat], Gβ(γ) does not contain a wave.

A similar argument shows that if [formula] has an oppositely oriented inessential intersection point based in α+2, then Gβ(γ) again does not contain a wave.

It follows that Wi  >  0 for i = 1,2; hence, (β,γ) is a positive diagram, and Gγ(β) is a square graph.

If 0  <  Wi  <  1 for both i  =  1,2, then Gβ(γ) does not contain a wave.

If 0  <  W1  <  1, then there is an arc γ' in γ whose endpoints lie in α+1 and β2. See Figure [\ref=fig:sec5_NoWinding](a). By assumption, there are no inessential intersections of β and γ based at α-1, and so every arc of γ with an endpoint on α-1 meets β2. Thus, the endpoint of γ' in α+1 is the endpoint of another arc γ'' connecting α-1 to β2, and in the graph Gβ(γ), the arc [formula] is in an edge connecting β+2 to β-2.

A parallel argument shows that if 0  <  W2  <  1, then Gβ(γ) contains an arc in an edge connecting β+1 to β-1. Together, these two arcs consitute a wave-busting pair, and by Lemma [\ref=sat], we have that Gβ(γ) does not contain a wave.

If Wi  >  1 for both i  =  1,2, then Gβ(γ) does not contain a wave.

If W1  >  1, then there is an arc of γ emanating from α+1 that meets β in two consecutive inessential points of [formula] which are coherently oriented. See Figure [\ref=fig:sec5_NoWinding](b). Such an arc contributes an edge connecting β+1 to β-1 in Gβ(γ). Similarly, if W2  >  1, then Gβ(γ) contains an edge connecting β+2 and β-2, and thus Gβ(γ) contains a wave-busting pair. We conclude that Gβ(γ) does not contain a wave by Lemma [\ref=sat].

Thus, we are left with two cases: Wi  >  1 and 0  <  Wj  <  1 for {i,j}  =  {1,2}. Unfortunately, in both of these cases it is possible for (β,γ) to admit a wave based in β, and so a more sophisticated argument is required - especially since the result β' of wave surgery on β no longer satisfies ι(α,β')  =  2. Hence, we must appeal to a line of reasoning other than that involving minimal complexity C(α,β,γ). In the remaining two lemmas, we complete the proof of Proposition [\ref=claim1] by using Lemma [\ref=reducing] to determine that (β,γ) is not a Heegaard diagram for S3.

If W1  >  1 and 0 < W2  <  1, then (β,γ) is not a Heegaard diagram for S3.

First, we note that (β,γ) contains a wave ω: Since W1  >  1, an octagonal component O' of [formula] contains an arc β* of β1, both of whose endpoints are inessential points of [formula], such that there is an arc ω which avoids [formula] in its interior, has one endpoint on β*, meets α-2 in a single point contained in O*, and continues through a rectangular component of [formula] to meet β1 in an oppositely oriented point. See Figure [\ref=fig:sec5_FirstWave](a).

As depicted in Figure [\ref=fig:sec5_FirstWave](b), we let β3 denote the new curve created by doing surgery on β1 along ω. The curve β3 intersects Gα(β,γ) in two arcs, each having slope [formula]. Further, W1(β3)  =  W1(β1)  -  1 while W2(β3)  =  1  -  W2(β2). Let β'  =  {β2,β3}. We claim that (β',γ) does not contain a wave based in γ. By Lemma [\ref=weightone], each edge c and d of Gγ(α) has weight at least two, which implies that [formula] contains two rectangles R1 and R2 such that Ri has two opposite boundary components contained in γi. See Figure [\ref=fig:sec5_RectBust]. Since the slope of β2 is [formula], we have that β2 intersects each edge of Gα(γ) essentially, and thus β2 meets R1 and R2 in arcs β1* and β*2. In Gγ(β'), the pair {β1*,β2*} is a wave-busting pair, and thus Gγ(β') does not contain a wave by Lemma [\ref=sat].

Now, suppose that W1(β1)  >  2, so that W1(β3)  >  1. In this case, as in the proof of Lemma [\ref=bothwind], there is an arc γ*3 of γ which meets β3 in its coherently oriented endpoints and avoids β' in its interior. In addition, 0  <  W2(β2)  <  1; hence there is an arc γ*2 contained in the edge a+ which meets β2 in its coherently oriented endpoints and avoids β' in its interior. See Figure [\ref=fig:sec5_WindingBust]. It follows that {γ*2,γ*3} is a wave-busting pair and Gβ'(γ) does not contain a wave by Lemma [\ref=sat]. In this case, we conclude that (β',γ), and therefore (β,γ), is not a Heegaard diagram for S3 by Theorem [\ref=wave].

On the other hand, suppose that 1  <  W1(β1)  <  2, so that 0 < W1(γ3)  <  1. In this case the situation is considerably more complicated. Suppose (by applying ψ if necessary and noting that ψ does not alter the values of W1 and W2) that the slope of β2 is [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=inter], the curve β2 has exactly [formula] essential intersections with each arc in the edges a±. Consider the arc ω' connecting α+1 to α-2 in the octagon O'. By the symmetry of Gα(β,γ) under the involution J and Lemma [\ref=exit], if we extend ω' through α1, it intersects α-1 between parallel arcs corresponding to the edge a-. See Figure [\ref=fig:sec5_BigExample]. Thus, ω' may be extended from α-1 and from α+2 to an arc ω* which avoids β3 and meets β2 in 2k points, where k of these points arise from the k essential intersections of β2 with a+ and the other k points arise from the intersections of β2 with a-. Moreover, each intersection point of the first type is naturally paired with an intersection point of the second type. For this reason, we will label the points of intersection of ω* with β2 as [formula].

We call the arc ω* a nested wave sequence, because it gives rise to k successive waves. Let ωi denote the subarc of ω* connecting p+i to p-i, so that ω*  =  ω1. Let β*k  =  β2 and let β'k  =  β'  =  {β*k,β3}. Observe that ωk is a wave for (β'k,γ) based in β*k, and let β'k  -  1  =  {β*k - 1,β3} be the result of doing surgery on β*k along ωk. Inductively, ω* gives rise a to sequence of wave surgeries: We will let β'i  =  {β*i,β3}, where β*i is the result of doing surgery on β*i + 1 along the wave ωi + 1 for the diagram β'i + 1. See Figure [\ref=fig:sec5_WaveSequence].

Observe that by construction, the curve β*0 does not intersect the edge a+ essentially; however, for i  ≥  1, we have that β*i intersects all edges of Gα(γ) essentially. As in the argument for the above case (shown in Figure [\ref=fig:sec5_RectBust]), it follows that for i  ≥  1, β*i intersects the rectangles R1 and R2 in a wave-busting pairs; thus Gγ(β'i) does not contain a wave by Lemma [\ref=sat]. Lemmas [\ref=12gon] and [\ref=cgraph] then imply that Gγ(β'i) is a square graph, and so [formula] is contained in the reducing sequence for β with respect to γ guaranteed by Lemma [\ref=reducing]. Therefore, Gγ(β'0) is either a square graph or a c-graph and as such (β0',γ) contains a wave based in β0'.

Now, each arc of β*0 has nonzero winding relative to γ at both α-1 and α+2, and so there is an arc γ*0 that originates at the innermost inessential point of [formula] based at α+2, travels through α2, and extends from α-2 along an arc in the edge a- to meet β*0 and has coherently oriented endpoints. See Figure [\ref=fig:sec5_WaveSequence](b). In addition, by Lemma [\ref=exit], the curve β3 meets α+1 in a point between parallel arcs in the edge a+, and we have already established that 0 < Wi(β3) < 1 for i = 1,2. Thus, there is an arc γ*3 in the edge a+ that meets β3 in its coherently oriented endpoints. The pair (γ*0,γ*3) is a wave-busting pair for Gβ'0(γ), implying that (β0',γ) does not contain a wave based in β0' by Lemma [\ref=sat], contradicting our previous assumptions. This completes the proof of the lemma.

There is one final case to consider, which mirrors the proof of Lemma [\ref=onewind] almost exactly, and so we give an abbreviated proof.

If 0  <  W1  <  1 and W2  >  1, then (β,γ) is not a Heegaard diagram for S3.

The proof in this case is virutally identical to the proof of Lemma [\ref=onewind]. As above, (β,γ) contains a wave based in β: An arc connecting α+1 to α-2 extends to a wave ω based in β2. Let β'  =  {β1,β3} be the result of surgery on β along ω. If W2  >  2, then (β',γ) and thus (β,γ) is not a Heegaard diagram for S3. Otherwise, we find a nested wave sequence that gives rise to a partial reducing sequence [formula] for β with respect to γ, implying that (β'0,γ) contains a wave based in β'0, where β'0  =  {β*0,β3}. The only distinction in this proof is that the roles of γ*0 and γ*3 from the proof of Lemma [\ref=onewind] are reversed. Now, γ*0 is an arc in a+ connecting coherently oriented points of β*0 whereas γ*3 runs over α2 to connect coherently points of β3. See Figure [\ref=fig:84]. Of course, {γ*0,γ*3} remains a wave-busting pair for Gβ'0(γ), a contradiction.

We summarize the previous three sections.

Suppose that (α,β,γ) is a minimal diagram for the genus two trisection [formula] which satisfies ι(α,β)  =  2, and suppose by way of contradiction that (α,γ) is not the trivial diagram. By the minimality of (α,β,γ), the diagram (β,γ) is also nontrivial. By Theorem [\ref=wave], there are waves for both (α,γ) and (β,γ). By Lemma [\ref=gwave], (α,γ) does not contain a wave based in γ, and so Gα(γ) is a Type III graph, and we parameterize the two arcs of β in Σα(β,γ) with slope [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=mone], we have m  ≠  1. In addition, Lemma [\ref=nogwave] asserts (β,γ) does not contain a wave based in γ; therefore, it must have a wave based in β, and so wγ(b)  =  0 in Gα(γ) by Lemma [\ref=bnotzero].

Lemma [\ref=nothard] then implies that [formula] must be [formula], the case dealt with in this section. Concerning the winding numbers W1 and W2 of β with respect to γ, Lemmas [\ref=noninteger], [\ref=sameint], [\ref=nonewind], and [\ref=bothwind] yield that Wi  >  1 and 0  <  Wj  <  1 for {i,j}  =  {1,2}. However, Lemmas [\ref=onewind] and [\ref=twowind] show that, in these two cases, (β,γ) is not a Heegaard diagram for S3, a contradiction. We conclude that (α,γ) must be the trivial diagram.

The case in which ι(α,γ)  =  2

Proposition [\ref=claim1] reveals that a minimal trisection diagram (α,β,γ) for a (2,0)-trisection satisfies ι(α,β)  =  ι(α,γ)  =  2. In this section, we show that, in addition, ι(β,γ) must also equal 2, which will complete the proof of the main theorem. The strategy is to consider the graph Σα(β,γ), in which each of curve in [formula] contributes a single arc, and the slopes of β-arcs agree and the slopes of the γ-arcs agree. We may suppose without loss of generality that the γ-arcs have slope [formula] and that the β-arcs have slope [formula], where m is odd and n is even. Although this choice is somewhat non-standard (it seems more natural to let slopes of γ-arcs vary) this convention allows us to import techniques from Section [\ref=sec:hard_case] more consistently. We will orient β and γ so that oriented arcs in Σα(β,γ) originate in α-i and terminate in α+i, as shown in Figure [\ref=fig:sec6_slopes].

Recall the homeomorphisms φ and φ- 1 of [formula] defined in Section [\ref=sec:prelims] and given by matrices

[formula]

Note that these homeomorphisms preserve γ setwise but exchange α+2 and α-2, which results in a reversal of orientations of β2 and γ2. When we apply such a homeomorphism, we will always re-label vertices and re-orient the curves in β and γ to match the conventions given above. See Figure [\ref=fig:sec6_automorphisms].

The slope [formula] for β may be chosen so that [formula].

Observe that φ±  1 preserves γ and takes the slope [formula] of β to [formula]. Since there exists an integer m' such that [formula] and [formula], we may map β-arcs to arcs of slope [formula] by repeated applications of either φ or φ- 1, as desired.

As in previous sections, we will systematically rule out various configurations of β and γ in [formula] until the only remaining cases are the ones in which ι(β,γ)  =  2, shown in Figure [\ref=fig:StdDiags].

If m  >  1, then (β,γ) is not a Heegaard splitting of S3.

We will show that there are wave-busting arcs contained in both β and γ, implying that (β,γ) does not contain a wave. By applying the horizontal reflection H if necessary, we may suppose without loss of generality that [formula]. Then, [formula] and by hypothesis, m  >  1. Thus, by an argument identical to that of Lemma [\ref=nothard], there exists a wave-busting arc γ*  ⊂  γ1 for (β,γ) whose endpoints q1 and q2 are oppositely oriented points in [formula]. However, in this situation, q1 and q2 also cobound an arc β*  ⊂  β1 which meets γ2 in a single point, so that β* is a wave-busting arc for (β,γ). See Figure [\ref=fig:sec6_winding](a). By Lemma [\ref=sat], neither Gβ(γ) nor Gγ(β) contains a wave, and thus (β,γ) is not a Heegaard diagram for S3 by Theorem [\ref=wave].

We will assume for the remainder of the section that m  =  1. As in Section [\ref=sec:hard_case], for simplicity we will isotope β so that all inessential intersections of β and γ are based in α+1 and α+2, and we define the winding Wi of βi relative to γi at αi as above. The main difference in this case is that ι(αi,γ)  =  1, so Wi is a (signed) integer.

If |Wi|  >  1 for both i = 1,2, then (β,γ) is not a Heegaard splitting of S3.

If |Wi|  >  1, then there is an arc γ*i  ⊂  γi which meets βi in its coherently oriented endpoints and avoids β in its interior. See Figure [\ref=fig:sec6_winding](b). Thus, (γ*1,γ*2) is a wave-busting pair and Gβ(γ) does not contain a wave by Lemma [\ref=sat]. Let p1,p2 denote the endpoints of γ*1 and q1,q2 denote the endpoints of γ*2. Note that there are arcs β*1  ⊂  β1 and β*2  ⊂  β2 which have endpoints on p1,p2 and q1,q2, respectively, and which avoid γ in their interiors. Thus, (β*1,β*2) is also wave-busting pair, and we conclude that (β,γ) does not contain a wave and, as such, is not a Heegaard splitting of S3.

Recall from Section [\ref=sec:start] the definition of the 0-replacement for a set of curves δ such that Σα(δ) contains two arcs of slope [formula].

Suppose W2  =  0. If β3 and γ3 are the 0-replacements for β and γ, respectively, then ι(β2,γ3)  =  ι(β3,γ2)  =  1. In addition, if W1(β1)  ≥  2, then ι(β3,γ3)  =  W1(β1) - 2.

The fact that ι(β2,γ3)  =  ι(β3,γ2)  =  1 is clear from Figure [\ref=fig:sec6_even_odd]. Let k  =  W1(β1)  ≥  2, and suppose first that k is even. Isotope β1 so that [formula] of the inessential intersections of β1 and γ1 are based at α+1 and [formula] are based at α-1, and so that [formula]. Then β3, isotoped to remain disjoint from β1, has precisely [formula] essential intersections with γ3 based at α+1 and precisely [formula] based at α-1, yielding ι(β3,γ3)  =  k - 2. See Figure [\ref=fig:sec6_even_odd](a).

If k is odd, isotope β1 so that one inessential intersection of β1 and γ1 is contained in α1, [formula] are based at α+1, and [formula] are based at α-1. Then β3 may be isotoped so that one inessential intersection of β3 and γ3 is contained in α1; otherwise, β3 and γ3 have [formula] inessential intersections based at α+1 and [formula] based at α-1. Thus, in this case as well, ι(β3,γ3)  =  k - 2. See Figure [\ref=fig:sec6_even_odd](b)

Finally, we use the techniques developed up to this point to prove that if (α,β,γ) is a minimal trisection diagram, then each Heegaard diagram (α,β), (α,γ), and (β,γ) is standard, from which the main theorem follows.

If (α,β,γ) is a minimal diagram for a (2,0)-trisection [formula], then ι(α,β)  =  ι(α,γ)  =  ι(β,γ)  =  2 and (α,β,γ) is homeomorphic to one of the standard diagrams pictured in Figure [\ref=fig:StdDiags].

By Proposition [\ref=claim1], if (α,β,γ) is minimal, then ι(α,β)  =  ι(α,γ)  =  2. It only remains to show that ι(β,γ)  =  2. We may assume that in Gα(β,γ), the two γ-arcs have slope [formula], and by Lemmas [\ref=smallslope] and [\ref=bigm], the two β-arcs have slope [formula] for some even n. Additionally, by Lemma [\ref=muchwind], we may assume without loss of generality that |W2|  ≤  1.

First, suppose that |n|  ≥  4. If n  <  0, we may apply the horizontal reflection H; hence, we assume that n  >  0. By Lemma [\ref=inter], we have [formula] contains [formula] essential intersections, and, for i  ≠  j, [formula] contains [formula] essential intersections. Choose orientations on β and γ so that all essential intersections are coherently oriented. Since n  ≥  4, each of β1 and β2 intersects both γ1 and γ2 essentially. This implies that Gβ(γ) contains an edge connecting β+1 to β+2 and Gγ(β) contains an edge connecting γ+1 to γ+2. If [formula] contains an inessential point of intersection which is oriented opposite the essential intersections, then there is an arc β*1  ⊂  β1 connecting an inessential point of [formula] and an essential point of [formula]. Thus, Gγ(β) contains an edge connecting γ+2 to γ-1, and, by the arguments in Lemma [\ref=sat], Gγ(β) does not contain a wave. Similarly, γ1 contains an arc connecting an inessential point of [formula] to an essential point of [formula], thus Gβ(γ) does not contain a wave by the same reasoning. A parallel argument shows that if [formula] contains an inessential intersection oriented opposite the essential intersections, then neither Gγ(β) nor Gβ(γ) contains a wave, so by Theorem [\ref=wave], (β,γ) is not a Heegaard diagram for S3.

Therefore, we may assume that all points of [formula] are coherently oriented, so that Wi  ≥  0 for i = 1,2 and (β,γ) is a positive Heegaard diagram. If W2  =  1, then [formula]. But this implies that [formula] divides [formula], so that M(β,γ)  ≠  S3 by Lemma [\ref=determ], a contradiction. It follows that W2  =  0.

A similar argument shows that W1  ≠  1. If W1  ≥  2, let a be a seam of slope [formula], let α3  =  Δa, and let β3, and γ3 be the 0-replacements for β and γ, respectively, as in Figure [\ref=fig:sec6_even_odd]. In addition, let α'  =  {α1,α3}, β'  =  {β2,β3}, and γ'  =  {γ2,γ3}, so that ι(α',β')  =  ι(α',γ')  =  2. Using Lemma [\ref=replace], we compute

[formula]

In addition, we have

[formula]

By the minimality of (α,β,γ), we have

[formula]

and thus [formula], a contradiction.

The only remaining possibility in this case is that W1  =  0. However, this implies that the intersection matrix of (β,γ) is

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=determ], we have [formula], and so n  =  0 or n = 2, contradicting the assumption that n  ≥  4.

Now suppose that n = 2. In this case, intersection matrix for (β,γ) is

[formula]

It follows from Lemma [\ref=determ] that W1W2  =  2 or W1W2  =  0. We may observe that if W1,W2  ≤  0, we may replace β and γ with curves having the same slopes in [formula] and nonnegative winding by applying [formula] to [formula]. See Figure [\ref=fig:sec6_automorphisms]. Thus, suppose first that W2  =  1, so that W1  =  2. In this case, there is a sequence of handle slides that reduces complexity. To see this, let a be a seam of slope [formula], let α3  =  Δa, and let β3, and γ3 be the 0-replacements for β and γ, respectively, as in Figure [\ref=fig:0-replacements](a). In addition, let α'  =  {α1,α3}, β'  =  {β2,β3}, and γ'  =  {γ2,γ3}. Then, ι(α',β')  =  ι(α',γ')  =  2, but ι(β',γ') = ι(β,γ) - 3 = 2. It follows that the C(α',β'γ') < C(α,β,γ), a contradiction.

In the other remaining case, suppose that W2  =  0. If W1  ≥  2, we note that Inequality ([\ref=smallwind]) is true in this case as well, and thus [formula] by above arguments, a contradiction. If W1  =  1, then as above we perform handle slides in α, β, and γ to reduce complexity: Let a be a seam of slope [formula], let α3  =  Δa, and let β3, and γ3 be the 0-replacements for β and γ, respectively, as in Figure [\ref=fig:0-replacements](b). In this case, the handle slides are slightly different than above; let α'  =  {α2,α3}, β'  =  {β1,β3}, and γ'  =  {γ1,γ3}. Then ι(α',β')  =  ι(α',γ')  =  2, but ι(β',γ')  =  ι(β,γ)  -  1  =  2, contradicting that (α,β,γ) is minimal. The only remaining case when n  =  2 is that W1  =  W2  =  0; thus (α,β,γ) is the standard diagram in Figure [\ref=fig:StdDiags](a) (with β and γ reversed).

Finally, suppose that n  =  0, so that both the β and the γ arcs have the same slope. In this case

[formula]

and thus W1,W2  =    ±  1 by Lemma [\ref=determ]. It follows that (α,β,γ) is homeomorphic to one of the standard diagrams in Figures [\ref=fig:StdDiags](b) and [\ref=fig:StdDiags](c). (If W1 = W2 =  - 1, then apply H to recover Figure [\ref=fig:StdDiags](b).)

Cosmetic surgery, trisections, and exotic 4-manifolds

In the final section, we complete the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:main] by proving Proposition [\ref=21class]. We also explain and prove Corollary [\ref=cor:surgery].

Let [formula] be an n-component link in a compact 3-manifold Y and let Ti denote [formula] in the exterior YL of L, where [formula]. Suppose [formula] is a framing on L; that is, each ρi is a boundary slope in Ti. Let [formula] denote the 3-manifold obtained by Dehn surgery on L with slope [formula]. We will discuss surgeries having the property that [formula]. Clearly, [formula], and so this case is completely uninteresting. However, surgeries with the property [formula] and [formula] for all i are quite uncommon, and we call such a surgery cosmetic.

Now, suppose that X is a closed 4-manifold admitting a (g,k)-trisection. Then X has a handle decomposition consisting of one 0-handle, k 1-handles, g - k 2-handles, k 3-handles, and one 4-handle. Let X(i) denote the union of the handles of index at most i. By [\cite=laudenbach-poenaru], there is a unique way to attach the union of 3-handles and the 4-handle to the boundary of X(2), so [formula]. Let L denote the union of the attaching circles of the 2-handles. Then ∂X(2) is obtained from surgery on L in ∂X(1), and thus L is a (g - k)-component link in #  k(S1  ×  S2) with a cosmetic surgery.

We use this set-up to conclude our analysis of genus two trisections.

(2,1)-trisections are standard

If X admits a (2,1)-trisection, then X has a decomposition with one 1-handle, one 2-handle, and one 3-handle. The 2-handle, call it h, is attached along a knot L in S1  ×  S2, the framing of h gives a cosmetic surgery slope for L in S1  ×  S2. However, by work of Gabai, S1  ×  S2 admits no nontrivial cosmetic surgeries [\cite=gabai-I]. More specifically, we have the following theorem.

[\cite=gabai-I] Suppose L is a knot in S2  ×  S1 with a cosmetic surgery. Then L is a (  ±  1)-framed unknot.

A Heegaard splitting of a compact 3-manifold Y with boundary is a decomposition of Y as [formula], where C1 and C2 are compression bodies. We will require the following generalization of Haken's Lemma.

[\cite=haken] Let Y be a compact 3-manifold with a Heegaard splitting [formula], and suppose that D is a properly embedded disk in Y. Then there exists a disk D'  ⊂  Y such that ∂D'  =  ∂D and [formula] is a single simple closed curve.

For two distinct trisections (of arbitrary genus) [formula] and [formula], there is a natural trisection of the connected sum X'  #  X''. The easiest way to see this is to take the connected sum of trisection diagrams (Σ',α',β',γ') and (Σ'',α'',β'',γ''), which yields an induced trisection diagram [formula] for the natural trisection of X'  #  X''. Note that the induced diagram has the property that there is a separating curve in Σ  =  Σ'  #  Σ'' which bounds a compressing disk in each of the three 3-dimensional handlebodies determined by the three sets of attaching curves. In this case we call the trisection reducible. Conversely, if [formula] is a reducible trisection, then it can be written as the connected sum of trisections of 4-manifolds X' and X'' such that X  =  X'  #  X''. For more details, see [\cite=gay-kirby:trisections].

In the following proposition, we show that every (2,1)-trisection is reducible, and, as such, can be written as the conected sum of a (1,0)- and a (1,1)-trisection. Since the only X' admitting a (1,0)-trisection are [formula] and [formula], the only X'' admitting a (1,1)-trisection is S1  ×  S3, and the genus one trisections of these manifolds are unique up to diffeomorphism [\cite=gay-kirby:trisections], this completes the classification of (2,1)-trisections.

Every (2,1)-trisection is reducible.

Let [formula] be a (2,1)-trisection with trisection surface Σ. As described above, X admits a handle decomposition with one 1-handle, one 2-handle which we will call h, and one 3-handle. Let [formula]. By Lemma 13 of [\cite=gay-kirby:trisections], there is a trisection diagram (α,β,γ) for the trisection so that (α,β) is a Heegaard diagram for [formula], the Heegaard diagram (α,γ) satisfies ι(α1,γ1)  =  1 and α2  =  γ2, and h is attached to Y along γ1 with framing given by the surface framing of γ1 in Σ.

Let [formula] and [formula] be the 3-dimensional handlebodies determined by α and β, respectively, so that [formula] is the handlebody determined by γ. We will show that there is a separating curve δ  ⊂  Σ which bounds a disk in each of H12, H13, and H23. By Theorem [\ref=cosm], γ1 bounds a disk in [formula], and γ1 has surface framing ±  1 in Σ. Since ι(α1,γ1)  =  1 and α1 bounds a disk in H12, a positive or negative Dehn twist of γ1 about α1 yields a curve β* which has surface framing zero and is isotopic in H12 to γ1. Note that β* is also isotopic to a core of H12 and that ι(α1,β*)  =  ι(γ1,β*)  =  1.

Since β* is a 0-framed unknot in Σ, there is an embedded disk D  ⊂  Y such that ∂D  =  β* and a collar neighborhood of ∂D is disjoint from Σ. Let D' be the image of D under an isotopy which pushes β* slightly into the interior of H12, and let β'  =  ∂D'. Then β' is a core of H12 and [formula] is a compression body. In addition, let [formula], so that [formula] is a compressing disk for [formula] with boundary in T. Then [formula] is a Heegaard splitting satisfying the hypotheses of Lemma [\ref=haken]. It follows that there is a disk D0 properly embedded in [formula] such that [formula] and such that D0 intersects Σ in a single simple closed curve β0. This implies that β0 bounds a disk in H13.

The compression body C may be viewed as the union of product neighborhood T  ×  I, where T  =  T  ×  {0}, and a three-dimensional 1-handle attached along T1  =  T  ×  {1} whose cocore is a disk bounded by α2 in H12. By construction, there are annuli [formula] and [formula] such the boundary of A' in T agrees with the boundary of A0 in T, while [formula] and [formula]. Moreover, since T is incompressible in C, these annuli are incompressible. By a standard innermost disk and outermost arc argument, each annulus may be isotoped into T  ×  I so that it is vertical with respect to the product structure T  ×  I. It follows that, after isotopy, β* and β0 are disjoint and thus isotopic in T1, although (depending on where the 1-handle is attached) β* and β0 may not be isotopic in Σ  =  ∂+C. See Figure [\ref=fig:ThreeFrames](a).

Since β* is the result of Dehn twisting γ1 around α1, we have [formula]. The same may not be true for α1 and γ1 with respect to β0; in fact it is possible that ι(α1,β0),ι(γ1,β0)  >  1. See Figure [\ref=fig:ThreeFrames](a). However, there are curves α0 and γ0 isotopic to α1 and γ1 in T1 such that ι(α0,β0)  =  ι(α0,γ0)  =  ι(β0,γ0)  =  1 and β0 is the result of Dehn twisting γ0 around α0. Moreover, by virtue of this isotopy, there is a sequence of handle slides over α2 taking α1 to α0. Likewise, there is a sequence of handle slides over γ2  =  α2 taking γ1 to γ0, as in Figures [\ref=fig:ThreeFrames](b) and [\ref=fig:ThreeFrames](c). We conclude that α0, β0, and γ0 bound disks in the handlebodies determined by α, β, and γ.

Let [formula]. Since α0 bounds a disk Δ  ⊂  H12, we have δ bounds a disk in H12 consisting of two copies of Δ banded together along γ0. A similar argument shows that γ0 bounding a disk in H23 implies that δ bounds a disk in H23 as well. Finally, we note that δ is also equal to [formula]. Thus, since β0 bounds a disk in H13, the separating curve δ also bounds a disk in H13. It follows that the trisection is reducible, completing the proof.

Cosmetic 3-sphere surgeries and exotic 4-manifolds

Although neither S3 nor S2  ×  S1 admits a cosmetic surgery on a knot L, the situation is quite different when L is a 2-component link, leading to the following natural question.

Which 2-component links in 3-sphere admit a nontrivial cosmetic Dehn surgery?

Properties of these links are studied in [\cite=mos] (in which they are called reflexive), and Ochiai classifies 2-bridge links with cosmetic surgeries in [\cite=ochiai:cosmetic].

Suppose that L  ⊂  S3 is such a link, so that [formula]. If [formula], then there is an associated closed 4-manifold X obtained by first attaching (ρi)-framed 4-dimensional 2-handles to B4 along L  ⊂  S3  =  ∂B4, and next capping off the resulting 3-sphere with a 4-dimensional 4-handle. Since X is simply-connected, a theorem of Whitehead tells us that the homotopy type of X is determined by the symmetric, bilinear intersection form QX. See [\cite=gs] for complete details. Since X is closed, QX is unimodular, and since b2(X) = 2, there are only three choices:

[formula]

By Freedman [\cite=freedman] [\cite=freedman-quinn], it follows that X is homeomorphic to either S2  ×  S2, [formula], or [formula]. Thus, one way to look for an exotic simply-connected 4-manifold X with b2(X)  =  2 is to limit the search to those X arising from a cosmetic surgery on a 2-component link L  ⊂  S3.

In this setting, we can apply the results of Theorem [\ref=thm:main] to place restrictions on such a link.

Let (Σ,α,β) be a genus two Heegaard diagram for S3, and let γ be a cut system for Σ with surface framing [formula]. Then (Σ,α,β,γ) is a (2,0)-trisection diagram if and only if [formula].

Let [formula] be the Heegaard splitting determined by (Σ,α,β), and note that we may construct [formula] by first gluing two 3-dimensional 2-handles to Hα along γ to get a compact 3-manifold [formula] and gluing two 3-dimensional 2-handles to [formula] along γ to get Hβ(γ), followed by attaching Hα(γ) to Hβ(γ) along their common 2-sphere boundary. In addition, Hα(γ) is a 3-ball if and only if (Σ,α,β) is a Heegaard diagram for S3, and a similar statement holds for Hβ(γ). Finally, [formula] if and only if both Hα(γ) and Hβ(γ) are 3-balls, completing the proof.

Suppose that L is a two-component link contained in a genus two Heegaard surface Σ for S3, and L admits a surface-framed cosmetic Dehn surgery. Let (Σ,α,β) be a diagram for the Heegaard splitting of S3 given by Σ. Then (Σ,α,β,L) is a (2,0)-trisection diagram by Lemma [\ref=cosmeticlink], so by Theorem [\ref=thm:main] there is a series of handle slides on α, β, and L taking (α,β,L) to one of the standard diagrams pictured in Figure [\ref=fig:StdDiags]. It follows that there is a series of handle slides on L contained in the surface Σ that converts L to a ±  1-framed unlink or a 0-framed Hopf link.

There is much active research devoted to finding exotic simply connected 4-manifolds with small b2. This corollary can be viewed as a lower bound of sorts on the complexity of link surgery descriptions of such manifolds. In particular, we see that such an exotic manifold cannot be obtained by surface-framed surgery on a two-component link with genus two bridge number zero.

Finally, we remark that this corollary may be compared to the Generalized Property R Conjecture for two-component links, which states that if a 2-component link L has a 0-framed #  2(S1  ×  S2) surgery, then there is a series of handle slides converting L to the 0-framed unlink. See [\cite=gst] for further details. For both the corollary and the conjecture, the statements involve taking a link L with a specified surgery and converting it to an obvious canonical example or examples with the same surgery via handle slides.
