A generalization of Thue's theorem to packings of non-equal discs, and an application to a discrete approximation of entropy

Gershon Wolansky

Introduction

By a disc we will always mean a circular disc in the plane, that is, the set of points in the plane whose distance from some point (the center of the disc) is smaller than or equal to a number r, the radius of the disc. A packing is a family of pairwise disjoint discs in [formula]. When a packing is contained in some bounded set S, then the density of the packing is the percentage of the volume of S that is covered by the sets of the packing. The notion of density of a packing is generalized also for unbounded sets S by exhausting them with bounded sets, usually the intersection of S with larger and larger cubes centered, say, at the origin.

The optimal unit disc packing in the plane is a celebrated classical problem that goes back to the 1663 famous Kepler's problem about the densest unit sphere packing in [formula]. In 1773 Lagrange proved that among all lattice packings, that is packing of unit discs where the sets of centers is a lattice, the densest one (the hexagonal lattice) has density [formula]. The densest unit disc packing problem in the plane, without any additional assumption, was solved only in 1910 by Thue [\cite=Th10] and ever since this result is known as Thue's theorem. Thue's proof was considered incomplete and a full complete proof of the theorem was given in 1943 by L. F. Tóth [\cite=T43]. Since then more proofs, each more elegant than the other, where presented, as this theorem and topic attracted quite some attention (see [\cite=SM44] [\cite=D64] [\cite=H92] [\cite=CW10]).

It is not hard to see that for any bounded (open) set S in the plane, one can find a packing of discs contained in S, not necessarily of the same radii, whose density is arbitrarily close to 1. Indeed, assume we are given a disc packing P in S of density α < 1. Consider the subset of S not covered by the discs in P and decompose it into squares covering at least half of its area. Inside each square we can place a disc covering at least half of the area of the square. Altogether if we add those discs to our packing P we get another packing whose density is at least [formula]. Equivalently, [formula]. We see from here that by repeating this procedure many times we can get disc packings with density β such that 1 - β is arbitrarily close to 0.

Therefore, the question of optimal disc packing with no further assumptions on the family of discs in the packing is not very interesting. There are, however, some works about packing of non-congruent discs. In [\cite=T53], Tóth observed that the optimal density of disc packing in the plane remains [formula] even if we allow the radii of the discs to be in the interval between 0.906 and 1. This interval has been extended to

Entropy approximation

In this section we introduce another motivation for Theorem [\ref=theorem:main], which is beyond the scop of combinatorial geometry. Here we describe the claim and sketch a proof. The interested reader may consult [\cite=CW] for a detailed discussion and further results. The non-interested reader may skip this section, since no part of it is needed in the rest of this text. However, to understand this section we need the definition of Cell(D) corresponding to a disc D, as defined in the first paragraph of section [\ref=sec3].

Consider the set B(Ω) of Borel probability measures on an "nice", compact set [formula] (we may assume it is a disc, or square). The entropy of a measure μ∈B(Ω) is defined as the Lebesgue integral

[formula]

where μ: = ρdx if such a density exists, or E(μ) =  +   ∞   if such a density does not exist.

Our object is to find a proper approximation of the entropy on the class of N - empirical measures:

[formula]

where [formula]. Let [formula].

Since Ω is a compact set, B(Ω) is compact with respect to the weak (C*b(Ω)) topology, that is, for every sequence {μj}∈B(Ω) there exists a subsequence μjk and a measure μ∈B(Ω) such that [formula] as k  →    ∞  , that is:

[formula]

for any bounded continuous φ on Ω. It is also evident that B∞(Ω) is dense in B(Ω) with respect to the weak topology.

Let [formula] where [formula] iff [formula] is an unordered sequence of N distinct points in Ω. Let N(X): = N iff [formula]. We first note that each μ∈B∞(Ω) can be identified with a point [formula]. Thus, a measure μ∈BN(Ω) can be identified with [formula] via [formula].

A Γ  -  approximation of the entropy E is a function [formula] such that

Given [formula], let ri(X) be half the minimal distance of xi to the rest of the points in X:

[formula]

We now pose the following result:

[formula]

is a Γ approximation of the entropy.

We now sketch the proof of Theorem [\ref=th2].

Let Di(X) be the disc of radius ri(X) centered at xi.

A partition rule W is defined as a mapping between [formula] to a partition of [formula] into an essentially disjoint sets. For [formula] the partition rule associate a collection of N(X) measurable sets [formula] such that

Given a partition rule W we may associate with every δX∈B∞(Ω) another measure μ∈B(Ω) which admits a density

[formula]

Here 1A(x) is the characteristic function for a set A, i.e 1A(x) = 1,0 if [formula] respectively.

We now define the approximation entropy corresponding to the partition rule [formula],

[formula]

as the entropy of ρWXdx associated with δX∈B∞(Ω):

[formula]

We show (cf. [\cite=CW]):

For any partition rule W verifying (a-d) above, EW is a Γ  -  approximation of the entropy.

It is not too difficult to find partition rules. Recall the definition of Voronoi tessellation corresponding to [formula]:

[formula]

Indeed, one can easily show that [formula] is a partition rule.

We now define another partition rule: Let cell(Di(X)) as defined in the first paragraph of section [\ref=sec3] below. We know that cell(Di(X)) are per-wise disjoint, while [formula] with a (possibly) strict inclusion. Thus, the partition X into {cell(Di(X))} is not a partition rule, since it may violate condition (b) above.

Let [formula]. Define

[formula]

It is now easy to see that W(X) so defined is a partition rule, verifying (a-d) above. In particular, EW as defined in ([\ref=EW]) under the partition rule ([\ref=mcpr]) is a Γ  -  approximation of the entropy, via Proposition [\ref=prop1].

By the proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem:main] (section [\ref=sec3] below) we find out that the area of cell(Di(X)) is not smaller than [formula], i.e [formula]. In addition we can show that for [formula] for which δX approximate (in C*(Ω)) a measure μ∈B(Ω) satisfying E(μ) <   ∞  , it follows that [formula] for only o(N(X)) of the points. So, we replace [formula] in ([\ref=EW]) by [formula], taking advantage of the monotonicity of ln , and obtain that E defined in Theorem [\ref=th2] is not smaller, assymptotically, than EW with W given by ([\ref=mcpr]). Thus E satisfies condition (i) of definition [\ref=gamma].

To verify condition (ii) we recall that a optimal ratio of [formula] is obtained for hexagonal grids. Given μ∈B(Ω), we can approximate it (in the weak topology) by a sequentially constant density. Then we construct an hexagonal grid on every domain in Ω on which this density is a constant. For the details of the proof see [\cite=CW].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem:main].

For every disc D in F we define a cell, that we denote by cell(D), in the following way. Denote by O the center of D and let r be the radius of D. For every D'∈F, different from D, let O' be the center of D' and let r' denote the radius of D'. Let [formula] be the line perpendicular to OO' such that the intersection point B of [formula] and the segment OO' satisfies [formula]. Notice that [formula] separates D and D' because |OO'|  ≥   max (2r,2r')  ≥  r + r'. Let H(D') denote the (open) half-plane determined by [formula] that contains D. Finally, define [formula].

Observe that for every disc D∈F we have D  ⊂  cell(D) and for any two discs D1,D2∈F we have [formula]. If all the discs in F are of the same radii, then the cells {cell(D)|D∈F} are just cells of the Voronoi diagram of the set of centers of the discs in F. For arbitrary family of discs, however, it is possible that the collection of cells cell(D) does not cover the plane.

In order to prove Theorem [\ref=theorem:main] we restrict our attention to a large ball B around the origin. Fix c to be any number strictly greater than [formula]. We would like to show that it is not possible to find larger and larger balls B such that the area of B contained in the union of all discs in F is more than c times the area of B.

Let B be a large ball of radius n. Because F has sub-linear radii growth we can discard from F all discs that are not contained in B. This is because the union of all discs in F intersecting the boundary of B is contained in an annulus of width o(n) whose area is o(n2) and therefore negligible with respect to the area of B. Because F is locally finite, B contains only finitely many discs in F. We discard from F all the discs that are not contained in B.

We claim that it is enough to show that the portion of the area of any disc D in its cell cell(D) is not greater than the portion of the area of a disc in its circumscribing hexagon, namely, [formula]. Indeed, let r denote the maximum radius of a disc in F and recall that r = o(n). Let B' be the ball concentric with B whose radius is equal to the radius of B plus r. Add to F many more artificial discs, each with extremely small radius, centered very densely at points on the boundary of B. Notice that F together with the additional artificial discs satisfies the conditions in Theorem [\ref=theorem:main]. Observe that for every disc D∈F that is not artificial the new cell(D) is a subset of the original cell(D) before the artificial discs were added to F. Notice moreover that the new cell(D) is fully contained in B'' which is a ball concentric with B whose radius is equal to the radius of B plus r + 1. Hence, if we show that every disc D in F cannot cover more than [formula] of the area of cell(D), this will show that the union of all non-artificial discs in F cannot cover more than [formula] of the area of B''. Observe that the difference between the area of B and the area of B' is o(n2) and is negligible compared to the area of B when B is a large ball (that is when n is large). This means that the union of all discs in the original family F cannot cover from B an area of at least c times the area of B for fixed [formula] and a ball B that is large enough.

Therefore, we will concentrate on showing that the portion of the area of any disc D in its cell cell(D) (we may assume that cell(D) is bounded) is not greater than the portion of the area of a disc in its circumscribing hexagon, namely, [formula]. (We note that [formula].)

To this end we will show something stronger. Fix a disc D∈F, denote its center by O, and assume without loss of generality that it is a unit disc. Notice that cell(D) is a convex polygon. We will show that for every edge e of cell(D) the portion of the area of D inside the triangle determined by O and e is at most [formula]. We further strengthen our statement as follows: Let C be the point on the line [formula] through e such that OC is perpendicular to [formula]. We will show that if A is a vertex of the edge e such that AC overlaps with e, then the portion of the area of D inside the triangle ΔOAC is at most [formula] (see Figure [\ref=fig:e_C]).

To see that this is indeed a stronger statement, let A and B be the two vertices of the edge e. We split into two possible cases. If C is a point in the segment AB, then both AC and BC overlap with e. Notice that [formula]. If C does not belong to the segment AB, then assume without loss of generality that B is a point in the segment AC. We claim that [formula]. The reason is that the expression [formula] is monotone decreasing in the distance of A from C, or equivalently in the angle [formula] (this is because [formula]). Therefore, [formula]. This implies

[formula]

We leave the verification of the last inequality to the reader.

Fix an edge e of cell(D) and let D1 be the disc in F that gives rise to the edge e, that is, [formula] contains e. Denote by A1 the point of intersection of [formula] and the line through OO1. Let A2 be one vertex of e.

We have [formula]. Denote by O1 the center of D1 and denote by r1 the radius of D1. Recall, because of the definition of cell(D) and the fact that the radius of D is equal to 1, that we have [formula]. Let D2 be the disc in F that gives rise to the edge e' of cell(D) that is adjacent to A2 but different from e. Denote by O2 the center of D2 and let r2 denote the radius of D2 (see Figure [\ref=fig:A1A2D1D2]).

For three points A,B, and C in [formula] we denote by f(A,B,C) the ratio between the area of [formula] and the area of the triangle ΔABC. We need to show that [formula]. Assume to the contrary that [formula].

[formula].

Proof. Notice that [formula]. It follows that we must have [formula] for otherwise [formula]. width4pt depth1pt

The following observation follows directly from our definitions:

Suppose S1 and S2 are two discs in F of radii r1 and r2, respectively, and let d be the distance between the centers of S1 and S2. Then the distance t from the center of S1 to [formula] is equal to [formula].

Proof. Indeed, this is because we have [formula]. width4pt depth1pt

The angle [formula] is greater than [formula].

Proof.

We will need the following observation:

Let D' be a disc in F with center O' and radius r'. Suppose that the line [formula] is at distance 1 + x from the center O of D. Then r' satisfies [formula]. Moreover, the distance between the O and O' satisfies: [formula].

Proof. Recall that the radius of D is equal to 1. Denote by t the distance from O' to [formula]. We have [formula]. Because 2r'  ≤  OO' = t + 1 + x = r'(1 + x) + (1 + x), we get

[formula]

On the other hand we also have 2  ≤  OO' = t + 1 + x = r'(1 + x) + (1 + x) implying

[formula]

To see the second part of the claim about the distance from O to O', By our construction of [formula], we have [formula]. Therefore, |OO'| = (1 + x)(1 + r') and hence, as a consequence of the first part of the claim, [formula]. width4pt depth1pt

We claim that

[formula]

To see this, let [formula]. By Claim [\ref=claim:0], [formula]. We have [formula] Notice that [formula] is monotone increasing function of α and hence (recall [formula]) [formula], implying ([\ref=eq:OA_2]).

As a consequence of ([\ref=eq:OA_2]), the distance from O to [formula] is at most 1.155. Moreover, the distance from O to A1 is smaller than the distance from O to A2 and therefore we also deduce that the distance from O to [formula] is at most 1.155. By Claim [\ref=claim:1], both distances from O to O1 and from O to O2 are at least 2 and at most [formula].

By Claim [\ref=claim:1] and the fact that the distance from O to both [formula] and [formula] is at most 1.155, we have that both r1 and r2 are at least [formula]. Hence |O1O2|  ≥  r1 + r2  ≥  1.46. Because 2  ≤  |OO1|,|OO2|  ≤  2.74 there are two extreme options. In one [formula] is at least as large as the angle at P in a triangle ΔPQR such that |PQ| = 2.74, |QR| = 1.46, and |PR| = 2. The cosine of this angle a satisfies [formula].

The other extreme case is where [formula] is at least as large as the angle at P in a triangle ΔPQR such that |PQ| = |PR| = 2.74 and |QR| = 1.46. The cosine of this angle a satisfies [formula]. width4pt depth1pt

Because [formula] is the angle generated between [formula] and (the right ray of) [formula] we have the following

The angle generated between [formula] and (the right ray of) [formula] is greater than [formula].

The next lemma will turn to be quite useful.

Let [formula] be a line parallel to [formula] that separates [formula] and D. In particular, [formula] is closer to O than [formula] is. Let A*1 be the intersection point of [formula] with the line through O and O1 and let A*2 be the intersection point of [formula] with the line [formula]. Then f(O,A1,A2)  ≤  f(O,A*1,A*2).

Proof. Denote by B the intersection point of [formula] and the line through O and O1. Let α denote the measure of the angle between [formula] and the (positive part of the) x-axis, that is, [formula]. Denote by x the angle [formula] (see Figure [\ref=fig:criticalD1]).

It is not hard to express f(O,A1,A2) as a function of x: We have [formula].

Notice that from the theorem of sines [formula]. Therefore, the area of ΔOA1A2 is equal to

[formula]

Since [formula], then up to positive constant multipliers that depend only on B, O, and α, this function is equal to [formula].

Let x' denote the angle [formula] Notice that x' > x. Therefore, in order to show that f(O,A1,A2)  ≤  f(O,A*1,A*2) it is enough to show that the function g(x) is an increasing function of x, or equivalently that g'(x)  ≥  0.

A direct attempt to prove g'(x)  ≥  0 leads to the equivalent inequality

[formula]

This reduces to

[formula]

and then to

[formula]

Using the fact that [formula], it will be enough to show that

[formula]

This is equivalent to

[formula]

This finally reduces to

[formula]

which is equivalent to x  ≤  α. This last inequality holds because we have [formula] (the first inequality is Claim [\ref=claim:0] and the second inequality is by Corollary [\ref=cor:alpha]). width4pt depth1pt

[formula].

Proof. We will show that if [formula], then [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lemma:lDD1], it is enough to consider the case where [formula] is tangent to D. In this case notice that if [formula], then [formula]. As we further increase [formula], the value of f(O,A1,A2) decreases. width4pt depth1pt

Reducing to the critical case

We say that D is critical if its radius, namely 1, is equal to [formula]. Intuitively speaking, we inflate D around its center as much as we can so that the conditions in Theorem [\ref=theorem:main] are still satisfied when restricting our attention only to the three discs D, D1, and D2.

In a similar way we define the notion of critical for D1 and D2. That is, D1 is critical if r1 is equal to [formula]. We say that D2 is critical if [formula].

In this subsection we will show that one can assume, without loss of generality, that all three discs D,D1, and D2 are critical. This reduction will simplify a lot the presentation of the rest of the proof.

Without loss of generality we will assume that O is the origin, O1 lies strictly above O on the y-axis and O2 lies in the half-plane {x < 0}.

It is easiest to see that we may assume that D2 is critical. Indeed, by increasing the value of r2 we push the line [formula] towards O, thus shifting the point A2 to the right. This increases the value of f(O,A1,A2) (see Figure [\ref=fig:criticalD2]). Formally, denote by x the angle [formula]. We have [formula]. This is a decreasing function of x. Hence, as A2 moves to the right x decreases and consequently f(O,A1,A2) increases.

Next, we claim that we may assume without loss of generality that D1 is critical. To see this notice that as we increase r1, we push the line [formula] towards O (this operation has an effect both on A1 and on A2). By Lemma [\ref=lemma:lDD1], as we push the line [formula] towards O, the value of f(O,A1,A2) does not decrease.

Finally, we claim that we may assume without loss of generality that D is critical. To see this. we will now show that the effect of increasing the radius of D is equivalent to keeping D a unit disc and pushing the lines [formula] and [formula] closer to O. Once we show this then the claim follows from Lemma [\ref=lemma:lDD1] because it is shown there that pushing [formula] closer to O (keeping [formula] fixed) increases f(O,A1,A2). If in addition we also push [formula] closer to O, then f(O,A1,A2) can only further increase.

To see the effect of increasing the radius of D, let D' be any other disc in F and let O' and r' be its center and radius, respectively. The distance d from O to [formula] satisfies [formula], namely, [formula]. If we increase the radius of D to be r > 1, then the new distance d' from O to [formula] satisfies [formula], namely, [formula]. Scaling back the picture so that D is again a unit disc, this distance reduces to [formula]. Because r > 1 we have [formula].

Concluding the proof

We henceforth assume that all three discs D,D1, and D2 are critical. We split into three cases according to which is the closest pair of centers among O,O1, and O2.

Case 1. |OO1|  ≤  |OO2|,|O1O2|. In this case, because D and D1 are both critical, the radii of both D and D1 are the same and are equal to [formula]. As we assume that D is a unit disc, the radii of both D and D1 are equal to 1 and hence |OO1| = 2. The discs D and D1 touch each other at A1 and [formula] is their common tangent at A1. Let A2' be the point on [formula] to the left of A1 such that [formula]. In order for f(O,A1,A2) to be greater than [formula] the line [formula] must cross [formula] at a point A2 to the right of A2'. Let D1' be the disc centered at O1 whose radius is 2 (double the radius of D1). The point O2, the center of D2, must lie outside D1' because of the assumptions in Theorem [\ref=theorem:main].

We will now show that we may assume without loss of generality that O2 lies on the boundary of D1'. Let O2' denote the intersection point of the line through O and O2 with the boundary of D1'. We will replace D2 with D'2, the disc of radius 1 centered at O'2. By Lemma [\ref=lemma:p3], [formula]. This implies that both points O2 and O'2 are closer to O1 than to O. We will show that O is closer to the line [formula] than to the line [formula] (see Figure [\ref=fig:case1]). This will imply that by replacing D2 with D'2 we push A2 further to the right (on [formula]) and therefore can only increase f(O,A1,A2).

Recall that as D2 is critical then r2, the radius of D2, is equal to [formula] (this is because |O2O1|  ≤  |O2O| and [formula]).

The distance d from O to [formula] satisfies [formula]. Therefore, [formula].

The distance d' from O to [formula] satisfies [formula] (this is because both D and D2' are unit discs and therefore [formula] is the perpendicular bisector of OO2').

We claim that d'  ≤  d, or equivalently,

[formula]

After dividing by 2 we get

[formula]

Keeping in mind that 2 = |OO1| and 4 = |OO1| + |O'2O1|, we need to show that

[formula]

Notice that

[formula]

Hence, in order to show ([\ref=eq:case1]) it is enough to show

[formula]

This last inequality reduces, after elementary manipulations, to the triangle inequality |OO'2|  ≤  |OO1| + |O'2O1|.

Therefore, we assume that the center O2 of D2 is on the boundary of D1' and that the radius of D2 is equal to 1 (as D2 can be assumed to be critical). Now it is easy to see that [formula] passes through O1 and therefore it intersects with [formula] (at the point A2) to the left of A2' and not as required. Hence [formula].

Case 2. |OO2|  ≤  |OO1|,|O1,O2|. In this case the radii of both D and D2 are equal, and therefore are equal to 1, which, in turn, is half of the distance from O to O2. Moreover, the discs D and D2 touch each other and [formula] is their common tangent at the point where they touch.

By Lemma [\ref=lemma:lDD1], [formula]. Similar to the argument in Case 1, we let D2' denote the disc of radius 2 centered at O2. Observe that O1 must be outside D'2. This, together with the fact that [formula], implies that |O1O2|  ≤  |O1O|. This is equivalent to saying that O1 and O2 lie in the same half-plane bounded by [formula].

Let O1' be the intersection point of the line through O and O1 with the boundary of D2'. Let D'1 be the unit disc centered at O'1.

The distance from O to [formula] is greater than or equal to the distance from O to [formula].

Proof. Let x denote [formula] and let [formula]. We will now express the distance from O to [formula] as a function of x. By Observation [\ref=observation:ell], the distance from O to [formula] is equal to [formula] (here r1 = |O1O2| / 2 because D1 is critical and |O1O2|  ≤  |O1O|). From the theorem of sines with respect to triangle ΔOO1O2, [formula] and [formula].

Therefore, the distance from O to [formula] is equal to [formula]. By checking the derivative of this function with respect to x one can see that this function is monotone decreasing in x. Because [formula], this shows that the distance from O to [formula] is smaller than the distance from O to [formula]. width4pt depth1pt

Hence by taking D1 = D'1 we push [formula] closer to O and therefore, by Lemma [\ref=lemma:lDD1], we increase the value of f(O,A1,A2).

Finally, observe that when D1 = D'1 the line [formula] passes through O2. Let [formula] and notice that x is monotone decreasing in [formula] while |OA2| is monotone increasing in [formula] (see Figure [\ref=fig:case22]).

We have

[formula]

Therefore, as [formula] increases x decreases and so [formula] decreases (as can be easily verified this is an increasing function of x). On the top of this |OA2| increases and hence [formula] decreases.

Notice that [formula] is minimum when D,D2 and D1 (which is now equal to D'1) are three pairwise touching unit discs. In the latter case we have [formula], showing that indeed [formula] in general.

Case 3. |O1O2|  ≤  |OO1|,|OO2|. In this case the radii of both D1 and D2 are equal and D1 and D2 touch each other. Denote by r the radii of D1 and D2. Notice that r  ≤  1. This is because D is critical and therefore either |OO1| = 2, or |OO2| = 2 and in either case we have 2r  ≤  2. Because of the assumption in Theorem [\ref=theorem:main] both |OO1| and |OO2| are greater than or equal to twice the radius of D, namely 2. We split into two sub-cases according to which of |OO1| and |OO2| is equal to 2.

Subcase a. |OO1| = 2 and |OO2|  ≥  2. We claim that we may assume that |OO2| = 2. To see this we rotate the disc D2 around the center O1 of D1 in the clockwise direction until |OO2| = 2 and we keep track of f(O,A1,A2). Notice that by rotating the disc D2 around O1 we only change the position of A2 while O and A1 remain fixed.

Let α denote the angle [formula] and notice that as we rotate D2 clockwise around O1 until |O2O| = 2 α increases.

We have |O1O2| = 2r, |OO1| = 2 and it is not hard to see that [formula]. Notice that |OO2| is a monotone decreasing function of α.

By Observation [\ref=observation:ell], the distance from O to [formula] is equal to [formula]. The distance from O to [formula] is equal to [formula]. Let x denote the angle [formula]. We have [formula]. Let B denote the intersection point of [formula] and the line OO2 (see Figure [\ref=fig:case3a]).

Recall that |OB|, the distance from O to [formula] is equal to [formula]. We have [formula].

Hence

[formula]

From here we conclude that

[formula]

It will therefore be enough to show that the right hand side of ([\ref=eq:case3a]) decreases as we increase α. Keeping in mind that [formula] and

[formula]

The right hand side of ([\ref=eq:case3a]) becomes

[formula]

which is evidently a decreasing function of α.

We conclude that we may assume in Subcase a of Case 3 that |OO1| = |OO2| = 2. Let α denote the angle [formula]. Notice that α is a monotone increasing function of r the radii of both D1 and D2. We will show that f(O,A1,A2) is an increasing function of α. From this it will follow that one can assume that r is maximum possible, namely r = 1, but in this case [formula], as can be easily seen.

Notice that r = 2 sin α and therefore [formula].

We have

[formula]

It remains to show that this is an increasing function of α. Considering the derivative of this function, it is equivalent to showing that

[formula]

As [formula] for every [formula], it is enough to show that

[formula]

The reduces, after elementary manipulations, to

[formula]

This clearly holds for every [formula] (which we assume) because for those α we have cos 2α  ≥   sin α and therefore the left hand side of ([\ref=eq:cos2]) is at least cos 2α  +   sin 2α, that is, at least 1.

Subcase b. |OO2| = 2 and |OO1|  ≥  2. We claim that we may assume in this case that r1 = r2 = 1. This will imply |O1O2| = |OO2|  ≤  |OO1| and we may thus reduce to Case 2. To see that we may assume r1 = r2 = 1, we will increase the value of r keeping the angle [formula], that we denote by β, fixed. Through this increment we will keep D1 and D2 touching each other. At every moment denote by α the angle [formula] and notice that α is a monotone increasing function of r. We will show that as α increases the value of f(O,A1,A2) increases.

Let B denote the intersection point of [formula] with the line OO2. As |OO2| = 2, it follows from Observation [\ref=observation:ell] that [formula]. By considering the triangle ΔOO2O1 and using the theorem of sines, we see that [formula]. Therefore, again by Observation [\ref=observation:ell], we have [formula]. Recall that A2 is the intersection point of [formula] and [formula]. Denote by x the angle [formula] and notice that [formula] (see Figure [\ref=fig:case3b]).

By considering triangle ΔOA2A1, we see that

[formula]

By considering the triangle ΔOA2B, we see that

[formula]

From ([\ref=eq:111]) and ([\ref=eq:222]) it follows that

[formula]

This implies

[formula]

This means that the angle x remains fixed through the increment of the value of r and therefore, in order to show that the value of f(O,A1,A2) increases it is enough to show that |OA1| decreases, because [formula]. To see that the value of |OA1| decreases as we increase α, we recall that [formula] and therefore it is enough to show that (r + 1) sin (α  +  β) increases as we increase α. To this end consider triangle ΔO1OO2 and use the theorem of sines to see that [formula]. This implies [formula]. Using this, we see that

[formula]

Now, it is enough to observe that [formula]. This is because [formula].
