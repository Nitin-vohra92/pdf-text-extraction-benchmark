Translation surfaces of linear Weingarten type

Introduction and results.

A Weingarten surface in Euclidean space [formula] is a surface S whose mean curvature H and Gauss curvature K satisfies a non-trivial relation Ψ(H,K) = 0. This type of surfaces were introduced by the very Weingarten in the context of the problem of finding all surfaces isometric to a given surface of revolution and have been extensively studied in the literature [\cite=we]. In order to simplify the study of Weingarten surfaces, it is natural to impose some added geometric condition on the surface, as for example, that S is ruled or rotational [\cite=be] [\cite=dk] [\cite=di] [\cite=ku] [\cite=rs].

Following this strategy, Dillen, Goemans and Van de Woestyne considered Weingarten surfaces that are graphs of type z = f(x) + g(y), where f and g are smooth functions defined in some intervals [formula], respectively [\cite=dgv]. A surface S in [formula] is called a translation surface if it can locally parametrize as X(x,y) = (x,y,f(x) + g(y)). In particular, a translation surface S has the property that the translations of a parametric curve x = ct by the parametric curves y = ct remain in S (similarly for the parametric curves x = ct). In the cited paper, the authors classify all translation surfaces of Weingarten type:

The proof given in [\cite=dgv] (see also [\cite=go]) discusses many cases and it involves the solvability of a large number of ODE systems. In fact, in [\cite=dgv] it is described the procedure and it requires of calculations which are done with a computer program (as Maple) to manipulate the algebraic operations. This is the reason that some authors previously obtained partial results assuming simpler functions f and g, as for example, that they are polynomial in its variables, simplifying and doing easier the computations ([\cite=mn] [\cite=wo]).

In this paper we provide a significantly simpler proof of Th. [\ref=tdgv] when the Weingarten relation is linear in its variables. A linear Weingarten surface in Euclidean space [formula] is a surface where there exists a relation

[formula]

for some real numbers a,b,c, not all zero. In the class of linear Weingarten surfaces, we mention two families of surfaces that correspond with trivial choices of the constants a and b: surfaces with constant Gauss curvature (a = 0) and surfaces with constant mean curvature (b = 0). In Th. [\ref=tdgv], only the three first surfaces are linear Weingarten surfaces, which have constant H or constant K: a plane (H = K = 0), a generalized cylinder (K = 0) and the Scherk's minimal surface parametrized as z =  log ( cos (λy)) -  log ( cos (λx)), λ > 0 (H = 0). Besides these two families of surfaces, the classification of linear Weingarten surfaces in the general case is almost completely open today. See [\cite=gmm] [\cite=lo1] [\cite=rs].

The result that we prove is:

A translation surface in Euclidean space [formula] of linear Weingarten type is a surface with constant Gauss curvature K or constant mean curvature H. In particular, the surface is congruent with a plane, a generalized cylinder or a Scherk's minimal surface.

This proves that in the family of translation surfaces, there doesn't exist new linear Weingarten surfaces besides the trivial choices of a,b in [\eqref=w1]. We point out that an early work of Liu proved that the only translations surfaces with constant K or constant H are the three first surfaces of Th. [\ref=t1] ([\cite=li]). Finally, and with minor modifications, we extend in Th. [\ref=t2] our results to the Lorentzian ambient space (see also [\cite=dgv]).

Proof of Theorem [\ref=t1]

The mean curvature H and the Gauss curvature K are expressed in a local parametrization X as

[formula]

where {E,F,G} and {e,f,g} are the coefficients of the first fundamental form and the second fundamental form, respectively. Assume that S is a translation surface expressed locally as X(x,y) = (x,y,f(x) + g(y)) for some smooth functions f and g. Then H and K are

[formula]

Suppose now that S is also a linear Weingarten surface, where H and K satisfy the linear relation [\eqref=w1]. The proof of Theorem [\ref=t1] is by contradiction and we suppose that [formula]. Let us observe that this implies [formula] and [formula] because on the contrary, and from [\eqref=hk2], H is constant. Let

[formula]

We distinguish two cases according the value of c.

Case c = 0.

Suppose c = 0 in [\eqref=w1]. With the change a  →  2a and by using [\eqref=hk2], Equation [\eqref=w1] writes as

[formula]

We multiply [\eqref=c0] by W2 and divide by (1 + g'2)(1 + f'2) obtaining

[formula]

Introduce the next notation:

[formula]

In particular, since [formula] and [formula], then [formula] and [formula]. Then [\eqref=c1] writes as

[formula]

Let us observe that this identity implies [formula], since on the contrary, b = 0. From [\eqref=c2], we have

[formula]

We differentiate this equation with respect to x and next, with respect to y. Because the left hand side is a sum of a function of x and a function y, this calculation yields 0. On the other hand, the right hand side concludes

[formula]

This implies F' = G' = 0 and thus, F and G are constants. From [\eqref=c2], we deduce that W = 1 + f'2 + g'2 is constant, in particular, f' and g' are constant: a contradiction with the fact that [formula].

Case [formula].

Consider [formula] in [\eqref=w1]. Dividing by c, and after a change of notation, the relation [\eqref=w1] writes as

[formula]

or equivalently

[formula]

where F and G are given in [\eqref=efg]. We differentiate [\eqref=nc2] separately with respect to x and with respect to y:

[formula]

[formula]

Dividing the first equation by f'f'' and the second one by g'g'', we have

[formula]

From [\eqref=nc2], we replace the value of W2 in the above expression, obtaining

[formula]

Now we write [\eqref=nc0] as

[formula]

and we differentiate this expression with respect to x and with respect to y:

[formula]

[formula]

From both equations, we obtain the value of W on the right hand sides and we equal both expressions, deducing

[formula]

If we write [\eqref=nc3] and [\eqref=nc5] as [formula] and [formula], respectively, we obtain P1Q2 - P2Q1 = 0. After some manipulations, this identity writes as

[formula]

that is, P2Q2 = 0. We discuss by cases:

Case P2 = 0 and [formula]. Then [\eqref=nc5] implies a = 0, a contradiction.

Case [formula] and Q2 = 0 Then [\eqref=nc5] implies b = 0, a contradiction.

Case P2 = Q2 = 0. These two equations write as

[formula]

[formula]

Equation [\eqref=nc61] implies the existence of [formula] such that

[formula]

and thus

[formula]

Substituting the above in [\eqref=nc62], we get

[formula]

or

[formula]

If λ  ≠  0, differentiating this equation with respect to x and then with respect to y, we deduce

[formula]

As we suppose that f'',g''  ≠  0, we conclude that

[formula]

for some constant [formula]. Substituting in [\eqref=nc7] we deduce that f'',g'' are both constant functions, so [\eqref=nc7] yields to λ being zero, a contradiction.

Therefore, λ = 0 in [\eqref=nc7]. Equation [\eqref=nc8] says now that f'' = g'' = m, for some real number m  ≠  0. Then [\eqref=nc0] writes as

[formula]

Differentiating with respect to x and simplifying by f'f'', we get

[formula]

which implies that W is constant and this would say that f'' = g'' = 0, a contradiction.

The Lorentzian case

We consider the Lorentz-Minkowski space [formula], that is, the real vector space [formula] endowed with the metric (dx)2 + (dy)2 - (dz)2 where (x,y,z) are the canonical coordinates. A surface S immersed in [formula] is said non degenerate if the induced metric on S is non degenerated. The induced metric on S can only be of two types: positive definite and the surface is called spacelike, or a Lorentzian metric, and the surface is called timelike. For both types of surfaces, it is defined the mean curvature H and the Gauss curvature K and we say again that the surface is of linear Weingarten type if there exists a linear relation between H and K as in [\eqref=w1].

Similarly, in Lorentzian setting we can extend the concept of translation surface. A surface S in [formula] is again locally a graph on one of the coordinate planes, since this property is not metric but because S is immersed. Thus a translation surface in [formula] is a surface that writes locally as the graph of a function which is the sum of two real functions. However, in [formula] we can say a bit more. If S is spacelike, then S is a graph on the xy-plane and if S is a timelike surface, then S is a graph on the xz-plane or on the yz-plane [\cite=wei]. Therefore, if S is a translation surface in [formula], we may suppose that:

If S is spacelike, then S writes locally as z = f(x) + g(y).

If S is timelike, then S writes locally as y = f(x) + g(z) or as x = f(y) + g(z).

In [\cite=dgv], Theorem [\ref=tdgv] was extended to non-degenerate surfaces of [formula], obtaining a similar result. Again, in this classification, the only translation surfaces of linear Weingarten type appear with trivial choices of a and b and the surfaces have constant H or constant K. Similarly, we extend Theorem [\ref=t1] as follows:

A translation non-degenerate surface in Lorentz-Minkowski space [formula] of linear Weingarten type is a surface with constant Gauss curvature K or constant mean curvature H.

Translations surfaces in [formula] with constant mean curvature or constant Gauss curvature were classified in [\cite=li] and they are a plane, a Scherk's minimal surface or a generalized cylinder.

The proof of Th. [\ref=t2] is similar as Th. [\ref=t1] and we only sketch the differences. Moreover, we will carry jointly the cases that the surface S is spacelike or timelike. Again, we suppose by contradiction that [formula] in [\eqref=w1]. The expressions of H and K in local coordinates are

[formula]

where ε =  - 1 is S is spacelike and ε = 1 if S is timelike ([\cite=lo2] [\cite=wei]).

Suppose that S writes as z = f(x) + g(y) if S is spacelike or y = f(x) + g(z) if S is timelike. Then

[formula]

with W = 1 + εf'2 - g'2 > 0. Let

[formula]

If c = 0 in [\eqref=w1], then [\eqref=c2] is the same, obtaining [\eqref=eab]. This implies that W is constant, a contradiction.

If [formula], then we assume after a change of constants a and b that c = 1. Now the linear Weingarten condition [\eqref=w1] expresses as

[formula]

Now [\eqref=nc3] and [\eqref=nc5] write, respectively, as

[formula]

[formula]

We deduce

[formula]

and now the discussion by cases is similar as it was done in the Euclidean case, obtaining that W is constant, a contradiction.
