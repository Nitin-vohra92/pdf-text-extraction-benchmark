Arithmetic properties of partition quadruples with odd parts distinct

Introduction

Let [formula] denote the number of partition k-tuples of n where in each partition the odd parts are distinct. For k = 1, [formula] is often denoted as [formula]. It is well-known that

[formula]

is one of Ramanujan's theta functions. Here [formula] is standard q series notation. Moreover, we introduce the notation

[formula]

It is not difficult to find that the generating function of [formula] is

[formula]

In recent years, the arithmetic properties of [formula] have drawn much attention. In 2010, Hirschhorn and Sellers [\cite=hisc] studied the congruence properties of [formula]. They proved some infinite family of Ramanujan-type congruences including the following one: for integers α  ≥  0 and n  ≥  0,

[formula]

They also found some internal congruences such as

[formula]

In 2011, Radu and Sellers [\cite=radu] obtained other deep congruences for [formula] modulo 5 and 7 by using the tool of modular forms. Chen and Xia [\cite=wyc] then investigated the arithmetic properties of [formula]. They found two infinite families of congruences modulo 3 and 5, respectively.

Recently, the author [\cite=Wang] discovered many congruences modulo 7, 9 and 11 satisfied by [formula]. For example, we proved that for any integers α  ≥  1 and n  ≥  0,

[formula]

We continue our work by studying the congruence properties of [formula], the number of partition quadruples of n where the odd parts in each partition are distinct.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we will present an infinite family of Ramanujan-type congruences: for any integers α  ≥  1 and n  ≥  0,

[formula]

In Section 3, we prove various internal congruences such as

[formula]

In Section 4, we establish some congruences for [formula] modulo 2, 5 and 8. For example, let σ(m) denote the sum of all positive divisors of m. We establish the following arithmetic relation:

[formula]

An Infinite Family of Congruences Modulo 9

We need some facts about ψ(q) before presenting our results. The first one is the 3-disection of ψ(q)

[formula]

where

[formula]

The proof of this result can be found in [\cite=wyc] [\cite=hisc].

The following two lemmas are also of importance in our discussion.

Let p be a prime and α be a positive integer. Then

The first congruence relation is Lemma 1.2 in [\cite=radu]. The second congruence relation follows from the first one and the product representation of ψ(q).

(Cf. [\cite=hisc].) We have

[formula]

and

[formula]

Let us denote s = A(q3) and t = ψ(q9) for convenience in this section. Then we can rewrite Lemma [\ref=identity1] as

[formula]

[formula]

For any integer α  ≥  1, we have

[formula]

We proceed by induction on α. From ([\ref=podk]) and ([\ref=sttwo]), we have

[formula]

If we extract all the terms of the form q3k  +  2 in the expansion of (s2   -   qst   +   q2t2)4, we obtain

[formula]

Hence Dividing both sides by q2, then replacing q3 by q, we get

[formula]

Hence the result holds when α = 1.

Suppose

[formula]

Applying ([\ref=sttwo]) again, we obtain

[formula]

If we extract all the terms of the form q3k  +  1 in the expansion of (s2   -   qst   +   q2t2)8, we obtain Hence

[formula]

Dividing both sides by - q and then replacing q3 by q, we get

[formula]

This implies that the result holds for α + 1.

By induction on α, we complete our proof.

For any positive integer n and prime p, we denote by vp(n) the power of p in the unique prime factorization of n. Let σ(n) denote the sum of positive divisors of n.

For any integer n  ≥  0, we have

[formula]

Moreover, [formula] if and only if one of the following conditions hold. (1) There exists a prime [formula] such that [formula] . (2) There exists a prime [formula] such that [formula] .

Let α = 1 in Theorem [\ref=pod4mod9alpha]. By Lemma [\ref=basic], we have

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

From Theorem 3.6.3 in [\cite=Bruce], we know t4(n) = σ(2n + 1). Hence we proved the first assertion.

We write the unique prime factorization of 2n + 1 as [formula]. Because

[formula]

we see that 3|σ(2n + 1) if and only if there exists a prime p|2n + 1 such that [formula].

If p = 3, then [formula] (mod 3). If [formula] (mod 3), then [formula] (mod 3). Hence [formula] if and only if [formula] (mod 3).

If [formula] (mod 3), then since

[formula]

we know that [formula] if and only if [formula] (mod 3), i.e., vp(2n + 1) is odd.

For any integers α  ≥  1 and n  ≥  0, we have

[formula]

By Lemma 2.3 in [\cite=Wang], we know the coefficient of q3n  +  2 in the series expansion of [formula] is divisible by 9. Together with Theorem [\ref=pod4mod9alpha], we complete our proof.

Note that for different integers α  ≥  1, the arithmetic sequence [formula] are disjoint, and they account for

[formula]

of all nonnegative integers. We get the following corollary immediately.

[formula] is divisible by 9 for at least 1 / 6 of all nonnegative integers.

Some Internal Congruences

If we let α = 1 and α = 2 in Theorem [\ref=pod4mod9alpha], respectively, we deduce that

[formula]

By more careful treatment, we can improve this congruence to the following theorem.

For any integer n  ≥  0, we have

Before we prove this theorem, we need to establish the following lemma first.

We have

[formula]

[formula]

Let us go back to the proof of Theorem [\ref=pod4mod9alpha]. By ([\ref=mod272]) and ([\ref=mod273]), if we extract all the terms of the form q3n + 2 in the expansion of ψ(q) -  4, then divide by q2 and replace q3 by q, we obtain

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=identity1], we have A(q)3ψ(q3) = ψ(q)4 - qψ(q3)4. Substituting this formula into the identity above, after simple manipulations, we proved the first identity.

Now we turn to the second congruence identity. If we extract all the terms of the form q3k  +  1 in the expansion of (s2   -   qst   +   q2t2)8, we get

By ([\ref=stpsi8]), extracting all the terms of the form q3k  +  1 in the expansion of [formula] and doing reduction modulo 81, we obtain

[formula]

If we denote by F(q) the sum of all the terms of the form q3k  +  1 in the expansion of [formula], we get

[formula]

Similarly, by ([\ref=sttwo]) we have

[formula]

If we extract all the terms of the form q3k in the expansion of (s2   -   qst   +   q2t2)12, we obtain

[formula]

Now if we denote by G(q) the sum of all the terms of the form q3k  +  1 in the expansion of [formula], we get

[formula]

In the same way, since [formula] (mod 3), by ([\ref=sttwo]) we have

[formula]

If we denote by H(q) the sum of all the terms of the form q3k  +  1 in the expansion of [formula], then [formula] (mod 81). Together with ([\ref=10term1]), ([\ref=term2]) and the first identity in this lemma, we obtain Dividing both sides by - q and replacing q3 by q, note that [formula] (mod 3), we proved the second congruence identity.

Now we are ready to prove Theorem [\ref=interpod4].

By Lemma [\ref=pod4mod27], we have

[formula]

The first congruence follows immediately.

Moreover, we have Since ψ(q) = A(q3) + qψ(q9), we know the terms of the form q3k  +  2 vanish in the right hand side of the identity above. Hence

[formula]

We proved the third congruence.

For the second congruence, we need more arguments.

By ([\ref=st12mod9]), the sum of all the terms of the form q3k in the expansion of (s2   -   qst   +   q2t2)12 is congruent to (s3    +    q3t3)8 modulo 9. If we denote by I(q) the sum of all the terms of the form q3k  +  1 in the expansion of [formula], then by ([\ref=lateruse]) we have

[formula]

By ([\ref=3k1mod81]), we know the sum of all the terms of the form q3k  +  1 in the expansion of [formula] is congruent to [formula] modulo 9. Hence if we extract all the terms of the form q3k  +  1 in both sides of ([\ref=ker]), we obtain The second congruence follows.

The modulus in Theorem [\ref=interpod4] cannot be replaced by high powers of 3. Because we have

Congruences Modulo 2, 5 and 8

We have

[formula]

[formula]

By ([\ref=podk]) we have

[formula]

From [\cite=pee] we know

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

From which the theorem follows.

For any integer n  ≥  0, we have (1) [formula] . (2) If n = k(k + 1) for some integer k, then [formula] . Otherwise [formula] .

(1) By Theorem [\ref=ramaid] and Lemma [\ref=basic] we have Note that the terms of the form q2n  +  1 do not appear in the right hand side of the above equation, we deduce that [formula] (mod 2).

(2) Again by Theorem [\ref=ramaid] and Lemma [\ref=basic], we have

[formula]

By Jacobi's identity (Cf. [\cite=Bruce]), we have

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

Comparing the coefficients of qn on both sides, we complete our proof.

Let p  ≥  3 be a prime and [formula] . Suppose r is an integer such that 8r + 1 is a quadratic non-residue modulo p, then we have

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=basic], we have

[formula]

Note that [formula], and [formula] (mod p) is equivalent to [formula] (mod p). If 8r + 1 is a quadratic non-residue modulo p, then qpn  +  r vanishes in the expansion of the right hand side. We complete our proof.

In particular, let p = 5 and m = 4. We have

For any integer n  ≥  0, we have

[formula]

We have

[formula]

where

[formula]

Since [formula], and the residue of n(n + 1) / 2 modulo 5 can only be 0, 1 or 3, we may assume that

[formula]

Because [formula] (mod 5) if and only if [formula] (mod 5), we have

[formula]

Replacing q5 by q, and replacing the index n by - n - 1 in the second summmation, accordingly the summation range of n starting form -    ∞   and ends with - 1, combining the two sums together, and applying Jacobi's triple product identity, we obtain

[formula]

Note that [formula] (mod 5) if and only if [formula] (mod 5), by a similar way we can show that B(q) = (   -   q,   -   q4,q5;q5) ∞   .

Finally, since [formula] (mod 5) if and only if [formula] (mod 5), we have

[formula]

The proof of this lemma is now complete.

For any integer n  ≥  0, we have

[formula]

Moreover, [formula] if and only if one of the following conditions are satisfied. (1) There exists prime [formula] such that [formula] ; (2) There exists prime [formula] or 4 such that [formula] .

By Lemma [\ref=basic], we have [formula] (mod 5). By Lemma [\ref=5disection], we obtain

[formula]

If we extract all the terms of the form q5n  +  3, then divide by -  q3 and replace q5 by q, apply [formula] (mod 5) again, we have

[formula]

Note that t4(n) = σ(2n + 1), comparing the coefficients of qn on both sides, we deduce that

[formula]

We write the unique prime factorization of 2n + 1 as [formula]. Then

[formula]

Let p be any prime factor of 2n + 1. If p = 5, then [formula] (mod 5).

If [formula] (mod 5), then [formula] (mod 5). Now [formula] if and only if [formula] (mod 5).

If [formula] or 4 (mod 5), then

[formula]

Hence [formula] if and only if [formula] (mod 5), which is also equivalent to [formula] (mod 4).
