Critical exponents and scaling invariance in the absence of a critical point

Introduction

Our understanding of the ferromagnetic phase transition foresees the appearance of a finite, spatially uniform spontaneous (i.e. occurring in zero applied magnetic field) magnetization as the temperature is lowered below a well-defined critical (Curie) temperature [\cite=Landau]. Strictly speaking, however, a finite three-dimensional body (i.e. a body extending over sufficiently large but finite lengths in all three spatial directions) lacks a finite uniform magnetization at any temperature [\cite=Griffiths], as a result of the dipole-dipole interaction, which, albeit weak, frustrates the tendency to ferromagnetism inherent to the exchange interaction [\cite=Arrott] [\cite=Houches]. Thus, the dipole-dipole interaction leads necessarily to a situation of "avoided critical point" [\cite=Kivelson], where the phase transition proceeds via a yet not fully elucidated and probably not universal mechanism [\cite=Kivelson] [\cite=Bra] [\cite=Abanov] [\cite=Barci_PRB_2009] [\cite=Cannas_PRB_2004] [\cite=Schmalian-Wolynes_PRL2000] [\cite=Note]. At present, both the theoretical and experimental behavior of the various thermodynamic quantities in the vicinity of such an avoided critical point are uncertain. Here we demonstrate, on one side, the validity of conventional notions like critical exponents and scaling hypothesis[\cite=Landau] in the vicinity of such an avoided critical point, implying the existence of a correlation length governing the phase transition. On the other side, we also establish that, when the putative critical point is approached, the non-analytic behavior transforms into an analytic one. Simultaneously, we observe that the paramagnetic to ferromagnetic phase transition proceeds within a background of spatially nonuniform magnetization. We show that the spatial length characterizing the modulated, nonuniform magnetization originates from the dipole-dipole interaction and that it persists below as well as above the putative critical temperature, alongside the (putative) correlation length, controlled by the hypothetical critical point.

Strategy

The paramagnetic to ferromagnetic phase transition investigated in this work occurs in ultrathin Fe films grown at room temperature by molecular-beam epitaxy onto the (001) surface of a Cu single crystal (see Ref. [\cite=Saratz_PhD_2009] for details). The system has macroscopic lengths within a plane but finite thickness perpendicular to the plane (typically between 1.6 and 2.0 atomic monolayers (ML)). It is magnetized perpendicular to the plane, so that it has the right symmetry to realize the famous Onsager critical point [\cite=OnsagerYang] of the two-dimensional (2D) Ising model. However, as shown in Ref. [\cite=Biskup], it also suffers the very same frustration foreseen for finite three-dimensional bodies so that the paramagnetic to ferromagnetic phase transition is associated with the appearance of stripes and/or bubble domains of opposite magnetization rather than with the formation of a spatially uniform spontaneous magnetization [\cite=Abanov] [\cite=Seul_Science_1995] [\cite=Allenspach_PRL_1992] [\cite=Saratz_PRL_2010] [\cite=Saratz_PRB_2010] [\cite=Qiu] [\cite=Back_Nature_13] [\cite=Cannas_PRB_2011] [\cite=Debell] [\cite=Diaz-Mendez_PRB_2010] [\cite=Pighin_PRB_2007]. Accordingly, the transition falls into the category of transitions with "avoided critical point". We have followed three strategies: On one side an experimental one, consisting in performing magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) [\cite=Moke] measurements of the macroscopic, spatially averaged magnetization as a function of temperature T and externally applied perpendicular magnetic field H. Technically speaking, MOKE measures a signal which is proportional to the average magnetization [\cite=Moke]. Here we use the character "M" to identify the measured quantity, which is accordingly given in arbitrary units. In a second step, the measurement of macroscopic thermodynamic quantities was complemented with spatially resolved magnetic imaging[\cite=Saratz_PRB_2010] aimed at measuring the evolution of the local magnetization during the phase transition, with submicrometer spatial resolution. Finally, we explore the possibility of realizing the scaling hypothesis in Monte-Carlo simulations of a 2D Ising model, with spins on a lattice and interacting via the familiar exchange interaction - which promotes ferromagnetic order - and dipolar interaction. The latter, albeit weak, is long ranged and in films magnetized perpendicular to the plane frustrates the tendency to ferromagnetism. In the presence of the dipolar interaction, it is not a priori clear whether any scaling behavior - explicit in the 2D Ising model with pure exchange interaction - is left behind, nor in which region of the (T,H) parameter space such scaling might be found.

Results

Scaling plots

Magnetization curves M(T,H) are plotted as a M(T)-family of isochamps in Fig.1 (top). The magnetic field was swept with a frequency varying between 10- 1 and 1 Hz. M(H)-curves measured at fixed temperature within this range of frequencies coincide: we assume that we are observing properties related to thermodynamic equilibrium. At higher frequencies we have detected a substantial dynamical component and the results of these studies will be reported in a separate paper. A color code, indicated along the vertical bar, is used for the values of H. The dot on the horizontal scale indicates the highest temperature T* for which static domains of modulated order are detected with our imaging instrument[\cite=mobility] (see also Appendix [\ref=App_L] for representative images). We distinguish two extreme sets of M(T)-curves. On the right-hand side those corresponding to larger values of H, taken in a state of uniform magnetization. They show the familiar behavior of M(T)-curves separating out with increasing magnetic field and are suggestive of a conventional underlying critical point becoming more and more "avoided" with increasing applied magnetic field (this is an example of trivially "avoided critical point" [\cite=Kivelson]). On the left-hand side the family of curves corresponding to low H: while the temperature is increased the average magnetization abruptly drops to almost zero as the system enters the state of static modulated order, which we observe directly up to the temperature T*. Our images, however, indicate that the magnetization within the domains is still large and therefore the vanishing of the average magnetization upon entering the modulated phase at T  ≤  T* is entirely due to the cancellation of finite opposite values of the local magnetization within the domains. We point out, however, that our distinction between "high" and "low" magnetic field curves is based on our imaging of the spatial distribution of the magnetization: the macroscopic thermodynamic quantity M(T,H) itself does not contain, at first glance, any specific information which could be used to classify the set of M(T)-curves. The scaling hypothesis [\cite=Landau] states that the equation of state M = M(T,H) can be simplified to a one variable relation [formula], provided the rescaled variables : = M / H1 / δ and : = τ / Hδβ are used, τ   =   (T - TC) / TC being the so called reduced temperature. In conventional ferromagnets TC is the critical temperature at which, e.g., the critical isochamp (order parameter) M(T,H = 0) vanishes. The critical exponent β is defined via the asymptotic behavior of the critical isochamp near TC, i.e. M(T,H = 0)  ~  ( - τ)β. The critical exponent δ is defined via the asymptotic behavior of the critical isotherm M(TC,H)  ~  H1 / δ. Notice that T* cannot be used as "TC" to define τ: at T* magnetic domains do not disappear but become mobile(see Appendix [\ref=App_L] and Ref. [\cite=mobility]), so that the magnetic contrast in our images at H = 0 fades away above T*, but the magnetization within the mobile domains is still substantial. Moreover, neither a critical isochamp nor a critical isotherm exist. However, the conventional lore of scaling (Ref. [\cite=Landau], p.485) in the critical or near critical region indicates practical ways to extrapolate values for TC, β and δ using experimental M-data originating within the high-temperature, non-zero field region of the parameter space, as discussed in Appendices [\ref=App_T_C] and [\ref=App_crit_exp]. In Fig.1 (bottom) we have used the experimentally determined values of (TC,β,δ) to plot the rescaled quantities [formula] versus [formula]. Except for a (substantial) set of data points we observe that the spread of data-points inherent to Fig.1 (top) has reduced considerably, i.e. many M(T)-isochamps have collapsed onto one "thin" graph, made of colored pieces in Fig.1 (bottom). Such a collapsing is considered to be a signature of the scaling hypothesis at a critical point, but the emphasis must be on the substantial set of noncollapsed data points.

Phase diagram

In this subsection we locate the "collapsed" and "non-collapsed" data points within the (T,H) phase diagram. For this purpose, we use a different set of scaling variables, see Fig.2 (top) (in Appendix [\ref=App_Griffiths] we report the scaling plots using a third set of variables, for completeness). Within this diagram, locations with higher density of data points can be recognized by inspection. Using an ad-hoc software, we marked the low-density points - which we consider as "non-collapsed" - in gray, while the high-density points - which we consider as "collapsed" - are left in their original color (vertical bar in Fig.1). The gray (non-collapsed) data points and the colored (collapsed) ones are subsequently transferred into their place in the (T,H)-plane, Fig.2 (bottom), where they appear inside, respectively outside a bell-shaped region marked in gray. To represent the phase diagram in Fig.2 (bottom) the variable t: = (T - T*) / T* is used. Notice that many reddish color-coded points appear in the lower left-hand section of the scaling plot Fig.2 (top). They correspond to high temperatures and low applied magnetic fields and they are scattered because of noise, resulting in a small density. Despite this, we consider them as "collapsed", because they are spread along the continuation of the scaling function of the 2D Ising model (the continuous line in Fig.2 (top). The bell-shaped region starts on the left with the boundary line marking the transition from (static) modulated-to-uniform phase, recorded by direct imaging of the spatial distribution of the magnetization. It continues beyond t = 0, i.e. beyond the range of temperature and magnetic fields where a static modulation of order is observed. Evidently, the static magnetic domains [\cite=Saratz_PRL_2010] represent only a small portion of the ferromagnetic transition.

The "gray zone"

The content of the "gray" region for t > 0 is largely unknown, and here we offer some facts. First, the static stripes observed for t < 0 (see Appendix [\ref=App_L]) continue to exist, just above t = 0, but, as already shown in Ref. [\cite=mobility], acquire a mobility. Second, of course, within the "gray zone" the singular behavior reported in the previous subsection is lost. In particular, the M versus H dependence for low magnetic fields is perfectly linear within the "gray" zone, i.e. at sufficiently low magnetic fields, a singular behavior, characterized by some non-linear M versus H relationship, does not develop. It appears, therefore, that non-analytic behavior is precisely suppressed when the putative critical point is approached! Third - the content of Fig.3 - the long spatial scale, established by the dipole-dipole interaction as period of modulation for t   <   0 (see also Fig. 11 in Appendix), is shown here to persist well above t   =   0. Figure 3 shows this characteristic length scale L as a function of temperature, in the vicinity of t = 0. Two sets of data points (blue triangles and pink squares) are obtained from images of the spatial distribution of the magnetization (upon cooling and upon heating), see Appendix [\ref=App_L]. Only the region t   <   0 is covered by imaging, as there the pattern is static. The different values upon cooling and heating well below t = 0 originate from a dynamical component of stripe formation explained in Ref. [\cite=Saratz_PRB_2010]. Close to t = 0 the two curves merge. In this region we have also determined, on the same sample, the period of modulation using the slope of the low-field portion of the M versus H-curves (red and green crosses) ( Appendix [\ref=App_L]). The periods of modulation determined with the two complementary methods agree well in the range where both methods can be used. In addition, L(t) deduced from M versus H can be continued to t   >   0 (colored crosses in Fig. 3), suggesting that the characteristic length, originating below t = 0 from the stripe width of a static domain pattern, evolves smoothly well into the t   >   0 section of the "gray zone" (and even beyond, see the inset of Fig.3). Fig.3 thus establishes a characteristic "long" spatial scale at any temperature, carrying neither a sign of the transition to mobile stripes (at T*) nor a sign of the avoided critical point at TC and extending from few 10 nm to several μm (and more, not shown here).

Monte-Carlo simulations

We consider the Hamiltonian [\cite=Pighin_PRB_2007]

[formula]

where the spins Si  =    ±  1 are defined on a square lattice with N  =  Lx  ×  Ly sites and periodic boundary conditions (Ewald sums technique was used to handle them). The first term in Eq. [\eqref=Hamilton1] represents the short-range exchange interaction (the sum runs over all pairs of nearest-neighboring sites). The second term represents the long-range dipolar interaction in the Ising limit, the corresponding sum running over all pairs of distinct sites on the lattice. The third term represents the Zeeman energy. The Hamiltonian in Eq. [\eqref=Hamilton1] is far from describing ultrathin Fe films on Cu(100) in detail. However, it is considered to build a model Hamiltonian capturing realistically competing interactions and the avoided critical point. Accordingly, it has been found to display a variety of modulated phases [\cite=Debell] [\cite=Diaz-Mendez_PRB_2010] [\cite=Pighin_PRB_2007] [\cite=Cannas_PRB_2006] within some region of the (T,h) parameter space, even for those moderate values of the ratio J / g where Monte-Carlo simulations are practicable [\cite=footnote1]. In this particular study we have explored the phase diagram outside this region, with the aim of searching for some residual scaling behaviour. In a first step we have determined a limiting field hc above which the system is in a spatially uniform state, within the temperature range considered by the simulation. hc was determined from the behavior of the average spin polarization [formula] as a function of temperature for fixed values of h, according to a zero-field-cooled-field-cooled (ZFC-FC) protocol [\cite=footnote2]. In a second step we have computed isochamps during the heating part of the ZFC-FC cycle, shown on the top of Fig.4 for J / g = 10 and hc / g = 0.32  ±  0.02. The spreading of the isochamps with different values of the magnetic field is similar to the experimental one reported in the top of Fig.1. In a third step we attempted scaling plots, trying to bring the isochamps to collapse onto one single curve. It turned out that collapsing could be indeed realized for h > hc (colored in the bottom of Fig.4) and a significant departure from collapsing was observed for h < hc (gray points corresponding to h / g = 0.2), i.e. inside the region of the phase diagram where nonuniform magnetization appears. For building the scaling plots of Fig.4 we used the known 2D Ising critical exponents, but the value for the putative critical temperature TC, required to build the reduced temperature τ, cannot be read out in an obvious way from the set of isochamps of Fig.4. We found, for a practicable set of J / g values, that the best data collapse could be realized assuming a transition temperature given in the inset of Fig.4 (bottom) as a function of J / g. Remarkable about this temperature is that it can be expressed as the transition temperature for the "pure" 2D Ising model subtracted by a value which corresponds to about 11.2  g (see Inset of Fig.4 (bottom)). We recall that, within a simple mean-field approach, the presence of the dipolar interaction in a uniformly magnetized state reduces the transition temperature by an amount corresponding to about 4πg! The picture emerging from Fig.4 is in line with the experimental outcome and underlines the realization of scaling and power laws in a situation where the critical point is avoided.

Discussion

The familiar description of a second-order phase transition foresees that at sufficiently large temperatures T the free-energy density F(M) in the variable M (average magnetization) has a minimum at M   =   0 (Fig.5, top). When the temperature is lowered below a critical value TC, the graph of F(M) acquires a flat portion (Fig.5, top) between two limiting values ±  M0(T) defining a situation of spontaneously broken symmetry with spatially uniform magnetization ±  M0(T). The present paper is in contrast to this picture because it finds that the flat portion is replaced by a minimum of F(M) at M   =   0 for any temperature (Fig.5, bottom). Notice that we are not the first to point out the difficulty of translating the familiar description of second-order phase transitions [\cite=Landau] to the paramagnetic-to-ferromagnetic transition [\cite=Griffiths] [\cite=Arrott]. But the present results pinpoint some essential elements of the "gray zone" replacing the critical point which were not recognized explicitly yet: i) the recovery of the familiar properties of scaling and power laws, albeit outside the gray zone, ii) the existence of static as well as mobile regions of spatially modulated order (i.e. magnetic domains) and iii) the persistence below as well as above the putative critical temperature of a dipolar-induced characteristic spatial scale of modulation (i.e. domain size) which evolves smoothly with temperature. It is important to mention at this point the vast literature  [\cite=Poki] [\cite=Amn] describing the cross-over from the exchange controlled criticality to the dipolar-controlled criticality within a very narrow temperature range in the vicinity of the critical point. Notice that the cross-over considered in this literature preserves the critical point (albeit with slightly modified critical exponents), in contrast to our observations. However, the cross-over scenario refers to a situation of uniform spontaneous magnetization which is actually forbidden for finite three-dimensional bodies. We can, in principle, envisage special situations where a uniform magnetization is possible, such as the infinite-volume limit underlying the cross-over scenarios [\cite=Poki] [\cite=Amn], but also an inefficient domain nucleation that keeps the body in a metastable state of uniform magnetization, or some very particular shapes (not covered by Ref. [\cite=Griffiths]) which energetically penalize the formation of domains. However, the true absence of any domain, both below as well as above the putative critical point, must be verified specifically[\cite=AA1], as these situations must be regarded as exceptional while the rule is rather a "gray zone", i.e. an avoided critical point. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to establish, on the base of experimental and theoretical data related to macroscopic thermodynamic quantities alone, the extent of the gray zone [\cite=AA2]. In summary, the recovering of the scaling hypothesis outside the "gray region" means, on one side, that scaling properties and critical exponents, referring to macroscopic thermodynamic quantities, are not necessarily a proof of the existence of a critical point. On the other side, their emergence in a situation of avoided criticality, where the phase transition actually might even be a purely dynamical one [\cite=Note], sets some well-defined boundaries on future realistic models of the ferromagnetic phase transition (and of second-order phase transitions in general). These models will have to take into account the presence of (at least) two mesoscopic spatial scales: the correlation length, whose divergence at the putative critical point is an essential ingredient for the current understanding of critical phenomena, and the dipolar-induced characteristic period of modulation, observed in our experiments.

Experimental determination of TC

One useful property of a conventional second-order phase transition is that the plot of the magnetic susceptibility χ(T,H) = ∂M(T,H) / ∂H as a function of the temperature has a maximum at a temperature Tmax(H) that approaches TC as H approaches zero [\cite=Change-Lee]. Figure 6 (top) shows the susceptibility χ(T,H) of the "pure" (i.e. without dipolar interactions) 2D Ising model computed by means of Monte-Carlo simulations. For any [formula] the maximum value of χ(T,H) is finite but - as expected - it is higher the weaker the fields are. Notice that the true approach of Tmax(H) to TC may not necessarily be linear in H, as pointed out in Ref. [\cite=Change-Lee], but our numerical simulations (bottom of Fig.6) show that a linear extrapolation of Tmax toward H = 0 gives a fairly accurate estimate of TC. From the experimental data we obtained the χ(T,H) by first treating the raw M(T,H) data with a Savitzky-Golay finite-impulse-response smoothing filter implemented in MATLAB. After filtering, the derivative χ(T,H) = ∂M(T,H) / ∂H could readily be obtained. In Fig.7 (top) some of the resulting susceptibility curves are shown for selected values of H. The experimental H(Tmax) is plotted at the bottom of Fig.7. This graph, in contrast to the one of the "pure" 2D Ising model, shows two distinct regimes, depending on the range of H. We discuss first the low temperature regime. When cooling in weak enough fields, the system first enters the "gray zone", (see the phase diagram in Fig.2 of the main document), without displaying any anomaly in the susceptibility in correspondence of this transition. Upon further cooling a re-entrant transition from the patterned to the uniform phase is encountered [\cite=Saratz_PRL_2010] [\cite=Saratz_PRB_2010] [\cite=port]: this second transition is accompanied by a sharp maximum in the susceptibility (abrupt increase of the magnetization). This type of maxima - highlighted by a blue dashed line in Fig.7 (bottom) - when extrapolated to H = 0 leads to a temperature at which the sample consists of very large stripes carrying opposite but almost saturated values of the magnetization [\cite=Saratz_PRL_2010] [\cite=Saratz_PRB_2010] [\cite=port]. Above this temperature, the sample keeps the modulated order up T*, where domains become mobile but the magnetization within them is still substantial. Accordingly, TC must be above T*. On the other side, for larger fields (the right-hand side portion of the graph) the "gray zone" is never entered and the system is in a uniform state: H(Tmax) for larger H was therefore taken to extrapolate towards a putative TC. Several linear fittings were performed by choosing different ranges of the field μ0  ·  H between 30  ·  10- 4T and 80  ·  10- 4 T. The different fittings produced the family of red lines (bottom of Fig.7) from which the error on the TC was estimated. The experimental TC, for this particular sample, is 300  ±  1 K. Notice that the extrapolated TC lies within the cross-over range (K) [formula], in which the "blue-line" types of maxima transform into the "red-line" types of maxima.

Experimental determination of β and δ

The critical exponent β can be deduced from the experimentally determined values of the exponents γ and δ, using the relation β  δ   =   β   +   γ. The exponent γ determines the magnetization in the region of weak fields (Eq. 148.8. in Ref. [\cite=Landau]) according to

[formula]

The exponent δ determines the magnetization in the region of strong fields according to the relation

[formula]

(see Eq. 148.10 in Ref. [\cite=Landau]). The notion of "weak" and "strong" field is, of course, dependent on which temperature interval is addressed. In Fig.8 we plot log (M / H) versus log |τ| for different values of H, with the color code indicating the values of H (see horizontal scale in the inset). At sufficiently high temperatures, a region of the graph emerges where all curves for different magnetic fields almost collapse onto one single straight line, and thus fulfill the scaling properties required by Eq. (1) for the quantity M / H. The negative of the slope of the resulting straight line is the sought-for exponent γ. Several linear fittings were performed for fixed fields ranging from 20  ·  10- 4 T to 80  ·  10- 4 T; these independent determinations of γ are shown in the inset. After averaging, for TC = 300 K we obtain γ = 1.78  ±  0.09, with the error given by the standard deviation of the mean. As consistency check, the whole procedure was repeated varying the value of TC. The standard deviation of the mean values of γ goes through a minimum in the range (K) 298   ≤   TC   ≤   301, which is, accordingly, the range where the "best collapsing" of the M / H-curves is realized. When TC is varied in this interval, γ ranges from 1.7 to 1.9. The log (M / H) versus log H plot of Fig.9 in the temperature range (K) 299   <   T   <   301, reveals a low-field region where the curves saturate to an almost constant vale, indicating the linearity of M versus H for weak fields. In the strong-field region the graphs are observed to almost collapse onto a single straight line, the slope of which amounts to (1 - δ) / δ, consistently with Eq. 2. From these slopes fitted for different T in the appropriate regime of Fig.9 we estimate δ  =  13  ±  2.

Griffiths-Widom representation of the equation of state

The Griffiths representation of the equation of state reads [\cite=Griffiths-Widom]:

[formula]

with x = τ / M1 / β. In Fig.10 the same data points shown in Fig. 2 (top) of the main document are plotted in this representation with the same color coding. Particularly clear is how gray points deviate from scaling for the data plotted in the inset (- 2  ·  1016  ≤  x  ≤  1017). In the main frame the non-collapsed, gray points decorate the colored line of clearly collapsed points up to x  ~  1023. For larger values of x, the main line broadens as well: these are the high temperature, low-field "noisy" data points already discussed in the bulk of the paper. In this representation data collapsing is realized over forty orders of magnitude with respect to the x-variable and eighty orders of magnitude with respect to the variable H / Mδ. The theoretical scaling function h(x) given in Ref. [\cite=Gaunt_JPhysC_1970] for the unfrustrated 2D Ising model is plotted as a green dashed line. Colored, collapsed points follow this curve very well up to [formula] (note the remarkable agreement in the inset).

Experimental determination of the stripe width L

In the temperature region t   <   0 stripe domains are static and can be imaged by our instrument. The set of images used e.g. to extract the "pink" data point of Fig.4 is given in Fig.11. The "black" and "white" regions correspond to domains of opposite perpendicular magnetization. While the images are taken (the images are built by line scans from top to bottom, starting from the left hand side of the image), the temperature is lowered. The limiting temperatures are always indicated at the left (right) of the image, the temperature in between is interpolated linearly. At some temperature (which is called t = 0 in this paper and is indicated, in absolute units, by the red vertical line in (a)), thin stripes become static and, from now on, their width can be determined by inspection. The data poins reported in Fig.4 refer to the black vertical lines indicated in the images. At the lowest temperatures some asymmetry in the width of black and white regions appear, as expected because of residual magnetic fields [\cite=Saratz_PhD_2009]. The stripe width can also be determined, in absolute units, using the slope of the measured M versus H curve for very low magnetic fields, where the M varies linearly with H. In the range of linear response, we find [\cite=Note] that the dipolar interaction establishes a characteristic stripe width (or "modulation length") L, obeying the following equation:

[formula]

(d being the thickness of the film). M(T,H) is the average magnetization, which must enter this equation in the absolute units =   Tesla. Experimentally, we can determine only M(T,H), so that, in order to use this equation, we proceed as follows. We find [formula] as the value of the MOKE signal at low temperatures and sufficiently large magnetic fields, so that the spins are almost fully ferromagnetically aligned. We then assume that the MOKE signal is proportional to M to write M(T,H) = MS  M(T,H) / MS. Inserted in Eq. [\eqref=Eq_L] leads to an expression of L in terms of the measured ratio M(T,H) / MS and the known parameters d (in the present case 3.6  ·  10- 4 μm) and MS (the saturation magnetization of bulk Fe, μ0MS  ≈  2T). We point out that the absolute values obtained in this way compare favorably, in the range where imaging is possible, with the absolute values determined with imaging, see Fig.4 of the main document. This correspondence also establishes unambiguously the dipolar origin of the modulation length L.
