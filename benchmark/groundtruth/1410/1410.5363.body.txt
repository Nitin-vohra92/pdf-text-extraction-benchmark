CLOSE STELLAR BINARY SYSTEMS BY GRAZING ENVELOPE EVOLUTION

INTRODUCTION

It is commonly accepted that close binary systems where at least one of the stars is a stellar remnant, mainly a white dwarf (WD) or a neutron star (NS), have evolved through a common envelope (CE) phase (e.g., [\citealt=Paczynski1976] [\citealt=vandenHeuvel1976] [\citealt=IbenLivio1993] [\citealt=TaamSandquist2000] [\citealt=Podsiadlowski2001] [\citealt=Webbink2008] [\citealt=TaamRicker2010] [\citealt=RickerTaam2012] [\citealt=Ivanovaetal2013]). There are some major open questions with regards to the CE evolution. One of these is the duration of the final CE phase, months (e.g., [\citealt=SandquistTaam1998] [\citealt=DeMarco2003] [\citealt=DeMarco2009] [\citealt=Passy2011] [\citealt=RickerTaam2012]), or maybe only days to several weeks (e.g., [\citealt=RasioLivio1996]; [\citealt=LivioSoker1988]). Another open question involves the process that determines the final core-secondary orbital separation.

The most common practice to calculate the final orbital separation of the CE phase is to equate the gravitational energy released by the spiraling-in binary system, EG, to the envelope binding energy, Ebind, with an efficiency of αCE: αCEEG  =  Ebind (e.g., [\citealt=Webbink1984] [\citealt=TaurisDewi2004] [\citealt=Ivanovaetal2013]; see [\citealt=NelemansTout2005] for an alternative). Many researchers add the envelope internal energy in the energy-balance equation of this αCE-prescription (e.g. [\citealt=Han1994] [\citealt=Zorotovic2010] [\citealt=XuLi2010] [\citealt=Davis2011] [\citealt=Rebassa-Mansergas2012] [\citealt=IvanovaChaichenets2011]). Numerical studies of the CE process have made a progress over the years (e.g., [\citealt=SandquistTaam1998] [\citealt=Lombardi2006] [\citealt=DeMarco2011] [\citealt=Passy2011] [\citealt=Passyetal2012a] [\citealt=RickerTaam2012]), e.g., the αCE = 0.25 found in the study of [\cite=RickerTaam2012] agrees with the value derived from observations of close binary systems as presented by [\cite=NordhausSpiegel2013]. Still, better numerical resolutions and more computer resources for longer runs are required to show that the CE process can indeed leads to the observed systems.

In light of some difficulties in the αCE  -  prescription (e.g., [\citealt=Soker2013]) it has been suggested that in many cases jets launched by the more compact companion can facilitate envelope ejection, and that the final spiraling-in process is by migration, i.e., interaction of the binary system with a circumbinary thick disk or a flattened envelope [\citep=Soker2004] [\citep=KashiSoker2011] [\citep=Soker2013] [\citep=Soker2014]. CE ejection by jets launched from a NS companion were studied by [\cite=ArmitageLivio2000] and [\cite=Chevalier2012], but not as a general CE ejection process. The present approach is that the launching of jets by the companion is a generic CE ejection process (although not in all CE cases).

Here I raise the following question: Can it be that jets launched by the secondary star will prevent the formation of a CE phase altogether as the secondary star spirals-in toward the core of the giant star? The necessary ingredients for such a grazing envelope evolution (GEE) are discussed in section [\ref=sec:GE]. I suggest there a new type of spiraling-in process where the more compact companion grazes the envelope of a giant star, and ejects the outer envelope layers as it circles the giant and spirals-in. At the heart of this process are jets, or disk winds, that are launched by the secondary star. Energy considerations are discussed in section [\ref=sec:Energy], two specific examples are discussed in section [\ref=sec:examples], and a short summary is in section [\ref=sec:summary].

INGREDIENTS OF THE GRAZING ENVELOPE EVOLUTION (GEE)

There are two basic mechanisms that lead to the formation a CE phase of a giant and a more compact secondary star. (1) The giant transfers mass to the secondary at a rate that the secondary cannot accommodate. The secondary inflates a large envelope that merges with the giant envelope. (2) The giant expands and/or the companion spirals-in and the giant engulfs the secondary star. This mechanism is efficient when the secondary is far from bringing the giant envelope to synchronization with the orbital motion.

To have a GEE both these processes must be of small to moderate size, as discussed below. It is important to keep in mind that the GEE is different from a regular mass transfer in binary systems in that in the GEE the system evolves in a constant state of 'just entering a CE phase'. Namely, parts of the giant envelope overflow the Roche lobe in a large volume around the first Lagrangian point L1, but jets (or disk wind) launched by the secondary star prevent the formation of a CE. If it hadn't been for these jets, the system would have entered a CE phase. Another point of the GEE is that if it was not for the jets that are lunched by the secondary star, the system would have enter a CE phase. Namely, if a system is not to enter a CE phase by the CE theory, it would also not enter a GEE. Such an example is the Red Rectangle that is discussed in section [\ref=sec:examples].

High accretion rate

To prevent a CE phase during most, or all, of the evolution, the companion must be able to accrete at a very high rate, [formula], without inflating a large envelope. This implies that energy must be removed efficiently from the accreted gas. For an accreting NS neutrino cooling allows a mass accretion rate of [formula] [\citep=Chevalier2012]. For a WD it seems that such a high accretion rate is not possible, as nuclear burning will commence and inflate an envelope.

To prevent large expansion of main sequence (MS) stars the internal energy per unit mass of the accreted mass must be lower than half the magnitude of the specific gravitational energy on the stellar surface [formula]. The inner boundary of an accretion disk that touches the accreting star meets this condition as the specific kinetic energy is ekin  =  0.5 ~ eG. If there is a boundary layer where the disk gas sharply spins-down to the stellar rotation, then energy removal from the boundary layer can lead to eacc < 0.5 ~ eG, and more important, can lower the entropy and further prevent much envelope expansion (e.g., [\citealt=HjellmingTaam1991]).

The way to remove the excess energy is by jets (or a collimated wind) from an accretion disk, as has been suggested for the 1837-1856 Great Eruption of η Carinae [\citep=KashiSoker2010]. In the process, most of the energy in the disk is transferred to magnetic fields that by violent reconnection eject mass. Namely, the released gravitational accretion energy is channelled to magnetic fields and outflows much more than to thermal energy and radiation (Shiber, S., Schreier, R., & Soker, N., 2015, in preparation). Such an accretion disk not only launches jets, but the asymmetrical structure allows the system to accrete at the Eddington luminosity limit or even somewhat higher. In that model the average accretion rate by the secondary in η Car over the 20 years of the Great Eruption was [formula]; the accretion rate during periastron passages was much higher. A bipolar nebula (the Homunculus) was formed from this activity.

A MS companion accreting from a giant envelope as it spirals-in will not form an accretion disk [\citep=Soker2014] [\citep=MacLeodRamirezRuiz2015]. To ensure the presence of an accretion disk the accretion must be via RLOF while the secondary is outside the envelope before a CE phase, or at the termination of a CE when accretion is from a circumbinary disk [\citep=Soker2014]. In the GEE accretion is via a RLOF. Even if the secondary tries to 'dive' into the envelope, the jets will eject the envelope above and below the secondary star, practically preventing a static envelope to be formed outside the secondary orbit. Another fraction of the envelope is ejected through L2 [\citep=Livioetal1979], and a fraction of the envelope is accreted onto the secondary star.

Preventing engulfment

New results show that the giant envelope will not expand much because of the rapid mass loss [\citep=WoodsIvanova2011] [\citep=Passyetal2012b], and this is not a route to a CE formation. A CE phase can be initiated via a rapid spiraling-in evolution. To prevent a rapid spiraling-in from occurring, in addition to launching jets, the companion must bring the envelope close to synchronization with the orbital motion, i.e., almost co-rotation. Otherwise tidal interaction will be strong and bring the secondary deep into the envelope in a relatively short time. Some departure from synchronization is required to allow a spiraling in process (but not too rapid) due to gravitational drag (tidal forces). This will be the case because mass with specific angular momentum larger than the average in the envelope is lost by mass removal from the envelope.

Tidal interaction becomes strong when the primary radius becomes [formula], where a0 is the orbital separation [\citep=Soker1996]. By the time the binary system has spiraled-in to [formula] the primary envelope must achieve (almost) co-rotation. The moment of inertia of the giant envelope is taken to be I1≃ηMenvR21, where Menv is the convective envelope mass and R1 is the giant radius. For AGB stars and red supergiants η≃0.2 - 0.24. We will consider cases where initially M2  ≪  M1. The above condition to reach synchronization at a≃R1≃0.25 ~ a0 gives a constraint of

[formula]

The system might temporarily evolve through a Darwin unstable phase during which spiraling-in is faster. Mass accretion rate during this phase might also be higher, as well as mass loss through L2. After accretion and removal of some envelope mass, the system regains Darwin stability when IB  >  3I1. Here IB and I1 are the moments of inertia of the binary system and the envelope of the primary star, respectively. The system will become Darwin stable approximately when the secondary to envelope mass becomes [formula] (for η≃0.22). Evolution then slows down.

Evolution time

Evolution time is very difficult to calculate as it is determined by mass transfer rate and tidal interaction. These are only known crudely for these systems. Non the less, we can crudely take the GEE timescale to be determined by the tidal and Kelvin-Helmholtz (thermal) time-scales, τT - ev and τKH - env, respectively. When the envelope mass is low we crudely have [\citep=Soker2008]

[formula]

where Mc is the core mass and L1 is the primary (giant) stellar luminosity.

For the tidal spiral-in timescale I take from equation (6) of [\cite=Soker1996] that is based on [\cite=Zahn1977] and [\cite=VerbuntPhinney1995], assuming that the secondary is somewhat outside the primary a  >  R1,

[formula]

where ω1 is the rotational angular velocity and Ωorb is the orbital angular velocity.

To continue the spiraling-in process a strong interaction must take place between the envelope and the secondary star. The two processes, tidal interaction and the adjustment of the giant envelope to mass loss, must have sufficient time to operate. The slower process determines the spiraling-in time. Overall, I crudely estimate the timescale of the GEE phase that starts at ~  1  ~   to be

[formula]

The corresponding average mass accretion rate by the secondary star is [formula]. I note that the accretion rate onto the companion estimated by [\cite=RickerTaam2012] in their CE numerical simulation is [formula]. So the accretion rate required by the GEE is not as extreme as what the first impression might be.

ENERGY CONSIDERATION

Let us compare the accretion energy with that of the αCE-prescription, EαCE (see also [\citealt=Soker2014]). The gravitational energy released by an accreting MS star is

[formula]

where M2 and R2 are the secondary stellar mass and radius, respectively, and Macc is the accreted mass. The gravitational energy released by the binary system is

[formula]

where Mcore is the mass of the core of the giant star (now the remnant), and afinal is the final core-companion orbital separation. To liberate energy as in the αCE-prescription, the accreted mass onto the secondary star should be

[formula]

Namely, jets launched by a secondary star that accretes ~  10% of its mass can play a significant, and even the major, role in removing the giant envelope. Moreover, the jets can ejects large parts of the envelope at very high velocities, i.e., much above the escape speed from AGB stars. By accreting an extra mass of ΔMacc  =  Macc  -  Macc - α onto a MS star, and assuming that this extra energy is channelled to kinetic energy of the envelope, the typical outflow velocity of the jet-ejected envelope of mass Men - ej is

[formula]

SPECIFIC EXAMPLES

In general the constraints on the parameters for the GEE to take place are estimated as follows. To bring the envelope to almost synchronization with the orbital motion we require [formula] (eq. [\ref=eq:M2min]). As well, the system should get into a close contact. Hence the companion should not bring the envelope to synchronization at a too large orbital separation. This crudely sets a limit of [formula]. The initial orbital separation is like that required for the system to enter a CE phase. And most important, the companion must be a main sequence star (or a brown dwarf), but not a WD. These constraints leave a large parameters space for the GEE. However, there is another important constraint, and that is that the secondary launch two strong jets in a continues manner. If some instabilities stop jets injection for a too long time (about an orbital period), the system will get into a CE phase because without jets the secondary will not be able to remove the envelop gas that overflows its orbit. Determining the process of high-rate mass accretion and jets launching is for futures studies. I turn to discuss two examples.

The bipolar PN NGC 2346 as a possible GEE descendant. A possible case where a GEE could have taken place, at least part of the time, is the PN NGC 2346. This is a bipolar PN (e.g., [\citealt=CorradiSchwarz1995]) with a central binary star, V651 Monocerotis, having an orbital period 15.99 day [\citep=MendezNiemela1981]. [\cite=IbenLivio1993], based on a study by [\cite=IbenTutukov1993], suggested the following evolutionary scenario. The primary, of mass [formula], is a degenerate helium core, while the secondary star, of mass [formula], is a main-sequence star. The orbital semimajor axis is [formula]. [\cite=IbenLivio1993] suggested that the primary overflowed its Roche lobe while on the late red giant branch (RGB; a late case B), and the system entered a CE phase. The initial orbital semimajor axis was ~  1  ~  . During the CE phase the binary system spirals in to its final separation. In [\cite=Soker1998] I proposed that in NGC 2346 and similar PNe, the binary system avoid the CE phase for a large fraction of the interaction time. This is required for the secondary to launch jets that shape the bipolar nebula. But the binary system still needs to spiral-in. The GEE can comprise these two properties.

In short, I argue that the central binary system of NGC 2346, which is the longest of all post-CE central binary systems of PNe, went though a GEE, at least a substantial part of the evolution time.

The Red Rectangle: launching Jets but avoiding GEE. The Red Rectangle is a bipolar nebula around a post-AGB star in a binary system. The binary system, HD 44179, has an orbital period of 318 days, and the secondary star is thought to be a main sequence star of mass [formula] [\citep=Waelkensetal1996] [\citep=Wittetal2009]. The companion launches two jets (e.g., [\citealt=Wittetal2009]) that shape the nebula. The mass transfer rate from the primary post-AGB star to the secondary is [formula] [\citep=Wittetal2009]. This binary system does not enter a GEE as much as it does not enter a CE phase. The reason is that the secondary is massive enough to bring the AGB envelope to synchronization, and the secondary is actually more massive than the primary. Mass transfer and mass loss act to increase the orbital separation.

Saying that, it is possible, but not necessary, that the system went through a GEE phase in the past. In that scenario, when the AGB star was more massive the orbital separation decreased and the AGB radius increased to about the same value. Strong interaction started between the two stars. If this was the case, to avoid a CE phase with a much smaller final orbital separation than observed, jets launched by the secondary star were required to eject a large envelope mass. When the envelope mass decreased enough, and the primary mass decreased below the secondary mass, jets removed the envelope outskirts such that further mass loss and mass transfer increased the orbital separation and spiraling-in ceased. The present nebula was formed during this stable phase. Mass lost in the GEE phase is at very large distances and maybe dispersed already in the ISM.

SUMMARY

In this preliminary study I explored a spiral-in process by which a stellar companion graze the envelope of a giant star and the system does not enter a common envelope (CE) phase. It is termed grazing envelope evolution (GEE). Jets launched by the secondary star are at the heart of the GEE, and distinguish this from a regular mass transfer evolution. The secondary star accretes mass via a RLOF mass transfer such that an accretion disk is formed around it. Jets carry energy from the disk, and most likely lead to accretion of low entropy gas. The accretion through a disk allows therefore a main sequence secondary star to accommodate the accreted mass at a rate of [formula] without inflating a large envelope (section [\ref=subsec:accretion]).

In the GEE the binary system might be viewed as evolving in a constant state of 'just entering a CE phase'. The jets (or disk-wind) launched by the accretion disk remove the envelope from above and below the equatorial plane in the secondary vicinity, preventing the formation of a CE phase. Without the efficiency envelope removal by jets the system would have entered a CE phase. Namely, systems that enter the GEE are the same systems that would have enter a CE phase if it was not for the efficient envelope removal by jets. The drag force is also similar. In the CE phase the spiraling-in is caused mainly by gravitational drag [\citep=RickerTaam2008] [\citep=RickerTaam2012]. The same holds for the GEE, where the gravitational drag is with the envelope mass residing inward to the secondary orbit (hence might be viewed as a tidal force). We can summarize this schematically as follows: (just entering a CE phase)+(efficient jets)→  GEE.

Another ingredient that is necessary to slow down the formation of a CE phase is that the secondary star manages to spin-up the envelope of the giant to almost co-rotation, hence substantially prolonging the tidal spiral-in time scale to tens of year and longer (section [\ref=subsec:engulf]). The over all GEE duration time is tens to hundreds of years (section [\ref=subsec:time]).

While main sequence stars can go through the GEE, WD cannot accrete at a high enough rate and launch jets. The reason is that at a high accretion rate nuclear burning on the surface of the WD inflate an envelope. Therefore, if jets aid indeed in removing the envelope, then WDs are more likely to merge with AGB cores than main sequence stars are. Merger of a WD with a core of an AGB star might eventually lead to a type Ia supernovae according to the core-degenerate scenario [\citep=KashiSoker2011].

The accretion of mass onto a main sequence star over tens of years, with some bright peaks lasting months to few years of higher than average accretion rates, can lead to a transient object termed intermediate luminosity optical transient (ILOT; Red Novae; Red Transients). The binary interaction and the ejection of envelope mass by jets (section [\ref=sec:Energy]) lead to a bipolar nebula and/or equatorial ring around the binary remnant.

What is the relation of the GEE to the CE evolution? It seems that there is a bistable evolutionary situation at hand. If the companion enters the envelope and the accretion flow is more like a Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion from a medium, where an accretion disk does not formed around a main sequence star, then it will spiral-in faster than the ejection of the envelope. The binary system experiences a CE evolution. If an accretion disk that launches jets is formed before the secondary enters the envelope, on the other hand, and the system is more or less synchronized such that tidal spiraling-in time scale is long, the system evolves through the GEE. If for some reason one the the condition ceases to exist, e.g., the primary suffers instabilities and rapidly expands to engulf the secondary star or the secondary suffers instabilities that prevent jets from being lunched, then the binary system jumps from the GEE to the CE phase. The question of when efficient jets, namely efficient in removing the envelope, are formed, is an question to be determined in future studies that involve heavy 3D numerical simulations. Only then we will be able to construct the binary system parameters space for the GEE.
