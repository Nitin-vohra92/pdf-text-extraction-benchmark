Introduction

The Erd os-Szekeres theorem [\cite=erdos] states that for every positive integer m, there exists a smallest integer ES(m), such that any set of at least ES(m) points in the plane, no three on a line, contains m points which lie on the vertices of a convex polygon. The best known bounds on ES(m) are:

[formula]

The lower bound is due to Erd os [\cite=erdosz] and the upper bound is due to Tóth and Valtr [\cite=tothvaltr]. It is known that ES(4) = 5 and ES(5) = 9 [\cite=kalb]. Following a long computer search, Szekeres and Peters [\cite=szekeres] proved that ES(6) = 17. The exact value of ES(m) is unknown for all m > 6, but Erd os conjectured that the lower bound in ([\ref=eq:es_bound]) is, in fact, sharp.

In 1978 Erd os [\cite=erdosempty] asked whether for every positive integer k, there exists a smallest integer H(k), such that any set of at least H(k) points in the plane, no three on a line, contains k points which lie on the vertices of a convex polygon whose interior contains no points of the set. Such a subset is called an empty convex k-gon or a convex k-hole. Esther Klein showed that H(4) = 5 and Harborth [\cite=harborth] proved that H(5) = 10. Horton [\cite=horton] showed that it is possible to construct an arbitrarily large set of points without a 7-hole, thereby proving that H(k) does not exist for k  ≥  7. After a long wait, the existence of H(6) was proved by Gerken [\cite=gerken] and independently by Nicolás [\cite=nicolas]. Later, Valtr [\cite=valtrhexagon] gave a simpler version of Gerken's proof. Recently, Koshelev [\cite=koshelev] has proved that H(6)  ≤   max {ES(8),400}  ≤  463 (the full version of the paper appeared in Russian [\cite=koshelev_russian]). The counting version of this problem, that is, the minimum number Nn(k) of k-holes in a set of n points in general position in the plane, is also widely studied [\cite=barany_valtr_empty_convex_polygons] [\cite=dumitrescu] (for the best known bounds refer to the recent papers by Aichholzer et al. [\cite=aichholzerI] [\cite=aichholzerII] and Valtr [\cite=valtr_count] and the references therein).

The notion of almost empty convex polygons, that is, convex polygons with few interior points, was introduced by Nyklová [\cite=nyklova]. For integers k  ≥  3 and s  ≥  0, let H(k,s) be the minimum positive integer such that any set S of at least H(k,s) points in the plane, no three on a line, contains a subset Z of cardinality k whose elements are on the vertices of a convex k-gon and there are at most s points of S in the interior of the convex hull of Z. It is clear that ES(k)  ≤  H(k,s)  ≤  H(k,0) = H(k). Nyklová [\cite=nyklova] showed that H(6,6)  =  ES(6) = 17 and H(6,5)  =  19. It was also shown that H(k,s) does not exist for every s  ≤  2(k + 6) / 4 - k - 3 [\cite=nyklova]. Recently, Koshelev [\cite=koshelev_almost_empty_hexagon] proved that H(6,1)  ≤  ES(7). Koshelev [\cite=koshelev_computer_solution] [\cite=koshelev_almost_empty_hexagon] also showed that Nyklová's proof is incorrect, and using a computer search based on the Szekeres-McKay-Peters algorithm [\cite=szekeres] proved that H(6,k) = 17, for all 2  ≤  k  ≤  6 and H(6,1) = 18.

Colored variants of the Erd os-Szekeres problem were considered by Devillers et al. [\cite=erdosszekereschromatic]. In such problems, the set of points is partitioned into r  ≥  2 color classes, and a convex polygon is said to be monochromatic if all its vertices belong to the same color class. It is easy to see that any 2-colored point set of size 10 has an empty monochromatic triangle. Grima et al. [\cite=disjoint_monochromatic_triangles] showed that 9 points are necessary and sufficient for a bi-colored point set to have a monochromatic empty triangle. Aichholzer et al. [\cite=aichholzer_triangle_number] proved that any set of n bi-colored points in the plane contains [formula] empty monochromatic triangles, which was later improved to [formula] by Pach and Tóth [\cite=pach_toth_monochromatic_empty_triangles]. Devillers et al. [\cite=erdosszekereschromatic] also constructed a specific coloring for the Horton sets to prove that there exists arbitrarily large 3-colored point sets with no monochromatic empty triangles. Using this they showed that there exists arbitrarily large 2-colored point sets with no monochromatic 5-hole.

It was conjectured by Devillers et al.[\cite=erdosszekereschromatic] that any sufficiently large set of bi-colored points in the plane, no three on a line, contains a monochromatic 4-hole. However, in spite of substantial attempts over the last few years, the problem remains open. Devillers et al.[\cite=erdosszekereschromatic] showed that for n  ≥  64 any bi-chromatic Horton set contains a monochromatic 4-hole. The best known lower bound is a two-colored set of 36 points that contains no monochromatic 4-hole by Huemer and Seara [\cite=huemer_geombinatorics].

As no real progress for the monochromatic empty 4-hole problem was being made, a weaker version arose by relaxing the convexity condition [\cite=pach_non_convex]. Aichholzer et al. [\cite=aichholzer_siam_dm] showed that this relaxed conjecture is indeed true. They proved that if the cardinality of the bi-chromatic point set S is at least 5044, there always exists an empty monochromatic 4-gon spanned by S, that need not be convex. Using observations on vertex degree parity constraints for triangulations of S, this bound was lowered to 2760 points by Aichholzer et al. [\cite=aiccholzer_parity_wads].

To the best of our knowledge, the analogous version of the almost empty convex polygon problem for colored point sets has never been considered. In this paper, we initiate the study of the combinatorial quantities associated with the existence of monochromatic empty polygons with few interior points in colored point sets. For positive integers c,s  ≥  1 and r  ≥  3 define Mr(c,s) to be the least integer such that any set of at least Mr(c,s) points in the plane, no three on a line, and colored with c colors contains a monochromatic convex polygon of r vertices and with at most s interior points. In this paper, we primarily concentrate on almost empty monochromatic triangles, that is, the case r = 3. The case s = 0, which corresponds to empty monochromatic triangles, has been studied extensively over the last few years. We already mentioned that M3(1,0) = 3, M3(2,0) = 9 [\cite=disjoint_monochromatic_triangles] and M3(c,0) =   ∞  , for c  ≥  3 [\cite=erdosszekereschromatic]. In this paper we extend these results when c  ≥  3 and s  ≥  1. We begin by showing that

M3(3,1) = 13.

Using this result and induction on c, and a Horton set construction, we obtain the main result of the paper:

For c  ≥  2, the least integer λ3(c) such that M3(c,λ3(c)) <   ∞   satisfies:

[formula]

To prove the lower bound in Theorem [\ref=th:lambda] we use colored Horton sets. The bounds obtained in this way are equal for c∈{2,3}. For c = 4, the first value for which the bounds in Theorem [\ref=th:lambda] do not match, we show that

Any Horton set with at least 26 points colored arbitrarily with 4 colors contains a monochromatic triangle with at most 1 interior point.

Due to the above theorem and several other observations we conjecture that the lower bound in Theorem [\ref=th:lambda] is also tight for c = 4, that is, every sufficiently large 4-colored point set contains a monochromatic triangle with at most 1 interior point.

Preliminaries

We begin by introducing the definitions and notation required for the remainder of the paper. Let S be a finite set of points in the plane in general position, that is, no three on a line. Denote the convex hull of S by CH(S). The boundary vertices of CH(S), and the interior of CH(S) are denoted by V(CH(S)) and I(CH(S)), respectively. Finally, for any finite set Z  ⊆  S, |Z| denotes the cardinality of Z.

A set of points S in general position is said to be c-colored if S can be partitioned into c non-empty sets [formula], where each set Si will be referred to as the set of points of color i, and [formula] denotes the union of disjoint sets. A subset T  ⊂  S is called monochromatic if all its points have the same color.

A triangulation of a set of points S in the plane in general position is a triangulation of the convex hull of S, with all points from S being among the vertices of the triangulation. We now recall a few standard facts from triangulations of point-sets that we shall use repeatedly in the subsequent sections.

For any set S of points in the plane in general position, the number of triangles in any triangulation of S is 2|S| - |V(CH(S))| - 2.

Since for point sets in general position |V(CH(S))|  ≤  |S|, the following is an immediate consequence of the above fact:

For any set S of points in the plane in general position, the number of triangles in any triangulation of S is at least |S| - 2.

Grima et al. [\cite=disjoint_monochromatic_triangles] proved that every 2-colored 9-point set contains a monochromatic empty triangle. Moreover, there exists a set of 8 points with 4 points colored red and 4 points colored blue and no empty monochromatic triangle. In the following lemma we show that this is the only possible distribution of 2 colors among 8 points that can lead to a point set with no monochromatic empty triangles.

Let [formula] be a 2-colored point set with color class R and B, with |S| = 8 and |R|  ≠  |B|. Then S always contains an empty monochromatic triangle.

Without loss of generality we assume that |R| > |B|, so |R|  ≥  5. If |R|  ≥  6, then by Fact [\ref=fact2] we get at least four triangles by triangulating R. Since |B|  ≤  2 we obtain an empty triangle in R. If |R| = 5 and |V(CH(R))|  ≤  4, then we get at least four triangles in R by Fact [\ref=fact1]. In this case we have |B| = 3, so we again obtain a monochromatic empty triangle in R. If |V(CH(R))| = 5, then there is an empty triangle in R unless [formula]. In that case, the 3 points in B form an empty triangle.

Monochromatic Triangles with At Most 1 Interior Point: Few Exact Values

In this section we obtain the exact values of M3(c,1) for c  ≤  3. These results will be used later on in the proofs of the main theorem, and are also interesting in their own right.

M3(2,1) = 6.

We observe that M3(2,1) > 5, by arbitrarily placing 2 blue-colored points inside a red-colored triangle.

Consider a set of 6 points colored arbitrarily with 2 colors, red and blue. Let R and B denote the set of red and blue points respectively. Without loss of generality assume that |R|  ≥  |B|. If |R|  ≥  4, by Fact [\ref=fact2] we can partition R in at least two interior disjoint triangles. In this case, |B|  ≤  2 and we have a monochromatic triangle in R with at most one interior point. If |R| = |B| = 3, then there is a monochromatic triangle with at most one interior point whenever [formula]. Otherwise, [formula] and the monochromatic triangle spanned by B has at most one interior point.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=th:31]

Figure [\ref=fig1] shows that M3(3,1)  ≥  13. Therefore, to prove the theorem it suffices to show that M3(3,1)  ≤  13.

Let [formula] be a any set of 13 points colored by 3 colors. The three color classes R,B,G, will be referred to as red, blue, and green, respectively. Assume, without loss of generality, that |R|  ≥  |B|  ≥  |G|. As |R| + |B| + |G| = 13, we have |R|  ≥  5. We now have the following cases:

This completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=th:31], where the exact value of M3(3,1) is obtained. In the following section we show that M3(5,1) =   ∞  . It remains open to determine whether M3(4,1) is finite. More discussions about M3(4,1) are in Section [\ref=sec:41].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=th:lambda]

In this section bounds on λ3(c) as stated in Theorem [\ref=th:lambda] will be proved. Note that λ3(c) is the least integer such that M3(c,λ3(c))  <    ∞  . Proofs of the upper and lower bounds are presented separately in two sections. First it is shown that M3(c,c - 2)  ≤  c2 + c + 1 for c  ≥  3, that is, any c-colored point set with cardinality at least c2 + c + 1 contains a monochromatic triangle with at most c - 2 interior points. This proves that λ3(c)  ≤  c - 2. In the next section, constructing colorings for the Horton set, the lower bound on λ3(c) is proved.

Proof of Upper Bound

We begin with the following lemma where an upper bound on M3(c,c - 1) is obtained. This bound will then be used to bound M3(c,c - 2).

For c  ≥  2, M3(c,c - 1)  ≤   max {c2  +  1,6}

Let the c colors be indexed by [formula] and S be a any set of c2 + 1 points in the plane colored by c colors. The result will be proved by induction on c. The base case c = 2 is true as M3(2,1) = 6 by Proposition [\ref=lm1].

Now, assume that c  ≥  3 and M3(c - 1,c - 2)  ≤   max {(c - 1)2 + 1,6}. Let S1  ⊆  S be the set of points with color 1. As |S| = c2 + 1, by the pigeon-hole principle, it can be assumed that |S1|  ≥  c + 1.

If |S1|  ≥  c + 2, by Fact [\ref=fact2] any triangulation of S1 has at least c triangles. There exists a monochromatic triangle of color 1 with at most c - 1 interior points unless each of the triangles in any triangulation of S1 contains at least c interior points. This implies that |S|  ≥  c2 + |S1|  ≥  c2 + c + 2, which is impossible.

Therefore, |S1| = c + 1. In this case any triangulation of S1 has at least c - 1 triangles. If any triangulation of S1 has c triangles, then by similar arguments as before there exists a monochromatic triangle with at most c - 1 interior points. This implies that any triangulation of S1 contains exactly c - 1 triangles, that is, |V(CH(S1))| = c + 1. Let [formula]. Note that if |S- 1|  ≤  c(c - 1) - 1, then there exists a monochromatic triangle of color 1, with at most c - 1 interior points. Hence, it suffices to assume that |S- 1|  ≥  c(c - 1)  ≥  M3(c - 1,c - 2). As |S- 1| is a set of points colored with c - 1 colors, by induction hypothesis there exists monochromatic triangle in |S- 1| with at most c - 2 interior points.

Completing the Proof of the Upper Bound

For c = 2, it is known that M3(2,0) = 9 [\cite=disjoint_monochromatic_triangles], which implies that λ3(2) = 0. For c  ≥  3, it will be shown by induction on c that M3(c,c - 2) < c2  +  c  +  1. The base case c = 3 is true as M3(3,1)  =  13 by Theorem [\ref=th:31].

Let c  ≥  4 and S be any set of c2 + c + 1 points in the plane colored by c colors, and assume that the theorem is true for c - 1, that is, M3(c - 1,c - 3)  ≤  c2  -  c  +  1. Let S1  ⊆  S be the set of points with color 1. As |S| = c2 + c + 1, by the pigeon-hole principle, it can be assumed that |S1|  ≥  c + 2.

If |S1|  ≥  c + 3, by Fact [\ref=fact2] any triangulation of S1 has at least c + 1 triangles. There exists a monochromatic triangle with at most c - 2 interior points unless each of the triangles in any triangulation of S1 contains at least c - 1 interior points. This implies that |S|  ≥  (c - 1)(c + 1) + |S1|  ≥  c2 + c + 2, which is impossible.

Therefore, |S1| = c + 2. If |V(CH(S1))|  ≤  c, then any triangulation of S1 has at least c + 2 triangles. By similar arguments as before, there exists a monochromatic triangle with at most c - 2 interior points. Therefore, it suffices to assume that c + 1  ≤  |V(CH(S1))|  ≤  c + 2. These two cases are considered separately as follows:

Proof of Lower Bound

In this section we prove the lower bound on λ3(c) by appropriately coloring a Horton set with c colors. A Horton set is a set H of n points sorted by x-coordinates: [formula], such that the set [formula] of the even points and the set [formula] of the odd points are Horton sets and any line through two even points (the upper set) leaves all odd points below and any line through two odd points (the lower set) leaves all even points above. A Horton set of size n can be recursively obtained by adding a large vertical separation after intertwining in the x-direction an upper Horton set H+ of size ⌊n / 2⌋ and a lower set H- of size ⌈n / 2⌉ [\cite=horton].

With these definitions the following observation can be proved easily.

Let [formula] be a Horton set, sorted in the increasing order of the x-coordinates. For any line joining hi and hj, define Hij as all points of H with x-coordinates between that of hi and hj. Also we define [formula] and [formula]. If i∈H+ and j∈H- (or vice versa), then the line joining hi∈H+ and hj has all points of H+ij above it and all points of H-ij below it.

Let hk∈Hij be a point which is below the line joining hi and hj. If hk∈H+ij, then the line through hi∈H+ and hk∈H+ leaves hj∈H- above, which is not the case for the Horton set since any 2 points of H+, when joined by a line must have all points of H- below it. Hence, hk∈H-ij.

Similarly, it can be shown that all points which are above the line joining hi and hj are in H+ij.

Using the above lemma we now complete the proof of the lower bound. Let c  =  2q  +  1 be an odd number. The c colors are indexed by [formula]. Consider a Horton set H of size n and arrange the points [formula] of H in increasing order of x-coordinates. Color H with these c colors as follows:

The points [formula] are colored by color 1. [formula] are colored by color 2, and in general, the points [formula] by color i, for [formula]. As c = 2q + 1 is odd, this coloring splits in a similar pattern in H+ and H-, that is, H- is colored in cyclical manner as [formula] and so on, and H+ is colored in cyclical manner as [formula] and so on. The coloring scheme with 5 colors is illustrated in Figure [\ref=fig2].

If c = 2q + 2 is an even number, and a Horton set H of size n is given, then color the rightmost point of H with color 2q + 2. The remaining n - 1 points are colored with c - 1 colors as before.

Hereafter, we assume that c is odd. The proof for the case c is even can be done similarly. Let Δ  =  {ha,hb,hc} be a monochromatic triangle in a Horton set H, colored with 2q + 1 colors as above. From the inductive definition of a Horton set, w.l.o.g. it suffices to assume hb,hc∈H- and ha∈H+. The coloring is done in such a way that the points in H+ have all the 2q + 1 colors. Let Hbc,H-bc and H+bc be defined as before.

By our coloring scheme and using the fact that hb,hc∈H-, we get |Hbc| = 4γq + 2γ - 1 and |H-bc| = 2γq + γ - 1 for some [formula]. By recursively breaking H- into smaller Horton sets, after some steps hb and hc must belong to the upper set and lower set, respectively, of some subset of H- (say H0) which is itself another Horton set. So by Proposition [\ref=lm6] if hb∈H0+ and hc∈H0- the line hbhc will have at least q points of H0+  ⊂  H- above it. Moreover, these q points, since they are in H-, must either lie beneath the line hahb or beneath the line hahc. Therefore, the monochromatic triangle hahbhc must have at least q interior points. This proves that any monochromatic triangle in H must have at least q interior points.

Therefore, we have shown that it is possible to construct arbitrarily large sets of points which when colored with c-colors, has no monochromatic triangle with less than q interior points. This implies that M3(2q + 2,q - 1) = M3(2q + 1,q - 1) =   ∞   and hence [formula]. This completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=th:lambda].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=th:41_restriction]

In this section we prove that any sufficiently large Horton set colored arbitrarily with 4 colors contains a monochromatic triangle with at most 1 interior point. To this end, let [formula] be a 4 colored Horton set of size 26. If all the 4 colors are not present in H+ (respectively H-), then by Theorem [\ref=th:31] there exists a monochromatic triangle with at most 1 interior point in H+ (respectively H-). Therefore, assume that all the 4-colors are present in both H+ and H-. W.l.o.g. let ha  <  xhb be two points in H- of same color, such that the colors of all points of H- in between ha and hb are different from that color. We can choose that color such that b - a∈{2,4,6}.

This completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=th:41_restriction] and strengthens evidence for the following conjecture:

Every sufficiently large set of points in the plane, in general position, colored arbitrarily with 4 colors contains a monochromatic triangle with at most 1 interior point.

Conclusions

In this paper, we study the existence of monochromatic empty triangles with few interior points. We prove that any large enough c-colored point set contains a monochromatic triangle with at most c - 2 interior points. Using a Horton set construction, we also show that for any c  ≥  2, there exist arbitrarily large c-colored point sets in which every monochromatic triangle contains at least [formula] interior points.

This paper just scratches the surface of the almost empty monochromatic polygon problem. Several interesting questions are left open. Improving the bounds on λ3(c) and proving Conjecture [\ref=conjecture1] are the main challenges. Generalizing these results to monochromatic convex r-gons would also be interesting.
