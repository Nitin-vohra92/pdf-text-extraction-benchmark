Binary orbits as the driver of γ-ray emission and mass ejection in classical novae

The identification of the γ-ray transient J0639+0548, detected by NASA?s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, with the classical nova V959 Mon[\cite=Cheung13] was a surprise, because gigaelectronvolt γ-rays are produced via the Inverse Compton, the pion production mechanism, or both[\cite=Dubus13], requiring a population of relativistic particles which had not been predicted or observed in normal classical novae. Gigaelectronvolt γ-rays had only been reported from one nova previous to V959 Mon, in a system with an unusual Mira giant companion, dense circumbinary material, and thereby strong shock interaction between the nova ejecta and surroundings[\cite=Abdo10]. The white dwarf in V959 Mon, on the other hand, has a main sequence companion and therefore a low-density circumbinary environment[\cite=Munari13] [\cite=Hoard14], and so there is no apparent mechanism for diffusive shock acceleration in an interaction with surrounding material.

The γ-ray emission from V959 Mon was discovered on 2012 June 19 (day 0) and lasted ~  12 d, showing a soft-spectrum continuum[\cite=Cheung13]. Little is known about V959 Mon during the period of γ-ray emission owing to its solar conjunction in the first few months of outburst, which prevented optical observations; the transient was not even identified as a nova until 56 d after γ-ray discovery[\cite=Cheung13]. However, we obtained early radio observations coincident with the Fermi detections using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), just 12 and 16 d after discovery (Fig. 1). These observations span a frequency range 1-6 GHz and show a flat radio spectrum (α  ≈   - 0.1, where [formula]; ν is the observing frequency and Sν is the flux density at this frequency). This spectral index is much more consistent with synchrotron radiation than the expected optically-thick emission from warm nova ejecta[\cite=Seaquist08] [\cite=Roy13] (α  ≈  2 is predicted and observed in V959 Mon at later times; Fig. 1; Extended Data Fig. 1).

Like gigaelectronvolt γ-rays, synchrotron emission requires a population of relativistic particles, so we can use this radio emission as a tracer of γ-ray production that lasts longer and enables much higher spatial resolution than do the γ-rays themselves. The location of the γ-ray producing shocks was revealed by milliarcsecond-resolution radio imaging using very-long-baseline interferometric (VLBI) techniques, which are sensitive to high-surface-brightness synchrotron emission. VLBI observations were achieved with the European VLBI Network (EVN) and Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), and spanned 2012 September 18 to October 30 (91-133 d after γ-ray discovery; 2-7 mas resolution; 1 mas ≈  2  ×  1013 cm at the distance of V959 Mon[\cite=Munari13]; Extended Data Table 3). The first VLBI epoch revealed two distinct knots of emission separated by 36 mas, which we subsequently observed to travel away from one another at an estimated rate, ~  0.4 mas d- 1 (Fig. 2a). In addition, a third radio component appeared in our imaging from day 113. The brightest component was slightly resolved by the VLBA on day 106 (Extended Data Fig. 2), and had a peak brightness temperature, [formula] K, indicative of non-thermal emission (X-ray observations from around this time[\cite=Nelson12] imply that hot shocked thermal gas can only account for <  10% of the radio flux density seen in the VLBI knots; see Supplementary Information).

Observations made with the e-MERLIN array (54 mas resolution) just before the first VLBI epoch shows that the compact VLBI components were embedded in a larger-scale structure which was mostly extended east-west (and not detected in the VLBI imaging, because these high-resolution arrays with widely separated antennas are not sensitive to such diffuse emission; Fig. 2b). This diffuse emission is interpreted as thermal bremsstrahlung from the bulk of the nova ejecta[\cite=Seaquist08] [\cite=Roy13]. Whereas the 5 GHz flux density detected in our VLBI imaging was roughly constant or declining with time, the flux density detected in the lower-resolution observations rapidly increased during this period (Fig. 1). The VLBI knots comprised 19% and 9% of the total 5 GHz flux density on days 91 and 117 respectively, implying that over time, the synchrotron emission becomes overwhelmed by thermal emission from the warm ejecta. Although synchrotron radio emission has been detected from outbursting novae with red giant companions and dense circumbinary material[\cite=Seaquist89] [\cite=O'Brien06] [\cite=Kantharia14], it has not previously been securely identified in novae with main sequence companions[\cite=Seaquist08], owing to a paucity of high-resolution radio imaging enabling components of differing surface brightness to be clearly distinguished.

The expanding thermal ejecta were resolved with the VLA when it entered its high-resolution A configuration. An image from 2012 October 23 (day 126; 43 mas resolution) shows that the ejecta have expanded and assumed a clearly bipolar geometry consistent with analyses of optical spectral line profiles[\cite=Ribeiro13] [\cite=Shore13] (Fig. 2c). The apparent geometry of the ejecta is conveniently simplified, because we view the orbital plane of V959 Mon edge-on[\cite=Page13]. Our imaging illustrates that the VLBI knots were not simple jet-like protrusions from the thermal ejecta. First, there were three VLBI knots when only two are expected from a bipolar jet structure. Second, the major axis of the thermal ejecta (directed east-west) was not well aligned with the expansion of the VLBI knots, but offset by 45[formula]. In addition, the thermal ejecta expanded faster than the VLBI knots (0.64 mas/day in diameter; Extended Data Fig. 3). Finally, because the warm thermal ejecta were optically thick at the time of this imaging, the VLBI knots were superimposed around the edges of the ejecta, appearing to surround the two thermal lobes.

The origin of the compact radio knots was clarified when we revisited V959 Mon sixteen months later, when the VLA was next in A configuration (2014 February 24; day 615; Fig. 2d). The much-expanded thermal ejecta maintained a bi-lobed morphology--but the axis of elongation had rotated so that the brightest regions were oriented north-south, perpendicular to the outflow observed in 2012. The position angle of the VLBI knots lay roughly halfway between that of the early and late axes of ejecta expansion (Fig. 2).

This apparent rotation of the thermal ejecta between day 126 and day 615 was due to the outflow being faster along the east-west axis, with the result that the east-west lobes became optically thin first. Just such an asymmetry is predicted by hydrodynamic simulations of interacting winds shaped by orbital evolution[\cite=Soker89]. In this scenario, binary stars orbiting within the nova envelope transfer some of their orbital energy to the surrounding material through viscous interaction, thereby expelling the envelope preferentially along the orbital plane[\cite=Livio90] [\cite=Lloyd97] (Fig. 3a), corresponding to a north-south orientation in V959 Mon. This equatorial material is observable as thermal ejecta, but it expands relatively slowly, and its compact structure therefore proves difficult to image at early times. Meanwhile, a fast prolonged wind is blown off the white dwarf[\cite=Kato94], and this thermal wind preferentially expands along the low-density polar directions[\cite=Porter98] (Fig. 3b). At early times, while the ejecta are optically thick, this fast material expanding along the poles will dominate the radio images, as in Fig. 2c. Later, when the thermal radio emission becomes optically thin, the dense material in the orbital plane will be brightest (Figs. 2d and 3c). A similar 90 degree flip of the major axis has been hinted at in radio imaging of other novae[\cite=Taylor88] [\cite=Eyres92] [\cite=Heywood05], suggesting that such a transformation may be common in classical novae.

The VLBI knots, and by extension the γ-ray emission, appear to be produced in the interaction between the rapidly expanding material driven along the poles and the slower equatorial material (Fig. 3c). This interaction within the ejecta could explain the prolonged duration of the radio synchrotron emission[\cite=Shankar91], lasting as long as the fast wind flows past the dense material concentrated in the orbital plane.

The mass ejection observed in V959 Mon is a version of the common envelope phase that occurs in all close binary stars, and is a critical step in the formation of diverse phenomena like X-ray binaries, Type Ia supernovae, and stripped-envelope supernovae. Despite its widespread significance, common envelope evolution remains one of the most poorly understood phases of binary evolution, with few observational tests and models that often fail to expel the envelope at all[\cite=Passy12] [\cite=Ivanova13]. V959 Mon shows that classical novae can serve as a testbed for developing an understanding of common envelope evolution, and that common-envelope interaction plays a role in ejecting nova envelopes.

An extensive multi-wavelength observational campaign shows V959 Mon to be a typical classical nova. Its expansion velocities, spectral line profiles, binary period, binary companion, and optical light curve fall well within expected ranges[\cite=Munari13] [\cite=Ribeiro13] [\cite=Shore13] [\cite=Page13]. Additionally, after the few early epochs showing a flat radio spectrum, the radio light curve of V959 Mon became consistent with thermal emission from expanding warm ejecta, implying [formula] M[formula] of ejected mass (a typical value for a classical nova[\cite=Gehrz98]; Extended Data Fig. 4; Supplementary Information). The only unusual characteristic of V959 Mon is its proximity; at a distance of [formula]2 kpc[\cite=Munari13], it is several times closer than the typical nova which explodes in the Galactic bulge (d ≈   8 kpc). Therefore, γ-rays could be a common feature of normal classical novae.

Since the outburst of V959 Mon, three additional classical novae have been identified with Fermi[\cite=Cheung13] [\cite=Cheung13a], further implying that V959 Mon is not unusual, and many novae produce γ-rays. The recent uptick in Fermi detections of novae can likely be explained by a combination of deeper, targeted detection efforts and a lucky crop of nearby novae; with effort, the sample of γ-ray-detected novae will continue to grow. The mechanism we propose here for powering the γ-ray emission in V959 Mon--binary interaction shaping nova ejecta and powering strong internal shocks--works in most novae, implying that each of these garden-variety explosions accelerates particles to relativistic speeds.
