Two-Photon Absorption in Gapped Bilayer Graphene with a Tunable Chemical Potential

The excitement following the isolation of graphene is due in part to the remarkable optoelectronic properties that the material possesses [\cite=geim1] [\cite=geim2]. In addition to possessing a high electron mobility[\cite=mobility] and fast optical response[\cite=ultrafast], graphene and its bilayer (BLG) exhibit tunable broadband optical absorption[\cite=abergel_falko] [\cite=abergel_das_sarma] [\cite=modulator1] [\cite=geim2], suggesting applicability to such devices as optical modulators [\cite=modulator1] [\cite=modulator2], photodetectors[\cite=photodetector1] [\cite=photodetector2], and possibly all-optical switches[\cite=switch1] [\cite=switch2] [\cite=switch3] [\cite=switch4]. Recent studies have revealed that graphene possesses a large third-order susceptibility[\cite=four-wave1] [\cite=four-wave2], leading to a strong two-photon absorption (2PA) coefficient[\cite=photonics_review] - which is stronger yet in the bilayer system[\cite=giant2PA] due to the nested manifold of bands present at the K-point of the Brillouin zone. Due to this K-point band-commensuration and the larger number of absorptive pathways, the 2PA coefficient for the ungapped bilayer system is several orders of magnitude higher than that of monolayer graphene (MLG) in certain frequency ranges[\cite=giant2PA].

Although the nonlinear optical properties of bilayer graphene have been studied in depth, a theoretical characterization of the 2PA strength in doped, gapped BLG has yet to be reported. Furthermore, calculations of the 2PA coefficient[\cite=giant2PA] in the ungapped system do not appear to encompass all possible intermediate states. Here, we compute using a perturbative approach the full one- and two-photon absorption coefficients for a graphene bilayer with a band gap and a tunable chemical potential. The physical scenario we discuss is a back-gated graphene bilayer placed underneath a transparent top gate (see, for example, Ref. [\cite=bolometer]), providing simultaneous and independent control over the chemical potential, μ, and the asymmetry gap, Δ. The one-photon absorption (1PA) spectrum for the gapped system has been computed previously by Nicol and Carbotte[\cite=carbotte], which we reproduce for comparison to the 2PA spectrum.

An electric field oriented perpendicular to a Bernal-stacked graphene bilayer gives rise to an asymmetry gap[\cite=mccann], for which the tight-binding Hamiltonian in the K-valley using the basis (A1,B2,A2,B1) in the sublattice space is

[formula]

We use the following notation: φ  =   tan - 1(py / px) is the polar angle of the in-plane momentum, [formula]; [formula] is the reduced momentum; γ1  =  0.4 eV is the A2-B1 interlayer coupling; and [formula] m/s is the Fermi velocity. The corresponding eigenvalues and eigenvectors, respectively, are

[formula]

and

[formula]

where j  =  1 (2) denotes the low-energy (high-energy) bands split by Δ at the K-point; Nj is a normalization factor; and [formula]. For an incident field with polarization chosen along the x direction, [formula] the interaction Hamiltonian is

[formula]

Assuming a relative permittivity εr  ≈  9 for BLG[\cite=epsilonr] [\cite=epsilonr_note] and an incident irradiance [formula], perturbation theory gives the one- and two-photon absorption coefficients[\cite=nathan] [\cite=vanstryland], which are, respectively,

[formula]

and

[formula]

where [formula] is the n-photon absorption coefficient; Wn represents the nth-order interband transition probability rate per unit area; g = 4 is a factor accounting for spin and valley degeneracy; and the subscripts label the initial (i), intermediate (I) and final (f) states.

Figure 1 shows the band structure at the K-point for a gapped graphene bilayer. The interband 1PA and 2PA transitions are shown, each of which must satisfy the constraints of energy and momentum conservation imposed by the δ-functions in the expressions for βn. For the case of 1PA, the thick black arrows in Fig. 1(a)-(d) denote the four one-photon pathways (T1-T4) permitted from εi  →  εf for a neutral chemical potential (μ = 0) at a temperature of T = 0 K. The thick arrow in the fifth panel, Fig. 1(e), illustrates T5, the transition allowed from ε+1  →  ε+2 when μ > 0.

Associated with each 1PA transition is a family of possible 2PA pathways[\cite=rioux], which Fig. 1 illustrates with thin red arrows. In the case of 2PA, two photons are absorbed simultaneously via two energy-nonconserving transitions of |i〉  →  |I〉 and |I〉  →  |f〉 -- for which energy is conserved over |i〉  →  |f〉. For each of the initial- and final-state combinations, four pathways are possible, all of which are indicated in Fig. 1. The energy-degenerate transitions T3 and T4 are displayed in Fig. 1(c) and (d). A determination of the criteria imposed on T1-T5 by energy conservation requires the calculation of several important energy values, which are provided for reference in Fig.1(f) using the nomenclature of Nicol and Carbotte[\cite=carbotte]. Though we confine our analysis to the cases of positive and neutral chemical potential ([formula]), the effect of negative chemical potential (μ < 0) on the absorption is identical to that of [formula] due to electron-hole symmetry.

The diagrams in Fig. 1 and the denominator of Eq. ([\ref=2OP]) allow for several immediate insights into the frequency response of β2. The transitions taking part in the 2PA process for which |i〉  →  |I = i〉 or |I〉  →  |f = I〉, denoted by circular arrows, produce a singularity in β2 at ω  =  0, while the contributions for which Δεf,i  =  2ω  =  2γ1 when Δ = 0 produce a singularity at γ1. Similarly, 2PA transitions for which Δεf,i  =  2ω  =  γ1 give rise to a singularity at ω  =  γ1  /  2 when Δ  =  0. For 1PA when μ  ≥  0 and T > 0, a singularity exists only due to T5, which generates an intense, narrow peak at ω  =  γ1 when bands ε+1 and ε+2 are perfectly nested. This peak will exist for T > 0 even when μ  =  0 due to thermal population of conduction band ε+1(ρ) and depopulation of valence band ε-1(ρ).

When an asymmetry gap Δ  >  0 is present, the conditions imposed by energy conservation become more complex[\cite=carbotte] due to the so-called "sombrero" structure[\cite=mccann] of the low-energy bands ε±1. No longer are the bands perfectly nested as for Δ = 0, leading to the rich absorptive structure displayed in Fig. 2. Figure 2 shows color plots of both the 1PA and 2PA coefficients, [formula] for a wide range of gap values, Δ. A transformation of ω  →  ω  +  iΓ  /   accounts for thermal broadening; we take Γ  =  5.4  ×  10- 3 γ1, which corresponds to a temperature of T = 25 K.

The finite broadening associated with Fig. 2 leads to the emergence in (a) of an intense, narrow peak at Ω  =  γ1 due to T5 for Δ  =  0 (see Ref. [\cite=Delta0note]). At T  =  25 K, band ε+1 receives spectral weight due to thermal population, giving rise to T5 transitions of ε+1  →  ε+2. Similarly, in the β2 spectrum for Δ  =  0 in Fig.1(b), the thermal smearing of μ leads to a peak at Ω  =  γ1 / 2 -- as anticipated during the analysis of Fig. 1. When Δ increases, the T5 component of both β1 and β2 broadens into the cleaver-shaped regions outlined in green for Δ  =  1.25γ1 in Fig. 2(a,b). The asymmetric broadening of the T5 region is due to the sombrero shape of ε±1 and the loss of spectral weight when μ  >  E02. The panels corresponding to Δ  =  1.5γ1 in Fig. 2(a) and (b) identify the energy thresholds mapped in Fig. 1(f), illustrating regions where an adjustable μ either blocks or permits absorptive pathways. For Δ > 0, the band gap means that there is no absorption at Ω < 2Eg1 and the increased density of states at the band edge produces regions of increasing 1PA and 2PA near the T1 cutoff. The other spectrally empty region that emerges with increasing Δ occurs between the T3/T4 and T5 pockets.

In contrast with the Δεf,i  =  ω requirement of 1PA, 2PA requires Δεf,i  =  2ω, which compresses and shifts the T1-T5 regions in β2 relative to those β1. In addition, the spectra for β2 shown in Fig. 2(b) contain a prominent resonance not present in β1. This β2 resonance, arising at Ω = 1 when Δ = 0, is due to transitions T3 and T4, which contain denominators of ω  -  γ1 and give rise to a singularity. As Δ increases, this resonance shifts toward higher Ω due to the increasing size of the band gap. At this T3/T4 resonance, the BLG 2PA strength is several orders of magnitude larger for bilayer graphene than for monolayer graphene [\cite=giant2PA].

Figure 3 presents 1PA and 2PA curves extracted from the color maps of Fig. 2, which are grouped by gap value and, from left to right, display β1(Ω,μ), β2(Ω,μ), the density of states[\cite=carbotte] N(ε), and the Δ-dependent energy dispersions. For each plot of β1 and β2, several values of μ are chosen, each of which corresponds to an identical horizontal line on the accompanying dispersion plot in the rightmost column. The solid black curves relate to μ = 0, while the dotted red and dashed blue curves represent μ = (Eg1 + E01) / 2 and (E01 + E02) / 2, respectively. The dotted red line bisects the sombrero region; the dashed blue line lies halfway between ε+1 and ε+2 at ρ = 0. When Δ = 0, the dotted red slice is equivalent to that of μ = 0, so that the solid black and dotted red lines are identical. As Ω  →    ∞  , the contributions to β2 of transitions T1-T4 tend to 1 / Ω4.

Figure 3 reveals an intense, narrow peak in β2 that emerges when [formula], resulting from two |i〉  →  |I〉 routes within the family of T3 and T4 pathways. In particular, routes ε-1  →  ε+1 and ε-1  →  ε-2 lead to a vanishing denominator εI   -   εi   -   ω in Eq. ([\ref=2OP]) at values of

[formula]

When Ω  =  ΩA and [formula] for Γ = 0, the position of the peak, ΩA, eclipses the T3/T4 cutoff, causing the peak to appear when the photon energy ω  =  Ωγ1 coincides with ε+1  -  ε-1  ≥  (E01 + E02) / 2 and ε-1  -  ε-2  ≥  (E01 + E02) / 2.

Figure 4 (a) and (b) show β1 and β2 as a function of Ω and Δ for T = 25 K and μ = 0. As Δ increases from 0, certain regions of increasing intensity materialize in both 1PA and 2PA spectra, including the peak in β2 at ΩA, which is outlined in Figure 4 (b) by a dashed purple box surrounding the point [formula]. The inset in Fig. 4(b) provides a zoomed-in view of the boxed region, in which the dotted black line indicates the T3/T4 cutoff, and the dashed blue line shows the onset of the emerging peak. Thus far, the assumed thermal broadening corresponds to a temperature of 25 K -- a value large enough to reveal the T5 resonance when μ  =  0, yet small enough to avoid the smearing of fine features. Figure 4 (c) and (d) illustrate the effect of thermal broadening on β1 and β2 for Δ  =  0.2γ1 at neutral doping (μ = 0). The most pronounced impact of increasing temperature is the broadening of β1 and β2 into the gap region. Once Γ reaches room temperature, the otherwise abrupt T3/T4 cutoff just beyond Ω  =  1 spreads into a more diffuse spectral bulge. Similarly, the sharp β2 resonance residing near Ω  =  1 at T = 10 K suffers appreciably within the temperature range examined, dropping in intensity by more than two orders of magnitude when T  =  300 K.

We have demonstrated that when an electric field is applied perpendicular to a graphene bilayer, the resulting asymmetry gap gives rise to complex linear and nonlinear optical absorption. For the gapped bilayer system with a tunable chemical potential, we have calculated both one- and two-photon absorption spectra over an expansive range of the gap and chemical potential, taking into account all possible absorption pathways in the calculation of β2(Ω,μ). We analyze the 2PA resonances that emerge in the gapped, doped bilayer system, and examine the evolution of these resonances as a function of Δ and μ. The effects of thermal broadening are incorporated into the computations, providing insight into the degradation of optical performance at or near room temperature. As graphene-based optical architectures mature, the absorption spectra calculated above will prove important for optimizing and enhancing device performance.
