Differentiation and factoring: Gauss-Lucas type theorems on the disk

Introduction and results

If f is a holomorphic - or perhaps meromorphic - function living (at least) on a domain [formula], we write [formula] for its zero set there. Thus,

[formula]

The Gauss-Lucas theorem tells us that, given a nonconstant polynomial P, the set of its critical points, [formula], is contained in the convex hull of [formula]; see, e.g., [\cite=ShSm].

This classical fact admits a certain hyperbolic" analog, which was found by Walsh [\cite=W]. The plane [formula] is now replaced by the unit disk

[formula]

while the role of polynomials is played by finite Blaschke products. A (finite) Blaschke product B of degree n is, by definition, given by

[formula]

(with some [formula] and a unimodular constant c), a formula known to provide the general form of an n-to-1 mapping from [formula] onto itself. Now, Walsh's theorem says that, for such a B, the set [formula] is contained in the hyperbolic convex hull of [formula], defined appropriately; see [\cite=W] for a precise statement.

It should be mentioned that the set [formula] in the Gauss-Lucas theorem is automatically - and trivially - nonempty, provided that [formula]. Similarly, in Walsh's theorem, we have [formula] whenever n, the degree of B, satisfies 2  ≤  n <   ∞  . To see why, assume that B' does not vanish on the set [formula] (otherwise the statement is trivial) and note that [formula]. The formula

[formula]

shows then that the (nonempty) set [formula] is symmetric with respect to the circle [formula], so precisely one half of its points must be in [formula].

Thus, the Gauss-Lucas and Walsh theorems actually assert the existence of critical points in the appropriate region and also describe their location; this last part roughly amounts to saying that the zeros of P' or B' are to be found not too far from those of P or B, respectively.

Our purpose is to elaborate on Walsh's theorem by moving from finite Blaschke products to infinite ones, as well as to generic inner functions, and still further - namely, to fairly general analytic self-maps of the disk - and to study similar (Gauss-Lucas type) phenomena in these cases.

At this point, we pause to recall some basic terminology and notation. A function θ in H∞ (i.e., a bounded holomorphic function on [formula]) is said to be inner if [formula] for m-almost all [formula]. Here and throughout, m is the normalized Lebesgue measure on the unit circle [formula], so that dm(ζ) = (2π)- 1|dζ|. It is well known that every inner function θ can be factored canonically as θ  =  λBS, where [formula] is a constant, B is a Blaschke product and S is a singular inner function; see [\cite=G]. More explicitly, the factors involved are of the form

[formula]

where [formula] is a sequence - possibly finite or empty - with [formula] (if zj = 0, one puts |zj| / zj =  - 1), and

[formula]

with μ a (nonnegative) singular measure on [formula]. The set [formula] is called the boundary spectrum of θ; we shall denote it by σ(θ). Equivalently, σ(θ) is the set of boundary singularities for θ, i.e., the smallest closed set [formula] such that θ is analytic across [formula].

Further, a zero-free holomorphic function F on [formula] is said to be outer if log |F| coincides with the harmonic extension (Poisson integral) of an integrable function on [formula]. When normalized by the condition F(0) > 0, an outer function F takes the form

[formula]

where h is a nonnegative function on [formula] with [formula]. This h actually agrees with the nontangential boundary values of |F| almost everywhere on [formula].

The functions f that admit a factorization of the form f = θF, with θ inner and F outer, are precisely those lying in the Smirnov class N+; see [\cite=G]. Alternatively, we can define (or characterize) N+ as the set of ratios u / v, where u,v∈H∞ and v is outer. When v is merely assumed to be zero-free on [formula], such ratios range over the Nevanlinna class N.

We write the canonical factorization of a function f∈N+, [formula], in the form

[formula]

the three factors on the right being [\eqref=eqn:infblaschke], [\eqref=eqn:singinner] and [\eqref=eqn:outer], respectively (and we take the liberty to ignore the unimodular constant factor involved). In particular, this canonical representation applies whenever f is in the Hardy space Hp with some p∈(0,  ∞  ] (see [\cite=G]); in fact, we have [formula].

Now, going back to Walsh's theorem and trying to adapt it to an infinite Blaschke product B (to begin with), we already have to face the new phenomenon that the set [formula] may be empty. Moreover, this may well happen for a Blaschke product B with B'∈N+. An example can be furnished as follows: fix a number [formula] and put

[formula]

where S is the atomic" singular inner function given by

[formula]

It is well known (and easy to verify) that [formula] is a Blaschke product. At the same time, differentiation yields

[formula]

and it is clear that the right-hand side is zero-free in [formula]. Furthermore, [formula] for every [formula], and the inner factor of [formula] is S.

On the other hand, given a nonconstant inner function θ with θ'∈N+, it turns out that θ' must have a nontrivial inner factor, unless θ is a Möbius transformation (see [\cite=DCMFT] or [\cite=DCR]). These observations seem to suggest that we modify our viewpoint appropriately. Namely, as long as our variations on Walsh's theme involving an inner function θ are supposed to deal with something a priori existent, rather than pertain to the theory of the empty set", we feel that we should look at [formula], the inner factor of θ', rather than at the zero set [formula]. (Here and below, we use the notation [formula] for the inner factor of a function f∈N+.) More precisely, we should try to understand the relationship between the (suitably defined) smallness set of [formula] and that of θ. In particular, it would be interesting to compare the boundary spectra [formula] and σ(θ), i.e., those parts of the unit circle [formula] where the two smallness sets hit it.

In fact, we are not going to restrict ourselves to inner functions, even though moving beyond this class makes things more complicated. This time, turning to a general function f∈H∞ with f'∈N+, we can no longer expect that f' will necessarily have an inner factor whenever f does. For instance, suppose that h is a holomorphic function on [formula], with [formula] bounded above, whose range [formula] contains infinitely many points of the form c + 2πik, where [formula] is fixed and k ranges over (a subset of) [formula]. The function f: = eh - ec(∈H∞) then vanishes at the points zk: = h- 1(c + 2πik); thus, f is divisible by an infinite Blaschke product, while f' = h'eh may well be outer. More sophisticated examples in this vein are given in Section 4 below.

At the same time, we single out a class of H∞-functions that does obey the Gauss-Lucas principle", or perhaps the Walsh principle", meaning that the property of being non-outer is inherited by f' from f and that the boundary spectra of the two inner factors, [formula] and [formula], are related appropriately. The class in question appears to be (almost) optimal.

Before stating the results, let us recall that a unit-norm function f∈H∞ is said to possess an angular derivative (in the sense of Carathéodory) at a point [formula] if both f and f' have nontangential limits at ζ and, once we agree to denote the two limits by f(ζ) and f'(ζ), the former of these satisfies |f(ζ)| = 1. The classical Julia-Carathéodory theorem (see [\cite=B], [\cite=Car] or [\cite=Sar2]) asserts that this happens if and only if

[formula]

Further, given a point [formula], we shall denote by ωz the harmonic measure associated with it. Thus dωz = Pzdm on [formula], where Pz stands for the corresponding Poisson kernel:

[formula]

The quantity [formula], where E is a (Lebesgue) measurable subset of [formula], can be roughly interpreted as the normalized angle at which E is seen from z.

Also, we need to recall that a Blaschke product B with zeros {zj} is said to be thin if

[formula]

a condition that can be rewritten in the form

[formula]

The sequence {zj} itself is then also called thin, whereas non-thin sequences (and the corresponding Blaschke products) will be termed thick. In the literature, one encounters thin (or thick) sequences in many places. In particular, they turn up in connection with maximal ideals in uniform algebras and with various interpolation problems. One of the first occurrences can be found in [\cite=Wo]; see also [\cite=DN] [\cite=GM] [\cite=SW].

Now suppose that E is a (Lebesgue) measurable subset of [formula], and

[formula]

(this notation will be used throughout), while f is an H∞-function with f'∈N+. Further, let [formula], where B is a Blaschke product and S a singular inner function. We shall denote by σE,f(B) the set of those points [formula] for which there exists a thick sequence [formula] with zn  →  ζ satisfying

[formula]

and

[formula]

Finally, we write [formula].

Let f∈H∞ be a nonconstant function with [formula], and let E be a measurable subset of [formula] such that f has an angular derivative almost everywhere on E. Suppose that each of the three factors in the canonical factorization [\eqref=eqn:canfact] has its derivative in N+ (whence also f'∈N+). Assume, finally, that [formula]. Then f' has a nontrivial inner factor, say J, with σ(J)  ⊃  σE(f).

The last inclusion should be compared with the fact that σ(J) is always contained in σ(f), the set of boundary singularities for f. Indeed, if f is analytic in a neighborhood of a point [formula], then so is f', and hence also its inner factor, J (see [\cite=G] in connection with the latter implication).

One may find it unfortunate that condition [\eqref=eqn:secondcond] involves f', instead of being stated in terms of f alone. We note, however, that it only depends on the boundary values of |f'| (or, equivalently, on the outer factor of f'), whereas the conclusion of Theorem [\ref=thm:newmainres] concerns the inner factor of f'. Moreover, under further hypotheses, we come up with simpler sufficient conditions that imply [\eqref=eqn:secondcond] - as well as [\eqref=eqn:firstcond] - leading to more transparent formulations.

First of all, conditions [\eqref=eqn:firstcond] and [\eqref=eqn:secondcond] are automatically fulfilled whenever ζ is an interior point of E and zn  →  ζ. Indeed, the Poisson kernels Pzn will then satisfy

[formula]

This makes [\eqref=eqn:firstcond] immediate, while [\eqref=eqn:secondcond] follows upon combining [\eqref=eqn:poikerabove] with the fact that [formula]. In particular, the two conditions obviously hold when [formula]; this corresponds to the case where f is inner (and with derivative in N+), a situation where the theorem takes a particularly simple form.

Now, for an inner function θ = BS with θ'∈N+, let us agree to write [formula] for [formula]. A point [formula] will thus be in [formula] if and only if either ζ∈σ(S) or ζ is the limit of some thick subsequence of [formula]. This said, the following corollaries of Theorem [\ref=thm:newmainres] come out readily.

Let f∈H∞ be a nonconstant function with [formula], and let E be a measurable subset of [formula] such that f has an angular derivative almost everywhere on E. Suppose that each of the three factors in the canonical factorization [\eqref=eqn:canfact] has its derivative in N+. Assume, finally, that [formula], while [formula] is contained in the interior of E (relative to [formula]). Then [formula] is a nontrivial inner function and [formula].

Let θ be a nonconstant inner function, other than a Möbius transformation, with θ'∈N+. Then [formula] is a nontrivial inner function and [formula].

When [formula], Corollary [\ref=cor:innthick] is a special case of the preceding assertion (just take [formula] and f = θ = BS). Otherwise, we are only concerned with the nontriviality of [formula], and this is guaranteed by the above-mentioned result from [\cite=DCMFT] [\cite=DCR].

Regarding the hypothesis θ'∈N+ (for θ inner), we recall that this is actually equivalent to θ'∈N. Furthermore, each of these holds if and only if [formula], where θ' is understood as the angular derivative. These results are due to Ahern and Clark; see [\cite=AC].

Another observation is as follows. Let θ and J be as in Corollary [\ref=cor:innthick]. If σ(θ) happens to coincide with [formula], then we may combine the conclusion of Corollary [\ref=cor:innthick] with the trivial inclusion σ(J)  ⊂  σ(θ) (recall the discussion following Theorem [\ref=thm:newmainres]) to deduce that

[formula]

The author does not know whether [\eqref=eqn:sieqsi] holds in general, the thickness assumption being removed.

Going back to generic (possibly non-inner) functions, we remark that conditions [\eqref=eqn:firstcond] and [\eqref=eqn:secondcond] will also hold for a boundary point ζ of E, provided that the zn's tend to ζ tangentially enough from the E side" (i.e., they should lie much closer to E than to [formula]). The next result, also a consequence of Theorem [\ref=thm:newmainres], contains a simple sufficient condition for this to happen, once E is taken to be an arc. In what follows, we write A for the disk algebra [formula].

Let E  =  {eit:  0  ≤  t  ≤  t0}, where 0 < t0  ≤  π, and let F∈H∞ be an outer function such that [formula], F'∈A, and |F| = 1 on E. Further, let [formula] be a thick sequence with the properties that [formula] ([formula]), lim n  →    ∞zn = 1 and

[formula]

Finally, assume that the Blaschke product B = B{zn} satisfies B'∈N+ and put f: = BF. Then f' lies in N+ and has a nontrivial inner factor, J, with 1∈σ(J).

A few remarks are in order. First, it is easy to construct an outer function F satisfying the hypotheses of Theorem [\ref=thm:arcad] by defining its modulus [formula] appropriately. Namely, it suffices to assume that [formula] for some ε > 0 (i.e., that h'' is Lipschitz continuous of order ε), in addition to the obvious conditions that [formula], [formula] on [formula], and [formula]. Now, for F = Oh, the fact that F'∈A (and actually the stronger conclusion that [formula]) is guaranteed by the Havin-Shamoyan(-Carleson-Jacobs) theorem; see [\cite=DActa] [\cite=H] [\cite=Shi]. In the case where h is strictly positive, the regularity assumption can be relaxed to [formula], since F = Oh will then be in the same class; this follows from standard properties of the Hilbert transform, see [\cite=G].

Secondly, condition [\eqref=eqn:angderbla] means precisely that B has an angular derivative at the point 1. Roughly speaking, it says that the zero sequence {zn} approaches its limit point 1 in a suitably tangential manner. The (sufficient) tangency condition expressed by [\eqref=eqn:angderbla] should be compared with the weaker condition [\eqref=eqn:firstcond], which, alone, does not suffice to conclude that [formula] is nontrivial; see Example 2 in Section 4 below.

Thirdly, we could have stated Theorem [\ref=thm:arcad] in a more general form, where a nontrivial singular factor S (with S'∈N+) is present in the canonical factorization [\eqref=eqn:canfact]. The conclusion would have been that [formula]. However, the main issue being the location of the zeros, we have chosen to restrict ourselves to the current version.

The proofs of Theorems [\ref=thm:newmainres] and [\ref=thm:arcad] are given in Sections 2 and 3, respectively, while the last section contains a couple of examples to the effect that the hypotheses of Theorem [\ref=thm:newmainres] are close to being sharp.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:newmainres]

First of all, since

[formula]

our hypotheses on the three factors guarantee that f'∈N+.

Furthermore, because [formula], we know that either [formula] or [formula]. Assuming that [formula] (so that the singular factor S is nontrivial), we now rewrite [\eqref=eqn:diffthree] as

[formula]

and claim that each of the three terms on the right is in N+. Indeed, for the last term, this is ensured by Ahern and Clark's result (see [\cite=AC]) which says that S' / S∈N+ whenever S'∈N+; the preceding terms present no difficulty. It follows that f' / S∈N+, and so [formula] is divisible by S. In particular, we have then [formula] and σ(S)  ⊂  σ(J).

To deal with the case where [formula], more work is needed. Let G stand for the outer factor of f', so that

[formula]

and let GE (resp., [formula]) be defined by a similar formula, where the integral is taken over E (resp., over [formula]). Thus, in particular, GE is the outer function with modulus [formula] and [formula].

Our plan is to deduce the nontriviality of the inner function J: = f' / G, plus the fact that σ(J) contains σE,f(B), from the inequality

[formula]

which will be established later on. Right now, we take it for granted and complete the proof.

Let ζ∈σE,f(B). By definition, this means that we can find a thick sequence [formula] with zn  →  ζ satisfying [\eqref=eqn:firstcond] and [\eqref=eqn:secondcond]. Let B0 be the Blaschke product with zeros {zn}, so that B0 is a subproduct of B and

[formula]

Also, we have f = gB0 for some g∈H∞ with [formula]; this in turn implies that

[formula]

for each n. Consequently, applying [\eqref=eqn:crucineq] with z = zn yields

[formula]

where

[formula]

Now, [\eqref=eqn:firstcond] shows that the quantity

[formula]

tends to 0 as n  →    ∞  , while [\eqref=eqn:secondcond] leads us to a similar conclusion about the quantity

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

Finally, taking [\eqref=eqn:liminfbla] and [\eqref=eqn:limgag] into account, we deduce from [\eqref=eqn:applcru] that

[formula]

Recalling that [formula], we readily conclude that ζ∈σ(J), whence in particular [formula].

It remains to verify [\eqref=eqn:crucineq]. Let [formula] be fixed. Then, for almost all ζ∈E, Julia's lemma (see [\cite=G]) gives

[formula]

or equivalently,

[formula]

(recall that |f(ζ)| = 1 whenever f has an angular derivative at ζ). Next, we consider the H∞-function

[formula]

and rewrite [\eqref=eqn:juliabis] in the form

[formula]

Further, we define Ψz to be the outer function with modulus

[formula]

and observe that

[formula]

In fact, for ζ∈E, this inequality coincides with [\eqref=eqn:estone], while for [formula] the two sides are obviously equal.

Since Ψz is outer, the estimate [\eqref=eqn:estoncirc] extends into [formula], so that

[formula]

In particular, this holds for w = z, whence

[formula]

A glance at [\eqref=eqn:fzphi] reveals that

[formula]

and we take further steps to estimate |Ψz(z)|.

We have

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

The arithmetic/geometric mean inequality yields

[formula]

We proceed by noticing that, for almost all [formula],

[formula]

where

[formula]

Also, we introduce the (harmonic) function

[formula]

and go on to observe that

[formula]

(This follows from [\eqref=eqn:fzze] and the fact that [formula] on [formula].) Consequently,

[formula]

Plugging the resulting inequality from [\eqref=eqn:taburetka] into [\eqref=eqn:conc], we now get

[formula]

This done, we combine [\eqref=eqn:righthand] with [\eqref=eqn:int1] and [\eqref=eqn:int2fin] to infer that

[formula]

and hence

[formula]

Since

[formula]

we may further rewrite [\eqref=eqn:unitaz] as

[formula]

On the other hand, recalling [\eqref=eqn:estatz] and [\eqref=eqn:lefthand], we see that

[formula]

Finally, a juxtaposition of [\eqref=eqn:unitazbis] and [\eqref=eqn:unitaztri] yields

[formula]

which is precisely [\eqref=eqn:crucineq]. The proof is therefore complete.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:arcad]

It suffices to check that the hypotheses of the current theorem imply those of Theorem [\ref=thm:newmainres], with [formula], and that σE(f) = {1}. An application of Theorem [\ref=thm:newmainres] will then do the job.

First of all, the assumptions on B and F guarantee that f = BF possesses an angular derivative everywhere on E  =  {eit:  0  ≤  t  ≤  t0}. Indeed, each of the two factors enjoys a similar property there; in particular, [\eqref=eqn:angderbla] tells us that B has an angular derivative at the endpoint 1. This said, it remains to verify conditions [\eqref=eqn:firstcond] and [\eqref=eqn:secondcond], where [formula] is the arc complementary to E.

The verification of [\eqref=eqn:firstcond] is straightforward. In fact, from [\eqref=eqn:angderbla] it clearly follows that

[formula]

It is also obvious that

[formula]

Consequently, the product of the two quantities, which is

[formula]

also tends to 0 as n  →    ∞  . Together with the elementary estimate

[formula]

this yields [\eqref=eqn:firstcond].

Here and below, the sign [formula] is used to mean that the quantities involved are comparable (i.e., their ratio lies between two positive constants).

To check [\eqref=eqn:secondcond], we are going to prove the following claim: There exist numbers C > 1 and [formula] such that

[formula]

Once this is established, [\eqref=eqn:secondcond] comes out easily. Indeed, on the arc

[formula]

we have - M  ≤   log |f'|  ≤  M with M: =  log C, whence

[formula]

Now, for [formula], we have

[formula]

(because the limit point 1 of the zn's lies at a positive distance from [formula]), and so

[formula]

Combining [\eqref=eqn:firstest] and [\eqref=eqn:secondest], we arrive at [\eqref=eqn:secondcond].

We now turn to proving the claim above; see [\eqref=eqn:zhaba] and the italicized text preceding it. Since f' = B'F + BF', the right-hand inequality in [\eqref=eqn:zhaba] will be established as soon as we show that |B'(eit)| is bounded for [formula]. To this end, we write zn = rneiφn (with rn > 0 and 0 < φn  <  π) and estimate the quantity

[formula]

at a point ζ = eit with [formula]. There is no loss of generality in assuming that [formula] and [formula], since this is true for all but finitely many zn's. We now combine the elementary inequalities

[formula]

valid in this case, with the fact that

[formula]

to infer that

[formula]

The last quantity being finite by [\eqref=eqn:angderbla], it follows that |B'(eit)| is bounded for [formula]. Consequently,

[formula]

which proves half" of [\eqref=eqn:zhaba].

Moving on to the left-hand inequality in [\eqref=eqn:zhaba], we first note that the modulus of the (angular) derivative F'(ζ) at a point ζ∈E coincides with the nontangential limit of

[formula]

as z  →  ζ; this forms part of the Julia-Carathéodory theorem. Secondly, we recall that

[formula]

a well-known consequence of Schwarz's lemma (see, e.g., [\cite=Sar1]). Therefore,

[formula]

Now let [formula] be a number such that

[formula]

and let B0 and B1 be the Blaschke products with zero sets {zn:  1  ≤  n  ≤  N} and {zn:  n > N}, respectively. Then put G: = FB0, so that f = GB1.

Since F and B0 both have an angular derivative on E, the same is true for G. Moreover, it follows (see [\cite=AC]) that

[formula]

Recalling [\eqref=eqn:feta], we see that |G'|  ≥  |F'|  ≥  η on E; and since G'( = F'B0 + FB'0) is continuous on [formula], we can find a number [formula] such that

[formula]

(here [formula] is the arc defined by [\eqref=eqn:gade]). Furthermore, because [formula] on [formula], we have

[formula]

there; in particular, this holds on [formula].

Finally, we estimate the quantity

[formula]

at a point ζ = eit with [formula]. As before, we write zn = rneiφn, assuming that [formula] and [formula] (this is certainly true for n > N, with N large enough), and we employ the elementary inequalities [\eqref=eqn:elemineq] and [\eqref=eqn:elemineqbis] to estimate the sum in [\eqref=eqn:bone]. The estimate, which mimics [\eqref=eqn:abracadabra], reads

[formula]

where the last step relies on [\eqref=eqn:choiceofn]. Eventually, we obtain

[formula]

(we have actually checked this for the bigger arc [formula], not just for [formula]). Finally, we combine [\eqref=eqn:fprimebelow] with [\eqref=eqn:gongade] and [\eqref=eqn:bprimeeta] to conclude that

[formula]

This yields the left-hand side inequality in [\eqref=eqn:zhaba], with the appropriate C, and completes the proof.

Two examples

The purpose of this section is to show that conditions [\eqref=eqn:firstcond] and [\eqref=eqn:secondcond] appearing in Theorem [\ref=thm:newmainres], via the definition of σE(f), are indispensable and close to being sharp.

The two examples below follow the same pattern (and many more relevant examples can be furnished along these lines). Let [formula] be a conformal mapping of the disk onto a domain Ω that is contained in the left half-plane

[formula]

and contains, for some fixed number c, infinitely many points of the form c + 2πik with [formula]. More precisely, we are assuming that there is a c∈H and an infinite subset Λ of [formula] such that

[formula]

(This is certainly the case if Ω contains a vertical line or half-line.) Further, put a: = ec and note that |a| < 1; then define

[formula]

Since [formula], it follows that g (and hence also f) is an H∞-function of norm at most 1. Now, suppose that h maps a certain arc [formula] continuously onto an interval - possibly infinite - of the imaginary axis [formula]. We have then |g| = |f| = 1 on Γ (whence [formula]), and moreover, g and f will each have an angular derivative on Γ. In addition, f vanishes at the points zk: = h- 1(c + 2πik) with k∈Λ, because g(zk) = a. Consequently, letting B denote the Blaschke product with zeros zk, k∈Λ, we see that the inner part of f is divisible by B.

On the other hand,

[formula]

The function (1 - āg)- 2 is outer (and even invertible in H∞); therefore, if g and h' also happen to be outer, the same will be true for f'. The situation then stands in sharp contrast to the conclusion of Theorem [\ref=thm:newmainres]: indeed, f has a nonconstant inner factor, while f' has none. This means that the current function f violates the hypotheses of the theorem. Specifically, if E is taken to be Γ (so that [formula]) and if the zero sequence {zk} is thick, then either [\eqref=eqn:firstcond] or [\eqref=eqn:secondcond] must break down. Thus, a glance at a concrete example of the above type might reveal whether the two sufficient conditions are reasonably close to being necessary.

Example 1. Let

[formula]

The function

[formula]

(where the principal branch of the logarithm is used) maps [formula] conformally onto Ω. We now fix a number c with -  π < c < 0, then put a = ec and define the functions g and f by [\eqref=eqn:violin], with the current h plugged in. Letting E stand for the arc {eit: - π < t < 0}, we have [formula], and so f has an angular derivative on E. Since [formula] on [formula], it follows that g is outer. The function h'(z) = 2i(1 - z2)- 1 being outer as well, we may invoke [\eqref=eqn:viola] to deduce that f' is outer.

Now, the zeros zk of f, given by

[formula]

have the property that [formula] takes the constant value |c| / π. (This is best seen by looking at the images ζk of the zk's under the transformation

[formula]

which maps [formula] onto the right half-plane and E onto the half-line [formula]. The points ζk = (1 + zk) / (1 - zk) are then determined by the formula

[formula]

whence

[formula]

Recalling the well-known interpretation of the harmonic measure in terms of angles, one readily arrives at the required fact.)

Finally, we observe that the sequence {zk} clusters at the points [formula] and is thick. The latter claim can be verified with the help of a lemma by Sundberg and Wolff from [\cite=SW]. (Precisely speaking, the version we need is obtained by combining Lemma 7.1 on p. 578 of [\cite=SW] with the concluding paragraph on p. 580 after the lemma's proof. In fact, [\cite=SW] treats a more general situation involving a Douglas algebra B, which we take to be H∞ + C. See also [\cite=DN] for the special case in question.) To state the thinness criterion given there, let {aj} be a sequence of distinct points in [formula]. Also, consider the arcs

[formula]

with N > 1, and write K(N,j) for the set of those indices k, k  ≠  j, which satisfy ak / |ak|∈IN,j and 1 - |ak|  ≤  m(IN,j). This done, the Sundberg-Wolff result tells us that {aj} is thin if and only if, for every N > 1,

[formula]

Now, a computation shows that setting aj = zj, where the zj's are given by [\eqref=eqn:zedk], makes [\eqref=eqn:suwo] false (provided that N is large enough). Again, the easiest way to check this is to rephrase [\eqref=eqn:suwo] for the right half-plane and then look at the images [\eqref=eqn:zetak] of the zk's under the conformal mapping [\eqref=eqn:cmdhp]. Thus, {zk} is indeed a thick sequence.

In summary, while a suitably tangential convergence (in the sense of [\eqref=eqn:firstcond] and [\eqref=eqn:secondcond]) of the zero sequence {zk} to the endpoints [formula] of E would imply that f' has an inner factor, no kind of nontangential convergence would suffice. In fact, [\eqref=eqn:anglezetak] shows that, letting c be appropriately small in modulus, we can arrange it for the ζk's to lie on a half-line that forms an arbitrarily small angle with the lower imaginary semiaxis (or, equivalently, for zk to lie on a circular arc that forms an arbitrarily small angle with E at [formula]).

Example 2. Now let

[formula]

This time, we take the conformal map [formula] to be

[formula]

where the square root is supposed to satisfy [formula] for x > 0. We then fix a number c∈( -   ∞  ,0) and define the functions g and f by [\eqref=eqn:violin], with a = ec.

This done, we claim that g is an outer function. Indeed, since g is zero-free and has radial limit 0 only at the point 1, it follows that g has no inner factor, except possibly for the atomic" singular function

[formula]

with some γ > 0. However, if g were divisible by [formula], then we would have

[formula]

whereas g actually has a milder decay rate as [formula]; in fact,

[formula]

Thus, g is outer. So is the function

[formula]

and we eventually conclude, by virtue of [\eqref=eqn:viola], that f' is outer also.

The semicircle {eit:0 < t < π} = :E is mapped by h onto the half-line [formula], so f has an angular derivative on E. (Note that the current E is different from its namesake in Example 1.) Finally, the zeros zk of f are now given by

[formula]

Equivalently, the points ζk = (1 + zk) / (1 - zk) (i.e., the images of the zk's in the right half-plane under the transformation [\eqref=eqn:cmdhp]) are determined by

[formula]

We have [formula] and

[formula]

To verify [\eqref=eqn:compar], one may first rewrite [\eqref=eqn:gandon] in the form

[formula]

where

[formula]

Now, the image of [formula] under the map [\eqref=eqn:cmdhp] is [formula], and the angle at which this half-line is seen from ζk is comparable to its tangent, ξk  /  ηk (or equivalently, to 1 / k). Moving back to the disk, one arrives at [\eqref=eqn:compar]. Furthermore, a calculation shows that

[formula]

Together with [\eqref=eqn:compar], this ensures that

[formula]

making [\eqref=eqn:firstcond] true. By contrast, [\eqref=eqn:secondcond] breaks down, the reason being that |f'| becomes too small near the endpoint 1 of [formula].

The conclusion is that condition [\eqref=eqn:firstcond] alone, or even its stronger version

[formula]

is not enough to guarantee the validity of our Gauss-Lucas type phenomenon (i.e., to ensure that f' has a nontrivial inner factor whenever f does). A different type of tangency condition, stated in terms of |f'|, should be added to make things work.

Finally, we remark that the sequence {zk} in this last example was thick. This, again, can be verified by means of the Sundberg-Wolff criterion [\eqref=eqn:suwo], possibly transplanting everything to the right half-plane (for the sake of convenience) and working with the ζk's instead.
