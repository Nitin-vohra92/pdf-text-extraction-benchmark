Introduction

Young pulsars represent the majority of the high-energy gamma-ray sources identified in our Galaxy [\citep=2013ApJS..208...17A]. In spite of exquisite data, the origin of the gamma-ray emission remains poorly understood. The high-energy gamma rays are often associated with curvature radiation, emitted by relativistic electron-positron pairs accelerated in tiny regions where the electric field is not perfectly screened by the plasma (the so-called "gap" models, e.g., [\citealt=1983ApJ...266..215A] [\citealt=1986ApJ...300..500C] [\citealt=1996ApJ...470..469R] [\citealt=2003ApJ...588..430M]). In this framework, particle acceleration and emission are confined within the corotating magnetosphere delimited by the light cylinder of radius RLC = Pc / 2π, where P is the spin period of the star and c is the speed of light.

There has been significant progress in the numerical modeling of pulsar magnetospheres, mostly in the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) limit (force-free, resistive force-free, and full MHD, see e.g., [\citealt=1999ApJ...511..351C] [\citealt=2005PhRvL..94b1101G] [\citealt=2006MNRAS.367...19K] [\citealt=2006ApJ...648L..51S] [\citealt=2006MNRAS.368L..30M] [\citealt=2006MNRAS.368.1055T] [\citealt=2009A&A...496..495K] [\citealt=2010ApJ...715.1282B] [\citealt=2012ApJ...749....2K] [\citealt=2012MNRAS.424..605P] [\citealt=2012MNRAS.423.1416P] [\citealt=2012ApJ...746...60L] [\citealt=2013MNRAS.435L...1T]), and most recently using particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations [\citep=2014ApJ...785L..33P] [\citep=2014ApJ...795L..22C]. A prominent feature found in these simulations is the presence of strong current sheets in the magnetosphere. One current sheet forms near the star in each hemisphere at the boundary between the open and the closed field lines (or separatrix). Both sheets merge at the end of the closed zone near the light-cylinder radius (at the "Y-point"), and create a single current layer which supports open magnetic field lines. [\citet=1990ApJ...349..538C] proposed that dissipation in the current sheet via relativistic reconnection could account for the efficient transfer of magnetic flux into energetic particles (i.e., the "sigma-problem"). [\citet=1996A&A...311..172L] pointed out that the observed pulsed gamma-ray emission could be a natural outcome of such a process. In this scenario, particles are accelerated in the current sheet and radiate synchrotron gamma-ray photons [\citep=2002A&A...388L..29K] [\citep=2012MNRAS.424.2023P] [\citep=2013A&A...550A.101A] [\citep=2014ApJ...780....3U].

PIC simulations of isolated current sheets show that relativistic reconnection in collisionless pair plasmas is fast and efficient at accelerating particles (e.g., [\citealt=2001ApJ...562L..63Z] [\citealt=2004PhPl...11.1151J] [\citealt=2014ApJ...782..104C] [\citealt=2014ApJ...783L..21S] [\citealt=2014PhRvL.113o5005G] [\citealt=2014arXiv1409.8262W]). However, there are important differences between these local simulations and the global structure of the current sheet in pulsars (e.g., geometrical effects, gradients, strong electric field induced by the rotation of the star, absorption/creation of particles), so the results might not be directly applicable. The first kinetic simulations of the aligned pulsar show that the current layers are indeed involved in particle acceleration [\citep=2014ApJ...785L..33P] [\citep=2014ApJ...795L..22C], but the details of the acceleration mechanism remains unclear.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of particle acceleration in the aligned pulsar magnetosphere using large, high-resolution two-dimensional (2D) axisymmetric PIC simulations. In addition, this work explores the effect of the plasma supply and magnetization on the global structure of the magnetosphere, and on the pulsar spin-down power. This article is organized as follows. In Sect. [\ref=setup] we describe the implementation of the 2D spherical axisymmetric grid in the Zeltron code. Most of the technical details are given in the appendices (Appendix [\ref=app_maxwell], [\ref=app_deposit]). We describe how the simulation is set up, with a particular emphasis on the boundary conditions. In Sect. [\ref=results] we present the main results of this study, which are summarized in Sect. [\ref=conclusions].

Numerical tools and setup

The Zeltron code in spherical coordinates

In this study, we use the explicit, massively parallel, electromagnetic PIC code Zeltron, initially developed for relativistic reconnection studies [\citep=2013ApJ...770..147C] [\citep=2014ApJ...782..104C]. The code employs the standard second-order accurate Yee algorithm [\citep=1966ITAP...14..302Y] to advance the electromagnetic field in time, and the second-order accurate Boris [\citep=1991ppcs.book.....B] or [\citet=2008PhPl...15e6701V] algorithms to solve the equation of motion of the particles. Zeltron does not follow a strictly charge-conserving scheme, instead small errors accumulated in the electric field are corrected periodically by solving Poisson's equation [\citep=2003LNP...615....1P]. To perform simulations of the aligned pulsar, we implemented a 2D axisymmetric spherical grid in Zeltron (see also the recent developments by [\citealt=2014ApJ...795L..22C] and [\citealt=2015NewA...36...37B]). Maxwell's equations are discretized and solved on the spherical Yee mesh, using the formulae given in Appendix [\ref=app_maxwell], while the particles' equations of motion are solved in Cartesian coordinates. The positions and velocities of the particles are then remapped onto the spherical grid where their charges and currents are deposited using the volume weighting technique (bilinear interpolation in r3 and cos θ) given in Appendix [\ref=app_deposit]. As discussed below, using spherical coordinates greatly simplifies the formulation of the boundary conditions.

The grid

The computational domain extends in radius from the surface of the star, i.e., [formula], up to r = r max = 6.67RLC, and from [formula] to [formula] (see Fig. [\ref=fig_setup]). The light-cylinder radius is set at [formula]. The spin axis of the star is aligned along [formula]. The grid points are uniformly spaced in log 10r and θ. The log-spherical grid presents three advantages here: (1) the regions close to the star where the fields are most intense have the highest resolution, (2) the box can be radially extended to large distances at reduced computational costs, and (3) it preserves the cells' aspect ratio. We found that the parallelization of the code for this problem is most optimized if the domain is decomposed along the θ-direction, because the vast majority of particles drift along quasi-radial field lines.

The fields

The simulations start in vacuum with a magnetic dipole frozen into the surface of a perfectly conducting neutron star, and aligned along the rotation axis ([formula], Fig. [\ref=fig_setup]), such that [formula], where Ω is the angular velocity of the star. Hence, the three components of the magnetic field are

[formula]

At t = 0, the star is instantly spun up to its angular velocity Ω by imposing, on the surface of the star, the poloidal electric field induced by the rotation of the field lines

[formula]

where R = r sin θ is the cylindrical radius, and where [formula] is the unit vector in the θ-directions. The toroidal electric field at the surface of the star is set to [formula] at all times.

The choice of the outer boundary condition for the fields is more involved. To mimic an open boundary in which no information is able to come back inward, we define an absorbing layer starting at r = rabs and extending to the end of the box, where Maxwell's equations contain an electric and a magnetic conductivity terms (see red shaded region in Fig. [\ref=fig_setup]), such that [\citep=1991ppcs.book.....B]

[formula]

One can avoid undesirable reflections of waves at r = rabs by gradually increasing the conductivities with distance. Empirically, we found that the following conductivity profile is a good damping layer,

[formula]

[formula]

where Δt is the time step (see its definition in Appendix [\ref=app_maxwell]), and Kabs > 1 is a numerical parameter that controls the damping strength. Here, we choose Kabs = 40. At r = r max, we apply a zero gradient condition on the fields, i.e., [formula] and [formula]. The absorbing layer is set at rabs = 0.9r max in all the simulations presented here.

Thanks to the integral form of Maxwell's equations derived in Appendix [\ref=app_maxwell], we are able to push the θ-boundaries to the axis (there is no division by sin θ). Then one can simply apply the axial symmetry to the fields at θ = 0 and θ  =  π: Eθ,φ = 0, ~ Bθ,φ = 0 and ∂Er  /  ∂θ = 0, ~ ∂Br  /  ∂θ = 0.

The particles

In principle, one should model the full electromagnetic cascade to obtain a self-consistent injection of pairs into the magnetosphere (e.g., [\citealt=2013MNRAS.429...20T] [\citealt=2014ApJ...795L..22C]). Instead of solving for the cascade, we propose a simple and robust way to fill the magnetosphere with plasma. This method consists of injecting a neutral plasma of pairs at every time step uniformly between the surface of the neutron star [formula] and [formula], where Δr is the thickness of the first row of cell along the r-direction, and with no angular dependence. The particles are injected along the field lines with a poloidal velocity, vpol = 0.5c, and in corotation with the star, i.e., with vφ = RΩ. The flux of particles injected at every time step is

[formula]

where [formula] is the Goldreich-Julian density [\citep=1969ApJ...157..869G] at the pole of the star. This configuration mimics the injection of fresh plasma by the cascade everywhere close to the star. The efficiency of the cascade is parametrized by the injection rate finj. Even though the injection rate of particles per time step is fixed, the plasma density at the surface of the star is free to vary with time and θ, depending on the amount of plasma trapped near the surface and the number of particles returning back to the star. However, to avoid over-injecting into the closed zone where the plasma is trapped, the code adds new pairs only if the plasma at the surface of the star is well magnetized. Plasma magnetization is quantified by the σ-parameter, defined here as

[formula]

where (n+ + n-) is the total plasma density, and Γ is the plasma bulk Lorentz factor. We define a minimum value for σ at the surface of the star, [formula], below which no pairs are injected.

To model the special case of a "dead" pulsar where there is no pair production, i.e., the "electrosphere" or the "disk-dome" solution (see review by [\citealt=1999PhR...318..227M]), we used a slightly different method. In this case, the amount of new injected charges is controlled by the surface charge density, Σ, given by the jump condition

[formula]

where [formula] is the radial electric field at the surface of the star, while [formula] is the radial corotating electric field at [formula]. If Σ < 0 (Σ > 0), only electrons (positrons) are injected with the appropriate density, and without any initial velocity along the field lines, i.e., vpol = 0. In practice, we release only a fraction of Σ (a few percent) every time step, to avoid over-injection. The code stops injecting new particles when the density of charge reaches the Goldreich-Julian charge density, [formula].

Regardless of the injection method, any particle that strikes the [formula] boundary is removed from the simulation. The same fate applies to any particle leaving the working domain into the absorbing layer, i.e., if r  ≥  rabs. Our results are unchanged if the particles are removed further out, at r = r max. On the axis, particles are reflected with no loss of energy.

Physical and numerical parameters

We perform a series of simulations in which we vary the plasma injection rate finj, and the minimum plasma magnetization parameter defined at the star's surface, [formula]. In the first set we keep [formula] fixed, and study the transition between a charge-starved magnetosphere for finj  ≪  1 where pair production is inefficient, to a force-free magnetosphere filled with a dense plasma for finj = 1 where [formula] everywhere (except in the current sheet). The force-free regime is appropriate to describe young gamma-ray pulsars which are characterized by intense surface magnetic fields, [formula]G, and very large plasma multiplicities κ  ≫  1. The multiplicity is defined as the ratio between the plasma density and the local Goldreich-Julian plasma density [formula]. Fig. [\ref=fig_multiplicity] shows the actual local plasma multiplicities achieved in each simulation at the poles and at the Y-point, as a function of finj. The multiplicity increases approximatively linearly with finj. Notice the significant difference in multiplicity between the poles and the Y-point. The multiplicity also increases linearly with the initial kick velocity given to the particles, here fixed at vpol = 0.5c. We reproduce the disk-dome solution using the prescription given in Sect. [\ref=sect_inj]. In a second set of simulations, the plasma injection rate is fixed at finj = 1 and [formula] varies from 500, ~ 1000, ~ 2000 to 5000. The purpose of this exploration is to study the effect of the magnetization on particle acceleration in the magnetosphere (Sect. [\ref=sect_acc]).

In real pulsars, there is a huge separation of scales between the plasma skin-depth, de, the radius of the star and the light-cylinder radius, which cannot be reproduced in the simulations. However, it is possible to scale the problem down by decreasing the gap between these scales, and still keep the same hierarchy of scales, i.e., [formula]. In the runs with finj = 1, we have [formula] and [formula]. Our fiducial simulation is composed of 1024 cells in r and in θ, which gives a spatial resolution at the surface of the star of de  /  Δr  ≈  5 for finj = 0.1 down to de  /  Δr  ≈  0.5 for finj = 1. The plasma frequency is well resolved in all runs, with Δt  ≤  0.28ω- 1p. Note that these estimates apply for non-relativistic particles, with a Lorentz factor γ = 1. In reality γ  ≫  1 everywhere in the magnetosphere; hence all plasma scales are very well resolved. Each simulation ran for about 4 spin periods, which is sufficient to establish a quasi-steady state everywhere, even in the outer parts of the box. The number of particles per cell injected at every time step (at the inner boundary) is set at 8 (4 per species). Note that, once the magnetosphere is established the actual number of particles per cell is typically of order 50. We checked that our results are numerically converged by increasing the number of grid cells to 20482, and by varying the number of injected particles per boundary cell from 2 to 32.

results

Establishment of the magnetosphere

All the simulations begin with the launch from the stellar surface of a torsional spherical Alfvén wave, that propagates outward at nearly the speed of light. This wave distributes the poloidal electric field throughout the box and sets the magnetosphere in rotation. The magnetosphere settles quickly into a quasi-steady state behind the wave. The initial transient stage ends when the wave is absorbed by the damping layer. Fig. [\ref=fig_magnetosphere] presents (from top to bottom) the structures of the toroidal magnetic field, the radial current densities, the relativistic invariant [formula] and the regions where [formula], for finj = 1 at t = 4P (left), and finj = 0.2 at t = 3P (right). Fig. [\ref=fig_density] shows the corresponding electron (top) and positron (bottom) densities.

In the case where the magnetosphere is fed with a large amount of plasma (finj = 0.5, ~ 1, and κ  >  1 at the poles, see left column of Figs. [\ref=fig_magnetosphere], [\ref=fig_density]), the solution is close to force-free (e.g., [\citealt=1999ApJ...511..351C]) with [formula] almost everywhere, except in the current layers where the force-free approximation breaks down ([formula] and [formula], see bottom-left panel in Fig. [\ref=fig_magnetosphere]). The current sheet forms self-consistently in the equator and supports open magnetic field lines beyond the light-cylinder radius. After about one rotation period, and before the flow reaches the absorbing layer, the current sheet becomes unstable and starts flapping around the equator in the θ-direction at [formula] (see also [\citealt=2014ApJ...785L..33P]). The amplitude of the kink increases roughly linearly with distance as the wind expands. At r   ≫   RLC and away from the current sheet, the magnetic field structure asymptotically approaches the split monopole solution [\citep=1973ApJ...180L.133M], where [formula] and [formula]. Both the toroidal and the poloidal magnetic fields reverse across the current layer, supported respectively by the radial and the toroidal currents. The current returns back into the star via the polar caps (middle panel in Fig. [\ref=fig_magnetosphere]). The plasma is not perfectly neutral: the polar regions are negatively charged, while the current sheet is positively charged. As shown below, the current is not only sustained by moving charged plasma but also by the counter-streaming of both species, in particular in the current sheets (see Sect. [\ref=sect_bulk]).

The structure of the magnetosphere in the low-density regime (finj = 0.1, ~ 0.2, and κ  <  1 at the poles, see right column of Figs. [\ref=fig_magnetosphere], [\ref=fig_density]) changes significantly. The force-free description is not valid anymore ([formula], bottom-right panel in Fig. [\ref=fig_magnetosphere]), and large vacuum gaps (regions with almost no plasma) open between the polar regions and the equator. The magnetosphere is almost perfectly charge-separated, with electrons at the poles and positrons at the equator. Notice that particles cross field lines in the equator (in particular near the light-cylinder), because E > B in this region. There is still an electric current flowing through the magnetosphere, but with lower intensity, which explains why fewer magnetic field lines open. The current layer forms a wedge with an opening angle ~  10o for finj = 0.2 and, in contrast with the high-multiplicity solution, it remains perfectly stable throughout the simulation. In this regime, the current does not form sharps arcs along the separatrices as in the high-multiplicity case. There is no clear Y-point either. Instead, the outflowing current is more diffuse and connect smoothly with the equatorial current layer beyond the light cylinder. This solution resembles the electrostatically supported current layer model recently proposed by [\citet=2014ApJ...781...46C].

In the extreme case where there is no pair production, we find that the solution reaches the disk-dome configuration, in agreement with previous studies [\citep=1985A&A...144...72K] [\citep=2001MNRAS.322..209S] [\citep=2002A&A...384..414P] [\citep=2002ASPC..271...81S] [\citep=2014ApJ...785L..33P]. This solution consists of a purely electrostatic structure with trapped positrons around the equator and trapped electrons at the poles, with no outflows or electric currents (see Fig. [\ref=fig_electrosphere]).

Fig. [\ref=fig_spindown] presents the total outgoing Poynting flux integrated over a sphere of radius r, or luminosity, as a function of radius, L(r). The energy flux at the light cylinder increases with the plasma injection rate and saturates for finj  ≥  0.5 to the spin-down power of an aligned rotator, i.e., [formula], in agreement with previous works in the force-free regime (e.g., [\citealt=1999ApJ...511..351C] [\citealt=2005PhRvL..94b1101G] [\citealt=2006ApJ...648L..51S] [\citealt=2012MNRAS.423.1416P] [\citealt=2014ApJ...785L..33P]). The disk-dome solution does not spin down, as expected. An important result is the large dissipation of the Poynting flux with distance, even in the high-multiplicity solution. At r = 5RLC, the flux decreases by about 30% for finj  ≥  0.5. In fact, half of the dissipation occurs between r = RLC and r = 2RLC. This result is robust against the number of particles per cell and resolution. In addition, we did not find a clear dependence with the ratio [formula], but we prefer not to draw any conclusion as the range explored here, from [formula] to 0.5, is rather modest. [\citet=2014ApJ...785L..33P] also reported the same amount of dissipation at r = 2RLC (a 15% drop). As shown in Sect. [\ref=sect_acc], the dissipated energy is efficiently channeled into energetic particles within the sheet. When the plasma supply in the magnetosphere decreases, the dissipation rate increases to about 40% for finj = 0.2, and to about 50% for finj = 0.1. Interestingly, we notice that the finj = 0.2 solution gives the same dissipation rate and spin-down power (≈  0.82L0) as found by [\citet=2014ApJ...781...46C]. It is also close to the spin-down power reported by [\citet=2014ApJ...795L..22C] if copious pair creation occurs in the current sheet (their "type I" solution).

Bulk motions

With these simulations, we are able to measure the relative motion between the two species in the magnetosphere and see how this contributes to the total current density. For this purpose, we reconstruct the fluid velocity vector, [formula], from the motion of individual particles averaged in every grid cell. In relativistic kinetic theory, one defines the fluid velocity vector as

[formula]

where [formula] is the particle momentum, E  =  γmec2 is the total particle energy, and [formula] is the particle distribution function.

Fig. [\ref=fig_bulk] shows the fluid velocity maps of each component, for both positrons (left panels) and electrons (right panels) in the inner magnetosphere at time t = 4P, where finj = 1 and [formula]. In the radial direction (top panel), both the electrons and positrons fly outward along the open field lines almost everywhere with a velocity of order Vr / c  ≈   + 0.8 - 0.9 at r  ≈  RLC and increasing with radius, with the notable exceptions of the polar regions and in the current sheets. This radial motion is due to the [formula] drift. At the poles, electrons and positrons both fly away from the star but at different velocities. Electrons move at Vr / c  ≈   + 0.8 while positrons move at about Vr / c  ≈   + 0.1 only. Hence, in addition to the net negative charge density at the poles, this difference in velocity between the two species also contributes to the negative radial current shown in Fig. [\ref=fig_magnetosphere], middle panels.

In the current sheet, we discover that the two species counter-propagate with very high speeds: positrons are ejected outward at + 0.6c, while electrons precipitate back towards the star at about - 0.6c (appearing as a bright blue beam in Fig. [\ref=fig_bulk], top right panel). As discussed below, this result has important consequences for particle acceleration and radiation. The Vθ-component does not show significant differences between electrons and positrons. Both species have mildly relativistic (≈  0.5c) drift velocities from the open field lines towards the current sheets, the highest speeds being closest to the sheet. These converging flows maintain and feed the current sheets with fresh plasma. They do not appear in the split-monopole model (e.g., [\citealt=1973ApJ...180L.133M]), because they are caused by reconnection in the equatorial layer which is captured by the simulations (see also [\citealt=2013MNRAS.435L...1T]). The fluid velocity along the φ-direction highlights the fast rotation about the axis of the plasma in the current sheet.

By combining all these data together, we infer the bulk Lorentz factor of the wind, [formula]. Fig. [\ref=fig_wind] presents the variations of Γ as a function of the cylindrical radius (R = r sin θ), averaged along the z-direction (where z = r cos θ). This figure also compares the Lorentz factor of the wind with the Lorentz factor of a particle moving at the [formula] drift velocity, Γdrift (red dashed line in Fig. [\ref=fig_wind]). The wind starts with Γ  ≈  1.6 which depends on the initial velocity of the injected particles. Then, Γ increases slowly with distance until it coincides with the [formula] drift Lorentz factor at R  ≈  2.5RLC. At this point, the wind Lorentz factor follows almost exactly the linear increase of Γdrift with distance, in agreement with previous works [\citep=1977MNRAS.180..125B] [\citep=2002ApJ...566..336C] [\citep=2006MNRAS.367...19K] [\citep=2006MNRAS.368.1717B]. We note that Γdrift follows perfectly the [formula] solution found by [\citet=2002ApJ...566..336C] within the light cylinder (dotted line in Fig. [\ref=fig_wind]). Our solution deviates from this analytical expression in the region [formula], but it tends back to the expected linear increase of Γ with R further out. At the outer edge of the box (R = 4.5RLC), the wind Lorentz factor reaches about Γ  ≈  3.5. In principle, the wind should accelerate up to the fast magnetosonic point, beyond which the wind Lorentz factor should saturate due to the dominant inertia of the plasma, but our box is too small to observe this transition.

Particle acceleration

Fig. [\ref=fig_temperature] presents the mean Lorentz factor for each species averaged over each cell throughout the pulsar magnetosphere at the end of the simulation, for the highest-multiplicity solution (finj = 1 and [formula]). This figure unambiguously demonstrates the key role of the current sheet in the acceleration of particles [\citep=2014ApJ...785L..33P] [\citep=2014ApJ...795L..22C], but it also highlights an important difference between electrons and positrons. The high-energy positrons are all located beyond the light-cylinder radius, and are confined within the kinking equatorial sheet. Their mean energy is 〈γ〉mec2  ≈  1000mec2, which represents about 17% of the total electric potential drop as discussed below. Energetic electrons reach energies similar to those of the positrons in the equatorial sheet, but they concentrate almost exclusively around the Y-point and the current sheets along the separatrices. This suggests that each species follows a very different path before being accelerated (see below).

Fig. [\ref=fig_spectra] shows the energy spectra of all the particles in the box at the end of the simulation. Below γ = 200, the electron and the positron spectra are very similar; they are both composed of a broad bump peaking at γ  ≈  30. These particles are part of the pulsar wind. Above γ = 200, the positron spectrum presents a second sharp peak at γ  ≈  〈γ〉  ≈  1000, as intense as the wind component, followed by an abrupt cut-off. The electron spectrum also extends up to [formula], but the number of electrons is about 10 times smaller than the number of positrons in this band. The reason for this deficit will become clear in the following. We find that the mean energy reached by the particles in the sheet is given by the magnetization parameter at the light cylinder, away from the equatorial layer, i.e,

[formula]

where BLC, ΓLC  ≈  2, and n+LC  ≈  n-LC  =  κnGJ are respectively the magnetic field strength, the wind bulk Lorentz factor, and the positron/electron densities at the light cylinder. This result is expected if the dissipated magnetic energy is transferred to the plasma and shared equally between the particles. It is also possible to interpret this result in terms of the total potential drop across the open field line region, [formula]. Using nGJ  ≈  ΩBLC / 2πec and [formula], one can rewrite Eq. ([\ref=eq_gamma]) as

[formula]

For finj = 1, the plasma multiplicity in the wind is κ  ≈  1.5 (Fig. [\ref=fig_multiplicity]). Hence, Eq. ([\ref=eq_phi0]) indicates that the particles in the sheet experience on average about 17% of the full potential drop. Some electrons undergo almost 50% of Φ0. Fig. [\ref=fig_sigma] shows that the 〈γ〉  ≈  σLC relation applies for all values of σLC explored in this study.

Ultimately, the best way to understand how and where particles are accelerated is to look at the time history of individual particles. Fig. [\ref=fig_all_particles] shows the trajectories of 157 electrons (top) and 121 positrons (bottom) randomly selected from the newly injected pairs within [formula] and [formula], at t / P = 2.25 for finj = 1 and [formula]. In this figure, one can distinguish the three regions discussed above: the closed and the open field line zones, and the current sheets. In the closed zone, the particles move along the same field line (they are well magnetized) from the star's surface where they are injected, to the other end of the field line back to the star, so that on average the number of particles in the closed zone is nearly constant. However, some particles are trapped by magnetic mirrors, i.e., they are reflected in regions of strong fields back to low field regions, and so on (like in the Van Allen belts in the Earth's magnetosphere). This effect may not occur in real pulsars because the particles are thought to have negligible transverse momenta. Along the open field lines, the particles are simply drifting outward along the quasi-radial field lines, and form the pulsar wind. At the poles, we note that some positrons are pushed back towards the star very soon after their injection (these particles are not shown here). This is due to the surface electric field that sorts the particles to maintain a net negative charge, and the required electric current, at the poles. Finally, the current sheets are identified by the particles moving along the boundary between the open and closed field line regions. Once these particles leave the separatrices, they are trapped along the equatorial current sheet where they follow relativistic Speiser orbits [\citep=1965JGR....70.4219S] [\citep=2007A&A...472..219C] [\citep=2011ApJ...737L..40U] [\citep=2012ApJ...746..148C].

We identify the regions of intense particle acceleration by selecting the particles according to their energy only. Fig. [\ref=fig_HE_particles] shows the trajectories of all the energetic particles from the sample (electrons in blue, positrons in red) whose Lorentz factor reach at least γ = 1000 during their history. These high-energy electrons represent about 2% of the electrons and about 40% of the total energy carried away by the electrons (see Fig. [\ref=fig_spectra]). Energetic positrons represent about 10% of all the positrons, carrying about 50% of the total positron energy. Drawn together, these orbits are exclusively confined to the current sheet regions (both the separatrices and the equatorial sheets, as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig_temperature]). More specifically, all the high-energy particles originate from a narrow range of magnetic footpoints on the surface of the star, spanning from about θ  ~  42o-44o for the positrons, and θ  ~  37o-40o for the electrons (note that these angles depend on the [formula] ratio).

The particles get most of their energy once they reach the equatorial current sheet. Figs. [\ref=fig_electrons], [\ref=fig_positrons] show representative trajectories of energetic electrons and positrons taken from the sample, as well as the time evolution of their Lorentz factors. For positrons, after a first energy gain from γ  ≈  1 to [formula] close to the star, the bulk of the acceleration occurs at the Y-point over a distance of order the light-cylinder radius (see Fig. [\ref=fig_positrons]). Thereafter, their energy increases little with distance. In contrast, the high-energy electrons enter the current sheet further away, typically at [formula]-2RLC and precipitate back towards the star, counter-streaming against the outflowing positrons, in agreement with the two-fluid picture drawn in the previous section (Fig. [\ref=fig_bulk], top panel). As the electrons precipitate, their energy increases almost linearly until they reach the Y-point. At this point, they bounce on the closed zone and flow back towards the star through the separatrices (see Fig. [\ref=fig_electrons]). The counter-streaming of electrons and positrons is maintained throughout the simulation by a non-zero radial electric field in the equatorial current sheet (see also [\citealt=2007A&A...472..219C]). Electron orbits in the sheet also differ from positron orbits because the energetic electrons are moving against the radial [formula] drift while the positrons are moving with it. This difference is exaggerated by the large amplitude of the electron orbits with respect to the layer mid-plane. Presumably, these excursions would rapidly disappear in real pulsars because the perpendicular momentum of the particle would be efficiently radiated away. In addition, the thickness of the current sheet would decrease in reaction to the loss of pressure support in the presence of radiative losses [\citep=2011PhPl...18d2105U] [\citep=2013ApJ...770..147C]. The effect of radiative colling on the pulsar magnetosphere will be explored elsewhere.

Conclusions

We have solved for the structure of the aligned pulsar magnetosphere as a function of the plasma injection rate and magnetization, using high-resolution 2D axisymmetric PIC simulations. Fresh electron-positron pairs are injected at a constant rate with a non-zero velocity from the surface of the star to mimic pair production. If the plasma supply is low, the magnetosphere is highly charge-separated with electrons concentrated at the poles and positrons mostly in the equatorial regions. The pulsar luminosity is smaller than the expected force-free spin-down power of an aligned rotator, and presents a high dissipation rate ([formula]) of the Poynting flux beyond the light cylinder. This solution resembles the model recently proposed by [\citet=2014ApJ...781...46C], in which there are no separatrices or Y-point and the current layer is electrostatically supported. In the extreme regime where there is no pair production, our solution collapses to the static disk-dome solution of "dead" pulsars.

In contrast, we recover a nearly force-free solution of the magnetosphere in the high-multiplicity regime, with the expected spin-down power of an aligned pulsar. A strong current layer forms self-consistently beyond the light cylinder and along the equator, which supports open, quasi-monopolar, magnetic field lines. We find that about 30% of the outgoing Poynting flux is dissipated in the current layer, mostly in the vicinity of the Y-point [\citep=2014ApJ...785L..33P]. These results imply that the pulsar magnetosphere is highly sensitive to dissipation, consistent with earlier force-free simulations, having resistivity effectively confined to the equatorial current sheet, in which more than 20% of the spin-down power was dissipated within ten light-cylinder radii [\citep=2012MNRAS.423.1416P].

This dissipated energy is efficiently transferred to particles in the current sheet. The simulations show that the mean Lorentz factor of the energetic particles is given by the upstream magnetization parameter at the light cylinder, i.e., 〈γ〉  ≈  σLC [\citep=2014ApJ...785L..33P]. We found that the high-energy particles follow one of two particular trajectories in the magnetosphere. They all originate from the boundary layer between the closed and open magnetic field line regions, with a slight offset between electrons and positrons. High-energy positrons stream outward along the separatrix with little change of energy until they reach the Y-point. At this point, there are linearly accelerated in the equatorial sheet by the reconnection electric field, over a distance of order the light-cylinder radius. Energetic electrons only enter the layer further downstream and precipitate back towards the star. Electrons are energized on their way to the Y-point where their acceleration stops abruptly; they then flow back onto the star along the separatrix. This mechanism naturally leads to an excess of energetic positrons flying away from the pulsar. In another publication, we will explore if this result can be related to the contribution of pulsars to the rising positron fraction measured by PAMELA [\citep=2009Natur.458..607A].

Our results suggest that the current sheet, and the separatrix layers, should be intense sources of high-energy radiation in pulsars [\citep=1996A&A...311..172L] [\citep=2002A&A...388L..29K] [\citep=2010ApJ...715.1282B] [\citep=2012MNRAS.424.2023P] [\citep=2013A&A...550A.101A] [\citep=2014ApJ...780....3U]. The precipitation of the energetic electrons onto the star may be an additional source of radiation, an "auroral"-like emission [\citep=2012SSRv..173..341A]. The particles in the wind (outside the layer) follow the [formula] drift velocity. These particles experience no radiative losses and little radiation is expected from this region, unless they upscatter background radiation via inverse-Compton scattering [\citep=2000APh....12..335B] [\citep=2000MNRAS.313..504B] [\citep=2008A&A...488...37C] [\citep=2012Natur.482..507A]. Our simulations ignore synchrotron or curvature radiation cooling which should be important in young pulsars, although we anticipate that the overall structure of the magnetosphere and the acceleration mechanism reported here should be preserved. The other important limitation of this work is the simplistic particle injection. The next logical step towards the understanding of the high-energy emission in pulsars is to perform 3D PIC simulations of the oblique rotator, and to include the physics of pair production in the magnetosphere [\citep=2014arXiv1412.0673P].

Integration of Maxwell's equations on the 2D spherical Yee grid

In this appendix, we derive the expressions of the differential operators [formula], [formula] and [formula] integrated over a 2D axisymmetric cell defined in spherical coordinates (so that any derivative in the azimuthal direction vanishes, ∂  /  ∂φ = 0), as implemented in Zeltron to solve Maxwell's equations. Each cell is labeled by the integers (i,j), i for the radial direction, and j for the θ-direction. The fields are defined on the Yee lattice which is staggered by half a grid cell in both spatial directions, as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig_yee].

[formula] and [formula] can easily be integrated using Stokes' theorem on one cell, i.e.,

[formula]

where [formula] is the surface vector pointing away from the cell, and [formula] is the contour vector circulating around the cell. Applying Eq. ([\ref=stokes]) in each direction gives

[formula]

where [formula], [formula] and [formula]. Similarly, integrating [formula] on the Yee lattice yields

[formula]

with [formula], [formula] and [formula].

To integrate [formula], we make use of Gauss' theorem

[formula]

where [formula] is the volume of the cell, and [formula] is the surface vector pointing away from the cell. It gives

[formula]

with [formula].

These expressions are particularly interesting for this problem because there is no division by zero on the axis (in contrast to the differential expressions). With these expressions at hand and using Maxwell's equations, the fields are given by

[formula]

at the time step n  +  1 for the electric field and [formula] for the magnetic field. The time step Δt is dictated by the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition which, in spherical coordinates, gives

[formula]

Because Zeltron does not conserve electric charge exactly, the electric field must be corrected by solving Poisson's equation. If [formula] is the electric field given by the code, it must be corrected by [formula] such that [formula], where ρ is the charge density. Poisson's equation yields

[formula]

where [formula]. Applying Eq. ([\ref=divE]) in Eq. ([\ref=poisson]), one finds

[formula]

After many iterations (typically about 500), we obtain from Eq. ([\ref=phi]) δΦi,j, and hence the correct electric field. This procedure is repeated every 25 timesteps in the simulations presented here. At the boundaries of the domain, we apply a zero gradient condition, such that ∂(δΦ) / ∂r = 0, ∂(δΦ) / ∂θ = 0.

Interpolation scheme

This section presents the 2D linear interpolation scheme used in the Zeltron code to deposit the charge and current carried by the particles on the spherical grid. Consider a particle of charge Q located at (r,θ), where ri < r < ri + 1 and θj  <  θ  <  θj + 1. Then, the amount of charge deposited on the closest grid nodes is given by the ratio of the volumes shown in Fig. [\ref=fig_interpol], such that

where [formula] is the total volume of the cell, and

[formula]

The same numerical scheme is used in the Boris push to interpolate the fields from the spherical grid to the location of the particles.
