A New Super Congruence Involving Multiple Harmonic Sums

Introduction

Zhao [\cite=Zhao1] first discovered a curious congruence

[formula]

Here p  ≥  3 is a prime and Bn is the n-th Bernoulli number, which is defined by

[formula]

Zhou and Cai [\cite=zhouxia] generalized this congruence to the case of arbitrary number of variables. They showed that for any prime p  ≥  5 and positive integer n  ≤  p - 2,

[formula]

In another direction, Wang and Cai [\cite=Wang] gave a new generalization of ([\ref=zhao1]) by replacing prime p to any prime power. Let Pn denote the set of positive integers which are prime to n. They proved that for any prime p  ≥  3,

[formula]

Zhao [\cite=Zhao4] extended this result to the case when there are four variables. He proved that for and prime p  ≥  5 and integer r  ≥  2,

[formula]

In viewing of congruences ([\ref=Wang]) and ([\ref=Zhao2]), for 1  ≤  k  ≤  n we define

[formula]

It would be very interesting to find a general congruence for S(1)n(pr) modulo pr when n is odd or modulo pr + 1 when n is even. The cases n = 3 and 4 have been solved from ([\ref=Wang]) and ([\ref=Zhao2]). As n increases, the problem becomes much more difficult. The main goal of this paper is to establish the result for the case n = 5.

Let p  >  5 be a prime and r  ≥  2 be an integer. We have

[formula]

While r = 1, by ([\ref=zhou]) the congruence should be [formula] (mod p). This is different to the case r  ≥  2. From ([\ref=zhou]) and ([\ref=Zhao2]), this phenomenon also happens for the case n = 4.

Let p  >  5 be a prime and n be a positive integer. Suppose pr|n but [formula] for some positive integer r. (i) If r = 1, then

[formula]

(ii) If r  ≥  2, then

[formula]

In particular, if n = pr, then part (ii) of Theorem [\ref=thm2] becomes Theorem [\ref=main].

Different from the method used for proving ([\ref=Wang])-([\ref=Zhao2]) (see [\cite=Wang] [\cite=Zhao4]), the idea to prove Theorem [\ref=main] is to establish the recurrence relation

[formula]

And then we only need to prove that [formula] (mod p2). This idea can also be applied to give a new proof of ([\ref=Wang]) and ([\ref=Zhao2]).

Preliminaries

Let p > n be a prime and 1  ≤  k  ≤  n - 1. For any integer r  ≥  1, we have (i) [formula] . (ii) [formula] .

(i) Since [formula] gives a bijection between the solutions of

[formula]

and

[formula]

we have (ii) For any n-tuple [formula] of positive integers satisfying [formula] and [formula], we rewrite them as

[formula]

Since [formula], we know there exists 1  ≤  k  ≤  n - 1 such that

Hence

[formula]

Given 1  ≤  k  ≤  n - 1, the equation [formula] has [formula] solutions [formula] of nonnegative integers. Because

[formula]

and

[formula]

We have This completes the proof of (i).

Let p > 5 be a prime. For 1  ≤  a  ≤  4, we denote by Ca the number of solutions [formula] of nonnegative integers of the equation

[formula]

Then we have (i) [formula]. (ii) [formula] , [formula] , [formula] , [formula] . (iii) [formula] .

(i) Note that for any solution [formula] of the equation

[formula]

at most one of xi  (1  ≤  i  ≤  5) can be greater than or equal to p.

By Inclusion-Exclusion Principle, we deduce that

(ii) For u = 1 or 2 we have

[formula]

Since 1  ≤  a  ≤  4, we deduce that

[formula]

From which the congruences in (ii) follows by (i) and some simple calculations.

(iii) By (ii) we have [formula] (mod p). Hence

[formula]

(Cf. [\cite=zhouxia]) Let [formula] be positive integers, [formula]. Then

[formula]

This leads to the following corollary.

Let α be a positive integer and p  ≥  α + 3 a prime. Then

[formula]

Let p  ≥  3 be a prime, and [formula] be positive integers, where [formula]. We have

For any positive integer α  ≤  p - 3, we have Because [formula] (mod p), we have

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=zhouxialem], we obtain This proves the lemma for n = 1. Now assume the lemma is true when the number of variables is less than n. We have From the assumption, we have

If r is odd, then

If r is even, similarly we can derive

[formula]

The proof of Lemma [\ref=2plem] is complete by induction on n.

By letting r = n = 1 in this lemma, we obtain the following corollary.

Let α be a positive integer and p  ≥  α + 3 be a prime. Then

Let p > 5 be a prime. We have

[formula]

Let [formula] We have

[formula]

Moreover,

[formula]

It is not hard to see Here in the last congruence we use Corollary [\ref=lemcor] and Corollary [\ref=lemcor2].

In the same way, we have Hence from ([\ref=reason]) we deduce that

[formula]

where

We have Here in the last congruence we just replace the variables u3 by u2 and u4 by u3.

Similarly, and

Hence by Lemma [\ref=zhouxialem], we have Substituting this congruence into ([\ref=midterm]) and combining with ([\ref=start]), we obtain By Lemma [\ref=2plem], we have

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

We observe that By ([\ref=zhou]), we have [formula] (mod p). Hence we deduce that

[formula]

This completes the proof.

Proofs of the Theorems

For any 5-tuples [formula] of integers satisfying [formula], 1  ≤  li < pr + 1, li∈Pp, 1  ≤  i  ≤  5, we rewrite them as

[formula]

Since

[formula]

we know there exists 1  ≤  a  ≤  4 such that

[formula]

By (ii) of Lemma [\ref=Casolution], we have [formula] (mod p) for 1  ≤  a  ≤  4. Hence

By (i) of Lemma [\ref=rec], we have [formula] (mod pr) and [formula] (mod pr). Hence

[formula]

By (ii) of Lemma [\ref=rec] we have

[formula]

From ([\ref=add1]) and ([\ref=add2]), by induction on r we can prove [formula] (mod pr  -  1). Combining this with ([\ref=add1]) and ([\ref=add2]), by Lemma [\ref=Casolution] we deduce that

[formula]

From ([\ref=S512rec]) we have

[formula]

Substituting this result into the first congruence of ([\ref=S512rec]), we obtain

[formula]

By ([\ref=zhou]), we have [formula] (mod p). By Lemma [\ref=S52modp] we have [formula] (mod p). Hence from ([\ref=S512rec]) we deduce that

[formula]

Now using ([\ref=S5rec]) and by induction on r we prove [formula] (mod pr) for any prime p > 5 and integer r  ≥  2.

Let n = mpr, where p does not divide m. For any 5-tuples [formula] of integers satisfying [formula], li∈Pp, 1  ≤  i  ≤  5, we rewrite them as

[formula]

Since

[formula]

we know there exists 1  ≤  a  ≤  4 such that

[formula]

For 1  ≤  a  ≤  4, the equation x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 = m - a has [formula] solutions (x1,x2,x3,x4,x5) of nonnegative integers. Hence

[formula]

According to r = 1 or r  ≥  2, we split our proof into two cases.

(i) If r = 1, then from ([\ref=zhou]) we know [formula] (mod p). By Lemma [\ref=S52modp], we deduce that [formula] (mod p). By (i) of Lemma [\ref=rec], we know [formula] (mod p) and [formula] (mod p). Hence from ([\ref=thm2rec]) we have Since [formula] (mod p) and [formula], we complete the proof of (i).

(ii) If r  ≥  2, then from ([\ref=s21]) we deduce that for any integer r  ≥  2, [formula] (mod pr). By (i) of Lemma [\ref=rec], we obtain

[formula]

Hence from ([\ref=thm2rec]) we obtain By Theorem [\ref=main], we have [formula] (mod pr). This completes the proof of (ii).

As we mentioned earlier, naturally we can ask the following question: Can we find two arithmetical functions a(n) and b(n) such that (i) for any odd integer n  ≥  7 and prime p > n,

[formula]

(ii) for any even integer n  ≥  6 and prime p > n,

[formula]

At this stage, we are not able to answer this question. We believe such a(n) and b(n) exist but to solve this problem one may need to develop some new ideas or methods.
