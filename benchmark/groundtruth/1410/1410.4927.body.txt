Boccardo, Gallouët and Orsina [\cite=BGO] have shown that if [formula] is an open bounded set and μ is a bounded (signed) Borel measure on D then μ charges no set of zero Newtonian capacity iff μ can be decomposed into the sum of an integrable function and an element of the dual space H- 1(D) of the Sobolev space H10(D). If we denote by Mb the space of all bounded Borel measures on D with bounded total variation and by M0,b its subset consisting of all measures charging no set of zero capacity then the decomposition of [\cite=BGO] can be stated succinctly as

[formula]

Decomposition ([\ref=eq1.1]) when combined with the analogue of the Lebesgue decomposition theorem saying that each bounded Borel measure on D can be uniquely decomposed into the absolutely continuous and the singular part with respect to the capacity (see Fukushima, Sato and Taniguchi [\cite=FST]) gives complete description of bounded Borel measures on D.

In the language of Dirichlet forms decomposition ([\ref=eq1.1]) says that if μ∈Mb(D) then its variation |μ| is smooth with respect to the capacity associated with the classical Dirichlet form iff μ admits a decomposition into an integrable function and an element of the dual space of the domain of the form. Decomposition ([\ref=eq1.1]) is interesting in its own right and together with the decomposition of [\cite=FST] proved to be useful in investigating elliptic equations involving local operators and measure data (see, e.g., [\cite=BGO] [\cite=DMOP] [\cite=MP]). This and the fact that the decomposition in [\cite=FST] is proved in the setting of general Dirichlet forms motivated us to ask whether ([\ref=eq1.1]) also can be generalized to the case of bounded smooth measures with respect to general Dirichlet form.

The answer to the question is "yes". Let E be a metrizable Lusin space, m be a positive σ-finite measure on the σ-field of Borel subsets of E and let (E,D(E)) be a quasi-regular Dirichlet form on L2(E;m). Our main result says that

[formula]

i.e. if μ is a bounded Borel measure on E then |μ| is smooth with respect to the capacity determined by (E,D(E)) iff μ admits a decomposition of the form

[formula]

where f∈L1(E;m), [formula] and D*(E) is the dual space of D(E) equipped with the inner product 1 (for notation see Section [\ref=sec2]). Moreover, if (E,D(E)) is transient then ([\ref=eq1.2]) holds with D(E)* replaced by the dual F*e of the extended Dirichlet space (Fe,). We also provide a simple example showing that in general in ([\ref=eq1.2]) one cannot replace [formula] by [formula], where S0 is the set of E-smooth measures on E of finite energy (see Section [\ref=sec2]) or, equivalently, the set of all positive elements of D(E)*.

For many interesting classes of forms one can describe the structure of the spaces D(E)*, F*e. Consequently, for such classes decomposition ([\ref=eq1.2]) gives explicit description of the set of bounded smooth measures. In Section [\ref=sec4] we provide some examples to illustrate how ([\ref=eq1.2]) works in practice.

In the paper we assume that (E,D(E)) is a quasi-regular Dirichlet form on L2(E;m) (see [\cite=MOR] [\cite=MR] for the definitions). For [formula] we set Eα(u,v) = E(u,v) + α(u,v), u,v∈D(E), where (  ·  ,  ·  ) stands for the usual inner product in L2(E;m). By (,D(E)) we denote the symmetric part of (E,D(E)) defined as [formula], u,v∈D(E).

By Fe we will denote the the extended Dirichlet space associated with the symmetric Dirichlet form (,D(E)). For u∈Fe we set E(u,u) =  lim n  →    ∞E(un,un), where {un} is an approximating sequence for u (see [\cite=FOT]).

If (E,D(E)) is transient then by [\cite=FOT], (Fe,) is a Hilbert space. Note also that if (E,D(E)) is a quasi-regular Dirichlet form then by [\cite=MR] each element u∈D(E) admits a quasi-continuous m-version denoted by ũ, and that ũ is E-q.e. unique for every u∈D(E). If moreover (E,D(E)) is transient then the last statement holds true for D(E) replaced by Fe (see Remark [\ref=rem2.2]).

Recall that a positive measure μ on B(E) is said to be E-smooth (μ∈S in notation) if μ(B) = 0 for all E-exceptional sets B∈B(E) and there exists an E-nest [formula] of compact sets such that μ(Fk) <   ∞   for [formula].

A measure μ∈S is said to be of finite energy integral (μ∈S0 in notation) if there is c > 0 such that

[formula]

If additionally (E,D(E)) is transient then μ∈S is said to be of finite 0-order energy integral (μ∈S(0)0 in notation) if there is c > 0 such that

[formula]

If (E,D(E)) is regular and E is a locally compact separable metric space then the notion of smooth measures defined above coincides with that in [\cite=FOT]. Moreover, if μ is a positive Radon measure on E such that ([\ref=eq2.11]) is satisfied for all [formula] then μ charges no E-exceptional set (see [\cite=MMS]) and hence μ∈S0.

In the next section in the proof of our main theorem we will need the lemma given below. It follows from the corresponding result for regular forms by the so-called transfer method and perhaps is known, but we could not find proper reference.

Assume that (E,D(E)) is transient. If μ∈S then there is a nest {Fn} such that [formula] for each [formula].

Let (E#,D(E#)) denote the regular extension of (,D(E)) specified by [\cite=MR] and let i:E  →  E# denote the inclusion map. Then (E#,D(E#)) is transient and by Lemma IV.4.5 and Corollary VI.1.4 in [\cite=MR], [formula] is a smooth measure on B(E#). Therefore by the 0-order version of [\cite=FOT] (see remark following [\cite=FOT]) there exists an E#-nest {Fk} on E# such that [formula], k  ≥  1. Let {Ek} be an E-nest of [\cite=MR] and let [formula], [formula]. By [\cite=MR], {Fk'} is an E-nest on E. Put [formula]. We are going to show that μk∈S(0)0, i.e for any nonnegative u∈Fe,

[formula]

for some c > 0. To this end, let us consider an approximating sequence {un} for u and extend u,un to functions u#,u#n on E# by putting u#(x) = u#n(x) = 0 for [formula]. Then E#(u#n - u#l,u#n - u#l)  =  E(un - ul,un - ul) for [formula], so {u#n} is E#-Cauchy sequence. Moreover, since [formula], u#n  →  u# m#-a.e. Consequently, {u#n} is an E#-approximating sequence for u#. It follows that u# belongs to the extended space F#e for E# and E(u,u) = E#(u#,u#). Since [formula] is an m-version of u and by [\cite=MR] the function [formula] is E-quasi-continuous, [formula] E-q.e. From this and the fact that μ#k  =  μk on E it follows that

[formula]

which gives ([\ref=eq2.06]).

Note that the argument following ([\ref=eq2.06]) shows that each u∈Fe admits an E-quasi-continuous modification.

Let us recall that by [\cite=MR] there exists an m-tight special standard Markov process [formula] properly associated with (E,D(E)). By [\cite=MR] the last statement means that for every α > 0 and f∈L2(E;m) the resolvent (Rα)α > 0 of [formula] defined as

[formula]

(Ex stands for the expectation with respect to Px) is an E-quasi-continuous version of Gαf, where (Gα)α > 0 is the resolvent associated with (E,D(E)).

Let Mb denote the set of all Borel measures μ on E such that |μ|(E) <   ∞  , where |μ| is the total variation of μ. By M0,b we denote the set of all measures μ∈Mb such that |μ|∈S and by M+0,b the subset of M0,b consisting of all positive measures. Since |μ|∈S iff μ can be expressed as μ  =  μ+  -  μ- with μ+,μ-∈S, we have [formula]. To shorten notation, given a measure μ on E and a function [formula] we write

[formula]

whenever the integral is well defined.

In what follows we consider D(E) (resp. Fe) to be equipped with the scalar product 1(  ·  ,  ·  ) (resp. (  ·  ,  ·  )). By D(E)* (resp. F*e) we denote the dual space of D(E) (resp. F*e).

If [formula] then |μ|∈S.

Since the notions of the spaces D(E)*, S only depend on the symmetric part of the form, we may and do assume that (E,D(E)) is symmetric. Let us define (E#,D(E#)), E#, i as in the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem2.2] and set [formula]. Then μ# is a bounded Borel measure on E# and μ#∈D(E#)*. Moreover, by [\cite=MR], |μ|∈S iff μ# is smooth with respect to (E#,D(E#)). Therefore without loss of generality we may and do assume that E is a locally compact separable metric space, m is a positive Radon measure on E with [m] = E and (E,D(E)) is a regular form on L2(E;m). Let [formula] be a Hahn decomposition of E (for the measure μ) and B be a Borel subset of E such that (B) = 0. We may assume that B  ⊂  E+. For every ε > 0 there exists a compact set K  ⊂  B and an open set U such that B  ⊂  U  ⊂  E and [formula]. Let (EU,D(EU)) denote the part of (E,D(E)) on U. Let [formula] be such that [formula] and let [formula]. Then [formula], [formula] and

[formula]

Since [formula], we have

[formula]

Let [formula] (resp. U) denote the capacity associated with the form (E,D(E)) (resp. (EU,D(EU))) (see [\cite=FOT]). Since [formula] is a special standard core of EU, ([\ref=eq3.01]) and [\cite=FOT] imply that

[formula]

the last inequality being a consequence of the fact that if (K) = 0 then U(K) = 0, which follows from Exercise III.2.10, Theorem III.2.11(ii) and Theorem IV.5.29(i) in [\cite=MR]. Hence μ+(B)  ≤  2ε for ε > 0, which shows that μ+∈S. In much the same way we show that μ-∈S. Thus |μ|∈S, and the proof is complete.

Assume that (E,D(E)) is transient and let μ∈Mb. Then μ∈M0,b iff there exists f∈L1(E;m) and [formula] such that

[formula]

i.e. for every bounded u∈Fe,

[formula]

Since the notions of the spaces of S, Fe,F*e only depend on (,D(E)), we may and do assume that (E,D(E)) itself is symmetric. First assume that μ∈M0,b. Without loss of generality we may assume that μ is positive. By Lemma [\ref=lem2.2] there exists a nest {Fn} such that [formula]. Clearly [formula] and, since [formula] is exceptional and μ is smooth, [formula]. Let [formula] be an m-tight special standard Markov process properly associated with (E,D(E)), (Rα)α > 0 be the resolvent of [formula] and let Aμn be a positive continuous additive functional of [formula] associated with μn in the Revuz sense (see [\cite=MR]). For α > 0 set

[formula]

where

[formula]

By [\cite=MMS], UαAμn1 is an E-quasi-continuous version of the α-potential Uαμn of μn. From this and [\cite=MMS] it follows that

[formula]

for every nonnegative Borel measurable u. From this one can deduce that

[formula]

for u∈F. Let u∈Fe and let {uk}  ⊂  D(E) be an approximating sequence for u. Then

[formula]

for every [formula], because by ([\ref=eq3.17]),

[formula]

Letting k  →    ∞   in ([\ref=eq3.18]) we get

[formula]

Thus μαn∈S(0)0. Given γ∈S(0)0 let us denote be Tγ the bounded linear operator on Fe defined as

[formula]

From ([\ref=eq3.6]) it follows that for every [formula],

[formula]

where [formula] stands for the operator norm of Tμαn. By the above and the Banach-Saks theorem, for every [formula] we can choose a sequence {αnl} such that αnl  →    ∞   as l  →    ∞   and the sequence {U(γk(μn))}, where

[formula]

is E-convergent to some g∈Fe as k  →    ∞  . Equivalently, [formula] as k  →    ∞  , where T(u) = E(g,u) for u∈Fe. On the other hand, by ([\ref=eq3.17]) and [\cite=MR], for every u∈Fe,

[formula]

as α  →    ∞  . It follows that in fact T = Tμn. We can therefore find a subsequence {kn} such that

[formula]

for every [formula]. Set

[formula]

Then

[formula]

Since m is σ-finite, there exists a sequence {Ul} of Borel subsets of E such that [formula], Ul  ⊂  Ul + 1 and m(Ul) <   ∞  , [formula]. By ([\ref=eq3.3]),

[formula]

for every α > 0. Therefore for for every [formula] we have

[formula]

Hence [formula] by the monotone convergence theorem. It follows in particular that ν  =  μ - f  ·  m∈Mb. On the other hand, by ([\ref=eqa.2]), ν∈F*e, which proves that μ is of the form ([\ref=eq3.1]).

Now suppose that μ is given by the right-hand side of ([\ref=eq3.1]). Since f  ·  m∈M0,b, we only have to prove that if [formula] then |μ|∈S. But this follows from Proposition [\ref=prop3.1] since F*e  ⊂  D(E)*.

If μ∈Mb. Then μ∈M0,b iff there exist f∈L1(E;m), ν∈D(E)* such that ([\ref=eq3.2]) holds true for every bounded u∈D(E).

The Dirichlet form (E1,D(E)) is transient, quasi-regular and its extended Dirichlet space is (D(E),1). Moreover, |μ| is smooth with respect to (E1,D(E)) iff it is smooth with respect to (E1,D(E)). Therefore the corollary follows from Theorem [\ref=th3.3] applied to the form (E1,D(E)).

Let μ∈Mb. Then μ∈M0,b iff there exist f∈L1(E;m), v∈D(E) such that for every bounded u∈D(E),

[formula]

Follows immediately from Corollary [\ref=cor3.3] and the Lax-Milgram theorem.

(i) In general, [formula] in decomposition ([\ref=eq1.2]) cannot be replaced by [formula]. To see this, let us consider the classical Dirichlet form (see Example [\ref=ex4.1] in the next section) with [formula], where B(0,r) denote the open ball with radius r > 0 and center at 0. Let σan denote the surface measure on ∂B(0,an) with an = n- 1 / 4, and let

[formula]

From [\cite=FOT] it follows that σan∈S for each [formula]. Hence μ∈S. Moreover, [formula], so μ∈M+0,b. Let

[formula]

be a decomposition of μ of Theorem [\ref=th3.3]. Then ν∉S0 - S0. To show this, let us denote by μs,νs the singular parts (with respect to the Lebesgue measure) of μ and ν, respectively, and observe that μ  =  μs  =  νs. Suppose that ν∈S0 - S0. Then ν+,ν-∈S0 and hence ν+s,ν-s∈S0, because ν+s  ≤  ν+ and ν-s  ≤  ν-. Consequently, μs  =  ν+s  -  ν-s∈S0 - S0, which implies that μ∈S0 since μ is positive. On the other hand, if we set u(x) = |x|- 2 - 1, x∈D, then u∈H10(D) and

[formula]

which is a contradiction, because by [\cite=FOT], if μ∈S0 then quasi-continuous elements of H10(D) are integrable with respect to μ. (ii) From the proof of Theorem [\ref=th3.3] it follows that if μ∈M+0,b then the L1 part f of its decomposition can be chosen to be positive. The example above shows that in general this is not true for ν, because if ν in ([\ref=eq3.7]) were positive, we would have μ∈S0 and hence μ∈S0. (iii) By the definition of S0, [formula]. The opposite inclusion is false and ν of ([\ref=eq3.7]) can serve as a counterexample. Below we give an explicit construction of another counterexample. Let D, an, σan be defined as in (i) and let [formula], so that [formula] Let νan(x), νbn(x) denote the first components of the outer normal vectors to ∂B(0,an) and ∂B(0,bn) at point x. Set

[formula]

Then μ∈M0,b and for every η∈H10(D) we have

[formula]

Hence μ∈H- 1(D). But |μ|∉H- 1(D), because if it were true, the series

[formula]

would be convergent.

In this section we apply Theorem [\ref=th3.3] to give explicit description of the set M0,b for some classes of regular local forms, regular nonlocal forms and quasi-regular forms.

(classical Dirichlet form) Let [formula] be a bounded domain. Consider the classical form

[formula]

It is known that [formula] is a transient regular Dirichlet form on L2(D;dx) (see [\cite=FOT]). If μ∈M+b, then μ∈S iff μ charges no set of Newtonian capacity zero. By Poincaré's inequality, the norms determined by [formula] and [formula] are equivalent (of course, the norm determined by [formula] is the usual norm in the Sobolev space H10(D)). As a consequence, Fe = H10(D) and hence F*e = H- 1(D). From Theorem [\ref=th3.3] and the well known characterization of H- 1(D) it follows that if μ∈Mb then μ∈M0,b iff

[formula]

for some f0∈L1(D;dx) and [formula] such that Fi∈L2(D;dx), [formula]. We see that in the case of classical form the decomposition of Theorem [\ref=th3.3] reduces to the decomposition proved in [\cite=BGO].

On can easily check that ([\ref=eq4.1]) holds for more general (possibly nonsymmetric) regular Dirichlet forms defined by Eq. (2.17) in [\cite=MR] with coefficients satisfying the assumptions of [\cite=MR].

(regular nonlocal Dirichlet forms) Let [formula] be a continuous negative definite function, [formula], and let

[formula]

where [formula] is the space of tempered distributions and û is the Fourier transform of u. Note that [formula]. Let us consider the form

[formula]

It is known (see [\cite=FOT]) that (Ψ,Hψ,1) is a symmetric regular Dirichlet form on [formula].

By [\cite=J] the dual space of Hψ,1 is the space Hψ, - 1 in the sense that for every ν∈(Hψ,1)* there is v∈Hψ, - 1 such that û may be interpreted as an element of [formula] and the value of ν on u∈Hψ,1 is equal to [formula]. Therefore from Corollary [\ref=cor3.3] it follows that if μ∈M0,b then there exist [formula], v∈ Hψ, - 1 such that for every bounded u∈Hψ,1,

[formula]

Since [formula] for ψ(ξ) = |ξ|2, the above decomposition may be viewed as a generalization of ([\ref=eq4.1]).

(gradient Dirichlet forms on infinite dimensional space) Let H be a separable real Hilbert space and let A be a self-adjoint operator A such that 〈Ax,x〉H  ≤    -  ω|x|2H, x∈D(A), for some ω > 0 and A- 1 is of trace class. Let [formula] and let γ denote the Gaussian measure on H with mean 0 and covariance operator Q∞. We consider the form

[formula]

where FC∞b is the space of finitely based smooth bounded functions on H (see [\cite=MR] and [formula] is the H-gradient defined for u∈FC∞b as the unique element of H such that [formula] for x∈H. By [\cite=MR] the form (E,FC∞b) is closable and its closure, which we denote by (E,W1,2(H)), is a symmetric Dirichlet form. Moreover, by results of [\cite=MR], it is quasi-regular.

By Corollary [\ref=cor3.4], if μ∈Mb then μ∈M0,b iff there exist f∈L1(H;γ), v∈W1,2(H) such that for every bounded u∈W1,2(H),

[formula]

In fact, μ∈M0,b iff for some f0∈L1(H;γ), F∈L2(H;γ) it can be written in the form

[formula]

similar to ([\ref=eq4.1]). Indeed, if μ∈M0,b then by ([\ref=eq4.2]),

[formula]

with f0 = v + f∈L1(H;γ), [formula]. On the other hand, if F∈C1b(H;H) has finite divergence with respect to γ (see [\cite=DPZ] for the definition) then by [\cite=DPZ],

[formula]

where γF(x) = F(x) - 〈Q- 1∞x,F(x)〉H, x∈H, which when combined with ([\ref=eq4.4]) makes it legitimate to write μ in the form ([\ref=eq4.3]). Conversely, if μ∈Mb and μ is of the form ([\ref=eq4.3]) for some f0∈L1(H;γ), F∈L2(H;γ) then γF∈Mb and by ([\ref=eq4.5]),

[formula]

for all bounded u∈W1,2(H). That γF is smooth now follows from [\cite=FOT].

The assertion that M0,b iff μ has decomposition ([\ref=eq4.3]) holds true for forms more general than those considered in Example [\ref=ex4.3]. In fact, modifying slightly the argument in Example [\ref=ex4.3] one can show that it holds for the form being a closure of the form defined by Eq. (20) in [\cite=F] if Hypotheses 3.1. and 3.2 (the last with R = R* > 0 such that R- 1 is bounded) in [\cite=F] are satisfied.
