Stability analysis for linear heat conduction with memory kernels described by Gamma functions GammaMem.tex, Corrado MASCIA

Abstract. This paper analyzes heat equation with memory in the case of kernels that are linear combinations of Gamma distributions. In this case, it is possible to rewrite the non-local equation as a local system of partial differential equations of hyperbolic type. Stability is studied in details by analyzing the corresponding dispersion relation, providing sufficient stability condition for the general case and sharp instability thresholds in the case of linear combination of the first three Gamma functions.

Introduction

The present paper is based on three keywords: diffusion, memory and stability. The starting ingredient is a scalar quantity u satisfying

[formula]

where [formula] and v is the flux. Equation [\eqref=cons] has to be completed with an additional relation for the unknown v. The classical Fourier law (for heat conduction) prescribes that the flux is proportional to the space derivative of the unknown u,

[formula]

The couple [\eqref=cons]-[\eqref=fourierlaw] gives raise to the well-known heat equation, which, being parabolic, has a number of appealing features (well-posedness, smoothing effects...) At the same time, it also exhibits some deficiencies, the most striking being the infinite speed of propagation of disturbances. To mend such a flaw (and for other motivations which are not discussed here) alternative laws for the flux v has been proposed.

The most famous, suggested by Cattaneo in [\cite=Catt48], assumes that the equilibrium between flux and gradient, istantaneous in [\eqref=fourierlaw], is in fact described by a dynamical relation of relaxation type, namely

[formula]

where τ > 0 is an additional parameter describing the relaxation timescale. The couple [\eqref=cons]-[\eqref=catlaw] gives raise to a damped wave equation for the unkwnon u. Hyperbolicity of the model permits to trespass many of the flaws of the heat equation.

The Cattaneo's law [\eqref=catlaw] can be rephrased into a more general framework in which the flux is not given by the istantaneous value of the gradient of u, but it is rather an average of its history. Precisely, equation [\eqref=catlaw] is equivalent to the assumption that the flux v satisfies the convolution relation

[formula]

with a kernel g of exponential type, i.e. g(t) = α  e- t / τ  /  τ.

As stated in [\cite=JosePrez89], it would be a miracle if for some real conductor the relaxation kernel could be rigorously represented by an exponential kernel with a single time of relaxation, as is required by Cattaneo's model. Infact, the exponential choice can be considered as a stratagem which permits to trade the non-local relation [\eqref=memo] with the local relation [\eqref=catlaw], as a consequence of the property

[formula]

The conservation equation [\eqref=cons] coupled with the memory law [\eqref=memo] gives raise to the non-local equation

[formula]

which is meaningful for a class of memory kernel g containing the pure exponentials as a special case. The Fourier law [\eqref=fourierlaw] can be recovered assuming that the kernel g is a Dirac delta distribution concentrated at t = 0.

Considering relation [\eqref=memlaw] for modelling heat conduction has been proposed many years ago in [\cite=GurtPipk68], and it has received an increasing interest in recent years (among others, see [\cite=ChepMainPata06] [\cite=ContMarcPata13] [\cite=GiorNasoPata01] and references therein). Usually, it is assumed that the function g is a function with values in [formula].

Let [formula]. Given [formula], the system of ordinary differential equations for the unknowns ψj  =  ψj(t) has a unique bounded solution [formula]. Such solution is given by ψj  =  Tjψ0 for any [formula], with Tj defined in [\eqref=trasfk].

For j  ≥  2, integrating by parts, we infer Thus, since I1 = 1, there holds Ij = 1 for any j. Therefore we infer which gives Moreover, each gj solves an appropriate Cauchy problem, viz. Then, differentiating the definition ψ1: = T1ψ0 we obtain Similarly, differentiating ψj: = Tjψ0 for j  ≥  2, we infer To conclude the proof, it has to be shown that the problem has at most one solution, viz. the one just exhibited. Assuming that ψ1j and ψ2j both solve the prescribed linear system, the difference Ψj: = ψ1j  -  ψ2j is a bounded solution to Then, Ψ1 is clearly zero and, by induction, also Ψj is zero for any j  ≥  2.

Thanks to Proposition [\ref=prop:lintrick], the non-local problem can be reduced to a system of partial differential equations when the memory kernel g has the form [\eqref=kernelform] for some natural k and [formula]. Indeed, there holds so that the problem is equivalent to the system

[formula]

System [\eqref=gensys] can be rewritten in vectorial form as

[formula]

where [formula] and

[formula]

where [formula] and

[formula]

The hyperbolicity character of the system is recognized analyzing the principal term in [\eqref=vector] and, specifically, the spectral properties of the matrix [formula].

The matrix [formula] has real eigenvalues if and only if θ1  ≥  0. Moreover, the matrix [formula]

i. if θ1 = 0, has a single eigenvalue 0 with algebraic multiplicity equal to n + 2 and geometric multiplicity equal to n;

ii. if θ1 > 0, has three eigenvalues: [formula] (each with multiplicity equal to 1) and 0 (with algebraic and geometric multiplicity equal to k).

The eigenvalue problem is [formula]. Therefore, since the statement on the eigenvalues and the algebraic multiplicity holds. Moreover, for λ = 0, the eigenvalue problem reduces to the conditions which define a vector space of dimension k in [formula].

As a consequence of Lemma [\ref=lem:hyperb], it is reasonable to concentrate the attention on the case θ1 > 0, since only in such a case the principal part of the system is diagonalizable and thus the Cauchy problem is well-posed.

A diagonalizing matrix can be determined by computing the k + 2 independent eigenvectors. Since the eigenvalue problem reads as a choice of eigenvectors is where δij is the Kronecker symbol. Such eigenvectors, considered as column vectors, define a change of coordinates [formula] such that, setting [formula], the principal part of the system [\eqref=vector] is diagonalized where [formula] and [formula].

Small and large frequencies analysis

Applying Fourier-Laplace transform, system [\eqref=vector] is converted into the system which possesses non-trivial solution if and only if the dispersion relation

[formula]

is satisfied. Such relation can be read in different ways. Here, following the standard approach dictated by the Fourier transform, the variable μ will be considered as a purely imaginary number, i.e. μ = iξ with [formula], and the attention is directed toward the corresponding values of [formula] such that [\eqref=dispersion] is satisfied.

Thanks to the very special structure of the matrices defining the polynomial p, it is possible to determine an explicit formula for it.

Let [formula] and [formula] as in [\eqref=A0A1]-[\eqref=B]. Then, there holds

[formula]

The formula can be proved by induction on k. Indeed, for k = 0 the relation holds, as can be seen by direct computation.

Then, making explicit the dependence on n in the dispersion relation denoting the polynomial by pk, there holds Then, assuming [\eqref=disprel] for k - 1, we infer The proof is complete.

The analysis of the relation p(λ,μ) = 0 gives a complete information on the stability properties in the model. First of all, the behavior for small values of μ, corresponding to the large time-behavior, in case of stability, is very simple. Indeed, setting μ = 0, there holds Thus, there are k + 1 modes that are dissipated with exponential rate (corresponding to the zero - 1 with order k + 1) and there is a single mode with a weaker decay.

In order to explore in details the slow-mode, relative to the value λ = 0, the expansion λ = Aμ + Bμ2 + o(μ2) can be plugged into the dispersion relation, obtaining that is Thus, in a neighborhood of (λ,μ)  ≈  (0,0), the dispersion relation defines the curve This completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:smalllarge], part I.

Next, we investigate the behavior of the couples (λ,μ) satisfying the dispersion relation, in the regime μ  →    ∞  . Keeping track of the highest powers of λ and μ gives Thus, as μ  →    ∞  , setting [formula], the dispersion relation defines a set separated into three branches, given by the asymptotics which corresponds to the eigenvalues of the principal part of the system [\eqref=vector].

The stability properties of such branches are encoded in the subsequent term in the asymptotic expansions for λ as a function of μ. Setting λ  =    ±  κ  μ + C + o(1) with C to be determined, and plugging into the dispersion relation, one obtains which reduces to so that Similarly, choosing λ = C + o(1) and inserting in the dispersion relation, one infers so that the coefficient C satisfies the algebraic relation Such equality can be rewritten as Exchanging the order of the sums, it follows that C is root of the polynomial This completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:smalllarge], part II.

Rephrasing, necessary and sufficient conditions for stability in the high frequency regime are θ2  <  θ1 and the request that the polynomial Q is a (strict) Hurwitz polynomial, i.e. a polynomial whose roots have strictly negative real parts. Verification of the latter condition can be done by using the Routh-Hurwitz stability condition. Let us consider some explicative examples, when [formula]. We list the explicit form of the polynomial Q and the corresponding Routh-Hurwitz array for the first integers and for specific choices of the parameters θj: for k = 2 and general θj, for k = 3, with θ2  =  θ3 = 0, for k = 4, with θ2  =  θ3  =  θ4 = 0, In particular, large frequency stability holds for k = 2 (any case), k = 3 and θ1 > 1 / 9, k = 4 and θ1 > 1 / 5.

For higher values of k, the necessary and sufficient conditions appear difficult to be translated in a simple condition that is directly readable from the values of the coefficients θk. Nevertheless, for θ1 sufficiently large with respect to the other coefficients θj, [formula], the stability condition is satisfied.

Let k  ≥  2 and let [formula] be such that

[formula]

Then the system [\eqref=gensys] is stable in the high-frequency regime.

The polynomial Q can be rewritten as In the case θj = 0 for any j  ≠  1, the polynomial reduces to (1 + x)k and, thus, it has a single root x =  - 1 with algebraic multiplicity equal to k. Changing the values of θj, the location of the roots changes smoothly. Let θj be such that there exists [formula] for which Q(iy) = 0. Then, there holds Then, we infer the estimate In particular, as soon as the condition [\eqref=bigtheta1] is satisfied, no roots of the polynomial Q may intersect the imaginary axis.

As follows from the above analysis of the Routh-Hurwitz arrays, the above condition is not sharp. In fact, in the case k = 3, with θ2  =  θ3 = 0 and θ4 = 1 - θ1, high frequency stability is equivalent to the requirement θ1 > 1 / 9, while [\eqref=bigtheta1] becomes θ1 > 1 / 2. Similarly, for k = 4, with θ2  =  θ3  =  θ4 = 0 and θ5 = 1 - θ1, high frequency stability is equivalent to θ1 > 1 / 5, while [\eqref=bigtheta1] still corresponds to θ1 > 1 / 2.

Intermediate frequency analysis

Next, we pass to the analysis of the dispersion relation [\eqref=dispersion] (with p explicitly given in [\eqref=disprel]) in the intermediate frequency regime, under the assumption that the system is stable in the large frequency regime. In particular, we assume θ2  <  θ1.

For λ  ≠   - 1, the relation can be rewritten as Let (iζ,iξ) with ξ  ≠  0 be such that the above equality is satisfied; then there hold

[formula]

so that, given ζ satisfying the first relation, ξ is such that

[formula]

if and only if the term on the righthand side is positive. Both the real part of (1 - iζ)j and the imaginary part of (1 - iζ)j  /  ζ contain only even power of ζ; hence the above relations can be rewritten in term of the single variable s = ζ2.

We claim that if [\eqref=condanyk] holds, then the first relation in [\eqref=realimag] has no solutions. Indeed, the first condition in [\eqref=realimag] can be rewritten as

[formula]

Since under the condition [\eqref=condanyk], the relation [\eqref=firstcond] cannot be satisfied.

Combinations of the first three Gamma distributions

Condition [\eqref=condanyk], stated in Theorem [\ref=thm:anyk], is sufficient, but not necessary. Here, we restrict the attention to the case k = 2, that is we concentrate on kernels g of the form

[formula]

with the aim of determining the sharp threshold separating stability and instability. Indeed, in this situation, it is possible to determine a complete characterization of the choices of the coefficients θ1,θ2,θ3 giving raise to stable dynamics, as encoded in Theorem [\ref=thm:k=2].

Setting s = ζ2, the first equality in [\eqref=realimag] becomes that is

[formula]

Assuming θ2  <  θ1 (necessary condition for high-frequency stability), equation [\eqref=defesse] has positive roots if and only if which can be equivalently rewritten as

[formula]

If these conditions are satisfied, for s satisfying [\eqref=defesse], the expression [\eqref=xi2] for ξ2 reduces to having used the relation θ1(1 + s)2  +  θ2(1 + s)(1 - s) + θ3(1 - 3s) = 0.

Thus, the unknown ξ is explictly given by where s = ζ2 is a positive root of [\eqref=defesse].

A graphical representation of the different stability regimes relative to the values of parameter θ1,θ2,θ3 is given in Figure [\ref=fig:stabregions1], where the regions lie in the plane (η2,η3) with ηj: = θj  /  θ1.

In the analysis of diffusion equations with memory, a typical requirement on the kernel g concerns with its monotonicity and convexity properties. Thus, we continue the study of the case [\eqref=kernelk=2] determining the parameter range in which such assumptions are satisfied. Let us set Our aim is to compare S with the regions M and C of monotonicity and mononotonicity + convexity, respectively.

Monotonicity. There holds where, as usual, ηk  =  θk  /  θ1. Then, g is decreasing if and only if the polynomial is positive for any t > 0. Since η3 > 0, a necessary condition is p1(0) = 2(1 - η2) > 0. If this is satisfied, then the condition holds if and only if Collecting, we deduce that, in the plane (η2,η3), the parameters region in which g is decreasing is Convexity. Differentiating, we infer Then, g is convex if and only if the polynomial is positive for any t > 0. Again, since η3 > 0, a necessary condition is p2(0) = 2(1 - 2η2  +  η3) > 0. If this holds, function g is convex if and only if Hence, the region C in the plane (η2,η3) is the parameters region in which g is decreasing is

Relation with stability. By inspection, it can be seen that A graphic representation of the regions S, C and M is provided in Figure [\ref=fig:SMC].

Thus, for kernels of the form [\eqref=kernelk=2], stability is guaranteed by convexity. This is coherent with the result in [\cite=ContMarcPata13], taking into account that the function μ corresponds to - g'. Indeed, such result is relative to convex kernels (μ non-increasing) and apply to the present case since the "flatness rate" (see details in the above reference) for kernel of the form [\eqref=kernelk=2] is always zero.

Also, still in the case of kernel of the form [\eqref=kernelk=2], non-monotonicity implies instability. Differently, we can state that monotonicity is a necessary condition for stability for kernels [\eqref=kernelk=2], consistently with Theorem 1.5 in [\cite=ChepMainPata06] (proved for a general class of memory kernels).

Finally, the analysis exhibits a large region of decreasing non-convex kernels divided into two parts by the stability/instability transition line. In particular, there exist (monotone) kernels g which are stable even if not convex.
