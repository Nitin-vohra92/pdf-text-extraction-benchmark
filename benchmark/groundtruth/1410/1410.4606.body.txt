Nonlinear dynamics of Josephson vortices in a film screen under dc and ac magnetic fields

Introduction

Dynamics of Josephson vortices in long Josephson junctions (LJJs) under dc and ac magnetic fields has been the subject of much interest [\cite=KL] [\cite=BP] [\cite=MT] [\cite=LS] [\cite=MS] [\cite=FD] [\cite=N]. For instance, the barrier and overlap LJJs have been studied extensively for applications in superconducting electronics [\cite=KL] [\cite=BP], particularly flux flow oscillators [\cite=ffo] [\cite=KS] [\cite=SS] [\cite=SSb]. The electrodynamics of LJJ has attracted a renewed attention after the discovery of high-Tc superconducting cuprates and iron based superconductors in which the grain boundaries between misoriented crystallites behave as long Josephson junctions which subdivide the materials into weakly coupled superconducting regions [\cite=GB] [\cite=DG]. The latter gives rise to the electromagnetic granularity [\cite=HB] which is one of the serious obstacles for applications of the cuprate and the iron-based superconductors [\cite=ag].

Another situation in which the weak-linked grain boundaries becomes essential occurs in superconducting resonator cavities [\cite=cav] in which the amplitudes of the radio-frequency (≃0.1 - 5 GHz) screening currents flowing at the inner surface of the cavity can approach the depairing current density Jd. In this case the grain boundaries even in such conventional materials as Nb can behave as LJJs [\cite=gbi1] [\cite=gbi2] [\cite=gbi3] [\cite=gbi4] [\cite=gbi5], even though they do not manifest themselves as weak links in dc magnetization or transport properties at much lower dc currents J  ≪  Jd. It has been suggested that the Josephson vortices penetrating through grain boundaries can account for the linear decrease of the quality factors Q(Ha) in Nb resonator cavities [\cite=gbi4] [\cite=gbi5] [\cite=medQ]. Penetration of Josephson vortices under ac fields can also result in dissipation in polycrystalline thin films screen or multilayers [\cite=ml]. Understanding the electrodynamics of Josephson vortices in weak-linked grain boundaries requires addressing the following issues: 1. The minimum amplitude of the ac field Hp(ω) the Josephson vortices start penetrating the LJJ and the relation between Hp and the dc lower critical field. 2. The field dependence of the power P(Ha) dissipated in the LJJ at Ha > Hp and its contribution to the nonlinear surface resistance Rs(Ha). 3. The effect of a finite length of the LJJ on Hp and P(Ha) which would account for a finite grain size in polycrystalline materials of a finite film thickness in a screen [\cite=ml].

In this paper we address a nonlinear electromagnetic response of a single LJJ across a thin film screen in a parallel field. We solved the sine-Gordon equation numerically to calculate the dynamics of penetration, annihilation and exit of Josephson vortices and antivortices oscillating under the ac field. The paper is organized as follows. In Section [\ref=sec:elj] we specify the main equations, the geometry and the boundary conditions. In Section [\ref=sec:dcfield] we consider a LJJ in a thin film screen in a dc field and calculate the field-dependence of the power dissipated due to a net flow of Josephson vortices along the LJJ. In Section [\ref=sec:acfield] we consider a LJJ in a periodic ac field H = Ha sin ωt and calculate the frequency dependence of the penetration field Hp(ω) for Josephson vortices, and the dissipated power as a function of Ha and ω. In the overdamped limit, the results of this section are in agreement with the previous works by McDonald and Clem[\cite=Mc] and Zhai et al.[\cite=Sr], but are inconsistent with the assumption of Ref. [\cite=gbi4] [\cite=gbi5] that the surface resistance of a LJJ increases linearly with the amplitude of the rf field. In Section [\ref=sec:asyacfield] we consider the response of the LJJ to an asymmetric ac magnetic field which causes a net force on the vortex, namely, a superposition of dc and ac fields, and a double-mode ac field which results in a dynamic ratchet effect. Section [\ref=sec:diss] contains a discussion of the results.

Electrodynamics of a Long Junction

We consider a LJJ perpendicular to a flat screen of width L as shown in . The uniform magnetic field H(t) is applied along the y-axis parallel to one side of the screen at x = 0. At the other side of the screen we assume the boundary condition H(L,t) = 0. The LJJ is described by the sine-Gordon equation for the gauge-invariant phase difference γ(x,t) [\cite=KL] [\cite=BP] [\cite=MT] Here the subscripts x and t denote partial derivatives over x and t, respectively, λJ = (cφ0 / 8π2dJc)1 / 2 is the Josephson penetration depth, Jc is the critical current density of the junction, ωp is the Josephson plasma frequency, ωc is the decrement due to quasiparticle ohmic currents, c is the speed of light, φ0 is the magnetic flux quantum, C is the specific capacitance of the junction, Ri is the quasiparticle specific resistance per unit area, d  ≈  2λ, and λ is the London penetration depth.

As an illustration, we estimate ωp and ωc for Nb at different ratios of Jc / Jd where [formula] is the bulk depairing current density, and ξ is the coherence length. Taking λ  ≈  ξ  ≈  40 nm, the typical excess grain boundary resistance Ri = 2  ×  10- 13 Ωm2 for Nb [\cite=gbn], and C = ε / 4πdi where ε≃3 is the static dielectric constant of filled electron bands and di≃1 nm is the atomic width of the grain boundary, we obtain Jd≃150 MA/cm2, and RiJd≃0.3V. Then ωc≃1015(Jc / Jd) Hz, and ωp≃4  ·  1014(Jc / Jd)1 / 2 Hz. The McCumber parameter βc = (ωc  /  ωp)2≃6Jc / Jd defines the effect of dissipation for a steady-state propagation of Josephson vortices; the case of βc  ≪  1 corresponds to the overdamped limit in which dissipative ohmic currents dominate over the displacement currents described by the inertial term [formula] in . The Josephson weak link is by definition an interface with Jc  ≪  Jd so, for the above numbers, the grain boundaries would be in the overdamped limit. However, Jc across grain boundaries in Nb can be very high and close to Jdξ  /  λ in which case is no longer valid and the equation for γ(x,t) becomes nonlocal particularly in materials with large Ginzburg-Landau parameter λ  /  ξ [\cite=nje1] [\cite=nje2] [\cite=nje3]. In this work we only consider the local Josephson limit described by both for βc > 1 and βc < 1.

For the geometry shown in 1, the local field distribution along the LJJ B(x,t) = (φ0 / 4πλ)γx(x,t) defines the boundary conditions at x = 0 and x = L:

[formula]

As will be shown below, penetration and annihilation of Josephson vortices can result in significant instant power dissipation [formula] per unit height of the junction along the y-axis, where V = φ0γt / 2πc is the voltage, and J(x,t) is a sum of the Josephson, ohmic and displacement current densities:

[formula]

In a periodic ac field the contributions of Josephson and displacement currents vanish after averaging over the ac period T = 2π  /  ω. As a result, the average power is caused only by the ohmic currents:

[formula]

Dc field

The behavior of a LJJ in a static magnetic field is characterized by two field regions [\cite=KL] [\cite=BP]. At low fields 0 < H < Hc1J the LJJ is in a Meissner state in which the local magnetic field B(x)  =  φ0γx / 4πλ is screened at the edge of the junction over the length ~  λJ. At high fields, H > Hc1J penetration of Josephson vortices each carrying the flux quantum φ0 becomes thermodynamically favorable. There is also the field region Hc1J < H < H1 of metastable Meissner state, where H1  =  πHc1J / 2 plays the role of a superheating field at which the edge energy barrier for the penetration of Josephson vortices disappears. Here Hc1J and H1 are given by

[formula]

To calculate the dynamics of penetration of vortices at H > H1 we solve numerically. It is convenient to write in a dimensionless form, using the rescaled variables x  →  x / λJ and t  →  ωpt:

[formula]

where [formula]. The boundary conditions and the instant power take the form

[formula]

where l = L / λJ, h = (4πλλJ  /  φ0)H, [formula] and [formula] is the Swihart velocity [\cite=BP] [\cite=MT].

We first consider the overdamped limit in which the term [formula] can be neglected and turns into a nonlinear diffusion equation,

[formula]

Solutions of are shown in for α  =  1, L = 20λJ and different magnetic fields H. (a) shows the metastable Meissner state at Hc1J < H < H1, in which the magnetic flux is screened at the edge over the length ~  λJ. (b) shows the case of H  =  H1 at which the first vortex nucleates at the edge and accelerates until the velocity becomes limited by the friction force of ohmic currents. (c) shows the flux flow state at higher field H = 5H1 at which vortices periodically enter, travel all the way to the other end at x = L where they disappear. This dynamic state is characteristic of a thin film screen [\cite=ml] in which the LJJ provides a path for constant flux pumping from the region of applied field to the inner region of H = 0, unlike a stationary chain of Josephson vortices in a uniform field which is the same of both edges of the junction [\cite=KL] [\cite=BP].

(a) shows the evolution of the local field B(x,t) along the LJJ and the instant power P(t) at H = 2H1 and α = 1. One can see that each penetration and annihilation of vortices at the edges produces peaks in P(t). The highest peak in P(t) occurs during penetration of the first vortex at x = 0 after the field was turned on and the vortex is accelerated strongly by the Lorentz force of screening current. After penetration of several vortices, the Lorentz force which pushes the next vortex in the junction is reduced by the counterflow of vortices already in the LJJ, so the peaks in P(t) caused by penetrating vortices are reduced. As the vortex exits the junction at x = L, it is accelerated again due to attraction to its antivortex image [\cite=MS], producing peaks in P(t).

Now we consider the effect of displacement currents on dynamics of Josephson vortices by first solving the full for moderate damping at α = 0.3 and H = 2H1. The results shown in (b) indicate that in this case vortices gain some inertia and upon reaching the edges dissipate most of their energy, but a small part of it would get reflected in the form of decaying electromagnetic waves back to the junction. For weaker damping (α < 0.1), vortices move with a nearly uniform velocity until they get reflected from the edge of the junction without losing much of their energy but reversing their polarity and velocity[\cite=FD]. As shown in , for α = 0.01 and H = 1.2H1, vortices move almost with their initial velocity but upon reaching the edge of the junction at x = L, they get reflected as anti-vortices. The reflected anti-vortices pass through incoming vortices[\cite=LS] causing only small amount of dissipation. The multiple reflections of vortices from the edges along with continuous pumping of the electromagnetic waves can result in a chaotic behavior of γ(x,t) which we do not address in this work.

Shown in is the averaged power [formula] generated by moving Josephson vortices calculated from at α = 0.2. At high fields

[formula]

Single-mode ac field

In this section we consider a LJJ under a single-mode ac magnetic field, H = Ha sin ωt. In this case it is more convenient to rescale the time in the units of the ac period t  →  ωt, so that the dimensionless sine-Gordon equation takes the form

[formula]

where α  =  ω  /  ωc and β = (ω  /  ωp)2. The boundary conditions become

[formula]

where ha = (4πλλJ  /  φ0)Ha. The instant power is then

[formula]

where P0  =  φ0JcλJω / 2πc.

As was shown above, the plasma frequency for the grain boundaries in Nb is typically in the infrared region (ωp  ~  1012 - 1014 Hz) so for many microwave and rf applications (ω  ~  0.1 - 10 GHz), the parameter β  ≪  α(i.e. ωωc  ≪  ω2p) is negligible and reduces to

[formula]

Our numerical simulations of have shown that it has a solution γ(x,t) with the periodicity of the applied ac field. Shown in are the profiles of magnetic field just before and after penetration of a vortex calculated for α = 0.01. These snapshots of B(x,t) at different times and Ha  ≈  H1 suggest that a vortex (or antivortex during the negative field cycle) get trapped at the edge of the junction, just because vortices under oscillating ac field have limited time to enter the junction. As a result, the threshold field Hp(ω) of vortex penetration becomes larger than H1 and increases with the frequency, so that there is enough time during the part of the period when Ha| sin ωt|  >  H1 for the vortex to penetrate by the distance ~  λJ. Calculations of [formula] given below show that the rf power dissipated in the LJJ increases sharply at Ha > Hp.

Flux dynamics

Unlike the unidirectional flow of vortices under dc field considered in section [\ref=sec:dcfield], the flux dynamics under ac field includes penetration of Josephson vortices during the positive ac cycle followed by penetration of antivortices during the negative cycle and their subsequent annihilation. Shown in are representative examples of the evolution of the local magnetic field B(x,t), and the corresponding instant power P(t) plotted for a full ac cycle calculated from at Ha = 2H1. In the particular case of overdamped flux dynamics shown in (a), about eight vortices penetrate the LJJ during the positive ac cycle, giving rise to small peaks in P(t). Of these vortices, the first three annihilate upon collisions with residual anti-vortices generated during the previous negative half cycle, while the fourth one goes all the way along the junction and exits at the other end. The last four vortices do not reach the end of the junction and turn around as H(t) changes sign; the very last vortex exits before antivortices appear, but three other vortices annihilate on their way back with incoming anti-vortices generated during the negative ac cycle. The same process repeats for antivortices during the negative cycle. Notice that annihilation of vortices and antivortices inside the junction results in peaks in P(t) that are significantly higher than the peaks in P(t) during penetration or exit of vortices at the edges.

(b) shows the effect of displacement currents on the flux dynamics in a moderately overdamped limit at β  ≪  α. We found that if [formula], the response of the junction to the ac field remains periodic and similar to the solutions at β  →  0, except for generation of electromagnetic waves by accelerating/decelerating vortices upon interaction with boundaries and other vortices. As shown in (b), the number of vortices does not change as compared to (a), but because they now have some inertia, two vortices are able to reach the edge and leave behind weak electromagnetic radiation which manifests itself in "ripple" on B(x,t) and a more irregular behavior of P(t).

In the case of β  ~  α shown in vortices quickly enter the junction during the positive ac cycle and move with a nearly uniform velocity until they hit the other edge. There they get reflected from the edge as anti-vortices which then collide with newly entered anti-vortices, giving rise to local spikes of high magnetic field inside the junction before passing through each other and making their trip toward the other edge. In this regime, vortex dynamics is getting more chaotic as depicted in (a); after several reflections, vortices eventually lose their energy due to ohmic losses and exit. (b) illustrates a more chaotic behavior at β  >  α; here vortices undergo more reflections and less dissipation, forming a dynamic pattern in which twice in every ac period, half of the junction is filled with vortices and half with anti-vortices.

Dissipated power

We now calculate the mean dissipated power [formula] in the overdamped limit (β  ≪  α), by averaging over the ac period:

[formula]

where P0  =  φ0JcλJωc / 2πc. Plotted in (a) is [formula] as a function of ac field amplitude for different values of the dimensionless frequency α  =  ω  /  ωc in the overdamped limit. One can clearly see steps in (Ha) due to the change of the mean number of vortices in the junction as Ha increases. For smaller frequencies α, the steps are sharper and decrease in amplitude as Ha increases. As α increases, the sharp steps become broader until they disappear completely and (Ha) quickly becomes quadratic in Ha.

It is instructive to express  / s = RsI2a / 2 in terms of the surface resistance Rs for a stack of parallel LJJ spaced by s along the z-axis, where Ia = cHa / 4π is the amplitude of the ac current flowing through the LJJ. The field dependence of Rs(Ha) = 32π2(Ha) / sc2H2a inferred from the above results for (Ha), is shown in (b). Several features of Rs(Ha) should be mentioned. First, Rs(Ha) increases sharply above a threshold field Hp(ω) which we associate with the field onset of penetration of Josephson vortices in the junction. At small frequencies, α  =  ω  /  ωc  ≪  1, the dependence Rs(Ha) has a significant steplike feature component in which each step results from the change of the mean number of vortices in the LJJ by one as Ha increases. At higher frequencies, the steps Rs(Ha) become less pronounced and disappear at α > 1. For Ha  ≫  H1 the resistance approaches a constant value which, for an infinite LJJ, is just the surface resistance R0 = (2πRiωd)1 / 2 / cs under the normal skin effect [\cite=Mc]. However, in our case of the LJJ of finite length (L = 20λJ), the asymptotic value of Rs(Ha) is smaller than R0. Results similar to those shown in (b) were previously obtained by McDonald and Clem [\cite=Mc] and by Zhai et al. [\cite=Sr]. The frequency dependence of (Ha,ω) at Ha = 4H1 shown in , is close to the square root behavior. The latter is not surprising given that at H = 4H1, the Josephson vortices in the LJJ overlap and Rs(Ha) shown in (b) approaches the surface impedance of a normal conductor.

Frequency dependence of penetration field

The field onset of sharp increase of the dissipated power (Ha) at which the first fluxon penetrates the junction increases with the frequency of the applied field, as it is evident from (a). The calculated frequency dependence of Hp(ω) in the overdamped regime is shown in . Here the function Hp(ω) first increases linearly with ω at ω  ≪  ωc and then exhibits a faster increase with a downward curvature above α  ~  0.1. At ω  ≪  ωc, the penetration field can be approximated by

[formula]

These results show that Hp is close to the dc superheating field of the junction if ω  ≪  ωc.

Asymmetric ac field

In the section [\ref=sec:acfield] we considered a single mode ac field for which the net Lorentz force averaged over the ac period vanishes. Here we consider two situations in which the net force does not vanish, resulting in a preferential drift velocity of vortices. The first case is a dc magnetic field superimposed onto a single-mode ac field, and the second one is a two-mode ac field with different frequencies. In both cases the ac dynamics of vortices can be tuned by either changing the dc field H or the phase shift between the two harmonics.

Ac driven junction biased with a dc field

Dc magnetic field superimposed onto the ac field can result in interesting effects in LJJ which have many applications for HTS thin film junctions[\cite=HLO] [\cite=KS] and flux flow oscillators[\cite=SS] [\cite=KS]. As an illustration, shows the results of calculations in the overdamped limit for α = 0.01, Ha = 2H1 and different dc field values. The main difference from the results of the section [\ref=sec:acfield] is that the positive dc field breaks the symmetry between vortices and antivortices, facilitating penetration of vortices and inhibiting penetration of antivoirtices (and vice versa for negative H). This behavior is clearly seen in . In the limit of H  ≫  Ha, the ac field becomes inessential, and flux dynamics approaches the unidirectional flux flow considered in Section [\ref=sec:dcfield].

Similar to the previous sections, we define the dynamic resistance Rs using the power balance   =  Rs〈I2〉, where the net current I = c(H + Ha sin t) / 4π now contains both dc and ac contributions. Averaging over the ac period gives 〈H2tot〉 = H2 + H2a / 2, so that

[formula]

Shown in are the curves Rs(Ha) / R0 calculated for α = 0.1 and different values of H. One can see that the dc field reduces the field threshold of vortex penetration Hp(H) which is now controlled by the maximum instantaneous field value H + Ha. Thus, we have Hp(H) = H1 - H if H < H1 and ω  ≪  ωc. The resistance at H > H1 and Ha  ≪  H reduces to the resistance R for the unidirectional flux flow shown in . We do not consider here a moderately dissipative case β  ~  α for which the resistance Rs in superimposed dc and ac fields can become negative [\cite=negr].

Bi-harmonic field and the ac ratchet effect

It is well-known that a particle driven by an external force in a periodic potential without reflection symmetry can move with a mean drift velocity vd due to the dc ratchet effect. This situation can occur in a LJJ as well if the Josephson vortex is driven by superimposed dc and ac currents [\cite=negr] or by a periodic ac force containing more than one harmonics so that vd depends on the phase shift θ between two harmonics with different frequencies [\cite=ratj1] [\cite=ratj2] [\cite=ratj3]. The dc and ac ratchet effects, and the related issues of the Brownian motors [\cite=HL] [\cite=GV] have been investigated in biological systems [\cite=GV], particle separation [\cite=GV] [\cite=MM], and vortex motion rectification in superconductors [\cite=JS] [\cite=SF1] [\cite=SF2] [\cite=ratdc].

To see how the dynamic ratchet effect can manifest itself in the LJJ geometry shown in , we consider a Josephson vortex driven by a uniform bi-harmonic current density J(t) = J1 cos ωt + J2 cos (2ωt + θ), where θ is a constant phase shift. We start with a simple model in which the vortex is treated as a particle subject to the ac Lorentz force, so that the velocity of the vortex v(t) is described by the dynamic equation,

[formula]

where M is the effective vortex mass, η is the viscous drag coefficient [\cite=KL] [\cite=BP], and the term v2 / v20 describes the first nonlinear correction to the vortex viscosity [\cite=KL] [\cite=MS] [\cite=LS]. We seek the solution of in the form:

[formula]

where vd is a dc drift velocity, and vi(t) is a periodic function which contains higher order harmonics. If v(t)  ≪  v0, the nonlinear term in is small, so that vd can be calculated in a perturbation theory [\cite=GV] by averaging over the ac period:

[formula]

Here 〈v3〉 was calculated from neglecting the higher order harmonics vi(t). In the low-frequency overdamped limit ω  ≪  η / M, the mass term in can be neglected and the linearized equations v(t) = φ0J(t) / η for the first and the second harmonics yield v1  =  φ0J1  /  η and v2  =  φ0J2  /  η. Then reduces to:

[formula]

This relation shows that the drift velocity can be changed by varying the phase shift θ to make the vortex move either to the left or to the right. The case of two superimposed modes thus appears qualitatively similar to the case of superimposed dc and ac fields considered above because penetration of vortices can be either facilitated or inhibited by varying the phase shift θ [\cite=ratj1] [\cite=ratj2] [\cite=ratj3]. The case of bi-harmonic rf field can model grain boundaries in superconducting resonator cavities in which several resonance electromagnetic modes can be generated [\cite=cav].

We now solve the overdamped sine-Gordon equation for a bi-harmonic field, H(t) = Ha1 sin ωt + Ha2 sin (mωt + θ) and the boundary conditions,

[formula]

where [formula] and m is integer.

In the overdamped limit the solutions for γ(x,t) have the same periodicity as H(t). For even m, the ratio of the mean numbers of fluxons and antifluxons can be tuned by varying θ, which was observed in Ref. [\cite=SF1] [\cite=SF2]. For instance, as (a) shows, increasing θ from 0 to 2π / 3 inhibits penetration of vortices and facilitates penetration of anti-vortices into the junction. For odd values of m, the field satisfies the condition H(t + T / 2) =  - H(t) so the change of θ does not result in the vortex/antivortex imbalance, although flux dynamics is affected by θ. As an example, (b) shows that varying θ from 0 to 2π / 3 affects the dynamics of B(x,t) symmetrically for both fluxons and anti-fluxons.

shows how the dissipated power can be tuned by varying Ha2 and θ for the fixed amplitude of the first harmonic, Ha1. For m = 2, the power [formula] generally increases with Ha2 but the change of θ from 0 to π / 2 results in humps and dips on the curve of (Ha2) at Ha2  ≈  H1 / 2 and Ha2  ≈  1.8H1. For m = 3, the dips in (Ha2) are less pronounced but still apparent at Ha2  ≈  0.8H1 and θ  =  π / 2. In both cases changing θ from 0 to π / 2 can reduce (Ha2) in certain regions of Ha2 while increasing (Ha2) in others.

The dependencies of (θ) for m = 2 and m = 3, at a fixed field amplitude (H2a1 + H2a2)1 / 2 = 3H1 and different values of Ha2 are shown in (a) and (b). Here (θ) can vary rapidly with θ, although the maximum change of (θ) does not exceed 10%. Interestingly, the most pronounced reduction of (θ) in the suitable ranges of θ occurs if the amplitude of the second harmonics is small as compared to Ha1.

Discussion

The results of this work show that the electromagnetic response of a long but finite Josephson junctions in ac magnetic fields can be quite complicated due to penetration, oscillation and annihilation of Josephson vortices. The nonlinear dynamics of Josephson vortices results in essential dependencies of the averaged dissipated power [formula] and the dynamic resistance R on the field amplitude. Here (H) and R(H) can have steps and peaks due to the change of the number of trapped vortices in the junction as H increases. The calculated field dependence of the surface resistance R(H) is far from linear, inconsistent with the model assumptions of previous works [\cite=gbi4] [\cite=gbi5]. It is important to point out that (H) is obtained by averaging the instant power P(t,H) over the ac period during which P(t) has strong spikes due to annihilation of vortices and antivortices in the junction, the magnitude of these power spikes can be much higher than the smooth background contribution to P(t). In high-Jc Josephson junctions these power spikes may trigger thermo-magnetic instabilities in the rf field [\cite=ap].

The penetration of Josephson vortices occurs above the threshold field Hp(ω) at which the dissipated power increases significantly. If the local Jc at the edge of the junction is not reduced by materials defects, the dynamic penetration field Hp(ω) remains close to the dc Josephson superheating field of the Meissner state H1  =  φ0 / 2πλλJ if ω  /  ωc  ≪  1. The characteristic frequency ωc in is proportional to the product JcRi, so the frequency dependence of Hp(ω) is most pronounced for low-Jc and low resistance junctions. The estimates given above show that for the grain boundaries in Nb, the frequency-dependent correction in Hp(ω) is small for ω  <  Δ  /  , where Δ is the superconducting gap.

As was mentioned in the introduction, a LJJ of finite length can model the electromagnetic response of grain boundaries in polycrystalline superconductors. The grain boundaries in Nb resonator cavities appear to be strongly coupled and do not behave as the conventional Josephson junctions up to very high magnetic fields at which densities of screening current become of the order of the depairing current density. As a result, the field onset of penetration of mixed Abrikosov-Josephson vortices [\cite=nje1] [\cite=nje2] [\cite=nje3] is close to the lower critical field of intra-grain vortices Hc1≃170 mT. By contrast, the grain boundaries in Nb3Sn, iron-based superconductors or high-Tc cuprates do behave as Josephson weak links [\cite=GB] [\cite=DG], so one can expect that the nonlinear effects addressed in this paper can manifest themselves in the surface impedance at rather low fields H≃H1 < Hc1. Such effects can also be essential for the rf performance of polycrystalline multilayer screens which were suggested to enhance the breakdown field of Nb resonator cavities [\cite=ml].
