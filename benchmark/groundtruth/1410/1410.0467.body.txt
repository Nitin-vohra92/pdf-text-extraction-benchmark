A fractional Helly theorem for boxes

Introduction and results

According to the classical theorem of Helly [\cite=DGK], if every d + 1-element subfamily of a finite family of convex sets in [formula] has nonempty intersection, then the entire family has nonempty intersection. Although the number d + 1 in Helly's theorem cannot be lowered in general, it can be reduced for some special families of convex sets. For example, if any two elements in a finite family of axis-parallel boxes in [formula] intersect, then all members of the family intersect, cf. [\cite=DG].

Katchalski and Liu [\cite=KL1979] proved the following generalization of Helly's theorem for the case when not all but only a fraction of d + 1-element subfamilies have a nonempty intersection in a family of convex sets.

The bound on the size of the intersecting subfamily was later improved by Kalai [\cite=K] from [formula] to (1 - (1 - α)1 / (d + 1))n, and this bound is best possible.

In this paper, we study the fractional behaviour of finite families of axis-parallel boxes, or boxes for short. We note that the boxes can be either open or closed, our statements hold for both cases. Our aim is to prove a statement similar to the Fractional Helly Theorem.

The intersection graph GF of a finite family F of boxes is a graph whose vertex set is the set of elements of F, and two vertices are connected by an edge in GF precisely when the corresponding boxes in F have nonempty intersection.

Recall that for two integers n  ≥  m  ≥  1, the Turán-graph T(n,m) is a complete m-partite graph on n vertices in which the cardinalities of the m vertex classes are as close to each other as possible. Let t(n,m) denote the number of edges of the Turán graph T(n,m). It is known that [formula], and equality holds if m divides n. Furthermore,

[formula]

For more information on the properties of Turán graphs see, for example, the book of Diestel [\cite=Diestel2010].

The following example shows that we cannot hope for a statement for boxes that is completely analogous to the Fractional Helly Theorem.

Let n  ≥  d + 1 and m,k  ≥  0 be integers such that n = md + k and 0  ≤  k  ≤  d - 1. Let [formula] be positive integers with [formula] and [formula] for 1  ≤  i  ≤  k and [formula] for k + 1  ≤  i  ≤  d. For 1  ≤  i  ≤  d, consider ni - 1 hyperplanes orthogonal to the ith coordinate direction. These hyperplanes cut [formula] into ni pairwise disjoint open slabs [formula]. Let C be a large open axis-parallel box that intersects each slab and let Fi consist of the open boxes [formula]. Define F as the union of the Fi.

This way we have obtained a family F of n boxes with the property that two elements of F intersect exactly if they belong to different Fi. The intersection graph of F is T(n,d) and thus the number of intersecting pairs in F is t(n,d). However, there is no point of [formula] that belongs to any d + 1-element subfamily of F. Thus, [\eqref=turangraph] shows that in a fractional Helly-type statement for boxes, the percentage α has to be greater than [formula].

Let n  ≥  k  ≥  d and let T(n,k,d) denote the maximal number of intersecting pairs in a family F of n boxes in [formula] with the property that no k + 1 boxes in F have a point in common.

With the above notation,

It is quite easy to precisely determine T(n,k,d) when d = 1:

[formula].

Theorem [\ref=turanindex] directly implies the following corollary.

Assume that ε > 0 is a real number and F is a family of n boxes in [formula]. If at least [formula] pairs of F intersect, then F contains an intersecting subfamily of size [formula].

The proof of Corollary [\ref=thm:frac-boxes] is given in Subsection 2.2. Corollary [\ref=thm:frac-boxes] yields the next theorem, which is our main result.

Kalai's lower bound β(α) = 1 - (1 - α)1 / (d + 1) for the size of the intersecting subfamily in the fractional Helly theorem yields that if α  →  1, then β(α)  →  1 as well. The same holds for families of parallel boxes as stated in the following theorem.

Let F be a family of n boxes in [formula], and let [formula] be a real number. If at least α pairs of boxes in F intersect, then there exists a point that belongs to at least [formula] elements of F.

Simple calculations show that Corollary [\ref=thm:frac-boxes] does not imply Theorem [\ref=thm:limit] so we provide a separate proof for it in Section 2.

Proofs

Proof of Theorem [\ref=turanindex]

It is enough to prove that if no k + 1 elements of F have a point in common, then there are at least [formula] non-intersecting pairs. We may assume by standard arguments that the boxes in F are all open, so B∈F is of the form [formula]. We assume without loss of generality that all numbers ai(B),bi(B) (B∈F) are distinct. For B∈F we define deg B to be the number of boxes in F that intersect B.

We prove Theorem [\ref=turanindex] by induction on n. The starting case n = k is simple since then [formula]. In the induction step n - 1  →  n we consider two cases.

Proof of Corollary [\ref=thm:frac-boxes]

If no point of [formula] belongs to [formula] elements of F, then by Theorem [\ref=turanindex] the number of intersecting pairs of F is smaller than

[formula]

which yields a contradiction.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:limit]

Let πi denote the orthogonal projection to the ith dimension in [formula], that is, πi(B) = (ai(B),bi(B)) for B∈F. Set ε = 1 - α. Define Ti  =  {πi(B):B∈F}; this is a family of n intervals, and all but at most [formula] of the pairs in Ti intersect. According to the sharp version of the fractional Helly theorem (cf. [\cite=K]), Ti contains an intersecting subfamily [formula] of size [formula], let ci be a common point of all the intervals in [formula]. Define Di  =  {B∈F:ci∉πi(B)}. Then [formula] consists of at least [formula] boxes and all of them contain the point [formula].

Proof of Proposition [\ref=intervals]

Let [formula] be an integer, and let F be the family of open intervals (i,i + k) for [formula]. Thus F consists of n intervals, no k + 1 of them have a point in common, and there are [formula] intersecting pairs in F. Consequently [formula].

Next we show, by induction on n that [formula]. Let F be a family of n intervals such that no k + 1 of them have a common point. We assume that these intervals are closed which is no loss of generality. The statement is clearly true when n = k. Let ∈F be the interval where b is minimal. Since any interval intersecting
