Nonstandard Quartic Self Interactions of Electroweak Vector Bosons within a Gauge InvariantHigher-Derivative Term

Universität Bielefeld Fakultät für Physik33501 BielefeldGermany

Effective (nonstandard) interactions among the electroweak vector bosons W±, Z and γ have been investigated very intensively with respect to experimental tests of the vector-boson self-interactions in future collider experiments (LEP II, NLC, LHC).

In recent works the nonstandard self couplings are parametrized through SU(2)L  ×  U(1)Y gauge invariant Lagrangians with linearly realized symmetry [\cite=llr] [\cite=buwy] [\cite=ruj] [\cite=haze1] [\cite=haze2] [\cite=gkks], i.e. effective Lagrangians of the type

[formula]

where LSM is the (dimension-four) standard-model Lagrangian and the L(n)i are locally SU(2)L  ×  U(1)Y -invariant effective interaction terms of (higher) dimension n. Λ is the scale of the assumed new physics beyond the effective theory and the ε(n)i are coupling constants. Usually one considers only dimension-six terms because terms of higher dimension are suppressed by higher negative powers of Λ.

The complete list of dimension-six effective interaction terms is given in [\cite=llr]. These terms can be classified in three cathegories:

Terms which contain fermionic couplings or two-gauge-boson interactions. These affect four-fermion amplitudes at the tree level and thus would imply strong deviations of LEP I results from the standard-model predictions. Therefore the empirical limits on the coupling constants of these terms are very strict [\cite=ruj] [\cite=haze2] [\cite=gkks] [\cite=grwi].

Terms that contain nonstandard gauge boson self-interactions but no fermionic couplings or two-gauge-boson couplings. These terms affect LEP I observables only indirectly through loop effects. However, as a consequence of the linearly realized gauge invariance, the loop contributions of such (nonrenormalizable) effective interactions to observable quantities are very small; they depend only logarithmically on the cut-off Λ [\cite=ruj] [\cite=haze1] [\cite=haze2]. This means that the indirect bounds on the corresponding coupling constants that can be deduced from LEP I results are not very strict [\cite=ruj] [\cite=haze1] [\cite=haze2]. The vector-boson self-interactions contained in these terms thus have to be tested directly in future experiments in which vector bosons are produced.

Terms which contain neither fermionic couplings nor gauge-boson self-interactions. They only yield nonstandard interactions involving the Higgs boson. These terms are not ruled out from LEP I data, too, however they are also not very interesting with respect to tests of the vector-boson self-interactions.

There is one dimension-six term that belongs to the second cathegory and which has not been considered in the literature so far, namely the term

[formula]

In ([\ref=ldd]) the following notation is used:

[formula]

with v being the vacuum expectation value of the scalar fields, H the Higgs field, φi the pseudo-Goldstone fields and Wμi and Bμ the gauge fields. In this paper I will discuss the term LDD; i.e. I will investigate the effective Lagrangian

[formula]

First one notes that the term ([\ref=ldd]) contains higher derivatives of the scalar fields. It is well known that higher-order Lagrangians, in general, imply unphysical effects (unphysical degrees of freedom, unbound energy from below, no analytic limit for ε  →  0) [\cite=hide]. However, these unphysical effects are absent if an effective higher-order Lagrangian is considerd [\cite=high], i.e. a Lagrangian which is assumed to be the low-energy approximation of "new physics". In this case, a higher-order Lagrangian can formally be treated like a first-order one, especially the Feynman rules can be obtained in the usual way from the effective Lagrangian [\cite=high] [\cite=hle]. Other dimension-six terms with higher derivatives that, however, effect LEP I observables at the tree level have been examined in [\cite=grwi].

Like any effective interaction term with higher derivatives, ([\ref=ldd]) can be rewritten as a (physically equivalent) term without higher derivatives by applying the standard-model equations of motion [\cite=high]. (Actually, such an application of the equations of motion corresponds to a field transformation [\cite=eom] which becomes a canonical transformation within the Hamiltonian formalism for higher-order Lagrangians [\cite=high].) However, for practical calculations such a reduction is not very useful, because then a term like ([\ref=ldd]) becomes a complicated expression from which the physical interpretation of this term is not very obvious. (See [\cite=ruj] [\cite=gkks] for examples.) It is more convenient to examine the term ([\ref=ldd]) in its simple form with higher derivatives given above.

The above statement that LDD has no tree-level effects on four-fermion amplitudes is not strictly correct because the effective Lagrangian ([\ref=leffdd]) contains a term

[formula]

which affects the propagators of the massive gauge bosons. These become in the unitary gauge (φi = 0)

[formula]

However, if one considers Feynman graphs with a virtual gauge-boson that is coupled to light fermions with mass mf, the deviations of the corresponding amplitudes from the standard model induced by the propagator ([\ref=wprop]) are proportional to

[formula]

and thus negligible. Therefore the term LDD has de facto no tree-level effect on LEP I observables and thus it cannot be ruled out due to present empirical data. It should be noted that the propagator ([\ref=wprop]) contains in addition to the pole at p2 = M2B another pole at [formula] which could be interpreted as the effect of heavy particles connected with the assumed new physics beyond the effective Lagrangian ([\ref=leffdd]). Similarly, the Higgs propagator deriving from ([\ref=leffdd])

[formula]

has poles for p2 = M2H + O(Λ- 2) and for [formula].

One can easily see that ([\ref=leffdd]) contains no nonstandard cubic gauge-boson self-interactions but the quartic interaction term

[formula]

This means that (within gauge invariant dimension-six extensions of the standard model) the absence of nonstandard cubic interactions among the vector bosons does not imply standard quartic couplings, i.e. also the quartic couplings have to be tested in experiments in order to verify the standard model. Nonstandard quartic couplings can be implied by the assumed new physics beyond the effective theory through the exchange of a heavy particle.

Anomalous quartic vector-boson self-interactions that are independent of the cubic self interactions have been examined (within gauge noninvariant models) in [\cite=kmss] [\cite=bebo]. If one requires custodial SU(2) symmetry (i.e. global SU(2) symmetry in the absence of the Bμ field), electromagnetic gauge invariance and the absence of derivatives one can construct two effective quartic interaction terms [\cite=kmss] [\cite=bebo], namely ([\ref=quart]) and

[formula]

However, considering gauge invariant extensions of the standard model, there is an important difference between these expressions: ([\ref=quart]) can be emdedded in a gauge invariant dimension-six term that does not affect LEP I observables at the tree level but ([\ref=quart2]) cannot. Actually, ([\ref=quart2]) is contained in the term

[formula]

which, however, can be expressed through LDD ([\ref=ldd]) (after dropping total derivative terms) according to

[formula]

The additional terms in ([\ref=rel]) are

[formula]

(with the notation ([\ref=not])). These terms have been examined elsewhere [\cite=ruj] [\cite=haze1] [\cite=haze2] [\cite=gkks]. LWΦ, LBΦ, LWW and LBB have no tree-level effects on four-fermion amplitudes (LWΦ and LBΦ contain nonstandard cubic and quartic vector-boson self-interactions, LWW and LBB yield after a redefinition of the gauge fields and of the coupling constants only nonstandard couplings of the Higgs field), but LWB contains a W3B-mixing term which affects LEP I observables at the tree level. Thus, in distinction to LDD ([\ref=ldd]), LDD,2 ([\ref=ldd2]) contradicts LEP I results. (However, both expressions, ([\ref=quart]) and ([\ref=quart2]), can be embedded in dimension-eight terms that have no tree-level effects on LEP I observables [\cite=gkks].)

Since LDD does not contain cubic vector-boson self-interactions it even has no tree-level effects on the process e+e-  →  W+W- to be measured at LEP II or NLC. However it will yield contributions to three-gauge-boson production in e+e- collisions at NLC [\cite=bebo] [\cite=www] [\cite=gksch] and to vector-boson scattering, which can be realized by scattering vector bosons emitted by quarks in pp collisions at LHC [\cite=wws] [\cite=wwns]. These processes can be used as experimental tests of the quartic vector-boson self-interactions. The corresponding amplitudes also get direct contributions from Higgs-exchange diagrams. Therefore one has to consider the nonstandard couplings of the Higgs field to the gauge fields contained in ([\ref=leffdd]), as well. Here I list the additional vector-vector-Higgs couplings in the unitary gauge (φi = 0):

[formula]

Finally it should be noted that an effective gauge theory with the same vector-boson self-interactions as ([\ref=leffdd]) but without a physical Higgs boson can be constructed by formally taking the limit MH  →    ∞  , i.e. by replacing [\cite=apbe] [\cite=gkko]

[formula]

in ([\ref=leffdd]). The resulting (chiral) Lagrangian, however, contains nonpolynonial interactions of the unphysical scalar fields.

In summary: The term LDD ([\ref=ldd]) should necessarily be taken into account when investigating gauge invariant dimension-six extensions of the electroweak standard model. The fact that this term contains higher derivatives does not imply any unphysical effects. LDD is the only dimension-six term which contains nonstandard quartic vector-boson self-interactions but no cubic ones without having tree-level effects on presently measurable quantities. These nonstandard quartic couplings have to be tested in future experiments.
