Computing the Slope of the Isgur-Wise Function

The ARGUS [\cite=argus] and CLEO [\cite=cleo] collaborations study the semi-leptonic decays B  →  D*l, and present results for |Vcb|ξ(ω), where ξ(ω) is the Isgur-Wise function [\cite=iw], ω is the dot product of the four-velocities of the B and D* mesons (ω  =  vB  ·  vD*), and Vcb is the cb element of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix. The presentation of the results in this form is suggested by the "Heavy Quark Effective Theory" (HQET) (for a comprehensive review and references to the original literature see ref.[\cite=neubert]). The Isgur-Wise function is normalised to 1 at the zero recoil point, i.e. ξ(1) = 1, so the extraction of the Vcb matrix element requires an extrapolation of the experimental results from ω  >  1 to ω = 1 . This extrapolation requires a model function or a theoretical prediction as a guide. Recently, the first lattice computations of ξ(ω) have been performed (for discrete values of ω > 1 [\cite=bss] [\cite=ukqcd], and have been used to extrapolate the experimental data to ω = 1, and hence to determine Vcb. In this letter we point out that it is also possible to compute directly the slope of the Isgur-Wise function at the zero-recoil point ([formula]), as well as some higher derivatives.

The calculations suggested in this letter complement those already proposed in ref.[\cite=ugo1]. In ref.[\cite=ugo1] the procedure for computing the slope directly in the HQET was explained. Here we discuss the computation for QCD, i.e. for heavy quarks with a finite mass. The advantage of using quarks with a finite mass is that there is no uncertainty in the normalisation of the lattice operators used to compute the slope and higher derivatives, in contrast with the situation in the HQET [\cite=gimenez]. Moreover the derivatives are computed in terms of ratios of correlation functions, and it is likely that there will be some cancellation of systematic errors and statistical fluctuations in these ratios.

In order to determine the Isgur-Wise function it is convenient to evaluate the elastic matrix element [formula], where P(p) represents a pseudoscalar meson of mass m, consisting of a heavy quark Q and a light antiquark. This matrix element can be parametrised by a single form-factor f(q2) defined by

[formula]

where [formula] and q2 = 2m2(1 - ω). The Isgur-Wise function, ξ(ω) is given by

[formula]

where β(ω) represents radiative corrections which will be discussed later (β(1) = 0 for the degenerate case we are considering here), and we neglect corrections of O(1 / m).

The derivatives of the Isgur-Wise function at the zero recoil point can be expressed in terms of the derivatives of Mμ w.r.t. the momentum p as will be explained below (in the following we will take μ = 4, which is a convenient choice). For simplicity consider the case where [formula] and p = (p0,0,0,p3), with [formula] , so that M4 is a function of p23. The derivatives of M4(p23) w.r.t. p23 are as follows:

[formula]

and similarly for the higher derivatives , where the [formula]'s on [formula] denote derivatives w.r.t. ω.

[formula] and [formula] can be obtained from suitable combinations of two- and three-point correlation functions and their derivatives. Let us consider:

[formula]

and

[formula]

where JP ([formula]) is an interpolating operator which can annihilate (create) the heavy-light pseudoscalar meson P, and V4 represents the fourth component of the vector current ZVγμQ . ZV is the renormalisation constant relating the lattice vector current to the physical one. Z = |〈0|JP(0)|P〉| and the ellipses in eqs.([\ref=eq:c2asym]) and ([\ref=eq:c3asym]) represent terms which are exponentially suppressed at large time separations, i.e. when tx and tw - tx are both large. We assume that we can study the correlation functions at sufficiently large separations to neglect these terms.

In eqs.([\ref=eq:c2def])-([\ref=eq:c3asym]) we have implicitly assumed that the interpolating operators JP are local, so that the corresponding matrix elements Z are independent of p3. In many simulations this is not the case, extended interpolating operators are used to increase the overlap with the ground state and the corresponding Z's depend on momentum. For the sake of clarity we start our discussion assuming local interpolating operators, and generalise the results to extended operators towards the end of this letter.

We expand the correlation functions as power series in p3:

[formula]

where

[formula]

On a periodic lattice we propose taking x23  =   min {x23,(L3 - x3)2}, where L3 is the length of the lattice in the z-direction, and similarly x43  =   min {x43,(L3 - x3)4}. The derivatives of the Isgur-Wise function at the zero recoil point are given simply in terms of the ratios [formula] (where we have suppressed the time labels tx and tw):

[formula]

Since [formula] and [formula] are obtained from ratios of correlation functions, it is not necessary to know the normalisation constant ZV .

In order to obtain the derivatives of the renormalisation group invariant Isgur-Wise function ξ(ω) (defined in detail in ref.[\cite=neubertprd]) from the results for [formula] and [formula], it is necessary to evaluate the derivatives of β(ω), the radiative corrections in eq.([\ref=eq:xidef]). This is a calculation in continuum perturbation theory, although the results depend on the mass of the heavy quark being used in the simulations. The ingredients necessary to perform the evaluation of [formula] and [formula] for elastic matrix elements are presented in the appendix of ref.[\cite=neubertprd]. In the recent simulation by the UKQCD collaboration mQ was about 1.36 GeV [\cite=ukqcd], for which, taking [formula] GeV, we find [formula] and [formula] (for nf = 3, where nf is the number of quark flavours in the evolution equations, however the dependence on the nf is mild, e.g. the results are -0.23 and 0.17 for nf = 0). Having obtained the derivatives of ξ(ω) at the zero recoil point, it is possible to obtain those of the form-factors for B  →  D and D* semi-leptonic decays by using continuum perturbation theory and the heavy quark symmetry[\cite=neubertprd].

The discussion in this letter can readily be generalised to computations which use extended interpolating operators. In this case the matrix elements Z become functions of p23. Expanding Z(p23) as a power series in p23,

[formula]

we define [formula]. Equations ([\ref=eq:xip]) and ([\ref=eq:xipp]) become modified to

[formula]

Thus in order to obtain the derivatives of the Isgur-Wise function using extended interpolating operators we need to determine R(2)Z and R(4)Z. This is done by fitting R(2)2 and R(4)2 as functions of tx:

[formula]

and

[formula]

In this letter we have proposed a method for the direct determination of the slope and higher derivatives of the Isgur-Wise function at the zero recoil point. We expect that this technique, particularly when combined with standard lattice determinations of ξ(ω), for discrete values of ω > 1, will provide a valuable tool for the extrapolation of experimental results to ω = 1, and hence will lead to a more precise determination of Vcb. The method can also be generalised to other decays, such as the semileptonic decays of heavy baryons.
