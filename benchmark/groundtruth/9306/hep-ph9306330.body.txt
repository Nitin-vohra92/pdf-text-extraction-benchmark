Enhancing the Higgs signal in [formula] and Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242

18pt plus 0.2pt minus 0.1pt There are many methods suggested for detecting a Higgs particle of mass above 400 GeV at the SSC. The cleanest method by far is searching for a resonance in the invariant mass distribution of the four final state leptons in the 'gold-plated' decay [formula]. However, due to the small branching fraction for Z decaying to charged leptons, the number of events is not expected to be large given the design luminosity of the accelerator, and so there is a possibility that a heavy Higgs could escape detection because of low statistics. With this in mind it was suggested[\cite=Cahn] that the mode [formula] be considered since the cross section is a factor of six higher.

The signature for these events is a pair of charged leptons with invariant mass mZ, and a transverse momentum imbalance ascribed to the neutrinos. The kinematic variable used to characterize the cross section is the transverse mass,

[formula]

In Fig. 1 we plot the differential cross sections for pp  →  ZZ as a function of the invariant mass of the Z pair, and as a function of the transverse mass. What is clear from these figures is that the Higgs is more pronounced in the transverse mass distribution. This is because in the LAB frame the heavy Higgs is produced with very little momentum and then decays isotropically. In contrast the Z pairs from the continuum are forward directed. Thus any uncertainty in the continuum (due to QCD corrections and any other parton processes contributing to the final result) will have less of an effect on a transverse mass plot than on an invariant mass plot.

Unfortunately, in the case of [formula] there are QCD background processes[\cite=Cahnetal] which mimic the final state. At the partonic level they come from q  →  Zg and qg  →  qZ where some final state hadrons disappear down the beam pipe. In order to remove this background it is necessary to impose some stringent kinematic cuts. This reduces the total number of events to around 50, and we are again facing the problem of statistics. It is for this reason that people have been seeking methods of enhancing the Higgs signal by using as much of the information from the events as possible. One such method currently under investigation is that of tagging the jets[\cite=jettag] arising from the scattered hard partons. With appropriate cuts this effectively reduces the background to pp  →  H  →  ZZ.

In this report we would like to suggest another method which can either complement or supplement other methods of enhancement. It relies on the fact that in Higgs decay, as seen in its rest frame, the Zs are predominantly longitudinally polarized whereas all other processes yield transversely polarized Zs. By extracting as much information about the production polarization of a Z from the angular distribution of its decay to the final state charged leptons it should be possible to enhance the Higgs signal. As we shall see there is a kinematic variable available to us in the LAB frame which allows us to do just that.

In the Z pair center of mass frame we can define the fraction of Zs that are longitudinally polarized,

[formula]

where the subscripts refer to the polarizations of the Z pair. In Fig. 2 we plot this as a function of mZZ and mT for two different Higgs masses. As we can see there is a larger area under the curve when plotted against the transverse mass for the same reasons as discussed above.

It is important to stress that this variable can only be extracted from the data if we can reconstruct the ZZ center of mass frame. This is because back-to-back Zs have a common axis for the measurement of their spin. Consider one of the Zs in this frame and boost back along its direction of motion to its rest frame. The longitudinal polarization vector in this 'decay' frame is [formula] where [formula] is a unit vector pointing along the original direction of motion. In the ZZ frame its components would be [formula] given by a simple boost from the decay to ZZ frame. In the decay frame the leptons will be back-to-back. The angle between a lepton momentum and the unit vector is given by,

[formula]

as depicted in Fig. 3. The distribution of this angle depends on the polarization of the decaying Z,

[formula]

If we can determine this angle then its distribution will yield an estimate for fL. This is an approach which has been adopted before for WW final states[\cite=DKR], and for the gold-plated mode[\cite=Duncan].

However, as we are considering one of the Zs decaying invisibly to neutrinos we cannot reconstruct the ZZ center of mass frame. Thus we cannot boost all our four-momenta from the LAB to the ZZ frame and thence to the decay frame to define sμL. What one means by polarization is frame dependent and so fL and z cannot be extracted from the data. Nevertheless, we can construct the longitudinal polarization vector in the LAB frame given the reconstructed four-momentum of the decaying Z,

[formula]

Given this, we can define a new kinematic variable in the LAB frame,

[formula]

This will only equal z when the ZZ and LAB frames coincide i.e. when [formula] and rapidity y = 0. However, since a heavy Higgs is expected to be produced almost at rest then [formula] ought to be close to z when we are sitting on the resonance.

In Fig. 4 we plot some typical [formula] distributions close to and far from a resonance. We see that in the former the distribution seems to have a lot of φL in it whilst the latter has more φT. Nevertheless, these are not sufficiently noise-free to extract a value for [formula] with small enough errors by fitting to [formula]. It is much more propitious to take such data and estimate the average [formula], as this should smooth out the noise a little. This should also be of benefit if there is an error in [formula] arising from detector resolution. Theoretically we know that [formula] falls in the range,

[formula]

the lower bound being for purely longitudinal Z and the upper for purely transverse Z. In Fig. 5 we plot [formula] for different values of the Higgs mass. We now turn to the question of error bars.

The results presented here are preliminary. So far we have only concentrated on the q  →  ZZ continuum for the background and the gg  →  H  →  ZZ for the signal. We have yet to incorporate the hard QCD background and vector boson scattering for the signal. The processes we have considered so far balance transverse momentum. The vector boson scattering qq  →  qqVV  →  qqZZ will not and will have some effect on the distribution of [formula]. This is currently under investigation and shall report on the results soon. To get a sense of whether this enhancement method will ultimately be of use we have plotted [formula] for two different Higgs masses in Fig. 6. The horizontal error bars are the mT binning whilst the vertical are estimated by varying the continuum background by ±  30%. We see that the continuum uncertainty does not much effect [formula]. This gives us hope.

The central idea of this report is that the polarization information from the decay of the Z to charged leptons can be used to help enhance the signal over the background. We may use this information to allow us to relax the cuts on other kinematic variables such as rapidity, transverse momenta, etc. Doing so should leave us with a larger sample of events and thus better statistics, particularly at higher masses. Thus by extracting as much from the data as possible we can overcome the limitations of a paucity of events.
