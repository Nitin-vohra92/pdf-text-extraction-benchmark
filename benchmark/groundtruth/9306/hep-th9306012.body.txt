Abstract

The 2D lattice gauge theory with a quantum gauge group SLq(2) is considered. When [formula], its weak coupling partition function coincides with the one of the G/G coset model ( i.e. equals the Verlinde numbers). However, despite such a remarkable coincidence, these models are not equivalent but, in some certain sense, dual to each other.

The necessity of a regularization in quantum field theories naturally leads to their lattice formulation. In the context of gauge theory, lattice models [\cite=Wilson] play a rather fundamental role of its non-perturbative definition. Within the strong coupling expansion, lattice QCD gives some evidence for the confinement phenomenon. In topological theories, the lattice formulation is extremely useful since it establishes a direct connection with invariants of different types of complexes. For example, in order to calculate the partition function in a topological theory, we can, in principle, consider the simplest cell decomposition of a base manifold. An implementation of such ideology was given in ref. [\cite=Boul] (see also [\cite=Boul1]), where the notion of q-deformed 3D lattice gauge theory (qQCQ3) was introduced and shown to be connected with the Turaev-Viro (and, hence, Chern-Simons) invariant.

The aim of the present paper is to apply the general approach of ref. [\cite=Boul] to the 2D lattice gauge theory with a compact quantum gauge group (qQCD2). As will be shown, for the SLq(N), qn   =   1, gauge group, its weak coupling limit gives a well defined topological gauge model on an arbitrary cell decomposition of a 2D manifold. In the case |q| < 1, we obtain q-analogs of all classical () quantities without changing the nature of the model qualitatively. QCD2 itself has recently drawn attention because of the new insights brought about by the Gross-Taylor reinterpretation of its partition function as the sum over branched coverings [\cite=Gross]. The topological nature of QCD2 was noticed long ago by A.A.Migdal [\cite=Mig] who proposed to use a character expansion of Boltzman weights to manifest it. Following this guideline, the partition function of QCD2 on an arbitrary 2-manifold was obtained in the form of a sum over irreps of a gauge group in ref. [\cite=Rus1]. Recently, on the sphere, the third order phase transition with respect to the area was found [\cite=DougKaz] (see also [\cite=Rus2], where the partition function for small areas was calculated). Wilson loop averages were investigated in refs. [\cite=KazKos]. In the qQCD2 case, one should distinguish between over and under-crossings of Wilson lines obtaining in this way a connection with the knot invariants.

However, QCD2 is not the only 2D theory possessing a gauge symmetry. Another well-known example is the gauged WZW model [\cite=Gaw]. In ref. [\cite=Witt] [\cite=Spieg] the topological G/G coset model was suggested, which was investigated then from various viewpoints in refs. [\cite=Yank]. Its partition function is given by the number of conformal blocks in the WZW model on a corresponding manifold [\cite=Witt]. These numbers were calculated by E.Verlinde in ref. [\cite=Verl]. In the present paper, we show that the quantum group structure of the Verlinde numbers naturally appears in the framework of lattice gauge theory. However, amplitudes in the G/G model have no natural representation in qQCD2, and so do observables in the latter. We shall argue that these two models are actually dual to each other.

The partition function in qQCD2 can be defined in close analogy with the standard (classical) lattice gauge model [\cite=Wilson] [\cite=Mig]. Let L be an arbitrary 2D lattice, i.e. a cell decomposition of a closed oriented 2D manifold such that every link σ1i divides exactly two 2D cells: δσ1i  =  σ2n  -  σ2m. Its end points [formula] can be also written down as the formal difference: [formula] (the signs are agreed with an orientation). By definition the boundary of a 2-cell σ2k is the formal ordered sum of 1-cells entering in it: [formula]. We attach a variable, gi, taking values in a gauge group to every link, σ1i, so that the change of an orientation, σ1i  →    -  σ1i, corresponds to the conjugation: [formula]. Gauge variables attached to different links are mutually commutative while at the same link not. Taking the ordered product of gauge variables along the boundary of a 2-cell σ2i, we define the holonomy

[formula]

The Boltzmann weights are positive-definite functions of the holonomies which can be defined by the character expansion

[formula]

where the Fourier coefficients [formula] are functions of the gauge coupling constant [formula]; [formula] is the quantum dimension of an R'th irrep. If for [formula] all [formula], the r.h.s. of Eq. ([\ref=bolwei]) becomes the group δ-function. We shall call this choice of the weights the weak coupling limit. As characters are central and every gauge variable enters in exactly two different characters, there is no problem with non-commutativity and we can define the qQCD2 partition function simply by multiplying the Boltzmann weights and integrating over all field configurations

[formula]

The integrals in this equation extract multiplicities of the trivial representation in tensor products appearing after substituting the Fourier expansion ([\ref=bolwei]) for [formula]. Let [formula] denote a matrix element of an irrep R ([formula] are representation indices). Then, by definition, for all non-trivial representations ( i.e. [formula]),

[formula]

If |q| < 1, representations of SUq(N) repeat the ones of the classical group SU(N). The standard normalization in this case is [formula]. However, in our case, we need to truncate representations in Eq. ([\ref=bolwei]) to the fusion ring (in the standard notation for SLq(2), it means [formula]). As all integrations are reduced to the orthogonality of matrix elements, indecomposable representations will never appear. Having in mind analogy with finite groups, let us normalize the integral in this case as

[formula]

For SLq(2), this number (the quantum rank) is well known:

[formula]

In what follows, we shall need a machinery to work with quantum matrix elements, etc. Let us now give the set of rules and definitions we shall use. It will be convenient to assume sums over all repeated indices (the Einstein summation rule). The conjugation in the quantum case is ambiguous, therefore let us use the bar to denote conjugate indices:

[formula]

and, in principle, they can be matched with the initial ones in many different ways. In ribbon Hopf algebras there exists at least one invertible element Cāb which does it [\cite=ReshTur]. Its square changes a framing by 1 ( e.g. in the SLq(2) case [\cite=KiResh], [formula] and [formula], where [formula] is the inverse [formula]). We shall not use it in qQCD2 and, hence, shall not take care of framings. Instead, we shall use the conjugation matrix

[formula]

where 〈RaSb|Tc〉 is the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient ( i.e. matrix elements of an irrep T in the decomposition of the tensor product [formula]). We also introduce the inverses

[formula]

Now, we can unambiguously identify

[formula]

and the unitarity condition reads

[formula]

We define the quantum character

[formula]

which is a cyclic function

[formula]

The dimensions are the characters of the unity

[formula]

The orthogonality condition for matrix elements reads

[formula]

The set of objects and operations just introduced is sufficient for our purposes, however, it should be stressed that it would not be such in the qQCD3 case, for example. Say, we have not defined the R-matrix and indeed we shall not need it in what follows.

The SLq(2) gauge group will be our main example. In this case we identify

[formula]

then

[formula]

To obtain the topological model we have to put the Boltzman weights to be the δ-functions. With our normalization ([\ref=norm]), we have to take in Eq. ([\ref=bolwei]) [formula] independent of an irrep R and such that [formula], i.e., [formula]. As we shall see, with this choice, the partition function ([\ref=parfun]) will take only integer values exactly coinciding with the Verlinde numbers. To calculate it we have to use the orthogonality condition subsequently

[formula]

(which can be interpreted as the unification of 2-cells) until we get only one 2-cell. For a genus p Riemann surface, Mp, we find

[formula]

For SLq(2), this formula takes the familiar form [\cite=Verl]

[formula]

If p = 0 (the sphere), we have no integrations and the answer is just Z(S2) = W(I) = 1.

The equation ([\ref=Z=]) has the following natural interpretation. The number of gauge variables is equal to the number of generators of the fundamental group π1(Mp), and the argument of the δ-function under the integral is its defining relation. Hence, the integral counts the number of inequivalent representations of π1(Mp) by elements of the gauge group.

The partition function of the G/G topological coset model on a Riemann surface of a genus p has exactly the same form ([\ref=Z=]), which suggests that these two models has to be closely related. To understand this relation, let us consider amplitudes, which in the G/G model coincide with the fusion rules in the corresponding WZW model. On the other hand, the complete set of observables in gauge theory is given by Wilson loop operators. In topological case, we can obtain non-trivial answers only for non-contractible loops, i.e. encircling punctures and/or handles. An arbitrary Riemann surface can be obtained by sewing spheres with three punctures. Having fixed holonomies around the punctures, we can write

[formula]

In the G/G model, we fix representation indices at punctures and the amplitude has the form of a fusion rule which can be written as the integral

[formula]

If we took a finite group, Eqs. ([\ref=gauge_amp]) and ([\ref=wzw_amp]) would be exactly dual to each other. The latter could be considered as a gauge model in which representation indices play a role of gauge variables. In general, there is no exact duality between representations and group elements, however, as we see, the topological qQCD2 and the G/G model are formally dual to each other.

Let us finish with the remark that, for knotted but otherwise contractible loops, Wilson averages will coincide with corresponding Jones polynomials. Because the loops intersect only at lattice sites, we have to insert the R-matrices at corresponding points to construct Wilson loop operators correctly.

It would be interesting to establish a connection of our approach with the one of Ref. [\cite=FR]. Despite some obvious similarity, it is not yet clear whether they are really equivalent.
