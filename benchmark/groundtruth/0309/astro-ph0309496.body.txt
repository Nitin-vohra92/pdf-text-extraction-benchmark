Environmental Effects on the Kinematics of Virgo Cluster Galaxies

Introduction

Environmental effects play an important role on the evolution of galaxies in clusters. Different mechanisms are invoked to explain the morphology segregation observed in clusters like tidal interactions between galaxies and ram pressure stripping exerted by the intra-cluster medium on disc galaxies (see Combes 2003, van Gorkom 2003 and references therein).

We are completing a survey of Virgo cluster spiral galaxies by FP observations (Chemin 2003) in order to determine the role of tidal interactions and ram-pressure stripping ( ICM-ISM interactions) on their ionized gas kinematics. Observed data-cubes will be compared with the results of 3D simulations of ICM-ISM  and/or tidal interactions (eg Vollmer 2003).

We will also investigate the influence of the environmental effects on the dark matter distribution by comparing mass models with the results of GHASP, a FP survey of local isolated galaxies (Garrido et al. 2002).

Observations

We observe galaxies for which exist deep Hα images (Koopmann et al. 2001, Gavazzi et al. 2002) and which present perturbations in their rotation curves as derived from long-slit measurements (Rubin et al. 1999). The survey spans all morphological types from S0a to Irregulars. We have already observed 25 objects which are distributed over the whole cluster, with a concentration around M87 in the cluster core where the environmental effects are expected to be stronger. The observations take place at the 1.6m Observatoire du mont Mégantic (Canada), 1.93m Observatoire de Haute-Provence (France), 3.6m Canada-France-Hawaii and 3.6m ESO telescopes, equipped with a scanning FP interferometer coupled with a photon-counting camera of very high sensitivity ( FaNTOmM and GHASP instruments, Gach et al. 2002).

The observation of NGC 4438 (Fig. 1) has been done on April 2002 at the 3.6m ESO telescope. The field of view is 3.6 and the spatial sampling is 0.42arcsec. The spectral step and the total exposure time were 16 km/s and 9360s respectively.

Results

Figure 1 (left) presents the Hα emission map of NGC 4438, a highly inclined disc located near the cluster core. It shows bright H II regions which are associated to the galactic disc and to the nuclear outflow recently evidenced by Kenney & Yale (2002). Diffuse filaments along which are observed a few brighter clumps are seen on the western side of the disc. The right panel of the figure presents the complex velocity field of NGC 4438 (Chemin et al., in prep.). Both fields indicate strong signs of perturbations, probably induced by an ICM-ISM  interaction and/or a tidal interaction with a companion.
