A combinatorial identity arising from cobordism theory

Dedicated to the memory of Alexander Reznikov

Introduction

Let m  ≥  3. Let [formula] and suppose that there is no ε∈{  ±  1}m satisfying [formula]. Let 1  ≤  i < j  ≤  m. Let [formula] be the vector obtained from α on deleting αi and αj. Let

[formula]

Define [formula]. Theorem 2.1 of [\cite=BM] states that the reduction of #  Si,j(α) mod 2 only depends on α and that in case m odd, Ni,j(α) only depends on α. In particular it was shown that for m  ≥  3 and odd we have

[formula]

From ([\ref=besser]) we of course immediately read off that if m  ≥  3 is odd, Ni,j(α) does not depend on the choice of i and j.

Example 1.1. We take [formula], where [formula] denote the consecutive primes and put [formula]. Then it is not difficult to show that, for 1  ≤  i < j  ≤  m,

[formula]

where P(n) denotes the largest prime factor of n and μ the Möbius function. For m  ≥  2 put

[formula]

where sgn denotes the sign function. The fundamental theorem of arithmetic ensures there is no ε∈{  ±  1}m satisfying 〈ε,βm〉 = 0. By ([\ref=besser]) we then infer that if m  ≥  3 is odd, Ni,j(βm) = g(m) and so does not depend on the choice of i and j. By Remark 2.5 of [\cite=BM] we have g(m) = 0 for m  ≥  2 and even. The first non-trivial values one finds for g(m) are given in the table below.

(The value given for m = 15 corrects the value at p. 471 of [\cite=BM]. For a computer program to evaluate these values see [\cite=N].)

Example 1.2. Put [formula]. The sequence [formula] is sequence A068101 of OEIS [\cite=Q]. Let n > 1 be a squarefree integer having k distinct prime divisors [formula] with k  ≥  2. Note that in the previous example we only used that [formula] are distinct primes. If we replace them by [formula] we infer, proceeding as in the previous example, that

[formula]

is an integer that equals zero if k is even. On using that [formula] it is seen that [formula], whence the following result is inferred:

General setup

We consider a more general quantity Nσ(a,b) similar to Ni,j(α) so that the latter is a special case of the former. Let X be a finite set. Suppose that we have a map σ:2X  →  { - 1,1} such that [formula] for all A  ⊆  X. We will call such a map σ even. Let u,v∈X with u  ≠  v. Define

[formula]

where the summation is over all subsets A of X such that u∈A, [formula] and σ(A) = σ(A + v). Proof. We have

[formula]

where we used that there is a bijection between the sets containing u and those not containing u, the bijection being taking complementary sets. [formula]

Remark. In case the cardinality of X is odd, we can alternatively consider a map τ:2X  →  { - 1,1} such that [formula] for all A  ⊆  X. Then the map σ defined by σ(A) = ( - 1)#  Aτ(A) is even and the conditions of Proposition [\ref=main] are satisfied.

Examples

We present three applications of Theorem 1.

Example 3.1. Suppose [formula] and m  ≥  3. Let f be a map such that f(xj) =   ±  1 for 1  ≤  j  ≤  m. Consider the map σ:2X  →  { - 1,1} defined by [formula] for A  ⊆  X. Let us assume that [formula] (so that σ is an even map). Theorem 1 then gives that

[formula]

Example 3.2. We reprove the main result from [\cite=BM] which is reproduced in the present note as ([\ref=besser]), where we now drop the requirement that αj > 0 for 1  ≤  j  ≤  m. Let [formula] be a set of cardinality m consisting of real numbers such that there is no ε∈{  ±  1}m satisfying 〈ε,α〉 = 0. Let A be any subset of X. To A we associate [formula], where εj =  - 1 if αj∈A and εj = 1 otherwise. Let [formula]. By assumption 〈ε,α〉  ≠  0 and hence σ(A)∈{ - 1,1}. Let i  ≠  j. We evaluate Nσ(αi,αj) according to the definition ([\ref=definition]). We obtain that [formula], where the dash indicates that we sum over those ε∈{  ±  1}m, where εi =  - 1, εj = 1 and

[formula]

Note that the latter condition is satisfied iff αi - |αj|  <  〈εi,j,αi,j〉  <  αi + |αj|. If ε∈{  ±  1}m satisfies the latter inequality, εi =  - 1 and εj = 1, then

[formula]

We infer that

[formula]

In case m is odd, σ is even and Theorem 1 can be applied (note that Nσ(αi,αj) =  - Ni,j(α)) to give the following corollary. In case [formula] it is not immediately clear that this result implies ([\ref=besser]). To see that this is nevertheless true it suffices to show that under the conditions of Corollary 1 we have Ni,j(α) = Ni,j(α). If αj  ≤  αi this is obvious, so assume that αj  >  αi. Notice that ε∈{  ±  1}m - 2 is in [formula] iff [formula]. But if ε satisfies the latter inequality, so does -  ε and both are counted with opposite sign in Ni,j(α) - Ni,j(α) and consequently Ni,j(α) = Ni,j(α).

Example 3.3. Corollary 1 can be generalised to a higher dimensional setting. Instead of numbers [formula] we can consider points [formula] with [formula] and n  ≥  2. We assume that [formula]. Let us define B to be the matrix with αj as jth row for 1  ≤  j  ≤  m. Choose a hyperplane H through the origin not containing any of the points [formula] (the assumption that [formula] ensures that this is possible). Let [formula] be on the normal of this hyperplane. Let A be any subset of X. To A we associate [formula], where εj =  - 1 if αj∈A and εj = 1 otherwise. Let [formula]. The assumption on H implies that 〈εB〉  ≠  0 and hence σ(A)∈{ - 1,1}. Choose two points αi and αj, i  ≠  j. Let V be the hyperplane with normal [formula] containing αi  -  αj and W be the hyperplane with normal [formula] containing αi  +  αj. We define the weight w(α) of a point α of the form [formula] with εi,j∈{  ±  1}m - 2 to be [formula]. Note that our choice of [formula] ensures that none of these points is in V or W. Then let M(i,j) be the sum of the weights of all points [formula] that are in between V and W and for which εi,j∈{  ±  1}m - 2. If m  ≥  3 is odd, then σ is an even map. It is not difficult to show that Nσ(αi,αj) =   ±  M(i,j), where the sign is independent of i and j. Theorem 1 applies and we infer that M(i,j) is independent of the choice of i and j.

Acknowledgement. We thank Tony Noe for pointing out a typo in [\cite=BM] and for providing us with the table given in this note. This note has its source in a question posed by the late Alexander Reznikov to Amnon Besser and the second author in the summer of 1997, whilst all three of them were enjoying the hospitality of the MPI in Bonn. Reznikov came to this question on the basis of computations (together with Luca Migliorini) in the cobordism theory of the moduli space of polygons. The second author remembers Alexander Reznikov as a very original and creative mathematician and an intriguing and interesting personality. The research of the second author was made possible thanks to Prof. E. Opdam's PIONIER-grant from the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO).
