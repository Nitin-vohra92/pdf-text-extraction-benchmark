Families and clustering in a natural numbers network

I. Introduction

The new century have started with a strong development in network theory and specially in small-world networks. Three ingredients are necessary to define a small-world network: a sparse network, small distance and high clustering coefficient [\cite=WTmodel] [\cite=barabasi]. Many examples of these networks have been analyzed in diverse fields as computation [\cite=computation1] [\cite=computation2], linguistic [\cite=linguistic1] [\cite=linguistic2], biology [\cite=biology1] [\cite=biology2], economics [\cite=economics] [\cite=eco2] and social phenomena [\cite=new1] [\cite=sex]. In addition to the interest in the description of these particular phenomena, small-world networks are promising elements to compose a general theory of complex systems.

Nowadays the two major research lines in networks are the search for small world networks in nature and the investigation of theoretic models that explain the properties of such networks. The first line was pointed out in the first paragraph. The second line is dominated by the evolving network models [\cite=evol1] [\cite=evol2] and the study of phase order transitions in networks [\cite=phase1] [\cite=phase2]. This work is situated at an intermediary place between both lines. We characterize a network using recent techniques of statistical physics but instead of looking for real data in the world we construct a network using some properties of the set of natural numbers.

We use as the keystone in the construction of number networks the fundamental theorem of number theory which says that each natural number has an unique decomposition in prime factors. It means, for a number a and prime numbers pj, there is an unique product:

[formula]

where the exponent αj is the multiplicity of the prime pj. The simplest way to define a link between two vertices (numbers) is the following: each time two numbers have a prime in common in equation ([\ref=fund]) they have a connection. We shall see that only this criterium is not good enough to construct networks with small clustering coefficient.

This paper has a twofold objective: present a new network model based on number properties and characterize this network using the approach of modern complex network analyzes. In section 2 we show the model M and its extensions Ml, we drive our attention to the degree distribution of the network, the set of families and the search of invariant quantities. In section 3 we analyse the distance and the clustering coefficient for these networks. In section 4 we give our final remarks.

II. The Model

In this section we present the standard model M and its extensions Ml. We use the set of natural numbers as vertices and an arithmetic property establishes the connections. The connections have no weight neither direction.

A. The Basic Model M

In model M the criterium for the existence of a connection between two vertices is the following: there is a link between two numbers a and b if they share a common divisor. In other words, if a and b have a common prime number pj in decomposition ([\ref=fund]) a link is established.

Figure [\ref=fig1] shows a simple realization of this rule for number of vertices N = 16. All the even numbers are interconnected (they share the prime p = 2). Besides the divisors of 3, 5, etc, are also interconnected. The most connected numbers for this N are 6 and 12 because they are linked to all the even numbers and all the multiples of 3.

The first point we explore in the network M is the degree distribution, it means the connectivity k of the vertex i for vertices ordered according to the connectivity. Figure [\ref=fig2] displays k versus i. In this figure we have N = 212 = 4096 vertices. The vertex i with maximum number of links is i = 2310 = 2  ×  3  ×  5  ×  7  ×  11 which is connected with all the even numbers and with the multiples of 3, 5, 7, and 11. In general, the most connected vertex in a network M of N vertices corresponds to the maximum number i = p1p2...pm  ≤  N where the pj correspond to the first primes (which are the most connected numbers). In the opposite side of the graphic there are the prime numbers pj that have k = 0, these numbers satisfy the relation 2pj  ≤  N (if pj do not fulfill this relation it will be connected to the node 2 and it would not have k = 0). The general view of the degree distribution shown in figure [\ref=fig2] is the following. Half of the vertices, which corresponds to the even numbers, are connected among them, so they have k  ≥  N / 2. Otherwise, the odd numbers have k < N / 2 because they are at least not connected to all the even numbers. The frontier between these two sets is indicated by the large plateau that starts at i = N / 2.

The plateau in the middle of figure [\ref=fig2] corresponds to the family of multiples of the number 2. In the beginning of this plateau we find the numbers 2α for 1  ≤  α  ≤  12 = log2N. These numbers are connected with all the even numbers and only with them. For these numbers k  =  N  /  2. The smooth tail that comes for i  <  N  /  2 is formed by the numbers type 2αpj  ≤  N where pj is a weak connected prime. These numbers are connected with all the even numbers and with the connections of pj that are just a few.

The second largest plateau is related to the multiples of three (indicated F3 in figure [\ref=fig2]). One third of the N natural numbers are multiples of three and have connectivity larger that all the other odd numbers. In the beginning of this plateau we find the numbers of the form 3β where 1  ≤  β  ≤   log 3N. This plateau is smaller than the former one because there are less multiples of three than two. For these numbers k  =  N  /  3, it means, they are connected only with the multiples of three. The tail of this plateau is formed by the numbers 3βpj  ≤  N, for pj weakly connected. There are also plateaus visible in figure [\ref=fig2] corresponding to the primes 5, 7 and 11. For these plateaus we have in the coordinate axis k = N  /  5, N  /  7, and N  /  11, respectively.

Another plateau indicated in the figure is formed by the numbers that share the two primes 2 and 3, it means the numbers that are multiples of 6. This plateau starts with numbers of the form: 2α3β  ≤  N. If the network were weighted, k of this plateau would be the sum of k of 2 and 3 plateaus. As the network does not count multiple links the corresponding value of k is smaller than the cited sum. We call F2 the even plateau, F10 the plateau generated by the numbers that are divisible only by 2 and 5, and so one. The most important family plateaus F2, F3, F5, F7, F10, F14 and F15 are indicated in figure [\ref=fig2].

Figure [\ref=fig2] shows two distinct regions, above i  =  N  /  2 the degree distribution is dominated mainly by plateaus of prime numbers of the form: pαjj and their respective tails. Bellow this number there are only plateaus composed by the combination of prime numbers of the form: pαjjpαmm and their tails. In fact in the limit of N  →    ∞   an infinite number of plateaus would appear in the curve whose relative sizes is determined by equation ([\ref=fund]). We conjecture that in this limit a fractal distribution will appear.

We have k  =  N  /  2 for the beginning of the plateau F2, and in general k  =  N  /  pk for the families of primes Fk. This relation suggests an interesting scale property: the degrees scales linearly with N. We verify numerically this fact in figure [\ref=fig3] where we plot the normalized connectivity, (k / N), versus the normalized index, (i  /  N), for N = 128,512 and 2048. This figure verify by simulation that the connectivity of the model M scales linearly with the number of vertices.

B. The extension Ml of the Model M

In the standard number decomposition, equation ([\ref=fund]), there is the possibility of including, or not, the factor 1 because all the numbers are trivially divisible by the unity. If the number 1 is included in the decomposition all the numbers would share the same common divisor and, as a consequence, the network will became trivial: all the vertices will be interconnected. In the same way as we excluded the number 1 as a divisor in the criterium for establishing links, we could also exclude the number 2. This idea suggests an alternative procedure to define a network model for natural numbers.

The network model Mpl is the following. The vertices are again the natural numbers and the connections are set using equation ([\ref=fund]), but we take into account only connections of primes pj  ≥  pl. In this sense the former model M is in fact M2 because the links are established once there is a common factor pj such that pj  ≥  2. In this way, the network M3 take into account the primes pj = 3,5,... to establish links, but not the prime 2.

Figure [\ref=fig4] shows the degree distribution (k versus i in order of decreasing connectivity) for M2, M3, M5, and M7 as indicated in the figure. We use in the figure N = 211. The curve of M2 is the same curve shown in figure [\ref=fig2]. The curve of M3 is similar to M2, but the largest even plateau, F2, is absent. The largest plateau of M3 starts at i = N / 3, because all the one third of the most connected numbers are multiples of 3. We observe that the largest plateau of M3 has the same k of F3 of network M2, in fact in both cases the plateaus is formed by the F3 family. The curve M5 does not show the plateaus corresponding to the families F2 and F3 as expected; and in this case the largest plateau is formed by the F5 family. The curve of M7 follows the same tendency. As a general trend the curves of degree distribution of Ml become smother for increasing l because they have less connections related to important prime numbers and, as a consequence, they present less plateaus. The criterium for establishing links in the model Ml becomes more restrictive as l increases because the number of connections decrease. It is interesting that the average connectivity, [formula], normalized by N tends to a constant as N  →    ∞   (n is the number of connections in the network). In Table I we show [formula] for the networks Ml.

Table I

Ml M2 M3 M5 M7

[formula] 0.45 0.20 0.09 0.05 [formula] 1.78 3.65 8.22 14.5

The first conclusion we take from the table is that the model M is not sparse, it means, the network does not fulfill the condition [formula]. Therefore we have to be caution to compare properties of such graphs with usual complex graphs in the physics literature. The reason for [formula] is rooted in the way connections are established in the network. Each time a new even number is added it is connected with, at least, N / 2 vertices, and a multiple of three with N / 3 vertices. This fact illustrates that in the average [formula] increases linearly with N.

We also analyze the scaling properties of the model Ml. Figure [\ref=fig5] shows the normalized connectivity, (k  /  N), versus the normalized index, (i  /  N), for the model M5. This curve is similar to the one of figure [\ref=fig3], here we also use N = 128,512 and 2048. The data collapse performed in the figure indicates that the network M5 scales with N. In fact, this same tendency is observed for all networks Ml analyzed. This behavior is related, as before, with the plateaus of prime numbers pj whose connectivity scales with N. The fact that the degree distribution of the networks Ml scales with N suggests the existence of magnitudes that are independent of N. This is the case of [formula] and this is also the case of the clustering coefficient as we shall see in the next section.

III. Clustering coefficient and network distance

In this section we characterize the network models Ml using the distance, d, and the clustering coefficient, C. One of our objectives in this work is to differentiate Ml from random networks, it means, networks whose distribution of links among vertices follow a Poisson distribution. Therefore we compare d and C of Ml with d and C of the random network associated, it means, the random network with the same number of vertices and connections.

The distance of a network is defined as the average distance between all the two vertices of the network. The clustering coefficient is a global parameter [formula] which is based on the local clustering coefficient ci. For each vertex i the respective ci, is defined as the normalized number of connection among its first neighbors. The parameter C measures the average interconnection of the network. Using the example of social networks of acquaintances, ci measures how much the friends of a person (vertex i) are friends among them. For a major treatment on this topic see [\cite=barabasi].

The distance of the random network associated, drand, is estimated by simulation. We note that, because the graph is not sparse, it is not valid that [formula]. In fact, for non-sparse graphs the distance is almost always two [\cite=mathbook]. Otherwise, the clustering coefficient of the random graph associated, Crand, is analytically estimated [\cite=barabasi] and depend only on the number of vertices N and the number of connections n. For the random graph the clustering coefficient is [formula]. We call [formula] and [formula] as the normalized distance and clustering coefficient.

Figure [\ref=fig6] shows the distance d against the network size N for the data of the models M2, M3, M5, and M7. The graphic is in log-linear form because of the large interval used in N. The data confirms the prevision for non-sparse graphs that the distance is around 2. We estimate [formula] for the networks M2, M3, M5, and M7 in the range 25  ≤  N  ≤  212 and find that 0.5  <    <  0.9. The general tendency is: [formula] slowly increases with N. In addition, l large in models Ml implies smaller [formula]. This last fact is expected since for large l the connections of the network are more selective and organized.

The analysis of [formula] for M2, M3, M5 and M7 shows that it increases with N until N≃26 and stabilize around a constant value. In Table II it is shown [formula] for several N for the model M5, the other models Ml follow a similar trend.

Table II

[formula] 32 64 128 256 512 1024 [formula] 6.95 8.33 8.18 8.19 8.28 8.36

The data points to a constant [formula] in the limit N  →    ∞  . The size invariance of [formula] is compatible with the size invariance of the degree distribution. The best values of [formula] for M2, M3, M5 and M7 are shown in Table I. We observe in this table that [formula] for the network Ml increases with l. The clustering coefficient increases as the criterium for establishing connections in the network becomes more selective. In fact, for a constant N, the number of connection, n, in the Ml model decreases for high l (see Table I). As a result [formula] decreases in contrast with estimated C that remain almost constant.

IV. Final Remarks

In this work we propose a new network model in which the natural numbers are the vertices and the connections are based on their decomposition by prime numbers. Using this criterium we develop a non-sparse network ([formula]) which have a distance of the order of 2. If we consider that all the prime numbers in the decomposition set a link the network formed is similar to a random graph because the high number of connections implies in a small clustering coefficient. If the criterium for establishing links becomes more selective, only prime numbers greater than 3, or 5, are used to establish links the network has a large clustering coefficient.

We perform data collapse on the data and verify that the networks studied have a degree distribution that is invariant with the number of vertices N. The general view of the degree distribution is a funny discontinuous curve with plateaus of all sizes. These plateaus are generated by the families of numbers that share the same prime numbers in their decomposition.

An important class of networks are the scale-free ones. This concept is mainly used to distinguish between networks that have exponential and power-law degree distributions. In the exponential case most of the vertices have a typical connectivity inside a range defined by the exponent of the exponential function. In the other side, a power-law case has connections of all orders, it does not have a set of vertices with a typical connectivity. The number network Ml do not have a smooth degree distribution because of the plateaus formed by the families of prime numbers Fk, therefore it is not possible to fit the degree by a smooth curve. On the other side, due to families Fk, this network has vertices with all orders of connectivity corresponding to all sizes of primes and their combinations. In this broad sense the network Ml can be called a scale-free network.

This work unfolds an alternative perspective in the study of complex networks. Instead of search for real networks in nature we explore deterministic mathematical networks that show small distance and high clustering coefficient. Despite the present network is non-sparse it is a promising laboratory in the study of degree distribution and cluster families. In a future work we intend to explore some theoretical developments of this problem: an evolving network algorithm for Ml and an analysis of phase transition in this model.
