Summation formulae for elliptic hypergeometric series

Introduction

Recently there has been much interest in elliptic hypergeometric series [\cite=vDS00] [\cite=vDS01a] [\cite=vDS01b] [\cite=vDS02] [\cite=FT97] [\cite=KN03] [\cite=KNR03] [\cite=Rosengren01] [\cite=Rosengren02] [\cite=RS03] [\cite=Spiridonov01] [\cite=Spiridonov02a] [\cite=Spiridonov02] [\cite=Spiridonov03] [\cite=SZ99] [\cite=W02] [\cite=W03]. The simplest examples of such series are of the type

[formula]

where θ(a;p) is a theta function and (a;q,p)n is the elliptic analogue of the q-shifted factorial As usual,

For reasons of convergence one must impose that one of the parameters ai is of the form q- n so that the above series terminates. Furthermore, to obtain non-trivial results, r must be odd and

For ordinary as well as basic hypergeometric series a vast number of summation identities are known, see e.g., [\cite=GR90] [\cite=Slater66]. Unfortunately, most of these do not appear to have an elliptic analogue and to the best of my knowledge the only two summation identities for series of the type [\eqref=Vr] known to date are the elliptic Jackson sum of Frenkel and Turaev [\cite=FT97]

[formula]

for bcde = a2qn + 1, and the identity [\cite=W02]

[formula]

In a recent paper [\cite=W03] I stated without proof that

[formula]

When p tends to zero this simplifies to a bibasic summation of Nassrallah and Rahman [\cite=NR81] (see also [\cite=GR90]). Initially I was only able to find a rather unpleasant inductive proof, but an e-mail exchange with Vyacheslav Spiridonov prompted me to try again to find a more constructive derivation of [\eqref=biba]. In this paper I will give such a proof. Interestingly, it depends crucially on the new elliptic identity

[formula]

which provides a third example of a summable r  +  1Vr series.

The quasi-periodicity of the theta functions

[formula]

yields

[formula]

Morover, from

[formula]

it follows that

[formula]

Hence Using standard notation for basic hypergeometric series [\cite=GR90] it thus follows that in the p  →  0 limit [\eqref=new1] becomes

[formula]

Using Watson's 8φ7 transformation [\cite=GR90] this may be also put as

[formula]

an identity discovered recently in [\cite=BW03].

Given [\eqref=new1] the proof of [\eqref=biba] is routine, but proving [\eqref=new1] is unexpectetly difficult since its constructive proof requires [\eqref=biba]! In the next section I will therefore give a rather non-standard proof of [\eqref=new1] by specializing a recent elliptic transformation formula of Spiridonov in a singular point. The bonus of this proof is that it immediately suggests the following companion to [\eqref=new1]

[formula]

with [formula] and [formula]. This is the fourth example of a r  +  1Vr that can be summed. In the limit when p tends to zero [\eqref=new2] simplifies to

[formula]

By Watson's 8φ7 transformation this can be further reduced to Andrews' terminating q-analogue of Watson's 3F2 sum [\cite=Andrews76] (see also [\cite=GR90])

[formula]

The identities [\eqref=new1] and [\eqref=new2] together with Watson's transformation imply the 4φ3 sums [\eqref=BW] and [\eqref=A]. It is however also possible to rewrite [\eqref=new1] and [\eqref=new2] as two elliptic summations that yield [\eqref=BW] and [\eqref=A] when p tends to zero without an appeal to Watson's transformation. Making the substitution a  →  ap in [\eqref=new1] and using the quasi-periodicities [\eqref=quasi1] and [\eqref=quasi2] yields

[formula]

By [\eqref=lim1] and [\eqref=lim2] the p  →  0 limit breaks the very-well-poisedness, resulting in [\eqref=BW]. In much the same way, replacing a  →  ap in [\eqref=new2] and using [\eqref=quasi1] and [\eqref=quasi2] yields

[formula]

When p tend to 0 this reduces to [\eqref=A].

The results [\eqref=linp] and [\eqref=linp2] show that, potentially, many more identities for series that are balanced but not very-well poised may have an elliptic analogue. Indeed, after showing him [\eqref=linp] and [\eqref=linp2], Michael Schlosser observed that making the simultaneous variable changes {a,d,e,p}  →  {ap,aqp / d,ep,p2} in [\eqref=V109] gives for bce = adqn. In the p to 0 limit this results in the q-Pfaff-Saalschütz sum [\cite=GR90]

Probably the most important balanced summation not yet treated is Andrews' terminating q-analogue of Wipple's 3F2 sum [\cite=Andrews76] (see also [\cite=GR90])

[formula]

To obtain its elliptic analogue I will first prove the new identity

[formula]

Replacing b  →  bp and using [\eqref=quasi1] and [\eqref=quasi2] this implies the identity

[formula]

which simplifies to [\eqref=qWhipple] when p tends to 0 thanks to [\eqref=lim1] and [\eqref=lim2].

Proofs of [\eqref=biba], [\eqref=new1], [\eqref=new2] and [\eqref=new3]

First I will give a proof of [\eqref=biba] assuming [\eqref=new1], and a proof of [\eqref=new1] assuming [\eqref=biba]. Then I will give a different proof of [\eqref=new1] based on the transformation [\eqref=Sp] below.

When cd = aq equation [\eqref=V109] simplifies to

[formula]

with δn,m  =  χ(n = m). Making the simultaneous replacements then multiplying both sides by and finally summing r from 0 to n yields

[formula]

Interchanging the order of summation and using the identity

[formula]

this becomes

[formula]

Summing the 12V11 series by [\eqref=new1] and making some simplifications completes the proof.

Replacing in [\eqref=V87], multiplying both sides by and summing r from 0 to n yields

[formula]

A change in the order of summation leads to

[formula]

The sum over r can be performed by [\eqref=biba] giving

[formula]

Once more using [\eqref=id] and replacing a by ab completes the proof.

To give a proof of [\eqref=new1] that does not rely on [\eqref=biba] I need the following transformation formula of Spiridonov [\cite=Spiridonov02] (see also [\cite=W02]):

[formula]

for m = bck / a2q2 and d =  - m / a. When p tends to 0 this becomes

[formula]

which is equivalent to a bibasic transformation of Nassrallah and Rahman [\cite=NR81] (see also [\cite=GR90]). In the above representation [\eqref=NR414] has been rediscovered very recently in [\cite=AB02].

To now prove [\eqref=new1] I observe that the 14V13 series on the left side of [\eqref=Sp] as well as the prefactor on the right side of [\eqref=Sp] are singular for k = a2. Multiplying both sides by (k / a2;q2,p2)n and observing that for 0  ≤  r  ≤  n it follows that in the limit when k tends to a2 only the term with r = n survives in the sum on the left (with r being the summation index of the 14V13 series). As a result

[formula]

with m = bc / q2 and d =  - m / a. Since the only dependence on b and c is through the definition of m, the equation m = bc / q2 is superfluous, and the above is true with a and m arbitrary indeterminates. Making the simultaneous changes m  →  ab and a  →   - a yields [\eqref=new1].

As mentioned in the introduction, the above proof of [\eqref=new1] immediately suggests [\eqref=new2] by virtue of the fact that [\eqref=Sp] has the companion [\cite=W02]

[formula]

for m = bck / aq and d = m(q / a)1 / 2. In the p  →  0 limit this gives

[formula]

due to Rahman and Verma [\cite=RV93] (see also [\cite=AB02]).

This time the singularity to be exploited occurs for k = a. Multiplying both sides of [\eqref=Wa] by (k / a;q,p)n and observing that for 0  ≤  2r  ≤  n it follows that in the k  →  a limit only the term with 2r = n survives in the sum on the left (with r being the summation index of the 14V13 series). Hence

[formula]

with m = bc / q and d = m(q / a)1 / 2. Again the dependence on b and c is only through the definition of m, so that the above is true for arbitrary a and m. Making the simultaneous changes m  →  ab, a  →  a2q and p  →  p2 yields [\eqref=new2].

Making the simultaneous substitutions in the elliptic analogue of Bailey's 10φ9 transformation [\cite=FT97]

[formula]

for bcdefg = a3qn + 2 and λ = a2q / bcd, [\eqref=new3] can be transformed into

[formula]

Here the right-hand side has been simplified using with a  →  q and b  →  q / b. When viewed as functions of c it is easy to see from [\eqref=quasi2] that both sides of [\eqref=V1211] satisfy f(c) = f(cp2). Consequently it is enough to give a proof for c = qn - m + 1 with m an integer such that m  ≥  2n + 1. But this is nothing but [\eqref=new2] with n  →  m and a  →  bq- n - 1.
