Intensive investigations of Z-boson physics are carried out in a process of e+e- annihilation at the LEP. In particular, the processes of e+e-  →  fγγ type (where f is an arbitrary fermion) are analysed in detail. For example, four such events with the lepton pair and the hard photon pair (with the invariant mass mγγ≃60  GeV) in the final state has been observed in the LEP data collected in 1991 and 1992 [\cite=L3l]. In these experiments the center-of-mass energy of the e+e- pair is close to the Z-boson mass, so the final state is mainly the result of a real Z-boson production and its decay into fγγ. For the "hard" photons (mγγ  >  20  GeV) a possible contribution to the processes e+e-  →  fγγ with the photon bremsstrahlung from the initial state is suppressed. Only corrections connecting with the "soft" photon radiation from the initial state are essential. In the papers [\cite=Ja] [\cite=S] [\cite=JaW] such type events either with photon bremsstrahlung from the initial state or without it were estimated by numerical methods. In the framework of the Standard Model the additional channel e+e-  →  ZH  →  fγγ with the Standard Higgs boson in the intermediate state is possible, but its contribution to the full cross section of this process is rather small. For that reason the four events announced by the L3 collaboration [\cite=L3l] can not be explained by the manifestation of the Standard Higgs boson with the mass mH≃60  GeV (see, for example, [\cite=KK]).

In this paper we calculated analytically the Z-boson decay Z  →  fγγ in the framework of the Standard Model in the approximation of leading logarithms. We obtained a simple expression for the distribution function on the invariant masses of the photon and fermion pairs. It is shown that the distribution function has a shape of a "crest".

The process Z  →  fγγ in the Standard Model is described by the set of six graphs (see Fig.1) and has the following matrix element:

[formula]

where eQ is the fermion charge, ε(Z)α is the Z-boson polarization vector and Jα is the four-current of the final state fγγ:

[formula]

The currents J(i)α and (i)α are calculated according to the standard Feynman rules and have the following form:

[formula]

[formula]

where mf is the fermion mass, ε1,k1 and ε2,k2 are the polarization vectors and the four-momenta of the photons, p1 and p2 are the fermion and antifermion four-momenta, T3 is the third component of the fermion weak isospin.

For further analysis it is useful to introduce the dimensionless invariant masses of the photon pair x and of the fermion pair y:

[formula]

The differential probability of the decay Z  →  fγγ with the hard photons was calculated in the approximation of leading logarithms ((p1k1)  ≪  m2Z,(p1k2)  ≪  m2Z,(p2k1)  ≪  m2Z,(p2k2)  ≪  m2Z). The correspondent distribution function has a simple form:

[formula]

where mZ is the Z-boson mass and Δmfγ is the cut of the invariant mass of the photon - fermion pair. Let us note that in the leading logarithmic approximation fermion mass effects may be negligible even for heavy (τ-lepton and c- and b-quarks) fermions. The distribution function F(x,y) ties the distributions in two different regions on the (x,y)-plane:

i) the neighbourhood of the physical region boundary x + y = 1, where I(x,y) is close to zero and may be negligible in the ratio of the expression ([\ref=eq:disf]);

ii) the region far from the boundary, where the term containing rfγ in the denominator of ([\ref=eq:disf]) may be negligible.

The integrating of the expression ([\ref=eq:disf]) over the invariant masses x and y with the cut of the photon invariant mass gives the partial width Γ(Z  →  fγγ) of the Z-boson decay in the leading logarithmic approximation:

[formula]

where Δmγγ is the cut of the invariant mass of the photon pair.

The distribution function F(x,y) with Δmfγ  =  2  GeV (Fig.2) and with Δmfγ  =  6  GeV (Fig.3) is represented in the intervals 0.5  ≤  x  ≤  1 and 0  ≤  y  ≤  0.5. The distributions showing on Fig.2 and Fig.3 have a specific shape of a "crest" which is parallel to the border of the physical region x + y = 1. The "crest" is dependent of the cut of the fermion - photon invariant mass Δmfγ: with decreasing mass cut it becomes more narrow and steeper. Events will be observed mainly in the neighbourhood of the border x + y = 1 either the statistics of the Z  →  fγγ events will be increased or the precision of the angular resolution of the fermion - photon pair will be improved. Let us note that the parameters x and y of the four experimental [formula] events [\cite=L3l] fall into the examined region and in fact lie near the border of the physical region (see Fig.4 of the preprint [\cite=L3l]).

The expression ([\ref=eq:disf]) allows to estimate the branch of the "hard" radiative decay Z  →  fγγ for different fermion flavours in the following way:

[formula]

where [formula] is the total Z - boson width and x0 is the minimal value of the "hard" photon invariant mass (we took x0  =  0.5). For the lepton pair production the expression ([\ref=eq:Br]) gives Br(0.5)  =  2.8  ·  10- 6;2.1  ·  10- 6 and 1.1  ·  10- 6 for the mass cut [formula]; 3  GeV and 6  GeV correspondingly. It does not contradict to the LEP statistic data on the leptonic Z - boson decays (~  106 events) [\cite=L3l]: the decays Z  →  τ+τ-γγ with Δmτγ  ~  6  GeV are absent and the number of μ+μ-γγ events with Δmμγ  ~  2  GeV (three events) is larger than e+e-γγ with Δmeγ  ~  3  GeV (one event). Near Z resonance the processes with "hard" photons e+e-  →  γγ + hadrons are mostly the result of the quark-photon decays Z  →  qγγ of the Z-boson. The quark decay probability differs from the leptonic one by the factor:

The factor Cq for "up" and "down" quarks has the values: Cu≃0.7 and Cd≃0.15. Let us note that the value of the mass cut of the quarks forming the hadronic jets is the same as or even greater than the one for the τ - lepton. Taking this into account we obtained from ([\ref=eq:Br]) the following limits for "up" and "down" quarks: Bru(0.5)  ≤  0.9  ·  10- 6 and Brd(0.5)  ≤  0.2  ·  10- 6. It is clear that on the recent level of the data statistics [\cite=L3h] such processes are invisible. In our approximation the processes [formula] are absent because the neutrino has not the electric charge Qν  =  0.

In conclusion, we calculate the probability of the foundation of n events clustering within an arbitrary mass bin of 2 Δx width inside the photon invariant mass region x  ≥  x0 in the following way:

[formula]

where L  =  x0 / (2Δx) is the full number of the 2Δx width stripes in the region x  ≥  x0 and [formula] is the average value of x in the stripe. The estimation by ([\ref=eq:clust]) of the four clustering events (n = 4) probability with the parameters x0≃0.5 and Δx≃0.025 gives W4(0.5;0.025)  =  1.5  ·  10- 2. It is not exclude the possibility of the describing of the four events [\cite=L3l] within the Standard Model as the double radiative decay [formula].

Note added

After the paper was completed, we received the preprint by K. Kolodziej, F. Jegerlehner and G.J. van Oldenborgh [\cite=KJO] in which the process e+e-  →  μ+μ-γγ is analysed by numerical methods. In particular, estimations of the cross section of this process, expected number of such events in an experiment, and the distribution function on the invariant masses of the photon and muon pairs are represented. The results of our paper agree with those of the preprint [\cite=KJO].
