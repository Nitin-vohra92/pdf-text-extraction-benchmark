Proposition

On the non-vanishing of the first Betti number of hyperbolic three manifolds

Introduction

Let D be a quaternion division algebra over a number field E. Let G denote the connected, semisimple algebraic group SL1(D) over E. Denote by G∞(E) the real Lie group [formula] and fix a maximal compact subgroup K∞ of G∞. Let s1 (resp. 2r2) be the number of real (resp. complex) places of E at which D splits, and let s = s1 + r2. The quotient space M: = G∞ / K∞ with the natural G∞(E)-invariant metric, is a symmetric space isomorphic to Hs12  ×  Hr23, where for a natural number n, Hn denotes the simply connected hyperbolic space of dimension n.

Let [formula] (resp. [formula]) denote the ring of adeles (resp. finite adeles) of [formula]. Let K be a compact, open subgroup of [formula], and denote by ΓK the corresponding congruence arithmetic lattice in G∞(E) defined by the projection to G∞(E) of the group [formula]. For sufficiently small congruence subgroups K, ΓK is a torsion-free lattice and [formula] is a (compact) Riemannian manifold.

In this note, we prove

With the above notation, assume further that E is a finite extension of a totally real number field F contained inside a solvable extension L of F. For sufficiently small congruence subgroups Γ  ⊂  G∞(E), the cohomology groups

[formula]

are non-zero.

The theorem was proved by Labesse and Schwermer [\cite=LS], in the case when there exists a tower of field extensions

[formula]

such that Fi + 1 / Fi is either a cyclic extension of prime degree or a non-normal cubic extension. The proof rests on the following two observations: one, that the base change (constructed by Langlands [\cite=L]) of the discrete series representations from [formula] to [formula] are cohomologically non-trivial representations of [formula], and thus the base change of cohomologically non-trivial cusp forms (for SL(2)) are cohomologically non-trivial. Secondly, when working with the group SL2 over a totally real field, the required cohomologically non-trivial automorphic representations have discrete series as their archimedean components, and an argument using pseudo-coefficients shows the existence of such cusp forms.

The new ingredient that goes into extending the theorem of Labesse and Schwermer to all relatively solvable extensions of a totally real field, is the criterion of base change descent for an invariant cuspidal automorphic representation with respect to a solvable group of automorphisms of the field proved by the author in [\cite=R].

If either D is unramified at all finite places of E or if F is taken to be the field of rationals and the Galois closure L of E over [formula] is of odd order over [formula], then Theorem [\ref=constantcoeff] was proved by Clozel [\cite=C]. Clozel's proof uses the construction of algebraic Hecke characters due to Weil, and the automorphic induction of suitable such characters produces the desired cusp forms with non-zero cohomology. Clozel's method proves the non-vanishing of the cuspidal cohomology of the split groups SL2 over any number field E. But in order to produce cohomological forms on inner forms of SL2 using the Jacquet-Langlands theorem, it is required that the constructed cusp form on [formula] have discrete series components at the places of E where D ramifies, and thus the choice of D has to be suitably restricted.

A particular case of interest is the following:

With notation as in Theorem [\ref=constantcoeff], assume further that E has exactly one pair of conjugate complex places, and the quaternion division algebra D is ramified at all the real places of E. For sufficiently small congruence subgroups Γ  ⊂  G∞(E), the first betti number of the compact, hyperbolic three manifold [formula] is non-zero.

A folklore conjecture (attributed to Thurston) is that the first betti number of a compact, hyperbolic three manifold becomes positive upon going to some finite cover. The first examples of compact, hyperbolic arithmetic three manifolds MΓ with non-vanishing rational first homology group are due to Millson [\cite=M]. Using geometric arguments, Millson showed the non-vanishing of the first betti number for sufficiently small congruence subgroups, where the arithmetic structure arises from rank 4 quadratic forms over a totally real number field F, and of signature (3,1) at one archimedean place and anisotropic at all other real places. As mentioned above, other non-vanishing results confirming Thurston's conjecture have been proved by Labesse-Schwermer [\cite=LS] and Clozel [\cite=C].

Let L be a non-real Galois extension of [formula] with Galois group isomorphic to S4. Consider a subgroup H isomorphic to S3 and containing a complex conjugation σ corresponding to some archimedean place. Then the invariant field E = LH is a degree 4 extension of [formula] having the following properties:

E does not contain any quadratic extension of [formula].

E has at least one real place.

The subgroup containing the conjugates of σ with respect to S4 will not be equal to S3. Hence, E is not totally real.

This gives us an example of a field E satisfying the hypothesis of the corollary. The non-vanishing result for the corresponding hyperbolic three manifolds given by Corollary [\ref=thurston] are not in general covered by the non-vanishing results proved in [\cite=C], [\cite=LS] or in [\cite=M].

General coefficients

Theorem [\ref=constantcoeff] can be generalized for suitable non-trivial coefficient systems also. Let F and E be as in the hypothesis of the theorem. Given a finite dimensional complex representation V of [formula], we now define the base change representation Ψ(V) of the group G∞(E) [\cite=LS]. We define it first when V is irreducible and extend it additively. If V is irreducible, then V can be written as,

[formula]

where P∞(F) is the collection of the archimedean places of F, and the component Vv of V at the place v is an irreducible representation of [formula], say of dimension k(v).

Let Vk (resp. k) denote the irreducible, holomorphic (resp. anti-holomorphic) representation of [formula] of dimension k. Restricted to SU(2) they give raise to isomorphic representations, which we continue to denote by Vk. Define the representation Wk of [formula] by [formula].

Suppose D is a quaternion algebra over E. We define the base change coefficients Ψ(V) of G∞(E), as a tensor product of the representations Ψ(V)w of the component groups G(Ew), as w runs over the collection of archimedean places of E. Suppose w lies over a place v of F. Define,

[formula]

Restricting the representation Ψ(V) to a torsion-free lattice Γ gives raise to a well defined local system LΨ(V) on the manifold [formula]. The extension of Theorem [\ref=constantcoeff] to non-trivial coefficients is the following:

Let F be a totally real number field, and L be a solvable finite extension of F. Let E be a finite extension of F contained in L, and D be a quaternion division algebra over E. Let V be a finite dimensional complex representation of [formula]. Then,

[formula]

Proof

In order to prove Theorem [\ref=twistcoeff], it is more convenient to work with the cohomology groups H*(G,E;V), defined as a direct limit indexed by the compact open subgroups [formula]:

[formula]

These cohomology groups can be reinterpreted in terms of the automorphic spectrum of [formula]. Let ρ denote the representation of [formula] acting by right translations on the space [formula] consisting of square integrable functions on [formula]. This decomposes as a direct sum of irreducible admissible representations π of [formula] with finite multiplicity m(π):

[formula]

With respect to the decomposition [formula], write π  =  π∞πf, where π∞ (resp. πf) is a representation of G∞(E) (resp. [formula]). The cohomology groups H*(G,E;V) can also be expressed in terms of the relative Lie algebra cohomology (see [\cite=BW]) of the automorphic spectrum as,

[formula]

where [formula] is the Lie algebra of G∞(E). Hence in order to prove the theorem, it is enough to construct an irreducible representation π of [formula] with m(π) positive and such that [formula] is non-zero.

We can assume that V is irreducible of the form [formula]. Let D+k (resp. D-k) be the holomorphic (resp. antiholomorphic) discrete series of [formula] of weight k + 1. We have,

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] denotes respectively the Lie algebras of [formula] and [formula].

Let S be a finite set of finite places of F, containing all the finite places v of F dividing a finite place of E at which D ramifies. By [\cite=LS], there exists an irreducible, admissible representation of [formula] satisfying the following properties:

The multiplicity m0(π) of π occuring in the cuspidal spectrum [formula] consisting of square integrable cuspidal functions on [formula] is nonzero. Further π is stable in the sense of [\cite=LL].

The local component πv of π at an archimedean place v of F is a discrete series representation, with πv∈{D+k(v),D-k(v)}.

For any v∈S, the local component πv of π is isomorphic to the Steinberg representation of SL2(Fv).

Let Π be a cuspidal, automorphic representation of [formula], such that π occurs in the restriction of Π to [formula]. Let ΠL be the base change of Π to [formula] defined by Langlands in [\cite=L]. Since π is stable, i.e., Π is not automorphically induced from a character of a quadratic extension of F, ΠL is a cuspidal automorphic representation of [formula].

Let H be the Galois group of L over E. Since ΠL is H-invariant, by the descent criterion proved in [\cite=R], there exists an idele class character χ of L, such that the representation [formula] is the base change from E to L of a cuspidal representation ΠE of [formula]. Let πE be a constituent of the restriction of ΠE to [formula], and occuring in the automorphic spectrum [formula] with non-zero multiplicity m(πE).

Base change makes sense at the level of L-packets (see [\cite=LS]), and let [formula] denote the representation of [formula] obtained as base change of the L-packet {D+k,D-k} (L-packets for complex groups consist of only one element). It is known that (see [\cite=LS]),

[formula]

Let w be an archimedean place of E lying over a real place v of F. Now twisting by a character does not alter the restriction of an automorphic representation of GL2 to SL2. Hence if w is a real place of E, then the local component πE,w of πE at w belongs to {D+k(v),D-k(v)}, and if w is a complex place of E, then πE,w is isomorphic to [formula].

The local components of the base change to E of π continues to be the Steinberg representation of SL2(Ew), at the places of E where D ramifies. By the theorem of Jacquet-Langlands ([\cite=JL], [\cite=LS]) applied to L-packets of SL2 and it's inner forms, we get an automorphic representation JL(πE) of G over E. At a place w where D is ramified, the local component JL(πE)w is isomorphic to the restriction of the representation Vk(v) to SU(2), where v is a place of F dividing w. In particular, the zeroth relative Lie cohomology group

[formula]

At a place w of E where D splits, JL(πE)w≃πE,w, and hence the first relative Lie algebra cohomology with coefficients in the component of Ψ(V) at w is non-zero. It follows from equations ([\ref=coh-ds]), ([\ref=coh-sl2c]), ([\ref=coh-su2]) and by the Kunneth formula for the relative Lie algebra cohomology that

[formula]

By Equation ([\ref=coh-autspectrum]), this proves Theorem [\ref=twistcoeff].
