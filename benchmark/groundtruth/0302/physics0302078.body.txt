Negative heat capacity of sodium clusters

Introduction

Negative microcanonical heat capacity in atomic and molecular clusters was theoretically predicted by considering simple models of the distribution of local minima that characterize the potential energy landscape (PEL) of clusters [\cite=Bixon]. In that study, it was found that for high values of the parameter involving the ratios of the vibrational frequencies corresponding to the global and local isomers, the caloric curve displays an S-shaped loop, with a negative heat capacity in the vicinity of the melting point [\cite=Bixon]. In another study on the solid-liquid transition of clusters [\cite=Labas], it was shown that in microcanonical simulations of Lennard-Jones clusters, an increase in total energy causes a temperature reduction. This effect was related to the broadening of the cluster kinetic-energy distribution toward lower energy values [\cite=Labas].

Although the existence of negative heat capacity in physical systems like stars or star clusters [\cite=Thirring] [\cite=Bell], and in fragmenting nuclei [\cite=Gross] [\cite=Agostino] is well-known, this peculiar effect gained a lot of interest in the field of atomic and molecular clusters due to recent experimental results where a negative heat capacity was measured for a 147-atom sodium cluster [\cite=Schmidt]. In this study, the photofragmentation mass spectra was used to measure the internal energy of free, mass selected clusters with known temperature. These measurements were used to determine the microcanonical caloric curve of the Na+147 that shows the characteristic S-shaped (backbending) feature, indicating a negative heat capacity [\cite=Schmidt]. The negative value of the microcanonical heat capacity was interpreted by considering that a finite system upon melting tries to avoid partly molten states and prefers to convert some of its kinetic energy into potential energy [\cite=Schmidt] [\cite=Schmidt1]. This peculiarity has been attributed to the non-additivity of the total energy of a cluster with finite size [\cite=Schmidt] [\cite=Schmidt1].

Microcanonical heat capacities of metal clusters have been theoretically investigated using constant-energy molecular dynamics (MD) with many-body potentials [\cite=Gallego] [\cite=Calvo] [\cite=Jell] and an orbital-free version of the first-principles MD method [\cite=Agua1] [\cite=Agua2]. In these studies, heat capacities of fcc transition and noble metal clusters with up to 23 atoms were calculated to characterize their melting-like transition [\cite=Gallego]. In another study, on the melting of sodium clusters [\cite=Calvo], the microcanonical caloric curve of the Na55 cluster was obtained. However, in not one of these studies was a signature of a negative heat capacity found. Similar results, indicating the non-existence of a negative heat capacity in constant-energy orbital-free first-principles MD simulations of larger sodium clusters (Na55, Na92, and Na142), were obtained [\cite=Agua2]. Nevertheless, in such calculations the simulation time employed was too short to obtain converged results [\cite=Agua2]. On the other hand, in microcanonical MD simulations of AlN, N = 7, 13, 55, and 147, clusters, a negative heat capacity was obtained for the larger Al147 cluster [\cite=Jell].

In the present work, motivated by the availability of experimental techniques that allow the measurement of the microcanonical heat capacity and other thermal properties of mass selected metal clusters [\cite=Haber1] [\cite=Haber2] [\cite=Haber3], we theoretically investigate the behavior of the heat capacity of sodium clusters in the size range of 13-147 atoms. In our approach, constant-energy MD simulations are performed using a phenomenological many-body potential that mimics the metallic bonding of sodium clusters. This approximation allows us to use simulation times of the order of ~   50 ns, in order to obtain converged averages of the microcanonical heat capacity and other cluster thermal properties. Our main objective is to gain additional insights into the conditions that determine if a cluster has a negative heat capacity. The main finding of this work shows that the width of the distribution function of the kinetic energy and the spread of the distribution of the potential energy minima (isomers), characterizing the PEL, are useful features to determine the signature of the cluster heat capacity. In section II, we provide the theoretical background on which this study is based. The results and their discussion are given in section III, and section IV contains a summary and the conclusions of this work.

Theoretical background

The heat capacity and temperature of sodium clusters as a function of the cluster total energy are calculated through constant-energy MD simulations using the microcanonical expressions derived in Refs. [\cite=Pearson] [\cite=Sugano]:

[formula]

[formula]

where K is the kinetic energy of the cluster, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and 〈...〉 denotes a time average. In these formulas, 3N was changed to 3N-6, the number of degrees of freedom of the system, since the calculations are performed for a non-translating and non-rotating cluster in a three-dimensional space (the position of the center of mass was fixed and the total momentum was held to zero during the simulations).

In our implementation of the constant-energy MD method, the Newton's equations of motion are solved with the Verlet algorithm [\cite=Verlet] using a time step of 2.4 fs, which provides total energy conservation within 0.001 %. A typical calculation consists in heating up a cluster from its lowest-energy solid-like configuration until it transforms into a liquid-like cluster. To simulate this procedure the cluster total energy is increased in a step-like manner by scaling up the atomic velocities. For each initial condition the cluster was equilibrated during 104 time steps and the time averages of the physical quantities are calculated using 107 time steps. This averaging time is increased by a factor of 2 when the cluster is in the region of the solid-to-liquid transition in order to ensure the calculation of fully converged averages.

To model the metallic bonding in sodium clusters we used the many-body Gupta potential [\cite=Gupta], which is based on the second moment approximation of a tight-binding hamiltonian [\cite=Cleri]. Its analytical expression is given by:

[formula]

[formula]

where r0, A, ξ, p, and q are adjustable parameters [\cite=Cleri]. For sodium clusters these parameters have been fitted to band structure calculations [\cite=Li]. Their values are: A=0.01595 eV, ξ=0.29113 eV, r0=6.99 bohr, p=10.13, and q=1.30 [\cite=Li]. This phenomelogical many-body potential has been used to study the melting-like transition in sodium clusters of different sizes using Monte Carlo (MC) [\cite=Calvo] and constant-energy MD simulations [\cite=Reyes]. A good qualitative agreement has been obtained between structural and thermal properties calculated using the Gupta potential [\cite=Calvo] [\cite=Reyes] and those generated from first-principles methods [\cite=Agua1] [\cite=Agua2]. An additional advantage in using this potential is that it allows simulation times of the order of 50 ns, necessary to obtain fully converged time averages in the melting-like transition region.

Results and Discussion

The microcanonical heat capacities of the NaN, N = 13, 20, 55, 135, 142, and 147, clusters, calculated using Eq. (1), are displayed in Fig. [\ref=Fig1]. For N = 13, 20, and 55, they are continuous functions of the cluster total energy showing a maximum value that is characteristic of a melting-like transition [\cite=Calvo] [\cite=Agua1] [\cite=Agua2] [\cite=Reyes]. On the other hand, the heat capacity of the larger clusters (N = 135, 142, and 147) shows two discontinuity points and a continuous negative-valued interval between them. This peculiar behavior in the heat capacity is related with a backbending loop in the caloric curve (temperature as a function of the total energy) [\cite=Bixon] [\cite=Labas] [\cite=Wales1] [\cite=Wales]. In fact, our calculated microcanonical caloric curves of Na135, Na142, and Na147 show the backbending loop at the same energies where the heat capacity takes negative values (see the caloric curves shown in Fig. 2 of Ref. [\cite=Reyes]). In previous studies, the negative slope (backbending loop) of the microcanonical caloric curve has been attributed to a peculiar behavior of the cluster entropy as a function of energy that shows a dent with inverted curvature in the region of the solid-liquid transition [\cite=Bixon] [\cite=Labas] [\cite=Schmidt] [\cite=Schmidt1] [\cite=Wales].

In the present work, we analyze the behavior of the microcanonical heat capacity of sodium clusters from a different perspective. First, we consider Eq. (1) and obtain the condition to have a negative value in the heat capacity:

[formula]

Figure [\ref=Fig2] display the values of ZE (black dots) as a function of the cluster total energy E that were calculated from a time average, using the MD trajectories. In the same scale the threshold value [formula] for each cluster size is given. In Fig. [\ref=Fig2] , it can be graphically seen how the relative difference between ZE and Zc changes with the cluster size. For the three smaller clusters (see panels (a), (b), and (c) in Fig. [\ref=Fig2] ) the ZE values do not overcome the threshold value, whereas for the three larger clusters there is a range of total energy where ZE satisfy the condition to have negative heat capacities (see panels (d), (e), and (f) in Fig. [\ref=Fig2] ).

In order to investigate what determines a negative value of the heat capacity, we consider the quantity ZE. This is the product of the averages of the kinetic energy and of the inverse of this quantity, and therefore, its value will depend on the distribution function of the kinetic energy, gE(K). The average of any function of the kinetic energy f(K) can be obtained through the following expression:

[formula]

Since the distribution function of the kinetic energy, gE(K), determines the behavior of ZE, it is useful to analyze gE(K) at different values of the cluster total energy E. The calculation of this quantity is straightforward from the constant-energy MD simulations. Figure [\ref=Fig3] shows gE as a function of the normalized mean deviation δK = (K - 〈K〉)/ 〈K〉 for three different energies, corresponding to the cases where the cluster is in the solid- and liquid-like phases, and at the middle of the melting-like transition. The analysis of gE as a function of δK, instead of K, has the advantage that it allows the comparison, on the same scale, of the lineshapes of this function at different cluster energies and for different cluster sizes.

As a general trend, it is found that gE becomes narrower for increasing cluster sizes, indicating a larger relative dispersion of the kinetic energy values for the smaller clusters. This result is expected since it confirms the increment of fluctuations in kinetic energy of a physical system that decrease in size. A common characteristic of gE, existing in the six clusters investigated, is the larger broadening of the distribution function when the cluster is at the melting-like transition. At lower (solid-like phase) and higher (liquid-like phase) energies, the width of gE is smaller, whereas at the phase transition the fluctuations in kinetic energy, as expected, should increase.

For the three smaller clusters which do not have negative heat capacity, gE(δK) shows a nearly symmetric lineshape independent of the cluster energy (see panels (a), (b), and (c) of Fig. [\ref=Fig3] ). In contrast, Na142 and Na147, that show a negative heat capacity, have a distribution function gE(δK) with a shoulder towards positive values of δK, at energies in the middle of the melting region (see panels (e) and (f) of Fig. [\ref=Fig3] ). Although this difference in the distribution function of the kinetic energy could be a useful feature to determine the existence of a negative heat capacity, the Na135 cluster would be an exception to this rule since its gE(δK) does not show a resolved shoulder in its lineshape (see panel (d) in Fig. [\ref=Fig3]), but it has negative heat capacity.

On the other hand, a characteristic of gE that would be useful to determine the sign of the heat capacity is the width of the distribution function, which can be obtained through its second moment:

[formula]

The second moment of gE corresponds to the second term in the expansion of ZE, which can be obtained from the left hand term of Eq. (5) [\cite=Pearson] [\cite=Sugano]:

[formula]

By taking terms up to second order in this expansion, assuming that 〈δK〉g <  < 1, ZE can be approximated by:

[formula]

Since the Z(2)E values can be calculated using gE and Eq. (7), it is possible to check the validity of this approximation, which can only be applied to systems with a finite number of particles. Fig. [\ref=Fig2] shows the values of Z(2)E (stars) as a function of the cluster energy. It can be seen that the difference with ZE is small for the three smaller clusters and negligible for the three larger ones. Then, Z(2)E can be considered as a quantitative measure of the width (second moment) of the distribution function of the kinetic energy, and can be used to determine the sign of the heat capacity. Figure [\ref=Fig4] shows the maximum values of Z(2)E (black dots) calculated for energies at the middle of the melting transition, and their comparison with the threshold values Zc as a function of the cluster size (full line). From this figure, it is obvious that although the width of gE is relatively large for the three smaller clusters, the corresponding maximum values of Z(2)E are below the threshold Zc, and therefore these clusters do not show a negative heat capacity. On the other hand, the width of gE for Na135, Na142, and Na147 is smaller than for Na13, Na20, and Na55, however, Zc is a faster decreasing function of the cluster size N, such that the maximum of Z(2)E lies above the threshold values, indicating that the larger clusters have negative heat capacities. Then, the above results suggest that the width of the distribution function of the kinetic energy is a useful property to determine the sign of the heat capacity of clusters. However, this quantity not only depends on the cluster size, but also on the characteristics of the PEL.

To illustrate the importance of the topology of the PEL we have investigated the behavior of the heat capacity of 55-atom clusters using the many-body Gupta potential [\cite=Gupta], shown in Eqs. (3) and (4), for the different metals listed in Tables I and III of Ref. [\cite=Cleri], and in Table II of Ref. [\cite=Li]. Our results show that the Cd55 cluster (with the following parameter values [\cite=Cleri]: A=0.0416 eV, ξ=0.4720 eV, p=13.639, and q=3.908) has a negative heat capacity, but none of the other 55-atom clusters show this peculiarity. The upper insets of Fig. [\ref=Fig4] show the calculated caloric curve with the corresponding backbending loop and the heat capacity with negative values for a range of total energy values of the Cd55 cluster. The inset at the lower right corner of Fig. 4 shows gE as a function of the normalized mean deviation of the kinetic energy for both, the Na55 and Cd55, clusters. It can be seen that the broadening of gE is larger in Cd55 than in Na55, such that, it generates a maximum value of Z(2)E (this value corresponds to the point represented by a star in Fig. 4) that overcome the threshold Zc, and consequently, the Cd55 cluster display a negative heat capacity. This comparison with the Na55 cluster which does not show this peculiarity, indicates that although both clusters have the same size, their dynamical properties defined by their corresponding PEL's, generate different behavior in their heat capacities.

In order to investigate the influence of the PEL on the different widths of the distribution function of the kinetic energy of the Na55 and Cd55 clusters, further studies are necessary. In this direction, the calculation of short-time averages of the kinetic energy and periodic quenchings of instantaneous configurations during the MD trajectories allow us to obtain the distribution of potential energy minima (isomers) that are accessible at different cluster energies [\cite=Wales1]. Figure [\ref=Fig5] display the normalized distribution of potential energy minima, obtained by periodical quenchings using MD trajectories at a total energy where the cluster is at the middle of the melting transition, for the Na55 and Cd55 clusters. It can be notice that the number of isomers with higher energy relative to the global minimum, are larger for the Cd55 cluster in comparison with the results obtained for Na55. This result can be explained by taking into account that the range of the interatomic forces is shorter in Cd than in Na clusters, mainly due to the higher value of the q parameter in the many-body Gupta potential [\cite=Karo3]. The physical reason for the larger number of minima at short range is the loss of accessible configuration space as the potential wells become narrower, thus producing barriers where there are none at long range [\cite=Doye].

To show how the distribution of potential energy minima determine the broadening of the distribution function of the kinetic energy, we approximate the complex topology of the PEL by a set of independent harmonic potential wells in the 3N - 6 dimensional space. Each one of these wells is associated to the different potential energy minima forming the distribution of isomers shown in Fig. 5. For each potential energy minimum denoted by l, the distribution function of the kinetic energy at a total energy E, in the harmonic approximation, is given by [\cite=Labas] [\cite=Pearson]:

[formula]

where Δl is the potential energy of the isomer l, relative to the potential energy value of the lowest-energy isomer, and Cl is a normalization constant such that:

[formula]

The distribution function of the kinetic energy gE,har, at a total energy E, corresponding to the whole PEL can be constructed by adding up the contribution of each harmonic potential well, weighted by the probability, ωE,l, of finding a given isomer during the quenching from the MD trajectories. This probability is given by the height of the distribution shown in Fig. 5. Then, gE,har is given by:

[formula]

with

[formula]

By using the data from the whole distribution of isomers in Fig. 5, the distribution function of the kinetic energy gE,har was calculated for the Cd55 and Na55 clusters. They are displayed in the insets of Fig. 5 (full lines). A comparison between gE,har and the exact gE (obtained from the MD simulation and displayed in the lower right inset of Fig. 4) shows that there is a good agreement between the two distribution functions. This indicates that gE is determined mainly from the number of isomers and the probability to found them (height of the distribution), rather than from other features of the PEL like saddle points. The advantage in introducing gE,har in this discussion is related with the fact that it is possible to analyze the broadening of this distribution function of the kinetic energy by considering different subsets of potential energy minima (isomers). This is useful to determine what regions of the PEL are more relevant to increase the width of gE,har, and investigate the appearance of the negative heat capacity. The insets of Fig. 5 show three partial distribution functions gE,har, considering different subsets of isomers corresponding to three intervals of low (L), medium (M) and high (H) potential energy values. By analyzing the relative contribution of these subsets to the width of gE,har for the Cd55 and Na55 clusters, it is found that the larger broadening in the cadmium cluster is mainly due to the larger contribution of the isomers in the range of high potential energy which are spreaded along a larger interval than those corresponding to the Na55 cluster. The width of gE,har for the Na55 cluster is smaller since there are proportionally less isomers with high potential energy, and they are extended over a shorter interval of values. As was mentioned above, the physical reason for this difference in the distribution of isomers between the Cd55 and Na55 clusters is the shorter range of the many-body forces existing in the cadmium cluster as compared with those present in the sodium cluster. A similar result was obtained for 55-atom clusters using a pairwise Morse potential for different values of the range of the interatomic forces [\cite=Doye]. In that case the backbending loop in the caloric curve (negative heat capacity) was obtained using a Morse potential with a range of the interatomic forces that is shorter than the range characteristic of alkali metals which have long-ranged interactions [\cite=Doye].

Therefore, if a detailed characterization of the distribution of isomers forming the PEL of clusters is performed, the broadening of gE may be estimated, and by the comparison of the corresponding Z(2)E and Zc values, it would be possible to predict the sign of the heat capacity of clusters.

Summary

The microcanonical heat capacity of sodium clusters has been calculated using constant-energy MD simulations and the many-body Gupta potential. Negative values for the heat capacity at energies where the cluster is at the melting-like transition were found for Na135, Na142, and Na147. The smaller sodium clusters NaN, N=13, 20, and 55, do not show this peculiarity. An analysis of the calculated distribution function of the kinetic energy gE for the six clusters investigated, shows that the width of this distribution function is a useful feature to determine the sign of the heat capacity. It was found, that although the broadening of gE is larger for the smaller clusters, it is not enough to overcome the corresponding threshold value to obtain a negative heat capacity. However, since this threshold is a fast decreasing function of the cluster size, the broadening of gE in the larger clusters is enough to generate a negative heat capacity.

It was also shown that the broadening of gE depends on the distribution of potential energy minima that characterize the PEL of clusters. Specifically, as the range of the many-body interactions is decreased (like in the case of Cd clusters), the number of local minima with higher energy increases generating a larger broadening in gE, and consequently a negative heat capacity. The analysis presented in this paper shows how the complex topology of the PEL can be explored to extract the main features that determine the sign of the heat capacity of metal clusters.
