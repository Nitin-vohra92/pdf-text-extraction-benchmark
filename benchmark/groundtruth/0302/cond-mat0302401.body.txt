The high temperature region of the Viana-Bray diluted spin glass model

Introduction

Diluted mean field spin glasses attract a great interest among physicists and probabilists, for at least two reasons. First of all, due to their finite degree of connectivity, they represent a sort of intermediate situation between fully connected models and realistic spin glasses with finite range interactions. Secondly, many random optimization problems arising in theoretical computer science are mapped in a natural way into the study of the ground state of diluted mean field spin glass models. The mean field character of these systems makes them exactly solvable, at least in the framework of Parisi theory of replica symmetry breaking [\cite=MPV]. Recently, many results have been obtained in this direction, culminating in the resolution of the K-sat model within the framework of "one-step replica symmetry breaking" in [\cite=1RSB]. Much less is know from the rigorous point of view, two remarkable exceptions being Refs. [\cite=franz-leone] and [\cite=talaksat]. In [\cite=franz-leone], through a suitable extension of the interpolation methods introduced in [\cite=limterm] and [\cite=broken] for fully connected models, S. Franz and M. Leone proved, for a wide class of diluted models, that the thermodynamic limit for the free energy density exists, and that it is bounded below by Parisi solution with replica symmetry breaking. In Ref. [\cite=talaksat], instead, M. Talagrand proved that replica symmetry holds for sufficiently high temperature or low average connectivity.

In the present work we concentrate on the case of the Viana-Bray model [\cite=viana], [\cite=kanter], where each spin interacts through two body couplings of random sign with a finite random number of other spins, even in the infinite volume limit. This is a diluted version of the well known Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model [\cite=sk] [\cite=MPV]. We identify the replica symmetric region, and we obtain a complete control of the system there. In particular, through a suitable extension of the "quadratic replica coupling method" we introduced in [\cite=quadratic], we prove that annealing holds for the free energy, in the infinite volume limit. Moreover, as in [\cite=CLT], we prove limit theorems for the fluctuations of (multi)-overlaps and of the free energy. While the fluctuations of the multi-overlaps on the scale [formula] turn out to be Gaussian in the infinite volume limit, like for the SK model, free energy fluctuations (on the scale 1 / N) tend to a non-Gaussian random variable, whose variance diverges at the boundary of the replica symmetric region.

The organization of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we give the basic definitions concerning the model, and in Section 3 we discuss the role played by the multi-overlaps in its thermodynamical description. The relationship between the model under consideration and the fully connected one is considered in Section 4. In Sections 5 and 6, we identify the replica symmetric region and we prove annealing for the free energy. Finally, in Sections 7 and 8 we prove limit theorems for the fluctuations in the annealed region, while Section 9 is dedicated to conclusions and outlook to future developments.

Definition of the model

The Hamiltonian of the Viana-Bray model [\cite=viana], for a given configuration of the N Ising spin variables [formula], is defined as

[formula]

Here, ξαN is a Poisson random variable of mean value αN, for some α > 0, i.e.,

[formula]

while {Jμ} is a family of independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) symmetric random variables, and iμ,jμ are i.i.d. integer valued random variables, uniformly distributed on the set [formula]. We denote by J the dependence of the Hamiltonian on the whole set of quenched disordered variables ξαN,Jμ,iμ,jμ. The parameter α fixes the average degree of connectivity of the system. Indeed the number of different sites, which interact with a given spin variable, behaves approximately like a Poisson random variable of parameter 2α, for large values of N. This is to be compared with the case of the SK model, where any spin interacts with all the other N - 1. A second important difference with respect to the SK model is that, in the present case, the infinite volume limit of the system does depend on the probability distribution ρ(J) of Jμ. In the case ρ(J) = 1 / 2(δ(J - 1) + δ(J + 1)), the Viana-Bray model is closely related to the so called 2-XOR-SAT problem [\cite=xor-sat] of computer science. In the course of this work, we do not specify the form of ρ(J), but for simplicity we assume J to be a bounded random variable

[formula]

More general cases can be considered, at the expense of some additional technical work.

The partition function ZN(β,α;J), the disorder dependent free energy fN(β,α;J), the Gibbs state ωJ and the quenched free energy -  βAN(β,α) are defined in the usual way, for a given value of the inverse temperature β:

[formula]

Here, O is a generic function of the spin variables, and E denotes expectation with respect to all quenched random variables:

[formula]

Like in the case of fully connected models, it is possible to prove that fN(β,α;J) is self-averaging when the system size grows to infinity, and to give bounds, exponentially small in N, on the probability of its fluctuations. The precise result is stated and proved in Appendix A.

As usual, one introduces real replicas as independent identical copies of the system, subject to the same disorder realization, and denotes with ΩJ(.) the disorder dependent product Gibbs state

[formula]

where the state ω(a)J acts on the a-th replica. Moreover, the average 〈.〉, involving both thermal and disorder averages, is defined as

[formula]

A very important role is played by the multi-overlaps between n configurations [formula], defined as

[formula]

Of course,

[formula]

Notice that for n = 2 one recovers the usual definition of the overlap as normalized scalar product between two configurations.

While for fully connected models the whole physical content of the theory is encoded in the probability distribution of the overlaps [\cite=MPV], all multi-overlaps play an essential role in the present case [\cite=viana], [\cite=kanter]. In Section 4 we will show how, when the limit of infinite connectivity is suitably performed, the multi-overlaps with n > 2 become inessential.

The role of the multi-overlaps

An important ingredient of the methods employed in [\cite=franz-leone] is a smart use of the properties of the Poisson random variables. Indeed, while the choice of the Poisson distribution for the number ξαN of terms appearing in the Hamiltonian ([\ref=H]) is in principle not essential (any other random variable sharply concentrated around the value αN would yield an equivalent model, in the infinite volume limit), it turns out to be a great technical simplification. The basic elementary properties one employs, for the distribution function of a Poisson random variable ξλ of parameter λ > 0, are

[formula]

and

[formula]

In a sense, Eq. ([\ref=prop1]) replaces the identity

[formula]

which plays a fundamental role in the study of the fully connected models, and which holds for any smooth function F if J is a Gaussian standard random variable.

For instance, let us show how Eq. ([\ref=prop1]) allows to express the internal energy of the Viana-Bray model as a sum of simple averages involving multi-overlaps. For an analogous computation, see Ref. [\cite=franz-leone]. One has

[formula]

where 〈.〉k denotes the average where the value of the random variable ξαN has been fixed to k. Then, using property ([\ref=prop1]),

[formula]

Now, we use the identity

[formula]

to rewrite ([\ref=then]) as

[formula]

where J is independent of the couplings Jμ on which ωJ depends. Notice that we have employed the identity

[formula]

in the last step. Thanks to ([\ref=jbounded]), | tanh (βJ)|  ≤   tanh β < 1 so that the expression in ([\ref=now]) can be expanded in absolutely convergent Taylor series around tanh (βJ) = 0. Recalling the definition of the multi-overlaps and the symmetry of the random variable J, one finally finds

[formula]

In the particular case where Jμ  =    ±  1, the above expression reduces to

[formula]

The infinite connectivity limit and the SK model

In this section, we discuss the relationship between the Viana-Bray and the fully connected SK model. As it was already observed in [\cite=viana] [\cite=kanter], the latter is obtained when the average connectivity α tends to infinity, provided that the strength of the couplings Jμ, or equivalently the inverse temperature, is suitably rescaled to zero. Let us discuss this point in greater detail. To this purpose, recall that the SK model in zero external field is defined by the Hamiltonian

[formula]

where the couplings Jij are i.i.d. centered Gaussian random variables of unit variance. Now, we want to compare the Viana-Bray model, with parameters β and α, with the SK model, at an inverse temperature β' defined as

[formula]

In particular we show that, in the limit α  →    ∞  , β  →  0 with β' = const, one has

[formula]

To this purpose, let [formula] and define an auxiliary partition function ZN(t) as

[formula]

Of course, for t = 1 one recovers the partition function ([\ref=Z]) of the diluted model, while for t = 0 one has the partition function of the fully connected model, at inverse temperature β'. The t derivative of 1 / NE ln ZN(t) can be performed along the lines of the computation of ∂βAN(β,α) in the previous section, with the result

[formula]

The term ([\ref=a1]) derives from the t dependence of the Poisson random variable ξαNt in ([\ref=Zt]), while ([\ref=a2]) comes from the [formula] factor which multiplies the SK Hamiltonian. Before we proceed, let us notice that we have proved the inequality, uniform in N,

[formula]

whose implications will be discussed below. Now, it is easy to see that the t derivative we are considering vanishes for [formula], α  →    ∞  , if the constraint ([\ref=beta']) is satisfied. Indeed, for α  →    ∞   Eq. ([\ref=beta']) reduces to

[formula]

so that

[formula]

and

[formula]

which concludes the proof of ([\ref=rapporto]). [formula]

The replica symmetric bound and the annealed region

In [\cite=broken] it was proven that the Parisi solution for the SK model, with an arbitrary number of levels of replica symmetry breaking, is a lower bound for the free energy, at any temperature. Along the same lines, this result was extended in [\cite=franz-leone] to the case of diluted models. In this context, one has to face the additional difficulty that, even at the level of the replica symmetric approximation, the Parisi order parameter is a function [\cite=kanter] (the probability distribution of the effective field) rather than a single number, as it happens instead for fully connected models [\cite=MPV]. In the present section, we recall briefly the replica symmetric bound for the Viana-Bray model under consideration, and we discuss the high temperature or low connectivity phase, where this bound actually gives the correct limit.

Let g be an arbitrary symmetric random variable (we assume its distribution to be regular enough to guarantee that all expressions below are well defined), and define the random variable u as

[formula]

Here, J is distributed like any of the couplings Jμ and is independent of them (as well as of g). For given β and α, the replica symmetric trial functional FRS(β,α;g) is defined as

[formula]

Here, [formula] are independent copies of u and g1,g2 are independent copies of g. Then, one has [\cite=franz-leone]

[formula]

where the infimum is taken over the space of symmetric random variables g. It is not difficult to see, computing the functional derivative of FRS(β,α;g) with respect to the probability distribution P(g) of g, that a sufficient condition of extremality for the replica symmetric functional is [\cite=kanter]

[formula]

where the equality holds in distribution. It is clear that the above equation always admits the trivial solution g concentrated at the value zero, i.e., with P(g) = δ(g). In this case,

[formula]

which corresponds to take the expectation with respect to the the random coupling signs before the logarithm, in the definition ([\ref=AN]) of AN(β,α):

[formula]

In the following, we call - 1 / βFRS(β,α;0) the "annealed free energy". The following result shows that, in a certain region of the parameters β and α, the trivial solution of ([\ref=self-cons]) is actually the only one:

If

[formula]

the only symmetric random variable g satisfying equation ([\ref=self-cons]) is the degenerate one: P(g) = δ(g).

Notice that, for α < 1 / 2, the annealed region extends up to β  =    ∞  .

Proof of Proposition [\ref=prop:contraz]. Let

[formula]

be the characteristic function of g, which can be rewritten, thanks to condition ([\ref=self-cons]), as

[formula]

This implies that

[formula]

where we used the fact that

[formula]

as it easily follows from ([\ref=self-cons]) and from [formula]. Now, one can iterate the procedure, replacing the random variable g which appears at the right hand side of ([\ref=primopasso]) with the expression given by Eq. ([\ref=self-cons]), and so on. At the n-th step of the iteration one has the bound

[formula]

which goes to zero when n  →    ∞  , if condition ([\ref=ann_reg]) holds. [formula]

On the other hand it is easy to realize that, outside the annealed region, the choice of the identically vanishing g does not realize the infimum in ([\ref=boundRS]). Indeed, consider even the simple case of a two-valued random variable g with distribution

[formula]

When g0≃0, one finds

[formula]

which is negative if ([\ref=ann_reg]) does not hold.

It is interesting to observe that breaking of annealing outside the region ([\ref=ann_reg]) can also be proved through a comparison with the SK model. Indeed, integration of the inequality ([\ref=uniform]) with respect to t between 0 and 1 gives

[formula]

i.e., the difference between the quenched and the annealed free energies is larger (in absolute value) for the diluted model than for its fully connected counterpart if β,α and β' are related by the condition ([\ref=beta']). Therefore, since it is well known that

[formula]

for β' > 1, one has immediately breakdown of annealing for the Viana-Bray model, when β'2 = 2αE tanh 2(βJ) > 1.

Control of the annealed region

In the present section we prove that annealing actually holds for the Viana-Bray model in the region of parameters ([\ref=ann_reg]), i.e., that

For 2αE tanh 2(βJ) < 1,

[formula]

We prove the theorem via a suitable adaptation of the "quadratic replica coupling" method we introduced in [\cite=quadratic] for the SK model. While the above result can also be obtained through the "second moment method" [\cite=talagcorso], which consists in showing that

[formula]

the quadratic method we employ allows us to obtain self-averaging of the multi-overlaps in a stronger form, and to prove limit theorems for the fluctuations, as shown in the next two sections.

Consider a system of two coupled replicas of the model, defined by the partition function

[formula]

where λ  ≥  0. Notice that the quadratic interaction gives a large weight to the pairs of configurations whose overlap is different from zero. Like in [\cite=quadratic] the idea is to show that, if λ is not too large, the interaction does not modify the infinite volume free energy density, so that q12 must be typically close to zero. Indeed, we can prove

In the region

[formula]

one has

[formula]

and

[formula]

Of course, this result implies the previous Theorem 2 since, for λ = 0,

[formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=teoaccopp]. First of all, since [\cite=franz-leone]

[formula]

and

[formula]

one can write

[formula]

Therefore, using convexity of ln Z(2)N with respect to λ and the identity

[formula]

one has

[formula]

Next, we need an upper bound for 1 / (2N)E ln Z(2)N. To this purpose, we take λ to depend on α as λ(α) = λ0  -  2αE tanh 2(βJ), and we compute

[formula]

where we employed Eq. ([\ref=prop2]) and the symmetry of J. Here, the averages refer to the coupled system with parameters α,λ(α). Then,

[formula]

where we used Jensen's inequality to take expectation inside the logarithm, and the elementary estimate

[formula]

Therefore, integrating between 0 and α one has

[formula]

since at α = 0 only the quadratic replica coupling survives in the Hamiltonian. At this point, the proof proceeds exactly like in [\cite=quadratic]: one introduces an auxiliary Gaussian standard random variable z with probability distribution

[formula]

and performs a simple rescaling, to write

[formula]

For λ0  =  λ + 2αE tanh 2(βJ) < 1, one can employ the inequality

[formula]

to deduce, from Eqs. ([\ref=integrando]) and ([\ref=asdf]),

[formula]

so that Eq. ([\ref=sothat]) reduces to

[formula]

As in [\cite=quadratic], this implies

[formula]

since

[formula]

Statement ([\ref=stat1]) then follows if one notices that, thanks to ([\ref=boundsup]), ([\ref=stat0]) and to monotonicity of the free energy with respect to λ,

[formula]

in the region ([\ref=triangular]). Finally, statement ([\ref=stat2]) follows from ([\ref=stat1]) and from convexity of E ln Z(2)N with respect to λ. [formula]

Multi-overlap fluctuations in the annealed region

In the previous section, we proved that the multi-overlap among any 2n configurations [formula] is typically small, in the annealed region. To study the infinite volume behavior of the multi-overlap fluctuations, we define

[formula]

(Due to symmetry under permutation of the indices ai, we will always assume them to be ordered as [formula].) Then, like for the SK model at high temperature [\cite=comets], [\cite=CLT], [\cite=T], one can prove that the rescaled (multi)-overlaps behave like independent centered Gaussian variables, in the infinite volume limit. Indeed, we prove the following

In the annealed region ([\ref=ann_reg]), the variables [formula] converge in distribution, as N  →    ∞  , to a centered Gaussian process [formula] with covariances

[formula]

Remark Notice that, when the boundary of the annealed region ([\ref=ann_reg]) is approached, only the variance of ηa1a2 diverges.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=teoflutq]. For simplicity, here we prove only that

[formula]

The generalization ([\ref=covarianze1]) to n > 1 and the proof of the independence ([\ref=covarianze2])-([\ref=covarianze3]) of the limit random variables, though technically heavier, present no additional conceptual difficulty.

The proof is based on the cavity method [\cite=MPV] (see [\cite=guerracav], [\cite=talaRSB] and, in particular, [\cite=talaksat]), which in essence consists in analyzing what happens when one removes one of the spins, thereby transforming the original system into one of size N - 1. As in [\cite=CLT], the idea is to write down a linear differential equation for φN(u), in the thermodynamic limit. First of all, using symmetry among sites one can write

[formula]

Notice that, thanks to Theorem [\ref=teoaccopp] of the previous section,

[formula]

uniformly in N. Then, defining

[formula]

one has

[formula]

where the term o(1), vanishing for N  →    ∞  , arises from the expansion of [formula] around u = 0 and from the replacement u'  →  u. Now consider the set

[formula]

where iμ,jμ are the random site indices appearing in ([\ref=H]). Since the probability of A is very close to one,

[formula]

one can write

[formula]

where 1A is the indicator function of the set A. Next, we single out all terms - JνσiνσN in the Hamiltonian ([\ref=H]) involving the N-th spin (the number of these terms is a Poisson variable ξ2α of mean value 2α) and we rewrite ([\ref=intermedio]) as

[formula]

where Av denotes average on the two-valued unbiased variables [formula] and Ω'(.) is the Gibbs average for a system with N - 1 spins and connectivity parameter α' = α(1 - 1 / (N - 1)). Of course, since we are restricting to the set A, the indices iν are i.i.d. random variables uniformly distributed on [formula]. Now, we show that the denominator B in ([\ref=AB]) can be replaced by the random variable

[formula]

by neglecting an error term which vanishes in the thermodynamic limit. To this purpose we use the obvious identity

[formula]

as it was done in [\cite=talaRSB]. As we will show below, the last term in the r.h.s. vanishes for N  →    ∞  . The first term is easily computed. Indeed, recalling the mutual independence of the variables Jν,iν and using the formula

[formula]

which holds for [formula] if ξλ is a Poisson random variable of mean λ, one finds

[formula]

Then, expanding the [formula] at first order around zero and recalling that

[formula]

one has

[formula]

As for the second term in ([\ref=identita]), one finds again

[formula]

Finally, we show that the last term can be neglected. First of all, one has

[formula]

as it follows from Jensen inequality, interchanging the thermal average Ω' and the exponential in the definition of B. Therefore,

[formula]

The computation of ([\ref=83]) proceeds in analogy with that of EA / . In this case, however, one finds that the dominant term in the Taylor expansion is of order

[formula]

Therefore, recalling Eqs. ([\ref=identita]), ([\ref=pezzo1]), ([\ref=pezzo2]), together with Eq. ([\ref=quasi]), we find that φN(u) solves the linear differential equation

[formula]

which, together with the obvious initial condition

[formula]

implies the result ([\ref=semplicita]). [formula]

Free energy fluctuations

Is easy to realize that the Viana-Bray model resembles locally a spin glass model on a tree, where the number of branches starting at each node is a Poisson random variable of parameter 2α and the couplings associated to the branches are i.i.d. random variables Jμ. The non-triviality of the Viana-Bray model arises from the presence of loops of length O( ln N) in the underlying graph. For the model on the tree, the computation of the partition function for any disorder realization is elementary,

[formula]

so that

[formula]

Theorem [\ref=teoannealing] shows that, in the annealed region, the Viana-Bray model behaves like its tree-like counterpart, as far as only the infinite volume limit of the free energy density is concerned. However, the difference between the two models becomes evident if one looks at the difference between the respective free energies, on the scale 1 / N. Indeed, the following result holds:

Define the random variable

[formula]

where [formula] are the same couplings which appear in the Hamiltonian ([\ref=H]). In the annealed region ([\ref=ann_reg]) N(β,α;J) converges in distribution, as N  →    ∞  , to a non-Gaussian random variable [formula] with characteristic function

[formula]

The variance of the limit random variable diverges when the boundary of the annealed region is approached.

Remark It is not difficult to check that, when the infinite connectivity limit is performed as in Section 4, the limit random variable becomes Gaussian (the terms of order higher than s2 disappear in the series) and one recovers the well known result of Ref. [\cite=alr] for the fluctuations of the SK free energy at zero external field and β' < 1.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=teoflutf]. The idea of the proof is to write down a linear differential equation for the characteristic function

[formula]

Of course, for α = 0 both the Viana-Bray and the tree model consist in an empty graph, so that

[formula]

As for the α derivative, the computation can be performed along the lines of the computation of ∂βAN(β,α) in Section 3, with the result

[formula]

Since | tanh (βJ)| <  tanh β < 1, one can expand the r.h.s. in an absolutely convergent Taylor series, using the formula

[formula]

and write

[formula]

Notice that, thanks to Theorem [\ref=teoaccopp],

[formula]

and the derivative in ([\ref=derivata]) can be bounded uniformly in N. Next, we can replace [formula] with [formula]. Indeed, thanks to Theorem [\ref=teoflutq] of the previous section,

[formula]

Therefore, denoting by φ the infinite volume limit of φN, one has

[formula]

from which the statement of the theorem follows after integration with respect to α. [formula]

Outlook and conclusions

In this paper, we have provided a complete picture of the high temperature or low connectivity phase of the Viana-Bray model, where annealing holds. Breaking of annealing is forecasted by the divergence of fluctuations of the free energy density (on the scale 1 / N) and of the two-replica overlap (on the scale [formula]). On the other hand, the fluctuations of the multi-overlap among [formula] configurations show no singularity when the boundary of the annealed region is approached.

The high temperature phase of the diluted p-spin model with p > 2 can be studied with the same techniques, but in this case one does not control the whole expected annealed region. On the other hand, the methods we presented here do not extend directly to the study of the replica symmetric region of the K-sat model, or of the diluted mean field model in presence of a magnetic field. In this case annealing does not hold, even at high temperature, and the random variable g which realizes the infimum of the replica symmetric functional is not trivial, as it is well known (see for instance [\cite=mz]). We plan to report on this subject in a future paper.

Appendix

Self-averaging of free energy and ground state energy densities

In this section we prove an upper bound, exponentially small in N and independent of β, for the fluctuations of the disorder dependent free energy density of the Viana-Bray model. Independence of β implies that the bound holds also for the fluctuations of the ground state energy density. Similar results have been known for a long time in the case of fully connected mean field spin glass models (for instance, see [\cite=talagcorso] and references therein) and for some random optimization problems [\cite=talaconc], [\cite=rhee].

For any value of β,α and N, one has

[formula]

Remarks The theorem can be immediately extended to the more general class of diluted spin glass models considered in [\cite=franz-leone]. In particular, for the diluted p-spin model [\cite=ricci] with p  ≥  3 the above result holds without any modification, while for the K-sat model one has to replace ([\ref=stima2]) by

[formula]

(The latter is a simple consequence of the fact that, for the K-sat, [formula] for any disorder realization, and that 1 / NE ln ZN  ≥   ln 2 - αβ, as it is easily verified from the definition of the model.) In particular, Eqs. ([\ref=ksat1])-([\ref=ksat2]) allow to recover the bound given in [\cite=broder] for the fluctuations of the minimal fraction of unsatisfied clauses in the K-sat problem.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=teoconcentr]. We sketch just the main steps in the proof, since it is very similar in spirit to that given for fully connected models in [\cite=talagcorso] [\cite=limterm2], the main difference being that the role of Gaussian integration by parts is replaced here by the properties ([\ref=prop1]), ([\ref=prop2]) of Poisson random variables.

Introduce the interpolating parameter [formula] and define, for [formula],

[formula]

where

[formula]

Here, all variables with upper index 1 are independent from those with index 2, and [formula] denotes the average

[formula]

The motivation for the introduction of φN(t) is the identity

[formula]

Since we want to bound the r.h.s. of ([\ref=identity]), we compute the t derivative of φN(t). After some straightforward computations, one finds

[formula]

and, thanks to the trivial bounds

[formula]

one has

[formula]

Putting together Eqs. ([\ref=putting]) and ([\ref=identity]), employing Tchebyshev's inequality and optimizing on s, one finally finds the statement of the theorem. [formula]
