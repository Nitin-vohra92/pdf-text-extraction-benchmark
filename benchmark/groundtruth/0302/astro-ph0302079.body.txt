Photometric properties of theoretical spectral libraries for GAIA photometry

Introduction

The GAIA Galactic survey will observe more than 1 billion of stars in our Galaxy, and will obtain photometry in 11 medium-band and 5 large-band filters with the challenging goal to determine the fundamental stellar parameters ([formula], log g,

[formula]

Grids of synthetic stellar spectra

The coverage in stellar parameters for each of the grids of models used in this comparative study is given in Table [\ref=tab:data]. The BaSeL 2.2 hybrid spectral library was constructed from empirical (= 0) and semi-empirical (  ≠  0) color-temperature relations (see Lejeune et al. 1997, 1998, for details), while the new BaSeL 3.1 models are based on purely empirical calibrations, defined for the metallicity range - 2.0  ≤  [Fe  /  H]  ≤  0.0 from a large collection of globular cluster UBVRIJHKL photometric data (see Westera et al. 2002 for details). Hence, the BaSeL 3.1 calibrations provide the only existing set of empirical metallicity-dependent [formula]-UBVRIJHKL transformations for - 2.0  ≤  [Fe  /  H]  ≤  0.0 over a large temperature range, from 2000 K to 50000 K, and are used as reference in this study. Synthetic spectra from the ATLAS 9 atmosphere models have been computed by Castelli et al. (1997) with no overshooting parameter.

Comparisons in the two-color diagrams

In Fig. [\ref=f:two_color_diag], model colors in the range 2500K  ≤   [formula] ≤  5500K, computed from the different grids of synthetic spectra given in Table [\ref=tab:data], are compared in the (B-V)/(V-I) color-color diagram for the same value of the surface gravity (log g = 1) with

=  - 0.6, - 0.3 and 0.0. From the figure, it is clear that large differences exist between the different grids, specially in the low temperature regime ([formula] <  4000K). Above 4000 K, the NMARCS models provide the best overall agreement with the BaSeL  3.1 empirical calibrations, both in B-V and V-I, in particular for the solar metallicity. In contrast, the PHOENIX models appear too blue in B-V, while they are in good agreement with the BaSeL  3.1 V-I colors. The B-V model colors from the ATLAS 9 grid are systematically redder below 4500 K. Below 4000 K, very large differences of several tenth of magnitude exist between all the model colors.

Similar comparisons (Lejeune et al., in prep.) for the dwarf models show that large deviations between the models and the BaSeL  3.1 empirical calibrations also exist, and are maximum below 4000 K. For the M dwarfs, model colors computed from the PHOENIX models provide the best agreement with the BaSeL  3.1 empirical calibrations.

Temperature-color calibrations

We also compared the theoretical temperature-color calibrations, [formula]-(U-B) and [formula]-(B-V), predicted by each grid of models in the range 3000K  ≤   [formula] ≤  6000K, with the temperature scales adopted in BaSeL  3.1 and the empirical calibrations of Alonso et al (1998, 1999) derived from the IRFM method. Our results (Lejeune et al., in prep) show that, for [formula] >  4000K, the theoretical scales for all the models agree well with the BaSeL 3.1 empirical relations for

[formula]

=   - 2.0.

Conclusions

UBVRI colors of the most widely used theoretical spectral libraries (ATLAS 9, PHOENIX, NMARCS, and BaSeL ) in the temperature range 7000 K - 3000 K have been compared with empirical calibrations available for - 2.0  ≤  [Fe  /  H]  ≤   + 0.5. We found that the ATLAS 9 model colors from Castelli et al. (1997) agree well or very well with the empirical color-temperature relations at all metallicities and over the range of effective temperatures between 6000 K and 3500 K. The most significant deviations are found for the [formula]-(U-B) relation at solar metallicity. Below 4000 K, important deviations are found for the UBV colors between both the PHOENIX NextGen and the NMARCS model predictions with respect to the BaSeL  3.1 empirical relations, although some uncertainties still exist in the empirical data at these low temperatures. In a general way, the deviations appear to be less important with the PHOENIX NextGen model colors for dwarfs, and with the NMARCS models for giants.

These differences have to be accounted for, or maybe reduced with some spectral corrections methods, in the selection of models in order to construct a spectral library well suitable to the definition of the GAIA photometric system.
