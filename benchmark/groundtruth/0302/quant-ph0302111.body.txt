Classical and quantum communication without a shared reference frame

Quantum physics allows for powerful new communication tasks that are not possible classically, such as secure communication [\cite=BB84] and entanglement-enhanced classical communication [\cite=Mac02]. In investigations of these and other communication tasks, considerable effort has been devoted to identifying the physical resources that are required for their implementation. It is generally presumed, at least implicitly, that a shared reference frame (SRF) between the communicating parties is such a resource, with the precise nature of the reference frame being dictated by the particular physical systems involved. For example, if the sender (Alice) and receiver (Bob) are communicating via spin-1/2 systems, it is generally presumed that they must share a reference frame for spatial orientation so that they may prepare and measure spin components relative to this frame. Despite the ubiquity of this presumption, we shall be asking whether it is necessitated by the laws of quantum physics.

This question is clearly of interest for pragmatic reasons. Establishing a SRF between two parties requires communication via a channel that is capable of transmitting some "physical" information (such as spatial orientation). Establishing a perfect SRF requires infinite communication (i.e., transmitting a system with an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, or an infinite number of systems with finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces [\cite=Per01] [\cite=Per01b].) Moreover, any finite (i.e., imperfect) SRF must be treated quantum mechanically and thus inevitably suffers disturbances during measurements, causing it to degrade. Finally, we note that shared prior entanglement, a valuable resource in distributed quantum information processing, can be consumed to establish SRFs [\cite=tez1] [\cite=Joz00].

In addition to these pragmatic issues, the presumed necessity of SRFs also touches upon a number of more foundational questions in quantum mechanics. For instance, it has been argued [\cite=dickson] that the physical nature of SRFs is the key issue in Bohr's reply to Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen. In this context, it is interesting that all currently proposed schemes for violating Bell inequalities presume the existence of a SRF - the results presented here indicate that this presumption is in fact unnecessary.

In this letter, we show that both classical and quantum communication can be achieved without first establishing a SRF by using entangled states of multiple qubits. We explicitly describe a scheme that employs two qubits to communicate a single classical bit of information, and a scheme that uses four qubits to transmit an encoded "logical" qubit. In both schemes, the communication is achieved with perfect fidelity. (Note that, in contrast, any scheme that attempts to establish a SRF first, using a finite amount of communication, will necessarily be subject to errors.) We present the optimal schemes for communicating classical and quantum information with perfect fidelity given N transmitted qubits, and we prove that communication of one classical bit per transmitted qubit or one logical qubit per transmitted qubit can be achieved asymptotically. As an explicit example of the practicality of our scheme for classical communication without a SRF, we propose a feasible experiment using existing optical technology to communicate one classical bit of information per entangled photon pair.

Our communication scenario consists of two parties that have access to a quantum channel but do not possess a SRF. For simplicity, we consider a noiseless channel that transmits qubits (our results can be extended to noisy channels or higher-dimensional systems). Such a channel defines an isomorphism between Alice's and Bob's local experimental operations. Specifically, representing Alice's experimental operations using one qubit Hilbert space and Bob's using another, the isomorphism is given by a unitary map R(Ω), Ω∈ SU(2) between them. We define the lack of a SRF as a lack of any knowledge of this isomorphism; i.e., a lack of any knowledge of Ω. If Alice prepares a qubit in the state ρ and transmits it to Bob, he represents the state of this received qubit as a mixed density operator

[formula]

obtained by averaging over all possible isomorphisms, i.e., all unitary maps R(Ω), Ω∈ SU(2). (Here, dΩ is the SU(2)-invariant measure.) Thus, without a SRF, Alice cannot communicate any information to Bob using only a single qubit.

However, if Alice chooses to send more than one qubit to Bob, some information can be transmitted because the relative state of the qubits carries information regardless of the existence of a SRF. For instance, if Alice prepares two qubits in the state ρ, Bob describes this same pair of qubits by the state that results by application of the superoperator

[formula]

Note that this two-qubit superoperator does not average over independent transformations for each qubit; instead, it averages over a single qubit transformation Ω∈ SU(2) applied identically to both qubits.

Consider the following example where Alice encodes a single classical bit b by transmiting two qubits: for b = 0, Alice sends parallel spins (|0〉1|0〉2), and for b = 1 she sends anti-parallel spins (|0〉1|1〉2). Using his optimal measurement [\cite=Hel76], Bob can correctly estimate b with probability 3 / 4. Thus, with this scheme, some information about Alice's bit is transmitted without a SRF, but some is lost.

However, Alice need not send product states as in the above example. As with the problem of establishing a shared direction [\cite=Per01] or Cartesian frame [\cite=Per01b], entanglement between qubits provides an advantage. To determine which (possibly entangled) states may allow for optimal communication, we note that the tensor representation of SU(2) on two qubits decomposes into a direct sum of a j = 0 irreducible representation (irrep) carried by the antisymmetric state [formula] and a j = 1 irrep carried by the symmetric states, and that the tensor representation of SU(2) on this direct sum does not mix these irreps. Thus, the antisymmetric state is invariant under the action of E2, E2(|Ψ-〉〈Ψ-|)  =  |Ψ-〉〈Ψ-|, and any density operator with support on the symmetric subspace is mapped by E2 to the completely mixed state [formula] over the symmetric subspace. Thus, we propose the following communication protocol. Alice sends Bob the antisymmetric state |Ψ-〉 to communicate b = 0 and any state in the symmetric subspace for b = 1. Bob then performs a projective measurement onto the antisymmetric and symmetric subspaces and will recover b with certainty. Thus, using this protocol, Alice can communicate one classical bit to Bob for every two qubits sent.

The efficiency of the scheme can be increased by entangling more qubits. Consider the transmission of N qubits; the superoperator EN that describes the lack of a SRF acting on a general density operator ρ of N qubits is given by

[formula]

This "collective" tensor representation of SU(2) on N j = 1 / 2 systems (i.e., R(Ω)∈ SU(2) acting identically on all qubits) can again be decomposed into a direct sum of SU(2) irreps, with angular momentum quantum number j ranging from 0 or 1 / 2 to N / 2. In general, there will be multiple irreps for a given value of j. For simplicity, we assume that N is even. In this case, we can express the resulting direct sum as

[formula]

where SU(2)j denotes the irrep of SU(2) with angular momentum quantum number j, and c(N)j denotes the number of times that the irrep SU(2)j appears in the direct sum (i.e., the multiplicity of the irrep).

We note that the different irreps of the same j value (the multiplicities) are defined by the ordering of the coupling, because there are in general many ways to couple N particles to total j. Thus, to agree on the definitions of the multiple irreps for a given j, Alice and Bob must agree on a choice of ordering of the coupling. This agreement on coupling does not require a SRF, but does require that Alice and Bob agree on a labeling [formula] of each qubit.

We can now state and prove the result for classical communication.

Proposition: The maximum number of classical messages that can be perfectly transmitted without a SRF is equal to the number C(N) of SU(2) irreps in the direct sum decomposition of the tensor representation of SU(2) on N qubits.

Proof: We employ the following property of EN: for any state |ψj,r〉 in the carrier space [formula] of the irrep labelled by j,r (where r is a label for the multiplicity), the state [formula] is the completely mixed state over that irrep. To transmit C(N) classical messages, it is sufficient for Alice to encode these messages using C(N) distinct states, one chosen from each irrep. Bob can perform a measurement associated with the projector-valued measure [formula] to distinguish the subspaces corresponding to the direct sum decomposition. For Alice to send an additional message, she must be able to prepare a state |ψ'〉 that Bob can distinguish from the other states with certainty. Thus, [formula] must be orthogonal to ρj,r for all j,r. There does not exist such a ρ' because the supports of the ρj,r span the entire Hilbert space. [formula]

To determine C(N), we note that the multiplicity c(N)j of each irrep in the direct sum decomposition is determined by the dimension of the corresponding representation of the symmetric group (the group of permutations of the N systems) [\cite=Ful91]. Thus, c(N)j can be calculated using Young tableaux: it is the number of possible Young tableaux for a Young diagram consisting of two rows, the first row consisting of N / 2  +  j columns and the second consisting of N / 2 - j columns. Using the hook lengths to calculate the number of Young tableaux yields

[formula]

The total number of SU(2) irreps that appear in the direct sum decomposition for N qubits is

[formula]

The number of classical bits that can be transmitted per qubit using the above scheme is N- 1 log 2C(N), which tends asymptotically to 1 - (2N)- 1 log 2N. Thus, in the large N limit, one classical bit can be transmitted for every qubit sent. Remarkably, this rate is equivalent to what can be accomplished if Alice and Bob do possess a SRF.

In general, the states to be transmitted in the optimal scheme for N qubits are highly entangled. (They include, for example, singlet states of N qubits.) Such multipartite entangled states are difficult to prepare in practice. However, as we now show, for the case N = 2 the required entanglement is easily achieved using quantum optics, in particular using the polarization degree of freedom of a photon.

When using an optical fibre for transmitting polarized photons, Bob typically has no knowledge of the relationship between Alice's polarization axes and his own. Such an optical fibre is an instance of a quantum channel without a SRF. To demonstrate communication of a single classical bit using such a channel, we can make use of maximally-entangled photon pairs (Bell states) produced using parametric downconversion (PDC) [\cite=Kwi95]. For example, by selecting two spatial modes (each with two polarization states, |H〉 and |V〉) from the PDC output, one can prepare the antisymmetric Bell state [formula]. By performing a [formula] polarization rotation on one of the spatial modes, Alice can also prepare the symmetric Bell state [formula]. Thus, in our proposed experiment, Alice prepares the antisymmetric state |Ψ-〉12 to encode the classical bit b = 0, and prepares |Φ-〉12 for b = 1.

Alice then transmits these photons to Bob, who performs a projective measurement onto the antisymmetric and symmetric subspaces of the two spatial modes in order to retrieve the classical bit b. To perform this measurement, Bob employs a linear optics Bell state analyzer. An ideal Bell state analyzer that distinguishes all four Bell states is impossible using only linear optics and photodetectors [\cite=Lut99]; however, such a complete measurement is not required in this example. Using linear optics, one can distinguish the antisymmetric state from the symmetric ones [\cite=Wei94]. Such a measurement scheme employs a 50/50 beam splitter that mixes the two spatial modes, followed by photodetection at each output mode. A coincidence detection (each photodetector detects one photon) indicates the antisymmetric state, whereas the detection of two photons at a single photodetector indicates a symmetric state. Thus, using existing quantum optics technology, it is possible to communicate classical bits using entangled photon pairs without a SRF.

We now turn to the problem of quantum communication in the absence of a SRF. It is clear from Eq. ([\ref=eq:SingleQubitSuperop]) that a single transmitted qubit can convey no quantum information. However, in analogy to our classical communication results, multiple transmitted qubits do allow for this possibility. Although quantum information can only be communicated with imperfect fidelity using two transmitted qubits, we now demonstrate that perfect fidelity can be achieved by using more than two qubits.

The key insight is that, because EN describes a collective decoherence mechanism, we can appeal to the techniques of decoherence free subspaces (DFSs) [\cite=Zan97]. For N (even) transmitted qubits, we observe that the superoperator EN leaves all j = 0 states in the direct sum decomposition invariant. Thus, the j = 0 states span a DFS, denoted [formula]. The number of j = 0 states is given by the multiplicity [formula].

For N = 2, there is only one j = 0 state: the Bell state |Ψ-〉. Since no quantum information can be encoded in a one-dimensional subspace, two physical qubits are insufficient for the purpose of transmitting quantum information with perfect fidelity. For N = 4, on the other hand, there are two distinct j = 0 states, specifically,

[formula]

where {|0〉,|1〉} is any orthogonal basis for the single qubit Hilbert space. The superoperator EN preserves the two-dimensional subspace spanned by these states, i.e., this subspace is a DFS.

Thus four physical qubits can encode a single logical qubit. Single-qubit operations on this logical qubit are an encoded representation of SU(2) that commutes with the superoperator EN. The encoded generators are given by Hermitian exchange operations (i.e., two-qubit permutations), which clearly do not require a SRF; for details of the encoded SU(2) group as well as two-logical-qubit coupling operations, see [\cite=Zan97] [\cite=Kni00].

Noiseless subsystems [\cite=Kni00] can be used to maximize the amount of encoded quantum information protected from the decohering superoperator EN. For example, it is possible to encode one logical qubit into only three physical qubits. For a given number N of physical qubits, the maximal subsystem is given by the irrep j max with the greatest multiplicity c(N)j. Asymptotically, this irrep is found to be [formula], and the number N- 1 log 2c(N)j max of logical qubits encoded per physical qubit in N physical qubits behaves as 1  -  N- 1 log 2N, approaching unity for large N. This remarkable result proves that quantum communication without a SRF is asymptotically as efficient as quantum communication with a SRF, and is the communication analog of "asymptotic universality" [\cite=Kni00].

These results imply that Alice and Bob can share entangled states in the absence of a reference frame. For instance, Alice can prepare two quadruplets of physical qubits in the state [formula], and send one quadruplet to Bob. Since Alice and Bob can perform any measurement in their respective logical qubit Hilbert spaces, they can violate Bell inequalities despite having no SRF. It also follows that such entangled states can be used for quantum teleportation, which implies that the latter does not rely upon the existence of a SRF either, contrary to the claims of [\cite=Enk01].

Another situation of interest is if Alice and Bob share a partial reference frame, for instance, if they share only a single direction in space rather than a full Cartesian frame. In this case, the superoperator describing a partial SRF corresponds to what the DFS community calls a collective dephasing operation [\cite=Dua98]. Here, Alice and Bob can obviously transmit a classical bit using a single qubit. To communicate a single logical qubit, it suffices to transmit two physical qubits, and asymptotically, the ratio of logical qubits to transmitted qubits is 1 - (2N)- 1 log 2N.

We note that the encoding used in our schemes also protects against channel noise that affects all qubits identically [\cite=Zan97]. If all transmitted qubits are sent close together in space and time, such a description will be appropriate. It follows, in particular, that noise in the evolution of transmitted qubits, which is problematic for the quantum clock synchronization protocol of [\cite=Joz00], will generally not cause errors in our communication schemes. On the other hand, a noisy channel that affects the individual transmitted qubits differently or that causes a loss of information about the ordering of the qubits will be problematic. However, concatenated encodings and quantum error correction can be used to accommodate this noise.

There remain many interesting questions about the role of reference frames in quantum theory. For instance, it appears that the availability of a reference frame for some degree of freedom determines whether or not it is appropriate to assume a superselection rule for the complementary variable (the status of such rules has been the subject of some controversy [\cite=Aha67]). Another problem of interest is to determine how these results generalize to relativistic quantum mechanics, wherein reference frames have particular significance.

In conclusion, we have shown how to perform both classical and quantum communication without a SRF, thereby proving that a SRF is not a necessary requirement for communication or distributed quantum information processing. Also, we have shown that asymptotically this communication can be performed as efficiently as if a SRF was available. We have proposed an experiment to demonstrate this principle using entangled photons.
