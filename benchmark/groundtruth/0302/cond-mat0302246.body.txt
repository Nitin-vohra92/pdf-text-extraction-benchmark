Measurement of positive and negative scattering lengths in a Fermi gas of atoms

in

The possibility of superfluidity in an atomic Fermi gas has been studied theoretically[\cite=Stoof] [\cite=Holland] [\cite=Timmermans] [\cite=Kokkelmans] [\cite=Hofstetter]. Analogous to superconductivity in metals and superfluidity in liquid 3He, this fermionic superfluid phase requires effectively attractive interactions in the gas. In addition, these interactions need to be relatively strong if the phase transition is to occur at a temperature Tc that can be realized with current experimental techniques. Magnetic-field tunable Feshbach scattering resonances provide a unique tool that could create these conditions in an ultracold atomic Fermi gas. These resonances arise when the collision energy of two free atoms coincides with that of a quasi-bound molecular state[\cite=Stwalley76] [\cite=Ties92]. By varying the strength of the external magnetic field the experimenter can tune relative energies through the Zeeman effect and thus control the strength of the interactions as well as whether they are effectively repulsive or attractive.

A novel superfluid phase, termed "resonance superfluidity," is predicted for a Fermi gas near a Feshbach resonance peak [\cite=Holland] [\cite=Timmermans]. Unique properties of this phase include a Tc that is a relatively large fraction of the Fermi temperature TF. With predicted Tc / TF as high as 0.5, resonance superfluidity may have more in common with exotic high-Tc superconductors than with ordinary superfluidity. In fact, resonance superfluidity would exist in a crossover regime between the physics of Bose-Einstein condensation, which occurs for composite bosons made up of tightly bound fermions, and BCS-type superconductivity, which occurs for pairs of fermions that are loosely correlated in momentum space (Cooper pairs). The experimental investigation of resonance superfluidity, and its dependence on magnetic-field detuning from the Feshbach resonance, could provide new insight into these two types of quantum fluids.

Interactions in ultracold gases arise predominantly from binary s-wave collisions whose strength can be characterized by a single parameter, the s-wave scattering length a. Across a Feshbach resonance a can in principle be varied from -    ∞   to +    ∞  , where a < 0 (a > 0) corresponds to effectively attractive (repulsive) interactions. In atomic Fermi gases Feshbach resonances have been seen in their enhancement of elastic[\cite=Loftus] [\cite=Regal] [\cite=O'Hara] and inelastic[\cite=Regal] [\cite=O'Hara] [\cite=Jochim] [\cite=Dieckmann] collision rates. However collision cross sections depend on a2 and are not sensitive to whether the interactions are attractive or repulsive. The mean-field energy, on the other hand, is a quantum mechanical, many-body effect that is proportional to na, where n is the number density. For Bose-Einstein condensates with repulsive interactions the mean-field energy and therefore a can be determined from the size of the trapped condensate[\cite=Inouye] [\cite=Cornish], while attractive interactions cause large condensates to become mechanically unstable[\cite=Gerton] [\cite=Roberts2]. For an atomic Fermi gas the mean-field interaction energy has a much smaller impact on the thermodynamics. Fermionic atoms obey the Pauli exclusion principle and occupy higher energy states of the external trapping potential. Correspondingly a trapped Fermi gas has a lower density and larger kinetic energy. The mean-field energy thus does not have an observable effect on the cloud size or momentum distribution[\cite=demarco2001]. In this work we introduce a novel rf spectroscopic technique that measures the mean-field energy directly. With this technique we have measured both positive and negative scattering lengths in a Fermi gas of atoms that is tuned near the peak of a Feshbach resonance.

Experimental techniques The experiments reported here (see Fig. [\ref=flowchart]) employ previously developed techniques for cooling and spin state manipulation of 40K[\cite=Loftus] [\cite=DeMarco1]. Because of the quantum statistics of fermions a mixture of two components, for example atoms in different internal spin states, is required to have s-wave interactions in the ultracold gas[\cite=DeMarco3]. With a total atomic spin f=9/2 in its lowest hyperfine ground state,40K has ten available Zeeman spin-states |f,mf〉. Atoms in a 90/10 mixture of the mf=9/2 and mf=7/2 states are held in a magnetic trap and cooled by forced evaporation [\cite=DeMarco1]. The gas is then loaded into a far-off resonance optical dipole trap where rf transitions are used to obtain the desired spin composition [\cite=Loftus]. First, the gas is completely transferred to the mf=-9/2 and mf=-7/2 states using adiabatic rapid passage. We apply a 15 ms rf frequency sweep across all ten spin states at a field of 20 G. We then move to a higher field, 240 G, where the Zeeman transitions are no longer degenerate and apply an rf π / 2 pulse on the mf=-9/2 to mf=-7/2 transition. After the coherence is lost (which takes less than 100 ms) we are left with a mixture of two components, whose relative population can be controlled with the rf pulse duration.

With this spin mixture we further evaporatively cool the gas by lowering the optical trap depth. The optical power is ramped from 900 mW to 8 mW in 2.9 seconds. During this evaporation, the radial frequency of the optical trap νr varies from 2800 to 270 Hz and the trap aspect ratio λ  =  νz  /  νr remains constant at 0.016 [\cite=freqz]. Starting with 2x107 atoms at [formula] our evaporation reaches T / TF = 0.1 with 105 atoms remaining. To measure the quantum degeneracy of the evaporatively cooled gas we take resonant absorption images of the cloud after expansion from the optical trap. These images reflect the momentum distribution of the ultracold gas and are surface fit to a Thomas-Fermi profile[\cite=rokshar]. In the fits the fugacity z is left as a free parameter that measures the amount of distortion from a Gaussian shape. The value of z obtained from the fit can then be compared to T / TF obtained from the measured temperature T and calculated Fermi temperature TF = hνr(6λN9)1 / 3, where N9 is the total number of mf=-9/2 atoms and h is Planck's constant. The results of this analysis, shown in Fig. [\ref=fugacity], verify that the gas is cooled well into the quantum degenerate regime with T / TF reaching as low as 0.1.

Controlling interactions To control the interactions in the two-component Fermi gas we access a magnetic-field Feshbach resonance in the collisions between atoms in the |9 / 2, - 9 / 2〉 and |9 / 2, - 5 / 2〉 spin states[\cite=newresnote]. At magnetic fields B near the resonance peak, the mean-field energy in the Fermi gas was measured using rf spectroscopy (see Fig. [\ref=expt]a). First, optically trapped atoms were evaporatively cooled in a 72/28 mixture of the mf=-9/2 and mf=-7/2 spin states. After the evaporation the optical trap was recompressed to either νr = 1390 Hz or νr=2770 Hz. In addition the magnetic field was ramped to the desired value near the resonance. We then quickly turned on the resonant interaction by transferring atoms from the mf=-7/2 state to the mf=-5/2 state with a 73 μs rf π-pulse. The fraction of mf=-7/2 atoms remaining after the pulse was measured as a function of the rf frequency.

The relative number of mf=-7/2 atoms was obtained from a resonant absorption image of the gas taken after 1 ms of expansion from the optical trap. Atoms in the mf=-7/2 state were probed selectively by leaving the magnetic field high and taking advantage of nonlinear Zeeman shifts. Sample rf absorption spectra, taken in the νr = 1390 Hz trap, are shown in Fig. [\ref=expt]b. At magnetic fields well away from the Feshbach resonance we are able to transfer all of the mf=-7/2 atoms to the mf=-5/2 state and the rf lineshape has a width limited by the pulse duration. The rf frequency for maximum transfer depends predictably on the current in the magnetic field coils and provides a calibration of B. We estimate that the values of B reported here have a systematic uncertainty of ±  0.05 gauss. At the Feshbach resonance we observe two changes to the rf spectra. First, the frequency for maximum transfer is shifted relative to the expected value from the magnetic field calibration. Second, the maximum transfer is reduced and the measured lineshape is wider.

Both of these effects arise from the mean-field energy due to strong interactions between |9 / 2, - 9 / 2〉 and |9 / 2, - 5 / 2〉 atoms at the Feshbach resonance. The mean-field energy produces a density-dependent frequency shift given by

[formula]

where m is the atom mass, π, n9 is the number density of atoms in the mf =  - 9 / 2 state, and a59 (a79) is the scattering length for collisions between atoms in the mf=-9/2 and mf=-5/2 (mf=-7/2) states. Here we have ignored a non-resonant interaction term proportional to the population difference between the mf=-7/2 and mf=-5/2 states; this term equals 0 for a perfect π-pulse. For our spatially inhomogeneous trapped gas, the density dependence broadens the lineshape and lowers the maximum transfer. This effect on both sides of the Feshbach resonance peak. In contrast, the frequency shift for maximum transfer reflects the scattering length and changes sign across the resonance.

We have measured the mean-field shift Δν as a function of B near the Feshbach resonance peak. The rf frequency for maximum transfer was obtained from Lorentzian fits to spectra like those shown in Fig. [\ref=expt]b. The expected resonance frequency was then subtracted to yield Δν. The scattering length a59 was obtained using Eqn.1 with n9 = 0.5np and a79 = 174ao where ao is the Bohr radius[\cite=Loftus]. The peak density of the trapped mf=-9/2 gas np was obtained from Gaussian fits to absorption images. The numerical factor 0.5 multiplying np was determined by modelling the transfer with a pulse-width limited Lorentzian integrated over a Gaussian density profile in the two radial directions.

The measured scattering length as a function of B is shown in Fig. [\ref=meanfield]. This plot, which combines data taken for two different trap strengths and gas densities, shows that we are able to realize both large positive and large negative values of a59 near the Feshbach resonance peak. The solid line in Fig. [\ref=meanfield] shows a fit to the expected form for a Feshbach resonance [formula] [\cite=Kokkelmans]. Data within [formula] gauss of the peak were excluded from the fit. With abg = 174ao we find that the Feshbach resonance peak occurs at 224.21±  0.05 G and has a width w of [formula] G.

When B is tuned very close to the Feshbach resonance peak we expect the measured a59 to have a maximum value of approximately 1 / kF due to the unitarity limit. Here F is the Fermi momentum for the mf=-9/2 gas. This saturation can be seen in the data shown in Fig. [\ref=meanfield]. Two points that were taken within [formula] gauss of the Feshbach resonance peak, one on either side of the resonance, clearly lie below the fit curve. Observation of this saturation demonstrates that we can access the strongly interacting regime with a59kF is greater than 1. It is in this regime that resonance superfluidity is predicted to occur. Using the fit discussed above, we find that the unitarity-limited point on the attractive interaction side of the resonance (higher B) corresponds to a gas that actually has [formula].

Anisotropic expansion Having obtained a precise map of a59 versus B we investigated the expansion of the Fermi gas near the Feshbach resonance. Anisotropic expansion has been put forth as a possible signature of superfluidity[\cite=Menotti] and has recently been observed in a 6Li Fermi gas[\cite=O'Hara2]. However, a normal gas in the hydrodynamic regime, where the collision rate is large compared to the trap oscillator frequencies, is expected to exhibit the same anisotropy in expansion[\cite=Menotti] [\cite=Kagan]. In this case, collisions during the expansion transfer kinetic energy from the elongated axial cloud dimension into the radial direction. A large magnitude scattering length, such as is required for resonance superfluidity, enhances the collision rate in the gas and could cause the normal gas to approach the hydrodynamic regime.

We have utilized our ability to tune a59 with the magnetic-field Feshbach resonance to investigate these effects. After evaporatively cooling atoms in a 45/55 mixture of the mf=-9/2 and mf=-7/2 spin states, the optical trap power was increased to yield a trap characterized by νr = 1230 Hz. In addition, the magnetic field was ramped to the desired value near the resonance. We then transferred atoms from the mf=-7/2 state to the mf=-5/2 state with a 29 μs rf π-pulse[\cite=pulse]. Expansion was initiated by turning off the optical trapping beam with an acousto-optic modulator 0.3 ms after the rf pulse. The magnetic field remained high for 5 ms of expansion and a resonant absorption image was taken after a total expansion time of 20 ms.

We find that the ratio of the axial and transverse widths of the expanded cloud, σz/σy, decreases at the peak of the Feshbach resonance (Fig. [\ref=anisotropy]). This effect depends on having strong interactions during the expansion; we do not see any change in σz/σy if the magnetic field, and consequently the resonant interactions, is switched off at the same time as the optical trap. The anisotropic expansion is basically symmetric about the peak of the resonance and thus is not sensitive to the sign of the interactions (repulsive or attractive). Therefore the anisotropic expansion observed here is not a signature of superfluidity but rather a collisional effect.

To see if hydrodynamic expansion of the normal gas is expected we can calculate the elastic collision rate Γ in the gas[\cite=Holl01]. For this calculation T and N are obtained from Thomas-Fermi fits to absorption images of clouds away from the Feshbach resonance where we find that T / TF = 0.34. Using an elastic collision cross section given by σ = 4πa259 and |a59| = 2000 (as was measured near the resonance peak), we find Γ=46 kHz. With Γ  /  νr = 37 and Γ  /  νz = 2400 it is not surprising that we observe anisotropic expansion. For a gas that was fully hydrodynamic, with Γ  ≫  νr,νz, we would expect our measured aspect ratio to reach 0.4[\cite=Menotti] [\cite=Kagan].

Future prospects In conclusion, we have measured the mean-field energy in a Fermi gas of atoms for both strong attractive and strong repulsive interactions. The rf spectroscopy technique demonstrated here allows one to measure both the sign and strength of the interactions and thus take full advantage of the control over interactions afforded by a magnetic-field Feshbach resonance. In addition to the ability to create strong attractive interactions in the gas, we have demonstrated two other ingredients that are key to the goal of realizing Cooper pairing in a gas of atoms. We are able to cool the optically trapped gas to [formula], and precisely control the spin composition. In addition the rf spectroscopy demonstrated here could provide a method for detecting "resonance superfluidity" by measuring the binding energy of Cooper pairs[\cite=Petrosyan] [\cite=Torma] [\cite=Bruun]. Finally, we have observed anisotropic expansion of the strongly interacting Fermi gas, and find that this is a collisional effect that occurs for both attractive and repulsive interactions.
