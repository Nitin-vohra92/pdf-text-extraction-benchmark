Semiclassical approaches to controlling chemical reaction dynamics

Introduction

Controlling molecular dynamics is one of the intriguing targets in chemical physics. Since the works of Brumer and Shapiro, Tannor and Rice, and others, laser control of molecular dynamics has been developed relatively well for simple molecular processes [\cite=RZ00]. Theoretically, in order to obtain an optimal field producing a desired product, optimal control theory (OCT) is one of the most natural and flexible vehicles [\cite=RZ00]. It assumes a certain functional which should be maximized, from which one can derive equations of motion which in turn determines the optimal field. The equations including Schrödinger equation must be solved iteratively in general, hence its numerical cost becomes huge for large molecules. Although there exist some calculations for reduced dimensionality models of large molecules, it can be very difficult to control even a triatomic molecule quantum mechanically within the present state of art. Some strategies to circumvent this difficulty are strongly desired.

Our basic strategy is as follows: Laser-driven chemical reactions are considered to consist of two processes. One is the wavepacket propagation on an adiabatic potential energy surface (PES), and the other is the electronic transition between PES's. Because the latter process is mathematically equivalent to nonadiabatic transitions between Floquet (dressed) states, we can control such a process using the semiclassical Zhu-Nakamura theory for nonadiabatic transitions [\cite=ZTN01]. (It has been shown in Refs. [\cite=ZTN01] [\cite=NTN00] [\cite=NTN02] that this strategy is very successful.) In Sec. [\ref=sec:HI], we shall show another example of our strategy. A new thing here is that we treat a real diatomic molecule, HI, with its real PES information. We shall use the idea of complete reflection to control HI photodissociation to two different channels. A complication arises due to existence of three electronically excited states [\cite=FTN02].

For controlling the wavepacket dynamics on a PES, on the other hand, we need to employ a general optimization procedure like OCT. There have been many applications of OCT in the literature; however, such works are often limited to rather small systems with less than three degrees of freedom. This is because the conventional methods of wavepacket propagation using grids are limited to rather small systems. Semiclassical wavepacket propagation methods are believed to overcome this kind of difficulty with use of classical trajectories. Hence it is very natural to examine the possibility of combining the semiclassical wavepacket propagation methods with OCT. In Sec. [\ref=sec:OCT], we employ one of semiclassical wavepacket propagation methods, the initial value representation (IVR) method using the Herman-Kluk propagator [\cite=MB00], and incorporate it into OCT. It is known that the IVR method can approximately reproduce the full quantum results for many molecular systems, and its computational scalability is much less than that of the corresponding quantum calculations for large molecules. In addition, we can understand the "physical aspects" of the optimal field because the IVR method represents the result as a sum of the quantities calculated from classical trajectories.

The effectiveness of the IVR method has been mainly tested for single PES systems, i.e., systems without nonadiabatic transitions. (For exceptions, see Ref. [\cite=SM97].) On the other hand, we have the semiclassical Zhu-Nakamura theory of nonadiabatic transition [\cite=ZTN01], and it is shown that it can be used to control even wavepacket excitation between PES's under some conditions [\cite=NTN02]. In Sec. [\ref=sec:semi], we examine the possibility to combine this kind of semiclassical theory of nonadiabatic transitions with the semiclassical wavepacket propagation method.

Controlling a molecule by complete reflection: Application to HI photodissociation

We shall apply the strategy using complete reflection [\cite=NTN00] to HI photodissociation. The ab initio potential energy curve (PEC) information is reproduced in Fig. 2 of [\cite=FTN02]. There are three electronically excited states, and their transition dipole moments depend on the internuclear distance significantly.

When applying a stationary laser field, we can consider this system as a curve-crossing system: one curve from the electronically ground state crosses with the other three curves from the electronically excited states. At crossings nonadiabatic transitions occur and such a phenomenon can be accurately treated by the semiclassical ZN formula. If the energy of a vibrational state satisfies a resonant-like condition, then the phenomenon, complete reflection, occurs: such a wavepacket cannot escape from the upper adiabatic PEC to the lower adiabatic PEC. (The lifetime is infinite.) This strategy can be used to control photodissociation and some model calculations were done in [\cite=NTN00].

To control HI photodissociation, we need to control three crossings at the same time. Of course, this is mathematically impossible because the complete reflection occurs at a certain energy point, but it might work in practice at some time interval. As shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:flux_time](a), at a certain energy (ω≃3.58 eV) and up to a certain time interval (14 ps), the two fluxes (J2(t),J4(t)) corresponding to two electronically excited PEC's connected to H+I channel nearly equal zero because this energy satisfies the complete reflection condition for both states to a good extent. In this case, we have to prepare the vibrationally excited state with v = 4 (v = 5 is better from experimental points of view [\cite=Kawasaki], but the qualitative result is the same). In addition, the contribution from v = 0 component, which might remain as a major component even after infrared excitation of the vibrational state, is very small as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:flux_time](b). This means that the H+I* photodissociation can be nearly completely achieved by using the vibrational state with v = 4 and the stationary laser field with ω≃3.58 eV. (In contrast, it is easy to achieve H+I photodissociation because only single excited PEC is asymptotically connected to H+I* which should be blocked.)

We have not included the effect of rotation and temperature, which degrade the quality of control, but the actual experimental condition is expected to be much similar to our calculation [\cite=Kawasaki].

Semiclassical implementation of optimal control theory

In the previous section, we have shown that the electronic transition can be controlled with the help of the semiclassical ZN formula. As mentioned in the introduction, however, laser-driven chemical reactions consist of two processes, and we need to control not only electronic transitions but also wavepacket propagation. There seems to be no simple semiclassical methods to deal with the latter, so we examine the possibility to combine the optimal control theory (OCT) with a semiclassical wavepacket propagation method with the Herman-Kluk propagator [\cite=MB00]. As an OCT procedure, we take the Zhu-Botina-Rabitz method [\cite=ZBR98], and substitute the semiclassical propagator into the control scheme. The numerical result for HD+ molecule is shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:OCT]: The control here is to shift the vibrational ground state to 1 a.u. away from the equilibrium position, the target time T is 100 fs, and the so called penalty factor α is 0.01.

As can be seen, the semiclassical result quantitatively agrees with the quantum result. Unfortunately, however, this straightforward semiclassical calculation needs more computational time compared with the corresponding quantum calculation! This is because the optimal field expressed as

[formula]

requires O(N2) calculations where N is the number of the trajectories. Here |φ(t)〉 and |χ(t)〉 are semiclassically calculated wavefunctions with computational cost O(N); so 〈φ(t)|χ(t)〉 and 〈χ(t)|μ|φ(t)〉 amount to such an order of calculation in general. (μ is the transition dipole moment.) One might expect that we can reduce the cost by decreasing the width of the Gaussian wavepacket in the HK propagator; but it turns out that the overall efficiency cannot be improved. The same difficulty appears when one semiclassically calculates general correlation functions as analyzed by Miller [\cite=Miller01].

We are now planning to use a sort of genetic algorithm [\cite=JR92] to circumvent this difficulty since the optimal fields in the genetic algorithm procedure are represented as "genes", and there is no such a scaling problem. (The initially guessed field can be obtained from the concept of nonadiabatic transition between vibrational states.)

Semiclassical IVR method for nonadiabatic transitions

The semiclassical methods mentioned above separately treat the processes of adiabatic propagation on a single adiabatic PES and those of electronic transition. This means that the whole process should be divided into three steps: (i) propagation on an initial PES, (ii) nonadiabatic transition, and (iii) propagation on a final PES. The optimal field should be designed so that no unnecessary interference occurs between the steps. In order to overcome such a restriction and to use the unique pulse to control the process, semiclassical IVR methods for nonadiabatic transitions should be constructed. One of the purposes of this work is to develop such a method which generalizes the ordinary Herman-Kluk propagator for the case of several electronic states. For other studies in this direction, see [\cite=SM97].

The research is still under way and preliminary results for a 1D case are presented. The model system employed is H+2 molecule composed of 1sσg and 2pσu states. An initial wavefunction is assumed to be a Gaussian of width 0.5 a.u. with center at 5 a.u. on the 1sσg state. The external field is assumed to be a linearly polarized femtosecond pulse with the Gaussian profile of FWHM = 10 fs. The total duration of wavepacket propagation is 20 fs. The wavelength of the femtosecond pulse is 515 nm and the crossing point of the dressed electronic states is located at 4 a.u. The results for the wavepacket propagation are shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:semi].

Outlook

We have advocated the use of semiclassical methods for control problems in view of its general capability to treat multidimensional systems with less computational cost. If the dimensionality of the system is high, the effects of "chaos" might also affect the quality of control. We have shown that a chaotic system called a kicked rotor can be controlled by using the Zhu-Botina-Rabitz method even when the system becomes strongly chaotic in the classical limit [\cite=TFM03]. It should be confirmed whether this is generic or not for multidimensional systems. For much larger systems, even semiclassical calculations themselves are formidable, and in such a situation we need to use some kind of mixed quantum-classical methods. They are very practical ways to treat multidimensional phenomena like vibrational relaxation in solvents [\cite=Okazaki], so it is interesting to control such phenomena with use of mixed quantum-classical methods.
