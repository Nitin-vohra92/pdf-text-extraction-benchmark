Abstract

A technique to sum up the regular corrections appearing under the analytic continuation from the spacelike momentum region to the timelike one is proposed. A perturbative part of the inclusive semileptonic decay width of the τ-lepton in analyzed in detail.

At present the theory of electroweak interactions is tested with truly great accuracy due to creation of the modern experimental machines [\cite=1] and to the happy possibility to fulfill the reliable theoretical calculations within the perturbative framework in the gauge coupling constants which are small [\cite=2]. The standard model as a whole however can not be checked with the same impressive accuracy because of uncertainties introduced by the strong interactions into the theoretical predictions at low energies.

Inclusive process τ  →  ν + hadrons is one of the most convenient channels to explore strong interactions in the low energy region and, in particular, to determine the numerical value of the strong coupling constant [formula]. The reason consists in two crucial observations: first, the problems of describing the final hadronic states disappear while calculating the full width of the decay and, second, the nonperturbative corrections to the decay rate are small due to some specific features of the process kinematics [\cite=3] [\cite=4].

In the present note we estimate the accuracy of the calculation for the perturbative part of the full decay width Γ(τ  →  ν + hadrons) when the analytic continuation effects are summed up in all orders of the perturbative [formula]-expansion.

An expression for the full width of the decay τ  →  ν + hadrons can be written down in the form [\cite=5]

[formula]

where the perturbative contribution of the strong interactions rH which we are interested in is given by the following spectral integral

[formula]

The spectral density r(s) is determined by the correlator of weak hadronic currents (see refs. [\cite=3] [\cite=4] [\cite=5] for more details) and is connected with the theoretically calculable quantity d(Q2) [\cite=6] by the Källen-Lehmann representation

[formula]

The perturbative expansion of the function d(Q2) in the running strong interactions coupling constant [formula] looks like

[formula]

where the coefficients a1, ~ a2, ~ a3 are determined by the divergent parts of the three, four, five loop Feynman diagrams correspondingly.

To calculate the full decay width through eqs. ([\ref=1]) and ([\ref=2]) it is necessary to find the moments of the spectral density r(s)

[formula]

An accurate definition of such moments can be given with the help of the integration contour which goes along the positive semi axis coinciding with the cut in the complex Q2 plane and closes itself far enough from all physical singularities [\cite=7] [\cite=8] [\cite=9] [\cite=10]. The result for these moments does not depend on the explicit way of the closing of the contour if it lies in the analyticity region of the function d(Q2). Choosing the circle of the radius m2τ for the closing of the contour we get the representation for the moments in the following form [\cite=11]

[formula]

where the function p(Q2) is given by the expression

[formula]

The running strong coupling constant h(Q2) satisfies the standard renormalization group equation

[formula]

and the coefficients of the expansion for the β-function are equal to β0 = 9, β1 = 64, β2 = 3863 / 6 in the [formula]-renormalization scheme for NF = 3 [\cite=13].

At the contour Q2 = m2τeiφ, -  π  <  φ  <  π the running strong coupling constant h(Q2) becomes the complex function of the angle φ and the renormalization group equation takes the form

[formula]

Setting h(Q2) = h(m2τ)(u + iv)- 1 at the contour one gets for the functions u(φ) and v(φ) the system of equations in the given approximation ([\ref=7]) for the β-function

[formula]

with the initial conditions u(0) = 1, v(0) = 0.

Formulas ([\ref=5],[\ref=6],[\ref=9]) allow to sum up all the regular corrections in h(m2τ) to the moments rn of the spectral density r(s) with the renormalization group technique. The naive expression for the moments rn can be obtained by expanding the exact formulas in the series in h(m2τ) and can be also found by the following simple trick. The renormalization group properties of the quantity r(s) up to the order O(h(μ2)3) can be explicitly expressed in the form

[formula]

where L =  ln (μ2 / s) and we have taken into account the representation ([\ref=3]) and expression ([\ref=4]). After integrating eq. ([\ref=10]) over the interval (0,m2τ) (more precisely the corresponding function p(Q2) along the contour in the complex plane of the variable Q2) we get formally the following expression for the zero moment, for example, at μ2 = m2τ

[formula]

where we use the simple notation h = h(μ2).

It is clear that such an integration generates a good deal of regular terms connected with the coefficients of the β-function which can and must be summed up with the renormalization group technique [\cite=12].

A following remark is in order here. Within the naive approach, eq. ([\ref=10]), it is not clear how many terms of the expansion in h(μ2) must be kept. In ref. [\cite=5], for example, all terms of the same order as in the expansion for the d(Q2)-function were kept in the h-expansion for the spectral density r(s) in the [formula]-renormalization scheme. This prescription does not work if the so called effective renormalization scheme is used for the function d(Q2) in which the corrections are absent at all due to definition (a1 = 0, a2 = 0, ai = 0 for i > 2) [\cite=14]. Within our approach all regular terms determined by the expansion of the β-function are summed up and the action instruction is fully independent of the choice of the renormalization scheme for the quantity d(Q2). After integration by parts in eq. ([\ref=5]) we get the representation for the moments

[formula]

where

[formula]

[formula]

and k1 = a1 - c1, k2 = a2 - c2 + c21 - a1c1, c1  =  β1  /  β0, c2  =  β2  /  β0, the variables u and v in formula ([\ref=11]) denote the values of the solution to the system of equations ([\ref=9]) at the point φ  =  π, while the quantities Δn are determined by the integrals

[formula]

Substituting the solution of the system of equations ([\ref=9]) into formulas ([\ref=11]-[\ref=12]) one gets after performing the integration the numerical values for the moments rn of the spectral density r(s) with the full summation of the analytic continuation effects by the renormalization group method. The experimental value obtained for the quantity rH from the relation (1) after averaging over several possible ways of extracting the numerical value for Γ(τ  →  ν + hadrons) and Γ(τ-) = Γ(τ-  →  ντe-) is equal to [\cite=5]

[formula]

The theoretical prediction is based on formula ([\ref=2]) and is expressed through the moments of the spectral density r(s) as follows

[formula]

The naive expression for the quantity rH up to the order O(h3) has the form

[formula]

where hN denotes the running coupling constant h extracted from the naive formula ([\ref=15]) and the coefficients a1, a2 are a1 = 6.564 [\cite=15], a2 = 102.0 [\cite=16] in the [formula]-scheme of renormalization.

The results of determination of the running coupling constant h and the QCD-parameter [formula] in the different approximations in the coupling constant with the help of formulas ([\ref=14]) and ([\ref=15]) are given in Tables 1-3. The mass scale of QCD [formula] is determined through the numerical value of the running coupling constant h according to the relation

[formula]

where β(2)(h) =  - β0h2  -  β1h3.

It is seen from the results given in the Tables that the difference between the exact value (summed up in all orders in h) and the naive one becomes smaller with the improvement of the approximation i.e. after taking into account the larger number of corrections in h. It is explained by the obvious observation that the leading term of the difference between the exact result and the naive one has formally the next order in h in comparison with the kept terms (cf. the situation with the usual renormalization group summation of the perturbative corrections). Since the quantity h (more precisely rH ([\ref=13])) is small enough the estimate of the analytic continuation effects by means of the expansion of exact formulas ([\ref=5],[\ref=14]) into the series in h is valid numerically. For the value 12rH = 1, however, the situation is essentially changed even numerically as it can be seen from the last lines of the tables although the estimates remain obviously unchanged parametrically. Even for the moderate numerical values of rH, for example, 12rH = 0.5, however, the change of the parameters h and [formula] under taking into consideration the next approximation in h is comparable in the magnitude with the changes influenced by the summation of the analytic continuation effects. The accuracy of experimental determination of the quantity rH is permanently getting improved and after accomplishing the construction of and putting into operation the c - τ-factories [\cite=17] will be considerably better. So, if rH  =  H  +  ΔrH then at H = 0.60 and ΔrH = 0.03 one can reliably tell apart the exact and naive results for h and [formula].

In conclusion I would like to stress once again the main result of the paper. The knowledge of the analytic and renormalization group properties of the function d(Q2) allows to sum up all the regular contributions into the moments of the spectral density r(s) in all orders of perturbation theory in the strong coupling constant [formula]. The summation of such contributions at the calculation of the inclusive semileptonic width of the τ-lepton is necessary for precise comparison of the parameters [formula] extracted from the different processes depending on different energy scales.
