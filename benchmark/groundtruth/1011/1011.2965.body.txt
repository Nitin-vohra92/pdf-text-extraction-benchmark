Weakly uniform rank two vector bundles on multiprojective spaces

Introduction

We denote by [formula] the n-dimensional projective space aver an algebraic field of characteristic zero. A rank r vector bundle E on [formula] is said to be it uniform if there is a sequence of integers [formula] with [formula] such that for every line L on [formula], [formula]. The sequence [formula] is called the splitting type of E. The classification of these bundles is known in many cases: rank E  ≤  n with n  ≥  2 (see [\cite=vdv], [\cite=sa], [\cite=ehs]); rank E = n + 1 for n = 2 and n = 3 (see [\cite=ele], [\cite=el2]); rank E = 5 for n = 3 (see [\cite=be]). Nevertheless there are uniform vector bundles (of rank 2n) which are not homogeneous (see [\cite=dr]). In [\cite=bn] the authors gave the notion of weakly uniform bundle on [formula]. For the study of rank two weakly uniform vector bundles on [formula], see [\cite=s], [\cite=ns] and [\cite=bn]. Here we are interested on vector bundles on multiprojective spaces. Fix integers s  ≥  2 and ni  ≥  1. Let [formula] be a multiprojective space. Let

[formula]

be the projection on the i-th factor. For all 1  <  i  <  j let

[formula]

denote the projection onto the product of the i-th factor and the j-th factor. Set O: = OX. For all integers [formula] set [formula]. We recall that every line bundle on X is isomorphic to a unique line bundle [formula]. Set [formula]. Let

[formula]

be the projection. Hence [formula] for each P∈Xi. Let E be a rank r vector bundle on X. We say that E is weakly uniform with splitting type (ah,i), 1  ≤  h  ≤  r, 1  ≤  i  ≤  s, if for all [formula], every P∈Xi and every line D  ⊆  π- 1i(P) the vector bundle E|D on [formula] has splitting type [formula]. A weakly uniform vector bundle E on X is called uniform if there is a line bundles [formula] such that the splitting types of [formula] with respect to all πi are the same. In this case a splitting type of E is the splitting type [formula], r: = (E), of [formula]. Notice that the r-ple of integers [formula] is not uniquely determined by E, but that the (s - 1)-ple [formula] depends only from E. Indeed, a rank r weakly uniform vector bundle E of splitting type (ah,i), 1  ≤  h  ≤  r, 1  ≤  i  ≤  s, is uniform if and only if there are s - 1 integers dj, 2  ≤  j  ≤  s, such that ah,i  =  ah,1 + di for all [formula]. If E is uniform, then the r-ples [formula], [formula], are exactly the splitting types of E. If E is uniform it is usually better to consider [formula] instead of E, because all the splitting types of [formula] as a weakly uniform vector bundle are the same.

In this paper we prove the following result:

Let E be a rank 2 vector bundle on X. E is weakly uniform if and only if there are L∈(X), indices 1  ≤  i  <  j  ≤  s and a rank 2 weakly uniform vector bundle G on [formula] such that [formula]. E splits if either ni  ≥  3 or nj  ≥  3. If 1  ≤  n1  ≤  2, 1  ≤  n2  ≤  2 and (n1,n2)  ≠  (1,1), then E splits unless there is h∈{1,2} such that nh = 2 and [formula] for some L∈(X).

Moreover we discuss the case of higher rank. We show that every rank r > 2 weakly uniform vector bundle with splitting type [formula] is trivial and every rank r > 2 uniform vector bundle with splitting type [formula], splits. Our methods did not allowed us to attack other splitting types.

Weakly uniform rank two vector bundles

In order to prove Theorem [\ref=i1] we need a few lemmas. We first consider the case s = 2.

Assume s = 2, n1 = 1 and n2  =  2. Let E be a rank 2 vector bundle on [formula]. E is weakly uniform if and only if either E splits as the direct sum of 2 line bundles or there is a line bundle L on [formula] such that [formula].

Since the " if " part is obvious, it is sufficient to prove the " only if " part. Let (ah,i), 1  ≤  h  ≤  2, 1  ≤  i  ≤  s, be the splitting type of E. Up to a twist by a line bundle we may assume a1,1  =  a1,2  =  0. By rigidity or looking at the Chern classes [formula], i = 1,2, it is easy to see that if one of these two cases occurs for some Q, then it occurs for all Q. First assume a2,2 = 0. Since the trivial line bundle on [formula] is spanned, the theorem of changing basis implies that [formula] is a rank 2 vector bundle on [formula] and that the natural map [formula] is an isomorphism ([\cite=oss], p. 11). Since E is weakly uniform, F is uniform. The classification of all rank 2 uniform vector bundles on [formula] shows that either F splits or it is isomorphic to a twist of [formula] (see [\cite=ehs]), concluding the proof in the case a2,2 = 0. Similarly, if a2,1 = 0, there is a rank 2 vector bundle G on [formula] such that [formula]. Since every vector bundle on [formula] splits, we have that also E splits. Now we may assume a2,2 < 0 and a2,1  <  0. Since a2,2 < 0, the base-change theorem gives that [formula] is a line bundle, say of degree b2, and that the natural map [formula] has locally free cokernel ([\cite=oss], p. 11). Thus in this case E fits in an exact sequence

[formula]

The term a2,1 in the last line bundle of ([\ref=eqa2]) comes from c1(E). If ([\ref=eqa2]) splits, then we are done. Since a2,1  ≤  1, Künneth's formula gives [formula]. Hence ([\ref=eqa2]) splits.

Assume s = 2, n1 = 1 and n2  ≥  3. Then every rank two weakly uniform vector bundle on X is the direct sum of two line bundles.

We copy the proof of Lemma [\ref=a1]. Every rank 2 uniform vector bundle on [formula], m  ≥  3, splits. Hence E splits even in the case a2,2 = 0.

Assume s = 2 and n1 = n2 = 2. Let E be a rank 2 indecomposable weakly uniform vector bundle on X. Then either [formula] or [formula].

Let (ah,i) be the splitting type of E. Up to a twist by a line bundle we may assume a1,1 = a1,2 = 0. As in the proof of Lemma [\ref=a1] the theorem of changing basis gives that either [formula] or E splits if a2,1 = 0 and that [formula] or E splits if a2,2 = 0. If a2,1 < 0 and a2,2 < 0, then we apply [formula] and get an exact sequence ([\ref=eqa2]). Here Künneth's formula gives that ([\ref=eqa2]) splits, without using any information on the integer a2,2.

Assume s = 2, n1  ≥  3 and n2 = 2. Let E be a rank 2 weakly uniform vector bundle on X. Then either E splits or [formula] for some integers u,v.

Let (ahi) be the splitting type of E. Up to a twist by a line bundle we may assume a1,1  =  a1,2 = 0. As in the proof of Lemma [\ref=a1] the theorem of changing basis gives that [formula] or E splits if a2,1 = 0 and that E splits in the case a1,2 < 0, because ([\ref=eqa2]) splits by Künneth's formula.

Assume s = 2, n1  ≥  3 and n2  ≥  3. Let E be a rank 2 weakly uniform vector bundle on X. Then E splits.

Let (ahi) be the splitting type of E. Up to a twist by a line bundle we may assume a1,1  =  a1,2 = 0. If a2,2 = 0, then base change gives [formula] for some uniform vector bundle on [formula]. Thus we may assume a2,2 < 0. We have again the extension ([\ref=eqa2]). Here again ([\ref=eqa2]) splits by Künneth's formula.

Now are ready to prove the main theorem:

First assume s = 2. Theorem [\ref=i1] says nothing in the case n1 = n2 = 1 for which a full classification is not known ([\cite=bn] shows that moduli arises). Lemmas [\ref=a1], [\ref=a2], [\ref=a3], [\ref=a4] and [\ref=a5] cover all cases with s = 2. Hence we may assume s  ≥  3 and use induction on s. If ni = 1 for all i, then we may apply [\cite=bn], Theorem 4. For arbitrary ni the proof of [\cite=bn], Theorem 4, works verbatim, but for reader's sake we repeat that proof. Let (ahi) be the splitting type of E. Up to a twist by a line bundle we may assume a1i = 0 for all i. If a2i = 0 for some i, then the base-change theorem gives [formula] for some weakly uniform vector bundle F on Xi. If s = 3, then we are done. In the general case we reduce to the case s': = s - 1. Thus to complete the proof it is sufficient either to obtain a contradiction or to get that E splits under the additional condition that a2i  <  0 for all i and s  ≥  3. Applying the base-change theorem to [formula] we get that E fits in the following extension

[formula]

Since - a1,2  ≥  0, Künneth's formula shows that ([\ref=eqa3]) splits unless ni = 1 for all i  ≥  2. Using [formula] instead of [formula] we get that E splits, unless n1 = 1.

Higher rank weakly uniform vector bundles

Now we consider higher rank weakly uniform vector bundles.

Let E be a rank r weakly uniform vector bundle on X with splitting type [formula]. Then E is trivial.

The case s = 1 is true by [\cite=oss], Theorem 3.2.1. Hence we may assume s  ≥  2 and use induction on s. By the inductive assumption E|π- 11(P) is trivial for each [formula]. By the base change theorem [formula] is a rank r vector bundle on X1 and the natural map [formula] is an isomorphism. This isomorphism implies that F is uniform of splitting type [formula]. Hence the inductive assumption gives that F is trivial. Thus E is trivial.

In order to study uniform vector bundles with [formula] we need the following lemmas:

Fix an integer r  ≥  2 and a rank r vector bundle on X. Assume the existence of an integer [formula] such that E|π- 1i(P) is the direct sum of line bundles for all P∈Xi. If ni = 1 assume that the splitting type of E|π- 1i(P) is the same for all P∈Xi. Let [formula], [formula], [formula], be the splitting type of E|π- 1(P) for any P∈Xi. Then there are k vector bundles [formula] on Xi and k vector bundles [formula] on X such that (Fi) = mi, Ek = E, Ei - 1 is a subbundle of Ei and [formula] (with the convention E0 = 0).

Notice that even in the case ni  ≥  2 the splitting type of E|π- 1(P) does not depend from the choice of P∈Xi (e.g. use Chern classes or local rigidity of direct sums of line bundles). Thus [formula] for all P∈Xi. Set [formula]. By the base-change theorem F1 is a rank m1 vector bundle on Xi and the natural map [formula] is a vector bundle embedding, i.e. either ρ is an isomorphism (case r = m1) or (ρ) is a rank r - m1 vector bundle on X. If m1 = r, then k = 1 and we are won. Now assume k  ≥  2, i.e. m1 < r. Fix any P∈Xi. By definition (ρ) fits in an exact sequence of vector bundles on X:

[formula]

and the restriction to π- 1i(P) of the injective map of ([\ref=eqa1]) induces an embedding of vector bundles [formula]. Since b1 > bj for all j > 1, we get [formula]. We apply to (ρ) the inductive assumption on k.

Assume s = 2 and n1  ≥  2, n2  ≥  3. Fix an integer r such that 3  ≤  r  ≤  n2 and a rank r uniform vector bundle E with splitting type [formula]. Then E is isomorphic to a direct sum of r line bundles.

Since r  ≥  3, we have ar  ≤  a1 - 2. Thus the classification of uniform vector bundles on [formula] with rank r  ≤  n2, gives [formula] for all [formula]. Apply Lemma [\ref=b2] with respect to the integers i = 1 and k = r and let Fi,Ei, 1  ≤  i  ≤  r, be the vector bundles given by the lemma. Since Er  =  E, it is sufficient to prove that each Ei is a direct sum of i line bundles. Since (Ei)  =  i, the latter assertion is obvious if i = 1. Fix an integer i such that 1  ≤  i  <  r and assume that Ei is isomorphic to a direct sum of i line bundles. Lemma [\ref=b2] gives an extension

[formula]

with L a line bundle on [formula]. Since n1  ≥  2 and n2  ≥  2, Künneth's formula gives that any extension of two line bundles on [formula] splits. Thus Ei + 1 is a direct sum of i + 1 line bundles.

Fix an integer r  ≥  3 and a rank r uniform vector bundle on X with splitting type [formula]. Assume s  ≥  2, n2  ≥  r and ni  ≥  2 for all i  ≠  2. Then E is isomorphic to a direct sum of r line bundles.

The case s = 2 is Lemma [\ref=o1]. Thus we may assume s  ≥  3 and that the proposition is true for [formula]. By the inductive assumption [formula] for all [formula]. As in the proof of Lemma [\ref=b2] taking instead of πi the projection [formula] we get line bundles Li, 1  ≤  i  ≤  r of [formula], (i.e. line bundles [formula] on X) and subbundles [formula] such that [formula] (with the convention E0 = 0). It is sufficient to prove that each Ei is isomorphic to a direct sum of i line bundles. Since this is obvious for i = 1, we may use induction on i. Fix an integer [formula]. Our assumption on X implies that the extension of any two line bundles splits. Hence [formula].
