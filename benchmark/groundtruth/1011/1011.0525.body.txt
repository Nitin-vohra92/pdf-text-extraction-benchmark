Introduction

Let R be a commutative ring with 1, and let [formula] be any sequence of elements of R. Let k,n be nonnegative integers such that k  ≤  n. We define the finite sequence [formula] of elements of R in the following way:

[formula]

and,

[formula]

We also define the sequence [formula] to be

[formula]

For a fixed positive integer k we let [formula] denote the sequence which a generating function is [formula] Thus,

[formula]

When the b's are nonnegative integers, then [formula] is the number of generalized compositions of n into k parts [\cite=mil2], Theorem 1). Also, It is proved in [\cite=mil1] that, in this case, [formula] is the number of all generalized compositions of n.

In Section 2 we derive a recurrence equation for [formula] Further we find a generating function for [formula] In Section 3 we apply the results obtained in Section 2, on usual compositions. Finally, in Section 4 we derive some results for generalized compositions.

A generating function

Let n be a positive integer, and let [formula] be a sequence in R. Then

[formula]

We use induction on n. For n = 1 the assertion is clearly true. Suppose that it is true for k < n. We have

[formula]

Changing the order of summation we obtain

[formula]

Taking into account that [formula] if m > 0, and then applying the induction hypothesis we get

[formula]

that is

[formula]

and the proposition is true.

Next, for a positive integer k, by [formula] we denote the sequence which a generating function is

[formula]

Hence,

[formula]

Thus,

[formula]

where the sum is taken over [formula]

Let n,k be nonnegative integers such that k  ≤  n. Then,

[formula]

For n = k we have [formula] and the assertion is true. Assume that k < n. We shall prove the proposition by induction on k.

[formula]

For k = 1 equation ([\ref=oz]) takes the form:

[formula]

Since [formula] we have

[formula]

and the assertion is true for k = 1.

Assume that k > 1, and that the assertion is true for k - 1. We obviously have

[formula]

Using ([\ref=oz]) we may write this equation in the form:

[formula]

so that,

[formula]

By comparing the terms of xn - k, in the preceding equation, we obtain

[formula]

Using the induction hypothesis we obtain

[formula]

and the assertion follows from ([\ref=kgk]).

As an immediate consequence we have

[formula]

Some results on compositions

In this section we assume that each bi is either 1 or 0. It is proved in [\cite=mil3] that then [formula] counts the number of compositions of n into k parts, all of which are in the set {i:bi = 1}. Also, in this case the generating function g(x,k) is similar to the function defined in [\cite=h2]. The number [formula] counts the number of all such compositions.

If [formula], then [formula] count the number of nonnegative solutions of the Diophant equation

[formula]

Hence,

[formula]

Assume that there is a positive number m such that [formula] Then [formula] counts the number of nonnegative solutions of the Diophant equation

[formula]

in which each term is ≤  m.

1. The first assertion follows from ([\ref=kv]). The second assertion follows from the well-known fact that the Diophant equation in 1. has exactly [formula] solutions.

2. The assertion follows from ([\ref=kv]).

In the next result we prove that, when each part of a composition belong to a fixed finite set, containing 1, then the number of compositions is a sum of multinomial coefficients. The case when 1 does not belong to the set is easily reduced to this case.

Assume that ri = 1 if [formula] and ri = 0 otherwise. Then

[formula]

where the sum on the right-hand side is taken over all nonnegative solutions of the Diophant equations

[formula]

In this case, the formula ([\ref=fb]) becomes

[formula]

Using the multinomial formula yields

[formula]

where the sum oh the right-hand side is taken over all nonnegative solutions of the Diophant equation

[formula]

and the proposition follows from Proposition [\ref=pp2].

The simplest case is s = 1,  r1 = 2.

The number of the compositions of n with k parts, each equals either 1 or 2 is [formula]

Next, suppose that s = 1,  r1 = m > 2. Then,

[formula]

where i0 + i1 = k,  (m - 1)i1 = n - k. The last equation has a solution if and only if m - 1 divides n - k.

We thus obtain the closed formulas for the number of compositions into k parts and for the number of all compositions.

Let n,k,m be positive integers with m > 1. For the number [formula] of compositions of n with k parts, all of which are either 1 or m we have is

[formula]

if m - 1 divides n - k, and 0 otherwise. For the number of all such compositions we have

[formula]

This kind of compositions is investigated in [\cite=c1].

Let n,m be positive integers, and let ri = 1 if i = 1( mod m), and ri = 0 otherwise. Then

[formula]

and [formula] otherwise.

According to ([\ref=pp1]), for the usual composition the formula ([\ref=oz]) has the form

[formula]

The proposition follows by replacing x by xm.

Let n be a positive integer. Then,

[formula]

where the sum is taken over k, such that k and n are of the same parity.

For m = 2, the numbers [formula] from the preceding proposition count the numbers of compositions with odd parts. Hence, [formula] if n and k are of the same parity, and [formula] otherwise. On the other hand, it is proved in Corollary 26, in [\cite=mil1], that the number of all compositions of n is Fn.

In the paper [\cite=c3] the compositions without part equals 2 are considered. We have derived a closed formula for the number of such compositions with k parts. From the formula all results from Theorem 4 to Theorem 9, in [\cite=c3], may be derived.

Let n,k be positive integers such that k  ≤  n. If ck(n) is the number of compositions of n with k parts, all different of 2, then

[formula]

Equation ([\ref=oz]), in this case, take the form:

[formula]

Using the binomial theorem and ([\ref=gf1]) we obtain

[formula]

It follows that

[formula]

The propositions now follows from Proposition [\ref=pp2].

The number Ck(k + 8) of k + 8 into k parts, all of which are different from 2, is

[formula]

In this case we have

[formula]

and the corollary is true.

Similarly, we obtain the formula for the compositions without parts equal m, for any m.

Let n,k be positive integer such that k  ≤  n, let m be a nonnegative integer, and [formula]

[formula]

where [formula]

We consider here the compositions without parts equal m + 1. The generating function for the number of such compositions with k parts is

[formula]

that is,

[formula]

Using ([\ref=gf1]) and the multinomial formula yields

[formula]

where

[formula]

It follows that

[formula]

where [formula] and the proposition follows.

From the preceding proposition we may obtain several closed formula for the numbers of compositions considered in Section 5, [\cite=c2]. On of them is the following:

Let n,k be positive integers such that k  ≤  n. Then the number c(3)k(n) of the compositions of n into k parts with no occurrence of 3 is

[formula]

This is the case when m = 2. Equation ([\ref=hub1]) becomes

[formula]

that is,

[formula]

if the conditions n - 2k + j - i - 1  ≥  i - 1 is fulfilled. Changing the order of the summation and using the preceding condition we conclude that the corollary is true.

Some results for generalized compositions

It is proved in [\cite=mil3] that in the case when each ri is a nonnegative integer, then [formula] is the number of the generalized compositions of n with k parts. Also, [formula] is the number of all generalized compositions of n. In the paper [\cite=g1], the author considered the compositions when there are two types of one, and one type of all other natural numbers. But, no a formula for the number of such compositions with a fixed number of parts is derived. We start this section with such a formula, but in a more general case when there are any number of ones.

Let n,k be nonnegative integers such that k  ≤  n, let m be a nonnegative integer, and let r0 = 1 + m,  ri = 1,  (i > 0). Then,

[formula]

In this case we have

[formula]

Using binomial formula we obtain

[formula]

Equation xx implies

[formula]

It follows that

[formula]

and the proposition is true.

In particular, if m = 1, the in [\cite=g1] is proved that F2n + 1 is the number of all compositions of this kind. Thus,

The following identity is true

[formula]

where F2n + 1 is the Fibonacci number.

Let n,k,m be positive integer such that k  ≤  n, and let [formula] Then,

[formula]

We have

[formula]

Using the binomial formula implies

[formula]

and the proposition is true.

In the next result we show that when the b's are pyramidal numbers then the number of compositions is a pyramidal number also.

Let n,k,m be positive integer such that k  ≤  n, and let [formula] Then,

[formula]

From ([\ref=gf1]) follows

[formula]

and the proposition is true according to ([\ref=oz]).

In the case m = 2 we have [formula] so that,

[formula]

which is the result of Theorem 1, [\cite=ag].

Let n,k be positive integers such that k  ≤  n, and let [formula] Then

[formula]

It is a well-known that the generating function f(x) of the sequence [formula] is

[formula]

It follows that

[formula]

According to ([\ref=oz]) we conclude that

[formula]

and the proposition is proved.
