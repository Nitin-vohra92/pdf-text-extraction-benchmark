Introduction

Simons [\cite=Simons] proved a binomial coefficient identity which is equivalent to

[formula]

Several different proofs of [\eqref=eq1] were given by [\cite=Chapman] [\cite=Prodinger] [\cite=Sun]. Using Cauchy's integral formula as in [\cite=Prodinger], Munarini [\cite=Munarini] obtained the following generalization

[formula]

where α,β,x and y are indeterminates. It is clear that [\eqref=eq2] reduces to [\eqref=eq1] when α  =  β = n and y = 1. Shattuck [\cite=Shattuck] and Chen and Pang [\cite=Chen] provided two interesting combinatorial proofs of [\eqref=eq2].

Recently, Guo [\cite=Guo] obtained the following multinomial coefficient generalization of [\eqref=eq2] as follows:

[formula]

where [formula], [formula] [formula], the multinomial coefficient [formula] is defined by and [formula] for [formula] and [formula].

In this paper we shall give an involutive proof of [\eqref=eq3], answering a question of Guo [\cite=Guo]. Our proof is motivated by Shattuck's work [\cite=Shattuck].

The Involutive Proof

Note that both sides of ([\ref=eq3]) are polynomials in [formula] and [formula]. We may only consider the case of positive integers with β  ≥  α. We first understand the unsigned quantity in the sum of the left-hand side of ([\ref=eq3]). Let [formula] be an alphabet. We construct the weighted words [formula] on Γ as follows:

We call such a weighted words w a configuration, and define its weight as the product of the weights of all the wi's. It is not hard to see that the sum of the weights of the configurations defined above is equal to [formula] for any [formula].

Let S+ and S- denote the sets of configurations with an even or odd number of circled positions, respectively. We pair members w of S+ and S- by identifying the first wj with weight yi (1  ≤  i  ≤  m) in [formula], either circling it or uncircling it. Here we give an example for β = 4,α = 2 and [formula]:

This pairs all configurations except those where every position weighted yi is in the right α positions. These configurations w must belong to S+ and the sum of their weights is equal to the right-hand side of [\eqref=eq3]. This is because if the subwords with elements weighted yi (1  ≤  i  ≤  m) in [formula] is a permutation of [formula], then there are [formula] possible ways to choose the remaining subwords of w, where each bi is weighted xi. This proves [\eqref=eq3].
