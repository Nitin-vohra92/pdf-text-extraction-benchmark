The result

Let us remind that

[formula]

The following theorem holds true.

Let

[formula]

Then we obtain from ([\ref=1.2])

[formula]

especially, i.e., the function Ω(δ) possesses the property of the asymptotic multiplicability.

Let be the factorization of a natural number n. Then we have (see ([\ref=1.4]) for example.

The main formula

Let us remind that

[formula]

(see ([\ref=1.1]), ([\ref=2.1]) and [\cite=1], p. 3). The following lemma holds true.

[formula]

for σ > 1, s = σ + it.

We apply the formula ([\cite=2], p. 2)

[formula]

Since

[formula]

then we obtain from ([\ref=2.3])

[formula]

Next (see ([\ref=2.1])) and

[formula]

then from ([\ref=2.5]) by ([\ref=2.1]), ([\ref=2.6]) the formula ([\ref=2.2]) follows.

The differentiation of the formula (2.2)

Let [formula] denote the open rectangle generated by the points [formula] (0 < δ is the sufficiently small fixed value). The following lemma holds true.

[formula]

where

[formula]

We use the formula (see ([\ref=2.2]), ([\ref=2.4]))

[formula]

Since (x) = , and (x), x∈(pn,pn + 1) is continuous (pn is a prime number, p1 = 2) then wn(s), s∈Π1 is an analytic function. Next, the uniform convergence of the series in the set Π1 follows from the uniform convergence of the integral (see ([\ref=3.1]) in the set Π1. Thus, by the theorem of Weierstrass, the integral in ([\ref=3.3]) is an analytic function in Π1. Since

[formula]

then we have (see ([\ref=3.3]), ([\ref=3.4]))

[formula]

Similarly, we obtain

[formula]

Finally, we obtain the formula ([\ref=3.1]) by the differentiation of ([\ref=2.2]), (see ([\ref=3.5]), ([\ref=3.6])).

Cancelation of the singular parts corresponding to the pole at s = 1. The pole at [formula]

Let Π2 denote the open rectangle generated by the points [formula]. The following lemma holds true.

[formula]

where g(s), s∈Π2 is the analytic and bounded function.

Let (see ([\ref=3.1]))

[formula]

First of all (see ([\ref=3.2]))

[formula]

Since and similarly then (see ([\ref=4.2]), ([\ref=4.3]))

[formula]

where g4(s),s∈Π2 is the analytic and bounded function. Next, by the known formula

[formula]

where ζ(ρn) = 0, and g5(s), s∈Π2 is the analytic and bounded function. Finally, from ([\ref=3.1]) by ([\ref=4.2])-([\ref=4.5]) the asertion of the Lemma 3 follows.

The analytic continuation of the formula ([\ref=3.1])

The following lemma holds true.

On the Riemann hypothesis

[formula]

where g(σ), σ∈[null] is the bounded function.

Let Π2(δ) denote the open rectangle generated by the points [formula]. We obtain from ([\ref=3.2])

[formula]

Next, on the Riemann hypothesis, the following estimate of von Koch

[formula]

holds true (comp. ([\ref=2.1])). Then we have (see ([\ref=5.2]), ([\ref=5.3])) i.e. the integral is the analytic function. Finally, from the formula ([\ref=4.1]), s∈Π1, (g(s), s∈Π2 is the analytic function) by the method of analytic continuation we obtain the formula from which the formula ([\ref=5.1]) follows.

Since (see ([\ref=5.2])) we obtain, putting (x) = P(x) + K (see ([\ref=2.1])) in ([\ref=5.1]), the following lemma

On the Riemann hypothesis

[formula]

where (σ), σ∈[null] is the bounded function.

Proof of the Theorem

Since (see ([\ref=3.2]), comp. ([\ref=5.2]), ([\ref=5.3])) then (see ([\ref=5.4])) Putting here [formula], we obtain the formula

[formula]

However, (see ([\ref=5.3]))

[formula]

The formula ([\ref=1.2]) follows from ([\ref=6.1]) by ([\ref=6.2]).
