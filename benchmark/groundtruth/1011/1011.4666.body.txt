Introduction

Let G be a graph with the vertex set [formula]. The adjacency matrix of G is an n  ×  n matrix A(G) whose (i,j)-entry is 1 if vi is adjacent to vj and 0 otherwise. The characteristic polynomial of G, denoted by φ(G;x), is the characteristic polynomial of A(G). We will drop the indeterminate x for simplicity of notation whenever there is no danger of confusion. The zeros of φ(G) are called the eigenvalues of G. Note that A(G) is a real symmetric matrix so that all eigenvalues of G are reals. The graph G is said to be integral if all eigenvalues of G are integers.

The notion of integral graphs was first introduced in [\cite=har]. The general characterization problem of integral graphs seems to be intractable. Therefore, it is natural to deal with the problem within specific classes of graphs such as trees, cubic graphs and so on. Here, we are concerned with finding integral trees. These objects are extremely rare and very difficult to find. For instance, among trees up to 50 vertices there are only 28 integral ones [\cite=b] and out of a total number of 2,262,366,343,746 trees on 35 vertices only one tree is integral. For a long time, it has been an open question whether there exist integral trees of any diameter [\cite=watsc]. Many attempts by various authors led to the constructions of integral trees of diameters 2-8 and 10, see [\cite={hic}] [\cite={hic1}] [\cite={hic2}] [\cite={liu}] [\cite={wan}] [\cite={wan1}] [\cite={wat}]. Recently, Csikvári found a nice construction of integral trees for any even diameter [\cite=csi]. In the odd case, all integral trees of diameter 3 have been characterized by a result from number theory given in [\cite=gra]. Infinitely many integral trees of diameter 5 were first constructed in [\cite=liu]. The existence of integral trees of diameter 7 was established in [\cite=hic1] where the authors found four such trees. In this paper, we show that for every odd integer n > 1, there are infinitely many integral trees of diameter n.

Csikvári's trees

In this section, we revisit the trees constructed in [\cite=csi] and compute their eigenvalues using a simple argument. We will make use of them to construct new integral trees of odd diameters.

A rooted tree is a tree with a specified vertex called the root. For a rooted tree T, we denote by T' the forest resulting from removing the root of T. Let n be a positive integer and T1,T2 be two rooted trees with disjoint vertex sets. Then T1  ~  nT2 is the rooted tree obtained from T1 and n copies of T2 by joining the root of T1 to the roots of the copies of T2. The root of T1 is considered to be the root of the resulting tree. For positive integers [formula], we define the rooted tree [formula] constructed in [\cite=csi] recursively as

[formula]

for [formula], with initial trees C(  ) and C(r1) being the one-vertex tree and the star tree on r1 + 1 vertices, respectively.

The following lemma is proved in [\cite=cve] for n = 1. The general case is straightforward by induction on n.

Let T1,T2 be two rooted trees and let T  =  T1  ~  nT2. Then

[formula]

The following lemma can be used to determine the eigenvalues of Csikvári's trees and their multiplicities.

Let [formula] and [formula] be positive integers. Then

[formula]

It is not hard to see that diameter of [formula] is 2n provided that rn - rn - 1 > 1. The following theorem readily follows from Lemma [\ref=csi] which establishes the existence of infinitely many integral trees of any even diameter.

[\cite=csi] The set of distinct eigenvalues of the tree [formula] is [formula].

Let us introduce an alternative representation of [formula] and [formula] to be used in sequel. For [formula], we let

[formula]

where di = ri - ri - 1 with the convention r0 = 0. By Lemma [\ref=csi], f(C) is a polynomial and clearly we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

Note that by Lemma [\ref=csi], if rn - rn - 1 > 1, then the positive zeroes of f(C) read as [formula]

A class of trees

In this section, we introduce a class of trees which will be used to obtain integral trees of odd diameters. For positive integers [formula] such that [formula] and [formula], let [formula], [formula], [formula], and define

[formula]

Note that for n = 2, we let V = C(r0). It is easily checked that the maximum distance between a vertex of [formula] and its root is n. So [formula] is a tree of diameter 2n + 1. We proceed to determine φ(T). Applying Lemma [\ref=main1], we find that

[formula]

First assume that n = 2m + 1 is odd. By ([\ref=phif]) and ([\ref=qf]), we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

Hence, by ([\ref=odd1])-([\ref=odd2]), where

Next suppose that n = 2m is even. By ([\ref=phif]) and ([\ref=qf]), we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

Thus, by ([\ref=even1])-([\ref=even2]), where

In summary, using the above notation, we have the following theorem.

Let n be odd (respectively, even). Then T is an integral tree of diameter 2n + 1 if and only if [formula] are perfect squares and all the zeros of ψo(T) (respectively, ψe(T)) are integers.

Integral trees of diameter 4k + 1

Let n be even. It is not difficult to choose the parameters of T in such a way that the zeros of ψe(T) are all integers. For instance, let r0 = 1, r1 = 4k2, rn = (k2 - 1)2 and r = 4k2 - 1. Then

[formula]

Clearly, if we choose k large enough, then we are able to take distinct prefect squares [formula] in the interval (4k2,(k2 - 1)2). Hence, we have proved the following theorem.

For every even positive integer n, there are infinitely many integral trees of diameter 2n + 1.

Integral trees of diameter 4k + 3

Let n be odd. Our objective is to choose the parameters of T in such a way that all the zeros of ψo(T) are integers. This can be done in many ways. For instance, if we set r0 = r1 = a2 and r = rn = 4(a - 1)2 for some integer a with [formula], then

[formula]

The zeros of ψo(T) are ±  a and [formula]. So the zeros of ψo(T) are integers if and only if 12a2 - 20a + 9 is a perfect square, say b2. We have (6a - 5)2 - 3b2 =  - 2. From number theory, we know that the Pell-like equation x2 - 3y2 =  - 2 has infinitely many integral solutions with [formula]. For example, one may take

[formula]

for arbitrary integer [formula]. Therefore, we come up with the following theorem.

For every odd integer [formula], there are infinitely many integral trees of diameter 2n + 1.
