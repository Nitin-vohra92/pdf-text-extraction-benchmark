A triangle is a polygon with three vertices A,B,C connected by three sides (line segments) a,b,c. Figure [\ref=F1] shows the definition of the symbols [\cite=triangle]. Note that A,B,C are labeled in a counter clock wise fashion, if we look from the top. It is a two dimensional object since 3 points define a two dimensional plane.

When we analyze the symmetry of triangles we find equilateral triangles with a = b = c, which have C3v symmetry, i. e. three fold rotational symmetry and 3 mirror axes. The isosceles triangles have two sides with equal length, and C1v symmetry, i.e. one fold rotational symmetry and 1 mirror axe. All other triangles, where a  ≠  b  ≠  c  ≠  a are scalane and have no mirror symmetry. Since the concept of chirality and mirror symmetry may also be applied to two dimensional objects, scalane triangles are considered to be chiral. In two dimensions, the role of a mirror plane in three dimensional objects is taken by a mirror axis.

A measure for the chirality of a triangle [formula]

There are different possible sets for the definition of the chirality of a geometric object [\cite=Petitjean:2003]. Here we define a measure for the chirality of a triangle [formula] as :

[formula]

where a,b,c are the sides of the triangle, with the sense of rotation as defined in Figure [\ref=F1]. For example, the 3-tuple (a,b,c) = (9,10,11) has a [formula] of 7.4  ·  10- 5. [formula] is a dimensionless number and a bound quantity [formula], with [formula]. For triangle [formula] gets maximal (and minimal) when one side of the triangle is half of the circumference (a + b + c). For example, the tuple (10, 2, 8) represents such a triangle with a = b + c, which is with [formula] close to χmax.

In Figure [\ref=F2] the phase space of [formula] is shown as a function of (ā,), where ā, [formula] and [formula] are a, b and c normalized with the circumference (a + b + c), and where  = 1 - ā  -  . The 3 blue and 3 red areas, are separated by 3 nodal lines of isosceles triangles. The 6 segments represent the 3! possible permutations of the elements in a 3-tuple, (a,b,c), (c,a,b), (b,c,a), (b,a,c), (c,b,a) and (a,c,b). Note, for cyclic permutations we find [formula] and permutations of pairs lead to a change of sign of the chirality [formula], etc.

If triangles are classified according to Eqn. [\ref=E0], and if we assign the largest element to a, the phase space of [formula] is reduced by a factor of 3, i.e. to one blue and one red segment. If we order the labels of the sides to e.g. (a  ≥  b  ≥  c) we loose the information on the absolute chirality and can display all 3-tuples in one, for this case red segment in Figure [\ref=F2].

Generalisation of Eqn.[\ref=E0] to any 3-tuple

The definition of [formula] (Eqn.[\ref=E0]) also applies to the chiral classification of any three scalar quantities (3-tuples (a,b,c) with a > 0, b > 0, c > 0). Though, for 3-tuples that do not fulfil the triangle inequality as it is e.g. (a,b,c)=(1, 2, 8), [formula] gets 0.03, i.e. it can get larger than χmax.

Which [formula] indicate a significant chirality

In an experiment (a,b,c) can be measured up to an error (Δa,Δb,Δc). This imposes an error in [formula] that has to be known if it shall be decided whether [formula] is significantly different from zero, i.e. whether a tuple (a,b,c) may be considered to be chiral. It has therefore to be studied the influence of an error (Δa,Δb,Δc) on [formula].

In a scenario for equilateral triangles a = b = c with relative random errors [formula] = 0.2 we get for [formula] the histogram shown in Figure [\ref=F3]. 75% of the samples have a [formula] below the average [formula]. For this particular simulation with 105 samples, also χ-values >  χmax occur. This is related to the fact that certain 3-tuples can not be considered as sides of a triangle, since if sorted like a  >  c  ≥  b we find a - b - c  ≥  0, i.e. these samples (about 0.5% for 20% errors) do not fulfil the triangle inequality. On the right panel in Figure [\ref=F3] and in Table [\ref=T1] the 75% confidence values for different errors (relative precision of the side determination) are shown. This means for a triangle with [formula], whose sides are measured with 10% accuracy that it is with a probability of 75% chiral, and with a probability of 25% achiral.
