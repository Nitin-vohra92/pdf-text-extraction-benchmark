Further examples of stable bundles of rank 2 with 4 sections

Dedicated to the memory of Eckart Viehweg

Introduction

It has been apparent for some time that the classical Brill-Noether theory for line bundles on a smoooth irreducible curve does not extend readily to bundles of higher rank. Some aspects of this have been clarified recently by the introduction of Clifford indices of higher rank [\cite=ln]. An example of a stable rank-3 bundle with Clifford index less than the classical Clifford index on a general curve of genus 9 or 11 is given in [\cite=lmn], disproving a conjecture of Mercat [\cite=m]. Very recently, it was proved in [\cite=fo] that there exist curves of any genus ≥  11 for which the rank-2 Clifford index is strictly smaller than the classical Clifford index. In this paper we use the methods of [\cite=fo] to present further examples of this, showing in particular that the difference between the two Clifford indices can be arbitrarily large.

For any positive integer n the rank-n Clifford index γ'n(C) of a smooth projective curve of genus g  ≥  4 over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 is defined as follows. For any vector bundle E of rank n and degree d on C define

[formula]

Then

[formula]

Here γ1  =  γ'1 is the classical Clifford index of C and it is easy to see that γ'n  ≤  γ1 for all n.

The gonality sequence [formula] is defined by

[formula]

In classical terms dr is the minimum number d for which a grd exists. In the case of a general curve we have for all r,

[formula]

According to [\cite=m], [\cite=ln] a version of Mercat's conjecture states that

[formula]

As mentioned above, counterexamples in rank 3 and rank 2 are now known. For the rest of the paper we concentrate on rank 2.

For γ1  ≤  4 it is known that γ'2  =  γ1 (see [\cite=ln]). In any case, we have according to [\cite=ln]

[formula]

For the general curve of genus 11 we have γ1  =  5 and d4  =  13. So in this case, γ'2  =  5 or [formula]. It is shown in [\cite=fo] that there exist curves C of genus 11 with γ1  =  5 and [formula], but this cannot happen on a general curve of genus 11 [\cite=fo]. Counterexamples to the conjecture in higher genus were also constructed in [\cite=fo]. All examples E constructed in [\cite=fo] have [formula].

In this paper we use the methods of [\cite=fo] to generalize these examples. Our main result is the following theorem.

Suppose d  =  g - s with an integer s  ≥   - 1 and

[formula]

Suppose further that the quadratic form

[formula]

cannot take the value - 1 for any integers [formula]. Then there exists a curve C of genus g having [formula] and a stable bundle E of rank 2 on C with [formula] and hence

[formula]

In particular the difference γ1  -  γ'2 can be arbitrarily large.

This statement can also be written in terms of the Brill-Noether loci B(2,d,4) which are defined as follows. Let M(2,d) denote the moduli space of stable bundles of rank 2 and degree d on C. Then

[formula]

Theorem [\ref=thm1.1] says that under the given hypotheses B(2,g - s,4) is non-empty. It may be noted that the expected dimension of B(2,g - s,4) is - 4s - 11  <  0.

The key point in proving this theorem is the construction of the curves C, which all lie on K3-surfaces and are therefore not general, although they do have maximal Clifford index.

Suppose d  =  g - s with an integer s  ≥   - 1 and

[formula]

Then there exists a smooth K3-surface S of type (2,3) in [formula] containing a smooth curve C of genus g and degree d with

[formula]

where H is the polarization, such that S contains no divisor D with D2  =  0. Moreover, if S does not contain a ( - 2)-curve, then C is of maximal Clifford index [formula].

The proof of Theorem [\ref=thm1.2], which uses the methods of [\cite=f] and [\cite=fo], is given in Section 2. This is followed in Section 3 by the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm1.1].

Proof of Theorem 1.2

Let d  =  g - s with g  ≥  4s  +  14 and s  ≥   - 1. Then d2  -  6(2g - 2) is not a perfect square.

If d2 - 6(2g - 2)  =  g2  -  (2s  +  12)g  +  s2 + 12  =  m2 for some non-negative integer m, then the discriminant

[formula]

is a perfect square of the form (m + b)2 with b  ≥  2. Solving the equation g2  -  (2s  +  12)g  +  (s2 + 12  -  m2)  =  0 for g, we get

[formula]

Now, since b  ≥  2, we have (m  +  b  -  2)2  ≥  m2 and hence

[formula]

which gives m + b  ≤  3s  +  7. So [\eqref=eq2.1] implies g  ≤  4s  +  13, which contradicts the hypothesis.

Let g  ≥  4s  +  14 with s  ≥   - 1. Then there exists a smooth K3-surface S of type (2,3) in [formula] containing a smooth curve C of genus g and degree d  =  g - s with

[formula]

where H is the polarization, such that S contains no divisor D with D2  =  0.

The conditions of [\cite=k] are fulfilled to give the existence of S and C. Let

[formula]

We want to show that the equation D2  =  0 does not have an integer solution. Now

[formula]

For an integer solution we must have that the discriminant d2  -  6(2g - 2) is a perfect square and this contradicts Lemma [\ref=lem2.1].

Under the hypotheses of Proposition 2.2, the curve C is an ample divisor on S.

We show that C  ·  D  >  0 for any effective divisor on S which we may assume to be irreducible. So let D  ~  mH  +  nC be an irreducible curve on S. So

[formula]

Note first that, since H is a hyperplane, we have

[formula]

If m,n  ≥  0, then one of them has to be positive and then clearly C  ·  D  >  0. The case m,n  ≤  0 contradicts [\eqref=eq2.2].

Suppose m > 0 and n  <  0. Then, using [\eqref=eq2.2] we have

[formula]

So C  ·  D  >  0 for [formula], which holds, since g  ≥  4s + 14.

Finally, suppose m < 0 and n  >  0. Then, since we assumed D irreducible,

[formula]

If m  ≤   - 3 , then nC  ·  D  >  0. If m  =   - 1, we have

[formula]

The same argument works for m  =   - 2,  n  ≥  2. Finally, if m  =   - 2 and n  =  1, we still get C  ·  D  >  0 unless D  ·  H  =  1 and D2  =   - 2. Solving these equations gives s  =  1,g  =  14, contradicting the hypotheses.

Let the situation be as above with d  =  g - s, s  ≥   - 1 and

[formula]

If S does not contain a ( - 2)-curve, then C is of maximal Clifford index [formula].

Note that a stronger form of this has been proved for s  =   - 2 and g odd in [\cite=fo] and for s  =   - 1 and g even in [\cite=fo]. The proof follows closely that of [\cite=f], but, since some of the estimates are delicate and our hypotheses differ, we give full details.

Since C is ample by Lemma [\ref=lem2.3], it follows from [\cite=cp] that C is of Clifford dimension 1.

Suppose that [formula]. According to [\cite=dm] there is an effective divisor D on S such that D|C computes γ1(C) and satisfying

[formula]

We consider the exact cohomology sequence

[formula]

Since C - D is effective, and not equivalent to zero, we get

[formula]

By assumption S does not contain ( - 2)-curves, so |D - C| has no fixed components. According to Proposition [\ref=prop2.2] the equation (C - D)2  =  0 has no solutions, therefore (C - D)2 > 0 and the general element of |C - D| is smooth and irreducible. It follows that

[formula]

and

[formula]

by Riemann-Roch. We shall prove that

[formula]

a contradiction.

Let D  ~  mH  +  nC with [formula]. Since D is effective and S contains no ( - 2)-curves, we have D2  >  0 and D  ·  H  >  2. Since C - D is also effective, we have (C - D)  ·  H  >  2, i.e. D  ·  H  <  d  -  2. These inequalities and deg (D|C)  ≤  g - 1 translate to the following inequalities

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Consider the function

[formula]

and denote by

[formula]

the solutions of the equation 6x2  -  2dx  +  2g - 2  =  0. Note that d2  >  12(g - 1). So a and b are positive real numbers.

Suppose first that n  <  0. From [\eqref=eq3.1] we have either m  <   - bn or m  >   - an. If m  <   - bn, then [\eqref=eq3.2] implies that 2  <  n(d - 6b)  <  0, because n  <  0 and [formula], which gives a contradiction.

If n  <  0 and m  >   - an, from [\eqref=eq3.3] we get

[formula]

since d2  >  12(g - 1). For a fixed n, f(m,n) is increasing as a function of m for [formula] and therefore

[formula]

which gives a contradiction. Here the last inequality reduces to

[formula]

which certainly holds if d2  ≥  15g - 3. This is true under our hypotheses on g if s  ≥  1. The inequality can be checked directly in the cases s  =  0 and s  =   - 1.

Now suppose n  >  0. From [\eqref=eq3.1] we get that either m  <   - an or m  >   - bn. If m  <   - an, we get from [\eqref=eq3.2], 2  <  n( - 6a + d)  <  0, a contradiction.

When m  >   - bn, first suppose n  =  1. Then [\eqref=eq3.3] gives

[formula]

We claim that

[formula]

In terms of s we have

[formula]

since s  ≥   - 1. This gives 1  <  b. For the second inequality note that [formula] gives [formula] and b is a strictly increasing function of s in the interval [formula]. Since certainly [formula], we obtain [formula].

So there are no solutions of [\eqref=eq3.4] unless d  ≥  g - 1, i.e. s  =  1,0 or - 1. For these values of s we must have m  =   - 1 and

[formula]

So [formula] if and only if g  ≥  2s  +  14.

Now suppose m  >   - bn and n  ≥  2. Then [\eqref=eq3.3] gives

[formula]

We have

[formula]

It is easy to see that [formula] for n  ≥  2. Moreover,

[formula]

Note that

[formula]

So f( - bn,n) is a strictly increasing function of n. Hence it suffices to show that [formula] or equivalently

[formula]

According to [\eqref=eq3.5] we have [formula]. So, since d  ≤  g + 1, we have

[formula]

This completes the argument for m  >   - bn,  n  >  0.

Finally, suppose n = 0. Then

[formula]

As a function of m this takes its maximum value at [formula]. By [\eqref=eq3.3], [formula]. So f(m,0) takes its minimal value in the allowable range at m = 1. Since f(1,0)  =  d - 8, we require [formula] or equivalently

[formula]

which is valid by hypothesis.

This completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm1.2].

For s  =  0 or - 1 the assumptions of the theorem are best possible, since in these cases γ(H|C)  =  γ((C - H)|C)  =  d - 8 would otherwise be less than [formula]. For s  ≥  1 the conditions can be relaxed. For example, if s  ≥  1 and g  =  4s  +  12, the only places where the argument can fail are in the proofs of Lemma [\ref=lem2.1] and formula [\eqref=eq3.5]. In the first case, one can show directly that d2 - 6(2g - 2) is not a perfect square; in the second, one can show that [formula], which is sufficient.

The condition that S does not contain a ( - 2)-curve certainly holds if 3m2 + dmn  +  (g - 1)n2  =   - 1 has no solutions. We do not know precisely when this is true, but it certainly holds if both g - 1 and g  -  s are divisible by 3. So the conclusion of Theorem [\ref=thm2.4] holds for [formula], if g  ≥  4s  +  14 and [formula]. The conclusion also holds, for example, for g = 16 and s  =  1 (see Remark [\ref=rem2.5]).

Proof of Theorem 1.1

Let C and H be as in Proposition [\ref=prop2.2] with d  =  g - s,s  ≥   - 1 and suppose that S has no ( - 2)-curves. Then H|C is a generated line bundle on C with h0(OC(H|C))  =  5 and

[formula]

is not injective.

Consider the exact sequence

[formula]

H - C is not effective, since (H - C)  ·  H  =  6 - d  <  0. So we have

[formula]

Now

[formula]

and

[formula]

So by Riemann-Roch h0(OS(C - H))  ≥  3. Since S has no ( - 2)-curves, it follows that the linear system |C - H| has no fixed components and hence its general element is smooth and irreducible (see [\cite=sd]). Hence h1(OS(H - C))  =  0 and therefore h0(OC(H|C))  =  h0(OS(H)) = 5. The last assertion follows from the fact that S is contained in a quadric.

Lemma [\ref=lem3.1] implies that H|C belongs to W4g - s. So g - s  ≥  d4. Since the generic value of d4 is [formula], it follows that C has non-generic d4 if g  <  5s  +  20.

Let C be a smooth irreducible curve and M a generated line bundle on C of degree d  <  2d1 with h0(M)  =  5 and such that S2H0(M)  →  H0(M2) is not injective. Then [formula].

The proof is identical with that of [\cite=gmn]. [formula]

Let C be as in Theorem [\ref=thm2.4]. Then

[formula];

[formula].

This follows from Theorem [\ref=thm2.4] and Lemmas [\ref=lem3.1] and [\ref=lem3.3].

This completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm1.1], where the last assertion follows from Remark [\ref=rem2.6].

γ'2n(C)  <  γ1(C) for every positive integer n.

This follows from Theorem [\ref=thm3.4] and [\cite=ln].

Under the conditions of Theorem [\ref=thm1.1], for any stable bundle E of rank 2 and degree g - s on C with h0(E)  =  4, it follows from [\cite=gmn] that the coherent system (E,H0(E)) is α-stable for all α  >  0. So the corresponding moduli spaces of coherent systems are non-empty.
