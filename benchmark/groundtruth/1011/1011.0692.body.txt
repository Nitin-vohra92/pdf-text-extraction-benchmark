IPPP/10/89; DCPT/10/178 Spectroscopic Bounds on New Physics

Introduction

We use atomic spectroscopy of ordinary and exotic atoms to test Coulomb's law with high precision on atomic length scales [\cite=Popovontheexp] [\cite=Karshenboim:2010cg] [\cite=Karshenboim:2010ck]. This in turn allows us to constrain new particles such as hidden photons [\cite=Popovontheexp] [\cite=Okun] [\cite=Pospelov:2008zw] which arise naturally in a variety of extensions of the standard model [\cite=Okun] [\cite=Holdom] [\cite=Dienes1997104] [\cite=Abel:2003ue] [\cite=Abel:2006qt] [\cite=Abel:2008ai] [\cite=Goodsell:2009xc] (see also [\cite=Jaeckel:2010ni] for a review).

Hidden photons cause a deviation from Coulomb's law,

[formula]

where [formula] is the mass of the hidden photon and χ is the kinetic mixing [\cite=Holdom]. Note that independent of the particle interpretation, our bounds can more generally constrain deviations from Coulomb's law by a Yukawa type potential.

In the small and large mass limits we recover the original [formula] form potential. It is only in the intermediate mass regions that we expect to see measurable deviations to Coulomb's Law. Hence we expect our bounds to drop off at low and high energies.

Spectroscopic bounds

We adapt the method presented in Ref. [\cite=Gluck:2007ia], where the Lamb shift in atomic hydrogen is used to bound minicharged particles.

At first order in perturbation theory the energy shift of a state |ψn〉 is given by

[formula]

We then impose that δE(1)n must be smaller than the uncertainty in the transition. This constrains δV.

We find that a naive application of this method fails. Transitions between states with different values of the principal quantum number n do not exhibit the correct drop off for small masses. For example the naive 1s1 / 2  -  2s1 / 2 bound from atomic hydrogen is plotted as the dotted red curve in Fig. [\ref=condensed]. We can understand the physical reasoning for this from Eq. [\eqref=Vintro]. At small masses our perturbation reduces to a term that has the form of a Coulomb potential, but with an extra factor (1 + χ2), which we have not absorbed into α. In other words we have forgotten to properly (re-)normalise the coupling α. We do this by treating α as a unknown instead of a constant, and using a second transition to solve for it. We can then produce properly renormalised bounds which are functions of two transitions and not one. Fig. [\ref=condensed] shows a correctly renormalised bound (thin, joined, green) using 1s1 / 2  -  2s1 / 2 and 2s1 / 2  -  8s1 / 2 transitions in atomic hydrogen.

Note that Lamb shift bounds renormalise trivially and can therefore be formed using only one measurement (see [\cite=Jaeckel:2010xx]). The 2s1 / 2  -  2p1 / 2 bound from atomic hydrogen is the thick blue joined curve in [\ref=condensed]. The bound drops off correctly for small masses.

Other transitions involving higher excited states in atomic hydrogen are considered. However these do not form good bounds, mainly due to high experimental uncertainties (see [\cite=Jaeckel:2010xx]).

We then apply the method to other atomic systems. The idea is that other atomic systems may have advantages over atomic hydrogen. For example in pure QED systems like muonium and positronium, we can assume a point-like nucleus [\cite=Jungmann:2004sa]. This eliminates large uncertainties from finite nuclear size effects. Smaller uncertainties strengthen our bounds, as can be seen from Eq. ([\ref=1st_order]).

However in many cases theoretical uncertainties are larger. For example hadronic orbiting particles also interact with the nucleus via the strong interaction, which causes huge theoretical and experimental uncertainties (see [\cite=Jaeckel:2010xx]).

Also many of these atoms have larger reduced masses or smaller Bohr radii than atomic hydrogen, shifting our bounds to higher masses and towards the unexplored region.

All relevant transitions in hydrogen-like atoms were examined to see whether the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. We found overall that we could not improve upon our original atomic hydrogen bounds using existing data.

Our best bounds (the light green and thick dark blue lines in Fig. [\ref=condensed]) do not penetrate new parameter space for hidden photons. However they do improve upon previous Coulomb's law tests (brown region in [\ref=condensed]) in the sense that they extend the excluded region to higher masses. This is a non-trivial improvement as Coulomb based bounds are especially clean and model independent [\cite=Jaeckel:2010xx] [\cite=Karshenboim:2010cg] [\cite=Karshenboim:2010ck]. For example fixed target bounds assume a 100 % branching ratio for hidden photons to decay into charged standard model particles. If this assumption is wrong, then the bounds are weakened or possibly invalidated (see [\cite=Jaeckel:2010xx]).

Finally we investigate the discovery potential of future experiments.

For example, a recent article suggests that true muonium (μ+ μ-) could be produced and studied in the near future. The reduced mass is ~   100 times greater than atomic hydrogen, and for a pure QED system we expect small theoretical errors. Since no experimental data is available, we produce a speculative bound using an estimate of the theoretical error (lower dashed, black in Fig. [\ref=condensed]). This penetrates new parameter space, but one still needs to obtain a coherent experimental result.

The reduced mass of muonic atoms are ~   200 times larger than atomic hydrogen. In references [\cite=Eides:2000xc] [\cite=PhysRevA.53.2092] [\cite=PhysRevA.60.3593] [\cite=PhysRevA.71.032508] [\cite=PhysRevA.71.022506] [\cite=hypfinesplit] [\cite=citeulike:7426442] the 2sF = 11 / 2  -  2pF = 23 / 2 difference in muonic hydrogen is calculated as a function or the proton radius rp . If we substitute in the most precise current value of rp  =  0.8768(69) fm, from atomic spectra [\cite=mohr-2007], we obtain Eth  =   - 205.984(062) meV. The theoretical uncertainty alone is quite high. Moreover this also deviates from the recently measured experimental value of - 206.295000(3) meV [\cite=citeulike:7426442] by around 5σ. This discrepancy is bad for producing bounds, but could be taken as a potential signal for new physics. We considered if the hidden photon could be used to explain this anomaly [\cite=falkowskidark]. However this is ruled out by Lamb shift measurements in atomic hydrogen (see [\cite=Jaeckel:2010xx]).

However we can form a speculative bound (upper dashed, purple in Fig. [\ref=condensed]) from just experimental uncertainty. This bound penetrates new parameter space. If an independent and sufficiently precise value of rp could be determined - consistent with the muonic hydrogen extraction - this speculative bound could be turned into a real one.

Conclusion

We have used atomic spectroscopy of ordinary and exotic atoms to constrain deviations from Coulomb's law. A fully renormalised method was developed, which provides correctly shaped constraints for high and low masses. We interpreted these constraints as bounds on hidden photons and found that pure Coulomb bounds were extended to higher masses. This is a non-trivial improvement as Coulomb based bounds are especially clean and model-independent, and provide complementary information to existing ones, which are often more model dependent. We also find that new parameter space for hidden photons could be penetrated using future data from exotic atoms.
