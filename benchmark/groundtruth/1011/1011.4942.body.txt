Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay in Particle Physics

Introduction

Neutrinoless double beta decay (0) experiments [\cite=exp] are much more than neutrino experiments. Searches for 0νββ are fundamental physics because they probe the presence of lepton number violation, which is on equal footing to baryon number violation, i.e. proton decay. Once a (positive or negative) result from 0νββ experiments is present, one can go on and (assuming that lepton number is violated in Nature) interpret the outcome in two ways:

Standard Interpretation:

neutrinoless double beta decay is mediated by light, active and massive Majorana neutrinos (the ones which oscillate) and all other mechanisms potentially leading to 0νββ give negligible or no contribution;

Non-Standard Interpretations:

neutrinoless double beta decay is mediated by some other lepton number violating process, and light, active and massive Majorana neutrinos (the ones which oscillate) potentially leading to 0νββ give negligible or no contribution.

In the first interpretation 0νββ is a neutrino physics experiment, in the second one a broader particle physics experiment with emphasis on the particular lepton number violating physics under study. Of course, the observation of 0νββ implies the Majorana nature of neutrinos (to be precise, a tiny 4-loop induced Majorana mass term), a fact known as the black-box, or Schechter-Valle, theorem [\cite=Schechter:1980gr]. We will discuss in this contribution some of the physics potential of the two interpretations given above. For experimental aspects, see the contributions in [\cite=exp], nuclear physics issues are dealt with in [\cite=nme].

Standard Interpretation

The first interpretation is most common, and in the light of neutrino oscillations arguably the best motivated one. Assuming light massive Majorana neutrino exchange, the amplitude for 0νββ is proportional to

[formula]

Here q2≃(0.1 ~ GeV)2 is the typical momentum exchange in the reaction, mi are the neutrino masses, |Uei| the PMNS matrix elements of the first row (depending on θ12 and θ13) and α,β are the two Majorana phases. The coherent sum 〈mee〉 is usually called the effective mass and contains 7 of 9 parameters of the neutrino mass matrix, which in the fundamental Lagrangian fully describes neutrino mass and lepton mixing. Two of those 9 parameters, the Majorana phases, show up only in the effective mass. It contains therefore a large amount of information. Its geometrical interpretation is shown in the left part of Fig. [\ref=fig:triangle]: if the three complex terms in [formula] cannot form a triangle, the effective mass is non-zero. Fig. [\ref=fig:triangle] also displays plots of the effective mass versus the other two complementary mass observables. Those are

[formula]

measurable in beta decays [\cite=katrin] and in cosmology [\cite=cosmo], respectively. We refer to the cited contributions presented at this conference for their current status and future prospects.

What is noteworthy from the plots of neutrino mass observables is that the effective mass can vanish in case of the normal neutrino mass ordering. While it seems at first sight unnatural that 7 parameters conspire in order to let a particular combination of them become zero, it should be kept in mind that 〈mee〉 is the ee element of the fundamental low energy Majorana neutrino mass matrix. This matrix is generated by the underlying theory of mass generation, and texture zeros occur frequently in such (flavor) models. We recall here that the dependence on 〈mee〉 of the amplitude is in fact stemming from the term [formula], and the limit q2  ≫  m2i is taken in the fermion propagator to obtain Eq. ([\ref=eq:ALNE]). If [formula], then there is a term of order U2ei  m3i / q4, which will in general not vanish. It is however suppressed by a factor [formula].

In contrast to the normal ordering, the effective mass cannot vanish for the inverted mass ordering. The lower limit of 〈mee〉 can be expressed as

[formula]

If the inverted ordering is to be ruled out, limits below IH min have to be reached. Among the parameters governing IH min the largest dependence is induced by the solar neutrino parameter sin 2θ12, and quantifies to an uncertainty of about a factor of 2 for IH min. This factor of 2 introduces therefore about the same uncertainty as the nuclear matrix elements (NMEs), and motivates solar neutrino precision experiments in order to reduce it.

The three types of neutrino mass observables are obviously highly complementary. Ordinary beta decay is basically a model-independent probe of neutrino mass, whereas the extraction of the cosmological observable [formula] is sensitive to the data sets used, and little is known what happens to limits when non-standard cosmological models different from the ΛCDM framework are applied. As mentioned above, neutrino mass limits from 0νββ require the assumption of lepton number violation and in addition, as we will see below, that no other mechanism contributes.

At the end of this decade, mβ will be known to be larger or smaller than about 0.3 eV, standard cosmology will be sensitive to smaller values of [formula], while 〈mee〉 can also be probed down to the 0.1 eV regime. All three observables are therefore expected to be tested at similar levels, and the complementarity of the different approaches to neutrino mass opens up exciting possibilities. The interplay of the observables is studied in detail e.g. in Refs. [\cite=Feruglio:2002af] [\cite=deGouvea:2005hj] [\cite=Lindner:2005kr] [\cite=Pascoli:2007qh] [\cite=Fogli:2008ig]. The ideal case would arise when positive signals in all three measurements were found. Using the foreseen experimental uncertainties (and theoretical uncertainties, i.e. the NMEs) one can estimate how precisely the neutrino mass scale could be pinned down [\cite=Pascoli:2005zb] [\cite=Maneschg:2008sf]. The following analysis, taken from Ref. [\cite=Maneschg:2008sf] (similar results can be found in [\cite=Pascoli:2005zb]), assumes quasi-degenerate neutrinos with a true value of the neutrino mass of m3  =  0.3 eV (hence mβ  =  0.3 eV and [formula] eV) and experimental errors as specified in publications of the respective collaborations. The remaining free parameter is called ζ  ≥  0 and quantifies the uncertainty introduced by our ignorance about the NMEs in the extraction of 〈mee〉 from a lifetime measurement. Without any NME uncertainty we could determine m3 at 3σ to about 15 %, while ζ  =  0.25 would make this possible to 25 %. Leaving [formula] out of the analysis would lead to an error of 50 % on m3 if ζ  =  0.25, which illustrates that the precision is largely from the determination of [formula]. This is all illustrated in Fig. [\ref=fig:stat], which displays the reconstructible 1, 2 and 3σ contours in the parameter space of m3 and the measured effective mass  exp. Another aspect of mass-related observables is the potential to rule out some of the many models which have been proposed to explain lepton mixing. Very often flavor symmetry models generate neutrino mass sum-rules (see e.g. [\cite=mod]) and thereby generate relations between the observables that are different from the general case (Fig. [\ref=fig:triangle]) and therefore only certain regions in parameter space are allowed. Fig. [\ref=fig:sr], taken from Ref. [\cite=Barry:2010yk], shows the result for four sum-rules.

Before turning to non-standard interpretations, i.e. mechanism of double beta decay not directly connected to 3 neutrino oscillations, let us mention an "intermediate case": if light sterile neutrinos exist, which could be suggested by interpretations of the LSND/MiniBooNE experiments (see [\cite=st] for their current status), then there are eV scale sterile neutrinos with mixing angles of order 0.1. Hence, their contribution to the effective mass [\cite=sruba] is at least of order 0.01 eV, i.e. of the same order as for the inverted hierarchy.

Non-Standard Interpretations

A clear experimental signature for a non-standard contribution to 0νββ would be for instance no signal in KATRIN and/or cosmology, and a life-time measurement in 0νββ which would be interpreted as an effective mass of 0.5 eV or so. There are several candidates for non-standard contributions: Higgs triplets, right-handed currents, heavy Majorana neutrinos, supersymmetric particles, etc. Limits from 0νββ can be translated into limits on the couplings and masses associated with these mechanisms. The limits from the literature, which often take nuclear physics aspects into account, can be approximately reproduced by rather simple arguments on the amplitude level. For instance, heavy Majorana neutrinos (for which in the propagator the limit M2i  ≫  q2 applies) will have an amplitude proportional to [formula], where Mi are heavy neutrino masses with coupling Sei to electrons. Setting this amplitude equal to the light neutrino amplitude from Eq. ([\ref=eq:ALNE]), and using [formula] eV gives [formula] GeV- 1, which is in fact the limit given in [\cite=KlapdorKleingrothaus:1999kq]. (Left-handed) Higgs triplet exchange has an amplitude [formula], where hee is its coupling to two electrons, vL its vev, and MΔ  ≫  q its mass. Note that heevL is the contribution of the triplet to neutrino mass. Therefore, if the triplet would be responsible for neutrino mass, its contribution to 0νββ would be suppressed by a factor q2 / M2Δ. On the other hand, the triplet can only give the leading contribution to 0νββ if 〈mee〉 is extremely small.

R-parity violating SUSY can also mediate the process (see e.g. [\cite=Mohapatra:1986su] [\cite=Hirsch:1995ek]), in two classes of diagrams. First, in the usual diagram of 0νββ the W bosons can essentially be replaced by selectrons and the Majorana neutrino by a neutralino or gaugino. The amplitude is then given by [formula], where [formula] is a (combination of) gauge coupling(s), λ'111 stems from the vertex of the selectron with the up- and down quarks and the power of ΛSUSY is easily understood by the propagators for one fermion and two bosons, whose masses are assumed to be ΛSUSY  ≫  q. By comparing again with the amplitude in Eq. ([\ref=eq:ALNE]), it follows [formula] GeV- 5, to be compared with the literature value of 3  ×  10- 17 GeV- 5 [\cite=Hirsch:1995ek]. Interestingly, the same couplings describe resonant selectron production at the LHC [\cite=Allanach:2009iv], which allows to test this mechanism. For instance, one can show that certain regions in SUSY parameter space are in conflict with existing 0νββ-limits, or that detection of resonant selectron production at the LHC in other regions would rule out any considerable contribution of this mechanism to 0νββ [\cite=Allanach:2009iv]. Another class of R-parity violating diagrams involves neutrino and virtual squark exchange. The amplitude goes as [formula], where mdk is the down-type quark mass of the kth generation. It enters the game because mixing between left- and right-handed squarks is involved, which is proportional to this mass. The λ'121  λ'112 term is irrelevant due to K0-q0 constraints, and the λ'111  λ'111 contribution is sub-leading with respect to the diagram discussed above [\cite=Allanach:2009xx]. Anyway, depending on whether it is the down-, strange- or bottom (s)quark, by comparing the amplitudes limits of (1  ×  10- 11, 6  ×  10- 13 or 1  ×  10- 14) GeV- 3 arise, compared with the actual literature values of (7.7  ×  10- 12, 4.0  ×  10- 13 or 1.7  ×  10- 14) GeV- 3 [\cite=Faessler:2007nz]. Again, the simple estimates are rather close to the limits involving nuclear physics.

However, there is nuclear physics, and in fact it can help to distinguish the different mechanisms. This has been dealt with recently in Refs. [\cite=Gehman:2007qg] [\cite=Deppisch:2006hb] [\cite=Fogli:2009py]. For instance, one can within a typical NME calculation fix the particle physics parameters such that for 76Ge the life-time is the same for all popular non-standard mechanisms. Triggered by nuclear details, the life-time in other nuclei can however differ by up to one order of magnitude. Typically, multi-isotope determination of 0νββ in three to four different elements is necessary in order to single out the true mechanism [\cite=Gehman:2007qg].

We have seen up to know that non-standard mechanisms can be pinned down either by looking for other places in which they show their presence, or by probing 0νββ in different nuclei. The third possibility is to take a closer look at the decay products, namely the two final state electrons. The SuperNEMO experiment is currently the only one able to probe in particular the energy of the individual electrons and their angular distribution [\cite=Arnold:2010tu]. A recent analysis by the collaboration assumes the simultaneous presence of the standard mechanism (with the particle physics parameter 〈mee〉) and a right-handed current contribution (λ  =  (mW / mWR)2  Uei  Vei, with V being the right-handed analogon of the PMNS matrix). Fig. [\ref=fig:sn] shows an example of the results from [\cite=Arnold:2010tu].

Summary

Neutrinoless double beta decay will be intensively searched for in the current decade. The interesting complementarity with the other neutrino mass-related observables can shed some light on the question of neutrino mass generation and on the cosmological model. Perhaps even more interesting is the possibility of other mechanisms leading to 0νββ, which have phenomenological consequences in a variety of fields, such as lepton flavor violation or accelerator physics.
