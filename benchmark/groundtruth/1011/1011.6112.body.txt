Knotted surfaces and equivalencies of their diagrams without triple points

Introduction

Let F denotes a closed surface, the image of an embedding [formula] is called the knotted surface, with F being the based surface for f. Sometimes to emphesize that the based surface may not be connected, instead of a knotted surface we say a linked surface. For simplicity it is often used F to denote f(F).

Two knotted surfaces are equivalent if there exists an orientation preserving autohomeomorphism of [formula], taking one surface to the other.

We say that a diagram DF is a p-diagram if it does not contain a triple point, that is for all x∈DF we have [formula]. Two p-diagrams DF and DF' are p-equivalent if there exists a finite sequence of p-diagrams [formula] such that for all [formula] a transition from Di to Di + 1 is one of four Roseman moves that involve only p-diagrams (or some isotopy of that diagram in [formula]).

Above mention four moves can be (of course) realized by an isotopy of a surface in [formula] without introducing a triple point in the projection. It is natural then to consider the following problem.

Similar question but for branch points instead of triple points in our definition of p-diagram, was answered by S. Satoh in [\cite=Sat01b]. In this paper we introduce an invariant of p-equivalent diagrams, that helps to answer our question as follows.

There exist two p-diagrams of equivalent surfaces that are not p-equivalent.

Preliminaries

Let us fix a projection [formula] by π((x,y,z,t)) = (x,y,z). A double decker set Γ is the closure in F of a set [formula], and the double point set is the image π(Γ) which we will denote by Γ*. We say that the π(F) also denote by F* is in a general position if the double point set consists of points whose neighborhood is locally homeomorphic to:

two transversely intersecting sheets,

three transversely intersecting sheets,

the Whitney'a umbrella.

Points corresponding to these cases (i), (ii), (iii) in the Figure [\ref=r31] are called a double point, a triple point and a branch point respectively.

Every knotted surface is equivalent (and is placed arbitrarily near) to a knotted surface whose projection is in a general position.

We can therefore from now on assume a general position of a projection image.

A diagram DK of a knotted surface K is the image π(K) with additional information at self crossing, about which sheet was higher before being projected.

We have the following well known characterization of the equivalency between knotted surfaces.

Two diagrams represent equivalent linked surfaces if and only if one of them may be achieved from the other by a finite sequence of elementary local moves taken from the list in the Figure [\ref=r43] (and some isotopy of the diagram in [formula]).

For the simplicity, in pictures of those Rosemann moves we do not indicate which sheet is an upper sheet.

Let [formula] be an oriented linked surface such that the diagram DF is a p-diagram. Define Af as a set of those circles c  ⊂  Γ, that the set [formula] has nonempty intersection with two distinct components of the surface F.

On each circle in the set Af let us give an orientation defined as follows and depicted in Figure [\ref=moje3].

Let G*1 and G*2 be sheets in F*, intersecting each other in a double point curve c*. Let c1  ⊂  G1 and c2  ⊂  G2 be curves on the double decker set, that are projection preimages of the curve c*  ⊂  Γ*. Let [formula] and [formula] be normal vectors to G*1 and G*2 respectively. Then the orientation of the vector [formula] on c1 is defined through the condition, that a triple [formula] matches the orientation given to [formula]. By analogy we can define the orientation of [formula] on c2.

We will also need to distinguish between two kinds of surface regions.

A set [formula] may be checkerboard coloured, i.e. we can colour each component with one of two colours 0 or 1, such that adjacent (by common boundary edge) regions have different colours.

We can deduce from this lemma a usefull fact involving our special set of circles.

A set [formula] may be checkerboard coloured, because we can colour one by one regions on each component of F, treating them as disjont surface knots.

Let us colour then our set [formula] in (one of two) fixed checkerboard. Finally we will need one more definition to distinguish between two types of elements from the set Af.

Define a set   ⊂  Af consisting of those circles d, that lies on the regions of the colour 1 and lies higher (with respect to the projection axis) than its mate circle [formula].

We are now ready to intruduce our mention invariant.

A class

[formula]

is an invariant of p-diagrams with respect to the p-equivalence of the oriented linked surface F.

Proofs of theorems

We will proceed by checking all four elementary moves that involve p-diagrams.

For Roseman moves I and II conclusion of the theorem is satisfied, because both positions and colours of the regions surrounding curves from the set Af does not change as they projection images do not take part in those moves. In case of the move III we are in the situation of appearing and disappearing of a pair of circles on the double decker set. If those circles do not belong to the set Af then we give the same argument as in the case of previous moves. But if those circles belong to the set Af then because their homology class as 1-chain is zero, our invariant does not change.

More interesting is the last tranformation. In case of the move IV, presented in Figure [\ref=r43] we can notice that all (involve in this move) curves from double decker set belong either to circles from the set Af or the are subsets of circles from outside Af (both before and after triansformation). If it is the latter case, we give argument as in the move II case. Otherwise, we conclude that curves from double decker set (in this local area that we are going to deform) which lies "higher" with respect to the projection direction lies both on the region with the same colour. Moreover this situation does not change after doing this move. Homology class of 1-chain (with our defined orientation) on which corresponding "lower" curves lies, does not change (because of the group additivity) which ends the proof.

Let us consider two diagrams DF and DF' defined by a series of movie stills shown in the Figure [\ref=moje2].

They represent p-diagrams, because we do not make the Reidemeister third move in any transition between stills. Only such elementary move would produce a triple point in the diagram. Our diagrams give rise to knotted surfaces F and F' that are equivalent. This can be shown for example by applying a combination of another set of moves to the stills. Such movie moves are described by Carter and Saito in their book [\cite=CarSai98]. However, p-diagrams DF and DF' are not p-equivalent. From the Figure [\ref=moje1] of a base surface for F with a double decker set drawn, we can conclude that our invariant for the DF case gives nontrivial class (of one of those circles depicted on the torus) in the oposite to the case of diagram DF' for which the double decker set is empty.
