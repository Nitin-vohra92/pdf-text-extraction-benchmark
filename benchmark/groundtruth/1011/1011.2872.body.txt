Introduction

By a site percolation on [formula], we mean an [formula]-valued random object X. Focus in percolation theory is mainly on the connected components (clusters) of X. Two vertices [formula] are said to communicate if there exists a path [formula] from z1 = x to zn = y with [formula] (in the definition of path, we require zi and zj to be L1-nearest neighbors for each i), and a connected component is a maximal set of vertices that all communicate with each other. A connected component is called an open cluster or a closed cluster depending on whether its vertices take value 1 or 0 in X.

Much of percolation theory deals with the i.i.d. case (see, e.g., Grimmett [\cite=G]), though various dependent settings have also received much attention. Here we will abandon the i.i.d. assumption in favor of the weaker but natural assumption of translation invariance, meaning that for any n and any [formula], the distribution of [formula] does not depend on [formula].

Intuitively, the planar structure of [formula] makes it difficult for an infinite open cluster and an infinite closed cluster to coexist. In order to prove a theorem to this extent, some further conditions beyond translation invariance are needed, as the following trivial example shows: assign the vertices on the x-axis independently value 0 or 1 with probability [formula] each, and let the values of any other vertex z be dictated by the value of the vertex on the x-axis sharing z's x-coordinate. This produces a translation invariant site percolation with both infinite open clusters and infinite closed clusters (in fact, infinitely many of each).

In a seminal paper, Gandolfi, Keane and Russo [\cite=GKR] showed that translation invariance and positive associations together with some auxiliary ergodicity conditions (later relaxed by Sheffield [\cite=Sh]) is enough to rule out such coexistence. In applications of this result, the hard part has typically been to establish positive associations; see for instance Chayes [\cite=C] and Häggström [\cite=H]. Partly for this reason, several researchers over the years have asked whether the positive associations condition can be replaced by the often easier-to-verify condition of finite energy, defined as follows.

A site percolation X on [formula] is said to satisfy finite energy if it admits conditional probabilities such that for all [formula] and all [formula] we have

[formula]

It is said to satisfy uniform finite energy if for some ε > 0 it admits conditional probabilities such that for all [formula] and all [formula] we have

[formula]

In this paper, we show by means of concrete examples that translation invariance together with finite energy is not sufficient to rule out coexistence of an infinite open cluster, and an infinite closed cluster. What's more, it does not even help if we replace finite energy by uniform finite energy:

There exists a translation invariant site percolation on [formula] that satisfies uniform finite energy and that produces a.s. an infinite open cluster and an infinite closed cluster.

It is a classical result of Burton and Keane [\cite=BK] that translation invariance and finite energy together are enough to rule out the existence of more than one infinite open cluster (and, by symmetry, more than one infinite closed cluster), so any example witnessing Theorem [\ref=thm:main] must have a.s. exactly one infinite cluster of each kind.

The rest of this paper is devoted to examples exhibiting such coexistence. The example witnessing Theorem [\ref=thm:main] requires a somewhat elaborate construction, and is therefore postponed to Section [\ref=sect:second]. Along the way, we answer affirmatively (in Theorem [\ref=thm:two_big_clusters]) the question of whether, still assuming translation invariance, coexistence is possible between an infinite open cluster and an infinite closed cluster that are both robust under i.i.d. thinning. Before that, and in order to offer the reader some intuition for the problem, we first present a slightly less involved construction in Section [\ref=sect:first], which satisfies finite energy but not uniform finite energy.

First construction

The purpose of this section is to give an example which proves the following weaker version of Theorem [\ref=thm:main].

There exists a translation invariant site percolation on [formula] that satisfies finite energy and that produces a.s. an infinite open cluster and an infinite closed cluster.

The construction will be based on the notion of a uniform spanning tree for the [formula] lattice, first studied by Pemantle [\cite=Pem] and later by Benjamini et al. [\cite=BLPS] and others.

A spanning tree of a connected graph G = (V,E) is a connected subgraph of G that contains all vertices v∈V but no cycles. Any finite such G has a finite number of possible spanning trees, and a uniform spanning tree for G is therefore elementary to define in this finite setting: it is the random spanning tree for G obtained by choosing one of the possible spanning trees at random according to uniform distribution. This procedure may be identified with a probability measure μ on {0,1}E which we call the uniform spanning tree measure for G.

If we now move on to the case where G = (V,E) is infinite but locally finite, the concept of a uniform spanning tree is less elementary, because there may be infinitely many (even uncountably many) possible spanning trees. Pemantle [\cite=Pem] showed that the following natural definition makes sense. By an exhaustion of G, we mean a sequence [formula] of connected finite subgraphs that exhausts G in the sense that every v∈V and every e∈E is contained in all but at most finitely many Gi's. For each Gi we know how to pick a uniform spanning tree, so we may define a probability measure μi on {0,1}E whose projection on {0,1}Ei is the uniform spanning tree measure for Gi while the projection on [formula] may be defined arbitrarily. It turns out (see [\cite=Pem]) that the μi's converge (in the product topology) to a limiting measure μ on {0,1}E. Furthermore μ is concentrated on subgraphs of G consisting of a union of finitely or infinitely many infinite trees (i.e., not necessarily a single tree as might be tempting to believe). Pemantle considered the case where G is the [formula] lattice - having vertex set [formula] and edge set E consisting of edges connecting L1-nearest neighbors - and showed that the number of trees is a μ-a.s. constant, equalling 1 for d  ≤  4, and ∞   for d  ≥  5. The case which concerns us is d = 2, where the resulting spanning tree, other than being unique, also has the following interesting properties:

Using Pemantle's spanning tree construction Y, we construct a site percolation [formula] as follows; it should be viewed as a picture of Y and [formula] scaled up by factor 2. Writing [formula] in terms of its coordinates as x = (x1,x2)

[formula]

The remaining sites respresent crossing pairs of edges in E and Ẽ: a 1 indicates the presence of e∈E and a 0 that of its dual edge ẽ. More precisely, if x1 is even and x2 is odd, we set X(x1,x2) = 1 iff the edge e∈E linking [formula] to [formula] is present in Y; while if x1 is odd and x2 is even, we set X(x1,x2) = 1 iff the edge e∈E linking [formula] to [formula] is present in Y.

This defines [formula]. It is clear from the construction that X produces a.s. a single infinite open cluster, a single infinite closed cluster, and no finite clusters. To serve as a couterexample proving Proposition [\ref=prop:finite_energy], it is however deficient in two ways, as (i) it fails to be translation invariant, and (ii) it fails to exhibit finite energy. Translation invariance is fixed by letting X̂∈{0,1}Z2 equal X shifted by a random amount equalling (0,0), (0,1), (1,0) or (1,1), each with probability [formula]; the resulting site percolation X̂ is easily seen to be translation invariant.

To modify it again to give it finite energy, note first that for each [formula] which is open in X̂ there is a unique infinite self-avoiding open path in [formula] starting at x and using only open vertices, and analogously for each closed [formula]. Thus, each [formula] has the following property: removing x would cut off a finite (possibly 0) number of vertices from either the infinite open or the infinite closed cluster of X̂. Write b(x) for this number, and construct [formula] by letting

[formula]

independently for each [formula]. This defines X̄, which clearly satisfies finite energy. Furthermore, if x is a site which is open in X̂, then the expected number of sites in the unique infinite self-avoiding path from x in X̂ that flip in the mapping ([\ref=eq:perturbation]) is bounded by [formula] and therefore finite. So we have a.s. that for some vertex in the path and onwards, no vertex is flipped. Hence X̄ has an infinite open cluster. Similarly we get that it has an infinite closed cluster. Thus, it has all the properties needed to warrant the statement that Proposition [\ref=prop:finite_energy] is established.

Second construction

Most of the work needed to prove Theorem [\ref=thm:main] is contained in the proof of the following Theorem [\ref=thm:two_big_clusters]. We will need some additional standard terminology. For an infinite but locally finite graph G, define the site percolation critical value pc,site(G) to be the infimum over all p∈[0,1] such that i.i.d. site percolation on G with retention parameter p produces a.s. at least one infinite open cluster. Also, let pc,bond(G) be the analogous critical value for i.i.d. bond percolation on G, i.e., for the percolation process where it is the edges (rather than the vertices) that are removed at random. The following result is well known; see, e.g., [\cite=H00].

For any graph G of bounded degree, we have pc,site(G) < 1 if and only if pc,bond(G) < 1.

Given a site percolation X̂ on [formula], we write Gopen(X̂) for the (random) graph whose vertex set consists of all [formula] such that X̂(x) = 1, and whose edge set consists of all pairs of such vertices at L1-distance 1 from each other. Analogously, Gclosed(X̂) has vertex set consisting of all [formula] such that X̂(x) = 0, and edge set consisting of all pairs of such vertices at L1-distance 1 from each other.

There exists a translation invariant site percolation X̂ such that with probability 1 we have both pc,bond(Gopen(X̂)) < 1 and pc,bond(Gclosed(X̂)) < 1.

Before proving this result, which is our main task, we show how it easily implies Theorem [\ref=thm:main].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:main] from Theorem [\ref=thm:two_big_clusters]. Let X̂ be as in Theorem [\ref=thm:two_big_clusters]. By Lemma [\ref=lem:site_vs_bond], we then have a.s. that pc,site(Gopen(X̂)) < 1 and pc,site(Gclosed(X̂)) < 1. We can then find an [formula] such that

[formula]

In fact, we may without loss of generality assume that the event in ([\ref=eq:uniform_eps]) has probability 1, because the event is translation invariant so that conditioning on it does not mess up translation invariance.

Now obtain another site percolation X̄ from X̂ by letting, for each [formula] independently,

[formula]

It is immediate that the translation invariance property of X̂ is inherited by X̄. Furthermore, the transformation ([\ref=eq:uniform_perturbation]) implies (regardless of the details of X̂) that

[formula]

so X̄ satisfies uniform finite energy. Next, pc,site(Gopen(X̂)) < 1  -  ε implies that the set of sites in Gopen(X̂) that remain unflipped through the transformation ([\ref=eq:uniform_perturbation]) contains an infinite cluster; and analogously for Gclosed(X̂). In summary, X̄ has all the properties needed to warrant Theorem [\ref=thm:main]. [formula]

It remains to prove Theorem [\ref=thm:two_big_clusters]. It is instructive to think about why the X̂ from Section [\ref=sect:first] will not do. In that example, for each open vertex [formula], Gopen(X̂) contains only a single infinite self-avoiding path starting at x. Carrying out i.i.d. bond percolation with retention parameter 1 - ε on Gopen(X̂) will, regardless of how small ε > 0 is, a.s. kill at least one edge on this path and thus cut off x from any infinite cluster. Thus, pc,bond(Gopen(X̂)) = 1 (and, analogously, pc,bond(Gclosed(X̂)) = 1), so this choice of X̂ fails to be a witness to Theorem [\ref=thm:two_big_clusters].

What made the infinite clusters of X̄ of Section [\ref=sect:first] survive was the inhomogeneity of the retention probabilities, sufficiently rapidly approaching 1 as we moved from [formula] off along its single self-avoiding path to infinity. When the retention parameter is set fixed at 1 - ε, we could try another approach: to replace the single path from x to infinity by a road that becomes progressively broader (and therefore more robust to random thinning) as we move along it. Some intuitive evidence that this should be doable comes from the work of Grimmett [\cite=G81] and others concerning i.i.d. bond percolation on graphs Gf arising by restricting the [formula] lattice to vertices [formula] with x1  ≥  0 and 0  ≤  x2  ≤  f(x1) (and the usual nearest-neighbor edges connecting them), where [formula] is a function that grows towards infinity as its argument goes to infinity. It turns out that a relatively slow growth of f suffices to ensure that pc,bond(Gf) < 1; in particular, Grimmett showed that the critical value pc,bond(Gf) equals that of the full [formula] lattice (i.e., pc,bond(Gf) = 1 / 2) if and only if lim n  →    ∞f(n) /  log (n) =   ∞  .

The fact that such slow growth of f is enough suggests that it should be possible to modify the tree-structure of the X̂ of Section [\ref=sect:first] in such a way as to obtain a witness to Theorem [\ref=thm:two_big_clusters]. This is what we set out to do in the following. For technical reasons, we opt for a tree-like structure with a lot more regularity than the example in Section [\ref=sect:first]. Our construction will be built up from rectangular sets on a sequence of larger and larger scales. The percolation theory developed in the last few decades offers an abundance of results concerning crossing probabilities in i.i.d. percolation on such rectangles. We will settle for one which is due to Bollobás and Riordan - see Lemma [\ref=lem:BR] below - although other choices would certainly have been possible.

Due to the amount of work needed to prove Theorem [\ref=thm:two_big_clusters], we divide it into a number of smaller portions. First, in Section [\ref=sect:rectangles], we introduce the terminology needed for a precise discussion of crossing probabilities for i.i.d. percolation and the Bollobás-Riordan result. Then, in Section [\ref=sect:building_blocks], we define the basic building blocks of our construction. In Sections [\ref=sect:open] and [\ref=sect:closed], we go on to some preliminary considerations that will be crucial for showing pc,bond(Gopen) < 1 and pc,bond(Gclosed) < 1, respectively. The construction is completed in Section [\ref=sect:actual_construction], and in Section [\ref=sect:finishing_the_proof] we finally establish pc,bond(Gopen) < 1 and pc,bond(Gclosed) < 1, thus completing the proof.

Rectangles and crossing probabilities

If S1,S2 are subsets of [formula] then we will call them congruent if there exists a [formula] so that S1  =  S2 + v. Note that for us d will be 1 or 2. If [formula] and [formula], then we say that B is a block. A subset R of [formula] will be called a rectangle if it can be written as R  =  B1  ×  B2, where the Bi's are blocks; if the blocks are congruent, we call it a square. If B1 has l elements and B2 has k, we say that R is an l  ×  k rectangle. The sets ( min B1)  ×  B2 and ( max B1)  ×  B2 are called the (left and right, respectively) vertical sides of R. The sets B1  ×  ( min B2) and B1  ×  ( max B2) will be the (bottom and top, respectively) horizontal sides.

We shall need the notion of crossing in a rectangle when preforming i.i.d. bond percolation with retention probability p - indicated by writing [formula] for the probability measure - on it. For such a percolation process on a rectangle R, the event H(R) defined as the set of those subgraphs of R containing a path between the two different vertical sides will be called a horizontal crossing in R. The event V(R) which we define by interchanging the words vertical and horizontal above called a vertical crossing in R.

Furthermore, we say that a rectangle Q  =  A1  ×  A2 is well-joined to the rectangle R = B1  ×  B2 if either

A1  ⊂  B1 and B2  ⊂  A2 (in which case we say that their being "well-joined" is of type vertical to horizontal or V  →  H)

or

B1  ⊂  A1 and A2  ⊂  B2 (in which case we say that their being "well-joined" is of type horizontal to vertical or H  →  V).

If [formula] is a sequence of rectangles, we say that it is well-joined if every pair of consecutive rectangles from the sequence is well-joined and the sequence of their types is alternating (i.e: [formula] ). The importance of this concept will be the following: if we have a sequence of well-joined rectangles [formula] and the first type is (say) V  →  H and if all the events

[formula]

hold then we can easily extract an infinite path from the individual crossings (given the appropriate vertical or horizontal crossings for the rectangles in the sequence). Moreover, if we know a lower bound for the individual probabilities of the above events, then by the well-known Harris-FKG inequality which states that for i.i.d. percolation any two increasing events are positively correlated (see, e.g., [\cite=G]) we can get a lower bound for the probability of an infinite path simply by multiplication. We shall make use of the following result of Bollobás and Riordan [\cite=BR].

Fix an integer λ  >  1 and a [formula]. We can then find constants γ  =  γ(λ,p)  >  0 and n0 = n0(λ,p) such that if n > n0, then for each λn  ×  n rectangle R we have [formula].

From this result, we obtain the following.

For any fixed [formula], we can find a c > 0, a positive integer n0 and a γ > 0 such that for any positive integer L the following holds. If R is an Ln  ×  n rectangle where n  >  n0, then [formula].

Proof. Take λ = 3 in Lemma [\ref=lem:BR] and let γ be the corresponding γ(3,p) and n0 be the corresponding n0(3,p). Let R be an Ln  ×  n rectangle. R can be covered by overlapping "little" 3n  ×  n rectangles in such a way that the intersection of a consecutive pair of them is an n  ×  n square and we can do it in such a way that altogether the number of the 3n  ×  n rectangles and n  ×  n squares is not greater than L. Notice that if we have horizontal crossings for all the 3n  ×  n rectangles and vertical crossings for all the n  ×  n squares, then we have a horizontal crossing for the whole Ln  ×  n rectangle. Then, by the Harris-FKG inequality, we can estimate [formula] from below as (1 - n-  γ)L. But this quantity equals ((1 - n-  γ)nγ)L / nγ, so the corollary follows from the fact that (1 - n-  γ)nγ is bounded away from zero. [formula]

Building blocks

For a finite set [formula], we let [formula] denote the smallest block containing K. If C has the form

[formula]

where d > 1 is some integer, and B is a block with |B| = l, then we say that C is a block progression, and we refer to l as the block length and d as the block distance in C. We say that (l,d) is the parameter of C. We will refer to the sets Bk = B + (l + d)k as the blocks of C. We call a block D a gap of C if it is in the complement of C and maximal with that property. Note that in that case |D| = d. If L is a positive integer, [formula] and C is a block progression as above, then we say that T is a block progression over C with factor L if

[formula]

where D is a gap of C. Let C1 and C2 be two congruent block progressions. The blocks of Ci will be denoted as Bij where [formula]. Let

[formula]

Then the set [formula] defined as

[formula]

will be called the grid determined by C1 and C2. The parameter of the grid above will be the parameter of Ci. If G and H are grids we say that H is a grid over G with factor L if, whenever G is determined by Ci and H is determined by Ti for i∈{1,2}, Ti is a block progression over Ci with factor L.

We now go on to define finite analogues of the above concepts. If B is a block and [formula], then we say that C is a block complex. Next we define the notion of a window. Let C1 and C2 be two congruent block complexes. The blocks of Ci will be denoted as Bij, where [formula]. Let

[formula]

Then the set [formula] defined as

[formula]

will be called the window determined by C1 and C2.

We shall call the Vi's and Hj's the frames of the given window. The convex hull of a window in [formula] is a square whose intersection with [formula] is the shade of the window. If we take the set theoretic complement of the frames in the shade, then the resulting set splits into squares in [formula]. We refer to those squares as the panes of the window. For a window W as above let us refer to the corresponding block length (independent of i and j) |Bij| as the "frame width" of W, denoted as [formula]. Also [formula] will be called the "side length" of W and we denote it as [formula].

For a window W as above we define its fork as follows: It will be the union of q - 1 vertical parts and one horizontal part. The vertical parts (we shall call them the cut-frames of the fork) are the sets of the form

[formula]

where [formula]. That is, we cut off each vertical strip at the top and we throw away the leftmost vertical strip. The horizontal part (which we shall call the bottom of the fork) will be

[formula]

Thus altogether the fork of W is defined as

[formula]

Preliminaries for pc,bond(Gopen) < 1

If we have two windows W and W+, we write [formula] to indicate that the shade of W is a pane of W+ (note that this relation is not transitive). If we have a sequence

[formula]

of windows then we write [formula] to indicate [formula] for each k.

If we have a sequence as above we define the set k(S), and when the sequence S is understood we write simply k; [formula] stands for "Escape route to the Right and to the Bottom". Note that for k > 1, k will be the union of two rectangles. First observe that if [formula] holds, then there is a unique vertical frame V+ of W+ which is attached to W from the right in the sense that [formula] is nonempty. Now consider [formula]. Let V+k be the unique vertical frame attached to Wk - 1 from the right. Then cut(V+k) will be one of the rectangles whose union is k. To define the other rectangle we take the bottom Bk of F(Wk) and we extend it to the right to get the "extended bottom"

[formula]

Now let us define

[formula]

Note that

[formula]

while

[formula]

Now we want to extend this definition to k = 1 as well. Note that the definition for Ek can be adapted to the case k = 1 with no difficulty. The only thing that we do not have a natural choice for is a cut-frame. We simply define W1 as [formula]. Finally we define the road [formula] of the sequence S above as

[formula]

The importance of the road is the following. If in the i.i.d. percolation each edge inside 1 remains open and for each k for k > 1 we have a vertical crossing for the corresponding cut-frame and a horizontal crossing for the corresponding bottom, then for each point of F(W1) there is an open path to infinity. Note that, besides the exceptional k = 1 case, the remaining parts of the road can be considered as a sequence of well-joined rectangles.

Preliminaries for pc,bond(Gclosed) < 1

If we are in the shade of a window but not in its fork, then we can move to the left top corner of the window by moving always outside of the fork. More specifically, if we have

[formula]

then we define the corresponding k(S) as follows, [formula] being short for "Escape route to the Left and to the Top". Consider the pair [formula]. Take the leftmost vertical frame Vlk - 1 of Wk - 1 note that this is contained in the complement of F(Wk - 1). Let ext(Vlk - 1) be the rectangle maximal for the following properties. It is contained in the shade of Wk, while its "horizontal component" is the same as that of Vlk - 1 in the sense that if Vlk - 1 = A  ×  B and ext(Vlk - 1) = Â  ×  B̂ then A = Â, and we also have

[formula]

and

[formula]

Also let Htk be the topmost horizontal frame of Wk and let

[formula]

For the record, note the size of these two rectangles: ext(Vlk - 1) is a [formula] one, while Htk is a [formula] one. If we take a similar union for the [formula]'s as we had for the [formula]'s then we will have an infinite "road" to infinity moving strictly outside of the forks of the windows in the sequence (but still in the windows).

The actual construction

The site percolation [formula] that we are about to define will depend on two initial parameters d0 and l0 and a sequence of positive integers [formula] where the latter sequence "grows fast" in a later-specified way. We choose d0  ≥  l0  >  n0 where n0 is from Corollary [\ref=cor:BR].

Note that there are only finitely many different translates of a given grid so we can choose uniformly a grid G0 with parameter (l0,d0) among the finitely many congruent copies. If Gk has been defined for a positive integer k, then let Gk + 1 be a uniformly chosen grid over Gk with factor Lk + 1. If the Li grow fast enough, then a.s. any [formula] will be in Gk for only finitely many k.

If the grid Gi has parameter (li,di), then Gi + 1 will have parameter (li + 1,di + 1) = (di,Li + 1li + (Li + 1 - 1)di). Then for li + di we have the simple recursion

[formula]

which clearly implies

[formula]

Now color the points x of [formula] with colors [formula] as follows: if x is not in any of the Gk, then x gets the color - 1, otherwise it gets the largest k for which x∈Gk.

It is crucial to make sure that any vertex be in only finitely many of the G's, for which a Borel-Cantelli argument is enough if the Lk's grows fast enough. We now give a sufficient condition for that. Let us estimate the probability that the origin is in Gk (by invariance the same estimate works for any given vertex). If we have a grid H with parameter (l,d) then instead of looking at this as a union of certain vertical and horizontal "infinite rectangles" we can visualize [formula] as partitioned into a disjoint union of (l + d)  ×  (l + d) squares and consider the portion H has within each of the squares. These portions will give us the probabilities that a particular point is contained in H. To compute these portions we choose the squares so that their intersection with H is especially simple, namely for each square K from the partition the following holds: [formula] is the union of two rectangles Rv and Rh (here h,v refers to "horizontal" and "vertical" respectively) so that Rv has type l  ×  (l + d) and Rh has type (l + d)  ×  l and Rv is the "leftmost" rectangle of that type contained in K while Rh is the "topmost" one, meaning that neither ( - 1,0) + Rv nor Rh + (0,1) is contained in K. This gives us that [formula] while obviously K = (l + d)2. Then the probability of the origin being in H (if H is uniformly selected as was the case with the Gk's) equals

[formula]

Now let us check what condition on [formula] needed to make the Borel-Cantelli argument work. In order to do that consider H = Gi + 1 so the probability of the origin being in H is

[formula]

which, with a little bit of arithmetic, becomes

[formula]

For Borel-Cantelli to work we need that summing these positive numbers over i yields a finite value, and for that it is clearly enough that the sum of li + 1 / (li + 1 + di + 1) converges. To see how it relates to [formula] we spell out our recursions again:

[formula]

So it is enough to have

[formula]

After this Borel-Cantelli interlude, we now turn back to the construction. Observe that each color class splits into a disjoint union of windows. Actually a more precise "structural observation" is true: A point x of color class k is always contained in a window W(x) each of whose points has the same color with [formula] and [formula]. Also for this W(x) there exists a W+(x) each of whose points has color k + 1 so that [formula]. Altogether we find that for an x of color class k we have a sequence [formula] of windows where each point of Wj(x) is of color class k + j - 1.

The construction is simply to take the forks of all of the windows: our translation invariant site percolation [formula] arises by assigning value 1 to x precisely for those [formula] that belong to such a fork. Let us write [formula] (short for "Random Forks") for Gopen(X̂) and * for Gclosed(X̂).

Nontriviality of the critical values

It remains to show that pc,bond() < 1 and pc,bond(*) < 1; we begin with the former. If [formula] is in [formula] consider [formula] as above. With positive probability x is of color class 1. Moreover, still with positive probability, each edge in 1 remains open. We will condition on this event.

Then we can use the notion of road [formula] introduced in Section [\ref=sect:open]. Because of the conditioning we just declared, we can focus on the parts in the road which corresponded to indices k > 1. Let us apply the strategy we described in Section [\ref=sect:rectangles] in connection with the notion of being well-joined. We need the side lengths of the rectangles constituting the road, and to substitute the frame widths and side lengths of [formula] into the formulas ([\ref=eq:star]) and ([\ref=eq:star_star]) in Section [\ref=sect:open]. The vertical rectangle at the ith step of the road for x is an li  ×  (di + 1 - li) one while the next horizontal one is a (di + 1 + li + 1 - li)  ×  li one. Note that from the point of view of crossing an 2di  +  1  ×  li (horizontal) rectangle and an li  ×  2di + 1 (vertical) is just worse than any of the above so if we find a lower bound for their having the appropriate crossings then that bound works for the original rectangles as well.

Now by using the recursion ([\ref=eq:main_recussion]) we obtain estimates for the side lengths:

[formula]

Note that (simply because li + 2 = di + 1) we also have

[formula]

and furthermore

[formula]

In other words we have 2Li + 1Li  >  di + 1  /  li. Now apply Corollary [\ref=cor:BR] to the above li  ×  2di + 1 rectangle R. Then 4Li + 1Li may play the role of L in the corollary, which then tells us that

[formula]

We next use the fact that the sequence of rectangles defined above (i.e. the "road" we get when we take a vertical strip from the fork and go down to the bottom horizontal one and the move to the vertical strip in the next level and so on...) is well-joined. The estimate ([\ref=eq:each_level]) together with the Harris-FKG inequality implies that the probability of the sequence containing an infinite path is greater than

[formula]

where the factor 2 in the power corresponds to taking both the horizontal and vertical rectangles into account at a given step, and the index i going from 2 corresponds to the conditioning declared at the beginning of Section [\ref=sect:finishing_the_proof]. The product ([\ref=eq:product]) is positive exactly when

[formula]

Recall the balance we need to establish: on one hand, the L's need to grow fast enough so that Borel-Cantelli applies to show only finitely many of the events x∈Gk hold, while on the other hand they need to grow slowly enough to make sure that the sum ([\ref=eq:what_we_want]) converges. But of course with the given conditions there is plenty of room for that because as we saw the li is essentially the product of all Lk's up to index i. We can even allow the L's to grow exponentially. Indeed, let Li = 2i. Then we see that the term corresponding to index i + 2 of the above sum is 22i + 5  /  lγi  +  2. Now note that

[formula]

We note that 22i + 5  /  lγi  +  2 can be bounded from above as some constant multiplied by 2-  αi2  +  βi  +  δ (where [formula]) whose sum (over i) is clearly convergent. (In fact, we could consider even faster growing L's as long as we make sure that the product of the first some terms should be much bigger than the next two terms.)

This justifies our claim that pc,bond() < 1 for [formula], and it remains only to establish the analogous claim pc,bond(*) < 1. For that purpose we do a computation very similar to the above one but now applied to the road defined by the [formula]'s. Note that the sizes of the vertical and horizontal rectangles in k are dk + 1  ×  lk for the horizontal one and lk - 1  ×  (dk + 1 - lk) for the vertical one, and furthermore that in this case both crossing probabilities for the above considered two rectangles is not less then the horizontal crossing probability for a dk + 1  ×  lk - 1 one.

First we need an estimate for the ratio di + 1 / li - 1. We use again the basic recursion for the (l + d)'s we had at the "structural observation":

[formula]

So now the quantity 2Li + 1LiLi - 1 can play the role of L from Corollary [\ref=cor:BR]. So we need

[formula]

Now if we make the same kinds of estimates as for [formula], we see that the i'th term in this case will be 23i + 3  /  lγi. So in the numerator we still have an exponent linear in i, while in the denominator we have an exponent of second order, so the sum in ([\ref=eq:what_we_need_this_time]) is indeed finite, and the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:two_big_clusters] is complete.
