Muonic hydrogen and MeV forces

Introduction

A recent publication [\cite=Pohl:2010zz] announced a measurement of the Lamb shift in muonic hydrogen that seems to require a value of the proton's radius, rp = 0.84184(67) fm, which differs by five standard deviations from the value given in the CODATA compilation [\cite=Mohr:2008fa], rp = 0.8768(69) fm. It is of course possible that the reason for the different values of rp extracted from muonic and electronic hydrogen lies within the standard model, involving subtle QED and/or hadronic effects. It is nevertheless worth considering whether new physics could be the explanation. Here we explore the possibility that the discrepancy arises from the existence of a roughly MeV-mass force carrier that couples the muon to the proton. As we will see, such a force can also resolve the long-standing discrepancy between theory and observation in (g - 2)μ measurements. However, atomic precision measurements and neutron scattering experiments at low energies constrain the coupling of this new force to electrons and neutrons, respectively. It is not difficult to construct models that effectively decouple the force carrier from the electron (by arranging for the particle to couple to mass) or the neutron (by arranging for the particle to couple to charge), but decoupling it from both is a more serious challenge to model building attempts. Taking the force to act on muons and protons only, it is still possible to make predictions for energy shifts in related systems - muonic deuterium, muonic helium, and true muonium - with minimal model-dependence.

Contributions to the Lamb Shift in Hydrogenic Systems

Independent of whether the new force is mediated by a scalar or a vector-boson, the non-relativistic potential between the proton and muon can be written as

[formula]

where mφ is the mass of the force carrier, s is its spin, and gμ and gp are its couplings to the muon and proton, respectively. A similar expression holds for the electronic-hydrogen system. Note, however, that the sign of the potential may be different depending on the relative sign between ge and gμ.

This potential gives an additional contribution to the Lamb shift in the 2S1 / 2-2P3 / 2 transition, which using first-order perturbation theory is given by

[formula]

with f(x)  =  x4 / (1 + x)4. Here aμ  =  (αmμp)- 1 is the Bohr radius of the system to leading order and mμp is the reduced mass of the μ-p system. A similar expression holds for the e-p system, but the Bohr radius is a factor ≈  mμ / me larger. This expression is convenient for a direct comparison with the leading order contribution from the proton radius,

[formula]

where rp is the proton's radius, and n( = 2) is the principle quantum number.

If everything else is the same between the e-p and μ-p systems, then since f(x) is a monotonically increasing function that asymptotes to unity at large values of x, the resulting energy shift in the e-p system is always larger than the corresponding shift in the μ-p system [\cite=Jaeckel:2010xx]. If the force is attractive in both systems, the apparent proton radius will always appear smaller in the e-p system, contrary to observations. An attractive force must therefore couple more strongly to muons than to electrons if it is to explain the discrepancy in the proton-radius determination.

A different possibility is that ge is not suppressed relative to gμ, but the force is repulsive, leading to a larger apparent proton-radius in the e-p system. This possibility is consistent with the (g - 2)e constraint discussed in the next section. However, since the effects of such a light force are suppressed at higher momentum transfer, this possibility seems in tension with the value of the proton radius extracted from scattering data which generally also imply a larger proton radius [\cite=Hill:2010yb]. Therefore, for the purpose of this paper, we concentrate on the possibility that it is a new attractive force that modifies the μ-p system.

Contributions to (g - 2)e,μ

The scalar and vector-boson contributions to the electron and muon anomalous magnetic moments are [\cite=Schwinger:1948iu] [\cite=Jackiw:1972jz],

[formula]

where ml is the mass of the electron or muon, and

[formula]

For ml  ≫  mφ we have the asymptotic behaviors ξscalar  →  3 / 2 and ξvector  →  1.

We begin with the electron system. As emphasized in ref. [\cite=Pospelov:2008zw], the (g - 2)e measurement is currently used to define the fine-structure constant α. The additional contribution to (g - 2)e therefore acts as a shift of the fine-structure constant as Δα  =  2πΔae. Comparing this correction to measurements made in Rb and Cs atoms [\cite=Clade:2006zz] [\cite=Gerginov:2006zz], the shift in α must not exceed 15 ppb, which constrains the coupling to electrons as [\cite=Pospelov:2008zw]

[formula]

For mφ  ≈   ~   MeV this constraint translates to [formula] and [formula] for scalar and vector mediators, respectively. The constraint is weakened for larger values of mφ.

More important for the purpose of a direct comparison with the Lamb shift in the μ-p system is the constraint coming from measurement of (g - 2)μ [\cite=Bennett:2006fi]. At present, the theoretical prediction for athμ seems to indicate a deficit of [formula] compared with the experimental value aexpμ [\cite=Passera:2008hj]. For a given mass mφ we can extract the values of gμ that bring the theoretical and experimental values of (g - 2)μ into agreement. In fact, these values are insensitive to mφ provided mφ  ≪  mμ is satisfied, giving [formula] for a vector and [formula] for a scalar. In Fig. [\ref=fig:deltaEvsM] we plot the 2S1 / 2-2P3 / 2 energy shift, Eq. ([\ref=eqn:energyshift]), against the mass of the mediator, mφ, fixing the coupling to muons in this way. For the purpose of the plot we take gp  =  gμ, but the result for other choices is easily obtained, as the energy shift is proportional to gp.

As the plot indicates, a new force with a mass ≈   ~   MeV and a coupling to muons that explains the discrepancy in the muon anomalous magnetic moment can also give the required energy shift in muonic hydrogen to reconcile the proton-radius extracted from this system with the one extracted from hydrogen and electron-proton scattering. The mediator mass that gives the maximum energy shift is near an ~   MeV because it is essentially determined by the Bohr radius of the μ-p system, a- 1μ  =  0.69 ~   MeV. The choice gp  ≈  gμ favors mφ  ≈   ~   MeV, but a different mass can be accommodated by increasing gp accordingly. For mφ  ≫   ~   MeV (mφ  ≪   ~   MeV) the required coupling becomes large and scales as m2φ (m- 2φ).

For mφ  ≈   ~   MeV the coupling to muons necessary to explain both discrepancies turns out to be close to the muon mass divided by the electroweak scale, mμ / v  =  4.3  ×  10- 4. A Higgs-like coupling proportional to the mass would resolve any tension with the constraint from (g - 2)e on the electron coupling, Eq. ([\ref=eqn:g-2_e]). However, it implies that the coupling to neutrons is comparable to the coupling to protons, gn  ≈  gp, which seems severely constrained by neutron scattering experiments, as we discuss in the following section.

Constraints

The most model-independent constraint on an MeV-scale interaction between muons and protons comes from measurements of the 3d5 / 2-2p3 / 2 transitions in 24Mg and 28Si [\cite=Beltrami:1985dc]. A weighted-average between the results from 24Mg and 28Si was used to obtain the limit, [formula]. For mφ  ≈   ~   MeV this translates to a 95% CL limit gpgμ / e2  <  3.1  ×  10- 6, assuming coupling only to protons. This measurement therefore allows the couplings necessary to explain the muonic hydrogen and (g - 2)μ discrepancies. Mild tension does arise if one assumes that the new force carrier also couples to neutrons since the bound improves by a factor of 2. However, as we now discuss, such a coupling to the neutron is much better constrained by neutron scattering experiments.

A new force carrier with an MeV mass that couples to neutrons produces sizable corrections to the scattering cross-section of neutrons on heavy nuclei. This was first realized by Barbieri and Ericson [\cite=Barbieri:1975xy] who used the results of an old experiment [\cite=Aleksandrov:1966] on the polarizability of the neutron to set a limit on any additional force carrier that interferes with the strong interaction amplitude. They showed that such a force will contribute to the angular dependence of the differential cross-section in a distinct manner as compared with the contribution from the strong interactions. Assuming that the new force couples equally to both protons and neutrons, the bound on the nucleon coupling is

[formula]

This is about an order of magnitude smaller than the necessary coupling to muons and protons discussed above. A more recent analysis arrived at a similar result [\cite=Schmiedmayer:1991zz] [\cite=Leeb:1992qf] although the claimed precision of that experiment was later questioned (see Ref. [\cite=Wissmann:1998ta] and references therein).

The bound in Eq. ([\ref=eqn:neutronbound]) arises from an interference term between the strong amplitude and the amplitude due to the new force. As such, it may be susceptible to cancellations involving other parts of the amplitude, and it also depends on the relative phase of the strong and new-physics amplitudes. Nevertheless, the constraint is sufficiently strong to disfavor gn  ≈  gp. The bound on the neutron coupling would have to be invalidated by more than an order of magnitude to allow for a simultaneous explanation of (g - 2)μ and the muonic hydrogen results while requiring gn  ≈  gp, a possibility which we therefore eschew in this letter.

There are several other constraints on such a light boson, but they all involve further assumptions about its couplings to matter. Refs. [\cite=Kohler:1974zz] [\cite=Freedman:1984sd] use 16O and 4He atoms to search for 0+  →  0+  +  φ transitions to constrain light bosons with Higgs-like couplings. These bounds are not very useful for mφ  ≈   ~   MeV and in any case depend sensitively on the decay properties of φ. For example, the bounds do not apply if φ decays promptly, or if φ is too light to decay into an electron-positron pair. Ref. [\cite=Davier:1989wz] has searched for a light boson emitted in the scattering of electrons against the nucleus. It sets a strong bound on the coupling to the electron for masses in the range 1.2  <  mφ  <  52 ~   MeV. However, it too relies on the φ lifetime being in a certain range. Ref. [\cite=Egli:1989vu] sets a very strong limit on the decay π+  →  e+νe(φ  →  e+e-) and excludes masses in the range 10 < mφ  <  110 ~   MeV, but again relies on the coupling to electrons. Finally, we note that any coupling to neutrinos must also be strongly suppressed as such an interaction will strongly affect the well measured interactions of neutrinos with matter.

Contributions to energy shifts in other muonic systems

We now move on to discuss predictions concerning other muonic systems such as muonic deuterium and helium, and true muonium. Neglecting any possible coupling to the neutrons, the energy shift in the 2S-2P transition due to the new force is given by a simple generalization of Eq. ({[\ref=eqn:energyshift]). Accounting for the change in the reduced mass and the atomic number, it can be written in terms of the contribution to the energy shift in muonic hydrogen,

[formula]

where N stands for the different possible nuclei (deuterium, helium, and etc.) and Z is the atomic number.

The most straightforward prediction is that, more or less independent of the mediator's mass, the muonic deuterium system, μ-D, should exhibit almost exactly the same energy shift in the 2S-2P transition as the μ-p system. Depending on mφ, it deviates from it by at most [formula] due to the change in the reduced mass, and we therefore predict [formula].

Next we consider the muonic helium system. The 2S1 / 2-2P3 / 2 and 2S1 / 2-2P1 / 2 level splittings in (μ-  ~  4He)+ muonic ion were measured in the 70's and reported in refs. [\cite=Carboni:1976wb] [\cite=Carboni:1977uw]. Unfortunately, these measurements were later criticized by other groups which cast doubt on the validity of the results. Experimentally [\cite=Hauser:1992zz], the 2S1 / 2-2P3 / 2 resonance was not found at the frequency reported by ref. [\cite=Carboni:1976wb]. Theoretically [\cite=Landua:1982hp], the lifetime of the 2S state is predicted to be too short at the pressure (40 bar) used in the experiment, a result which was later confirmed experimentally by ref. [\cite=Eckhause:1985cz]. However, further measurements on muonic helium are planned in the near future at PSI [\cite=Pohl:2010zz]. In Fig. [\ref=fig:deltaEHevsM] we plot the prediction for the 2S-2P energy-shift in this system as a function of the mediator mass, mφ.

A new force that couples to muons would also contribute to the energy levels of true muonium (μ+-μ- bound state), a system that is yet to be observed. In an ineresting recent proposal, the authors of Ref. [\cite=Brodsky:2009gx] have discussed two possible production mechanisms, e+e-  →  μ+μ- and e+e-  →  γμ+μ-, as particularly promising channels. If in addition to production, spectroscopic studies of true muonium can be achieved, then it may be possible to observe the small energy-shift due to the force carrier exchange. In Fig. [\ref=fig:deltaEmumuvsM] we plot the predicted energy shift in the 2S-2P transition when the muon coupling, gμ, is chosen so as to fix the discrepancy in (g - 2)μ. This energy shift is much smaller than the expected level-splitting due to vacuum polarization and will undoubtedly be very difficult to observe. Nevertheless, it serves as an unambiguous prediction that may be tested in the future.

Conclusions

A new force carrier with a mass of ≈   ~   MeV that couples to both protons and muons with gμ,p  ≈  4  ×  10- 4 can explain the discrepancies observed in both (g - 2)μ and the muonic hydrogen 2S1 / 2-2P3 / 2 energy splitting. However, the coupling of such a new force to either neutrons or electrons is constrained by several past measurements. Nevertheless, none of these constraints exclude this possibility in a model-independent way. Assuming only couplings to muons and protons, this possibility lends itself to concrete predictions for the expected energy shifts in muonic deuterium and helium as well as true muonium.

Note added: While this paper was being completed ref. [\cite=Barger:2010aj] appeared, which also considers new-physics contributions to the Lamb shift in muonic hydrogen.
