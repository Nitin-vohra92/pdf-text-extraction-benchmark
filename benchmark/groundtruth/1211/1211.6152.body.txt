Remarks on numerical relativity,geodesic motions,binary neutron star evolution

PACS 04.20 - General relativity.

1. Introduction. In sect. 2 we recall properties and geodesics of the Gaussian-normal coordinate system. In sect. 3 we emphasize that the physical results derived from any solution of Einstein field equations must be independent of the adopted reference frame. In sects. 4 and 5 we give a résumé of the properties of the (3 + 1)-decompositions of Einstein equations, and we point out that: i) the results of the approximate computations obtained with the employment of the gravitational energy-pseudotensor have an illusive value; ii) coordinate-system independence of the results is not proved; iii) no mathematical theorem of existence supports the approximate computations of numerical relativity. Sect. 5bis: the particles of a discrete "cloud of dust" describe geodesic lines - and therefore no GW is emitted by them: an emblematic instance. Sects. 6 and 7 contain some comments on the numerical computations concerning the binaries composed of two "Schwarschildian mass-points" and of two neutron stars; an analysis is given of the notions of ADM-mass. Appendix A: The Einstein equations in a Gaussian-normal frame. Appendix B: The equations of the standard (3 + 1)-decomposition. Appendix C: The four-dimensional world as "a mass of plasticine" (Weyl), and some interesting consequences.

2. - The concept of Gaussian-normal coordinate system is due to Hilbert [\cite=1]. Landau and Lifshitz called it synchronous [\cite=2]. Let us consider in the four-dimensional world a three-dimensional space S3 such that every line in it is space-like; (x1,x2,x3) be the point-coordinates in S3. Starting from each point (x1,x2,x3), we trace the geodesic lines which are orthogonal to S3. They will become particular time-like lines if we report on them the time x0 = c  t as the proper time τ. It follows easily that

[formula]

By virtue of the very construction of the three-dimensional space x0 = 0, the quadratic form gαβ  xαxβ is necessarily a definite positive one.

It is interesting to write the differential equations of all the geodesic lines of the metric ([\ref=eq:one]). The Lagrangian L:

[formula]

where the overdot denotes a derivative with respect to an affine parameter σ, and A is a constant, gives the Lagrangian equations

[formula]

[formula]

L is a first integral of eqs.([\ref=eq:three]-[\ref=eq:threeprime]); A is negative,zero, positive for time-like, null, space-like geodesics, respectively. If σ  =  τ, we have A =  - 1. The geodesics orthogonal to x0 = 0 are characterized by [formula], and σ  =  τ.

The solutions of eqs.([\ref=eq:three]-[\ref=eq:threeprime]) are commonly interpreted, if σ  =  τ, as the trajectories of test-particles. However, they represent also the geodesic trajectories of the material elements of a "cloud", which generates the Gaussian field.

There are infinite expressions for the Gaussian-normal s2, which are obtained by one of them with: i) any Lorentz transformation of the spacetime coordinates, ii) any transformation of the space coordinates.

Landau and Lifshitz [\cite=2] write the Einstein field equations in a Gaussian-normal frame; then, they separate space - and time - derivatives, thus obtaining a particular (3 + 1)-formalism. All the operations of raising and lowering of the indices and the covariant derivatives are performed with respect to the space metric gαβ(x0,x1,x2,x3). They put καβ: = ∂gαβ  /  ∂t, and in their equations (99,10), (99,11), (99,12) (see App. A) the symbol Pβα denotes the Ricci tensor with respect to the three-dimensional space. It is immediate to divide eqs. (99,10), (99,11), (99,12) in constraint equations, containing gαβ and ∂gαβ  /  ∂t, and in evolution equations, containing ∂2gαβ  /  ∂t2. It can be proved [\cite=3] that

[formula]

where g is the determinant of the Gaussian metric matrix, and Fαβ is an entire rational function of the gαβ's, of the ∂gαβ  /  ∂t's, of the second spatial and spatiotemporal derivatives of gαβ. (Of course, Fαβ depends also on the matter tensor).

For the solution of the Cauchy problem it is necessary to give the values of gαβ and ∂gαβ  /  ∂t at all the space points (x1,x2,x3) at an initial instant t = t0.

3. - In principle, the Cauchy problem could be solved for any physical system in any system of coordinates, thus giving origin to an implicit, particular (3 + 1)-formulation of the problem.

As it was emphasized by Hilbert [\cite=1], as a rule any solution of Einstein field equations must satisfy the following criterion: all the physical results which we deduce from it must be independent of the coordinate system in which the solution is expressed. Of course, this does not exclude the existence of interesting physical phenomena - as, e.g., the gravitational redshift of the spectral lines -, whose entity depends on the chosen reference system. An emblematic instance of independence of the coordinate system is represented by the geodesic motions of the elements of a continuous "cloud of dust".

4. - The numerical relativity makes use of two (3 + 1)-decompositions of the Einstein field equations

[formula]

where (j,k) = (1,2,3), and c = G = 1. The matrix of the components of metric ([\ref=eq:five]) is:

In Appendix B we report the field equations of the standard decomposition.

If α = 1 and the three-vector βj is zero, eq. ([\ref=eq:five]) gives a Gaussian-normal s2. At p.37 of

5bis. - Articles and treatises of numerical relativity and (3 + 1)-decompositions of the Einstein equations contain many considerations and computations concerning the properties and the generation of GWs. We have given several demonstrations that GR, if properly understood, excludes the physical existence of GWs [\cite=5] - and the experience corroborates our proofs. Therefore, we do not discuss here the numerical-relativity methods regarding the GWs. We give instead the simple proof that also the motions of the particles of a discrete "cloud of dust" are geodesic. First of all, according to a method by Infeld [\cite=6] we write the Einstein equations, in a generic coordinate system x0,x1,x2,x3, using tensor densities:

[formula]

If δ(x - ξ): = δ(x1  -  ξ1)δ(x2  -  ξ2)δ(x3  -  ξ3) is the three-dimensional Dirac's distribution, and ξ1,ξ2,ξ3 are the coordinate of a particle, we put - if the "cloud" is composed of s particles:

[formula]

[formula]

now, if the world-lines of the particles never intersect, it is not difficult to verify that the equations of motion of the particles:

[formula]

where the semicolon denotes a covariant derivative, are the differential equations of geodesic lines. Consequently, no GW is generated by our "dust"; a result very general, because there exists no limitation for the values of the particle kinematical-elements (velocities, accelerations, time derivative of the accelerations, etc.).

We see that the gravitational self-force theory, which is based on a wrong analogy with the electromagnetic self-force of a charge, does not make any physical sense. And the post-Newtonian approximations which concern a discrete "cloud of dust" cannot give GWs.

6. - With regard to the binary stars composed of two Schwarzschildian mass-points (see, e.g., Chapt. 13 - "Binary Black Hole Evolution" - of

[formula]

. Now, the definition of the ADM-mass is founded on the properties of the gravitational energy-pseudotensor (see sect. 5), and therefore the physical meaning of an ADM-mass is rather uncertain.

Chapt. 16 of

[formula]

[formula]

: "... the concept of relative motion of several bodies has, as the postulate of general relativity shows, no more foundation than the concept of absolute motion of a single body. Let us imagine the four-dimensional world as a mass of plasticine traversed by individual fibers, the world lines of the material particles. Except for the condition that no two world lines intersect, their pattern may be arbitrarily given. The plasticine can then be continuously deformed so that not only one but all fibers become vertical straight lines." It is clear that this consideration implies that there exists always a coordinate transformation, which allows us to pass from any coordinate system for which some bodies are in motion to a co-moving coordinate system for which all these bodies are at rest.

Now, no class of privileged coordinate systems exists in GR, and any physical effect must be frame independent [\cite=1]. Consequently, the fact that bodies at rest cannot generate gravitational waves has a general significance: no coordinate system exists for which the motions of the bodies generate gravitational waves.

Remark that these considerations hold for the general case in which both gravitational and non-gravitational forces are present. For a different proof, founded on the Einstein field equations, that all the general-relativistic motions can be geodesically described, see our paper of ref. [\cite=9].

An immediate corollary: the gravitational field of a body, whose motion is geodesic, moves en bloc with the body, and is propagated instantaneously. In special relativity we have a partial analogue: the static-electromagnetic fields created by an electric charge in a rectilinear and uniform motion (a Minkowskian geodesic motion) move along with the charge, and are propagated instantaneously [\cite=10]. (This corresponds perfectly to the results found by an observer in a rectilinear and uniform motion, who travels with respect to the charge at rest).

This fact has been considered a paradox by some physicists, who have tried to get rid of it with the gratuitous surmise that it is hold only for infinite spatio-temporal motions of the electric charge.

An instantaneous propagation of a field is not always in contradiction with the theory of relativity. -
