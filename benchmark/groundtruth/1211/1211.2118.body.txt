Trees in simple Polygons

Introduction

Recently many papers have been published regarding the augmentation of discrete geometric objects, in particular a set of non-crossing segments in the plane. While these problems are studied, not just many open problems could be solved but also new tools developed. Among these tools is the simple and easy to prove lemma about matchings in polygons by Manuel Abellanas, Alfredo García Olaverri, Ferran Hurtado, Javier Tejel and Jorge Urrutia [\cite=DBLP:journals/comgeo/AbellanasOHTU08]. It gives sufficient conditions when a predefined set of vertices of a polygon can be geometrically matched within this polygon. It was recently used to show that the bichromatic compatible matching graph is connected [\cite=2012arXiv1207.2375A].

The main motivation of this note is to find a useful variation of this auspicious lemma about matchings in polygons. Trees with low maximal degree seemed curious. We show the existence of a max degree 3 tree spanning a prescribed set of vertices in a given polygon(to be made precise soon). We give explicit tight bounds on the number of degree 3 vertices in the attained tree. To the best of our knowledge this question has not been studied before.

As an application we give a new easy proof to an old result from Prosenjit Bose, Michael E. Houle and Godfried T. Toussaint [\cite=DBLP:journals/dcg/BoseHT01] that every set of non-crossing line segments in the plane admits a binary encompassing geometric tree. Later Michael Hoffmann, Bettina Speckmann and Csaba D. Tóth gave an alternative proof [\cite=Hoffmann201035]. A comparison of the their proof and ours reveals similarities, which will be explained later.

It is important to note that we assume general position throughout this note in the sense that no three segment endpoints are on a common line. Theorem [\ref=thm:main] also holds without this assumption.

Main Result

A PSLG (planar straight line graph) is a planar non-crossing embedding of a graph with straight edges. A simple polygon is a PSLG which is a cycle. We say that a PSLG G is inscribed in a simple polygon P if G is contained in the closed bounded region of P and for every edge e of G either: e is in the interior of P or e is also an edge of P.

We say a vertex of a simple polygon is reflex if the interior angle to its incident edges is larger than π and convex otherwise.

Let P be a simple polygon, R the set of reflex vertices of P and A  ⊇  R some superset of vertices of P. Further we can specify two vertices [formula] such that the following holds: There exists a PSLG T with vertex set A inscribed in P, which is a tree. The tree T satisfies the following degree restrictions:

[formula]

For every natural number n exists a polygon with n reflex vertices such that any tree with the properties above has n reflex vertices.

The proof goes by induction on the number of reflex vertices of P. For the induction basis assume P is convex. We aim to construct a path from v1 to v2 traversing the vertices of A. Consider the only two paths Q1 and Q2 on P connecting v1 and v2. One possible path from v1 to v2 traverses at first all vertices of A on Q1 in the order they appear on Q1 and traverses thereafter the remaining vertices on Q2, before it reaches v2. Clearly, deg(v1)  =  deg(v2)  =  1 and all other vertices have degree 2, see Figure [\ref=fig:convexCase]. It is an instructive exercise to count the number of such paths in a given convex polygon.

For the induction step assume that P has some reflex vertices and let r be such a reflex vertex of P, as in Figure [\ref=fig:inductionStep]. We shoot a ray from r into the interior of P in such a way that both angles at r become convex. We denote by q the first point on the boundary of P hit by the ray. We further assume that q is not a vertex of P. The segment rq splits P into two simple polygons P1 and P2. The vertices r and q are convex in P1 and P2. Both P1 and P2 have fewer reflex vertices than P. We denote the vertices of A in Pi with Ai. We list the vertex r in A1 and A2. We distinguish two cases.

Case 1 Both v1 and v2 specified in the Lemma are in the same polygon, say P1. Then we apply the induction hypothesis on P1 with the A1 and v1 and v2 as specified vertices. We receive a PSLG T1 with the above properties. In particular r has degree ≤  2 in T1. We also apply the induction hypothesis on P2 and A2 with r and any other vertex of [formula] specified. We receive a second tree T2 with the above properties and r has degree 1 in P2. The union [formula] has all the above properties and in particular r has degree at most 3.

Case 2 The specified vertices v1 and v2 are in different polygons P1 and P2 respectively. We apply the induction hypothesis on P1 with A1 and v1 and r as specified vertices. We receive a PSLG T1 with all the above properties and the degree of r in T1 is exactly one. Similarly there exists a PSLG T2 in P2 such that r has degree 1 in T2 the union [formula] satisfies all the properties in the Lemma and the degree of r is exactly 2. It remains to give an example of a polygon with n reflex vertices such that at any reflex vertex we must have degree 3. We start the construction with a regular polygon on 2n + 2 vertices. We add a spike to the vertices [formula], as shown in Figure [\ref=fig:tightExample] b). This creates new reflex vertices [formula] and new convex vertices [formula] and destroys the corresponding original vertices of the polygon. For any new convex vertex wck only the vertices wrk and wk - 1 are visible, by construction. We define A formally as

[formula]

We choose w2n + 1 and w2n + 2 as the marked vertices v1 and v2. It is clear, that in any encompassing PSLG as in Theorem [\ref=thm:main] the vertices at the spikes must have degree 1 as well as v1 and v2. Since the sum of the degrees is constant, exactly the reflex vertices must have degree 3.

The just proven Theorem needed the marked vertices v1 and v2 mainly for the induction to work. One could formulate the Theorem without mentioning them and only consider them in the proof, because they strengthen the result only slightly. To do so consider the case that A contains at least 2 convex vertices and mark them as v1 and v2. In the other case consider vertices with smallest and largest x-coordinate. They clearly are convex. Mark them as v1 and v2. They can be remove later from the tree, as they are leaves.

Application

In this paragraph we want to prove the existence of a binary tree spanning a set of disjoint line segments in the plane. It was proven first by Bose et al. [\cite=DBLP:journals/dcg/BoseHT01]. Later Hoffmann et al. gave a simpler alternative proof [\cite=Hoffmann201035]. We will give a third proof, as an application of Theorem [\ref=thm:main]. Our proof resembles the proof in [\cite=Hoffmann201035]. Roughly speaking Hoffmann et al. use a convex subdivision and the tunnel graph to assign the segment endpoints to neighboring cells in a clever way. We only construct one polygon, apply Theorem [\ref=thm:main] and delete some superfluous edges. Implicitly we also subdivide the plane into convex regions, but our assignment to the regions is more crude. That is why we have an additional clean up step in the end.

A PSLG is an encompassing tree of a set S of line segments in the plane if it is a tree as a graph and every line segment of S is an edge of the tree.

Let S be a set of n disjoint line segments in the plane with no 3 segment endpoints on a common line. Then there exists a max degree-3 planar encompassing tree of S.

The idea of the proof is to construct a simple polygon out of the set of line segments, apply Theorem [\ref=thm:main] and make some minor changes in order to attain the desired tree, see Figure [\ref=fig:overview]. The first step is to draw a bounding box P0 around S. Next we pick a segment s1 of S1  =  S which has a point on the boundary of the convex hull of S1. We extend s1 till it reaches the bounding box and becomes part of the new bounding polygon P1 itself. We continue iteratively. The set Si is defined to be [formula] and si∈Si is a segment which has a point on the boundary of the convex hull of Si. We extend si till it becomes part of the new bounding polygon Pi itself. See Figure [\ref=fig:overview] b) for an illustration. Clearly Pn is a polygon, though not simple. In the next step depicted in Figure [\ref=fig:overview] c), we draw a simple polygon Q in the interior of Pn. We want that the set of reflex vertices of Q and Pn agree and that Q is very close to Pn in the Hausdorff sense. As this is very intuitive we hope that the reader will be satisfied to know that this simplification step was used also for instance in [\cite=2012arXiv1207.2375A] lemma 1 and we refer to them for a rigorous proof. We want to apply Theorem [\ref=thm:main] on Q. Note that each line segment has exactly one reflex vertex in Q and these are the only reflex vertices of Q. We define A as the set of reflex vertices of Q and for each extended endpoint of a line segment we choose a closest point on Q to belong to A, see Figure [\ref=fig:overview] d). Thus A corresponds to the segment endpoints. The vertices v1 and v2 can be chosen arbitrarily. Now Theorem [\ref=thm:main] grants us the existence of a tree TQ in Q. We define T0 to be the graph which we attain when we connect the endpoints of the line segments whenever the corresponding points in A where connected by an edge in TQ. To see that this is possible consider any 2 segment endpoints a1,a2 and the corresponding points in A let us denote them by b1 and b2 respectively(not necessarily of the same segment). Observe that if Q and Pn are close enough that a1 sees a2 iff b1 sees b2 (Remember that we assume general position). See Figure [\ref=fig:overview] e). At last we add the line segments successively to T0. The tree Ti is defined to be Ti - 1 whenever the segment si is already an edge of Ti. Otherwise Ti is attained from Ti - 1 by adding segment si and removing one of the adjacent edges, which closes a cycle with si. We choose to remove the edge which is incident to the vertex with the highest degree. Figure [\ref=fig:overview] f) shows Tn. It is clear that Tn is an encompassing PSLG which is a tree as a graph and contains all the given line segments. It remains to show that it has max degree 3. Let us consider a line segment si. Clearly, if si already belonged to Ti - 1 the endpoints have max degree 3. Otherwise we note that one of the endpoints u has max degree 2 and the other v has max degree 3 in Ti - 1. When we add si both u and v have max degree 3 and 4 respectively and we close some cycle, which contains an edge incident to u and another incident to v. If v had indeed degree 4 we would have remove that edge and v has degree 3. Thus both have max degree 3 in Ti and henceforth max degree 3 in Tn.
