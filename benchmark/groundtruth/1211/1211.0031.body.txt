Embedding Groups into Distributive Subsets of the Monoid of Binary Operations

February 2012- October 2012

Introduction

Let X be a set and Bin(X) the set of all binary operations on X. We say that S  ⊂  Bin(X) is a distributive set of operations if all pairs of elements *  α, * β∈S are right distributive, that is, (a * αb) * βc = (a * βc) * α(b * βc) (we allow *  α =  * β). (X;S) is called a multi-shelf in this case. It was observed in [\cite=Prz-1] (compare also [\cite=Ro-S]) that Bin(X) is a monoid with composition *  1  *  2 given by a * 1  *  2b = (a * 1b) * 2b, with the identity *  0 being the right trivial operation, that is, a * 0b = a for any a,b∈X.

The submonoid of Bin(X) of all invertible elements in Bin(X) is a group denoted by Bininv(X). If *  ∈Bininv(X) then *  - 1 is usually denoted by [formula].

We say that a subset S  ⊂  Bin(X) is a distributive set if all pairs of elements *  α, * β∈S are right distributive, that is, (a * αb) * βc = (a * βc) * α(b * βc) (we allow *  α =  * β).

The following important basic lemma was proven in [\cite=Prz-1]:

If S is a distributive set and *  ∈S is invertible, then [formula] is also a distributive set.

If S is a distributive set and M(S) is the monoid generated by S, then M(S) is a distributive monoid.

If S is a distributive set of invertible operations and G(S) is the group generated by S, then G(S) is a distributive group.

The question was asked by J.Przytycki which groups can be realized as distributive sets. Soon after the definition of a distributive submonoid of Bin(X) was given in [\cite=Prz-1], Michal Jablonowski, a graduate student at Gdask University, noticed that any distributive monoid whose elements are idempotent operations is commutative. We have:

([\cite=Prz-1])

Consider *  α, * β∈Bin(X) such that *  β is idempotent (a * βa = a) and distributive with respect to *  α. Then *  α and *  β commute. In particular:

If M is a distributive monoid and *  β∈M is an idempotent operation, then *  β is in the center of M.

A distributive monoid whose elements are idempotent operations is commutative.

We have: [formula].

A few months later Agata Jastrz ebska (also a graduate student at Gdask University) checked that any distributive group in Bininv(X) for |X|  ≤  5 is commutative.

The first noncommutative subgroup of Bin(X) (the group S3) was found in October of 2011 by Yosef Berman. Soon after Berman (with the help of Carl Hammarsten) constructed an embedding of a general dihedral group D2  ·  n in Bin(X) where X has 2n elements. The embedding of Berman φ:D2  ·  3  →  Bin(X) is given as follows: if X = {0,1,2,3,4,5} then the subgroup D2  ·  3  ⊂  Bin(X) is generated by the binary operations *  τ (reflection) and *  σ (a 3-cycle):

[formula]

where i * j is placed in the ith row and jth column, and D2  ·  3  =  {τ,σ | τστ  =  σ- 1}.

Regular distributive embedding

We now show that any group G can be embedded in Bin(X) for some X.

(Regular embedding) Every group G embeds in Bin(G). This embedding (monomorphism), φreg:G  →  Bin(G) sends g to *  g where a * gb = ab- 1gb.

(i) We check that the set {  *  g}g∈G is a distributive set. We have: (a * g1b) * g2c = (ab- 1g1b) * g2c = ab- 1g1bc- 1g2c, and

[formula]

(ii) Now we check that the map φreg is a monomorphism. Of course the image of the identity *  0 is the identity in Bin(G). Furthermore: a * g1g2b = ab- 1g1g2b, and a * g1  *  g2b = (a * g1b) * g2b = ab- 1g1bb- 1g2b = ab- 1g1g2b, as needed. We have proven that φreg is a homomorphism. To show that φreg is a monomorphism we substitute b = 1 in the formula for a * gb, to get a * g1 = ag, so different g's give different binary operations in Bin(G). Notice that φreg(g- 1)  =  g.

We call our embedding regular by analogy to the regular representation of a group. We do not claim that the regular embedding is minimal. In fact, finding minimal distributive embeddings is a very interesting problem in itself.

General conditions for a distributive embedding

We now discuss a method that can be used to embed groups into subsets of Bininv(X) satisfying a given condition. We then use this method when the condition is right distributivity, which led us to discover the regular distributive embedding of G in Bin(G), and also should be a natural tool to look for minimal embeddings. For the group S3 we know, by Jastrzebska's calculations, that X with six elements is the minimal set such that S3 embeds in Bin(X).

We start from the following basic observation:

There is an isomorphism between Bininv(X) and S|X|X, where |X| is the cardinality of |X| and SX is the group of permutation on set X ( i.e. bijections of the set X). The isomorphism α:Bininv(X)  →  S|X|X  =  Πy∈XSyX is described as follows: α( * )(y):X  →  X is the bijection where (α( * )(y))(x) = x * y. In other words α( * )(y) is the bijection corresponding to the y coordinate of S|X|X.

Using the map α, we can translate conditions on a set of binary operations in Bin(X) into a group-theoretic condition on (coordinates of) elements of S|X|X. With some work, we can use this to find an embedding of a group into Bin(X). This is possible since the group axioms require that such an embedding sits inside Bininv(X). Let us consider distributive, invertible sets S of binary operations in Bininv(X). These are subsets S  ⊆  Bininv(X) that satisfy:

[formula]

Let σi,y = pyα( * i), where py:S|X|X  →  SX is projection onto the yth coordinate. Then translating the distributivity condition via α:

[formula]

or

[formula]

which leads to

[formula]

Now the problem of embedding a group into Bininv(X) is reduced to finding subsets of S|X|X isomorphic to the group that satisfy the condition above. We can then use tools of group theory (e.g., representation theory) to solve the problem. This process can by attempted for subsets of Bininv(X) satisfying any condition, and led to the embedding defined in the previous section for distributive subsets.

Future directions; multi-term homology

Przytycki defined multi-term homology for any distributive set in [\cite=Prz-1]. This provided motivation to have examples of distributive sets. The regular embedding of a group (Theorem [\ref=Theorem_1]) provides an interesting family of distributive sets ripe for studying this homology (compare [\cite=CPP] [\cite=Prz-1] [\cite=Prz-2] [\cite=Pr-Pu] [\cite=P-S]). As a nontrivial example we propose computing n-term distributive homology related with the regular embedding of the cyclic group Zn. Another problem related to Theorem [\ref=Theorem_1] is which monoids are distributive submonoids of Bin(X).

A key motivation is to use multi-term distributive homology in knot theory. This possibility arises from the relation of the third Reidemeister move with right distributivity (and eventually the Yang-Baxter operator), and the important work of Carter, Kamada, Saito, and other researchers on applications of quandle homology to knot theory (see [\cite=CKS]).
