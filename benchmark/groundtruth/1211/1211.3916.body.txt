Understanding the Last Mile - Physics of the Accretion Column

Introduction

Accreting X-ray pulsars exist in binary systems, where a companion star transfers matter to the neutron star via Roche lobe overflow, a strong stellar wind or a Be outflow disk, [\cite=FKR:2002]. The sizes of these systems vary widely, generally in the range 106 to 108 km.

Independently of the way matter is transferred, close to the compact object the flow of matter is dominated by the strong magnetic field [formula] G. The accreting plasma couples to the magnetic field lines at the Alvén radius, which is a few 1000 km for typical neutron star parameters (see, e.g., [\cite=CaballeroWilms:2012] and references therein). The infalling matter follows the magnetic field lines, forming accretion columns on the neutron star magnetic poles with a surface area of ~  1 km2 and a height that can range from meters to many km.

The observed X-ray spectra are usually relatively simple and broadly similar across sources. They are normally well described by a power law with exponential cutoff, affected by absorption and including iron fluorescence lines which are produced within the binary system, as well close as far away from the X-ray source. In some accreting X-ray pulsars, broad absorption-like features are observed which are caused by resonant scattering of photons on electrons whose energies are quantized into so-called Landau levels, spaced by

[formula]

For an overview of known cyclotron line sources see [\cite=CaballeroWilms:2012].

For bright accreting X-ray pulsars [\cite=BeckerWolff:2007] have developed a model of the continuum spectra, where the total observed spectrum is a result of the bulk and thermal Comptonization of bremstrahlung, black body and cyclotron seed photons. This model has been adapted to xspec and used for analysis of 4U 0115+63 by [\cite=Ferrigno:2009].

Cyclotron line features are still usually fitted phenomenologically with independent Gaussian or Lorentzian line shapes. A more physical approach to model the complex harmonic cyclotron line shapes simultaneously has been pursued by [\cite=Schoenherr:2007]: Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations of the cyclotron resonant scattering on a large parameter grid (following [\cite=Araya:1999]) have been used to create a Green's function based xspec convolution model, applicable to any continuum and successfully applied to spectra of different sources, e.g., by [\cite=Suchy:2008a].

In contrast to the spectra, the pulse profiles - light curves folded by the pulse period - can be quite unique for a given source, with the typical shape serving almost as a 'fingerprint'. The profiles are usually quite dependent on the energy band, with a common tendency to have simpler profiles at higher energies. In some sources these energy-dependent profiles are very stable across significant brightness variations, in other cases a clear evolution is visible and occasionally rather chaotic changes have been observed [\cite=Camero-Arranz:2007]. What drives these different modes of behaviour is still not well understood.

Recent Results

Pulse profile modeling

[\cite=Caballero:2011] and [\cite=Sasaki:2012] have applied methods developed by [\cite=Kraus:95] in order to decompose the pulse profiles of the sources A 0535+26, 4U 0115+63 and V 0332+53. In this approach axisymmetrical emission and the same beam pattern is assumed for both poles, but the poles can be offset from antipodal. The observed profiles can be explained within these models including emission from the accretion column a halo around the footpoint of the column as well as scattering of photons in the upper accretion stream. The change of emission geometry during a giant outburst of V 0332+53 could be demonstrated by [\cite=Sasaki:2012].

Cyclotron line energy variations

For some of the sources with cyclotron lines the derived line energies have been found to vary as a function of luminosity, see, e.g., [\cite=Mowlavi:2006], [\cite=Tsygankov:2007], [\cite=Staubert:2007], or [\cite=Klochkov:2011a]. The data point towards two types of variability: for certain sources, (e.g., V 0332+53) the centroid energy correlates negatively with the luminosity, for others (e.g., Her X-1) a positive correlation is observed, while for some sources (e.g., A 0535+26) the line appears to be at constant energies (within uncertainties) despite significant luminosity changes. A possible explanation has been developed by [\cite=Becker:2012] who describe different accretion regimes based on the definition of a critical luminosity Lcrit  =  1.5  ×  1037(B / 1012  G) above which radiation pressure decelerates the matter to rest. The brightest sources ("supercritical", i.e., LX > Lcrit), will have an accretion column where the characteristic emission height increases with luminosity and the observed B field decreases accordingly. In subcritical sources, somewhat below Lcrit, Coulomb braking will be dominant and increased luminosity leads to a decreasing emission height and increasing observed B field. At even lower luminosities no significant evolution is expected. This model agrees well with the observed source behaviour and parameters, for details see [\cite=Becker:2012].

Accretion mound stability and variations with pulse phase

A common feature of cyclotron line sources is that the observed line energy varies with pulse phase. While a variation with angle is expected if one includes relativistic corrections, the observed variations are often larger than those predicted straightforwardly.

[\cite=MukherjeeBhattacharya:2012] and colleagues have studied the stability of accretion mounds and the distribution of the magnetic field in the mound. For mounds of a total accreted mass of [formula] there is an appreciable distortion of the magnetic field with a stronger relative field towards the rim of the mound. This distortion would have a strong signature in the observed spectra if mound surface were visible directly. In the 2D MHD simulations ballooning instabilities develop which limit the maximum height of the mound and the amount of matter that can be contained. Beyond [formula] the mounds become unstable.

New developments

In order to progress significantly beyond the efforts described above, a challenging overall problem needs to be tackled: For each pole the X-ray continuum production needs to be modeled as function of energy and position in the column. This emission is further significantly modified by cyclotron resonant scattering strongly dependent on energy and angle of photon propagation. To describe the observed spectra or pulse profiles the emission from both poles must be combined using realistic emission geometries and including relativistic light bending around the neutron star.

As one step in this process, members of our collaboration are further developing the Green's function models of cyclotron line scattering processes ([\cite=Schoenherr:COSPAR2012], [\cite=Schwarm:IWS2012]). Compared to previous approaches (e.g., [\cite=Araya:1999]) much more general geometries are being implemented, allowing the adaption to light-bending models for the effectively visible emission. This work is cross-checked with other approaches, see, e.g., [\cite=Nishimura:2008].

In parallel an effort is ongoing to combine the modeling efforts of [\cite=BeckerWolff:2007] and [\cite=Becker:2012] with the advanced cyclotron line scattering description. In this 'hybrid' approach, column properties and seed photons are derived from the continuum models, which get modified in an outer 'sheath' by the advanced cyclotron scattering models. An additional component in this effort is the inclusion of ray tracing within a general relativistic geometry in order to describe the corresponding modifications to the observed spectra.

The structure of accretion mounds is further studied in 3D MHD simulations by [\cite=MukherjeeBhattacharyaMignone:201X]. First results indicate an easy excitation of the fluting mode instability and consequent transport of matter across the field. This would reduce the maximum mass supported within the mounds and field distortions would be on small scales.

Summary

In recent years significant progress has been made on various fronts in the understanding of the physics of accretion columns in X-ray pulsars. These developments have been possible due to improved methods and advances in computing power. The results are encouraging, but also demonstrate the complexity of the issues which have to be taken into account.

Within our collaboration work is now ongoing to improve the existing models and to combine different approaches in order to provide detailed predictions for direct comparison with the rich observational dataset.
