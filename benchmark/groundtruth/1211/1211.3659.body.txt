Color scales that are effective in both color and grayscale

It is often desirable to present quantitative results in both color and grayscale formats. In the black-and-white or grayscale format, an interval of numerical values maps to a scale of grays which increase uniformly in lightness. Color is usually represented as a three-dimensional object, and could thus be used to represent a three-dimensional region of numerical values. More typically, a color scale is used to represent a one-dimensional interval of numerical values. Colors are usually easier to distinguish than grays because of the additional dimensions along which colors vary. Thus a color scale is generally preferable to a grayscale.

However, black and white printing is less costly than color printing, so it is useful to be able to print color images in black and white and obtain readable images. Such images are also readable by those with some degree of color blindness, which includes about 10% of males and a much smaller percentage of females.

A color can be defined in different ways. Here we use the common RGB color model [\cite=plataniotis2000color] [\cite=kang2006computational]. A color is defined by a three-component vector,

, so a color corresponds to a point in the unit cube, 3, in RGB space. For example, pure red is

Colors can also be represented in terms of three other quantities: hue, chroma, and intensity. We define

Here L is the middle of the components in order of magnitude. The chroma C is

and represents the colorfulness of a given color. For the pure colors already mentioned C  =  1, and C  =  0 for any shade of gray. Hue is a cyclical quantity, represented by angles θ ranging from 0 to 360 degrees. Hue is defined piecewise:

[formula]

Red corresponds to 0 (and 360) degrees, green to 120 degrees, and blue to 240 degrees. At intermediate angles we have intermediate colors: at 60 degrees is pure yellow (

[formula]

), and at 300 degrees is pure magenta (

, to obtain good hue resolution with the color scale. Fourth, the hues should increase or decrease monotonically over the whole color scale to make the colors easy to identify uniquely by avoiding replication of hues. We further assume that the hues should increase or decrease linearly in the color scale. This assumption is perhaps less necessary than linear variation of intensity, but it simplifies our calculations by restricting the range of possible color scales to a low-dimensional space. Also, the chroma of the color scale should be as large as possible on average, to make colors less gray and thus easier to distinguish. With these properties and assumptions, a color scale is represented by curves in both the R,G,B and θ,C,I spaces. As a curve parametrized by s, 0  ≤  s  ≤  1 in (θ,C,I)-space, the color scale satisfies

[formula]

With these choices for θ and I, C is chosen to be as large as possible on average. By ([\ref=theta]), the set of colors with a given hue (i.e. θ) is the intersection of a plane with the R,G,B cube. The set of R,G,B with a given I is also the intersection of the plane ([\ref=I]) with the R,G,B cube. The intersection of these planes is a straight line, on which C varies. C is a linear function of M and m, and for a given hue, a linear function of R,G, and B also. Thus the maximum of C occurs at one of the end points of the line, at the boundaries of the cube. On the boundaries of the cube, either m = 0 or M = 1 (or both). To determine which of m = 0 or M = 1 holds, we consider the following facts. If the hue is fixed, then by ([\ref=theta]) so is the ratio (L - m) / (M - m)  =  k. Imagine we set m = 0 and increase both L and M from zero, keeping the ratio (L - m) / (M - m)  =  L / M fixed and equal to k. Then the chroma and intensity both increase monotonically for a fixed hue. The chroma has its maximum when m  =  0,M  =  1, and L  =  k. Now imagine we set M = 1 and decrease both L and m from 1, keeping the ratio (L - m) / (M - m)  =  (L - m) / (1 - m) fixed and equal to k. The chroma increases monotonically while the intensity decreases monotonically. The chroma again has its maximum when m  =  0,M  =  1, and L  =  k. Thus the set of points of a given hue and either m  =  0 and M  =  1 is a union of two intervals which meet at a common point with m  =  0,M  =  1, and L  =  k. The intensity increases monotonically on this interval and thus equals a given intensity I exactly once. If we know both the hue θ and the intensity I, we can determine m,L, and M at this point, and also R,G,B. We proceed as follows. We use the hue to find k since R,G,B correspond uniquely to m,L, and M for a given hue. Let I0 be the intensity when m  =  0,M  =  1, and L  =  k. If I  ≤  I0, we set m  =  0 and find L and M by solving the two equations ([\ref=I]) and (L - m) / (M - m)  =  k for the two unknowns L and M. Knowing the hue, we first express ([\ref=I]) in terms of m,L, and M. If I  >  I0, we set M  =  1 and find m and L by solving the same two equations. In this way we obtain the unique m, L, and M with a given k and I and with either m = 0 and M = 1. This is the same as the point with a given hue and intensity for which the chroma is maximized. Having m, L, and M, and knowing the hue, we can obtain R, G, and B.

Once we have defined θi, θf, Imin and Imax, the preceding algorithm defines a color scale. A simple choice is to use the full ranges of hues and intensities. We also use slightly less than the full ranges to see how the optimal color scales are affected. The range of hues can be traversed in either the direction of increasing or decreasing θ. Thus we use θf  -  θi  =    ±  360, as well as the slightly smaller ranges θf  -  θi  =    ±  300 for comparison. For the intensity range, we use Imin  =  0 or 0.1 and Imax  =  0.9 or 1. These four hue ranges and four intensity ranges yield 16 combinations. For each combination, we vary θi over
