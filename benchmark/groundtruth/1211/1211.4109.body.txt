A geometric inequality on hypersurface in hyperbolic space

Introduction

The classical Alexandrov-Fenchel inequalities for closed convex hypersurface [formula] state that

[formula]

where σm(κ) is the m-th elementary symmetric polynomial of the principal curvatures [formula] of Σ and [formula] is a constant. When m = 0, [\eqref=eq1-1] is interpreted as the classical isoperimetric inequality

[formula]

which holds on all bounded domain [formula] with boundary Σ  =  ∂Ω. Here |Σ| is the area Σ and n is a constant depending only on dimension n. Inequality [\eqref=eq1-1] was generalized to star-shaped and m-convex hypersurface [formula] by Guan and Li [\cite=GL] using the inverse curvature flow recently, where m-convex means that the principal curvature of Σ lies in the Garding's cone Recently, Huisken [\cite=Hu1] showed that in the case m = 1, the assumption star-shaped can be replaced by outward-minimizing.

In this paper, we consider the hyperbolic space [formula] endowed with the metric where [formula] is the standard round metric on the unit sphere [formula]. It's a natural question to establish some analogue inequalities of [\eqref=eq1-1] for closed hypersurface in [formula]. In the case of m = 1, σ1  =  σ1(κ) is just the mean curvature H of Σ. Gallego and Solanes [\cite=GS] have obtained a generalization of [\eqref=eq1-1] to convex hypersurface in hyperbolic space using integral geometric methods, however, their result does not seem to be sharp. Denoting λ(r) =  sinh r, then λ'(r) =  cosh r. Recently, Brendle,Hung and Wang [\cite=BHW] proved the following inequality for star-shaped and mean convex (i.e.,H > 0) hypersurface [formula]:

[formula]

where |Σ| is the area of Σ and ωn - 1 is the area of the unit sphere [formula]. de Lima and Girao [\cite=LimaG] also proved the following related inequality independently.

[formula]

Both inequalities [\eqref=eq1-3] and [\eqref=eq1-2] are sharp in the sense of that equality holds if and only if Σ is a geodesic sphere centered at the origin. Here, we say a closed hypersurface [formula] is star-shaped if the unit outward normal ν satisfies 〈ν,∂r〉 > 0 everywhere on Σ, which is also equivalent to that Σ can be parametrized by a graph for some smooth function r on [formula]. We note that inequalities [\eqref=eq1-3] and [\eqref=eq1-2] have some applications in general relativity, see [\cite=BHW] [\cite=LimaG] [\cite=W].

In this paper, we consider the case m = 2. We prove the following sharp inequality for star-shaped and two-convex hypersurface [formula], where two-convex means that the principal curvature lies in the Garding's cone Γ2 everywhere on Σ.

If [formula] is a star-shaped and two-convex hypersurface, then

[formula]

where ωn - 1 is the area of the unit sphere [formula] and |Σ| is the area of Σ. The equality holds if and only if Σ is a geodesic sphere.

Note that there exists at least one elliptic point on a closed, connected hypersurface Σ in hyperbolic space [formula]. Proposition 3.2 in [\cite=BC] shows that if σ2 is positive, then σ1 is automatically positive. So our assumption two-convex can also be replaced by σ2 > 0 on Σ.

The proof of Theorem [\ref=mainthm] follows a similar argument as in [\cite=BHW] [\cite=GL] [\cite=LimaG]. We evolve Σ by a special case of the inverse curvature flow in [\cite=Ge], and consider the following quantity defined by

[formula]

We show that Q(t) is monotone decreasing under the flow. Then we use the convergence result of the flow proved by Gerhardt to estimate a lower bound of the limit of Q(t):

[formula]

In order to estimate this lim inf , we also use a sharp version Sobolev inequality on [formula] due to Beckner [\cite=Be] as in [\cite=BHW]. Finally Theorem [\ref=mainthm] follows easily from the monotonicity and the lower bound of lim inf t  →    ∞Q(t).

Preliminaries

Let [formula] be a closed hypersurface with unit outward normal ν. The second fundamental form h of Σ is defined by for any two tangent fields X,Y. The principal curvature [formula] are the eigenvalues of h with respect to the induced metric g on Σ. For 1  ≤  m  ≤  n - 1, the m-th elementary symmetric polynomial of κ is defined as which can also be viewed as function of the second fundamental form hji = gjkhki. In the sequel, we will simply write σm for σm(κ). We first collect the following basic facts on σm (see, e.g,[\cite=HLP] [\cite=Hu2] [\cite=Re]):

Denote [formula] and (h2)ji = gjlgpkhklhip. We have

[formula]

Moreover, if κ∈Γ+m, we have the following Newton-MacLaurin inequalities

[formula]

and the equalities hold in [\eqref=eq2-2],[\eqref=eq2-3] at a given point if and only if Σ is umbilical there.

We now evolve [formula] by the following evolution equation

[formula]

where ν is the unit outward normal to Σt = X(t,  ·  ) and F is the speed function which may depend on the position vector, principal curvatures and time. Let gij be the induced metric and dμt be its area element on Σt. We have the following evolution equations.

Under the flow [\eqref=evolu], we have:

[formula]

The first four equations follow from direct computations like in [\cite=Hu]. Now we calculate the evolution of σm (cf. [\cite=GL])

[formula]

where in the last equality we used [\eqref=eq2-0],[\eqref=eq2-1] and the divergence free property of (Tm - 1)ij (see [\cite=Re]).

Under the flow [\eqref=evolu], we have

[formula]

This proposition follows directly from [\eqref=eq2-4], [\eqref=eq2-5] and the divergence theorem.

In [\cite=Ge] Gerhardt studied general inverse curvature flow of star-shaped hypersurface in hyperbolic space. For our purpose, we will use a special case of their result for the following flow

[formula]

If the initial hypersurface is star-shaped and strictly two-convex, then the solution for the flow [\eqref=evolu-1] exists for all time t > 0 and the flow hypersurfaces converge to infinity while maintaining star-shapedness and strictly two-convex. Moreover, the hypersurfaces become strictly convex exponentially fast and more and more totally umbilical in the sense of i.e., the principal curvatures are uniformly bounded and converge exponentially fast to one.

Monotonicity

We define the quantity

[formula]

where |Σt| is the area of Σt. In this section, we show that Q(t) is monotone decreasing along the flow [\eqref=evolu-1].

Under the flow [\eqref=evolu-1], the quantity Q(t) is monotone decreasing. Moreover, [formula] at some time t if and only if the surface Σt is totally umbilical.

Under the flow [\eqref=evolu-1], Proposition [\ref=prop2-3] and [\eqref=eq2-4] imply that

[formula]

Combining [\eqref=eq3-1], [\eqref=eq3-2] and [\eqref=eq2-2], we have

[formula]

By applying the Newton-MacLaurin inequality [\eqref=eq2-3] in [\eqref=eq3-2], we also have

[formula]

Then combining [\eqref=eq3-3] and [\eqref=eq3-4] gives that

[formula]

From Proposition [\ref=prop4-2] in the next section and [\eqref=eq3-5], we know that the quantity is nonnegative along the flow [\eqref=evolu-1]. Then inequalities [\eqref=eq3-4] and [\eqref=eq3-5] implies that

[formula]

If the equality holds, the inequalities [\eqref=eq2-2] and [\eqref=eq2-3] assume equalities everywhere on Σt. Then Σt is totally umbilical.

The asymptotic behavior of monotone quantity

In this section, we use the convergence result of the flow [\eqref=evolu-1] proved in [\cite=Ge] to estimate the lower bound of the limit of Q(t). First we need the following sharp Sobolev inequality on [formula] ([\cite=Be]).

For every positive function f on [formula], we have

[formula]

Moreover, equality holds if and only if f is a constant.

From Theorem 4 in [\cite=Be], for any positive smooth function w on [formula], we have the following inequalty

[formula]

Moreover equality holds if and only if w is constant. For any positive function f on [formula], by letting [formula], we have

[formula]

and equality holds if and only if f is a constant.

Under the flow [\eqref=evolu-1], we have

[formula]

Recall that star-shaped hypersurfaces can be written as graphs of function [formula]. Denote λ(r) =  sinh (r), then λ'(r) =  cosh (r). We next define a function φ on [formula] by φ(θ) = Φ(r(θ)), where Φ(r) is a positive function satisfying Φ' = 1 / λ. Let [formula] be a coordinate system on [formula] and φi,φij be the covariant derivatives of φ with respect to the metric [formula]. Define From [\cite=Ge], we know that

[formula]

Since [formula], we have

[formula]

From [\eqref=eq4-1] we also have

[formula]

In terms of φ, we can express the metric and second fundamental form of Σ as following (see, e.g, [\cite=BHW] [\cite=Ding])

[formula]

where [formula]. Denote [formula] and note that [formula]. By [\eqref=eq4-1], the principal curvatures of Σt has the following form Then we have

[formula]

By using [\eqref=eq4-3] and [\eqref=eq4-2],

[formula]

On the other hand,

[formula]

So we have

[formula]

Since [formula], by using [\eqref=eq4-3], we deduce that

[formula]

Moreover,

[formula]

Using Lemma [\ref=lem4-1], we can complete the proof of Proposition [\ref=prop4-2] by combining [\eqref=eq4-4] and [\eqref=eq4-5].

We now complete the proof of Theorem [\ref=mainthm]

Since Q(t) is monotone decreasing, we have

[formula]

This gives that the initial hypersurface Σ satisfies

[formula]

which is equivalent to the inequality [\eqref=maineq] in Theorem [\ref=mainthm]. Now we assume that equality holds in [\eqref=maineq], which implies that Q(t) is a constant. Then Proposition [\ref=mono] implies Σt is umbilical and therefore a geodesic sphere. It is also easy to see that if Σ is a geodesic sphere of radius r, then the area of Σ is |Σ| = ωn - 1 sinh n - 1r and the integral of σ2 is

[formula]

Hence the equality holds in [\eqref=maineq] on a geodesic sphere. This completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=mainthm].
