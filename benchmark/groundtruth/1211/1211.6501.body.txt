A Fourier restriction theorem based on convolution powers

Introduction

Let F be the Fourier transform defined on the Schwartz space by

[formula]

where 〈ξ,x〉 is the Euclidean inner product. We are interested in Borel measures μ defined on [formula] for which F maps [formula] boundedly to L2(μ); i.e.

[formula]

Here "[formula]" means the left-hand side is bounded by the right-hand side multiplied by a positive constant that is independent of f.

If μ is a singular measure, then such result can be interpreted as a restriction property of the Fourier transform. Such restriction estimates for singular measures were first obtained by Stein in the 1960's. If μ is the surface measure on the sphere, the Stein-Tomas theorem [\cite=tomas], [\cite=stein] states that [\eqref=restriction] holds for [formula]. Mockenhaupt [\cite=mockenhaupt] and Mitsis [\cite=mitsis] have shown that Tomas's argument in [\cite=tomas] can be used to obtain an L2-Fourier restriction theorem for a general class of finite Borel measures satisfying

[formula]

[formula]

where 0 < α,β < d; they showed that [\eqref=restriction] holds for [formula]. Bak and Seeger [\cite=bak-seeger] proved the same result for the endpoint p0 and further strengthened it by replacing the Lp0-norm with the Lp0,2-Lorentz norm.

It is well known that if μ is the surface measure on a compact C∞ manifold then the sharpness can be tested by some version of Knapp's homogeneity argument. See e.g. the work by Iosevich and Lu [\cite=iosevich-lu] who proved that if μ is the surface measure on a compact hypersurface and if F:Lp0  →  L2(μ), [formula], then the Fourier decay assumption [\eqref=fourier] is satisfied with α = d - 1. For general measures satisfying [\eqref=fourier] and [\eqref=ahlfors], there is no Knapp's argument available to prove the sharpness of p0. Here we show that indeed for certain measures the restriction estimate [\eqref=restriction] holds in a range of p beyond the range given above. This will follow from a restriction estimate based on an assumption on the n-fold convolution [formula].

Let μ be a Borel probability measure on [formula], let 1  ≤  r  ≤    ∞   and assume that [formula]. Let [formula], if r  ≥  2 and [formula], if 1  ≤  r  ≤  2, and let [formula]. Then

[formula]

Apply Theorem [\ref=theorem] with n = 2, r =   ∞  , one obtains the following.

Let μ be a Borel probability measure on [formula] such that [formula]. Then [\eqref=restriction] holds for 1  ≤  p  ≤  4 / 3.

Remarks. (i) It is not easy to construct measures supported on lower dimensional sets for which Corollary [\ref=corollary] applies. Remarkably, Körner showed by a combination of Baire category and probabilistic argument that there exist "many" Borel probability measures μ supported on compact sets of Hausdorff dimension 1/2 so that [formula].

(ii) In Corollary [\ref=corollary], since [formula] satisfies [\eqref=ahlfors] with α = 1, μ satisfies [\eqref=ahlfors] with α = 1 / 2 (see Proposition [\ref=convolution-ahlfors]). Suppose μ is supported on a compact set of Hausdorff dimension γ. It follows that γ  ≥  1 / 2 (cf. [\cite=wolff], Proposition 8.2). Furthermore, if γ  <  1, then β and α in [\eqref=fourier] and [\eqref=ahlfors] can not exceed γ (cf. [\cite=wolff], Corollary 8.7).

(iii) Under the above situation, since α,β  ≤  γ, the range of p in [\eqref=restriction] obtained from [\cite=mockenhaupt], [\cite=mitsis], [\cite=bak-seeger] is no larger than [formula] where ε  =  γ - 1 / 2, while Corollary [\ref=corollary] gives the range 1  ≤  p  ≤  4 / 3, which is an improvement if γ < 2 / 3. However, we do not know any example of such a measure μ with β (and α) close to γ.

(iv) Suppose μ is as in Corollary [\ref=corollary] and supported on a compact set of Hausdorff dimension 1/2. By Theorem [\ref=theorem], the restriction estimate [\eqref=q-restriction] holds for 1  ≤  p  ≤  4 / 3, 1  ≤  q  ≤  p' / 2. By dimensionality considerations (see Proposition [\ref=average-fourier] and Proposition [\ref=knapp]), these are all the possible exponents 1  ≤  p,q  ≤    ∞   for which [\eqref=q-restriction] holds.

Proof of theorem [\ref=theorem]

The proof proceeds in a similar spirit as in [\cite=rudin], [\cite=fefferman]. Fix a nonnegative function [formula] that satisfies [formula]. Let φε(ξ) = ε- dφ(ξ  /  ε) and [formula]. Since με converges weakly to μ, we have

[formula]

for all [formula]. Thus it suffices to show

[formula]

where C is a constant independent of f and ε. By Hölder's inequality, we may assume [formula]. Set s = p' / n. Note that by our assumption on the range of p, [formula]. By duality, we need to prove

[formula]

for all bounded Borel function g. By the Hausdorff-Young inequality,

[formula]

where [formula], [formula],

[formula]

Now by Hölder's inequality for the inner integral,

[formula]

Apply Hölder's inequality again, this is bounded by

[formula]

where we have used Young's inequality in the last line. Since [formula], we obtain [\eqref=dual] after taking the nth root.

Appendix

For the sake of completeness, we include the proofs of the claims made in the remarks. Similar results can be found in [\cite=mockenhaupt] and [\cite=mitsis].

Let μ be a Borel probability measure on [formula]. If μ* n satisfies [\eqref=ahlfors] with 0  ≤  α  ≤  d, then μ satisfies [\eqref=ahlfors] with exponent α / n.

Assume to the contrary that given k, μ(Brk)  ≥  krα / nk for some ball Brk with radius rk > 0. Let [formula] be the n-fold Minkowski sum, then

[formula]

On the other hand, since μ* n satisfies [\eqref=ahlfors],

[formula]

Let k  →    ∞  , we obtain a contradiction.

Let μ be a Borel probability measure on [formula] supported on a compact set of Hausdorff dimension 0  ≤  γ < d, then

[formula]

Assume to the contrary that [formula] for some 2 < s < 2d / γ. Then

[formula]

This decay in R  →    ∞   implies γ  ≥  2d / s (cf. [\cite=wolff], Corollary 8.7). Since 2d / s > γ, we obtain a contradiction.

For the endpoint [formula] we have

Let μ be a Borel probability measure on [formula] supported on a compact set K. Suppose d / 2  ≤  γ < d and there exists C  ≥  1 so that

[formula]

for all x∈K and 0 < r < 1. Then [formula].

Assume to the contrary that [formula]. Let [formula] be the reflection of μ, i.e. (A) = μ( - A) for Borel sets A. Then  = ||2∈Ld / γ. By the Hausdorff-Young inequality, this implies [formula], and hence

[formula]

On the other hand, by the upper regularity assumption in [\eqref=AD] we can find Nε many disjoint balls Bj of radius ε / 2 centered in K with [formula]. Since the difference set Bj - Bj  ⊂  B(0,ε), we have

[formula]

where we have used the lower regularity assumption in [\eqref=AD] in the second inequality. Compare this with [\eqref=ballholder] and notice that [formula] as ε  →  0, we obtain a contradiction.

Let μ be a Borel probability measure on [formula] supported on a compact set of Hausdorff dimension 0 < γ  ≤  d. If [\eqref=q-restriction] holds with 1  ≤  p,q  ≤    ∞  , then [formula].

Given ε > 0, by Billingsley's lemma (cf. [\cite=falconer], Proposition 4.9), there exist [formula] and rk  →  0 such that [formula]. For our purpose, we may assume x0 = 0. Pick a bump function φ at 0 and let   =  φ(  ·   / rk) in [\eqref=q-restriction], we obtain [formula]. Comparing the powers then gives the desired result.

Additional remarks

(i) After submission of this paper, Hambrook and L aba posted a preprint [\cite=hambrook-laba] in which they provide examples of Cantor-type measures for which the range obtained from [\cite=bak-seeger] is sharp. (ii) If μ is as in Corollary [\ref=corollary] with compact support, then by Proposition [\ref=reflection] it can not have lower regularity as in [\eqref=AD] of degree 1/2. (iii) As pointed out by the referee, Corollary [\ref=corollary] also follows from

[formula]

which can be obtained by interpolating the cases p = 1,p =   ∞  . See also Bak and McMichael [\cite=bak-mcmichael], Iosevich and Roudenko [\cite=iosevich-roudenko].
