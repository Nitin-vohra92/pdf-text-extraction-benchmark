Proton and Neutron Irradiation Tests of Readout Electronics of the ATLAS Hadronic Endcap Calorimeter

Introduction

electronics for the Hadronic Endcap Calorimeter (HEC) [\cite=art:HEC] of the ATLAS Experiment [\cite=art:ATLAS] has been designed to withstand ten years of operation of the LHC at center-of-mass energies of [formula] with peak luminosities of L  =  1034  cm- 2  s- 1 corresponding to an integrated luminosity of [formula]. The foreseen upgrade to the high-luminosity version of the LHC (HL-LHC) exceeds these limits by up to an order of magnitude. The expected radiation levels for integrated luminosities of 3000  fb- 1 in the region of the amplifier electronics located inside the cryostat of the HEC are [formula] for hadrons above 20  MeV, including safety factors of 5 in total to account for simulation uncertainties, while the corresponding number for [formula] equivalent neutrons in silicon is 4.1  ×  1014n  /  cm2, about an order of magnitude larger. The expected total ionization dose (again evaluated for silicon and including the same safety factor of 5) is 6.2  kGy. Proton and neutron irradiation tests have been performed to evaluate the limits of the current readout electronics under HL-LHC conditions.

In addition to the in-situ measurements during the irradiation which took place at room temperature, the neutron irradiated boards were re-measured 3 months after the neutron tests, immersed in liquid nitrogen to simulate the conditions inside the ATLAS endcap cryostat where the readout electronics of the HEC are located.

Proton Tests

A 198.9  MeV proton beam of 2.71  nA at the Proton Irradiation Facility (PIF) at PSI with a narrow beam profile of σx≃7  mm and σy≃9  mm at the position of the devices under test has been used to evaluate the radiation hardness against hadrons up to a fluence of [formula] after 22.05  h of beam time. A mount with 14 equidistant slots with a slot spacing of 1.7  cm has been placed in the beam line. The 6 boards closest to the beam window housed transistors in SiGe bipolar and Si CMOS FET technology and the GaAs FET based ASICs (BB96) [\cite=art:BB96]. The BB96 ASICs are currently used in ATLAS for the HEC readout. Slots 7 and 14 were equipped with radiation diodes for dose measurements, and slots 8 - 13 with test structures for the HEC power supplies. A picture of the setup prior to final alignment is shown in Figure [\ref=fig:PIF_setup].

The beam position and width has been measured with sheets of EBT2 radiation film placed for 5  minutes in the beam at 6 different positions. The total beam flux was measured and calibrated by the PIF group with ionization chambers. The raw ionization chamber current measurements in 1  s intervals and the conversion factor to the proton beam current was used to calculate the accumulated proton charge as function of time. Together with the beam width and position measurements from the radiation films the fluence for the devices under test in each slot could be derived. The alignment of the setup was done prior to irradiation by means of two lasers indicating the horizontal and vertical planes containing the beam direction. The laser system was however misaligned for the horizontal plane which led to an offset of [formula] in y, while the positioning of the boards themselves limited the precision in x to about ±  1  mm. Taking into account the small variations of the beam profile along the beam line, the offset of the beam in y, and the expected losses due to nuclear reactions in the devices under test, the flux was found to be the same for all slots.

Figure [\ref=fig:PIF_film_15] shows the horizontal and vertical profiles of the proton beam as measured by one of the radiation films. Dips in the data distribution are caused by the soldered legs of housings in the upstream slots. The superimposed Gaussian fits show that the profiles are roughly Gaussian in the area of the ASIC.

Neutron Tests

Neutron tests have been performed with a 12 - 14  μA and [formula] proton beam of the variable-energy cyclotron U-120 at NPI in Re z hitting a [formula] thick D2O target to produce a neutron spectrum with [formula] and [formula] [\cite=art:Bem]. Similar to the setup in the proton test, 16 equidistant slots with distances of 1.7  cm between adjacent board centers have been equipped and placed in front of the [formula] steel plate enclosing the target. The alignment was done prior to mounting the target and the test boards by burning small holes with the proton beam in two calibration boards placed instead of the test structures in the first and last slot. Slots 1-6, 8, and 9 were equipped with the BB96 GaAs ASICs, slots 7 and 11 with radiation diodes and activation foils and the remaining slots with test structures for the HEC power supplies. The setup is shown in Figure [\ref=fig:Rez_setup].

The total collected proton charge in the test was 2.0  C. The neutron flux profile has been measured with sheets of EBT2 radiation film placed for 5  minutes at a reduced machine current of 1.2  μA in front of slot 1 and behind all other slots with the exception of slots 7,10, and 11. During a dedicated fluence test run in 2010 with radiation monitors in each slot the following empirical relation of the [formula] equivalent neutron fluence in silicon and the machine current as function of the slot number has been found [\cite=art:Dannheim]:

[formula]

where slot is the slot-number (1-16), offset is the distance of the first slot from the target (3  mm) and the positions are known with [formula] precision.

Figure [\ref=fig:rez_fluence] shows this fluence curve superimposed by the relative fluence measurements from the radiation films, normalized to the expected fluence in slot 3.

S-Parameter Measurements

During the irradiation the scattering parameters (S-parameters) of the BB96 ASICs have been continuously measured to study their performance as a function of the fluence up the maximum value at the end of the irradiation. The S-parameters have been measured for the frequency range [formula] to [formula] with a vector network analyzer (VNA) connected via 40  m long cables to the devices under test. Each cable pair has been individually de-embedded with the VNA calibration utility moving the plane of calibration to the input connectors of the boards. The most important parameters are the input port reflection coefficient S11, which can be translated into the input impedance Zin  =  50  Ω  (1 + S11) / (1 - S11), for our case of vanishing feedback coefficient S12 and low load reflection, and the forward transmission coefficient S21. The product of the two gives the transimpedance gain in the frequency domain. This can be interpreted as the input current to output voltage signal amplification. It was found that the effect of protons in the GaAs ASICs is similar to that of neutrons with ~  5 times larger fluence. Since the expected ratio of neutron to proton fluence for the HL-LHC is ~  10, the neutron tests provide the most limiting numbers.

Pulse Measurements

In the neutron test triangular voltage pulses similar to the ionization currents in the LAr gaps in ATLAS with 10 different amplitudes between 0.7  mV and 70  mV and pulse lengths of 500  ns have been applied over the 40  m cables at the BB96 ASICs and both the input and the output pulse have been measured with an oscilloscope (the output pulse again after 40  m cable). These measurements were done alternatingly with the S-parameter measurements and provide a more direct way of studying the performance of the electronics. Good agreement with the S-parameter measurements was found for the gain as a function of neutron fluence. The largest expected ionization currents in ATLAS are 250  μA for a single pre-amplifier and about 500  μA for a full chain of several pre-amplifiers and one summing amplifier. Up to these values the linearity of the pre-amplifiers and the full system was measured with the pulses. To convert from input voltage pulses to currents the input impedance and cable damping is taken into account. Thus the voltage range of 0.7  mV to 70  mV corresponds to an input current range of 10  μA to 1000  μA for non-irradiated chips.

Warm In-situ Results

The forward transmission coefficient normalized to the value before irradiation and evaluated in the frequency range of the shaper electronics in ATLAS (4  MHz  <  f  <  10  MHz) as measured in situ for the full systems consisting of one pre-amplifier and a summing amplifier during the proton and neutron irradiations is shown in Figure [\ref=fig:S21_warm_SYS] as function of the proton and 1  MeV equivalent neutron fluence in silicon. Figure [\ref=fig:S21_warm_SYS] shows that the device-to-device fluctuations increase with irradiation and that the effect of protons is about 4 - 5 times larger on the voltage gain compared to that of neutrons at the same fluence values. Input impedances were found to stay close to 50  Ω and real throughout the entire irradiation range for protons and up to [formula] for neutrons. The output impedance shows similar behavior and stays roughly twice as long close to 50  Ω. Beyond these limits the impedances stay real but rise quickly resulting in non-matched conditions in ATLAS, where 0.5 - 2  m 50  Ω cables connect the detector and the pre-amplifiers and [formula] 50  Ω cables carry the signals from the ASIC output to the shaper electronics.

Cold Results

About three months after the neutron irradiation tests at NPI in Re z the irradiated boards have been shipped to the lab in Munich and re-tested with the same set of measurements as in situ in both warm and cold (liquid nitrogen) conditions. The three front-most boards received neutron fluences in excess of [formula] (Si 1  MeV eq. in Re z). From Figure [\ref=fig:S21_warm_SYS] it can be seen that beyond [formula] the ASICs approach 0 voltage gain and therefore the three first boards are dead. The board in the fourth slot was exposed to [formula] and this one plus the following four boards from slots 5,6,8, and 9, with respective fluences of 10.0, 6.9, 3.8, and [formula] are still operational in warm conditions and still show the same performance as was measured at the end of the run in situ at Re z. In addition to these 5 fluence points non-irradiated ASICs have been measured in warm and cold as well to provide data at zero fluence. Immersed in liquid nitrogen to emulate the conditions inside the ATLAS cryostat the performance is dramatically worse than in warm conditions. Figure [\ref=fig:S21_Rin_warm_cold_SYS] shows the normalized forward transmission coefficient and the input impedance for the systems comprised of one pre-amplifier and a summing amplifier as function of neutron fluence for both warm and cold conditions. The sparse data points on the left indicate the cold measurements, while the denser groups of points extending to larger fluences are the measurements in the warm. The performance in the cold is roughly equivalent to that in warm at 3 times larger fluences. The performance degrades quickly beyond [formula].

The pulse measurements as described in section [\ref=sec:pulse] have also been repeated with the already irradiated boards in warm and in cold. The pulse amplitudes have been adjusted to lower levels to still correspond to 10 - 1000  μA input currents for non-irradiated ASICs for the short (~  4  m) cables used at MPP. The increase of non-linearity of the response was found to be described by a power-law relation of input ([formula]) and output ([formula]) amplitude of the form:

[formula]

where c is a fluence dependent constant and x the power-law exponent. Values for x deviating from 1.0 indicate non-linear behavior.

Figure [\ref=fig:pa_non_lin] shows this exponent as function of neutron fluence in warm and cold. Like in the case of the forward transmission coefficient the non-linearities for irradiated ASICs are worse in the cold and correspond roughly to those in the warm at 3 times larger fluences. Since up to 16 pre-amplifiers are summed by one summing amplifier in ATLAS the non-linearities for the pre-amplifiers can not be corrected. An exponent of 1.03 or 0.97 would correspond to a maximum deviation of the output amplitude from linear expectation normalized to the maximum amplitude of 1%. This original requirement limit for the non-linearity of the pre-amplifiers is indicated by the horizontal lines in Figure [\ref=fig:pa_non_lin]. Beyond neutron fluences of [formula] the non-linearity quickly rises above this level.

The degraded S-parameter measurements in the full frequency range of 300  kHz - 100  MHz have been used to predict the response to a typical ionization signal in the HEC after the full electronics chain for the HEC in ATLAS [\cite=art:HEC-note-109]. Figure [\ref=fig:pulse] shows the simulated response to a 400  ns triangular current in a typical HEC channel at 4 different fluence values. It can be seen that on top of the gain degradation the pulse shape worsens with increasing fluence leading to a slower rise- and fall-time, a broader and more delayed positive peak.

Fluence Conversion for GaAs

The neutron fluence values given in all the figures presented so far are 1  MeV equivalent fluences evaluated for the neutron spectrum at NPI in Re z [\cite=art:Bem]. In order to compare these values to expectations for the HL-LHC the fluences have to be converted for the [formula] devices studied here first to the corresponding 1  MeV equivalent fluence in [formula] using the NPI neutron spectrum and the Kerma factor for neutrons in silicon and gallium-arsenide [\cite=art:Kerma]. In a second step using the expected neutron, proton and pion spectra in ATLAS [\cite=art:ATLASRad] the 1  MeV equivalent neutron fluence in [formula] has to be converted back to [formula] again using Kerma factors for the relevant radiation in both [formula] and [formula]. It was found that the conversion from Si to GaAs at NPI energies is 1.82 and from GaAs to Si at the location of the ASICs in ATLAS 1 / 1.35. All measured neutron fluences at NPI reported here can thus be converted to ATLAS expectations by multiplying with 1.82 / 1.35.

The proton-irradiated boards were not retrievable from PSI and thus cold measurements of the proton irradiated ASICs are not available. Assuming that

the results in the cold would be worse compared to the warm in-situ measurements by the same factor of 3 as observed in the neutron tests

the effect of 1  p  /  cm2 with kinetic energy of 200  MeV in [formula] according to the Kerma factor and specific energy loss [\cite=art:PDG12] can be split in 1.4  n  /  cm2 1  MeV equivalent neutron fluence in [formula] and 465  pGy total ionization dose (TID)

it is possible to convert the [formula] numbers back to [formula] again and estimate the impact of the expected [formula] TID of 6.2  kGy in ATLAS at the HL-LHC, which would be equivalent to [formula] of the expected degradation due to 1  MeV equivalent neutrons.

Conclusions

Irradiation tests of the current readout electronics of the Hadronic Endcap Calorimeter of ATLAS with neutrons and protons with fluence levels exceeding those relevant for the high luminosity upgrade of the LHC have been performed. The most stringent limits have been observed under neutron irradiation and the measurements at liquid nitrogen temperatures show a [formula] times faster performance degradation compared to room temperature measurements.

The performance limit in the cold was reached at [formula] 1  MeV equivalent in [formula] for neutrons in Re z, where the forward transmission coefficient reduces to [formula], the input (output) impedance increases by [formula] ([formula]) above the nominal 50  Ω, and the power-law exponent reaches [formula]. These levels correspond to [formula] 1  MeV equivalent in [formula] for ATLAS at the position of the ASICs.

With the current safety factor of 5 for the radiation level simulations for ATLAS this limit will be reached at the HL-LHC. The impact on the ATLAS physics performance of the degraded electronics and upgrade options of the readout electronics for the HL-LHC are currently under study.
