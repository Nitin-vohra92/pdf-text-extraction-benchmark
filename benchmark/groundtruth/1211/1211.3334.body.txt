Jets in heavy ion collisions with ATLAS

Introduction

Collisions of lead ions at Large Hadron Collider (LHC) are expected to create a strongly interacting matter in which quarks and gluons are locally deconfined. Jets produced in hard scattering are expected to be modified due to the energy loss of outgoing parton traversing the hot QCD medium. This effect is commonly referred to as a jet quenching. Jets therefore represent an important tool for studying both the properties of the deconfined matter and the parton energy loss [\cite=jqt]. In this paper we will provide a status report on jet measurements performed using the 2010 and 2011 Pb+Pb data at   =  2.76  collected by the ATLAS detector [\cite=Atlas:2008]. The first evidence of the jet quenching at LHC has been observed in the measurement of the di-jet asymmetry [\cite=Aad:2010bu]. In central heavy ion collisions an excess of events with large di-jet asymmetry has been observed when compared to p+p or Pb+Pb Monte Carlo (MC) reference. This asymmetry has been accompanied by a balance in azimuth, that is jets in the di-jet system remain "back-to-back" despite to a sizable modification of their energy. This measurement is an observation measurement and by itself it is insufficient to provide detailed information about the parton energy loss. To gain more information we need to ask more detailed questions: We need to know how does the modification of the inclusive jet spectra depend on the jet [formula], jet size, or direction of the jet with respect to the reaction plane. We also need to know whether the suppression depends on the flavor of the initial parton. Last but not least we should learn how is the internal structure of jets modified. These questions will be addressed in the sections [\ref=sec:inclusive]-[\ref=sec:frag]. Section [\ref=sec:event] summarizes the event selection and centrality definition, section [\ref=sec:perform] discusses the jet reconstruction performance.

Event selection and centrality definition

Analyses presented in this summary use 2010 or 2011 LHC heavy ion runs, colliding nuclei at   =  2.76 . The 2010 run collected approximately [formula] whereas 2011 run collected 0.14 nb- 1. Minimum bias Pb+Pb collisions were identified using measurements from the zero-degree calorimeters (ZDCs) and the minimum-bias trigger scintillator (MBTS) counters. In the offline analysis, events were required to have a primary vertex reconstructed from charged particle tracks with   >  500 . The 2010 data-taking used only the minimum bias trigger whereas the in the 2011 run, events were selected for recording using a combination of the minimum bias trigger and high-level trigger (HLT). The HLT triggered on jets, high-[formula]  photons, electrons, and muons.

The centrality of each heavy ion collision is determined using the sum of the transverse energy in all cells in the forward calorimeter (3.1  <  |η|  <  4.9), at the electromagnetic scale. The average number of nucleon-nucleon collisions, [formula] , and the average number of participating nucleons, Npart , were calculated using the standard MC Glauber model [\cite=glauber].

Jet reconstruction performance

Jets discussed in this summary has been reconstructed at the calorimeter level using the anti-[formula] algorithm [\cite=Cacciari:2008gp]. The elliptic flow modulated underlying event contribution to the reconstructed jets has been subtracted on the event-by-event basis. All the discussed measurements have been corrected to the particle level by unfolding procedures such that they can be directly compared to theoretical models.

To evaluate the combined performance of the ATLAS detector and the jet reconstruction procedures the MC PYTHIA [\cite=PYTHIA] di-jet events were embedded into HIJING [\cite=HIJING] minimum bias events. The reference PYTHIA "truth" jets were reconstructed using the PYTHIA final-state particles by the anti-[formula] algorithm with different radius parameters of R = 0.2,0.3,0.4, and 0.5. Separately, the presence and approximate kinematics of HIJING-generated jets were obtained by running R  =  0.4 anti-[formula] reconstruction on final-state HIJING particles having   >  4 . To prevent the overlap of PYTHIA and HIJING jets from distorting the jet performance evaluated relative to PYTHIA truth jets, all PYTHIA truth jets within [formula] of a   >  10   HIJING jet were excluded from the analysis. To eliminate jets originating from the underlying event fluctuations ("UE-jets") the calorimeter jets were required to match a jet reconstructed from inner detector tracks or an electromagnetic cluster.

PYTHIA truth jets passing the HIJING-jet exclusion were matched to the closest reconstructed jet of the same R value within ΔR  =  0.2. The resulting matched jets were used to evaluate the jet energy resolution (JER) and the jet energy scale (JES). The jet reconstruction efficiency is defined as the fraction of truth jets for which a matching reconstructed jet is found. The efficiency was evaluated both prior to (ε) and following (ε') UE-jet rejection described above. Figure [\ref=fig:perform] shows a summary of the jet reconstruction performance for anti-[formula] R = 0.2 and R = 0.4 jets.

The JER was characterized by σ[null]  /  , where σ[null] is the standard deviation of the Δ  =    -   distribution. The JES closure was evaluated from the mean fractional energy shift, 〈Δ  /  〉. The JER was found to be well described by a quadrature sum of three terms,

[formula]

where a and c represent the usual sampling and constant contributions to calorimeter resolution. The term containing b describes the contribution of the underlying event fluctuations to the JER. This contribution can be independently evaluated by measuring the transverse energy fluctuations in the minimum bias events. This has been done in the fluctuation analysis reported in Ref. [\cite=fluctuations]. A good consistency between the results of the fluctuation analysis and the parametrization of the JER has been achieved. Simultaneously, a good agreement between the fluctuations in the data and HIJING has been observed.

The jet reconstruction efficiency decreases with decreasing jet [formula]  for [formula] . The decrease starts at larger [formula] and decreases more rapidly for larger jet radii and in more central collisions. An independent check of the basic performance has been done by using PYTHIA jets embedded directly to the minimum bias data. The reconstruction efficiency was found to differ between central and peripheral collisions by less then 5% on the rise of the efficiency curve for R = 0.4 jets and the agreement in the JES was found to be better then a 1% between central and peripheral collisions. More details about the jet reconstruction procedures as well as the jet performance can be found in Ref. [\cite=jets].

Inclusive jet suppression

The first step beyond the original asymmetry measurement is to measure the suppression in the inclusive jet yields. To quantify the suppression we introduce the jet RCP , defined as a fraction of per-event normalized jet yield, N̂, measured in a given centrality bin to the per-event normalized jet yield measured in the 60-80% most peripheral collisions, that is

[formula]

where Rcentcoll is the central-to-peripheral ratio of number of binary collisions. The jet RCP has been measured for six centrality bins, [formula] {0-10%, 10-20%, 20-30%, 30-40%, 40-50%, 50-60%}. The resulting jet RCP evaluated as a function of jet [formula] for 0-10% central and 50-60% peripheral collisions is presented in the left panel of Figure [\ref=fig:jetrcp]. One can see that the jet RCP in the most central collision does not exhibit any strong dependence on the jet [formula] . A suppression by a factor of two of inclusive jet yields in 0-10% central with respect to 60-80% peripheral collisions can be observed.

The dependence of the jet suppression on the jet size is summarized in the right panel of Figure [\ref=fig:jetrcp] in terms of the ratio of RCP values between R  =  0.3,0.4, and 0.5 jets and R  =  0.2 jets, R  /  0.2, as a function of [formula] for the 0-10% centrality bin. This result indicates a significant dependence of RCP on the jet radius. For   <  100  the R  /  0.2 values for both R  =  0.4 and R  =  0.5 differ from one beyond the statistical and systematic uncertainties. This deviation persists well beyond 100  and is also present in 10-20% centrality bin. However, the direct comparisons of RCP between different jet radii at low [formula]  should be treated with care as the same jets measured using smaller radii will tend to appear in lower [formula] bins than when measured with a larger radius. Further details on the inclusive jet suppression can be found in Ref. [\cite=jets].

To get more insight into the dependence of the jet suppression on the path length the original parton would have traversed trough the medium the variation of inclusive jet yields as a function of azimuthal angle, Δφ , with respect to the elliptic flow event plane was measured. This variation can be quantified using the ratio of jet yield in one Δφ bin i to another j, [formula], defined by

[formula]

where the jet yield Y(,φ) is measured in four Δφ bins spanning equidistantly the range 0  <    <  π / 2. The resulting [formula] distributions plotted as a function of jet [formula] are shown in Figure [\ref=fig:rp]. A clear reduction of the jet yield with increasing Δφ is observed. For example, in the 20-30% centrality bin, jets produced in the direction perpendicular to the elliptic flow event plane (3π / 8  <    <  π / 2) are suppressed by ≈  15% with respect to jets produced in the direction of the elliptic flow plane (0  <    <  π / 8). Another way to quantify the azimuthal dependence of the jet suppression is to measure the elliptic flow parameter of jets, vjet2. The vjet2 was found to decrease with increasing centrality and to have a characteristic centrality dependence known from elliptic flow measurements of single particles [\cite=flow]. The vjet2 reaches its maximum of ≈  0.04 - 0.05 in mid-central collisions ([formula]) for jets with   =  45 - 60 . More details on the azimuthal dependence of inclusive jet suppression can be found in Ref. [\cite=azimuth].

Photon-jet and Z0-jet correlations

The fact that the measured jet suppression at LHC is not an effect of initial state modifications was proven by the measurement of inclusive yields of prompt photons [\cite=gamma] and inclusive yields of W±,Z0 vector bosons [\cite=wboson] [\cite=zboson] which do not exhibit any suppression in central heavy ion collisions. Since photons and vector bosons are insensitive to the colored medium they can provide means to calibrate the expected energy of quenched jet in a photon-jet system or in a Z0-jet system. The quenching of the jet in the photon-jet sample can be quantified by measuring the jet to photon energy ratio, xJγ  =  jet  /  γ. The left panel of Figure [\ref=fig:gaf] shows the integrated per-photon jet yield, RJγ, evaluated as a function of the number of participants for data and MC. A clear suppression of the jet yield is seen in central compared to peripheral collisions. The measurement is performed for two different jet sizes, R = 0.2 and R  =  0.3 providing the same result within the systematic uncertainties. Qualitatively the same result has been obtained also from the Z0-jet correlation measurements in which the Z0 have been identified from the e+e- and μ+μ- decays. The same trend in the evolution of the jet suppression as a function of centrality has been observed despite to the limited statistics of less then forty Z0-jet events. These results provide a starting point for precision measurements of the jet quenching which will be allowed by future high luminosity heavy ion runs at LHC. More details on γ-jet correlations are provided in Ref. [\cite=gammajet], details on Z0-jet correlations are provided in Ref. [\cite=zjet].

Heavy flavor suppression

To access the difference between the jet suppression of heavy quarks and light quarks the semi-leptonic decays of open heavy flavor hadrons into muons has been measured. The measurement was performed over the muon transverse momentum range 4  <    <  14 . Over this [formula] range, muon production results predominantly from a combination of charm and bottom quark semi-leptonic decays. The differential yield of muons in a given centrality and [formula] bin was compared to that in a peripheral bin through the central-to-peripheral ratio, RCP . The right panel of Figure [\ref=fig:gaf] shows a comparison of the muon RCP as a function of centrality for four different [formula] intervals. One can see a smooth decrease in the RCP with increasing centrality. The suppression does not change with the muon [formula] while the size of the suppression changes by nearly a factor of two between the most central and the most peripheral bins. A similar size of suppression between the yields of muons from semi-leptonic heavy quark decays and inclusive jet yields together with the RCP of muons being rather flat a as a function of [formula] suggests no dramatic difference between the light and heavy quark response to the medium. More details on the heavy flavor suppression are provided in Ref. [\cite=heavyflavor].

Jet fragmentation

One of the tools that allow precise comparison between the data and and theoretical models of jet quenching is the measurement of jet fragmentation.

The key question to address is how are the parton showers modified by the medium. To provide an experimental answer to this question we measure the [formula]  spectra of charged particles inside jets, D(), and the jet fragmentation function, D(z), defined as

[formula]

where Njet represents the total number of measured jets in the given centrality bin, Δ() and Δ(z) represent the number of measured charged particles within ΔR  =  0.4 of the jets in given bins of [formula] and z, respectively, and ε represents the MC-evaluated [formula] and pseudorapidity dependent reconstruction efficiency. The fragmentation variable, z, is defined as a ratio of charged particle momentum to the momentum of associated jet, z  =  trk  /  jet cos ΔR, where ΔR is the distance between the jet axis and a charged particle. The underlying event contribution to the D(z) and D() distributions is determined on the jet-by-jet basis and subtracted from the measured distributions. Jet fragmentation has been measured for three different jet radius parameters, R = 0.4,0.3, and 0.2 providing quantitatively the same result. The ratio of central to 60-80% peripheral collisions of D([formula]) distributions, RD(), and D(z) distributions, RD(z), is calculated. The RD() and RD(z) has been measured for six centrality bins, 0-10%, 10-20%, 20-30%, 30-40%, 40-50%, and 50-60%. The resulting distributions for R  =  0.4 jets and 0-10% centrality bin are plotted in Figure [\ref=fig:frag]. The ratios show a reduction of fragment yield in all centrality bins relative to the 60-80% bin at intermediate z values, [formula] and an enhancement in fragment yield for [formula]. No significant modification is seen in D(z) or D() distributions at high [formula]  or z. The reduction in the yield at intermediate z decreases gradually from central to peripheral collisions. More details on the jet fragmentation measurement is provided in Ref. [\cite=fragmentation].

The picture of the jet fragmentation at high-[formula] is consistent with both the inclusive jet suppression and suppression of single charged particles reported in Ref. [\cite=trkspectra]. The charged particle RCP  achieves a value of ≈  0.6, that is a similar value as the RCP of inclusive jets. Since the RCP of inclusive jets is rather flat as a function jet [formula] and since all the measured charged particles at high-[formula] should be also measured in jets we can expect no significant modification of yields of high-[formula] fragments between central and peripheral collisions. This is indeed seen in the measurement of the jet fragmentation.

Summary

We have presented results of the measurement of inclusive jet suppression, azimuthal dependence of jet suppression, jet suppression in γ-jet and Z0-jet system, suppression of heavy flavor, and jet fragmentation. We find that the inclusive jet yields are suppressed by approximately a factor of two in central compared to peripheral collisions. This suppression has only a weak dependence on the jet [formula] . A significant dependence of the jet suppression on the jet size is seen - with increasing jet radius the suppression is weaker. The jet suppression depends on the direction of the jet with respect to elliptic flow event plane. A maximal difference of ≈  15% in the jet yields for jets produced in plane compared to jets produced perpendicular to the elliptic flow plane is observed. The jet suppression is also observed in γ-jet and Z0-jet systems. The measurement of semi-leptonic decays of open heavy flavor hadrons to muons suggests a similar suppression of heavy quark jets and light quark jets. The jet fragmentation function and momentum spectra of charged particles produced inside jets are modified in central compared to peripheral collisions. The yield of low-z fragments is enhanced whereas the yield of intermediate z fragments is suppressed. No sizable difference of high-z fragments is seen.
