Introduction and definitions

On non-amenable graphs, not only Gibbs measures but also the free energy (and the entropy) depend on the boundary conditions.

The purpose of this paper is to study this dependence for one of the simplest such graph, the Cayley tree (Bethe lattice). Our analysis is restricted to the Ising model.

Let Γk  =  (V,L) be the uniform Cayley tree, where each vertex has k  +  1 neighbors with V being the set of vertices and L the set of edges.

On this tree, there is a natural distance to be denoted d(x,y), being the number of nearest neighbor pairs of the minimal path between the vertices x and y (by path one means a collection of nearest neighbor pairs, two consecutive pairs sharing at least a given vertex).

The Ising model is defined by the formal Hamiltonian

[formula]

where the sum runs over nearest neighbor vertices 〈x,y〉 and the spins σ(x) take values in the set Φ  =  { + 1, - 1}.

For a fixed x0∈V, the root, let be respectively the sphere and the ball of radius n with center at x0, and for x∈Wn let

[formula]

be the set of direct successors of x.

The (finite-dimensional) Gibbs distributions at inverse temperature β = 1 / T are defined by

[formula]

with partition functions given by

[formula]

Here

[formula]

is a collection of real numbers that stands for (generalized) boundary condition.

The probability distributions ([\ref=*]) are said compatible if for all σn - 1

[formula]

It is well known that this compatibility condition is satisfied if and only if for any x∈V the following equation holds

[formula]

where

[formula]

Namely, for any boundary condition satisfying the functional equation ([\ref=***]) there exists a unique Gibbs measure, the correspondence being one-to-one.

We will be interested in the dependence with respect to boundary conditions of the free energy defined as the limit

[formula]

where |  ·  | denotes hereafter the cardinality of a set.

A boundary condition satisfying ([\ref=***]) will be in the sequel called compatible.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the first part of results: a general formula applied then to various known boundary conditions (translation-invariant, Bleher-Ganikhodjaev, Zachary, ART), and those about entropy. Periodic and weakly periodic cases are the subject of Section 3. A first appendix concerns the density of colors mentioned in the abstract. A second appendix provides a sufficient condition for the existence of the free energy in case of compatible boundary conditions.

General formula and first results

For compatible boundary conditions, the free energy is given by the formula

[formula]

where

[formula]

To see it, first notice that

[formula]

where [formula] with b(x) satisfying

[formula]

This formula used with both values of ε implies

[formula]

It is then enough to insert this formula into the recursive equation ([\ref=re]) to get by iteration

[formula]

which gives ([\ref=fe2]).

Notice that

[formula]

where - h = { - hx,x∈V}.

Translation-invariant boundary conditions

They correspond to constant functions, hx = h, in which case the condition ([\ref=***]) reads

[formula]

The equation ([\ref=f]) has a unique solution h = 0, if [formula] and three distinct solutions h = 0,  ±  h* (h* > 0), when θ  >  θc.

Let us denote by μ0, μ± the corresponding Gibbs measures and recall the following known results for the ferromagnetic Ising model (θ  ≥  0):

If θ  ≤  θc, μ0 is unique and extreme.

If θ  >  θc, μ- and μ+, are extreme.

μ0 is extreme if and only if [formula].

(see e.g. [\cite=Pr], [\cite=Ge], [\cite=BRZ])

According to formula ([\ref=fe2]), the free energies of translation-invariant (TI) b.c. are given by:

[formula]

Some particular plots are shown in Fig. [\ref=fig1].

In order to draw the free energy FTI(β,h) as a function of β, we notice that the equation ([\ref=f]) gives

[formula]

and use the parametric representation defined by the following mapping: The function F(h) is defined by inserting ([\ref=betah]) into ([\ref=zero]) and ([\ref=tife]).

Bleher-Ganikhodjaev construction

Here one consider the half tree. Namely the root x0 has k nearest neighbours. Consider an infinite path [formula] (the notation x < y meaning that pathes from the root to y go through x). Associate to this path a collection hπ of numbers given by the condition

[formula]

[formula] where [formula] (resp. [formula]) means that x is on the left (resp. right) from the path π.

For any infinite path π, the collection of numbers hπ satisfying relations ([\ref=***]) exists and is unique (see [\cite=BG]).

A real number t = t(π), 0  ≤  t  ≤  1 can be assigned to the infinite path and the set hπ(t) is uniquely defined. The set of numbers hπ(t) being distinct for different t∈[0,1], it is also the case for the corresponding Gibbs measures. One thus obtains uncountable many Gibbs measures and they are extreme.

Since the solution hπ can differ from h* or - h* only on the path π, it is thus obvious that the values hπx, x∈π do not contribute to the free energy. As a consequence, we get from the evenness ([\ref=tife]), that the free energies of Bleher-Ganikhodjaev and translation-invariant boundary conditions coincide:

[formula]

Zachary construction.

This construction provides an (uncountable) set of distinct functions h(t) satisfying condition ([\ref=***]) and parameterized by t∈( - h*,h*). It is assumed here that θ  >  θc.

Take t  ≠  0 and define the sequence (tn)n  ≥  0 recursively by t0 = t,

[formula]

Since the function f is increasing and maps the interval ( - h*,h*) into itself, the definition of tn make sense. Moreover one can see that lim n  →    ∞tn = 0 for each t0 = t.

Consider the function h(t)x = tn for all x∈Wn. This function satisfies condition ([\ref=***]) for any t and by construction, distinct t assign distinct h(t). The associated Gibbs measures are known to be extreme [\cite=Z].

The corresponding free energies can be written as

[formula]

where (t)  =   ln [null].

By Stolz-Cesáro theorem (see e.g. [\cite=K]) applied to the sequences

[formula]

one has

[formula]

As a consequence

[formula]

ART construction

Let h be a boundary condition satisfying ([\ref=***]) on Γk0. For k  ≥  k0 + 1 define the following boundary condition on Γk:

[formula]

where Vk denote the set of vertices of Γk. Namely, to each vertices of Vk0 one adds k - k0 successors with vanishing value of the boundary condition. It is obvious the b.c. h̃ satisfy the compatibility condition ([\ref=***]). In this way one constructs a new set of Gibbs measures that are extreme in the range [formula] [\cite=Ak].

For the corresponding free energy, we have

[formula]

Since

[formula]

by taking into account 0  ≤  a(x)  ≤  Cb, we get

[formula]

As a consequence,

[formula]

so that

[formula]

Entropy

To compute the entropy [formula], we first notice that equation ([\ref=betah]) gives

[formula]

As a result of easy computations, we get the formula

[formula]

and

[formula]

Let us mention that in case k = 2, we get by solving equation ([\ref=f]) the following value of h* as a function of the inverse temperature:

[formula]

The free energies and entropies then read

[formula]

Periodic and weakly periodic Gibbs measures

A group representation of the Cayley tree

Let Gk be a free product of k  +  1 cyclic groups of the second order with generators [formula], respectively.

It is known that there exists a one-to-one correspondence between the set of vertices V of the Cayley tree Γk and the group Gk.

To give this correspondence we fix an arbitrary element x0∈V and let it correspond to the unit element e of the group Gk. Using [formula] we numerate nearest-neighbors of element e, moving by positive direction (see Fig. [\ref=figure2]). Now we shall give numeration of the nearest-neighbors of each ai, [formula] by aiaj, [formula]. Since all ai have the common neighbor e we give to it aiai = a2i = e. Other neighbors are numerated starting from aiai by the positive direction. We numerate the set of all nearest-neighbors of each aiaj by words aiajaq, [formula], starting from aiajaj = ai by the positive direction. Iterating this argument one gets a one-to-one correspondence between the set of vertices V of the Cayley tree Γk and the group Gk.

In the group Gk, let us consider the left (right) shift transformations defined as follows. For g0∈Gk, let us set

[formula]

The set of all left (right) shifts in Gk is isomorphic to the group Gk.

Periodic boundary conditions

In this subsection, we consider periodic solutions of ([\ref=***]) and use the above group structure of the Cayley tree.

Let [formula] be a normal subgroup of the group Gk. The set h  =  {hx:x∈Gk} is said to be [formula]-periodic if hyx = hx for any x∈Gk and [formula].

Let

[formula]

Note that G(2)k is the set of even vertices (i.e. with even distance to the root). Consider the boundary conditions h± and h∓:

[formula]

and denote by μ(  ∓  ),μ(  ±  )) the corresponding Gibbs measures.

The [formula]- periodic solutions of equation ([\ref=***]) are either translation-invariant (Gk-periodic) or G(2)k-periodic (see [\cite=GR]), they are solutions to

[formula]

In the ferromagnetic case only translation invariant b.c. can be found. In the antiferromagnetic case (θ  ≤  0) the system ([\ref=ff]) has a unique solution h = 0 if θ  ≥   - 1 / k, and three distinct solutions h = 0, h± and h∓ if θ  <   - 1 / k.

Let us also recall that for the antiferromagnetic Ising model:

If θ  ≥   - 1 / k, μ0 is unique and extreme.

If θ <  - 1 / k, μ(  ±  ) and μ(  ∓  ), are extreme.

see [\cite=Ge].

For periodic measures, we have

[formula]

Weakly periodic Gibbs measures.

Let Gk  /  Ĝk  =  {H1,...,Hr} be a factor group, where Ĝk is a normal subgroup of index r  ≥  1.

A set h = {hx,x∈Gk} is called Ĝk - weakly periodic, if hx = hij, for any [formula], where [formula] denotes the ancestor of x.

Weakly periodic b.c. h coincide with periodic ones if hx is independent of [formula].

Here, we will restrict ourself to the cases of index two and recall that any such subgroup has the form

[formula]

where [formula], and ωx(ai) is the number of ai in a word x∈Gk. We consider A  ≠  Nk: when A  =  Nk weak periodicity coincides with standard periodicity.

Let Gk / HA  =  {H0,H1} be the factor group, where [formula]. Then, in view of ([\ref=***]), the HA-weakly periodic b.c. has the form

[formula]

where the hi satisfy the following equations:

[formula]

For sake of simplicity, consider k = 4 and |A| = 1. In this case

[formula]

[formula]

These sets are shown in Fig. [\ref=WP].

Let us recall the following results of [\cite=RR]:

There exists a critical value αcr (  ≈  0,1569) of α = e- 2βJ such that:

If α  >  αcr, there exists a unique weakly periodic state μ0,

If α  =  αcr, there are three distinct weakly periodic states μ0,μ-1,μ+1.

If 0  ≤  α  <  αcr, there are five distinct weakly periodic states μ0,μ-1,μ+1,μ-2,μ+2.

These measures correspond to solutions of system ([\ref=wp6]) on the invariant set h1 =  - h4, h2 =  - h3, that is to solutions of:

[formula]

More results about weakly periodic Gibbs measures can be found in [\cite=RR], [\cite=RR1].

Denote

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

where Ln is the set of edges in Vn.

For weakly periodic b.c. ([\ref=wpj7]) we have

[formula]

[formula]

By Proposition [\ref=l4] of the appendix we obtain

[formula]

In the case under consideration the proposition is straightforward. Indeed one immediately see, in view of definitions and Fig. [\ref=WP], that (An  +  Dn) / (|Vn| - 1) = 4 / 5 and (Bn  +  Cn) / (|Vn| - 1) = 1 / 5 when n = 1; the induction is trivial.

The equation

[formula]

that solves the system ([\ref=wpj7]) (with h2 = 4f(h1,θ)) can then be reduced to:

[formula]

which has two solutions ξ1 and ξ2 when 0 < α  <  αcr (see [\cite=RR]).

The free energy then reads:

[formula]

The solution ξ1 is given by

[formula]

where

[formula]

The corresponding free energy reads

[formula]

where

[formula]

The plot is given in Fig. [\ref=WPPlot] from which we observe the strict inequalities

[formula]

in the range α  ≤  αcr.

The results for weakly periodic boundary conditions have to be compared with the inequalities given recently in [\cite=GRS]; the weakly periodic b.c.  ([\ref=wpj7]) corresponding to the so-called dimer covering in [\cite=GRS]. There, the inequalities are easier to catch with cluster expansion method in mind, the condition on the temperature is more restrictive, and the free energies cannot be expressed explicitly.

Appendix: Density of edges in a ball

In this appendix we consider a group representation of a Cayley tree and its partition with respect to an arbitrary subgroup of index two. This partition gives a 2-vertex-coloring on Cayley tree, which then gives 4-edge-coloring, say, colors i = 1,2,3,4. We fix a root of the Cayley tree and give explicit formulas for number An,i of edges with color i in a ball Vn of radius n with the center at the root. Moreover, we compute the lim n  →    ∞(An,i / |Vn|) for each i = 1,2,3,4.

We will use the notation of Subsection [\ref=SWP] and let

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

for A = {1,2,3,...,j} and 1  ≤  j  ≤  k + 1.

Let M be the set of all unit balls with vertices in V and let S1(x) denotes the set of all nearest neighbors of x. For b∈M the center of b is denoted by cb.

If cb∈H0, then

[formula]

If cb∈H1, then

[formula]

We have [formula]

If cb∈H0, (the case cb∈H1 is similar) then cbap∈H1 for p = 1,2,...,j and cbap∈H0 for p = j + 1,j + 2,...,k + 1, i.e. we have

[formula]

Consider b = V1∈M with the center x0 = e∈H0, then in W1 we have j vertices which belong to H1, and k - j + 1 vertices which belong in H0, consequently,

[formula]

For any n∈N the following recurrence system hold

[formula]

with initial values α1 = k - j + 1, β1 = 0, γ1 = j, δ1 = 0.

By Lemma [\ref=l1], an edge [formula] with [formula] has (k - j) neighbor edges [formula] with [formula]. An edge [formula] with [formula] has (k - j + 1) neighbor edges [formula] with [formula]. Moreover, it is easy to see that only αn and βn have contribution to αn + 1. Hence we have αn + 1 = (k - j)αn + (k - j + 1)βn. Other equations of the system ([\ref=m1]) can be obtained by a similar way.

For αn we have

[formula]

with initial values

[formula]

The initial values follow from Lemma [\ref=l2].

By definitions of αn, βn, γn, δn we have

[formula]

From ([\ref=m1]) we get

[formula]

Substituting these values in ([\ref=m4]) and then simplifying we get ([\ref=m2]).

To find solution of ([\ref=m2]) we denote

[formula]

From ([\ref=m2]) we get

[formula]

dividing by kn we obtain

[formula]

with initial values

[formula]

In order to find solution to ([\ref=m6]) first we rid [formula] by denoting

[formula]

Substituting ([\ref=m8]) to ([\ref=m6]) we get

[formula]

with

[formula]

The characteristic equation for ([\ref=m9]) has the following form (setting pn  =  λn):

[formula]

which has solutions

[formula]

Then the general solution to ([\ref=m9]) is

[formula]

where the coefficients A1, A2, A3 are determined by the initial conditions ([\ref=m10]).

Using ([\ref=m8]) and ([\ref=m5]) we get

[formula]

Then using ([\ref=m0]) and ([\ref=m11a]) one can find βn, γn and δn.

We have

[formula]

[formula]

It is easy to check that |λ2| < 1 and |λ3| < 1, i.e.

[formula]

Using these inequalities, formula ([\ref=m11a]) and ([\ref=vk]) we get

[formula]

Now using this formula together with ([\ref=m0]) we obtain

[formula]

The formulae involving γn and δn are obtained in a similar way.

By ([\ref=um]) and

[formula]

we get

[formula]

From ([\ref=m0]) we get

[formula]

that allows to prove the remaining formulae.

Appendix: Existence of the free energy

As we have seen in the previous sections free energy exists for each known compatible boundary condition. We note that a(x) is bounded: β- 1 ln 2  ≤  a(x)  ≤  Cβ. Hence limit ([\ref=fe2]) is also bounded. But the problem of convergence of ([\ref=fe2]) is still open. Here we shall give some conditions on h, under which the corresponding free energy exists.

Let [formula] be an infinite path. A function hx on the path π is called monotone non increasing (non decreasing) if hxi  ≥  hxi + 1, (hxi  ≤  hxi + 1), [formula].

Using Stolz-Cesáro theorem we get

[formula]

We shall show that An is monotone for n > n0. We have

[formula]

[formula]

By monotonicity of |hx| and by evenness of a(x) we notice that a(x) - a(y) does not change sign for all x,y with x < y. Thus An is monotone and since it is a bounded sequence it has a limit.
