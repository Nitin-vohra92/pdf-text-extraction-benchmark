A note on the number of induced nonseparating cycles in 3-connected graphs

Introduction

In this note, every graph is finite and simple. If S,H are vertex-disjoint subgraphs of G, then S + H is defined by the subgraph obtained from [formula] by adding all the edges in G between S and H. On the other hand, S - H: = S - V(H) denotes the subgraph of G obtained from S by deleting all vertices of H and edges incident to them. A graph G is 3-connected if G - H is connected for all subgraph H such that |V(H)|  ≤  2. If v∈V(H) and H is a subgraph of G, then NH(v) denotes the set of all neighbors of v in H and deg H(v): = |NH(v)|.

We do not allow multiple edges or loops in edge contractions. A graph H is a minor of G if it can be obtained by zero or more edge contractions from a subgraph of G. The Hadwiger number of G, denoted h(G), is the maximum number n such that the complete graph Kn with n vertices is a minor of G. An induced cycle C in G is nonseparating if G - C is connected. We denote by C(G) the set of all induced nonseparating cycles in G. To the author's knowledge, a few things are known about the number |C(G)| of induced nonseparating cycles. It is a classic result of Tutte(1963) that the induced non separating cycles generate the cycle space of 3-connected graphs. Since the cycle space of G has rank |E(G)| - |V(G)| + 1, this fact gives the following best-known lower bound of |C(G)|;

Our main result is the following strengthening of the above inequality;

(1.1)  For every 3-connected graph G, we have

Note that the left-hand-side function is increasing in h(G) and has minimum value 1. This in general gives a much stronger lower bound on |C(G)|, especially when the Hadwiger number is large. If a graph has many edges, then it has large Hadwiger number as proved by Böhme, Kostochka, and Thomason[\cite=Bohme]. Thus (1.1) gives a new lower bound on the number of induced nonseparating cycles in 3-connected graphs with many edges. More precisely, define a proper vertex colouring f of G over-dominating if

They showed following results;

(1.2)   If χ(G) = c and G has an over-dominating k-colouring then k = c if c  ≤  2 and c  ≤  k  ≤  2c - c - 1 otherwise. Moreover this inequality is best possible.

(1.3)   Let G be a graph that has an over-dominating k-colouring. Then h(G)  ≥  1 + ⌊2k / 3⌋ .

Thus we obtain the following corollary of (1.1);

(1.4)   If G is a 3-connected simple graph with an over-dominating k-colouring, then we have

A version of the Euler Characteristic

The right-hand-side graph parameter in (1.1) is motivated by the Euler Characteristic for graphs. We call it the graph characteristic and write Λ(G): = |C(G)| - |E(G)| + |V(G)|. Then the main theorem asserts that for any 3-connected graph G, we have We will show this assertion by showing that the graph characteristic of G decreases under contraction of some edge e, for which G / e is 3-connected and h(G / e) = h(G). The existence of such edge is a version of Tutte's contraction lemma, and is implied directly from Seymour's Splitter Theorem[\cite=Seymour]. The simple graph version of the theorem states that if H is a 3-connected minor of a 3-connected graph G, then there is a sequence of edge deletion and contraction from G to H, such that every intermediate graph is 3-connected.

(2.1)   Any 3-connected noncomplete graph G has an edge e such that G / e is 3-connected and h(G / e) = h(G).

Put H the maximal clique minor and apply the Splitter Theorem. One may use the fact that edge deletion and contraction commute.

Next, we are going to observe that when a graph G has a separating triangle, then Λ(G) is almost "additive" on its smaller "components". More precisely, suppose that a connected graph G has a separating triangle T. Let [formula] be the components of G - T, and define Gi = Hi + T for each 1  ≤  i  ≤  r. Then G is the clique-sum of the subgraphs [formula], and we may denote [formula]. This expression is unique up to the order of the factors, and we call it the decomposition of G at T. It is straightforward to check that each factors Gi are 3-connected if G is so. Then we have the following observation;

(2.2) Let G be a 3-connected graph such that [formula] for some triangle T. Then we have In particular, we have

We show if [formula] then C∈C(G). Write [formula]. Then it suffices to show that those two factors are connected and their intersection is nonempty. G1 - C is connected since C∈C(G1). On the other hand, note that C uses at most two vertices of T since it is an induced cycle different from T, so that deleting C from G2 yields deleting at most two vertices of T. But G2 is 3-connected since G is; hence G2 - C must be connected. Finally, G1 - C and G2 - C shares T - C, which is nonempty. Thus G - C is connected. This shows [formula]. By symmetry, we get the first assertion.

The second assertion is obtained by following calculation

[formula]

The last observation we need is that the number of induced nonseparating cycles in a 3-connected graph decreases under edge contractions.

(2.3)   Let G = (V,E) be a 3-connected graph and e = uv be an edge. Then there is an injection ψ:C(G / e)  →  C(G) such that ψ(C) / e = C for all C∈C(G / e).

Denote temporarily the set of all induced cycles in G by C(G). We first construct an injection ψ:C(G / e)  →  C(G). Define ψ(C) = C if C does not use the contracted vertex ve. Suppose C uses ve. Let x,y be the two endpoints of the induced path C - ve in G / e. Then both x and y are adjacent to at least one of u and v in G. If either u or v is adjacent to both x and y, then define ψ(C) = C - ve + u or ψ(C) = C - ve + v correspondingly. If both, we may choose any one of them. Otherwise we define ψ(C) = C - ve + u + v. The property ψ(C) / e = C follows from the definition, and it implies the injectivity of ψ.

Now fix C∈C(G / e). We will show that ψ(C)∈C(G). First suppose C does not use the vertex ve. Then ψ(C) = C and C uses none of u and v. Hence contraction of the edge e and deletion of C commute, i.e., (G / e) - C = (G - C) / e, so that if G - C is not connected then (G - C) / e, and consequently (G / e) - C is not connected as well, contrary to our assumption that C∈C(G / e). Thus ψ(C)∈C(G) in this case.

On the other hand, suppose C uses the vertex ve, and let x,y be the two neighbors of ve in C. We may assume without loss of generality that ux,vy∈E(G). One can observe that so that the right hand side must be connected. Now suppose for contradiction that G - ψ(C) is not connected. Since deleting the larger subgraph ψ(C) + u + v does not separate G, it must be the case that u + v - ψ(C) must be a component of G - ψ(C). This is impossible if ux,vy∈E, since then ψ(C) uses both u and v so that [formula]. So we may assume uy∈E(G) without loss of generality. The remaining cases contradict to the 3-connectivity of G. If vx∉E(G) then we have ψ(C) = (C - ve) + u so that u + v - ψ(C) = v must be a component of G - ψ(C). This means v has no neighbor outside ψ(C), and therefore NG(v) = {u,y}, contrary to the 3-connectedness of G. On the other hand, assume vx∈E(G). Here the ambiguity of ψ(C) comes; it can either be (C - ve) + u or (C - ve) + v. If u has a neighbor not in ψ(C), then define ψ(C) = (C - ve) + v so that u + v - ψ(C) = u is not a component of G - ψ(C) and get a contradiction. Similar argument applies to v. Hence we may assume that both u and v has no neighbor outside ψ(C). But then NG(u + v) = {x,y}, which contradicts to the 3-connectivity of G. This shows G - ψ(C) is connected.

The main proof

Proof of (1.1) We may suppose G is not complete. We use induction on the number of vertices |V(G)|. We claim that we may assume every triangle in G is nonseparating. Suppose for contrary that G has a separating triangle T, and let [formula] be the decomposition of G at T. Since G is 3-connected, each factor Gi is 3-connected. Moreover, h(Gi)  ≥  4 since contracting Gi - T to a single vertex yields K4. Thus by the induction hypothesis we obtain for each 1  ≤  i  ≤  r that On the other hand, it is well-known that if the clique-sum [formula] has Hadwiger number n, then either H1 or H2 has Hadwiger number n as well. Thus we may assume h(G1) = h(G). Now applying (2.2) to [formula], we obtain

[formula]

and inductively we get Λ(G)  ≥  Λ(G1). But then the induction hypothesis yields so that we have Λ(G)  ≥  Λ(Kh(G)) as desired. Hence we may assume that every triangle in G is nonseparating.

Now we apply (2.1). Let e be an edge of G for which G / e is 3-connected and h(G / e) = h(G). Hence the induction hypothesis applies to G / e, and we have Λ(G / e)  ≥  Λ(Kh(G)). Then it suffices to show Λ(G)  ≥  Λ(G / e). Denote by Te(G) the set of all triangles in G using e. It is easy to observe that For the induced nonseparating cycles, first note that Te(G)  ⊂  C(G) by the assumption. Also notice that no triangle of Te(G) lies in the image of ψ:C(G / e)  →  C(G), since T / e = K2∉C(G / e) for any T∈Te(G). This yields Now we have and this completes the induction.

Concluding remarks

The analogous result for the chromatic number, i.e., for 3-connected graphs, implies the Four Colour Theorem. Indeed, it is well-known that for 3-connected planar graphs different from K3, |C(G)| equals the number of faces in the planar drawing. Hence we have Λ(G) = 2, but Λ(Kχ(G))  ≤  2 implies χ(G)  ≤  4. Finally, the above assertion is true assuming the Hawiger conjecture, since Λ(Kn) is an increasing function in n so that χ(G)  ≤  h(G) yields Λ(Kχ(G))  ≤  Λ(Kh(G))  ≤  Λ(G).
