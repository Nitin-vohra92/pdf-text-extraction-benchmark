Semi-continuity of Complex Singularity Exponents in Singular Central Fiber Cases

Introduction

Complex singularity exponent is a quantitative measure of singularities of a holomorphic function. Arnold and Varchenko once studied some special cases of it from different perspectives. In [\cite=tia89], Tian first defined it clearly and applied it to his study of the Calabi problem. Related problems were also considered by Schwartz, Hörmander, Lojasiewicz, Gel'fand, Atiyah and Bernstein (see [\cite=kol08]). We now recall the definition.

Let X be a complex manifold and g be a Hermitian metric on X. Let K be a compact subset of X and f be a holomorphic function defined on X.

The complex singularity exponent of f on K is defined to be the nonnegative number If f(p)  ≠  0 for any p∈K, then we put cK(f) =  +   ∞  . If [formula] on X, then we put cK(f) = 0.

If K only contains a single point p, we will use the notation cp(f) instead of c{p}(f). It is easy to see that cK(f) =  min p∈Kcp(f).

Lower semi-continuity is a fundamental property of complex singularity exponent. It was Varchenko who first proved the semi-continuity of complex singularity exponents for some particular holomorphic families in [\cite=var83]. In [\cite=tia89], Tian has shown that the finiteness of [formula] is stable under holomorphic perturbation of f(x,y) with small sup norms, which implies semi-continuity for continuous families in 2 dimensions. For arbitrary dimensions, Phong and Sturm proved the holomorphic stability of [formula] for 1-parameter deformations in [\cite=ps00], which implies semi-continuity for 1-parameter holomorphic families. In [\cite=dk01], Demailly and Kollár proved semi-continuity of complex singularity exponents for plurisubharmonic functions, which contains holomorphic functions as special cases. Besides, their work generalized Tian's result about the stability of [formula] to arbitrary dimensions by applying Ohsawa-Takegoshi L2 extension theorem.

Let X be a complex manifold, and K is a compact subset of X. The map O(X)∋f  ↦  cK(f) is lower semi-continuous with respect to the topology of uniform convergence on compact sets (uniform convergence on a fixed neighborhood of K is of course enough). More explicitly, for every nonzero holomorphic function f, for every compact neighborhood L of K and every ε > 0, there is a number δ  =  δ(f,ε,K,L) > 0 such that

Moreover, if c < cK(f) and g converges to f in O(X), then |g|- 2c converges to |f|- 2c in L1 on some neighborhood U of K.

The purpose of this paper is to study the semi-continuity property of complex singularity exponents in singular central fiber cases. As far as I know, there is no known result in these cases. To begin with, let X be a complex manifold with [formula], π:X  →  Δ be a surjective flat holomorphic map with connected fibers, where Δ is the open disk centered at 0 in [formula] or [formula] itself. Define Xt: = π- 1(t). We also suppose that for any [formula], t is a regular value of π, hence Xt is smooth when t  ≠  0. Let p0 be a singular point of X0. Let pt∈Xt be a sequence of points, such that lim t  →  0pt = p0.

In this paper, we prove the following theorem:

Suppose [formula] is a holomorphic function, X(i)0 is any irreducible component of X0 containing p0. Denote ft = F|Xt, f(i)0 = F|X(i)0, then the inequality always holds.

The proof of main theorem relies on the Hironaka resolution theorem. If X0 is simple normal crossing, Theorem [\ref=Hironaka] ensures us to choose a log resolution of (X,V(F)) to get a family of log resolutions of (Xt,Vt), then cpt(ft) can be easily computed by these log resolutions and the adjunction formula. For general X0, we first use the Hironaka resolution theorem to pull back the integral on the resolution of X0, then we use the same idea as in the simple-normal-crossing case.

Moreover, we obtain a stronger form of the main theorem by applying the ACC for the log canonical threshold (cf. [\cite=dflm09], [\cite=dflm11] and [\cite=hmx12]):

Suppose [formula] is a holomorphic function, X(i)0 is any irreducible component of X0 containing p0. Denote ft = F|Xt, f(i)0 = F|X(i)0, then there exists δ > 0 such that

We also show the stability of integrals along fibers for some 2-dimensional cases.

Suppose X = D0(R0,R0), Δ = B0(R20) where R0 > 0. Suppose π is defined by π(x,y) = xy. Suppose F is irreducible in [formula]. Then for any 0 < c < c0(f0) and ft = F|Xt, there exists R > 0 and U = D0(R,R) such that

The key idea of proof is first to examine the asymptotic behavior of the integral near x-axis and y-axis, then apply Theorem [\ref=semicont_smooth] and Lemma [\ref=newton_polygon].

When turning to non-holomorphic families, the semi-continuity property may fail to hold as the following example shows:

In Section [\ref=sect_2], we will introduce the concept of log canonical threshold and discuss its basic properties and equivalence with complex singularity exponents. The proofs of the main theorem and its stronger form will be given in Section [\ref=sect_3]. In Section [\ref=sect_4], we will present the proof of Theorem [\ref=eff_irreducible]. Uniform upper bounds for integrals along fibers for any [formula] will be given as a direct corollary of Theorem [\ref=eff_irreducible]. In Section [\ref=sect_5], we construct a sequence of non-holomorphic examples (see Example [\ref=counterex_n]) which do not satisfy the lower semi-continuity property besides Example [\ref=counterex_1]. The key idea of construction is to find suitable homogeneous polynomials of [formula] and [formula]. The families in Example [\ref=counterex_n] are [formula] for arbitrary large n but not C∞.

Preliminaries on log canonical threshold

In this section, we will mainly discuss the log canonical threshold -- an algebraic counterpart of the complex singularity exponent. The following discussion will provide us methods from algebraic geometry to compute complex singularity exponent.

The log canonical threshold is a fundamental invariant in birational geometry. It was Shokurov who introduced it in the context of birational geometry in [\cite=sho92]. Next, we give the definition of log canonical threshold for Cartier divisors.

Let X be a normal algebraic variety with at worst log canonical singularities and let D be an effective [formula]-Cartier divisor on X. The log canonical threshold of (X,D) at point p∈X is defined by If D = (f = 0) then we always use the notation lctp(f) for lctp(X,D).

For smooth varieties, we have an elegant equivalence between complex singularity exponent and log canonical threshold. (See Section 2 in [\cite=kol08] for a detailed discussion.)

Let X be a smooth variety over [formula], p∈X a point and f a nonzero regular function on X. Then

which means lctp(f) = cp(f).

In order to compute log canonical threshold in general, we introduce the definition of relative canonical class first.

Let R be a commutative ring with identity. Suppose that g:Y  →  X is a proper birational morphism of schemes over R, with Y nonsingular. If rKX is Cartier, then there is a unique [formula]-divisor KY / X supported on the exceptional locus of g such that rKY and g*(rKX) + rKY / X are linearly equivalent. If X is nonsingular, then KY / X is effective and its support is the exceptional locus Ex(g). We call KY / X the relative canonical divisor w.r.t. g.

Let X and Y be complex manifolds, g:Y  →  X is a proper bimeromorphic morphism, then Jac  g is a set of holomorphic functions defined on any sufficiently small holomorphic coordinate chart of Y, which differs by a multiple of a non-vanishing holomorphic function in the intersection of any two overlapping holomorphic coordinate charts. We define a divisor KY / X on Y, satisfying for every sufficiently small holomorphic coordinate chart U, we have [formula]. Of course KY / X is well-defined, we call it the relative canonical divisor w.r.t. g.

Next two propositions provide us to compute log canonical threshold by resolution of singularities.

Let X be a normal algebraic variety with at worst log canonical singularities and let f be a nonzero regular function on X. Let p∈X be a point. Let g:Y  →  X be a proper birational morphism where Y is smooth and X is [formula]-Gorenstein. We may write

where Ei are different prime divisors on Y. Then we have The equality holds if [formula] is a simple-normal-crossing divisor, i.e. g:Y  →  X is a log resolution of (X,V(f)). In particular, [formula].

Let X be a complex manifold, f is a nonzero regular function on X. Let p∈X be a point. Let g:Y  →  X be a proper bimeromorphic morphism where Y is a complex manifold. We may write

where Ei are different prime divisors on Y. Then we have The equality holds if [formula] is a simple-normal-crossing divisor, i.e. g:Y  →  X is a log resolution of (X,V(f)). In particular, [formula].

We finish this section by giving some basic properties of log canonical threshold and complex singularity exponent.

For any p∈V(f), we have 0  ≤  cp(f) = lctp(f)  ≤  1.

At the end of this section, we give the following definition of complex singularity exponents for any possibly singular analytic subvarieties:

Let X be a complex manifold and g be a Hermitian metric on X. Suppose W is a possibly singular analytic subvariety of X, p∈W is a given point. Let f be a holomorphic function defined on W. Define dVW to be the volume form of the smooth locus of W induced by the Hermitian metric g.

The complex singularity exponent of f at p is defined to be the nonnegative number

By the definition above, if W has irreducible components [formula], then for any holomorphic function f on W, for any p∈V(f), we have

Proofs of the main theorem and its stronger form

In this section, we will present the proofs of the main theorem [\ref=main_thm] and its stronger form [\ref=stronger_main_thm]. We divide the proofs into three subsections. In Subsection [\ref=sect_3.1], we prove a special case of the main theorem, where X0 is assumed to be simple-normal-crossing. In Subsection [\ref=sect_3.2], we give the complete proof of the main theorem. In Subsection [\ref=sect_3.3], we present the proof of the stronger form of the main theorem.

Before we begin, let us fix some notations throughout this section. Let X be a complex manifold with [formula], π:X  →  Δ be a surjective flat holomorphic map with connected fibers, where Δ is the open disk centered at 0 in [formula] or [formula] itself. Define Xt: = π- 1(t). Suppose X(i)0 are the irreducible components of X0. We also suppose that for any [formula], t is a regular value of π, hence Xt is smooth when t  ≠  0. Let p0 be a singular point of X0. Let pt∈Xt be a sequence of points, such that lim t  →  0pt = p0.

When X0 is simple normal crossing

In this subsection, we will always assume X0 has only simple-normal-crossing singularities, and we will prove the main theorem in this special case. We will generalize this special case in the next subsection.

Suppose [formula] is a holomorphic function, X(i)0 is any irreducible component of X0 containing p0. Suppose X0 has only simple-normal-crossing singularities. Denote ft = F|Xt, f(i)0 = F|X(i)0, then the inequality always holds.

The key to the proof of Theorem [\ref=main_thm_1] is the following fibration version of the Hironaka resolution theorem:

Let f:X  →  C be a flat morphism of a reduced algebraic variety over [formula] (or a suitably small neighborhood of a compact set of a reduced analytic space) to a non-singular curve C and B  ⊂  X a divisor. Then there exists a projective birational morphism g:Y  →  X from a non-singular Y such that [formula] is an simple-normal-crossing divisor for all c∈C, here Ex(g) represents the exceptional divisor of g.

Let V: = V(F) be the principal divisor of F on X. By Theorem [\ref=Hironaka] above, we may choose a complex manifold Y and a bimeromorphic morphism g:Y  →  X such that [formula] is simple-normal-crossing for every t∈Δ. For simplicity, denote [formula], Yt  =  π- 1(t), [formula], gt = g|Yt:Yt  →  Xt. Thus, Ex(g) + g*V + Yt is simple-normal-crossing for every t∈Δ.

Since a divisor is a finite [formula]linear combination of prime divisors, we may assume that both Ex(g) and [formula] do not contain any irreducible component of Yt whenever t  ≠  0 and |t| < ε0 for some ε0 > 0. Denote Vt = V|Xt and [formula].

The proof is based on the computation of cpt(ft) and cp0(f0). Next, we shall give several lemmas to compute cpt(ft) and cp0(f0).

For any |t| < ε0 and t  ≠  0, gt:Yt  →  Xt gives a log resolution [formula] of (Xt,Vt).

By definition of Ex(g) we have g:Y - Ex(g)  →  X - g(Ex(g)) is an isomorphism. By restriction of g to each fiber, we obtain isomorphisms [formula]. We need to show gt:Yt  →  Xt is a bimeromorphic morphism for any |t| < ε and t  ≠  0.

Since g:Y  →  X is a bimeromorphic morphism, the codimension of g(Ex(g)) in X must greater than 1, hence g(Ex(g)) does not contain any irreducible component of Xt for any t∈Δ. Therefore, [formula] is a Zariski open subset of Xt for any t∈Δ. On the other hand, since Ex(g) does not contain any irreducible component of Yt, so [formula] is also Zariski open in Yt. Thus, gt:Yt  →  Xt is a bimeromorphic morphism for any |t| < ε and t  ≠  0.

Next we will prove this lemma. Assume |t| < ε and t  ≠  0. Since Xt is irreducible, gt is a bimeromorphic morphism, we have Yt is also irreducible. Moreover, by Hironaka resolution theorem, we have [formula] is simple-normal-crossing, so Yt is itself simple-normal-crossing, thus smooth. By the transversal intersection property, we have [formula] is simple-normal-crossing. Since [formula], [formula] is also simple-normal-crossing. Therefore, [formula] is a log resolution of (Xt,Vt), hence we prove the lemma.

According to the lemma above, we calculate cpt(ft) explicitly by the adjunction formula in the following lemma:

Suppose [formula], [formula], where ai,ki are integers, {Ei}mi = 1 are different prime divisors on Y. If |t| < ε0 and t  ≠  0, then we have

Assume |t| < ε and t  ≠  0, then we have

where (Ei)t  =  Ei|Yt. Next we shall calculate KYt / Xt.

For any q∈Yt, denote p: = g(q)∈Xt. Since π is regular at p, we may choose a local coordinate [formula] of X near p such that [formula]. Moreover, we have Yt = g*Xt and Yt is smooth, so [formula] is regular at q, thus we may choose a local coordinate [formula] of Y near q such that [formula]. When xn = t and yn = t, [formula] and [formula] give the local coordinates of Yt and Xt respectively.

Under these local coordinates, we have [formula] since [formula]. Therefore, we have

Hence we have which is equivalent to Jac  g = Jac  gt. Therefore, we have

[formula]

Thus we have

It might happen that (Ei)t is reducible, and has several components. However, for any i  ≠  j since Ei + Ej + Yt is simple-normal-crossing, so [formula], hence (Ei)t and (Ej)t have no component in common, for otherwise [formula].

Therefore, by Proposition [\ref=compute_CSE], for any p∈Xt we have

Hence

Next, let us compute cp0(f0). Suppose [formula], [formula], where X(i1)0 and Y(j1)0 are different components of X0 and Y0. Similarly, we have [formula] is isomorphism, and [formula]. Hence for any 1  ≤  i1  ≤  k, there exists a unique 1  ≤  j1  ≤  l, such that g(j1)0:Y(j1)0  →  X(i1)0 is a bimeromorphic morphism, where X(i1)0 and Y(j1)0 are smooth.

Without lose of generality, we may assume j1 = i1, that is, for any 1  ≤  j  ≤  k, g(j)0:Y(j)0  →  X(j)0 is a bimeromorphic morphism.

Suppose V and X0 have no components in common, otherwise cp0(f0) = 0 and the inequality automatically holds. As a result, [formula] does not contain Y(j)0. Therefore, we have

where (Ei)(j)0: = Ei|Y(j)0.

Using the same argument in the proof of Lemma [\ref=compute_cpnfn], we also have [formula] a log resolution of (X(j)0,V(j)0). Next lemma compute the relative canonical class of (Y(j)0,X(j)0).

For any 1  ≤  j  ≤  k, we have

With no lose of generality, we only need to prove the lemma for j = 1, i.e.

Assume here hi be a nonnegative integer. For any fixed q∈Y(1)0, assume without lose of generality that [formula], and [formula] where s  ≤  l - k is a nonnegative integer.

Since Y0 is simple-normal-crossing, we may choose local coordinates [formula] of Y near q such that Y(l - i + 1)0 = (yn - i = 0) for any 1  ≤  i  ≤  s and Y(1)0  =  (yn = 0). We may also choose local coordinates [formula] of X near p, and a holomorphic function π1 near p such that X(1)0 = (π1 = 0). So [formula] gives a local coordinate of Y(1)0.

For simplicity, Denote [formula]. Let A be the matrix [formula], and let Bi be the matrix [formula].

By the formula above, in a sufficiently small neighborhood Uq of q we have so we may choose a proper π1 such that

For any 1  ≤  i  ≤  n, define ω to be a (n - 1)-form on [formula], the regular set of X(1)0, as

It is easy to check ω is well-defined, and it has no zeroes or poles near p in X(1)0.

Hence we have

As a result, for any 1  ≤  i  ≤  n, we have which is equivalent to

The Laplace expansion along the n-th column of A yields:

[formula]

Hence we have

[formula]

Since the equation above is near q, we have in general

[formula]

which is equivalent to

Hence we prove the lemma.

Based on these lemmas, to finish the proof of theorem [\ref=main_thm_1] we need only to compute cp0(f(j)0). This will be done in the following proof:

For every 1  ≤  j  ≤  k, since Y(j)0 is a component of effective divisor g*X(j)0, so we have Y(j)0  -  g*X(j)0  ≤  0, hence by Lemma [\ref=compute_ky0x0] we have

Suppose p0∈X(j)0, then Proposition [\ref=compute_CSE] implies

[formula]

Thus, to prove Theorem [\ref=main_thm_1], we need only to show

Since cpt(ft) belongs to the finite set [formula], there exists 1  ≤  m0  ≤  m and tn  →  0 such that

and for any n we have ptn belongs to g(Em0).

Since lim n  →    ∞ptn = p0 and g(Em0) is closed, p0 belongs to g(Em0). Hence

Hence we prove Theorem [\ref=main_thm_1].

Complete proof of the main theorem

In the last subsection we proved the semi-continuity for complex singularity exponent when only simple-normal-crossing singularities occur in the central fiber. In this section, we will generalize this result to include all type of singularities occur in X0.

In this subsection, for two continuous functions f,g with non-negative values, the notation [formula] represents that for two if there exists M > 0 such that M  ·  f  ≥  g; the notation f  ≈  g represents that both [formula] and [formula].

We now restate the main theorem:

Suppose [formula] is a holomorphic function, X(i)0 is any irreducible component of X0 containing p0. Denote ft = F|Xt, f(i)0 = F|X(i)0, then the inequality always holds.

By Hironaka resolution theorem ([\cite=hir64]), there exists a log resolution h:(Z,Z0)  →  (X,X0) such that Z is smooth, Ex(h)  ⊂  Z0 and Z0 is simple normal crossing. For simplicity, denote [formula], [formula], V: = V(F) and [formula]. Without loss of generality, suppose i = 1 and h(1)0:Z(1)0  →  X(1)0 is a bimeromorphic morphism. Since Ex(h)  ⊂  Z0, [formula] is an isomorphism. For any t∈Δ  -  {0}, denote [formula].

For any q∈Z(1)0, choose local coordinates of q and h(q), such that [formula] and Z(1)0 = (z1 = 0). When z1 = 0, simple calculations yield where [formula].

By Laplace expansion, [formula], thus [formula]. Hilbert's Nullstellensatz yields [formula], so there exists [formula] and holomorphic functions [formula] such that

Pick [formula], then we have

[formula]

As a result, [formula], so for any small open neighborhood U(1)0 of p0∈X(1)0,

[formula]

where [formula] is a small open neighborhood of h- 1(p0).

By Theorem [\ref=Hironaka], we may choose a complex manifold Y and a bimeromorphic morphism g:Y  →  Z such that [formula] is simple-normal-crossing for every t∈Δ. For simplicity, denote [formula], [formula], [formula], gt = g|Yt:Yt  →  Zt. Without loss of generality, assume g(1)0:Y(1)0  →  Z(1)0 is a bimeromorphic morphism.

Pulling back ([\ref=int_ineq_1]) on Y(1)0 yields:

[formula]

where [formula].

Then

[formula]

By assumption, V(Jac  h) = KZ / X satisfies supp(KZ / X)  ⊂  Ex(h)  ⊂  Z0, so supp(V(Jac  h))  ⊂  Z0, which means [formula].

Suppose [formula], [formula], [formula], where Ei are different prime divisors on Y. Without loss of generality, suppose Y0 contains [formula] but not contains [formula]. Thus li = 0 for any i  ≥  s + 1, since supp(Y(1)0 - g*Z(1)0 + N  ·  g*KZ / X)  ⊂  Y0.

Therefore,

[formula]

While

[formula]

Combining ([\ref=int_ineq_2]), ([\ref=VJac]) and ([\ref=VF]) together, we have

[formula]

On the other hand, Lemma [\ref=compute_cpnfn] implies [formula].

Since cpt(ft) belongs to the finite set [formula], there exists 1  ≤  m0  ≤  m and tn  →  0 with tn  ≠  0 such that

and for any n we have [formula] belongs to Em0. Since tn  ≠  0, [formula], so [formula], i.e. m0  ≥  s + 1.

Since h- 1(p0) is compact, there exists [formula] such that a subsequence of [formula] converges to [formula]. Since g(Em0) is closed and contains every [formula], it must also contains [formula], which means [formula].

Therefore, [formula]. Notice that m0  ≥  s + 1, so lm0 = 0, which means

[formula]

Hence we prove the main theorem.

Proof of the stronger form of the main theorem

The key to the proof of Theorem [\ref=stronger_main_thm] is the ACC for the log canonical threshold, where ACC stands for the ascending chain condition. The ACC for the log canonical threshold was conjectured by Shokurov in [\cite=sho92]. When the dimension is three, Kollár in [\cite=kol94] proves that 1 is not an accumulation point from below and the ACC for the log canonical threshold follows from the results of Alexeev in [\cite=ale94]. Recently, the ACC Conjecture was proved by T. de Fernex, L. Ein, and M. Musta for complete intersections in [\cite=dflm09] and even when X belongs to a bounded family in [\cite=dflm11]. More recently, it was proved for arbitrary varieties by C. Hacon, J. McKernan and C. Xu in [\cite=hmx12].

For every n, the set Tn of all complex singularity exponents cp(f), where f is a holomorphic function on an n-dimensional complex manifold X and p∈V(f), satisfies ACC.

Suppose the conclusion is false, then we can choose a sequence tk∈Δ with lim k  →    ∞tk = 0, such that cptk(ftk) < cp0(f0). By Theorem [\ref=main_thm], we have Thus we can choose a subsequence {sl} of {tk} such that {cpsl(fsl)} is a strictly increasing sequence, which contradicts Theorem [\ref=acc].

Stability of integrals along fibers

Recall that Theorem [\ref=semicont_smooth] not only proves the lower semi-continuity property of complex singularity exponents, but also shows the stability of integrals with respect to continuous parameters. In this section, we present the proof of Theorem [\ref=eff_irreducible], which shows the stability of integrals along fibers in some 2-dimensional cases.

We fix some notations throughout this section. Suppose X = D0(R0,R0), Δ = B0(R20) where R0 > 0. Here [formula] is an open polydisc in [formula], [formula] is an open disc in [formula]. Suppose π(x,y) = xy , Xt  =  π- 1(t). Let F be a holomorphic function defined on X such that F is not identical to zero on each irreducible components of Xt for every t∈Δ. Define ft = F|Xt. Suppose U = D0(R,R) with 0 < R  ≤  R0, [formula].

Let g be the restriction of the Euclidean metric on [formula] to X, which means that [formula]. Define X*t to be the smooth locus of Xt, hence X*t is a complex manifold, and for t  ≠  0 we have X*t = Xt. Define dVt to be the volume form of g|X*t on X*t.

The following lemma provide basic calculations about dVt:

Define [formula], similarly for dVy. Then on [formula], we have Define annulus [formula]. Define Then we have

The proof is quite straight forward, so we omit it.

Let [formula] be the ring of power series of x,y in complex coefficients which is convergent in some neighborhood of [formula]. Weierstrass preparation theorem implies that [formula] is a UFD.

The key to the proof of Theorem [\ref=eff_irreducible] is the following:

If [formula] is irreducible, then the Newton polygon of f contains only one segment.

Since F is not identically to zero on each components of X0, F must contain monomials of xk and yl for some k and l.

By Weierstrass preparation theorem, there exists [formula] with h(0,0)  ≠  0 and Weierstrass polynomials F1(x) and F2(y) such that F = h1  ·  F1 = h2  ·  F2. For sufficiently small R, h1 and h2 are both nonzero in D0(R,R), with |h1|, |h2|, |h- 11| and |h- 12| all less than M in D0(R,R).

According to Lemma [\ref=newton_polygon], the Newton polygon γ of F contains only one segment. Denote the two endpoints of γ to be (k,0) and (0,l). It is easy to see that the Newton polygons of F1 and F2 are the same as γ.

Choose [formula] such that t = sk + l, and y: = t / x, z: = x / sl, w: = y / sk, so xy = t and zw = 1.

Notice that the theorem is equivalent to lim t  →  0Kt(R) = K0(R). By symmetry of x and y, we need only to prove lim t  →  0It(R) = I0(R). Next, we use parameters (z,w) to express It(R).

[formula]

To prove the theorem, we divide the integral domain [formula] to three separately parts [formula], [formula] and [formula]. Denote

[formula]

So It(R) = It,1(R,R1) + It,2(R,R1) + It,3(R,R1). Similarly we denote Jt,i(R,R1) by interchange z and w.

We shall estimate It,1(R,R1) at first. Suppose [formula], let [formula] be the sum of monomials of F that occur in γ.

Thus,

[formula]

Here [formula] is a holomorphic function of s, z and w.

For every R1 > 1, H1(s,z,w) is bounded for small |s| and [formula]. Therefore, as s  →  0 we have the following uniform convergence:

Here we treat z as a single variable for w = 1 / z.

Notice that G1(z,w) is a quasi-homogeneous polynomial of z,w which contains monomials zk and wl, thus the order of zero point of F1(z,1 / z) is at most max {k,l}. Here we assume [formula], so

Therefore, we have the following equality by using Theorem [\ref=semicont_smooth]:

Because 2l - 2klc = 2l(1 - kc) > 0, lim s  →  0|s|2l - 2klc = 0, thus

Since [formula], we have

[formula]

Hence we have

[formula]

Next, we shall estimate It,2(R,R1).

Since F1(z,w) is a Weierstrass polynomial of z, we have deg zH1(s,z,w)  ≤  k - 1.

Let [formula]. When |s| < δ1, |z|  ≥  R1 for some δ1 > 0, R1 > 1,

[formula]

Here C(δ1,R1) is a constant depending on δ1 and R1, and C(δ1,R1)  ≥  C(δ1',R1') if δ1  ≥  δ1' and R1  ≤  R1'.

Therefore, for every 0 < ε1 < 1 and any fixed δ1 > 0, there exists R1 sufficiently large such that for every |z|  ≥  R1 and |s|  ≤  δ1 we have

On the other hand, since G1 is a quasi-homogeneous polynomial of z and w, and G1 is monic of z, we have

So when R1 is sufficiently large, for every |z|  ≥  R1 we have

Since [formula], we can pick R1 sufficiently large and δ1 > 0, such that for every |z|  ≥  R1 and |s|  ≤  δ1, we have which also means

Therefore, for every |s|  ≤  δ1 we have

[formula]

Notice that

If |x|  ≥  |s|lR1, then |t / x|  ≤  |s|k / R1  ≤  |s|k. So there exists δ2∈(0,δ1) such that for any [formula] and |s|  ≤  δ2, we have which also means

Therefore, we have

[formula]

Combining ([\ref=eq:it2a]) and ([\ref=eq:it2b]) together, we have

It is easy to see that

Therefore, we have the following two inequalities.

[formula]

[formula]

Finally, we shall estimate It,3(R,R1). We have the following equality:

[formula]

We define G2(z,w) and H2(s,z,w) similarly. Because of the same reason in the discussion about It,1(R,R1), for ε1 > 0 there exists sufficiently large R1 such that for any [formula], we have

So for any [formula], we have

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

Notice that [formula], so which means

[formula]

Combining ([\ref=eq:it1]), ([\ref=eq:it2g]), ([\ref=eq:it2l]) and ([\ref=eq:it3]) together, we have

[formula]

Similarly,

[formula]

When ε1  →  0, the limits of ([\ref=eq:itleps]) and ([\ref=eq:itgeps]) are the following: which means

Hence we finish the proof.

At the end of this section, we may show the existence of uniform upper bounds for integrals along fibers as a direct corollary of Theorem [\ref=eff_irreducible].

For any [formula] and any 0 < c < c0(f0), there exists U = D0(R,R), δ > 0 and M = M(R,F,c,δ) > 0, such that the inequality holds for all |t|  ≤  δ.

If Theorem [\ref=eff_dim_2] is true for F1 and F2, then it is also true for F: = F1  ·  F2.

Suppose [formula], then the multiplicity of F at 0 when restricts to X0 is at least l: = l1 + l2, thus [formula].

For every [formula], by Young's inequality we have

Here [formula].

Hence for every |t| <  min (δ1,δ2),

[formula]

Define [formula], hence Theorem [\ref=eff_dim_2] is true for F.

Let [formula].

By Theorem [\ref=eff_irreducible], S contains all irreducible elements of [formula]; by Lemma [\ref=eff_reducible], S is closed under multiplication. Since [formula] is a UFD, we have [formula], which means that Theorem [\ref=eff_dim_2] is true for every [formula].

The proof of Theorem [\ref=eff_irreducible] cannot be generalized to higher dimensions directly, since Lemma [\ref=newton_polygon] is usually false in higher dimensions.

Counterexamples in non-holomorphic families

In Section [\ref=sect_3], we prove the semi-continuity of complex singularity exponents for holomorphic families. However, Example [\ref=counterex_1] shows that this is not true for non-holomorphic families. Moreover, we construct a sequence of counterexamples (see Example [\ref=counterex_n]) to the semi-continuity property for non-holomorphic families in this section. The families in Example [\ref=counterex_n] are [formula] for arbitrary large n but not C∞.

For every [formula], define [formula], then Vn is a complex linear subspace of [formula] with dim Vn = 2n + 3. Define Wn: = {P(z)∈Vn:(z - 1)2n + 2|P(z)}. We have Wn  ≠  0 because dim Vn = 2n + 3 > 2n + 2 =  deg (z - 1)2n + 2.

Let [formula] contains a polynomial Pn(z) with the z4n + 2 term and constant term both nonzero.}, then N is an infinite set.

Suppose the conclusion is not true, then there exists [formula] such that for every n  ≥  N and every nonzero Pn(z)∈Wn, at least one of z4n + 2 term and constant term of Pn vanishes.

Let us fix n > N sufficiently large. If the constant term of Pn is nonzero and the z4n + 2 term of Pn is zero, let [formula], then of course [formula], thus [formula] with z4n + 2 term and constant term both nonzero, which contradicts to our assumption. Hence the constant term of Pn must vanish, so does the z4n + 2 term.

Because the z4n + 2 term and constant term of Pn both vanishes, Pn(z) / z2 must belong to Wn - 1, then we may denote Pn - 1(z): = Pn(z) / z2. After same argument applying to Pn - 1, we will get Pn - 2(z): = Pn - 1(z) / z2∈Wn - 2. Repeat this process to Pn - k for k = n - N, finally we have that Pn(z) = z2k  ·  Pn - k(z) and Pn - k∈Wn - k.

Since [formula], we have (z - 1)2n + 2|Pn - k(z), thus 2n + 2  ≤   deg Pn - k  ≤  4N + 2, i.e. n  ≤  2N, which contradicts to our assumption that n can be sufficiently large. Hence the lemma is proved.

Next, we construct a sequence of counterexamples to the semi-continuity property for non-holomorphic families.

We shall estimate c(s,s)(Fn|Xt) first.

[formula]

Thus, we have

[formula]

On the other hand, Fn(x,y) = Qn(x,y) is a homogenous polynomial with degree 2n + 1 when xy = 0. Besides, x2n + 1 term and y2n + 1 term both occur in Qn(x,y). Consequently, [formula], hence we finish our proof.

Next proposition shows that for any n∈N, [formula] and [formula], hence Fn is not holomorphic.

For every n∈N, [formula] while [formula].

We notice that Qn(x,y) is a homogeneous polynomial of x,y, so [formula]. Thus to prove the proposition it is sufficient to prove that [formula].

It can be easily verified that [formula] for every [formula] and 0 < α < 1, so [formula]. By composing [formula] with the C∞ function z = xy, we have [formula]. It can also be easily verified that [formula], thus we prove the proposition.

Since N is an infinite set, for any [formula] there exists n∈N and n > N such that [formula]. Thus the families in Example [\ref=counterex_n] are [formula] for arbitrary large n but not C∞.
