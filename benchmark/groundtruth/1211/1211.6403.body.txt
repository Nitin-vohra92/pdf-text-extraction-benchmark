Abstract. We give a new explicitly invertible approximation of the normal cumulative distribution function: [formula], [formula], with absolute error < 4.00  ·  10- 5, absolute value of the relative error < 4.53  ·  10- 5, which, beeing designed essentially for practical use, is much simpler than a previously published formula and, though less precise, still reaches 4 decimals of precision, and has a complexity essentially comparable with that of the approximation of the normal cumulative distribution function Φ(x) immediatly derived from Winitzki's approximation of erf(x), reducing about 36% the absolute error and about 28% the relative error with respect to that, overcoming the threshold of 4 decimals of precision.

This paper is devoted to approximate some special functions, in particular the normal cumulative distribution function.

Though computers now allow to compute them with arbitrary precision, such approximations are still worth for several reasons, including to catch the soul of the considered functions, allowing to understand at a glance their behaviour. Let's add that, despite technologic progress, those functions - of wide practical use - not always are available on pocket calculators. In practice, the ancient numerical tables are still widely used; but they give approximations only for some values and, if linearly interpolating to approximate intermediate values, both precision and simplicity of use reduce. And surely by computers you may obtain graphs of those functions, but for a mathematician the meaning content of formuls is greater.

Furthermore, here we produce an explicitly invertible (and, in fact, simply) approximation, which allow to keep coherence working contemporarily with the considered function and its inverse.

For the [\cite=Wiki1] [\cite=Wolfram1] special functions

[formula]

and the related error function [formula] [formula], there are several approximations; in particular see classical [\cite=Abramowitz] [\cite=Hart] [\cite=Balakrishnan] and recent [\cite=Dyer] [\cite=SoranzoEpure] [\cite=Winitzki] [\cite=ZogheibHlynka]; approximations for x  ≥  0 are sufficient because of the symmetry formula Φ( - x) = 1 - Φ(x) [formula].

Restricting now our attention only to those approximations which are simply explicitly invertible - in the sense, explicitly invertible without requiring to solve cubic or quartic equations - the most precise appears to be [\cite=SoranzoEpure]

[formula]

which is an improvement preserving (despite the adding of the quartic monomial) the simple explicit invertibility (essential solving a biquadratic equation after obvious substitutions) of this approximation of Φ

[formula]

immediately derived by [formula] [formula] from this [\cite=Winitzki] Winitzki's Approximation of erf

[formula]

In this note we give this new (simply) explicitly invertible approximation of the normal cumulative distribution function

[formula]

which, beeing designed essentially for practical use,

[formula] is much simpler than ([\ref=eq:Wini1.2735457]) and, though less precise, still reaches 4 decimals of precision;

[formula] has a complexity essentially comparable with that of ([\ref=eq:Wini735]) reducing about 36% the absolute error and about 28% the relative error with respect to that, overcoming the threshold of 4 decimals of precision.

Instead, the corresponding approximation of erf is not so worth, because, though reduces about 36% the absolute error of ([\ref=eq:Wini147]), it remains with the precision of 3 decimals, and furthermore the absolute value of the relative error |εr(x)| < 1.79  ·  10- 4 is quite greater than in ([\ref=eq:Wini147]).

See below the graphs (made by Mathematica [formula]) of the approximation, of the absolute error and of the absolute value of the relative error for 0  ≤  x  ≤  7. For x  ≥  7 the trivial approximation Φ(x)≃1 has absolute error and absolute value of the relative error highly less than 4  ·  10- 5 and 4.53  ·  10- 5 respectively. (Nevertheless, if interested in a formal proof of the majorization |ε(x)|  <  4  ·  10- 5 for x  ≥  7, you may follow [\cite=SoranzoEpure]).
