Exceptional Prime Number Twins, Triplets and Multiplets

Introduction

Prime numbers have long fascinated people. Much is known about ordinary primes [\cite=hw], much less about prime twins and mostly from sieve methods, and almost nothing about longer prime number multiplets. If primes and their multiplets are considered as the elements of the integers, then the aspects to be discussed in the following might be seen as part of a "periodic table" for them.

When dealing with prime number twins, triplets and/or multiplets, it is standard practice to ignore as trivial the prime pairs (2,p) of odd distance p - 2 with p any odd prime. In the following prime number multiplets will consist of odd primes only.

A generalized twin prime consists of a pair of primes pi,pf at distance pf - pi = 2D  ≥  2. Ordinary twins are those at distance 2D = 2.

A classification of twin primes

A triplet pi,pm = pi + 2d1,pf = pm + 2d2 of prime numbers with pi < pm < pf is characterized by two distances d1,d2. Each triplet consists of three generalized twin primes [formula]. Empirical laws governing triplets therefore are intimately tied to those of the generalized twin primes.

There is a basic parametrization of twin primes which generalizes to all prime number multiplets[\cite=hjw1],[\cite=hjw2].

Let 2D be the distance between two odd prime numbers pi,pf of the pair, D a natural number. There are three mutually exlusive classes of generalized twin primes.

[formula]

where a is the running integer variable. Values of a for which a prime pair of distance 2D is reached are unpredictable (called arithmetic chaos).

Only in class II are there special twins 3,3 + 2D with a median 3 + D not of the form 3(2a - 1).

Each of these three classes contains infinitely many (possibly empty) subsets of prime pairs at various even distances.

Proof. Let us first consider the case of odd D. Then pi = 2a - D for some positive integer a and, therefore, pf = pi + 2D = 2a + D. The median 2a is the running integer variable of this class I.

For even D with D not divisible by 3 let pi = 2n + 1 - D, so pf = 2n + 1 + D for an appropriate integer n. Let pi  ≠  3, excluding a possible first pair with pi = 3 as special. Since one of three odd natural numbers at distance D from each other is divisible by 3, the median 2n + 1 must be so, hence 2n + 1 = 3(2a - 1) for an appropriate integer a  ≥  2. Thus, the median 3(2a - 1) of the pair 3(2a - 1)  ±  D is again a linear function of a running integer variable a. These prime number pairs constitute the 2nd class II.

This argument is not valid for prime number pairs with 6|D, but these can obviously be parametrized as 2a + 1  ±  6d, ~ D = 6d. They comprise the 3rd and last class III of generalized twins. Obviously these three classes are mutually exclusive and complete.[formula]

Ordinary twins 2a  ±  1 for [formula] have D = 1 and are in class I. For D = 3, the twins 2a  ±  3 occur for [formula] For D = 5, the twins 2a  ±  5 are at [formula]

For D = 2, the twins 3(2a - 1)  ±  2 for [formula] are in class II.

For D = 6, the twins 2a + 1  ±  6 for [formula] are in class III.

Special twins are the following prime number pairs 5  ±  2 = (3,7);7  ±  4 = (3,11);11  ±  8 = (3,19); etc.

How many special prime pairs are there? Since 3 + 2D forms an arithmetic progression with greatest common divisor (3,2D) = 1, Dirichlet's theorem [\cite=hw] on arithmetic progressions says there are infinitely many of them.

Theor. [\ref=2.1] tells us that all triplets are in precisely one of nine classes [formula] which are labeled according to the class of their prime pairs. Quartets are distributed over 33 classes, n - tuples over 3n - 1 classes.

It is well known that, except for the first pair 3,5, ordinary twins all have the form (6m - 1,6m + 1) for some natural number m. They belong to class I. Using Theor. [\ref=2.1], a second classification of generalized twins involving arithmetic progressions of conductor 6 as their regular feature may be obtained [\cite=hjw1].

.

Prime pairs at distance 2D = 4 are in class II and of the form 6m + 1,6(m + 1) - 1 for [formula] except for the singlet 3,7. At distance 2D = 6 they are in class I and have the form 6m - 1,6(m + 1) - 1 for [formula] that are intertwined with 6m + 1,6(m + 1) + 1 for [formula] At distance 2D = 12 they are in class III and of the form 6m - 1,6(m + 2) - 1 for [formula] intertwined with 6m + 1,6(m + 2) + 1 for [formula]

Clearly, the rules governing the form 6m  ±  1,6m + b depend on the arithmetic of D and a.

Exceptional prime number triplets

Let us start with some prime number triplet examples.

The triplet ~ 3,5,7 is the only one at distances ; the triplet 3,7,11 is the only one at distances , and 3,11,19 is the only one at distances , and 3,13,23 is the only at , etc. Let's call such triplets at equal distances

[formula]

There are other classes of singlets. At distances , the prime triplet 3,5,13 is the only one at distances

Exceptional prime number multiplets

It is obvious that induced special multiplets come about by adding a prime pf to a special twin 3,3 + 2D = pm in class II with pm - D = 3 + D  ≠  3(2a - 1). This yields an induced special triplet 3,pm = 3 + 2D,pf. Adding another prime generates an induced special quartet, etc.

There are no prime multiplets at equal distance 2D,[formula] except triplets, because no other primes can be added at that distance, obviously. But there are quartets at equal distance 2D,3|D. They are in class [formula] in class [formula] at equal distance D with 6|D, etc. (Probably there is an infinite number of them.)

Thus, there are no exceptional quartets at equal distance. Likewise, there are no exceptional 6 - tuples or q - tuples at equal distance, when q has more than one prime divisor.

The exceptional quintet at equal distance is [formula] There are no other such quintets, because one of 5 odd numbers at distance [formula] is divisible by 5.

For 7 the exceptional septet is 7,157,307,457,607,757,907, at a surprisingly large distance.

For the primes 11,13,19 there are 6 - tuples [formula] and a 7 - tuple [formula] for 17, but the exceptional 11 - ,13 - ,17 - ,19 - tuples are still at large, if they exist.

These are special cases of the following rule for exceptional multiplets.

there is at most an exceptional p - tuple [formula] at equal distance [formula]

Proof. A p - tuple composed of primes is exceptional, because one of any p odd numbers at equal distance [formula] is divisible by [formula]

When q has several prime divisors, there are no new exceptional q - tuples at equal distance.

Next we generalize item (ii) of Theor. [\ref=3.1] to quartets and subsequently higher multiplets.

Exceptional quartets with [formula] are possible that are induced by triplets, etc.

New exceptional quartets at distances

[formula]

Proof. This is clear from the proof of (ii) in Theor. [\ref=3.1]. [formula]

The generalization to higher multiplets is straightforward and left to the reader.

We conclude with an open question. Apart from exceptional multiplets, do all other multiplets repeat their pattern of given differences infinitely often?
