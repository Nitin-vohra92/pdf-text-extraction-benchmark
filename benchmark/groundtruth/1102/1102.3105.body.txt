Weighted hypersurfaces with either assigned volume or many vanishing plurigenera

Introduction

Let X be a smooth variety of general type (we always intend projective over [formula]). Since the canonical divisor KX is intrinsically associated to X, the study of the pluricanonical systems |rKX|, of the induced maps φr, and of the canonical ring [formula] is a classical and important matter. Further these objects are birational invariants.

It is natural to ask how "small" can the Hilbert function of R(X) be. There are many different possible definition of "small"; we are mainly interested in two of them. First, we would like to consider varieties of small canonical volume. Recall that [formula], so making the volume small is the same as making small the asymptotical behaviour of the Hilbert function. Second, we would like to understand which plurigenera Pm: = h0(X,mKX) may be zero.

For curves of general type vol(X)  ≥  2 and KX is effective; for surfaces vol(X)  ≥  1 and P2  ≠  0, while there are surfaces of general type with P1 = 0. For threefolds the record from both points of view is attained by an example of Iano-Fletcher (see 15.1 of [\cite=If]) with volume [formula] and P1 = P2 = P3 = 0. See also [\cite=chensquare1] and [\cite=chensquare2] for related results in dimension 3.

In higher dimension we are able to prove the following.

Let n  ≥  5 be an integer. There exists a smooth variety of general type X of dimension n such that H0(X,mKX) = 0 for [formula] and [formula].

Recently the following result, generalisation of a famous theorem of [\cite=bo], was proven in [\cite=HM], [\cite=Tak] and [\cite=Tsu].

A consequence of this theorem is that for any smooth variety of general type X of dimension n we have

[formula]

and that the set of the volumes of the manifolds of general type of dimension n has a minimum vn > 0.

An instant consequence of Theorem [\ref=thm3] is the following

Let vn be the minimal volume of an n-dimensional smooth variety of general type. Then lim n  →    ∞vn = 0.

A natural problem is to estimate rn. It is well known that r1 = 3 and r2 = 5. By the mentioned example of Iano-Fletcher we know that r3  ≥  27 (see 15.1 of [\cite=If]). Let x'n be the minimal positive integer such that for every n-dimensional smooth variety X of general type there is an integer t  ≤  x'n such that φt is generically finite; obviously rn  ≥  xn'.

The examples of Theorem [\ref=thm3] provide a lower bound for xn' (and therefore for rn) which is quadratic in n. More precisely

For any integer n  ≥  7 we have

[formula]

In particular

[formula]

The canonical system of these varieties is not ample. In view of Fujita's conjecture, smooth varieties with ample canonical system should not give anything better than a linear bound. We show

For any positive integer n > 0 there is a smooth variety X of dimension n such that KX is ample and φ|tKX| is not birational for t < n + 3 if n is even or t < n + 2 if n is odd.

The idea of this example is taken from [\cite=Ka], Example 3.1 (2).

These bounds are optimal up to dimension 3 (for the three dimensional case see [\cite=CCZ]). Note that the bound for n even is the same predicted by Fujita's conjecture for the very ampleness, while for n odd is one less.

Let r'n be the minimal positive integer such that for every n-dimensional smooth variety X of general type there is an integer r  ≤  r'n such that |rKX| induces a birational map. Let xn be the minimal integer such that for every n-dimensional smooth variety of general type and every integer t  ≥  xn the map induced by |tKX| is generically finite. Of course rn  ≥  r'n  ≥  x'n, rn  ≥  xn  ≥  x'n. It is also natural to study the behaviour of these numbers.

Taking X  =  Y  ×  C with C a smooth curve of genus 2 and Y a smooth variety of general type we get rn  ≥  rn - 1 and r'n  ≥  r'n - 1 for all n  ≥  2.

Is rn + 1  >  rn for all n? Is r'n + 1  >  r'n for all n?

All our examples satisfy hi(X,OX) = 0 for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  n - 1. Manifolds X with the property hi(X,OX) = 0 for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  n - 1 are very special, but it may be worthwhile to fix the integer q: = h1(X,OX) and study the integers rn(q), r'n(q), xn(q), x'n(q) (rn(  ≥  q), r'n(  ≥  q), xn(  ≥  q), x'n(  ≥  q) and rn(  ≤  q), r'n(  ≤  q), xn(  ≤  q), x'n(  ≤  q)) obtained taking only manifolds with irregularity q (resp. ≥  q, resp. ≤  q). Taking X  =  Y  ×  D with D a curve of genus x  ≥  2 we get rn(q)  ≥  rn - 1(q - x) for all integers n  ≥  2 and q,x such that 2  ≤  x  ≤  q (and similarly for the other integers rn'(q)).

Our last result is that every positive rational number is a canonical volume:

Let q = r / s be a rational number with r,s > 0 and (r,s) = 1. There are infinite positive integers n such that there is a smooth variety of dimension n with

[formula]

This research started from a question of R. Ghiloni on the asymptotical behaviour of rn: we thank him heartily.

The proofs

We will need the following lemma.

Let [formula] be a well-formed weighted projective space. If the coordinate points are canonical singularities then all the singularities of [formula] are canonical.

Let P be a singular point of [formula]. Define [formula] and let S  ⊂  U be the subset of the variables nonzero at P. By hypothesis, if #  S = 1, then P is a canonical singularity. Assume then #  S > 1.

We denote by hS the highest common factor of the set {ai|i∈S}. Then hS > 1 and, chosen a k∈S, P is a cyclic quotient singularity of type

[formula]

By the criterium of [\cite=Re], page 376, P is a canonical singularity if and only if

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the smallest (non negative) residue of a  hS.

We argue by contradiction. Suppose

[formula]

Take a k∈S. Then ak = mhS for a positive integer m. Note that mj  <  ak. Then we have

[formula]

which contradicts the hypothesis.

Let k  ≥  2 and l  ≥  0 be integers. Consider the weighted projective space

[formula]

Then the general hypersurface Xd in [formula] of degree d: = (l + 3)k(k + 1) has at worst canonical singularities, KXd  ~  OXd(1), dim Xd = 3k + l - 1 and

[formula]

The weighted projective space [formula] is well-formed since k  ≥  2. We use the criterium of [\cite=Re], page 376, to control that the singularities of [formula] are canonical. By the previous lemma it is enough to look at the coordinates points. They are of three types.

The singularities of type

[formula]

We have to check that

[formula]

for 1  ≤  j  ≤  k - 1, where [formula] denotes the smallest (non negative) residue  k. This is trivial since [formula] for 1  ≤  j  ≤  k - 1.

The singularities of type

[formula]

We have to check that

[formula]

for 1  ≤  j  ≤  k, where [formula] denotes the smallest (non negative) residue  k + 1. This is trivial since [formula] for 1  ≤  j  ≤  k.

The singularities of type

[formula]

when l  ≥  1. We have to check that

[formula]

for 1  ≤  i  ≤  k(k + 1) - 1, where [formula] denotes the smallest (non negative) residue  k(k + 1). This follows since [formula] then [formula] and if [formula] then [formula].

Now note that [formula] is base point free (since d is a multiple of every weight) and locally free (by Lemma 1.3 of [\cite=Mo]).

Then we can apply a Kollár-Bertini theorem (Proposition 7.7 of [\cite=Ko], see also Theorem 1.3 of [\cite=ReiCan]) to conclude that the general hypersurface Xd of degree d is canonical (and obviously well-formed and quasi-smooth, cf. [\cite=If]).

Finally, by adjunction (6.14 of [\cite=If]), KXd  ~  OX(1) and so

[formula]

Write n = 3k + l - 1, with integers k  ≥  2 and 0  ≤  l  ≤  2, so [formula]. We can apply the previous proposition to obtain a canonical variety Xd of dimension n in the projective space

[formula]

By Theorem 3.4.4 (and the proof of the lemma above) in [\cite=Do] we deduce that

[formula]

for 0 < m < k.

Moreover

[formula]

Take as X any desingularization of Xd.

Let n = 3k + l - 1, with integers k  ≥  2 and 2  ≤  l  ≤  4 so [formula]. We can apply the proposition [\ref=prop] to obtain a canonical variety Xd of dimension n in the projective space

[formula]

We denote the coordinates of this space zi for 0  ≤  i  ≤  n + 1. Recall that KXd  ~  OXd(1).

Fix t  <  k(k + 1). Thanks to Proposition 3.3 of [\cite=Mo] we get

[formula]

but the last two variable zn and zn + 1 can't appear in an element of [formula] for degree's reasons.

Take as X any desingularization of Xd. Then the map induced by |tKX| is not generically finite. In particular

[formula]

We first consider the case n even. Let d = n + 3 and let [formula] the weighted projective space [formula]. The coherent sheaf [formula] is a line bundle ([\cite=Mo], Lemma 1.5). We call the coordinates of this space zi for 0  ≤  i  ≤  n + 1. Since d is odd the general weighted hypersurface X of degree 2d do not meet the singularities of [formula] and it is smooth. Note that its equation is of the form

[formula]

where P is a polynomial of weighted degree 2d. Moreover we have KX  ~  OX(1).

If we take a positive integer t  <  d, then the linear system |tKX| does not induce a birational map. Indeed by Proposition 3.3 of [\cite=Mo] we have

[formula]

but the variable zn + 1 can't appear in an element of [formula] for degree's reasons and so the induced map has at least degree 2.

If n = 1 we use a smooth curve of genus 2. If n is odd and n  ≥  3 we consider a manifold Y of dimension n - 1 such that rn  ≥  n + 2 and define X: = Y  ×  C where C is smooth curve of genus 2. Alternatively, for n odd, take d = n + 2 and a general hypersurface of degree 2d in [formula].

Let b be a positive integer such that

[formula]

and write

[formula]

Let a be a positive integer such that (a,s) = (a,b) = 1.

We set

[formula]

[formula]

Observe that choosing a and b we can have n arbitrarily large. Hence we may assume n  ≥  3.

Note that (a,s) = (a,b) = (s,b) = 1, hence the only singularities of [formula] are P = (0(n - 2),0,1,0), Q = (0(n - 2),1,0,0) and R = (0(n - 2),0,0,1).

Now consider a general weighted hypersurface Xd of degree d in [formula]. The sheaf [formula] is locally free and spanned outside P. By Bertini's theorem applied to [formula] we get that Xd is smooth outside P. Since [formula], a|d and b|d, so P∈Xd while Q,R∉Xd. Since n  ≥  3 and Xd has a unique singular point, it is well-formed in the sense of [\cite=If].

We will show that for a and b large enough, Xd is a (well-formed) quasi-smooth variety with at most a terminal singularity in P. Then we would have finished. Indeed note that by adjunction (6.14 of [\cite=If]) KX  ~  OX(1) is ample and therefore

[formula]

To control the quasi-smoothness we use criterium 8.1 of [\cite=If].

Let [formula] be the coordinates of [formula]. For every [formula] except I = {n} the condition 2.a of 8.1 in [\cite=If] is satisfied because the only variable whose degree doesn't divide d is zn. In the case I = {n} we can use 2.b since d = tas  +  a and we can take the monomial

[formula]

Since Xd is quasi-smooth its singularities are induced by those of [formula] and so we have only to control that Xd is terminal in P.

Let f = 0 be an equation of Xd. We can write

[formula]

We consider the affine piece (zn = 1). The point P∈Xd looks like

[formula]

where ε is a primitive s-th root of unity and acts via

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

Note that ∂f  /  ∂zn - 1  ≠  0 in P, hence, by the Inverse Function Theorem, zi are local coordinates for P in Xd for i  ≠  n - 1,n. This gives a quotient singularity of type

[formula]

By the criterium of [\cite=Re], page 376, if n - 2  ≥  s then P is terminal.

Now you can simply take a desingularization of Xd.
