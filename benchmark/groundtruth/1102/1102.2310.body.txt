Non-equilibrium hadronization and constituent quark number scaling

Introduction

It has been observed that the momentum distribution of particles created in heavy ion collisions is not azimuthally symmetric in the plane perpendicular to the beam direction. This dominant asymmetry, the elliptic flow, is the result of several factors, the main one being the anisotropy of the initial configuration after the collision due to the non-zero impact parameter. The elliptic flow is typically characterized using the second coefficient of the Fourier expansion of the momentum distribution, v2. It was found in experiments [\cite=CQNS] that the v2 parameter as a function of the transverse momentum, [formula], scales with the number of constituent quarks, ncq, in a hadron. That is, if the [formula] curves are re-scaled according to the constituent quark number of the considered hadron species, and v2 / ncq is plotted as function of [formula] for each type of hadron with mass mh, the curves will coincide. Later results showed that the scaling is more precise if v2 is plotted as a function of the transverse kinetic energy, [formula], instead of the transverse momentum .

This experimentally found scaling law is remarkably simple, and indicates that the elliptic flow develops before the quarks recombine into hadrons. Therefore, understanding the factors influencing the measurable v2 can provide information about the state of the Quak Gluon Plasma (QGP).

The fluid dynamical (FD) model describes the dynamical development of the QGP from the (already thermalized) initial state until the break-down of the equilibrium, where first the chemical equilibrium among quarks and anti-quarks ceases. Initially the plasma has only two flavors, u and d, and thus the FD model assumes two flavors. However, the flavor equilibration in the plasma is a rapid process with a timescale of the order of 1  fm / c, so by the end of the FD development a flavor equilibrium among three flavors, u, d, and s, is reached. Our usual FD evolution does not take into account this chemical change of flavors with an additional rate equation, instead this process is taken into account at the final stage of the FD development, when the subsequent EoS is already assumed to have three equilibrated flavors. Energy and momentum conservation and the requirement of non-decreasing entropy is enforced in the transition, from the ideal QGP state to the state where quark and anti-quark numbers are frozen out. As a consequence, the mass change of the quarks starts in the initial QGP with two flavors, and we use this approximation to estimate in Section II.B the final boundary where the initial FD stage of the evolution ends, with light quark masses.

We consider a model of hadronization and investigate the constituent quark number scaling (QNS) of the v2 parameter. In this model, a gas of quarks and anti-quarks expands in a background field represented by the Bag constant B, which depends on density and temperature of the expanding fireball. Initially this B-field includes the energy of the deconfined perturbative vacuum and of the gluon fields. As the system expands the deconfinement starts and the average B decreases. Furthermore, as the chiral symmetry breaking starts, the quarks gain mass. The quark mass is calculated as a function of the temperature and density of the matter. The quark gas expands rapidly while the quark mass increases. This process can be considered as a simple representation of the breaking chiral symmetry and deconfinement in a dynamical transition crossing the Quarkyonic phase [\cite=McLerran_Pisarski].

The point during the expansion when the quarks recombine into hadrons is determined from the condition that the average hadron energy is equivalent to [formula], as found from the systematics of experimental data [\cite=Cleymans]. At recombination, the thermal and flow equilibrium between particles is broken.

Finally, the v2 parameter is determined using simple two- and three-source models of the elliptic flow and the particle distributions obtained from the hadronization model.

The paper is organized as follows: In Section [\ref=A] the density and temperature dependence of constituent quark mass is considered. The energy, entropy, momentum and chemical potential of each individual source and of the total source is given in Section [\ref=B]. In Section [\ref=C] we describe the applied non-equilibrium model of rapid hadronization. Details of calculation of elliptic flow parameter v2 are presented in Section [\ref=D]. A summary is given in Section [\ref=E].

Constituent quark mass

To present our arguments we consider the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model (NJL) which is motivated by Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and is basically a purely quark-quark-interaction theory; a comprehensive overview about NJL has been presented in [\cite=Klevansky]. The extended NJL-model contains three types of quark-quark-interaction and is given by the Lagrangian

[formula]

where [formula], γμ are the Dirac matrices, mf is the current quark mass of flavor f, GS is the coupling constant of the scalar-current interaction, GV is the coupling constant of the vector-current interaction terms and GD is the coupling constant of the determinantal flavor-mixing term (determinant in flavor space). The Gell-Mann matrices are λa where [formula] with [formula], where I is the unit matrix. This Lagrangian is used to derive the relation between constituent quark masses and chiral condensates, both for vacuum and for finite densities and temperatures.

Constituent quark mass in vacuum

First, we consider the constituent quark mass in vacuum. For three flavors, SUf(3), the constituent quark masses in vacuum [formula] where f = u,d,s, are related to the ciral condensates in vacuum as follows [\cite=Vogel_Weise] [\cite=MishustinCQ] [\cite=LiShakin]

[formula]

Here [formula] and so on, mu  =  5  MeV,md  =  9  MeV and ms  =  130  MeV are the current quark masses of the u-quark, d-quark and s-quark, respectively. Typical values of the chiral condensates in vacuum are given by, e.g. [\cite=Cohen_Furnstahl1] [\cite=Cohen_Furnstahl2] and references therein:

[formula]

Typical values for the coupling constants are GS  =  (15  -  20)  GeV- 2, GV≃0.5  GS and GD  =    -  (160  -  240)  GeV- 5 [\cite=Klevansky] [\cite=MishustinCQ] [\cite=LiShakin]. We note that in relations ([\ref=Eq_23]) - ([\ref=Eq_25]) the magnitude of terms proportional to GD are small compared to the terms proportional to GS.

Constituent quark mass in a hot and dense medium

Let us now consider the case of quarks in a hot and dense medium, at early times of FD evolution. At this stage we assume to have two flavors. Then, the relations ([\ref=Eq_23]) - ([\ref=Eq_25]) for two flavors SUf(2) are reduced to

[formula]

The suffix nB,T at chiral condensate denotes the Gibbs average over hadron states and meson states [\cite=Bochkarev] [\cite=HatsudaKoikeLee] [\cite=zschocke1] [\cite=zschocke3] and references therein. Note that for isospin-symmetric matter there is no difference in the density and temperature dependence of u-quark and d-quark condensate, that means [formula]. In the limit of high densities and temperatures the constituent quark mass, Mf, approaches the current quark mass, mf. The well-known model-independent linear density dependence of the chiral condensate has widely been applied in many investigations, e.g. [\cite=Drukarev_Levin] [\cite=LiShakin] [\cite=Cohen_Furnstahl1] [\cite=zschocke1]. The temperature dependence of the chiral condensate has been determined up to order O(T8) in [\cite=Gerber_Leutwyler]. In order to determine the density and temperature dependence of the chiral condensate we follow the arguments of Refs. [\cite=LiShakin] [\cite=zschocke1] [\cite=zschocke2], where the first leading terms in the low-density low-temperature expansion have been obtained:

[formula]

The temperature and density dependence of chiral condensate has been plotted in Ref. [\cite=zschocke2]. The baryonic density in terms of quark degrees of freedom is given by

[formula]

where nf ([formula]) is the quark (anti-quark) density. The baryonic density in a given volume V is related to the conserved baryon number NB by [formula]; note the relation   c  =  197.3  MeV  fm. For the logarithmic scale we take Λq≃300  MeV, for details see [\cite=Gerber_Leutwyler]. The pion mass in vacuum is mπ  =  138  MeV and the pion decay constant in vacuum is fπ  =  93  MeV. The numerical value of the quark-sigma-term is σq  =  15  MeV (see e.g. Ref. [\cite=LiShakin]), which is three times smaller than the nucleon-sigma-term σN  =  45  MeV.

By combining Eq. ([\ref=Eq_50]) with Eq. ([\ref=Eq_60]), we obtain the expression for the in-medium mass of constituent-quarks:

[formula]

The temperature and density dependence of the constituent quark mass is plotted in FIG. [\ref=condensate]. According to Eq. ([\ref=Eq_70]), for sufficiently high temperatures and densities the constituent quark mass will coincide with the current-quark-mass mf. Of course, the applicability of Eq. ([\ref=Eq_70]) is restricted to low densities and temperatures. In any case, the most upper limit for density and temperature is given by the condition that constituent quark mass has to be positive.

Expanding quark-anti-quark bag

The Bag consists of quarks, anti-quarks, and the gluon fields. Non-perturbative effects in the QCD vacuum and the energy density of gluon fields are described by the Bag constant, B. In our model, we subdivide the bag into N individual cells, each of which moves with an individual flow velocity i.

Total energy of the bag

The total energy of the bag in the center-of-mass frame of the colliding nuclei is given by the volume integral of the "00" component of the energy momentum tensor of each cell i, [formula]. Considering that our EoS is given as a sum of the energy and pressure of the ideal quark and anti-quark gas plus the uniform bag energy density B, that means [formula] and [formula], the total energy of all cells of the bag in the center-of-mass frame of the colliding nuclei is given by

[formula]

where the sum runs over the number of all cells of the bag. Here, we assume a uniform bag-field energy density B over the whole volume, V; B depends on density and temperature of the bag, thus on the time of the evolution of the fireball. We have used the notation ei for the invariant scalar, rest-frame energy density, and Pi for the scalar pressure, Vi is the volume of cell i in the center-of-mass frame, and [formula] where [formula] is the 3-velocity of cell i. In order to determine the rest-frame energy or proper energy of the cells, we assume a Boltzmann-Jüttner distribution [\cite=Juttner] for the particles inside each individual cell:

[formula]

and [formula] is the normalization of the Jüttner distribution, where Ni is the number of particles of a given type inside cell i under consideration. The proper energy density is a Lorentz invariant quantity by definition and, therefore, can be evaluated in any frame, e.g. in the local rest frame. Accordingly, we obtain the following expression for the energy density of quarks and anti-quarks for each cell of the bag:

[formula]

Here, the density and temperature dependent constituent quark mass Mf is given in ([\ref=Eq_70]), and niB and Ti are the baryonic density and temperature, respectively, of the cell i. The initial value of the Bag constant is abbreviated by B0, and we use the numerical value [formula]; see also considerations in Ref. [\cite=Szhorvat].

Total entropy of the bag

The total entropy in the center-of-mass Lorentz frame (CM) is given by

[formula]

where the sum runs over all cells of the bag. The invariant scalar entropy density, si, can be evaluated in any frame. The total entropy density consists of entropy density of the quarks and anti-quarks, and for the assumed Jüttner distribution is given by:

[formula]

In what follows, we will take the adiabatic limit, which implies the total entropy to be a constant. We note that there is no Bag constant in the expression for the total entropy because the Bag-field is uniform, i.e. the entropy of Bag-field vanishes.

Total momentum of the bag

The total momentum of the bag in the center-of-mass Lorentz-frame is given by

[formula]

where the sum runs over all cells of the bag. The scalar pressure of each individual cell of the bag is given by

[formula]

We note, that there is no Bag constant in the expression for the total momentum ([\ref=total_momentum]) because it cancels out in the sum ei  +  Pi according to Eqs. ([\ref=Eq_75]) and ([\ref=Eq_96]).

Chemical potential of quarks and anti-quarks

Assuming a Jüttner distribution, the density [formula] of quarks having flavor f and the density of anti-quarks [formula] having flavor f in a given cell i is determined by the following equations:

[formula]

In mechanical (pressure), thermal and chemical equilibrium, the number of quarks depends only on baryonic chemical potential μB and temperature T. Especially, if the quarks and anti-quarks are in chemical equilibrium with each other, then μq  =  μB  /  3 and [formula]. In order to determine the baryonic chemical potential μB we have to use the total baryonic number density nB given in Eq. ([\ref=baryonic_density_1]). Then, according to the expressions ([\ref=chemical_potential_5]) and ([\ref=chemical_potential_10]), we obtain a definition of the chemical potential μiB of cell i as

[formula]

where we have used [formula]. We assume that these thermodynamic relations hold in the ideal QGP until the final stage of the expansion starts. Then the net baryon number in each cell NiB and the number of quarks and anti-quarks, Niq  =  (niu  +  nid)Vi and [formula], respectively, are given. While Vi and thus nif and [formula] are changing during the expansion, the numbers of quarks and anti-quarks, Niq and [formula], are fixed at this point in each cell and do not change afterwards. This is the chemical freeze out in the model.

The volumes, baryonic and quark densities and temperatures of each individual cell change during the expansion. The chemical equilibrium between the baryon density and quark- and anti-quark densities breaks down at this point. Consequently, the chemical potentials for the single quarks are related to the single quark (and anti-quark) densities only and are not connected to the net baryon density. Although we need the chemical potentials for the calculation of the energy density, pressure and entropy, these must be calculated from the given quark and anti-quark densities in each cell, by using Eqs. ([\ref=chemical_potential_5]) and ([\ref=chemical_potential_10]), which determine μiq and [formula]. The net baryon number nB is conserved and is determined by Eq. ([\ref=baryonic_density_1]) using Eqs. ([\ref=chemical_potential_5]) and ([\ref=chemical_potential_10]). Only in case of chemical equilibrium Eq. ([\ref=baryonic_density_2]) is used to determine the chemical potential μB. That is, the NB / Nq and [formula] ratio freezes out first at the initialization of our model calculation for the final expansion stage, where quarks start to gain mass, the background field B starts to disappear, but the constituent quark numbers do not change. The flow does not evolve, the cells expand while coasting with negligible pressure. Still considerable changes happen regarding the masses and temperatures of the system.

Non-equilibrium expansion stage

Rapid hadronization hypothesis

A first order phase transition in chemical and thermal equilibrium with homogeneous nucleation would take a long time[\cite=CK92], longer than two particle correlation measurements indicate. If the homogeneous nucleation cannot support the required rapid transition then the transition becomes delayed and freeze out and hadronization will happen rapidly and simultaneously from a supercooled QGP. Thus, a rapid process must be out of equilibrium, at least of chemical equilibrium [\cite=Csorgo_Csernai]. Possible detailed mechanisms of this out of equilibrium transition are addressed recently in several works [\cite=Csernai_Mishustin] [\cite=Randrup_2010]. In the framework of the present model this transition is represented by the mass gain and coalescence of constituent quarks, and the simultaneous disappearance of the Bag-field. These two processes are treated phenomenologically, while we enforce conservation laws and our model constraints.

Such a rapid, out of equilibrium process must result in additional entropy production [\cite=Csorgo_Csernai] from the latent heat of the transition (just like at sudden condensation of supercooled vapour). We start with our model at the line where we have quarks with current quark masses, and the process ends when we reach the empirical hadron freeze out line, where quarks have constituent quark mass.

It was found by Cleymans et al. [\cite=Cleymans] that, in a wide range of beam energies, detected hadrons freeze out and reach the detectors when the average energy of hadrons (estimated in a thermal, statistical equilibrium fireball model) is between [formula]. Just at the Freeze Out moment the particles do not interact any longer, so the ideal hadron gas mixture is a good approximation. Furthermore, if we plot the FO points on the temperature-chemical potential

[formula]

-range the FO contour lines are shown in Diagram (A) of FIG. [\ref=fig:cleymans-lines]; we have taken into account the lightest 100 hadrons, i.e. [formula].

In this transition the expansion of the quark gas continues until the average energy per hadron reaches about [formula]. In a statistical thermal equilibrium model this can be represented on the

[formula]

plane is plotted in Diagram (B) of FIG. [\ref=fig:cleymans-lines].

The cold uniform nuclear matter has an equilibrium density of [formula] fm- 3, similar to the central density of large nuclei. At higher temperatures a considerable number of mesons are also present in statistical equilibrium, thus the effective baryon density for the same energy density decreases with increasing temperature. This enables us to construct an effective Cleymans-freeze-out line on the

[formula]

-contour where our quarks have current quark mass of about 7  MeV. This contour is plotted in FIG. [\ref=Initial_Condition]. The chemical equilibrium then ceases among quarks and anti-quarks, and we neglect quark and anti-quark annihilations in the final expansion stage. Thus, the total number of quarks and anti-quarks, Nq and [formula], remains constant (in contrast to the statistical thermal equilibrium model), while the baryon charge, [formula], remains also constant as required by baryon conservation.

At the final point of the non-equilibrium expansion quarks will coalesce into mesons, baryons and anti-baryons, based on the phase space arguments used in [\cite=Molnar]. The rate of recombination is given by

[formula]

Here, q ([formula]) denotes quarks (anti-quarks), m denotes mesons, b ([formula]) denotes baryons (anti-baryons), gm and gb are mesonic and baryonic degeneracy factors, and the coefficients Cm and Cb should be determined by including phase space factors and an additional normalization constant to satisfy the following relations. Notice that the same statistical phase-space factors appear in coalescence rates and in the statistical thermal model if the overlap integrals of the coalescing constituents are similar. Eventually other channels via di-quark formation can also be taken into account, and the time integrated solution will provide the final hadron abundances.

On the other hand the baryon charge is the excess number of baryons over anti-baryons, and this leads to the normalization requirements for the final hadrons:

[formula]

Thus, a fraction "a" of the anti-quarks may form anti-baryons:

[formula]

and the rest of quarks form mesons

[formula]

The only coefficient, a, should arise from the coalescence factors above. Initially from Eqs. ([\ref=r2]) - ([\ref=r3]) the ratio of formed baryons and anti-baryons is [formula], where [formula]. Assuming that the initial recombination is dominant the conservation laws then yield

[formula]

The full integration of the rate equations may lead to a change of a, which would modify the ratio of anti-baryons to mesons to a smaller extent. In [\cite=Molnar] the same coalescence model explained the constituent quark number scaling of the flow parameter, v2, from a weak elliptic asymmetry of the coalescing quark distributions.

In this way at any stage of expansion, from an initial volume V0 to a point at time t with a given volume V(t), we can get all the meson and baryon densities and masses, as well as the total energy from energy conservation (neglecting the mechanical work done by the negligible pressure).

From the baryon and meson densities nB and nm and the hadronic energy density, EH, we can calculate the baryon and meson chemical potentials (the meson density may exceed the thermal equilibrium value), μB and μm, and the respective temperatures Tb(t) and Tm(t). Notice that with the broken chemical equilibrium the equality of chemical potentials is broken. In this rapid hadronization process the thermal, pressure and flow equilibrium will also break down. Thus the details how this happens should be described in terms of extensive variables as we will see in the next Section.

Choice of initial conditions

Let us consider now the initial conditions for all these parameters. The applicability of Eq. ([\ref=Eq_70]) is restricted by the condition that the constituent quark mass has to be positive. Accordingly, we will take the initial conditions such that in the initial state the in-medium chiral condensate [formula] vanishes and quarks have a current quark mass. This condition implies, that the density and temperature dependent terms in Eq. ([\ref=Eq_70]) are equal to 1. The corresponding curve in the temperature-density plane is shown in FIG. [\ref=Initial_Condition]. We used for the current quark mass mf  =  7  MeV, ignoring the difference between u and d quarks.

In this model it is assumed that the chemical equilibrium between the quarks and anti-quarks breaks precisely on this curve, and the quark and anti-quark numbers are conserved separately during further expansion. At the earlier stage, the quark and anti-quark numbers, Nq and [formula], are computed from the temperature T and baryon number density nB using Eqs. ([\ref=baryonic_density_2]), ([\ref=chemical_potential_5]) and ([\ref=chemical_potential_10]) with chemical potentials μq  =  μB  /  3 and [formula]. But after crossing the line on FIG. [\ref=Initial_Condition] the numbers of quarks and anti-quarks, Nq and [formula], are assumed to stay constant. During further expansion μq and [formula] change separately and can be obtained numerically from the quark and anti-quark densities, nq and [formula], by means of Eqs. ([\ref=chemical_potential_5]) and ([\ref=chemical_potential_10]). Since this is a non-equilibrium model, all numerical calculations are carried out on the

[formula]

plane).

Expansion of the quark gas

The expansion of the gas of quarks and anti-quarks is considered to be adiabatic, i.e. at constant entropy. The initial total entropy density of the gas, s0, can be calculated from the initial temperature, T0, and initial baryon charge density, n0B, assuming chemical equilibrium between the quarks and anti-quarks, i.e. [formula], and using Eq. [\ref=baryonic_density_2] to get the chemical potential and substituting it into Eqs. ([\ref=entropy_10]), ([\ref=entropy_11]), and ([\ref=entropy_12]).

After the initial moment, the quark and anti-quark densities decrease inversely proportionally to the volume V of the system: nq  =  V0  /  V  n0q, [formula], nB  =  V0  /  V  n0B, where V0 is the initial volume. Then the total entropy of the system can be expressed simply as a function of volume, temperature and numerically obtained chemical potentials (or temperature and baryon density) using Eqs. ([\ref=entropy_10]), ([\ref=entropy_11]) and ([\ref=entropy_12]).

Using the condition that the total entropy is constant, i.e. the entropy density also decreases as [formula], the expansion trajectories on the

[formula]

Recombination into hadrons

Due to confining forces, the quarks will finally recombine into hadrons. We assume that this happens rapidly at the point of recombination when the average energy per hadron (including the background field) decreases to EH / NH  =  1.2  GeV, a value which is still above the values of [formula] obtained by Cleymans et al. [\cite=Cleymans]. This corresponds nearly to the energy per hadron of the empirically observed freeze-out. The endpoints of the expansion curves where the recombination happens are shown in FIG. [\ref=fig:final-points].

The quarks are assumed to recombine into three types of particles: baryons, anti-baryons and mesons, which contain three quarks, three anti-quarks, or a quark and an anti-quark, respectively. All hadrons are assumed to have a mass that is the sum of the masses of their constituent quarks at the freeze-out, i.e.

[formula]

Further differences between the various hadron species are disregarded. Most of the anti-quarks will pair with quarks to form mesons, but a small fraction, a, will form anti-baryons. This ratio, a, can be estimated based on the recombination rates given in [\cite=Molnar]. Thus the baryon, anti-baryon and meson densities nb, [formula] and nm are calculated from the quark and anti-quark densities (nq and [formula]) using Eqs. ([\ref=eq:baryon-number]), ([\ref=eq:meson-number]) and ([\ref=eq:recomb-a-param]).

We assume that at the point of recombination the flow freezes out too, and both the thermal and chemical equilibria cease. The hadrons are assumed to have Jüttner distribution after the freeze out, but the temperature parameter in this distribution will be different for baryons and mesons. The parameters of the distribution after recombination are calculated from the condition of energy conservation: the thermal energy of each hadron type will be equal to the energy of their constituent quarks, Ethm  =  Ethb. Due to the different masses of baryons and mesons, their temperature parameters will be different. The temperature ratio Tb  /  Tm will correspond to the mass ratio Mb  /  Mm  =  3 / 2. The distributions of baryons and mesons for a calculation done with initial state n0B  =  0.21  fm- 3 and T0  =  176  MeV is shown in FIG. [\ref=fig:pt-distribution_A] and FIG. [\ref=fig:pt-distribution_B]. Here the final baryon and meson temperatures are Tb  =  228  MeV and Tm  =  152  MeV and Tb  /  Tm  =  3 / 2, while the final constituent quark mass is 308 MeV. The scaled pt and Et distributions become identical under this condition, however this is not enough to reproduce the NCQ scaling of v2(pt) indicating that the recombination influences the flow velocities of the final hadrons. This concept was already pointed out in [\cite=Molnar] based on the properties of the collision integral. It is important to point out that the transport theoretical treatment and the collision integral are applicable also at situations when the local equilibrium has ceased to exist.

Elliptic flow

The elliptic flow parameter, v2, can be calculated from the final, post Freeze-Out distribution by the Cooper-Frye formula. Assuming an isochronous FO hypersurface, we obtain simple expressions for final measurables [\cite=Elliptic_Flow1].

Formula for the elliptic flow

In this Section we mainly follow the arguments of Refs. [\cite=Elliptic_Flow1] [\cite=Elliptic_Flow2]. The kinematic average of a quantity A(,) is given by

[formula]

where f(,) is the one-particle distribution function. Especially, we are interested in the elliptic flow v2, that is the following kinematic average

[formula]

According to Eqs. ([\ref=Eq_1]) and ([\ref=Eq_5]), we obtain

[formula]

Now we subdivide the system into N fireballs or cells, each of which has a given volume Vi and contains a given number of particles Ni, which are distributed by a given distribution function fi(,) inside cell i. Since in a given cell the elliptic flow parameter v2 does not depend on coordinate [formula], we can take the integral over d3x and obtain

[formula]

where we have used the relation [formula] with [formula] being the transverse momentum. In our study we consider the mid-rapidity particles, (pz  =  0 or the rapidity y  =  0), i.e.   =  (px,py) and there is no integration for the longitudinal momentum or rapidity. Furthermore, we are interested in the momentum dependence of elliptic flow parameter v2. Thus we obtain from ([\ref=Eq_15]) the expression:

[formula]

where the sum runs over all individual cells i = 1,...,N, and we have used the fact that for mid-rapidity particles 2  =  p2x  +  p2y  =  2t. Let us study the elliptic flow of a single type of particle. We assume a Jüttner distribution in each individual cell of the bag, see Eq. ([\ref=Juttner_A]), and obtain

[formula]

where pv is the component of the momentum parallel to the cell velocity [formula], and μi is the chemical potential of the given particle type in the cell i; here we have also used uμi  =  γi(1,vix,viy,0)  ,  uiμ  =  γi(1,  -  vix,  -  viy,0) and pμ  =  (p0,px,py,0)  ,  pμ  =  (p0,  -  px,  -  py,0). Since the elliptic flow parameter is calculated after chemical freeze-out has happened, each particle type has their own chemical potential

[formula]

where ni is the density and Mi is the mass of the given particle type. For particles at CM rapidity the zeroth component of four-momentum equals the transverse mass, i.e. it is just the energy of one particle

[formula]

Then, according to Eqs. ([\ref=Eq_16]) and ([\ref=Juttner]), we obtain the following expression for the elliptic flow:

[formula]

where the sum runs over all cells of the bag. Now let us insert Eq. ([\ref=Juttner]) into expression ([\ref=elliptic_flow_A]). Then, by means of Eq. ([\ref=eq:juttner-density]) we obtain the following expression for the v2 parameter:

[formula]

where Ñi denotes

[formula]

If the direction of the velocity of cell i relative to axis x is denoted by φi0, then pv can be written as pv  =  pt cos (φ  -  φ0), and the following expression is obtained:

[formula]

I0 and I2 denote the zeroth and second order modified Bessel functions of the first kind [\cite=Abramowitz_Stegun].

Notice that if the source temperatures are all equal or if the Freeze Out temperature of all fluid cells is the same, than one observes a linear increase of v2 as a function of [formula] or [formula]. This is frequently quoted as a linear hydrodynamical increase, observed already in the first model calculations, e.g. [\cite=Elliptic_Flow1]. Such linear increase leads trivially to a constituent quark number scaling. It is easy to see that this feature is just a consequence of the equal temperature assumption. If for example we assume a large, hotter, static central source, the high [formula] behaviour of v2 will be dominated by this hot source and thus v2 will decrease at high [formula] as pointed out in ref. [\cite=Elliptic_Flow2].

If we assume that the temperatures of all cells are the same, Ti  =  T, then the temperature- and mass-dependent parts of Ñi (see Eq. ([\ref=eq:n-tilde])) cancel from the numerator and denominator of Eq. ([\ref=eq:v2-full]), and we get (note at FO the constituent quark mass does not depend on density and temperature anymore)

[formula]

In the special case of four cells moving into the four directions (±  x,  ±  y), Eq. ([\ref=eq:v2-simple]) reduces to the expression given in [\cite=Elliptic_Flow1].

The simplest configuration that can approximate elliptic flow is dividing the system into two cells that move in opposite directions with the same velocity v. For this "two-cell" model case the v2 parameter is expressed as

[formula]

A slightly more complicated possibility is having one larger non-moving central cell, and two smaller side cells moving in opposite directions, as shown in FIG. [\ref=fig:three-cells]. In this "three-cell" model case [formula] can be expressed as

[formula]

Here Nc denotes the particle number of the central cell, while Ns denotes the particle number of the identical side-cells. This configuration corresponds to a flow with less pronounced asymmetry. The large central cell has a spherical momentum distribution, while the smaller side cells introduce a slight asymmetry to this.

Calculation of the elliptic flow

Two-cell model

As a first approximation, the v2 parameter was calculated using a simple model of elliptic flow where the system is divided into two droplets moving in opposite directions with the same velocity. For this model, v2 is given by Eq. ([\ref=eq:v2-twocell]). The baryons and mesons were given different flow energies, such that the ratio of flow energy per quark is (FEb  /  ncq)  /  (FEm  /  ncq)  =  3 / 2. This leads to different flow velocities for baryons and mesons, and reproduces the constituent quark number scaling of the elliptic flow parameter. In this model the scaling according to the transverse momentum and transverse energy Et are tied to each other, i.e. the scaling is either present or not for both these variables. By this point of the evolution of our system, all energy in the background field is exhausted and the internal, excitation and random kinetic energies of the hadrons reach the FO value [formula]. The [formula] curve obtained with the initial state parameters discussed in the previous Section is shown in FIG. [\ref=fig:v2-pt].

The elliptic flow parameter, re-scaled according to constituent quark number is shown in FIG. [\ref=fig:v2-cqn]. In this figure, the baryon- and meson-curves coincide for low , i.e. constituent quark number scaling of v2 is reproduced for small values of the transverse momentum, but not for [formula] MeV. These results of QNS can be further improved by considering a three-cell model, as we will see in the next Subsection.

Three-cell model

The asymmetry in the two-cell model described in the previous Subsection is very strong. In [\cite=Molnar] it is shown that the constituent quark number scaling is more precise if the v2 coefficient is small, and the higher harmonic coefficients, vk (k > 2) are negligible. Therefore, a three-cell model with one large stationary central cell and two moving side cells was also studied. The schematic scheme of this arrangement of cells is shown on FIG. [\ref=fig:three-cells].

The elliptic flow parameter of the three-cell model is given by Eq. ([\ref=eq:v2-threecell]) and the result is shown in FIG. [\ref=fig:v2-pt-three]. The side cells were assumed to have the same velocities as in the case of the two-cell model, and the temperature of all cells was the same. The particle number ratio of the central cell to the side cells was set to Nc  /  Ns  =  10. It should be noticed, that the elliptic flow parameter, shown in FIG. [\ref=fig:v2-pt-three], is not insensitive on such choice, e.g. a ratio of Nc  /  Ns  =  5 would enlarge the value of v2.

The elliptic flow parameter, re-scaled according to constituent quark number is shown in FIG. [\ref=fig:v2-3-cqn]. We have found that QNS is insensitive on the chosen particle number ratio Nc  /  Ns  =  10, e.g. a ratio Nc  /  Ns  =  5 yields very similar results as shown in FIG. [\ref=fig:v2-3-cqn] According to the results in FIG. [\ref=fig:v2-3-cqn], the three-cell model is able to reproduce the constituent quark number scaling of v2 for a wider range of  values compared to the two-cell model. It must be noted that this is not only a result of the reduction of the momentum distribution asymmetry compared to the two-cell model. However, the choice of flow velocities for baryons and mesons is still relevant.

Summary

A model of rapid hadronization was considered in which the effective constituent quark mass depends on density and temperature. In this model the evolution starts from an ideal QGP in chemical, thermal and mechanical equilibrium. Then, one after the other the chemical, thermal and mechanical equilibrium break down rapidly, while the quarks build up constituent quark mass, and the background gluon field (bag constant) breaks up and vanishes. This model can be considered as a simple representation of the breaking chiral symmetry and deconfinement in a dynamical transition crossing the Quarkyonic phase [\cite=McLerran_Pisarski].

The elliptic flow parameter v2 was calculated for the final hadron distributions obtained from the model, and the constituent quark number scaling was partially reproduced. We assume the following stages of hadronization: 1) The chemical equilibrium between the quarks and anti-quarks breaks and the chiral symmetry breaks at the same time. 2) The quark and anti-quark numbers are assumed to be conserved during further expansion, i.e. quark, anti-quark pair creations and annihilations are ceased. 3) As the quark gas expands and cools, the quarks gain mass according to Eq. ([\ref=Eq_70]), and the field associated with the Bag constant B decreases. 4) The thermal freeze-out and recombination into hadrons are completed when the mean energy per hadron reaches the FO value of [formula]. The created hadrons are not in local thermal and flow equilibrium with each other. We considered only three types of hadrons: baryons, anti-baryons and mesons, ignoring the differences between different hadron species, and the momentum distribution of hadrons was calculated.

Using the obtained momentum distributions, the elliptic flow parameter v2 was computed from a simple multi-source model of the elliptic flow. Two cases were considered. In the first case, the flow asymmetry is approximated by two fireballs moving in opposite directions. Although this leads to a very strong asymmetry in the momentum distribution, it leads to a [formula] curve that scales with the constituent quark number for small  values only. In the second case, we added a large central fireball to reduce the asymmetry and approximate pure elliptic flow better (i.e. reduce the higher vk (k > 2) harmonic coefficients). This three-source model was able to reproduce the constituent quark number scaling for a wide range of  values.

The present model is highly simplified and attempts to provide an insight to the rapid hadronization and freeze out process in view of the quark number scaling. We considered the features arising from breaking down of equilibrium in this process in terms of thermo and fluid dynamical parameters which are applicable to partial components of the matter. We intend to implement these concepts in more complex models (like hybrid models) and to search for more fundamental reasons for the observed freeze out features in terms of the partial extensives.

Despite the simplicity of the model, it is capable of reproducing the constituent quark number scaling of the v2 elliptic flow parameter. The presence of constituent quark number scaling in experimental data suggests that the elliptic flow develops in the Quark-Gluon Plasma phase, before the quarks recombine into hadrons. Therefore understanding the origin the elliptic flow can provide insight into the quark phase of matter.
