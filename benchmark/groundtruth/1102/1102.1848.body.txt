On polarized K3 surfaces of genus 33

Introduction

Let S be a [formula] surface, i.e., smooth projective simply connected surface with trivial first Chern class. One may look at such surfaces as two-dimensional counterparts of elliptic curves. In fact, [formula] surfaces turn out to be favourably endowed with geometric, arithmetic, group-theoretic, etc. properties (see [\cite=saint], [\cite=bog-tschinkel], [\cite=nik-1], [\cite=nik-2], [\cite=dolgachev-kondo]).

In the present paper, we study birational geometry of the moduli space of primitively polarized [formula] surfaces over [formula]. Namely, we consider the pairs (S,L), where S is a [formula] surface over [formula] and L is an ample divisor on S (L is called the polarization of S) such that L corresponds to a primitive vector in the Picard lattice [formula]. When one fixes the integer g: = (L2) / 2  +  1 (g is called the genus of (S,L)), the pairs (S,L), when considered up to an isomorphism preserving L, are parameterized by the moduli space Kg.

Recall that Kg is a quasi-projective algebraic variety (see [\cite=bayle-borel], [\cite=viehweg]). In particular, one may study such basic questions of birational geometry as rationality of Kg, its unirationality, rational connectedness, Kodaira dimension of Kg, etc.

S. Mukai's vector bundle method, developed to classify higher dimensional Fano manifolds of Picard number 1 and coindex 3 (see [\cite=mukai-1], [\cite=mukai-2]), allowed to prove unirationality of Kg for [formula] (see [\cite=mukai-3], [\cite=mukai-4], [\cite=mukai-5], [\cite=mukai-6], [\cite=mukai]). At the same time, Kg turned out to be non-unirational for general [formula] (see [\cite=gritsenko-hulek-sancaran], [\cite=kondo-1], [\cite=kondo-2]). In the present paper, we apply the methods (mainly) from [\cite=mukai-1] and [\cite=mukai] to prove the following:

The moduli space K33 is unirational.

Let us outline the proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem:main]. It follows from [\cite=karz-3] (cf. Proposition [\ref=theorem:r-polarized] below) that there exists a [formula] surface S such that [formula] is generated by some very ample divisor H and a ( - 2)-curve C, satisfying (H2)  =  70 and H  ·  C  =  2. In particular, (S,H) is a primitively polarized [formula] surface of genus 36. Furthermore, the divisors H  -  kC, [formula], also provide primitive polarizations on S (see Lemma [\ref=theorem:polarizations] and Remark [\ref=remark:direct-proof]). Moreover, the surfaces (S,H  -  kC) are BN general (see Definition [\ref=definition:bn-general], Lemma [\ref=theorem:bn-general] and Remark [\ref=remark:direct-proof-1]). In particular, due to S. Mukai there exists a rigid vector bundle E3 over S of rank 3, such that the first Chern class c1(E3) equals H  -  4C and dim H0(S,E3)  =  7 (see Theorem-definition [\ref=theorem:existence-if-rigid-v-b]). This E3 is unique and determines a morphism [formula] into the Grassmannian [formula] (see Theorem-definition [\ref=theorem:existence-if-rigid-v-b] and Remark [\ref=remark:when-e-gives-a-morphism]). Moreover, [formula] coincides with the embedding [formula] given by the linear system |H  -  4C|, and the surface [formula] can be described by explicit equations on G(3,7) (see Theorem [\ref=theorem:mukai]). Note that one can run these arguments for any (BN) general polarized [formula] surface (S22,L22) of genus 12, which implies that the moduli space K12 is unirational (see Remark [\ref=remark:s-12-is-unirational]).

Further, vector bundle [formula] turns out to be rigid of rank 3, such that [formula] and [formula] (see Lemma [\ref=theorem:wedge-e-3]). Then again we get a morphism [formula] which coincides with the embedding [formula] given by the linear system |H  -  C|. Working a bit more with the space [formula] (see Proposition [\ref=theorem:key-lemma] and Corollary [\ref=theorem:key-cor]), we find a hyperplane Π and a linear subspace Λ in [formula] (see 3.8 in Section [\ref=section:eq-1] for the construction of Π and Λ) such that the following holds (cf. Lemma [\ref=theorem:key-lemma-2]):

The surface [formula] coincides with the Zariski closure of the locus [formula] in

[formula]

for some global sections [formula] and [formula] of the universal bundle E14 over G(3,14).

Furthermore, any general polarized [formula] surface (S64,L64) of genus 33 can be embedded into G(3,14) in the same way as S above and represented in G(3,14) in the form similar to that in Theorem [\ref=theorem:main-1], with the same Π and Λ (see Lemma [\ref=theorem:k-3-locus]). The latter allows one to construct a rational dominant map [formula] (see 4.5 in Section [\ref=section:eq-2]) to prove Theorem [\ref=theorem:main].

Preliminaries

In the present section, we recall several known notions and facts about (primitively) polarized [formula] surfaces, which will be used in the rest of the paper. We also prove some auxiliary results.

A polarized [formula] surface [formula] of genus g is called BN general if [formula] for all non-trivial [formula] such that L  =  L1  +  L2.

General [formula] surface from the moduli space Kg is BN general. All BN general [formula] surfaces of genus g form a Zariski open subset in Kg.

Let W be a smooth projective variety and E a vector bundle over W. Then E is said to be generated by global sections if the natural homomorphism of OW-modules [formula] is surjective (we identify E with its sheaf of sections).

In the notation of Definition [\ref=definition:generated-by-global-sections], if E is generated by global sections, then one gets a natural morphism [formula]. Here [formula], N: = h0(W,E), and G(r,N) is the Grassmannian of r-dimensional linear subspaces in [formula]. Morphism [formula] sends each x∈W to the subspace [formula] ([formula] is the dual to the fiber Ex  ⊂  E). In particular, we have the equality [formula] for the universal vector bundle E over G(r,N), so that H0(W,E)  =  H0(G(r,N),E). Furthermore, if the natural homomorphism [formula], induced by the r-th exterior power of [formula], is surjective, then [formula] coincides with the embedding [formula] given by the linear system [formula]. More precisely, the diagram

[formula]

commutes (G(r,N) is considered with respect to its Plücker embedding into [formula]).

In Theorem-definition [\ref=theorem:existence-if-rigid-v-b], one can replace () by the condition [formula].

Consider the Fano threefold X with canonical Gorenstein singularities and anticanonical degree ( - KX)3  =  70 (see [\cite=isk-prok], [\cite=karz-1], [\cite=karz-2]). Recall that the divisor - KX is very ample on X and the linear system | - KX| gives an embedding of X into [formula]. We also have

[formula]

where Ê is the quadratic cone on [formula] (see [\cite=karz-3]). The following result was proven in [\cite=karz-3]:

Generic element S∈| - KX| is a [formula] surface such that the lattice [formula] is generated by very ample divisor [formula] and ( - 2)-curve [formula]. Furthermore, we have (H2)  =  70 and H  ·  C  =  2.

Let S be the [formula] surface from Proposition [\ref=theorem:r-polarized].

The divisor H  -  4C is ample on S.

Let Z  ⊂  S be an irreducible curve such that [formula]. Then we have Z  ≠  C. Write

[formula]

in [formula] for some [formula]. Note that a  >  0 because the linear system |m(H  +  C)| is basepoint-free for m  ≫  1 (it provides a contraction of the ( - 2)-curve C) and (H  +  C)  ·  Z  =  72a. On the other hand, we have

[formula]

which implies that b  <   - 6a. But then we get

[formula]

a contradiction. Thus, we have (H  -  4C)  ·  Z  >  0 for every curve Z  ⊂  S, and hence H  -  4C is ample by the Nakai-Moishezon criterion (note that (H  -  4C)2  =  22).

Using the same arguments as in the proof of Lemma [\ref=theorem:polarizations], one can show that H  -  kC is an ample divisor on S, 1  ≤  k  ≤  3, which provides a polarization on S of genus 36  -  2k  -  k2. This can also be seen via a geometric argument. Namely, let [formula] be the linear projection from the plane Π passing through the conic C. The blow up f1:Y1  →  X of C resolves the indeterminacies of p1 on X and gives a morphism g1:Y1  →  X1: = p1(X). It can be easily seen that Y1 is a weak Fano threefold and [formula] is an anticanonically embedded Fano threefold of genus 33 (cf. the proof of Proposition 6.15 in [\cite=karz-2]). Moreover, we get [formula], where [formula] is the f1-exceptional divisor, and the morphism g1 contracts the surface f- 11 *(Ê) to a point. In particular, the locus [formula] consists of a unique point, [formula] and [formula], where E(1): = g1 *(Ef1). One can prove that E(1) is the cone over a rational normal curve of degree 4 such that [formula]. In particular, there exists a rational normal curve [formula] of degree 4, with [formula] for some linear space [formula]. Proceeding with X1, Π1, etc. in the same way as with X, Π, etc. above, we obtain three more anticanonically embedded Fano threefolds [formula], [formula], [formula] of genera 28,21,12, respectively, such that [formula] consists of a unique point, [formula] and [formula] for all k, where E(k) is the cone over a rational normal curve of degree 2  +  2k. By construction, S is isomorphic to a surface Sk∈| - KXk|, [formula]. Furthermore, identifying S with Sk, we obtain that [formula] is an ample divisor on S, which provides a polarization on S of genus 36  -  2k  -  k2, [formula].

The polarized [formula] surface (S,H  -  4C) (of genus 12) is BN general.

Suppose that

[formula]

for some non-trivial [formula]. We may assume that both h0(S,L1),h0(S,L2)  >  0. Write

[formula]

in [formula] for some [formula]. Note that [formula] (cf. the proof of Lemma [\ref=theorem:polarizations]), hence we get a1  =  1, a2  =  0, say. The latter implies that b2  ≠  0. Now, if b2  <  0, then h0(S,L2)  =  0 and we are done. Finally, if b2  >  0, then [formula] and hence

[formula]

since h0(S,L2)  =  h0(S,b2C)  =  1.

Using the same arguments as in the proof of Lemma [\ref=theorem:bn-general], one can show that the polarized [formula] surface (S,H - kC), [formula] (cf. Remark [\ref=remark:direct-proof]), is also BN general.

Lemmas [\ref=theorem:polarizations], [\ref=theorem:bn-general] and Theorem-definition [\ref=theorem:existence-if-rigid-v-b] imply that there exists a rigid vector bundle E3 over S of rank 3, such that c1(E3)  =  H  -  4C and h0(S,E3)  =  7. Then from Remark [\ref=remark:when-e-gives-a-morphism] we get the morphism [formula] which coincides with the embedding [formula]. We also have [formula] for the universal vector bundle E7 over G(3,7).

Let us recall the explicit description of the image [formula]:

The surface S  =  ΦE3(S) coincides with the locus

[formula]

for some global sections

[formula]

and

[formula]

One can repeat literarilly the previous arguments in the case of any BN general polarized [formula] surface (S22,L22) of genus 12. Namely, S22 can be embedded into [formula], where it coincides with the locus [formula] for some [formula], [formula] (so that [formula]). Conversely, any such locus (for generic α and τi) defines a BN general polarized [formula] surface of genus 12 (cf. Example [\ref=example:ex-of-bn-gen]). Moreover, one can prove that (S22,L22) is uniquely determined by the [formula]-orbits of α and τi. From this one constructs a birational map between K12 and a [formula]-bundle over the orbit space [formula]. Then it is easy to see that K12 is unirational.

Recall that there exists an isomorphism δ:G(3,7)  →  G(4,7) induced by the canonical bijection between the projective spaces [formula] and [formula] (see [\cite=bourbaki]). Then the composition [formula] coincides with the embedding [formula]. Let E*7 be the universal vector bundle over G(4,7). Then we have [formula] by identifying S with Ψ(S). The latter implies that [formula] for the rigid vector bundle E4 over S of rank 4, such that c1(E4)  =  H  -  4C and h0(S,E4)  =  7 (see Theorem-definition [\ref=theorem:existence-if-rigid-v-b]). Indeed, the inclusion [formula] coincides with the morphism [formula] (see the construction in Remark [\ref=remark:when-e-gives-a-morphism]), which gives [formula]. Furthermore, it follows from Theorem [\ref=theorem:mukai] that the surface [formula] coincides with the locus

[formula]

for some [formula], [formula], where Q*7 is the dual of the universal quotient vector bundle over G(4,7). The same holds for any BN general polarized [formula] surface (S22,L22) of genus 12 (cf. Remark [\ref=remark:s-12-is-unirational]).

Let us now establish several properties of the vector bundle E3 over the [formula] surface S above.

E3 is (H  -  C)-stable.

Firstly, since E3 is stable, it is (H  -  4C)-semistable (see [\cite=friedman]).

E3 is (H  -  4C)-stable.

Indeed, otherwise there exists a coherent subsheaf F  ⊆  E3 such that [formula] and

[formula]

which is impossible.

Further, if E3 is not (H  -  C)-stable, then Lemma [\ref=theorem:rigid-3-is-h-4c-stable] implies that there exists a cycle Z  =  aH  +  bC, [formula], such that

[formula]

and

[formula]

for the Bogomolov number

[formula]

(see [\cite=friedman]). We have:

[formula]

hence c2(E3)  =  10 by the Riemann-Roch formula on S, and B(E3)  =  16. Then [\eqref=last-inequality] implies that

[formula]

for B: = a  -  b. At the same time, [\eqref=first-2-inequalities] gives

[formula]

and hence a,B  >  0. Then from [\eqref=last-inequality-1] and [\eqref=first-2-inequalities-1] we get

[formula]

or, equivalently,

[formula]

i.e., a  =  1. Then [\eqref=first-2-inequalities-1] implies that [formula]. But for such values of a,B we get

[formula]

(see [\eqref=last-inequality-1]), a contradiction.

Proposition [\ref=theorem:rigid-3-is-h-c-stable] is completely proved.

[formula] for some [formula].

Indeed, if a  <  0 say, then [formula] on C for all s1,s2,s3∈H0(S,E3), which is impossible by construction of the embedding [formula] (cf. Remark [\ref=remark:when-e-gives-a-morphism]).

For any two (distinct) generic global sections s1,s2∈H0(S,E3), the zero locus of the global section [formula] is of codimension [formula] on S.

Lemma [\ref=theorem:non-zero-a-b-c] implies that we may assume the zero locus of [formula] to be of codimension [formula]. Suppose that [formula] on a curve Z  ⊂  S. Note that [formula] on C by Lemma [\ref=theorem:non-zero-a-b-c] and the results in [\cite=mukai-4]. Hence we get Z  ·  C  =  0 and Z  ~  n(H  +  C) for some [formula]. On the other hand, the condition [formula] on Z implies that [formula] for any s'∈H0(S,E3), i.e., we have [formula], which is impossible.

Running the same arguments as in the proof of Proposition [\ref=theorem:rigid-3-is-h-c-stable] and Lemmas [\ref=theorem:rigid-3-is-h-4c-stable], [\ref=theorem:non-zero-a-b-c] and [\ref=theorem:non-zero-sections], one can obtain similar results for the rigid vector bundle E4 over S (see Remark [\ref=remark:dual-construction]). Namely, one can show that E4 is H-stable and for any three (distinct) generic global sections s1,s2,s3∈H0(S,E4) the zero locus of the global section [formula] is of codimension [formula] on S.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem:main-1]

Fix S and E3 constructed in Section [\ref=section:preliminaries].

[formula] is a rigid vector bundle of rank 3, such that

[formula];

[formula].

Firstly, the equality c1(E3)  =  H  -  4C implies that

[formula]

for the rank 3 vector bundle E3. Further, consider the exact sequence

[formula]

Then from χ(S,E3)  =  7 and the Riemann-Roch formula on C we deduce that

[formula]

since deg (E3( - 2))  =  (H  -  C)  ·  C  =  4 for the rank 3 vector bundle [formula] over [formula].

Finally, since E3 is (H  -  C)-stable (see Proposition [\ref=theorem:rigid-3-is-h-c-stable]), [formula] is also (H  -  C)-stable, and hence [formula] is stable (see [\cite=friedman]). Then, since (S,H  -  C) is BN general of genus 33 (see Remark [\ref=remark:direct-proof-1]), Theorem-definition [\ref=theorem:existence-if-rigid-v-b] and Remark [\ref=remark:replace-h-0-with-chi] complete the proof.

Put [formula]. Lemma [\ref=theorem:wedge-e-3] and Theorem-definition [\ref=theorem:existence-if-rigid-v-b] imply that the morphism [formula] coincides with the embedding [formula]. In what follows, we identify S with its image

[formula]

and [formula] with [formula], where E14 is the universal vector bundle over G(3,14). Let us find the defining equations of S on G(3,14).

Fix a basis [formula] in H0(S,E3) for some generic global sections si. Let also t∈H0(S,OS(C)) be the unique global section. Then [formula] is a basis in H0(S,) for some global sections ξi of [formula] (see Lemma [\ref=theorem:wedge-e-3]). We also assume ξi to be generic.

For every i, there exists [formula] such that

[formula]

Consider an affine cover {Uα} of S such that [formula] is trivial and [formula] for every α. Put also [formula] for all j and α. By Lemma [\ref=theorem:non-zero-sections], we can complete {s1,α,s2,α} to a basis on [formula] for each α. Here Γ is a codimension [formula] subset in S. Then the construction of embeddings ΦE3 and [formula] implies that

[formula]

for all i,α and some s'α∈H0(S,E3). Here all fj,α,fα∈O(Uα) and depend on i (note also that s'α a priori depends on both i and α). In particular, we have

[formula]

so that the collection [formula] defines a global holomorphic section of OS(H  -  C) over [formula], hence over S.

[formula] for all α and some [formula] (not depending on α).

We have [formula]. This implies that

[formula]

for some meromorphic function [formula] (depending on ξi). Note that we can take gi to have no poles along C (by generality of ξi,si). Thus, we obtain that [formula], with [formula].

Lemma [\ref=theorem:key-lemma-1] proves Proposition [\ref=theorem:key-lemma].

From Lemma [\ref=theorem:wedge-e-3], arguing as in the proof of Proposition [\ref=theorem:key-lemma], we get the following:

For every i, there exist [formula] such that

[formula]

Take λ,σ1,σ2,σ3 as in Theorem [\ref=theorem:mukai] and write

[formula]

for some [formula]. We may assume that

[formula]

and

[formula]

by identifying λ and σr with

[formula]

respectively. Let also Λ be the linear subspace in [formula] given by the equations from Proposition [\ref=theorem:key-lemma] and Corollary [\ref=theorem:key-cor] for various [formula]. Then we get

[formula]

by construction.

The surface S coincides with the Zariski closure of the locus [formula] in Ŝ.

Indeed, if [formula], then the construction of Λ implies that the components of vectors ξi(x), [formula], are uniquely determined by the components of vectors tsi(x), [formula]. This together with the conditions λ(x)  =  σ1(x)  =  σ2(x)  =  σ3(x)  =  0 shows that S0 is an irreducible surface (cf. Theorem [\ref=theorem:mukai]) such that S0  ⊆  S, hence the result.

Lemma [\ref=theorem:key-lemma-2] proves Theorem [\ref=theorem:main-1].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem:main]

We use the same notation as in Sections [\ref=section:preliminaries] and [\ref=section:eq-1].

Consider the locus

[formula]

for some

[formula]

and

[formula]

such that

[formula]

[formula]. Let us assume further that

[formula]

for all i,j,j1,j2,j3. Let S64 be the Zariski closure of the locus [formula] in Ŝ64.

S64 is a primitively polarized [formula] surface of genus 33 with respect to [formula].

The same arguments as in the proof of Lemma [\ref=theorem:key-lemma-2] show that [formula] is an irreducible surface (cf. [\eqref=general-s-33]). Moreover, S64 is an irreducible component of Ŝ64, for all other components having dimension > 2 and contained in [formula] (cf. the construction of Λ). In particular, we obtain that S64 is a generic surface in a flat family containing S, hence the result.

Consider vector bundle [formula] over S64.

[formula] is a rigid vector bundle of rank 3, such that

L̂64: = c1()  =  OS64(1) is a primitive polarization, (L̂264) = 64;

χ(S,)  =  14.

In particular, [formula] is unique and the embedding [formula] coincides with the morphism [formula].

This follows from Lemma [\ref=theorem:wedge-e-3], openness of the stability condition (see [\cite=maruyama]), and Theorem-definition [\ref=theorem:existence-if-rigid-v-b].

Take two generic [formula] surfaces S1, S2 obtained from the loci of the form [\eqref=general-s-33], with the same Λ, as S64 above (cf. Lemma [\ref=theorem:k-3-locus]). Then again the line bundle [formula] provides a primitive polarization on Si. Lemma [\ref=theorem:restriction-is-stable] implies that (S1,OS1(1))≃(S2,OS2(1)) iff there exists [formula] such that S1  =  τ(S2) (exactly as in the proof of Theorem 4.6 in [\cite=mukai-4]). In particular, (S64,OS64(1)) is uniquely determined up to an isomorphism by the [formula]-orbits of λ̂ and [formula], [formula]. This gives a rational dominant map [formula] which sends each (generic) [formula] surface [formula] to the corresponding S64. Now Remark [\ref=remark:s-12-is-unirational] completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem:main].

One can apply the same arguments as in the proof of Lemma [\ref=theorem:wedge-e-3] to the vector bundle E4 over S (cf. Remarks [\ref=remark:dual-construction] and [\ref=remark:dual-construction-1]) to show that [formula] is a rigid vector bundle of rank 4, such that [formula] and [formula]. Furthermore, applying the same arguments as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem:main-1], one can show that

[formula]

with [formula] for [formula]. Moreover, using similar arguments as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem:main-1] and Remark [\ref=remark:dual-construction], one can prove that [formula] coincides with the Zariski closure of the locus [formula] in

[formula]

for some [formula], [formula], where Π and Λ* are fixed hyperplane and linear subspace in [formula], respectively, E13 is the universal vector bundle over G(4,13), and Q*13 is the dual of the universal quotient vector bundle over G(4,13). Finally, applying the same arguments as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem:main], one can show that the same holds for any BN general polarized [formula] surface (S36,L36) of genus 36, which again gives a rational dominant map [formula].
