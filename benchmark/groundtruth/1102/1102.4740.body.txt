Totality of Subquantum Nonlocal Correlations

Introduction

Tremendous development of quantum technologies provides new intriguing possibilities for tests of foundations of QM and even generates expectations to test predictions of prequantum models, i.e., models describing microphenomena at the subquantum level and reproducing QM as emerging theory. In a series of previous papers [\cite=KHR] I developed a purely field model of microphenomena, so called prequantum classical statistical field theory (PCSFT). By this theory quantum systems are represented by classical Gaussian random fields. Correlations of quantum observables A1 and A2 on a composite system S = (S1,S2) are represented as correlations of quadratic forms, fA1(φ1),fA2(φ2), of components of the prequantum random field ω  →  φ(ω) = (φ1(ω),φ2(ω)) representing S at the subquantum level. (Here ω is a random parameter.) PCSFT not only reproduces important probabilistic predictions of QM including correlations for entangled systems, but it gives a possibility to go beyond QM, i.e., to make predictions on phenomena which could be observed at the subquantum level. In particular, our prequantum model predicts not only correlations of functionals (quadratic forms) of the prequantum field, φ  →  f(φ), corresponding to quantum observables, but even correlations between components of the prequantum field corresponding to the subsystems S1 and S2 of S. These correlations are always nonzero, even for random fields corresponding to quantum systems in factorizable states, [formula] We investigate this property of the prequantum field in very detail and found that the situation is very tricky from the probabilistic viewpoint. Although components of the prequantum field are always correlated, all functionals of this field corresponding to quantum observables for S1 and S2 are never correlated (in the case of factorizable states). Thus this effect, nonzero correlation between prequantum random fields representing e.g. proton and electron which had been prepared independently e.g. at Växjö and Moscow, cannot be found by using "ordinary quantum observables". New more delicate measurement procedures have to be designed. In aforementioned example we took proton and electron to emphasize that correlations on the subquantum level have no direct relation to the quantum entanglement for indistinguishable quantum systems, e.g., a pair of electrons. Moreover, PCSFT predicts correlations even between prequantum random fields corresponding to bosons and fermions (even in the case of factorizable states). What is a source of subquantum correlations? Why are prequantum random fields corresponding to all quantum particles correlated?

PCSFT is heavily based on the assumption of the presence of a sufficiently strong background field, cf. with stochastic electrodynamics. It is impossible to introduce a positively defined covariance operator and hence to construct a classical random field representation for quantum systems without such a field. We can speculate that the common background field is responsible for totality of correlations at the subquantum level. The situation is very special from the probabilistic viewpoint. For some quantum states, entangled states of QM, it is in principle impossible to separate the background field from so to say the intrinsic field of e.g. an electron. The latter field does not exist as a classical random field (this is again the problem of positive definiteness of the covariance operator). For entangled states, the contribution of the background field can be separated from the "intrinsic contribution" only on the level of averages: the quantum average is obtained as the difference between the average with respect the "total prequantum signal" and the average with respect to the background signal (a kind of calibration procedure), see ([\ref=YY1]), ([\ref=YY2]).

In this situation of totality of mutual correlations it is natural to consider a prequantum grand field. Random fields corresponding to quantum systems are simply random signals generated by such a grand field. Hence, this work can be considered as a step towards classical unified field theory. However, this is a very preliminary step.

We start with a brief review of our previous results about classical representation of quantum correlations, see [\cite=KHR] for details. Then we modify the previously developed formalism to obtain a symmetric coupling between quantum and classical covariances. Then we show that quadratic forms of Gaussian signals corresponding to quantum systems in factorizable states are not correlated. Finally, we present a criterium to distinguish prequantum random fields corresponding to entangled quantum systems from fields corresponding to disentangled ones.

To simplify considerations, we will study quantum systems with finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Moreover, we consider a toy-model with the real Hilbert state space.

Classical representation of quantum correlations

Take a Hilbert space H as the space of states of classical random fields. In classical signal theory [formula] To escape from mathematical problems we work in the finite-dimensional case. However, in the appendix we work (on the physical level of rigorousness) with [formula]

Consider a probability distribution P on H having zero average (it means that [formula] for any y∈M) and the covariance operator D:

[formula]

The P can be considered as the probability distribution of an H-valued random variable - random field (signal) (the terminology which matches better the case [formula] We remark that a covariance operator does not determine the random signal uniquely. However, in the Gaussian case each D determines uniquely the Gaussian measure with zero mean value.

Let [formula] and φ(ω) = (φ1(ω),...,φn(ω)), then zero average condition is reduced to [formula] where E is the operation of classical mathematical expectation; the covariance matrix D = (dkl), where [formula] We also recall that the dispersion of the random variable φ is given by

[formula]

In the case of zero average we simply have

[formula]

Operator representation of wave function of composite system

In this section we show that the wave function of a composite system has an operator representation which is useful in coupling quantum and classical correlations at the subquantum level, see [\cite=KHR].

Let H be a real Hilbert space. We denote the space of self-adjoint operators acting in H by the symbol Ls(H). Since in this paper we consider only the finite dimensional real case, this space can be realized as the space of all symmetric matrices.

Let H1 and H2 be two real (finite dimensional) Hilbert spaces. We put [formula] Any vector Ψ∈H can be represented in the form [formula] and it determines a linear operator from H2 to H1

[formula]

Of course, Ψ̂Ψ̂*:H1  →  H1 and Ψ̂*Ψ̂:H2  →  H2 and these operators are self-adjoint and positively defined. Consider operator [formula] and the operators [formula] and [formula] If the vector Ψ is normalized by 1, then ρ is the density operator corresponding to the pure state Ψ and the operators [formula] are the reduced density operators. These density operators describe quantum states of subsystems Si,i = 1,2, of a composite quantum system S = (S1,S2). For any [formula] the following equalities hold:

[formula]

For any pair of operators Âj∈Ls(Hj),j = 1,2, the following equality holds [\cite=KHR]:

[formula]

It will play a fundamental role in representation of quantum correlations as classical correlations of quadratic forms of the prequantum random field.

Let the state vectors of systems S1 and S2 belong to Hilbert spaces H1 and H2, respectively. Then by QM the state vector Ψ of the composite system S = (S1,S2) belongs to [formula] We remark that the interpretation of the state vector Ψ∈H of a composite system is not as straightforward as for a single system. It is known that, in general, a pure state Ψ of a composite system does not determine pure states for its components. This viewpoint matches well our approach. We shall interpret a normalized vector Ψ∈H not as the state vector of a concrete composite system S = (S1,S2), but as one of blocks of the covariance operator for the prequantum random field ω  →  φ(ω) = (φ1(ω),φ2(ω)) describing S = (S1,S2).

From classical to quantum correlations

Let φ1 and φ2 be two random vectors, in Hilbert spaces H1 and H2, respectively. Consider Cartesian product of these Hilbert spaces: [formula](don't mix with [formula] and the random vector [formula] such that: a) its expectation Eφ  =  0; b) its dispersion σ2(φ)  =  E||φ||2  <    ∞  . Take its covariance operator D which is determined by the symmetric (positive) bilinear form: (Du,v)  =  E(u,φ)(v,φ), where vectors [formula] This operator has the block structure [formula] where Dii:Hi  →  Hi,Dij:Hj  →  Hi.

Let Âi∈Ls(Hi),i = 1,2. It determines the quadratic function on the Hilbert space Hi:fAi(φi)  =  (Âiφi,φi). Such quadratic functionals are prequantum physical variables corresponding to quantum observables.

For any Gaussian random vector φ  =  (φ1,φ2) having zero average and any pair of operators Âi∈Ls(Hi),i = 1,2, the following equality takes place [\cite=KHR]

[formula]

[formula]

We also remark that [\cite=KHR] TrDiiÂi  =  EfAi(φi),i = 1,2. Thus EfA1fA2  =  EfA1EfA2  +  2TrD12Â2D21Â1. Now take an arbitrary pure state of a composite system S = (S1,S2), a normalized vector Ψ∈H. Consider a Gaussian vector random field such that D12  =  Ψ̂. By operator equality ([\ref=Zuzu]) the last summand in the right-hand side of ([\ref=T00]) is equal to the QM-average. Hence, we obtain [formula] or, for the covariance of two classical random vectors fA1,fA2, we have:

[formula]

This formula was derived in [\cite=KHR]. One of problems is its asymmetry: classical covariance on one side, i.e., centered correlation, but non-centered quantum correlation on another side. We shall obtain symmetric representation. However, first we have to discuss a more fundamental problem

Operators Dii are responsible for averages of random variables ω  →  f(φi(ω)), i.e., depending only on one of components of the vector random field φ. In particular, EfAi(φi)  =  TrDiiÂi.

We shall construct such a random field that these averages will match those given by QM. It is natural to take the covariance operator [formula] However, in general this operator is not positively defined and, hence, it cannot serve as a covariance operator. In [\cite=KHR] it was proposed to modify aforementioned operator and consider [formula] where ε > 0 is sufficiently large. We remark that white noise is a Gaussian random variable with zero average and the unit covariance operator I. Thus additional terms in diagonal blocks are related to the white noise background. The situation is tricky: in general it is impossible (in the classical mathematical model) to separate this noisy background from a random prequantum field. We cannot consider a random field with the covariance operator DΨ as the sum of two signals, e.g., an electron signal and the background signal. For some states (entangled states), the matrix with ε = 0 is not positively defined. We discuss this point in more detail:

Suppose now that φ(ω) is a random vector with the covariance operator DΨ. Then

[formula]

[formula]

These relations for averages and relation ([\ref=Q1]) for the correlation provide coupling between theory of classical Gaussian signals (in the finite-dimensional case simply theory of Gaussian random variables) and QM. Quantum statistical quantities can be obtained from corresponding quantities for classical random field. One may say that "irreducible quantum randomness" is reduced to randomness of classical prequantum fields. However, the situation is more complicated. The equalities ([\ref=YY1]), ([\ref=YY2]) imply that quantum averages are obtained as the shift-type renormalizations of averages with respect to classical random fields. The shift corresponds to subtraction of the contribution of the background field. Thus quantum averages are not simply classical averages. They are obtained as the result of renormalization with respect of the background field.

Modification of correspondence between quantum observables and classical variables

Although equality ([\ref=Q1]) establishes the coupling between classical correlations of random signals and quantum correlations, it is not completely satisfactory from the purely probabilistic viewpoint. On the left-hand side of ([\ref=Q1]) we have the classical covariation,   (fA1,fA2), but on the right-hand side we have just the quantum average of the correlation observable [formula] We want to modify the correspondence between quantum and classical models to obtain a symmetric relation between classical and quantum covariances. We recall that the latter is given by [formula]

[formula]

We set

[formula]

Then 〈Â0i〉  =  0 and

[formula]

Let us modify the correspondence between classical and quantum variables, see section [\ref=EER]. Instead of the formerly used correspondence

[formula]

we introduce a new map from the quantum model to the classical prequantum model

[formula]

By using ([\ref=Q1]) for Â0i instead of Âi, we obtain

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

We remark that in ([\ref=Q1]) the factor 2 in front of the quantum correlation disappears in the complex case [\cite=KHRJMP]. So, in the complex case the correspondence becomes really symmetric. (We proceed in the real Hilbert space, since in the complex case the basis operator equality ([\ref=Zuzu]) is more complicated and its presentation is based on more complicated operator theory.)

Independence of components of prequantum random fields corresponding to factorizable quantum states

Consider now a factorizable quantum state [formula] where Ψi∈Hi,i  =  1,2. Then

[formula]

Hence,

[formula]

Thus by ([\ref=t4]),

[formula]

Factorization of a pure quantum state Ψ implies that, for any two quantum observables Âi on the subsystems Si,i  =  1,2, of a composite system S  =  (S1,S2), the corresponding prequantum variables, fA0i(φi), where Â0i  =  Âi  -  〈Ai〉I, are uncorrelated.

Totality of correlations at the subquantum level

We remark that, although for a factorizable quantum state all prequantum physical variables corresponding to quantum observables are uncorrelated, see previous section, components φ1(ω) and φ2(ω) of the prequantum field are always correlated. The covariance operator DΨ always has nonzero off-diagonal block D12  =  Ψ̂. Thus we can find other prequantum physical variables, nonquadratic functionals of the prequantum field, which are nontrivially correlated. Roughly speaking the presently used class of observables is too restricted to find this totality of correlations at the subquantum level. Not only prequantum fields corresponding to entangled quantum systems are correlated, but even prequantum fields corresponding to distinguishable quantum systems which have been prepared independently at huge distance from each other. Thus subquantum nonlocality is even more general than quantum one. However, the former is purely classical nonlocality of correlations of random fields which are coupled through the common background field.

Distinguishing property of "entangled prequantum fields"

Thus all prequantum random fields are correlated. Can one distinguish random fields corresponding to entangled quantum states from random fields corresponding to factorizable states? One of distinguishing features of "entangled prequantum fields" is impossibility to separate the "intrinsic field" of a quantum system from the background field. The intrinsic field does not exist as classical random field. This is again the problem of positive definiteness of the covariance operator. We remark that the operator [formula] is positively defined iff the quantum state Ψ̂ is factorizable, [formula] The step from factorizability to positive definiteness is trivial. For [formula] we have

[formula]

[formula]

Suppose now that Ψ is not factorizable. Consider its Schmidt decomposition [formula] where {ei1} and {ei2} are orthonormal systems in H1 and H2, respectively. We shall explore the following property of Schmidt decomposition: it contains just one summand if and only if Ψ is factorizable. Consider coordinates xi = (φ1,ei1),yi  =  (φ2,ei2). Then [formula] In the case of entanglement all coefficients αi < 1. Set xi = yi = 0, for i > 1. Then (D̃Ψφ,φ)  =  α21x21  +  2α1x1y1  +  α21y21. This quadratic form is not positively defined.

In the case of a prequantum random field corresponding to a factorizable quantum state the operator DΨ  =  D̃Ψ  +  εI and the first summand is positively defined. Consider Gaussian random fields φΨ,φ̃Ψ,η with zero mean values and the covariance operators DΨ,D̃Ψ,εI. Suppose that the "intrinsic field" of a system φ̃Ψ and the background field η are independent. Then φΨ can be represented as φΨ(ω) = φ̃Ψ(ω)  +  η(ω), where ω is a random parameter. Thus in the absence of entanglement the "intrinsic field" of a system can be distilled from the background. This is impossible for entangled states.

Conclusion. At the subquantum level entanglement is an exhibition of fundamental nonseparability from the background field.
