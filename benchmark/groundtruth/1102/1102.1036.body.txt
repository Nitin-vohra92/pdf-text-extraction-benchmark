Transit Analysis Package (TAP and autoKep):IDL Graphical User Interfaces for Extrasolar Planet Transit Photometry

Initial Code Release

TAP and autoKep are available for download at along with descriptions and example videos. A full paper will be made available shortly in which we describe comparison tests with published ground-based and Kepler light curves, as well as new data. A preprint is available at the TAP website.

In ยง[\ref=TAP] we provide a manual for the use of the MCMC fitting feature of TAP, and ยง[\ref=autoKep] provides a manual for autoKep, which is designed to streamline the reduction of pipeline-reduced MAST Kepler light curves into a form usable by TAP or any transit analysis code.

Attribution

If you use TAP in a publication, please cite this paper and the following, which provide direct contributions to the code and/or methods used by TAP:

[\citealt=2002ApJ...580L.171M] for the Mandel & Agol transit light curve model.

[\citealt=2009ApJ...704...51C], for the wavelet-based red noise treatment

[\citealt=eastman2011], for EXOFAST implementation of the Mandel & Agol model

TAP Manual:

TAP is designed to input transit light curves and fit them using the Mandel & Agol model. The input light curve data must be in ascii files in which the first column contains time in Julian Days (HJD) and the second column contains flux (normalized to an "out of transit" value of unity). Any extra columns are ignored by TAP.

Starting TAP:

Load one or multiple transits:

Adjust parameters for multiple transits:

Fit the transit light curve:

Analyze MCMC Chain(s)

autoKep Manual:

autoKep is designed to load in *llc.fits (pipeline reduced light curve) files from the Kepler MAST archive. The transits are output as ascii files and (optionally) loaded into TAP.

Starting autoKep:

Load one or multiple Kepler MAST .fits files:

Detect Transits

Adjust the Transits

Export the Transits
