The rhombic dodecahedron and semisimple actions of [formula] on CAT(0) spaces

For Mike Davis on his 60th birthday, with affection and great respect

Introduction

This article is part of a project to understand the ways in which mapping class groups and automorphism groups of free groups can act on spaces. Here we focus mainly (but not exclusively) on actions that are by semisimple isometries. This includes all cellular actions on polyhedral complexes with only finitely many isometry types of cells [\cite=mb:poly].

The action of (Fn) on the abelianization of Fn gives an epimorphism [formula]. The inverse image of [formula] is generated by , which are the obvious lifts of the elementary matrices: fixing a basis [formula] for Fn, one defines the left Nielsen transformations λij by

[formula]

.

Semisimple isometries of spaces divide into elliptics (those with fixed points) and hyperbolics (those that have a non-trivial axis of translation); conjugate isometries are of the same type. The Nielsen transformations are all conjugate in (Fn), so the semisimple actions of (Fn) on spaces divide into two classes: those where the Nielsen transformations act as hyperbolic isometries and those where they act as elliptic isometries. We shall prove that if n  ≥  4 then there are no actions of the former type. The proof (which establishes something more - Proposition [\ref=p:more]) is based on an idea of Gersten [\cite=gersten].

If n  ≥  4, then each Nielsen transformation in (Fn) fixes a point whenever (Fn) acts by semisimple isometries on a complete space.

If the dimension of the space is sufficiently small, one can promote the existence of fixed points for the individual Nielsen transformations to a fixed point for the whole group - see [\cite=mb:helly], [\cite=mrb:crelle]. And by considering induced actions, one can extend Theorem [\ref=t:ell] to finite-index subgroups [formula]: any power of a Nielsen transformation that lies in Γ fixes a point whenever Γ acts by semisimple isometries on a complete space (see Section [\ref=s:induce]). In particular, if λpij∈Γ then λpij must have finite order in [formula]; for if not then there would be a homomorphism [formula] mapping λpij non-trivially.

Despite recent progress in the understanding of maps between automorphism groups of free groups and mapping class groups, many issues remain unresolved. For example, it is unknown whether every homomorphism from (Fn) to a mapping class group has to have finite image if n  ≥  4. Closed surfaces of negative Euler characteristic admit semisimple actions on complete spaces where the elliptic isometries are the roots of multi-twists ([\cite=mb:bill], Theorem A), so Theorem [\ref=t:ell] constrains putative maps [formula].

If n  ≥  4 and [formula] is a subgroup of finite index, then every homomorphism from Γ to a mapping class group sends powers of Nielsen transformations to roots of (possibly trivial) multi-twists.

We shall prove in Theorem [\ref=t:3toMCG] that this corollary fails when n = 3.

The situation for n = 3 is completely different. In the course of their work on linear representations of [formula], Grunewald and Lubotzky [\cite=GL] proved that [formula] has a subgroup of finite index that maps onto a non-abelian free group. This gives rise to an abundance of semisimple actions of (F3) and (F3) in which the Nielsen transformations act hyperbolically, as we shall explain in Section [\ref=s:N-hyp]. But across this enormous range of actions there is a beautiful geometric invariant associated to the abelian subgroups of maximal rank generated by Nielsen transformations. Each such subgroup is conjugate to [formula]; we call it a .

The is the Catalan solid that is dual to the Archimedean cuboctahedron; it is described in more detail in Section [\ref=s:ddh]. Notice that in the following theorem no assumption is made about the discreteness of the action.

Whenever [formula] acts by semisimple isometries on a complete space X, either each Nielsen transformation fixes a point, or else each Nielsen [formula] leaves invariant an isometrically embedded 3-flat [formula] on which it acts as a discrete group of translations with Dirichlet domain a rhombic dodecahedron.

When n  ≥  6 one can sharpen Theorem [\ref=t:ell] by proving that in any action of (Fn) by isometries on a complete space the Nielsen transformations have zero translation length, i.e. they are either elliptic or else they are neutral parabolics. Actions of the second type arise from linear representations [formula] via the action of [formula] on its symmetric space. The fact that Nielsen transformations must act as neutral parabolics imposes constraints on the representation theory of (Fn) that supplement [\cite=DF] and [\cite=rapin]. In Section [\ref=s:kahler] we explain how the rigidity of the standard linear representation [\cite=DF] can be combined with Simpson's results [\cite=carlos] to prove:

If n  ≥  2, then neither (Fn) nor (Fn) is the fundamental group of a compact Kähler manifold.

Isometries of CAT(0) spaces and centralizers

Our basic reference for spaces and their isometries is [\cite=BH]. Let X be a complete space. The of an isometry [formula] is [formula], and [formula]. An isometry is termed if [formula] is non-empty. Semisimple isometries divide into (when [formula]) and ([formula]). Isometries for which [formula] are termed ( or according to whether [formula]).

The following basic result is proved on page 231 of [\cite=BH].

If γ is hyperbolic, then [formula] splits isometrically as [formula], where γ acts trivially on the first factor and as [formula] on the second factor. If [formula] commutes with γ, then it leaves [formula] invariant, preserves its splitting, and acts by translation on the second factor.

We also need the following form of the Flat Torus Theorem ([\cite=BH], page 254). A k-flat is an isometrically embedded copy of k-dimensional Euclidean space.

Let γ and δ be commuting hyperbolic isometries. We write [formula] if at some (hence any) point [formula] the axes of γ and δ through x are orthogonal. Equivalently, the action of δ on the second factor of [formula] is trivial.

We write ZG(S) for the centralizer of a set S in a group G. We write H1(G) for the abelianisation of G and

[formula]

Induced actions

Let G be a group and let H  ⊂  G be a subgroup of index d. Just as one induces an n-dimensional linear representation of H to obtain an nd-dimensional representation of G, so one can induce an action of H by isometries of a metric space X to obtain an action of G by isometries on Xd (with the product metric). One way to view this induction (following [\cite=tomD] p.35) is to identify Xd with the space of H-equivariant maps f:G  →  X with the action (g.f)(γ)  =  f(γg- 1).

The following lemma is covered in [\cite=BH], p.231-232.

Suppose H has index d in G and that H acts by isometries on a complete space X. If gp∈H acts as a hyperbolic isometry, where p is a non-zero integer, then g acts hyperbolically in the induced action of G on Xd.

One can also express induction in its group-theoretic form, the . Recall that [formula] is the semidirect product [formula], where the Ab are isomorphic copies of A permuted by left translation. [formula] is called the base of the wreath product. If B is finite and A acts on X by isometries, then there is an obvious action of W by isometries on XB, with B permuting the factors and Ab acting as A in the b-coordinate and trivially in the others. The induction described above is then just a manifestation of the following standard lemma. To avoid complications we assume that H is normal in G.

If H is normal in G and φ:H  →  Q is a homomorphism, then there is a homomorphism [formula] so that [formula] and for all h∈H the coordinate of Φ(h) in Q1 is φ(h).

Automorphisms that cannot act hyperbolically

Throughout this article, Fn denotes a free group of rank n. We work with the left action of [formula] on Fn and the commutator convention =  αβα- 1β- 1. (So

[formula]

respects the defining relations of the group Gp,q of Lemma [\ref=l:pq] and hence defines a homomorphism [formula]. Thus any action of [formula] by semisimple isometries on a complete (0) space gives rise to an action of Gp,q, and Lemma [\ref=l:pq] tells us that Rw, the image of α∈Gp,q must act elliptically.

Our interest in the following lemma lies with the case n = 3.

Let n  ≥  3. Whenever [formula] acts by semisimple isometries on a complete (0) space, the inner automorphisms corresponding to primitive elements are elliptic.

If n  ≥  4, then the preceding proposition implies that the right Nielsen transformations ρij are elliptic, hence so are their conjugates λij. The inner automorphism corresponding to a primitive element, say a1 from the basis [formula], is a composition of commuting Nielsen transformations: [formula], and a product of commuting elliptic isometries is elliptic.

When n = 3 the Nielsen transformations need not be elliptic, so we require a different argument. Let {a,b,c} be a basis for F3 and let [formula] be the automorphism

[formula]

defines a homomorphism [formula] sending α to [formula], so Lemma [\ref=l:pq] implies that [formula] must be elliptic.

The maps [formula] and [formula] used in the preceding proofs are injective, but since we do not need this fact we omit the proof.

The free-abelian subgroups of [formula] have rank at most 4. Every maximal abelian subgroup of rank 4 is conjugate to M: = 〈λ21,ρ21,λ31,ρ31〉, which intersects the group of inner automorphisms in the cyclic group generated by [formula].

Let X be a complete (0) space. If [formula] is a Nielsen-hyperbolic action, then Φ(M) leaves invariant an isometrically embedded 3-flat E  ⊂  X; [formula] acts trivially on E while [formula] acts properly and cocompactly by translations with fundamental domain a rhombic dodecahedron.

By the Flat Torus Theorem, M leaves invariant an n-flat E  ⊂  X on which it acts cocompactly by translations; we know only that this flat has dimension between 1 and 4. Lemma [\ref=l:inner] tells us that the action of [formula] acts elliptically on X, and hence trivially on E. Thus the action of M on E factors through [formula] and E has dimension at most 3. Lemma [\ref=l:ortho] tells us that the axes of λi1 are orthogonal to those of ρi1 for i = 2,3, and hence ****

The rhombic dodecahedron

The is one of the Catalan solids; it is dual to the Archimedean solid known as the cuboctahedron. It has fourteen vertices and twelve faces. The faces are rhombi whose diagonals have lengths in the ratio [formula].

Consider the standard tiling of [formula] by unit cubes and fix a vertex u. The rhombic dodecahedron can be constructed as the convex hull of the endpoints of the six edges incident at u together with the centres of the eight cubes incident at u. In other words, it is the Voronoi cell for the face-centred cubic lattice (and therefore occurs naturally in many crystal formations).

It follows from this description that the rhombic dodecahedron is a Dirichlet domain for the free abelian group of rank 3 that translates [formula] by integer vectors (a,b,c) with a + b + c even. This is the group generated by the edge-vectors of an octahedron dual to a cube with edge-length 2. For our purposes, it is convenient to rephrase this as follows.

Let [formula] be the [formula]-module generated by unit vectors u1,u2,v1,v2. If

u1 + u2 = v1 + v2,

[formula] and [formula], and

[formula],

then A is discrete and [formula] is a rhombic dodecahedron.

Note that the conclusion of the lemma includes the observation that A is not contained in a plane. Thus one cannot find such vectors u1,u2,v1,v2 in [formula] for d < 3.

Let Γ be a group. Suppose that α1,α2,β1,β2 commute and are conjugate in Γ. Let A = 〈α1,α2,β1,β2〉 and suppose that

α1α2  =  β1β2,

α1∈[null] and β1∈[null], and

there exists [formula] with γ- 1(β1β- 12)γ  =  α2α- 11.

Then, whenever Γ acts by semisimple isometries on a complete (0) space X, either A fixes a point, or A leaves invariant an isometrically embedded 3-flat [formula], acting properly and cocompactly on it by isometries, with Dirichlet domain a rhombic dodecahedron.

Since the given generators of A are all conjugate, either all are elliptic or all are hyperbolic. If they are elliptic, then they have a common fixed point, since they commute. If they are hyperbolic, then by the Flat Torus Theorem A leaves invariant a k-flat E  ⊂  X, with k  ≤  3, and acts on it by translations; since the ai and bi are hyperbolic, they act non-trivially on E, and since they are conjugate in Γ, their translations lengths are equal. Let ui (resp. vi) be the translation vector of αi|E (resp. βi|E). According to Lemma [\ref=l:null], condition (ii) implies that [formula] and [formula] and condition (iii) implies that [formula]. Lemma [\ref=l:octo] (with the remark that follows it) completes the proof.

The above proposition admits obvious variations in which conditions (ii) and (iii) are altered to allow parts (2) and (3) of Lemma [\ref=l:null] to be applied in different combinations.

The shape of Nielsen-hyperbolic actions of (F3)

The free abelian subgroups of Aut(F3) have rank at most 4 (the virtual cohomological dimension of Aut(F3)). Each Nielsen [formula] is conjugate to Λ  =  〈λ21,  ρ21,  λ31,  ρ31〉.

Proposition [\ref=p:makeDDH] applies directly to the image of Λ in [formula].

In [formula], the elements α1: = λ- 121,  α2: = ρ21,  β1  =  λ- 131,  β2  =  ρ31 and γ  =  ε2 satisfy the conditions of Proposition [\ref=p:makeDDH].

In [formula] we have [formula], so α1α2  =  β1β2.

A direct calculation yields the well-known relation   =  λ- 121, and both λ23,  λ31 commute with ρ21. Thus λ21 lies in the commutator subgroup of ρ21. Likewise,   =  ρ- 121 implies that ρ21 is in the commutator subgroup of λ21.

Conjugation by ε2 leaves λ31 and ρ31 fixed while interchanging λ- 121 and ρ21.

Proposition [\ref=p:makeDDH] does not apply directly to [formula] but the difficulty is a minor one.

. Suppose that [formula] is acting by isometries on a complete (0) space X with the Nielsen moves λij acting as hyperbolic isometries. According to the Flat Torus Theorem, [formula] leaves invariant a k-flat E  ⊂  X on which it acts by translations, with the generators λij and ρij (which are conjugate in [formula]) acting non-trivially by translations of the same length. Lemma [\ref=l:inner] tells us that [formula] acts elliptically on X and hence trivially on E. Replacing E by the convex hull of a Λ-orbit, we may assume that it has dimension at most 3.

The calculations in the proof of Lemma [\ref=l:out3] allow us to apply Lemma [\ref=l:null]: as in the proof of Proposition [\ref=p:makeDDH], it implies that the translation vectors of λ21|E,  ρ21|E,  λ31|E,  ρ31|E satisfy the conditions of Lemma [\ref=l:octo]. Hence E has dimension 3 (remark [\ref=rem]), the action of [formula] is proper and cocompact, and a Dirichlet domain for the action is a rhombic dodecahedron.

An abundance of actions when n = 3

Let Γ be an arbitrary finitely generated group. In this section we shall assign to each action of Γ on a { space X actions of Aut(F3) and [formula] on the Cartesian product of finitely many copies of X. The assignment is such that if the generators of Γ act as hyperbolic isometries, then the induced actions of Aut(F3) and [formula] will be Nielsen-hyperbolic.

The heart of the construction is the following proposition.

For each positive integer k, there exists a subgroup of finite index [formula] and a surjective homomorphism πk:Hk  →  Fk such that the image of πk is generated by the images of powers of conjugates of Nielsen transformations λij.

Fix a basis {a1,a2,a3} for F3. We first construct a map from a subgroup of finite index in [formula] to a free group of rank 2 so that the image is generated by powers of λ12 and λ21. This map is based on a construction of Grunewald and Lubotzky [\cite=GL] (cf. [\cite=BVsurv], Qu.9).

Regard F3 as the fundamental group of a graph R with one vertex. The loops of length one are labelled {a1,a2,a3}. Consider the 2-sheeted covering R̂  →  R with fundamental group 〈a1,a2,a23,a3a1a- 13,a3a2a- 13〉 and let [formula] be the stabilizer of this subgroup.

G acts on [formula] leaving invariant the eigenspaces of the involution that generates the Galois group of the covering. The eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue - 1 is two dimensional with basis {a1 - a3a1a- 13,  a2 - a3a2a- 13}. The action of G with respect to this basis gives an epimorphism [formula]. By replacing G with a subgroup of finite index one can ensure that the inner automorphisms in G act trivially on [formula] (because [formula] has finite image in [formula], which is virtually torsion-free). If Q is the image of G in [formula], then we have a map [formula] whose image is of finite index.

Since [formula] has a free subgroup of finite-index, by passing to a further subgroup if necessary we may assume that μ(Q) is free. We choose p so that λp12,λp21∈Q. The images of μ(λ12) and μ(λ21) generate a subgroup of finite index in [formula], so the subgroup L2 generated by a: = μ(λp12) and b: = μ(λp21) is free of rank 2. Applying Marshall Hall's theorem, we pass to a subgroup of finite index in μ(Q) that retracts onto L2. Let H2 be the inverse image of this subgroup in Q and let π:H2  →  L2 be its surjection to L2.

In L2  =  〈a,b〉 one has the subgroup Lk of index k - 1 with basis [formula]; this is free of rank k and is generated by conjugates of powers of a and b. Thus it suffices to take Hk  =  π- 1(Lk).

Induced actions

Let Γ be a group generated by the image of an epimorphism ψ:Fr  →  Γ from a finitely generated free group. Suppose that Γ acts by isometries on a complete { space X. By composing ψ with the map Hr  →  Fr constructed in the preceding proposition, we obtain a surjection Hr  →  Γ sending powers of certain Nielsen transformations to generators of Γ. And by inducing the action we obtain an action of (F3) on a product of finitely many copies of X. If the action of Γ on X was by hyperbolic isometries, then the Nielsen transformations act as hyperbolic isometries in this induced action.

Homomorphisms from [formula] to mapping class groups

We saw in the introduction that when n  ≥  4, any homomorphism from [formula] to a mapping class group must send Nielsen transformations to roots of multi-twists. We also noted that no homomorphisms with infinite image are known to exist. The situation for n = 3 is completely different. Let Sg be the closed surface of genus g and let [formula] be its mapping class group. Let [formula] be the mapping class group of the genus g surface with one boundary component.

For certain positive integers g, there exist homomorphisms [formula] sending Nielsen transformations to elements of infinite order that are not roots of multi-twists.

I do not know the value of the least integer g for which there is such a homomorphism (and likewise for [formula]).

For all positive integers h and all non-trivial finite groups G, there exist integers g for which there is an injective homomorphism [formula].

Every finite group has a faithful realisation as a group of symmetries of a closed hyperbolic surface (and therefore embeds in the mapping class group of that surface). We realise G on the surface Y and equivariantly delete an open disc about each point in a free orbit. We then glue a copy of Sh,1 to each of the resulting boundary components and extend the action of G in the obvious manner. Let Sg be the resulting surface.

Corresponding to each of the attached copies of Sh,1 there is an injective homomorphism [formula] obtained by extending homeomorphisms to be the identity on the complement of the attached copy of Sh,1. (The extension respects isotopy classes.) Thus we obtain |G| commuting copies [formula] of [formula] in [formula]. The action of [formula] by conjugation permutes the Mg and the canonical map [formula] is injective.

Let Fr be a free group of rank r that maps onto [formula] sending at least one basis element, say a1, to an element of infinite order ψ∈Γ that is not a root of a multi-twist. Proposition [\ref=p:aut3toF] provides a normal subgroup of finite index [formula] that maps onto Fr sending a power of a Nielsen transformation, say λp, to a1. Thus we obtain a homomorphism Hr  →  Γ sending λp to ψ. We replace Hr with a subgroup of finite index that is normal in [formula] (with quotient Ω, say) and consider the induced homomorphism [formula] as in Lemma [\ref=l:wr]. As in Proposition [\ref=l:sg], this wreath product acts on a closed surface Sg. By construction, a non-zero power of λp acts on one of the subsurfaces Sh,1 as a non-zero power of ψ and hence the image of λ in [formula] is not a root of a multi-twist.

Nielsen generators are not ballistic if n  ≥  6

Let [formula] be a Nielsen generator and let Z be its centralizer. If n  ≥  6, then = 0 in [formula].

For any n  ≥  2 one can realise λ as a Dehn twist δ about a non-separating curve on a compact orientable surface S that has genus ⌊n / 2⌋ and euler characterisic (1 - n). More precisely, taking a basepoint on the boundary of S, there is an isomorphism from π1S to Fn that induces a homomorphism from the mapping class group [formula] to [formula] sending δ to λ.

Let C(δ) be the centralizer of δ in [formula]. The map from 〈δ〉  =  〈λ〉 to [formula] factors through [formula], so it is enough to prove that δ has trivial image in [formula]. If δ is the twist in a loop c, then C(δ) is the image of the natural map to [formula] of the mapping class group of the surface S' obtained by cutting S open along c. Thus it is enough to prove that in a surface S' of genus at least 2, the Dehn twist in any loop c parallel to a boundary curve is trivial in [formula]. This can be seen using the lantern relation [\cite=korkmaz]. In more detail, the lantern relation involves 7 loops on a 4-holed sphere; if one embeds the 4-holed sphere in S' so that one of the loops is sent to c and the remaining 6 loops are non-separating, then the relation takes the form δ0δ1δ2δ3  =  δ4δ5δ6, where δ0 is the twist in c and the remaining δi are positive twists in non-separating loops. The twists in any two non-separating loops are conjugate in [formula], hence equal (to τ say) in [formula]. So in H1 the above relation becomes δ0τ3  =  τ3.

Suppose n  ≥  6. Whenever [formula] acts by isometries on a complete (0) space, the Nielsen generators λij and ρij have zero translation length (i.e. they are either elliptic or else they are neutral parabolics).

A lemma of Karlsson and Margulis [\cite=KM] can be used to show that if an isometry γ of a complete space has positive translation length then γ must have infinite order in the abelianisation of its centralizer (cf. the proof of [\cite=mb:bill] Theorem 1). Lemma [\ref=l:dehn] completes the proof.

This result places constraints on the representation theory of [formula]. I shall return to this point in another article but note one example here for illustrative purposes.

Let [formula] be a Nielsen transformation and let [formula] be an arbitrary representation. If n  ≥  6, then the eigenvalues of Φ(λ) all have modulus 1.

The symmetric space [formula] is non-positively curved and the action of [formula] has positive translation length if M has an eigenvalue of modulus greater than 1 (equivalently, the hyperbolic component in its Jordan decomposition is non-trivial).

[formula] and [formula] are not Kähler groups

One can deduce from Corollary [\ref=c:evalues] that the standard representation [formula] (given by the action of [formula] on [formula]) cannot be deformed locally to anything but a conjugate representation. A stonger result was proved by Dyer and Formanek [\cite=DF] (see also [\cite=rapin] Theorem 1.2): every representation [formula] factors through the standard representation. Using Proposition 3.1 of [\cite=BV11] one can extend the proof in [\cite=rapin] to cover the unique index-2 subgroup [formula].

Every finitely presented group is the fundamental group of a closed symplectic manifold and of a closed complex manifold, but not every finitely presented group is a Kähler group, i.e. the fundamental group of a closed Kähler manifold (see [\cite=A+] for context and references). For example, a Kähler group cannot split over a finite group as an alamagamated free product or HNN extension, it cannot have a subgroup of finite index that has odd first betti number, and it cannot be an extension of a group with infinitely many ends by a finitely generated group. This last condition covers [formula] and [formula]. But if n  ≥  3 then [formula] has property FA and it seems likely (but is unproved) that all of its subgroups of finite index have finite abelianization. There is, however, a more subtle obstruction coming from Simpson's work on non-abelian Hodge theory that one can use to show that [formula] and [formula] are not Kähler.

Simpson [\cite=carlos] proves that if a group Γ admits a representation [formula] with image [formula], where n  ≥  3, and if this representation cannot be deformed locally into a non-conjugate representation, then Γ is not Kähler. In more detail, if Γ were Kähler then the real Zariski closure of ρ(Γ) would be a group of Hodge type ([\cite=carlos], Lemma 4.4), but [formula] is not of Hodge type (n  ≥  3) -- see [\cite=carlos], p.50-51. We noted above that the standard representation of [formula] is rigid. And a finite index subgroup of a Kähler group is (obviously) a Kähler group.
