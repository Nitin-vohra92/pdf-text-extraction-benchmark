Prandtl and Rayleigh number dependence of heat transport in high Rayleigh number thermal convection

Introduction

In Rayleigh-Bénard (RB) convection fluid in a box is heated from below and cooled from above ([\cite=ahl09]). This system is paradigmatic for turbulent heat transfer, with many applications in atmospheric and environmental physics, astrophysics, and process technology. Its dynamics is characterized by the Rayleigh number Ra  =  βgΔL3 / (κν) and the Prandtl number Pr   =  ν  /  κ. Here, L is the height of the sample, β is the thermal expansion coefficient, g the gravitational acceleration, Δ the temperature difference between the bottom and the top of the sample, and ν and κ the kinematic viscosity and the thermal diffusivity, respectively. Almost all experimental and numerical results on the heat transfer, indicated by the Nusselt number Nu, agree up to Ra  ≈  2  ×  1011 (see the review of [\cite=ahl09] for detailed references) and are in agreement with the description of the Grossmann-Lohse (GL) theory ([\cite=gro00] [\cite=gro01] [\cite=gro02] [\cite=gro04]). However, for higher Ra the situation is less clear.

Most experiments for [formula] are performed in samples with aspect ratios [formula] and Γ = 0.23, where D and L are the diameter and height of the sample, respectively. The majority of these experiments are performed with liquid helium near its critical point ([\cite=cha01] [\cite=nie00] [\cite=nie01] [\cite=nie06] [\cite=roc01] [\cite=roc02] [\cite=roc10]). While [\cite=nie00] [\cite=nie01] and [\cite=nie06] found a Nu increase with [formula], the experiments by [\cite=cha01] and [\cite=roc01] [\cite=roc02] [\cite=roc10] gave a steep Nu increase with [formula]. In these helium experiments the Pr  number increases with increasing Ra. [\cite=fun09] and [\cite=ahl09c] [\cite=ahl09d] performed measurements around room temperature with high pressurized gases with nearly constant Pr  and do not find such a steep increase. [\cite=nie10b] found two [formula] branches in a Γ = 1 sample. The high Ra number branch is 20% higher than the low Ra number branch. By necessity, Nu increases more steeply in the transition region. The scaling in the transition region happens to be around [formula]. There are thus considerable differences in the heat transfer obtained in these different experiments in the high Ra number regime. Very recently, Ahlers and coworkers (see [\cite=ahl10] and addendum to [\cite=ahl09d]) even found two different branches in one experiments with the steepest branch going as [formula].

There is no clear explanation for this disagreement although it has been conjectured that variations of the Pr  number, the use of constant temperature or a constant heat flux condition at the bottom plate, the finite conductivity of the horizontal plates and side wall, non Oberbeck-Boussinesq effects, i.e. the dependence of the fluid properties on the temperature, the existence of multiple turbulent states ([\cite=gro11]), and even wall roughness and temperature conditions outside the sample might play a role. Since the above differences among experiments might be induced by unavoidable technicalities in the laboratory set-ups, within this context, direct numerical simulations are the only possibility to obtain neat reference data that strictly adhere to the intended theoretical problem and that could be used as guidelines to interpret the experiments: This is the main motivation for the present study.

Numerical procedure

We start this paper with a description of the numerical procedure that is used to investigate the influence on the heat transfer for two of the issues mentioned above. First, we discuss the effect of the Pr  number on the heat transport in the high Ra number regime. Subsequently, we will discuss the difference between simulations performed with a constant temperature at the bottom plate with simulations with a constant heat flux at the bottom plate. We take the constant heat flux condition only at the bottom plate, because in real setups the bottom plate is in contact with a heater while the top plate is connected to a thermostatic bath. Thus, the condition of constant heat flux applies at most only to the bottom plate ([\cite=nie00] [\cite=nie01] and [\cite=nie06]). At the top plate constant temperature boundary conditions are assumed to strictly hold, i.e. perfect heat transfer to the recirculating cooling liquid. We will conclude the paper with a brief summary, discussion, and outlook to future simulations.

The flow is solved by numerically integrating the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations within the Boussinesq approximation. The numerical method is already described in [\cite=ver97] [\cite=ver03] and [\cite=ver08] and here it is sufficient to mention that the equations in cylindrical coordinates are solved by central second-order accurate finite-difference approximations in space and time. We performed simulations with constant temperature conditions at the bottom plate for 2  ×  107 < Ra < 1  ×  1012 and 0.5 < Pr < 10 in an aspect ratio Γ = 0.23 sample. We also present results for a simulation at [formula] at Pr = 0.7 in a Γ = 0.5 sample. In addition, we performed simulation with a constant heat flux at the bottom plate and a constant temperature at the top plate, see [\cite=ver08] for details, for Pr = 0.7, Γ = 0.5, and [formula]. Because in all simulations the temperature boundary conditions are precisely assigned, the surfaces are infinitely smooth, and the Boussinesq approximation is unconditionally valid, the simulations provide a clear reference case for present and future experiments.

In [\cite=ste10] we investigated the resolution criteria that should be satisfied in a fully resolved DNS simulation and [\cite=shi10] determined the minimal number of nodes that should be placed inside the boundary layers. The resolutions used here are based on this experience and we stress that in this study we used even better spatial resolution than we used in [\cite=ste10] to be sure that the flow is fully resolved.

To give the reader some idea of the scale of this study we mention the resolutions that were used in the most demanding simulations, i.e., simulations that take at least 100.000 DEISA CPU hours each. For Γ = 0.23 this are the simulations at [formula], which are performed on either a 641  ×  185  ×  1281 (azimuthal, radial, and axial number of nodes) grid for Pr = 0.7 and Pr = 2.0 or on a 769  ×  257  ×  1537 grid for Pr = 4.38 and Pr = 6.4. The simulations at [formula] are performed on a [formula] grid. The simulations for [formula] were run for at least 100 dimensionless time units (defined as [formula]), while these simulations at [formula] cover about 30 - 40 time units. The simulation with a constant heat flux condition at the bottom plate and constant temperature condition at the top plate in a Γ = 0.5 sample with Pr = 0.7 at Ra = 2.25  ×  1011 is performed on a 1081  ×  351  ×  1301 grid. The simulation at [formula] with Pr = 0.7 in the Γ = 0.5 sample has been performed on a 2701  ×  671  ×  2501 grid, which makes it the largest fully bounded turbulent flow simulation ever. This simulation takes about 100.000 vectorial CPU hours on HLRS (equivalent to ≈  9  ×  106 DEISA CPU hours). To store one snapshot of the field (T, u1,u3, because u2 follows from continuity) costs 160 GB in binary format. A snapshot of this flow is shown in figure [\ref=fig:figure1]. Movies of this simulation are included in the supplementary material.

Numerical results on Nu(Ra,Pr,Γ)

In figure [\ref=fig:figure2]a and figure [\ref=fig:figure2b] the DNS results for Pr = 0.7 in the Γ = 0.23 and Γ = 0.5 samples are compared with experimental data. The result for [formula] in the Γ = 0.5 sample agrees well with the experimental data of [\cite=nie00] [\cite=nie01], [\cite=nie06], [\cite=fun09], and [\cite=ahl09c] [\cite=ahl09d], while there is a visible difference with the results of [\cite=cha01]. A comparison of the results for Γ = 0.23 with the experimental data of [\cite=roc10] shows that there is a good agreement for higher Ra numbers, while for lower Ra we obtain slightly larger Nu than in those experiments. We again stress that we performed resolution checks for this Γ = 0.23 case (up to [formula]), and in addition considering the good agreement with the results for Γ = 0.5, we exclude that our DNS results overestimate Nu.

Figure [\ref=fig:figure2]b and [\ref=fig:figure2b] show that in some experiments the Pr  number increases with increasing Ra. This difference in Pr  is often mentioned as one of the possible causes for the observed differences in the heat transfer between the experiments. Figure [\ref=fig:figure3] shows the Nu number as function of Pr  for different Ra. This figure shows that the effect of the Pr  number on the heat transfer decreases with increasing Ra. This means that the differences in the heat transport that are observed between the experiments for [formula], see figure [\ref=fig:figure2]a and [\ref=fig:figure2b]a, are not a Pr  number effect. This is in agreement with the theoretical prediction of the GL-model for Γ = 1, which is shown in figure [\ref=fig:figure3].

Scaling of thermal and kinetic boundary layers

We determined the thermal and kinetic BL thickness for the simulations in the Γ = 0.23 sample. The horizontally averaged thermal BL thickness (λθ) is determined from λslθ(r), where λslθ(r) is the intersection point between the linear extrapolation of the temperature gradient at the plate with the behavior found in the bulk ([\cite=ste10b]). In figure [\ref=fig:figure6]a it is shown that the scaling of the thermal BL thickness is consistent with the Nu number measurements when the horizontal average is taken over the entire plate.

The horizontally averaged kinetic BL thickness (λu) is determined from λ"u(r), where λ"u(r) is based on the position where the quantity [formula] reaches its maximum. We use this quantity as [\cite=ste10] and [\cite=shi10] showed that it represents the kinetic BL thickness better than other available methods. [\cite=ste10b] [\cite=ste10] also explained that this quantity cannot be used close to the sidewall as here it misrepresents the kinetic BL thickness. For numerical reasons, it can neither be calculated accurately in the center region. To be on the safe side we horizontally average the kinetic BL between 0.25D / 2 < r < 0.75D / 2, where D indicates the diameter of the cell and all given values refer to that used.

Figure [\ref=fig:figure6]b reveals that for Pr = 0.7 the kinetic and thermal BL thickness have the same scaling and thickness over a wide range of Ra. In figure [\ref=fig:figure7] the ratio λu  /  λθ is compared with results of the Prandtl-Blasius BL theory. We find a constant difference of about 15% between the numerical results and the theoretical PB type prediction, see e.g. [\cite=shi10]. We emphasize that the deviation of the prefactor of only 15% is remarkably small, given that the PB boundary layer theory has been developed for parallel flow over an infinite flat plate, whereas here in the aspect ratio Γ = 0.23 cell one can hardly find such regions of parallel flows at the top and bottom plates. Nonetheless, the scaling and even the ratio of the kinetic and thermal boundary layer thicknesses for these large Ra numbers is well described by Prandtl-Blasius BL theory. This result agrees with the experimental results of [\cite=qiu98] and [\cite=sun08]. Indeed, [\cite=qiu98] showed that the kinetic BL near the sidewall obeys the scaling law of the Prandtl-Blasius laminar BL and [\cite=sun08] showed the same for the boundary layers near the bottom plate. Recently, [\cite=zho10] [\cite=zho10b] have developed a method of expressing velocity profiles in the time-dependent BL frame and found that not only the scaling obeys the PB expectation, but even the rescaled velocity and temperature profiles From all this we can exclude that at [formula] the BL is turbulent.

Constant temperature versus constant heat flux condition at the bottom plate

It has also been argued that the different boundary conditions at the bottom plate, i.e.  that some experiments are closer to a constant temperature boundary condition, and some are closer to a constant heat flux boundary condition, might explain the differences in the heat transport that are observed in the high Ra number regime. Figure [\ref=fig:figure4]a compares the Nu number in the simulations with constant temperature and constant heat flux at the bottom plate. The figure shows that the difference between these both cases is small and even decreases with increasing Ra. For large Ra no difference at all is seen within the (statistical) error bars, which however increase due to the shorter averaging time (in terms of large eddy turnovers) at the very large [formula].

Figure [\ref=fig:figure4]b shows the time-averaged temperature of the bottom plate in the simulations with constant heat flux at the bottom plate for different Ra. The radial dependence at the lower Ra numbers can be understood from the flow structure in the sample: Due to the large scale circulation the fluid velocities are largest in the middle of the sample. Thus in the middle more heat can be extracted from the plate than close to the sidewall where the fluid velocities are smaller. It is the lack of any wind in the corners of the sample that causes the relative high time-averaged plate temperature there. The figure also shows that this effect decreases with increasing Ra. The reason for this is that the turbulence becomes stronger at higher Ra and this leads to smaller flow structures. Therefore the region close to the sidewall with relative small fluid velocities decreases with increasing Ra and this leads to a more uniform plate temperature at higher Ra. This effect explains that the simulations with constant temperature and constant heat flux condition at the bottom plate become more similar with increasing Ra.

The small differences between the simulations with constant temperature and constant heat flux at the bottom plate shows that the differences between the experiments in the high Ra number regime can not be explained by different plate conductivity properties. This finding is in agreement with the results of [\cite=joh09]. In their periodic two-dimensional RB simulations the heat transfer for simulations with constant temperature and constant heat flux (both at the bottom and the top plate) becomes equal at Ra  ≈  5  ×  106. For the three-dimensional simulations the heat transfer for both cases also becomes equal, but at higher Ra. This is due to the geometrical effect discussed before, see figure [\ref=fig:figure4]b, that cannot occur in periodic two-dimensional simulations ([\cite=joh09]).

Conclusions

In summary, we presented results from three-dimensional DNS simulations for RB convection in cylindrical samples of aspect ratios Γ = 0.23 and Γ = 0.5 up to [formula] and a broad range of Pr  numbers. The simulation at [formula] with Pr = 0.7 in an aspect ratio Γ = 0.5 sample is in good agreement with the experimental results of [\cite=nie00] [\cite=nie01], [\cite=nie06], [\cite=fun09], and [\cite=ahl09c] [\cite=ahl09d], while there is a visible difference with the results of [\cite=cha01]. In addition, we showed that the differences in the heat transfer observed between experiments for [formula] can neither be explained by Pr  number effects, nor by the assumption of constant heat flux conditions at the bottom plate instead of constant temperature conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the scaling of the kinetic and thermal BL thicknesses in this high Ra number regime is well described by the Prandtl-Blasius theory.

Several questions remain: Which effect is responsible for the observed difference in Nu vs Ra scaling in the various experiments? Are there perhaps different turbulent states in the highly turbulent regime as has been suggested for RB flow by [\cite=gro11], but also for other turbulent flows in closed systems by [\cite=cor10]? At what Ra number do the BLs become turbulent? As in DNSs both the velocity and temperature fields are known in the whole domain (including in the boundary layers where the transition between the states is suggested to take place), they will play a leading role in answering these questions.
