A Nonlinear Elliptic PDE with Two Sobolev-HardyCritical Exponents

and Chang-Shou Lin

Introduction

Let 0  ≤  s  ≤  2, [formula] and [formula] denote the space of f with [formula]. It is well known that the inclusion [formula] is a family of non-compact embeddings. In this paper, we want to study the combined effect of two such Sobolev-Hardy critical exponents on a nonlinear partial differential equation. More precisely, we consider

[formula]

where 0  ≤  s2 < s1  ≤  2 and [formula]. Throughout the paper, Ω is a bounded smooth domain in [formula] with 0∈∂Ω.

Our motivation for studying equation [\eqref=1equation] comes from the celebrated Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequality [\cite=CKN]: there exists a constant C such that for any [formula], the inequality holds, where [formula], 0  ≤  b - a  ≤  1 and [formula]. Let D1,2a(Ω) be the completion of C∞0(Ω) with the norm [formula], and set Naturally, we ask whether the best constant S(a,b;Ω) can be attained by some [formula]. For the past twenty years, this problem has been extensively studied. For recent development, we refer the readers to [\cite=BPZ] [\cite=CH] [\cite=CW1] [\cite=CLW] [\cite=CC] [\cite=TE] [\cite=GK] [\cite=GR] [\cite=L] [\cite=LIN] [\cite=LW] [\cite=HL] and the references therein.

When 0∈∂Ω, this problem was first studied by Ghoussoub-Kang [\cite=GK] and Ghoussoub-Robert [\cite=GR], also see [\cite=CLW]. In [\cite=CLW], among other things, Chern and the second author of this paper proved the following theorem.

When a = 0 and 0 < b < 1, Theorem [\ref=thmathm] was first proved by Ghoussoub and Robert [\cite=GR]. The proof of Theorem [\ref=thmathm] in [\cite=CLW] is to make use of a transformation: u(x) = |x|- av(x). Straightforward computations give where λ = a(N - 2 - a). Then S(a,b;Ω) is equal to the following best constant:

[formula]

where λ = a(N - 2 - a) and s = (b - a)q∈[null], [formula] and let u(x)  ≥  0 be a solution of

[formula]

Suppose [formula]. Then [formula].

Proof. The main step is to show that [formula] as did in Lemma [\ref=lem31]. This second proof could work for the general situation of [\eqref=31equation], but the boundedness of u is required! The proof is divided into several steps.

Step 1. u(x)  →  0 as |x|  →    +    ∞  . Suppose not. We may assume there are xj  →    +    ∞  , u(xj)  ≥  C > 0 for some positive constant C. Let uj(x) = u(x + xj). By elliptic estimates, uj(x) is bounded in C2 in any compact set of [formula]. By passing to a subsequence, we may assume uj(x)  →  u(x) in [formula] and u(x) satisfies

[formula]

But it is well-known that [\eqref=2.14] has no positive solutions. Thus, [formula] in [formula] which contradicts to u(0)  ≥  C > 0. So, Step 1 is proved.

Step 2. We claim for any λ  >  0,

[formula]

where [formula]. This step is a standard application of the method of moving planes. We give a sketch of proofs for the sake of completeness. Let

[formula]

Then we have

[formula]

Thus wλ(y) satisfies

[formula]

where

[formula]

By Step 1, C2(y)  =  o(1) as |y|  →    +    ∞   and y∈Σλ.

To prove wλ(y) > 0 in Σλ for λ small, we consider the comparison function,

[formula]

and let

[formula]

Thus, [formula] satisfies

[formula]

Choose λ small such that

[formula]

Now suppose the set [formula].

Because [formula] on ∂Σλ and [formula], it is easy to see the minimum of [formula] can be achieved. Let [formula] such that

[formula]

Since [formula],

[formula]

By applying the maximum principle, [\eqref=2.15] yields

[formula]

which is a contradiction. Hence, wλ(y) > 0 [formula].

Let

[formula]

We claim [formula]. Otherwise, we have

[formula]

by the strong maximum principle and Hopf boundary point lemma. By the definition of [formula], there are [formula] such that [formula]. Set

[formula]

where

[formula]

Then [formula] satisfies

[formula]

Suppose [formula] By [\eqref=2.16], we have [formula]. Note that

[formula]

Again, by the maximum principle, [\eqref=2.17] yields a contradiction. Therefore, Step 2 is proved. Obviously, the conclusion of Lemma [\ref=lem31] follows immediately from Step 2. After the proof [formula], it is clear from the last step in the proof of Theorem [\ref=3theorem], that the conclusion of Theorem [\ref=sec3thm] holds.

If Pi  =  Pj [formula], then the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem31] still holds. Hence, in this case, the boundedness assumption is not necessary for the conclusion of Theorem [\ref=sec3thm].

Existence of Entire Solutions

In this section, we will give a proof of Theorem [\ref=2theorem]. To prove Theorem [\ref=2theorem], we choose a convex domain Ω with 0∈∂Ω and consider the following equation. For any small ε > 0

[formula]

where p1(ε) = 2*(s1) - 1 - ε and [formula].

For ε > 0, we let for u∈H10(Ω) and where P is the class of all continuous paths in H10(Ω) connecting 0 and some u0 such that [formula]. It is easy to see that c*ε  ≤  C for some constant C independent of ε. Since for ε > 0, [formula] satisfies the P-S condition, it is known that c*ε is a critical point of [formula], i.e., there exists a solution uε∈H10(Ω) with [formula]. Thus,

[formula]

From [\eqref=22equation], we have By noting both of [formula] and [formula] are positive, we have

[formula]

Therefore, by passing to a subsequence if necessary, we might assume [formula] in H10(Ω) as ε  →  0. If [formula], then u is a solution of

[formula]

However, the standard Pohozaev indentity yields that equation [\eqref=equationcritical] has no positive solutions because both of p1 and p2 are critical exponents. Thus [formula] and uε(x) must blow up as ε  →  0.

Before poceeding further, we will briefly discuss the regularity of u at 0. Because s1 < 2, we can prove that

[formula]

see [\cite=HLW].

Let By direct computations, we have

First, we claim

[formula]

Suppose not. By passing to a subsequence if necessary, we may assume By scaling, we set where By equation [\eqref=21equation], ṽε(y) satisfies Let Ωε  →  H as ε  →  0, where either [formula] or H is a closed half space of [formula]. Note [formula] and [formula] tend to 0 as ε  →  0. Then by applying elliptic estimates, ṽε converges to ṽ in C2loc(H), where If H is a half space of [formula], then v also satisfies v = 0 on ∂H. Since [formula], [formula] in H no matter H is [formula] or a half space. But it yields a contradiction to v(0) = 1. Thus, the claim is proved.

After [\eqref=firstclaim] is established, we set Then vε(y) satisfies where [formula]. Since [formula] is bounded, without loss of generality, we may assume [formula]. Therefore, Ωε  →  H as ε  →  0, where H is a half spae of [formula] with - y0∈∂H and by the elliptic estimates, vε(y)  →  v(y) in C2loc(H). Clearly, v satisfies

[formula]

Since v(0) = 1, we have y0  ≠  0. By a linear transformation of y, H can be map onto [formula] and v is an entire solution of equation [\eqref=1equation] with [formula]. This completes the proof of the existence part of Theorem [\ref=2theorem].

Remark. Suppose v is a positive entire soltion of [\eqref=1equation]. Then the Kelvin transformation [formula] is also a positive entire solution. By the regularity [\eqref=decayestimate], |(y)|  ≤  C|y| for |y|  <  1. Thus,

[formula]

By the standard gradient estimate, we have

[formula]

By using the well-known method of moving sphere, it can be proved that after a suitable scaling, v(y) = (y). Since the argument is standard now, the proof is omitted here.

There exists an entire solution v of equation [\eqref=1equation] with [formula] such that the critical value [formula].

We first note that

[formula]

because

[formula]

implies [formula] for some constant c0 > 0.

Suppose vj is a sequence of positive entire solutions of

[formula]

such that [formula]. By the remark above, we can assume j(y) = vj(y). By [\eqref=22equation] again, [formula] for some constant C > 0. Let [formula] in [formula]. If v  ≠  0, then

[formula]

Then it yields the conclusion of Corollary [\ref=21corollary].

If [formula], then [formula], because j(y) = vj(y) implies

[formula]

By the proof of Theorem [\ref=2theorem], we see that vj blows up at y = 0 and the scaling wj(y): where [formula], [formula], and w is also a positive entire solution of equation [\eqref=1equation]. Thus, which yields a contradiction. Hence, [formula], and Corollary [\ref=21corollary] is proved.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=1theorem]

Let v(y) be a least-energy solution of

[formula]

and

[formula]

Suppose that Ω is a bounded smooth domain in [formula] with 0∈∂Ω. If H(0) < 0, then there exists a nonnegative function [formula] such that

Without loss of generality, we may assume that in a neighborhood of 0, ∂Ω can be represented by xn  =  φ(x'), where [formula], φ(0) = 0, [formula], [formula], and the outer normal of ∂Ω at 0 is [formula]. Define We choose a small positive number r0 so that there exist neighborhoods of 0, U and Ũ, such that φ(U) = Br0(0), [formula], [formula] and [formula]. Here, we adopt the notation: Let η∈C∞0(U) be a positive cut-off function with [formula] in Ũ. Set For t  ≥  0, we have

[formula]

In what follows, we estimate each integral on the right-hand side of [\eqref=eachintest]. Basically, the computation will be similar to Lemma 2.2 in [\cite=CLW]. For the sake of completeness, we will sketch the proof here. We refer the readers to [\cite=CLW] for details of computation.

By the change of the variable [formula], we get

[formula]

By using integration by parts and equation [\eqref=eqentvy], the second term can be estimated as the following.

[formula]

Since ∂Ω is C2 at 0, φ can be expanded as Hence,

[formula]

where

[formula]

where and

[formula]

where By [\eqref=eqq3.8] and [\eqref=eqq3.9], Ki, i = 1,2,3, are finite. Therefore, we have and similarly, we have

[formula]

and Therfore,

[formula]

where Since 2*(s2) > 2*(s1), [formula] has the unique maximum. Note that Hence, the maximum of [formula] occurs at [formula]. By noting that and f2(1) = εH(0)K1(1 + o(1)) < 0. Hence, we have Thus Lemma [\ref=lem41critical] is proved.

We are now in a position to prove Theorem [\ref=1theorem]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=1theorem]. As before, we let for small positive ε,

[formula]

where p1(ε)  =  2*(s1) - 1 - ε and [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lem41critical], there exists u0∈H10(Ω) such that Φε(u0)  ≤  0 and

[formula]

where P is the class of all continuous paths in H10(Ω) connecting 0 with u0. Let c1 be the positive constant defined by [\eqref=eqqq4.2]. Then Lemma [\ref=lem41critical] yields

[formula]

provided that ε∈[null] for some small ε0 > 0. For ε > 0, there exists a solution uε∈H10(Ω) of

[formula]

and Φε(uε)  =  cε. Similar to [\eqref=22equation], we have

[formula]

for some constant C1 independent of ε. By passing to a subsequence if necessary, we may assume

[formula]

If [formula] 0, then clearly u is a solution of [\eqref=1equation] and Theorem [\ref=1theorem] is proved. So it remains to prove [formula] in Ω.

Suppose [formula]. As in Section 3, there exists xε∈Ω such that

[formula]

and after a linear transformation on y, we have

[formula]

where [formula] and v satisfies

[formula]

Also by a direct computation, we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

By [\eqref=22equation], we have

[formula]

Thus, [\eqref=eqq4.5] and [\eqref=eqq4.6] yields

[formula]

which contradicts to [\eqref=eqq4.4]. Hence, [formula], and then Theorem [\ref=1theorem] is proved.

The Case s2 = 0

As discussed in Introduction, equation [\eqref=1equation] with λ < 0 has no least-energy solutions. In this sectin, we will consider a perturbed equation from equation [\eqref=1equation]:

[formula]

Suppose [formula] and N  ≥  4. Then equation [\eqref=41equation] has a positive solution.

Let Choose 0  ≠  x0∈Ω and for large μ > 0, where φ(x) is a cut-off function near x0. Then it is not difficult to show that provided that [formula] and μ is sufficiently large. Let u0 = t0vμ, and where P is the class of continuous paths in H10(Ω) connecting 0 and u0. Then it is easy to see

[formula]

We claim: c* is a critical value for [formula]. By the deformation lemma (see lemma in [\cite=]), there exists uj∈H10(Ω) such that

[formula]

where o(1)  →  0 as j  →    +    ∞  . By [\eqref=42equation] and [\eqref=43equation], we have for some constant C independent of j. By passing to a subsequence if necessary, we assume If u  ≠  0, then it is easy to see u is a solution of [\eqref=41equation] and [formula]. Hence, it remains to show that [formula]. We prove it by contradiction.

Now suppose [formula], and set Then [\eqref=43equation] implies

[formula]

and

[formula]

By the Sobolev inequality, [\eqref=46equation] implies Thus, we have Then [\eqref=45equation] yields a contradiction to [\eqref=42equation]. Hence, Theorem [\ref=41thm] is proved.
