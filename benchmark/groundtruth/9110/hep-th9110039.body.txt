COSETS AS GAUGE SLICES IN SU(1,1) STRINGS STEPHEN HWANG Institute of Theoretical Physics S-412 96 Göteborg, Sweden E-mail: tfesh@secthf51 ABSTRACT

We consider a string theory based on an SU(1,1) Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten model and an arbitrary unitary conformal field theory. We show that the solutions of the Virasoro conditions, in the unitarity regime of the SU(1,1) theory, are states which lie in the Euclidean coset SU(1,1) / U(1). This shows the validity, at the quantum level, of a time-like type of gauge in these models.

There has recently been a substantial interest in Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten models (WZNW) based on non-compact Lie groups, in particular, the simplest one with an SU(1,1) symmetry. There are currently two principal fields of investigations. In one of them, the SU(1,1) WZNW theory is considered as a string theory with the time direction being one of the coordinates (the compact one) of the SU(1,1) manifold [\cite=BALOG]-[\cite=HHRS]. These string theories have many interesting properties and they have been proved to be unitary in the bosonic case [\cite=HWANG] and in the N = 1 fermionic case [\cite=HH]. In addition they can be made modular invariant [\cite=HHRS] [\cite=HHRS2] by introducing new sectors of states, so called "non-Abelian" winding sectors.

The other field of investigation has been focusing on taking cosets of the SU(1,1) WZNW model [\cite=LYKKEN]-[\cite=DISTLER]. The resulting theories have attracted particularly much attention due to the connection with black holes in two dimensions and the Liouville theory [\cite=WITTEN]. In this note we will show a close connection between the first approach and the latter one for the Euclidean coset. By imposing conformal invariance of the complete SU(1,1) theory coupled to an arbitrary unitary conformal field theory (UCFT), we will show that the resulting physical state space will automatically also satisfy the Euclidean coset condition, when we restrict ourselves to the representations which have been proved to be unitary for the SU(1,1) string theory [\cite=HWANG]. Therefore, in these cases the physical properties of the SU(1,1) string theories are basically those of the coset. This does not mean that the two theories are equivalent. A string theory based on the coset coupled with a UCFT will have a mass shell condition L0 - 1 = 0, which depends on the eigenvalue of J30, the global generator in the compact direction. This is important, since it is this dependence, which makes L0 of the coset have only positive eigenvalues in the unitarity region. Therefore, the mass-shell condition will only allow ground states. This is in contrast to the full SU(1,1) theory, which has, in general, many possible excitation levels. Outside the unitarity region, however, the coset model may exhibit a richer structure.

Our results here also include an alternative and more direct proof of unitarity of the SU(1,1) string theory than the one given in ref.[\cite=HWANG]. It is more suitable for generalizations to constructions using other non-compact groups.

Let L(0)n be the SU(1,1) Virasoro generators

[formula]

The total Virasoro generators are given by [formula] where [formula] represent any UCFT. Here the current modes Jan, a = 1,2,3, satisfy the affine sû(1,1) algebra

[formula]

with gab = diag( - 1, - 1,1) (see [\cite=HWANG] for further conventions). We will also define the Virasoro generators of the SU(1,1) / U(1) coset, [formula]. This coset is defined by the requirement that J3n,n > 0, annihilates states. Ln satisfy the Virasoro algebra with conformal anomaly [formula], where [formula] is the conformal anomaly of [formula]. We will here always assume the critical value c = 26 and x <  - 2, so that for the conformal anomaly of the SU(1,1) theory, c(0) > 3. Physical states will satisfy

[formula]

Let us now investigate these equations closer and show that in addition to the Virasoro conditions, the states |ψ〉 will automatically satisfy further conditions. We will first show the following property (I): The following states

[formula]

are all linearly independent, when [formula]. Here Ln|t;h,m〉 = J3n|t;h,m〉 = 0, ~ n > 0, and h and m are the eigenvalues of L0 and J30, respectively. D̃Nvir(h̃) is the determinant at level N of the n-module ([formula]) over a highest weight h̃.

To show this we first note that by using [formula], we can eliminate all factors of Ln in eq. [\ref=iv] in favour of n. Then we consider the matrix

[formula]

If this matrix has a non-vanishing determinant (for 〈t|t〉  ≠  0) then we have proved the linear independence of the states in eq. [\ref=iv]. This determinant is, however, easily calculated since J3n and n commute. It is, therefore, given as a product of three factors. One from the tranverse space, |t〉, the second one from the U(1) space spanned by J3n and thirdly determinants of the n-modules up to level N with a highest weight of dimension [formula]. The first two factors are non-zero and, therefore, the zeros of the det M come from the third factor.This last factor is non-zero if the determinant of the Verma module at level N is non-zero and then the linear independence holds.

We can now use results established in the old proof of the no-ghost theorem of the bosonic string [\cite=GODDARD]. We have the following property (II): All spurious states, i.e.  states of the form L- n|χ〉,n > 0, which are on-shell, are mapped to spurious states under the action of Ln,n > 0, if c = 26. The space of non-spurious states is invariant under the action of Ln,n  ≥  0. We will not prove the statement here, but refer to the original proof in [\cite=GODDARD]. With the basis eq. [\ref=iv] we write a general on-shell state |ψ〉 as |ψ〉 = |φ〉 + |s〉, where |s〉 is a spurious state. Then by property II, we find that the equation Ln|ψ〉 = 0,n > 0, implies that Ln|φ〉 = Ln|s〉 = 0,n > 0. The first of these equations will imply, by using [formula], that [formula], n > 0. Consequently we must have |φ〉 = |t〉, so that the general solution to eq. [\ref=iii] will be |ψ〉 = |t〉 + |s〉. The spurious states are null and the relevant part of the physical state space is given by the transverse space |t〉. These states satisfy the additional condition that they are annihilated by J3n,n > 0.

We must now investigate under what circumstances the Kac-determinant of n will be non-zero. For the continous unitary representations the situation is quite trivial, since the mass-shell condition will not allow any excitations beyond the groundstates. Let us, therefore, consider the discrete representations. The eigenvalues of 0, h̃, are of the form [formula], where N is the level of the state and [formula] the ground-state eigenvalue of [formula] ([formula] from unitarity). We can rewrite this as

[formula]

For the discrete representations D±j we have j < 0 and j  ±  m  ≥  0, so that h̃ > 0 for [formula]. From the form of the Kac-determinant it is known that for the values of [formula] considered here, 2 <   ≤  25 there will be no zeros for positive highest weights. This means that there will be no zeros for [formula]. Outside this region there will exist null-states, the first one for [formula]: [formula]. The states for which [formula] are precisely those which have been proved to be unitary for the coset [\cite=DIXON] and, consequently, we must also have unitarity for the full SU(1,1) string in this regime. We can summarize our results in the following

Theorem. The solutions of the Virasoro conditions, with [formula] for the discrete representations, will be unitary states |φ〉, which are determined up to null-states and will satisfy

[formula]

One should compare this result with the proof of the no-ghost theorem given previously [\cite=HWANG]. In that proof one uses the light-like combination Kn = k  ·  Jn instead of J3n, where ka is light-like SU(1,1) vector. It is then established that physical states will be annihilated by positive modes of Kn provided the eigenvalues of K0 are non-zero, irrespective of the value of j. This means that the non-unitary representations will also be possible. In the case of the time-like coset with J3n, unitarity appears to be manifest. One should bear in mind, however, that the techniques used above only provide sufficient conditions. It may still be that the physical states satisfy the coset conditions even for representations which can have zeros in the Kac determinant.

A simple application of the methods used above, is the ordinary bosonic string in d-dimensional Minkowski space coupled to an arbitrary UCFT. We can copy the analysis using now the Virasoro generators [formula] and in place of J3n we use α0n. Then, if the determinant of the corresponding Verma module is non-zero, the physical states will satisfy α0n|φ〉 = 0,n > 0. The eigenvalues of 0 are strictly positive except when all of the space-like components of the momentum pi, [formula], are zero. But, by Lorentz invariance, we can, at any mass level, choose a frame for which pi  ≠  0, unless [formula] or d < 2. Consequently, for strings in dimensions 2  ≤  d  ≤  26 and non-zero momentum we will have no Virasoro null states and the time-like condition is implied. The unitarity of the physical subspace is then manifest. This means that the time-like gauge is possible for the quantum theory for 2  ≤  d  ≤  26.

As we have mentioned, there exists another coset space, which is possible as a solution to the Virasoro conditions. This space was specified by the light-like combination Kn = J1n + J3n. The coset arises if we choose to work with ground-states which are diagonalized with respect K0. In the covariant quantization it is, therefore, essentiallly the choice of the basis of the ground-states which determines which gauge-slice we are to find. An interesting question is what happens if we take the ground states in a basis which is diagonal with respect to one of the non-compact generators e.g.  J20. The natural coset would then be defined by modding out J2n and corresponds to the Minkowskian version of the black hole in ref.[\cite=WITTEN]. In this case we have [formula], [formula]. The important difference here, as compared with the compact case, is that the eigenvalues of 0 are now of the form [formula] (λ is the eigenvalue of J20, which is real for the unitary representations). These values are in general both positive and negative and consequently our techniques can not be used to show that this coset is contained in the Virasoro conditions. This is an indication that the coset is not a good gauge slice. It is perhaps not surprising. In the limit of a flat manifold, the coset would correspond to a gauge in which we fix one of the space-like components of αμn. This is classically not an acceptable gauge. One may also check explicitely, that the solutions to the Virasoro conditions at level two do not satisfy the space-like coset condition, so that the coset is not a permissable gauge at the quantum level, either. If this is still true for non-zero curvature, then the question is in which coset the physical states lie. Such a coset must exist, since by gauge invariance the dimensionality of the physical state space is such that it admits subsidiary gauge conditions.
