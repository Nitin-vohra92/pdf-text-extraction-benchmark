The clustering of polarity reversals of the geomagnetic field

Local paleomagnetic measurements of the geomagnetic field [\cite=generale] [\cite=core] [\cite=CK95] reveal a sequence of sudden and occasional global polarity reversals in the last 160 million years. The magnetic dipole typically reverses its direction in a few 103 years, while the time intervals between successive reversals range from 104 up to 107 years [\cite=generale] [\cite=CK95] [\cite=valet93]. Even though polarity reversals can be ascribed to the Earth's magnetic dynamo [\cite=generale] [\cite=review] [\cite=dynamo] [\cite=stefani05], details of the mechanism remain poorly understood. The debate on the origin of reversals, the modeling of the trigger (external or internal to Earth) and the generation of longer variations in the average reversal rate is still open (cfr. e.g. Ref.s [\cite=core] [\cite=yamazaki]). A look at the sequence of reversals, for example the most used CK95 database [\cite=CK95], reproduced in fig. [\ref=fig1], shows that polarity reversals seem to be the result of a non-periodic chaotic (or stochastic) process. Actually non regular reversals can be observed in the framework of purely deterministic toy models that mimic the dynamics of the dynamo effect with only few modes [\cite=rikitake] [\cite=crossley] [\cite=turcotte], in the framework of noise-induced switchings between two metastable states [\cite=schmitt] [\cite=hoyng02] [\cite=hoyng04] or in mean-field dynamo with a noise-perturbed α profile [\cite=giesecke] [\cite=stefani05]. In principle geodynamo is described by 3D global Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) that self-consistently solve for the fluid flow, thermodynamics and magnetic fields with all nonlinear feedbacks (for a review see Ref. [\cite=review] and references therein, and the results of the recent 15.2 TFlops simulation of geodynamo on the Earth Simulator [\cite=earth]). Although some numerical codes have simulated short series of spontaneous reversals, none have been run so far at high enough resolution to be confident that the critical dynamics is being captured in the simulation.

In spite of the paucity of data sets, it is commonly assumed that the phenomenon of reversals stems from an underlying Poisson process. This conjecture is based on the fact that the polarity persistence times Δt, defined as the time intervals between two consecutive reversals Δt  =  ti + 1 - ti, seem to be exponentially distributed [\cite=generale] [\cite=mcfadden] [\cite=hoyng02] [\cite=constable], namely P(Δt)  ~  λ exp ( - λΔt) where λ represents the rate of occurrence of reversals. Different analyses (cfr. e.g Ref. [\cite=jonkers]) state that the frequency distribution of intervals between Cenozoic geomagnetic reversals approximate a power law for large Δt. Even a rough look at the probability distribution function P(Δt) (cfr. fig [\ref=fig1]) shows that the situation is not clear, mainly in presence of a poor data set with high statistical errors.

Recently Constable [\cite=constable] raised two main statistical features to the attention of the scientific community, namely: i) the distribution of events shows a paucity of short intervals; ii) the rate of occurrence of events is time-dependent λ  =  λ(t). The author investigated the temporal distribution of λ(t), showing that a Poisson model with a monotonic rate, either increasing or decreasing, is not a good model for the reversal process. On the contrary, reversals could be perhaps modeled as a renewal Poisson process with a rate that must change sign at some interval before 158 My [\cite=constable]. In any case, modeling λ(t) over the entire time interval is not an easy task (cfr. also Ref.s [\cite=altripoisson] [\cite=mcfadden]). Moreover, in this situation, namely when the rate λ depends on time, the distribution of persistence times remains without physical meaning and cannot be used to determine the Poisson character of events [\cite=feller].

The problem is perhaps more general than what we present here, because abrupt flow reversals have been found also in the large-scale circulation during turbulent Rayleigh-Benard convection [\cite=benzi], or in the wind direction in atmosphere [\cite=atmosfera]. The conjecture that reversals are Poisson events is made in all cases. Here, starting from the above experimental evidences, and using a simple statistical test on some databases, we will investigate whether a conjecture based on the occurrence of a Poisson process for reversals is correct or not. We will show that this is not the case, and that geomagnetic reversals are clustered in time, a result which stems from the presence of memory in the process generating polarity reversals.

Under the experimental evidence that the rate of reversals is not constant, we can test, as a zero-th order hypothesis, wheter an approach based on the occurrence of a Local Poisson Process is correct or not. In other word, according to Constable [\cite=constable] it can be conjectured that (hypothesis H0), even if it cannot be decide wheter globally the reversals stem from a Poisson process, an underlying time-varying Poisson process could be assumed to originate the geomagnetic reversals. Since the reversals rate λ(t) is not known, we have to build up a test which is independent on the rate λ. This can be done through a measure used previously in the framework of solar flares [\cite=boffetta] [\cite=lepreti]. We introduce a statistical quantity that is nothing but the suitably normalized local time interval between reversals. Let us consider the time sequence of reversals as a point-like process and suppose that each reversal occurs at the discrete time ti. Let δti  =   min {ti + 1 - ti;ti - ti - 1} and let τi be either τi  =  ti - 1 - ti - 2 (if δti  =  ti - ti - 1) or τi  =  ti + 2 - ti + 1 (if δti  =  ti + 1 - ti), so that δti and τi are the two persistence times following or preceeding a given reversal at ti. If the local Poisson hypothesis H0 holds, both δti and τi are independently distributed according to an exponential probability density: p(δt)  =  2λi exp ( - 2λiδt) and p(τ) = λi exp ( - λiτ) with local rate λi. Then, under the hypothesis H0, the stochastic variable H, defined as
