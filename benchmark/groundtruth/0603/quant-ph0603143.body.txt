Generating set for general multipartite entangled states

Introduction

Quantification and classification of multipartite quantum entangled states is an ongoing research activity in the emerging field of quantum information and quantum computation [\cite=Lewen00] [\cite=Hor00] [\cite=Bennett96a] [\cite=Dur00] [\cite=Eisert01] [\cite=Pan] [\cite=Verst] [\cite=Miyake]. There are several well-known entanglement measures for bipartite states and among these entanglement measures the concurrence [\cite=Wootters98] is widely known. Recently, there have been some proposals to generalize this measure to general bipartite and multipartite states [\cite=Uhlmann00] [\cite=Gerjuoy] [\cite=Albeverio] [\cite=Mintert]. We have also defined concurrence classes for multi-qubit mixed states and for general pure multipartite states based on an orthogonal complement of a positive operator valued measure ( POVM) on quantum phase [\cite=Hosh5] [\cite=Hosh6]. In this paper, we propose a minimal entanglement generating set (MEGS) for a general multipartite state based on our concurrence and it's generating operators [\cite=Hosh7]. In particular, in section [\ref=povm] we give short introduction our POVM and the construction of the operators that generate the concurrence for general multipartite states. In section [\ref=megs] we will define a minimal entanglement generating set for multipartite states and we will also give some example our construction for bi-, three-, and four-partite states.

We will denote a general, composite quantum system with m subsystems as [formula] with th pure state

[formula]

and corresponding Hilbert space [formula] where the dimension of the jth Hilbert space is given by Nj  =   dim (HQj). In order to simplify our presentation, we will use Λm = k1,l1; [formula] as an abstract multi-index notation.

Construction of concurrence for general multipartite states

In this section we give a short review of our POVM and the construction of concurrence for general multipartite states based on orthogonal complement of these operators. A general and symmetric POVM in a single Nj-dimensional Hilbert space HQj is given by

[formula]

where |kj〉 and |lj〉 are the basis vectors in HQj and the quantum phases satisfy the following relation φkj,lj  =    -  φlj,kj(1 - δkjlj). The POVM is a function of the Nj(Nj - 1) / 2 phases [formula]. Moreover, our POVM is self-adjoint, positive, and normalized. In following text we will use the short notation [formula] for our POVM. It is now possible to form a POVM of a multipartite system by simply forming the tensor product

[formula]

where, e.g., φk1,l1 is the set of POVMs phase associated with subsystems Q1, for all [formula]. In the m-partite case, the off-diagonal elements of the matrix corresponding to

[formula]

where the orthogonal complement of our POVM is defined by [formula]. INj is the Nj-by-Nj identity matrix for subsystem j.

[formula] has phases that are sums or differences of phases originating from [formula] subsystems. That is, in the latter case the phases of [formula] take the form [formula] and identification of these joint phases makes our distinguishing possible. Thus, we can define linear operators for the [formula] class which are sums and differences of phases of two subsystems, i.e., (φkr1,lr1  ±  φkr2,lr2). That is, for the [formula] class we have

[formula]

where [formula] for all [formula]. Next, we rewrite the linear operator [formula] as a direct sum of the upper and lower anti-diagonal

[formula]

The set of linear operators for the [formula] classes gives the [formula] class concurrence. The next class we will consider is what we call the [formula] class which given by

[formula]

where by choosing φπkj,lj  =  π for all [formula], we get an operator which has the structure of the Pauli operator σx embedded in a higher-dimensional Hilbert space and coincides with σx for a single-qubit. Next, we write the linear operators for the [formula] class as

[formula]

where the operators [formula] are constructed by pairing of elements of the POVM with sums and differences of quantum phases. We can also define the [formula] class operator

[formula]

where [formula]. In the same way we can construct all other operators in these classes. Now, by taking the expectation value of each of these classes of operators, we are able to construct the concurrence for general multipartite states [\cite=Hosh7]. In the next section we will propose a minimal entanglement generating set for general multipartite states based on our construction of the concurrence.

Minimal entanglement generating set for multipartite states

As we have shown there are different classes of operators that generates concurrence for general multipartite states. So, the construction of a measures of entanglement for general multipartite states suggests that there exists different classes of entanglement that contributes to the degree entanglement. These different classes of entanglement are detected by [formula] and [formula] classes of operators. Thus, we can propose a [formula] for general multipartite states based on this construction of the concurrence as follows

[formula]

where for m-partite states we have [formula] [formula] classes and C(m,k)  [formula] classes, for 2 < k  ≤  m. For example the minimal entanglement generating set for bipartite states has only one element, that is [formula]. This is exactly what we have expect to see. For three-partite states the MEGS has C(3,2) = 3 EPR elements and C(3,3) = 1 [formula] element

[formula]

Note also that the combinations of EPR elements gives the W class entanglement. Our last example is the MEGS for four-partite states which is given by

[formula]

This set has C(4,2) = 6 EPR elements, C(4,3) = 4 [formula] elements, and C(4,4) = 1 [formula] element. Note that, for each element of EPR class there is only one operator that correspond to a given element of the MEGS. But for each element of GHZ classes there are a set of operators that correspond to a given element of the MEGS. The elements of MEGS are inequivalent under local quantum operations and classical communication by construction an in the case of three-partite states and in general between [formula] and [formula] classes. The MEGS set is not equivalent to minimal reversible entanglement generating set, but there is some similarity between these two sets. Thus the MEGS set gives information about the nature of multipartite entangled states in a time where there is no well known and accepted classification of multipartite states available.
