Sharp Spectral Asymptotics for 2-dimensional Schrödinger operator with a strong magnetic field. Note about forgotten generic case

consider magnetic Schrödinger operator in dimension d = 2 assuming that coefficients are smooth and magnetic field is non-degenerating. Then I extend the remainder estimate O(μ- 1h- 1 + 1) derived in [\cite=Ivr1] for the case when V / F has no stationary points to the case when it has non-degenerating stationary points. If some of them are saddles and μ3h  ≥  2 then asymptotics contains correction terms of magnitude μ- 1h- 1| log μ3h|.

Introduction

I consider spectral asymptotics of the magnetic Schrödinger operator

[formula]

where gjk, Vj, V are smooth real-valued functions of [formula] and (gjk) is positive-definite matrix, 0 < h  ≪  1 is a Planck parameter and [formula] is a coupling parameter. I assume that A is a self-adjoint operator and all the conditions are satisfied in the ball B(0,1).

In contrast to my recent papers [\cite=IRO3] [\cite=IRO4] [\cite=IRO5] I assume that all the coefficients are very smooth; in contrast to [\cite=IRO4] I consider only two-dimensional case here and in contrast to [\cite=IRO6] I assume that magnetic field is non-degenerate. So I am completely in frames of section 6 [\cite=Ivr1] where I just forgot to consider the case of V / F having non-degenerating stationary points. My analysis will be sketchy, more details I will publish in the future. Thus this note together with Chapter 6 of [\cite=Ivr1] and with [\cite=IRO6] completely covers generic 2-dimensional smooth case. One can generalize these results to non-smooth case using approach of [\cite=IRO3].

Let g =  det (gjk)- 1, F12  =  ∂x1V2  -  ∂x2V1 and [formula] which is a scalar intensity of the magnetic field, [formula]. I assume that both V and F are disjoint from 0:

[formula]

In this note I am going to consider the case when V / F has non-degenerate critical points and I will recover the same asymptotics and remainder estimate as either [formula] or V / F has no saddle points in the domain in question and there will be correction terms of magnitude μ- 1h- 1| log (μ3h)| associated with saddle points as [formula].

I am interested in asymptotics of [formula] as μ  →    +    ∞  , h  →   + 0 where e(x,y,τ) is the Schwartz kernel of the spectral projector of A and [formula].

Let operator A defined by () with real-valued gjk,Vj,V be self-adjoint in L2(X). Further gjk,Vj,V,ψ be smooth enough in B(0,1) and conditions () - () be fulfilled and there, let B(0,1)  ⊂  X. Finally, let all critical points of V / F in B(0,1) be non-degenerate. Then

(i) As [formula] the standard asymptotics holds (i.e. () - () without correction terms);

(ii) As [formula] the following asymptotics holds

[formula]

with summation over all saddle points xj of V / F where

[formula]

is magnetic Weyl expression, and

[formula]

where

[formula]

and κ is defined by (); further, as C(h| log h|)- 1  ≤  μ  ≤  εh- 1 one must include in [formula]

[formula]

again associated with saddle points.

Let operator A defined by () with real-valued gjk,Vj,V be self-adjoint in L2(X). Further gjk,Vj,V,ψ be smooth enough in B(0,1) and conditions (),() be fulfilled and there, let B(0,1)  ⊂  X. Further, let εh- 1  ≤  μ and V =  - (2n̄ + 1)μhF + W with smooth bounded W. Finally, let each critical point of W / F in B(0,1) be either non-degenerate or satisfy |W|  ≥  ε0. Then asymptotics () holds with extra correction term [formula] as μ  ≤  Ch- 3| log h|- 1; for larger μ correction term contains also more complicated O(μh3| log h|) terms.

One can drop condition ([\ref=3]) by rescaling arguments after main theorem [\ref=thm-1] is established.

Ideas of the proof: weak magnetic field case

As μ  ≤  h- 1 + δ in zone [formula] one can apply weak magnetic field approach (see section 6.3 of [\cite=Ivr1]) and derive remainder estimate O(μ- 1h- 1  +  ρ2μh- 1); furthermore, with logarithmic uncertainty principle replacing the standard microlocal uncertainty principle (see [\cite=IRO1] [\cite=IRO3]) one can derive this remainder estimate with [formula]. This leads to the proof of the standard asymptotics with the remainder estimate O(μ- 1h- 1) as [formula].

Furthermore, based on the canonical form ([\ref=10]) (see next section) one can prove the same asymptotics and the remainder estimate with [formula] and therefore achieve remainder estimate O(μ- 1h- 1) as [formula], thus proving Theorem [\ref=thm-1](i).

Ideas of the proof: intermediate and strong magnetic field cases

To prove Theorem [\ref=thm-1](ii) and calculate correction term let me remind that according to section 6.4 of [\cite=Ivr1] one can reduce microlocally operator ([\ref=1]) to the canonical form

[formula]

Then replacing harmonic oscillator [formula] by its eigenvalues (2n + 1)μh ([formula]) one arrives to the family of 1-dimensional [formula]-pdos [formula] with symbols which modulo [formula] are [formula] where [formula] is a map with | det DΨ| = F- 1.

Since I am interested in the energy level 0, I am most interested in the operator An which is not elliptic in the point in question i.e. in operator with n = n̄ delivering minimum to |V + (2n + 1)μhF| (which I have already denoted by σ).

Furthermore, according to formula (6.6.24) of [\cite=Ivr1] symbol of An with n = n̄ is equal modulo O(μ- 4 + h2) to

[formula]

where κ and L are scalar curvature and the Laplace-Beltrami operator associated with the metric F- 1gjk.

Then according to the theory of 1-dimensional operators the standard Weyl spectral asymptotics holds for each of them with the remainder estimate O(1) and thus the remainder estimate for the original problem is [formula]; however the principal part of such asymptotics includes the full symbol of operator, including terms of magnitude μ- 2 and h- 2; however as [formula] one can skip terms O(μ- 4) and O(μ- 2h2) in An without penalty; further, as μ  ≤  C(h| log h|)- 1 one can skip terms O(h2) in An without penalty as well.

However to preserve remainder estimate one must compensate skipping O(μ- 2) terms in An by the corresponding correction term and one can see easily that this correction term is equal to κ0μ- 2h- 2 plus the correction term associated with 1-dimensional operator

[formula]

in zone [formula] where and k,w,σ,ω1 are calculated in the critical point in question; this latter correction term is [formula] for saddle points and [formula] for maxima and minima and therefore only saddle points should be considered (i.e. critical points with [formula]).

Since this asymptotics should be consistent with one obtained by weak magnetic field approach κ0 = 0 and the correction term in question is associated with perturbation μ- 2k- 1ω1 in zone |x2| + |ξ2|  ≤  ρ} and thus modulo O(μ- 1h- 1) it is which can be rewritten in ([\ref=7]) with

[formula]

calculated at this point.

Actually, this is correct only as μ  ≤  C(h| log h|)- 1; for C(h| log h|)- 1  ≤  μ  ≤  Ch- 1 one should not discard an extra term ωh2 in An but this term will contribute above O(μ- 1h- 1) only as n = n̄ and it generates [formula]. This leads to the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm-1](ii).

Ideas of the proof: superstrong magnetic field case

As μ  ≥  εh- 1 the same approach works but now only a single n = n̄ produces non-trivial contribution while contribution of every n < n̄ is [formula] and contribution of every n > n̄ is 0 (modulo negligible terms). So one should just repeat the same analysis where now ρ  =  ε. One should not discard ωh2 in An even if there are no critical points and this term produces extra correction term. This leads to the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm-2].
