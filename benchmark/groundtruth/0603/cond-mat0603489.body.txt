Comment on "Pairing and Phase Separation in a Polarized Fermi Gas" by G. B. Partridge, W. Li, R. I. Kamar, Y. Liao, R. G. Hulet, Science 311, 503 (2006)

The authors of [\cite=part06phase] report the observation of a quantum phase transition in a strongly interacting Fermi gas with imbalanced spin populations. Below a critical population imbalance, the paper claims evidence for a homogeneous superfluid state with unequal densities. Above the critical population, it reports the observation of a core of superfluid pairs surrounded by a shell of excess spin-up atoms. In this comment we argue that (a) the data presented in  [\cite=part06phase] do not allow to unambiguously distinguish phase-separated from non phase-separated clouds, and superfluid from normal clouds, (b) the paper does not provide evidence for a quantum phase transition and (c) that the claim of a quantum phase transition at small polarization and of phase-separation and superfluidity at large polarization are inconsistent with more detailed recent experiments.

It appears that the analysis in [\cite=part06phase] was carried out without awareness that after double integration, a shell structure does not lead to a density profile with two peaks at the edges, but to a flat top-hat distribution since the density profile of a thin hollow sphere after two integrations is flat. This was already emphasized by [\cite=desi06dens], who showed that any spin distribution confined in a harmonic trap (with [formula] and assuming local density approximation, LDA) results in flat [\cite=haqu06dens] or monotonically decreasing difference profiles. The single peak structures found by the authors of [\cite=part06phase] at small population imbalances are thus the expected outcome for any state of the gas, including phase-separated states.

Therefore, a question raised by the experiment of [\cite=part06phase] is the origin of the double peak structures. The double peaks require a breakdown of either the LDA (sometimes called finite size effects) or the harmonic approximation. Since the LDA was generally expected to be valid for Fermi energies much greater than the energy level spacing of the trap, we argued in the first version of this comment that anharmonicities were a plausible explanation [\cite=zwie06_comment], given that anharmonicities were not controlled or specified in the original paper. However, in response to this comment, the Rice group has characterized their trapping potential [\cite=rice_reply], and this possible interpretation of their original data has now been ruled out. Still, we want to point out (see Ref. [\cite=zwie06_comment]) that anharmonicities are of general importance for Fermi gas experiments. These are usually carried out in traps with trap depths comparable to the Fermi energy. Therefore, anharmonicities have to be taken into account for any quantitative interpretation of density profiles and accurate determination of interaction energies from cloud sizes.

To demonstrate phase separation, i.e. the presence of a fully paired core surrounded by a shell of excess atoms, one needs to show that the density difference of the two components abruptly changes from zero in the superfluid core to a finite value in the normal state. This requires stronger evidence than doubly integrated density profiles, for example a tomographic reconstruction of the three-dimensional density or a careful comparison with simulated profiles. In particular, it is necessary to distinguish between partial and full expulsion of the unpaired majority atoms, which was not done in [\cite=part06phase] [\cite=zwie05imbalance], but subsequently in  [\cite=shin06_prl]. Mathematically, it is only possible to invert one-dimensional profiles and reconstruct the 3D density, if anharmonicities and deviations from the LDA are either absent or fully characterized. Given the breakdown of the LDA in the data of [\cite=part06phase], it is mathematically impossible to infer whether their profiles represent phase-separated clouds or only distorted clouds. Therefore, our recent observation of the absence of phase separation at large population imbalances [\cite=shin06_prl] is not inconsistent with the Rice data, but inconsistent only with their interpretation.

A breakdown of the LDA may be accentuated by phase separation, but cannot be used as strong evidence for it. For example, a non-interacting Bose-Einstein condensate strongly violates the LDA, and if it coexists with an interacting Bose-Einstein condensate, the difference profile may show double peaks without any interactions between the condensates. The cross-over observed in [\cite=part06phase] from single peak to double peak profiles may indicate an increasing importance of LDA violation, but does not provide evidence for a quantum phase transition. Indeed, recent more detailed experiments [\cite=shin06_prl] have observed shell structures at small imbalances and seem to rule out the quantum phase transition claimed by [\cite=part06phase].

Distorted density profiles do not imply superfluidity. Strongly interacting Fermi gases already show distorted profiles in the normal phase [\cite=zwie06_nature] [\cite=shin06_prl]. It is only the observation of an abrupt change as a function of temperature that can indicate superfluidity and allows to distinguish distortions due to superfluidity from those due to interactions present already in the normal phase. No abrupt changes in the density profiles as a function of temperature were reported in [\cite=part06phase]. It was recently found that a density change at the phase transition occurs only as a small feature in the clouds' center [\cite=zwie06_nature] [\cite=shin06_prl]. The fact, that [\cite=part06phase] missed the phase transition from a superfluid to a normal state at an imbalance around 0.75, which has been seen now with three different methods [\cite=zwie05imbalance] [\cite=zwie06_nature] [\cite=shin06_prl], implies that the observations in Ref. [\cite=part06phase] are either not sensitive to superfluidity or that the behavior of their sample is dominated by finite size effects. Ref. [\cite=part06phase] emphasizes the good agreement of the cloud size with theoretical predictions as evidence for superfluidity (through the so-called beta factor), but the cloud size is not expected to vary strongly as the temperature is increased above the phase transition temperature. For an imbalanced mixture, this was shown in [\cite=zwie06_nature].

In conclusion, Ref. [\cite=part06phase] reports interesting results about interaction-induced redistributions of atoms which have been linked to the breakdown of the LDA. However, the claims of the observation of pairing [\cite=part06phase], the observation of a superfluid core surrounded by a shell of excess spin-up atoms [\cite=part06phase] [\cite=press_release], the observation of a quantum phase transition [\cite=part06phase] [\cite=rice_reply], and speculations about a new exotic form of pairing [\cite=part06phase] [\cite=press_release] are not supported by the data.
