On Thermodynamics of Rational Maps on the Riemann sphere

Introduction

Let [formula] be a rational map of degree d  ≥  2. The Riemann sphere [formula] is endowed with the Fubini-Study form ω, normalized by [formula]. It is well-known that the sequence d- nfn *(ω) converges weakly to a probability measure μ which is totally invariant : d- 1f*(μ) = f*μ  =  μ, mixing, and which maximizes the entropy. This is the equilibrium measure of f. See Lyubich [\cite=ly] or [\cite=si] [\cite=ds2] [\cite=ds1] for the multidimensional analogue.

The classical Birkhoff ergodic theorem implies that if φ is a μ-integrable function then the Birkhoff sum [formula] converges μ-almost everywhere (μ-a.e. for short) to μ(φ). Assume that μ(φ) = 0. Then, the Birkhoff sum converges μ-a.e to 0.

Recall that φ is a coboundary if there exists a function ψ∈L2(μ) such that [formula] One easily checks that for such a function [formula] converges to 0 μ-almost surely. We say that a real-valued function φ∈L1(μ) satisfies the Central Limit Theorem (CLT for short) if [formula] converges in law to a Gaussian random variable of zero mean and variance σ > 0. That is, for every interval [formula] Such a function is not a coboundary.

Let Λ denote the adjoint of f* acting on L2(μ). Sometimes, Λ is called the Perron-Frobenius operator. We have

[formula]

Consider a real-valued function φ∈L∞(μ) such that μ(φ) = 0, which is not a coboundary. A classical theorem of Gordin-Liverani [\cite=go] [\cite=li] implies that if

[formula]

then φ satisfies the CLT with

When φ is smooth, condition ([\ref=eq_gordin]) is a direct consequence of the exponential decay of correlations proved by Fornæ ss and the third named author in [\cite=fs]. The case of Hölder continuous observables follows by interpolation between Banach spaces [\cite=do] [\cite=ds1], see also [\cite=ds2] [\cite=ds3] for the case of meromorphic maps in higher dimension. Note that with a completely different method (analysis of inverse branches) Haydn [\cite=ha] has proved the exponential decay of correlations, hence the CLT, for Gibbs measures. A weaker result was previously proved by Denker, Przytycki and Urbaski [\cite=de].

In this work, we study the speed of convergence in the CLT and prove the Local CLT. The approach is spectral theory for pertubation of the Perron-Frobenius operator Λ in appropriate Sobolev spaces. We follow the Nagaev method [\cite=na], which was used by Rousseau-Egèle [\cite=re] and Broise [\cite=br]. The main point here is to prove some necessary estimates in order to apply the Nagaev method. It turns out that the analogous estimates in the higher dimension case are more difficult. We also use a version of the classical result of Ionescu Tulcea and Marinescu.

We close this introduction with a brief outline of the paper to follow. In Section 2 we collect some background on Sobolev spaces. In Section 3 we develop the method of spectral theory for pertubation of Perron-Frobenius operator. This will enable us to prove the CLT (Theorem A) and obtain an estimate on the speed of convergence (Theorem B). Section 4 develops auxiliary tools used in Section 5 to prove the Local CLT (Theorem C).

Notation. For a normed-space E, denote by ||  ·  ||E its norm. We write Lp instead of [formula], where the Lp-norm of a form is the sum of its coefficients for a fixed atlas of [formula] If α10, α01 are forms of bidegrees (1,0) and (0,1) respectively, and α  =  α10  +  α01, we use the equivalent L2-norm [formula]. If T:E  →  E is a linear operator, we denote by ρ(T) its spectral radius. We also denote by Λ the operator [formula] even when it acts on forms. For a Radon measure ν, ||ν|| is its total variation. The constants C, C', C'' and Cε are not necessarily the same at each occurence; they depend possibly on some parameters.

Sobolev spaces

The Sobolev space W1,p, p  ≥  1, is the space of complex-valued functions φ in Lp such that dφ, which is defined in the sense of currents, has Lp coefficients, see [\cite=af] [\cite=he]. It is endowed with the canonical norm ||φ||W1,p  =  ||φ||Lp  +  ||dφ||Lp. Lipschitz functions belong to W1,p. Let L denote the Lebesgue measure of mass 1 on [formula] associated to the Fubini-Study form ω. Define for each L1 function its mean value [formula]. We have the following Poincaré-Sobolev inequality: for every real number p  ≥  1, there exists a constant C = C(p) such that

[formula]

In particular,

[formula]

Hence, W1,2  ⊂  Lp. Moreover, by Sobolev embedding theorem, the latter inclusion is compact. For every ε > 0, there is a constant C = C(ε) such that

[formula]

and

[formula]

(see, for example, Theorem 4.39 in [\cite=af]).

We recall from Lemmas 5.3 and 5.4 in [\cite=ds3] that

[formula]

and

[formula]

for every continuous φ∈W1,2 and n  ≥  0. Since smooth functions are dense in W1,2 we can extend μ to a continuous linear form of W1,2 in a canonical way. Therefore, ([\ref=DS_inequality_W_1])-([\ref=DS_inequality_W_2]) are still valid for any φ∈W1,2. Moreover, μ is strongly continuous (WPC in the sense of [\cite=ds3]), i.e. if φn  →  φ weakly and ||φn||W1,2 is bounded then μ(φn)  →  μ(φ). It follows that one can associate to each function in W1,2 a function in L1(μ) in a canonical way.

The following norm is equivalent to the standard norm of W1,2.

Inequality ([\ref=DS_inequality_W_1]) implies that ||φ||  ≤  C||φ||W1,2. From ([\ref=PS2_inequality]), we only need to check that there is a constant C such that

[formula]

To prove this, observe that m(φ - m(φ)) = 0. Therefore, by ([\ref=DS_inequality_W_1]), which implies ([\ref=eq_equivalent_norms]).

Central Limit Theorem and speed of convergence

For every [formula] and every real-valued function h, consider the pertubation of the Perron-Frobenius operator Λ

[formula]

We collect here some properties of the family of pertubations of Λ.

Assume that h is in W1,2 + ε for some ε > 0. Then

Λh(0) = Λ.

For every [formula] Λh(θ) is a bounded linear operator on W1,2.

The maps θ  ↦  Λh(θ) is analytic.

For every [formula] [formula] and every φ in W1,2, we have where [formula] for n  ≥  1 and S0h: = 0.

For the proof of Parts (2) and (3) we will need the following inequality

[formula]

This inequality is a consequence of the following estimates where we use ([\ref=PS2_inequality]), ([\ref=PS3_inequality]) and the classical Hölder inequality

[formula]

and

[formula]

Using ([\ref=eq1_prop_pertubated_oper])and ([\ref=eq_Banach_algebra_W]), we get

[formula]

Consequently, the series [formula] converges normally in W1,2. Its limit is equal to Λh(θ)(φ), and This gives (2) and (3).

Part (4) is proved by induction. Using ([\ref=eq_transfert]), we get [formula] for n  ≥  0. Hence

[formula]

This completes the proof.

The spectrum of Λh(θ) is described by the following pertubation theorem.

Let h be a real-valued function in W1,2 + ε. Then there exists a real number a > 0 such that for |θ| < a and [formula] we have the following decomposition where

λ(θ) is the eigenvalue with maximal modulus of Λh(θ), λ(0) = 1, and [formula]

Φ(θ) is the projection of W1,2 onto the eigenspace W1,2(λ(θ)) which is of dimension 1, and Φ(0)(φ) = μ(φ);

Ψ(θ) is a bounded linear operator on W1,2 with ρ(Ψ(θ)) < ρ1, and

θ  ↦  Φ(θ), θ  ↦  Ψ(θ), θ  ↦  λ(θ) are analytic maps on the disc {|θ| < a}.

Observe that Λ(1) = 1. Then, constant functions are eigenfunctions associated to the eigenvalue 1 of the operator Λh(0) = Λ. If λ(0), Φ(0) are as above and if Ψ(0): = Λ  -  Φ(0), then It follows from ([\ref=DS_inequality_W_2]) that [formula] Hence, λ(0) = 1 is the unique eigenvalue of maximal modulus of Λ and W1,2(λ(0)) is of dimension 1. Using Proposition [\ref=prop_pertubated_oper], it is enough to apply the Rellich pertubation method described in [\cite=dus] (see also [\cite=br], [\cite=lp]).

Now we are in position to prove the first main result.

When g = 1, we obtain the CLT for μ. Since the theorem holds for every ν = gμ, the set [formula] is asymptotically equidistributed with respect to μ as n  →    ∞  , because this set is independent of g.

Using Proposition [\ref=prop_pertubated_oper] and Theorem [\ref=thm_pertubation] the proof follows the same lines as in [\cite=br] or [\cite=re]. For the sake of clarity, we give here the main aguments. The proof is divided into four steps.

Step 1: Proof of the equality λ'(0) = 0. Since μ is totally invariant, we have [formula] for every φ∈L1(μ). This, Proposition [\ref=prop_pertubated_oper] and Theorem [\ref=thm_pertubation] imply that for [formula]

[formula]

We then use the Taylor expansion of order 2 at 0 of [formula] and [formula] Moreover, we use the estimate [formula] Therefore, one obtains that By Birkhoff's theorem, [formula] μ-a.e. Hence, λ'(0) = 0.

Step 2: Proof of the equality λ''(0) = σ2. Equality ([\ref=eq_sigma]) is easy to check using the invariance of μ. On the other hand,

[formula]

By Theorem [\ref=thm_pertubation], we may rewrite the expression in brackets in ([\ref=eq2_Step2_TheoremA]) as follows

[formula]

The derivative of the second term can be bounded by Cρn1 using Cauchy's formula. We use the Taylor expansion of order 2 at 0 of [formula] and [formula] and insert them into the above expansion. After taking the second derivative we see that the right hand side of ([\ref=eq2_Step2_TheoremA]) is equal to λ''(0). We use here the equality λ'(0) = 0.

Step 3: Proof of the equality [formula] By Theorem [\ref=thm_pertubation], we have

[formula]

As in Step 1, the last term in the above expression tends to 0 as n  →    ∞  . On the other hand, using the previous steps and the hypothesis μ(g) = 1, a straightforward computation gives that

[formula]

Replacing them in the right hand side of ([\ref=eq1_Step3_TheoremA]), we obtain the desired equality.

Step 4: Conclusion. Using Proposition [\ref=prop_pertubated_oper](4), we may rephrase the result of Step 3 as [formula] Since the right hand side of this equality is the Fourier transform of the normal law N(0,1), the Paul Lévy's method of characteristic functions implies that the sequence of random variables [formula] converges in law to the normal law. This implies the result.

We come to the second main result.

First we recall the Berry-Essen inequality (see [\cite=fe]) in our context. Namely, there is a positive constant K such that for V > 0,

Choose [formula] with a' < a small enough, where a is the constant given by Theorem [\ref=thm_pertubation]. Then for every t∈[ -  V,V], we have [formula] Consequently, applying Proposition [\ref=prop_pertubated_oper](4) and Theorem [\ref=thm_pertubation] yields that

[formula]

Theorem [\ref=thm_pertubation] also implies that [formula] for every φ. Moreover, the W1,2-norm of the operator Ψ(θ) - Ψ(0) satisfies ||Ψ(θ) - Ψ(0)||W1,2  ≤  C|θ|. Hence we can apply this to [formula] and obtain Now, we use the computation in the third step of the proof of Theorem A. From the inequalities 1 - e- sx  ≤  esx - 1  ≤  sex for 0  ≤  s  ≤  1 and x  ≥  0, we deduce that

[formula]

since [formula] when a' is small enough. It follows that

[formula]

Hence, Now we substitute [formula] into the latter estimate. Consequently, it follows from the Berry-Essen inequality that This completes the proof of the theorem.

Spectral decomposition of Λh(it) for t real

We begin with a version of the classical Ionescu-Tulcea and Marinescu theorem (see [\cite=tm] [\cite=no]).

Let V, L and K be three Banach spaces respectively endowed with norms ||  ·  ||V, ||  ·  ||L, ||  ·  ||K. Suppose that V  ⊂  L  ⊂  K and that there is a positive constant C satisfying the following properties

If (φn)∞n = 1  ⊂  V with ||φn||V  ≤  1, then there is a subsequence (φnj)∞j = 1 and an element φ∈V such that [formula] and ||φ||V  ≤  C.

||φ||K  ≤  C||φ||L, φ∈L.

Let T:K  →  K be a bounded linear operator such that T(V)  ⊂  V. Assume that

(Doeblin-Fortet inequality) There are two positive constants α < 1 and β such that ||T(φ)||V  ≤  α||φ||V  +  β||φ||L, φ∈V.

ρ(T|V)  ≤  1.

T|V admits no eigenvalue of modulus 1, that is, if [formula] and [formula] satisfy T(φ) = λφ, then [formula]

Then ρ(T|V)  <  1.

It suffices to prove for |λ| = 1 that (I - λT) admits a bounded linear inverse from V onto V. Fix a [formula] such that |λ0| = 1 and an arbitrary ψ∈V. We would like to find a suitable φ∈V such that (I - λ0T)φ  =  ψ. To this end pick an arbitrary sequence [formula], |λn| < 1, converging to λ0.

Observe that by (c), for every [formula] with |λ| < 1, ρ(λT) = |λ|ρ(T) < 1. Therefore, the series [formula] defines a bounded linear operator from V onto V which is the inverse of (I - λT). Consequently, for every n  ≥  1, one may find φn∈V such that

[formula]

We claim that

[formula]

If not, there is a subsequence (φnj)∞j = 1 such that lim j  →    ∞||φnj||L  =    ∞  . To simplify the notation assume that nj = j. Put [formula]. Then ([\ref=thm_TM_eq1]) may be rewritten as

[formula]

Consequently, using (b), we get

[formula]

Hence,

[formula]

Since by assumption lim j  →    ∞||φj||L  =    ∞  , it follows from the latter estimate that (φ'j)∞j = 1 is a bounded sequence in V. Therefore, by (a), there is a subsequence of (φ'j)∞j = 1 which converges in L to an element φ'∈V. Consequently, letting j tend to ∞   in ([\ref=thm_TM_eq3]) and using (a)' and the continuity of T:K  →  K, we obtain which contradicts (d). Hence, the proof of ([\ref=thm_TM_eq2]) is complete.

Using ([\ref=thm_TM_eq2]) and arguing as in ([\ref=thm_TM_eq4])-([\ref=thm_TM_eq5]), we can show that

[formula]

By (a), there is a subsequence of (φn)∞n = 1 which converges in L to an element φ∈V. This, combined with ([\ref=thm_TM_eq1]), implies that (I - λ0T)φ  =  ψ. Hence, (I - λ0T) is onto V. Recall from (c)-(d) that (I - λ0T) is one-to-one. If (ψ(n))  ⊂  V and (φ(n))  ⊂  V satisfy ||ψ(n)||V  =  1 and (I - λ0T)φ(n)  =  ψ(n), arguing as in ([\ref=thm_TM_eq4])-([\ref=thm_TM_eq6]) we show that (φ(n)) is bounded in L, and then in V. Therefore, (I - λ0T)- 1 exists and is bounded. This completes the proof.

The remaining of this section is devoted to an application of Theorem [\ref=thm_TM] in the case K: = L1, [formula] and V: = W1,2.

Let h be a real-valued function in W1,2 + ε, ε > 0. Then, the hypotheses (a)-(b) of Theorem [\ref=thm_TM] are fulfilled with K: = L1, [formula], V: = W1,2 and T: = Λh(it), [formula].

The hypothesis (a) is a consequence of the Sobolev embedding theorem. The hypothesis (a)' is obvious. The operator Λh(it):K  →  K is bounded since for every φ∈L1, we have

[formula]

We now check condition (b). Let φ∈W1,2. We first estimate ||dΛh(it)(φ)||L2. To this end we repeatedly apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. This inequality implies, in particular, that [formula] or equivalently [formula], where α is a (1,0)-form. Recall that [formula]. Using Proposition [\ref=prop_pertubated_oper](4) we obtain

[formula]

In the last line, we use the inequality [formula]. Consequently, since ||dψ||L2 = 2||∂ψ||L2 for every function ψ and [formula] for every 2-form β, we have

[formula]

Applying Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and Hölder's inequality, we may estimate the last integral

[formula]

Finally, we have shown that

[formula]

On the other hand, we deduce from ([\ref=PS2_inequality]) and ([\ref=DS_inequality_W_1])-([\ref=DS_inequality_W_2]) that This, combined with ([\ref=eq2_prop_DF_W]), implies the Doeblin-Fortet inequality with [formula] and β: = C'  +  C(h,ε,t).

Under the hypothesis of Proposition [\ref=prop_DF_W], the hypothesis (c) in Theorem [\ref=thm_TM] holds, i.e. we have [formula] for every [formula].

First, using Proposition [\ref=prop_pertubated_oper](4) and ([\ref=PS2_inequality])-([\ref=DS_inequality_W_2]), we have

[formula]

Now, we use Proposition [\ref=prop_pertubated_oper](4) and the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality repeatedly to estimate ||dΛnh(it)(φ)||L2. As in Proposition [\ref=prop_DF_W], we obtain

[formula]

For the first term we have

[formula]

For the second one we have

[formula]

Observe that for any complex-valued function ψ, we have Then This, combined with ([\ref=eq1_prop_spec_rad_W])-([\ref=eq2_prop_spec_rad_W]), implies that

[formula]

Applying Hölder's inequality, ([\ref=PS2_inequality]) and ([\ref=eq_module_phi]) yields that Since [formula] it follows that

[formula]

Combining this and ([\ref=eq_module_phi]), the desired conclusion follows.

Local Central Limit Theorem

First we introduce the following notion.

We have the following proposition.

Let h be a real-valued function in W1,2 + ε. Then h is not a multiplicative W1,2-cocycle if and only if the spectral radius of Λh(it):W1,2  →  W1,2 is strictly smaller than 1 for every t > 0.

First assume that h is not a multiplicative W1,2-cocycle. Suppose in order to get a contradiction that there is t > 0 such that [formula]. By Propositions [\ref=prop_DF_W], [\ref=prop_spec_rad_W] and Theorem [\ref=thm_TM], there are [formula] and [formula] such that Λh(it)(φ) = λφ and |λ| = 1. It follows that Λ(eithφ) = λφ, then Λ(|φ|)  ≥  |φ|. Since μ(Λ(|φ|)) = μ(|φ|), we deduce that Λ(|φ|) = |φ| μ-a.e. We also obtain |φ|  =  Λn(|φ|), and since Λn(|φ|) converges in L1(μ) to a constant, |φ| is constant μ-a.e. Next, we rewrite Λ(eithφ) = λφ as Since |φ| is constant, this is only possible if Since h is not a cocycle, this implies that φ = 0 for μ-a.e. [formula] Next, consider the function Λn(|φ|), [formula] Since one has just shown that μ(|φ|) = 0, it follows from ([\ref=DS_inequality_W_2]) and the identity Λh(it)(φ) = λφ that Letting n tend to ∞  , we obtain φ = 0, which is a contradiction.

Now, assume that [formula]. Then for φ∈W1,2 we have Λnh(it)(φ)  →  0 in W1,2. It follows that Λnh(it)(φ)  →  0 μ-a.e. If eith(z)φ(z) = eisφ(f(z)) μ-a.e. then Λnh(it)(φ) = einsφ μ-a.e. Hence φ = 0 μ-a.e. This implies that h is not a multiplicative W1,2-cocycle.

Now we are able to state the last main result.

We follow the proof given by Breiman (see [\cite=bl]) in the context of independant random variables. The proof of the above equality is reduced to showing that

[formula]

for every real-valued function [formula] whose Fourier transform [formula] is a continuous function supported in an interval
