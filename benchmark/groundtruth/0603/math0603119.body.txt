Sharp Spectral Asymptotics for Magnetic Schrödinger Operator with Irregular Potential.

this paper I consider sharp spectral asymptotics for multidimensional magnetic Schrödinger operator with irregular coefficients with respect to two parameters - semiclassical parameter h and coupling parameter μ. There are few principally different cases, depending on dimension, rank of magnetic intensity matrix, relation between h and μ and some extra assumptions.

Introduction

Preface

In this paper I consider multidimensional Schrödinger operator

[formula]

It is characterized by magnetic field intensity matrix (Fjk) with Fjk  =  (∂xjVk  -  ∂xkVj), which is skew-symmetric d  ×  d-matrix, and (Fjm) = (gjk)(Fkm) which is unitarily equivalent to skew-symmetric matrix [formula]. Then all eigenvalues of (Fjk) (with multiplicities) are ±  ifm (fm > 0, [formula]) and 0 of multiplicity q = d - 2r where [formula].

I formulate results only in the case of gjk  =  δjk (thus covering the case [formula] as well) and [formula] (then one can select linear vector potential [formula]). The results in the general case differ even in their statements. So we consider operator

[formula]

with linear functions Vj(x) and constant magnetic intensity matrix Fjk.

The main goal of this paper is to present the local spectral asymptotics, i.e. asymptotics of

[formula]

as h  →   + 0, μ  →    +    ∞   where e(x,y,τ) = eh,μ(x,y,τ) is the Schwartz kernel of the spectral projector of A (A is assumed to be a self-adjoint operator) and ψ is a smooth cut-off function supported in the ball [formula] (all the conjectures save self-adjointness are made for B(0,1)). Combined with partition-rescaling arguments such asymptotics imply many asymptotics of eigenvalue counting function given by formula ([\ref=0-3]) with ψ = 1.

Under above assumptions in the appropriate coordinates after gauge transform

[formula]

where fj > 0 and ±  ifj are eigenvalues of Fjk, [formula]. Let q = d - 2r.

In the special case [formula] everything becomes explicit: after h-Fourier transform with respect to [formula] and change of variables xj  ↦  xj  +  μ- 1f- 1jξ2j + 1 [formula] operator A is transformed into

[formula]

Using Hermite function decomposition one can calculate easily e(x,y,τ) and prove that

[formula]

where ωq is a volume of the unit ball in [formula], g =  det (gjk)- 1.

In particular, for q = 0 such operator has pure point spectrum of infinite multiplicity, consisting of Landau levels [formula] with [formula] while for q  ≥  1 the spectrum is absolutely continuous and Landau levels are merely bottoms of its channels [formula]ν((itholdswithν ( [formula]r≥ 2,q=1,2,V∈ Candconditions([\ref=0-7]),([\ref=2-11])hold.Then(i)Asq=2,(l,σ) (1,1)[formula]μ ≤ Ch;(ii)Asq=1,(l,σ) (1,2)[formula]μ ≤ Ch[formula]r≥ 2,q=1,2,V∈ Candconditions([\ref=0-7]),([\ref=2-11])hold.Then(i)Asq=2,(l,σ) (1,1)[formula]μ ≤ Ch;(ii)Asq=1,(l,σ) (1,2)[formula]μ ≤ Ch.Notethatinestimates() -  - ()right - handexpressionsaresumsoftheright - handexpressionsundernon - degeneracyconditionandoftheright - handexpressionswithoutmicrohyperbolicityconditions,butlatteraremultipliedbyν (μ h) (μ h)[formula]

Superstrong and ultrastrong magnetic field

In this case μ  ≥  εh- 1 and the distance Landau levels increases; in the case of the ultrastrong magnetic field only one (may be multiple) level should be considered.

Superstrong magnetic field

In this case h- 1ε  ≤  μ  ≤  Ch- 1 and the magnitude of the principal part of the asymptotics is still the same (h- d) as well as the remainder estimates in theorems [\ref=thm-2-1]-[\ref=2-4]. The only difference is that non-degeneracy condition ([\ref=0-8]) is replaced by

[formula]

(i) Statements of theorems [\ref=thm-2-2], [\ref=thm-2-4] remain true for h- 1ε  ≤  μ  ≤  Ch- 1;

(ii) Statements of theorems [\ref=thm-2-1], [\ref=thm-2-3] remain true for h- 1ε  ≤  μ  ≤  Ch- 1 with condition () replaced by () with τ = 0 and condition () skipped;

(iii) As q = 0 under condition

[formula]

with τ = 0 estimate R  ≤  Chs holds with arbitrarily large s (spectral gaps).

As 1  ≤  μ  ≤  Ch- 1 under condition

[formula]

estimate R  ≤  Chs holds with [formula] (τ = 0) and with arbitrarily large s.

Ultrastrong magnetic field

In this case μ  ≥  Ch- 1 and in order not to be below the bottom of the spectrum one should modify condition V∈Cl,σ. Assume instead that

[formula]

Let q = 0 and conditions (), () be fulfilled with τ = 0. Then

(i) Estimate

[formula]

holds for μ  ≥  Ch- 1;

(ii) Furthermore, under condition () estimate R  ≤  Cμ- s holds with arbitrarily large s.

Let q  ≥  1 and condition () be fulfilled. Then

(i) Estimate

[formula]

holds for μ  ≥  Ch- 1, q  ≥  3;

(ii) Estimate

[formula]

holds for μ  ≥  Ch- 1, q = 1,2; in particular, as q = 2, (l,σ) = (2,0) sharp remainder estimate () holds.

(iii) Under condition () sharp remainder estimate () holds for μ  ≥  Ch- 1, q = 1,2.

(iv) Under condition () estimate R  ≤  Cμrhs holds with [formula] (τ = 0) and with arbitrarily large s.

Remarks. Generalizations

One can generalize the results stated above.

One can get rid of condition ([\ref=0-7]) by method of rescaling; then all the results remain the same.

Instead of operator ([\ref=0-2]) one can consider operator ([\ref=0-1]) in its full generality:

(i) as q  ≥  3 no modification in conditions is needed.

(ii) As q = 0,1,2 non-degeneracy conditions ([\ref=0-8]) and ([\ref=3-1]) should be modified; as r = 1 one needs to replace [formula] by [formula] with f = f1 (τ = 0); as r  ≥  2 the modification is more profound because we are essentially in the matrix situation. For example if [formula] have constant multiplicities our condition looks like

[formula]

as (τ = 0) and we need to assume that ([\ref=0-7]) holds.

(iii) Smoothness conditions to gjk, Fjk should be at least (l,σ) and also at least (2,1) (required for reduction arguments) but for they could be even stronger to get a proper mollification error.

(iv) Constant multiplicity of fj which was taken for granted is no more guaranteed and the results of subsection 2.3 require it.

(v) Further, condition ([\ref=2-12]) should be fulfilled for [formula] integrated with respect to x and it is fulfilled automatically with ν(κ provided [formula] has at least rank κ - 1.

(vi) As q = 1 and non-degeneracy condition is not fulfilled, unremovable O(μ- 1)) terms in the canonical form could lead to a some correction term in order to save the estimate. These terms can appear due to variable gjk, Fjk even if [formula] and they are unremovable due to the third-order resonances.

(vii) In the case of q = 0 and the ultrastrong magnetic field one should require that for each [formula] such that [formula]   for each j either [formula] or fj has a constant multiplicity.

(i) The results of this article are proven in three papers [\cite=IRO3], [\cite=IRO4], [\cite=IRO5] where the first one is dealing with 2,3-dimensional cases and the second and the third are dealing with the higher dimensions. One can access them from

http://www.math.toronto.edu:/ivrii/Research/preprints.html

as well as relevant talks to be viewed on a computer screen rather than printed.

(ii) I my forthcoming papers I am planning to get rid off assumption "[formula]"; surely results of the case q = 0 will be no more valid.
