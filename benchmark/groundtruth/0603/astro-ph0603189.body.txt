Chemical Self-Enrichment of H ii Regions by the Wolf-Rayet Phase of an [formula] star

Introduction

H ii regions are considered as the most reliable targets for the determination of the present-day abundances in the Interstellar Medium (ISM). Nevertheless, heavy elements are released by massive stars into their surrounding H ii  regions. The knowledge of its amount is of particular interest for the observation of very metal-poor galaxies. [\citet=kunth] e.g. discussed the problem of determining the heavy-element abundance of very metal-poor blue compact dwarf galaxies from emission lines of H ii regions in the light of local self-enrichment by massive stars. This can happen during two stages in their evolutionary course: In the Wolf-Rayet (WR) stage, when the stellar wind has peeled off the outermost stellar layers, and by supernovae of type II (SNeII). Because of their energetics, stellar winds and SNeII contribute their gas to the hot phase. Therefore, it is of high relevance for observations and the addressed question of the presented exploration to study the amount to what it can be mixed into the diagnosed H ii regions.

As discussed by [\citet=cm], massive stars with an initial mass greater than [formula] evolve into WR stars with enhanced mass-loss rates and chemically enriched stellar winds.

[\citet=abbott] concluded from stellar evolution models that WR winds strongly contribute to the Galactic enrichment of 4He, 12C, 17O, and 22Ne, while contributing only moderately to the enrichment of 14N, 26Mg, 25Mg, and 16O.

For metallicities less than solar two effects reduce the heavy element release by WR stars: First, the lower the metallicity the more massive a star has to be to evolve through the WR stages. Therefore, the number of WR stars decreases with decreasing metallicity. [\citet=schaller:1992] found that with metallicity Z = 0.001 the minimal initial H-ZAMS mass for a WR star is [formula]. At Z = 0.02 the minimal initial mass is [formula]. Second, the lower the metallicity the shorter are the WR lifetimes, and not all WR stages are reached. At solar metallicity WR stars enter all three WR stages (WNL, WNE, WC), whereas at Z = 0.001 only the WNL phase is reached [\citepalias=schaller:1992]. The WR lifetime of an [formula] star, e.g., is [formula] at Z = 0.001 and [formula] at Z = 0.02 [\citepalias=schaller:1992].

That WR stars play an important role for carbon enrichment of the ISM at solar metallicity was shown by [\citet=dtkl]. Their models predict that the C enrichment by WR stars is at least comparable to that by AGB stars while the enrichment of N is dominated by AGB stars and the O enrichment is dominated by SNeII. At other metallicities [\citet=dray] found an increase in carbon enrichment with increasing metallicity but a decrease in oxygen enrichment. The N enrichment by WR stars is negligible compared to that by other sources. Additionally, the total amount of N ejected by a WR star generally decreases with decreasing metallicity.

[\citet=hirschi:2004] [\citet=hirschi:2005] showed that the consideration of stellar rotation in the Geneva stellar evolution code increases the yields for heavy elements by a factor of 1.5  -  2.5 for stars between [formula]. For the more massive stars rotation raises the yields of 4 and other H-burning products like 14, but the yields of He-burning products like 12 are smaller. Additionally, for stars with [formula], the evolution differs from that of non-rotating stars by the following manner: Rotating stars enter the WR regime already in the course of their main-sequence.

As an extent to stellar evolution models mentioned above hydrodynamical simulations of radiation and wind-driven H ii regions can trace the spatial distribution of the elements ejected by the star, and, therefore, we can study the mixing of the hot chemically enriched stellar wind with the warm photoionized gas.

The model

We analyze the model of an [formula] star in a series of radiation and wind-driven H ii regions around massive stars [\citep=tim] [\citep=timII] [\citep=kfhy] as described in [\citetalias=kfhy]. A description of the numerical method and further references are given in [\citetalias=tim]. The time-dependent parameters of the [formula] star with "standard" mass-loss and solar metallicity (Z  =  0.02) during its H-MS and its subsequent evolution are taken from [\citetalias=schaller:1992], who used the relative abundance ratios of [\citet=anders] for the heavy elements.

An [formula] star with solar abundance enters its WN stage at an age of t  =  2.83. The WR star enriches the combined SWB/H ii region with 12C, 14N, and 16O. In our 2D simulations we study the spatial distribution of these tracer elements inside the SWB/H ii region as well as their time-dependent mass ratios as [formula], [formula], and [formula] in two different temperature regimes: "warm" gas [formula] accounts for the gas of the H ii region, and "hot" gas, whose temperatures [formula] are reached inside the SWB. Additionally, for the H ii region diagnostic a degree of ionization of ≥  0.95 must be reached. The undisturbed ambient medium outside the H ii region as well as the material swept-up by the expanding H ii region are not counted since they are not ionized. The observable abundances of H ii regions are derived for the warm phase only.

The mass fractions of 12, 14, and 16 in the circumstellar gas as well as of the star itself are initially set to the solar values, taken from [\citet=anders], 4.466  ×  10- 3, 1.397  ×  10- 3, and 1.061  ×  10- 2, respectively, in relation to H.

Results

The spatial distribution of the tracer elements is shown as [formula] at different stages of stellar evolution, where "element" means [formula] (Fig. [\ref=CNO], middle column), [formula] (Fig. [\ref=CNO], left column), or [formula] (Fig. [\ref=CNO], right column), respectively. All plots cover the whole computational domain of 60  ×  60. The gas density is overlaid as a contour plot. Before the onset of the WN phase, these density ratios are unity by definition. With the onset of the WN phase the combined SWB/H ii region is chemically enriched by the WR wind.

We study the temporal evolution of 12, 14, and 16, respectively, normalized to solar values in the two different temperature regimes of the combined SWB/H ii region: For the hot gas of the SWB the mass ratios are depicted in Figure [\ref=C12_N14_O16_hot]. Figure [\ref=C12_N14_O16_warm] shows it for the "warm" H ii gas (see § [\ref=model]).

Chemical enrichment of the stellar wind bubble

In the hot gas of the SWB the abundance of [formula] at t  =  2.99 (close to the end of the WN phase, Fig. [\ref=CNO], upper left plot) that lasts only for ≈  0.17, reaches values in the range of [formula]. [formula] is distributed in the whole SWB except in the H ii material enveloped by the SWB. 12 and 16 can be found at the same places, but their concentration is as low as [formula] and [formula].

During its WN phase the star releases [formula] of [formula], which is more than half of its total [formula] release, but almost no extra [formula] or [formula] is supplied.

With the onset of the WC phase at t  =  3.005 the [formula] release ends and the main enrichment of the SWB with [formula] and [formula] starts. Due to the beginning WC phase with its high mass-loss rates and high terminal wind velocity the previously ejected material in the SWB including the emitted [formula] is compressed into a shell-like structure. Therefore, after t  =  3.005 12 and 16 are distributed in the whole SWB and 14 can mostly be found in an expanding shell (see lower left plot of Fig. [\ref=CNO], at t  =  3.22). The density contour line at a radius of 28 in the upper middle and upper right plots of Fig. [\ref=CNO] (t  =  3.06) marks the position of the reverse shock which borders the free-flowing wind zone. At 3.06 the radius of the reverse shock has reached its biggest extent.

During this evolutionary phase (see upper middle and upper right plots in Fig. [\ref=CNO], at 3.06) the star ejects large amounts of [formula] and [formula]: The [formula] value reaches ≈  1.86 inside the highly enriched SWB and the [formula] maximum value is ≈  1.35.

At the end of its lifetime at t  =  3.22 the [formula] star has supplied [formula] of 14, [formula] of 12, and [formula] of 16, which are contained in the combined SWB/H ii region. This situation is shown in the lower plots of Fig. [\ref=CNO]. The reverse shock is now located at a radius of 9, the hot gas of the SWB fills the area up to a radius of 39. Almost all of the ejected 12, 14, and 16 is located in the SWB's volume.

In the outer zones of the SWB the highest abundance of 12 (see lower middle plot of Fig. [\ref=CNO]) is locally reached with [formula]. For radii [formula] the value is ≈  1.74.

The [formula] ratio (Fig. [\ref=CNO], lower left) reaches   ≈  0.55 in the outer zones of the SWB, where the material ejected during the WN phase is located. In the inner parts of the SWB only [formula] and [formula] can be found.

The maximum of the [formula] value (Fig. [\ref=CNO], lower right) of ≈  1.65 is reached at radii [formula]. Within the outer parts of the SWB the values range from 0.5 to 1.4, highly depending on the location, since the abundance within the embedded clumps differs from that of the hot SWB material.

The temporal evolution of the 12 abundance in the hot gas phase is plotted in Fig. [\ref=C12_N14_O16_hot] as dash-dotted line. The plot starts at t = 2.83, when the WN phases are reached. Additionally, the onset of the WC phase at t = 3.005 is indicated. During the WN phase the stellar parameters [\citepalias=schaller:1992] specify the 12 abundance of the WR wind to about 1 / 14 solar. Due to the mixing of the WR wind with the main-sequence wind the averaged mass ratio in the hot gas of the SWB is only 0.7 times solar during the WN and early WC phase. The 12 enrichment starts with the onset of the WC phase. After the newly ejected material passed the reverse shock the 12 abundance in the hot gas reaches 2.1 times the solar value at t  =  3.02. This value increases further to 38 times solar at the end of the stellar lifetime.

The 14 abundance is depicted in Fig. [\ref=C12_N14_O16_hot] as solid line. It rises as the enriched free-floating stellar wind passes the reverse shock, where the material is heated to several 107. Since in the WC stage the stellar wind contains no 14, the 14 abundance in the hot SWB decreases strongly after it reached its maximum value of 3.4 times solar at t  =  3.0. At the end of the stellar lifetime the 14 abundance in the hot gas phase is only 0.8 times solar.

Because the enrichment with 16 starts together with 12 at the onset of the WC phase and due to the high mass-loss rate in the WC phase the O-abundance in the hot gas phase rises steeply after the material passed the reverse shock. After t  =  3.02 the 16 mass ratio in the hot gas becomes supersolar and increases until the end of the stellar lifetime up to 15.7 times solar.

Chemical enrichment of the H ii region

During the WR phases of the [formula] star the SWB expands into the surrounding H ii region without being bordered by a shock front. Therefore, the hot SWB gas structures the H ii region and encloses H ii gas which is thus compressed into clumps. This embedded H ii material contributes to the warm gas phase as well as the H ii layer around the SWB.

At the end of the stellar lifetime the 12 abundance (lower middle plot in Fig. [\ref=CNO]) in the H ii layer reaches a local maximum of [formula]. It contains a small fraction of [formula], the [formula] values there are up to 0.01 (Fig. [\ref=CNO], lower left). The [formula] values (Fig. [\ref=CNO], lower right) range from 0 to 0.03.

The temporal evolution of the 12 abundance is plotted as dash-dotted line in Fig. [\ref=C12_N14_O16_warm]. As in Fig. [\ref=C12_N14_O16_hot], the plot starts with the beginning of the WN phases, the vertical dotted line indicates the onset of the WC phase. In the warm H ii gas the averaged 12 abundance reaches supersolar values after t  =  3.02, thus the enriched material needs about 1.5  ×  104 for its way from the stellar surface, through the SWB, until it reaches the H ii region and mixes with the warm H ii gas. It rises steeply until reaching a value of 1.21 times solar at t  =  3.15 and is 1.22 times solar at t  =  3.22.

The 14 mass fraction (solid curve in Fig. [\ref=C12_N14_O16_warm]) in the warm gas phase rises to supersolar values after t  =  2.88 when the 14 has passed the SWB and cools down to H ii temperatures. As discussed for Fig. [\ref=CNO], after t  =  3.0 the 14-enriched material can only be found in the shell-like structure in the outer zones of the SWB. The 14 abundance in the warm H ii gas reaches its maximum of 1.008 times solar at t  =  3.11 and has a value of 1.006 times solar at the end of the stellar lifetime.

For the warm gas the 16 mass ratio is given as dashed line in Fig. [\ref=C12_N14_O16_warm]. Like 12 it reaches supersolar values after t  =  3.02. Until the end of the stellar lifetime it increases slightly but reaches only 1.06 times the solar value at t  =  3.22.

Discussion

This chemical analysis of the wind and radiation-driven H ii region around an [formula] star with solar metallicity provides first quantitative conclusions to what extent the C, N, O-enriched WR winds contribute to the observable abundances of the surrounding H ii region.

When comparing the C, N, O abundances in our simulation with observed values, one has to take into account that the overall lifetime as well as the WR lifetime of the [formula] star are extremely short compared to less massive stars. Also, the choice of the stellar parameters of [\citetalias=schaller:1992] influences our results, since other evolutionary tracks would provide other WR lifetimes as well as other mass-loss rates (see, e.g., [\citetalias=kfhy]).

At the end of the stellar lifetime, the 12 abundance in the warm gas phase amounts to 22.3% above solar, whereas we find only 0.6% supersolar for 14, and 5.5% supersolar for 16. These values measured in the warm gas phase are the quantities which should be compared with observed H ii regions' emission spectra.

On the other hand, the hot gas of the WR wind bubble is highly enriched with 12 and 16 since the onset of the WC phase, while it was significantly enriched with 14 during the preceeding WN phase.

From these models we conclude that the enrichment of the circumstellar environment with 14 and 16 by WR stars might be negligible if the [formula] star is representative for massive stars passing the WR stage. Only for 12 the enrichment of the H ii gas is significant.

Since the occurrence of a WR phase is strongly metal dependent the enrichment with C should also depend on metallicity like e.g. on O. One should therefore expect that the C gradient of H ii regiones in galactic discs is steeper than that of O. And indeed, [\citet=esteban] found [formula] for the Galactic disk.

In metal-poor galaxies one would expect less chemical self-enrichment because the stellar mass range of the WR occurrence is shrinked and shifted towards higher masses and the WR phases are shorter.
