Degrees of stretched Kostka coefficients

Introduction

Kostka coefficients are important numbers appearing in many branches of mathematics, including representation theory, the theory of symmetric functions, and algebraic geometry (see, e.g., [\cite=Ful97] [\cite=Sta77] [\cite=Sta99] and references therein). Given a dominant weight λ and a weight β of the Lie algebra [formula], the Kostka coefficient Kλβ is the dimension of the weight subspace with weight β of the irreducible representation Vλ of [formula] [\cite=FH91]. In the theory of symmetric functions, Kostka coefficients are defined by the expansion of Schur functions sλ into monomials. That is, given a partition λ of [formula] with r parts, we have that

[formula]

where [formula].

Since the parameters defining a Kostka coefficient are themselves vectors, they may be "stretched" by an integer scaling factor n. This procedure defines a function n  ↦  Knλ,nβ, which, following [\cite=KTT04], we call a stretched Kostka coefficient. We denote this function by Kλβ(n)  =  Knλ,nβ. Kirillov and Reshetikhin have shown that Kλβ(n) is a polynomial function of n [\cite=KR86] (see also [\cite=DLM04]). King, Tollu, and Toumazet have conjectured that these polynomials have only positive coefficients [\cite=KTT04], and they have given a conjectural expression for the degree of Kλβ(n) [\cite=KTT06]. The main result of this note (Theorem [\ref=main] below) is that the stretched Kostka coefficients indeed have the degrees conjectured in [\cite=KTT06].

For our purposes, it will suffice to assume that λ is a partition and β is a composition of the same length and size as λ. That is, we take [formula] such that [formula] and [formula] such that [formula]. The Kostka coefficients Kλβ are indexed by such pairs (λ,β). We sometimes write [formula] to indicate that λ has vp parts equal to κp for 1  ≤  p  ≤  m. The use of this notation always presumes that vp  ≥  1 for 1  ≤  p  ≤  m.

Let [formula] denote the size of λ. Given an arbitrary sequence of nonnegative integers [formula], let [formula] be the unique partition that may be produced by permuting the terms of β. We say that λ dominates β, denoted [formula], if [formula] and [formula] for 1  ≤  i  <  r. If, in addition, [formula] for 1  ≤  i  <  r, we write [formula], and we say that λ and β form a primitive pair.

Suppose that [formula] is a partition and β is a composition such that [formula]. Then the degree of the stretched Kostka coefficient Kλβ(n) is given by

[formula]

(where we evaluate [formula]) .

As stated, Theorem [\ref=main] gives the degree of a stretched Kostka coefficient only when λ and β are a primitive pair. However, Berenstein and Zelevinsky have shown that all Kostka coefficients factor into a product of Kostka coefficients indexed by primitive pairs [\cite=BZ90]. It follows from this factorization that Theorem [\ref=main] suffices to describe the degrees of stretched Kostka coefficients in all cases.

The factorization of Kostka coefficients works as follows. It is well known that Kλβ is invariant under permutations of the coordinates of β. For example, this follows from equation [\eqref=symmfunc] and the fact that Schur functions are symmetric. Consequently, [formula]. In particular, to compute the degree of stretched Kostka coefficients, we need only consider the case where β is a partition.

Suppose that [formula] are both partitions with [formula]. If λ and β do not form a primitive pair, then we may write λ and β, respectively, as concatenations of partitions such that each of the partitions contained in λ forms a primitive pair with the corresponding partition contained in β. More precisely, there exists a unique sequence of integers such that each pair is primitive. We then have This observation of Berenstein and Zelevinsky [\cite=BZ90] is the justification for the terminology primitive pair. Since the set of indices [formula] decomposing (λ,β) into primitive pairs does not change when we scale λ and β by a parameter n, this decomposition carries over to the stretched Kostka coefficients: Consequently, we have that where each term in the sum may be computed using Theorem [\ref=main].

This note is organized as follows. In Section [\ref=sec:dimensions], we discuss the polyhedral model of Kostka coefficients using Gelfand-Tsetlin polytopes. In this context, the degrees of stretched Kostka coefficients are the dimensions of these polytopes. We prove that the expression in Theorem [\ref=main] gives the dimension of a Gelfand-Tsetlin polytope under certain generic circumstances. In Section [\ref=sec:degKostka], we show that these circumstances obtain precisely when the corresponding Kostka coefficient is indexed by a primitive pair, proving Theorem [\ref=main].

Dimensions of Gelfand-Tsetlin polytopes

Several combinatorial interpretations of Kostka coefficients have appeared in the literature. Most classically, Kλβ is the number of semi-standard Young tableaux with shape λ and content β (see, e.g., [\cite=Sta97]). Of particular interest for our study is the representation of Kostka coefficients as the number of lattice points in particular families of rational polytopes. Gelfand and Tsetlin provided the first such model [\cite=GT50], which we describe and employ in our study below.

The theory of lattice point enumeration has proved to be a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of Kostka coefficients. For example, Billey, Guillemin, and Rassart have used vector partition functions to show that Kλβ(n) can be expressed as a multivariate piecewise polynomial in n and the cooridinates of λ and β. They also examined factorizations of these polynomials and gave upper bounds on their degrees [\cite=BGR04]. More recently, King, Tollu, and Toumazet have introduced K-hive polytopes [\cite=KTT04], which they used to motivate the conjectures mentioned in the introduction. Moreover, they deduce from their model additional information about the structure of the polynomials Kλβ(n). Among other results, they provide an interpretation for the roots of Kλβ(n).

Expressing Kostka coefficients using Gelfand-Tsetlin polytopes provides a natural geometric interpretation of the polynomial Kλβ(n) and its degree. To each Kostka coefficient Kλβ, there corresponds a Gelfand-Tsetlin polytope [formula] such that [formula], where [formula]. As a consequence of the definition of Gelfand-Tsetlin polytopes (Definition [\ref=GTpolydef] below), scaling λ and β by a positive integer n corresponds to dilating the polytope GTλβ by n: As mentioned in the introduction, Kirillov and Reshetikhin have shown that Kλβ(n) is in fact a polynomial function of n. As is well known from the theory of lattice point enumeration in polyhedra, if the number of lattice points in an integer dilation nP of a polytope P is a polynomial function of n, then the degree of that polynomial is the dimension of P (see, e.g., [\cite=Sta97]). Our proof of Theorem [\ref=main] depends on this interpretation of  deg Kλβ(n) as the dimension of the Gelfand-Tsetlin polytope GTλβ, which we now define.

Let Xr be the set of triangular arrays [formula]. Note that Xr inherits a normed vector space structure under the obvious isomorphism [formula]. Therefore, we will be able to speak of cones, lattices, and polytopes in Xr. It is customary to depict an array in Xr by arranging its entries as follows: Within the space Xr, we define the cone of Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns, or GT-patterns, as follows. A GT-pattern is a triangular array [formula] satisfying the Gelfand-Tsetlin inequalities

[formula]

For any point [formula], we define the highest weight [formula] of [formula] to be the top row [formula] of [formula], and we define the weight [formula] of [formula] by β1  =  x11 and [formula] for 2  ≤  j  ≤  r. Thus, [formula] and [formula] are both linear maps [formula].

For each [formula], let GTλ be the polytope of GT-patterns with highest weight λ: Note that the GT inequalities [\eqref=eq:gtineq] force the top row of a GT-pattern to be weakly decreasing, so [formula] if λ is not weakly decreasing. (The converse is also true, since if λ is weakly decreasing, then (xij)1  ≤  i  ≤  j  ≤  r with xij  =  λi is a GT-pattern in GTλ.) For each [formula], let Wβ  ⊂  Xr be the affine subspace of points in Xr with weight β:

Given [formula], the Gelfand-Tsetlin polytope GTλβ is the convex polytope of GT-patterns with highest weight λ and weight β: Observe that each GT-pattern [formula] lives in a unique GT-polytope. We denote this polytope by [formula]

We associate to each GT-pattern a certain combinatorial object, called a tiling. Tilings of the GT-patterns in a GT-polytope have a poset structure isomorphic to the face lattice of the GT-polytope. In particular, the tiling of a point [formula] provides a straight-forward way to compute the dimension of the lowest-dimensional face of [formula] that contains [formula] (Theorem [\ref=facedimension]).

The tiling [formula] of [formula] is that partition of the set into subsets, called tiles, that results from grouping together those entries in [formula] that are equal and adjacent. More precisely, [formula] is that partition of I such that two pairs (i,j),(i',j') are in the same tile if and only if there are sequences such that, for each [formula], we have that and xik + 1jk + 1  =  xikjk.

In other words, the tiles are the connected components in the graph of a Gelfand-Tsetlin pattern. See Figure [\ref=fig:extiling] for examples of GT-patterns and their tilings. The shading of some of the tiles in that figure is explained below.

Given a GT-pattern [formula] with tiling [formula], we associate to [formula] (or, equivalently, to [formula]) a matrix [formula] (or [formula]) as follows. Define the free rows of [formula] to be those that are neither the top nor the bottom row of [formula]. The free tiles [formula] of [formula] are those tiles in [formula] that intersect only free rows of [formula]--i.e., those tiles that contain neither (1,1) nor (i,r) for 1  ≤  i  ≤  r. The remaining tiles are the non-free tiles. The order in which the free tiles are indexed will not matter for our purposes, but, for concreteness, we adopt the convention of indexing the free tiles in the order that they are initially encountered as the entries of [formula] are read from left to right and bottom to top. Define the tiling matrix [formula] by That is, ajk counts the number of entries in the jth free row of [formula] that are contained in the free tile Pk. While a different choice of order for the free tiles would result in a tiling matrix with permuted columns, this will be immaterial because we will ultimately be interested only in the rank of [formula]. The terminology free tile represents the fact that the entries in the non-free tiles of [formula] are fixed once the weight and highest weight of [formula] are fixed.

The primary motivation for introducing tilings of GT-patterns is the following Theorem:

Suppose that [formula] is the tiling of a GT-pattern [formula]. Then the dimension of the kernel of [formula] is equal to the dimension of the minimal (dimensional) face of the GT-polytope containing [formula].

Theorem [\ref=facedimension] was used in [\cite=DLM04] to study the properties of vertices of GT-polytopes, establishing in particular that they can have arbitrarily large denominators. In the present note, we move to the opposite end of the face lattice and apply the tiling machinery to points in the interior of GT-polytopes. We use the notation [formula] to denote the relative interior of a polytope P--that is, the interior of P with respect to the affine space that it spans. As an immediate corollary to Theorem [\ref=facedimension], we get:

If [formula], then [formula].

If [formula], the tilings of GT-patterns in the relative interior of GTλ have an easy characterization. Observe that if a block of entries [formula] in the top row of a GT-pattern all have the same value κp, then the GT inequalities [\eqref=eq:gtineq] require that the entries xij with [formula] all assume that same value κp. These are the entries that lie within the triangular region whose horizontal edge consists of the entries [formula] and whose diagonal edges run parallel to the diagonals of the GT-pattern. Let Tp be the tile of entries in this region. That is, if [formula], put Define the generic interior tiling [formula] associated with λ to be the tiling consisting of these Tp's together with a distinct tile for each entry not contained in one of the Tp's. See Figure [\ref=fig:tiling] for an example of a generic interior tiling when [formula]. The shaded tile at the bottom of the pattern, and each of the unshaded free tiles, contains only a single entry.

The next theorem characterizes when a GT-pattern [formula] has the generic interior tiling and gives the dimension of the GT-polytope containing [formula]. This is the main result from which Theorem [\ref=main] will follow.

Let [formula].

A GT-pattern [formula] is in the relative interior of GTλ if and only if the tiling of [formula] is the generic interior tiling [formula].

If [formula] has the generic interior tiling [formula] and m  ≥  2, then (where we evaluate [formula]).

To prove part (1), note that the GT inequalities [\eqref=eq:gtineq] include the facet-defining inequalities of GTλ in Xr. A point [formula] lies in the relative interior of GTλ if and only if [formula] satisfies with equality only those GT-inequalities that are satisfied with equality by every point in GTλ.

We claim that the GT-inequalities satisfied with equality by every point in GTλ are precisely the ones implied by forcing each entry in Tp to be equal to κp for 1  ≤  p  ≤  m. Since every point in GTλ must satisfy those equalities, it remains only to exhibit a point [formula] satisfying only those equalities. That is, we need to construct an [formula] with the generic interior tiling.

For 1  ≤  p  ≤  m - 1, consider the upper-left-to-lower-right diagonals that abut the tile Tp. Let Sp be the set of entries in these diagonals. Apply a total order to Sp by reading each diagonal from left to right, and then reading the diagonals themselves from left to right. Finally, construct [formula] by assigning values to the entries in Sp according to a strictly monotonically decreasing function mapping Sp into the open interval [formula]. For example, in the portion depicted in Figure [\ref=fig:filling], we fill the tiles with strictly decreasing values in the order indicated by the arrows. It is easy to see that [formula] is a GT-pattern and that its tiling is [formula], so part (1) is proved.

To prove part (2), suppose that [formula] has the generic interior tiling. Then, by part (1), we have that [formula]. Thus, we can apply Corollary [\ref=intpointdim] to compute [formula]. The hypothesis that m  ≥  2 implies that every free row of [formula] contains a free tile. Hence, each of the r - 2 rows of the tiling matrix [formula] contains a nonzero entry. Moreover, since every free tile of the generic interior tiling [formula] contains only a single entry, every column of [formula] contains only a single 1. Thus, [formula] is in reduced row echelon form (perhaps after a suitable permutation of its columns, which amounts to re-indexing the free tiles). This means that

[formula]

Thus the computation reduces to finding the number of free tiles in [formula], which is easily done: Hence, as claimed.

The degree of stretched Kostka coefficients

In the previous section, we showed that if the interior points of GTλβ have the generic interior tiling, then the dimension of GTλβ is given by the expression in Theorem [\ref=main]. To complete our proof of Theorem [\ref=main], it remains only to show that, if [formula], then the interior points of GTλβ have the generic interior tiling. To this end, we call upon a well-known fact from the theory of convex polytopes.

Given a polytope [formula] and a linear map [formula], we have that [formula].

The converse containment is also true and easy to prove, but it is unnecessary for our purposes. It is also worth mentioning that this is the point at which the geometry of convex polyhedra is crucial to the argument. Lemma [\ref=inttoint] does not hold for every polyhedral set, even if it is connected and full-dimensional. For completeness, we now give a proof of Lemma [\ref=inttoint].

Without loss of generality, we assume that  dim P  =  m and  dim π(P)  =  n. Suppose that [formula]. We show that [formula] by exhibiting an "exit vector" [formula] such that, for every ε  >  0, [formula]. Since we assume that π(P) is full-dimensional, this will prove the claim.

Since [formula], we have that [formula]. The sets π- 1(y) and [formula] are both convex, so there is a hyperplane H separating them. Let [formula] be a normal to H pointing away from P. Then, for every x'∈π- 1(y) and ε  >  0, we have that [formula]. Let [formula]. Suppose that ε  >  0 and that [formula] is such that [formula]. Then [formula], so [formula]. In other words, [formula], proving the claim.

Let [formula] be the image of GTλ under the map [formula]. Note that for [formula], we have [formula]. It is well known that [formula] if and only if [formula] [\cite=KB95]. For, if [formula], then Kλβ  >  0 (see, e.g., [\cite=FH91]), so GTλβ contains an integral point. Conversely, if [formula], then some integral multiple nGTλβ  =  GTnλ,nβ contains an integral point. Hence, Knλ,nβ  >  0, so [formula]. Since the relative order of two weights is not changed by scaling both by n, it follows that [formula]. This establishes the following lemma:

Suppose that [formula] is a partition. Then [formula]. Consequently, if [formula], then [formula].

Putting together the preceding results, we are now ready to prove Theorem [\ref=main] from page .

The claim is trivial if r = 1, so suppose that r  ≥  2. From Lemmas [\ref=permint] and [\ref=inttoint], we have that Hence, Choose [formula]. By part (1) of Theorem [\ref=maincor], [formula] has the generic interior tiling [formula]. Note that since [formula], we must have that m  ≥  2, for otherwise the GT-inequalities would force β1  =  λ1. Hence, we may apply part (2) of Theorem [\ref=maincor] to compute the dimension of [formula]. Since the dimension of GTλβ is the degree of Kλβ(n) [\cite=Sta97], this yields

[formula]

as claimed.
