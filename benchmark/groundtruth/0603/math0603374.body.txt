Introduction

Throughout this paper, [formula] denotes the field of complex numbers, [formula] and [formula] is transcendental.

The notion of a noncommutative noetherian unique factorisation domain (UFD for short) has been introduced and studied by Chatters and Jordan in [\cite=ch] [\cite=cj]. Recently, the present authors, together with L Rigal, [\cite=llr], have shown that many quantum algebras are noetherian UFD. In particular, we have shown that the quantum group Oq(SLn) is a noetherian UFD.

Let G be a connected simply connected complex semisimple algebraic group. Since in the classical setting it was shown by Popov, [\cite=p], that the ring of regular functions on G is a unique factorisation domain, one can ask if a similar result holds for the quantisation Oq(G) of the coordinate ring of G. The aim of this note is to provide a positive answer to this question. In order to do this, we use a stratification of the prime spectrum of Oq(G) that was constructed by Joseph, [\cite=josephbook].

Quantised enveloping algebras and quantum coordinate rings

Quantised enveloping algebras

Let [formula] be a complex semisimple Lie algebra of rank n. We denote by [formula] the set of simple roots associated to a triangular decomposition [formula]. Recall that π is a basis of a euclidean vector space E over [formula], whose inner product is denoted by (,) (E is usually denoted by [formula] in Bourbaki). We denote by W the Weyl group of [formula]; that is, the subgroup of the orthogonal group of E generated by the reflections si: = sαi, for [formula], with reflecting hyperplanes Hi: = {β∈E|(β,αi) = 0}, for [formula]. If w∈W, we denote by l(w) its length. Further, we denote by w0 the longest element of W. Throughout this paper, the Coxeter group W will be endowed with the Bruhat order that we denote by ≤  . We refer the reader to [\cite=josephbook] for the definition and properties of the Bruhat order.

We denote by R+ the set of positive roots and by R the set of roots. We set [formula]. We denote by [formula] the fundamental weights, by P the [formula]-lattice generated by [formula], and by P+ the set of dominant weights. In the sequel, P will always be endowed with the following partial order:

[formula]

Finally, we denote by [formula] the Cartan matrix associated to these data.

Recall that the scalar product of two roots (α,β) is always an integer. As in [\cite=bg], we assume that the short roots have length [formula].

For each [formula], set [formula] and

[formula]

for all integers 0  ≤  k  ≤  m. By convention, we have

[formula]

We will use the definition of the quantised enveloping algebra given in [\cite=bg]. The quantised enveloping algebra [formula] of [formula] over [formula] associated to the previous data is the [formula]-algebra generated by indeterminates [formula] subject to the following relations:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

and the quantum Serre relations:

[formula]

and

[formula]

Note that [formula] is a Hopf algebra; its comultiplication is defined by

[formula]

its counit by

[formula]

and its antipode by

[formula]

We refer the reader to [\cite=bg] [\cite=jantzen] [\cite=josephbook] for more details on this algebra. Further, as usual, we denote by [formula] the subalgebra of [formula] generated by [formula] and by [formula] the subalgebra of [formula] generated by [formula]. In a similar manner, [formula] is the subalgebra of [formula] generated by [formula] and [formula] is the subalgebra of [formula] generated by [formula].

Representation theory of quantised enveloping algebras

It is well-known that the representation theory of the quantised enveloping algebra [formula] is analogous to the representation theory of the classical enveloping algebra [formula]. In this section, we collect the properties that will be needed in the rest of the paper.

As usual, if M is a left [formula]-module, we denote its dual by M*. Observe that M* is a right [formula]-module in a natural way. However, by using the antipode of [formula], this right action of [formula] on M* can be twisted to a left action, so that M* can be viewed as a left [formula]-module.

Let M be a [formula]-module and m∈M. The element m is said to have weight λ∈P if Ki.m = q(λ,αi)m for all [formula]. For each λ∈P, set

[formula]

If Mλ  ≠  0 then Mλ is said to be a weight space of M and λ is a weight of M.

It is well-known, see, for example [\cite=bg] [\cite=jantzen], that, for each dominant weight λ∈P+, there exists a unique (up to isomorphism) simple finite dimensional [formula]-module of highest weight λ that we denote by V(λ). In the following proposition, we collect some well-known properties of the V(λ), for λ∈P+. We refer the reader to [\cite=bg], [\cite=humphreys] and [\cite=jantzen] for details and proofs.

Denote by Ω(λ) the set of those weights μ∈P such that V(λ)μ  ≠  0.

[formula]

The weights of V(λ) are given by Weyl's character formula. In particular, if μ∈Ω(λ), then wμ∈Ω(λ) for all w∈W.

For all w∈W, one has [formula].

V(λ)*≃V( - w0λ).

The weight w0λ is the unique lowest weight of V(λ). In particular, for all μ∈Ω(λ), one has w0λ  ≤  μ  ≤  λ.

Ω(λ) = {λ  -  wμ|w∈Wμ∈P+μ  ≤  λ}.

For all w∈W and λ∈P+, let uwλ denote a nonzero vector of weight wλ in V(λ). Then we denote by V+w(λ) the Demazure module associated to the pair λ,w, that is:

[formula]

We also set

[formula]

(Observe that these definitions are independent of the choice of uwλ because of Proposition [\ref=irreductible] (3).)

The following result may be well-known; however, we have been unable to locate a precise statement.

V+w0(λ) = V(λ) = V-id(λ).

For all [formula], one has

[formula]

and

[formula]

We only prove the assertions corresponding to "positive" Demazure modules, the proof for "negative" Demazure modules is similar.

Since w0λ is the lowest weight of V(λ), we have [formula]; that is, V+w0(λ) = V(λ). This proves the first assertion.

In order to prove the second claim, we distinguish between two cases.

First, let [formula] with i  ≠  j. Then si(ϖj) = ϖj. Hence, in this case, one has: [formula].

Next, let [formula]. Then sj(ϖj) = ϖj  -  αj. Let μ∈Ω(ϖj) with μ  ≠  w0ϖj, and let m∈V(ϖj)μ be any nonzero element. It follows from the first assertion that there exists [formula] such that m = x.uw0ϖj. The element x can be written as a linear combination of products [formula], with [formula] and [formula]. Naturally, one can assume that [formula] for each such product. Let [formula] be one of these products. Since w0π =  - π, there exists [formula] such that w0αik =  - αl. We will prove that l = j. Indeed, assume that l  ≠  j. Since Eik.uw0ϖj is a nonzero vector of V(ϖj) of weight w0ϖj  +  αik, we get that

[formula]

Then, we deduce from Proposition [\ref=irreductible] that

[formula]

that is,

[formula]

Further, since we have assumed that l  ≠  j, we get slϖj  =  ϖj, so that

[formula]

This contradicts the fact that ϖj is the highest weight of V(ϖj).

Thus, we have just proved that w0αik =  - αj for all products [formula] that appear in x. Now, observe that Eik.uw0ϖj is a nonzero vector of V(ϖj) of weight w0ϖj  +  αik = w0(ϖj + w0αik) = w0(ϖj  -  αj) = w0sjϖj. Since [formula], we get that Eik.uw0ϖj  =  auw0sjϖj for a certain nonzero complex number a. Hence we get that

[formula]

where [formula] denote some nonzero complex numbers and [formula]. Thus m∈V+w0sj(ϖj). This shows that

[formula]

As the reverse inclusion is trivial, this finishes the proof.

Quantised coordinate rings of semisimple groups and their prime spectra.

Let G be a connected, simply connected, semisimple algebraic group over [formula] with Lie algebra [formula]. Since [formula] is a Hopf algebra, one can define its Hopf dual [formula] (see [\cite=josephbook]) via

[formula]

The quantised coordinate ring Oq(G) of G is the subalgebra of [formula] generated by the coordinate functions cλξ,v for all λ∈P+, ξ∈V(λ)* and v∈V(λ), where cλξ,v is the element of [formula] defined by

[formula]

see, for example, [\cite=josephbook]. As usual, if ξ∈V(λ)*η and v∈V(λ)μ, we write cλη,μ instead of cλξ,v. Naturally, this leads to some ambiguity. However, when μ∈W.λ and η∈W.( - w0λ), then dim (V(λ)μ) = 1 =  dim (V(λ)*η), so that this ambiguity is very minor.

It is well-known that Oq(G) is a noetherian domain and a Hopf-subalgebra of [formula], see [\cite=bg] [\cite=josephbook]. This latter structure allows us to define the so-called left and right winding automorphisms (see, for instance, [\cite=bg] or [\cite=josephbook]), and then to obtain an action of the torus [formula] on Oq(G) (see [\cite=bgtrans]). More precisely, observe that the torus [formula] can be identified with [formula] via:

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] with [formula]. Then, it is known (see [\cite=hlt] or [\cite=bg]) that the torus H acts rationally by [formula]-algebra automorphisms on Oq(G) via:

[formula]

for all g = (g1,g2)∈H = H  ×  H, λ∈P+, ξ∈V(λ)*μ and v∈V(λ)η. (We refer the reader to [\cite=bg] for the definition of a rational action.)

As usual, we denote by Spec(Oq(G)) the set of prime ideals in Oq(G). Recall that Joseph has proved [\cite=josephjalgebra] that every prime in Oq(G) is completely prime.

Since H acts by automorphisms on Oq(G), this induces an action of H on the prime spectrum of Oq(G). As usual, we denote by H-[formula] the set of those primes ideals of Oq(G) that are H-invariant. This is a finite set since Brown and Goodearl [\cite=bgtrans] (see also [\cite=bg]) have shown using previous results of Joseph that

[formula]

where

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

Since q is transcendental, it follows from [\cite=josephcras] that it is enough to consider the fundamental weights in the definition of Q+w+ and Q-w-. More precisely, we deduce from [\cite=josephcras] the following result.

[formula]

where

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

Moreover the prime ideals Qw+,w-, for (w+,w-)∈W  ×  W, are pairwise distinct.

Oq(G) is a noetherian UFD.

In this section, we prove that Oq(G) is a noetherian UFD (We refer the reader to [\cite=llr] for the definition of a noetherian UFD; the key point is that each height one prime ideal should be generated by a normal element.) In order to do this, we proceed in three steps.

First, by using results of Joseph, we show that there exist a finite number of nonzero normal H-eigenvectors [formula] of Oq(G) such that each 〈ri〉 is (completely) prime, and that each nonzero H-invariant prime ideal of Oq(G) contains one of the ri. This property may be thought of as a "weak factoriality" result: Oq(G) is an H-UFD in the terminology of [\cite=llr].

Secondly, by using the H-stratification theory of Goodearl and Letzter (see [\cite=bg]), we show that the localisation of Oq(G) with respect to the multiplicative system generated by the ri is a noetherian UFD.

Finally, we use a noncommutative analogue of Nagata's Lemma (see [\cite=llr]) to prove that Oq(G) itself is a noetherian UFD.

Oq(G) is an H-UFD

This aim of this section is two-fold. First, we show that for each [formula], the ideal generated by the normal element cϖi-  ϖi,w0ϖi or cϖi- w0ϖi,ϖi is (completely) prime and then we prove that every nonzero H-invariant prime ideal of Oq(G) contains either one of the cϖi-  ϖi,w0ϖi or one of the cϖi- w0ϖi,ϖi.

Let [formula]. Then Qw0,siw0  =  〈cϖi -   ϖi,w0ϖi〉 and Qw0si,w0  =  〈cϖi -  w0ϖi,ϖi〉.

Recall that

[formula]

where

[formula]

[formula]

Next, it follows from Proposition [\ref=demazure](1) that V+w0(ϖj) = V(ϖj) for all j, so that Q+w0 = (0). Also, we deduce from Proposition [\ref=demazure](2) that V-si(ϖj) = V(ϖj) if j  ≠  i, and [formula]. Hence,

[formula]

that is, Q-siw0  =  〈cϖi -   ϖi,w0ϖi〉. Therefore Qw0,siw0  =  Q+w0 + Q-siw0  =  〈cϖi -   ϖi,w0ϖi〉, as desired.

The second claim of the lemma is obtained in the same way.

Now observe that, in [\cite=josephbook], Joseph uses slighty different conventions for the dual M* of a left [formula]-module. Indeed, it is mentioned in [\cite=josephbook] that the dual M* is viewed with its natural right [formula]-module structure. As a consequence, Joseph's convention for the weights of the dual L(λ)* of L(λ), for λ∈P+, is not exactly the same as our convention. In particular, the elements cϖiϖi,w0ϖi and cϖiw0ϖi,ϖi, [formula], that appear in [\cite=josephbook], correspond to the elements cϖi-  ϖi,w0ϖi and cϖi- w0ϖi,ϖi in our notation. With this in mind, it follows from [\cite=josephbook] that the elements cϖi-  ϖi,w0ϖi and cϖi- w0ϖi,ϖi, for [formula], are normal in Oq(G). Thus we deduce from Lemma [\ref=generatorheightoneHprimes] the following result which will allow us later to use a noncommutative analogue of Nagata's Lemma in order to prove that Oq(G) is a noetherian UFD.

The 2n elements cϖi-  ϖi,w0ϖi and cϖi- w0ϖi,ϖi, for [formula], are nonzero normal elements of Oq(G) and they generate pairwise distinct completely prime ideals of Oq(G).

Since the cϖi-  ϖi,w0ϖi and cϖi- w0ϖi,ϖi, for [formula], are H-eigenvectors of Oq(G), in order to prove that Oq(G) is an H-UFD in the sense of [\cite=llr], it only remains to prove that every nonzero H-invariant prime ideal of Oq(G) contains either one of the cϖi-  ϖi,w0ϖi or one of the cϖi- w0ϖi,ϖi. This is what we do next.

Let [formula], with [formula]. Then [formula] contains either one of the cϖi-  ϖi,w0ϖi, or one of the cϖi- w0ϖi,ϖi.

Since [formula], either w+  ≠  w0, or w-  ≠  w0. Assume, for instance, that w+  ≠  w0, so that there exists [formula] such that w+  ≤  w0si. One can easily check from the definition of [formula] that this forces cϖi- w0ϖi,ϖi∈Q+w+, so that

[formula]

as required.

As a consequence of Corollary [\ref=Hfacto] and Lemma [\ref=inclusion], we get the following result.

Oq(G) is an H-UFD.

Theorem [\ref=joseph] establishes that [formula]. Note that Qw+,w-  =  0 precisely when w+  =  w-  =  w0. Thus, Corollary [\ref=Hfacto] and Lemma [\ref=inclusion] show that each nonzero H-prime ideal of Oq(G) contains a nonzero H-prime of height one that is generated by a normal H-eigenvector. Thus, Oq(G) is an H-UFD.

Oq(G) is a noetherian UFD.

Set T to be the localisation of Oq(G) with respect to the multiplicatively closed set generated by the normal H-eigenvectors cϖi-  ϖi,w0ϖi and cϖi- w0ϖi,ϖi, for [formula]. Then the rational action of H on Oq(G) extends to an action of H on the localisation T by [formula]-algebra automorphisms, since we are localising with respect to H-eigenvectors, and this action of H on T is also rational, by using [\cite=bg]. The following result is a consequence of Corollary [\ref=HUFD] and [\cite=llr].

The ring T is H-simple; that is, the only H-ideals of T are 0 and T.

We are now in position to show that Oq(G) is a noetherian UFD.

Oq(G) is a noetherian UFD.

By [\cite=llr], it is enough to prove that the localisation T is a noetherian UFD. Now, as proved in Proposition [\ref=t-is-hsimple], T is an H-simple ring. Thus, using [\cite=bg], T is a noetherian UFD, as required.

As a consequence, we deduce from Theorem [\ref=oqgufd] and [\cite=cj] the following result.

Oq(G) is a maximal order.

The fact that Oq(G) is a maximal order can also be proved directly by using a suitable localisation of Oq(G), [\cite=josephbook], which is itself a maximal order.
