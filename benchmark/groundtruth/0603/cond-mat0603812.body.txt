Comment on a Phys. Rev. Lett. paper: the origin of the excited state in LaCoO3

In a recent paper Phelan et al. [\cite=1] claim that the excited state in LaCoO3 is the intermediate-spin (IS) S=1 state of a t52ge1g configuration.

By this Comment we would like to correct this claim. We would expect that the problem of the excited state in LaCoO3 has been clarified in a year of 2003 in our paper [\cite=2], making use of experimental results of Noguchi et al. [\cite=3], but authors of the commented paper likely did not notice this paper. They have cited our first paper about LaCoO3 from a year of 1999 in Ref. 22 - in fact this paper dealt with the splitting of of the 5D term, belonging to the high-spin t42ge2g (S=2) state, by the trigonal distortion in the presence of the spin-orbit coupling.

In Ref. [\cite=2] we have proved that the excited state (quasi-triplet) originates from the 5T2g subterm of the 5D term belonging to the HS t42ge2g (S=2) configuration. We have perfectly reproduced the magnetic-field behaviour of the quasi-triplet and the anisotropic g factor experimentally revealed by Noguchi et al. [\cite=3]. The ground state is a many-electron subterm 1A1 originating from the 1I term, which in the free Co3 + ion lies 4.45 eV above the ground term 5D. The 13-fold degenerated 1I term is split by the octahedral crystal field and the subterm 1A1 is strongly pushed down, by relatively strong crystal field, due to its very large orbital quantum number L=6, as occurs on the Tanabe-Sugano diagram for Dq/B=2.025.

The IS state as the first excited state has been introduced to the LaCoO3 problem in year of 1996 by band calculations of Korotin et al. [\cite=4] as an opposite view to the atomistic view being a base for the Tanabe-Sugano diagrams known from years of 1954. The Tanabe-Sugano diagram for the 3d6 configuration has yielded the excited state to be the HS state and this view was the base for a model of Goodenough. The IS-state concept has become highly popular [\cite=5] [\cite=6]. In the band calculations of Korotin et al. the IS state becomes the first excited state as an effect of the especially strong d - p hybridization. However, we claim that if at present, in a year of 2006, one wants to still claim that the IS state is an excited state has to present a quantitative band-based or hybridization-based interpretation of the Noguchi et al. experiment. In the atomic physics t52ge1g (S=1) state is 24-fold degenerated - thus there is a question about a degeneracy left in LaCoO3 and its characteristics.

In the ionic atomistic (QUASST) picture the discrete atomiclike electronic structure is preserved also in transition-metal solid. For instance, the meV-scale splitting of the 15-fold degenerated 5T2g subterm by trigonal distortion in the presence of the spin-orbit coupling has been presented in Ref. [\cite=2] for LaCoO3 and for the Fe2 + ion in FeBr2. We note that the meaning and the degeneracy of the LS, IS and HS states in the band picture is understood differently than in the ionic (QUASST) picture. Thus, we think that the basic problem of LaCoO3 is associated with a consideration of d states as localized (ionic, QUASST) or as delocalized forming a wide energy ~  10 eV band like in Ref. 4 and to settle down the d occupation/valency of 6/+3 or 7.3/+1.7. Within the localized picture the estimation of the strength of the octahedral crystal-field interactions is decisive.

In conclusion, we claim that the origin of the excited state in LaCoO3 has been already established to be the high-spin state in agreement with the Tanabe-Sugano diagram.
