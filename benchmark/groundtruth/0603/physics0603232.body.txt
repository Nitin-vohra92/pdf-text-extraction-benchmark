Long-range interactions for He(n  S)-He(n'  S) and He(n  S)-He(n'  P)

In our previous paper [\cite=jzd02], we presented precise calculations of long-range interaction coefficients C3, C6, C8, C9, and C10 between two helium atoms in the 2  3 S and 2  3 P states and the finite nuclear mass effects for like isotopes. The purpose of this Brief Report is to extend our calculations to include interactions between all S - S and S - P states of the energetically lowest five states: He(11S), He(23S), He(21S), He(23P) and He(21P). These coefficients are useful in studying ultracold collisions between two helium atoms [\cite=cohen], as well as in serving as a benchmark for other computational methods.

For two like isotope helium atoms a and b, where one is in S state and the other in L state with the associate magnetic quantum number M, the zeroth-order wave function for the combined system ab can be written in the form [\cite=yan96]:

[formula]

where Ψna is the S-state wave function, Ψnb is the L-state wave function, [formula] and [formula] represent the coordinates of two helium atoms, C is the normalization factor, and β describes the symmetry due to the exchange of two atoms. If two atoms are both in a same S state, C is [formula] and β is zero. If they are in different states, C is 1 and β is ±  1.

At large internuclear distances R, the Coulombic interaction operator [\cite=yan96] between two atoms can be expanded as an infinite series in powers of 1 / R

[formula]

where

[formula]

[formula] and T(L)-  μ() are the atomic multipole tensor operators defined by

[formula]

and

[formula]

where Qi and qj are the charges on particles i and j. The coefficient [formula] is

[formula]

and [formula].

For all S - S systems and for S - P systems with atoms in different spin symmetries, the first order of perturbation theory vanishes and the second-order perturbation in Vop gives rise to the following long-range interaction potential

[formula]

where C6(M,β), C8(M,β), and C10(M,β) are the dispersion coefficients. For resonant S - P systems, where two atoms are in a same spin state, the long-range interaction potential is

[formula]

where C3(M,β) is from the first-order energy correction, C6(M,β), C8(M,β), and C10(M,β) are from the second-order energy correction, and C9(M,β) is from the third-order energy correction [\cite=jzd02]. The detailed expressions for Cn and their evaluation in Hylleraas coordinates can be found in [\cite=jzd02].

Tables [\ref=g1] and [\ref=g2] present dispersion coefficients C6, C8, and C10 for all six He(n  λS)-He(n'  λ'S) systems with n and n'  =  1,2 and, λ and λ'  =  1,3. In Table [\ref=g1], we also include the revised values of the dispersion coefficients [\cite=yan96] [\cite=yanbabb] for He(1  1 S)-He(1  1 S), He(2  1 S)-He(2  1 S), and He(2  3 S)-He(2  3 S) for the case of infinite nuclear mass, with some improvement, particularly for C6. Bishop and Pipin [\cite=bishop93] calculated the dispersion coefficients for the system ∞   He(1  1 S)-∞   He(2  3 S). Their results in atomic units are C6 = 29.082914, C8 = 1700.2700, and C10 = 136380.30, which are in agreement with ours at the level of 1, 45, and 10 ppm respectively.

Table [\ref=g3] shows the contributions to C6(M,β) from different symmetries of intermediate states for He(n  λS)-He(n'  λ'P), except for He(1  1 S)-He(2  3 P) and He(2  3 S)-He(2  3 P), which have been reported in [\cite=sadeg2] and [\cite=jzd02] respectively. From this table, one can see that the contributions from doubly-excited (pp)P configurations are much smaller than the contributions from singly-excited S and D configurations. It is also interesting to note that only the contributions to C6(M,   ± ) from the symmetries (  1 P,  3 S) are negative for ∞   He(2  1 S)-∞   He(2  3 P). This is because the dominant transitions 2  1 S-2  1 P and 2  3 P-2  3 S make large negative contributions - 10935.32650 and - 2733.831626 for C6(0,   ± ) and C6( ±   ,   ± ), respectively. For the symmetries (  3 P,  1 S) for ∞   He(2  3 S)-∞   He(2  1 P), the dominant transitions 2  3 S-2  3 P and 2  1 P-2  1 S contribute 10935.32650 and 2733.831626 for C6(0,   ± ) and C6( ±   ,   ± ), respectively. The mainly negative contributions are from the pair of transitions 2  3 S-2  3 P and 2  1 P-1  1 S whose values - 6.150732811 and - 1.537683203 for C6(0,   ± ) and C6( ±   ,   ± ), respectively, are much smaller than those from the corresponding dominant and positive transitions.

Table [\ref=g4] lists C3(M,   ± ), C6(M,   ± ), C8(M,   ± ), C9(M,   ± ), and C10(M,   ± ) for the He(n  λS)-He(n'  λ'P) systems except for the He(2  3 S)-He(2  3 P) system [\cite=jzd02]. For C3(M,   ± ), our results agree with Drake's values [\cite=drake]. To our knowledge, there are no other published calculations on the dispersion coefficients for the He(n  λS)-He(n'  λ'P) system.
