On the logarithmic Kobayashi conjecture

We study the hyperbolicity of the log variety [formula], where X is a very general hypersurface of degree d  ≥  2n + 1 (which is the bound predicted by the Kobayashi conjecture). Using a positivity result for the sheaf of (twisted) logarithmic vector fields, which may be of independent interest, we show that any log-subvariety of [formula] is of log-general type, give a new proof of the algebraic hyperbolicity of [formula], and exclude the existence of maximal rank families of entire curves in the complement of the universal degree d hypersurface. Moreover, we prove that, as in the compact case, the algebraic hyperbolicity of a log-variety is a necessary condition for the metric one.

Introduction

A complex manifold V is hyperbolic in the sense of S. Kobayashi if the hyperbolic pseudodistance defined on V (see section 2 for precise definitions) is a distance. A necessary condition for the hyperbolicity of a complex manifold is the constancy of holomorphic maps from [formula] to V. Hyperbolic complex manifolds have been studied in the two following contexts. One is the hyperbolicity of a compact complex manifold, in which case, thanks to a criterion due to R. Brody [\cite=Bro], the above necessary condition is also sufficient to guarantee the hyperbolicity of V. The other is the hyperbolicity of a compact complex manifold with an ample divisor removed. In the case of complements of projective hypersurfaces we have the Kobayashi conjecture [\cite=Ko70]:

The complement [formula] of a general hypersurface [formula] of degree deg X  ≥  2n + 1, n  ≥  2, is hyperbolic.

Notice that the lower bound in Conjecture [\ref=c2] is sharp, since, as noticed first by M. Zaı denberg [\cite=Z], there exists a line intersecting a general degree 2n hyperpersurface in two points. (For the Kobayashi conjecture on the hyperbolicity of a general hypersurface of high degree, and the related results, we refer the reader to § 2.2).

In the present paper we study questions related to Conjecture [\ref=c2] (which is proved for n = 2 and d  ≥  15 in [\cite=E.G]), by extending to the logarithmic setting (part of) the techniques and ideas successfully used in the compact case.

Let [formula] be a variety with a normal crossing divisor D. The pair [formula] is called a log-variety. Let [formula] We denote by [formula] its log-cotangent bundle and by [formula] its log-canonical bundle. In the third section, in order to study the algebraic hyperbolicity properties of the log-variety [formula], where X is a very general hypersurface, we prove the following non-vanishing result.

Let X be a very general hypersurface of arbitrary degree d in [formula]. Let Y be a k-dimensional subvariety in [formula] meeting X properly, [formula] the induced divisor and [formula] a log-resolution of (Y,D) i.e [formula] is smooth, ν is a projective birational morphism and ν- 1(D) + Exc(ν) is a normal crossing divisor. Then

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the log-canonical bundle of the log-variety [formula].

In particular we deduce :

Let [formula] be a very general hypersurface of degree [formula]. Then any k-dimensional log-subvariety (Y,D) of [formula], for Y not contained in X, is of log-general type, that is, any log-resolution [formula] of (Y,D) has big log-canonical bundle [formula].

Let [formula] be a very general hypersurface of degree d  ≥  2n + 1, and [formula] a curve not contained in X. Then

[formula]

where [formula] is the normalization of C, [formula] its genus, and i(C,X) is the number of distinct points in ν- 1(X).

The inequality in Corollary [\ref=cor2] has been previously proved by Xi Chen in [\cite=ch01] by means of a delicate degeneration argument (see also [\cite=V2], Theorem 3.10, where it is proved that any C intersects a general hypersurface of degree d = 2n - 2 + r, r  ≥  3, in at least r points, as well as [\cite=ch00] and [\cite=Xu] for the case n = 2). Note that, as a consequence, one gets that there is no entire curve [formula] in the complement of a very general hypersurface of degree [formula], if the Zariski closure [formula] is an algebraic curve. Notice moreover that both Corollaries [\ref=cor1] and [\ref=cor2] are sharp: the latter by the result of Za ı denberg we have quoted above, and the former by a natural generalization of Za ı denberg's result, which we present at the end of § 3.

In the fourth section we prove that, as one expects, the hyperbolicity of a log-variety implies its algebraic hyperbolicity, thus answering a question raised by Xi Chen in [\cite=ch01].

Let [formula] be a projective manifold and [formula] an effective divisor on [formula] such that [formula] is hyperbolic and hyperbolically imbedded. Let ω be a hermitian metric on X. Then there exists ε > 0 such that for every compact irreducible curve C  ⊂  X with [formula] where [formula] is the normalization of C, [formula] its genus and [formula]

In the last section we strenghten the conclusion of Corollary [\ref=cor2], and prove that there is no entire curve, varying in a family of maximal rank, in the complement of a general hypersurface of degree at least 2n + 1, without assumptions on the Zariski closure of the entire curve.

Let [formula] be an étale cover of an open subset of [formula], and let [formula] be a holomorphic map such that [formula] for all t∈U. If d  ≥  2n + 1, the rank of Φ cannot be maximal anywhere.

The above theorem is of course a consequence of Conjecture [\ref=c2], and represents the logarithmic analog of the main result of [\cite=DPP]. Again, by Za ı denberg's example, our result is sharp, as for d = 2n one can consider the family of the exponential maps associated to the family of lines [formula] intersecting the hypersurface Xt in two points :

[formula]

We denote by [formula] the family of degree d hypersurfaces. The proofs of Theorems [\ref=t1] and [\ref=maxrank] use the global generation of the sheaf of (twisted) vector fields on the log variety [formula] (see § 3, Proposition [\ref=prop1] for the precise statement). Once the logarithmic framework is set, our approach allows natural proofs, which are formally equal to those of the corresponding hyperbolicity properties of [formula]. In that sense, it unifies the compact and the logarithmic cases. Notice moreover that the analogous global generation result in the compact case is the first step in Y.-T. Siu's proof of the hyperbolicity of a very general hypersurface [formula], for d  ≫  n (see [\cite=SY04], Lemma 4, and [\cite=V'], Proposition 1.1). It seems then plausible that using a generalization of Proposition [\ref=prop1] to logarithmic jet bundles and following the strategy outlined in [\cite=SY04], one could prove Conjecture [\ref=c2] for very high degree : this has been done for n = 3 in [\cite=Rou06bis].

Preliminaries

Log-manifolds

Let [formula] be a complex manifold with a normal crossing divisor D. The pair [formula] is called a log-manifold. Let [formula] be the complement of D.

Following [\cite=Ii], the logarithmic cotangent sheaf [formula] is defined as the locally free subsheaf of the sheaf of meromorphic 1-forms on [formula] whose restriction to V is [formula] and whose localization at any point x∈D is given by where the local coordinates z1,...,zn around x are chosen such that D = { z1...zl = 0}.

Its dual, the logarithmic tangent sheaf [formula] is a locally free subsheaf of the holomorphic tangent bundle [formula] whose restriction to V is TV and whose localization at any point x∈D is given by

Recall that starting with an arbitrary divisor, Hironaka's theorem on resolution of singularities [\cite=Hi] guarantees that we can replace it by a normal crossing one after performing some blowing-ups.

Let V be an irreducible complex algebraic variety (possibly singular), and let D  ⊂  V be an effective Cartier divisor on V. There is a projective birational morphism where [formula] is non singular and μ has divisorial exceptional locus except(μ), such that is a normal crossing divisor.

One calls [formula] a log-resolution of (V,D).

Hyperbolicity and algebraic hyperbolicity

Let X be a complex manifold. We denote by f:Δ  →  X an arbitrary holomorphic map from the unit disk [formula] to X. The Kobayashi-Royden infinitesimal pseudo-metric [\cite=Ko70] on X is the Finsler pseudometric on the tangent bundle TX defined by The Kobayashi pseudo-distance dX, is the geodesic pseudodistance obtained by integrating the Kobayashi-Royden infinitesimal pseudometric. The manifold X is hyperbolic in the sense of S. Kobayashi if the hyperbolic pseudodistance defined on X is a distance.

Directly from the definition of the Kobayashi pseudo-distance one can see that if f:X  →  Y is a holomorphic map of complex manifolds then it is distance decreasing i.e for [formula] we have

As mentioned in the introduction, in the case of a general projective hypersurface X, both X and its complement are conjectured to be hyperbolic, as soon as the degree of X is high enough.

A general hypersurface [formula] of degree deg X  ≥  2n - 1 is hyperbolic.

(For n  ≥  4, the natural lower bound should be 2n - 2).

The most important confirmation of Conjecture [\ref=con1] has been obtained by Y.-T. Siu [\cite=SY04], who proved it for dn  ≫  n. As for the known lower bounds on the degree, Conjecture [\ref=con1] has been studied for n = 3 in [\cite=DEG00] and [\cite=MQ], where the bound d  ≥  21 (respectively d  ≥  36) has been obtained (in the recent preprint [\cite=Pau], this bound has been improved to d  ≥  18). In [\cite=Rou06], the second author proved a weak form of Conjecture [\ref=con1] for n = 4 and d  ≥  593.

It is widely believed that when dealing with a projective variety V, there should exist a property of algebraic nature equivalent to the hyperbolicity of V. In the compact case, Demailly (see [\cite=De95]) introduced the notion of algebraic hyperbolicity, and proved it is a necessary condition for the hyperbolicity. S. Lang proposed another property, namely the fact that any subvariety of V is of general type. Both properties have been checked for very general hypersurfaces of degree d  ≥  2n - 2, in [\cite=CR] and [\cite=P], building on ideas and techniques introduced by C. Voisin [\cite=V] (see also [\cite=Cle] and [\cite=Ein]).

In analogy to the compact case, Xi Chen [\cite=ch01] studied the notion of algebraic hyperbolicity, in the sense of Demailly, for log-manifolds.

Let (X,D) be a log-manifold. For each reduced curve C  ⊂  X that meets D properly, let [formula] be the normalization of C. Then i(C,D) is the number of distinct points in the set [formula]

A logarithmic variety (X,D) is algebraically hyperbolic if there exists a positive number ε such that for all reduced and irreducible curves C  ⊂  X meeting D properly where [formula] is the normalization of C, [formula] its genus and [formula] with ω a hermitian metric on X.

In the next section, we prove that the algebraic hyperbolicity in the sense of Demailly, as well as the algebraic property analogous to that proposed by Lang, hold for the complement of a very general projective hypersurface of degree at least equal to 2n + 1.

Algebraic hyperbolicity of the log variety [formula]

In this section we give the proof of theorem [\ref=t1], using logarithmic techniques, and the global generation of the sheaf of (twisted) logarithmic vector fields, which we now introduce.

Fix the following notations:

[formula] denotes the parameter space for degree d hypersurfaces in [formula].

[formula] denotes the universal hypersurface of degree d, and p and q the projections of [formula] onto the two factors.

[formula] is the hypersurface defined by the homogeneous polynomial [formula]

For a smooth hypersurface XF we have the corresponding logarithmic manifold [formula], with logarithmic tangent sheaf [formula] logarithmic cotangent sheaf [formula] and logarithmic canonical sheaf [formula]

The global generation result

We shall extend to the logarithmic setting an approach initiated by Clemens, Ein, Voisin and Siu (see [\cite=Cle], [\cite=Ein], [\cite=V], [\cite=SY04]):

The twisted logarithmic tangent bundle

[formula]

is generated by its global sections.

Let [formula] be the universal hypersurface of degree d given by the equation where [formula] and [formula] for [formula] [formula] and if Z = (Z0,...,Zn) are homogeneous coordinates on [formula] then [formula] Notice that X is a smooth hypersurface of bidegree (d,1) in [formula] We consider the log-manifold [formula]. Let us consider where [formula] and

[formula]

Consider the natural projection [formula] and set

[formula]

Therefore we obtain a dominant log-morphism [formula] which induces a map

Therefore we are reduced to prove that [formula] is generated by its global sections. Consider the open set U0  =  {Z0  ≠  0}  ×  U in [formula] with the induced inhomogeneous coordinates. The equation of Z on U0 becomes

Consider the vector field where [formula] [formula] if k  ≠  j and [formula] Notice that Vα,j is a logarithmic vector field of [formula] which extends to (Z,H) with a pole order equal to 1.

Consider a vector field where

[formula]

is linear in the variables zk, and [formula] We claim that there exists a logarithmic vector field tangent to Z0. Indeed, the condition to be satisfied is and the complex numbers vα are chosen such that the coefficient of zα in the above equation is equal to zero. This logarithmic vector field of (Z0,H0) extends to (Z,H).

The previous vector fields give the global generation of [formula]

Sharp algebraic hyperbolicity properties for [formula]

Having recorded in the previous subsection the needed positivity result, we can now prove Theorem [\ref=t1], together with its corollaries. We also show, in Example [\ref=example], that our results are sharp in the degree.

Let [formula] be the open subset parametrizing smooth hypersurface. We want to study families of k-dimensional irreducible subvarieties inside [formula], intersecting properly the family of hypersurfaces. So, eventually passing to an étale cover of U, we consider an irreducible subvariety [formula] such that the projection map Y  →  U is dominant of relative dimension k, and such that Y intersects properly X (and so does its generic fiber YF with XF). Let D  ⊂  Y the family of divisors induced by the intersections [formula]. Let [formula] be a log resolution of (Y,D) i.e [formula] is smooth and [formula] is a normal crossing divisor, and so is its general fiber [formula].

For general F∈U, and arbitrary degree d we want to produce a non zero element in [formula], where [formula]

We have:

[formula]

Indeed:

[formula]

and by the adjunction formula

[formula]

since the normal bundle of a fiber in a family is trivial.

Using standard linear algebra, we have:

[formula]

The generically surjective map [formula] induces a map

that is non zero for F general in U.

Recalling that

[formula]

and using ([\ref=adjunction]) and ([\ref=duality]), it is enough to show that is globally generated. To conclude, we notice that and invoke the global generation of [formula], that follows from Proposition [\ref=prop1].

Letting the family Y vary, that is, varying the Hilbert polynomial, we obtain that for F outside a countable union of proper closed subvarieties of U, all the k-dimensional subvarieties Y intersecting properly XF verify

[formula]

Let us now show how to deduce Corollaries [\ref=cor1] and [\ref=cor2].

By the above theorem, the logarithmic canonical bundle of [formula] may be written as the sum of the effective line bundle [formula] and the line bundle [formula]. The latter is big, as soon as d  ≥  2n + 2 - k, so the corollary is proved.

If [formula] is a curve intersecting properly the general hypersurface XF, [formula] its desingularization, [formula] the divisor given by the intersection with the hypersurface, and [formula], then by ([\ref=not0]) we have and we are done.

A further consequence is the following.

For a very general hypersurface X of degree d  ≥  2n + 1 in [formula] [formula] does not contain any algebraic torus [formula] Therefore a holomorphic map [formula] is constant if [formula] is contained in an algebraic curve.

We end the present section by discussing an example which generalizes [\cite=Z], and shows that also Corollary [\ref=cor1] is sharp.

Hyperbolicity and algebraic hyperbolicty of log varieties

In this section, we would like to answer a question raised by X. Chen in [\cite=ch01]:

Let [formula] be a projective manifold and [formula] an effective divisor on [formula]. Is it true that if [formula] is hyperbolic and hyperbolically imbedded then [formula] is algebraically hyperbolic?

The answer is positive. Namely we have theorem [\ref=t2].

To give a proof we need the following results.

First, we need a Gauss-Bonnet formula in the non compact case. We follow the approach of [\cite=Far] which we recall for the convenience of the reader. Let M be a Riemann surface. M is said to be of finite type if there exists a compact Riemann surface [formula] such that [formula] consists of finitely many points. The genus of M is defined as the genus of [formula].

A puncture of M is defined to be a domain D0  ⊂  M conformally equivalent to [formula] We will identify z = 0 with the puncture D0.

Recall that a Kleinian group G is a subgroup of PGL2 whose action on [formula] is discontinuous at some point and that a Kleinian group is called Fuchsian if there is a disc invariant under the action. Let G be a Fuchsian group acting on the unit disk Δ. Let {x1,x2,...,xn} be the set of points of Δ / G that are either punctures or ramified points of the projection π:Δ  →   Δ / G. Let νj be the ramification index of π- 1(xj) and set νj  =    ∞   for punctures. Let us assume that Δ / G is of finite type. If π is ramified over finitely many points, then we will say that G is of finite type over Δ. We let g be the genus of Δ / G. We can define the characteristic of G:

We can project the Poincaré metric [formula] on Δ / G which gives the hyperbolic metric of constant curvature - 1. We have the following theorems:

([\cite=Far], p.233) The area of Δ / G with respect to the hyperbolic metric is finite and

([\cite=Far], p.234) Let M be a Riemann surface and {x1,x2,...} a discrete sequence on M. To each point xk we assign an integer νk  ≥  2 or ∞  .

If [formula] we exclude two cases:

{x1,x2,...} consists of one point and ν1  ≠    ∞  .

{x1,x2,...} consists of two points and ν1  ≠  ν2.

Let [formula] Then there exists a simply connected Riemann surface [formula] a Kleinian group G of self mappings of [formula] such that

[formula]

the natural projection [formula] is unramified except over the points xk with νk  <    ∞   where the branch numbers verify [formula] for all [formula]

The third result we need is related to the notion of hyperbolic imbedding (see [\cite=Ko98]). Let Z be a complex manifold and Y a complex submanifold with compact closure [formula] Y is hyperbolically imbedded in Z if for every pair of distinct points p,q in [formula] there exist neighborhoods Up and Uq of p and q in Z such that [formula] which is equivalent to say that dY(pn,qn) cannot converge to zero when two sequences {pn} and {qn} in Y approach two distinct points p and q of the boundary [formula]

Let us prove the following proposition which is another version of Theorem 3.3.3 of [\cite=Ko98]:

Let Y be a relatively compact complex submanifold (i.e [formula] is compact) of a complex manifold Z. Then the following are equivalent:

Y is hyperbolically imbedded in Z.

Given a length function L on Z there is a positive constant ε such that kY  ≥  εL on Y.

Let us prove that (a) implies (b). If ε does not exist then, from the definition of the Kobayashi infinitesimal pseudometric, there exists a sequence {fn} of holomorphic functions from Δ to Y such that

Since [formula] is compact we may assume that {fn(0)} converges to a point [formula]

Let U be a complete hyperbolic neighborhood of p in Z. Assume that there exists a positive number r < 1 such that fn(Δr)  ⊂  U for n  ≥  n0. Then [formula] would be relatively compact and woud have a subsequence which converges to a holomorphic function from Δr to U, which contradicts [formula]

This means that for each positive integer k, there exist a point zk∈Δ and an integer nk such that [formula] and fnk(zk)∉U. Let pk = fnk(0) and qk  =   fnk(zk). By taking a subsequence we may assume that {qk} converges to a point q not in U. Therefore we have

and this contradicts the fact that Y is hyperbolically imbedded in Z.

Let us prove that (b) implies (a). Let δ be the distance function on Z induced by L. Then

which implies obviously that Y is hyperbolically imbedded in Z.

Now, we can prove Theorem [\ref=t2].

Let [formula] be the normalization and [formula] As [formula] is hyperbolic [formula] is hyperbolic and admits the unit disk as its universal cover [formula] Let [formula] be the hyperbolic metric of constant curvature - 1 with [formula] its area element. From the distance decreasing property of Kobayashi metrics and the previous proposition we have

Therefore from the preceding two theorems we have

Families of entire curves in the complement of the universal hypersurface.

The goal of this section is to prove that a family of entire curves in the complement of the universal degree d hypersurface [formula] cannot have maximal rank, as soon as d  ≥  2n + 1 (as predicted by the log Kobayashi conjecture). As in the compact case, which has been treated in [\cite=DPP], such a result points out to the lack of a good parameter space for entire curves. The proof goes exactly as in the compact case and relies on the global generation of the bundle [formula], proved in Proposition [\ref=prop1].

Let [formula] be an étale cover of the open subset parametrizing smooth hypersurfaces. As before, to render the notation less heavy we will simply write [formula]

Consider a holomorphic map [formula] over the base [formula].

As U is an open set, we can shrink it and suppose that it is equal to a polydisc [formula]. Consider the following sequence of maps

[formula]

given by [formula]. We will point out where the change of the radius of the disc is used in the proof.

If Φ1  =  Φ is of maximal rank, its Jacobian gives a nonzero section

[formula]

Let us assume that [formula] is nonzero in the corresponding vector space. Remark that, by construction, [formula], for any k  ≥  1, hence [formula] is not identically zero. Thanks to Proposition [\ref=prop1], we can choose (n - 1) logarithmic vector fields

[formula]

such that the sections

[formula]

are nonzero at the origin.

If q is the projection of [formula] on the parameter space [formula], then under the assumption d  ≥  2n + 1, the restriction of [formula] to q- 1(U) is ample (eventually after shrinking once again the open subset U), hence we can endow this bundle with a metric h of positive curvature.

For any [formula] set

[formula]

Notice that, by construction, there exists a positive number c such that for each k  ≥  1, we have

[formula]

On the other hand we have

For each k  ≥  1 we have fk()  ≤  C  ·  k- 2. In particular, as k  →    ∞  , we have fk()  →  0.

Theorem [\ref=maxrank] follows from the fact that ([\ref=f_k(0)]) and Proposition [\ref=tozero] contradict each other.

We now give the proof of Proposition [\ref=tozero], which is very close to that of the classical Ahlfors-Schwarz lemma.

First, notice that for each k  ≥  1, there exists a positive constant C such that we have

[formula]

pointwise over the polydisc [formula]. Indeed, by construction, the image of the map Φk lies inside q- 1(U), for each k  ≥  1, so that

[formula]

Hence we get

[formula]

and ([\ref=lowerbound]) is proved (the above relations are obtained using the vector inequalities

[formula]

Then, consider the volume form of the Poincaré metric on the polydisc

[formula]

A computation shows that

[formula]

(Remark that the previous inequality can be obtained precisely because, thanks to the reparameterization, we have the same radius δ0k for the components of the polydisc which is the domain of ψk.)

Consider the function [formula]. Its maximum cannot be achieved at a boundary point of the domain, since ψk goes to infinity as (z,ξ) goes to the boundary. So at the maximum point (z0,ξ0), we have

[formula]

This inequality, combined with ([\ref=lowerbound]) and ([\ref=upperbound]), gives

[formula]

Since the relation (5) is verified at the maximum point of the quotient, the same is true at an arbitrary point, thus, in particular, at the origin:
