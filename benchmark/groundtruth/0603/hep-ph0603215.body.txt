Vus From Hadronic τ Decays

Background

Three-family unitarity of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix implies

[formula]

with the Vub contribution playing a numerically negligible role [\cite=pdg04]. Analyses of [formula] incorporating recent updates to the KL lifetime [\cite=kloekllifetime], the K+ [\cite=e86503], KL [\cite=klbrs] and Ks [\cite=kloeks06] branching fractions, and the [formula] form factor slope parameters [\cite=ke3slopes], together with strong isospin-breaking and long distance electromagnetic corrections computed in the framework of ChPT [\cite=longdistemetc], lead to [\cite=ckmwg1]

[formula]

which, with the Leutwyler-Roos estimate, f+(0) = 0.961  ±  0.008 [\cite=lr84] (compatible within errors with recent quenched and unquenched lattice results [\cite=latticefzero]), yields [\cite=ckmwg1]

[formula]

This result is in good agreement with expectations based on unitarity and the most recent update of the average of superallowed 0+  →  0+ nuclear β decay [\cite=hardy04] and neutron decay [\cite=abele02] results, |Vud| = 0.9738  ±  0.0003 [\cite=ckmwg1]. The ~  2σ discrepancy observed when earlier K decay results were employed thus appears finally to have been resolved. One should, however, bear in mind two recent developments relevant to |Vud|: (i) a new measurement of the neutron lifetime, in strong disagreement with the previous world average [\cite=serebrov04], and (ii) a Penning trap measurement of the Q value of the superallowed [formula] decay [\cite=savard05] in significant disagreement with the average used as input in Ref. [\cite=hardy04], and with the potential to raise doubts about current evaluations of structure-dependent isospin-breaking corrections [\cite=hardy05]. The potentially unsettled |Vud| situation makes alternate (non-[formula]) determinations of |Vus| of interest, both as a means of testing the Standard Model (SM) scenario for strangeness-changing interactions, and for reducing errors through averaging. Two such alternate methods have been proposed recently.

In the first, |Vus / Vud| is extracted using lattice results for fK / fπ in combination with experimental results for Γ[Kμ2]  /  Γ[πμ2] [\cite=marciano04]. With the recently updated MILC nf = 3 unquenched lattice result, fK / fπ  =  1.198+ .016- .006 [\cite=milc05], the first method yields

[formula]

compatible within errors with the [formula] determination.

The second of these proposals involves the analysis of flavor-breaking sum rules employing strange and non-strange hadronic τ decay data [\cite=pichetalvus], and forms the subject of the rest of this paper. Existing results, based on the "(0,0) spectral weight" version of this analysis, will be discussed as part of the development below. The discussion to follow represents an update and extension of the preliminary results presented in Ref. [\cite=krmtau04].

Vus From Hadronic τ Decay Data

With Π(J)V / A;ij the spin J parts of the flavor ij = ud,us vector/axial vector correlators, ρ(J)V / A;ij the corresponding spectral functions, and [formula], the kinematics of hadronic τ decay imply [\cite=bnpetc]

[formula]

where yτ = s / m2τ, Vij is the flavor ij CKM matrix element, SEW = 1.0201  ±  0.0003 [\cite=erler02] is a short-distance electroweak correction, and the superscript (0 + 1) denotes the sum of J = 0 and J = 1 contributions. Eq. ([\ref=basictaudecay]) is written in such a way that both terms on the RHS can be rewritten using the general finite energy sum rule (FESR) relation,

[formula]

valid for any analytic weight w(s) and any correlator Π without kinematic singularities. Quantities R(k,m)V / A;ij, analogous to RV / A;ij, are obtained by rescaling the experimental decay distribution with the factor (1 - yτ)kymτ before integrating. The corresponding FESR's are referred to as the "(k,m) spectral weight sum rules". Similar FESR's can be written down for general weights w(s), for s0 < m2τ, and for the separate correlator combinations Π(0 + 1)V / A;ij(s) and sΠ(0)V / A;ij(s). The corresponding spectral integrals, [formula], will be denoted Rwij(s0) in what follows. In FESR's involving both the J = 0 + 1 and J = 0 combinations, the purely J = 0 contribution will be referred to as "longitudinal".

With this background, the τ-based extraction of Vus works schematically as follows [\cite=pichetalvus]. Given experimental values for the spectral integrals Rwij(s0), ij = ud,us, corresponding to the same w(s) and same s0, the combination

[formula]

vanishes in the SU(3) flavor limit and hence has an OPE representation, δRwOPE(s0), which begins at dimension D = 2. Solving for |Vus|, one has

[formula]

At scales ~  2 - 3 GeV2, and for weights used in the literature, the dominant D = 2 term in δRwOPE(s0) is much smaller than the leading D = 0 contribution and, as a consequence, similarly smaller than the separate ud, us spectral integrals (for physical ms, typically at the few to several percent level). The OPE uncertainty, [formula], thus produces a fractional |Vus| error [formula], much smaller than the fractional uncertainty on δRwOPE(s0) itself. High accuracy for |Vus| is thus obtainable with only modest accuracy for δRwOPE(s0) provided experimental spectral integral errors can be kept under control.

At present, the absence of a V/A separation of the us spectral data means one must work with sum rules based on the observed V+A combination. This combination also reduces the fractional ud spectral integral errors. With present ud spectral data [\cite=cleoud95] [\cite=alephud98] [\cite=opalud99], these errors are at the ~  0.5% level for weights used previously in the literature. The much smaller strange branching fraction leads to limited statistics and coarser binning for the us spectral distribution [\cite=alephus99] [\cite=cleous0305] [\cite=opalus04]. The K pole term is very accurately known, but errors are ~  6 - 8% in the K* region and > 20 - 30% above 1 GeV2. For weights used in the literature, the result is us spectral integrals with ~  3 - 4% uncertainties [\cite=alephus99] [\cite=chen01] [\cite=opalus04]. Experimental errors on |Vus| are thus at the ~  1.5 - 2% level, and dominated by uncertainties in the us sector. The situation should improve dramatically with the increase in statistics and improved K identification available from the B factory experiments.

A number of points relevant to reducing OPE errors are outlined below. Note that use of the V+A sum rules has the added advantage of strongly suppressing duality violation at the scales considered [\cite=krmtau02]. Working with weights satisfying w(s = s0) = 0 further suppresses such contributions [\cite=krmtau02] [\cite=krmpfesr], as does working at scales s0 > 2 GeV2 [\cite=cdgmudvma].

A major, and irreducible, source of OPE uncertainty for "inclusive" sum rules (those involving both J = 0 + 1 and J = 0 contributions) is that produced by the bad behavior of the integrated longitudinal D = 2 OPE series. This representation displays badly non-convergent behavior, order by order in αs, even at the maximum scale, s0 = m2τ, allowed by kinematics [\cite=longitudinalconvergence]. Moreover, for the (k,0) spectral weights, those truncations of this series employed in the literature can be shown to strongly violate constraints associated with the positivity of the continuum (non-K-pole) part of ρ(0)V + A;us(s) [\cite=positivityviolation].

The impossibility of making sensible use of the longitudinal OPE representation necessitates working with sum rules based on the J = 0 + 1 combination. Since no complete J = 0 / 1 spin separation of the spectral data exists, a phenomenological subtraction of the longitudinal parts of the experimental decay distribution is necessary. This can be done with good accuracy because the (very accurately known) π and K pole terms dominate the subtraction, for a combination of chiral and kinematic reasons [\cite=krmtau02] [\cite=kmms00]. Small continuum us longitudinal corrections have been constrained phenomenologically, by a sum rule analysis of the flavor us pseudoscalar channel [\cite=mkps01] and a coupled-channel dispersive analysis of the scalar channel which employs experimental Kπ phases, ChPT, and short-distance QCD constraints as input [\cite=jopss]. The contribution of the resulting phenomenological longitudinal continuum us model to the τ strangeness branching fraction (corresponding to the (0,0) spectral weight, and s0 = m2τ) is < 1% of the total. The uncertainty in the bin-by-bin continuum longitudinal subtraction thus plays a minor role, even for the (0,0) spectral weight. Dominance of the longitudinal us continuum by the K*0(1430) and K(1460) resonance contributions also means the impact of longitudinal subtraction uncertainties on the resulting J = 0 + 1 spectral integrals decreases rapidly with decreasing s0 and is much reduced for weights (like the (k > 0,0) spectral weights) which fall off to zero faster at s = s0 than does the (0,0) spectral weight.

For the remainder of this paper, we focus on the flavor-breaking combination

[formula]

OPE Input

The OPE representation of ΔΠ is known up to dimension D = 6.

The leading, D = 2, term is given by [\cite=bck05]

[formula]

where ā  =  αs(Q2) / π and s = ms(Q2), with ms(Q2) and αs(Q2) the running strange quark mass and coupling in the [formula] scheme. The O(ā4) term [\cite=bck05] was estimated using methods which provided an extremely accurate prediction for the O(ā3) coefficient, and similarly reliable predictions of the nf-dependent O(ā3m2q) coefficients of the electromagnetic current correlator [\cite=bckzin04], all in advance of their explicit calculation. For ā and s, we employ exact solutions corresponding to the 4-loop-truncated β and γ functions [\cite=betagamma4], with initial conditions for ms [\cite=pdg04] and αs [\cite=alephud98]

[formula]

The forms of the D = 4 and D = 6 contributions are well known, and may be found in Ref. [\cite=bnpetc]. The dominant D = 4 contribution is that proportional to the RG-invariant strange quark condensate. This is evaluated using ChPT quark mass ratios [\cite=leutwylerqm], GMOR for the light quark condensate, and the conventional estimate [formula] for the ratio of the two condensates. D = 6 contributions are evaluated using the vacuum saturation approximation (VSA) and assigned an error of ±  500%. D > 6 terms are assumed negligible. This assumption can be tested for self-consistency since, for polynomial weights, [formula] (with y = s / s0), integrated D = 2m + 2 OPE contributions scale as 1 / sm0. Neglected, but non-negligible, D > 6 contributions will thus show up as unphysical instabilities in the output of a given sum rule (in this case, |Vus|) with respect to s0. Since, when [formula], the D = 2m + 2 contribution to δRwOPE(s0) is unsuppressed by any additional factors of αs, an s0-stability test is particularly important for weights, w(y), having D > 6 OPE contributions potentially enhanced through large values for one or more of the cm with m > 2. The (2,0), (3,0) and (4,0) J = 0 + 1 spectral weights, w(2,0)(y) = 1 - 2y - 2y2 + 8y3 - 7y4 + 2y5, w(3,0)(y) = 1 - 3y + 10y3 - 15y4 + 9y5 - 2y6, and w(4,0)(y) = 1 - 4y + 3y2 + 10y3 - 25y4 + 24y5 - 11y6 + 2y7, are examples of weights having such large higher order coefficients.

The D = 2 OPE integrals are evaluated using the CIPT prescription [\cite=ciptbasic], in which the RG-improved expression for ΔΠ, or its Adler function ΔD(Q2)    =     - Q2dΠ(Q2) / dQ2, is used point-by-point along the integration contour. To all orders, the two versions of the D = 2 integral are necessarily equal, being related by a partial integration. With both ΔΠ and ΔD truncated at the same order, however, they differ by terms of higher order in ā. Our central values employ the O(ā4)-truncated RG-improved correlator version (for arguments in favor of this choice, see Ref. [\cite=bck05]).

For the scales employed in this study, both the magnitude and error of δRwOPE(s0) are dominated by the D = 2 contribution. The D = 2 error has two important sources. The first is an overall scale uncertainty, associated with the error on the input strange quark mass, s(2 GeV). This uncertainty is ~  50% for the PDG04 input, Eq. ([\ref=4loopics]), but should be reduced considerably by ongoing progress in unquenched lattice simulations. The second source of error is the truncation of the D = 2 series.

The D = 2 truncation error is potentially significant because the series in Eq. ([\ref=d2form]) is slowly converging near the spacelike point on the FESR contour. In fact, with high-scale determinations of αs(MZ) [\cite=pdg04] corresponding to an nf = 3 coupling ā(Q2 = m2τ)≃0.10 - 0.11, the last three terms in Eq. ([\ref=d2form]) are actually slowly increasing with order at the spacelike point throughout the whole of the kinematically allowed region. Convergence of the integrated series will thus typically be slow for weights which emphasize this part of the contour. The (k,0) spectral weights, which involve 2 + k powers of 1 - y, fall more and more into this category as k is increased, since, on the contour (y = eiθ), [formula] is more and more peaked in the spacelike direction.

We will use two different monitors of the convergence of the integrated D = 2 series. The first involves the difference of the truncated correlator and Adler function versions of the series, the second the stability with respect to s0 of the sum rule output.

For a series with good convergence, the correlator and Adler function versions of the truncated sum should be in good agreement and, moreover, show improved agreement with increasing truncation order. We define rwk(s0) to be the fractional change in the relevant integrated order-k-truncated D = 2 sum produced by shifting from the correlator to corresponding Adler function version. Large values of |rwk(s0)| and/or an increase of |rwk(s0)| with k then signal slow convergence of the D = 2 series [\cite=warningfootnote]. We will take twice the sum, in quadrature, of the last included term and the difference between the truncated correlator and Adler function versions of the sum as our estimate for the D = 2 truncation error. The resulting estimate is considerably more conservative than those used previously in the literature.

Regarding s0 stability, a truncated series well-converged at s0 = m2τ should remain so for some range of s0 < m2τ. Since the exact δRw(s0) would produce a |Vus| independent of s0, a well-converged truncation of the integrated D = 2 OPE series should produce |Vus| values stable over some interval of s0. If, however, neglected higher order terms are actually important at s0 = m2τ, they will be even more so at lower scales, making the accuracy of the truncated expression even worse at those scales, and producing an unphysical s0 dependence to the extracted |Vus| [\cite=convs0stabfootnote]. The absence of a stability window in s0 thus implies the unreliability of the truncated integrated D = 2 series and/or the importance of neglected, but non-negligible, higher dimension terms.

Data Input

For the ud data we use the ALEPH spectral distribution and covariance matrix [\cite=alephud98], with overall normalization corrected for the small changes in the e, μ, and strangeness branching fractions subsequent to the original ALEPH publication.

For the us data, we have, unfortunately, been unable to obtain the covariance matrix from the OPAL collaboration. The OPAL publication [\cite=opalus04] quotes correlated us spectral integral errors only for a range of the (k,m) spectral weights, and only for s0 = m2τ. This information is insufficient to allow the errors resulting from other choices for either s0 or w(y) to be inferred, precluding implementation of the crucial s0-stability test, even for the (k,0) spectral weights. We have thus chosen to work with the somewhat older ALEPH data [\cite=alephus99], whose covariance matrix is publicly available. The two data sets differ mainly in the values of a small number of the strange branching fractions, a particularly important difference being that for τ-  →  K-π+π-ντ. To take into account the changes in the branching fraction values, we follow the strategy adopted in Ref. [\cite=alephetal01]. In this approach, the ALEPH distribution for each mode is rescaled by the ratio of the current world average to the ALEPH 1999 branching fraction value. The resulting rescaled mode-by-mode distributions are then recombined to form the modified total us V+A spectral distribution [\cite=thankstoshaomin]. This scheme should be reliable for modes whose rescalings are close to 1, but is less clearly so for those, like τ-  →  K-π+π-ντ, where this is not the case.

The us K pole spectral integral contribution is fixed by the Γ[Kμ2]-based SM prediction. This is done because (i) the SM prediction is compatible with the observed τ  →  Kντ branching fraction, but ~  6 times more precise, and (ii) Eq. ([\ref=tauvussolution]) already pre-supposes the validity of the SM mechanism for hadronic τ decays.

There exist three determinations of the branching fraction [formula], the original ALEPH result, 0.214  ±  0.037  ±  0.029%, and the more recent CLEO and OPAL results, 0.384  ±  0.014  ±  0.038% and 0.415  ±  0.059  ±  0.031%, respectively. While the CLEO and OPAL results are in good agreement, the agreement with ALEPH is less compelling. The OPAL us spectral integral results employed the three-fold average, 0.330  ±  0.028%, in setting the overall normalization of the K-π+π- spectral distribution. Results based on this normalization are denoted 'ACO' below. To stress the sensitivity to apparently minor changes in the branching fraction values, as well as the importance of improved precision, we also present results (denoted 'CO' in what follows) corresponding to the alternate rescaling, produced by the average, 0.40%, of the OPAL and CLEO central values. The 'ACO'/'CO' branching fraction difference, though only 0.07%, represents more than 2% of the ~  3% total strangeness branching fraction and hence has the potential to shift |Vus| by as much as ~  1% (~  0.0020).

Analysis and Results

In this section we first discuss the existing (0,0) spectral weight analysis, then present alternate determinations, based on weights with improved s0-stability for |Vus|.

The (0,0) Spectral Weight Determination of Vus

The (0,0) spectral weight has been proposed in the literature as a particularly favorable case for the |Vus| analysis [\cite=pichetalvus]. A key potential advantage is the very close cancellation between the weighted ud and us spectral integrals. This manifests itself in the OPE representation in suppressed values for the integrated D = 2 OPE series and hence similarly suppressed values for the ms-induced D = 2 scale uncertainty. This scale uncertainty is the dominant component of the estimated theoretical error in Ref. [\cite=pichetalvus], being a factor of ~  2 larger than the estimated D = 2 truncation uncertainty, and much larger than any of the other contribution. The combined theory error, ±  0.0009 [\cite=pichetalvus], is swamped by the current ±  0.0033 experimental error, but, if reliable, would make the (0,0) analysis a very favorable one for use in determining |Vus| once the much improved us spectral data from BABAR and BELLE becomes available. Unfortunately, as we will see below, the theoretical uncertainty on δR(0,0)OPE(m2τ) almost certainly significantly exceeds the estimate of Refs. [\cite=pichetalvus]. Indeed, we will argue that the convergence of the integrated D = 2 (0,0) spectral weight series is sufficiently bad that the (0,0) analysis is, in fact, an unfavorable one for the extraction of |Vus|. Fortunately, alternatives exist with significantly improved convergence behavior, which allow one to take advantage of the general approach proposed in Refs. [\cite=pichetalvus]. We return to these in the next subsection, after elaborating on the problematic features of the (0,0) analysis.

The (0,0)-spectral-weight-based results of Refs. [\cite=pichetalvus] were obtained using the O(ā3)-truncated Adler function version of the integrated D = 2 OPE series. The truncation error was estimated by combining the magnitude of the last (O(ā3)) included term in quadrature with a measure of the residual scale dependence, the latter obtained by changing the CIPT scale choice μ2 = Q2 to μ2  =  ξQ2, with 0.75 < ξ < 1.5. The resulting truncation uncertainty is + 10%- 20% of the O(ā3)-truncated Adler function sum. The results of Ref. [\cite=bck05], however, show that the truncated sum is decreased by 47% if evaluated instead using the O(ā4) integrated correlator form. This shift is larger by a factor of nearly 2.5 than the truncation error estimate of Refs. [\cite=pichetalvus].

Further evidence for the slow convergence of the integrated D = 2 (0,0) series is provided by the values of r(0,0)k(m2τ), given in Table [\ref=table1]. The values are not small in general, and grow rapidly with increasing k. This increase raises serious doubts about any truncation error estimate based on features of the O(ā4)-truncated sum, even one, like ours, which is more numerically conservative than that of Refs. [\cite=pichetalvus].

A final illustration of the unreliability of the convergence of the integrated D = 2, (0,0) spectral weight series is provided by the s0-stability results, shown in columns 2 (ACO case) and 6 (CO case) of Table [\ref=table2]. No stability window for |Vus| is evident in either case, as expected given the indications for poor convergence already discussed above. The level of instability is much larger than the total theory error estimated in Refs. [\cite=pichetalvus], even if we restrict our attention to the upper half of the interval displayed in the table.

Alternate Weight Choices

From Refs. [\cite=bck05] [\cite=kmms00] it is clear that the integrated J = 0 + 1, D = 2 OPE series for the (k,0) spectral weights display rather unfavorable convergence behavior, making such weights problematic for use in extracting |Vus|. Although (k,0) spectral weights occur frequently in treatments of hadronic τ decay data, one should bear in mind that one of the primary reasons for their introduction, namely the possibility of using them in inclusive analyses, is entirely negated by the necessity of avoiding inclusive analyses, which follows from the extremely bad behavior of the integrated longitudinal OPE representation.

In Ref. [\cite=kmms00], the possibility of constructing weights more suitable for use in J = 0 + 1 non-inclusive sum rules was investigated. These weights were chosen to (i) emphasize contributions from regions of the contour showing improved convergence for the D = 2 ΔΠ series, (ii) suppress contributions from the region of the spectrum above ~  1 GeV2 where us spectral errors are large, and (iii) control the size of higher order coefficients which might otherwise enhance D > 6 contributions. Three such weights, w10, ŵ10, and w20 [\cite=w20footnote], were constructed, all having profiles on the timelike axis intermediate between those of the J = 0 + 1, (0,0) and (2,0) spectral weights, and hence similarly intermediate relative us spectral integral errors. The much improved D = 2 convergence, compared to that of the (k,0) spectral weights, is shown explicitly in Ref. [\cite=kmms00]. Further evidence for this improvement is contained in Table [\ref=table1], which shows good agreement, improving with increasing truncation order, between the correlator and Adler function versions of the truncated D = 2 sums. The contrast to the (0,0) spectral weight case is striking.

As s0 is decreased, terms in the integrated D = 2 series of O(āk), with k > 4, grow in size relative to the leading 0th order term. This growth is least rapid for w20 and most rapid for w10. Though the coefficients multiplying these terms in ΔΠ are not known, this nonetheless indicates that stability for the improved D = 2 convergence will be best for w20 and worst for w10. The rw10k(s0) values in fact display a cross-over in sign and increase in magnitude with increasing k  ≤  4 below s0  ~  2.55 GeV2, signalling probable deteriorating convergence. We thus base our final results on the highest available scale, s0 = m2τ, and favor the ŵ10 and w20 analyses over that based on w10.

Results

Much improved s0 stability is observed for the weights with improved D = 2 convergence, particularly w20 and ŵ10. Contributions to the errors on |Vus| for the various weights are given in Table [\ref=table3] [\cite=datafootnote]. Sources contributing <  0.0003 theoretical uncertainty for all weights considered are not listed explicitly but are included in the total theoretical error. Since the results for our favored weights, w20 and ŵ10, are in excellent agreement, and the combined errors are minimized for the latter, we take as our final determination the ŵ10 results. Displaying the larger of the asymmetric theory errors, the ACO (CO) us data treatments yield the following results, both compatible, within errors, with those of Eqs. ([\ref=vuske3]) and  ([\ref=marcianovus]):

[formula]

Conclusions

We have shown that the values of |Vus| extracted using the (0,0) spectral weight sum rule display a sizeable instability with respect to s0. This instability, combined with the results of Ref. [\cite=bck05], strongly suggests that the true D = 2 truncation uncertainty is much larger than previously estimated. Given the level of instability, even our much more conservative estimate, shown in row 1 of Table [\ref=table3], seems far from being overly conservative. We see no plausible way of obtaining a reliable, but more restrictive, estimate of this uncertainty. The D = 2 truncation error thus represents a sizeable, and irreducible, limitation on the accuracy of the (0,0) spectral weight determination of |Vus|.

In contrast, for the weights ŵ10, w20 and w10 (whose integrated D = 2 series, by design, display improved convergence), good consistency, and much improved s0-stability, is found. At present the theoretical errors on |Vus| for these weights, shown in Table [\ref=table3], are dominated by the ms-scale uncertainty. Near-term improvements in unquenched lattice simulations should significantly reduce this error. A determination of ms(2 GeV) to ±  5 MeV, for example, would reduce the combined ŵ10 theory error to ±  0.0013, bringing a sub-1% determination of |Vus| easily within reach with the improved B factory data. Note that ŵ10 would be favored over w20 because of its smaller truncation error.

It is also possible to construct weights having, simultaneously, improved D = 2 convergence and reduced ms-scale sensitivity. We have generated a number of such weights, but find they typically weight the region of the spectrum above 1 GeV2 more strongly than do those weights discussed above. As a result, with current us data, they produce very large experimental errors, and are not presently useful. We will report on these weights elsewhere, once the improved us B factory data has become available and meaningful stability tests can be performed.
