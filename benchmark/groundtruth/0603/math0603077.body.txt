Lp and weak L1 estimates for the maximal Riesz transform and the maximal Beurling transform

Corollary Lemma Definition Note

Introduction

Let T be a classical Calderón-Zygmund singular integral operator on [formula] with smooth kernel K and let [formula] be the associated maximal singular integral

[formula]

where Tεf(x) is the truncation at level ε

[formula]

In this note we consider the problem of controlling [formula] by Tf. The control we seek is in terms of Lp and weak L1 estimates and we restrict our attention to the Riesz and Beurling transforms. In the forthcoming paper [\cite=MPV] one considers pointwise estimates and more general kernels.

The j-th Riesz transform, 1  ≤  j  ≤  n, is the singular integral operator

[formula]

The principal value integral above exists for all x if f is a compactly supported smooth function and one shows for such functions the Lp estimate

[formula]

for some positive constant C independent of f. Then a bounded operator Rj can be defined on Lp by the obvious density argument. A subtle issue arises when one tries to show that the principal values in [\eqref=eq1] exist for almost all x in [formula] for each function f in Lp. Following a well known principle, one looks for an Lp estimate for the maximal Riesz transform [formula] and one indeed proves that

[formula]

For the classical results just mentioned one may consult [\cite=Du] or [\cite=St]. Our first result improves the last inequality.

One may wonder whether [\eqref=eq2] still holds in the limiting case p = 1 and the answer is provided by our next result.

Notice that the above statement is not obvious even for the Hilbert transform, which is the case n = 1. The surprising fact is that the weak L1 inequality does hold for the Beurling transform.

The Beurling transform is the singular integral in the plane [formula] defined by

[formula]

where dA denotes 2-dimensional Lebesgue measure. The Beurling transform is invertible on [formula], 1 < p <   ∞  , and the inverse is the singular integral with kernel [formula]. Thus [formula], and consequently, [formula]. Hence inequality [\eqref=eq2] with Rj replaced by B is trivially true for 1 < p <   ∞  . Incidentally, let's remark that the same can be said about [\eqref=eq2] for n = 1, because the Hilbert transform is invertible on Lp, 1 < p <   ∞  .

Therefore, there is an astonishing difference between even and odd kernels. This phenomenon will be further studied in [\cite=MPV]. One should not think that Theorem [\ref=T3] is due to an extremely special property of the Beurling transform. Indeed, it can be shown that it holds for a significant class of even kernels, although it is not yet clear to the authors what are the best possible assumptions one should require.

Taking into account the classical estimate [formula] Theorem 3 entails

[formula]

Notice that there are functions [formula], [formula], such that [formula] is as small as desired. On the other hand, one can also find a function [formula] with [formula] and [formula] very small. Thus neither the inequality in Theorem 3 nor the classical weak L1 estimate for [formula] is stronger than the other.

In the next three sections we will provide the proofs of the above three theorems. We adhere to the standard convention of denoting by C a positive constant, independent of the relevant parameters involved, and which may vary from an occurrence to another. Our notation and terminology are standard. For example, A≃B means that the two quantities A and B satisfy the relation C- 1A  ≤  B  ≤  CA, for some constant [formula].

The problem considered in this paper arose when the second named author was working on the question, still open, of whether the Riesz kernels characterize uniform rectifiability in dimensions greater than 1 (see [\cite=DS]; see also [\cite=Ve] for a survey about the one dimensional problem and related results).

The authors are grateful to Carlos Pérez for an illuminating conversation which lead to Theorem [\ref=T2].

Proof of Theorem 1

In this section we may assume that n  >  1, because the result is obviously true in dimension 1. Let M be the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator. It is enough to prove that for each s > 1 there exists a positive constant Cs such that

[formula]

Let B denote the unit ball centered at the origin, Bc its complement in [formula] and let [formula] be the kernel of the j-th Riesz transform.

There exists a function h such that

[formula]

As it is well known

[formula]

in the distributions sense. Consider the function φ that takes the value 1 on B and 1 / |x|n - 1 on Bc . Since φ is continuous on the boundary of B, we have, in the distributions sense,

[formula]

Taking the Fourier transform one sees that for an appropriate constant cn one has

[formula]

Therefore [\eqref=eq3] follows by taking the j-th derivative of φ and setting, for another suitable constant cn,

[formula]

Set

[formula]

We have to show that

[formula]

By translation and dilation invariance we can assume, without loss of generality, that x = 0 and ε  =  1. Then We will see below that [formula], but h has not an integrable decreasing radial majorant. To overcome this difficulty we split the last integral into two pieces

[formula]

To estimate the term I1 notice that h belongs to Lq(2B) for 1  ≤  q  <    ∞  . This follows from [\eqref=eq4], because the functions χBc  Ki are in [formula] for 1 < q, and the Ri are bounded on [formula] if 1 < q <   ∞  . Thus, if s' denotes the exponent conjugate to s, by Holder's inequality we obtain

[formula]

The term I2 can easily be estimated if we first prove that

[formula]

Indeed, the preceding decay inequality yields

[formula]

which is not greater than [formula] by Holder's inequality.

To prove [\eqref=eq5] express h / cn as

[formula]

If |x| > 1 we have Since

[formula]

we obtain, for |x|  ≥  2,

[formula]

which gives [\eqref=eq5] and completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=T1].

Proof of Theorem 2

We prove Theorem [\ref=T2] for j = 1. Set [formula] and [formula] and let μ be the length measure on the segment joining a and b. For an appropriate constant cn we have

[formula]

as one can easily see by taking Fourier transforms on both sides. For n = 1 one should replace [formula] by log |x| in the formula above. We have

[formula]

Set

[formula]

so that

[formula]

Let φ be a non-negative continuously differentiable function with compact support contained in the unit ball B such that [formula], and set

[formula]

Convolving the identity [\eqref=eq6] with φε we obtain

[formula]

Let fε stand for [formula], so that

[formula]

Now

[formula]

and [formula] is a compactly supported function in [formula] with zero integral. Thus [formula] is a function in the Hardy space [formula] (in fact,  it is a multiple of an atom) and so [formula]. Hence we only need to show that

[formula]

for some constant C  ≥  1 and for sufficiently small positive ε.

Recall from Lemma [\ref=lem4] that there is a function h such that R1(h) = χBcK1. Dilating we get R1(hδ) = χ(δB)cK1, where [formula] and δB is the ball of radius δ centered at the origin. Therefore and, convolving with φε,

[formula]

To go further we need to understand the singularity of h.

We have, for some constant c0,

[formula]

where |b(x)|  ≤  C, [formula], and

[formula]

σ being the n - 1 dimensional surface measure on the unit sphere.

Assume first that |x| < 1. Let [formula]. Apply Green-Stokes to the domain 1 < |x| < R and then let R  →    ∞   to obtain

[formula]

for some constants c1 and c2. Thus, with other constants c3 and c4,

[formula]

Now, the form [formula] is invariant by rotations and so, understood as a measure, is a constant multiple of dσ. To complete the proof of the lemma we only need to show that the second term in the right hand side of the preceding identity is a bounded function of x. This is very easy if we split the domain of integration into two parts according to whether |x - y| < 1 or |x - y| > 1. We then get

[formula]

If |x| > 1 the argument is basically the same except that one has to delete a small ball centered at x before applying Green-Stokes and then let the radius tend to zero. We again get the identity [\eqref=eq9], where now the Riesz transforms really involve principal values.

The next simple lemma describes precisely the singularity of the potential p(x). Denote by d(x) = ||x| - 1| the distance from x to the unit sphere {|x| = 1}.

We have

[formula]

provided [formula].

Take x such that [formula] and set

[formula]

If N is chosen appropriately, then

[formula]

There exists a constant [formula] such that, for sufficiently small ε > 0 we have

Assume first that δ = 1 and that [formula] . For each y in the ball B(x,ε) one has d(y)  ≤  d(x)  +  ε  ≤  3ε, and so

[formula]

which is not greater than [formula] if ε is small enough.

If [formula], then

[formula]

Consider now an arbitrary positive δ. Then

[formula]

Since

[formula]

the lemma follows.

We proceed now to prove [\eqref=eq7]. Consider the cone K with vertex at b, aperture [formula] and with axis the positive x1-axis. In other words,

[formula]

Take x∈K and set δ  =  |x - b|. We are going to apply the second inequality in Lemma [\ref=lem7] with x replaced by x - a. Thus we have to check that

[formula]

The second inequality is obvious if we assume δ  ≥  4, because then [formula]. A simple estimate based on the fact that x∈K shows that [formula] and thus the first inequality in [\eqref=eq10] holds provided that [formula]. Using [\eqref=eq8], Lemma [\ref=lem6] and Lemma [\ref=lem7], we obtain Since [formula],

[formula]

which is greater than or equal to

[formula]

because log δ  ≥   log 4  >  1. Since

[formula]

provided

[formula]

we conclude that

[formula]

for ε so small that [formula]

Denote by |E| the Lebesgue measure of the set E. By [\eqref=eq11], for small ε we obtain If ε is such that

[formula]

then we get

[formula]

Taking ε small enough we can further assume that [formula]. Therefore

[formula]

which yields

[formula]

and completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=T2].

Proof of Theorem 3

Theorem [\ref=T3] follows from the pointwise inequality

[formula]

Let's remark, incidentally, that the preceding estimate is an improvement of Cotlar's inequality for the Beurling transform

[formula]

because the term Mf(z) does not appear in the right hand side of [\eqref=eq12].

To prove [\eqref=eq12] we first show the formula

[formula]

where D is the disc of center 0 and radius 1. Let

[formula]

be the Cauchy transform of the function f, so that

[formula]

in the distributions sense.

Consider the function F(z) which takes the value [formula] on D and the value [formula] on Dc. Then

[formula]

Notice that F = C(χD), because F - C(χD) is an entire function vanishing at ∞  . Thus [\eqref=eq13] holds.

Hence Dilating and translating one obtains

[formula]

and, consequently, [\eqref=eq12].
