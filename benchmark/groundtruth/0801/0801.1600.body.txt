A Most General Edge Elimination Polynomial -- Thickening of Edges

Introduction

We consider the following three-variable graph polynomial which has been introduced by I. Averbouch, B. Godlin, and J. A. Makowsky [\cite=agm_most_general_edge_elimination]:

[formula]

where G = (V,E) is a graph with multiple edges and self loops allowed, [formula] denotes a vertex-disjoint union of edge sets A and B, [formula] is the number of components of [formula], and kcov(B) is the number of components of (V(B),B).

The polynomial ξ simultaneously generalizes two interesting graph polynomials: the Tutte polynomial and a bivariate chromatic polynomial P(G;x,y) defined by K. Dohmen, A. Pönitz, and P. Tittmann [\cite=dpt_chromatic].

It is known that the Tutte polynomial of a graph with "thicked" edges evaluated at some point equals the Tutte polynomial of the original graph evaluated at another point (parallel edge reduction). This property can be used to prove that at almost every point evaluating the Tutte polynomial is hard [\cite=jaeger_vertigan_welsh] [\cite=sokal-2005] [\cite=blaes_mak] [\cite=bdm].

In Section [\ref=sec:p2p] of this note we observe that edge thickening has a similar effect on ξ as on the Tutte polynomial (Theorem [\ref=thm:p2p]). In Section [\ref=sec:xi_hard] we conclude that for every point [formula], except on a set of dimension at most 2, it is -hard to compute ξ(G;x,y,z) from G (Theorem [\ref=thm:xi_hard]). This supports a difficult point conjecture for graph polynomials [\cite=makowsky_zoo], [\cite=agm_most_general_edge_elimination].

A point-to-point reduction from thickening

In this section we apply Sokal's approach to ξ and obtain Lemma [\ref=lem:psi_thick] (cf. [\cite=sokal-2005]), the main technical contribution of this note.

We define the following auxiliary polynomial, which has a different y-variable for each edge of the graph,  = (ye)e∈E(G).

[formula]

where

[formula]

We write ψ(G;x,y,z) for ψ(G;x,,z) if for each e∈E(G) we have ye = y.

We have the polynomial identities ψ(G;x,y,zx- 1y- 1) = ξ(G;x,y,z) and ξ(G;x,y,zxy) = ψ(G;x,y,z).

Let G be a graph and e∈E(G) an edge. Let [formula] and Gee be the graph G with e doubled, i.e. [formula] with e1,e2 being new edges.

ψ(Gee;x,,z) = ψ(G;x,,z) with Ye = (1 + ye1)(1 + ye2) - 1 and Yẽ = yẽ for all ẽ∈E'.

Let [formula] and [formula]. We define a map τ:M(G)  →  2M(Gee) in the following way. Consider (A,B)∈M(G). If [formula], we set τ(A,B) = {(A,B)}. If e∈A, we let [formula] and define [formula]. (Note that in this case [formula], as A and B are vertex-disjoint.) If e∈B, we let [formula] and define [formula]. Observe that

[formula]

and that this union is a union of pairwise disjoint sets.

Calculation yields

[formula]

for every (A,B)∈M(G). Thus,

[formula]

Applying Lemma [\ref=lem:psi_thick] repeatedly and Lemma [\ref=lem:psi_xi] to convert between ψ and ξ we obtain

Let Gk be the k-thickening of G (i.e. the graph obtained out of G by replacing each edge by k copies of it). Then

[formula]

Hardness

The following theorem has been proven independently by I. Averbouch (J. A. Makowsky, personal communication, October 2007).

Let P denote the bivariate chromatic polynomial defined by K. Dohmen, A. Pönitz, and P. Tittmann [\cite=dpt_chromatic]. For every [formula], y  ≠  0, [formula], it is -hard to compute P(G;x,y) from G.

Given a graph G = (V,E) let [formula] denote the graph obtained out of G by inserting a new vertex ṽ and connecting ṽ to all vertices in V. Let P(G;y) denote the chromatic polynomial [\cite=read_chromatic]. It is well known that

[formula]

From this and [\cite=dpt_chromatic] we can derive

[formula]

The proof of the theorem now works in the same fashion as a proof that P(G;y) is -hard to evaluate almost everywhere using [\eqref=eq:chrom_p2p] would work: using [\eqref=eq:dpt_p2p] we reduce along the lines x = y + d, which eventually enables us to evaluate P at (1 + d,1) (if y is a positive integer, we reach (1 + d,1) directly; otherwise we obtain arbitrary many points on the line x = y + d, which enables us to interpolate the polynomial on this line). On the line y = 1 the polynomial P equals the independent set polynomial [\cite=dpt_chromatic], which is -hard to evaluate almost everywhere [\cite=averbouch_makowsky] [\cite=bh_interlace].

For every [formula], x  ≠  0, z  ≠   - xy, [formula], [formula], the following statement holds true: It is -hard to compute ξ(G;x,y,z) from G.

For [formula], x,y  ≠  0 and [formula] the following problem is -hard by Theorem [\ref=thm:DPT_hard]: Given G, compute

[formula]

where the first equality is by [\cite=agm_most_general_edge_elimination] and the second by Lemma [\ref=lem:psi_xi]. We will argue that, for any fixed [formula], this reduces to compute [formula] from G. We have

[formula]

by Lemma [\ref=lem:psi_xi]. An easy calculation converts the conditions on x,,y into conditions on x,y,z and yields the statement of the theorem.

Now assume that we are able to evaluate ψ at some fixed [formula], i.e. given G we can compute ψ(G;x,y,z). Then Theorem [\ref=thm:p2p] allows us to evaluate ψ at (x,y',z) for infinitely many different y' = (1 + y)k - 1 provided that |1 + y|  ≠  0 and |1 + y|  ≠  1. As ψ is a polynomial, this enables interpolation in y and eventually gives us the ability to evaluate ψ at (x,y',z) for any [formula]. In particular, being able to evaluate ψ at [formula], [formula], implies the ability to evaluate it at [formula].
