Hartmann flow with Braginsky viscosity: a test problem for ICM plasma

Introduction

Gasdynamical interactions of magnetized flows in the cores of clusters of galaxies play an important role in formation of the observed morphological structures, e.g.  through expansion of AGN blown bubble into ICM medium and resulting plasma heating, and interaction of two gas components in merging clusters [\cite=MarkevitchVikhlinin07]. Majority of theoretical work on these topics has been numerical, mostly using the existing fluid and MHD codes, like ZEUS. Unfortunately, simple hydrodynamic models "face multiple failures" [\citep=Reynolds05] for cluster cores. Perhaps, the most evident example is the Raleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities of AGN blown bubbles, which disrupt the bubbles approximately on one rise time [\citep=Kaiser05]. On the other hand, artificial fiddling with viscosity (which is usually parametrized with respect to [\cite=Braginsky] value; this procedure is not justified in ICM [\citep=Schekochihin05] [\citep=lyutikov07]), shows that "modest" changes of shear viscosity lead to qualitatively different results [\citep=Reynolds05] [\citep=Sijacki].

One of principal reasons, perhaps, for the failure of simple MHD codes is that they use isotropic viscosity, while ICM plasma is strongly gyrotropic, in a sense that it is weakly collisional, rL  ≪  λ  ≤  L (rL is ion Larmor radius, λ is mean free path and L is a typical size of the system), and weakly magnetized, kinetic pressure p is much larger than magnetic pressure, β  =  8πp / B2  ≫  1 (B is a typical magnetic field ). In ICM the ion Larmor radius rL  ~  108 - 9 cm is many orders of magnitude smaller than the mean free path λ  ~  1022 - 23 cm and the size L  ~  1024 cm, while β  ~  100 [\citep=ct02].

In a strongly gyrotropic plasma the local transport properties, primarily viscosity and conductivity, become anisotropic [\citep=Braginsky]. The effects of anisotropic viscosity and conductivity are expected to change substantially the results of ICM simulations. As a simple example, note that magnetic field  drapes around the contact surface separating the two interacting media [\citep=lyutikov07]. In a strongly gyrotropic plasma the shear viscosity inside the draping layer, with a flow along magnetic field  lines, then becomes 0. This runs contrary to the idea that high viscosity may provide stabilization [\cite=Reynolds05]. (Note that draping itself can provide stabilization against KH instability, in a way similar to the effect of a thin oil layer on water waves [\citep=Dursi07]).

Understanding the basic properties of strongly gyrotropic plasma is imperative for further progress, especially for parametrization of the 'sub-grid' physics in large numerical simulations. In this Letter we adapt one of the basic solutions of MHD, a Hartmann flow [\citep=LLVIII], to the case of anisotropic viscosity.

Hartmann flow with anisotropic viscosity

Consider a one-dimensional (along x direction) flow of a weakly collisional plasma between two plates located at z =   ±  a with a superimposed external magnetic field  (generally, oblique). This is meant to represent a boundary layer during interaction of two plasma flows in the ICM. In the Chew-Goldberger-Low (zero Larmor radius and neglecting heat fluxes) approximation [\citep=Chew] the equations of resistive plasma flow read [\citep=Kulsrud]:

[formula]

where η0 is the first Braginsky coefficient [\citep=Braginsky], resistivity ηr is a tensor and [formula] is a unit vector along magnetic field . We also absorbed a factor [formula] into definition of magnetic field ,

Assuming that all quantities are independent of x and y, from div[formula] we find Bz  =  const  =  B0. Introducing Bx  =  B0f(z), vx = v, the x component of Euler equation gives

[formula]

[formula] is constant pressure gradient driving the flow, ΔP is a drop in pressure over the length L. Eq ([\ref=eq1]) can be integrated once:

[formula]

Integration constant z0 is a point where f = 0.

Assuming that the y component of magnetic field  vanishes, so that current flows across magnetic field  [formula], the resistivity equation gives:

[formula]

Here [formula] is resistivity across magnetic field . Finally, eliminating v' from Eq. ([\ref=eq2]) using Eq. ([\ref=v]), we get equation for f:

[formula]

This is the main equation which determines the structure of the flow. In case of anisotropic viscosity it's a nonlinear equation. It differs from the case of isotropic viscosity [\citep=LLVIII] by a different viscosity term:

[formula]

Renormalizing, z  →  za,  z0  →  z0a and introducing α  =  (B20  /  ΔP)(L / a), we find

[formula]

where

[formula]

we identify as Hartmann number.

Boundary conditions are somewhat tricky in our case. From the continuity of the tangential magnetic field  (assuming there is no surface current) and from the symmetry of the flow, it is required that f = f0 at z =   ±  a and f = 0 at the point z0, where f0 is an imposed longitudinal magnetic field . Below we consider a case when there is no superimposed longitudinal magnetic field, f0 = 0 and z0 = 0.

On the other hand, at surfaces where [formula] (at the boundaries and in the middle) there is no viscosity, see Eq. ([\ref=main]), so the usual conditions of v = 0 at z =   ±  a need not to be satisfied. Thus, in principle, the flow may slip along the boundaries and have a discontinuity in the middle. This will make the problem unsolvable as the order of the ODE would be higher than the number of boundary conditions.

In fact, it is necessary to assume some floor for viscosity to get a physically meaningful solution of Eq. ([\ref=main]) even if we just impose condition f = 0 at z =   ±  a. Near points f = 0, Eq. ([\ref=main]) reduces to f = (z - z0) / α. So that derivative of f at these points has a definite sign, given by the parameter α. Thus, f cannot be zero more than once. Since f = 0 in middle of the layer, this would clearly violate the conditions that parallel magnetic field  vanishes on the walls.

Introducing resistivity floor fr in Eq. ([\ref=main]) by substitution f2  →  f2  +  fr, we can integrate Eq. ([\ref=main]) numerically, see Fig.([\ref=Fig1]). For sufficiently small values of this viscosity floor the final result is independent of its exact value, Fig. ([\ref=comparefr]).

The somewhat unphysical value of [formula] can be expressed in terms of bulk velocity in the middle of the layer v0:

[formula]

This gives [formula], where we identified the ratio [formula] with magnetic Reynolds, or Lundquist number Lu. Parameter α plays an important role in determining dynamics of the layer. If viscosity is dominated by ion-ion collisions, we may estimate α  ~  1 / (βMsKn), where β is plasma beta parameter (ratio of kinetic to magnetic pressure), M = v0 / cs is the flow Mach number (ratio of velocity to sound speed cs), Kn  =  λ / a is Knudsen number, the ratio of the mean free path λ to the characteristic length scale a.

These solutions are quite different from the case of isotropic viscosity [\citep=LLVIII] and have a number of particular feature. On the one hand, for large G  ≫  1, in the bulk of the flow the profile of f is linearly increasing, f  ~  z / α (flat velocity profile), similar to the isotropic viscosity case. The parallel magnetic field  drops back to 0 within a narrow boundary layer. Let us estimate the thickness of this boundary layer. Near the boundary f  →  0, so that an approximate solution of Eq. ([\ref=main]) is

[formula]

If we define the thickness of the boundary layer δ when f' = 0, we find

[formula]

where we assumed Gα  ≫  1. This expression can be compared with the case of isotropic viscosity, when δi / a  ~  1 / G. The ratio δ  /  δi  ~  1 / α  =  Lu / G2. Thus, parameter α  =  G2 / Lu measures the relative concentration of a magnetic field  profile toward the wall; for α  >  1 the boundary layer in case of anisotropic viscosity is narrower than in the isotropic case.

In most applications the ratio Lu / G3 is very small. For example, for the typical parameters of intercluster medium, velocity ~  1000 km/s and layer thickness ~  1kpc, plasma beta β = 100, we estimate Lu  =  1027, G = 1012, so that Lu / G3  ~  10- 9, thus δ  ≪  a.

Conclusion

In this letter we considered a basic plasma physics problem: Hartmann flow with anisotropic viscosity. We first argued that in the case when transverse viscosity is suppressed completely, the problem cannot be formulated in a physically meaningful way: there should be some small isotropic contribution to viscosity. We derived magnetic field  and velocity profiles, which in the limit of small isotropic viscosity floor are independent of its exact value. These profiles are considerably different from the case of isotropic viscosity. The velocity gradients are much more concentrated close to the walls of the channel than in the case of isotropic viscosity.

How important is the structure of a boundary layer for the overall structure of the flow? On the one hand, in a laminar regime at low Reynolds numbers, the structure of the boundary layer is probably not important: in the boundary layer the relative velocity just drops to zero, according to some law, without affecting the overall structure of the flow. On the other hand, properties of the boundary layer determine its stability and, thus, transition to turbulence [\citep=LLVI]. In ICM plasma the Reynolds numbers are in the range Re  ~  10 - 1000, while, typically, transition to turbulence occurs at Re  ~  100 - 1000. (Transition to turbulence occurs in the boundary layer). Thus, we expect that effects of anisotropic viscosity are likely to be very important for ICM plasma, especially for determining its transition to turbulence.

Thus, in simulating ICM dynamics it is imperative to use appropriate numerical schemes which take into account anisotropic viscosity (and to a lesser extent, conductivity), like the ones that have been applied to accretion disks [\citep=sharma07]. Though magnetic fields  are dynamically subdominant in ICM (plasma beta parameter is large), they do, in fact, determine its the dissipative properties, stability of embedded structures and transition to turbulence.
