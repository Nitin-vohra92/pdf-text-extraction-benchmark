Two graph isomorphism polytopes

Introduction

Let Pn be the set of n  ×  n permutation matrices and consider the following two polytopes,

[formula]

The polytope ψn,n was considered recently in [\cite=Fri] in connection with the graph isomorphism problem. Note that ψn and ψn,n have n! and (n!)2 vertices respectively. In this short note we show:

The polytope ψn is a face of the polytope ψn,n.

Deciding if a graph G has a subgraph isomorphic to a graph H reduces to optimization over ψn.

Optimization over ψn reduces to optimization over ψn,n.

In particular, this implies a result of [\cite=Fri] that subgraph isomorphism reduces to optimization over ψn,n.

So if P  ≠  NP then optimization and separation over ψn and hence over ψn,n cannot be done in polynomial time and a compact inequality description of ψn and hence of ψn,n cannot be determined.

Deciding if G has a subgraph that is isomorphic to H can also be reduced to optimization over a related polytope φn defined as follows. Each permutation σ of the vertices of the complete graph Kn naturally induces a permutation Σ of its edges by Σ({i,j}): = {σ(i),σ(j)}. Then φn is defined as the convex hull of all [formula] permutation matrices of induced permutations Σ. This polytope and a broader class of so-called Young polytopes have been studied in [\cite=Onn]. In particular, therein it was shown that the graph of φn is complete, so pivoting algorithms cannot be exploited for optimization over this polytope. It is an interesting question whether ψn and φn, having n! vertices each, are isomorphic.

Statements

Define bilinear forms on [formula] and on [formula] (note the shuffled indexation on the right) by

[formula]

Let I be the n  ×  n identity matrix and for a graph G let AG be its adjacency matrix. We show:

The polytope ψn is a face of ψn,n given by

[formula]

Let G and H be two graphs on n vertices with m the number of edges of H. Then

[formula]

with equality if and only if G has a subgraph that is isomorphic to H.

Let W = (Wi,s,j,t) be any tensor and let w: = 2n2 max |Wi,s,j,t|. Then

[formula]

Combining Theorems [\ref=T2] and [\ref=T3] with [formula] and w = n2 (sufficing since W  ≥  0, as is clear from the proof of Theorem [\ref=T3] below), we get the following somewhat tighter form of a result of [\cite=Fri].

Let G and H be two graphs on n vertices with m the number of edges of H. Then

[formula]

with equality if and only if G has a subgraph that is isomorphic to H.

Proofs

We record the following statement that follows directly from the definitions of the bilinear forms above.

For any two simple tensors [formula] and [formula] we have

[formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=T1].  For every P,Q∈Pn, the matrix [formula] is a permutation matrix, with [formula] if and only if P = Q. It follows that for every two distinct P,Q∈Pn we have

[formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=T2].  For any P∈Pn, the matrix [formula] is the adjacency matrix of the permutation of H by P. So [formula] with equality if and only if H is isomorphic via P to a subgraph of G. Since the maximum of a linear form over a polytope is attained at a vertex we get

[formula]

with the last inequality holding with equality if and only if G has a subgraph isomorphic to H. [formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=T3].   For every P,Q∈Pn, the tensor [formula] has n2 entries that are equal to 1 and all other entries equal to 0, and therefore [formula]. Combining this with inequality ([\ref=e1]) we see that for every two distinct P,Q∈Pn we have

[formula]

Since the maximum of a linear form over a polytope is attained at a vertex we obtain the inequality
