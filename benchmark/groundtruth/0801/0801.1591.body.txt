Generating function identities for ζ(2n + 2),ζ(2n + 3) via the WZ method

Introduction

The Riemann zeta function is defined by the series

[formula]

Apéry's irrationality proof of ζ(3) and series acceleration formulae for the first values of the Riemann zeta function going back to Markov's work [\cite=ma]

[formula]

stimulated intensive search of similar formulas for other values ζ(n),n  ≥  5. Many Apéry-like formulae have been proved with the help of generating function identities (see [\cite=ko] [\cite=algr] [\cite=br] [\cite=ri] [\cite=bbb]). M. Koecher [\cite=ko] (and independently Leshchiner [\cite=le]) proved that

[formula]

for any [formula] with |a| < 1. For even zeta values, Leshchiner [\cite=le] (in an expanded form) showed that (see [\cite=bbb])

[formula]

for any complex a, with |a| < 1. Recently, D. Bailey, J. Borwein and D. Bradley [\cite=bbb] proved another formula

[formula]

for any [formula]

In this paper, we present simpler proofs of identities ([\ref=eq01])-([\ref=eq03]) using the WZ method. By the same method we give some new representations for the generating functions ([\ref=eq01]), ([\ref=eq03]) yielding faster convergent series for values of the Riemann zeta function.

We recall [\cite=z] that a discrete function A(n,k) is called hypergeometric or closed form (CF) if the quotients

[formula]

are both rational functions of n and k. A pair of CF functions F(n,k) and G(n,k) is called a WZ pair if

[formula]

We need the following summation formulas.

Proposition 1. ([\cite=az]) For any WZ pair (F,G)

[formula]

whenever both sides converge.

Proposition 2. ([\cite=az]) For any WZ pair (F,G) we have

[formula]

whenever both sides converge.

As usual, (λ)ν is the Pochhammer symbol (or the shifted factorial) defined by

New generating function identities for ζ(2n + 2) and ζ(2n + 3)

Let a be a complex number not equal to a non-zero integer. Then

[formula]

Expanding both sides of ([\ref=eq05]) in powers of a2 and comparing coefficients of a2n gives Apéry-like series for ζ(2n + 3) for every non-negative integer n convergent at the geometric rate with ratio 1 / 27. In particular, comparing constant terms recovers Amdeberhan's formula [\cite=am] for ζ(3)

[formula]

Similarly, comparing coefficients of a2 gives

[formula]

or equivalently, and the theorem follows.

Let a be a complex number not equal to a non-zero integer. Then

[formula]

Formula ([\ref=eq06]) generates Apéry-like series for ζ(2n + 2) for every non-negative integer n convergent at the geometric rate with ratio 1 / 64. In particular, it follows that

Another proof of formula ([\ref=eq065]) can be found in [\cite=z].
