Adsorption of Indium on a InAs wetting layer deposited on the GaAs(001) surface

Introduction

Thanks to the strong charge carrier confinement, QDs have atomic-like properties that could be useful for applications in optical and optoelectronic devices, quantum computing, and information storage. One of the most challenging problems for quantum dot formation, is the control of their shape, composition and density. From this point of view the abundant experimental knowledge has not yet produced a sufficiently deep understanding of the physics of formation of quantum dots that could guide the way to control the growth process. In this situation first-principles simulations can be helpful in sheding light on the atomistic mechanisms that lead to dot nucleation at surfaces.

In the present paper, we address one of the most-studied systems: InAs quantum dots grown on a GaAs(001) substrate, where the lattice mismatch between InAs and GaAs is of the order of 7%. Strain relaxation at the surface acts as a driving force for a self-assembly process, the so called Stranski-Krastanov growth mode [\cite=stran], with the deposition of an atomically thin InGaAs wetting layer (WL) and subsequent surface mass transport accompanied by a 2D to 3D growth transition.

We focus our attention on the structural properties of the WL on which quantum dots nucleate, and on the interaction between a single In adatom and the surface, in order to find where the diffusion barriers are located and what the possible adsorption sites on the surface are, as a function of the wetting layer reconstruction.

We have chosen to investigate mainly the α2(2  ×  4) reconstruction of the (001) surface because of its stability under In-rich conditions and under compressive strain [\cite=ratsch] [\cite=add1] [\cite=add2] which is the case for the InAs WL grown on GaAs. Moreover, a (2  ×  4) reconstruction was found [\cite=balzarotti] [\cite=grandjean] [\cite=add3] [\cite=add4] to occur on the (001) wetting layer at the onset of dot nucleation in a In-rich WL condition. We have modeled a WL at a InAs coverage θ = 1.75 monolayer (ML) which is close to the critical value corresponding to the 2D to 3D transition [\cite=2to3]. The structural and geometrical properties of this surface have been investigated. Using the α2 reconstruction we have calculated the PES for a single In adatom, with the aim to understand what are the implications of the WL morphology (strain and composition) on the adsorption and surface mobility of the deposited In. To this end a comprehensive comparison with results reported previously in the literature for Ga and In adatoms and other surface reconstructions is given. In this context, a detailed analysis of the differences and analogies between the α2 and the β2 reconstructions is pursued.

In the literature similar calculations have been reported for GaAs

Theoretical method

We performed first principles calculations within Density Functional Theory in the local density approximation (DFT-LDA) [\cite=lda] using the exchange and correlation potential of Ceperley and Alder [\cite=cepa] as parametrized by Perdew and Zunger [\cite=pz]. For this kind of calculations both LDA [\cite=ratsch] [\cite=penevc4x4] [\cite=bechstedt] [\cite=wang] [\cite=lepage] and GGA [\cite=ruggerone] [\cite=giappi1] [\cite=giappi2] [\cite=penevpap] [\cite=kratzer] have been used in the literature. It has been demonstrated [\cite=add5] [\cite=add7] that both methods give qualitatively the same picture for the description of adatom adsorption on a surface, although LDA usually gives larger values for binding energies than GGA [\cite=add6]. Only the details can be different: LDA tends to overestimate the binding energy but for lattice constants, elastic moduli and surface energies the LDA calculated values are generally closer to the experimentally determined ones. We have used norm-conserving pseudopotentials treating the outermost s- and p-shells of Ga, In and As as valence electrons, and the electronic wave functions were expanded in plane-waves, with a 18 Ry kinetic energy cutoff. The energy cutoff has been tested in order to reach convergence for the lattice bulk properties of GaAs and InAs. The core corrected atomic pseudopotentials have been tested on bulk Ga, In and As, where the determined equilibrium configurations and elastic moduli compare well with the experimental data.

The equilibrium lattice parameters obtained for the GaAs and InAs bulk phases are a0 = 5.609 Å and a0 = 5.906 Å, which are slightly smaller than the experimental ones. Thus our calculated lattice mismatch is 5.4%, smaller than the experimental value. This is going to underestimate the WL strain. In sec. IV we will compare our results with results [\cite=penevc4x4] [\cite=penevpap] [\cite=kratzer] where this effect was instead overestimated.

Starting from the GaAs structure, we have set up the (001) oriented supercell containing 4 layers of GaAs, covered with 1.75 layers of InAs arranged according to the α2(2  ×  4) surface reconstruction. The lower layer of Ga atoms is kept fixed during the cell relaxation, in order to mimic the constraint due to the underlying semi-infinite bulk, and it is passivated with pseudo hydrogen atoms of 1.25 electron charge. The slab is repeated along the (001) direction with a periodicity 5a0 and a separation of about 10 Å of vacuum. As for the number of GaAs layers, we have found that only two layers suffice to obtain a correct description of the PES, minima and maxima positions. The refinement using two more GaAs layers produces a difference in the barrier heights all within 40 meV. Brillouin-zone (BZ) integration was carried out using a set of special k-points equivalent to 16 points in the 1  ×  1 surface BZ. A smearing of 0.02 Ry has been used in order to account for the possible metalization of the surface electronic structure.

In the α2(2  ×  4) reconstruction the last complete atomic layer is constituted by As atoms. A θ = 0.75 cation layer is deposited over it. This layer is then terminated with one As dimer (As ad-dimer) on top (see Fig. [\ref=struc]). The uncovered As on the last complete layer dimerizes along the

Results

Structure of (001)(2  ×  4) surface reconstructions

We have calculated the optimized geometries and the formation energies of the [formula] and β2(2  ×  4) reconstructions of the bare GaAs surface and of GaAs covered with a θ = 1.75 ML InAs layer. The surface energies vs. the As chemical potential μAs (whose value is related to the growth conditions such as growth temperature, cation/anion flux ratios) are calculated through the expression [\cite=fff]

[formula]

([formula], [formula] for pure GaAs). The obtained surface energies are reported in Fig. [\ref=phase]. Here [formula] is the total energy of the slab, [formula] is the chemical potential of the bulk phase of material xx, [formula] is the number of atoms of element y in the supercell and A is the surface unit cell area. A set of calculations is performed for a slab with two hydrogen passivated surfaces, in order to subtract the contribution of the bottom surfaces of the reconstructed slabs to be investigated, hence [formula] is the net contribution of the reconstructed slab. Elemental As, Ga and In are calculated using their ground state structures: respectively the rhombohedral A7 structure for As, α-Ga and bct In. All these calculations have been done using high convergence standards. We see that the range of stability of the α2 phase, when GaAs is covered with the InAs ad-layer, is larger than that of the bare GaAs surface. This means that the formation of the α2 phase will be favored over the β2 phase over a larger range of As flux values (or surface growth conditions), when the InAs WL is formed. This is in agreement with previous calculations showing a stabilization of the α2 phase for InAs under isotropic compressive strain [\cite=ratsch] [\cite=penevtesi] which is the condition of the InAs layer grown on GaAs.

Regarding the atomic structures, the comparison of the distances between the atomic planes, in the InAs covered GaAs case, shows that the values are systematically larger than those obtained for the pure GaAs surface by about 10 %, owing to the stress originated by the InAs/GaAs lattice mismatch. In particular, we remark the buckling of the bond between the In atoms in the uncompleted In layer found for the α2 reconstruction (see Fig. [\ref=struc]) due to the missing (with respect to the β2 reconstruction) second As ad-dimer. It was shown ([\cite=ratsch]) that this buckling plays a role in the stabilization of the α2 phase.

The potential energy surface of the single In adatom

In the following we describe our calculations for both the α2 and β2 surface reconstructions, with an accurate description of the adsorption sites and hopping barriers.

α2(2  ×  4) surface reconstruction

For this surface reconstruction we have found eleven adsorption sites for the In adatom, and the related saddle points. The energies of the minima and of the saddle points are given in Tables [\ref=tab1] and [\ref=tab2], respectively, and a graphical representation of the PES is reported in Fig. [\ref=pes]. In the Tables, the energies are relative to that of the deepest adsorption site A8 put to 0. Two main low potential trenches are evident along the

[formula]

direction (the highest barrier being 430 meV and the lowest being 52 meV) than along the orthogonal

[formula]

direction, that creates an unstable region for the In adsorption, as can be seen in the PES of Fig [\ref=pes]. From these considerations we can preliminarily conclude that adatom surface diffusion should be strongly anisotropic with the

[formula]

β2(2  ×  4) surface reconstruction

Since the symmetric part of the β2 has the same structure of half of the α2 surface, the coordinates of the adsorption sites can be roughly estimated, and their exact location can be found with a further relaxation of the surface-adsorbate system.

Also for the β2 surface reconstruction, we have found 11 adsorption sites for the Indium adatom (see Table [\ref=tab3] and Fig. [\ref=pb]). However, owing to the symmetry properties of the system, those minima reduce to only 6 inequivalent minima.

We first notice that the adsorption sites A1, A2, A4, A6, A7, A8, A9, are in strict correspondence to those of the α2 surface reconstruction (see Fig [\ref=mins-b2]), in the region where the two structures are similar i.e. far from the β2 second ad-dimer. The positions of the minima are only slightly affected by the presence of the extra As ad-dimer, and the deepest adsorption site A8 lies in the same position as for the α2 reconstruction. The minima A3 and A5 are shifted towards the trench with respect to the corresponding ones of the α2 reconstruction. This is due to the fact that the In adatoms in A3 and A5 on the α2 reconstruction are bonded to the buckled In at the trench edge. The same In is not buckled in β2 due to its bond to the second As ad-dimer row (compare Fig. [\ref=mc] to Fig. [\ref=ta]). To quantify the difference between the A1-A9 adsorption sites in the two reconstructions, we give in Table [\ref=tab5] the adsorption energy difference ΔE = Eβ(Ai) - Eα(Ai) (negative if In is more strongly bonded in the β2 than in α2 reconstruction) and the displacement [formula] between the corresponding binding locations. The adsorption energy is defined as

[formula]

In β2, A3' Fig [\ref=mins-b2] is the symmetric of the minimum A3. This minimum is not present in the α2 reconstruction because of the lower symmetry. A new minimum A12 is now present for β2 on top of the two ad-dimers and it is actually quite stable, since the In-adatom is fourfold bonded to the surface (see fig. [\ref=tb]). In this case the confinement barriers are calculated to be of the order of 135 meV. The configuration for In in the adsorption sites different from those of the α2 reconstruction, are given in Fig. [\ref=b2-mins].

Also in the β2 case, two trenches in the PES are evident along the [formula] direction at both sides of the As in-dimer. The existence of the A12 adsorption site on β2 could originate additional diffusion paths along the same direction connecting the minimum A12 to the two sites A2 and A7. The corresponding saddle point energies are reported in Table [\ref=tab4]. We can easily see that the barriers along

[formula]

direction that span the range 100-760 meV. This consideration strongly indicates that also for the β2 surface reconstruction, the In-adatom diffusion should be highly favored along the [formula] direction.

Additional adsorption sites due to In insertion in the As dimers

We know from the literature [\cite=penevc4x4] [\cite=ruggerone] that additional minima could be present, corresponding to the In adatom breaking the bond between the As adatoms in a dimer and binding itself to them. This process requires overcoming an energy barrier, thus its rate should depend on the growth temperature. These sites can be of significant interest, since they introduce a local modification of the PES that can be very important for surface diffusion. For example, such sites could be in a bridge location between two other adsorption sites, thus introducing a further minimum in an otherwise thicker barrier. Such an additional adsorption site can affect the diffusion kinetics of the In adatom on the surface.

We have considered both the As in-dimers and ad-dimers of the α2 and β2 surface reconstructions and determined the energy necessary to break the As-As bond and bind the In adatom. First of all we have put In in the middle between the two As atoms, in a vertical plane containing all the three atoms. We have then relaxed the system obtaining the minimum energy position for the In adatom. Finally we have performed different NEB calculations in order to find the energy barriers between these adsorption sites and the neighboring sites. We have found that the adsorption configuration with the In atom bonded to the two arsenic of the dimers are in general more stable than most of the other adsorption sites (see Tables [\ref=tab1] and [\ref=tab3]).

α2(2  ×  4) surface reconstruction

In this case we have found 2 additional stable sites for the In adsorbate. The first one corresponds to the breaking of the As ad-dimer and the second one to the breaking of the As in-dimer. The two cases are shown in figures [\ref=a2-ad] and [\ref=a2-in], respectively. Figures [\ref=a2-ad](a) and [\ref=a2-in](a) show the location of these minima, indicated as Aa and Ai respectively, on the surface (a = ad-dimer i = in-dimer). Figures [\ref=a2-ad](b) and [\ref=a2-in](b) show the atomic configuration of the adsorbate bonded to the As atoms in the dimers. The transitions to/from neighboring adsorption sites are also drawn in the figures (Figs. [\ref=a2-ad](c) and [\ref=a2-in](c)) and the corresponding minima and saddle point energies are given in Tables [\ref=tab1] and [\ref=tab2] respectively. We can see that those minima are deep and stable, since the confining barriers (≃ 0.8 eV), pictured in Figures [\ref=a2-ad](d) and [\ref=a2-in](d) are high. The energy barrier needed to fall into Aa from the site A10 (the precursor site) is not too high (around 200 meV) and this process is likely to occur even at relatively low temperature.

β2(2  ×  4) surface reconstruction

In this case we have two As ad-dimers instead of one. We have found one adsorption site for the In adatom for each one of the ad-dimers indicated in Figures [\ref=b2-ad] as Aa1 and Aa2. We have found that the In adsorbate does not lie in the vertical plane passing through the As dimers, but the bonds are tilted towards the other ad-dimer, that is towards the symmetry plane passing through the A12 adsorption site. Regarding the As in-dimer we have found two distinct possibilities for In adsorption that we indicate as Ai1 and Ai2 in Figure [\ref=b2-in]. As can be seen from Fig. [\ref=b2-in](b), the In atom bonds to the two As of the in-dimer forming a tilted angle φ with respect to the vertical z direction. Since the (110) is a plane of symmetry for the system, the two configurations for the adsorbate, corresponding to angles φ and -  φ, with respect to the z axis are equivalent and have the same probability to occur.

Figures [\ref=b2-ad](a) and [\ref=b2-in](a) show the location of the adsorption sites for the As ad-dimers and As in-dimer, respectively. The atomic configurations for the adsorbates are given in Figures [\ref=b2-ad](b) and [\ref=b2-in](b), whereas the transitions to/from neighboring adsorption sites are reported in Figures [\ref=b2-ad](c) and [\ref=b2-in](c). Finally Figures [\ref=b2-ad](d) and [\ref=b2-in](d) plot the energy barriers separating these adsorption sites from the neighboring ones.

Tables [\ref=tab3] and [\ref=tab4] report the energies for the stable configurations and the corresponding saddle points. Even in this case we have found very high binding energies for these adsorption sites and high energy barriers (around 0.7 eV) that make these configurations very stable once the adatom reaches them overcoming the barriers.

Discussion

In order to evaluate the effects of the strain and the role of the different surface reconstructions on the In adsorption properties we now compare our results with the results of similar calculations reported in the literature. To better evaluate the differences we report in Fig. [\ref=minima] the more common adsorption features as extracted by the literature and the present work. In the same figure we name each specific adsorption site with respect to its position relative to the As in-dimers (i) and ad-dimers (a), and indicate also the reconstructions where these adsorption sites are typical.

α2 vs β2 reconstruction (this work)

There are no big differences between the adsorption features on the α2 and on the β2 surface reconstructions. In particular, the adsorption energy and location differences (see Table [\ref=tab5]) between corresponding adsorption sites, are within a few hundreds of meV. The greatest differences are those in the region of the missing ad-dimer where the structural difference between the two surface reconstructions is larger. On the β2 reconstruction the positions and energies of the adsorption sites are modified owing to the symmetry properties of the reconstruction. The most important difference is the presence of the adsorption sites A3' and A12 on the β2 surface reconstruction, that are absent on the α2 surface reconstruction. On the contrary, the adsorption sites A10 and A11 of α2 disappear in β2 transforming into the top ad-dimer site A12.

1.75 ML InAs on GaAs [formula] vs InAs [formula]

In this subsection we compare our results for In adsorption on the [formula] reconstruction of the InAs WL on GaAs(001) with the results for In adsorption on the [formula] reconstruction of pure InAs(001) of ref. [\cite=giappi1] [\cite=giappi2]. The main difference between the two cases is that the InAs WL on GaAs is subjected to a compressive strain on the (001) plane. Thus, the comparison allows us to evaluate the effect of the WL strain on In adsorption. We principally refer to Fig.2 of ref.[\cite=giappi1] and to Table [\ref=tab6] of the present paper, where we have reported the energies of the minima of In on the InAs surface [\cite=private].

In the case of pure InAs[\cite=giappi1], only six minima were calculated and their positions on the surface are almost the same as those calculated by us. In particular, only one minimum B8 in the bridge in-dimer position (see Fig. [\ref=minima]) was found halfway between the two equal minima A6 and A8 calculated by us for the InAs/GaAs case. The two minima A6 and A8 are separated by a relatively high barrier of 300 meV in our calculation. We recall here that for α2 we calculate barriers only 42 and 142 meV high between the same adsorption sites. (A6 and A8 are no more equivalent in α2).

In the case of pure InAs, the besides in-dimer B4 and B9 show the strongest binding. In the case of the InAs WL on GaAs, instead, the more strongly bonded sites are located at the bridge in-dimer positions A6 and A8. From Tables [\ref=tab3] and [\ref=tab6] we see that the energy difference between the sites (4-9) and (6-8) is larger for the InAs WL on GaAs case (240 meV vs 61 meV). It is reasonable to think that this difference is to be ascribed to the strain originated by the lattice mismatch between InAs and GaAs. Also the absence of the shallow adsorption sites corresponding to A1, A5, A3 and A10 could be originated by the absence of the strain.

Nevertheless, it is possible that these differences are originated also by the different grid resolution used for calculating the PES, or by the interpolation algorithms that sometimes are not able to identify correctly the minima or by the difference between GGA used in ref. [\cite=giappi1] and LDA used in this work.

In on InAs/GaAs [formula] vs Ga on GaAs [formula]

At this stage of the discussion we compare our results for the β2 reconstruction with the results obtained in ref. [\cite=ruggerone], where the PES of a Ga adatom on the [formula] surface reconstruction of GaAs(001) was studied. This comparison evidences the different behavior of In and Ga adsorbates, as opposed to the WL composition.

In the case of Ga on GaAs(001) only three minima were reported (without considering the additional minima where Ga breaks the dimers). Two minima are at bridge ad-dimer positions while the third one is at a bridge in-dimer position. These adsorption sites correspond to the A2, A7 and A6-A8 minima on the InAs WL and to B2, B7 and B8 minima of the In on InAs(001) case [\cite=giappi1]. These minima are quite stable. Notice the missing of the A12 adsorption site on the top ad-dimer location, which is present in the case of the In adsorbate on β2 reconstructed InAs covered surfaces. Also the adsorption sites in the besides in-dimer locations are missing in this case.

In adatom on InGaAs surfaces

In this section we compare with the results of ref. [\cite=penevpap] [\cite=penevc4x4] where InGaAs reconstructions of the WL on GaAs were considered. The PESs of the In adatom on: (i) In2 / 3Ga1 / 3As(001) [formula] (corresponding to a In coverage θ = 0.66), (ii) In2 / 3Ga1 / 3As(001) [formula] (corresponding to θ = 0.66), and (iii) GaAs(001) [formula] (corresponding to θ = 0) surface reconstructions were studied. From all these calculations we can see that one adsorption site is always located in a top ad-dimer position, in the same configuration of the A12 adsorption site on β2 of this work. The depth of these adsorption sites defined by the height of the lowest barrier confining the adsorbate are: 140 meV, 60 meV, 100 meV, 385 meV and 135 meV for [formula], [formula], [formula], InAs [formula] and InAs WL on GaAs [formula], respectively. We can see that these minima are not strongly bonded, apart from the case of In on pure InAs(001) β2 reconstructed surface.

The deepest minima are located at the besides in-dimer location, both in the case of the [formula] reconstruction of [\cite=penevpap] and of the reconstructions studied in this work. In the case of the [formula] reconstruction, stable locations are at the missing ad-dimer sites (see fig. [\ref=minima]). In these adsorption sites the In adatom binds to four As atoms below. In the case of the [formula] reconstruction the stable location sees the In atoms bonded to the cations layer below.

Conclusions

We have carried out a first-principles study of the adsorption properties of an In adatom deposited on a InAs wetting layer on GaAs(001) reconstructed [formula] or [formula]. We have first studied the equilibrium geometry of the surfaces and the relative phase stability with respect to the growth conditions. We have found that, in the case of the InAs WL the interlayer distances are systematically higher than those of pure GaAs, owing to the compressive strain. Moreover, we have found that the α2 reconstruction of the InAs WL is favored over the β2 reconstruction, for a wider range of growth conditions, when compared to the bare GaAs(001) surface.

We have analyzed the PES for an In adatom determining the adsorption sites and the saddle points for both α2 and β2 reconstructions. We have found 11 minima in the PES for both reconstructions. Most of them occur in the same positions in both cases. Two minima are instead specific of the α2 and β2 reconstructions, due to the presence on β2 of an additional As ad-dimer. For the adsorption sites present on both reconstructions, we have studied the change of the adsorption energy and location caused by the presence or absence of the second As ad-dimer. We have identified two low-energy trenches along the
