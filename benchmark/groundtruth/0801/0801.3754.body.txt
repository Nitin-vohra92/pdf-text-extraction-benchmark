Representation of nonnegative convex polynomials

Introduction

An important research area of real algebraic geometry is concerned with representations of polynomials positive on a basic semi-algebraic set

[formula]

where [formula], [formula].

An important result in this vein is Schmüdgen's Positivstellensatz [\cite=schmudgen] which states that if [formula] is compact and [formula] is positive on [formula] then f belongs to the preordering P(g) generated by the gj's; bounds on the degrees in the representation are even provided in Schweighofer [\cite=markus]. Under a rather weak additional assumption on the gj's, Putinar's refinement [\cite=putinar] states that f even belongs to the quadratic module Q(g) generated by the gj's. The above mentioned representation results do not specialize when f is convex and the gj's are concave (so that [formula] is convex) a highly important case, particularly in optimization. Also, as soon as [formula] is not compact any more then negative results, notably by Scheiderer [\cite=claus], exclude to represent any f positive on [formula] as an element of P(g) or Q(g) (except perhaps in low-dimensional cases). For more details, the interested reader is referred to the nice survey [\cite=claus].

However, inspired and motivated by some classical results from convex optimization, we show that specialized representation results are possible when f is convex and the gj's are concave, in which case [formula] is a closed (not necessarily compact) convex basic semi-algebraic set. Namely, a specific subset Qc(g) of the quadratic module Q(g) is such that [formula] is dense (for the l1-norm of coefficients) in the convex cone F of convex polynomials, nonnegative on [formula].

Convex polynomials on a convex semi-algebraic set

Notation and Preliminaries

Let [formula] be the ring of real polynomials in the variables [formula], and let [formula] be the subset of sums of squares (sos) polynomials. If [formula], write [formula], and denote its l1-norm by [formula]).

Let [formula] be the quadratic module generated by a set of polynomials [formula], that is,

[formula]

Throughout the paper we make the following assumption. Assumption [\ref=ass1](b), known as Slater condition, is an important regularity condition for the celebrated Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions.

Let Assumption [\ref=ass1] hold and let [formula] be convex and such that [formula] for some [formula].

Then there exists [formula] such that

[formula]

In other words, the Lagrangian [formula] defined by

[formula]

is a nonnegative polynomial which satisfies

[formula]

See e.g. Polyak [\cite=polyak].

Convex Positivstellensatz

If one is interested in representation of polynomials nonnegative on [formula], the first polynomial to consider is of course f - f* where [formula]. Indeed, any other positive polynomial is just (f - f*) + f* with [formula]. And so, if f - f* belongs to some preordering or some quadratic module, then so does f. From Proposition [\ref=prop1] it is easy to establish the following result.

Let Assumption [\ref=ass1] hold and let [formula] be convex and such that [formula] for some [formula]. If the nonnegative polynomial Lf of ([\ref=lagrangian]) is sos then

[formula]

for some convex sos polynomial σ∈Σ2 and some nonnegative scalars λj, [formula]. That is, f - f*∈Q(g), with Q(g) as in ([\ref=quad]). In addition, the sos weights associated with the gj's are just nonnegative constants, and σ is convex.

Follows from the definition ([\ref=lagrangian]) of Lf, and the fact that Lf is sos.

Hence in view of Corollary [\ref=coro1], an interesting issue is to provide sufficient conditions for Lf to be sos. For instance, consider the following definition from Helton and Nie [\cite=helton]

A polynomial [formula] is sos-convex if its Hessian [formula] is a sum of squares (sos), that is, there is some integer p and some matrix polynomial [formula] such that

[formula]

Let Assumption [\ref=ass1] hold, and let [formula] be convex and such that [formula] for some [formula].

If f is sos-convex and - gj is sos-convex for every [formula], then f - f*∈Q(g). More precisely, ([\ref=main]) holds for some convex sos polynomial σ∈Σ2 and some nonnegative scalars λj, [formula].

From Proposition [\ref=prop1], let Lf be as in ([\ref=lagrangian]). As f and - gj are sos convex, write

[formula]

for some [formula] and some [formula], [formula]. Hence,

[formula]

with [formula], and so Lf is sos-convex. As ([\ref=kkt2]) holds, by Lemma 3.2 in Helton and Nie [\cite=helton], the polynomial Lf is sos, and so, by Corollary [\ref=coro1], the desired result ([\ref=main]) holds.

Next, consider the subset Qc(g)  ⊂  Q(g) defined by:

[formula]

The set Qc(g) is a specialization of Q(g) to the convex case, in that the weights asociated with the gj's are nonnegative scalars, i.e., sos polynomials of degree 0, and the sos polynomial σ is convex.

Let Assumption [\ref=ass1] hold, and let Qc(g) be as in ([\ref=qc]). Let [formula] be the convex cone of convex polynomials nonnegative on [formula].

Then [formula] is dense in F for the l1-norm ||  ·  ||1. In particular, if [formula] (so that F is now the set of nonnegative convex polynomials), then [formula] is dense in F.

Let f∈F and let r0: = ⌊( deg  f) / 2⌋ + 1. Given [formula], let [formula] be the polynomial

[formula]

For every ε > 0, the polynomial fε0(X): = f(X) + ε  Θr0(X) is convex and nonnegative on [formula], i.e., fε0∈F. In addition,

[formula]

for some [formula]. Indeed, the level set [formula] is compact for every [formula], and so, fε0 attains its minimum on [formula]. Obviously, we also have [formula] as [formula]. Next, let Lfε0 be as in ([\ref=lagrangian]), i.e.,

[formula]

for some nonnegative vector [formula]. As [formula] on [formula], by Corollary 3.3 in Lasserre and Netzer [\cite=lassnetzer], there exists [formula] such that for every r  ≥  rε, Lfε0  +  ε  Θr is sos. That is, σ: = Lfε0  +  ε  Θr∈Σ2 and so

[formula]

Notice that by definition, σ∈Σ2 is convex. Next, as [formula], σ + f*ε∈Σ2, and so, equivalently, fε∈Qc(g).

In addition, fε∈F because fε is convex (as fε  =  f + ε(Θr0  +  Θr)) and nonnegative on [formula] (as fε  ≥  f), and so, [formula]. Finally, ||f - fε||1  =  ε||Θr0  +  Θr||1  →  0 as [formula].

Finally, if [formula] (so that F is now the set of nonnegative convex polynomials), one obtains Qc(g) = Σ2.

One may also replace Θr in ([\ref=Theta]) with the new perturbation

[formula]

This perturbation also preserves convexity. In addition, not only ||f - fε||1  →  0 as [formula], but the convergence fε  →  f is also uniform on compact sets!
