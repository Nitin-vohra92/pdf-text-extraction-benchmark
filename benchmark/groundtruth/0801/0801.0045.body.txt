Introduction

Supersymmetric (SUSY) extensions of the Standard Model rank among the most promising and well-explored scenarios for New Physics at the TeV scale. Given the long history of supersymmetry and the number of people working in the field, several different conventions for defining supersymmetric theories have been proposed over the years, many of which have come into widespread use. At present, therefore, no unique set of conventions prevails. In principle, this is not a problem. As long as everything is clearly and consistently defined, a translation can always be made between two sets of conventions.

However, the proliferation of conventions does have some disadvantages. Results obtained by different authors or computer codes are not always directly comparable. Hence, if author/code A wishes to use the results of author/code B in a calculation, a consistency check of all the relevant conventions and any necessary translations must first be made - a tedious and error-prone task.

To deal with this problem, and to create a more transparent situation for non-experts, the original SUSY Les Houches Accord (SLHA1) was proposed [\cite=Skands:2003cj]. This accord uniquely defines a set of conventions for supersymmetric models together with a common interface between codes. The most essential fact is not what the conventions are in detail (they largely resemble those of [\cite=Chung:2003fi]), but that they are consistent and unambiguous, hence reducing the problem of translating between conventions to a linear, rather than a factorial, dependence on the number of codes involved. At present, these codes can be categorised roughly as follows (see [\cite=Allanach:2008zn] [\cite=bsmrepository] for a review and on-line repository):

Spectrum calculators [\cite=Baer:1999sp] [\cite=Allanach:2001kg] [\cite=Porod:2003um] [\cite=Djouadi:2002ze], which calculate the supersymmetric mass and coupling spectrum, assuming some (given or derived) SUSY-breaking terms and a matching to known data on the Standard Model parameters.

Observables calculators [\cite=Beenakker:1996ed] [\cite=Djouadi:1998yw] [\cite=Heinemeyer:1998yj] [\cite=Muhlleitner:2003vg] [\cite=Lee:2003nta] [\cite=Belanger:2004yn] [\cite=Gondolo:2004sc] [\cite=Ellwanger:2004xm] [\cite=fchdecay] [\cite=Degrassi:2007kj] [\cite=Mahmoudi:2007vz]; packages which calculate one or more of the following: collider production cross sections (cross section calculators), decay partial widths (decay packages), relic dark matter density (dark matter packages), and indirect/precision observables, such as rare decay branching ratios or Higgs/electroweak observables (constraint packages).

Monte-Carlo event generators [\cite=Corcella:2000bw] [\cite=Moretti:2002eu] [\cite=Sjostrand:2006za] [\cite=Mrenna:1996hu] [\cite=Hagiwara:2005wg] [\cite=Katsanevas:1998fb] [\cite=Reuter:2005us] [\cite=Cho:2006sx] [\cite=Kilian:2007gr], which calculate cross sections through explicit statistical simulation of high-energy particle collisions. By including resonance decays, parton showering, hadronisation, and underlying-event effects, fully exclusive final states can be studied, and, for instance, detector simulations interfaced.

SUSY and CKM fitting programs [\cite=Bechtle:2004pc] [\cite=Lafaye:2004cn] [\cite=Ciuchini:2000de] [\cite=Charles:2004jd] which fit model parameters to collider-type data.

At the time of writing, the SLHA1 has already, to a large extent, obliterated the need for separately coded (and maintained and debugged) interfaces between many of these codes. Moreover, it has provided users with input and output in a common format, which is more readily comparable and transferable. Finally, the SLHA convention choices are also being adapted for other tasks, such as the SPA project [\cite=Aguilar-Saavedra:2005pw]. We believe, therefore, that the SLHA project has been useful, solving a problem that, for experts, is trivial but frequently occurring and tedious to deal with, and which, for non-experts, is an unnecessary headache.

However, SLHA1 was designed exclusively with the MSSM with real parameters and R-parity conservation in mind. Some recent public codes [\cite=Dreiner:1999qz] [\cite=Skands:2001it] [\cite=Allanach:2001kg] [\cite=Sjostrand:2002ip] [\cite=Porod:2003um] [\cite=Ellwanger:2005dv] [\cite=Frank:2006yh] [\cite=fchdecay] [\cite=Degrassi:2007kj] are either implementing extensions to this base model or are anticipating such extensions. It therefore seems prudent at this time to consider how to extend SLHA1 to deal with more general supersymmetric theories. In particular, we will consider R-parity violation (), flavour violation (FLV), and CP-violating (CPV) phases in the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM). We will also consider next-to-minimal models (i.e., models in which the MSSM field content is augmented by a gauge-singlet chiral superfield) which we shall collectively label by the acronym NMSSM.

Rather than giving exhaustive historical references for all concepts used in this article, we provide a list of useful and pedagogical reviews to whose contents and references in turn we refer. For the various topics treated in the article, these reviews are:

SUSY [\cite=Martin:1997ns],

FLV [\cite=Misiak:1997ei],

Neutrinos [\cite=GonzalezGarcia:2007ib],

[\cite=Barbier:2004ez] [\cite=Hirsch:2000ef],

CPV [\cite=CPV-Accomando:2006ga],

NMSSM [\cite=NMSSM-Accomando:2006ga],

SUSY Tools [\cite=Allanach:2008zn] [\cite=bsmrepository].

There is clearly some tension between the desirable goals of generality of the models, ease of implementation in programs, and practicality for users. A completely general accord would be useless in practice if it was so complicated that no one would implement it. We have agreed on the following for SLHA2: for the MSSM, we will here restrict our attention to either CPV or , but not both. For RPV and flavour violation, we shall work in the Super-CKM/PMNS basis, as defined in sections [\ref=sec:flv] and [\ref=sec:rpv]. For the NMSSM, we define one catch-all model and extend the SLHA1 mixing only to include the new states, with CP, R-parity, and flavour still assumed conserved.

To make the interface independent of programming languages, compilers, platforms etc, the SLHA1 is based on the transfer of three different ASCII files (or potentially a character string containing identical ASCII information): one for model input, one for spectrum calculator output, and one for decay calculator output. We believe that the advantage of implementation independence outweighs the disadvantage of codes using SLHA1 having to parse input. Indeed, there are tools to assist with this task [\cite=Hahn:2004bc] [\cite=Hahn:2006nq] [\cite=PlehnAndKreiss].

Care was taken in SLHA1 to provide a framework for the MSSM that could easily be extended to the cases listed above. The conventions and switches described here are designed to be a superset of those of the original SLHA1 and so, unless explicitly mentioned in the text, we will assume the conventions of the original accord [\cite=Skands:2003cj] implicitly. For instance, all dimensionful parameters quoted in the present paper are assumed to be in the appropriate power of GeV, all angles are in radians, and the output formats for SLHA2 data BLOCKs follow those of SLHA1. In a few cases it will be necessary to replace the original conventions. This is clearly remarked upon in all places where it occurs, and the SLHA2 conventions then supersede the SLHA1 ones.

Extensions of SLHA1

Since its first publication, a few useful extensions to the SLHA1 have been identified. These are collected here for reference and are independent of the more general SUSY models discussed in subsequent sections. (Also note the recent proposal for a joint SLHA+LHEF format for BSM event generation [\cite=Alwall:2006yp] [\cite=Alwall:2007mw].)

Firstly, we introduce additional optional entries in the SLHA1 block EXTPAR to allow for using either the A0 or H+ pole masses as input instead of the parameter [formula] defined in [\cite=Skands:2003cj].

Secondly, to allow for different parameters to be defined at different scales (e.g., μ defined at [formula], the remaining parameters defined at [formula]) we introduce a new optional block QEXTPAR which, if present, overrides the default MINPAR and EXTPAR scale choices for specific parameters, as defined below.

While there is no obligation on codes to implement these extensions, we perceive it as useful that the accord allows for them, enabling a wider range of input parameter sets to be considered. The entries defined in EXTPAR and QEXTPAR in the SLHA2 are thus (repeating unchanged EXTPAR entries for completeness):

BLOCK EXTPAR

Optional input parameters for non-minimal/non-universal models. This block may be entirely absent from the input file, in which case a minimal type of the selected SUSY breaking model will be used. When block EXTPAR is present, the starting point is still a minimal model with parameters as given in MINPAR [\cite=Skands:2003cj] but with each value present in EXTPAR replacing the minimal model value of that parameter, as applicable. If MINPAR is not present, then all model parameters must be specified explicitly using EXTPAR. All scale-dependent parameters are understood to be given in the  scheme.

Optional alternative input scales for specific parameters. This block should normally be absent, in which case the default input scale or [formula] (see EXTPAR 0) will be used for all parameters. We stress that most codes cannot be expected to allow for multiple arbitrary scale choices, so the relevant manual and output should be carefully checked to make sure the desired behaviour is obtained.

Model Selection

To define the general properties of the model, we propose to introduce global switches in the SLHA1 model definition block MODSEL, as follows. Note that the switches defined here are in addition to the ones in [\cite=Skands:2003cj].

BLOCK MODSEL

Switches and options for model selection. The entries in this block should consist of an index, identifying the particular switch in the listing below, followed by another integer or real number, specifying the option or value chosen:

General MSSM

For convenience, we here repeat the definitions of the field content, superpotential and soft SUSY-breaking potential of the MSSM in the notation of [\cite=Skands:2003cj].

Specifically, the chiral superfields of the MSSM have the following [formula] quantum numbers

[formula]

the superpotential (omitting RPV terms, see section [\ref=sec:rpv]) is written as

[formula]

and the trilinear and bilinear soft SUSY-breaking potentials V3 and V2 are

[formula]

where a tilde over the symbol for a quark or lepton superfield denotes its scalar component (note however that we define, e.g., ũ*R as the scalar component of Ū). Throughout this section, we denote SU(2)L fundamental representation indices by a,b = 1,2 and generation indices by i,j = 1,2,3. Colour indices are everywhere suppressed, since only trivial contractions are involved. εab is the totally antisymmetric tensor, with ε12  =  ε12 = 1.

Flavour Violation

The quark sector and the super-CKM basis

Within the MSSM there are in general new sources of flavour violation arising from a possible misalignment of quarks and squarks in flavour space. The severe experimental constraints on flavour violation have no direct explanation in the structure of the unconstrained MSSM which leads to the well-known supersymmetric flavour problem.

The Super-CKM basis of the squarks is very useful in this context because in that basis only physically measurable parameters are present. In the Super-CKM basis the quark mass matrix is diagonal and the squarks are rotated in parallel to their superpartners. Actually, once the electroweak symmetry is broken, a rotation in flavour space

[formula]

of all matter superfields in the (s)quark superpotential

[formula]

brings fermions from the interaction eigenstate basis {doL,uoL,doR,uoR} to their mass eigenstate basis {dL,uL,dR,uR}:

[formula]

and the scalar superpartners to the basis {d̃L,ũL,d̃R,ũR}. Through this rotation, the Yukawa matrices YD and YU are reduced to their diagonal form ŶD and ŶU:

[formula]

Tree-level mixing terms among quarks of different generations are due to the misalignment of Vd and Vu, expressed via the CKM matrix

[formula]

which is proportional to the tree-level ūLidLjW+, ūLidRjH+, and ūRidLjH+ couplings (i,j = 1,2,3). This is also true for the supersymmetric counterparts of these vertices, in the limit of unbroken supersymmetry.

In the super-CKM basis the 6  ×  6 mass matrices for the up-type and down-type squarks are defined as

[formula]

where Φu  =  (ũL,L,t̃L,ũR,R,t̃R)T and Φd  =  (d̃L,s̃L,L,d̃R,s̃R,R)T. We diagonalise the squark mass matrices via [formula] unitary matrices Ru,d, such that [formula] are diagonal matrices with increasing mass squared values. The flavour-mixed mass matrices read:

[formula]

In the equations above we introduced the 3  ×  3 matrices

[formula]

[formula]

where the un-hatted mass matrices m2Q,u,d and trilinear interaction matrices TU,D are given in the interaction basis.

The matrices mu,d are the diagonal up-type and down-type quark masses and Df  LL,RR are the D-terms given by:

[formula]

which are also flavour diagonal. Here, Qf is the electric charge of the left-handed chiral supermultiplet to which the squark belongs, i.e., it is 2 / 3 for U and - 2 / 3 for Uc. Note that the up-type and down-type squark mass matrices in eqs. ([\ref=massmatrixu]) and ([\ref=massmatrixd]) cannot be simultaneously flavour-diagonal unless [formula] is flavour-universal (i.e., proportional to the identity in flavour space).

The lepton sector and the super-PMNS basis

For the lepton sector, we adopt a super-PMNS basis, as defined in this section.

Neutrino oscillation data have provided a strong indication that neutrinos have masses and that there are flavour-changing charged currents in the leptonic sector. One popular model to produce such effects is the see-saw mechanism, where right-handed neutrinos have both Majorana masses as well as Yukawa couplings with the left-handed leptons.When the heavy neutrinos are integrated out of the effective field theory, one is left with three light approximately left-handed neutrinos which are identified with the ones observed experimentally. There are other models of neutrino masses, for example involving SU(2) Higgs triplets, that, once the triplets have been integrated out, also lead to effective Majorana masses for the neutrinos. Here, we cover all cases that lead to a low energy effective field theory with Majorana neutrino masses and one sneutrino per family. In terms of this low energy effective theory, the lepton mixing phenomenon is analogous to the quark mixing case and so we adapt the conventions defined above to the leptonic case.

After electroweak symmetry breaking, the neutrino sector of the MSSM contains the Lagrangian pieces (in 2-component notation)

[formula]

where mν is a 3  ×  3 symmetric matrix. The interaction eigenstate basis neutrino fields νo are related to the mass eigenstate ones ν by

[formula]

reducing the mass matrix mν to its diagonal form ν

[formula]

The charged lepton fields have a 3  ×  3 Yukawa coupling matrix defined in the (s)lepton superpotential

[formula]

where the charged lepton interaction eigenstates {eoL,eoR} are related to the mass eigenstates {eL,eR,} by

[formula]

The equivalent diagonalised charged lepton Yukawa matrix is

[formula]

Lepton mixing in the charged current interaction can then be characterised by the PMNS matrix

[formula]

which is proportional to the tree-level ēLiνjW- and ēRiνjH- couplings (i,j = 1,2,3). This is also true for the supersymmetric counterparts of these vertices, in the limit of unbroken supersymmetry.

Rotating the interaction eigenstates of the sleptons identically to their leptonic counterparts, we obtain the super-PMNS basis for the charged sleptons and the sneutrinos, described by the Lagrangian

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula]. M2ẽ is the 6  ×  6 matrix

[formula]

and [formula] is the 3  ×  3 matrix

[formula]

where DeLL and DνLL are given in eq. ([\ref=dterm]). In the equations above we introduced the 3  ×  3 matrices

[formula]

[formula]

where the un-hatted mass matrices m2L,e and the trilinear interaction matrix TE are given in the interaction basis. We diagonalise the charged slepton and sneutrino mass matrices via the unitary 6×  6 and 3  ×  3 matrices Re,ν respectively. Thus, [formula] are diagonal with increasing entries toward the bottom right of each matrix.

Explicit proposal for SLHA2

As in the SLHA1 [\cite=Skands:2003cj], for all running parameters in the output of the spectrum file, we propose to use definitions in the modified dimensional reduction ([formula]) scheme. The basis is the super-CKM/PMNS basis as defined above, that is the one in which the Yukawa couplings of the SM fermions, given in the [formula] scheme, are diagonal. Note that the masses and vacuum expectation values (VEVs) in eqs. ([\ref=diagyukawa]), ([\ref=eq:diagmL]), and ([\ref=eq:diagYL]) must thus also be the running ones in the [formula] scheme.

The input for an explicit implementation in a spectrum calculator consists of the following information:

By default, all input SUSY parameters are given at the scale [formula] as defined in the SLHA1 block EXTPAR (see above). In principle, advanced codes may also allow for separate input scales for the sfermion mass matrices and trilinear couplings, via the block QEXTPAR defined above, but we emphasise that this should be regarded as non-standard.

For the SM input parameters, we take the Particle Data Group (PDG) definition: lepton masses are all on-shell. The light quark masses mu,d,s are given at 2 GeV, and the heavy quark masses are given as [formula], [formula] and [formula]. The latter two quantities are already in the SLHA1. The others are added to SMINPUTS in the following manner (repeating the SLHA1 parameters for convenience):

The FORTRAN format is the same as that of SMINPUTS in SLHA1 [\cite=Skands:2003cj].

[formula]: the input CKM matrix in the Wolfenstein parameterisation, in the block VCKMIN. Note that present CKM studies do not precisely define a renormalisation scheme for this matrix since the electroweak effects that renormalise it are highly suppressed and generally neglected. We therefore assume that the CKM elements given by PDG (or by UTFit [\cite=Ciuchini:2000de] and CKMFitter[\cite=Charles:2004jd], the main collaborations that extract the CKM parameters) refer to SM [formula] quantities defined at Q = mZ, to avoid any possible ambiguity. VCKMIN should have the following entries

:

:

The FORTRAN format is the same as that of SMINPUTS above.

[formula]: the input PMNS matrix, in the block UPMNSIN. It should have the PDG parameterisation in terms of rotation angles [\cite=Yao:2006px] (all in radians):

The FORTRAN format is the same as that of SMINPUTS above. Majorana phases have no effect on neutrino oscillations. However, they have physical consequences in the case of, for example, ββ0ν decay of nuclei.

[formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula]: the squark and slepton soft SUSY-breaking masses at the input scale in the super-CKM/PMNS basis, as defined above. They will be given in the new blocks MSQ2IN, MSU2IN, MSD2IN, MSL2IN, MSE2IN, with the FORTRAN format where the first two integers in the format correspond to i and j and the double precision number to the soft mass squared. Only the "upper triangle" of these matrices should be given. If diagonal entries are present, these supersede the parameters in the SLHA1 block EXTPAR.

[formula], [formula], and [formula]: the squark and slepton soft SUSY-breaking trilinear couplings at the input scale in the super-CKM/PMNS basis. They will be given in the new blocks TUIN, TDIN, TEIN, in the same format as the soft mass matrices above. If diagonal entries are present these supersede the A parameters specified in the SLHA1 block EXTPAR [\cite=Skands:2003cj].

For the output, the pole masses are given in block MASS as in SLHA1 (note, however, that some PDG numbers have different assignments in SLHA2, see below) and the [formula] and mixing parameters as follows:

[formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula]: the squark and slepton soft SUSY-breaking masses at scale Q in the super-CKM/PMNS basis. Will be given in the new blocks MSQ2 Q=..., MSU2 Q=..., MSD2 Q=..., MSL2 Q=..., MSE2 Q=..., with formats as the corresponding input blocks MSX2IN above.

[formula], [formula], and [formula]: The squark and slepton soft SUSY-breaking trilinear couplings in the super-CKM/PMNS basis. Given in the new blocks TU Q=..., TD Q=..., TE Q=..., which supersede the SLHA1 blocks AD, AU, and AE, see [\cite=Skands:2003cj].

[formula], [formula], [formula]: the diagonal [formula] Yukawas in the super-CKM/PMNS basis, with Ŷ defined by eqs. ([\ref=diagyukawa]) and ([\ref=eq:diagYL]), at the scale Q. Given in the SLHA1 blocks YU Q=..., YD Q=..., YE Q=..., see [\cite=Skands:2003cj]. Note that although the SLHA1 blocks provide for off-diagonal elements, only the diagonal ones will be relevant here, due to the CKM/PMNS rotation.

The entries of the [formula] CKM matrix at the scale Q. The real and imaginary parts are given in VCKM Q=... and IMVCKM Q=..., respectively. The format of the individual entries is the same as for mixing matrices in the SLHA1. Note that the complete matrix should be output, i.e., all entries should be included.

The entries of the [formula] PMNS matrix at the scale Q. The real and imaginary parts are given in UPMNS Q=... and IMUPMNS Q=..., respectively, with entries defined as for the VCKM output blocks above.

The squark and slepton masses and mixing matrices should be defined as in the existing SLHA1, e.g. extending the t̃, [formula] and [formula] mixing matrices to the 6×  6 case. More specifically, the new blocks Ru  =  USQMIX Rd  =  DSQMIX, Re  =  SELMIX and the 3  ×  3 matrix for Rν  =  SNUMIX specify the composition of the mass eigenstates in terms of the super-CKM/PMNS basis states according to the following definitions:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Note! A potential for inconsistency arises if the masses and mixings are not calculated in the same way, e.g. if radiatively corrected masses are used with tree-level mixing matrices. In this case, it is possible that the radiative corrections to the masses shift the mass ordering relative to the tree-level. This is especially relevant when near-degenerate masses occur in the spectrum and/or when the radiative corrections are large. In these cases, explicit care must be taken especially by the program writing the spectrum, but also by the one reading it, to properly arrange the rows in the order of the mass spectrum actually used.

Optionally, we allow for the possibility of the scalar and pseudoscalar components of the sneutrinos to be treated separately. In this case, we define separate PDG codes and mixing matrices for the scalar and pseudoscalar sneutrinos, as follows:

[formula]

[formula]

If present, SNSMIX and SNAMIX supersede SNUMIX.

R-Parity Violation

We write the R-parity violating superpotential in the interaction basis as

[formula]

where [formula] are fundamental SU(3)C indices and εxyz is the totally antisymmetric tensor in 3 dimensions with ε123 =  + 1. In eq. ([\ref=eq:Wrpv]), λijk,λ'ijk and κi break lepton number, whereas λ''ijk violate baryon number. To ensure proton stability, either lepton number conservation or baryon number conservation is usually still assumed, resulting in either λijk  =  λ'ijk  =  κi = 0 or λ''ijk = 0 for all i,j,k = 1,2,3.

The trilinear R-parity violating terms in the soft SUSY-breaking potential are

[formula]

Note that we do not factor out the λ couplings (e.g. as in [formula]) in order to avoid potential problems with λijk = 0 but Tijk  ≠  0. This usage is consistent with the convention for the R-conserving sector elsewhere in this report.

The bilinear R-parity violating soft terms (all lepton number violating) are

[formula]

When lepton number is not conserved the sneutrinos may acquire vacuum expectation values (VEVs) [formula]. The SLHA1 defined the VEV v, which at tree level is equal to [formula] GeV; this is now generalised to

[formula]

The addition of sneutrino VEVs allows for various different definitions of tan β, but we here choose to keep the SLHA1 definition tan β = v2 / v1.

For input/output, we use the super-CKM/PMNS basis throughout, as defined in section [\ref=sec:flv] with the following considerations specific to the R-parity violating case.

Firstly, the d-quark mass matrices are given by

[formula]

where vk are the sneutrino VEVs. Secondly, in the lepton number violating case, the PMNS matrix can only be defined consistently by taking into account the 1-loop contributions induced by the lepton-number violating couplings (see, e.g., [\cite=Hirsch:2000ef]). We here restrict our attention to scenarios in which there are no right-handed neutrinos and, thus, neutrino masses are generated solely by the lepton number violating couplings. In this case, the PMNS matrix is not an independent input but an output.

For definiteness, and to keep the changes with respect to the R-parity conserving case as limited as possible, we define the super-CKM basis as the one where the Yukawa couplings YD and YU are diagonal. The PMNS basis is defined as the basis where YE is diagonal and the loop-induced neutrino mass matrix is diagonalised. In this way one obtains a uniquely defined set of parameters:

[formula]

where the fermion mixing matrices are defined in section [\ref=sec:flv]. The Lagrangian for the quark-slepton interactions then takes the following form:

[formula]

Similarly one obtains the soft SUSY breaking couplings in this basis by replacing the superpotential quantities in eqs. ([\ref=eq:rotlam])-([\ref=eq:rotlampp]) by the corresponding soft SUSY breaking couplings. In addition we define:

[formula]

Input/Output Blocks

As mentioned above, we use the super-CKM/PMNS basis throughout, for both superpotential and soft SUSY-breaking terms. This applies to both input and output. The naming convention for input blocks is BLOCK RV#IN, where the ' #' character represents the name of the relevant output block given below (thus, for example, the "LLE" couplings in the super-PMNS basis, λ̂ijk, would be given in BLOCK RVLAMLLEIN).

Default inputs for all R-parity violating couplings are zero. The inputs are given at scale [formula], as described in SLHA1 (again, if no [formula] is given, the GUT scale is assumed), and follow the output format given below (with the omission of Q= ...). In addition, the known fermion masses should be given in SMINPUTS as defined in section [\ref=sec:flvproposal].

The dimensionless super-CKM/PMNS couplings λ̂ijk, λ̂ijk', and λ̂''ijk are given in BLOCK RVLAMLLE, RVLAMLQD, RVLAMUDD Q= ... respectively. The output standard should correspond to the FORTRAN format where the first three integers in the format correspond to i, j, and k and the double precision number is the coupling.

T̂ijk, T̂'ijk, and T̂''ijk are given in BLOCK RVTLLE, RVTLQD, RVTUDD Q= ... in the same format as for the λ̂ couplings above.

The bilinear superpotential and soft SUSY-breaking terms i, i, and [formula] and the sneutrino VEVs are given in BLOCK RVKAPPA, RVD, RVM2LH1, RVSNVEV Q= ... respectively, in the format

The input and output blocks for R-parity violating couplings are summarised in Tab. [\ref=tab:rpvSummary]. As for the R-conserving MSSM, the bilinear terms (both SUSY-breaking and SUSY-respecting ones, including μ) and the VEVs are not independent parameters. They become related by the condition of electroweak symmetry breaking. Thus, in the SLHA1, one had the possibility either to specify m2H1 and m2H2 or μ and m2A. This carries over to the  case, where not all the parameters in the input blocks RV...IN in Tab. [\ref=tab:rpvSummary] can be given simultaneously. Specifically, of the last 4 blocks only 3 are independent. One block is determined by minimising the Higgs-sneutrino potential. We do not here insist on a particular choice for which of RVKAPPAIN, RVDIN, RVSNVEVIN, and RVM2LH1IN to leave out, but leave it up to the spectrum calculators to accept one or more combinations.

Particle Mixing

In general, the neutrinos mix with the neutralinos. This requires a change in the definition of the 4  ×  4 neutralino mixing matrix N to a 7  ×  7 matrix. The Lagrangian contains the (symmetric) neutrino/neutralino mass matrix as

[formula]

in the basis of 2-component spinors ψ̃0  =   (νe,νμ,ντ, - i, - iw̃3,h̃1,h̃2)T. We define the unitary 7  ×  7 neutrino/neutralino mixing matrix N (block RVNMIX), such that:

[formula]

where the 7 (2-component) generalised neutrinos [formula] are defined strictly mass-ordered, i.e., with the 1st,2nd,3rd lightest corresponding to the mass entries for the PDG codes 12, 14, and 16, and the four heaviest to the PDG codes 1000022, 1000023, 1000025, and 1000035 (see also appendix [\ref=sec:PDG]).

Note! although these codes are normally associated with names that imply a specific flavour content, such as code 12 being [formula] and so forth, it would be exceedingly complicated to maintain such a correspondence in the context of completely general mixing, hence we do not make any such association here. The flavour content of each state, i.e., of each PDG number, is in general only defined by its corresponding entries in the mixing matrix RVNMIX. Note, however, that the flavour basis is ordered so as to reproduce the usual associations in the trivial case (modulo the unknown flavour composition of the neutrino mass eigenstates).

In the limit of CP conservation, the default convention is that N be a real matrix and one or more of the mass eigenstates may have an apparent negative mass. The minus sign may be removed by phase transformations on [formula] as explained in SLHA1 [\cite=Skands:2003cj].

Charginos and charged leptons may also mix in the case of L-violation. In a similar spirit to the neutralino mixing, we define

[formula]

in the basis of 2-component spinors ψ̃-  =   (eL,μL,τL, - iw̃- ,h̃-1)T, ψ̃+  =   (ēR,μ̄R,R, - iw̃+ ,h̃+2)T, where [formula]. Note that in the limit of no  the lepton fields are mass eigenstates.

We define the unitary 5  ×  5 charged fermion mixing matrices U,V, blocks RVUMIX, RVVMIX, such that:

[formula]

The generalised charged leptons [formula] are four-component Dirac fermions, and the left-handed and right-handed parts of ei are the two-component fermions κ-i and +i, respectively. They are defined as strictly mass ordered, i.e., with the 3 lightest states corresponding to the PDG codes 11, 13, and 15, and the two heaviest to the codes 1000024, 1000037. As for neutralino mixing, the flavour content of each state is in no way implied by its PDG number, but is only defined by its entries in RVUMIX and RVVMIX. Note, however, that the flavour basis is ordered so as to reproduce the usual associations in the trivial case. For historical reasons, codes 11, 13, and 15 pertain to the negatively charged field while codes 1000024 and 1000037 pertain to the opposite charge. The components of - in "PDG notation" would thus be (11,13,15,-1000024,-1000037). In the limit of CP conservation, U and V are chosen to be real by default.

R-parity violation via lepton number violation implies that the sneutrinos can mix with the Higgs bosons. In the limit of CP conservation the CP-even (-odd) Higgs bosons mix with real (imaginary) parts of the sneutrinos. We write the neutral scalars as [formula], with the mass term

[formula]

where M2φ0 is a 5  ×  5 symmetric mass matrix. We define the orthogonal 5  ×  5 mixing matrix [formula] (block RVHMIX) by

[formula]

where [formula] are the neutral scalar mass eigenstates in strictly increasing mass order (that is, we use the label h for any neutral scalar mass eigenstate, regardless of whether it is more "Higgs-like" or "sneutrino-like"). The states are numbered sequentially by the PDG codes (25,35,1000012,1000014,1000016), regardless of flavour content. The same convention will be followed below for the neutral pseudoscalars and the charged scalars.

We write the neutral pseudo-scalars as [formula], with the mass term

[formula]

where M20 is a 5  ×  5 symmetric mass matrix. We define the 4  ×  5 mixing matrix [formula] (block RVAMIX) by

[formula]

where [formula] are the pseudoscalar mass eigenstates, again in strictly increasing mass order. The states are numbered sequentially by the PDG codes (36,1000017, 1000018,1000019), regardless of flavour composition. The Goldstone boson G0 (the "5th component") has been explicitly left out and the 4 rows of [formula] form a set of orthonormal vectors.

If the blocks RVHMIX, RVAMIX are present, they supersede the SLHA1 ALPHA variable/block.

The charged sleptons and charged Higgs bosons also mix in the 8  ×  8 mass squared matrix M2φ± by a 7  ×  8 matrix C (block RVLMIX):

[formula]

where i,j,k,l∈{1,2,3}, [formula] and [formula]; these states are numbered sequentially by the PDG codes (37,1000011,1000013,1000015, 2000011,2000013,2000015), regardless of flavour composition. The Goldstone boson G+ (the "8th component") has been explicitly left out and the 7 rows of C form a set of orthonormal vectors.

R-parity violation may also generate contributions to down-squark mixing via additional left-right mixing terms,

[formula]

where vk are the sneutrino vevs. However, this only mixes the six down-type squarks amongst themselves and so is identical to the effects of flavour mixing. This is covered in section [\ref=sec:flv] (along with other forms of flavour mixing).

CP Violation

When adding CP violation to the MSSM model parameters and mixing matrices (for a recent review see, e.g., the CPNSH report [\cite=CPV-Accomando:2006ga]), the SLHA1 blocks are understood to contain the real parts of the relevant parameters. The imaginary parts should be provided with exactly the same format, in a separate block of the same name but prefaced by IM. The defaults for all imaginary parameters will be zero. Thus, for example, BLOCK IMAU, IMAD, IMAE, Q= ... would describe the imaginary parts of the trilinear soft SUSY-breaking scalar couplings. For input, BLOCK IMEXTPAR may be used to provide the relevant imaginary parts of soft SUSY-breaking inputs. In cases where the definitions of the current paper supersede the SLHA1 input and output blocks, completely equivalent statements apply.

One special case is the μ parameter. When the real part of μ is given in EXTPAR 23, the imaginary part should be given in IMEXTPAR 23, as above. However, when |μ| is determined by the conditions for electroweak symmetry breaking, only the phase φμ is taken as an input parameter. In this case, SLHA2 generalises the entry MINPAR 4 to contain the cosine of the phase (as opposed to just [formula] in SLHA1), and we further introduce a new block IMMINPAR whose entry 4 gives the sine of the phase, that is:

BLOCK MINPAR

:

BLOCK IMMINPAR

:

Note that cos φμ coincides with [formula] in the CP-conserving case.

When CP symmetry is broken, quantum corrections cause mixing between the CP-even and CP-odd Higgs states. Writing the neutral scalar interaction eigenstates as [formula] [formula] [formula] [formula] we define the 3  ×  4 mixing matrix S (blocks CVHMIX and IMCVHMIX) by

[formula]

where [formula] are the mass eigenstates; these states are numbered sequentially by the PDG codes (25,35,36), regardless of flavour composition. That is, even though the PDG reserves code 36 for the CP-odd state, we do not maintain such a labelling here, nor one that reduces to it. This means one does have to exercise some caution when taking the CP conserving limit.

The matrix S thus gives the decomposition of the three physical mass eigenstates in terms of the four interaction eigenstates, all in one go, with the Goldstone boson G0 explicitly projected out and the 3 rows of S forming a set of orthonormal vectors.

For comparison, in the literature, the projecting-out of the Goldstone boson is often done as a separate step, by first performing a rotation by the angle β. (This is, for instance, the prescription followed by CPsuperH [\cite=Lee:2003nta]). In such an approach, our matrix S would be decomposed as:

[formula]

where [formula] gives the decomposition of the three physical mass eigenstates in terms of the intermediate basis [formula], with A0tree denoting the tree-level MSSM non-Goldstone pseudoscalar mass eigenstate. Note that a simple rotation by β suffices to translate between the two conventions, so whichever is the more practical can easily be used.

A second alternative convention,e.g. adopted by FeynHiggs [\cite=Heinemeyer:1998yj] [\cite=Frank:2006yh], is to also rotate the CP-even states by the angle α as part of the first step. In this case, our matrix S would be decomposed as:

[formula]

with α defined as the mixing angle in the CP-even Higgs sector at tree-level and [formula] giving the decomposition of the three physical mass eigenstates in terms of the intermediate basis 0 = (h0,H0,A0)Ttree, that is in terms of the the tree-level mass eigenstates. In order to translate between S and R3  ×  3, the tree-level angle α would thus also be needed. This should be given in the SLHA1 output BLOCK ALPHA:

BLOCK ALPHA

For the neutralino and chargino mixing matrices, the default convention in SLHA1 (and hence for the CP conserving case) is that they be real matrices. One or more mass eigenvalues may then have an apparent negative sign, which can be removed by a phase transformation on i as explained in SLHA1 [\cite=Skands:2003cj]. When going to CPV, the reason for introducing the negative-mass convention in the first place, namely maintaining the mixing matrices strictly real, disappears. We therefore here take all masses real and positive, with N, U, and V complex. This does lead to a nominal dissimilarity with SLHA1 in the limit of vanishing CP violation, but we note that the explicit CPV switch in MODSEL can be used to decide unambiguously which convention to follow.

The Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric SM

The first question to be addressed in defining universal conventions for the next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard model is just what field content and which couplings this name should apply to. The field content is already fairly well agreed upon; we shall here define the next-to-minimal case as having exactly the field content of the MSSM with the addition of one gauge-singlet chiral superfield. As to couplings and parameterisations, several definitions exist in the literature (for a recent review see, e.g., the CPNSH report [\cite=NMSSM-Accomando:2006ga]). Rather than adopting a particular one, or treating each special case separately, below we choose instead to work at the most general level. Any particular special case can then be obtained by setting different combinations of couplings to zero. For the time being, however, we do specialise to the SLHA1-like case without CP violation, R-parity violation, or flavour violation. Below, we shall use the acronym NMSSM for this class of models, but we emphasise that we understand it to relate to field content only, and not to the presence or absence of specific couplings.

Conventions

We write the most general CP conserving NMSSM superpotential as (extending the notation of SLHA1):

[formula]

where WMSSM is the MSSM superpotential, eq. ([\ref=eq:wmssm]). A non-zero λ in combination with a VEV [formula] of the singlet generates a contribution to the effective μ term [formula], where the MSSM μ term is normally assumed to be zero in NMSSM constructions, yielding [formula]. The sign of the λ term in eq. ([\ref=eq:nmssmsup]) coincides with the one in [\cite=Ellwanger:2005dv] [\cite=Ellwanger:2004xm] where the Higgs doublet superfields appear in opposite order. The remaining terms represent a general cubic potential for the singlet; κ is dimensionless, μ' has dimension of mass, and ξF has dimension of mass squared. The soft SUSY-breaking terms relevant to the NMSSM are

[formula]

where Vi,MSSM are the MSSM soft terms defined in eqs. ([\ref=eq:slha1v3soft]) and ([\ref=eq:slha1v2soft]), and we have introduced the notation [formula].

At tree level, there are thus 15 parameters (in addition to mZ which fixes the sum of the squared Higgs VEVs) that are relevant for the Higgs sector of the R-parity and CP-conserving NMSSM:

[formula]

The minimisation of the effective potential imposes 3 conditions on these parameters, such that only 12 of them can be considered independent. We leave it up to each spectrum calculator to decide on which combinations to accept. For the purpose of this accord, we note only that to specify a general model exactly 12 parameters from eq. ([\ref=eq:nmssmpar]) should be provided in the input, including explicit zeroes for parameters desired "switched off". However, since μ = m23  =  μ' = mS'2  =  ξF  =  ξS = 0 in the majority of phenomenological constructions, for convenience we also allow for a six-parameter specification in terms of the reduced parameter list:

[formula]

To summarise, in addition to mZ, the input to the accord should contain either 12 parameters from the list given in eq. ([\ref=eq:nmssmpar]), including zeroes for parameters not present in the desired model, or it should contain 6 parameters from the list in eq. ([\ref=eq:nmssmpar-reduced]), in which case the remaining 6 "non-standard" parameters, μ, m23, μ', mS'2, ξF, and ξF, will be assumed to be zero; in both cases the 3 unspecified parameters (as, e.g., m2H1, m2H2, and m2S) are assumed to be determined by the minimisation of the effective potential.

Input/Output Blocks

Firstly, as described above in section [\ref=sec:modelselection], BLOCK MODSEL should contain the switch 3 with value 1, corresponding to the choice of the NMSSM particle content.

Secondly, for the parameters that are also present in the MSSM, we re-use the corresponding SLHA1 entries. That is, mZ should be given in SMINPUTS entry 4 and m2H1,m2H2 can be given in the EXTPAR entries 21 and 22. tan β should either be given in MINPAR entry 3 (default) or EXTPAR entry 25 (user-defined input scale), as in SLHA1. If μ should be desired non-zero, it can be given in EXTPAR entry 23. The corresponding soft parameter m23 can be given in EXTPAR entry 24, in the form m23 / ( cos β sin β), see [\cite=Skands:2003cj]. The notation m2A that was used for that parameter in the SLHA1 is no longer relevant in the NMSSM context, but by keeping the definition in terms of m23 and cos β sin β unchanged, we maintain an economical and straightforward correspondence between the two cases.

Further, new entries in BLOCK EXTPAR have been defined for the NMSSM specific input parameters, as follows. As in the SLHA1, these parameters are all given at the common scale , which can either be left up to the spectrum calculator or given explicitly using EXTPAR 0 or QEXTPAR (see section [\ref=sec:slha1]):

BLOCK EXTPAR

Important note: only 12 of the parameters listed in eq. ([\ref=eq:nmssmpar]) should be given as input at any one time (including explicit zeroes for parameters desired "switched off"), the remaining ones being determined by the minimisation of the effective potential. Which combinations to accept is left up to the individual spectrum calculator programs. Alternatively, for minimal models, 6 parameters of those listed in eq. ([\ref=eq:nmssmpar-reduced]) should be given.

For non-zero values, signs can be either positive or negative. As noted above, the meaning of the already existing entries EXTPAR 23 and 24 (the MSSM μ parameter and corresponding soft term) are maintained, which allows, in principle, for non-zero values for both μ and [formula]. The reason for choosing [formula] rather than [formula] as input parameter 65 is that it allows more easily to recover the MSSM limit λ, κ  →  0, [formula] with [formula] fixed.

In the spectrum output, running NMSSM parameters corresponding to the EXTPAR entries above can be given in the block NMSSMRUN Q=...:

BLOCK NMSSMRUN Q=...

Output parameters specific to the NMSSM, given in the  scheme, at the scale Q. As in the SLHA1, several of these blocks may be given simultaneously in the output, each then corresponding to a specific scale. See corresponding entries in EXTPAR above for definitions.

Particle Mixing

In the CP-conserving NMSSM, the CP-even interaction eigenstates are [formula]. We define the orthogonal 3  ×  3 mixing matrix S (block NMHMIX) by

[formula]

where [formula] are the mass eigenstates ordered in mass. These states are numbered sequentially by the PDG codes (25,35,45). The format of BLOCK NMHMIX is the same as for the mixing matrices in SLHA1.

In the MSSM limit (λ, κ  →  0, and parameters such that [formula]) the elements of the first 2  ×  2 sub-matrix of Sij are related to the MSSM angle α as

[formula]

In the CP-odd sector the interaction eigenstates are [formula]. We define the 2  ×  3 mixing matrix P (block NMAMIX) by

[formula]

where [formula] are the mass eigenstates ordered in mass. These states are numbered sequentially by the PDG codes (36,46). The Goldstone boson G0 (the "3rd component") has been explicitly left out and the 2 rows of P form a set of orthonormal vectors. An updated version NMSSMTools [\cite=Ellwanger:2005dv] will follow these conventions.

If NMHMIX, NMAMIX blocks are present, they supersede the SLHA1 ALPHA variable/block.

The neutralino sector of the NMSSM requires a change in the definition of the 4  ×  4 neutralino mixing matrix N to a 5  ×  5 matrix. The Lagrangian contains the (symmetric) neutralino mass matrix as

[formula]

in the basis of 2-component spinors ψ̃0  =   ( - i, - iw̃3, h̃1, h̃2, s̃)T. We define the unitary 5  ×  5 neutralino mixing matrix N (block NMNMIX), such that:

[formula]

where the 5 (2-component) neutralinos [formula] are defined such that the absolute value of their masses increase with i. As in SLHA1, our convention is that N be a real matrix. One or more mass eigenvalues may then have an apparent negative sign, which can be removed by a phase transformation on i. The states are numbered sequentially by the PDG codes (1000022,1000023,1000025,1000035,1000045).

Conclusion and Outlook

At the time of writing of the SLHA1, a large number of computer codes already existed which used MSSM spectrum and coupling information in one form or another. This had several advantages: there was a high motivation from program authors to produce and implement the accord accurately and quickly, and perhaps more importantly, the SLHA1 was tested "in anger" in diverse situations as it was being written.

We find ourselves in a slightly different situation in terms of the SLHA2. There are currently few programs that utilise information in any of the NMSSM or CP-violating, R-parity violating, or non-trivial flavour violating MSSM scenarios. Thus we do not have the benefit of comprehensive simultaneous testing of the proposed accord and the strong motivation that was present for implementation and writing of the original one. What we do have are the lessons learned in connection with the SLHA1 itself, and also several almost-finished codes which are now awaiting the finalisation of SLHA2 in order to publish their first official releases. Concrete tests involving several of these were thus possible in connection with this writeup.

We have adhered to the principle of backward compatibility wherever feasible. We therefore expect that the conventions and agreements reached within this paper constitute a practical solution that will prove useful for SUSY particle phenomenology in the future.

PDG Codes and Extensions

The existing PDG nomenclature for (s)particle names is based on the limit of the MSSM in which CP, R-parity, and flavour are conserved. Several of the mass eigenstates are therefore labeled to indicate definite R, CP, and/or flavour quantum numbers. When the corresponding symmetries are broken, such a labeling becomes misleading. Throughout this paper we have adopted the convention of assigning a common label to all states which carry identical conserved quantum numbers in the given model. We then re-use the existing PDG codes for those states, arranged in strictly increasing mass order.

This implies that, while the PDG numbers remain unaltered, their labels change, depending on which scenario is considered. The PDG codes and labels are discussed in detail in the individual sections on flavour violation, R-parity violation, CP violation, and the NMSSM. In the tables below, we summarise the PDG numbers and suggested labels relevant to each distinct scenario, for squarks (Tab. [\ref=tab:pdg1]), charged colour-singlet fermions (Tab. [\ref=tab:pdg2]), neutral colour-singlet fermions (Tab. [\ref=tab:pdg22]), charged colour-singlet scalars (Tab. [\ref=tab:pdg3]), and neutral colour-singlet scalars (Tab. [\ref=tab:pdg4]), respectively. Note that these extensions are not officially endorsed by the PDG at this time. Codes for other particles can be found in [\cite=Yao:2006px].
