Introduction.

Let p be a prime, m be a natural number, [formula] be the finite field of order q = pm, and [formula] be the multiplicative group of [formula], so that [formula]. For sets [formula], [formula], and for a (possibly, partial) binary operation [formula] we let

[formula]

We will write XY instead of X * Y if *   is multiplication in the field; and, for an element [formula], we write

[formula]

[formula]

For a set [formula] and [formula] let

[formula]

[formula]

Let also denote the cardinality of the given set X as |X|. For given natural numbers N the notation NXY should be understood as N-fold sum of the product set XY. Let us consider the following definitions.

The set X is said to be symmetric if X =  - X.

The set X is said to be antisymmetric if [formula]

A set A is called an (additive) basis of order k (for [formula]) if [formula]. Observe that any basis of order k is also a basis of any order k' > k. The general problem that will be discussed in this paper is whether, for given integers t < q,N and two sets A and B, the set AB is a basis of order N if |A||B|  ≥  t?

The first machinery, allowing one to prove sum-product results on finite fields was developed in the paper of J. Bourgain, N. Katz and T. Tao([\cite=BKT]).

The author of this paper proved the following two statements([\cite=Gl], Theorems 1 and 2).

Let A and B be subsets of the field [formula] for some prime p. If the set B is antisymmetric and |A||B| > p then [formula]

Let A and B be subsets of the field [formula] for some prime p. If the set B is symmetric and |A||B| > p then [formula]

In the joint paper with S.V. Konyagin([\cite=GK], Lemmas 2.1 and 2.2 )we established the following two results.

If [formula], [formula] for some prime p, and |A|  ·  ⌈|B| / 2⌉ > p then [formula].

If [formula], [formula] for some prime p, and |A||B| > p then [formula].

In this paper extensions of Theorems [\ref=first8AB1]-[\ref=first16AB] will be obtained. We shall establish the following four theorems.

Theorem [\ref=thm:Bisantysymm] If [formula] and [formula] are such that B is antisymmetric and |A||B| > q then [formula]

Theorem [\ref=thm:Bissumm] Assume that [formula] and [formula] are such that B is symmetric. If also |A||B| > q then [formula]

Theorem [\ref=main] Let [formula] be arbitrary subsets with |A||B| > q. Then we have [formula]

Theorem [\ref=main1] Let [formula] be arbitrary subsets with [formula] Then we have [formula]

Constant 16 in the Theorem [\ref=main] is most likely not best possible, it is demonstrated by Theorem [\ref=main1] and recent result of D. Hart and A. Iosevich([\cite=IH]). They established that

For every subset [formula] such that [formula] for C sufficiently large the identity [formula] holds.

Applying Theorem [\ref=HI] with d = 1 we see that the constant in the Theorem [\ref=main] can be significantly improved when A = B and [formula] D. Hart and A. Iosevich in the same paper have conjectured that if [formula] for some constant Cε and ε > 0 then [formula] However, condition |A||B| > q in the Theorem [\ref=main] is sharp. Indeed, if |A||B| = q then result similar to the Theorem [\ref=main] cannot hold. It is sufficient to consider sets [formula] or make A = B to be a subfield of order [formula] when q = pm and m is even, to verify this statement. To construct a less trivial counterexample let us consider two natural numbers k and l such that k + l = m. Let us take a primitive element [formula] and consider sets

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

where [formula] is a subfield of [formula] of cardinality p. Then one can obviously observe that |A||B| = q, [formula] and C is closed under addition.

Preliminary results.

Lemmas [\ref=technical], [\ref=required], [\ref=IABlemma] are extensions of Lemmas 1, 2, 3 from [\cite=Gl]. Their proofs are due to arguments used in corresponding lemmas.

Let [formula], [formula] be arbitrary nonempty subsets. Then there is an element [formula] such that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Proof. Let us consider an arbitrary elements [formula] and [formula] Denote

[formula]

[formula]

It obviously follows that

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Therefore, [formula] and it is enough to consider only sum with values of f+ξ(s). It is easy to see that for every a1,a2∈A and b1,b2∈B with a1  ≠  a2 there is only one element η  ≠  0 such that a1 + b1η = a2 + b2η. Thus,

[formula]

Therefore, there is [formula] such that

[formula]

By Cauchy-Schwartz

[formula]

[formula]

Moreover, it obviously follows that

[formula]

[formula]

Now from ([\ref=eqn:sum_sfplus]), ([\ref=eqn:causchwcoroll1]) and ([\ref=eqn:causchwcoroll2]) one can deduce a desired inequality:

[formula]

and

[formula]

Lemma 1 is proved. [formula]

Let A and B be subsets of field [formula] with |A||B| > q. Then there is [formula] such that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Proof. Let us apply Lemma [\ref=technical]. It states that there is [formula] such that ([\ref=eqn:AplusxiBislarge]) and ([\ref=eqn:AminusxiBislarge]) hold. Clearly, we have

[formula]

Let us consider the difference

[formula]

It is clear that s > 0 when |A||B| > q and q  ≠  2. If q = 2 then the condition |A||B| > q implies that at least one of the subsets A or B is equal to [formula] Lemma [\ref=required] is proved. [formula]

For two subsets [formula] denote

[formula]

Consider two subsets [formula] and [formula]. If for some [formula]

[formula]

then

[formula]

Proof. If |A + ξB| < |A||B| then there are elements a1,a2∈A and b1,b2∈B such that (a1,b1)  ≠  (a2,b2) and

[formula]

It is clear that b1  ≠  b2. Let us consider the set

[formula]

It is obviously follows that |S| = |A + ξB| and every element of S can be rewritten in the form

[formula]

with a∈A and b∈B. From ([\ref=eqn:nontriverelation]) one can easily deduce that

[formula]

Therefore, S  ⊂  I(A,B) and lemma follows. [formula]

Assume that [formula] with [formula] then [formula]

Proof. Let us take an arbitrary element [formula] and consider a set x - X. From [formula] one can obviously prove that sets x - X and X have nonempty intersection, so there are elements x1,x2∈X such that x - x1 = x2  ⇔  x = x1 + x2. Lemma now follows. [formula]

Let A be any subset of [formula] If [formula] then there is a symmetric or antisymmetric subset S  ⊂  A with [formula]. If [formula] then one can find either symmetric or antisymmetric subset S  ⊂  A with [formula]

Proof. Let us define a set A1  =  {x∈A: - x∉A}. It is an antisymmetric subset of A. Consider a set of subsets S  =  {{a1,a2}:a1∈A,a2∈A,a1 =  - a2}. It is clear that one can choose one element from each of the sets from S and form a new set A2 from those elements. It is easy to observe that [formula] 0∈A2 if 0∈A and [formula] is antisymmetric. Let us define a subset [formula] It is an antisymmetric subset of A with cardinality |A3| = |A2| - 1 if 0∈A and |A3| = |A2| otherwise, such that 0∉A3 and [formula] is the maximal symmetric subset of A. We have split the set A into three nonintersecting parts: [formula].

If [formula] then [formula] and Lemma [\ref=AplusAhaslargeregsub] follows with symmetric [formula].

If 0∉A and [formula] then |A2| = |A3| and [formula]. Assuming S to be an antisymmetric subset [formula] we complete the proof of Lemma [\ref=AplusAhaslargeregsub].

Assume that [formula] and 0∈A. If [formula] then [formula] and Lemma [\ref=AplusAhaslargeregsub] is proved by letting S to be antisymmetric subset [formula].

It is left to prove Lemma [\ref=AplusAhaslargeregsub] when

[formula]

[formula]

and 0∈A. Let us consider three cases.

Case 1. |A| = 3k for some natural k. Taking into account ([\ref=eqn:A1isbig]) and ([\ref=eqn:A3issmall]) one can see that [formula] and therefore [formula] By defining [formula] (S is antisymmetric) we complete the proof of Lemma [\ref=AplusAhaslargeregsub].

Case 2. |A| = 3k + 1 for some natural k. Again, using ([\ref=eqn:A1isbig]) and ([\ref=eqn:A3issmall]) one can deduce that [formula]. If [formula] then assuming [formula] we get a required antisymmetric subset. If |A3| = k then |A2| = k + 1 and |A1| = k. Note that the identity |A1| = k contradicts inequality ([\ref=eqn:A1isbig]). We are done.

Case 3. |A| = 3k + 2 for some natural k. Using ([\ref=eqn:A1isbig]) and ([\ref=eqn:A3issmall]) one can easily deduce that [formula] and [formula]. If [formula] then [formula]. Letting S to be an antisymmetric subset [formula] we observe that [formula] and we are done with better bound on |S|. In case when |A3| = k it is easy to see that |A2| = k + 1 and |A1| = k + 1. Assuming S to be a symmetric subset [formula] we complete the proof of Lemma [\ref=AplusAhaslargeregsub]. [formula]

For every subset [formula] its symmetry group (it is denoted as Sym1(X)) is defined by the identity

[formula]

We shall use the following theorem (see [\cite=TV], theorem 5.5 or [\cite=Kn]).

(Kneser) For every subsets [formula] we have

[formula]

[formula]

Given a subset [formula] Let us take any subgroup G of the group Sym1(X). Then X is a union of additive cosets of G.

Proof. One can easily observe that Sym1(X) is an additive subgroup. It is sufficient to prove that every coset of the subgroup G either is a subset of X or has an empty intersection with X. Suppose that some coset x + G has nonempty intersection with X. Let us take an arbitrary element [formula]. By definition of y a coset y + G = x + G, but from symmetry of X it follows that y + G  ⊂  X. Lemma [\ref=symetrystruct] is proved. [formula]

Let B be an arbitrary subset of [formula] such that [formula] Then one of the following two alternatives holds

[formula]

there is an additive subgroup [formula] such that B  ⊂  b + G for some b∈B and [formula]. Moreover, in this case B + B = 2b + G.

Proof. Application of Theorem [\ref=Kneser] for sets X = Y = B implies

[formula]

Since Sym1(B + B) is an additive subgroup of [formula] then there is an integer [formula] such that |Sym1(B + B)| = pl. Observe that Sym1(B + B)  ⊂  Sym1(B + Sym1(B + B)). Now from Lemma [\ref=symetrystruct] clearly follows that |B + Sym1(B + B)| = mpl for some natural m. Again, using ([\ref=eqn:kneserapp]) we can see that

[formula]

Assume that the inequality [formula] holds. Then we deduce from ([\ref=eqn:kneserapp]) that

[formula]

and therefore [formula] Combining the last inequality with ([\ref=eqn:AplusAwithm]) we obtain the condition 2m - 1 < 3 and therefore m can take on one value: m = 1. When m = 1 one can observe that |B + Sym1(B + B)| = |Sym1(B + B)| = pl. Take an arbitrary element b∈B and consider the set B' = B - b. It is clear, that B' + Sym1(B + B) = Sym1(B + B) and therefore B'  ⊂  Sym1(B + B). Recalling definition of B' we obtain a relation B  ⊂  b + Sym1(B + B). By ([\ref=eqn:AplusAwithm]) one can deduce the inequality [formula] Observing that B + B  ⊂  2b + Sym1(B + B) we can obtain the relation |B + B| = |Sym1(B + B)| = pl. Now it is clear that if [formula] then the inequality [formula] holds, otherwise we get the alternative (ii). To finish the proof of the Lemma [\ref=AplusAislarge] we need to observe that according to Lemma [\ref=Abigsumbig] B + B = 2b + Sym1(B + B) when [formula] Lemma [\ref=AplusAislarge] now follows. [formula]

Proofs of theorems [\ref=thm:Bisantysymm]-[\ref=main1].

If [formula] and [formula] are such that B is antisymmetric and |A||B| > q then [formula]

Proof. Let us apply Lemma [\ref=required]. It states that there is an element [formula] such that ([\ref=eqn:AplusxiBqhalf]) and ([\ref=eqn:AminusxiBqhalf]) hold. From ([\ref=eqn:AplusxiBqhalf]) one can easily derive that [formula] and, therefore, there are elements a1,a2∈A,b1,b2∈B with a1 + b1ξ =  - (a2 + b2ξ). Thus,

[formula]

The expression ([\ref=eqn:localexprforxi]) is correct because [formula] and denominator of the fraction in this formula is not equal to zero. From ([\ref=eqn:AminusxiBqhalf]) it follows that

[formula]

[formula]

Therefore, [formula] and Lemma [\ref=Abigsumbig] gives us the desired statement. [formula]

Assume that [formula] and [formula] are such that B is symmetric. If also |A||B| > q then [formula]

Proof. Applying Lemma [\ref=required] one can find an element [formula] such that [formula]. Moreover, from restrictions on sets A and B one can see that [formula] and we can apply Lemma [\ref=IABlemma] that gives us the following:

[formula]

Taking into account that B =  - B one can derive that I(A,B)  ⊂  4AB and [formula] Now Theorem [\ref=thm:Bissumm] follows from Lemma [\ref=Abigsumbig]. [formula]

Let [formula] be arbitrary subsets with |A||B| > q. Then we have [formula]

Proof. Let us apply Lemma [\ref=AplusAislarge] for the set B. If (ii) holds then B + B = 2b + G for some b∈B and an additive subgroup [formula]. It is easy to see that every coset of an additive subgroup is an antisymmetric or a symmetric subset. Then application of Theorem [\ref=thm:Bisantysymm] or Theorem [\ref=thm:Bissumm] for sets A and B + B gives us Theorem [\ref=main].

Assume now that

[formula]

i. e. alternative (i) holds. If [formula] then application of Lemma [\ref=AplusAhaslargeregsub] gives us a subset S  ⊂  B + B such that [formula] and S is either symmetric or antisymmetric. By ([\ref=eqn:alerntwo]) we observe that [formula]. Application of Theorem [\ref=thm:Bisantysymm] or Theorem [\ref=thm:Bissumm] for sets A and S allows one deduce Theorem [\ref=main].

It is left to consider the case when [formula] and the inequality ([\ref=eqn:alerntwo]) holds. Assume that |B + B| = 3k + 2 for some natural k. Lemma [\ref=AplusAhaslargeregsub] states that there is either symmetric or antisymmetric subset S  ⊂  B + B with [formula] Moreover, by ([\ref=eqn:alerntwo]) we can deduce that [formula] and, therefore [formula]. Now it is easy to see that [formula] Using Theorem [\ref=thm:Bisantysymm] or Theorem [\ref=thm:Bissumm] for sets A and S we complete the proof of Theorem [\ref=main]. [formula]

Let [formula] be arbitrary subsets with [formula] Then we have [formula]

Proof. Our aim is to extract from the set B a sufficiently large symmetric or antisymmetric subset S  ⊂  B. Lemma [\ref=AplusAhaslargeregsub] states that there is a symmetric or antisymmetric subset S  ⊂  B with [formula]. Let us notice that the equality |B| = 2 holds when |A||B| = 2q and, therefore, [formula], so we can assume that |B| > 2. Observe that in this case [formula] and we have [formula] and Theorem [\ref=main1] now follows from Theorems [\ref=thm:Bisantysymm] and [\ref=thm:Bissumm]. [formula]
