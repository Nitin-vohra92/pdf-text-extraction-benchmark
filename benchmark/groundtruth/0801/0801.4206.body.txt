Introduction

Let π be a set of primes. We denote by π' the set of all primes not in π, by π(n) the set of prime divisors of a positive integer n, while for a finite group G by π(G) we denote π(|G|). A positive integer n with π(n)  ⊆  π is called a π-number, whole a group G π(G)  ⊆  π is called a π-group. A subgroup H of G is called a π-Hall subgroup, if π(H)  ⊆  π by π(|G:H|)  ⊆  π'. According to [\cite=Hall] we shall say that G has the property Eπ (or briefly G∈Eπ), if G contains a π-Hall subgroup. If we also have that every two π-Hall subgroups are conjugate, then we shall say that G has the property Cπ (G∈Cπ). If we have further that each π-subgroup of G is contained in a π-Hall subgroup, then we shall say that G has the property Dπ (G∈Dπ). A group with the property Eπ (Cπ, Dπ) we shall call also an Eπ- (respectively a Cπ-, a Dπ-) group. The expression (mod CFSG) means that the corresponding result is proved by using the classification of finite simple groups.

Assume that a set π is fixed. It is proved that the class of all Dπ-groups is closed under homomorphic images, normal subgroups (mod CFSG, [\cite=RevVdoDpiFinal]) and extensions (mod CFSG, [\cite=RevVdoDpiFinal]). The class of Eπ-groups is also known to be closed under normal subgroups and homomorphic images (see Lemma [\ref=base](1)), but, in general, it is not closed under extensions (see Example 1). The class of Cπ-groups is closed under homomorphic images (mod CFSG, see Lemma [\ref=quot]) and extensions (see Lemma [\ref=cpiext]), but, in general, is not closed under normal subgroups (see Example 2). Nevertheless, while proving statements about Hall properties one need to know in which cases an extension of an Eπ-group by an Eπ-group has the property Eπ, and a normal subgroup of a Cπ-group has the property Cπ. In the present paper we prove by using the classification of finite simple groups

Since every π'-group has the property Cπ and the class of Cπ-groups is closed under extensions, the following statement is immediate from Theorem [\ref=MainTheorem] (cf. Example 2).

The proof of Theorem [\ref=MainTheorem] is based on the following result about the number of classes of π-Hall subgroups in finite simple groups.

In view of Theorem [\ref=MainTheorem] note that the authors do not know any counter example to the following conjecture.

In the conjecture the condition that A contains a π-Hall subgroup of G cannot be weeken by substituting it with condition that the index of A is a π'-number. Indeed, consider [formula], where q - 1 is divisible by 12 and is not divisible by 24. In view of [\cite=RevVdoDpiFinal] the group [formula] is a C{2,3}-group and its {2,3}-Hall subgroup is contained in a monomial subgroup. On the other hand the group Ω7(2) is known to be embeddable into [formula] and, under above mentioned conditions on q, it index is not divisible by 2 and by 3. Although Ω7(2) does not contain {2,3}-Hall subgroups, i. e., it is not even a E{2,3}-group.

Notations and preliminary results

By π we always denote a set of primes, and the term group always means a finite group.

For a group G, a G-class of π-Hall subgroups is a class of conjugate π-Hall subgroups of G. Let A be a subnormal subgroup of a Eπ-group G. A subgroup of A of type [formula], where H is a π-Hall subgroup of G, we shall call a G-induced π-Hall subgroup of A. Thus a set [formula], where H is a π-Hall subgroup of G is called an A-class of G-induced π-Hall subgroups. By kGπ(A) we denote the number of all A-classes of G-induced π-Hall subgroups. Assume also that kπ(G) = kGπ(G) is the number of conjugacy classes of π-Hall subgroups of G. It is clear that [formula].

Let [formula] and for each [formula] by [formula] we denote an Ai-class of π-Hall subgroups of Ai. The set

[formula]

is called a product of classes [formula]. Clearly [formula] is an A-class of π-Hall subgroups of A. It is also clear that if A is a normal subgroup of G, then each A-classes of G-induced π-Hall subgroups is a product of some A1-, [formula], As- classes of G-induced π-Hall subgroups. The reverse statement, in general, is not true.

The following statements are known and their proof does not use the classification of finite simple groups.

Let A be a normal subgroup of G. Then the following statements hold.

(1) If H is a π-Hall subgroup of G, then [formula] is a π-Hall subgroup of A, and HA / A is a π-Hall subgroup of G / A.

(2) If all factors of a subnormal series of G are either π- or π'- groups, then G∈Dπ.

Let A be a normal subgroup of G. If A and G / A has the property Cπ, then G∈Cπ.

Example 1. {Let π  =  {2,3}. Let [formula] be a group of order 168 = 23  ·  3  ·  7. From [\cite=RevHallp] or [\cite=Atlas] it follows that G has exactly two classes of π-Hall subgroups with representatives

[formula]

The first one consists of line stabilizers in the natural representation of G, and the second one consists of plain stabilizers. The map ι:x∈G  ↦  (xt)- 1, where xt means the transposed matrix to x, is an automorphism of order 2 of G. It interchange classes of π-Hall subgroups. If [formula] is a natural semidirect product, then NĜ(H) = NG(H) = H for each π-Hall subgroup H of G, since each element from [formula] interchanges classes of π-Hall subgroups, like ι does, and H is maximal. The group Ĝ has order [formula] and has no the property Eπ. Indeed, if there would exist a π-Hall subgroup Ĥ, then by Lemma [\ref=base](1) there would also exist a π-Hall subgroup H of G, with [formula]. But this implies [formula], and so [formula], that contradicts the condition that Ĥ is a π-Hall subgroup.

Example 2. Let π  =  {2,3}. Let [formula] be a group of order 99999360 = 210  ·  32  ·  5  ·  7  ·  31. Let ι:x∈G  ↦  (xt)- 1 and [formula] be a natural semidirect product. From [\cite=RevHallp] it follows that there exist π-Hall subgroups of G, and every such a subgroup is a stabilizer of a series of subspaces V = V0 < V1 < V2 < V3 = V, where V is a natural module of G, and dim Vk / Vk - 1∈{1,2} for every k = 1,2,3. Therefore, there are three conjugacy classes of π-Hall subgroups of G with representatives

[formula]

[formula]

Note that NG(Hk) = Hk, k = 1,2,3, since Hk is parabolic. The class containing H1 is ι-invariant. So Frattini argument implies that Ĝ = GNĜ(H1), whence |NĜ(H1):NG(H1)| = 2 and so NĜ(H1) is a π-Hall subgroup of Ĝ. ι interchanges classes containing H2 and H3. So, as in the previous example, these subgroups are not contained in π-Hall subgroups of Ĝ. Thus Ĝ contains exactly one class of π-Hall subgroups, therefore has the property Cπ, while its normal subgroup G has no this property.

([\cite=Ved], mod CFSG) Let A be a normal subgroup of an Eπ-group G, B be a subgroup of G such that A  ≤  B and B / A∈Eπ. Then B∈Eπ.

It is immediate from Lemma [\ref=Vedernik] that the property Cπ is preserved under homomorphisms and we shall give the proof here for completeness. Note that since Lemma [\ref=Vedernik] is proved by using the classification of finite simple groups, then Lemma [\ref=quot] is also proved by using the classification of finite simple groups.

Let A be a normal subgroup of a Cπ-group G. Then G / A∈Cπ.

Let [formula]. Since all π-Hall subgroups of G are conjugate, it is enough to prove that for every π-Hall subgroup [formula] of [formula] there exists a π-Hall subgroup U of G such that [formula]. The existence of such a subgroup U follows from Lemma [\ref=Vedernik]. Indeed, for K being the complete preimage of [formula], the group [formula] has the property Eπ. So K has the property Eπ, and its π-Hall subgroup U is a π-Hall subgroup of G. By construction, [formula].

Let A be a normal and H be a π-Hall subgroups of a Cπ-group G. Then each of groups NG(HA) and [formula] has the property Cπ.

Let K be a π-Hall subgroup of NG(HA). Since [formula] and |NG(HA):HA| is a π'-number, then K  ≤  HA and KA = HA. If x∈G is such that K = Hx, then (HA)x = HxA = KA = HA and thus x∈NG(HA). Therefore NG(HA)∈Cπ.

Assume now that K is a π-Hall subgroup of [formula]. Then [formula] and [formula]. If x∈G is such that K = Hx, then [formula] and thus [formula]. Therefore [formula].

Let A be a normal, H be a π-Hall subgroup of a group G and [formula] (this condition is satisfied, if [formula]). Then an A-class of π-Hall subgroups is a class of G-induced π-Hall subgroups if and only if it is H-invariant.

If K is a π-Hall subgroup of G, then K  ≤  HACG(A) holds and so KACG(A) = HACG(A). Since the A-class [formula] is K-invariant, it is invariant under HACG(A) = KACG(A) and hence under H.

Now we prove the inverse statement. Without lost of generality we may assume that G = HA. Let U be a π-Hall subgroup of A such that {Ux|x∈A} is H-invariant. Then Frattini argument implies H  ≤  NG(U)A and so G = NG(U)A. Note that

[formula]

is a π-group. Thus NG(U) has a normal series

[formula]

each factor of this series is either a π- or a π'- group. By Lemma [\ref=base](2) NG(U) has the property Dπ. Let K be its π-Hall subgroup. Clearly U  ≤  K. More over K is a π-Hall subgroup of G, since

[formula]

Therefore, [formula] is a G-induced π-Hall subgroup.

Let A be a normal, H be a π-Hall subgroups of a Cπ-group G and [formula]. Then kGπ(A) = kHAπ(A).

Since HA is a normal subgroup of G, each π-Hall subgroup of G is contained in HA. By Lemma [\ref=Norm] HA∈Cπ, and so the equality kGπ(A)  =  kHAπ(A) holds.

Let A be a normal, H be a π-Hall subgroup of a Eπ-group G and [formula]. Then the following statements are equivalent.

(1) kGπ(A) = 1.

(2) HA∈Cπ.

(3) Every two π-Hall subgroups of G are conjugate by an element of A.

(1)  ⇒  (2). If K is a π-Hall subgroup of HA, then by (1) groups [formula] and [formula] are conjugate in A. We may assume that [formula]. Then H and K are contained in [formula]. By Frattini argument we have [formula]. So

[formula]

is a π-group. Thus [formula] has a normal series

[formula]

each factor of this series is either a π- or a π'- group, and, by Lemma [\ref=base](2) has the property Dπ. In particular, H and K are conjugate in [formula].

(2)  ⇒  (3) and (3)  ⇒  (1) are evident.

Let [formula] be a normal and H be a π-Hall subgroups of G. Assume also that subgroups [formula] are normal in G and G = HACG(A). Then [formula].

Two π-Hall subgroups P and Q of A are conjugate in A if and only if π-Hall subgroups [formula] and [formula] of Ai are conjugate in Ai for each [formula]. To prove the lemma it is enough to show that the product of every A1-, [formula], As- classes of G-induced π-Hall subgroups is an A-class of again G-induced π-Hall subgroups. Let [formula] be G-induced π-Hall subgroups of [formula] respectively. We shall show that

[formula]

is a G-induced π-Hall subgroup of A. By Lemma [\ref=ind=inv] it is enough to show that for each h∈H there exists a∈A with Uh = Ua. Since [formula] for a suitable π-Hall subgroup Ki of G, then {Uxii|xi∈Ai} is invariant under Ki and so under KiA = HA. In particular, Uhi = Uaii for some ai∈Ai. Thus

[formula]

where [formula].

Let [formula] be a normal, H be a π-Hall subgroups of G. Assume that G acts transitively by conjugation on the set [formula] and G = HACG(A). Then [formula].

We shall show that if x,y∈G are in the same coset of G by NG(A1), then for each G-induced π-Hall subgroup U1 of A1 subgroups Ux1 and Uy1 are conjugate in Ai = Ax1 = Ay1. It is enough to show that subgroups U1 and Ut1, where t = xy- 1∈NG(A1), are conjugate in A1. Let t = ach, a∈A, c∈CG(A), h∈H. Since subgroups U1 and Uac1 are conjugate in A1, we need to show that U1 and Uh1 are conjugate in A1. Since ac∈NG(A1), then h normalizes also the subgroup A1. Let [formula] for some G-induced π-Hall subgroup U of A. Let [formula] be an A-class, containing U, and let [formula], where [formula] is an Ai-class of G-induced π-Hall subgroups. Clearly [formula]. Since, according to Lemma [\ref=ind=inv], the class [formula] is H-invariant, then H acts on the set [formula]. An element h normalizes A1, so stabilizes the A1-class [formula]. In particular, subgroups U1 and Uh1 are in [formula] and so are conjugate in A1.

Let f∈H and Af1 = Ai. For an A1-class of π-Hall subgroups [formula] define an Ai-class [formula], assuming [formula]. Clearly [formula] is an Ai-class of G-induced π-Hall subgroups.

Let [formula] be a right transversal of H by NH(A1), with h1 = 1. Up to the renumberring we may assume that Ai = Ahi1. Since ACG(A)  ≤  NG(Ai) for every [formula], then elements [formula] forms a right transversal of G by NG(A1). We shall show that the map

[formula]

is a bijection between the set of A1-classes of G-induced π-Hall subgroups and the set of A-classes of G-induced π-Hall subgroups. Since [formula] is H-invariant, then by Lemma [\ref=ind=inv] its elements are G-induced π-Hall subgroups. It is also clear that the map is injective. Let [formula] be an A-class of G-indu-ced π-Hall subgroups. To prove the surjectivity it is enough to show that [formula] for every [formula]. Since G acts transitively on [formula], then there exists an element g∈G such that Ag1 = Ai. Let g = act, where a∈A, c∈CG(A), and t∈H. Then At1 = Ai and t∈NH(A1)hi. As we have proved, [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=ind=inv] the class [formula] is H-invariant, therefore [formula] and [formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=Simple]

Statement (1) of the theorem follows from [\cite=GroConjOddOrder]. Statement (2) of the theorem follows from [\cite=RevVdoDpiFinal] Thus we need to prove statement (3) of the theorem.

Let π be a set of primes such that 2,3∈π. Consider all known simple groups separately.

If [formula], then the statement of the lemma follows from [\cite=RevVdoDpiFinal].

In sporadic groups all proper π-Hall subgroups with 2,3∈π are given in [\cite=RevDpiOneClass] (note that there is an evident missprint in the table, {2,3,7}-Hall subgroup of J1 has the structure 23:7:3). By using [\cite=Atlas], it is easy to see that in all cases [formula].

Let S be a finite group of Lie type over a field of characteristic p∈π and H be a π-Hall subgroup of S. By [\cite=RevHallp] one of the following cases 1-4 holds.

Case 1. H = S. Clearly kπ(S) = 1.

Case 2. H is contained in a Borel subgroup of S. In this case, since Borel subgroups are conjugate and solvable, we have that kπ(S)  =  1.

Case 3. [formula], ε∈{ + , - }, H is a parabolic subgroup with a Levi factor isomorphic to Dεn - 1(2t). Since all such parabolic subgroups are conjugate, kπ(S)  =  1.

Case 4. S≃PSL(V) and H is an image in PSL(V) of a parabolic subgroup of [formula], stabilizing a series of subspaces [formula]. If ni is equal to dim Vi / Vi - 1, and n is equal to dim V, then one of the following subspaces holds

(4.1) n is an odd prime, s = 2, {n1,n2}  =  {1,n - 1}, kπ(S) = 2;

(4.3) n = 4, s = 2, n1 = n2 = 2, kπ(S) = 1;

(4.4) n = 5, s = 2 {n1,n2}  =  {2,3}, kπ(S) = 2;

(4.5) n = 5, s = 3, {n1,n2,n3}  =  {1,2,2}, kπ(S) = 3;

(4.6) n = 7, s = 2, {n1,n2}  =  {3,4}, kπ(S) = 2;

(4.7) n = 8, s = 2, n1 = n2 = 4, kπ(S) = 1;

(4.8) n = 11, s = 2, {n1,n2}  =  {5,6}, kπ(S) = 2.

Assume at last that S is a finite group of Lie type over a field of characteristic p, [formula] and H is a π-Hall subgroup of S.

If S≃Aεn(q), where [formula], ε∈{ + , - }, A+n(q) = An(q) and [formula], then by [\cite=RevVdoDpiFinal] we have kπ(S) = 1. Assume that S≃A1(q). If [formula] and [formula], then by [\cite=RevVdoDpiFinal] we have kπ(S) = 1.

Assume that [formula]. Then by [\cite=RevVdoDpiFinal], either H is contained in the normalizer of a maximal torus (and all such subgroups are conjugate), or H is isomorphic to [formula] or [formula] and H is a homomorphic image of a primitive absolutely irreducible solvable subgroup of [formula]. From [\cite=SupMat]it follows that all such subgroups H are conjugate in PGL2(q), hence in PSL2(q) there exist at most 2 classes of such subgroups. Thus in this case [formula].

Assume now that [formula]. By [\cite=RevVdoDpiFinal] it follows that in this case either H is contained in the normalizer of a maximal torus (and all such subgroups are conjugate), or H is isomorphic to [formula]. More over since [formula], then p does not divide [formula], in particular, [formula]. By [\cite=Atlas] or [\cite=GAP] it follows that [formula], being the preimage of H in [formula], there exist 2 exact irreducible complex representation of degree 2, conjugated by an outer automorphism of [formula], while [formula] has no representations of degree 2. By [\cite=Isaacs] and the fact that [formula], there exist precisely two nonequivalent representations of degree 2 over the field [formula] of [formula], conjugated by an outer automorphism. Therefore, all subgroups H, isomorphic to PSL2(5), are conjugate in PGL2(q), ans so in PSL2(q) there exists at most 2 classes of such subgroups. Thus, in this case [formula].

Let S be a group of Lie type distinct from Aεn(q), H is its π-Hall subgroup, and 2,3∈π, [formula] (in particular, p does not divide |H| and |2.H|). If S is not isomorphic to one of the groups [formula], [formula] or [formula], then by [\cite=RevVdoDpiFinal], H is contained in the normalizer of a maximal torus and all such π-Hall subgroups are conjugate. If S is isomorphic to one of the groups [formula], [formula] or [formula], then by [\cite=RevVdoDpiFinal] either H is solvable and contained in the normalizer of a maximal torus (in this case all such π-Hall subgroups are conjugate and the order of a Sylow 7-subgroup is greater than 72), or [formula] and the pair (S,H) lies in the following list: [formula], [formula], [formula]. Note that if H is nonsolvable, then the order of its Sylow 7-subgroup is not greater than 72, so there does not exists a π-Hall subgroup contained in the normalizer of a maximal torus. By [\cite=KleidO8] the number of conjugacy classes of subgroups of GO7(q), isomorphic to Ω7(2), and subgroups of GO+8(q), isomorphic to 2.Ω+8(2), is not greater than the number of irreducible representation of these subgroups of degrees 7 and 8 respectively. By using ordinary characters tables of Ω7(2) and 2.Ω+8(2), given in [\cite=Atlas] or [\cite=GAP], we obtain that both these groups has precisely one irreducible complex representation of degree 7 or 8 respectively, while 2.Ω7(2) and Ω+8(2) have no complex representations of degrees 7 and 8 respectively. By [\cite=Isaacs], this statement also holds for representations over [formula]. It follows the inequalities [formula] if [formula] and [formula] if [formula]. In the case [formula] the group H is contained in the centralizer of an involution an by [\cite=Ca2] all such centralizers are conjugate, so in this case [formula] also.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=MainTheorem]

Assume that the theorem is not true and G is a counter example of minimal order. Then G contains a π-Hall subgroup H and a normal subgroup A such that HA has no the property Cπ. Choose from such subgroups A the minimal by inclusion. Let K be a π-Hall subgroup of HA, that is not conjugate to H in HA. The process of eliminating of G we divide into several steps.

Clearly

(1) HA = KA.

(2) A is a minimal normal subgroup of G.

Otherwise let M be a nontrivial normal subgroup of G, that is properly contained in A. Let [formula], and for each subgroup B of G by [formula] we denote the group BM / M. By Lemma [\ref=quot] the group [formula] has the property Cπ, [formula] and [formula] are its π-Hall subgroups, [formula] is a normal subgroup, [formula] and [formula]. By the minimality of the counter example, G the group [formula] has the property Cπ. So subgroups [formula] and [formula] are conjugate by an element of [formula]. This means that subgroups HM and KM are conjugate by an element of A. Without lost of generality we may assume that HM = KM. In view of the choice of A, the group HM has the property Cπ. But this means that H and K are conjugate by an element of M  ≤  A, a contradiction.

(3) [formula]. In particular, A is not solvable.

Otherwise by Lemma [\ref=cpiext] HA would have the property Cπ as an extension of a Cπ-group by a π-group.

(4) HA is a normal subgroup of G.

Otherwise NG(HA) is a proper subgroup of G and by Lemma [\ref=Norm] NG(HA)∈Cπ. Since G is a counter example of minimal order, HA∈Cπ, a contradiction.

By (2) and (3)

(5) A is a direct product of simple non-Abelian groups [formula]. The group G acts transitively by conjugation on [formula].

Let [formula] be orbits of HA on the set Ω, and let Tj  =  〈Δj〉 for each [formula]. By (4) and (5)

(6) G acts transitively by conjugation on [formula]. The subgroup A is a direct product of [formula], and each of Ti is normal in HA.

Let S∈Ω and T is the subgroup, generated by the orbit from [formula], that contains S. By Lemmas ���� [\ref=crit] and [\ref=TransAct] it follows that

(7) kGπ(T) = kGπ(S).

By (7) and Lemmas [\ref=crit] and [\ref=TrivAct] it follows

(8) kGπ(A) = (kGπ(T))s = (kGπ(S))s.

Since [formula], from (8) and by Corollary [\ref=SimpleCor] it follows that

(9) kGπ(A) is a π-number.

By Lemma [\ref=ind=inv]

(10) HA leaves invariant each A-class of G-induced π-Hall subgroups.

Since G∈Cπ,

(11) G acts transitively on the set of A-classes of G-induced π-Hall subgroups.

By (10), the subgroup HA is contained in the kernel of this action. Now, by (11)

(12) kGπ(A) is a π'-number.

From (9) and (12) it follows that

(13) kGπ(A) = 1.

Now by Lemma [\ref=crit]

(14) HA∈Cπ, a contradiction.

Thus the theorem is proved.
