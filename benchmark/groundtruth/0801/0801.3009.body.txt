An analogue of the Magnus problem for associative algebras

Let we recall two group-theoretic statements concerning free subgroups in finitely presented groups. The Magnus theorem [\cite=mag1] [\cite=mag2] says that if a group G is given by n + k generators and k relations and has a system of n generators, then G is a free group of rank n. The following theorem was proved by Romanowskii [\cite=rom]: let G be a group given by n + k generators and k relations. Then there exists a free subgroup of G of rank n. Moreover, generators of this free subgroup can be chosen from the initial generators of the group. Analogues of both theorems for semigroups were proved by Shneerson [\cite=shne1]. The second theorem (Lyndon condition) for associative algebras over finite fields was announced in [\cite=shne2] and proved in [\cite=khar]. We present here the proof of the analog of Magnus theorem for associative algebras without unity over arbitrary field.

Let us fix the presentation of A:

[formula]

where [formula]. We assume that the free associative algebra [formula] is supplied by the ordinary degree function, with all variables having degree 1. Denote the linear part (homogeneous part of degree 1) of [formula] by Lg. Let we mention two easy general facts.

Let [formula] be a system of elements [formula] and [formula] obtained from V by a non-degenerate linear transformation. Then algebraic independence of V is equivalent to algebraic independence of W.

Let [formula], [formula] be a system of elements of degree 1. Then V is algebraically independent if and only if V is linearly independent.

Let [formula] be a system of generators of A. For convenience, we denote hj by gn + j. We also denote linear parts of polynomials [formula] as [formula]: Lgj = yj.

The system [formula] is algebraically independent.

According to Corollary [\ref=c1], it suffices to verify that [formula] are linearly independent. Since [formula] generate the quotient [formula], we have that

[formula]

for any [formula]. Comparing the linear parts in these relations, we obtain

[formula]

for any [formula]. Hence the (n + k)-element system [formula] is linearly independent.

Consider the isomorphism φ of free algebras [formula] defined by the formula [formula].

The system [formula] is algebraically independent in the algebra

[formula]

if and only if the system [formula] is algebraically independent in the algebra

[formula]

Since φ is an isomorphism of free associative algebras, the lemma follows.

The system [formula] is algebraically independent in the algebra

[formula]

By the described non-degenerate change of variables, we ensure that:

[formula]

Indeed, since φ(xi) is equal to [formula] and yk are linearly independent, there exists an inverse transformation [formula]. Hence

[formula]

Suppose there exists [formula], Φ  ≠  0 such that

[formula]

The property ([\ref=e3]) allows us to compare the minimal homogeneous parts of [formula] and [formula]. Homogeneous part of minimal degree of the polynomial [formula] is [formula], where [formula] is the homogeneous part of minimal degree of [formula]. Indeed, [formula] because [formula] are algebraically independent. Hence [formula] contains only variables [formula] and does not contain [formula].

Now we shall prove a lemma, which shows that some minimal degree monomials of all non-zero elements of the ideal [formula] contain one of the variables [formula]. This contradiction will show that [formula] and therefore the elements [formula] are algebraically independent.

Let us consider the free associative algebra [formula] with the ordering on the variables [formula]. It induces the degree-lexicographical ordering on the set of monomials 〈X〉: [formula] if k < m or k = m and there exists l such that il < jl and is = js for s < l.

For [formula] by m(s) we denote the minimal monomial (with respect to the above ordering) which appears in s with non-zero coefficient.

Let [formula] and the linear part of fi is xi for any i: Lfi = xi. Let also [formula] be the ideal generated by [formula]. Then for any s∈I, its minimal monomial m(s) contains at least one of the variables [formula].

For an arbitrary presentation

[formula]

where [formula] and pαi,qαi∈〈X〉, we define the parameter τ  =  τ(Π(s)) of the presentation Π(s) as the minimal monomial appearing in the presentation:

[formula]

where uj(fi) are monomials appearing in the polynomial fi. We shall prove that under our conditions for each [formula], there exists a presentation Π(s) of s with the parameter m(s). We start with an arbitrary presentation of s:

[formula]

where [formula] and pαi,qαi are monomials. Consider those elements pαifiqαi of this sum for which pαixiqαi equals to the parameter τ of this presentation. Clearly [formula]. If τ = m(s), we are through. Assume that τ < m(s) and consider

[formula]

Since τ < m(s), we have M = 0. We will obtain a new presentation of s if in Π(s) we replace all xi with [formula] by fi - (fi - xi) in all monomials pαi, qαi from the sum M. Since M = 0, the same sum with xi replaced by fi also equals zero. Moreover, if we eliminate the last sum from the new presentation, we again obtain a presentation of s whose parameter is greater than τ since m(fi - xi) > xi. Hence we have obtained a presentation of s with a greater parameter. If the new parameter is still less that m(s), we can apply the same procedure to get another presentation with greater parameter etc. Since it can not become greater than m(s), the process will terminate and we will obtain a presentation of s with parameter m(s). Since the parameter of any presentation via [formula] contains at least one of the variables [formula], we obtain the statement of the lemma.

As it was already mentioned above, the proof of Lemma [\ref=l1] completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=t3].

Now the Main Theorem follows from Lemma [\ref=t2] and Theorem [\ref=t3].
