A local form for the automorphisms of the spectral unit ball

Background

Let Mn be the set of all n  ×  n complex matrices. For A∈Mn denote by sp(A) the spectrum of A. The spectral ball Ωn is the set

[formula]

Let F be an automorphism of Ωn, that is to say, a biholomorphic map of the spectral ball into itself. Ransford and White [\cite=RW] proved that, by composing with a natural lifting of a Möbius map of the disk, one could reduce oneself to the case where F(0) = 0, and that in that case the linear map F'(0) was a linear automorphism of Ωn, so that by composing with its inverse, one is reduced to the case F(0) = 0, F'(0) = I (the identity map). We then say that the automorphism if normalized. Ransford and White [\cite=RW] proved that such automorphisms preserve the spectrum of matrices.

We say that two matrices X,Y are conjugate if there exists Q∈M- 1n such that X  =  Q- 1YQ.

Baribeau and Ransford [\cite=BRa] (see also [\cite=BRo] for a more elementary proof) proved that every spectrum-preserving C1-diffeomorphism of an open subset of Mn, and thus every normalized automorphism of the spectral ball is a pointwise conjugation:

[formula]

Rostand's contribution [\cite=Ro] was to show that Q(X) could be chosen locally holomorphically in a neighborhood of every X admitting n distinct eigenvalues.

We will give a short proof of a slightly stronger result: the exceptional set of matrices where the local holomorphic choice cannot be guaranteed will be of complex codimension 2 instead of 1.

The motivation for this result was a conjecture formulated in [\cite=RW] about the automorphisms of the spectral ball, which reduces to asking whether any normalized automorphisms can be written in the form [\eqref=conj], where Q would be globally homorphic on Ωn, and depend only on the conjugacy class of X. Notice that a recent result of Zwonek [\cite=Zwo] shows that any proper map of the spectral ball to itself is actually an automorphism of it, so that the proof of the Ransford-White conjecture would yield a description of all the proper maps of the spectral ball into itself.

I wish to thank Nikolai Nikolov, who told me about this circle of ideas. Without the fruitful discussions I had with him on this topic, this paper wouldn't have been written.

Statement

We say that a matrix M is cyclic (or non-derogatory) if there exists a cyclic vector for M, i.e. [formula] such that [formula] spans [formula], which is equivalent to the fact that [formula] is a basis of [formula].

Many equivalent definitions of this notion can be found, for instance in [\cite=HJ] and [\cite=HJTop], or [\cite=NTZ]. We point one out: M is cyclic if and only if for any [formula], [formula]. In particular, any matrix with n distinct eigenvalues is cyclic, and for any given spectrum [formula], the set of non-cyclic matrices with that spectrum is the algebraic set

[formula]

Hence the set of non-cyclic matrices is of codimension 1 in the set of matrices which admit at least one multiple eigenvalue, itself of codimension 1 in Mn.

Let F be a spectrum-preserving holomorphic map of Ωn. Let X0∈Ωn be a cyclic matrix. Then there exists a neighborhood VX0 of X0 and a map Q holomorphic from VX0 to M- 1n such that for any X∈VX0, F(X)  =  Q(X)- 1XQ(X).

Proof

We fix some notation. For A∈Mn, let

[formula]

and [formula] are the (possibly equal) eigenvalues of A. Those are polynomials in the coefficients of A. Put [formula]

Conversely, given [formula], the associated companion matrix Ca is

[formula]

The companion matrix associated to a matrix A is Cσ(A). They have the same characteristic polynomial, or equivalently σ(Cσ(A))  =  σ(A).

Now given a matrix X0 as in the Theorem, and a vector v0 cyclic for X0, let

[formula]

This is a neighborhood of X0. Let Pv0(M) be the matrix with columns [formula]; this depends polynomially on the entries of M, and is invertible. One can see that for X∈UX0,

[formula]

(the n - 1st columns columns coincide, and they have the same characteristic polynomial).

By the Baribeau-Ransford theorem [\cite=BRa] F(X0) is conjugate to X0, therefore cyclic. So there is a neighborhood UF(X0) where the relation Pw0(Y)- 1YPw0(Y)  =  Cσ(Y) holds. Take VX0  ⊂  UX0 small enough so that F(VX0)  ⊂  UF(X0). For any X∈VX0, using the fact that F is spectrum-preserving,

[formula]

so that we have the theorem with Q(X)  =  Pv0(X)Pw0(F(X))- 1. [formula]

Notice that there is no hope to make a global holomorphic choice of v0 on the whole open of cyclic matrices. Indeed, since the complement of this is of codimension 2, we could then extend it to the whole of Ωn by Hartog's phenomenon, but it would mean that all matrices are cyclic, which is obviously false.
