Gravitational collapse in quantum gravity

Introduction

One of the outstanding problems in theoretical physics is the incomplete understanding at the quantum level of the formation, and subsequent evolution of black holes in a quantum theory of gravity. Although a subject of study for over three decades, it is fair to say that, in spite of partial results in string theory and loop quantum gravity, there is no widely accepted answer to many of the puzzles of black hole physics. This is largely because there has been no study of quantum dynamical collapse in these approaches. Rather, progress has focused mainly on explanations of the microscopic origin of the entropy of static black holes from state counting. A four-dimensional spacetime picture of black hole formation from matter collapse, and its subsequent evolution is not available in any approach to quantum gravity at the present time.

This paper summarizes an attempt to address this problem in the context of Hawking's original derivation of black hole radiation: spherically symmetric gravity minimally coupled to a massless scalar field. This is a non-linear 2d field theory describing the coupled system of the metric and scalar field degrees of freedom. Gravitational collapse in the classical theory in this model has been carefully studied numerically [\cite=chop] [\cite=gundrev], but its full quantization has never been addressed.

Hawking's semi-classical calculation [\cite=hawk1] uses the eikonal approximation for the wave equation in a mildly dynamical background, where the dynamics centers on the surface of a star undergoing collapse. The essential content of it is the extraction of the phase of the ingoing mode from an outgoing solution of the scalar wave equation as a classically collapsing star crosses its Schwarzschild radius. According to this calculation, emitted particles appear to originate near the event horizon. This means that an emitted particle observed by a geodesic observer is transplankian at creation origin due to the gravitational redshift (which is infinite at the horizon). Its back reaction is therefore not negligible, bringing into question the entire approximation.

It is likely that a complete understanding of quantum evolution in this system will resolve all the outstanding problems of black hole physics in the setting in which they originally arose. The following sections contain a summary of the work described in refs. [\cite=hw1] [\cite=hw2] [\cite=hw3] [\cite=hw4].

Classical theory

The phase space of the model is defined by prescribing a form of the gravitational phase space variables qab and ab, together with falloff conditions in r for these variables, and for the lapse and shift functions N and Na, such that the ADM 3+1 action for general relativity minimally coupled to a massless scalar field

[formula]

is well defined. The constraints arising from varying the lapse and shift are

[formula]

where abqab and R is the Ricci scalar of qab. The falloff conditions imposed on the phase space variables are motivated by the Schwarzschild solution in Painleve-Gullstand (PG) coordinates, which itself is to be a solution in the prescribed class of spacetimes. These conditions give the following falloff for the gravitational phase space variables (for ε > 0)

[formula]

where fab,gab,hab are symmetric tensors, [formula], and q =  detqab.

In this general setting we use the parametrization

[formula]

for the 3-metric and conjugate momentum for a reduction to spherical symmetry, where eab is the flat 3-metric and na  =  xa / r. Substituting these into the 3+1 ADM action for general relativity shows that the pairs (R,PR) and (Λ,PΛ) are canonically conjugate variables. We note for example the Poisson bracket

[formula]

which is the bracket represented in the quantum theory (described below).

The falloff conditions induced on these variables from ([\ref=pgfo]), together with those on the lapse and shift functions, ensure that the reduced action

[formula]

is well defined. This completes the definition of the classical theory.

At this stage we perform a time gauge fixing using the condition Λ = 1 motivated by PG coordinates. This is second class with the Hamiltonian constraint, which therefore must be imposed strongly and solved for the conjugate momentum PΛ. This gauge fixing eliminates the dynamical pair (Λ,PΛ), fixes the lapse as a function of the shift, and leads to a system describing the dynamics of the variables (R,PR) and (φ,Pφ) [\cite=hw2]. The reduced radial diffeomorphism generator

[formula]

remains as the only first class constraint. It also gives the gauge fixed Einstein evolution equations via Poisson brackets, for example [formula].

Quantum gravity

The quantization route we follow is unconventional in that field momenta are not represented as self-adjoint operators; rather only exponentials of momenta are realized on the Hilbert space. This is similar to what happens in a lattice quantization, except that, as we see below, every quantum state represents a lattice sampling of field excitations, with all lattices allowed. This quantization allows definitions of bounded inverse configurations operators such as 1 / x, which for quantum gravity leads to the mechanism for curvature singularity resolution described below.

A quantum field is characterized by its excitations at a given set of points in space. The important difference from standard quantum field theory is that in the representation we use, such states are normalizable. A basis state is

[formula]

where the factors of L in the exponents reflect the length dimensions of the respective field variables, and ak,bl are real numbers which represent the excitations of the scalar quantum fields R and φ at the radial locations {xk} and {yl}. The inner product on this basis is

[formula]

if the states contain the same number of sampled points, and is zero otherwise.

The action of the basic operators are given by

[formula]

where aj is 0 if the point xj is not part of the original basis state. In this case the action creates a new excitation at the point xj with value -  λj. These definitions give the commutator

[formula]

Comparing this with ([\ref=bpb]), and using the Poisson bracket commutator correspondence { , }  ↔  i[ , ] gives [formula], where lP is the Planck length. There are similar operator definitions for the canonical pair (φ,Pφ).

Singularity resolution

To address the singularity avoidance issue, we first extend the manifold on which the fields R etc. live to include the point r = 0 , which in the gauge fixed theory is the classical singularity. We then ask what classical phase space observables capture curvature information. For homogeneous cosmological models, a natural choice is the inverse scale factor a(t). For the present case, a guide is provided by the gauge fixed theory without matter where it is evident that it is the extrinsic curvature that diverges at r = 0, which is the Schwarzschild singularity. This suggests, in analogy with the inverse scale factor, that we consider the field variable 1 / R as a measure of curvature. A more natural choice would be a scalar constructed from the phase space variables by contraction of tensors. A simple possibility is

[formula]

The small r behaviour of the phase space variables ensures that any divergence in [formula] is due to the 1 / R factor. We therefore focus on this. A first observation is that the configuration variables R(r,t) and φ(r,t) defined at a single point do not have well defined operator realizations. Therefore we are forced to consider phase space functions integrated over (at least a part of) space. A functional such as

[formula]

for a test function f provides a measure of sphere size in our parametrization of the metric. We are interested in the reciprocal of this for a measure of curvature. Since R  ~  r asymptotically, the functions f must have the falloff f(r)  ~  r- 2 - ε for Rf to be well defined. Using this, it is straightforward to see that 1 / Rf diverges classically for small spheres: we can choose f > 0 of the form f  ~  1 for r <  < 1, which for large r falls asymptotically to zero. Then Rf  ~  r2 and 1 / Rf diverges classically for small spheres.

A question for the quantum theory is whether 1 / Rf can be represented densely on a Hilbert space as 1 / R̂f. This is possible only if the chosen representation is such that R̂f does not have a zero eigenvalue. If it does, we must represent 1 / Rf as an operator more indirectly, using another classically equivalent function. Examples of such functions are provided by Poisson bracket identities such as

[formula]

where the functions f do not have zeroes. The representation for the quantum theory described above is such that the operator corresponding to Rf has a zero eigenvalue. Therefore we represent 1 / Rf using the r.h.s. of ([\ref=invRf]). The central question for singularity resolution is whether the corresponding operator is densely defined and bounded. This turns out to be the case.

Using the expressions for the basic field operators, we can construct an operator corresponding to a classical singularity indicator:

[formula]

The result is that basis states are eigenvectors of this operator, and all eigenvalues are bounded. This is illustrated with the state

[formula]

which represents an excitation a0 of the quantum field R̂f at the point of the classical singularity:

[formula]

which is clearly bounded. This shows that the singularity is resolved at the quantum level. In particular if there is no excitation of Rf at the classical singularity, ie. a0 = 0, the upper bound on the eigenvalue of the inverse operator is 2 / l2P.

Quantum black holes

The event horizon of a static or stationary black hole is a global spacetime concept. It does not provide a useful local determination of whether one is inside a black hole. The fundamental idea for defining a black hole locally is that of a trapped surface, first introduced by Penrose. One considers a closed spacelike 2-surface in a spacetime, and computes the expansions θ+ and θ- of outgoing and ingoing null geodesics emanating orthogonally from the surface. If θ+ > 0 and θ- < 0, the surface is considered normal. On the other hand if θ+  ≤  0 and θ- < 0, the surface is called trapped. This provides a criterion for subdividing a spacetime into trapped and normal regions. The outer boundary of a trapped region may be considered as the (dynamical) boundary of black hole, also known as the "apparent horizon" in numerical relativity. It is a function computed in classical numerical evolutions to test for black hole formation. Similarly, a setting for studying quantum collapse requires an operator realisation of the null expansion "observable," and a criterion to see if a given quantum state describes a "quantum black hole."

The classical expansions in spherical symmetry are the phase space functions [\cite=hw3]

[formula]

Given phase space functions on a spatial hypersurface Σ, the marginal trapping horizon(s) are located by finding the solution coordinates r = ri ([formula]) of the conditions θ+ = 0 and θ- < 0, (since in general there may be more than one solution). The corresponding radii Ri  =  R(ri) are then computed. The size of the horizon on the slice Σ is the largest value in the set {Ri}.

Since only translation operators are available in our quantization, we define PΛ indirectly by

[formula]

where 0 < λ  ≪  1 is an arbitrary but fixed parameter, and Uλ denotes exp(iλPΛ / L). This is motivated by the corresponding classical expression, where the limit λ  →  0 exists, and gives the classical function PΛ. λ is perhaps best understood as a ratio of two scales, λ  =  lp / l0, where l0 is a system size. As for a lattice quantisation, it is evident that momentum in this quantisation can be given approximate meaning only for λ  ≪  1. λ is also the minimum value by which an excitation can be changed.

Definitions for the operators corresponding to R' and Λ' are obtained by implementing the idea of finite differencing. We use narrow Gaussian smearing functions with variance proportional to the Planck scale, peaked at coordinate points rk  +  εlP, where 0 < ε  ≪  1 is a parameter designed to sample neighbouring points:

[formula]

Denoting Rfε by Rε for this class of test functions we define

[formula]

Putting all these pieces together, we can construct the desired operators

[formula]

which have a well defined action on the basis states.

In analogy with the classical case, we propose that a state |Ψ〉 represents a quantum black hole if

[formula]

for some rk. The corresponding horizon size is given by RH  =  〈Ψ|R̂(rk)|Ψ〉.

This definition is utilised as follows: Given a state with field excitations at a set of coordinate points {ri}, one would plot the expectation values in Eqn. ([\ref=qbh]) as functions of 〈Ψ|R̂(rk)|Ψ〉, and locate the zeroes, if any, of the resulting graph. The resulting "quantum horizon" location is invariant under radial diffeomorphisms because these act on states to shift the coordinate locations of field excitations, but leave the expectation values unchanged - the graph is a physical observable.

It is straightforward to construct explicit examples of states satisfying these quantum trapping conditions. Some examples appear in [\cite=hw3]. The quantum horizons so determined are not sharp since 〈θ2+〉  ≠  0.

Summary and outlook

The results so far from this approach to understanding black hole formation in quantum gravity are threefold: (i) A quantization procedure which allows explicit calculations to be done, (ii) a test for black holes in a full quantum gravity setting which makes no use classical boundary conditions at event horizons, and (iii) singularity free and unitary evolution equations using the Hamiltonian defined in [\cite=hw4].

The main computational challenge is to use the formalism to explicitly compute the evolution of a given matter-geometry state until it satisfies the quantum black hole criteria, and then to continue to the evolution to see if and how Hawking radiation might arise. This work is in progress.
