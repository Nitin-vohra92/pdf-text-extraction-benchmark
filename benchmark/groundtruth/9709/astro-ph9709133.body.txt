OG 8.2 SECONDARY ACCELERATION OF COSMIC RAYS BY SUPERNOVA SHOCKS A. Wandel1 1 Racah Inst. of Physics, The Hebrew University, Jerusalem 91904, Israel ABSTRACT In the common model supernova shock-acceleration of cosmic rays there are two open questions: 1. where does the high energy cosmic rays below the knee (104 - 106 Gev) come from, and 2. are cosmic ray accelerated only at their origin or contineuosly during their residence in the Galaxy. We show that 1015 eV light nuclei are probably accelerted by associations of supernovae. The ratio of the spectra of secondary to primary cosmic rays would be affected by repeated (or secondary) acceleration in the ISM during their propagation in the galaxy. The observed secondary and primary CR spectra are used to constrain the amount of such secondary acceleration  by supernova remnants (SNR). Two cases are considered: weak shocks (1 < M < 2) of old, dispersed remnants, and strong shocks (M > 3) of relatively young remnants. It is shown that weak shocks produce more secondary acceleration  than what is permitted in the framework of the standard leaky box (SLB) model, making it inconsistent with dispersed acceleration that should be produced by SNR. If the SLB is modified to allow a moderate amount of RA by week shocks, the RA produced by old SNRs agrees with the rate reqired to fit the secondary-to primaray cosmic-ray data, making a self consistent picture. Significant secondary acceleration  by strong shocks of young SNRs should lead to flattening of the secondary-to primaray ratio at high energies, near 1TeV/nucleon.

WHAT IS SECONDARY ACCELERATION? The cosmic ray  spectrum in the range 1-105 is probably produced by shock acceleration in the Galaxy (e.g. Axford 1981). Its power-law shape J(p)  ~  p2.7 is beleived to be produced by strong shocks, probably of young SNR (Blandford and Ostriker, 1980), combined with escape from the Galaxy. After the cosmic ray  particle has left the SNR site and is propagating in the Galaxy, it may enconter another SNR, be trapped and be accelerated to a higher energy. However, the probability to encounter a SNR is proportional to its volume. It turns out to be significant only for old SNR, hens with weak shocks. Indeed, Observations of the ratio of primary to seconday cosmic rays  suggest such a secondary acceleration  process, but at the same time constrain its amount (Eichler 1980, Cowsick 1986). Wande et.al. (1987) have calculated the cosmic ray  spectrum and the constraints on secondary acceleration  set by the data under various secondary acceleration  models, with the secondary acceleration  amount and the shock-strength as parameters. Applying these models to RA by SNR (Wandel 1987;1988) shows that one cannot avoid secondary acceleration  if one assumes that the primary cosmic rays  are produced by supernovae: the young SNR producing the the cosmic rays  will expand and occupy a large enough fraction of the Galaxy to contribute a considerable amount of secondary acceleration  . The standard leaky-box model has therefore to be modified to include RA by SNR.

BEYOND THE KNEE Acceleration by supernova shocks can produce cosmic rays  with energy up to 1015 eV. It is difficult to reach higher energies, because when the gyroradius of the accelerated particles becomes of the order of the shock size, the shock-acceleration mechanism cannot function, as the particle escapes. The gyroradius is given by

[formula]

so that the maximal energy is

[formula]

where E15 is the maximal energy in units of 1015 eV. To reach energies beyond 1015 eV, larger shocks are required, and those can be obtained by going to older SNR and to associations of supernovae. Older SNR have weaker shockes, which produce a steaper power law. Indeed, a significant steepening is observed in the cosmic ray  spectrum beyond 1015. This could indicate that old SNR associate to produce shocked volumes of sizes of 100pc and more. With galactic magnetic fields of 3μG 100pc shocks, if abundant enough, could produce the observed cosmic ray  spectrum up to 3 1016eV for protons and up to 1018eV for iron. The formalism presented by Wandel (1988) is used to convolve the size of the SNR with teir age and shock strength, to determine the probability and rate of secondary acceleration , and the efffective slope of the produced cosmic ray  spectrum.

THE SECONDARY ACCELERATION MODEL

The steady state distribution of a particle population subject to contineous acceleration during its propagation is described by the integral equation

[formula]

where Jo is the source distribution,R = R0(p / po)-  α and S are loss terms due to escape from the galaxy and spallation, B is the rate of encountering accelerating events and

[formula]

is the index of the power law (J  ~  p- q) produced by the shock of Mach number M (q=2 for strong shocks, and larger for weaker shoks). The distribution of each secondary species satisfies a similar equation, with the source term replaced by the sum over all primary species Ji which contribute to the secondary in question, Js(p) = ΣSisJi(p), with Sis is the spallation rate from i to s, and Ji satisfies equation (3).

SECONDARY ACCELERATION AND THE LEAKY BOX MODEL

In the framework of the Standard Leaky Box (SLB) model no secondary acceleration  is allowed, except the margin due to the observational uncertainties. If the SLB model is modified by allowing a modest amount of secondary acceleration  (and assuming a larger escape rate, which compensates for the increase in the secondary to primary  ratio caused by secondary acceleration  ), the constraint on secondary acceleration  is less stringent. Wandel et.al. (1987) have calculated the secondary to primary  (boron/carbon, denoted by B/C) energy spectrum for a modified leaky box models (MLB) with various escape laws, secondary acceleration  rates and shock indices q. Their best fit of the B/C data permits a significantly larger secondary acceleration  rate than in the SLB model. For shocks with q = 4 ~  ~ (M = 1.7)

[formula]

where B and R0 are measured in units of inverse path length [formula].

Similar constraints can be derived from the primary spectra of protons and alpha particles (e.g. Webber, Golden and Stephens 1987).

ACCELERATION BY SUPERNOVA REMNANTS

Weak shocks

The number of supernova remnants  encountered by a cosmic ray  particle during its residence time in the galactic disk, (τcr  ~  107yr at a few GeV/nucleon) is given by [formula] where S is the supernova  rate (per unit volume) in the galaxy, and C = rcr(t) / r represents the cosmic ray  propagation during the remnant's lifetime. The average cosmic ray  residence time in the galactic disk can be written in the form [formula] The reacceleration rate due to supernova remnants  becomes

[formula]

where u = dr / dt = 100u2km / s is the shock velocity, the shock index q is related to the Mach number M = u / cs by q(M) and S12 = S / 10- 12 pc[formula] (one supernova  every 30 years corresponds to S12 = 0.5). We take the sound speed in the ISM cs = 150km / s, so M = 1.7(q = 4) corresponds to u = 250km / s. If the effective density seen by supernova remnants  is that of the warm component of the ISM, neff = 0.1 (McKee and Ostriker 1977), then rq  ~  23pc, Cq  ~  0.2 - 0.4 (depending on the cosmic ray  propagation, Wandel 1988), and eq. (6) gives B = 0.2 - 0.4. While this figure is by a factor 10 larger than the constraint in the SLB model, it is just the secondary acceleration  rate required by the modified model in order to fit the B/C data.

Strong-Shock Secondary Acceleration by Young SNRs

The effect of secondary acceleration  by young SNRs on the secondary to primary  ratio has been considered in previous papers (Wandel 1990; 1991). Although the probability of encountering a young SNR is small, its effect on the cosmic ray  distribution at high energies is strong, and may be detected. At high energies the solutions for the cosmic ray  distribution (eq. 3) become assymptotically power laws, with the power index depending on the source acceleration index q0, the secondary acceleration  index q, and the escape law [formula]. It can be shown that the secondary to primary  ratio has the assymptotic form (Wandel et.al. 1987)

[formula]

In particular, for q = q0 the secondary to primary  ratio should flatten at high energies. The energy at which this flattening occurs depends on the secondary acceleration  rate B and on the secondary acceleration  index q. From the observed cosmic ray  spectra we have q0  +  α  ~  2.7 and α  ~  0.5 - 0.6. A significant flattening of the B/C ratio requires shocks with q  ≤  2.4, which gives M > 4 and u = 600km / s. Young supernova remnants  may evaporate the cold phase of the ISM (McKee and Ostriker 1977), in which case neff = 1. If this is not the case, only the warm component is swept by the shock, so neff = 0.1. Finally, If the supernova  expands within a cavity of hot ISM, neff = 0.003 - 0.01. Eq. (6) gives

[formula]

If the transition between evaporative and non-evaporative expansion happens at an intermediate velocity (Cowie, McKee and Ostriker 1981), B will be between 0.003 and 0.03. The secondary to primary  (Boron/Carbon) ratio has been observed up to ~  1 TeV by the Spacelab-2 experiment of the University of Chicago (Meyer et.al. 1987). The poor statistics at the high energy end prevent a decisive conclusion. However, preliminary data suggest that the B/C ratio in the 0.1-1TeV range is approximately 0.1. Comparing this with the theoretical calculation we find that such a B/C ratio requires a secondary acceleration  rate B(q = 2 - 3)  ~  0.03 - 0.1, so strong-shock secondary acceleration  is probably important, and young supernova remnants  see a relatively low effective density. Even if the B/C ratio beyond 100GeV/n is eventually found to decrease, strong shock secondary acceleration  by evaporative young supernova remnants  places a lower limit on the secondary acceleration  rate at B = 0.003, which would predict a flattening near 1TeV.
