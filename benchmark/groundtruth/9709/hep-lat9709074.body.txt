INTRODUCTION

A relevant quantity to understand the breaking of the UA(1) symmetry in QCD is the topological susceptibility χ in pure Yang-Mills theory [\cite=witten] [\cite=veneziano]

[formula]

where

[formula]

is the topological charge density.

The prediction is [\cite=witten] [\cite=veneziano]

[formula]

where Nf is the relevant number of flavours. Eq. ([\ref=180]) implies a well defined prescription [\cite=witten] [\cite=veneziano] to deal with the x  →  0 singularity in eq. ([\ref=qchi1]).

In [\cite=noi] χ was evaluated at zero and finite temperature for SU(3) Yang-Mills theory. The value obtained at zero temperature was in agreement with the prediction of Eq. ([\ref=180]). The value of χ at finite temperature displayed a sharp drop beyond the deconfinement transition. Here we give a short review of a similar calculation for the SU(2) gauge group [\cite=noi2]. In addition we discuss the comparison with the geometric method, and we show that, after a proper renormalization of the latter, the two procedures give consistent results [\cite=noi3].

RENORMALIZATIONS

Let QL(x) be any definition of the topological charge density on the lattice. The lattice topological susceptibility χL is defined as

[formula]

The lattice regulated QL(x) is related to the continuum [formula] Q(x) by a finite renormalization [\cite=haris]

[formula]

where [formula] in the usual notation.

Since χL does not obey in general the prescription [\cite=witten] [\cite=veneziano] leading to eq. ([\ref=180]), besides the multiplicative renormalization of eq. ([\ref=Z]) there is also an additive renormalization

[formula]

where M(β) contains mixings with operators of dimension ≤  4.

In order to extract the physical signal χ from eq. ([\ref=M]), we need a determination of the renormalization constants M and Z. We will determine them using the non-perturbative method of ref. [\cite=vicari] [\cite=gunduc] [\cite=noi].

THE MONTE CARLO SIMULATION

We have used Wilson action and the usual heat-bath updating algorithm. The scale a(β) was fixed by using the results of ref. [\cite=a] [\cite=b].

Zero Temperature

The simulation was done on a 164 lattice.

We have used various definitions for QL. The i-smeared field theoretical Q(i)L(x) is defined as

[formula]

Π(i)μν is the plaquette in the μ  -  ν plane constructed with i-times smeared links U(i)μ(x) [\cite=smear]. We call M(i) and Z(i) the additive and multiplicative renormalization constants for the i-smeared operators. Of course χ must be independent of the choice of the operator QL.

This is visible in Figure 1, for χ at zero temperature. Up and down-triangles indicate the value of χ as obtained from the 0-smear and 2-smear data respectively. There is good scaling and (χ)1 / 4 = (198  ±  2  ±  6) MeV, the first error is statistical and the second comes from the error in ΛL [\cite=a] [\cite=b].

In Fig. 1 we also report the geometric susceptibility χgL [\cite=geom1] [\cite=geom2]. The usual determination is done by identifying χgL  =  χa4, and claiming that the geometrical susceptibility has no additive renormalization. χgL is shown in Figure 1 by the stars: it is one order of magnitude bigger than the field theoretical determinations and no scaling is observed. By using the same method as for the field theoretical determination, we have measured the multiplicative renormalization Zg, finding Zg  =  1 within errors. At the same time we have determined and subtracted the additive renormalization Mg. This brings down the resulting χ by a factor of 10. The results are shown by the circles in Figure 1 and are in agreement with the field theoretical results. By renormalizing we have eliminated the so-called dislocations.

To support the necessity of the subtraction of Mg, we have also computed the correlation function

[formula]

By reflection positivity we expect that GL(x)  ≤  0 at x  ≠  0. Since 〈Q2L〉  >  0, the susceptibility is mainly determined by the singularity at x  =  0. This correlator, for x lying along a coordinate axis, is shown in Figures 2 for the smeared charges and in Figure 3 for the geometrical charge. The peak at x  =  0 for the geometric charge is 4 - 5 orders of magnitude larger than for the i-smeared charges, indicating that Mg is much bigger than Mi,i  =  0,1,2, and is ~  80% of the observed χL.

Finite Temperature

The simulation was done on a 323  ×  8 lattice. At this size the deconfining transition is located at βc = 2.5115(40) [\cite=b] which means that Tc = 1 / (Nta(βc)) with Nt the temporal size of the lattice.

The data show again a drop at the transition. However this is less sharp than for the SU(3) case [\cite=noi] [\cite=noi2]. In Figure 4 we show the behaviours for SU(2) and SU(3) of the ratio χ(T) / χ(T = 0), where χ(T) indicates the physical susceptibility at temperature T. The slope for the SU(3) data is steeper. In both cases the data at T  <  Tc show a constant value consistent with the value at T = 0.
