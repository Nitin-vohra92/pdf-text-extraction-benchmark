Matrix elements of four-fermion operators in the HQET.

Introduction and Motivation.

B-hadron decays are a very important source of information on the physics of the standard model (SM) and beyond. In many important cases, long distance strong contributions to these processes can be separated into matrix elements of local operators. Lattice QCD can then be used to compute these non-perturbative parameters from first principles. A list of some four-fermion operators relevant to B-meson phenomenology is the following:

the operator OLL  =    γμ  (1 - γ5)  q    γμ  (1 - γ5)  q ( q denotes a light quark u, d or s), which determines the theoretical prediction of the B0-0 mixing in the SM, together with OSLL(RR)  =    (1  ∓  γ5)  q    (1  ∓  γ5)  q, ORR and OSLR, with obvious notation, parametrize SUSY effects in ΔB = 2 transitions [\cite=susy]. Furthermore, OLL and OSLL determine the Bs width difference ΔΓBs [\cite=deltabs];

QLL  =    γμ  (1 - γ5)  q    γμ  (1 - γ5)  b, together with QSLR, parametrize spectator effects in the τB and τBs lifetimes [\cite=taubbs];

finally, the corresponding operators with a ta (the generator of the SU(3) group) insertion: OtLL, OtSLL and OtSLR contribute to SUSY effects in ΔB = 2 transitions [\cite=susy], and QtLL and QtSLR to spectator effects in the B-meson lifetimes [\cite=taubbs].

Our aim is to non-perturbatively evaluate the matrix elements between B-meson states of all the operators relevant to phenomenology using lattice simulations of the HQET for the b-quark. The procedure to perform the transition from QCD to lattice HQET, a combination of analytic and numerical calculations, consists in the four steps described in detail below.

First step: the continuum QCD - HQET matching.

The starting point is to express the QCD operators as linear combinations of the HQET ones in the continuum at a given scale, say, μ = mb. To do so, some amplitudes of the relevant operators between appropriate external B-meson states are evaluated to one-loop order both in QCD and HQET. Once the amplitudes have been renormalized using the same scheme in both theories, the QCD amplitud is expanded in powers of 1 / mb to lowest order. Finally, the coefficients of the matching can be obtain by subtraction at the scale μ. It should be stressed that the matching is renormalization scheme dependent. Notice also that new effective operators can be generated.

For OLL, the matching was determined by Flynn et al using NDR [\cite=flynn] and by Gimenez [\cite=mio2] using DRED. Now, we have extended the calculation to all the relevant operators in section 1. As we said before, new effective operators arise at one-loop order; i.e. the operator OSLL is expressed as a linear combination of two HQET operators ÔSLL and ÔLL. We refer the reader to ref.[\cite=prep1] for details.

Second step: running down to μ = a- 1 in the HQET.

The HQET operators obtained in step 1 at the high scale μ = mb are evolved down to a lower scale μ = a- 1, appropriate for lattice simulations, using the HQET renormalization group equations. The running is governed by the corresponding anomalous dimension matrices. At NLO, one has to calculate both the one- and two-loop anomalous dimension matrices of the relevant effective operators. The former are renormalization scheme independent but the latter are not. The scheme dependence of the two-loop anomalous dimension matrices cancels with the scheme dependence of the matching in step 1.

The calculation of the one-loop anomalous dimension matrix is not difficult

in the basis {ÔLL, ÔSLL, ÔLR, ÔSRL}.

However, only the two-loop anomalous dimension of the operator ÔLL is known. It was determined by Gimenez [\cite=mio2] (see also ref.[\cite=nlo]) using NDR and DRED. Now we have extended the calculation to all effective operators in the basis. Technically this is a very hard task because it involves the evaluation of 49 two-loop Feynman diagrams in the HQET. Moreover, the operators mix among them, see eq.([\ref=eq:dim0]), and with evanescent operators under renormalization. However, some useful relations between the matrix elements of the anomalous dimension matrix can be obtained and used as a check of the calculation using a renormalization prescription preserving Fierz symmetry. We skip all details and refer the reader to ref.[\cite=prep1].

Third step: continuum-lattice HQET matching.

Having obtained the continuum HQET operators at the scale μ = a- 1, they are expressed as a linear combination of lattice HQET operators at this scale. The procedure is very similar to step 1: one matches two amplitudes at one-loop order, one in the continuum HQET and the other in the lattice HQET. However, some subtle points to remember are the following:

the matching has to be calculated using the same action used in the numerical simulation; the matching coefficients depend on the action used in the simulation.

Due to the breaking of chiral symmetry induced by the Wilson term for light quarks, the original operators can mix with new lattice operators.

The matching, as in step 1, depends on the renormalization procedure used to define the operators in the continuum HQET, which cancels with the remaining scheme dependence of the running in step 2.

The lattice counterpart of the operator ÔLL is already known. It was determined by Flynn et al [\cite=flynn] for the Wilson action and by Borrelli and Pittori [\cite=bp] for the SW-Clover action. Again, we have extended the calculation to all the HQET operators in the basis of eq.([\ref=eq:dim0]). Our results for ÔLL agree with ref.[\cite=flynn] but disagree with ref.[\cite=bp] in the sign of the contribution proportional to OlattN (see below) of the group of Feynman diagrams with radiative corrections between light quark legs only. We refer the reader to ref.[\cite=prep2] for details.

As we said before, new lattice operators arise

[formula]

We found that OlattLL mixes with OlattRR and OlattN, OlattLR with Olatt  SRL and OlattM, Olatt  SLL with OlattLL, OlattRR and OlattP and finally Olatt  SLR mixes with OlattRL and OlattQ. We refer the reader to ref.[\cite=prep2] for details.

Fourth step: lattice computation of the matrix elements.

In order to obtain the B-parameters of the relevant operators, we simulate on the lattice the ratio (see, for example, ref.[\cite=gm])

[formula]

where COi(t1,t2) is the three-point correlation function with an insertion of the lattice operator Oi and C(t) is the two-point correlation function for the B-meson. To extract the B-parameter, we search for a plateau in t1 at fixed (and large) t2. We observe, see figs.1 and 2, good plateaux over large time-distances for all operators. This makes us confident that the lightest meson state has been isolated. Furthermore, our results are almost independent of the light quark mass, therefore they can be safely extrapolated to the chiral limit. From figs.1 and 2, we see that the correction given by the subleading operators may be important and cannot be neglected. Using the results from steps 1 to 4, we can evaluate the B-parameters of all operators relevant to phenomenology. For example, for the renormalization scale independent B-parameter of OLL we found B̂Bd  =  1.14  ±  0.16 and B̂Bs  /  B̂Bd  =  1.01  ±  0.01, [\cite=gm]. The calculation of the other B-parameters is in progress and will be published elsewhere [\cite=prep2].
