The axion [\cite=Peccei] [\cite=Wilczek] [\cite=Kim] [\cite=DFS] is the most natural solution to the strong CP problem in QCD [\cite=tHoot]. The axion is associated with breaking of the Peccei-Quinn symmetry whose breaking scale Fa is stringently constrained by laboratory experiments, astrophysics and cosmology; the allowed range of Fa is between 1010 GeV and 1012 GeV [\cite=Kolb-Turner] in the standard cosmology. The lower limit comes from consideration of the cooling of the supernova SN1987A by axions and the upperbound is obtained by requiring the the cosmic axion density should not exceed the critical density of the universe. Thus the axion is one of attractive candidates for dark matter if Fa takes higher values in the allowed region.

However, in the standard cosmology the axion has a domain-wall problem [\cite=Sikivie]. Since the potential of the axion which is formed through QCD instanton effects has N discrete minima ( N: color anomaly factor), domain walls are produced at the QCD scale. The domain walls with N  >  1 form very complicated network together with axionic strings which are produced associated with spontaneous breaking of Peccei-Quinn symmetry and do not disappear in the subsequent evolution of the universe, which leads to a cosmological disaster.

In the inflationary universe [\cite=Guth] [\cite=Sato] it is generally expected that the domain wall problem is solved since the exponential expansion during inflation makes the phase of Peccei-Quinn scalar (=axion) homogeneous beyond the present horizon of the universe and hence axions settle down to the same minimum of the potential in the entire universe. However, in the chaotic inflationary universe [\cite=Linde1] the domain walls are produced through large quantum fluctuations of axions generated in the chaotic inflation [\cite=Lyth1]. The quantum fluctuations of axions δa are given by H / (2π) where H is the Hubble constant during inflation. δa is 1012 - 13GeV for chaotic inflation and it is larger than the Peccei-Quinn scale Fa. This means that the axion phases [formula] become random after inflation and domain walls are produced in the same way as the standard cosmology.

Furthermore, the quantum fluctuations of axions cause anisotropies of the CMB [\cite=Turner] [\cite=Lyth2] [\cite=Linde2] which are too large. Since the axion is massless during inflation, the axion fluctuations do not contribute to the fluctuations of the total energy density of the universe, i.e. isocurvature fluctuations. After the axion acquires a mass ma at the QCD scale, the axion fluctuations become density fluctuations given by δρa  /  ρa  ~  δθa  /  θa, which cause CMB temperature fluctuations δT / T  ~  δθa  /  θa. Since δθa  ~  O(1), the CMB anisotropies produced are O(1), which contradicts observations [\cite=COBE].

It was pointed out in ref.[\cite=Linde2] [\cite=LiLy] that the above two problems are simultaneously solved if the potential of the Peccei-Quinn scalar is very flat. For a flat potential the Peccei-Quinn scalar Φa can have a large expectation value ~  Mpl at the epoch of inflation. Then we should take 〈Φa〉 as the effective Peccei-Quinn scale "Fa" instead of Fa, and the phase fluctuations are suppressed. Therefore, the production of domain walls is suppressed and isocurvature fluctuations decrease. However, in the previous work [\cite=KKY] we showed that the Peccei-Quinn scalar field oscillates after inflation and violently decays into axions through parametric resonance [\cite=KLS], which results in large phase fluctuations of O(1) and hence formation of domain walls.

Recently, the detailed numerical calculations on the formation of topological defects through parametric resonance [\cite=KK] were made and it was found that the critical breaking scale below which the topological defects are formed is ~  1015GeV. Thus, the domain walls are produced for the standard Peccei-Quinn scale (~  1012GeV), and only the axion models with N = 1 are allowed as is pointed in ref. [\cite=KKY]. However, if we take the Peccei-Quinn scale larger than ~  1015GeV, we can avoid the domain wall problem for general axion models with N > 1. Therefore, in this letter, we investigate the axion domain wall problem for [formula]GeV. We show that the domain wall and isocurvature problems are indeed solved for axions with Fa  ~  1015GeV. It is also shown that such axions produce significant amount of isocurvature fluctuations and anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) which can be detected by future satellite experiments.

First let us consider the evolution of the Peccei-Quinn scalar Φa which has a flat potential given by

[formula]

where φa is the radial part of Φa, defined as

[formula]

We also assume an inflaton field χ with a potential:

[formula]

where the coupling constant λ is about 10- 13 which is required to produce the anisotropies of CMBR observed by COBE [\cite=COBE]. In the chaotic condition of the early universe both φa and χ have large expectation values greater than the Planck scale. During inflationary epoch both fields slowly roll down with relation given by

[formula]

The inflationary epoch ends when χ≃Mp / 3 (Mp: Planck mass) and χ and φa begin to oscillate. The potential energy of the Peccei-Quinn scalar φa at this epoch is much larger than the height of the potential hill (= gF4a / 4). Thus φa oscillates beyond the potential hill. Since the potential of φa has minima at φa  =    ±  Fa, φa settles down to Fa or - Fa. If the initial fluctuations of φa are large, the final values of φa are different at different places in the universe, which results in the formation of domain walls. In the present case, the fluctuations of φa comes from quantum fluctuations during inflation and their amplitude is given by

[formula]

where we take χ≃4Mp because cosmological scales (1kpc - 3000Mpc) correspond to the event horizon lengths when χ  ~  4Mp. Thus, at the end of inflation ti ([formula]), the fluctuations of φa amount to

[formula]

At the critical epoch t* when the Peccei-Quinn scalar settles down to one of two minima of the potential (i.e. φa  ~  Fa), the change ΔA of the amplitude A of φa per one oscillation is given by

[formula]

where ω is the frequency ([formula]), H* is the Hubble constant at the critical epoch. Here we have assumed that the total energy density is always dominated by the inflaton and radiations produced through the decay of the inflaton. If the dynamics is pure classical and the initial fluctuations δφa  /  φa is less than ΔA / A, it is expected that φa settles down to the same minimum and no domain walls are formed. ( This criterion for domain wall production is confirmed by numerical calculation in ref. [\cite=KK].) From eqs. ([\ref=delta-phi/phi]) and ([\ref=delta-A/A]), the condition for no domain wall production is written as

[formula]

Notice that this condition is independent of the coupling g. However, the actual dynamics is not pure classical because the oscillating φa-field decays into φa-particles and axions through parametric resonance [\cite=KKY]. Thus the condition ([\ref=Fa-const]) is modified if we take account of the φa decay. In fact, the effect of the parametric resonant decay on the formation of topological defects has been investigated in ref. [\cite=KK], and it is shown that the above condition ([\ref=Fa-const]) becomes more stringent as

[formula]

Since the above Peccei-Quinn scale is much higher than the usual values (i.e. ~  1012GeV), we should care about cosmic density of the axion. The density parameter Ωa of the axion is related by Fa as [\cite=Kolb-Turner]

[formula]

where h is the present Hubble constant in units of 100km/sec/Mpc. Since the fluctuations of θa are small in the present model, θa is almost homogeneous over the entire universe. Thus we can take θa in eq.([\ref=omega]) as a free parameter. Assuming that the axion is dark matter (Ωah2≃0.25), we obtain

[formula]

Next, we consider the isocurvature fluctuations of the axion. The fluctuations of the axion δa and the effective Peccei-Quinn scale "Fa" during inflation are given by H / (2π) and ``Fa" = φa, respectively. Since the axion phase θa is related to a / φa, the isocurvature fluctuations of the axion density (=  F2aδθ2a / 2) are given by

[formula]

where we use eq.([\ref=phi-chi-relation]).

On the other hand, the inflaton generates adiabatic fluctuations which amount to

[formula]

at horizon crossing (i.e. when wavelengths become equal to the horizon length). Then the ratio α of δ2iso to δ2ad is written by [\cite=KSY]

[formula]

The definition of α is the same as given in ref. [\cite=KSY] and α is the ratio of the power spectra of isocurvature and adiabatic fluctuations. Using eq.([\ref=theta]), α is given by

[formula]

where the inequality comes from eq.([\ref=Fa-const2]). Notice that g  ≥  λ≃10- 13 if the Peccei-Quinn scalar is not an inflaton. On the other hand, if Φa is an inflaton, g  =  λ≃10- 13. Thus g  ≥  10- 13 for any case. The upperbound on g is obtained from observations of large scale structure of the universe. The ratio α should be less than about 10, otherwise the isocurvature fluctuations become so large that the predicted power spectrum contradicts observations of large scale structure [\cite=KSY]. This gives constraints on g and Fa. The allowed range of g is (1 - 2.8)  ×  10- 13, and Fa should take (0.6 - 1.5)  ×  1015GeV which is close to scales of grand unifications. Furthermore, since g is almost the same as λ, it is natural to consider the Peccei-Quinn scalar an inflaton itself (i.e. g  =  λ).

The mixture of isocurvature and adiabatic fluctuations is astrophysically interesting because it gives a better fit to the observations of the large scale structure of the universe [\cite=KSY] than pure adiabatic fluctuations in standard cold dark matter (CDM) scenario. In the standard CDM scenario, the density fluctuations at scales of galaxies and clusters are too large if the power spectrum P(k) is normalized to the COBE data. For example, the amplitude of mass fluctuations at 8h- 1Mpc, σ8 is 1.4 for standard CDM with h = 0.5, while observed values of σ8 are 0.57 from galaxy cluster surveys [\cite=White-Efstathiou-Frenk], 0.75 from galaxy and cluster correlations [\cite=Peacock-Dodds] and 0.5 - 1.3 from peculiar velocity fields [\cite=Strauss-Willick]. However, since isocurvature fluctuations give six times larger contribution to CMBR anisotropies at COBE scales, the mixture of isocurvature fluctuations decreases the amplitude of the matter fluctuations and σ8 is reduced to ≃1  -  0.5 for α  =  1 - 10 [\cite=KSY].

Furthermore, anisotropies of CMBR in the present model can be distinguished from those produced by pure adiabatic fluctuations because the shape of power spectrum of CMBR anisotropies is quite different from that of pure adiabatic fluctuations at small angular scales. Since direct searches for the axion are impossible for Fa  ≫  1012GeV, the observations of the CMBR anisotropies by future satellite experiments are very crucial to test the present model.

In summary, we have studied the domain wall problem of axion in chaotic inflation models and showed that the production of domain walls is suppressed if the Peccei-Quinn scalar has a flat potential and its breaking Fa is larger than ~  1015GeV. We have also found that the observable amount of the isocurvature fluctuations is produced for such high Fa. The present model is consistent with observations if the self-coupling constant and the breaking scale of the Peccei-Quinn scalar are g≃(1 - 2.8)  ×  10- 13 and Fa≃(0.6 - 1.5)  ×  1015GeV. In particular the value of self-coupling constant is almost the same as that required for an inflaton, which suggests that the Peccei-Quinn scalar itself is the inflaton.
