The Next to Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM), proposed as a solution of the μ problem of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, has a discrete Z3 symmetry which is spontaneously broken at the electroweak phase transition, resulting in a cosmological domain wall problem. In most cases this domain wall problem cannot be solved by explicit Z3 breaking without introducing supergravity tadpole corrections which destabilize the weak scale hierarchy. Here we consider the possibility of solving the domain wall problem of the NMSSM via spontaneous discrete symmetry breaking occuring during inflation. For the case where the discrete symmetry breaking field has renormalizible couplings to the NMSSM fields, we find that the couplings must be less than 10- 5 if the reheating temperature is larger than 107GeV, but can be up to 10- 3 for reheating temperatures of the order of the electroweak phase transition temperature. For the case of non-renormalizible couplings, we present a model which can solve the domain wall problem for large reheating temperatures without requiring any very small coupling constants. In this model the domain walls are eliminated by a pressure coming from their interaction with a coherently oscillating scalar field whose phase is fixed during inflation. This oscillating scalar field typically decays after the electroweak phase transition but before nucleosynthesis, leaving no additional Z3 symmetry breaking in the zero-temperature theory.

[formula]. Introduction.

The Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM) has become widely regarded as the most probable theory of physics beyond the Standard Model (SM), due to its ability to protect the weak scale from quadratically divergent radiative corections [\cite=nilles]. However, the MSSM requires, in order to give an expectation value to both Higgs doublets, the introduction of a SUSY mass parameter for the Higgs doublets, μ, which has no obvious reason to be of the order of mW, although some mechanisms have been suggested in the context of supergravity models [\cite=gm]. (We will refer to this as the μ problem). One particularly simple and attractive solution of the μ problem is to extend the MSSM to the Z3 symmetric Next to Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) [\cite=nilles] [\cite=nmssm] [\cite=ets]. This adds a scalar superfield N to the MSSM whose expectation value provides an effective μ term for the Higgs doublets. The μ term is naturally of the order of the weak scale so long as the Z3 symmetry is imposed. However, the Z3 symmetry introduces a cosmological problem in the case where the reheating temperature after inflation is large compared with the weak scale, namely the formation of stable domain walls [\cite=dwp] [\cite=dwp2] due to sponanteous breaking of the Z3 symmetry at the electroweak phase transition [\cite=saw].

In order to eliminate these domain walls, a Z3 symmetry breaking which has the same phase over the region corresponding to the observable Universe must be introduced into the effective weak scale theory. However, any explicit Z3 symmetry breaking (even if due to Planck-scale suppressed non-renormalizible operators) will almost certainly destabilize the weak scale by allowing quadratically divergent gauge singlet tadpole diagrams which appear in the full supergravity theory [\cite=saw] [\cite=bag]. (However, for the special case where the Z3 is embedded in a gauged R-symmetry, such corrections can be avoided [\cite=abel]).

The obvious alternative is to consider spontaneous Z3 symmetry breaking due to a new gauge singlet scalar field, S, whose initial value is fixed during inflation. This ensures that the resulting discrete symmetry breaking phase is the same over the whole observable Universe. In this paper we will discuss whether such a possibility can be implemented in a natural way, in the sense of not requiring extremely small coupling constants. We will consider two different approaches. One approach is based on coupling S directly to the NMSSM via renormalizible couplings. The second is based on having only non-renormalizible couplings of S to the NMSSM sector, suppressed by powers of the Planck scale or some intermediate mass scale.

We first outline the cosmological scenario we have in mind. We will consider the simplest scenario, in which there is an initial period of inflation due to the energy density of an inflaton field, which subsequently oscillates coherently about the minimum of its potential until it decays, leaving the Universe radiation dominated at a reheating temperature TR [\cite=hm2]. TR should be low enough not to thermally regenerate gravitinos [\cite=gravb] [\cite=eu] (TR  <~  108 - 109GeV for gravitino masses in the range 100GeV to 500GeV [\cite=gravb2]), implying that the value of the expansion rate of the Universe at TR, H(TR), should be less than 1GeV. Between the end of inflation and the beginning of radiation domination the Universe is dominated by the energy density of the coherent inflaton oscillations. An important point to note is that the Universe does not "reheat" as such. During the inflaton oscillation dominated period the decay of the inflaton results in a themal background of particles with a temperature Tr  ≈  kr(MPlHT2R)1 / 4 (where [formula] is approximately equal to 0.4 for temperatures larger than 100 GeV), the energy density of which eventually comes to dominate the energy density of the Universe at TR [\cite=hm2]. The magnitude of the density perturbations observed by the Cosmic Background Explorer implies that H  ≈  1014GeV during inflation, assuming that the density perturbations are due to quantum fluctuations [\cite=cobe]. Therefore it is possible that Tr could exceed 109GeV at the end of inflation, even if TR is less than 109GeV. In general Tr is given by

[formula]

Although it might seem that Tr  >~  109GeV would require a tighter bound on TR in order to evade the thermal regeneration of gravitinos, it is straightforward to show that the rapid increase of H as a function of T during the inflaton oscillation dominated period, [formula], ensures that the gravitinos generated thermally during this period never exceed those generated around TR. Thus it is sufficient to impose TR  <~  109GeV. On the other hand, we will find that the higher temperatures which exist during the inflaton oscillation dominated period must be taken into account when considering constraints on the couplings following from the requirement that the Z3 symmetry is not thermally restored before the NMSSM domain walls form.

It has become clear that in many inflation models based on supergravity, the scalar fields will obtain order H2 SUSY breaking mass squared terms as a result of the non-zero energy density which exists in the early Universe [\cite=hm2] [\cite=hm]. (A possible exception is the case of D-term inflation, depending on the details of the model [\cite=dti]). If such mass squared terms happen to be negative, then any scalar field with a flat scalar potential will have a large initial expectation value which is fixed during inflation. This is in contrast with the case of potentials having hidden sector SUSY breaking mass squared terms, which have a fixed value, m2s, which is typically of the order of (100GeV)2. (By "hidden sector" mass terms we mean those coming from a supergravity hidden sector breaking mechanism [\cite=nilles]). In this case the fields cannot roll to the minimum of their potentials during inflation since H is much larger than ms and the fields are overdamped. Therefore they will have random initial values. The role of the H2 mass terms in our discussion will be to fix the initial values of the fields at the end of inflation to be at a non-zero minimum of the scalar potential, with a single discrete symmetry breaking phase througout the observed region of the Universe. It is interesting to ask whether the domain wall problem can be solved with random initial values of the fields at the end of inflation, as in the case without the order H2 mass terms, but we will not address this question here.

There are then two possible scenarios for the cosmological evolution of the S expectation value, depending on the sign of m2s. If this is negative, the S expectation value will remain large and constant once the hidden sector mass squared term comes to dominate the order H2 term during the expansion of the Universe. On the other hand, if it is positive, the S scalar will begin to oscillate coherently once m2s dominates the H2 term. If these Z3 symmetry breaking expectation values can survive down to temperatures less than that of the electroweak phase transition, Tew, (at which the Z3 domain walls form), then we may be able to use the interaction of < S >  with the NMSSM sector fields to eliminate the domain walls.

However, we will see that it is not so easy to achieve a natural solution of the domain wall problem. On the one hand, we have to provide a large enough vacuum energy density splitting between the different Z3 domains to provide sufficient pressure to drive away the domain walls. On the other hand, for the case of the negative hidden sector mass squared term, we have to ensure that the Z3 symmetry is not thermally restored while at the same time ensuring that the S expectation value does not give a large mass to the scalars in the NMSSM sector responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking. For the case of the coherently oscillating S scalar, we have to ensure that the S field is not thermalized before the electroweak phase transition and that it decays after the electroweak phase transition but not so late that it disrupts the predictions of standard big-bang nucleosynthesis [\cite=gravb2].

We define the transformation of a field φ with charge Q(φ) under a discrete symmetry by φ  →  ei2πQφ ([formula]). The simplest extension of the NMSSM is then obtained by considering the Z3 charge of S to be equal to that of N, Q(S)  =  1 / 3. The superpotential of the model is given by W  =  WNMSSM  +  WS, where

[formula]

is the standard Z3 symmetric NMSSM superpotential [\cite=nilles] [\cite=nmssm] [\cite=ets] [\cite=saw] and

[formula]

gives the couplings of S to the NMSSM fields. In addition we will have soft SUSY breaking terms of the form [\cite=hm]

[formula]

where φi are the scalar fields and Wα are the trilinear superpotential terms. (Aα  ~  ms  ±  H in the presence of non-zero H, with the sign of the H correction being model dependent [\cite=hm]). With these superpotential and soft SUSY breaking terms, the S scalar potential is assumed to be given by

[formula]

The expectation value of S is then given by

[formula]

(We have neglected the Aλ1 term, which can alter < S >  by at most factor of the order of 1).

In this we have ignored the N expectation value. In fact, a non zero < N >  will generally exist at the minimum together with < S > . This could result in a large effective μ term and affect the natural generation of the weak scale. We will discuss N expectation value and its consequences later in this section.

We first consider the conditions under which there is no thermal restoration of the Z3 symmetry. This requires that the S2 term in the finite temperature effective potential [\cite=eu] [\cite=dj] remains negative for all values of T for which the S condensate scalars are in thermal equilibrium.

The N particles and Higgs particles Hi will contribute to the S finite-temperature effective potential if they are lighter than T. In fact, they will be lighter than T for T large compared with Tew, since any N or Hi mass term due to < S >  cannot be very large compared with the weak scale without disrupting electroweak symmetry breaking [\cite=ets]. The S particles orthogonal to < S > , which we denote by S', will also gain a mass from < S >  and can contribute to the finite temperature effective potential. The condition for these particles to be light compared with T for H  <~  ms is that

[formula]

which will generally be satisfied for T  >~  Tew. (We need not consider the constraints for H  >~  ms, since in this case the soft SUSY breaking mass squared in the scalar potential becomes of the order of H2, which will increase with T much faster then the thermal T2 correction, thus ensuring that the Z3 symmetry remains broken at H  >~  ms if it is broken for all H  <~  ms). The effective SUSY N mass from the λ3 coupling is then given by mN(S)  =  2λ3S. Similar contributions will come from λ1 and λ2.

We must then ensure that the temperature dependent contribution to the S2 term in the finite temperature effective potential due to mN, m2N(S)T2 / 8, is small compared with m2sS2 for all T  <~  Teq, where Teq is the temperature at which the S scalars come into thermal equilibrium. The dominant process bringing the S scalars into thermal equilibrium with the light particles in the thermal background will be inverse decays, with a rate [formula] (where the factor κd is not too small compared with 1; for the case of stop quarks this has been estimated to be typically of the order of 0.1 [\cite=enqrot]). If Teq  <~  TR, then the thermal equilibrium condition Γinv  >~  H occurs during radiation domination and Teq is given by

[formula]

where the expansion rate during radiation domination is given by [formula], with kT(T)  ≈  16 for T larger than around 100GeV [\cite=eu]. This is consistent with Teq  <~  TR if

[formula]

If this is not satisfied then Teq  >~  TR and, with H(T) given by H(T)  =  T4(k4rT2RMPl)- 1, the thermal equilibrium temperature becomes

[formula]

The Z3 symmetry remains broken at Teq if λi  <~  ms / Teq. For Teq  <~  TR this requires that

[formula]

where we have used kT  ≈  16. This is the condition for avoiding Z3 symmetry restoration if TR  >~  107GeV. If TR is less than 107GeV, the upper limit on λi occurs when Teq  >  TR and the condition that the Z3 symmetry remains broken at Teq becomes

[formula]

For TR  =  102GeV  (105GeV) this requires that λi  <~  10- 3  (10- 4). Thus we see that, for the case of m2s  <  0 and renormalizible S couplings to the NMSSM sector, the couplings of S to N and to the Higgs fields must be rather small if the reheating temperature is large compared with Tew, in order not to thermally restore the Z3 symmetry. In particular, if the reheating temperature is close to the gravitino upper limit, then these couplings must be less than around 10- 5.

We have not yet discussed the elimination of the domain walls. We will discuss this in more detail later, but for now we merely note that it is very easy to introduce large < S >  dependent contributions into the N scalar potential. For example, from the superpotential couplings k and λ2, we obtain a term in the scalar potential

[formula]

However, if we assume that k is not very small compared with 1, such that 2k  >  λ2, then λ2 must be smaller than λ21 / k in order to avoid introducing a mass term for the N scalars much larger than 102GeV. In the NMSSM broken by radiative corrections, the phenomenologically favoured region of parameter space has < N >   >~  1TeV. In this case the N particles essentially decouple and one has an effective MSSM with [formula] and a contribution to the soft SUSY breaking "B-term" given by ν  =  k < N >  [\cite=ets]. Both of these cannot be very much larger than 102GeV without disrupting the natural generation of the weak scale. (It is possible to have very large < N > , so long as λN and k are correspondingly small. The condition for a weak scale μ term is then that λN / k  ~  1 [\cite=ets]). The effect of a large mass term from equation (13) would be to introduce an effective negative mass squared, m2N  eff, for the N scalars, with the N expectation being given by < N >   ≈  |mN  eff| / k, which would result in ν  ≈  |mN  eff| [\cite=ets]. Requiring that ν be small compared with a mass scale m* not much larger than 102GeV and that the no-thermalization condition (12) is satisfied then implies that

[formula]

(For TR  >~  107GeV the upper bound from (14) with TR  ≈  107GeV applies). Thus for large reheating temperatures, TR  >~  107GeV, we would require that λ2  <~  10- 7(0.01 / k) in order to avoid a mass term for the N scalars much larger than 102GeV. For smaller TR this upper bound becomes weaker, allowing λ2 to be as large as 10- 3(0.01 / k) for TR  ≈  102GeV. Therefore, unless k  <~  10- 4 (and, since λN / k  ~  1 is necessary [\cite=ets], λN  <~  10- 4), for large TR there will be a tighter upper bound on some of the couplings than that coming from Z3 symmetry restoration.

We next consider the N expectation value. When < S >  is introduced into the N - S scalar potential, terms linear, quadratic and cubic in N arise, which result in a non-zero < N > . In general it is difficult to discuss the minimization of the potential analytically, but for the natural case where the couplings λi (i=1,2,3) all have the same magnitude and |k| is large compared with |λi|, and where < N >  does not alter the value of < S >  significantly, we find that < N >  is essentially determined by the linear and quartic terms in the N scalar potential. In this case < N >  is given by

[formula]

(This will not affect the value of < S >  so long as < N >  is small compared with < S > ). The main effect of < N >  will be to introduce an effective μ term for the Higgs doublets via the λN superpotential coupling,

[formula]

Since λN and k must be of the same order of magnitude to naturally generate a weak scale μ term, we see that λi cannot be too small compared with k, thus favouring large λi and/or small k. We note that < S >  also introduces a μ term via the λSH superpotential coupling. This will be acceptable so long as λSH is not larger than (λ21  +  λ22)1 / 2.

We should check that spontaneous breaking of the discrete symmetry does not introduce dangerous quadratic divergences. A quadratically divergent tadpole arises at two-loops in N = 1 supergravity with hidden sector SUSY breaking and no direct coupling of the hidden and observable sectors in the Kahler potential [\cite=bag]. With a Kahler potential given by

[formula]

corresponding to minimal scalar kinetic terms, and superpotential terms of the form [\cite=bag]

[formula]

a divergent N tadpole is generated

[formula]

On introducing the hidden sector SUSY breaking F-term for K, [formula] with [formula], there is a contribution to the N scalar potential of the form [\cite=bag]

[formula]

Taking the cut-off Λ to be MPl, we find that the additional term in the N scalar potential is of the form [formula], where [formula]. If [formula] is much larger than 102GeV, this term will make impossible the generation of a naturally weak scale μ term. Throughout this paper we will consider the natural value of non-renormalizible couplings such as λα to be of the order of 1, with the strength of the couplings set by the large mass scale which we will take to be the Planck scale. In this case we would require that λ  <~  10- 12 in order to have [formula]. In the case where discrete symmetry breaking is spontaneous and non-vanishing at zero temperature, we can still have quadratically divergent tadpoles. For example, for S with charge Q(S)  =  1 / 3, one can have a non-renormalizible operator of the form of the λα term but with an overall factor of [formula]. For S with charge Q(S) = 1 / 6 this factor becomes [formula]. As a result, the quadratically divergence is not a problem for all λ  <~  1 if < S >   <~  1013GeV for the Q(S)  =  1 / 3 case and < S >   <~  1016GeV for the Q(S)  =  1 / 6 case. From equation (6) we see that, for ms  ≈  102GeV, < S >   <~  1013GeV requires that (λ21  +  λ22)1 / 2  >~  10- 11. This can be easily satisfied.

In this case we will have a coherently oscillating S scalar. We have to ensure that the Z3-breaking condensate does not thermalize or decay before the electroweak phase transition.

The requirement that the condensate does not thermalize via inverse decays imposes the constraint,

[formula]

where we have assumed that the Universe is radiation dominated. Thus, with T  ≈  Tew, this requires that λi  <~  10- 8. (Below Tew the S', Hi and N particles gain masses from electroweak symmetry breaking). This constraint should be applied if the masses of the S', Hi and N particles due to < S >  are small compared with T. During the inflaton oscillation dominated era, the energy density of the S oscillations scales as that in the inflaton oscillations, whilst after reheating the energy density of S oscillations scales as a(T)- 3 , where a(T) is the scale factor. Thus the energy density during radiation domination at T  <  TR is given by

[formula]

where ρo is the initial energy density of the S condensate and [formula]. The the corresponding amplitude of the S oscillations at temperature T is [formula], where So is the initial amplitude of the oscillations. The condition that the mass of the particles due to their interaction with the condensate [\cite=ad], λiS(T), is less than T then becomes

[formula]

This will be easily satisfied for Tew  <~  T  <~  TR. Therefore (21) applies. We should also check that the energy density is not dominated by the coherent S oscillations. This is satisfied if λ21  +  λ22  >~  10- 28m2s / T, which is typically easily satisfied.

Under the assumption that the S condensate particles are heavy enough to decay directly to a two-body final state via the coupling λi, with a rate [formula], the requirement that the condensate does not decay before temperature T imposes the constraint

[formula]

This will give an even tighter constraint on λi than the no-thermalization constraint (21) if the coherent oscillations have to survive down to a temperature much lower than the electroweak phase transition in order to eliminate the domain walls, as is likely to be the case in the NMSSM [\cite=saw].

We next consider the conditions under which the S condensate can eliminate the NMSSM domain walls. This requires that the pressure due to the energy difference ΔV between the domains is large enough to cause the higher energy domains to collapse on the time scale H(T)- 1 [\cite=dwp] [\cite=dwp2] [\cite=dwp3]. The condition on ΔV depends on whether the domain walls are relativistic or not, i.e. whether there are significant frictional forces due to the interaction of the domain walls with the thermal background particles. If there are strong frictional forces, then the walls will expand until the force due to surface tension is balanced by the friction, which will occur at a radius much less than the horizon H- 1(T). The pressure due to ΔV must then overcome this large frictional force. If there are effectively no frictional forces, meaning that the surface tension can overcome the frictional forces for relativistic walls of radius equal to the horizon, then the condition on ΔV will be typically much weaker. For the case of an unbroken Z3 symmetry, the conventional view would be that there are no (or at least highly suppressed) frictional forces, since the particles crossing the domain walls would have equal masses on either side of the wall and so would transfer no net momentum to the wall on passing through [\cite=dwp3] [\cite=dwp4]. However, it has been suggested that, on taking into account the change in the particle masses in the vicinity of the wall, there will be a non-zero reflection coefficient, leading to a large frictional force until the heavier particles become Boltzmann suppressed at temperatures less than around that of the quark-hadron phase transition, after which the domain walls become relativistic on the scale of the horizon [\cite=saw]. In more detail, the friction force per unit area on the wall is estimated to be [formula], where m is the mass of the heaviest thermal background particle with m  <  T, g is the number of degrees of freedom of the particle and v is the velocity of the wall [\cite=saw]. This force rapidly decreases as T decreases and the heavier thermal particles become Boltzmann suppressed. The condition on ΔV to eliminate the domain walls, ΔV  >~  f, will be most easily satisfied once the frictional force is weak enough to allow the domain walls to remain relativistic up to scales of the order of the horizon. Thereafter, the condition will become more difficult to satisfy as T decreases, since the pressure difference between the domains rapidly decreases as < S >  decreases with T.

Suppose the domain walls become relativistic on horizon scales at Trel. Soon after Trel, the uncollapsed domain walls will have a radius of the order of the horizon H(Trel)- 1. This will continue to be true until the pressure due to ΔV dominates the force due to the surface tension σ. This in general occurs once the radius of a domain is larger than a critical radius, rc, given by

[formula]

The smallest |ΔV| will therefore correspond to the largest possible rc, the horizon radius. Although the Z3 domain wall will consist of the Standard Model Higgs fields as well as the N field, for simplicity we will consider the wall to be made only of the N field. In this case the domain wall potential will be due to the soft SUSY breaking N3 A-term and the surface tension will be σ  ≈  ms < N > 2 [\cite=dwp2] [\cite=dwp3].

From the superpotential couplings λ2 and k we obtain an energy density splitting between the different Z3 vacuum states

[formula]

This depends on the value of S2 and so will have a non-zero value on averaging over the S oscillations. The condition that this can overcome the surface tension for horizon-sized relativistic domains at Trel is then that

[formula]

The left-hand side will be smallest for λ1  <~  λ2, so we require that

[formula]

Therefore we see that the requirement that ΔV is large enough to eliminate the domain walls imposes a very tight constraint on at least some of the couplings. A similar S2 dependent contribution to ΔV, ΔV  ≈  2λ1λ3S2N2, arises from the superpotential couplings λ1 and λ3. For this to eliminate the domain walls we would require that

[formula]

which would demand even smaller values of λ1 and λ2 once the no-thermalization and decay constraints, (21) and (24), are imposed.

Thus we can conclude that, for the case of renormalizible couplings of the Z3 symmetry breaking scalar S to the NMSSM, very small couplings (less than 10- 8 and in some cases less than 10- 13) are required in order to eliminate the NMSSM domain walls if the hidden sector mass squared of S is positive. If it is negative, small couplings   <~  10- 5 (and even smaller if the NMSSM couplings k and λN are larger than 10- 4) are again required if the reheating temperature is larger than 107GeV, but, for smaller values of TR, the constraints from avoiding thermal restoration of the Z3 symmetry become somewhat weaker, allowing couplings as large as 10- 3 for TR  ≈  Tew.

.

We have seen that the case of renormalizible S couplings to the NMSSM sector requires rather small couplings when the reheating temperature is large (less than 10- 5 for the case where the reheating temperature is larger than 107GeV, with an even smaller upper bound if the NMSSM N couplings are not less than about 10- 4). In particular, for the case of a positive hidden sector mass squared for the S scalar, some couplings must be less than about 10- 13, regardless of the reheating temperature. One way to overcome the need for such small couplings might be to simply eliminate all the renormalizible couplings of the S scalar to the NMSSM fields, allowing only non-renormalizible couplings suppressed by powers of some large mass scale (which we will take to be the Planck scale). This is naturally achieved by extending the Z3 symmetry of the NMSSM to a discrete symmetry, which we will call ZA, under which the charge of S is such that no renormalizible couplings of S to the NMSSM fields are possible.

In this case there will be a large and constant expectation value for the S scalar once H  <~  ms. This large expectation value will introduce what we believe to be a generic problem in this case, namely a very large SUSY mass for N, much larger than the weak scale. To see this, consider the simplest example, corresponding to S having a ZA charge 1/6 whilst N, as usual, has charge 1 / 3. Then S can only have leading order non-renormalizible superpotential couplings of the form

[formula]

The expectation value following from the S scalar potential,

[formula]

gives, with ms  ≈  102GeV and λS  ≈  1, < S >   ≈  5  ×  1014GeV. This results in an SUSY mass for N of the order of 1010GeV, making a solution of the μ problem impossible in this case. We find that decreasing the ZA charge of S or introducing an intermediate mass scale (in the manner of the model to be described in the following section) only increases the N mass. Based on this, we conclude that the case of S scalars with non-renormalizible couplings and a negative hidden sector mass squared is unlikely to provide a natural solution of the NMSSM domain wall problem. .

So far we have found no model which can solve the NMSSM domain wall problem for reheating temperatures much larger than the electroweak phase transition temperature without requiring small couplings. We now present a model, based on a coherently oscillating scalar, which can eliminate the domain wall problem of the NMSSM for values of TR as large as the gravitino upper bound and which does not require any small couplings.

The model we consider requires, in addition to the NMSSM singlet N and the ZA breaking field S, two additional singlet fields, X and B. X will acquire an intermediate mass as a result of an expectation value for B. The model is also assumed to have a more complicated discrete symmetry, ZA  ×  ZB, where ZA is the extension of the original NMSSM Z3 whilst ZB is a discrete symmetry under which all the NMSSM fields are singlets. ZB is introduced in order to control the non-renormalizible terms. The discrete symmetry charges of the fields are as defined in Table 1(a). Table 1(a). Field charges under ZA  ×  ZB.

It may well be significant that the ZA  ×  ZB charges of the remaining NMSSM fields can always be chosen to eliminate the dangerous renormalizible B and L violating operators ucdcdc, dcQL and ecLL [\cite=nilles]. For example, this is true for the charges of Table 1(b). Therefore the absence of these renormalizible interactions could be interpreted as a sign of the existence of a non-trivial discrete symmetry such as ZA  ×  ZB, rather than of a simple R-parity or conservation of B and L. Table 1(b). Example of field charges eliminating dangerous renormalizible operators.

The superpotential of the model is then given by

[formula]

where WX is the allowed renormalizible coupling of X,

[formula]

and WNR gives the leading order non-renormalizible superpotential couplings involving the additional gauge singlet scalars,

[formula]

The model will require an intermediate mass for the X scalar. This will be generated by an expectation value for B. The obvious possibility is to assume that the hidden sector mass squared of the B scalar is negative, which would result in an expectation value for B given by,

[formula]

However, we should perhaps note that in this case there could be problem due to the late decay of oscillations of the weakly coupled B scalar around the minimum of its potential. The B scalar has a mass of the order of ms, whilst the X particles to which it couples gain a mass of the order of 1010GeV as a result of < B > . Thus the B decay rate will be highly suppressed in this case. If the B field is not very close to the minimum of its potential at the end of inflation, its coherent oscillations about the minimum of its potential will decay long after nucleosynthesis and could dominate the energy density of the Universe when they decay. This is all dependent upon the value of B at the end of inflation and the dynamics of its subsequent evolution as the Universe expands and its effective (negative) O(H2) SUSY breaking mass term decreases. Since in our model the B field only serves to generate an intermediate mass for X and, in a sense, may be regarded as a toy field representing the dynamics of a more realistic model, we will not concern ourselves with the details of this issue here.

In general we will consider MX  >~  1010GeV. One reason for this choice, as we will show later, is that it ensures that the X particles are Boltzmann suppressed for all temperatures, thus eliminating the possibility of thermalization of the S condensate by light thermal X particles. Integrating out the massive X field, we obtain the following effective interaction in the superpotential

[formula]

This is valid so long as λa < S >   <~  MX, such that the mixing between the X and N fields via the coupling (33) may be neglected. This interaction is fundamentally important in what follows, as it will allow both a sufficiently rapid decay of the S oscillations so as to avoid problems with nucleosynthesis and at the same time allow a sufficiently strong interaction of the S oscillations with the N scalars to drive away the Z3 domain walls. Assuming that the S scalar mass is large enough, the S scalars will decay to N particles and S fermions (which will be highly decoupled and will typically have a mass not much larger than 1eV, coming from the interaction (36) with < N >   ~  100GeV - 1TeV). So long as their energy density is sufficiently small compared with than that of the radiation when they are produced, the S fermions will not give rise to any cosmological problems. (This may be difficult to achieve, however, if the Universe is dominated by the S scalars when they decay, since one would expect approximately 1/3 of the energy density from S decays to be in the form of S fermions. Alternatively, for the charge assignment of Table 1(b), one can obtain an operator of the same form as equation (36) but with S2N2  →  SNHuL, which can allow the S scalars to safely decay to NMSSM fields).

The S scalar potential is given by

[formula]

The initial value of the S field when the oscillations begin at H  ≈  ms, So, is therefore given by

[formula]

We first consider the conditions under which the S energy density decays at a temperature less than that of electroweak phase transition, Tew, without disturbing the predictions of nucleosynthesis. This requires either that the ratio of the energy density in the S scalars to that in radiation when the S scalars decay, rD, is less than 10- 6, in order not to photodissociate the helium abundance [\cite=gravb2] [\cite=helium], or that the S scalars decay at a temperature greater than around 10MeV [\cite=hadron]. The former condition requires that

[formula]

The S scalars in the condensate decay via the interaction of equation (36) with a rate given approximately by

[formula]

where [formula] and we are assuming that the S scalars are heavy compared with the N particles. This gives for the decay temperature, assuming that decay occurs during radiation domination,

[formula]

Therefore, in the case where decay occurs after nucleosynthesis at Td  <~  1MeV, we require from equation (39) that the reheating temperature satisfies,

[formula]

where

[formula]

Thus with rD  ≈  10- 6, γ  ≈  10- 4, mS  ≈  102GeV and MX  >~  1010GeV, this requires that TR  <~  α1 / 2dλ2a104GeV. This imposes a severe restriction on TR for λa  <~  0.1. On the other hand, from equation (41), we see that it is quite likely that Td  >~  10MeV. In general, Td is given by

[formula]

Therefore, in this case we expect that, for MX  ≈  1010GeV (which will be seen to be the preferred order of magnitude for MX in this model), the S oscillations will typically decay at a temperature between 10MeV and 1GeV for λa in the range 0.1 to 1. The amplitude of the S oscillations at T  <  TR (assuming that the Universe is radiation dominated) is given by

[formula]

The corresponding energy density in the coherent S oscillations is ρS  ≈  m2sS2. This will come to dominate the radiation energy density once T  <~  Tdom, where

[formula]

Thus if the domain walls become relativistic below Tdom, the elimination of the domain walls by the condensate will occur whilst the Universe is dominated by the energy density of the oscillating S field and possibly whilst the background radiation is dominated by radiation coming from the decays of the condensate scalars. In the case where the S scalars decay during matter domination, it would seem that equation (41), derived assuming radiation domination, is not correct. However, since the decay condition is given by [formula] and since the radiation energy of the Universe when all the S scalars decay will simply be given by ρS at this time, the decay temperature will be the same as that given in equation (41).

We must also ensure that the S condensate is not thermalized by scattering processes involving the thermal background particles. We first show that the X particles are always heavier than T and so Boltzmann suppressed if the coupling λa is not too small compared with 1. The mass of the X particles from the X - N mass matrix is given by [formula]. Therefore [formula] if MX  >~  1010GeV. Since, from equation (1), Tr at H  ≈  ms is given by

[formula]

we see that [formula] for all H less than ms. At H  ≈  ms the X mass will be given by [formula] so long as [formula]. Assuming that this is satisfied, we see that since [formula] for H  >~  ms, [formula] will be larger than T for all temperatures after the end of inflation. Thus the X particles will not thermalize the condensate for λa  >~  10- 5.

We next consider whether the N particles can thermalize the condensate. The N particle mass from the X - N mass martix is given by [formula]. In the following, for simplicity, we will concentrate on the case of large TR, not much smaller than the gravitino upper bound, which is of most interest to us here. Smaller values of TR can be analysed in a similar way. Let TN be the temperature below which [formula] becomes less than T. Let Tc be the temperature below which λa < S >   <~  MX. Since for T  >~  Tc the N and X particles have the same mass and we have shown than [formula] for all T, [formula] can only become less than T at temperatures less than or equal to Tc. Assuming that Tc  <~  TR, Tc is given by

[formula]

Therefore with λa not too small, say in the range 0.01 to 1, this will be less than TR for MX  ≈  1010GeV and for reheating temperatures not much smaller than the gravitino upper bound. [formula] can only be less than T if TN  <~  Tc. In this case TN is given by

[formula]

This is indeed less than Tc if

[formula]

This will be easily satisfied for values of TR not much smaller than the gravitino upper bound, MX  ≈  1010GeV and λa in the range 0.01 to 1. Therefore in this case we must apply the no thermalization condition during radiation domination at TN. Thermalization will primarily occur via the effective interaction of equation (36). We treat the scattering of the thermal N particles from the zero momentum S condensate scalars as a simple scattering process involving S and N particles. The scattering rate for SψN  ↔  SψN is then given by

[formula]

Requiring that the no thermalization condition, Γsc  <~  H, be satisfied at TN, equation (48), then gives for the no thermalization constraint on TR,

[formula]

λa  <~  0.2 and MX  ≈  1010GeV will easily allow a range of values for TR below the gravitino upper bound to be consistent with no thermalization of the S condensate. Thus with, for example, λa  ≈  0.1, MX  ≈  1010GeV and TR  ≈  107 - 9GeV, the S condensate will evade thermalization and will safely decay at a temperature of around 10MeV.

We next consider the conditions under which the S condensate can eliminate the NMSSM domain walls. We first consider the case where the Universe is radiation dominated. The terms in the SUSY scalar potential responsible for the energy density splitting are given by

[formula]

This is explicitly dependent on the phase of the S field and has a non-zero average over time. It results in a splitting of energy density of the different N vacuum states, ΔV, given by

[formula]

Thus the condition for ΔV to be large enough to eliminate relativistic domain walls at a temperature T during radiation domination, ΔV(T)  >~  σH(T), becomes

[formula]

Since < S2  >   is proportional to T3, we see that this is most easily satisfied as soon as the walls become relativistic at Trel. Thus in order to eliminate the domain walls during radiation domination we require that

[formula]

For example, if we consider the domain wall to become relativistic shortly after the quark-hadron phase transition [\cite=saw], say at Trel  ≈  0.1GeV, and to be too strongly damped for the pressure due to ΔV to be able to collapse the domain walls at higher temperatures, then we obtain

[formula]

We have included a correction factor, fc, for the case where the domain walls become relativistic during S condensate matter domination rather than during radiation domination. We have shown that the Universe becomes matter dominated at a temperature Tdom, equation (45), which is in the tens of GeVs for TR close to the gravitino upper bound. In this case, for Trel  <  Tdom, we have to modify the domain wall constraint on TR. Once T  <~  Tdom, entropy will be effectively conserved and the radiation energy density will be mostly due to the primordial radiaiton. However, there will also be additional radiation due to the decay of the S condensate, with a temperature given by equation (1) with the replacement TR  →  Td. This radiation will dominate the primordial radiation once T  <~  T*, where

[formula]

Once T  <~  T* entropy is no longer effectively conserved and [formula] drops much more rapidly with T. The result of all this on the domain wall bound is to introduce a correction factor fc, where, for Trel  >  T*,

[formula]

and for Trel  <  T*

[formula]

The weakest lower bound on TR is obtained when Trel  >~  T*. Trel  >~  T* is satisfied if

[formula]

The lower bound on TR from requiring the elimination of the domain walls then becomes

[formula]

For example, this allows a range of reheating temperatures from TR  ≈  5  ×  106GeV up to the gravitino bound to be compatible with elimination of the domain walls at Trel  ≈  0.1GeV when λa is in the range 0.01 to 1, k  ≈  0.1 and MX  ≈  1010GeV.

Thus we see that, with λa  ≈  k  ≈  0.1, MX  ≈  1010GeV and TR  ≈  107 - 9GeV, the S condensate can evade thermalization, can safely decay before nucleosynthesis (at a temperature of around 10MeV) and can eliminate the NMSSM domain walls, without requiring any small renormalizible couplings.

We should note that the preferred order of magnitude for MX in this model is around 1010GeV. Values smaller than this make it difficult to satisfy the no thermalization constraint, equation (51), whilst values larger than this make it difficult to eliminate the domain walls, equation (61), and to ensure that the condensate decays before nucleosynthesis, equation (43).

So far we have not explained why it was necessary to introduce the second discrete symmetry ZB. In the absence of this discrete symmetry, we could have had an additional term in the non-renormalizible superpotential,

[formula]

where λb  ≈  1. On integrating out the X field, this would give an effective operator in the superpotential,

[formula]

which lifts the flat direction much earlier than the S6 superpotential term, such that

[formula]

As a result, the lower bound on TR from the requirement that the domain walls can be eliminated during radiation domination would become

[formula]

Even with k  ≈  λa  ≈  1 this would require that MX  <~  102GeV in order to allow reheating temperatures below the gravitino bound, making it impossible to avoid thermalizing the condensate.

Thus, with non-renormalizible couplings of S to the NMSSM fields, the Z3 domain wall problem of the NMSSM can be solved even if the renormalizible couplings are large and the reheating temperature is not small compared with the gravitino upper bound. The introduction of an intermediate mass scale of the order of 1010GeV is essential for the solution of the domain wall problem in this case, since it provides non-renormalizible operators which are strong enough to enable the oscillating scalar field to decay fast enough to avoid problems with nucleosynthesis and to allow it to provide a sufficiently large pressure to eliminate the NMSSM domain walls whilst still being weak enough to prevent thermalization of the discrete symmetry breaking scalar condensate before the NMSSM domain walls have formed.

We have considered the possibility of solving the NMSSM Z3 domain wall problem by spontaneous discrete symmetry breaking occuring during inflation. For the case of renormalizible couplings of the discrete symmetry breaking scalar S to the NMSSM sector we find that, if the S scalar has a negative hidden sector mass squared term, then it is possible to solve the NMSSM domain wall problem without requiring extremely small couplings so long as the reheating temperature is not very large compared with that of the electroweak phase transition. Reheating temperatures larger than 107GeV would require the couplings to be less than 10- 5. A solution with a positive hidden sector mass squared for S always requires very small couplings and so seems generally unnatural.

For the case of non-renormalizible, Planck-scale suppressed operators, a negative hidden sector mass squared solution appears generally ruled out by the generation of a large SUSY mass for the N field of the NMSSM. For the case of a positive hidden sector mass squared, we find that it is possible to solve the NMSSM domain wall problem via a coherently oscillating S scalar without any small couplings, even if the reheating temperature after inflation is large. This requires the introduction of an intermediate mass scale of the order of 1010GeV, in order to allow the S scalars to decay without cosmological problems, and an additional discrete symmetry in order to control the allowed non-renormalizible terms and so avoid suppressing the density of coherent S scalars.

Although we have concentrated on the Z3-symmetric NMSSM, the coherently oscillating scalar mechanism for eliminating weak scale domain walls in SUSY models should have rather general applications to any SUSY model with a weak scale domain wall problem, for example, SUSY models with spontaneous CP violation or spontaneous R-parity violation at the 100GeV to 1TeV scale. In these cases, given the sensitivity of the strong CP parameter [formula] to explicit CP violating terms and the baryon number violation rate to explicit R-parity breaking terms, it may well be advantageous to have a discrete symmetry breaking expectation value which vanishes at zero temperature, as happens in the case of the coherently oscillating scalar mechanism.
