MULTIPION SYMMETRIZATION EFFECTS ON THE SOURCE DISTRIBUTION

Introduction

Multipion Bose-Einstein(BE) correlations has now aroused great interests among physicists [\cite=Re] [\cite=LL] [\cite=Za] [\cite=Pr] [\cite=CGZ] [\cite=ZCG] [\cite=ZC] [\cite=CZ] [\cite=Z1] [\cite=Z2] [\cite=Z3] [\cite=SL] [\cite=M1] [\cite=M2] [\cite=BK] [\cite=Wo] [\cite=FWW] [\cite=BZ] [\cite=Ur] [\cite=conf] [\cite=ZSH] [\cite=AL]. Among others, Lam and Lo [\cite=LL] were the first to suggest BASER concept in high energy physics. Zajc [\cite=Za] was the first to use Monte-Carlo methods to study multipion BE correlations effects on two-pion interferometry for fixed pion multiplicity event. Pratt [\cite=Pr] first suggested that multipion BE symmetrization effects may lead to BE condensate in high energy heavy-ion collisions. Detail derivation of multipion BE correlation effects on single particle spectrum and two-pion interferometry was given by Chao, Gao and I in Ref. [\cite=CGZ]. Recently Zimányi and Csörg o suggested a new class density matrix and study multipion BE correlations and wavepacket effects on two-pion interferometry [\cite=ZC] [\cite=CZ]. In Ref. [\cite=Z2], I have derived any-order pion interferometry formula for a special class density matrix. In Ref. [\cite=Z3], generalized any-order pion interferometry formulas are given which depends not only on the correlator as assumed previously but also on the pion multiplicity distribution which was neglected in the previous studies. Multipion BE correlation effects on the source distribution was studied in Ref. [\cite=ZSH]. This paper is arranged as follows: In section 2, any-order pion interferometry formula for fixed pion multiplicity event are given. In section 3, any-order pion interferometry formula for mixed events are derived. In section 4, methods on multipion BE correlation simulation are discussed. Conclusions are given in section five.

Any-order pion interferometry formulas for fixed pion multiplicity events

Assume the source is totally chaotic. It is easily checked that the n-pion inclusive distribution in n-pion event can be expressed as [\cite=CGZ]

[formula]

with

[formula]

Here g(x,k) is a Wigner function which can be explained as the probability of fnding a pion at point x with momentum p. σ(j) denotes the j-th element of a permutations of the sequence {1,2,  ·    ·    ·  ,n}, and the sum over σ denotes the sum over all n! permutations of this sequence. Then the normalized k pion inclusive distribution in n pion events can be expressed as

[formula]

It is easily checked that Pkn(1,   ·      ·      ·   ,pk) can be re-written as

[formula]

with

[formula]

and

[formula]

Here σ(i) denotes the i-th element of a permutations of the sequence {1,2,  ·    ·    ·  ,k}, and the sum over σ denotes the sum over all k! permutations of this sequence. Then the k-pion (k  ≤  n) interferometry formula for n-pion evnets can be expressed as

[formula]

We assume the source distribution as

[formula]

Here n0 is a parameter. Then the multipion BE correlation effects on two-pion interferometry for fixed evnets are shown in Fig.1. It is easy to see that as pion multiplicity increases, multipion BE correlations effects on the two-pion interferometry effects becomes stronger. In the limit n  →    ∞   we have C2n = 1.

Any-order pion interferometry formula fo mixed events

In the experimental analyses, one normally mixed all events to study pion interferometry. The k-pion inclusive distribution can be expressed as

[formula]

Here Pn is the normalized pion multiplicity distribution. It is easily checked that

[formula]

then the k-pion interferometry formulas can be expressed as

[formula]

The discussion about the definition of two-pion interferometry formulas can be found in the paper by Miskowiec and Voloshin [\cite=MV] and can also be found in Ref. [\cite=ZSH]. Using Eq.(4) , the k-pion inclusive distribution can be expressed as [\cite=Z3]

[formula]

with

[formula]

It is interesting to notice that if [formula] as assumed in Ref. [\cite=Z2] [\cite=ZC] [\cite=Pr], we have the following modified k pion inclusive distribution [\cite=Z2]:

[formula]

with

[formula]

One interesting property about Eq.(15) is: Eq.(15) is very similar to the pure n pion inclusive distribution (Eq.(1)) but with a modified source distribution S(x,K) which satisfies

[formula]

Based on Eq.(16), we will study multipion BE correlations effects on the source distributions [\cite=ZSH]. From Eq.(16), the single particle spectrum distribution ,[formula], can be expressed as:

[formula]

Similarly the source distribution in coordinate space ,[formula], can be expressed as

[formula]

Assume the input g(x,p) as Eq.(8), multipion BE correlation effects on the source distribution are shown in Fig.2 and Fig.3. It is clear that as 〈n〉 increases, multipion BE correlations effects on the source distribution becomes stronger. Multipion BE correlation make pions concentrate in momentum and coordinate space. It is easily checked that the half width of the source distribution in momentum space and coordinate space Δeff and Reff satisfies the following relationship:

[formula]

If we take [formula]. we have [formula] and [formula]. The source size satisfy the minimal Heisenberg relationship. That is all pions are concentrated in a single phase space and pion condensate occurs. But the pion multiplicity distribution is Boson form:[formula].

In general, pion interferometry formula depends not only on the correlator ρi,j but also on Pn as shown in Eq.(12). The later property was neglected in the previous studies. Recently, Egger, Lipa and Buschbeck [\cite=ELB] results seems support the conclusion presented here. Previous studies based on pure multipion interferometry formulas have shown that the difference between three-pion interferometry and two-pion interferometry are not so larger [\cite=HZ97] [\cite=conf1]. Certainly, there is also another possibility that the there are some correlation among the emitted pions which was not include in the above derivation. So one needs more studies about the two-pion and higher-order pion interferometry!

If we assume the pion state as

[formula]

Here an is a parameter which connected with pion multiplicity distribution. |n >  is the non-normalized pion n pion state which can be expressed as

[formula]

Here [formula] is the pion creation operator and [formula] is the pion probability amplitude. Then the pion multiplicity distribution Pn can be expressed as

[formula]

The two-pion interferometry results for different Pn(different an)is shown in Fig.4. One can see clearly that there are big differences among the two-pion interferometry results for different Pn.

Monte-Carlo simulation of multipion interferometry

To put two-pion BE correlations in event generator has been studied by different authors [\cite=CGZP]. To put multipion BE correlations in event generator is a very difficult task as shown in Ref. [\cite=Za] [\cite=FWW]. Recently Fialkowski et al [\cite=FWW] used the methods of Bialas, Krzywicki [\cite=BK] and Wosiek [\cite=Wo] and implemented approximately multipion BE correlation in JETSET/PYTHIA to study multipion BE correlation effects on the W mass. Due to the fact that there is no space-time picture in the model JETSET, So they had to put ρij by hand. On the other hand for model which has space-time picture, one can construct g(x,p) according to following method [\cite=ZZZ] [\cite=ZC]: D(x,p) is a total classical function which is the output of the evnet generator and can be written down as:

[formula]

Here x(i) and p(i) are the i particle coordinate and momentum. The natural and easiest way to construct g(x,p) the semiclassical function is to replace the above delta function with a Gaussian wavepacket

[formula]

In general δxj (δpj) should not be the same. But for simplicity one can set them the same value and take [formula]. The same discussion can be found in the Ref. [\cite=PGG90]. Unfortunately the calculating work for the above methods to put multipion BE correlation in event generator is so large that a new method which enable us to implement quickly multipion correlation in event generator is a debate for physics in this field.

Conclusions

In the above, we mention nothing about the effects of flow [\cite=xxx] and resonance [\cite=yyy] on the pion interferometry. As our main interests is the BE statistical effects and the flow and resonance can be included in the function g(x,p). Certainly the multipion coulomb effects is still a open question in this field. Energy constraint effects on the pion interferometry can be studied by the method presented in Ref. [\cite=ZCG]. In this paper, we have derived any-order pion interferometry formula for fixed multipion events and for mixed events. In general pion interferometry formulas should depends on not only on the correlator but also on the pion multiplicity distribution which was neglected in previous studies. It is shown that as the pion multiplicity becomes very larger all pions concentrate in a single phase space and pion condensate occurs. But the pion multiplicity distribution is BE form. The methods to put multipion BE correlations in the event generator is discussed.
