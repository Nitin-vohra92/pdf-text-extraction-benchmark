High Ratio of 44Ti/56Ni in Cas A and Axisymmetric Collapse-Driven Supernova Explosion

Introduction

Cassiopeia A (Cas A) is a young supernova remnant which is located relatively close to us (2.9  ±  0.1 kpc, [\cite=braun87]). There is an old record that John Flamsteed observed this supernova phenomenon (1680 AD?) and the new star had an apparent brightness of the 6th magnitude ([\cite=ashworth80]). The mass of the progenitor is estimated to be (15-30) [formula] ([\cite=hurford96]), which implies that Cas A is the remnant of collapse-driven supernova explosion.

Recently, Cas A was observed by the COMPTEL telescope aboard the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory and the gamma-ray line (1.157 MeV) from 44Ti decay was detected at the significance level of ~  4σ. The measured line flux was (7.0±  1.7)×  10- 5 photons/cm2/sec ([\cite=iyudin94]). However, this flux measurement was revised to (4.8±  0.9) ×  10- 5 photons/cm2/sec by further analysis ([\cite=iyudin97]). On the other hand, OSSE observations reported that the flux is (1.7±  1.4)×  10- 5 photons/cm2/sec ([\cite=the96]). At the 1 σ level, the revised COMPTEL observation and the OSSE result are in agreement near 3.5×  10- 5 photons/cm2/sec. The inferred amount of 44Ti is larger than 1 [formula], although this estimate depends on the distance and the age of Cas A, and especially, on the half-life of 44Ti which is still very uncertain ( it is difficult to measure half-life of an element of the order of the human life time; we also note that the half-life equals to the lifetime×   log e2, by way of precaution ). It is reported to fall in the range from 39  ±  4 yr ([\cite=meibner96]) to 66.6  ±  1.6 yr ([\cite=alburger90]). This range corresponds to (50-98) yr in the lifetime.

The observed mass of 44Ti in Cas A, 1[formula], is large compared with the theoretical prediction ([\cite=woosley95]; [\cite=timmes96]) even if we adopt the lower limit of the COMPTEL observation. Moreover, this amount of 44Ti is accompanied by the ejection of at least 0.05 [formula] of 56Ni, if we assume that the theoretical prediction for the ratio of mass fractions, X(44Ti) / 56Ni)  ≤  1.89  ×  10- 3, ([\cite=woosley91]) is correct . However, this much 56Ni would have led to the peak absolute magnitude of ~   -4, and would have been much brighter than the recorded 6th magnitude of the apparent brightness. This is the puzzling abundance problem of Cas A.

Although the possibility of extinction of ~   10 mag is proposed to solve this problem ([\cite=timmes96]), it is yet to be confirmed observationally ([\cite=predehl95]). In the present paper, we propose another explanation, that is, the effect of asymmetry of the supernova explosion.

Historically, almost all explosive nucleosynthesis calculations with the use of a large nuclear reaction network have been performed for spherically symmetric explosion models. On the other hand, both the image of Cas A inferred from optical and X-ray observations and the velocity distribution inferred from optial observation show that the remnant is not spherically symmetric. Particularly in optical images, a remarkable jet-like feature is present at the east-side (e.g., [\cite=fesen96]). The fact that no pulsar has been found yet in Cas A might imply that the jet did not originate from the pulsar, but was caused by the core-collapse dynamics, that is, the explosion itself would have been asymmetric (e.g., [\cite=burrows95]).

Recently, Nagataki et al. (1997) calculated for the first time explosive nucleosynthesis in axisymmetrically deformed collapse-driven supernovae using a large nuclear reaction network (see [\cite=bazan97] for 2D nucleosynthesis calculations in the presupernova stages, and refer also to Müller et al. (1991) for explosive nucleosynthesis with the Rayleigh-Taylor instability). They found that the ratio X(44Ti) / 56Ni) can be significantly larger than that of the spherical explosion. The reason is as follows:

Since 44Ti is synthesized through the alpha-rich freezeout, high entropy is needed for the synthesis of this nucleus. The relation between the energy density and the temperature behind the shock wave is approximately [formula], where a is the radiation constant. Since the axisymmetric explosion generates a stronger shock wave in the polar direction, a higher temperature is reached in this direction, resulting in much higher entropy per baryon than that for the spherical explosion. It should be noted again that it is this stronger alpha-rich freezeout that yields the higher ratio of X(44Ti) / 56Ni) for the axisymmetric explosion beyond the constraint ([\cite=woosley91]) for the ratio in the spherical explosions.

In the present paper, we investigate whether the axisymmetric explosion mechanism can explain the mass of 44Ti and the high ratio of X(44Ti) / 56Ni) observed in Cas A. In section [\ref=nucleosynthesis], we summarize the results of Nagataki et al. (1997). Comparison with observations is presented in section [\ref=results]. Summary and discussion are given in section [\ref=summary].

Explosive Nucleosynthesis for Axisymmetric Supernova Explosions

In this section, we summarize the results of Nagataki et al. (1997). They performed 2-dimensional hydrodynamical calculations and studied the changes of the chemical compositions using a large nuclear reaction network containing 242 nuclear species. The location of the mass cut was not determined from the hydrodynamical calculation but from the amount of 56Ni in the ejecta. We note that all material inside the mass cut are assumed to fall back onto the central compact object (this is the definition of the mass cut). For example, the mass cut for the model of SN 1987A was determined so as to contain [formula] of 56Ni in the ejecta , which is the value inferred from the light curve. We show in Figure [\ref=ti44ni56] the relations between the ejected mass of 56Ni and that of 44Ti for four models S1, A1, A2, and A3. Model S1 is a spherical explosion, A1, A2, and A3 are models of axisymmetric explosions in an increasing order of the degree of asymmetry. For the axisymmetric models A1-3 the initial velocity behind the shock wave is assumed to be radial and proportional to [formula], where r, θ, and α are the radius, the zenith angle and the model parameter that determines the degree of asymmetry, respectively. In this study, we take α  =  0 for model S1, [formula] for model A1, [formula] for model A2, and [formula] for model A3. The larger α gets, the more asymmetric the explosion becomes. We assumed the same distribution also for the thermal energy. Half of the total energy appears as kinetic energy and the other half as thermal energy. Once the position of the mass cut is determined, the mass of 44Ti is also obtained for each model as is seen from Figure [\ref=ti44ni56].

Comparison with observations

The amount of 44Ti synthesized in Cas A is estimated from the observed flux by using the following equation which holds if the intervening matter is transparent to the gamma-ray line:

[formula]

where [formula], Fγ, d, M(44Ti), τ, and t are the amount of 44Ti (in solar mass) synthesized in Cas A, the gamma-ray flux, the distance, the mass of 44Ti, the lifetime of 44Ti, and the age of Cas A, respectively.

We show in Figures  [\ref=fig2] and [\ref=fig3] the amount of 44Ti as a function of the lifetime. Since the age of Cas A is uncertain, we study three cases; 300, 315, and 335 yrs ([\cite=vandenbergh83]). We set other parameters so as to be modest for the spherical explosion model. As one can see from the equation [\ref=eqn1], the lowest amount of 44Ti allowed by the observation is obtained by choosing the smallest values for the flux and the distance within the uncertainties. Therefore, we adopt in this paper the lowest flux of the COMPTEL telescope (3.9   ×  10- 5cm- 2s- 1) and the nearest distance (2.8 kpc). We will see that the spherical explosion model can not explain the amount of 44Ti even with these modest parameters.

For comparison, we give the amount of 44Ti ejected from the four models. Since the amount of 56Ni in Cas A is unknown, unlike SN 1987A, we investigate the mass of 44Ti for two mass cuts (M.C (A) and M.C (B) in Figure [\ref=ti44ni56]) to see its effect. In case of M.C.(A), [formula] of 56Ni is ejected and [formula] in M.C.(B). The results are shown in Figures  [\ref=fig2] and  [\ref=fig3] by the horizontal lines.

We can see from these figures the spherical explosion can not produce enough amount of 44Ti even if the youngest age, the nearest distance within uncertainty, and a rather larger amount of 56Ni are used. Therefore, we conclude that the spherically symmetric explosion model is unlikely to explain the 44Ti mass observed in Cas A if the lifetime is shorter than ~   80 years and the intervening matter is transparent to the gamma-ray line. On the other hand, it is shown the axisymmetric models can produce larger amount of 44Ti than the spherical explosion. It should be noted that no spherically symmetric explosion models calculated so far predict more than [formula] of 44Ti in agreement with our model S1 ([\cite=woosley95]; [\cite=hashimoto95]).

Summary and Discussion

We have tried to explain the observation of the large amount of 44Ti and the high ratio of 44Ti / 56Ni in Cas A using the results of the axisymmetric explosive nucleosynthesis by Nagataki et al. (1997). We have found that the spherically symmetric explosion model is unlikely to give an explanation of such a high ratio of 44Ti  /  56Ni if the lifetime of 44Ti is shorter than ~   80 years and the intervening matter is transparent to the gamma-ray line from the decay of 44Ti. Although a large extinction of ~   10 mag due to the intervening matter was proposed as a solution to the problem of the observed low apparent brightness ([\cite=timmes96]), this remainds to be confirmed observationally ([\cite=predehl95]). Instead, we based our model on the observational fact that the shape of Cas A is far from spherically symmetric (e.g., [\cite=fesen96]), and we found by 2D calculations that the axisymmetric explosion models can also solve this problem. We think it is qualitatively correct that the ratio of 44Ti  /  56Ni is enhanced by axisymmetric explosion, since larger energy is deposited near the rotational axis and higher entropy per baryon is reached there, resulting in stronger alpha-rich freezeout and yielding the larger amount of 44Ti and higher ratio of 44Ti  /  56Ni. Quantitatively, however, there are uncertainties in the location of mass cut as well as in the initial degree of asymmetry, both of which are difficult to derive from analytical studies or numerical simulations, at least at present. In spite of these quantitative difficulties, we believe it is worthwhile for our scenario to be studied further, since it results in a solution to the Cas A problem.

In this paper we used only one progenitor model, where the He core mass is 6 [formula], which corresponds to 18-21 [formula] in the main-sequence stage. Since the progenitor of Cas A is thought to be 15-30 [formula], one may need to examine the dependence of our conclusion on the progenitor mass. However, we think the qualitative tendency for the ratio of 44Ti / 56Ni will not be changed for the following reason. The entropy per baryon after the passage of the shock wave is approximately proportional to T3  /  ρ, where T and ρ are the local temperature and density. This means the entropy per baryon depends more strongly on the temperature than on the density. The temperature depends significantly on the strength of the initial shock wave while the density depends on the initial structure of the progenitor. Since the iron cores of the presupernova models have similar structures ([\cite=hashimoto95]), the qualitative tendency for the ratio of 44Ti / 56Ni will be unchanged even if the mass of the progenitor is changed.

The essential point of our results is that the explosion energy is localized in a small region near the rotation axis , leading to the stronger alpha-rich freezeout there. Therefore, we expect that the same mechanism will also work for three dimensionally asymmetric explosions, where the explosion energy is deposited in some small regions.

There are two main possibilities conceivable that make the shock wave asymmetric in the collapse-driven supernova explosion. One is the effect of rotation (and/or magnetic field) of the progenitor, which causes the shock wave axisymmetry ([\cite=muller81]; [\cite=symbalisty84]; [\cite=mochmeyer89]; [\cite=yamada94]). The other is the effect of neutrino-driven convection ([\cite=shimizu94]; [\cite=burrows95]) which causes high-speed "fingers" in the mantle , resulting in a more complex asymmetric explosion.

Although in this paper and in Nagataki et al. (1997), we have shown the effect of the strong alpha-rich freezeout for the 2D axisymmetric explosion, we also want to stress the necessity of explosive nucleosynthesis calculations with a large nuclear reaction network for the "finger-like" explosion. Although it requires very high mesh resolution and CPU-time, we think such a calculation will be necessary to explain the observed complex structure of Cas A . We are planning such a calculation in the near future.
