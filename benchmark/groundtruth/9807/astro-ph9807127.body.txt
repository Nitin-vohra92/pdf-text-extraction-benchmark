Overview

Using a multi-plane lensing method that we have developed (Premadi, Martel, & Matzner 1998), we follow the evolution of light beams as they propagate through inhomogeneous universes. We use a P3M code to simulate the formation and evolution of large-scale structure. The resolution of the simulations is increased to sub-Megaparsec scales by using a Monte Carlo method to locate galaxies inside the computational volume according to the underlying particle distribution.

We consider cold dark matter models normalized to COBE, and perform a large parameter survey by varying the cosmological parameters Ω0, λ0, H0, and n (the tilt of the primordial power spectrum). This parameter survey is still in progress. Table 1 gives the values of the parameters for the models we have studied so far.

The Ray Shooting Experiments

For each model, we perform numerous ray-tracing experiments, propagating beams of 312 light rays back in time up to redshifts z = 3 or 5. From the results of these experiments, we build statistics of the shear and magnification of sources, as well as the properties of images. In Figure 1, we plot the images of distant circular sources, to illustrate interesting cases that occurred in some experiments: magnification and shear (Fig. 1a), double image (Fig. 1b), Einstein ring (Fig. 1c), and triple image (Fig. 1d).
