Introduction. It was suggested long ago [\cite=oldatmos] that the atmospheric neutrino anomaly [\cite=atmos] could be explained by the oscillation of muon neutrinos and antineutrinos into another neutrino species. This interpretation has been confirmed by the zenith angle dependence measured by the Super-Kamiokande (SuperK) experiment [\cite=SuperK]. Neutrino oscillations can also be invoked to separately explain the solar neutrino deficit [\cite=solar] [\cite=newsolar] and the results of the LSND experiment [\cite=LSND]. Because confirmation of the LSND results awaits future experiments and recent measurements in the KARMEN detector exclude part of the LSND allowed region [\cite=LSNDconfirm], a conservative approach is to assume that oscillations need only account for the solar and atmospheric data. Then the two mass-squared difference scales in a three-neutrino model are sufficient to describe the data. Interest in the implications for models of the atmospheric neutrino anomaly has recently intensified [\cite=newatmos] [\cite=bpww] [\cite=maxosc]. An attractive possibility is that both the atmospheric νμ and solar νe oscillate maximally or near-maximally at the δm2atm and δm2sun scales, respectively [\cite=bpww] [\cite=maxosc].

In this letter we use the recent Super-Kamiokande atmospheric neutrino data [\cite=SuperK] to determine the allowed values for the general three-neutrino mixing matrix under the assumption that one mass-squared difference, δm2atm, explains the atmospheric neutrino oscillations. In our scenario the other mass-squared difference, δm2sun  ≪  δm2atm, can explain the solar neutrino oscillations via either an MSW [\cite=MSW] or vacuum long-wavelength scenario [\cite=vlw]. We find that although pure νμ  →  ντ oscillations of atmospheric neutrinos are favored, there exist three-neutrino solutions with non-negligible νμ  ↔  νe oscillations, even after applying the constraints from the CHOOZ reactor experiment [\cite=CHOOZ]. Consequently νμ  ↔  νe and νe  →  ντ oscillations may be observable in future long-baseline experiments.

Oscillation probabilities. We begin our analysis with the survival probability for a given neutrino flavor in a vacuum [\cite=VBreal]

[formula]

where

[formula]

U is the neutrino mixing matrix (in the basis where the charged-lepton mass matrix is diagonal), [formula], [formula], and the sum is over all j and k, subject to k < j. The matrix elements Uαj are the mixings between the flavor (α = e,μ,τ) and the mass (j = 1,2,3) eigenstates, and we assume without loss of generality that m1  <  m2  <  m3. The solar oscillations are driven by [formula] and the atmospheric oscillations are driven by [formula].

The off-diagonal vacuum oscillation probabilities of this three-neutrino model are

[formula]

where the CP-violating "Jarlskog invariant" [\cite=jarlskog] is [formula] for any α, β, i, and j (e.g., J  =  Im{Ue2U*e3U*μ2Uμ3} for α = e, β  =  μ, i = 2, and j = 3). The CP-odd term changes sign under reversal of the oscillating flavors. We note that the CP-violating probability at the atmospheric scale is suppressed to order δm2sun  /  δm2atm, the leading term having cancelled in the sum over the two light-mass states; thus, P(να  →  νβ)  =  P(νβ  →  να) at the atmospheric scale.

Fit to atmospheric neutrino data. For the L / E values of the atmospheric and long-baseline experiments, Δsun can be neglected, and the vacuum oscillation probabilities become simply

[formula]

In Eqs. ([\ref=petau2]) and ([\ref=pmutau2]) we have used the unitarity condition Pτ3  =  1  -  Pe3  -  Pμ3. Thus for oscillations at the atmospheric scale there are only two independent mixing matrix parameters, e.g., Pe3 and Pμ3, that are relevant. All predictions for atmospheric and long-baseline experiments are completely determined by the three parameters δm2atm, Pe3, and Pμ3. We define the oscillation amplitudes [formula], [formula], Aμeatm, Aeτatm, and Aμτatm, as the coefficients of the sin 2Δatm terms in Eqs. ([\ref=pmumu2])-([\ref=pmutau2]), respectively. The parameters Pe3 and [formula] can then be determined from the atmospheric neutrino data by the relations

[formula]

and

[formula]

where Noe and Noμ are the expected numbers of atmospheric e and μ events, respectively, [formula], [formula] is sin 2Δatm appropriately averaged, and α is the overall neutrino flux normalization, which we allow to vary following the SuperK analysis [\cite=SuperK]. SuperK reports Nμ / Noμ and Ne / Noe from a 535 day exposure for eight different L / E bins [\cite=SuperK]. The data were obtained by inferring an L / E value for each event from the zenith angle [formula] and energy of the observed charged lepton [formula] and comparing it to expectations from a monte carlo simulation based on the atmospheric neutrino spectrum [\cite=flux] folded with the differential cross section.

Due to the fact that the charged lepton energy and direction in general differ from the corresponding values for the incident neutrino (or antineutrino), the L / E distribution involves substantial smearing. We estimate this smearing by a monte carlo integration over the neutrino angle and energy spectrum [\cite=stanevflux] weighted by the differential cross section. We generate events with Eν and θν, and determine the corresponding [formula] and [formula] for the charged lepton. We bin the events in L / Eν, using [formula] to determine L and an estimated neutrino energy inferred from the average ratio of lepton momentum to neutrino energy, [formula], analogous to the SuperK analysis [\cite=SuperK]. We then calculate a value for [formula] for each L / E bin for a given value of δm2atm. Finally we make a fit to Eqs. ([\ref=Rmu]) and ([\ref=Re]) to determine Pe3, [formula], δm2atm, and α [\cite=bilenky]. Without loss of generality we take δm2atm to be positive.

Our best fit values for the four parameters are

[formula]

with χ2min = 7.1 for 12 degrees of freedom. This best fit is close to the result of the SuperK simulation that assumed only two-neutrino oscillations. In Fig. 1a we show the allowed region for Pμ3 versus Pe3 for α = 1.16 and [formula] eV2. Although Pe3 = 0 is favored, small nonzero values are allowed, which permit some νμ  ↔  νe and νe  →  ντ oscillations of atmospheric neutrinos. In Fig. 1b we show the allowed region for the overall flux normalization α versus δm2atm for Pe3 = 0 and Pμ3 = 0.50.

Another limit on Pe3 comes from the CHOOZ reactor experiment [\cite=CHOOZ] that measures e disappearance

[formula]

which applies for [formula] eV2. The exact limit on [formula] varies with δm2atm, and for δm2atm  <  10- 3 eV2 there is no limit at all. For [formula] eV2 and α = 1.16, Pe3 is constrained to be less than 0.04. The result of this additional constraint is shown in Fig. 1a. In Fig. 1c we show the effect of the CHOOZ constraint on the allowed region of Pe3 versus δm2atm for α = 1.16 and Pμ3 = 0.50.

Varying over the entire parameter space, and imposing the CHOOZ constraint, the ranges of allowed values at 68% (95%) C.L. are

[formula]

The allowed ranges of some related oscillation parameters are

[formula]

Although νμ  →  μτ oscillations are strongly favored, νμ  ↔  νe are allowed with amplitude as large as 0.18.

We do not consider matter effects in the above analysis. For the δm2atm favored by our fit, matter effects are small for the sub-GeV neutrinos that constitute most of the data. Also, as evidenced by our fit, the dominant oscillation is νμ  →  ντ, which is not affected by matter. However, matter effects could be important for neutrinos with smaller δm2atm / E, i.e., especially for multi-GeV data in solutions with [formula], which could be observable as more data becomes available at higher energies.

New physics predictions. The new physics predicted when Pe3  ≠  0 is νe  →  ντ oscillations with leading probability (i.e., the Δatm terms) given by Eq. ([\ref=petau2]). From Eq. ([\ref=aetaurange]) the maximal amplitude Aeτatm for these oscillations is 0.16 at 95% C.L. Figure 2 shows the allowed values of Aeτatm versus Aμeatm for [formula] eV2 and α = 1.16; the effect of the CHOOZ constraint is also shown. The νe  →  ντ oscillations could be observed by long-baseline neutrino experiments with proposed high intensity muon sources [\cite=geer] [\cite=bww97] [\cite=bpww2], which can also make precise measurements of νμ  ↔  νe and νμ  →  ντ oscillations. Sensitivity to [formula] is expected [\cite=geer] for the parameter ranges of interest here; for [formula] eV2, Aeτatm could be measured down to [formula]. The measurement of νe  →  ντ and νμ  ↔  νe oscillations in such a long-baseline experiment would test the three-neutrino model.

Discussion. Further measurements of atmospheric neutrinos will more precisely determine the parameters Pe3, Pμ3, and δm2atm. The MINOS [\cite=MINOS], K2K [\cite=K2K], and ICARUS [\cite=ICARUS] experiments are expected to test for νμ  →  νe and νμ  →  ντ oscillations for δm2atm  >  10- 3 eV2. Together these measurements could put strong limits on Pe3, which governs the νe  →  ντ oscillations that could be seen in future long-baseline experiments such as those utilizing a muon storage ring at Fermilab [\cite=geer]. Full three-neutrino fits including the solar neutrino data [\cite=osland] can then determine one of the remaining two independent parameters in the mixing matrix, e.g., Pe1, using the νe survival probability for [formula]

[formula]

The considerations in this paper can also be extended to a four-neutrino model [\cite=bpww2].
