ABSTRACT

We construct a new (singular) cohomogeneity-three metric of G2 holonomy. The solution can be viewed as a triple intersection of smeared Taub-NUTs. The metric comprises three non-compact radial-type coordinates, with the principal orbits being a T3 bundle over S1. We consider an M-theory vacuum (Minkowski)4  ×  M7 where M7 is the G2 manifold. Upon reduction on a circle in the T3, we obtain the intersection of a D6-brane, a Taub-NUT and a 6-brane with R-R 2-form flux. Reducing the solution instead on the base space S1, we obtain three intersecting 6-branes all carrying R-R 2-form flux. These two configurations can be viewed as a classical flop in the type IIA string theory. After reducing on the full principal orbits and the spatial world-volume, we obtain a four-dimensional metric describing a lattice universe, in which the three non-compact coordinates of the G2 manifold are identified with the spatial coordinates of our universe.

Introduction

Seven-dimensional manifolds of G2 holonomy have long been known to exist. The construction of explicit non-compact G2 metrics began ten years ago, when asymptotically conical metrics of cohomogeneity one were found [\cite=brysal] [\cite=gibpagpop]. The physical interest of G2 manifolds has increasingly significantly with the discovery of M-theory, because they are the most natural compactifying spaces from the eleven-dimensional point of view. It is expected that M-theory compactified on a G2 manifold gives rise to an N = 1 super Yang-Mills theory in D = 4 [\cite=acharaya]. The G2 manifold with principal orbits S3  ×  S3 provides a geometrical demonstration of the classical flop of the type IIA superstring theory [\cite=atmava]. In [\cite=atiwit], M-theory dynamics on a G2 manifold were discussed.

Recently, a large class of new metrics of G2 holonomy have been obtained [\cite=cglp6fun]-[\cite=ccglpw], following the construction of the first examples of asymptotically locally conical spin(7) manifolds [\cite=newspin7]. These examples have non-abelian isometry groups. G2 metrics with nilpotent isometry groups were also constructed in [\cite=gilupost], which can be obtained by taking the Heisenberg or Euclidean limits of the non-abelian examples. Whilst it is of great interest to construct regular G2 metrics, physically, it is essential to have an appropriate singularity structure to give rise to chiral fermions in D = 4 [\cite=achwit] [\cite=csu].

In section 2, we construct a new non-compact cohomogeneity three metric with G2 holonomy. The metric has three non-compact radial-type coordinates, with the principal orbits being a T3 bundle over S1. The isometry group of the metric is a four-dimensional nilpotent Lie group. The metric has either power-law singularities or delta-function singularities. The solution can be viewed as the intersection of three smeared Taub-NUTs. When one of the Taub-NUT charges is set to zero, the metric describes a product of S1 with a six-dimensional non-compact Calabi-Yau manifold.

In section 3, we consider an M-theory vacuum (Minkowski)4  ×  M7, where M7 is the G2 manifold. We show that by dimensionally reducing the solution on one of the circles in the T3, we obtain a type IIA configuration with one D6-brane, one Taub-NUT and one 6-brane with an R-R 2-form flux. On the other hand, if we reduce the solution on the base space S1, we obtain an intersection of three 6-branes all carrying R-R 2-form flux. These two configurations can be viewed as the classical flop in type IIA string theory on a non-compact six-dimensional Kähler manifold with a nilpotent isometry group. The origin of the flop is that the T3 bundle over S1 principal orbits can also be viewed as S1 bundle over T3.

In section 4, we perform a Kaluza-Klein reduction on the full principal orbits and the spatial world-volume. We obtain three perpendicularly intersecting membranes in D = 4, describing a lattice universe. In this picture, the three non-compact coordinates of the G2 manifold are identified with the spatial coordinates of our universe. We conclude the letter in section 5.

New G2 metric

The metric ansatz is given by

[formula]

where H1, H2 and H3 are functions of x1, x2 and x3 respectively. The prime on Hi' denotes a derivative with respect to the argument of Hi;

[formula]

The natural vielbein basis is

[formula]

The associative 3-form in this basis is given by

[formula]

where [formula]. The metric ([\ref=g2metric]) has G2 holonomy if and only if Φ is closed and co-closed. We find that the closure and co-closure of Φ implies that

[formula]

implying that

[formula]

Here the constant 1 is included so that Hi does not vanish when mi = 0. Clearly the metric has a power-law singularity whenever any of the Hi vanishes. The metric can also be recast in a "co-moving" frame,

[formula]

The fibration in the z1, z2 and z3 coordinates implies that the constants mi are quantised, namely [\cite=fibre]

[formula]

where ni are integers and Li are the periods of the zi. For simplicity, we can set [formula] where [formula] is the Plank length, and then [formula].

The metric has a power-law singularity when any of the Hi vanishes. This can be avoided by instead taking

[formula]

such that Hi is positive definite. However, in doing so, we have introduced delta function singularities.

When all three of the Hi' are non-vanishing, the metric describes three intersecting Taub-NUTs with three independent non-vanishing smeared charges. The metric has three non-compact coordinates x1, x2 and x3. The principal orbits are T3 bundle over S1; they are parameterised by the coordinates (z1,z2,z3) and z4 respectively. The metric is of cohomogeneity three since it depends explicitly on the three non-compact coordinates xi. Despite the dependence on the (z1,z2,z3) coordinates, they, together with z4, parameterise a four-dimensional nilpotent Lie group G, which is the isometry group of the metric, and thus the four-dimensional principal orbits are homogeneous.

When two of the Hi' vanish, the metric describes a direct product of Euclidean 3-space and a smeared Taub-NUT. if instead only one of Hi' vanishes, in which case the metric was obtained in [\cite=lattice], it describes a product of an S1 with a Calabi-Yau 6-manifold. To see this in detail, let us set H3 = 1. The metric of the Calabi-Yau manifold is then given by

[formula]

and the Kähler form is given by

[formula]

where the vielbein is given by ([\ref=vielbein]) with H3 = 1.

Intersecting D6-branes

Having obtained the new G2 metric, one may consider an M-theory vacuum solution given by the direct product of Minkowski 4-spacetime and the G2 manifold, namely

[formula]

The solution can be viewed as a triple intersection of smeared Taub-NUTs, with the metric represented by the diagram

Diagram 1. Triple intersections of Taub-NUTs. Here ×  , -   and *   denote

the world-volume, transverse space, and fibre coordinates respectively.

There is a U(1) isometry for each of the zi coordinates, and so we can reduce the metric on any zi to obtain a solution in type IIA theory. The zi for i = 1,2,3 are equivalent, and hence the reduction can be discussed using z1 as a representative. The resulting type IIA solution is given by

[formula]

Note that before performing the Kaluza-Klein reduction, we have made a coordinate transformation z3  →  z3  -  H3'  z1  z4 in the metric ([\ref=g2metric]). Clearly, the solution describes an intersection of three objects. The one parameterised by H1 is a smeared D6-brane, and the one parameterised by H2 is a Taub-NUT. The one associated with H3 is a 6-brane carrying an R-R 2-form flux, but it differs from a standard D6-brane.

We can instead reduce the solution on the z4 coordinate, giving the type IIA solution

[formula]

The solution describes three intersecting 6-branes all carrying R-R 2-form flux. These 6-branes are different from the usual D6-brane coming from the reduction of the fibre coordinate of a Taub-NUT in D = 11.

The two configurations arising from the reduction on z1 or z4 can be viewed as a classical flop in the type IIA string theory on the non-compact Kähler manifold. The flop in D = 10 can be geometrically explained by the fact that the T3 bundle over S1 principal orbits of the four-dimensional nilpotent Lie group G can also be described as an S1 bundle over T3. However, the two descriptions are somewhat different. In the latter case, the fibre is the circle group in G generated by [formula]. In the former case, the fibre is not the orbit of a three-dimensional subgroup of G because [formula] for i = 1,2,3 are not themselves Killing vectors; we must add a multiple of [formula]. In fact the flop involves interchanging the fibre and base spaces of the U(1) fibration. This is analogous to the flop discussed in [\cite=atmava].

Lattice universe

The new G2 metric ([\ref=g2metric]) that we have obtained is in fact inspired by the four-dimensional intersecting membrane solution that describes the lattice universe [\cite=lattice]. There has been experimental evidence suggesting that the network of galaxy superclusters and voids seems to form a three-dimensional lattice with a spacing of about 120h- 1    Mpc (where h- 1 is the Hubble constant in units of 100km    s- 1    Mpc- 1) [\cite=lattice1] [\cite=lattice2] [\cite=lattice3]. In [\cite=lattice], an M-theory solution was constructed to describe such a lattice structure, which can be realised by considering non-standard brane intersections of two M5-branes and one Taub-NUT, or two Taub-NUTs and one M5-brane. In the latter case, turning off the M5-brane charge causes the solution to reduce to the product of 5-dimensional Minkowski spacetime and the non-compact Calabi-Yau manifold given in ([\ref=d6metric]).

In section 2, we obtained the new G2 metric ([\ref=g2metric]) by adding an extra fibration on the seventh coordinate. This procedure follows the general prescription of obtaining G2 manifolds from six-dimensional Kähler manifolds, described in detail in [\cite=almost].

If we reduce the M-theory solution on the world-volume spatial coordinates wi and also on the T3 bundle over S1 principal orbits, we obtain three perpendicularly intersecting membranes in D = 4, with the metric

[formula]

This metric was first obtained in [\cite=lattice], although it was supported by very different field strength. The functions of Hi in this case are given by ([\ref=sol2]) describing periodic arrays of intersecting membranes.

In this static cosmological model the spatial world-volume and the T3 bundle over S1 principal orbits are viewed as an internal space, whilst the three non-compact coordinates x1, x2 and x3 of the G2 manifold are identified with the spatial coordinates of our universe. This is rather natural since the principal orbits are clearly compact, and the spatial world-volume can be wrapped on a compact space such as T3. Although it is not likely that the metric ([\ref=lattice]) describes our actual universe, since it preserves N = 1 supersymmetry; it is nevertheless rather suggestive that the lattice structure should emerge from a metric with G2 holonomy.

Conclusions

In this letter, we constructed a new cohomogeneity-three metric with G2 holonomy. It has three radial-type coordinates, with the principle orbits being a T3 bundle over S1. The solution can be viewed as three intersecting Taub-NUTs. We performed Kaluza-Klein reduction on the S1 and instead on a circle in the T3. The two resulting type IIA configurations can be viewed as a classical flop in type IIA string theory on a non-compact Kähler six-manifold. Although the type IIA solutions do not describe the triply intersecting D6-branes advocated in [\cite=csu] [\cite=wit] for the realisation of chiral fermions, it is nevertheless of interest to investigate further if chirality could arise from the singularities of our G2 metric. The metric provides a concrete example for studying such an issue, since it can be viewed as the lifting of a D6-brane configurations in D = 10.

If we perform a Kaluza-Klein reduction on the entire four-dimensional full principal orbits and the spatial world-volume, we obtain triply intersecting membranes in D = 4, describing a lattice universe. The construction takes full advantage of the non-compact nature of the manifold, in that the three non-compact coordinates are precisely identified with the spatial coordinates of our universe. It is of great interest to investigate further the significance of such a configuration arising from a G2 manifold.
