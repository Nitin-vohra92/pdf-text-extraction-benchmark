Successive Minima and Lattice Points

Introduction

In 1896 Hermann Minkowski's fundamental and guiding book "Geometrie der Zahlen" [\cite=Min:geozahl] was published, which may be considered as the first systematic study on relations between convex geometry, Diophantine approximation, and the theory of quadratic forms (cf.  Gruber [\cite=Gru:geonum]). One of the basic problems in geometry of numbers is to decide whether a given set in the d-dimensional Euclidean space [formula] contains a non-trivial lattice point of a d-dimensional lattice [formula]. With respect to the class Kd0 of all 0-symmetric convex bodies in [formula] with non-empty interior and the volume [formula] - d-dimensional Lebesgue measure - Minkowski settled this problem:

[formula]

Here det Λ denotes the determinant of the lattice Λ and the space of all lattices [formula] with det Λ  ≠  0 is denoted by Ld.

Minkowski assessed his result as "ein Satz, der nach meinem Dafürhalten zu den fruchtbarsten in der Zahlenlehre zu rechnen ist" ([\cite=Min:geozahl], p. 75) and indeed this theorem has many applications (cf. [\cite=ErdGruHam:lattpoint], sec. 3.3). Minkowski proved even a stronger result, for which we have to introduce his "kleinstes System von unabhängig gerichteten Strahlendistanzen im Zahlengitter" ([\cite=Min:geozahl], p. 178).

Let K∈Kd0 and Λ∈Ld. For 1  ≤  i  ≤  d is called the i-th successive minimum of K with respect to Λ.

Obviously, we have [formula] and the first successive minimum λ1(K,Λ) is the smallest dilation factor such that λ1(K,Λ)  K contains a non-zero lattice point. With this notation Minkowski's first theorem on successive minima reads (cf. [\cite=Min:geozahl], pp. 75)

Let K in Kd0 and Λ∈Ld. Then

So [formula] implies λ1(K,Λ)  ≤  1, and we get [\eqref=eq:minkowski0]. Minkowski's second theorem on successive minima is a deep improvement of the first one and says (cf. [\cite=Min:geozahl], pp. 199)

Let K∈Kd0 and Λ∈Ld. Then

This inequality is best possible. For instance, with respect to the integral lattice [formula], each box with axes parallel to the coordinate axes gives equality. Although Theorem [\ref=thm:Minkowski_second] has not so many applications as the first theorem on successive minima, it shows a beautiful relation between the volume of K and the expansion of K with respect to independent lattice directions of a lattice. The importance of Theorem [\ref=thm:Minkowski_second] is also reflected in the number of different proofs, see e.g.  Bambah, Woods & Zassenhaus [\cite=BamWooZas:succmin], Cassels [\cite=Cas:geonum], Danicic [\cite=Dan:succmin], Davenport [\cite=Dav:succmin], Estermann [\cite=Est:succmin], Siegel [\cite=Sie:geonum] and Weyl [\cite=Wey:succmin].

In [\cite=BetkeHenkWills:successive_minima] it was conjectured that an inequality analogue to Theorem [\ref=thm:Minkowski_second] holds for the lattice point enumerator [formula]. More precisely,

Let K∈Kd0 and Λ∈Ld. Then

[formula]

Here ⌊x⌋ denotes the smallest integer not less than x. An analogous statement to the first theorem of Minkowski on successive minima was already shown in [\cite=BetkeHenkWills:successive_minima], namely

[formula]

It seems to be worth mentioning that if Conjecture [\ref=conj:bhw] were true then we could write by the definition of the Riemann integral Thus Conjecture [\ref=conj:bhw] implies Minkowski's second theorem on successive minima (Theorem [\ref=thm:Minkowski_second]). In [\cite=BetkeHenkWills:successive_minima] the validity of the conjecture was proven in the case d = 2. Moreover, it was shown that an upper bound of this type exists, if in the above product [formula] is replaced by [formula]. So, roughly speaking, [\eqref=eq:conj] holds up to a factor d!. Here we shall improve this bound.

Let d  ≥  2, K∈Kd0 and Λ∈Ld. Then

The proof of this theorem will be given is the next section. Minkowski's original proof ([\cite=Min:geozahl], 199-218) of his second theorem on successive minima was sometimes criticised as lengthy and obscure (cf. [\cite=davenport:collected_mink], p.91). One reason might be that in the scope of the proof he also proves many basic facts about the volume of a convex body, like the computation of the volume through successive integrations, etc., which cloud a little bit the simple and nice geometrical ideas of his proof. Based on these ideas we present a short proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:Minkowski_second] in the last section.

For more information on lattices, successive minima and their role in the geometry of numbers we refer to the books of Erdös, Gruber and Hammer [\cite=ErdGruHam:lattpoint], Gruber and Lekkerkerker [\cite=GruLek:geonum] and the survey of Gruber [\cite=Gru:geonum]. For an elementary introduction to the geometry of numbers see [\cite=OldsLaxDavidoff:geometry_of_numbers].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:main]

Before giving the proof we list some basic facts on lattices, for which we refer to [\cite=GruLek:geonum]. Every lattice Λ∈Ld can be written as [formula], where A is a non-singular (d  ×  d)-matrix, i.e., [formula]. In particular we have [formula] and [formula]. A lattice [formula] is called a sublattice of Λ∈Ld if [formula]. For [formula] and a sublattice [formula] we write

[formula]

In words, [formula] belong to the same residue class (coset) of Λ with respect to [formula]. We note that there are precisely [formula] different residue classes of Λ with respect to [formula]. For every set of d-linearly independent lattice points [formula] of a lattice Λ there exists a basis [formula] of Λ such that [formula], where [formula] denotes the linear hull. In particular, given d linearly independent lattice vectors [formula], 1  ≤  i  ≤  d, with [formula] then there exists an unimodular matrix U, i.e., [formula], such that

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the i-th unit vector. Furthermore we note that for d linearly independent lattice points [formula] of a lattice Λ∈Ld satisfying ai∈λi(K,Λ)  K, the definition of the successive minima implies

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the interior.

For the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:main] we need the following simple lemma.

Let K∈Kd0, Λ∈Ld and let [formula] be a sublattice of Λ. Then

[formula]

Let [formula] and suppose there exist at least m + 1 different lattice points [formula] such that [formula], 1  ≤  i  ≤  m + 1. Then we have

[formula]

which contradicts the assumption [formula]. Thus we have shown that every residue class of Λ with respect to [formula] does not contain more than m points of [formula]. Since there are precisely [formula] different residue classes, we get the desired bound.

We remark that inequality [\eqref=eq:lat_min_one] is a simple consequence of this lemma. To see this we set n1  =  ⌊2 / λ1(K,Λ) + 1⌋ and [formula]. Next we observe that [formula] implies that [formula] and from [\eqref=eq:succ_cons] we conclude [formula]. Thus Lemma [\ref=lem:lat_suc] gives Next we come to the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:main].

W.l.o.g. let [formula] and we may assume that (cf. [\eqref=eq:succ_minima] and [\eqref=eq:succ_cons])

[formula]

For abbreviation we set [formula], 1  ≤  i  ≤  d, and first we determine d numbers [formula] such that

[formula]

Suppose we have already found [formula] with these properties. In order to determine nk we distinguish two cases. If nk + 1  ≥  qk we set nk = nk + 1. Since qk  ≥  qk + 1 we obtain qk  ≤  nk = nk + 1 < 2  qk + 1  ≤  2  qk. Otherwise, if nk + 1 < qk let qk = m  ·  nk + 1 + r with [formula], m  ≥  1, and 0  ≤  r < nk + 1. In this case we set nk = qk + nk + 1 - r and obviously, nk meets the requirements of [\eqref=eq:proof_numbers].

Now let [formula] be the lattice generated by the vectors [formula]. Then we have [formula] and together with the upper bounds on the the numbers ni, Lemma [\ref=lem:lat_suc] gives

[formula]

Hence, in order to verify the theorem, it suffices to show [formula]. Suppose there exists a [formula] and let k be the largest index of a non-zero coordinate of g, i.e., gk  ≠  0 and [formula]. Then we may write

[formula]

for some [formula]. Since nk is a divisor of [formula] and since [formula] (cf. [\eqref=eq:proof_numbers]) we obtain

[formula]

However, since gk  ≠  0 this relation violates [\eqref=eq:proof_assum]. Thus we have [formula] and the theorem is proven.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:Minkowski_second]

Minkowski's proof of his second theorem on successive minima can be found in his book "Geometrie der Zahlen" ([\cite=Min:geozahl], 199-219) and for an English translation we refer to [\cite=hancock:geonum], 570-603.

Again w.l.o.g. we may assume that [formula]. For convenience we write [formula] and set [formula]. Furthermore, we assume that [formula] are d linearly independent lattice points with [formula] and [formula], 1  ≤  i  ≤  d, (cf. [\eqref=eq:succ_minima]). For short, we denote the linear space [formula] by Li.

For an integer [formula] let [formula] and for 1  ≤  j  ≤  d - 1 let [formula]. Since K is a bounded set there exists a constant γ, only depending on K, such that

[formula]

By the definition of λ1 we have [formula] for two different lattice point [formula], because otherwise we would get the contradiction [formula]. Thus we have

[formula]

In the following we shall show that for 1  ≤  i  ≤  d - 1

[formula]

To this end we may assume λi + 1  >  λi and let [formula], which differ in the last d - i coordinates, i.e., [formula]. Then

[formula]

Otherwise the i + 1 linearly independent lattice points [formula] belong to the interior of λi + 1K which contradicts the minimality of λi + 1. Hence we obtain from [\eqref=eq:cut] and in order to verify [\eqref=eq:second_three] it suffices to show

[formula]

Let [formula] be the linear maps given by

[formula]

Since Miq + Ki + 1 = f2(Miq + f1(Ki)) we get

[formula]

and for the proof of [\eqref=eq:second_five] we have to show

[formula]

To this end let [formula] be the (d - i)-dimensional orthogonal complement of Li. Then it is easy to see that for every [formula] there exists a t(x)∈Li with [formula] and so

[formula]

Thus we get

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the i-dimensional volume. This shows [\eqref=eq:second_six] and so we have verified [\eqref=eq:second_three]. Finally, it follows from [\eqref=eq:second_one], [\eqref=eq:second_two] and [\eqref=eq:second_three] and so

[formula]

Since this holds for all [formula] the theorem is proven.
