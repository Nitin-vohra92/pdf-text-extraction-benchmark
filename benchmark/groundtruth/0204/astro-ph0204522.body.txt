The dynamics of clusters of galaxies suggests the presence of a large amount of dark matter [\cite=kent]. The mass-luminosity ratio for these systems, which may take values of the order of 200 in solar unities, implies that the fraction density of dark matter is such that Ωdm  ~  0.3. On the other hand, cosmological data coming, for example, from the position of the first accoustic peak in the spectrum of the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation, suggests that the universe is almost spatially flat [\cite=charles]. Hence, about 70% of the matter content of the universe remain a smooth unclustered matter component since it does not appear in the dynamics of clusters of galaxies. This smooth component is generally called "dark energy".

A fluid of negative pressure is generally evoked to represent the dark energy of the universe. The cosmological constant is a particular case, characterized by p  =    -  ρ. When the negative pressure is dynamically generated by a self-interacting scalar field, this component is popularly called "quintessence" [\cite=steinhardt]. The behaviour of fluctuations in fluids with negative pressure, in the hydrodynamic representation, was investigate in [\cite=jerome], where it has been showed that there are only decreasing modes in the long wavelength approximation. This fact justifies the using of fluids of negative pressures to represent the smooth component of the matter content of the universe.

In this brief note we reanalyze the fate of density perturbations in fluids with negative pressure. However, in order to keep the model closer to a realistic one, a two-fluid system is studied. Notice that since Ωdm  ~  0.3 and Ωde  ~  0.7, the universe today has not a component that dominates completly the background. One of the components is a pressurelles fluid which is censed to represent dark matter; the other is a fluid described by the barotropic equation of state p  =  αρ, with α  <  0, representing the dark energy. In the present approach both fluids fluctuates, what is the more general case from both the physical and mathematical points of view. In many studies in the literature on this subject(see for example [\cite=lokas]), only the dark matter component is perturbed, since it is assumed that the other component remains unclustered, an assumption justified by the behaviour of the one-fluid model for fluids with negative pressure.

Here, it will be shown that, at least at very large scales, the fluid of negative pressure also clusters. Using numerical integration, it is possible to verify that the clustering of the negative pressure fluid occurs for scales smaller than the Hubble radius. If a smooth component is necessary at scales up to Hubble radius, only the cosmological constant is a serious candidate. Another possibility, as it will be discussed later, is the Chaplygin gas, a very particular fluid with negative pressure.

Let us consider the Einstein's equations in presence of two fluids which do not interact between themselves, but only through geometry. One of the fluid has no pressure and the other has the general equation of state p  =  αρ. Using the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker flat metric, we obtain the equation governing the evolution of the universe:

[formula]

where Ωm0 and Ωq0 represents the fraction density of each of these components today with respect to the total density.

From ([\ref=fe]), we may write

[formula]

In this expression, we have parametrize the time in terms of the Hubble time H- 10, and used the fact that [formula], ρT0 being the total density of the universe today. Using standard techniques [\cite=weinberg] [\cite=peebles] [\cite=turner], the Einstein's equations are perturbed and only the scalar sector is considered since it is directly connected with density perturbations. In the synchronous coordinate condition, the perturbed equations reduce to

[formula]

In these equations Δm and Δq are the density contrast for ordinary matter and the dark energy respectivelly, [formula]. The divergence of the perturbation in the four-velocity of the dark energy fluid was denoted by Θ, and k is the wavenumber of the perturbation. The primes mean derivative with respect to the scale factor a. In deriving ([\ref=pe1],[\ref=pe2],[\ref=pe3]) it has been used the fact that [formula], where h is the trace of metric perturbations, a relation coming from the equation of conservation for the pressurelles fluid.

Strictly speaking, if one has in mind a kind of quintessence scenario, a self-interacting scalar field should be considered instead of a hydrodynamical fluid with negative pressure. But, as it was discussed in [\cite=sergio], for long wavelengths the hydrodynamical approach leads to results similar to the scalar field representation.

In the long wavelenght limit, one can fix k  =  0. Hence, the above equations reduce themselves to

[formula]

where decreasing inhomogeneous term, coming from the decoupled variable Θ, were discarded. From, ([\ref=fe2]) it can be verified that density contrast for the dark energy component follows the same behaviour of the pressurelless fluid.

Equation ([\ref=fe1]) may be reduced to the hypergeometric equation

[formula]

where Δm  =  aλ, y  =    -  Aa- 3α and A  =  Ωq0  /  Ωm0. There is one growing solution. In terms of the density contrast, it reads

[formula]

In the long wavelength limit the density contrast for the pressurelless fluid and for the quintessence fluid exhibit a growing mode. Hence, both component clusters.

This result has been obtained in the long wavelength limit. For the analysis of structure formation in such simplified model, finite wavelengths must be considered, mainly those that are smaller or of the order of the Hubble radius. It seems not possible to obtain closed expressions for any value of k. Hence, we must turn to numerical integration. In terms of the cosmic time t the two-fluid perturbed system may be reduced to

[formula]

This system of differential equations may be analyzed, for example, in two asymptotics regimes: when pressurelless matter dominates, leading to [formula]; when the fluid of negative pressure dominates, leading to [formula]. The numerical integration, with k  ≠  0, indicates that, in the matter dominate period, which can be considered as representing the evolution of the universe until z  ~  1, both fluids agglomerate. However, for large values of k, i.e., small wavelength, or in the case where the exotic fluid dominates completly the background, instabilities appears due to hydrodynamical representation of the fluid of negative pressure employed here. For this case, the scalar field representation must be employed. In this high frequency regime, it must be expected that the pressure of the exotic fluid becomes positive [\cite=grisha]. Hence, the question of the clustering of the exotic fluid becomes more delicate. Moreover, at this limit, non-linear effects must be taken into account. Studies performed with quintessential models using spherical symmetries suggest that clustering may occur in this small wavelength limit [\cite=wetterich].

A complete smooth dark energy is obtained for the cosmological case. In fact, with α  =    -  1, Δq  =  0, as it should be expected. Another example of dark energy that remains essentially unclustered is the Chaplygin gas [\cite=patriciabis]. The Chaplygin gas [\cite=kamen] is characterized by an equation of state [formula], where B is a constant. It has an interesting connection with the Nambu-Goto action for a d-brane in a d + 2 dimensional space-time. Due to its particular equation of state, the Chaplygin gas exhibits an initial behaviour similar to a dust fluid for small values of the scale factor, approaching later a behaviour close to a cosmological constant. Hence, it initially clusters, becoming later a smooth component. This behaviour is verified even in presence of ordinary matter [\cite=patricia].

The main goal of the present work is to call attention that, in two-fluid model, fluids with negative pressure exhibit a clustering behaviour, perhaps even in scales below the Hubble radius. The clustering of dark energy has already been studied in some other situations, like a quintessence model with a non-minimal coupling between the scalar-field and the geometry, where the fluctuations in the geometry lead to a dragging effect on the scalar field representing quintessence, due to the non-minimal coupling [\cite=perrotta]. But, using a very simple model, with two barotropic fluids, it has been shown here that the clustering may also occurs in other situations, provided the fluctuations in all components are taken into account, what is the more natural scenario. This, evidently, has important consequences for the structure formation problem, and even for the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation.
