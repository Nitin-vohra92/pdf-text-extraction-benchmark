On the index of a vector field tangent to a hypersurface with non-isolated zero in the embedding space

Introduction

Let [formula] be an isolated singularity of a hypersurface and

[formula]

the germ of a holomorphic vector field on [formula] tangent to (V,0), say Xf = cf, with an isolated zero on (V,0). In [\cite=gsv] is defined a notion of an index [formula] of this vector field, called GSV index and generalizing the Poincaré-Hopf index. By contracting germs of K�hler forms on (V,0) with X one obtains two complexes

[formula]

[formula]

which have both finite dimensional homology spaces, see [\cite=g]. We set

[formula]

It has been proved in [\cite=g] that the topologically defined GSV index is given as

[formula]

Further the numbers hi and h*i are computed under the condition that X has an isolated zero on [formula]. We want to extend these computations to the case that X has an isolated zero only on (V,0) using the same methods as in [\cite=g].

Note that one can assume after a linear change of coordinates in [formula] that [formula] is a regular [formula]-sequence. Throughout this paper we always assume the coordinates to be chosen in this way. We denote by

[formula]

the Milnor algebra of f at 0 and we set

[formula]

We simply write [formula] resp. Ωi instead of [formula] resp. [formula]. [formula] is infinite dimensional and [formula] not necessarily finite dimensional. Our main result is the following:

The [formula]-dimensions of the homology spaces of (ΩV,0,X) are given by

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

The homological index

The first steps are easy generalizations of the computations in [\cite=g]. Consider the complex

[formula]

[formula] [formula], ([formula]) [formula].

It follows immediately from the dual version of Corollary 17.12 of [\cite=e].

Multiplication with c gives us a map of complexes

[formula]

We denote by B the mapping cone associated to this map, see [\cite=e]. We have

[formula]

where

[formula]

and j is the degree of [formula].

Hk(B) = 0 for k  ≥  3 [formula] [formula] [formula].

[formula] is obvious. We have an exact sequence of complexes

[formula]

From the long exact sequence of homology we get Hk(B) = 0 for k  ≥  3 and the non-trivial part of the sequence is

[formula]

where i1 is the inclusion to the first factor and p2 the projection onto the second factor. Now one has

[formula]

by Lemma [\ref=kos1] and the isomorphism given there. Further we get

[formula]

We have [formula] and

[formula]

[formula]

We have an exact sequence of complexes

[formula]

where [formula]. From Lemma [\ref=kos1] one gets the last part of the long exact sequence in homology

[formula]

where δ1 and δ2 are the connecting homomorphisms. This gives us

[formula]

One has [formula], [formula] and [formula]. For

[formula]

we get

[formula]

and therefore

[formula]

We have set [formula] here. On the other hand multiplication gives an isomorphism

[formula]

and this proves

[formula]

Consider ker δ1 now. Then we have

[formula]

We have an isomorphism

[formula]

given as [formula] with [formula]. To prove

[formula]

we have to show

[formula]

" ⊆   ": Let [formula], say [formula] with X(ω) = 0 and so we have [formula]. ω is mapped to fhn + h∂f / ∂zn. Modulo In - 1 we have

[formula]

and this shows the inclusion. Here we have set [formula]. "⊇  ": Let [formula] be a representative, say

[formula]

and h = s1f + s2∂f / ∂zn with [formula]. It follows that and therefore f(s1Xn + s2c) is contained in In - 1. This means that s1Xn + s2c is contained in In - 1, because f is not a zero divisor in [formula]. Let

[formula]

Then one has

[formula]

Set

[formula]

It follows

[formula]

and Therefore [formula] with [formula].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=alg2]

The double complex G

We use the construction as in [\cite=g]. Consider the double complex G:

[formula]

Numeration: Gi,0  =  Ωi, [formula] for k  ≥  1 and Gi,j = 0 for i < 0 or j < 0. The mappings are [formula],

[formula]

and

[formula]

In [\cite=g] it is shown that

[formula]

and

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the total complex of G and λ is defined as in Theorem [\ref=alg2]. The argument there does not use at this stage that [formula] is a regular sequence. The homology spaces of the total complex are also obtained by analizing the spectral sequence (E,d) of G obtained by taking first the α-homology and then the β-homology.

The spectral sequence (E,d)

Let us analyze (E,d). We get the following 2E-terms by Lemma [\ref=kos1] and Lemma [\ref=kos2]:

[formula]

where l  ≥  1 and all other 2E-terms are trivial. The differential on 2E is now given as

[formula]

Therefore the spectral sequence degenerates at the second level and we are able to compute the total homology of the double complex. First note that

[formula]

by the isomorphisms given in Lemma [\ref=kos1] and Lemma [\ref=kos2]. Therefore we get

[formula]

for i  ≥  2 even. Similarly we get

[formula]

for i  ≥  3 odd. Comparing this with the result on [formula] in [\cite=g] as stated above and using Lemma [\ref=kos3] for h*1 Theorem [\ref=alg2] follows.

The following algebras are finite dimensional and for n even

[formula]

and for n odd

[formula]

First note that [formula] and so we get Now it follows

[formula]

and we get the claim for n odd and for n even

[formula]

Since we have an exact sequence

[formula]

we get

[formula]

and the corollary follows.

Now if [formula] is a regular sequence our formula reduces to the formula of Gomez-Mont in the following way. We find that

[formula]

and we get for even n

For n odd we get Note that the formula of Gomez-Mont can also be written in this form.

Relations to residues and examples

The index of the vector field X can also be computed as a residue, see [\cite=lss]: Let [formula] be chosen small enough and the real hypersurfaces {|Xi| = δi}, [formula], in general position. Further let the real (n - 1)-cycle

[formula]

oriented so that [formula]. One defines the holomorphic function [formula] to be the coefficient of tn - 1 in the formal power series expansion of

[formula]

Then one has

[formula]

DX is the Jacobi matrix of X here. Let us compute [formula] explicitely. Denote by σi(DX) the coefficients of the characteristical polynomial of DX, i.e.

[formula]

Set [formula] and [formula]. We have

[formula]

and

[formula]

Then we get Using the formula in [\cite=k] expressing integrals over cycles in V as Grothendieck residues in [formula] we obtain

[formula]

If moreover [formula] is a regular [formula]-sequence we find that there is a [formula] with fk∈In. This means that there is a [formula] with [formula] and therefore we have for any [formula] which means that

[formula]

We have obtained

(i) [formula]. (ii) If [formula] is a regular sequence

[formula]

We remark that the residues are very easy to compute: If [formula] is a regular sequence and [formula] we can find integers [formula] with [formula] and therefore a matrix A with

[formula]

If d is the coefficient of [formula] in the power series expansion of h det A then [formula].

Let us consider an example. Dk:f = x2y + yk - 1 , k  ≥  4.

[formula]

We have c: = xm here. The index can be computed easily with Proposition [\ref=comp] and we obtain [formula]. We want to verify that Corollary [\ref=alg] gives the same value. Using residues again we compute

[formula]

Consider the monomial xmy in [formula]. We find that the monomials [formula] are linearly independent in this algebra and therefore

[formula]

Now we claim

[formula]

Let

[formula]

Then

[formula]

and therefore

[formula]

since y is not a zero divisor in [formula]. This means [formula] since x2 + yk - 2 is not a zero divisor in [formula]. It follows that

[formula]

We also find immediately [formula] and [formula]. Since [formula] we find

[formula]

with [formula]. A basis of [formula] is given by [formula] and therefore [formula] since yk - 2  ~  x2 in [formula]. Now Corollary [\ref=alg] gives in fact

[formula]
