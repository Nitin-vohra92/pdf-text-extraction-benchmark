The Vafa-Witten theorem [\cite=vw] is one of the very few non-perturbative analytic results of QCD. In absence of supersymmetry, non-Abelian continuum gauge theories in 3+1 dimensions do exhibit many very interesting non-perturbative phenomena which have been so far elusive to analytic approaches. However, by a very simple and elegant argument Vafa and Witten [\cite=vw] explained why we do not observe spontaneous violation of parity symmetry, not only in QCD but in any gauge theory with Dirac fermions in 3+1 space-time dimensions. The relevance of the physical implications of this theorem require to further clarify some questions raised about the Vafa-Witten argument (see [\cite=ch] for a review and references therein).

Vafa and Witten claimed that their argument should hold for any parity violating order parameter, but this might not be true in general. In fact, order parameters including higher order composite operators might be non-renormalizable and it is unclear how the argument proceeds in such a case [\cite=ch] [\cite=wu]. On the other hand, non-local order parameters like a Wilson loop around a very small compactified space direction acquire non-trivial vev's. Thus, one should at least restrict the type of order parameter to only local operators which are renormalizable, parity odd and preserve all other symmetries of the system (including gauge symmetry and Lorentz invariance). One of the order parameters matching all these requirements in 3+1 dimensions is the topological density εμνσρFμνFσρ. However, even in that case the argument of Vafa and Witten can be questioned [\cite=ag] [\cite=Ji]. The aim of this note is to rigorously prove the Vafa-Witten theorem for this particular order parameter.

In this case there is no doubt about the existence of a well defined free energy for any real value of the θ parameter. This is guaranteed by unitarity of the theory, which is translated into Osterwalder-Schrader (OS) positivity of the Euclidean functional measure of the theory with real θ-terms [\cite=es] [\cite=am]. We recall that OS positivity is not just the standard positivity used in the Vafa-Witten argument. This special property excludes the possibility that pathological scenarios where the free energy is ill-defined [\cite=ag] might occur in these theories. The Vafa-Witten argument can be correctly applied to show that the free energy density Eθ = Eθ / V at θ = 0 is lower or equal than at θ  ≠  0, i.e. E0  ≤  Eθ.

However, this fact does not mean that the theorem is already proven. One needs to exclude the existence of a cusp in the energy density at θ = 0. The appearance of the cusp would signal the existence of a first order phase transition and spontaneous breaking of parity at θ = 0 without violation of the Vafa-Witten inequality for free energies. The only extra property one needs to prove is smoothness of Eθ at θ = 0, which would make the existence of such a cusp not possible. In other terms, θ = 0 is always an absolute minimum of the free energy density but only if Eθ is smooth we will have E'0 = 0. Only in that case we can make sure that the vacuum expectation value of the topological density vanishes and the Vafa-Witten theorem holds for this particular order parameter.

In fact, due to Bragg symmetry Eπ  +  θ  =  Eπ  -  θ, which follows from CP symmetry Eθ  =  E  -  θ and θ-periodicity Eθ  =  Eθ + 2π, the two classically CP symmetric points θ = 0,π are extremals of the vacuum energy density. However, Eθ is not always smooth at θ  =  π: there are cases where CP is spontaneously broken at that point. In principle, the same pathology could appear also at θ = 0.

In order to prove smoothness, the role of Lee-Yang singularities becomes very relevant. Because of Bragg symmetry and unitarity, non-analyticities are harder to trace in the pure real θ sector. Non-analyticity in θ can be better inferred from the lack of an analytic continuation into the complex θ plane. Indeed, in that case OS positivity (i.e. unitarity) is not preserved and there is even no guarantee that the free energy is well defined, in which case it will not make sense to talk about smoothness. Essentially, there are two possible ways in which the θ theory might give rise to pathological non-analyticities in the complex sector. One possibility is that the analytic continuation to complex values of θ is not defined at all, i.e. the partition function itself becomes divergent. We will see that this possibility does not occur in gauge theories. The other possibility is that the partition function exhibits a sequence of zeros converging to θ = 0 in the infinite volume limit. This is the scenario advocated by Lee and Yang [\cite=ly] which signals in many cases the existence of a phase transition like in the Ising model in presence of an external (imaginary) magnetic field.

The partition function splits into a sum of functional integrals over the different topological sectors In a strict sense, the functional integral is UV divergent but it can be regularized in such a way that its positivity properties are preserved [\cite=aff1]. We will consider such a geometrical regularization whenever it is required. On the other hand, in the infinite volume limit Zθ(g) vanishes unless the vacuum energy is renormalized to 0. But it is just the dependence on θ of the vacuum energy what we want to analyze. Therefore, we will consider throughout the paper a compact space-time with large but finite volume VT <   ∞  .

Positivity of the Yang-Mills Euclidean measure [\cite=amm] [\cite=aff1] and fermionic determinants [\cite=vw] implies the existence of a real effective action [formula]. On the other hand the Yang-Mills action SYM(q) is bounded below by the BPS bound SYM(q)  ≥  8π2|q| in each q-topological sector. We shall see that the total effective action Seff(g,q) is also bounded from below by a similar linear bound involving the absolute value of the topological charge |q|. In the regularized theory, the coefficient of this linear bound increases with the UV regulating scale. This growth of the effective action is enhanced in the chiral limit of light quark masses by the contribution of fermionic determinants. In general, from positivity of fermionic determinants and Yang-Mills measure and the BPS bounds we have the inequality where 1 / 2 = 1 / g2 - (1 / 8π2)|  Im  θ|. This shift of the gauge coupling constant can be considered as a change of the renormalization scale. This shows that the partition function of the original theory with a complex θ-term is bounded by the partition function of a similar theory with θ = 0 but with a different coupling constant. Since the theory at θ = 0 is unitary and renormalizable, its partition function Z0 is finite and from ([\ref=arth]) it follows that [formula] is also finite for small values of   Im  θ. If in addition the theory is asymptotically free, then the renormalization of g2 in the UV fixed point can absorb any value of   Im  θ, which implies that the radius of convergence of the sum ([\ref=ptt]) in the complex θ plane, in fact, becomes infinity. To make the argument more precise one should consider the regularized theory. The analyticity of Zθ also appears naturally in lattice regularizations, even with non-topological regularizations of the θ-term. However, to prove of absence of poles the topological charge bound ([\ref=arth]) is essential. The bare coupling constant g has to be fine tuned according to the renormalization group to yield the appropriate continuum limit. But because of asymptotic freedom this coupling goes to zero as the UV regulator is removed and the shift from g to [formula] induced by   Im  θ simply implies a change in the effective scale of the continuum theory. However, the proof of the Vafa-Witten theorem only requires a finite radius of convergence of Zθ around θ = 0. This feature does not require asymptotic freedom, just renormalizability.

We remark that one cannot use the same kind of arguments for other order parameters. For instance, the partition function associated to higher odd powers of the topological density might diverge for any complex value of the perturbation parameter, as they are non-renormalizable. A similar remark applies to the perturbation by a chemical potential term in theories at finite density. In that case the missing property is the lack of a BPS bound for the perturbation.

The only remaining possible source of non-analyticity is the presence of Lee-Yang singularities, i.e. zeros in the partition function Zθ which could prevent the existence of a unique limit of the free energy log Zθ or its derivatives at θ = 0.

Because of Bragg symmetry and θ-periodicity Zθ is a function of sin 2(ϑ  /  2) and its zeros come in 4-plets [formula] in the modular strip [formula]) of the complex plane. They can be parametrized by their representatives in the positive quadrant ϑn , which cannot lie on the real or imaginary axes for any finite volume.

Only zeros converging to the origin in the thermodynamic limit can give rise to a cusp. Moreover, only an infinity of such zeros can produce the cusp.

The Weierstrass factorization theorem implies that the vacuum energy density

[formula]

can be rewritten in the functional form [\cite=ww] [\cite=nw] where ϑn denotes the order n Lee-Yang zero in the positive quadrant, ρn its degeneracy and hn and g are, respectively, polynomial and analytic functions of  sin 2(ϑ  /  2). The polynomial functions hn are necessary to compensate the divergent effect of zeros with slow approach to the infinite modulus for a given volume.

In the thermodynamic limit the degeneracy factor ρn of zeros converging to the origin defines a density of zeros ρ(z) as a function of the continuous variable z  =  ϑn  /  V. Then, in the thermodynamic limit Notice that only if ρ(0)  ≠  0 the contribution from the logarithm at z = 0 could give rise to a cusp at ϑ = 0. The rest of the contributions from the integral have continuous derivatives for real ϑ at ϑ  =  0. In fact, the logarithmic term in ([\ref=easy:eq:vacuumenergycontinuum]) corresponds to a Coulomb potential, in two dimensions, generated by the charge density -  2ρ(z). The cusp at θ = 0 is only possible if there is a non-vanishing linear charge density at θ = 0 [\cite=evans][\cite=evans1], i.e. ρ(z)  ~  ρ0  δ(z1  -  mzβ2) for |z|  ≪  1 with ρ0  ≠  0. A cusp corresponds to a gap in the potential derivative, which is proportional to the charge density - 2ρ0. Since this charge density is non-positive, the corresponding potential is always repulsive, which means that any cusp is always a [formula] cusp instead of a [formula] cusp. Since the vacuum energy density E(ϑ) has a local minimum at θ = 0 because of the Vafa-Witten inequality such a cusp cannot exist. The theorem follows from two very simple facts, the Vafa-Witten inequality and the repulsive character of the negative charge density defined by - 2ρ(z), which follows from the fact that the partition function ZV(ϑ) is analytic and has zeros but no poles. The only way of having a a [formula] cusp at ϑ = 0 is with an attractive charge density which can only only appear from poles in ZV(ϑ). In fact, this is what happens in 1+1 massless scalar field theories with pseudo-periodic boundary conditions [\cite=adm] where the partition function is non-analytic in the complex plane. However, in QCD the analyticity of the partition function is based in very simple fundamental properties of the theory: unitarity, renormalizability, positivity and existence of BPS bounds. This makes impossible the existence of a cusp in the vacuum energy density at ϑ = 0. In summary, the theory cannot undergo a first order phase transition at θ = 0 with parity symmetry breaking and we have a complete proof of the Vafa-Witten theorem.

From these arguments we cannot, however, exclude the existence of first order phase transitions for other values of θ  ≠  0. In particular, we cannot discard CP symmetry breaking for θ  =  π.

We remark that many other theories share the same properties and therefore the Vafa-Witten theorem can also be extended for all of them. One particularly interesting case is that of CPN non-linear sigma models. Indeed, from a similar analysis one can conclude that there is no spontaneous CP symmetry breaking in CPN models at θ = 0. This result can be checked for the CP1 model where the exact solution is known for θ = 0 [\cite=zamm] [\cite=pw].

The solution of the CP1 model at θ = 0 describes the interaction of a massive scalar particle in the adjoint representation of SU(2), and CP symmetry is preserved confirming the result of the Vafa-Witten theorem.

Another case where an exact solution is also known is the CPN model in the large N limit [\cite=adl]. In this case the system also describes a weakly interacting and parity preserving massive scalar particle in the adjoint representation of SU(N). Let us analyse in some detail how the theorem works in this particular case. The effective action in a topological sector q  ≠  0 with periodic boundary conditions, is given at leading order in N by where 2m is the mass of the physical particles, μ = m  exp(2π / g2) is an energy scale fixing the value of the coupling constant g, V = LT is the volume of the Euclidean space-time T2 and Γ is the Euler gamma function. The effective action has a simple linear asymptotic regime for large values of the topological charge q  >  m2V,

[formula]

The radius of convergence of the partition function Zθ in the pure imaginary axis [formula] is ϑc = N / 2 log 2. The critical value θc increases with N, and in the large N limit the whole pure imaginary axis is free of Lee-Yang singularities in agreement with the general theorem. In the complex θ-plane the radius of convergence around the origin is larger than π / 4 even in the infinite volume limit, which also confirms the Vafa-Witten theorem in the large N limit. Now, the theorem holds not only in that limit, but for any finite value of N as well.

Finally, we remark that the asymptotic behavior of the effective action for small values of the topological charge q < m2V is quadratic instead of linear in q,

[formula]

Since V = LT the change of asymptotic behavior from ([\ref=asymp]) to ([\ref=asymp2]) can be associated with a finite temperature β = 1 / T crossover from the low temperature regime β > m2L / |q| to the high temperature regime β < m2L / |q| and cannot be related to any phase transition [\cite=aff]. One might expect a similar behavior in QCD, although in that case there is a finite temperature phase transition [\cite=kpt].

The arguments used above cannot exclude the existence of higher-order phase transitions which do not require spontaneous parity symmetry breaking. Indeed, if ρ0 = 0 but ρ(z)  ~  ρ1  zα2δ(z1  -  mzβ2) with 0 < α  ≤  1 for |z|  ≪  1, the vacuum energy density presents a second order singularity and the topological susceptibility diverges at ϑ = 0. This behavior is compatible with the Vafa-Witten inequality and might explain the behavior of the topological susceptibility of the CP1 model in numerical simulations [\cite=lh].
