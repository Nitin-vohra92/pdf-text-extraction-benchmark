In the paper [\cite=Lif-Khal] by Lifshitz and Khalatnikov, the quasi-isotropic solution of the Einstein equations near a cosmological singularity was found provided the Universe was filled by radiation with the equation of state [formula]. The metric of this solution was written down in the synchronous system of reference

[formula]

where spatial metric γαβ near the singularity has the form

[formula]

where aαβ and bαβ are functions of spatial coordinates. The functions aαβ are chosen arbitrary, and then the functions bαβ and also the energy and velocity distributions for matter can be expressed through these functions (for details see [\cite=Lif-Khal] and also [\cite=Lif-Khal1] [\cite=Land-Lif]).

In correspondence with the standard cosmological model of the hot Universe, it was supposed that the natural equation of state for the matter near the cosmological singularity is that of radiation: p = ε / 3. However, nowadays the situation has changed in connection with the development of inflationary cosmological models, which as an important ingredient contain inflaton scalar field or/and other exotic types of matter [\cite=inflation]. One can add also that the appearance of brane and M theory cosmological models [\cite=brane] and the discovery of the cosmic acceleration [\cite=cosmic] suggests that the matter playing essential role on different stages of cosmological evolution can obey very different equations of state [\cite=varun]. Thus, generalization of the old quasi-isotropic solution of the Einstein equations near the cosmological singularity can be useful in this new context.

In this note we make such a generalization for the equation of state:

[formula]

where p denotes pressure and ε denotes energy density . The Friedmann isotropic solution near the singularity for such a matter behaves as

[formula]

where

[formula]

We look for an expression for a spatial metric in the following form:

[formula]

where the power index m is given by Eq. ([\ref=Friedmann1]). We leave the power index n free for some time, requiring only that

[formula]

The inverse metric reads

[formula]

where aαβ is defined by the relation

[formula]

while the indices of all the other matrices are lowered and raised by aαβ and aαβ, for example,

[formula]

Let us write down also expressions for the extrinsic curvature, its contractions and its derivatives:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

We need also an explicit expression for the determinant of the spatial metric:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Now, using well-known expressions for the components of the Ricci tensor [\cite=Land-Lif]:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

where Pβα is a three-dimensional part of the Ricci tensor, and substituting into Eqs. ([\ref=curvature])-([\ref=curvature2]) the expressions ([\ref=extrinsic])-([\ref=determin2]), one get

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Notice, that in Eq. ([\ref=curvature5]) P̃βα denotes a three-dimensional Ricci tensor constructed by using the metrics aαβ. The terms in the curvature tensor Pβα, which are proportional to βαβ have the time dependence [formula] and are less divergent than the first term in the right-hand side of Eq. ([\ref=curvature5]) provided the condition ([\ref=inequality]) is satisfied.

Now, let us write down the expressions for the components of the energy-momentum tensor of the perfect fluid

[formula]

satisfying the equation of state ([\ref=state]). Up to higher-order corrections, they have the following form :

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Using the Einstein equations

[formula]

one has from 00-component of these equations:

[formula]

and from 0α-component of these equations one has

[formula]

Now, writing down the spatial components of the Einstein equations, using the expressions ([\ref=tensor3])-([\ref=tensor4]) and the expression ([\ref=energy]) for the energy density ε, one get:

[formula]

Using the relation ([\ref=Friedmann1]) it is easy to check that the terms proportional to [formula] in the left- and right-hand sides of Eq. ([\ref=Einstein1]) cancel each other. On the other hand, the only way to cancel the term [formula] is to require that the terms proportional to [formula] behave as the term [formula], i.e.

[formula]

In this case, the condition of cancellation of terms proportional to [formula] gives the following expression for the tensor bβα:

[formula]

Using the relation ([\ref=Friedmann1]) one can rewrite the expression ([\ref=b]) in the following form:

[formula]

It is easy to see that the Eq. ([\ref=b1]) expressing the second-order correction for the spatial metric ([\ref=expansion]) is well defined for all the types of hydrodynamical matter with 0  ≤  k  ≤  1, including the stiff matter, i.e. a fluid with the equation of state p  =  ε.

Now, using the relation

[formula]

and the formulae ([\ref=b1]) and ([\ref=velocity]) we arrive to the following expression for the three-dimensional velocity uα:

[formula]

Note that the velocity flow is potential. Actually, it can be shown that this important property remains in all higher orders of perturbative expansion for the quasi-isotropic solution. Similarly, the expression for the energy density of matter ([\ref=energy]) can be rewritten as

[formula]

It is straightforward to check that further terms of perturbative expansion ([\ref=expansion]) for the metric γαβ have the following form:

[formula]

Thus, we have seen that this expansion has a curious feature. The order of its first term tm is defined by the equation of state of the matter ([\ref=state]), the second order term always has the behavior ~  t2, while logarithmic distance between orders is equal to 2 - m.

It is easy to understand that the quasi-isotropic expansion does work if and only if the first term in the right-hand side of Eq. ([\ref=metric]) is smaller than the second one. Remembering that n  =  2 for any value of m and using the equation ([\ref=Friedmann1]), we get the following restriction on the parameter k from the equation of state ([\ref=state]):

[formula]

Thus, for the values k  ≤   - 1 / 3 the quasi-isotropic expansion at small times may not be constructed. It is interesting to notice, however, that for [formula], a quasi-isotropic-like solution arises as a late-time (t  →    ∞  ) attractor for generic inhomogeneous evolution of space-time [\cite=Star] (this regime is the power-law inflation [\cite=L] actually). Of course, perturbative expansion is made in inverse powers of t in that case. Also, we would like to note that different aspects of relation between the quasi-isotropic expansion and other approximation schemes were considered in detail in the papers [\cite=Deruelle].
