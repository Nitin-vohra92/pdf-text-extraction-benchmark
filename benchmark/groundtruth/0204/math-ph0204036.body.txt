1. Introduction.

Differential constraints arisen originally in the theory of partial differential equations of the first order. In particular Jacobi used differential constraints to find the total integral of nonlinear equation

[formula]

König applied them to the equation of the second order [\cite=gou1]. They required that the corresponding over-determined system was compatible. The general theory of over-determined systems was developed by Delassus, Riquier, Cartan, Ritt, Kuranishi, Spencer and others. One can find references in the book of Pommaret [\cite=pom2]. Now the applications of over-determined systems include such diverse fields as differential geometry, continuum mechanics and nonlinear optics.

The general formulation of the method of differential constraints requires that the original system of partial differential equations

[formula]

be enlarged by appending additional differential equations (differential constraints)

[formula]

such that the over-determined system (1), (2) satisfies some conditions of compatibility.

One can derive many exact solutions of partial differential equation by means of differential constraints. It was particularly shown in [\cite=and3] that some soliton solutions can be found using differential constraints. Olver and Rosenau [\cite=olv4], Olver [\cite=olv5], Kaptsov [\cite=and3], Levi and Winternitz [\cite=lev6] show that many reduction methods such as non-classical symmetry groups, partial invariance, separation of variables, the Clarkson-Kruskal direct method can be included into the method of differential constraints. In practice, methods based on the Riquier-Ritt theory of over-determined systems of partial differential equations may be difficult. The problem of finding all differential constraints compatible with certain equations can be more complicated than the investigation of the original equations.

It was recently proposed a new method for finding differential constraints which uses linear determining equations. These equations are more general than the classical determining equations for Lie generators [\cite=ovs7] and depend on some parameters. Given an evolution equation

[formula]

where [formula], then according to [\cite=kap8] the linear determining equation corresponding to (3) is of the form

[formula]

Here and throughout Dt,Dx are the operators of total differentiation with respect to t and x. Equality (4) must hold for all solutions of (3). The function h may depends on [formula]. The number p is called the order of the solution of equation (4). If we have some solution h then corresponding differential constraint is

[formula]

It was also shown in [\cite=kap8] that equations (4) and (5) constitute the compatible system. Thus we sketch the derivation of some solutions to the evolution equation (4). (I) Find solutions of the linear determining equations (4). (II) Fixing the function h, we obtain differential constrain (5). (III) Find the general solution of (5) which includes some arbitrary functions ai depending on t. (IV)Substitute the general solution into (4). It leads to ordinary differential equations for functions ai. (V) Solve the ordinary differential equations and obtain a solution of the evolution equation (4).

In this paper we start with determination of the solutions of linear determining equations of the second and third orders for the nonlinear diffusion equation

[formula]

These solutions exist only if f belongs to the special forms. Then we use the obtained functions h to find solutions of equation (6). In final section we derive exact solutions of two-dimension equation

[formula]

2. Solutions of linear determining equations.

The nonlinear diffusion equation

[formula]

often arises in the description of various physical processes. The group classification of the equation has been carried out in [\cite=dor9]. Some exact solutions of (7) can be found in [\cite=gal10] [\cite=cla11]. In physical applications Q is usually taken to be a power function. In this section we consider the equation

[formula]

where f is an differentiable function, q  ≠  0. If q =  - 2, f = u or f = const then the equation (8) can be linearized. We shall not discuss this case here.

The linear determining equation, which corresponds to (8), is

[formula]

where [formula] We shall seek solutions to (9) in the form

[formula]

where n  ≥  2, [formula] The method for finding solutions is very similar to the standard procedure applied in the group analysis of differential equations [\cite=olv12] and only one of all possibilities is described here for the sake of brevity.

We set n = 2. First, let us express all t-derivatives in (9) using (8). As a result, the left-hand side of (3.4) becomes a polynomial with respect to u3,u2. The polynomial must identically vanish. Collecting similar terms we obtain the following relations for the coefficients of u3 and u22

[formula]

Thus b1  =  4 and g can be represented as follows

[formula]

here a and g1 must be functions of u,t and x alone. Collecting the coefficients of u2u21 and u2u1, we have the equations

[formula]

[formula]

In follows from the last equation that

[formula]

where a1 is a function of t and x. Next we consider the coefficient u31 and obtain equation

[formula]

From (10) and (11) it follows that b3 = 1 or [formula]

Assuming b3 = 1, we obtain [formula] The coefficient of u2 give us equation

[formula]

The equation enables us to express

[formula]

The coefficient of u21 yields Euler equation

[formula]

Consider for simplicity the case b4 = 1. It is easy to see that the last equation has two types of solutions:

[formula]

or

[formula]

where k,n are arbitrary constants. Let us focus on f  =  ku  +  nu- q. It follows from above calculations and equation (9) that

[formula]

[formula]

From (12) we have na1  =  0.

If a1 = 0 then the solution of (9) is h = u2  +  qu21 / u. If n = 0 and q  ≠   - 4 / 3 then one easily computes

[formula]

[formula]

In the case q  =   - 4 / 3, we obtain

[formula]

[formula]

It can be shown that the found functions h lead to invariant solutions of the corresponding equation (8).

We omit here for the sake of brevity intermediate calculations and give the list of solutions to the equation (9): (1) if q =  - 1 and f  =  su  +  ru ln (u) then

[formula]

(2) if q  ≠   - 1 and f  =  su + ru- q then

[formula]

(3) if q  =   - 2 and f  =  su  +  ru3 then

[formula]

(4) if q  =  1 and f  =  ru then

[formula]

(5) if q is an arbitrary constant and f  =  su  +  ru1 - q then

[formula]

with r,s∈R. We did not include functions h that correspond to invariant solutions of the equation (8).

If we will look for solutions to the equation (9), which depend on third derivative, then obtain the following list: (1) if q is an arbitrary constant and [formula] then

[formula]

(2a) if q  ≠  1 and [formula] then

[formula]

(2b) if q  =   - 2 or q =  - 4 / 3 and [formula] then h is also given by (13); (3) if [formula] and f  =  mu then

[formula]

(4) if [formula] and f  =  nu  +  mu5 / 2 then

[formula]

(5) if [formula] and f  =  mu  -  2ku1 / 2 then

[formula]

(6) if [formula] and f  =  nu then

[formula]

(7) if q  =   - 1 and f  =  mu then

[formula]

with r,s,m,n∈R. Here we also did not include functions h leading to invariant solutions of (8).

3. Solutions of diffusion equations.

In this section we shall use the functions obtained above to construct solutions of diffusion equations (8). One can apply the method described in introduction.

We first take the function h = u2  +  qu21 / u, where q∈R, corresponding to some cases mentioned above. Simply by equating this function to zero, we obtain the differential constraint

[formula]

The equation (14) has two types of solutions:

[formula]

[formula]

where c1,c2 are functions of t.

If we substitute the representation (16) into equation

[formula]

then this leads us to differential equations for c1,c2. From this equations it is easy to find c1,c2 and obtain the following solution of (17)

[formula]

Substituting (15) into equation

[formula]

we find the solution

[formula]

with a,b∈R.

It is easy to see that the differential constraint

[formula]

for equation

[formula]

leads to solution

[formula]

Now let us consider the differential constraints of the third order. We start with the equation

[formula]

As explained above this equation is compatible with the differential constraint

[formula]

By a change of variable v  =  uq one may rewrite (18), (19) in the following way

[formula]

[formula]

If n  =   - 1 then it follows from (21) that

[formula]

where a,b and c are some functions of t. Substituting this representation into equation (20) we obtain the system of ordinary differential equations for the function a,b and c:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Using finite-dimensional invariant subspaces, Galaktionov [\cite=gal13] found representation (22).

From (24) and (25) we derive the first integral b = kc, k∈R. Therefore the system (23)-(25) can be reduced to nonlinear ordinary differential equation for the function a. In general we can not express solutions of (23)-(25) in terms of the elementary functions. We give one example of exact solution of equation (20), with q =  - 1 and r = 0. This solution has the representation (22) and the functions a,b,c are

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

where a1  =  pr21, a3  =  p2r41 / 4a2, r1  =    -  s and p,a2,m are arbitrary constants.

Now let us consider the equation

[formula]

and the differential constraint

[formula]

Using the equation (26), one can write (27) as

[formula]

Replacing ln (emt / 2u- 1) by w, the last equation is replaced by the Liouville equation

[formula]

Since the general solution of the Liouville equation is

[formula]

it gives the representation

[formula]

where T and X are the arbitrary functions of t and x respectively. Substituting this representation into (26), we have

[formula]

[formula]

Differentiating (29) with respect to t, it is easy to obtain the equation for T

[formula]

If m  ≠  0 then the function

[formula]

is the general solution of this equation. Substituting the function T into (29), we get the following equation for X

[formula]

It should be noted that (28) is equivalent to the representation

[formula]

where a1,a2 are functions of x. This representation yields the following system for a1 and a2

[formula]

[formula]

In general, it is possible to express a1 in terms of the Weierstrass function [formula] and a2 in terms of Lamé's function [\cite=whi14] . However, if m  =  12 and k  =  4 , then the functions

[formula]

[formula]

satisfy the equations (30), (31).

According to our results in the previous section, as k = 0 , the equation (26) is compatible with the differential constraint

[formula]

Using the equation (26), one can write (32) as

[formula]

Replacing ln (e- 3mt / 2u) by w in (33) yields

[formula]

If we set s = 0 then from the last equation we find the following representation

[formula]

where T and X are the arbitrary functions of t and x respectively. Substituting this representation into (26) leads to equation

[formula]

[formula]

Introducing new functions

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

one can write the last equation as

[formula]

It is possible consider (34) as condition of orthogonality of two vector functions Z  =  (C,T,T2,Q,1),  W  =  (X,D,B,1,R).

Denote by ρ(Z) and ρ(W) the number of linearity independent functions among C,T,T2,Q,1 and X,D,B,R,1 respectively. From orthogonality condition it follows that ρ(Z)  +  ρ(W)  ≤  5. It is possible to show that if [formula] then ρ(Z)  =  3 and ρ(W)  =  2. In this case we have

[formula]

with ai,bi∈R. Because of (34) and definition of the functions D,B,R we obtain equations

[formula]

[formula]

where c3,c2,c1 and c0 are arbitrary constants, A = ( - 2r)1 / 3.

The solutions of (35) and (36) can be expressed in the terms of the Weierstrass function [formula] [\cite=gol15]. Indeed, one can write (35) and (36) as

[formula]

[formula]

Replacing X - α1 by 1 / Y in (38) yields

[formula]

where [formula] Introducing new function Z such that Z3  =  B(Y - b1)(Y - b2), we obtain equation

[formula]

The solutions of the last equation are expressed in the terms of the Weierstrass function [formula]. Applying the above process to (36), we obtain equation such as (39).

We shall omit here other cases and discuss briefly in the next section two-dimensional equation.

4. Two-dimensional equation.

We consider here the fast diffusion equation

[formula]

Some applications of this equation can be found in [\cite=ari16]. Galaktionov [\cite=gal10] used invariant subspaces to find some solutions of (40). If we set u  =  1 / v, we obtain

[formula]

It is easy to check that one of elementary solutions of (41) is travelling wave given by

[formula]

where c,m and n are arbitrary constants. Obviously, this is invariant solution. On the other hand, this solution satisfies differential constraints

[formula]

[formula]

It is possible to find other differential constraints that are linear with respect x,y and v.

It can be shown that the differential constraints

[formula]

[formula]

are compatible with the equation (41). Here c0 and c1 are arbitrary constants. The solution of (41) corresponding to these constraints is

[formula]

Here c0,c1,c2 are arbitrary constants and

[formula]

We can derive other explicit solutions using invariant subspaces [\cite=gal10] or linear differential constraints. For example, from [\cite=gal10] one may extract the following representation

[formula]

where functions si(t) satisfy ordinary differential equations

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Because of (44) and (45) we find

[formula]

This yields

[formula]

By arguments similar to that used above we have

[formula]

Substituting this into (43) leads to

[formula]

From (45) we express the function s0 and obtain

[formula]

with a = 4c4,  b = c21  +  c22.

Setting a = b = 1 one can derive two elementary solutions

[formula]

In general, the solutions of (46) can be expressed in terms of elliptic functions. It is easy to obtain the correspondent function u.

The more complicated representation is

[formula]

[formula]

where si are functions which satisfy some ordinary differential equations. The special case of this representation was found in [\cite=gal10].

It is important to note that the equation (40) is invariant under infinite-dimensional algebra of symmetry [\cite=dor9]. Some solutions of (40) were obtained by means of these symmetries in [\cite=dor9]. We shall describe other method of using symmetry. It is convenient to apply the complex conjugate variables z  =  x + iy,   =  x - iy. Thus, we can write the equation (40) as

[formula]

It is easy to check that (47) is invariant under the transformation

[formula]

where A(z) and B() are arbitrary functions. In other words, if the function f(t,z,) is a solution of (47) then [formula] also satisfies (47).

For example, if we set m = n = 1 then from (42) we can construct the solution of the equation (40)

[formula]

where A is an arbitrary function of z and Ā is the complex conjugate function.

5. Conclusions.

In sections 2 and 3 we have shown how the method of the linear determining equations can be applied to find explicit solutions to nonlinear diffusion equations. We have found exact solutions of these equations, using only the simplest solutions of the linear determining equations. It is interesting to find solutions of the linear determining equations depending on derivatives of higher orders. A.Shmidt [\cite=shm17] [\cite=shm18] applied this method to another parabolic equations and some systems; application to the elliptic equation is discussed in [\cite=kap8].

In section 4 we have considered the two-dimensional equation. Applications of systems of the linear determining equations to multi-dimensional equations briefly discussed in [\cite=kap19]. Using results of section 3 one can find the following representation

[formula]

of solution of the equation

[formula]

where the functions a(x,y) and b(x,y) must satisfy the system

[formula]

[formula]

It is easy to show that the differential constraint

[formula]

leads to the representation (48). The interesting reductions of some diffusion equations in several independent variables can be found in [\cite=gal20] [\cite=rud21]. It is important to explain these reductions by means of differential constraints.
