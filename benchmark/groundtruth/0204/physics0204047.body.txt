Proton Wires in an Electric Field: the Impact of Grotthuss Mechanism on Charge Translocation

INTRODUCTION

Translocation of protons over long distances has a key importance for biological and chemical systems. It is believed that proton migration along the chains of water molecules formed between the interior of proteins and the solvent, establishes electrochemical potential gradients playing an important functional role [\cite=gennis] [\cite=lanyi]. Experimental evidence indicates that the dominant mechanism responsible for proton transport in transmembrane proteins (for instance, in bacteriorhodopsin of Halobacterium halobium [\cite=stoeckenius] [\cite=nagle] and in gramicidin A channels [\cite=levitt] [\cite=nagle]) is the diffusion of H+ ions which is faster than the hydrodynamic flow of hydronium species (H3O)+. Especially at low hydrogen concentrations in channels, proton conduction is determined by a two-stage Grotthuss-type mechanism [\cite=cukierman] [\cite=onsager] shown schematically in Fig. 1(a). The first stage involves the intrabond proton tunnelling along the hydrogen bridge which is connected with the formation and transfer of ionic positive (H3O+) and negative (OH-) charged defects. To sustain a flux of H+ in such proton wire, the inter-molecular proton transfer due to the reorientations of molecular group with proton is assumed. Reorientation motion leads to the breaking of the hydrogen bond (so-called orientational Bjerrum L-defect) and location of proton between another pair of molecular groups [\cite=bjerrum]. Consequently, the reorientation step in the presence of the second proton may induce high-energy configuration with both of the protons shared by two adjacent oxygen ions (Bjerrum D-defect).

Unlike the translocation of monovalent ions like Cs+, Na+ or K+ via gramicidin requiring the net diffusion of the whole water column in the channel, the existence of the Grotthuss-type selective migration of H+ through the H-bonded chain is supported by the absence of streaming potentials during H+ permeation [\cite=akeson] [\cite=levitt]. In contrast to the bulk water, the reorientation motion in one-dimensional water wire involving a migration of Bjerrum defects with the period of reorientations about 10- 10 s, is much slower than the proton intra-bond hopping (~  10- 12 s)[\cite=nagle1] [\cite=chernyshev]. This is also closely related to the fact that the mobility of Bjerrum defects (~  10- 4 cm3V- 1s- 1) is much lower than that of the ionic defects (~  10- 2 cm3V- 1s- 1) [\cite=eisenberg]. Moreover, as appears from the results of molecular dynamics simulations [\cite=pomes3], the translocation of the ionic defects in proton wires is almost activationless process, whereas the orientation defects involving an activation energy of about 5 kcal/mol in the chain containing eight water molecules, constitute a limiting step for the proton migration. Besides the orientation defects, the recent experiments indicate that another possible rate-limiting step for the proton migration in gramicidin channels can be at the membrane-channel/solution interface[\cite=chernyshev] [\cite=godoy].

As was pointed in [\cite=cukierman], the experimental analysis of the proton flow in bioenergetic proteins and the mechanism of proton translocation is very difficult because of its intrinsically transient nature. To shed more light on the microscopic nature of the proton transport and to analyze the influence of quantum effects and interaction with proton surrounding, theoretical modeling remains to be essentially important. Recently, much attention has been focused on the theoretical studies of the dynamics of ionic defects using soliton models [\cite=zol1] [\cite=zol2] and molecular dynamics simulations [\cite=tuck1] [\cite=tuck2] [\cite=schumaker] [\cite=schumaker2]. Proton transfer in water was shown to be strongly coupled with the dynamics of local environment, and the density of ionic defects was found to increase exponentially with the increasing temperature[\cite=zol1]. However, since the concentration of slow Bjerrum defects in water solutions is much higher (cB = 2  ·  10- 7 at [formula] C) than that of fast ionic (cI = 3  ·  10- 12)[\cite=eisenberg], the investigations of the reorientation step of proton migration are necessary for the better understanding of the proton transport process.

The goal of the present work is to study proton wire containing a finite number of water molecules by the use of quantum statistical mechanics methods which are extremely effective in the description of the collective nature of the proton transfer and in the quantum treatment of the light H nuclei [\cite=davydov2]. To describe correctly the proton transport process, we employ here two-stage proton transport model [\cite=jps] incorporating quantum effects such as proton tunneling and zero-point vibration energy. In earlier papers [\cite=pavlenko1] [\cite=pavlenko2] [\cite=pavlenko3] we applied the two-stage model to analyze the effect of coupling between protons and molecular group vibrations on proton conductivity in infinite H-bonded chains and proton-conducting planes. In particular, it was shown that the proton-lattice vibration interactions induce structural instabilities and charge ordering in system [\cite=pavlenko1], whereas the Grotthuss-type transport mechanism manifests itself in nontrivial temperature- and frequency dependences of the proton conductivity [\cite=pavlenko2] [\cite=pavlenko3] [\cite=pavlenko4].

In this work we analyze the influence of proton-proton correlations, comparing two different protonated chains containing one and two excess protons respectively. We find that the reaction of protonation of water chain is extremely sensitive to the reorientation energy barrier of proton motion and the barrier for the chain protonation. We show that the increase of the reorientation energy results in the drastic decrease of the proton charge density at the boundary between the chain and surrounding with consequent localization of protons near the inner water molecules. As appears from our modeling, the application of external electric field induces the step-like threshold-type effects with the ordering of proton charge and stabilization of Bjerrum D-defects in the wire. We analyze the temperature dependence of proton polarization and D-defect concentration, and examine the role of the interplay between different factors (such as orientation energy, external field and temperature) in the dynamics of Bjerrum defects.

MODEL SPECIFICATION AND METHOD OF CALCULATION

To model a proton wire, we consider a linear chain containing N hydrogen bonds and [formula] molecular groups. The outer left (l = 1) and right (l = N + 1) molecular complexes mimic the surrounding of the proton wire and differ from the inner ([formula]) water molecules. The transport of an excess proton through the wire proceeds via the following two steps: (i) proton can be transferred within a H-bond (process shown by short arrows in Fig. 1(a)) which is modelled by a simple double-well potential, with the corresponding energy barrier ΩT for the proton transfer between the two minima:

[formula]

where c+lν(clν) are the operators of the proton creation(annihilation) in the position (l, ν) (the index ν  =  {a,b} denotes the left/right position for the proton within the H-bond); (ii) a water molecule together with covalently bonded hydrogen ion can be rotated, and this process causes the breaking of the H-bond and location of H+ between two another nearest water molecules of the wire (process depicted by long arrows in Fig. 1(a)):

[formula]

where ΩR is the effective energy barrier for the proton hopping between the states |l + 1,a〉 and |l,b〉 (reorientation of the l-th molecular group together with proton). As is shown in [\cite=pomes2] by the computation of the proton mean-force potential, this transition between donor-acceptor and acceptor-donor states reverses the chain dipole moment and requires a substantial energy barrier about 5.5 kcal/mol for the whole chain containing up to eight water molecules.

Besides the transport process, we incorporate the following two types of interactions between protons in the chain: (iii) different short-range configurations of the protons near an inner water molecule as well as an outer molecular group can appear due to the different nature of bonding (shorter covalent or longer H-bond). The energies of possible configurations (shown in Fig. 1(b)) are described by the following terms:

[formula]

The parts H1 and HN + 1 describe the energies of the boundary proton configurations near the left and the right surrounding molecular groups (we assume for simplicity 1  =  N + 1  =   and w̃1  =  w̃N + 1  =  w̃ in the boundary configurations shown in the upper scheme of Fig. 1(b)). The terms Hl ([formula]) contain the configuration energies for the water molecules in the interior of the wire (the lower part in Fig. 1(b)). Here the proton occupancy operators nlν = c+lνclν  =  {0,1}; (iv) a strong repulsion between two nearest protons shared by two neighboring oxygens (so called Bjerrum D-defect) with a repulsion energy U is represented by the term:

[formula]

In our following analysis we use the value of U  ≈  10 kcal/mol corresponding to the energy of relaxed D-defect estimated in [\cite=campbell] on the basis of quantum chemical calculations.

To model a field exerted by the surrounding, we apply an external electric field of a strength E to the proton wire, which is described by the following term

[formula]

where Rlν is the coordinate of the proton position (l, ν) with respect to the center of the chain, and ep denotes the proton charge.

In order to analyze the dynamics of the proton wire embedded in the surrounding under the influence of the field, as well as the effect of rotational motions of covalent groups with proton, we will focus our attention on the polarization of the proton wire defined here as

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the statistical average with respect to the system energy ([\ref=h_t]-[\ref=h_e]). The average probabilities 〈nlν〉 of occupation of the position (l, ν) by proton describe the distribution of the proton charge in the wire, and thus is another very important characteristics to track the proton migration.

To calculate exactly the above-mentioned statistical averages, we need to know the quantum energy levels determined by the energy ([\ref=h_t]-[\ref=h_e]). This can be done by a mapping of the proton states (l,ν) on the multi-site basis [formula]. Then, using the projection operators Xii' = |i〉〈i'| acting on the new basis |i〉 we rewrite the system energy ([\ref=h_t]-[\ref=h_e]) in a convenient form (see Appendix):

[formula]

Each term Hnp in ([\ref=ham]) corresponds exactly to np protons in the chain ([formula]). This means in fact that the mapping on the states |i〉 allows to decompose the terms ([\ref=h_t]-[\ref=h_e]) and analyze the cases of different number of protons in the wire separately.

The energy barrier for the protonation of the chain is described by the parameter Δ which appears in ([\ref=ham]) after the decomposition procedure (see Appendix). As follows from the definition ([\ref=delta]), Δ is the difference between the energies of the proton attraction to the boundary and to the inner water molecules. As the PMF-studies of the H-bonded chain dynamics [\cite=pomes2] show that the inner H-bonds are stronger (shorter O-O separation distances) than the outer H-bonds, it is reasonable to consider below the case Δ < 0 (we take |Δ| = 0.85 kcal/mol in our numerical calculations), when the proton is attracted to the surrounding and needs to overcome the boundary energy barrier |Δ| to protonate the water chain.

The parameter J = w + w' - 2ε (see Fig. 1(b)) is related to the effective short-range interactions between the protons near the water molecule. It describes, in fact, the energy of the formation of the pair of ionic defects: I+=H3O+ (w - ε) and I-=OH- (ε - w') from two water molecules at the dissociation reaction (2H2O →   H3O++OH-). Since the value of J is about 22 kcal/mol [\cite=eisenberg] [\cite=rao] and is more than twice as much as U, we exclude in our following analysis an appearance of the pair of ionic defects in the system.

Due to the two types of motions we have two different contributions to the proton dipole moment: the orientational part μr = epRr and the transfer part μab = epRab where Rab = Rlb - Rla denotes the distance H-H between the two nearest proton positions of the double-well H-bond. In our calculations, we use the values μab = 3.5 D and μab = 4.5 D corresponding to the moderately strong H-bond with an O-O distance Rab + 2Rr = 2.6Å and the covalent O-H bond of a length Rr = 0.94Å.

CASE STUDY: ONE EXCESS PROTON IN CHAIN

As the starting point, in this section we mimic the situation when one proton is moved towards the water chain embedded into the solvent. To examine the behavior of the protonated chain with N H-bonds and n = 1 excess proton, we consider H1 part of the energy given by ([\ref=ham_decomp]). Since the zero-point vibration energy for protonated chains is larger than the potential energy barrier for the proton transfer between two shared oxygens [\cite=pomes], the quantum tunneling is not required for the intra-bond H+ transfer. Thus, in our modelling we set ΩT  ≈  0. With this assumption, the energy levels of H1 can be found exactly:

[formula]

where [formula].

To analyze the role of ΩR we consider first the case without external field (E = 0). Depending on the value of ΩR, two different regimes may be stabilized in the system. In the first small-ΩR regime, the two lowest energy levels λ1,2 correspond to the superposition of the two boundary states

[formula]

with the proton located in the surrounding near the left or the right outer molecular groups. In the second large-ΩR regime the proton is shared between the inner water molecules of the chain and the ground state of the system corresponds to the superposition of the states

[formula]

with the energies [formula]. The "critical" value Ω*R =  - Δ separating these two regimes, reflects the transition of the proton from the surrounding to the states where the proton is shared by the chain water molecules, which corresponds to the protonation chemical reaction. Fig. 2 shows the variation of the average occupancies of proton sites with ΩR for the chains containing N = 2 and N = 3 H-bonds. For low temperatures (see the case T = 30K) the boundary proton occupancies 〈n1a〉  =  〈nNb〉 drop drastically to zero at ΩR  =  Ω*R, whereas the occupation numbers of the central positions [formula] increase up to the value [formula], reflecting the redistribution of collectivized proton between the inner sites in the wire. It should be noted here that Ω*R reflects the change of the ground state of the system and is determined as the solution of the equation [formula] at E = 0 which does not depend on temperature. However, as all statistical averages, the average proton occupancies (for example, of the states [formula] and [formula] where [formula] and [formula] are the diagonalized states corresponding to λ4 and λ3 respectively), are temperature dependent. Thus the value of Ω*R(T)  ≈    -  Δ + kT ln 2 where 〈n1a〉  =  〈n2b〉, for T  ≠  0 is not equal to Ω*R (see Fig. 2, case T = 300K). This difference shows that the inner proton states ([\ref=inner]) are stabilized already at lower ΩR  =  Ω*R  <  Ω*R(T), although the occupancies of the inner positions at ΩR  =  Ω*R are still slightly lower then of the outer due to the temperature-induced fluctuations. As T  →  0, the fluctuations decrease and Ω*R(T)  →  Ω*R.

The effect of the proton localization inside the chain is supported by the results reported in [\cite=pomes] [\cite=pomes2] showing that in H-bonded finite chains, the excess charge is best solvated by the central H-bonds. However, as results from the presented above analysis, the effect of proton localization is drastically influenced by the competition between two different tendencies: (i) for small ΩR, the proton is located near the surrounding/wire interface due to the nonzero protonation barrier Δ; (ii) to overcome the barrier between the surrounding and the wire, the reorientation energy should be sufficiently large (ΩR  >    -  Δ) in order to stabilize the inner proton configurations. These conclusions show that in general, these two different factors (interface barrier and orientations) can be rate-limiting for the charge translocation and proton conductivity of the wire. As was shown in [\cite=phillips], the effective reorientation barrier can be influenced by temperature factor or applied voltage (for example, the reorientation rate of the wire decreases exponentially with T decrease). Thus, one can also expect that the increase of the temperature can result in the lower orientation barrier ΩR, delocalization of proton and consequently in higher values for the proton conductivity through the channel. However, more detailed theoretical analysis is needed to understand better the role of the interface in the behavior of the conductivity.

We turn now to an analysis of the proton translocation directed by the external field (the case E  ≠  0). Fig. 3 shows the field-dependences of P and 〈nlν〉 for the chain containing N = 2 H-bonds. We note that the behavior in the first small- and in the second large-ΩR regime differs drastically. In the small-ΩR regime the polarization increases smoothly with E approaching finally its maximal saturation value Pmax  =  μr  +  μab (Fig. 3(a), inset). In contrast to this, in the large-ΩR regime the field dependence is rather nontrivial: first, for E < Ethresh, P changes very slowly, and than, at E  ~  Ethresh a strong increase of P to P = Pmax is observed in Fig. 3(a). This rapid step-like change of the proton polarization reflects the threshold-type effect where the threshold electric field value at low T is given by

[formula]

and does not depend on the chain size N (Ethresh  ≈  0.15  ·  10- 7 V/cm for the chains with N = 2 as can be observed in Fig. 3(a)). As we see in Fig. 3(b), the proton charge translocation under the influence of the field in this case proceeds not smoothly, but has a step-like character. As results from ([\ref=thresh]), the threshold value Ethresh (which is needed to overcome a barrier for pumping between the inner localized states ([\ref=inner]) and the boundary state [formula] in the direction of field) increases for larger ΩR (Fig. 3(a), the cases with ΩR = 1.5 kcal/mol and ΩR = 2.15 kcal/mol). This implies that the conductivity of protonated chains can drop with an increasing ΩR which can occur in system for example due to the temperature-induced fluctuations of ΩR. However, as was shown in [\cite=phillips], the reorientation rate increases at increased voltage, which corresponds in our case to the smaller values of ΩR for E  ≠  0. Thus, we can expect that the external field-induced lowering of the orientation barrier for the proton translocation results in the increase of the proton conductivity in the wire.

The drastic change of P at E = Ethresh leads to a strong qualitative difference in the temperature shapes of the polarization profiles shown in Fig. 4(a) for the large-ΩR regime. For E < Ethresh and ΩR  >  Ω*R, the excess proton is located in the central sites, and the increase of T results in a disorder-induced transfer of the proton from the inner positions to the chain boundary giving the increase of P at 300 K as compared to 50 K (Fig. 4(a), cases E = 0.02  ·  107 V/cm and E = 0.1  ·  107 V/cm). As the proton is located in the outer state [formula] for E > Ethresh (corresponding to P = 1 for T  →  0), the dominant effect of T in this case is the the disorder-induced proton redistribution between all sites in the chain leading to the lowering of total polarization (Fig. 4(a), cases E = 0.2  ·  107 V/cm and E = 0.3  ·  107 V/cm). The profiles of the polarization for ΩR below Ω*R shown in Fig. 4(b) appear to be very similar to the high-field profiles in Fig. 4(a). Since for ΩR  <  Ω*R the proton is located in the outer states ([\ref=outer]) near the chain boundary already at low E, the increase of T suppresses the polarization due to the increasing proton disorder.

ROLE OF PROTON-PROTON CORRELATIONS

In order to examine the influence of proton correlations, we consider next the translocation of two excess protons in the wire which is described by the part H2 of the total energy ([\ref=ham_decomp]). Since the presence of two protons in wire may lead to the formation of Bjerrum D-defect, the energy H2 for the chain with N = 2 H-bonds given by the expression ([\ref=ham22]), contains the terms with the energy U of the repulsion between two nearest-neighboring protons.

Analogously to the 1-proton wire, we analyze first the behavior of the chain without the electric field. For N = 2 and ΩT  ≈  0 the energy levels found from ([\ref=ham22]) have the following form:

[formula]

and correspond to the following states of the wire:

[formula]

with [formula].

To study the influence of ΩR, we analyze ([\ref=U-levels]) and ([\ref=U-states]) for E = 0 assuming J  ≫  U and neglecting in this way by the formation of ionic defects described by the configuration |9〉 = |0110〉. Similarly to the 1-proton wire, the two different regimes can exist in the system depending on the value of the reorientation energy. In the first small-ΩR regime (for [formula]), each proton is located near the outer molecular group and the state |8〉 = |1001〉 has the lowest energy λ3  =  Δ. As ΩR increases and approaches the "critical" value Ω* (2)R, the transition to the large-ΩR regime occurs. In this regime (for ΩR  >  Ω* (2)R) the lowest energy levels [formula] (q = q+(E = 0) = q-(E = 0)) correspond to the states |〉 and |〉 in ([\ref=U-states]), with one proton located in the interior of the wire. However, in contrast to section [\ref=1-prot], the transition between these two regimes is U-dependent, because Ω* (2)R contains the energy of the D-defect U. Fig. 5(a) shows the variation of the proton occupation numbers 〈nlν〉 with ΩR for U = 9.4 kcal/mol and U = 1.9 kcal/mol (plotted in the inset). The "critical" value Ω* (2)R  ≈  3 kcal/mol for the repulsion energy U = 9.4 kcal/mol is larger as compared with Ω* (2)R  ≈  1.5 kcal/mol for U = 1.9 kcal/mol. So far as the repulsion energy U is significant, Ω* (2)R  >  Ω*R. However, as U  →  0, Ω* (2)R approaches the "critical" value Ω*R for the one-proton case . As we can see from ([\ref=U-states]) and ([\ref=sp2]), the ground states |〉 and |〉 in the large-ΩR regime are represented by the superpositions of the normal configurations |7〉 and |10〉 and the states |6〉 and |11〉 containing the D-defect. Thus the transition to the large-ΩR regime stabilize D-defects inside the chain. The formation of the D-defect states is clearly observed in Fig. 5(a) where the occupation numbers of the D-defect states |6〉 and |11〉 significantly increase for ΩR  >  Ω* (2)R.

Analogously to the one-proton case, the temperature fluctuations lead to the slight temperature-induced increase of the value Ω* (2)R(T) (corresponding to [formula]), as compared to Ω* (2)R where the states |〉 and |〉 are already stabilized. In fact, for ΩR  >  Ω* (2)R(T) the states corresponding to protonated chains with significant concentration of D-defects prevail ([formula]), whereas the states with the protons located at the boundaries in the surrounding dominate for ΩR  <  Ω* (2)R(T) ([formula]). For small ΩR  ≪  U, Ω* (2)R can be given by

[formula]

Since the line Ω* (2)R(T) found from ([\ref=omr*2_t]), is tilted with respect to T in the state diagrams (T, Ω* (2)R(T)) (Fig. 5(b)), the effect of temperature for the chain in the large-ΩR regime is crucial: with the increasing T, the temperature fluctuations can destroy the D-defects and redistribute the proton charge between the other chain sites. See for example the case of Ω* (2)R(T) = 3 kcal/mol and U = 9.4 kcal/mol plotted in Fig. 5(b) where the D-defects annihilate at T  ≈  100 K.

As U  →    ∞  , the weight constants for the D-defect states in ([\ref=U-states]) become smaller: [formula]. Thus, the contribution of the D-defect-states to the stable wire configuration goes down as [formula] for the stronger proton repulsion U (see for the comparison 〈n6〉  =  〈n11〉 for different U plotted in Fig. 5(a)).

The fact that the variation of temperature can lead to formation or annihilation of the D-defects is also observed in the T-dependence of the proton polarization. Note that especially for weak external field E, the behavior of P(T) in the small-ΩR (Fig. 6(a), E = 0.4  ·  107V / cm) and in the large-ΩR regime (Fig. 6(b), E = 0.1  ·  107V / cm) is drastically different. In the first case, at low T, the predominantly occupied symmetric ground state [formula] has the total polarization P = 0. However, with T increasing, protons tend to occupy the excited states with non-symmetric charge distribution that results in an increase of P. Fig. 7(a) demonstrates that the population of all excited states, in particular those containing D-defects (Fig. 7(a), inset), grows with T. Although the concentration of the D-defect states |0011〉 and |1100〉 is of 3-4 orders lower than that of the normal states (see Fig. 7(a), inset), it significantly increases up to 1-2 orders with the temperature increase from 50 to 300 K.

In contrast to this, in the large-ΩR regime the protons and stable D-defects migrate in the direction of applied field E for T  →  0 giving a non-zero P (Fig. 6(b)). As T increases, the population of the excited non-defect state with the protons redistributed at the boundaries grows (see Fig. 7(b)) which gives the lower chain polarization. The D-defects, located near the end of the chain for finite E (|0011〉), are redistributed between another chain positions with T, which is observed in Fig. 7(b) showing a decrease of |0011〉- together with a slight increase of the |1100〉-state population at T = 300 K as compared to lower temperatures.

We study now the electric field effect in correlated chains. Fig. 8 shows the variation of polarization and redistribution of protons with increasing E. Consider first the small-ΩR regime. In distinct to the 1-proton wire, where the polarization increases smoothly to its maximal value Pmax (Fig. 3(a), inset), we observe here two different threshold effects. The first transition from the state |8〉 of ([\ref=sp2])(the ground state of the wire in the small-ΩR regime at E = 0) to the state |10〉 (where both of the protons are ordered in the right position of each H-bond in the direction of the field) occurs at the threshold field value

[formula]

The distribution of the occupation probabilities 〈n8〉 and 〈n10〉 for the states |8〉 and |10〉 is plotted in Fig. 8(b). We observe at E = E1 the abrupt increase of 〈n10〉, while at the same field value 〈n8〉 drops to zero. Furthermore, we conclude from ([\ref=E1]) that the value E1 lowers with the number N of the water molecules in the chain. This effect can be observed in Fig. 9 where the jumps of the polarization are plotted for different N. Finally, for very long water chain (N  →    ∞  ) E1  →  0. In contrast to the strong N-dependence of E1, the second threshold effect appears at

[formula]

essentially due to the proton correlations and does not depend on the chain length. The strong increase of P at E = E2 shown in Fig. 8(a) and Fig. 9 is related to the second drastic redistribution of the proton charge in the wire. As can be observed in Fig. 8(b), at E = E2 the occupation probability 〈n11〉 of the D-defect-state |11〉 drastically increases to 1, whereas 〈n10〉 drops to zero. Thus, as resulted from our model, the formation of D-defect in external electric field has a step-like character proceeding via the threshold mechanism. In the large-ΩR regime, where the protons are stabilized at the inner water molecules already at E = 0, the first threshold phenomenon at E = E1, observed for the small-ΩR case, does not occur. However, the transition at E = E2 with the increase of the D-defect concentration appears in this regime similarly to the regime of small ΩR, that can be observed in the P-profile for ΩR = 3 kcal/mol shown in Fig. 8(a). Note that the effect of the increasing double occupancy due to membrane potentials has been observed in the current/concentration plots in gramicidin channels [\cite=phillips], thus supporting our main conclusions about the role of the external electric field.

The discussed above formation of the D-defects for ΩR  >  Ω*R in the high electric field results in the increase of P for lower temperatures as shown in Fig. 6(b). Basically, the essential effect of T observed in the P(T)-profiles in Fig. 6, is the suppression of the total polarization due to proton disorder. However, the shapes of the polarization in Fig. 6(a) are drastically different for E < E1 and E > E2. For low fields (E < E1) the polarization first increases (reflecting the fluctuation-induced expansion of proton charge from the outer symmetric positions [formula] with P = 0 to the inner positions of the chain accompanied by the formation/annihilation of D-defects), and then smoothly decreases due to the disorder effect. In contrast to this, as the increasing electric field induces the step-like formation of D-defects in the small-ΩR regime, the temperature behavior of P in this case is similar to the the large-ΩR case (compare Fig. 6(a) and Fig. 6(b) with E = 1  ·  107 V/cm) showing the smooth disorder-induced decrease of P with T.

We also note that the stable configurations with double proton occupancy require the additional reorientation steps for the proton translocation and can result in the smaller values for the proton conductivity. This fact has been observed in the measurements of the proton conductance in two different stereoisomers of the gramicidin [\cite=cukierman], thus supporting a possibility of stabilization of the D-defect states in proton wires.

SUMMARY

In this work we studied the process of proton translocation in 1D-chains mimicking protonated water channels embedded in surrounding. We have analyzed the role of the reorientation motion of protons, as well as the effect of electric field and proton correlations on the chain dynamics. We have shown that the increase of the reorientation energy results in the transition to the large-ΩR regime characterized by the transfer of the proton charge from the surrounding to the inner water molecules in the chain. The process of proton migration along the chain in the external electric field has the step-like character leading to the appearance of the electric field threshold-type phenomena with drastic redistribution of proton charge. The correlations between protons in the chain increase the "critical" reorientation energy Ω*R necessary for the transition into the large-ΩR regime, where the protonated chain contains a finite concentration of Bjerrum defects. The temperature fluctuations induce a slight increase of Ω*R(T) separating the state with the protons located in surrounding near the outer groups, and the protonated state with D-defects. For the correlated chains, this temperature dependence of the "critical" reorientation energy can lead to the redistribution of proton charge and annihilation of D-defects with increasing T. The electric field applied to the correlated chains induces first the formation of ordered dipole structures for the lower E values, and than, with the further E increase, the stabilization of the states with the Bjerrum D-defects.

Generally, the increase of temperature suppresses the total polarization in the chain due to the increasing disorder. However, especially in the low electric fields, the shapes of the temperature profiles of the polarization appear to be drastically different in the small- and large-ΩR regimes demonstrating the complex interplay between the reorientation energy and temperature.

Finally, as follows from our analysis, the following factors strongly influence the formation of Bjerrum defects: (i) the high electric fields can form the defects and pump them in the chain in the direction of field; (ii) the increase of the orientational energy barrier leads to the stabilization of D-defects; (iii) the increase of temperature in the large-ΩR regime results in the formation/annihilation of D-defects, whereas for small ΩR the concentration of D-defects significantly increases up to 1-2 orders at the room temperatures as compared to the low T  ≈  50 K.

We demonstrate below the procedure of the mapping in the system with N = 2 H-bonds on the multi-site states. For N = 2 the basis |i〉 includes 22N = 16 states |n1a,n1b,n2a,n2b〉:

[formula]

We can derive the relations between cl,ν and Xii' = |i〉〈i'|:

[formula]

where the expectation numbers 〈i|cl,ν|j〉 can be found using the usual antisymmetric rules for Fermi-operators [\cite=davydov]. Specifically, for the case N = 2 the expressions ([\ref=ferm_hubb]) yield:

[formula]

Using the relations ([\ref=c22]) and the fact that Xii'Xll'  =  δi'lXil' (due to the orthogonality of the states |i〉), we decompose ([\ref=h_t]-[\ref=h_e]) in terms of Xii' operators into the following 5 terms:

[formula]

where

[formula]

Since the parameter

[formula]

in ([\ref=ham21])-([\ref=ham23]) is the difference between proton configuration energies at the boundary (l = 1 or l = N + 1 surrounding molecular groups), and at the inner (2 < l < N) water molecule, it describes, in fact, the energy barrier for the protonation of the water chain. For our analysis Δ has the key importance, because the other energy constants in ([\ref=ham21])-([\ref=ham23])

[formula]

which appear due to the boundary effects, are independent of the proton location in the wire and thus do not influence the statistical characteristics like ([\ref=pp]).

By the similar way the energy ([\ref=h_t]-[\ref=h_e]) can be rewritten for the systems with any finite value of N.
