Introduction

Let G be a connected complex semisimple Lie group and Q a parabolic subgroup. We refer to Z  =  G / Q as a complex flag manifold. Write [formula] and [formula] for the respective Lie algebras of G and Q. Then Q is the G-normalizer of [formula]. Thus we can view Z as the set of G-conjugates of [formula]. The correspondence is [formula] where [formula] is the Lie algebra of the isotropy subgroup Qz of G at z.

Let G0 be a real form of G, and let [formula] denote its Lie algebra. Thus there is a homomorphism φ:G0  →  G such that φ(G0) is closed in G and [formula] is an isomorphism onto a real form of [formula]. This gives the action of G0 on Z.

It is well known [\cite=W0] that there are only finitely many G0-orbits on Z. Therefore at least one of them must be open.

Consider a Cartan involution θ of G0 and extend it as usual to G, [formula] and [formula]. Thus the fixed point set K0  =  Gθ0 is a maximal compactly embedded subgroup of G0 and K  =  Gθ is its complexification. This leads to Iwasawa decompositions G0  =  K0A0N0 .

By Iwasawa-Borel subgroup of G we mean a Borel subgroup B  ⊂  G such that φ(A0N0)  ⊂  B for some Iwasawa G0  =  K0A0N0 . Those are the Borel subgroups of the form B  =  BMAN, where N is the complexification of N0, A is the complexification of A0, M  =  ZK(A) is the complexification of M0 , and BM is a Borel subgroup of M. Since any two Iwasawa decompositions of G0 are G0-conjugate, and any two Borel subgroups of M are M0-conjugate because φ(M0) is compact, it follows that any two Iwasawa-Borel subgroups of G are G0-conjugate.

Given an Iwasawa-Borel subgroup B  ⊂  G, we study the Schubert varieties [formula], where O is a B-orbit on Z. We extend the theory [\cite=H] of Schubert slices from the open G0-orbits to arbitrary G0-orbits. As a main application we show that the corresponding Schubert domain ΩS(D) for an open G0-orbit D  ⊂  Z is equal to the linear cycle space ΩW(D) considered in [\cite=W1]. That yields a direct proof that the ΩW(D) are Stein manifolds. Another consequence is one of the two key containments for the complete description of linear cycle spaces when G0 is of hermitian type (Section [\ref=Hermitian] and [\cite=WZ2]). The identification ΩW(D) = ΩS(D) also plays an essential role in the subsequently proved identification of ΩW(D) with the universally defined domain ΩAG [\cite=FH].

Our main technical results (Theorem [\ref=schubert-slices] and Corollary [\ref=special-slice]), which can be viewed as being of a complex analytic nature, provide detailed information on the q-convexity of D and the Cauchy-Riemann geometry of the lower-dimensional G0-orbits.

We thank the referee for pointing out an error in our original argument for the existence of supporting incidence hypersurfaces at boundary points of the cycle space. This is rectified in Section [\ref=support] below.

Duality

We will need a refinement of Matsuki's (G0,K)-orbit duality [\cite=M]. Write Orb(G0) for the set of G0-orbits in Z, and similarly write Orb(K) for the set of all K-orbits. A pair (γ,κ)∈Orb(G0)  ×  Orb(K) is dual or satisfies duality if [formula] contains an isolated K0-orbit. The duality theorem states that

[formula]

Furthermore,

[formula]

Moreover, if (γ,κ) is dual, then the intersection [formula] is transversal: if [formula], then the real tangent spaces satisfy

[formula]

We will also need a certain "non-isolation" property:

[formula]

The basic duality ([\ref=mat_dual]) is in [\cite=M], and the refinements ([\ref=characterization]) and ([\ref=transversal]) are given by the moment map approach ([\cite=MUV], [\cite=BL]). See [\cite=BL].

The non-isolation property ([\ref=non-isolation]) is implicitly contained in the moment map considerations of [\cite=MUV] and [\cite=BL]. Following [\cite=BL], the two essential ingredients are the following.

Endow Z with a Gu-invariant Kähler metric, e.g., from the negative of the Killing form of [formula] . Here Gu is the compact real form of G denoted U in [\cite=BL]. The K0-invariant gradient field [formula] of the norm function f+: = ||μK0||2 of the moment map for the K0-action on Z, determined by the Gu-invariant metric, is tangent to both the G0- and K-orbits.

A pair (γ,κ) satisfies duality if and only if their intersection is non-empty and contains a point of [formula].

If the pair does not satisfy duality, [formula], g = g(t) is the 1-parameter group associated to [formula] and ε > 0 is sufficiently small, then

[formula]

is the desired submanifold. For this it is only important to note that [formula] does not vanish along, and is nowhere tangent to, K0(p). That completes the argument.

Dual pairs have a retraction property, which we prove using the moment map approach.

Let (γ,κ) be a dual pair. Fix [formula]. Then the intersection [formula] is a K0-equivariant strong deformation retract of γ.

Proof. We use the notation of [\cite=BL]. If φ(t,x) is the flow of [formula], then it follows that, if x∈γ and t > 0, then φ(t,x)∈γ. Furthermore, the limiting set π+(x) =  lim t  →    ∞  φ(t,x) is contained in the intersection K0(z0).

Let U be a K0-slice neighborhood of K0(z0) in γ. In other words, if (K0)z0 denotes the isotropy subgroup of K0 at z0, then there is a (K0)z0-invariant open ball B in the normal space Nz0(K0(z0)) such that U is the (K0)z0-homogeneous fiber space K0  ×  (K0)z0B over B. The isotropy group (K0)z0 is minimal over U in that, given z∈U, it is K0-conjugate to a subgroup of (K0)z.

The flow φ(t,  ·  ) is K0-equivariant. Thus, since π+(x)  ⊂  K0.z0 for every x∈γ, every orbit K0.z in γ is equivariantly diffeomorphic, via some φ(t0,  ·  ), to a K0-orbit in U. Consequently, K0(z0) is minimal in γ.

The Mostow fibration of γ is a K0-equivariant vector bundle with total space γ and base space that is a minimal K0-orbit in γ. In other words the base space is K0(z0). Any such vector bundle is K0-equivariantly retractable to its 0-section. We may take that 0-section to be K0(z0). [formula]

Every open G0-orbit in Z is simply-connected. In particular the isotropy groups of G0 on an open orbit are connected.

Corollary [\ref=retract-open-orbit] was proved by other methods in [\cite=W0]. In that open orbit case of Theorem [\ref=retract-any-orbit], κ is the base cycle, maximal compact subvariety of γ.

Incidence divisors associated to Schubert varieties

Fix an open G0-orbit D  ⊂  Z. Its dual is the unique closed K-orbit C0 contained in D. Denote [formula] . Write Cq(Z) for the variety of q-dimensional cycles in Z. As a subset of Z, the complex group orbit G  ·  C0 is Zariski open in its closure.

At this point, for simplicity of exposition we assume that [formula] is simple. This entails no loss of generality because all our flags, groups, orbits, cycles, etc. decompose as products according to the decomposition of [formula] as a direct sum of simple ideals.

In two isolated instances of (G0,Z) (see [\cite=W2]), C0  =  Z and the orbit G  ·  C0 consists of a single point. If G0 is of hermitian type and D is an open G0-orbit of "holomorphic type" in the terminology of [\cite=WZ1], then G  ·  C0 is the compact hermitian symmetric space dual to the bounded symmetric domain B. This case is completely understood ([\cite=W1], [\cite=WZ1]). In these two cases we set Ω: = G  ·  C0 . Here Ω is canonically identified as a coset space of G, because the G-stabilizer of C0 is its own normalizer in G.

Except in the two cases just mentioned, the G-stabilizer [formula] of C0 has identity component K, and there is a canonical finite equivariant map [formula]. Here we set Ω = G / K. Its base point is the coset K.

Suppose that Y is a complex analytic subset of Z. Then [formula] is a closed complex variety in Ω [\cite=BM], called the incidence variety associated to Y. For purposes of comparison we work with the preimage π- 1(AY) in Ω. From now on we abuse notation: we write [formula]. If AY is purely of codimension 1 then we refer to it as the incidence divisor associated to Y and denote it by HY .

Now suppose that the complex analytic subset Y is a Schubert variety defined by an Iwasawa-Borel subgroup B  ⊂  G. Thus Y is the closure of one or more orbits of B on Z. Then the incidence variety AY is B-invariant, because Ω and Y are B-invariant. Define Y(D) to be the set of all Iwasawa-Schubert varieties Y  ⊂  Z such that [formula]   and AY is a hypersurface HY . Then we define the Schubert domain ΩS(D):

[formula]

See [\cite=HS] and [\cite=H]. Note that any two Iwasawa-Borel subgroups are conjugate by an element of K0. Thus

where [formula] is the union of the incidence hypersurfaces defined by the Schubert varieties in the complement of D of a fixed Iwasawa-Borel subgroup. Thus ΩS(D) is an open subset of Ω, and of course it is G0-invariant by construction.

In Corollary [\ref=wolf=schubert] we will show that the cycle space ΩW(D) (see ([\ref=def_cyclespace])) agrees with ΩS(D). Consequently, it has the same analytic properties. For example we now check that ΩS(D) is a Stein domain.

In order to prove that ΩS(D) is Stein, it suffices to show that it is contained in a Stein subdomain [formula] of Ω. For then, given a boundary point [formula] in [formula], it will be contained in a complex hypersurface H that is equal to or a limit of incidence divisors HY . Now [formula] is in the complement of D and will be the polar set of a meromorphic function on [formula]. So ΩS(D) will be a domain of holomorphy in the Stein subdomain [formula], and will therefore be Stein.

As mentioned above, there are three possibilities for Ω. If C0 = Z, then Ω is reduced to a point, and ΩS(D) is Stein in a trivial way. Now suppose [formula]. Then either Ω is a compact hermitian symmetric space G / KP- or it is the affine variety G / K. In the latter case Ω is Stein, so ΩS(D) is Stein. Now we are down to the case where Ω  =  G / KP-  is an irreducible compact hermitian symmetric space. In particular the second Betti number b2(Ω) = 1. Therefore the divisor of every complex hypersurface in Ω is ample. For Y∈Y(D) this implies that [formula] is affine. Since [formula] and [formula], this implies that ΩS(D) is Stein in this case as well. Therefore we have proved

If D is an open G0-orbit in the complex flag manifold Z, then the associated Schubert domain ΩS(D) is Stein.

Schubert varieties associated to dual pairs

Fix an Iwasawa decomposition G0  =  K0A0N0 . Let B be a corresponding Iwasawa-Borel subgroup of G; in other words A0N0  ⊂  B. Fix a K-orbit κ on Z and let Sκ denote the set of all Schubert varieties S defined by B (that is, S is the closure of a B-orbit on Z) such that dim S  +   dim κ  =   dim Z and [formula]. The Schubert varieties generate the integral homology of Z. Hence Sκ is determined by the topological class of [formula].

Let (γ,κ)∈Orb(G0)  ×  Orb(K) satisfy duality. Then the following hold for every S∈Sκ .

[formula] is contained in [formula] and is finite. If [formula], then (AN)(w)  =  B(w)  =  O where [formula], and S is transversal to κ at w in the sense that the real tangent spaces satisfy [formula].

The set Σ  =  Σ(γ,S,w): = A0N0(w) is open in S and closed in γ.

Let c[formula] and c[formula] denote closures in Z. Then the map [formula], given by (k,z)  ↦  k(z), is surjective.

Proof. Let [formula]. Since [formula], complexification of the Lie algebra version [formula] of G0  =  K0A0N0 , we have Tw(AN(w))  +  Tw(K(w))  =  Tw(Z). As [formula] and AN  ⊂  B, we have [formula]. Furthermore [formula]. Thus [formula]. If w were not in κ, this inequality would be strict, in violation of the above additivity of the dimensions of the tangent spaces. Thus w∈κ and Tw(S)  +  Tw(κ)  =  Tw(Z). Since dim S  +   dim κ  =   dim Z this sum is direct, i.e., [formula]. Now also dim AN(w)  =   dim S and dim K(w)  =   dim κ. Thus AN(w) is open in S, forcing AN(w)  =  B(w)  =  O. We have already seen that K(w) is open in κ, forcing K(w)  =  κ. For assertion 1 it remains only to show that [formula] is contained in γ and is finite.

Denote   =  G0(w). If   ≠  γ, then (,κ) is not dual, but [formula] is nonempty because it contains w. By the non-isolation property ([\ref=non-isolation]), we have a locally closed K0-invariant manifold [formula] such that dim M  =   dim K0(w) + 1. We know [formula], and K(w)  =  κ, so [formula]. Thus Tw(A0N0(w))  +  Tw(K0(w)) has codimension 1 in the subspace Tw(A0N0(w))  +  Tw(M) of Tw(), which contradicts G0  =  K0A0N0 . We have proved that [formula]. Since that intersection is transversal at w, it is finite. This completes the proof of assertion 1.

We have seen that [formula], so [formula], and G0(w)  =  γ. With the characterization ([\ref=characterization]) and the transversality conditions ([\ref=transversal]) for duality we have [formula]. Now A0N0(w) is open in S, .

Every A0N0-orbit in γ meets K0(w), because γ  =  G0(w)  =  A0N0K0(w). Using ([\ref=transversal]), every such A0N0-orbit has dimension at least that of Σ  =  A0N0(w). Since the orbits on the boundary of Σ in γ would necessarily be smaller, it follows that Σ is closed in γ. This completes the proof of assertion 2.

The map K0  ×  Σ  →  γ, by (k,z)  ↦  k(z), is surjective because K0A0N0(w)  =  γ. Since K0 is compact and γ is dense in [formula], assertion 3 follows. [formula]

We now apply Theorem [\ref=schubert-slices] to construct an Iwasawa-Schubert variety Y of codimension q + 1 , q  =   dim C0 , which contains a given point [formula] and which is contained in [formula]. Due to the presence of the large family of q-dimensional cycles in D, one could not hope to construct larger varieties with these properties.

Before going into the construction, let us introduce some convenient notation and mention several preliminary facts.

We say that a point [formula] is generic, written [formula], if γp: = G0(p) is open in [formula]. This is equivalent to γp being an isolated orbit in [formula] in the sense that no other G0-orbit in [formula] has γp in its closure. Clearly [formula] is open and dense in [formula].

Given [formula] the orbit γ  =  γp need not be a real hypersurface in Z. For example, [formula] has exactly two orbits in [formula], an open orbit and its complement [formula]. Nevertheless, for any z in such an orbit γ it follows that [formula] near z. If κ is dual to γ, then, since the intersection [formula] is transversal in Z, it follows that [formula].

We summarize this as follows.

For [formula], γ  =  γp  =  G0(p) and κ dual to γ, it follows that [formula]. Furthermore, if C0 is the base cycle in D, then

Proof. The property [formula] has been verified above. For the dimension estimate note that C0 is dimension-theoretically a minimal K0-orbit in D, e.g., the K0-orbits in [formula] are at least of its dimension. Since κ is not compact, it follows that dim  κ  >   dim  C0 . [formula]

We will also make use of the following basic fact about Schubert varieties.

Let B be a Borel subgroup of G, let S be a k-dimensional B-Schubert variety in Z, and suppose that [formula]. Then there exists a B-Schubert variety S' with [formula] and S'  ⊃  S.

Proof. We may assume that S  ≠  Z. Let O be the open B-orbit in S and O' be a B-orbit of minimal dimension among those orbits with c[formula].

For p∈O it follows that c[formula] near p. Since O' is affine, it then follows that dim  O'  =  ( dim  O) + 1. Applying this argument recursively, we find Schubert varieties [formula] of every intermediate dimension [formula]. [formula]

We now come to our main application of Theorem [\ref=schubert-slices].

Let D be an open G0-orbit on Z and fix a boundary point [formula]. Then there exist an Iwasawa decomposition G0  =  K0A0N0 , an Iwasawa-Borel subgroup B  ⊃  A0N0 , and a B-Schubert variety Y, such that (1) [formula], (2) codimZY  =  q + 1, and (3) AY is a B-invariant analytic subvariety of Ω.

Proof. Let [formula], let γ  =  γp , and let κ be dual to γ. First consider the case where [formula]. From Lemma [\ref=kappa_dimension], codim[formula] for every S∈Sκ.

Now, given S∈Sκ, further specify p to be in [formula] and let Y be a (q + 1)-codimensional Schubert variety containing S (see Lemma [\ref=increasing_size_of_S]).

Since [formula] and [formula], if [formula], then there would be a point of intersection [formula] . Since A0N0(z)  ⊂  Y, it would follow that Thus Y does not meet D. On the other hand, using Theorem [\ref=schubert-slices], it meets every G0-orbit in c[formula]. Thus, by conjugating appropriately, we have the desired result for any point in the closure of γ. Since γ was chosen to be an arbitrary isolated orbit in bd(D), the result follows for every point of bd(D). [formula]

Supporting hypersurfaces at the cycle space boundary

Let D  =  G0(z0) be an open G0-orbit on Z. Let C0 denote the base cycle K0(z0)  =  K(z0) in D, i.e., the dual K-orbit κ to the open G0-orbit γ = D. Then the cycle space of D is given by

[formula]

Since D is open and C0 is compact, the cycle space ΩW(D) initially sits as an open submanifold of the complex homogeneous space [formula], where [formula] is the isotropy subgroup of G at C0 . In the Appendix, Section [\ref=lifting], we will see (with the few Hermitian exceptions which have already been mentioned) that the finite covering [formula] restricts to an equivariant biholomorphic diffeomorphism of the lifted cycle space

[formula]

onto ΩW(D).

The main goal of the present section is, given [formula], to determine a particular point p∈C which is contained in a Iwasawa-Schubert variety Y with codimZY = q + 1, so that [formula], and AY  =  HY  is of pure codimension 1. It is then an immediate consequence (see Corollary [\ref=wolf=schubert]) that ΩW(D) = ΩS(D).

Given [formula], we consider Iwasawa-Schubert varieties [formula] of minimal possible dimension that satisfy the following conditions:

[formula]

[formula]

The union of the irreducible components of E that contain p is itself contained in [formula].

Notation: Let A denote the union of all the irreducible components of E contained in [formula] and let B denote the union of the remaining components of E. In particular [formula].

Note that by starting with the Schubert variety S0: = Y as in the proof of Corollary [\ref=special-slice], and by considering a chain [formula] with dim   Si + 1  =   dim   Si + 1 , we eventually come to a Schubert variety S = Sk with these properties. Of course, given p, the Schubert variety S may not be unique, but [formula].

The following Proposition gives a constructive method for determining an Iwasawa-Borel invariant incidence hypersurface that contains C and is itself contained in the complement [formula]. Here S is constructed as above.

If δ > 0, then [formula].

Given Proposition [\ref=lowering_dimension], take a point [formula] and replace S by a component S1 of B that contains p1 . Possibly there are components of [formula] that contain p1 and also have non-empty intersection with D. If that is the case, we replace S1 by any such component. Since this S1 still has non-empty intersection with the Iwasawa-Borel invariant A, at least some of the components of its E1 do not intersect in this way. Continuing in this way, we eventually determine an S1 that satisfies all of the above conditions at p1. The procedure stops because Schubert varieties of dimension less than n - q have empty intersection with D.

If S0 satisfies the above conditions at p0, then there exist [formula] and a Schubert subvariety S1  ⊂  S0 that satisfies these conditions at p1 and has dimension n - q.

Proof. We recursively apply the procedure indicated above until δ = 0. [formula]

If [formula], there exists an Iwasawa-Schubert variety S of dimension n - q such that [formula] has non-empty intersection with C.

Let [formula]. Then there exists an Iwasawa-Borel subgroup B  ⊂  G, and a component HE of a B-invariant incidence variety AE, where [formula] as above, such that [formula], C∈HE , and [formula], i.e., HE is an incidence divisor.

Proof. The hypersurface E in S is the support of an ample divisor [\cite=HS]. Thus the trace-transform method ([\cite=BK], see also [\cite=HS]) produces a meromorphic function on Ω with a pole at C and polar set contained in AE. Hence AE has a component HE as required. [formula]

In the language of Section [\ref=def_schu] this shows that for every [formula] there exists Y∈Y(D) such that C∈HY . In other words, every such boundary point is contained in the complement of the Schubert domain ΩS(D). By definition ΩW(D)  ⊂  ΩS(D) . Using that, the equality of these domains follows immediately:

ΩW(D) = ΩS(D).

Let us now turn to certain technical preparations for the proof of Proposition [\ref=lowering_dimension]. For S as in its statement, let US be its preimage in the universal family U parameterized by Ω. The mapping π:US  →  Ω is proper and surjective and the fiber π- 1(C) over a point C∈Ω can be identified with [formula]. All orbits of the Iwasawa-Borel group that defines S are transversal to the base cycle C0 ; in particular, [formula] is pure-dimensional with [formula]. Thus the generic cycle in Ω has this property.

Choose a 1-dimensional (local) disk Δ in Ω with C corresponding to its origin, such that Iz: = π- 1(z) is δ-dimensional for [formula]. Define X to be the closure of [formula] in US. The map [formula] is proper and its fibers are purely δ-dimensional.

In the sequel we use the standard moving lemma of intersection theory and argue using a desingularization [formula], where only points E are blown up. Let [formula], [formula] and [formula] denote the corresponding [formula]-preimages. By taking Δ in generic position we may assume that for [formula] no component of Iz is contained in E. Hence we may lift the family X  →  Δ to a family [formula] of δ-dimensional varieties such that [formula] is finite to one outside of the fiber over 0∈Δ. Let [formula] denote the fiber of [formula] at z∈Δ, and shrink [formula] so that [formula] is connected. Since [formula] for [formula], it follows that the intersection class [formula] in the homology of [formula] is zero.

An irreducible component of [formula] is one of the following types: it intersects [formula] but not [formula], or it intersects both [formula] and [formula], or it intersects [formula] but not [formula]. Write [formula] correspondingly.

[formula].

Proof. Since [formula], it is enough to consider the case where [formula]. Let H be a hyperplane section in Z with [formula] (see e.g. [\cite=HS]) and put H in a continuous family Ht of hyperplanes with H0  =  H such that [formula] is (δ - 1)-dimensional for [formula] and such that the lift [formula] of [formula] contains no irreducible component of [formula]. In particular, [formula] for [formula]. Since [formula], it follows that [formula]. But [formula] and therefore [formula]. [formula]

Proof of Proposition [\ref=lowering_dimension]. We first consider the case where [formula]. Since [formula], it follows that some irreducible component I' of I has non-empty intersection with both A and B. Of course [formula]. But E is the support of a hyperplane section, and since [formula], it follows that [formula] is connected. In particular [formula] meets [formula]. Therefore [formula] and consequently [formula].

Now suppose that δ = 1, i.e., that [formula] is 1-dimensional. Since [formula], the (non-empty) intersection [formula] is not discrete. We will show that some component of [formula] is contained in [formula]. It will follow immediately that [formula]. For this we assume to the contrary that every component of [formula] which is contained in [formula] is in [formula] . We decompose [formula] , where [formula] consists of those components of [formula] which are contained in [formula] and [formula] of those which have discrete or empty intersection with [formula].

Now [formula]. Choosing Ht as above, we have [formula] for [formula]. If [formula], then [formula]. This would contradict [formula]. Thus [formula] and [formula]. But [formula] and [formula] are disjoint, contrary to [formula] being connected. Thus it follows that [formula] does indeed contain a component that is contained in [formula]. The proof is complete.[formula]

Intersection properties of Schubert slices

Let (γ,κ) be a dual pair and [formula]. Let Σ be the Schubert slice at z0 , i.e., Σ  =  A0N0(z0)  ⊂  γ. In particular [formula]. We take a close look at the intersection set [formula].

Let L0 denote the isotropy subgroup (G0)z0, and therefore [formula] and [formula] . Define α:(K0)z0  ×  (A0N0)z0  →  L0 by group multiplication.

The map α:(K0)z0  ×  (A0N0)z0  →  L0 is a diffeomorphism onto an open subgroup of L0.

Proof. Since dim   K0(z0)  +   dim   (A0N0)(z0)  =   dim   G0(z0) and dim   K0  +   dim   (A0N0)  =   dim   G0 we have dim   (K0)z0  +   dim   (A0N0)z0  =   dim   L0 . Thus the orbit of the neutral point under the action of the compact group (K0)z0 is the union of certain components of L0 / (A0N0)z0, i.e., [formula] is an open subgroup of L0 .

The injectivity of α follows from the fact that G0 is the topological product G0  =  K0  ×  (A0N0). This product structure also yields the fact that (K0)z0(m) is transversal to (A0N0)z0 at every m∈(A0N0)z0 . Thus, α is a local diffeomorphism along (A0N0)z0 and by equivariance is therefore a diffeomorphism onto its image. [formula]

If L0 is connected, in particular if γ is simply connected, then [formula].

Proof. If [formula], then there exists k∈K0 and an∈A0N0 so that k- 1(z0)  =  (an)(z0), i.e., kan∈L0 . Therefore k∈(K0)z0, an∈(A0N0)z0, and z1  =  z0. [formula]

Let D be an open G0-orbit in Z, C0  ⊂  D the base cycle, z0∈C0 , and Σ  =  A0N0(z0) a Schubert slice at z0 . If C∈ΩW(D), then [formula] consists of a single point, and the intersection [formula] at that point is transversal.

Proof. Let [formula] be the Schubert variety containing Σ, and let k denote the intersection number ·  [C0]. We know from Theorem [\ref=schubert-slices] that intersection points occur only in the open A0N0-orbits in S. The open G0-orbit D is simply connected, and therefore Corollary [\ref=one-point-intersection] applies. Thus [formula]. From Theorem [\ref=schubert-slices](1) it follows that intersection this transversal. Hence it contributes exactly 1 to ·  [C0]. Now we have k different open A0N0-orbits in S, each of which contains exactly one (transversal) intersection point.

Cycles C∈ΩW(D) are homotopic to C0 . Thus ·  [C]  =  k. As we homotopy C0 to C staying in D, the intersection points of course move around, but each stays in its original open A0N0-orbits in S. Since Σ is one of those open A0N0-orbits, it follows that [formula] consists of a single point, and the intersection there is transversal, as asserted. [formula]

The domains ΩI and ΩAG

The Schubert domain ΩS(D) is defined as a certain subspace of the cycle space Ω. When G0 is of hermitian type and Ω is the associated compact hermitian symmetric space, the situation is completely understood [\cite=W1]: ΩW(D) is the bounded symmetric domain dual to Ω in the sense of symmetric spaces. Now we put that case aside. Then [formula], and we have

[formula]

Let B be an Iwasawa-Borel subgroup of G. It has only finitely many orbits on Ω, and those orbits are complex manifolds. The orbit B(1K) is open, because ANK is open in G, and its complement S  ⊂  Ω is a finite union [formula] of B-invariant irreducible complex hypersurfaces. For any given open G0-orbit, some of these Hi occur in the definition ([\ref=def_schubert_domain]) of ΩS(D). The Iwasawa domain ΩI is defined as in ([\ref=def_schubert_domain]) except that we use all the Hi :

[formula]

This definition is independent of choice of B because any two Iwasawa-Borel subgroups of G are G0-conjugate. Just as in the case of the Schubert domains, we note here that is closed. By definition, ΩI  ⊂  ΩS(D) for every open G0-orbit D in Z.

The argument for ΩS(D) also shows that ΩI is a Stein domain in Ω. See [\cite=H] for further properties of ΩI

The Iwasawa domain has been studied by several authors from a completely different viewpoint and with completely different definitions. See [\cite=B], [\cite=BLZ], [\cite=BR], [\cite=GM] and [\cite=KS]. Here is the definition in [\cite=B]. Let X0 be the closed G0-orbit in G / B and let Omax be the open K-orbit there. The polar [formula] of X0 is the connected component of 1.K in [formula].

=  ΩI .

Proof. Let π:G  →  G / K  =  Ω denote the projection. As S is the complement of B  ·  K in Ω, π- 1(ΩI) is the interior of [formula]. Note that h∈I  ⇔  g- 1h∈ANK for all g∈G0 ⇔  h- 1g∈KAN for all g∈G0 ⇔  h- 1G0  ⊂  KAN. Viewing 1B as the base point in X0 , the condition for hK being in [formula] is that h- 1G0B  ⊂  KB  =  KAN. Thus h∈I  ⇔  hK∈ , in other words [formula]. [formula]

The polar [formula] to the closed G0-orbit X0 is a Stein subdomain of Ω.

Now we turn to the domain ΩAG . The Cartan involution θ of [formula] defines the usual Cartan decomposition [formula] and the compact real form [formula] of [formula]. Let Gu be the corresponding compact real form of G, real-analytic subgroup for [formula] , acting on Ω  =  G / K. Then

[formula]

the topological component of x0  =  1K. It is important to note that the action of G0 on the Akhiezer-Gindikin domain ΩAG is proper [\cite=AG].

In work related to automorphic forms ([\cite=BR], [\cite=KS]) it was shown that ΩAG  ⊂  , when G0 is a classical group. Other related results were proved in [\cite=GM].

By means of an identification of [formula] with a certain maximal domain Ωadpt for the adapted complex structure inside the real tangent bundle of G0 / K0, and using basic properties of plurisubharmonic functions, it was shown by the first author that ΩAG  ⊂  ΩI in complete generality [\cite=H]. Barchini proved the opposite inclusion in [\cite=B]. Thus ΩAG  =  ΩI . In view of Theorem [\ref=polar-iwasawa], we now have

ΩI  =    =  ΩAG .

In particular, this gives yet another proof that ΩAG is Stein. That result was first proved in [\cite=BHH] where a plurisubharmonic exhaustion function was constructed.

Summary: In general, ΩS(D)  =  ΩW(D) and ΩI  =    =  ΩAG .

Cycle spaces of lower-dimensional G0-orbits

Let us recall the setting of [\cite=GM]. For Z = G / Q, γ∈OrbZ(G0) and κ∈OrbZ(K) its dual, let G(γ) be the connected component of the identity of [formula]. Note that G(γ) is an open K-invariant subset of G which contains the identity. Define C(γ): = G(γ) / K. Finally, define C as the intersection of all such cycle spaces as γ ranges over OrbZ(G0) and Q ranges over all parabolic subgroups of G.

C  =  ΩAG .

This result was checked in [\cite=GM] for classical and hermitian exceptional groups by means of case by case computations, and the authors of [\cite=GM] conjectured it in general. As will be shown here, it is a consequence of the statement and of the following general result [\cite=GM].

[formula].

{ Proof of Theorem. The polar [formula] in Z = G / B coincides with the cycle space CZ(γ0), where γ0 is the unique closed G0-orbit in Z. As was shown above, this agrees with the Iwasawa domain ΩI  which in turn is contained in every Schubert domain ΩS(D). Thus, for every open G0-orbit D0 in Z = G / B we have the inclusions

Intersecting over all open G0-orbits D in G / B, the equalities are forced, and C  =  ΩAG is a consequence of ΩI  =  ΩAG. [formula]

As noted in our introductory remarks, using in particular the results of the present paper, it was shown in [\cite=FH] that ΩW(D)  =  ΩAG with the obvious exceptions in the well-understood hermitian cases. This is an essentially stronger result than the above theorem on intersections. On the other hand, it required a good deal of additional work and therefore it is perhaps of interest that the intersection result follows as above in a direct way from ΩW(D) = ΩS(D). So, for example, in any particular case where this latter point was verified, the intersection theorem would be immediate (see e.g. [\cite=HW] for the case of [formula]).

Groups of hermitian type

Let G0 be of hermitian type. Write B for the bounded symmetric domain G0 / K0 with a fixed choice of invariant complex structure. Drop the colocation convention leading to ([\ref=colocation]), so that now the cycle space ΩW(D) really consists of cycles as in [\cite=W1] and [\cite=WZ1]. It has been conjectured (see [\cite=WZ1]) that, whenever D is an open G0-orbit in a complex flag manifold Z  =  G / Q, there are just two possibilities:

A certain double fibration (see [\cite=WZ1]) is holomorphic, and ΩW(D) is biholomorphic either to B or to [formula], or

both ΩW(D) and [formula] have natural biholomorphic embeddings into G / K, and there [formula] .

The first case is known ([\cite=W1], [\cite=WZ1]), and the second case has already been checked [\cite=WZ1] in the cases where G0 is a classical group.

The inclusion [formula] was proved in general ([\cite=WZ1]; or see [\cite=WZ2]). It is also known [\cite=BHH] that [formula] . Combine this with ΩAG  ⊂  ΩI ([\cite=H]; or see Theorem [\ref=i-ag]), with ΩW(D)  =  ΩS(D) (Corollary [\ref=wolf=schubert]), and with ΩI  ⊂  ΩS(D) (compare definitions ([\ref=def_schubert_domain]) and ([\ref=def_iwasawa_domain])) to see that

[formula]

Now we have proved the following result. (Also see [\cite=WZ2].)

Let G0 be a simple noncompact group of hermitian type. Then either (1) a certain double fibration (see [\cite=WZ1]) is holomorphic, and ΩW(D) is biholomorphic to B or to [formula], or (2) Ω  =  G / K and [formula].

Appendix: Lifting the cycle space to G / K

As mentioned in connection with the definitions ([\ref=def_cyclespace]) and ([\ref=def_liftedcyclespace]), we can view the cycle space ΩW(D) inside G / K because of

The projection [formula] restricts to a G0-equivariant holomorphic cover [formula], and [formula] is one to one.

We show that [formula] is homeomorphic to a cell, and then we apply [\cite=F].

Without loss of generality we may assume that G is simply connected. Let Gu denote the θ-stable compact real form of G such that [formula] , connected. Then Gu is simply connected because it is a maximal compact subgroup of the simply connected group G. It follows that Gu / K0 is simply connected. We view Gu / K0 as a riemannian symmetric space Mu , using the negative of the Killing form of Gu for metric and θ|Gu for the symmetry at 1  ·  K0 . It is connected and simply connected.

Let x0 denote the base point 1  ·  K0∈Gu / K0  =  Mu . Let L  ⊂  Tx0(Mu) denote the conjugate locus at x0 , all tangent vectors ξ at x0 such that d exp x0 is nonsingular at tξ for [formula] but singular at ξ. Then we define

[formula]

The conjugate locus L and the cut locus are the same for Mu [\cite=C], so [formula] consists of the points in Mu at a distance from x0 less than half way to exp x0(L). For example, if G0 / K0 is a bounded symmetric domain B, then a glance at the polysphere that sweeps out Mu under the action of K0 shows that [formula].

The lifted cycle space [formula]. It is G0-equivariantly diffeomorphic to (G0 / K0)  ×  Mu . In particular it is homeomorphic to a cell.

Proof. According to [\cite=FH], the lifted cycle space [formula] coincides with the Akhiezer-Gindikin domain ΩAG. The restricted root description [\cite=AG] of ΩAG is (in our notation)

[formula]

where [formula] is a maximal abelian subspace of [formula] and [formula] is the resulting family of restricted roots. A glance at Definition [\ref=half] shows that

[formula]

Thus [formula] . That is the first assertion.

For the second assertion note that [formula] fibers G0-equivariantly over G0 / K0 by gx  ↦  gK0 for g∈G0 and [formula] . For the third assertion note that G0 / K0 and [formula] are homeomorphic to cells. [formula]

Proof of Theorem. As [formula] is a cell, [formula] for q  >  0 and the Euler characteristic [formula]. Let γ be a covering transformation for [formula] and let n be its order. Then the cyclic group 〈γ〉 acts freely on [formula] and the quotient manifold [formula] has Euler characteristic [formula] [\cite=F], so n  =  1. Now the covering group of [formula] is trivial, so π is one to one. [formula]
