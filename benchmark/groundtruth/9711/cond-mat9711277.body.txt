In a recent letter to Nature, Edwards and Ashcroft[\cite=ea] made the interesting suggestion that phase III of solid molecular hydrogen be due to an electronic instability arising at a density [formula], when the pressure is about 150 GPa.

While we agree completely with the above authors that the dramatic increase in the infrared absorption together with the similar behaviours of H2 and D2 in phase III strongly suggest that for P> 150 GPa a new electronic configuration characterizes solid molecular hydrogen, we have strong reservations about their explanation in terms of a dielectric instability. And this for the following reasons: even though we may accept that in a mean field approximation the electric field at the site of a molecule is [formula] ( [formula] is the static electric dipole of the molecule), f≃5, and the energy gain per molecule due to the electrostatic interaction [formula], we have good reasons to doubt that the latter is sufficient to overcome the energy deficit necessary to bring the molecule to the electronic state of polarization that characterizes phase III.

Indeed, from the observed infrared absorbance one can determine the experimental oscillator strength of the vibron mode [\cite=mh] fexp≃1.210- 5. By its definition ( we are using natural units, where [formula])

[formula]

where e is the electron's charge, me its mass and ω the vibron frequency. Substituting the experimental numbers one thus gets,

[formula]

which gives Δes≃ - 0.07eV. On the other hand, the molecules in phase III, due to the still high gap between the conduction and the valence band, can be well represented by the quantum state (|0〉 is the ground state, whose electric dipole is zero),

[formula]

|Πu〉 being an excited state with energy E(Πu) = 12.4 eV and dipole moment [formula]cm. Thus we may write

[formula]

i.e. sin 2θ≃0.08. This implies that the energy deficit Δpol  =   sin 2θE(Πu) for polarizing the hydrogen molecules in phase III is about 1 eV, much bigger than the estimated electrostatic gain of 0.07 eV.

In a recent paper [\cite=bdpx] we have shown that no such difficulty arises when a peculiar electrodynamic instability is invoked and analysed quantitatively.
