There are plenty of important observables which are essentially given by the transversal part of the current correlators, Π(q2), with different tensorial structure. The cross section for the annihilation of e+e- to hadrons is governed by the vector current correlator. The decay rate of the Z boson as well as the production of top quarks is a combination of the vector and axial-vector correlator. For the decay rate of a scalar of pseudo-scalar Higgs boson the correlators induced by scalar, respectively, pseudo-scalar currents are important.

At one- and even at two-loop level results valid for arbitrary external momentum, q, and quark mass, m, are available for quite some time [\cite=CKKRep]. However, proceeding to three loops the situation is much more difficult. In the high energy region until recently only terms up to O(m2 / q2) were available. Our aim was to use a systematic approach which allows the computation of higher order mass corrections to the current correlators. A well-defined algorithm is provided by the so-called large momentum expansion (LMP) [\cite=Smi95]. Whereas at one- and two-loop level it is still possible to apply the LMP "by hand" for the three-loop calculation this is very painful. In the vector case, e.g., from the 18 initial diagrams altogether 240 subgraphs, which have to be expanded in their small quantities, are generated when the LMP is applied. This is barely feasible by hand. Therefore we decided to automate the LMP. Details can be found in [\cite=CheHarKueSte97].

The results of the O(α2s) corrections to Π(q2) can be separated according to the different colour factors and cast into the form:

[formula]

where Π(2)S is the contribution from the singlet diagrams which is not present in the vector case. As an example in Fig. [\ref=figv] the results for the imaginary parts of Π(2)A and Π(2)l in the case of the vector correlator are shown. They contribute at O(α2s) to the ratio R = σ(e+e-  →  ) / σ(e+e-  →  μ+μ-). The wide-dotted line corresponds to the massless corrections. The dashed lines include successively higher orders in m2 / s and finally the full curve comprises also the (m2 / s)6 contributions. The semi-analytical result [\cite=CKS] (R(2)A), respectively, the exact result [\cite=HKT] (R(2)l) is represented by narrow dots. The comparison shows that a very good approximation is obtained up to [formula].

Similar results were obtained for the axial-vector corrections [\cite=HarSte972]. This allows the computation of the cross section σ(e+e-  →  t + X) for energies [formula] GeV (corresponding to [formula] for Mt = 175 GeV) up to O(α2s). For [formula] GeV the NLO QCD corrections amount to 2%.

In [\cite=HarSte97] the first five terms of the scalar and pseudo-scalar corrections were evaluated. This immediately leads to the inclusive decay rate of a scalar or pseudo-scalar Higgs boson into top quarks. It was demonstrated that for a Higgs boson mass MH = 450 GeV the quartic corrections are still sizeable and of the same order of magnitude as the full O(α2s) corrections. The contribution from the order (m2 / s)3 and (m2 / s)4 terms are small and confirm the validity of the expansion.
