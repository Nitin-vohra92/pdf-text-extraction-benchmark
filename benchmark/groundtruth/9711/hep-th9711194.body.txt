ABSTRACT

In the theory of quantum cohomologies the WDVV equations imply integrability of the system (I∂μ  -  zCμ)ψ  =  0. However, in generic situation - of which an example is provided by the Seiberg-Witten theory - there is no distinguished direction (like t0) in the moduli space, and such equations for ψ appear inconsistent. Instead they are substituted by (Cμ∂ν  -  Cν∂μ)ψ  ~  (Fμ∂ν  -  Fν∂μ)ψ  =  0, where matrices (Fμ)αβ  =  ∂α∂β∂μF.

Quantum Cohomologies (a brief summary)

The WDVV (Witten-Dijkgraaf-Verlinde-Verlinde) equations [\cite=WDVV] are an important ingredient of the theory of quantum cohomologies (2d topological σ-models) and play a role in the formulation of mirror transform. The central object in these studies is the prepotential: a function of "time"-variables F(tα), which satisfies the WDVV equations:

[formula]

Here Cμ are matrices,

[formula]

and the "metric"

[formula]

In conventional theory of quantum cohomologies there is a distinguished variable t0 (associated with the unity φ0  =  I in the ring H*(M)), such that the metric η  =  η(0)  =  F0 in ([\ref=metric-0]) is constant:

[formula]

As a corollary, the matrices Fμ and Cμ are independent of t0. In these sircumstances the set of WDVV equations ([\ref=WDVV-eq]) together with the relations ([\ref=3-der]) - saying that the "structure constants" Cμ are essentially the third derivatives of a single function F(t) - implies the consistency condition

[formula]

for the set of differential equations [\cite=DefHodge]

[formula]

with arbitrary "spectral parameter" z.

This reveals an integrable (Whitham-like) structure behind the conventional WDVV equations. (Direct interpretation of ([\ref=DefH] is in terms of deformations of the Hodge structures on Kahler manifolds.)

The "Baker-Ahiezer vector-function" ψz(t) has various intepretations.

First, [\cite=Los] [\cite=Giv], as a function of z it is a generating function of the correlators, linear in gravitational descendants (Morita-Mumford classes) cn(φ):

[formula]

Thus ψz is an important part of the reconstruction of the full spherical prepotential [formula], #  (α)  =   dim  H*(M), [formula] - the generating function of correlators with arbitrary number of descendants. Original prepotential appears when all descendant time-variables vanish:

[formula]

When descendants are included, ψz satisfies a hierarchy of quadratic equations

[formula]

which is the "quasiclassical" limit of some full (i.e. possessing a group-theory interpretation in the spirit of [\cite=gentau]) integrable hierarchy - to which the full prepotential, the generating function of all correlators for all genera, is a solution.

Second, the function ψz usually posseses integral representations of the form

[formula]

along some cicles on some manifold [formula] - which is interpreted as a mirror of M. In concrete examples (see, for example, [\cite=Giv]) this representation is implied by the hidden group-theory structure behind integrable system ([\ref=DefH]), which allows to interpret ψz as eigenfunctions of Casimir operators. Such eigenfunctions are well known to possess natural integrable representations, see [\cite=Lapred] and references therein.

Clarification of these constructions, associating some (loop) algebra with a manifold, remains an interesting open question.

WDVV Equations in Seiberg-Witten Theory

The WDVV-like equations are now known to arise in a somewhat broader context than conventional quantum cohomologies. Namely, one can relax the condition ([\ref=metconst]) and study the WDVV equations in the situation when there is no distinguished modulus t0 and no distinguished metric η(0). Such situation arises, for example, in Seiberg-Witten theory [\cite=SW] of low-energy effective actions for N = 2 SUSY Yang-Mills models in four and five dimensions. This theory is long known to involve integrable structures [\cite=int] and the prepotential (quasiclassical τ-function) theory [\cite=prep]. The WDVV-like equations arise in Seiberg-Witten theory in the form [\cite=MMM]:

[formula]

i.e. the role of the metric η can be played by any matrix Fλ (actually, by any linear combination of such matrices). Accordingly, the mutually commuting matrices C(λ)μ  =  F- 1λFμ,

[formula]

are now implicitely dependent on the choice of λ.

However, since generically there is no constant (moduli-independent) matrix Fλ, the generalized WDVV equations ([\ref=WDVV]) no longer imply ([\ref=DefH]). This system of consistent equations is instead substituted by

[formula]

or, in a more symmetric form,

[formula]

It is easy to see that the operators with different μ at the l.h.s. commute with each other:

[formula]

The first term at the r.h.s. vanishes due to the WDVV equations, and the second one can be seen to vanish if the definition of C(λ)μ is used together with the fact that Fμ are matrices, consisting of third derivatives. Eq.([\ref=int2]) is ([\ref=int1]), multiplied by a matrix Fλ from the left.

It can still seem non-obvious that equations ([\ref=int2]) are all consistent, i.e. that the vector ψ can be chosen in a λ-independent way. This follows from the relation:

[formula]

In order to return back from the generic system ([\ref=int1]) to ([\ref=DefH]), it is enough to choose ψ  =  ezt0ψz, what is a self-consistent anzats when all the C(0)μ are t0-independent.

There is no spectral parameter in the system ([\ref=int2]), instead it is homogeneous (linear) in derivatives and possesses many solutions. They can be formally represented in the form:

[formula]

and one can choose, for example, ψ̃(t)  =  eztλ. Then different terms of expansion of ([\ref=ser]) in z are different solutions to ([\ref=int1]).

As a simplest example, one can take

[formula]

which is the perturbative prepotential for SU(3) N = 2 SYM model in 4d. Then the first few solution to ([\ref=int2]) are:

[formula]

By the way, ψα  =  tα is always a solution to ([\ref=int2]) - this follows immediately from the definition of Fμ's as the matrices of the 3-rd derivatives, which are symmetric under permutations of indices.

Conclusion and acknowledgements

The purpose of this letter is to explain that appropriate integrable structure on the moduli space exists behind the generalized WDVV equations, i.e. existence of a constant metric is not needed for such structure to emerge. I do not touch here neither interpretation, nor implications of this simple statement. They will be discussed elsewhere.
