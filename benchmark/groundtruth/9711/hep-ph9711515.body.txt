Plenary talk at the International Europhysics Conference on High Energy Physics, Jerusalem, 19-26 August 1997

Precision measurements of the Z boson

Lineshape and leptonic forward-backward asymmetries

The accurate measurement of the Z mass is essential for precise tests of the Standard Model. This measurement is dominated by the energy scans performed at LEP in 1993 and 1995, in which approximately 40 [formula] of data were recorded at energies [formula] GeV away from the Z peak. Important progress has been made in the last year in understanding the LEP beam energy for these scans, and final results became available shortly before the conference. The estimated errors on the centre-of-mass energy (in MeV) are:

The path is now clear for the LEP experiments to complete their analyses of the data. The principal changes to the results compared to those presented in 1996 [\cite=blondel] [\cite=lepew96] are (see [\cite=quast] for more details):

The new beam energy values have already been incorporated by ALEPH and DELPHI; OPAL and L3 have chosen not to update their results at this stage, but an appropriate correction to the Z mass and width values has been applied.

Some data from the 1995 run have been added by OPAL and L3, and there have been significant changes to the τ+τ- measurements from ALEPH.

L3 have included the 1995 data in their τ polarization measurements [\cite=pr481].

A preliminary measurement of [formula] from the SLD 1996 data is available.

Overall the changes in the combined results since last year are quite small. The basic combined LEP measurements are [\cite=quast]:

χ2/dof=21/27 χ2/dof=23/31

The data from the four experiments are in excellent agreement, as shown by the values of χ2/dof.

From these measurements, it is possible to infer a value for the invisible width of the Z:

[formula]

which can be converted into a measurement of the number of light neutrino species assuming they have Standard Model couplings:

[formula]

A limit on the possible additional invisible width arising from new physics can also be inferred: [formula] MeV at 95% c.l.

The results from the Z leptonic lineshape and asymmetries can be combined with measurements of the τ polarization and its asymmetry (which are sensitive to the electron and τ couplings separately) to perform the best tests of lepton universality. In fig. [\ref=fig_leptuniv] we show the vector and axial couplings for each lepton species, as inferred from the LEP data. The measurements are clearly consistent with universality of the Z leptonic couplings, with a precision of ~  0.2% for [formula] and 5-10% for [formula], and also with the Standard Model expectation, indicated by the shaded area with uncertainties arising from varying the Higgs mass between 60 and 1000 GeV and the t-quark mass in the range [formula] GeV. The measurement of [formula] from SLD is also shown. Under the assumption of lepton universality, the following values for the couplings are obtained:

Heavy flavour electroweak measurements

The main changes in the past year, reviewed in [\cite=mariotti] [\cite=etzion], are:

Measurements of [formula] from ALEPH [\cite=A_Rb], OPAL [\cite=O_Rb] and SLD have been finalised for publication in the last year, and new preliminary measurements from DELPHI [\cite=pr419], L3 [\cite=pr489] and SLD [\cite=pr118] have led to significantly improved precision.

New determinations of [formula] from OPAL [\cite=O_Rc], ALEPH [\cite=pr623] and SLD [\cite=pr120] (the latter exploiting a double vertex tag), have led to continued improvement in the precision of this measurement.

There are new measurements of the forward backward asymmetry [formula] from L3 [\cite=pr490] and OPAL [\cite=O_AFBb], but an ALEPH result has been withdrawn, so the overall precision of the measurement is unchanged.

The SLD measurements of the polarized asymmetries [\cite=pr122] have led to a much improved determination of [formula].

The combined LEP/SLD heavy flavour measurements may be summarized as follows:

In fig. [\ref=fig_rbrc] we compare the measured values of [formula] and [formula] with the Standard Model expectations. The apparent disagreement which excited much interest in previous years has evaporated.

The various measurements of polarizations and asymmetries at LEP and SLD can be interpreted, in the context of the Standard Model, as measurements of the effective electroweak mixing parameter [formula]. In fig. [\ref=fig_s2tw] we show a comparison of the various determinations of [formula]. The values are not incompatible with a common value (χ2/dof=12.6/6), though it should be noted that the two most precise determinations (from [formula] and the forward-backward b-quark asymmetry) show the largest discrepancies from the mean. In fig. [\ref=fig_s2twrl] we show the measured values of [formula] and the leptonic width [formula], which are in good agreement with the Standard Model expectation. The star indicates the prediction if only photonic radiative corrections are applied, with the arrow showing the non-negligible uncertainty induced by the running of the electromagnetic coupling. The data clearly demonstrate the need for electroweak radiative corrections, and their sensitivity to the Higgs mass [formula] is also evident.

Fermion pair production at LEP II

Fermion-pair production at energies well above the Z resonance is characterized by a tendency for radiative return to the Z through the emission of one or more photons from the initial state. The main physics interest, and the greatest sensitivity to new physics, lies in the events with only a small amount of initial state radiation. Non-radiative events are selected by imposing a cut on the effective c.m. energy of the fermion-pair, [formula], which can be reconstructed from the event kinematics. Measurements now exist of fermion pair cross-sections and forward-backward asymmetries up to 183 GeV (see [\cite=cpw] for a compilation and detailed references).

The measurements are all in excellent agreement with the Standard Model. They may be interpreted in various ways - either to constrain parameters of the Standard Model, or to place limits on new physics (for more details, see [\cite=cpw]). For example, the hadronic cross-section at LEP II can be used to constrain [formula] W [formula] interference. The data taken on the Z peak constrain this interference only weakly, so it is normally fixed to its Standard Model expectation. A more model independent interpretation of the data can be performed using the S-matrix formalism [\cite=Smat], allowing the parameter [formula] which parametrizes - W interference in the hadronic cross-section to be free. By including data above and below the Z, where interference is sizeable, the precision of the determination of [formula], and hence of [formula] in this framework, are greatly improved. The values obtained are [formula] and [formula] (c.f. [formula] in the Standard Model).

Mass of the W boson

As we shall see below, the precise measurements of the Z boson allow the mass of the W boson to be predicted with a precision of of around [formula] MeV. A major goal of the LEP II and Tevatron programs is to match this precision by direct measurement, so as to provide a new test of the Standard Model.

At LEP II,  pairs are produced either via s-channel W/  or t-channel neutrino exchange. The first runs at LEP II were at 161 GeV, just above  threshold. At this energy, the  cross-section is very sensitive to the W mass. The  cross-section, averaged over all four LEP experiments [\cite=MW161], is shown in fig. [\ref=fig_wwxs]. From the cross-section at 161 GeV, the W mass is obtained as [formula] GeV, where the error is predominantly statistical.

At higher energies, the cross-section is much less sensitive to the W mass, and the better technique is to reconstruct the W mass directly from the invariant mass of its decay products. The final states [formula] and [formula] can both be used for this purpose. Kinematic fit techniques, imposing energy and momentum conservation and equality of the two W masses in each event, are used to improve the mass resolution. The results obtained after averaging the measurements from each LEP experiment [\cite=MW172] [\cite=fasso], are:

In this direct reconstruction approach, the [formula] final state is potentially more problematical than [formula] because it can be affected by hadronic final state interaction effects. These can arise because the two Ws typically decay so close together that they are within the range of the strong interaction. It has been suggested that colour reconnection effects [\cite=yb2] could bias the reconstructed W mass in the [formula] channel by several hundred MeV. However, the models which predict the largest effect [\cite=eg] also predict other observable effects, such as a ~  10% reduction in the hadron multiplicity in the [formula] case. Data already exist [\cite=pr307] comparing the hadronic W decay multiplicity in the [formula] and [formula] final states, yielding a ratio of 1.04±  0.03. At first sight this appears inconsistent with the most extreme colour reconnection model, though caution is needed because the models used to correct the data do not include the colour reconnection effect. Another possible problem could result from Bose-Einstein correlations between pions from different Ws. Data from LEP so far [\cite=pr717], with large errors, show no evidence for such correlations, consistent with the most recent theoretical investigations [\cite=kkm].

At the Tevatron, W bosons are produced singly from [formula] fusion. The leptonic W decays [formula] ([formula]) are used to defeat QCD background, with the neutrino inferred from missing momentum. The value of [formula] may be extracted from the distribution of transverse mass of [formula], as shown in fig. [\ref=fig_cdfmt]. The current results from CDF and D0 are 80.375±  0.120 GeV and 80.44±  0.11 GeV respectively [\cite=MWfnal] [\cite=cdfw] [\cite=d0w]. The combined W mass measurement from hadron collider experiments (including UA2) is [formula] GeV.

The measurements of [formula] from hadron colliders and from LEP II are therefore in excellent agreement. The combined "World Average" is:

[formula]

At present this average is dominated by the Tevatron measurements. However, if LEP delivers say 50 [formula] of data per experiment in 1997, the LEP error can be expected to reduce to around 0.08 GeV. By the end of LEP II and after the Tevatron upgrade, both LEP and Fermilab expect to be able to reach a precision on [formula] around 0.03-0.04 GeV.

Global Standard Model Fits

Combined fits of the Standard Model have been performed to the measurements of Z decays and the W mass outlined above. Additional measurements can also be included: the top quark mass [formula] GeV [\cite=mt], the value of [formula] from [formula] scattering (which includes a new result from CCFR [\cite=ccfr]) and the value of the electromagnetic coupling, [formula] [\cite=ej], which carries an error because of the need to run it to scale [formula]. In the fits, [formula], () and optionally [formula] and [formula]  are treated as free parameters.

Three fits have been performed, with the results shown below:

A fit to LEP I and LEP II data only.

A fit to all data except the direct measurements of [formula] and [formula]. This permits a direct comparison between the direct and indirect determinations of these masses, as shown in fig. [\ref=fig_mwmt]. The two sets of measurements are seen to be consistent.

A fit to all data. As in the previous two fits, the χ2/dof value is excellent, showing that the data are globally compatible with the Standard Model. In fig. [\ref=fig_pulls] we show the input measurements and the pulls for this fit, i.e. the difference between fitted and measured values divided by the error. The distribution of pulls is satisfactory, with only one measurement ([formula] from [formula]) more than two standard deviations from the Standard Model.

The results of the fits provide an indirect estimate of the mass of the Higgs boson, [formula]. The most precise estimate comes from the fit to all data, yielding  = 115+ 116- 66 GeV. The two most discrepant measurements in the Standard Model fit tend to pull [formula] in opposite directions, [formula] favouring a low [formula], and [formula] preferring a high value. The dependence on [formula] of the difference between χ2 and its minimum value is shown in fig. [\ref=fig_mh]. The band indicates an estimate of the theoretical uncertainties resulting from uncomputed higher order terms. Taking this into account, an upper limit on [formula] may be placed:

[formula]

In deriving this limit, the lower mass limit derived from direct searches,  > 77 GeV [\cite=murray] [\cite=janot], has not been taken into account.

The value obtained for [formula] is one of the most accurate measurements, even after including a theoretical systematic error of about [formula]. This measurement is compared with other recent determinations [\cite=as] in fig. [\ref=fig_as]. The measurements display a good level of consistency, which is a pleasing improvement on the situation a couple of years ago. A reasonable World Average value is

[formula]

where the error has been estimated very simply as the r.m.s. deviation of the measurements from the mean.

Width and branching ratios of the W boson

W Width

The most precise (but indirect) estimate of the W width is based on the observed W and Z cross-sections at the Tevatron, using the relation

[formula]

Taking the cross-sections from QCD, the Z data from LEP, and [formula] from the Standard Model, the combined CDF/D0 data yield [formula] GeV, to be compared with the Standard Model expectation of [formula] GeV. A more direct measurement can be made from a detailed study of the tail of the transverse mass distribution (fig. [\ref=fig_cdfmt]). The latest result from CDF [\cite=cdfw] is [formula] GeV. First results from LEP [\cite=MW172], based on direct observation of the W lineshape, have started to appear:

[formula](stat.)[formula](syst.) (L3) [formula](stat.)[formula](syst.) (OPAL)

At present the errors are not competitive, but an interesting measurement should be possible by the end of the 1997 run.

W branching ratios and [formula]

The observation of  production at LEP permits a direct determination of the W branching ratios. The combined results from LEP are [\cite=burgard]:

The leptonic results are consistent with lepton universality, though not yet competitive with results from other processes, such as τ decays. The hadronic branching ratio can be related to elements of the CKM matrix:

[formula]

Amongst these CKM elements, [formula] is by far the least well measured ([formula]=1.01±  0.18 from D meson decays). One can therefore take the other elements from the PDG world averages, and infer a value [formula].

Direct measurements of [formula] using charm tagging are also appearing [\cite=pr535], which yield a more direct determination of [formula]. The values to date are:

[formula](stat.)[formula](syst.) (ALEPH)  = 0.87+ 0.26- 0.22(stat.)[formula](syst.) (DELPHI)

Although [formula] can be constrained much more strongly by the unitarity of the CKM matrix, these direct measurements will ultimately provide an interesting check.

Triple Gauge Couplings

The WWZ and WW couplings are predicted by the Standard Model, and can be tested by the LEP and Tevatron experiments. The effective Lagrangian used to parametrize any anomalous couplings involves [formula] parameters to describe most general Lorentz invariant WWV (V=Z,) vertices. By assuming C, P, and electromagnetic gauge invariance, this can be reduced to a more practicable set of five parameters: λγ, [formula] (=0 in Standard Model) and κγ, [formula], [formula] (=1 in Standard Model); gγ1 = 1 results from electromagnetic gauge invariance. These parameters may be related to the static moments of the :

At LEP II, anomalous values for these couplings generally increase the  cross-section. We see from fig. [\ref=fig_wwxs] that the measured cross-sections clearly require the existence of both WWZ and WW couplings. Anomalous couplings also influence the production angle of the  and affect the helicity states, and hence the decay angles, of the [formula]. The [formula] final states are particularly sensitive, because the lepton charge allows an unambiguous assignment of the W charges. Futher information can be obtained from "single W production" (i.e. [formula] final states with only a single on-shell W) and [formula] final states, which are particularly sensitive to the WW vertex.

The precise measurements of the Z already constrain possible anomalous couplings. For this reason, the LEP experiments have focussed on the following combinations of anomalous couplings, which do not affect gauge boson propagators at tree level, and are therefore not already indirectly constrained:

[formula]

with the constraint [formula]. All these couplings should be zero according to the Standard Model. Combined results from the four experiments have been obtained by adding likelihood curves from each experiment, taking both cross-section and angular information into account, as illustrated in fig. [\ref=fig_awf]. The results are [\cite=weber] [\cite=leptgc]:

Thus no discrepancy from the Standard Model is observed.

In  experiments, information may be gleaned in two ways. Observation of the rate of [formula] production, especially for high pT photons, is sensitive to the WW coupling (and thus complementary to LEP II, which is sensitive to WWZ as well). The results are:

In addition a few instances of WW or WZ pair production are observed in [formula] and [formula] final states. The must stringent limits are obtained by D0 [\cite=d0w] [\cite=pr106] in a combined fit to all channels, assuming equal WWZ and WW couplings: - 0.33 < Δκ < 0.45 and - 0.20 < λ < 0.20, as shown in fig. [\ref=fig_tgcd0]. Where comparison is possible, at present the Tevatron limits are typically better than the LEP II limits by a factor 2. This situation should start to change by the end of the 1997 LEP run.

Summary

In summary, the electroweak sector of the Standard Model continues to stand up to all tests. The precise electroweak measurements in Z decays at LEP I are coming to an end, and only modest improvements can be expected. The distinctive contribution from polarized beam measurements at SLC is set to continue. The results on W physics from LEP II and the Tevatron are starting to appear, and over the next few years a factor [formula] more data is anticipated at both machines, to pursue tests of the Standard Model.
