HAS THE UNIVERSE A HONEYCOMB STRUCTURE?

Introduction

According to the current paradigm of the large-scale structure of the Universe galaxies and clusters of galaxies are concentrated to elongated filamentary chains and the space between filaments is void of galaxies. Such distribution resembles cells [\cite=zes82]; examples are the Northern Local Void surrounded by the Local, Coma, and Hercules superclusters, and the Bootes void located between the Hercules and Bootes supercluster [\cite=l95].

Superclusters and voids form a continuous network of alternating high- and low-density regions [\cite=me]. They are formed by density waves of wavelength corresponding to the scale of the supercluster-void network. It is believed that density waves have a Gaussian distribution, thus high- and low-density regions should be randomly distributed. It was therefore a great surprise when Broadhurst et al.  [\cite=beks90] found that the distribution of high-density regions in a small area around the northern and southern Galactic pole is fairly regular: high- and low-density alternate with rather constant step of 128 h- 1  Mpc. The regularity is so far well established only in the direction of Galactic polar caps, in other directions the regularity is much less pronounced. In order to find the degree of regularity of the supercluster-void network 3-dimensional data of the distribution of high-density regions are needed. For this purpose Abell-ACO clusters of galaxies [\cite=abell] can be used, as they form the largest and deepest sample of astronomical objects covering the whole celestial sphere outside the Milky Way zone of avoidance.

Distribution of clusters of galaxies

The distribution of clusters of galaxies located in very rich superclusters with at least 8 member-clusters is shown in Figure 1  [\cite=me]. We see a rather regular network of superclusters and voids. High-density regions are separated from each other by a rather constant intervals of ≈  120 h- 1  Mpc. Such quasiregular distribution resembles honeycombs or 3D chessboard [\cite=tully].

The correlation function of quasiregularly located sample of clusters of galaxies should have periodic maxima and minima which correspond to mutual distances of high- and low-density regions. Such a phenomenon is actually observed [\cite=einasto2]. The power spectrum of clusters of galaxies has a peak on wavelength λ0 = 120 h- 1  Mpc which corresponds to the size of the step of the supercluster-void network [\cite=einasto] (see Figure 2). On short wavelengths the spectrum can be approximated by a power law with index n =  - 1.8. On long wavelengths the spectrum is compatible with the Harrison-Zeldovich spectrum with power index n = 1.

This unusual form of the power spectrum raises the question: Is such a peaked power spectrum compatible with the angular spectrum of the temperature anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)? The temperature anisotropy spectrum has a maximum around wavenumber l  ≈  200 due to oscillations of the hot plasma before recombination. This range of the spectrum has recently been measured in Saskatoon [\cite=saskatoon]. We have calculated the angular spectrum for standard CDM-type model and a model with the peaked power spectrum [\cite=atrio]. This test shows that using an appropriate set of cosmological parameters the peaked power spectrum is in agreement with CMB data. However, CMB data is not sufficient to discriminate between the standard CDM-type and the peaked power spectrum.

A density field with a smooth power spectrum as produced in CDM-type models will generate a random distribution of high- and low-density regions [\cite=einasto2], in contrast to recent cluster data. This leads us to the conclusion that the combined evidence from cluster and CMB data favour models with a built-in scale in the initial spectrum. Double inflation models provide a possible scenario where the formation of a peak could have taken place. A version of the double inflation model is suggested by Starobinsky [\cite=starobinski]. The study of the distribution of matter on large scales could provide a direct test of more complicated models of inflation.
