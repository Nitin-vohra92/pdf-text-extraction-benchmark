The Higgs boson mass bound in MSSM broken at high scale

At present one of the most urgent problems in high energy physics is the search for the Higgs boson. The lower LEP1 bound on the Higgs boson mass is [\cite=1]

[formula]

In standard Weinberg-Salam model there are several theoretical bounds on the Higgs boson mass :

(i) Tree level unitarity requirement leads to mh  ≤  1 TeV [\cite=2].

(ii) The requirement of the absence of the Landau pole singularity for the effective Higgs self-coupling constant for energies up to 1014 GeV gives mh  ≤  200 GeV for mpoletop  ≤  200 GeV [\cite=3].

(iii) The vacuum stability requirement leads to the lower bound on the Higgs boson mass which depends on the top quark mass [\cite=4].

The minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model (MSSM) [\cite=5] predicts at tree level that the lightest Higgs boson has to be lighter than the Z-boson [\cite=5]. Radiative corrections slightly increase the value of the lightest Higgs boson mass [\cite=6].

In our previous paper [\cite=7] we studied the dependence of the Higgs boson mass on the scale of supersymmetry breaking in MSSM using one loop renormalization group equations for the effective coupling constants. In this note we reanalize this problem using two loop renormalization group equations for the effective coupling constant and recent more accurate world average value of the strong coupling constant αs(Mz) = 0.118  ±  0.003 [\cite=8] and the value of the top quark mass mpoletop  =  175  ±  6 Gev [\cite=9].

Our main assumption is that the standard Weinberg-Salam model originates from its minimal supersymmetric extension which is explicitly broken due to soft supersymmetry breaking terms at scale Ms. The tree level Higgs potential in the MSSM model with general soft supersymmetry breaking terms is given by [\cite=5]

[formula]

Here g1 and g2 are the U(1) and SU(2) gauge coupling constants and the Higgs doublets H1 and H2 couple with q  =   - 1 / 3 and q  =  2 / 3 quarks respectively. We assume that one of the combinations of the H1 and H2

[formula]

is relatively light, mlight  ≈  O(Mz), whereas the other orthogonal combination

[formula]

acquires a mass mheavy  ≈  O(Ms). We also assume that the masses of the superpartners of ordinary particles are of the order of O(Ms). It is clear that for such scenario for Ms  ≥  O(1) TeV it is necessary to have fine tuning among the soft supersymmetry breaking terms.

At scales lower than the supersymmetry breaking scale Ms we have the standard Weinberg-Salam model with the single Higgs isodoublet H  =  Hlight. The crusial point is that the self-interaction effective coupling constant λ̄(Ms) at scale Ms is

[formula]

To preserve the supersymmetry the gauge couplings 1(Ms) and 2(Ms) have to be calculated within the [formula]-scheme [\cite=10]. The relation between the gauge coupling constants in the [formula]-scheme and [formula]-scheme has the form [\cite=10]

[formula]

where C2(G) is the quadratic Casimir operator for the adjoint representation (C2(SU(N))  =  N.

So the assumption that standard Weinberg-Salam model originates from its supersymmetric extension with the supersymmetry broken at scale Ms allows us to obtain non-trivial information about the low energy effective Higgs self-coupling constant and hence to obtain nontrivial information about the Higgs boson mass. To relate the high energy value of the Higgs self-interaction effective coupling constant λ̄(Ms) with the low energy value of λ̄(Mt) it is necessary to use the renormalization group requations. The renormalization group equations for the effective coupling constants in neglection of all Yukawa coupling constants except top-quark Yukawa coupling constant in one-loop approximation read

Here 3, 2 and 1 are the SU(3), SU(2) and U(1) gauge coupling, respectively, and t is the top quark Yukawa coupling constant. In our numerical analysis we studied the renormalization group equations for the effective coupling constants in two loop approximation [\cite=11] in [formula]-scheme. We used the following central values for the initial effective coupling constants at Mz-scale [\cite=8],[\cite=12],[\cite=13]:

For boundary condition (7) for the Higgs self-coupling constant λ̄(Ms) we have integrated numerically the renormalization group equations in two loop approximation. Also we took into account one loop correction to the Higgs boson mass [\cite=14] (running Higgs boson mass [formula] does not coincide with pole Higgs boson mass. We used two loop formulae of ref.15 which relate the running top quark mass with pole top quark mass. Our results for the Higgs boson mass for different values of Ms and mpoletop are presented in Table 1. Here k = 0 corresponds to the boundary condition λ̄(Ms)  =  0 and k = 1 corresponds to the boundary condition [formula]. We have found that our numerical results practically do not depend on the uncertainties in the determination of the electroweak couplings at Mz-scale and also on the use of the boundary condition (6) for electroweak coupling constants in the [formula]-scheme instead of the [formula]-scheme. The uncertainty in the determination of the strong coupling constant at Mz-scale leads to the uncertainty in the determination of the Higgs boson mass less than 2 GeV. The dependence of the Higgs boson mass on the scale of supersymmetry breaking Ms is very weak in the interval 108 GeV   ≤  Ms  ≤  1016 GeV.

From the requirement of the absence of Landau pole singularity for the Higgs self-coupling constant λ̄(Λ) for the scales up to Λ  =  (103;104;106;108;1010;1012;1014) GeV (to be precise we require that at the scale Λ the Higgs self-coupling constant is [formula]) we have found the upper bound on the Higgs boson mass mh  ≤  400;300;240;200;180;170;160) GeV, respectively.

It should be noted that in nonminimal supersymmetric electroweak models, say in the model with additional gauge singlet σ we have due to the term kσH1iτ2H2 in the superpotential an additional term k2|H1iτ2H2|2 in the potential and as a consequence our boundary condition for the Higgs self-coupling constant has to be modified, namely

[formula]

The boundary condition (18) depends on unknown coupling constant k̄2(Ms). However, it is very important to stress that for all nonminimal supersymmetric models broken to standard Weinberg-Salam model at scale Ms the effective Higgs self-coupling constant λ̄(Ms) is non-negative that is a direct consequence of the non-negativity of the effective potential in supersymmetric models. Therefore, the vacuum stability requirement results naturally if supersymmetry is broken at some high scale Ms and at lower scales standard Weinberg-Salam model is an effective theory.

As it follows from our results for 170 GeV ≤  mpoletop  ≤   180 GeV and for Ms  ≤   1 TeV the Higgs boson mass is less than 120 GeV, while for the same values of the top quark mass and for the supersymmetry breaking scale Ms  ≥  108 GeV the Higgs boson mass is larger than 120 GeV. Therefore, for such values of the top quark mass the measurement of the Higgs boson mass will discriminate standard scenario with low energy broken suppersymmetry and scenario with standard Weinberg-Salam model valid up to very high scale [\cite=16]. Moreover, for such values of the top quark mass the discovery at LEP2 the Higgs boson with the mass lighter than 85 GeV would mean that the scale of new physics is less than 5 TeV.
