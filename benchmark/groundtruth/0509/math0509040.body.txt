The Kac Jordan superalgebra: automorphisms and maximal subalgebras

Introduction.

Finite dimensional simple Jordan superalgebras over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero were classified by V. Kac in 1977 [\cite=Kac] (see also Kantor [\cite=Kan], where a missing case is added). Among these superalgebras we find the ten dimensional Kac Jordan superalgebra, K10, which is exceptional (see [\cite=McC2] and [\cite=Sht]) and plays a significant role (see [\cite=MedZel]).

Here we are interested in describing the group of automorphisms of K10 and, as a consequence, in classifying the maximal subalgebras of the Kac superalgebra over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero.

In two previous works (see [\cite=mio], [\cite=otro]), the authors have given a description of maximal subalgebras of finite dimensional central simple superalgebras which are either associative or associative with superinvolution and also a description of maximal subalgebras of finite dimensional special simple Jordan superalgebras over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. These papers are thus in the spirit of previous work by E. Dynkin ([\cite=Dy1], [\cite=Dy2]), M. Racine ([\cite=Ra1], [\cite=Ra2]) or A. Elduque ([\cite=E]) about maximal subalgebras of different classes of algebras.

Let F be a field of characteristic not two. This assumption will be kept throughout the paper. Recall that a superalgebra is a [formula]-graded algebra [formula] ([formula]). If a∈Aα we say that a is a homogeneous element and we use the notation ā  =  α. Elements belonging to [formula] are called even elements and the ones in [formula] odd elements. A superalgebra A is said to be non trivial if [formula], and it is called simple if it contains no proper nontrivial graded ideals and A2  ≠  0.

A Jordan algebra is an algebra satisfying the following identities: The last identity can be written as (x2,y,x) = 0, where (x,y,z) denotes the associator (xy)z - x(yz). Following the standard procedure, a superalgebra is a Jordan superalgebra if its Grassmann envelope is a Jordan algebra. In particular, a Jordan superalgebra satisfies the identities for homogeneous elements x,y,z,t. (If the characteristic is ≠  2,3, these two identities characterize Jordan superalgebras.)

The even part of a Jordan superalgebra is a Jordan algebra, while the odd part is a Jordan bimodule for the even part.

Associative superalgebras are just [formula]-graded associative algebras, but note that Jordan superalgebras are not [formula]-graded Jordan algebras.

The following examples of Jordan algebras will be useful in the sequel:

Let A be an associative algebra over a ground field of characteristic [formula]. The new operation [formula] defines a structure of a Jordan algebra on A. It is denoted by A+.

Let V be a vector space over F with a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form ( , ):V  ×  V  →  F. The direct sum F1 + V with the product (λ1  +  v)(μ1 + w) = (λμ  +  (v,w))1 + (λw  +  μv) is a Jordan algebra, and it is called the Jordan algebra of a nondegenerate bilinear form.

Simple finite dimensional Jordan algebras over an algebraically closed field were classified by P. Jordan, J. von Neumann, E. Wigner ([\cite=JNW]) and by A. Albert ([\cite=A]). The examples given above are two of the four types of algebras given in that classification.

Also the following examples of Jordan superalgebras will be needed later on:

J = K3, the Kaplansky superalgebra:

The family of superalgebras J = Dt, with [formula]:

J = K10, the Kac superalgebra, which will be described in more detail in the following section.

The superalgebra of a superform: Let [formula] be a graded vector space over F, and let ( , ) be a nondegenerate supersymmetric bilinear superform on V, that is, a nondegenerate bilinear map which is symmetric on [formula], skewsymmetric on [formula], and [formula] are orthogonal relative to ( , ). Now consider [formula], [formula] with e  ·  x = x, v  ·  w  =  (v,w)e for every x∈J, v,w∈V. This superalgebra, J, is called the superalgebra of a superform.

A+, with A an associative superalgebra over a field of characteristic not 2, where the product operation in A has been changed to [formula]

As we have mentioned at the beginning of this Introduction, V. Kac and I. Kantor gave the classification of nontrivial simple Jordan superalgebras. The four examples given above are also examples of simple Jordan superalgebras, assuming in 3) that the characteristic is not 3, and in 4) that A is a simple associative superalgebra (see [\cite=Wall]).

In this paper, our purpose is to describe the group of automorphisms of K10 and also to classify its maximal subalgebras.

Kac superalgebra

The Kac superalgebra, [formula] is a Jordan superalgebra with 6-dimensional even part and 4-dimensional odd part:

[formula]

and product given in Table [\ref=ta:K10].

This basis of K10 is obtained by using the one in [\cite=RaZ] with a = v1 + v2, b = v1 - v2, c1 = v3, c2 = v4, p1 = x1 - y2, p2 = x2 + y1, q1 = x1 + y2, q2 = x2 - y1.

From [\cite=Ki] we know that [formula] where J(V,Q) is the Jordan algebra of a nondegenerate bilinear form Q, e is the identity element in J(V,Q), and V is the vector space with basis {a,b,c1,c2}. We will use this presentation in Section 4.

In [\cite=N-B-E] G. Benkart and A. Elduque gave a realization of K10 which enables to check directly that it is indeed a Jordan superalgebra. We introduce this construction that will be very useful for us in Section 3.

First we pick up the Kaplansky superalgebra, K3, over the field F and we define the following supersymmetric bilinear form (that is, the even and odd part are orthogonal and the form is symmetric in the even part and alternating in the odd part):

[formula]

Consider now the vector space over F: [formula] and define on it the product:

[formula]

with a,b,c,d∈K3 homogeneous elements, and where 1 is a formal identity element. Then,

If we denote by W the vector space [formula] we notice that [formula] is endowed with the bilinear nondegenerate symmetric form given by [formula]. We note also that the corresponding decomposition of [formula] into the direct sum of two simple ideals according to the one given above is [formula], where [formula] and [formula].

Automorphisms of K10

Here by automorphism we mean automorphism of graded algebras.

It is easy to compute the group of automorphisms of the examples 1), 2) and 4) of Jordan superalgebras given in Section 1. So, with the notation of Section 2, Aut(K3) = Sp(W), the symplectic group (or also Aut(K3) = SL(W), the special linear group). And Aut(Dt) = Sp(U) where U is the vector space generated by {u,v}. If J is the superalgebra of a superform then [formula] where O(n,F) denotes the orthogonal group of [formula], with [formula], related to [formula], and Sp(m,F) denotes the symplectic group of [formula], with [formula], related to [formula].

In what follows in this section it will assumed that F is a field of characteristic [formula] such that F2 = F.

Let C2  =  {1,ε} be the cyclic group of order 2 (ε2 = 1) and consider the wreath product [formula] (that is, G is the semidirect product [formula] and (f,g)ε  =  ε(g,f) for any f,g∈Sp(W)).

The following maps are clearly group homomorphisms:

[formula]

where for any f∈Sp(W), [formula] denotes the automorphism of K3 such that (e) = e, (w) = f(w) [formula]

Note that [formula]

Ψ̃ is onto with KerΨ̃  =  {  ±  (id,id)}.

Let {u,v} be a symplectic basis of W (so [formula] then if [formula] is an isotropic vector in V (that is, b(α,α) = 0), then [formula], so s,t are linearly dependent. This shows that

[formula]

Now let us show that Ψ̃ is onto. For any φ∈O(V,b), [formula] is isotropic (because so is [formula]), so there are s,t∈W with [formula]

Take f,g∈Sp(W) with f(s)  =  u, g(t)  =  u. Hence φ∈imΨ̃ if and only if

[formula]

and, therefore, it can be assumed that [formula]

Now [formula] for some s,t∈W with

[formula]

and there exists 0  ≠  α∈F such that [formula] [formula] or [formula] [formula] Thus there are f,g∈Sp(W) such that f(u)  =  u, f(v)  =  α- 1s, g(u)  =  u, g(v)  =  αt, and changing φ to [formula] we may assume that [formula] [formula]

Then [formula] is isotropic and orthogonal to both [formula] and [formula] so it is a scalar multiple of either [formula] or [formula] By using Ψ̃(ε)  =   we may assume that [formula] for some 0  ≠  γ∈F and then, necessarily [formula] Let μ∈F  =  F2 with μ2  =  γ, then [formula] where f(u)  =  μu, f(v)  =  μ- 1v, g(u)  =  μ- 1u, g(v)  =  μv, so that φ∈imΨ̃.

The assertion about the kernel is clear.

Ψ is onto with KerΨ  =  {id,τ}, where τ is the grading automorphism [formula] for any homogeneous z∈K10).

Since [formula] and Ψ̃ is onto, so is Ψ. Finally, if φ∈AutK10 belongs to the kernel of Ψ, then [formula] so [formula] for any [formula] and [formula]

For any s∈W, [formula] is, up to scalars, the unique odd element annihilated by [formula] ([formula]), hence [formula] for some 0  ≠  β∈F.

Take t∈W with [formula] then [formula] [formula] so [formula] for any z∈W. It follows that [formula] and, since φ is an automorphism, β2  =  1 so φ is either the identity or the grading automorphism τ.

Since Φ( - id, - id) = τ, Φ(KerΨ̃)  =  KerΨ. Now the assertion follows from the fact that [formula] together with Lemmata 1 and 2.

Maximal subalgebras of K10

In what follows the word subalgebra will be used in the graded sense, so any subalgebra is graded. Also in this paragraph we consider that K10 is a superalgebra over F, an algebraically closed field of characteristic ≠  2,3.

Note that if B is a maximal subalgebra of K10, 1 = e + f∈B, as F1 + B is a subalgebra of K10 and B is an ideal in F1 + B. If [formula], then [formula], which is a subalgebra of [formula] (recall that [formula] is the direct sum of the ideals I and J = Ff, here πI and πJ denote the corresponding projections), and so the subalgebra generated by B and f equals [formula]. Since B is maximal [formula] so, in particular, [formula], but [formula] generates K10, so B = K10, a contradiction. Therefore f∈B, and hence e = 1 - f∈B too.

We use now the description of K10 given at the beginning of Section 2 and due to D. King. Then [formula] with V0 a vector subspace of V and so, in order to study the maximal subalgebras of K10, we analyze the possible dimensions of V0.

(1) If V0 = V then [formula] is a maximal subalgebra of K10.

(2) If dim V0  =  1, we have two possible situations: either the rank of Q is 1 or is 0.

If [formula] using Witt's Theorem and Theorem 3.3 we can suppose that V0 = Fa. Now [formula] with PB  =  {p∈B:pa = p}, QB  =  {q∈B:qa  =   - q}. If dim PB = 2 we can check that B = 〈e,f,a,p1,p2〉 is a maximal subalgebra of K10. Likewise if dim QB = 2, B = 〈e,f,a,q1,q2〉 is a maximal subalgebra of K10 but there is an automorphism of K10 applying 〈e,f,a,p1,p2〉 into 〈e,f,a,q1,q2〉 (the automorphism given by the isometry which applies a to - a and fix b, c1, c2). If dim PB  =   dim QB = 1, then we can check that dim V0  >  1, a contradiction. If PB = 0 then B  ⊆  〈e,f,a,q1,q2〉, which is a maximal subalgebra, and we are in the case above.

If [formula] using Witt's Theorem and Theorem 3.3 we can suppose that V0 = Fc1. But [formula] and [formula] so [formula] It follows that B = 〈e,f,c1,p1,q1〉 is not maximal since [formula]

(3) If dim V0 = 2, then [formula] or 2.

If [formula] we can suppose that V0  =  Fa + Fb, again by Witt's Theorem and Theorem 3.3. As in (2), we have that [formula] If dim PB = 2, then since bPB = QB, it follows that dim QB = 2, and then B = K10, a contradiction. If dim PB = 1 then dim QB = 1, but since [formula] it holds that either [formula] or [formula] This is a contradiction with [formula] If dim PB = 0 then dim QB = 0 and B is not a maximal subalgebra because [formula]

If [formula] then V0 = Fa + Fc1 and again [formula] If dim PB = 2 then dim QB  ≥  1 (because c1p1 = 0 and c1p2 = q1) and so B = K10, a contradiction. If dim PB = 1 then dim QB = 1 or 0. If dim QB = 1, from [formula] we have that QB = Fq1 and for 0  ≠  p∈PB it follows that pq1∈V0  =  Fa + Fc1, and therefore p∈Fp1. But in this case B is not maximal since [formula] And if dim QB = 0, then PB = Fp1 and again B is not maximal. Now if dim PB = 0, then dim QB = 1, with QB  =  〈q1〉. But again B is not maximal because [formula]

Finally, if [formula] we can suppose that V0  =  F  ·  (a + b) + Fc1, by Witt's Theorem and Theorem 3.3. If [formula] [formula] and [formula] therefore if γ  ≠  β then [formula] So either [formula] or [formula] Moreover with γ  ≠  β, [formula] Therefore γ  =  β and B = 〈e,f,a + b,c1,p1,q1,p2 + q2〉, which is a maximal subalgebra.

(4) If dim V0 = 3, then [formula] or 3.

If [formula] then we can suppose by Witt's Theorem and Theorem 3.3 that V0  =  Fa + Fb + F  ·  (c1 + c2). Again [formula] If dim PB = 2 then dim QB = 2 (because bPB  ⊆  QB) and [formula] a contradiction. So dim PB = 1  =   dim QB, but then, since [formula] and [formula], it follows that either [formula] or [formula] and this contradicts that [formula]

If [formula], then V0 = Fa + Fb + Fc1 and [formula] as always. If dim PB = 2 then dim QB = 2, a contradiction. So dim PB = 1 and dim QB = 1. Since PBQB  ⊆  V0 we have that [formula] and B = 〈e,f,a,b,c1,p1,q1〉, which is a maximal subalgebra of K10.

Next we describe the structure of each one of the types of maximal subalgebras that we have obtained for K10:

[formula] is semisimple, and we have seen that [formula]

< e,f,a,p1,p2  >   is semisimple and isomorphic to [formula] where

[formula]

B =  < e,f,a + b,c1,p1,q1,p2 + q2  >   has the following radical

[formula]

and the quotient of the subalgebra B by its radical is isomorphic to D- 3:

[formula]

B =  < e,f,a,b,c1,p1,q1  >   has as radical R = 〈c1,p1,q1〉 with [formula] with T the Jordan algebra of a bilineal form.

[formula]

And finally we will give the description of the maximal subalgebras of K10 in terms of the realization shown in Section 2, given by Benkart and Elduque. First consider the map

[formula]

with a,b homogeneous elements of K3. We remark that φ is an automorphism because

It is easy to compute the fixed elements by φ in terms of the original basis of K10 given in the introduction. This subalgebra is 〈e,f,c1 + c2,p1 - q2,p2 - q1〉 and now using Proposition 3.1 we know that there exists an automorphism of K10 that applies 〈e,f,a,p1,p2〉 into 〈e,f,c1 + c2,p1 - q2,p2 - q1〉 (notice that F(c1 + c2) and Fa are isometric relative to the bilinear form Q of V, and moreover [formula]). So the maximal subalgebras of type (ii) in Theorem 4.1 are conjugated to the subalgebra of fixed elements by φ.

Also the maximal subalgebras of type (iii) correspond, through the isomorphism in Theorem [\ref=th:BeEl], to [formula] that is, to subalgebras [formula] with M maximal subalgebra of K3; while the maximal subalgebras of type (iv) correspond, through the isomorphism in Theorem [\ref=th:BeEl], to [formula]
