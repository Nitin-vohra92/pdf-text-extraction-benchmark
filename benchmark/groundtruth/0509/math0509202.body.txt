Introduction

Let k be a fixed field of arbitrary characteristic and A a finite-dimensional k-algebra. Let [formula] be the enveloping algebra of A. The n-th Hochschild cohomology group of A is Hn(A): = nAe(A,A) and the Hochschild cohomology algebra of A is [formula] where the multiplication is induced by the Yoneda product for extensions [\cite=ML].

Let Q = (Q0,Q1) be a finite connected quiver where Q0 (resp. Q1) is the set of vertices (resp. arrows) in Q. Given a path p in Q, we denote by o(p) and t(p) the origin and the terminus of p respectively, and by l(p) the length of p. For 0  ≤  j  ≤  l(p), denote by jp the subpath of p with length j and origin o(p). A path [formula] with n  ≥  1 is called an oriented cycle of length n if t(ai) = o(ai + 1) for i = 1,...,n - 1 and t(an) = o(a1). An oriented cycle is called a basic cycle if it has no self intersection.

A truncated quiver algebra is an algebra kQ / knQ where n  ≥  2 and knQ denotes the ideal of kQ generated by all paths of length ≥  n (cf. [\cite=C4]). It is further called a truncated basic cycle algebra if Q is a basic cycle. We refer to [\cite=ARS] for the theory of quivers and their representations.

Though Hochschild cohomology is theoretically computable for a concrete algebra via derived functors, actual calculation for a class of algebras is still very convenient, important and difficult. So far the Hochschild cohomology was calculated for hereditary algebras [\cite=C2] [\cite=Hap], incidence algebras [\cite=C1] [\cite=GS], algebras with narrow quivers [\cite=C2] [\cite=Hap], and so on. For the Hochschild cohomology of truncated quiver algebras partial results are known: Cibils calculated the Hochschild cohomology of radical square zero algebras [\cite=C3]. In case the field k is of characteristic zero, Zhang and Locateli calculated the Hochschild cohomology of truncated basic cycle algebras and truncated quiver algebras respectively [\cite=Z0] [\cite=Z] [\cite=L]. For truncated basic cycle algebras over a field k of arbitrary characteristic, Bardzell, Locateli and Marcos calculated their Hochschild cohomology [\cite=BLM]. In this paper, we complete the calculation of the Hochschild cohomology of truncated quiver algebras over a field of arbitrary characteristic. We shall employ Locateli's strategy and do more and deeper analysis.

In 1989, Happel asked the following question: Whether for a finite dimensional algebra A over an algebraically closed field k, A  <    ∞   if and only if the Hochschild cohomology algebra of A is finite-dimensional [\cite=Hap]? Though Happel's question has negative answer [\cite=BGMS], it does have some positive answers: Avramov and Iyengar's result implies that Happel's question has positive answer for commutative algebras [\cite=AI]. Cibils' result implies that Happel's question has positive answer for radical square zero algebras [\cite=C3]. Moreover, Locateli proved that, in case the underlying field k is of characteristic 0, the Hochschild cohomology algebra of a truncated quiver algebra is finite-dimensional if and only if its quiver has no oriented cycle. In this paper, we show by constructing explicitly some Hochschild cocycles that for a truncated quiver algebra over a field of arbitrary characteristic, its Hochschild cohomology algebra is finite-dimensional if and only if its global dimension is finite if and only if its quiver has no oriented cycles.

Hochschild cohomology groups

Let A = kQ / knQ, n  ≥  2, be a truncated quiver algebra. If S and T are sets of paths in Q we denote by (S /    / T) the set {(p,q)∈S  ×  T|o(p) = o(q) and t(p) = t(q)}. If S (resp. T) is the set of paths of length i (resp. j) then we denote (S /    / T) by (i /    / j). Given a set S, kS denotes the k-vector space with basis S.

If Q is a basic cycle, Bardzell, Locateli and Marcos calculated the Hochschild cohomology of A:

Theorem 1. ([\cite=BLM]) Let A = kQ / knQ with Q a basic cycle of length e and n = me + r, 0  ≤  r  ≤  e - 1. Then we have

[formula]

[formula]

and for i  ≥  1,

[formula]

where [formula].

Thanks to Theorem 1, it remains to consider the case that Q is not a basic cycle. It follows from [\cite=L] that for all i  ≥  0, the i-th Hochschild cohomology group of A is just the i-th cohomology group of the cochain complex

for 0  ≤  j  ≤  n - 2 and

[formula]

Therefore we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

Now we recall some notations introduced by Cibils in [\cite=C4]: For 1  ≤  j  ≤  n - 2 and (p,q)∈(j /    / ni). We say that (p,q) starts together (resp. ends together) if the first (resp. last) arrow of p and q coincide. And we say that (p,q) starts at a source (resp. ends at a sink) if o(p) = o(q) is a source (resp. if t(p) = t(q) is a sink).

Suppose that (p,q) starts together, so (p,q) = (ap',aq') for some a∈Q1, and moreover suppose that (p,q) does not end at a sink. A + movement of (p,q) is a couple (p'b,q'b) where b∈t(p)Q1. If (p,q) does not start together, or if (p,q) end at a sink, then no +  movement of (p,q) is defined, and we call (p,q) a + extreme.

In analogous way, if (p,q) ends together and (p,q) does not start at a source, then we define a - movement of (p,q). If (p,q) does not end together, or starts at a source, we say (p,q) is a - extreme.

Consider the equivalence relation on (j /    / ni) by declaring (p,q) equivalent to (p',q') if there exists a finite sequence of +   or -   movements transforming (p,q) into (p',q'). We call an equivalence class a j-extreme if all its +  extreme elements end at a sink and all its -  extreme elements start at a source.

For notational convenience we denote {0-extremes[formula] and {(n - 1)-extremes} = (n - 1 /     /  ni). One can check Locateli's proofs step by step and obtain that the following proposition and two lemmas hold for the underlying field k of arbitrary characteristic.

Proposition 1. ([\cite=L]) If Q is not a basic cycle, then

[formula]

and

[formula]

Let [formula]. The support of x is the set (x) = {(p,q)|x(p,q)  ≠  0}.

Lemma 1. ([\cite=L]) (Case i = 1.) Let (o(p),p)∈(0 /    / 1) and (sq,spq)∈(d2i0(o(p),p)) with l(sq) = n - 1. Then (sq,spq) is not in the support of d2i0(o(p'),p') for any other p'  ≠  p.

Let p and q be two paths in Q. We denote by [formula] the set of the vertices that belong to both p and q. Given a cycle [formula] where i  ≥  2 and aj∈Q1 for 1  ≤  j  ≤  n(i - 1) + 1, the cycle [formula] is called the rotate of p with origin o(aj + 1).

Lemma 2. ([\cite=L]) (Case i  ≥  2.) Let (o(p),p)∈(0 /    / n(i - 1) + 1) with i  ≥  2 and (sq,spq)∈(d2i0(o(p),p)) with l(sq) = n - 1. Let (o(p'),p')∈(0 /    / n(i - 1) + 1) and (o(p),p)  ≠  (o(p'),p'). Then (sq,spq)∈(d2i0(o(p'),p')) if and only if [formula] and p' is a rotate of p with origin in some vertex in [formula].

Proposition 2. If Q is not a basic cycle then the map d2i0:  k(0 /    / n(i - 1) + 1)  →  k(n - 1 /    / ni) is injective for all i  ≥  1.

Proof. Case i = 1: Let [formula] where x(o(p),p)∈k. For any (o(p),p)∈(0 /    / 1) and (sq,spq)∈(d20(o(p),p)), by Lemma 1, we have that (sq,spq) is not in the support of d20(o(p'),p') for any p'  ≠  p. Since d20(x) = 0, we must have x(o(p),p) = 0. So x = 0 and d20 is injective.

Case i  ≥  2: Define an equivalence relation on (0 /    / n(i - 1) + 1) by saying that p is equivalent to q if p is a rotate of q. Denote by C the set of equivalence classes. We can define a complete order in the set (0 /    / n(i - 1) + 1) as follows: First give a complete order < ' to the set of classes C. Next, for each c∈C, choose [formula] and order the elements of c by the complete order < '' given by [formula]. Then consider in (0 /    / n(i - 1) + 1) the lexicographic order: [formula] where [formula] and [formula] denote the equivalence classes of p and q respectively.

We can also give a complete order to the set (n - 1 /     /  ni) as follows: First, for any fixed equivalence class [formula], we associate to it two subsets of (n - 1 /    / ni):

[formula]

and

[formula]

Next, consider the complete order on [formula] induced by the order in [formula]. Fix a complete order in [formula] and assume that every element in [formula] is smaller than that in [formula]. The order in C induces a complete order in (n - 1 /    / ni) by assuming every element in [formula] is smaller than that in [formula] if [formula] in C. Finally, given any complete order on [formula] and require every element in [formula] is smaller than that in [formula]. Thus we defined a complete order on (n - 1 /     /  ni).

Under the ordered basis of k(0 /    / n(i - 1) + 1) and k(n - 1 /    / ni) respectively, the matrix of d2i0 can be written in the form

[formula]

where each submatrix [formula] corresponds to d2i0|kcj and [formula].

Given (o(p),p)∈(0 /    / n(i - 1) + 1), Lemma 2 assures us that (n - 1p,p  ·    n - 1p)∈(d2i0(o(p'),p')) if and only if p' is a rotate of p and start at some vertex in [formula]. Let e be the length of the smallest cycle w such that p = wh for some h  ≥  1.

(i). n = 2 and   k  ≠  2: It follows from e|(n(i - 1) + 1) that e  ≠  2. If e = 1, then p = a2i - 1 for some loop a and [formula]. Since Q is not a basic cycle, [formula] and [formula] is in the form

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

If e  >  2, the rank of the matrix

[formula]

is

[formula]

Since   k  ≠  2, we have [formula].

Each block [formula] is of full rank, so the map d2i0 is injective.

(ii). n > 2 and [formula]: We write n = me + r, with 0  ≤  r < e. It is not difficult to see that (n - 1q,q  ·    n - 1q) in [formula] appears in d2i0(o(p),p) with coefficient m + 1 if q = pj with 1  ≤  j  ≤  r, or m if q = pj with j > r. Thus each matrix [formula] is of the form

[formula]

which is a cyclic matrix, where in each column we have r entries (m + 1) and (e - r) entries m.

Note that if (o(p),p)∈(0 /    / n(i - 1) + 1) then one must have [formula] (mod l(p)). So gcd(n,l(p)) = 1 and thus gcd(e,r) = 1. By [\cite=BLM], we have

[formula]

Since char [formula], we have [formula]

Each block [formula] is of full rank, so the map d2i0 is injective.

(iii). n  >  2 and char k|n, or n = 2 and char k = 2: Since Q is connected but not a basic cycle, without loss of generality, we may assume that Q contains an arrow b which does not appear in w and t(b) = o(p). Of course it is possible that o(b) belongs to the vertices of w. Moreover, we assume [formula] and p = wh for some h  ≥  1 and n = me + r, with 0  ≤  r  <  e. Clearly, [formula] and n - 2p = wm  ·    r - 2p.

(1). If m = 0 then n - 2 = r - 2, thus n - 2  <  e - 2. Hence

[formula]

So (b  ·    n - 2p,bp  ·    n - 2p) appears only in d2i0(o(p'),p') with coefficient 1 for p' = pj with 1  ≤  j  ≤  n - 1, and with coefficient 0 otherwise. Thus the row corresponding to (b  ·    n - 2p,bp  ·    n - 2p) in the matrix [formula] is of the form

[formula]

whose row-sum is n - 1  ≠  0. Therefore

[formula]

(2). If m  ≥  1 and r  ≥  2 then (b  ·    n - 2p,bp  ·    n - 2p) appears in d2i0(o(p'),p') for p' = pj with coefficient m + 1 if 1  ≤  j < r, or m if r  ≤  j  ≤  e. So the row of the matrix [formula] corresponding to (b  ·    n - 2p,bp  ·    n - 2p) is of the form

[formula]

whose row-sum is n - 1  ≠  0. Thus

[formula]

(3). If m  ≥  1 and r = 1 then [formula]. So the coefficient of (b  ·    n - 2p,bp  ·    n - 2p) in d2i0(o(p'),p') for p' = pj is m if 1  ≤  j  ≤  e. Thus the row corresponding to (b  ·    n - 2p,bp  ·    n - 2p) in [formula] is of the form

[formula]

whose row-sum is also (n - 1) and hence nonzero. So

[formula]

(4). If m  ≥  1 and r = 0 then [formula]. The row corresponding to (b  ·    n - 2p,bp  ·    n - 2p) in [formula] is of the form

[formula]

whose row-sum is n - 1  ≠  0. Therefore

[formula]

Anyway, each block [formula] is of full rank, so the map d2i0 is injective. [formula]

By Proposition 2, we immediately have:

Proposition 3. If Q is not a basic cycle then, for i  ≥  1, we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

Now we can complete the calculation of the Hochschild cohomology of truncated quiver algebras over a field of arbitrary characteristic as follows:

Theorem 2. Let A = kQ / knQ be a truncated algebra. If Q is not a basic cycle quiver then we have

[formula]

[formula]

and for i  ≥  1

[formula]

[formula]

where Z(A) denotes the center of the algebra A.

Proof. It is well-known that H0(A) = Z(A). Since H0(A)  =    d1, we have

[formula]

By Proposition 3, we have

[formula]

If i  ≥  1 then by Proposition 1 and Proposition 3 we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

Hochschild cohomolgy algebras.

The main result of this section is the following:

Theorem 3. Let A = kQ / knQ be a truncated quiver algebra. Then the following conditions are equivalent:

(1) The algebra H*(A) is finite-dimensional;

(2) A <   ∞  ;

(3) Q has no oriented cycles.

Proof. (3) ⇒   (2) ⇒   (1): Clearly.

(1) ⇒   (3): If Q has an oriented cycle then we take the shortest oriented cycle [formula] in Q. Thus the vertices of w must be different from each other.

Now we show that [formula], thus d2re + 10 is not surjective, hence H2re + 1(A)  ≠  0, for all r  ≥  0:

Assume on the contrary [formula]. Then there is [formula] with [formula] such that [formula]

[formula] where xe + 1: = x1.

Let W be the k-subspace of k(1 /    / nre + 1) generated by e elements [formula] Then [formula] where [formula] is the complement of W in k(1 /    / nre + 1). According to this decomposition we have [formula] Comparing the coefficients on two sides we obtain

[formula]

It is a contradiction.
