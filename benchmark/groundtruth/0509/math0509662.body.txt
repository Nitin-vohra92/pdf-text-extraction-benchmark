Killing Vector Fields with Twistor Derivative

Introduction

The concept of twistor forms on Riemannian manifolds was introduced and intensively studied by the Japanese geometers in the 50's. Some decades later, theoretical physicists became interested in these objects, which can be used to define quadratic first integrals of the geodesic equation, (cf. Penrose and Walker [\cite=penrose]) or to obtain symmetries of field equations (cf. [\cite=be1], [\cite=be2]). More recently, a new impetus in this direction of research was given by the work of Uwe Semmelmann [\cite=uwe] (see also [\cite=bms], [\cite=au], [\cite=au1]).

Roughly speaking, a twistor form on a Riemannian manifold M is a differential p-form u such that one of the three components of its covariant derivative [formula] with respect to the Levi-Civita connection vanishes (the two other components can be identified respectively with the differential du and codifferential δu). If moreover the codifferential δu vanishes, u is called a Killing form. For p = 1, twistor forms correspond to conformal vector fields and Killing forms correspond to Killing vector fields via the isomorphism between T*M and TM induced by the metric.

Two basic examples of manifolds carrying twistor forms are the round spheres and Sasakian manifolds, cf. [\cite=uwe]. A common feature of these examples is the existence of Killing 1-forms whose exterior derivatives are twistor 2-forms.

Conversely, if ξ is a Killing 1-form of constant length with twistor derivative, then it defines a Sasakian structure (see Proposition [\ref=ks] below). It is therefore natural to drop the assumption on the length, and to address the question of classifying all Riemannian manifolds with this property.

After some preliminaries on twistor forms in Section 2, we study the behaviour of closed twistor 2-forms with respect to the curvature tensor in Section 3. This is used to obtain the following dichotomy in Section 4: if ξ is a Killing 1-form with twistor exterior derivative, then either ξ satisfies a Sasaki-type equation, or its kernel is an integrable distribution on M. The two possibilities are then studied in the last four sections, where in particular new examples of Riemannian manifolds carrying twistor 2-forms are exhibited. A complete classification is obtained in the compact case, cf. Theorem [\ref=clas].

Preliminaries

Let (Mn,g) be a Riemannian manifold. Throughout this paper vectors and 1-forms as well as endomorphisms of TM and two times covariant tensors are identified via the metric. In the sequel, {ei} will denote a local orthonormal basis of the tangent bundle, parallel at some point. We use Einstein's summation convention whenever subscripts appear twice.

We refer the reader to [\cite=uwe] for an extensive introduction to twistor forms. We only recall here their definition and a few basic properties.

By taking one more covariant derivative in ([\ref=twistor]) and summing over an orthonormal basis X = ei we see that every twistor p-form satisfies

[formula]

Taking p = 1 and δu = 0 in this formula shows that

[formula]

for every Killing 1-form u. For later use we also recall here the usual Bochner formula holding for every 1-form u:

[formula]

Notice that we have extended the usual definition (which assumes k = 1 and ξ of unit length) in order to obtain a class of manifolds invariant through constant rescaling.

If we denote by u the 2-form corresponding to the skew-symmetric endomorphism [formula], then ([\ref=dsa]) is equivalent to

[formula]

In particular, if ξ defines a Sasakian structure, then dξ is a closed twistor 2-form, a fact which was noticed by U. Semmelmann (cf. [\cite=uwe]). As a partial converse, we have the following characterization of Sasakian manifolds:

We may assume that ξ has unit length. Let us denote by u the covariant derivative of ξ

[formula]

It is a direct consequence of the Kostant formula that u is parallel in the direction of ξ (see Section 4 for details). Since u is a closed twistor form, we have

[formula]

whereas for X = ξ we get that δu is collinear to ξ. Since ξ never vanishes, there exists some function f on M such that

[formula]

On the other hand, ξ has unit length so u(ξ) = 0. Differentiating this last relation with respect to some arbitrary vector X and using ([\ref=xi1]) and ([\ref=xi2]) yields

[formula]

and in particular the square norm of u (as tensor) is

[formula]

On the other hand, ([\ref=xi1]) yields for every X∈TM

[formula]

Thus f is a constant, non-positive by ([\ref=rt]). If f = 0, ξ is parallel, otherwise ξ defines a Sasakian structure by ([\ref=xi2]).

Closed twistor 2-forms

In this section (Mn,g) is a (not necessarily compact) Riemannian manifold of dimension n > 3. We start with the following technical result

The identification between 2-forms and skew-symmetric endomorphisms is given by the formula

[formula]

Depending on whether u is viewed as a 2-form or as an endomorphism, the induced action of the curvature on it reads

[formula]

Let X and Y be vector fields on M parallel at some point. Differentiating the twistor equation satisfied by u

[formula]

in the direction of X yields

[formula]

whence

[formula]

Using the first Bianchi identity we get

[formula]

This, together with ([\ref=ind]) and ([\ref=iu]) yields

[formula]

After skew-symmetrizing in X and Y we get

[formula]

Let now ω be some skew-symmetric endomorphism of TM. We take X = ei, Y = ω(ei) in the previous equation and sum over i to obtain:

[formula]

taking into account that for every endomorphism A of TM, the 2-form [formula] corresponds to the skew-symmetric endomorphism A - t  A of TM.

Taking ω = u in ([\ref=co]) yields

[formula]

so u and Ru commute (as we assumed n > 3). We then have

[formula]

Since [formula] is skew-symmetric and the equality above holds for every skew-symmetric endomorphism ω, the corollary follows.

Killing vector fields with twistor derivative

We will use the general results above in the particular setting which interests us. No compactness assumption will be needed in this section.

Let ξ be a Killing vector field on M, and denote by u its covariant derivative:

[formula]

By definition, u is a skew-symmetric tensor, which can be identified with [formula]. Taking the covariant derivative in ([\ref=xi]) yields

[formula]

This equation, together with the Kostant formula

[formula]

(which holds for every Killing vector field ξ) shows that

[formula]

Suppose now, and throughout the remaining part of this article, that the covariant derivative u of ξ is a twistor 2-form. Notice that in contrast to Proposition [\ref=ks], we no longer assume the length of ξ to be constant. Taking Y = ξ in ([\ref=f]) and using ([\ref=nf]) yields

[formula]

so δu and ξ are collinear. We denote by f the function defined on the support of ξ satisfying (1 - n)δu = fξ (this normalization turns out to be the most convenient one in the computations below). On the support of ξ the twistor equation ([\ref=f]) then reads

[formula]

Recall now the formula

[formula]

obtained in the previous section. We take the inner product with Y in this formula and sum over an orthonormal basis Y = ei to obtain:

[formula]

Taking the scalar product with some vector Y in this equation and symmetrizing the result yields

[formula]

If we replace Y by u(Y) in this last equation and use Corollary [\ref=cor], we see that the expression

[formula]

is symmetric in X and Y, i.e.

[formula]

A straightforward calculation taking ([\ref=ff]) and ([\ref=sy]) into account yields

[formula]

On the other hand we have [formula] and

[formula]

whence

[formula]

Notice that the norm |u| used here is the norm of u as 2-form, and differs by a factor [formula] from the norm of u as tensor. More explicitly, [formula]. Taking the exterior derivative in ([\ref=gy]) yields

[formula]

which, together with ([\ref=sym]) leads to

[formula]

The main goal of this section is to show the following

Suppose that f is non-constant. Since the support of ξ (say M0) is a dense open subset of M, there exists a non-empty connected open subset U of M0 where df does not vanish. We restrict to U for the computations below. First, ([\ref=dfx]) shows that u(ξ) is collinear to df, which, together with ([\ref=we]) implies that

[formula]

for some function α defined on U.

Differentiating this relation with respect to some vector X and using ([\ref=xi]) and ([\ref=ff]) yields

[formula]

or equivalently

[formula]

In terms of endomorphisms of TM, identified with (2,0)-tensors, ([\ref=jn]) becomes

[formula]

The left hand side of this relation is clearly skew-symmetric. The symmetric part of the right hand side thus vanishes: [formula], whence dα = 2fu(ξ)) on U. Using ([\ref=gy]) we get dα =  - d(|u|2), so

[formula]

for some constant c. We now use ([\ref=jn]) in order to compute the trace of the symmetric endomorphism u2 on TxM for some x∈U. It is clear that ξ and u(ξ) are linearly independent eigenvectors of u2 with eigenvalue α. Let V denote the orthogonal complement of {ξ,u(ξ)} in TxM. For X∈V, ([\ref=jn]) becomes u3(X) - (f|ξ|2  +  α)u(X) = 0, so the minimal polynomial of the endomorphism u|V divides the degree 2 polynomial λ(λ - (f|ξ|2  +  α)). Thus u2 has at most 2 different eigenvalues on V: f|ξ|2  +  α and 0, with multiplicities denoted by k and n - k - 2 respectively. We obtain:

[formula]

showing that either f|ξ|2  +  α is constant or k = 0. In the first case we obtain by taking the exterior derivative

[formula]

This shows that f is constant on U, contradicting the definition of U.

We therefore get k = 0. This means that the restriction of u to the distribution V vanishes, so

[formula]

on U. In particular we get

[formula]

It remains to show that the equation [formula] holds on the entire manifold M, not only on the (possibly small) open set U. This is a consequence of the following remark. The covariant derivatives of the 3-form [formula] and of the 4-form [formula] can be computed at every point of M0 using ([\ref=xi]) and ([\ref=ff]):

[formula]

[formula]

This can be interpreted by saying that the section [formula] of [formula] is parallel with respect to the covariant derivative D on this bundle defined by

[formula]

Since a parallel section which vanishes at some point is identically zero, ([\ref=u]) implies that [formula] vanishes identically on M0, thus on M because M0 is dense in M.

Most of the remaining part of this paper is devoted to the study of the two possibilities given by the above proposition.

The case where f is constant

In this section we consider the case where the function f defined on the support of ξ is constant and we assume that M is compact. We then have

For the reader's convenience we provide here a proof of this rather standard fact. We start by determining the sign of the constant c. From ([\ref=nxi]), ([\ref=nxi2]) and ([\ref=nu]) we obtain

[formula]

Taking the trace over X and Y in this formula yields

[formula]

Now, the two Weitzenböck formulas ([\ref=ff1]) and ([\ref=ff2]) applied to the Killing 1-form ξ read

[formula]

Thus [formula] so taking the scalar product with ξ and integrating over M yields

[formula]

This shows that c is non-negative, and c = 0 if and only if ξ is parallel, a case which is not of interest for us. By rescaling the metric on M if necessary, we can therefore assume that c = 1, i.e. ξ satisfies the Sasakian condition ([\ref=dsa])

[formula]

If the norm of ξ is constant, we are in the presence of a Sasakian structure by Definition [\ref=sa].

Suppose that λ: = |ξ|2 is non-constant. Then the function λ is a characteristic function of the round sphere. More precisely, the second covariant derivative of the 1-form dλ can be computed as follows. Using the relation [formula] we first get dλ =  - 2u(ξ), therefore ([\ref=nu]) gives

[formula]

By taking another covariant derivative with respect to some vector X (at a point where Y is assumed to be parallel) we obtain after a straightforward calculation

[formula]

A classical result of Tanno and Gallot (cf. [\cite=tan] or [\cite=gal]), shows that if dλ does not vanish identically, the sectional curvature of M has to be constant, so M is a finite quotient of the round sphere.

We end up this section by remarking that conversely, every Killing vector field on the round sphere (and all the more on its quotients) satisfies ([\ref=ru]). This follows for instance from [\cite=uwe]. The main idea is that the space of Killing 1-forms (respectively of closed twistor 2-forms) on the sphere coincides with the eigenspace for the least eigenvalue of the Laplace operator on co-closed 1-forms (respectively on closed 2-forms), and the exterior differential defines an isomorphism between these two spaces.

The case where [formula]

From now on we suppose that the function f defined by ([\ref=ff]) is non-constant. By Proposition [\ref=prop] the 3-form [formula] vanishes on M, thus the distribution orthogonal to ξ (defined on the support of ξ) is integrable. We start by a local study of the metric, at points where ξ does not vanish.

By the integrability theorem of Frobenius, M can be written locally as a product I  ×  N where [formula] and N is a local leaf tangent to the distribution [formula]. The metric g can be written

[formula]

for some positive function λ on I  ×  N and some family of Riemannian metrics ht on N. Of course, the fact that [formula] is Killing just means that λ and ht do not depend on t, i.e. g = λ2dt2 + h is a warped product. The 1-form ζ, metric dual to ξ, is just λ2dt, so [formula]. We now express the fact that u is a twistor form on M in terms of the new data (λ,h). Let X denote a generic vector field on N, identified with the vector field on M projecting over it. Similarly, we will identify 1-forms on N with their pull-back on M. Since the projection M  →  N is a Riemannian submersion, these identifications are compatible with the metric isomorphisms between vectors and 1-forms.

The O'Neill formulas (cf. [\cite=on]) followed by a straightforward computation give

[formula]

where we denoted by the same symbol [formula] the covariant derivative of the Levi-Civita connection of h on N. Taking the inner product with X in the second equation and summing over an orthonormal basis of N yields δMu = λΔNλdt, so u is a twistor form if and only if

[formula]

which just means that dλ is a twistor 1-form on N.

We can express the above property of dλ by the fact that its metric dual is a gradient conformal vector field on N. These objects were intensively studied in the 70's by several authors. In particular Bourguignon [\cite=bo] has shown that a compact manifold carrying a gradient conformal vector field is conformally equivalent to the round sphere. The converse of this result does not hold ( i.e. not every conformally flat metric on the sphere carries gradient conformal vector fields, cf. Remark [\ref=re] below). We study this notion in greater detail in the next section.

Gradient conformal vector fields

Let X be a GCVF. Since X is a gradient vector field, its covariant derivative is a symmetric endomorphism, and the fact that X is conformal just means that the trace-free symmetric part of [formula] vanishes. Thus X satisfies the equation

[formula]

where [formula]. In particular, L  Xg = 2αg.

In the neighbourhood of every point where X is non-zero, the metric g can be written

[formula]

for some positive function ψ. Conversely, if g can be written in this form, then [formula] is a GCVF whose primitive is Ψ (the primitive of ψ in the usual sense).

We thus see that the existence of a GCVF does not impose hard restrictions on the metric in general. Remarkably, if the GCVF has zeros, the situation is much more rigid:

Notice that the metric defined by ([\ref=f2]) is in particular of type ([\ref=f1]), as shown by the change of variable [formula].

Let τ be the unit tangent vector field along geodesics passing trough x. From ([\cite=bo]) we have that X is everywhere collinear to τ. Using the Gauss Lemma, we know that the metric g can be expressed as g = ds2 + hs in geodesic coordinates on some neighbourhood U of x, where hs is a family of metrics on Sn - 1 (of course, [formula] in these coordinates). Since x is an isolated zero of X (cf. [\cite=bo]), the norm of X is a smooth function |X| = β defined on U - {x}, and X = βτ. We then compute

[formula]

By identification of the corresponding terms in the above equality we obtain the differential system

[formula]

The first equation shows that β only depends on s: [formula]. The second equation yields

[formula]

for some metric h on Sn - 1.

We claim that h is (up to a scalar multiple) the canonical round metric on the sphere. To see this, we need to understand the family of metrics hs on Sn - 1. We identify (TxM,g) with [formula] and Sn - 1 is viewed as the unit sphere in TxM. If V is a tangent vector to Sn - 1 at some v∈TxM, then hs(V,V) is the square norm with respect to g of the image of V by the homothety of ratio s followed by the differential at v of the exponential map exp x. In other words,

[formula]

Since the differential at the origin of the exponential map is the identity, we get

[formula]

Using this together with ([\ref=ht]) shows that [formula] is a positive real number denoted by c and c2h = gSn  -  1.

We thus have proved that g = ds2  +  γ2(s)gSn  -  1, where [formula].

The classification

We turn our attention back to the original question. Recall that ξ is a non-parallel Killing vector field on (Mn,g) such that [formula] and dξ is a twistor form. We distinguish two cases, depending on whether ξ vanishes or not on M.

Case I. The vector field ξ has no zero on M. The distribution orthogonal to ξ is then globally well-defined and integrable, its maximal leaves turn out to be compact and can be used in order to obtain a dimensional reduction of our problem.

The "if" part follows directly from the local statement given by Proposition [\ref=prl]. Suppose, conversely, that (M,ξ) satisfy the conditions above. We denote by φt the flow of ξ and by Nx the maximal leaf of of the integrable distribution [formula]. Clearly φt maps Nx isometrically over Nφt(x). We claim that this action of [formula] on the space of leaves of [formula] is transitive. Let x∈M be an arbitrary point of M and denote

[formula]

For every y∈Mx we define a map ψ:( - ε,ε)  ×  Ny  →  M by

[formula]

The differential of ψ at (0,y) is clearly invertible, thus the inverse function theorem ensures that the image of ψ contains an open neighbourhood of y in M. On the other hand Mx contains the image of ψ by construction, therefore Mx contains an open neighbourhood of y. Thus Mx is open. For any x,y∈M one either has Mx = My or [formula]. Thus M is a disjoint union of open sets

[formula]

so by connectedness we get Mx = M for all x.

Since the norm of ξ is constant along its flow, we deduce that |ξ| attains its maximum and its minimum on each integral leaf Nx. By the main theorem in [\cite=bo], each leaf is conformally diffeomorphic to the round sphere, so in particular it is compact. Reeb's stability theorem then ensures that the space of leaves is a compact 1-dimensional manifold S and the natural projection M  →  S is a fibration. Hence S is connected, i.e. [formula]. On the other hand we have a group action of [formula] on S given by t(Nx): = Nφt(x) and S is the quotient of [formula] by the isotropy group of some point. Since S is a manifold, this isotropy group has to be discrete, therefore is generated by some [formula]. Then clearly M can be identified with the warped mapping torus Nλ,φ, where N: = Nx, φ: = φt0 and the warping function λ is the restriction to N of |ξ|.

The proof is very similar to that of Theorem [\ref=t8] below and will thus be omitted.

Case II. The vector field ξ has zeros on M. The study of this situation is more involved since the distribution orthogonal to ξ is no longer globally defined. On the other hand one can prove that the orbits of ξ are always closed in this case, which turns out to be crucial for the classification. This follows from a more general statement:

Let Z denote the set of points where ξ vanishes, and let Z0 the connected component of Z containing x. It is well-known that Z0 is a totally geodesic submanifold of M of codimension 2 (equal to the rank of [formula]). Moreover, at each point of Z0, [formula] vanishes on all vectors tangent to Z0.

Since M is compact, its isometry group G is also compact. The Killing vector field ξ defines an element X of the Lie algebra [formula] of G. The exponential map of G send the line [formula] onto a (not necessarily closed) Abelian subgroup of G. Let T be the closure of this subgroup and denote by [formula] its Lie algebra. T is clearly a compact torus. We claim that T is actually a circle. If this were not the case, one could find an element [formula] defining a Killing vector field ζ on M non-collinear to ξ. Let y be some point in Z0. Since by definition ξy = 0 we get exp (tX)  ·   = y for all [formula], whence g  ·   = y for all g∈T, thus showing that ζ vanishes on Z0. Since the space of skew-symmetric endomorphisms of TxM vanishing on TxZ0 is one-dimensional, we deduce that [formula] is proportional to [formula]. Finally, since a Killing vector field is determined by its 1-jet at some point, and ξx  =  ζx = 0, we deduce that ζ is collinear to ξ, a contradiction.

Therefore T is a circle acting isometrically on M and ξ is the Killing vector field induced by this action.

Let M0 denote as before the set of points where ξ does not vanish. The integrable distribution [formula] is well-defined along M0 and T acts freely and transitively on its maximal integral leaves. If (N,h) denotes such a maximal integral leaf, Proposition [\ref=prl] shows that M0 is isometric to the warped product S1  ×  łN, g = λ2dθ2 + h, where λ is a positive function on N whose gradient is a conformal vector field X. Since λ is the restriction of the continuous function |ξ| on M, it attains its maximum at some x∈N. Of course, X vanishes at x.

We thus may apply Proposition [\ref=prds] to the gradient conformal vector field X on N. The metric on N can be written h = ds2  +  γ2(s)gSn  -  2 on some neighbourhood of x. The length of X, which by ([\ref=f2]) is equal to cγ(s), only depends on the distance to x. Assume that X vanishes at some point y: =  exp x(tV) (where V is a unit vector in TxN). Then it vanishes on the whole geodesic sphere of radius t. On the other hand X has only isolated zeros, so the geodesic sphere S(x,t) is reduced to y. This would imply that N is compact, homeomorphic to Sn - 1, so M0 = S1  ×  N is compact, too. On the other hand M0 is open, so by connectedness M0 = M, contradicting the fact that ξ has zeros on M.

This proves that x is the unique zero of X on N. In fact we can now say much more about the global geometry of M. Recall that M is the disjoint union of M0 and Z, where Z, the nodal set of ξ, is a codimension 2 submanifold and M0 = N  ×  S1 is endowed with a warped product metric. In order to state the global result we need the following

Notice that the metric g extends to a continuous metric on Sn. We will see below under which circumstances this extension is smooth.

(i) Consider the isometric action of S1 on M induced by ξ. For θ∈S1 denote by Nθ the image of N through the action of θ on M. Of course, Nθ is itself a maximal integral leaf of [formula]. For every unit vector V∈TxN, we define

[formula]

Clearly, l(x,V) is the distance along the geodesic exp x(tV) from x to the first point on this geodesic where X vanishes. Of course, the exponential map on Nθ coincides (as long as it is defined) with the exponential map on M since each Nθ is totally geodesic. As noticed before, the norm of X along geodesics issued from x only depends on the parameter along the geodesic, therefore l(x,V) is independent of V and can be denoted by l(x). Since we have a transitive isometric action on the Nθ's, l(x) actually does not depend on x neither, and will be denoted by l. This proves that each Nθ is equal to the image of the open ball B(0,l) in Tθ(x)Nθ via the exponential exp θ(x).

(ii) Let us denote by Zθ the set [formula]. By the above, Zθ is the image of the round sphere S(0,l) in Tθ(x)Nθ  ⊂  Tθ(x)M via the exponential map (on M) exp θ(x). In particular, each Zθ is a connected subset of Z, diffeomorphic to Sn - 2. Every element θ'∈S1 maps (by continuity) Zθ to Zθ'θ and on the other hand, it preserves Z. We deduce that Zθ = Zθ' for all θ,θ'∈S1 and since Z is the union of all Zθ, we obtain Z = Zθ. The other assertions are now clear.

(iii) This point is an implicit consequence of the local statements from the previous sections. First, by Proposition [\ref=prl] M0 is diffeomorphic to N  ×  S1 with the warped product metric g = gN  +  λ2dθ2, where λ is a function on N whose gradient X is a GCVF vanishing at x. From Proposition [\ref=prds] and (i) above we see that [formula] is diffeomorphic to (0,l)  ×  Sn - 2 with the metric gN = ds2  +  γ2(s)gSn  -  2. If we denote by S the orbit of x under the S1-action on M defined by ξ, this shows that [formula] is diffeomorphic to (0,l)  ×  Sn - 2  ×  S1 with the metric

[formula]

where λ represents the norm of ξ and [formula]. From ([\ref=bg]) we get |λ'| = |X| = cγ. Taking into account that X does not vanish on [formula], we see that λ' does not change sign on (0,l), so γ equals the derivative of λ up to some non-zero constant. Finally, the boundary conditions ([\ref=equiv1]) are easy to check: [formula], lim s  →  lγ(s) is equal to the radius of the round (n - 2)-sphere Z and is thus positive, lim s  →  0λ(s) = |ξx| > 0 and lim s  →  lλ(s) = 0 because ξ vanishes on Z.

In order to obtain the classification we have to understand which of the above Riemannian join metrics are actually smooth on the entire manifold. For this we will use the following folkloric result

Notice that the above condition on f amounts to say that f(t) = t2 + t4h(t2) for some smooth germ h around 0.

Since λ(0) > 0, g extends to a smooth metric at s = 0 if and only if ds2  +  γ2(s)gSn  -  2 extends smoothly at s = 0. By Lemma [\ref=ext], this is equivalent to γ2(t) = t2 + t4h(t2) for some smooth h, so [formula] for some smooth function a. Similarly, g extends smoothly at s = l if and only if the same holds for ds2  +  λ2(s)dθ2, which, by Lemma [\ref=ext] is equivalent to the existence of some smooth function d defined around 0 such that λ(l - t) = t + t3d(t2). Taking ([\ref=l]) into account, this is of course equivalent to the second part of ([\ref=bou]).

Summarizing, we have

We end up these notes with some open problems related to the classification above. One natural question is the following : which compact Riemannian manifolds carry twistor 1-forms ξ with twistor exterior derivative? To the author's knowledge, in all known examples ξ is either closed or co-closed. In the first case, the metric dual of ξ is a GCVF, so the manifold is described by Proposition [\ref=prds]. The second case just means that ξ is Killing, and the possible manifolds are described by Theorem [\ref=clas].

More generally, one can address the question of classifying all compact Riemannian manifolds Mn carrying a Killing or twistor p-form whose exterior derivative is a non-zero twistor form (2  ≤  p  ≤  n - 2). Besides the round spheres, the only known examples are Sasakian manifolds (for odd p), nearly Kähler 6-manifolds (for p = 2 and p = 3) and nearly parallel G2-manifolds (for p = 3).
