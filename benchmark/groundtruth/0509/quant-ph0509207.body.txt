Quantum Entanglement in the Two Impurity Kondo Model

Introduction

The potential of quantum information processing and quantum communication has led to numerous proposals of specific material systems for the creation and manipulation of entanglement in solid state qubits [\cite=Loss] [\cite=Kane]. Condensed matter systems have several appealing features: (i) natural qubits such as single spin-1/2, (ii) the dream of scaleability found in the solid state technology which is the basis of classical computers, and (iii) the presence of strong interactions between qubits, such as spin exchange, which can create entanglement. Furthermore, even when there is no direct interaction between qubits, the interaction of the individual qubits with their environment can lead to an indirect interaction between qubits [\cite=Fisher]. A concrete example of such an indirect interaction is the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction [\cite=RK] between two localized spins interacting with the itinerant spins in a metal. This has led to several recent proposals to use the RKKY interaction to produce and manipulate entanglement in solid state qubits [\cite=Glazman] [\cite=Marcus] [\cite=Piermarocchi] [\cite=Ardavan].

In considering these proposals for solid state quantum information processing it is important to bear in mind some results from quantum information theory concerning the entanglement in mixed states. Even though entangled states result from interactions and exhibit certain correlations (e.g., antiferromagnetic interactions can produce singlet states which exhibit antiferromagnetic correlations) such interactions and correlations are necessary but not sufficient for the presence of entanglement. In particular, Werner [\cite=Werner] defined a sub-class of mixed states of pairs of qudits that had two particularly interesting sub-families. One family of states had "classical" correlations in the sense that the two-qudit density matrix could be written as a convex combination of product (i.e., unentangled) states. Such states can be modeled by a hidden-variable theory and satisfy Bell's inequalities. A second distinct subfamily were entangled but could be modeled by a hidden variable theory. In this paper, we consider the implications of this for the specific case of the two-impurity Kondo model, which describes the interaction of two localized spin-1/2's (qubits) interact via the Heisenberg exchange interaction with the itinerant electrons in a metal. We investigate how the competition between the Kondo effect [\cite=Hewson] and the RKKY interaction determines the parameter regime for which entanglement of the two qubits can occur. Although we focus on this specific system many of the results and concepts considered can be readily adapted to other solid state qubit systems. For example, this is another example of how the entanglement in the whole system is "shared" [\cite=Dawson]: the extent to which two qubits can be entangled with each other is limited by how entangled the individual qubits are with the environment.

Manipulation of many-body quantum states in solid state physics has come to reality. For example, the Kondo effect [\cite=Kouwen] and superconducting qubits [\cite=superconductor] have been realized experimentally in a controllable manner. For a quantum dot (QD) fabricated in a semiconductor two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) system, system parameters can be varied in a tunable manner [\cite=Bird] to explore various many-body effects in previously inaccessible regimes. Electron transport through QD's in the unitary limit has manifested that the ground state is a many-body Kondo singlet [\cite=Yosida66] as a result of the Kondo resonance [\cite=Wiel] [\cite=Ji]. This means that the localized magnetic moment is entangled with the itinerant electrons. Further, it has recently been proposed that a tunable RKKY interaction could be used to entangle two spatially separated spins and perform quantum information processing (QIP) electrically [\cite=Glazman] [\cite=Marcus] or optically [\cite=Piermarocchi] in coupled QDs or with endohedral fullerenes inside carbon nanotubes [\cite=Ardavan]. Varying the RKKY interaction, to induce the effect of transitions between different ground states has been theoretically investigated [\cite=Simon] [\cite=Vavilov]. Furthermore, quantifying entanglement in quantum many-body systems has recently been investigated [\cite=Sorensen] [\cite=Osterloh] [\cite=Osborne] [\cite=Ghosh] [\cite=Hines03] [\cite=Costi] [\cite=Barnum] [\cite=Falco] [\cite=Hines04] [\cite=Jordan] [\cite=Wu] [\cite=Vidal04] [\cite=Hines05] [\cite=Yang]. Motivated by a recent experiment of nonlocal spin control in a coupled-QD system [\cite=Marcus], it is important to understand how two spatially separated spins are entangled by tunable quantum many-body effects. To help the answer, we quantify quantum entanglement in two impurity Kondo systems. The outline of the paper is as follows. A general expression for the reduced density matrix for the two impurity spins is given in terms of the spin-spin correlation. It is found that to be entangled the two impurity spins need a minimum non-zero antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlation determined by the competition between the Kondo effect and the RKKY interaction. We point out that at the unstable fixed point [\cite=Jones88] in the two impurity Kondo problem the AFM correlation has this critical value.

The two impurity Kondo model

The two impurity Kondo model describes two localized spins interacting with itinerant conduction electrons. One may then suppose that the total system has three subsystems, consisting of the two localized spins (A and B) and the conduction electrons (C) as the environment (See Fig. [\ref=2spin]). The Hamiltonian describing the two impurity Kondo model is

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the Hamiltonian for the conduction electrons. J is the spin exchange coupling between the impurity spins [formula] and the conduction-electron spin densities, [formula], at the impurity sites A and B, where Ne is the number of different [formula] vectors. The relevant energy scale governing a single spin impurity model is the Kondo temperature [\cite=Hewson], [formula], with the conduction band width, D, and the single-particle density of states at the Fermi energy ϱF. The conduction electron spins mediate a spin exchange interaction between the two spatially separated impurity spins, the RKKY interaction, even though it does not explicitly appear in Eq. ([\ref=model]) of the Hamiltonian. To second order in J, the RKKY interaction between two impurity spins can be described by the Hamiltonian

[formula]

where I(R) characterizes the effective spin-exchange interaction between the two impurity spins depending on the distance R. The exchange interaction varies as I(R) = 4πJ2εFF1,3(2kFR) with F3(x)  =  ( sin x  -  x cos x) / x4 in three dimensions [\cite=Kittel] and [formula] in one dimension [\cite=Yafet]. εF and kF are the Fermi energy and the Fermi wavevector, respectively. Recently the RKKY interaction in single-walled nanotubes has been studied [\cite=Shenoy] theoretically. Note that the sign of I(R) depends on the distance R between the two impurity spins. AFM coupling occurs for I(R) > 0 and ferromagnetic (FM) coupling occurs for I(R) < 0. The competition between the RKKY interaction and Kondo effect determines the characteristics of the system by the ratio of the relevant energy scales, I(R) / TK. For instance, for a strong ferromagnetic RKKY interaction, |I|  ≫  TK, the two stage Kondo effect [\cite=Jayaprakash] is seen in the temperature dependence of susceptibility, there are three distinct temperatures at which the susceptibility decreases. The ratio I(R) / TK can be varied by changing J or R.

Reduced density matrix for the two impurity spins

At zero temperature (T = 0), the total system should be in a ground state, [formula], which is pure. The ground state should be a spin singlet [\cite=Jones88]. This means that it is invariant under joint rotation of all the spins. To quantify entanglement between the two localized spins, let [formula] be the density matrix for the ground state of the total system. Although the total system is in a pure state, the two localized spins are in a mixed state. For any two qubits, here two Kondo impurity spins [formula] and [formula], the density matrix can be written in the form [\cite=Nielsen],

[formula]

where the coefficients in this operator expansion are determined by the relation

[formula]

σ0j and σμj (μ = x,y,z) are the identity matrix and the Pauli matrices, respectively and j = A and B. The reduced (four by four) density matrix ρAB is obtained from ρ by taking the partial trace over the states of subsystem C (conduction electrons). All influences of the direct and indirect interactions between the two Kondo spins are contained in the correlation functions defined by the coefficients rαβ.

For the two Kondo spins, we derive a general expression for the reduced density matrix which is valid when any total system considered satisfies the following symmetries. The reflection symmetry of the system implies that ρAB  =  ρBA. Since the Hamiltonian describing the system is real, ρ*AB  =  ρBA. Furthermore, if the ground state is a total spin singlet, i.e., spin rotationally invariant, then rαβ = 0 if α  ≠  β and rxx = ryy = rzz = r. The symmetries require that the only nonzero coefficients in the operator expansion are r00, rxx, ryy, and rzz. In addition, [formula] because the density matrix must have trace unity. The reduced density matrix may depend only on the distance R between the two Kondo impurity spins [formula] and [formula] because in our study the indirect RKKY interaction between the Kondo impurity spins is mediated by the conduction electrons. In the basis [formula], the reduced density matrix ρAB can be rewritten entirely in terms of the spin-spin correlation function, [formula], as follows,

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the four by four identity matrix.

To get more insight into the entanglement for the two impurity Kondo system, we rewrite the reduced density matrix in the Bell basis of maximally entangled states [formula], where [formula] and [formula]. Note that [formula] is the spin singlet state. The result is

[formula]

where ps  =  1 / 4 - fs and pt  =  1 / 4 + fs / 3. This state is a singlet-triplet mixture. The spin-spin correlation function of any two spins is bounded:  - 3 / 4  ≤  fs  ≤  1 / 4. Thus, the probabilities for the singlet and three triplet states are 0  ≤  ps  ≤  1 and 0  ≤  pt  ≤  1 / 3. The spin-spin correlation determines the properties of the state for the two spins. The probability of the two spins being in a singlet state is P(S) = ps = 1 / 4 - fs and the total probability of triplet states is P(T) = 3pt = 3 / 4 + fs. In the limit of a pure AFM singlet of the two spins, i.e., fs =  - 3 / 4, the two spins are in a maximally entangled state; [formula], with P(S) = 1 and P(T) = 0. While in the limit of no singlets, i.e., fs = 1 / 4, the two spins are in a equal mixture of three triplet states; [formula], with P(S) = 0 and P(T) = 1. However, the concurrence/negativity for this particular mixture of triplet states is zero as will be discussed below. When the spin-spin correlation vanishes, i.e., fs  =  0, the reduced density matrix becomes [formula], the totally mixed density matrix which is "garbage" for QIP. Then there is no entanglement between the two spins. In this case, the probabilities for the singlet and triplet states are P(S) = 1 / 4 and P(T) = 3 / 4. When the probabilities for the singlet and triplet states are equal, i.e., P(S) = P(T) = 1 / 2, the spin-spin correlation is fcs =  - 1 / 4. The state for the two localized spins can be regarded as an equal mixture of the total spin of impurities Simp = 0 and Simp = 1.

Concurrence/Negativity and a critical value of correlation

ρAB is actually a Werner state [\cite=Werner] and can be written as

[formula]

This state is characterized by a single parameter ps called the fidelity because ps  =  〈Ψ-|ρAB|Ψ-〉 measures the overlap of the Werner state with the spin singlet Bell state. One measure of entanglement is the concurrence [\cite=Wootters98]. For the Werner state ρAB, the concurrence is given by [\cite=Wootters98]

[formula]

For 0  ≤  ps  ≤  1 / 2 (i.e.,  - 1 / 4  ≤  fs  ≤  1 / 4), the concurrence is zero and the reduced density matrix can be written as a convex combination of (disentangled) product states. For 1 / 2  ≤  ps  ≤  1 (i.e.,  - 3 / 4  ≤  fs  ≤   - 1 / 4), the concurrence ranges from zero to one (a maximally entangled state), and it is related to the spin-spin correlation function monotonically. Therefore, at pcs = 1 / 2, there exists a critical value of the spin-spin correlation, fcs  =   - 1 / 4, separating entangled states from unentangled states. In a quantum spin system, a critical value of spin-spin correlation has been discussed for a system consisting of a spin S and a spin 1/2 [\cite=Schliemann]. Another important measure of entanglement is the negativity N(ρAB) [\cite=Zyc] [\cite=Vidal]. Similarly to the concurrence, the negativity ranges from zero to one. The negativity of the Werner state [\cite=Lee] is equal to the concurrence,

[formula]

Hence, the negativity gives exactly the same critical value of the spin-spin correlation for the absence of entanglement. In fact, any measure of the entanglement shows that the critical value of the spin-spin correlation, fcs  =   - 1 / 4, is a unique point for the two impurity Kondo problem. We will see below that the critical correlation can be related to the unstable fixed point in the two impurity Kondo model [\cite=Jones88].

Quantum teleportation, Bell inequalities, and correlation

There are rigid constraints on the value of the spin-spin correlation required to use the two Kondo impurities for QIP. The state of Eq. ([\ref=R3]) for two Kondo impurities is a Werner state that is highly symmetric and [formula]-invariant [\cite=Werner] [\cite=Bennett]. The Werner state can be entangled but not violate any Bell inequality (i.e., be described by a hidden variable theory) for some values of the fidelity ps. In fact, a Werner state with [formula] satisfies the Clauser-Horne-Shinmony-Holt (CHSH) inequality [\cite=CHSH] [\cite=Horodecki95], i.e., does not have the non-local correlations characteristic of maximally entangled states. This criterion corresponds to [formula] in the two impurity Kondo system. The values of the spin-spin correlation, for an entangled state without the violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality, is determined by the concurrence/negativity. The entangled state, for fs  <   - 1 / 4, can then be used for QIP including teleportation [\cite=Popescu] [\cite=Lee00]. To provide a clear comparison of criteria in terms of the spin-spin correlation for the two impurity Kondo problem, Table [\ref=table] shows values required for Bell inequalities, quantum teleportation, and entanglement.

We summarize pictorially the main results of this study; the relations between the concurrence/negativity and the probabilities of the states for two impurity spins as a function of the spin-spin correlation is shown in the top panel of Fig. [\ref=summary].

Relationship between concurrence/negativity and quantum phase transitions

A connection between entanglement and quantum phase transition(QPT)s has been proposed for a particular class of Hamiltonians [\cite=Wu]. For first- and second-order QPTs, there occurs a discontinuity in the ground-state concurrence/negativity and its first derivative, respectively, due to non-analyticities in the ground state energy. In the case of the two impurity Kondo problem, the concurrence/negativity is a continuous function and its first derivative has a discontinuity at the critical value of spin-spin correlation. However, the discontinuity does not come from non-analyticity in the ground state energy but from the requirement of non-negative concurrence [\cite=Yang] or non-positive negativity. Consequently, in general, the critical point of the spin-spin correlation in the concurrence/negativity is not necessarily related to a QPT [\cite=Wu]. Thus, to use the concurrence/negativity as a signature of QPTs, the non-analyticities in the ground state energy should occur at values of spin-spin correlation - 3 / 4  ≤  fs  ≤   - 1 / 4, even if the two impurity Kondo system has a definite QPT. Otherwise, since the concurrence/negativity is zero for - 1 / 4  ≤  fs  ≤  1 / 4, We see that non-analytic behavior of the concurrence/negativity is not a definitive signature of a QPT.

Vanishing entanglement at a quantum critical point

We now consider how the vanishing entanglement at fcs =  - 1 / 4 may relate to the unstable fixed point (QPT) of the two-impurity Kondo model found by Jones, Varma, and Wilkins [\cite=Jones88]. Wilson's numerical renormalization-group technique [\cite=Jones88] and conformal field theory approaches [\cite=Ludwig], have shown that at the unstable fixed point, the staggered susceptibility and the specific heat coefficient, γ, diverge, this critical value of (I / TK)c. This critical value separates the regimes of renormalization group flows to the stable Kondo effect fixed point for I / TK  >  (I / TK)c and the locked-impurity singlet fixed point for I / TK  <  (I / TK)c [\cite=Jayaprakash]. It should be stressed that this critical point only exists when there is a symmetry between even and odd parity channels [\cite=Jones88] [\cite=Gan] [\cite=Silva]. The divergence of thermodynamic properties implies that, at and around the unstable fixed point, a local description of the impurity and conduction electron degrees of freedom in terms of a local Fermi-liquid is not possible. Interestingly, in addition, the spin-spin correlation of the ground state varies continuously as a function of I / TK and, at the unstable fixed point (I / TK)c, approaches the critical value of fcs  =   - 1 / 4 within numerical accuracy in the wide range of values of TK [\cite=Jones88]. This value at the critical point was also found analytically [\cite=Silva]. The schematics in the top and bottom panels of Fig. [\ref=summary] show a correspondence between the entanglement and renormalization group flow for the two impurity Kondo system. When the symmetry of even-odd parity is broken the critical point is replaced by a crossover [\cite=Gan] [\cite=Silva]. This might suggest that the quantum entanglement for this two impurity Kondo problem plays a important role in this quantum phase transition. However, if the even-odd symmetry is not present then the entanglement still vanishes for a critical value of (I / TK)c but there is no quantum phase transition [\cite=Gan] [\cite=Silva].

Entanglement between the conduction electrons and the Kondo impurities

The von Neumann entropy [\cite=Nielsen] is a good measure of entanglement between two subsystems of a pure state [formula] [\cite=Bennett96]. Although above we considered the total system in terms of the three subsystems (two impurity spins A and B, and the conduction electrons C), it can also be regarded as a bipartite system having two subsystems A and B. There are two options (i) one impurity spin (A = j) and the remainder of the total system ([formula]) or (ii) two impurity spins ([formula]) and the conduction electrons (B = C). For the pure state [formula] of the bipartite systems, the von Neumann entropy [formula] is given by the density matrix associated with either of the two subsystems, i.e., E(ρA) = E(ρB). The logarithm is taken in the base 2.

To quantify the entanglement of one impurity spin (j) with the remainder (j'  C) of the total system, the reduced (two by two) density matrix of the one impurity spin, [formula], needs to be evaluated by taking trace over the state of the remainder of the total system. In terms of the Pauli matrices, it has the form [formula] with rα  =  〈σαj〉. As expected, ρA  =  ρB  =  σ0j / 2 because the expectation value of each impurity spin is zero, 〈σαj〉 = 0, due to the spin-rotational invariance of the system. Then we have

[formula]

Note that the von Neumann entropy of each impurity spin is not dependent on the spin-spin correlation fs of the two impurity spins. Hence, each Kondo spin is always maximally entangled with the remainder of the total system [\cite=Costi]. The entanglement of two impurity spins (A and B) with the conduction electrons (C) is quantified by the von Neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix ρAB,

[formula]

Figure [\ref=entropy] shows the von Neumann entropy, E(ρAB), and the singlet fidelity, ps, as a function of the spin-spin correlation, fs. When fs =  - 3 / 4 (ps = 1), E(ρAB) = 0 and the two Kondo spins are completely disentangled from the conduction electrons. The maximum degree of the entanglement of one Kondo spin with the remainder of the total system is then attributed to the other Kondo spin rather than the conduction electron spins. The concurrence, C(ρAB) = 1, as a measure of the entanglement between the two Kondo spins shows that they form the AFM spin-singlet state in the limit of I / TK  ≪  0, as shown in Ref. [\cite=Jayaprakash]. In the language of Kondo screening, one Kondo spin perfectly screens the other Kondo spin and the conduction electrons do not participate in screening any Kondo spin. As the RKKY interaction increases up to I / TK = 0, i.e., ps = 1 / 4, the entropy of Eq. ([\ref=entropy2]) increases monotonically and reaches its maximum value of 2. As discussed, each Kondo spin is always maximally entangled with the conduction electrons but the entanglement of two Kondo spins disappears for fs  ≥   - 1 / 4. Thus, partial screenings by one Kondo spin and the conduction electrons accomplish a complete screening of the other Kondo spin. In fact, the competition between the Kondo effect, TK, and the RKKY interaction, I, determines to what extent partial screening of one Kondo spin by the other Kondo spin and the conduction electron spins. At fs = 0 (ps = 1 / 4), i.e., I / TK = 0, the two Kondo spins are maximally entangled with the conduction electrons but no entanglement between them exists. As the spin-spin correlation (RKKY interaction) increases to I / TK  →    ∞  , i.e., ps = 0, the entropy of Eq. ([\ref=entropy2]) decreases gradually to E(ρAB) =  log 23 in the limit of the FM spin-triplet state. As a result, the entanglements of (i) one Kondo spin and the remainder of the total system and (ii) two Kondo spins and the conduction electrons exist in the whole range of the spin-spin correlation, and do not show any signatures of the unique behavior of the two impurity Kondo system at the unstable fixed point (I / TK)c, i.e., fcs =  - 1 / 4.

Conclusions

Any system of two spins which are a subsystem of a spin-rotationally invariant state will have similar entanglement properties. To our knowledge, this is the first discussion of an experimental solid-state realization of a Werner state. This work has significant implications for proposals using the RKKY interaction for QIP. We have shown that it is not sufficient to just use the RKKY interaction to produce antiferromagnetic correlations between spins. Entanglement will only be created when the AFM correlations are larger than a critical non-zero value. Hence, it is important that realistic estimates be made for the ratio I / TK for candidate systems [\cite=Marcus] [\cite=Piermarocchi] [\cite=Ardavan].
