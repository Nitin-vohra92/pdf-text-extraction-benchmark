In [\cite=WL] the following question was posed:

Question. For every maximal subgroup M of a group G assume that Sec(M) is supersolvable. Is G solvable?

For solving this Question we need some definitions and lemmas.

Definition 1[\cite=WL]. Let M be a maximal subgroup of a finite group G and K / L be a chief factor such that L  ≤  M while [formula]. We call the group [formula] a c - section of M.

We say that there is a unique class of subgroups U in a group G, if every subgroup isomorphic to U is conjugate to U in G.

Lemma 1[\cite=WL]. For any maximal subgroup M of a group G, there is a unique c - section of M up to isomorphism.

By Lemma 1, it is reasonable to introduce the following:

Definition 2[\cite=WL]. Given a maximal subgroup M of a group G, we define Sec(M) as the abstract group that is isomorphic to a c - section of M.

Similar to the proof of [\cite=H] and of (1) in the proof of [\cite=H], we get Lemma 2.

Lemma 2. (a) For n  ≠  4, 1 < k < n, An has no subgroup of index k.

(b) For every subgroup U of index n in An , there exists an automorphism α of An such that Uα = V1, where [formula]

Lemma 3. If n  ≠  6, the subgroups of index n in alternative group Anare conjugate in An.

Proof. Since n  ≠  6, by [\cite=H] there exist n subgroups of index n in Sn and they are conjugate in Sn. Let U is a subgroup in An of index n. Since [formula] and An (n  ≠  4) is simple, [formula] is a subgroup of Sn of index n by Lemma 2(b). Moreover Sn - 1 has only one subgroup of index 2. Thus there exactly exist n subgroups of index n in An. Then these subgroups are conjugate in An.

The following example gives a negative answer for the above Question.

Example Groups

[formula]

are the counterexamples of the Question, where [formula] and [formula].

Proof  In the following, p is always a prime with [formula]. Let G = PGL2(p), K = L2(p). We know that G = K.〈α〉, where α is an outer automorphism of order 2 of K.

By [\cite=H], K has two conjugacy classes of elementary abelian subgroups T of type (2,2) and |NK(T)| = 24. By [\cite=H], PGL2(p) is contained in L2(p2) = :F, then NK(T)  ≤  NG(T)  ≤  NF(T). Thus, |NG(T)| = 24 since |NF(T)| = 24 by [\cite=H] again. It follows that |G:NG(T)| = 2|K:NK(T)|, then all the elementary abelian subgroups of type (2,2) in K are conjugate in G. Therefore, [formula] interchanges the two conjugacy classes of elementary abelian subgroups of type (2,2) in L2(p). Especially, Tα and T can't be conjugate in K.

Evidently, [formula] is the unique chief series of G. Let M be a maximal subgroup of G (denoted M <   ·   G). If M = K, then Sec(M) = 1. So we may assume [formula]. Then [formula] and G = KM. Hence, there exist elements k∈K and m∈M such that α = km. Then Tm and T cannot be conjugate in K.

By [\cite=H], the maximal subgroups of K are isomorphic to S4, A5, or supersolvable. Hence, if Sec(M) is not supersolvable, then Sec(M) is isomorphic to S4, A5, or A4. Assume that T  ≤  Sec(M), then [formula]. On the other hand, all elementary abelian subgroups T of type (2,2) in A5, S4, or A4 are conjugate in them respectively. Then Tm and T are conjugate in K, a contradiction.

Therefore, Sec(M) is supersolvable for each M <   ·   G.

Now, we give a complete answer to the Question:

Theorem. Let G be a finite group. For every maximal subgroup M of G, assume that Sec(M) is supersolvable.Then any composition factor of G is isomorphic to L2(p) or Zq, where p and q are primes, and [formula].

We need the following lemma.

Lemma 4. Suppose that G = SL(n,pf),f > 1 and P∈Sylp(G). Let L = Ln(p) and P1∈Sylp(L). Then NG(P) and NL(P1) are non-supersolvable.

Proof. By [\cite=H], we may assume that P consists of the following matrices:

[formula]

Then the normalizer of P in G is consists of the following matrices:

[formula]

where [formula]

Let [formula] and D∈NG(P). Let Eij be a matrix having a lone 1 as its (i,j)-entry and all other entries 0, where i  ≠  j. Then

[formula]

And it is evident that N = {E + aEn,1|a∈GF(pf)} is a subgroup of the group of all matrices of n rank with respect to matrix multiplication. Hence N is a normal subgroup of NG(P).

In case n > 2, we can get that an,n = 1. Thus, if a  ≠  0 then aa- 1n,na11 = aa11 runs over GF(pf) when a11 runs over GF(pf). Therefore N is a minimal normal subgroup of NG(P). If n = 2, then a- 1n,n = a11. Thus aa- 1n,na11 = aa211. It follows that |{aa211|a11∈GF(pf)}|  ≥  pf - 1 if p = 2 and [formula] if p is odd for a  ≠  0. Then N is also a minimal normal subgroup of NG(P) when n = 2 since |N| = pf. Therefore, NG(P) is not supersolvable for f > 1.

Since [formula] and [formula], similar to above, we also have that NL(P1) is not supersolvable for f > 1.

Proof of the Theorem. Suppose that the Theorem is false. Then there exists a minimal counterexample. Let G be a minimal counterexample.

(1)  G has the unique minimal normal subgroup N and [formula], where [formula] is a non-abelian simple group.

By Lemma 1, Sec(M / N) is supersolvable for every normal subgroup M / N of G / N, thus G / N satisfies the hypotheses of the Theorem . Hence any composition factor of G / N is isomorphic to L2(p) or Zq. Thus G has the unique minimal normal subgroup N since any composition factor of [formula] is isomorphic to a composition factor of G / K or G / L, where K and L are normal subgroup of G. And N is non-abelian since G is a minimal counterexample. Therefore, [formula], where [formula] is non-abelian simple group.

(2)  Without loss of generality, we may assume that [formula], N = Soc(G).

By [\cite=DH], G might be considered as a subgroup Inn(G) (the inner automorphism group of N) of [formula]. Let M1 be a maximal subgroup of Aut(N1) such that [formula], then [formula] and [formula]. Thus [formula] and G has a maximal subgroup M that contains [formula]. Hence G = MN and [formula]. Then [formula]. By the hypothesis of the theorem, Sec(M) is supersolvable and thus [formula] is supersolvable. Hence Aut(N1) satisfies the hypothesis of the theorem. On the other hand, since Aut(N1) / N1 is solvable by Schreier conjecture and G / N satisfies the Theorem, any composition of G is isomorphic to L2(p), Zq, or N1, where [formula] and [formula].

Hence, if G is a counterexample of the Theorem then Aut(N1) is also a counterexample of the Theorem; if G isn't a counterexample of the Theorem then Aut(N1) isn't a counterexample of the Theorem. Therefore, we may assume that [formula] and N = N1.

In the following, [formula], N = Soc(G).

(3) Every maximal subgroup M of G such that [formula] is soluble. And [formula] is supersolvable.

Since [formula] is soluble and Sec(M) is supersolvable by the hypothesis of the Theorem, then M is soluble.

Evidently, by (3) we get (4):

(4) If there is a proper subgroup H of G such that HN = G, then H is soluble and [formula] is supersolvable.

(5)  Let 1  ≠  U be a proper subgroup of N. If there is a unique class of subgroups U in N then U is supersolvable.

Set

[formula]

Since there is a unique class of subgroups U in N, both G and N transitively act on Γ by conjugation. Therefore, G = NG(U)N by Frattini Argument. Then, by (4) NG(U) is soluble and [formula] is supersolvable.

We analyse it case by case:

Case(A) N = An, n  ≥  5. If n  ≠  6 then G = Sn. Evidently, both G and N act on [formula] transitively, by Frattini argument, G = NSn - 1. Thus, by (4), [formula] is supersolvable, a contradiction. If n = 6, from [\cite=CNPW], G doesn't satisfy the hypothesis of the Theorem by (3).

Case(B) N = L2(q),q = pf > 3. If f > 1, then NG(P) is not supersolvable by Lemma 4. If [formula],i.e. [formula], then there is a unique class of subgroups A4 in L2(p). Thus [formula], or f = 1 and [formula] by (5). On the other hand, by Example, G satisfies the Theorem if [formula].

Case(C) N = Ln(q),n > 2. Since [formula], we suppose (n,q)  ≠  (3,2). By [\cite=A], G = NG(M)PGLn(q) = NG(M)Ln(q), where we choose [formula]. Evidently [formula] has a section isomorphic to Ln - 1(q). But by (4) [formula] is supersolvable. Then (n,q) = (3,2).

Case(D) N = Un(q),n  ≥  3. Since G  ≤  PΓLn(q), both G and Un(q) transitively act on the set of nonsingular subspaces of dimension i by Witt's theorem. Define Ni to be the stabilizer of a nonsingular space of dimension i in G. Then G = N1N by Frattini argument and thus N1 is soluble. On the other hand, both N1 and [formula] have a section isomorphic to Un - 1(q). Then (n,q) = (3,2) by (4). If N = U3(2), G does not satisfy the hypothesis by [\cite=CNPW].

Case(E) N = PSp4(q),q = 2f > 2. Let P∈Syl2(N). From [\cite=A], there is a M <   ·  G such that [formula]. By (3), NN(P) is supersolvable and then NN(P) = P  ×  H, where H is a 2-complement of NN(P). From [\cite=LPS], we get that |NN(P)| = q4(q - 1)2. So |H| = (q - 1)2. Let r is the largest prime divisor of |H| and R∈Sylr(H). Then PR = P  ×  R is a nilpotent Hall {2,r}-subgroup of N. By [\cite=H], we can consider PSp2(q2) as a subgroup of N. Let T = PSp2(q2) and P1∈Syl2(T), R1∈Sylr(T). Since |N| = q4(q + 1)2(q - 1)2(q2 + 1) and |T| = q2(q - 1)(q + 1)(q2 + 1), from [\cite=Wie], we may assume that P1R1  ≤  PR. Thus CT(P1)  ≥  R1 > 1, contrary to CT(P1) = 1.

Case(F) N = PSp2m(q),m > 2 or m = 2 and q odd. Then G  ≤  PΓLn(q). Both G and Un(q) transitively act on the set of totally singular i-subspaces for each i by Witt's theorem. Define Pi to be the stabilizer of a totally singular i-space in G. Then G = P1N by Frattini argument. On the other hand, both P1 and [formula] have a section isomorphic to PSp2(m - 1)(q). Then PSp2(m - 1)(q) is soluble by (4), a contradiction.

Case(G) N = PΩ2m + 1(q),m  ≥  3,q odd. Define Ni to be the stabilizer of a nonsingular space of dimension i in G. Similar to Case N = Un(q),n  ≥  3, we get that N1 is soluble and N1 has a section isomorphic to PΩ+2m(q) or PΩ-2m(q), a contradiction.

Case(H) N = PΩ+8(q). By [\cite=K], there is a unique class of subgroups R1 in N, where R1 to be the stabilizer of a totally singular 1-space in N. Then R1 is supersolvable by (5) but R1 has a section isomorphic to PΩ+6(q), a contradiction.

Case(I) N = PΩ+2m(q),m > 4. Then G  ≤  PΓLn(q). Both G and N transitively act on the set of totally singular i-subspaces for each i by Witt's theorem. Define Pi to be the stabilizer of a totally singular i-space in G. Then G = P2N by Frattini argument. On the other hand, P2 has a section isomorphic to PΩ+2(m - 1)(q). Then PSp2(m - 1)(q) is soluble by (4), a contradiction.

Case(J) N = PΩ-2m(q),m  ≥  4. Similar to Case N = PΩ+2m(q),m > 4.

Case(K) N is an exceptional group of Lie type:

Subcase(a) [formula]. Let P∈Sylp(N). From [\cite=Su], we know that NN(P) is a Frobenius group of order 22(2m + 1)(22m + 1 - 1) and NN(P) is supersolvable by (5), a contradiction.

Subcase(b) [formula]. In this case the Sylow 2-subgroup P of N is abelian. In addition, NN(P) is supersolvable by (5). Thus NN(p) = CN(P). Hence N is 2-nilpotent by the well-known theorem of Burnside and then N is soluble by the odd order theorem, a contradiction.

Subcase(c) N = G2(q). From [\cite=LS], there is a unique class of subgroups SL3(q) in G2(q) if [formula]; there is a unique class of subgroups [formula] in G2(q) if q = 32m + 1; there is a unique class of subgroups G2(qm) in G2(q) if q = 32m, which contradicts (5).

Subcase(d) [formula]. From [\cite=LS], there is a unique class of subgroups G2(q) in N, which contradicts (5).

Subcase(e) [formula] or [formula]. If [formula], from [\cite=CNPW], we get that G does not satisfy the hypothesis by (3). If [formula], by [\cite=M], there is just one class of subgroups L2(25) in N. Hence L2(25) is supersolvable by (5), a contradiction.

Subcase(f) N = F4(q). If q is odd, from [\cite=LS], there is a unique conjugacy class of subgroups B4(q) in G2(q). If q = 2m, by [\cite=Gu], NN(S) = SH is a group of order q24(q - 1)4 and CH(S) = 1, where S∈Syl2(N) and |H| = (q - 1)4. However, by (5), NN(S) is supersolvable and thus 2-nilpotent. Then NN(S) = S  ×  H, contrary to CH(S) = 1 when q > 2. When q = 2, from [\cite=CNPW], we get that G can't satisfy the hypotheses by (3).

Subcase(g) [formula], E6(q),E7(q) or E8(q). In this case, there is a unique class of non-soluble subgroups in N by [\cite=LS], which contradicts (5).

Case(L) N is a sporadic simple groups.

If the outer automorphism group Out(N) = 1, then G = N cannot satisfy the hypothesis by [\cite=H]. Hence, we only consider the sporadic simple groups N such that Out(N) = 2 since |G / N|  ≤  2 and then, from [\cite=CNPW], we get that G does not satisfy the hypothesis by (3).

Therefore the minimal counterexample is not existence and the theorem is proved.
