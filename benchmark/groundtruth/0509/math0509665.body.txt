The Extension of Knot Groups to Tangles

Introduction

One of the better-known invariants of knots and links is the "knot group" [formula], defined as the fundamental group of the complement of a knot or link in S3 [\cite=MR0176462]. One would like to extend this invariant to tangles. That is: to define a functor Γ from Tang - the category of tangles - to an appropriate target category so that its restriction to hom Tang(0,0) - knots and links - is essentially the same as the knot group function. Since Tang has a simple presentation generators and relations as a tensor category, this will allow a new computation of the knot group of a given knot or link, and more importantly a new avenue of proof for results on knot groups.

The naïve choice of [formula] for the target category is obviously incorrect. Groups are objects in [formula], while tangles are morphisms in Tang. As a first step, then, one must construct a category in which (essentially) groups are the morphisms.

The Λ construction

Let C be a category with pushouts. Construct a new category ΛC with the same objects as C, but with new morphism sets where two diagrams [formula] and [formula] are considered isomorphic if there is an isomorphism γ from O1 to O2 such that [formula] and [formula], as in Figure [\ref=fig:isomcomp].

Given a morphism from A to B and one from B to C, define their composition by splicing diagrams at B and pushing out g1 and f2 as in Figure [\ref=fig:isomcomp]. Pushouts are only defined uniquely up to isomorphism, which is why morphisms in ΛC must be defined as isomorphism classes of diagrams.

Considering three morphisms and both orders of composition, it is easily verified that both compositions P1 and P2 (see Figure [\ref=fig:assoc]) are limits of the diagram composed of the original morphisms, and so are isomorphic. The identity diagram for an object A is [formula].

There exists a faithful functor λ from C to ΛC

Set λ(A)  =  A and [formula]. This is clearly a functor, so it remains to show faithfulness. But if two diagrams from A to B in the image of λ are isomorphic, the isomorphism on the middle object must be the identity, and so the arrows from A must be identical.

Now let [formula] be a tensor product (associative bifunctor with identity object [formula] up to natural isomorphism) on C which commutes with pushouts. This extends naturally to a tensor product on ΛC. Indeed, [formula] is a morphism from [formula] to [formula], and the pushout of the tensor product of two arrows is the tensor product of their pushouts by assumption, proving functoriality. The identity diagram on [formula] acts as a tensor identity in ΛC, and associativity is easily checked.

Conversely, given any tensor product structure on ΛC, we can recover one on C by restricting to the image of λ. It evidently preserves pushouts. This proves

Tensor product structures on ΛC correspond bijectively with tensor product structures on C that preserve pushouts.

The functor Γ

The category [formula] has pushouts, as well as an associative (up to natural isomorphism), unital (again, up to isomorphism) bifunctor preserving them: the coproduct, better known as the free product. This will induce a tensor structure on [formula], and this structure will be assumed in the sequel. The tensor identity is the single element group [formula].

Tang has as objects the natural numbers with addition acting as a monoidal product. A tangle from m to n is an isotopy class of collections of [formula] arcs and any number of circles embedded into the slab [formula]. The endpoints of the arcs lie at the points [formula] on the lower face of the slab and [formula] on the upper face. Given a tangle from m to n and one from n to p, they are composed by stacking their slabs atop each other to line up the n free ends from each tangle and then reparametrizing the height of the slab to

[formula]

Inductive Proofs

Since Tang is a tensor category with a known set of generators, any tangle can be constructed starting with generators and applying compositions and tensor products. Accordingly, statements about tangles can be proven by an inductive technique. While this is just a special case of induction on a construction, it is useful to state it explicitly here.

Given a predicate P on tangles, if the following are true

P is true for id1∈ hom Tang(1,1)

P is true for [formula]

P is true for [formula]

P is true for X+

P is true for X+

If P is true for tangles T1∈ hom Tang(m,n) and T2∈ hom Tang(n,p) then it is true for [formula]

If P is true for any two tangles T1 and T2, then it is true for [formula]

then P is true for all tangles. In particular, it is true for all knots and links.

As an example of the use of this technique, it is possible to reconstruct a well-known theorem on knot groups.

Let T∈ hom Tang(m,n) be a tangle with l loops and let Γ(T)  =  Fm  →  G←Fn. Then the abelianization of G is free on [formula] generators.

Each generating tangle may be easily checked to satisfy the conditions of the theorem.

Let T1∈ hom Tang(m1,n1) and T2∈ hom Tang(m2,n2) with l1 and l2 loops, respectively. Assume Γ(T1)  =  Fm1  →  G1←Fn1 where Ab(G1) is free on [formula] generators, and similarly for Γ(T2). Now

Since [formula], it is free on [formula] generators. Since [formula] with l1 + l2 loops, this satisfies the condition of the theorem.

Let T1∈ hom Tang(m,n) and T2∈ hom Tang(n,p) with l1 and l2 loops, respectively. Assume Γ(T1)  =  Fm  →  G1←Fn where Ab(G1) is free on [formula] generators, and similarly for Γ(T2). Now

Since the abelianization functor preserves pushouts, the abelianization of G1  ×  FnG2 is [formula] modulo n additional relations. Each such relation comes from splicing a free end of T1 to one of T2, identifying a generator of Ab(G1) with one of Ab(G2). However, when a given splicing closes a new loop the other ends have already been identified, so the new relation is redundant. Thus if l new loops are introduced only n - l generators are killed. Counting up, Ab(G1  ×  FnG2) is thus free on generators. Since [formula] and has l1 + l2 + 1 loops - l1 + l2from T1 and T2 and l created in the composition - this satisfies the condition of the theorem.

Thus, since the theorem holds for the generating tangles and for the two rules of composition, it holds for all tangles.

Now, if T is a link there is the special case

The abelianization of the group of an n-component link L is free on n generators.

This sort of technique may provide inductive algorithms for calculation not only of Γ, but of other generalized invariants related to the knot complement. For instance, if the A-Polynomial [\cite=MR1288467] can be suitably generalized, it would immediately come with an inductive algorithm for its calculation.

Skein Theory

The notion of a skein theory for an invariant of links was introduced by Conway [\cite=MR0258014], but the term has as yet no good definition beyond "I know it when I see it" [\cite=SCOTUS378US184]. Roughly it is used to localize information about the invariant; changing this part of a link this way changes the value of the invariant that way. As such, most topologists would agree that Γ is inherently a global notion and cannot be so localized. Indeed the definition seems inherently global, but the Gauss integral also seems inherently global and yet there is a well-known skein theory defining the linking number [\cite=MR0515288].

To probe this further, what is needed is a

A skein theory for for an invariant F:Tang  →  C is a finitely-generated tensor ideal I of Tang such that F factors through the canonical projection to Tang / I.

Evidently a skein theory is not uniquely defined for an invariant of tangles since the projection onto Tang / I itself factors through the quotient of Tang by any smaller ideal. If :Tang / I  →  C is faithful, however, I is evidently maximal. When considering functors generalized from link invariants it is convenient to require only that the restriction of [formula] to the images of knots and links in Tang / I be injective.

There is no skein theory for Γ. That is: there is no finitely-generated tensor ideal I of Tang so that Γ factors through Tang / I, and also [formula] is injective.

Unfortunately there is as yet no proof of this assertion, though it seems to be widely believed. Γ is known to be a perfect invariant for knots, but not for links [\cite=MR0515288]. For example, the two tangles in Figure [\ref=fig:kernGamma] can be calculated to have the same value of Γ. Is there a finite collection of relations which implies this equality for all values of n and which does not imply unwanted relations? The intuition is against it, but it is admittedly unknown. At least now the question can be stated sensibly and a proper attack may be made.
