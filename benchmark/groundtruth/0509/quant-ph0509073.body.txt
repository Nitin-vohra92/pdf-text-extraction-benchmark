Quantitative conditions do not guarantee the validity of the adiabatic approximation

The adiabatic theorem[\cite=Ehrenfest] [\cite=Born] [\cite=Schwinger] [\cite=Kato] is one of the basic results in quantum theory. It has been widely applied in both theories and experiments[\cite=Landau] [\cite=Zener] [\cite=Gell] [\cite=Berry] [\cite=Farhi] and has grown in importance in the recent years due to a number of extensions and applications[\cite=Avron] [\cite=Ali] [\cite=Erik] [\cite=Lidar] [\cite=Roland] [\cite=Andris] [\cite=Sun] [\cite=Tong]. The validity of the application of the theorem had never been doubted until Marzlin and Sanders recently claimed that the application of adiabatic theorem may lead to an inconsistency[\cite=Marzlin]. Essentially they demonstrated that the application of the adiabatic theorem implied a non-unit norm in the states. There have been some attempts at addressing this problem. For instance some authors[\cite=Pati] proposed revolving the inconsistency by dropping some nondiagonal terms in the transition amplitudes; but in doing so, ended up with another inconsistency. Yet, others[\cite=Sarandy] [\cite=Wu] [\cite=Tong6] have suggested that the inconsistency does not arise from the adiabatic theorem itself, but is a result of incorrect manipulations in mathematics. However, we now find that the inconsistency may exist in the use of the adiabatic approximation. It is actually a reflection of a more crucial issue that the quantitative adiabatic conditions are insufficient. In this letter, we show that the widely used quantitative statements of the adiabatic conditions in the adiabatic theorem, which are often deemed as sufficient, are really insufficient. They cannot sufficiently guarantee the validity of the adiabatic approximation.

Before proceeding further, it is instructive to recapitulate the statement of the adiabatic theorem. The theorem states that if a quantum system with a time-dependent nondegenerate Hamiltonian H(t) is initially in n-th eigenstate of H(0), and if H(t) evolves slowly enough, then the state of the system at time t will remain in the n-th instantaneous eigenstate of H(t) up to a multiplicative phase factor. In the literature, the term "H(t) evolves slowly enough", is usually encoded in the quantitative requirement that[\cite=Tong3]

[formula]

or equivalently

[formula]

where Em(t) and |Em(t)〉 are the entirely discrete and nondegenerate instantaneous eigenvalues and eigenstates of H(t), and T is the total evolution time.

We will show that the quantitative adiabatic conditions expressed by Eq. ([\ref=cons]) is not sufficient in guaranteeing the validity of the adiabatic approximation. To this end, we consider two related N-dimensional quantum systems Sa and Sb, which are defined by the Hamiltonians Ha(t) and Hb(t) respectively. The two systems are related through

[formula]

which means that the evolution operator for Sb is the Hermitian conjugate of the evolution operator for Sa.

We first consider the system Sa. The instantaneous eigenvalues and normalized eigenstates of Ha are denoted as Eam(t) and |Eam(t)〉 respectively, which satisfy

[formula]

We assume that Eam(t) are entirely discrete and nondegenerate and they fulfill the adiabatic conditions

[formula]

Now, the state of the system, denoted by |ψa(t)〉, is the solution of the Schrödinger equation

[formula]

with the initial state |ψa(0)〉. If the initial state is in the n-th eigenstate |Ean(0)〉, then the state at time t, |ψa(t)〉, can be expressed exactly as

[formula]

where the unitary operator [formula]. In the application of the adiabatic theorem, we have

[formula]

where the state |ψaadi(t)〉 is given as

[formula]

with the phase αan(t) taking the form

[formula]

Noticing that |〈ψaadi(t)|ψa(t)〉| = |〈Ean(t)|Ua(t)|Ean(0)〉|, one concludes that the approximation ([\ref=psita]) is acceptable if and only if

[formula]

Next we consider the second quantum system Sb, defined by the Hamiltonian Hb(t). We enumerate its instantaneous eigenvalues Ebm(t) and normalized eigenstates |Ebm(t)〉 through

[formula]

For system Sb, the state |ψb(t)〉 is governed by the Schrödinger equation

[formula]

with the initial state |ψb(0)〉. If the system is initially in the n-th eigenstate |Ebn(0)〉, |ψb(t)〉 can be expressed exactly as

[formula]

where [formula].

Under relation ([\ref=hbaa]), it is easy to see that there is a one-to-one corresponding between the eigenvalues and eigenstates of the two systems:

[formula]

From this correspondence, we note that which implies

[formula]

Eq. ([\ref=cons2]) shows that the system Sb satisfies the adiabatic conditions if and only if Sa satisfies them. We may now apply the adiabatic theorem to |ψb(t)〉, so that

[formula]

where the state |ψbadi(t)〉 is given as

[formula]

with αbn(t) taking the form

[formula]

We now calculate the fidelity |〈ψbadi(t)|ψb(t)〉|. From Eqs. ([\ref=hbaa]) and ([\ref=kebnt]), we obtain the relations Ub(t) = Ua†(t) and |Ebn(0)〉 = |Ean(0)〉, and in using these relations we get

[formula]

Eq. ([\ref=nin2]) shows that the approximation ([\ref=psib2]) is acceptable if and only if

[formula]

Comparing Eqs. ([\ref=bbb]) and ([\ref=aaa]), one finds that the two expressions are quite different in general. They may not hold at the same time except for some special cases, which means that the two approximate equations ([\ref=psita]) and ([\ref=psib2]) may not be always valid. Thus, for a given quantum system Sa, one can always construct another quantum system Sb, with both of them fulfilling the same adiabatic conditions. The fact that Ein(t) and |Ein(t)〉 ~ (i = a,b) do satisfy the conditions ([\ref=cons2]) but |ψa(t)〉 or |ψb(t)〉 may not approximate to |ψaadi(t)〉 or |ψbadi(t)〉 indicates that the adiabatic conditions ([\ref=cons]) do not sufficiently guarantee the validity of the adiabatic approximation. Our analysis clearly suggests that the adiabatic conditions described by Eq. ([\ref=cons]) is insufficient.

Further to substantiate the result obtained above, we now furnish an example to illustrate the fact that the approximation |ψb(t)〉  ≈  |ψbadi(t)〉 is invalid while |ψa(t)〉  ≈  |ψaadi(t)〉 is valid. To this end, consider the well-known model, a spin-half particle in a rotating magnetic field. We denote the system as Sa. The Hamiltonian of the system is

[formula]

where ω0 is a time-independent parameter defined by the magnetic moment of the spin and the intensity of external magnetic field, ω is the rotating frequency of the magnetic field and σi, ~ i = x,y,z, are Pauli matrices. The instantaneous eigenvalues and eigenstates of Ha(t) are

[formula]

[formula]

From Ha(t), we may construct another quantum system Sb defined by the Hamiltonian Hb(t) =  - Ua†(t)Ha(t)Ua(t). The eigenvalues and eigenstates of Hb(t) are

[formula]

[formula]

It is easy to show that the adiabatic conditions ([\ref=cons2]) are satisfied as long as ω0  ≫  ω sin θ.

Suppose that the system Sb is initially in the state |Eb1(0)〉. we now calculate |ψb(t)〉 defined by Eq. ([\ref=psibn]) and |ψbadi(t)〉 defined by Eq. ([\ref=psib2]). To this end, we first need to evaluate the unitary operator Ua(t), and we obtain where [formula]. With Ua(t) found, we obtain the exact state |ψb(t)〉 of the state and the approximate state |ψbadi(t)〉 as implied by the adiabatic theorem: We see that |ψb(t)〉 is quite different from |ψbadi(t)〉. The fidelity between them is

[formula]

which shows that |ψb(t)〉 cannot approximate to |ψbadi(t)〉 although ω0  ≫  ω sin θ is fulfilled. However, for this model the approximation ([\ref=psita]) is valid[\cite=Tong]. This example illustrates the fact that fulfillment of the adiabatic conditions ([\ref=cons]) does not sufficiently guarantee the validity of the adiabatic approximation. Another solvable example can be found in [\cite=Marzlin].

It is worth noting that there are alternative expressions for the adiabatic conditions in the literature. One may wonder whether other quantitative expressions of the conditions are sufficient. Here, we will examine two commonly used ones.

One version[\cite=Lidar] expresses the adiabatic conditions as

[formula]

where max |f(t)| (min |f(t)|) means the maximum (minimum) value of |f(t)|, ~ t∈[0,T]. In the use of Eqs. ([\ref=ebnt]) and ([\ref=EE]), one may immediately infer that Eq. ([\ref=cons7]) is satisfied by Sb if and only if it is satisfied by Sa. This in turn will lead to the same result as expressed in Eqs. ([\ref=bbb]) and ([\ref=aaa]), which means that the present conditions are insufficient too.

Another commonly used version[\cite=Roland] of the adiabatic theorem states if

[formula]

then

[formula]

Similarly, we note that the conditions ([\ref=cons8]) cannot guarantee the validity of Eq. ([\ref=resu]). In fact, using Eqs. ([\ref=ebnt]) and ([\ref=EE]), one finds that Eq. ([\ref=cons8]) is satisfied by Sb if and only if it is satisfied by Sa. We then again arrive at Eqs. ([\ref=bbb]) and ([\ref=aaa]). To further elaborate on this, we can use the previous example to illustrate the point. For the Hamiltonian Hb(t) in that example, the left side of Eq. ([\ref=cons8]) is equal to ω sin θ  /  ω0, which may be very small, but the left side of Eq. ([\ref=resu]) is
