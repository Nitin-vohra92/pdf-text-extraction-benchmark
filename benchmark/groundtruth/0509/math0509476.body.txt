Introduction

For the simple groups L2(2f) W. Feit given a characterization using the centralizer of any involution in its Sylow 2-subgroups (see [\cite=F]). In this paper, we characterize L2(2f) using the number of even degree character zeros. For an irreducible character χ of a finite group G, set v(χ) = {g∈G  |    χ(g) = 0}. Clearly, v(χ) is a union of some conjugacy classes of G. An old theorem of Burnside asserts that v(χ) is not empty for any nonlinear χ∈Irr(G). It makes sense to consider the structure of a finite group provided that the number of character zeros in its character table is small (see [\cite=BK], [\cite=Q] for a few examples). Y. Berkovich and L. Kazarin [\cite=BK] posed the following question:

Study the nonsolvable groups with the following "property (*): every irreducible character of even degree has just one zero, i.e., vanishes on just one conjugacy class". Is it true that L2(2f) are the only simple groups with this property?

Our observation is as follows.

Theorem A   L2(2f) (f  ≥  2) are the only nonsolvable groups with the property (*).

In deed, we establish the following two theorems.

Theorem B   Let G be a finite group. Then G satisfies the property (*) if and only if G is one of the following groups:

(1) G possesses a normal and Abelian Sylow 2-subgroup;

(2) G is a Frobenius group with a complement of order 2;

(3) [formula];

(4) [formula].

Theorem C   A finite nonsolvable group G has the following "property (**): every nonlinear χ∈Irr(G) of even degree has at most two zeros" if and only if [formula] or L2(2f)  ×  Z where f  ≥  2 and |Z| = 1,2.

In this paper, G always denotes a finite group. For a subset A of G, let kG(A) be the minimal integer l such that A is a subset of a union of l conjugacy classes of G. For [formula], we put Irr(G|N) = Irr(G) - Irr(G / N); and for λ∈Irr(N), the inertia subgroup of λ in G is denoted by IG(λ).

Let Irr2(G) be the set of irreducible characters of G with even degree.

We shall freely use the following facts: Let [formula] and set [formula].

(1) For any x∈G, [formula] is a union of some classes of G; furthermore, [formula] if and only if χ(x) = 0 for any χ∈Irr(G|N).

(2) If G has the property (*) or (**), then so has G / N.

Theorem C

Let N < M be two normal subgroups of G with kG(M - N) = 1. Then M is solvable.

Proof  Clearly, M / N is an Abelian chief factor of G; also, all elements in M - N have the same order pd, a power of some prime p. For x∈M - N, since M / N - N / N is also a G / N-class, we see that |CG / N(xN)| = |CG(x)|. This implies that for every χ∈Irr(G|N), χ(x) = 0, and so that p divides χ(1) because o(x) = pd (see [\cite=QSY]. By [\cite=IK]N is solvable, and so is M.

For any nonlinear χ∈Irr(G), we have:

(1) If G is nonsolvable and kG(v(χ))  ≤  2, then χG' is irreducible, and

(2) if v(χ)  ⊂  N for some [formula], then gcd(χ(1),|G / N|) = 1.

Proof  (1)   Suppose that χG' is reducible. Then χ  =  ψG, where ψ∈Irr(M) and G'  ≤  M < G. This implies that χ vanishes on G - M, and thus kG(G - M)  ≤  2. By [\cite=QSY] G is solvable, a contradiction.

(2)   If v(χ)  ⊂  N, arguing as in the proof of [\cite=I] we conclude that |χ(x)| = 1 whenever x∈G - N. It follows from [\cite=QSY] that [formula] for any prime divisor p of |G / N|. Therefore gcd(χ(1),|G / N|) = 1.

Let G be a non-Abelian simple group. Then there exists χ∈Irr2(G) such that χ is of p-defect zero for some prime divisor p of |G|.

Proof  It suffices to consider the non-Abelian simple group G with no irreducible character of 2-defect zero. By [\cite=W], we may assume G is isomorphic to one of the following groups: An, M12, M22, M24, J2, HS, Suz, Ru, Co1, Co3, or B.

If G is isomorphic to An,n  ≤  8 or one of the above sporadic simple groups, we conclude the result by [\cite=Atlas]. Suppose that [formula]. By [\cite=MSW], there is χ∈Irr(G) such that 2p|χ(1), where p is the maximal prime not exceeding n. Clearly, χ is of p-defect zero since |G|p = p.

Let G be a nonsolvable group with the property (**). Then G has the unique non-Abelian composite factor.

Proof  By induction we may assume that Sol(G), the maximal solvable normal subgroup of G, is trivial. Let N be a nonsolvable minimal normal subgroup of G. If N is not simple, then [formula] where each Ni is a non-Abelian simple group and s  ≥  2. Let θi∈Irr2(Ni) be of p-defect zero (Lemma [\ref=l203]), and set [formula]. Let χ0 be an irreducible constituent of θG, let x1∈N1,x2∈N2 be of order p and y2∈N2 be of a prime order q ([formula]). Clearly θg is of p-defect zero for any g∈G, thus θg(x1) = θg(x1x2) = θg(x1y2) = 0. This implies that χ0(x1) = χ0(x1x2) = χ0(x1y2) = 0. Since x1,x1x2,x1y2 lie in distinct conjugacy classes, we conclude a contradiction. Suppose that N is simple but G / N is nonsolvable. Since Out(N) is solvable, CG(N) is nonsolvable and hence contains a nonsolvable minimal normal subgroup M as Sol(CG(N)) = 1. Set T = M  ×  N. Let ψ∈Irr2(M) be q-defect zero and θ∈Irr(N) be of p-defect zero, where q,p are prime divisors of |M| and N respectively. Let x∈M, y∈N be of order q,p respectively. Then for any irreducible constituent χ of (ψ  ×  θ)G, we see that χ(x) = χ(y) = χ(xy) = 0. Clearly, x,y,xy lie in distinct classes of G, a contradiction.

Proof  Let N be the unique minimal normal subgroup of G. By Lemma [\ref=lnew] N is a non-Abelian simple groups. Also G / N is solvable and CG(N) = 1.

Step 1. N is a simple group of Lie type.

Suppose that [formula] for some n  ≥  8. Let π be the permutation character of N, and δ be the mapping of N into [formula] such that δ(g) is the number of 2-cycles in the standard composition of g. Set

[formula]

By [\cite=H], both λ and ρ are irreducible characters of N. Clearly either λ or ρ is of even degree. Let χ0 be an irreducible constituent of τG, where τ∈{λ,ρ} is of even degree. By Lemma [\ref=l202](1), (χ0)N  =  τ. For even n, set

[formula], [formula], [formula];

[formula].

For odd n, set

[formula], [formula], [formula];

[formula], [formula], [formula].

We see that λ(ai) = 0 = ρ(bi) for any i = 1,2,3. Therefore, either χ0(a1) = χ0(a2) = χ0(a3) = 0 or χ0(b1) = χ0(b2) = χ0(b3) = 0. Observe that a1,a2,a3 (or b1,b2,b3) lie in distinct classes of G. We conclude a contradiction.

Suppose that [formula] or one of the sporadic simple groups. For the case when G > N, then |G / N| = 2. It implies by Lemma [\ref=l202] that for any non-principal θ∈Irr(N), θ is extendible to χ∈Irr(G), and that [formula] whenever θ(1) is even. By [\cite=Atlas], we conclude a contradiction. For the case when G = N, we also conclude a contradiction by [\cite=Atlas].

Note that [formula], [formula]. By the classification theorem, N must be a simple group of Lie type.

Step 2. If G = L2(q) for some odd q = pf > 5, then [formula].

Since N is one of the simple groups of Lie type, by [\cite=W] N has an irreducible character χ0 of 2-defect zero. Let σ be an irreducible constituent of χG0. Observe that χg0(x) = 0 for any g∈G and any x∈N of even order. It follows that σ(x) = 0 whenever x∈N is of even order. Let P∈Syl2(N), and [formula].

We claim that if G = L2(q) for some odd q = pf > 5, then [formula]. If [formula] where σ∈Irr(G) is of 2-defect zero, then set η∈Irr(G) with degree pf + 1. Let C be a single cycle of G, and [formula]. Clearly, for any v∈Ξ, either σ(v) or η(v) = 0. This implies that kG(Ξ)  ≤  4. Since kG(Ξ) = (q - 1) / 4 (see [\cite=H]), we have that q = 7,9,11,13. By [\cite=Atlas], we conclude that q = 7 and [formula].

Step 3. If P is non-Abelian, then [formula].

In this case, we have v(σ) = Δ  ⊂  N and kG(v(σ)) = 2. By Lemma [\ref=l202], |G / N| is odd and σN  =  χ0. Therefore σ is of 2-defect zero, and σ(x) = 0 for any x∈G of even order. This implies that P∈Syl2(G) and CG(t) is a 2-group for any involution t. By [\cite=S] and P is non-Abelian, G is one of the following groups: Sz(q),q = 22m + 1, L2(q) where q is a Fermat prime or Mersenne prime, L3(4), L2(9) or M10.

By [\cite=Atlas] M10 and L3(4) do not have the property (**). Note that all elements of order 4 in Sz(22m + 1) forms two conjugacy classes , which can be easily verified by [\cite=HB]. Therefore [formula] is not the case. Now by step 2, we conclude that [formula].

Step 4. If P is Abelian, then [formula].

Since P is Abelain, by [\cite=HB], N is one of the following groups: L2(2f), L2(q) where q = 3,5(mod    8) or 2G2(q) where q = 32m + 1. Recall that σ(x) = 0 whenever x∈N is of even order.

Suppose that [formula]. Then all elements of even order in N lie in at least three classes of G (see [\cite=HB]), a contradiction.

Therefore [formula]. Then Aut(N) = N〈φ,δ〉, where 〈φ〉 is the group of field automorphisms of N, 〈δ〉 is the group of diagonal automorphisms of N. Note that φ and δ commute modulo Inn(N), and that if q is even then 〈δ〉 is trivial.

Suppose that N = L2(q) where q > 5,q = 3,5(mod    8). Let [formula] and θ∈Irr(N) of degree q - 1. Arguing as the proof of [\cite=LW], we conclude that θ is extendible to ψ∈Irr(I) and that ψG is irreducible. It follows by Lemma [\ref=l202] that G = I. In particular, G = N or G = N〈δ〉. For the case when G = N, step 2 already yields a contradiction. Suppose that [formula]. Let θ,θ1∈Irr(N) with degree q - 1, q + 1 respectively. By Lemma [\ref=l202], θ,θ1 are extendible to μ and μ1∈Irr(G) respectively, and [formula]. Observe that either (q - 1) / 2 or (q + 1) / 2 is equal to 2k for some k > 1, and that μ(a) = μ1(b) = 0 whenever a,b∈N with 2o(a)|(q - 1),2o(b)|(q + 1). It follows that either [formula] or [formula] is greater than 1, a contradiction.

Therefore [formula]. Suppose that G > N. Then [formula]. For θ∈Irr(N) with degree 2f - 1, θ is φ-invariant and hence induces to an irreducible character of G. This implies by Lemma [\ref=l202] that G / N is a cyclic group of odd order. Recall that χ0∈Irr(N) is of degree 2f, and σ is an extension of χ0 to G. Note that since [formula] is a class of N, it forces Δ to be also a class of G. This implies that |CG(t)| = |G / N||P| for t∈P - {1}, and so that CG(t) = PA, where [formula], [formula]. Observe that σ(g) = 0 whenever g∈G is of even order. It follows that |G / N| is a odd prime q and that Θ, the set of elements of order 2q, forms a class of G. Let w∈A be an element of order q, and y = wt. Since Θ is a class of G, all subgroup of order 2q are conjugate. Therefore, |Θ| = |G:NG(〈y〉)|(q - 1). It is easy to see that [formula]. Then

[formula]

a contradiction.

Let [formula] and H / N be a Hall π-subgroup of G / N. If η∈Irr(H) induces to an irreducible character χ of G, then χ(x) = 0 for any π'-element x∈G - N.

Proof  It follows directly from the definition of induced character.

Suppose that H is a subgroup of [formula]. Let P1∈Syl2(H), P∈Syl2(G) be such that P1  ≤  P. Then, we have

(1) If |P:P1| = 2, then H = P1.

(2) If P = P1, then P  ≤  H  ≤  NG(P).

Proof  It is enough to investigate the maximal subgroups of L2(2f) (see [\cite=H]).

Proof of Theorem C   It suffices to prove that if G is a nonsolvable group with the property (**), then [formula] or L2(2f)  ×  Z where f  ≥  2 and |Z|  ≤  2.

Let [formula] be maximal such that G / N is nonsolvable. By Lemma [\ref=lnew] and Proposition [\ref=p201], N is solvable and [formula] or L2(7). Set [formula], and [formula] be of degree 2f. Let P > N be such that [formula], and let [formula]. Note that for any f  ≥  2, if L2(2f) has nontrivial Schur multiplier, then f = 2.

We first claim that if [formula] then N = 1. If else, to see a contradiction we may assume that N is minimal normal. Observe that Δ  ⊆  v(σ) and [formula]. It follows that kG(Δ) = 2, and that CG(t) is a 2-group, [formula] for any t∈Δ. In particular, there is t0∈Δ such that |CG(t0)| = 4. This implies that a Sylow 2-subgroup of G possesses a cyclic subgroup of index 2 (see [\cite=QSY]). Thus a Sylow 2-subgroup of N is cyclic, and so either |N| = 2 or |N| = qr for some odd prime q. If |N| = 2, then [formula], which is clear not the case. If |N| = qr is odd, then P is a Frobenius group with a complement [formula], which is also impossible.

We claim that if [formula] and G' < G, then [formula] and [formula] where |Z| = 2. It is easy to see that [formula] where |Z| = 2. If [formula], to see a contradiction we may assume K is minimal normal. Note that P / K = P1 / K  ×  Z / K is elementary Abelian and of order 2f + 1. Since 2 = kG / K(Δ)  ≤  kG(Δ)  ≤  kG(v(σ))  ≤  2, we conclude that for any t∈P1 - K  ⊂  P - N, |CG(t)| = |CG / K(tK)| = 2f + 1. Now for any μ∈Irr(G|K), since μ vanishes on Δ, we see that 2|μ(1) (see [\cite=QSY]), and so

[formula]

If N is of odd order, then P1 acts Frobeniusly on N, which is clearly impossible. Suppose that N is an 2-group. Let non-principal λ∈Irr(K) be such that λ is P-invariant, and μ be some irreducible constituent of λG. If IG(λ) = G, then K  ≤  Z(G), and so G = L2(2f)  ×  K or [formula] (|Z1| = 2), which is impossible. If IG(λ) < G, then P  ≤  IG(λ)  ≤  NG(P), and then μ(x) = 0 whenever o(x)|2f + 1 (see Lemma [\ref=l204]), which contradicts the claim: v(μ) = Δ.

In what follows, we need only to show that N = 1 provided that [formula] and G = G'. If else, to see a contradiction we may assume that N is minimal normal, and so is an elementary Abelian q-group for some prime q.

For any non-principal λ∈Irr(N), if λ is G-invariant, then N = Z(G), and since G = G' we conclude that N is a subgroup of the Schur multiplier of L2(2f), and so that [formula]. By [\cite=Atlas], SL(2,5) does not satisfy the property (**), a contradiction. Therefore, IG(λ) < G for any non-principal λ∈Irr(N). Using the same argument as in above, we also conclude that |N| > 2.

Let P < H < G be such that [formula]. We claim that "there is λ0∈Irr(N) such that IG(λ0)  ≤  H, and λG0 has an irreducible constituent χ0 of even degree".

Case a. q = 2, i.e., N is a 2-group.

Since Δ  ⊆  v(σ), kG(Δ) = 1,2. Note that CG(x) is a 2-group and that |CG(x)|  ≤  2f + 1 since kG(Δ)  ≤  2. This implies that for any x∈P - N,

[formula]

and so |CP(x)| = 2f or 2f + 1, |N:P'| = 1,2.

Suppose that N = P' and let P-invariant non-principal λ0∈Irr(N). By Lemma [\ref=l205], we see that P  ≤  IG(λ0)  ≤  H, also that λG0 has an irreducible constituent of even degree.

Suppose that |N:P'| = 2. By the above inequality, we conclude that any nonlinear irreducible character of P must vanish on P - N. Note that since |N| > 2, P' > 1. Let P' / E1 be a principal factor of P and let [formula] be maximal such that P / E is non-Abelian. Let V / E = Z(N / E) and let η0 be a nonlinear irreducible character of P / E. Since P - N  ⊆  v(η0) = P - V, V  ≤  N. Observe that V / E is cyclic by [\cite=I] but V  ≤  N is elementary Abelian, it follows that V / E has order 2, and so that V = N or P'. If V = N, then (η0)N  =  η0(1)λ0. Thus λ0 is P-invariant, and this λ0 works for our claim. If V = P', then (η0)P' = 2dγ, where 22d = 2f + 1. Since η0 vanishes on P - P', it is easy to check that ηN = 2d - 1(λ0  +  λ1), where λ0, λ1 are distinct linear characters of N. Therefore |P:IP(λ0)| = 2. Note that |P / N|  ≥  8 since f + 1 = 2d. Now by Lemma [\ref=l205], we see that such λ0 also works for the claim.

Case b. q > 2, i.e., N is of odd order.

In this case, since P / N is elementary Abelian, it is easy to conclude that there is non-principal λ0∈Irr(N) such that |P:IP(λ0)| = 2. Thus, if 2f  ≥  8, then such λ0 works for our claim by Lemma [\ref=l205].

For the case when 2f = 4, we also conclude that 2 divides |G:IG(λ0)| since [formula] is a T.I subgroup of [formula]. Now if the claim fails, then [formula] or S3. Set [formula], where [formula] are distinct. Observe that ei  =  θi(1) divides |K / N|, that [formula], and that if [formula] then [formula] by [\cite=I]. It follows that [formula]. Therefore, there is ω∈Irr(O2(K)) such that ωG is irreducible. Now by Lemma [\ref=l204], it is easy to see that kG(v(ωG))  ≥  3, a contradiction. This complete the proof of the claim.

Let λ0,χ0 be as in the claim. Then χ0  =  ωG for some ω∈Irr(H). Let Ξ be the set of elements outside N of order divisible by 2f + 1. By Lemma [\ref=l204], Ξ  ⊆  v(χ) and hence kG(Ξ)  ≤  2. Note that [formula]. This implies that f = 2, [formula].

Let us investigate IG(λ0)  ≤  H. We see that either IG(λ0) / N is a 2-group, 3-group, or [formula].

Suppose that IG(λ0) / N is a 2-group or a 3-group. By Lemma [\ref=l204], we can easily conclude a contradiction.

Suppose that IG(λ0) = H. Since λG0 has an irreducible constituent χ0 of even degree, we see that λP0 has an irreducible constituent of even degree. This implies that λP0 = 2ψ where ψ∈Irr(P) is of degree 2. Let ψ1 be any irreducible constituent of (χ0)P and let λ1 be an irreducible constituent of (ψ1)N. Clearly, λ1  =  λg0 for some g∈G. Note that IG(λ1) = Hg, and that either P  ≤  Hg or [formula] since [formula] is a T.I set of [formula]. It follows that either λ1  =  λ or IP(λ1) = N. Therefore, ψ1 always vanishes on P - N. This implies that χ0 vanishes on [formula], which contradicts the property (**). This completes the proof of Theorem C.

Theorem A and Theorem B

Proof of Theorem A   It is a direct consequence of Theorem C.

Proof of Theorem B   It is obvious that all the groups listed in Theorem B have the property (*). Note that if Irr2(G) is empty, then G possesses an Abelian and normal Sylow 2-subgroup. Now we need only to show that if G is a solvable group with the property (*) and [formula], then either G is a Frobenius group with a complement of order 2, or [formula].

Suppose first that there is some χ∈Irr2(G) such that χG' is reducible. Then χ  =  λG for some λ∈Irr(H), where G'  ≤  H < G. This implies that χ vanishes on G - H, and so kG(G - H) = 1. It is easy to conclude in this case that G is a Frobenius group with a complement of order 2.

Now it suffices to prove that [formula] provided that χG' is irreducible for any χ∈Irr2(G). Observe that for any χ∈Irr2(G), [formula] can not be empty, and it follows by Lemma [\ref=l202] that gcd(χ(1),|G / G'|) = 1. In particular, |G / G'| is odd.

Let [formula] maximal be such that G / E is non-Abelian. By [\cite=I] G / E is a p-group or a Frobenius group. If G / E is a p-group and let nonlinear ψ∈Irr(G / E), since gcd(χ(1),p) = 1 for any χ∈Irr2(G), we get that χψ∈Irr2(G), which is impossible because gcd((χψ)(1),p) > 1. Therefore G / E is a Frobenius group with a kernel N / E and a cyclic complement, and thus gcd(χ(1),|G / N|) = 1 whenever χ∈Irr2(G). Clearly, for any τ∈Irr2(N), τ is extendible to some χ∈Irr2(G), and thus [\cite=I] implies that both χ and τ vanish on N - E, so kG(N - E) = 1. Observe that kG / E(N / E - E / E) = 1. It follows that |N / E| = 1 + |G / N|. Since |G / N| is odd, we see that N / E is a 2-group. Set |N / E| = 2r and we have [formula] for any t∈N - E. This implies that: "for any η∈Irr(N|E), η must vanishes on N - E , so 2|η(1) ([\cite=QSY]), and hence η is extendible to G".

Clearly we may assume that E > 1 and set E / F be a principal factor of G. If E / F is not a 2-group, then the above fact implies that N / F is a Frobenius group with the kernel E / F, and then N / E is of order 2 which is impossible. Thus E / F is a 2-group. Let us investigate the quotient group G / F. Let [formula] be a Hall 2'-subgroup of G / F. We see that K acts non-trivially on N / F and fixes every nonlinear irreducible character of N / F. By [\cite=MW], we conclude that N' / F = E / F  ≤  Z(G / F). Now [\cite=G] implies that 2r - 1 = |G / N| divides 2e + 1 for some integer e  ≤  r / 2. This yields that 2r = 4, and so [formula].

To finish the proof of Theorem B, it suffices to show that F = 1. If else, towards a contradiction we may assume that F is a minimal normal subgroup of G. Suppose that F is a 2-group. Since |CG(t)| = 4 for any t∈N - E, there is x∈N - E of order |N| / 2  ≥  8 ([\cite=QSY]), which is clearly impossible. Suppose that F is a q-group for some odd prime q and set P∈Syl2(N). Since |CG(t)| = 4 for any t∈N - E, we see that CP(x)  ≤  P' for any [formula]. It follows by [\cite=MW] that P is either cyclic or isomorphic to Q8, which is also impossible. The proof of Theorem B is complete.

By Theorem C, it is not difficult to deduce the following known result ([\cite=BGC]).

Proposition Let G be a finite non-Abelian group in which every irreducible character has at most two classes of zeros. Then G is one of the following groups:

(1) G is Frobenius group with a complement of order 2 or 3;

(2) G / Z(G) is a Frobenius group with a complement of order 2, and |Z(G)| = 2;

(3) [formula];

(4) [formula] or L2(7).
