Tachyons on Dp-branes from Abelian Higgs sphalerons

Introduction and Summary

Tachyonic modes are of great interest in string theory. They have been found to exist on D-brane-anti-D-brane pairs [\cite=green] or non-BPS D-branes [\cite=nonBPS] and are related to open strings ending on these D-branes. Sen conjectured that at the minimum of the tachyon potential, the negative contribution to the energy density from the tachyon potential should exactly cancel the positive contribution from the tension of the D-brane-anti-D-brane system [\cite=sen]. Studies in string field theory [\cite=sft] have given good hints that this conjecture is indeed correct [\cite=tachyon_sft]. In open bosonic string field theory [\cite=sz] and open superstring field theory [\cite=bsz] this cancellation works with 99%, respectively 85% accurancy. Consequently, toy models were searched for in which such computations would be easier than in the string field theory models. In [\cite=zwiebach] a lump solution in a φ3-model was studied, while in [\cite=brito] a toy model was presented which provides an instability of Dp-branes induced by the sphaleron of a λφ4 (real) scalar field theory living in a space-time with one compactified spatial dimension. In this model, the Z2 symmetry is broken by a Higgs potential and a non-trivial sphaleron appears at the classical level if the field is considered to be periodic in one of the spatial dimensions. Technically, the treatment of the fluctuations about the sphaleron is simplified by the fact that the fluctuation equation is quasi-exactly solvable (QES) [\cite=turbiner]. That is to say that a finite number of the normal modes about the sphaleron can be computed explicitely. It is then possible to check the correctness of Sen's conjecture by restricting the phase space to the algebraically available eigenmodes associated with the unstable solutions. Applying this procedure, it was shown in [\cite=brito] that the cancellation between the negative energy from the tachyon potential and the brane tension can be nearly satisfied (99%)- even when limiting to two or three algebraic modes only.

It is a natural question to investigate whether a similar result could be obtained by using more elaborated theories, like gauge theories. Sphaleron solutions with a corresponding QES normal mode equation exist in the Abelian Higgs model as well. This model consists of a complex scalar field coupled to electromagnetism in a U(1) gauge-invariant way. The gauge symmetry is then broken by an appropriate Higgs potential and, again, non-trivial sphaleron solutions occur at the classical level if periodicity is imposed with respect to one of the spatial dimensions.

In this paper, we apply the ideas and techniques of [\cite=brito] to the Abelian Higgs model. We show that - even when limiting the phase space to a single direction of instability of the sphaleron - an exact cancellation between the negative energy contribution from the tachyon potential and the brane tension is possible for specific values of the radius of the compactifying circle.

In Section 2, we give the Abelian Higgs model in (p + 2) space-time dimensions. In Section 3, we discuss the normal modes for two different values of the Higgs- to gauge boson mass ratio. In Section 4, we discuss our results for the tachyon potential that we obtain for the two cases considered in Section 3.

The model

Action principle

We consider the Abelian Higgs model in a (p + 2)-dimensional space-time with topology [formula]. The action reads:

[formula]

where (yμ,x)  =  (t,yj,x), [formula] are the world-volume's coordinates of a Dp-brane embedded into a p + 2 dimensional space-time and M, N run over these coordinates. The coordinate x is assumed to be compactified on a circle of length [formula] such that [formula]. The complex scalar field is denoted φ and the generalized Maxwell field AM. The field strength tensor, covariant derivative and potential read, respectively:

[formula]

where e is the gauge coupling constant, v the vacuum expectation value and λ the Higgs self-coupling.

There is a spontaneous symmetry breaking of the U(1) symmetry due to the V(φ) potential which leads to a massive gauge boson with mass MW = ev and a massive Higgs boson [formula].

The ansatz and classical solution

In the following we assume the fields to be static and independent of the brane coordinates yj. We thus choose [\cite=bgkk]:

[formula]

[formula] is a real function and 2q is an integer with q representing the Chern-Simons charge of the solution. In the following, we introduce the dimensionless coordinate [formula] such that [formula]. The classical equation for the field Φ reads :

[formula]

This equation admits periodic solutions which are determined in terms of the Jacobi elliptic function sn(z). The solution reads :

[formula]

where k corresponds to a parameter with 0  ≤  k  ≤  1 that fixes the period of the Jacobi function. sn(z,k) has a period 4K(k), where K(k) is the complete elliptic function of the first kind. Specific limits are given by sn(z,0) = sin(z) (with K(0) = π / 2), sn(z,1) = tanh(z) (with K(1) =   ∞  ). As a consequence, non-trivial solutions of ([\ref=kink]) exist only for [formula]. Due to the periodicity of the function Φ(z), the function φ(z) will be periodic with period L provided

[formula]

and the Chern-Simons charge q of the solution should be of the form q = 1 / 2  +  n if m is odd and q = n if m is even. Note that in [\cite=brito] [formula]. We will see in the following that the restriction to half the period of [\cite=brito] is crucial for the cancellation between the brane tension and the negative energy from the tachyon potential.

It turns out [\cite=bgkk] that the lowest energy configuration (the "sphaleron") corresponds to m = 1, n = 0. The sphaleron solution ([\ref=solution]) represents the energy barrier between vacua of different topological charges. Its energy reads:

[formula]

E0(k) is a monotonically increasing function of k: for k = 0 we have [formula], while for k = 1: E0(1)  =  4 / 3.

Normal modes

In order to determine the tachyon potential, we first have to perform the normal mode analysis of the sphaleron solution given above. In the following, we use the notations of [\cite=bgkk] [\cite=carson] :

[formula]

[formula]

where the functions az, aμ are periodic with respect to z on

[formula]

N = 1

For N = 1 we have a total of 14 + 3p explicit eigenvalues of the quadratic form about the sphaleron. Note that, of course, there are more (non-explicit) eigenvectors but along with [\cite=brito] we will only discuss the algebraically available here. In the following, we will give the possible algebraically available solutions.

ψ(1)-channel [\cite=brito]:

[formula]

ψ(2)-channel [\cite=bgkk]:

[formula]

χ(μ)n(μ)-channel:

[formula]

χ(z)n(z)-channel [\cite=bgkk] :

[formula]

where we have used sn, cn and dn as abbreviation for the Jacobi elliptic functions sn(b(k)z,k), cn(b(k)z,k) and dn(b(k)z,k), respectively. The above given eigenvectors are not normalised. We will introduce a normalisation in the computations below.

Note that not all given normal modes are of interest for our study: since we study the sphaleron solution with q = 1 / 2 (2q odd) here, the functions η1 and η2 have to be anti-periodic on

[formula]

. Not all normal modes given above possess this property. Let us discuss this in more detail:

ψ(1)-channel: Only the modes ψ(1)1 and ψ(1)2 are anti-periodic. ψ(1)1 is a zero-mode and ψ(1)2 a positive mode. So, no negative mode which is anti-periodic appears in this channel. This contrasts with the situation in [\cite=brito] where the solution ψ(1)0 plays a central role since it is the negative mode and periodic as required in [\cite=brito].

ψ(2)- and χ(z)n(z)-channel: Only the modes ψ(2)1, ψ(2)2, ψ(2)3 (and related to that χ(z)1, χ(z)2, χ(z)3) are of interest for us since they are anti-periodic. However, only ψ(2)1 is a negative mode, i.e. a tachyonic mode, and thus the (only) one of interest for us.

N = 2

For N = 2 we have a total of 20 + 5p explicit eigenvalues:

ψ(1)-channel: Since ([\ref=lame1]) is independent on N the eigenvalues and functions are the same for all N.

ψ(2)-channel [\cite=bgkk]:

[formula]

χ(μ)n(μ)-channel:

[formula]

χ(z)n(z)-channel [\cite=bgkk] :

[formula]

Again, only the ψ(2)1 mode (and with that χ(z)1) is of interest for us since it is both tachyonic and anti-periodic.

Tachyon potential

Following the ideas of [\cite=brito], we will now discuss the computation of the tachyon potential. For N = 1 we write the discrete modes as:

[formula]

where we have identified [formula], i = 0,..,5, since the two channels are linked.

For N = 2, we have

[formula]

where -similar to N = 1- we have identified [formula], i = 0,..,9.

In the following η1 will not contribute since none of the normal modes is both anti-periodic and negative. For aμ all modes are positive and are thus also not of interest for us. For η2 (respectively az) only the ξ(2)1 mode will contribute. After substituting the normal mode expansion into ([\ref=expansion]) and integrating out all modes over a period 2K(k) / b(k) we thus obtain the following effective action for the Dp-brane:

[formula]

with Tp representing the tension of the Dp-brane and the effective potential:

[formula]

where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to z. ω21  =   - 2kb(k)2 is the negative mode of the sphaleron, while B(k) depends on k. ν is the normalization of the corresponding eigenvector.

We have used here the normalisation and orthogonality of the eigenfunctions:

[formula]

For tachyon condensation we require - following Sen's conjecture - that the contribution from the tachyon potential exactly cancels the brane tension at the critical point ξ* :

[formula]

Evaluation of the critical value [formula] of ([\ref=potential]) is then straightforward. The string tension Tp, the modulus of the minimal value of the potential [formula] and the values [formula], B(k) are shown as functions of k2 for N = 1 in Fig. [\ref=fig1] and for N = 2 in Fig. [\ref=fig2]. Also shown is the ratio V*eff / Tp  =  |V(ξ*)| / Tp. Remarkably, our results indicate that for k2  ≈  0.64 (N = 1), respectively k2  ≈  0.097 (N = 2) the brane tension is equivalent to the value of the tachyon potential at the minimum, i.e. V*eff / Tp  =  |V(ξ*)| / Tp  =  1. For comparison, we also present the corresponding results for the case of a "pure" scalar studied in [\cite=brito]. The data is shown in Fig.[\ref=fig3]. The figure demonstrates that in the scalar sphaleron case using the mode approximation V*eff / Tp  =  |V(ξ*)| / Tp  =  1 is only satisfied in the limit k2  =  0 (in which case the scalar sphaleron becomes a trivial function since Φ(z)  =  0) and our numerical results agree with those in [\cite=brito]. We notice that the crucial difference between our results and those of [\cite=brito] is that ω(k) decreases (as function of k) in our case, while it increases in [\cite=brito]. It is this difference which allows for the effective potential to become equal to the string tension at some non-trivial value of k. [\cite=brito] suggests his results could be improved by inclusion of two or more further eigenmodes. We could perform a similar analysis here, however, since the exact cancellation works for a finite value of k2, the correctness of Sen's conjecture is shown already by studying only one normal mode about the sphaleron.
