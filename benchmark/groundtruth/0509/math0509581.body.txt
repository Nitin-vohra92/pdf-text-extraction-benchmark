Introduction

Let [formula] be a family of subsets of a universe U, where V is an index set. The intersection graph Ω(F) of F has V as a vertex set, and two distinct vertices x and y are adjacent if and only if [formula]. A k-dimensional box is a Cartesian product [formula] where Ri (for 1  ≤  i  ≤  k) is a closed interval of the form [formula] on the real line. For a graph G, its boxicity is the minimum dimension k, such that there exists a family F of k-dimensional axis-parallel boxes with Ω(F)  =  G. We denote the boxicity of a graph G by box(G). The notion of boxicity was introduced by Roberts [\cite=Roberts] and has since been studied by many authors such as Cozzens [\cite=Coz], Trotter [\cite=Trotter] etc.

The complexity of finding the boxicity of a graph was shown to be NP-hard by Cozzens [\cite=Coz]. This was later improved by Yannakakis [\cite=Yan1] and finally by Kratochvil [\cite=Kratochvil] who showed that deciding whether the boxicity of a graph is at most 2 itself is NP-complete.

Researchers have also tried to generalize or extend the concept of boxicity in various ways. The poset boxicity [\cite=TroWest], the rectangle number [\cite=ChangWest], grid dimension [\cite=Bellantoni], circular dimension [\cite=Feinberg] [\cite=Shearer] and the boxicity of digraphs [\cite=ChangWest1] are some examples. Our Result Outer planar graphs (P), series-parallel graphs (SP) and planar graphs (OP) are three well-studied graph classes. There is a natural hierarchy of proper inclusion relation among these graph classes: OP  ⊂  SP  ⊂  P. This hierarchy looks quite natural as is evidenced by the well-known forbidden minor characterizations of these graph classes: planar graphs are exactly the class of graphs with neither K5 nor K3,3 as a minor; series-parallel graphs are exactly the graphs without a K4 as a minor and outer planar graphs consists of exactly those graphs with neither K4 nor K3,2 as minor. Two of the early results in the boxicity literature concern with the boxicity of planar graphs and outer planar graphs.

(Scheinerman [\cite=Scheiner]).If G is outer planar then box(G) ≤  2.

(Thomassen [\cite=Thoma1]).If G is a planar graph then box (G) ≤  3.

Surprisingly, we haven't seen any attempts in the literature to decide whether the tightest possible upper bound for the boxicity of series-parallel graphs is 2 or 3. Considering the simple inductive definition of series-parallel graphs, (see Definition 1 below), one is tempted to believe that series-parallel graphs have boxicity 2, i.e. they can be represented as an intersection graph of axis-parallel rectangles. Moreover, experimentation with small, easily constructible series-parallel graphs seems to support this initial intuition. In this paper we construct a series-parallel graph whose boxicity equals 3. The series-parallel graph G that we construct is fairly large (contains 157 vertices and 311 edges), 2-connected and edge maximal. In fact it is a 2-tree. The reader may note that any series-parallel graph which contains G as an induced sub-graph also has boxicity 3, and thus there exists an infinite family of series-parallel graphs with boxicity 3.

The class of undirected graphs known as k-trees is defined recursively as follows: A k-tree on (k + 1) vertices consists of a clique on (k + 1) vertices. Given any k-tree Tn on n vertices (n  ≥  k + 1) we construct a k-tree on n + 1 vertices by adjoining a new vertex xn + 1 to Tn, which is made adjacent to each vertex of some k-clique of Tn and non-adjacent to the remaining n - k vertices.

It is well-known that the treewidth of a k-tree equals k (see [\cite=Bodland3] for a brief survey on treewidth). In fact the treewidth of a graph G can be defined as the smallest integer k, such that G is a subgraph of some k-tree. (A graph G with treewidth ≤  k is also known as a partial k-tree). Chandran and Sivadasan [\cite=sunns2] have recently proved the following theorem.

For any graph G, (G)  ≤  (G)  +  2.

They construct a family of graphs such that (G) ≥   treewidth (G)(1 - o(1)), establishing the near-tightness of their result. On the other hand, they conjecture that their upper bound is tight but for an additive factor of 1: In particular they believe that for each k  ≥  1, there exists a k-tree with boxicity k + 1. The case k = 1 is trivial since there are obviously 1-trees (normal trees) whose boxicity equals 2. It is well-known that the class of series-parallel graphs is exactly the class of graphs with treewidth at most 2. That is series-parallel graphs are exactly the partial 2-trees. Thus it is easy to see that every edge maximal series-parallel graph is a 2-tree. The graph we construct in this paper is an edge maximal series-parallel graph and is thus a 2-tree, whose boxicity equals 3. Thus the construction given in this paper settles the conjecture for k = 2.

A connected series-parallel graph is a multigraph that can be constructed from a single vertex by a sequence of applications of the following three operations

Series operation (on an edge (u,v)): Add a new vertex y, new edges (u,y), (y,v) and remove (u,v).

Parallel operation (on an edge e = (u,v)): Add another edge between uv.

Adding a pendant vertex (to a vertex u): Add a new vertex y and a new edge (u,y).

Remark: Though series-parallel graphs are defined to be multigraphs, their boxicity depends only on the underlying simple graphs.

I  =  (V,E) is an interval graph if and only if there exists a function Π that maps each vertex u∈V to a closed interval of the form

[formula]

A d-box representation of G = (V,E) is a function θ that maps each vertex v∈V(G) to a d-dimensional axis parallel box [formula], where Ri, for 1  ≤  i  ≤  d, is a closed interval of the form [formula] on the real line, such that [formula]. Let Πi be the function that maps u∈V(G) to Ri. Note that Πi(u) represents the projection of the box θ(u) on the i-th axis. The reader may also note that Πi is the interval representation of a graph G'  =  (V,E') where E'  ⊇  E. We write [formula]

Boxicity of a graph G is defined as the minimum d such that a d-box representation exists for G, and is denoted by box(G).

A graph G with box(G)  ≤  2 is called a rectangle graph. (This terminology is due to [\cite=Trotter])

A 2-box representation of G will also be called a rectangle representation of G. Since in this paper we are dealing only with 2-box representations, θ will always denote some rectangle representation of G.

A split operation on an edge (a,b) of G is the addition of a new vertex c to V(G) and new edges (a,c) and (b,c) to E(G). We say that vertex c is obtained by splitting (a,b).

Note that the split operation on an edge (a,b) is equivalent to a parallel operation on (a,b) followed by a series operation on the resulting (parallel) edge.

Boxicity of Series-Parallel Graphs

In this section, we construct a series-parallel graph with boxicity   >  2. First we construct four graphs L1 to L4 which will occur as induced subgraphs of the final graph. Each graph Li has a bit larger size and has a bit more complex structure than the previous graphs Lj, j  <  i. As the graphs become more complex, we show that stricter constraints get imposed on their possible rectangle representations. Construction of the graph L1: Start with an edge (a,b), split it to obtain a vertex c, and add a pendant vertex z to c. Thus L1 has 4 vertices and 4 edges.

Let θ be a rectangle representation of L1. Then [formula].

Suppose [formula]. Then [formula] [formula] (since [formula]). Thus [formula] which is a contradiction, since (z,c)∈E(L1).

A family [formula] of subsets of a set T has Helly Property if for every J  ⊆  I the assumption that [formula] for every i,j∈J implies [formula].

It is easy to verify that a family of closed intervals on the real line satisfy Helly property. Now it is not difficult to infer that a family of d-dimensional axis parallel boxes also satisfy Helly property. In particular, we have the following Lemma:

Let G be a triangle with vertices a,b,c. Let θ be a rectangle representation of G. Then [formula].

Construction of the graph L2: Start with an edge (a,b), split it to obtain a new vertex c, split (a,c) to obtain a new vertex x and split (b,c) to obtain a new vertex y. The resulting graph L2 has 5 vertices and 7 edges.

Let θ be a rectangle representation of L2, Then [formula] and [formula].

Suppose [formula]. Then we have [formula] and hence [formula]. But x,a,c induce a triangle in L2 and therefore by Lemma [\ref=Helly], [formula]. On the other hand, [formula] (since (x,b)∉E(L2)) which is a contradiction. Thus we can infer that [formula]. Similarly we can show that [formula].

The following Lemma is intuitive. We prove it formally below.

Let θ  =  (Π1,Π2) be a rectangle representation of a graph G. Then [formula] if and only if at least one of the following two conditions hold

[formula]

[formula]

It is easy to verify that [formula] if and only if [formula]. This holds if and only if [formula], for some [formula], since θ(u)  =  Π1(u)  ×  Π2(u) for any vertex u. But [formula] if and only if [formula], and the Lemma follows.

Let θ  =  (Π1,Π2) be a rectangle representation of a graph G, and let a,b∈V(G) such that [formula]. Let [formula] , [formula],[formula] and [formula]. Now if l'1  =  max(l1(a),l1(b)), l'2 = max(l2(a),l2(b)), r'1  =  min(r1(a),r1(b)) and r'2  =  min(r2(a),r2(b)). Then the corner points of [formula] are defined to be the four points (l'1,l'2),(l'1,r'2),(r'1,l'2),(r'1,r'2).

Intuitively, the corner points are the four corners of [formula]. The four corner points need not be distinct.

Let θ  =  (Π1,Π2) be a rectangle representation of L2. If [formula] for i  =  1,2, then θ(c) contains a corner point of [formula].

First note that (a,b)∈E(L2) and therefore [formula] and thus the corner points of [formula] are defined. For i  =  1,2, let li'  =  max(li(a),li(b)) and ri'  =  min(ri(a),ri(b)) represent the left and right end points of [formula] respectively. In L2, vertices a,b,c induce a triangle and hence by Helly property (Lemma [\ref=Helly]) we have [formula]. It follows that for i = 1,2, [formula]. Moreover, by assumption we have for i = 1,2, [formula]. Thus Πi(c) is an interval which contains at least one point from [formula] and at least one point from the complement of [formula]. Therefore we can infer that either li'∈Πi(c) or ri'∈Πi(c). Thus we conclude that θ(c)  =  Π1(c)  ×  Π2(c) contains at least one of the corner points (l1',l2'),(l1',r2'),(r1',l2'),(r1',r2').

Construction of the graph L3: Start with a single edge (a,b), split (a,b) 5 times to obtain the vertices [formula]. For each ci, obtain xi by splitting (a,ci) and yi by splitting (b,ci). Note that for 1  ≤  i  ≤  5, a,b,ci,xi,yi induce a graph isomorphic to L2 in L3.

Let G = (V,E) be a graph with box(G)  ≤  2. Let θ = (Π1,Π2) be a rectangle representation of G. We say that two vertices u,v∈V(G) are a crossing pair with respect to θ if and only if one of the following 2 conditions hold:

Π1(u)  ⊆  Π1(v) and Π2(v)  ⊆  Π2(u) or

Π1(v)  ⊆  Π1(u) and Π2(u)  ⊆  Π2(v).

Let θ = (Π1,Π2) be any rectangle representation of L3. Then a,b cannot be a crossing pair with respect to θ.

Suppose a,b be a crossing pair. Then without loss of generality assume that

[formula]

Now observe that for each i, 1  ≤  i  ≤  5, a,b,ci,xi,yi induce a subgraph isomorphic to L2. Hence by Lemma [\ref=difference], we have

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=projection] inequality (2) implies that at least one of the two conditions (a) [formula] (b) [formula] holds. But by condition (1), Π1(a)  ⊆  Π1(b), and hence [formula]. Thus we infer that

[formula]

In a similar way, from inequality (3) we can infer that

[formula]

From inequalities (4) and (5) we get

[formula]

Therefore by Lemma [\ref=corner], for each i, 1  ≤  i  ≤  5, θ(ci) contains a corner point of [formula]. But since there are only at most 4 corner points, by pegion hole principle there exist i,j where 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  5 and [formula] such that θ(ci) and θ(cj) contain the same corner point, i.e. [formula]. This is a contradiction since [formula].

Construction of the graph L4: The graph L4 is obtained from L3 by splitting the edge (xi,ci) to obtain zi for 1  ≤  i  ≤  5.

Let θ  =  (Π1,Π2) be a rectangle representation of L4. Then there exists [formula] such that either a,c or b,c is a crossing pair.

We claim that there exists a [formula] such that [formula] or [formula]. Suppose not. Then for each ci and for j = 1,2 , [formula]. Thus by Lemma [\ref=corner], for each i, 1  ≤  i  ≤  5, θ(ci) contains a corner point of [formula]. Since there are only at most 4 corner points of [formula], by pegion hole principle, there exist i,j where 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  5 and [formula] such that [formula]. This is a contradiction since [formula]. Therefore without loss of generality we can assume that

[formula]

Now [formula] induce a graph isomorphic to L2 in L4. Therefore by Lemma [\ref=difference], [formula] and [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=projection], the former inequality implies that at least one of the two conditions (a) [formula] (b) [formula] holds. But by condition (7), [formula], and hence [formula]. Thus we infer that

[formula]

Similarly [formula] implies the following:

[formula]

From (8) and (9) we claim that

[formula]

To verify the above, let l' and r' be the left and right endpoints respectively of [formula]. ([formula] since [formula]). Let [formula] and [formula]. (Inequalities (8) and (9) ensure that we can find such an x and y). Since Π2(a) and Π2(b) are intervals it is easy to verify that either x  <  l'  <  r'  <  y or y  <  l'  <  r'  <  x. Without loss of generality let x  <  l'  <  r'  <  y. Then, clearly we have, [formula], as required.

Observe that the graph induced by [formula] in L4 is isomorphic to L1. Hence by Lemma [\ref=pendant], [formula]. Since by (7), [formula] we must have

[formula]

Let l'',r'' be the left and right end points respectively of [formula]. It is easy to see that the set [formula] is the same as the set [formula]. Since Π2(a),Π2(b) and Π2(c1) are intervals, (10) and (11) imply that at least 3 of these points are contained in Π2(c1). Thus either [formula] or [formula]. In other words:

[formula]

By (7) and (12), we conclude that either a,c1 is a crossing pair or b,c1 is a crossing pair.

A Series-Parallel graph whose boxicity >  2.

Using the ideas presented above we present a series-parallel graph whose boxicity >   2. The construction is as follows.

Let the initial graph be the single edge (a,b).

For i  =  15 do: Apply the split operation on (a,b) and let ci be the resulting vertex.

For each ci where 1  ≤  i  ≤  5 do

Apply the split operation on (a,ci) five times: Let dij where 1  ≤  j  ≤  5 be the resulting vertices.

Apply the split operation on (b,ci) five times: Let eij where 1  ≤  j  ≤  5 be the resulting vertices.

For all i,j where 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  5 Apply the split operation on (a,dij), (ci,dij), (b,eij) and (ci,eij). Let the resulting vertices be pij, qij, rij and sij respectively.

Note that the graph G constructed above is a series-parallel graph, since we are using the split operations only. Also note that G has n = 157 vertices and 2n - 3 = 311 edges. Since any series-parallel graph on n vertices with 2n - 3 edges is edge maximal (see chapter 8, Diestel [\cite=Diest]), it follows that G is an edge maximal series-parallel graph. Thus it is also a 2-tree (This fact is in fact evident from the construction since we are using split operations only) and hence 2-connected.

The graph G defined above has boxicity   =  3.

First we show that box(G)  >  2. Suppose not. Then there exists a rectangle representation for G. It is easy to verify that [formula] induce a graph isomorphic to L4. Therefore by Lemma [\ref=main], there exists a [formula] such that either a,c is a crossing pair or b,c is a crossing pair. Without loss of generality let a,c1 be a crossing pair. But [formula], induce a graph isomorphic to L3. Thus by Lemma [\ref=cross], a,c1 cannot be a crossing pair, which is a contradiction. Thus we infer that box(G)  >  2. Since any series-parallel graph is planar we have (by Theorem [\ref=planar]) box(G)  ≤  3 and the theorem follows.

Conclusions and Open Problems

In this paper we have shown that there exists an infinite family of series-parallel graphs with boxicity equal to 3. Thus the following problem arises naturally.

1. Characterize the class of series-parallel graphs with boxicity ≤  2.

It is implicit in a Theorem of Thomassen [\cite=Thoma1] that any series-parallel graph without the join of K2 and [formula] as an induced subgraph has a strict box representation. Another interesting open problem is:

2. Prove that for each k  ≥  1, there exist a k-tree with boxicity = k + 1.

The case k = 1 is trivial, and the case k = 2 is settled in this paper. Also it is not difficult to show that there exist k - trees with boxicity at least [formula].
