[formula] to Subleading Order in the Plasma Density

[formula] and the Coulomb Log

The stopping power of plasma component b for projectile p is of the form

[formula]

where the Coulomb logarithm ln Λb involves a ratio of short- and long-distance length scales. To compute ln Λb, we employ the method of [\cite=BPS]. To introduce this method, we consider the Coulomb potential φν(r) of a point source in ν spatial dimensions: φν(r)  ~  1 / rν - 2. Clearly the long and short distance behavior of φν depends on the spatial dimensionality ν. In high ν, short distance (hard) interactions are accentuated, while in low ν the large distance (soft) physics predominates.

For Coulomb interactions, ν  =  3 is special in that neither hard nor soft processes are dominant. For ν  <  3, the soft physics is predominant, and for ν  >  3 the hard processes are dominant. The energy loss for ν  >  3, [formula], is obtained from the Boltzmann (B) equation, and it contains a pole   (ν - 3)- 1   that reflects an infrared divergence in the scattering process when   ν  →  3+  . The energy loss for ν < 3, [formula], is obtained from the Lenard-Balescu (LB) kinetic equation, and it contains a pole   (3 - ν)- 1   that reflects an ultraviolet divergence when   ν  →  3-  . The stopping power to subleading order is therefore

[formula]

and it is completely finite. Hence the two poles must cancel. The dependence of the residues of the poles on   ν   brings in a logarithm of the ratio of the relevant short- and long-distance length scales, which is precisely the Coulomb logarithm.

Collective Excitations: Lenard-Balescu Equation for [formula]

The soft physics is described to leading order in the plasma density by

[formula]

which is the Lenard-Balescu kinetic equation for plasma species a and b, where

[formula]

with [formula] and [formula]. The collective behavior of the plasma enters through its dielectric function

[formula]

The rate of kinetic energy loss of species a to species b is given by

[formula]

We evaluate this for the case in which species a is a single projectile of mass mp and velocity [formula], [formula] and the distribution function [formula] for plasma species b is Maxwell-Boltzmann at temperature Tb  =  1  /  βb. With dx  =  vpdt,

[formula]

where Mpb = mp + mb is the total mass, [formula], and [formula]. Here Ων is the area of a unit sphere in ν dimensions and K is an arbitrary wave number whose dependence cancels in the limit ([\ref=e1]).

Hard Collisions: Boltzmann Equation for [formula]

Hard collisions in the plasma density are correctly described by the Boltzmann equation, which gives

[formula]

where [formula], and dσpb is the full quantum-mechanical differential cross section for scattering of the projectile (p) from the initial velocity [formula] to the final velocity [formula] off a plasma particle (b). Straightforward kinematical manipulations exploiting the axial symmetry of the scattering produce the form

[formula]

in which [formula] is the total momentum of the center of mass, [formula] is the relative momentum in the center of mass, and [formula] is the momentum transfer.

The classical cross section in ν dimensions is [formula], where B is the classical impact parameter. Some calculation gives

[formula]

with mpb = mpmb / Mpb being the reduced mass. Placing the result ([\ref=dsigma-qsqrd]) in Eq. ([\ref=eeloss]) yields

[formula]

Making the decomposition [formula] expresses [formula], where [formula] is the quantum correction to Eq. ([\ref=288bobsnotes]). The integral [formula] is most easily evaluated by first calculating [formula], where [formula] is the Born approximation to dσpb, and then subtracting the contribution [formula]. Inserting the correction [formula] into Eq. ([\ref=eeloss]) yields

[formula]

where ψ is the logarithmic derivative of the gamma function, Re denotes the real part, [formula] , and [formula].

Results

The total stopping power is the sum of the contributions from large-distance collective excitations [formula] and from short-distance hard collisions [formula], that is, the sum over species b of Eqs. ([\ref=lesssingglessregg]), ([\ref=288bobsnotes]), and ([\ref=dedtqmcalf]). The poles at ν  =  3 and the ln K terms cancel. Our result for dE / dx is generically of the form n  ( ln n  +  C) in the plasma density n, and it is accurate to all orders in the quantum parameter ηb. Figures [\ref=fig:aDT030125Exfig] and [\ref=fig:aDT030125dEdxxeifig] illustrate our result with an example that is relevant to the DT plasmas in laser fusion capsules.
