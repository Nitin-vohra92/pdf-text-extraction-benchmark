Collective dynamics in crystalline polymorphs of ZnCl2: potential modelling and inelastic neutron scattering study

Introduction

Among the metal halides of form MX2 (M: metal, X: halide), ZnCl2 continues to draw attention in current research for several reasons. Firstly, the crystalline ZnCl2 has four structurally determined polymorphs[\cite=breh] [\cite=bryn] at the ambient pressure, viz. α-ZnCl2 (I2d, Z=4], β-ZnCl2 (P21 / n, Z=12), γ-ZnCl2 (P42 / nmc, Z=2), and δ-ZnCl2 (Pna21, Z=4) in which the Zn atom is tetrahedrally coordinated with Cl atoms. Secondly, ZnCl2 displays unique phase transitions upon compression as well as pressure release. For instance, the four-coordinated α-ZnCl2 transforms into a six-coordinated CdCl2-like phase at 2.1 GPa, which further converts into four-coordinated γ-ZnCl2 upon decompression[\cite=saka]. Thirdly, molten ZnCl2, which is commercially used as a solvent and catalyst in the hydro cracking of coal slurries and heavy crude oil fractions[\cite=gard], typifies high viscosity[\cite=mcke] [\cite=grub] [\cite=wood], low ionic diffusivities[\cite=bock], and very low electric conductivity[\cite=duke] due mainly to its non-uniform polymeric network linkage.[\cite=ribe1] Further, liquid ZnCl2 has the ability to supercool into a glass[\cite=smith] at a relatively low glass transition temperature (Tg = 375 K). Finally, ZnCl2 glass, which is intermediate between strong (e.g. SiO2) and fragile (e.g. CKN) glasses, finds its potential use as a low-loss optical transmission medium in the near infrared region.[\cite=bryan]

All the crystalline phases of ZnCl2 at ambient pressure are formed by the network of ZnCl4 tetrahedra sharing their corners. But this network is rather soft (unlike SiO2 or BeF2) resulting in a strongly hybridized character for the normal modes of vibration.[\cite=smith] Further, in the low frequency range (<   20 cm- 1), where the collective acoustic modes are expected to dominate the vibrational density of states, liquid ZnCl2 exhibits a prominent boson peak[\cite=lebon] [\cite=kart] reflecting its more complex microstructure. Ribero et al.[\cite=ribe2] examined the nature of instantaneous normal modes in the atomic motion of liquid ZnCl2, which involve the coupled vibration of several quasi-molecular ZnCl4 units of the network and has the local torsional character. Although molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations have been reported for glassy as well as molten ZnCl2, the need for a realistic interatomic potential has remained unfulfilled.[\cite=yann] The present work is primarily intended to make an attempt in formulating an effective transferable interatomic potential that can be applied to any of the polymorphs of ZnCl2 with equal ease. Angell et al.[\cite=ang1] had already suggested that there is little distinction between the glassy and the crystalline behavior of ZnCl2 so far as the dynamics is concerned. They further opined that the short time dynamics of liquid ZnCl2 near its melting point (Tm = 593 K) might be regarded as solid-like in character. Later on, X-ray diffraction measurements of molten ZnCl2 by Triolo and Narten[\cite=trio] favored this argument strongly. Anomalously low enthalpy and volume changes on fusion are supposed to be behind the resemblance of ZnCl2 melt with the crystalline structure.[\cite=gard] An extensive neutron diffraction study by Desa et al.[\cite=erw] further showed that vitreous ZnCl2 has a distorted closed packed array of Cl atoms in which Zn atoms are randomly distributed in the tetrahedral sites. Numerous such studies undoubtedly imply that if we are able to understand the dynamical properties of crystalline polymorphs of ZnCl2, microscopic interpretation for glassy and molten phases will also be robust. In the present work we have also determined the phonon density of states in the α-phase by coherent inelastic neutron scattering. The potential model calculation is found to be in fair agreement with the neutron data.

Crystal structure

Till 1961, it was commonly believed that the ambient stable phase of ZnCl2 had a layered structure in which each Zn atom was coordinated to six Cl atoms to form regular octahedra with van der Waals bonding between the layers.[\cite=paul] Later investigations proved that ZnCl2 has bonding based on a tetrahedral framework. Initially three solid phases of ZnCl2 were known crystallographically. These were α, β and γ polymorphs of ZnCl2 belonging to monoclinic and tetragonal crystal classes (Table [\ref=tab1]). While α and β phases have cristobalite type three dimensional networks of corner linked tetrahedra[\cite=breh], γ-ZnCl2 crystallizes to a layered structure of cross linking tetrahedra as in case of red HgI2.[\cite=osw] However, in 1978, Brynestad and Yakel[\cite=bryn] [\cite=yak] pointed out that all three modifications are rather the result of water contamination and that purely anhydrous ZnCl2 has an orthorhombic unit cell containing corner linked ZnCl4 tetrahedra. This orthorhombic phase has been referred to as δ-ZnCl2 in various papers.[\cite=saka] [\cite=erw] Fig. [\ref=fig1] suggests that the close packed layers in δ-ZnCl2 are horizontal. Further, temperature has a significant impact[\cite=ang2] on the structure of ZnCl2. While rapid cooling of the melt (or devitrification of the glass) produces the α-phase, slow cooling of the melt favors the formation of β-ZnCl2. On the other hand, concentrated solution yields the γ-phase upon crystallization.

Experiments and data analysis

Experimental studies involving crystalline ZnCl2 encounter difficulties because of its extreme hygroscopicity. The reagent grade chemical ZnCl2 (purity 98%), purchased from Merck Chemical Co. (Germany), was dried for a period of 8 hours. It was then exposed into the glove box under dry argon atmosphere for transferring into different containers. About 30 g of the polycrystalline ZnCl2 sample so obtained was placed in a thin walled aluminum sample holder of circular shape for the inelastic neutron scattering (INS) studies. Another cylindrical vanadium can was made use of for taking the neutron diffraction pattern of the same sample. Neutron powder diffraction confirmed that the sample belongs to the α-phase. The structural refinements of the powder data were carried out using the Rietveld profile refinement method with the program DBWS 9411.[\cite=young] The cell constants and atomic coordinates refined from the data recorded at 300 K are in close agreement with the reported data.[\cite=breh]

Inelastic neutron scattering measurements were carried out at 300 K using a medium resolution triple-axis spectrometer[\cite=chap3] at the Dhruva Reactor, Trombay. The instrument used a monochromated beam of neutrons produced by diffraction from the (111) planes of a copper crystal. Neutrons scattered inelastically by the sample were again diffracted by a pyrolytic graphite (002) analyzer and subsequently detected in a 10BF3 proportional counter. All the measurements were made in the energy loss mode with constant momentum transfer ([formula]). The elastic energy resolution was about 15% of the initial energy. Several scans were performed with the final energy (Ef) values of 30 meV and [formula] values of 5 to 6 Å- 1 that are much larger than the size of the Brillouin zone (about 1 Å- 1). Additional measurements of the neutron background were made by detuning the analyzer crystal from the position by ±  5o and repeating the scan for the same sample.

The neutron weighted phonon density of states, gn(E), are obtained from the measured scattering function S(,E) through the following relation[\cite=price]

[formula]

where n(E,T) = - 1; A, B are normalization constants; 2W(Q) is the Debye-Waller factor; bp, Mp, and gp(E) refer respectively to the neutron scattering length, mass and partial phonon density of states of the pth atom in the unit cell. The quantity within [formula] represents the average over all [formula] values. The factor [formula] turns out to be 0.063 and 0.474 barn/a.m.u. for Zn and Cl atoms respectively.

Model interatomic potential

As previously stated, there is a need to formulate a realistic potential model that can effectively model the structure and dynamics in various polymorphs of ZnCl2. In the present model, Born-Mayer repulsive and attractive van der Waals interactions among different pairs of atoms have been incorporated. Because of the covalent nature of the Zn-Cl bond, a stretching term has to be included further in the potential model. The model thus turns out to be

[formula]

where A (=1822 eV) and B (=12.364) are two constants, used extensively in several previous works.[\cite=chap1] [\cite=mala] [\cite=mittal]; R(k) and R(k') refer to effective radius parameters for Zn and Cl atoms. Ckk' accounts for van der Waals terms between Zn-Zn, Zn-Cl and Cl-Cl atoms; r0 is the equilibrium Zn-Cl bond length; D and n are two adjustable parameters. At the observed lattice constants and atomic positions in the unit cell, the parameters were so adjusted as to give nearly a zero internal stress and net force on each individual atom. Once the structural constraints are met, the potential parameters were further adjusted so that the calculated eigen frequencies are real for all the wave vectors in the entire Brillouin zone. The group theoretical analysis provides the symmetry vectors necessary for block diagonalization of the dynamical matrix. Table [\ref=tab2] lists the final values of the optimized parameters. All the necessary calculations were made using DISPR[\cite=chap2] developed at Trombay. Lattice parameters and atomic coordinates obtained as a result of the potential minimization for various polymorphs of ZnCl2 are displayed in Tables [\ref=tab3a], [\ref=tab3b], [\ref=tab3c] &  [\ref=tab3d]. At high pressures, the equilibrium crystal structures were obtained from the free energy minimization.

Vibrational modes: Raman and infrared active

A group theoretical classification of various zone-center phonon modes for each of the crystalline modifications in ZnCl2 is given in Table [\ref=tab1]. Experimental mode assignments are available for only two polymorphs of ZnCl2 (viz. α-ZnCl2 and γ-ZnCl2). Measured optical phonon data[\cite=saka] [\cite=yann] [\cite=ang2] [\cite=james] are found to be in good agreement with our calculated results (Tables [\ref=tab4a], [\ref=tab4b], [\ref=tab4c] &  [\ref=tab4d]). It may be noted that the lowest frequency mode in the γ-phase (36 cm- 1) is almost half the frequency of that in the α-phase (80 cm- 1). Further the pressure dependence of Raman modes in α, γ and δ forms of ZnCl2 are calculated. Except for the α-phase, in all the others, the calculated pressure dependence compares well with the available measured[\cite=saka] [\cite=pols] data (see Fig. [\ref=fig2]). Since β-ZnCl2 has as many as 108 phonon modes, pressure dependence of these modes is not shown here.

Phonon dispersion relations and phonon density of states in α-ZnCl2

As Table [\ref=tab1] suggests, there is a total of 18 degrees of freedom in α-ZnCl2, giving rise to 18 phonon frequencies. Following are the representations of normal modes along the three high symmetry directions (viz. Σ, Λ and Δ).

Σ(100): 8Σ1 + 10Σ2 Λ(001): 4Λ1 + 4Λ2 + 5Λ3 (Λ3 being doubly degenerate) Δ(110): 9Δ1 + 9Δ2

Fig. [\ref=fig3] displays the calculated phonon dispersion relations in α-ZnCl2. Considerable dispersion and anti-crossing are found for the branch in all the three symmetry directions which indicate strong hybridization. There are no indications of any phonon softening in the calculations in any of the four polymorphs at ambient pressure.

We have plotted the measured phonon density of states along with the calculated spectrum in Fig. [\ref=fig4]. The experimental one-phonon spectra are obtained by subtracting the multiphonon contribution from the experimental data. The multiphonon contribution is obtained using the Sjolander formalism.[\cite=sjol] The experimental data (Fig. [\ref=fig4]) confirm two broad structures with a band gap around 25 meV. The measured neutron data[\cite=gal] for vitreous ZnCl2 and the Raman density of states data[\cite=alio] for molten ZnCl2 are qualitatively similar to the present neutron data on crystalline α-ZnCl2. The computed partial phonon density of states is shown in Fig 5(a). This indicates that the Zn ions contribute significantly at energies below 10 meV while from 10 meV to 19 meV, the vibrations of Cl ions dominate. However, in the higher energy region, contributions from both the ions remain more or less similar. A comparison of the calculated phonon density of states for all the crystalline polymorphs is shown in Fig. 5(b). Two band gaps (a broad one around 23 meV and a very narrow one around 36 meV) are observed in each of the phases, though of slightly varying degree. For these calculations, all the phonon modes are integrated at each wave vector within the irreducible Brillouin zone on a [formula] mesh with an energy resolution of 1.0 meV.

Thermodynamic properties

Heat capacity and Debye temperature

As Fig. [\ref=fig6](a) suggests, there is a fairly good agreement between the calculated and the experimental data[\cite=ang3] on the molar heat capacity. As the inset shows, there is vary small variation among heat capacities of various polymorphs, which reflects the small variation in the respective phonon density of states. In particular, the spike in ΔCp at about 50 K in the inset of Fig. [\ref=fig6](a) arises due to the different phonon density of states of the α-phase at low energy in Fig. [\ref=fig5](b). Fig. [\ref=fig6](b) displays the Debye temperature (θD) plot for different crystalline modifications in ZnCl2. The characteristic Debye temperature in the present model turns out to be 375 K, while the experimental value is 340 K[\cite=ang3].

Mode Grüneisen parameters and thermal expansion

The mode Grüneisen parameters are important indicators of the anharmonicity of phonon modes and their role in determining the thermal expansion. For the ith mode the Grüneisen parameter is given by

[formula]

In the quasiharmonic approximation, the [formula]th phonon mode contributes ([formula])γiCVi to the volume thermal expansion (αV), where CVi denotes the contribution of the ith mode to the volume heat capacity. As heat capacity and bulk modulus values remain similar for each of the polymorphs, it is obviously the mode Grüneisen parameter which dominates in the determination of αV. Fig. [\ref=fig7] displays averaged γi as a function of phonon energy for different crystalline polymorphs in ZnCl2. One may notice that while for α, β and δ phases, 18 meV phonons have maximum variations with volume, γ-ZnCl2 behaves slightly differently. This is further reflected in the subsequent thermal expansion calculation (see Fig. [\ref=fig7]).

Equation of state

The crystal structure parameters as a function of pressure (at T=0 K) are calculated corresponding to the minimum of Gibbs free energy. Fig. [\ref=fig8] shows how the cell dimensions belonging to different crystalline polymorphs of ZnCl2 vary with pressure. It is observed that the compressibility is anisotropic. While [formula] axis is the most compressible in β and γ forms of ZnCl2, it is the least compressible in α-ZnCl2. In δ-ZnCl2, [formula] axis is found to be the most compressible. However, the volume derivative with pressure in all the phases looks a bit alike, as their bulk moduli are similar.

Conclusions

We have developed an interatomic potential model for ZnCl2 that mimicks the vibrational and thermodynamic properties of the polymorphs of crystalline ZnCl2 and reproduces fairly well the inelastic neutron scattering data for the α-phase. The fact that the γ-phase shows differences in Grüneisen parameters and lattice expansion is essentially due to its layered structure, which is very different from other corner-shared polymorphs. This transferable potential model may be exploited further to investigate the properties of the glassy and the liquid phases of ZnCl2.
