Subfactors and Hadamard Matrices

Introduction

A complex Hadamard matrix is a matrix [formula] having all entries of absolute value 1 and all rows mutually orthogonal. Equivalently, [formula] is a unitary matrix with all entries of the same absolute value. For example, the Fourier matrix Fn = (ωij)1  ≤  i,j  ≤  n, [formula], is a Hadamard matrix.

In the recent years, complex Hadamard matrices have found applications in various topics of mathematics and physics, such as quantum information theory, error correcting codes, cyclic n-roots, spectral sets and Fuglede's conjecture. A general classification of real or complex Hadamard matrices is not available. A catalogue of most known complex Hadamard matrices can be found in [\cite=TZ]. The complete classification is known for n  ≤  5 ([\cite=Haagerup]) and for self-adjoint matrices of order 6 ([\cite=BeN]).

The connection between Hadamard matrices and von Neumann algebras arose from an observation of Popa ([\cite=Po2]): a unitary matrix U is of the form [formula], H Hadamard matrix, if and only if the algebra of n  ×  n diagonal matrices Dn is orthogonal onto UDnU*, with respect to the inner product given by the trace on [formula]. Equivalently, the square of inclusions:

[formula]

is a commuting square, in the sense of [\cite=Po1],[\cite=Po2]. Here τ denotes the trace on [formula], normalized such that τ(1) = 1.

Such commuting squares are called spin models, the name coming from statistical mechanical considerations (see [\cite=JS]). By iterating Jones' basic construction, one can construct a hyperfinite, index n subfactor from H (see for instance [\cite=JS]). The subfactor associated to H can be used to capture some of the symmetries of H, and thus to classify H to a certain extent (see [\cite=BHJ],[\cite=Jo2],[\cite=BaN]).

Let N  ⊂  M be an inclusion of II1 factors of finite index, and let [formula] be the tower of factors constructed by iterating Jones' basic construction (see [\cite=Jo1]), where e1,e2,... denote the Jones projections. The standard invariant GN,M is then defined as the trace preserving isomorphism class of the following sequence of commuting squares of inclusions of finite dimensional *  -algebras:

[formula]

The Jones projections e1,e2,...,en are always contained in [formula]. If the index of the subfactor N  ⊂  M is at least 4, they generate the Temperley-Lieb algebra of order n, denoted TLn. In a lot of situations the relative commutant [formula] has some interesting extra structure, besides TLn. For instance, the five non-equivalent real Hadamard matrices of order 16 yield different dimensions for the second relative commutant [formula], and thus are classified by these dimensions ([\cite=BHJ]).

In this paper we investigate the relation between Hadamard matrices and their subfactors. We look at Hadamard matrices of small dimensions or of special types. The paper is organized as follows: in the first section we recall, in our present framework, several results of [\cite=Jo2],[\cite=JS] regarding computations of standard invariants for spin models.

In section 2 we study the subfactors associated to Hadamard matrices of Dita type. These are matrices that arise from a construction of [\cite=Di], which is a generalization of a construction of Haagerup ([\cite=Haagerup]). Most known parametric families of Hadamard matrices are of Dita type. We show that the associated subfactors have intermediate subfactors.

In the last section we present a list of computations of the second and third relative commutants [formula], for complex Hadamard matrices of small dimensions. We make several remarks and conjectures regarding the structure of the standard invariant. Most of the computations included were done using computers, with the help of the Mathematica and GAP softwares.

Subfactors associated to Hadamard matrices

Let H be a complex n  ×  n Hadamard matrix and let [formula]. U is a unitary matrix, with all entries of the same absolute value. One associates to U the square of inclusions:

[formula]

where Dn is the algebra of diagonal n  ×  n matrices and τ is the trace on [formula], normalized such that τ(1) = 1.

Since H is a Hadamard matrix, [formula] is a commuting square in the sense of [\cite=Po1],[\cite=Po2], i.e. [formula]. The notation EA refers to the τ-invariant conditional expectation from [formula] onto the *  -subalgebra A.

Recall that two complex Hadamard matrices are said to be equivalent if there exist unitary diagonal matrices D1,D2 and permutation matrices P1,P2 such that H2 = P1D1H1D2P2. It is easy to see that H1,H2 are equivalent if and only if [formula] are isomorphic as commuting squares, i.e. conjugate by a unitary from [formula].

We denote by [formula] the commuting square obtained by flipping the upper left and lower right corners of [formula]:

[formula]

We have: [formula]. Thus, [formula] and [formula] are isomorphic as commuting squares if and only if H,H* are equivalent as Hadamard matrices.

We now recall the construction of a subfactor from a commuting square. By iterating Jones' basic construction ([\cite=Jo1]), one obtains from [formula] a tower of commuting squares of finite dimensional *  -algebras:

[formula]

together with the extension of the trace, which we will still denote by τ, and Jones projections gi + 2∈Yi, i = 1,2,....

Let MH be the weak closure of [formula], with respect to the trace τ, and let NH be the weak closure of [formula]. NH,MH are hyperfinite II1 factors, and the trace τ extends continuously to the trace of MH, which we will still denote by τ. It is well known that NH  ⊂  MH is a subfactor of index n, which we will call the subfactor associated to the Hadamard matrix H.

The standard invariant of NH  ⊂  MH can be expressed in terms of commutants of finite dimensional algebras, by using Ocneanu's compactness argument (5.7 in [\cite=JS]). Consider the basic construction for the commuting square [formula]:

[formula]

Ocneanu's compactness theorem asserts that the first row of the standard invariant of NH  ⊂  MH is the row of inclusions:

[formula]

More precisely, if

[formula]

is the Jones tower obtained from iterating the basic construction for the inclusion NH  ⊂  MH, then:

[formula]

Thus, the problem of computing the standard invariant of the subfactor associated to H is the same as the computation of [formula]. However, such computations seem very hard, and even for small i and for matrices H of small dimensions they seem to require computer use. Jones ([\cite=Jo2]) provided a diagrammatic description of the relative commutants [formula] (see also [\cite=JS]), which we express below in the framework of this paper.

Let [formula] and let (ei,j)1  ≤  i,j  ≤  n be its canonical matrix units. Let

[formula]

It is easy to check that e2 is a projection. Moreover: [formula] and e2xe2 = EDn(x)e2 for all [formula]. Thus, e2 is realizing the basic construction

[formula]

Let [formula] denote the n2  ×  n2 matrix having only one non-zero entry, equal to 1, at the intersection of row (i - 1)n + k and column (j - 1)n + l. Thus, [formula] are matrix units of [formula]. In what follows, we will assume that the embedding of [formula] into [formula] is realized as [formula], where [formula].

Let [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula]. Then

[formula]

is a basic construction with Jones projection e3 and

[formula]

is a basic construction with Jones projection e4.

To show that [formula] is a basic construction it is enough to check that [formula] and e3 is implementing [formula]. First part is clear, since [formula] are a basis for [formula]. To check that e3 implements the conditional expectation, let [formula]. We have:

[formula]

Since [formula] is a basic construction, after tensoring to the left by [formula] it follows that [formula] is a basic construction, with [formula].

The algebras P1,P2,P3,... constructed in ([\ref=tower]) are given by

[formula]

with the Jones projections

[formula]

Follows from the previous lemma, by tensoring successively by [formula].

Let H be a complex n  ×  n Hadamard matrix, let [formula], and

[formula]

Then the algebras Q1,Q2,Q3,... constructed in ([\ref=tower]) are given by

[formula]

where Uk∈Pk are the unitary elements:

[formula]

The unitary U1 satisfies:

[formula]

since U*U1 = DU∈Dn. Moreover, we have:

[formula]

It follows that AdU1 takes the basic construction [formula] onto the inclusion [formula]. Thus this is also a basic construction, which shows that [formula]. Moreover, it follows that each [formula] takes the basic construction Pi - 1  ⊂  Pi  ⊂  Pi + 1 onto Qi  ⊂  Qi + 1  ⊂  Qi + 2, which ends the proof.

The first relative commutant [formula] is equal to [formula], since the commuting square condition implies [formula]. Thus the subfactor NH  ⊂  MH is irreducible. In the following proposition we describe the higher relative commutants of the subfactor NH  ⊂  MH as the commutants of some matrices Pi, i  ≥  1.

With the previous notations, let Pi denote the projection Uiei + 3U*i∈Pi + 1, i  ≥  1. Then we have the following formula for the (i + 1)-th relative commutant:

[formula]

We have:

[formula]

We used the fact that [formula] is a basic construction, and thus [formula].

The n2  ×  n2 matrix P1 = U1e4U*1 can be written as

[formula]

This matrix is used in the theory of Hadamard matrices and it is called the profile of H. It is a result of Jones ([\cite=Jo2]) that the matrices P2i + 1, i  ≥  1, depend only on P1. Indeed, one can check that

[formula]

Thus, all higher relative commutants of even orders are determined by P1.

Let ΓH denote the graph of vertices {1,2,...,n}  ×  {1,2,...,n}, in which the distinct vertices (a,c) and (b,d) are connected if and only if [formula]. The second relative commutant can be easily described in terms of ΓH. We recall this in the following Proposition, which is a reformulation of a result in [\cite=Jo2] (see also [\cite=JS]).

The second relative commutant of the subfactor NH  ⊂  MH is abelian, its minimal projections are in bijection with the connected components of ΓH, and their traces are proportional to the sizes of the connected components.

Let [formula], λji∈{0,1}, be a projection in the second relative commutant [formula]. We have:

[formula]

Equivalently:

[formula]

By relabeling and identifying the set of indices, it follows:

[formula]

Thus, if the vertices (a,c) and (i,j) are connected then λca  =  λji. This ends the proof.

Matrices of Dita type

In this section we investigate the standard invariant of subfactors associated to a particular class of Hadamard matrices, obtained by a construction of P.Dita ([\cite=Di]), which is a generalization of an idea of U.Haagerup ([\cite=Haagerup]). These matrices have a lot of symmetries, and we show that for such matrices the second relative commutant has some extra structure besides the Jones projection.

Let n be non-prime, n = kl with k,l  ≥  2. Let [formula] and [formula] be complex Hadamard matrices. It is possible to construct an n  ×  n Hadamard matrix from A,B1,...,Bk by using an idea of [\cite=Di] (see also[\cite=Haagerup],[\cite=Petrescu]). This construction is a generalization of the tensor product of two Hadamard matrices:

[formula]

Let (fi,j)1  ≤  i,j  ≤  k be the matrix units of [formula]. We identify [formula] with the tensor product [formula], with the same conventions as before. Thus:

[formula]

One can use construct multi-parametric families of non-equivalent Hadamard matrices, by replacing B1,...,Bk by B1D1,...BkDk, where D1,...,Dk are diagonal unitaries. Some of the families of Hadamard matrices of small orders considered in the next section arise from this construction.

Recall that the second relative commutant always contains the Jones projection [formula]. In the next proposition we show that the second relative commutant of a Dita type subfactor contains another projection f  ≥  e3, so it has dimension at least 3.

Let [formula] be a Dita type matrix, where [formula] and [formula] are complex Hadamard matrices, n = mk. Then the second relative commutant of the subfactor associated to H contains the projection:

[formula]

For 1  ≤  i  ≤  n, let [formula] and [formula]. We will use similar notations for 1  ≤  j  ≤  n. Thus, the (i,j) entry of H is:

[formula]

where btr,s is the (r,s) entry of Bt, for all 1  ≤  t  ≤  k, 1  ≤  r,s  ≤  m.

With these notations, the projection f can be written as

[formula]

where λji = 1 if i0 = j0 and λji = 0 for all other i,j.

According to Proposition [\ref=second], showing that f is in the second relative commutant is equivalent to showing that pj,di,c = 0 whenever [formula]. Using the formula for the entries of P1 and the fact that i0 = j0 we obtain:

[formula]

whenever [formula].

We show that in fact the subfactor NH  ⊂  MH associated to the Dita matrix H has an intermediate subfactor NH  ⊂  RH  ⊂  MH, and the projection f is the Bisch projection (in the sense of [\cite=Bi]) corresponding to RH.

Let [formula] be a Dita type matrix, where [formula] and [formula] are complex Hadamard matrices, n = mk. Then:

(a). The commuting square [formula] can be decomposed into two adjacent symmetric commuting squares:

[formula]

(b). The commuting square [formula] can be decomposed into two adjacent symmetric commuting squares:

[formula]

(a). We first show that [formula]. Equivalently, we check that [formula]. Indeed, for D∈Dm we have:

[formula]

The lower square of inclusions is clearly a commuting square, since [formula] is a commuting square. We check that

[formula]

is a commuting square. For [formula] and D∈Dk we have:

[formula]

Hence:

[formula]

The lower commuting square is symmetric, since the product of the dimensions of its upper left and lower right corners equals the dimension of its upper right corner. This also implies that the upper commuting square is symmetric, since [formula] is symmetric.

(b). The proof is similar to the proof of part (a).

The subfactors associated to Dita matrices have intermediate subfactors.

By iterating the basic construction for the decomposition of [formula] in commuting squares, we obtain the towers of algebras:

[formula]

where Ri =  < Ri - 1,ei + 2  >    ⊂  Xi. Let RH be the weak closure of [formula]. We have NH  ⊂  RH  ⊂  MH and RH is a II1 factor since the subfactor NH  ⊂  MH is irreducible.

It is immediate to check that the projection [formula] from Proposition [\ref=Dita] implements the conditional expectation from [formula] onto [formula]. It follows that f is the Bisch projection for the intermediate subfactor NH  ⊂  RH  ⊂  MH.

Matrices of small order

In this section we compute the second relative commutants of the subfactors associated to Hadamard matrices of small dimensions. For some of the matrices considered we also specify the dimension of the third relative commutant. Most computations included were done with the help of computers, using GAP and Mathematica.

It is well known in subfactor theory that the dimension of the second relative commutant [formula] is at most n, with equality if and only if H is equivalent to a tensor product of Fourier matrices. In this case the subfactor NH  ⊂  MH is well understood, being a cross-product subfactor. For this reason, we exclude from our analysis tensor products of Fourier matrices.

Some of the matrices we present are parameterized and they yield continuous families of complex Hadamard matrices. In such cases, the strategy for computing the second relative commutant will be to determine which entries of the profile matrix P1 depend on the parameters, and for what values of the parameters are these entries 0. According to Proposition [\ref=second], the second relative commutant will not change as long as the 0 entries of P1 do not change. Thus, to compute the second relative commutant for any other value of the parameters, it is enough to compute it for some random value.

We will describe the second relative commutant by specifying its minimal projections. Each such projection p corresponds to a subset S  ⊂  {1,2,...,n2}: p is the n2  ×  n2 diagonal matrix having 1 on diagonal positions i∈S and 0 on all other positions. Since the Jones projection e3 is always in the second relative commutant, one of the subsets of our partitions will always be {1,n + 2,2n + 3,...,kn + k + 1,...,n2}.

[formula]

Complex Hadamard matrices of dimension 4. There exists, up to equivalence, only one family of complex Hadamard matrices of dimension 4:

[formula]

The entries of P1 that depend on the parameter a are [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula]. Thus, the second relative commutant is the same for all values of a that are not roots of these equations.

The roots a = 1,a =  - 1 yield matrices that are tensor products of 2  ×  2 Fourier matrices. Thus the dimension of the second relative commutant is 4, and its minimal projections are given by the partition {1,6,11,16}, {2,5,12,15}, {3,8,9,14}, {4,7,10,13}.

The roots a = i,a =  - i yield the 4  ×  4 Fourier matrix, thus the minimal projections are {1,6,11,16}, {2,7,12,13}, {3,8,9,14}, {4,5,10,15}.

Any other values of a, |a| = 1, yield relative commutants of dimension 3: {1,6,11,16}, {2,4,5,7,10,12,13,15}, {3,8,9,14}. This is not surprising, since this matrix is of Dita type (see Proposition [\ref=Dita]).

The dimension of the third relative commutant is 10, and the dimension of the fourth relative commutant is 35 unless a is a primitive root of order 8 of unity, in which case the dimension is 36. Based on this evidence, we conjecture that the principal graph of the subfactor associated to F4(a) is D(1)2k if a is a primitive root of order 2k of unity, and D(1)∞ otherwise.

[formula]

Complex Hadamard matrices of dimension 6. The Fourier matrix F6 is part of an affine 2-parameter family of Dita matrices:

[formula]

The entries of P1 that depend on a,b are: [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula].

Making one of these entries 0 yields the following possibilities: [formula] or [formula] or [formula] or [formula] or [formula] or [formula] or [formula] or [formula] or a =  - 1,b =  - 1 or a = 1,b = 1 or a =  - 1,b = 1 or a = 1,b =  - 1.

In each of these cases the matrix F6(a,b) is a tensor product of Fourier matrices.

For all other pairs (a,b) satisfying |a| = |b| = 1, the second relative commutant has dimension 4: {1,8,15,22,29,36}, {2,4,6,7,9,11,14,16,18,19,21,23,26,28,30,31,33,35}, {3,10,17,24,25,32}, {5,12,13,20,27,34}.

[formula]

The following family of self-adjoint, non-affine, complex Hadamard matrices was obtained in [\cite=BeN], one of the motivations being the search for Hadamard matrices of small dimensions that might yield subfactors with no extra structure in their relative commutants, besides the Jones projections.

[formula]

where [formula] and the variables x,y,z,t are given by:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

The entries of BN6 do not depend linearly on the parameters, thus this is not a Dita-type family. The corresponding subfactors have the second relative commutant generated by the Jones projection. We conjecture that BN6(θ) give supertransitive subfactors, i.e. all the relative commutants of higher orders are generated by the Jones projections.

There are other interesting complex Hadamard matrices of order 6, such as the one found by Tao in connection to Fuglede's conjecture ([\cite=T]), or the Haagerup matrix ([\cite=Haagerup],TZ). We computed the second relative commutant for these matrices, and it is generated by the Jones projection.

[formula]

Complex Hadamard matrices of dimension 7. The following one-parameter family was found in [\cite=Petrescu], providing a counterexample to a conjecture of Popa regarding the finiteness of the number of complex Hadamard matrices of prime dimension.

[formula]

The second relative commutant of the associated subfactors is generated by the Jones projection, for all |a| = 1. For a = 1 we also computed the third relative commutant, and it is just the Temperley-Lieb algebra TL2. We conjecture that P7(a) yield subfactors with no extra structure in their higher order relative commutants, besides the Jones projections.

[formula]

Complex Hadamard matrices of dimension 8. The following 5-parameter family of Hadamard matrices contains the Fourier matrix and is of Dita type:

[formula]

The list of possible values of a,b,c,d,z that yield 0 entries for P1 is very long and we do not include it here. Outside these values, the second relative commutant has dimension 4 and it is given by {1,10,19,28,37,46,55,64}, {2,4,6,8,9,11,13,15,18,20,22,24,25,27,29,31,34,36,38,40,41,43,45,47,50,52,54,56,57,59,61,63}, {3,7,12,16,17,21,26,30,35,39,44,48,49,53,58,62}, {5,14,23,32,33,42,51,60}.

[formula]

[formula]

We analysed several other complex Hadamard matrices besides those included in this paper, such as those found by [\cite=MRS],[\cite=Sz]. We tried to cover most known examples of complex Hadamard matrices of dimensions 2,3,...,11. We draw some conclusions:

Matrices of Dita type yield subfactors with intermediate subfactors, and thus the second relative commutant has some extra structure besides the Jones projection. We note that parametric families of Dita type exist for every n non-prime, and they contain the Fourier matrix Fn.

All non-Dita, non-Fourier matrices we tested have the second relative commutant generated by the Jones projection. The third relative commutant is also generated by the first two Jones projections for all cases we could compute. It remains an open problem whether there exist such complex Hadamard matrices that admit symmetries of higher order.
