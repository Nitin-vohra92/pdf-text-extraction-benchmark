Energy of 4-Dimensional Black Hole

Possible Modification of Stress-Energy

The standard definition of mass-density, μ, for mass,

[formula]

where γ is determinant of metric for spacial line-element, lacks manifest dependence on speed of motion, v, and on gravitational interaction with other masses. Since this dependence is important in what follows below, we should 're-define' the mass-density. Consider, first, flat spacetime with Cartesian coordinates. For the mass, dm, moving with speed, v, one may write,

[formula]

here μ* is density of the rest-mass. Formula ([\ref=1.2]) may be rewritten as

[formula]

where dΩ  =  cdtdV is 4-dimensional volume, and ds2  =  gab  dxadxb. In the third line of ([\ref=1.3]) we transfered to a general coordinate system, with metric gab. By definition ([\ref=1.3]), μ* is a scalar field not depending on speed, in difference with standard mass-density, μ, ([\ref=1.1]), which depends on speed and is not a scalar at all. Suppose, now, that the mass, dm, is at rest, but in a gravitational field [formula], where φ(x) is the gravitational potential. From ([\ref=1.3]) it follows, then,

[formula]

where from the second line ([\ref=1.5]) follows that μ*  =  μ. Using standard technique, we obtain the stress-energy for distribution of masses [\cite=Landau],

Energy of the Black Hole

In the work [\cite=Pal] it was shown that if the timelike Killing vector field, ξa, satisfying equations,

[formula]

exists, then the energy integral exists, too:

[formula]

Consider the Schwarzschild solution,

[formula]

Solving ([\ref=2.1]), we obtain the timelike Killing vector,

[formula]

Substituting ([\ref=1.6]), ([\ref=2.3]), ([\ref=2.4]) in ([\ref=2.2]), and using dV  =  drdθdφ, we obtain,

[formula]

Transfering to Cartesian coordinates, (r,θ,φ)  →  (x1,x2,x3), and introducing the mass-density,

[formula]

we obtain for energy, E  =  Mc2.
