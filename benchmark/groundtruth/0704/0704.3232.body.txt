Characterization of polynomials

Introduction

In [\cite=Corominas_Balaguer] it was proved that if [formula], [formula], and for every [formula] there exists [formula] such that f(n(x))(x) = 0, then f is a polynomial. Later, see [\cite=Boghossian_Johnson] and [\cite=Plesniak] a similar result was proved for multi-variable case.

To extend this result for distributions first we introduce some notations and recall some known results, see e.g. in [\cite=Rudin]. Let [formula] be a non-empty open set. In the discussion of functions of n variables, the term multi-index denotes an ordered n-tuple

[formula]

of nonnegative integers αi [formula]. With each multi-index α is associated the differential operator

[formula]

whose order is [formula]. If [formula] then Dαf: = f.

The support of a complex function f on any topological space is the closure of the set [formula].

If K is a compact set in Ω then DK denotes the vector subspace of all complex-valued function f∈C∞(Ω) whose support lies in K, C∞0(Ω) is the set of all f∈C∞(Ω) whose support is compact and lies in Ω. It is possible to define a topology on C∞(Ω) (generated by the [formula] norms) which makes C∞(Ω) into a Fr�chet space (locally convex topological vector space whose topology is induced by a complete invariant metric), such that DK is a closed subspace of C∞(Ω), τK denotes the Fr�chet space topology of DK.

Choose the non-empty compact sets Ki  ⊂  Ω [formula] such that Ki lies in the interior of Ki + 1 and [formula], τKi denotes the Fr�chet space topology of DKi. Denote τ the inductive limit topology of τKi [formula].

The topological vector space of test functions D(Ω) is C∞0(Ω) with τ. This topology is independent of the choice of Ki [formula]. A linear functional on D(Ω) which is continuous with respect to τ is called a distribution in Ω. The space of all distributions in Ω is denoted by D'(Ω).

In [\cite=Corominas_Balaguer] the polynomiality was proved using Baire's theorem ([formula] is a complete metric space). In our case D(Ω) is not metrizable and the topology τ is not locally compact so we can not apply Baire's theorem to D(Ω) immediately.

Results

In the next result we assume that Ω and Ki [formula] are connected sets, if Ω had components then we could apply our results for each component.

If u∈D'(Ω) and for every φ∈D(Ω) there exists [formula] such that [formula] for all multi-indeces α satisfying [formula], then u is a polynomial (in distributional sense).

Proofs

To proof the Theorem we need lemmas.

If [formula] then [formula] means ai < bi, [formula]. The set [formula] is the n-dimensional open interval.

Suppose Γ is an open cover of an open set [formula], and suppose that to each ω∈Γ corresponds a distribution, Λω∈D'(ω) such that

[formula]

whenever [formula].

Then there exists a unique Λ∈D'(Ω) such that

[formula]

for every ω∈Γ.

See e.g. [\cite=Rudin] 6.21 Theorem.

Assume [formula] and [formula] are n-dimensional intervals, φ∈D(I  ×  J). Then there exists φk∈D(I  ×  J) such that

[formula]

where ψj∈D(I), χj∈D(J) and φk converges to φ in D(I  ×  J).

See e.g. [\cite=Simon] page 111-113.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:distribution]:

In the first step we prove that for each [formula] there exists a number [formula] such that [formula] for all multi-indeces α satisfying [formula] in DKi. Denote

[formula]

Obviously

[formula]

Here Z(m) is closed, because

[formula]

and Dαu is continuous. Since DKi is a complete metrizable space, Baire's theorem gives there exists [formula] such that [formula] ([formula] is in the topology τi). Since Z(m) is a linear subspace in DKi, we obtain [formula].

In the second step we consider the one variable case. If n = 1 then [formula] implies u is a polynomial (in distributional sense) in DKi, see [\cite=Vladimirov], Exercise 7.23, p. 99. Since [formula] and DKi  ⊂  DKi + 1 we obtain the theorem in this case.

In the third step we consider the multivariable case. Since open intervals form a base for open sets in [formula], we can write [formula], where Γ is an open cover of [formula]. If we prove that u is a polynomial (in distributional sense) in each ω, then by Lemma [\ref=lem:cover] we obtain that u is a polynomial (in distributional sense) in [formula]. Since DKi  ⊂  DKi + 1 we obtain the theorem.

Write [formula], where [formula], [formula] are open intervals. Let φ∈D(ω). By an obvious generalization of Lemma [\ref=lem:dense] there exists a sequence of φk∈D(ω) such that φk has the form

[formula]

with N: = N(k), where ψ(m)j∈D(Ii), [formula], [formula] and φk converges to φ in D(ω). Since u is continuous, u(φk)  →  u(φ). Hence it is enough to prove, that u acts on φk as a polynomial (in distributional sense).

We proved that [formula] in D(ω). It means

[formula]

If we define vj∈D'(I1) such that

[formula]

where ψ(1)∈D(I1), (we consider [formula] as parameters), then we obtain [formula]. The one variable case implies that [formula], where pj is a polynomial of degree at most γ(i) - 1,

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

Continuing this idea, we know that [formula] in D(ω). From this and one variable case we obtain

[formula]

Similarly, we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

Repeating this process with [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula] we obtain that u acts on φk as a polynomial (in distributional sense) indeed, and the proof of the theorem has completed. [formula]
