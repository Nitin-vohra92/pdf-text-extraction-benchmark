STBCs from Representation of Extended Clifford Algebras

Introduction

Space-Time Coding is a coding technique for the Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) channel to exploit the spatial diversity that is available in the physical channel. However, Maximum Likelihood (ML) decoding of general STBCs becomes computationally prohibitive especially for large number of transmit antennas. For this reason, Complex Orthogonal Designs (CODs) [\cite=TJC] [\cite=TiH] and quasi-orthogonal designs [\cite=TBH] [\cite=Jaf] were studied. In [\cite=KhR], a class of codes called Co-ordinate Interleaved Orthogonal Designs (CIODs) were proposed which were single complex ML decodable and also had higher rate than CODs. Further, necessary and sufficient conditions to obtain single complex symbol ML decodable codes were provided. Recently in [\cite=KaR1] [\cite=KaR3] [\cite=KaR2] [\cite=YGT], this notion of reduced ML decoding complexity has been put in the more general framework of g-group ML decodable or λ-real symbol ML decodable STBCs. In [\cite=KaR1] [\cite=KaR3], a special class of multi-symbol ML decodable codes called Clifford Unitary Weight (CUW) codes was introduced. These STBCs were based on a set of sufficient conditions for g-group ML decodability. The authors of [\cite=KaR1] [\cite=KaR3] also provided an explicit construction of CUW codes by performing matrix manipulations on the representation matrices of Clifford algebras. Recently in [\cite=RaR_isit_p3], an algebraic framework based on 'Extended Clifford Algebras' (Definition [\ref=def_ECA]) has been introduced for constructing CUW codes. Using the framework of Extended Clifford Algebras, 4-group ML decodable distributed space-time codes for cooperative diversity have been obtained in [\cite=RaR_isit_p3]. Distributed space-time codes need to satisfy certain special conditions and these issues have been addressed in [\cite=RaR_isit_p3]. Interestingly, using 'Extended Clifford Algebras' and some special signal set constructions, distributed differential space-time codes have been obtained in [\cite=RaR_isit_p2] for application in cooperative wireless networks with no channel state information.

In this paper, we focus only on STBCs for the colocated MIMO channel (no co-operation case). Though few CUW code constructions are available in the literature [\cite=KaR1] [\cite=KaR3] [\cite=KaR2] [\cite=YGT], the maximal rate of CUW codes is still not addressed. For the solitary case of single complex symbol ML decodable codes alone, a solution is available in [\cite=KaR1]. In this paper, we obtain the maximal rate of CUW codes using representation theory of finite groups and the algebraic framework of Extended Clifford Algebras.

The main contributions of this paper are as follows.

Using tools from representation theory, the maximal rate of CUW codes is found for the case of [formula].

Two algebraic constructions of CUW codes with maximal rates are then provided. One of the constructions (in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm_maxrate]) is obtained using linear representation of finite groups whereas the other construction (in Section [\ref=sec5]) is based on the concept of right module algebra over non-commutative rings. To our knowledge, this is the first paper in which matrices over non-commutative rings is used to construct STBCs.

An algebraic explanation is given for the 'ABBA' construction originally proposed in [\cite=TBH] and the recently proposed tensor product construction in [\cite=KaR2] which are also of maximal rate.

It is shown that the STBC for 4 transmit antennas proposed in [\cite=TBH] based on the ABBA construction is actually a single complex symbol ML decodable code if the design variables are permuted and appropriate signal sets are chosen. Previously this design has been treated to be a double complex symbol ML decodable code.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section [\ref=sec2], the problem statement is described. In Section [\ref=sec3], an introduction to the algebraic tools used in this paper is given. The maximal rate of CUW codes and an algebraic explanation for the tensor product construction in [\cite=KaR2] is given in Section [\ref=sec4]. An algebraic explanation for the ABBA construction is given in Section [\ref=sec5] and discussions on further work comprise Section [\ref=sec6].

Notation: For a complex matrix A, AI denotes the real matrix obtained by taking the real parts of all the entries of A and AQ denotes the real matrix obtained by taking the imaginary parts of all the entries of A. If M is a module over a ring B, then EndB(M) denotes the set of all B linear maps from M to M. For a vector space V, GL(V) denotes the set of invertible linear transformations from V to itself.

Problem Statement

In this section, we briefly introduce CUW codes and formulate the problem statement. We refer the readers to [\cite=KaR3] for a detailed explanation.

Consider a Nt  ×  Nt linear design or linear STBC S in K real variables [formula]. It can be written as

[formula]

where, [formula] is called the weight matrix corresponding to the real variable xi. Let K = gλ where, λ denotes the maximum number of real variables we would like to jointly decode and g is the number of groups into which the K real variables will be partitioned into. Let us list down the weight matrices in the form of an array as follows.

Without loss of generality we shall consider the following partition. All the weight matrices in one column will belong to one group. Moreover, we assume all the weight matrices to be unitary and furthermore set A1 = I. Then, it has been shown in [\cite=KaR1] [\cite=KaR3] that to obtain a a g-group ML decodable linear design as required, it is sufficient to design the matrices in the first row and the first column such that they satisfy the following conditions.

The matrices in the first row except A1 = I should form a Hurwitz-Radon family. In other words, all the matrices in the first row except A1 = I should square to - I and should pair-wise anti-commute among themselves.

The matrices in the first column should square to I and should commute with all the matrices in the first row and first column.

Once such a set of matrices is obtained, the matrix in the i-th row and the j-th column can be filled up by multiplying Ai and A(j - 1)λ + 1. Such a set of weight matrices will result in a linear design which will be λ-real symbol ML decodable. In other words, the ML decoding metric will split into a sum of g-terms such that each term is a function of atmost λ real variables. Thus ML decoding can be performed by jointly decoding atmost λ real variables. Linear STBCs satisfying the sufficient conditions 1) and 2) stated above are called CUW codes.

In this paper, we are interested in the maximum rate [formula] (in complex symbols per channel use) of CUW codes. This problem can be formally stated in many equivalent ways. Some of them are listed as follows.

Given λ and Nt what is the maximum value of R?

Given g and Nt what is the maximum value of R?

Given g and λ what is the minimum value of Nt?

For λ = 2, the solution to the first question is reported in [\cite=KaR1]. In Section [\ref=sec4] of this paper the solution to question number [\ref=question]) for [formula] is provided.

Algebraic tools

In this Section, we briefly introduce the algebraic framework first proposed in [\cite=RaR_isit_p3] to construct CUW codes. Then we recall few definitions from algebra and restate the problem described in the previous section in algebraic terms.

A nonempty set B equipped with two binary operations called addition and multiplication denoted by +   and . is called a ring denoted by (B, + ,.) if

(B, + ) is a Abelian group

(B,.) is a monoid with multiplicative identity 1

[formula]

[formula]

A nonempty set A equipped with two binary operations called addition and multiplication denoted by +   and . is called a right module algebra over a ring B if

(A, + ,.) is a ring

There is a map (x,α)  →  xα of A  ×  B into A satisfying the following for [formula] and [formula].

[formula]

Note that in the standard mathematical literature (for eg [\cite=Jac]), algebra is defined over a field. Since our definition differs from the definition in [\cite=Jac], we have given the name 'right module algebra' in order to distinguish it from the concept of algebra over a field.

[\cite=RaR_isit_p3] Let [formula]. An Extended Clifford algebra denoted by [formula] is the associative algebra over [formula]  generated by n + a objects [formula] and [formula] which satisfy the following relations:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

It is clear that the classical Clifford algebra, denoted by Cliffn, is obtained when only the first two relations are satisfied and there are no δi. Cliffn is a sub-algebra of [formula]. Let [formula] be the natural [formula]  basis for this sub-algebra. Then a natural [formula]  basis for [formula] is

[formula]

where

[formula]

The algebra [formula] over [formula] can also be viewed as a right module algebra over the base ring Cliffn. We will use this fact later in Section [\ref=sec5].

From the defining relations of the generators of the Extended Clifford Algebra, it can be observed that the symbols 1, γ1, γ2, [formula], γn satisfy relations similar to that satisfied by the weight matrices that we need in the first row (squaring to - 1 and anticommuting). Similarly the symbols [formula], [formula] satisfy relations similar to that satisfied by the weight matrices that we need in the first column (squaring to 1 and commuting with all other elements). Thus when the weight matrices of any CUW code are expressed in the array form as discussed in the previous section, the matrices in the first row will simply be matrix representations of the symbols 1, γ1, γ2, [formula], γn of a Extended Clifford Algebra. Similarly the matrices in the first column are nothing but matrix representation of the symbols [formula], [formula] of a Extended Clifford Algebra. Thereby the entire problem as described in the previous section can now be restated in algebraic terms as follows.

What is the minimum matrix size Nt in which the algebra [formula] has a non-trivial matrix representation?

Maximum rate of CUW codes

In this section, the maximum rate of CUW codes is found using tools from representation theory for [formula]. Then, an algebraic explanation is given for the tensor product based CUW code construction in [\cite=KaR2].

As discussed in the previous section, the problem is to find the minimum dimension in which we can have a representation of the algebra [formula]. But this problem appears to be difficult to solve directly. Hence we take an alternate approach which is similar to the approach in [\cite=TiH] wherein matrix representations of Clifford algebras was obtained using matrix representations of the Clifford group. First we find a finite group with respect to multiplication in the algebra [formula] such that it contains the elements of the natural [formula]-basis of [formula] denoted by [formula]. Then we find a suitable representation of this finite group such that it can be extended to a representation of the algebra.

The set of elements

[formula]

is a finite group with respect to multiplication in [formula]. Further, the group G is a direct product of its subgroups Gμ and Gδ, where

[formula]

The multiplication is associative and the unit is 1. The inverse of the element [formula] is [formula]. The inverse of the element [formula] is itself. Similarly, it is easy to find the inverse of the other elements. The set Gμ is nothing but the well known Clifford group [\cite=TiH]. The set Gδ is a group obviously, since it is a direct product of the cyclic group C2, a number of times. The group G is a direct product of Gμ and Gδ because of the following reasons.

Each s∈G can be written uniquely in the form s = s1s2 with s1∈Gμ and s2∈Gδ.

For s1∈Gμ and s2∈Gδ, we have s1s2 = s2s1.

Thus, the problem is simplified to finding the matrix representation of this finite group G. To start, we quickly recall some basic concepts in linear representation of finite groups. We refer the readers to [\cite=Serre] for a formal introduction.

[\cite=Serre] Let G be a finite group with identity element 1 and let V be a finite dimensional vector space over [formula]. A linear representation of G in V is a group homomorphism ρ from G into the group GL(V). The dimension of V is called the degree of the representation.

Irreducible representations are representations with no invariant subspaces.

Every representation is a direct sum of irreducible representations. They are equivalent to block-diagonal representations, with irreducible representation matrices on the block diagonal.

Two representations R and R' of G are equivalent, if there exists a similarity transform U so that

[formula]

Unitary group representations are representations in terms of unitary matrices

Every representation is equivalent to a unitary representation

[\cite=Serre] All the irreducible representations of an Abelian group have degree 1.

[\cite=Serre] Let ρ1:G1  →  GL(V1) and ρ2:G2  →  GL(V2) be linear representations of groups G1 and G2 in vector spaces V1 and V2 respectively. Then [formula] is a linear representation of G1  ×  G2 into [formula].

If ρ1 and ρ2 are irreducible, then [formula] is an irreducible representation of G1  ×  G2.

Each irreducible representation of G1  ×  G2 is equivalent to a representation [formula], where ρi is an irreducible representation of Gi, ~ i = 1,2.

Now that we have introduced the necessary tools required, the problem is to find unitary matrix representations of the finite group G. Before we proceed, note that when G is interpreted as a finite group, the representation of - 1 does not necessarily have anything to do with - 1 times identity matrix and similarly for a generic [formula]. Such a representation ρ, where ρ( - 1)  ≠    -  ρ(1) is said to be a degenerate representation. Degenerate representations are not representations of the algebra [formula]. Thus we are interested in a non-degenerate unitary representation ρ of the finite group G such that the following conditions are satisfied.

[formula].

[formula]

The degree of representation should be as small as possible.

The first two conditions are required for unique decodability [\cite=KaR1], since otherwise there will be problems in decoding for certain choice of signal sets. This issue is elaborated in [\cite=KaR1] and hence not repeated here.

The maximum rate (in complex symbols per channel use) of a λ-real symbol ML decodable CUW code in K = gλ real variables for [formula] is given by

[formula]

Let us first consider the case λ = 2 and arbitrary g. Then the finite group G = Gμ  ×  Gδ, where [formula]. Since we are interested in minimizing the degree of representation, we first study the irreducible representations of G. From Theorem [\ref=thm_tensor], we know that all the irreducible representations of G are obtained as tensor product of the irreducible representations of Gμ and Gδ. All the irreducible representations of Gμ are available in [\cite=TiH]. The non-degenerate irreducible representations of Gμ are also available in [\cite=TiH] for dimension [formula]. Let us denote the non-degenerate representation of Gμ by ρ1. The group Gδ is Abelian. Thus, from Theorem [\ref=thm_abelian], all the irreducible representations of Gδ are in dimension 1. Apart from the trivial representation (all elements are mapped to 1), there is only one irreducible representation ρ2 of Gδ given by

[formula]

Thus, we have explicitly obtained all the irreducible representations of G for the case λ = 2. They are in dimension [formula]. However, all the irreducible representations of G fail to satisfy the required conditions. Thus we seek reducible representations of G. Reducible representations can be easily constructed by placing irreducible representations on the blocks of the diagonal. By doing so, it can be checked that the smallest dimension reducible representation ρ of G satisfying the requirements is [formula]. It is given explicitly as follows.

[formula]

where, [formula]. By applying the same arguments as in the case of λ = 2 repeatedly, it can be shown that the smallest degree of representation satisfying the requirements for [formula] is [formula]. Thus the maximum rate is given by [formula]

Note that the expression for Rmax is independent of λ. Moreover, the construction of maximal rate CUW code for λ = 2 in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm_maxrate] can be easily generalized for any [formula]. Observe that such a construction leads to weight matrices with a block diagonal structure. This is because we use reducible representation of groups.

Algebraic explanation for Tensor product construction

In [\cite=KaR2], a construction of CUW codes based on tensor products was provided without giving any reasoning for the mathematical source of such a construction. With the algebraic background that we have now developed, the tensor product construction in [\cite=KaR2] can be easily explained. Since the group G is a direct product of Gμ and Gδ, from Lemma [\ref=lem_tensor], a representation of G can be obtained as a tensor product of a representation of Gμ and that of Gδ. The unitary matrix representation of Gμ is available in [\cite=TiH]. The unitary matrices representing Gδ should commute and also square to I. Such matrices can be constructed easily, since they are simultaneously diagonalizable and their eigen values are equal to ±  1 (squaring to I). The construction suggested in [\cite=KaR2] is precisely based on this principle.

Algebraic explanation for ABBA construction

In this section, an algebraic explanation is given for the 'ABBA' construction [\cite=TBH] based on the concept of right module algebra over non-commutative rings.

As illustrated in Section [\ref=sec3], the algebra [formula] over [formula] can also be viewed as a finitely generated right module algebra over Cliffn. Let L = 2a. Then a general element x of the algebra [formula] can be written as follows.

[formula]

where [formula]. There is a natural embedding of [formula] into [formula] given by left multiplication as follows.

[formula]

It is easy to check that the map Lx is Cliffn linear and the map φ is a ring homomorphism. Hence, we can represent the algebra [formula] by matrices with entries from Clifford algebra. However, we are only interested in matrix representations with entries from the complex field. But this can be easily obtained by simply replacing each Clifford algebra element by its matrix representation over [formula]. This is possible because the matrix representation of Cliffn over [formula] is well known and is explicitly given in [\cite=TiH]. We now illustrate this with an example. Thus the map Lx can be represented as the following matrix

[formula]

where, c1,c2,c3,c4∈Cliffn. Now to get a matrix representation over [formula], we simply replace each [formula] by their matrix representations over [formula]. However, to get a λ-real symbol ML decodable code, we are interested only in the linear design obtained using matrix representation of the specific elements [formula], [formula], 1, γ1, γ2, [formula], γn of the algebra. This can be obtained by simply restricting the representation to the subspace over [formula] generated by the required elements of the algebra. In other words, we put zero for the coefficients corresponding to the terms not required. Thus, we simply replace [formula] by CODs. Hence, we obtain a λ-real symbol ML decodable CUW code with maximal rate. It turns out that the above construction is precisely the ABBA construction proposed by Tirkkonen et al in [\cite=TBH].

As a consequence of this result, it follows that the 4 transmit antenna linear design based on ABBA construction shown below is a 2-real symbol ML decodable code

Though the same linear design was proposed earlier in [\cite=TBH], the authors of [\cite=TBH] chose the following pairing of real variables which essentially made the linear design into a 4-real symbol ML decodable code.

First group [formula]

Second group [formula]

Third group [formula]

Fourth group [formula].

However, if we form the following partition of real variables, we can obtain a single complex symbol ML decodable code.

First group [formula]

Second group [formula]

Third group [formula]

Fourth group [formula].

Note that the pair of real variables in one group should be allowed to take values independently of the real variables in other groups. For example, the pair of real variables x1I,x3I should take values jointly from a two dimensional constellation independently of the real variables in other groups. Thus we see that the ML decoding complexity of STBCs obtained from linear designs can vary dramatically depending on the partitioning of real variables into groups and the choice of signal sets.

Discussions

The CUW codes [\cite=KaR1] [\cite=KaR3] [\cite=KaR2] are based on sufficient conditions for g-group ML decodability. An algebraic framework for g-group ML decodable codes based on the necessary and sufficient conditions and the maximal rate of general g-group ML decodable codes are currently under investigation.
