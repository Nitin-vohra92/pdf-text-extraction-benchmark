An analysis of celestial pole offset observations in the free core nutation frequency band

Presented at the EGU 4th General Assembly, Vienna, Austria, 15-20 April 2007

Known empirical FCN models

To date, three empirical FCN models have been developed: MHB2000 [\cite=Herring02], Malkin (ZM) [\cite=Malkin03h], Lambert (SL) [\cite=McCarthy05]. Comparison of these models with results of VLBI observations shows that all three models allow one to account equally essentially for the FCN contribution. However, as can be seen from fig. [\ref=fig:fcnpar], ZM model provides smooth and, apparently, more realistic representation of variations of the basic geophysical parameters, the FCN amplitude and phase.

It should be noted, however, that all models only approximate the observed variations in the celestial pole offset, without striking into the FCN physical properties. Further development of FCN model can be reached by consideration of a two-frequency FCN theory. Earlier, Malkin and Terentev revealed a second fluctuation with the period about 410 solar days in the celestial pole offset series [\cite=Malkin03a] [\cite=Malkin03c]. However, then this fact has not been given due value. Later, Schmidt et al. [\cite=Schmidt05] have shown the presence of two periods - 435 and - 410 days by means of the wavelet analysis with high frequency resolution. They supposed that observed variations in the FCN amplitude and phase are caused by beating between two oscillations with close periods. A theoretical explanation of this phenomenon has been given by Krasinsky [\cite=Krasinsky06a] in his numerical theory of rotation of the Earth, ERA2005, considering two-layer structure of the fluid core.

In this paper, we performed more detailed analysis of the celestial pole offset time series provided by the International VLBI Service for Geodesy and Astrometry (IVS) for the period 1989-2006. Earlier observations were not analyzed in view of their relatively low accuracy [\cite=Malkin03h] [\cite=Malkin04a]. The smoothed differences between the observed celestial pole offset values and those predicted by the IAU200A model were used in our study.

Spectrum analysis

Firstly, we applied the discrete Fourier spectral analysis to the analyzed time series. We computed the Schuster periodogram for complex series X + iY. Usually for the spectrum analysis, the Fast Fourier Transform technique, which provides calculation of the spectrum estimations on a grid of frequencies, multiple to Nyquist frequency that does not provide the detailed frequency resolution, is used. To increase the frequency resolution, we used direct calculation of spectrum estimates, which allowed us to use any, as much as dense grid of frequencies (periods). Also, for increase of the frequency resolution, a frequency window was not applied, which does not lead to deterioration of results in this case, as initial data are smooth enough, and we study narrow enough band of a spectrum. The spectra of the differences between the IVS celestial pole offset time series and those predicted by the ERA2005 model are presented in Fig. [\ref=fig:spectra], which shows reasonably good agreement of the ERA2005 theory and observations. Also in the investigated time series, the annual component is surely revealed, but with essentially smaller amplitude, than the FCN components.

Principal components analysis

The second method we used for investigation of the celestial pole offset series was Principal Component Analysis (PCA) also known as Singular Spectrum Analysis. The "Caterpillar" software developed at the St. Petersburg State University was used for computation ( http://www.gistatgroup.com/cat/). It should be mentioned that, except harmonic components, PCA allow one to isolate an actual long-term trend component not burdened by any assumption about its a priori model. Usually, the trend contribution in an analyzed time series as determined from the PCA is large enough (40.5% in our case), and it can distort the harmonic components under investigation. To mitigate this effect, we performed the computations in two iterations. At the first iteration, all principal components were resolved, and at second one, the main trend components found at the first iteration were removed from the input time series. Fig. [\ref=fig:pc] shows the original time series and two principal components PC1 and PC2 found from the analysis. Three most valuable harmonic components are those with periods 452 solar days (the contribution is equal to 53.8%), 409 days (19.0%) and 366 days (6.8%). Specified period values were found from the spectral analysis made in the same way as described in the previous section.

Wavelet analysis

To investigate how the two FCN components vary with time, the wavelet technique was applied to the IVS celestial pole offset, two harmonic principal components found from the PCA and ERA2005 time series. The WWZ software ( http://www.aavso.org/) developed at the American Association of Variable Star Observers was used for analysis. The mathematical background of this method is described in [\cite=Foster96c]. Results of the wavelet analysis are presented in Fig. [\ref=fig:wavelet-fcn]. Two periodic components can be clearly seen at both observed and theoretical time series. For better comparison, we applied the wavelet with the same parameter Ïƒ=10 as was used in [\cite=Schmidt05], which provides high frequency resolution. The time resolution is rather pure in such a case however. So, wavelet estimates,in fact, are averaged for many-year interval.

Discussion and conclusion

In this paper, we investigated the IVS celestial pole offset time series as well as theoretical ERA 2005 time series by means of three statistical tools, Discrete Fourier Transform, Principal Component Analysis and wavelet analysis, in the FCN frequency band. The results obtained with all the methods definitely show presence of two harmonic components with periods about - 410 and - 452 solar days, yet these methods are not fully independent.

This result confirms ones obtained in [\cite=Malkin03a] [\cite=Malkin03c] [\cite=Schmidt05] from VLBI data processing and the ERA2005 theory [\cite=Krasinsky06a] [\cite=Krasinsky06b]. However, the values of the FCN component periods found here and obtained in the previous papers are substantially different. Moreover, supplement study has shown that the period of FCN components depend on the time span of data used for analysis. So, further investigations are needed before making a final conclusion. Also, it's important to compare these results with the resonance FCN period, see e.g. [\cite=Vondrak05], in particular, considering a two-component resonance model.

Finally, we can hope that using two-component empirical FCN model, in case it is proved to be real, will allow us to predict the FCN contribution to the nutation series with better accuracy than existing models.
