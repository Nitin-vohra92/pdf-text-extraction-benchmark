Introduction

A mapping from the set of all q-ary vectors of length m to the set of all permutations of [formula] is called a distance-preserving mapping (DPM) if every two distinct vectors are mapped to permutations with the same or even larger Hamming distance mutual than that of the vectors. A distance-increasing mapping (DIM) is a special DPM such that the distances are strictly increased except when that is obviously not possible. DPMs and DIMs are useful for the construction of permutation arrays (PAs) which are applied to various applications, such as trellis code modulations and power line communications [\cite=1], [\cite=7], [\cite=29], [\cite=28], [\cite=2], [\cite=3], [\cite=30], [\cite=4], [\cite=5], [\cite=6]. All DPMs and DIMs proposed so far are from binary vectors: [\cite=10], [\cite=21], [\cite=11], [\cite=8], [\cite=25], [\cite=24], [\cite=9], [\cite=23], [\cite=27], [\cite=12], [\cite=22], [\cite=26]. In this paper we propose a general construction method to construct DPMs or DIMs from ternary vectors. By using this method, we construct DIMs for n  =  m  +  2 for m  ≥  3, DPMs for n  =  m  +  1 for m  ≥  9, and DPMs for n  =  m for m  ≥  13.

The paper is organized as follows. In the next section we introduce some notations and state our main results. In Section 3 we introduce a general recursive construction of DPMs and DIMs. In Sections 4 and 5 we introduce mappings that can be used to start the recursion in the three cases we consider. Finally, in an appendix, we give explicit listings of the values of some mappings that are used as building blocks to construct the mappings given in Sections 4 and 5.

Notations and main results

Let Sn denote the set of all n! permutations of [formula]. A permutation π:Fn  →  Fn is represented by an n-tuple [formula] where πi  =  π(i). Let Zn3 denote the set of all ternary vectors of length n. The Hamming distance between two n-tuples [formula] and [formula] is denoted by [formula] and is defined as

[formula]

Let Fn,k be the set of injective functions from Zn3 to Sn + k. Note that Fn,k is empty if (n + k)! < 3n.

For k  ≥  0, let Pn,k be the set of functions in Fn,k such that

[formula]

for all [formula]. These mappings are called distance preserving mappings (DPM).

For k  ≥  1, let In,k be the set of functions in Fn,k such that

[formula]

for all distinct [formula]. These mappings are called distance increasing mappings (DIM).

Our main result is the following theorem.

a) In,2 is non-empty for n  ≥  3.

b) Pn,1 is non-empty for n  ≥  9.

c) Pn,0 is non-empty for n  ≥  13.

The proof of the theorem is constructive. A relatively simple recursive method is given (in the next section) to construct a mapping of length n + 1 from a mapping of length n. Explicit mappings that start the recursion in the three cases are given in last part of the paper, including the appendix.

An (n,d) permutation array (PA) is a subset of Sn such that the Hamming distance between any two distinct permutations in the array is at least d. An (n,d;q) code is a subset of vectors (codewords) of length n over an alphabet of size q and with distance at least d between distinct codewords. One construction method of PAs is to construct an (n,d')-PA from an (m,d;q) code using DPMs or DIMs. More precisely, if C is an (m,d;q) code and there exists an DPM f from Zmq to Sn, then f(C) is an (n,d) PA. If f is DIM, then f(C) is an (n,d + 1) PA. This has been a main motivation for studying DPMs. Let P(n,d) denote the largest possible size of an (n,d)-PA. The exact value of P(n,d) is still an open problem in most cases, but we can lower bound this value by the maximal size of a suitable code provided a DPM (or DIM) is known. Let Aq(n,d) denote the largest possible size of an (n,d) code over a code alphabet of size q. In [\cite=8], Chang et al. used this approach to show that for n  ≥  4 and 2  ≤  d  ≤  n, we have P(n,d)  ≥  A2(n,d - 1). In [\cite=12], Chang further improved the bound to P(n,d)  ≤  A2(n,d - δ) for n  ≥  nδ and δ + 1  ≤  d  ≤  n where δ  ≥  2 and nδ is a positive integer determined by δ, e.g. n2  =  16.

From Theorem [\ref=main] we get the following bounds.

a) For n  ≥  5 and 2  ≤  d  ≤  n, we have

[formula]

b) For n  ≥  10 and 2  ≤  d  ≤  n, we have

[formula]

c) For n  ≥  13 and 2  ≤  d  ≤  n, we have

[formula]

Bounds on A2(n,d) and A3(n,d) have been studied by many researchers, see e.g. [\cite=13] and [\cite=14]. In general, the lower bounds on P(n,d) obtained from use of ternary codes are better than those obtained from binary codes. For example, using Chang's bound [formula], we get P(16,5)  ≥  A2(16,3)  ≥  2720, whereas Theorem [\ref=newPA] gives P(16,5)  ≥  A3(16,5)  ≥  19683. Similarly, we get P(16,9)  ≥  A2(16,7)  ≥  36 and P(16,9)  ≥  A3(16,9)  ≥  243.

The general recursive construction.

For any array [formula], we use the notation [formula].

We start with a recursive definition of functions from Zn3 to Sn + k. For f∈Fn,k, define g = H(f)∈Fn + 1,k as follows. Let [formula] and [formula]. Suppose that the element n + k - 4 occurs in position r, that is φr = n + k - 4. Then

[formula],

[formula] otherwise;

[formula],

[formula],

[formula] otherwise;

if n is odd or xn < 2, then

[formula],

[formula],

[formula] otherwise;

if n is even and xn = 2, then

[formula],

[formula],

[formula] otherwise.

We note that [formula] for at most one value of i  ≤  n + k.

For f∈Fm,k, we define a sequence of functions f∈Fn,k, for all n  ≥  m, recursively by

[formula]

If fm∈Pm,k where k  ≥  0, m is odd, and

[formula]

then fn∈Pn,k for all n  ≥  m.

If fm∈Im,k, where k > 0 and m is odd, and

[formula]

then fn∈In,k for all n  ≥  m.

Proof: We prove Theorem [\ref=t2]; the proof of Theorem [\ref=t1] is similar (and a little simpler). The proof is by induction. First we prove that g = fm + 1∈Im + 1,k. Let [formula] and

[formula]

[formula]

We want to show that

[formula]

if [formula].

First, consider [formula] and a  ≠  b. Since φm + k  ≠  m + k - 4, it follows immediately from the definition of g that

[formula]

For [formula], we want to show that

[formula]

for all a,b∈Z3 since this implies

[formula]

The condition ([\ref=con1]) is equivalent to the following.

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

and where, for technical reasons, we define

[formula]

The point is at most three of the terms Δg,i  -  Δf,i are non-zero. We look at one combination of a and b in detail as an illustration, namely a = 1 and b = 2. Then [formula] and [formula] and so Δg,i  =  Δf,i for all i  ≤  m + k + 1, except in the following three cases

[formula]

[formula]

Note that we have used the fact that γm + k  ≠  m + k - 4. We see that [formula].

The other combinations of a and b are similar. This proves that fm + 1 = g∈Im + 1,k.

Now, let h = H(g) = fm + 2. A similar analysis will show that h∈Im + 2,k. We first give a table of the last three symbols in [formula] as these three symbols are the most important in the proof. Let φs = m + k - 3. By assumption, s < m + k.

[formula]

In addition,

[formula]

Note that we have used the fact that φm + k  ≠  m + k - 3 here, since if we had φm + k  =  m + k - 3, then we would for example have had [formula]. From the table we first see that

[formula]

if a1a2  ≠  b1b2. For example [formula] and [formula] differ in positions r, s, m + k, m + k + 1 and m + k + 2. As another example, [formula] and [formula] differ in positions m + k and m + k + 1.

Next, consider [formula] for [formula]. We see that

[formula]

for i < m + k: from the table above, we can see that

[formula]

As an example, let a1a2 = 10 and b1b2 = 02. Then

[formula]

and

[formula]

The distance between the two is 2 (if φm + k  =  γm + k) or 3 (otherwise). The other combinations of a1a2 and b1b2 are similar. From this we can conclude that h∈Im + 2,k in a similar way we showed that g∈Im + 1,k above.

Further, we note that

[formula]

Therefore, we can repeat the argument and, by induction, obtain fn∈In,k for all n  ≥  m.

A function F is given by an explicit listing in the appendix. It belongs to I3,2 and satisfy [formula]. This, combined with Theorem [\ref=t2], proves Theorem [\ref=main] a).

Proof of Theorem [\ref=main], second part

To prove Theorem [\ref=main] b), using Theorem [\ref=t1], we need some f∈P9,1 such that

[formula]

An extensive computer search has been unsuccessful in coming up with such a mapping. However, an indirect approach has been successful. The approach is to construct f from two simpler mappings found by computer search.

For a vector [formula] and a set [formula], let [formula] denote the vector obtained from ρ by removing the elements with subscript in X. For example,

[formula]

By computer search we have found mappings G∈F5,2 and H∈F4,2 that satisfy the following conditions

[formula]

The mappings G and H are listed explicitly in the appendix. We will now show how these mappings can be combined to produce a mapping f∈P9,1 satisfying ([\ref=con10]).

Let [formula]. Then [formula], where [formula] and [formula]. Let

[formula]

We note that Condition d) implies that γ5  ≥  6 and γ6  ≥  6. Similarly, Conditions a) and b) imply that φ7  ≤  5.

Define [formula] as follows.

[formula]

In ρ, swap 1 and 6 and also swap 2 and 7, and let the resulting array be denoted by π. More formally,

[formula]

Then define

[formula]

We will show that f has the stated properties. We first show that π∈S10. We have φ∈S7 and γ is a permutation of (5,6,7,8,9,10). In particular, 5,6, and 7 appear both in φ and γ. The effect of the first line in the definition of ρ is to move another elements (γ5) into the position where φ has a 6. Similarly, the second line overwrites the 7 in ρ, and the fourth line overwrites the 5 in γ. The definition of ρ is then the concatenation of the six first (overwritten) elements of φ and the five first (overwritten) elements of γ. Therefore, ρ contains no duplicate elements, that is, ρ∈S10.

The element 1 in ρ must be either in one of the first six positions, coming from φ, or in one of the positions 7 - 9 (if φ7 = 1). Similarly, the element 2 must be in one of the first nine positions of ρ. Therefore, both 6 and 7 must be among the first nine elements of π, that is [formula].

Finally, we must show that f is distance preserving. Let [formula], and let the arrays corresponding to [formula] be denoted by φ', γ', ρ' and π'. By assumption,

[formula]

For 1  ≤  i  ≤  6 we have

[formula]

If φi  =  φ'i this is obvious. Otherwise, we may assume without loss of generality that φ'i  <  φi and we must show that ρi  ≠  ρ'i. If φi  ≤  5, then

[formula]

If φi = 6, then

[formula]

If φi = 7, then 4  ≤  i  ≤  6 and so φ'i  ≠  6. Hence

[formula]

This completes that proof of ([\ref=i6]). A similar arguments show that for 7  ≤  i  ≤  10 we have

[formula]

and that for 1  ≤  i  ≤  10 we have

[formula]

Combining ([\ref=ov4])-([\ref=i8]), we get

[formula]

Hence, f is distance preserving.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=main], last part

The construction of a mapping f∈P13,0 which proves Theorem [\ref=main] c) is similar to the construction in the previous section. However, the construction is more involved and contains several steps. We will describe the constructions and properties of the intermediate mappings. The details of proofs are similar to the proof in the previous section and we omit these details.

We start with three mappings R,S∈F3,2 and T∈F4,2. These were found by computer search and are listed explicitly in the appendix. They have the following properties:

[formula]

These mappings are used as building blocks similarly to what was done in the previous section.
