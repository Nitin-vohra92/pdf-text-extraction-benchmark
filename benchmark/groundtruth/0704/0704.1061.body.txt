Comment on "Chiral Suppression of Scalar Glueball Decay"

In a recent letter, based on an effective Lagrangian, Chanowitz[\cite=Chan] showed that in the limit that the mass mq of a light quark q goes to zero, the decay amplitude for a scalar glueball Gs decaying into q goes to zero, and conjectured further that this chiral suppression also occurs at the hadron level for Gs decays into ππ,KK with the ratio of these two branching ratios to be of the order O(m2u,d / m2s) for finite quark masses. Here we show that the decay Gs  →  q is forbidden in the chiral limit in QCD without assumptions. More essentially, we show that this chiral suppression may be spoiled and may not materialize itself at the hadron level.

A glueball here is assumed to be a pure gluonic state. It decays into a q pair through a multi-gluon annihilation process. The decay amplitude for Gs  →  q(p1)(p2) can be written as a product of a spinor pair ū(p1) and v(p2) with a product of any number of γ matrices sandwiched between the spinors. Because vector-like coupling in QCD, for mq = 0 the number of the γ-matrices is an odd number which can always be reduced to one γ-matrix. Therefore the amplitude can be written as:

[formula]

Lorentz covariance of the amplitude then dictates Aμ(p1,p2) to be of the form a1pμ1  +  a2pμ2. Therefore in the chiral limit mq = 0, Tq  =  0. The result also applies to a pseudoscalar glueball decays into a q pair.

To study whether there is a chiral suppression in Gs  →  ππ,KK or not, we work with an effective Lagrangian, Ls  =  fgGa,μνGa μνGs, as in [\cite=Chan], and employ QCD factorization[\cite=BrLe] to calculate the amplitude Tππ for Gs  →  π+π-. To the leading twist-2 order, there are two diagrams with the two gluons splitting into two quarks and two anti-quarks, and then form two pions. The two gluons are off-shell by the scale at order of MGs. A direct calculation gives:

[formula]

where φπ is normalized as [formula]. ui(i = 1,2) is the momentum fraction carried by the anti-quark in the meson. In the above, λ can be any soft scale, such as quark mass, ΛQCD and mπ. Clearly, Tππ is not zero in the chiral limit mq = 0.

The amplitude for Gs  →  K+K- decay can be obtained by replacing quantities related to π by those related to K correspondingly. We would obtain, R = B(Gs   →   ππ)  /  B(Gs   →   KK)  ≈  f4π  /  f4K  =  0.48, which is substantially different from 1. This suppression is much milder compared with the one at the quark level. This is due to the fact that in perturbative QCD (pQCD) calculation the decay of Gs  →  ππ,KK is related to the coupling of Gs to two pairs of q compared with conjectured by Chanowitz in [\cite=Chan], where it is assumed that Gs just couples to one q pair. We should point out that whether the chiral suppression at quark level can be realized still waits for better non-perturbative calculation for the direct two quark hadronization into ππ and KK. If the pQCD contribution dominates, the result of R  ≈  f4π  /  f4K can be obtained without the assumption of the effective Lagrangian. Because glueball is a pure gluon state, the amplitude of the decay Gs  →  π+π- can always be written with QCD factorization as [formula], where the higher-twist effects related to π's are neglected and Hg consists of some perturbative coefficient functions and some quantities related to the structure of Gs. Although Hg is unknown, one can easily find the result of R  ≈  f4π  /  f4K.

The f0(1710) is a candidate for scalar glueball. Early measurement obtained R  ≤  0.11[\cite=PDG], and a larger one by BES[\cite=bes] R = 0.41+ 0.11- 0.17 recently. It is interesting to notice that the later is consistent with our result and may favor that the f0(1710) is a gluebal. However one should remember that the prediction R  ≈  f4π  /  f4K can have substantial non-perturbative corrections and there may be further complication by mixing effects of a glueball with q states. A more detailed study can be found in [\cite=CHM].
