In the present article, we introduce a model to investigate the energy spectrum of a relativistic rotor by considering the Klein-Gordon Hamiltonian. Rotational spectral lines are a signature of homonuclear and heteronuclear systems and play a key role in understanding diatomic molecules. We show that the energy-correction term arising due to unequal masses influences the line separation. Determining the rotational constant enables one to calculate the moment of inertia and bond length of the molecule.

Introduction

The rigid rotator is a well-known problem in classical mechanics1 as also in quantum mechanics.The quantum theory of the band spectra of diatomic molecules began with the quantisation of angular momentum of the rigid rotator. Much of spectroscopic calculation relies on rigid rotator models. It is well-known that there exists a fundamental difference between atomic spectra and molecular spectra. While for atoms the line separation in a series decreases rapidly, for molecular spectra in the infrared, it is approximately a constant. Actually, for linear diatomic molecules, two additional modes of motion, namely rotation and vibration, not present in atoms, are possible. In literature, the energy spectrum of such a system is investigated non-relativistically. Presently, we propose to view the model in the relativistic framework.

After the classic application of relativistic wave equations to the atomic spectrum of hydrogen atom, there were several other applications of the relativistic wave equations to well-known problems of non-relativistic quantum mechanics. In the simplest from, one can cite the work of Sauter2, who treated the problem of a particle in an uniform field relativistically. Srinivasa Rao et.al.3, have dealt with the relativistic rigid rotator in an elegant way, treating the rotor as a dumb bell with equal masses. Following the prescription of Rao, we extend the treatment to a linear rotator with unequal masses. The foregoing discussion is applicable to any heteronuclear system, special case of which is the homonuclear species. Such studies, apart from being pedagogical in nature are potentially exciting and shed light on the spectra of diatomic molecules.

Klein-Gordon Rotor

In the simplest model of a rotator, we consider two atoms of masses m1 and m2 separated by distance r.

The Klein-Gordon Hamiltonian for a system of two non-interacting particles may be written as

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] refer to the momenta of the two particles.

Introducing the centre of mass co-ordinate [formula] and the relative co-ordinate [formula], the two body problem may be reduced to an equivalent one-body problem. The relative co-ordinate, [formula] is expressed as

[formula]

and the centre of mass co-ordinate [formula] is given by

[formula]

It is straightforward to verify the following relations

[formula]

[formula]

where M = m1 + m2 is implied.

The eigenvalue equation, Hψ = Wψ may be written as

[formula]

using [formula] and [formula] in Eqn.(1). Operating on the left by (H + W), we obtain,

[formula]

with    [formula]

and     [formula]

To eliminate the square root operators in H1, we operate on the left of Eqn.(7) by (W1 - H1) and obtain

[formula]

The operator equation of the above is

[formula]

The above equation simplifies to
