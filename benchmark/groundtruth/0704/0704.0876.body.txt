Non-monotone convergence in the quadratic Wasserstein distance

We use the terminology and notation from [\cite=vil:03]. For Borel measures μ, ν on [formula] we define the quadratic Wasserstein distance

[formula]

where [formula] is the Euclidean distance on [formula] and the pairs (X,Y) run through all random vectors defined on some common probabilistic space [formula], such that X has distribution μ and Y has distribution ν. By a slight abuse of notation we define T(U,V): = T(μ,ν) for two random vectors U, [formula], such that U has distribution μ and V has distribution ν. The following theorem (see [\cite=vil:03]) is due to Tanaka [\cite=tan:73].

For [formula] and square integrable random vectors X, Y, X', Y' such that X is independent of Y, and X' is independent of Y', and [formula] or [formula], we have

[formula]

For a sequence of i.i.d. random vectors [formula] we define the normalized partial sums

[formula]

If μ denotes the law of X1, we write μ(m) for the law of Sm. Clearly μ(m) equals, up to the scaling factor [formula], the m-fold convolution [formula] of μ.

We shall always deal with measures μ, ν with vanishing barycenter. Given two measures μ and ν on [formula] with finite second moments, we let [formula] and [formula] be i.i.d. sequences with law μ and ν, respectively, and denote by Sm and [formula] the corresponding normalized partial sums. From Theorem [\ref=th1] we obtain

[formula]

from which one may quickly deduce a proof of the Central Limit Theorem (compare [\cite=vil:03] and the references given there).

However, we can not deduce from Theorem [\ref=th1] that the inequality

[formula]

holds true for all [formula]. Specializing to the case m = 2, an estimate, which we can obtain from Tanaka's Theorem, is

[formula]

This contains some valid information, but does not imply [\eqref=J3]. It was posed as Problem 7.20 of [\cite=vil:03], whether inequality [\eqref=J3] holds true for all probability measures μ, ν on [formula] and all [formula].

The subsequent easy example shows that the answer is no, even for d = 1 and symmetric measures. We can choose μ  =  μn and ν  =  νn for sufficiently large [formula], as the proposition (see also Remark [\ref=counter-example_Remark]) shows.

Denote by μn the distribution of [formula], and by νn the distribution of [formula] with [formula] i.i.d. and [formula]. Then

[formula]

while [formula] for all [formula].

If one only wants to find a counter-example to Problem 7.20 of [\cite=vil:03], one does not really need the full strength of Proposition [\ref=Main_Prop], i.e. the estimate that [formula]. In fact, it is sufficient to consider the case n = 2 in order to contradict the monotonicity of inequality [\eqref=J3]. Indeed, a direct calculation reveals that

We start with the final assertion, which is easy to show. The 3-fold convolutions of the measures μn and νn, respectively, are supported on odd and even numbers, respectively. Hence they have disjoint supports with distance 1 and so the quadratic transportation costs are bounded from below by 1.

For the proof of [\eqref=J4], fix [formula], define [formula] and [formula], and note that σn and τn are supported by the even numbers. For [formula] we denote by pn,k the probability of the point 2k under σn, i.e.

[formula]

We define pn,k = 0 for |k|  ≥  2n. We have [formula], where ρ is the distribution giving probability [formula], [formula], [formula] to - 2, 0, 2, respectively. We deduce that for [formula],

[formula]

Notice that pn,k  ≥  pn,k + 1 for [formula]. The term in the first parentheses is therefore non-negative. It can easily be calculated and estimated via for [formula].

Following [\cite=vil:03] we know that the quadratic Wasserstein distance T can be given by a cyclically monotone transport plan π  =  πn. We define the transport plan π via an intuitive transport map T. It is sufficient to define T for [formula], since it acts symmetrically on the negative side. T moves mass [formula] from the point 2k to 2k + 2 for [formula]. At k = 0 the transport T moves [formula] to every side, which is possible, since there is enough mass concentrated at 0.

By equation [\eqref=netto_equation] we see that the transport T moves σn to τn, since, for 1  ≤  k  ≤  2n - 2, the first terms corresponds to the mass, which arrives from the left and is added to σn, and the second term to the mass, which is transported away: summing up one obtains τn. For k = 2n - 1, mass only arrives from the left. At k  =  0 mass is only transported away. By the symmetry of the problem around 0 and by the quadratic nature of the cost function (the distance of the transport is 2, hence cost 22), we finally have By the Central Limit Theorem and uniform integrability of the function x  ↦  x+: =  max (0,x) with respect to the binomial approximations, we obtain

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

In order to obtain equality we start from the local monotonicity of the respective transport maps on non-positive and non-negative numbers. It easily follows that the given transport plan is cyclically monotone and hence optimal (see [\cite=vil:03]). The subsequent equality allows also to consider estimates from below. Rewriting [\eqref=netto_equation] yields

[formula]

for 0  ≤  k  ≤  2n - 3, and

[formula]

for k = 2n - 2. Furthermore, for [formula]. This yields by a reasoning similar to the above that

[formula]

hence

Let [formula] be an integer. By slight modifications of the proof of Proposition [\ref=Main_Prop] we can construct sequences of measures [formula] and [formula], such that the quadratic Wasserstein distances of k-fold convolutions are bounded from below by 1 for all k which are not multiples of p, while

[formula]

Assume the notations of [\cite=vil:03]. In the previous considerations we can replace the quadratic cost function by any other lower semi-continuous cost function [formula], which is bounded on parallels to the diagonal and vanishes on the diagonal. For example, if we choose c(x,y) = |x  -  y|r for 0 < r <   ∞  , then we obtain the same asymptotics as in Proposition [\ref=Main_Prop] (with a different constant).

We have used in the above proof that τn is obtained from σn by convolving with the measure ρ. In fact, this theme goes back (at least) as far as L. Bachelier's famous thesis from 1900 on option pricing [\cite=bac:00]. Strictly speaking, L. Bachelier deals with the measure assigning mass [formula] to - 1, 1 and considers consecutive convolutions, instead of the above ρ. Hence convolutions with ρ correspond to Bachelier's result after two time steps. Bachelier makes the crucial observation that this convolution leads to a radiation of probabilities: Each stock price x radiates during a time unit to its neighboring price a quantity of probability proportional to the difference of their probabilities. This was essentially the argument which allowed us to prove [\eqref=J3]. Let us mention that Bachelier uses this argument to derive the fundamental relation between Brownian motion (which he was the first to define and analyse in his thesis) and the heat equation (compare e.g. [\cite=sch:03] for more on this topic).

Having established the above counterexample, it becomes clear how to modify Problem 7.20 from [\cite=vil:03] to give it a chance to hold true. This possible modification was also pointed out to us by C. Villani.

Let μ be a probability measure on [formula] with finite second moment and vanishing barycenter, and γ the Gaussian measure with same first and second moments. Does [formula] decrease monotonically to zero?

When entropy is considered instead of the quadratic Wasserstein distance the corresponding question on monotonicity was answered affirmatively in the recent paper [\cite=artbalbarnao:04].

One may also formulate a variant of Problem 7.20 as given in ([\ref=J3]) by replacing the measure ν through a log-concave probability distribution. This would again generalize problem 1.
