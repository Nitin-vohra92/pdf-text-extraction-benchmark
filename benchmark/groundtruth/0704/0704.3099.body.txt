Elliptic hypergeometric functions

Introduction. The wonderful book by Andrews, Askey, and Roy [\cite=aar] is mainly devoted to special functions of hypergeometric type - to the plain and q-hypergeometric series and integrals. Shortly before its publication, examples of a third type of such functions, related to elliptic curves, began to appear. A systematic theory of elliptic hypergeometric functions was constructed in 2000-2004 over a short period of time. The present complement reviews briefly the status of this theory to the end of 2006. It repeats where possible the structure of the complemented book [\cite=aar], and it is based mainly on the material [\cite=spi:thesis].

The theory of quantum and classical completely integrable systems played a crucial role in the discovery of these new special functions. An elliptic extension of the terminating very well poised balanced q-hypergeometric series 10φ9 with discrete values of parameters appeared for the first time in elliptic solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation [\cite=ft] associated with the exactly solvable models of statistical mechanics [\cite=djkmo]. The same terminating series with arbitrary parameters appeared in [\cite=spi-zhe:spectral] as a particular solution of a pair of linear finite difference equations, the compatibility condition of which yields the most general known (1 + 1)-dimensional nonlinear integrable chain analogous to the discrete time Toda chain. In [\cite=rui:first], the generalized gamma functions were investigated in detail, including one of the elliptic analogues of Euler's gamma function, which appeared implicitly already in Baxter's eight vertex model. The appearance of such mathematical objects was quite unexpected, since no handbook or textbook of special functions contained any hint of their existence. Some relatives of these functions were considered only in the old original papers by Barnes [\cite=bar:multiple] and Jackson [\cite=jac:basic].

Generalized gamma functions. In the beginning of the XX-th century Barnes [\cite=bar:multiple] suggested a multiple zeta function depending on m quasiperiods [formula]:

[formula]

where the series converges for [formula] and under the condition that if [formula], then ωj  /  ωk > 0. Using an integral representation for ζm, Barnes also defined the multiple gamma function [formula] which has the infinite product representation

[formula]

where γmk are some constants analogous to Euler's constant (in [\cite=bar:multiple], the normalization γm0 = 0 was used). The primed product means that the point [formula] is excluded from it. The function [formula] satisfies m finite difference equations of the first order

[formula]

where [formula] and Γ0(u;ω): = 1 / u. The function Γ1(ω1x;ω1) essentially coincides with Euler's gamma function Γ(x). The plain, q-, and elliptic hypergeometric functions are respectively connected to [formula] for m = 1,2,3.

We define three base variables [formula] related to the pairwise incommensurate quasiperiods ω1,2,3 as follows:

[formula]

where ,p̃, denote the modular transformed bases. For |p|,|q| < 1, the infinite products

[formula]

are well defined. It is easy to derive equalities [\cite=jac:basic]

[formula]

The odd Jacobi theta function (see formula (10.7.1) in [\cite=aar]) can be written as

[formula]

where p = e2πiτ. The shortened theta function (see Theorem 10.4.1 in [\cite=aar])

[formula]

plays a crucial role in the following. It obeys the following properties:

[formula]

and θ(z;p) = 0 for [formula] We denote

[formula]

Then the Riemann identity for products of four theta functions takes the form

[formula]

(the ratio of the left- and right-hand sides is a bounded function of [formula], and it does not depend on x due to the Liouville theorem, but for x = w the equality is evident).

Euler's gamma function can be defined as a special meromorphic solution of the functional equation f(u + ω1) = uf(u). q-Gamma functions are connected to solutions of the equation f(u + ω1) = (1 - e2πiu / ω2)f(u) with q = e2πiω1  /  ω2. For |q| < 1, one of its solutions has the form Γq(u) = 1 / (e2πiu / ω2;q)∞ defining the standard q-gamma function (it differs from function (10.3.3) in [\cite=aar] by the substitution u = ω1x and some elementary multiplier). The modified q-gamma function ("the double sine", "hyperbolic gamma function", etc), which remains well defined even for |q| = 1, has the form

[formula]

where the contour [formula] coincides with the real axis deformed to pass clockwise the point x = 0 in an infinitesimal way. If [formula], then the integral converges for [formula]. Under appropriate restrictions upon u and ω1,2, the integral can be computed as a convergent sum of the residues of poles in the upper half plane. When [formula], this yields the expression [formula], which can be extended analytically to the whole complex u-plane. This function, serving as a key building block of the q-hypergeometric functions for |q| = 1, was not considered in [\cite=aar] and [\cite=gas-rah:basic]; for its detailed description see [\cite=jm] [\cite=kls:unitary] [\cite=rui:first] [\cite=volk] and the literature cited therein.

In an analogous way, elliptic gamma functions are connected to the equation

[formula]

Using the factorization [\eqref=short-theta] and equalities [\eqref=eq-1], it is not difficult to see that the ratio

[formula]

satisfies the equations

[formula]

Therefore the function f(u) = Γ(e2πiu / ω2;p,q) defines a solution of equation [\eqref=e-gamma-eq] valid for |q|,|p| < 1, which is called the (standard) elliptic gamma function [\cite=rui:first]. It can be defined uniquely as a meromorphic solution of three equations: [\eqref=e-gamma-eq] and

[formula]

with the normalization [formula], since there do not exist non-trivial triply periodic functions. The reflection formula for it has the form Γ(z;p,q) Γ(pq / z;p,q) = 1. For p = 0, we have Γ(z;0,q) = 1 / (z;q)∞.

The modified elliptic gamma function, which is well defined for |q| = 1, has the form [\cite=spi:theta2]

[formula]

It yields the unique solution of three equations: [\eqref=e-gamma-eq] and

[formula]

with the normalization [formula]. Here

[formula]

denotes the second Bernoulli polynomial appearing in the modular transformation law for the theta function

[formula]

One can check [\cite=die-spi:unit] that the same three equations and normalization are satisfied by the function

[formula]

where |p̃|,|| < 1, and the polynomial of the third degree P(u) has the form

[formula]

Functions [\eqref=unit-e-gamma] and [\eqref=mod-e-gamma] therefore coincide, and their equality defines one of the laws of the [formula]-group of modular transformations for the elliptic gamma function [\cite=fel-var:elliptic]. From expression [\eqref=mod-e-gamma], the function [formula] is easily seen to remain meromorphic when ω1  /  ω2 > 0, i.e. |q| = 1. The reflection formula for this function has the form G(a;ω)G(b;ω) = 1, [formula] In the regime |q| < 1 and [formula] (i.e., Im(ω3  /  ω1), Im(ω3  /  ω2)  →    +    ∞  ), expression [\eqref=unit-e-gamma] obviously degenerates to the modified q-gamma function γ(u;ω). Representation [\eqref=mod-e-gamma] yields an alternative way of reduction to γ(u;ω); a rigorous limiting connection of such a type was built for the first time in a different way by Ruijsenaars [\cite=rui:first].

As shown by Barnes, the q-gamma function 1 / (z;q)∞ with z = e2πiu / ω2 and q = e2πiω1  /  ω2, [formula], equals in essence to the product Γ2(u;ω1,ω2)Γ2(u - ω2;ω1, - ω2). Analogously, the modified q-gamma function [formula] coincides in essence with the ratio [formula]. Since θ(z;q) = (z;q)∞(qz- 1;q)∞, the [formula]-function represents "a quarter" of the θ1(u / ω2|ω1  /  ω2) Jacobi theta function (in the sense of the number of divisor points). Correspondingly, one can consider equation [\eqref=e-gamma-eq] as a composition of four equations for [formula] with different arguments and quasiperiods and represent the elliptic gamma functions as ratios of four Barnes gamma functions of the third order with some simple exponential multipliers [\cite=FR] [\cite=spi:theta2]. For some other important results for the generalized gamma functions, see [\cite=nar] [\cite=rai:limits].

The elliptic beta integral. It is convenient to use the compact notation

[formula]

for working with elliptic hypergeometric integrals. We start consideration from the elliptic beta integral discovered by the author in [\cite=spi:umn].

We take eight complex parameters [formula], and p,q, satisfying the constraints |p|,|q|,|tj| < 1 and [formula]. Then the following equality is valid

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the positively oriented unit circle and κ = (p;p)∞(q;q)∞ / 4πi.

The first proof of this formula was based on the elliptic extension of Askey's method [\cite=ask:beta]. A rather short proof was given in [\cite=spi:short], but still it does not fit the margins of this page and we skip it. The elliptic beta integral [\eqref=ell-int] defines the most general known univariate exact integration formula generalizing Euler's beta integral. For p  →  0, one obtains the Rahman integral [\cite=rah:integral] (see Theorem 10.8.2 in [\cite=aar]), which goes to the well known Askey-Wilson q-beta integral [\cite=aw] (see Theorem 10.8.1 in [\cite=aar]), if one of the parameters vanishes.

We replace [formula] by a contour C which separates sequences of poles converging to zero along the points [formula], from their reciprocals obtained by the change z  →  1 / z, which diverge to infinity. This allows us to lift the constraints |tj| < 1 without changing the right-hand side of [\eqref=ell-int]. We substitute t6 = pq / A, [formula], and suppose that [formula] |pt5| < 1 < |t5|, |pq| < |A|, and that the arguments of [formula] and p,q are linearly independent over [formula]. Then the following equality takes place [\cite=die-spi:elliptic]:

[formula]

where [formula] and

[formula]

We have introduced here the new parameter t0 with the help of the relation [formula] = q and used the elliptic Pochhammer symbol

[formula]

(the indicated ratio of elliptic gamma functions defines θ(t)n for arbitrary [formula]). The multiplier κ is absent in the coefficient c0 due to the relation lim z  →  1(1 - z)Γ(z;p,q) = 1 / (p;p)∞(q;q)∞ and doubling of the number of residues because of the symmetry z  →  z- 1.

In the limit [formula], the integral value in the left-hand side of [\eqref=res], i.e. the right-hand side of [\eqref=ell-int], and the multiplier c0() in front of the sum of residues on the right-hand side diverge, whereas the integral over the unit circle [formula] remains finite. After dividing all the terms by c0() and going to the limiting relation, we obtain the Frenkel-Turaev summation formula

[formula]

which was established for the first time in [\cite=ft] by a completely different method. For p  →  0 and fixed parameters, equality [\eqref=ft-sum] reduces to the Jackson sum for a terminating 8φ7-series (see formula (12.3.5) in [\cite=aar]).

General elliptic hypergeometric functions. Definitions of the general elliptic hypergeometric series and integrals were respectively given and investigated in detail in [\cite=spi:theta1] and [\cite=spi:theta2]. So, formal series [formula] are called the elliptic hypergeometric series, if cn + 1 = h(n)cn, where h(n) is some elliptic function of [formula]. It is well known [\cite=akh], that an arbitrary elliptic function h(u) of order s + 1 with the periods ω2  /  ω1 and ω3  /  ω1 can be represented in the form

[formula]

where z = qu. The equality h(u + ω2  /  ω1) = h(u) is evident, and the periodicity h(u + ω3  /  ω1) = h(u) brings in the balancing condition [formula] Because of the factorization of h(n), in order to determine the coefficients cn it suffices to solve the equation an + 1  =  θ(tqn;p)  an, which leads to the elliptic Pochhammer symbol an  =  θ(t)n  a0. The explicit form of the bilateral elliptic hypergeometric series is now easily found to be

[formula]

where we have chosen the normalization c0 = 1. By setting [formula], we obtain the one sided series

[formula]

For fixed tj and wj, the function [formula] degenerates in the limit p  →  0 to the basic q-hypergeometric series [formula] with the condition [formula]. There are some problems with the convergence of infinite series [\eqref=E-series], and therefore we assume that they terminate due to the condition tk = q- NpM for some k and [formula] For consideration of some questions, the additive system of notation for the elliptic hypergeometric series is more convenient (see, e.g., Ch. 11 in [\cite=gas-rah:basic] or [\cite=spi:thesis]), but we skip it here.

Series [\eqref=E-series] is called well poised, if [formula]. In this case the balancing condition takes the form [formula], and the functions h(u) and s + 1Es become invariant under the changes [formula] and t0  →  p2t0. For odd s and the balancing condition of the form [formula], there appears the symmetry t0  →  pt0 and s + 1Es becomes an elliptic function of all free parameters [formula] with equal periods (such functions were called in [\cite=spi:theta1] [\cite=spi:thesis] the totally elliptic functions). Under the four additional constraints [formula], connected with the doubling of the argument of theta functions, the series are called very well poised. In [\cite=spi:bailey1], a special notation was introduced for the very well poised elliptic hypergeometric series:

[formula]

where the balancing condition has the form [formula], and for odd s we assume the positive sign choice for preserving the symmetry t0  →  pt0. For the y argument value y = 1, it is omitted in the series notation. Summation formula [\eqref=ft-sum] thus gives a closed form expression for the terminating [formula]-series.

Contour integrals [formula] are called the elliptic hypergeometric integrals, if the function Δ(u) satisfies the system of three equations

[formula]

where [formula] are some pairwise incommensurate parameters and hk(u) - some elliptic functions with periods ωk, ωk + 1 (we set ωk + 3  =  ωk). One can weaken requirement [\eqref=ell-gip] by leaving only one equation, but then there appears a functional freedom in the choice of Δ(u), which should be fixed in some other way.

Omitting the details of consideration [\cite=spi:theta2] [\cite=spi:thesis], we present the general form of permissible Δ(u). We suppose that this function satisfies equations [\eqref=ell-gip] for k = 1,2, where

[formula]

with |p|,|r| < 1 and [formula], [formula]. If we take |q| < 1, then the most general meromorphic function Δ(u) has the form

[formula]

where the parameters d and m are arbitrary, and ak,bk,c are connected with y1 and y2 by the relations y2 = ecω2 and [formula]. It appears that the function h3(u) cannot be arbitrary - it is determined from expression [\eqref=delta-ell].

For |q| = 1, it is necessary in [\eqref=delta-ell] to choose [formula] and to fix parameters in such a way that the Γ-functions are combined to the modified elliptic gamma function [formula] (it is precisely in this way that this function was built in [\cite=spi:theta2]):

[formula]

where the parameters gj,  vj are connected with tj,  wj by the relations tj = e2πigj  /  ω2, wj = e2πivj  /  ω2, and y1,2 = ecω1,2. The integrals [formula] with kernels of the indicated form define elliptic analogues of the Meijer function. A more general theta hypergeometric analogue of the Meijer function was constructed in [\cite=spi:theta2], but we skip it here.

We limit consideration to the choice [formula] in [\eqref=delta-ell]. The corresponding integrals are called well poised, if [formula]. The additional condition of very well poisedness fixes eight parameters [formula] ts  =  {  ±  (pq)1 / 2, ±  q1 / 2p, ±  p1 / 2q,  ±  pq} and doubles the argument of the elliptic gamma function: [formula] The most interesting are the very well poised elliptic hypergeometric integrals with even number of parameters

[formula]

with |tj| < 1 and the "correct" choice of the sign in the balancing condition. They represent integral analogues of the s + 1Vs-series with odd s, "correct" balancing condition and the argument y = 1, in the sense that these series appear as residue sums of particular pole sequences of the kernel of I(m). We note that I(0) coincides with the elliptic beta integral.

Properties of the elliptic functions explain the origins of the old hypergeometric notions of balancing, well poisedness, and very well poisedness. However, strictly speaking these notions are consistently defined only at the elliptic level, because there are limits to such q-hypergeometric identities in which they are not conserved any more [\cite=rai:abelian] [\cite=spi:bailey1]! The fact of unique determination of the balancing condition for series [\eqref=V-series] with odd s and integrals [\eqref=gen-int] (precisely these objects emerge in the main part of interesting applications) illustrates a deep internal tie between the "elliptic" and "hypergeometric" classes of special functions. Multivariable elliptic hypergeometric series and integrals are defined analogously to the univariate case - it is necessary to use systems of finite difference equations for kernels with the coefficients which are elliptic functions of all summation or integration variables [\cite=spi:theta1] [\cite=spi:theta2], which is a natural generalization of the approach of Pochhammer and Horn to the functions of hypergeometric type [\cite=aar] [\cite=ggr].

An elliptic analogue of the Gauss hypergeometric function. We take eight parameters [formula] and two base variables [formula] satisfying the constraints |p|,|q| < 1 and [formula] (the balancing condition). For [formula] an elliptic analogue of the Gauss hypergeometric function 2F1(a,b;c;x) is defined by the integral representation [\cite=spi:thesis]

[formula]

i.e. by the choice m = 1 in expression [\eqref=gen-int]. For other admissible values of parameters, the V-function is defined by the analytical continuation of expression [\eqref=ehf]. From this continuation one can see that the V-function is meromorphic in all parameters for arbitrary [formula] - it is sufficient for this to compute residues of the integrand and to define analytically continued function as a sum of the integral over some fixed contour and residues of the poles crossing this contour. For a more detailed analysis of the meromorphic character of the elliptic hypergeometric integrals and an interesting role of the "correct" sign choice in the balancing condition played in that, see [\cite=rai:trans].

The first nontrivial property of function [\eqref=ehf] consists in its reduction to the elliptic beta integral under the condition tjtk = pq for an arbitrary pair of parameters tj and tk (expression [\eqref=ell-int] appears from t7t8 = pq). The V-function is evidently symmetric in p and q. It is invariant also under the S8-group of permutations of parameters tj isomorphic to the A7 Weyl group. We consider the double integral

[formula]

where [formula], |aj|,|bj|,|c| < 1, and [formula] Using formula [\eqref=ell-int] for integrations over z or w (the permutation of the order of integrations is permitted), we obtain the following transformation formula:

[formula]

where we used the compact notation [formula],

[formula]

and |tj|,|sj| < 1. This fundamentally important relation was obtained by the author in [\cite=spi:theta2], where the function V() appeared for the first time. It represents an elliptic analogue (moreover, its integral generalization) of the Bailey transformation for four non terminating 10φ9-series [\cite=gas-rah:basic].

We repeat transformation [\eqref=E7-1] once more with the parameters s3,4,5,6, playing the role of t1,2,3,4, and permute parameters t3,t4 with t5,t6 in the result. This yields the relation

[formula]

where T = t1t2t3t4, U = t5t6t7t8 and |T|1 / 2 < |tj| < 1, |U|1 / 2 < |tj + 4| < 1,  j = 1,2,3,4. We equate now the right-hand sides of relations [\eqref=E7-1] and [\eqref=E7-2], express parameters tj in terms of sj and obtain the third relation

[formula]

where |pq|1 / 2 < |sj| < 1 for all j.

We consider Euclidean space [formula] with the scalar product 〈x,y〉 and an orthonormal basis [formula], 〈ei,ej〉  =  δij. The root system A7 consists of the vectors v = {ei - ej,  i  ≠  j}. Its Weyl group is composed from the reflections x  →  Sv(x) = x - 2v〈v,x〉  /  〈v,v〉 acting in the hyperplane orthogonal to the vector [formula] (i.e., the coordinates of the vectors [formula] satisfy the constraint [formula]), and it coincides with the permutation group S8.

We connect parameters of the V()-function with the coordinates xj by the relations tj = e2πixj(pq)1 / 4. Then the balancing condition assumes that [formula]. The first coordinate transformation [\eqref=E7-1] is now easily seen to correspond to the reflection Sv(x) for the vector [formula] having the canonical length 〈v,v〉 = 2. This reflection extends the group A7 to the exceptional Weyl group E7. Relations [\eqref=E7-2] and [\eqref=E7-3] were proved in a different way by Rains in [\cite=rai:trans], where it was indicated that these transformations belong to the group E7.

We denote by V(qtj,q- 1tk) elliptic hypergeometric functions contiguous to V() in the sense that tj and tk are respectively replaced by qtj and q- 1tk. The following contiguous relation for the V-functions is valid

[formula]

where (t6  ↔  t7) denotes the permutation of parameters in the preceding expression (such a relation was used already in [\cite=spi:umn]). Indeed, for y = t6,w = t7, and x = q- 1t8 the Riemann identity [\eqref=ident] is equivalent to the q-difference equation for V-function's integrand [formula] coinciding with [\eqref=con_1] after replacement of V-functions by Δ(z,) with appropriate parameters. Integration of this equation over the contour [formula] yields [\eqref=con_1]. We now substitute symmetry transformation [\eqref=E7-3] in [\eqref=con_1] and obtain the second contiguous relation

[formula]

An appropriate combination of these two equalities yields the equation

[formula]

where we have denoted U() = V() / Γ(t6t±8,t7t±8;p,q) and

[formula]

Substituting tj = e2πigj  /  ω2, one can check that the potential A() is a modular invariant elliptic function of the variables [formula], i.e. it does not change after the replacements gj  →  gj  +  ω2,3 and (ω2,ω3)  →  ( - ω3,ω2).

We introduce now the new notation for parameters: t6 = cx,t7 = c / x, and

[formula]

Setting [formula], we find that the balancing condition in terms of εk takes the form [formula]. After the replacement of U() in [\eqref=pre-ehf] by some unknown function f(x), we obtain a q-difference equation of the second order which is called the elliptic hypergeometric equation:

[formula]

We have already one functional solution of this equation

[formula]

where, for the choice [formula] of the integration contour in the definition of the V-function, it is necessary to impose the constraints (in the previous parametrization) [formula] and [formula], which can be relaxed by analytical continuation. Other independent solutions can be obtained by the multiplication of one of the parameters [formula], and x by some powers of p or by permutations of [formula] with ε6.

We denote εk = e2πiak  /  ω2, x = e2πiu / ω2, and f1(x) = :F1(u;;ω1,ω2,ω3). After these changes one can check that equation [\eqref=eheq] is invariant with respect to the modular transformation (ω2,ω3)  →  ( - ω3,ω2). One of the linear independent solutions of [\eqref=eheq] therefore has the form F2(u;;ω1,ω2,ω3): = F1(u;;ω1, - ω3,ω2). The same solution would be obtained if we repeat the derivation of equation [\eqref=eheq] and its solution [\eqref=sol1] after replacing the Γ-functions by the modified elliptic gamma function [formula]. The F2-function is therefore well defined even for |q| = 1. Different limiting transitions from the V-function and other elliptic hypergeometric integrals to q-hypergeometric integrals of the Mellin-Barnes or Euler type are described in [\cite=spi:thesis] [\cite=spi:cs] and much more systematically in [\cite=brs] [\cite=rai:limits].

Biorthogonal functions of the hypergeometric type. In analogy with the residue calculus for the elliptic beta integral [\eqref=res], one can consider the sum of residues for a particular geometric progression of poles of the V-function kernel for one of the parameters. This leads to the very well poised [formula]-elliptic hypergeometric series the termination condition of which is guaranteed by a special discretization of the chosen parameter. In this way one can derive contiguous relations for the terminating [formula]-series [\cite=spi-zhe:spectral] [\cite=spi-zhe:rims] out of the contiguous relations for the V-function, which we omit due to the lack of space. For instance, this yields the following particular solution of the elliptic hypergeometric equation [\eqref=eheq]:

[formula]

valid under the condition pq / ε4ε8 = q- n, [formula] (we remind that [formula]). We describe below properties of the Rn-function found in [\cite=spi:theta2] in the notation passing to our after the replacements t0,1,2  →  ε1,2,3,  t3  →  ε6,  t4  →  ε8,  μ  →  ε4ε8 / pq, and Aμ / qt4  →  pq / ε5ε8.

Equation [\eqref=eheq] is symmetric in [formula]. Since series [\eqref=V-series] are elliptic in all parameters, function [\eqref=R_n] is symmetric in [formula] and each of them can be used for the termination of series. A permutation of ε1,ε2,ε3,ε5 with ε6 yields Rn(z;q,p) up to some multiplier independent on x due to an elliptic analogue of the Bailey transformation for terminating [formula]-series [\cite=ft], which can be obtained by degeneration from equality [\eqref=E7-1].

The same contiguous relations for the 12V11-series yield the following three term recurrence relation for Rn(x;q,p) in the index n:

[formula]

where A = ε1ε2ε3ε6ε8, and ξ and η are arbitrary gauge parameters, [formula]. The initial conditions R- 1 = 0 and R0 = 1 guarantee that all the dependence on the variable x enters only through z(x), and that Rn(x) is a rational function of z(x) with poles at the points [formula].

The elliptic hypergeometric equation for the Rn-function can be rewritten in the form of a generalized eigenvalue problem D1Rn  =  λnD2Rn for some q-difference operators of the second order D1,2 and discrete spectrum λn [\cite=spi:theta2]. We denote by φλ solutions of an abstract spectral problem D1φλ  =  λD2φλ, and by ψλ solutions of the equation DT1ψλ  =  λDT2ψλ, where DT1,2 are the operators conjugated with respect to some inner product 〈ψ|φ〉, i.e. 〈DT1,2ψ|φ〉  =  〈ψ|D1,2φ〉. Then 0 = 〈ψμ|(D1  -  λD2)φλ〉 = (μ  -  λ)〈DT2ψμ|φλ〉, i.e. the function DT2ψμ is orthogonal to φλ for μ  ≠  λ. This simple observation was put by Zhedanov into the basis of the theory of biorthogonal rational functions generalizing orthogonal polynomials [\cite=zhe:gevp] (see also [\cite=spi-zhe:spectral] [\cite=spi-zhe:rims]). Analogues of the functions DT2ψμ for Rn(z;q,p) have the form

[formula]

which are rational functions of z(x) with poles at the points [formula].

We denote [formula] and [formula], where all the 12V11-series terminate simultaneously because of the modified termination condition [formula]. The functions Rnm solve now not one but two generalized eigenvalue problems which differ from each other by the permutation of p and q.

The following two-index biorthogonality relation is valid:

[formula]

where S = {1,2,3,6,8}, Cmn,kl denotes the contour separating sequences of points [formula] from their x  →  x- 1 reciprocals, and the normalization constants have the form

[formula]

This theorem was proved in [\cite=spi:theta2] by direct computation of the integral in the left-hand side with the help of formula [\eqref=ell-int]. Appearance of the two-index orthogonality relations for functions of one variable is a new phenomenon in the theory of special functions. It should be remarked that only for k = l = 0 there exists the limit p  →  0 and functions Rn(x;q,0), Tn(x;q,0), appearing from that, coincide with Rahman's family of continuous [formula]-biorthogonal rational functions [\cite=rah:integral]. A special limit [formula] in the modular transformed Rnm and Tnm leads to the two-index biorthogonal functions which are expressed as products of two modular conjugated 10φ9-series [\cite=spi:thesis]. A special restriction for one of the parameters in Rn(x;q,p) and Tn(x;q,p) leads to the biorthognal rational functions of a discrete argument [\cite=spi-zhe:spectral] generalizing Wilson's functions [\cite=wil:orthogonal]. All these functions are natural generalizations of the Askey-Wilson polynomials [\cite=aw]. Note that Rnm(x) and Tnm(x) are meromorphic functions of [formula] with essential singularities at x = 0,  ∞   and only for k = l = 0 or n = m = 0 do they become rational functions of some argument depending on x. It is expected that there are more general systems of biorthogonal functions based on the V-function and connected to solutions of the generalized eigenvalue problem with continuous spectrum or recurrence relation [\eqref=ttr] with the shifted index n.

Elliptic beta integrals on root systems. We introduce an analogue of the constant κ for the Cn (or BCn) root system κn = (p;p)n∞(q;q)n∞ / (2πi)n2nn! and describe a Cn-elliptic beta integral representing a multiparameter generalization of integral [\eqref=ell-int].

We take n variables [formula] and complex parameters [formula] t2n + 4 and p,q satisfying the constraints |p|,|q|,|tj| < 1 and [formula]. Then

[formula]

Formula [\eqref=C-typeI] was suggested and partially confirmed in [\cite=die-spi:selberg], and it was proved by different methods in [\cite=rai:trans] [\cite=spi:short] [\cite=spi:thesis]. It reduces to one of Gustafson's integration formulas [\cite=gus:some] in a special p  →  0 limit.

We take complex parameters [formula] and q restricted by the conditions |p|,|q|, |t|, |tm| < 1, and [formula]. Then

[formula]

In order to prove [\eqref=SintB], we consider the following (2n - 1)-tuple integral

[formula]

with p,q,t and tr, [formula] lying inside the unit circle such that [formula]. We denote the integral in the left-hand side of [\eqref=SintB] as [formula]. Integration over the w-variables with the help of formula [\eqref=C-typeI] brings expression [\eqref=compint] to the form Γn(t)Γ- 1(tn) [formula] where we have introduced the parameter t6 via the relation [formula]. Because the integrand is bounded on the integration contour, we can change the order of integrations. As a result, integration over the z-variables with the help of formula [\eqref=C-typeI] brings expression [\eqref=compint] to the form [formula] [formula] i.e. we obtain the following recurrence relation in the dimensionality of the integral of interest n:

[formula]

Iterating it with known initial condition [\eqref=ell-int] for n = 1, we obtain [\eqref=SintB].

Integral [\eqref=SintB] was suggested by van Diejen and the author in [\cite=die-spi:elliptic]. The given proof is taken from [\cite=die-spi:selberg], it models Anderson's proof of the Selberg integral described in [\cite=aar] (see Theorem 8.1.1 and Sect. 8.4). It represents also a direct generalization of Gustafson's method [\cite=gus:some] of derivation of the multiple q-beta integral obtained from [\eqref=SintB] after expressing t6 via other parameters, removing the multipliers pq with the help of the reflection formula for Γ(z;p,q), and taking the limit [formula]. A number of further limiting relations in parameters leads to the Selberg integral - the fundamentally important integral because of many applications in mathematical physics. Therefore formula [\eqref=SintB] represents an elliptic analogue of the Selberg integral (an analogous extension of Aomoto's integral described in Theorem 8.1.2 of [\cite=aar] is derived in [\cite=rai:trans]). It can be interpreted also as an elliptic extension of the BCn Macdonald-Morris constant term identities.

There are several other elliptic beta integrals on root systems. In particular, the author has suggested three different integrals for the An root system (two of them look different for even and odd values of n) in [\cite=spi:theta2]. In [\cite=spi-war:inversions], Warnaar and the author have found one more An-integral which appeared to be new even after degeneration to the q- and plain hypergeometric levels.

In analogy with the one dimensional case [\cite=spi:theta2], it is natural to expect that the multiple elliptic beta integrals define measures in the biorthogonality relations for some functions of many variables generalizing relations [\eqref=2ib]. In [\cite=rai:trans] [\cite=rai:abelian], Rains has constructed the first system of such functions on the basis of integral [\eqref=SintB]. These functions generalize also the Macdonald and Koornwinder orthogonal polynomials, as well as the interpolating polynomials of Okounkov. In this sense, the results of [\cite=rai:trans] [\cite=rai:abelian] represent to the present moment the top level achievements of the theory of elliptic hypergeometric functions of many variables. The author especially likes the following BCn-generalization of transformation [\eqref=E7-1] proven in [\cite=rai:trans]: [formula], where

[formula]

and [formula] is the elliptic gamma function of the higher level connected to the Barnes gamma function [formula].

Integral analogues of the Bailey chains. The Bailey chains, discovered by Andrews, serve as a powerful tool for building constructive identities for hypergeometric series (see Ch. 12 in [\cite=aar]). They describe mappings of given sequences of numbers to other sequences with the help of matrices admitting explicit inversions. So, the most general Bailey chain for the univariate q-hypergeometric series suggested in [\cite=and:bailey] is connected with the matrix attached to the 8φ7 Jackson sum [\cite=bre]. An elliptic generalization of this chain for the s + 1Vs-series was built in [\cite=spi:bailey1], but we do not consider here neither it nor its complement [\cite=war:extensions]. Instead of that, we present a generalization of the formalism of Bailey chains to the level of integrals discovered in [\cite=spi:bailey2].

We say that two functions α(z,t) and β(z,t) form an elliptic integral Bailey pair with respect to the parameter t, if they are connected by the relation

[formula]

For a given elliptic integral Bailey pair α(z,t) and β(z,t) with respect to the parameter t, the functions

[formula]

where [formula], form a new Bailey pair with respect to the parameter st, and the functions

[formula]

form a new Bailey pair with respect to the parameter t.

The proof is sufficiently simple. In the first case, it is necessary to substitute the key relation for β(x,t) in the definition of β'(w,st), to change the order of integrations and to take off one of the integrations with the help of the elliptic beta integral (we omit restrictions for the parameters necessary for validity of this procedure). The second relation is proved in a similar way. These chain substitution rules introduce two new parameters u and s at each step of their application. In fact, they are related to each other by the inversion of the integral operator entering the definition of integral Bailey pairs [\cite=spi-war:inversions].

This theorem is used in a way analogous to the series case: it is necessary to take initial α(z,t) and β(z,t), found, say, from formula [\eqref=ell-int], and to generate new pairs with the help of the described chain substitution rules. Equality [\eqref=int-bp] for these pairs leads to a binary tree of identities for elliptic hypergeometric integrals of different multiplicities. As an illustration, we would like to give one nontrivial relation. With the help of formula [\eqref=ell-int], one can easily verify validity of the following recurrence relation

[formula]

where [formula] and the integral I(m) was defined in [\eqref=gen-int]. By an appropriate change of notation for parameters, we obtain a concrete realization of the Bailey pairs: [formula] and [formula]. For m = 0, substitution of the explicit expression for I(0) [\eqref=ell-int] in the right-hand side of [\eqref=rec-int] yields identity [\eqref=E7-1]. Other interesting consequences of recursion [\eqref=rec-int] (an elliptic analogue of formula (2.2.2) in [\cite=aar]) are considered in [\cite=spi:thesis]. Various generalizations of the integral transformation [\eqref=int-bp] to root systems and their inversions are described in [\cite=spi-war:inversions].

Conclusion. We would like to finish by listing some other achievements of the theory of elliptic hypergeometric functions. Multiple elliptic hypergeometric series were considered for the first time by Warnaar [\cite=war:summation]. We described mostly properties of the elliptic hypergeometric integrals, since many results for the elliptic hypergeometric series represent their particular subcases and they can be derived via the residue calculus. A combinatorial derivation of the Frenkel-Turaev summation formula is given in [\cite=e-comb]. Various generalizations of this sum to the root systems were found in [\cite=die-spi:elliptic] [\cite=ros:elliptic] [\cite=spi:theta2] [\cite=war:summation], and multivariable analogues of the Bailey transformation were described in [\cite=kaj-nou] [\cite=rai:trans] [\cite=ros:elliptic] [\cite=war:summation]. Expansions in partial fractions of the products of theta functions and the identities connected to them were discussed by Rosengren [\cite=ros:elliptic] (see also [\cite=die-spi:selberg] [\cite=rai:trans]). The terminating continued fraction generated by three term recurrence relation [\eqref=ttr] and the Racah type termination condition was computed in [\cite=spi-zhe:rims]. The raising and lowering operators connected with rational functions were discussed in [\cite=rai:trans] [\cite=spi-zhe:grids]. Connection to the Sklyanin algebra is considered in [\cite=konno] [\cite=rai:abelian] [\cite=ros:elementary] [\cite=ros:sklyanin]. In particular, in [\cite=ros:sklyanin] Rosengren proved an old Sklyanin conjecture on the reproducing kernel. A systematic treatment of the elliptic determinant formulas connected to the root systems is given in the work of Rosengren and Schlosser [\cite=ros-sch3]. In [\cite=kmnoy], it was shown that the 12V11-series appears as a particular solution of the elliptic Painlevé equation discovered by Sakai [\cite=sak]. An analogous role is played by the general solution of the elliptic hypergeometric equation [\cite=spi:thesis] [\cite=spi:cs] and some multiple elliptic hypergeometric integrals [\cite=rai:rec]. The page limits of the present review did not allow the author to cite a number of other interesting results, an essentially more complete review of the literature is given in [\cite=spi:thesis].

Derivation of the 12V11-function from a similarity reduction of some discrete integrable system, given in [\cite=spi-zhe:spectral], reflects the essence of a heuristic approach to all special functions of one variable. This approach is described in detail in [\cite=spi:thesis] using a number of examples, including some other new special functions.

The main part of the plain hypergeometric constructions admits thus natural elliptic generalization, although such parallels emerge for a rather large number of free parameters and structural restrictions. Nevertheless there remain many open problems, in particular, analysis of the conditions of convergence of infinite elliptic hypergeometric series, investigation of specific properties of the points of finite order on the elliptic curve, computation of the nonterminating elliptic hypergeometric continued fraction, detailed analysis of the non-self-dual biorthogonal functions of [\cite=spi-zhe:spectral] and construction of their multivariable analogues, and so on.
