Surface State Magnetization and Chiral Edge States on Topological Insulators

-- Since the discovery of topological insulators (TI) [\cite=Fu_Kane_Mele] [\cite=Moore_Balents] [\cite=Roy] [\cite=Kane_RMP] [\cite=Zhang_RMP] and the synthesis of real materials that realize their physics [\cite=BiSb] [\cite=Zhang_DFT] [\cite=BiSe] [\cite=BiTe] there has been tremendous interest in their topologically protected surface states. Previous work has focused mainly on the cleavage surfaces of Bi2Se3, or similar TI's with Rm symmetry, that host spin-momentum locked helical metals with the conduction and valence bands exhibiting opposite helicities. Interestingly, a quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect can be induced by exchange coupling the surface electrons to a magnetic insulator which lifts the Kramers degeneracy at the surface Dirac point (DP). When the magnetization is perpendicular to the quintuple layers, this introduces a mass term into the cleavage surface state Hamiltonian, and if the Fermi energy is in this gap, there is a half integer quantized Hall conductivity σH = e2 / 2h whose sign is determined by the direction of perpendicular magnetization. Theory predicts a 1D chiral edge state on the Bi2Se3 cleavage surface along a domain wall where the perpendicular magnetization reverses direction [\cite=Fu_Kane_Mele] [\cite=Kane_RMP] [\cite=TFT]. The fabrication of such an interface that displays the QAH effect poses a formidable experimental challenge.

In this work, we consider the effects of magnetic exchange coupling to topological surface states for a general crystal termination and discover new geometries that generically host 1D chiral edge channels. By breaking T symmetry the surface magnetization: (i) shifts the DP off T invariant momenta, (ii) couples non cleavage surfaces, and (iii) lifts the Kramers degeneracy at any DP except on the side face where the Hall conductivity switches sign. We find that all three effects are crystal face-dependent. Surprisingly, 1D gapless chiral states can be induced at crystal edges without introducing a magnetic domain wall, accessing the QAH effect in a geometry that should be readily accessible to experiment. Interestingly, a recent experiment demonstrate bulk intergrowth of Bi2Se3 and the room temperature ferromagnet Fe7Se8 forms a "stack of cards" structure [\cite=Cava] that offers an opportunity for exploring the face-dependent interactions between TI surface states and ferromagnetic materials. Another advance in magnetically doped TI's realizes a ~  40 meV gap [\cite=dop2] [\cite=Samarth] and a giant AH effect [\cite=dop4] on the cleavage surface, providing a large out-of-plane Zeeman field to engineer the QAH effect in our new geometries.

-- We start from a description of the low energy minimal model of Bi2Se3, followed by a derivation of the effective Hamiltonian of topological surface states near the DP of an arbitral face [\cite=TISS]. These apply generally to other TI's with Rm symmetry. Besides T and the parity inversion (P) symmetries, Bi2Se3 crystal structure has threefold rotational (C3) symmetry along ẑ perpendicular to the quintuple layers (QL's), and twofold rotational (C2) symmetry along ΓM direction. By convention we choose [\cite=notation] the parity operator P  =  τz and the time reversal operator T = iKσy where K is the complex conjugate operation. To linear order in k the [formula] bulk Hamiltonian that preserves the above four symmetries has a unique form

[formula]

where we assume [formula] and [formula]. By matching the eigensystems of TI with m > 0 and vacuum with m  →    -    ∞  , one can demonstrate the existence of topological surface states [\cite=TISS]. As shown in Ref.[\cite=TISS], the DP solution is determined by the operators [formula] and is free under any rotation of the operators [formula]. We first focus on the case with a crystal termination where the azimuthal angle is fixed (φ = 0) and later generalize to situations where φ is allowed to vary between neighboring crystal facets. For an arbitrary face Σ(θ) (0  ≤  θ  ≤  π) in Fig.[\ref=fig:fg1], [formula] and [formula] pseudospins read

[formula]

where [formula], α = vz cos θ / v3 and [formula]. These pseudospins satisfy = 2iδabεijkSka. We derive [\cite=TISS] the topological surface state Hamiltonian for face Σ(θ) to the linear order near DP,

[formula]

where [formula]. The surface band is the negative eigenstate of Sx1 and its chiral counterpart is localized on the opposite face. Thus the surface state Hilbert space is reduced by half. The pseudospin ([formula]) texture of surface states on a general face Σ(θ) is topologically equivalent to the helical metal found on the cleavage surface though its energy dispersion is anisotropic in momentum. However, the spin texture is different for each face [\cite=TISS] and is determined by the bulk symmetries. Near the DP the spin texture of a constant energy contour is helical only on the top (θ = 0) and bottom (θ  =  π) cleavage surfaces, it is collapsed to one dimension on any side face (θ  =  π / 2), and it is tilted out-of-plane otherwise. Interestingly on a side face with normal x, the spin texture is filtered into ±  y polarizations maximized at ky = 0 and vanishing at kz = 0. As a consequence, a Zeeman exchange field that couples to the physical spin σ plays qualitatively different roles on different crystal faces.

Physically, a mass term ΔSz2 or ΔSz2Sx1 in Eq.([\ref=eqn:Hs]) is required to open an energy gap at the surface DP. This amounts to introducing either one of the following external perturbations that break T symmetry

[formula]

The HΔ1 terms depend on the surface orientation through the θ dependence of α and β. On the cleavage surface (β = 0) this perturbation is a Zeeman term that can be induced by an exchange field, while on the side face (α = 0) it becomes σxτz which is negligibly small [\cite=g-factor] since it originates from the difference between electron spin g-factors of Bi and Se [\cite=notation]. In contrast, HΔ2 is independent of the crystal face angle but it requires a parity breaking interaction τx which seems to be infeasible.

-- Now we consider a magnetic thin film with uniform magnetization that provides an exchange coupling [formula] to the spin of TI surface states. Whether this breaking T symmetry coupling opens a gap at the DP on face Σ(θ) is determined by whether it generates any of the perturbations listed in Eq.([\ref=eqn:Hgap]). Rewritten in the basis represented by [formula] and [formula], the exchange coupling can be decomposed as follows:

[formula]

A topological surface state must be the negative eigenstate of Sx1 and its positive counterpart is localized on the opposite face. Thus the two fields proportional to Sz1 in Eq.([\ref=eqn:Hx]) and Eq.([\ref=eqn:Hz]) couple the surface states on different non cleavage faces (β  ≠  0). Although these two couplings play negligible roles as the TI dimension becomes larger than the surface state penetration length they can be important for a sufficiently thin TI with two parallel side faces. As illustrated in Fig.[\ref=fig:fg2], these two couplings hybridize the opposite surface states without opening any energy gap. The Sx2Sz1 term breaks up the two DP's which repel each other in the 1 direction, leading to two zero energy nodes at vzkz  =    ±  Δz and ky = 0 [\cite=overlap]. Sz2Sz1 field splits the two DP's in energy, resulting in a zero energy ellipse at [formula] [\cite=overlap].

For magnetization parallel to QL's, the induced exchange terms ΔxSx2 and ΔySy2 do not contain any mass terms listed in Eq.([\ref=eqn:Hgap]), and thus not open gaps at any surface DP's. Instead, they break T symmetry by shifting the DP from [formula] to a non T invariant momentum

[formula]

Eq.([\ref=eqn:Hdp]) implies that magnetization only moves the DP on the side face in ±  z direction. More generally, the surface state velocities (or helicities) are opposite for opposite faces. Thus the same magnetization moves their DP's in opposite directions in the crystal frame. Since a pair of opposite side faces are also connected by the rotational symmetry along z, shifting the side face DP's is allowed along z and forbidden along 2 defined in Fig.[\ref=fig:fg1].

As shown in Eq.([\ref=eqn:Hz]), the magnetization perpendicular to QL's introduces a field αΔzSz2 that behaves as HΔ1. This mass breaks T symmetry by lifting the Kramers degeneracy, leading to a surface state gap ~  2αΔz. Importantly, on the closed surface of a compact TI this gap is face-dependent: it is largest on the cleavage surface (θ  =  0,π) and it vanishes on the side face (θ  =  π / 2) where the mass switches sign.

-- We find that the momentum-space Berry curvature becomes nontrivial when T symmetry is broken by the mass term αΔzSz2. For an arbitrary face, the Berry curvature reads

[formula]

where [formula] and the symbol s =  + ( - ) denotes the surface conduction (valence) band. The momenta are measured from the shifted DP given in Eq.([\ref=eqn:Hdp]) in the presence of magnetization parallel to QL's. The orbital magnetic moment [\cite=Niu] [\cite=Zhang_SQH] carried by a surface state Bloch electron is

[formula]

where me is the electron mass and μB is the Bohr magneton. Unlike the Berry curvature, the orbital magnetization is independent of the band index s. In the presence of an electric field in the surface plane, a surface state electron acquires an anomalous transverse velocity proportional to the Berry curvature [\cite=Niu] [\cite=Zhang_SQH], giving rise to an intrinsic Hall conductivity

[formula]

where EF is the Fermi energy. Provided that EF lies in the surface gap, the surface band contributes e2 / 2h to the Hall conductivity, with the sign given by  sgn(αΔz).

This Hall conductivity is half integer quantized but with opposite signs for crystal faces with surface normals that have opposite z-projections ( i.e. perpendicular to QL's), even though the surface magnetization is uniform. Since ΔσH = e2 / h across the interface, there must be a chiral edge state channel whenever there is an edge or a narrow side face that connects two faces whose surface normals have opposite z-projections. This is the criterion for the existence of chiral edge states in the presence of uniform Δzσz magnetization on the surface of a TI.

We now propose three TI shapes that support chiral edge states in the presence of surface magnetization perpendicular to QL's and uniform on all relevant faces. For a spherical TI, shown in Fig.[\ref=fig:fg3](a), the mass term and the Hall conductivity switch sign across the equator (α = 0). Therefore, there is a chiral channel along the equator for gapless edge states. A TI slab depicted in Fig.[\ref=fig:fg3](b) is topologically equivalent in shape to a spherical TI, with the upper (lower) hemisphere becoming the top (bottom) cleavage surface. Similarly, there is a gapless chiral state along the side faces when the exchange field effect dominates over the finite size effect. The QAH effect in this bilayer (BL) system, studied before [\cite=TFT] [\cite=slab] [\cite=Hughes] and a special case where our criterion applies, can be alternatively described in the crystal frame as follows:

[formula]

where τx  =    ±   respectively represent the bottom and top surfaces and mt is a trivial mass due to finite size tunneling between the surfaces. We further obtain the four-band energy dispersions:

[formula]

As the exchange field strength Δz is turned up from zero, the energy gap closes at Δz  =    ±  mt and reopens, indicating the topological distinction between the magnetization-induced gap with respect to the tunneling-induced gap. Further analysis using Eq.([\ref=eqn:Hall]) shows the two valence bands have a total e2 / h contribution to σH when |Δz| > |mt|, leading to a QAH effect. This analysis applies generally to any other slab with θ  ≠  π / 2.

Our criterion also predicts chiral edge states on a TI with a more remarkable shape, as depicted in Fig.[\ref=fig:fg3](c). In the intergrowth with a ferromagnet [\cite=Cava], a TI often has zigzag side faces, typically a few microns in size. Each convex corner of the zigzag side connects an upper face with θN  <  π / 2 and a lower face with θS  >  π / 2 while a concave corner connects the two faces upside down. As a consequence, the zigzag side exhibits staggered chiral corner states with opposite velocities along the convex and concave corners. (These staggered chiral states can be coupled by interactions and may exhibit some exotic Luttinger liquid behaviors.) In the presence of an electric field perpendicular to the average face of the zigzag side, there will be a net chiral current carried by edge states at the convex or concave corners depending on the electric polarity, while for an electric field perpendicular to QL's edge states with opposite chiralities are both populated and the Hall currents become counterpropagating and canceling each other out on average.

In the limit of θN,S≃π / 2, the surface state Hilbert spaces for the upper and lower faces are both the negative eigenstate of Sx1(π / 2) = σyτy. The chiral corner states are also pseudospin filtered, since they satisfy Sx2(π / 2) = σzτz  =    ±  1 where the sign depends on the polarity of the Δzσz magnetization. These two features are analogous to the case of a magnetic domain wall deposited on the cleavage surface, where the chiral edge state is not only orbital chiral but also spin filtered.

In the opposite limit in which θN≃0 and θS≃π, these zigzag side faces become a chain of staggered top and bottom cleavage surfaces, in which the two opposite edges of each face are joined respectively to the opposite edges of the neighboring upper and lower faces. Our proposed criterion can be applied to each pair of neighboring faces. The origin of their chiral corner states can be also intuitively understood by our previous analysis (Eq.([\ref=eqn:bilayer])) designed for parallel double layers. In such a limit, the top and bottom surface states have zero orbital overlap in the sense that they are negative and positive eigenstates of τx, respectively. Under uniform Δzσz magnetization, the two surface valence bands contribute e2 / h to σH, however, the chiral edge state is not spin filtered because of the opposite helicities at the two surfaces. These features are quite different from the situation for two joined side faces or with a magnetic domain wall on the cleavage plane.

We now turn on the azimuthal angle, to study its influence on chiral edge states. Since the bulk crystal has C3 symmetry along z which upgrades to continuous rotational symmetry in linear order we can set φ = 0 along an arbitrary axis perpendicular to ẑ. But more generally for two crystal faces joined at an edge with normals along different azimuthal angles, we need to specify their difference Δφ to determine the chirality of their edge state. In fact, the criterion for the existence of chiral edge state at a TI corner can be relaxed to θ(Σσ) < π / 2 and [formula] with [formula], where ΣS,N(θ,φ) could even be curved faces or have different azimuthal angles. Fig.[\ref=fig:fg4] sketches a chiral state along the edges that connect a top face with four surrounding faces that have the same θs but different φs. The edge states have opposite chiralities for Δφ = 0 and π but not for other pair of azimuthal angles that differ in π.

-- In conclusion, we provide a general theory that allows a thorough understanding of the interaction of TI surface states with a ferromagnetically ordered medium, with a surprising criterion for the presence of a chiral edge state (QAH effect) with no need of magnetic anisotropy. This approach may also simplify the interferometry of Majorana fermions [\cite=MF_Kane] [\cite=MF_Beenakker] that requires to generate chiral edge states on the TI surface. Our proposed chiral edge states may be accessible by STM or in multi-terminal transport at the corners of a TI zigzag side that form [\cite=Cava] in the intergrowth with a ferromagnet. For a Δ  ~  1 meV gap induced by a Zeeman exchange field, the coherence length [formula] is about a micron, which is comparable to the size of zigzag side face. Our present work may shed light on cleavage surface transport experiments where it is crucial to minimize the influence from the side face, i.e., making samples in the square shape. On the other hand, this work also provides a new strategy for the fabrication of electronic devices that exploit the crystal face dependence of TI surface state phenomena. We thus suggest reexamining anomalies in existing data by taking into account the dependence of the surface states on the surface orientation and look forward to more explorations on the non cleavage surfaces.

A Zeeman field that couples to spin could also be introduced by doping TI's with magnetic impurities [\cite=dop1] [\cite=dop2] [\cite=slab] [\cite=dopnew0] [\cite=dopnew1] [\cite=dopnew2] [\cite=dopnew3] [\cite=dop3] [\cite=dop4] [\cite=Samarth] [\cite=dopNE] [\cite=dopNomura] [\cite=dopSamarth] [\cite=dop7] [\cite=dop8] [\cite=dop9] [\cite=dop10] [\cite=dop11] [\cite=dop_Yao] [\cite=dop12] [\cite=dop13] or partially by applying a parallel magnetic field [\cite=parallel-B] [\cite=parallel_Zhang] instead of depositing a ferromagnetic film [\cite=Cava] [\cite=Garate] [\cite=Hughes] [\cite=Wei] on the surface. With these experimental progresses, QAH effects are likely to occur when their TI samples are fabricated in geometries similar to Fig.[\ref=fig:fg3] or Fig.[\ref=fig:fg4]. We have noticed that a very special case of our proposed physics, i.e., a QAH effect in a magnetic doped Bi2Se3 slab with only two cleavage surfaces [\cite=TFT] [\cite=slab] [\cite=Hughes] and thickness less than six QL's, has been demonstrated by the first principle calculations [\cite=slab]. While observing QAH effects in thin films is still experimentally challenging, our newly discovered criterion does not necessarily require such a limited geometry and constitutes a significant advance. Finally we point out that the surface magnetization can be built into the topological boundary condition of TI's as a family of surface potentials [\cite=TISS] that break T symmetry but preserve P symmetry.
