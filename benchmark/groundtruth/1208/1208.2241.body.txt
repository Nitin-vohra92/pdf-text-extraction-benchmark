A note on the uniqueness of minimal length carrier graphs

Let M be a hyperbolic 3-manifold. A carrier graph for M is a finite graph X along with a map f : X  →  M such that [formula] is surjective. We will assume that π1(M) is finitely generated, and it is then clear that a carrier graph for M exists. We will only consider carrier graphs with [formula]. The length of an edge e of X, [formula], is the length of the path f|e (we assume f takes edges to rectifiable paths in M), and [formula] is the sum of the lengths of the edges of X. A minimal length carrier graph is a carrier graph with length less than or equal to the length of any other (minimal rank) carrier graph for M. In [\cite=W], White showed that if M is closed, then it has a minimal length carrier graph, and in [\cite=S], it is shown how to extend White's argument to a much larger class of hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Minimal length carrier graphs have nice geometric properties and were first used by White [\cite=W] to prove that if M is closed, then it has a nontrivial loop whose length is bounded above in terms of nothing more than the rank of π1(M). They have subsequently been used, for example, to show that rank equals Heegaard genus for large classes of hyperbolic 3-manifolds in [\cite=So], [\cite=B], and [\cite=NS].

Following Souto [\cite=So], we say that two carrier graphs f : X  →  M and g : Y  →  M are equivalent if there exists a homotopy equivalence η : X  →  Y so that f and gη are freely homotopic. We will say that f and g are strongly equivalent if there is a homeomorphism η : X  →  Y such that f = gη. In this note, we consider the following two uniqueness questions:

Must any two minimal length carrier graphs for M be strongly equivalent?

Must any two carrier graphs which both have minimal length within the same equivalence class be strongly equivalent?

The answer to both questions is no, according to the examples in Section [\ref=example]. However, we will prove two weaker uniqueness results in Section [\ref=theorems]. In order to state the results, we need one more (very strong) notion of equivalence. Two carrier graphs f,g : X  →  M are essentially equivalent if f = gη, where η : X  →  X is a homeomorphism that fixes vertices and leaves edges and their orientations invariant. In other words, f and g are the same except for reparameterizing the edges. Carrier graphs are essentially distinct if they are not essentially equivalent.

Let M be a hyperbolic 3-manifold and let f : X  →  M and g : X  →  M be carrier graphs, which either each have minimal length within their equivalence classes or each have minimal length globally. If f and g are homotopic, then they are essentially equivalent.

And although there may be more than one carrier graph of minimal length globally or within an equivalence class, we show

Let M be a hyperbolic 3-manifold that does not have a simply-degenerate, π1-surjective NP-end. Then M has only finitely many essentially distinct minimal length carrier graphs, and each equivalence class of carrier graphs can have only finitely many essentially distinct minimal length representatives.

The fact that a manifold satisfying the hypotheses of this theorem has a minimal length carrier is proved in [\cite=S]. In Section [\ref=sec:application], we will look at the action of the isometry group [formula] of M on the set of minimal length carrier graphs and derive a new proof of the following fact:

If M does not have a simply-degenerate, π1-surjective NP-end, then [formula] is finite.

Note that this corollary applies, for example, to all geometrically finite 3-manifolds.

The author would like to thank Peter Shalen for helpful guidance and Benson Farb for pointing out the above corollary.

Non-uniqueness example

Let M be a hyperbolic 3-manifold with [formula]. Suppose that M has a minimal length carrier graph f : X  →  M and that M has a fixed-point free isometry h of finite order not divisible by 3. Then hf is a minimal length carrier graph not strongly equivalent to f.

It is clear that hf is a minimal length carrier graph. Suppose it is strongly equivalent to f. Then there exists a homeomorphism η : X  →  X such that hf = fη. Note that η cannot fix any point x∈X, for then h would fix f(x). According to [\cite=W], minimal length carrier graphs must be trivalent. There are only two trivalent graphs of rank 2: one that looks like a θ and one that looks like eye-glasses. The eye-glasses graph does not admit a fixed-point free homeomorphism; so X is the θ graph. Up to homotopy, η must be the homeomorphism that swaps vertices and cyclically permutes the edges.

Let m be the order of h. Then hmf = fηm, which is equivalent to f = fηm. Since m is not divisible by 3, ηm cyclically permutes the edges of X. Hence, f must map each edge to the same image, which contradicts f being a carrier graph because [formula] would be trivial.

We can get concrete examples from this proposition. For example, let M be the figure 8 knot complement. Then M is a two-fold cover of the Gieseking manifold, hence it has a fixed-point free isometry h of order 2, and the rank of π1(M) is easily found to be two (from, say, the Wirtinger presentation); so M has non-unique minimal length carrier graphs.

We can also get closed examples. Reid [\cite=R] shows how to produce, for any p > 1, a closed hyperbolic 3-manifold M with a regular, cyclic cover N of degree p such that [formula]. If p is not divisible by 3, then N with its order p deck transformation satisfies the hypotheses of Proposition [\ref=nonunique] and thus has non-unique minimal length carrier graphs.

We can take these examples a bit further to get examples of carrier graphs which are minimal in the same equivalence class but are not strongly equivalent. Reid's manifolds are formed as follows. Let φ be a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism of a punctured torus T and let Mφ be the mapping torus of φ. Let a,b be generators of π1(T). Reid forms a manifold, which we are calling N, by taking the obvious p-fold cyclic cover of Mφ and performing a certain Dehn filling on it. It is shown that N is a p-fold cyclic cover of a manifold obtained from Dehn filling Mφ and the preimage of the filling torus for Mφ is the filling torus of N (in particular, the deck transformations of N leave the filling torus invariant). By abuse of notation, we will use a and b to refer to the generators of the fiber subgroup of Mφ and its cover and to their images in the filled manifold N. Reid shows that a and b generate π1(N). Let H be the filling torus of N. Then [formula] is fiber bundle over S1 with fiber a compact surface of genus 1 and with 1 boundary component. Choose representatives α and β of a and b, respectively, that lie in a particular fiber Σ of [formula]. If h is an order p deck-transformation of N, then [formula] and [formula] are loops in the fiber h(Σ) which also generate π1(N). Notice that there is a submanifold homeomorphic to Σ  ×  [0,1]  ⊂  N containing α, β, [formula] and [formula]. The manifold Σ  ×  [0,1] is a genus 2 handlebody and the pairs {α,β} and [formula] each generate its fundamental group. It is a well-known fact that any two minimal cardinality generating sets for the fundamental group of a handlebody are Nielsen equivalent; hence, h preserves the Nielsen equivalence class of the generating pair {a,b}.

Let [formula] be the carrier graph given by mapping one of the S1s to α and the other to β, and let f' be a carrier graph of minimal length in the equivalence class of f. Then [formula] has minimal length in the equivalence class of the graph coming from [formula] and [formula]. In [\cite=So], Souto shows how to associate an equivalence class of carrier graphs to a Nielsen equivalence class of generators for π1 and vice versa. His discussion of this correspondence implies that since h preserves the Nielsen equivalence class of {a,b}, f' and [formula] are equivalent. However, Proposition [\ref=nonunique] implies that these carrier graphs are not strongly equivalent. Hence, minimal length carrier graphs are not unique even within an equivalence class.

Weaker forms of uniqueness

For the proof of Theorem [\ref=main_thm], we will need a lemma.

Let x, y and z be distinct points in [formula]. Let x' (resp. y') be the midpoint of the geodesic between x (resp. y) and z. Then [formula], and equality is achieved exactly when the angle [formula] is 0 or π.

Let a = d(x',z), b = d(y',z), c = d(x',y') and [formula]. We wish to show that 2c  ≤  d(x,y). This is equivalent to cosh (2c)  ≤   cosh (d(x,y)). By the hyperbolic law of cosines,

[formula]

Now we just follow our noses: cosh (2c) = 2 cosh 2(c) - 1, so we need to show

[formula]

The left side is equal to

[formula]

Notice that

[formula]

So our goal becomes

[formula]

Using the identity cosh (2x) = 2 cosh 2(x) - 1 and some algebra, one can see that this is equivalent to

[formula]

It suffices to prove this inequality with the assumption that cos 2(γ) = 1, or equivalently, γ = 0,π. In this case, it is an equality, which follows from the identity cosh 2(b) =  sinh 2(b) + 1.

Suppose f and g are homotopic and essentially distinct. Let H : X  ×  [0,1]  →  M be a homotopy from f to g. The space X  ×  [0,1] can be triangulated as follows. Let e  ⊂  X be an edge. Suppose e has distinct endpoints. Then a homeomorphism from e to

[formula]

In the examples following Proposition [\ref=nonunique], we found that minimal length carrier graphs were not unique because we can compose them with ambient isometries to get new carrier graphs. It is perhaps natural to wonder if any two minimal length carrier graphs are related in this way (up to reparamaterizing their edges). If this were true, then the well-known fact that for a large class of hyperbolic 3-manifolds M, [formula] is finite, would imply Theorem [\ref=finite], that there are only finitely many minimal length carrier graphs. We will prove this theorem directly using Theorem [\ref=main_thm] via the following proposition and then prove the finiteness of isometry groups as a corollary in the next section.

Let M be a finite volume hyperbolic 3-manifold and let L > 0. There are only finitely many carrier graphs which are minimal length within their equivalence class and have length less than or equal to L.

Suppose M has an infinite sequence of carrier graphs fi : X  →  M, each of minimal length within its equivalence class and each with length less than or equal to L. Being minimal length implies the graphs are trivalent. There are only finitely many trivalent graphs of a particular rank; so we may pass to a subsequence and assume that every Xi is homeomorphic to a particular graph X. We will continue to call this sequence fi. Since the fi have bounded length and a carrier graph cannot be contained in a cusp (because this would imply that π1(M) is a quotient of the cusp group [formula]), there is a bound on how deep into a cusp neighborhood the image of any fi may penetrate. Hence, the fi all map into one compact subset of M. Additionally, the bound on the length of the fi implies that the sequence is equicontinuous. We can now apply the Arzelà-Ascoli theorem to get that a subsequence of {fi} converges uniformly. Therefore, for some large i and j, fi is sufficiently close to fj that the two maps must be homotopic. This contradicts Theorem [\ref=main_thm].

Let M be a finite volume hyperbolic 3-manifold. Let C be the set of minimal length carrier graphs for M, and let L be the length of any element of C. Elements of C clearly have minimal length within their equivalence classes. Thus, C is contained in the set of carrier graphs which are of minimal length in their equivalence classes and have length less than or equal to L. The latter set is finite, by virtue of Proposition [\ref=prop].

Similarly, the set of carrier graphs of minimal length within a particular equivalence class is seen to be finite by letting L be the length of any minimal length representative and applying Proposition [\ref=prop] in the same way.

An application to isometry groups

We will now give a new proof of the previously known result that a hyperbolic 3-manifold that does not have a simply-degenerate, π1-surjective NP-end has finite isometry group. The proof is simple and follows from Theorem [\ref=finite] and basic facts about minimal length carrier graphs. It requires knowing that such manifolds have minimal length carrier graphs, which was proved in [\cite=S]. That proof relies on the proof of the tameness theorem by Agol and Calegari-Gabai. However, the tameness theorem is not needed for the case in which the 3-manifold is geometrically finite. Thus, when the following theorem is restricted to geometrically finite 3-manifolds, its proof is entirely elementary.

If M does not have a simply-degenerate, π1-surjective NP-end, then [formula] is finite.

Let C be the set of essential equivalence classes of minimal length carrier graphs in M. By Theorem 1 of [\cite=S], this set is nonempty, and by Theorem [\ref=finite], this set is finite. It is clear that [formula] acts on C, which gives a map from [formula] to the finite group of permutations of C. Let K be the kernel of this map. It suffices to show that K is finite. Isometries of M that are in K fix a minimal length carrier graph f : X  →  M up to essential equivalence. In particular, for some vertex v∈X, they fix f(v) and permute the images of the three edges attached to v. This gives a map from K to S3, the permutation group on three elements. An element h of the kernel of this map would fix f(v) and the three tangent vectors at f(v) corresponding to the three edges of X attached to v. Since the angles between these edges are all 2π / 3, these tangent vectors span a plane in the tangent space. Lifting to [formula], h̃ would fix some preimage of f(v) and fix a hyperplane going through f(v) pointwise (since it is an isometry and fixes the tangent plane). Hence, h must be the identity map. Thus, K injects into S3, which means that K is finite. Therefore, [formula] is finite.
