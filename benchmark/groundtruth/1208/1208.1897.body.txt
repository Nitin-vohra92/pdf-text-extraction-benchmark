Introduction

Let F be a set consisting of proper subobjects of an object with an algebraic structure. Examples of F include the set of proper subgroups of a finite group, the set of proper subspaces of a vector space, and the set of proper ideals of a commutative ring. One may define an undirected graph, containing no loops and no multiple edges, constructed from F as follows: there is a vertex for each subobject in F, and there is an edge between two vertices whenever the intersection of the subobjects representing the vertices is not the zero object, where the zero object denotes the object having a unique endomorphism. For instance, if F is the set of proper subgroups of a finite group then the zero object is the trivial subgroup consisting of only the identity of the group. The graph constructed above is usually called the intersection graph of F, and it is studied in many papers. The intersection graphs of the proper subgroups of a finite group, the proper subspaces of a finite dimensional vector space over a finite field, certain affine subspaces, and the proper ideals of a commutative ring are studied in, for instance, [\cite=Chak] [\cite=Jaf] [\cite=Jaf2] [\cite=Jaf3] [\cite=Lai] [\cite=Shen] [\cite=Zel] and some of the references there.

In this paper, we study the intersection graph of the proper submodules of any module over any ring. Therefore, most of the results in the some of the above papers will be easy consequences of some of the results obtained here. The connectivity and the clique number of the intersection graph of the proper submodules of a module are studied in [\cite=Ak]. Here we study more aspects of the intersection graph of the proper submodules of a module and obtain more results.

Throughout the paper R is a unital ring which is not necessarily commutative and V is a unitary left R-module. By a proper R-submodule of V we mean an R-submodule of V different from 0 and V. We denote by G(V) the intersection graph of the proper R-submodules of V. Therefore, G(V) is an undirected graph without loops and multiple edges defined as follows: the vertex set is the set of all proper R-submodules of V, and there is an edge between two distinct vertices U and W if and only if [formula]

In Sections 2 and 3, we determine the algebraic structure of the module V for which the graph G(V) has any one of the following properties: it is connected; it has a cut vertex; it has a cut edge; it has an n-cycle; it is bipartite. Most of the results in Sections 2 and 3 are easy to derive, we include them for completeness.

As the number of R-submodules of V is usually not finite, the graph G(V) will usually have infinitely many vertices. Most of the notions and results coming from finite graph theory are not true for infinite graphs, see, for instance, [\cite=Bas] [\cite=Ore]. However, we observe that this is not a problem for the study of the graph G(V). For example, in Section 4, we justify that G(V) has a minimal dominating set for any V, and we determine the domination number of G(V) for any V, which may be an infinite cardinal number.

In Section 5, we find the number of the maximal R-submodules of V, from which we obtain the structure of V for which G(V) has finitely many vertices. We also obtain more results about the number of submodules in Section 6.

We study the chromatic number of G(V) in Section 7. For instance, we determine the structure of V for which the chromatic number of G(V) is finite. We also calculate the chromatic number of G(V) when V is a semisimple module having a (finite) composition series. This result is still general enough to cover the known results (about the chromatic number of the intersection graph of the proper subspaces of a vector) as special cases.

In the last section, we determine the structure of V for which the graph G(V) is planar.

To explain our notations and terminologies, let W be an R-module. We denote by Jac(W) and Soc(W) the Jacobson radical of W and the socle of W, respectively. By a section of W we mean a quotient module of a submodule of W, so sections of W are of the form Y / X where X  ⊆  Y are R-submodules of W. For any natural number n, the direct sum of n modules all of which are W is denoted by nW. The sets of R-module endomorphisms and automorphisms of W are denoted by EndR(W) and AutR(W), respectively. We write U  ≤  W to indicate that U is an R-submodule of W. Moreover, for R-submodules U' and U of W, we say that U' is a complement of U in W if [formula] and U + U' = W.

Let G be a graph. If there is a finite path in G from a vertex v to a vertex w, then we use the ordered tuple (u1,u2,...,un) to denote this path, where u1 = v and un = w, and each ui is a vertex on the path, and for any i with 1  ≤  i  ≤  n - 1 there is an edge on the path between ui and ui + 1.

Connectedness

For any distinct proper R-submodules X and Y of V, we let dV(X,Y) denote the distance between X and Y, which is defined to be the length of the shortest path in G(V) between X and Y. By the length of a path we mean the cardinality of the set of all the edges on the path. Although the definition of the distance above may be meaningless for a graph with infinitely many vertices and edges, we see in this section that if there is a path in G(V) between two vertices then we may choose one with the length less than or equal to 2. In a graph it may happen that there is no path between some vertices, in which case, the distance is undefined, and such graphs are called disconnected. Moreover, in an infinite graph the distance between two vertices may be an infinite cardinal number. However, in the intersection graph of a module we observe in this section that the distance between any two distinct vertices is a finite number. We define the diameter of a connected graph G to be the largest of the distances between distinct vertices of G, if such a largest distance exists. If G has no distinct vertices, we assume that the diameter is 0. See, for instance, [\cite=Ore] and [\cite=West].

Let X and Y be distinct proper R-submodules of V. Then, there is no path in G(V) between X and Y if and only if X and Y are simple R-submodules of V, and [formula] direct sum of X and Y.

Suppose that there is no path in G(V) between X and Y. In particular [formula] Take any nonzero submodule Z of X. Then [formula] If Z + Y  ≠  V, then (X,Z + Y,Y) is a path of length 2. Hence, [formula] and Z + Y = V for any nonzero submodule Z of X. In particular, V is the direct sum [formula] of X and Y. Moreover, the modular law shows that X is simple. See, for instance, [\cite=Warf] for the modular law.

Conversely, if V is a direct sum of two simple modules, then any proper submodule of V is simple so that G(V) has no edges in this case.

The proof of the previous result implies the following.

Let X and Y be distinct proper R-submodules of V. If there is a path in G(V) between X and Y, then dV(X,Y)  ≤  2.

The following is an obvious consequence of [\ref=2.1], and it generalizes the related results of [\cite=Chak]. The previous result is a restatement of [\cite=Ak], which is obtained in a slightly different way.

If G(V) has an edge then G(V) is connected.

Suppose that G(V) has an edge. Then, V must have two distinct proper submodules such that at least one of them must be not simple. The result follows from [\ref=2.3].

G(V) has no edges if and only if V has a composition series of length less than or equal to 2.

Suppose that G(V) has no edges. If V has an ascending or descending chain of n proper submodules, then there will be an edge between any two of these n submodules. This shows that V has a composition series of length less than or equal to 2. The converse is clear, because in this case if there is a proper submodule of V then it must be simple.

As an easy consequence of [\ref=2.2] we state that if G(V) is connected, then the possibilities for the diameter of G(V) are 0, 1, and 2. The diameter of G(V) is 0 or 1 if and only if the intersection of any two nonzero R-submodules of V is nonzero (equivalently, every nonzero R-submodule of V is indecomposable). Such a module is called a uniform module. See, for instance, [\cite=Lam] [\cite=Warf] for uniform modules.

Let v be a vertex of a graph G. By G - v we mean the graph obtained from G by removing the vertex v and all the edges adjacent to v. If G - v has more connected components than G has, then v is called a cut vertex of G.

G(V) has a cut vertex if and only if the socle of V is a direct sum of two simple R-modules and is a maximal R-submodule of V. Moreover, in this case, the socle of V is the unique cut vertex of G(V).

Let X be a cut vertex of G(V). There must be two distinct vertices A and B of G(V) - X such that there is a path in G(V) between A and B, but there is no path in G(V) - X between A and B. Hence, [formula] and [\ref=2.2] implies that (A,X,B) is a path in G(V). In particular, [formula] and [formula] Moreover, X must be a maximal R-submodule of V, because, for any proper submodule Y of V containing X properly, (A,Y,B) is a path in G(V) - X between A and B. To see that X is a direct sum of two simple modules, we take any nonzero submodule A' of [formula] and any nonzero submodule B' of [formula] If A' + B'  ≠  X, then (A,A' + B',B) is a path in G(V) - X between A and B. Hence, X = A' + B', implying that X is the direct sum of the modules [formula] and [formula] which are necessarily simple as a consequence of the modular law. For the modular law see, for instance, [\cite=Warf]. Finally, we want to see that X is equal to the socle of V. Otherwise, there is a simple submodule S of V not contained in X. But then,

[formula]

is a path in G(V) - X.

Conversely, letting Z be the socle of V, we suppose that [formula] is the direct sum of two simple modules U and T, and Z is a maximal submodule of V. The vertices U and T are connected by the path (U,Z,T) in G(V). We will observe that there is no path in G(V) - Z between U and T, implying that Z is a cut vertex. Suppose for a moment that there is a path in G(V) - Z between U and T. Let U1 and T1 be the vertices on this path such that U1 is adjacent to U and T1 is adjacent to T by some edges on the path. Then, [formula] and [formula] and as U and T are both simple, U  ≤  U1 and T  ≤  T1. Since V has a composition series of length 3, we see that U1 and T1 are maximal submodules of V, and the intersection of any two distinct maximal submodules of V is simple. Therefore, [formula] and [formula] implying that [formula] But, being simple, [formula] must be a submodule of the socle Z, from which the last equality implies that [formula] This is impossible because [formula] is a simple module.

Let e be an edge of a graph G. By G - e we mean the graph obtained from G by removing the edge e. But we keep the endpoints of e so that the vertices of G - e and G are the same. If G - e has more connected components than G has, then e is called a cut edge of G.

G(V) has a cut edge if and only if V has a composition series of length 3, and V has a simple R-submodule that is contained in a unique maximal R-submodule of V. Moreover, in this case, the cut edges in G(V) are precisely the edges incident to the mentioned simple modules.

Let e be a cut edge of G(V) connecting the vertices A and B. There must be two vertices such that every path between them contains the edge e. Thus, there must be no path between A and B other than e. As [formula] if A,B, and [formula] are all distinct then [formula] is a path between A and B. Hence, we may assume that B < A. If there is a submodule X of V properly lying between the submodules 0 and B, then (A,X,B) is a path between A and B. This shows that B must be simple. Similarly, we see that A / B and V / A are also simple. So far, we have shown that 0 < B < A < V is a composition series of V of length 3.

If J is a maximal submodule of V other than A that contains B, then (A,J,B) is a path between A and B. Hence, the only maximal submodule of V containing B is A.

Conversely, suppose V has a composition series of length 3 and it has a simple submodule S that is contained in a unique maximal submodule W of V. We will show that the edge f between S and W is a cut edge. Suppose for a moment that f is not a cut edge. There must be a path other than f between S and W. Let T be the vertex on this path which is adjacent to S by an edge on the path. In particular, T  ≠  W. As S is simple, we see that S < T. Since the composition length of V is 3, it now follows that T is a maximal submodule of V containing S.

Cycles

In this section we study the existence of cycles in G(V). We begin with an easy observation.

Let m  ≥  3 be a natural number. If G(V) has no m-cycles, then V has a composition series of length less than or equal to m.

If V has an ascending or descending chain of n proper submodules, then it is clear that the subgraph of G(V) induced by these n submodules is the complete graph. So, in particular, there is an n-cycle in G(V). The result follows.

(i)[formula](ii): Obvious.

(ii)[formula](iii): Suppose that G(V) has no 3-cycles. It follows from [\ref=3.1] that V has a composition series of length less than or equal to 3. Assume that the composition length of V is 3. We want to show that V has a unique maximal submodule. Suppose for a moment that V has two maximal submodules J1 and J2. It is clear that J1,J2, and [formula] are distinct. We see that [formula] because, otherwise, [formula] is a 3-cycle. As [formula] the natural map

[formula]

is an injective R-module homomorphism, which must be surjective because J1 + J2 = M. But then, V is isomorphic to the direct sum of the simple modules V / J1 and V / J2, implying that the composition length of V is 2.

(iii)[formula](i): If V has a composition series of length less than or equal to 2, then any nonzero submodule of V is simple, so that G(V) has no edges.

Suppose now that the composition length of V is 3, and that V has a unique maximal submodule J. Then, every proper submodule of V is inside J. As the composition length of J is 2, every proper submodule of V different from J is simple. Consequently, G(V) is the star K1,c, where J is adjacent to all the other vertices (= all the proper submodules of J), and there are no edges between the vertices other than J, and c denotes the cardinality of the set of all the proper submodules of J. Hence, we have observed in both cases that there are no cycles.

A graph G is called bipartite if the vertex set of G can be written as a disjoint union of two (possibly empty) sets V1 and V2 such that any edge in G connects a vertex in V1 with a vertex in V2. See, for instance, [\cite=Ore].

G(V) is bipartite if and only if either V has a composition series of length less than or equal to 2, or V has a composition series of length 3 and it has a unique maximal R-submodule.

Suppose that G(V) is bipartite. Then, it is clear and well known that G(V) has no odd cycles (see, for instance, [\cite=Ore]). The result now follows from [\ref=3.2]. The converse follows from the last part of the proof of [\ref=3.2].

The results [\ref=3.2] and [\ref=3.3] generalize the related results of [\cite=Chak].

Domination

In this section we determine the domination number of G(V). This is already done in the special cases where R is a commutative ring and V = R, and where R is a finite field and V is a finite dimensional vector space over R, see [\cite=Jaf] and the references there. Here, without using the results in these special cases, we determine the domination number of G(V) in the most general case where the ring R and the R-module V are arbitrary.

We sometimes use the following result of [\cite=Fla] which describes the submodules of the direct sum of two modules. It is a simple modification of a result for groups known as Goursat's lemma.

Let U and W be R-modules. Then:

where

and, for any (u,w)∈p1(M)  ×  p2(M), the isomorphism θM sends u + k1(M) to w + k2(M) if and only if (u,w)∈M. Furthermore, the three R-modules

are isomorphic.

to the module

Let U and W be R-submodules of an R-module V such that [formula] Although [\ref=4.1] is stated for the external direct sum of two modules, it also describes the submodules of the internal direct sum [formula] because the R-modules [formula] and U  ×  W are isomorphic. Indeed, [\ref=4.1] is stated in [\cite=Fla] for an internal direct sum of two submodules of a module.

Let G be a graph. By a dominating set for G we mean a subset D of the vertex set of G such that every vertex not in D is joined to at least one vertex in D by some edge. A dominating set D is called a minimal dominating set if D' is not a dominating set for any subset D' of D with D'  ≠  D. The domination number of G is the smallest of the cardinalities of the minimal dominating sets for G. See, for instance, [\cite=Ore]. An infinite graph may not have a minimal dominating set, in which case, the domination number is not defined. However, we observe in this section that the intersection graph of any module has a minimal dominating set.

In our case, a set S of proper R-submodules of V is a dominating set for G(V) if and only if for any proper R-submodule U of V there is a W in S such that [formula]

The existence of a maximal element mentioned in the following result is guaranteed by Zorn's lemma.

Given any nonzero R-submodule U of V which is not simple, take a maximal element W of the set [formula], a poset with respect to the subset or equal to relation. If A is a dominating set for G(U), then the set {T + W:T∈A} is a dominating set for G(V).

Take a proper R-submodule Y of V. We want to show that [formula] for some T∈A. We have three possibilities for the intersection [formula] It is either a proper submodule of U, or U, or else 0.

If [formula] is a proper submodule of U, then there is a T1∈A such that [formula] as A is a dominating set for G(U). As [formula] this implies that [formula]

If [formula] then Y contains U and so contains every element of A. Thus, for any T2∈A, we have that [formula]

Suppose now that [formula] If Y  ≤  W then [formula] for any T3∈A. So we assume that Y is not contained in W, implying that W is a proper subset of Y + W. The maximality of W gives that [formula] As U is not simple, there is a nonzero element u in [formula] such that 0  ≠  Ru  ≠  U. (If [formula] is not equal to U, then u may be any element of [formula]). Since A is a dominating set for G(U), there is a T4∈A such that [formula] Hence, there is an r∈R such that ru is a nonzero element of T4. As ru is in Y + W (because u is in it), we write ru = y + w for some y∈Y and w∈W. Note that both of y and w are nonzero, because [formula] and [formula] Then, y = ru - w∈(T4 + W) is a nonzero element of [formula]

Assuming that the domination numbers of G(U) and G(V) are defined, the above result implies that the domination number of G(U) is greater than or equal to the domination number of G(V) for any non zero and non simple R-submodule U of V. In the next result we see a case in which a converse inequality holds.

Let V be a semisimple R-module containing a direct sum of three simple modules, and let C be the set of all R-submodules of V that can be written as a direct sum of two simple R-modules. Let A be a minimal dominating set for G(V). Then, there is a U∈C such that [formula] for all A∈A. Moreover, for any such U, the nonzero elements of the set [formula] forms a dominating set for G(U).

We first show the existence of such an element U of C. Suppose the contrary. Take any element W of C. By the assumption there is an A∈A such that [formula] We will show that A  -  {A} forms a dominating set for G(V), which contradicts to the minimality of A.

Let X be a proper R-submodule of V. We need to show that the intersection of X with an element of A  -  {A} is nonzero. As A is a dominating set for G(V), the intersection of X with an element of A is nonzero. So, we may assume that [formula] As V is semisimple, A has a complement B in V so that we write [formula] Note that B is nonzero as A∈A. Again by using the semisimplicity of V, we choose a simple R-submodule S1 of [formula] and a simple R-submodule S2 of B. We then let W' = S1 + S2. As [formula] the simple modules S1 and S2 are different so that W'∈C. Since we assumed the contrary, there is a A'∈A such that [formula] Now, S2 is in A' but not in A, proving that A'  ≠  A, so A'∈A  -  {A}. Moreover, [formula] because it contains S1.

Having proved the existence of such an element U of C, we see that what is left is trivial to justify.

We now state the main result of this section. For a graph G we denote by γ(G) the domination number of G. If V is a simple R-module then, of course, G(V) has no vertices so that γ(G(V)) = 0.

Suppose that V is not a simple R-module. Then:

(1) This is trivial, because it is well known that an application of Zorn's lemma shows that: V is not a semisimple module if and only if V has a proper essential submodule (that is, a submodule intersecting every nonzero submodule of V nontrivially). See, for instance, [\cite=Warf].

(2) Suppose that V is a semisimple module having at least two nonisomorphic simple submodules, say S1 and S2. We here show that γ(G(V)) = 2. The converse implication will follow by the virtue of parts (1) and (3), because Schur's lemma implies that EndR(S) is a division ring and so |EndR(S)| + 1  ≥  3.

Let V1 be the sum of all simple R-submodules of V isomorphic to S1, and let V2 be a complement of V1 in V so that [formula] By their constructions, V1 and V2 have no isomorphic sections. Thus, it follows from [\ref=4.1] that the submodules of V are of the form [formula] where X  ≤  V1 and Y  ≤  V2. Now, it is obvious that the set {V1,V2} forms a dominating set for G(V). So, γ(G(V))  ≤  2, but it cannot be 1 by part (1).

(3) Firstly, we show that G(V) has a minimal dominating set of cardinality |EndR(S)| + 1 where S is a simple submodule of V. Take any submodule U of V that is a direct sum of two simple modules. Let A be a dominating set for G(U). As the proper submodules of U are all simple, A consists of all the proper submodules of U. Using [\ref=4.1] we see that the submodules of S  ×  S are precisely

[formula]

where α is ranging in the set of all the automorphisms of S. As U is isomorphic to S  ×  S, we count the number of the proper submodules of U as |Aut(S)| + 2. Since S is simple, Schur's lemma implies that |A| = |EndR(S)| + 1. Since V is semisimple, U has a complement W in V. Now it follows from [\ref=4.2] that the set B  =  {T + W:T∈A} is a dominating set for G(V). As [formula] we see that the modules T + W are all distinct where T is ranging in A, so that |B| = |A|. So far we have proved that B is a dominating set for G(V) of desired cardinality. To see that B is a minimal dominating set, we simply observe that, for any T∈A, the only element of B adjacent to T is T + W, because of [formula]

To finish the proof, we show that any minimal dominating set for G(V) has cardinality greater than or equal to |EndR(S)| + 1. Indeed, let D be a minimal dominating set for G(V). Using [\ref=4.3] we deduce that V has a submodule U' isomorphic to S  ×  S such that U' has a dominating set of cardinality less than or equal to |D|. As in the previous paragraph, since U' is isomorphic to S  ×  S, we see that any dominating set for G(U') must contain every proper submodule of U' and that U' has |EndR(S)| + 1 proper submodules.

The proof of the above result shows that the intersection graph of any module has a minimal dominating set.

Finiteness

In this section we investigate the modules V for which G(V) has finitely many vertices.

Let S be a simple R-module and n be a natural number. Let Sn denote the direct sum

[formula]

which is a semisimple R-module of composition length n. If wn denotes the number of maximal R-submodules of Sn, then [formula] where d = |EndR(S)|. In particular, for n  ≥  2, wn is finite if and only if d is finite.

We write Sn + 1 = Sn  ×  S. It follows from [\ref=4.1] that there is a bijection from the set of all R-submodules of Sn + 1 to the set of all quintuples (U1,U2,θ,W2,W1) where U2  ≤  U1  ≤  Sn and W2  ≤  W1  ≤  S and θ:U1 / U2  →  W1 / W2 is an isomorphism of R-modules. Since S is simple, the quintuples are

[formula]

where U  ≤  Sn  ≥  U1  ≥  U2, and 1 is the unique isomorphism between the zero modules U / U, 0 / 0, and S / S, and θ is an isomorphism from U1 / U2 to S / 0, and U2 is a maximal submodule of U1. Using [\ref=4.1] again we now want to determine which quintuples correspond to the maximal submodules of Sn + 1. It is clear (especially from the isomorphisms of three modules in part (2) of) [\ref=4.1] that the quintuples corresponding to the maximal submodules of Sn + 1 are precisely

[formula]

where U and U2 are maximal submodule of Sn, and 1 and θ are isomorphisms as above. The number of quintuples of the form (U,U,1,S,S) where U is a maximal submodule of Sn is wn. The number of quintuples of the form (Sn,U2,θ,0,S) where U2 is a maximal submodule of Sn and θ:Sn / U2  →  S / 0 is an isomorphisms is |AutR(S)|wn because, for any maximal submodule U2 of Sn, the number of isomorphisms from Sn / U2 to S / 0 is equal to the number of automorphisms of S. As S is simple, Schur's lemma implies that |AutR(S)| = d - 1. Consequently, the number of quintuples corresponding to the maximal submodules of Sn + 1 is 1 + wn + (d - 1)wn. Hence, we obtain the recurrence relation

[formula]

which can be easily solved to obtain the result.

Suppose that we have an n dimensional vector space over a finite field with d elements. One may count the number of its maximal subspaces more easily to be [formula] the same number in [\ref=5.1]. We see in the next section that this is not a coincidence.

Let W = V1  ×  V2  ×    ·    ·    ·    ×  Vr where Vi = niTi, so that [formula] It follows from [\ref=4.1] that the submodules of W are of the form A1  ×  A2  ×    ·    ·    ·    ×  Ar where Ai  ≤  Vi for each i. Moreover, it is clear that A1  ×  A2  ×    ·    ·    ·    ×  Ar is a maximal submodule of W if and only if there is an index k such that Ak is a maximal submodule of Vk and Ai = Vi for any i different from k. Therefore, the result follows from [\ref=5.1].

In the following we characterize R-modules V for which G(V) has finitely many vertices.

The number of R-submodules of V is finite if and only if the following conditions hold:

Suppose that the number of submodules of V is finite. It is clear that V can not contain an infinite ascending or descending chain of submodules so that V is both Noetherian and Artinian, and hence it has a (finite) composition series. Suppose that there are submodules X  ≤  Y of V such that Y / X is semisimple and that Y / X has a submodule isomorphic to the direct sum S  ×  S for some simple module S. It follows from [\ref=5.1] that the number of submodules of Y / X is greater than 1 + |EndR(S)|. As the number of submodules of V is greater than or equal to the number of submodules of Y / X, it follows that EndR(S) is finite.

Conversely, suppose that V is a module satisfying the conditions (a) and (b). Suppose for a moment that V has infinitely many submodules. Because of (a), every proper submodule of V is contained in a maximal submodule of V. Hence, either V has infinitely many maximal submodules or there is a maximal submodule V1 of V such that V1 has infinitely many submodules. The first possibility does not occur here, because the number of maximal submodules of V is equal to the number of maximal submodules of the semisimple module V / Jac(V), which is finite because of (b) and [\ref=5.2]. Therefore, V1 has infinitely many submodules, and applying the same argument to V1 we find a maximal submodule V2 of V1 such that V2 has infinitely many submodules. Applying the same argument to V2 we obtain V3. Continuing in this way we find an infinite descending chain V > V1 > V2 > V3  >    ·    ·    ·    >    ·    ·    ·  . This contradicts with (a).

Suppose that G(V) has an edge. Then, G(V) has finitely many vertices if and only if G(V) has finitely many edges.

Suppose that there are finitely many vertices. Since G(V) has no multiple edges, it must have finitely many edges. Conversely, suppose that there are finitely many edges. As G(V) has an edge, it follows form [\ref=2.4] that G(V) has no isolated vertices. As an edge determines two vertices, we see that G(V) must have finitely many vertices.

Counting

In this section we want to obtain more counting results about the submodules of a semisimple module.

We begin with an elementary observation. For the lack of an appropriate reference, we include a short justification.

the R-submodule of V generated by the set {f(v):f∈J,v∈V}. For any R-submodule W of V we let

Then, the maps φ*:P  →  Q and φ*:Q  →  P are mutually inverse poset isomorphisms.

and for any right A-submodule U of Cn(A) we let

where ei1 denote the n  ×  1 matrix units in Cn(A) so that Xei1 is the ith column of X. Then, the maps φ*:R  →  T and φ*:T  →  R are mutually inverse poset isomorphisms.

(1) It is clear from their definitions that J  ≤  φ*φ*(J) and φ*φ*(W)  ≤  W for any right ideal J of EndR(V) and any submodule W of V. We will observe that the reverse inclusions are also true, implying that φ* and φ* are mutually inverse bijections.

As V is semisimple, there is a projection π∈EndR(V) onto W. Then, π∈φ*(W) and so W = π(V)  ≤  φ*φ*(W). Thus, φ*φ* is the identity.

As V is a semisimple R-module having a (finite) composition series, EndR(V) is a direct sum of finitely many matrix rings over division rings so that it is a semisimple ring. Thus, a right ideal J of EndR(V) must be principle generated by an idempotent fJ∈EndR(V), so that J = fJEndR(V). We then see that φ*(J) = fJ(V). Thus, if f∈φ*φ*(J) then f(V)  ⊆  φ*(J) = fJ(V). As fJ is an idempotent, the last containment shows that fJf = f, proving that f∈J. Thus, φ*φ* is the identity.

Finally, it is obvious from their definitions that both of φ* and φ* preserve orders. Hence, they must be poset isomorphisms.

(2) Straightforward.

When V is not a semisimple R-module, the maps in part (1) of [\ref=6.1] are no longer bijections, however they form an order preserving Galois connection. See, for instance, [\cite=Khu] and the references there.

For nonnegative integers n  ≥  m and for a natural number d  ≥  2, we let

[formula]

which is called the d-ary Gaussian binomial coefficient.

Let S be a simple R-module and n be a natural number. Let Sn denote the direct sum

[formula]

which is a semisimple R-module of composition length n. For any nonnegative integer i  ≤  n, let μi denote the number of R-submodules of Sn of composition length i. Let j and m be nonnegative integers less than or equal to n. Then:

where d = |EndR(S)|. In particular, for n  ≥  2, μi is finite if and only if d is finite.

In particular, the number of complements of U in W is d(n - j)j.

(1) Let A = EndR(S) which is a division ring by Schur's lemma. We use the notations in [\ref=6.1]. Observe that T may be identified with the poset of all the right A-submodules of

[formula]

an n dimensional vector space over the division ring A on which scalar acts from right. Moreover, as the ring EndR(Sn) is isomorphic to Mn(A), we see that the posets of all the right ideals of the rings EndR(Sn) and Mn(A) are isomorphic. The result now follows by the virtue of [\ref=6.1].

(2) By part (1), we see that μi is equal to the number of i dimensional subspaces of an n-dimensional vector space over a division ring. The number of such subspaces is easy to find. See, for instance, page 269 of [\cite=Bro], implying the result.

(3) This again follows from part (1) and [\cite=Bro].

The numbers in the last two parts of [\ref=6.2] may also be calculated by using [\ref=4.1]. However, reducing to the vector spaces simplifies calculations of these numbers. Moreover, using part (1) of [\ref=6.2] and [\ref=4.1], one may generalize known results on the poset of subspaces of a vector space to results on the poset of submodules of a semisimple module. We here give some examples of this.

Part (1) of [\ref=6.2] and [\ref=4.1] implies

Let V be a semisimple R-module having a (finite) composition series. Then, the lattice of R-submodules of V is isomorphic to a direct product of finitely many lattices of subspaces of finite dimensional vector spaces over division rings. More precisely, if

[formula]

where r is a natural number, T1,T2,...,Tr are mutually nonisomorphic simple R-modules, and n1,n2,...,nr are natural numbers, then we have the lattice isomorphism

[formula]

where Ui is an ni dimensional vector space over the division ring EndR(Ti) on which scalars act from right, and L(Ui) denotes the lattice of subspaces of Ui, and L(V) denotes the lattice of R-submodules of V.

Let W = V1  ×  V2  ×    ·    ·    ·    ×  Vr where Vi = niTi, so that [formula] It follows from [\ref=4.1] that the submodules of W are of the form A1  ×  A2  ×    ·    ·    ·    ×  Ar where Ai  ≤  Vi for each i. The result follows from [\ref=6.2].

The number in part (2) of [\ref=6.4] is equal to the cardinality of the set HomR(V / U,U). Indeed, a more general result is true. Suppose W is an R-module which is not necessarily semisimple and A be an R-submodule of W. If A has a complement in W, then it is easy to see by applying [\ref=4.1] that there is a bijection between the set of complements of A in W and the hom set HomR(W / A,A).

We have the following obvious consequence of [\ref=6.4].

Let V be a semisimple R-module of composition length n where n is a natural number. For any nonnegative integer i  ≤  n, let μi be the number of R-submodules of V of composition length i. Let U be an R-submodule of V. Then:

Let k be a natural number and L be a finite modular lattice. It is shown in [\cite=Dil] that the number of elements of L covered by precisely k elements is equal to the number of elements of L covering precisely k elements. The submodule lattice of (any module) V is modular, and if we assume further that V is semisimple, then, for k = 1, this result shows that the number of simple submodules of V is equal to the number of maximal submodules of V, i.e., μ1  =  μn - 1 with the notations of [\ref=6.5]. On the other hand, let D be a finite modular complemented lattice. By the length of an element x in D we mean the length of the largest chain between the smallest element of D and x. Let the length of the greatest element of D be n. Then, [\ref=6.5] prompts us to ask: Is it true that the number of elements of D of length k is equal to the number of elements of D of length n - k? An affirmative answer implies part (1) of [\ref=6.5]. One may ask a similar question for D suggested by part (2) of [\ref=6.5].

Let U be an n dimensional vector space over a finite field [formula] with q elements. Let S(U) denote the set of all subspaces of U, and let Si(U) denote the set of all i dimensional subspaces of U where 0  ≤  i  ≤  n. Then:

By using part (1) of [\ref=6.2] and [\ref=4.1] we lift the previous result to semisimple modules as follows, and we will use it in the next section where we study colorings.

Let V be a semisimple R-module isomorphic to

[formula]

where r is a natural number, T1,T2,...,Tr are mutually nonisomorphic simple R-modules, and n1,n2,...,nr are natural numbers. Assume that, for any natural number i with 1  ≤  i  ≤  r, if ni  ≥  2 then di = |EndR(Ti)| is finite. Let S(V) denote the set of all R-submodules of V, and let Sj(V) denote the set of all R-submodules of V of composition length j where j is a nonnegative integer. Let n = n1 + n2  +    ·    ·    ·  nr. Then:

Let S( ) denote the set of all submodules of its argument, and let Sj( ) denote the set of all submodules of its argument of composition length j.

(1) Let Vi = niTi. From part (1) of [\ref=6.2] and [\ref=6.6], there is a bijection φi:S(Vi)  →  S(Vi) such that [formula] and X + φi(X) = Vi for any X∈S(Vi). Let W = V1  ×  V2  ×    ·    ·    ·    ×  Vr so that [formula] It follows from [\ref=4.1] that

[formula]

Then, φ1  ×  φ2  ×    ·    ·    ·    ×  φr:S(W)  →  S(W) is a bijection satisfying the required property for all X∈S(W). The result follows because V and W are isomorphic modules.

(2) Without loss of generality assume that n1 is odd. Write W = V1  ×  V' where V1 = n1T1 and [formula] so that [formula] From [\ref=4.1],

[formula]

where i is ranging in nonnegative integers such that 0  ≤  i  ≤  n1 and 0  ≤  k - i  ≤  2k - n1, (so that max (n1 - k,0)  ≤  i  ≤   min (n1,k1)), and where [formula] denotes the disjoint union. To simplify the notations let Pi  =  Si(V1)  ×  Sk - i(V'). We have two possibilities: k  ≥  n1 or k < n1. Assume first that k  ≥  n1 so that 0  ≤  i  ≤  n1. Letting n1 = 2s - 1 for some natural number s, we now define

[formula]

Thus, [formula] Let 0  ≤  m  ≤  s - 1 be a natural number. It follows from part (1) that there are bijections

[formula]

such that [formula] and X + η(X) = V1 for any X∈Sm(V1), and

[formula]

such that [formula] and Y + θ(Y) = V' for any Y∈Sk - m(V'). Then,

[formula]

is a bijection satisfying the required condition. The collection of the maps [formula] for each m gives a bijection A  →  B satisfying the required condition. The result follows because the posets Sk(W) and Sk(V) are isomorphic. The case in which k < n1 may be handled similarly.

(3) Similar to the proof of part (2).

Coloring

In this section we study the chromatic number of G(V). The chromatic number of G(V) is already studied in [\cite=Jaf2] in the special case where R is a finite field and V is an odd dimensional vector space over R. Therefore, some of our results generalize these special results.

Let G be a graph. The chromatic number of G is defined to be the smallest number of colors χ(G) needed to color the vertices of G so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. Whenever we mention about to color a graph or a coloring of a graph we assume that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. See, for instance, [\cite=West] for finite graphs, and [\cite=Ore] for infinite graphs. The smallest number of colors in the above definition may not make sense, when the graph has infinitely many vertices and it cannot be colored by finitely many colors.

We first understand when G(V) can be colored by finitely many colors.

Suppose that G(V) can be colored by finitely many colors. Part (c) is obvious, because G(Soc(V)) is an induced subgraph of G(V) meaning that, for any two vertices of G(Soc(V)), they are adjacent in G(Soc(V)) if and only if they are adjacent in G(V).

It is clear that V cannot have an infinite ascending or descending chain of submodules, because, otherwise, the proper submodules appearing in such a chain will be mutually adjacent vertices of the graph G(V). Hence, (a) follows.

Part (b) is trivial. Otherwise, for any natural number n, there is a simple module S such that V / S has at least n + 1 submodules, implying that there are at least n proper submodules of V containing S. These n submodules are mutually adjacent vertices of G(V) so that χ(G(V))  ≥  n - 1 for any n.

For the rest we assume that (a)-(c) hold. In particular, V has a (finite) composition series, and so [formula] for any nonzero submodule U of V.

Let P(V) be the set of proper submodules of V. We define three sets:

[formula]

[formula]

so that P(V) is the disjoint union [formula]

We now want to show that χ(G(V)) has the desired upper bound. Firstly, as [formula] for any elements X and Y of A, we need to use at least |A| colors in any coloring of G(V). Moreover, as any element of B is adjacent to every element of A, to color the vertices in B we cannot use the colors that are already used to color the vertices in A. Thus, we need at least |A| + χ(G(Soc(V))) colors to color the vertices in [formula] and we can color the vertices in [formula] by using |A| + χ(G(Soc(V))) colors, where, of course, |A| = m - 1.

We will show that the vertices in C can be colored by using [formula] colors which proves the desired upper bound for χ(G(V)).

For any elements Y1 and Y2 of C, it is clear that Soc(Yi)∈B, and we see that [formula] if and only if [formula] (because, [formula] implies [formula]). That is to say, Y1 and Y2 are adjacent vertices of G(V) if and only if either Soc(Y1) and Soc(Y2) are equal or they are adjacent vertices of G(Soc(V)).

Define a relation ~   on C as follows: Y1  ~  Y2 if and only if Soc(Y1) = Soc(Y2). Then, it is obvious that ~   is an equivalence relation whose equivalence classes are precisely the sets

[formula]

where U is ranging in the vertex set of [formula] Moreover, C is the disjoint union of equivalence classes. Since any element in an equivalence class CU contains U, part (b) implies that |CU|  ≤  n - 2. For the same reason, the elements in a single equivalence class CU are mutually adjacent vertices in G(V), an so we can color CU by using n - 2 colors. Furthermore, it follows from the previous paragraph that, for any two distinct equivalence classes CU and CU', there is an element Z∈CU and an element Z'∈CU' such that [formula] if and only if U and U' are adjacent vertices of [formula] Consequently, we may color the vertices in C by using [formula] colors.

Finally, we want to observe that if (a)-(c) hold then χ(G(V)) is finite. Indeed, if (a)-(c) hold, then we have just proved that χ(G(V)) has the mentioned upper bound in this result. As [formula] (b) and (c) imply that this upper bound is a finite number.

For lower bounds we state.

Assume that G(V) can be colored by finitely many colors. Then, for any proper R-submodule W of V, G(W) can be colored by finitely many colors, and

[formula]

where m is the number of R-submodules of V / W.

Let P(V) be the set of proper submodules of V. Take any W∈P(V). It is clear that G(W) can be colored by finitely many colors, because G(W) is an induced subgraph of G(V). Moreover, part (a) of [\ref=7.1] implies that there is a simple submodule of W, and so part (b) of [\ref=7.1] implies that the number of submodules of V / W is finite. Define the sets

[formula]

Imitating the relevant part of the proof of [\ref=7.1] we easily see that we need at least |A| + χ(G(W)) colors to color the vertices of G(V) in [formula] finishing the proof.

By using [\ref=5.3] and [\ref=7.1] we can find examples of modules V such that G(V) can be colored by finitely many colors and it has infinitely many vertices and edges. For instance, an R-module V satisfying [formula] and [formula] where S and T are nonisomorphic simple R-modules and |EndR(S)| is infinite.

We now specialize in semisimple modules.

Let V be a semisimple R-module isomorphic to

[formula]

where r is a natural number, T1,T2,...,Tr are mutually nonisomorphic simple R-modules, and n1,n2,...,nr are natural numbers.

(1) If n1  ≤  2, then any nonzero submodule of V is simple so that G(V) has no edges. So, in this case G(V) can be colored by a single color.

Assume now that n1  ≥  3. Suppose that G(V) can be colored by finitely many colors. Part (b) of [\ref=7.1] implies that (n1 - 1)T1 has finitely many submodules. Then, as n1 - 1  ≥  2, it follows from [\ref=5.3] that |EndR(T1)| is finite.

Conversely, if n1  ≥  3 and |EndR(T1)| is finite, then [\ref=5.3] implies that G(V) has finitely many vertices.

(2) (ii) [formula] (iii): Follows from [\ref=5.3].

(ii) [formula] (i): Obvious.

(i) [formula] (ii): Follows from part (b) of [\ref=7.1] and [\ref=5.3].

Suppose that V is a semisimple R-module having a (finite) composition series and that V is not isomorphic to [formula] for any simple R-module S. We see in the above result that G(V) can be colored by finitely many vertices if and only if G(V) has finitely many vertices.

The results [\ref=7.1] and [\ref=7.3] complete the description of the structure of V for which G(V) can be colored by finitely many colors.

Let V be an R-module having a composition series of length n where n is a natural number. For any nonnegative integer i  ≤  n, let Si(V) denote the set of all R-submodules of V of composition length i. Let k be a natural number. Then:

Let [formula] denote the composition length of its argument. This is obvious, because, for any two submodules A and B of V, if [formula] then [formula] (If it is not obvious, see, for instance, [\cite=Warf]).

We finally proceed to obtain the chromatic number of a semisimple module. We first need a simple observation.

Let V be a semisimple R-module having a composition series of length 2k where k is a natural number. Suppose that there is a simple R-module whose multiplicity as a composition factor of V is odd. Then, given any three R-submodules W1,W2,W3 of V of composition length k, at least one of the three intersection

[formula]

is nonzero.

Otherwise, there are submodules W1,W2,W3 of V of composition length k such that [formula] and hence [formula] for any i,j with i  ≠  j. Now, we have the following isomorphisms of modules:

[formula]

But then, [formula] implies that the multiplicity of any simple module as a composition factor of V is even.

(1) Follows from [\ref=7.3].

(2) Let us define E and F as

[formula]

Note that the set of vertices in G(V) is the disjoint union [formula] It follows from part (1) of [\ref=7.4] that the vertices in E are mutually adjacent. So, in any coloring of G(V), the vertices in E must be colored by using mutually different colors. We want to show that the vertices in F can be colored by using the colors that are used to color the vertices in E. This will imply that the chromatic number of G is |E|, which finishes the proof.

From part (1) of [\ref=6.7], for any nonnegative integer j  ≤  n, there is a bijection

[formula]

such that [formula] for any X∈Sj(V). Then, these maps induce the bijection

[formula]

such that [formula] for any Y in E. Hence, for any vertex Z in F, we may color Z by using the same color of the vertex φ- 1(Z) in E, where φ- 1 denotes the inverse of φ.

Suppose we have colored the vertices as we explained. We want to observe that no two adjacent vertices are colored by the same color. Take any two vertices Z1 and Z2 of G(V) whose colors are the same. It is clear that exactly one of Z1 and Z2 must be in E, say Z1∈E and Z2∈F. Then, φ- 1(Z2) and Z1 are both in E and their colors are the same. As the vertices in E are colored by using mutually different colors, φ- 1(Z2) = Z1, implying that [formula]

(3) Let us define E' and F' as follows:

[formula]

Note that the set of vertices in G(V) is the disjoint union [formula] Arguing as in the proof of the previous part, we see that the vertices in [formula] can be colored by |E'| colors, and |E'| is the smallest possible number of colors to be used to color the vertices in [formula] and the vertices in E' are colored by mutually different colors. It follows from part (2) of [\ref=7.4] that any arbitrarily chosen vertex in Sk(V) is adjacent to every vertex in E'. To color the vertices in Sk(V) we must use colors that are not already used to color the vertices in [formula] Hence, to finish the proof we should show that the smallest number of colors to color the vertices in Sk(V) is [formula]

From part (2) of [\ref=6.7], there are disjoint sets A and B and a bijection α:A  →  B such that [formula] and [formula] for any X∈A. Let |A| = m for some natural number m, so Sk(V) = 2m.

We now want to show that to color the vertices in Sk(V) we need at least m colors. Indeed, suppose for a moment that, it is possible to color all the 2m vertices in Sk(V) by using less than m colors. Then there must be at least three vertices with the same color. However, this is not possible by the virtue of [\ref=7.5].

We finally want to show that we can color the vertices in Sk(V) by using m colors. Indeed, we may write Sk(V) as a disjoint union

[formula]

Let {UX:X∈A} be a set of m mutually distinct colors indexed by the elements of A. It is now clear that we can color the vertices in Sk(V) by m colors, by insisting that, for each X∈A, the colors of the two vertices in {X,α(X)} are the same which is UX.

The previous result does not cover the case in which all of the numbers n,n1,n2,...,nr are even. We do not know what the chromatic number is in this case. The cardinalities Si(V) appeared in the previous result can be calculated by using [\ref=6.4].

Planarity

A graph is called planar if it can be drawn on the plane in such a way that its edges intersect only at their endpoints. See, for instance, [\cite=West] or [\cite=Ore]. The planarity of intersection graphs of ideals of a commutative ring is studied in [\cite=Jaf3]. We devote this section to the determination of the structure of the modules whose intersection graphs are planar. We have no restrictions on the module V and the ring R so that some of our results generalize the known results in the special cases.

For any natural number n we denote by Kn the complete graph on n vertices, which is not planar for n  ≥  5, see [\cite=West]. If a graph G has a subgraph isomorphic to Kn, then we say that G contains K5. Thus, G does not contain Kn if and only if there are no mutually adjacent n vertices in G.

If G(V) does not contain Kn, then V has a composition series of length less than or equal to n.

This is obvious, because the subgraph of G(V) induced by the proper submodules of V appearing in any ascending or descending chain of submodules of V is a complete graph.

Let V be an R-module having a composition series of length m where m  ≥  3 is a natural number. Suppose that G(V) does not contain Kn. Then:

(1) As V is not semisimple and has a (finite) composition series, the Jacobson radical Jac(V) of V is not zero. Suppose for a moment that there are at least n - m + 2 maximal submodules. Let M be the set of all maximal submodules of V. Let N be the set of all proper submodules of V appearing in a composition series of V which contains Jac(V) as one of its term. Therefore, N is a chain with respect to the subset or equal to relation, |N| = m - 1, Jac(V)∈N, and [formula] Since Jac(V) is the intersection of all the maximal submodules of V, the intersection of any two elements of the set [formula] is nonzero. This implies that G(V) contains Kn, because [formula] and so

[formula]

(2) We argue as in the previous part. Let M be the set of all maximal submodules of V, and N be the set of all proper submodules of V appearing in a composition series C of V. Suppose that the conclusion is false. Then, V has at least n - m + 3 maximal submodules. We cannot deduce that the intersection of any two elements of the set [formula] is nonzero, because Jac(V) = 0 here. However, as m > 2, given any maximal submodule of V and any nonsimple submodule of V, the sum of their composition lengths is greater than m, so that their intersection is nonzero. Therefore, we deduce that the intersection of any two elements of the set [formula] is nonzero, where W is the (unique) simple module appearing in the chain C. As [formula] we see that [formula] implying that G(V) contains Kn.

(3) Suppose that V is semisimple. As V has a composition series of length m, the semisimplicity of V implies that V has at least m maximal submodules. (If it is not obvious, see [\ref=5.2], or write V as a direct sum of m simple submodules, say S1,S2,...,Sm, and then letting, Mi be the sum of all simple modules S1,S2,...,Sm except Si, we see that M1,M2,...,Mm are mutually distinct m maximal submodules). By part (2) we should have m  ≤  n - m + 2.

In the rest of this section, we will frequently mention about the length of a composition series and the number of maximal submodules of a module. To simplify the reading we develop some notations. Let W be an R-module having a (finite) composition series. We sometimes use the notations [formula] and [formula] to denote the composition length of W and the number of maximal R-submodules of W, respectively. Moreover, for any nonnegative integer n and any R-module U, by writing [formula] we claim that U has a composition series of length n.

We may restate [\ref=3.2] as follows.

Suppose that G(V) does not contain K4. We know from [\ref=8.1] that [formula] We now want to understand what happens at each possible value for [formula]

Assume that [formula]

(b) follows from [\ref=8.2]. Assume now that V is semisimple, so that [formula] for some simple R-modules Si. Then [\ref=8.2] implies that [formula] If any two of S1,S2,S3 are isomorphic, it follows from [\ref=5.2] that [formula] Thus, (c) follows.

Assume that [formula]

Any semisimple module of composition length 4 has at least 4 maximal submodules. (See [\ref=5.2], or the proof of part (3) of [\ref=8.2]). Thus, [\ref=8.2] implies that V is not semisimple and V has a unique maximal submodule, say J. This shows that the proper submodules of V are precisely J and the proper submodules of J. Hence, G(J) must not contain K3 (because, otherwise the vertices of K3 in G(J) and J form K4 in G(V)). As [formula] it follows from [\ref=8.3] that [formula] Thus, (d) follows.

Conversely, we want to observe that for any module V, satisfying any of the conditions (a)-(d), the graph G(V) does not contain K4.

It is clear that if V satisfies (a) then G(V) has no edges.

Moreover, if V satisfies (b) or (d), then it is obvious that V has at most 2 nonsimple proper submodules. As the intersection of any two distinct simple modules is zero, this shows that G(V) does not contain K4.

Finally, suppose that V satisfies (c). By using [\ref=4.1] or [\ref=6.4], we see that V has 3 maximal submodules and 3 simple submodules. So G(V) does not contain K4, because there are no edges between simple submodules and the intersection of all maximal submodules is zero.

We argue as in the proof [\ref=8.4]. Suppose that G(V) does not contain K5. Then, [formula] from [\ref=8.1]. We now want to understand what happens at each possible value for [formula]

Assume that [formula]

(b) is an easy consequence of [\ref=8.2].

Assume that V is semisimple, so that [formula] for some simple R-modules Si. Now [\ref=8.2] implies that [formula] Let d = |EndR(S1)|. By using [\ref=5.2] we calculate [formula] as:

[formula]

Thus, (c) and (d) follow because the smallest possible value for d is 2 (being a division ring, if EndR(S1) is finite then it must be a finite field).

Assume that [formula]

From [\ref=8.2] we conclude that V is not semisimple and [formula] So, [formula] or [formula] Suppose first that [formula] Then, V has a unique maximal submodule J, which must contain every proper submodule of V. As G(V) does not contain K5, we see that G(J) cannot contain K4. Hence, (e) and (f) follows from [\ref=8.4]. Note that the module J in (e) is necessarily nonsemisimple.

Suppose now that [formula] Then, V has exactly two maximal submodules, say J and J'. We will show that [formula] Suppose for a moment that J has two maximal submodules X and Y. Considering the composition lengths, if [formula] then the vertices in the set

[formula]

form K5 in G(V). On the other hand, if [formula] then the vertices in the set

[formula]

form K5 in G(V). Hence, [formula] (and similarly [formula]). Consequently, (g) follows.

Assume that [formula]

It follows from [\ref=8.2] that V has a unique maximal submodule J1. As every proper submodule of V is contained in J1, the graph G(J1) cannot contain K4. Then, as [formula] (h) follows from [\ref=8.4].

Conversely, we need to observe that G(V) does not contain K5 for any V satisfying any of the conditions (a)-(h). However, this is easy to see because the conditions (a)-(h) give enough information to draw the graphs G(V) in each cases. More than this, we actually see that G(V) are planar in each of the conditions (a)-(h)

If G(V) is planar, then G(V) does not contain K5, and so V satisfies one of the conditions in the above result. On the other hand, in each of the conditions (a)-(h) above, it is easy to draw G(V) and observe that G(V) is planar. Thus we have the following result.

G(V) is planar if and only if V satisfies one of the conditions (a)-(h) given in [\ref=8.5].
