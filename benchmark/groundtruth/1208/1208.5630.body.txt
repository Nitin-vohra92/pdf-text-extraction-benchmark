Current situation of the flavour data

With the start of the LHCb experiment a new era in precision measurements in flavour physics started. The present 95% C.L. upper bound B(Bs  →  μ+μ-)  ≤  4.5  ·  10- 9 [\cite=Aaij:2012ac] is already close to the Standard model (SM) prediction [formula] [\cite=Buras:2012ts] [\cite=LHCb:2012py]. When the corrections from ΔΓs, pointed out in [\cite=deBruyn:2012wj] [\cite=deBruyn:2012wk] are taken into account the experimental upper bound is reduced to 4.1  ·  10- 9. New data on mixing induced CP violation in [formula] mixing measured by Sψφ  =  0.002  ±  0.0087 [\cite=Clarke:1429149] is consistent with the SM prediction of [formula] and excludes ranges from CDF and DØ with large Sψφ. Thus there is not much room left for new physics (NP). The experimental situation is displayed in Fig. [\ref=fig:LHCbdata].

However a slight tension in the flavour data concerns |εK|, B+  →  τ+ν and SψKS which can be related with the so-called |Vub|-problem. In the SM SψKS measures the angle β of the unitarity triangle directly: SψKS  =   sin 2β. Due to [formula] both quantities are correlated in the SM (but the |Vcb|4 dependence leads to additional uncertainties). This issue was discussed in [\cite=Lunghi:2008aa] [\cite=Buras:2008nn] and a 3.2σ discrepancy was identified in 2008. However this tension went down to about 2σ. In Fig. [\ref=fig:sin2beta] one can see that the [formula] derived from the experimental value SψKS is much smaller that the one derived from |εK|. The "true" value of β - the angle opposite of the |Vub|-side of the unitarity triangle - depends on the value of |Vub| and γ. However there is a tension between the exclusive and inclusive determinations of |Vub| [\cite=Nakamura:2010zzi]:

[formula]

Now one can distinguish between these two benchmark scenarios: If one uses the exclusive (small) value of |Vub| to derive [formula] and then calculates [formula] one finds agreement with the data whereas |εK| stays below the data. Using the inclusive (large) |Vub| as input for [formula] the predicted SψKS is above the measurements while |εK| is in agreement with the data. However in such considerations one has to keep in mind the error on |εK| coming dominantly from the error of |Vcb| and the error of the QCD factor η1 in the charm contribution [\cite=Brod:2011ty].

The branching ratio [formula] can also be used to measure |Vub|. The SM prediction B(B+  →  τ+ν)SM  =  (0.80  ±  0.12)  ·  10- 4 as calculated in [\cite=Altmannshofer:2009ne] where one eliminates the uncertainties of FB+ and |Vub| by using ΔMd, ΔMd  /  ΔMs and SψKS is about a factor 2 below the experimental world average based on results by BaBar [\cite=Aubert:2009wt] and Belle [\cite=Ikado:2006un]: B(B+  →  τ+ν) exp  =  (1.67  ±  0.30)  ·  10- 4 [\cite=HFAG]. Consequently this favors a large |Vub| and leads to a SψKS  -  B(B+  →  τ+ν) tension discussed for example in [\cite=Nierste:2011na]. Recently new results have been provided by BaBar B(B+  →  τ+ν) exp  =  (1.79  ±  0.48)  ·  10- 4 [\cite=Lees:2012ju] and by Belle B(B+  →  τ+ν) exp  =  (0.72  ±  0.270.25  ±  0.460.51)  ·  10- 4 [\cite=Adachi:2012mm] where the latter value went down and is consistent with the SM prediction.

It is now interesting to see if a certain new physics model can solve these problems and if yes, which |Vub| scenario is chosen. In the following we will confront constraint minimal flavour violation (CMFV) and models with a global U(2)3 symmetry to this tension. At the end we discuss a concrete SO(10) SUSY GUT model which has a different flavour structure and can be seen as an alternative to MFV.

Correlations of ΔF  =  2 observables: CMFV vs. MU(2)3 and the role of |Vub|

The great success of the Cabibbo Kobayashi Maskawa mechanism puts strong constraints on the flavour structure of NP models. A very simple extension of the SM is CMFV, where the CKM matrix is the only source of flavour and CP violation and only SM operators are relevant below the electroweak scale. Phenomenological consequences of CMFV concerning ΔF  =  2 observables are the following:

Since there are no new CP violating phases the mixing induced CP asymmetries stay as in the SM:

[formula]

ΔMs,d and |εK| can only be enhanced relative to the SM and this enhancement is correlated [\cite=Blanke:2006yh] [\cite=Buras:2000xq].

CMFV chooses exclusive |Vub| because SψKS stays as in the SM and |εK| can be enhanced. But if one wants to solve the |εK| - SψKS tension one gets a problem with ΔMs,d. This ΔMs,d - |εK| tension is shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:DeltaMvsepsKv2].

Consequently, the solution of the |εK| - SψKS tension in CMFV shifts the problem to ΔMs,d. Models with a global U(2)3 flavour symmetry represent simple non-MFV extensions of the SM and can help avoiding this ΔMs,d - |εK| tension of CMFV. In these U(2)3 models the stringent correlations between flavour observables in CMFV are relaxed as the third generation is treated differently without loosing too much of its predictive capability. The U(2)3 symmetry was first studied in [\cite=Pomarol:1995xc] [\cite=Barbieri:1995uv] and then in [\cite=Barbieri:2011ci] [\cite=Barbieri:2011fc] [\cite=Barbieri:2012uh] [\cite=Barbieri:2012bh] [\cite=Crivellin:2011fb] [\cite=Crivellin:2011sj] [\cite=Crivellin:2008mq] where a detailed description of the model can be found. In a minimal version of this model the global flavour symmetry GF  =  U(2)Q  ×  U(2)u  ×  U(2)d (short: U(2)3) is broken minimally by three spurions

[formula]

This symmetry can be motivated by the observed pattern of quark masses and mixings which cannot be explained in MFV models based on a U(3)3 symmetry. A nice feature of U(2)3 is that one can easily embed Supersymmetry (SUSY) with heavy 1[formula]/2[formula] sfermion generation and a light 3[formula] generation which is still consistent with current collider bounds on sparticle masses. For more details of the model see the talk by Filippo Sala during this workshop [\cite=Salatalk]. General consequences of U(2)3 and the breaking pattern in ([\ref=equ:breakingpattern]) concerning ΔF  =  2 observables are the following:

The flavour structure in the K-meson system is governed by MFV (no new phase φK).

Corrections in Bd,s system are proportional to the CKM structure of the SM and they are universal: CBd  =  CBs = :rB.

There exists one new universal phase that only appears in Bd,s system: [formula].

If we further assume that only SM operators are relevant we call it minimal U(2)3: MU(2)3. These properties lead to the following equations describing ΔF  =  2 observables where only three new parameters appear

[formula]

The parameters rK,B are real and positive definite and further rK  ≥  1. In contrast to CMFV rB and rK are in principle unrelated. However in concrete realizations of the model, e.g. SUSY they are correlated since they both depend on SUSY masses. In [\cite=Buras:2012sd] we point out a triple SψKS - Sψφ - |Vub| correlation which will provide a crucial test of the MU(2)3 scenario once the three observables will be precisely known. This is shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:SvsS] for fixed [formula]. Varying γ between [formula] and [formula] does not change the result significantly. Negative Sψφ is for example only possible for small |Vub| in the ballpark of the exclusive value. For inclusive |Vub|, Sψφ is always larger than the SM prediction. MU(2)3 models that are consistent with this correlation should also describe the data for |εK| and ΔMd,s. For example for Sψφ < 0 the particular MU(2)3 model must provide a 25% enhancement of |εK| (see Fig. [\ref=fig:epsK1] left plot). Moreover, if this MU(2)3 flavour symmetry turns out to be true one can determine |Vub| by means of precise measurements of SψKS and Sψφ with small hadronic uncertainties.

The dependence of |εK| (only central values) on |Vub| for different values of rK is shown in the left plot of Fig. [\ref=fig:epsK1]. Here we can read off that for a low value of |Vub| an enhancement of |εK| is needed. Fixing SψKS = 0.679 to its central experimental value we can use the triple correlation to get the connection between |εK| and Sψφ which is shown in the right plot of Fig. [\ref=fig:epsK1]. Thus we see that even in MU(2)3 models correlations between B- and K-physics are possible.

SO(10) SUSY GUT: CMM model

In an SO(10) SUSY GUT model proposed by Chang, Masiero and Murayama [\cite=Chang:2002mq] and also by Moroi [\cite=Moroi:2000tk] the neutrino mixing matrix [formula] is transfered to the right-handed down quark and charged lepton sector which can induced additional flavour violation at an observable level. In [\cite=Girrbach:2011an] we have performed a global analysis in the CMM model including an extensive renormalization group (RG) analysis to connect Planck-scale and low-energy parameters. A short summary of this work can also be found in [\cite=Buras:2012ts] [\cite=Girrbach:2011wt] [\cite=Nierste:2011na]. In view of the new knowledge about the Higgs mass and the latest measurements of the reactor neutrino mixing angle θ13 an updated analysis of this model would be desirable.

Flavour structure

The basic ingredient of the flavour structure of the CMM model is that not only the neutrinos are rotated with [formula] but the whole [formula]-plets of SU(5) [formula]. Whereas mixing of right-handed quark fields in flavour space is unphysical it is not for the corresponding superfields due to the soft breaking terms. Consequently the large atmospheric neutrino mixing angle [formula] is responsible for large R  -  s̃R- and L  -  L-mixing which can then induce b  →  s and τ  →  μ transitions via SUSY loops. For a more detailed derivation starting from an SO(10) superpotential see [\cite=Girrbach:2011an]. In a weak basis with diagonal up-type Yukawa matrix we have

[formula]

and the right-handed down squark mass matrix at the low scale reads

[formula]

where Δd̃∈[0,  1] defines the relative mass splitting between the 1[formula]/2[formula] and 3[formula] down-squark generation. It is generated by RG effects of the top Yukawa coupling and can reach 0.4. Thus the CMM model shares the feature of U(2)3 models of heavy 1[formula]/2[formula] squark generations but a light 3[formula] generation. If we rotate to mass eigenstate basis and diagonalize [formula] the neutrino mixing enters m2D̃:

[formula]

Consequently, the 23-entry [formula] is responsible for R  -  s̃R-mixing and a new CP violating phase ξ enters that affects [formula]-mixing. The "≈  " sign in ([\ref=equ:msquark]) gets a "=  " if one uses tribimaximal mixing in [formula]. However, the latest data show that the reactor neutrino mixing angle θ13 is indeed non-zero [\cite=Abe:2011fz] [\cite=An:2012eh] [\cite=Ahn:2012nd]. Including θ13  ≠   the 12- and 13-entry in ([\ref=equ:msquark]) are no longer zero, but still much smaller than the 23-entry. This gives small corrections to [formula]- and [formula]-mixing.

Phenomenology

Four our global flavour analysis only seven parameters of the CMM model are relevant: the universal scalar soft mass m0 and trilinear coupling a0 at the Planck scale, the gluino mass [formula], the D-term mass splitting D, the phase of μ, the phase ξ and tan β (but the range [formula] follows from the superpotential and the requirement of perturbative couplings up to the Planck scale). Similar to the constrained MSSM, the CMM model shares the nice feature of having only a few model parameters, however the flavour structure is different: In the CMM model flavour universality is present at [formula] but already broken at [formula] and hadronic and leptonic observables are correlated due to GUT boundary conditions.

Flavour processes where we expect large CMM contributions are [formula] mixing, b  →  sγ and τ  →  μγ since here the neutrino mixing angle [formula] connects the 2[formula] and 3[formula] generation. CMM effects in B(Bs  →  μ+μ-) are however small because at the electroweak scale the CMM model is a special version of the MSSM with small tan β. Consequently the CMM model is still compatible with new LHCb bound. Due to the structure of ([\ref=equ:msquark]) the contributions to [formula] mixing, [formula] mixing and μ  →  eγ are absent. However there are two sources of small corrections: a non-vanishing θ13 as already mentioned and corrections due to dimension-5-Yukawa terms that are needed to fix [formula] for the 1[formula] and 2[formula] second generation. The latter point was worked out in [\cite=Trine:2009ns]. In [\cite=Trine:2009ns] it was also shown that the tension in the SM between [formula] predicted from |εK| and ΔMs  /  ΔMd, and its direct measurement from SψKS can be removed with the help of higher-dimensional Yukawa couplings.

Results from our global analysis are the following: τ  →  μγ constrains the sfermion masses of the first two generations to lie above 1 TeV while the third generation can be much lighter. The sfermion masses can also be constrained by b  →  sγ but τ  →  μγ gives stronger bounds. Gauginos can still be lighter. The lightest supersymmetric particle is in most of the CMM parameter space the lightest neutralino with masses of O(100) ~ GeV. Concerning [formula] mixing the situation shifted after the LHCb data for Sψφ. Due to the free phase ξ it is possible to get large CP violation in the Bs system in the CMM model while at the same time ΔMs stays within its experimental range. In view of the data from CDF and DØ on Sψφ this property was very welcomed in 2010. The new data on Sψφ implies new constraints on the model parameters, especially on ξ and on the ratio of gluino and squark masses [formula] which must now be smaller than before. This was exemplarily shown in [\cite=Buras:2012ts]. Consequently one previous advantage of the CMM model over the constrained MSSM - the ability to generate a large Sψφ - is now gone.

Another observable that needs further investigation is the Higgs mass. In the CMM model the mass of the lightest neutral Higgs is very sensitive to tan β. Decreasing tan β also decreases the Higgs mass because a larger top yukawa coupling increases the mass splitting Δd̃ in the renormalization group running which leads to smaller stop masses. Therefore the correction to the tree level Higgs mass in the MSSM gets smaller. In [\cite=Girrbach:2011an] we pointed out that tan β  =  3 is already excluded because in the regions where all flavour constraints are fulfilled the lightest Higgs mass exceeds the LEP bound. For tan β  =  6 the Higgs mass can be up to 120 GeV in the parameter range consistent with flavour observables. Consequently one has to increase tan β further to accommodate a Higgs mass of 125 GeV.

Summary

In the first part we studied and compared correlations of ΔF  =  2 observables in CMFV and in a minimal version of models with an approximate global U(2)3 flavour symmetry. These MU(2)3 models are very simple non-MFV extensions of the SM that avoid the ΔMs,d  -  εK tension present in CMFV. We pointed out a triple correlation between Sψφ, SψKS and |Vub| that constitutes an important test for MU(2)3 models. A negative Sψφ could still be accommodated if the exclusive value of |Vub| turns out to be true. However than an 25% enhancement in |εK| is needed. In the last part a concrete SO(10) SUSY GUT model, the CMM model was under consideration. Instead of a written summary of the CMM model I refer to Fig. [\ref=fig:CMMUhr] where the most important facts are listed.
