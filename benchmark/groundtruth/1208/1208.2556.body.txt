On the nonexistence of cycles for the Collatz function

Introduction

The Collatz function is defined as

[formula]

The definition for i iterations is

[formula]

The Collatz conjecture or 3n + 1 problem says that [formula]. The sequence which is generated by Ci(n) is the trajectory of n.  [\cite=LGX] [\cite=LGY] An example is the trajectory [formula] for n = 13. As we can observe this trajectory ends in a {4,2,1}-cycle. In general a cycle has a trajectory [formula] with C(mi) = m0. Before we come to the question if there is a cycle ≠  {4,2,1} for the Collatz function, we normalize every potential cycle by the definiton of a min-normal cycle

[formula]

This guarantees that the first is always the smallest element of the cycle. And then we have a unique representation for the same cycle.

Some preliminaries

We can derive other properties from such a min-normal cycle [formula]

m0 is odd

m0 has the form 2k + 1

m2 has the form 3k + 2

m2 is odd

[formula]

We can easily see that i) m0 is odd otherwise [formula] would be a contradiction to m0 is the smallest element. From i) directly follows ii). Then [formula] satisfies iii). iv) m2 is odd otherwise [formula] would be a contradiction to m0 is the smallest element. And v) follows from the cycle property itself that after |Mλ| iterations of the Collatz function the start element is reached again.

Every odd element mj with [formula] of any min-normal cycle [formula] can be expressed as [formula] where x is the number of odd elements and y is the number of even elements and [formula].

We know C|Mλ|(mj) = mj. We can calculate an odd element mj within x steps until mj is reached again. For each step one 3n + 1-operation and one or more [formula]-operations can be applied. It is obvious that the number of steps x is the number of odd elements because each 3n + 1-operation occurs per odd element. And y is the sum of even elements and also the sum of [formula]-operations for each step. Therefore every odd element mj can be expressed as [formula].

The idea of the main result is to prove that there exists no representation of the form [formula] for a min-normal cycle ≠  {1,4,2}. A part of the main result is also based on the following corollary.

3x + 1 = 2y has no solution for x > 1.

That 3x + 1 = 2y is not soluble for x > 1 follows directly from Mih ailescu's theorem  [\cite=MIH] which proved that 32 - 23 = 1 is the only nontrivial solution to Catalan's Diophantine problem xp - yq  =    ±  1.

Main result

There exists no min-normal cycle Mλ  ≠  {1,4,2} for the Collatz function.

Let there be a min-normal cycle [formula]. Then lemma [\ref=lem1] implies

[formula]

For odd m0 and m2, then

[formula]

Because m0 = 2k + 1, then

[formula]

And because m2 = 3k + 2, then

[formula]

The number of odd elements x and the number of even elements y are equal for [formula] and [formula] because it is the same cycle with the same number of odd and even elements. But then [formula] because there is only one solution for [formula]. That implies

[formula]

[formula]

It follows that the min-normal cycle Mλ satisfies (2z0 - z1) + k(3z0 - 2z1) = 0. Let z1 = 2z0 + n with [formula].

[formula]

Obviously [formula] and therefore we know that [formula]. Let z1 = 2z0 - n with [formula].

[formula]

So far we have shown that a solution satisfies (k + 1)n = k(z0 - n). From n = k(z0 - 2n) follows that [formula] and k|n. In the next steps we want to find the lower and upper bound for z0 in relation to n. Let z0 = 2n with [formula].

[formula]

Obviously [formula]. It follows z0 > 2n. Let z0 = 2n + 2 with [formula].

[formula]

Obviously [formula]. It follows z0 < 2n + 2. Therefore we know that z0 has a solution between 2n and 2n + 2, precisely 2n + 1. Let z0 = 2n + 1 with [formula].

[formula]

Obviously [formula] and solutions exist only for n = k. But then z0 = 2n + 1 = 2k + 1 = m0 and it follows

[formula]

From corollary [\ref=cor1] we know that there is no solution for x > 1. Actually the only solution is 31 + 1 = 22 which is the {1,4,2}-cycle with n = k = 0. Therefore there exists no min-normal cycle Mλ  ≠  {1,4,2}.
