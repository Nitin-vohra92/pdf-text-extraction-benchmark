Nonlinear terahertz metamaterials via field-enhanced carrier dynamics in GaAs

Nonlinear metamaterials is a rapidly developing field of fundamental interest with significant technological implications spanning from microwave through the visible spectral ranges [\cite=zharov03] [\cite=klein07] [\cite=bing08] [\cite=fang09] [\cite=poutrina10] [\cite=rose11a] [\cite=liu12]. As with tunable and reconfigurable metamaterials [\cite=chen06] [\cite=tao09], the combination of the metamaterial structure with the local environment is crucial. This is because significant nonlinearities result from local field enhancement within the active region of the subwavelength metamaterial elements which, in the case of split ring resonators, are the capacitive gaps. While the active volume of the enhanced gaps is small in comparison to the unit cell volume, the field enhancement can dominate volumetric effects leading to global nonlinearities enhanced by two to four orders of magnitude [\cite=poutrina10]. This, in turn, results in useful nonlinear effects at low incident fields.

Advances in nonlinear metamaterials coincide with the development of high-field terahertz sources capable of generating electric fields sufficient to induce significant nonlinearities in conventional matter [\cite=matthias09] [\cite=hebling10] [\cite=ic11] [\cite=tanaka11] [\cite=hirori11]. For example, in doped GaAs, highly nonlinear effects such as velocity saturation and impact ionization have been observed [\cite=hebling10] [\cite=hirori11] at peak electric fields of several hundred kV/cm. Further, with metamaterial THz field enhancement to MV/cm fields an insulator-metal phase transition has been induced in vanadium dioxide, a prototypical correlated electron material [\cite=liu12].

In this letter, we experimentally demonstrate a nonlinear response in metamaterial split ring resonators (SRRs) on n-type GaAs and semi-insulating (SI) GaAs at terahertz frequencies. The nonlinear response arises from THz electric field-induced carrier dynamics that increase or decrease the substrate conductivity upon which the SRR arrays are fabricated. This modifies the SRR electromagnetic response as a function of field strength. For peak incident THz fields (Ein) from ~  20-160 kV/cm, mobility saturation by intervalley scattering (IVS) dominates leading (for doped GaAs) to a conductivity decrease and a corresponding increase in the metamaterial oscillator strength. In this regime, electric field enhancement within the SRR capacitive gaps does not significantly contribute to the nonlinearity. That is, IVS occurs uniformly across the film independent of the SRRs. For Ein >   160 kV/cm, field enhancement in the gaps enables efficient carrier generation via impact ionization (IMI) resulting in a decrease in the SRR oscillator strength. It is possible to sweep the effective permittivity from negative to positive values by increasing the incident field strength enabling new possibilities for nonlinear metamaterials such as an intensity dependent effective refractive index. We also show that SRRs on semi-insulating GaAs exhibit a nonlinear response arising from an increase of the in-gap conductivity by several orders of magnitude.

To create nonlinear metamaterials, electric field resonant SRR arrays were fabricated by conventional microfabrication on GaAs. Fig. 1 (a) shows an SRR array on a 1.8-μm-thick doped ([formula]) GaAs film deposited on a SI-GaAs substrate using molecular-beam epitaxy. The SRRs consist of 200 nm thick Au with a 10 nm Cr adhesion layer. A narrow gap (g=2.2 μm) is important as the field enhancement scales as 1/g [\cite=werley12]. To characterize the linear electromagnetic (EM) response, electro-optic based terahertz time-domian (THz-TDS) spectroscopy was employed. To accurately measure the metamaterial transmission spectrum, a bare n-type GaAs substrate was used as a reference. Dividing the Fourier transform of the sample data by that of the reference data yields the transmission amplitude as a function of frequency as shown in Figure [\ref=Figure1](b). The LC resonance is ~   0.75 THz and is strongly damped, as expected, since carriers in the doped GaAs short the SRRs. The corresponding conductivity of doped GaAs is 7 (Ωcm)- 1.

For the nonlinear transmission measurements, high-field THz experiments were performed using tilted-pulse-front THz generation in LiNbO3 [\cite=yeh07]. We obtained a peak THz field strength of approximately 400 kV/cm, with a 1 mm beam diameter at the focus. The field strength could be varied from 24 kV/cm to 400 kV/cm using a pair of wire grid polarizers. The detailed experimental setup has been described elsewhere [\cite=hebling08] [\cite=matthias09]. All experiments were performed at room temperature in a dry air environment at ambient pressure.

Figure [\ref=Figure2](a) shows the experimentally measured transmission as a function of frequency for various values of Ein  ≤   160 kV/cm. At 24 kV/cm the transmission response is similar to the low-field (<  1 kV/cm) result shown in Fig. [\ref=Figure1](b) where a weak LC resonance is observed. As the incident field is increased to 160 kV/cm, the LC resonance becomes quite pronounced leading to a decrease in the resonant transmission(~   0.73 THz) from 65% to about 30%. This suggests a decrease in the conductivity which, as discussed below, results from a decrease in the carrier mobility due to THz-induced IVS. The off-resonance transmission at low frequencies increases (e.g. at 0.4 THz from 80% to over 90%). This indicates a field-induced reduction in the conductivity of the entire n-type GaAs film similar to other tunable metamaterial responses [\cite=driscoll08] [\cite=shen11] and consistent with earlier observation in bulk GaAs [\cite=hebling10]. Thus, for 24 ≤   Ein ≤   160 kV/cm the nonlinearity does not depend strongly on the in-gap field enhancement.

However above ~   160 kV/cm, the trend described above in the field-dependent transmission at the resonant frequency is exactly reversed as shown in Fig. 2(b): the transmission decreases with further increase in Ein. This indicates a reversal of the underlying trend in conductivity as well, i.e. an increase in conductivity in the gaps as the field is increased above 160 kV/cm. Notably, the off-resonance transmission at lower frequencies (<   0.5 THz) remains almost unchanged and implies a local conductivity increase solely in the capacitive gaps of the resonators. We ascribe this response to THz field-induced impact ionization.

To better understand how THz field-driven nonequilibrium carrier transport determines the nonlinear metamaterial response, we consider, in turn, IVS and IMI. For 24 ≤   Ein ≤   160 kV/cm, electrons in the conduction band (Γ valley) are accelerated and acquire energy on the order of 1 eV, sufficient for scattering into satellite valleys. Since the mobility in the side valleys is approximately one order of magnitude smaller than in the Γ valley [\cite=darrow92] [\cite=nuss87], IVS leads to a significant conductivity decrease in the n-type GaAs film. Independent of the SRR array, for doped substrates IVS results in photoinduced transparency [\cite=hebling10] [\cite=fhsu09] [\cite=allenAPL83] and accounts for the off-resonance transmission increase that is observed in Fig. 2(a). Of course, for the SRR arrays, this same process decreases the in-gap conductivity, resulting in an enhanced LC resonance.

IVS-induced enhancement of the metamaterial EM response was simulated using a commercial software, CST Microwave Studio. The n-type GaAs film was modeled utilizing a frequency dependent Drude model. We assume that the average mobility varies by changing the relative fraction of electrons in the Γ and L valleys and that at 160 kV/cm all of the conduction electrons are scattered to the L valley. Additionally, for fields ≤   160 kV/cm, we neglect IMI. That is, the carrier concentration is held constant at the doping value ([formula] cm- 3). The results of this mobility averaging procedure (applied to the entire film) determine the film conductivity used in the electromagnetic simulations. The results are shown in Fig. 2(c) and show good agreement with the experimental data in Fig. 2(a). Comparing these plots reveals that, for an incident field of 24 kV/cm, a mobility of 4200 cm2 / Vs (close to the reported value [\cite=katz92]) yields good agreement. If the majority of conduction electrons were scattered to the L valley, a mobility of 400 cm2 / Vs would result. The agreement between experiment and simulation suggests that at 160 kV/cm this a reasonable approximation.

Above 160 kV/cm, IMI becomes increasingly important. This is because the SRR resonance is strengthened from the IVS-induced conductivity decrease. At 160 kV/cm, simulations indicate in-gap electric field enhancement by a factor of ~  15 on resonance, corresponding to an overall peak electric field enhancement of ~   4 in the time domain. This is in good agreement with previously reported values [\cite=werley12]. Thus, with an incident field strength of 160 kV/cm, the in-gap field is estimated to be ~  0.64 MV/cm, which is sufficient for IMI in which THz-accelerated conduction band electrons collide with valance band electrons to result in carrier generation (in the L valley) [\cite=tanaka11] [\cite=hirori11]. As a simple estimate, the motion of electrons under an external field is given as

[formula]

where 〈v(t)〉 is the average electron velocity, E(t) is the THz field, me is the effective electron mass, and τ is the relaxation time [\cite=kuehn]. For n-type GaAs, IMI is favorable for electrons in the L valley when the kinetic energy of an electron reaches a threshold energy, Eth = 2.1 eV [\cite=anderson72]. Model calculations show that with an initial carrier density of 1  ×  1016 / cm3, an incident field of 400 kV/cm (1.6 MV/cm in gap field) can increase the carrier density up to ~   1017 / cm3. This process leads to an in-gap conductivity of ~   6 (Ωcm)- 1. The calculated conductivity arising from IMI leads to reasonable agreement between experiment and simulation (Fig. [\ref=Figure2](b) and (d)). For agreement between experiment and simulation at the highest fields, an average in-gap electron mobility of 240 cm2 / Vs was used, consistent with increased carrier-carrier scattering at higher densities and in agreement with the lower end of the L valley mobility previously reported in optical carrier generation studies [\cite=nuss87] [\cite=darrow92].

In contrast to doped GaAs, semi-insulating GaAs (SI-GaAs, carrier density about 1  ×  107 / cm3) with its low conductivity of 1  ×  10- 8 (Ωcm)- 1 yields a distinct SRR resonance and THz field enhancement even at low incident field levels. The inset of Fig. [\ref=Figure3] shows the SRR unit cell used to fabricate arrays on SI-GaAs. The size and period of the SRR resonators are the same as the resonators on the doped GaAs, thereby maintaining the resonance roughly at the same frequency. A smaller SRR gap (1.3 μm) was used to increase the field enhancement given the difficulty in initiating IMI on SI-GaAs due to the small initial carrier density. At our free-space THz field strengths, IMI is ineffective as a carrier generation mechanism in SI-GaAs. However, with the additional field enhancement available from SRRs, we observed a nonlinear response on SI-GaAs that we attribute mainly to IMI.

Figure [\ref=Figure3](a) shows the experimentally measured transmission of metamaterials as a function of frequency for various values of Ein. At the lowest field (100 kV/cm), the response is still in the linear regime with a characteristic dip in the transmission at the LC resonance frequency. As the incident field increases, the metamaterial transmission increases and broadens with negligible change at lower frequencies. We note that even at the highest incident fields (Ein = 400 kV/cm), no nonlinear transmission changes were detected on bare SI-GaAs. Similar to the nonlinear high field results (>   160 kV/cm) on n-type GaAs, the results of Fig. 3(a) suggest a large increase in the in-gap conductivity, indicating a carrier density increase via IMI. EM simulations were performed by changing the conductivity of the GaAs in the horizontal gaps as shown in the inset of Fig. 3(b). The plot shows the transmission change upon increasing the in-gap conductivity from 10- 8 (Ωcm)- 1 to 20 (Ωcm)- 1. The simulations show a trend that is markedly similar to the experimental results.

The inset of Fig. [\ref=Figure3](b) shows the field within the gaps is enhanced by over 20 times on resonance corresponding to a peak time-domain field enhancement factor of 7. Impact ionization calculations show that with an initial carrier density of 1  ×  107 / cm3, an in-gap field of 2.8 MV/cm (corresponding to our largest incident field, Ein = 400 kV/cm) can increase the carrier density by more than ten orders of magnitude up to ~   1018 / cm3. Although we attribute the carrier multiplication primarily to IMI, Zener tunneling cannot, a priori, be discounted. Tunneling calculations [\cite=rodin02] show that with an in-gap peak field of 2.8 MV/cm, Zener tunneling can generate a free carrier density of ~   1017 / cm3 which is one order of magnitude smaller than that reached by IMI. This indicates that carrier generation may involve both processes.

One consequence of embedding metallic resonators into nonlinear dielectrics is the enhancement of the effective nonlinearity by 2 to 4 orders of magnitude (in comparison to the bare nonlinear material) because of the in-gap field enhancement [\cite=rose11b]. For our metamaterials, the nonlinearity results in a change of the oscillator strength of the LC resonance. Because of dispersion, this leads to changes in the effective permittivity and refractive index at frequencies away from resonance. The effective real permittivity (εre) is shown as a function of frequency for various incident electric fields for SRRs on n-type GaAs (Fig. [\ref=Figure4](a)) and SI-GaAs (Fig. [\ref=Figure4](c)). These plots were obtained by performing parameter extraction (for a cubic unit cell) using the full-wave simulations [\cite=smith02] [\cite=smith05] [\cite=tao08] of Fig. [\ref=Figure2](c), (d) and [\ref=Figure3](b) and subsequently mapping the in-gap conductivity to the corresponding incident peak electric field required to achieve that conductivity. It is clear that the field-dependence of εre is different for the two cases. For the SRRs on n-type GaAs, the off-resonance εre at 0.82 THz changes from positive to negative owing to IVS in the doped thin film. Above 160 kV/cm, εre increases from negative to positive values due to the onset of IMI (Fig. 4(b)). For SRRs on SI-GaAs, IMI increases εre monotonically from negative to positive values at 0.85 THz (Fig. 4(d)).

We have demonstrated that metamaterials enable strongly enhanced nonlinearities at terahertz frequencies. The present study illustrates strong THz-induced changes in the carrier mobility and density, yielding conductivity changes up to ten orders of magnitude and large changes in THz transmission. As our proof-of-principle results demonstrate, it will be possible to create a host of nonlinear THz metamaterials which includes, as but one example, nonlinear absorbers for saturable absorber or optical limiting applications.
