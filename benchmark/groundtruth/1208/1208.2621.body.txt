Lemma Corollary

The number of medium amplitude limit cycles of some generalized Liénard systems

Introduction and statement of the results

The bifurcation of limit cycles by perturbing a planar system which has a continuous family of cycles, i.e. periodic orbits, has been an intensively studied phenomenon; see for instance [\cite=CL] and references therein. The simplest planar system having a continuous family of cycles is the linear center, and a special family of its perturbations is given by the generalized polynomial Liénard systems:

[formula]

where [formula], [formula], g0(x) =  - x, gi(x) and Fi(x) are polynomials for i  ≥  1, and ε is a small parameter.

The classical and generalized Liénard systems appear very often in several branches of science and engineering, as biology, chemistry, mechanics, electronics, etc. see for instance [\cite=M] and references therein. In particular Liénard systems are frequent specially in physiological processes, see for instance [\cite=GFD]. In addition, the family of generalized polynomial Liénard systems is one of the most considered families in the study of limit cycles, see [\cite=L].

We assume that [formula], [formula], m =  max 1  ≤  i  ≤  μ{ deg Fi(x)}, and n =  max 1  ≤  i  ≤  ν{ deg gi(x)}. For a small enough ε, let Hμν(m,n) be the maximum number of limit cycles of [\eqref=eq1] that bifurcate from cycles of the linear center (10), i.e. the maximum number of medium amplitude limit cycles which can bifurcate from (10) under the perturbation [\eqref=eq1]. If ν = 0, then Hμ0(m,n) does not depend on n; hence we only write Hμ0(m). The main problem concerning Hμν(m,n) is finding its exact value.

We know from [\cite=LMP] that [formula], where

[formula]

Poincaré-Pontryagin-Melnikov functions

The linear center (10) is the Hamiltonian system associated to the polynomial H = (x2 + y2) / 2; hence its cycles are the circles γc  =  {H - c = 0} with c > 0. By using c as a parameter, the first return map of [\eqref=eq1] can be expressed in terms of ε and c: P(ε,c). Therefore the corresponding displacement function L(ε,c) = P(ε,c)  -  c is analytic for small enough ε and can be written as the power series in ε

[formula]

where Li(c) with i  ≥  1 is the Poincaré-Pontryagin-Melnikov function of order i, which is defined for c  ≥  0.

Let Lk(c) with k  ≥  1 be the first non-vanishing coefficient in [\eqref=df]. The zeros of Lk(c) are important in the study of medium amplitude limit cycles of [\eqref=eq1] because of the Poincaré-Pontryagin-Andronov criterion: The maximum number of isolated zeros, counting multiplicities, of Lk(c) is an upper bound for Hμν(m,n). Furthermore each simple zero c0 of Lk(c) corresponds to one and only one limit cycle of [\eqref=eq1] with ε small enough bifurcating from the cycle γc0.

We know from [\cite=Ili] that Lk(c) has at most [formula] positive zeros, counting multiplicities. However, this result does not give the value of Hμν(m,n) because the upper bound for k depending on μ, ν, m, and n is unknown.

Now, we will recall the algorithm to compute the functions Li(c). System [\eqref=eq1] can be written as

[formula]

where [formula], or equivalently as

[formula]

As we know, L1(c) is given by the classical Poincaré-Pontryagin formula [formula] The result for computing the higher order Poincaré-Pontryagin-Melnikov functions is the following:

(Yakovenko-Franoise-Iliev algorithm [\cite=Ya], [\cite=Fr], [\cite=Ili]). If k  ≥  2 and [formula], then there are polynomials [formula] and [formula] such that [formula], and

[formula]

where

[formula]

The proof of this result easily follows from the Poincaré-Pontryagin formula, and the Ilyashenko-Gavrilov theorem ([\cite=Ily], [\cite=Ga]): If [formula] for all c  ≥  0, then ω  =  dQ  +  qdH, where Q and q are polynomials, and by applying an induction argument. For a detailed proof, see for instance [\cite=Ili], [\cite=IY].

To simplify the computation of the Poincaré-Pontryagin-Melnikov functions, we will give some properties of ωi.

Preliminary results

For computing Lk(c) for [\eqref=eq1] we will use the following two elementary lemmas whose proof is omitted.

Let P be a polynomial in the ring [formula]. We define deg 2P to be the degree of P in [formula].

For i,j  ≥  0 there are homogeneous polynomials [formula] with deg 2Qij = i + j and deg 2qij = i + j - 1, such that [formula] or [formula]. If i = 0, then [formula].

For i,j  ≥  0 there are homogeneous polynomials [formula] with deg 2Qij = i + j + 1 and deg 2qij = i + j, such that [formula].

For i,j  ≥  0 we have [formula]

If [formula] and [formula], then qω∈A.

The next two results are straightforward consequences of these two previous lemmas.

If ω∈A, then [formula], ω = dQ + qdH with q∈S, and qω∈A.

If [formula], then [formula]

The following two lemmas will be important in the proof of Theorem [\ref=mth1].

Suppose Theorem [\ref=th3]. If Ωl∈A for 1  ≤  l  ≤  k - 1, then ωl∈A for 1  ≤  l  ≤  k - 1, and [formula]

We proceed by induction on k. If k = 2, then Ω1  =  ω1∈A. Hence ω1 = dQ1 + q1dH, q1ω1∈A, and [formula] by Corollary [\ref=cor1]. Since [formula] because of Theorem [\ref=th3], [formula].

We assume that the lemma is true for k - 1, and we will prove it for k. By assumption, Ωl∈A for 1  ≤  l  ≤  k - 1. Then, by Corollary [\ref=cor1], Ωl = dQl + qldH with ql∈S for all 1  ≤  l  ≤  k - 1. In addition, by the induction hypothesis, ωl∈A for 1  ≤  l  ≤  k - 2. Thus, [formula] with i,  j  ≥  1 is an element of A following Lemma [\ref=lem2]. Since [formula], ωk - 1∈A. Hence it is clear that [formula] with i,  j  ≥  1 is an element of A, which implies that [formula] by Corollary [\ref=cor1]. Finally, from Theorem [\ref=th3] we have [formula]. Therefore [formula].

Before announce next lemma, we note that each polynomial [formula] of degree m - 1 can be written as

[formula]

Let [formula], where [formula] and [formula].

[formula]

If [formula], then ω = dQ + (y)dH with [formula] of degree [formula], and

[formula]

[formula] if and only if [formula], or [formula].

(a). By (a) and (b) of Lemma [\ref=lem1], [formula]. Finally, the statement follows from Corollary [\ref=cor2].

(b). If [formula], then [formula] by statement (a). This property implies that [formula] by [\eqref=eq7]. From Lemma [\ref=lem1](b) we obtain [formula], thus

[formula]

where [formula] are homogeneous and [formula]. Moreover, a simple computation shows that

[formula]

As [formula] and [formula], it follows that [formula] because of statements (a) and (b) of Lemma [\ref=lem1]. Hence we obtain

[formula]

By using expression [\eqref=eq5] of [formula], a straightforward computation, and Lemma [\ref=lem1](c) we obtain the formula given in the statement. Finally, statement (c) follows from the formula given in statement (b).

System [\eqref=eq1] with μ  =  ν = 1, F1(x) =  - x2, and g1(x) = 1 - x2 does not satisfy the hypothesis in definition of μν(m,n) because g1(x) is not an odd function. Here m = n = 2 and from Theorem [\ref=mth1](a) it follows that 11(2,2) = 0; however, for ε small enough, this system has one medium amplitude limit cycle. Indeed, we need only to prove that the first non-vanishing coefficient of the displacement function [\eqref=df], associated to the system, has a simple positive zero. The system can be written in the form [\eqref=Ll] as dH - εω = 0 with ω = (1 - x2 - 2xy)dx. By Lemma [\ref=lem4](a), [formula], and by Theorem [\ref=PPMF] and Lemma [\ref=lem4](b), L2(c) =  - πc(4 - 2c). Now, system [\eqref=eq1] with μ  =  ν = 2, F1(x) =  - 3x2, F2(x) =  - 2x3, g1(x) = x2 + x3, and [formula] does not satisfy the hypothesis in definition of μν(m,n) because F2(x) is not an even function. In this case m = n = 3 and by Theorem [\ref=mth1](b), 22(3,3) = 1; however, for ε small enough, the resulting system has two medium amplitude limit cycles. Indeed, following previous ideas, and using Theorem [\ref=PPMF] and Lemma [\ref=lem4] it is easy to see that [formula], [formula], and L3(c) =  - πc(c - 1)(c - 2).

Proof of the main results

We can assume, after a linear change of variables if necessary, that Fi(0) = 0 for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  μ. Suppose that [formula] and [formula]. Thus, [formula] and gi(x) can be written as [formula] and [formula], respectively, according to [\eqref=eq7].

(a). By hypothesis, gi(x) is odd for 1  ≤  i  ≤  ν, which means that [formula] for 1  ≤  i  ≤  ν. Let Lk(c) be the first non-vanishing Poincaré-Pontryagin-Melnikov function in [\eqref=df]. If k = 1, then the theorem is true. Indeed, we have [formula], and as [formula], and [formula] by Corollary [\ref=cor1], we obtain [formula]. From [\eqref=eq7] we have [formula]; hence L1(c) has at most [formula] positive zeros because of Corollary [\ref=cor2]. Moreover, we can choose suitable coefficients of F1(x) in such a way that L1(c) has exactly [formula] simple positive zeros. Therefore, by applying the Poincaré-Pontryagin-Andronov criterion it follows that [formula].

Suppose then that k  ≥  2 and we are therefore in the hypothesis of Theorem [\ref=th3]. If Ωl∈A for 1  ≤  l  ≤  k - 1, then [formula] by Lemma [\ref=lem3], and by applying the same idea as in previous paragraph, we obtain [formula]. Accordingly, it remains to prove that Ωl∈A for 1  ≤  l  ≤  k - 1.

We proceed by induction on k. If k = 2, then [formula], which implies that [formula]. We now assume that the assertion is true for k - 2, and we will prove it for k - 1. By induction hypothesis, Ωi∈A for 1  ≤  i  ≤  k - 2, which implies that Ωi = dQi + qidH with qi∈S for 1  ≤  i  ≤  k - 2 by Corollary [\ref=cor1]. Furthermore, by Lemma [\ref=lem3], ωj∈A for 1  ≤  j  ≤  k - 2. Hence [formula] with 1  ≤  i,  j  ≤  k - 2 is an element of A because of Lemma [\ref=lem2]. Since [formula], [formula], whence [formula]. Therefore Ωk - 1∈A, which completes the proof of statement (a).

(b). First, we will note two properties concerning ωi and [formula] which we will use along the proof. Second, we will split the proof into two cases: m odd and m even.

For 1  ≤  i  <  μ0 the 1-form ωi = gi(x)dx is exact, that is, ωi = dQi + qidH with [formula]. Hence, by Theorem [\ref=th3], Ωi  =  ωi and [formula] for 1  ≤  i  <  μ0, and [formula]. On the other hand, since Fi(x) is even for μ0  <  i  ≤  μ, [formula] for μ0  <  i  ≤  μ. Thus, [formula] for i > μ0, and as [formula] because of Lemma [\ref=lem1](b), we conclude that [formula]; of course [formula] for i > μ. Therefore [formula] for all i  >  μ0.

Case m odd. If m is odd, then deg Fμ0(x) = m because Fi(x) is an even polynomial for μ0  <  i  ≤  μ. Since [formula] has an even degree, [formula]. Hence, from Lemma [\ref=lem4](a) it follows that [formula], and it has at most [formula] positive zeros, counting multiplicities; moreover, we can choose suitable coefficients of Fμ0(x) in such a way that Lμ0(c) has exactly [formula] simple positive zeros. Therefore by the Poincaré-Pontryagin-Andronov criterion, [formula].

Case m even. Let Lk(c) be the first non-vanishing Poincaré-Pontryagin-Melnikov function of [\eqref=df]. If k = μ0, then Lμ0(c) has at most [formula] positive zeros, counting multiplicities, because of Lemma [\ref=lem4](a). Since m is even, [formula]. Hence Lμ0(c) has at most [formula] positive zeros, counting multiplicities.

We claim that if k  ≥  μ0 + 1, then [formula], Ωi = dQi + qidH with qi∈S for μ0  ≤  i  ≤  k - 1, and [formula]. By assuming that this assertion is true and by applying Lemma [\ref=lem4](b) we conclude that Lk(c) has at most [formula] positive zeros, counting multiplicities; moreover, we can choose suitable coefficients of μ0 and [formula] in such a way that Lk(c) has exactly [formula] simple positive zeros. Thus, by the Poincaré-Pontryagin-Andronov criterion, [formula]. Therefore, to finish the proof of statement (b) we need only to confirm the assertion, which we prove next by proceeding by induction on k.

If k = μ0 + 1, then we will prove that Ωμ0 = dQμ0 + qμ0dH with qμ0∈S, and that [formula]. We know that Ωμ0  =  ωμ0, and from Lemma [\ref=lem4](b) it follows that Ωμ0  =  ωμ0 = dQμ0 + qμ0dH, where [formula]. On the other hand, by Theorem [\ref=th3], [formula], where [formula]. Since [formula] for 1  ≤  i  <  μ0, Ωμ0 + 1  =  ωμ0 + 1 + qμ0ω1. Moreover, since [formula], [formula].

If k = μ0 + 2, then [formula]. Since [formula], [formula] by Lemma [\ref=lem4](c). This implies that Ω1  =  ω1∈A, and by Corollary [\ref=cor1], Ω1 = dQ1 + q1dH with q1∈S. Moreover, we know that ωμ0 = dQμ0 + qμ0dH with qμ0 = yμ0∈S, and [formula]. Thus, Ωμ0 + 1  =  ωμ0 + 1 + qμ0ω1 = dQμ0 + 1 + qμ0 + 1dH with qμ0 + 1∈S because of Corollary [\ref=cor1]. On the other hand, from Theorem [\ref=th3] we have

[formula]

As ω1∈A and qμ0 + 1∈S, then we have qμ0 + 1ω1∈A following Lemma [\ref=lem2] and [formula] by Corollary [\ref=cor1]. In addition, we know that [formula] for 1  ≤  i  <  μ0 and [formula]. Hence [formula].

We now assume that the assertion holds for k - 1, and we will prove it for k. By Theorem [\ref=th3], [formula], where

[formula]

Since [formula] for 1  ≤  i  <  μ0, [formula].

On the other hand, from the induction hypothesis it follows that [formula], Ωi = dQi + qidH with qi∈S for μ0  ≤  i  ≤  k - 2, and [formula]. Since [formula], [formula] because of Lemma [\ref=lem4](c), which implies that ωk - 1 - μ0∈A. Therefore, [formula] by Lemma [\ref=lem2]. Moreover, we have [formula], and by applying Corollary [\ref=cor1] we obtain

[formula]

Hence [formula] by Lemma [\ref=lem2]. In addition, [formula]. Thus, we obtain [formula]
