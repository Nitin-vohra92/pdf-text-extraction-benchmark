A local spectral condition for strong compactness with some applications to bilateral weighted shifts

Introduction

Let B(X) denote the algebra of bounded linear operators on a complex Banach space X. A subalgebra R  ⊆  B(X) is said to be strongly compact if its unit ball [formula] is precompact in the strong operator topology, and an operator T∈B(X) is said to be strongly compact if the algebra with identity generated by T is strongly compact.

Our interest in this notion stems from the work of Lomonosov [\cite=lomonosov] on the existence of invariant subspaces for essentially normal operators on Hilbert space. He showed that if T is an essentially normal operator on a Hilbert space such that both its commutant [formula] and the commutant [formula] of its adjoint fail to be strongly compact algebras then T has a nontrivial invariant subspace, and moreover, if both T and [formula] fail to be strongly compact operators then T has a nontrivial hyperinvariant subspace.

Lomonosov, Radjavi and Troitsky [\cite=LRT] showed more recently that if T is an operator such that its commutant [formula] is a localizing algebra and the commutant [formula] of its adjoint is a strongly compact algebra, then the adjoint [formula] has an invariant subspace.

A characterization of strongly compact, normal operators was given by Lomonosov, Rodríguez-Piazza, and the first author [\cite=LLR] by a suitable application of the spectral theorem. Necessary and sufficient conditions were also provided for a unilateral weighted shift to be strongly compact in terms of the sliding products of its weights. Some applications were derived, for instance, the restriction of a strongly compact operator to an invariant subspace need not be a strongly compact operator.

Prunaru [\cite=prunaru] used a particular case of a more general result obtained by Lomonosov [\cite=lomonosov] to show that for a pure hyponormal, essentially normal operator T on a Hilbert space, the commutant [formula] of its adjoint is a strongly compact algebra.

Rodríguez-Piazza and the first author [\cite=LRP] showed that the position operator on the space of square integrable functions with respect to a finite measure of compact support is strongly compact if and only if the restriction of the measure to the exterior boundary of its support is purely atomic. (A similar result was obtained earlier on by Froelich and Marsalli [\cite=FM] within the framework of function algebras.) Further applications were derived, for instance, the weakly closed algebra generated by a strongly compact normal operator need not be a strongly compact algebra.

A classification of operator algebras was provided by Marsalli [\cite=marsalli]. He gave some sufficient conditions for an algebra of operators to be strongly compact. He showed that if an operator has a set of eigenvectors that generate a dense linear manifold, then the operator is strongly compact, and moreover, if all the corresponding eigenvalues have finite multiplicity, then the commutant of the operator is strongly compact. Quite recently, Fernández-Valles and the first author [\cite=FVL] applied this condition to test strong compactness for several classes of operators, namely, Cesàro operators, bilateral weighted shifts, and composition operators.

A condition of a different nature seems to be needed to prove strong compactness in absence of eigenvalues. The purpose of this paper is to provide a local spectral condition that is sufficient for an operator on a Banach space to be strongly compact. The condition requires from the operator that the origin must lie in the interior of its full spectrum and that there must be a spanning set of vectors where the local spectral radius is smaller than the distance from the origin to the boundary of the full spectrum. This condition can be applied to operators with no eigenvalues and it fits like a glove to bilateral weighted shifts.

As an application, we describe a large class of strongly compact, bilateral weighted shifts on Hilbert spaces, completing the work of Fernández-Valles and the first author [\cite=FVL]. Then, we restrict our attention to invertible bilateral weighted shifts and we derive a condition for such operators to have a strongly compact inverse. Next, we show that if an invertible bilateral weighted shift and its inverse are strongly compact operators then the algebra generated by both of them is strongly compact. Finally, we give an example of a strongly compact, invertible bilateral weighted shift whose inverse fails to be strongly compact.

A local spectral condition for strong compactness

Let T denote an operator on a complex Banach space X and let σ(T) denote its spectrum. The spectral radius of T is defined as r(T) =  max {|λ|:λ∈σ(T)}. The spectral radius formula provides the alternative expression

[formula]

The local spectral radius of T at a vector x∈X is defined as

[formula]

It is clear that r(x,T)  ≤  r(T) for every x∈X. Dane [\cite=danes] showed that the set of vectors x∈X that satisfy the strict inequality r(x,T)  <  r(T) is of the first category. See also the paper of Müller [\cite=Muller] for more information on this remarkable fact and other related results.

Let G denote the unbounded connected component of [formula]. The full spectrum of T is the set [formula]. It is plain that σ(T)  ⊆  η(σ(T)) and that [formula] is connected. Also, it follows from the maximum modulus principle that if p is any polynomial then

[formula]

Recall that S  ⊆  X is a spanning set if S generates a dense linear subspace of X. It turns out that a subalgebra R  ⊆  B(X) is strongly compact if and only if there is a spanning set S  ⊆  X such that [formula] is precompact for every x∈S. The main result on this paper relies on this simple fact. See the paper of Lomonosov, Rodríguez-Piazza and the first author [\cite=LLR] for a proof of it, and see also the paper of Marsalli [\cite=marsalli] for the same result under a slightly different formulation.

Let T be an operator on a complex Banach space X with 0∈int  η(σ(T)) and suppose that there is a spanning set S  ⊆  X such that r(x,T)  <  d(0,∂η(σ(T))) for every x∈S. Then the operator T is strongly compact.

First, consider the positive distance d  =  d(0,∂η(σ(T))) =  min {|λ|:λ∈∂η(σ(T))}. Since 0∈int  η(σ(T)), we have [formula]. It follows from the above remarks and the spectral mapping theorem that for any polynomial p we have

[formula]

This inequality allows us to control the size of the coefficients for a complex polynomial [formula]. Indeed, using Cauchy's integral formula for the derivatives of order [formula] gives

[formula]

and from here we get the estimate

[formula]

Take a vector x∈S. We need to show that the set [formula] is precompact. Choose some c > 0 with r(x,T) < c < d. Since [formula] as n  →    ∞  , there is an n0 such that [formula] whenever n  ≥  n0. Let ε > 0 and choose an n1  ≥  n0 such that

[formula]

Finally, consider the finite dimensional subspace [formula]. We claim that p(T)x∈F  +  εBX. This is obvious if m  ≤  n1. Otherwise, p(T)x can be expressed as the sum of two terms,

[formula]

The first term belongs to F, while the second term satisfies the estimate

[formula]

which completes the proof of our claim.

It is easy to see that strong compactness is preserved under similarities, that is, if T is a strongly compact operator, C is invertible, and T = C- 1RC then R is strongly compact. Notice that the assumption in Theorem [\ref=main] is also preserved under similarities. More precisely, if T satisfies the condition in Theorem [\ref=main], C is invertible, and T = C- 1RC, then σ(T) = σ(R), {Cx:x∈S} is a spanning set, and r(Cx,R)  ≤  r(x,T)  <  d(0,∂η(σ(T))) = d(0,∂η(σ(R))) for every x∈S, so that R also satisfies the condition in Theorem [\ref=main].

We now recall a couple of definitions from general operator theory. If T is any operator on a Banach space X then the lower bound of T is defined as

[formula]

We also consider the quantity

[formula]

It turns out that if T is invertible then [formula] and r(T- 1) = r1(T)- 1.

Applications to bilateral weighted shifts

Let W be an injective bilateral weighted shift on an infinite dimensional, separable complex Hilbert space H, that is,

[formula]

where (en) is an orthonormal basis of H, the weight sequence (wn) is bounded, n runs through the integers, and wn  ≠  0 for every n. We refer to the survey by Allen Shields [\cite=shields] for information on the spectral parts of weighted shifts. See also the paper of Bourhim [\cite=bourhim] for local spectral properties of weighted shifts. Now consider the quantities

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Then the following relationships are fulfilled

[formula]

[formula]

It was shown by Fernández-Valles and the first author [\cite=FVL] that if a bilateral weighted shift W satisfies the inequality r+3(W) < r-2(W) then its commutant {W}' is strongly compact, and it remained an open question whether or not W is strongly compact when r-2(W)  ≤  r+3(W). The following result provides an affirmative answer to this question for quite a large class of bilateral weighted shifts.

If a bilateral weighted shift W on an infinite dimensional, separable complex Hilbert space satisfies the inequality r+3(W) < r(W) then W is a strongly compact operator.

The full spectrum of W is the closed disk of radius r(W) centered at the origin and the orthornormal basis (ek) is a spanning subset of H. Thus, it suffices to show that r(ek,W) = r+3(W) for each k. This is trivial when k = 0 because [formula] for every n  ≥  1, so that

[formula]

Then, suppose that k  ≠  0 and notice that [formula] for every n  ≥  1. Now, there are two possibilities. On the one hand, if k > 0 then

[formula]

so that

[formula]

On the other hand, if k < 0 and n >  - k then

[formula]

so that

[formula]

as we wanted.

Let W be an invertible bilateral weighted shift on an infinite dimensional, separable complex Hilbert space. If W satisfies the inequality r1(W)  <  r-2(W) then its inverse W- 1 is a strongly compact operator.

If W is an invertible bilateral weighted shift with sequence of weights (wn) then

[formula]

Consider the unitary operator U defined by Uen = e- n, so that [formula]. Now define [formula] and notice that V is another bilateral weighted shift, namely, Ven = vnen + 1, where the sequence of weights (vn) is given by

[formula]

According with the remarks at the end of the proof of Theorem [\ref=main], strong compactness is preserved under similarities. Hence, it suffices to show that V is strongly compact. Then, a quick computation yields r+3(V) = r-2(W)- 1  <  r1(W)- 1 = r(V).

Let W be an invertible bilateral weighted shift on an infinite dimensional, separable complex Hilbert space. If both W and W- 1 are strongly compact then the algebra generated by W and W- 1 is strongly compact.

It suffices to show that the set

[formula]

is precompact for every integer k. Since W and W- 1 are both strongly compact, the sets

[formula]

are both precompact. Notice that for every pair of polynomials p,q with q(0) = 0 we have [formula] and [formula]. Now it follows that Ck  ⊆  C+k  +  C-k so that Ck is precompact, as we wanted.

Let W be an invertible bilateral weighted shift on an infinite dimensional, separable complex Hilbert space. If both inequalities r+3(W) < r(W) and r1(W)  <  r-2(W) are fulfilled then the algebra generated by W and W- 1 is strongly compact.

Since r+3(W) < r(W), it follows from Theorem [\ref=shift] that W is strongly compact, and since r1(W)  <  r-2(W), it follows from Corollary [\ref=inverse1] that W- 1 is also strongly compact. Hence, the desired result is a consequence of Theorem [\ref=rational].

Example. Consider a bilateral weighted shift W whose sequence of weights (wn) satisfies the conditions 1  ≤  |wn|  ≤  2 for each n  ≥  0 and wn = 1 for each n < 0. It is plain that such a weighted shift is bounded and invertible, and that [formula]. We claim that W- 1 fails to be strongly compact, for otherwise the sequence e- n  =  W- ne0 would have a norm convergent subsequence as n  →    ∞  , a contradiction. Then, the sequence of weights can be chosen in such a way that

[formula]

There are many possible choices for such a sequence of weights, for instance, if we set wk = 2 whenever 2n  ≤  k  ≤  2n + n and wk = 1 otherwise. Therefore, r+3(W) = 1 and r(W) = r+(W) = 2. It follows from Theorem [\ref=shift] that W is a strongly compact operator. Summarizing, we constructed a strongly compact bilateral weighted shift whose inverse fails to be strongly compact.
