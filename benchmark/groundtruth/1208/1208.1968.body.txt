Introduction

Let [formula] be forms of degree d, and let V* be the union of the loci of singularities of the varieties

[formula]

in the following all dimensions are meant to be affine. Then Birch ([\cite=B]) has shown that if

[formula]

then the expected Hardy-Littlewood asymptotic formula

[formula]

for the number of integer solutions [formula] of the system

[formula]

holds true, where the [formula] are constrained to an expanding box of size P, and [formula] and [formula] are the singular integral and the singular series, respectively. Alternatively, V* can also be described as the variety of all points [formula] for which the rank of the Jacobi matrix

[formula]

is less than r (see also [\cite=AM]). For r = 1, dim V* is just the dimension of the singular locus of the variety

[formula]

but for r > 1 the quantity dim V* can exceed the dimension of the singular locus of V: For example, suppose that V is non-singular. Then it is still possible to find [formula], not all zero, for which the discriminant [formula] is zero. This implies that there is an [formula] for which

[formula]

whence [formula] and dim V*  ≥  1. As another example, consider a system of r diagonal forms [formula] of degree d with non-singular coefficient matrix. Then V is non-singular, but by applying row operations we can find a form in the pencil of [formula] with r - 1 coefficients being zero, which shows that dim V*  ≥  r - 1. Our first aim in this paper is to show that Birch's condition [\eqref=virginia_water] can be relaxed to the effect that dim V* can be replaced by

[formula]

where

[formula]

In particular, for [formula] we have [formula], so

[formula]

and for r = 1 the two quantities are the same. However, for r > 1 strict inequality

[formula]

is possible, as the left hand side only involves the rational pencil of [formula], whereas the right hand side implicitly also includes the complex one. For instance, suppose that [formula] have the property that the equation

[formula]

has no solution [formula]; one example for r = d = 2,s = 13 which can be easily checked by a computer algebra package would be given by the pair of quadratic forms

[formula]

Then [\eqref=ente] having no solution [formula] implies that

[formula]

whereas as shown above dim V*  ≥  1 for r > 1, even if the variety V is non-singular. Summarising these observations, we therefore find that the following result is always of the same quality as Birch's one given by [\eqref=virginia_water] regarding the number of required variables, and for r > 1 can even be stronger as illustrated by the example above.

Let [formula] be forms of degree d  ≥  2, and suppose that

[formula]

Then if B is a box in [formula] with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, and contained in the unit box, then there exists a positive δ such that for the quantity

[formula]

the asymptotic formula

[formula]

holds true, where [formula] and [formula] are the singular integral and the singular series, respectively.

For instance, as shown by the example above, Theorem [\ref=stammtisch] handles 'generic' pairs of quadratic forms in 13 variables; see also [\cite=Munshi] for recent work by Munshi which gives a stronger result in this special case r = d = 2. Usually, V* as well as the [formula] are difficult to understand, and one would prefer a condition which is arithmetically easier to handle. This point of view was taken up by Schmidt ([\cite=S1], [\cite=S2]) for the case of quadratic and cubic forms, and in [\cite=Schmidt] for forms of any degree. For a system of r rational quadratic forms, he could show that an asymptotic formula for the number of integer zeros in an expanding region holds true, provided that every form in the rational pencil has rank exceeding 2r2 + 3r. Birch's condition ([\ref=virginia_water]) for d = 2 reads s >  dim V* + 2r2 + 2r, so one might wonder if Schmidt's rank bound 2r2 + 3r can be relaxed to 2r2 + 2r. This is indeed the case, as illustrated by our first result.

Let [formula] be quadratic forms, such that each form in their rational pencil has rank exceeding 2r2 + 2r. Then if B is a box in [formula] with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, and contained in the unit box, then there exists a positive δ such that for the quantity

[formula]

the asymptotic formula

[formula]

holds true, where [formula] and [formula] are the singular integral and the singular series, respectively.

In particular, under the rank condition of Theorem [\ref=see], a system [formula] of rational quadratic forms satisfies the Local-Global principle. If one imposes further conditions, one can show that [formula] and [formula] are positive and concludes that there are non-trivial rational zeros. The following result is along these lines, improving a 2r2 + 3r which has previously been known (see Theorem 1 in [\cite=D]) to 2r2 + 2r.

Let [formula] be rational quadratic forms. Suppose that each form in the complex pencil of [formula] has rank exceeding 2r2 + 2r, and suppose that the system [formula] has a non-singular real zero. Then the asymptotic formula ([\ref=unknown]) holds true, and the singular integral [formula] and the singular series [formula] are positive. In particular, the intersection [formula] has a non-trivial rational zero.

Since each form in the complex pencil of [formula] has rank exceeding 2r2 + 2r, also each form in the rational pencil of [formula] has rank exceeding 2r2 + 2r. Hence, by Theorem [\ref=see], the asymptotic formula ([\ref=unknown]) holds true. Moreover, for the same reason (see [\cite=D] or [\cite=S1] for details), each form in any [formula]-rational pencil of [formula] has rank exceeding 2r2 + 2r as well. As shown in [\cite=D], p. 510, this implies that [formula]. Finally, the assumption on non-singular real solubility of [formula] implies that [formula].

Since a singular rational quadratic form trivially has a non-trivial rational zero, Corollary [\ref=akw] for r = 1 recovers a classical result by Meyer [\cite=M]: Any indefinite rational quadratic form in at least five variables has a non-trivial rational zero. Much more than Corollary [\ref=akw] is known for r = 2 (see [\cite=C], [\cite=HB]), but for r > 2 our result seems to be the strongest available at present. To state our result for systems of cubic forms, we first have to introduce the following terminology: If [formula] is a rational cubic form, then its h-invariant h(C) is the smallest non-negative integer h such that C can be written in the form

[formula]

for suitable linear forms [formula] and quadratic forms [formula]. One can think of the h-invariant as some way of generalising rank from quadratic to cubic forms. For a system of r rational cubic forms, Schmidt ([\cite=S2], Theorem 2) has shown that an asymptotic formula for the number of integer zeros in an expanding region holds true, provided that each form in the rational pencil of [formula] has h-invariant exceeding 10r2 + 6r. Again, Birch's condition ([\ref=virginia_water]) for d = 3 suggests that a weaker bound, namely 8r2 + 8r could suffice, which indeed is true.

Let [formula] be cubic forms, such that each form in their rational pencil has h-invariant exceeding 8r2 + 8r. Then if B is a box in [formula] with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, and contained in the unit box, then there exists a positive δ such that for the quantity

[formula]

the asymptotic formula

[formula]

holds true, where [formula] and [formula] are the singular integral and the singular series, respectively.

Not surprisingly, the proofs of Theorem [\ref=stammtisch], Theorem [\ref=see] and Theorem [\ref=rumpsteak] make use of the Hardy-Littlewood circle method. Our main innovation is a variant of Birch's form of Weyl's inequality for general systems of forms which turns out to be more useful in the specific situations encountered here, where one knows a certain lower rank (or dimension of singular locus) bound for all forms in the rational pencil of the given ones. One might ask if our method also provides an analogue of Theorem [\ref=see] and Theorem [\ref=rumpsteak] for systems of rational forms of degree d  ≥  4. This is indeed the case, and the treatment is analogous to that for d = 3, so we only give a brief sketch: The concept of an h-invariant generalises from cubic forms to higher degree forms, see Schmidt's seminal work [\cite=Schmidt], p. 245. Using one of the key results in [\cite=Schmidt], one can show that if [formula] are forms of degree d, and each form in their rational pencil has h-invariant exceeding

[formula]

where φ(2) = φ(3) = 1, φ(4) = 3, φ(5) = 13, and φ(d) < ( log 2)- dd! in general, then an asymptotic formula for the number of integer zeros of the system [formula] in an expanding box of size P of the form

[formula]

holds true, parallelising Theorems [\ref=see] and [\ref=rumpsteak] (note that also Theorem II in [\cite=Schmidt] deals with generic systems of forms of not necessarily the same degrees and could be specialised to the setting here, but is not optimised to our situation of all forms having the same degree d). However, for d  ≥  4 the bound [\eqref=oktober] no longer parallels the corresponding term r(r + 1)(d - 1)2d - 1 in Birch's result [\eqref=virginia_water] as φ(d) > 1 for d  ≥  4. Acknowledgment: The author would like to thank the referees for carefully reading this paper. Since this paper was submitted for publication, Schindler [\cite=Schindler] has posted a preprint which independently proves Theorem [\ref=stammtisch] and the result described around equation [\eqref=oktober] above which is proved in section [\ref=thursday].

Weyl's inequality

Let [formula] be forms of degree d  ≥  2. We can write Fi in the form

[formula]

and for the purpose of studying the system [formula] we may without loss of generality assume that the coefficients [formula] are symmetric in [formula]. Let B be an s-dimensional box with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, and for [formula] let [formula] be the exponential sum

[formula]

Moreover, for [formula], [formula] and [formula] let

[formula]

where

[formula]

Finally, let

[formula]

where ||  ·  || as usual denotes distance to the nearest integer. In the following, all implied O-constants depend at most on [formula] and a chosen small positive ε.

Let 0  <  θ  ≤  1, ε > 0 and k > 0. Then if

[formula]

then

[formula]

This is Lemma 2.4 in [\cite=B].

Our next lemma can be thought of as a variant of Lemma 2.5 in [\cite=B], where alternative (iii) has been replaced by one more suitable for dealing with systems of forms satisfying a certain pencil condition.

In the notation of Lemma [\ref=england], we either (i) have

[formula]

or (ii) there are integers [formula] such that

[formula]

or (iii) there are integers [formula], not all zero, such that

[formula]

where

[formula]

Our proof is similar to that of Lemma 2.5 in [\cite=B] (see also the remark at the bottom of page 248 in [\cite=B]). Suppose that alternative (i) is false. Then by Lemma [\ref=england], the lower bound ([\ref=rooney]) holds true. Let Ψ be the matrix whose elements are the numbers [formula], where the column i ranges from 1 to r, and the rows range over the Cartesian product of all possible choices for [formula] times all possible choices for tuples [formula] counted by N in ([\ref=rooney]). Case I: rank Ψ = r. Then Ψ has a non-singular r  ×  r submatrix R. Each row of R is of the form

[formula]

for suitable [formula] and [formula] counted by N in ([\ref=rooney]). In particular, all matrix elements [formula] are integers and

[formula]

for all [formula] and for all [formula]. By ([\ref=rooney]) and the definition ([\ref=gerrard]) of N, we have

[formula]

where the bi are integers and [formula] such that

[formula]

Now let q  =   det R. Then q  ≠  0 and

[formula]

by ([\ref=klose]). Let [formula] be the solution of

[formula]

By Cramer's rule, [formula]. Now ([\ref=podolski]) and ([\ref=mueller]) yield

[formula]

Moreover, by ([\ref=klose]) and Cramer's rule all elements in the matrix qR- 1 are at most O(Pθ(r - 1)(d - 1)). Hence ([\ref=uruguay]) and ([\ref=neuner]) give

[formula]

Clearly, by multiplying with - 1 if necessary we can ensure that [formula], and by dividing through [formula] we can achieve [formula] without affecting the quality of the Diophantine approximations to [formula]. Hence (ii) is true. Case II: rank Ψ < r. In this case, the columns of Ψ must be linearly dependent. Therefore, there exists [formula] such that

[formula]

for all [formula] and for all [formula] that are counted by N in ([\ref=rooney]). By ([\ref=bookie]), ([\ref=rooney]) and ([\ref=odds]) we immediately get the conclusion in alternative (iii).

Birch's Theorem revisited

The following result is along the lines of in [\cite=B] and shows that alternative (iii) in Lemma [\ref=booker] can be excluded if the variety under consideration is sufficiently non-singular.

Keeping the notation of sections [\ref=mallorca] and [\ref=chile], let [formula]. Then

[formula]

where the implied O-constant does not depend on [formula].

Following the proof of Lemma 3.2 in [\cite=B], we have to consider the variety

[formula]

Then

[formula]

where the implied O-constant depends at most on s, r and d. Now let U be the diagonal

[formula]

Then

[formula]

and for each [formula] we have [formula], so [formula] and

[formula]

which finishes the proof.

Our next result is an analogue of the central Lemma 4.3 in [\cite=B].

Keeping the notation of sections [\ref=mallorca] and [\ref=chile], define K by

[formula]

Then we either (i) have

[formula]

or alternative (ii) of Lemma [\ref=booker] holds true.

Suppose that alternative (iii) of Lemma [\ref=booker] is true. Then there exists [formula] such that

[formula]

On the other hand, by Lemma [\ref=neujahr], we know that

[formula]

The conditions ([\ref=beethoven]) and ([\ref=schubert]) are only compatible if [formula], so for k = Kθ  -  ε alternative (iii) of Lemma [\ref=booker] is impossible, which proves the result.

Using Lemma [\ref=liederhalle] instead of Lemma 4.3 in [\cite=B] and then following the rest of the arguments in [\cite=B] establishes Theorem [\ref=stammtisch].

Systems of quadratic forms

For quadratic forms, it is easy to give an interpretation of alternative (iii) in Lemma [\ref=booker]. To this end we need the following elementary observation.

Let [formula] be linear forms, such that their span in the space of linear forms has rank at least m. Then, uniformly in [formula], we have

[formula]

This is trivial.

We can now reformulate Lemma [\ref=booker] for systems of quadratic forms.

Let d = 2. Suppose that each quadratic form in the rational pencil of [formula] has rank at least m. Then, using the notation of Lemma [\ref=england], we either (i) have

[formula]

or alternative (ii) (where d = 2) of Lemma [\ref=booker] holds true.

Suppose that neither alternative (i) nor alternative (ii) of Lemma [\ref=booker] are true. Then alternative (iii) must be true. Hence there exists [formula] such that [formula]. This means that

[formula]

Now consider the quadratic form

[formula]

This form is in the rational pencil of [formula], hence rank F  ≥  m. Clearly

[formula]

Since rank F  ≥  m, the dimension of the linear space of linear forms spanned by the [formula] is at least m. Hence, by Lemma [\ref=longport],

[formula]

The conditions ([\ref=jekyll]) and ([\ref=hyde]) are only compatible if s - 2k / θ  -  ε  ≤  s - m, which implies that [formula]. Therefore, for k = mθ / 2 - ε alternative (iii) is impossible, which proves Lemma [\ref=greenwhich].

In the notation of Lemma [\ref=england], suppose that each quadratic form in the rational pencil of [formula] has rank exceeding 2r2 + 2r. Moreover, let 0 < Δ  ≤  r. Then for each ∈[0,1]r we either (i) have

[formula]

(ii) or there exist integers [formula] such that [formula], 1  ≤  q  ≪  PΔ and

[formula]

This follows immediately from Lemma [\ref=greenwhich] on letting Δ = rθ and m = 2r2 + 2r + 1, noting that [formula].

Note that this is essentially the same as Lemma 6 in [\cite=S1] (our bound ([\ref=longitude]) is slightly stronger than (i) in Lemma 6 in [\cite=S1], under the weaker rank condition 2r2 + 2r instead of 2r2 + 3r). We can now proceed exactly as in [\cite=S1] to deduce Theorem [\ref=see].

Systems of cubic forms

The cubic case is slightly more difficult. We start our discussion with the following result going back to Davenport and Lewis.

Let [formula] be a cubic form, given in the form

[formula]

for symmetric integer coefficients cj1,j2,j3. Moreover, let Bj be the bilinear forms

[formula]

Then

[formula]

where h(C) is the h-invariant of C as introduced in section [\ref=mallorca]. The implied O-constant does not depend on C.

This is Lemma 3 in [\cite=DL].

Let d = 3. Suppose that each cubic form in the rational pencil of [formula] has h-invariant at least m. Then, using the notation of Lemma [\ref=england], we either (i) have

[formula]

or alternative (ii) (where d = 3) of Lemma [\ref=booker] holds true.

Suppose that neither alternative (i) nor alternative (ii) of Lemma [\ref=booker] are true. Then by alternative (iii) of that lemma, there exists [formula] such that [formula]. This means that

[formula]

Now consider the cubic form

[formula]

This form is in the rational pencil of [formula], hence h(C)  ≥  m. Using the notation of Lemma [\ref=mappus], we find that

[formula]

hence

[formula]

Since h(C)  ≥  m, by Lemma [\ref=mappus] we have

[formula]

The conditions ([\ref=liam]) and ([\ref=neeson]) are only compatible if

[formula]

which implies that [formula]. As for Lemma [\ref=greenwhich] above, this concludes the proof.

In the notation of Lemma [\ref=england], suppose that each cubic form in the rational pencil of [formula] has h-invariant exceeding 8r2 + 8r. Moreover, let 0 < Δ  ≤  2r. Then for each ∈[0,1]r we either (i) have

[formula]

or (ii) there exist integers [formula] such that [formula], 1  ≤  q  ≪  PΔ and

[formula]

This follows immediately from Lemma [\ref=schiff] on setting Δ = 2rθ and m = 8r2 + 8r + 1, noting that [formula].

Note that this is essentially the same as Lemma 7 in [\cite=S2] (our bound ([\ref=christopher_grill]) is slightly stronger than the bound (i) in Lemma 7 in [\cite=S2], under the weaker rank condition 8r2 + 8r instead of 10r2 + 6r). We can now continue exactly as in [\cite=S2] to deduce Theorem [\ref=rumpsteak].

Systems of higher degree forms

Let us briefly sketch how to obtain the result stated at the end of the introduction. The argument is almost completely analogous to that in section [\ref=maritime], all the hard work just being imported from [\cite=Schmidt]. We have to replace bilinear forms by (d - 1)-linear forms, and to replace Lemma [\ref=mappus] by Proposition III from [\cite=Schmidt], yielding an upper bound of

[formula]

instead of [\eqref=regen], where F is our form of degree d under consideration, and φ(2) = φ(3) = 1, φ(4) = 3, φ(5) = 13, and φ(d) < ( log 2)- dd! in general (see Proposition [formula] in [\cite=Schmidt]). One can then modify the proof of Lemma [\ref=schiff] accordingly, obtaining

[formula]

instead of [\eqref=dienstag], which yields the analogue of Lemma [\ref=schiff] to the effect that if [formula] are integer forms of degree d, and each form in their rational pencil has h-invariant at least m, then either

[formula]

or alternative (ii) of Lemma [\ref=booker] holds true. Putting Δ = (d - 1)rθ and

[formula]

one finds that

[formula]

giving the corresponding analogue of Corollary [\ref=windsor_farm_shop]: If each form in the rational pencil of [formula] has h-invariant exceeding φ(d)(d - 1)2d - 1r(r + 1), then either

[formula]

or there exist integers [formula] such that [formula], 1  ≤  q  ≪  PΔ and

[formula]

Using the techniques from [\cite=B], one can then establish the announced asymptotic formula for the number of integer zeros of [formula] in an expanding box.
