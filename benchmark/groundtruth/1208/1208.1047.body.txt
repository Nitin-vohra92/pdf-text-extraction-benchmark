In recent years the role of effective chiral Lagrangians has grown as an important indicator of the order and universality class of phase transitions, as well as of the nature and location of the related CEP that may occur for the ground state of QCD in presence of external parameters, such as finite temperature T, baryonic chemical potential μB, magnetic field B [\cite=Pawlowski:2011]. In parallel, lQCD advances at zero and moderate chemical potential with masses approaching the physical values of the light quarks [\cite=Bazavov:2012] and pion mass [\cite=Ratti:2012], strongly indicate at a crossover transition from the hadronic to the quark-gluon phase at finite T and μB = 0. Combining lQCD and chemical freeze-out data from relativistic heavy-ion collision facilities, the location of the CEP is presently conjectured to eventually occur at [formula] and [formula], [\cite=Stephanov:2004],[\cite=Gupta:2011].

We consider the SU(3) flavor and spin-0 Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model (NJL) [\cite=Nambu:1961] with inclusion of the U(1)A breaking 't Hooft flavor determinant [\cite=Hooft:1976]-[\cite=Reinhardt:1988] and eight quark (8q) interactions [\cite=Osipov:2006b],[\cite=Osipov:2007a] (of which there exist two types, one of them violationg the OZI rule, with strength g1), and extend it to include the Polyakov loop (PNJL) [\cite=Fukushima:2004]-[\cite=Moreira:2011]. The 8q have been firstly introduced to stabilize the effective potential of the model [\cite=Osipov:2006b]. Their role turned out to be of significant importance in the behavior of model observables in presence of external parameters [\cite=Osipov:2007b]-[\cite=Hiller:2010],[\cite=Kashiwa:2008a]-[\cite=Gatto]. Of particular interest is that the 8q coupling strengths g1 can be varied in tune with the 4q interaction strength G without changing the vacuum condensates and low energy meson spectra, except for the σ-meson mass mσ which decreases with increasing g1. Fits to the low lying pseudoscalar and scalar meson spectra yield mσ  ~  560 MeV for g1 = 6000 GeV- 8 and mσ  ~  690 MeV for g1 = 1500 GeV- 8 [\cite=Osipov:2007a]. In the μ,T plane (where [formula]) the g1,G interplay gives rise to a line of CEP, starting from the regime of large ratios R  ~  20 (NJL) and R  ~  10 (PNJL) in the case of weak 8q coupling g1, to small ratios for strong g1. In the first case the chiral condensate is related with spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) driven by 4q interactions, in the second scenario SSB is induced by the 6q 't Hooft strength [\cite=Osipov:2007a],[\cite=Osipov:2008],[\cite=Hiller:2010]. This continuous set of CEP is particular to the 8q extension of the model.However a correlation between mσ and the location of the CEP is also observed in the (2+1) - flavor quark-meson Lagrangian, where besides the 't Hooft term, a quartic mesonic contribution is present [\cite=Schaefer:2010],[\cite=Chatterjee], thus bearing a resemblance to the semi-bosonized version of the 8q NJL Lagrangian [\cite=Osipov:2007a]. In order to restrict the g1 values one may: i) calculate decays and scattering in the vacuum, which are expected to narrow the choice and ii) compare with available lQCD data at finite T and moderate μ. In the present study we try to explore the second option. For the PNJL case an extra uncertainty arises due to the parameters related with the choice of Polyakov potential UP. In particular the T0 parameter of [\cite=Ratti:2006],[\cite=Roessner:2007] has a sizeable effect on the transition temperature. First we show in Fig. 1 the CEP lines in a (μ,T) vs. g1 diagram. The PNJL model (solid lines) enhances the effect of pushing R to small values as functios of g1 in comparison with the NJL case (dashed lines). The crossing of the CEP(T) and CEP(μ) lines, ( yielding R = 3), is reached for the PNJL at g1  ~  6.4  ×  103GeV- 8, for the choice T0 = 190 MeV, whereas it occurs for the NJL only at a much larger value, g1  ~  8.4  ×  103GeV- 8 (we remind that with increasing g1 the crossover becomes sharper and eventually gives rise to a first order transition at μ = 0, which happens at g1  ~  9  ×  103GeV- 8 in the NJL case). Changing T0, the CEP(T) is shifted up (down) with increasing (decreasing) T0 (see caption of Fig.1), while CEP(μ) remains sensibly unaltered. In Fig. 2 the chiral condensates and dressed Polyakov loop for u,s quarks are shown for the NJL as function of T for μ = 0 and with varying strength g1 (see caption). For g110- 3 = 1;5;6.5;8 GeV- 8 the transition temperatures Tt defined at the corresponding inflection points of the curves are Tt = 192;163;147;135 MeV for the u-condensate, Tt = 197;163;150;135 MeV for the u-quark dressed Polyakov loop, Tt = 197;160;147;135 MeV at the first inflection point of s-quark condensate, Tt = 270;240;235;225 MeV at its 2nd inlection point, Tt  =    -  ;166;150;135 MeV at 1st inflection point of the dressed s-quark Polyakov loop and Tt = 270;240;235;225 MeV at its 2nd inflection point. The 1st set of inflection points in the case of the s-quark condensate and dressed Polyakov loop occur due to the gap equations that correlate the u and s variables, yielding similar Tt for the u and s observables. The 2nd inflection point occurs at temperatures Tt larger by ~  80 MeV. A similar pattern is observed for the PNJL model in Fig. 3, the second inflection points occur at roughly 55 MeV higher Tt values. Visually these 2nd inflection points can barely be detected, the transition is very slow and smooth. This behavior can be traced back to the fact that for large T the s-quark constituent quark mass approaches asymptotically its current quark mass value, which is much larger than for the u-quark. It is a disputable matter which temperature should be taken to characterize the transition for the s-quark in these observables. A calculation of the chiral and quark number susceptibilities associated with the s-quark in the NJL model display only one peak characterizing the transition temperature. In Fig. 4 one sees however that in the PNJL case two peaks can occur again for the s-quark chiral susceptibility. Fig. 5 (a) shows the trace anomaly calculated for g1 = 6000 GeV- 8, for various values of the parameter T0 in comparison with lattice data. In Fig. 5 (b) the subtracted condensate Δls is shown for several values for g1, calculated with T0 = .19 GeV, and compared to lQCD. In Fig. 6 the light chiral condensate is compared with lQCD data extrapolated to the continuum limit [\cite=Bazavov:2012] for different values of g1 and with UP of [\cite=Ratti:2006] for the cases T0 = .15 GeV (left) and T0 = .19 GeV (right).

From these comparisons we conclude (i) that the smaller the ratio [formula] related with the CEP location, the larger the 8q interaction strength g1 must be chosen; a sizeable dependence on the T0 parameter of the Polyakov potentials can induce shifts of the order of several tens of MeV in Tc (Fig. 1). For R = 3 we get g1 of the order 6000 GeV- 8 and Tc = 158 - 188 MeV for the range T0 = 190 - 270 MeV. (ii) Besides the 8q strength, the Polyakov loop plays also a substantial role in decreasing the ratio R. (iii) The observables calculated at μ = 0 related with the light quarks, chiral condensates, traced Polyakov loop and dressed Polyakov loop (Fig. 3), chiral and quark number susceptibilities (Fig. 4 (a), (d)), as well as the s-quark number susceptibility (Fig. 4 (e)) and Polyakov loop susceptibility (Fig. 4 (c)) yield a crossover temperature Tt  ~  179 MeV for g1 = 6000 GeV- 8 and T0 = .19 GeV. (iv) Some of the s-quark observables show two possible transition temperatures, Fig.2,3,4(b), the first close to the u-quark transition, the second about 50 MeV higher for the PNJL model. (v) The best fit to the trace anomaly is for g1 = 6000 GeV- 8 at T0 = .21GeV (Fig. 5 (a)) and for the observable Δls we obtain a reasonable fit with g1 = 5...6  ×  103 GeV- 8 and T0 = .19 GeV (Fig. 5 (b)). (vi) The peak positions and heights of the continuum extrapolated light quark chiral susceptibility vary considerably (Fig. 6). This big spread allows to accomodate a large range of g1 values, whose peak positions in turn depend also on the choice of the T0 parameter. The value g1  ~  5  ×  103GeV- 8 is eventually the best choice if one takes the height of the peak also into consideration.
