The second coefficient of the asymptotic expansion of the weighted Bergman kernel on [formula]

Introduction and statement of the main result

Let L be a holomorphic line bundle over a Hermitian manifold (M,Θ), where Θ is a smooth positive (1,1)-form on M, and let Lk be the k-th tensor power of L. Let [formula] be the Gaffney extension of the Kodaira Laplacian acting on (0,q) forms with values in Lk. The Bergman kernel is the distribution kernel of the orthogonal projection onto [formula] in the L2 space. We assume that the curvature of L is non-degenerate of constant signature (n-,n+) on M and let q = n-. When M is compact, Catlin [\cite=Cat97] and Zelditch [\cite=Zel98] established the asymptotic expansion of the diagonal of the Bergman kernel for q = n- = 0 and Berman-Sjöstrand [\cite=BS05], Ma-Marinescu [\cite=MM06] established the asymptotic expansion of the Bergman kernel for [formula]. When M is complete and L is uniformly positive on M with [formula] and ∂Θ bounded below, where RK*M is the curvature of the bundle of (n,0) forms, Ma-Marinescu [\cite=MM08a] obtained the asymptotic expansion of the Bergman kernel for q = n- = 0. More generally, if M is any complex manifold and [formula] has O(k- n0) small spectral gap on an open set [formula] (see Definition 1.5 in [\cite=HM11], for the precise meaning of O(k- n0) small spectral gap), then it is known by a recent result (see Theorem 1.6 in [\cite=HM11]) that the Bergman kernel admits a full asymptotic expansion in k on D. The coefficients of these expansions turned out to be deeply related to various problem in complex geometry (see e.g. [\cite=Do:01], [\cite=Fine08], [\cite=Fine10]).

The first four coefficients of the expansion of the Bergman kernel for q = n- = 0 on the diagonal were computed by Lu [\cite=Lu00]. The method of Lu is to construct appropriate peak sections as in [\cite=Tian], using Hörmander's L2-method. Ma-Marinescu [\cite=MM10] calculated the first three coefficients of the expansion of the kernel of Berezin-Toeplitz quantization on the diagonal by using kernel calculations on [formula]. The author [\cite=Hsiao12] gave a new method to calculated the first three coefficients of the expansion of the kernel of Berezin-Toeplitz quantization on the diagonal by using microlocal analysis. All these results are concern q = n- = 0.

In this paper, we give for the first time a formula of the second coefficient of the expansion of the Bergman kernel for q = n- > 0 on [formula]. We calculate the trace of the second coefficient of the expansion of the Bergman kernel for q = n- > 0 when [formula] and L is the trivial line bundle [formula] endowed with the metric [formula], where [formula] is a given real valued function with [formula] is non-degenerate of constant signature (n-,n+) on [formula]. There are two ingredients of our approach: the phase function version of the asymptotic expansion of the Bergman kernel and the method of stationary phase. Even through the calculation is quite complicate, the arguments in this paper are simple.

After the paper was completed Wen Lu [\cite=Lu12] informed the author that he also obtained the formula for the coefficient b1 by using the method of Ma-Marinescu [\cite=MM07]. Moreover, Wen Lu [\cite=Lu12] obtained the formula for b1 on general compact complex manifolds.

Notations

Let Ω be a C∞ paracompact manifold equipped with a smooth density of integration. We let T(Ω) and T*(Ω) denote the tangent bundle of Ω and the cotangent bundle of Ω respectively. The complexified tangent bundle of Ω and the complexified cotangent bundle of Ω will be denoted by [formula] and [formula] respectively. We write <   ,   >   to denote the pointwise duality between T(Ω) and T*(Ω). We extend <   ,   >   bilinearly to [formula]. Let E be a C∞ vector bundle over Ω. The fiber of E at x∈Ω will be denoted by Ex. Let Y  ⊂    ⊂  Ω be an open set. From now on, the spaces of smooth sections of E over Y and distribution sections of E over Y will be denoted by C∞(Y;  E) and [formula] respectively. Let [formula] be the subspace of [formula] whose elements have compact support in Y. Put [formula]. We let L2(Y;  E) denote the L2 space of sections of E over Y.

We shall denote the real coordinates by xj, [formula], and the complex coordinates by [formula], zj = x2j - 1 + ix2j, [formula]. Let [formula] and [formula] denote the holomorphic tangent bundle and the anti-holomorphic tangent bundle of [formula] respectively. We take the Hermitian metric ( | ) on [formula] such that [formula], [formula], [formula], where [formula], [formula], [formula], and δj,k = 1 if j = k, δj,k = 0 if j  ≠  k. For [formula], [formula], let [formula] be the bundle of (p,q) forms of [formula]. We say that a multiindex [formula] has length q and write [formula]. We say that J is strictly increasing if [formula]. For multiindices [formula], [formula], we define [formula]. We take the Hermitian metric ( | ) on [formula] so that [formula] is an orthonormal frame for [formula]. Let [formula]. Then the trace of T is given by

[formula]

where [formula] means that the summation is performed only over strictly increasing multiindices. Thus Tr  T = 0 if

[formula]

for all strictly increasing multiinindices K, J, [formula], [formula].

If [formula], let [formula] be the adjoint of left exterior multiplication [formula]. That is,

[formula]

for all [formula], [formula]. Notice that [formula] depends anti-linearly on w.

Let E, F be C∞ vector bundles over a smooth manifold M. We say that a k-dependent function [formula] is negligible if for every compact set K  ⊂  M  ×  M and for all N > 0 and multiindice α, β, there is a constant cN,α,β,K > 0 independent of k such that for k sufficiently large, [formula], (x,y)∈K. Let [formula] be a k-dependent smooth function. We write

[formula]

in [formula], [formula], [formula], if for all [formula], every compact set K  ⊂  M  ×  M and for all multiindice α, β, there is a constant cM0,α,β,K > 0 independent of k such that for k sufficiently large, (x,y)∈K.

The asymptotic expansion of the Bergman kernel

Let [formula]. In this work we assume that [formula] is non-degenerate of constant signatute (n-,n+). That is, the number of negative eigenvalues of [formula] is n- and n- + n+ = n.

We take [formula] as the volume form on [formula]. Let ( | ) be the inner product on [formula] defined by

[formula]

For k > 0, let ( | )k be the inner product on [formula] defined by

[formula]

Let [formula] and [formula] be the completions of [formula] with respect to ( | ) and ( | )k respectively. We extend the L2 inner products ( | ) and ( | )k to [formula] and [formula] respectively.

Let [formula] be the part of the exterior differential operator which maps forms of type (0,q) to forms of type (0,q + 1). We extend [formula] to [formula] by

[formula]

where [formula], where [formula] is defined in the sense of distributions. We write

[formula]

to denote the Hilbert space adjoint of [formula] in the L2 space with respect to ( | )k. Let [formula] denote the Gaffney extension of the Kodaira Laplacian given by

[formula]

where

[formula]

By a result of Gaffney [\cite=MM07], [formula] is a positive self-adjoint operator. Let

[formula]

be the Bergman projection, i.e. the orthogonal projection onto [formula] with respect to ( | )k and let Π(q)k(z,w) be the distribution kernel of Π(q)k with respect to the volume form dm. Since [formula] is elliptic, it is not difficult to see that

[formula]

We write [formula].

It is well-known that [formula] has spectral gap ≥  Ck, for k large, where C > 0 is a constant independent of k. From this observation and Theorem 4.12, Theorem 4.14 in [\cite=HM11], we deduce the following

Let 0  ≤  q  ≤  n. If q  ≠  n-, then e- kφ(z)Π(q)k(z,w)ekφ(w) is negligible. If q = n-, then

[formula]

for [formula], [formula], where

[formula]

in [formula],

[formula]

[formula], r(z,w,k) is negligible and [formula], ψ(z,z) = 0, [formula], [formula], c > 0. For z = w, we have

[formula]

Moreover,

[formula]

vanishes to infinity order on z = w. Furthermore, the Taylor expansion of the phase ψ(z,w) is uniquely determined at each point of z = w.

In particular,

[formula]

The leading term b0(z,z) is essentially well-known (see formula (1.24) in Ma-Marinescu [\cite=MM06])

Let q = n-. For [formula], we assume that λj(p), [formula], are the eigenvalues of [formula] with respect to ( | ) and that λj(p) < 0 if 1  ≤  j  ≤  n-. Let [formula] be an orthonormal basis of [formula] such that [formula], [formula]. Let [formula], [formula], denote the orthonormal basis of [formula], which is dual to [formula], [formula]. Then,

[formula]

The main result

In order to state our result precisely, we have to introduce some notations and definitions. Let

[formula]

be a linear operaor, where [formula], [formula]. We write [formula], [formula], 1  ≤  j,k  ≤  n,

[formula]

[formula]. We have

[formula]

where [formula].

Let [formula] be another linear operator, where [formula], [formula]. We write [formula], [formula], [formula], as in [\eqref=s1-e12]. Then

[formula]

is the linear operator defined by [formula], [formula].

We assume that F is smooth. That is,

[formula]

Let

[formula]

be the smooth linear operator defined by [formula], [formula]. Similarly,

[formula]

is the smooth linear operator defined by [formula], [formula].

Let

[formula]

be the smooth linear map defined by

[formula]

[formula]. Note that [formula] in the sense of [\eqref=s1-e11]. We write [formula] to denote the inverse of Mφ.

We recall that we work with the assumption that Mφ is non-degenerate of constant signature (n-,n+). For [formula], we can diagonalize Mφ(z), i.e. we can find an orthonormal basis [formula] of [formula] such that Mφ(z)Uj(z) = λj(z)Uj(z), [formula], [formula], [formula]. From now on, we assume that

[formula]

Let W+ be the subbundle of [formula] spanned by [formula] and let W- be the subbundle of [formula] spanned by [formula]. We take the Hermitian metric [formula] on [formula] such that [formula], [formula] if U,V∈W+, [formula] if U,V∈W-. The Hermitian metric [formula] on [formula] induces a Hermitian metric on [formula] also denoted by [formula].

The two form [formula] induces a connection Dφ on the bundle [formula]:

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula], [formula]. We call θ the connection matrix for [formula]. The curvature of the connection Dφ is given by

[formula]

For [formula], define

[formula]

Define

[formula]

It is not difficult to see that the definition [\eqref=s1-e21] is independent of the choices of eigenvectors [formula].

Define

[formula]

Put [formula], [formula], where Uj, [formula], are as in [\eqref=s1-e17]. The main result of this work is the following

Under the assumptions and notations above, let q = n-. For [formula] and for b1 in [\eqref=s1-e9], we have

[formula]

where for [formula],

[formula]

It is straight forward to see that the right side of [\eqref=s1-e26-I] is real (see [\eqref=s5-e17]) and is independent of the choices of eigenvectors [formula].

The Taylor expansion of ψ(z,w) at z = w

From now on, we assume that q = n-. The goal of this work is to compute Tr  b1(p,p), for [formula]. We may assume that p = 0 and by taking unitary transformation, we can assume that near 0,

[formula]

where [formula] are eigenvalues of Mφ, [formula], [formula], [formula]. Put [formula] and let [formula] be the Bergman projection with respect to [formula] as in [\eqref=s1-e5]. It is easy to see that

[formula]

Thus, the coefficients of the asymptotic expansion of the kernel of Π(q)k on the diagonal are the same as the coefficients of the asymptotic expansion of the kernel of [formula].

From the discussion above, we may assume that

[formula]

near z = 0. Suppose that λj < 0, [formula], and λj > 0, [formula]. In this section, we are going to compute the Taylor expansion of ψ(z,w) at z = w = 0. We introduce some notations. For [formula], [formula], [formula], we put [formula], [formula]. We write [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula]. The main goal of this section is to prove the following

Under the assumptions and notations before, we have

[formula]

in some neighborhood of 0. Moreover, we have

[formula]

where q + 1  ≤  j  ≤  n, 1  ≤  k  ≤  q,

[formula]

where q + 1  ≤  j,k  ≤  n, and

[formula]

where 1  ≤  j,k  ≤  q.

To prove Theorem [\ref=s2-t1], we first need the following (see [\cite=Hsiao08], for a proof)

Under the assumptions above, we have

[formula]

near z = w = 0.

From [\eqref=s2-e1] and [\eqref=s2-e6], we may write

[formula]

where ψj(z,w) is a homogeneous polynomial of degree j in (z,w), [formula], and

[formula]

where φj(z) is a homogeneous polynomial of degree j in z, [formula]. Now, using [\eqref=s2-e7] and [\eqref=s2-e8] in [\eqref=s1-e8], we get

[formula]

We regroup the terms in [\eqref=s2-e9] according to the order. Then, the order three and order four terms are the following

[formula]

[formula]

where

[formula]

Let

[formula]

where ψj3 is a homogeneous polynomial of degree j in w, j = 0,1,2,3. Now, we write [\eqref=s2-e10] according to the degree of homogenity in w, we get

[formula]

We need

We use the same notations as before. Let where [formula], [formula], [formula], and similar for β, γ, δ. If Tg = h, then

[formula]

From the definition of T (see [\eqref=s2-e12]), we can compute if (α'',β') = 0, and if [formula]. From this, the lemma follows.

We have [formula], where [formula] and similar for β!. From this, we can compute

[formula]

From [\eqref=s2-e17], [\eqref=s2-e18] and [\eqref=s2-e19], we deduce that

[formula]

where [formula] if [formula].

Now, we compute ψ13. From [\eqref=s2-e20], it is straight forward to see that

[formula]

where 1  ≤  j  ≤  q and

[formula]

where q + 1  ≤  j  ≤  n. From [\eqref=s2-e21] and [\eqref=s2-e22], we can check that From this, we deduce that

[formula]

where [formula] if [formula].

Now, we compute ψ23. From [\eqref=s2-e23], we can compute

[formula]

and

[formula]

We rewrite the last equation in [\eqref=s2-e24]:

[formula]

Similarly, we rewrite the last equation in [\eqref=s2-e25],

[formula]

Combining [\eqref=s2-e26], [\eqref=s2-e27] with [\eqref=s2-e24] and [\eqref=s2-e25], we obtain

[formula]

From this and Lemma [\ref=s2-l1], we get

[formula]

where [formula] if [formula]. Summing up, we get the following

Under the assumptions and notations before, we have

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] if [formula].

Now, we are readay to compute [formula], where [formula] and (α'',β') = 0. We compute [formula], 1  ≤  s0  ≤  q, q + 1  ≤  j0,k0  ≤  n. From [formula], we have

[formula]

To compute [formula], it is equivalent to compute [formula]. From [\eqref=s1-e7], we know that

[formula]

Differentiate [\eqref=s2-e32] with respect to [formula], we get

[formula]

Again, differentiate [\eqref=s2-e33] with respect to zs0, we get

[formula]

From [\eqref=s2-e34], we have

[formula]

In view of [\eqref=s2-e30], we see that

[formula]

Combining this with [\eqref=s2-e35], we have

[formula]

From [\eqref=s2-e31], we obtain

[formula]

We can repeat the method above several times to determine all the terms [formula], (α'',β') = 0. The computation is straight forward. We omit the process. We state our result

Under the assumptions and notations before, we have

[formula]

in some neighborhood of 0.

Now, to complete the proof of Theorem [\ref=s2-t1], we only need to compute the terms [formula], 1  ≤  j,k  ≤  n. We go through the steps in the computation of the case: q + 1  ≤  j  ≤  n, 1  ≤  k  ≤  q. The computations of the cases: 1  ≤  j,k  ≤  q and q + 1  ≤  j,k  ≤  n, are similar but simpler and is therefore omitted. Now, we compute [formula], q + 1  ≤  j0  ≤  n, 1  ≤  k0  ≤  q. Take w = 0 in [\eqref=s2-e11], we obtain

[formula]

We write where [formula] and [formula]. From Proposition [\ref=s2-p2], it is straight forward to see that if 1  ≤  t  ≤  q, then and If q + 1  ≤  t  ≤  n, we have and

Now, using [\eqref=s2-e40] in [\eqref=s2-e39], we can check that

[formula]

where [formula]. We recall that T is given by [\eqref=s2-e12]. From [\eqref=s2-e45], we have

[formula]

From [\eqref=s2-e41]-[\eqref=s2-e44] and [\eqref=s2-e46], it is straight forward to see that

[formula]

Similarly, we can repeat the procedure above with minor change and get

[formula]

where q + 1  ≤  j0,k0  ≤  n, and

[formula]

where 1  ≤  j0,k0  ≤  q.

From [\eqref=s2-e47], [\eqref=s2-e48], [\eqref=s2-e49] and Proposition [\ref=s2-p2], Theorem [\ref=s2-t1] follows.

The transport equations for [formula]

The transport equations

In this section, we will write down the transport equations for [formula] and we will solve the first transport equation at z = w in some sence. The main reference for this section is [\cite=BS05]. We first derive representations for [formula], [formula] in spaces without exponential weights, by using the following unitary identifications:

[formula]

Using [\eqref=s3-e1], we get

[formula]

where

[formula]

Now the formal adjoint of [formula] for the inner product ( | ) given by [\eqref=s1-e2] is

[formula]

where in view of the unitarity of the relation [\eqref=s3-e1],

[formula]

We can identify the Kodaira Laplacian with

[formula]

Put

[formula]

be the orthogonal projection with respect to ( | ) and let Π̂(q)k(z,w) be the distribution kernel of Π̂(q)k. From [\eqref=s3-e2] and [\eqref=s3-e5], we have

[formula]

In view of Theorem [\ref=s1-t1], we see that

[formula]

where [formula] in [formula] and S(z,w,k) is negligible.

From [\eqref=s3-e3] and [\eqref=s3-e9], we have

[formula]

From this and [\eqref=s3-e4], we can compute

[formula]

Similarly, we have

[formula]

Combining [\eqref=s3-e11], [\eqref=s3-e12] with [formula], we get

[formula]

We regroup [\eqref=s3-e13] according to the degree of k and notice that the leading term in [\eqref=s3-e13] vanishes to infinite order on z = w and (q)kΠ̂(q)k = 0, we obtain the following

We have

[formula]

vanishes to infinite order on z = w and

[formula]

vanishes to infinite order on z = w.

The first order of the Taylor expansion of b0(z,w) at z = w

Now, as in section 2, we assume that [formula] near 0 and that λj < 0, [formula] and λj > 0, [formula]. We work in some neighborhood of (0,0). Put

[formula]

where bj0 is a homogeneous polynomialof degree j in (z,w). We recall that (See Theorem [\ref=s1-t2].) For 1  ≤  s  ≤  n, put χ1(s) = 1 if 1  ≤  s  ≤  q and χ1(s) = 0 if q + 1  ≤  s  ≤  n and put χ2(s) = 1 - χ1(s). We recall that for any operator [formula], the trace of T is given by [\eqref=s1-e-1]. The first goal of this section is to prove the following

Under the notations above, we have

[formula]

As in section 2, we write

[formula]

and

[formula]

where ψj(z,w) is a homogeneous polynomial of degree j in (z,w), [formula], φj(z) is a homogeneous polynomial of degree j in z, [formula]. Now, using [\eqref=s3-e16], [\eqref=s3-e18] and [\eqref=s3-e19] in [\eqref=s3-e14], we get

[formula]

It is straight forward to see that the order 1 and 2 terms in [\eqref=s3-e20] are the following

[formula]

and

[formula]

where

[formula]

We rewrite first term of the right side of [\eqref=s3-e21]:

[formula]

Note that [formula]. From the form of b00 (see Theorem [\ref=s1-t2]), we can check that [formula] if q + 1  ≤  j  ≤  n, [formula] if 1  ≤  j  ≤  q, [formula] if 1  ≤  j  ≤  q, [formula] if q + 1  ≤  j  ≤  n and when j  ≠  t, [formula] if and only if q + 1  ≤  j  ≤  n and 1  ≤  t  ≤  q. From this observaton, [\eqref=s3-e24] becomes

[formula]

From [\eqref=s2-e30], it is straight forward to see that

[formula]

where 1  ≤  j  ≤  q and

[formula]

where q + 1  ≤  j  ≤  n. From [\eqref=s3-e25], [\eqref=s3-e26] and [\eqref=s3-e27], [\eqref=s3-e21] becomes

[formula]

Now, we write [\eqref=s3-e28] according to the degree of homogenity in w, we get

[formula]

and

[formula]

We pause and introduce some notations. For multi-index J, we write [formula], [formula], if [formula], [formula]. Set [formula], [formula]. Then, [formula], [formula], [formula], is an orthonormal basis of [formula], where 0 is the origin in [formula]. Let [formula], [formula], [formula], be the [formula]-linear operator:

[formula]

It is clear that [formula], [formula], [formula], is a basis of the vector space [formula]. For [formula], put For multi-index J, [formula], we define

[formula]

Put [formula]. Note that F(J)  ≠  0 if and only if J  ≠  I0. We have the following

We use the same notations as in the discussion before Theorem [\ref=s2-t1] and before. If we consider L as the operator (We recall that L is given by [\eqref=s3-e23].) Then,

[formula]

Moreover, for [formula], we write [formula]. If cα,β,γ,δJ,I0 = 0 when (α'',β') = 0. Then, we have LB = A, where

[formula]

where u∈Ker  L.

We recall that For [formula], [formula], [formula], we have

[formula]

and if I  ≠  J. Thus,

[formula]

From [\eqref=s3-e35], the lemma follows.

It is not difficult to see that [formula] and

[formula]

where q + 1  ≤  j  ≤  n, 1  ≤  t  ≤  q. Combining this with [\eqref=s3-e29] and Lemma [\ref=s3-l1], we get the following

We have that

[formula]

where u(z)∈Ker  L.

Now, we compute b10(0,w). From [\eqref=s3-e36], we can compute the last two terms of the right side of [\eqref=s3-e30]:

[formula]

Combining this with [\eqref=s3-e30], we obtain

[formula]

From this, [\eqref=s3-e35-1] and Lemma [\ref=s3-l1], we get

We have that

[formula]

where v(w)∈Ker  L.

In view of Proposition [\ref=s3-p2], we know that to prove Theorem [\ref=s3-t1], we only need to compute u(z), where u(z) is as in [\eqref=s3-e36]. Now, we compute u(z). Note that u(z)∈Ker  L. From Lemma [\ref=s3-l1], we may write

[formula]

where [formula], for all [formula], [formula], [formula], J  ≠  I0. Let u*(z) be the adjoint of u(z) with respect to ( | ) in the space [formula]. We can check that

[formula]

We notice that the Bergman projection Π(q)k is self-adjoint. From this observation, we deduce that

[formula]

where (b10(w,0))* is the adjoint of b10(w,0) with respect to the inner product ( | ) in the space [formula]. From [\eqref=s3-e36] and [\eqref=s3-e41] and recall that Ker  L is given by [\eqref=s3-e33], we deduce that

[formula]

where r(w)∈Ker  L. From [\eqref=s3-e39] and [\eqref=s3-e35-1], we have

[formula]

where v(w)∈Ker  L. From [\eqref=s3-e42], [\eqref=s3-e43] and [\eqref=s3-e44], we get

[formula]

Combining above with [\eqref=s3-e40] and [\eqref=s3-e35-1], we obtain

[formula]

Now, to complete the proof of Theorem [\ref=s3-t1], we only need to know cs, [formula]. From [\eqref=s3-e47], we know that

[formula]

From Theorem [\ref=s1-t2], we know that [formula]. From this, we can compute

[formula]

From [\eqref=s3-e42], we know that [formula]. Note that b10(z,z) = b10(z,0) + b10(0,z). From this, we see that

[formula]

Thus, if q + 1  ≤  s  ≤  n, from [\eqref=s3-e48] and [\eqref=s3-e50], we can check that

[formula]

From [\eqref=s3-e49] and [\eqref=s3-e51], we can compute

[formula]

q + 1  ≤  s  ≤  n. Similarly, we can repeat the procedure above and get

[formula]

if 1  ≤  s  ≤  q. Combining [\eqref=s3-e53], [\eqref=s3-e52] with [\eqref=s3-e47], Theorem [\ref=s3-t1] follows.

The second order of the Taylor expansion of b0(z,w) at z = w and the b1 term

The second goal of this section is to prove the following

Put

[formula]

Then for b20(z,w) in [\eqref=s3-e16], we have

[formula]

where Tr  h = 0 and [formula], [formula].

Furthermore, we have

[formula]

where [formula], Tr  R = 0.

Take w = 0 in [\eqref=s3-e22], we get

[formula]

where and

First, we deal with the sum I. From the form of b00, we can check that

[formula]

where Tr  h1 = 0 and [formula], [formula].

Now, we deal with the sum II. From[\eqref=s3-e17], we may write

[formula]

where [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula]. We note that as, bs, [formula], are the same as in [\eqref=s3-e54]. For [formula], [formula] and [formula], we can check that

[formula]

We notice that [formula]. Similarly, For [formula], [formula] and [formula], we can check that

[formula]

From [\eqref=s3-e57], [\eqref=s3-e58] and [\eqref=s3-e59], it is straight forward to see that

[formula]

where Tr  h2 = 0 and [formula], [formula].

From [\eqref=s2-e2] and [\eqref=s3-e17], it is straight forward to see that [\eqref=s3-e60] becomes:

[formula]

Now, we deal with the sum III. From [\eqref=s2-e2], [\eqref=s3-e17] and [\eqref=s3-e57], we can check that

[formula]

where Tr  h3 = 0 and [formula], [formula].

From [\eqref=s3-e62], [\eqref=s3-e61] and [\eqref=s3-e56], [\eqref=s3-e55] becomes

[formula]

where Tr  h4 = 0 and [formula], [formula]. We notice that [formula]. From this observation and Lemma [\ref=s3-l1], we get [\eqref=s3-e54-1].

Now, to complete the proof of Theorem [\ref=s3-t2], we only need to prove [\eqref=s3-e54-2]. From [\eqref=s3-e15] and [\eqref=s2-e2], we see that

[formula]

From [\eqref=s3-e54-1], we see that

[formula]

where [formula] and Tr  f = 0. Since we can solve [\eqref=s3-e64], we conclude that α = 0. Thus, [\eqref=s3-e64] becomes:

[formula]

Again, from Lemma [\ref=s3-l1], we get [\eqref=s3-e54-2]. Theorem [\ref=s3-t2] follows.

The trace of the b1 term

As before, in this section, we assume that [formula] near 0 and that λj < 0, [formula], and λj > 0, [formula]. We work in some neighborhood of (0,0) and we shall use the same notaions as before. In view of [\eqref=s3-e54-2], we know that

[formula]

where [formula], Tr  R = 0. The main goal of this section is to determine the constant c. We notice that the projection Π̂(q)k has the following property:

[formula]

We recall that Π̂(q)k is given by [\eqref=s3-e7]. From [\eqref=s3-e9], we have

[formula]

where F(u,w,k) is negligible. Take u = w = 0 in [\eqref=s4-e3] and from [\eqref=s4-e2] and [\eqref=s3-e9], we get

[formula]

We use zj = x2j - 1 + ix2j, [formula]. We write ∂xj to denote the operator [formula], [formula]. For multi-indix [formula], [formula], [formula]. We write [formula] if [formula] and we write ∂αx to denote the operator [formula]. We recall the stationary phase formula of Hörmander (see Theorem 7.7.5 in Hörmander  [\cite=Hor03])

Let [formula] be a compact set, X an open neighborhood of K and N a positive integer. If u∈C∞0(K), f∈C∞(X) and [formula] in X, Im  f(x0) = 0, f'(x0) = 0, [formula], [formula] in [formula] then

[formula]

where C is bounded when f stays in a bounded set in C∞(X) and [formula] has a uniform bounded and

[formula]

Here

[formula]

and [formula].

Now, we apply [\eqref=s4-e5] to the left side of [\eqref=s4-e4]. From [\eqref=s2-e2], we know that

[formula]

Since Im  (ψ(0,z) + ψ(z,0)) > 0 when [formula], we may assume that b(0,z,k) has compact supports in some small neighborhood K of [formula]. From [\eqref=s4-e5], we have

[formula]

We can check that

[formula]

The computation of the term L1(b(0,z,k)b(z,0,k))|z = 0 is straight forward. We omit the process. We state our result

Under the notations above, we have

[formula]

From [\eqref=s4-e4], [\eqref=s4-e9], [\eqref=s4-e9-1] and [\eqref=s4-e10], we get the following

We have

[formula]

where C0 denote the right side of [\eqref=s4-e10].

For [formula], we write [formula] if (Au | Bu) = 0 for all [formula]. For [formula], we werit [formula] to denote the component of A in the direction [formula]. More precisely, if

[formula]

then [formula]. Now, we are ready to compute the constant c. We recall that c is given by [\eqref=s4-e1]. From [\eqref=s4-e1], we know that

[formula]

Note that b0(0,0) = b00. From [\eqref=s4-e1], [\eqref=s4-e11] and [\eqref=s4-e13], we get

[formula]

Now, we compute Ĉ0. The computation is very complicate. We only give the outline of the computation. We write C0 = I + II + III + IV + V, where

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

Now, we deal with the sum I. From [\eqref=s3-e17] and [\eqref=s3-e54-1], we may write

[formula]

where

[formula]

[formula], [formula], Tr  h = 0 and [formula], [formula]. As in section 3, for [formula], we write u*(z) to denote the adjoint of u(z) with respect to ( | ) in [formula]. We notice that

[formula]

From this and [\eqref=s4-e16], we deduce that

[formula]

Note that we still have Tr  h* = 0 and [formula], [formula]. From [\eqref=s4-e16] and [\eqref=s4-e17], we can check that

[formula]

where [formula]. From [\eqref=s3-e17], [\eqref=s3-e54-1] and the fourth order Taylor expansion of the phase ψ (see [\eqref=s2-e3] [\eqref=s2-e4] and [\eqref=s2-e5]), we can write down the explicit formula of the right side of [\eqref=s4-e18]. The computation is very complicate but elemenrary and is therefore omitted. We state our result

For I in [\eqref=s4-e15-1], we have

[formula]

where [formula] and

[formula]

Now, we deal with the sum II. From [\eqref=s2-e3], [\eqref=s2-e4] and [\eqref=s2-e5], we can check that

[formula]

where

[formula]

Now, we deal wih the sum III, IV and V. First we need the following theorem which follows from Theorem [\ref=s2-t1]

We have that

[formula]

Note that and [formula]. From this and [\eqref=s4-e25], we can check that

[formula]

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

From [\eqref=s4-e28], [\eqref=s4-e27], [\eqref=s4-e26], [\eqref=s4-e23], [\eqref=s4-e21], [\eqref=s4-e15] and some straight forward computations, we get the main result of this section

For c in [\eqref=s4-e1], we have

[formula]

The end of the proof of Theorem [\ref=t-main]

In this section, we will use the same notations as in section 1. Let

and

[formula]

be linear operaors, where [formula], [formula]. We write [formula], [formula], 1  ≤  j,k  ≤  n, and [formula], [formula], [formula], as in [\eqref=s1-e12]. [formula] is the linear operator defined by [formula], [formula]. We have [formula]. We can compute

[formula]

For [formula], we may assume that p = 0 and [formula] near 0 and as before we suppose that λj < 0, [formula], and λj > 0, [formula]. Let [formula] be as in [\eqref=s1-e15]. We recall that [formula]. We have

[formula]

where Uj, [formula], are given by [\eqref=s1-e17]. Moreover, we have

[formula]

Here δj,k = 1 if j = k, δj,k = 0 if j  ≠  k. For the definition of the Hermitian metrix [formula], see the discussion after [\eqref=s1-e17].

Put [formula]. We claim that

[formula]

[formula]

Thus, [formula]. [\eqref=s5-e2] follows.

Let [formula] be as in [\eqref=s1-e21]. We write [formula], [formula] at 0, where

[formula]

We recall that the definition of δk(j) is given by [\eqref=s1-e20]. Put [formula]. From [\eqref=s5-e2], we see that

[formula]

at 0. Put [formula]. From [\eqref=s5-e1], [\eqref=s5-e5], we see that

We have that

[formula]

where q + 1  ≤  j,k  ≤  n,

[formula]

where 1  ≤  j,k  ≤  q,

[formula]

where q + 1  ≤  j  ≤  n, 1  ≤  k  ≤  q, and

[formula]

where 1  ≤  j  ≤  q, q + 1  ≤  k  ≤  n.

Let [formula] be as in [\eqref=s1-e19]. We recall that [formula], where [formula], [formula]. It is not difficult to see that

[formula]

where q + 1  ≤  j  ≤  n, 1  ≤  k  ≤  q, and

[formula]

where 1  ≤  j  ≤  q, q + 1  ≤  k  ≤  n.

As in section 1, define

[formula]

From [\eqref=s5-e8]-[\eqref=s5-e11] and [\eqref=s5-e13]-[\eqref=s5-e14], it is not difficult to see that

[formula]

From [\eqref=s5-e4], we can check that

[formula]

at 0. From this, it is straight forward to see that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Combining [\eqref=s5-e19], [\eqref=s5-e18] and [\eqref=s5-e17] with [\eqref=s4-e29], Theorem [\ref=t-main] follows.
