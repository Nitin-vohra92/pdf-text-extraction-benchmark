Sharp heat kernel estimates in the Fourier-Bessel setting for a continuous range of the type parameter

Introduction

Let Jν denote the Bessel function of the first kind and order ν  >   - 1, and let {λn,ν:n  ≥  1} be the sequence of successive positive zeros of Jν. The Fourier-Bessel heat kernel is given by the oscillating sum

[formula]

The numbers λ2n,ν and the functions [formula] occurring here are the eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions, respectively, of the Bessel differential operator [formula] considered on the interval (0,1). It is well known that this kernel gives the solution of the initial-value problem for the Bessel heat equation on (0,1) with Dirichlet boundary condition at the right endpoint.

Our main result is the following qualitatively sharp description of Gνt(x,y).

The main contents of Theorem [\ref=thm:main] are of course the short time bounds. Proving them by a direct analysis of the heavily oscillating series in [\eqref=ker_Bessel] is practically impossible. Note that the Bessel function Jν is transcendental in general, and can be expressed by means of elementary functions only if the index ν is half-integer, i.e. ν  =  k / 2 for some integer k. Furthermore, the zeros of Jν are known explicitly only when ν  =    ±  1 / 2. Note also that the order of magnitude of the numbers λ2n,ν appearing in the exponential factor is n2 as n  →    ∞  ; in particular, the asymptotic distribution of λ2n,ν is not linear.

The behavior of the Fourier-Bessel heat kernel does not seem to have been studied before, except for our previous paper [\cite=NR]. More precisely, in [\cite=NR] we derived qualitatively sharp estimates for Gνt(x,y) under the assumption that ν is a half-integer not less than - 1 / 2 (actually, this restriction is essential only for the short time bounds, see [\cite=NR]). We also conjectured analogous estimates for general ν  >   - 1, see [\cite=NR], which are now confirmed by Theorem [\ref=thm:main]. However, the methods we use in the present paper are much different from those applied in [\cite=NR]. Here the main argument is based on a relation we establish between the Fourier-Bessel setting and the framework related to Jacobi 'functions'. This makes it possible to transfer qualitatively sharp estimates of the Jacobi heat kernel obtained recently by Coulhon, Kerkyacharian and Petrushev [\cite=CKP] and independently by Nowak and Sjögren [\cite=NS]. We remark that actually in [\cite=CKP] heat kernel estimates were established in a very general setting but, nevertheless, they do not apply directly to the Fourier-Bessel case.

Our principal motivation for investigating Gνt(x,y) comes from an interest in harmonic analysis related to Fourier-Bessel expansions, see the references in [\cite=NR]. Additional motivation emerges from the probabilistic interpretation of the Fourier-Bessel heat kernel, see [\cite=KM]. Namely, it is a transition probability density for the time scaled Bessel process Xν + 1 / 22t on (0,  ∞  ) (with reflecting barrier at x = 0 when - 1 < ν < 0, see [\cite=BS]) killed upon leaving the interval (0,1). We also note that for ν = d / 2 - 1, d  ≥  1, the kernel Gνt(x,y) provides a fundamental solution to the standard heat equation in the d-dimensional Euclidean unit ball with Dirichlet boundary condition and a radial initial condition.

There are two simple cases occurring already in Fourier's works, at least implicitly. These are G-  1 / 2t(x,y) and G1 / 2t(x,y), and the two kernels can be written by means of non-oscillating series, see [\cite=NR]. The argument is based on the periodized Gauss-Weierstrass kernel and simple boundary-value problems for the classical heat equation in an interval. No more elementary representations in these cases seem to be possible, and this suggests that a general closed explicit formula for Gνt(x,y) does not exist. The estimates in Theorem [\ref=thm:main] are therefore a natural and desirable substitute for an exact expression.

The operator [formula] is symmetric and nonnegative on C2c(0,1)  ⊂  L2(dx). Similarly as in the previous setting, there is a natural self-adjoint extension of [formula] in L2(dx), denoted by [formula], whose spectral decomposition is given by the ψνn. The associated heat semigroup [formula] possesses an integral representation (with integration against dx), and the relevant kernel is

this identity is understood in the limiting sense whenever x = 0 or y = 0.

Finally, we introduce the Jacobi setting based on Jacobi trigonometric 'functions', see [\cite=NS], scaled to the interval

These estimates are crucial for our reasoning proving Theorem [\ref=thm:main].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:main]

We first focus on showing the short time bounds, which constitute the main part of Theorem [\ref=thm:main]. Our argument relies on relating the Fourier-Bessel heat kernel [formula] with the Jacobi heat kernel [formula] and then transferring the estimates of Theorem [\ref=thm:Jacobi]. This will be achieved by proving that the generator of the Fourier-Bessel semigroup [formula] is a 'slight' perturbation of the Jacobi generator with the parameters of type α  =  ν and β = 1 / 2. Then the desired relation will follow by the so-called Trotter product formula.

A close connection between the generators is suggested by a relation at the level of differential operators. Observe that [formula] and [formula] differ only by a zero order term,
