Multiplicative inverses in short intervals

Introduction and results

T.D. Browning and A. Haynes [\cite=BrHa] considered the following problem. Let p be a prime, J be an integer and I(j)1,I(j)2 with 1  ≤  j  ≤  J be finite sequences of subintervals of (0,p). Under which conditions is there a j such that

[formula]

has a solution? They proved the following.

Let H,K > 0 and let I(j)1,I(j)2  ⊆  (0,p) be subintervals, for 1  ≤  j  ≤  J, such that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Then there exists j∈{1,...,J} for which [\eqref=congruence] has a solution if

[formula]

The proof of this theorem in [\cite=BrHa] relies on the following new mean value theorem for short Kloosterman sums by Browning and Haynes.

If I1,...,IJ  ⊆  (0,p) are disjoint subintervals, with H / 2  ≤  |Ij|  ≤  H for each j, then for any [formula], we have

[formula]

In this note, we prove Theorem [\ref=theorem1], in a slightly generalized and refined form, by a different method which doesn't use Theorem [\ref=theorem2] but Poisson summation and Weil's estimate for Kloosterman sums. Moreover, we improve this result under certain additional conditions on the spacing of the intervals I(j)i.

We note that we could add the assumption

[formula]

to Theorem [\ref=theorem1] without weakening the result because J  ≪  p / H under the conditions of this theorem which contradicts [\eqref=Jineq] if H <  log p since K  ≤  p. We want to assume [\eqref=Hass] throughout the sequel. Moreover, we want to assume without loss of generality that the intervals I(j)1 and I(j)2 are closed and centered at integers Nj and Mj, respectively. We prove the following.

Assume that all conditions in Theorem [\ref=theorem1] are satisfied, except possibly [\eqref=empty]. Assume the integers Mj are X-spaced modulo p, i.e.

[formula]

for some X  ≥  1, where ||z|| denotes the distance of the real number z to the nearest integer. Then there exists j∈{1,...,J} for which [\eqref=congruence] has a solution if

[formula]

Clearly, Theorem [\ref=theorem3] implies Theorem [\ref=theorem1]. If the intervals I(j)1 and I(j)2 are equispaced, respectively, we obtain an improvement of the result above, provided that the intervals I(j)1 are not spaced too far away.

Assume that all conditions in Theorem [\ref=theorem1] are satisfied. Assume further that the integers Mj and Nj lie in arithmetic progression, respectively, i.e.

[formula]

for certain integers M,N,X,Y and all j∈{1,...,J}. Then there exists j∈{1,...,J} for which [\eqref=congruence] has a solution if

[formula]

Basic approach

Set

[formula]

This has Fourier transform

[formula]

Set

[formula]

and

[formula]

where here and in the sequel, we assume that (n,p) = 1, and [formula] denotes the multiplicative inverse of n modulo p. Then clearly, [\eqref=congruence] has a solution if T > 0. Now the general strategy is to extend the sums over m and n to all integers and use Poisson summation and Weil's estimate for Kloosterman sums.

We write

[formula]

where

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

From J,H,K  ≤  p (J  ≤  p following from X  ≥  1), [\eqref=Fourier] and [\eqref=6], it is evident that S1 and S2 are negligible, i.e.

[formula]

In the following section, we estimate the sum S.

Application of Poisson summation

We have Using Poisson summation, the terms in the last line can be transformed as follow. First, Second, Third, where

[formula]

is the Kloosterman sum. Putting the above together, we get

[formula]

We note that if - (p - 1) / 2  ≤  k  ≤  (p - 1) / 2, then

[formula]

since x  ≥  1 if ε  ≤  1 / 2 by [\eqref=Hass] and [\eqref=6].

Proof of Theorem 3

By Weil's bound for Kloosterman sums, we have

[formula]

Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and [\eqref=Fkx], it follows that

[formula]

Expanding the square, we get Using [\eqref=Fkx], we have

[formula]

Similarly,

[formula]

Moreover, removing the weight function Fk(x) using partial summation and using the familiar estimate for geometric sums, we have

[formula]

It follows that

[formula]

Using the fact that the Mj's are X-spaced modulo p, we obtain

[formula]

Combining [\eqref=write], [\eqref=negligible], [\eqref=above], [\eqref=aftercauchy], [\eqref=ale] and [\eqref=last], we arrive at

[formula]

For the right-hand side to be greater 0 (i.e. error term <   main term), it suffices that

[formula]

which holds if [\eqref=Jlowerbound] is satisfied. This implies Theorem [\ref=theorem3].

Proof of Theorem 4

Under the conditions of Theorem 4, we have

[formula]

Using [\eqref=Weil] and [\eqref=geom], we obtain

[formula]

We estimate the inner-most sum over k by where we use [\eqref=Fkx] and X  ≥  x (which follows from [\eqref=empty]). Hence, we get

[formula]

Combining [\eqref=write], [\eqref=negligible], [\eqref=above], [\eqref=follows] and [\eqref=hence], we get

[formula]

For the right-hand side to be greater 0, it suffices that

[formula]

which holds if [\eqref=has] is satisfied. This implies Theorem [\ref=theorem4].
