Curvature Induced Activation of a Passive Tracer in an Active Bath

Introduction -In recent years, the behavior and dynamics of microstructures and colloidal particles immersed in an active fluid (e.g. bacteria, self-propelled nanoparticles, artificial microswimmers, etc.) have drawn considerable interest. The inherently non-equilibrium driving forces and stochastic nature of an active fluid give rise to phenomenological behavior that is quite remarkable including anomalous diffusion [\cite=chen2007] [\cite=wu2000] [\cite=mino2011] [\cite=leptos2009] [\cite=morozov] [\cite=valeriani2011], tunable effective interactions between suspended microcomponents [\cite=angelani2011] [\cite=harder2014] [\cite=reichardt2014] [\cite=ni2014], and targeted delivery of colloids [\cite=palacci2013] [\cite=koumakis2013]. In addition, there has recently been an effort to understand the dynamics, phase behavior, and self-assembly properties of suspensions of deformable [\cite=ohta2009] [\cite=menzel2012] and/or irregular shaped active particles [\cite=wensink2014] [\cite=nguyen2014]. An emerging area in this field is designing microstructures to perform specific tasks when immersed in an active suspension, most notably driving microscopic gears and motors [\cite=dileonardo2010] [\cite=angelani2009], the capture and rectification of active particles [\cite=ghosh2013] [\cite=wan2008] [\cite=galajda2007] [\cite=kaiser2012] [\cite=kaiser2013], and using active suspensions to propel wedge-like carriers [\cite=angelani2010] [\cite=kaiser2014]. The geometry of these microdevices is a crucial component to being able to effectively convert the energy from the active environment into mechanical work. Interestingly, Angelani and Di Leonardo [\cite=angelani2010] showed that chevron shaped micro-shuttles immersed in a bacterial suspension undergo directed motion along their axis of symmetry. A similar observation was made experimentally by Kaiser et al. [\cite=kaiser2014] who showed that chevron shaped particles can be set into rectified motion along their wedge cusp when immersed in a high density bacterial suspension. Given these results, it is well established that asymmetric tracers with locally concave regions (e.g. wedge, chevron, lock and key colloids, etc.) are able to undergo rectified motion in an active fluid, while spherical tracers only undergo enhanced isotropic diffusion [\cite=wu2000] [\cite=morozov] [\cite=valeriani2011]. Intriguingly and in stark contrast to a tracer in a passive environment, the transport properties of a tracer immersed in an active fluid are strongly dependent on its underlying geometry. In short, a tracer in an active environment can be made active in its own right by simply altering its shape.

In an effort to characterize this unique phenomenon, we systematically distort the geometry of a rod shaped tracer and study the resulting dynamics in an active medium. Our goal is to understand the transition from isotropic to directed motion as a function of tracer geometry. In previous studies, the rectification of the random motion of the bacteria is caused by polar ordering and trapping of bacteria inside the cusp regions of the tracer. We however consider a low-density suspension of non-aligning active particles. This choice is motivated by the recent developments in the design and synthesis of artificial self-propelled particles [\cite=Theurkauff2012] [\cite=palacci2013] [\cite=Buttinoni2] [\cite=sacanna2], as well as to eliminate the polar ordering and trapping which is typical of high density bacterial suspensions, and be able to focus exclusively on the effect of the particle activity disregarding collective effects that may ensue due to excluded volume interactions at larger concentrations. Our results show that directed motion of the tracer can be obtained under a much more general set of geometric constraints and explain how it can be easily controlled by the curvature of the tracer alone. In other words, independently of the local ordering of the particles, induced activity can be imparted by local density gradients around the tracer, which can be tuned and enhanced by manipulating the curvature of the tracer.

Model - We consider a two dimensional model where a single asymmetric tracer is immersed in a bath of N spherical active particles of diameter σ. Each active bath particle has mass m, and undergoes Langevin dynamics at a constant temperature T. Self-propulsion is introduced through a directional force of constant magnitude |Fa| and is directed along a predefined orientation vector [formula] which passes through the origin of each particle and connects its poles. The equations of motion of an individual particle are given by the coupled Langevin equations

[formula]

where γ is the translational friction and V the interparticle potential acting on the particle The translational and rotational diffusion constants are given by D and Dr, respectively. The typical solvent induced Gaussian white noise terms for both the translational and rotational motion are characterized by 〈ξi(t)〉  =  0 and 〈ξi(t)  ·  ξj(t')〉  =  δijδ(t - t') and 〈ξr(t)〉  =  0 and 〈ξr(t)  ·  ξr(t')〉  =  δ(t - t'), respectively. The translational diffusion constant D is related to the temperature T via the Stokes-Einstein relation D = kBT / γ. In the low Reynolds number regime, the rotational and translation diffusion coefficients for a sphere satisfy the relation Dr = (3D) / σ2.

Each tracer is modeled as a bent rod characterized by its arc length [formula] and radius of curvature R (Fig. [\ref=traj](b) and Fig. [\ref=msd](c)). For practical purposes, the rods are discretized into NT = 21 equidistant and overlapping spherical particles of diameter σT = 2.5σ. A suitably large number of spheres were chosen to accurately reproduce the shape of the particle and to make the surface sufficiently smooth. The tracer itself undergoes over-damped Langevin dynamics at a constant temperature T and the equations of motions are the rigid body analogs to Eqs. (1) and (2) where |Fa| = 0 since the tracer itself is non-active.

All interactions between the particles in the systems are purely repulsive and are given by the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen (WCA) potential

[formula]

with a range of action extending up to rij = 21 / 6σ. Here rij is the center to center distance between any two particles i and j, σij = (σi  +  σj) / 2 where i = 1,2 corresponding to an active particle or a tracer particle, respectively, and ε = 10kBT is the interaction energy. Using the numerical package LAMMPS  [\cite=plimpton1995], all simulations were carried out in a periodic box of dimension L = 200 with T = m = σ  =  τ = 1 and γ = 10τ- 1(here τ is the dimensionless time). Each simulation was run for a minimum of [formula] time steps. The drag coefficient γ was chosen to be sufficiently large such that the motion of the particles is effectively overdamped. Several of the simulations were repeated with larger values of γ (e.g. γ = 50,100), which produced no detectable differences in our results. All quantities in this investigation are given in reduced Lennard-Jones units.

Results - As a way of illustrating our main result we show in Fig. 1(a) typical trajectories (particle traces) for tracers having different radii of curvature R at constant arc length [formula] immersed in an active suspension of volume fraction Φ = 0.005 and propelling force |Fa| = 100. A sufficiently large propelling force was chosen to illustrate the curvature induced activation of a tracer. In addition, a typical snapshot from a simulation is given in Fig. [\ref=traj](b), which details the different reference frames used in the subsequent analysis. The typical mean square displacement (MSD) of the center of mass [formula] for various tracers in the laboratory frame is shown in Fig. [\ref=msd](a). All tracers undergo ballistic behavior at short times, and eventually crossover to a diffusive regime at longer times. As the curvature of the tracer increases, the super-diffusive regime persists for longer times prolonging the eventual crossover to the purely diffusive regime. In the body-centered frame, the mean displacement of the tracer along its main axis of symmetry [formula] is given in Fig. [\ref=msd](b). For a straight tracer (i.e. R =   ∞  ), there is no net displacement along the main axis of the tracer, which is obvious from symmetry considerations. However, as soon as the symmetry of the tracer is broken by introducing any amount of curvature, the tracer undergoes net directed motion in the positive [formula] direction leading to a nonzero mean displacement in the body-centered frame. As the tracer becomes increasingly curved (Fig. [\ref=msd](b)), this effective propelling force becomes larger.

The directed motion of the tracer can be understood by looking at the time averaged local density of active particles in the system (Fig. [\ref=denmap]). The average local density is homogeneous across the system, except along the surface of the tracer, where it shows a significant increase. Specifically, the density is larger on the concave side of the tracer when compared to its convex side, and this difference becomes even larger for tracers with higher degrees of curvature. As demonstrated in reference [\cite=fily2014], the positive curvature of a surface can act as a restoring force against random thermal rotations, and drives active particles towards a stable orientation where the propelling axis becomes parallel to the surface normal. This stabilizing effect greatly increases the time required for a particle to escape from the side of the surface with positive curvature. The side of the tracer with negative curvature behaves in the opposite way and destabilizes the axial angle of the particle from the surface normal upon any amount of thermal rotations, which results in a significantly shorter escape time. The combination of these two mechanisms produces the measured density gradient across the tracer that results in its net directed motion.

Due to the symmetry of the system, the average tangential force as well as the average torque will be equal to zero, and indeed we find that the mean squared angular displacement of the tracer 〈Ω2〉 is diffusive for almost all observed times (i.e. 〈Ω2〉  =  DΩt where DΩ is the rotational diffusion constant of the tracer). We find that the rotational diffusion constant DΩ increases with the strength of the active force as well as with the curvature of the tracer for large self-propelling forces (Fig. [\ref=angdiff]). We however defer a full characterization of the rotational dynamics to a later publication, as it is a highly non-trivial problem that truly deserves its own in-depth analysis. The remainder of this work focuses on developing a scaling theory for the curvature induced activation of the tracer.

Discussion - The directed motion of the curved tracer emerges when the persistent length of an active particle becomes much larger than the dimension of the tracer. In this regime, a simple way of estimating the net force exerted on the tracer can be obtained by considering that a bath particle can either be on the surface of the tracer pushing with a force proportional to |Fa| or diffusing across the system and applying no force. As previously mentioned, the amount of time an active particle spends on the surface of the tracer is highly dependent on the side it is located and characterized by a residence time τn or τp for the side of the tracer with negative or positive curvature, respectively. Given these quantities and the average time an active particle spends in the bath between collision with the tracer, which we denote by τ0, the net average force exerted by an ideal gas of N active particles along the [formula] axis of the tracer can be estimated as 〈FA〉  =  N(〈Fp〉  -  〈Fn〉), where 〈Fp〉 and 〈Fn〉 are the average forces exerted on the positive and negative sides of the tracer. In the low density and small tracer limit (i.e. τ0  ≫  τn and τ0  ≫  τp),

where 〈F〉≃|Fa|〈 cos (φ)〉 is the average force an active particle exerts along the [formula] axis of the tracer. For simplicity, we assume that the particle axis is predominantly parallel to the surface normal at that point [\cite=fily2014].

Given the geometry of the system and assuming that an active particle can diffuse anywhere on the surface of the tracer with equal probability (where the angular range spans
