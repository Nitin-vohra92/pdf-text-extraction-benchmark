A note on the Gunningham's formula

Let X be a surface of general type with a smooth canonical divisor D. The complex curve D has genus h = K2X + 1 and the normal bundle N to D is a theta characteristic on D (i.e. N2 = KD) with [formula] (mod 2). The pair (D,N) is called a spin curve of genus h with parity p. The Gromov-Witten invariants of X are the same as the local GW invariants of the spin curve (D,N) that depend only on (h,p). In particular, for d > 0 the dimension zero local GW invariant of the spin curve (D,N) is given by the formula

[formula]

where the sum is over all degree d etale covers f (see [\cite=LP1], [\cite=KL], [\cite=MP]). One can calculate these local invariants by extending the (weighted) signed sum to certain ramified covers, which are the spin Hurwitz numbers.

A partition [formula] is odd if all parts in α are odd. We set

[formula]

Fix k points [formula] in D and consider degree d holomorphic maps f:C  →  D from possibly disconnected curves C of Euler characteristic χ(C) that are ramified only over the fixed points yi with ramification profile [formula]. By the Riemann-Hurwitz formula, the (ramified) covers f satisfy

[formula]

where χ(D) = 2 - 2h and [formula] is the length of the partition αi. By the Hurwitz formula, the twisted line bundle

[formula]

is a theta characteristic on C where f- 1(yi) = {xij} and f has multiplicity αij at xij. We define the parity p(f) of a map f as

[formula]

Given [formula], the spin Hurwitz number of genus h and parity p is defined as a (weighted) sum of covers f satisfying ([\ref=RH]) with sign determined by parity p(f):

[formula]

where +   or -   denotes the parity of the spin curve (D,N). If k = 0 (or unramified) then this is the etale spin Hurwitz number that equals to the local invariant ([\ref=dim=0GW]). We will call χ(C) in ([\ref=RH]) the domain Euler characteristic for the spin Hurwitz number ([\ref=def-spinHurwitz]).

Eskin, Okounkov and Pandharipande [\cite=EOP] first studied the spin Hurwitz numbers for genus h = 1 with trivial theta characteristic, i.e. (h,p) = (1, - ). They related the parity of maps with combinatorics of the Sergeev group [formula]. A partition [formula] of d is strict if [formula]. Let SP(d) denote the set of strict partitions of d and set

[formula]

The irreducible spin [formula]-supermodules [formula] are indexed by strict partitions λ∈SP(d) and the conjugacy class corresponding to an odd partition αi∈OP(n) acts in [formula] as multiplication by a constant, which is the central character [formula] (see Section 1).

[formula]

where χ(C) is the domain Euler characteristic.

Recently, Gunningham [\cite=G] constructed a fully extended (spin) topological quantum field theory (TQFT). His extended TQFT gives a formula for all spin Hurwitz numbers. For each strict partition λ∈SP(d), let [formula] be as above and set

[formula]

[formula]

where χ(D) = 2 - 2h and χ(C) is the domain Euler characteristic.

Independently, Parker and the author [\cite=LP2] adapted the degeneration method of the GW theory to obtain a gluing theorem for spin Hurwitz numbers. For a partition [formula], let γ(k) be the number of parts of size k in γ and set

[formula]

Let [formula]. We have

[formula]

where h = h1 + h2 and [formula] (mod 2).

Our main goal is to reprove the Gunningham's formula ([\ref=G]). To that end, we need to calculate the (h,p) = (0, + ) spin Hurwitz numbers.

Section 1 gives a brief review of the representation theory of the Sergeev group [formula] and a key fact (Lemma [\ref=key]) about the central characters of [formula].

Section 2 follows the approach of [\cite=EOP] to show:

[formula]

In Section 3, we use the gluing theorem with ([\ref=EOP]) and ([\ref=h=0]) to prove the Gunningham's formula. We also observe that the Gunningham's formula gives the gluing theorem (see Remark [\ref=GGluing]).

The spin Hurwitz numbers are not defined for (h,p) = (0, - ) since the only theta characteristic on [formula] is O( - 1). In Section 4, we first extend the gluing theorem to include the case (h,p) = (0, - ) and then describe a TQFT formalism naturally induced from the (extended) gluing theorem.

Representations of the Sergeev group

This section reviews the representation theory of the Sergeev group relevant to our discussion. We generally follow the notation and terminology of [\cite=EOP]. For proofs and more details, we refer to [\cite=J1], [\cite=J2], [\cite=Sg], Chapter 3 of [\cite=CW] and references therein.

Sergeev group

The Sergeev group [formula] is the semidirect product

[formula]

where [formula] is the Clifford group generated by [formula] and a central element ε subject to the relations

[formula]

and the symmetric group [formula] on d letters acts on [formula] by permuting the ξi's.

The group [formula] is a double cover of the hyperoctahedral group [formula]. Since [formula], setting ε = 1 gives a short exact sequence of groups The group [formula] embeds in the symmetric group [formula] on the set [formula] via:

[formula]

Notice that [formula] is the centralizer of the involution k  →   - k in [formula].

Conjugacy classes

The symmetric group [formula] embeds in [formula] and [formula]. An element g of [formula] and [formula] is a pure permutation if [formula]. Define a [formula]-grading on [formula] by setting

[formula]

An even (resp. odd) conjugacy class is a conjugacy class of an even (resp. odd) element. Observe that for each conjugacy class C, either [formula] or C = εC. We have:

Let [formula] be the conjugacy class in [formula] of a pure permutation g of cycle type γ∈OP(d). Then, [formula] and [formula] are disjoint even conjugacy classes and

[formula]

where [formula] is the order of the centralizer of g in [formula] given by ([\ref=order-z]).

We can write all conjugacy classes of [formula] as

[formula]

where m = |OP(d)| = |SP(d)| and q = |SP-(d)|.

The denominator [formula] in ([\ref=num-conj]) is the order of the centralizer of g in [formula].

For a partition [formula], we define

[formula]

Spin [formula]-supermodules

For a finite group G, let [formula] denote the set of irreducible complex representations of G. The central element ε acts as multiplication by either + 1 or - 1 on each [formula]. If ε acts on V as multiplication by - 1, then [formula]. Let [formula] be the set of irreducible complex representations of [formula] on which ε acts as multiplication by - 1. We have

[formula]

The grading ([\ref=grading]) makes the group algebra [formula] a semisimple associative superalgebra. A spin [formula]-supermodule is a supermodule over [formula] on which ε acts as multiplication by - 1. The irreducible (or simple) spin [formula]-supermodules are indexed by strict partitions λ∈SP(d). For each λ∈SP(d), its corresponding irreducible spin [formula]-supermodule [formula] can be written as [formula] with respect to the grading ([\ref=grading]) such that [formula]. Moreover,

for λ∈SP+(d), [formula],

for λ∈SP-(d), [formula] and they are not isomorphic.

Central characters

Let [formula] and [formula] be its character. Since [formula] is a character of spin supermodule, ([\ref=all-conj]) implies that [formula] is determined by its values [formula] on even conjugacy classes [formula] and [formula] where γ∈OP(d). For λ,μ∈SP(d), we have

[formula]

where 〈 , 〉 is the inner product on the space of class functions of the finite group [formula].

For each γ∈OP(d), the class sum [formula] has degree zero and lies in the center of the superalgebra [formula], so it acts on [formula] as multiplication by a constant. This constant is the central character [formula] obtained from the formula

[formula]

When λ∈SP-(d), the central character [formula] equals to the central characters [formula] of the irreducible representations [formula] (i = 0,1).

Now, ([\ref=inner-prod1]) and ([\ref=ccf]) give a fact central to our subsequent discussions.

Let [formula] be as in ([\ref=dim]). We have

Center

Let [formula] be conjugacy classes in a finite group G and let [formula] be the number of solutions [formula] of the equation [formula]. Then we have

[formula]

where [formula] are the central characters of [formula] (cf. Theorem 7.2.1 of [\cite=Sr]).

The central element ε acts on the center [formula] of the (ungraded) group algebra [formula] with ±  1 eigenvalues. We denote by

[formula]

the ( - 1)-eigenspace consisting of even degree elements. This space has a basis

[formula]

For notational simplicity, we set [formula]. Since [formula] and [formula] for all α,β∈OP(d), the space Z+0 is a commutative associative algebra with identity [formula].

By (c) and (d) in Section 1.3 and ([\ref=Serre]), we obtain:

If [formula], then the structure constants [formula] are given by the formula

[formula]

Calculation of genus zero spin Hurwitz numbers

This section calculates the genus h = 0 spin Hurwitz numbers following the arguments of [\cite=EOP]. We generally follow the notation and terminology in [\cite=EOP].

Quadratic form

Consider a degree d map

[formula]

ramified only over fixed points [formula] with ramification profile αi∈OP(d) at yi satisfying ([\ref=RH]). Let N = O( - 1) and let L = Nf denote the theta characteristic on C defined by ([\ref=TwistedTheta]). For each (connected) component Ci of C where 1  ≤  i  ≤  n, the theta characteristic Li = L|Ci on Ci determines a quadratic form qLi on the group J2(Ci) of elements of order two in the Jacobian of Ci by

[formula]

such that

[formula]

For [formula] in [formula], let [formula]. We have

[formula]

Canonical lift

Each ρ∈J2(C) defines an unramified double cover Cρ  →  C, which is composed with f to give a degree 2d cover

[formula]

Let σ be the fixed point free involution in the symmetric group [formula] given by the covering transformation permuting the sheets of Cρ  →  C. By our construction, the monodromy group of fρ lies in the centralizer of the involution σ in [formula], which is the group [formula] (see Section 1.1). The monodromy of fρ thus defines a homomorphism

[formula]

where [formula].

One can choose a small loop δi encircling only the branch point yi such that

[formula],

Mfρ(δi) is conjugate to a pure permutation gi of cycle type αi∈OP(d) in [formula].

Then by (a) in Section 1.2,

[formula]

where Cαi is the conjugacy class of the pure permutation gi in the Sergeev group [formula]. The monodromy of fρ is said to have a canonical lift to [formula] if there exists a homomorphism [formula] such that fρ(δi)∈Cαi for all i and the diagram commute:

[formula]

The following fact is a special case of Theorem 1 of [\cite=EOP] -- the case of [formula].

qL(ρ) = 0 if and only if the monodromy of fρ has a canonical lift to [formula].

Weighted count

Let G be [formula] or [formula], and let Cαi denote the conjugacy class of a pure permutation in G with cycle type αi∈OP(d). We set

[formula]

and denote by HG(M) the set of homomorphisms [formula] sending the conjugacy class of the loop δi into the conjugacy class Cαi. Taking into account the action of G by conjugation, we set

[formula]

The groups [formula] and [formula] have natural homomorphisms to [formula] by definition. Given a homomorphism [formula], let HG(M;φ) be the set of homomorphisms ψ∈HG(M) with commutative diagram

[formula]

where [formula] is the natural homomorphism. The weighted count of such homomorphisms is

[formula]

By ([\ref=Serre]) and definition, hG(M;φ) and hG(M) satisfy

[formula]

There is a bijection between ramified covers [formula] (as in ([\ref=intro-map])) and orbits of the action of [formula] on [formula] by conjugation. This bijection is given by the monodromy [formula] of the map f. The order of the stabilizer of Mf is |(f)| and hence

[formula]

where Of is the orbit of Mf. This the classical Hurwitz numbers that count ramified covers of [formula] with ramification data specified by M in ([\ref=data]).

Let [formula] and Of be as in Remark [\ref=Hurwitz] and let φ∈Of. If the domain C has n (connected) components [formula], then we have

[formula]

The proof is identical to that of Lemma 3 in [\cite=EOP]. Assigning to each ρ∈J2(C) the monodromy Mfρ given in ([\ref=mono-hom]) defines a bijection between J2(C) and orbits of the action of [formula] on [formula] by conjugation. Let [formula] and Cρi  →  C be the double cover determined by ρi in J2(Ci). Then the stabilizer of Mfρ is generated by [formula] where σi is the involution permuting the sheets of Cρi  →  Ci. So, every orbit of the action of [formula] on [formula] has 2d - n elements and hence

[formula]

This completes the proof of the lemma.

Proof of ([\ref=h=0])

Let [formula] be as in Lemma [\ref=lemma3]. By our choice of the conjugacy classes Cαi in G, the homomorphism [formula] induces an one-to-one function

[formula]

Moreover, qL(ρ) = 0 if and only if the monodromy Mfρ lies in the image of ([\ref=1-1]) by Proposition [\ref=EOP-thm1]. Thus by ([\ref=Arf]) and Lemma [\ref=lemma3], we have

[formula]

Now, it follows that

[formula]

where the second equality follows from ([\ref=Hurwitz]) and ([\ref=step1]), the third from ([\ref=decomp-irr]) and ([\ref=h-cha]), and the last from (c) and (d) in Section 1.3. This completes the proof of ([\ref=h=0]).

A proof of the Gunningham's formula ([\ref=G])

For [formula], we set where χ(D) = 2 - 2h and χ(C) is the domain Euler characteristic.

Using the Einstein summation convention, we raise indices by the formula

[formula]

For notational convenience, we denote multi-indices [formula] by boldface index [formula]. Then the gluing theorem (Theorem [\ref=T:LP2]) can be written as:

[formula]

By the additivity of Euler characteristic, if χ(C), χ(C1) and χ(C2) are the domain Euler characteristics for [formula], [formula] and [formula], then

[formula]

The first formula in ([\ref=gluing]) thus follows from Theorem [\ref=T:LP2] and the definition [formula]. The proof of the second formula is the same.

Now, observe that

[formula]

where the first equality follows from the gluing theorem, the second from ([\ref=h=0]), the last from Lemma [\ref=key]. In this way, the gluing theorem, ([\ref=EOP]) and ([\ref=h=0]) inductively give

[formula]

This completes the proof of ([\ref=G]).

By Lemma [\ref=key], one can easily obtain ([\ref=gluing]) from ([\ref=another-G]). Therefore, the Gunningham's formula ([\ref=G]) implies the gluing theorem (Theorem [\ref=T:LP2]).

A TQFT formalism

This section discusses a TQFT formalism via the gluing theorem. Our approach is analogous to the one in [\cite=BP2]. We refer to [\cite=A] and [\cite=K] for Frobenius algebra and TQFT.

Extended gluing theorem

Recall that spin Hurwitz numbers are not defined for (h,p) = (0, - ) because the only theta characteristic on [formula] is the even theta characteristic O( - 1). In lieu of Lemma [\ref=key] and the formula ([\ref=another-G]), if we define

[formula]

then the gluing theorem ([\ref=gluing]) extends to include the case (h,p) = (0, - ).

Functor

The (extended) gluing theorem naturally induces a functor between tensor categories,

[formula]

Here [formula] denotes the usual tensor category of complex vector spaces. The objects of the category [formula] are finite unions of oriented circles. The morphisms are given by pairs (D,p), where D is an oriented cobordism (modulo diffeomorphism relative to the boundary) between two objects and [formula]. We denote by

[formula]

the connected genus h with parity p cobordism from a disjoint union of r circles to a disjoint union of s circles. The composition of morphisms, obtained by concatenation of cobordisms, respects the [formula]-grading (or parity). The tensor structure on the category [formula] is given by disjoint union.

We define [formula] to be the vector space with basis [formula] labelled by odd partitions α∈OP(d) and let

[formula]

For connected cobordisms Wsr(h,p), we define a linear map

[formula]

where [formula] for [formula]. Taking tensor product, we extend this definition to disconnected cobordisms.

[formula] takes the identity morphism D11(0, + ) to the identity map on F,

[formula]

by Lemma [\ref=L:TQFT] (b) below. [formula] also takes, by the (extended) gluing theorem, the concatenation of cobordisms to the composition of linear maps (cf. Proposition 4.1 of [\cite=BP1]). Therefore, [formula] is a well-defined functor. In particular, one obtain a 2D (two dimensional) TQFT, [formula], by restricting to even cobordisms.

Recall that [formula] denotes the partition (1d)∈SP(d). The fact below follows from the same calculation of Hurwitz numbers because the parity of the maps with domain [formula] is even.

For α,β∈OP(d), we have

[formula]

Frobenius algebra

The even cap D1(0, + ) defines a unit [formula] by [formula] (see Lemma [\ref=L:TQFT] (a)), while the even pant D12(0, + ) defines a multiplication [formula] by

[formula]

The algebra F is thus, by Lemma [\ref=str-cons] and ([\ref=another-G]), isomorphic to the algebra Z+0 in ([\ref=Hspace]) with isomorphism [formula]. The Frobenius algebra structure on F  =  Z+0 is given by the counit

[formula]

Using Lemma [\ref=key] and the structure constants [formula], one can find, by hand, an idempotent basis [formula] ([formula]):

[formula]

The Frobenius algebra F  =  Z+0 is semisimple since [formula] where [formula]'s are 1-dimensional Frobenius algebras with counit [formula]. Observe that since [formula], we have

[formula]

Local GW invariants of spin curve

The semisimplicity, [formula], implies that [formula] is an eigenvector with eigenvalue [formula] for the genus adding operator

[formula]

One can also see, by simple calculation, that [formula] is an eigenvector with eigenvalue [formula] for the involution

[formula]

Now, noting that [formula], [formula] and

[formula]

we can write the dimension zero local invariant ([\ref=dim=0GW]) (or etale spin Hurwitz number) as

[formula]

where χ(D) = 2 - 2h and χ(C) is the domain Euler characteristic.

The proof is same as calculation of the Gromov-Witten invariants Its proof is standard. We note that maps contributing to (a) and (b) have genus zero domain and hence parity of maps are positive.

Let [formula] be a degree d ramified cover ramified only over two points [formula] with ramification profiles α and β. Then it is easy to see that α  =  β, [formula] and each component [formula] of f has one ramification point over yk (k = 1,2) of multiplicity equal to deg (f|Ci). There exists unique such map f with [formula] and p(f) = 0; [formula] has only even theta characteristic. Therefore, [formula] with [formula]. This proves (b). The proof of (a) is similar.

s of (a) and (b) are similar and standard. We will prove (b) only. Let [formula] be a degree d ramified cover ramified only over two points [formula] with ramification profiles α and β. Let [formula] denote the number of components of f. Since each component Ci of f has at least one ramification point over yk (k = 1,2), the Riemann-Hurwitz formula ([\ref=RH]) shows

[formula]

It follows that [formula] and each component [formula] such that the restriction map f|Ci has one ramification point over each yk with ramification index deg (f|Ci). We conclude that (i) α  =  β and (ii) there exists unique such map f with [formula] and p(f) = 0; [formula] has only even theta characteristic. Therefore, H0, +α,β = 0 if α  ≠  β and [formula] with [formula]. This proves (b).

The type (3,3) permutations in the hyperoctahedral group B(3) are:

[formula]

They are all conjugate in B(3).

Let x1,x2,x3 be distinct points in [formula]. Then

[formula]

where δi are homotopy classes of loops around xi. One can define homomorphisms

[formula]

Observe that

The image φ(π1) is a transitive subgroup of S(6) and hence φ gives a connected ramified covering [formula] with ramification index (3) at yki (k = 1,2) over xi.

φ has no canonical lift to C(3) because (123)ξ2ξ1 is conjugate to ε(123) in C(3):
