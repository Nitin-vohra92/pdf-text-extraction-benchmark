A surprising fibration of by great 3-spheres

Introduction

Background and definitions

The Hopf fibrations of S2n + 1 by great circles, S4n + 3 by great 3-spheres, and S15 by great 7-spheres are the prototypical examples of fibrations of spheres by subspheres [\cite=hopf1931abbildungen] [\cite=hopf1935abbildungen].

They have many beautiful properties. They are unique among fibrations of spheres by great subspheres in having parallel fibers [\cite=gromoll1988low] [\cite=wilking2001index]. We show in another paper [\cite=nuchi2014hopf] that they are also characterized among subsphere fibrations by having a symmetry group large enough to take any fiber to any other fiber.

Let F be a fibration of a Riemannian manifold (M,g). We say that F is fiberwise homogeneous if for any two fibers there is an isometry of (M,g) taking fibers to fibers and taking the first given fiber to the second one. See Figure [\ref=Fig:ExampleFWH] for an example.

The main theorem of [\cite=nuchi2014hopf], a companion paper to this one, is that the Hopf fibrations are characterized among fibrations of spheres by subspheres by being fiberwise homogeneous.

In this paper we focus on the unit 7-sphere, embedded in [formula]. Consider the "Clifford Torus" S3  ×  S3 in the 7-sphere, where each factor is the sphere of radius [formula] in its respective [formula] factor. The main result here is that there are fibrations of this Clifford Torus by great 3-spheres which are fiberwise homogeneous but whose fibers are not parallel to one another. Hence they are not restrictions of a Hopf fibration of S7.

In Section [\ref=Sec:Nonstandard], we will carefully construct these nonstandard fibrations, and prove that they are indeed distinct from the Hopf fibrations and that they are fiberwise homogeneous. In Section [\ref=Sec:Geometry], we will elaborate on the geometry of these nonstandard fibrations, and explain how they differ from the Hopf fibrations.

The Nonstandard fibrations of

John Petro's moduli space for fibrations of

By "great 3-sphere," we mean a subset of S3  ×  S3 which, when included in S7 as the Clifford Torus, is a great 3-sphere. Equivalently, a great 3-sphere in S3  ×  S3 is the graph of an isometry from one 3-sphere factor to the other.

We identify S3 with the unit sphere in the space of quaternions. This allows us to identify SO(4) with [formula], with the pair of unit quaternions (p,q) acting on x∈S3 via quaternionic multiplication:

[formula]

and the [formula] action taking (p,q) to ( - p, - q). Then a typical great 3-sphere in S3  ×  S3 can be written as the graph of an orientation-preserving isometry of S3, x  ↦  pxq- 1:

[formula]

or that followed by an orientation-reversing isometry of the second factor.

By the work of John Petro [\cite=petro1987great], inspired by earlier work of Herman Gluck and Frank Warner [\cite=gluck1983great], the fibrations of S3  ×  S3 by great 3-spheres are in one-to-one correspondence with four copies of the space of distance-decreasing maps of S3 to S3.

One of those copies consists of fibrations of S3  ×  S3 by great 3-spheres Σ3 of the form

[formula]

where p ranges across S3 and indexes each fiber in the fibration, and f is a fixed distance-decreasing map of S3 to S3 which determines the fibration.

The other fibrations of S3  ×  S3 by great 3-spheres have similar forms. The key fact which Petro uses to prove this correspondence is that two great 3-spheres

[formula]

are disjoint precisely when d(p1,p2)  ≠  d(q1,q2). In a fibration, any two fibers are disjoint, and so the inequality becomes either uniformly >   for any two fibers, or uniformly <   for any two fibers. In the former case we get fibers of the form

[formula]

with f a distance-decreasing function, and we get something similar in the case where the inequality is replaced by <  .

The Hopf fibration

If we think of the unit 7-sphere as sitting in quaternionic 2-space, then the fibers of the Hopf fibration are the intersections of that 7-sphere with the various quaternionic lines through the origin. To be more precise, quaternionic 2-space has the structure of a "vector space" with quaternionic scalars acting on the right and matrices acting on the left. We write the quaternionic line spanned by [formula] as [formula].

If we restrict the Hopf fibration to S3  ×  S3, then we take only the quaternionic lines which intersect this set; that restricts our pairs (u,v) to those where [formula]. We normalize so that [formula]. Further, we may choose u = 1 by right-multiplying by an appropriate scalar. Finally, instead of multiplying the vector (u,v) by any [formula], we restrict ourselves to x∈S3. Thus, the Hopf fibers in S3  ×  S3 are of the form

[formula]

with v a unit quaternion. To relate this to our discussion of John Petro's moduli space, the Hopf fibration corresponds to the fibration where we take our distance decreasing function to be [formula]. We may easily check that if we apply an isometry of S3  ×  S3 to the Hopf fibrations, left- and right-multiplying on either S3 factor, the distance-decreasing functions that arise in John Petro's moduli space are precisely the constant functions. In other words,

A fibration with fibers

[formula]

is Hopf if and only if f is a constant function.

We demonstrate that the Hopf fibration is indeed fiberwise homogeneous. For each q∈S3, let q act isometrically on S3  ×  S3 via q  ·  (x,y)  =  (x,q y). Then it's clear that q  ·  Hv  =  Hqv, so that S3 acts transitively on the Hopf fibers.

We remark that this is not the largest group acting on the Hopf fibration; all we need is that it's large enough to act transitively taking fibers to fibers.

The new nonstandard examples

We will find a distance-decreasing map of S3 to S3 which is nonconstant and is pointwise homogeneous:

A function f:S3  →  S3 is pointwise homogeneous if for all u,v∈S3 there are isometries T1,T2∈SO(4) such that [formula] and T1(u)  =  v.

Finding such a map leads immediately to a fiberwise homogeneous fibration:

Let f:S3  →  S3 be distance-decreasing, and consider the fibration whose fibers are

[formula]

The fibration is fiberwise homogeneous if and only if f is pointwise homogeneous.

Let f be pointwise homogeneous, and let u,v∈S3. The isometries T1,T2 in SO(4) which commute with f (and for which T1(u) = v) can be written

[formula]

We mix and match T1 and T2: a straightforward computation shows that the isometry of S3  ×  S3 which takes (x,y) to (q1 x q- 12,p1 y p- 12) takes the fiber Σu to Σv, and preserves fibers.

Conversely, let the fibration be fiberwise homogeneous. The mixing and matching we performed in the one direction works just the same in reverse.

The key insight of this paper is that the classical Hopf fibration πH:S3  →  S2 can be tweaked to give a distance-decreasing map from S3 to S3 which is pointwise homogeneous, and which then, by the above proposition and the work of John Petro, yields a fiberwise homogeneous fibration of S3  ×  S3 by great 3-spheres which is not part of a Hopf fibration of the 7-sphere.

Let S2 be the unit sphere in the space of purely imaginary quaternions. Then πH can be written explicitly as

[formula]

The great circle fibers are the left cosets pS1 of the circle subgroup

[formula]

This map is distance-doubling in directions orthogonal to the fibers. For our purposes, we need a distance-decreasing map, so we shrink the image 2-sphere. Let f:S3  →  S2 be defined by

[formula]

where α is a fixed small angle. In particular, if α  =  π / 6, then the image 2-sphere has radius 1 / 2. In that case fα is distance-preserving in directions orthogonal to the Hopf fibers when we measure distances in the intrinsic metric on S2, but is strictly distance-decreasing when distances in the 2-sphere are measured via shortcuts in S3. Similarly if α is less than π / 6 then fα is likewise distance-decreasing.

We remark that not only do we have fα(p)  =  fα(p eit) for all α,p,t, we also have fα(q p)  =  q fα(p) q- 1 for all p,q. In other words, fα is pointwise homogeneous (left-multiplication by q is conjugate to the isometry of conjugation by q).

We take as our nonstandard fiberwise homogeneous fibration of S3  ×  S3 the collection of fibers

[formula]

for each p∈S3, and for 0  ≤  α  ≤  π / 6.

The fibers Σ3p form a fiberwise homogeneous fibration of S3  ×  S3, distinct from any Hopf fibration, as long as 0  <  α  ≤  π / 6.

We have already seen that these great 3-spheres form a fibration, from Petro's moduli space and the observation that fα is distance-decreasing. This fibration is not a Hopf fibration because fα is nonconstant for α∈(0,π / 6]. It remains to show that the fibration is fiberwise homogeneous.

Let q∈S3. We let S3 act isometrically on S3  ×  S3 via

[formula]

Then we claim that q  ·  Σ3p  =  Σ3qp. We compute:

[formula]

In the third equality we merely substitute y  =  x q- 1, and in the fourth equality we use the pointwise homogeneity of fα which we remarked upon earlier. This concludes the proof that our fibration is fiberwise homogeneous.

Geometry of the nonstandard fibration

In each of the classical Hopf fibrations, the fibers are parallel to one another. This allows us to get a feel for the geometry of the fibrations by putting a metric on the base space of the fibrations which makes their projections into Riemannian submersions. Likewise for the restriction of the Hopf fibration of S7 by 3-spheres to the Clifford torus: the fibers are parallel to one another, and the base is diffeomorphic to S3, and the submersion metric is a round metric.

But in our new nonstandard example, the fibers are not parallel to one another, so we cannot put a submersion metric on the base. We have to get a feel for the geometry by other means. Refer again to Figure [\ref=Fig:ExampleFWH] for an example to keep in mind, of a fiberwise homogeneous fibration with nonparallel fibers.

Here is what we do: we fix our attention on one fiber Σ, and we aim for a description of how that fiber sits in relation to nearby fibers. To be more specific, for each nearby fiber Σ', we determine the subset of Σ which lies closest to Σ'. If our fibration were Riemannian, there would be no distinguished subset of Σ, but because the fibration does not have parallel fibers, as our attention flits over various nearby Σ', we will notice various "hot" subsets of Σ closest to Σ' and various "cold" subsets of Σ which are furthest from Σ'. See Figure [\ref=Fig:HotAndCold].

Now fix a value of α in (0,π / 6], and consider our nonstandard fibration with fibers

[formula]

for each p∈S3, and with fα(p) = p eiα p- 1. We fix our attention on the fiber

[formula]

and determine how the nearby fibers are positioned relative to it. By "nearby fibers," we mean those fibers Σp for which p is on the boundary of an ε-neighborhood of 1∈S3.

First we observe that if we move away from Σ1 in the i-direction, we find that the fibers Σeiε and Σe- iε are parallel to Σ1. That's because

[formula]

the function fα is constant along the Hopf fibers (left cosets p eiθ).

Thus moving from fiber to fiber in the i-direction, our nonstandard fibration looks just like a Hopf fibration. The new interesting geometry lies in the orthogonal directions, as we let p vary along the circle p(θ)  =  ejθε  =  e(j cos θ + k sin θ)ε. Here we let jθ denote a point on the great circle through j and k. We will see momentarily that for those values of p, the fiber Σ1 has a great circle's worth of closest points to Σp(θ) and a great circle's worth of furthest points from Σp(θ). Refer again to Figure [\ref=Fig:HotAndCold].

We answer the question "what is this nonstandard fibration's geometry like?" by describing how these great circles vary with θ. Because our fibration is fiberwise homogeneous, the geometry near Σ1 is the same as the geometry near any other fiber.

Our task is now to determine the "hot" and "cold" sets in Σ1 relative to the fibers Σp(θ); i.e. the subsets of Σ1 closest to and furthest from those nearby fibers.

To compute the hot and cold sets in Σ1 relative to Σp(θ), we take advantage of the fact that they will be preserved by isometries of the ambient space, and apply an isometry of S3  ×  S3 (depending on θ) which takes Σ1 to the diagonal, and takes Σp(θ) to a conveniently placed great 3-sphere. The following lemma demonstrates what it means to be a "conveniently placed great 3-sphere."

Let [formula] and Σ be the great 3-spheres

[formula]

with 0  <  φ  <  θ  <  π. Then the great circle

[formula]

is the set of points in [formula] closest to Σ (the "hot" set), and the great circle

[formula]

is the set of points in [formula] furthest from Σ (the "cold" set).

The "hot" set H and "cold" set C are the subsets of [formula] given by

[formula]

We compute, for [formula] (see the discussion afterwards for explanation):

[formula]

This requires explanation. We use d to denote both distance in S3  ×  S3 and in S3, relying on context to distinguish between the two. The first equality is by the definition of the product metric. To minimize this quantity, we have to pick y to minimize the sum of squares of distances between a fixed point z and two points that vary with y, see Figure [\ref=Fig:Infimums], left picture. The second equality follows because [formula] is an isometry of S3. Now we have the easier task of minimizing the sum of squares of distances between two fixed points and a single point y that varies, see Figure [\ref=Fig:Infimums], right picture. In the third equality, we minimize the given quantity by choosing [formula], the midpoint of z and e- iθ z eiφ.

To find H, we find the infimum of d(z,e- iθ z eiφ), and see that the values of z which minimize it are precisely those on the great circle joining 1 and i. Similarly, to find C, we find the supremum of d(z,e- iθ z eiφ), and see that the values of z which maximize it are precisely those on the great circle joining j and k.

This takes a small amount of computation to see. We observe that

[formula]

As z varies, the point z- 1 eiθ z remains on a sphere centered at 1. But eiθ and eiφ lie on half a great circle with endpoints ±  1, so the values of z which minimize the expression above are precisely those which leave eiθ where it is instead of moving it further away. Those values of z are exactly the great circle through 1 and i. A similar argument shows that for z on the great circle through j and k, the expression z- 1 eiθ z is equal to e- iθ and hence is maximally far from eiφ. See Figure [\ref=Fig:Minimum].

The above lemma also holds if we replace (i,j,k), wherever we see them, with any positive orthonormal basis for the space of purely imaginary quaternions. The proof works exactly the same way. Thus a "conveniently placed 3-sphere" relative to the diagonal is one of the form

[formula]

with q any purely imaginary unit quaternion.

Recall that we have defined

[formula]

with jθ  =  j cos θ  +  k sin θ. We would like to move Σ1 to the diagonal [formula], and also move Σp(θ) to a conveniently placed great 3-sphere. To that end, we let T∈SO(4)  ×  SO(4) be the isometry of S3  ×  S3 defined by

[formula]

Then we compute

[formula]

We let q'  =  ejθε e- iα e- jθε eiα. We find (omitting the tedious computation) that

[formula]

If we let ε  →  0, and take a first-order approximation, then we conclude that

[formula]

Therefore Σ'p(θ) is not yet conveniently positioned relative to [formula], because

[formula]

Therefore we let T'∈SO(4)  ×  SO(4) act on S3  ×  S3 via

[formula]

This choice is exactly what we need to move Σ'p(θ) to a convenient position. We find that

[formula]

Computing [formula], we find (omitting, again, the tedious computation) that

[formula]

Letting ε  →  0, and taking a first-order approximation, we see that

[formula]

Therefore Σ''p(θ) is conveniently placed relative to [formula] (see Corollary [\ref=Cor:Convenient]), at least in the limit as ε  →  0.

It follows that the "hot" circle in [formula] relative to Σ''p(θ) is the great circle passing through 1 and jθ, and the "cold" circle is the orthogonal great circle passing through i and jθ  +  π / 2, at least as ε  →  0. All that remains is to move [formula] back to Σ1 and see where that takes these hot and cold circles.

The set of points in Σ1 which lies closest to Σp(θ) is the great circle which, when projected to the first factor of S3  ×  S3, passes through [formula] and [formula].

The set of points in Σ1 lying furthest from Σp(θ) is the great circle which, when projected to the first factor, passes through [formula] and [formula].

We simply apply Corollary [\ref=Cor:Convenient] to [formula] and Σ''p(θ), and follow what happens to the hot and cold circles in [formula] as we undo the transformations T' and T.

As a final remark, we observe that the hot circles in Σ1 always pass through the antipodal points [formula] independently of θ. Likewise the cold circles always pass through [formula] independently of θ. As we vary θ, we watch the hot and cold circles spin around their fixed points to trace out 2-spheres. The hot and cold circles spin round one another like a pair of linked eggbeater blades. See Figure [\ref=Fig:eggbeater]. In the center we have Σ1, with the circle of fibers Σeε(j cos θ + k sin θ) arrayed around it. Inside Σ1, the linked red and blue great circles are the hot and cold circles.
