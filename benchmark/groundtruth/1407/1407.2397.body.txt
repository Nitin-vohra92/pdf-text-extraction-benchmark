Elementary methods for Incidence problems in finite fields

Introduction

Let [formula] be a field with characteristic strictly greater than 2. In this note, it is established that for a point set [formula] and a family S of spheres in [formula], the number of incidences between the points and spheres, which is denoted by I(P,S): = |{(p,S)∈P   ×   S:p∈S}|, satisfies the bound

[formula]

Many results on incidence problems in finite fields have appeared in recent years; see for example [\cite=BKT] [\cite=HR] [\cite=Jones] [\cite=vinh]. For relatively large sets of points and surfaces in [formula], Fourier analysis and spectral graph theory have been the main tools to deal with these problems. For example, Vinh [\cite=vinh] used the spectral method to prove that, for sets P and L of points and lines respectively in [formula],

[formula]

The result was extended to incidences between points and hyperplanes in [formula], and can also be proven using discrete Fourier analysis.

In [\cite=Ci], the first author found an elementary method to prove some results on combinatorial problems in finite fields, including an alternative proof of [\eqref=vinhST]. Here we follow that elementary approach to give an estimate on incidences of points and spheres in [formula] and illustrate it with some applications to the pinned distance problem, as well proving a version of Beck's Theorem for circles in [formula].

In particular, the version of Beck's Theorem for points and circles is tight up to multiplicative constants. In the forthcoming Theorem [\ref=beckcirc], it is established that any set [formula] such that |P|  ≥  5q determines a positive proportion of all circles. On the other hand, if one takes a set P of q points lying on a single line in the plane, then P does not determine any circles. Similarly, if P consists of, say, q + 1 points on the same circle, then P determines only 1 circle. These degenerate examples are in a sense 1-dimensional, and illustrate the tightness of Theorem [\ref=beckcirc].

Before saying any more about spheres in finite fields, it is necessary to define what is meant by such an object. We follow the notion of distance introduced in [\cite=IR]; given a pair of points [formula] and [formula] in [formula], the distance between x and y is given by

[formula]

As one might expect, a sphere in [formula] is a set of points which are the same distance λ from a given central point [formula]. That is, a sphere is the set of points [formula] which satisfy an equation of the form

[formula]

These spheres have many natural properties which are analogous with spheres in [formula]. For example, given two circles in [formula], it is easy to check that the circles intersect in at most two points.

Work of Phoung, Thang and Vinh

Shortly after an earlier draft of this paper was made available online, we became aware of its overlap with a forthcoming paper of Phoung, Thang and Vinh [\cite=PTV]. The authors in [\cite=PTV] give an independent proof of Theorem [\ref=main] via graph theoretic methods similar to those used in [\cite=vinh]. Further applications of the incidence result are also given in [\cite=PTV].

Incidences between spheres and points

Given finite sets A,B in a finite group (G, + ) we use the notation We recall the following elementary and well known identities:

[formula]

The quantity in [\eqref=2] is called the additive energy of A and B.

Define

[formula]

Then, for all [formula],

[formula]

This can be calculated directly. Indeed, the quantity rA - A(x) is the number of solutions

[formula]

to the system of equations

[formula]

The bi variables can be eliminated, and this system of equations reduces to

[formula]

If x  ≠  0 then there is some 1  ≤  i  ≤  d such that xi  ≠  0. Otherwise xd + 1 = 0 and x = 0 is the only choice which admits solutions to [\eqref=hyperplane]. Without loss of generality, we may take i = 1. If we fix [formula], then since the characteristic of the field is not equal to 2, we have 2x1  ≠  0 and the value of a1 is uniquely determined. This gives rA - A(x)  ≤  qd - 1.

If x = 0, then trivially rA - A(0) = |A| = qd.

Let A be as defined in [\eqref=Adefn], and let [formula] be arbitrary. Then

[formula]

for some [formula] such that |θ| < 1.

Note that

[formula]

By Cauchy-Schwarz:

[formula]

Using [\eqref=1], [\eqref=2] and the fact that |A| = qd we have

[formula]

Thus, |E| < (|B||C|)1 / 2qd / 2, which completes the proof.

Let [formula] and let S be a family of spheres in [formula]. Then

[formula]

We denote by [formula] the sphere

[formula]

Define

[formula]

and

[formula]

Note that |B| = |P| and |C| = |S|.

Now, note that

[formula]

An application of Lemma [\ref=l2] completes the proof.

Applications of the incidence bound

Pinned distances

Let P be a set of points in [formula], and [formula]. Following the notation of Chapman et. al. [\cite=Ch], let [formula] denote the set of distances between the point y and the set P; that is

[formula]

It was established in ([\cite=Ch], Theorem 2.3) that a sufficiently large set of points determines many pinned distances, for many different pins. Here, we use Theorem [\ref=main] to give an alternative proof.

Let P be a subset of [formula] such that [formula] for some 0 < ε < 1. Then,

[formula]

Fix a point p∈P, and construct a family of spheres Sp by minimally covering P by concentric spheres around p. Note that [formula], and that I(P,Sp) = |P|. Repeating this process for each point in P, we generate a family of spheres S defined by the disjoint union

[formula]

Observe that [formula]. On the other hand, Theorem [\ref=main] implies that

[formula]

If [formula] the last inequality would imply that [formula].

Let P be a subset of [formula] such that [formula] for some 0 < α < 1. Then, for at least (1 - α)|P| points p∈P.

Corollary [\ref=pinned] implies that

[formula]

On the other hand let

[formula]

and suppose that |P'| < (1 - α)|P|. Then we would have

[formula]

A version of Beck's Theorem for circles

A result which is closely related to the Szemerédi-Trotter Theorem and incidence geometry is Beck's Theorem [\cite=Beck]. This result states that a set of N points in [formula] determines Ω(N2) distinct lines by connecting pairs of points, provided that the set of points does not contain a single line which supports cN points, where c is a small but fixed constant. We say that that P determines a line l if there exist two points p1 and p2 belonging to P which both lie on the line l. In finite fields, an analogue of Beck's Theorem was proven by Alon [\cite=Alon], in the form of the following theorem:

Let ε > 0 and let P be a set of points in the projective plane [formula] such that |P| > (1 + ε)(q + 1). Then P determines at least

[formula]

distinct straight lines.

Iosevich, Rudnev and Zhai [\cite=IRZ] used Fourier analytic techniques to establish a similar result. So, a sufficiently large set of points in the plane determines a positive proportion of all possible lines. The aim here is to establish an analogue of Theorem [\ref=beck], with the role of lines replaced by circles. Since there are q2 choices for the location of a circle's centre, and q choices for the radius, we want to generate Ω(q3) circles. We first need an obvious definition of what it means for a circle to be generated by a set of points.

Given three non-collinear points in [formula], there exists a unique circle which passes through each of the three points. The same is true of three points in [formula]:

Let (x1,y1), (x2,y2) and (x3,y3) be three distinct non-collinear points in [formula]. Then there exists a unique circle supporting the three points.

We'll show that there exists a unique triple of elements [formula] such that the system of equations

[formula]

can be realised. Note that we cannot have x1 = x2 = x3, since this would contradict the hypothesis that the three points are non-collinear. Therefore, it is assumed without loss of generality that x1  ≠  x2 and x1  ≠  x3.

Subtracting the first equation in [\eqref=system2] from the second and third yields the following system of linear equations:

[formula]

It cannot be the case that both y2 = y1 and y3 = y1 (otherwise the three points would be collinear), and so at least one of the b coefficients is non-zero. Therefore, this is a system of two linear equations with two variables (a and b). This system has a unique solution (a,b), unless it is degenerate. This solution can then be plugged into [\eqref=system2] to give a unique solution to the system as required. It remains to show that [\eqref=system3] is non-degenerate.

Suppose for a contradiction that [\eqref=system3] is degenerate. Then there exists [formula] such that

[formula]

Since it is known that at least one of y2 - y1 and y3 - y1 is non-zero, and λ is non-zero, it must be the case that both y2 - y1  ≠  0 and y3 - y1  ≠  0. Therefore,

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

and clearly

[formula]

This implies that (x1,y1),(x2,y2) and (x3,y3) are supported on a line with equation

[formula]

where [formula]. This is a contradiction, and the proof is complete.

We say that a circle C is determined by P if there exist three points from P which determine the circle C. We are now ready to state our version of Beck's Theorem for circles:

Let [formula] such that |P|  ≥  5q. Then P determines at least [formula] distinct circles.

Note that in the statement of Theorems [\ref=beck] and [\ref=beckcirc], the conclusion is that we determine a positive proportion of all possible lines and circles respectively. If one asks how many points are needed to generate all lines (respectively circles), then the problem becomes rather different, since one can take a point set [formula] where l is a line (respectively [formula] where C is a circle), and the line l (respectively the circle C) is not determined by the point set P. So, we cannot hope to show that a set of o(q2) points determine all possible lines or circles.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=beckcirc]

At the outset, identify a subset P'  ⊂  P such that |P'| = 5q. The aim is to show that P', and hence also P, determines many circles.

Let S be the set of all circles which contain less than or equal to 3 points from P'. We will show that

[formula]

and then since there are q3 circles, it must be the case that there are at least [formula] circles which contain at least 3 points from P'. These 4q3 / 9 circles are therefore spanned by P.

It remains to prove [\eqref=aim], and to do this we will make use of the lower bound on I(P',S) from Theorem [\ref=main]. We have

[formula]

a rearrangement of which gives

[formula]

as required.

Arguments similar to the proof above can be found in [\cite=LS]. Note that, using a lower bound on the number of incidences between sets of points and lines in [formula] which follows from the proof of the main result in [\cite=vinh], it is straightforward to adapt the proof of Theorem [\ref=beckcirc] with lines in the place of circles in order to prove a version of Theorem [\ref=beck].
