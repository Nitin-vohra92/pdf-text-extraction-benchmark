Introduction

Nonlinearity and complexity are common features of a large number of systems studied in modern science [\cite=compl1]-[\cite=roehner2007driving]. In many cases, researchers have detected the existence of power laws, for different characteristic quantities of such complex systems. These interesting contributions, at the interfaces of various disciplines, are often tied to various technical questions or are limited to the analysis of distribution functions, themselves considered to be the first to look at for characteristics of complex systems, but without conveying questions tied to self-organizations [\cite=soc] or external constraints [\cite=roehner2007driving].

In particular, ranking analysis has received much attention, since Zipf [\cite=z1] observed that a large number of size distributions, Nr can be approximated by a simple scaling (power) law Nr  =  N1 / r, where r is the ranking parameter, with Nr  ≥  Nr + 1, (and obviously r < r + 1). Zipf idea has led to a flurry of log-log diagrams showing a straight line through the displayed data such that "any" size distribution, more generally called yr, reads

[formula]

i.e., the so called rank-size scaling law. The scaling exponent α is considered to indicate whether the size distribution yr is close or not to some optimum (equilibrium) state [\cite=z1], i.e. when α = 1. The amplitude a can be estimated from the normalization condition. Indeed, the pure power-law distribution, for a continuous variable, known as the zeta-distribution [\cite=Edwards] [\cite=Temme] [\cite=Titchmarsh], or discrete Pareto distribution, reads

[formula]

where p(k) is the probability of observing the value k, a positive integer, γ is the power-law exponent, and ζ(γ) [formula] is the Riemann zeta function; note that γ, in Eq.([\ref=eq0]) must be greater than 1 for the Riemann zeta-function to be finite. Therefore, for the discrete distribution, Eq.([\ref=Zipfeq]), a≃kM  /  ζ(α)  ~  kM / 2, where kM is the largest value of k.

This might be the case in sport competition ranking, though the number of scales is obviously finite. Here below, an analysis of data from a specific nonlinear complex system, i.e. the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) team ranking, as a specific modern society interesting example, is discussed.

The data is described and its analysis performed in Sect. [\ref=UEFAdata] through simple empirical laws in order to introduce possible fits. The classical rank-size, hyperbolic, Eq.([\ref=Zipfeq]), relationship is not found for UEFA teams. On the contrary, after many data statistical tests (not reported), classes emerge, best seen through the use of a 3-parameter, thus generalized, Lavalette function. A top, a middle and a low class of teams appear. Several remarks serve as conclusions, in Sect. [\ref=conclusions].

Warning: it should be obvious that the ranking of a team may change from a year to another, after some season; see Appendix. There is no further consideration here on the time evolution of a team through the ranking. No doubt that the time dependence of the ranks should be of interest as well, but, due to likely economic conditions, beside sport ones, such a subject is left for dynamic evolution studies, including evolution modeling, outside the present aims.

Note, in concluding this introduction, that the literature on sport ranking is very large, in particular tied to economics questions, as in [\cite=NJP14.12093038scoreprize] [\cite=pilavci2011pitch] [\cite=barros2008identification] [\cite=barros2008efficiency]. Thus, we mention a few publications where soccer and ranking from direct measures (win, draw, loss) have been considered:

Stefani 1997 pioneering survey of the major world sports rating systems, including soccer through FIFA rules, is first to be noted [\cite=JAS24.97.635worldsportsratingStefani];

Kern and Paulusma 2001 paper discussing FIFA rules complexity for competition outcomes, leading to team ranking [\cite=DAM108.01.317], from where

Macmillan and Smith, explaining country ranking in 2007 [\cite=JSE08.07.202explainingrankingsoccercountries]; such a theme being reconsidered by

Ausloos et al. [\cite=IJMPCFIFAMARCAGNV] comparing the FIFA country ranking, based on games between national squads, to the country UEFA ranking, based on team game results, and

Constantinou and Fenton [\cite=pi-ratings] determining the level of "ability" of (five English Premier League seasons) soccer teams based on the relative discrepancies in scores between adversaries.

UEFA team coefficient data

Usually, the ranking represents the overall performance over the period of 5 consecutive seasons [\cite=UEFAteamrankingrules], after averaging points obtained in various competitions, at the end of each year (more exactly season), only for teams having participated in the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Europa League. Thus, e.g. the 2009/10 coefficient results from games having taken place in 2005/06 [formula], 2009/10. The rules are more complicated than a "win-draw-loss" rating. They depend on the success at some competition level, and differ according to the competition. A UEFA coefficient table is freely available and is updated regularly depending on the competition timing. Here below, 5 different consecutive seasons data are examined: 2009/10, [formula], 2013/14 (till May 2014).

The number of concerned teams ranges from 424 to 453 according to the season. In statistical physics terms, this is an open system, with birth and death processes. However such events mainly occur for the "not too top" teams. The statistical characteristics of the ranking distributions for the various years are given in Table [\ref=Table0914stat]. It can be noticed that the mean is increasing rather slowly, as do the skewness and kurtosis, indicating a widening of the distributions, and a kind of moving average effect, but μ  /  σ  ~  0.64 is rather stable indicating some shuffling mainly among the top teams.

Empirical Ranking Laws

Beside the classical 2-parameter power law, Eq.([\ref=Zipfeq]),

the mere exponential (2 parameter fit (b, β) case

[formula]

and the Lavalette 2-parameter free (κ2, γ) form, when the data crushes at high x-axis value, as it results from a finite size of the number N of system elements [\cite=Lavalette],

[formula]

and 3-parameter statistical distributions, like

the power law with cut-off [\cite=Pwco3]:

[formula]

and a mere generalization of Eq. ([\ref=Lavalette2]), i.e., allowing for two different exponents (γ and ξ) at low and high ranks [\cite=JoI1.07.155Mansilla] [\cite=JQL18.11.274Voloshynovska]:

[formula]

should be also considered.

Note that, in Eq. ([\ref=Lavalette2]) and Eq. ([\ref=Lavalette3a]), the role of r as the independent variable, in Eq.([\ref=Zipfeq]), is taken by the ratio r / (N  -  r  +  1) between the descending and the ascending ranking numbers. Moreover, practically at data fitting time, one can also use

[formula]

with u = r / (N + 1), emphasizing a sort of universality form. For ψ = 0, it reduces to Eq.([\ref=Zipfeq]). Observe that the slope on a log-log plot in the central region, at u = 1 / 2, is equal to - 2(φ  +  ψ).

Data Analysis

The yearly ranking of the teams as a function of their UEFA coefficient is shown in Fig. [\ref=Plot14teamrank0914lilo], on a semi-log plot; a different color and symbol are used for each year; the coefficient values have been multiplied as indicated in the inset to make the data readable. The change in curvature (near r = 200) suggests consideration of a Lavalette function for describing the data rather than a mere power law or exponential law, or their product as in Eq.([\ref=PWLwithcutoff]). These 3 laws would imply a tail at high rank.

Nevertheless, a sharp change in behavior can be noticed at very low ranks when a smooth line is drawn through the data at first. Indeed, the derivative of this guiding line for the eye has a sharp peak at a r1 value given in Table 2. Below this rank value, the best empirical law fitting the data is markedly a power law, as found on a log-log plot (not shown). The exponent is given in Table 2 as well.

For completeness, note that the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm [\cite=Levenberg44] [\cite=Marquardt63] [\cite=LMalgorithm] [\cite=ranganathan2004levenberg] has been used for the fitting procedure of the data to the mentioned non-linear functions.

Rank Classes

Next, consider an example, as in Fig. [\ref=ScreenshotPlot24fig2retried], i.e. the 2011/12 ranking distribution of the teams due to their UEFA coefficient, on a log-log plot. An overall fit by a generalized Lavalette function implies a too strong importance of the low rank coefficients, curving the fit line too strongly at moderate ranks (not shown). Observing the relatively well pronounced hyperbolic shape at very low rank, a straight (red) line, i.e., a power law fits can be made for the 6 top teams. Thereafter removing such "top class" teams from the fit, a Lavalette function fit can be attempted, as indicated by the blue dash lines. Note that the fit deviates again from the data at a shoulder rank r  ~   170. Nevertheless, the χ2 and R2 values indicate very significant fits. Similar considerations hold for the other seasons, but the data is not displayed for conciseness. It is available from the author upon request. A point should be emphasized here. Observe the change in the power law exponent between the low ranks and the medium rank ranges: from 0.17 (except for 2013/14, - which might be due to incomplete data at the time of downloading) to 0.37. Approximately the same values and changes occur in the other 3 cases. Note the high value of the ψ exponent, i.e. ~  3.0.

In order to indicate the "universality" of the findings, let the u variable, introduced here above be considered for the ranking. A log-log plot of the ranking distributions of the teams due to their UEFA coefficient as the function of the universal variable u is shown in Fig.[\ref=ScreenshotPlot4UEFA5yrsshftdu]: different colors and symbols are used for different seasons; the coefficient values have been multiplied as indicated in the inset to make the data distinguishable. The consistency is remarkable. The figure allows to emphasize the different regimes, at ~   0.015 and ~   0.20 in all cases. There are finer structures, but not so obvious ones, likely due to some reshuffling effects of the team ranks, and the sort of moving average which occurs when calculating the season rank from the five season coefficients.

The final "proof" of the classes is found in Fig. [\ref=screenshotPlot1UEFA5yrs5u] through a log-log display of the ranking distribution of the teams due to their UEFA coefficient. The "universality" is convincing. The arrows indicate deviations between fits and data, defining the low rank (u  ~  0.012, i.e. r≃6 ) "top class" teams, the "middle class" team regime, and the "low class" team regime after a shoulder for u  ~  0.35, i.e. r≃160.

Concluding remarks

The classical rank-size relationship [\cite=newman] [\cite=Brakman], underlying the description of social complex systems, has been examined for the ranking of soccer teams in UEFA competitions. The indicator of such a sport team class system has been considered to be the team UEFA coefficient. The UEFA coefficients originate from complicated rules (not discussed here) which seem to imply the creation of team classes. A sharp conclusion is first reached that the distribution of UEFA team ranking does not follow a single power law, nor an exponential, in fact. Instead of this, it appears that the rank-size distribution contains 3 classes, approximated by a mere scaling (power) law, with a quite different exponent, ≃ 1/5 or 1/3 - suggesting a sort of order-disorder phase transition, in a thermodynamics-like sense, between the low and medium rank teams. Moreover, through this log-log search for an empirical law, attempting a Lavalette function, as in other informetrics systems, the middle class is enhanced. As a moral conclusion, it seems that the UEFA rules are close to favorize a sort of Matthew effect, for the top (7 or so) teams, - which is not without recalling economic considerations [\cite=NJP14.12093038scoreprize] [\cite=pilavci2011pitch] [\cite=barros2008identification] [\cite=barros2008efficiency].

It is commonly accepted that the rich teams are those which are better ranked. There is no study here about the correlation between team richness nd UEFA ranking. It is often considered that there is some correlation, but this not completely proven [\cite=deloittetouche2013]. Indeed, the first top 10 teams do not fall permanently in the top class, as shown in the Appendix. Note that Paris St Germain is a typical outlier in this respect, not appearing in the top 10. If the content of the top class changes from one season to another, it is mainly due to the "organizing rules" for UEFA ranking, based on 5 years results in specific competitions. Since the ranking is much due to Champion's and Europa League games, indeed the ranking stems from results in such competitions.

In this respect, some physics modeling can be suggested for future work, along the lines of open systems in a necessarily non-equilibrium state. Recall that the UEFA ranking allows new teams "to come in" every year. A few can move out after 5 years. By considering a non-equilibrium ensemble of many replicas as a large, and therefore thermodynamic, system, extensive variables can be defined such that well-known thermodynamic concepts and relations can be applied to small systems. Rubi and coworkers, following Hill's line of thought [\cite=Hillbook1994] [\cite=adamrubi] have shown how to construct such a nonequilibrium thermodynamics for finite size systems too small to be considered thermodynamically in a traditional sense [\cite=RubiJPCB2006], thereby suggesting theoretical work on the rank-size relationships.

In future work, it would be of interest to examine whether the UEFA rank measure could be used to quantify a finer description of the main classes. Non universality, or class types, might also be measured through the central slope - 2(ψ  +  φ). In so doing one might also imagine weighting performances, see e.g. [\cite=JSE10.09.582weightranking] in the case of NCAA College Football Rankings, whence organizing more homogeneously based team competitions, or regulating various sport conditions implying team (but also individual athletic competitions) ranking. This may implies considerations about team budgets and expectations, - if more competitiveness is of interest to the organizers.

APPENDIX

In this Appendix, in order to illustrate a reviewer question about rank evolution, it is shown that the top teams are not always the same ones. At the end of the 09/10 and 13/14 seasons, see Table [\ref=TableUEFAteammotion], only 5 teams (underlined) are both in the top ten ranking. The other teams, either going down or up are mentioned with their season ranking.
