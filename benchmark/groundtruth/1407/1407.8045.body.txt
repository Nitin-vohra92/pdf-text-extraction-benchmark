Acyclic Subgraphs of Planar Digraphs

and David Rolnick

Introduction

A proper vertex coloring of an undirected graph G partitions the vertices into independent sets. It is natural to try to reformulate this notion for directed graphs (digraphs). An acyclic set in a digraph is a set of vertices whose induced subgraph contains no directed cycle. The acyclic chromatic number of a digraph D, denoted χA(D), is the minimal number of acyclic sets into which the vertices of D may be partitioned. In this paper, we consider oriented graphs, which are digraphs such that at most one edge connects any pair of vertices.

Although recent results [\cite=acyclic_aharoni_2008] [\cite=circular_bokal_2004] [\cite=two_harut_2012] [\cite=digraph_keevash_2013] suggest that the acyclic chromatic number behaves similarly to the undirected chromatic number, much still remains to be learned. Bokal et al. [\cite=circular_bokal_2004] credit Skrekovski with the conjecture that all oriented planar graphs have acyclic chromatic number at most 2.

Every oriented planar graph is acyclically 2-colorable.

Bokal et al. [\cite=circular_bokal_2004] showed that all oriented planar graphs are acyclically 3-colorable. One approach to Conjecture [\ref=conj:skrekovski] has been to look for lower bounds on the size of the largest acyclic set of a planar oriented graph. Borodin [\cite=borodin_acyclic_1979] showed that there must exist an acyclic set of size at least 2n / 5, where n is the number of vertices. Harutyunyan and Mohar [\cite=harut_planar_2014] ask whether, in any planar oriented graph, there exists an acyclic set of size at least n / 2. Note that this would follow immediately from Conjecture [\ref=conj:skrekovski]. Harutyunyan [\cite=harut_brooks_2011] recently conjectured an even stronger bound on the maximum size of an acyclic set:

Every oriented planar graph on n vertices contains an acyclic set of size at least 3n / 5.

Finding the largest size of an acyclic set in a digraph is equivalent to finding a set of vertices of minimum size which has a non-empty intersection with each directed cycle. In [\cite=generalized_jain_2005], Jain et al. investigated the applications of this problem in deadlock resolution.

The digirth of a directed graph is the length of its shortest directed cycle. Recently, Harutyunyan and Mohar [\cite=harut_planar_2014] proved that every oriented planar graph of digirth 5 is acyclically 2-colorable. They used an intricate vertex-discharging method to show that any minimal counterexample must contain at least one of 25 specific configurations of vertices and edges. They then demonstrated that if a digraph contains one of these configurations, the problem of finding an acyclic 2-coloring of the digraph reduces to finding an acyclic 2-coloring of a digraph with one fewer vertex, thus showing that no minimal counterexample exists. The authors posed the problem of finding a simpler approach for considering acyclic colorings in oriented planar graphs.

In this paper, we introduce such an approach in Theorem [\ref=thm:main], which improves known lower bounds on the largest acyclic set in oriented planar graphs of digirth at least 4. Specifically, we give a short proof of the fact that every planar digraph on n vertices and of digirth g possesses an acyclic set of size at least (1 - 3 / g)n. We prove this by using a corollary of the Lucchesi-Younger theorem [\cite=lucchesi_minimax_1978] to find an upper bound on the size of a minimum feedback arc set of an oriented planar graph. We also give a slightly stronger bound for the cases g  =  4 and g = 5. Our results prove Conjecture [\ref=conj:harut] when g  ≥  8.

In Section [\ref=sec:proof], we prove our main result, Theorem [\ref=thm:main]. In Section [\ref=sec:counter], we describe some potential extensions of Theorem [\ref=thm:main] and difficulties that arise.

Bounds on the largest acyclic set

In this section, we use a corollary of the Lucchesi-Younger theorem to prove Theorem [\ref=thm:main]. We begin with some definitions. Given a directed graph D and a subset X of its vertices V(D), we define [formula]. If every edge between X and X̄ is directed from X to X̄, then the set of such edges is called a directed cut. A dijoin is a set of edges that has a non-empty intersection with every directed cut.

The Lucchesi-Younger theorem [\cite=lucchesi_minimax_1978] gives the minimum size of a dijoin of a digraph:

The minimum cardinality of a dijoin in a directed graph D is equal to the maximum number of pairwise disjoint directed cuts of D.

In the case that D is planar, the Lucchesi-Younger theorem has a useful corollary for the dual of D. Given an oriented planar graph D, the dual of D, denoted [formula], is defined as follows. For a given planar embedding of D, construct a vertex of [formula] within each face of D. For each edge uv of D separating faces f and g of D, a corresponding edge [formula] is drawn between vertices [formula] and [formula]. The direction of edge [formula] is defined so that as it crosses uv, v is on the left. It is simple to verify that the graph [formula] does not depend on the planar embedding of D.

The following well-known result establishes a bijection between the directed cycles of a planar oriented graph and the directed cuts in its dual:

If D is a planar oriented graph, then the directed cycles of D are in one-to-one correspondence with the directed cuts in [formula].

Pick a planar embedding of D and embed [formula] in the plane as defined above. Given a directed cycle C in D, notice that all edges of [formula] crossing an edge of C must travel in the same direction: specifically, if C is oriented clockwise, then all edges of [formula] crossing C point inwards, and if C is oriented counterclockwise, then the edges of [formula] crossing C point outwards. Let [formula] consist of the vertices of [formula] corresponding to all faces of D inside C, and therefore the edges of [formula] connecting X and [formula] form a directed cut.

Conversely, given a directed cut of [formula], we reverse the method above to obtain a directed cycle of D.

Given a directed graph, a feedback arc set is a set of edges, the removal of which eliminates all directed cycles. We will be concerned with minimum feedback arc sets, namely those of minimum cardinality. Proposition [formula] establishes the following corollary of the Lucchesi-Younger theorem:

For a planar oriented graph, the minimum size of a feedback arc set is equal to the maximum number of arc-disjoint directed cycles.

Given a planar oriented graph D, by the Lucchesi-Younger theorem, the minimum cardinality of a dijoin of [formula] is equal to the maximum number of disjoint directed cuts of [formula]. Now, by Proposition [formula], any dijoin of [formula] corresponds to a unique feedback arc set of D of the same size, and any set of disjoint directed cuts of [formula] corresponds to a unique set of arc-disjoint directed cycles of D, also of the same size. This completes the proof.

We also need one well-known lemma, which follows easily from Euler's formula for planar graphs.

Any planar graph G with n vertices and m edges satisfies m  ≤  3n  -  6.

We now are ready to state and prove our main theorem.

If D is a planar digraph with digirth g on n vertices, then there exists an acyclic set in G of size at least n  -  3n / g. Moreover, if g  =  4, there exists an acyclic set of size at least 5n / 12, and if g  =  5, there exists an acyclic set of size at least 7n / 15.

A vertex cover of a given edge set E is a set S of vertices for which every edge in E is incident to some vertex in S. Observe that if S is a vertex cover of a feedback arc set in a digraph D, then the complement of S in D is an acyclic set. This is because every directed cycle must include an element of the feedback arc set.

Given a planar oriented graph D of digirth g, let H be a collection of arc-disjoint directed cycles, each of which must have length at least g. Thus, by Lemma [\ref=lem:mn] the number of cycles in H is at most e(D) / g  ≤  3n / g, where e(D) denotes the number of edges of D. Corollary [\ref=cor:lucchesi] implies that there exists a feedback arc set with cardinality at most 3n / g. Removing a vertex cover of this feedback arc set, we are left with an acyclic set of at least n  -  3n / g vertices.

For the cases g  =  4,5, we now derive a better bound by using the greedy algorithm to obtain a smaller vertex cover of the feedback arc set. This is possible because 3n / g  >  n / 2, meaning that some vertices are incident to 2 or more feedback arcs. Suppose that our feedback arc set consists initially of f edges, where f  ≤  3n / g.

Let d equal the number of feedback arcs minus half the number of vertices. Thus, initially d = f - n / 2. At each step, we remove the vertex v that is incident to the most feedback arcs, together with all feedback arcs incident to v. As long as d > 0, each step removes one vertex and at least two feedback arcs. Such a step decreases d by at least 3 / 2. Let m be the number of steps taken before d  ≤  0, and let d'  ≤  0 be the final value of d. We conclude that

[formula]

After m steps, the number of vertices remaining is n - m, so the number of feedback arcs remaining is d' + (n - m) / 2. We remove one vertex from each of these feedback arcs so that the vertices remaining at the end form an acyclic set. The total number of vertices removed is

[formula]

The number of vertices remaining in our acyclic set is thus at least

[formula]

This is equal to 5n / 12 for g = 4 and 7n / 15 for g = 5.

Further directions

In this section we describe methods that might be used to strengthen our main result, and difficulties that arise.

Acyclic 2-colorings

Harutyunyan and Mohar [\cite=harut_planar_2014] asked whether there is a simple proof of the fact that planar oriented graphs of large digirth are acyclically 2-colorable. We showed above that we can find a very large acyclic set in a planar digraph of large digirth. It is natural to ask whether, given a minimum feedback arc set as in Theorem [\ref=thm:main], we can choose a vertex cover Y of the feedback arc set such that Y induces an acyclic subgraph. This would imply that planar digraphs of large digirth are acyclically 2-colorable, because the subgraph induced by [formula] contains no feedback arcs and hence is acyclic. We now show that there are planar graphs for which no such Y can be found.

There exists an oriented planar graph D such that, for any minimum feedback arc set F of D, and for any vertex cover Y of F, there is a directed cycle in the subgraph induced by Y.

We show that the digraph D in Figure [\ref=fig:bigraph] satisfies the necessary conditions. The unique minimum feedback arc set {ab,bc,ac,ed,gf,hi} is indicated with dashed lines. Notice that any vertex cover of the minimum feedback arc set must contain at least 2 vertices from the central triangle abc, suppose a and b without loss of generality. We must now choose either d or e to cover edge de. However, if we choose d, then abd is a directed 3-cycle, and if we choose e, then abe is a directed 3-cycle. This completes the proof.

Improving bounds for small g

For small g, the bound we obtain in Theorem [\ref=thm:main] on the maximum acyclic set of an oriented graph on n vertices is less than n / 2, and it is natural to ask whether we can improve upon this bound. In Propositions [\ref=prop:triangle] and [\ref=prop:square], we now present two classes of planar oriented graphs, of digirth 3 and 4, respectively, for which the minimum size of a set of feedback arcs is significantly greater than n / 2. Therefore, removing one vertex from each feedback arc yields an acyclic set of size less than n / 2. Although some feedback arcs may overlap in certain vertices, as we demonstrate in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:main], applying the greedy algorithm still does not show the existence of an acyclic set of size at least n / 2. Hence these classes of graphs suggest that the methods used in Theorem [\ref=thm:main] are unlikely to prove significantly stronger bounds for digirth 3 and 4.

Given a digraph D, let f(D) denote the size of a minimum set of feedback arcs.

There exists an infinite family of digraphs D3, such that for all D∈D3:

D is planar, with digirth 3.

f(D) = |V(D)| - 2.

We define Di∈D3 recursively. Let D0 be a directed 3-cycle, and for i  ≥  0, construct Di + 1 as follows from a planar embedding of Di. Pick some face abc of Di that forms a directed 3-cycle. Construct vertices d,e,f within abc, with edges as shown in Figure [\ref=fig:triangle].

Observe that |V(Di + 1)| = |V(Di)| + 3 and f(Di + 1) = f(Di) + 3. Since |V(D0)| = 3 and f(D0) = 1, it follows by induction that f(Di) = |V(Di)| - 2 for every i. By construction, Di is planar and has digirth 3.

There exists an infinite family of digraphs D4, such that for all D∈D4:

D is planar, with digirth 4.

[formula].

As with D3, we define Di∈D4 recursively. Let D0 be a directed 4-cycle, and for i  ≥  0, construct Di + 1 as follows from a planar embedding of Di. Pick some face abcd of Di that forms a directed 4-cycle. Construct vertices e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l within abcd, with edges as shown in Figure [\ref=fig:square].

Observe that |V(Di + 1)| = |V(Di)| + 8 and f(Di + 1) = f(Di) + 5. Since |V(D0)| = 4 and f(D0) = 1, it follows by induction that [formula] for every i. By construction, Di is planar and has digirth 4.

We have defined a class of digraphs D3 by recursive addition of an octahedral pattern, and a class D4 by recursive addition of a cuboctahedral pattern. It is possible to define a similar class D5, containing planar digraphs of digirth 5, by recursive addition of an icosidodecahedral pattern. However, the resulting relation on f(D) falls short of |V(D)| / 2:

[formula]

Thus, for D∈D5, removing a vertex from each of a minimum set of feedback arcs yields an acyclic set of size greater than |V(D)| / 2. We cannot say whether the methods of Theorem [\ref=thm:main] may hold for general planar graphs of digirth 5.
