A lower bound on tunnel number degeneration

The tunnel number t(K) of a knot K  ⊂  S3 can be defined by the equation t(K) + 1 = g(S3  -  η(K)), where g(  ·  ) denotes Heegaard genus and η(K) is an open regular neighborhood of K. In more intuitive terms, the tunnel number of a knot is the minimal number of "tunnels" that must be drilled through S3  -  η(K) in order to make the resulting manifold a handlebody.

The behavior of t(K) under the operation of connected sum has been studied extensively. It is not difficult to see that t(K1  #  K2)  ≤  t(K1) + t(K2) + 1, although it takes some work to find examples where equality is achieved in this bound [\cite=kobri], [\cite=morrub], [\cite=mor2]. It is also known that t(K1  #  K2) < t(K1) + t(K2) for some pairs of knots [\cite=mor3], [\cite=nog], [\cite=schir], and that the degeneration t(K1) + t(K2) - t(K1  #  K2) can be arbitrarily large [\cite=kob], [\cite=schir].

Perhaps most difficult is the task of finding lower bounds on t(K1  #  K2). It is known that t(K1  #  K2)  ≥  2 for any pair of non-trivial knots in S3 [\cite=norwood], and more generally that [formula] [\cite=schulschar2]. In the case that K1 and K2 are small, it is known that t(K1  #  K2) = t(K1) + t(K2) [\cite=morimoto-schultens] (the hard part of this is to show that t(K1  #  K2)  ≥  t(K1) + t(K2)), in fact this equation holds even under the assumption that K1 and K2 are meridionally small [\cite=kobayashi-rieck]. Another impressive lower bound is [formula] [\cite=schulschar], which holds for any pair of non-trivial knots in S3 (in fact a more general analogue involving iterated connected sums is derived in [\cite=schulschar]).

In this paper, we prove that t(K1  #  K2)  ≥   max {t(K1),t(K2)} for any pair of knots K1,K2  ⊂  S3. This bound was previously unknown, although there are many examples which show it to be best possible, including those of [\cite=mor3] and [\cite=nog]. The proof is centered around the rather involved construction of so-called doppelgänger surfaces.

In rough outline, the strategy of our proof is as follows. Suppose without loss of generality that max {t(K1),t(K2)} = t(K2) and let K1  #  K2 be realized via the satellite construction with K1 as the companion and K2 as the pattern. This means that K1  #  K2 lies in [formula], and if h:V  →  S3 is the standard unknotted embedding of the solid torus V, then h(K1  #  K2) = K2. If G is a thin generalized Heegaard surface of S3  -  η(K1  #  K2), then G can be isotoped to intersect [formula] in a particularly nice way. Taking into account certain information contained in the intersection [formula], we can then construct the previously mentioned doppelgänger surface Q inside of a solid torus [formula] which, in certain important respects, imitates the placement of the surface [formula] in [formula]. As a result, [formula] forms a generalized Heegaard surface of [formula] which amalgamates to a surface of lower genus than the amalgamation of G. This yields the desired lower bound.

In Section 1 we introduce the notion of a generalized compression body, which form the basic pieces of [formula] and W - Q, and prove a series of essential cutting and pasting lemmas about them. Section 2 then describes and works out the basic topology of so-called spoke graphs and spoke surfaces, which form the building blocks of the doppelgänger surface Q. Section 3 then constructs Q in detail and proves that it has the desired properties, culminating in the main technical result of the paper, Theorem 3.23. In Section 4 the bound t(K1  #  K2)  ≥   max {t(K1),t(K2)} is proved (Theorem 4.1), and some topics related to it are briefly discussed.

Throughout this paper, N(Y,X) denotes a closed regular neighborhood of Y in X, [formula], and [formula], or equivalently, [formula]. We assume throughout that N(Y,X) behaves well with respect to intersection, so that [formula]. If X is a topological space, |X| denotes the number of components of X. An embedding of manifolds f:X  →  Y is said to be proper if f is transverse to ∂Y and f(∂X)  ⊂  ∂Y. A proper isotopy is a homotopy through proper embeddings (note that this does not imply that the boundary remains fixed). As an informal aid to the reader, topological spaces which are allowed to have multiple connected components will usually be denoted in calligraphic font, e.g. A, X, Y, whereas connected topological spaces will usually be denoted in standard font, e.g. A, X, Y.

Generalized compression bodies

Let F be a compact orientable surface, and let [formula], where the 2-handles are attached along essential, non-boundary parallel curves in F  ×  {0}, and 3-handles are attached along all spherical components of [formula] which are disjoint from F  ×  {1}. Then V is called a generalized compression body over F, or simply a generalized compression body. Let ∂+V  =  F  ×  {1}, ∂vV = (∂F)  ×  I, and [formula]. If V is connected and [formula], V is a compression body. If V is connected and [formula], V is a handlebody.

Let V be a generalized compression body and let [formula] and [formula] be disjoint unions of annuli embedded in ∂+V satisfying [formula]. Let [formula] be a disjoint union of compressing disks for V such that ∂D  ⊂  ∂+V. If [formula] consists of a single spanning arc in one of Ai or Ai' for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  n, and [formula] if j > i, then D is said to be a primitive disk set for [formula], and the component of [formula] which meets Di is said to be dual to Di. The above orderings of the components of [formula] and D will be called the primitive ordering associated with D. See Figure 1.

Let V be a generalized compression body and let [formula] and [formula] be disjoint unions of annuli embedded in ∂+V satisfying [formula]. Let h:A  →  A' be an orientation reversing homeomorphism such that h(Ai) = Ai' for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  n, and suppose that [formula] admits a primitive disk set. Then V / h is a generalized compression body over (∂+V) / h.

We proceed by induction on n. In the base case n = 0 there is nothing to prove. If n > 0, suppose without loss of generality that An is dual to Dn (the argument is the same if An' is dual Dn). By Observation 1.3, E(Dn,V) is again a generalized compression body, and the result of reattaching N(Dn) to E(Dn,V) via the map [formula] again results in a generalized compression body V', since this amounts to trivially attaching a ball to ∂+E(Dn,V) along a disk on its boundary. Since V / h|An is obtained from V' via a 1-handle attachment along ∂+V', Observation 1.3 tells us that V / h|An is a generalized compression body. Since [formula] was disjoint from [formula] and Dn, it remains a primitive disk set for [formula] and [formula] in V / h|An, and the desired conclusion follows by induction.

Suppose V is a generalized compression body, let [formula] be a disjoint union of annuli embedded in ∂+V, and let [formula] be a disjoint union of disks properly embedded in V such that ∂D  ⊂  ∂+V. If [formula] consists of a single spanning arc in Ai for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  n, and [formula] whenever i < j, then manifold W obtained by attaching 2-handles along A is again a generalized compression body.

The proposition is well known in the case the V is a compression body. The proof in the general case here is essentially the same as that of Proposition 1.6.

An annulus A properly embedded in a generalized compression body V is said to be spanning if one component of ∂A lies on ∂+V and the other lies on ∂-V. A is said to be horizontal if ∂A  ⊂  ∂+V.

If F is a compact surface and A is a disjoint union of incompressible spanning annuli embedded in F  ×  I, then F  ×  I can be re-parameterized so that A  =  C  ×  I for some disjoint union of essential simple closed curves C  ⊂  F.

This is a well known fact which often appears in the literature, so the following proof is merely a sketch. If [formula], then C  ×  I is another union of spanning annuli A' such that [formula] is isotopic to [formula] in F  ×  {1} (this follows from the π1-injectivity of A and A'). This allows A' to be properly isotoped so that ∂A' and ∂A are parallel and disjoint in F  ×  {0,1}. Since A and A' are both incompressible, and F  ×  I is irreducible, any simple closed curves in [formula] which are trivial in either of A' or A can be eliminated via further isotopy of A' using standard inner-most disk arguments. Again, since each component of [formula] is π1-injective, any remaining components of [formula] must come from pairs of annuli A,A' with isotopic boundaries on F  ×  {0,1}. Thus these components of [formula] can also be removed, uppermost ones first, using the fact that any incompressible horizontal annulus in F  ×  I with parallel boundary components will co-bound a solid torus with an annulus on F  ×  {1}. Once A' has been made disjoint from A, the components of [formula] will co-bound solid tori with annuli in F  ×  {0,1}, so that A' can finally be isotoped onto A. Extending this proper isotopy of A' to an ambient isotopy of F  ×  I yields the desired reparameterization.

Let V be a compression body and let [formula] be a disjoint union of incompressible annuli properly embedded in V, so that every component of As is spanning and every component of Ah is horizontal. Then E(A,V) is a generalized compression body V' such that ∂v(V') = Fr(As) and Fr(Ah)  ⊂  ∂+V'. Moreover, for an appropriate ordering of the components of [formula], if we set [formula], [formula], and [formula], then the collection [formula] admits a primitive disk set in V'.

Lemma 2 of [\cite=schul] tells us that W = E(Ah,V) is a union of compression bodies. The annuli As remain spanning in W, thus are disjoint from some union of disks E properly embedded in W such that [formula] (see, e.g., Lemma 3.15 of [\cite=saitoschulschar]). By Proposition 1.9, we may assume that E(E,W) has been parameterized so that As has the form C  ×  I in ∂-W  ×  I, where C  ⊂  ∂-W is a disjoint union of simple closed curves. Thus V' = E(As,W) = E(A,V) is a generalized compression body satisfying ∂vV' = Fr(As), as claimed.

We prove the second part by induction on n. There is nothing to prove if n = 0. If n > 0, then Lemma 9 of [\cite=Bonahon-Otal] implies that Ah is boundary-compressible in V via some disk D1. We may choose D1 so that it is disjoint from As, and we assign the label A1 to the component of Ah which has been boundary-compressed by D1. By the first part of this lemma, [formula] is a generalized compression body and so by induction Fr(Ah - A1) admits a primitive disk set D' in V' = E(A,V) with respect to an appropriate choice of numbering for Ah - A1, with A2 as the lowest indexed annulus. We may also choose (appropriately indexed) D' so that [formula], and since [formula], it follows that [formula] is a primitive disk set for Fr(Ah) in V', as required.

A graph X embedded in a manifold M is said to be properly embedded if X is transverse to M and [formula] is a union of elements from the set of univalent vertices of X. X is said to be unknotted if it can be isotoped into ∂M via an isotopy Φ:X  ×  I  →  M such that the function Φ|{t}  ×  X is a proper embedding for all 0  ≤  t < 1.

Let X be a graph embedded in a handlebody V such that [formula]. Then X is called a spine of V.

Suppose X is a graph embedded in the interior of a handlebody V, and that there is a disjoint union of compressing disks D properly embedded in V so that the following are true:

E(D,V) is a union of balls,

[formula] is a properly embedded, unknotted tree for each component B of E(D,V),

For each component D of D, [formula] is a single point on an edge of X.

Then X is a spine of V.

For each component B of E(D,V), let E  ⊂  ∂B be the set of "scars" left behind by cutting along D, i.e. [formula], and let [formula]. Then hypotheses (2) and (3) give us a homeomorphism h:F  ×  I  →  E(X',B) as per Observation 1.12, where we may take [formula]. These homeomorphisms can then be pasted together to form a homeomorphism between E(X,V) and ∂V  ×  I.

Suppose V is a handlebody with spine X, and that Y is a subgraph of X without simply connected components. Then E(Y,V) is a compression body.

E(Y,V) is obtained from [formula] by attaching 2-handles and 3-handles along ∂V  ×  {0}.

A Heegaard splitting (V,W,G) of a manifold M is a decomposition [formula] where each of V,W is a compression body and [formula]. G is called a Heegaard surface. The Heegaard genus g(M) of a manifold is the minimal genus of a Heegaard surface for M.

A generalized Heegaard splitting [formula] of a manifold M is a decomposition [formula] such that (Vi,Wi,Gi) forms a Heegaard splitting for the submanifold Mi, [formula] for 1  ≤  i < n, and [formula] whenever else i  ≠  j (we include the case n = 1 corresponding to standard Heegaard splittings). The surface [formula] is called a generalized Heegaard surface. Given a generalized Heegaard surface G, we let [formula] denote the thick surfaces of G, and G-  =  G  -  G+ denote the thin surfaces of G.

A Heegaard splitting (V,W,G) is said to be:

Stabilized if there exist compressing disks D  ⊂  V, D'  ⊂  W such that [formula] is a single point.

Reducible if there exist compressing disks D  ⊂  V, D'  ⊂  W such that ∂D  =  ∂D'.

Weakly reducible if it is not stabilized or reducible, but there are compressing disks D  ⊂  V, D'  ⊂  W such that [formula]

Strongly irreducible if it is not stabilized and, for all compressing disks D  ⊂  V, D'  ⊂  W, [formula]

[\cite=scharthomp] If (V,W,G) is a weakly reducible Heegaard splitting of M, then (V,W,G) can be untelescoped to a generalized Heegaard splitting ((V1,W1,G1), [formula] such that (Vi,Wi,Gi) is a strongly irreducible splitting of Mi for each 1  ≤  i  ≤  n, and the thin surfaces Fi are incompressible in M for each 1  ≤  i < n. In this case the generalized splitting is said to be fully untelescoped. A standard Heegaard splitting that is strongly irreducible will also be considered fully untelescoped.

[\cite=schulschar2] If G is the union of the thick and thin surfaces of a fully untelescoped Heegaard splitting of M, and T is an incompressible surface properly embedded in M, then G can be isotoped so that it meets T only in simple closed curves which are non-trivial in both G and T.

Spoke surfaces in the solid torus

Let X  ⊂  W be an embedded graph with one central vertex x0 at (φ0,0,0), a finite number of outer vertices [formula], one radial edge connecting each outer vertex xi to the central vertex x0, and one longitunidal edge li = S1  ×  {xi} connecting xi to itself, 1  ≤  i  ≤  n. Then X is said to be a connected spoke graph in W. A finite, disjoint union of connected spoke graphs X is simply called a spoke graph, Fr(X) is called a spoke surface, E(X,W) is a spoke chamber.

Suppose X is a connected spoke graph with central vertex at (φ0,0,0). Let D be a disjoint union of disks embedded in [formula] such that for each component D of D,

[formula] is a connected subarc of a radial edge of X,

[formula].

Then [formula] is called a stabilized spoke graph with stabilizing disk set D, [formula] is a stabilized spoke surface, and [formula] is a stabilized spoke chamber. Moreover, [formula] is called the set of stabilizing arcs of X.

Let X be a connected stabilized spoke graph with stabilizing disk set D and central vertex at (φ0,0,0). Let [formula], and let [formula], where V = E(X,W). Then the standard disk set of X is the union of disks [formula].

Let X be a connected, stabilized spoke graph with stabilizing disk set D, and whose central vertex has φ-coordinate φ1. Let X' be another connected, stabilized spoke graph disjoint from X with stabilizing disk set D', whose central vertex has φ-coordinate φ2  ≠  φ1, and suppose the following properties are also satisfied:

The set of longitudinal edges of X' is precisely the set of core curves of the annuli [formula].

[formula].

Every component of D of D meets precisely one component D' of D' in a single arc which has one endpoint on ∂D - X, and the other on ∂D' - X', and conversely each component of D' meets precisely one component of D in this way.

Let h be the projection S1  ×  D2  →  S1. Then [formula] is circle-valued Morse function without singularities, and for every stabilizing arc α of X, h|α is Morse with only one critical point occurring at [formula]. Likewise for the stabilizing disks and arcs of X'.

Then X and X' are said to be dual to one another. See Figure 2.

Let X and X' be a dual pair of connected spoke surfaces in W, and let B be the component of [formula] which contains the central vertex of X', where DX is the standard disk set of X from Definition 2.4. Then B is a ball, and [formula] is an unknotted tree properly embedded in B.

It is clear that B is a ball, we show that [formula] is unknotted. We retain the notation of Definition 2.6 throughout. If C is the set of stabilizing arcs of X', then the Morse condition on C ensures that [formula] is Morse without singularities, and since [formula] is also Morse without singularities, we can slide the endpoints of [formula] off of [formula] without introducing any further singularities. The components of [formula] can then be "pushed in" so that ∂B - ∂W is level with respect to h, and the arcs of [formula] can then be properly isotoped horizontally with respect to h until they are vertical. After these isotopies, it is clear that [formula] is unknotted.

If X and X' are connected, dual, stabilized spoke graphs, then [formula] is homeomorphic to Fr(X)  ×  I via a map sending Fr(X') to Fr(X)  ×  {0} and Fr(X) to Fr(X)  ×  {1}.

Take the double of W to obtain S1  ×  S2, let Xd be the double of of X, and let Xd' be the double of X'. Then E(Xd,S1  ×  S2) is a handlebody, since the double E of the standard disk set DX cuts E(Xd,S1  ×  S2) into balls. Moreover, E(Xd,S1  ×  S2), E, and Xd' satisfy the hypotheses of Proposition 1.14 (Lemma 2.8 handles the only subtle aspect of this). Thus Xd' is a spine of E(Xd,S1  ×  S2), and we obtain a parameterization [formula]. By Proposition 1.9, the spanning annuli [formula] can be assumed to be vertical with respect to this parameterization, and the result follows.

Let X be a disjoint union of stabilized spoke graphs embedded in W. Then two components X1 and X2 of X are said to be:

φ-adjacent if there is a subarc β  ⊂  S1 such that the β  ×  {0}  ⊂  W meets X only in the central vertices of X1 and X2, on its endpoints. In this case we call β  ×  {0} the spanning arc of φ-adjacency.

θ-adjacent if the closure A of some component of [formula] meets N(X1,W) in one boundary component and N(X2,W) in the other. In this case A is said to be a spanning annulus of θ-adjacency.

Let X be a disjoint union of stabilized spoke graphs whose components are ordered [formula] so that Xi is φ-adjacent to Xi + 1, and let αi be the spanning arc of φ-adjacency for Xi, Xi + 1, 1  ≤  i < n. Then [formula] is said to be the binding arc of X with respect to the given ordering of its components.

Suppose further that Xi is θ-adjacent to Xi + 1, and let Ai be a spanning annulus of θ-adjacency for Xi, Xi + 1, 1  ≤  i < n. Then [formula] is said to form an adjacency chain for X with respect to the given ordering of its components.

Let X be a disjoint union of stabilized spoke graphs (possibly with detached longitudes), and let X be a connected stabilized spoke graph (possibly with detached longitudes) obtained from X by rotating each component of X in the φ-direction so that all of their central vertices coincide at a single vertex x0. Then X is said to be a decomposition of X. If d(x0,v) < ε, for every central vertex v occurring in a component of X, where [formula] is the flat metric, then X is said to be an ε-small decomposition of X.

Let X1 and X2 be a pair of components in X which are φ- and θ-adjacent, with spanning arc of φ-adjacency α and spanning annulus of θ-adjacency A. Let D be disk embedded in W such that [formula], where ei is the radial edge of Xi nearest to A, i = 1,2, β  ⊂  ∂W is an arc joining e1 to e2 which spans A, and [formula]. Then D is said to be a spanning disk of X1 and X2. See Figure 3.

Let hε:W  →  W be the dilation (φ,r,θ)  ↦  (φ,(1 - ε)r,θ). Let X be a stabilized spoke graph, let L be a union of longitudinal edges of X, let E be the union of those radial edges of X which meet L, and let S be the union of stabilizing arcs attached to E. Then the graph X' obtained by removing [formula] from X and attaching [formula] is said to be a spoke graph obtained by ε-small detachments of the longitudes h(L).

Suppose X and X' are dual stabilized spoke graphs embedded in W, that ε  <  π / 2, and that d(X,X') > ε (as usual d is the flat metric). Suppose X is an ε / 8-small, good decomposition of X, and that [formula] is an adjacency chain of annuli for X. Let Y be a spoke subgraph of X' which does not meet A, and suppose Y is obtained from an ε / 8-small longitudinal detachments Y followed by an ε / 8-small decomposition (which need not be "good"). Let A' be the subset of [formula] consisting of those annuli which meet Fr(X) on one boundary component, and Fr(Y) on the other. Then [formula] is a generalized compression body V such that ∂vV = A' and ∂-V = Fr(Y).

We have chosen the various stabilizations and detachments small enough to ensure that they can all be carried simultaneously without creating new intersections. As in the proof of Lemma 2.9, we double W to obtain S1  ×  S2, let Xd denote the double of X, and let Xd' be the double of X'. Then if Y' is the graph obtained by detaching some of the longitudes of Y, it remains isotopic to a subgraph of Xd', which is a spine of E(Xd,S1  ×  S2). Thus [formula] is a compression body with negative boundary ∂N(Y').

If Y is any ε / 8-small decomposition of Y', then [formula] is also compression body because Observation 2.15 tells us that it is obtained from [formula] via 2-handle attachments along [formula]. The annuli A' are the spanning annuli in the collection [formula] of incompressible annuli properly embedded in [formula], and thus form the vertical boundary of the generalized compression body [formula] cut off by [formula].

Order the components of [formula] so that Ai meets N(Xi,W) and N(Xi + 1,W) for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  k. The hypothesis that Y does not meet [formula] implies the existence of a spanning disk Di for each pair Xi, Xi + 1 which is disjoint from Y. If αi is the spanning arc of φ-adjacency for Xi, Xi + 1, then the meridian disk Di' of αi in [formula] meets the disk [formula] in a single point. Thus by Proposition 1.7, [formula], which is obtained by attaching N(Di') to [formula] for each 1  ≤  i  ≤  k, is also a generalized compression body.

The Doppelgänger

G and T are said to be well-configured with respect to M1 if the following conditions hold:

[formula] consists only of simple closed curves which are essential in T and G,

Each component of [formula] separates M1,

For each component V of E(G,M), [formula] consists only of annuli which are spanning or horizontal.

Let V be a component of [formula]. Let [formula], let [formula], [formula], [formula], and let AVp consist of those components of AVh which are dual to some component of DV.

For every component V of V, ∂+V - AVp is connected.

In the case |AVp| = 0 there is nothing to prove, so assume |AVp| > 0. Order the components of [formula] so that i < j if Di has lower index than Dj with respect to the primitive ordering of D. Similarly, order [formula] so that i < j if Ai has lower index than Aj with respect to the primitive ordering of Ah (so Di is dual Ai for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  k). The fact that D is primitive implies that ∂D1 meets AVp only in a single spanning arc of A1, so that A1 meets a single component of [formula]. Likewise, ∂D2 is disjoint from [formula] and meets A2 only in a single spanning arc. Since ∂D2 does not change the component of ∂+V - AVp on which it lies when it passes through A1, it follows that A2 also meets the same component of [formula] on each side. Continuing in this way for the remaining components of AVp, we see that every component of AVp meets a single component of [formula]. Since ∂+V is connected, this implies that ∂+V - AVp is also connected.

Let V be a component of V, and index the annuli [formula] so that i < j implies that Ai has lower index than Aj with respect to the primitive ordering on Ah. A set [formula] of components of AVh  -  AVp is said to be connective if [formula] is connected. Moreover, [formula] is minimal if (1) [formula] is minimal among all connective sets of V and, (2) for every other connective set of annuli [formula] satisfying [formula], il  ≤  jl for all 1  ≤  l  ≤  k. Note that conditions (1) and (2) define a unique minimal connective set with respect to any given ordering.

For each component V of [formula] which meets T1, let BV denote [formula] which is a union of annuli.

For each component V of [formula], and each component B of BV, both components of h- 1(∂B) lie on the same component of [formula].

If the curves of h- 1(∂B) lie on distinct components F1,F2 of ∂V - AV, then we can construct an embedded curve in M1 which is the union of a spanning arc α of h- 1(B) and an arc β properly embedded in V with ∂α  =  ∂β. This curve would then intersect the surface F1 in a single point, which contradicts the assumption that each component of [formula] (and hence each component of [formula]), is separating in M1.

Let V be a component of [formula], and let F be a component of [formula] that meets T1. Let BF be the union of those components B of BV such that h- 1(∂B)  ⊂  F. If X is a connected, stabilized spoke graph, possibly with detached longitudes, whose non-detached longitudinal edges are the core curves of BF, then X is said to be a doppelgänger spoke graph for F.

Let V be a component of [formula], and let [formula] be a spoke graph constructed as follows:

Let BV+ be the union of those annuli in BV which appear in BF for some component F of [formula], let X be a connected stabilized spoke graph whose longitudinal edges are the core curves of BV+, and let X' be its dual. Suppose d(X,X') = ε  <  π / 2, where d is the flat metric on W as in Lemma 2.17.

Suppose [formula] is the minimal connective set of components of AVh  -  AVp defined in Definition 3.8. For some pair of components of [formula], label them Fj and Fj + 1, ∂Aij has one component in ∂Fj and the other in ∂Fj + 1. Since [formula] was chosen to be minimal, Fj will be distinct from Fl whenever j  ≠  l, (otherwise we could remove an element of [formula] and still have a connective set). On the other hand, since [formula] is connective, [formula]. Thus there exists an ε / 8-small decomposition X of X such that [formula], where XFj is a doppelgänger spoke graph of Fj, and moreover X can be chosen so that [formula] forms an adjacency chain for X, where here Cj denotes the component of [formula] which contains h(Aij) (see Definition 2.12).

Let BV-  =  BV  -  BV+, which is the union of those annuli in BV which appear in BF for some component F of ∂-V that meets T1. Every component of ∂W - X contains at most one component of BV-, for if two components of BV- both lied in the same component of ∂W - X, this would imply the existence of a component of AV whose boundary components both lie in ∂-V, contrary to part (3) of Definition 3.2. Thus we may assume that the core curves of BV- form a subset of the longitudinal edges of the dual X' of X.

Define the prohibited longitudinal edges of X' to be those which lie in the same component of ∂W - X as a component of [formula] (there is at most one component of this set lying inside each component of ∂W - X). A subgraph Y' of X' is said to be admissable if it possesses every core curve of BV- as a longitudinal edge, but no prohibited longitudinal edges.

It is possible that [formula], in which case we set [formula]. Otherwise, let [formula] be the components of ∂-V which meet T1. Let Y' be an admissible subgraph of X', and let Y be obtained from Y' via an ε / 8-small detachment of those longitudes of Y' which are not core curves of BV-. Finally, let [formula] be an ε / 8-small decomposition of Y, where YFj' is a doppelgänger spoke graph for Fj', 1  ≤  j  ≤  l.

Then [formula] is said to be a doppelgänger spoke graph of V, and it is said to be perfect if [formula] and [formula] for all 1  ≤  j  ≤  k, 1  ≤  r  ≤  l.

Let V be a component of [formula], let [formula] be a doppelgänger spoke graph of V, and let [formula]. Suppose [formula] is ordered as in Definition 3.8, and that [formula]. Then there is an ordered, disjoint collection of disks [formula] properly embedded in U with the following properties:

[formula],

[formula] is a single spanning arc for all 1  ≤  j  ≤  q,

[formula] for all 1  ≤  j  ≤  q, pj < l  ≤  m.

For each component Al of AVh, let Cl denote the closure of the component of [formula] which contains h(Al). Let [formula] be the minimal connective set for AVh, and order the components of [formula] so that the components of ∂Cij lie in Fr(Xj) and Fr(Xj + 1) for all 1  ≤  j  ≤  k. In the next two paragraphs we describe the components Epj of EV.

Suppose first that ∂Cpj lies on a single component Fr(Xr) of Fr(X), where Xr has central vertex v = (φ0,0,0). In the notation of part (4) of Definition 3.13, Y' must be disjoint from Cpj, since the longitude of X' that lies in Cpj is prohibited (Cpj contains a component of AVp by definition). Hence Y is disjoint from the component of [formula] that meets Cpj. We will let Epj denote this component, which is a disk properly embedded [formula]. Call this kind of disk a simple disk.

If the components of ∂Cpj lie on distinct components Fr(Xr) and Fr(Xs) of Fr(X), r < s, then the disk we need to construct is a bit more complex. First let G be the union of the spanning disks (recall Definition 2.16) for the annuli [formula], and let D be the spanning disk of Cpj. Then let Epj be the disk [formula], which again is disjoint from Y by part (4) of Definition 3.14, and is thus properly embedded in [formula]. Call this kind of disk a disk with flaps, see Figure 4.

A simple disk is disjoint from all the other disks defined above, and any disks with flaps which overlap one another can also be isotoped slightly to be disjoint from one another. The resulting collection of disks is our collection EU. Obviously EU satisfies conclusions (1) and (2). Conclusion (3) is also clear in the case that Epj is simple, since in fact the only annulus of the form h(Al) which it meets is h(Apj).

In the case that Epj has flaps, condition (2) on minimality for [formula] given in Definition 3.8 ensures that the index of Epj is higher than that of every element element [formula] such that [formula]. Otherwise we could replace Al with Apj in [formula] to obtain another connective set which violates the minimality of [formula]. Since Epj meets no other annuli of the form h(Al) except for h(Apj), the final condition is satisfied.

For every component V of [formula], there is a perfect doppelgänger spoke graph embedded in W.

For any doppelgänger spoke graph XF of a component F of [formula], the surface Fr(XF,W) will have the same number of boundary components as F. Moreover, the genus of Fr(XF,W) is the same as the total number of stabilizing arcs and detached longitudes that occur in XF. In particular, if XF is unstabilized and has no detached longitudes, then Fr(XF,W) will be planar. Thus a doppelgänger spoke graph XF can always be found which satisfies [formula] after attaching a sufficient number of stabilizing arcs and/or detached longitudes.

In part (1) of Definition 3.14, we have the flexibility to stabilize X as often as we need, with stabilizing arcs based on radial edges of our choosing. This allows us to choose the number of stabilizing arcs that will eventually occur in the components of the spoke graph X defined in part (2) of Definition 3.14. It follows from this and the previous paragraph that we may choose X so that each of its components XFj satisfies [formula].

As noted in Remark 2.7, the Morse condition of Definition 2.6 grants us enough flexibility to choose the radial edges on which the stabilizing arcs of X' (the dual of X) will be based, and this in turn allows us to control the component of Y on which they will eventually occur in part (5) of Definition 3.14. Likewise, we can choose the components of Y on which the detached longitudes of Y shall occur after the decomposition described in part (5) of Definition 3.14.

So, similar to the case with X, we may distribute detached longitudes and stabilizing arcs among the components of Y however we please. But there is an important difference: The total number of stabilizing arcs and detached longitudes that can occur in Y is bounded above by s + a, where s denotes the number of stabilizing arcs that occur in X, and a denotes the maximal number of detached longitudes that can occur on an admissible subgraph of X' (as defined in part (4) of Definition 3.14). Therefore, to complete the proof we must show that a total of s + a stabilizing arcs and detached longitudes is always sufficient to create a spoke graph Y which satisfies the equation [formula] for each of its components YFj'.

As in part (5) of Definition 3.14, let [formula] be the union of those components of ∂-V which meet T1. By the first paragraph of this proof, the total number of stabilizing arcs and detached longitudes necessary to ensure that [formula] for all 1  ≤  j  ≤  l is equal to [formula], where g(Fj') is the genus of Fj'. Since [formula] for any connected, compact surface F, we obtain

[formula]

The fact that this quantity is less than s + a is ultimately derived from the inequality

[formula]

The truth of (2) can be seen as follows: V' = E(DV,V) is a generalized compression body with the same negative boundary as V. Furthermore, ∂+V' is connected since ∂+V - ∂DV is connected, as can be seen using essentially the same proof as that of Lemma 3.7. Now ∂-V' is obtained from ∂+V' via surgeries along disks, and there must be at least |∂-V'| - 1 such surgeries since ∂+V' is connected. Thus χ(∂+V') - χ(∂-V')  ≤   - 2(|∂-V'| - 1). Inequality (2) now follows from the fact that ∂-V' = ∂-V, and the fact that χ(∂+V') = χ(∂+V) + 2|DV| = χ(∂+V) + 2|AVp|.

Since no component of ∂-V is a disk or sphere, and F'  ⊂  ∂-V, χ(∂-V)  ≤  χ(F'). Thus from (2) we easily obtain the analogue χ(∂+V) - χ(F')  ≤   - 2(|AVp| + |F'| - 1). In conjunction with equation (1), we obtain

[formula]

Our choice of X has ensured that χ(∂+V) = χ(Fr(X,W)). We then compute χ(Fr(X,W)) =  - |∂Fr(X,W)| - 2s + 2|Fr(X,W)| =  - 2|AVh| - |AVs| - 2s + 2|X|, and so deduce

[formula]

The detached longitudes of Y, as described in part (5) of Definition 3.14, all come from core curves of the annuli of ∂W - X which contain a component of h(AVh). On the other hand, the number of prohibited annuli (part (4) of Definition 3.14) is equal to [formula] (where [formula] denotes the set of annuli defined in part (2) of Definition 3.14). Hence there will be at most [formula] detached longitudes which may occur in Y. However, [formula] by the minimality of [formula]. Plugging this into inequality (4) yields

[formula]

The lemma now follows.

Let V be a component of [formula], let GV denote the union of those components G of [formula] such that [formula]. Let [formula] be a perfect doppelgänger spoke graph for V, and let QV be the result of isotoping [formula] so that [formula], via an isotopy supported in N(BV,W) (here [formula] is the union of annuli described in Definition 3.11). Then QV is called the doppelgänger surface of V, and the closure of the component of W - QV which does not contain [formula] is the doppelgänger chamber of V.

Let X be a connected, unstabilized spoke graph and let X' be its dual. Suppose Y is obtained from X by attaching a total of n stabilizing arcs and detached longitudes, and that Y' is obtained from X' by attaching a total of n stabilizing arcs and detached longitudes, in any fashion. Then Fr(Y,W) is properly isotopic to Fr(Y',W) in W.

If Y has detached longitudes, then there is a sequence of edge slides which change Y into a connected stabilized spoke graph [formula] without detached longitudes (see Figure 5), and these correspond to an isotopy of Fr(Y,W) to Fr(,W), one which we can choose to be supported outside of a small open collar of ∂W.

We may then isotope Fr(,W) onto Fr(',W) via a "sweepout" isotopy, where ' is the dual of [formula]. We will call this the sweepout stage of the isotopy between the surfaces. Note that it is the only stage of the isotopy during which the boundary of our surface is not fixed.

Finally, since ' is obtained from X' by attaching n stabilizing arcs, using (a reversed version of) the same kind of isotopy described in the first paragraph, we may slide the stabilizing arcs of ' along X' so that they coincide with the stabilizing arcs and detached longitudes of Y'. This corresponds to an isotopy of Fr(',W) onto Fr(Y',W) which fixes ∂Fr(',W). Composing these istopies yields the result.

Let V and V' be a pair of components of [formula], and let GV, GV' be defined as in Definition 3.18. Then V and V' are said to be adjacent if [formula].

Suppose V and V' are an adjacent pair of components of [formula]. Then [formula] consists of a single component, call it G. Moreover, if QV and QV' are the component of QV and QV', respectively, which satisfy h(∂G) = ∂QV  =  ∂QV', then QV is isotopic to QV' in W via an isotopy which fixes ∂QV.

If [formula] had at least two components G1 and G2, then we could embed a simple closed curve ω  ⊂  M1 which meets each of V, V', N(G1,M1) and N(G2,M1) in a single arc. Since ω meets G1 in a single point, this contradicts our assumption that each component of [formula] is separating in M1. Thus there is exactly one component, G, of [formula].

Let [formula] and [formula]. Then F is a component of [formula], F' is a component of [formula], and we let XF, XF' denote the corresponding perfect doppelgänger spoke graphs which give rise to QV and QV'. Setting XF = Y and XF' = Y' in Lemma 3.20, we see that there is an isotopy of Fr(XF,W) onto Fr(XF',W). Outside of a small open collar C of ∂W, the isotopy we require from QV to QV' is identical to the isotopy described in the proof of Lemma 3.20. The only difference is that, during the sweepout stage, [formula] will be taken onto [formula] via an isotopy which leaves ∂QV fixed, as shown in Fig. ??

If the generalized Heegaard surface G  ⊂  M amalgamates to a minimal genus Heegaard surface of M, then g(M')  ≤  g(M) (here M' is the manifold obtained by gluing W to M2 as described in Convention 3.9).

Our strategy is to construct a surface Q  ⊂  W so that [formula] (see Convention 3.9) forms a generalized Heegaard surface of M', one which amalgamates to a Heegaard surface of at most the same genus as the Heegaard surface that G amalgamates to in M. This will yield the desired result.

Our assumption that T and G are well-configured does not eliminate the possibility that [formula]. But in this case T will be parallel to a component of G-, the thin part of G, which implies the stronger conclusion g(M1) + g(M2) = g(M). So we assume [formula].

Let V be a component of [formula] which meets T1, and let QV be its doppelgänger surface. By Lemma 3.22, for each component V' which is adjacent to V, there is exactly one component QV of QV which is isotopic to a component QV' of QV'. Since this isotopy fixes ∂QV, it may be extended to an ambient isotopy of W which fixes ∂W, and this ambient isotopy will push the remaining components of QV and the doppelgänger chamber U of V, into the complement of the doppelgänger chamber U' of V' in W, thereby allowing U' and the remaining components of QV' to be embedded in W without meeting the deformed copies of QV and U. Call this ambient isotopy a flipping isotopy. Since any flipping isotopy leaves ∂W fixed, every disk embedded in the original version of the doppelgänger U of V is deformed to a disk which meets h(AV) in the same way as the original. Thus the deformed copy of U still satisfies Observation 3.15 and Lemma 3.16.

Thus, by performing and reversing flipping isotopies across the components of QV, we may simultaneously embed deformed, but topologically equivalent, versions of the doppelgänger surfaces and chambers of every component of [formula] that is adjacent to V. This process of embedding can then be repeated for each of the components of [formula] that are adjacent to V, and then to the components of [formula] which are adjacent to the components of [formula] that are adjacent to V, and so on. This process will eventually terminate with the desired surface Q, and E(Q,W) will be the disjoint union of (harmlessly deformed versions of) the doppelgänger chambers of those components of [formula] which meet T1.

Observation 3.15 then implies that [formula] is a generalized compression body. Moreover, if E is the union of all the (deformed versions of) the disk sets EU defined in Lemma 3.16, then Lemma 3.16 implies that [formula] admits an ordering which makes it a primitive disk set for the ordered union of annuli [formula] (see Definition 1.4 and Convention 3.5) with respect to the map [formula] (see Convention 3.9). Thus, if we let [formula], and [formula] (here [formula] as in Observation 3.14), then by Proposition 1.6, V2' = V1' / f is also a generalized compression body. Moreover, [formula] (here [formula]) satisfies the requirements of Observation 1.2, hence V' = V2' / f' is also a generalized compression body. But if [formula], then V' = E(G',M'), so in fact G' is a generalized Heegaard splitting of M'. Moreover, since the doppelgänger surface Q was constructed from perfect spoke graphs as per Definition 3.18, the components of G' will all have exactly the same genus as the corresponding components of G. It follows that G' will amalgamate to a Heegaard surface of genus no higher than the surface which results from amalgamating G.

If G amalgamates to a minimal genus Heegaard surface of M, then g(M2)  ≤  g(M) + 1.

The Main Result

If K1 and K2 are knots in S3, then t(K1  #  K2)  ≥   max {t(K1),t(K2)}.

The proposition is trivial if one of K1 or K2 is the unknot, so suppose that both are non-trivial knots. Assume also that max {t(K1),t(K2)} = t(K2). Let T be the "swallow-follow" torus in E(K1  #  K2) which swallows the K2 summand and follows the K1 summand (see Figure 6). We apply Theorem 3.23 by setting M = E(K1  #  K2), noting that one component of E(T,M) is homeomorphic to E(K1), which will correspond to M1. What needs to be shown is that the untelescoped minimal splitting G can be isotoped so that it meets T only in essential simple closed curves, and such that each component of [formula] is separating.

By its definition as a swallow-follow torus, T is isotopic to [formula], where A is the decomposing annulus of the connected sum in M = E(K1  #  K2), and B the sub-annulus of ∂M - A which lies in the component of M - A corresponding to E(K1). By Proposition 1.21, G can be isotoped to intersect A only in essential simple closed curves, and since each boundary component of [formula] is then a standard meridional curve of ∂E(K1), every component of [formula] is separating in E(K1) (otherwise we could obtain a non-separating surface in S3). The hypotheses of Theorem 3.23 (which assume Conventions 3.1, 3.3, and 3.9) can then be satisfied by isotoping T sufficiently close to [formula].

Now M2 is the component of E(T,M) which is not homeomorphic to E(K1), but is instead homeomorphic to E(L), where L is the link in S3 which has K2 as one component, and a meridian μ of K2 as its other component, and T = ∂N(μ) under this correspondence (see Figure 6). Furthermore, the slope in which G has been made to intersect T = ∂N(μ) is the standard longitudinal slope determined by the meridian disk Δ  ⊂  S3 with ∂Δ  =  μ and [formula]. Thus the slope of the trivial Dehn filling of ∂N(μ) = T which yields E(K2) meets each component of [formula] exactly once, and Theorem 3.23 applies to M' = E(K2), yielding

[formula]

This proof also works if the knots K1 and K2 are embedded in homology spheres (or any pair of compact 3-manifolds in which every closed embedded surface is separating). In general, however, it is important to keep in mind the delicacy Theorem 3.23 (and Corollary 3.25), whose assumptions are encoded in Conventions 3.1, 3.3 and 3.9. In particular, the assumption of Convention 3.3 that T and G are well-configured cannot always be satisfied, as can be shown using straightforward examples in S1  ×  F, where F is a closed genus g > 1 surface. Thus Corollary 3.25 cannot be applied to prove the following plausible conjecture in the case g = 1 in any obvious way.

Suppose M is a compact 3-manifold and T is a separating, incompressible, orientable, genus g surface properly embedded in M. If M1 and M2 are the components of E(T,M), then g(M)  ≥   max {g(M1),g(M2)} - g.

Similarly, the need for T and G to be well-configured is what keeps us from applying Theorem 3.23 and Corollary 3.25 to prove the analogue of Theorem 4.1 for satellite knots.

Theorem 4.1 has some relation to the "rank-genus conjecture" for knot complements in S3. If we define r(K) to be the minimal number of generators for π1(S3 - K), then the rank-genus conjecture states:

For all knots K  ⊂  S3, r(K) = g(E(K,S3)) = t(K) + 1.

Since a genus g Heegaard splitting of a knot complement induces a g-generator presentation of π1(S3 - K), it is clear that r(K)  ≤  t(K) + 1, but it remains unknown whether it is possible for this inequality to be strict. The rank-genus conjecture for closed 3-manifolds is known to be false [\cite=boileau-zieschang], even when restricted to the class of hyperbolic 3-manifolds [\cite=li]. This suggests that the rank-genus conjecture also fails for knot complements, and a pair of knots in S3 whose tunnel number degenerated enough to violate Theorem 4.1 would have given a counterexample, since the following analogue of Theorem 4.1 for rank is trivial (thanks to Richard Weidmann for pointing out the simple line of proof below).

r(K1  #  K2)  ≥   max {r(K1),r(K2)} for any knots K1,K2  ⊂  S3.

π1(E(K1  #  K2)) is an amalgamated free product [formula] which retracts onto each of its factors.

The fact that Theorem 4.1 is true indicates that the class of knot pairs which experience high tunnel number degeneration is not a good place to look for counterexamples to the rank-genus conjecture after all. It might even be seen as a small vote in favor of the possibility that the rank-genus conjecture is valid for knot complements in S3.
