Noncoherent initial ideals in exterior algebras

Introduction

Let [formula] be an algebraically closed field of characteristic ≠  2. The exterior algebra [formula] of order n over [formula] consists of polynomials with coefficients from [formula] in noncommuting indeterminates [formula] subject to the relation xixj  =   - xjxi for 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  n. This relation implies x2i = 0 and that any monomial can be reordered up to a sign change into a canonical form [formula] where [formula]. Throughout, let [formula] denote [formula], where [formula]. Then [formula] is the set of monomials of [formula].

A term order [formula] on [formula] is a total order on [formula] which satisfies:

[formula] for all [formula] in [formula].

If [formula] then [formula] whenever [formula] and [formula] are both in [formula].

A term order [formula] on [formula] is coherent if there exists a weight vector [formula] such that [formula] whenever [formula], and noncoherent otherwise. Equivalently, a term order on [formula] is coherent if it can be extended to a term order on the monomials of the usual (commutative) polynomial algebra [formula]. When n  ≥  5, there exist noncoherent term orders on [formula]. In the interpretation of term orders on [formula] as comparative probability orders on subsets of an n-element set, this fact has long been known ([\cite=Kraft.Pratt.Seidenberg]).

Let [formula] mean that [formula] for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  N and [formula]. The following condition, when added to the defining conditions (i), (ii) of a term order on [formula], results in a set of conditions which are both necessary and sufficient for coherency:

For all N  ≥  2 and all [formula], if [formula] and [formula] for all i  <  N, then it is not the case that [formula].

The equivalent formulation of this condition in the setting of comparative probability orders can be found in, e.g., [\cite=Fishburn96]. Violation of (iii) for a certain N is called a failure of the Nth cancellation condition, denoted CN, and implies the order is noncoherent.

Let [formula] be a term order and let [formula], where [formula] and [formula]. Then the initial monomial [formula] of f is [formula] (where the maximum is taken with respect to [formula]), and the lead term [formula] of f is [formula]. Let [formula] be a left ideal. Then the initial ideal [formula] of I with respect to [formula] is the monomial ideal left-generated by [formula]. An initial ideal [formula] with respect to some noncoherent term order [formula] is a noncoherent initial ideal if [formula] for any coherent term order [formula]. We will work only with homogeneous ideals [formula]. These are in fact two-sided, so we may drop the word "left" from the discussion (see, e.g., [\cite=Stokes]).

In [\cite=Maclaganthesis], D. Maclagan posed the following question:

Does there exist a noncoherent initial ideal of an ideal I in the exterior algebra? That is, is there some initial ideal of I with respect to some noncoherent term order which is not equal to the initial ideal of I with respect to any coherent term order?

We give an affirmative answer to this question. For [formula], let [formula] denote the sum of the entries of [formula]. Let P denote the lattice of elements of {0,1}n, in which [formula] whenever [formula] (this is the same as ordering the subsets of an n-element set by inclusion). By an antichain in this lattice, we mean a set of pairwise incomparable elements.

Suppose [formula] is a noncoherent term order with a CN failure: [formula] and [formula] for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  N. If [formula] for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  N, and [formula] is an antichain in P, then the initial ideal [formula] of the (homogeneous) ideal

[formula]

is a noncoherent initial ideal.

It is not obvious that there exists an order [formula] satisfying the hypotheses of Theorem [\ref=theorem:main]. We exhibit an example of such an order, which was found using the MAGMA computer algebra system [\cite=MAGMA].

Let [formula] denote the following term order on the exterior algebra of order 6:

[formula]

(the remaining comparisons are determined since [formula] when [formula]).

The four boxed comparisons

[formula]

[formula]

are a failure of C4 satisfying the hypotheses of Theorem [\ref=theorem:main]. Let [formula]. Using the Gröbner basis algorithm of [\cite=Stokes], we compute

[formula]

It is actually easy to see that [formula] is noncoherent. By condition (iii), at least one of [formula] must appear in [formula] for any coherent term order [formula]. It is clear that none of these monomials are in [formula].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem:main]

For [formula], we say [formula] divides [formula] if [formula], and by [formula] we mean the monomial [formula]. By the least common multiple of [formula] and [formula], we mean [formula], where [formula] if [formula], and [formula] otherwise.

Fix a term order [formula] and let [formula]. Suppose [formula] for some [formula]. Following the notation of [\cite=Maclaganthesis], define the T-polynomial [formula] to be the polynomial

[formula]

Let mgi,gj be the least common multiple of [formula] and [formula]. Then the S-polynomial Sgi,gj is the polynomial

[formula]

where d1 = 1 if reordering [formula] into canonical form changes the sign of this monomial, d1 = 0 otherwise, and d2 is defined similarly.

Let [formula]. By reducing f with respect to G and [formula], we mean choosing some gi∈G such that [formula] divides [formula], letting [formula] (where d = 1 if reordering [formula] changes the sign of this monomial, d = 0 otherwise), and repeating this process with the new polynomial r until we obtain either zero or a polynomial whose initial monomial is not divisible by any [formula]. Call the resulting polynomial a remainder of f with respect to G and [formula]. This process is the same as the reduction algorithm found in [\cite=Stokes]. It also agrees (up to the sign ( - 1)d) with the usual reduction algorithm for elements of [formula] found in, for example, [\cite=Cox.Little.O'Shea].

Define a left Gröbner basis for a left ideal [formula] to be a set [formula] such that G left-generates I and [formula] left-generates [formula]. This condition is straightforwardly equivalent to requiring that [formula] reduces to 0 with respect to G and [formula] whenever f∈I. By [\cite=Stokes], this is equivalent to requiring that for any gi,gj∈G, all [formula] and all [formula] ([formula]) reduce to zero with respect to G and [formula]. Using this condition [\cite=Stokes] gives an algorithm, similar to Buchberger's algorithm, for extending a given generating set of I to a left Gröbner basis of I ([\cite=Stokes] calls this a Gröbner left ideal basis). The ideals we consider are homogeneous, so they are two-sided and we may drop the term "left".

Proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem:main]. If [formula] is a coherent term order, it must satisfy CN, so [formula] for some 1  ≤  i  ≤  N. This implies [formula]. It therefore suffices to show that no element of a generating set of [formula] divides any [formula]. To this end, we use the algorithm of [\cite=Stokes] to extend [formula] to a Gröbner basis [formula] of I with respect to [formula]. We will show the elements of [formula] involve monomials only of the form [formula] where [formula]. This will suffice since [formula] and by the antichain condition, none of [formula], [formula] (where [formula]) divide any [formula].

Let g∈H and [formula] with [formula]. Then [formula] and [formula] (possibly equal to zero). So the remainder on reducing [formula] with respect to H and remainders of other T-polynomials is either zero or also a monomial of this form. Any T-polynomial of a remainder of a T-polynomial is zero.

Let H' be the union of H and the set of nonzero remainders of T-polynomials. The S-polynomial of two elements of [formula] is zero. Let [formula]. By the antichain condition g2 does not divide [formula], so [formula] is either zero or a monomial of the form [formula] for some [formula]. This reduces similarly to the T-polynomials.

Let [formula]. Then Sg1,g2 has the form [formula] (one or both of these terms may be zero), where [formula]. By the antichain condition [formula] and [formula], so [formula] and [formula]. Thus reducing [formula] with respect to H' and nonzero remainders of other S-polynomials yields either 0, or a monomial or binomial with term(s) of the form [formula], where [formula]. The S-polynomial of any two such nonzero remainders, or such a nonzero remainder and an element of H', is either zero or a monomial or binomial with terms of the form [formula] for some [formula], and the product of [formula] and this S-polynomial reduces similarly.
