Abstract. Let p(n) denote the partition function. DeSalvo and Pak proved that [formula] for n  ≥  2, as conjectured by Chen. Moreover, they conjectured that a sharper inequality [formula] holds for n  ≥  45. In this paper, we prove the conjecture of Desalvo and Pak by giving an upper bound for -  Δ2 log p(n - 1), where Δ is the difference operator with respect to n. We also show that for given r  ≥  1 and sufficiently large n, ( - 1)r - 1Δr log p(n) > 0. This is analogous to the positivity of finite differences of the partition function. It was conjectured by Good and proved by Gupta that for given r  ≥  1, Δrp(n) > 0 for sufficiently large n.

Introduction

A partition of positive integer n is a nonincreasing sequence of positive integers [formula] such that [formula]. Let p(n) denote the number of partitions of n. In particular, we set p(0) = 1. The Hardy-Ramanujan-Rademacher formula for p(n) states that where Ak(n) is an arithmetic function, R2(n,N) is the remainder term and

[formula]

see, for example, Hardy and Ramanujan [\cite=hrsf], Rademacher [\cite=rade]. Note that A1(n) = 1 and A2(n) = ( - 1)n for n  ≥  1. Lehmer [\cite=lehmm] [\cite=lehm] gave the following error bound which is valid for all positive integers n and N.

Employing Rademacher's convergent series and Lehmer's error bound, DeSalvo and Pak [\cite=desp] proved the following inequality conjectured by Chen [\cite=chen3].

The above relation has been improved by DeSalvo and Pak [\cite=desp].

They also proposed the following conjecture.

For n  ≥  45, we have

[formula]

It should be mentioned that by using Lehmer's error bound for the remainder term of p(n), Bessenrodt and Ono [\cite=bo] proved the following inequality.

In this paper, we shall prove Conjecture [\ref=dp] by giving an upper bound for -  Δ2 log p(n - 1) for n  ≥  5000. Moreover, for any given r, we give an upper bound for ( - 1)r - 1Δr log p(n).

In 1977, Good [\cite=goodp] conjectured that Δrp(n) alternates in sign up to a certain value n = n(r), and then it stays positive. Using the Hardy-Rademacher series [\cite=rade1] for p(n), Gupta [\cite=gupta] proved that for any given r, Δrp(n) > 0 for sufficiently large n. In 1988, Odlyzko [\cite=amo] proved the conjecture of Good and obtained the following asymptotic formula for n(r): Knessl and Keller [\cite=kka1] [\cite=kka] obtained an approximation n(r)' for n(r) for which |n(r)' - n(r)|  ≤  2 up to r = 75. Almkvist [\cite=gadp1] [\cite=gadp] proved that n(r) satisfies certain equations.

By using the bounds of the modified Bessel function of the first kind, we shall prove that for any given r  ≥  1, there exists a positive integer n(r) such that ( - 1)r - 1Δr log p(n) > 0 for n  ≥  n(r).

Proof of Conjecture [\ref=dp]

In this section, we give a proof of Conjecture [\ref=dp] by using an inequality of DeSalvo and Pak [\cite=desp]. Let

[formula]

DeSalvo and Pak have shown that for n  ≥  50,

[formula]

We shall give an estimate of the right hand side of ([\ref=p22]), leading to a proof of the conjecture.

Proof of Conjecture [\ref=dp]. The conjecture can be restated as follows

[formula]

where n  ≥  45. We proceed to give an estimate of each term of the right hand side of ([\ref=p22]).

We begin with the first term of the right hand side of [\eqref=p22]. We claim that for n  ≥  50,

[formula]

For [formula], it can be easily checked that

[formula]

For n  ≥  50, we have [formula], and hence we can apply ([\ref=cpp2]) to deduce that

[formula]

For n  ≥  50, we have

[formula]

It follows that

[formula]

Combining ([\ref=hhh]) and ([\ref=dpak1]), we obtain ([\ref=cpp3]).

As for the second term of the right hand side of [\eqref=p22], it can be shown that for n > 50,

[formula]

To this end, we need the following inequality for [formula] and 0 < x  ≤  c < 1,

[formula]

Let

[formula]

For [formula] and 0  ≤  x  ≤  c < 1, we see that Since f(0) = 0, we obtain that f(x)  ≤  0 under the above assumption. This yields that f(x) < 0 for 0 < x  ≤  c < 1 and [formula], and hence ([\ref=gongs1]) is proved.

The left hand side of [\eqref=cpp5] can be rewritten as which can be simplified to

[formula]

Setting [formula], α = 2 and [formula], for n  ≥  50, we have 0 < x < c < 1 and [formula]. By ([\ref=gongs1]), we find that for n  ≥  50,

[formula]

Setting [formula], α = 2 and [formula], for n  ≥  50, we also have 0 < x < c < 1 and [formula]. Again, using ([\ref=gongs1]), we see that for n  ≥  50,

[formula]

Combining [\eqref=dpak4] and [\eqref=dpak5], we deduce that for n  ≥  50,

[formula]

Setting [formula], [formula] and [formula], for n  ≥  50, we have 0 < x < c < 1 and [formula]. Applying ([\ref=gongs1]), for n  ≥  50, we get

[formula]

Combining [\eqref=dpak6] and [\eqref=dpak7], we find that for n  ≥  50,

[formula]

The right hand side of [\eqref=dpak8] can be expanded as follows

[formula]

Clearly, for [formula] and n  ≥  50, which implies that for n  ≥  50,

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Applying [\eqref=examgp1], [\eqref=examgp2] and [\eqref=examgp3] to the last four terms of [\eqref=gcpp1], we obtain that for n  ≥  50,

[formula]

For the second term of [\eqref=dpak3]. Setting [formula], α = 1 and [formula], for n  ≥  50, we have 0 < x < c < 1 and [formula]. By ([\ref=gongs1]), we see that for n  ≥  50,

[formula]

Using [\eqref=dpaks5] and the same argument as in the derivation of [\eqref=22s1], it can be shown that for n  ≥  50,

[formula]

In view of ([\ref=22s1]) and ([\ref=22s2]), we arrive at [\eqref=cpp5].

To estimate the third term of the right hand side of [\eqref=p22], we aim to show that for n  ≥  50,

[formula]

It's easily verified that for α  ≥  1 / 2 and [formula],

[formula]

So for n  ≥  50, we have

[formula]

Consequently, for n  ≥  50,

Utilizing the above upper bounds [\eqref=cpp3], [\eqref=cpp5] and [\eqref=cpp4] for the three terms of the right hand side of ([\ref=p22]), we conclude that for n  ≥  50,

Next we show that for n  ≥  5000,

[formula]

Clearly, for n  ≥  100,

[formula]

To prove that for n  ≥  5000,

[formula]

let

[formula]

The equation g(x) = 0 has two solutions

[formula]

where W0(z) and W- 1(z) are two branches of Lambert W function W(z), see Corless, Gonnet, Hare, Jeffrey and Knuth [\cite=lwfk]. More explicitly, we have x1  ≈  0.64, x2  ≈  4996.47. It can be checked that g(5000) < 0. Thus for x  ≥  5000,

[formula]

This proves [\eqref=cwfc1]. Hence ([\ref=cwfcc2]) holds.

Using ([\ref=cwfcc2]), it can be shown that ([\ref=cpp1]) holds for n  ≥  5000. It is easily verified that for x > 0,

[formula]

Let For x  ≥  0, we see that Since h(0) = 0, we have h(x) > 0 for x > 0. Combining ([\ref=cwfcc2]) and ([\ref=cwfcc3]), we conclude that for n  ≥  5000, DeSalvo and Pak [\cite=desp] have verified the above relation for 45  ≤  n  ≤  8000. Thus ([\ref=cpp1]) holds for n  ≥  45 and the proof is completed.

An upper bound for ( - 1)r - 1Δr log p(n)

The conjecture of DeSalvo and Pak can be formulated as an upper bound for 2 log p(n) -  log p(n - 1) -  log p(n + 1), namely, for n  ≥  45,

[formula]

where Δ is the difference operator as given by Δf(n) = f(n + 1) - f(n).

In this section, we give an upper bound for ( - 1)r - 1Δr log p(n). When r = 2, this upper bound reduces to the above relation ([\ref=betcpp1]). In the following theorem, we adopt the notation (a)k for the rising factorial, namely, (a)0 = 1 and [formula] for k  ≥  1.

In the proof of the above theorem, we shall use Hardy-Ramanujan-Rademacher series for n  ≥  1,

[formula]

and the following estimate for Ak(n),

[formula]

see Rademacher [\cite=rade1]. In particular, we have A1(n) = 1 and A2(n) = ( - 1)n. The function Lν(x) in ([\ref=hrs3]) is defined by

[formula]

where Γ(m + ν + 1) is the Gamma function.

With the notation of μ(n) as in ([\ref=mumuref1]), we have

[formula]

and so [\eqref=hrs3] can be rewritten as

[formula]

Denote the kth summand in [\eqref=ccphrs3] by fk(n), namely,

[formula]

Writing [\eqref=ccphrs3] as

[formula]

It is known that see Abramowitz and Stegun [\cite=ahand] or Almkvist [\cite=gadp1]. Since A1(n) = 1, f1(n) can be expressed as

[formula]

Recall A2(n) = ( - 1)n, by [\eqref=deflnux1] and [\eqref=askm1] we obtain that for n  ≥  1, Clearly, [formula] for m  ≥  0. Hence for n  ≥  1,

[formula]

which implies that for n  ≥  1, f1(n) is positive and It is also clear that, for n  ≥  1, both of μ(n) - 1 and [formula] are positive. Applying ([\ref=ccphrs4]) to [\eqref=ccpheq3], we obtain that for n  ≥  1

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

where

[formula]

Let

[formula]

To estimate ( - 1)r - 1Δr log p(n), we shall give upper bounds for Hr and Gr. We first consider Gr.

To prove Theorem [\ref=estg], we recall a monotone property of the ratio of two power series, see Ponnusamy and Vuorinen [\cite=pv1]. We also need a lower bound and an upper bound on the ratio of Lν(x) and Lν(y), which can be deduced from known bounds on the ratio of two modified Bessel functions of the first kind.

Suppose that the power series both converge for |x| <   ∞   and βm > 0 for all m > 0. Then the function [formula] is strictly decreasing for x > 0 if the sequence {αm  /  βm}∞m = 0 is strictly decreasing.

Let Iν(x) be the modified Bessel function of the first kind as given by see Watson [\cite=watson1]. It is known that for ν  ≥  1 / 2 and 0 < x < y, Iν(x) increases with x and see Baricz [\cite=bondli]. For x > 0, from [\eqref=deflnux1] we see that Lν(x) can be expressed by Iν(x), Thus the above properties of Iν(x) can be restated in terms of Lν(x).

For ν  ≥  1 / 2 and 0 < x < y, we have

We are now ready to prove Theorem [\ref=estg].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=estg]. Since |Gr|  ≤  |F1| + |F2| + |F3|, in order to estimate Gr, we shall estimate |F1|, |F2| and |F3|. It follows from [\eqref=amr2] that

[formula]

which yields that

[formula]

where ζ(x) is the Riemann zeta function. For convenience, we denote by g(n) the right hand side of the above inequality, so that [\eqref=loghrs4] becomes

[formula]

To estimate F1, F2 and F3, we shall make use of the monotonicity of [formula], [formula] and [formula]. It is easily seen that [formula] decreases with n for n  ≥  1, since [formula] decreases with y for y > 0 and μ(n) increases with n. By [\eqref=askm1], we have The ratio of coefficients of xm in L3 / 2(μ2(n) / 16) and L3 / 2(μ2(n) / 4) is [formula]. By Proposition [\ref=logpvm], we see that [formula] decreases with y for y > 0. Notice that μ2(x) increases with x for x  ≥  1. So [formula] decreases with x for x  ≥  1. This implies that [formula] decreases with n.

Next we prove the monotonicity of [formula]. Recall that The ratio of coefficients of xm in L3 / 2(y / 36) and L3 / 2(y / 4) - 2- 5 / 2L3 / 2(y / 16) equals

[formula]

which decreases with m for m  ≥  0. By Proposition [\ref=logpvm], we deduce that for y > 0, decreases with y. Hence [formula] decreases with n for n  ≥  1.

Using the above monotone properties, we proceed to derive upper bounds for |F1|, |F2| and |F3|. It is known that for 0 < x < 1,

[formula]

[formula]

see also DeSalvo and Pak [\cite=desp].

We first estimate F1. Since

[formula]

we have It follows that

[formula]

By the monotonicity of [formula], we see that for n  ≥  1 and 0  ≤  k  ≤  r,

[formula]

Applying [\eqref=f1d1a2] to [\eqref=f1d1a1], we find that for n  ≥  1, Since log (1 + x)  ≤  x for x  ≥  0, we see that for n  ≥  1,

[formula]

To estimate F2, we begin with the following expression

[formula]

It follows from [\eqref=geq0] that

[formula]

Using [\eqref=loglogeq2], we find that for n  ≥  1,

[formula]

Combining ([\ref=f2f2geq1]) and ([\ref=f2f2geq2]), we obtain that for n  ≥  1, Using the monotonicity of [formula], we see that for n  ≥  1, Hence, by [\eqref=loglogeq1], we obtain that for n  ≥  1,

[formula]

To estimate F3, we use the following expression

[formula]

By Proposition [\ref=logpropb1], we find that for n  ≥  1

[formula]

and

[formula]

Consequently, for n  ≥  1,

[formula]

For n  ≥  50, it can be checked that

[formula]

Combining [\eqref=f1f4a3] and [\eqref=f1f4a4], we obtain that for n  ≥  50, or equivalently,

[formula]

Combining [\eqref=loghrs5] and [\eqref=f1f4a5], we see that for n  ≥  50, which can be rewritten as Thus, we can use [\eqref=loglogeq2] to deduce that for n  ≥  50,

[formula]

Since -   log (1 - x) is increasing for x >  - 1, according to [\eqref=loghrs5] and [\eqref=f1f4a7], we deduce that for n  ≥  50,

[formula]

Combining [\eqref=f1f4a7] and [\eqref=f1f4a8], we see that for n  ≥  50,

[formula]

It follows from ([\ref=f33est1]) and ([\ref=f1f4a9]) that for n  ≥  50, Based on the monotonicity of [formula], we find that for n  ≥  50, Hence, by [\eqref=loglogeq1], we obtain that for n  ≥  50,

[formula]

By Proposition [\ref=logpropb1], we see that for n  ≥  1

[formula]

In view of [\eqref=usef1] and [\eqref=f1f4a1], we obtain that for n  ≥  50,

[formula]

where F4 is defined by As a consequence of [\eqref=usef2] and [\eqref=f1f4a1], it can be checked that for n  ≥  50,

[formula]

Applying [\eqref=f1f4a1], [\eqref=f1f4a2] and [\eqref=gf1f4a3] to [\eqref=usef3], we obtain that for n  ≥  50,

[formula]

Combining [\eqref=estg1f1], [\eqref=estg1f2] and [\eqref=estg1f3], we conclude that for n  ≥  50,

[formula]

It follows from [\eqref=f1f4a1] that for n  ≥  1,

[formula]

Thus ([\ref=estgron1]) and ([\ref=estgron2]) lead to an upper bound for |F1| + |F2| + |F3|. This completes the proof.

To prove Theorem [\ref=dprm1], we still need to estimate Hr and we shall use two relations due to Odlyzko [\cite=amo] on the relations between the higher order differences and derivatives.

Let r be a positive integer. Suppose that f(x) is a function with infinite continuous derivatives for x  ≥  1, and ( - 1)k - 1f(k)(x) > 0 for k  ≥  1. Then for r > 1,

Proof of Theorem [\ref=dprm1]. First, we treat the case r = 1, which states that for n  ≥  12,

[formula]

Since we have estimated |Gr|, we only need to estimate Hr for r = 1. By Proposition [\ref=abc], we have

[formula]

We claim that for n  ≥  50,

[formula]

We proceed to estimate each term of the right hand side of [\eqref=h1h1f1]. For the first term, we need to show that for n  ≥  50,

[formula]

Setting [formula], α = 1 / 2 and [formula], for n  ≥  50, we have 0 < x < c < 1 and [formula]. It follows from ([\ref=gongs1]) that for n  ≥  50,

[formula]

This proves [\eqref=h1h1f2].

For the second term of the right hand side of [\eqref=h1h1f1], for n  ≥  50, we have

[formula]

For the last term of the right hand side of [\eqref=h1h1f1], using the same argument as in the derivation of [\eqref=22s1], we obtain that for n  ≥  50,

[formula]

Combining [\eqref=h1h1f2], [\eqref=h1h1f3] and [\eqref=h1h1f4], we obtain [\eqref=gh1h1f1].

By the estimate of H1 in [\eqref=gh1h1f1] and the estimate of G1 in [\eqref=gestmm1], we obtain that for n  ≥  50, Notice that for n  ≥  200, and for n  ≥  50, Hence, for n  ≥  200,

[formula]

Moreover, it can be easily checked that for x > 0,

[formula]

Thus, for n  ≥  1,

[formula]

Combining the above relation and ([\ref=ggh1ga1]), we reach [\eqref=th1h1] for n  ≥  200.

It can be checked that [\eqref=th1h1] is valid for 12  ≤  n  ≤  200, and so Theorem [\ref=dprm1] holds for r = 1.

We now turn to the case [formula]. We proceed to show that there exists an integer n(r) such that for n  ≥  n(r),

[formula]

where Since x(1 - x) <  log (1 + x) for x > 0, we have that for n  ≥  1, Thus [\eqref=drum0] implies Theorem [\ref=dprm1] for r  ≥  2.

By [\eqref=loghrs2], we see that for n  ≥  1, To prove [\eqref=drum0], it suffices to show that for n  ≥  n(r)

[formula]

Since Theorem [\ref=estg] gives the upper bound for |Gr|, we need an upper bound for Hr. Recall that for n  ≥  1,

[formula]

For [formula], write

[formula]

By exchanging the order of two summations with one being finite, it can be seen that for x  ≥  1,

[formula]

Hence [\eqref=husum1] implies that for n  ≥  1, The rth derivatives of [formula] and μ(x)- k are given as follows,

[formula]

Therefore, the functions [formula] and -  μ(x)- k satisfy the conditions of Proposition [\ref=abc] for r  ≥  1 and k  ≥  1. Hence,

[formula]

Rewrite the right hand side of [\eqref=upbnd1] as

[formula]

To bound the first term of [\eqref=upbnd2], we claim that for n  ≥  48r - 3,

[formula]

where Setting [formula], α = r - 1 / 2 and [formula], for n  ≥  48r - 3, we have 0 < x < c < 1 and [formula]. Invoking ([\ref=gongs1]), we find that for n  ≥  48r - 3, This yields that for n  ≥  48r - 3,

[formula]

It is easily seen that for n  ≥  48r - 3, So we arrive at [\eqref=ansupbnd1].

As for the second term of [\eqref=upbnd2], it can be shown that for n  ≥  48r - 3,

[formula]

or equivalently,

[formula]

This can be easily justified since for 0  ≤  x < 1, r  ≥  2 and n  ≥  48r - 3,

[formula]

To estimate the last term of [\eqref=upbnd2], we aim to show that for n  ≥  48r - 3,

[formula]

where

[formula]

Note that for given r, a2 and a3 are convergent. Setting [formula], α = k / 2 + r and [formula], for n  ≥  48r - 3, we have 0 < x < c < 1 and [formula]. By ([\ref=gongs1]), we find that for n  ≥  48r - 3,

[formula]

Clearly, for n  ≥  48r - 3 and k  ≥  1,

[formula]

Thus, [\eqref=ansupbnd3] follows from [\eqref=dpakhrg2], [\eqref=complexa1] and [\eqref=complexa2].

Combining [\eqref=ansupbnd1], [\eqref=ansupbnd2] and [\eqref=ansupbnd3], we obtain that for n  ≥  48r - 3, Let

[formula]

Notice that for given r ,a1 is a finite number and a2 + a3 is convergent, so a1 + a2 + a3 is a number for given r. It can be verified that for n  ≥  u1 + 1, Thus, for n  ≥   max {48r - 3,u1 + 1}, Using the above inequality and [\eqref=gestmm1], we deduce that for n  ≥   max {50,48r - 3,u1 + 1}, Observe that for n  ≥  1, It follows that for n  ≥   max {50,48r - 3,u1 + 1},

[formula]

To deduce ([\ref=drumm1]) from [\eqref=xyz1], we consider the following equation

[formula]

Keep in mind that μ(x) is defined for x  ≥  1 / 24. We claim that equation [\eqref=expu1] has two real roots. Recall that the Lambert W function W(z) is defined to be a function satisfying

[formula]

for any complex number z, see Corless, Gonnet, Hare, Jeffrey and Knuth [\cite=lwfk]. So a solution of ([\ref=expu1]) has the following form It is known that W(z) is a multi-valued function. In particular, W(z) has two real values W0(z) and W- 1(z) for [formula]. Using the following inequality, see Abramowitz and Stegun [\cite=ahand],

[formula]

we see that for r  ≥  2, Hence [\eqref=expu1] has two real roots. Let u2 be the larger real root. Clearly, for sufficient large x, It follows that for n  ≥  u2 + 1,

[formula]

Combining [\eqref=xyz1] and [\eqref=exepu1], we conclude that [\eqref=drumm1] holds for n  ≥  n(r), where

[formula]

This completes the proof for the case r  ≥  2.

The positivity of ( - 1)r - 1Δr log p(n)

In this section, we prove the positivity of ( - 1)r - 1Δr log p(n) for r  ≥  1 and sufficiently large n. This is analogous to the positivity of the differences of the partition function conjectured by Good [\cite=goodp] and proved by Gupta. The proof relies on the estimates of Hr and Gr in the previous section.

Proof. The case r = 1 is obvious since p(n + 1) > p(n) for n  ≥  1. For r = 2, DeSalvo and Pak [\cite=desp] have shown that sequence p(n) is log-concave for n > 25, or equivalently, for n  ≥  25, We now consider the case r  ≥  3. Recall that where Hr and Gr are given in ([\ref=loghrs2])and ([\ref=geq0loghrs2]). Hence, we see that for r  ≥  1,

[formula]

An upper bound for |Gr| has been given in Theorem [\ref=estg], so we only need a lower bound for Hr. By Proposition [\ref=abc], we find that

[formula]

The first term of the right hand side of ([\ref=geqff1]) has the following lower bound for r  ≥  48r - 2,

[formula]

where

[formula]

Setting [formula] and α = r - 1 / 2, for n  ≥  48r - 2, we have 0 < x < 1 and [formula]. It follows from ([\ref=posalpha1]) that for n  ≥  48r - 2, or equivalently, Observing that for n  ≥  48r - 2, we obtain [\eqref=geq0fir1] for n  ≥  48r - 2.

For the second term of the right hand side of [\eqref=geqff1], we claim that for n  ≥  48r - 2,

[formula]

where Setting [formula], α = r and [formula], for n  ≥  48r - 2, we have 0 < x < c < 1 and [formula]. By ([\ref=gongs1]), we see that for n  ≥  48r - 2, So we obtain [\eqref=geq0fir2] for n  ≥  48r - 2.

Since the last term of the right hand side of [\eqref=geqff1] is positive, combining [\eqref=geq0fir1] and [\eqref=geq0fir2], we deduce that for n  ≥  48r - 2,

[formula]

To derive a simpler expression for a lower bound of Hr, let

[formula]

Then we have that for n  ≥  m1 + 1, It follows that for n  ≥   max {48r - 2,m1 + 1},

[formula]

By [\eqref=dprme1] and [\eqref=dprme4], we find that for n  ≥   max {50,48r - 2,m1 + 1},

[formula]

Notice that for r  ≥  1 and n  ≥  1, Thus, for n  ≥   max {50,48r - 2,m1 + 1},

[formula]

To prove that the right hand side of [\eqref=geq0dprme5] is positive for sufficiently large n, consider the following equation

[formula]

The solution of [\eqref=expx1] can be expressed in terms of the Lambert W function, namely,

[formula]

For r  ≥  1, we have [formula]. Using the estimate of r! as given by [\eqref=estimatefac], we obtain that for r  ≥  3, Thus [\eqref=expx1] has two real roots. Let m2 be the larger real root of equation [\eqref=expx1]. Clearly, for sufficiently large x,

[formula]

It follows that for n  ≥  m2 + 1,

[formula]

Let

[formula]

Combining [\eqref=dprme5] and [\eqref=expx2], we conclude that for n  ≥  n(r),
