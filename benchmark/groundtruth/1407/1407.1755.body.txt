Hierarchical stratification of Pareto sets

Introduction

Multiobjective optimization (MO) deals with the problem of optimizing several functions at once.

Let [formula], [formula], x,y∈W. x dominates y if fi(x)  ≥  fi(y), for all i and fj(x) > fj(y) for at least one j. If there does not exist any point y∈W dominating x, then x is called a Pareto optimum.

The first important difference with single function optimization is that the set of optima is composed by a unique point only in degenerate cases: usually, even with only two functions, the set of optima consists in an uncountable set of points. The set of all such generalized optima is called the set of Pareto optima. If there exists a neighborhood of p in W where p is Pareto optimal, then p is called a local Pareto optimum. The set of local Pareto optima is denoted by θop.

In most practical cases the goal of MO is to produce a unique solution coping with the several requirements represented by the objective functions, however, the choice of the preferred solution is always the outcome of a compromise involving non universal criteria.

Being in principle all the possible optimal solutions equivalent, it seems worth to obtain the most precise and complete information on them before passing to the decision stage. Such a complete representation of the Pareto optimal set assumes a special meaning in the point of view of global optimization.

Furthermore, when a parametric optimization problem can be defined as, e.g., a weighted sum or a more general non linear combination of a number of functions, the optimal solution varies as the parameters vary, spanning a portion of the Pareto set of the MO problem defined by the family of functions. These problems are of particular interest, because a single optimal design should not be selected among the others, but in some sense the whole family of solutions has to be implemented. We will discuss an example in biology of such applications in section [\ref=sec:evolution], but more examples has emerged also recently in completely different research areas, e.g., materials science [\cite=Lejaeghere:2013kx] [\cite=Truskinovsky:1996hf].

Our goal is to describe the geometrical organization of the set of Pareto optima one is expected to find in the generic smooth but nonlinear and non convex MO problem. We will see that in the general case of an MO problem with m objective functions, the set of local Pareto optima θop will consist in a manifold with boundary and corners of dimension m - 1, i.e., a geometrical object called a stratified set in the sense of Mather [\cite=Mather:1973fk] [\cite=Mather:2012gp]. As will be described in the examples of section [\ref=sec:evolution], the components (strata) of dimension k - 1 in the Pareto set are related to the subproblems of k objective functions. Such strata play a special role in the optimization process and are fundamental ingredients to decrypt the problem structure when the objective functions themselves are unknown and need to be investigated in order to reveal, in the Darwinian evolution example of section [\ref=sec:evolution], how nature works.

Motivation: Darwinian evolution

The guiding principle in the Darwinian theory of evolution is often resumed as the "survival of the fittest". This is often viewed as an optimization principle, suggesting the existence of a hidden fitness function which the living beings are aimed to maximize. The problem comes when the function itself becomes the focus of the interest, because its definition resists to be ultimately discovered. J Indeed, sooner or later one is faced with involutive statements like "the fitness is the function which is maximized by the surviving individuals". As an extremization of this paradox, [\cite=Thurner:2010hk] proposes a model of evolution reproducing many phenomena observable in nature without having resort to the introduction of a fitness function.

Indeed, the large variety of species and even of individuals in the same species, raises serious arguments against the definition of a unique and immutable optimization process followed by evolution. As we have already observed, this multiplicity of solutions is not a problem in multiobjective optimization, but it is rather one of its fingerprints. Recently [\cite=Shoval:2012ke] [\cite=Noor:2012hg] [\cite=Schuetz:2012io], it has been proposed that evolution could be driven by multiple objectives. More precisely, one could think that an individual, or a species, is characterized by a vector of traits [formula], i.e., quantitative measures like beak length, body size, area proportions of molar teeth, resuming its phenotype. The space of traits to which v belongs is called the morphospace. Then one assumes that the fitness function F is a monotonically increasing function of a number of performance functions [formula], fi(v) representing how well a specific task i is performed by a organism with phenotype v. When the performance function fi has a single optimum vi, this is referred to as the archetype for fi. It is reasonable that the comprehensive fitness function F depends monotonically on the performances fi, however, the different contributions of these performances can vary over time or geographical space or because of interaction with other species. Therefore all phenotypes belonging to the Pareto set of the MO problem defined by [formula] have the chance to be selected by evolution and be observed in wildlife.

A hierarchical decomposition of the local Pareto set in the general convex case

Let [formula] open and convex. Let [formula], [formula], m  ≤  n, be smooth and convex functions. Then the Pareto set is a curved m - 1 simplex, i.e., is diffeomorphic to an m - 1 dimensional simplex, i.e., the convex hull of a set of m points in general position in [formula]. Each one of the vertices of the curved m - 1 simplex coincide with one of the optima of the m functions taken separately. Every k - 1 facet of the curved simplex corresponds to the Pareto optimal set of the MO problem defined by a subset of k functions in [formula].

In the case that all the functions are spherically symmetric the Pareto set is exactly an m - 1 simplex, i.e., the facets are flat.

This proposition is presented and discussed graphically in [\cite=Shoval:2012ke]. An alternative proof follows straightforwardly from the characterization of the Pareto set in terms of first and second order derivatives by Smale [\cite=Smale:1973km] (see also [\cite=Lovison:2013uq] [\cite=Lovison:2011uq] [\cite=Smale:1975oy] [\cite=Wan:1977yi] [\cite=Wan:1975lt]).

Darwinian evolution with multiobjective fitness

In [\cite=Shoval:2012ke], the authors explore the variety in morphospace of a number of family of species, and by recognizing shapes assimilable to simplexes in the set of wild species. See for instance the beak sizes and shapes for the Darwin's ground finches, leaf-cutter ants and microchiroptera (Figure [\ref=fig:triangles_in_evo]). Even at the level of convex functions, the idea of the hierarchical decomposition of the Pareto set offers multiple advantages at least at two different levels. First of all, at epistemic level, the inspection of the Pareto set allows to detect the archetypes and therefore to decrypt the unknown objective functions. If this is the underlying principle of selection, the detection of the Pareto set and of the archetypes allows for a decryption of the structure of the multiobjective fitness function, revealing eventually the workings of the evolution mechanism, avoiding tautological loops. Secondly, at numerical level, we have that solving the ordinary single objective functions one can detect the archetypes and then can obtain a zero-th order approximation of the Pareto set consisting simply in tracing the convex hull of the set of archetypes. The approximation of the Pareto set with a simplex is exact when the objectives have rotational symmetry (e.g., quadratic forms with a unique eigenvalue). The simplex start to exhibit curvature as the objective functions depart from the spherical symmetry. It is however worth noting that in the convex case we could obtain an essentially faithful approximation of the whole Pareto set simply solving m single objective optimization problems and building their convex hull.

Stratification of the Pareto set and sufficient regularity of objective functions

In the convex case the Pareto set is diffeomorphic to an (m - 1) dimensional simplex, in the non convex case the situation can be much more complicated, analogously to what happens for the single objective case, where because of non convexity multiextremality and non maximal critical points arise.

Nevertheless, in non pathological situations, the set of local Pareto optima appears still intelligible. Its geometrical structure can be analyzed and classifiable as an (m - 1) dimensional stratified set. Heuristically, a stratified set is a manifold with borders and corners, i.e., an (m - 1) manifold whose frontier is composed by manifolds of lower dimension with "nice" intersections.

This section is rather technical and is dedicated to a precise specification of what we mean by "nice intersection", "stratification" and "non pathological", where we revisit in a unitary form the results in [\cite=Melo:1976sj] [\cite=Melo:1976xd] [\cite=Wan:1977yi] [\cite=Wan:1978jy]. Because of lacking of space we cannot give a self contained introduction on the singularities of differentiable mappings. The reader is referred to [\cite=Arnold:1968fx] [\cite=Golubitsky:1973uj].

There is also another allied concept which is necessary during the discussion, the Pareto criticality [\cite=Smale:1973km].

Let [formula] be smooth. Let Pos be the positive orthant of [formula], i.e., [formula]. A point p is said Pareto critical if [formula].

As it happens with ordinary scalar functions, criticality becomes important as we relax the assumption of convexity, because not only maxima have zero derivative but also critical points of different nature arise, as minima or saddles. The condition mentioned is still important because it is a necessary condition for optimality and is a condition involving only first order derivatives.

Semialgebraic sets

[formula] is said to be semialgebraic if and only if it can be defined as a finite union of sets Kj, each being defined by a finite set of polynomial equations and inequalities. In other words:

[formula]

(where fi,j and gh,j are polynomial functions.)

The closure of a semialgebraic set C, denoted by [formula], is defined by converting all the strict inequalities in the definition of C to weak inequalities. [formula] is still semialgebraic.

A subset of [formula] is semialgebraic if and only if it is in the smallest family of subsets of [formula] closed under finite union, finite intersection and complements and which contains sets of the form [formula], where g is a polynomial in m variables with real coefficients.

See Seidenberg [\cite=Seidenberg1954].

The image of a semialgebraic subset in [formula] under a polynomial mapping from [formula] into [formula] is a semialgebraic subset in [formula].

See Seidenberg [\cite=Seidenberg1954].

rth order conditions

The r-jet of a smooth (C∞) function [formula] with source in x0 and target in f(x0), is the equivalence class of the Taylor expansion of the function f in x0, arrested at the degree r. The r-jet of f at x0 is denoted by jrf(x0) and can be identified with the Taylor expansion of f:

[formula]

This definition can be generalized naturally to the mappings between euclidean spaces. Let Jr(n,m) be the space of r-jets from [formula] to [formula], with source and target in 0:

[formula]

This space is called Jet Bundle and we have that Jr(n,m) is a vector space and that there exists a linear isomorphism given by

[formula]

where Brn,m is the vector space of polynomial mappings from [formula] to [formula] with deg ≤  r.

A subset C  ⊂  Jr(n,m) is called a rth-order condition provided the set C is invariant under the group of Cr diffeomorphisms around [formula]. Moreover, if the set C is semialgebraic we say that it is a rth-order algebraic condition.

Now we generalize the definition of Jet Bundle to smooth manifolds, for further details and proofs the reader is referred to [\cite=Golubitsky:1973uj].

Let X,Y be smooth manifolds, p∈X and r > 1. Let f,g:X  →  Y be Cμ (μ  >  r) mappings such that f(p) = g(p) = q.

f  ~  1g at p [formula] df(p) = dg(p) as linear mappings TpX  →  TqY.

f  ~  rg at p [formula] df(p)  ~  r - 1dg(p) at every point of TpX.

Let Jr(X,Y)p,q be the set of the equivalence classes under the relation "~  r at p" of mappings f:X  →  Y, with f(p) = q.

Set [formula]. An element z∈Jr(X,Y) is called r-jet.

Let z be a r-jet. Then there exist p∈X and q∈Y such that z∈Jr(X,Y)p,q : p is called source of z and q is called target of z.

Note that given f:X  →  Y is defined canonically the mapping

[formula]

Let [formula] be an open set, p∈U. Let [formula] be smooth mappings. Then

[formula]

[formula] are such that f  ~  rg at p ⇔   the Taylor expansions of f and g up to order r are identical at p.

Let X,Y be smooth manifolds of dimension n and m respectively. Then Jr(X,Y) is a fiber bundle over X  ×  Y with fiber Brn,m.

Let W be a Cμ (μ > r) compact manifold without boundary of dimension n. We have that [formula] is a vector bundle with fiber [formula]. If A  ⊂  Jr(n,m) is a rth-order algebraic condition, then we can define a semialgebraic subbundle of the vector bundle [formula]: is the subbundle with fiber A and we will denote it with [formula].

A Cμ map [formula] is said to satisfy a rth-order algebraic condition A (μ  >  r) if [formula].

An r-th algebraic condition is generic if is satisfied by a residual subset of [formula].

Stratifications

Roughly speaking, a stratification of a set A is a partition of A into manifolds fitting togheter regularly. Now we give a precise mathematical definition for two submanifold of Rn to have "nice" intersections, it is based on the idea that if we have two submanifold X and Y with Y  ⊂  Cl(X), then irregularity of their intersection at a point y∈Y corresponds to the existence on nonunique limit of tangent planes TxX as x approches to y. For further details the reader is referred to Mather [\cite=Mather:1973fk] [\cite=Mather:2012gp]. Let X,Y be Cμ submanifolds of [formula].

We say that the pair (X,Y) satisfies Whitney's condition b at y if for each sequence [formula] and each sequence [formula], both converging to y∈Y, such that the sequence of secant lines [formula] converges to some line [formula] (in the projective space [formula]) and the sequence [formula] converges to some plane [formula], we have that l  ⊂  τ.

Let W be a Cμ manifold without boundary and A be a subset of W.

A stratification S of A is a cover of A by pairwise disjoint submanifolds of W which lie in A. The elements of S are called strata. S is said locally finite if each point in A has a neighborhood which meets only a finite number of strata. S satisfies the condition of the frontier if for each stratum σ of S, [formula] is a union of strata in S.

A stratification S of A is said a Whitney stratification if it is locally finite, it satisfies the condition of the frontier and if (σ,ρ) satisfies Whitney's condition b for any pair (σ,ρ) of strata of S.

Let X,Y be Cr manifolds and A  ⊂  Y closed set with a Whitney stratification S. Let f:X  →  Y be a Cμ map transversal to S (with μ  >  r + 1). Define

[formula]

Then [formula] is a Whitney stratification of f- 1(A).

See Mather [\cite=Mather:2012gp].

Stratifications of semialgebraic sets

Consider a semialgebraic set C  ⊂  Jp(n,m), as we said above :

[formula]

(where fi,j and gh,j are polynomial functions.) Every semialgebraic set admits a Whitney's stratification (see Mather [\cite=Mather:1973fk]), whose strata are submanifolds determined by the polynomial inequalities defining the set. We denote with S0 this Whitney's stratification. The closure [formula] is still semialgebraic, is defined by converting all the strict inequalities in the definition of C in weak inequalities. Thus also [formula] is stratified: the strata are defined by the polynomial inequalities, we call this last stratification [formula]. Note that S0  ⊂   but this second one is not merely the topological closure of the first: [formula] contains the strata of S0 and other strata in addition, which appear by converting each strict inequality to a weak inequality. Hence C is a Whitney's substratified subset of [formula], i.e., is union of strata of [formula]. Now assume that C  ⊂  Jr(n,m) is a r-th order algebraic condition and let let W be a Cμ compact manifold without boundary of dimension n. Then we can define [formula], semialgebraic subbundle of [formula] with fiber C. Note that [formula] is not a smooth subbundle, since C is not a smooth submanifold, but it is a stratified set: S0 induces a Whitney stratification S on [formula]. Moreover denote with [formula] the semialgebraic subbundle with fiber [formula] (note that this is not the topological closure of [formula]). Then [formula] induces a Whintey's stratification [formula] on [formula]. Finally we have that S  ⊂  , i.e. [formula] is a substratified subset of [formula].

Algebraic conditions for Pareto optimality

Throughout the following sections, let W be a Cμ compact manifold without boundary of dimension n.

In section we show an algebraic necessary and sufficient condition for Pareto optimality. The main reference is Wan [\cite=Wan:1977yi].

An r-jet z∈Jr(n,m) is called v-sufficient if for any two realizations f,g of z, f- 1(0) is homeomorphic to g- 1(0) near 0. (We call f a realization of jrf).

Recall that an r-jet z∈Jr(n,m) can be represented as a polynomial mapping in the variables [formula] of degree less or equal to r. We can give the following characterization theorem of v-sufficiency of r-jets.

For a given jet [formula], the following conditions are equivalent:

z is v-sufficient in Cr.

There exists ε > 0 such that [formula] for |z(x)|  ≤  ε|x|r and |x| < ε.

Given any Cr realization f of z, [formula] are linearly independent on [formula], near 0.

(we set [formula]=min[formula], where hi=distance from vi to the subspace spanned by the vectors vj, j  ≠  i.)

See Kuo [\cite=Kuo:1972fk].

Unfortunately, establishing the validity of Kuo conditions, as they are expressed above, is non trivial. The first problem is that the function [formula] is given by an impractical formula. This causes difficulties in the effective evaluation of [formula]. The second problem is that [formula] has to satisfy an inequality in a horn neighbourhood of of z- 1(0) and not in an ordinary neighbourhood of the origin.

On the other hand, there exists an equivalent formulation [\cite=Koz:2010prk] of the v-sufficiency for jets which consists in the computation of the local Lojasiewicz exponent for an associated polynomial function. We discuss this issue in more details in the appendix.

Even if not easily verified, Kuo conditions of Theorem [\ref=th:kuo] are naturally semialgebraic and hence using Tarski-Seidenberg theorem one can obtain the following proposition:

The set of all r-jets which are not v-sufficient forms a semialgebraic subset of codimension greater or equal to |n - m| + r in Jr(n,m).

See Wan [\cite=Wan:1977yi].

Given a r-jet [formula] and a non-empty subset [formula], set [formula].

Let

[formula]

Vr is a semialgebraic set and codim  Vcr  ≥   max {n - m,0} + r.

Let

[formula]

By Proposition [\ref=th:vsuff_semialg] BS it's a semialgebraic set, moreover we have

[formula]

Hence Vr is a semialgebraic set from Theorem [\ref=th:semialg]. Finally note that

[formula]

where [formula]. Hence

[formula]

in fact

[formula]

Vr is a rth-order algebraic condition.

Consider in [formula] a local diffeomorphism near 0 φ:U  →  V, with φ(0) = 0. Let z∈Jr(n,m) be a v-sufficient jet and let f,g be two realizations of z. Then [formula] and [formula] are two realization of the same r-jet z * ∈Jr(n,m) and [formula] and [formula] are homeomorphic. Hence

[formula]

is invariant under the group of local diffeomoprhisms near 0. Using also Lemma [\ref=lm:vr_semialg] we conclude that Vr is a rth-order algebraic condition.

Suppose [formula] are two realizations of the same r-jet in Vr  ⊂  Jr(n,m). If f0 has a local Pareto optimum at the origin then also f1 has a local Pareto optimum at the origin.

For a proof of this Proposition see Wan [\cite=Wan:1977yi]. Here we just want to outline that if one merely assume that z∈Jr(n,m) is v-sufficient then the conclusion of Proposition [\ref=th:pareto_stab] is not necessarily true.

Consider

[formula]

Clearly z = j2f0 = j2f1 is v-sufficient in C2, since for any realization f,g of z we have that f- 1(0,0) and g- 1(0,0) are homeomorphic to (0,0). We note that in this case (0,0) is a strict local Pareto optimum for f0 but is not local Pareto optimum for f1. The problem here is that z is not in V2. Let z1(x,y) =  - x2 be the first component of z and let g(x,y) =  - x2 - y4, h(x,y) =  - x2 + y4 be two realization of z1. Then g- 1(0) = (0,0) is not homeomorphic to [formula], hence z1 is not v-sufficient.

Let [formula] be the semialgebraic subbundle of [formula] with fiber Vr. For convenience, we reformulate a proof in this setting of a result in [\cite=Wan:1977yi].

Let μ  >  min(n,m) + 1 and set q = min(n,m) + 1. Condition Vq is generic in [formula].

Set

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=lm:vr_semialg] codim  Vcq > n hence we have that

[formula]

Thus, applying Thom's Transversality, we can conclude that W is a residual subset of [formula].

Let

[formula]

Polynomial mappings from [formula] to [formula] , which have degree less than or equal to q and vanish at zero, form a vector space Bqn,m and we can take as coordinates the coefficients of the polynomials so that Bqn,m becomes isomorphic to some [formula]. Given [formula], we set [formula]. Thus [formula] is the polynomial mapping with coefficients (aι). Let [formula].

The set

[formula]

is a semialgebraic subset in [formula].

By Theorem [\ref=th:semialg] it suffices to prove that Bc is semialgebraic. Let

[formula]

and set

[formula]

Cleary [formula] is semialgebraic, [formula] and π1 is a polynomial mapping. Using Taski-Seidenberg we conclude that Bc(and hence B) is semialgebraic.

Let

[formula]

Then E is a semialgebraic subset in [formula].

Consider the polynomial mapping

[formula]

Set

[formula]

Clearly [formula] is semialgebraic (since B is semialgebraic). Moreover [formula].

A and E are naturally isomorphic by means of the choice of the coefficients of the polynomials as coordinates, hence we have that A is a semialgebraic subset of Jq(n,m). Moreover, A is clearly invariant under the group of local diffeomorphism of [formula] around 0. Define [formula]. Then C is a q-th algebraic condition and we can define [formula], the semialgebraic subbundle of [formula] with fiber C.

With the following result Y.H.Wan [\cite=Wan:1977yi] proves that for a residual subset of [formula] we have a necessary and sufficient condition for Pareto local optimality.

Let μ  >  q. Then a Cμ map [formula] satisfying condition Vq has a local Pareto optimum at a point x∈W if and only if f satisfies condition C at x, i.e., [formula].

Recall that q = min(n,m) + 1. Let C  ⊂  Jq(n,m) be the qth-order algebraic condition defined above. Set

[formula]

and let f∈M. Assume f has a local Pareto optimum at x∈W. This implies [formula]. On the other hand, assume [formula]. Then by Proposition [\ref=th:pareto_stab] f has a local Pareto optimum at x. Hence we conclude that C is a necessary and sufficient qth-order algebraic condition for x to be a local Pareto optimum of f.

Sufficient regularity for a function

The q-th order condition C  ⊂  Jr(n,m) of the previous section is algebraic, hence by definition it is a semialgebraic subset of Jr(n,m), thus there exists a Whitney stratification S0 of C.

[formula] is not a smooth subbundle, since C is not a smooth submanifold, but it is a stratified set: S0 induces a Whitney stratification S on [formula].

[formula] is semialgebraic and admits a Whitney stratification [formula] s.t. C is union of strata ([formula]).

[formula], the semialgebraic subbundle with fiber [formula], has a Whitney stratification [formula] s.t. [formula] is union of strata.

We define now an important class of functions.

Let μ  >  q + 1 (q = min(n,m) + 1). Then a map [formula] of class Cμ is sufficiently regular if

f satisfies condition Vq.

[formula], for all strata [formula]

Main results

Let μ > min(n,m) + 2. Then the set of local Pareto optima for a sufficently regular function [formula] admits a Whitney stratification.

Let [formula] be a sufficently regular function. By the previous proposition we have that

[formula]

Moreover [formula] admits a Whitney stratification [formula] s.t. [formula] is a substratified set, with stratification S. Then by Proposition [\ref=prop:back_stratification] [formula] admits a Whitney stratification given by

[formula]

Therefore, [formula] admits a Whitney stratification: is union of strata of [formula].

Let μ > min(n,m) + 2. The set of sufficiently regular functions is residual in [formula] i.e., is a countable intersection of dense sets in the Whitney Cμ topology. Furthermore, being [formula] endowed with the Whitney Cμ topology a Baire space, any residual set is also dense.

Let [formula]. Then [formula], where:

[formula] is residual.

[formula] is residual by Thom's Transversality, since [formula] has finitely many strata.

Therefore, for a dense class of smooth functions in any reasonable topology, the Pareto set is a Whitney stratified set. This justifies the fact that one can expect that typically the Pareto set is composed by branches of m - 1 dimensional manifolds with boundaries and corners, and if this is not the case, an arbitrarily small perturbation of the objective functions will bring back the situation to the expected case.

Moreover, the stratification of the Pareto set can be described by polynomial inequalities, derivable from necessary and sufficient algebraic conditions for Pareto optimality. Hence it is important to find a more workable expression of Kuo-conditions. In the Appendix we propose a reformulation to approach the polynomial conditions for v-sufficiency in a more practical way.

Conclusions

Driven by the interpretation of the Darwinian evolution as a the "survival of the fittest" where the fitness function is multi objective, we have analyzed the hierarchical decomposition of the Pareto set in geometrical objects of dimensions [formula], where m is the number of objective functions.

For real world applications, such decomposition can give useful suggestions on the definition of the unknown function optimized by observed realizations, in the biological example, the wild species.

For optimization problems, such decomposition may help to design effective optimization strategies, by composing in a consistent way the Pareto optimal sets of the smaller dimension subproblems, which are easier to study than the full problem with all the functions involved.

It is our conviction that exploring and highlighting such hierarchical structures gives precious insights in MO problems, from the numerical point of view but also from the point of view of the decision maker, which will have in this way a more clear and structured idea of the whole range of possible solutions.

Appendix

Here we want to give a reformulation of Kuo conditions in Theorem [\ref=th:kuo], for details see [\cite=Koz:2010prk]. We will reduce the verification of Kuo conditions to the problem of the rate of growth of a polynomial about one of its roots, which is equivalent to calculation of the so called local Lojasiewicz exponent of a polynomial. Recall that according to the Lojasiewicz theorem [\cite=Loj:1959] [\cite=Loj:1991] [\cite=Malgrange:1967] for any polynomial [formula] with p(0) = 0 there exist constants C,k > 0 s.t.

[formula]

in a neighborhood of the zero root. The last k for which the above inequality holds is called the local Lojasiewicz exponent for p. There is quite a number of publications devoted to evaluation of the Lojasiewicz exponent, see, e.g., [\cite=abderrahmane:2005] [\cite=Chadzynski:1998] [\cite=Kurdyka:2005] [\cite=Barroso:2003] [\cite=Barroso:2005] [\cite=Gwo:1999] [\cite=Kollar:1999] [\cite=Lenarcik:1997]. Given a map [formula] with f(0) = 0 and an integer p  ≥  1 define the following two functions in the variables [formula] and [formula] :

[formula]

and

[formula]

(Where we denote with (df)*(x) the conjugate of df(x)). Recall that an r-jet z∈Jr(n,m) can be represented as a polynomial mapping in the variables [formula] of degree less or equal to r. Then it holds the following theorem

Let [formula] with n  ≥  m. The jet jrf(0) = z is v-sufficient if and only if for evey [formula] there exist q > 0, ε > 0 s.t.

[formula]

Where X represents any one of the two polynomial functions Rp or Tp.
