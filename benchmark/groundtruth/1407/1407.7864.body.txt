The coolest 'stars' are free-floating planets

Introduction

We have witnessed in the last decade the detection of free-floating substellar objects with increasingly lower masses and cooler temperatures that reach the canonical planetary regime of a few Jupiter masses and a few hundred Kelvin. Examples are free-floating planetary mass objects in star-forming regions (e.g., [\citealt=2000Sci...290..103Z]) and ultracool Y dwarfs in the field (e.g., [\citealt=2011ApJ...743...50C]). One of the main open questions in the theory of star formation is: How do these free-floating planetary-like objects - and brown dwarfs in general - form? A high-density phase is necessary for the gravitational fragmentation to create very small Jeans-unstable cores. Proposed scenarios to prevent a substellar core in a dense environment from accreting to stellar mass are ejection of the core through dynamical interactions (e.g., [\citealt=2001AJ....122..432R]) or photo-evaporation of the gas envelope through radiation of a nearby hot star (e.g., [\citealt=2004A&A...427..299W]). Also suggested was the formation of brown dwarfs by disk instabilities in the outer regions of massive circumstellar disks (e.g., [\citealt=2009MNRAS.392..413S]). Alternatively, brown dwarfs could form in a more isolated mode by direct collapse. For example, filament collapse (e.g., Inutsuka & Miyama 1992) might form low-mass cores that experience high self-erosion in outflows and become brown dwarfs (Machida et al. 2009). A key to understanding star and brown dwarf formation is to observationally define the minimum mass that the canonical star-like mode of formation can produce by detecting and exploring the main features characteristic of this process, such as disks, accretion, outflows, and orbiting planets, for the lowest-mass objects.

The first indications for the existence of free-floating planetary mass objects came from observations in the very young σ Orionis cluster [\citep=2000Sci...290..103Z]. While it is difficult to establish the membership to σ Ori and, therefore, the age and mass, some very promising candidates were detected. An example is S Ori 60, for which mid-IR excess indicates a young age [\citep=2008ApJ...688..362L]. Other candidates, however, turned out not to be members of the cluster, such as S Ori 70 ([\citealt=2004ApJ...604..827B]; Peña Ramirez, this volume). The coolest known free-floating objects are Y dwarfs, of which 17 are spectroscopically confirmed to date [\citep=2014AJ....147..113C]. While we can expect many planetary mass objects among Y dwarfs, the age and mass of these nearby field objects are in most cases unknown. The first confirmed Y dwarf, WISE 1828+2650 [\citep=2011ApJ...743...50C], was suggested to have a temperature and mass of only about 300 K and 3-6 MJup, respectively, although there are indications that the temperature might be significantly larger [\citep=2013Sci...341.1492D]. Very recently a remarkably cold and low-mass object was detected in the very near vicinity of our Sun: WISE 0855-0714 at a distance of 2.2 pc has a proposed temperature and mass of 250 K and 3-10 MJup, respectively [\citep=2014ApJ...786L..18L]. Nearby objects that do allow constraints on their age and, therefore, mass are members of young moving groups (see also Faherty, this volume). One of them, PSO J318.5-22, was recently detected to be a planetary-mass member of β Pic. Depending on the assumed age for β Pic its mass is estimated to 6.5 MJup (age: 12 Myr) and 8.4 MJup (21 Myr), respectively ([\citealt=2013ApJ...777L..20L]; Allers, this volume).

To address the question how free-floating planets form, we observed OTS 44, the lowest mass known member of the Chamaeleon I star-forming region (Cha I, ~  2 Myr, 160 pc). OTS 44 was first identified as a brown dwarf candidate in a deep near-IR imaging survey [\citep=1999ApJ...526..336O] and later confirmed as very low-mass substellar object of spectral-type M9.5 based on low-resolution near-IR and optical spectra [\citep=2004ApJ...617..565L]. Its mass was estimated using near-IR spectra to lie in or very close to the planetary regime (~  6-17 M[formula], [\citealt=2013A&A...555A.107B]) with an average rounded value of 12 M[formula].

OTS 44 - a 12 Jupiter mass object with a substantial disk

Mid-IR photometry of OTS 44 by Spitzer/IRAC and MIPS [\citep=2008ApJ...675.1375L] indicated the presence of circumstellar material surrounding OTS 44. Recently, the disk of OTS 44 was detected at far-IR wavelength by Herschel/PACS [\citep=2012ApJ...755...67H]. We re-analyzed the Herschel flux measurement [\citep=joergens2014] and find a slightly smaller value for OTS 44 than [\citet=2012ApJ...755...67H].

We modeled the SED of OTS 44 based on flux measurements from the optical to the far-IR using the radiative transfer code MC3D [\citep=2003ApJ...582..859W]. We employ a passive-disk model consisting of a central substellar source surrounded by a parameterized flared disk in which dust and gas are well mixed and homogeneous throughout the system. We assume dust grains of astronomical silicate (62.5%) and graphite (37.5%) with minimum and maximum grain sizes of 0.005 μm and 0.25 μm, respectively. As there are model degeneracies between different disk parameters, we conducted a Bayesian analysis to estimate the validity range for each parameter. See [\citet=2013A&A...558L...7J] for details. Fig. [\ref=fig:sed] shows the SED and the best-fit disk model of OTS 44 based on the re-analysis of the Herschel fluxes [\citep=joergens2014]. We find that OTS 44 has a highly flared disk (β  >  1.3) with a disk mass of 3.25[formula], i.e. about 10  MEarth.

OTS 44 - a 12 Jupiter mass object with significant accretion

We took near-IR J-band spectra (1.1-1.4 μm) of OTS 44 with SINFONI at the VLT at a medium spectral resolution (R=λ/[formula], [\citealt=2013A&A...555A.107B]). We discovered a strong, broad, and variable Paschen β (Pa β) emission line of OTS 44 in these spectra [\citep=2013A&A...558L...7J], as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:pabeta] (left, middle). Furthermore, a prominent Hα emission line is visible in the optical spectrum of [\citet=2007ApJS..173..104L] as shown in the right panel of Fig. [\ref=fig:pabeta]. Both of these Hydrogen emission lines exhibit a broad profile with velocities of ±  200 km s- 1 or more. We determined the equivalent width (EW) of both lines. The Hα line has a symmetrically shaped profile with an EW of -141 Å, demonstrating that OTS 44 is actively accreting. The profile of the Pa β line is significantly variable between the two observing epochs separated by a few days (EW of -7 and -4 Å).

We determined the mass accretion rate of OTS 44 based on the Hα line by assuming that the Hα emission is entirely formed by accretion processes. We derived an Hα line luminosity log LHα ([formula]) of -6.16 for OTS 44 and applied the empirical relation between the Hα line and accretion luminosity of Fang et al. (2009), which is based on log LHα ([formula]) ranging between -1 and -6. We estimate an mass accretion rate of OTS 44 of 7.6×  10- 12 [formula].

Conclusions

We have discovered strong, broad, and variable Pa β emission of the young very low-mass substellar object OTS 44 (M9.5) in VLT/SINFONI spectra, which is evidence for active accretion of a planetary mass object [\citep=2013A&A...558L...7J]. We determined the properties of the disk that surrounds OTS 44 through MC3D radiative transfer modeling of flux measurements from the optical to the far-IR including Herschel data [\citep=2013A&A...558L...7J] [\citep={joergens2014}]. We found that OTS 44 has a highly flared disk (β  >  1.3) with a mass of 3.25[formula], i.e. about 10  MEarth. We also investigated the Hα line of OTS 44 in a MAGELLAN I/IMACS spectrum spectrum and found strong Hα emission with an EW of -141 Å indicative of active accretion. Both the Pa β and Hα emission lines of OTS 44 have broad profiles with the wings extending to velocities of about ±  200 km s- 1. The Pa β emission is significantly variable on timescales of a few days, indicating variability in accretion-related processes of OTS 44. We estimated the mass accretion rate of OTS 44 to 7.6×  10- 12 [formula] by using the Hα line. A mass accretion rate based on the Pa β line gives a significantly higher value, and we speculate that part of the Pa β emission might come from other processes related to accretion, such as outflows. Furthermore, in the course of studying OTS 44, we fitted a photospheric BT-Settl model to its optical and near-IR SED and derived a lower effective temperature and higher extinction than was previously found [\citep=2007ApJS..173..104L].

We have presented the first detection of Pa β emission for a free-floating object below the deuterium-burning limit. Our analysis of Pa β and Hα emission of OTS 44 demonstrates that free-floating objects of a few Jupiter masses can be active accretors. OTS 44 can be seen as free-floating analog of recently detected accreting planetary mass companions that orbit stars (e.g., [\citealt=2011ApJ...743..148B], [\citealt=2014ApJ...783L..17Z]) and it plays a key role in the study of disk evolution and accretion physics in an extremely low-gravity and -temperature environment. Furthermore, OTS 44 (M9.5) is the lowest-mass object to date for which the disk mass is determined based on far-IR data. Also interesting in this context is the mm-detection of an M9 dwarf [\citep=2006ApJ...645.1498S]. Our detections therefore extend the exploration of disks and accretion during the T Tauri phase down to the planetary mass regime. Plotting the relative disk masses of stars and brown dwarfs including OTS 44 (Fig. [\ref=fig:mdisk]) shows that the ratio of the disk-to-central-mass of about 10- 2 found for objects between 0.03 [formula] and 14 [formula] is also valid for OTS 44 at a mass of about 0.01 [formula]. Furthermore, the mass accretion rate of OTS 44 is consistent with a decreasing trend from stars of several solar masses to substellar objects down to 0.01 [formula] (Fig. [\ref=fig:macc]). It is also obvious from this figure that OTS 44 has a relatively high mass accretion rate considering its small mass. These observations show that the processes that accompany canonical star formation, disks and accretion, are present down to a central mass of a few Jupiter masses. This suggests that OTS 44 is formed like a star and that the increasing number of young free-floating planets and ultra-cool T and Y field dwarfs are the low-mass extension of the stellar population.

Figure [\ref=fig:teffevol] illustrates how a very young free-floating planetary mass object of about 10 Jupiter masses, such as OTS 44, cools down while aging and becomes an L dwarf at about 10 Myr, similar to PSO J318.5-22, and a Y dwarf at ≥  1 Gyr, similar to WISE 0855-0714. This illustration uses a plot of the evolution of the effective temperature by [\citet=2001RvMP...73..719B]. While this might not be the most sophisticated evolutionary model to date and discrepancies with observations can be seen in the temperature (see caption of Fig. [\ref=fig:teffevol]), it nevertheless shows very nicely the general picture of a substellar object shifting through spectral classes during its evolution.
