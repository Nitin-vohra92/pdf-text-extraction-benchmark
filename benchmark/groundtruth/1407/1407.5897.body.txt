The properties of single WO stars

Introduction

The nature of the very rare WO stars is still under debate. Although it is clear that they are highly evolved massive stars, their evolutionary connection to the more common carbon sequence Wolf-Rayet (WC) stars remains unclear. To unravel their nature, we are undertaking a project targeting all the known WO stars. Here we present preliminary results of the first homogeneous analysis of the single WOs.

Observational sample and spectral classification

We have obtained the near-ultraviolet to near-infrared spectra of all known WO stars using the X-Shooter spectrograph on ESO's Very Large Telescope [\citep=massey2014]. The spectra cover a wavelength range from 3 000 to 25 000 Å  at a resolving power of R  ~  8000. The sample consists of three stars in the Milky Way (MW), two in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and one in IC 1613. The two WO stars in a binary system have also been observed, but are not analysed in this work. Figure [\ref=fig:atlas] shows the X-Shooter spectra of all WO stars.

The spectral type of the single stars is determined using the classification criteria from [\cite=crowther1998]. These are based on the equivalent width ratios of O vi 3811-34 Å  / O v 5590 Å  and O vi 3811-24 Å / C iv 5801-12 Å, as well as the full width at half maximum of C iv 5801-12 Å. The derived spectral types are given in Table [\ref=tab:results].

Modelling and conclusions

We model the X-Shooter spectra using cmfgen [\citep=hillier1998] following the method described in [\cite=tramper2013]. While the observed strong O vi 3811-34 Å  emission is not (fully) reproduced, the rest of the spectrum is very well represented by our models. Preliminary parameters derived from the modelling are given in Table [\ref=tab:results]. Note that the models are currently still being refined, and these values are subject to small changes.

The surface abundances of the WO stars indicate that they have at least burned two-third of the helium in their core, and are expected to explode as type Ic supernovae within 105 years. Most evolved is WR102, which may have already exhausted the helium in its core and will likely end its life in less than 104 years. Compared to WC stars, the WO stars are hotter and show higher surface abundances of carbon and oxygen.
