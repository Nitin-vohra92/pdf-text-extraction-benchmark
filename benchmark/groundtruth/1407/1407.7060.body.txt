Localized versus itinerant states created by multiple oxygen vacancies in SrTiO3

Introduction. The discovery of a two-dimensional electron gas at the interface between SrTiO3 (STO) and LaAlO3 (LAO) in an LAO/STO heterostructure by Ohtomo and Hwang [\cite=Ohtomo2004] initiated intense research efforts [\cite=Mannhart2008] [\cite=Huijben2009] on these materials and unexpected phases at the interface like superconductivity [\cite=Reyren2007] and ferromagnetism [\cite=Brinkman2007] were reported. However, there has been some controversy on the mechanisms leading to the conducting interface, with proposals ranging from electronic reconstruction as a way to avoid a polar catastrophe [\cite=Okamoto2004] to various mechanisms based on extrinsic defects like oxygen vacancies [\cite=Siemons2007] [\cite=Herranz2007] and site disorder [\cite=Nakagawa2006] [\cite=Li2014]. More recently, a metallic state has also been discovered at the surfaces of freshly cleaved SrTiO3 [\cite=Santander-Syro2011] [\cite=Meevasana2011] and KTaO3 [\cite=King2012]. In the case of pure SrTiO3 surfaces, the metallic state and the photoemission spectra can be well explained with oxygen vacancies [\cite=Santander-Syro2011] [\cite=Shen2012] [\cite=Wang2014]. Besides the spectral weight at the Fermi level, the presence of a peak at about 1.3 eV below the Fermi level was also reported [\cite=Santander-Syro2011]. Aiura et al. [\cite=Aiura2002] observed in photoemission experiments for lightly electron-doped SrTiO3 under different oxygen pressure conditions, that the peak at 1.3 eV appears to depend on the oxygen defect density. As pristine SrTiO3 is a semiconductor with a large band gap of Eg = 3.2 eV. Therefore, creating a number of Ti t2g carriers and assuming a rigid band shift should lead to a photoemission spectrum with a wide gap below the states near the Fermi level. However, several experiments [\cite=Courths1980] [\cite=Aiura2002] [\cite=Kim2009] [\cite=Santander-Syro2011] [\cite=Meevasana2011] [\cite=Hatch2013] show that the E =  - 1.3 eV feature is robust and reproducible but sensitive to oxygen pressure. Understanding the nature and orbital character of the E =  - 1.3 eV feature as well as the interplay between localized and itinerant states created by the presence of oxygen vacancies will be the main focus of our study. In fact, the role of oxygen vacancies is presently being intensively discussed in a wider context of materials. For instance, oxygen vacancies have been proposed to be responsible for the suppression of the metal-insulator transition in VO2 [\cite=Jaewoo2013], as well as for the electron beam-induced growth of iron nanowires on TiO2 [\cite=Vollnhals2013], to mention a few. Therefore, getting a deeper microscopic understanding of the role of oxygen vacancies in transition metal oxides can further elucidate the mechanisms behind the above observed phenomena.

There have been a number of previous theoretical efforts dealing with oxygen vacancies in SrTiO3. Hou and Terakura [\cite=Hou2010] performed GGA+U calculations of single and double oxygen vacancies in bulk SrTiO3. Several calculations based on hybrid functionals [\cite=Carrasco2006] [\cite=Mitra2012] or LDA+U [\cite=Lin2012] find an oxygen defect related in-gap state for SrTiO3. Lin and Demkov [\cite=Lin2013] use a three-orbital Hubbard orbital to study the effect of electronic correlation on an oxygen vacancy in SrTiO3. Pavlenko et al. [\cite=Pavlenko2012] have analyzed the orbital reconstruction at SrTiO3/LaAlO3 interfaces due to oxygen vacancies within GGA+U. We will extend this existing work by (i) focusing on SrTiO3 surfaces and by (ii) using large supercells that allow us to investigate two and three oxygen vacancies at realistic defect densities.

In our study we show that (i) multiple subsurface oxygen defects are energetically less favorable than configurations with at least one defect in the TiO2 surface layer. (ii) Vertically, defects show a clear tendency to cluster; defect configurations with two oxygen defects in the first two layers (surface TiO2 and first subsurface SrO layer) are clearly preferred over configurations with one or two layers of vertical distance between the two vacancies. In contrast, in the direction parallel to the surface, we find a tendency of vacancies to distribute uniformly. (iii) Moreover, while the isolated surface oxygen vacancy creates itinerant Ti t2g electrons, the subsurface vacancy creates two localized states of Ti eg character in the two adjacent Ti ions. The localized states have 3dz2 character with some 4pz weight for oxygen vacancies in a subsurface SrO layer, and 3dx2 - y2 character with some 4px / py weight for vacancies in a subsurface TiO2 layer (see Fig. [\ref=fig:sto_scheme]). Finally, we also show that (iv) the precise condition for an in-gap state produced from surface vacancies is the formation of a TiO3(vacancy)2 cluster.

Method. In order to investigate the role of oxygen vacancies in SrTiO3, we performed density functional theory calculations for a number of SrTiO3 slabs with various configurations of oxygen vacancies and analyzed the origin of the states appearing near the Fermi level. We have considered stoichiometric SrTiO3 slabs with (001) surfaces, as discussed in Ref. [\cite=Shen2012]. Based on our previous experience, we focus on 3  ×  3  ×  4 supercells with (a) TiO2 and (b) SrO termination. We use the energetically most favorable structures with a single vacancy in the TiO2 or SrO surface layer as starting point for structures with a second or even a third oxygen defect. We relax these structure candidates using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) [\cite=Kresse1993] [\cite=Kresse1996] with the projector augmented wave (PAW) basis [\cite=Bloechl1994]. As it has been found that relaxations with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) tend to make the octahedral environment of transition metal ions too homogeneous [\cite=Foyevtsova2011] we use a GGA+U functional [\cite=Liechtenstein1995] with literature values for SrTiO3 [\cite=Okamoto2006] of U = 5 eV and J = 0.64 eV. We analyze the electronic structure and total energy of the predicted slab geometries using an all electron full potential local orbital (FPLO) [\cite=Koepernik1999] basis.

Results. In Figure [\ref=fig:structure], we show examples of SrTiO3 supercells with two oxygen vacancies. They correspond to the energetically most favorable configurations with the first vacancy in the TiO2 surface layer (layer 1) and the second vacancy in (a) the surface layer (layer 1), (b) the first subsurface SrO layer (layer 2), (c) the first subsurface TiO2 layer (layer 3) or (d) the second subsurface SrO layer (layer 4). An overview of the energetics is shown in Figure [\ref=fig:energies]. Energies are given with respect to the energy E0 of the configuration drawn in Figure [\ref=fig:structure] (b) which turned out to be the optimum. We find a clear trend: Defect configurations with one vacancy on the surface (layer 1) and the second one in the first subsurface layer (layer 2) are energetically more favorable than configurations where the two oxygen vacancies are separated by one or two pristine layers. This means that there is a clear tendency of oxygen vacancies to cluster vertically near the surface of SrTiO3. In the direction parallel to the surface, however, the outcome of our simulations is more complex. While configurations with both defects in the surface TiO2 layer (circles in Figure [\ref=fig:energies]) show a weak tendency to cluster, the energetically most favorable corresponds to distributing one defect in the first (TiO2) and one defect in the second (SrO) layer (triangle at E = E0 in Figure [\ref=fig:energies]) with a maximal distance between the two vacancies within our simulation cell. This result suggests a tendency to uniform distribution of defects parallel to the surface. Turning to the defects separated by a pristine SrO layer from the surface oxygen defect (diamonds in Figure [\ref=fig:energies]), we observe a weak preference of defects to lower vacancy-vacancy separation, i. e. to cluster with the SrO spacer layer between the two defects.

We now proceed with an analysis of the electronic structure of the two oxygen vacancy configurations. Figure [\ref=fig:dostwo] shows the density of states for all structures discussed before. Gray shading indicates electronic states which are populated with electrons donated by the oxygen vacancy. All investigated structures have Ti t2g weight near the Fermi level. A detailed analysis of this weight shows that a large amount of Ti ions in the supercell contribute to it and the corresponding bands are dispersive, indicating that these electrons are itinerant. We have shown in Ref. [\cite=Shen2012] that this is a result of structural relaxation; if all ions are kept in the ideal perovskite position upon creation of an oxygen vacancy, only Ti t2g orbitals next to the vacancy are occupied, and an unphysical localized t2g electron density is created. As a second important feature, all structures in Figure [\ref=fig:dostwo] (b) and all except the first one in Figure [\ref=fig:dostwo] (a) also show sharp in-gap states; these are states typically created by subsurface oxygen defects and localized on the two Ti ions adjacent to the defect. These states have Ti eg character with small admixture of 4p states, and they clearly fall into two categories: Ti dz2 states created by vacancies in a SrO layer, and Ti dx2 - y2 states produced by vacancies in subsurface TiO2 layers. This orbital occupancy is due to the fact that in the case of an oxygen defect in a SrO layer, the Ti ions neighboring the defect are above and below the defect where the vertical axis corresponds to the z axis in the orbital projection (see Fig. [\ref=fig:sto_scheme] (a)). In the case of a subsurface defect in a TiO2 layer, the two neighboring Ti ions sit at half a lattice spacing either along x or along y direction with respect to the vacancy (see Fig. [\ref=fig:sto_scheme] (b)). Figure [\ref=fig:character] (a) illustrates the orbital distribution of the defect configuration shown in Figure [\ref=fig:structure] (b) where one vacancy is on the TiO2 surface (layer 1) and the second vacancy is on the subsurface SrO layer (layer 2). Figure [\ref=fig:character] (b) displays the orbital distribution for a representative example of one vacancy on the TiO2 surface (layer 1) and the second one on the TiO2 subsurface (layer 3), as in Figure [\ref=fig:structure] (c).

In-gap states are also present when oxygen vacancies cluster at the surface TiO2 layer (cases 3 and 4 in Fig. [\ref=fig:dostwo]). Our calculations show that the precise condition for such in-gap states produced from surface vacancies is the formation of a TiO3(vacancy)2 cluster. In fact, the energetically most favorable configuration with two vacancies in the surface TiO2 layer (see Figure [\ref=fig:structure] (a)) is of this type. On the other hand, well separated oxygen vacancies in the surface TiO2 layer which form TiO4(vacancy) clusters only (cases 1 and 2 in Fig. [\ref=fig:dostwo]) lead to an itinerant 2D electron gas of Ti t2g electrons but no in-gap states.

In order to further test the distribution of oxygen-vacancy-induced extra charge, we also calculated the electronic properties of 3  ×  3  ×  4 SrTiO3 slabs with three oxygen vacancy configurations as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:structthree]. In all three cases in-gap states appear below the Fermi level since some oxygen vacancies are either below the TiO2 surface layer or they are clustered around a Ti on the surface. Comparison of the two-vacancy with the three-vacancy cases shows that the in-gap weight is proportional to the oxygen vacancy density. This observation is in qualitative agreement with experiment [\cite=Aiura2002] but it should be investigated further.

Discussion. Analysis of the previous LDA+U results allows us to draw some important conclusions regarding the role of oxygen vacancies in SrTiO3. (1) If oxygen vacancies are only on the surface and well separated from each other, the two electrons per vacancy contribute only to the conduction band and no localized in-gap states are formed independently of the U value considered in the LDA+U calculations. Only when oxygen vacancies cluster on the surface, assuming TiO3(vacancy)2 configurations, or are positioned in subsurface layers do we observe the formation of in-gap states coming from the hybridized 3eg with 4p states from the Ti neighboring the vacancy. This is in contrast to a recent study by Lin et al. [\cite=Lin2013] where it was suggested that the oxygen-vacancy induced in-gap state traps at most one electron from the oxygen vacancy while the second electron contributes to the conduction. (2) The energy ordering of the different vacancies configurations with presence of in-gap states can be attributed to two effects: (i) the gain in energy due to the formation of a bound oxygen-vacancy state (in-gap state) composed of the hybridized Ti eg and 4p states neighboring the vacancy as well as (ii) the gain in elastic energy due to the lattice deformation after extracting oxygen. In fact, calculations of total energies of relaxed versus unrelaxed slab structures point to a significant contribution of the second effect that should be considered together with the formation of the bound state. Moreover, the lattice deformation is important in the formation of an itinerant 2D electron gas due to surface oxygen vacancies. (3) The weight of the in-gap state scales with the oxygen vacancy concentration in agreement with photoemission experiments. (4) The formation energy of an oxygen vacancy in SrTiO3 is about 7.7 eV for a single vacancy and 4.8 eV per vacancy for two and three vacancies. From our present calculations we can only speculate about possible formation mechanisms of such vacancies. Certainly the exposure to energetic photons in photoemission experiments is a possible cause.

In summary, by considering different configurations of oxygen vacancies in SrTiO3 and subsequent analysis of the energetics and electronic properties via extensive DFT calculations we can explain the origin of observed in-gap states as well as conduction electrons in photoemission experiments on SrTiO3 surfaces and provide predictions for the behavior of a finite concentration of oxygen vacancies in SrTiO3.
