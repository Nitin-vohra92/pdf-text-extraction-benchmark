The missing proof of Paley's theorem about lacunary coefficients

Introduction

Given an integrable function f on the interval ( - π,π], form its Fourier coefficients

[formula]

Use the same measure (1 / 2π)  dt in computing Lp norms. Call a set of nonnegative integers strongly lacunary if it is the range of a sequence, (kj) say, with the property that

[formula]

In Section [\ref=sec:two-step], we give a new proof of the following statement.

There is a constant C so that if K is strongly lacunary, and if (n)  =  0 when n < 0, then

[formula]

Paley's proof [\cite=REACH1] of this used "analytic" factorization of such functions f as products of two measurable functions with the same absolute value and with Fourier coefficients that also vanish at all negative integers. We use factors with the same absolute value, but we do not require that their coefficients vanish anywhere. Paley's proof used orthogonal projections of L2 onto subspaces determined by the set K. We use subspaces that also depend on the choice of factors.

This allows us to give the first direct proofs of some refinements, stated here as Theorems [\ref=th:S(K)] and [\ref=th:S_1(K)], of Paley's theorem. They were proved in a dual way in [\cite=FouArk], and were used there to give a new proof of "half" of Littlewood's conjecture about L1 norms of exponential sums.

The functions in this paper are scalar-valued. Our methods also apply to some operator-valued functions, as in [\cite=LP]. That extension and others will be presented elsewhere.

Pairs of nested projections

When f satisfies the hypotheses of Theorem  [\ref=th:Paley], let g and h be measurable functions such that |g|  =  |h| and [formula]. Let z be the exponential function mapping each number t in the interval ( - π,π] to eit. Then g and the products znh belong to L2(π,π]. Consider the inner products

[formula]

It suffices to prove inequality [\eqref=eq:basicestimate] when the set K is the range of a finite increasing sequence (kj)Jj = 1. Let Aj be the operator on L2( - π,π) that multiplies each function by zkj. Then

[formula]

This reduces matters to showing that there is a constant C so that

[formula]

Let Lj be the closure in L2 of the subspace spanned by the products znh in which n  <   - kj. Let Pj project L2 orthogonally onto Lj. These projections form a decreasing nest.

Also consider the subspaces AjLj and Aj + 1Lj. Every image AjLj is the closure in L2 of the span of the products znh for which n  <  0. By formula ([\ref=eq:coefficients]) and the hypothesis that (n)  =  0 for all n  <  0, the function g is orthogonal to AjLj for all j.

When j  <  J, the image Aj + 1Lj is the closure of the span of the products znh with n  <  kj + 1  -  kj. Strong lacunarity is equivalent to having

[formula]

It follows that

[formula]

Since kj  -  kj - 1  ≤  kj  <  kj + 1 - kj, the subspaces Aj + 1Lj increase as j increases. Let Qj project orthogonally onto Aj + 1Lj when 1  ≤  j  <  J; let Q0  =  0 and QJ  =  I. The projections Qj form an increasing nest.

For each j, these choices and the membership condition [\eqref=eq:Membership] make

[formula]

Rewrite the latter in the form

[formula]

By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, the fact that the operators Aj are contractions, and the nesting of the projections Qj,

[formula]

Note that b1  =  0, since Q0  =  0. When j  >  1, the fact that Aj is unitary and the definitions of Pj - 1 and Qj - 1 make AjPj - 1  =  Qj - 1Aj and

[formula]

The fact that [formula] then makes bj  =  (g,Aj(Pj - 1  -  Pj)h). It follows that [formula] too. So inequality ([\ref=eq:HilbertEstimate]) holds with C = 2.

The refinements in Theorems [\ref=th:S(K)] and [\ref=th:S_1(K)] below were proved in [\cite=FouArk] using dual methods. Here, Theorem [\ref=th:S(K)] will follow from an analysis of the proof above. The notions in the next two sections will then allow us to deduce Theorem [\ref=th:S_1(K)] in a direct way.

To organize Paley's proof in the same way, replace the subspaces Lj above with the closures in L2 of the spans of the functions zn for which n  <   - kj; this does not change the nesting of these subspaces or their images Aj + 1Lj. Assuming that ĝ(n)  =  0 for all n  <  0 guarantees that [formula] for all j. Assuming that [formula] is analytic makes (n)  =  0 for all n  >  0. It follows that Ajh∈Aj + 1Lj when j  <  J. We do not know how to make this approach work under the weaker hypotheses in Theorem [\ref=th:S(K)].

The subspaces Lj that we used in the proof of Theorem [\ref=th:Paley] are invariant under multiplication by [formula], and their conjugates are invariant under multiplication by z. In the discussion in [\cite=Forelli], it is observed, when f is analytic, that those conjugate subspaces must be simply invariant, and that one can apply the characterization of simply invariant subspaces of [formula] to show that both factors [formula] and g of f can be chosen to be analytic too.

Partially ordered dual groups

Our proof of Theorem [\ref=th:Paley] resembles the one given in [\cite=FouPac] for the following statement, which differs only in the set where [formula] is required to vanish.

There is a constant C so that if K is strongly lacunary, and if (n)  =  0 for all positive integers n lying outside K, then

[formula]

Various other methods in [\cite=Mey],  [\cite=Vino] and [\cite=FouPac] derive this conclusion from weaker conditions on K or f. In Remark [\ref=rm:ComplementaryProof] below, we outline our direct proof of Theorem [\ref=th:complementary]. That proof extended to compact abelian groups with totally ordered duals.

As in [\cite=RudGp], where the dual group Γ is written additively, those are the cases where there is an additive semigroup P with the two properties

[formula]

Our proof of Theorem [\ref=th:complementary] also worked for partially ordered discrete duals, where the nonnegative cone P need only satisfy the first condition above. We now confirm that our new proof of Paley's theorem extends in a similar way.

Call a subset K of P strongly lacunary if for each pair γ and γ' of distinct members of K, one of the differences γ  -  2γ' or γ'  -  2γ belongs to the strictly positive cone [formula]. We will use this property and a variant of it to prove Theorem [\ref=th:S_1(K)].

The following extension of Theorem [\ref=th:Paley] is already known [\cite=RudGp], with a different proof, in the cases where the partial order on Γ is a total order.

There is a constant C with the following property. Let G be a compact abelian group with a partially ordered dual Γ. Let K be strongly lacunary relative to that order. If f∈L1(G), and (γ)  =  0 for all characters γ in the strictly negative cone - P', then

[formula]

Without loss of generality, K is finite. Enumerate it in increasing order as (γj)Jj = 1. Factor f measurably as [formula] with |g|  =  |h|. Make the following choices for each j. Let Aj be the operator that multiplies each function in L2(G) by γj. Let Lj be the closure in L2(G) of the subspace spanned the products γh in which γ  <    -  γj. Define the nested projections Pj and Qj as before, and split the inner product (g,Ajh) in the same way to get inequality ([\ref=eq:partPaley]) with C = 2.

In [\cite=FouPac], we proved Theorem [\ref=th:complementary] using the same factorization and the same operators Aj as in our proof of Theorem [\ref=th:Paley], but we used the subspaces Mj spanned by the products znh in which - kj  ≤  n  <  0. Those subspaces form an increasing nest, as do their images AjMj. We used orthogonal projections Pj and Qj with ranges Mj and AjMj respectively, with P0  =  0 and QJ + 1  =  I. The hypothesis that [formula] vanishes in the gaps between the indices kj implies that [formula] for all j  <  J. Also, Ajh∈Aj + 1Mj + 1 for these values of j. Let

[formula]

Then aj  +  bj expands as an alternating sum of four inner products. Again, the last term in that sum vanishes, the middle two terms cancel, and the first term is equal to (g,Ajh). Estimate [formula] norms as above.

The proof just above was derived from Paley's proof of his Theorem [\ref=th:Paley], but it no longer worked for that theorem. Our new proof of the latter resulted from a study of the argument in Remark [\ref=rm:Complementary] and the proof, via analytic factorization, of the version of Theorem [\ref=th:Paley] in [\cite=KP].

In Section [\ref=sec:totalize], we use a standard construction to show that many cases of Theorem [\ref=th:partialPaley] follow from the corresponding known result for total orders. The same is true for many of the results in [\cite=FouPac]. The method used there and the one used here are more elementary, however, and they give better values for the constants C in the various theorems.

The dual method in [\cite=FouArk] shows that the best constant in Theorems [\ref=th:Paley] and [\ref=th:partialPaley] is [formula]. The dual method in [\cite=Clu] shows that the best constant in Theorem [\ref=th:complementary] is at most [formula].

In Theorem [\ref=th:partialPaley], the set where the coefficients are required to vanish is no larger than a half space. Other methods [\cite=Ob] work when that set is significantly larger than a half space; in such cases, those methods yield inequality [\eqref=eq:partPaley] for more sets K.

Finite Riesz products

We consider Fourier coefficients of certain measures in Theorem [\ref=th:S_1(K)]. We confirm here that Theorem [\ref=th:partialPaley] extends to regular Borel measures, with the usual convention that

[formula]

for such a measure μ. We also show how, in most cases of interest, Theorem [\ref=th:partialPaley] follows, with a larger constant C, from its special case where the order is total.

Denote the total variation of μ by [formula]. Continue to work with a partial order on Γ. Suppose throughout this section that û vanishes on  - P'.

Given a finite subset K of Γ, let [formula]. Expand the product

[formula]

of nonnegative factors as a sum of finitely-many terms c(γ)γ, where

[formula]

with εγ'∈{ - 1,0,1} in all cases. In the additive notation for Γ,

[formula]

Denote the set of such characters γ by [formula]; this includes the identity element 0 of Γ, written as the empty sum. Then

Each member γ of K' has a representation [\eqref=eq:trimmed] with εγ  =  1 and with εγ'  =  0 otherwise.

c(γ)  =  1 / 2 if there are no other representations of γ.

c(γ)  >  1 / 2 if there are other representations of γ.

Similarly, c(0)  ≥  1.

Now assume that K is strongly lacunary. Then

[formula].

The only representation ([\ref=eq:trimmed]) of 0 is the empty sum.

Hence c(0)  =  1. So [formula] vanishes off [formula], with

[formula]

Since RK  ≥  0,

[formula]

Let [formula]. Then [formula] vanishes on - P', and

[formula]

Applying Theorem [\ref=th:partialPaley] to fK yields that

[formula]

In many cases, the partial order on Γ extends to a total order. That is, the cone P imbeds in a larger cone P̃ that satisfies both conditions in line ([\ref=eq:total]). Then the set K is strongly lacunary relative to P̃. Note that [formula] vanishes off P, since the support of [formula] is included in the set [formula], and [formula] vanishes on - P'. In particular, [formula] vanishes on -  P̃'.

Theorem [\ref=th:partialPaley] is already known for the total order given by P̃, and yields that [formula] It follows as above that

[formula]

We do not know how to use the method above to prove Theorems [\ref=th:S(K)] and [\ref=th:S_1(K)] below.

Using the trigonometric polynomials constructed in [\cite=BPR] instead of the Riesz products above gives inequality [\eqref=eq:PaleyForMeasures] with the constant 4 replaced by 2.

Analysing our method

Theorems [\ref=th:Paley] and [\ref=th:complementary] both state that if [formula] vanishes on a suitable part of the complement of a strongly lacunary set K, then

[formula]

In [\cite=FouJMAnAp], an examination of the proof in Remark [\ref=rm:ComplementaryProof] of Theorem [\ref=th:complementary] revealed that inequality ([\ref=eq:commonestimate]) follows, with C = 2, if (n)  =  0 whenever n is equal to an alternating sum

[formula]

with at least 3 terms and with a strictly increasing index sequence [formula]. There is no requirement here that K be strongly lacunary, or that it be enumerated in increasing order.

We now examine our new proof of Theorem [\ref=th:Paley] in a similar way. Given a subset D of [formula], let V(D) denote the closed subspace of [formula] spanned by the products znh for which n∈D. The subspaces Lj used to prove Paley's theorem had the form V(Dj) with [formula].

For any choice of sets Dj, let Lj  =  V(Dj). Then

[formula]

with j  <  J in the latter case. We required that g be orthogonal to the subspace AjLj for all j > 1. By formula ([\ref=eq:coefficients]), this happens if only if

[formula]

We look for small sets Dj for which the rest of the proof works.

It uses three other properties of the subspaces Lj and their images.

Ajh∈Aj + 1Lj when j  <  J.

Lj  ⊃  Lj + 1 when j  <  J.

AjLj - 1  ⊂  Aj + 1Lj when 1  <  j  <  J.

The membership condition ([\ref=it:Membership]) holds if

[formula]

The subspaces Lj and their images Aj + 1Lj nest suitably if

The only condition on DJ is that it be included in DJ - 1; so let DJ be the empty set. Consider the sets Gj + 1: = kj + 1  +  Dj when j  <  J. The three conditions on the sets Dj correspond to requiring that when j < J, with j  ≥  2 in condition [\eqref=eq:ShiftedGj'sAntinest]. Rewrite that condition as

[formula]

where Δkj  =  kj + 1  -  kj. By inclusions [\eqref=eq:ShiftedCj'sAntinest], [\eqref=eq:Cj'sNest] and [\eqref=eq:ShiftedCj'sAntinest],

[formula]

So Gj + 1  -  2Δkj  -  Δkj - 1  ⊂  Gj - 1 if j  >  2. Iterating this reasoning shows that if i and i' are integers with 1  <  i  <  i'  <  J and if (mj')i'j'  =  i is a sequence of positive integers, then [formula] Combine this with condition [\eqref=eq:InCj] to get that

[formula]

Since [formula], the expression on the left above is equal to

[formula]

say, where nj'  ≥  0 for all j' and ni'  >  0.

When 1  <  j  <  J, condition [\eqref=eq:Cj'sNest] forces Gj + 1 to contain the integers of the form [\eqref=eq:Shiftki] when 1  <  i  ≤  j + 1. By condition [\eqref=eq:InCj] it must also contain ki when 1  ≤  i  ≤  j. When i  >  1, combine these observations to see that Gj + 1 must contain all integers m with a representation

[formula]

satisfying the following conditions:

1  <  i  ≤   min {j  +  1,J - 1}.

The coefficients nj' are nonnegative integers.

If i  =  j + 1, then nj'  ≠  0 for some j'.

Similar reasoning shows that Gj + 1 must also contain the integers given by the sums [\eqref=eq:DeltaXj's] with i = 1 and nonnegative integer coefficients provided that n1  =  0 and the set of indices j'  ≥  j + 1 for which nj'  ≠  0 has no gaps and contains j + 1 unless that set is empty.

One can easily check that if each set Gj + 1 contains the points specified in the previous paragraph and no others, then conditions [\eqref=eq:InCj], [\eqref=eq:Cj'sNest] and [\eqref=eq:ShiftedCj'sAntinest] all hold. For uniformity, we elect instead to let Gj + 1 be the set of all integers m given by formula [\eqref=eq:DeltaXj's] with the three properties listed below it except for the requirement that i  >  1. Conditions [\eqref=eq:InCj], [\eqref=eq:Cj'sNest] and [\eqref=eq:ShiftedCj'sAntinest] are again easy to check.

We strengthen the hypothesis [\eqref=eq:hypothesis] slightly by requiring that [formula] vanish on the set [formula]. Then

[formula]

since DJ is empty and kj  +  Dj  =  Gj + 1  -  Δkj when j  <  J. It follows that [formula] consists of all integers m represented by sums [\eqref=eq:DeltaXj's] with nonnegative integer coefficients nj' that do not all vanish.

Rewrite this in the form

[formula]

Then [formula] if and only if the integer coefficients  εj' satisfy the following conditions, which arose for dual methods in [\cite=FouArk] and [\cite=Yudin].

The full sum [formula] is equal to 1.

All partial sums of the full sum are nonnegative.

All partial sums after the first positive one are positive.

Some partial sum is greater than 1.

Extend the definition of [formula] to infinite sequences (kj) by taking the union of the sets [formula] over all finite subsequences (k'j) of (kj).

Our direct proof of Paley's theorem yields the following.

Let K be a subset of the group [formula], and let [formula]. If [formula] vanishes on [formula] for some enumeration (kj) of K, then

[formula]

Again, there is no requirement that K be strongly lacunary or that it be enumerated in increasing order. In many cases, [formula] overlaps with K, and the hypothesis in the theorem then forces [formula] to vanish on that overlap. When K is strongly lacunary and enumerated in increasing order, no such overlap can occur, because [formula] is then included in the set of negative integers. In most cases, that inclusion is strict, and Theorem [\ref=th:S(K)] sharpens Theorem [\ref=th:Paley].

As in Section [\ref=sec:totalize], we can extend this to Fourier coefficients of measures. We can also replace [formula] by a significantly smaller set, at the cost of using a larger constant in inequality ([\ref=eq:S((k_j))]). Let S((kj)) consist of all integers m with representations [\eqref=eq:epsilons] in which the coefficients εj' belong to the set { - 1,0,1} and satisfy the four conditions for membership of m in [formula]. Extend these notions to abelian groups.

Recall the definition of the set [formula] in Section [\ref=sec:totalize]. Clearly,

[formula]

We derive the following statement in the next section.

Let K be a subset of a discrete abelian group with dual G, and let μ be a regular Borel measure on G. If [formula] vanishes on [formula] for some enumeration (γj) of K, then

[formula]

The two theorems above were proved in the late 1970's in [\cite=FouArk] via a dual construction using the Schur algorithm. That method yielded inequalities ([\ref=eq:S((k_j))]) and ([\ref=eq:S_1(K)]) with the smaller constants [formula] and [formula]. The utility of the methods used in the present paper was understood by the early 1970's, however, so that the application in [\cite=FouArk] to half of the Littlewood conjecture for exponential sums could have been obtained about five years earlier.

The dual construction in [\cite=FouArk] led to another construction in [\cite=PS] and [\cite=Smith]. It is clear from the analysis in [\cite=Yudin] of the latter that it can also be used to prove Theorem [\ref=th:S(K)], with constant 2.

The sets [formula], Gj + 1 and Dj can also be described using suitable partial orders or preorders on Z that are compatible with addition. For each index j < J, let Pj' be the semigroup generated by the differences Δki' with i'  ≥  j. Write m  <  jn when n  -  m∈P'j, with no requirement that 0∉P'j. Then

[formula] if and only if m  <  jkj for some j.

m∈Gj + 1 if and only if m  <  j + 1kj + 1 or m  ≤  iki for some i  ≤  j.

m∈Dj if and only if m  <  j + 10 or m  ≤  iki  -  kj + 1 for some i  ≤  j.

In the second case in the description of Dj just above, write ki  -  kj + 1 as [formula]. It follows that the members of Dj are those with a representation [formula] with integer coefficients nj' having the following properties.

nj'  ≥  0 for all j'.

nj'  >  0 for some j'.

The set of indices j'  <  j for which nj'  ≠  0 has no gaps and contains j - 1 unless that set is empty.

The antinesting property of the sets Dj is then obvious.

So is the fact that each Dj is an additive semigroup. Define preorders by saying that m  <  *jn when m  -  n∈Dj. Rewrite conditions [\eqref=eq:kjInShiftedDj] to [\eqref=eq:imagenest] as follows.

The hypothesis in Theorem [\ref=th:S(K)] is that [formula] vanishes on the union of the sets Dj  +  kj, that is (n)  =  0 whenever there is some index j for which n  <  *jkj. To fit our proof of Paley's theorem in Section [\ref=sec:two-step] into this pattern, redefine the relation m  <  *j0 to mean that m  <   - kj for the usual order <   on [formula]; then Dj  +  kj is the usual negative cone in [formula], and the three conditions displayed above follow from strong lacunarity.

Direct Proof of Theorem [\ref=th:S_1(K)]

We work initially with stronger hypotheses.

Let K be a strongly lacunary set in a partially ordered discrete abelian group Γ, and let μ be a regular Borel measure on the dual of Γ. Enumerate K in increasing order by (γj). If [formula] vanishes on [formula], then

[formula]

It is enough to prove this when K is finite. Denote the group dual to Γ by G. The proof of Theorem [\ref=th:S(K)] applies to functions in L1(G) whose coefficients vanish on [formula]. The method in Section [\ref=sec:totalize] then yields inequality ([\ref=eq:MeasuresS_1(K)]) when [formula] vanishes on [formula].

Drop the order and lacunarity hypotheses, and enumerate K as {γj}Jj = 1. Form the product group [formula] and its dual [formula]. Totally order [formula] by declaring that [formula] when the last nonzero component of [formula] is positive. Let [formula] be the member of [formula] whose only nonzero component is a 1 in the j-th position. The set [formula] is extremely lacunary in the sense that, when j  <  J,

[formula]

Define a partial order on [formula] by declaring that

[formula]

Let [formula] be the set of of pairs [formula] with that enumeration. Note that if [formula], then γ∈S((γj)). Also, [formula] is extremely lacunary, so that each member of [formula] has at most one representation as a sum of members of [formula] multiplied by integers. The inclusion [\eqref=eq:S_in_SchurRiesz] is often strict, but the extreme lacunarity here makes

[formula]

Identify [formula] with the interval ( - π,π] with addition modulo 2π. Identify G with the subgroup G  ×  {0} of [formula]. Given a measure μ on G form a measure [formula] on [formula] by first transferring μ to G  ×  {0}, and then extending it to vanish outside that subgroup. Note that [formula], and that [formula] in all cases.

Suppose that [formula] vanishes on S((γj)). Then [formula] vanishes on [formula]. By equation [\eqref=eq:SimpleS(K)], Lemma [\ref=th:measures] applies to [formula], and yields that

[formula]
