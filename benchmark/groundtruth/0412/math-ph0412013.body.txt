A VERY BRIEF NOTE ON SOME COMMUTATIVE ALGEBRAIC PROPERTIES OF A DIRAC-FUETER MODIFIED EQUATION.

We consider the following differential operator of order 1:

[formula]

restricted to the quaternionic functions, that satisfy:

[formula]

Where u and v are real functions of a quaternionic variable. These functions satify the following properties:

P1. (4D NON-OBSERVABILITY) A solution that is quaternion inversible almost everywhere has a singularity of codimension at most 2, a singularity the set where the function is not a local diphemorphism.

P1. (3D OBSERVABILITY) A solution whose singularity has codimension 2 will separate the imaginary space in n connected components. P1.1. (TOPOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION) The number n above defined is a topological invariant.

P2. (3D RADIAL SYMMETRY): A solution is radially symmetric when restricted to the imaginary quaternionic space, isomorph to R3.

P3. (4D INVARIANCE): Solutions are invariant under quaternionic automorphisms.

P4. (ALGEBRAIC QUATERNIONIC CLOSEDNESS) Two solutions commute as quaternions. The sum and quaternionic product of two solutions is again a solution. The if the solution is locally algebraic inversible at some point then the algebraic inverse function is a solution.

P5. (SEPARATION OF GLOBAL FUNCTIONS) A solution defined on the whole quaternions without the origin is either a local diphemorphism almost everywhere or its totally degenerate in this sense.

P6. (QUIRAL CAUCHY-RIEMANN EQUATIONS) It is always possible to find a local parametrization based on 4 real variables variables, denoted as t ,r ,α, β such that the function will satisfy the following 4 differential equations:

[formula]

and the following subproperty:

P4* If [formula] then f is not locally invertible.

P4** If [formula] then f is locally invertible unless constants.

Thus the solutions are a commutative ring with quaternionic product and topological non-inversible solutions, where the commutative algebra machinery of localization seems natural to apply as the localization is not trivial. Quirality is obtained once we consider left and right versions of this operator.
