The gluon Sivers distribution in D production at RHIC

Parton distribution and fragmentation functions are phenomenological quantities which have to be obtained from experimental observation and cannot be theoretically predicted. When parton intrinsic transverse momenta are taken into account, a large number of pdf's and ff's arise: the main difficulties in gathering experimental information on these spin and [formula] dependent functions is that most often more of them contribute to the same physical observable, making it extremely hard to estimate each single one separately. The Sivers function [formula] [\cite=siv], which describes the probability density of finding unpolarized partons inside a transversely polarized proton, is one of these functions. It plays a crucial role since it can explain single spin asymmetries in terms of parton dynamics [\cite=noi1].

We suggest here an experiment to be conducted at RHIC which can isolate the gluon Sivers effect, making it possible to reach direct independent information on the gluon Sivers distribution function [formula]. A full description can be found in a detailed recently published paper [\cite=D-paper].

Let us consider the single spin asymmetry [formula] for [formula] processes at RHIC energy, [formula] GeV. These D mesons originate from c or [formula] quarks, which at LO can be created either via a q annihilation, q  →  c, or via a gluon fusion process, gg  →  c. The elementary cross section for the fusion process is much larger than the q  →  c cross section. Therefore, the gluon fusion dominates the whole [formula] process, up to xF≃0.6. In Fig. [\ref=unp-sigma](a) we show the unpolarized cross section for the process p  p  →  DX at [formula] GeV as a function of both the heavy meson energy ED and its transverse momentum pT, at fixed pseudo-rapidity η  =  3.8. In Fig. [\ref=unp-sigma](b) the same total cross section is presented as a function of xF at fixed pT  =  1.5 GeV/c. The dashed and dotted lines correspond to the q  →  c and gg  →  c contributions respectively. These plots clearly show the striking dominance of the gg  →  c channel over most of the ED and xF ranges covered by RHIC kinematics.

As the gluons cannot carry any transverse spin, the elementary process gg  →  c results in unpolarized final quarks. In the q  →  c process one of the initial partons can be polarized; however, at lowest order there is no single spin transfer in this s-channel interaction so that the final c and [formula] are again not polarized. Consequently, the charmed quarks fragmenting into the observed D mesons cannot be polarized, and there cannot be any Collins fragmentation effect.

Therefore, transverse single spin asymmetries in [formula] can only be generated by the Sivers mechanism, namely a spin-[formula] asymmetry in the distribution of the unpolarized quarks and gluons inside the polarized proton, coupled to the unpolarized interaction process q  →  c and dominantly gg  →  c, and the unpolarized fragmentation function of either the c or the [formula] quark into the final observed D meson. Detailed formulae for the AN generated by the Sivers effect can be found in a recent paper by U. D'Alesio and F. Murgia [\cite=unp].

The Sivers distribution functions [\cite=siv] for quarks and gluons are defined by

[formula]

where a can either be a light quark or a gluon.

Here, we consider intrinsic transverse motions in the distributions of initial light quarks, in the elementary process and in the heavy quark fragmentation function, i.e. we consider a fully non planar configuration for the partonic scattering. This has two main consequences: on one side, taking into account three intrinsic transverse momenta makes the kinematics highly non trivial; on the other side it generates a large number of contributions, other than the Sivers effect, which originate from all possible combinations of [formula] dependent distribution and fragmentation functions, each weighted by a phase factor. This is a crucial topic, extensively discussed by U. D'Alesio in these proceedings and in a paper dedicated to the suppression of Collins and other effects in proton-proton scattering [\cite=noi3]. We have explicitely verified that all contributions to the [formula] single spin asymmetry from [formula] dependent pdf's and ff's, aside from those of the Sivers functions, are multiplied by phase factors which make the integrals over the transverse momenta either negligibly small or identically zero.

In the previous literature, analyses of single spin asymmetry data were performed under the assumption [formula]. RHIC data on AN in [formula] will enable us to test the validity of this assumption. In fact, as the gg  →  c elementary scattering largely dominates the process up to xF≃0.6 (see Fig. 1), any sizeable single spin asymmetry measured in [formula] at moderate xF's would be the direct consequence of a non zero contribution of [formula].

Since we have no information about the gluon Sivers function, we consider two opposite extreme scenarios: the first being the case in which the gluon Sivers function is set to zero, [formula], and the quark Sivers function [formula] is taken to be at its maximum allowed value at any xa; the second given by the opposite situation, where [formula] and [formula] is maximized in xa.

Fig. [\ref=A-N] shows our estimates for the maximum value of the single spin asymmetry in [formula]. The dashed line shows |AN| when the quark Sivers function is set to its maximum, i.e. [formula], while setting the gluon Sivers function to zero. Clearly, the quark contribution to AN is very small over most of the kinematic region, in both cases (a) and (b). The dotted line corresponds to the SSA one finds in the opposite situation, when [formula] and [formula]: here the asymmetry presents a sizeable maximum in the central ED and positive xF energy region. This particular shape is given by the azimuthal dependence of the numerator of AN [\cite=D-paper].

By looking at Fig. [\ref=A-N] it is natural to conclude that any sizeable single transverse spin asymmetry measured by STAR or PHENIX experiments at RHIC in the region ED  ≤  60 GeV or - 0.2  ≤  xF  ≤  0.6, would give direct information on the size and importance of the gluon Sivers function.
