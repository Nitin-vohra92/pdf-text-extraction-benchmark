Via Aristotle, Leibniz & Mach to a relativistic relational gravity

Introduction

A brief history of ideas of space and time

The conception of space as the container of material objects is generally considered to have originated with Democritus and, for him, it provided the stage upon which material things play out their existence - emptiness exists and is that which is devoid of the attribute of extendedness (although, interestingly, this latter conception seems to contain elements of the opposite view upon which we shall comment later). For Newton [\cite=key-90], an extension of the Democritian conception was basic to his mechanics and, for him:

... absolute space, by its own nature and irrespective of anything external, always remains immovable and similar to itself.

Thus, the absolute space of Newton was, like that of Democritus, the stage upon which material things play out their existence - it had an objective existence for Newton and was primary to the order of things. In a similar way, time - universal time, an absolute time which is the same everywhere - was also considered to possess an objective existence, independently of space and independently of all the things contained within space. The fusion of these two conceptions provided Newton with the reference system - spatial coordinates defined at a particular time - by means of which, as Newton saw it, all motions could be quantified in a way which was completely independent of the objects concerned. It is in this latter sense that the Newtonian conception seems to depart fundamentally from that of Democritus - if emptiness exists and is devoid of the attribute of extendedness then, in modern terms, the emptiness of Democritus can have no metric associated with it. But it is precisely Newton's belief in absolute space & time (with the implied virtual clocks and rods) that makes the Newtonian conception a direct antecedant of Minkowski spacetime - that is, of an empty space and time within which it is possible to have an internally consistent discussion of the notion of metric.

The contrary view is generally considered to have originated with Aristotle [\cite=key-107] [\cite=key-89] for whom there was no such thing as a void - there was only the plenum within which the concept of the empty place was meaningless and, in this, Aristotle and Leibniz [\cite=key-85] were at one. It fell to Leibniz, however, to take a crucial step beyond the Aristotolian conception: in the debate of Clarke-Leibniz (1715~  1716) [\cite=key-84] in which Clarke argued for Newton's conception, Leibniz made three arguments of which the second was:

Motion and position are real and detectable only in relation to other objects ... therefore empty space, a void, and so space itself is an unnecessary hypothesis.

That is, Leibniz introduced a relational concept into the Aristotolian world view - what we call space is a projection of relationships between material bodies into the perceived world whilst what we call time is the projection of ordered change into the perceived world. Of the three arguments, this latter was the only one to which Clarke had a good objection - essentially that accelerated motion, unlike uniform motion, can be percieved without reference to external bodies and is therefore, he argued, necessarily percieved with respect to the absolute space of Newton. It is of interest to note, however, that in rebutting this particular argument of Leibniz, Clarke, in the last letter of the correspondence, put his finger directly upon one of the crucial consequences of a relational theory which Leibniz had apparently not realized (but which Mach much later would) stating as absurd that:

... the parts of a circulating body (suppose the sun) would lose the vis centrifuga arising from their circular motion if all the extrinsic matter around them were annihilated.

This letter was sent on October 29th 1716 and Leibniz died on November 14th 1716 so that we were never to know what Leibniz's response might have been.

Notwithstanding Leibniz's arguments against the Newtonian conception, nor Berkeley's contemporary criticisms [\cite=key-86], which were very similar to those of Leibniz and are the direct antecedants of Mach's, the practical success of the Newtonian prescription subdued any serious interest in the matter for the next 150 years or so until Mach himself picked up the torch. In effect, he answered Clarke's response to Leibniz's second argument by suggesting that the inertia of bodies is somehow induced within them by the large-scale distribution of material in the universe:

... I have remained to the present day the only one who insists upon referring the law of inertia to the earth and, in the case of motions of great spatial and temporal extent, to the fixed stars ... [\cite=key-78]

thereby generalizing Leibniz's conception of a relational universe. Mach was equally clear in expressing his views about the nature of time: in effect, he viewed time (specifically Newton's absolute time) as a meaningless abstraction. All that we can ever do, he argued in [\cite=key-78], is to measure change within one system against change in a second system which has been defined as the standard (eg it takes half of one complete rotation of the earth about its own axis to walk thirty miles).

Whilst Mach was clear about the origins of inertia (in the fixed stars), he did not hypothesize any mechanism by which this conviction might be realized and it fell to others to make the attempt - a typical (although incomplete) list might include the names of Einstein [\cite=key-87], Sciama [\cite=key-83], Hoyle & Narlikar and Sachs [\cite=key-81] [\cite=key-82] for approaches based on canonical ideas of spacetime, and the names of Ghosh [\cite=key-80] and Assis [\cite=key-79] for approaches based on quasi-Newtonian ideas.

It is perhaps one of the great ironies of 20thC science that Einstein, having coined the name Mach's Principle for Mach's original suggestion and setting out to find a theory which satisfied the newly named Principle, should end up with a theory which, whilst albiet enormously successful, is more an heir to the ideas of Democritus and Newton than to the ideas of Aristotle and Leibniz. One only has to consider the special case solution of Minkowski spacetime, which is empty but metrical, to appreciate this fact.

From Leibniz to inertia as a relational property

In our original paper on this topic [\cite=key-3], we took the general position of Leibniz, about the relational nature of space, to be self-evident and considered the question of metric within this general conceptualization. Briefly, we began by constructing a model universe populated by elementary particles whose only property was that of countability. We were then able to arrive at a theory within which a metrical three-space (generally non-Euclidean) is projected as a secondary construct out of the relationships which hold within the primary universal distribution of elementary material. The question of how time arose within the theory is particularly interesting: the simple requirement that time should be defined within the theory in such a way that Newton's Third Law was automatically satisfied had the direct consequence that time became an explicit measure of change within the system, very much as anticipated by Mach. The overall result was a quasi-classical (one-clock) theory of relational gravitation within which:

conditions of global dynamical equilibrium (that is, everywhere inertial) held if the elementary material was distributed fractally, D = 2;

point-source perturbations of the D = 2 distribution recovered the usual Newtonian prescriptions for gravitational effects;

cylindrically symmetric perturbations of the D = 2 distribution, used as rudimentary models of spiral galaxies and applied to model the dynamics of low surface brightness galaxies [\cite=key-12], gave results which were directly comparable in quality to those obtained from Milgrom's MOND algorithm [\cite=key-61] [\cite=key-62] [\cite=key-63] - and far superior to anything achieved by the multi-parameter CDM models.

The first of these three points refers to the universe that Leibniz was effectively considering in his debate with Clarke of 1715~  1716 - one within which inertial effects play no part. The second and third refer to the universe that Clarke used to refute Liebniz's second argument, and the one that Mach had in mind - the universe of rotations and accelerations. Thus, given our original Leibnizian worldview, we see that inertial effects themselves have their fundamental source in changed material relationships - they, too, are relational in nature.

A modern Le Sage theory

An unforeseen consequence of the approach of [\cite=key-3] was that the distribution of elementary material from which the D = 2 equilibrium universe was constructed turned out to have properties more properly associated with ideas of a material vacuum rather than a distribution of ordinary material as we conventionally understand it.

To be specific, each of the particles in the equilibrium universe has an arbitrarily directed psuedo-velocity property associated with it, the magnitude of which is a global constant (the same for every particle). However, this psuedo-velocity property is not a velocity in the conventional sense, but is more accurately thought of as being a conversion factor from length scales to time scales - very much like Bondi's interpretation of c, the light speed. Thus, one can can think of the matter distribution in the equilibrium universe as similar to a photon gas with the Bondian complexity that this 'gas' arbitrates between length scales and time scales - within the context of the theory, this is a direct consequence of the fact that time arises automatically as a measure of change within the particle distribution very much as Mach conceived it.

Gravitational processes within this universe arise when the D = 2 equilibrium distribution of the material vacuum is disturbed by discrete distributions of ordinary material. Although the theory is cauched in terms of a conventional metric description with equations of motion arising in the canonical fashion from a variational principle, it can also be thought of as a modern Le Sage-type theory [\cite=key-75] (in French, but see also Aronson [\cite=key-76] for a discussion in English ) - that is, as a pushing gravity theory within which gravitational effects arise as a consequence of momentum transfer between the ever-moving particles of the vacuum gas and ordinary ponderable material. A modern review of the history of such theories can be found in [\cite=key-94].

The property of inertia itself (resistance to change in motion) can be understood in the same way so that obvious similarities with the ideas of Haisch, Rueda [\cite=key-91] and Haisch, Rueda & Puthoff [\cite=key-92] (concerning the origin of inertia in the electromagnetic zero-point field) can be discerned.

The relativistic generalization

The basic purpose of this paper is to show how our Leibnizian worldview of a relational universe can be generalized to the case of relativistic gravitation. Surprisingly, we are able to show that, for the general N-body case, linear momentum is exactly conserved and, in the particular case of modelling point-source gravitation, the resulting model is shown to:

pass all of the standard local tests;

have the usual one-way event horizon at the usual Schwarzschild radius, R = RS say;

have no singularity at R = 0 - instead, what happens is that inside some boundary R = R0 < RS gravitation reverses its signature so that, once a particle crosses the black-hole boundary R = RS then it orbits in an oscillatory fashion about the interior R = R0 boundary;

be explicity without dipole radiation.

The general argument

In order to understand, in particular, how linear momentum is conserved for the N-body case, it is useful to repeat, in a much-compacted and simplified form, the general argument of [\cite=key-3] modified to account for the relativistic generalization.

Following in the tradition of Aristotle, Leibniz, Berkeley and Mach we argue that no consistent cosmology should admit the possibility of an internally consistent discussion of empty metrical space & time - unlike, for example, General Relativity which has the empty spacetime of Minkowski as a particular solution. Recognizing that the most simple space & time to visualize is one which is everywhere inertial, then our worldview was distilled into the question:

Is it possible to conceive a globally inertial space & time which is irreducibly associated with a non-trivial global mass distribution and, if so, what are the properties of this distribution?

The primary step taken in answer to the question was the recognition that, on large enough scales in the universe of our experience (say > 30  Mpc), the amount of matter in a given spherical volume in a given epoch can be considered as a well-defined (monotonic) function of the sphere's radius.

It follows immediately that, within the universe of our experience, we can choose to define the radius of any given sphere at any given epoch in terms of the amount of material contained within it.

We now use this idea to construct a rudimentary model universe which is isotropic at all points (so that rotational invariance can be assumed everywhere), is populated entirely by identical particles having only the property of countability and within which the radius of any spherical volume at any given time is defined in terms of the amount of mass contained within the volume:

[formula]

where N is the number of particles concerned, m0 is a scaling constant having dimensions of mass and f is an arbitrary monotonic increasing function of N. In this way, we have immediately defined one particular invariant linear measurement (a radial one) such that it becomes undefined in the absence of matter - in effect, we have provided an uncalibrated metric (since f is undefined) which follows Leibniz in the required sense for any displacement which is purely radial.

We now look for ways of generalizing this idea so that we can assign a metric to arbitrary displacements within the model universe. To this end, we consider the first of ([\ref=eqn0]) to be primary and then invert it to give the uncalibrated mass model,

[formula]

of our rudimentary model universe (here, [formula]). Note that we make no assumptions about the relation of the spatial coordinates, (x1,x2,x3), to the radial displacement, R. Now consider the normal gradient vector [formula] (for which choice a detailed physical argument is given in [\cite=key-3]) and the change in this arising from a displacement dxk,

[formula]

where we assume that the geometrical connections required to give this latter expression an unambiguous meaning are the usual metrical connections - except of course, the metric tensor gab is not yet defined.

Given that [formula] is nonsingular, then ([\ref=eqn0A]) provides a 1:1 mapping between the contravariant vector dxa and the covariant vector dna so that, in the absence of any other definition, we can define dna to be the covariant form of dxa. In this latter case the metric tensor automatically becomes [formula] which, through the implied metrical connections, is a highly non-linear equation defining gab to within the specification of [formula]. Note that, at this stage, [formula] is assumed to be arbitrary (beyond the basic requirement of monotonicity) which is equivalent to saying that the linear scale is uncalibrated. Thus, assuming the usual weak equivalence principle which requires that the action

[formula]

is minimized for gravitational trajectories, then:

the equations of motion will be invariant under arbitrary (monotonic) transformations of the linear scale up to, but not including, the specification of [formula].

We now ask what form [formula] must have so that flat spacetime, gab  =  γab, is recovered. The question is trivially answered giving

[formula]

The corresponding result from the quasi-classical analysis of [\cite=key-3] (for the existence of Euclidean frames) was that (R) = R2, valid about any centre so that mass is distributed fractally with D = 2 in that case. In the present case, for which [formula], we can say that the mass distribution tends to become fractal, D = 2, when very large spatial scales are considered over very short time scales - that is, for ct <  < R.

Finally, we show, in appendix [\ref=app:The-Material-Vacuum], how this definition of (R,ct) can be considered as a classical model of a rudimentary material vacuum which, because it is associated with gab  =  γab, we call the Minkowski vacuum. Thus, on large enough distance scales and short enough temporal scales, the relativistic material vacuum also tends to fractal with D = 2.

Fractal D = 2 universe

The original quasi-classical theory states that the material vacuum of the equilibrium model is exactly fractal with D = 2, whilst the current relativistic theory states that it tends to this state on large enough spatial scales and short enough temporal scales. If one imagines that ordinary matter somehow 'condenses' out of the material vacuum (say by collision processes) then it follows that the distribution of ordinary material must be fractal-like with maximum fractal dimension D = 2 and where we could expect this latter figure to be closely approached in a 'maximally evolved' system.

The idea that the universe might, indeed, be fractal is an old one which can be traced to Charlier's conception of an hierarchical universe [\cite=key-5] [\cite=key-6] [\cite=key-7]. The contemporary debate was probably initiated by Pietronero in 1987 [\cite=key-98] and Coleman et al in 1988 [\cite=key-100] and, in recent years, several quantitative analyses of both pencil-beam and wide-angle surveys of galaxy distributions have been performed: three recent examples are give by Joyce et al [\cite=key-14] who analysed the CfA2-South catalogue to find fractal behaviour with D  =[formula]; Sylos Labini & Montuori [\cite=key-16] analysed the APM-Stromlo survey to find fractal behaviour with D  =[formula], whilst Sylos Labini et al [\cite=key-17] analysed the Perseus-Pisces survey to find fractal behaviour with D  =[formula]. There are many other papers of this nature in the literature all supporting the view that, out to about 50Mpc at least, galaxy distributions appear to be fractal with [formula]. This latter view is now widely accepted (for example, see Wu, Lahav & Rees [\cite=key-26]), and the open question has become whether or not there is a transition to homogeneity on some sufficiently large scale.

The argument has recently reduced to a question of statistics: basically, the proponents of the fractal view argue that the statistical tools (eg correlation function methods) widely used to analyse galaxy distributions by the proponents of the opposite view are deeply rooted in classical ideas of statistics and implicitly assume that the distributions from which samples are drawn are homogeneous in the first place. Thus, much effort is being expended developing tools appropriate to analysing samples drawn from more general classes of populations - a general focus being the idea that one should not discuss fractal structures in terms of the correlation amplitude since the only meaningful quantity is the exponent characterizing the fractal behaviour. Recent papers arguing this general point of view are Sylos Labini & Gabrielli [\cite=key-105] and Gabrielli & Sylos Labini [\cite=key-106].

According to the present theory, the debate should be settled in favour of the globally fractal universe, D = 2.

The emergence of gravitation

It was shown in [\cite=key-12] how Newtonian gravitation emerges as a spherical perturbation of the equilibrium background, and a similar result is true here, as we shall show in detail from §[\ref=sec:The-emergence-of] onwards. Thus, for example, we suppose that a spherically symmetric distribution of ponderable material can be represented as a spherically symmetric disturbance of the vacuum so that, if [formula] represents the undisturbed vacuum, then

[formula]

represents the disturbed vacuum and

[formula]

gives the metric tensor in this disturbed vacuum.

Linear momentum conservation within the formalism

Suppose that we have a finite ensemble of ponderable mass particles, all having non-relativtistic velocities, embedded in the D = 2 equilibrium background. Then, we can suppose that all discussion of momentum conservation can be referred to the mass centre of the ensemble, and that this mass centre is in dynamic equilibrium with the background.

For any system of particles of masses M1,...,MN, described from a centre-of-mass frame, the integrated Newtonian momentum-conservation equation becomes

[formula]

The masses appearing in this equation are now arbitrarily partitioned into the pair of ensembles M1,...,Mk - 1 and Mk,...,MN. Defining the mass of the whole system as M, and the mass of the ensemble M1,...,Mk - 1 as m, then the foregoing equation can be written as

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] are the respective mass-centres of the two, arbitrarily defined, particle ensembles defined with respect to the mass centre of the whole ensemble. Any interaction can then be considered as being between the particle ensemble of mass m and the rest of the ensemble, having mass M - m. Whatever the details of this interaction, these two particle ensembles must, together, evolve from their initial state in such a way that linear momentum is conserved for all t > 0 so that, always,

[formula]

But, it is easily shown that, for unspecified M, the equations of motion arising from ([\ref=eqn3]) are scale-invariant under the light-cone preserving transformation   =  λ,  t = λT for non-zero constant λ; in particular, this is true for the λ value defined at ([\ref=GMC]). It follows that the equations of motion for [formula] and t will transform into identical equations of motion for λ and λT so that, with the initial condition (0) = λ(0), the calculated trajectories will satisfy   =  λ for all time. That is, linear momentum is exactly conserved within the formalism.

Point-source disturbances in the Minkowski vacuum

In the following, a point-mass gravitating source is represented as a spherically symmetric point-source disturbance of the Minkowski vacuum and, in appendix [\ref=appA], we show that a first-order approximation to such a disturbance has the structure

[formula]

where H is a twice-differentiable function. Following the details of appendix [\ref=appA], we find that the corresponding perturbed metric is given by

[formula]

Expanding this expression, forming the corresponding proper-time element, and transforming to spherical polar coordinates we obtain, as detailed in appendix [\ref=appB],

[formula]

The Δ0 component represents the infinitessimal proper-time registered by a test-particle moving in the undisturbed Minkowski vacuum, whilst Δ1 and Δ2 describe the perturbation of this proper-time element caused by the point-source.

The integrated effect of many disturbances

Now suppose that the disturbance which gives rise to ([\ref=eqn5]) is simply one of a continual train of identical disturbances passing through the particle with a regular frequency measured in the rest-frame of the source (the source is considered as an oscillator), then we can replace [formula], [formula] and H by their mean-values between successive minima in the train of disturbances, and redefine dτ2 of ([\ref=eqn5]) as a measure of the mean proper-time registered by the test-particle between these successive minima. With this understanding, and writing the mean-value of [formula] as λ, then, to O(1 / R), a spherically symmetric disturbance in the Minkowski vacuum passing through the test-particle causes the particle to register a mean infinitessimal proper-time, given by

[formula]

measured over the interval for which the disturbance can be said to be passing through the particle. Now, since the integrated magnitude of the deviation of the disturbed proper-time from the undisturbed proper-time, measured over any finite interval, will depend on the frequency with which the disturbances arrive at the test-particle then we can deduce that the undetermined parameter λ must be a measure of the frequency, and hence rest-mass, of the disturbing source. Consequently, λ  =  βM0, for constant β and rest-mass M0, and the proper-time element ([\ref=eqn5A]) is now reduced to the general form of that arising in any conventional metric-gravitation theory.

Finally, we notice that the general form of ([\ref=eqn5A]) is identical to that of the Eddington form of the Schwarzschild proper-time element and that the two forms match exactly if λ =  - 2γM0 / c2; consequently, under the transformation,

[formula]

then

[formula]

and this form is identical to the Schwarzschild proper-time element, as required.

Black holes without singularities

The proper-time element, ([\ref=eqn5]), is only fully determined when the neglected [formula] and H / R3 terms are included. It transpires that their presence removes the essential singularity at R = 0 in the line element.

In the previous section, we defined λ as the mean value of [formula] between successive minima in the train of vacuum disturbances generated by the central massive source. If we now define α and β, in a similar way, as the corresponding mean values of [formula] and H, and make the definitions

[formula]

then the full line element, given at ([\ref=eqn5]), leads fairly easily to the equations of motion

[formula]

so that the radial velocity equation is given by

[formula]

where the choice of signature '±  ' determines if radial motion is towards, or away from, the gravitating source. Note that α  =  β = 0 yields the corresponding GR equations.

In the previous section, we showed λ =  - 2γM / c2 so that the Schwarzschild radius is at Rs =  - λ. Consequently, from the definition of X, we see that X = 0 in ([\ref=eqn6]) on the Schwarzschild boundary, and an analysis of the equation in the region of this boundary shows that test-particles can cross it when inward-bound (signature choice is '-  '), but cannot cross it when outward bound (signature choice is '+  '). In this sense, of course, the presented theory is in direct accord with the GR model.

The real differences between the presented theory and GR emerge when the radial equation ([\ref=eqn6]) is analysed in the limit of [formula]. Specifically, we find

[formula]

so that, as an immediate consequence,

[formula]

which implies that gravitational attraction 'turns off' at some R = R* for 0 < R* < Rs, and becomes gravitational repulsion in the region 0 < R < R*. The origin, R = 0, is a point of unstable equilibrium, and so can be considered as the top of a 'potential hill'. Consequently, the essential singularity which exists in the GR model at R = 0 does not exist in the perturbed Minkowski vacuum model.

The absence of dipole effects

We have already noted that linear momentum is exactly conserved within the formalism (at least for non-relativistic systems) so that there can be no dipole effects arising from the non-conservation of linear momentum. In the following, we show that dipole radiation in general is explicitly absent from the theory in its radiation model interpretation.

We begin by noting that the far-field solution of any gravitationally radiating binary system will necessarily be spherically symmetric. Consequently, if we wish to determine whether or not dipole radiation exists at all according to the theory, then it is sufficient to investigate the general radiation solution for the spherically symmetric case up to its lowest order multipole. The details of this analysis are given in appendices [\ref=appA] and [\ref=appC] where it is found that

[formula]

where N > 2 so that dipole terms are explicitly excluded from the general multipole solution. The corresponding metric is then found by using the relationship

[formula]

Conclusions

Using a view of the universe that can be traced to Aristotle, via Mach, Liebniz and Berkeley we have arrived at a relativistic theory of relational gravity which, apart from satisfying all the standard local tests, conserves linear momentum exactly in a slow moving N-body system and is explicitly free of any dipole gravitational radiation component. We can therefore expect that it will be 'good' for the binary pulsar tests also (eg Will [\cite=4]). Furthermore, the theory predicts the existence of blackholes with the usual Schwarzschild radius but without the essential singularities that exist in canonical theory.

The Material Vacuum

It is easily shown that

[formula]

for an arbitrary origin xi0 which satisfies Δ0 > 0 gives rise directly, via ([\ref=eqn3]), to gab  =  γab. A natural generalization of M(0), obtained by summing over all possible origins, is given by

[formula]

where α(x10,x20,x30,x40) is such that M(0) also gives gab  =  γab when put into ([\ref=eqn3]).

An understanding of the meaning of this M(0) can be had by considering the expanding surface

[formula]

for k some real constant, generated by a single term of ([\ref=eqn.Matvac3]). It is easily shown that the radial speed of such an expanding surface increases from 0 to c on the range |k|  ≤  |  -  0| <   ∞  . It follows that M(0), which is defined by ([\ref=eqn.Matvac3]) at the spacetime point (,ct) by summing over all admissible origins (0,ct0), is a sum over an infinity of instantaneously intersecting surfaces expanding from all possible directions and at all possible subluminal speeds. In this way, we generate a classical image of a continually fluctuating relativistically invariant material vacuum. Consequently, ([\ref=eqn.Matvac3]) can be interpreted as a rudimentary model of a classical fluctuating material vacuum.

Details of the Monopole Approximation

In this appendix we give the details of the algebra leading up to ([\ref=eqn5]). Defining the parameter [formula] where R2 = (x1)2 + (x2)2 + (x3)2, and using the notation x0 = ct, then we find

[formula]

where

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Now consider a particle, having coordinates (xa) relative to the spatial origin, being displaced to (xa + dxa). The corresponding proper-time element for this displacement is given by

[formula]

so that, using ([\ref=eqn19]), we find

[formula]

Using the spherical polar coordinate transformations x1 = R cos φ, x2 = R sin φ, [formula] and x0 = ct, then this expression can be written as

[formula]

for the result.

Multi-pole disturbances in the vacuum

The general formalism is given by

[formula]

where

[formula]

and the Minkowski vacuum is given by

[formula]

We can write a perturbed solution as

[formula]

where [formula] is a disturbance of the Minkowski vacuum and εab is the corresponding perturbation of the metric-tensor. By writing

[formula]

then the formalism can be expressed as

[formula]

where

[formula]

Suppose we express ([\ref=eqn7]) and ([\ref=eqn8]) in the form

[formula]

where the summations converge uniformly to [formula] and εab respectively, then

[formula]

can be considered as an n-th order approximation to the exact solution and where, in this notation, M(0) represents the Minkowski vacuum and [formula]. The (n+1)-th order approximation

[formula]

can be generated from the n-th order approximation by implementing the following algorithm:- Use g(n)ab to define Δ(n)ab and [formula] from ([\ref=eqn9]) and ([\ref=eqn10]) respectively, and then use ([\ref=eqn12]) and ([\ref=eqn11]) with ([\ref=eqn15]) and ([\ref=eqn16]) to define the recursive relations

[formula]

Since M(0) represents the Minkowski vacuum and g(0)ab  =  γab by ([\ref=eqn13]) and ([\ref=eqn14]), then ([\ref=eqn17]) together with ([\ref=eqn18]) can be used to generate a sequence of successive approximations to the exact solution.

In particular, since it is easily shown that [formula], then it follows from ([\ref=eqn17]) that [formula]. Consequently, for a spherically symmetric disturbance, we find the retarded solution

[formula]

so that, as a first approximation, we have

[formula]

The Absence of Dipole Effects.

Putting n = 1 in ([\ref=eqn17]) leads to the equation for the second order approximation, and this is given by

[formula]

so that

[formula]

Our analysis proceeds in the following way:- by showing that the source term in this equation has the form of an octopole multiplied by a regular function, we are able to show that E(2) cannot be of lower order than a quadropole.

The analysis requires that we consider the explicit form of the operator [formula] which is the first order approximation of the general wave operator

[formula]

where

[formula]

This approximation is obtained using

[formula]

which, for small disturbances, implies

[formula]

where the disturbance is given by

[formula]

and satisfies

[formula]

Substitution of ([\ref=eqn22]) into the definition ([\ref=eqn21]) of [formula] gives

[formula]

where

[formula]

Consequently,

[formula]

where [formula] is the flat space-time wave operator. The second term on the right of this expression is identically zero; to see this, we first note that, by ([\ref=eqn26]), it contains the factor

[formula]

Using the definition ([\ref=eqn23]) of ε(1)ab, we find

[formula]

Using ([\ref=eqn24]) we immediately obtain

[formula]

A similar analysis of the remaining terms in the expression ([\ref=eqn28]) gives

[formula]

so that, finally,

[formula]

for the result.

We now consider the fourth term of ([\ref=eqn27]):- by ([\ref=eqn26]) this contains the factor

[formula]

By ([\ref=eqn19]) the first term of ([\ref=eqn29]) can be expressed as

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Use of the easily proven identities

[formula]

in this expression leads to

[formula]

where P4 denotes an octopole term. Similar analyses on the remaining two terms of ([\ref=eqn29]) then gives the result

[formula]

Thus, we can finally write

[formula]

so that ([\ref=eqn20]) can be written as

[formula]

[formula]

Putting n=0 in ([\ref=eqn17]) shows that the first two terms on the right side of this expression cancel, so let us now consider the third term:- From the first order solution we have

[formula]

so that, for the third term, we get

[formula]

Since γijε(1)ij = 0 by ([\ref=eqn24]), then we need only consider the quadratic term. Using ([\ref=eqn19]) and the relations ([\ref=eqn30]), we can easily show that this leads to the result

[formula]

Finally, we consider the fourth term on the right of ([\ref=eqn31]):- since the first order solution is given by

[formula]

where U(0) is a regular scalar function, then this final term of ([\ref=eqn31]) becomes

[formula]

Since Sk is a vector with regular components (see ([\ref=eqn19])), and U(0) is a regular scalar which is everywhere twice differentiable, then the first term in the brackets on the right of this expression is also a regular scalar function; use of the identities SkSk = 0 and SkRk = 1 then gives

[formula]

for some regular function G, and where P2 denotes a dipole term. Collecting these results gives, from ([\ref=eqn31]),

[formula]

Remembering that, according to ([\ref=eqn19]), ε(1)ab behaves as a monopole it is now simple to show that E(2) must have the general form

[formula]

Consequently, the second order approximation to the stellar model can be expressed as

[formula]

where N > 2, so that, according to the vacuum gravity formalism, dipole effects are absent in an arbitrarily defined spherically symmetric disturbance of the Minkowski vacuum.
