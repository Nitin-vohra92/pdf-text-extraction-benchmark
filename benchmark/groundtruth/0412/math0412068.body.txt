Some properties of non-compact complete Riemannian manifolds

Introduction

The motivation for this paper comes from the interest in the understanding the Ricci solitons [\cite=H95]. However, at this moment, almost all works in this direction are about Gradient Ricci Solitons. See [\cite=H95], [\cite=B04],[\cite=C96], and [\cite=M04]. Generally speaking, a non-compact Ricci soliton may not be a gradient Ricci soliton. So it may be interesting to consider problems related to Ricci solitons.

In this paper, we consider the volume growth properties of the non-compact complete Riemannian manifold (X,g) under a natural Ricci curvature condition. We can improve the volume growth theorem of Calabi [\cite=Ca75] and Yau [\cite=Y76]. Then we use our new result to study gradient Ricci soliton. We also show that on X, for any q∈(0,  ∞  ), every non-negative Lq subharmonic function is constant under a natural decay condition on the Ricci curvature.

Result about Gradient Solitons is stated in section four. In section two, we generalize the result of Calabi ([\cite=Ca75]) and Yau ([\cite=Y76]) on infinite volume property for Riemannian manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature. Calabi and Yau's result was generalized by Cheeger-Gromov-Taylor ( see Theorem 4.9 in [\cite=CGT82] ) to Riemannian manifolds with lower bound like

[formula]

for r(x) >  > 1 and some restricted dimensional constant νn, where Rc is the Ricci tensor of the metric g, and r(x) is the distance function from some fixed point x0. We can remove this restriction to the dimensional constant νn. Our result is

In section three. we give some remarks on Yau's gradient estimate and vanishing properties for subharmonic functions.

Proof of Theorem 1

We let D and R(.,.). be the the Levi-Civita derivative and Riemmnain curvature of the metric g respectively. Let x be a point which is inside the cut locus of p∈X. Let γ(t) be the geodesic from p to x. Choose a fixed point x0 in the curve γ. Let r = r(x) be the distance function to the fixed point x0∈X . For any Y∈TxX and [formula]. Then we can get an Jacobi field Ŷ by extending X along γ (see [\cite=CE75] or [\cite=Aub82]). Let Ir0(.,.) be the index form along γ. Then the hessian of r at x

[formula]

can be written as

[formula]

which is the index form Ir0(Ŷ,Ŷ). We now extend Y along γ and get a parallel vector field E. Then by the minimizing property of the index form Ir0 we have that

[formula]

and the right side of the above inequality is

[formula]

To compute the Laplacian Δr of r, we choose vector fields

[formula]

as an orthonormal basis of Tγ(t)X and parallel along γ. Then we have

[formula]

which is bounded above by

[formula]

Using the assumption that Rc  ≥  C(r) we get that

[formula]

Since

[formula]

we have

[formula]

Now it is standard to verify (see also page 7 in [\cite=SY94] or [\cite=CM03] ) that in the distributional sense, it holds on X

[formula]

Then it holds in the distributional sense that

[formula]

That is, for any non-negative function φ∈C∞0(X),

[formula]

We now follow the argument of Schoen and Yau (see [\cite=SY94]). By approximation, we can let φ in (1) be a Lipschitz function with compact support. Choose φ(x) = ξ(r(x)), where ξ(r) = 1 for r  ≤  R - 1, = 0 for r  ≥  R + 1, and [formula] for R - 1  ≤  r  ≤  R + 1. By direct computation we have

[formula]

Note that |Dr| = 1, then we get

[formula]

From this we clearly have,

[formula]

Note that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Then by (1) we have

[formula]

Since

[formula]

we obtain that

[formula]

This implies Theorem 1.

Remarks on harmonic functions

In his beautiful work [\cite=Y75], Yau proved that

We now use this gradient estimate to study the positive solution of the equation on the manifold X:

[formula]

where c  ≥  0 is a constant.

Let

[formula]

have the product metric, so that we still have Rc(N)  ≥   - (n - 1)K provided Rc(X)  ≥   - (n - 1)K. We write DN as the covariant derivative on N. Let

[formula]

Then

[formula]

By Yau's estimate we have that

[formula]

The important matter for us is the constant Cn independent of the constant c. This is an important thing for us to study the Ricci soliton.

We also need to study the positive solution of the following equation on the manifold X:

[formula]

where c  ≥  0 is a constant. Note that non-negative solutions to (3) are non-negative subharmonic functions. So we now use our Theorem 1 to study Lq non-negative subharmonic functions on complete Riemannian manifolds. As in the proof of Theorem 2.5 in [\cite=LS84], we have

Ricci soliton with Ricci curvature quadratic decay

In this section, we assume that the non-compact complete Reimannian manifold (X,g) is a gradient Ricci soliton, that is, there is a smooth function f such that

[formula]

on X. The classification for Ricci solitons is important to the research for Ricci flow, see [\cite=H95], [\cite=B04],[\cite=C96], [\cite=Ma04] and [\cite=M04]. Generally speaking, a non-compact Ricci soliton may not be a gradient Ricci soliton.

For a gradient Ricci soliton, as showed by R.Hamilton [\cite=H95], we have a constant M such that

[formula]

where s is the scalar curvature of G. We assume that f is not a constant, so X is not Ricci flat.

We now come to the question: Whether the constant M is bounded under a nice curvature condition?

From the definition of the gradient Ricci soliton, it is clear that

[formula]

Set

[formula]

which is a positive function on X. Then we have [\cite=M04] that

[formula]

If M is negative, then we can write it as M =  - c2, and then we can use the gradient estimate in Proposition 3. Note that

[formula]

Then in this case, we have the bound

[formula]

for every R > 0, provided Rc(X)  ≥   - (n - 1)K on the ball BR and

[formula]

If M = c2 for some constant c  ≥  0 , we can use our Proposition 4.

In conclusion we have

In fact we have two cases when (i) M  ≤  0 or (ii) M > 0. In case (i), we clearly have that

[formula]

The lower bound for R follows easily from the assumption that

[formula]

for r(x) large. By this we have s(x)  →  0 as r(x)  →    ∞  , and M = 0. In case (ii), u is a positive subharmonic function, amd we use Proposition 4 to get
