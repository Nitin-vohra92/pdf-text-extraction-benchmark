Generic Transfer from [formula] to [formula]

Introduction

Let k be a number field and let G denote the group [formula]. The (connected component of the) L-group of G is [formula] which has a natural embedding into [formula]. Langlands functoriality predicts that associated to this embedding there should be a transfer of automorphic representations of G to those of [formula] [\cite=arthur-gsp4]. Langlands' theory of Eisenstein series reduces the proof of this to unitary cuspidal automorphic representations. We establish functoriality for the generic spectrum of [formula]. More precisely, (cf. Theorem [\ref=main]) we prove:

Let π be a unitary cuspidal representation of [formula] which we assume to be globally generic. Then π has a unique transfer to an automorphic representation Π of [formula]. The transfer is generic (globally and locally) and satisfies ωΠ  =  ω2π and [formula]. Here, ωπ and ωΠ denote the central characters of π and Π, respectively.

Moreover, we give a cuspidality criterion for Π and prove that, when Π is not cuspidal, it is an isobaric sum of two unitary cuspidal representations of [formula] (cf. Proposition [\ref=cusp-cri]).

We give a number of applications of this result. The first one is Theorem [\ref=est] which gives estimates toward the generalized Ramanujan conjecture for generic representations of the group [formula] (cf. Section [\ref=ram-est]). We also prove in Theorem [\ref=weak] that any generic unitary cuspidal representation of [formula] is weakly Ramanujan (cf. Section [\ref=ram-weak] for definition). In Section [\ref=spinor] we use our main result to give an immediate proof that the spin L-function of a generic unitary cuspidal representation of [formula] is entire. This is due to the fact that the spin L-function of [formula] now becomes a standard L-function (or product of two such L-functions) of general linear groups. This fact has also been proved recently by R. Takloo-Bighash using different methods from ours.

We should note here that the transfer from [formula] to [formula] has been expected by experts in the field for a long time. It is our understanding that Jacquet, Piatetski-Shapiro, and Shalika knew how to prove this result, at least in principle, but, as far as we know, their result was never published. We should also point out that their proof is based on methods that are fairly disjoint from ours.

Our method of proof is to start with our earlier, more general but weaker, result on generic transfer from [formula] groups to [formula] (cf. [\cite=gspin]). This gives us the existence of Π. We then use results of Piatetski-Shapiro and Soudry on analytic properties of L-functions of [formula] twisted by [formula] and [formula] to get more information about the representation Π. It is exactly the lack of such results in the general case of [formula] groups that prevents us from carrying out our analysis for the more general case for now. However, as we pointed out in [\cite=gspin], there are currently two ways to overcome this problem. One is to prove an analogue of descent theory for these groups as was done for classical groups by Ginzburg, Rallis, and Soudry [\cite=grs] [\cite=sou]. The other is to use techniques along the lines of [\cite=kim1] [\cite=kim2].

The case of the transfer for all automorphic representations of [formula] (whether generic or not) requires Arthur's trace formula, whose process in this case and what the expected issues are, is outlined in [\cite=arthur-gsp4].

We would like to thank James Cogdell for many helpful discussions and Peter Sarnak for his interest in this work. The first author would also like to thank Steve Gelbart, Dihua Jiang, Robert Langlands, Brooks Roberts, and Ramin Takloo-Bighash for many helpful discussions during the course of this work.

Main Result

Let k be a number field and let [formula] denote its ring of adeles. We define the similitude symplectic group of degree four via

[formula]

where

[formula]

and [formula] is the similitude character. We fix the following parametrization of the elements of the maximal torus [formula] in [formula]:

[formula]

The above agrees with our previous more general notation for the group [formula] in [\cite=gspin]. Recall that the group [formula] is identified with [formula].

Let [formula] be a globally ψ-generic unitary cuspidal automorphic representation of [formula]. Here, [formula] is a non-trivial additive character of [formula] defining a character of the unipotent radical of the standard upper-triangular Borel in the usual way. We fix ψ now and do not repeat it in the rest of this paper. Let S be any non-empty finite set of non-archimedean places v which includes those v with πv or ψv ramified. We proved in [\cite=gspin] that there exists an automorphic representation [formula] of [formula] such that Πv is a local transfer of πv for v outside of S.

To be more explicit, assume that [formula]. If v is archimedean, then πv is given by a parameter [formula] where Wv is the Weil group of kv (cf. [\cite=langlands-real]). Let [formula] be given by [formula], where [formula] is the natural embedding. Then Φv is the parameter of Πv.

If [formula] is non-archimedean, then πv is the unique unramified subquotient of the representation induced from an unramified character χ of [formula] to [formula]. Writing

[formula]

where χi are unramified characters of k×v and ai∈k×v the representation Πv is then the unique irreducible unramified subquotient of the representation of [formula] parabolically induced from the character

[formula]

of [formula].

Moreover, we proved that ωΠ  =  ω2, where ω  =  ωπ and ωΠ denote the central characters of π and Π, respectively, and for [formula] we have [formula], i.e., Π is nearly equivalent to [formula].

The representation Π is equivalent to a subquotient of some representation

[formula]

where induction is from [formula] with [formula] to [formula] and σi are unitary cuspidal automorphic representation of [formula] and [formula].

Without loss of generality we may assume that [formula]. Moreover, since Π is unitary we have [formula] which implies that rt  ≤  0. Let [formula] and consider

[formula]

If nt = 1, then the left hand side is entire by a result of Piatetski-Shapiro (cf. page 274 of [\cite=ps-gsp4]). Now consider the right hand side at s0 = 1 - rt  ≥  1. The last term in the product has a pole at s0 while all the others are non-zero there since [formula]. This is a contradiction.

Now assume that nt = 3, i.e., t = 2 with n1 = 1 and n2 = 3. Replacing π and Π by their contragredients will change ri to - ri and takes us back to the above situation which gives a contradiction again.

Therefore, nt  =  2. In this case, the left hand side of ([\ref=partial]) may have a pole at s = 1 (cf. Theorem 1.3 of [\cite=ps-soudry] and beginning of its proof), and if so, arguing as above, we conclude that rt = 0. This means that we either have t = 2 with n1  =  n2  =  2 or t = 3 with n1  =  n2  =  1 and n2  =  2. However, we can rule out the latter as follows.

Assume that t = 3 with n1 = n2 = 1 and n2 = 2. Then, it follows from the fact that r3  =  0 and the conditions r1  ≥  r2  ≥  r3 and r1  +  r2  +  2r3  =  0 that all the ri would be zero in this case. This implies that if we consider the L-function of π twisted by [formula], we have

[formula]

Now the left hand side is again entire by Piatetski-Shapiro's result mentioned above and the right hand side has a pole at s = 1 which is a contradiction.

Therefore, the only possibilities are t = 1 (i.e., Π unitary cuspidal) or t = 2 and n1  =  n2  =  2 with r2  =  0. In the latter case we immediately get r1  =  0 as well since r1  +  r2  =  0 by unitarity of the central character. Moreover, in this case we have [formula] since, otherwise,

[formula]

must have a double pole at s = 1 while any possible pole of the left hand side at s = 1 is simple (cf. proof of Theorem 1.3 of [\cite=ps-soudry]).

Therefore, we have proved the following:

Let π be a globally generic unitary cuspidal automorphic representation of [formula] and let Π be any transfer of π to [formula]. Then, Π is a subquotient of an automorphic representation as in ([\ref=aut-ind]) with either t = 1, n1  =  4, and r1  =  0 (i.e., Π is unitary cuspidal) or t = 2, n1  =  n2  =  2 and r1  =  r2  =  0. In the latter case, we have [formula].

In fact, we can get more precise information.

Let π be a globally generic unitary cuspidal automorphic representation of [formula] with ω  =  ωπ its central character and let Π be any transfer as above. Then, [formula] (not just nearly equivalent).

The representation Π is cuspidal if and only if π is not obtained as a Weil lifting from [formula].

If Π is not cuspidal, then it is the isobaric sum of two representations [formula], where each Πi is a unitary cuspidal automorphic representation of [formula] satisfying [formula] and [formula].

By Proposition [\ref=ni2], Π is not cuspidal if and only if it is a subquotient of

[formula]

where σi are unitary cuspidal automorphic representation of [formula].

On the other hand, by Theorem 1.3 of [\cite=ps-soudry] mentioned above the representation π is obtained as a Weil lifting from [formula] if and only if there exists an automorphic representation τ of [formula] such that LT(s,π  ×  τ) has a pole and in that case τ can be normalized so that the pole occurs at s = 1.

Now assume that Π is cuspidal. Then, for any τ as above we have

[formula]

which is entire. Therefore, π is not obtained as a Weil lifting from [formula]. Moreover, since Π is cuspidal, so is [formula] and they are nearly equivalent, therefore, by strong multiplicity one theorem [\cite=jac-sha-classificationI] [\cite=jac-sha-classificationII] [\cite=ps-corvallis] we have [formula].

Next, assume that Π is not cuspidal and, hence, is given as a subquotient of Σ above. We claim that each [formula] is irreducible. To see this note that each σi,v in generic unitary and is either a tempered representation of [formula] or a complementary series I(χ| |å,χ| |-  α) with α∈(0,1 / 2) and χ a unitary character. If both of the σi,v's are tempered, then irreducibility of Σv is clear. If both are complementary series of the form I(χ1| |å,χ1| |-  α) and [formula] with α,β∈(0,1 / 2) and χi unitary characters, then for Σv to be reducible we should have α  ±  β  =    ±  1 which is not possible. Finally, if one of σi,v's is tempered and the other is complementary series, then we either have Σv  =  (χ| |-  α,χ1,χ2,χ| |å), Σv  =  (χ| |-  α,Q(χ1| |- 1 / 2,χ1| |1 / 2),χ| |å), or Σv  =  (χ| |-  α,η,χ| |å). Here, χ1,χ are unitary characters, α∈(0,1 / 2), η is a unitary supercuspidal representation of [formula], and Q(χ1| |- 1 / 2,χ1| |1 / 2) denotes the Steinberg representation twisted by the unitary character χ1. Again, in all these cases the representation Σv is irreducible since α∈(0,1 / 2).

Therefore, at every place v the representation Πv is the same as the irreducible Σv and, hence, it is the Langlands quotient. This means that Π is an isobaric representation, i.e., the isobaric sum of σ1 and σ2. Again by strong multiplicity one theorem, which remains valid for isobaric representations [\cite=jac-ps-shalika], we conclude that [formula]. Now, just take Πi to be σi.

Finally, by Proposition 7.4 of [\cite=gspin], which was based on classification theorems of Jacquet and Shalika, we know that we either have [formula] for i = 1,2 or we have [formula] (or equivalently, [formula]). However, the latter case will not occur when π is cuspidal and generic since, otherwise, π will be nearly equivalent to an Eisenstein series representation, i.e., π will be a CAP representation of [formula]. This is impossible by Theorem 1.1 of [\cite=ps-soudry-five]. This completes the proof.

Notice that any other transfer [formula] of π is also a subquotient of Σ in ([\ref=Sigma]) which is irreducible. Therefore, π has a unique transfer to [formula] which we continue to denote by Π. In particular, this implies that we have not lost any information at the places where we did not have a natural candidate for the local transfer.

Moreover, since Π is either a unitary cuspidal representation of a general linear group or an isobaric sum of two such, every local representation Πv is full induced and generic.

Furthermore, if Π is not cuspidal, then [formula] implies that [formula] has no pole at s = 1. This implies that the Fourier coefficient of Π along the unipotent radical of our fixed Borel is non-vanishing, i.e., Π is globally generic [\cite=shahidi81AMJ].

We collect the above results in the following theorem which is our main result.

Let π be a globally generic unitary cuspidal automorphic representation of [formula] with central character ω. Then π has a unique transfer Π to [formula] which satisfies [formula] and its central character is ω2. Moreover, Π is either unitary cuspidal or an isobaric sum [formula] of two inequivalent unitary cuspidal automorphic representations of [formula] satisfying [formula]. The latter is the case if and only if π is obtained as a Weil lifting from [formula]. Furthermore, Π is globally generic, i.e., it has a non-vanishing Fourier coefficient along the unipotent radical of our fixed Borel subgroup.

In fact, we can get more information about the local representations at places v∈S.

Fix v∈S and let

[formula]

be an irreducible generic representation of [formula], where each πi,v is a tempered representation of some [formula], [formula], and π0,v is a tempered generic representation of some [formula]. (Note that there are very few possibilities for ni's and m since [formula]. We are allowing m = 0 and, by convention, [formula]. ) Let ωv denote the central character of πv. Assume that πv is the local component of the globally generic unitary cuspidal representation π of [formula] and let Π be its transfer to [formula]. Then the local component Πv of Π at v is generic and of the form

[formula]

where, Π0,v is a tempered generic representation of [formula] if m  >  0.

Let us remark that, as in Section 7 of [\cite=ckpss-classical], one could define the notion of local transfer and obtain complete information about such transfers for a general irreducible admissible generic representation, whether a local component of a global representation or not. (In fact, the representation Π0,v would then be the local transfer of π0,v.) However, we do not need the full extent of such results in this paper.

Recall that we already proved (cf. Remark [\ref=unique]) that each Πv is generic and is full induced.

Let v∈S and consider πv and Πv as in the proposition. We first show that if ρv is any supercuspidal representation of [formula], then

[formula]

The key here is the fact that there exists a unitary cuspidal representation ρ of [formula] such that its local component at v is ρv and at all other finite places [formula] the local component ρw is unramified (cf. Proposition 5.1 of [\cite=shahidi:90annals]). Now applying converse theorem of Cogdell and Piatetski-Shapiro with [formula] will give the result exactly as in the proof of Proposition 7.2 of [\cite=ckpss-classical]. Moreover, by multiplicativity of γ-factors, we conclude that ([\ref=gamma]) also holds if ρv is a discrete series representation of [formula].

Next, we claim that if πv is tempered, then so is Πv. Here, again the main tool is multiplicativity of γ-factors and the proof is exactly as in Lemma 7.1 of [\cite=ckpss-classical]. This proves the proposition for the case m = 2. If m = 1, then the group [formula] is the same as [formula] and we set Π0,v to be π0,v itself. For m = 0 we need no choice of Π0,v. Now, let T = {w0} consist of a single finite place [formula] at which πv is unramified and consider the representation [formula] of [formula] whose local components are the same as Π outside of S and are the irreducible induced representations on the right hand side of ([\ref=Piv]) when v∈S. We can now apply converse theorem again to [formula] and T = {w0} to conclude that [formula] is a transfer of π. The key here is that the induced representations on the right hand side of ([\ref=Piv]) have the right L-functions. Therefore, by uniqueness of the transfer we proved earlier we have [formula] for v∈S. This completes the proof.

Applications

We first recall that the current formulation of the Ramanujan conjecture for generic cuspidal representations states that for any quasi-split group [formula] and any globally generic unitary cuspidal automorphic representation [formula] the local components πv are tempered for all places v. As an application of our main theorem we can prove two types of results in this direction: estimates toward this conjecture for the group [formula] as well as a weaker version of it for generic representations of this group.

Estimates toward Ramanujan

Following [\cite=ckpss-classical] we introduce the following notation in order to prove estimates. Let [formula] be a unitary cuspidal automorphic representation of [formula]. For every place v the representation Πv is unitary generic and can be written as a full induced representation

[formula]

with [formula] and each Πi,v tempered [\cite=vogan] [\cite=Zel].

The classification of generic unitary dual of [formula] [\cite=tadic] [\cite=vogan] trivially gives [formula]. The best result currently known for a general number field k says that any unitary cuspidal representation of [formula] satisfies [formula] [\cite=luo-rudnick-sarnak]. When [formula] and m  ≤  4 it is [formula]. The same bound is also available for m  >  4 for [formula] provided that one knows that the symmetric square L-function of Π is absolutely convergent for [formula] (cf. [\cite=kim-sarnak]) but this is only available presently for m  ≤  4. When m = 2 we have the better bounds of H(1 / 9) for a general number field k [\cite=kim-shahidiDuke] and H(7 / 64) for [formula] [\cite=kim-sarnak].

The Ramanujan conjecture demands H(0).

Similarly, if [formula] is a unitary generic cuspidal automorphic representation of [formula], then by [\cite=muic] and [\cite=vogan] each πv can be written as a full induced representation

[formula]

where each πi,v is a tempered representation of some [formula] and τv is a tempered generic representation of some [formula] with [formula].

The classification of generic unitary dual of [formula] (cf. [\cite=lapid-tadic-muic], for example) trivially gives the estimate H(1). The Ramanujan conjecture demands H(0) again. For a survey of results in this direction and their applications we refer to [\cite=sarnak-fields-notes] [\cite=shahidi-borel].

Let k be a number field and assume that all unitary cuspidal representations of [formula] (respectively, [formula]) satisfy H(θ4) (respectively, H(θ2)) and θ2  ≤  θ4. Then, any globally generic unitary cuspidal representation π of [formula] satisfies H(θ4).

If π transfers to non-cuspidal representation of [formula] (cf. Theorem [\ref=main]), then it satisfies the possibly better bound H(θ2).

Let Π be the functorial transfer of π to [formula].

If v is an archimedean place of k, then this is clear since in this case local functoriality is well understood through Langlands parametrization (cf. proof of Theorem 6.1 of [\cite=gspin], for example, for more details).

Let v be a non-archimedean place of k at which πv is unramified. Then, it follows from ([\ref=chi]) that πv is given by its Frobenius-Hecke (Satake) parameter which is of the form

[formula]

where ϖ denotes a uniformizer of kv. If Π is cuspidal, then for i = 1,2 we have by assumption

[formula]

If Π is not cuspidal, then we have similar inequalities with θ4 replaced by even better estimate of θ2. Since πv is unitary, we have |χ0(ϖ)|  =  1. Therefore, Frobenius-Hecke parameters of πv also satisfy similar inequalities.

Next, assume that v is a place of k in S. Then, by Proposition [\ref=exp], a similar argument as above works again.

Let π be a globally generic unitary cuspidal representation of [formula]. Then π satisfies H(15 / 34). If π transfers to a non-cuspidal representation of [formula], then it satisfies H(1 / 9). If [formula], then we have the better estimates of H(9 / 22) and H(7 / 64), respectively.

The proof is immediate if we combine Theorem [\ref=est] with the known results on estimates for general linear groups mentioned above.

The Ramanujan conjecture for unitary cuspidal representations of [formula] and [formula] imply the Ramanujan conjecture for the generic spectrum of [formula].

Weak Ramanujan

Following [\cite=cog-ps-unitarity] [\cite=ramakrishnan-mrl] [\cite=kim-ex2] we recall the following definition.

We will be concerned with the cases of [formula] or [formula] in this paper. We recall that (unitary) cuspidal representations of [formula] for m  ≤  4 are weakly Ramanujan (cf. [\cite=ramakrishnan-mrl] and Propositions 3.7 and 6.3 of [\cite=kim-ex2]).

Let π be a globally generic unitary cuspidal representation of [formula]. For any [formula] as above, let

[formula]

be the Frobenius-Hecke parameter of πv (cf.([\ref=unram])). Then, as in ([\ref=Pi_vParameter]), the parameter of the local transfer Πv is given by

[formula]

Moreover, |a0,v|  =  1 since πv is unitary. Therefore, the above results about weak Ramanujan property of unitary cuspidal representations of [formula] immediately imply the following.

Let π be a globally generic unitary cuspidal representation of [formula]. Then π is weakly Ramanujan.

Spinor L-function for [formula]

As another application we get the following immediate corollary of our main result, Theorem [\ref=main].

Let π be a globally generic unitary cuspidal representation of [formula]. Then the spinor L-function L(s,π,spin) is entire.

Let Π be the transfer of π to [formula]. If Π is unitary cuspidal, then L(s,π,spin)  =  L(s,Π) and if [formula] is the isobaric sum of two unitary cuspidal representations of [formula], then we have L(s,π,spin)  =  L(s,Π1)L(s,Π2). In either case the L-functions on the right hand side are standard representations of the general linear group and are entire.

This result has also been proved by R. Takloo-Bighash in [\cite=ramin] among other things. His methods are different from ours and are based on integral representations.
