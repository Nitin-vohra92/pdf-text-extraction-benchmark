Ultrametric pseudodifferential operators and wavelets for the case of non homogeneous measure

Introduction

In the present paper we continue to develop the analysis of pseudodifferential operators on ultrametric spaces, following [\cite=IZV].

We consider for an ultrametric space X the directed tree T(X) of balls in X, and consider the partial order on [formula] defined by inclusion of balls and inclusion of points of X into balls. We consider on the space X a (σ-additive and possessing a countable or finite basis) measure ν of a general form and investigate pseudodifferential operators of the form

[formula]

acting in the space L2(X,ν) of quadratically integrable complex valued functions. The integration kernel T(I) is a function on the tree T(X) and I =  sup(x,y) is defined by the partial order on [formula].

We introduce the orthonormal basis of ultrametric wavelets in the space L2(X,ν), which diagonalizes the pseudodifferential operator T, and compute the corresponding eigenvalues.

Also we discuss the duality between ultrametric spaces and directed trees. In particular, we propose a new construction of ultrametric space as a completion of a directed tree T (i.e. of a tree with a direction, or defined in the special way partial order) with respect the the metric, defined by the direction.

The present paper develops the approach of the paper [\cite=IZV], where the particular case of the analysis ultrametric pseudodifferential operators of the type ([\ref=opT]) was considered, for which the measure ν was chosen in the special way, for which the maximal subballs in an ultrametric ball have the equal measure. In the present paper we consider more general case, for which the measures of the balls can be arbitrary positive numbers. We call this case the case of non homogeneous measure. Moreover, in [\cite=IZV] the more standard construction of ultrametric space as the set of classes of equivalence of decreasing infinitely continued paths in the directed tree was applied.

Investigation of ultrametric pseudodifferential operators was started [\cite=Vl1] with the introduction of the Vladimirov operator of p-adic fractional derivation, see [\cite=VVZ] for detailed exposition. Different problems of p-adic analysis and p-adic mathematical physics were considered in [\cite=Andr3]-[\cite=Kochubei2].

The Vladimirov operator can be diagonalized by the p-adic Fourier transform. Also there exist bases of eigenvectors with compact support [\cite=VVZ]. In paper [\cite=wavelets] the basis of p-adic wavelets in the space L2(Qp) of quadratically integrable complex valued functions on the field of p-adic numbers was introduced and it was shown that this basis is a basis of eigenvectors of the Vladimirov operator. In papers [\cite=Benedetto], [\cite=Benedetto1] the construction of the wavelet basis of [\cite=wavelets] was generalized onto more general local fields and groups.

In paper [\cite=nhoper] the family of pseudodifferential operators in the space L2(Qp), diagonal in the basis of p-adic wavelets, but not diagonalizable by the Fourier transform, was constructed, and the corresponding eigenvalues were computed. Further generalization of this result onto the case of pseudodifferential operators in L2(Qp) of more general form was performed in [\cite=trudy], [\cite=0403440]. In paper [\cite=IZV] theory of ultrametric wavelets and PDO related to general ultrametric spaces was developed (in less general case, compared to the present paper).

Theory of ultrametric pseudodifferential operators has physical applications. In papers [\cite=ABK], [\cite=PaSu] it was shown that the Parisi matrix, which describes replica symmetry breaking is a discrete analogue of some p-adic pseudodifferential operator. In papers [\cite=ABKO], [\cite=Trudy2] relation between ultrametric diffusion and dynamics of macromolecules was discussed. For the review of the results of p-adic mathematical physics see [\cite=VVZ]. In particular, one can mention applications to string theory [\cite=Vstring], [\cite=Freund], and mathematical models of biology and cognitive science [\cite=Andr1], [\cite=Andr2].

The present paper has the following structure.

In Section 2 build the structure of a directed tree on the set T(X) of balls in an ultrametric space X.

In Section 3 we introduce the family of directed trees and define ultrametric on the trees from this family.

In Section 4 we perform completion of the trees with respect to the introduced ultrametric and discuss the properties of the corresponding ultrametric spaces.

In Section 5 we construct orthonormal bases of ultrametric wavelets in the spaces of quadratically integrable functions on the ultrametric spaces under consideration.

In Section 6 we introduce pseudodifferential operators acting on complex valued functions on ultrametric spaces, show that these operators are diagonal in the bases of ultrametric wavelets, and compute the corresponding eigenvalues.

Directed tree T(X) of balls in ultrametric space

In the present Section we discuss relation between ultrametric space X and directed tree T(X) of balls in X. Let us give the necessary definitions.

Consider a complete ultrametric space X, satisfying the following properties:

1) The set of all balls of nonzero diameter in X is no more than countable;

2) For any decreasing sequence of balls {D(k)}, D(k)  ⊃  D(k + 1), diameters of the balls tend to zero;

3) Any ball is a finite union of maximal subballs.

Property 2 imply the following condition:

For any two balls I, J in X (of non zero diameter) and any sequence of balls {D(k)}, for which I  ⊂  D(k)  ⊂  J for all k, the sequence {D(k)} must be finite.

Complete ultrametric space, satisfying the properties 1, 2, 3 above, is locally compact.

Here the topology is generated by the ultrametric.

Proof  To prove that X is locally compact (i.e. any ball in X is compact) consider a sequence {xk} in ball D in X. Then, if the ball D is not minimal, it contains a subball D', which contains infinite subsequence of {xk}. Repeating this procedure, we obtain decreasing sequence of balls with the diameter tending to zero, where each of the balls contains infinite subsequence of {xk}. Therefore {xk} has a limiting point in D. Since the topology on X has a countable base, this implies the local compactness.

The next proposition gives the example of σ-additive measure on X.

Consider on the complete ultrametric space X, satisfying properties 1, 2, 3 the measure μ, satisfying for each ball DI the following property:

Measures of all the balls DIj, which are maximal subballs in DI, are equal.

Then the measure μ is σ-additive and has a countable or finite basis of balls.

Proof  It is easy to see that the considered above condition defines the measure μ up to multiplication by a constant.

Then σ-additivity follows from local compactness of X (in the same way as for the Lebesgue measure) [\cite=KF]. The countable or finite basis for μ is given by no more than countable set of balls in X. This finishes the proof of the proposition.

The next definition is the standard definition of a partially ordered set.

If any two elements of the partially ordered set are comparable, then this set is called completely ordered.

A supremum  sup  S of the subset S in the partially ordered set is a minimal element of the partially ordered set, which is greater or equal to all the elements of the subset S. If any finite subset of the partially ordered set has the unique supremum, then this partially ordered set is called directed (and the partial order is called a direction).

An infinite path in a graph is an injection of the set of natural numbers into the graph, such that numbers with the difference one correspond to the neighbor (connected by a link) vertices of the graph. A path of the length N in a graph is an injection of the set [formula] into the graph, such that the numbers with the difference one correspond to the neighbor (connected by a link) vertices of the graph. In the following we will not specialize, finite or infinite path we consider if this is clear from the context. By the applied definition all the considered paths have an orientation.

The image of 1, defined by the path in the graph, we will call the beginning of the path. For the finite path of length N the vertex, which is the image of N, will be called the end of the path. A graph is called connected if for arbitrary two vertices I, J there exists a finite path with the beginning in I and the end in J. A cycle in the graph is a pair of different finite paths, for which the beginnings and the ends coincide.

A tree is a connected graph without cycles. Consider an arbitrary tree T (finite or infinite), such that the number of links incident to any of the vertices is finite.

Assume that the tree T is partially ordered. If non maximal vertex I is incident to pI + 1 links, we will say that branching index of the vertex I is equal to pI. If maximal vertex I is incident to pI links, we will say that branching index of the vertex I is equal to pI. Equivalently, branching index of a vertex I in partially ordered tree is the number of vertices Ij: Ij < I, |IIj| = 1, where the distance between vertices of the tree is the number of edges in the path connecting these vertices.

For partially ordered trees T consider the following property:

Property 1

In particular, all neighbor (connected by a link) vertices are comparable.

For ultrametric space X consider the set T(X), which contains all the of balls in X of nonzero diameter, and the balls of zero diameter which are maximal subbals in balls of nonzero diameter. On the set T(X) there is the natural partial order: I < J if for the corresponding balls I  ⊂  J. Since for any two balls in an ultrametric space there exists the unique minimal ball, containing these two balls (which the supremum of the balls), the mentioned partial order will be a direction.

The set T(X) has the following structure of graph: vertices of the graph T(X) are balls in X, two vertices I and J are connected by a link if one is a subball in the other, say I  ⊃  J, and between I and J there are no other elements of T(X) (i.e. J is a maximal subball in I).

Prove that the graph T(X) will be a tree with finite branching indices. The properties (1), (3) of the ultrametric space X imply that T(X) has no more than countable number of vertices, and all branching indices are finite.

Since T(X) is directed and by the property (2) the graph T(X) is connected.

Assume we have a cycle in the graph T(X). Take a minimal element I of the cycle, and consider the balls J, K in X lying at the cycle and I  ⊂  J, I  ⊂  K. By ultrametricity of the space X, for any three balls I, J, K in X, such that I  ⊂  J, I  ⊂  K, the balls J and K will be comparable: either J  ⊂  K or K  ⊂  J. Therefore the cycle does not exist and the graph T(X) is a tree.

Then, it is easy to see that the branching index of the tree T(X) can not be equal to 1 for any vertex, and for the maximal vertex (if it exists) the branching index can not be equal to zero (if X contains at least two points). Moreover, balls of nonzero diameter in X correspond to vertices of branching index ≥  2 in T(X), and the balls of zero diameter which are maximal subbals in balls of nonzero diameter correspond to vertices of branching index 0 in T(X).

Let us prove that the direction in T(X) satisfies the Property 1. Consider I, J in T(X) and K =  sup(I,J). Consider the paths IJ, IK, JK and the vertex

[formula]

Then L  ≥  I, L  ≥  J and L  ≤  K which implies L = K, i.e. the supremum K lies at the path IJ. Moreover, it is easy to see that the paths IK and JK are completely ordered, which implies the Property 1.

We proved the following theorem.

The set T(X) which contains all the of balls of nonzero diameter, and the balls of zero diameter which are maximal subbals in balls of nonzero diameter in a non-trivial (containing at least two points) ultrametric space X, satisfying properties (1), (2), (3) above with the partial order, defined by inclusion of balls, is a directed tree where all neighbor vertices are comparable.

Branching index for vertices of this tree may take finite integer non-negative values not equal to one, and the maximal vertex (if exists) has the branching index ≥  2. Balls of nonzero diameter in X correspond to vertices of branching index ≥  2 in T(X), and the balls of zero diameter which are maximal subbals in balls of nonzero diameter correspond to vertices of branching index 0 in T(X).

Moreover, the direction in T(X) satisfies the Property 1.

Consider the set [formula], where we identify the balls of zero diameter from T(X) with the corresponding points in X. We call T(X) the tree of balls in X, and [formula] the extended tree of balls. One can say that [formula] is the set of all the balls in X, of nonzero and zero diameter.

Introduce the structure of a directed set on [formula]. At the tree T(X) this structure is already defined, and the relations of order with points of X are introduced as follows.

This implies the following lemma.

This construction extends the notion of supremum of two vertices of the tree T(X) (since the ball I =  sup(J,K) corresponds to the minimal ball I, which contains the balls J and K).

Introduce the structure of an ultrametric space on the extended tree [formula].

In particular, the tree T(X) will be (in general, incomplete) ultrametric space.

Moreover, a measure ν on ultrametric space X induces the measure (which we also denote by ν) on the extended tree [formula]: the measure of I∈T(X) we put equal to the measure of the corresponding ball in X.

Ultrametric on directed trees

In the present Section we discuss ultrametric on directed trees. The next theorem describe a family of equivalent ultrametrics on a directed tree (we call two metrics on the same space equivalent, if the both define the same set of balls).

Proof  To prove that |AB| is an ultrametric, it is sufficient to prove that |AB| satisfies the strong triangle inequality (the other conditions, necessary for ultrametricity, are obvious).

Consider vertices A, B, C. Let I =  sup(A,B), J =  sup(B,C), K =  sup(A,C).

Since the both vertices I and K are larger than A, these vertices are comparable (otherwise we would have in the tree T the cycle consisting of the two different paths AI sup(I,K), AK sup(I,K)). Analogously, vertices I and J are comparable; also vertices J and K are comparable. Therefore I, J, K is a completely ordered set.

Two variants are possible: either I = J = K, or there are some non coinciding vertices in this set. If I = J = K, then by ([\ref=eum])

[formula]

and the strong triangle inequality is satisfied.

Take I > J, i.e.  sup(A,B) >  sup(B,C). Then  sup(A,C) =  sup(A,B), i.e. I = K. Thus by ([\ref=eum])

[formula]

and the strong triangle inequality is satisfied.

Analogously, with other choices of order on the set I, J, K we obtain the strong triangle inequality.

Since the structure of the set of balls, defined in this way, depends only on the direction on the tree and does not depend on the function F, ultrametrics, defined by different F, are equivalent.

This finishes the proof of the theorem.

Proof  Let us prove that, if Property 1 is satisfied, then for an arbitrary finite set of vertices there exists the unique supremum (i.e. the partial order is a direction). It is sufficient to prove this statement for the case of a pair of vertices, since if for any two vertices A, B there exists the unique supremum  sup(A,B), and we choose an arbitrary vertex C, then

[formula]

Therefore the existence of the unique supremum for any pair of vertices implies the existence and uniqueness of  sup(A,B,C). Analogously one can argue for the case of arbitrary finite number of vertices.

Property 1 implies that for the maximal vertex C at the path AB the paths AC and CB are completely ordered sets.

For vertices A, B we consider the path AB which connects these vertices and prove, that the unique maximal vertex C at this path is the supremum for A, B, and, moreover, this supremum is uniquely defined.

Let D be some vertex, greater than A, B. Consider the path which connects A and D. By Property 1 this path contains the maximal vertex, which greater than A and D. Since D > A, this maximal vertex coincides with D. Analogously, vertex D is the maximal vertex at the path which connects B and D. Moreover, the paths AD and BD are completely ordered.

Consider now the paths AB, AD, BD. Since we consider a tree, there exists the unique vertex E, which belongs to all the three paths. Vertex E satisfies the inequalities

[formula]

Therefore E = C. This shows that C is the unique supremum for A and B, and the partial order is a direction.

This finishes the proof of the lemma.

The next lemma shows that there exists one-to-one correspondence between directions in the tree T, satisfying the Property 1, and equivalence classes of paths in T. This gives the constructive way to describe directions on trees, satisfying the Property 1.

Proof  Let vertices A, B be connected by a link. Then, since the tree T does not contain cycles, either B∈Ax, or A∈Bx, and vertices A, B are comparable.

Now let A, B be arbitrary vertices. Consider the paths Ax, Bx. These paths and the path AB intersect in the unique vertex C. By construction C > A, C > B, and C is the unique maximal vertex at the path AB. Therefore the introduced partial order satisfies the Property 1 and by lemma [\ref=p1dir] is a direction.

Conversely, consider a direction on the tree T, which satisfies the Property 1. Take vertex A and consider the neighbor vertices (connected to A by links). By the Property 1 this set of vertices (which contain A and the neighbor vertices) contains the unique maximal vertex A1. Again, consider the set of vertices, which are the neighbors of A1 (and A1 itself), and take the maximal vertex A2. Repeating this procedure, we get the increasing path [formula] (which may be finite or infinite).

Starting from some vertex B, in the analogous way we obtain the increasing path [formula]. Since by the Property 1 the path AB contains the unique maximal vertex C =  sup(A,B), then

[formula]

and the paths [formula], [formula] coincide starting from vertex C. Thus these two paths are in the same equivalence class.

This finishes the proof of the lemma.

Introduce now the ultrametric on the directed tree T (where the direction satisfies the Property 1), which we call the standard. This example of ultrametric was discussed in [\cite=IZV].

Let us put into correspondence to a link of the tree T the branching index of the largest vertex of the link (this definition is correct since any two vertices, connected by a link, are comparable). Link is increasing, if the end of the link is larger than the beginning, and is decreasing in the opposite case.

By theorem [\ref=isultrametric] the introduced distance is an ultrametric.

Absolute and completed tree

In the present Section we consider completions of directed trees with respect to ultrametric, defined by theorem [\ref=isultrametric] of the previous Section. This gives a constructive way to build ultrametric spaces. This construction is similar to the construction of real (and p-adic) numbers by completion of rational numbers.

Sets [formula] and X(T) are complete ultrametric spaces.

Here we understand subtraction of the tree from its completion as follows: vertex A is identified with the equivalence class of sequences of vertices, coinciding with A, starting from some element.

Definition [\ref=DefX] is equivalent to the standard definition of the absolute of the tree, see [\cite=Serre] (more definitely, to the absolute without one point, corresponding to the equivalence class od increasing paths). Let us call a path in the tree infinitely continued, if the path is either infinite or finish at vertex with branching index 0.

Proof  We put into correspondence to a decreasing path in the tree T the sequence of vertices as follows: if the path is infinite, the sequence is the sequence of vertices at the path; if the path is finite, the sequence is the sequence of vertices at the path, extended by the infinite sequence where the term is the last vertex of the path.

Applying this construction to a class of equivalence of decreasing paths, we get a set of fundamental sequences from the same equivalence class with respect to the ultrametric ([\ref=eum]). Thus the set of equivalence classes of decreasing paths is a subset in [formula].

Formula ([\ref=eum]) implies that any fundamental sequence in T with metric ([\ref=eum]) contains a subsequence which coincide, starting from some term, with a subsequence of the sequence, defined by some decreasing path. Therefore, the set [formula] is equivalent to the set of all equivalence classes of decreasing paths.

Analogously, an equivalence class of infinitely continued decreasing paths corresponds to some point of the absolute X(T), and any equivalence class of sequences of vertices of the tree, corresponding to some point of the absolute, contains an equivalence class of infinitely continued decreasing paths. This finishes the proof of the lemma.

The introduced completed tree [formula] coincides with [formula], where X = X(T). This shows the duality between complete ultrametric spaces, satisfying conditions (1), (2), (3) of Section 2, and directed trees with finite branching index ≠  1, the direction satisfying the Property 1, and where the maximal vertex (if exists) has branching index ≥  2.

Ultrametric wavelets

In the present and next Sections we consider complete ultrametric space X, satisfying the properties 1, 2, 3. Consider a σ-additive possessing a countable or finite basis of balls positive measure ν on ultrametric space X.

Build a basis in the space L2(X,ν) of quadratically integrable with respect to the measure ν functions, which we will call the basis of ultrametric wavelets.

Denote VI the space of functions on X, generated by characteristic functions of the maximal subballs in the ball of nonzero radius DI. Correspondingly, we denote V0I the subspace of codimension 1 in VI of functions with zero mean with respect to the measure ν. The proof of the following lemma is straightforward.

We introduce in the space V0I some orthonormal basis {ψIj}, where the number of vectors in the basis is obviously less or equal to pI - 1. The next theorem shows how to construct the orthonormal basis in L2(X,ν), taking the union of bases {ψIj} in spaces V0I over all non minimal I.

1) Let the ultrametric space X contains an increasing sequence of embedded balls with infinitely increasing measure. Then the set of functions {ψIj}, where I runs over all non minimal vertices of the tree T(X) is an orthonormal basis in L2(X,ν).

2) Let for the ultrametric space X there exists the supremum of measures of the balls, which is equal to A. Then the set of functions [formula], where I runs over all non minimal vertices of the tree T(X) is an orthonormal basis in L2(X,ν).

The introduced in the present theorem basis we call the basis of ultrametric wavelets. For the case when the measure ν is defined in the special way: the measure of a ball is equal to its diameter, this theorem (and the results of the next Section on diagonalization of ultrametric PDO) was obtained in [\cite=IZV].

Proof  By lemma [\ref=orthogonality] the described in the statement of the theorem functions are orthonormal.

To prove the totality we use the Parseval identity. Since the set of characteristic functions of all the balls DI is total in L2(X,ν), to prove the totality it is sufficient to prove the Parseval identity only for characteristic functions χI(x).

Consider the characteristic function χI of the ball DI, satisfying the condition ν(DI) > 0 (and therefore χI  ≠  0 in L2(X,ν)). Expand the characteristic function χI(x) over the wavelets. It is sufficient to consider wavelets ψJj with J > I.

Denote PV the orthogonal projection onto V in L2(X,ν). Then

[formula]

Consider the vector

[formula]

where (J - 1,I) is the (uniquely defined) maximal vertex, which is less than J and larger than I. The above vector is expanded into the series over the orthogonal vectors. Compute the square of the length [formula]:

[formula]

Since for J  ≥  I

[formula]

(this expression is correct since ν(DJ) > 0 for J  ≥  I), we get

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

This implies

[formula]

where the limit at the RHS is the limit of the expression in square brackets for the sequence of increasing J, which begins from I.

In the case 1 formula ([\ref=pars1]) implies the Parseval identity for χI.

In the case 2 we get for ([\ref=pars1])

[formula]

Since in this case to prove the totality we have to add to the expression above the term corresponding to the contribution of the normed constant:

[formula]

we again obtain the Parseval identity, which finishes the proof of the theorem.

Diagonalization of ultrametric PDO

In the present Section we study the ultrametric pseudodifferential operator (or the PDO) of the form

[formula]

Here T(I) is some complex valued function on the tree T(X). Thus the structure of this operator is determined by the direction on [formula].

Proof  Consider the action of the operator onto the wavelet ψIj:

[formula]

Consider the following cases.

1) Let x does not lie at the ball DI. Then

[formula]

2) Let x∈DI. Denote μ(DI) the diameter of the ball DI. Then

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

To prove the last identity let us compute for ψ∈V0I the integral

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Here DIj are the maximal subballs in DI.

We get

[formula]

where

[formula]

For J > I

[formula]

Since any two increasing paths in a directed tree coincide starting from some vertex, condition ([\ref=seriesconverge]) provides convergence of the integral [formula].

This implies

[formula]

Proof that the operator T kills constants is straightforward. This finishes the proof of the theorem.
