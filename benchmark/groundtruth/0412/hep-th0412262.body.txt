Probability distributions in statistical ensembles with conserved charges

Introduction

Macroscopic data of an equilibrium state are described by means of statistical distributions of microscopic variables specific for a given ensemble. In the application to the description of particle production in high energy particle collisions we are generally dealing with the grand canonical ensemble with respect to the particle number [\cite=pb] [\cite=rh] [\cite=rafelski]. In the ultrarelativistic situation energy conservation and particle number are usually controlled by the temperature of the system [\cite=liu].

Applications of statistical physics concepts to multiparticle production processes require however the implementation of internal symmetries [\cite=redlich] [\cite=turko] that result in associated conservation of quantum numbers. In the grand canonical formulation (GC) conservation of quantum numbers is implemented on the average and is determined by the corresponding chemical potential. On the other hand in the canonical ensemble (C) quantum number conservation is treated exactly.

In general the thermodynamic quantities calculated in the GC and C ensembles differ. This is particularly the case when dealing with small systems [\cite=pb] [\cite=rh] [\cite=rafelski] [\cite=liu] [\cite=can] [\cite=can1]. Since relativistic heavy ion collisions correspond to a finite volume and to a given charge value, the canonical ensemble should be used whenever the GC and C formalisms give different answers [\cite=rh] [\cite=can1] [\cite=ho] [\cite=anti] [\cite=str]. It is however to be expected that in the thermodynamic limit the C and GC descriptions should provide the same answer for physical observables [\cite=rh] [\cite=ho] [\cite=anti]. The thermodynamic limit is reached in the large volume for fixed density limit in C and for fixed average density in the GC ensemble. Only in this limit can one indiscriminately use the GC or C descriptions. The results presented here do not rely on the system under consideration being of a relativistic nature and apply equally well to relativistic and non-relativistic systems.

There is an essential difference in the volume dependence of observables in the GC and C formulations [\cite=pb] [\cite=rh] [\cite=rafelski] [\cite=can] [\cite=ho]. Consequently in the limit when V  →    ∞   some ratios of extensive quantities could in general converge to different values in GC and C ensemble [\cite=begun]. It is thus clear that the equivalence of both descriptions in the thermodynamic limit can be strictly established only for intensive observables [\cite=rh].

In applications of statistical models to particle production in high energy collisions of elementary particles [\cite=pp] and in heavy ion collisions [\cite=pb] [\cite=aa] we are always dealing with small systems. Thus, the model description of particle yields is in principle canonical with respect to the conservation laws. This is particularly evident in elementary particle and peripheral heavy ion collisions where e.g. strangeness production is strongly suppressed due to canonical effects [\cite=str]. However, a detailed analysis of different particle yields [\cite=pb] [\cite=ho] [\cite=anti] [\cite=aa] [\cite=str] has shown that in central heavy ion collisions the relative error between the C and GC descriptions is so small that the GC approximation can be used with confidence.

Recently, an interesting observation has been made [\cite=begun] that in finite systems even very small relative errors between C and GC results seen on the level of first particle moments i.e. thermal particle multiplicities do not necessarily guarantee that this is also the case for higher moments or particle fluctuations. Contrary, for a set of thermal parameters relevant in high energy heavy ion collisions the second moment differs substantially in the GC and C ensembles at finite V even though the first moments agree to high accuracy. The above observation has been generalized [\cite=begun] to the large volume limit with the conclusion of the violation of GC and C ensemble equivalence in the thermodynamic limit on the level of particle number fluctuations.

However, a direct comparison of GC and C results for the average charged particle number or higher moments is only adequate for a finite system. In the thermodynamic limit such a comparison can be only done at the level of densities. This is simply because in the large volume limit only particle densities are finite in GC and C ensemble whereas corresponding multiplicities are infinite in both cases. In the thermodynamic limit the equivalence problem of GC and C formulation of the conservation laws requires intensive observables.

We show that different statistical ensembles with respect to conservation laws are exactly equivalent in the thermodynamic limit. Consequently, there is equivalence of all possible moments, relative fluctuations, scaled variance etc. The exact calculations are performed in the GC and C ensemble with arbitrary values of the conserved charge.

Probability distributions in canonical and grand canonical ensembles

The equivalence of canonical and grand canonical ensembles of statistical systems with conservation laws will be discussed for a non-interacting relativistic gas of charged particles and antiparticles in a volume V at temperature T. Particles and antiparticles have charge ±  1 respectively.

Let us consider a system with total overall charge Q with N = N- antiparticles and N+ = N + Q particles. The requirement of the exact charge conservation in the canonical ensemble leads to the following partition function [\cite=pb] [\cite=rh] [\cite=rafelski]

[formula]

where z is the one-particle partition function

[formula]

IQ and K2 are the modified Bessel functions [\cite=Abram:2004zb].

To obtain the average particle multiplicity moments one introduces in e.g.([\ref=eq1]) fugacity parameters λ+ and λ-, which are set to one in the final formulae

[formula]

such that

[formula]

From Eqs. ([\ref=eq3]-[\ref=eq4]) it is clear that

[formula]

is the probability distribution to find N negatively and N + Q positively charged particles in a system of volume V, temperature T and total charge Q [\cite=pk] [\cite=lin].

In the grand canonical ensemble the charge is conserved on the average, thus the partition function

[formula]

where γ is chosen such as to reproduce the average charge 〈Q〉 in the system. For a non-interacting gas the trace in the above equation can be calculated explicitly yielding

[formula]

where as in Eq. ([\ref=eq3]) we have introduced auxiliary fugacities λ± for particles and antiparticles. Following Eq. ([\ref=eq4]) the average number of particles and the average charge in the GC ensemble is obtained as

[formula]

In terms of the total charge Q = N+ - N- the GC partition function ([\ref=eq8]) can be written as

[formula]

with N = N- being the number of negatively charged particles. Thus, the function

[formula]

defines the probability distribution in a GC ensemble, with average charge 〈Q〉, to find a charge Q with N negatively charged particles. Expressing the chemical potential appearing in ([\ref=eq12]) through the corresponding average charge from ([\ref=eq9]) one finds

[formula]

All other less restricted probabilities can now be obtained directly from Eq. ([\ref=eq13]). The probability distribution PGC〈Q〉 ~ (N,V) to find N particles or PGC〈Q〉(Q,V) to find charge Q in the volume V at a given average charge 〈Q〉 are obtained from The summations in Eqs. ([\ref=eq14a]) and ([\ref=eq14b]) can be done explicitly yielding The particle number probability distribution ([\ref=eq15a]) is, as expected [\cite=pk] [\cite=lin], a Poisson distribution. The charge distribution, on the other hand, is not Poissonian due to the constraints imposed by the requirement of the exact charge conservation in a given sector of GC ensemble with a fixed average charge 〈Q〉.

Probability distributions in the thermodynamic limit

In the previous section we have introduced a set of probability distributions in the GC and C ensembles related to the charged particle number. All these distributions are also valid for any value of the conserved charge as well as the volume of the system. Thus, they can be used to analyze the thermodynamic limit.

From ([\ref=eq5]) and ([\ref=eq13]) one finds

[formula]

It is straightforward that in the sector of fixed charge Q the corresponding particle number is distributed as in the canonical ensemble. That is why in Eq. ([\ref=eq16]) the GC probability function PGC〈Q〉 is just the product of the canonical particle number and the grand canonical charge distribution.

To take the thermodynamic limit in ([\ref=eq16]) one first expresses the variables (N,Q,〈Q〉) by means of the corresponding densities (n,q,〈q〉) and then one takes the limit V  →    ∞   for fixed densities. This also requires the replacement of a discrete sum [formula].

The essential difference between GC and C distributions in Eq. ([\ref=eq16]) appears through the probability function PGC〈Q〉(Q,V). Thus, to study the equivalence of GC and C ensemble on the probability level in the thermodynamic limit, it is sufficient to find PGC∞〈q〉(q) from

[formula]

where PGC〈q〉 is obtained from Eq. ([\ref=eq15b]) by replacing 〈Q〉 and Q by V〈q〉 and Vq respectively. The large volume limit in ([\ref=eq17]) is taken at fixed densities. An extra volume factor in Eq. ([\ref=eq17]) appears from the replacement of discrete by continuum variables.

The limit in Eq. ([\ref=eq17]) is obtained from the α  →    ∞   behavior of the Bessel function [\cite=Abram:2004zb]

[formula]

Consequently, the charge density probability distribution

[formula]

It is rather straightforward to see from Eq. ([\ref=eq19]) that the limit V  →    ∞   does not exist as a regular function. This limit is zero for any q  ≠  〈q〉 and infinity for q  =  〈q〉. Let us consider however the thermodynamic limit in Eqs. ([\ref=eq17]) and ([\ref=eq19]) as a generalized function

[formula]

The density integration in ([\ref=eq20]) is obtained through the saddle-point method

[formula]

where the function

[formula]

In the large volume limit the dominant contribution to the integral ([\ref=eq21]) is obtained as

[formula]

where q0  =  〈q〉 is just a saddle-point such that S'(q0) = 0. From Eq. ([\ref=eq23]) one finds

[formula]

which means that the charge density probability distribution ([\ref=eq17]) converges to a delta function

[formula]

The above result together with Eq. ([\ref=eq16]) taken in the thermodynamic limit completes the proof of equivalence of the GC and C ensembles on the probability level. The probability to find a given density of particles and antiparticles in the GC ensemble with a fixed average charge density 〈q〉 is exactly equal to the corresponding probability in the C ensemble if one identifies charge density q in the C ensemble with 〈q〉. The same replacement q  →  〈q〉 is required for all intensive thermodynamic observables.

Summary

The equivalence of the grand canonical and canonical descriptions of the conservation laws has been considered in the thermodynamic limit. The problem has been studied in the relativistic gas composed only from one type of non-interacting particles and antiparticles with the constraints imposed by charge conservation. Detailed studies of the equivalence problem of canonical and grand canonical ensemble were presented on the level of probability distributions. In the thermodynamic limit the probability distributions for particle and antiparticle densities coincide in canonical and grand canonical ensembles. Consequently, for charged particle densities there is full equivalence of all possible scaled moments, relative fluctuations and scaled variance in the thermodynamic limit.
