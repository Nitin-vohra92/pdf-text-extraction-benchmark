Equivariant volumes for linearized actions

Introduction

Let M be an n-dimensional complex projective manifold, [formula] a g-dimensional reductive connected complex Lie group, and ν:  ×  M  →  M a holomorphic action. A [formula]-line bundle (L,) on M will mean the assignment of a holomorphic line bundle L on M together with a lifting (a linearization) :  ×  L  →  L of the action of [formula] (to simplify notation, we shall generally leave [formula] understood, and denote a [formula]-line bundle by [formula]).

If L is a [formula]-line bundle, there is for every integer k  ≥  0 an induced representation of [formula] on the complex vector space of holomorphic sections [formula]. This implies a [formula]-equivariant direct sum decomposition

[formula]

where Λ+ is the set of dominant weights for a given choice of a maximal torus T̃  ⊆   and of a fundamental Weyl chamber. For every dominant weight μ, let us denote the associated irreducible finite dimensional representation of [formula] by Vμ. For every μ∈Λ+, the summand [formula] is [formula]-equivariantly isomorphic to a direct sum of copies of Vμ.

Suppose that the line bundle L is ample. We shall address in this paper the asymptotic growth of the dimensions

[formula]

of the equivariant spaces of sections [formula], for μ fixed and k  →    +    ∞  . This problem has been the object of much attention over the years, and has been approached both algebraically [\cite=b], [\cite=bd] and symplectically - in the latter sense it is part of the broad and general picture revolving around the quantization commutes with reduction principle [\cite=gs-gq], [\cite=ggk], [\cite=ms], [\cite=s].

In this paper, we shall study this problem under the general assumption that the stable locus of L is non-empty, [formula]. Thus the most general result in our setting is now the Riemann-Roch type formula for multiplicities proved in [\cite=ms]. This is a deep and fundamental Theorem - with a rather complex symplectic proof. However, we adopt a different, more algebro-geometric approach, taking as point of departure the Guillemin-Sternberg conjecture for regular actions (in the sense of § 2 below). Our motivation was partly to understand the leading asymptotics for singular actions by fairly elementary algebro-geometric arguments. Besides the hypothesis that [formula], our arguments need an additional technical assumption, namely that the pair (M,L) admits a Kirwan resolution with certain mildness properties. Roughly, every divisorial component of the unstable locus upstairs should map to the unstable locus downstairs (Definition [\ref=defn:mild]); such resolutions will be called mild.

One can produce examples showing that [formula] may not be described, in general, by an asymptotic expansion, even if the GIT quotient M /    /   is nonsingular (but see § 2 below and the discussion in [\cite=pao-mm]). Inspired by the notion of volume of a big line bundle [\cite=del], we shall then introduce and study the μ-equivariant volume of a [formula]-line bundle L, defined as

[formula]

Because it leads to a concise and simple statement, we shall focus on the special case where the stabilizer K  ⊆   of a general p∈M is a (necessarily finite) central subgroup. Our methods can however be applied with no conceptual difficulty to the case of an arbitrary principal type (the conjugacy class of the generic stabilizer). This will involve singling out for each μ the kernel Kμ  ⊆  K of the action of K on the coadjoint orbit of μ, and considering the contribution coming from each conjugacy class of Kμ.

Let us then assume that K is a central subgroup. By restricting the linearization to K, we obtain an induced character [formula].

Another character [formula] is associated to the choice of a dominant weight [formula]. Namely, K lies in the chosen maximal torus, and K is the restriction to K of the character [formula] induced by μ by exponentiation, [formula]. We may define [formula] (the restriction of [formula] to K). An alternative description of K is as follows: Let G  ⊆   be a maximal compact subgroup, T  ⊆  G a maximal torus, and suppose [formula], where [formula] is the Lie algebra of T. If [formula] is the Lie algebra of G, let [formula] be the coadjoint orbit of μ. Since μ is an integral weight, the natural Kähler structure on Oμ is in fact a Hodge form, that is, it represents an integral cohomology class. The associated ample holomorphic line bundle Aμ  →  Oμ is a G-line bundle in a natural manner. Since the action of K is trivial on Oμ, the linearization induces the character K on K.

We then have:

Let M be a complex projective manifold, [formula] a reductive complex Lie group, ν:  ×  M  →  M a holomorphic action. Suppose for simplicity that the stabilizer of a general p∈M is a central subgroup K  ⊆  . Let L be an ample [formula]-line bundle on M such that [formula] and admitting a mild Kirwan resolution. Let M0 = :M /    /   be the GIT quotient with respect to the linearization L. Let μ∈Λ+ be a dominant weight. Let [formula] be the characters introduced above. Then:

Here [formula] is an orbifold, [formula] is a partial resolution of singularities, L induces on [formula] a natural nef and big line-orbibundle 0, with first Chern class [formula], and

The case [formula].

Let us begin by considering the case where the stable and semistable loci for the [formula]-line bundle are equal and nonempty: [formula]. First, as we shall make use of the Riemann-Roch formulae for multiplicities for regular actions conjectured by Guillemin and Sternberg, and first proved by Meinrenken [\cite=mein1], [\cite=mein2], it is in order to recall how these algebro-geometric hypothesis translate in symplectic terms. Let us choose a maximal compact subgroup G of [formula]. Thus G is a g-dimensional real Lie group, and [formula] is the complexification of G. Let [formula] denote the Lie algebra of G. We may without loss choose a G-invariant Hermitian metric hL on L, such that the unique covariant derivative on L compatible with hL and the holomorphic structure has curvature - 2πiΩ, where Ω is a G-invariant Hodge form on M. The given structure of G-line bundle of L, furthermore, determines (and, up to topological obstructions, is equivalent to) a moment map [formula] for the action of G on the symplectic manifold (M,Ω) [\cite=gs-gq]. The hypothesis that [formula] may be restated symplectically as follows: [formula] is a regular value of Φ, and [formula] [\cite=kir1]. In this case, P = :Φ- 1(0) is a connected G-invariant codimension g submanifold of M.

Let G and Φ be as above. The action of G on Φ- 1(0) is locally free, and the GIT quotient M /    /   = Ms(L) /  may be identified in a natural manner with the symplectic reduction M0 = :Φ- 1(0) / G, and is therefore a Kähler orbifold. The quantizing line bundle L descends to a line orbibundle L0 on M0.

Similar considerations apply to symplectic reductions at coadjoint orbits sufficiently close to the origin. If the [formula]-line bundle L is replaced by its tensor power [formula], the Hodge form and the moment map get replaced by their multiples kΩ and Φk = :kΦ. Given any [formula], there exists k0 such that μ is a regular value of Φk if k  ≥  k0. The relevant asymptotic information about the multiplicity of Vμ in [formula] may then determined by computing appropriate Riemann-Roch numbers on these orbifolds [\cite=kawa], [\cite=mein2].

Let [formula] be the coadjoint orbit through μ; since μ is integral, the Kirillov symplectic form σμ is a Hodge form on the complex projective manifold Oμ. By the Konstant version of the Borel-Bott theorem, there is an ample line bundle Aμ on Oμ such that H0(Oμ,Aμ) is the irreducible representation of G with highest weight μ.

Let then M(k)μ be the Weinstein symplectic reduction of M at μ with respect to the moment map Φk = kΦL (k  ≫  0). Using the normal form description of the symplectic and Hamiltonian structure of (M,Ω) in the neighbourhood of the coisotropic submanifold P = Φ- 1(0) [\cite=mein2], [\cite=gotay], [\cite=gs], one can verify that M(k)μ is, up to diffeomorphism, the quotient of P  ×  Oμ by the product action of G. In other words, M(k)μ is the fibre orbibundle on M0 = P / G associated to the principal G-orbibundle q:P  →  M0 and the G-space Oμ (endowed with the opposite Kähler structure); in particular its diffeotype is independent of k for k  ≫  0. Let pμ:M(k)μ  →  M0 be the projection.

Let θ be a connection 1-form for q ([\cite=ggk], Appendix B). By the shifting trick, the symplectic structure Ω(k)μ of the orbifold M(k)μ is obtained by descending the closed 2-form kι*(Ω) +  < μ,F(θ) >  - σμ on P  ×  Oμ down to the quotient (the symbols of projections are omitted for notational simplicity). The minimal coupling term <  μ,F(θ) >  - σμ is the curvature of the line orbibundle [formula] on M(k)μ. Thus, Ω(k)μ is the curvature form of the line orbibundle [formula].

Let

[formula]

There is a natural inclusion P̃μ,K  ⊆  Pμ. Now let Σμ = :P̃μ / G, Σμ,K = :P̃μ,K / G = M(k)μ  ×  K. There is a natural orbifold complex immersion Σμ  →  M(k)μ, with complex normal orbi-bundle NΣμ, and Σμ,K  ⊆  Σμ is the union of the |K| connected components mapping dominantly (and isomorphically) onto M(k)μ. The orbifold multiplicity of Σμ,K is constant and equal to |K|. Let L0 be the line orbi-bundle on M0 determined by descending L, and let 0 be its pull-back to Σ0. Let r be the complex dimension of Oμ, so that dim M(k)μ = n - g + r. After [\cite=mein1] and [\cite=mein2], the multiplicity N(k)(μ) of the irreducible representation Vμ in [formula] is then given by:

[formula]

Now suppose that [formula]. Then the action of K on [formula] is not trivial, where [formula] is the inclusion. Therefore, the fiber of [formula] on the smooth locus of M0 is a nontrivial quotient of [formula], and N(k)(μ) = 0 in this case. If there exists k such that [formula], on the other hand, the same condition holds with k replaced by [formula], where e is the period of χK,L and [formula] is arbitrary. Thus k may be assumed arbitrarily large. Passing to the original Kähler structure of Oμ in the computation, and recalling that [formula], we easily obtain:

[formula]

The asymptotics of equivariant volumes.

Let f:  →  M be a Kirwan desingularization of the action [\cite=kir2] . This means that f is a G-equivariant birational morphism, obtained as a sequence of blow-ups along G-invariant smooth centers, such that for all a  ≫  0 the ample G-line bundle [formula] satisfies [formula]. Here E  ⊆   is an effective exceptional divisor for f. Clearly υμ(F) = υμ(f*(F)) for every G-line bundle F on M.

Let [formula] be the divisorial part of the unstable locus of B; in other words, [formula] is the union of the irreducible components of Mu(B) having codimension one in [formula]. We shall say that the Kirwan resolution f is mild if [formula].

We have:

Let L be an ample G-line bundle on M such that [formula]. Suppose that f:  →  M is a mild Kirwan resolution of (M,L). Let H be a G-line bundle on [formula] such that χK,H = 1. Let μ∈Λ+ be a dominant weight. Then for any ε > 0 there exist arbitrarily large positive integers m (how large depending on ε and μ) such that

[formula]

More precisely, this will hold whenever m = 1 + p  e, where e is the period of χK,L and [formula], p  ≫  0.

As a corollary, we obtain the following equivariant version of Lemma 3.5 of [\cite=del] (for the case of finite group actions, see Lemma 3 of [\cite=pao-ages]).

Under the same hypothesis, let H be a G-line bundle on M. Then for any ε > 0 there exist arbitrarily large integers m > 0 (how large depending on ε and μ) such that [formula].

By definition, [formula] for every m > 0. Thus Corollary [\ref=cor:equivariant-del] with H = OM implies:

Let L be a G-line bundle with [formula]. Then

[formula]

Similarly,

Under the same hypothesis,

[formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:equivariant-del-new]. The proof is inspired by arguments in [\cite=del]. If υμ(L) = 0, there is nothing to prove; we shall assume from now on that υμ(L) > 0, and for simplicity write L for f*(L). Thus there exists 0  ≤  r < e such that χrK,L  ·  K = 1, where e is the period of χK,L. If [formula], by the above [formula], so that [formula]. Thus there is no loss of generality in replacing H by [formula] for some [formula]. In view of the hypothesis on H, we may thus assume without loss the existence of 0  ≠  σ∈H0(,H)G  ≠  {0}, with invariant divisor [formula].

Since furthermore the class of B in the G-ample cone introduced in [\cite=dh] lies in the interior of some chamber, the class of [formula] lies in the same chamber for [formula]. Hence we may as well assume that H is a very ample G-line bundle satisfying [formula].

By definition of υμ, there exists a sequence [formula] such that

[formula]

Necessarily [formula] (mod e), [formula]. We shall show that the stated inequality holds if p  ≫  0 and m = :1 + p  e.

Fix p  ≫  0 and let m = :1 + p  e. There is a sequence [formula] such that

[formula]

with [formula] (mod e) and furthermore [formula] (mod m) for every ν.

Proof. Let x > 0 be an integer. We may assume that there is a non-zero section [formula]. Thus, there are injections

[formula]

and for ν  ≫  0 we have

[formula]

Perhaps after passing to a subsequence, we may assume without loss of generality that [formula] (mod. m), for a fixed 0  ≤  r'  ≤  m - 1. Thus, [formula]. Let now x > 0 be an integer of the form x = sm + r' - e, [formula]. Then xpe = x(m - 1) and

[formula]

Now we need only set kν = :sν + xpe.

Set [formula]. Thus [formula].

There exists a > 0 such that [formula] for every m  ≥  1.

Proof. If r  ≫  0, the equivalence class of the G-line bundles [formula] in the G-ample cone lie in the interior of the same chamber as the class of H. Thus, they share the same stable and semistable loci, and determine the same GIT quotient 0. The G-line bundles [formula] and [formula] descend to genuine line bundles H'0 and L'0 on M0, and H' is ample. Thus, for some a  ≫  0 the ample line bundles [formula] and [formula] are globally generated. Arguing as in [\cite=gs-gq], [formula] lift to G-invariant sections of [formula].

If R and S are G-line bundles on [formula], any 0  ≠  σ∈H0(,R)G induces injections [formula]. Thus, if H0(,R)G  ≠  0 then [formula] for every μ. Now, in additive notation, [formula] for any G-line bundle R; therefore, by Lemma [\ref=lem:non-vanishing]

[formula]

We may now use the G-equivariant exact sequences of sheaves:

[formula]

for 0  ≤  j < s, to conclude inductively that

[formula]

We may decompose D as D = Du + Ds, where Du,Ds  ≥  0 are effective divisors on [formula], Du is supported on the unstable locus of B, u(B)  ⊆  M, and no irreducible component of Ds is supported on Mu(B). Let [formula] and [formula] be the decomposition in irreducilbe components.

If [formula] is general, then Ds is reduced, and it is nonsingular away from the unstable locus u(H) = Mu(B).

Proof. Perhaps after replacing H by some appropriate power we may assume that the linear series [formula] is base point free away from u(H). The claim then follows from Bertini's Theorem.

We now make use of the mildness assumption on f. If m  ≫  0 is fixed, ν  ≫  0 and [formula], then the moment map of the (not necessarily ample) line bundle [formula] is bounded away from 0 in the neighbourhood of Du. An adaptation of the arguments in § 5 of [\cite=gs-gq] (applied on some resolution of singularities of each Duj) then shows that [formula] (if Du is not reduced, we need only filter ODuj(kν  L - s  H) by an appropriate chain of line bundles).

Since furthermore on each Dsj we may find a non-vanishing invariant section of H, we obtain:

[formula]

There exists C > 0 constant such that if [formula] is general then

[formula]

for every k  ≫  0.

Proof. Given the equivariant injective morphism of structure sheaves [formula] we may as well assume that Ds is a reduced and irreducible G-invariant divisor, descending to a Cartier divisor D0 on the quotient.

Let [formula], with associated moment map ΦR. By the generality in its choice, we may assume that [formula] is non-singular in the neighbourhood of Φ- 1R(0), and is transversal to it. In fact, the singular locus of [formula] is the unstable locus of H. Furthermore, by the arguments of Lemma 3 in [\cite=pao-mm] and compactness one can see the following: There exist a finite number of holomorphic embeddings φi:B  →  , where [formula] is the unit ball, satisfying i): φi(B)  ⊆  Φ- 1R(0); ii): as a submanifold of Φ- 1R(0), φi(B) is transversal to every G-orbit; iii): the union [formula] maps surjectively onto   /     /  . In view the local analytic proof of Bertini's theorem in [\cite=gh], we may assume that D is transversal to each φi(B). By G-invariance, it is then transversal to all of Φ- 1R(0).

Let g:D̃s  →  Ds be a G-equivariant resolution of singularities [\cite=eh], [\cite=ev]. For s  ≫  0, [formula] is an ample G-line bundle on D̃s, where F is some effective exceptional divisor. Since [formula] is a regular value of [formula] and belongs to its image, the same holds for the moment map of [formula], for s  ≫  0. Having fixed s  ≫  0, let us also choose r  ≫  0 such that [formula]. The choice of [formula] determines injections

[formula]

This implies the statement by the arguments in § 2, since dim (D̃s) = n - 1.

Given ([\ref=eqn:definition-of-v-mu]), ([\ref=eqn:recursive-inequality]) and Proposition [\ref=prop:divisor-bound], we get

[formula]

Now, in view of ([\ref=eqn:basic-inequality-kmu]), we set [formula] to obtain:

[formula]

The proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:equivariant-del-new] follows by taking [formula] (see [\cite=del], Lemma 3.5).

The arguments used in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:equivariant-del-new] may be applicable in other situations. For example, suppose that L is a G-ample line bundle with [formula]; assume that the equivalence class of L in the G-ample cone [\cite=dh] lies on a face of measure zero, and that - say - the G-ample line bundles in the interior of an adjacent chamber have unstable locus of codimension ≥  2. If A is a G-ample line bundle in the interior of the chamber, one may apply the previous arguments to tensor powers of the form [formula].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:main-general-case].

Given the Kirwan resolution f:  →  M, for m  ≫  0 the equivalence classes of the ample G-line bundles [formula] in the G-ample cone of [formula] all lie to the interior of the same chamber. Therefore, they determine the same GIT quotient 0  =    /     /  . The latter is an (n - g)-dimensional complex projective orbifold, which partially resolves the singularities of M /    /   [\cite=kir2]. Being G-line bundles on [formula], f*(L) and [formula] descend to line orbi-bundles on 0. Fixing G-invariant forms [formula] and Ω- E on [formula] representing the first Chern class of f*(L) and [formula], we obtain forms 0 and Ω- E  0 on 0.

By Corollary [\ref=cor:exceptional], we have

[formula]

By the results in § 2, under the appropriate numerical hypothesis,

[formula]

The statement follows.
