Low- and high-frequency noise from coherent two-level systems

Recent activities and progress with quantum information systems rely on the control of decoherence processes and at the same time provide novel tools to study their mechanisms. Experiments with superconducting qubits revealed the presence of spurious quantum two-level systems [\cite=Simmonds_PRL04] with strong effects on the high-frequency (~  10 GHz) qubit dynamics. Other experiments [\cite=Astafiev] suggested a connection between the strengths of the Ohmic high-frequency noise, responsible for the relaxation of the qubit (T1 decay), and the low-frequency 1 / f noise, which dominates the dephasing (T2 decay). The noise power spectra, extrapolated from the low- and high-frequency sides, cross at ω of order T. This is also compatible with the T2 dependence of the low-frequency part, observed earlier for the 1 / f noise in Josephson devices [\cite=Wellstood_Thesis] [\cite=Wellstood_T2]. Much clearer evidence for the T2 behavior was obtained recently [\cite=Astafiev_Private] [\cite=Wellstood_Clarke].

In this letter we point out that a set of coherent two-level systems (or, in fact, arbitrary quantum systems with discrete spectrum) produces both high- and low-frequency noise with strengths that are naturally related. We show that for a realistic distribution of parameters tunnel TLSs (TTLS) produce noise with experimentally detected features: the 1 / f behavior at low frequencies, the Ohmic ([formula]) high-frequency noise, and the T2 temperature dependence of the integrated weight of the low-frequency noise. This implies that the 1 / f and Ohmic asymptotes cross at ω  ~  T as was indeed observed in Ref. [\cite=Astafiev] at one value of T. The distribution is log-uniform in the tunnel splitting and linear in the bias. Microscopically, this distribution may describe double traps or "Andreev fluctuators" considered recently by Faoro et al. [\cite=Faoro123] in their study of the relaxation (T1 decay) of Josephson qubits due to the high-frequency noise. Our results are obtained for environments with a large number of TLSs which are weakly coupled to the qubit. A strong coupling between a TLS and a qubit can lead to resonances [\cite=Simmonds_PRL04] [\cite=Astafiev].

Ensembles of TLSs were discussed extensively in the literature. On one hand, they produce a natural model of 1 / f noise, as a result of incoherent random transitions [\cite=Dutta_Horn], and there is substantial experimental evidence that the low-frequency 1 / f noise in single-electron devices may be produced by TLSs [\cite=Martinis_Flicker] [\cite=Zorin_Flicker]. In solid-state qubits, e.g., Josephson qubits, the pure dephasing is dominated by this noise [\cite=Nakamura_Echo] [\cite=Saclay_Science] [\cite=Clarke]. On the other hand, ensembles of coherent TTLSs were suggested to explain low-temperature properties of glasses [\cite=AHV_TLS] [\cite=Phillips_TLS]. Both "transverse" and "longitudinal" couplings, defined below, were discussed in relation to various physical phenomena. A transverse coupling of phonons or electrons to the TLSs is responsible for the absorption and emission of energy. It was invoked in the discussions of, e.g., the phonon attenuation [\cite=Black_Review] and of the low-temperature dephasing in disordered metals [\cite=Imry]. On the other hand a longitudinal coupling was found to be responsible, e.g., for the conductance fluctuations [\cite=Kogan] [\cite=Ludviksson] [\cite=Feng]. We suggest that in nanocircuits, e.g., solid-state qubits, both types of couplings play an important part and produce noise with related properties in various frequency ranges.

As a model we consider a set of coherent two-level systems described by the Pauli matrices σp,j, where p = x,y,z and j is the index of a particular TLS. We write the Hamiltonian of the set in the basis defined by their contributions to the relevant fluctuating quantity (cf. Eq. ([\ref=Eq:X]) below);

[formula]

Here, in the language of TTLSs, εj are the bias energies and Δj are the tunnel amplitudes between two states. Each TLS with label j is subject to dissipation due to its own bath with Hamiltonian Hdiss,j. We do not specify Hdiss,j, but only assume that it produces the usual relaxation (T1) and dephasing (T2) processes. We assume that all the TLSs are under-damped, with [formula] and [formula]. Here [formula] is the energy splitting.

Each TLS in the ensemble contributes to fluctuations of a physical quantity X, e.g., the gate charge, which affect an experimentally accessible system and thus may be detected. A qubit may serve as a convenient noise detector [\cite=Aguado] [\cite=SchoelkopfNoiseDetector]. E.g., in the recent experiment of Ref. [\cite=Astafiev] qubits were used to investigate the properties of their environment. We choose

[formula]

where vj are the coupling constants and σz,j  =    ±  1 correspond to the two states differing, e.g., by the value of the dipole moment. The interaction of the qubit with the TLSs is often described via a linear in X coupling to a variable Oqubit of the qubit, i.e., [formula].

Our goal in the following is to investigate the noise properties of X, that is we need to evaluate the (unsymmetrized) correlator

[formula]

For independent TLSs the noise is a sum of individual contributions, [formula], where

[formula]

To obtain Cj we first transform to the eigenbasis of the TLS. This gives

[formula]

and

[formula]

where [formula]. The first term of ([\ref=eq:X]) produces the longitudinal coupling (mentioned above) while the second term produces the transverse one. Using the Bloch-Redfield theory [\cite=Bloch_Derivation] [\cite=Redfield_Derivation] we find readily

[formula]

In thermal equilibrium 〈ρz,j〉  =   tanh (Ej / 2T). The first term, due to the longitudinal part of the coupling, describes random telegraph noise of a thermally excited TLS. We have assumed Γ1,j  ≪  T, so that this term is symmetric (classical). The second term is due to the transverse coupling and describes absorption by the TLS, while the third term describes the transitions of the TLS with emission. We observe that TLSs with Ej  ≫  T contribute to CX only at (positive) ω  =  Ej. Indeed their contribution at ω = 0 is suppressed by the thermal factor 1 - 〈ρz,j〉2  =  1 -  tanh 2(Ej / 2T). Also the negative frequency (emission) contribution at ω  =    -  Ej is suppressed. These high-energy TLSs remain always in their ground state. Only the TLSs with Ej  <  T are thermally excited, performing real random transitions between their two eigenstates, and contribute both at ω  =    ±  Ej and at ω = 0. Such a multi-peaked structure of Cj(ω) was recently discussed in various contexts, e.g., in Refs. [\cite=AverinKorotkov] [\cite=ShnirmanMozyrskyMartin] [\cite=GalperinPeaks]. Note that the separation of the terms in Eq. ([\ref=eq:S_j]) into low- and high-frequency noise is meaningful provided the typical width Γ1,j of the low-ω Lorentzians is lower than the high frequencies of interest, which are defined, e.g., by the qubit's level splitting or temperature.

For a dense distribution of the parameters ε, Δ, and v we can evaluate the low- and high-frequency noise. For positive high frequencies, ω  ≫  T, we obtain

[formula]

where N is the number of fluctuators, P(ε,Δ,v) is the distribution function normalized to 1, [formula], and tan θ  =  Δ  /  ε. Without loss of generality we take ε  ≥  0 and Δ  ≥  0. At negative high frequencies (ω  <  0 and |ω|  >  T) the correlator CX(ω) is exponentially suppressed.

On the other hand, the total weight of the low-frequency (up to [formula]) noise follows from the first term of ([\ref=eq:S_j]). Each Lorentzian contributes 1. Thus we obtain

[formula]

Here we could disregard the contribution of the last two terms for Ej  ~  Γ1,j. Equations ([\ref=eq:CXomega_general]) and ([\ref=eq:intCXlf_general]) provide the general framework for further discussion.

Next we investigate possible distributions for the parameters ε, Δ, and v. We consider a log-uniform distribution of tunnel splittings Δ, with density [formula] in a range
