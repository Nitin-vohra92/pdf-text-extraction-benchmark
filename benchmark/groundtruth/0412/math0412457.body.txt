INTERSECTING JONES PROJECTIONS

Introduction

Let M be a von Neumann algebra on a Hilbert space H and let Ω∈H be a vector of norm 1 which is cyclic and separating for M. Given a family {Ni:i∈I} of von Neumann subalgebras of M it is often useful to consider the closed subspaces [formula] and the corresponding projections [formula]. If N denotes the intersection [formula] and e is the projection of H onto [formula] one always have [formula] namely [formula]. However in general the equality does not hold and in fact it is not hard to give examples with [formula] but ei = 1 for all i∈I even when the set I contains just two elements.

In this paper we prove (see Corollary [\ref=finalcorollary]) that if for every i∈I there is a faithful normal conditional expectation of M onto Ni with [formula], where ω denotes the faithful normal state on M given by ω(  ·  ) = (Ω,  ·  Ω), then [formula].

In a recent paper V.F.R. Jones and F. Xu gave a proof of this equality for a relevant class of examples associated with inclusions of loop groups models of conformal nets on S1 [\cite=JonesXu04]. Moreover, they conjectured that this conclusion is not restricted to specific models but holds in general for inclusions of of completely rational conformal nets [\cite=JonesXu04]. In these examples M is a local algebra of the larger conformal net (a type III1 factor) and Ω is the vacuum vector (if M is a Type II1 factor and the vector state ω is the trace on M the equality holds by [\cite=Skau], cf. [\cite=JonesXu04]).

Our result proves the conjecture of Jones and Xu in [\cite=JonesXu04] and actually shows that assumption (2) in [\cite=JonesXu04] is not needed.

The proof we shall give is partially inspired by the one given in [\cite=JonesXu04]. The main new idea is to replace the smeared vertex operators used in [\cite=JonesXu04] by suitable closed operators provided by the Tomita-Takesaki modular theory. In fact we shall prove a more general result (Theorem [\ref=maintheorem]) where a normal semifinite normal weight on the von Neumann algebra M is given instead of the vector state ω.

Preliminaries and notations

Let M be a von Neumann algebra and let φ be a normal semifinite faithful (n.s.f.) weight on M. Then the set

[formula]

is σ-weakly dense left ideal of M. [formula] with the inner product (x,y) = φ(x*y) can be completed to a complex Hilbert space Hφ. Accordingly [formula] will be considered as a dense subspace of Hφ via the mapping [formula] so that for [formula] we have (xφ,yφ) = φ(x*y). The GNS representation πφ of M on Hφ is determined by πφ(x)yφ  =  (xy)φ for all x∈M and [formula]. Then πφ is normal and faithful i.e. a [formula]-isomorphism of M onto the von Neumann algebra [formula] (see [\cite=Stratila]).

The set [formula] is a σ-weakly dense self-adjoint subalgebra [formula] of M which can also be considered as a dense subspace of Hφ. The antilinear operator S0φ on Hφ with domain [formula], defined by

[formula]

is preclosed and we denote its closure by Sφ. The modular operator Δφ = S*φSφ and the modular conjugation Jφ associated with M and φ are obtained from the polar decomposition Sφ = JφΔ1 / 2φ of Sφ. Moreover the following fundamental relations hold

[formula]

and the modular automorphism group [formula] of M associated with φ is defined by

[formula]

For every η∈Hφ one defines a linear operator R0η on Hφ with domain [formula] by

[formula]

If η is in the domain D(S*φ) of S*φ then R0η is preclosed and its closure Rη is affiliated with πφ(M)', see [\cite=Stratila]. The subset [formula] defined by

[formula]

is a dense subspace of Hφ and the set [formula] is a σ-weakly dense self-adjoint subalgebra of πφ(M)'.

Similarly, for every ξ∈Hφ one defines a linear operator L0ξ on Hφ with domain [formula] by

[formula]

If ξ is in the domain D(Sφ) of Sφ then L0ξ is preclosed and its closure Lξ is affiliated with πφ(M).

The operators Lξ,  ξ∈D(Sφ), which in general can be unbounded, will play a crucial role in the proof of our main result.

We conclude this section with a proposition (cf. [\cite=Skau]). which we shall need later.

Let {Ri:i∈I} be a family of von Neumann algebras on a Hilbert space H and let T be a closed linear operator on H. If T is affiliated with Ri for every i∈I then T is also affiliated with [formula].

Let A be the unital self-adjoint subalgebra of [formula] generated by the union of the algebras Ri',i∈I. If x∈A then xT  ⊂  Tx. Now A'' = R' and thus A is strong-operator dense in R'. For x∈R' let xλ be a net in A converging to x in the strong-operator topology. If ξ is in the domain D(T) of T then xλξ∈D(T) and Txλξ  =  xλTξ for each λ. Hence lim xλξ = xξ and lim Txλξ = xTξ. Since T is closed it follows that xξ∈D(T) and Txξ = xTξ. Hence xT  ⊂  Tx for every x∈R' namely T is affiliated with R.

Results

Let M be a von Neumann algebra and let φ be a n.s.f. weight on M. If N is a von Neumann subalgebra of M we can define a closed subspace HN of Hφ by

[formula]

For all x∈N we have [formula] and hence HN is invariant for πφ(N).

If σφt(N) = N for all [formula] and the restriction ψ of φ to N is semifinite we say that N is a modular covariant von Neumann subalgebra of M relatively to φ or simply a modular covariant subalgebra if the corresponding weight on M is unambiguously defined from the context. Note that if φ is a state, i.e. φ(1) = 1, then N  ⊂  M is modular covariant iff σφt(N) = N for all [formula].

A von Neumann subalgebra N  ⊂  M is modular covariant if and only if there exists a faithful normal conditional expectation E of M onto N such that [formula], namely φ(x) = φ(E(x)) for each positive element x of M [\cite=Takesaki72] (see also [\cite=Stratila]). In this case the conditional expectation E is completely determined by

[formula]

where e denotes the projection of Hφ onto HN (the Jones projection), and the fact that HN is separating for πφ(M), being [formula] σ-weakly dense in N.

Let φ be a n.s.f. weight on the von Neumann algebra M. If N  ⊂  M is a modular covariant von Neumann subalgebra and e is the corresponding Jones projection then

[formula]

From the fact that HN is invariant for πφ(N) it follows that e∈πφ(N)'. Assume now that x∈M and that πφ(x) commutes with e. Then it follows from Eq. ([\ref=Ee]) that πφ(E(x) - x)e = 0 and hence, being HN separating for πφ(M) and πφ faithful, that x = E(x)∈N.

Let M, φ and N be as in the previous lemma and for ξ∈D(Sφ) let Lξ be the closed operator affiliated with πφ(M) defined after Eq. ([\ref=l0xi]). Then Lξ is affiliated with πφ(N) for all [formula].

Let [formula]. Since we know that Lξ is a closed operator affiliated with πφ(M) and by Lemma [\ref=eprime] [formula] it follows from Proposition [\ref=affiliatedprop] that it is enough to show that Lξ is affiliated with {e}' namely that eLξ  ⊂  Lξe.

From eJφ  =  Jφe (see pag. 131 of [\cite=Stratila]) and [formula] [\cite=Stratila] it follows that [formula]. Now, for every [formula] we have [formula] and exφ = E(x)φ , see [\cite=Stratila]. Since E is a self-adjoint map it follows that [formula] and hence that [formula]. Given [formula] , [formula] we have

[formula]

Since Rη and Reη are bounded and [formula] is dense in Hφ it follows that eRηe = Reηe for every [formula]. Hence, using the assumption that ξ  =  eξ, for every [formula] we find

[formula]

and the conclusion follows from the fact that [formula] is a core for Lξ.

We are now ready prove the main result of this paper.

Let M be a von Neumann algebra with a n.s.f. weight φ and let {Ni:i∈I} be a family of modular covariant von Neumann subalgebras of M with Jones projections {ei:i∈I}. Assume that the restriction of φ to [formula] is semifinite. Then N is a modular covariant subalgebra of M with Jones projection e satisfying [formula]

We have to show that [formula]. For all i∈I we have [formula] and hence [formula]. To prove the other inclusion let us consider the projection f of Hφ onto [formula]. Since eiΔφ  ⊂  Δφei (see pag. 131 of [\cite=Stratila]), Δφ is affiliated with {ei}' for each i∈I and hence, by Proposition [\ref=affiliatedprop] it is affiliated with [formula]. It follows that fΔ1 / 2φ  ⊂  Δ1 / 2φf and thus that [formula].

Now let ξ∈D(Sφ). Then [formula] and by Propositions [\ref=affiliatedprop] and [\ref=lxiprop] Lfξ is affiliated with [formula]. It follows that eLfξ  ⊂  Lfξe and hence that eRηfξ  =  Reηfξ for every [formula]. Thus, using the fact that [formula], we find ReJφxφfξ∈eHφ for all [formula]. From the equalities RJφyφ = Jφπφ(y)Jφ, [formula] (see pag. 26 of [\cite=Stratila]) and Jφe  =  eJφ it follows that Jφπφ(E(x))Jφfξ∈eHφ for every [formula], where E is the faithful normal conditional expectation of M onto N satisfying [formula]. Hence, being [formula] σ-weakly dense in M and E normal, we find fξ∈eHφ  =  HN. Since ξ∈D(Sφ) was arbitrary we can conclude that fHφ  ⊂  HN.

Let M be a von Neumann algebra on a Hilbert space H with a cyclic and separating unit vector Ω and let ω be the faithful normal state on M given by ω(  ·  ) = (Ω,  ·  Ω). Assume that for a given family {Ni:i∈I} of von Neumann subalgebras of M there exist faithful normal conditional expectations Ei of M onto Ni satisfying [formula] for all i∈I and let [formula]. Then the Jones projections ei, e of H onto the closed subspaces [formula] and [formula] respectively satisfy [formula].
