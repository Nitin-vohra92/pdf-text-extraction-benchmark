ABSTRACT

The recent mathematical literature introduces generalised geometries which are defined by a reduction from the structure group SO(d,d) of the vector bundle [formula] to a special subgroup. In this article we show that compactification of IIB superstring vacua on 7-manifolds with two covariantly constant spinors leads to a generalised G2-structure associated with a reduction from SO(7,7) to G2  ×  G2. We also consider compactifications on 6-manifolds where analogously we obtain a generalised SU(3)-structure associated with SU(3)  ×  SU(3), and show how these relate to generalised G2-structures.

Introduction

From a duality and a phenomenological point of view, the idea of compactifying superstring theories and M-theory is a rather appealing one. It also points to interesting geometrical issues as requiring a certain amount of supersymmetry to be preserved puts constraints on the internal background geometry and thus leads to special G-structures. For instance, compactification on a 7- or 6-manifold together with [formula] supersymmetry yields a dilaton and a Killing spinor equation which induces a G2- or SU(3)-structure with various non-trivial torsion classes.

For [formula] supersymmetry we basically need two special G-structures inside a given metric structure [\cite=gmw04]. This naturally makes one consider the class of so-called generalised geometries, a concept which goes back to [\cite=hi01]. Over a d-manifold Md, contraction on the vector bundle [formula] defines an inner product of signature (d,d) and therefore induces an SO(d,d)-structure over Md. A generalised geometry is then described by the (topological) reduction to a special subgroup of SO(d,d) together with a suitable integrability condition. In many situations, this can then be rephrased by the existence of two G-structures with prescribed torsion classes and which sit inside a given principal SO(n)- or Spin(n)-fibre bundle (cf. [\cite=gu03], [\cite=wi04]).

In the present article we investigate type IIB superstring vacua by compactifying on seven and six dimensional manifolds. We shall focus on the geometrical structure of the vacuum space admitting a certain amount of supersymmetry in the external space, which can be achieved by a spinorial formulation of the supersymmetry variations. An additional analysis of the equations of motion single out physical vacua.

As we will explain, considering the "doubled" vector bundle [formula] accounts for [formula] supersymmetry by reducing the structure group from SO(7,7) or SO(6,6) to G2  ×  G2 or SU(3)  ×  SU(3) in the same way as compactification with [formula] supersymmetry is accounted for by a reduction from the structure group SO(7) or SO(6) to G2 or SU(3). Our starting point are the papers [\cite=ha00], [\cite=ha99], [\cite=has00], where Hassan investigated T-duality issues along d directions. This naturally leads to the consideration of "general" supersymmetry transformations invariant under the action of the so-called generalised T-duality or Narain group SO(d,d). Here, "generalised" means that we treat the left- and right-moving sectors of the worldsheet independently under the supersymmetry variations. This is similar in spirit to the investigation of topologically twisted non-linear sigma models on target spaces admitting a generalised complex structure in the sense of Hitchin [\cite=hi03] and Gualtieri [\cite=gu03], see for instance  [\cite=cgj04], [\cite=gahuro84], [\cite=kali04], [\cite=ka03].

By taking Hassan's supersymmetry variations, we see that preserving supersymmetry on the external space requires the variations of the gravitinos Ψ±  X and dilatinos λ± to vanish, i.e.

[formula]

These equations were also derived by Gauntlett et al. [\cite=gmpw04] from the perspective of wrapped NS5-branes in IIB supergravity. There, the authors found a solution by assuming N = 2 supersymmetry in dimension d = 3 from a classical SU(3)-structure point of view.

In this article we shall then proceed as follows. In Section [\ref=prelim] we introduce the generalised supersymmetry variations of type IIB following [\cite=ha00], [\cite=ha99] and [\cite=has00]. Neglecting the action of the RR-sector we use standard compactification methods in Section [\ref=compactification] to obtain the model [formula] together with the equations

[formula]

for two spinors η± on the internal background. In section [\ref=geng2] we will discuss the notion of a generalised G2-structure [\cite=wi04] and give an equivalent formulation of equations ([\ref=dil_kill]) by means of differential forms of mixed degree. As a quick illustration we shall apply this formulation to the setup taken from [\cite=gmpw04] in Section [\ref=su3]. We then discuss compactifications on 6-manifolds which lead to generalised SU(3)-structures in Section [\ref=gensu3]. Issues about lifting string theory to generalised topological M-theory admitting a generalised G2-structure (see for instance [\cite=dgnv04]) naturally rises the question about the relation between generalised G2- and SU(3)-structures which will be addressed in Section [\ref=genflow].

The authors would like to acknowledge S.F. Hassan and R. Blumenhagen for useful discussions. Some ideas are based on the second author's doctoral thesis [\cite=wi05] who wishes to thank his supervisor Nigel Hitchin.

Preliminaries

We briefly set up the notation for the type IIB theory following Hassan [\cite=ha00] (see also [\cite=ha99], [\cite=has00]). Let us consider the gravitinos Ψ±, the dilatinos λ± and the supersymmetry parameters ε±. They all arise as the real and imaginary part of the complex Weyl spinors

[formula]

The gravitinos (of spin 3 / 2) and the dilatinos (of spin 1 / 2) originate from the (R,NS)- and (NS,R)-sectors. We shall use an additional subscript +  /  -  to indicate if the R-spin representation is induced by the left or right moving sector. For instance, Ψ+ X comes from the (R,NS)-sector.

In the following we want to treat the left and right moving sector independently with respect to space-time supersymmetry and we therefore introduce two supersymmetry variations δ±. In particular, δ+ and δ- act only on the left and right moving sectors and interchange R  ↔  NS. Both the supersymmetry parameters ε± and the gravitinos Ψ± are supposed to be of positive chirality, i.e.

[formula]

while

[formula]

that is λ± is of negative chirality. We shall neglect the action of the RR-fields and consider only the closed NS-NS 3-form flux H, i.e. dH = 0, and the dilaton Φ. Therefore the supersymmetry variations of the (R,NS)- and (NS,R)-sector are given by

[formula]

The vanishing of the supersymmetry variations, that is

[formula]

is necessary to characterise the background manifold M1,9 in the vacuum case. To find a solution to ([\ref=susyvar]), we shall make specific assumptions which will occupy us next.

Compactification on M7

In this section, we compactify the theory on a 7-manifold M7, that is we consider the direct product model [formula] where H and φ take non-trivial values only over M7. We want to determine the constraints on the underlying geometry of the internal space M7 imposed by the vanishing of the supersymmetry variations ([\ref=susyvar]).

To that end, we decompose the supersymmetry parameters ε±∈Δ±M1,9 accordingly, that is

[formula]

where ξ and η live in the irreducible spin representation [formula] and [formula] of Spin(1,2) and Spin(7) respectively, and [formula].

We fix the 10-dimensional space-time coordinates XM (M=0,,9) and assume the background fields to be independent of Xμ (μ = 0,1,2). Coordinates on the internal space will be labeled by Xa for [formula]. We use the convention

[formula]

with signature [formula]. We choose the explicit gamma matrix representation

[formula]

where the (8  ×  8)-matrices γa are imaginary. The SO(1,2) gamma matrices γμ and the Pauli matrices σi are given by

[formula]

and

[formula]

Furthermore, we note the relations

[formula]

The chirality operator Γ11 is therefore [formula].

With these splittings at hand we want to carry out the supersymmetry variations ([\ref=susy]). The external part of the dilatino variation vanishes trivially. For the internal part, we first note the useful identity

[formula]

by means of which we immediately obtain the dilatino variations

[formula]

The condition δ±λ±  =  0 is then equivalent to

[formula]

Next we focus on the variation of the gravitinos δ±Ψ±    M. The flatness of [formula] implies

[formula]

This solves the external part, and consequently we are left with

[formula]

Imposing the condition δ±Ψ±    X = 0 finally yields

[formula]

In this article we shall deal with the case N = 1, i.e. with exactly two internal spinors η±. Hence a solution consists of the internal background data (M7,g,H,η±,φ) satisfying ([\ref=dilaton]) and ([\ref=genkill]), where g is a metric, H a closed 3-form, η± two unit spinors in the associated irreducible spin representation [formula] and φ a scalar function.

Note that the considerations above can be easily modified to tackle the case of non-chiral type IIA theory which results in similar geometric conditions.

Generalised G2-structures

In this section we want to formulate the geometry of the internal space M7 in the language of generalised G2-structures which we are going to define next. For details and proofs of the facts below we refer to [\cite=wi04], [\cite=wi05] where these structures where introduced.

Contraction on the vector bundle [formula] over an arbitrary d-manifold defines a natural inner product of signature (d,d) and induces a spinnable SO(d,d)-structure. An element [formula] acts on a form τ∈Λ* by

[formula]

As this squares to minus the identity, we obtain an isomorphism between [formula] and [formula]. Moreover, the irreducible spin representations of Spin(d,d) can be realised as

[formula]

In this way, an even or odd form ρ may be regarded as a spinor for [formula]. In dimension 7, we call the pair (M7,ρ) a generalised G2-manifold if the stabiliser of the even or odd form ρ is conjugate to G2  ×  G2 inside Spin(7,7). Since a 2-form b can be naturally identified with an element in the Lie algebra [formula], it acts on S± by wedging with the exponential [formula]. Hence, if ρ defines a generalised G2-manifold, so does the transformed spinor [formula]. This displays a crucial feature of generalised geometries, namely that these can be naturally transformed by the action of both diffeomorphisms and 2-forms (cf. also [\cite=hi03] and [\cite=gu03]).

The data of the previous section links into the generalised setup as follows. Consider a Riemannian 7-manifold (M7,g) together with two unit spinors η+ and η- living in the spinor bundle associated with a fixed spin structure over M7 and the irreducible Spin(7)-representation [formula]. In terms of G-structures, it is a well-known fact that each spinor induces a reduction to a principal G2-fibre bundle inside this spin structure. For sake of clarity, we denote the associated structure groups by G2  ±. The group G2 +  ×  G2 - then fixes the element [formula] inside the irreducible Spin(7)  ×  Spin(7)-representation space [formula]. On the other hand, these groups also act on Λev,od via the inclusion into Spin(7,7). In order to compare these two actions we write

[formula]

where the isomorphism is given by extension of the map

[formula]

and [formula] now also denotes multiplication in [formula]. Let [formula] represent the even or odd part of the form obtained through fierzing and let ·   denote Clifford multiplication in [formula]. One can show that

[formula]

for any [formula]. Hence the G2 +  ×  G2 --invariant tensor product [formula] induces elements ρev,od0∈S± whose stabiliser inside Spin(7,7) is conjugate to G2  ×  G2.

A particular instance of this construction was carried out in [\cite=gmpw04] where the authors considered the case of two orthogonal spinors η+ and η-, that is, the structure group reduces to an honest [formula]. In our situation, the choice of the two spinors is perfectly general. To fully appreciate that point, define the spinor [formula] which is orthogonal to η+. It induces a vector field determined by the relation [formula]. Outside the zero locus of X, the pair [formula] induces an SU(3)-structure on M which breaks down precisely when η+ and η- are parallel, that is, [formula]. This is also reflected in the following explicit description of ρev,od0 in terms of the underlying [formula]-invariants. The coefficients of the form [formula] can be computed by

[formula]

where q denotes a suitably scaled Spin(7)-invariant inner product on [formula] and [formula] is a multi-index of an orthonormal basis for g. Since Spin(7) acts transitively on the set of pairs of orthonormal spinors, we may choose an orthonormal basis in [formula] such that

[formula]

If the spinors η+ and η- are linearly independent, their isotropy groups G2 + and G2 - intersect in SU(3) which fixes a 1-form α = e7, a symplectic form ω = e12 + e34 + e56 and two 3-forms ψ+ = e135 - e146 - e236 - e245 and ψ- = e136 + e145 + e235 - e246. These are the real and the imaginary part of the SU(3)-invariant holomorphic volume form [\cite=chsa02]. We then find

[formula]

where c and s are shorthand for cos (a) and sin (a), and [formula] describes the angle between the spinors η+ and η-. The underlying SU(3)-structure fluctuates with a and breaks down when s = 0, i.e. the spinors are parallel. Consequently, only the forms sα, sω etc. are globally defined over M7 and it follows that in general the SO(7)-structure does not reduce to a global "static" SU(3)-structure. Moreover, at a point where a = 0, i.e. η  =  η+  =  η-, we have

[formula]

with φ denoting the invariant 3-form of the G2-structure defined by η. This explicit description also reveals how to relate the G2  ×  G2-invariant forms ρev0 and ρod0. For a p-form ξp, define σ(ξp) to be 1 for [formula] and - 1 for [formula]. A direct computation shows that

[formula]

In general, a G2  ×  G2-invariant spinor ρ in S+ or S- determines a metric g and a 2-form b for which it can be uniquely written (up to a sign) as

[formula]

Therefore, any generalised G2-manifold can be equivalently characterised by the set of data (M7,g,b,η±,φ). We refer to the induced 2-form b as the B-field of the generalised G2-structure. In order to relate ρev with ρod we introduce the generalised Hodge- or box operator [formula] defined by

[formula]

One can then show that

[formula]

For sake of concreteness, we usually assume the G2  ×  G2-invariant spinor ρ to be even and write ρ0 for the B-field free form [formula] given by ([\ref=rhoeven]). We shall also use the sloppier notation [formula] for [formula] if g and b are induced by ρ. Note that the

[formula]

degrees of freedom sum to 64 =  dim  Λev,od, so that this data effectively parametrises the open orbit of a G2  ×  G2-invariant form under the action of [formula]. Following the language in [\cite=hi01] such a spinor is called stable. Stability allows us to consider a certain variational principle introduced by Hitchin [\cite=hi01] which also gained some attraction with a view towards a topological M-theory [\cite=dgnv04], [\cite=pewi05]. The variation takes place over a dH-cohomology class, where H is a closed 3-form and [formula]. If ρ is dH-closed, then it defines a critical point for this variational problem if and only if [formula]. Note that if the spinors η+ and η- are equal and H = 0, this equation reduces to the classical condition [formula] [\cite=hi01]. To see how this relates to ([\ref=dilaton]) and ([\ref=genkill]), recall that the twisted Dirac operator over [formula] transforms into [formula] under fierzing. A more general argument taking into account the action of the 3-from H can then be invoked to show that (M7,g,H,η±,φ) satisfies ([\ref=dilaton]) and ([\ref=genkill]) if and only if the corresponding G2  ×  G2-invariant spinor [formula] satisfies

[formula]

that is, e-  φρ0 defines a critical point. In particular, we see that as a integrability condition we need

[formula]

If H is globally exact, i.e. H = db, ([\ref=critpoint]) can be written in the more succinct form

[formula]

Recovering the classical SU(3)-case

Equations ([\ref=dilaton]) and ([\ref=genkill]) were first derived by Gauntlett et al. [\cite=gmpw04] from a quite different point of view. Starting with IIB supergravity they studied wrapped NS5-branes over calibrated submanifolds inside an internal 7-manifold with an SU(3)-structure. As an illustration of the previous section, we reconsider their setup which turns out to be described by a "static" generalised G2-structure with [formula] (that is, the structure group reduces to a fixed SU(3)), together with an additional closed 3-form, the NS-NS flux H.

Under this assumption the form ρ defining the generalised G2-structure becomes

[formula]

with associated odd form

[formula]

The supersymmetry equations are equivalent to

[formula]

which written in homogeneous components can then be rephrased by

[formula]

and

[formula]

We finally conclude

[formula]

The equations of motion are solved since H is closed, i.e. dH = 0, as proved in [\cite=gmpw04]. Therefore ([\ref=finalres]) characterises the physical vacua.

Compactification on M6 and generalised SU(3)-structures

Following the procedure of Section [\ref=compactification] we can also compactify on a 6-dimensional manifold M6. Recall that we have Spin(6) = SU(4) and that the irreducible spin representations of positive and negative chirality Δ± are just the SU(4)-vector representation [formula] and its conjugate [formula]. The supersymmetry equations compactified on M6 thus become

[formula]

for two complex spinors η±. Since we work in type IIB theory both η+ and η- are assumed to be of positive chirality. Similarly, we can consider type IIA theory by choosing the spinors to be non-chiral.

Recall that SU(4) / SU(3) = S7, hence the choice of two unit spinors [formula] induces a reduction to two SU(3)±-subbundles. The SU(4)-representations Δ± decompose into [formula] and [formula]. Consequently, we can also consider the corresponding SU(3)±-invariant spinors [formula]. We want to describe the data (M6,g,H,η±,φ) in the language of generalised geometry where it gives rise to a generalised SU(3)-structure. This is completely analogous to Section [\ref=geng2] and the proofs of [\cite=wi04] carry over without difficulty. Again we content ourselves with a brief outline of the corresponding results.

Rather than working with the complex spinors we will consider the real SU(4)-module S obtained by forgetting the complex structure on [formula] or [formula], that is the complexification of S is just [formula]. Note that the Riemannian volume element volg induces a complex structure on S and acts on [formula] and [formula] by multiplication with i and - i respectively. We let

[formula]

so that

[formula]

Since S carries an SU(4)-invariant Riemannian inner product, we can identify [formula] with Λ*T6 * through fierzing so that ([\ref=lmap]) holds. This yields two forms [formula] and [formula] which we can interpret as SU(3)  ×  SU(3)-invariant spinors and which we want to decompose into an even and an odd part. Note that under complexification of this isomorphism, the components [formula] and [formula] get mapped onto odd complex forms, while the off-diagonal components [formula] and [formula] become even since [formula] and [formula] are dual to each other. Writing [formula] etc. we obtain

[formula]

To see how these forms relate to each other, we note that in dimension 6 the [formula]-operator respects the parity of the forms and satisfies [formula], that is [formula] induces a complex structure on Λ*T* (it is effectively the [formula]-operator introduced in [\cite=hi03]). We then have

[formula]

where [formula] etc..

As in Section [\ref=geng2] we can compute a normal form description which we can express in terms of the underlying [formula]-invariants if the unit spinors η± are linearly independent. Using again the complexified isomorphism [formula] and decomposing [formula] with two complex scalars [formula] we find

[formula]

and

[formula]

where expressed in a suitable local orthonormal basis [formula] we have the two real 1-forms α = e5, β = e6, the complex 1-form Z = e5 + ie6, the self-dual 2-forms ω1 = e12 + e34, ω2 = e13 - e24, ω3 = e14 + e23 and the complex symplectic form Ω  =  ω2 - iω3. The normal forms of [formula] and [formula] are obtained by complex conjugation in [formula].

Finally we wish to state the supersymmetry equations ([\ref=susy6dim]) in terms of the SU(3)  ×  SU(3)-invariant forms τ0, 0, υ and [formula]. The real version of ([\ref=susy6dim]) is given by

[formula]

and

[formula]

The same computation as in the generalised G2-case shows that this is equivalent to

[formula]

that is

[formula]

If H is globally exact, that is H = db, we can write these equations more succinctly as

[formula]

Dimension 6 vs. 7

The inclusion SU(3)  ⊂  G2 allows one to pass from an SU(3)-structure in dim  = 6 to a G2-structure in dim  = 7. In the same vein, the inclusion SU(3)  ×  SU(3)  ⊂  G2  ×  G2 relates generalised SU(3)- to generalised G2-structures. In this final section we want to render this link explicit in both the spinorial and the form picture of a generalised structure. We first discuss the algebraic setup before we turn to integrability issues.

To start with, assume that we are given a generalised G2-structure (T,g,b,η±,φ) over the 7-dimensional vector space T7 = T together with a preferred unit vector α. We want to induce a generalised SU(3)-structure on [formula] defined by [formula]. Since α  ·  α =  - 1, the choice of such a vector induces a complex structure on the irreducible Spin(7)-module [formula] which is compatible with the spin-invariant Riemannian inner product. Hence the complexification of [formula] is

[formula]

where

[formula]

The choice of α also induces a reduction from SO(7) to SO(6) which is covered by Spin(6) = SU(4), and as an SU(4)-module we have [formula] and [formula]. We define

[formula]

and let [formula] and [formula]. Then a generalised SU(3)-structure over [formula] is given by [formula]. Moreover, we get a (possibly zero) 1-form [formula]. It is clear that we can reverse this construction by defining a metric [formula], [formula] and two spinors [formula] through [formula].

To see what happens in the form picture, we start with the special G2  ×  G2-invariant form

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula]. It follows from ([\ref=lmap]) that

[formula]

Therefore the forms f0 and f1 can be expressed by

[formula]

and

[formula]

Using the spinors ψ± as defined above we find

[formula]

Consequently, we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

In the same vein, decomposing [formula] yields

[formula]

and

[formula]

In presence of a non-trivial B-field b∈Λ2T* we write [formula]. Since [formula] we obtain for the general case the expressions

[formula]

and

[formula]

Conversely, if (T,g,b,ρ0,φ) defines a generalised G2-structure and α∈T is a unit vector, then the forms [formula], [formula] and [formula] define a generalised SU(3)-structure [formula] with [formula].

To see how the integrability conditions relate to each other over the manifolds M7 = M and [formula], consider a smooth family [formula] of metrics [formula], of 2-forms [formula], of even and odd forms τ0(t) and υ0(t) and of scalar functions φ(t) which we assume to define a generalised SU(3)-structure for any t lying in some open interval I. Moreover, we consider a curve of 1-forms [formula]. In order to obtain an integrable generalised G2-structure over [formula] defined by [formula] where [formula], [formula], [formula] and φ  =  φ(t), we need to solve the equations

[formula]

We decompose the exterior differential d over [formula] into

[formula]

where [formula] is the exterior differential on [formula]. From ([\ref=g2su3rho]) we conclude the first equation to be equivalent to

[formula]

so that

[formula]

By ([\ref=g2su3boxrho]) the second equation reads

[formula]

and therefore yields

[formula]

If we let [formula] we can bring ([\ref=cond1]) and ([\ref=cond2]) into Hamiltonian form, that is the generalised G2-structure is integrable if and only if

[formula]

We illustrate the previous discussion by considering a classical SU(3)-structure defined by a unit spinor η and taking the generalised SU(3)-structure given by (M6,g,η) with trivial B-field and vanishing dilaton, i.e. b = 0 and φ = 0. We can compute the forms τ0 etc. by using the normal form description ([\ref=normform6dim1]) and ([\ref=normform6dim2]) where c1 = 1 and c2 = 0. Using the notation of [\cite=chsa02] and Section [\ref=geng2] we obtain

[formula]

and equations ([\ref=flow]) become the Hitchin flow equations

[formula]

which appeared in [\cite=chsa02] and go back to [\cite=hi01]. Note that although equations ([\ref=flow]) are, like the Hitchin flow equations, in Hamiltonian form we have not shown yet that if the data [formula] defines a generalised SU(3)-structure at t = t0 and satisfies ([\ref=flow]), then it automatically defines a generalised SU(3)-structure for t > t0, as it is the case for classical SU(3)-structures evolving along the Hitchin flow.
