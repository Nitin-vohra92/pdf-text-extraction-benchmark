Matching functions for heavy particles

Introduction

Decoupling a heavy quark when the renormalization scheme is mass independent was originally discussed by Witten [\cite=witten]. He showed that the results can be elegantly expressed in terms of a renormalization group (RG) invariant running coupling [formula] associated with the mass mh of the heavy quark h. Subsequently, Bernreuther and Wetzel [\cite=BW] [\cite=wetzel] [\cite=B1] [\cite=B2] proposed a systematic method for dealing with the matching problem, i.e. the lack of explicit decoupling in mass independent schemes. They applied the Appelquist-Carrazone decoupling theorem [\cite=AC] to the gluon coupling αMOQ in the momentum subtraction (MO) scheme, i.e. renormalized at space-like momentum Q

[formula]

and compared calculations of [formula] in the full F = f + 1 and effective f flavor [formula] (modified minimal subtraction) theories. When O(m- 1h) terms are neglected, the strong coupling αF  =  g2F / (4π) for the F-flavor [formula] theory is calculable as a power series in its f-flavor counterpart αf and logarithms of mh. Results for the first few loops of perturbation theory appear in the literature [\cite=BW] [\cite=wetzel] [\cite=B1] [\cite=B2] [\cite=larin] [\cite=CKS1] [\cite=rodrigo]. Bernreuther has constructed a similar matching procedure to deal with the effects of mass renormalization [\cite=B1].

This paper arises from the observation [\cite=BW] [\cite=B1] that the RG relates coefficients of perturbative mass logarithms ~  αrF ln smh in matching relations. This suggests that we seek an analogy with the behavior of Green's functions at large momenta q, where in general [\cite=GML] [\cite=IZ], each perturbative order in the Gell-Mann-Low function Ψ(x) or the Callan-Symanzik β,γ,δ functions determines all coefficients to logarithmic order κ, i.e.  all coefficients of momentum logarithms [formula].

We set up the formalism for mass logarithms by introducing matching functions [formula] and [formula] associated with coupling constant and mass renormalization. The coupling constant and masses are matched to all orders, with heavy quarks (in this article) decoupled one by one (F = f + 1). For coupling constant renormalization, we derive in Sec. [\ref=mf] the following key equations,

[formula]

where h is Witten's renormalization group invariant heavy-quark mass [\cite=witten], βf(x) is the [formula] β-function for the f-flavor theory, and

[formula]

is the [formula] scale derived from the scale [formula] used to define dimensional regularization and renormalization. The matching function FF  →  f is a series in [formula] whose coefficients can be determined perturbatively by comparison with ([\ref=aa1]). The desired matching relation between αF and αf is the result of eliminating [formula] from Eqs. ([\ref=c8]) and ([\ref=c9]):

[formula]

Similar conditions for mass matching are presented in Sec. [\ref=mmf].

The role played by F, G and the β,γ,δ functions in matching conditions is just like that of the β,γ,δ functions for large-momentum logarithms. Each order of perturbation theory for these functions determines the coefficients of a new tower of mass logarithms: leading order (LO), next-to-leading order (NLO), next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO), and so on. Both [formula] and [formula] vanish for LO and NLO, but then there are contributions from successive terms in their power series in [formula], starting with NNLO for [formula] and NNNLO for [formula].

We find, as for large-q logarithms, that results for coupling constants, running couplings and light masses can be most elegantly expressed as closed expressions or generating functions for summed towers of mass logarithms. Examples are the decoupling formulas for αf + 1 and [formula] quoted previously by us [\cite=BCST], which we derive in Sec. [\ref=ce]. Almost all of our results are for quantum chromodynamics (QCD) with three colors, but the technique can be applied to any renormalizable theory.

Sections [\ref=wm] and [\ref=mcc] are brief summaries of Witten's treatment of heavy-quark decoupling in QCD and the matching procedure of Bernreuther and Wetzel for coupling constants. This lays the foundation for the RG analysis in Sec. [\ref=mf], from which we are led to construct the matching function F for coupling constant renormalization. Perturbation theory for F is considered in Sec. [\ref=pt], with the result that the first non-zero term (NNLO) in F is obtained. In Sec. [\ref=ce], we show that Eqs. ([\ref=c8]) and ([\ref=c9]) lead directly to closed expressions for heavy-quark logarithms to a given logarithmic order, and present explicit NLO expressions. Section [\ref=mmf] is an extension of our RG analysis to deal with the matching problem for mass renormalization. It is here that we introduce the mass-matching function G. In Sec. [\ref=asd], we decouple more than one heavy quark sequentially, for example ln (mt  /  μ̄)  ≫   ln (mb  /  μ̄)  →    ∞  , and derive the NLO closed formula for coupling constant renormalization in this limit.

Section [\ref=nonAF] suggests that the consistency of theories lacking asymptotic freedom, such as quantum electrodynamics (QED) with heavy leptons, be tested by imposing the physical requirement that all heavy particles decouple in the infinite-mass limit. Both ultra-violet and infra-red stable fixed points enter the analysis.

Other applications of our technique are discussed in the concluding Sec. [\ref=c].

Witten's Method

This section summarizes some key points of Witten's procedure [\cite=witten] [\cite=BCST].

By convention, the same [formula] scale μ̄ is used for the initial F-flavor and all residual f-flavor theories. Whenever heavy quarks (masses mh) are decoupled,

[formula]

all parameters of the residual f-flavor theory are held fixed: the scale μ̄, all momenta [formula], the coupling αf, and all light-quark masses mlf. In any order of perturbation theory, amplitudes

[formula]

are power series in [formula] with each power modified by a polynomial in ln (mh  /  μ̄). We will consider the leading power [formula]:

[formula]

The notation O(m- 1h) refers to any sub-leading power, including its logarithmic modifications.

Logarithms in [formula] for mh  ~    ∞   are generated by 1PI (one-particle irreducible) subgraphs with at least one heavy-quark propagator and with degree of divergence at least logarithmic. It is as if all contributing 1PI parts were shrunk to a point. All F-flavor amplitudes [formula] tend to amplitudes Af of the residual f-flavor theory, apart from mh-dependent renormalizations of the coupling constant, light masses, and amplitudes [\cite=AC]:

[formula]

For practical applications, Eq. ([\ref=a1]) has to be inverted, so that αf and mlf become the dependent variables instead of αF and mlF. That is because we hold αf and mlf fixed as mh  →    ∞  .

For any number of flavors f (including F), let

[formula]

be the corresponding Callan-Symanzik operator. Since AF satisfies an F-flavor improved Callan-Symanzik equation [\cite=hooft], so also does its leading power:

[formula]

In general, both γF and [formula] are matrices.

If we substitute ([\ref=a]) in ([\ref=d]) and change variables,

[formula]

the result is an improved Callan-Symanzik equation for each residual amplitude,

[formula]

where the functions [\cite=witten] [\cite=BW]

[formula]

depend solely on αf. The absence of ml dependence in the renormalization factors in ([\ref=a]) and ([\ref=a1]) ensures mass-independent renormalization for the residual theory.

While these equations hold for any f < F, their solutions can be readily formulated in terms of running couplings only when the heavy quarks are decoupled one at a time. Indeed, Witten's running coupling

[formula]

is defined for the case F  =  f + 1 where just one quark h is heavy, with [formula] renormalized mass mh. The definition of [formula] is formulated implicitly [\cite=witten]:

[formula]

It satisfies the constraints

[formula]

where the latter follows from the asymptotic freedom of the F-flavor theory ([formula]). Eqs. ([\ref=b7]), ([\ref=e1]) and ([\ref=f3]) imply that [formula] is renormalization group (RG) invariant:

[formula]

Matching Coupling Constants

Generally, the solutions of Witten's equations depend on renormalized parameters αF and mlF of the original F = f + 1 flavor theory, whereas the limit mh  →    ∞   is to be taken with parameters αf and mlf of the residual theory held fixed. To complete the analysis, it is necessary to derive asymptotic series in ln (mh  /  μ̄) which relate the initial and residual parameters, i.e. to "match" αF and mlF with αf and mlf. As noted in Sec. [\ref=I], Bernreuther and Wetzel [\cite=BW] [\cite=wetzel] [\cite=B1] [\cite=B2] have set up a systematic procedure for this. This section is a brief account of their scheme for the case of coupling-constant matching.

The decoupling formula ([\ref=aa1]) works to any order of perturbation theory, so the task is to express the leading power of the RG-invariant gluon coupling [formula] with and without the heavy-quark h as perturbative series in αF and αf respectively. Generally this involves gluon and other self-energy insertions and a vertex amplitude such as fermion-gluon [\cite=BW] [\cite=wetzel] or ghost-gluon [\cite=B1].

For one-loop contributions [\cite=weinberg2], vertex and propagator corrections cancel (Z1 = Z2), so only the gluon self-energy amplitude

[formula]

is needed. In that case, we can make the replacement

[formula]

in Eq. ([\ref=aa1]), with the result

[formula]

Comparing the original and residual theories, we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

is the contribution of the heavy-quark loop, and [formula] represents other one-loop terms.

The leading power contributed by the heavy-quark loop is

[formula]

with coefficients for leading and non-leading logarithmic orders given by

[formula]

The vanishing of the NLO constant term is a well-known characteristic of the [formula] gluon self-energy [\cite=weinberg2].

Eliminating [formula] from Eq. ([\ref=a4]) and combining the result with Eqs. ([\ref=a3]) and ([\ref=a5]), we recover the standard one-loop matching condition

[formula]

or equivalently

[formula]

The two-loop analysis is much more complicated, so we simply quote the result [\cite=BW] [\cite=wetzel] [\cite=B1] [\cite=B2], taking account of a subsequent correction [\cite=BW] [\cite=larin] [\cite=CKS1]. We find it convenient to consider the inverse form where αf + 1 is written as a series in αf. For the special case of three colors, the result is:

[formula]

The first three terms of the right-hand side belong to the leading order LO, i.e. they are proportional to αf times a power of {αf ln (mh  /  μ̄)}. Only the fourth term is NLO; there is no O(α2f) term independent of mh because the NLO constant in Eq. ([\ref=a5a]) vanishes. The fifth term is O(α3f) and mh-independent, so it is the first example of a NNLO term. The three-loop result, including the NNNLO constant term, is now known [\cite=CKS1].

Now we would like to know what the renormalization group implies for matching relations of this type. Some results for coefficients to a given order of perturbation theory already appear in [\cite=BW] [\cite=wetzel] [\cite=B1]. Consider Eq. (3) of Ref. [\cite=BW],

[formula]

where Ck is a polynomial of degree k, as noted below Eq. (8) of Ref. [\cite=BW]:

[formula]

The constants [formula] are the remainders left when all terms depending on ln (m2h  /  μ2) are subtracted from the leading-power functions  [formula]. Then, if all coefficients and RG functions are known to k - 1 loops, the RG determines all k-loop coefficients ck,j in Ck except for ck,0. The latter cannot be deduced from the RG, to any number of loops; rather, ck,0 must be calculated explicitly via a separate k-loop matching calculation. For example, the NNLO coefficient - 11 / (72π2) in ([\ref=e3c]) is just - c2,0.

Instead of Eq. ([\ref=b1]), we prefer to consider the inverse relation

[formula]

because that is what is required in order to take mh  →    ∞   with αf held fixed. The analogue of Eq. ([\ref=b2]) is

[formula]

An analysis in the style of Bernreuther and Wetzel produces identical conclusions for the remainder constants pk,0: given [formula], one can use the RG to deduce [formula] but not pk,0.

Most practical applications require that terms of the same logarithmic order be summed. This is straightforward for LO logarithms, because the LO coefficients ck,k in ([\ref=b2]) obey a simple relationship [\cite=BW]

[formula]

which makes the series geometric:

[formula]

This expression is leading order (LO) with respect to powers of αf + 1  =  αF and ln (mh  /  μ̄). Eq. ([\ref=a9]) implies that the term O(αf,m- 1h) in ([\ref=a6]) is NLO or higher order:

[formula]

This leads directly to the inverse of ([\ref=a9]),

[formula]

where now LO refers to powers of αf and ln (mh  /  μ̄). Note that the LO coefficients pk,k in Eq. ([\ref=b4]) are given by

[formula]

Beyond LO, formulas for all the relevant coefficients become complicated, making order-by-order summation too cumbersome to be practical. The rest of this paper is concerned with a RG analysis which allows us to consider matching relations to a given logarithmic order without having to expand in perturbative order.

Matching function

Any RG analysis of decoupling involves ar least two renormalization groups: one for the initial F-flavor theory, and one for each f-flavor theory produced as a heavy particle decouples. We append a flavor subscript to make the distinction, viz. RGF or RGf.

A key observation is that any quantity which is RGF invariant must also be RGf invariant (f  <  F). For example, Witten's RGF invariant running coupling [formula] must satisfy the condition

[formula]

Generally, the substitution

[formula]

works when applied to any quantity which survives the limit mh  →    ∞  . An example is the formula

[formula]

which agrees with the general result ([\ref=e1]). However, the converse is not generally true. For example, the top-quark mass mt is RGf = 5 invariant, but it is certainly not RGf = 6 invariant. Therefore a study of the RG for the original F-flavour theory is both necessary and sufficient for the full implications of the RG to be understood.

Our starting point is Witten's definition ([\ref=f3]) of the invariant running coupling [formula]. Let us regard this as a formula for ln (mh  /  μ̄) in terms of [formula] and αF. Specifically, the right-hand side is an integral from αF to [formula] involving RGF functions βF and δF. Can a similar formula be constructed from RGf functions such that this mass logarithm becomes a function of [formula] and αf?

If such a formula exists, it must be consistent with the requirements of the RGF group for the original theory. However, mass renormalization produces an unwelcome F dependence in equations such as

[formula]

So let us amend the proposal: instead of the [formula] mass mh, consider Witten's invariant mass

[formula]

Since h is RGF invariant,

[formula]

replacing mh by h in ([\ref=c1a]) eliminates the unwanted dependence on δF:

[formula]

Notice that the formula ([\ref=c8]) for ln (h  /  μ̄) is an immediate consequence of the definitions ([\ref=f3]) and ([\ref=c5]) of [formula] and h. As a check, DF can be applied to the right-hand side of ([\ref=c8]) to give the result - 1, in agreement with Eq. ([\ref=c5a]).

Now observe that, because of Eq. ([\ref=e1]), the replacement F  →  f everywhere on the right-hand side of ([\ref=c8]) produces a quantity which transforms in the same way under the RGF of the original theory:

[formula]

Comparing Eqs. ([\ref=c5a]) and ([\ref=c5b]), we see that a RGF invariant quantity F can be defined as follows:

[formula]

Since F is dimensionless, it can depend on [formula], but RGF invariance forbids dependence on other dimensionless variables, such as αF, αf, h / mh, or mh  /  μ̄. We call it the matching function:

[formula]

This completes the derivation of the key equations ([\ref=c8]) and ([\ref=c9]):

[formula]

When [formula] is eliminated from these equations, the desired matching relation ([\ref=d0]) is obtained:

[formula]

Perturbation theory for the matching function

Perturbative matching relations can be used to determine successive coefficients in the Taylor series of the matching function [formula]. One needs to calculate the mass-independent terms ck,0 in ([\ref=b2]) or equivalently pk,0 in ([\ref=b4]). As noted in Sec. [\ref=mcc], these constants cannot be deduced from the RG. This corresponds to the fact that FF  →  f cannot be deduced from the RG because it is RGF invariant.

To illustrate the procedure, let us deduce the consequences for Ff + 1  →  f of the perturbative matching relation ([\ref=b1]). We need the two-loop β-function for three colors:

[formula]

Its reciprocal is

[formula]

where bf stands for the constant

[formula]

and bf' is another constant whose precise value is not of concern here.

The expansion ([\ref=d2]) inserted into ([\ref=c8]) and ([\ref=c9]) yields the following equations:

[formula]

Note that the corrections are O(α2f): contributions to ([\ref=d4]) and ([\ref=d5]) from the constant term in ([\ref=d2]) are

[formula]

because [formula], αf + 1 and αf differ by O(α2f).

The next step is to eliminate [formula]. This is partially achieved by subtracting ([\ref=d4]) from ([\ref=d5]):

[formula]

Since [formula] and [formula] are both O(αf), Eqs. ([\ref=a6]) and ([\ref=d6]) imply

[formula]

and so, from Eqs. ([\ref=d4]) and ([\ref=d5]), we conclude

[formula]

The logarithms of these expressions can then be substituted back into Eq. ([\ref=d6]), with the result

[formula]

The next step is to relate the logarithms of h and mh. First substitute the three-color formula

[formula]

into the definition ([\ref=c5]) of h,

[formula]

and then substitute Eq. ([\ref=d9]) for [formula]. The result is:

[formula]

Then the logarithm of h can be eliminated from Eqs. ([\ref=d9a]) and ([\ref=g1a]):

[formula]

Comparing this with the two-loop matching condition ([\ref=e3c]), we see that all mass logarithms are correctly reproduced, and that the first non-zero term in the matching function can be deduced from the constant NNLO term in ([\ref=e3c]):

[formula]

The [formula] term in F can be found by substituting ([\ref=e3d]) back into Eq. ([\ref=c9]) and repeating the above process using the three-loop βf and two-loop δf functions. The answer follows by comparison with the known three-loop matching condition [\cite=CKS1]. That is the limit of current calculations, but in principle, this strategy could be pursued to any order, with all mass logarithms correctly reproduced.

Closed expressions for heavy-quark logarithms

The importance of the matching function F is that it allows us to work to a given logarithmic order without having to sum mass logarithms order-by-order in perturbation theory. Indeed, the role of F is essentially the same as that of the RG functions β, γ and δ: each term in the series for F corresponds to a particular logarithmic order. For LO and NLO, F does not contribute, but NNLO requires that the [formula] term in ([\ref=e3d]) be included, NNNLO requires the [formula] term, and so on.

To illustrate, let us derive the closed NLO formula for the matching relation between αf + 1 and αf which we announced in [\cite=BCST].

As in the previous section, we insert the expansion ([\ref=d2]) into ([\ref=c8]) and ([\ref=c9]), but this time we omit the NNLO term Ff + 1  →  f:

[formula]

The difference of these two equations is

[formula]

The logarithms on the right-hand side are already NLO, so we can use the LO parts of ([\ref=d5b]) and ([\ref=d8]) to approximate their arguments:

[formula]

The result is a NLO generalisation of ([\ref=a8]):

[formula]

If desired, ln (h  /  μ̄) can be eliminated in favor of ln (mh  /  μ̄). The leading NLO effects of mass renormalization are due to the one-loop term of δf given by Eq. ([\ref=g1]). When this term is substituted into the definition ([\ref=c5]) of h, keeping all logarithms to this order, we find an expression

[formula]

to which Eqs. ([\ref=d9b]) and ([\ref=d9c]) can be readily applied:

[formula]

So, by combining ([\ref=e0]) and ([\ref=y1]), we arrive at a complete NLO formula for the matching condition:

[formula]

The same equations can also be used to obtain equations for the RG invariant [formula] (also announced in [\cite=BCST]). Eqs. ([\ref=d3]), ([\ref=d5b]) and ([\ref=d9b]) imply the NLO formula

[formula]

Again, Eq. ([\ref=y1]) can be used to write ln (h  /  μ̄) in terms of ln (mh  /  μ̄). This leads to the following asymptotic formula for [formula] as mh  →    ∞  : These results show that we have complete control over the matching process. Once closed expressions such as ([\ref=y3]) and ([\ref=y2]) have been obtained, RG invariance can be maintained for each logarithmic order, and so there is no need to truncate to a given order of perturbation theory.

Mass-matching function

Most of the analysis above is restricted to the case of just one heavy quark h, but it can be readily extended to include sequential decoupling, where heavy quarks are decoupled one at a time. The new feature which arises is the need to match the mass of the second heavy quark. For example, suppose that, having decoupled the t quark in F = 6 flavor QCD, we would like to decouple the b quark as well:

[formula]

Then it will be necessary to match the six-flavor definition mb6  =  mb of the bottom quark mass to its five-flavour definition mb5.

As for the matching of couplings, the key is to find a RG invariant definition of mass to which the Appelquist-Carrazone theorem [\cite=AC] can be applied. This problem was solved by Bernreuther [\cite=B1], again by recourse to the momentum subtraction (MO) scheme.

Let [formula] and [formula] denote the form factors for the unrenormalized 1PI light-quark self-energy amplitude  [formula]. This corresponds to the unrenormalized quark propagator

[formula]

Define MO light-quark masses [formula] at a fixed space-like point p2  =   - Q2:

[formula]

This mass is RG invariant because, expressed in terms of renormalized quantities, it is finite. The choice of space-like subtraction point - Q2 means that mass renormalization, as well as coupling-constant and wave-function renormalization, is performed off-shell:

[formula]

This avoids problems with Bloch-Nordsieck logarithms produced by n-loop perturbation theory at the on-shell point p2  ~  m2 [\cite=AC]:

[formula]

A complication familiar to many authors [\cite=gauge-dep] is that, unlike an on-shell renormalized mass, [formula]  is gauge dependent. Despite this, the resulting mass-matching relation between [formula] and [formula] is gauge invariant [\cite=B1] because the relations between [formula] masses and their bare counterparts are gauge invariant. In two-loop perturbation theory, the result [\cite=B1] for QCD with three colors and f light flavours is

[formula]

We would like to extend this result to include all terms of the same logarithmic order. This is achieved by introducing our second matching function, G - the matching function for mass renormalization. On order to reduce notational complexity, we consider the special case f = 5 mentioned at the beginning of this section.

Consider the RG equation

[formula]

The leading power in a large-mt expansion of  mb6  /  mb5  is a function of  α5 and  ln (mt  /  μ̄)  but does not depend on light-quark masses, so the general solution of ([\ref=g1d]) is

[formula]

where [formula] is the mass-matching function. Like  [formula]  in Eq. ([\ref=c6]), G6  →  5 arises as an integration constant of a RG equation, so it can depend only on the RG invariant  [formula]. Also like F, it cannot be deduced from the RG and must be calculated separately.

At one-loop order, there are no top-quark corrections (Fig. [\ref=fig1]), so the mass-matching condition is trivial [\cite=B1]:

[formula]

Here αf{} denotes the self-energy amplitude derived from Fig. [\ref=fig1]. Eliminating  [formula], we find

[formula]

At this point, we need to specify what is LO, NLO, and so on. If we were talking only about corrections to mass, we might consider terms  [formula]  as LO, but in general, it is more convenient to regard them as NLO. That is because mass renormalization does not contribute to physical amplitudes in LO. With this convention, Eqs. ([\ref=d2]), ([\ref=d9]), and ([\ref=g1]) imply

[formula]

In lowest-order perturbation theory, we have

[formula]

since the couplings α6 and α5 differ by O(α25). From Eqs. ([\ref=g2]), ([\ref=g4]) and ([\ref=g6]), we conclude

[formula]

Having established that G is irrelevant at NLO, we neglect it in Eq. ([\ref=g2]) and substitute ([\ref=g5]). This yields the complete NLO expression:

[formula]

If desired, α6 can be eliminated in favour of α5 via Eq. ([\ref=a8]). Note that the O(α25) NLO term is a double logarithm which arises from the diagram with a t-loop inserted in the gluon propagator (Fig. [\ref=fig2]):

[formula]

This reproduces the NLO term of Bernreuther's result ([\ref=g0a]) for mf / mf + 1.

Eq. ([\ref=g8]) generates the complete set of NLO logarithms. They correspond to diagrams with a string of one-loop t-quark bubbles inserted in the gluon propagator of the one-loop b-quark self-energy amplitude.

The constant term 89α2f / (432π2) in Eq. ([\ref=g0a]) corresponds to the first non-zero contribution to the matching function G. We state the result for any value of f:

[formula]

This term is required if NNNLO corrections are being calculated.

APPLICATION TO SEQUENTIAL DECOUPLING

When decoupling the b quark, it is natural to define five-flavor quantities 5 and 5 by analogy with the six-flavor running coupling [formula] and mass t for the top quark:

[formula]

Clearly, both 5 and 5 are RGf = 5 invariant,

[formula]

but in fact, they are also RGf = 6 invariant as a consequence of Eqs. ([\ref=e1]) and ([\ref=eq:e2]):

[formula]

This means that 5 and 5 can be expressed in terms of invariants of the original six-flavor theory. To see this, first combine Eqs. ([\ref=h3]) and ([\ref=c5]), and then ([\ref=g2]):

[formula]

This equation simplifies to

[formula]

The sum of Eqs. ([\ref=h3a]) and ([\ref=h3])

[formula]

can be subtracted from Eq. ([\ref=c9]), with the result

[formula]

If ([\ref=i0]) is now combined with ([\ref=h7]), we find that 5 and hence 5 can be expressed in terms of RG invariants of the original six-flavor theory, viz. [formula] and the ratio (mt / mb)6:

[formula]

The sequential decoupling of the t and b quarks refers to the limiting procedure

[formula]

where we choose a six-flavor definition for mb as well as mt. Leading-power six-flavor amplitudes are represented by logarithmic expansions for t-quark decoupling

[formula]

where each five-flavor coefficient [formula] is a leading-power asymptotic expansion for b-quark decoupling:

[formula]

The last decoupling (that of the b quark) is carried out with α4 held fixed. Therefore we seek formulas for couplings such as α6 and [formula] in terms of mt, mb and α4.

As always, the key step in the derivation of NLO formulas is the neglect of some matching functions. In this case, we neglect the NNLO functions [formula] and F5  →  4  =  O(5) for matching α6 to α5 and α5 to α4, and the NNNLO function [formula] for 5 to be matched to 6  =  mb.

We start with the NLO formula ([\ref=g8]) for the five-flavor mass 5. To this order, all dependence on α5 and α6 can be eliminated via LO formulas derived from Eq. ([\ref=a8]),

[formula]

where (again to this order) 5 may be replaced by mb on the right-hand side. Then Eq. ([\ref=g8]) becomes

[formula]

Similarly, consider the NLO relation ([\ref=y3]) between αf + 1 and αf. For the case f = 4, the heavy-quark mass mh in ([\ref=y3]) is 5, but we can use Eq. ([\ref=mb5]) to eliminate 5 in favor of mb,

[formula]

where the constants c4 and d4 are given by

[formula]

For f = 5, mh in ([\ref=y3]) is the six-flavor mass mt. Any α5 dependence can be removed via Eqs. ([\ref=p0]) or ([\ref=p1]):

[formula]

The coefficients c5 and d5 have numerical values

[formula]

The result of combining these formulas is:

[formula]

The same procedure can be applied to the NLO formula ([\ref=y1]) for the RG invariant mass h. For f = 4, the result is

[formula]

after substitution of Eq. ([\ref=mb5]) for 5. For f = 5, Eq. ([\ref=y1]) expresses t in terms of α5, for which the LO formula ([\ref=p0]) may be substituted, with the result

[formula]

If desired, inverses of ([\ref=p4]) and ([\ref=p5]) can be constructed and used to express quantities such as α6 in terms of the invariant masses 5 and t instead of mb and mt.

Finally, we extract NLO formulas for the invariant running couplings for sequential t,b decoupling from Eq. ([\ref=y2]) for [formula]. For the case f = 4, Eqs. ([\ref=y2]) and ([\ref=p4]) imply

[formula]

For f = 5, it is necessary to combine Eq. ([\ref=y2]) with Eqs. ([\ref=mb5]), ([\ref=p1]) and ([\ref=p5]):

[formula]

A useful check of the formalism can be obtained by showing that the difference

[formula]

is correctly given by Eq. ([\ref=i1]) in NLO.

Theories lacking Asymptotic Freedom

So far, we have limited the discussion to heavy fermions in a gauge theory such as QCD and used asymptotic freedom to obtain decoupling in the infinite-mass limit.

Does decoupling work if asymptotic freedom is not present, as in quantum electrodynamics (QED) or scalar field theory with λφ4 interaction in four dimensions? Perhaps this is part of the wider debate [\cite=trivial] about whether such theories are inconsistent or trivial, particularly for the continuum limit of the lattice approximation.

We start from the premise that a theory makes sense only if its heavy particles decouple in the infinite-mass limit to produce another consistent theory. Questions about how the non-perturbative theory could depend on details of regulators and their removal are not considered. We simply assume that some means of producing a fully interacting cutoff-independent theory has been found, e.g. for QEDk with k species of equal-charge leptons, and apply our premise.

The notation is similar to that used above for QCD. Let αk  =  e2k / (4π) be the [formula] renormalized fine structure constant for QEDk, where the charged leptons have [formula] masses [formula], and let βk and δk be the Callan-Symanzik functions for charge and mass renormalization. Denote by [formula] and H Witten's invariant versions of the running fine-structure constant and heavy-lepton mass. Then, repeating the arguments of Secs. [\ref=mf] and [\ref=mmf], we can construct coupling-constant and mass matching functions F and G for the decoupling of one species of lepton:

[formula]

The free-photon theory QED0 lacks a β-function so it is a special case.

First consider the analogue of Eq. ([\ref=c8]), including the case k = 0:

[formula]

The decoupling condition

[formula]

involves the x = 0 solution of the equation βk + 1(x)  =  0, but it produces an infinity of the wrong sign because this fixed point is infra-red stable. For consistency, [formula] must approach a singularity of the integral sufficient to reverse the effect of the x = 0 contribution. This could arise from an ultra-violet fixed point,

[formula]

or else [formula] approaches x =   ∞  , in which case we must suppose that 1 / βk + 1(x) is not integrable.

Next define F as in Eq. ([\ref=c9]), with [formula]:

[formula]

In the decoupling limit ([\ref=q1]), the singularity on the left-hand side is generated entirely from the running of [formula]. We can conclude that this is due to a QEDk fixed point αk,  ∞ only if it coincides with that of QEDk + 1:

[formula]

Similarly, a non-integrable singularity at x =   ∞   can be the sole cause only if this happens for both QEDk and QEDk + 1. Otherwise, we must suppose that the matching function has a singularity at αk,  ∞ or ∞  .

The non-perturbative theory of QED of Johnson, Baker, Willey and Adler [\cite=JBWA] is an example of the case ([\ref=q2]). Indeed, if the arguments of Adler for an infinite-order zero at the fixed point are applied to a many-species theory (all with the same charge), the result is clear: there is no dependence on the number of species.

Notice that these conclusions are driven by the lack of asymptotic freedom of the initial theory. For example, consider what happens in QCD when a heavy quark decouples from the non-asymptotically free 17-flavor theory to produce the 16-flavor theory with asymptotic freedom. Eq. ([\ref=c8]) for F = 17 implies that [formula] increases. Thus in Eq. ([\ref=c9]) with f = 16, [formula] is driven towards a non-perturbative infra-red region of the residual theory.

Concluding Remarks

The introduction of the matching functions F and G for coupling constants and masses (Eqs. ([\ref=c9]) and ([\ref=g2])) completes the theoretical structure needed for a systematic application of the RG to the decoupling of heavy particles. We have considered just QCD and QED, but the field-theoretic principles are much the same for any theory. The main case still to be checked is a full RG analysis of the decoupling of heavy gauge bosons whose masses are induced by the Higgs mechanism.

In this article, we decoupled only one particle at a time (for simplicity) and concentrated on field-theoretic aspects of the subject. Actually, our work on matching functions arises from a need to consider the simultaneous decoupling of more than one heavy quark in phenomenological applications. The challenge is to keep track of dependence on large logarithms such as

[formula]

Since these logarithms do not depend on the [formula] scale μ̄, the conventional tactic used in phenomenology for single heavy quarks fails: there is no way of making such logarithms small by choosing μ̄  =  O(mh).

As indicated in our work [\cite=BCST] on NLO heavy-quark effects in axial charges of nucleons, the analysis can be generalized to include simultaneous decoupling of several heavy particles. This includes the introduction of matching functions of several variables, one for each heavy particle. We will present this extension of the theory in a forthcoming publication.

One can also anticipate generalizations to situations where momentum and mass logarithms grow large together. Examples from the literature occur in collider physics [\cite=denner], Higgs and supersymmetric particle production [\cite=dawson], and deep-inelastic scattering through thresholds for heavy-particle production [\cite=blumlein].
