Quasi-Hodge Metrics and Canonical Singularities

Introduction and Statement

Throughout this paper we work over the base field [formula]. The basic problem in algebraic geometry treated here is the filling-in problem (or degeneration problem). Given a smooth projective family [formula], we would like to know when we can fill in a reasonably nice special fiber [formula] to form a projective family [formula], perhaps up to a finite base change on Δ×. For example, when can [formula] be smooth? When can it be irreducible? Or when can it be irreducible with at most certain type of mild singularities? We would like to search for conditions depending only on the punctured family.

In this paper, for any smooth projective family [formula] over a smooth base S such that [formula] has semi-ample canonical bundle, we shall define for each large [formula] a Kähler metric gm on S, called the m-th quasi-Hodge metric. When S = Δ×, we propose that the incompleteness of gm near 0 for suitable m's provides a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of [formula] to be irreducible and with at most canonical singularities (c.f. Remark 2.5). Notice that the metric incompleteness condition is insensitive to base changes.

More precisely, for a smooth projective family [formula] with [formula], the (possibly degenerate) quasi-Hodge metric gH = g1 on S is given by the semi-positive first Chern form of the rank pg Hodge bundle [formula]. When S  =  Δ×, let T be the monodromy operator acting on [formula] where [formula], s  ≠  0.

For any smooth projective family [formula],

The quasi-Hodge metric gH is incomplete if and only if that [formula] consists of Tr-invariant cycles for some [formula].

In terms of a semi-stable model with [formula], gH is incomplete if and only if that [formula].

In particular, degenerations with Gorenstein canonical singularities have finite gH distance.

This generalizes an earlier result on Calabi-Yau families in [\cite=wang] concerning Weil-Petersson metrics (c.f. ). In the Calabi-Yau case, since pg = 1, there is exactly one component Xi with pg  ≠  0. Starting from this we may deduce

Let [formula] be a degeneration of Calabi-Yau n-folds such that 0∈Δ has finite gH distance. Then the minimal model conjecture (MMC) in dimension n + 1 implies that, up to a finite base change, [formula] is birational to [formula] such that [formula] for s  ≠  0 and [formula] is a Calabi-Yau variety with at most canonical singularities.

This had been solved in the literature for abelian varieties and K3 surfaces (type I degenerations in Kulikov's work [\cite=kulikov]). Indeed in both cases one ends up with smooth families. Here we show that the relative minimal model is the filling-in we seek for. The primary reason is that all other components in [formula] are uni-ruled hence should be contractible. The MMC is known in dimensions up to three by the Mori theory. Recently Shokurov announced the existence of log-flips in dimension four. Its validity would imply the result for degenerations of Calabi-Yau threefolds.

For the general cases when [formula], there could be more than one essential components with pg(Xi)  ≠  0, so gH is insufficient for our purpose. In order to concentrate all the pluri-genera Pm in one component, we need a finer metric on the punctured disk. The actual construction in is to consider the case that [formula] has semi-ample canonical bundle and to take an m-cyclic cover [formula] of [formula] along a smooth divisor [formula] for suitable m's. We then define the m-th quasi-Hodge metrics gm to be gH with respect to [formula]. The semi-ample assumption is to guarantee the invariance of pluri-genera in projective families, which is not needed in Theorem 1.1 by the well-known invariance of Hodge numbers.

Let [formula] be a degeneration of smooth projective manifolds [formula] with semi-ample canonical bundle. If [formula] is irreducible with only canonical singularities then 0∈Δ is at finite gm distance for all m such that gm is defined.

We conjecture that the converse statement holds true. To support some evidence, we verify it in for degenerations of curves.

Let [formula] be a projective family of smooth curves of genus ≥  2, then gm is defined for all [formula] and the incompleteness of gm for any three values of m's implies that up to a finite base change π can be completed into a smooth family.

In we discuss the notion of essential incomplete boundary points. Namely a finite distance degeneration without any smooth filling-in up to any finite base change. Notice that there is no such essential degenerations for curves (Theorem 1.4), abelian varieties and K3 surfaces (as mentioned above).

There exist essential finite gm distance degenerations for threefolds:

Nodal degenerations of Calabi-Yau threefolds with [formula]: these provide the simplest type of examples with nontrivial monodromy.

Terminal degenerations of smooth minimal threefolds: some of them have trivial C∞ monodromy hence provide more subtle examples.

In we make a few remarks on the Weil-Petersson metric on Calabi-Yau moduli spaces and its relation to Viehweg's theory on moduli spaces.

Quasi-Hodge Metrics gH

Let [formula] be a family of polarized algebraic manifolds with [formula]. It is well known that these spaces have constant rank pg (the geometric genus) in s∈S and they form a holomorphic vector bundle [formula]. It is the last piece of the Hodge filtration [formula] with a natural Hermitian metric induced from the topological cup product on each fiber:

[formula]

Griffiths has shown that the first Chern form of (Fn,Q) (for a local frame {ui}):

[formula]

is semi-positive, hence defines a (possibly degenerate) Kähler metric on S. We call it the quasi-Hodge metric. For Calabi-Yau families this agrees with the Weil-Petersson metric defined via the Ricci flat metric on each fiber, but not in other cases (c.f. ).

When [formula] is a degeneration, i.e. π is smooth outside the puncture, we are interested in relating the differential-geometric properties of Δ under the quasi-Hodge metric and the singularities occur in [formula]. Applying Mumford's semi-stable reduction theorem we may and will first assume that [formula] is smooth and [formula] is a simple normal crossing divisor in it. In this case the monodromy T is unipotent. Let N =  log   T be the nilpotent monodromy associated to it. We need Schmid's theory of limiting mixed Hodge structure [\cite=schmid] to analyze this situation.

Fix a reference fiber [formula] with s  ≠  0 and let V to be the primitive cohomology of [formula]. Recall that π induces a variation of Hodge structures (VHS) of weight n on V over Δ× and gives rise to the period map [formula], with D the period domain. The map φ lifts to the upper half plane [formula] with the coordinates s∈Δ× and [formula] related by [formula]. Set

[formula]

([formula] is the compact dual of D.) Since A(z + 1) = A(z), A descends to a function α(s) on Δ×. Schmid's Nilpotent Orbit Theorem implies that α(s) extends holomorphically over s = 0. The special value F∞: = α(0) is called the limiting filtration.

N uniquely determines the monodromy weight filtration on V: [formula] such that N(Wk)  ⊂  Wk - 2 and induces an isomorphism

[formula]

on graded pieces. Fp∞ and Wk together define a polarized mixed Hodge structure (MHS) on V: namely the induced Hodge filtration

[formula]

is a pure Hodge structure of weight k on GWk. N acts on them as a morphism of type ( - 1, - 1) -- N(Fp∞GWk)  ⊂  Fp - 1∞GWk - 2. Moreover, for [formula], the primitive part [formula] is polarized by [formula]. By adding the non-primitive part, the total cohomology [formula] admits non-polarized MHS.

In the rest of this section we prove Theorem 1.1 by dividing it into steps. We start with the following theorem which generalizes the one in [\cite=wang]:

The center 0∈Δ is at finite geodesic distance from the generic point s  ≠  0 under the quasi-Hodge metric if and only if NFn∞ = 0.

Let [formula] be the lifting of the period map. To start the computation, we need to choose a good holomorphic frame Ωj, [formula] of Fn. Let pn:D  →  G(pg,V) be the projection to the Fn part. we have Φn(z) = (ezNα(s))n = ezNαn(s). Here *  n: = pn( * )∈G(pg,V) is the n-th flag. Near t = 0, we can represent αn through local homogeneous coordinates as pg vectors [formula], [formula] in V. Then [formula] is holomorphic in s. We have correspondingly

[formula]

As in [\cite=wang], the function [formula] has the property that all the partial derivatives in x and y decay to 0 exponentially as y  →    ∞  , with rate of decay independent of x. Let h be the class of functions with this property and [formula] the corresponding class of functions with value in V.

Let [formula] for [formula]. This is the desired frame because frame representations correspond to sections of the universal rank pg subbudle of G(pg,V) which pulls back to Fn by Φ. So the Kähler form ω of the induced quasi-Hodge metric on [formula] is given by

[formula]

Since the base is one dimensional, if we write the metric as G|dz|2 then [formula]. From Q(Tu,Tv) = Q(u,v), it follows easily that Q(Nu,v) =  - Q(u,Nv) and Q(ezNu,v) = Q(u,e- zNv). Since [formula], we have

[formula]

where p(y) is a polynomial in y. Let d =  deg   p(y). It has the property that d = 0 if and only if NFn∞  =  0. This is a consequence of the polarization condition for the mixed Hodge structure.

To see this, we may choose the basis [formula] in such a way that for [formula] in the limiting MHS, i < j implies [formula]. Let [formula], that is [formula]. Then the determinant of the q  ×  q matrix corresponds to those entries with index between 1 and q is a positive polynomial in y of degree [formula] by the polarization condition on [formula]. Inductively we may find numbers qk and [formula] with [formula] and [formula] decreases such that the determinant of the corresponding qk  ×  qk matrix (as a block on the diagonal) is a positive polynomial in y of degree [formula]. Now we conclude that the original determinant is a positive polynomial in y of degree [formula] dominant by the product of these diagonal blocks -- because all other elements have smaller degree in y. It is clear that d = 0 if and only if [formula] if and only if NFn∞  =  0.

Then

[formula]

Here we have used the fact that p- 2h∈h. Obviously, if NFn∞ = 0 then d = 0 and G = h, so [formula] for some curve (e.g. x = c). When NFn∞  ≠  0 we have d  ≥  1 and for y large enough we can make h < 1 / y3 uniformly in x, then clearly [formula] for any path with y  →    ∞  .

From the proof, we know that in the case of infinite distance, the quasi-Hodge metric is exponentially asymptotic to a scaling of the Poincaré metric.

So far it is purely Hodge-theoretic and makes perfect sense in the framework of abstract variation of Hodge structures. Now we plug in the geometric data:

For a semi-stable degeneration [formula] of varieties with pg  >  0, if [formula] then the induced quasi-Hodge metric is incomplete at 0 if and only if for s  ≠  0, [formula].

The proof is essentially the same as in [\cite=wang], so we only sketch it briefly.

Deligne has shown that the cohomologies of the normal crossing divisor [formula] admit mixed Hodge structures. Let [formula] be the inclusion map and [formula] the induced map. The Clemens-Schmid exact sequence

[formula]

is an exact sequence of MHS's. The is also known as the Invariant Cycle Theorem which implies that [formula] with [formula] corresponds to T-invariant cycles in Fns. Now the condition NFn∞ = 0 says that all those pg cycles are T-invariant.

Notice that in the statement of Theorem 1.1, part (1), r is the degree of the base change t  ↦  tr performed on Δ in obtaining the semi-stable model.

Let [formula] be a degeneration of smooth projective manifolds [formula], s∈Δ× with geometric genus pg > 0. If [formula] is an irreducible variety with only Gorenstein canonical singularities then 0∈Δ is at finite distance to s  ≠  0 with respect to the quasi-Hodge metric.

By elementary commutative algebra [formula] is Gorenstein implies that [formula] is Gorenstein. Moreover [formula] for all s∈Δ, hence the theorem on semi-continuity implies that [formula].

Now for [formula] a resolution of singularities such that [formula] is a (not necessarily reduced) normal crossing divisor, there exists a component X'0 such that [formula] is a resolution of singularities. By definition of canonical singularities we thus have [formula] for E an effective exceptional divisor. By pulling back canonical sections via φ* we conclude that [formula].

Clearly this inequality holds true for [formula] a semi-stable reduction of [formula]. So by the Invariant Cycle Theorem we must have that [formula]. The above theorem then implies that 0∈Δ is at finite quasi-Hodge distance.

A normal [formula]-Gorenstein variety X is said to have (at most) canonical singularities if for a (hence for any) resolution of singularities φ:Y  →  X, [formula] with ei  ≥  0, where the sum is over all exceptional divisors. In dimension two, canonical singularities are precisely [formula] for a finite sub-group [formula], the so called ADE singularities. In dimension three there is a classification theory due to Reid and Mori [\cite=reid]. The generic hyperplane section of a canonical singularities is again canonical, so the generic surface slices of canonical singularities are ADE singularities.

The m-th Quasi-Hodge Metrics gm

Following Viehweg [\cite=viehweg], we will assume that [formula] has semi-ample canonical bundle for the smooth family [formula]. This implies that [formula] is a locally free sheaf for each [formula] (see Theorem 8.16 in [\cite=viehweg], for this one needs only that [formula] has Gorenstein canonical singularities). Unlike the case m = 1, we do not have an immediate natural hermitian metric on the underlying vector bundle. Let [formula] be sufficiently large so that there exists a divisor [formula] smooth over S. By taking an m-cyclic cover along [formula] (c.f. [\cite=viehweg] Lemma 2.3), we get a family

[formula]

with eigenspace decomposition [formula] and Riφ* = 0 for i > 0 (since φ is finite). Also from the generalized Hurwitz formula [formula] with [formula], we see that [formula]. Simple spectral sequence argument and projection formula then show that

[formula]

The m-th quasi-Hodge metric gm on S is defined to be the quasi-Hodge metric attached to [formula] as defined in .

Let S = Δ×. By Theorem 2.1 (or 2.3), the Kähler metric gm is incomplete at 0 if and only if all [formula] (s  ≠  0) are Tr-invariant. In view of the above splitting, this should indicate certain extension properties of pluri-canonical forms in [formula] (s  ≠  0) to the central fiber. Here is our proposal:

Take a semi-stable model [formula] with [formula]. The incompleteness of gm should be equivalent to certain twisted pluri-genera equalities [formula] for 1  ≤  k  ≤  m (c.f. Lemma 4.1).

The twisted pluri-genera equalities for all [formula] should force that there is only one component, say X0, to have non-zero pluri-genera. Mori theory implies that all the other components are uni-ruled. It should be enough to verify the equality up to a sufficiently large m which depends only on [formula].

Finally we expect to contract all Xi with i  ≠  0 using Mori's extremal contractions. If we apply directly the MMC, we should then arrive at a model [formula] such that [formula] has only canonical singularities.

To make sense of this, we first show that the incompleteness of gm is a necessary condition for degenerations with canonical singularities.

(of Proposition 1.3.) The only key point is that the m-th cyclic covering construction along D∈|KmX| can be carried over to families [formula] when [formula] has canonical singularities of index dividing m, and the resulting covering families [formula] has the property that [formula] has only Gorenstein canonical singularities. Hence by Theorem 1.1 (or rather Corollary 2.4) that gm is incomplete.

Indeed one has the constancy of Pm in s∈Δ for canonical degenerations (with semi-ample K) and hence the Pm equalities for any semi-stable model. It is thus natural to conjecture that the Pm equalities for a finite number of m's are equivalent to the existence of canonical degenerations. Notice that the Pk equality for all k  ≤  m is a stronger assumption than the incompleteness of gm.

It is long conjectured that for smooth projective families [formula] the pluri-genera is locally constant in s∈S. Recently Siu [\cite=siu] proved this for smooth varieties of general type. This has then been extended to families with canonical singularities [\cite=kawamata1]. We have chosen to work on families with semi-ample K to avoid the technicality involved in Siu's theorem.

In the following two sections, we justify our proposal by verifying it for curves and by showing that MMC implies the case of Calabi-Yau manifolds.

The Case of Curves

We will consider curves of genus ≥  2. The case of elliptic curves is easier, which is also a special case of Calabi-Yau manifolds to be discussed later.

The natural algebro-geometric way to treat this problem is to start with a semistable degeneration [formula] with [formula] and then try to simplify it through birational modifications. Since the total space [formula] is a surface, the modifications needed are simply contraction of ( - 1) curves. So we may assume that [formula] is relative minimal and semi-stable and [formula]. Let gi  =  g(Xi) and [formula]. The famous stable reduction theorem for curves states that we may further contract ( - 2) curves so that every component Xi is stable in the sense that if gi = 0 then di  ≥  3 (and if gi = 1 then di  ≥  1, which is always true here since [formula] is connected). The only subtle point is that [formula] may have An type singularities. Since this will not affect our later discussion, for the sake of simplicity we will assume we are already in a stable reduction.

For [formula] such that [formula] is S-very ample, let [formula] be a smooth member which does not contain any special point in any [formula] and the singular points of [formula]. We also assume that S is small enough so that [formula] and [formula]. By Theorem 1.1, the quasi-Hodge metric gm constructed from the m-th cyclic cover [formula] along [formula] is incomplete if and only if [formula]. This is because [formula] is a stable degeneration by construction and the presence of An singularities does not affect the result -- further blowing-ups gives ( - 2) curves which have no contribution to the geometric genus. By the generalized Hurwitz formula, we have seen in that [formula]. Moreover, we have

[formula] where kXi is the twisted (or logarithmic) pluri-canonical sheaf defined as [formula].

Let [formula] be the new families with [formula]. By the construction, φi:Yi  →  Xi is an m-cyclic cover along

[formula]

Then we have eigenspace decomposition [formula]. The same proof as in gives [formula].

(of Theorem 1.4.) We will show that if gm is incomplete for three m's then in a stable reduction there is only one component X0 in [formula], which is then smooth of genus [formula].

From the Riemann-Roch formula,

[formula]

It is clear that h1(kXi) = 0 for k  ≥  2 by the stability condition. Also [formula]. So the equality

[formula]

becomes

[formula]

which is

[formula]

If this is true for any three values of m's then we get |I| = 1, say I = {0} and [formula] as desired.

The Case of Calabi-Yau Manifolds

We start with the following corollary of Theorem 1.1.

Let [formula] be a semi-stable degeneration of Calabi-Yau manifolds. Then gH is incomplete at 0∈Δ if and only if there is an irreducible component [formula] such that hn,0  ≠  0. This is equivalent to that there is exact one component with hn,0 = 1.

For any relative minimal model [formula] of a degeneration of Calabi-Yau manifolds [formula], if [formula] has more than one component then each Xi has - KXi,red a nontrivial effective divisor on Xi,red.

For divisors we use the notation "~  " to denote [formula]-linear equivalence. Since [formula] is a holomorphic function, we have that [formula] for any s∈Δ. Also if [formula] is a divisor such that π(D) is not a point, then [formula] will be a nontrivial divisor of [formula].

Since [formula] is birational to [formula], it is a terminal Calabi-Yau variety for s  ≠  0, that is [formula]. By adjunction formula on such [formula], we conclude that [formula] is supported on the central fiber and so is of the form [formula] with [formula].

Since [formula], we may adjust ai so that max   ai  =  0. Let I = {i  |  ai  =  0}. For i∈I and a curve [formula] one has

[formula]

If [formula], we may choose [formula] such that [formula] and aj  <  0 by the connectedness of [formula]. But then [formula], contradicts to the nefness of [formula].

So we must have ai  =  0 for all i. That is, [formula]. Now take any component Xi, one has

[formula]

which by the connectedness again is a nontrivial negative effective divisor if there are more than one components. The case for Xi,red is entirely similar.

(of Proposition 1.2.) We first take a semi-stable reduction [formula] of our original degenerations. This may require a finite base change on the base, but this will not change the finite distance condition on the metric. We want to conclude that any relative minimal model (if there exists any) of it, denoted by [formula] has only one component in the central fiber. Let [formula] with X'0 the unique component with a canonical section Ω∈Γ(X'0,KX'0).

By the conjectural construction of relative minimal models, one uses only divisorial contractions and flips of relative extremal rays, hence only the central fiber will be modified since the general fibers are already smooth Calabi-Yau. Notice that during the process the proper transform of X'0 is never contracted. Indeed, if a component W in the central fiber is contracted in some step, then W is covered by (extremal) rational curves [\cite=kawamata2]. This will continue to hold true for any smooth model Y of W hence κ(Y) =  -   ∞   and so Y can not be X'0.

By Lemma 5.2, if there are more than one components in [formula] then any component Xi has KXi =  - D  ≠  0. If Xi is not normal, passing to normalization ψ:W  →  Xi with conductor C  ⊂  W can only make KW  =  ψ*KXi - C more non-effective. Hence passing to any smooth model [formula] with φ':Y  →  W, KY  =  φ'*KW  +  E shows that KY =  - φ*D  -  φ'*C  +  E. This is never an effective divisor because E is φ'-exceptional. By the birational invariance of pg among smooth models, this contradicts to the existence of Ω on X'0. Hence [formula] has only one component and [formula].

To see that [formula] has at most canonical singularities, let φ:Y  →  X be a resolution of singularities. Clearly [formula] since X has a smooth model with pg = 1. In particular, KY is effective. Also [formula] since KX = 0. If X is normal, since it is Gorenstein we have KY  =  φ*KX  +  E  =  E which shows that E is effective and so X has at most canonical singularities. If X is not normal, let ψ:W  →  X be the normalization with non-zero conductor divisor C  ⊂  W and let φ factors through ψ as [formula] with φ':Y  →  W. Then KW  =  ψ*KX  -  C  =   - C and KY  =  φ'*KW  +  E' =  - φ'*C + E', which is never effective, a contradiction. Hence X is normal and is in fact a Calabi-Yau variety with at most canonical singularities. The proof is thus completed.

Essential Incomplete Boundary Points

A degeneration over the unit disk is called non-essential if it admits a finite base change so that the punctured family can be completed into a smooth family. Otherwise it is called essential. Clearly a necessary condition of a degeneration to be non-essential is that the monodromy is of finite order, or N = 0. In particular it is of finite distance. In fact for K3 surfaces any finite distance degeneration is non-essential [\cite=kulikov]. It is thus interesting to see whether there exists essential finite distance degenerations in higher dimensions.

The classical Picard-Lefschetz theory states that for a Lefschetz pencil (i.e. nodal degenerations) each node, or ODP, pi will correspond to a vanishing cycle [formula] and all these σi's generate the space of vanishing cycles V which is the kernel of the map [formula]. Moreover the monodromy N  ≠  0 if and only if V  ≠  0. However, there is no general local criterion to test whether σi  ≠  0 for a given ODP pi. The σi is always trivial for n even and must be trivial even for n odd if [formula] -- for example, nodal degenerations for cubic or quartic threefolds.

Here we show that V  ≠  0 for any nodal degenerations of Calabi-Yau 3-folds.

(of Theorem 1.5, part (1)) First of all, a nodal threefold [formula] always admits (not necessarily projective) small resolutions [formula] with smooth rational curves [formula] contracted to ODP's. In the case of Calabi-Yau threefolds (Gorenstein threefolds with trivial canonical bundle) with [formula], the existence of global smoothing [formula] of [formula] forces that there are nontrivial relations of ∈H2(X) by Friedman's result [\cite=freidman1], [\cite=freidman2]. That is, the canonical map [formula] has nontrivial kernel dimension ρ > 0. Consider the resulting surgery diagram:

[formula]

It has the following local description: let Vi∋pi be a contractible neighborhood of an ODP, [formula] be the smoothing of Vi and Ui  ⊂  X be the inverse image of Vi. Then

Ui is a deformation retract neighborhood of Ci and so has the homotopy type of S2  ~  D4  ×  S2.

V'i has the homotopy type of S3  ×  D3. Where the sections σi  ~  S3 are the vanishing cycles.

The surgery from X to [formula] is induced from ∂(D4  ×  S2) = S3  ×  S2  =  ∂(S3  ×  D3).

Let us assume that there are k ODP's. An immediate consequence is the Euler number formula:

[formula]

Let W be the "common open set" of X, [formula] and [formula] away from all points pi's such that W and Vi's cover [formula] etc. A portion of the Mayer-Vietoris sequence of the covering {W,  V'i} of [formula] gives

[formula]

Hence that [formula].

Take into account of [formula] and [formula] (which also follows from suitable Mayer-Vietoris sequences), simple manipulations show that [formula]. Comparing with the (Mayer-Vietoris) sequence defining the vanishing cycles:

[formula]

we conclude that ρ, which is non-zero, is the dimension of V.

It is possible for an essential degeneration to have trivial monodromy. In [\cite=freidman2], Friedman remarked that Clemens has constructed families of quintic hypersurfaces in [formula] acquiring an A2 singularity and have monodromy of finite order. He then asked whether this family can be filled in smoothly up to a base change. This has been answered negatively in [\cite=wang]. We recall the statement here for the reader's convenience.

Let [formula] be a projective smoothing of a nontrivial Gorenstein terminal minimal threefold [formula] over the unit disk. Then, up to any finite base change, [formula] is not Δ-birational to a projective smooth family [formula] of minimal threefolds.

In view of Proposition 1.3, this implies that terminal degenerations of smooth minimal threefolds provide essential incomplete boundary points of the moduli spaces with respect to the quasi-Hodge metrics gm for all m. This proves Theorem 1.5, part (2).

Remarks on Moduli and Weil-Petersson Metrics

Canonical singularity naturally occurs in minimal and canonical models in algebraic geometry. It also plays a significant role in string theory through the connection with Calabi-Yau manifolds. On the other hand, in various situations it behaves just like smooth points. A nice example is Viehweg's program on constructing quasi-projective moduli spaces of polarized manifolds [\cite=viehweg]. He showed that it is essentially the same proof to include varieties with canonical singularities as long as the deformation invariance can be verified. This was recently proved by Kawamata [\cite=kawamata1] based on [\cite=siu].

Along different lines, the author had attempted to understand the boundary of moduli spaces of Calabi-Yau manifolds from the differential geometric point of view [\cite=wang]. It was found that the natural Weil-Petersson metric on the moduli space is incomplete, therefore the metric completion of moduli spaces becomes an important problem. It was proved that degenerations of Calabi-Yau manifolds with at most canonical singularities are at finite Weil-Petersson distance. It was also conjectured there that the converse holds. Its truth would imply that Viehweg's enlarged moduli spaces coincide with the metric completion of the moduli spaces, hence a perfect match between viewpoints in algebraic geometry and differential geometry. Now this follows from the minimal model conjectures by Proposition 1.2.

The Weil-Petersson metric on the moduli space of Calabi-Yau manifolds is defined as the variation of the underlying Ricci flat metrics. For a given polarized Calabi-Yau family [formula] with Ricci flat metrics g(s) on [formula], under the Kodaira-Spencer map [formula] (harmonic forms with respect to g(s)), we have for v, w∈Ts(S),

[formula]

It is a quite surprising fact that gWP admits a Hodge theoretic description. Indeed gWP = gH. This follows from the fact that the holomorphic volume form Ω(s) is parallel with respect to g(s), which again is equivalent to the Ricci flat condition

[formula]

for a constant f(s) depending only on s∈S. Indeed f(s) is the point-wise length square of Ω(s) if we normalize the volume to be 1. This viewpoint provides an alternative differential geometric way to look at the above canonical singularity conjecture without using the minimal model theory.

With the Ω chosen as in , the incompleteness of gH = gWP of a punctured Calabi-Yau family [formula] is equivalent to the continuity of f(s) over 0∈Δ. We attempt to show from this the uniform boundedness of diameter of [formula] for all s∈Δ×. With this done, we may then proceed by using the theory of Hausdorff convergence. The details of this differential geometric approach will appear in a separate work.
