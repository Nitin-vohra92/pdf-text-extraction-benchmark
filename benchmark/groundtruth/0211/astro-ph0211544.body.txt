Introduction

The cosmic concordance of data from three disparate sources: Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Large Scale Structure (LSS) and High-Red-Shift Supernovae (SNeIA) suggests that the present values of the dark energy and matter components, in terms of the critical density, are approximately ΩX≃0.7 and ΩM≃0.3. The question to which we try to make a small contribution in this paper is to what extent precision cosmological data will allow us to discriminate between possible futute fates of the Universe?

If one makes the most conservative assumption that ΩX corresponds to a cosmological constant with Equation of State given by a constant w  =  p / ρ  =   - 1, then the future evolution of the universe follows from the Friedmann equation

[formula]

in which a(t) is the scale factor normalized at the present time as a(t0) = 1, ρ(t) = ρ(0)a- 3 is the energy density of matter component and Λ is constant. Here we assumed that the universe is flat and neglected radiation.

In such a simple, and still viable, case the behavior of a(t) for asymptotically large t  →    ∞   is

[formula]

so that the dark energy asymptotically dominates and the universe is blown apart in an infinite time a(t)  →    ∞   as t  →    ∞  .

Even assuming that w is constant, however, there is a wide range of possible w: according to [\cite=HM] the allowed values are - 2.68  <  w  <   - 0.78. We do not assume this result but will arrive at a similar allowed range; the difference is because our priors are slightly different (we fix the cosmological parameters ΩM  =  0.3,ΩΛ  =  0.7,Ωb  =  0.02, and h  =  0.65 instead of allowing them to vary.) The asymptotic behavior in Eq.([\ref=desitter]) is very far from established by present data. The case w  <   - 1 has the property that boosting from the dark energy rest frame to an inertial frame with velocity satisfying (v / c)2  >   - 1 / w leads to a negative energy density, but this does not violate any law of physics. Here we shall consider some simple models for w, including dependence on red-shift w(z), to illustrate how far existing data are from answering the question of the future fate of the universe. As we will show, for a model in which w varies linearly with red-shift, present data are consistent with extremely different futures. For examples, in one case the scale factor diverges[\cite=caldwell] [\cite=starobinsky] in finite time , in just another 7 Gyr, while in another case the energy density of dark energy decreases eventually faster than that of matter, i.e., the dark energy disappears and the universe reverts to being matter-dominated with a(t)  ~  t2 / 3, as t  →    ∞  .

Constant Equation of State.

Here we discuss the future fate of the universe in the case of the constant equation of state. If we assume, to begin, that w is constant then, keeping only the dark energy term

[formula]

where β  =  3(1 + w). Most authors have discussed the case with w  ≥   - 1, however the case with w  <   - 1 is also possible and discussed phenomenologically in [\cite=HM] [\cite=caldwell] [\cite=schulz], and in connection with string theory in [\cite=PHF]. If β  <  0, corresponding to w  <   - 1, the solution of Eq.([\ref=constantw]) diverges at a finite time t  =  t*. By integrating

[formula]

one finds that the remaining time tr before time ends tr  =  (t*  -  t0) is given analytically by

[formula]

In Eq.([\ref=tr]), putting in ΩX  =  0.7 and [formula] Gyr one finds for w  =   - 1.5, - 2.0 and - 2.5, respectively tr  =  22, 11 and 7.3 Gyr.

In such a constant w scenario which is consistent with all cosmological data, the divergence of the scale factor will occur in a finite time period of 7 Gyr (or more) from now.

With respect to the Solar System, this end of time occurs generally after the Sun has transformed into a Red Giant, and swallowed the Earth, as is expected approximately 5 Gyr in the future.

Equation of State Varying Linearly with Red-Shift.

As a more general ansatz, we consider the model for w depending linearly on red-shift:

[formula]

where the modification is cut off arbitrarily at some Z = ζ  >  0. We assume C  ≤  0 and consider the two-dimensional parameter space spanned by the two variables w(0) and C.

In order to discuss constraints on our phenomenological model, we compare its prediction with experimental data from SNeIA and CMB. We evaluate the goodness-of-fit parameter χ2 as a function of w(0) and C. For SNe1A, we used a dataset consisting of 37 SNe from [\cite=SN_Riess] with the MLCS method. To calculate the CMB power spectrum, we used a modified version of CMBFAST [\cite=CMBFAST]. For the analysis of CMB, we used experimental data from COBE [\cite=COBE], BOOMERanG [\cite=BOOMERANG], MAXIMA [\cite=MAXIMA] and DASI [\cite=DASI]. To calculate χ2, we adopt the offset log-normal approximation [\cite=BJN] and used RADPACK package [\cite=RADPACK]. We also studied the constraint from LSS using the 2dF data [\cite=LSS], and found that it does not give severe constraint on the parameters w(0) and C.

For an illustration, we take the cosmological parameters as Ωbh2 = 0.02,ΩM = 0.3,ΩX = 0.7 and h = 0.65, and the initial power spectra are assumed to be scale invariant in all numerical calculation in this paper.

To set the stage, let us first use only the SNe1A data to constrain the parameters w(0) and C. The result is shown for ζ  =  2 in Figure 1 where the 99 % C. L. allowed region is the region between the two dashed lines shown. We may remark three distinct regions:

(I) w(0)  <  (C  -  1). In this case there is divergence of the scale factor, at a finite future time.

(II) (C  -  1)  ≤  w(0)  <  C. Here the lifetime of the universe is infinite. The dark energy dominates over matter, as now, at all future times.

(III) C  ≤  w(0). The lifetime of the universe is again infinite but after a finite time the dark energy will disappear relative to the dark matter and matter-domination will be re-established with a(t)  ~  t2 / 3.

When we add the constraints imposed by the CMB data, the allowed region is smaller as shown in Figure 2, plotted for ζ  =  0.5. Such a small ζ still allows all three future possibilities (I), (II) and (III). For somewhat larger ζ only possibilities (I) and (II) are allowed in this particular parameterization.

The case ζ  =  2 is exhibited in more detail for different values of w(0) and C in Figures 3 and 4. Figure 3 shows the variation of the transition red-shift Ztr where deceleration changes to accelerated cosmic expansion defined by q(Ztr)  =  0. From the figure, we can read off that Ztr becomes smaller as C becomes more negative for fixed w(0); this is because the epoch where dark energy becomes the dominant component of the Universe becomes later. This affects the magnitude-red shift relation of high-Z supernovae. In Figure 4, the magnitude-red shift relation is shown for the SNeIA data [\cite=SN_Riess] along with the prediction of our phenomenological model for ζ  =  2. The magnitudes are calculated, as usual, relative to the empty universe Milne model with ΩM = 0, ~  ~ ΩX  =  0 and Ωk  =  1. One can expect that high-redshift SNe would appear dimmer if C were more negative.

To return to our main point, let us assume that more precise cosmological data will allow an approximate determination of w(Z)  =  f(Z) as a function of Z for positive Z  >  0. Then to illustrate the possible future evolutions write:

[formula]

In this case, the future scenarios (I), (II) and (III) occur respectively for α  >  (f(0) + 1), (f(0)  +  1)  >  α  >  f(0) and α  <  f(0).

Present data are consistent with a simple cosmological constant f(Z)  =   - 1 in Eq.([\ref=EoS2]) in which case the divergence of the scale factor occurs for α  >  0, the infinite-time dark energy domination for 0  >  α  >   - 1, and disappearing dark energy for α  <   - 1.

Since in practice F(Z) for Z  ≥  0 will never be determined with perfect accuracy the continuation of w(Z) to future Z  <  0 will be undecidable from observation as will therefore be the ultimate fate of the Universe.
