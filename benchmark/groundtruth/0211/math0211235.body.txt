Bergman Kernels and Local Holomorphic Morse Inequalities.

Introduction

Let X be an n - dimensional (possibly non-compact) complex manifold equipped with a hermitian metric two-form, denoted by ω. Furthermore, let L be a holomorphic line bundle over X. The hermitian fiber metric on L will be denoted by φ. In practice, φ is considered as a collection of local functions. Namely, let s be a local holomorphic trivializing section of L, then locally, [formula] and the canonical curvature two-form of L can be expressed as [formula] When X is compact Demailly's holomorphic Morse inequalities [\cite=d1] give asymptotic bounds on the dimension of the Dolbeault cohomology groups associated to Lk:

[formula]

where X(q) is the subset of X where the curvature-two form [formula] has exactly q negative eigenvalues and n - q positive ones. These are the weak holomorphic Morse inequalities - they also have strong counterparts involving alternating sums of the dimensions. Demailly's inspiration came from Witten's analytical proof of the classical Morse inequalities for the Betti numbers of a real manifold [\cite=wi], where the role of the fiber metric φ is played by a Morse function. Subsequently, proofs based on asymptotic estimates of the heat kernel of the [formula] Laplacian, were given by Demailly, Bouche and Bismut ([\cite=d2], [\cite=bo] and [\cite=bi]). All of these proofs use quite delicate analytical arguments - heat kernel estimates and global estimates deduced from the Bochner-Kodaira-Nakano identity for non-K�hler manifolds. In the present paper it is shown that Demaillys inequalities, may be obtained from comparatively elementary considerations. The starting point is the formula

[formula]

where [formula] is any orthonormal base for the space of [formula]harmonic (0,q) - forms with values in Lk), when X is compact (this is obvious for the dimension of the harmonic space - and by the Hodge theorem the dimensions coincide). It is shown that the integrand, called the Bergman kernel function Bq,kX(x), may be asymptotically estimated by a model kernel in [formula] Integration then yields Demailly's weak inequalities and a similar argument gives the strong inequalities. The main point of the proof is to first show the corresponding localization property for the closely related extremal function Sq,kX(x) defined as

[formula]

where the supremum is taken over all [formula]harmonic (0,q) - forms with values in Lk. Since the estimates are purely local, they hold on any (possibly non-compact) complex manifold, and yield local weak holomorphic Morse inequalities for the corresponding L2  -  objects. The main inspiration for the present paper comes from Berntsson's recent article [\cite=be].

One final remark: it is fair to say that the formula [\ref=dim_B_H_as_bergman_kernel_intro] is the starting point for the previous writers approaches to Demailly's inequalities, as well. The heat kernel approach is based on the observation that the term corresponding to the zero eigen value in the heat kernel on the diagonal eq,k(x,x;t) is precisely the Bergman kernel function Bq,kX(x) (if X is compact). Moreover, when t tends to infinity the contribution of the the other eigen values tends to zero. The main problem, then, is to obtain the asymptotic expression for the heat kernel in k and t and investigate the interchanging or the limits in k and t. The point of the present paper is to work directly with the Bergman kernel.

Statement of the main result

Recall that the [formula]Laplacian is defined by [formula] (where [formula] denotes the formal adjoint of [formula] and its L2  -  kernel is the space of harmonic (0,q)-forms with values in Lk, denoted by H0,q(X,Lk). By the well-known Hodge theorem this space is isomorphic to the Dolbeault cohomology group [formula], when X is compact. Now define the Bergman kernel function Bq,kX(x) and the extremal function Sq,kX(x) of Hq(X,Lk) by

[formula]

where [formula] is any orthonormal base in Hq(X,Lk) and the supremum is taken over all forms in Hq(X,Lk). To define the corresponding "model" functions at a point x in X, [formula] and [formula] proceed as before, replacing the manifold X with [formula] the base metric in X with the Euclidean metric in [formula] and the fiber metric φ on L with the fiber metric φ0 on the trivial line bundle over [formula] where

[formula]

and where the curvature two-form [formula] in [formula] is obtained by "freezing" the curvature two-form [formula] on X, at the point x (with respect to on orthonormal frame at x). Finally, denote by X(q) the subset of X where the curvature-two form [formula] has exactly q negative eigenvalues and n - q positive ones. Its characteristic function is denoted by 1X(q). Moreover, let [formula]

The first theorem we shall prove is a local version of Demailly's weak holomorphic Morse inequalities. Note that the manifold X is not assumed to be compact, neither is there any assumption, e.g. completeness, on the hermitian metric ω.

Let (X,ω) be a hermitian manifold. Then

[formula]

and

[formula]

Moreover,

[formula]

if one of the limits exists.

This seems to be a new result. The inequality for Sq,kX(x) generalizes results of Bouche [\cite=bo] and Gillet, Soul�, Gromov [\cite=gi], that are non-local and concern compact manifolds X. Integration of the inequality for the Bergman kernel gives Demailly's weak inequalities [\ref=demailly_weak_ineaq].

When X is compact the local Morse inequalities can be extended to an asymptotic equality as follows. Let Bq,k≤  νk be the Bergman kernel function of the space spanned by all the eigenforms of the [formula]Laplacian, whose eigenvalues are bounded by νk.

Let (X,ω) be a compact hermitian manifold. Then

[formula]

for some sequence μk tending to zero.

Again, integrating this yields, with the help of a well-known homological algebra argument Demailly's strong holomorphic Morse inequalities. When the curvature of the line bundle L is strictly positive the asymptotic equality holds for the usual Bergman kernel for the space of holomorphic sections of Lk. This was first proved by Tian [\cite=ti]) with a certain control on the lower order terms in k. A complete asymptotic expansion was given in [\cite=z] using microlocal analysis. See also [\cite=lin] where the manifold is [formula] and [\cite=bor] where the complex structure is non-integrable.

The two theorems have straight forward generalizations to the case where the forms take values in [formula] for a given rank r hermitian holomorphic vector bundle E over X. The estimate for the extremal function Sq,kX is unaltered, while the results for the Bergman kernel function Bq,kX are modified by a factor r in the right hand side.

The notation [formula] will stand for a = (  ≤  )Ckb, where Ck tends to one with k.

A sketch of the proof of the local weak holomorphic Morse inequalities

First we we will show how to obtain the estimate

[formula]

By definition, there is a unit norm sequence αk of harmonic forms with values in Lk such that

[formula]

Now consider the restriction of the the form αk(x) to a ball BRk with center in the point x and with radius Rk decreasing to zero with k. The main point of the proof is that the form αk is asymptotically harmonic, with respect to a model fiber metric, on a ball of radius slightly larger than [formula] and is then a candidate for the corresponding model extremal function. Indeed, we can arrange that the fiber metric kφ on the line bundle Lk can be written as

[formula]

in local coordinates around x. The form [formula] defined on the scaled ball [formula] where α(k)(z) denotes the (component wise) scaled form [formula] satisfies

[formula]

Moreover, β(k) is harmonic with respect to the scaled Laplacian [formula], taken with respect to the scaled fiber metric (kφ)(k)on Lk:

[formula]

The point is that the scaled fiber metric converges to the quadratic model fiber metric φ0 in [formula] whith an appropriate choice of the radii Rk. As a consequence the operator [formula] converges to the model Laplacian [formula] Standard techniques for elliptic operators then yields a subsequence of forms β(kj) converging to a form β defined in all of [formula] which is harmonic with respect to the model Laplacian. This means that

[formula]

proving [\ref=weak_inequality_scetch]. Finally, lemma [\ref=lemma:_comparing_B_and_S_in_general], relating Sq,k(x) and the Bergman kernel function Bq,k(x), is used to deduce the corresponding estimate for the Bergman kernel function. All that remains is to compute the Bergman kernel and the extremal function in the model case (section [\ref=section:model]).

The Bergman kernel function [formula] and the extremal function [formula].

In section [\ref=subsection_statement_of_main_result] the Bergman kernel function Bq,kX and the extremal function Sq,kX were defined. We will also have use for component versions of Sq,kX. For a given orthonormal frame eIx in [formula] let

[formula]

where αI(x) denotes the component of α along eIx. It will be clear from the context what frame is being used. These functions are closely related according to the following, simple, yet very useful lemma. Its statement generalizes a lemma used in [\cite=be] (see also [\cite=li]).

Let L be a hermitian holomorphic line bundle over X. With notation as above

[formula]

To prove the first inequality in the statement, take any α in H0,q(X,Lk) of unit norm. Since α is contained in an orthonormal base, obviously [formula] which proves the first inequality. For the second inequality, let [formula] be an orthonormal base for H0,q(X,Lk), so that [formula] Fix a J and let [formula] Then, summing only over i, gives

[formula]

where [formula] lies in Hq(X,Lk) and is of unit norm. Thus,

[formula]

Finally, squaring the last relation and summing over J proves the second inequality.

The Weak Holomorphic Morse Inequalities

In this section we prove the local version of Demailly's holomorphic Morse inequalities over any complex manifold X. The usual version is obtained as a corollary. Around each point x in X, fix local complex coordinates [formula] and a holomorphic trivializing section s of L such that

[formula]

and

[formula]

where the quadratic part of φ is denoted by φ0. Note that in the local coordinates the base metric ω coincides with the Euclidean metric at the origin. Moreover, we have the identities,

[formula]

The following notation will be useful. Let [formula] in [formula] and let [formula] Using the local chart around x, a (small) ball BR is identified with a subset of X. Given a function f on the ball BRk, we define a scaled function on [formula] by

[formula]

Forms are scaled by scaling the components. Observe that scaling the fiber metric on Lk gives

[formula]

which motivates the choice of scaling. The radius [formula] has been chosen to make sure that the fiber metric on Lk tends to the quadratic model fiber metric φ0 with all derivatives on scaled balls, i.e.

[formula]

where the convergence is of the order [formula] to some power, which follows immediately from the expansion [\ref=fiber_metric_expansion]. Moreover, [formula] tends to infinity, so that the sequence of scaled balls [formula] exhausts [formula] Let us denote by [formula] the Laplacian, taken with respect to the scaled fiber metric (kφ)(k) and the scaled base metric ω(k). One can check that

[formula]

Hence, if αk is a form with values in Lk, which is harmonic with respect to the global Laplacian, i.e [formula] then the scaled form α(k) satifies

[formula]

on the scaled ball [formula] Moreover, because of the convergence property [\ref=convergence_of_fiber_m_(new)] it is not hard to check that

[formula]

where Dk is a second order partial differential operator with bounded variable coeffiecients on the scaled ball [formula] and εk is a sequence tending to zero with k (in fact, all the derivatives of the coefficients of Dk are uniformly bounded). It also follows from [\ref=convergence_of_fiber_m_(new)] that for any form αk with values in Lk,

[formula]

where the factor k- n comes from the change of variables [formula] in the integral.

The proof of the following lemma is based on standard techniques for elliptic operators.

For each k, suppose that β(k) is a smooth form on the ball [formula] such that [formula] Identify β(k) with a form in [formula] by extending with zero. Then there is constant C independent of k such that

[formula]

Moreover, if the sequence of norms [formula] is bounded, then there is a subsequence of [formula] which converges uniformly with all derivatives on any ball in [formula] to a smooth form β, where β is in [formula]

Fix a ball BR, of radius R in [formula] By G�rding's inequality for the elliptic operator [formula] we have the following estimates for the Sobolev norm of β(k)on the ball BR with 2m derivatives in L2:

[formula]

for all positive integers m. Since [formula] converges to [formula] on the ball B2 it is straight forward to see that CR,k may be taken to be independent of k. Hence, for all positive integers m,

[formula]

and the continuous injection [formula] provided by the Sobolev embedding theorem, proves the first statement in the lemma. To prove the second statement assume that [formula] is uniformly bounded in k. Then [\ref=proofLemmaGardingA] shows that

[formula]

Since this holds for any m  ≥  1, Rellich's compactness theorem yields, for each R, a subsequence of [formula], which converges in all Sobolev spaces L2,k(BR) for k  ≥  0. The compact embedding [formula] shows that the sequence converges in all Cl(BR). Choosing a diagonal sequence, with respect to a sequence of balls exhausting [formula] finishes the proof of the lemma.

Before turning to the proof of the local weak holomorphic Morse inequalities, theorem, we state the following facts about the model case, that will be proved in the following section:

[formula]

Moreover, suppose that the first q eigenvalues of the quadratic form φ0 are negative and the rest are positive (which corresponds to the case when x is in X(q)). Then

[formula]

unless I = (1,2,...,q).

Let (X,ω) be a hermitian manifold. Then the Bergman kernel function Bq,kX and the extremal function Sq,kXof the space of global [formula]harmonic (0,q) forms with values in Lk, satisfy

[formula]

where

[formula]

and [formula] if one of the limits exists.

First we will prove that

[formula]

By definition, there is a unit norm sequence αk in H0,q(X,Lk) such that

[formula]

Now consider the sequence [formula] where β(k) is a form on the ball [formula] that we identify with a form in [formula] by extending with zero. Note that

[formula]

where we have used the norm localization [\ref=norm_localization]. According to the previous lemma there is a subsequence of [formula] that converges uniformly with all derivatives to β on any ball in [formula] where β is smooth and [formula] Hence, we have that [formula] which follows from the expansion [\ref=operator_localization], showing that

[formula]

Moreover, by proposition [\ref=prop:modelB],

[formula]

Lemma [\ref=lemma:_comparing_B_and_S_in_general], then shows that [formula] outside the set X(q).

Next, if x is in X(q) we may assume that λ1 up to λq are the negative eigenvalues. By [\ref=S_component_in_model] we then have that βI = 0 if I  ≠  (1,2,...,q). We deduce that for I  ≠  (1,2,...,q):

[formula]

This proves that

[formula]

if I  ≠  (1,2,...,q). Finally, lemma [\ref=lemma:_comparing_B_and_S_in_general] shows that

[formula]

which finishes the proof of the theorem.

As a corollary we obtain Demailly's weak holomorphic Morse inequalities:

Suppose that X is compact. Then

[formula]

Let us first show that the sequence k- nSq,kX(x) is dominated by a constant if X is compact. Since X is compact it is enough to prove this for a sufficintly small neighbourhood of a fixed point x0. Now, for a given form αk in H0,q(X,Lk) consider its restriction to a ball of radius [formula] with center in x0. Using G�rding's inequality [\ref=proofLemmaGardingA] as in lemma [\ref=lemma:bootstrap], we see that there is a constant C(x0), depending continuosly on x0 such that

[formula]

for k larger than k0(x0), say. Morever, we may assume that the same k0(x0) works for all x sufficiently close to x0. Using the norm localization [\ref=norm_localization] we get that

[formula]

for k larger than k1(x0) and the same k1 works for all x sufficiently close to x0. This proves that k- nSq,kX(x) is dominated by a constant if X is compact. By [\ref=lemma:_comparing_B_and_S_in_general] and the fact that X has finite volume, this means that the sequence k- nBq,kX(x) is dominated by an L1  -  function. Finally, the Hodge theorem shows that

[formula]

and Fatou's lemma yields, since the sequence k- nBq,kX is L1  -   dominated,

[formula]

where we have used the previous theorem and the fact that

[formula]

on X(q).

If there is no point where the curvature two-form is non-degenerate and has exactly one negative eigenvalue, then Demailly observed (see [\cite=d2]) that combining his weak inequalities with their strong counterparts, gives that

[formula]

Now, if one also uses theorem [\ref=thm:localweak] one gets the following asymptotic expression for the Bergman kernel function:

[formula]

almost everywhere on the part of X where the curvature two-form is strictly positive (on the complement the limit is zero). This seems to be a new result. In case L is stricly positive on all of X a complete asymptotic expansion of B0,kX is known ([\cite=z]).

The model case

In this section we will be concerned with [formula] with its standard metric. Any smooth function φ defines a hermitian metric on the trivial line bundle and associated bundles, via [formula] Explicitly, this means that if [formula] is a (0,q) - form on [formula] , then

[formula]

The standard differential operators on smooth functions are extended to operators on forms, by letting them act componentwise. We denote by [formula] the formal adjoint of [formula] with respect to the norm induced by φ. A partial integration shows that

[formula]

The following classical commutation relations ([\cite=h]) are essential for what follows:

[formula]

In this section [formula] so that the right hand side simplifies to δijλii.

The next lemma gives an explicit expression for [formula] that will enable us to compute the model Bergman kernel function.

We have that

[formula]

with respect to the fiber metric φ0 on the trivial line bundle.

All adjoints and formal adjoints are taken with respect to φ0. The following notation will be used. We let [formula] act on forms by wedge multiplication, and denote the adjoint by [formula] Then we have the anti-commutation relations

[formula]

Also,

[formula]

[formula] can now be expressed as

[formula]

Applying   *   to this relation immediately yields

[formula]

Now we compute [formula]

[formula]

By applying [\ref=proofofModelLaplaceA] to second term and splitting the sum this equals

[formula]

According to the commutation relation [\ref=identity:_commutation_1] the second sum vanishes and [\ref=proofModelLaplaceB] finally gives that

[formula]

In order to be able to integrate partially in [formula] without getting boundary terms, the following lemma is useful. See [\cite=gro] for a slightly more general proof. The point is to choose [formula] where χ is a smooth compact supported function, that equals 1 on the unit ball, say.

There is an exhaustion sequence χR such that for any smooth function f and smooth (0,q) -  form α with f, [formula] α and [formula] in [formula]

[formula]

and similarly for [formula]

Next, we turn to the Bergman kernel function [formula] and the extremal function [formula]. They are defined as in section [\ref=section:_dimension] [\ref=...] but with respect to the space [formula] of all (0,q) - forms in [formula] that are [formula]harmonic with respect to the fiber metric φ0 and have finite L2 norm with respect to φ0. Note that with notation as in section [\ref=subsection_statement_of_main_result],

[formula]

if [formula] is the local expression of the fiber metric of L at the point x in X.

The proof of the following proposition is based on a reduction to the case when q = 0 and we are considering holomorphic functions in the so called Fock space. Then it is well-known that

[formula]

Indeed, if f is holomorphic, then [formula] is subharmonic. Hence,

[formula]

where ΔR is a polydisc of radius R and where we have used that φ0 is radial in each variable. Letting R tend to infinity, shows [\ref=bergmankernel_for_holomorphic_f] for [formula]

Assume that q of the numbers λi are negative and the rest are positive. Then

[formula]

Otherwise there are no [formula]harmonic (0,q) - forms in [formula] i.e.

[formula]

With notation as in section [\ref=subsection_statement_of_main_result] this means that

[formula]

Suppose that [formula] and [formula] Then [formula] and we get that

[formula]

Letting R  →    ∞   and using lemma [\ref=lemma:_gromov-trick] shows that

[formula]

Let [formula] where [formula] if i∈I and ζi = zi if i∈Ic. Then [\ref=proodmodela] and [\ref=identity:_adjoint] implies that FI is holomorphic:

[formula]

Moreover,

[formula]

Now assume that it is not the case that q of the numbers λi are negative and the rest are positive. Then [formula] with some ΛIi: = ΛIiI  ≤  0. By assumption, [formula] Now [\ref=proofmodelb] and Fubini-Tonelli's theorem give that

[formula]

Since [formula] and ΛIiI  ≤  0 this forces [formula] and in particular fI(0) = 0,which proves that [formula]

Finally, assume that q of the numbers λi are negative and the rest are positive. We may assume that λ1 up to λq are the negative ones. Then the same argument as the one above gives that fI(0) = 0 if I  ≠  I0: = (1,2,...,q). Now since ΛI0i > 0 for all i we get

[formula]

where we have used [\ref=bergmankernel_for_holomorphic_f] in the last step. Since [formula]this proves the statement about [formula] The proof is finished by observing that [formula] This follows from lemma [\ref=lemma:_comparing_B_and_S_in_general], but it is also easy to see directly in this special case, since all the components FI vanish if I  ≠  (1,2,...,q).

The statement [\ref=S_component_in_model] also follows from the previous proof.

A similar argument to the one in the previous proof shows that if [formula] is non-degenerate and if it is not the case that q of the numbers λi are negative and n - q of the numbers are positive, then there is an apriori estimate of the form

[formula]

where the norms are taken with respect to φ0. The result appears already in H�rmander's seminal paper [\cite=h] and it can be used to give a direct proof of the fact that the global Bergman kernel function Bq,kX vanishes (modulo terms of order o(kn) at a point outside X(q), where the curvature two-form is non-degenerate.

The strong holomorphic morse inequalities

In this section X is assumed to be compact. While the weak holomorphic Morse inequalities give estimates on individual cohomology groups, their strong counter parts say that

[formula]

Let Hq≤  νk(X,Lk) denote the space spanned by the eigenforms of [formula] whose eigenvalues are bounded by νk and denote by Bq,k≤  νk the Bergman kernel function of the space Hq≤  νk(X,Lk). Extending the previous methods (section [\ref=section:weakMorse]) we will show the asymptotic equality

[formula]

where [formula] is a judicially chosen sequence. From its integrated version

[formula]

one can then deduce the strong inequalities [\ref=strong_inequalities] as in [\cite=d1]. The basic idea is as follows. First we obtain an upper bound on the corresponding Bergman kernel function, by a direct generalizaton of the harmonic case: the local weak Morse inequalities. We just have to make sure that terms of the form [formula] which are now non-zero, tend to zero with k. Recall, that [formula] denotes the [formula]-Laplacian with respect to the scaled metrics on the ball [formula] In fact, for scaling reasons they give contributions which are polynomial in[formula] This dictates the choice νk  =  μkk with μk tending to zero with k. The last step is to get a lower bound on the spectral density function on X(q), which amounts to proving the existence of a unit norm sequence [formula] in Hi≤  νk(X,Lk) with

[formula]

To this end we first take a sequence [formula] of (0,q) - forms on [formula] which are harmonic with respect to the flat metric and the fiber metric kφ0, having the corresponding property. The point is that the mass of these forms concentrate around 0, when k tends to infinity. Hence, by cutting down their support to small decreasing balls we obtain global forms [formula] on X, that are of unit norm in the limit. Moreover, their Laplacians are "small". By cutting the high frequencies, that is projecting on Hi≤  νk(X,Lk), we finally get the sought after sequence.

We now proceed to carry out the details of the argument sketched above.

Assume that μk  →  0. Then the following estimate holds:

[formula]

The proof is a simple modification of the proof of the local holomorphic Morse inequalities and in what follows these modifications will be presented. The difference is that αk is in H0,q≤  μkk(X,Lk) and we have to make sure that the all terms of the form [formula] vanish in the limit. But for any ball B,

[formula]

and the last term is bounded by a sequence tending to zero:

[formula]

since by assumption αk is of unit norm and in H0,q≤  μkk(X,Lk) and μk  →  0. G�rding's inequality as in [\ref=proofLemmaGardingA] gives that

[formula]

which shows that the conclusion of lemma [\ref=lemma:bootstrap] is still valid. Finally, [formula] as before and the rest of the argument goes through word by word.

The next lemma provides the sequence that takes the right values at a given point x in X(q), with "small" Laplacian, that was referred to in the beginning of the section.

Let [formula] For any point x0 in X(q) there is a sequence [formula] such that ak is in Ω0,q(X,Lk) with

[formula]

Moreover, there is a sequence δk , independent of x0 and tending to zero, such that

[formula]

We may assume that the first q eigenvalues λi,x0 are negative, while the remaining eigenvalues are positive. Define the following form in [formula]

[formula]

so that [formula] and [formula] Observe that β is in L2,mφ0, the Sobolev space with m derivatives in L2φ0, for all m Now define αk on X by

[formula]

where [formula] and χ is a a smooth function supported on the unit ball, which equals one on the ball of radius [formula] Thus [formula] showing (i). To see (ii) note that

[formula]

and the "tail" [formula] tends to zero, since β is in [formula] and [formula] tends to infinity.

Next, we show (iii). Changing variables (proposition [\ref=scaling_transf_for_laplace]) and using [\ref=operator_localization] gives

[formula]

where Dk is a second order PDO, whose coefficients have derivatives that are uniformly bounded in k. To see that this tends to zero first observe that

[formula]

tends to zero. Indeed, β has been chosen so that [formula] Moreover, [formula] is the square of the first order operator [formula] which also annihilates β and obeys a Leibniz like rule, showing that

[formula]

where γk is a form, uniformly bounded in k, and supported outside the ball [formula] (γk contains second derivatives of χk). Now using [\ref=operator_localization] again we see that [\ref=Laplace_of_beta] is bounded by the norm of

[formula]

where p is a polynomial. Thus [\ref=power_of_laplace_of_alpha] can be estimated by the "tail" of a convergent integral, as in [\ref=tail] - the polynomial does not effect the convergence - which shows that [\ref=Laplace_of_beta] tends to zero. To finish the proof of (iii) it is now enough to show that

[formula]

is uniformly bounded. As above one sees that the integrand is bounded by the norm of

[formula]

for some polynomial q, which is finite as above.

To prove (iv) observe that, as above,

[formula]

Hence, by Leibniz' rule

[formula]

Clearly, there is an expansion for the first order operator [formula] as in [\ref=operator_localization], giving

[formula]

Note that even if [formula] is independent of the eigenvalues λi,x0, the norms [formula]do depend on the eigenvalues, and hence on the point x0. But the dependence amounts to a factor of eigenvalues and since X is compact, we deduce that [formula]is bounded by a constant independent of the point x0. This shows that [formula] Note that εk also can be taken to be independent of the point x0, by a similar argument.

Assume that the sequence μk is such that μk  ≠  0 and [formula] where δk is the sequence appearing in lemma [\ref=lemma:lowenergysequence]. Then, for any point x in X(q), the following holds

[formula]

Let [formula] be the sequence that lemma [\ref=lemma:lowenergysequence] provides and decompose it with respect to the orthogonal decomposition [formula] induced by the spectral decomposition of the elliptic operator [formula]

[formula]

First, we prove that

[formula]

As in the proof of lemma [\ref=lemma:bootstrap] we have that

[formula]

To see that the first term tends to zero, observe that by the spectral decomposition of [formula]

[formula]

Furthermore, the second term also tends to zero:

[formula]

by (iii) in lemma [\ref=lemma:lowenergysequence]. Finally,

[formula]

By [\ref=alphatwo_vanishes] this tends to the limit of [formula] which proves the proposition according to (i) in lemma [\ref=lemma:lowenergysequence] and lemma [\ref=lemma:_comparing_B_and_S_in_general].

Now we can prove the following asymptotic equality:

Let (X,ω) be a compact hermitian manifold. Then

[formula]

for some sequence μk tending to zero.

Let [formula] The theorem then follows immediately from proposition [\ref=prop:Bspectral<] and proposition [\ref=prop:Bspectral>] if x is in X(q). If x is outside of X(q) then the upper bound given by [\ref=prop:Bspectral<] shows that  lim kBq,k≤  μkk(x) = 0, which finishes the proof of the theorem.
