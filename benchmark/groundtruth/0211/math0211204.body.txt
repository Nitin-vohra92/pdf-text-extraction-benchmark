Additive bases for semigroups

Let [formula] and  denote the positive integers, nonnegative integers, and integers, respectively. Let X be an abelian semigroup, written additively, and let A and B be subsets of X. We define the sumset

[formula]

and the restricted sumset

[formula]

In particular, for A  =  B, we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

For every positive integer h we introduce the dilation

[formula]

Then

[formula]

Additive number theory is classically the study of sums of subsets of the semigroup of nonnegative integers. In this paper we extend the classical theory to a large class of abelian semigroups.

If X is a group and A,B  ⊆  X, then we can also define the difference set

[formula]

We have - A  =  {0}  -  A  =  { - a:a∈A}.

Let B be a subset of the semigroup X. We associate to B two representation functions, r̂B(x) and rB(x). The restricted representation function

[formula]

of the set B counts the number of ways an element x∈X can be written as a sum of two distinct elements of B, that is,

[formula]

The representation function

[formula]

of the set B counts the number of ways an element x∈X can be written as a sum of two not necessarily distinct elements of B, that is,

[formula]

If every element of X can be represented as the sum of two distinct elements of B, that is, if [formula], or, equivalently, if r̂B(x)  ≥  1 for all x∈X, then the set B is called a restricted basis for X. If r̂B(x)  ≥  1 for all but finitely many x∈X, then B is called a restricted asymptotic basis for X.

Similarly, if every element of X can be represented as the sum of two not necessarily distinct elements of B, that is, if 2B  =  X, or, equivalently, if rB(x)  ≥  1 for all x∈X, then the set B is called a basis for X. If rB(x)  ≥  1 for all but finitely many x∈X, then the set B is called an asymptotic basis for X.

A famous conjecture of Erd os and Turán [\cite=erdo-tura41] in additive number theory states that if a set B of nonnegative integers is an asymptotic basis or a restricted asymptotic basis for [formula], then the representation functions rB(x) and r̂B(x) must be unbounded. This is still an unsolved problem for the semigroup of nonnegative integers under addition, but analogues of the Erd os-Turán conjecture do hold in some other abelian semigroups. For example, let a and b be nonnegative integers and define [formula] Then [formula] is an abelian semigroup with identity 0. If B is a nonnempty subset of [formula], then 2B  =  B and [formula] in [formula]. It follows that if B is an asymptotic basis or a restricted asymptotic basis for [formula] then B must contain all but finitely many nonnegative integers. Moreover, if [formula] then rB(n)  =  n + 1 - t and r̂B(n)  =  n - t for all sufficiently large n, and so

[formula]

For the semigroup [formula] of positive integers under ordinary multiplication, Erd os [\cite=erdo64a] proved that if B is an asymptotic basis for the multiplicative semigroup , then the representation function rB(n) is unbounded. Ne set ril and Rödl [\cite=nese-rodl85] gave a simple, Ramsey-theoretic proof of this result, and Nathanson [\cite=nath87] and P us [\cite=pus92] generalized Erd os' theorem in different directions.

The story is very different for the abelian group  of integers. There exist subsets B of integers such that [formula] and the representation function rB(x) is bounded. Indeed, Nathanson [\cite=nath03] has constructed "dense" bases B for the integers such that rB(x)  =  1 for all [formula] Similarly, there exist subsets B of integers such that [formula] and r̂B(x)  =  1 for all [formula]. A special case of a theorem in this paper is that there is no constraint on the restricted representation functions of restricted asymptotic bases for the integers, nor on the representation functions of asymptotic bases for the integers. This means that for any function

[formula]

such that

[formula]

there exists a set [formula] such that r̂B(x)  =  f(x) for all [formula] Indeed, we prove that if G is any countable abelian group such that [formula] is infinite, then every function

[formula]

with

[formula]

is the restricted representation function r̂B of some set B  ⊆  G, and is also the representation function r̂B' of some set B'  ⊆  G.

In this paper we study the more general case of additive abelian semigroups of the form [formula] where S is a countable abelian semigroup and G is a countably infinite abelian group. A semigroup of the form [formula], where S is a semigroup and G is a group, will be called a semigroup with a group component. The main result of this paper states that if [formula] is an abelian semigroup with a group component G such that S + S = S and [formula] is infinite, then essentially every function is the representation function of a restricted asymptotic basis for X. A special case of this theorem for groups was obtained by P us [\cite=pus91].

Representation functions of semigroups with a group component

Let S be a countable abelian semigroup, and let G be a countably infinite abelian group. Both S and G are written additively. We do not assume that S is infinite. We shall describe the representation functions of asymptotic bases and restricted asymptotic bases for the additive abelian semigroup

[formula]

For x  =  (s,g)∈X, we have the projection map π:X  →  G defined by π(x)  =  g.

We begin with a simple lemma about abelian groups with finite dilation.

Let h  ≥  2 and let G be a countably infinite abelian group. The dilation [formula] is finite if and only if

[formula]

where G0 is a finite abelian group and Gd is a direct sum of cyclic groups of order d.

Proof.  Let G be a group of the form ([\ref=rf:group]). If the positive integer d divides h and if Γd is a cyclic group of order d, then [formula] and so [formula]. It follows that [formula] is finite.

Conversely, suppose that [formula] is finite. Let γ∈G. For k  ≥  1 we have hkγ  =  h(hk - 1γ), and so

[formula]

Since [formula] is finite, there exist positive integers j  <  k such that hjγ  =  hkγ, and so γ has finite order. Therefore, G is a torsion group.

Let m be the least common multiple of the orders of the elements of the finite set [formula]. Then (mh)γ  =  m(hγ)  =  0 for all γ∈G, and so G is a group of bounded order. Since an abelian group of bounded order is a direct sum of nonnzero cyclic groups (Kaplansky [\cite=kapl54]), we can write

[formula]

where Γd denotes the cyclic group of order d. Let γi be a generator of the group Γdi. Since [formula] is finite, it follows that hγi  =  0 for all but finitely many i. The set

[formula]

is finite, and

[formula]

is a finite abelian group. If hγi  =  0, then γi has order d for some divisor d of h, d  ≥  2. For every divisor d of h with d  ≥  2, we define

[formula]

and

[formula]

The set [formula] is infinite, and

[formula]

This completes the proof. [formula]

Let [formula] denote the direct sum of an infinite number of cyclic groups of order 2.

Let G be a countably infinite abelian group. Then [formula] is finite if and only if

[formula]

for some finite abelian group G0.

Proof.  This is the special case of Lemma [\ref=rf:lemma:boundedorder] for h = 2. [formula]

We consider semigroups S with the property that S + S = S. Equivalently, for every s∈S there exist s',s''∈S such that s  =  s'  +  s''. Every semigroup with identity has this property, since s  =  s  +  0. If S is any totally ordered set without a smallest element, and if we define s1  +  s2  =   max (s1,s2), then S is an abelian semigroup such that s  =  s + s for all s∈S, but S does not have an identity element.

Let S be a countable abelian semigroup such that for every s∈S there exist s',s''∈S with s  =  s'  +  s''. Let G be a countably infinite abelian group such that the dilation [formula] is infinite. Consider the abelian semigroup [formula] with projection map π:X  →  G. Let

[formula]

be any map such that the set

[formula]

is a finite subset of G. Then there exists a set B  ⊆  X such that

[formula]

for all x∈X, where r̂B(x) denotes the number of sets {b,b'}  ⊆  B such that b  ≠  b' and b + b' = x.

Note that Theorem [\ref=rf:theorem:1] is not true for all abelian semigroups. For example, let  be the additive semigroup of positive integers under addition, and [formula] For every set B  ⊂  X we have r̂B(1,n)  =  rB(1,n)  =  0 for every [formula].

Proof.  We shall construct inductively an increasing sequence [formula] of finite subsets of X such that the set [formula] has the property that r̂B(x)  =  f(x) for all x∈X.

Since the dilation [formula] is infinite and the set [formula] is finite, we can choose an infinite subset U of G such that [formula], and, if u,u'∈U and u  ≠  u', then 2u  ≠  2u'.

Let {xi}∞i = 1 be a sequence of elements of X such that, for every x∈X,

[formula]

Let [formula] Then f(x1)  ≥  1. Since U is infinite, we can choose u1∈U such that

[formula]

Choose s'1,s1''∈S such that s1  =  s'1  +  s2''. We define

[formula]

Then (s1',g1 - u1)  ≠  (s1'',u1) and

[formula]

Then

[formula]

and so

[formula]

Let n  ≥  2, and suppose that we have constructed finite sets

[formula]

such that

[formula]

and, for [formula]

[formula]

Let xn  =  (sn,gn)∈X. If r̂Bn - 1(xn)  =  f(xn), then we set Bn  =  Bn - 1. Suppose that r̂Bn - 1(xn)  <  f(xn). Since U is an infinite subset of the group G and π(Bn - 1) and [formula] are finite subsets of G, we can choose an element un∈U satisfying the following conditions:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Choose sn',sn''∈S such that sn  =  sn'  +  sn'', and let

[formula]

It follows from (i) and (ii) that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

It follows from (iii) and (iv) that

[formula]

and that

[formula]

Similarly, (v) and (vi) imply that

[formula]

and that

[formula]

It follows from (vii) that

[formula]

Conditions (ii) and (iii) imply that

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

and

[formula]

hence r̂Bn(x)  ≤  f(x) for all x∈X.

This construction produces a sequence {Bn}∞n = 1 of finite sets with the property that the infinite set [formula] satisfies r̂B(x)  =  f(x) for all x∈X. This completes the proof. [formula]

Let G be a countably infinite abelian group such that the dilation [formula] is infinite. Let

[formula]

be any map such that the set

[formula]

is a finite subset of G. Then there exists a restricted asymptotic basis B of order 2 for G such that

[formula]

for all x∈X, where r̂B(x) denotes the number of sets {b,b'}  ⊆  B such that b  ≠  b' and b + b' = x.

Proof.  This follows immediately from Theorem [\ref=rf:theorem:1] with S  =  {0}. [formula]

By the same methods we can prove the following theorems about unrestricted representation functions. In the unrestricted case, there are additional conditions that must be satisfied for the proofs to work. It suffices to replace [formula] by [formula] in the statements of the Theorems [\ref=rf:theorem:3] and [\ref=rf:theorem:4].

Let S be a countable abelian semigroup such that for every s∈S there exist s',s''∈S with s  =  s'  +  s''. Let G be a countably infinite abelian group such that the dilation [formula] is infinite. Consider the abelian semigroup [formula] with projection map π:X  →  G. Let

[formula]

be any map such that the set

[formula]

is finite. Then there exists a set B  ⊆  X such that

[formula]

for all x∈X, where rB(x) denotes the number of sets {b,b'}  ⊆  B such that b + b' = x.

Let G be a countably infinite abelian group such that the dilation [formula] is infinite. Let

[formula]

be any map such that the set

[formula]

is finite. Then there exists an asymptotic basis B of order 2 for G such that

[formula]

for all x∈X, where rB(x) denotes the number of sets {b,b'}  ⊆  B such that b + b' = x.

Bases for groups of exponent 2

Let [formula] be an abelian semigroup with group component G. If [formula] is finite, then it is an open problem to classify the representation functions of asymptotic bases and restricted asymptotic bases for X. We know from Lemma [\ref=rf:lemma:order2] that [formula] where G0 is a finite abelian group. Replacing the semigroup S with [formula] we see that it suffices to consider semigroups of the form [formula]. Even the special case S  =  {0} and X  =  Γ∞2 is a mystery. If x,x'∈Γ∞2, then x  +  x'  =  0 if and only if x  =  x', and so, for any subset B of Γ∞2, we have r̂B(0)  =  0, rB(0)  =  (B), and r̂B(x)  =  rB(x) for all x  ≠  0.

The following result shows another constraint on the representation functions of asymptotic bases for Γ∞2.

Let G  =  Γ∞2 be an infinite direct sum of cyclic groups of order 2. Let B be a subset of G, and let r̂B(x) be the restricted representation function of B. If r̂B(x)  ≥  2 for some x∈G, then there exist elements y,z∈G such that r̂B(y)  ≥  2 and r̂B(z)  ≥  2, and the elements x,y, and z are distinct.

Proof.  If r̂B(x)  ≥  2, then there exist distinct elements a,b,c,d∈G such that

[formula]

Since every element of G has order 2, we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

and so r̂B(y)  ≥  2 and r̂B(z)  ≥  2. The elements x,y, and z are distinct. This completes the proof. [formula]

Let G  =  Γ∞2, and let [formula] be a function such that f(x)  ≥  1 for all x∈G, and f(x)  ≥  2 for exactly one or two elements of G. There does not exist a set B in G such that r̂B(x)  =  f(x).

Proof.  This follows immediately from Lemma [\ref=rf:lemma:Gamma2]. [formula]

It is not hard to construct a basis B for Γ∞2 such that rB(x)  =  1 for all x  ≠  0, but it is an open problem to describe all representation functions for this group.
